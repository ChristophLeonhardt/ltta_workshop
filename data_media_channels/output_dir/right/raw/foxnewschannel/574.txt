YOU WILL HEAR FROM HIM IN A

6
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:14,263
MOMENT.

00:00:14,263 --> 00:00:15,732
BUT FIRST, WE WANT TO GET YOU

00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:16,099

LAST MINUTE CHARACTER

00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,604
ASSASSINATION WHILE ADDING HE

00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,106

14
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,073
INTIMIDATED INTO

WITHDRAWALLING.

16
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,210
THIS COMES AS A SECOND ACCUSER

17
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,711
HAS COME FORWARD ACCUSING

18
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:30,313
KAVANAUGH OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT

19
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:32,782
DURING A PARTY WHEN THEY WERE

20
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:33,616
STUDENTS AT YALE.

21
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:37,721
THE WOMAN IDENTIFIED AS DEBBIE

22
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:39,322
RAMIREZ IS ADMITTING TO "THE

23
00:00:39,322 --> 00:00:40,957
NEW YORKER" SHE IS NOT CERTAIN

24
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,492
IT WAS KAVANAUGH AT FIRST AND

25
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:44,327
ACKNOWLEDGES THERE ARE GAPS IN

26
00:00:44,327 --> 00:00:45,695
HER MEMORY OF THE EVENING

27
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:49,332
BECAUSE SHE WAS DRINKING.

28
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:51,234
THE AUTHOR WHO COWROTE THE

29
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:54,104
PIECE EXPLAINS MORE ABOUT THE

30
00:00:54,104 --> 00:00:55,372
UNCORROBORATED CLAIMS.

31
00:00:55,372 --> 00:00:56,740
>> AT FIRST SHE WASN’T SURE IT

32
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,041
WAS KAVANAUGH, WHEN YOU FIRST

33
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,643
CAME TO HER LAST WEEK.

34
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,913

CONFIDENT IT WAS HIM.

44
00:01:07,184 --> 00:01:08,385
>> GEORGE, THAT IS EXTREMELY

45
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:09,820
TYPICAL OF THE STORIES.

46
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,321
WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH

47
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,589
TRAUMA, ALCOHOL, MANY YEARS IN

48
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:13,090
BETWEEN.

49
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,325
I THINK THE MORE CAUTIOUS

50
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:15,893
WITNESSES I HAVE DEALT WITH IN

51
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:17,695
CASES LIKE THIS, VERY

52
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:18,996
FREQUENTLY SAY, "I WANT TO

53
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,731
TAKE TIME TO DECIDE, I WANT TO

54
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:21,765
TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE INVOLVED.

55
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:23,634
I WANT TO SEARCH MYSELF AND

56
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:26,103
MAKE SURE THAT I CAN

57
00:01:26,103 --> 00:01:27,771
AFFIRMATIVELY STAND BY THE

58
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:28,205
CLAIMS."

59
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:30,574
>> Jesse: FARROW CAUSING

60
00:01:30,574 --> 00:01:32,843
CONTROVERSY WHEN EXPLAINING

61
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:33,844
WHY MS. RAMIREZ DECIDED TO

62
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,947
SPEAK OUT NOW.

63
00:01:35,947 --> 00:01:37,615
>> SHE CAME FORWARD BECAUSE

64
00:01:37,615 --> 00:01:39,584
SENATE DEMOCRATS BEGAN LOOKING

65
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,452
AT THE CLAIM.

66
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:42,787
THIS CAME TO THE ATTENTION OF

67
00:01:42,787 --> 00:01:44,689
PEOPLE ON THE HILLED

68
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:45,122
INDEPENDENTLY.

69
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:47,391
IT HAS CORNERED HER TO AWKWARD

70
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:48,326
POSITION.

71
00:01:48,326 --> 00:01:49,127
SHE TOOK TIME TO TO THINK

72
00:01:49,127 --> 00:01:51,362
ABOUT IT CAREFULLY.

73
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:52,597
SHE SAID, "I DON’T WANT TO

74
00:01:52,597 --> 00:01:55,199
RUIN ANYBODY’S LIFE" BUT SHE

75
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,668
FEELS THIS IS A SERIOUS CLAIM

76
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:58,036
AND CONSIDERS HER MEMORIES

77
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:01,506
CREDIBLE AND FELT SHE WAS

78
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:03,007
FORCED TO TELL HER STORY.

79
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:06,478
>> Jesse: THIS IS WHAT WAS

80
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:07,612
SAID IN THE EXCLUSIVE

81
00:02:07,612 --> 00:02:12,384
INTERVIEW MARTHA MacCALLUM

82
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:12,817
TONIGHT.

83
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:14,686
>> THE TRUTH IS I HAVE NEVER

84
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:15,587
ASSAULTED ANYONE IN HIGH

85
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:16,421
SCHOOL OR OTHERWISE.

86
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:18,023
I AM NOT QUESTIONING OR HAVE

87
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:20,125
NOT QUESTIONED THAT PERHAPS

88
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,326
DR. FORD WAS SEXUALLY

89
00:02:21,326 --> 00:02:23,361
ASSAULTED AT SOME POINT AT ANY

90
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:24,830
POINT IN SOME PLACE BUT I KNOW

91
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,433
I HAVE NEVER SEXUAL ASSAULTED

92
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:28,867
ANYONE.

93
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:29,668
>> Jesse: WHAT DO YOU THINK

94
00:02:29,668 --> 00:02:31,503
OF THE PROCESS OF WHICH THE

95
00:02:31,503 --> 00:02:33,005
WOMAN’S STORY CAME OUT?

96
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:35,440
SHE IS REACHED BY THE SENATE

97
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,611
DEMOCRAT STAFFERS AND THEN, I

98
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:40,445
BELIEVE, MAYBE SHE IS COACHED

99
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:44,516
OR MASSAGED BY LAWYERS AND

100
00:02:44,516 --> 00:02:45,717
DEMOCRAT ACTIVISTS TO

101
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:48,253
REMEMBERING WHAT SHE BELIEVES

102
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:50,923
WAS A SEXUAL MISCONDUCT

103
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:53,626
SITUATION, ABOUT 35 YEARS AGO.

104
00:02:53,626 --> 00:02:54,860
DOES THAT STRIKE YOU AS

105
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,828
STRANGE AT ALL?

106
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:57,863
>> YOU KNOW WHAT STRIKES ME AT

107
00:02:57,863 --> 00:02:59,965
STRANGE THAT YOU HAVE FARROW

108
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:02,268
WHO HAD A GOOD REPUTATION, WHO

109
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:03,636
NOW COMES OUT AND SAYS WELL,

110
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:05,204
YOU KNOW, BASED ON MY

111
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:06,639
EXPERIENCE, IT’S NOT UNUSUAL

112
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,809
TO SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

113
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:10,609
YOU’RE WRONG.

114
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:12,244
BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, 35

115
00:03:12,244 --> 00:03:13,412
YEARS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT,

116
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:14,914
CREATING A SEX CRIMES UNIT,

117
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:16,248
TRYING RAPE CASES, LISTENING

118
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:17,817
TO COMPLAINTS YOU DON’T HAVE

119
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:19,518
SOMEONE SAY I NEED SIX DAYS TO

120
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:20,720
FIGURE OUT WHO IT WAS.

121
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,021
AND THEN NEEDS TO CONSULT WITH

122
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:22,655
THEIR ATTORNEY.

123
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:25,224
THEY USUALLY AT THAT POINT IF

124
00:03:25,224 --> 00:03:26,325
THEY BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS

125
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:28,995
SOME KIND OF SEXUAL ASSAULT OR

126
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:30,129
MISCONDUCT, THEY KNOW WHO DID

127
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:30,496
IT.

128
00:03:30,496 --> 00:03:32,432
AND THE SIX DAYS ARE TO DECIDE

129
00:03:32,432 --> 00:03:33,466
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO GO

130
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:36,836
OUT AND TELL THE STORY.

131
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:38,304
SHE SAYS SHE CAME OUT WITH IT

132
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:40,039
BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO TELL HER

133
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:40,907
STORY BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE

134
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:41,307
DOES.

135
00:03:41,307 --> 00:03:42,609
THE BOTTOM LINE.

136
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:45,111
IF YOU CAN’T FIND A

137
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:45,979
CORROBORATING WITNESS TO

138
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:49,849
CONFIRM WHAT YOU ARE ALLEGING

139
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:51,151
WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH WHO ELSE

140
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:52,852
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT TELLING

141
00:03:52,852 --> 00:03:53,887
YOUR STORY BECAUSE THERE IS NO

142
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:54,320
STORY.

143
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,289
BUT I CAN START WITH DUE

144
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:56,623
PROCESS.

145
00:03:56,623 --> 00:03:58,158
NOWHERE NEAR THE DELAYED

146
00:03:58,158 --> 00:03:59,292
DEMOCRAT COMPLAINTS.

147
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:00,393
>> Jesse: SO JUAN, IF YOU

148
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:01,595
HAVE NO WITNESSES TO THE

149
00:04:01,595 --> 00:04:02,429
ALLEGED MISCONDUCT AND THEN

150
00:04:02,429 --> 00:04:03,964
YOU WERE CALLING AROUND SOME

151
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:05,165
OF YOUR FRIENDS BACK AT YALE

152
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:08,268
ON THE PHONE AND SAYING, "YOU

153
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:08,668
KNOW WHAT?

154
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:10,103
IT MAY HAVE BEEN KAVANAUGH, IT

155
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:11,571
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN KAVANAUGH.

156
00:04:11,571 --> 00:04:13,140
DO YOU THINK IT WAS KAVANAUGH?

157
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,208
I CAN’T QUITE REMEMBER."

158
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,510
THEN ANOTHER FEMALE ASSOCIATE,

159
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,978
HER BEST FRIEND SAYS SHE NEVER

160
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:19,146
TOLD ME ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

161
00:04:19,146 --> 00:04:21,048
DOES THIS TELL YOU THAT MAYBE

162
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:23,517
SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE IT EXACTLY

163
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:24,985
RIGHT ABOUT SPECIFICALLY

164
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:25,419
KAVANAUGH?

165
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,154
>> Juan: YEAH, IT DOES.

166
00:04:27,154 --> 00:04:30,057
I THINK THAT SHE IS SAYING OF

167
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:31,158
HER OWN VOLITION SHE WANTS TO

168
00:04:31,158 --> 00:04:32,159
BE SURE.

169
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,827
THAT SHE THINKS IT’S SUCH A

170
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:34,928
SERIOUS ALLEGATION SHE TOOK

171
00:04:34,928 --> 00:04:37,031
TIME AND SHE IS PUTTING ALL OF

172
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:38,565
YOUR DOUBTS OUT IN PUBLIC.

173
00:04:38,565 --> 00:04:40,301
SHE IS NOT TRYING TO SAY OH,

174
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:41,502
I’M CERTAIN WHEN SHE IS NOT

175
00:04:41,502 --> 00:04:41,835
CERTAIN.

176
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:43,804
SHE IS SAYING I’M NOT CLEARLY

177
00:04:43,804 --> 00:04:44,138
CERTAIN.

178
00:04:44,138 --> 00:04:44,872
I WAS DRINKING.

179
00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:47,508
SO I THINK THAT IS PRETTY

180
00:04:47,508 --> 00:04:48,809
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

181
00:04:48,809 --> 00:04:51,145
RONIN FARROW SAYS HE CONSIDERS

182
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:52,446
WHAT HE DID HIGH LEVEL OF

183
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:52,813
EVIDENCE.

184
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:55,750
I’M QUOTING.

185
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,386
AND SAYS THAT DIRECT ACCOUNT

186
00:04:58,386 --> 00:05:00,288
FROM PEOPLE SHE TOLD RIGHT

187
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:04,659
AFTERWARD THIS HAPPENED WITH

188
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:05,326
KAVANAUGH.

189
00:05:05,326 --> 00:05:07,628
THAT IS WHAT FARROW SAYS.

190
00:05:07,628 --> 00:05:10,398
HE SAYS HE APPLIED THAT IN

191
00:05:10,398 --> 00:05:11,933
OTHER STORIES OF SIMILAR

192
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,501
INSTANCES OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT

193
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:16,404
AND SAYS IT HAS PROVEN TO BE

194
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:17,305
IRONCLAD AND A GOOD WAY TO DO

195
00:05:17,305 --> 00:05:18,439
IT AND HE CONSIDERS THIS IS A

196
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,208
HIGH STANDARD OF JOURNALISM.

197
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,309
>> Jesse: I DIDN’T KNOW THAT

198
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:22,877
IS THE WAY HE WENT ABOUT IT.

199
00:05:22,877 --> 00:05:24,045
THOUGHT HE FOUND SOMEONE WHO

200
00:05:24,045 --> 00:05:25,213
HEARD SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAD

201
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:25,580
HAPPENED.

202
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,282
NOT THAT THIS WOMAN HAD TOLD A

203
00:05:27,282 --> 00:05:31,286
FRIEND ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS.

204
00:05:31,286 --> 00:05:32,287
>> Lisa: THE PIECE SAYS THEY

205
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,122
HAVE NOT CONFIRMED WITH OTHER

206
00:05:34,122 --> 00:05:35,090
EYEWITNESSES THAT KAVANAUGH

207
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,859
WAS PRESENT AT THE PARTY.

208
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:38,727
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" REACHED

209
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:40,829
OUT TO SEVERAL DOZEN

210
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:42,097
INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO

211
00:05:42,097 --> 00:05:42,764
CORROBORATE THE STORY AND

212
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:43,098
COULD.

213
00:05:43,098 --> 00:05:44,599
NO AND EVEN REPORTED THAT

214
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:45,567
RAMIREZ HERSELF WAS CALLING TO

215
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:46,968
ASK IF THEY COULD RECALL THIS

216
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:47,469
FROM HAPPENING.

217
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:49,171
THIS IS PRETTY CLEAR TO

218
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:51,740
EVERYONE WHAT IS GOING ON NOW.

219
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,342
THE #MeToo MOVEMENT CREATED

220
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:54,643
AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE ARE

221
00:05:54,643 --> 00:05:56,044
COERCED TO SIMPLY BELIEVE A

222
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:57,779
WOMAN BECAUSE OF HER GENDER.

223
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,548
DEMOCRATS ARE TAKING

224
00:05:59,548 --> 00:06:00,949
ADVANTAGE, MANIPULATING THAT

225
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:01,350
ENVIRONMENT.

226
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,919
AND NOW WEAPONIZING THE

227
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,387
UNCORROBORATED ACCUSATIONS AS

228
00:06:05,387 --> 00:06:06,989
A POLITICAL TOOL TO CLOBBER

229
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:08,891
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WITH.

230
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:09,825
IT’S DISINGENUOUS AND

231
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:10,425
DANGEROUS.

232
00:06:10,425 --> 00:06:11,894
FRANKLY, THE "NEW YORKER"

233
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:13,195
SHOULD BE ASHAMED THEY RAN THE

234
00:06:13,195 --> 00:06:14,730
STORY TO BEGIN WITH.

235
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,698
>> Jesse: GREG, IF YOU LOOK

236
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:16,465
BACK TO THE WEEKEND.

237
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:18,467
ONE OF THE ALLEGED WITNESSES

238
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:20,035
WITH DR. FORD, FEMALE, GOOD

239
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:22,471
FRIEND, CAME OUT AND SAID I

240
00:06:22,471 --> 00:06:23,272
NEVER HEARD OF THIS.

241
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:25,141
NOT SURE ABOUT THE PARTY.

242
00:06:25,141 --> 00:06:27,309
DON’T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

243
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:27,610
THIS.

244
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,844
THEN YOU HAVE A SECOND AD

245
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:31,046
VICTIM COME OUT -- ALLEGED

246
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:31,547
VICTIM COME OUT.

247
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:34,884
WHAT DOES THE PATTERN TELL YOU

248
00:06:34,884 --> 00:06:35,618
NOW?

249
00:06:35,618 --> 00:06:36,252
>> Greg: DIANNE FEINSTEIN

250
00:06:36,252 --> 00:06:37,787
COULD RUN AN AIRLINE WITH THAT

251
00:06:37,787 --> 00:06:38,554
KIND OF TIMING.

252
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:39,889
I WAS PERFECTLY TIMED.

253
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:41,691
YOU HAVE A LONG-TIME FRIEND,

254
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:42,959
FOURTH PERSON IN THE STORY

255
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,526
WITH NO RECOLLECTION.

256
00:06:43,526 --> 00:06:43,826
BOOM!

257
00:06:43,826 --> 00:06:45,161
IT WAS A SATURDAY.

258
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:47,296
SUNDAY YOU HAD NEW ACCUSATION.

259
00:06:47,296 --> 00:06:49,265
WHAT WORRIES ME IN THE BIG

260
00:06:49,265 --> 00:06:50,366
PICTURE WE ARE SHIFTING THE

261
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:51,934
MEANING OF THE WORD

262
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:53,636
"CORROBORATION" BEFORE AN

263
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:55,538
ACCUSATION WOULD REQUIRE

264
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:56,239
COLLABORATION, WHICH MEANT

265
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:57,507
WITNESSES AND EVIDENCE WHICH

266
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:58,941
THE FORD CASE SEEMED TO LOOK.

267
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:01,578
NOW THIS OTHER ONE SEEMS

268
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:02,378
WEAKER THAN FORD.

269
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:03,546
SO YOU CORROBORATE ONE

270
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:04,848
ALLEGATION WITH WHAT?

271
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:05,548
ANOTHER ALLEGATION.

272
00:07:05,548 --> 00:07:06,883
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MEDIA

273
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:08,551
IS LESS INCLINED TO DIVE DEEP

274
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:10,353
IN THE STORY.

275
00:07:10,353 --> 00:07:11,588
INSTEAD JUST PILE WELL, IT

276
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:14,057
MUST HAVE HAPPENED BECAUSE NOW

277
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:15,859
IT’S QUANTITY NOT QUALITY.

278
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:16,660
>> THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL

279
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:16,960
POINT.

280
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,495
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING

281
00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:20,497
LIKE THIS IN MY CAREER OVER

282
00:07:20,497 --> 00:07:21,231
THREE DECADES.

283
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:23,033
I’VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY

284
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:25,502
REPRESSED MEMORY CASES IN MY

285
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:25,869
LIFE.

286
00:07:25,869 --> 00:07:27,404
ESPECIALLY AGAINST ONE GUY.

287
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:28,371
>> Greg: YEAH.

288
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:31,341
>> SO THE QUESTION IS, IF

289
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:33,343
THERE IS SOMETHING AWRY GOING

290
00:07:33,343 --> 00:07:34,778
ON, WAS THERE HYPNOSIS?

291
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:36,847
ARE THEY USING CONFABLATION?

292
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:38,615
I DON’T WANT TO GET IN THE

293
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:39,216
WEEDS HERE.

294
00:07:39,216 --> 00:07:40,150
BUT THIS IS THE THING THEY

295
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,852
HAVE A RIGHT TO TRUE CROSS

296
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:42,252
EXAMINATION.

297
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:44,188
THE DEMOCRATS DON’T WANT TRUE

298
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:44,855
CROSS EXAMINATION.

299
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,223
THEY WANT KAVANAUGH TO GO

300
00:07:46,223 --> 00:07:46,857
FIRST.

301
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:48,459
HOW DOES THE DEFENDANT OR THE

302
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:49,593
ACCUSED GO FIRST WHEN HE

303
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:50,327
DOESN’T KNOW WHAT THE

304
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:50,994
ACCUSATION IS?

305
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:53,964
HOW IS IT THE DEFENDANT ABLE

306
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:55,199
TO REBUT AND PRESENT A DEFENSE

307
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,567
WHEN THE COMPLAINING WITNESS

308
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:57,601
DOESN’T GIVE A BILL OF

309
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:58,535
PARTICULARS AS TO WHAT

310
00:07:58,535 --> 00:07:58,903
HAPPENED?

311
00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:01,672
I MEAN THIS IS SO BACKWARDS.

312
00:08:01,672 --> 00:08:03,541
IT’S SO OBVIOUSLY AN

313
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,010
ATTEMPT --

314
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,511
>> Juan: LET’S GO WITH WHAT

315
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:08,279
YOU ARE SAYING.

316
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:08,679
>> GOOD.

317
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:09,647
>> Juan: LET’S HAVE THE

318
00:08:09,647 --> 00:08:10,081
F.B.I. --

319
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:11,315
>> SHE IS OKAY WITH THAT.

320
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:11,982
>> Juan: HAVE THE F.B.I.

321
00:08:11,982 --> 00:08:13,951
COME IN AND SAY HERE IS A FACT

322
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,586
BASIS THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE

323
00:08:15,586 --> 00:08:15,853
ON.

324
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:17,154
AND THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE

325
00:08:17,154 --> 00:08:18,155
CALLING FOR.

326
00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:19,357
>> SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS,

327
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:19,790
JUAN.

328
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,625
>> Juan: NO, LET ME JUST

329
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:20,958
SAY.

330
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:21,993
YOU HAVE A SITUATION HERE

331
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:24,228
WHERE YOU JUST DESCRIBED,

332
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:26,597
JUDGE, ONE SET OF FACTS FROM

333
00:08:26,597 --> 00:08:28,199
ONE PERSON AND ANOTHER SET OF

334
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,467
FACTS FROM ANOTHER.

335
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,335
AND THEN SHE SAYS THE PARTY

336
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:31,702
OCCURRED.

337
00:08:31,702 --> 00:08:33,837
HE SAYS I WASN’T AT THAT

338
00:08:33,837 --> 00:08:34,205
PARTY.

339
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:35,573
HE SAYS I DON’T KNOW WHEN THE

340
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:36,474
PARTY WAS.

341
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,043
HOW CAN HE DENY HE IS AT A

342
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:40,912
PARTY SHE HASN’T IDENTIFIED?

343
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:42,013
>> FIRST, LET ME EXPLAIN

344
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:42,380
SOMETHING.

345
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,347
WHEN SHE SAYS SOMETHING, HE

346
00:08:43,347 --> 00:08:44,649
HAS THE RIGHT TO KNOW

347
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,050
SPECIFICALLY WHAT IT IS.

348
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,018
>> Juan: OKAY.

349
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:48,453
>> BUT IN THE END, THERE IS NO

350
00:08:48,453 --> 00:08:50,054
WAY YOU CAN EVEN CONSIDER

351
00:08:50,054 --> 00:08:51,389
BRINGING IN THE F.B.I.

352
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:53,258
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS A SIMPLE

353
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:53,658
ONE.

354
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,659
EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT

355
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,760
LET’S BRING IN THE F.B.I.

356
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,195
WHY THE HELL HAVEN’T YOU ASKED

357
00:08:57,195 --> 00:08:58,797
THE F.B.I. TO GET INVOLVED?

358
00:08:58,797 --> 00:09:00,298
WHY DID DIANNE FEINSTEIN SIT

359
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:01,466
ON THIS FOR SIX WEEKS?

360
00:09:01,466 --> 00:09:03,835
WHY DID SHE SIT ON IT FOR 36

361
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:04,236
YEARS?

362
00:09:04,236 --> 00:09:06,137
>> Juan: IT WAS ANONYMOUS.

363
00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:06,505
>> IT WAS.

364
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,906
NO THEY KNEW WHO SHE

365
00:09:07,906 --> 00:09:08,340
WEDNESDAY.

366
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,743
>> Juan: -- WHO SHE WAS.

367
00:09:11,743 --> 00:09:12,878
>> Juan: SHE WAS ANONYMOUS.

368
00:09:12,878 --> 00:09:13,945
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU ASKED

369
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:14,246
ABOUT.

370
00:09:14,246 --> 00:09:15,847
IN THIS CASE, WHEN SOMEONE IS

371
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:16,615
NOMINATED FOR THE SUPREME

372
00:09:16,615 --> 00:09:17,883
COURT AND SUDDENLY YOU HAVE

373
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:20,252
ALL THE WORLD’S EYEBALLS FIXED

374
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:21,653
ON THIS GUY.

375
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:24,356
NOW THEY ARE GOING TO FLY

376
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:24,723
SPECK HIM.

377
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:25,791
I DON’T CARE WHO YOU ARE.

378
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:26,592
THAT IS A FACT.

379
00:09:26,592 --> 00:09:28,093
SO SUDDENLY A LOT OF PEOPLE

380
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:29,161
WHO KNEW HIM AND HAD

381
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:29,528
QUESTIONS.

382
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,497
REMEMBER, IN THE SECOND CASE,

383
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:32,564
THAT WOMAN WASN’T COMING

384
00:09:32,564 --> 00:09:32,931
FORWARD.

385
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:34,266
THE WOMAN AT YALE.

386
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:35,367
>> HOW DID THEY FIND HER?

387
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,869
>> Juan: THE DEMOCRAT HEARD

388
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:37,936
STORIES ABOUT --

389
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:42,241
>> WELL THEN WHERE IS THE COB

390
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:43,108
RATING -- CORROBORATING

391
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:44,577
WITNESS TO SAY THEY HEARD FROM

392
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:44,977
SOMEONE.

393
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:45,945
>> I’M WITH YOU, JUDGE.

394
00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:47,413
BRING IN THE F.B.I. IN.

395
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:47,713
>> NO.

396
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:48,948
THE F.B.I. DOESN’T DO THESE

397
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:49,315
CASES.

398
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:50,549
THAT IS WHY THEY HAVEN’T

399
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:51,117
ANSWERED YES.

400
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:52,251
>> Juan: I’LL TELL YOU WHAT

401
00:09:52,251 --> 00:09:53,252
IS INTERESTING GOING ON

402
00:09:53,252 --> 00:09:53,652
TODAY --

403
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:54,987
>> THIS IS ALL CONFUSION AND

404
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:55,421
ALL --

405
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:56,789
>> Juan: NO, NO.

406
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:58,090
WHAT IS INTERESTING THAT

407
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:58,991
MARTHA MacCALLUM TONIGHT

408
00:09:58,991 --> 00:10:01,227
IS GOING TO HAVE KAVANAUGH AND

409
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:02,695
HIS WIFE ON HER SHOW.

410
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:04,297
TO ME THIS IS LIKE WOW!

411
00:10:04,297 --> 00:10:06,666
YOU MEAN A GUY WHO IS UP FOR A

412
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,134
SUPREME COURT NOMINATION

413
00:10:08,134 --> 00:10:09,302
DECIDES IT’S IMPORTANT TO TAKE

414
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:10,369
A BREAK AND DO TV?

415
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:11,070
>> Jesse: I THINK HE IS

416
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:16,309
TRYING TO DEFEND HIMSELF.

417
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:18,211
>> Greg: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

418
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:19,345
YOU CAN’T SMEAR A GUY FROM

419
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:21,414
TRYING TO DEFEND HIMSELF.

420
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:22,749
>> Juan: I’M SAYING BOY, DID

421
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:23,917
YOU SEE THE FOX POLL?

422
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:25,451
THE FOX POLYPED KATES NOW MORE

423
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:26,719
PEOPLE BELIEVE FORD THAN

424
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:28,054
BELIEVE KAVANAUGH.

425
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:29,122
>> Greg: WHAT A SURPRISE

426
00:10:29,122 --> 00:10:30,056
AFTER WHAT HAS BEEN DONE TO

427
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:30,390
HIM.

428
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,392
IF ALLEGATIONS ARE ENOUGH

429
00:10:32,392 --> 00:10:33,159
WITHOUT WITNESS OR WITHOUT

430
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,227
EVIDENCE, YOU SHOULD WORRY

431
00:10:34,227 --> 00:10:35,362
ABOUT YOUR HUSBANDS, YOUR

432
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:37,030
BROTHERS, YOUR SONS AND YOUR

433
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,731
FATHERS.

434
00:10:37,731 --> 00:10:38,431
>> AND YOURSELF.

435
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:40,800
>> Greg: THERE NEEDS TO BE A

436
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,336
NEW WOMAN MOVEMENT CALLED

437
00:10:43,336 --> 00:10:44,271
MOMMA BEAR BECAUSE THEY ARE

438
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:45,505
COMING FOR YOUR SONS.

439
00:10:45,505 --> 00:10:46,706
>> CAN YOU BE PART OF IT IF

440
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:48,642
YOU ARE NOT A MOM?

441
00:10:48,642 --> 00:10:49,709
DON’T EXCLUDE ME, GREG.

442
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:50,811
>> Greg: WHAT IS GOING TO

443
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:51,945
HAPPEN IS BECAUSE YOU CAN’T

444
00:10:51,945 --> 00:10:52,679
NOMINATE MEN ANYMORE?

445
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,914
YOU KNOW WHO IS THE SUPREME

446
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:56,283
COURT JUSTICE?

447
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:57,117
JUDGE PIRRO.

448
00:10:57,117 --> 00:10:58,552
>> NOT A CHANCE!

449
00:10:58,552 --> 00:11:00,253
LET ME TELL YOU, ALL I’D LIKE

450
00:11:00,253 --> 00:11:01,555
TO DO IS QUESTION THE TWO OF

451
00:11:01,555 --> 00:11:01,922
THEM.

452
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:04,524
THAT IS ALL I WANT TO DO.

453
00:11:04,524 --> 00:11:05,225
>> Jesse: MORE PROOF THAT

454
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:06,960
THE FACTS ON KAVANAUGH DON’T

455
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,995
MATTER TO DEMOCRATS.

456
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:10,764
THE LATEST LEFT WING SMEAR

457
00:11:10,764 --> 00:00:00,000
AHEAD.
