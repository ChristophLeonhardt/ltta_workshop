the Oscars start in two hours I gotta
get ready
they never have food at these things the
Oscars are a black-tie affair
cannot go dressed like this ready better
all right goodbye hotel room
next stop the Oscars
security in driving to the Oscars is
bananas here comes the security guy well
there's another one all right this is it
360 I've arrived
no one's here except for a whole bunch
of cops I'm heading to the red carpet
things haven't really kicked off yet but
there's a lot of madness
all right
get security everywhere is swimming
upstream look I love ya half the people
are terrified of this thing and the
other I've been really excited about it
I think some people think it's a
microphone some people think it's an
ice-cream cone let's call my office
that Sun is hot
thinking oh we have tents
kind of open over here and breathe back
in the shadow yeah come right back these
guys out you I'm looking at me looking
me an eyeball it's an it is an eyeball
I'll be right back guys
I will come back
so much excitement
glad nobody stole away
