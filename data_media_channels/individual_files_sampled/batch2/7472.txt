Anthony Weiner was a Democratic congressman who lost the seat had to resign in shame because of reaching out to different women on Twitter and sending sexually explicit messages now he was run out of Congress back in 2011 but then he made a comeback and he was running for mayor of New York and was actually doing really well in the polls in 2013 until we found out he had done it again and that time he had called himself Carlos danger online uh and famously a correspondent with Sydney leathers she turned over a lot of those messages as a lot of people that he sexted with and is there a word first sexual messages on twitter twitter dwith anyway so i but he never learns a lesson he never learns a lesson and then in 2016 he got busted again several different people including an older woman that he I say older because he got in trouble with an underage girl that I'm about to tell you about and and he had sent a picture Oh to the to the to the other woman with his young son who was a baby at the time in the picture oh don't do that he was showing off his abs the baby was next to him uh so finally Huma Abedin who was top advisor for Hillary Clinton I almost said fired him divorced them and and they separated and in part of ways and and of course it wound up famously affecting the 2016 election because the they had a separate investigation on Anthony Weiner criminal investigation because he had sent sexually explicit messages to a fifteen-year-old which is what I'm about to tell you the conclusion of that story now but because of some of those messages were on Huma Abedin computer they had to then reopen the Hillary Clinton investing issue because they they found out that there was all these messages emails on humar biddings computer the FBI had not checked yet now later they checked them and found out there was nothing wrong but by that time the damage had been done and and that was part of what had happened in 2016 to cost Hillary Clinton to lose course the other gigantic part was Hillary Clinton anyway so if you don't remember the part about the 15 year old let me go to the Daily Mail investigation last year and I gave the details Anthony Weiner carried on a month-long online sexual relationship with a 15 year old girl during which she claims he asked her to dress up in schoolgirl outfits for him on a video messaging application and and much worse I mean the details are pretty gory and we don't need to rehash them because he is guilty and I'm gonna tell you about that in a sec but at the time a very important component was did he know that she was 15 it's one thing if you think you're talking to a 38 year old online and it's just online it's another thing if you know she's a 15 year old well Weiner was apparently aware that the girl was underage according to the Daily Mail calm interviews with a girl and her father as well as a cache of online messages so they had the messages they did see them they did show them and eventually we never pled guilty so in fact let me go to the New York Times now that explains that mr. Weiner who pled guilty in May to one count of transferring obscene materials to a minor and had faced up to 10 years in prison now that's a long time of course his lawyers asked for probation saying come on you know he's part of the lead are you really gonna send him to prison of course I was not their technical defense but in essence he's a good upstanding member of the community he had a disease he's fighting disease etc in fact before the sentence was pronounced the New York Times explains mr. Weiner did not so much ask for leniency but trying to make a case that he had accepted responsibility for his crime and that he was a changed man now of course he in fact did want leniency and his lawyers did ask for that but that was his show of contrition oh my god Your Honor I've really learned and he said quote I acted not only unlawfully but immorally and if I had done the right thing I would not be standing before you today so that's pretty clear well so what did the judge say well she said that she agreed with mr. wieners lawyers contention that he was finally receiving effective treatment for a disease sexual compulsion that he was engaging in sex addiction therapy and was don't get me wrong he was not engaging in sex addiction again he was engaging in sex addiction therapy and was making what she called quote an enormous contribution to others suffering from that disease but quote the difficulty here is that this is a very strong compulsion it was so strong she added the despite to very public disclosures and the destruction of his career on two occasions he continued with activity that is certainly true so she finally gave out his sentence 21 months in prison so Wow okay so he is actually going to prison now whenever anyone who was a politician or just generally a member of the elite the establishment etc actually goes to prison it is almost shocking because it's just not something that happens very often in America we definitely have a two-tiered justice system but in this case Anthony Weiner was definitely out of allies no Republican or Democrat any had any interest in him no one in power had any interest in him he was roundly derided by almost everyone in power and his former friends and and I guess once you're out of allies prison is possible 21 months so obviously almost two years in prison for Anthony Weiner which is amazing and just final description to this inglorious end of a career New York Times says that after the hearing ended and judge Cote had left a bench mr. Weiner remained seated between his lawyers arlo devlin-brown and Aaron Manju at the defense table been deeply forward in his chair sobbing his face in his hands so look there's a lot that could be said about this story and this is the one story that I always point to of me being wrong when the story first came out I couldn't believe it I thought no way what was previously thought to be a smart congressman was gonna send penis to women online that's the craziest story I ever heard and there was a thousand false stories and allegations made up in the right-wing press earlier not about him specifically but overall and so I said that that I don't believe the story at all well it turns out the story was true I was wrong and and he and then he did it again and again and again so you know and then the past I've made fun of sexual addiction because I mean we're guys aren't we all sexually addicted and that's a common cliched thing to say but you find out with a linear Weiner no it might be a real thing because he did this despite the fact that he thought it could hurt everyone around him his family his loved ones and absolutely destroys career and he still couldn't help himself so that's no excuse and and certainly the court system didn't find it to be an excuse and that's why he's going to prison but it is interesting that it is a compulsion that drives some to absolute ruin and that is apparently what has happened with Anthony Weiner watch The Young Turks commercial-free downloaded a stream it watch it anyway you like a TYT Network comm slash join
