00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,159
Mexico<font color="#E5E5E5"> with top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group six points</font>

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,019
they were taking on a Swedish side<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,210
had to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a victory I don't know how</font>

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,649
many people fancy their chances<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,050
things look an<font color="#CCCCCC"> awful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot better after 50</font>

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,880
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> now this was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ludwig</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goo</font>

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,590
Stinson<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the breakthrough for</font>

8
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,360
them let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a look at how that goal</font>

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">came about yeah and you know Sweden</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,189
today they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything they deserved</font>

11
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean they they suffered that laid laid</font>

12
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">their defeat to Germany that Toni</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Kroos</font>

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">called that that that could suck</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

14
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,510
energy out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> any football player and</font>

15
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,009
it's something that you carry on for

16
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,500
days<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sweden didn't have days it was</font>

17
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sunday</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> night and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here we have Wednesday</font>

18
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,360
so it was basically straight down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> -</font>

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,489
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to business right away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

20
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:42,719
think they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the energy because</font>

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,550
that must have taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much out of them</font>

22
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,320
the manner of that late defeat against

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,000
the athletes in Sweden<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh they're famous</font>

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,010
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their toughness and mental toughness</font>

25
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you remember someone like it you</font>

26
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,260
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> war for instance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who just</font>

00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,879
stood in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> baseline returned John</font>

30
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,309
mentality thing in Sweden they can

31
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,470
really really when they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to they can</font>

32
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,420
focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things and they did that today</font>

33
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,010
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to remember this game was</font>

34
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">played</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their key 13 boy this is where</font>

35
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,570
the the temporary stands are actually

36
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,850
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stadium and it's fair to say</font>

37
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that game</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

38
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mexican team were in that stand they</font>

39
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,810
were completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> played off the page</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

40
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,030
thought it was an excellent performance

41
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,490
by by Sweden and they deserved<font color="#E5E5E5"> to win</font>

42
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">three now and three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now there's not a</font>

43
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,869
big picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this game because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

44
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:36,090
Sweden got<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a half</font>

45
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it didn't get a penalty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when tavar</font>

46
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,829
I still think when we see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> else has</font>

47
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">been given</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in penalties they should have</font>

48
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,240
had it it was at nil nil<font color="#E5E5E5"> but again</font>

49
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">mental toughness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they took it into</font>

50
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">halftime they had a chat came out firing</font>

51

52
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,909

55
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:58,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember</font>

56
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sweden really needing a victory so they</font>

57
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:01,920
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have relaxed at this point they</font>

58
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,880
would have breathe a little easier

59
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,219
though<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 62 minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this was the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font>

63
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,740

light you know you try to lift the ball

97
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,630
up in that you know can easily just give

98
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,340
it a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

102
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,100
roll the ball<font color="#CCCCCC"> around the grass</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

103
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a it definitely won't go over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

104
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,820
but and if Sweden had any nerves

105
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,709
whatsoever<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know they were certainly</font>

106
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,450
settled by<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Mexico team</font>

107
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">self-destructing really 74</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes it</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> given up the ghost</font>

110
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,209
by at this point they they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> deflated</font>

111
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:03,030
and Sweden<font color="#E5E5E5"> were all over them and three</font>

Mexico I'm not gonna take anything away

116
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,570
from Sweden Sweden were fantastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

117
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think what Sweden did today it was was</font>

118
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,418
one of the best performances from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a team</font>

119

121
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,250
because

122
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,080
with one node<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then what you know</font>

123
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">then then with three no then they're</font>

124

<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going out of the World Cup</font>

125

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> group which was Germany they needed</font>

127
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,310
a result as well and they also knew they

128
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,530
were not<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting it but what happened in</font>

129
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,210
that second<font color="#E5E5E5"> half and the goal started to</font>

130
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,980
go in was the style<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose that</font>

131
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,410
discipline<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all the discipline</font>

the Mexican team but the two games

no doubt<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that they have been a</font>

fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> team in this rule and in</font>

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,120
Sweden's performances I think have been

solid<font color="#E5E5E5"> and today they were excellent and</font>

I'm very many many<font color="#CCCCCC"> congratulations to</font>

great loss<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the competition not only</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of their play I think but also</font>
