the Kevin Spacey accusations maybe more than just another Hollywood elite and major Clinton DNC player mired in sex scandals in fact this may be a sign of positive change when it comes to accountability in Hollywood now for those of you who have not heard about this story after Anthony Rapp is accused Kevin Spacey of sexual misconduct with him when he was 14 years old now it's no secret that the political left mainstream media and Hollywood elite have had a mutually beneficial relationship the good news is because of social media changing in political landscape and alternative news sources that glass castle of protection seems to finally be cracking now why I say this you need to look no further than the first responses from Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein when their accusers first came out Harvey Weinstein's first statement said though I'm trying to do better I know I have a long way to go I decided though I'm going after the NRA and I'm gonna give it my full attention in similar fashion Kevin Spacey says basically I don't remember what happened but I'm really sorry also I'm gay now it seems pretty obvious that both men just quasi admit to their crimes and then reach out to their base almost as if to say hey guys remember we're on the same team remember good news is this didn't work the possible reason for this could be the rise of alternative media giving new options for news for consumers also social media gives you a chance to have any story go viral so everyone can see it also the constant attack on fake news is shaking up that established protective order these recent stories of sexual harassment misconduct and corruption have also caused backlash to major media outlets for not running certain stories most recently NBC for passing on the original Harvey Weinstein's story with faith in the mainstream media falling more and more that protective alliance between mainstream media and Hollywood seems to be falling with it less protection for those who know the right people and more truth and justice for those who do not have that luxury or at least I hope I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood alright if you like this video and others like it please consider becoming a premium member to the rebel that way you'll have first access to pure Hollywood and the entire rebel lineup you
