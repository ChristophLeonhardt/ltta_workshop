00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,071
SLIPPING FROM ALL-TIME HIGHS.

00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:06,740
JOE: "WHAT'D YOU MISS?"

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:12,845
SCARLET: THE TAKE ON THE

5
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:13,680
ELECTION, FISCAL STIMULUS, AND

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,314
THE FED'S NEXT MOVE.

7
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,750
JOE: GEORGE MAGNUS WAYS IN ON

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,987
THE ECONOMY AND TRADE AFTER THE

9
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:21,755
BREXIT VOTE.

10
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:28,328
>> A LIVE UPDATE FROM WASHINGTON

11
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:31,097
, GOING DARK IN COLORADO AND

12
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:31,965
PENNSYLVANIA.

13
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:35,034
SCARLET: WE BEGIN WITH MARKET

14
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:38,638
MINUTES.

15
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:39,472
STOCKS RETREATING FROM RECORD

16
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:42,008
HIGHS.

17
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,943
HOUSING STARTS BEAT ESTIMATES,

18
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:49,182
CPI SOFTER THAN EXPECTED, BUT IT

19
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,683
IS THE COMMENTARY FROM FED

20
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,018
OFFICIALS THAT MAY HAVE CHANGED

21
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:52,685
THE TONE IN THE MARKET.

22
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:56,189
JOE: SOME OF THOSE SAFETY YIELD

23
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,258
PLACE LEADING THE WAY DOWN

24
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,292
TODAY.

25
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,395
OLIVER: I'M GOING TO START WITH

26
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,298
THAT.

27
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:09,335
THAT IS A CLEAR STORY TO EMERGE,

28
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,003
LOSSES IN UTILITIES AND

29
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,372
TELECOMMUNICATIONS STOCKS.

30
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:17,210
DOWN OVER 1%, TO GROUPS THAT HAD

31
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,011
SUPPORTED THE MARKET FOR SO

32
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,514
LONG.

33
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,783
EVEN WHEN THE EXPECTATION FOR

34
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:26,019
RATE HIKES ARE NOT CHANGING TOO

35
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,621
MUCH, WE SAW A BUMP UP IN NEXT

36
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:34,627
BREAK, BUT NOT A HUGE AMOUNT.

37
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,195
LOOK AT THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR,

38
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:42,368
DOWN TODAY, ONLY FOR STOCKS IN

39
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:46,506
THE INDEX WERE OF, MANY LOSING

40
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:51,744
2%.

41
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,681
OIL VERSUS THE ENERGY STOCK

42
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,617
INDEX, A BIT OF DIVERSIONS.

43
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:02,789
-- OF DIVERGENCE.

44
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:07,794
YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE TWO HAVE

45
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,763
SEPARATED, A BIG JUMP IN OIL

46
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:14,967
TODAY, NOT QUITE AS BIG IN THE

47
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:15,702
ENERGY STOCKS, PRETTY FLAT

48
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:16,235
DESPITE THE GAINS.

49
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:20,540
JOE: ON THE GOVERNMENT BOND

50
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,508
MARKET FRONT, THE SPREAD TO

51
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:23,843
BETWEEN THE TWO-YEAR AND THE 10

52
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:24,944
YEAR, DROPPING A LITTLE BIT.

53
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,914
SOME INTERESTING STUFF WITH THAT

54
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:32,885
SLIGHTLY WEAKER CPI PRINT,

55
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:37,457
CAUSING SOME FLATTENING, THEN

56
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,959
THE FEDS DUDLEY CAME OUT AND

57
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,229
SAID A SEPTEMBER RATE HIKE IS

58
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,032
STILL ON THE TABLE.

59
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:50,269
THAT DIP WAS THE KEY EVENT OF

60
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:50,703
THE DAY.

61
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:54,574
SCARLET: THE YEN STRENGTHENING

62
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,309
PAST 100 FOR THE FIRST TIME

63
00:02:56,309 --> 00:03:06,051
SINCE BRAGG SAID -- BREXIT.

64
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:06,786
AS JOE MENTIONED, LOTS OF

65
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,155
QUESTIONS OVER WHAT THE FED DOES

66
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:12,091
NEXT, WITH THE BOJ DOES NEXT,

67
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,427
WHEN IT COMES TO MONETARY

68
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,730
POLICY.

69
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,800
THE POUND RECOVERING FROM A

70
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,334
ONE-MONTH LOW.

71
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,101
YOU CAN SEE THE SLIGHT MOVE

72
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:25,070
HIGHER.

73
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,574
THERE COULD BE AN INCREASE IN

74
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:29,308
CONSUMER PRICES, AND WHAT

75
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:33,246
INTERPRETATION THE IS THAT THERE

76
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,046
IS LESS JUSTIFICATION FOR THE

77
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:35,882
BOE TO EASE.

78
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:40,753
THIS IS A CHART OF DAILY CHANGE.

79
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:47,794
JOE: BIG OUTFLOWS ON FRIDAY,

80
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:48,962
SIGNS THE ENTHUSIASM FOR GOLD IS

81
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,864
FIZZLING.

82
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,834
WE HAVE SEEN A BIG RALLY AND

83
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:59,172
OIL LATELY.

84
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:04,576
NEARLY 2% TODAY.

85
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:05,344
THAT CHART EXPLAINS A LOT.

86
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:09,248
SCARLET: THOSE ARE TODAY'S

87
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:09,782
MARKET MINUTES.

88
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:23,263
JOE: PAUL KRUGMAN JOINS US NOW.

89
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,800
I WANT TO READ A QUOTE AND GET

90
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,868
RIGHT INTO THE BIGGEST STORY IN

91
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,570
THE WORLD, THE ELECTION, WHAT IT

92
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,241
MEANS FOR THE ECONOMY, DONALD

93
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,075
TRUMP WAS RECENTLY QUOTED IN AN

94
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,511
ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES.

95
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,713
WE HAVE THE QUOTE HERE.

96
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:41,547
IF WE CAN BRING IT UP, THIS IS

97
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,651
IT.

98
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,619
HE WAS BASICALLY SAYING WE NEED

99
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,487
TO SPEND MORE.

100
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:58,965
IT IS CALLED PRIMING THE POP.

101
00:04:58,965 --> 00:04:59,832
TO SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DO THAT

102
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:00,600
A LITTLE BIT TO GET THINGS

103
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,000
GOING.

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,870
WE HAVE NO CHOICE -- OTHERWISE,

105
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,672
WE ARE GOING TO DIE ON THE VINE.

106
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,809
>> ON THIS, HE IS RIGHT.

107
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:16,982
IT IS PRETTY MUCH BY ACCIDENT.

108
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:20,053
IT IS TRUE.

109
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:20,820
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

110
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,423
MY STRONG GUESS IS THAT

111
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:27,660
HILLARY'S ECONOMIC ADVISERS

112
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,361
WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE MORE

113
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,563
DEFICIT SPENDING, BUT THEY

114
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:33,299
FIGURE IT IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD

115
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,133
THING TO SAY BECAUSE THE PUBLIC

116
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,802
DOES NOT LIKE THAT, AND SO SHE

117
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:37,870
IS BEING CAUTIOUS.

118
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,074
MINIMAL INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING,

119
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:42,608
WE NEED MORE.

120
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,978
>> HOW DO YOU COME TO THIS

121
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:50,449
CONCLUSION THAT HE CAME TO THIS

122
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:51,150
WITHOUT THE RIGHT REASONS?

123
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:58,124
>> ON ECONOMICS, HE HATES CHINA

124
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:58,558
AND TRADE.

125
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:03,496
EVERYTHING ELSE, HE IS FOR TAX

126
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,698
CUTS FOR THE RICH, INCREASES FOR

127
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,868
THE RICH, HE IS ON ALL SIDES OF

128
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,136
IT.

129
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,238
THIS WEEK, HE IS SAYING THAT'S

130
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,073
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO, BUT THERE

131
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:14,640
IS NO ACTUAL PLAN.

132
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:21,047
SCARLET: WHAT DOES HIS HISTORY

133
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,048
OF BORROWING AND SPENDING TO

134
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:22,982
BUILD HIS EMPIRE TELL YOU ABOUT

135
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,216
HOW HE WOULD APPROACH THE

136
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,184
NATIONAL ECONOMY?

137
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:30,122
>> WE HAVE THIS ILLUSION THAT

138
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:30,923
BUSINESS EXPERIENCE HAS A LOT TO

139
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:36,362
DO WITH RUNNING ECONOMIC POLICY,

140
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,197
BUT THEY ARE BOTH DIFFERENT

141
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:43,135
DOMAINS.

142
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:44,036
IT DOESN'T TELL US MUCH ABOUT

143
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:47,106
WHAT HE WOULD DO.

144
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:50,710
AND PARTICULAR, THE TRUMP STYLE,

145
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,477
BAR A LOT OF MONEY, THEN WALK

146
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,545
AWAY FROM IT.

147
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,781
THAT ISN'T GOING TO WORK FOR THE

148
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:56,582
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, SO NOT

149
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:56,949
USEFUL.

150
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:01,153
JOE: REGARDLESS OF WHETHER HE

151
00:07:01,153 --> 00:07:03,723
STUMBLED INTO THIS BY ACCIDENT,

152
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,557
HIS ECONOMIC VIEWPOINT DOES NOT

153
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,760
SEEM TO BE IN LINE WITH THE

154
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,427
CLASSIC AM CONSERVATIVE,

155
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,662
REPUBLICAN VIEWS WE HAVE HEARD

156
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:18,604
LATELY.

157
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,840
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE REASON IS

158
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,574
THAT YOU HAVE CONSERVATIVE

159
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,308
VOICES GETTING BEHIND HIM.

160
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:26,045
>> THE USUAL SUSPECTS.

161
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:26,979
THE SAME OLD GANG.

162
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,015
THEY ARE MAKING A JUDGMENT THAT

163
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:32,752
WHAT HE WOULD ACTUALLY DO ARE

164
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,054
THE ONES THEY WANT.

165
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,089
ALSO, THEIR THING HAS ALWAYS

166
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:41,461
BEEN LET'S BE WHERE POWER IS,

167
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,261
AND THEY THINK THIS IS THEIR

168
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,163
BEST CHANCE.

169
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,232
OBVIOUSLY THERE WILL BE NO ROOM

170
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:50,102
FOR THEM, NO ONE WILL BE

171
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,039
LISTENING TO THEM IF HILLARY

172
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,274
CLINTON WINS.

173
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,643
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THEY

174
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,377
NEVER REALLY CARED ABOUT

175
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:04,750
DEFICITS.

176
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,419
EXCEPT WITH WHICH A STICK TO

177
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,254
BEAT PRESIDENT OBAMA.

178
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:13,659
IT IS ALL CAMPAIGN RHETORIC.

179
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,261
WHAT THEY DO BELIEVE IN OUR TAX

180
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,829
CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY, AND TRUMP

181
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,463
IS PROMISING THAT.

182
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:25,004
>> HAS HIS BACKGROUND, BUT HE'S

183
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:29,809
TRYING TO TARGET AMERICANS WHO

184
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:30,676
ARE LOOKING TO HIM TO BRING THEM

185
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:34,179
UP.

186
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,014
, CHIP THAT ECONOMIC MALAISE IN

187
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,381
THE U.S. IS CONTRIBUTING TO HIS

188
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:41,753
SUPPORT BASE?

189
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:46,359
-- HOW MUCH IS THAT ECONOMIC

190
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,226
MALAISE IN THE U.S. CONTRIBUTING

191
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:47,827
TO HIS SUPPORT BASE?

192
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,030
>> ECONOMIC ANXIETY IS NOT A

193
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:56,802
GOOD PREDICT OR OF WHO IS A

194
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,204
TRUMP SUPPORTER.

195
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:04,076
MAYBE IF THE COUNTRY WAS

196
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:04,810
LOOMING, WAGES RISING, AND

197
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,544
MANUFACTURING STRONG, ALL OF

198
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,813
THAT ANXIETY WOULD BE ON HOLD,

199
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,116
BUT I'M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THAT.

200
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,218
THE IDEA THAT THIS IS WHAT IT IS

201
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,085
ABOUT.

202
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:22,461
CHINA BASHING, TRADE, ALL OF

203
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,262
THESE SUBTERRANEAN AND PULSES

204
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,530
DRIVING THE REPUBLICAN VOTE ARE

205
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,264
NOW COMING TO THE SURFACE.

206
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:30,236
SCARLET: LET'S TALK ABOUT

207
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:30,803
HILLARY CLINTON.

208
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:31,570
YOU HAVE WRITTEN THAT HER VISION

209
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,440
IS NOTABLE FOR ITS LACK OF

210
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,343
OUTLANDISH ASSUMPTIONS.

211
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,445
SHE IS NOT JUSTIFYING HER

212
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:42,248
PROPOSALS THAT THEY WOULD CAUSE

213
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,650
A RADICAL QUICKENING OF THE U.S.

214
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,720
ECONOMY.

215
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,454
STRENGTHENING THE SOCIAL

216
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:52,224
SECURITY SAFETY NET BY TAXING

217
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,326
HIGH-INCOME EARNERS.

218
00:09:53,326 --> 00:10:01,167
>> IT IS CENTER-LEFT GOVERNANCE,

219
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,635
AN OBAMA THIRD TERM.

220
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,204
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE ORBIT

221
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:12,011
THINK THAT CLINTON-TYPE POLICY

222
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,712
WITH MORE INFRASTRUCTURE

223
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:14,446
SPENDING MIGHT HAVE A BIGGER

224
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:15,481
IMPACT ON GROWTH THAN SHE IS

225
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,683
WILLING TO ASSUME.

226
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,653
SHE IS ESSENTIALLY ASSUMING

227
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,387
NOTHING IN TERMS OF GROWTH

228
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,288
IMPACT, BUT THEY ARE NOT WILLING

229
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:26,759
TO BET THE FARM ON IT.

230
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,363
IT IS PARTLY A QUESTION OF

231
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:34,867
WHETHER WE WILL SEE MORE.

232
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,203
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT TAX

233
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,037
INCREASES AT THE TOP END, FAIRLY

234
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,772
SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONS TO

235
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:44,443
OBAMACARE, SO IT'S NOT THAT IT

236
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,744
IS MINOR, BUT IT IS A

237
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:47,113
CONTINUATION OF THE SAME KIND OF

238
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:47,880
GOVERNANCE WE HAVE HAD.

239
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:55,021
JOE: IS THE TIME FOR FISCAL

240
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:58,090
STIMULUS OVER?

241
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:04,029
>> 2-3 YEARS AGO, THE U.S.

242
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:07,500
ECONOMY WAS WELL BELOW CAPACITY.

243
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,837
THE FED WAS NOT THAT EFFECTIVE.

244
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,671
QUANTITATIVE EASING IS MARGINAL

245
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:13,906
TOOL AT BEST.

246
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,275
NOW THE ECONOMY MIGHT BE AT FULL

247
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,110
EMPLOYMENT, BUT WE DON'T KNOW

248
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,278
THAT.

249
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,681
SUPPOSE THERE IS TROUBLE IN

250
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,516
EUROPE OR CHINA.

251
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,619
SUPPOSE THERE ARE MORE PROBLEMS

252
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,488
OUT OF HOUSING.

253
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,891
WE HAVE VERY LITTLE ROOM TO

254
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:32,892
MANEUVER.

255
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,593
THE FED CAN'T DO MUCH MORE THAN

256
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:35,995
IT IS DOING.

257
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,932
FISCAL POLICY WOULD BE USEFUL AS

258
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,667
INSURANCE, AN ADDITIONAL SORT OF

259
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,568
DEMAND, AND WE KNOW IT CAN'T THE

260
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:46,839
STARTED ON SHORT NOTICE.

261
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,608
THERE IS A PRECAUTIONARY CASE

262
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:50,342
FOR BUSINESS STIMULUS RATHER

263
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,844
THAN WE NEED IT RIGHT NOW.

264
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:55,281
OF COURSE, WE CAN BORROW VERY

265
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:55,881
CHEAPLY AND WE NEED

266
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,382
INFRASTRUCTURE.

267
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,252
SCARLET: I WANT TO BRING IN

268
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,354
SOMETHING CARL ICAHN SAID.

269
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:08,694
>> I THINK TRUMP'S POLICIES ARE

270
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:09,628
POSSIBLY THE ONLY THING THAT

271
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:10,829
WILL SAVE US FROM GOING DOWN

272
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:13,165
THIS DECLINE WE ARE IN ON

273
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:13,666
PRODUCTIVITY.

274
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,636
SCARLET: THE LATEST PRODUCTIVITY

275
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,105
NUMBERS WERE DISAPPOINTING.

276
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:24,376
WHAT DO INVESTORS, BIG BUSINESS,

277
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,144
POLICYMAKERS MISUNDERSTAND THE

278
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:25,811
MOST ABOUT PRODUCTIVITY?

279
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:31,050
>> I'M NOT SURE THAT INVESTORS

280
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,851
MISUNDERSTAND, BUT I THINK WHAT

281
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:35,154
CARL ICAHN IS PRETENDING TO

282
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,422
MISUNDERSTAND IS THAT THE

283
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,189
PRESIDENT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH

284
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:37,523
THAT.

285
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,692
THE PRODUCTIVITY SLOWDOWN IS A

286
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,459
GLOBAL PHENOMENON.

287
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:46,332
WE ARE IN A LULL AND

288
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,601
TECHNOLOGY.

289
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,736
THERE IS NOTHING A PRESIDENT CAN

290
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:51,236
DO ABOUT THAT.

291
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:54,606
>> WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO

292
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:55,407
DISCERN IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF

293
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:58,510
MARKET REACTION TO A CLINTON OR

294
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,847
TRUMP PRESIDENCY, AND IT'S HARD

295
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:05,651
TO FIGURE OUT AT THIS POINT.

296
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,287
IT SHOULD INVESTORS BE

297
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,188
CONCERNED?

298
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,055
HOW ARE PEOPLE TRADING IN MAKING

299
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,857
MONEY AND MARKETS THE THINKING

300
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:12,291
ABOUT IT?

301
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,127
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WOULD

302
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,797
DO.

303
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,832
THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE HE

304
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,201
WOULD STAY IN THE BOUNDS OF

305
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:22,901
ANYBODY'S NOTION OF

306
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:25,137
RESPONSIBILITY.

307
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,038
ONE NUCLEAR WAR CAN SPOIL YOUR

308
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:30,442
WHOLE DAY.

309
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,276
NEVER MIND MY INVESTMENTS, HOW

310
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:31,777
ABOUT MY LIFE?

311
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,980
SCARLET: STICK WITH US.

312
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,483
WE WILL DISCUSS MORE AFTER THE

313
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,752
BREAK ON WHETHER IT IS TIME FOR

314
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:40,552
CENTRAL BANKS TO CHANGE COURSE

315
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:41,420
AND MOVE AWAY FROM THEIR CURRENT

316
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,489
MO.

317
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,123
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

318
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,124
♪

319
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:07,733
SCARLET: WE ARE HERE WITH PAUL

320
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,868
KRUGMAN.

321
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,804
WE HAVE THE FEDERAL RESERVE

322
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:16,842
THINKING ABOUT A RETHINK OF

323
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:20,179
MONETARY POLICY.

324
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,715
WHAT DOES THE FEDERAL RESERVE

325
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:24,850
KNOW WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT?

326
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:32,057
>> NOT MUCH.

327
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,160
THERE IS AN ACCUMULATION OF

328
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,994
EVIDENCE THAT MONETARY POLICY IS

329
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:36,562
PRETTY INEFFECTIVE.

330
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,697
WE CAME INTO THIS THINKING

331
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,700
MONETARY POLICY AT ZERO RATES

332
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,901
WAS INEFFECTIVE, THEN QE, THEN

333
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:47,306
NEGATIVE RATES, WHICH I HAVE TO

334
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,273
ADMIT I DID NOT THINK WAS

335
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,442
POSSIBLE, BUT IT IS NOT ACTUALLY

336
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,511
DOING VERY MUCH.

337
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,279
YOU HAVE NEGATIVE RATES IN

338
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,516
EUROPE AND THEY STILL CAN'T MOVE

339
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,016
INFLATION.

340
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,251
MASSIVE QE, HOW MUCH GOOD DID

341
00:16:59,251 --> 00:16:59,651
THAT DO?

342
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,154
SO IT LOOKS AS THOUGH WE ARE

343
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:07,826
GOING BACK TO SQUARE ONE.

344
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:08,660
IT WAS THAT THE ONLY THING YOU

345
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,497
COULD DO TO CREDIBLY PROMISE

346
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:18,503
HIGHER INFLATION, AND ONLY BY

347
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:21,440
CHANGING, CREATING THE

348
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,010
IMPRESSION OF A REGIME CHANGE

349
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,113
EVEN AFTER RECOVERY, THAT WAS HE

350
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,514
ONLY WAY MONETARY POLICY WAS

351
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:30,649
GOING TO GET TRACTION, AND WE

352
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,883
ARE MOST OF THE WAY BACK TO THAT

353
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:32,417
VIEW RIGHT NOW.

354
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:36,955
SCARLET: WAS THE PRESIDENT OF

355
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,123
THE SAN FRANCISCO FED CORRECT IN

356
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:38,824
SAYING WISHES AT HIGHER

357
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:39,424
INFLATION TARGETS.

358
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:43,829
>> I HAVE BEEN FOR THAT FOR A

359
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,731
WHILE.

360
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,967
I WENT TO THE ECB RESEARCH

361
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,270
CONFERENCE AND SAID THAT.

362
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,104
THEY WERE ALL POLITE AND IGNORED

363
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:56,241
ME.

364
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,011
THAT'S WHERE I CAME IN AND 19 98

365
00:17:59,011 --> 00:17:59,778
TALKING ABOUT JAPAN, THE SAME

366
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:00,112
THING.

367
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:04,016
JOE: WE GOT THIS NOTE FROM JOHN

368
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:07,586
WILLIAMS WHERE HE LAID OUT

369
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,123
POSSIBILITY FOR RETHINKING,

370
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:11,890
COMMITTED TO HIGHER INFLATION,

371
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:17,596
MORE AGGRESSIVE STABILIZERS, AND

372
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,363
WHEN I READ IT, I THOUGHT THIS

373
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,998
IS STUFF PEOPLE HAVE THEM

374
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:24,136
TALKING ABOUT FOR YEARS.

375
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:24,970
I GUESS THE REAL STORY IS THAT

376
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,804
IT'S COMING FROM SOMEONE SO

377
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:26,371
CENTRAL AT THE FED.

378
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:34,913

SYSTEM ON KEEPING TABS ON PILOTS

569
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:28,619

FEWER PEOPLE IN THE UNITED

00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,230

00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,306
THEY HAVE TO.

581
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:51,609

583
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,146

JOE: "WHAT'D YOU MISS?"

601
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:53,471
VOLATILITY IN THE YUAN HAS

602
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,073
DROPPED TO THE LOWEST LEVEL.

00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:59,544
ISVOLATILITY IN THAT NATION CENN

604
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,446
CONTROL?

GEORGE MAGNUS.

607
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,253
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

608
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:15,126
A YEAR LATER, IS CHINA'S

MONETARY POLICY AND CURRENCY

610
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,295
POLICY ON A MORE SOUND FOOTING?

611
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:23,167
>> IT IS ON AN EVEN KEEL

612
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:23,935
COMPARED WITH THIS TIME LAST

613
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,637
YEAR.

614
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,373
AT THE TURN OF THE YEAR, WE HAD

615
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:33,377
ANOTHER PERIOD OF PANIC FOR MUCH

616
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:37,448
THE SAME REASON IN DECEMBER AND

617
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:37,882
JANUARY.

618
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:41,619
THE PBOC INTRODUCED A BASKET,

619
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:46,024
TRYING TO MANAGE THE THE

620
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:46,857
CURRENCY, AND DECEMBER, CAPITAL

621
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:50,328
CONTROLS OF BEEN TIGHTENED, THE

622
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,729
ECONOMY IS LOOKING MORE STABLE

623
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,866
THANKS TO ROBUST STIMULUS

624
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:59,804
PROGRAM INTRODUCED, SO FOR THE

625
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:00,571
TIME BEING, THINGS CERTAINLY

626
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:13,317
LOOK MUCH MORE CALM.

627
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:19,790
MATT: ARE YOU OF THE OPINION

628
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,591
THAT WE SHOULD BE PAYING CLOSER

629
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:23,327
ATTENTION TO THE SIGNALING OF

630
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:26,864
THE UNDERLYING CHINESE ECONOMY

631
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:28,699
OR ARE THINGS THAT STRONG THAT

632
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,268
WE CAN MOVE ON AND MOVE PAST THE

633
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:30,768
DEPRECIATION?

634
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:35,473
>> MY FEELING IS THAT IF GLOBAL

635
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:41,279
MARKETS WERE GUILTY OF

636
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,446
OVERREACTING IN AUGUST LAST YEAR

637
00:34:42,446 --> 00:34:43,214
AND JANUARY THIS YEAR, THEN I

638
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,583
THINK AT THE MOMENT THAT THEY

639
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,020
ARE BEING A LITTLE COMPLACENT.

640
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,853
MAYBE MARKETS HAVE HAD JUST TOO

641
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:52,623
MANY THINGS TO THINK ABOUT, FED

642
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:59,797
POLICY, BREXIT.

643
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:06,804
THE REASONS THAT THINGS HAVE

644
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:13,611
CALMED IN THE CHINESE MARKET

645
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,147
IS BECAUSE OF AN EXTERNAL GROWTH

646
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:16,947
IN CREDIT AND A BIG FISCAL BOOST

647
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:18,015
WITH THE SHARE OF GOVERNMENT

648
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,083
SPENDING RISING THREE PERCENTAGE

649
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,519
POINTS OF GDP AND LAST 18

650
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,087
MONTHS.

651
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:27,892
A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING

652
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:28,693
, COMPENSATING FOR THE DECLINE

653
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,062
IN PRIVATE INVESTMENT FOR THE

654
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,764
FIRST TIME SINCE RECORDS BEGAN,

655
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:37,435
SO THE PROBLEM IS THAT THESE

656
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,169
THINGS WON'T BE ABLE TO

657
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:39,303
CONTINUE.

658
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,772
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WON'T BE

659
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:42,573
ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE THINGS.

660
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:48,379
THERE ARE SOME GREAT DISSENSIONS

661
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,480
GOING ON WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT

662
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,948
AS TO WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE

663
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:51,716
PURSUING THESE POLICIES IN THE

664
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:54,485
FIRST PLACE, SO MY HUNCH IS THAT

665
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,887
THINGS WILL START TO SLOW DOWN

666
00:35:56,887 --> 00:35:57,655
DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE

667
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,223
YEAR IN THE ECONOMY, AND THE

668
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,726
RENMINBI WILL WEAKEN AGAIN.

669
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:09,033
SCARLET: WHAT IS THE COST OF

670
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:09,800
CHINA MAINTAINING STABILITY AT

671
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,234
ALL COSTS?

672
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:16,073
>> THE COST IS THAT IN THE SHORT

673
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:17,708
RUN, WHICH IS TO SAY FOR THE

674
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,677
FORESEEABLE FUTURE, WE HAVE

675
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:24,549
EXACTLY THIS KIND OF SITUATION

676
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,383
WHERE NOBODY REALLY PAYS A HUGE

677
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,183
AMOUNT OF ATTENTION TO WHAT IS

678
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:30,521
GOING ON, BUT AS MOST ECONOMISTS

679
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,255
WOULD PROBABLY RECOGNIZE OR

680
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:34,091
CONCEDE, AND THE LONGER THE

681
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:38,429
CURRENCY AND POLICY STANCE

682
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,830
CONTINUES WITH CREDIT GROWING TO

683
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,031
TIMES OR THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT

684
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:45,202
OF NOMINAL GDP AND WITH FISCAL

685
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:47,371
STIMULUS AS WELL, THE BIGGER THE

686
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:54,645
BURDEN OF ADJUSTMENT AND THEIR

687
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:55,446
RISK OF A FINANCIAL INSTABILITY

688
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,481
IS GOING TO BE, PERHAPS AT A

689
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:58,315
TIME WHEN THE CHINESE WOULD NOT

690
00:36:58,315 --> 00:37:02,586
CHOOSE IT, AND THE YEAR WILL BE

691
00:37:02,586 --> 00:37:03,387
REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AT THE

692
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,190
END OF 2017, THE 19TH CONGRESS,

693
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:20,438
WHEN THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO PUT

694
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,740
IT BEFORE HIS PEOPLE.

695
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,343
THE LONGER YOU DON'T ROCK THE

696
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:26,177
BOAT, THE ROUGHER IT IS LIKELY

697
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,845
TO BECOME.

698
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,880
THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE SEEN

699
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,949
AND OUR OWN EXPERIENCE, AND

700
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:32,850
CHINA IS LOOKING TO BE HEADED IN

701
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,384
THE SAME WAY.

702
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:38,289
JOE: SOMETHING YOU SAID ABOUT

703
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,156
THE NARRATIVE ON CHINA STABILITY

704
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,226
GETTING STALE, THE CITY'S

705
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:46,363
ECONOMICS SURPRISE INDEX FOR

706
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:47,164
CHINA TOOK A SHARP LEG DOWN

707
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:48,732
AFTER MEDIOCRE RETAIL SALES,

708
00:37:48,732 --> 00:37:54,905
FIXED ASSETS, SO WE ARE ALREADY

709
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,241
SEEING THE INABILITY FOR CHINA

710
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:57,942
TO HOLD UP THAT CREDIT AND

711
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,678
FISCAL DRIVEN STABILITY THAT WAS

712
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:01,445
A STORY FOR THE FIRST HALF OF

713
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:01,846
THE YEAR?

714
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:05,483
>> YES, THAT IS RIGHT.

715
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,152
THE SECONDARY STORY AWAY FROM

716
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:12,423
THE HEADLINES IS THAT THE MORE

717
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,426
THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO SEVCON

718
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:23,501
-- SIR, CENTCOM

719
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:27,238
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO NEXT

720
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:27,638
TIME?

721
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,906
WILL THEY INCREASE FISCAL

722
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:29,740
SPENDING FURTHER, CUT INTEREST

723
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,709
RATES AT A TIME WHEN THE ECONOMY

724
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,711
DOES NOT NEED IT?

725
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:34,512
ARE THEY GOING TO ALLOW CREDIT

726
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:39,583
TO GROW?

727
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:40,384
THESE ARE ISSUES WHICH WERE

728
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:46,790
RAISED BY A SO-CALLED AUTHORITY

729
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:47,491
OF SOURCE THAT EVERYBODY

730
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,192
UNDERSTANDS AS CLOSE TO THE

731
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,327
PRESIDENT IN MAY, AND NOTHING

732
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:54,898
HAS HAPPENED.

733
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:56,801
THIS IS THE ISSUE REALLY.

734
00:38:56,801 --> 00:39:01,072
IT IS JUST NOT SUSTAINABLE, AND

735
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:01,906
THE LONGER THE GOVERNMENT TRIES

736
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,742
TO STICK TO THIS OLD MODEL OF

737
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,043
KEEPING THE ECONOMY GOING AT ANY

738
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:11,382
COSTS, SUBSCRIBING TO THE 6.5%

739
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,917
TO 7% GDP TARGET, THE MORE

740
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:16,020
DAMAGING IT IS LIKELY TO BECOME.

741
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,290
IF WE COULD ONLY PREDICT WITH

742
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,124
CERTAINTY THAT IT HAS A LIFESPAN

743
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,792
OF THREE MONTH'S OR FOUR MONTHS,

744
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:22,793
THAT WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER AS

745
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,361
AN INVESTOR, BUT YOU CAN'T DO

746
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,197
THAT.

747
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,831
IT IS LIABLE TO ERUPT AT SOME

748
00:39:27,831 --> 00:39:30,601
POINT AND COULD BE WITHIN THREE

749
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:31,435
MONTH'S OR 13 MONTHS, VERY

750
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:31,969
DIFFICULT TO SAY.

751
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,438
SCARLET: IT IS KICKING THE CAN

752

AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN

830
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:46,416
NOW BECAUSE THERESA MAY HAS SAID

831
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:49,086
IT WILL NOT BE UNTIL SOMETIME IN

DISCUSSIONS GOING ON WITH THE

835
00:44:58,428 --> 00:44:59,897
GOVERNMENT OF SCOTLAND,

836
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:00,697
GOVERNMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND,

837
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:01,765
THE GERMANS AND FRENCH HAVE

838
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:05,736
ELECTIONS IN 2017 IN MARCH AND

839
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,572
SEPTEMBER, SO THERE IS A

840
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:10,741
SPORTING CHANCE THAT THE

841
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:11,575
NEGOTIATIONS WON'T GET GOING

842
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:13,310

843
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,544
AND MAYBE NOT UNTIL THE END OF

844
00:45:14,544 --> 00:45:18,815

845
00:45:18,815 --> 00:45:19,616

846
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:22,719
LITTLE BIT MORE NOW.

847
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:23,520
ARGUABLY THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE

848
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,922
SO BEFORE THE REFERENDUM TOOK

849
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,823
LACE, BUT PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING

850
00:45:26,823 --> 00:45:27,791
TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT HOW IN NORMS

851
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,160
THE COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING

852
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,129

859
00:45:45,575 --> 00:45:48,578

860
00:45:48,578 --> 00:45:53,850
RISK ASSETS DOING WELL, IS THERE

861
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:54,685
A CHANCE HERE THAT PERHAPS THERE

862
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:55,452
WILL BE A CERTAIN POINT THAT WE

863
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:58,655
CAN SAY THE DATA IS NOT CROPPING

864
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,824
UP YET AND MAY BE THE FALLOUT IS

865
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:01,525
NOT AS BAD AS WE EXPECTED?

866
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:04,761
>> THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION, AND

867
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:13,036
IT HAS AN A AND B ANSWER.

868
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:19,543
A, THE VOTE AFFECTS THE

869
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:20,377
POTENTIAL LEVEL OF DEMAND IN THE

870
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:21,278
ECONOMY.

871
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,113
WE HAVE NOT HAD ANYTHING OTHER

872
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,182
THAN ANECDOTE ABOUT WHAT IS

873
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:29,953
GOING ON IN THE REAL ECONOMY,

874
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:32,556
AND IT IS ONLY A MONTHS WORTH OF

875
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:33,457
DATA, SO WE WON'T GET A REAL

876
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:37,761
FEEL FOR THIS UNTIL OCTOBER.

877
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:38,462
THE DOE CONCERN IN THE

878
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,130
GOVERNMENT'S CONCERN HERE IS

879
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,200
THAT WE COULD GET TIPPED INTO A

880
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,202
RECESSION IF INVESTMENT SPENDING

881
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:50,107
AND EMPLOYMENT HIRES, IF THESE

882
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,743
THINGS DRY UP, THEN WE WILL GO

883
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:53,243
OVER THE EDGE.

884
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:53,877
THAT IS A POSSIBILITY.

885
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:57,614
IT IS BY NO MEANS A SHOE IN.

886
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,483
I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH THIS OR

887
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,484
SAY THAT IT IS NOT IMPORTANT,

888
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,253
BUT IF WE DID HAVE A RECESSION,

889
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,422
IT WOULD NOT BE A 2008-2009 KIND

890
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:10,260
OF DOWNTURN, BECAUSE THE BANKING

891
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,094
SYSTEM IS FUNDAMENTALLY OK, SO

892
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:11,762
WE WERE NOT HAVE CREDIT

893
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:16,600
RECESSION, THAT KIND OF

894
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,401
DOWNTURN, AND WE WOULD RECOVER

895
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,235
FROM A BUSINESS DOWNTURN WITHIN

896
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:20,838
A REASONABLE TIME.

897
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:27,678
THE B IN MY VIEW IS MUCH MORE

898
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,478
IMPORTANT, THE ECONOMY'S

899
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:29,279
POTENTIAL TO GROW OVER THE NEXT

900
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,280
5-10 YEARS.

901
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,116
IF WE SCREW UP AND MAKE A MESS

902
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:40,257
OF TRADE AND INVESTMENT, BOTH

903
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,024
BRITISH COMPANIES AND FOREIGN

904
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:44,127
COMPANIES THAT WANT TO SET UP IN

905
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,196
THE U.K., IF WE RESTRICT THE

906
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:49,166
IMPORTED SKILLED LABOR, THESE

907
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:51,802
ARE THE THINGS THAT WILL REALLY

908
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,503
IMPACT THE BRITISH ECONOMY'S

909
00:47:53,503 --> 00:48:02,679
ABILITY TO GROW SATISFACTORILY,

910
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:03,780
AND THAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE

911
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,582
DANGEROUS THAN SIX MONTHS OF A

912
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:06,016
RECESSION.

913
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:13,657
JOE: SOME OF THE PRO-BREXIT

914
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:14,491
CAMPAIGNERS SAID IT IS OK IF WE

915
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:18,428
LEAVE OF THE COMMON MARKET

916
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:19,162
BECAUSE COUNTRIES WILL BE

917
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:23,433
BEATING DOWN OUR DOOR AND WE

918
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:24,234
WILL SIGN ALL THESE BILATERAL

919
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,035
TRADE AS WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO

920
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,903
SIGN WHEN WE WERE PART OF THE

921
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:29,239
EU.

922
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,575
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE U.K.

923
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,342
TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

924
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,311
REST OF THE WORLD WILL LOOK LIKE

925
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:35,245
AFTER IT LEAVES THE EU?

926
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:46,390
>> I THINK THAT IS ALL DILUDED.

927
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,159
SOME PEOPLE HAVE THE IDEA THAT

928
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:49,926
THE WORLD IS A WONDERFUL PLACE

929
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:53,897
TO DO BUSINESS AND TRADE,

930
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:54,698
SEVERAL BRITISH MINISTERS AND

931
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:55,732
POLITICIANS HAVE SAID THE WORLD

932
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:56,466
IS LINING UP TO DO TRADE DEALS

933
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:58,535
WITH BRITAIN, BUT THE REALITY IS

934
00:48:58,535 --> 00:48:59,536
QUITE DIFFERENT.

935
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:05,308
IT IS IN A FUNK, AND WORLD

936
00:49:05,308 --> 00:49:06,676
EXPORT CLAIMS ARE 15% BELOW THE

937
00:49:06,676 --> 00:49:10,780
TREND LINE WE WOULD HAVE SEEN IF

938
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,515
THE FINANCIAL CRISIS HAD NOT

939
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:11,982
HAPPENED.

940
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,884
THAT IS NUMBER ONE.

941
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:16,019
NUMBER TWO, IS PROTECTIONISM IS

942
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:16,820
RISING IN WAYS THAT MOST PEOPLE

943
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:19,122
DON'T SEE, AND THE REASON THEY

944
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,158
DON'T SEE IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF

945
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:21,925
TERRORISTS, BUT BECAUSE OF

946
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:28,231
NON-TARIFF BARRIERS THAT IS

947
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:28,999
GATHERING MOMENTUM THROUGHOUT

948
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:30,901
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

949
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:33,236
MOST OF THE PERPETRATORS ARE

950
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,371
G-20 ECONOMIES THAT WE WANT TO

951
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,272
DO OUR TRADING WITH.

952
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,007
THE THIRD THING IS THAT THE

953
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:39,409
BRITISH ECONOMY DEPENDS A LOT ON

954
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,210
SERVICES EXPORTS.

955
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:45,382
WE SELL MOST OF OUR SERVICES TO

956
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,149

957
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,151

958
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,220

00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,521
SERVICES TO THE CHINESE COME THE

960
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:54,191
INDIANS, AND EMERGING COUNTRIES.

961
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:56,259
IF THESE NONTARIFF BARRIERS COME

962
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:57,227
INTO EFFECT, THEY WILL BE A BIG

963
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:57,727

1033
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,643
THE CHAIRMAN WOULD DO THAT

1034
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:42,479
UNLESS HE ENDORSED PAUL RYAN,

1035
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:46,015

1037
