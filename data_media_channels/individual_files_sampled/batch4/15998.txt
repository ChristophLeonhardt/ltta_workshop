this just in Maclean's magazine is now officially a shameless propaganda organ for the Trudeau liberals and it's all about the money honey your money check out the November issue of McLane's how unfortunate that the National Magazine Awards doesn't dole out a trophy for most embarrassing cover because this one would win hands down for starters there's the bright yellow cover line announcing you're welcome Canada it's right next to a photo of Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland sporting her trademark creepy cat that ate the canary grin the deck goes on to note quote like it or not Chrystia Freeland just saved the country from economic catastrophe how she did it and what comes next for ottawa's newest political superstar end quote gee how did the McLane's art director forget the Photoshop a Supergirl costume on Freeland what unfolds between the covers as a slobbering love affair regarding the myriad merits of Freeland as she went toe-to-toe against her bullying opponent it's supposed to be a factual feature but writer John Getty seems to evoke the persona of a smitten fanboy penning a love letter to miss Freeland lurid prose that wouldn't be too out of place if it had been published in Penthouse Forum indeed at one point Geddes lustfully notes freelance choice of apparel and accessories writing quote after Trudeau's colorful socks her sheath dresses and pearls became the most recognizable signature attire in federal politics end quote yikes get a room already Geddes goes on to fawn over free lands wealth her education her former career as a journalist eventually noting quote none of that would ingratiate her to Trump's crew indeed Freeland exemplifies the liberal mobile elite Trump was elected to displace consider the contrast with his trades our US Trade Representative Robert light Heiser 70 is a gruff old guard Republican who served in Ronald Reagan's administration in the 1980s end quote oh like ooh the US version of Freeland is this old white male chauvinist pig who has ties to gasp Reaganomics oh those poor Yanks they must be so jealous they don't have a brainy hip milf like Freeland negotiating their trade deals do they now Gettys wraps up his piece with yet more unintentionally funny prose quote NAFTA has now survived the threat Trump represents and Freeland has risen as a result her next moves and she's shown a propensity to keep moving will be among the most closely watched in Canadian politics end quote um I was the cheerleader get he's able to pound out such pithy prose on his keyboard given that he surely has read liberal pom-poms affixed to his wrists by the way if you want a counterpoint to the MacLaine's propaganda piece please check out the column by Pierre Paul aver that appeared in the Toronto Sun earlier this week entitled Trudeau gets trumped polar bear is a the Conservatives financial critic and he correctly notes that Canada got nothing out of the trade deal that we didn't already have in fact US tariffs remain on softwood lumber while by American policies shut out Canadian companies from state and municipal projects worse there are now new tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum as for our disastrous energy file Paulo ver notes that even former New Brunswick liberal premier Frank McKenna called the new Natha deal a quote glorious day for Donald Trump who won an endless supply of Canadian oil for decades to come at a deeply discounted price and a transfer of wealth from Canada end quote let's see that Maclean's headline again you're welcome Canada really so the question arises what's the motivation for such shameless propaganda well it's the almighty dollar of course MacLaine's gets about two million dollars annually from the federal government and it wants more it needs more fiscally speaking MacLaine's is a dog a dog with fleas its frequency was recently reduced from 52 issues per year to just 12 and its owner Rogers has been trying to sell it for months now without success can you blame the reluctance of potential buyers to be in the black a magazine should have at least 60% advertising pages versus 40% editorial but look at the May issue of MacLaine's which is a typical edition of its 76 pages only 12 are ad pages and one of those is for an ad for a rogers product which means it was a freebie gulp McLane's is increasingly desperate for taxpayer-funded welfare to stay afloat that means not biting the hand that feeds capisce that means sucking up to the Trudeau Liberals with puff pieces that means appointing skug Gilliam or the househusband of Environment Minister Catherine McKenna as an editor at large yeah that's right way to keep it in the family guys bottom line that headline shouldn't read you're welcome Canada it should read thanks a million suckers for the rebel daunt media I'm David des men's ID Menzies hey folks the rebel has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
