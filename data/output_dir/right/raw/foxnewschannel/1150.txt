1
00:00:00,461 --> 00:00:02,296
IN A FEW MINUTES PAMELA ANDERSON

2
00:00:02,296 --> 00:00:04,599
JOINS US TONIGHT, AND TELLS US

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:07,068
ABOUT HER VISIT TO THE KREMLIN

4
00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:07,668
RECENTLY.

5
00:00:07,668 --> 00:00:09,904
BUT FIRST TONIGHT, YOU PROBABLY

6
00:00:09,904 --> 00:00:11,105
HEARD THAT MELANIA TRUMP HAD A

7
00:00:11,105 --> 00:00:12,273
KIDNEY OPERATION LAST MONTH,

8
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:14,909
THAT KIND OF THING HAPPENS TO

9
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:16,510
40-YEAR-OLDS, EVEN FAMOUS ONES.

10
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,112
SHE TOOK A FEW WEEKS TO RECOVER,

11
00:00:18,112 --> 00:00:19,814
STAYED OFF TV AND DIDN'T GIVE

12
00:00:19,814 --> 00:00:21,716
ANY SPEECHES, CULPRIT IS

13
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:24,752
DIFFICULT FOR SOMEONE WHO JUST

14
00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:26,721
GOT OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.

15
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:28,289
BUT AT CNN, THEY ARE PROUD

16
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:29,390
JOURNALISTS AND IF THERE'S ONE

17
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,125
THING THEY KNEW FOR CERTAIN, ONE

18
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,895
THING THAT WAS DRUMMED INTO THEM

19
00:00:34,895 --> 00:00:35,963
IS THAT REPUBLICAN FIRST LADIES

20
00:00:35,963 --> 00:00:38,466
LIE A LOT AND ARE EVIL AND FOR

21
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:40,668
THE SAKE OF CIVILIZATION SHOULD

22
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:41,102
BE DESTROYED.

23
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:43,070
SO CNN DID NOT BUY A WORD OF

24
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,473
THAT AND THEY ASSIGNED THEIR

25
00:00:45,473 --> 00:00:47,842
MOST DOGGED JOURNALIST TO CRACK

26
00:00:47,842 --> 00:00:48,476
THE CASE, THE SQUEAK AND

27
00:00:48,476 --> 00:00:52,013
PERSISTENT BRIAN STELTER.

28
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:53,481
HE UNDERSTOOD IMMEDIATELY THAT

29
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:54,882
THE WHOLE KIDNEY OPERATION STORY

30
00:00:54,882 --> 00:00:56,817
WAS JUST A COVER FOR SOMETHING

31
00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:59,654
DARKER AND MORE SINISTER, LIKELY

32
00:00:59,654 --> 00:01:01,222
IN OTHER INTERNATIONAL SCANDAL

33
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:03,057
EMANATING FROM THAT DARK LORD

34
00:01:03,057 --> 00:01:03,824
VLADIMIR PUTIN HIMSELF.

35
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:07,728
HE ENDED AS MUCH HIS VIEWERS.

36
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:09,063
>> ONE THING THE PRESIDENT OF

37
00:01:09,063 --> 00:01:12,133
THE WHITE HOUSE HAVE BEEN QUIET

38
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:13,200
ABOUT IS MELANIA TRUMP AND HER

39
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:14,669
LAST TIME I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF

40
00:01:14,669 --> 00:01:17,138
HER WAS ON MAY 10TH, 24 DAYS AND

41
00:01:17,138 --> 00:01:18,406
MORE THAN THREE WEEKS.

42
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:20,007
THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT

43
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:24,178
HER SURGERY, HER TIME AT WALTER

44
00:01:24,178 --> 00:01:26,881
REED AND NOW HER INVISIBILITY.

45
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:28,749
>> Tucker: QUESTIONS ABOUT HER

46
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:30,084
SURGERY, QUESTIONS ABOUT HER

47
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:32,486
TIME AT WALTER REED?

48
00:01:32,486 --> 00:01:33,954
WHO IS ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS?

49
00:01:33,954 --> 00:01:35,289
HE DIDN'T SAY BECAUSE HE

50
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:36,290
COULDN'T SAY.

51
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,692
THOSE ARE NOT REAL QUESTIONS AND

52
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:40,494
THIS IS NOT REPORTING, IF THE

53
00:01:40,494 --> 00:01:41,128
PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE ATTACK.

54
00:01:41,128 --> 00:01:42,630
THE CNN POINT WAS THAT MELANIA

55
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,499
TRUMP IS A LIAR AND SHE'S DOING

56
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:46,100
SOMETHING IMMORAL.

57
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,769
SHE MUST BE, LOOK WHO SHE IS

58
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:49,503
MARRIED TO.

59
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:50,638
STEPHEN COLBERT CAME TO THE SAME

60
00:01:50,638 --> 00:01:53,040
CONCLUSION, WATCH.

61
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,376
>> AS OF THE TIME WE ARE TAPING

62
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:56,177
THE SHOW, THE FIRST LADY HAS NOT

63
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:59,313
BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC FOR 25 DAYS.

64
00:01:59,313 --> 00:02:02,616
I'M NOT SURPRISED, I TOOK THAT

65
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:03,417
SHAWSHANK GUY YEARS TO TUMBLE

66
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:04,952
OUT.

67
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:08,055
MONIA IS SUPPOSEDLY REEMERGING

68
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:09,090
TO ATTEND AN EVENT AND IT WILL

69
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,691
BE CLOSE TO THE PRESS.

70
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:13,794
BUT THE WHITE HOUSE DID RELEASE

71
00:02:13,794 --> 00:02:17,465
THE OFFICIAL PHOTO PROVING THE

72
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:18,332
FIRST LADY WAS TOTALLY THERE.

73
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:20,468
>> Tucker: OVER AT

74
00:02:20,468 --> 00:02:21,202
ROLLING STONE WHICH APPARENTLY

75
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:22,737
STILL EXISTS SOMEONE CALLED

76
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:23,938
JAMIL SMITH SAID MELANIA TRUMP

77
00:02:23,938 --> 00:02:26,440
WASN'T HIDING TO CONCEAL SIGNS

78
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,275
OF PHYSICAL ABUSE.

79
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:29,577
THEY THEN SUGGESTED THAT THE

80
00:02:29,577 --> 00:02:31,178
PRESIDENT MAY HAVE PUNCHED MY

81
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:33,514
MONIA AND THEN ORDERED THE

82
00:02:33,514 --> 00:02:35,483
SECRET SERVICE TO COVER IT UP.

83
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:38,319
KEEP IN MIND THAT AT ONE TIME HE

84
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,521
WAS A SERIOUS INTELLECTUAL, OR

85
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:41,689
WHAT PASSED FOR ONE IN

86
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:42,089
WASHINGTON.

87
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:45,526
AND NOW HE IS SIMPLY A BUFFOON.

88
00:02:45,526 --> 00:02:46,293
AND WHEN THE ACTUAL MELANIA

89
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:49,130
TRUMP SHOWED UP AT A VETERANS

90
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,498
EVENT, VERY MUCH ALIVE AND

91
00:02:50,498 --> 00:02:52,099
UNSCATHED, SO MUCH FOR ALL THOSE

92
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:53,801
QUESTIONS THAT BRIAN STELTER

93
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:54,802
PRETENDED TO CARE ABOUT.

94
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:58,906
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS

95
00:02:58,906 --> 00:03:01,375
HOW MUCH JOURNALISTS PRETEND TO

96
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:01,909
HATE MELANIA TRUMP.

97
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:03,511
MELANIA TRUMP IS NOT AN

98
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:04,678
OVERBEARING PUBLIC FIGURE.

99
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:06,313
SHE'S NOT LECTURING YOU ABOUT

100
00:03:06,313 --> 00:03:08,115
YOUR WEIGHT OR TRYING TO CONTROL

101
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:08,916
YOUR PERSONAL LIFE.

102
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,418
SHE DOESN'T WEIGH IN ON TAX

103
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:12,119
RATES OR GLOBAL WARMING.

104
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:13,921
IT'S LIKELY SHE WILL RUN FOR

105
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:14,955
SENATE IN NEW YORK WHEN THIS IS

106
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:15,322
OVER.

107
00:03:15,322 --> 00:03:18,559
ONE THING SHE IS ONE OF HER

108
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:20,161
HUSBAND'S KEY POLITICAL

109
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:20,528
ADVISORS.

110
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:22,062
MANY OF YOU HAVE NOT EVEN HEARD

111
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:24,598
HER VOICE, SHE DOESN'T TALK MUCH

112
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:24,965
IN PUBLIC.

113
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:25,900
MELANIA TRUMP HAS DONE NOTHING

114
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,536
WRONG TO YOU, ANYONE YOU KNOW OR

115
00:03:28,536 --> 00:03:30,304
ANYONE YOU WILL EVER MEET.

116
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:31,539
SHE MARRIED DONALD TRUMP, AND

117
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:33,374
THAT IS HER ONLY SIN IN THE EYES

118
00:03:33,374 --> 00:03:35,709
OF THE PRESS CORPS AND IT'S

119
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:37,912
ENOUGH TO DISQUALIFY HER FROM

120
00:03:37,912 --> 00:03:40,114
EVEN THE MOST BASIC

121
00:03:40,114 --> 00:03:40,748
CONSIDERATION OF DECENCY.

122
00:03:40,748 --> 00:03:41,816
HERE FOR EXAMPLE IS SUPER

123
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:43,150
SENSITIVE MODERN COMEDIAN GUY AT

124
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,652
JIMMY KIMMEL MAKING FUN OF HER

125
00:03:44,652 --> 00:03:47,321
ACCENT WHICH HE THINKS IS SILLY

126
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:50,724
AND FUNNY SOUNDING, ALIEN,

127
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:52,893
REALLY.

128
00:03:52,893 --> 00:03:55,396
>> I'M CURIOUS, JUST LIKE A CAT.

129
00:03:55,396 --> 00:03:57,298
I ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT

130
00:03:57,298 --> 00:04:04,238
THIS AND OF THAT.

131
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:04,605
[LAUGHTER]

132
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:06,540
>> Tucker: DO YOU THINK KIMMEL

133
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,211
WOULD BE OKAY MOCKING THE ACCENT

134
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:11,879
OF HIS MANY GUATEMALAN

135
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,880
HOUSEKEEPERS?

136
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,482
WHAT ABOUT AN MS-13 MEMBER?

137
00:04:14,482 --> 00:04:17,117
PLEASE COME UP THAT WOULD BE

138
00:04:17,117 --> 00:04:17,451
RACIST.

139
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:20,488
BUT MELANIA TRUMP?

140
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:24,291
AT ONE TIME PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE

141
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,693
THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE JUDGED FOR

142
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:27,094
WHAT THEY DO.

143
00:04:27,094 --> 00:04:28,863
COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT IS WRONG,

144
00:04:28,863 --> 00:04:29,897
IT IS IMMORAL.

145
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:31,499
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID.

146
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:33,200
DID THEY EVER REALLY BELIEVE

147
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,268
THAT?

148
00:04:34,268 --> 00:04:35,803
WHO KNOWS, BUT THEY DON'T

149
00:04:35,803 --> 00:04:39,840
BELIEVE IT NOW.

150
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,475
TAMMY, WHAT DO YOU MAKE -- JUST

151
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:44,979
TO BE TOTALLY CLEAR, I NEVER

152
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:46,514
TYPICALLY DEFENDED THE HONOR OF

153
00:04:46,514 --> 00:04:47,281
POLITICIANS.

154
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:49,583
IN FACT, THERE IS A ROLE I

155
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,117
DON'T.

156
00:04:50,117 --> 00:04:51,986
BUT MELANIA TRUMP IS NOT A

157
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:52,820
POLITICIAN, WHY ARE THEY

158
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,687
ATTACKING HER?

159
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:55,155
WHAT DOES SHE HAVE TO DO WITH

160
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:55,689
IT?

161
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:57,992
>> IN LARGE PART IT'S BECAUSE

162
00:04:57,992 --> 00:04:59,126
THEY'RE JEALOUS AND ENVIOUS.

163
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:01,929
HERE, YOU HAVE A WOMAN WHO HAS

164
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:03,464
POWER, INFLUENCE, SHE'S

165
00:05:03,464 --> 00:05:04,732
PERFECTLY LOVELY, SHE'S SMART

166
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:08,302
AND SPEAKS FIVE LANGUAGES.

167
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:09,937
YES, SHE MARRIED A MAN THAT THEY

168
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:11,438
DON'T LIKE BUT SHE HAS ACCESS TO

169
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:13,841
THINGS THAT THEY CAN NOW DO NOT

170
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:14,842
HAVE ACCESS TO.

171
00:05:14,842 --> 00:05:16,877
THEY USED TO BE THE ONES THAT

172
00:05:16,877 --> 00:05:20,147
WERE FAWNED OVER, WHO WOULD BE

173
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:22,816
LOOKED TO FOR POWER AND

174
00:05:22,816 --> 00:05:23,684
APPOINTMENT AND CREDIBILITY.

175
00:05:23,684 --> 00:05:26,086
NOW, AS A WOMAN WHO NEVER REALLY

176
00:05:26,086 --> 00:05:28,122
CARES ABOUT THEM AND HAS GONE TO

177
00:05:28,122 --> 00:05:30,491
CERTAINLY SOME COCKTAIL PARTIES

178
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:32,960
BUT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT WHAT THE

179
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,562
ELITES IN WASHINGTON NECESSARILY

180
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:34,895
THINGS.

181
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:37,464
SHE CARES ABOUT HER SON, HER

182
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:40,100
FAMILY, AND HER PARENTS AND THAT

183
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,535
IS HER CRIME AS WELL.

184
00:05:41,535 --> 00:05:44,104
KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS FOR EVERY

185
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:46,507
WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN DARED TO BE

186
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:47,908
PART OF THIS ADMINISTRATION.

187
00:05:47,908 --> 00:05:49,710
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

188
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,079
HYPOCRISY OF THE LEFT, IT IS THE

189
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,883
ATTACKS ON THESE WOMEN THAT ARE

190
00:05:55,883 --> 00:05:56,317
MISOGYNISTIC.

191
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:58,285
WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT EITHER

192
00:05:58,285 --> 00:06:00,688
BEING BEATEN BY THE PRESIDENT OR

193
00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:04,491
HIDING IN WALTER REED, OR HAVING

194
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:05,960
TO SECRETE HERSELF AWAY, IT

195
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,195
PRESUMES THAT SHE IS A VICTIM,

196
00:06:08,195 --> 00:06:10,598
THAT SHE IS HELPLESS, THAT SHE

197
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:12,132
IS NOT WILLING TO TAKE CARE OF

198
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:13,500
HER OWN LIFE.

199
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,069
THAT KIND OF MISOGYNY IS AN

200
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:16,604
INSULT NOT JUST TO THE

201
00:06:16,604 --> 00:06:20,107
FIRST LADY BUT FOR WOMEN WHO DO

202
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:20,708
EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE AND

203
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,208
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

204
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,509
AND YET THESE ARE THE PEOPLE

205
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:23,978
THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

206
00:06:23,978 --> 00:06:24,545
CHAMPIONS FOR WOMEN.

207
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:28,515
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT

208
00:06:28,515 --> 00:06:29,149
THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE

209
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:30,951
CHAMPIONS THAT COME FROM THE

210
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:32,252
CENTER RIGHT ARGUMENT, THAT

211
00:06:32,252 --> 00:06:33,354
WOMEN ARE INDIVIDUALS, THAT THEY

212
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:35,155
ARE SMART IN THE FIRST LADY IS

213
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:37,024
AN EXAMPLE OF A POWERFUL WOMAN

214
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:40,894
LIVING A LIFE THAT BEST SUITS

215
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:41,795
HER, AND SHE SHOULD BE LAUDED

216
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:42,997
FOR THAT.

217
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:44,365
>> Tucker: SHE NEVER BOTHERED

218
00:06:44,365 --> 00:06:44,765
ANYBODY.

219
00:06:44,765 --> 00:06:50,004
I'M TRYING TO IMAGINE A

220
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:51,171
CONVERSATION WHERE JEFF ZUCKER

221
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:53,007
BECAUSE OF HIS ERRAND BOY AND

222
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:54,575
SAYS, IT'S TIME TO ATTACK HER.

223
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:58,512
AND I'M THINKING, IF YOU REALLY

224
00:06:58,512 --> 00:07:00,848
THINK THAT IT IS APPEALING TO

225
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:11,525
ATTACK MELANIA TRUMP, AND, SHE

226
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:14,728
IS AT 57% FAVORABLE.

227
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:16,463
SHE HAD A MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE

228
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:19,133
OF MEN THAT WERE FAVORABLE TO

229
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:20,701
HER, BUT THAT MEANS YOU DON'T

230
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:21,735
WANT TO TALK MILLENIA BECAUSE

231
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:23,303
YOU ARE IN ATTACKING THE VOTERS

232
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:24,505
THAT YOU NEED.

233
00:07:24,505 --> 00:07:27,107
THEY PROBABLY SEE THIS AS A

234
00:07:27,107 --> 00:07:30,744
WRONG IDEA BECAUSE NO ONE USES

235
00:07:30,744 --> 00:07:31,445
SILENCE BETTER THAN MELANIA

236
00:07:31,445 --> 00:07:31,745
TRUMP.

237
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:34,281
THAT SILENCE THAT YOU SEE NOW

238
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:35,149
HAS ALL OF AMERICA WAITING TO

239
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:37,284
TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN SHE

240
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:37,918
REAPPEARS ON THE SCENE.

241
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,154
SO POLITICALLY GIVEN HER

242
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:44,058
RATINGS, IT'S NOT A VERY SMART

243
00:07:44,058 --> 00:07:45,526
THING FOR A COLUMNIST TO DO

244
00:07:45,526 --> 00:07:45,826
THIS.

245
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:48,662
>> HE RAN THE POLITICAL

246
00:07:48,662 --> 00:07:50,297
OPERATIONS AT THE WHITE HOUSE,

247
00:07:50,297 --> 00:07:53,133
AND YOU USED DATA TO DO THAT.

248
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:54,902
WHEN PEOPLE BECOME SO EMOTIONAL

249
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:56,336
AND WHEN A POLITICAL CAUSE

250
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:57,705
BECOMES A MORAL CAUSE, IT'S

251
00:07:57,705 --> 00:07:59,740
PRETTY HARD TO MAKE RATIONAL

252
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,608
DECISIONS, ISN'T IT?

253
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:03,143
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

254
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:05,345
A LOT OF WHAT WE SEE TODAY IS

255
00:08:05,345 --> 00:08:06,914
GETTING BACK TO RATIONALITY IN

256
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:07,681
OUR POLITICS.

257
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:09,516
NOW HILLARY CLINTON AS

258
00:08:09,516 --> 00:08:10,184
FIRST LADY ENDURED A LOT OF

259
00:08:10,184 --> 00:08:13,087
ATTACKS WHEN SHE WENT INTO

260
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:13,921
HEALTH CARE AND CONTROVERSIAL

261
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:14,521
ISSUES.

262
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:17,491
BUT, IT TAKES A VILLAGE, THE

263
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:17,958
COUNTRY UNITED.

264
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,426
MELANIA TRUMP IS NOT IN

265
00:08:19,426 --> 00:08:20,761
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES, SHE'S

266
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:22,963
TRYING TO HELP KIDS.

267
00:08:22,963 --> 00:08:23,664
SHE'S DOING THOSE THINGS THAT

268
00:08:23,664 --> 00:08:27,668
THE COUNTRY CAN AGREED UPON.

269
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:31,505
>> THE WAY THAT THE LEFT HAS

270
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:35,775
FRAMED EVERYTHING IS A MORAL

271
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:36,477
DIVIDE.

272
00:08:36,477 --> 00:08:37,778
NOTHING ABOUT TRUMP CAN BE GOOD

273
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:41,181
AND EVERYTHING THAT IS A

274
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:53,460
CONSTRUCT CAN BE GOOD.

275
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:54,294
CONSTRUCT CAN BE GOOD.

276
00:08:54,294 --> 00:08:55,696
AND, THAT'S FINE, LET'S DEAL

277
00:08:55,696 --> 00:08:56,697
WITH POLICY ISSUES.

278
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:59,199
BUT REMEMBER THE ATTACKS ON THE

279
00:08:59,199 --> 00:08:59,833
FIRST LADY I WOULD CONTEND

280
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,502
BECAUSE THE ATTACKS ON THE

281
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:02,102
PRESIDENT DON'T WORK.

282
00:09:02,102 --> 00:09:04,671
I THINK THERE IS AN INHERENT

283
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:06,273
DECISION HERE TO DESTROY HIS

284
00:09:06,273 --> 00:09:08,909
BASE OF SUPPORT AND THAT IS WHY

285
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:11,845
SHE HAS NOW BEEN TARGETED.

286
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,113
CLEARLY, SHE IS A STRONG WOMAN.

287
00:09:13,113 --> 00:09:16,116
SHE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,

288
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:17,484
AND THE MEDIA TRIES TO

289
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:18,786
ENFRANCHISE HER BUT SHE WILL

290
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:21,121
STICK TO WHAT MATTERS TO HER.

291
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:23,123
CHILDREN'S LIVES, SUPPORTING HER

292
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:24,558
SON AND HER FAMILY.

293
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:26,326
SO THIS IS THE ARMY OF WHAT IT

294
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:27,461
IS OF COURSE, WHAT THE MEDIA IS

295
00:09:27,461 --> 00:09:29,329
DOING AND WHAT SOME OF THE

296
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:34,134
ESTABLISHMENT IS DOING WHICH IS

297
00:09:34,134 --> 00:09:44,244
CLAIMING

298
00:09:52,186 --> 00:09:55,656
THAT WILL WORK AS A POLITICAL

299
00:09:55,656 --> 00:09:56,957
MATTER.

300
00:09:56,957 --> 00:09:58,892
>> I THINK THIS WILL BE OVER

301
00:09:58,892 --> 00:10:01,161
TOMORROW, AND SHE'S GOTTEN MORE

302
00:10:01,161 --> 00:10:04,531
ASTUTE ABOUT THE OFFICE OF THE

303
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:05,299
FIRST LADY.

304
00:10:05,299 --> 00:00:00,000
DONALD TRUMP IS 40% FAVORABLE
