in question the protesters showed up and

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,739
blockaded<font color="#E5E5E5"> the event and the judge in in</font>

14
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,260
the recent decision that came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,539
that they had significantly blockaded

significantly prevented people from

<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing it of course and so there there's</font>

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,010
some very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> details first of</font>

members who were allowing their<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh their</font>

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">classrooms to be used as staging areas</font>

26
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">set up a barricade that all the</font>

27
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,070
protesters were supposed to stay behind

28
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">and all of the protesters unanimously</font>

29
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,500
decided that they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not stay there</font>

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,470
whereupon<font color="#E5E5E5"> campus security advised them</font>

31
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,119
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are breaching the code of</font>

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,460
student behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there may be</font>

33
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,400
discipline action<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken against you so</font>

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,990
ultimately speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of the</font>

35
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,119
day there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> no discipline action</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taken</font>

36
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,729
against them and now the university is

37
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:44,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a position</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where it's saying we we</font>

38
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,560
told you you were breaching the code of

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,180
student behavior but now we're defending

40
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">your actions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you were engaged in free</font>

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,430
speech when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you blockaded</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the event and</font>

42
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,110
and we're now condoning your behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

43
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">fast</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forward a year and the same group</font>

44
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the authorized group my client decided</font>

45
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">to apply to hold the same event</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

46
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,680
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorized campus club and and they</font>

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,800

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">approved</font>

50
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,459
$17,500 security fee and so we applied

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> judicial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> review</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that decision</font>
