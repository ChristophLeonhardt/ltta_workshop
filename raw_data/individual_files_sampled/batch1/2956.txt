the prevailing view in the business world and in the world at large was the internet is not a commercial medium will never be a commercial medium it's not for consumers ordinary people won't use it and there's no money to be made on it and people who are trying to do internet-based businesses at that point we're generally ridiculed by other people saying no no that's not you know this is a joke in fact a lot of very important people in the technology industry we're going out and being on record in 1994's saying the internet will never amount to anything it's a toy it's a distraction don't pay any attention to it some very famous and prominent people were saying and so you know and I'm just like a newly minted college graduate like Who am I to argue with you know you know has a major media company sets of major phone company says major technology companies and so it wasn't until Jim Clark ultimately reached out to me and said you know we should start a company that it sort of occurred to me of like oh but it so he reached at you you're sitting in your where were you working I was great i was working at a small software company palo alto i'll call di t so you had a good job good job good salary let's have Jim Clark just calls yeah and said we got to start a company so Jim Claire calls up and says I'm Jim Clark and I said I know who you are at that time he had been the founder of Silicon Graphics Silicon Graphics at that time was kind of in the valley was what Google is today which is it was the best technology company in the valley it was like the one that everybody who was really sharp wanted to work out and it turned out I was one of about a dozen people Jim approached to start a company and it turns out I was the only one who was willing to take the leap so and so when you left he took this leap did you have a product may did you know what you were going to build or was it Jim just talked to everybody we'll figure it out when we get there we basically went through a process of elimination if interactive TV is not going to be yet for you at least years to come and if the game machines aren't going to be networked for years to come which is what we concluded then the internet by it's going to basically win by default now bear in mind 1994 right April 1994 so first of all nobody believed that anybody would buy any suffer for the internet under any circumstances no matter what number one number two there had never been an ad run on the internet ever right so there was advertising as a business model was not it was non-existent and considered not possible so the model we said was will be a software company and we'll do the client's offer essentially as a loss leader and it nice exists clients offer new successful doodles will give it away for free will do it as a loss leader and we will charge for the server software and the fact that everybody's going to have the browser means that all the companies are going to need the server software which should actually turned out to be true now there was a twist on it which was we did a dual license for the client we said let's run an experiment basically and we said let's give it away for essentially individually use as well as academic nonprofit use but let's put a clause in the license that says if you use it in a commercial environment if you use it for business you have to pay for it and let's see what happens
