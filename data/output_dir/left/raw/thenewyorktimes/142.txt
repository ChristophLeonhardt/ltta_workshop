1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,150
Justice Anthony Kennedy
announced his retirement,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,689
effective July 31.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,100
Justice Kennedy’s
greatest judicial legacy

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,560
was his
championship of gay rights.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,230
He wrote every major gay
rights decision,

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,510
including one called Obergefell,
which established

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,250
a constitutional right
to same-sex marriage,

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,910
and it will be what he is most
remembered for.

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,790
Justice Kennedy was a moderate
conservative; voted more often

10
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,630
with the court’s
conservative wing;

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,750
was the author of Citizens
United, which amplified

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,260
the role of money in politics;

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,400
cast a vote with the
five-justice majority

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,530
in Bush v. Gore
in 2000,

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,740
which handed the presidency
to President George W. Bush —

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,600
“I George Walker Bush,
do solemnly swear."

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,810
— joined the five-justice
majority

18
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,270
in District of Columbia
against Heller,

19
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,090
which revolutionized
Second Amendment law

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,830
and established a personal
right to keep and bear arms.

21
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,470
He was often prepared to cut
back on the death penalty,

22
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,880
whether it involved
people

23
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,810
with intellectual disabilities,

24
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,900
people who committed crimes

25
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,660
when they were younger
than 18

26
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,790
or people who committed
crimes other than murder.

27
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,330
He joined the controlling
opinion and in a 1992 decision,

28
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,810
Planned Parenthood against
Casey, which re-established

29
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,950
and saved Roe v. Wade,
the decision that

30
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,980
guarantees a constitutional
right to abortion.

31
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,760
And in recent years,

32
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,790
he has joined the
court’s liberals

33
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,480
in cases on affirmative
action and abortion.

34
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,570
And those cases in which
Justice Kennedy joined

35
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,630
the court's four more
liberal members are almost

36
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,000
certainly at risk if
President Trump appoints

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:00:00,000
a conservative to the court.
