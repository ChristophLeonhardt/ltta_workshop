1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:05,470
Today’s Democratic Party believes government
has an important role to play in society.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,160
It fights against economic inequality.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,090
It advocates policies that battle racial and
gender discrimination.

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,029
But it wasn’t always this way.

5
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:19,610
The Democratic Party was once the party of
white supremacy, supporting slavery and the

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,380
Ku Klux Klan.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,090
To understand how the party made such a huge
shift, you have to go back to the party’s

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,321
origins in the mid-1820s, when it sprung up
supporting the presidential candidacy of a

9
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,910
popular former general, Andrew Jackson.

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,800
Jackson was an outsider challenging the political
establishment and elites of his day, and his

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,350
critics disparaged him as a “jackass.”

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,210
But Jackson embraced the animal as a symbol
of determination, and donkeys started appearing

13
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,200
in newspapers to represent him and his followers.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,620
In the 1828 presidential election, which saw
record-breaking popular participation, Jackson

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,480
won a landslide victory.

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,540
So his supporters argued that they and not
the old elites represented the popular will

17
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,370
of the country — and they started calling
themselves the Democratic Party.

18
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:12,159
Jackson’s administration immediately began
expelling Native Americans living east of

19
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,630
the Mississippi River, an issue that defined
the new administration.

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,560
After he signed the Indian Removal Act into
law in 1830, five large tribes were rounded

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,720
up and forcibly marched to territories and
camps further west.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,259
And Democrats’ ambitions didn’t stop there.

23
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:34,539
In the 1840s, the party adopted the doctrine
of “manifest destiny” — the idea that

24
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:38,279
Americans — white Americans — were divinely

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,280
entitled to dominate the whole North American continent.

26
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:46,659
Democratic president James K. Polk put this
idea into action, massively expanding US holdings

27
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:52,759
by annexing Texas, acquiring Oregon, and winning
much of what’s now the southwestern US in

28
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,289
a war with Mexico.

29
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:59,659
But soon afterward, national politics devolved
into bitter controversy over whether new states

30
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:04,149
entering the Union should be permitted to
allow slavery.

31
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:08,630
Democrats said they should, since their support
base was strongest in the slaveholding South.

32
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,790
Yet a new Northern party — the Republicans
—

33
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,960
sprang up in opposition to expanding slavery any further.

34
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:20,970
When Republican Abraham Lincoln won the presidency,
the South seceded, and the Civil War began.

35
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,590
Once the Civil War was over, the Republican
party was bitterly unpopular among white Southerners,

36
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,470
who wanted to maintain their supremacy over
former slaves.

37
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,310
So the Democratic Party promised to limit
federal government intervention on behalf

38
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,070
of black citizens.

39
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,650
Democrats became effectively the only political
party in the South, aided by intimidation

40
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,400
and suppression of black voters.

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,150
Democrats also won on the state and local
level leading to constant abuses of the rights

42
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,950
of black citizens.

43
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:55,480
As the 20th century began, the country was
changing, and the Democratic Party was changing too.

44
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,800
A handful of individuals and corporations
had grown enormously rich and powerful, using

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,440
their vast fortunes to influence politics.

46
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,090
As a reaction to this, some reformers began
pushing an agenda of progressivism — arguing

47
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,590
that the government would take more of a role
in regulating big businesses and improving

48
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,320
ordinary people’s lives.

49
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,380
At first, these progressive reformers were
present in both parties.

50
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,580
But it was Democrat Woodrow Wilson who won
the presidency in 1912 and put much of this

51
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,250
agenda into action, over Republican resistance.

52
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,700
So the Democratic Party became the main home
for progressives, and Republicans became more

53
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,360
the party of business.

54
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,819
But it was the Great Depression of the 1930s
that sealed the Democratic Party’s new identity

55
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,550
as the party of government activism.

56
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:47,480
In an effort to combat the crippling economic
situation, President Franklin Roosevelt signed

57
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,600
what was then the largest package of domestic
government projects in American History, calling

58
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,680
calling it the New Deal.

59
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,860
His administration dramatically expanded the
size of government.

60
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,710
Yet the party was still split over race.

61
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:05,630
By the mid-20th century, it contained Southerners
who staunchly supported segregation, liberal

62
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,370
reformers trying to end it, and many politicians
happy to look the other way.

63
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:16,589
But it was 1964 when the senate voted on the
anti segregation civil rights act that shows

64
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,458
how the progressive reformers in the party
had gained the upper hand, steering the party

65
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,370
away from its racists past towards equality.

66
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,759
But the democrats in the south voted against
the civil rights act, remaining wedded to

67
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,400
the idea of segregation.

68
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,560
This chart shows the presidential vote of
black voters.

69
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,110
Around the 1960s the Black voters who had
already been moving toward the Democratic

70
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,980
party would begin overwhelmingly support Democrats
from then on, and conversely the republicans

71
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,199
would take a huge hit in black voter support.

72
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,270
Meanwhile, white Southerners, moved away from
the Democratic Party they had been loyal to

73
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:57,069
for so long — in part because of race, but
also because of suspicion of big government

74
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:01,379
and a desire to defend “traditional values”
against liberal activists.

75
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:06,520
Democrats would go from dominating the South,
to losing almost all influence in the region.

76
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,849
Thanks in part to this drop in popularity
among white voters, Democrats started losing

77
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:14,130
elections, often losing by huge margins.

78
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:21,090
But demographically, the US is becoming an
increasingly non-white country, and the democrats

79
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,680
have had a comeback thanks in part to minority
voters.

80
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,169
The huge influx of hispanic voters has especially
benefitted democrats.

81
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:34,559
These demographic shifts helped the Democratic
Party, once the advocates of white supremacy

82
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:40,669
and slavery to elect the first black president
in 2008, showing just how much the party had

83
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:41,909
changed over the years.

84
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:46,180
Yet it’s still not entirely clear where
the future of the Democratic Party will lie.

85
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,729
But as America becomes more diverse, it’s
likely that the democratic party’s appeal

86
00:05:50,729 --> 00:00:00,000
among minorities will continue to be its strength
into the future.
