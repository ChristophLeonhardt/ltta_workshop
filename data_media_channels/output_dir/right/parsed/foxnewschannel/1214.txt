CONNECTED.
WE KNOW AT LEAST THE FIRST THREE
ARE.
ELIZABETH: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DISTURBING.
LELAND.
LELAND: TODAY MARKS PRESIDENT
TRUMP 500th DAY IN OFFICE AND
HE OFFICE AND HE'S WRITING ON
THE HEELS OF A POSITIVE JOBS
REPORT AND RECORD LOW
UNEMPLOYMENT.
ISSUES THAT GENERALLY PUSH
VOTERS TO THE POLLS.
SPEAKING OF POLLS RIGHT NOW.
VOTERS NATIONWIDE WERE
INFINITELY MORE TOWARDS
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS THE
GENERIC CONGRESSIONAL VOTE.
AS YOU CAN SEE, IT HAS TAKEN
SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.
FIVE STATES HAVE PRIMARIES ON
TUESDAY.
JOINING US NOW FROM TWO OF THOSE
STATES, CALIFORNIA LATER POST IN
IOWA RADIO HOST STEVE DAYS.
NICE TO SEE BOTH OF YOU.
RIGHT NOW YOU'VE GOT THE
ECONOMIC ARGUMENT COMING OUT OF
THE WHITE HOUSE.
THE FOREIGN-POLICY ARGUMENT OUT
OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEN THE
PRESIDENT ATTORNEYS GOING ON
OFFENSE AGAINST THE MOLAR
INVESTIGATION.
TAKE A LISTEN TO RUDY GIULIANI
LATER TODAY -- EARLIER TODAY.
>> THIS IS THE WHAT THE
PRESIDENT TESTIFIED.
OUR RECOLLECTION KEEPS CHANGING
HER WERE NOT EVEN ASKED THE
QUESTION SO NOBODY MAKES AN
ASSUMPTION.
IN MY CASE I MADE AN ASSUMPTION
WE CORRECTED AND GOT IT RIGHT
OUT AS SOON AS IT HAPPENED.
>> STEVE, WE HAVE SEEN THE WHITE
HOUSE AND ITS OUTSIDE COUNSEL
REALLY TURN UP THE HEAT ON THE
MOLAR INVESTIGATION.
IS THAT GALVANIZE REPUBLICANS TO
TALK TO OR DOES IT SLIP THEM A
LITTLE BIT?
>> I THINK RIGHT NOW ALMOST
EVERYTHING HAS THE OPTION OF
EITHER GALVANIZING YOUR BASE
AND/OR GALVANIZING THE OTHER AT
THE EXACT SAME TIME.
WE HAVE A MOTTO ON MY SHOW,
WHOEVER LOSES BECAUSE WE HAVE
GOT THIS FASCINATING, THIS
CONTRASTS WITH THE TYPICAL
ECONOMIC ISSUES THAT DRIVE THE
ELECTORATE ARE IN FAVOR OF TRUMP
AND THE REPUBLICANS.
ON THE OTHER HAND, HIS APPROVAL
RATING IS STILL VERY MUCH IN THE
DANGER ZONE.
THE ENERGY LEVEL AS WE'VE SEEN
IN ELECTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY
IS STILL VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF
DEMOCRATS AND THOSE USUALLY
PORTEND THE OUTCOME OF MIDTERM
ELECTIONS AS WELL.
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE EVER
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE
TYPICALLY THE REASON WHY THE
OTHER SIDE IS ENERGIZED IS
BECAUSE YOUR POLICIES ARE NOT
POPULAR.
IN THIS CASE, TRUMP'S POLICIES
ARE FAR MORE POPULAR THAN HE IS.
IT WOULD BE FASCINATING TO SEE
THE VOTERS SORT THIS OUT COME
NOVEMBER.
>> TWITTER WILL SORT OUT WHICH
ONE OF THE THREE OF US WAS
CLASS.
WE WILL TUNE IN FOR THAT.
WE WOULD GET YOU TO RESPOND TO
STEVE IN THE SENSE THAT
DEMOCRATS NOW HAVE TO CHANGE
THEIR PLAYBOOK.
EVEN DEMOCRATS WHO COME ON THE
SHOW AND MUCH MORE ABOUT
ATTACKING HIM IN GOING AFTER HIM
ON RUSSIA.
>> WELL, I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT'S
WHAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO DO.
THEY HAVE TO DO MORE THAN NOT.
THEY CAN JUST BE WE ARE NOT
SHOWN, PARTY OF TRUMP ARE
DIFFERENT FROM TRUMP BECAUSE
WE'VE SEEN IN SOME DISTRICTS IN
ELECTIONS WHERE THERE'VE BEEN
SUCCESSFUL IN FLIPPING IT WHERE
THERE HAS BEEN A MORE MODERATE
TONE WITH REGARD TO THE
PRESIDENT.
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE
CONSTITUENCY.
WE HAD 10 DISTRICTS RIGHT HERE
IN THIS STATE IN CALIFORNIA THAT
ARE VERY FOOTBALL BOWL TO BLUE
FOR BREAD.
THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHIC OF
CALIFORNIA SHOWS THAT AND QUITE
FRANKLY IF DEMOCRATS OFTEN SOME
OF THOSE ISSUES AND THE
DEMOGRAPHICS THAT ARE VERY
IMPORTANT LIKE IMMIGRATION,
WALLS THAT THEY DON'T WANT BUILT
IN A LOT OF THESE DISTRICTS AND
SEPARATION OF CHILDREN FROM
FAMILIES AND THE LACK OF
IMMIGRATION POLICY.
ALSO THE ISSUE OF GUN CONTROL
AND A LACK OF THOSE ISSUES THAT
MAY GET DEMOCRATS OUT TO VOTE.
AS A DEMOCRAT, WE ARE GREAT AT
MARCHING AND WE HAVE ALL THESE
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE REGISTERING
TO VOTE AND THAT IS AWESOME AND
MANY ARE REGISTERING AS
DEMOCRATS.
OR SO INDEPENDENCE.
IF THEY DON'T VOTE, IT DOESN'T
HELP ANYBODY FLIPPING A DISTRICT
EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA.
>> I THINK IT WAS ON THE WEST
WING DAYSIDE DECIDED BY THOSE
WHO SHOW UP.
STEVE, TO YOU NOW, THIS IS
SOMETHING SPLITTING THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY, ESPECIALLY IN
IOWA.
HE SHOULD PRESIDENT TRUMP
STARES.
LARRY KUDLOW ON "FOX NEWS
SUNDAY" IN THEM WILL GET YOUR
REACTION.
>> I DON'T DENY THAT.
YOU COULD JEOPARDIZE THAT.
>> AS POSSIBLE, ABSOLUTELY.
>> THE ECONOMY IS ON FIRE.
UNEMPLOYMENT THREE-POINT LEAD.
DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE SHOW WE
SAY X DOES REPUBLICAN BASE ON
TARIFFS?
>> I THINK HE DEFINITELY DOES.
HE'S GOT AN EXPOSED FLANK WITH
EVERYDAY AMERICANS.
WHEN YOU GET INTO TARIFFS OVER
HERE IN SUBSIDIES OVER THERE,
YOU START GROUPS AGAINST ONE
ANOTHER AND DEMOCRATS ARE FAR
BETTER AT THAT THAN REPUBLICANS
ARE.
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
I'M IN A GROCERY STORE HERE
RECENTLY GOING THROUGH THE
EXPRESS LANE AND THE WOMAN AHEAD
TO ME WANTS TO KNOW WHY HER
CARTON OF EGGS OR $3 WHEN THEY
WERE MUCH CHEAPER A FEW MONTHS
AGO.
WE KNOW THE ANSWER.
IT IS A TRADE WAR, THE THREAT OF
TERRORISTS COME AT HENRY.
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE NEARLY
THE UNREST IN THE MIDDLE EAST
FROM MOVING THE EMBASSY TO
JERUSALEM.
RELATIVELY SPEAKING WE HAVE AS
MUCH CONSISTENT PIECE IN THE
MIDDLE EAST AS WE'VE HAD
POST-9/11.
YET WHEN I WANT TO FILL UP AT
COSTCO THE OTHER DAY HERE IN DES
MOINES TO COST ME $45 GOOD WIFE
PASSED AWAY NOT.
WHY ARE THE OF EGGS MORE AT THE
STORE.
THOSE ARE THE THINGS THEY DON'T
GET INTO COMPLEX ECONOMIC AREAS
AND BATTLING TALKING POINTS.
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THIS
FOR ME.
RIGHT NOW A LOT OF GOOD THINGS
FOR THE TRUMP ECONOMY FOR THEM.
WHEN YOU WERE TO RAZORS THAT OF
MARGINS COME YOU DON'T HAVE TO
ALIENATE A LOT OF PEOPLE TO
CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF THE
ELECTORATE COME NOVEMBER.
LELAND: I ONLY HAVE 15 SECONDS
BUT I WANT TO GET YOU IN.
HOW DO DEMOCRATS EXPLOIT THE
VIEW WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT?
>> I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH STEVE
ON THIS ONE BECAUSE IT'S NOT
JUST THE ECONOMY.
IT'S THE PERCEPTION OF A PERSON
ECONOMIC SITUATION THAT IS THE
REALITY.
THEY ARE GOING TO THE PUMPS AND
PRICES ARE HIGHER.
THE WAGE GROWTH IS NOT THE,
WHICH WE HAVE NOT SEEN.
WE SAW DURING THE OBAMA YEARS
UNEMPLOYMENT DROPPED OVER AND
OVER IN ELECTIONS.
SO IT'S REALLY THE FEELING OF
PERCEPTION ECONOMICALLY AT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN THEY GO TO
VOTE.
>> PERHAPS AS STEVE POINTS OUT
HOW THEY FEEL AT THE PUMP IN THE
GROCERY STORE WAY, WAY OUT WAY
