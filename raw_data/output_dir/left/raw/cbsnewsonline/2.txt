LOT OF POLICE PRESENCE, IT IS 

114
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:31,678
IMPORTANT THAT WE PROACTIVELY

116
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:37,817

CLEARLY, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN 

118
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,019
THE LAST FEW DAYS IS AN ATTACK 

119
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,057
ON MEDIA OUTLETS, AN ATTACK ON 

120

PART OF HOW WE PROTECT THE

RESILIENCY THAT THE CITY IS 

141
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,668

THE SITUATION WITH A REAL SENSE 

145
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,942
OF RESOLVE, THEY ARE NOT GOING 

146
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,012
TO LET AN ACT OF TERROR 

147
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:39,412
INTIMIDATE THEM. 

148
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,913

249
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,618
IT BEARS REPEATING TODAY. 

250
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:09,755
IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE 

251
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,123
DON'T DISCLOSE INFORMATION THAT 

252
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:14,226

POWDER, THE INITIAL ANALYSIS 

272
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,901
INDICATES THAT THE POWDER IN 

273
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:56,535
THOSE PARTICULAR ENVELOPES DID 

274
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,437
NOT PRESENT A BIOLOGICAL THREAT.

OTHER ANALYSIS IS ONGOING. 

276
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,380
HOWEVER, IT IS WORTH REPEATING, 

277
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,247
THAT ANY DEVICE COULD BE 

278
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:08,747

EXPLODE OR DO YOU THINK THEY 

388
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,545

AS FAR AS THE POWDER, WE ARE 

416
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,232
JUST GOING TO LEAVE IT THAT IT 

417
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:28,233
IS NOT BIOLOGICAL, WE ARE 

418
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:33,138

419
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,273
SAW REPORTS THEY MAY HAVE COME 

420
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,641

I'M SORRY?

FRONT OF LOCATIONS THAT WE 

469

THOUGHT MIGHT BE UNDER 

470
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,489
INCREASED THREAT, WHEN THE

SPECULATION AND TALK ABOUT 

493
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,234

SOMETHING THAT WAS A HOAX OR 

498
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:26,444
SHOULD WE BE TAKING IT 

499
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:26,744
SERIOUSLY? 

500
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:31,150
>> IT SHOULD BE TAKEN 

501
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:31,984
SERIOUSLY, NYPD AND FBI ARE 

502
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,252
TREATING THEM AS LIVE DEVICES, 

503
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,088
AS YOU SEE THE WAY THE BOMB 

504
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,557
SQUAD DETECTIVES WENT INTO CNN 

505
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,758
YESTERDAY, THIS HAS TO BE TAKEN 

506
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:43,829
WITH THE UTMOST SERIOUSNESS, AS 

507
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,097
FAR AS A HOAX DEVICE, WE ARE 

508
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,031
NOT TREATING IT THAT WAY. 

509
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,268
>> FOR THE MAYOR, DO YOU 

510
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,602
DEFINITELY FEEL THIS IS 

511
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,304
TERRORISM RELATED, AND WHAT YOU 

512
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,640
SAY TO THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK? 

513
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,975
>> IT IS ABSOLUTELY TERRORISM, 

514
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,310
BECAUSE IT IS AN EFFORT TO USE 

515
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,477
VIOLENCE TO MAKE A POLITICAL 

516
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:02,448
IMPACT, THAT'S THE DEFINITION 

517
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,615
OF TERRORISM. 

518
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:04,716
THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK CITY ARE 

519
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,085
AS TOUGH AS IT GETS, THE CITY 

520
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,788
HAS BEEN THROUGH TERROR ATTACKS 

521
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:10,289
BEFORE. 

522
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,623
THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY 

523
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,859
UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE GAME PLAN 

524
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,796
OF TERRORISM TO INTIMIDATE US, 

525
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,331
NEW YORKERS REFUSED TO BE 

526
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,532
INTIMIDATED, THAT'S WHAT WE SEE 

527
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:26,004
TIME AND TIME AGAIN. 

528
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,139
1993, THE FIRST BOMBING OF THE 

529
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,240
WORLD TRADE CENTER, AND 

530
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,641
EVERYTHING SINCE, THE PEOPLE IN 

531
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,210
THE CITY ARE FULL OF RESOLVE, 

532
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,078
AND DON'T LET THESE THINGS 

533
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,613
THROW US OFF OUR GAME. 

534
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,083
AND I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT 

535
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,718
TO INHIBITING TERRORISM GOING 

536
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:40,119
FORWARD. 

537
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,753
TO CONSISTENTLY SHOW THOSE WHO 

538
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,655
WOULD ATTACK US THAT THEIR 

539
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,691
EFFORTS ARE IN VAIN. 

540
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:49,161
NEW YORKERS HAVE BEEN EXEMPLARY,

541
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:57,436
THEY DO HEED THE WARNING, IF YOU

542
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,136
SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING, 

543
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,304
BUT I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE, WE 

544
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,505
SEE THIS A LOT, PEOPLE 

545
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:01,206
SHOULDN'T HESITATE, SOMEONE IS 

546
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,107
LOOKING AT SOMETHING, THEIR 

547
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,109
CONCERN, MAYBE I SHOULD CALL OR 

548
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:08,247
NOT, IF IT IS ON THE CUSP, MAKE 

549
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,314
THE CALL, IF YOU THINK YOU 

550
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,783
SHOULD, MAKE THE CALL. 

551
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:12,717

00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,389
WANT FOLKS TO DO, AND FRANKLY, 

735
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,759
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT THE BROADER 

736
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,394
PUBLIC TO DO, THEIR JOB IS TO 

737
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:02,927
BRING AWARENESS. 

738
00:26:02,927 --> 00:26:05,296
ON THE REST OF US TO LISTEN AND 

739
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:06,431
PAY ATTENTION, AND YOU AND THE 

740
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,433
MEDIA TO RELAY THE MESSAGE.

741
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,136
>> SOURCES SAY IT LOOKS LIKE 

742
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,403
THEY MAY HAVE ORIGINATED IN 

743
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:14,272
FLORIDA, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 

744
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,041
FOR INVESTIGATORS?

745
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:21,446
>>LINE UP WITH OTHER 

746
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:24,516
INFORMATION, THAT MAY BE STILL  

747
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:29,354
EARLY, AND BILL SWEENEY 

748
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,388
MENTIONED THIS, WE ARE VERY 

749
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,256
EARLY IN THIS INVESTIGATION, 

750
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,158
SO, I HAVE TO LOOK HARD AT 

751
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:38,396
EVERY LEAD THAT COMES IN, AND 

752
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:38,863
EVERY POSSIBILITY. 

753
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,065
DOES IT START TO NARROW DOWN 

754
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:40,765
FOR SOMEBODY IN FLORIDA? 

755
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:46,838
THAT'S GREAT IF IT DOES. 

756
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,540
AND, IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE THE 

757
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:48,773
PERSON. 

758
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,874
BUT THEY REALLY NEED TO KEEP 

759
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:53,111
THE APERTURE WIDE OPEN, AND 

760
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:53,778
CONSIDER ANY POSSIBILITY, 

761
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:54,746
WHETHER THIS IS THE EXTREMIST 

762
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,281
ON THE FAR RIGHT OR SOMEBODY ON 

763
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,716
THE FAR LEFT, LOOKING TO RAISE 

764
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:58,883
SOME SORT OF SYMPATHY, LOOKING 

765
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:04,589
TO CHANGE THE COURSE. 

766
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:05,724
I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY FOR US 

767
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,557
TO GET TO CONCLUSIONS. 

768
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:11,496
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PURSUED 

769
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:11,729
SOON. 

770
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:12,697
>> WALK ME THROUGH THIS. 

771
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,065
THE BOMB IS NOW WITH THE FBI. 

772
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,733
THEY ARE LOOKING AT IT IN 

773
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:18,336
QUANTICO, I BELIEVE. 

774
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,537
FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE LOOKING 

775
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:20,972
AT THIS, HOW DO THEY BREAK DOWN 

776
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:24,643
A DEVICE LIKE THIS TO TRY TO 

777
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:29,080
EXTRAPOLATE CLUES? 

778
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,281
>> SO, THERE ARE MULTIPLE, VERY 

779
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:31,116
SOPHISTICATED UNITS, DOWN IN 

780
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,316
QUANTICO, THAT WILL BE 

781
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:36,187
PRIORITIZING THE ORDER OF THE 

782
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:36,988
EXAMINATIONS, TO DETERMINE, TO 

783
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:42,694
WE TRY TO EXAMINE FOR 

784
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:43,027
FINGERPRINTS? 

785
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:44,329
DO WE TRY TO COLLECT THE DNA 

786
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,096
FIRST? 

787
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:49,534
AFTER THAT, THE EXPLOSIVES 

788
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:50,635
FOLKS WILL BE PULLING APART, TO 

789
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,870
LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS 

790
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,971
IN GREAT DETAIL? 

791
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:56,040
THEY HAVE TOOL MARKS AND 

792
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,979
FIREARMS UNIT THAT ARE LOOKING 

793
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:01,579
FOR TWO MARKS. 

794
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,081
WHAT ARE THE END CUTS ON THE 

795
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:03,281
TAPE? 

796
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,616
ON THE WIRING? 

797
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,017
WHAT KIND OF PIPE IS THIS? 

798
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:12,457
WHERE IS IT PRODUCED? 

799
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:13,591
THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT IT 

800
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,158
THROUGH MICROSCOPES, AND 

801
00:28:14,158 --> 00:28:15,393
THROUGH USING ALL OF THE TOOLS 

802
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,127
WE HAVE IN A VERY DETAILED 

803
00:28:17,127 --> 00:28:18,863
PROCEDURE, TO BREAK IT DOWN 

804
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,031
INTO THE FINEST COMPONENTS. 

805
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,866
AND TO CONCLUDE, TO GO BACK TO 

806
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:26,971
THE FORENSICS OF, COULD THESE 

807
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:27,672
DEVICES HAVE DETONATED? 

808
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:28,606
WERE THEY DESIGNED TO DETONATE? 

809
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,141
WERE THEY PERHAPS NOT DESIGNED 

810
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,978
TO DETONATE, BUT TO INTIMIDATE? 

811
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,079
THEY WILL BREAK THAT ALL DOWN. 

812
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,881
THEY WILL BE SENDING LEADS BACK 

813
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:43,153
TO THE JTTF, TO SAY, THIS IS 

814
00:28:43,153 --> 00:28:44,322
WHERE YOU CAN FIND THE PRODUCER 

815
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,457
OF THIS PVC, OF THE INTERNAL úW 

816
00:28:46,457 --> 00:28:49,527
COMPONENTS, OF THE EXPLOSIVES. 

817
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,129
ALL OF THAT WILL BE BROKEN DOWN 

818
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:51,996
AND ADDITIONAL LEADS WILL BE 

819
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:52,830
SENT OUT. 

820
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:56,568
>> RON HOSKO, ALWAYS GREAT TO 

821
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,468
HAVE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS. 

822
00:28:57,468 --> 00:29:02,707
THANK YOU SO MUCH, RON. 

823
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:03,307
>> SURE THING. 

824
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:04,542
ú>> NIKKI BATIST 

825
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:05,844
CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH WHAT 

826
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,612
WE'VE LEARNED FROM NYPD JUST A 

827
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:19,057
SHORT TIME AGO? 

828
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:19,691
>> Reporter: HI. 

829
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:19,891
YES. 

830
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:20,992
THEY WERE CAREFUL TO SAY TOO 

831
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:21,593
MUCH ABOUT THIS. 

832
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,726
SORRY, I HAVE TO WHISPER 

833
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:23,828

CONFERENCE GOING ON BEHIND ME. 

835
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,197
I THINK THE MAIN POINT THAT WE 

836
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:27,432
LEARNED IS THAT MAYOR DE BLASIO 

837
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,867
IN NEW YORK IS SAYING THIS IS 

838
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:29,567
AN ACT OF TERRORISM. 

839
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:30,768
ALSO WE ARE LEARNING THAT THE 

840
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:32,003
WHITE POWDER MAILED TO THE CNN 

841
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,271
OFFICES IS NOT A BIOLOGICAL 

842
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:33,504
THREAT. 

843
00:29:33,504 --> 00:29:34,405
I'M SORRY, THEY ARE TELLING US 

844
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,141
WE HAVE TO CUT OFF SO I'M GOING 

845
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,041
TO LEAVE IT AT THAT. 

846
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,476
I HAVE TO TOSS BACK TO YOU. 

847
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:39,343
