like in a karate expert break a brick without breaking his hand it has to do with the impact time it's very quick and the brick bend this down a little bit during the impact in that hand moves up a little bit but when the brick moves down a little bit it breaks and the hand is much more elastic so it can move up a given distance without the bone being impacted and so it doesn't break the key is to break the brick if you hit a brick in a doesn't break then the impact time is much longer than there's time for your hand to break so the key to breaking your brick is first of all to hit the brick as fast as you can to observe the greater force and to have the confidence that it's going to break so that you don't hold up and slow down which might cause your hand to break because the brick doesn't break
