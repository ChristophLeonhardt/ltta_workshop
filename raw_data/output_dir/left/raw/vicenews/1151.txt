00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,940
— In April, Xu Xiaodong,

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,320
an MMA teacher on a personal quest to
expose, quote, “fake martial arts” in China,

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,200
was challenged to a fight by a Tai Chi Master—

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,360
who he beat up in about 12 seconds.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,700
And the video went viral almost as fast.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,740
But many in China saw Xu’s victory as an attack

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,960
on Chinese traditions by a Western-style fighter,

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,360
and Xu was pummeled in the press.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,400
Then, he disappeared.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,180
VICE News tracked him down to a gym in Beijing,

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,300
where he’s preparing to face off
against another Tai Chi master on Monday.

12
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,300
— Xu Xiaodong first became a
professional MMA fighter in 1999.

13
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,060
But nowadays, he’s more of a businessman:
He’s opened up several gyms across China,

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,620
and spends his time organizing and promoting fights.

15
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,800
— Why do you think people are
so upset about this fight, then?

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,060
— The Chinese Wushu Association,
a government-run organization,

17
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,140
issued a statement condemning the fight,

18
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,680
saying that it violated the morals of martial arts.

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,720
That fight touched a nerve in China.

20
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,160
A lot of people took it as a humiliation
of traditional Chinese culture

21
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,280
by a more violent, Western import.

22
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,520
Tai Chi used to be known for its use on the battlefield.

23
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,000
Now, it’s mostly known as an exercise to keep people fit.

24
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,500
— Xu seems to think otherwise.

25
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,580
— He’s not afraid to get what he wants.

26
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,720
He even stole our producer’s lunch
out of the fridge and ate it.

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,420
— I mean, the fight was pretty brutal, right?

28
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,080
I mean, at the very end you…

29
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,980
kept going, you didn’t stop.

30
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,000
What was that like?

31
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,360
— After the initial fight, Xu was forced into hiding.

32
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,380
He announced back in May that all of his
social media accounts were allegedly taken down

33
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,200
from the government-monitored
social media platform, Weibo.

34
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,800
— But that's not exactly what
he told us when we met in person.

35
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,020
— For a while, talking about you or the
fight on the internet, period, was blocked.

36
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,500
Is that over yet?

37
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,280
— But, whatever actually went down,

38
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,540
Xu’s back in action and committed to his mission.

39
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,700
As he gears up for Monday’s big fight,

40
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,640
he might not want to talk about the government,

41
00:04:52,640 --> 00:00:00,000
but he’s happy to express
his opinions about everything else.
