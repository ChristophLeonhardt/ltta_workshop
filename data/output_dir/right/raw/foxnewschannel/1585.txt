WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT

22
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:38,195
NUMEROUS THINGS.

23
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:39,430
ONE OF THE ELEMENTS SO IMPORTANT

24
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,464
TO US IS TO DISCUSS THE BORDER

25
00:00:40,464 --> 00:00:44,601
AND BORDER SECURITY, CRIME AND

26
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:46,236
OTHER THINGS, BUT THAT'S WHAT WE

27
00:00:46,236 --> 00:00:47,204
WILL BE FOCUSING ON TONIGHT.

28
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:48,439
WE ARE GRATEFUL ALSO TO BE

29
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,507
JOINED BY SECRETARY NIELSEN, WHO

30
00:00:50,507 --> 00:00:55,646
IS REALLY WORKING VERY HARD.

31
00:00:55,646 --> 00:00:56,213
BAD LAWS.

32
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:57,247
WE HAVE LAWS THAT ARE THE WORST

33
00:00:57,247 --> 00:01:00,484
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AS FAR AS

34
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:02,219
STOPPING PEOPLE FROM COMING IN,

35
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,221
BUT WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE ARE

36
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:05,856
DOWN OVER 40% BORDER CROSSINGS.

37
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:08,826
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WHAT I

38
00:01:08,826 --> 00:01:10,994
THINK NOBODY ELSE HAS BEEN ABLE

39
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:14,832
TO DO, WE ARE DOWN OVER 40%.

40
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:15,599
TONIGHT WE WILL BE DISCUSSING

41
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,968
JOINT EFFORTS TO STOP ILLEGAL

42
00:01:17,968 --> 00:01:20,003
IMMIGRATION AND SECURE THE

43
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:21,405
BORDERS ALSO.

44
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:23,407
WE ARE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING

45
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:25,042
THE DEADLY RAVAGES OF DRUGS,

46
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:26,276
GANGS AND CRIME THAT IS POURING

47
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:29,313
ACROSS OUR BORDER AND WE ARE

48
00:01:29,313 --> 00:01:30,047
STOPPING IT AND GETTING THEM OUT

49
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:32,916
WHEN THEY ARE ABLE TO GET

50
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:34,385
THROUGH AND THE ONLY REASON THEY

51
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,286
DO GET THROUGH IS BECAUSE OF OUR

52
00:01:36,286 --> 00:01:38,021
WEAK LAWS THAT REALLY HAVE BEEN

53
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:41,592
GIVEN TO US BY WEEK PEOPLE IN

54
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:42,326
CONGRESS, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE

55
00:01:42,326 --> 00:01:44,595
BEEN HORRIBLE ON BORDER SECURITY

56
00:01:44,595 --> 00:01:45,362
BEEN HORRIBLE ON BORDER SECURIT

57
00:01:45,362 --> 00:01:45,729
SECURITY.

58
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:48,132
FRANKLY, IT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED

59
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:50,534
AND MANY OF THEM ARE STANDING

60
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:54,004
AGREEING WITH ME 100%.

61
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:56,039
AS YOU KNOW, I RECENTLY DEPLOYED

00:01:57,775 --> 00:01:58,842
SOUTHERN BORDER AND I WANT TO

64
00:01:58,842 --> 00:02:01,145
THANK EACH OF THE GOVERNORS HERE

65
00:02:01,145 --> 00:02:01,879
TONIGHT.

66
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,614
THEY'VE ALL BEEN EXTREMELY

67
00:02:03,614 --> 00:02:03,947
HELPFUL.

68
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:05,449
IF SENT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO THOSE

69
00:02:05,449 --> 00:02:06,817
BORDERS AND WE APPRECIATE IT

70
00:02:06,817 --> 00:02:07,851
VERY MUCH.

71
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:09,485
WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH

72
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:12,689
CONGRESS TO CLOSE THE CRIPPLING

73
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:14,725
LOOPHOLES AND ESPECIALLY THE

74
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:16,126
DISGRACEFUL PRACTICE OF CATCH

75
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:17,027
AND RELEASE.

76
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:17,961
THAT'S WHERE YOU CATCH SOMEBODY

77
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:19,763
COME AND TALK TO THEM, SIGN THEM

78
00:02:19,763 --> 00:02:21,632
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO RELEASE

79
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:23,434
THEM.

80
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,235
AND IT'S A HORRIBLE SITUATION.

81
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:26,703
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO THEN SHOW

82
00:02:26,703 --> 00:02:29,373
UP TO COURT, A VERY SMALL

83
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:31,074
PERCENTAGE SHOW UP TO COURT AND

84
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:32,876
WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY GET LOST IN

85
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:34,812
OUR COUNTRY AND IN SOME CASES

86
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:36,613
THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE THAT YOU

87
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:37,147
WANT IN THE COUNTRY.

88
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:38,615
SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CATCH

89
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:39,049
AND RELEASE.

90
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:40,417
WE HAVE TO END IT.

91
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:42,619
WE ARE WORKING WITH CONGRESS ON

92
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:43,420
THAT.

93
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,121
THESE LAWS HAVE BEEN THERE A

94
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:46,023
LONG TIME AND THEY ARE HORRIBLE.

95
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:48,025
AT THE SAME TIME, WE WILL USE

96
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:49,059
EVERY RELEVANT LEGAL AUTHORITY

97
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:50,794
TO IMMEDIATELY PROTECT OUR

98
00:02:50,794 --> 00:02:55,299
NATIONAL SECURITY AND TO

99
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:56,133
DISMANTLE THE VIOLENT CRIMINAL

100
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:56,967
ORGANIZATIONS PLAGUING THE

101
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:58,035
NATION AND POISONING OUR

102
00:02:58,035 --> 00:02:58,769
CHILDREN.

103
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:01,772
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH DRUGS IS A

104
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:02,172
DISGRACE.

105
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:05,476
WHICH STARTED THE WALL, WE HAVE

106
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,978
$1.6 BILLION FOR THE WALL.

107
00:03:07,978 --> 00:03:09,913
WE STARTED NEW SECTIONS AND WE

108
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:12,382
STARTED FIXING LARGE SECTIONS OF

109
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:13,083
WALL.

110
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,986
WE HAVE AREAS IN SAN DIEGO THAT

111
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:17,020
ARE GOING UP VERY RAPIDLY.

112
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,455
WE COULD HAVE WAITED AND WE

113
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:19,089
WOULD HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS

114
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:20,390
SUPPORT TO BUILD THE WALL

115
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,992
BECAUSE THEY WANTED IT VERY

116
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:23,026
BADLY IN SAN DIEGO.

117
00:03:23,026 --> 00:03:24,394
WE DECIDED TO GO FORWARD

118
00:03:24,394 --> 00:03:24,761
INSTEAD.

119
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:26,363
WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON

120
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:28,866
THE WALL, BUT NOW WE ARE GOING

121
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:29,600
FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND WE

122
00:03:29,600 --> 00:00:00,000
NEED THE WALL FOR PROTECTION OF
