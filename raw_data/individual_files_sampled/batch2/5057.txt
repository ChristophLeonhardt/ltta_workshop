well look this president is besieged by investigations and all around this president from Scott Pruett the cabinet secretaries that have already resigned we see fantastic levels of corruption type of corruption we haven't seen in this country going back a hundred years and what's increasingly clear whether the target is James Comey whether it's director Muller the Special Counsel the the reality is is this president will burn everything to the ground to protect himself to protect himself from this investigation moving closer to the Oval Office everything he's doing is a strategy of incitement he's trying to harden and incite his base through the most deliberate the most intense misinformation campaign that this country has ever seen this president is a serial liar he is lying to the American people every day he is making up things out of whole cloth he is see really attacking vital institutions that are necessary to the security of the country he will apparently stop at nothing there is a second scandal and that is the complicity of the majority party the Republican Party in the Congress the fact is that there is not one of them not one who will stand up and say that we are a country of laws that no person is above the law that these institutions are vital and necessary and objective truth matters this is propaganda this is what propaganda looks like it's what it smells like we have never seen anything like it what we're seeing is an attack from within on vital institutions like a person body would be attacked by a flesh-eating bacteria and it is unprecedented in America Steve Schmidt let me ask you there's news we started the hour of news that Emmett flood at the table we started the hour the news that Emmett flood one of the president's new lawyers representing him in the Russia probe attended this meeting on Capitol Hill was a gang of eight where there viewed the most sensitive of classified information about a human informant can you imagine any scenario where Alberto Gonzalez or Harriet Miers would have checked in with Pat Fitzgerald who was then investigating the outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame it should never have happened I mean on the one-to-ten scale of inappropriateness it comes in at about a hundred and fifty seven and the in the real issue now is what's the next transgression where's the next time that the Department of Justice backs up because of the whims because of the demands of the of the president we're moving as John Heilemann said closer and closer to the crisis to the critical hour and the rule of law in this country must be defended there's a potential absent any defense of it by leaders in this country that will be living in a very different type of country for two hundred forty plus years the rule of law has held in the United States of America and the spinning of these conspiracy theories the constancy of the attacks the victimization that Trump puts a lot upon himself always blaming someone this nefarious conspiracy this is the hallmark of autocratic leadership back to the beginning of time this is not normal in a democratic republic like the United States and it should be opposed hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
