we mentioned speaker Ryan refusing to place any blame on Donald Trump even saying maybe Trump helped Ryan though of course has a history of dodging tough questions when it comes to Trump I'll defer to the White House on on all those questions mr. speaker are the tweets growing on you do you get what he's doing you know I don't actually see them all I dip eclis don't quote or comment on the tweet of the hour the president has said that this this income tax plan will not benefit his family he says believe me it will not how can we believe him though mr. speaker if we can't see the taxes I don't know the answer to your question kill the reality is Ryan could be in some trouble consider his political strategy may not be working to duck questions I mean Nancy Pelosi you can't have that Nancy Pelosi Maxine Waters the only chance she's got to become Speaker is electing Democrats and you know what we don't have a big margin it's just a very small if you I mean they're doing a number in your estate we have to defeat Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters a very low i q individual never see you you ever seen a you ever seen we will impeach him we will impeach the prep but he hasn't done anything wrong it doesn't matter we will impeach him that was Donald Trump's argument there may be the wake-up call Democrats roaring back into power consider they need 24 seats to retake control of the house and that would deliver with its subpoena power the oversight committees would start doing a whole lot more aggressive oversight of this executive branch now one of the Democrats who would likely be in charge is my special guest here in studio in Washington congressman Adam Schiff welcome to the beat and you join me on a week where the House says they're closing down the probe the Republicans there you spoke out last night many of our viewers saw that presentation where do you go from here well we're gonna be compiling a report on what we know to date all the facts that we've been able to find on key issues going to collusion obstruction going to the Russian hacking and dumping operation of emails their social media campaign but importantly that report will of necessity be incomplete and we'll be setting out just why it's incomplete no the witnesses that we were not allowed to bring in the leads we couldn't follow and what would need to be done to do this incredibly and really get to the truth on a lot of key still unanswered questions you talk about leads I read your investigative update it seemed carefully written but it had some clues one of which was you saying the White House was unresponsive on key questions like not addressing whether recordings memoranda or other documents that any time have existed and the White House would have been memorialized conversations between Trump and Comey and then you go on to say that you have quote a good-faith reason to believe the White House does have such documentation memorializing Trump's conversations with director Comey so lordie or not as mr. Comey would say what are you referring to well I'm not referring to tapes we haven't seen any evidence apart the president's own suggestion for whatever reason he made it that there were recordings but there are indications that there were at least some immoral ization of discussions between the president and Comey that would shed light on the issue of obstruction of justice enough for both myself and mr. Conaway on a bipartisan basis to the right to the White House and demand those if not recordings that memoranda and sir can you say whether you're referring specifically to the reported letter that Stephen Miller helped draft about removing Comey certainly if those drafts included a discussion or shed light on meetings between the president to Comey then yes they would be included but you'd want a subpoena Stephen Miller's letter yes yes let me show him talking about this because this has come up in the public forum quite a bit here was Stephen Miller on that question did you write a letter outlining reasons to fire Comey and list the rush investigation is that true here's the problem with what you're saying the final drafted letter the one that was I'm not talking about that one I'm talking about the one that the file is drafted the letter has the same line about the fact that there is a Trump Russia investigation that this has nothing to do with so it was just moved from the top to the bottom no is it no look at the letter it's at the beginning what more do you want to know about that letter is there anything problematic there well as certainly we have no idea what was in the draft that after the lawyers looked at it and they may have concluded okay this is problematic because it suggests that the president may have had an illicit motive for getting rid of Comey we ought to see what was in the original what was committed and by you absolutely and I know you're careful so you'll comment as you see fit but from what we've learned it almost sounds like Stephen Miller worked with people there around Donald Trump and put an element of obstruction in the original draft of the letter an elicit reason for removing Comey and then under better advise it was later removed is that possible well it's certainly possible we just don't know but we see a pattern within the White House and you can see it reflected in the concoction of that false statement about the Trump Tower where there was a debate going on about what to include and what to exclude and how misleading they could get away with we asked several witnesses that came before a committee about those conversations of those drafts they refused to answer the questions and tragically for us and for the public my GOP colleagues were more than content to take no for an answer and we were never able to compel them to answer those questions hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
