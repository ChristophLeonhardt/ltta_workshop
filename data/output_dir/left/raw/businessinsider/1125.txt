sequence that we choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you</font>

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,730
people I mean you will probably see

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,410
everyone if you're on tinder for long

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,660
enough the question is how we sequence

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,580
it and how we best optimize for your

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,529
time we try to predict who you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">to like and who's going to like you and</font>

11
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,380
we put those potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> people up higher</font>

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,779
in the queue when we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,490
show you and the algorithms that we use

14
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,470
what matters isn't just what you're

15
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,090
looking for what matters<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what the</font>

where that overlaps from a computer

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,430
science<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint that is a very</font>

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,610
complex field of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Technology you think of</font>

20
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,680
search is you know one of the greatest

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,469
innovations in modern time but when

22
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:47,550
you're searching for<font color="#CCCCCC"> something on Google</font>

23
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,850
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> link doesn't have to like you back</font>
