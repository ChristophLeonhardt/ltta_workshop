once upon a time in a land far far away
live many happy citizens waiting for
Christmas Day everyone but one man a man
in a two-season Trevor Phillips he
didn't even have a reason and others
enough this has to stop
and Trevor Len said they'll get up on
Christmas morning just to be dead trevor
was mad travel was upset Trevor wanted
revenge
I'm he'll get it in fed so on he went to
buy bombs at his local ammunation take
as many as you like the shopkeeper being
complacent
Trevor then went on driving in his old
worn down truck wishing all people or
Santos the best battle luck walking to
every door travel and took out his
weapons damn all of you I hope you feel
threatened
hahahahahaha lifeline is almost done who
would want to celebrate Christmas now
that's right absolutely no one they'll
get up on Christmas morning and open
their doors to be killed instantly
thinking there's been some new Wars The
Grinch finally won Christmas that's what
they'll say Trevor Phillips will be
crowned the new king of LA the Grinch
then went on home and snuck into his
beds with a big huge smile on his face
as he rest his sweet head

glad I teach those crazy Christmas
lovers a lesson

terrible Christmas everyone is having
