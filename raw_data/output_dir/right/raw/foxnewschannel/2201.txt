1
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:04,659
HE PLEADED GUILTY TO LYING TO

2
00:00:04,659 --> 00:00:07,128
THE FBI AS PART OF THE RUSSIAN

3
00:00:07,128 --> 00:00:11,433
MIDDLING PROBE.

4
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:12,167
WITH THE MUELLER PROBE LEAKING

5
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:16,872
LIKE A FAUCET, WHERE SHOULD THE

6
00:00:16,872 --> 00:00:17,539
INVESTIGATION GO FROM HERE?

7
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,307
JIM HANSEN, THANKS FOR JOINING

8
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:25,180
US, WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:25,881
A COUPLE BIG LEAKS, ALL THESE

10
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:26,982
QUESTIONS THAT WERE LEAKED

11
00:00:26,982 --> 00:00:27,682
REGARDING QUESTIONS THAT WERE

12
00:00:27,682 --> 00:00:31,186
ALLEGEDLY GOING TO BE ASKED TO

13
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:32,954
DONALD TRUMP.

14
00:00:32,954 --> 00:00:37,926
>> THE MUELLER PROBE NEEDS TO GO

15
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:40,028
HOME.

16
00:00:40,028 --> 00:00:40,762
MUELLER HASN'T FOUND ANYTHING,

17
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:41,496
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THE ONE

18
00:00:41,496 --> 00:00:45,901
THING HE WAS GIVEN A HUNTING

19
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:46,635
LICENSE TO LOOK FOR AND THAT IS

20
00:00:46,635 --> 00:00:47,636
COLLUSION BETWEEN THE PRES. AND

21
00:00:47,636 --> 00:00:54,542
THE RUSSIANS IN THE 2016

22
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:54,910
ELECTION.

23
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,544
HE IS NOT GOING TO FIND

24
00:00:56,544 --> 00:00:56,912
ANYTHING.

25
00:00:56,912 --> 00:00:57,579
HE IS CONTINUING TO HASSLE

26
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:58,313
ANYONE WHO KNOWS THE PRES. AND

27
00:00:58,313 --> 00:01:01,383
SOME OF THEM GUILTY OF PETTY

28
00:01:01,383 --> 00:01:04,852
CRIMES BUT NONE OF IT BASED ON

29
00:01:04,852 --> 00:01:08,723
HIS ACTUAL JOB.

30
00:01:08,723 --> 00:01:09,491
HEATHER: WHAT ABOUT THE LIST OF

31
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:10,492
PROPOSED QUESTIONS?

32
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:11,226
THIS WILL INCLUDE MICHAEL FLYNN,

33
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:14,863
JAMES COMEY, COORDINATION WITH

34
00:01:14,863 --> 00:01:15,597
RUSSIA, 52 QUESTIONS TOTAL AND

35
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:25,674
IF YOU

36
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:36,885
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING WARRANTING

37
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:37,218
MY TIME.

38
00:01:37,218 --> 00:01:39,421
I KNOW HE WANTS TO CONFRONT HIS

39
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:40,722
ACCUSER AND CONFRONT THIS

40
00:01:40,722 --> 00:01:41,790
INSPECTOR HASSLING HIM FOR A

41
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:53,668
YEAR BUT NEEDS TO REMEMBER THE

42
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:56,705
PRESIDENCY IS WELL ABOVE MUELLER

43
00:01:56,705 --> 00:01:57,405
AND GO AHEAD AND NOT TALK TO

44
00:01:57,405 --> 00:01:58,139
HIM, TELL HIM HE HAS 30 DAYS TO

45
00:01:58,139 --> 00:01:58,873
DROP ANY INDICTMENTS HE MAY HAVE

46
00:01:58,873 --> 00:02:00,709
AND THEN PACK HIS BAGS AND GO.

47
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:01,443
HEATHER: WHAT ABOUT THE LEAK OF

48
00:02:01,443 --> 00:02:02,110
THIS THREAT FROM MUELLER TO

49
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:02,677
SUBPOENA DONALD TRUMP.

50
00:02:02,677 --> 00:02:05,447
WHAT IF THAT HAPPENS?

51
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:06,181
>> THAT IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD

52
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:07,582
POSITIVELY BE IGNORED.

53
00:02:07,582 --> 00:02:17,392
THE PRESIDENCY, THE CHIEF

54
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:18,093
EXECUTIVE OF OUR GOVERNMENT,

55
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:20,729
MUELLER IS A CONTRACT EMPLOYEE

56
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:21,329
OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

57
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:22,063
IF CONGRESS WANTS TO DEAL WITH

58
00:02:22,063 --> 00:02:22,931
THIS THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND DROP

59
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:23,665
SOME ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT IF

60
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:24,733
THERE'S A CRIME BUT THE

61
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:25,433
PRESIDENT DOES NOT JUMP JUST

62
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:29,771
BECAUSE SOME SPECIAL PROSECUTOR

63
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:31,406
SAYS.

64
00:02:31,406 --> 00:02:32,140
HEATHER: THE SECOND TOPIC, THE

65
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,640
MONEY AND HE RAN.

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,715
THIS IS WHAT I WAS THINKING

67
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:41,416
ABOUT WHEN BENJAMIN NETANYAHU

68
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,150
TALKED ABOUT EVIDENCE THAT THEY

69
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,884
ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE DEAL, THAT

70
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:46,254
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE

71
00:02:46,254 --> 00:02:46,988
FOLLOWING, PRES. OBAMA HANDED A

72
00:02:46,988 --> 00:02:48,056
LOT OF MONEY OVER THAT WOULD

73
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:53,161
FUNNEL DIRECTLY TO TERRORISTS.

74
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:53,728
WHAT ABOUT THIS MONEY?

75
00:02:53,728 --> 00:02:56,731
WHERE IS IT NOW?

76
00:02:56,731 --> 00:03:01,836
>> IN THE HANDS OF SOME OF THE

77
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:02,504
WORST ACTORS IN THE REGION.

78
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:03,238
HEZBOLLAH GOT IT, HAMAS GOT IT,

79
00:03:03,238 --> 00:03:08,810
THE BAD GUYS IRAN USES AS THEIR

80
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,678
PROXY GOT PAID.

81
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:11,413
OBAMA MADE THE WORST DEAL ANYONE

82
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:12,080
HAS MADE IN MODERN HISTORY.

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,354
HE DIDN'T GET HIS LUNCH MONEY

84
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:20,055
TAKEN BY THE MUELLERS ON THE

85
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:20,722
PLAYGROUND BUT GAVE WAY HIS

86
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:21,356
PARENTS MORTGAGE AND OUR

87
00:03:21,356 --> 00:03:21,723
SECURITY.

88
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:24,459
DONALD TRUMP IS RIGHT TO KILL

89
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:24,826
THIS DEAL.

90
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:25,560
HEATHER: THIS $1.7 BILLION CASH

91
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,765
PAYMENT MADE TO IRAN BY THE

92
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:31,433
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, $150

93
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:35,904
BILLION IN UNFROZEN URANIAN

94
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:36,704
ASSETS THANKS TO THE IRAN DEAL?

95
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:40,041
>> ALL THIS MONEY NEVER MADE IT

96
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,543
TO ANYTHING USEFUL IN IRAN.

97
00:03:41,543 --> 00:03:47,615
THE PEOPLE IN IRAN CAN'T BUY A

98
00:03:47,615 --> 00:03:48,349
DOZEN EGGS FOR LESS THAN THAT,

99
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:49,050
THEIR CURRENCY IS COLLAPSING,

100
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,254
THE MUELLERS AND GRAND AYATOLLAH

101
00:03:53,254 --> 00:04:00,128
HAVE BEEN SHOVELING THIS MANY TO

102
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,829
THEIR OFFSHORE BANK ACCOUNTS,

103
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:01,529
ALL OBAMA DID WAS MAKE THINGS

104
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:01,830
WORSE.

105
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,564
DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO TAKE THIS

106
00:04:02,564 --> 00:04:03,531
DEAL ON THE EAST LAWN, BURN IT

107
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:05,400
AND JOHN BOLTON AND SARAH

108
00:04:05,400 --> 00:00:00,000
SANDERS CAN GET AROUND IT AND
