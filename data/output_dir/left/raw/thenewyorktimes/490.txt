1
00:00:10,334 --> 00:00:13,167
They’re always asking, “Why Ghazala Mhamdi?”

2
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:19,959
There are no women who work in politics and unions.

3
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:22,459
And from Gafsa, a woman from Gafsa!

4
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:24,083


5
00:00:27,334 --> 00:00:30,042
I grew up here in the mining basin. 

6
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:30,042
During Ben Ali’s era, the ruling party had complete control.

7
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:36,000
He would hire all his own people

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,667
even in the phosphate company in Gafsa.

9
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:42,334
The rich got richer 

10
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,917
and the poor remained poor. 

11
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:51,459
I founded the Union for the Unemployed in Gafsa in 2005.

12
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:54,917
I was beaten up for the sake of this committee.

13
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:58,834
On Jan. 5, 2008,

14
00:00:58,834 --> 00:01:02,459
a group of mothers organized a sit-in.

15
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:03,751
Things erupted and there were serious protests.

16
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:04,459
Things erupted and there were serious protests.

17
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,250
Things erupted and there were serious protests.

18
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:11,917
The regime resorted to shooting at the protesters.

19
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:14,667
Four young people were killed. 

20
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:17,083
Everyone agrees the 2008 protests

21
00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:25,375
were the first nail in the coffin of the Ben Ali regime.

22
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:28,417
Freedom!

23
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:31,042
My bones were broken and my mouth was broken and my knee was broken,

24
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:31,042
but I didn’t back down.

25
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:37,083
I stayed on the street and kept fighting. 

26
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:43,209


27
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:48,167


28
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:49,042
It was a huge shock when the Islamist Ennahda party

29
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:55,709
won the first elections after the revolution. 

30
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:58,334
Ennahda has a retrograde view when it comes to women

31
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:00,751
and I am a strong feminist. 

32
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:05,626
The shock was that after removing a dictator like Ben Ali,

33
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,792
that women would go backwards 50 years!

34
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:13,917
After all that,

35
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:16,792
I decided to run for Parliament.

36
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:22,167
Our party is called Keeping the Promise.

37
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:26,459
The red flower represents the blood of those who died in the revolution.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,292
This is an independent party.

39
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:34,834
We tried to make it representative of the unemployed, men and women.

40
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:36,834
As you can see, everyone here is unemployed.

41
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:39,167
I am trying to win to be their voice.

42
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:41,792
Make our voice heard for the sake of our sons.

43
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,167
I promise you so.

44
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:47,792
When I couldn’t find a job, I went on a hunger strike for 19 days.

45
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:52,626
Ghazala, how many times did the police hit her in the street?

46
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:55,334
Ghazala is the queen of resistance!

47
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:09,009


48
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:11,834
Today is Election Day.

49
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:14,542
I’m here to vote for myself

50
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,500
and may God grant me success.

51
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:32,042
I am the voice of the hungry, poor child.

52
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:39,417
I am the voice of the worker in the government and the farms.

53
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:41,667
I am the voice of the unemployed.

54
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,209
I am the voice of the women.

55
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,626
Whatever happens to me, it’s not important.

56
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,500
The important thing is to try to amplify their voices.

57
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:52,751
I did my best.

58
00:03:52,751 --> 00:04:02,751
I entered a strong battle and competed with 57 men.

59
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,626
It was a tight competition,

60
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:09,459
and the rest is up to God. 

61
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,626


62
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:18,667


63
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,584


64
00:04:21,584 --> 00:00:00,000
