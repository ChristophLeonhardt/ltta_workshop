Italian restaurant near the Capitol in DC and they were met with some activists and situation escalated quickly let's take a look he forgot to validate yeah and by the way now he protects his wife right no in Trump's attacking area he bowed his head so we might have a debate on our hands on this issue because I don't I don't think we agree necessarily but just so you know he did try to stay at the restaurant in the beginning when they were just asking him questions but when the chanting began that's when he started to run for the hills which is his trademark so just in case you know it was difficult to understand what they were chanting and what this whole protest was about it started with one of the protesters asking from what I gather politely how he plans on voting in the hole Brett Kavanaugh confirmation and then they started chanting we believe the survivors as you can hear in that video and so yeah look some people are uncomfortable with it because they believe that this is another example of Americans being uncivil and that we should be polite to one another but here's the thing I would buy that argument if it weren't so one-sided because we are dealing with lawmakers and specifically a president who go out of their way to be uncivil toward the voters toward the American people they do it through policy they do it through rhetoric and so the only part of this that makes me uncomfortable is he's with his wife you know she's not a politician and it makes me uncomfortable to see her harassed if he were alone it would be perfect and I'd have no problem with it whatsoever I mean what kind of country do we live in when the Zodiac killer can't just hold peaceful dinner father killed Kennedy he's trying to have a simple dinner with his wife before he goes in votes to jam through a sexual assaulting Supreme Court nominee what kind of country yeah okay so I hear you guys and I'm actually gonna go connect this to money in politics you know and I'll tell you how let me see what but then I'm gonna go okay so if you suppress the people long enough they're eventually going to burst out like this so they don't care about their voters at all and I don't mean Republicans I mean the whole system that they they all take donor money and they all do exactly what the donors ask and then they expect you to bow your head politely and just take your beating and and the fact that we're run by a bunch of oligarchs now and and the perfect example of that is Ted Cruz because Ted Cruz had the the Mercer said who had given him a thirteen million dollars in the Republican primaries you tell me he wasn't bought by the Mercer's well if you're told don't say that because I'm about to prove you're wrong so he then goes into into the Trump convention and says I'm not endorsing Trump right so then he goes to a same exact night right after the speech he goes up to the suite that the Mercer's have at the top of the convention which of course they do right because they've now switched and they're now backing Donald Trump because he won the denomination and the merger slammed the door in his face that's why he then went in phonebank for Donald Trump and the guy who said oh he insulted my wife and he insulted my dad and he's a sniveling coward and I'm gonna go get him etc said oh the donors told me not to so I'm just now gonna bow my head and he's pathetic and so this is the voters getting frustrated and saying well dammit if you're not gonna listen to my votes you're at least gonna listen to my voice right so I completely empathize for all those reasons but I am worried that it's gonna get out of hand and so I think that if we start especially with family but even an on family I mean so they we're doing it to Republicans they're gonna do it to Democrats and they were okay with it now because Cruz is the Zodiac killer and and he's one of the worst guys even a conservative columnist today wrote or recently wrote a column saying he's like a serpent covered in Vaseline but be careful if you say so cadence do it to Ted Cruz how are you gonna feel if they do to Elizabeth Warren I'm curious about what those what would that chance sound like like how dare you stand up for women how dare you not trying to stop on poisoning the water stop poisoning the water yeah I do a good point I could see them doing it I'm just curious if one but you know how the right ways you know they're gonna start chanting Pocahontas yeah and then and and they're not gonna have any boundaries and so that's oh look we're gonna ask you guys tea y-t-dot-com size poll should activist yell at political figures in restaurants and so obviously you'll have yes so knows the options there again I'm super curious we asked you guys about whether dr. Blasi Ford should testified and I didn't know which way you were going to go and 80% of you said yes she should testify even though she's gonna be subjected to these probably unfair questions etc and but in this case I'm I'm still too uncomfortable with it you want to ask him questions like the questions they asked on his way in are you're supporting Cavanaugh you're a citizen you can ask anybody any questions right I think once they sit down surrounding them that's and chanting I don't know I think the way that they handled it was fine again I wish his wife wasn't there but come on I'm so tired of being held at a different standard we're always held at a different standard okay like there's one tiny tiny protest of a conservative speaker and any event and people like oh my god free speech the right wing loses its mind right so in this case it's free speech this is politically protected speech okay I don't agree with people protesting on college campuses and and you know preventing others from speaking if they disagree with them and I disagree with those who disagree with or criticize what the protesters did here they are voicing their opinion and you're right people are angry they're frustrated and conventional methods of getting through to these politicians has not worked that's I just have to get that out I I hear you guys so yeah it's right now two to one the voting goes and I am amused by your chant ideas for Bernie I guess it would be like don't give us health care don't give us let me be sick I wanna die right like what you see click the subscribe button below and don't forget to ring the bell to never miss another video from the Young Turks
