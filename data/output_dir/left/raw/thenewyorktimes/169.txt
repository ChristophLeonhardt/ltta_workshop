00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,920
Hi.

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,670
I’m Ari Aster, and I
am the writer/director

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,680
of “Hereditary."

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,109
This is the opening
shot of the film.

5
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,800
We are opening on an image
of the treehouse, which

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,920
is a significant
monument in the film.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,810
When we were on set
we were actually

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,030
shooting a green screen
outside of this window,

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,680
because that
treehouse is actually

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,350
a plate because we built
the entire set on a stage.

11
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,870
So the entire house
was built from scratch.

12
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,259
We’re panning away
now to reveal that we

13
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,890
are inside Annie’s workshop.

14
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,710
Annie is a character
played by Toni Collette.

15
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,300
And in this space she
builds miniature replicas

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,790
of spaces in her life.

17
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,840
And the miniatures always
sort of served as a metaphor

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,490
for the family’s
situation in this film,

19
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,090
which is that they are
people with no agency

20
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,960
and they’re revealed
to be like dolls

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,610
in a dollhouse
being manipulated

22
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,380
by outside forces.

23
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,420
So now we have landed on
the Graham house miniature.

24
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,330
And this is meant to
basically function

25
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:16,270
as a replica of the house
that we are in right now.

26
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,710
And so we needed to design
everything well in advance

27
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,980
of shooting so that we
could get a miniaturist,

28
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,470
Steve Newburn — who also
did our prosthetics —

29
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,092
to replicate everything
by the time we

30
00:01:29,092 --> 00:01:30,050
were ready to shoot it.

31
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,350
So we were replicating
things before they were

32
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,510
built in the first place.

33
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,270
And here we actually had
to use tracking markers

34
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,370
on the miniature
room and shoot

35
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,530
a separate plate of
Peter’s actual room

36
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,210
with the wall removed.

37
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:50,150
And then we had the wonderful
VFX artists at Brainstorm.

38
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,010
They did a beautiful job
of seamlessly incorporating

39
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,690
that plate into
this shot so that it

40
00:01:55,690 --> 00:00:00,000
looks as though Peter’s
actual bedroom is a miniature.
