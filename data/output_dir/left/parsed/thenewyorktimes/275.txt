Thank you guys
all for coming.
We're part of many
walkouts happening
across the nation.
We're going to do 
17 minutes
for every life
lost in the
Stoneman shooting.
Then we're going to 
do an extra minute
for Courtlin, who was
the newest victim
of gun violence.
We hope that today
will be remembered
not as a day of
strife and conflict,
but one of togetherness
and understanding.
It is our time as a generation
to stand up and revamp
the status quo, to
change the unchangeable
and advocate for what is right.
We are the true silent majority.
And we will no longer be silent.
In the last 1,870 days there
had been 1,624 mass shootings
in the U.S.A. 
America the great, right?
Home of the brave.
Also home of the AR-15s.
The children 
were not saved.
President wanting
teachers to be armed.
Teachers who are 
overworked and underpaid.
They’re the ones who
are paving our ways.
Now they gotta hold guns?
Jan. 30, 2006. Goleta, 
Calif. Seven killed.
Oct. 26. Lancaster County,
Pennsylvania. Five killed.
Feb. 12, 2007. Salt Lake City,
Utah. Five killed.
April 16, 2007.
Blacksburg, Va. 32 killed.
Many wounded.
If I could please get a 
moment of silence,
we're going to read
the 17 names of
the kids who died
in the shooting.
We’re going to start
with Nicholas Dworet,
who was 17 
years old.
Aaron Feis, who
was 37.
Jaime Guttenberg
was only 14.
Jaime Guttenberg, 14.
Chris Hixon.
Luke Hoyer.
We are calling on Congress
to ban assault weapons,
to close the loophole
in background checks,
make schools safer and
make sure that we can live
our lives without
the fear of being
taken by a gun
every single day.
Newtown High School, 
if you've had enough
of gun violence, 
use your voice.
