I REMEMBER BLOCKBUSTER WHEN WE TRIED TO SET UP IN CHINA AND

29
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,602
TRIED TO SET UP IN CHINA AND THERE WERE ALL KIND OF BARRIERS.

30
00:01:08,637 --> 00:01:10,370
THERE WERE ALL KIND OF BARRIERS. THERE ARE CERTAINLY BARRIERS

31
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:11,905
THERE ARE CERTAINLY BARRIERS THAT NEED TO BE DEALT WITH.

32
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,940
THAT NEED TO BE DEALT WITH. AT DUNKIN’, WE ARE WATCHING THE

33
00:01:13,975 --> 00:01:14,808
AT DUNKIN’, WE ARE WATCHING THE TRADE WAR CLOSELY.

TARIFFS AND MOVE OUR PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD.

00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:40,801
AROUND THE WORLD. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CERTAINLY

48
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:43,103
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CERTAINLY CONCERNS US IS THE TRANSPACIFIC

49
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:43,437

00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:48,843
OPPORTUNITY -- >> TPP, WHICH PRESIDENT OBAMA

00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:52,346
PUT FORWARD. >> WE THINK IT WOULD HAVE HELPED

55
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,381
>> WE THINK IT WOULD HAVE HELPED US EXPORT MORE ICE CREAM AROUND

56
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:54,849
US EXPORT MORE ICE CREAM AROUND THE WORLD.

57
00:01:54,883 --> 00:01:57,085
THE WORLD. WE ARE GOING TO REMOVE THE

58
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,619
WE ARE GOING TO REMOVE THE TARIFF BARRIERS WE ARE FACING.

59
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:00,621
TARIFF BARRIERS WE ARE FACING. >> THE CENTER THESIS IS

60
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:02,723
>> THE CENTER THESIS IS COMPANIES NEED TO PUSH BACK TO

61
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:04,759
COMPANIES NEED TO PUSH BACK TO PUSH FORWARD.

62
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:05,093
PUSH FORWARD. >> YES.

>> AS IT RELATES TO GOVERNMENT POLICY, IS THIS A TIME COMPANIES

65
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:12,566
POLICY, IS THIS A TIME COMPANIES NEED TO STEP IN AND PUSH IN

66
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:12,867
NEED TO STEP IN AND PUSH IN POLICY?

67
00:02:12,902 --> 00:02:14,936
POLICY? NIKE TAKING A POLITICAL STAND.

68
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,171
NIKE TAKING A POLITICAL STAND. THAT’S A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE

69
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:18,272
THAT’S A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE THAN CORPORATE AMERICA HAS BEEN

70
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:19,106
THAN CORPORATE AMERICA HAS BEEN IN THE PAST.

71
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:20,074
IN THE PAST. >> ABSOLUTELY.

72
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:21,876
>> ABSOLUTELY. ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK

73
00:02:21,877 --> 00:02:23,745
ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK DUNKIN’ HAS BEEN A LEADER IS

74
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:25,480
DUNKIN’ HAS BEEN A LEADER IS PUSHING BACK AN VARIOUS

75
00:02:25,514 --> 00:02:27,382
PUSHING BACK AN VARIOUS ADMINISTRATION, BE IT OBAMA

76
00:02:27,383 --> 00:02:29,150
ADMINISTRATION, BE IT OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OR THE CURRENT

77
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:29,650
ADMINISTRATION OR THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION.

78
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:31,285
ADMINISTRATION. I THINK BOTH ADMINISTRATIONS, WE

79
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:32,787
I THINK BOTH ADMINISTRATIONS, WE HAVE WORKED EXTREMELY HARD.

80
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:34,856
HAVE WORKED EXTREMELY HARD. I HAVE BEEN DOWN TO WASHINGTON

81
00:02:34,857 --> 00:02:36,991
I HAVE BEEN DOWN TO WASHINGTON PROBABLY FIVE OR SIX TIMES A

82
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:37,291
PROBABLY FIVE OR SIX TIMES A YEAR.

83
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:39,394
YEAR. I THINK WE WERE VERY INVOLVED IN

84
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:42,163
I THINK WE WERE VERY INVOLVED IN THE TAX BILL WHEN IT WENT

85
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:42,497
THE TAX BILL WHEN IT WENT THROUGH.

86
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:44,332
THROUGH. TRYING TO PUT THE CASE FOR SMALL

87
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:45,400
TRYING TO PUT THE CASE FOR SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE.

88
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:47,769
BUSINESS PEOPLE. I THINK PUSHBACKS ARE A GREAT

89
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:49,871
I THINK PUSHBACKS ARE A GREAT WAY OF PUTTING IT.

90
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:51,606
WAY OF PUTTING IT. ONE THING PEOPLE DON’T REALIZE

91
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:53,708
ONE THING PEOPLE DON’T REALIZE IS GOVERNMENT IS MUCH MORE

92
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:55,410
IS GOVERNMENT IS MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES,

93
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:56,711
ACCESSIBLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES, EVEN MY HOME COUNTRY.

94
00:02:56,712 --> 00:02:58,913
EVEN MY HOME COUNTRY. AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE INFLUENCE.

95
00:02:58,948 --> 00:03:02,617
AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE INFLUENCE. WE CERTAINLY HAD INFLUENCE ON

00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:04,219
WE CERTAINLY HAD INFLUENCE ON MANY LABELING THAT WENT ON FOR

97
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,655
MANY LABELING THAT WENT ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

98
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,823
SEVERAL YEARS. I DON’T THINK ENOUGH CEOs,

99
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:10,892
I DON’T THINK ENOUGH CEOs, ENOUGH COMPANIES HAVE

100
00:03:10,893 --> 00:03:12,026
ENOUGH COMPANIES HAVE CONSTRUCTIVE, THAT’S THE POINT

101
00:03:12,028 --> 00:03:14,329
CONSTRUCTIVE, THAT’S THE POINT OF THE BOOK, IT’S ABOUT

102
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,298
OF THE BOOK, IT’S ABOUT CONSTRUCTIVE, POSITIVE, CIVIL

103
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:18,133
CONSTRUCTIVE, POSITIVE, CIVIL DISCUSSION.

104
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:22,871
DISCUSSION. >> WITHOUT RESPECT AND SICIVILIT

105
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:23,738
>> WITHOUT RESPECT AND SICIVILIT WE HAVE NOTHING.

106
00:03:23,773 --> 00:03:25,773
WE HAVE NOTHING. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT DUNKIN’ IS

107
00:03:25,808 --> 00:03:30,812
WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT DUNKIN’ IS YOU ARE A BIG COMPANY OF SMALL

108

COMPANIES. DO YOU THINK THE LITTLE GUY

00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:35,650
DO YOU THINK THE LITTLE GUY HASN’T BEEN REWARDS, WHAT DO YOU

00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:35,951
HASN’T BEEN REWARDS, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

112
00:03:35,985 --> 00:03:37,853
THINK? >> THERE’S DISCUSSION ABOUT

113
00:03:37,854 --> 00:03:38,153
>> THERE’S DISCUSSION ABOUT WAGES.

114
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:39,788
WAGES. I THINK IT WAS GOOD FOR SMALL

115
00:03:39,822 --> 00:03:40,522
I THINK IT WAS GOOD FOR SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE.

116
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:42,657
BUSINESS PEOPLE. WE PUSHED FOR THE TAX CUT.

117
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:48,029
WE PUSHED FOR THE TAX CUT. WE PUSHED FOR THE SMALL

118
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:48,363
WE PUSHED FOR THE SMALL ENTITIES.

119
00:03:48,398 --> 00:03:51,433
ENTITIES. REMEMBER, WE ARE 100% FRANCHISE.

120
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:54,169
REMEMBER, WE ARE 100% FRANCHISE. MY PREVIOUS COMPANY, PAPA JOHNS

121
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:56,171
MY PREVIOUS COMPANY, PAPA JOHNS WERE VERY MUCH FRANCHISE.

122
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:57,773
WERE VERY MUCH FRANCHISE. WE REPRESENT SMALL BUSINESS IN

00:03:57,774 --> 00:03:58,107
WE REPRESENT SMALL BUSINESS IN AMERICA.

124
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:00,475
AMERICA. WE MANAGED TO GET THAT MESSAGE

125
00:04:00,477 --> 00:00:00,000
WE MANAGED TO GET THAT MESSAGE OVER TO GOVERNMENT.
