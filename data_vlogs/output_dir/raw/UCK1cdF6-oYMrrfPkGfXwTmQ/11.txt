I don't need all the money in the world. I don't need Lamborghinis. I don't need views. I don't need subscribers

173
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,149
I really don't I don't care. I'm sorry

174
00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:00,279
I'm sorry, but I don't know but what you really do need in life is people that love you surround yourself with people

175
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:06,789
Love you, and do things that make you happy for example Gossip Girl pizza, and I love my boyfriend

176
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,949

Hi

00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:30,428
I'm sorry. I'm just I'm so in love with my boyfriend. I can't again. I'm so happy or not good

181
00:12:30,429 --> 00:00:00,000
I've honestly genuinely never been this happy about a little hot. This is getting weird. I gotta go bye
