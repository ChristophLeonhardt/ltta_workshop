so last week Gizmodo reported that former Facebook employees finally admitted what we conservatives always tacitly knew that the company used leftist editorial procedures to tamp down all the trending conservative topics and disadvantaged stories from conservative websites here is Gizmodo quote several former Facebook News curators as they were known internally told Gizmodo they were instructed to artificially inject selected stories into the trending news module even if they weren't popular enough to warrant inclusion or in some cases if they weren't trending at all among the deep sixed or suppressed topics on the list former IRS official Lois Lerner who was accused by Republicans of inappropriately scrutinizing conservative groups wisconsin Governor Scott Walker popular news aggregator The Drudge Report Chris Kyle and former Fox News contributor Stephen Crowder stories covered by conservative outlets including Breitbart Washington Examiner and News Matt that were trending enough to be picked up by the algorithm they were excluded unless mainstream sites like the New York Times and the BBC and CNN also covered the same story so now Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has invited a bevy of conservatives to meet with him in Menlo Park California to chat about all of this even though his top level employees have denied the accusations look conservatives have pretty good reason to attend with a list of demands demands like Facebook committing to an objective algorithm for choosing trending topics Facebook seizing discrimination against conservatives and conservative outlets Facebook we're dressing it's past bias against prominent Facebook conservatives like steven crowder and that a dollar spent by a conservative on facebook should be treated in exactly the exact same way as a dollar spent by a leftist on facebook marketing the meeting in other words is worth while so long as conservatives going with a real agenda but naturally pro-trump websites like Breitbart news and The Drudge Report and Gateway pundit they've chosen to lie about the nature of the conservatives going to the meeting instead now all of those outlets have a pretty good reason to be skeptical of Facebook's motives all conservatives should be and several of those outlets at least two of them were named there but the meeting isn't about Donald Trump nonetheless here are the headlines about the Facebook meeting from those pro Trump web sites gateway pundit quote Facebook founder Zuckerberg to meet with conservatives this week but only anti Trump conservatives Breitbart news Glenn Beck anti Trump conservatives too with Facebook Zuckerberg Drudge Report linked to Breitbart and here was their headline anti-trump quote-unquote conservatives in facebook meet up it's a conspiracy and just like all the other anti Trump conspiracies the elections being stolen in the media that gave from two billion dollars in free media wanted to stop him from winning the nomination and it's the Jews just like all of those other conservative supposedly pro Trump conspiracy theories it's nonsense the hill reported this morning quote Barry Bennett a senior adviser to the term campaign will represent Trump during the meeting on Wednesday by the way those of us who had heard about the meeting knew Bennett had been invited long before the hill reported it and Breitbart news was invited to but this all must have been just some big anti Trump conspiracy see this is how the Trump movement worked they take issues that are important to conservatives and then they pervert them into litmus tests about the orange god-king in the process that let the apparent bad guys in this case facebook off the hook and they split conservatives into pro Trump and anti Trump factions all for publicity all for political gain and then as a capper those like conman Steven K ban and a Breitbart news of whom Trump says quote if Steve is involved it will be good they say they're just turning down the invite because quote free speech is not for sale and neither are we uh-huh I'm Ben Shapiro and this is the Ben Shapiro show to demonize people don't care about your feelings alright so it was a busy weekend and there's lots of amusing Trump material to get to and a lot of amusing stuff on the Democratic side to get to everybody's focused on the never Trump movement less people seem to be focused on the number Hillary movement among folks on the Left Bernie Sanders his crowd is not thrilled with Hillary Clinton we will get to all of that but we start today with this late-breaking news Breitbart Sunday night wrote a piece they put up a piece that looked like this it looked like this and the headline if you can't read it folks cuz you're not subscribed first of all you should subscribe so you can see everything we're doing it makes the show twice as awesome and three times is wonderful and that's an exact calculation the the headline says Bill Kristol Republican spoiler renegade jus prepares third party effort to block Trump's path to the White House this was the big headline over a breitbart.com a renegade Jew oh and we run again Jews were somewhat perturbed by this the peace was written by a former boss of mine David Horowitz so this is two former employers of mine getting together to do something deeply terrible and stupid so let's first go through the piece that David Horowitz wrote and then we'll get to why Breitbart does stuff like this and there is an incipient a nascent anti-semitic movement inside the Trump camp we've been talking about it for months here and this is just more evidence that it's being pandered to by folks at Breitbart I'm kind of surprised at David because the reality is that the David trying to call people out on their Judaism is a little bit weird so here's the thing I'm Orthodox see this this means I'm Orthodox the funny hat on my head that means I'm an Orthodox Jew I've worn a yarmulke every single waking hour essentially unless I'm showering or sleeping well then I wouldn't be awake but every single waking hour I've been wearing this yarmulke since I was about 11 I was married in Israel my wife is Israeli American she became a citizen about four years ago on Saturday we held the breat me law bris for my baby right and all the Trump supporters spammed me after they found out about the birth with with nasty antes medic material because this is what a lot of Trump supporters do I've spent my career fighting boycotts investment sanctions from Israel I'm a leading critic of the Obama administration I'm the first person in America to call them anti-semitic and anti-jewish okay I haven't been shy about calling out Jews who I think are siding with the with the bad guys in the political scene I wrote a column now it's been five years probably called Jews in name only about Jews who don't care about Israel and vote based on abortion and same-sex marriage I also don't back Donald Trump and as if you've been watching this show or listening to it you know why don't pat Donald Trump but on a Jewish basis I don't back him because I feel no compulsion as a Jew to back a man who said an open debate he makes no moral distinction between the Israelis and the Palestinians who feigns ignorance of the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke who refuses to rip up the Iran deal he's one of only two candidates in the Republican race who refused to say that they would rip up the Iran deal who flirts with the anti-semite Hitler loving people on Twitter who refuses to denounce anti-semitic death threats against journalists who refuses to stand by religious freedom restoration act that would protect Jews and Christians who treats women like garbage and lies non-stop shifts his positions off time and insult the disabled in POWs sorry as a Jew this doesn't seem like it's indicative that I must support that guy Hilary's terrible for Israel she's terrible for the Jews Trump is terrible for Israel he's also terrible for the Jews what's worse is that Trump is carving the heart out of the only pro-israel party the Republican Party he's carving the heart out of it and replacing it with this heart of stone of Pat Buchanan is this isolationist anti-israel anti-jewish policy but according to David Horowitz you're running a Jew if you don't back Trump so the whole article is specious it's really not a good article at Breitbart but the the last paragraph is the one that that where he talks about why he's talking about Bill Kristol being a renegade Jew for trying to start a third party here's what he writes he says I am a Jew who has never been to Israel and has never been a Zionist in the sense of believing that Jews can rid themselves of Jew hatred by having their own nation-state okay first of all if David Horowitz truly believes that that's what Zionism is he doesn't understand tsiyon ISM so right off the bat he's disqualified himself okay Zionism was never about the idea that once there was a Jewish state everybody would leave the Jews alone Zionism was about the idea that no one would ever leave Jews alone including when there was a Jewish state so you need a Jewish state so people have a place to go when they don't leave Jews alone right that's what it was about it was founded by it by Theodor Herzl on that basis after the trial of Dreyfus in France Zionism is about the idea that Jews will be persecuted everywhere so they need a homeland somewhere that's what Zionism is about so he's wrong on that right off the bat Horowitz continued says half of world Jewry now lives in Israel the enemies whom Obama and Hillary have empowered Iran the Muslim Brotherhood Hezbollah Isis and Hamas have openly sworn to exterminate the Jews okay I'm with you I'm also an American and an American first who's country is threatened with destruction by the same enemies to weaken the only party that stands between the Jews in their annihilation when between America and the forces intent on destroying her is a political miscalculation so great and a betrayal so profound as to not be easily forgiven so I agree with all of that I just think that the people who are carving the heart out of the Republican Party for Donald Trump's benefit those are the people who are weakening the only party that stands between us and the brink beyond this and I want to get personal with David when he calls people renegade Jews it's sort of necessary David's an avowed agnostic right I mean David doesn't believe in God David doesn't believe in the Torah David doesn't believe in the Pentateuch he doesn't but that doesn't none that makes him a bad person but it certainly makes it weird that he's standing on the Moses Mountain holding the tablet I'm sorry you don't get to do the really and it doesn't make you a renegade Jew you know to not back Trump it actually sort of makes you a renegade you to reject every fundamental basis of Judaism and then say well as a Jew X you can say as a westerner I don't like I think the Trump will be better for Israel then then anybody else but did the whole as a Jew thing when you don't believe in Judaism it's a little bit awkward okay so that's David's article then there's Breitbart so these are two different things David writes a piece and David sort of assumes because I think David is not internet sophisticated he assumes that Breitbart is what Breitbart was Breitbart is not what it was bright part is now an alt right white supremacist pandering site and that makes me super sad to say because I was involved deeply in Breitbart to rise I still have love for Andrew Breitbart and his family of course there's still people who are working there who I once considered friends all the less of them now and then Breitbart has become a sight that specifically panders to the sorts of people who see a headline like renegade Jews and immediately start tweeting Nazi memes that's that's what Breitbart does now they they openly pan hurts the alt-right my lowly innopolis one of the writers he's a guy who has openly embraced the all right this is what he wrote by the way he said there are many things that separate the alternative right from old-school racist skinheads to whom they are often idiotic ly compared but one thing standed stands out above all else intelligence yes that's very encouraging they're skinheads who are smart now I feel more comfortable this all began and soared the comment section of Breitbart while I was there and while I was there and I was writing anti Trump stuff every comment was about what a cock I was in all this nonsense and that plus the anti-semitic stuff now it's filtered up it's filtered all the way up to the top of the editorial Ashkelon it's gotten so bad that even Jack hunter who's a paleo conservative a former Pat Buchanan Rand Paul guy right he's written how the alt-right supported by Breitbart quote turns you into a racist a-hole and he wrote that on Breitbart what Breitbart does they play this game the same game the Trump plays and it's a game they should spot it's an important game the game is this they run these editorials that are against the alt-right so they can say they gave both sides of hearing my Trump does this too from sort of panders to the alt-right he penhurst the anti-semites into the racists into the KKK and then he says okay well I'm but they're not my people I mean I don't have anything to do with them really but I just about it I don't want to be intolerant be a bigot and just shut down the debate they're more than happy Breitbart is to take their clicks from the alt-right because the alt-right knows what they're doing and trump is happy to take their support because the white supremacist know what Trump is doing and that's how you end up with renegade Jew running in giant letters across a site that panders to the alt-right people who like making Nazi memes right this is this is what they do and you know I'm sorry but David Horowitz throwing out the term renegade Jew to oppose Trump who who to describe people who oppose Trump on pro-israel and conservative grounds is bad Breitbart using that sort of language to drive the septic system a segment of its base is I think significantly worse I want to start with that today because I think that this is gonna become a larger and larger issue and it's it's really that this whole cycle is just heartbreaking for people like me who have spent 15 years you know half my lifetime in this movement people who made friends all across the the conservative spectrum to watch as people who I considered friends pander to some of the worst people on earth is really quite terrible okay so meanwhile speaking of Donald Trump Donald Trump there's an article in The New York Times today about Trump and and talking about Trump's history with women and we're having a discussion before the show with Andrew Klavan and and and Jeremy boring his managing editor it's a Lee Weyer we were talking about this New York Times article and it's it's an interesting article for a couple of reasons so first of all what they say is that Donald Trump has a history with women but then they don't talk about like the really bad stuff he's done they talk about basically how he was a womanizer and acted like kind of a sexist like for example he apparently they opened with this story of this woman who was a who I guess was in one of his I guess she was in one of his swimsuit routines and and so her name is Brewer Lane Rosie Brewer lane I think Roane Brewer Lane Roanoke a row man Borland and and apparently who's having a pool party at mar-a-lago and there are 50 models and 30 men so he apparently took one of them role ran brewer Lane in the back room and he took and he started showing her around the mansion he asked if she had a swimsuit she said no he took her into a room he opened drawers and then asked her to put on a swimsuit she was a 26 year old model she did this from a she said I went into the bathroom and tried one on it was a bikini I came out and he said Wow and then he decided to show her off he brought me out to the pool and said that is a stunning Trump girl isn't it miss Berlin said and then the New York Times says Donald Trump and women the words evoke a familiar cascade of casual insults hurled from the safe distance of a twitter account a radio show or a campaign podium okay a couple of things there are real things that Donald Trump says that are bad about women this one does not rise to the level of truly terrible first of all she consented to putting on the bikini and she didn't want him to treat her like a piece of meat she could have said no also she was hired to be a model at a pool party so I mean I assume that some of this goes along with the gig if you're hired to be a model at the Playboy Mansion and somebody says you're a Hugh Hefner girl you kind of go up and if you hire you're hard to go to a Trump party then you're Trump girls so then this is but the whole article is about stuff like this and I just I don't buy it now I will say that there is a tendency for people to go too far in all of this there's a tendency for people to say that stuff that actually is gross that he does is not actually gross because he's just being a man so for example the article Berry's like this one to me is much worse and Lindsey you telling Lindsey's are our official woman of the ben shapiro show so Lindsey you tell me if this one's worse Temple Taggart the 21 year old Miss Utah was startled by how forward he was with young contestants like her in 1997 as she recalls it he introduced himself in an unusually intimate manner he kissed me manner he kissed me directly on the lips I thought oh my god gross he was married to Marla maples at the time I think there were a few other girls that he kissed on the mouth I was like wow that's inappropriate so that one seems to me a lot worse that's an actual unwanted physical touching that seems to me a lot worse then come I'm gonna give you a tour of the mansion here's a bikini put it on she puts it on oh you look good in a bikini correct she's a model therefore that here she's a model but she's not there to be made out with by the guy who's running the thing right so that this is and apparently he then told her that she should go to modeling agencies in life better age she should say that she was 17 because that would make it easier for her to get modeling gigs and and so there's some stories about how he was not particularly nice with with women and you know there's stories here about a preoccupation with bodies this is one of the subheadings of preoccupation with bodies he possessed an almost compulsive need to talk about the bodies of women he worked with there was one woman he was working with and she apparently said to her at one point you like your candy because she was overweight and and apparently he he he only wanted to feature his most beautiful employees and all the pictures and this sort of stuff okay so this is not like wonderful stuff it's not the life all stuff but the idea that this is the worst stuff that ever happened there's an actual credible accusation that Donald Trump actually raped his first wife right I mean that was actually made in a court filing she later backed off of it but that's more credible and more damaging than any of this stuff but the media are so interested in getting Trump they're willing to try it I mean if this is what they've got this is weak t if this is the best they can do this is weak tea I mean they talk about how Donald Trump talks about sex all the time that has at his office and from Tower Trump seemed eager for his colleagues to hear about his new companion miss maples when the New York Post feasted on her supposed satisfaction with him in bed captured in the headline best sex I've ever had mr. Trump was unabashed he absolutely loved that he waved around the office did you see this everyone who worked there was kind of horrified we all thought it made him look bad he didn't why would that make him look bad she's a model and she was saying it's the best thing she ever had I'm not sure that they're I can't count on one hand the number of men who wouldn't be proud of that headlock that's just silliness so here's the thing they're so interested it is so stupid I mean they're saying for example that he calls women hon and deer really really like that that's that's really where it is that's that's where it is so they they bury the rape accusation two-thirds of the way down in the article okay so here's the thing all of this is gonna backfire because most people look at this men and women and they go am I supposed to be surprised like these men in Trump's image forever he was posting on the cover of Playboy years and years and years ago this guy who's on the Howard Stern Show all the time are we supposed to look at him calling women hon and deer and that he's done worse stuff than this in this in this campaign I mean he called a reporter he said she was bleeding out of her wherever and he tweeted out a picture of his opponents wife saying that she was ugly like am I supposed to be shocked by any of this but is what the media do and then it backfires on them so apparently that Roane ladies she apparently she was on first of all Trump women do not age well I'm just gonna say that this is for those who can't say it's a yeah I'll go full Trump here she's not aged particularly well but she's on America's election headquarters on Fox News she's that she's the after photo the Trump wives collection and and the and the the anchor on the left is the the Trump before photos of the Trump wives collection and here is row an the former Trump girlfriend who actually dated Trump talking about how the New York Times took her out of context what was your reaction when you read this article yesterday uh actually it was very upsetting why I was not happy to read it at all well because the New York Times told us several times that they would make sure that my story that I was telling came across they promised several times that they would do it accurately they told me several times and my manager several times that it would not be a hit piece and that my story would come across the way that I was telling it and honestly and it absolutely was not what did they get wrong well they did take quotes from what I said and they put a negative connotation I'd he spun it to where it appeared negative I did not have a negative experience with Donald Trump and I don't appreciate them making it look like that I was saying that it was a negative experience you knew him very well right you dated him for several months that's correct yes and he was never a never made me feel like I was being demean in any way he never offended me in any way he was very gracious I saw him around all types of people all types of women he was it was very kind thoughtful generous you know he was a gentleman okay so who's gentlemen everything was great and the media is out to get him okay so all the speeds into the perception that Trump is a victim he's a victim of the media and all of this backfires on on the media who are trying to get him and all of it ends up benefiting him in the end even stories that are they're clearly just ridiculous all of this ends up benefiting him because people look at this and they go really this is the best you've got on this guy so here's another example so apparently twenty years ago Donald Trump was asked about his sex life basically by the New York Post and the nura Post called him up or I'm sorry he was People magazine there was a reporter named sukar as well was in 1991 and she called the Trump office an interview with Donald Trump she'd been assigned to cover the soap opera surrounding the end of his marriage to Ivana his budding relationship with Marla maples and his rumoured affairs with a bunch of celebrities who appeared on the gossip pages so Carswell got a return call from from publicist okay so this is the audio of Trump's publicist you may notice that it sounds suspiciously like someone else who you may have heard a good deal about this is Donald Trump's publicist John Miller's from 1991 talking to sue Carswell of People magazine it goes on for 15 minutes like this yes that's Donald Trump okay that's the voice of Donald Trump CNN actually so Trump does what Trump does which is he just lies habitually they ask him about this on air and they say is that you and he goes no no it's not me he admitted openly in 1991 that was him right says so but now he's saying it wasn't him and so you got Katrina Pierson on TV saying it wasn't him it definitely wasn't him you know everybody just drops words like frankly and totally and the very best and tremendous right everybody just drops these words in normal conversation this is a thing that they do apparently according to the Trump camp so the media made a big deal out of this and it is it's a ridiculous stupid unbelievable story and it demonstrates just how egotistical and narcissistic he is as I tweeted over the weekend the reason that Hillary is not able to out to him and he's not able to out to her is because who takes the high ground in a battle between lying egotistical narcissistic pains in the ass like who exactly gets to take the moral high ground there the media went nuts over this over the weekend most people look at this and they laugh like it's like yeah it's crazy and yeah it's ridiculous but it's also just kind of crazy and ridiculous who cares who cares and and so what you're seeing here is the media's attempts to to get from I know Clavin talked about a little bit today media's attempts to get Trump are actually backfiring on the media now because they're so desperate to get him they don't know they're there like a like a small child babies have a reflex I'm now in baby mode because I've been Putin peed on about a thousand times between the last podcast in this one but the but babies have a reflex which is that if you and doctors test them on this if you if you hold them up by their hands and then drop them they go and they kind of they kind of spaz out well that's sort of what the media is doing with Trump there now lashing out in every possible direction to get this guy and that includes not going after the lowest hanging fruit like he's a corrupt charlatan like he's a liar like he's not a conservative like he's a bad guy instead of that they go to well you know and his bikini models were not happy with how he traded them and he masqueraded as his own PR man in nine ninety-one Bill Clinton's raping people in 1991 like who cares it's it's so silly and this is why Trump is benefiting Paul mana Ford who is Trump's Putin agents slash campaign director Paul Manafort says that says that Trump has as Hillary has a bigger problem with men than Trump does with women he says that's Jake Tapper well you know this is a this is one of these conventional wisdom facts that are not not correct yes there's this some high negatives on the part of that of Trump right now we've just come out of a very spirited contest Hillary Clinton's got high negatives too and when you look at the recent Quinnipiac polls that came out last week which showed Trump winning and in in Florida and and yes even or slightly ahead in Ohio and Pennsylvania you look at the gender gaps and the real gender gap is a male gender gap on the part of Clinton where she's got a bigger disparity between her her supports are in with men than Trump has with women so it's an issue it'll be dealt with we've covered coming through a healing process this is when we're unifying our party the national polls have all shown closure where Trump now is either you know 1 or 2 points behind or 1 or 2 points ahead so this is way early and still already we're seeing convergence on the part of the electorate with Donald Trump in the meetings at the hill with the leadership we're very positive okay so he's saying that we're all coming together everything is moving in the right direction Donald Trump is gonna become more conciliatory Hillary has a problem with men okay it is true by the way that Hillary has a problem with men and I point this out I wrote a little pamphlet about how to win the 2016 election and I actually sort of backed the Trump strategy of you have to win a few more white voters and you have to win more men because if it's gonna be tough for you to close that gender gap with women except on the safety issue hillary clinton alienates men this is true both personally and politically Hillary Clinton is not somebody who's going to draw a lot of men so all of this is true now none of this makes up for the fact that Donald Trump is in fact not a conservative so it's it's it's hard to watch this election unless you watch it as a comedy right I mean basically Walter Kerr is he was a columnist on theatre a Walter Kerr said is that comedy is the notion the difference of comedy and tragedy is that comma is the tragedy is man reaches for the star but he's bound by his mom his mortal being he's all in the end we all die right that's that's tragedy is that we do our best and we and we try to create but in the end we all end up in the ground comedy is the idea that we try to do our best we try to reach for the stars but we all fart right that's sort of the idea so this is the you can see the selection is comedy or you can see it as tragedy now I've been varying between the two I'm gonna try the rest of the way to see it Morris comedy because otherwise it's just too depressing you know we try to reach for the political stars and we end up with the political cancer of Trump and Clinton or we could just a political fart or it's a political fart I mean the only good news about comedy is that at some point the fart ends so that's that's one of the reasons why I would prefer for this election cycle to move quite quickly and it's hard not to it's hard not to laugh when when it's Donald Trump masquerading as his own PR guy now the the idea that that the party is coming around Trump it's one of the more disturbing things that I've seen because what I was always afraid of what I was always afraid of is that you remember the old the old Mary Poppins the spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down I was always afraid that a spoonful of Trump makes the absolute horrible crap that he believes go down among conservatives and so a lot of the terrible things that Donald Trump believes in and said those things will get pushed off to the side you'll see people that you respect start pretending the conservatism is okay with a lot of the things that Donald Trump does simply because they don't like Hillary and they just want they'd prefer to have Trump to Hillary you'll see them soft-pedaling how bad Trump is in order to help Hillary look I don't soft-pedal Hillary I think Hillary's a disaster area I think Hillary is is a moral demon I think that she's awful in every way it's possible to be awful I also think Trump is awful in pretty much every way it's possible to be awful and he has a significantly more authoritarian streak than Hillary does besides she's an authoritarian but she's not stupid enough to believe that she can actually get away with it he's dumb enough to believe that he can get away with it all of it which is to say changing the definition of conservatism to fit Donald Trump is is really a problem and it's one of the reasons I think there has to be a conservative movement outside of Trump you're about to see all these conservatives starting to swallow stuff they never would have swallowed just in order to help Trump and that's the part that's disturbing so I'm the left apart that's funny is that the media is trying to get him with all of this nonsensical stuff on the right the part that's disturbing is the right is trying to write off all of the the flaws Donald Trump because they're trying to make him win so Reince Priebus says number one that is the head of the RNC who's now number one Trump Lackey he is he says that the Paul Ryan will indeed the Speaker of the House will indeed endorse Donald Trump chairman Priebus how confident are you that speaker Ryan in the end will endorse Donald Trump and you know he keeps talking about a process how long does this process gonna take well listen I don't speak for Paul Ryan but what I can tell you is that I think both of these guys came into the meeting expecting a good meeting but I think they left and it was a great meeting I think they made a lot of progress and I would be you know I'd be surprised if we didn't get there you know not not not too much longer in the distant future so I think it was a good meeting and I take Paul at his word he wouldn't go do a press conference and say the things that he said just to say them he believes it and he's sincere but he wants to make sure it's real he doesn't want to just put on a show he wants to understand and make sure there's a real understanding of each other before he makes that endorse so he says that they're all gonna get together and that's going to involve writing off all of the foibles of Donald Trump so here's Priebus saying that all the stuff about Trump's personal life and there's a lot there that's a lot more disturbing than than him Oh Galang women in bikinis right I mean as I mentioned there's the rape allegation there's him flying to sex-slave island with Jeffrey Epstein there's there's him what he said about his daughters in the past he's you know he's kind of a goofy guy but Reince Priebus says we should ignore all of that nobody's gonna care about any of that what I would say is you know we've been we've been working on this primary for over a year Chris and I've got to tell you I think that all these stories that come out and they come out every couple weeks people just don't care I think people look at Donald Trump and say and Hillary Clinton and say who's going to bring an earthquake to Washington DC I think the bigger issue and when we make these judgments about people are you know whether or not individuals are throwing stones in glass houses and when people are hypocrites obviously that's when these stories have an impact but I don't think Donald Trump and his personal life is something that people are looking at and saying well I'm surprised that he's had girlfriends in the past I thought what people look at it Donald Trump Lauren so I think forgive me it's a traditional playbook and analysis really don't apply but but forgive me it's not whether or not he had girlfriends the question is whether or not he mistreated women whether he made unwanted advances whether he humiliated women in the workplace I don't understand why you say that people don't care about that and are you gonna look into the allegations well look I'm not saying people don't care about it I'm just saying I think the reason he's where he's at is that he represents something much different than the traditional analysis of individual candidates and yes everything bothers me Chris but I don't know the truth of these things I don't know they're reading everything bothers me but everything bothers me but how about I don't know the answer to that I'm sure that the Trump campaign will deal with that all right how about that but this whole I go we're gonna write it off because he's our boy I'm not real fond of that as a general rule we're seeing a lot of that happening right now one of the things that one of the myths that I think is really quite amazing that's that's that's out there is that the anti-trump people that the never Trump folks the reason we're doing this is for the money the reason we're doing this is because we've been paid off okay let's look at this for real okay the reason that the Trump people are doing this is because they have been paid off okay the reason that a lot of these from people are doing this is because they've been paid off let's take for example ben Carson so ben Carson is you recall was called a pedophile by Donald Trump on the campaign trail and ben Carson has openly stated that Donald Trump was going to give him a slot in his administration probably a Secretary of Health and Human Services if Donald Trump becomes president and yet here you have ben Carson lecturing people like me on a moral level why can't you back Trump it's immoral not to back Trump it just shows how corrupt you are not to back Trump here he is never Trump people have said from the beginning Donald Trump is not concerned he's not a traditional conservative there's probably some truth in that now they're telling Lisa that Mitt Romney and Mark Cuban might make good third-party candidates to run against Trump are they more conservative and Donald Trump is Mark Cuban more conservative than Donald Trump I'm getting confused well you know there's a level of arrogance there that is almost incomprehensible we have a system in place that allows the will of the people to be expressed now these people come along and say the people don't know what they're talking about kid get them out of here we're the ones who know who the nominee should be and I hope people are taking note of that and who these people are well Mark Cuban has said that he doesn't want to do it in fact it seems like the the never Trump people are having a hard time finding somebody who does want it and want to get your thoughts I mean is it is it too late in the first place and would it ensure that Hillary Clinton gets the White House well of course it would fracture the party and you know that's the goal of some of the people who would actually prefer to have Hillary in place because she's a known quantity she's wanted them I think a lot of the people have recognized that there's a political class it consists of both Democrats and Republicans and independents who believe that they are in control and they should maintain control okay so Donald Trump is part of that political class but I love ben Carson right a guy who was basically bribed to join the Trump administration now going out there the arrogance of these people even thinking that they can go out there and stump against Trump that's that's just it's almost incomprehensible almost as almost as arrogant as running for president on the basis of no political knowledge or experience and then continuing to run for weeks after my campaign ended but I didn't end I just wanted a nap in Florida in the middle of a campaign amazing I mean it so the speaking of people who have been paid off pat buchanan hasn't been paid off but pat buchanan is seeing for the first time his philosophy now ascendant in the Republican Party Pat Buchanan was discredited years and years and years ago as a kook as an anti-semite and Pat Buchanan is it's really a nasty figure but he's back he's back and he's back thanks to the Trump conds and here's Pat Buchanan saying that Paul Ryan is spoiling things they're spoiling things for everybody it's so terrible when Reagan did Grenada they all came home and the economy took off and they all went along with us let me tell you what Ryan is risking doing playing the Nelson Rockefeller spoiler roll showing up at the convention you've got a condemned extremism we can't have this in the party he wind up a dead dog along with George Romney's father Nixon went all out for a guy he disagreed with Goldwater in 1964 and wound up with two nominations for president and the new majority what a charming bunch those are twenty years ago that was a does a fresher look but but not not a not a great look for Pat Buchanan who's that eleanor clift I think maybe but in any case there's Pat Buchanan laughing it up because Paul Ryan and company they're there they have to just stop being Nelson Rockefeller first of all Trump is not Goldwater okay if you're gonna compare Nelson Rockefeller to Ryan you have to make Trump Goldwater Goldwater was a small government guy like a small government guy so small that he opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on the grounds that it forced private businesses to desegregate right that it forced private businesses not to engage in discrimination right that's how small government Goldwater was and Goldwater wasn't a racist right that's but this is the way to Pat Buchanan operates speaking of people again more people have been paid off Newt Gingrich is is clearly lobbying for the VP slot and saying so openly says you well you're either with us or you're with Hillary Clinton and I don't see any way that you you're either for Hillary Clinton oh you're for Donald Trump if you're not for Donald Trump you are functionally helping Hillary Clinton I think it's just that straightforward okay and if I if I don't vote for Hillary my functionally helping helping Donald Trump like how does this work exactly if you give me a choice between a Coke and a diet and a Pepsi and I say I would prefer the water he's that helping Coker's at helping Pepsi explain but there there's a real reason that Gingrich is doing this he says he wants to be Trump's VP obviously here here he is saying they said yes there's been a lot of speculation what I do for a living I know you didn't think I was above it there's a lot of speculation that he is going to ask you to be his running mate now if he asked you you're certainly gonna say yes well if you ask me I'm certainly going to say I want to sit down talk about it I don't think it's an automatic yes and you have to think through what what does he think the job involves and if he indicates as I'm sure he what you're gonna play a bigot he can cans Calista and me that it's doable and that it's serious and that we would in fact contribute I think we'd be very hard-pressed not to say yes of course you'd say yes that's the whole reason you're doing any of this you used to be a conservative and now you're following a nationalist populist down this line because you were discredited a couple of years ago you were somebody who is irrelevant a couple of years ago and now you're back in power and that's what's happening a lot of people you're noticing a coalition of the dispossessed and it's not the conservative dispossessed it's a bunch of people who feel like they were marginalized and now they're coming back the path you cannons and the Newt Gingrich's you're seeing a lot of people who are coming back who we're sort of from the political graveyard it's night of the walking dead in Republican land and a lot of these people are coming back because Trump is revitalizing them and now he's going to try it around the the inert body of Newt Gingrich in order to try and gin up conservative support so again all of this is is mildly troubling but it's but we can laugh at it because I mean this is just how corrupt politics always is and the part that's that's that's actually kind of funny about this is that the Trump campaign claims they're not corrupt they claim they're the most honest campaign ever and they're trotting out campaign surrogates to whom they've already made all sorts of promises the Chris Christie's and the Ben Carson's and I mean Trump said he's the king of debt he's also the king of payoffs so the idea that that it's people who oppose him who are being paid off is really quite ridiculous and absurd that they're doing it for the payoff it's it's it's amazing and meanwhile on the Democratic side of the aisle utter chaos is breaking loose so the only thing that can make Donald Trump a palatable candidate is the fact that Hillary Clinton is so wildly unpalatable so I'm looking at the latest polls and here's what the latest polls show Rasmussen which is always biased toward Republicans a little bit has Trump up too on Clinton that was 41 39 that was in late April and then there was the CNN RC poll that had Clinton up their team there's the PPP poll that's the the public policy there's a democratic poll they show Clinton up six and then there was a gravis poll over the weekend that shows Clinton up to 48 to 46 it's going to get closer before it starts to separate again the reason it's so close again is not because Trump is such an earth-shattering candidate although he does bring the heat as far as the media it's also because Hillary just she exudes yeah there's not a word for it just exudes it and so look at look at what happened over the Nevada convention at the Nevada Democratic convention the Democratic National Convention was breaking down because Nevada Democrats who did not back Hillary Clinton feel dispossessed and disenfranchised and they are ticked off here's what it looked like whoo in other tasks breaks loose trying to force us to leave the bad and back here and they have moved to the front over here and okay so we can cut it off so basically what happened here is that the DNC right instead Debbie wasserman-schultz she says she has nothing to do with this this is the state convention they're choosing they were choosing caucus members and Bernie Sanders supporters wanted 64 rejected Pro Sanders delegates this is according to Real Clear Politics listen in a minority report prepared by their campaign they wanted them to be able to participate in selecting delegates from the National Convention this lady as you saw right there declared a voice vote and then arbitrarily just declared what the result of the voice boat was which says eyes and nays getting or anything right that it's clear you can't there's no more than no mores than nays for sure she just declares it over smacks the gavel down like in the like Bill Clinton slapping a models ass and just takes the gavel in just whack and then in his walks Hubbell pissed she walks out like a wrecking ball and it's in there's there's chaos inside the Democratic National Convention inside the Democratic Party here's a Nevada convention leader and he's saying look you guys are disenfranchising us this is a Sanders supporter the credentials Minority Report was chased on the challenge of 64 Sanders delegates contrary to the procedures into the precedent set by the committee nearly none of these 64 people were presented with the opportunity to be heard by the committee or to demonstrate that they are registered Democrats we aim the undersigned ease as credentials I should say duly appointed credentials committee members submit a minority report that challenges the decision of the committee without an opportunity to be heard no delegates should be stricken it's all sorts of chaos over on the Democratic side of the aisle so what's making Trump competitive is the fact that Hillary is so terrible what's making Hillary competitive is the fact that Trump is so terrible and so we'll just laugh our way to the Armageddon to the apocalypse at both of these crazy characters and it is amusing Barbara Boxer the senator from California legitimately the dumbest woman in politics she was that this Nevada convention and and here she is whining about being booed in the Democratic Party civility because the whole future of the country is at stake okay been good enough of Barbara Boxer so gas is in the Democratic Party too so while the media is focused on the cast inside our party which is worth focusing on the Democratic Party has Dawn's head of chaos they'll last one more election cycle the last one more election cycle and then this sucker breaks out into the open this is gonna get very ugly for them in about four years so right now they're gonna hold it together because this is their last flailing grip but after this things are imagine if Trump had actually been stopped at the convention this would have just bubbled for another four years and then broken loose so in the way it's better that he takes the nomination so we can have this battle now better day better to get this out of the way I'm somebody who believes that you get the bad stuff out of the way so you can get to the good stuff the Democrats are holding it off for another four years but things will get very ugly on their side of the aisle okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like I'm in the middle of Robert Kaplan's book The Revenge of geography and it's very good it's basically it's his argument about how we have all these highfalutin ideas about foreign policy going in human rights saving people and we have to understand the constraints of geography that there are realities on the ground that are not just ideological but that are actual physical geographies on the ground making it difficult for us to control certain areas of the globe and our machinery may not be comprehensive enough to to do all of this without a long-term occupation as we found out in Afghanistan other things that I like Clarence Thomas Supreme Court justice the most conservative Supreme Court justice the best Supreme Court justice I think he was a better thinker than Justice Scalia Scalia's a better writer but here is Justice Thomas talking about political correctness at a graduation ceremony and and this is the sort of clarity that we lack in too much of our politics as you go through life try to be that person whose actions teach others how to be better people and better citizens reach out to that shy person who's not so popular stand up for others when they're being treated unfair early in small things and large take the time to listen to that friend who's having a difficult time do not hide your faith and your beliefs under a bushel basket especially in this world that seems to have gone mad with political correctness treat others the way you would like to be treated if you stood in their shoes okay we can stop it I mean this is basic stuff basic common-sense stuff but it's missing in both parties now I treat others decently no threats of violence no incentivizing riots no attempts to put the government gun to somebody's head because you disagree with them and these are their basic truths and this is what I fear being lost on both sides of the political aisle I always thought it was their side and what troubles me is what's happening on this side okay quick thing that I hate there's an MSNBC gas trying to explain why it is that we should all be totally cool with men in women's bathrooms her name is Lea rag or she's an assistant professor at Harvard Kennedy School Business and she's a here she is reacting to Obama's order that all public education facilities allow students to use the bathroom that matches the gender they identify what they don't have to change their sex they don't have to change it on their birth certificate they don't have to change their name nothing they just get to say here's how I identify they need up maybe a note from home or something and which will never be forged because kids never Forge notes from home it's never happened I've never done that and and and and here she is explaining why conservatives are gonna have a problem with this if this is a hot-button issue amongst conservatives right this is not necessarily an issue that needs to be that shouldn't be kind of alright I mean it shouldn't be a radical thing to find why and what conservatives really need to do right what they need really needs to figure out is how is this different right from the civil rights movement of say the 1960s right many of them much of the language that is being used is identical to language that is being used during the 1965 word okay just because you're using hijacking the language of the 1960s doesn't mean that the underlying facts are the same it turns out that sex and race are two very different things it turns out that race doesn't have a lot of connection so anybody's capacity doesn't have a connection to threat level doesn't have a connection to anything but what does have a connection to how people behave is your sex it turns out that these things are relevant which is why it was explicitly stated in title mine of the Civil Rights Act that all these people are now trying to pervert that there would be separate facilities for men and women and listen if you want to play this game especially women I don't know why women are on board with this this is this is for women to go along with the idea then now everybody should hold by the same common standard and you understand there will never be a women's basketball team again right there will never be a women's baseball team again all the restrooms will look like garbage because men will be peeing on the floor so I hope that you enjoy all of this and beyond all that it really is evil how the left targets children for these sorts of for these sorts of moves because what they do is they kids are easily confused kids need guidance and there's this idea on the left that people are inherently it's it's here's the amazing thing they assume that sexuality gender identity these things are unchanging and unimpacted by the environment in which people live but your sex is totally malleable so I can change from a man into a woman but in my head I never changed it all based on my environment so they figure ok if we go into a public school and we tell kids that they can be either a boy or a girl depending on what they want to do that's not gonna confuse kids who are eight that's not gonna confuse kids who are seven and five that's I'm confused kids at all as I'm gonna be taking on thority away from parents it's not gonna lead to human suffering because these kids were always gonna be transgender nonsense nonsense what they do is they target children by claiming they're protecting a couple of kids we have to protect these couple of kids who have a mental illness we have to protect them from other kids being cruel to them which is again such silly nonsense the fact is that nobody is in favor of cruelty and suggesting that a girl who is a girl will go to the bathroom in the girls room if a girl thinks she's a boy she's much more significant life issues really then significant mental issues and health issues then where she pees when she's at school but the idea is that you're using the victimized children these couple of victimized children or to victimize all the children by making them victims of the society the sexless Society that never exists except in the perverse heads of the people who push it it's a battle against reality by the left but they never stop battling reality well we'll be back with more Tales from the Crypt tomorrow and and I'm sure that there will be lots to talk about Donald Trump has apparently challenged the Prime Minister of Great Britain to an IQ test to an IQ off which is not how IQ tests work but he would know that if you had a high one but we'll talk about that tomorrow always lots to talk about here in Trump America I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
