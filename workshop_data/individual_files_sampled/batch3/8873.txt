A YEAR BRINGING MIGRANTS INTO THE U.S. Shannon: TRACE GALLAGHER, THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, TWO OF THOSE REBELS JOIN ME NOW. TROY EDGAR, MAYOR OF LOS ALAMITOS COUNTY AND MARGARET MEANS, THERE FRESNO COUNTY SHERIFF. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. MAYOR, WHAT WAS IT LIKE TODAY? I HEARD HELP WAS ON THE WAY. HE WAS REALLY ENCOURAGING. AN ACTION ORIENTED MEETING. HE HAD THEIR SHARE OF TALKING ABOUT THE LAW-ENFORCEMENT SIDE, HAD THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS FOCUSED ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE, CHECKS AND BALANCES THE NEED TO HAPPEN BETWEEN THE FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. Shannon: SHERIFF, I WANT TO REVIEW SOMETHING FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ACLU OF SAN DIEGO TALKING ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKING WITH THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. SHE SAID "NATIONWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS AND POLICE CHIEFS ACKNOWLEDGE PUBLIC TRUST IS KEY TO EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY POLICING. WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY TO REPORT CRIMES WHEN VICTIMS AND WITNESSES. THEY MAY BE DEPORTED IF THEY CONTACT LOCAL POLICE. IT'S AN ARGUMENT WE HEAR A LOT." WHAT'S THE REALITY OF THE IMPACT OF THE CENTURY STATE LAWS ON YOUR ABILITY TO DO YOUR JOB AS A THE IMPACT IS THAT THIS ENTRY STATE LAW PROTECTS CRIMINALS, NOT VICTIMS AND WITNESSES. THAT IS THE BIG PROBLEM. THE BIG MYTH THAT SOME OF THE VICTIMS AND WITNESSES ARE BEING TOLD. THAT MAKE THEM AFRAID. SO THE SANCTUARY STATE LAWS SAYS THAT WHEN SOMEBODY COMMITS A CRIME, GETS ARRESTED, AND GETS BOOKED INTO A COUNTY JAIL, I AM PROHIBITED FROM TALKING TO I.C.E. ABOUT SOME OF THOSE INMATES IN MY JAIL. NOTHING ABOUT VICTIMS AND WITNESSES. IN FACT, WE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO TRYING TO REASSURE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT IF YOU ARE A VICTIM OR A WITNESS TO A CRIME, I CAN ACTUALLY HELP YOU BE HERE LEGALLY BY RECOMMENDING A VISA THAT GIVES SOMEONE A THREE YEAR LEGAL RESIDENCY IF THEY REPORT THE CRIME AND ARE INVOLVED IN THE PROSECUTION. SO THAT IS COMPLETELY FAKE. IT'S A MYTH. UNFORTUNATELY IT'S CAUSING MORE FEAR IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE VICTIMIZED. Shannon: YOU HEARD IN THE REPORT, TRACE GALLAGHER TALKED ABOUT HOW GOVERNOR BROWN RESPONDED TO YOU BEING THERE. YOUR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM SAYS "CUTE MEETING, DONALD TRUMP. CHERRY PICKING A FEW RIGHT WING ELECTIVES." SINCE YOUR TEAM DIDN'T BRIEF YOU COME HERE ARE THE FACTS. SANCTUARY COUNTIES HAVE FEWER CRIMES, HIGHER MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOMES, LOWER POVERTY, AND LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT. MAYOR, IF THAT IS THE CASE, WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING BACK? I AM HOPING HE ISN'T REALLY TELEGRAPHING WHAT COULD COME IF HE WAS TO BE ELECTED AS GOVERNOR. WE ARE HOPING FOR A GOVERNOR WHO WORK WITH US. WE ARE BIPARTISAN ON CITY COUNCIL. WE HAVE TO WORK WITH BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. WE ARE REASONABLE, NOT LOWLIFE LIKE GOVERNOR BROWN CALLED US. BUT WE ARE HOPING TO DO IS LEAD BY EXAMPLE. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES INVITED THE PEOPLE BACK TO THEIR HOUSE. HE INVITED CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ONE OF THE SMALLER CITIES IN ORANGE COUNTY, THE SHERIFF, A BUNCH OF PEOPLE. HE WANTS TO HAVE A DIALOGUE. HE WANTS TO GET FEEDBACK. LIKE MELISSA MELENDEZ SAID, WE WOULD WELCOME A DISCUSSION WITH GOVERNOR BROWN. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL XAVIER BECERRA, I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE AN OPEN FORUM WITH HIM. HAVE THEM COME TO A LITTLE CITY WHERE HE CAN BEAT UP ON SOMEONE WHERE HE DOESN'T FEEL AS PREPARED AS A BIPARTISAN PERSON DEALING DIRECTLY AT THE RETAIL LEVEL IN POLITICS. WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. IT'S NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE WANT. THEY WANT LAW AND ORDER. Shannon: WE TOOK THE SHOW OUT THERE FOR A COUPLE DAYS IN LOS ANGELES. WE WERE ALL OVER THE STATE TALKING TO PEOPLE, SEEING WHAT WAS GOING ON. A NUMBER DON'T LIE. INDEPENDENT STUDIES SHOW HIGH POVERTY RATE, THROWING HOMELESSNESS, CRIME ISSUES, FISCAL ISSUES AS WELL. SHERIFF, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT WHAT'S BEING DECIDED IN SACRAMENTO BY THE TOP AND HOW IT TRICKLES DOWN IN YOUR COMMUNITY? WHAT I'M HEARING IN MY COMMUNITY IS GREAT SUPPORT FOR FIGHTING BACK ON THE SANCTUARY STATE ISSUES. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE OPEN DIALOGUE WITH OUR FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS. WE LEARNED THAT AFTER 9/11. WE LEARNED HOW IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION AND RELATIONSHIPS ARE. AND NOW HERE WE ARE YEARS LATER, AND PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT MESSAGE. AND IT'S VERY DISAPPOINTING TO ME. I'VE BEEN SHERIFF NOW FOR 12 YEARS. AND I REALLY FEEL LIKE I KNOW WHAT MY COMMUNITY WANTS, AND THEY WANT THE RULE OF LAW. WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT OUR HARDWORKING IMMIGRANTS OUT THERE NOT COMMITTING CRIMES. WE DO NOT ASK VICTIMS OR WITNESSES OF CRIMES THAT THEY ARE HERE ILLEGALLY OR NOT. MY CONCERN IS WHEN SOMEBODY GETS ARRESTED AND BOOKED INTO OUR JAILS, WE NEED TO HAVE FREE-FLOWING INFORMATION GOING BACK AND FORTH. WITH I.C.E. IN OUR JAIL POPULATION. Shannon: YOU MENTIONED THAT THE WHITE HOUSE YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT HAVING AN MS-13 GANG MEMBER AND NOT BEING ABLE TO TELL FEDERAL AGENCY HAD SOMEONE
