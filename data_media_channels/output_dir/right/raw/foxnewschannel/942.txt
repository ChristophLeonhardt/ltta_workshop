1
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:22,997
BERKELEY CITY COUNCIL DECLARED

2
00:00:22,997 --> 00:00:24,231
THE WORLD IN A QUOTE CLIMATE

3
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:24,932
EMERGENCY.

4
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:26,801
THEY CALLED FOR A PUSH TO HALT

5
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:27,935
ALL CARBON EMISSIONS WORLDWIDE

6
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:30,738
AND SAID GOVERNMENTS MUST MAKE

7
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:33,107
EFFORTS TO "HUMANELY STABILIZE

8
00:00:33,107 --> 00:00:33,941
POPULATION.

9
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:36,110
THAT'S A PHRASE WHICH

10
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,513
ROBESPIERRE WOULD SURELY LOVE.

11
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:41,115
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.

12
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:43,517
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME, TUCKER.

13
00:00:43,517 --> 00:00:45,219
>> Tucker: SO I'M A PRETTY

14
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:47,421
LITERAL PERSON, IF THEY SAY

15
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:48,422
CLIMATE EMERGENCY, THAT SOUNDS

16
00:00:48,422 --> 00:00:49,323
RIGHT TO ME.

17
00:00:49,323 --> 00:00:51,759
SO IF IT'S AN ACTUAL EMERGENCY,

18
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,128
WHY DOES ANYONE IN BERKELEY HAVE

19
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:55,329
AN AIR CONDITIONER?

20
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:56,363
I HATE TO SORT OF ACTS THAT

21
00:00:56,363 --> 00:00:57,765
PEOPLE LIVE OUT THEIR PURPORTED

22
00:00:57,765 --> 00:00:58,699
BELIEFS, BUT IF THEY ARE TELLING

23
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:00,101
THE REST OF US WE NEED TO HAVE

24
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,503
FEWER KIDS, WHY ARE THEY STILL

25
00:01:02,503 --> 00:01:05,105
DRIVING AND USING THE AC?

26
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:07,708
>> I TOTALLY BELIEVE YOU, TUCKER

27
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:08,375
BUT I DON'T THINK THEY ARE

28
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,711
TELLING US TO HAVE LESS BABIES.

29
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:12,213
CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE IMPACT

30
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:14,115
THAT HUMAN BEINGS HAVE ON

31
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,583
ENVIRONMENT IS RELATED TO A LOT

32
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:15,950
OF STUFF.

33
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,118
NOT JUST THE AMOUNT OF CHILDREN

34
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,321
THAT WE ARE HAVING BUT CARBON

35
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:21,722
EMISSIONS AND EATING LESS MEAT.

36
00:01:21,722 --> 00:01:23,090
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE

37
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,792
CARE ABOUT OUR PLANET BUT IT'S

38
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:29,563
NOT ABOUT HAVING LESS CHILDREN.

39
00:01:29,563 --> 00:01:30,231
>> Tucker: AND I DON'T THINK

40
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:32,133
IT IS.

41
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,334
>> ARE WE AGREEING?

42
00:01:33,334 --> 00:01:35,302
>> Tucker: NO, I SAID THE IDEA

43
00:01:35,302 --> 00:01:36,537
IS INSANE AND GROTESQUE AND IT'S

44
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:39,073
A WINDOW INTO WHAT THIS REALLY

45
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:45,379
IS, WHICH IS -- >> THEY AREN'T

46
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:48,482
SAYING IT'S AN EMERGENCY,

47
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:50,785
EVERYONE HAS STOMACH AND STOP

48
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:51,786
HAVING BABIES.

49
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:52,753
>> Tucker: BUT HOLD ON.

50
00:01:52,753 --> 00:01:56,157
IF THEY ARE SAYING AND IT'S AN

51
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,091
EMERGENCY, PRESUMABLY THEY

52
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:58,325
BELIEVE IT IS.

53
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:01,328
SO HOW CAN THEY JUSTIFY WRITING

54
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:03,364
BIASES, HAVING CARS,

55
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:04,398
REFRIGERATORS, ANY ACTIVITY THAT

56
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:07,168
ADDS TO THE SUM TOTAL OF CO2

57
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,002
EMISSIONS?

58
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:10,336
WHY ARE THEY STILL COMMITTING

59
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:10,937
THESE ACTIVITIES?

60
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:13,574
WHY SHOULD I LISTEN AND TAKE

61
00:02:13,574 --> 00:02:14,775
ANYONE SERIOUSLY WHO IS DRIVING

62
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:15,543
A CAR AND SIMULTANEOUSLY TELLING

63
00:02:15,543 --> 00:02:19,880
ME NOT TO HAVE MORE KIDS?

64
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,116
>> I DON'T THINK THEY ARE SAYING

65
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:22,716
THAT.

66
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:25,686
IT'S A COMBINATION OF FACTORS.

67
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:28,722
AND IT'S A COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT.

68
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:31,158
I THINK IN GENERAL, THE YOUNGER

69
00:02:31,158 --> 00:02:33,694
GENERATION, THE MILLENNIALS, ARE

70
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:34,762
BECOMING MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY

71
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:35,129
CAUTIOUS.

72
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:36,997
I THINK THE TECHNOLOGY IS

73
00:02:36,997 --> 00:02:39,567
CATCHING UP TO THE FACT THAT

74
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:40,801
PEOPLE ARE BECOMING MORE

75
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:41,168
CONSCIOUS?

76
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:43,571
>> Tucker: IF PEOPLE ARE MUCH

77
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:44,305
POORER BECAUSE THEY ARE DEEPLY

78
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:46,774
IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR DEGREES

79
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:47,775
THAT MEAN NOTHING BECAUSE THEY

80
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:49,877
HAVE BOUGHT INTO THE SYSTEM THAT

81
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:51,645
IS ESSENTIAL AND DOWN LIKE A

82
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:53,480
SOCIALLY FRAUDULENT, AND THEY

83
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,985
HAVE NO MONEY.

84
00:02:57,985 --> 00:02:58,886
THEY ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY

85
00:02:58,886 --> 00:02:59,887
CONSCIOUS, BUT THEY ARE POOR.

86
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:02,223
>> THAT'S ONE PART OF IT, BUT

87
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,290
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE FACTOR

88
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,124
WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE

89
00:03:04,124 --> 00:03:08,295
AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO REDUCE OUR

90
00:03:08,295 --> 00:03:08,929
IMPACT.

91
00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:10,798
>> Tucker: I AM ACTUALLY IN

92
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:12,566
FAVOR OF A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT.

93
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:14,935
SO I WONDER WHY, HAVE YOU

94
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:15,369
NOTICED THIS?

95
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:16,837
PLACES THAT SPEND OF THE MOST

96
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:18,172
ENERGY TELLING THE REST OF US

97
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:19,773
THAT THE WORLD IS ENDING BECAUSE

98
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:22,877
OF CLIMATE CHANGE ALSO TEND TO

99
00:03:22,877 --> 00:03:24,979
HAVE THE DIRTY STREETS AND THE

100
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:25,679
LARGEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE

101
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:27,514
RELIEVING THEMSELVES ON THE

102
00:03:27,514 --> 00:03:29,350
SIDEWALK, AND THE MOST TRASH?

103
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,151
IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE

104
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:32,152
ENVIRONMENT, MAYBE YOU SHOULD

105
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:35,322
CLEAN UP IN FRONT OF CITY HALL.

106
00:03:35,322 --> 00:03:36,190
DOES THAT OCCUR TO LIBERALS?

107
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,858
>> IT'S NOT JUST LIBERALS THAT

108
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:39,560
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CLIMATE

109
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,961
CHANGE, IT'S ALL OF US.

110
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:42,363
AND I AGREE WITH YOU, WE CAN'T

111
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:45,232
JUST TALK THE TALK, WE HAVE TO

112
00:03:45,232 --> 00:03:47,668
FOLLOW UP WITH ACTIONS.

113
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:50,271
YOU CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT

114
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,605
AND MAKING THE WORLD A

115
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:54,308
CLEANER -- AND CLEARLY I AM FOR

116
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:54,608
THAT.

117
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:57,611
>> WE AGREE WITH THAT, WE ALL

118
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:58,712
WANT TO KEEP THE ENVIRONMENT

119
00:03:58,712 --> 00:03:59,346
CLEANER.

120
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:03,017
>> Tucker: HAVE YOU BEEN TO

121
00:04:03,017 --> 00:04:03,784
BERKELEY?

122
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:04,218
NEW YORK CITY?

123
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:04,718
SAN FRANCISCO?

124
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:05,886
THERE ARE PEOPLE RELIEVING

125
00:04:05,886 --> 00:04:08,322
THEMSELVES ON THE SIDEWALK AND

126
00:04:08,322 --> 00:04:10,624
THEN WALKING AROUND THEM ARE

127
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,292
ENVIRONMENTALISTS WANTING TO

128
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,227
LECTURE ME ABOUT HOW MANY KIDS I

129
00:04:13,227 --> 00:04:13,527
HAVE.

130
00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:16,262
>> BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S NOT

131
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:18,966
NECESSARILY ABOUT WHERE IN THE

132
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:20,801
WORLD IS MORE POPULATED, IT'S

133
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,137
ABOUT WHO IS USING MORE

134
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:23,904
RESOURCES.

135
00:04:23,904 --> 00:04:25,639
AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE

136
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,941
HAVE TO DO MUCH BETTER.

137
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:27,775
>> Tucker: DO YOU AGREE THAT

138
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,976
IF WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THE

139
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:31,378
WORLD CLEANER, WE COULD START BY

140
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:32,780
CLEANING UP THE SIDEWALKS?

141
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,081
THEN WE COULD MAYBE GET TO THE

142
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:37,184
PART ABOUT FIXING THE HOLE IN

143
00:04:37,184 --> 00:04:37,685
THE OZONE LAYER.

144
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:40,020
>> I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE

145
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,255
EITHER OR, IT'S EVERY DAY.

146
00:04:41,255 --> 00:04:43,757
SPEAK ONE WAY OR THE CITIES WITH

147
00:04:43,757 --> 00:04:44,525
THE MOST OPEN AND AGGRESSIVE

148
00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:46,660
COMMITMENT TO THE ENVIRONMENT

149
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,028
THE DIRTIEST?

150
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:54,435
WHY IS PORTLAND, OREGON, A

151
00:04:54,568 --> 00:04:55,102
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

152
00:04:55,102 --> 00:04:56,337
I'M NOT TALKING SPECIFICALLY

153
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,204
ABOUT PORTLAND, BUT NOT ALL

154
00:04:57,204 --> 00:04:58,739
CITIES THAT ARE SAYING THAT WE

155
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:00,307
NEED TO DO BETTER ABOUT OUR

156
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:02,643
ENVIRONMENT ARE FILTHY.

157
00:05:02,643 --> 00:05:06,347
WE ARE YOU GETTING THAT FROM?

158
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,514
>> Tucker: OKAY.

159
00:05:07,514 --> 00:05:09,016
TRACK WITH ME REALLY QUICK JUST

160
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:11,919
FOR THIS ONE QUESTION.

161
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,121
IF YOU SAY YOU CARE ABOUT THE

162
00:05:14,121 --> 00:05:15,322
ENVIRONMENT, DO YOU AGREE OR

163
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:16,724
DISAGREE THAT MAYBE YOU SHOULD

164
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:17,558
START BY CLEANING UP THE STREET

165
00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:20,027
IN FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE?

166
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:23,330
>> WHY CAN'T YOU DO BOTH?

167
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:23,664
DO BOTH.

168
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:25,099
>> Tucker: I'M NOT SAYING THAT

169
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:25,632
YOU CAN'T DO BOTH.

170
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:28,602
BUT WHY IS IT THAT THE PEOPLE

171
00:05:28,602 --> 00:05:30,137
LECTURING ME ABOUT AND THE

172
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:32,740
ENVIRONMENT LIVE IN ENVIRONMENTS

173
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,340
THAT ARE FILTHY?

174
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,642
>> WE ALL CARE ABOUT THE PLANET

175
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:36,744
AND CAN DO MORE.

176
00:05:36,744 --> 00:05:38,312
>> Tucker: WE DON'T ALL CARE

177
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:39,179
ABOUT THE PLANET.

178
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:40,381
MY HOUSE HAS NOBODY SLEEPING ON

179
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,850
THE FRONT STEP BECAUSE I CARE

180
00:05:42,850 --> 00:00:00,000
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT.
