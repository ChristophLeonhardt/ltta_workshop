and the other guy that guy is called Habib nurmagomedov he's from Dagestan in Russia who would you maybe want to see win I don't know I don't care at all but as I know Conor McGregor I guess I afraid I'm a Gregor window yeah despite this guy's got a nice huh yeah it's called Parker by the way what Papa Papa huh no idea I'm gonna try it you wanna try and say it Papa Papa it's not too bad let's not see well let's see well consider any Spanish yeah papa yeah do you know these two guys no not so yeah that's me that's me yeah you with bird yeah yeah I've shaved you shaved so he shaved very well yeah very much the rest was not unique boy native my name is Azam valium know much about him yeah Rodya which moominpappa D is my Irish poets in Herefordshire booting ballads a Habiba the FG you know he's happy it's like yours huh do you know what is cool no it's called a Papa Papa yeah to have a go at trying to pronounce it okay Papa Papa Papa pretty good to be fair thank you very much that's a yeah I don't know the ripen so I guess the right that's logic for you there you go so we've actually managed to find Habib's first training partner so who do you thinks gonna win on Saturday yeah thanks very much yeah me too yeah so as you can see there's still some questions to be answered will it be a stand-up fight that's more suited to Conor McGregor or down on the ground more see into habib here in the very center of moscow they don't know whether it's gonna be a knockout or a points win it's still a split decision the scary thing about that fight is every round starts on its feet and that's scary for a kabhi floyd mayweather says there's great fighters and then there's god-gifted fighters and I believe that Connor and Abby are both god-gifted fighters they're very special men and and when you're dealing with a god gifted fighter it's hard to bet against them so what I want to do is is just watch as a fan because I really I really cannot choose look if I had to bet my house on the fight I wouldn't be able to make the bet it's fire but who knows what's gonna happen that's what makes it such a special fight I think the fights gonna be tremendous I think it could go two very different ways either McGregor keeping it on the feet and score on a knockout or could be getting it to the ground round at the round and and when in the victory and a five round decision it'll either be knockout on early rounds or a decision I'm a fan of both of them even though could be absorbing a steam I'm still a fan and and I'm just excited to see how level of expression was I'm not rooting for anybody I think for Habib the loss would be more devastating I think there's a lot riding on this fight for him his country you know it's country you know the weight of his country is on his back and things like that i think i think it really damage go Biebs brand and kind of or I think McGregor could lose the fight and still be just as loved and just as huge of a of a idol he's just he has that effect that people want to watch him no matter he could be doing Dancing with the Stars and I guarantee you the ratings will go up he's just he just has it so like I said McGregor can lose this and come back and a rematch and be just as big or go do some wild you know 185 pound fight and be just as big worker be I think just everything's riding on this for him they would it would definitely affect a beep star power losing this fight for Conor to win he has to not could be about that's true but Kabhi doesn't have to knock or rather could be doesn't have to take Conor down could be cannot Conor out quite easily he could and definitely on the ground I believe he'll be able to control and dominate him and do some damage you know the same narrative was out there before steep a and Daniel Cormier fought that Cormier had to take him down and steep a head and lock him out that's close except that the the grappler can always knock the other guy out right the one guy cannot both guys can always knock the other one out in this case Conor cannot takedown could be even won't even try and canter Conor cannot submit khabib and won't even try well I would look at it from the other perspective it would be a very positive for whichever one wins you know they truly are fighting over who the who the best featherweight in the world is or lightweight rather you know there's nobody that disagrees there's no guys in the locker room in the back talent Dana White that should be my spot everybody stood back and they go no you are the two right guys go figure it out so whoever wins it's going to be a tremendous boost I don't know that the loser will then it'll rescind it too much of his you know credibility but it'll be a good night for one of them the fact of the matter is as much as there is so much for for each one to wit to gain there's also a lot for each one to lose if McGregor loses in my opinion he will retire if Habib loses this fight not only does he lose his undefeated record but these losses to someone like McGregor when the temperature has been raised when the emotion is worldwide emotion these losses are painful they change a fighter forever look what happened to Jose Aldo a loss for Habib isn't just his first loss it's a loss to an archenemy it's a loss to somebody that every one of his fans wants him to destroy it's a loss to someone he thinks as a clown it's a loss to someone he thinks doesn't belong there with them do you follow what I'm saying when you face Conor McGregor the stakes are much much higher this the mental warfare game when you face Conor McGregor is fascinating and it is a huge part of every fight everybody who fights Conor McGregor thinks oh I won't let him under my skin everybody he penetrates into the mind of every fighter that he faces what he does is he elevates the temperature he raises the stress and the pressure and the consequences and the meaning of the fight and he does it very successfully and it affects everybody will it affect Habib I believe it will but will it affect him enough this is the question when you see Habib and he is already talking about you know he looks somewhat emotional he's already talking about when I see Conor McGregor we will fight that is somebody who's already on your mind he's already on Habib's mind you know I hear this question everywhere as if there are only two possibilities Conor will knock out Habib with his left hand or Habib will take down Conor and grind him out for a few rounds before I finishes him but that's insanity somehow we create this narrative that only these two things are possible how about this Habib absolutely positively can knock out Conor McGregor a hundred percent it is 100 percent possible we talked about his ground game and we talked about McGregor striking game but it's only a few years back he knocked out Thiago Tavares dropped him with one punch and Thiago was backing up Conor McGregor could MIT's Habib nurmagomedov it's the same concept as Habib knocking out MacGregor we find these narratives these simplified narratives that we have to discuss if Connor can defend the takedown or if your beebe can close the distance and as if that's all that has to happen so it just days to go before the biggest fight in MMA between Habib nurmagomedov and Conor McGregor we're here in the center of Moscow to see what the public know about the fight and who the back in let's go so do you know these two guys of course aha corner and beep Habib yes so you think this guy Habib will win yeah if he can take corner on the floor yes he will win okay so do you know this - you guys just corner just gonna yeah what about the guy on the right I need to guess frankly speaking don't doesn't remember them could you pick a winner from each one corner yeah why I saw his fight so I know it's a technique and skill so I I mean if I if I need to bet I bet on him uh-huh yeah and do you bet I know good better not see I'm sure thanks very much I'll reason idea tick do plates off the music that's Tony so Habiba corners chicken vegetable every night order aha are we like of a butch ability opportunity one man I said no people spa corner

gonna be supporting and who's gonna win I'm not supporting I can't choose because these the the the better wrestler and needs to better stand the boxer so so if he goes to the floor then had been and then he will win here maybe if it's gonna be a knockout kickboxing style it would be Conor McGregor yeah and that you know the name by the way of this half no no no no it's called Papa Papa one more time Papa ha that's pretty good that's pretty good yeah and who does it look better on me or happy go a few McGregor from Daniel October BD Jessica happy promenade of pyrovillia TiVo zone by Roberto

don't care at all but as I know Conor McGregor I guess I prefer how am I gonna go window yeah despite this guy's got a nice hat yeah it's called Parker by the way what Papa Papa Papa huh no idea I'm gonna try it you wanna try and say it Papa Papa Papa it's not too bad it's not too bad let's see what our consider any Spanish yeah Papa yeah so do you know these two guys no no so yeah that's me

managed to find Habib's first training partner so who do you thinks gonna win on Saturday yeah thanks very much yeah me too yeah so as you can see there's still some questions to be answered will it be a stand-up fight that's more suited to Conor McGregor or down on the ground more see to Habib here in the very center of Moscow they don't know whether it's gonna be a knockout for a points win it's still a split decision the scary sort of that fighters every round starts on its feet and that's scary for Kobe women weather says there's great fighters and then there's god-gifted fighters and I believe that Connor and Abby are both God gives it fighters they're very special men and and when you're dealing with a god gifted fighter it's hard to bet against them so what I want to do is is just watch as a fan because I really I really cannot choose like if I had to bet my house on the fight I wouldn't be able to make the bet it's fire but who knows what's gonna happen that's what makes it such a special fun I think the fights gonna be tremendous I think it could go two very different ways either McGregor keeping it on the feet and scoring a knockout or could be getting it to the ground round at the round and and went into victory and a five round decision ility to be knockout on early rounds or a decision I'm a fan of both of them even though could be beyond Daniel Cormier steam I'm still a fan and and I'm just excited to see high-level mixed martial arts I'm not rooting for anybody I think for a beep the loss would be more devastating I think there's a lot riding on this fight for him his country you know it's country you know the weight of his country is on his back and things like that I think i think it really damaged Habib's brand and his kind of aura I think McGregor could lose the fight and still be just as loved and just as huge of a of a idol he's just he has that effect that people want to watch him no matter he could be doing Dancing with the Stars and I guarantee you the ratings will go up he's just he just has it so like I said McGregor can't lose this and come back and a rematch and be just as big or go do some wild you know 185 pound fight and be just as big worker be I think just everything's riding on this for him they would it would definitely affect a beep star power losing this place for Conor to win he has to not could be bound that's true but Kabhi doesn't have to knock or rather could be doesn't have to take a corner down could be it cannot Conor out quite easily he could and definitely on the ground I believe he'll be able to control and dominated Medusa damage you know the same narrative was out there before steep a and Daniel Cormier fought that Cormier had to take him down and steep a had to lock him out that's close except that the the grappler can always knock the other guy right the one guy cannot both guys can always knock the other one out in this case Conor cannot take down could be Eve and won't even try and Konnor cannot submit to be and won't even fries well I would look at it from the other perspective it would be a very positive for whichever one wins you know they truly are fighting over who the who the best featherweight in the world is or light weight rather you know there's nobody that disagrees there's no guys in the locker room in the back time doing the white that should be my spot everybody stood back and they go no you are the two right guys feel figure it out so whoever wins it's gonna be a tremendous boost I don't know that the loser will then it'll rescind the too much of his you know credibility but it'll be a good night for one of them the fact of the matter is as much as there is so much for for each one to wit to gain there's also a lot for each one to lose if

there you go so we've actually managed to find Habib's first training partner so who do you thinks gonna win on Saturday yeah thanks very much yeah me too yeah so as you can see there's still some questions to be answered will it be a stand-up fight that's more suited to Conor McGregor or down on the ground more suited to Habib and the very center of Moscow they don't know whether it's gonna be a knockout or just cunning what about the guy on the right yes frankly speaking the scary thing about that flight is every round starts on its feet and that's gonna be tighter and I believe that Connor and Abby are both a very special men and and when we were dealing with a gifted fighter it's hard to bet against them so what I wanna do is just watch as a band because I really I really cannot choose look if I had to bet my house on the fight I wanna be able to make your bet it's fire this knows what's gonna happen that's what makes it such a special place I think that's gonna be tremendous I think you could go two very different ways I either McGregor keeping it on the feet and scored a knockout or could be getting it to the ground round at the round and when in the victory and the five round decision it would be not out an early round or decision I'm a fan of both of them even though could be beyond Daniel Cormier steam I'm still a fan and and I'm just excited to see high level of expression ones I'm not rooting for anybody I think for a Biebs the loss would be more devastating I think there's a lot riding on this fight for his country you know this country you know the weight of his country is on his back and things like that i think i think it really damaged the Biebs brand and it's kind of more I think McGregor could really play and still be just as loved and just as huge of a of a I don't know he's just he hasn't affected people want to watch him no matter he could be doing Dancing with the Stars and I guarantee you the ratings will go up he's just he just has it so like I said McGregor can lose this and come back and a rematch and be just as big or go do some wild you know 185 pound fight and be just as big worker be I think just everything's riding on this for him you know hey they would it would definitely affect a beep star power losing this fight for Conor to win he has to not could be about that's true but Kobe doesn't have to knock or rather could be doesn't have to take Connor down compete cannot Connor out quite easily he could and definitely on the ground I believe he'll be able to control and dominate him and do some damage you know the

other guy out right the one guy cannot both guys can always knock the other one out in this case Conor cannot take down could be banned won't even try and canter Conor cannot submit could be and won't even tries well I would look at it from the other perspective it would be a very positive for whichever one you know they truly are fighting over who who the best featherweight in the world is or lightweight rather you know there's no big disagree so there's no guys in the locker room in the back down Dana White that should be my spot everybody stood back and they go no you were the two light

insanity somehow we create this narrative that only these two things are possible how about this Habib absolutely positively can knock out Conor McGregor a hundred percent it is 100% possible we talked about his ground game and we talked about McGregor striking game but it's only a few years back he knocked out Thiago Tavares dropped him with one punch and Thiago was backing up Conor McGregor could submit Habib nurmagomedov it's the same concept as Habib knocking out McGregor we find these narratives these simplified narratives that we have to discuss if Connor can defend the takedown or if Habib can close the distance and as if that's all that has to happen so it just days to go before the biggest bite in MMA between heavy Namanga medal I'm Conor McGregor we're here in the center of Moscow to see a biblical notion about a fight and who the backing let's go so do you know these two guys of course aha corner and happy yes so you think happy will win yeah if he can take corner on the floor yes he will win okay so do you know these two guys just gonna what about the guy on the right I need to guess frankly speaking done doesn't remember his name could you pick a winner from each one corner yeah I saw his fight so I know it's a technique and skill so I I'm if I find it together I bet on him huh yeah and do you bet I know good better not see I'm sure thanks very much ah with 90 etic dew points off music that's doing it so habiba corners chicken possible every night order ha ha are we like about booty belly opportunity only night right no peoples Pokorny yeah ok so you know who these two guys are of course this is mr. new Megumi oh yeah that's pretty McGregor uh-huh yeah and they're gonna fight this weekend yeah I know who are you gonna be supporting and who's gonna win I'm not supporting I can't choose because he's the better wrestler and needs to better stand up boxer so so if he goes to the floor then again and then he will win here and maybe if it's gonna be a knockout kickboxing style it would be Conor McGregor yeah and that you know the name by the way this has no no no idea no no it's called Papa Papa one more time Papa that's pretty good that's pretty good yeah and who does it look bad around me or happy well yeah you can go a fugitive or was on vibrate so happy no easy corny does Conor McGregor must be at a group of a person owns a cabal POV buoy bell yet bonus to the corner where the boy is a condor you know nice you guys uf play is close enough and yet these guys to UFC fight is this once the champion this guy's from Russia and this guy's you know this guy no no this guy's Conor McGregor okay and if these guys had a fight who would you think would win because it was tattooed so who this guy yeah who's the best looking looking this guy really okay nice oh yeah well thank you very much disposed yet I'm that guy see I'm better looking a Conor McGregor Eagle I have that kind of he's 98 apparent like of all the booty Bali we service a meal cooler it's really you this one is he called oh my girl uh-huh and the other guy that guy is called Habib nurmagomedov he's from Dagestan in Russia are you serious I don't know he's got mine who would you maybe want to see win I don't know I don't care at all but as I know Conor McGregor I guess I prefer how am I gonna go window yeah yeah despite this guy's got a nice hat yeah let's go pop Parker by the way what Papa Papa Papa no idea I'm gonna try it you want to try and say it Papa Papa Papa oh that's too bad let's not consider any Spanish yeah Papa yeah so do you know these two guys no no it's all yeah that's me that's me yeah you with bird yeah yeah I've shaved you shaved so you shaved very well yeah very much the rest yeah okay haha with native week boy- top ability this variant premier normal cognitive mega medic I mean by names in Europe as a valium now my touch abelian yeah the road yet which move to be crushed by its Herefords sure she boot embodies a habibu the F do you know is hot like yours huh do you know what it's called no it's called the papasa yeah I do have a go at China pronounce it okay Papa Papa Papa pretty good thank you very much that's a yeah I don't know the right one so I guess the right that's logic for you there you go so we've actually managed to find Habib's first training partner so who do you thinks gonna win on Saturday yeah thanks very much yeah me too yeah so as you can see there's still some questions to be answered will it be a stand-up fight that's more suited to Conor McGregor or down on the ground more see to her beep here in the very center of Moscow they don't know whether it's gonna be a knockout for a points win it's still a split decision scary thing about that fighters every round starts on its feet and that's scary for people when the weather says there's great fighters and then there's god-gifted fighters and I believe that Conor and B are both god-gifted fighters they're very special men and and when you're dealing with a god gifted fighter it's hard to bet against them so what I want to do is is just watch as a fan cuz I really I really cannot choose look if I had to bet my house on the fight I wouldn't be able to make the bet it's fire but who knows what's gonna happen that's what makes it such a special fight I think the fights gonna be tremendous I think it could go two very different ways either McGregor keeping it on the feet and scoring a knockout or it could be getting it to the ground round after round and and when in the victory and a five round decision early to be knockout on early rounds or a decision I'm a fan of both of them even though Kabir's on Daniel Cormier steam I'm still a fan and and I'm just excited to see high level of expression once I'm not rooting for anybody I think for a bead the loss would be more devastating to so we're just days to go before the biggest fight in MMA between Habib nurmagomedov and Conor McGregor we're here in the center of Moscow to see what the public know about the fight so you think small these guys got a nice huh I'm gonna try an eternity easy yeah you really money this one and I'm bring my khaki yokas oh boy yeah yeah and they're gonna fight this weekend no are you gonna be supporting and who's gonna win I'm not supporting I can't choose because these the the the better wrestler and Easter better stand up boxer so so if he goes to the floor then have been and then he will win here and maybe if it's gonna be a knockout kickboxing style it would be Conor McGregor yeah and that you know the name by the way of this half no it's called Papa Papa one more time Papa ha that's pretty good that's pretty good yeah and who does it look better on me or happy October BD yes Ramon gamut of pure video TiVo zone by Roberto had no a second Anita's Conor McGregor must be that a group of a person owns a coffee bootable yet bonus to the corner what a boy as a Conrad you guys UF players close enough and yet these guys to UFC fighters this one's the champion this guy's from Russia and this guy's you know this guy this guy's Conor McGregor okay and if these guys had a fight who would you think would win I think this guy yeah because it was tattoo so who this guy Colin yeah who's the best looking best-looking this guy really okay nice oh yeah well thank you very much I suppose yet I'm that guy see I'm better looking a Conor McGregor eagle I have that Conor I'm he's no idea Tea Party Zach of all the booty ballet yet boy we said we Sammy Akula is Macaulay you have these born a knockout or getting it to the ground round at the ground and when in the victory in a fighh brown decision it'll either be knockout on early rounds or decision I'm a fan of both of them even though it could be Jean Daniel Cormier steam I'm still a fan and and I'm just excited to see how level of expression was I'm not rooting for anybody I think for Habib the loss would be more devastating I think there's a lot riding on this fight for him his country you know it's country you know the weight of his country is on his back and things like that i think i think it really damaged Habib's brand and his kind of aura I think McGregor could lose the fight and still be just as loved and just as huge of a of a idle he's just he has that it factor people want to watch him no matter he could be doing Dancing with the Stars and I guarantee you the ratings will go up he's just he just has it so like I said McGregor can lose this and come back and a rematch and be just as big or go call do some wild you know 185 pound fight and be just as big were could be I think just everything's riding on this for him they would it would definitely affect a beep star power losing this fight for Conor to win he has to not could be about that's true but kabhi doesn't have to knock or rather could be doesn't have to take Connor down could be cannot Conor out quite easily he could and definitely on the ground I believe he'll be able to control and dominate him and do some damage you know the same narrative was out there before steep a and Daniel Cormier fought that Cormier had to take him down and steep a heaven lock him out that's close except that the the grappler can always knock the other guy out right the one guy cannot but both guys can always knock the other one out in this case Conor cannot take down to be banned won't even try and canter Conor cannot submit to be and won't even tries well I would look at it from the other perspective it would be very positive for whichever one wins you know they truly are fighting over who they do the best featherweight in the world is all right with me rather you know there's no big disagree there's no guys in the locker everybody stood back and they go no you are the two right guys go figure it out so whoever wins it's gonna be a tremendous boost I don't know the loser will then it'll rescind it to my gym his you know credibility but it'll be a good night for one of them the fact of the matter is as much as there is so much far for each one to win it to gain there's also a lot for each one to lose if McGregor loses in my opinion you will retire if Habib loses this fight not only does he lose his undefeated record but these losses - someone like McGregor when the temperature has been raised when the emotion is worldwide emotion these losses a painting they change a fighter forever look what happened to Joe say Aldo the loss from the beam isn't just his first loss it's a loss to an archenemy it's a loss to somebody that every one of his fans wants him to destroy it's a loss to someone he thinks as a clown it's a loss to someone he thinks doesn't belong they're wrong if you follow what I'm saying when you face Conor McGregor the stakes are much much higher this the mental warfare game when you face Conor McGregor is fascinating and it is it a huge part of every fight everybody who fights Conor McGregor thinks oh I won't let him under my skin everybody he penetrates into the mind of every fighter that he faces what he does is he elevates the temperature he raises this the stress and the pressure and the consequences and the meaning of the fight and he does it very successfully and it affects everybody will it affect Habib I believe it will but will it affect him enough is the question when you see Habib and he is already talking about you know he looks somewhat emotional he's already talking about when I see Conor McGregor we will fight that is somebody who's already on your mind he's already on beam's mind you know I give this question everywhere as if there are only two possibilities Conor will knock out the beat with his left hand or Habib will take down Conor and grind him out for a few rounds before it finishes but that's insanity somehow we create this narrative that only these two things are possible how about this Habib absolutely positively can knock out Conor McGregor a hundred percent it is 100% possible we talked about his ground game and we talked about McGregor striking game but it's only a few years back he knocked out Thiago Tavares dropped him with one punch and see hago was backing up Conor McGregor could submit of even amalgamate oh it's the same concept as to be knocking out McGregor we find these narratives these simplified narratives that we have to discuss if Connor can defend the takedown or if your beebe can close the distance and as if that's all that has to happen okay who that's the pipe this mental warfare you face Conor McGregor is fascinating and it is it a huge part of everybody everybody who fights Conor McGregor thinks oh I won't let him under my skin everybody he penetrates into the mind of every fighter that he faces what he does is he elevates the temperature he raises this the stress and the pressure and the consequences and the meaning of the fight and he does it very successfully and it affects everybody will it affect Habib I believe it will will it affect him enough is the question when you see Habib and he is already talking about you know you look somewhat emotional he's already talking about when I see Conor McGregor we will fight that is somebody who's already on your mind he's already on Bebe's mind you know I hear this question everywhere as if there are only two possibilities Conor will knock out a bead with his left hand or Habib will take down Conor and grind him out for a few rounds before it finishes but that's insanity somehow we create this narrative that only these two things are possible how about this Habib absolutely positively can knock out caught him is right a hundred percent it is 100 percent possible we talked about his ground game and we talked about move Reger striking game but it's only a few years back he knocked out Thiago Tavares dropped him with one punch and Thiago was backing up Conor McGregor could submit khabib nurmagomedov it's the same concept as khabib knocking out McGregor we find these narratives these Mulla five narratives that we have to discuss if Connor can defend the takedown or if Habib can close the distance and as if that's all that has to happen so it's just days to go before the biggest fight in MMA between heavy Namanga meadow and Conor McGregor we're here in the Senator Moscow to see what the public know about the fight and who the backing let's go so do you know these two guys of course beep ha beep yes so you think this guy Habib will win yeah if he can take corner on the floor yes he will win okay so do you know these two guys just kind of what about the guy on right I need to guess frankly speaking doesn't remember could you pick a winner from each one Connor yeah I saw his fight so I know it's a technique and skill so I if I find it too late I bet on him and do you bet I know good better not see I'm sure thanks very much I'll reason idea pick two points off with the music that's looming Conan's chicken pie Seba ha ha are we exact about Bucci Billy opportunity oh okay so you know who these two guys are of course this is mr. new Mohammed oh yeah that's pretty MacGregor uh-huh yeah and they're gonna fight this weekend yeah I know who are you gonna be support in and who's gonna win I'm not supporting I can't choose because he's the better wrestler and it's the better stand a boxer so so if he goes to the floor then again and then he will win here and maybe if it's gonna be a knockout kick boxing style it would be Conor McGregor yeah and that you know the name by the way of this huh no that there's no idea no no it's called pop aha one more time papa that's pretty good that's pretty good yeah and who does it look bad around me or go a fugitive a widow had no elisa korenne leaders must be that a group of a person is a cup of the beauty balance bones is a corner where the boy is a corner you guys UF players close enough and yet these guys to UFC fighters this one for champion this guy's from Russia and this guy's you know this guy so this guy's kind of McGregor okay and if these guys had a fight who would you think would win yeah because it was tattoo so who this guy caught on yes he's the best looking okay nice oh yeah well thank you very much let's pose yet I'm a guy see I'm better looking a Conor McGregor legal that he's no idea - pardon exact evolving booty buddy boy we said we saw his market rally even a question that guy's called Habib nurmagomedov he's from Dagestan in Russia would you maybe want to see with I don't know I don't care talk but I know my record I guess this guy's got a nice hat no idea you want to try it you wanna try and say it pursue violence in Spanish do you know these two guys not oh yeah that's me aha I was not a quality video as a valiant nobody Russian poets sure she aboot invalids afternoon yeah Gino is hot Papa Papa frita he could thank you very much that's logic for you there you go so if I see managed to find Habib's first training partner and so he thinks gonna win on Saturday yeah thanks very much yeah me too yeah so as you can see there's still some questions to be answered will it be a stand up fight that's more suited to Conor McGregor fought down on the ground more suited to Kirby yeah in the very center of Moscow they don't know whether it's gonna be a knockout or a points win it's still a split decision everything about that fight is every round starts on its feet and that's scary for it could be wondering whether says there's great fighters and then there's John get this fighter and I believe that Connie and these are both God gifted fighters a very special man and and when we're dealing with a god but jet fighter hard the bet against me so what I want to do is is just watch as a fan because I really I really cannot choose what if I had to bet my house on the fight I wouldn't be able to make the bet it's quiet this who knows what's gonna happen that's what makes it a question for it I think the fights gonna be tremendous I think if you go to very different ways I either McGregor keeping it on the seat and score on a knockout or could be getting into the ground round back the round and and went into victory and a five round decision Italy would be knock out an early round or a decision I'm a fan of both of them even though Kabir's on Daniel Cormier steam I'm still a fan and and I'm just excited to see how Little Mix specialize I'm not rooting for anybody I think for a beep the loss would be more devastating I think there's a lot riding on this fight for him in his country you know it's country you know the weight of his country is on his back and things like that I think I think it is it a really damage could be brands and or I think McGregor could lose the fight and still be just as loved and just as huge of a of a Idol agency has that effect that people want to watch him no matter he could be doing Dancing with the Stars and I guarantee you the ratings will go up he's just he just has it so like I said McGregor can lose this and come back and ivory mentioned be just as big or go do some wild you know 185 pound fight and be just as big were khabib I think just everything's riding on this for him they would it would definitely affect a beach star power losing this fight for Conor to win he has to not could be about that's true but Kobe doesn't have to knock or rather Kobe doesn't have to take a corner down could be it cannot Conor out quite easily he could and definitely on the ground I believe he'll be able to control and dominate him and do some damage you know the same narrative was out there before steep a and Daniel Cormier fought that Cormier had to take him down and steep a had to lock him out that's close except that the the grappler can

be and won't even tries well I would look at it from the other perspective it would be a very positive for whichever one wins you know they truly are fighting over who the who the best featherweight in the world is or light with me rather you know there's nobody that disagrees there's no guys in the locker room in the back town getting a life that should be my spot everybody stood back and they go no you have to light guys go figure it out so whoever wins it's gonna be a tremendous boost I don't know the loser will they don't we send it to my of his you know credibility fight it'll be a good night for one of them the fact of the matter is as much as there's so much for for each one to wit to gain there's also a lot for each one from if McGregor loses in my opinion he will retire if Habib loses this fight not only does he lose his undefeated record but these losses to someone like McGregor when the temperature has been raised when the emotion is worldwide emotion these losses are

the floor then again and then he will win here and maybe if it's gonna be a knockout kickboxing style it would be Conor McGregor yeah and that you know the name by the way of this half know that it's called Papa Papa one more time Papa that's pretty good that's pretty good yeah and then who does it look better on me or happy go if you want yes acaba had leukemia the pier ability is owned by Roberto had no yeast colony does must be that a group of a person owns a coffee Beauty ballet bonuses a corner where the boy is a corner these two guys uf play is close enough and yet these guys to UFC fight is this one to champion these guys from Russia and this guy this guy this guy's kind of McGregor okay if these guys had a fight who would you think would win what yeah because it was

right that's logic for you there you go so we've actually managed to find Habib's first training partner so who do you thinks gonna win on Saturday yeah thanks very much yeah me too yeah so as you can see there's still some questions to be answered will it be a stand up fight that's more suited to Conor McGregor or down on the ground more suited to her be here in the very center of Moscow they don't know whether it's gonna be a knockout or a points win it's still a split decision the scary thing about that part is every round starts on its feet and that's scary for a khabees women whether says there's great fighters and then there's god-gifted fighters and I believe that Connor and Abby are both god-gifted fighters they're very special men and and when you're dealing with a gifted fighter it's hard to bet against them so what I want to do is is just watch as a fan because I really I really cannot choose look if I had to bet my house on the fight I won't be able to make the bet this fight this who knows what's gonna happen that's what makes it such a special fight I think that it's gonna be tremendous I think it could go two very different ways either McGregor keeping it on the feet and scoring a knockout or it could be getting it to the ground round after round and when in the victory and a five-round decision Italy to be knock out on early rounds or decision I'm a fan of both of them even though could be a Zonk Daniel Cormier steam I'm still a fan and and I'm just excited to see how relevant question lies I'm not rooting for anybody I think for a beep the loss would be more devastating I think there's a lot riding on this fight for him this country you know this country you know the weight of his country's on his back of his I think I think it really damaged the Beeb's Brandt and his kind of or I think McGregor could lose the fight and still be just as loved and just as huge of a of a idol he's just he has that effect that people want to watch him no matter he could be doing Dancing with the Stars and I guarantee you the ratings will go up he's just he just has it so like I said McGregor can lose this and come back and a rematch and be just as big or go home do some wild you know 185 pound fight and be just as big or could be I think just everything's riding on this for him they would it would definitely affect a beep star power losing this fight for Conor to win he has to not could be about that's true but Toby doesn't have to knock or rather could be doesn't have to take Connor down could be it cannot Connor out quite easily he could and definitely on the ground I believe he'll be able to control and dominate him and do some damage you know the same there too was out there before steep a and Daniel Cormier fought that Cormier had to take him down and steep ahead and lock him out that's close except that the the grappler can always knock the other going out right the one guy cannot both guys can always knock the other one out in this case Conor cannot take down could be Ben won't even try and canter Conor cannot submit to be and won't even tries well I would look at it from the other perspective it would be a very positive for whichever one wins you know they truly are fighting over who could be the best featherweight in the world is light with a rather you know there's no big that disagrees there's no guys in the locker room the back being like that should be my spot everybody stood back and they go no you are the two right guys go figure it out so whoever wins it's gonna be a tremendous boost I don't know that the loser will then it'll rescind it too much of his you know credibility but it'll be a good night for one of them the fact of the matter is as much as there's so much for for each one to wit to gain there's also a lot for each one to lose if McGregor loses in my opinion he will retire if Habib loses this fight not only does he lose his undefeated record but these losses to someone like

that's pretty good yeah and who does it look bad around me or a peep yeah you can go if you want every periodical ability wall is owned by Roberto mother must be that a group of across the music of Liberty Bell illness is a corner wicked boy as a corner miss you guys uf play is close enough yeah these guys to UFC fight is this one champion these guys from Russia and this guy's so this guy's punim ago again okay and if these guys had a fight bujji thing again because it is tattooed so who this guy yeah he's the best looking really okay nice oh yeah well thank you very much this pose it okay see you later later I'm not gonna he's not here to Pauline exact evolved in Somalia boy watching we said we Sammy oh cool push me that guy's called Habib nurmagomedov he's from Dagestan and Russia by mine who would you maybe want to see you I don't know I don't care I told but as I know my Gregor I guess I know my Greg Irwin yeah despite this guy's got a nice hat let's go pop Parker by the way what a parka Bob ha ha no idea I'm gonna try it you wanna try say Papa Bob Barker's that's too bad let's not survive the severe consider any Spanish yeah Papa do you know these two guys not oh yeah that's me yeah yeah I've shaved we shaved very well yeah huh he's not your buddy weights so Mutambara is a habima the FG you know is hot like yours do you know what it's called the papasa ha yeah have a go Papa Papa Papa pretty good thank you very much yeah I don't know I guess that's logic for you there you go so we've actually managed to find Habib's first training partner so who do you thinks gonna win on Saturday yeah thanks very much hear me - yeah so as you can see there's still some questions to be answered will it be a stand-up fight as Morsi it's a Conor McGregor or down on the ground Morsi into a beep here in the very center of Moscow they don't know whether it's gonna be a knockout for a points win it's still a split decision the scary thing about that fight is every round starts on its feet and that's scary for Kobe wondering whether says there's great fighters and then there's God gifted fighters and I believe that Conor and B are both positive letters a very special name and and when we're dealing with a guy who gets excited it's hard to bet against them so what I want to do is is just watch as a fan because I really I really cannot choose look if I had to bet my house on the fight I wouldn't be able to make the bet it's fire because who knows what's gonna happen that's one exercise especially I think that's gonna be tremendous I think you could go two very different ways either McGregor keeping it on the feet and scoring a knockout or could be getting it to the ground round after round and and went into victory and a five round decision it would be knockout run early round or a decision I'm a fan of both of them even though could be beyond Daniel Cormier steam I'm still a fan and and I'm just excited to see high level next question once I'm not rooting for anybody I think for a beep the loss would be more devastating I think there's a lot riding on this fight for his country you know it's country you know the weight of his country is on his back and things like that i think i think it really damaged Habib's brand and is kind of for I think McGregor couldn't lose the fight and still be just this loved and just as huge over of a Idol he's just he has that effect that people want to watch him no matter he could be doing Dancing with the Stars and I guarantee you the ratings will go up he's just he just has it so the mother said McGregor can lose this and come back and a rematch and be just as big or go do some wild you know 185 pound fight and be just as big worth Abebe I think just everything's riding on this for him I hated it would definitely affect a beeps our power losing this fight for Conor to win he has to not could be about that's truly but Kobe doesn't have to knock or rather Kobe doesn't have to take a corner down for beat cannot Conor out quite easily he could and definitely on the ground I believe he'll be able to control and dominate him and do some damage you know the same narrative was out there before steep a and Daniel Cormier fought that Cormier had to take him down and steep a head to lock him out that's close except that the grappler can always knock the other guy out right one guy come up both guys can always knock the other one out in this case Conor cannot take down could be banned won't even try and canter Conor cannot submit to be and won't even tries well I would look at it from the other perspective it would be a very positive for whichever one wins you know they truly are fighting over who the who the best featherweight in the world is or light weight rather you know there's nobody that disagrees there's no guys in the locker room in the back town Dana White that should be my spot everybody stood back and they go no you are the two right guys go figure it out so whoever wins it's going to be a tremendous boost I don't know the loser will better don't rescind it too much of his you know credibility but it'll be a good night for one of them the fact of the matter is as much as there is so much for for each one to wit to gain there's also a lot for each one to lose if McGregor loses in my opinion he will retire if Habib loses this fight not only does he lose his undefeated record but these losses to someone like McGregor when the temperature has been raised when the emotion is worldwide emotion these losses are painful they change a fighter forever look what happened to Jose Aldo a loss for Habib isn't just his first loss it's a loss to an archenemy it's a loss to somebody that every one of his fans wants him to destroy it's a loss to someone he thinks as a clown it's a loss to someone he thinks doesn't belong there with them do you follow what I'm saying when you face Conor McGregor the stakes are much much higher this the mental warfare game when you face Conor McGregor is fascinating and it is a huge part of every fight everybody who fights Conor McGregor thinks oh I won't let him under my skin everybody he penetrates into the mind of every fighter that he faces what he does is he elevates the temperature he raises the stress and the pressure and the consequences and the meaning of the fight and he does it very successfully and it affects everybody will it affect Habib I believe it will but will it affect him enough this is the question when you see Habib and he is already talking about you know he looks somewhat emotional he's already talking about when I see Conor McGregor we will fight that is somebody who's already on your mind he's already on a Beebe's mind you know I hear this question everywhere as if there are only two possibilities Conor will knock out Habib with his left hand or Habib will take down Conor and grind him out for a few rounds before but that's insanity somehow we create this a narrative that only these two things are possible but this Habib absolutely positively can knock out Conor McGregor a hundred percent it is 100% possible we talked about his ground game we talked about move regular striking game but it's only a few years back he knocked out Thiago Tavares dropped him with one punch and Thiago was backing up Conor McGregor could submit a bijnor mega-mega it's the same concept as to be knocking out McGregor we find these narratives these simplified narratives that we have to discuss if Connor can defend the takedown or if you're beep can close the distance and as if that's all that has to happen which is days to go before the biggest fight in MMA between happy an amalgam out-of-hand Conor McGregor we're here in the center of Moscow to see what the public knows about the fight and who the backing let's go so do you know these two guys beep beep yeah so you think a beef will win yeah if he can take corner on the floor yes he will win okay so do you know these two guys just kind of what about the guy on the right I need to guess frankly speaking you could you pick a winner from each one I saw his fight so I know he's and do you good better not sit I'm sure thanks very much Wow who's not yet ik Duke waiter Biba corn and chicken Messimer not quite uh-huh I'll be exact of all boots ability opportunity yeah okay so you know who these two guys are this is mr lumic tomato yeah yeah let's put McGregor yeah and they're gonna fight this weekend know who you gonna be support and who's gonna win I'm not supporting I can't choose because he's the better wrestler and he's the better spend the boxer so so if it goes to the floor then it's going to be a knockout the cooking style it would be forever yeah and that you know the name by the way at this huh it's called Papa Papa one more time that's pretty good yeah and then who does it look at around me know if you have any other peer ability war is all very great work at the US economy does must be that the Google personals at about with Isabella bonuses a corner where the boyars economist you guys uf play is close enough yeah these guys to UFC fighters this one champion this guy's from Russia and this guy's so this guy's Conor McGregor okay and if these guys had a fight who do you think would win what because it was tattooed so who this guy partly yeah he's the best-looking okay nice oh yeah well thank you very much dispose yet I'm that guy see I'm better-looking a Conor McGregor Eagle have that Conor he's no idea to fun in Cabo Verde Valley oh boy oh boy - no we said we sang which one that guy's called khabib nurmagomedov he's from Dagestan in Russia who would you maybe want to see win I don't know I don't care at all but as I know Conor McGregor I guess I prefer my Gregor window yeah this path this guy's got a nice hat it's called Parker by the way what a fucker ha ha ha no idea I'm gonna try it you wanna try and say it Papa fuckers that's too bad that's not too bad the supermarket Oh consider any Spanish yeah yeah pasa yeah do you know these two guys no not oh yeah that's me that's me yeah yeah yeah I've shaved you shaved so you should very well yeah the last two hours aha with an active unique boy narrative this variant premier animo graduated magna Merrick Garland's video as a valium no matter about him Rodia immediately which move which way it's not affable so Mutambara is a filament the F do you know he's hot like yours do you know what is let's go to Papa yeah Papa Papa Papa pretty good thank you very much yeah I don't know the ripe ones I guess the right that's logic for you there you go so I've actually managed to find Habib's first trading partner so who do you thinks gonna win on Sade yeah thanks very much hear me - yeah so as you can see there's still some questions to be answered will it be a stand-up fight that's more suited to Conor McGregor or down on the ground more see it to be here in the very center of Moscow they don't know whether it's gonna be a knockout or a points win it's still a split decision the scary thing about that fight is every round starts on its feet and that's scary but to be whether whether said there's great fighters and then there's God get your fighter and I believe that Conor and we both get there very special man and when you're dealing with a fighter how the bet against so what I want to do is just watch as a fan I really I really cannot choose that if I had to bet my house on the fighter I wouldn't be able to make the bet it's like this who knows what's gonna happen as we make such a special place I think the fights gonna be tremendous I think it could go to very different ways either McGregor keeping it on the feet and it's born a knockout or could be getting it to the ground round after round and and went into victory and a five round decision Italy would be knocked out on early round or decision I'm a fan of both of them even though the Beeb's on Daniel Cormier steams I'm still a fan and and I'm excited you have a little bit specialized I'm not rooting for anybody I think for a bead the loss would be more devastating there's a lot riding on this fight for him in his country you know this country you know he's on his back of his I think I think that is it a really see damage could be Branson and his on it for us I think McGregor could lose the fight and still be just as loves injustice huge of of a Idol because he has that effect where people wanna watch him no matter he could be doing Dancing with the Stars I guarantee the ratings will go up he's just he just has it so medicine record is use this and come back and a ream answers be just a big or go home do some wild you know 185-pound try didn't do to see big where could be I think this everything's right on this pillow they would definitely perfect Habib star power moving this place but car turtle when he has do not to be about that's true but to be doesn't have to knock or rather could be doesn't have to take corner down to be cannot Connor out quite easily he could and definitely on the ground I believe he'll be able to control and dominate in the do some damage you know the same narrative was out there before steep a and Daniel homeopathic homie I had to take him down and steep any heavy walking out that's close except that's the grappler can always knock the other guy out right the one guy cannot but hold guys can always knock the other one out in this case Conor cannot take down could be that won't even try and canter Conor cannot submit to be and won't even tries well I would look at from Heather perspective it would be a very positive for whichever one wins you know they truly are fighting over who did who the best featherweight in the world is a light with it rather you know there's nobody that disagrees there's no guys in the locker room in the back time doing the light that should be my spot everybody stood back and they go no you are the two right guys go figure it out so whoever wins it's going to be a tremendous boost I don't know the loser will then it'll rescind it too much of his you know credibility but it'll be a good night for to gain there's also a lot for each one to lose if McGregor loser the people in Manila octo comedy Jessica a commemorative pure vegetable was on my way to had no a second with us - Oh Connor McGregor must be that a group of a person owns a cup of booty ballet bones to the corner where the boy is a corner you know these two guys us play is close enough and yeah these guys - UFC fight is this one for chunka these guys from Russia and this guy is tremendous back so this guy's Conor McGregor okay and if these guys had a fight do you think would win because it was tattooed so who this guy yeah he was the best-looking best-looking this guy really okay nice oh yeah well thank you very much disposed yet hi guy see I'm better-looking a Conor McGregor eagle I'm not gonna he's ninety eighty pardon it's like of all the booty but yet we service a me a cooler Nutan bigger than is he gonna which was to this guy's got a nice let's go by the way what's up Papa no idea I'm gonna try it you wanna try and see it yeah yeah the dragon when you face this dental work you see this dish very separate with the city my son second check we on foxsports1 round us around and and when in the victory and a five round decision it'll either be knockout on early rounds or a decision I'm a fan of both of them even though could be Jean Daniel Cormier steam I'm still a fan and and I'm just excited to see how to live with an expressionless I'm not rooting for anybody I think for Habib the loss would be more devastating I think there's a lot riding on this fight for him his country you know it's country you know the weight of his country is on his back and things like that i think i think it really damaged the Beeb's brand and his kind of aura I think McGregor could lose the fight and still be just as loved and just as huge of a of a idol he's just he has that it factor people want to watch him no matter he could be doing Dancing with the Stars and I guarantee you the ratings will go up he's just he just has it so like I said McGregor can lose this and come back and a rematch and be just as big or go do some wild you know 185 pound fight and be just as big were could be I think just everything's riding on this for him you know hey they would it would definitely affect a beep star power losing this fight for Conor to win he has to not could be about that's true but Kabhi doesn't have to knock or rather could be doesn't have to take Connor down could be cannot Conor out quite easily he could and definitely on the ground I believe he'll be able to control and dominate him and do some damage you know the same narrative was out there before steep a and Daniel Cormier fought that Cormier had to take him down and steep a had to lock him out that's close except that the the grappler can always knock the other guy out right the one guy cannot both guys can always knock the other one out in this case Conor cannot takedown could be even won't even try and canter Conor cannot submit khabib and won't even try well I would look at it from the other perspective it would be a very positive for whichever one wins you know they truly are fighting over who the who the best featherweight in the world is or light would rather you know there's nobody that disagrees there's no guy
