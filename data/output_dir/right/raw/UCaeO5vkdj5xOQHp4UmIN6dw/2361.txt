00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latest polls are out and voters seem</font>

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,959
to be making up their minds that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'd</font>

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,850
prefer to have a gangster as president

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,160
rather than a psycho the gangster is

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,809
leading the psycho by double digits in

6
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,940
some polls while in state polls the

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,920
gangster looks as if she may win states

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,750
that would normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the psycho if</font>

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,400
he weren't such a<font color="#CCCCCC"> psycho where his</font>

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,900
gangster<font color="#E5E5E5"> states will vote for the</font>

11
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,850
gangster even knowing she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gangster</font>

12
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,560
for fear if they switch to the psycho

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,439
he'll turn out to be psycho news that

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,300
the psycho had recommended assassinating

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the gangster shocked many potential</font>

16
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,810
psycho voters who thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant the</font>

17
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,820
psycho was psycho whereas news that the

18
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,530
gangster might already be involved in an

19
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,870
actual assassination did not disturb the

20
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,520
gangster voters because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

21
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,280
knew that gangster was a gangster but

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,960
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the media since most</font>

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,879
journalists are gangsters they tend to

24
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,920
treat gangster behavior as normal when

25
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,809
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> became clear for instance that the</font>

26
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,579
gangster had been influence peddling

27
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,590
destroying government documents and

28
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,110
repeatedly lying the gangster said well

29
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,360
sure she's just being a gangster but

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,920
when the psycho made a joke about a

31
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,750
crying baby the gangsters started

32
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,670
screaming<font color="#E5E5E5"> that guy is psycho they said</font>

33
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,379
you'd never<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a gangster that psycho</font>

34
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,640
although of course since they're all

35
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,680
gangsters if gangsters were psycho they

36
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,909
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know because they'd be too</font>

37
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,799
psycho because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're all a bunch of</font>

38
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,590
gangsters now to be fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the media</font>

39
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,810
gangsters though they are gangsters they

40
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,000
do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a point over the years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,500
gangsters have run<font color="#CCCCCC"> for president but</font>

42
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,479
only the occasional psycho and whereas

43
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,130
the gangsters party is full of gangsters

44
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,320
the psychos party is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that psycho</font>

45
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,180
that's why the psychos party won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

46
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,770
the psycho when he psycho but the

47
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,090
gangster party backs their fellow

48
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,829
gangster when she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a gangster</font>

49
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">after a while you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get used to gangsters</font>

50
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,360
and you stop thinking they're psycho so

51
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,890
when the gangster announces she'll rip

52
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,020
off over a trillion dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> in taxes and</font>

53
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,720
funnel it into scams and power grabs we

54
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,399
all think well yeah of course she's a

55
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,829
gangster but then the psycho says he'll

56
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,990
restrict illegal immigration because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

57
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,970
gangster<font color="#CCCCCC"> coddles illegal gangsters which</font>

58
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,619
is psycho and everyone starts shouting

59
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,270
the psycho is<font color="#CCCCCC"> psycho and the gangster</font>

60
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,829
cycle and the psycho is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually saying</font>

61
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,140
well wait no he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying he's psycho</font>

62
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,939
but he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not helping the gangsters which</font>

63
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,310
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be psycho like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gangster</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

64
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,530
the same many Americans have begun

65
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,659
asking themselves how did we get stuck

66
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,399
with a choice between a psycho and a

67
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">gangster are we psycho are we gangsters</font>

68
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,740
or are we just so sick of<font color="#E5E5E5"> gangsters</font>

69
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,270
we thought we'd settle for a psycho but

70
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,150
then realized why not that psycho in any

71
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,620
case according to the polls it now

72
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,300

to be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that scene in the horror</font>

117
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,210
movie where the guy has a nightmare and

118

then he wakes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then boo he's still</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would destroy any candidate on</font>

124
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,000
earth and then Donald Trump opens his

125
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,858
mouth and says something incredibly

126
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,959

this event right near Orlando

186
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,520

193
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,740
they put him behind Hillary Clinton

194
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,620
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's looks diverse as they would</font>

195
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,880
say he looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> at verse he's kind of</font>

196
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,590
brownish and has<font color="#CCCCCC"> he let you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

197
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,510
looks like does he look like he looks

198
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,880
like you know a Taliban guy and so they

199
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,800
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> him in back of a back of her and of</font>

200
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,919
course he supports her because you know

201
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">she wants the borders to be open so if</font>

202
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,639
you want your warrior brothers to become

203
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,740
pouring into the country you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> go for</font>

204
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,500
Hillary that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so now Trump makes the</font>

205
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,120
perfectly reasonable you were we all

206
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember when donald trump was asked to</font>

207
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,680
disavow David Duke and disavow anybody

208
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,180
who comes near him who says things that

209
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't like and of course Trump</font>

210
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,280
famously dropped the David Duke ball you

211
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">know he didn't disavow the Ku Klux Klan</font>

212
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,300
and Jake Tapper was practically begging

213
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,550
him but he makes the point this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

214
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,770
second cut cut to he makes the point

215
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,060
that he gets slightly different

216
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,010
treatment and I saw the picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of him</font>

217
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,389
with a red hat but didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have make</font>

218
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,760
America great on it by the way and she

219
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,030
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not disavow and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that were me this</font>

220
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,590
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a headline all over the world</font>

221
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,960
about Trump but she did not as i

222
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,110
understand it disavow this man and he's

223
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,300
got some pretty harsh views so I think

224
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,580
it's look it's a whole double standard

225
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,349
but we're punching through it and I

226
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:12,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the people understand i really</font>

227
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,520
think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people understand well you</font>

228
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,159
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that hillary was</font>

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,420
he says but he started talking about

<font color="#E5E5E5">this guy Seth rich he's 27 year old DNC</font>

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,520
Washington early July and the police say

325
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,350
well it looked like robbery except

326
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,180
according to his parents nothing was

327
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,070
stolen so and there was a look like

328
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,810
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a fight and all this stuff now</font>

329
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,430
Julian Assange you all remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

330
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,400
released these DNC emails that he had

331
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,550
hacked and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DEA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that showed that the</font>

332
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,680
DNC was conspiring against Bernie

333
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,090
Sanders to make sure that Hillary

334
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,860
Clinton won the nomination he goes on

335
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,320
Dutch TV and he has this to say about

336
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,380
the death<font color="#E5E5E5"> the murder of Seth rich as a</font>

337
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,100
27 year old I works for the DNC who shot

339
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,350
from unknown reasons as he was walking

down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> street</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in Washington so that</font>

was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a rubbery I'd leaf wasn't it no</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's there's no finding so that is</font>

343
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,250
distorting what are you suggesting I'm

344
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,190
suggesting that our sources are take

345
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,050
risks and they are they become concerned

346
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:50,260
to see things occurring like that but

347
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,140
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> he one of your sources then I mean</font>

348
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,680
we don't call

349
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">menton here our sources I like the</font>

350
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,120
suggestion about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> young guy being shall</font>

351
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,130
in the streets<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Washington because</font>

352
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,980
that we have to understand how high the

353
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,029
stakes are in the United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font>

354
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:10,990
our sources are you know our sources

355
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,180
face serious risks that's why they come

356
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us so we can protect their anonymity</font>

357
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,880
that's quite something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to suggest a</font>

358
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,110
murder that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what you're</font>

359
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing well that others have have</font>

360
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,330
suggested that we are investigating if

361
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,330
you understand what happened in that

362
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,320
situation with Seth rich I think it is a

363
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,020
concerning situation there's not a

364
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,140
conclusion yet we wouldn't be willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

365
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,550
state a conclusion but we are concerned

366
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,529
about it and more<font color="#CCCCCC"> importantly a variety</font>

367
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,839
of resources are concerned when that

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing happens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so he's</font>

372
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,260

twenty-five-thousand-dollar reward that

374
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,980
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> already up so that's Hillary's day</font>

okay so Hillary's day is got the

00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,330
killer's dad behind her the cetera

377
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,390
supporting dad behind her got you no new

378
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,950
emails showing she's selling government

379
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,440
secrets she's been accused by an

380
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,140
important figure of being possibly

381
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,880
involved in an assassination here's

382
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,800
Donald Trump taking advantage of this he

383
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,540
gets up and he starts to talk about the

384
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,190
comparison between<font color="#E5E5E5"> his policies and</font>

385
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,650
Hillary's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hillary wants to raise taxes</font>

386
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,950
it's a comparison I went to lower<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hilary</font>

387
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,140
wants to expand regulations which he

388
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,170
does big league can you believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

389
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,690
will reduce them very very substantially

390
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,750
could be as much as 70 75 percent

391
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,580
Hilary wants to shut down energy

392
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:50,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">production I want to expand it lower</font>

we don't want you know these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are real</font>

406

people we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want that you know what</font>

407
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,590
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Hillary Clinton I do think</font>

408
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,150
she's a gangster I still don't want her

411
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,850
and of course that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the headline even</font>

412
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,590
in the Wall Street Journal that's the

413
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,240
headline all this stuff about Hillary

414
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,150
wiped away and they give he gives the

415
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,150
press the excuse to be as biased as they

416
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,580
are they are biased like Rudy Giuliani's

417
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,350
excuse was if he<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know knowing Donald</font>

418
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,460
Trump if he'd meant to tell you to

assassinate her he<font color="#E5E5E5"> just would have said</font>

420
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,270
said it so what he's saying the guy's

421
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,160
such a loose cannon that he just would

422
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,450
have come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and said all right listen</font>

sequels and superhero movies<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

438
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,840
question I get it a lot movies have

439
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,360
always sucked up material they've always

440
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,370
been based on books on plays on other

441
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,790
things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they continue to be I am what</font>

442
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,650
movies have lost the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

443
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,300
movies used to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make good</font>

444
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">movies that people saw now they make</font>

445
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,370
good movies and they make tentpole

446
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,230
movies and those movies are not the same

447
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,780
entertainment movies and serious movies

448
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,609
are now no longer the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same and when they</font>

449
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,380
made Casablanca that's one of the

450
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,449
greatest movies ever made that's a hit

451
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:12,459
gone with the wind these are old movies

452
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:13,299
at

453
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,909
art forms<font color="#CCCCCC"> peek at an art form speak the</font>

454
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,888
popular and the great are the same

455
00:17:17,888 --> 00:17:19,509
people crowded into theaters to see

456
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:21,789
Shakespeare's plays you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know now a play</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> serious play gets six people well</font>

458
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,689
everybody goes and sees lame is for the

459
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:27,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">17th time you know that's what happens</font>

460
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:29,799
when an<font color="#E5E5E5"> art form starts to die movies</font>

463
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,360
TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> now on TV you can make good dramas</font>

464
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,980
that people will watch and that cause

465
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,049
excitement and all that I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

466
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:42,850
concerned i have to admit by the

467
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,450
childishness of all entertainment all

468
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,690
the comic book<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know</font>

469
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,529
the fantasy stuff there is no drama for

470
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:56,230
young people to go see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is actually</font>

471
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,929
about real people doing real stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

472
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:00,159
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> last night I was out in the streets</font>

473
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:02,619
of Westwood in LA and they're

474
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:04,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">celebrating sausage party and I thought</font>

475
00:18:04,629 --> 00:18:06,460
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> well there's a film classic if</font>

476
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,499
there was one and I'm not I'm not being

477
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:10,149
a snob I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just saying you know they're</font>

478
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:12,580
there should be a wider range and movies

479
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,519
have just gotten focused into this very

480
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,379
narrow corridor<font color="#CCCCCC"> of childish</font>

481
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:19,029
entertainment and yes I do think that

482
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:20,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is a sign that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the art form is</font>

483
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,989
aging and is starting to become less and

484
00:18:22,989 --> 00:18:25,480
less relevant all right from Logan are

485
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,970
hey andrew i'm glad you turn to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jesus</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">but maybe also of me I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know I'm</font>

488
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,119
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> fourteen so here is a big debate</font>

489
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,830
between Christians about if you should

490
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,749
take the Bible literally I think you

491
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,210
should what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think here is what i</font>

492
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,249
think i will<font color="#E5E5E5"> only discuss this briefly</font>

493
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:43,899
i'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into a lot of</font>

494
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:46,419
specifics nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes anything</font>

495
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:48,159
literally nobody language is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

496
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:50,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">literal thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay unless you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

497
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,419
about mathematics people say they take

498
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:53,739
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bible literally but they're not</font>

499
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:56,590
quite thinking it through<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jesus</font>

500
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,090
says to Peter<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the resurrection</font>

501
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:01,330
feed my sheep if Peter said with grass

502
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,190
or you know you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what what do</font>

503
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want me to give me know what do they</font>

504
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:06,039
eat you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think like what</font>

505
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,080
is he nuts obviously Jesus isn't talking

506
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,239
about sheep we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that literally</font>

507
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:12,279
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jesus tells a parable and he starts</font>

508
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:14,499
at he says there was a man who had two

509
00:19:14,499 --> 00:19:17,739
sons nobody said to him what were<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

510
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,419
names where did he live but you know

511
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:21,609
what were they real were they real he

512
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:23,649
was making it up he was making it up

513
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:25,450
does that mean it's not true a

514
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,429
course it's true I believe I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> truly</font>

515
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:29,649
truly believe this<font color="#E5E5E5"> that every word in</font>

516
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:32,169
the Bible is true but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font>

517
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:34,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">every word in the Bible is literal truth</font>

518
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,039
there are such a<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing as Jean recipie</font>

519
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:38,620
express deep truths why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

520
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,750
people right myths for instance why do

521
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,120
they write novels because there's truths

522
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,730
that you can't express by simply

523
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,220
speaking literally that's why Jesus told

524
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,860
parables that's why he made up stories

525
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are parts of the Bible that I</font>

526
00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:54,940
believe belonged to other genres than

527
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">history there's parts of the Bible that</font>

528
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,760
I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> our history there's parts that</font>

529
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,710
I believe are not history<font color="#E5E5E5"> but are meant</font>

530
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:03,159
to express truth so deep that history

531
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:06,159
can't touch them and so I read different

532
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,929
parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Bible differently what I'm</font>

533
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:09,460
not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss today because it's</font>

534
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,830
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation for another day is which</font>

535
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,840
parts are which but though I will say

536
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,940
this i believe you can read the Bible as

537
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,340
absolute truth and still believe in

538
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,110
science which is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the great tools</font>

539
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,570
that God has<font color="#CCCCCC"> given us to understand the</font>

540
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:28,149
world<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright let's do another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one I do</font>

541
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:30,070
you have any advice for me or someone in

542
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,019
a similar type of situation basically

543
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:35,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is from Sam he is arguing how he's</font>

544
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,320
asking how do you argue with leftists

545
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,260
who simply won't listen to you now this

546
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,200
question I get all the time let me give

547
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,700
you a couple of pointers first of all

548
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,409
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide what you want if</font>

549
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:48,820
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convince somebody of</font>

550
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,070
something it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> different than if you're</font>

551
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,570
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to beat him in an argument</font>

552
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,580
beating someone an argument feels great

553
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,169
but it doesn't really accomplish

554
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:57,730
anything they're very few people who

555
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,380
will change their minds having been

556
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,809
beaten in an argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are people</font>

557
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:05,200
who can<font color="#E5E5E5"> will listen to you if you</font>

558
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">discuss with them there you know what</font>

559
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,490
you think versus what they think and

560
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,649
just hold them up together so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

561
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:12,880
thing I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

562
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,820
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussing if if your intent is to</font>

563
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,610
convince somebody don't be a jerk it's

564
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,559
tough I have to tell you it is tough

565
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,740
because I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very long fuse I can't</font>

566
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember the last time I got really</font>

567
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,429
angry even inside I mean I can remember

568
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:29,649
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a long time ago I'm not a guy</font>

569
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:31,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">who gets angry but I do get impatient</font>

570
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,190
when you talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people and they say</font>

571
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,129
dumb things you know when you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh you</font>

572
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,000
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they start telling you about</font>

573
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,880
poor Michael bruh

574
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,590
killed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the police or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever they</font>

575
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,930
say or yes I know a Muslim person and

576
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,940
he's swell certain we let all the Muslim

577
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,290
you know into the why should Donald

578
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,480
Trump be so mean you gotta stay patient

579
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,580
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to stay patient and I confess</font>

580
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you that I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always do it but I'm</font>

581
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">telling you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do what I say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not what I do</font>

582
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,200
that on that know the basics you know

583
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,450
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue frequently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not what's</font>

584
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,690
right and wrong but who decides so

585
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,950
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're arguing with somebody</font>

586
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,170
in there tell you oh the poor doing this

587
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,790
and you have to help the poor that's

588
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,850
true the question is who decides what's

589
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,340
right and wrong do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide in your do</font>

590
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,110
you get to live by your lights by your

591
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,510
conscience or does the government impose

592
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,950
that on you so those are basic things

593
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,510
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know know what you're talking about</font>

594
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,160
you have to know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> facts a lot of</font>

595
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">programs that sound great make people</font>

596
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">miserable you look at Detroit all you</font>

597
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,890
believe me those taxes that they took

598
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,300
from people in Detroit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gutted that</font>

599
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">city we're always for programs that</font>

600
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,870
sounded wonderful so if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

601
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,250
argue with something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to know</font>

602
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,500
the facts you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

603
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,970
principles you have to know the

604
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,950
principles of your of conservatism when

605
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,570
people say to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is one thing left</font>

606
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,970
is always say government<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do good</font>

607
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">things look at this government did this</font>

608
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,780
government anybody can do good<font color="#E5E5E5"> things a</font>

609
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,030
fascist dictator can do good things an

610
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,370
emperor can do good<font color="#E5E5E5"> things the point is</font>

611
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,990
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be free you want a</font>

612
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,970
government that's limited not because it

613
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,260
can't do good<font color="#E5E5E5"> things if it's unlimited</font>

614
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,210
it can do good<font color="#E5E5E5"> things but it's the very</font>

615
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,430
fact that it's unlimited is so bad that

616
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">it overcomes the good things that you do</font>

617
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,650
and also and this is with leftists the

618
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,850
the key the biggest key of all don't

619
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,310
discuss personalities don't argue about

620
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,990
what Donald Trump said don't argue about

621
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,520
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> george w bush that don't argue</font>

622
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,020
about whether this guy is<font color="#E5E5E5"> good or this</font>

623
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,540
guy is bad are you about principles and

624
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,460
facts that's all you are you about

625
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,550
because you know politicians stink they

626
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,140
do bad things they're corrupt they lie

627
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,640
all of them almost you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

628
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,080
there's I can't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one that I</font>

629
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,610
would just think yeah I would trust that

630
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,790
guy to walk away<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my daughter I</font>

631
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,230
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a politician I feel that</font>

632
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,370
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> about so don't argue about</font>

633
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,920
personalities and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep them to</font>

634
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,630
the subject<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the other thing to</font>

635
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,910
left this do left the skills be arguing

636
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,610
with them about welfare and you'll

637
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,870
destroy their argument and they'll say

638
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what about guns all you people</font>

639
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:49,880
have done

640
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,010
up and go all wait what happened to

641
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,900
welfare so those are like the rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

642
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,280
I use the most important one I have to

643
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,870
tell you is try not to be a jerk try to

644
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,820
discuss the thing with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person even</font>

645
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,350
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you lose your patience a little bit</font>

646
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,600
very tough to do all right let's move on

647
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,970
to stuff I like we've been talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

648
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,460
week about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways the foundations of</font>

649
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,990
our culture and then the reason I want

650
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about this is so you understand</font>

651
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,720
you know conservatives have this really

652
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,920
adversarial relationship with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arts</font>

653
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,920
they don't like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arts they feel quite</font>

654
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,870
rightly that left us to use the arts<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

655
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,820
propagandize for the left and they feel

656
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,960
well the answer is we have to

657
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,820
propagandize for the right and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

658
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is wrong I think what you have</font>

659
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do is you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find the truth in</font>

660
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,700
art art never<font color="#E5E5E5"> works unless there's truth</font>

661
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,350
in it it never<font color="#E5E5E5"> works less than there's</font>

662
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,770
truth in it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked about how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

663
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,200
culture grows out of Christianity it all

664
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,670
grows out of Christianity people who

665
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,470
think they are escaping Christianity are

666
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,450
almost always talking in Christian terms

667
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,770
they're almost always talking about

668
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,780
tolerance and forgiveness they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

669
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,610
leaving Christianity out of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

670
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,500
it leads them to places they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

671
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,840
to go and so they're always they're

672
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,580
always standing on the top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tower</font>

673
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,190
without accepting the foundation the

674
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,480
cornerstone of the tower they're like

675
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,910
wile e coyote if they look<font color="#E5E5E5"> down there's</font>

676
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,760
certainly going to go like<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoa fall 200</font>

677
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,610
feet so we've talked about how the West

678
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,410
deals with questions of the truth comes

679
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,910
right out of the Gospels we've talked

680
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how the West invented the idea of</font>

681
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the individual because of Christianity</font>

682
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,940
this is the thing that did not exist

683
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,730
before the west of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the West invented</font>

684
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,250
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the idea of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself as a</font>

685
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,380
worthwhile individual and finally I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

686
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,380
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the idea of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flesh</font>

687
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,140
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flesh and the spirit and</font>

688
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,710
the reason this is important is because

689
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,360
the question is which of them is a

690
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,280
metaphor is the flesh a metaphor that

691
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,330
represents something else or is

692
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,920
everything else a metaphor that

693
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,840
represents the flesh<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this comes</font>

694
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,110
these questions come right out of first

695
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,430
of all the gospel but they come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out in</font>

696
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,840
such a complicated way that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

697
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,400
time to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now but it's</font>

698
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,290
in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what Paul writes about he</font>

699
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,140
says you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in Galatians he says walk</font>

700
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,790
by the spirit and you will not gratify

701
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,860
the desires of the flesh for the flesh

702
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,080
desires what is contrary to the spirit

703
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,760
and the spirit was contrary to the flesh

704
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,640
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not complicated or</font>

705
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,990
arguable we all know if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> married</font>

706
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,429
you know that you promised<font color="#E5E5E5"> your wife</font>

707
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:11,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you weren't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to sleep with</font>

708
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:13,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">other people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font>

709
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,929
sometimes not to sleep with other people

710
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:17,299
the flesh insists on it it tells you

711
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:19,700
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are violating some principle of</font>

712
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,230
life<font color="#CCCCCC"> after about the 17th century after</font>

713
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,390
Newton basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> after science there</font>

714
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">came to be what is called but CS Lewis</font>

715
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:30,500
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> T I can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even remember what he</font>

716
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,450
called it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the great in returning or</font>

717
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,799
the great internalization I think he

718
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,360
called it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea was that</font>

719
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,130
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we thought was done by</font>

720
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,630
God everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we thought was done</font>

721
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,610
by the spirit was actually related to

722
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,559
the flesh<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everybody started creating</font>

723
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,250
systems in which everything became a

724
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,110
symbol of metaphor for the flesh the

725
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">most important one and the most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> famous</font>

726
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:52,669
one is Sigmund Freud who said you know

727
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:55,070
that's a phallic symbol you're smoking

728
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,740
that cigar because it reminds you<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

729
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,990
male member you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind</font>

730
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,490
of thing you're saying these things but

731
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,110
even it's always about sex it always

732
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,620
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to sex</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is now that</font>

733
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,730
has been transformed now into

734
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,559
evolutionary biology where we say you

735
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:11,090
find that beautiful you find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> girl</font>

736
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,010
beautiful because that she's throwing

737
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:16,460
off signs that she is fertile you know

738
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,250
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find you'll hear you they will truly</font>

739
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,380
say to you you find a sunrise beautiful

740
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,419
because man is safer during the day and

741
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:24,860
you say well why<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I find a sunset</font>

742
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,980
beautiful then well because man is safer

743
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,600
during the night in his cave I don't

744
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,889
know you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean because they they</font>

745
00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:33,740
explain everything in terms of the flesh

746
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,559
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question is is that right or is</font>

747
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,899
the flesh itself a metaphor for

748
00:27:38,899 --> 00:27:40,610
something more important as the flesh<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

749
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,049
the thing are the things that happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

750
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:45,110
you in your life symbolize do they

751
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,029
symbolize something more important than

752
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:49,190
your physical being because you can't

753
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,070
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a moral world unless life</font>

754
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,080
extends beyond life we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all know that</font>

755
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,870
life is unfair a 20 year old who goes to

756
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,330
war and get shot down so that maybe

757
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,519
people can be free that's not fair

758
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,380
that's not right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we all kind of</font>

759
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,120
assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's something bigger</font>

760
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,120
that he is serving and that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

761
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,610
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reward system in heaven we</font>

762
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,710
have lost that faith in the spirit<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

763
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,870
has gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the arts and you can see</font>

764
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">and where you see this most</font>

765
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:17,960
is in supernatural stories me

766
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,460
supernatural stories tend to deal

767
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,429
directly with the spirit if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font>

768
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:25,220
vampires for just for instance we have

769
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">an image</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I brought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this is this</font>

770
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,389
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference between the vampire</font>

771
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:32,330

772
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,690
a damned soul he had lost his soul that

773
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">was what was horrifying about being a</font>

vampire you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were just you had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

775
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,200
become a hungry creature a hungry animal

776
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,570
basically now because we've lost that

777
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,610
he's now a sexy guy from twilight right

778
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,200
with the twinkly sparkles when he comes

779
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,610
along because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't think of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him as</font>

780
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,049
having lost us all we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of them</font>

781
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:52,879
as having some kind of disease almost

782
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:55,249
the where where you see this most

783
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:57,440
importantly is in zombie stories the

784
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,629
reason zombie stories are now so popular

785
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:00,980
the reason they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say the</font>

786
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,289
central supernatural story that is being

787
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:05,149
told the central horror story that is

788
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:08,029
being told is because they are quite an

789
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:11,179
honest reflection of what a<font color="#CCCCCC"> man becomes</font>

790
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:13,879
if we really believe he<font color="#E5E5E5"> has no soul he</font>

791
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:17,119
becomes and he becomes food and he

792
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:19,070
becomes the person who eats the food

793
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,990
there's no reason not to eat a human

794
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">body the only reason that you're in body</font>

795
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:24,529
is because you respect it as a

796
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,749
receptacle of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Spirit take a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

797
00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:28,940
the first and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> greatest zombie film</font>

798
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,409
night of the living dead the acting is

799
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:32,179
bad but the film is incredible this is

800
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:34,159
how it opens with a brother and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sister</font>

801
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,539
in a graveyard and in the background

802
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:37,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we will later find out as a zombie</font>

803
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,830
is walking<font color="#CCCCCC"> around and the brother is</font>

804

00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,820

822
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,120
them now turns out to be a zombie who

823
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,220
then immediately devours the brother

824
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,770
because this guy having left the<font color="#E5E5E5"> church</font>

825

827
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,600
body<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's an eating screwing machine</font>

828
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,000
that really has no concern for the

829
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,700
higher things and this is what that that

830
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,010
vision<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a zombie apocalypse as we've</font>

831
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,870
now come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it is a vision of the</font>

832
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,090
world what it would be like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we truly</font>

833
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">stopped believing in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the spirit that's</font>

834

why today my stuff I like is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixth</font>

835
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:10,029
sense one of my favorite<font color="#CCCCCC"> movies one of</font>

836
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:11,320
my favorite ghost story movies at love

837
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,059
ghost stories excellent performance by

838
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:15,399
Bruce Willis<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exchange the</font>

839
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:17,200
famous exchange between Bruce Willis a

840
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,179
psychiatrist and a little boy that he

841
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:20,860
who is troubled and he's come to treat

842
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,690
him and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the little boy to finally tells</font>

843
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,640
him what it is that's bothering him<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

844
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,409
remember a psychiatrist is a Freudian

845
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:28,510
who is used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to taking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that</font>

846
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,210
you think are spiritual and teaching you

847
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,159
that they're really about your desires

848
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:34,960
and your libido and your flesh and

849
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suddenly those two points of view</font>

850
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,279
come smack into each other

851
00:31:55,389 --> 00:32:07,329
I see dead<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in your dreams why</font>

852
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:09,839
you're awake

853
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:18,369
did people like in graves and coffins

854
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:22,489
walking around<font color="#CCCCCC"> like regular people we</font>

855
00:32:22,489 --> 00:32:25,759
don't see each other they only see what

856
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:31,659
they want to see they don't know that

857
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:41,570
how often<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you see them oh died the</font>

858
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,820
look on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Willis's face says it all he</font>

859
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,500
hears that and he knows as a trained

860
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,090
psychiatrist he knows this kid is

861
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,890
psychotic he's having a psychotic break

862
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,830
because if you see dead people something

863
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,720
is terribly terribly<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with you and</font>

864
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,490
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the moment when he realized</font>

865
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,200
this is this kid is truly sick although

866
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,960
as we know as we watch the movie<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so</font>

867
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,510
much and there's an entire theology even

868
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,890
in that one scene but there's an entire

869
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,450
theology in this movie that's really

870
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,010
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting in deep we don't time</font>

871
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,179
to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but it's worth watching</font>

872
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:10,190
and the reason the film works by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

873
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,530
is because of this conflict you can see

874
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,570
this film two and three<font color="#E5E5E5"> times and even</font>

875
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,220
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the ending which is</font>

876
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,380
obviously this big you know twist ending

877
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,750
when you know the ending the film still

878
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,980
works because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this relationship</font>

879
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">between the psychiatrist and the child</font>

880
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:26,780
that's all we have time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomorrow is</font>

881
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,490
our last day already<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the clave</font>

882
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,289
endless weekend looms it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an it's</font>

883
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:32,750
like a horrible cloud on the horizon but

884
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,309
there's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> day left and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll do what</font>

885
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:36,620
we can to stave off the disaster i'm
