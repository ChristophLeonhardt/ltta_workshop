1
00:00:02,061 --> 00:00:04,364
RALLYING AHEAD OF THE MID-TERMS.

2
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:08,501
HERE TO REACT, DR. SEBASTIAN

3
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:10,703
GORKA, FORMER 2012 PRESIDENTIAL

4
00:00:10,703 --> 00:00:12,605
CANDIDATE AND CHAIRMAN OF THE

5
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:15,008
AMERICA FIGHTING BACKPACK.

6
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:17,443
HERMAN CAIN AND FORMER

7
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:20,246
INTELLIGENCE ANALYST MORGAN

8
00:00:20,246 --> 00:00:20,613
ORTAGUS.

9
00:00:20,613 --> 00:00:23,550
THIS IS ALL IN THE BACKDROP OF

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,450
THE KAVANAUGH SITUATION.

11
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,120
HE HAD A LITTLE FUN WITH DIANNE

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,754
FEINSTEIN.

13
00:00:27,754 --> 00:00:30,623
I DON'T KNOW IF THE AUDIENCE

14
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:32,192
TOTALLY REMEMBERS THIS.

15
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:35,028
BUT DIANE WAS ASKED ABOUT

16
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:36,763
LEAKING THE DR. FORD LETTER TO

17
00:00:36,763 --> 00:00:38,298
THE PRESS AND THE PRESIDENT HAD

18
00:00:38,298 --> 00:00:39,732
A LITTLE FUN WITH THAT.

19
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:41,935
LET'S ROLL THE TAPE AND REACT.

20
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:43,303
PRESIDENT TRUMP: WHEN YOU LOOK

21
00:00:43,303 --> 00:00:45,839
AT RELEASES AND LEAKS, THEN THEY

22
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:47,173
SAY I DIDN'T DO IT.

23
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:50,710
I DIDN'T DO IT.

24
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,578
REMEMBER, DIANNE FEINSTEIN.

25
00:00:51,578 --> 00:00:59,052
DID YOU LEAK?

26
00:00:59,052 --> 00:00:59,452
[CROWD BOOS]

27
00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:01,354
PRESIDENT TRUMP: REMEMBER HER

28
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:01,688
ANSWER?

29
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:04,623
DID YOU LEAK THE DOCUMENT?

30
00:01:04,623 --> 00:01:06,626
UH, UH, WHAT?

31
00:01:06,626 --> 00:01:08,028
NO.

32
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:08,929
UH, NO.

33
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:10,597
I DIDN'T LEAK.

34
00:01:10,597 --> 00:01:13,667
UH, WELL, WAIT, ONE MINUTE.

35
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:15,635
DID WE LEAK.

36
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:20,140
NO, NO, WE DIDN'T LEAK.

37
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,576
JESSE: IT'S FUNNY BUT IT'S NOT

38
00:01:22,576 --> 00:01:23,877
IF YOUY.

39
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:26,213
THIS IS A #metoo SITUATION.

40
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:28,515
THE IMPORTANCE OF RESPECTING THE

41
00:01:28,515 --> 00:01:31,385
ALLEGED ACCUSER, THE FEMALE IS

42
00:01:31,385 --> 00:01:33,720
CRITICAL TO MAINTAINING HER

43
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,822
INTEGRITY AND HER PEACE OF MIND.

44
00:01:35,822 --> 00:01:38,058
AND SHE DIDN'T WANT HER NAME OUT

45
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:40,494
THERE, YET DIANNE FEINSTEIN OR

46
00:01:40,494 --> 00:01:43,230
ONE OF HER COLLEAGUES OBVIOUSLY,

47
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,464
BECAUSE THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY OF

48
00:01:44,464 --> 00:01:46,533
THE LETTER WAS ESTABLISHED.

49
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,535
LEAKED HER NAME TO EVERYBODY,

50
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:50,837
AND THIS HOISTED THIS WOMAN WHO

51
00:01:50,837 --> 00:01:52,839
DIDN'T WANT TO GO PUBLIC INTO

52
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,174
THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT AND

53
00:01:54,174 --> 00:01:56,610
TORTURED HER IN FRONT AFTER LIVE

54
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,611
TV AUDIENCE.

55
00:01:57,611 --> 00:02:01,448
THAT WAS A PRETTY INTENSE ATTACK

56
00:02:01,448 --> 00:02:03,417
ON DIANNE.

57
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:04,518
THAT HANDED HARD.

58
00:02:04,518 --> 00:02:06,920
>> IT WAS WELL DESERVED.

59
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,990
IT WAS EITHER FEINSTEIN, THE

60
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,024
CONGRESSIONAL STAFF OR THE

61
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:11,992
LAWYERS.

62
00:02:11,992 --> 00:02:13,794
THEY DID A HUGE DISSERVICE TO

63
00:02:13,794 --> 00:02:14,695
HER.

64
00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:16,697
EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THIS

65
00:02:16,697 --> 00:02:18,332
FBI INVESTIGATION HOW IT NEED

66
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:19,967
MORE TIME NOW.

67
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:23,770
ALL OF THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED

68
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,405
WITH CONFIDENTIALITY UNDER A

69
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:27,541
PRESENT THIS WHICH THIS POOR

70
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,509
WOMAN DIDN'T HAVE TO BE PRAYED

71
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:30,744
IN FRONT OF MILLIONS AND

72
00:02:30,744 --> 00:02:32,346
BILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE

73
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:32,946
WORLD.

74
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:34,381
THE ATTACK WAS TROUGH.

75
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:38,052
BUT I THINK IT WAS DESERVED.

76
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:39,486
I'M SURPRISED THAT DURING THE

77
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:41,889
COMMITTEE HEARING FEINSTEIN

78
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:43,624
DIDN'T HAVE A BETTER RESPONSE.

79
00:02:43,624 --> 00:02:46,493
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED.

80
00:02:46,493 --> 00:02:48,829
JESSE: IT DIDN'T LOOK GOOD.

81
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,397
HE ALSO TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO

82
00:02:50,397 --> 00:02:54,668
GO AFTER A 2020 CONTENDER CORY

83
00:02:54,668 --> 00:02:57,304
BOOKER WHO REMEMBER HAD THIS BIG

84
00:02:57,304 --> 00:02:58,873
SPARTACUS MOMENT WHERE HE

85
00:02:58,873 --> 00:03:00,441
THUMPED HIMSELF ON THE CHEST AND

86
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:02,209
WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF.

87
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,545
THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT THAT.

88
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:06,146
LET'S LISTEN.

89
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:07,948
PRESIDENT TRUMP: HOW ABOUT CORY

90
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:08,382
BOOKER.

91
00:03:08,382 --> 00:03:13,754
DID YOU WATCH THE PERFORMANCE?

92
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:15,856
HE RAN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY INTO

93
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:16,390
THE GROUND.

94
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,726
AND NOW HE WANTS TO BE

95
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:20,861
PRESIDENT, RIGHT?

96
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:27,501
WHAT WAS THE MOMENT HE SAID HE

97
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:27,935
HAD?

98
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:29,804
I DON'T THINK SO.

99
00:03:29,804 --> 00:03:35,843
I THINK WE TAKE KIRK DOUGLAS IN

100
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:38,813
HIS PRIME.

101
00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:40,414
DR. GORKA, WHAT DID YOU THINK

102
00:03:40,414 --> 00:03:41,148
ABOUT THAT?

103
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:43,951
>> HE WAS ON FORM.

104
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:46,988
HE KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK.

105
00:03:46,988 --> 00:03:49,323
WHEN HE GETS OFF HIS

106
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:50,791
TELEPROMPTER IT'S AMAZING.

107
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,994
BUT TO THE SERIOUS SIDE OF THIS,

108
00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:54,662
THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THIS

109
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:55,196
THURSDAY.

110
00:03:55,196 --> 00:04:00,768
A MAN WHO HAS A SPOTLESS, WHITE,

111
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:04,105
COMPLETELY CLEAN RECORD FOR 50

112
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:08,643
YEARS, WITHIN 11 DAYS GOES TO

113
00:04:08,643 --> 00:04:11,178
BEING AN UPSTANDING GODLY MAN TO

114
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:13,147
BE ACCUSED OF POTENTIAL GANG

115
00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:18,418
RAPE AND ATTEMPTED MURDER.

116
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,055
AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PUT HIP

117
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:23,925
IN THE SPOTLIGHT ARE A WOMAN,

118
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:26,494
FEINSTEIN, WHO FOR 20 YEARS HAD

119
00:04:26,494 --> 00:04:28,563
A CHINESE SPY ON HER PAYROLL

120
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:30,798
WHEN SHE WAS ON THE INTELLIGENCE

121
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:33,001
COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE.

122
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:35,069
CORY BOOKER WHO ADMITTED ON THE

123
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:36,638
RECORD TO GROPING HIGH SCHOOL

124
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:37,639
TEENAGER.

125
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,877
AND A MAN CALLED DICK BLUMENTHAL

126
00:04:42,877 --> 00:04:45,079
WHO LECTURES THE FEDERAL JUDGE

127
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,648
ON LYING AND TELLING THE TRUTH

128
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:49,550
WHEN HE REPEATEDLY LIED ABOUT

129
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,753
BEING A COMBAT VETERAN IN

130
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:52,420
VIETNAM.

131
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,157
THIS IS POLITICS IN 2018 AND IT

132
00:04:56,157 --> 00:04:57,525
SHOULD DISGUST ALL AMERICANS.

133
00:04:57,525 --> 00:05:00,161
IF YOU LOOK AT SOCIAL MEDIA,

134
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:02,463
THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

135
00:05:02,463 --> 00:05:04,265
ANGRY WHO DIDN'T VOTE FOR TRUMP,

136
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:06,301
AND I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO

137
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:08,202
VOTE FOR TRUMP AND THE

138
00:05:08,202 --> 00:05:09,070
REPUBLICAN TICKET.

139
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,973
JESSE: THE WOMEN I HAVE SPOKEN

140
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:14,943
TO RECENTLY ARE REALLY AGHAST AT

141
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:16,177
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON.

142
00:05:16,177 --> 00:05:18,813
THEY CAN SEE IT CAN BE UNFAIR ON

143
00:05:18,813 --> 00:05:19,714
THE OTHER SIDE.

144
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:21,849
YOU HAVE SEEN HOAXES, AND I'M

145
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:25,353
NOT SAYING FORD IS A HOAX

146
00:05:25,353 --> 00:05:27,222
ARTIST, BUT BY THE WAY THE

147
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:29,424
POLITICAL MACHINE WORKED WHEN

148
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:31,826
FEINSTEIN TAPPED FORD'S LAWYER

149
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:35,330
AND SAID GO TO KATZ, THIS WOMAN

150
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,333
WHO IS A SOCIALIST, A MEMBER OF

151
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,534
THE RESISTANCE.

152
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:42,837
IT WAS TOO CO-INCIDENTAL, HERMAN

153
00:05:42,837 --> 00:05:43,638
CAIN.

154
00:05:43,638 --> 00:05:46,274
TO THINK A MAN WITH UP A STELLAR

155
00:05:46,274 --> 00:05:48,777
REP CASE CAN COME UP IN FRONT OF

156
00:05:48,777 --> 00:05:51,246
PEOPLE WITH LESS THAN STELLAR

157
00:05:51,246 --> 00:05:52,680
REPUTATIONS AND HAVE HIS

158
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,716
INTEGRITY QUESTIONS LIKE THAT.

159
00:05:54,716 --> 00:05:56,518
OBVIOUSLY HE'S INCREDIBLY ANGRY

160
00:05:56,518 --> 00:05:58,720
AND UPSET AND IMPASSIONED.

161
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,490
NOW THE LEFT IS SAYING HE'S TOO

162
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,692
UPSET AND ANGRY AND IMPASSIONED

163
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:06,561
TO BE A BALANCED AND IMPARTIAL

164
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:08,430
JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT.

165
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,398
THEY WERE NEVER GOING TO VOTE

166
00:06:10,398 --> 00:06:12,934
FOR HIM, AND THIS IS ALL A BIG

167
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:13,502
STUNT.

168
00:06:13,502 --> 00:06:16,538
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

169
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:18,073
>> I AGREE WITH YOU.

170
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:20,809
AS WE WOULD SAY IN THE BAPTIST

171
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:23,912
CHURCH TO DR. GORKA'S ASK

172
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:25,147
COMMENT AND THE OTHER COMMENTS

173
00:06:25,147 --> 00:06:27,382
ABOUT THE LAID YESTERDAY, AMEN,

174
00:06:27,382 --> 00:06:28,150
AMEN, AMEN.

175
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,087
NUMBER ONE.

176
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:39,061
NUMBER TWO -- I JUST WANTED THEM

177
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:41,063
TO KNOW HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE

178
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:42,798
THEIR COMMENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE

179
00:06:42,798 --> 00:06:44,566
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON.

180
00:06:44,566 --> 00:06:49,137
NOW, THEY HAVE TAKEN JUDGE

181
00:06:49,137 --> 00:06:51,940
KAVANAUGH AND TRIED TO DO WHAT

182
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,310
THEY CALL POLITICAL CHARACTER

183
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,913
ASSASSINATION AND AS DR. GORKA

184
00:06:57,913 --> 00:06:59,481
SAID, I BELIEVE IT MANY

185
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:00,015
BACKFIRING.

186
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:01,950
I HEAR FROM PEOPLE ALL THE TIME.

187
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,818
I SEE PEOPLE.

188
00:07:02,818 --> 00:07:04,686
