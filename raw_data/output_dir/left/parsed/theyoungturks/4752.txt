I WAS GENUINELY SURPRISED
WHEN DONALD TRUMP COMPLETED YET
ANOTHER ARMS DEAL OVER THE
WEEKEND WHEN I SAW WHO IT WAS HE
WAS SELLING THE ARMS TO.
IT'S
OVER $20 BILLION, OF WHICH 12
BILLION IS FINALIZED, GOING TO
QATAR, COUNTRY HE HAS RECENTLY
SPOKEN ABOUT, AND NOT IN THE I
AM ABOUT TO SELL YOU TONS OF
JETS SORT OF WAY.
HE TWEETED
THIS AFTER HISTORY TO THE MIDDLE
EAST --
>>AND THE BEGINNING OF
SOMETHING NEW, LIKE CASH MONEY
THAT WE WILL GET FOR SELLING
THEM JETS.
SO YEAH --
>>THIS WAS FINALIZED AT THE END
OF LAST YEAR UNDER BARACK OBAMA,
WHO DIDN'T CHASTISE THEM ON
TWITTER OF BEING FUNDERS OF
RADICAL TERRORISM, BUT THE
ENTIRE THING DOESN'T MAKE A LOT
OF SENSE BECAUSE TRUMP GOES
THERE, AND IMMEDIATELY
AFTERWARDS IS ATTACKING THEM,
AND THERE'S THIS BIG BLOCKADE,
DIPLOMATIC AND OTHERWISE OF THE
STATES IN THE REGION, HE'S
ATTACKING THEM.
ON THE TRIP HE
SAID HE WOULD SELL QATAR BIG,
BEAUTIFUL WEAPONS, THAT'S BEFORE
THE INSULTS, WHICH IS BEFORE THE
WEAPONS SALES.
DOES HE KNOW WHAT
COUNTRY HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ANY
OF THOSE INSTANCES?
>>AND THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO
QATAR STEPPED DOWN LAST WEEK
AFTER TWEETING NEGATIVELY ABOUT
TRUMP, AND THE WHOLE NOTION THAT
THINGS ARE FALLING APART FOR
AMERICA IN QATAR IS AMAZING NOW,
BECAUSE WHAT DOES HE DO AFTER
ALL THE CRITICISM?
WELL, LET'S
GO SELL THEM SOME ARMS.
>>I HAVE A THEORY, IT'S EASY FOR
A LEFTY LIKE ME TO LOOK AT THIS
AND SAY HE'S BEING INCONSISTENT,
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THIS IS
NOT SOME WEIRD SLIP, IT'S A
DIABOLICAL MASTER PLAN.
BECAUSE
HE SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT THEY
ARE FUNDERS OF TERRORISM.
WHAT
CAN THEY NOT DO IF YOU GET 12
BILLION OF THEIR DOLLARS?
THEY
CAN'T GIVE IT TO TERRORISTS.
>>BUT THEY ALSO CLOSED AL
JAZEERA AMERICA, SO THEY HAVE
ALL THAT MONEY TO PLAY WITH TOO.
THAT DIDN'T FIGURE INTO THE
WHOLE THING.
>>THAT MONEY SHOULD HAVE GONE TO
YOU INSTEAD OF RADICAL
TERRORISM.
