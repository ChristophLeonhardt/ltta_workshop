6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,559
the Washington Post reported that Trump

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,870
DC hotel officials had done outreach to

8
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,700
local foreign embassies Trump met with

9
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,260
Indian businessmen who work with his

10
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,180
brand Ivanka Trump took part in a state

17
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,920
told the New York Times that he'd be

18
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,779
capable of running his president along

19
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,430
his business alongside his presidency

20
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,950
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was kind of disquieting but</font>

21
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,750
Trump actually understands the problem

22
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,370
now he tweeted this morning quote I will

23
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,780
be holding<font color="#E5E5E5"> a major news conference in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">December 15th to discuss the fact that I</font>

26
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,399
will be leaving my great business in

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,530
total in order to fully focus on running

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,629
the country in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all caps make</font>

29

America great again while i am not

mandated to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> under the law but</font>

31
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:53,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">feel that is visually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important as</font>

32

33
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,789
of interest with my various businesses

34
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,890
hence legal documents are being crafted

35
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,300
which take me completely out of business

36
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,430
operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> the presidency is a far more</font>

37
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,680
important task so here's the deal this

38
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,090
isn't enough we still<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

39
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,740
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> how these legal documents will</font>

40
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,240
shape up is Trump giving up his

41
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,010
ownership stake there's no indicator he

42
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,780
is well his children continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run the</font>

43
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,580
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yet continue to also advise</font>

44
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,290
him in his role<font color="#E5E5E5"> as president that would</font>

45
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,820
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain the conflict will</font>

46
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,740
trump liquidate his businesses really

47
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,240
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> unlikely in a joint statement</font>

48
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,909

52
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,790
sometimes conflict with the public

53
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">interest and constantly raise questions</font>

54
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,320
but but at least Trump recognizes the

55
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,420
problem that's at least half the battle

56
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,100
we can actually hope that he'll be

57
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,810
cautious enough to silo his businesses

58
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,520
and political interests preventing the

59
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,680
taint of his scandal from destroying his

60
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">White House before it launches good for</font>

61
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,369
Trump now let's pray that he carries out

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,020
his pledge I'm Ben Shapiro this is the

big news of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day yesterday was that</font>

122
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,780
mittens Mitt Romney met with Donald

<font color="#E5E5E5">Trump and I do love how this went down</font>

124
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,150
so basically they met and here's a

125
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,120
picture of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> well first of all I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

126
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,890
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the stage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here's what Mitt</font>

127
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,359
Romney said about Donald Trump during

128
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:04,400
the campaign if you recall

129
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,250
if we make improvident choices the

130
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,129
bright horizon I've described will not

131
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:12,470
materialize and let me put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it very</font>

132
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,590
plainly if we Republicans choose Donald

133
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,440
Trump as our nominee the prospect for a

134
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,168
safe and prosperous future are greatly

135
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:23,720
diminished if Donald Trump's plans were

136
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,660
ever implemented the country would sink

137
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,169
into prolonged recession a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> examples</font>

138
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,830
his proposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> 35-percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tariff like</font>

139
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,229
penalties would instigate a trade war

140
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:38,570
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would raise prices for</font>

141
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,110
consumers kill our export jobs and lead

142
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">auto phony to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right he says that Trump</font>

143
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a phony is a con man he's a liar</font>

144
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,080
basically this is a pretty brutal speech

145
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,789
if your call<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in march during the</font>

146
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,400
primaries and and so you know bottom

147
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,600
line is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> romney was not very</font>

148
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">friendly to trump and now they get</font>

149
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,510
together for dinner and here's the

150
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:00,139

amazing it is also worth noting by the

212
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,919
way that remember when Donald Trump

213
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:14,479

234
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,620
corrupt bargains happening among the

00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,690
people who are eating frog legs although

236
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,479

and Pepe was with Trump the entire way

00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then Trump just ate him and</font>

240
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:10,430
somewhere the alt right cries and tears

241
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,160
of sorrow rolled down Pepe's cheeks it

242
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,910
is all very very tragic then Mitt Romney

243
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,169
came out afterward and he made this

244
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:20,539
statement after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dinner and he just</font>

245

looks I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean Trump and his people had</font>

246
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,140
asked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically an apology from Mitt</font>

247
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,670
Romney and Romney

248
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,560
clearly wants the gig and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so now he's</font>

249
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:35,860
apologizing pretty amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> engages</font>

250
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">enjoying the very much I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also very</font>

251
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">impressed by the remarks he made on his</font>

252
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:45,140
victory<font color="#CCCCCC"> knife by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it's not easy</font>

253
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,470
when I know that myself he did something

254
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">I try to do and was unsuccessfully he'd</font>

255
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">want the generalist and and he continues</font>

256
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a message</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of inclusion bringing</font>

257
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,230
people together and his<font color="#E5E5E5"> vision is</font>

258
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,610
something which obviously connected with

259
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,900
the American<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in a very powerful</font>

260
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,150
way wings joke right it's a joke I mean

261
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,680
Romney's is looking for an excuse to

262
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,750
jump back on the Trump train here and

263
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,420
he's finding it in you know his his

264
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,090
speech and his cabinet<font color="#E5E5E5"> Romney still</font>

265
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,380
thinks went from exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what Romney</font>

266
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,400
always thought of Trump there are two

267
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,050
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read Romney's behavior here one</font>

268
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,790
is Romney really really really really

269
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,470
wants back into power that's the cynical

270
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,760
way to read this the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other way to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font>

271
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,260
this is that Romney believes and things

272
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,350
that Trump could use some stayed steady

273
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,240
sober judgment around him and so he's

274
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,800
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to undergo the humiliation of</font>

275
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,170
dealing with Trump and maybe being

276
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,850
thrown under<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bus by Trump in order</font>

277
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it and again Trump hasn't selected</font>

278
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">him yet for Secretary of State so this</font>

279
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,250
could all go wildly wrong right there

280
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">only two possible ways this plays out as</font>

281
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,810
far as as far as Romney is concerned in

282
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,880
terms of public image these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> both</font>

283
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,400
from Game of Thrones the way number<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

284
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,690
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out for Romney just in terms</font>

285
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,090
of how this plays out politically is is

286
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this right here what is to be</font>

287
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,650
done with this traitor your grace so

288
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,230
long as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am your king treason shall</font>

289
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,760
never go unpunished

290
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,250
like that that's that's that's possible

291
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,320
that he goes out he makes his obese

292
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">institute rump and then Trump a heads</font>

293
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,710
him and picks rudy<font color="#CCCCCC"> giuliani which would</font>

294
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,970
be hilarious i will say it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

295
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,650
really really funny the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other way that</font>

296
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">this could go is is that Trump actually</font>

297
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,340
gives him what he wants but that

298
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,020
involves him being a little bit

299
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:30,710
humiliated go on me nice clothes

300
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,850
hey I could go reek ready could be read

301
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,160
in reality the truth is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

302
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,780
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> is overplayed Trump likes to play</font>

303
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,480
reality TV it is reality TV it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

304
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,310
entertaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will admit that and I</font>

305
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">have all of my Bachelorette outtakes for</font>

306
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,970
when he actually makes this call because

307
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,410
the Bachelorette outtakes will fit

308
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">Giuliani or Romney one of the two will</font>

309
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,250
be sobbing in a car about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how they were</font>

310
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,870
so deeply in love and then they were

311
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,630
left<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the altar but in reality is that</font>

312
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,070
is Trump playing this right Trump is

313
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,030
playing this about as well as he could

314
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,020
have played this really i mean he's

315
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,060
making Romney look foolish he's making

316
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,380
Romney look like he has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bend the knee</font>

317
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,510
to him and then if he actually picks

318
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,220
Romney it's a brilliant move politically

319
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,600
because it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

320
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,460
his own pettiness about Romney in order

321
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,990
to stock his cabinet with people who are

322
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,910
good and if he<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't pick Romney well</font>

323
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,140
then he's done<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a lot of people</font>

324
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,390
expected him to do on his own side you

325
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,770
know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> his own base and he stomped</font>

326
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,480
Romney in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the face and and he's going to</font>

327
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,560
get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of credit for that from his</font>

328
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,960
own base<font color="#E5E5E5"> so he's in a no-lose situation</font>

329
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,910
I'm Romney played along i assume out of

330
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,890
patriotism and a sense of duty but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

331
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,300
could have also been out of ego both are

332
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,570
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it is fascinating to watch</font>

333
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,800
this sort of stuff typically is not done

334
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,360
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the cameras and yet Trump is</font>

335
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,560
doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all in front of the cameras</font>

336
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,640
which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a very very</font>

337
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,670
entertaining very entertaining for years

338
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,490
you mean while Trump is being given a

339
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,790
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of credit for this for carrier</font>

340
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,770
keeping a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of jobs a carrier is an</font>

341
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,080
air conditioner manufacturer and they

342
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,310
just they just announced they're going

343
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,770
to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> a thousand jobs in Indiana and I</font>

344
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,850
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

345
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">serious way because I think that a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

346
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,020
of people are ignoring the real story

347
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,680
here and that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so a lot of</font>

348
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,940
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are immediately celebrating the</font>

349
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,440
fact that Trump kept jobs in America

350
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,910
that's great okay that's that's that's

351
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,860
wonderful except for that's not the

352
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,200
actual story lots of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use the</font>

353
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,790
government to keep jobs in a particular

354
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,680
place Barack<font color="#CCCCCC"> Obama used the power of</font>

355
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,450
government the threat of the pitchforks

356
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,940
and torches to leverage the banks to do

357
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,800
things that he wanted Barack<font color="#CCCCCC"> Obama was</font>

358
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,690
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the auto companies come on</font>

359
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,700
bended knee to him in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that he</font>

360
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,140
could get them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do what he wanted by</font>

361
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,880
threatening them the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> line here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

362
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,860
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thousand job saved the bottom</font>

363
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,060
line is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we still don't know which</font>

364
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,950
is what did Trump do to get carrier to

365
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,110
keep its jobs there so a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

366
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">are saying we shouldn't even ask the</font>

367
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,360
question we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should just sort of accept</font>

368
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,250
what it is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should just sort of take</font>

369
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,400
it how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no big problem no big issue</font>

370
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,160
you know

371
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,839
at least he kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> the jobs here that in</font>

372
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,899
and of itself is wonderful and that

373
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:58,310
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay except for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that</font>

374
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,410
how you use the government is really the

375
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,569
issue for me not<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily the outcome</font>

376
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:04,129
you can always keep a company here

377
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:05,180
listen if I were in charge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

378
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,740
federal<font color="#CCCCCC"> government pick a company in</font>

379
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,940
America I could keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> here just by</font>

380
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,470
paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> them a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I could bribe</font>

381
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,209
a company to stay here<font color="#CCCCCC"> or alternatively</font>

382
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,399
I could threaten<font color="#E5E5E5"> that company in order</font>

383
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,750
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make them stay here right the power</font>

384
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,550
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the presidency is vast the power of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the federal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> government is vast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

386
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,480
question is what did Trump do in order

387
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,160
to ensure the carrier would stay so

388
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,509
here's what we know we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

389
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:25,579
anything really because Trump has not

390
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:27,350
announced what the deal was Mike Pence's

391
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,759
the governor<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Indiana he's the one</font>

392
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,139
really offering the incentives<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

393
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:31,910
he's still governor of Indiana carrier

394
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,129
is located in Indiana so we still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

395
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:35,899
to figure out exactly what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pence offered</font>

396
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,550
and this does make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a difference here's</font>

397
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,350
what we know or at least the<font color="#E5E5E5"> little that</font>

398
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,850
we do know according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the New York</font>

399
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">Times united technologies which is the</font>

400
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:44,720
owner of carrier is among the country's

401
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,120
biggest military contractors producing

402
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,860
engines for the Pentagon's most<font color="#CCCCCC"> advanced</font>

403
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,420
fighter jets receiving more than 5

404
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,829
billion dollars annually from the

405
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:53,269
federal government<font color="#E5E5E5"> that equals ten</font>

406
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:55,310
percent of the company's revenue so

407
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,350
there's the idea that perhaps Trump said

408
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,000
we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the Defense Department cut</font>

409
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,529
our contracts to you if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> move those</font>

410
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,019
jobs<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's bad that's bad that's</font>

411
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:05,509
the cut that's the government leveraging

412
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:07,430
businesses into making bad business

413
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,680
decisions through threat right not

414
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,550
getting the best deal for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the American</font>

415
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,170
people because presumably the reason

416
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're contracting with United</font>

417
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,990
Technologies is because united

418
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,310
technologies provides the best service

419
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,630
at the best price here's what we know

420

courtesy of CNBC quote while terms of

421
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,680
the deal are not yet clear the sources

422
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,329

for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> agreement well while United</font>

426

427
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:31,699
would come<font color="#CCCCCC"> from moving some production</font>

428
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:33,470
to Mexico people familiar with the

<font color="#E5E5E5">situation indicated the savings were not</font>

430
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,949
worth incurring the wrath of the

431
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:38,930
incoming administration including the

432
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,670
potential threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the significant</font>

433
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,439
business united technologies currently

434

conducts with the US government largely

435
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,009
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the form of orders for jet engines</font>

436
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:47,899
and other defense related equipment so

437
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:49,309
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the federal government leveraging</font>

438
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:51,230
people now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like the federal</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">government is a Republican or a Democrat</font>

442
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,050
that is not the job of the federal

and if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has contracts that it needs to</font>

446
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,380
do then it should contract the best

<font color="#E5E5E5">available operator not the operator</font>

448
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,630
that makes bad financial decisions in

<font color="#E5E5E5">order to please the federal government</font>

450
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,360
right that's a backdoor form of bribery

451
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,000
from united technologies and by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

452

<font color="#E5E5E5">this also sets up a pretty bad precedent</font>

453
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,270
a company says we're gonna move 2,000

454
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,860
jobs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mexico and then they wait for</font>

455
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,480
Trump to come in with a noodle of cash

456
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,790
and just dump it on them okay this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

457
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">not that this is not particularly a rip</font>

458
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,750
on trumpets it's a rip on the policies

00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,670
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a look Trump</font>

made a promise and Trump is trying to

461
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,790
keep that<font color="#E5E5E5"> promise but the way you keep</font>

462
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,380
the promise matters to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the principal</font>

463
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,210
doesn't change just because the name of

464
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,370
the guy in power changes and I

465
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,300
understand everybody's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

466
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">celebrate the thousand jobs but these</font>

467
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,320
kinds of headlines routinely routinely

468
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,970
come out from administration's ranging

469
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,830
from Barack Obama's to Hugo Chavez is

470
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,840
the question isn't whether carrier keeps

471
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,120
the thousand jobs in Indiana<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

472
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,590
question is why they kept a thousand

473
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,840
jobs in Indiana if carrier kept the

474
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,390
thousand jobs in Indiana if they kept

475
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the thousand jobs in Indiana because</font>

476
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,900
Donald Trump was pursuing positive

477
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,000
economic policies that benefit everyone

478
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,340
and they say in expectation of lower

479
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,100
taxes and an expectation of loosened

480
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,380
regulations we've decided that we're

481
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,330
going to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> the jobs here wonderful</font>

482
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,190
all credit to trump if they say we're

483
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,270
keeping the thousand jobs here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

484
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,980
Donald Trump bribed us or because Donald

485
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,300
from threatened us that's not something

486
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,250
that I'm cool with and<font color="#CCCCCC"> as conservative</font>

487
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,630
you shouldn't be cool with that either

488
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that's just using government to</font>

489
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,710
pick winners and losers and as I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> fond</font>

490
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,790
of saying I'm old enough to remember

491

<font color="#E5E5E5">when we thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was bad when Obama</font>

492
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,880
did with green jobs and stimulus

495
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,120
the threat of pitchforks and torches he

496
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,250
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> said he brought bankers to the</font>

is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only thing between you and the</font>

500
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,850
pitchforks and then he leveraged them

501
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,020
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing what he wanted he did the</font>

502

<font color="#E5E5E5">same thing to the health insurance</font>

503

that was bad it wouldn't be any<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

507
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,190
if Trump did it hey who go Chavez used

508
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,690
to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hugo Chavez actually had a</font>

509
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,700
show the Venezuelan socialist dictator

510
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,590
he actually had to show in Venezuela

511
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,660
when it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> called hello president that</font>

512
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,370
was the name of the show it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a full</font>

513
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,260
day show he literally go on camera at

514
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,270
like eight in the morning on Sundays all

515
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,740
the way to like six in the evenings<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

516
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">the producer of the show would explain</font>

517
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,369
this way said the president decides

518
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:14,050
everything it's his show it was called

519
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,640
hello president because people would

520
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,500
call in but it became like<font color="#CCCCCC"> lottery</font>

521
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,910
everyone looking to get a job

522
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,680
a house or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something Chavez would</font>

523
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,240
literally give jobs to people on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> air</font>

524
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,230
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in so I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

525
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">job Chavez would say I'll give you a job</font>

526
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,790
look at my magnificence the only way he

527
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,410
could give a job of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> was to take a</font>

528
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,300
job away from somebody else or to take

529
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,520
money away from somebody else now this

530
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,680
is this is the definition of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> swamp</font>

531
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,970
okay when<font color="#CCCCCC"> people talk about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> swamp</font>

532
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,950
needs to be drained and crony capitalism

533
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,080
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> definition of it and it</font>

534
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,340
doesn't become good just because our

535
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,440
guys are doing it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we get too</font>

536
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,910
excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the carrier decides to</font>

537
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,680
keep a thousand jobs in the United

538
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,570
States headline let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out how it</font>

539
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,120
was done if the headline said

540
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,230
cylindrical you now<font color="#E5E5E5"> Obama promises we'd</font>

541
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,160
all be saying wait a second that's

542
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,440
bribery you can't do that again

543
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,880
consistency in principle I know people

544
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">get upset with consistency in principle</font>

545
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,780
I know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> get very upset with the</font>

546
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,040
idea that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold everybody</font>

547
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,510
to the same standard or they were going

548
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to mandate the Donald Trump actually act</font>

549
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,830
in accordance with conservatism but the

550
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,300
fact is that if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't hold him</font>

551
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">accountable for his sins then who are we</font>

552
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,660
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hold them accountable to like</font>

553
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,160
who's going to be accountable the way

554
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,630
the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> president's accountable is</font>

555
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,250
making them accountable for their

556
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,530
behavior so I hope that Trump reveals

557
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,030
his plan and his plan is get<font color="#CCCCCC"> rid of</font>

558
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,590
regulations get rid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> taxation lower</font>

559
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,820
the corporate tax rate that's why

560
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,770
carrier kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> the jobs if that happens I</font>

561
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,390
will celebrate louder and longer than

562
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,160
anyone because that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be excellent</font>

563
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,230
Trump not good Trump excellent Trump but

564
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,460
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was just another crony</font>

565
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">capitalist</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> payoff to carrier so that he</font>

566
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,760
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have his headline in his moment in</font>

567
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,810
the Sun where he said that he kept

568
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,850
carrier there with its thousand jobs as

569
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,230
a bunch of crap<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's crap whether a</font>

570
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,760
Democrat doesn't and it's crap whether

571
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,410
there's a Republican<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

572
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,330
this these things do not change just

573
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,860
because the name at the top of the

574
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,420
ticket changes the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the White</font>

575
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,980
House changes the minute you sacrifice

576
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">principle for political convenience the</font>

577
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,390
principal no longer matters it no longer

578
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,340
matters so before you celebrate

579
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,170
headlines let's look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual</font>

580
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,750
content<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the story right for example</font>

581
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,860
i'm willing to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump the benefit of</font>

582
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> doubt right now on is he going to</font>

583
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">separate from his business he's gonna</font>

584
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,750
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fill that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out with content if</font>

585
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,820
the content is my kids will run the

586
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,410
business and they'll also<font color="#E5E5E5"> advise me in</font>

587
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,150
the White House the conflict still

588
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,340
exists if he separates off and his kids

589
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,900
run<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business and they have nothing</font>

590
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do at the White House good for him</font>

591
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,660
I'll be cheering because I want his

592
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,700
presidency to be a success I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> him to</font>

593
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,230
govern like Ronald Reagan I would love

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it I would love to be wrong about</font>

595
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,580
him I would but we have to call out bad

596
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,170
things when we see them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't</font>

00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,340
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably because he and Trump</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> State because he and Trump disagree</font>

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,530
on foreign policy and they do right

campaign they really disagree on this

632
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,150
stuff the only real criticism has been

633
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Romney rip Trump during the</font>

634

primaries but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in any case the I guess it</font>

big names of the people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are left</font>

639
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,630
