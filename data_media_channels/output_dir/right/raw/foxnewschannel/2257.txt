1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,326
ARE GETTING.

2
00:00:02,326 --> 00:00:04,861
NOT RAPISTS.

3
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:07,264
>> Martha: WE DON'T KNOW THAT,

4
00:00:07,264 --> 00:00:07,631
OF COURSE.

5
00:00:07,631 --> 00:00:08,064
>> WE DO!

6
00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:10,100
>> Martha: WE DON'T!

7
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,200
JORGE

8
00:00:13,804 --> 00:00:14,805
>> Tucker: HAS NOT BEEN FORCED

9
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,273
TO REGISTER AS A FOREIGN AGENT.

10
00:00:16,273 --> 00:00:21,178
HE ALSO WROTE THE BOOK,

11
00:00:21,178 --> 00:00:21,878
"STRANGER," THE CHALLENGE OF

12
00:00:21,878 --> 00:00:25,515
BEING LATINO IN THE TRUNK ERA.

13
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:27,718
JORGE, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

14
00:00:27,718 --> 00:00:28,585
THE FIRST       FIRST AND THE MS

15
00:00:28,585 --> 00:00:28,618
THE FIRST       FIRST AND THE MT

16
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:28,652
THE FIRST       FIRST AND THE MI

17
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:28,685
THE FIRST       FIRST AND THE MP

18
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:28,719
THE FIRST       FIRST AND THE MR

19
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:28,752
THE FIRST       FIRST AND THE MA

20
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:29,753
THE FIRST       FIRST AND THE MT

21
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:31,488
QUESTION IS WHY SHOULD WE LET

22
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,488
THESE ASYLUM-SEEKERS, THESE

23
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,193
MIGRANTS INTO THE COUNTRY?

24
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:37,661
>> I THINK THE UNITED STATES IS

25
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:38,628
BEING HIGH

26
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,099
HOSTILE AND EVEN

27
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:44,701
AGGRESSIVE COUNTRY AGAINST

28
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:45,302
REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS.

29
00:00:45,302 --> 00:00:48,572
WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF BEING

30
00:00:48,572 --> 00:00:49,373
ACCEPTING OF IMMIGRANTS FROM

31
00:00:49,373 --> 00:00:51,074
COUNTRIES WHERE THEY ARE FLEEING

32
00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:52,976
VIOLENCE AND POVERTY AND LACK OF

33
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:54,177
DEMOCRACY.

34
00:00:54,177 --> 00:00:55,011
I THINK THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT

35
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,780
THE UNITED STATES IS.

36
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,181
AT THE END, TUCKER, I THINK IT'S

37
00:00:58,181 --> 00:00:59,049
A MATTER OF DECIDING WHAT KIND

38
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:01,118
OF COUNTRY DO WE WANT TO BE.

39
00:01:01,118 --> 00:01:02,819
IT SEEMS AT THIS POINT THAT WE

40
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:06,523
ARE TALKING ABOUT A FEW HUNDRED

41
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:08,825
REFUGEES AND PUTTING IT IN

42
00:01:08,825 --> 00:01:10,560
CONTEXT FROM THE 65 MILLION

43
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,462
REFUGEES THAT ARE AROUND THE

44
00:01:12,462 --> 00:01:12,763
WORLD.

45
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:13,930
THE UNITED STATES EXCEPT AND

46
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,166
ONLY 84,000 IN 2016 AND THIS IS

47
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,802
GOING TO BE EVEN LESS.

48
00:01:18,802 --> 00:01:20,203
IT'S A MATTER OF DECIDING WHAT

49
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:21,405
KIND OF COUNTRY DO WE WANT TO

50
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:21,805
BE.

51
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:23,974
>> Tucker: WE'VE ACCEPTED

52
00:01:23,974 --> 00:01:25,976
ABOUT 13 MILLION REFUGEES,

53
00:01:25,976 --> 00:01:26,743
ECONOMIC REFUGEES IN OUR COUNTRY

54
00:01:26,743 --> 00:01:28,345
NOW ILLEGALLY.

55
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:30,380
BUT BACKUP FOR ONE SECOND.

56
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,115
YOU SAID THIS IS A HOSTILE,

57
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:34,184
DANGEROUS PLACE FOR REFUGEES?

58
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:35,886
WHY WOULD YOU WANT THEM TO COME

59
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:36,887
HERE IF UNITED STATES IS SO

60
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:38,622
DANGEROUS?

61
00:01:38,622 --> 00:01:40,290
>> THAT IS MUCH, MUCH BETTER

62
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,960
THAN IF YOU ARE A FATHER IN

63
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,797
SAN PEDRO SULA AND YOU HAVE A

64
00:01:46,797 --> 00:01:47,964
SUDDEN, THE SON WANTS TO BE

65
00:01:47,964 --> 00:01:50,167
RECRUITED BY THE GANGS.

66
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:51,802
OR IF THEY WANT TO THREATEN YOUR

67
00:01:51,802 --> 00:01:54,604
ONLY DAUGHTER, THEY WANT TO RAPE

68
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:56,773
HER, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

69
00:01:56,773 --> 00:01:57,874
MAY BE THE ONLY OPTION IS TO

70
00:01:57,874 --> 00:01:58,875
COME TO THE UNITED STATES --

71
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,577
B1 IT'S NOT THE     >> Tucker:

72
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:04,047
I'M NOT THE CITIZEN OF ANY OTHER

73
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:04,781
COUNTRY.

74
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:05,382
I PLAN TO STAY.

75
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:07,217
YOU DON'T NEED TO CONVINCE ME

76
00:02:07,217 --> 00:02:07,851
WHY PEOPLE WANT TO COME.

77
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:09,786
I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WOULD.

78
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:11,588
BUT IN ORDER TO GET HERE, THEY

79
00:02:11,588 --> 00:02:13,023
PASSED THROUGH MEXICO, WHICH IS

80
00:02:13,023 --> 00:02:16,159
BY MANY MEASURES A RICH COUNTRY.

81
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:16,927
THE 15TH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

82
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:17,227
WORLD.

83
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:20,564
THERE ARE 30 MEXICAN -- IT'S GOT

84
00:02:20,564 --> 00:02:21,965
A BIGGER ECONOMY THAN

85
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:22,399
SAUDI ARABIA.

86
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,467
THEY ARE PEOPLE SLEEPING IN THE

87
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:25,902
SLEEP IN TIJUANA.

88
00:02:26,036 --> 00:02:26,603
GOVERNMENT HELP THEM?

89
00:02:26,603 --> 00:02:27,971
>> FIRST OF THEM, THEY DO NOT

90
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:29,406
WANT TO STAY IN MEXICO.

91
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:30,207
THEY WANT TO COME TO THE

92
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:31,575
UNITED STATES FEARED SECOND OF

93
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:32,742
ALL, IF YOU ARE FLEEING

94
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:34,044
VIOLENCE, IF YOU ARE FLEEING

95
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:35,979
GANGS FROM HONDURAS AND

96
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:36,980
EL SALVADOR, WHY WOULD YOU WANT

97
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,348
TO GO TO MEXICO WHEN IN THE LAST

98
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:40,584
FIVE YEARS MORE THAN 100,000

99
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:42,752
PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY DRUG

100
00:02:42,752 --> 00:02:43,119
VIOLENCE?

101
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:45,021
WOULD YOU STAY IN MEXICO?

102
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:45,489
OF COURSE NOT.

103
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:49,192
>> Tucker: NO!

104
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:50,594
I ACTUALLY PROBABLY WANT TO FLY

105
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:51,461
BUSINESS CLASS TO ZURICH AND FLY

106
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:53,196
TO THE ALPS.

107
00:02:53,196 --> 00:02:53,930
I DON'T GET TO BECAUSE IT'S NOT

108
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,065
MY COUNTRY.

109
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:59,569
>> SO YOU WANT TO CLOSE THE

110
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:00,003
UNITED STATES?

111
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:00,704
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

112
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:01,805
>> Tucker: YES.

113
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:05,709
I WANT TO REVERT TO WHAT WE WERE

114
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,477
NUMBER WHICH IS A COUNTRY OF

115
00:03:07,477 --> 00:03:09,846
LAWS WHERE PEOPLE CAN COME HERE

116
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:10,981
BUT THEY DO SO LEGALLY.

117
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:11,915
WE HAVE OVER A MILLION PEOPLE

118
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:14,217
COME HERE EVERY YEAR LEGALLY.

119
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:15,785
THEY FILL OUT THE PAPERWORK,

120
00:03:15,785 --> 00:03:16,887
THEY GET IN LINE FROM AROUND THE

121
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:17,187
WORLD.

122
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:17,888
I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT SYSTEM

123
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,789
DOESN'T WORK.

124
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:21,491
>> THEN THEY WANT TO COME HERE

125
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:21,858
ILLEGALLY.

126
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:23,560
THEY WANT TO COME HERE LEGALLY

127
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,761
THROUGH THE WAY IN TIJUANA, FOR

128
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:25,829
TURQUOISE DAYS, THEY HAVE NOT

129
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,564
BEEN ALLOWED TO TALK TO AN

130
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:27,864
AGENT.

131
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:28,565
>> Tucker: THEY ARE TRYING TO

132
00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:30,600
BE HERE LEGALLY.

133
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,135
THEY ARE TRYING TO COME HERE AND

134
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:33,603
CLAIM ASYLUM WHICH IN EFFECT

135
00:03:33,603 --> 00:03:36,573
MEANS A COURT DATE WILL BE SET

136
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:37,274
AND THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY

137
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:38,008
WILL NOT SHOW UP FOR COURT AND

138
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:41,144
THEY WILL BLEND IN WITH THE

139
00:03:41,144 --> 00:03:41,778
OTHER 13 MILLION --

140
00:03:41,778 --> 00:03:44,581
>> I MEAN, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

141
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:45,982
THEY ARE FLEEING VIOLENCE, THEY

142
00:03:45,982 --> 00:03:46,683
ARE FLEEING GANGS --

143
00:03:46,683 --> 00:03:48,451
B1 HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

144
00:03:48,451 --> 00:03:48,919
WHAT DO YOU

145
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:52,389
>> Tucker: HOW DO YOU KNOW

146
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:52,689
THAT?

147
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:54,124
>> WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE.

148
00:03:54,124 --> 00:03:56,393
>> Tucker: WHO THEY ARE?

149
00:03:56,393 --> 00:03:57,627
>> WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THEM FOR

150
00:03:57,627 --> 00:03:57,961
25 DAYS.

151
00:03:57,961 --> 00:03:59,763
WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE.

152
00:03:59,763 --> 00:04:01,231
THAT'S WHY WE KNOW THEY ARE NOT

153
00:04:01,231 --> 00:00:00,000
CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS AND
