REGULATION. 
WE PASSED A BILL THROUGH THIS 
COMMITTEE LAST CONGRESS DEALING 
WITH DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION, 
NOT SO MUCH FOR FACEBOOK BUT 
CREDIT CARD BREACHES. 
A GOOD BILL. 
MANY OF THE FRIENDS ON THE 
OTHER SIDE VOTED AGAINST IT. 
I THINK IT'S ONE THAT WE SHOULD 
CONSIDER AGAIN IN LIGHT OF WHAT 
IS GOING ON HERE. 
YOU SIGNED A CONSENT DEGREE IN 
2011. 
WHEN I READ THROUGH THE 
CONSENT, IT'S EXPLICIT. 
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT FINE OF 
$40,000 PER VIOLATION PER DAY. 
IF YOU GOT 2 BILLION USERS, YOU 
CAN SEE HOW THOSE FINES WOULD 
MOUNT UP QUICKLY. 
IN THE COURSE OF YOUR AUDIT, 
ARE YOU EXTRAPOLATING DATA FOR 
THE PEOPLE AT THE FEDERAL TRADE 
COMMISSION FOR THE CONSENT 
DEGREE. 
>> ALMOST TIME.
>> ARE YOU MAKING INFORMATION 
FROM AUDITS AVAILABLE TO OUR 
FRIENDS AT THE AGENCY AT THE 
FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. 
>> THE FTC IS INVESTIGATING 
THIS. 
WE ARE GOING TO BE COMPLYING 
WITH THEM AND WORKING ON THAT 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> GENTLEMAN'S TIME EXPIRED. 
>> CHAIR RECOGNIZES MR. GREEN 
FOR FOUR MINUTES. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
WELCOME TO OUR COMMITTEE. 
I WANT TO FOLLOW-UP ON WHAT MY 
FRIEND FROM NORTH TEXAS TALKED 
ABOUT ON HIS CARTOON. 
NEXT MONTH THE GENERAL DATA 
PROTECTION DATA REGULATION, 
GDPR GOES INTO EFFECT IN THE 
EUROPEAN UNION. 
THAT IS PRESCRIPTIVE ON HOW 
COMPANIES TREAT CONSUMER DATA 
AND IT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT 
CONSUMERS NEED TO BE IN CONTROL 
OF THEIR OWN DATA. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK HAS 
COMMITTED TO ABIDING TO THESE 
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN EUROPE 
AND YOU FACE LARGE PENALTIES IF 
THEY DON'T. 
IN RECENT DAYS YOU SAY FACEBOOK 
CONTENDS TO MAKE THE SAME 
SETTINGS AVAILABLE TO USERS 
EVERYWHERE, NOT ONLY IN EUROPE. 
DID I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THAT 
FACEBOOK WOULD NOT ONLY MAKE 
THE SAME SETTINGS AVAILABLE BUT 
THE SAME PROTECTIONS AVAILABLE 
TO AMERICANS THAT THEY WILL THE 
EUROPEANS. 
>> THEY. 
ALL THE SAME CONTROLS WILL BE 
AVAILABLE AROUND THE WORLD. 
>> AND YOU COMMIT TODAY THAT 
FACEBOOK WILL EXTEND THE SAME 
PROTECTIONS TO AMERICANS THAT 
EUROPEAN USERS WILL RECEIVE 
UNDER THE GDPR? 
>> YES, CONGRESSMAN, WE BELIEVE 
EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD 
DESERVES GOOD PRIVACY CONTROLS. 
WE HAD A LOT OF THESE CONTROLS 
IN PLACE FOR YEARS. 
THE GDPR REQUIRES US TO DO A 
FEW MORE THINGS. 
WE WILL EXTEND THAT TO THE 
WORLD. 
>> THERE ARE MANY REQUIREMENTS 
IN THE GDPR. 
I WILL FOCUS ON A FEW. 
IT REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY'S 
REQUEST FOR USER CONSENT TO BE 
REQUESTED IN A CLEAR AND 
CONSIGNS WAY USING LANGUAGE 
THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE AND BE 
CLEARLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM 
OTHER PIECES OF INFORMATION 
INCLUDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 
HOW WILL THAT REQUIREMENT BE 
IMPLEMENTED IN THE UNITED 
STATES? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, WE ARE GOING TO 
PUT AT THE TOP OF EVERYONE'S 
APP WHEN THEY SIGN IN A TOOL 
THAT WALKS PEOPLE THROUGH THE 
SETTINGS AND GIVES PEOPLE THE 
CHOICES AND ASKS THEM TO MAKE 
DECISIONS ON HOW THEY WANT THE 
SETTINGS SET. 
>> ONE OF THE GDPR REQUIREMENT 
IS DATA PORTABILITY. 
USERS MUST BEABLE -- PERMITTED 
TO REQUEST A FULL COPY OF THEIR 
INFORMATION AND SHARE THAT 
INFORMATION WITH ANY COMPANIES 
THAT THEY WANT TO. 
I KNOW FACEBOOK ALLOWS USERS 
ABILITY OF USERS TO DOWNLOAD 
THE FACEBOOK DATA AS THE MEANS 
TO COMPLY WITH THE GDP OUR 
STATE AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENT?
>> CONGRESSMAN, I THINK WE MAY 
BE UPDATING INTO A LITTLE BIT 
BUT AS YOU SAY, WE HAVE HAD THE 
ABILITY TO DOWNLOAD YOUR 
INFORMATION, FOUR YEARS , NOW. 
AND PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO 
SEE EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAVE 
ON FACEBOOK AND DELETE THEIR 
ACCOUNT AND MOVE THEIR DATA 
ANYWHERE THEY WANT. 
>> DOES THAT INCLUDE ALL OF THE 
INFORMATION THAT FACEBOOK HAS 
COLLECTED ABOUT ANY ENDING -- 
ABOUT ANY GIVEN INDIVIDUAL? 
IS THERE OTHER INFORMATION 
ACCESSIBLE TO YOU OR FACEBOOK 
THAT I WOULD NOT SEE ON THAT 
DOCUMENT SUCH AS BROWSING 
HISTORY OR OTHER INFERENCES 
THAT FACEBOOK IS STRONG FOR 
ADVERTISING PURPOSES? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, I BELIEVE ALL 
OF YOUR INFORMATION IS IN THAT 
FILE. 
>> GDP D ALSO GIVES USERS THE 
RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE USE OF 
THEIR PERSONAL DATA FOR 
MARKETING PURPOSES WHICH 
ACCORDING TO FACEBOOK'S WEBSITE 
 
ADVERTISING. 
WITH THE SAME RIGHT BE TO 
OBJECT BE AVAILABLE TO FACEBOOK 
USERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND 
HOW WOULD THAT BE IMPLEMENTED?  
>>  CONGRESSMAN, I AM NOT SURE 
HOW WE ARE GOING TO IMPLEMENT  
THAT YET. 
LET ME FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. 
>> THANK YOU. 
AND THE FACEBOOK CONDUCTED A 
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, AND EFFORT 
IN HOUSTON FOR OUR SMALL 
BUSINESSES AND IT WAS ONE OF 
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL OUTREACHES 
I HAVE SEEN SO I APPRECIATE 
THAT OUTREACH AS YOU USE 
FACEBOOK TO MARKET THEIR 
PRODUCTS. 
THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. 
>> THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN. 
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE GENTLE 
LADY FROM TENNESSEE. 
>> MR. ZUCKERBERG, I THINK YOUR 
COZY COMMUNITY AS DOCTOR MARK 
JAMISON RECENTLY SAID, IS 
BEGINNING TO LOOK A WHOLE LOT 
LIKE THE TRUMAN SHOW WHERE 
PEOPLE'S IDENTITIES AND 
RELATIONSHIPS ARE MADE 
AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE THAT THEY 
DON'T KNOW. 
AND THEN, THAT DATA IS CRUNCHED 
AND IT IS USED. 
AND THEY ARE FULLY UNAWARE OF 
THIS. 
SO, I GOT TO ASK YOU -- I THINK 
WHAT WE ARE GETTING TO HERE IS 
WHO OWNS THE VIRTUAL YOU? 
WHO OWNS YOUR PRESENCE ONLINE? 
AND I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO 
COMMENT, WHO DO YOU THINK OWNS 
AN INDIVIDUAL'S PRESENCE 
ONLINE? 
WHO OWNS THEIR VIRTUAL YOU? 
IS IT YOU? 
OR IS IT THEM? 
>> I BELIEVE EVERYONE OWNS 
THEIR OWN CONTENT ONLINE AND 
THAT IS IN HOUR FIRST TERMS OF 
SERVICE IF YOU READ THAT. 
>> AND WHERE DOES PRIVACY RIGHT 
AS A CORPORATE VALUE FOR 
FACEBOOK? 
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, GIVING PEOPLE 
CONTROL OF THEIR INFORMATION 
AND HOW THEY WANT TO SET THEIR 
PRIVACY IS FOUNDATION TO THE 
WHOLE SERVICE, NOT JUST AN ADD-
ON FEATURE WE HAVE TO COMPLY 
WITH. 
THE REALITY IS, IF YOU HAVE A 
PHOTO -- JUST THINK ABOUT THIS 
IN YOUR DAY-TO-DAY LIFE -- 
>> I CANNOT LET YOU FILIBUSTER, 
RIGHT NOW. 
A CONSTITUENT OF MINE BROUGHT 
UP A GREAT QUESTION LAST WEEK 
AND SAID, YOU KNOW, HEALTHCARE, 
YOU'VE GOT HIPPO, THE FAIR 
CREDIT REPORTING AND THESE ARE 
ALL COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTS FOR 
PRIVACY, FOR OTHER SECTORS OF 
THE INDUSTRY. 
SHE WAS STUNNED! 
STUNNED! 
THAT THERE ARE NO PRIVACY 
DOCUMENTS THAT APPLY TO YOU 
ALL. 
AND WE HAVE HEARD PEOPLE SAY 
THAT -- YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE SAID 
-- YOU ARE CONSIDERING THAT 
MAYBE YOU NEED MORE 
REGULATIONS. 
WHAT WE THINK IS THAT WE NEED 
FOR YOU TO LOOK AT NEW 
LEGISLATION AND YOU ARE HEARING 
THAT THERE WILL BE MORE BILLS 
RIGHT OUT IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS 
BUT WE HAVE HAD A BILL, THE 
BROWSER ACT. 
AND I AM CERTAIN THAT YOU ARE 
FAMILIAR WITH THIS. 
IT IS BIPARTISAN AND I THINK 
MR. LAPINSKI AND MR. LANTZ AND 
MR. FLOREZ FOR THEIR WORK ON 
THIS LEGISLATION. 
WE HAVE HEADED FOR OVER A YEAR 
AND CERTAINLY, WE HAVE BEEN 
WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR ABOUT 
FOUR YEARS. 
WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS HAVE ONE 
REGULATOR, ONE SET OF RULES FOR 
THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM. 
AND WILL YOU COMMIT TO WORKING 
WITH US TO PASS PRIVACY 
LEGISLATION? 
TO PASS THE BROWSER ACT? 
WILL YOU COMMIT TO DOING THAT? 
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, I AM NOT 
DIRECTLY FAMILIAR WITH THE 
DETAILS OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID 
BUT I CERTAINLY THINK THAT 
REGULATION -- 
>> -- LET'S GET FAMILIAR WITH 
THE DETAILS. 
AS YOU HAVE HEARD, WE NEED SOME 
RULES AND REGULATIONS. 
THIS IS ONLY 13 PAGES. 
THE BROWSER ACT IS 13 PHASES -- 
PAGES AND YOU CAN EASILY BECOME 
FAMILIAR WITH IT AND WE WOULD 
APPRECIATE YOUR HELP. 
AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU AS MR. 
GRANGER SAID, AS YOU LOOK AT 
THE PRIVACY POLICIES, YOU ARE 
ALREADY DOING MUCH OF THAT IF 
YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING YOU 
CLAIM BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE TO 
ALLOW CONSUMERS TO CONTROL 
THEIR DATA, TO CHANGE, TO ERASE 
IT. 
YOU HAVE TO GIVE CONSUMERS OPT 
IN SO THAT MOTHERS KNOW -- MY 
CONSTITUENTS IN TENNESSEE WANT 
TO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT 
TO PRIVACY. AND WE WOULD HOPE 
THAT THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU 
ALL. 
I WANT TO MOVE ON AND ASK YOU 
SOMETHING ELSE. 
AND PLEASE GET BACK TO ME ONCE 
YOU HAVE REVIEWED THE BROWSER 
ACT. 
I WOULD APPRECIATE HEARING FROM 
YOU. 
WE HAVE DONE ONE HEARING ON 
ALGORITHMS. 
OUR CHAIR COMMUNICATIONS AND 
TECHNOLOGY SUBCOMMITTEE HERE, 
WE ARE GETTING READY TO DO A 
SECOND ONE ON OUR RHYTHMS. 
WE WILL DO ONE NEXT WEEK ON 
PRIORITIZATION. 
SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU, DO 
YOU SUBJECTIVELY TO BE LATE 
YOUR ALGORITHMS TO PRIORITIZE 
OR CENSOR SPEECH?   
>>  CONGRESSWOMAN,  WE DON'T 
THINK ABOUT WOOLFORD DURING A 
CENSORING SPEECH. 
THERE ARE TYPES OF CONTENT LIKE 
TERRORISM THAT I THINK WE ALL 
AGREE WE DO NOT WANT TO HAVE ON 
OUR SERVICE. 
SO WE BUILT SYSTEMS THAT CAN 
IDENTIFY THOSE AND CAN REMOVE 
THAT CONTENT AND WE ARE VERY 
PROUD OF THAT WORK. 
>> LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING 
RIGHT NOW: DOMINANCE SILK IS 
NOT TERRORISM. 
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM COLORADO FOR 
FOUR MINUTES. 
>> MR. ZUCKERBERG, WE 
APPRECIATE YOUR CONTRITION AND 
WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT 
TO RESOLVING THESE PAST 
PROBLEMS. 
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND FROM MY 
COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE 
AISLE IN THIS COMMITTEE, WE ARE 
INTERESTED IN LOOKING FORWARD 
TO PREVENTING THIS TYPE OF 
ACTIVITY, NOT JUST WITH 
FACEBOOK BUT WITH OTHERS IN 
YOUR INDUSTRY AND AS AS BEEN 
NOTED BY MANY PEOPLE ALREADY, 
WE HAVE BEEN RELYING ON SELF-
REGULATION IN YOUR INDUSTRY, 
FOR THE MOST PART. 
WE ARE TRYING TO EXPLORE WHAT 
WE CAN DO TO PREVENT FURTHER 
BREACHES. 
SO I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A WHOLE 
SERIES OF FAIRLY QUICK 
QUESTIONS AND THEY SHOULD ONLY 
REQUIRE YES OR NO ANSWERS. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, AT THE END OF 
2017, FACEBOOK HAD A TOTAL 
SHAREHOLDER EQUITY OF JUST OVER 
$74 BILLION, IS THAT CORRECT?   
>>  SORRY, CONGRESSWOMAN, I AM 
NOT FAMILIAR. 
>> AT THE END OF 2017, FACEBOOK 
HAD A TOTAL SHAREHOLDER EQUITY 
OF OVER $74 BILLION, CORRECT ? 
>> OVER THAT? 
>> YOU ARE THE CEO. THE COMPANY 
WAS GREATER THAN 74 POINT 
>> LAST YEAR, FACEBOOK EARNED A 
PROFIT OF $15.9 BILLION ON 
40.70 BILLION DOLLARS IN 
REVENUE, CORRECT? 
YES OR NO? 
SINCE THE REVELATIONS 
SURROUNDING CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA, FACEBOOK HAS NOT 
NOTICED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE 
IN USERS DEACTIVATING THEIR 
ACCOUNTS; IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> YES. 
>> SINCE THE REVELATIONS 
SURROUNDING CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA,
FACEBOOK HAS ALSO NOT NOTICED A 
DECREASE IN USER INTERACTION ON 
FACEBOOK; CORRECT? 
>> YES, THAT IS CORRECT. 
>> OKAY. 
NOW, I WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE TO 
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE CIVIL 
AND REGULATORY PENALTIES THAT 
WE ARE SEEING. 
I AM AWARE OF TWO CLASS-ACTION 
LAWSUITS THAT FACEBOOK HAS 
SETTLED RELATING TO PRIVACY 
CONCERNS. 
LANE VERSUS FACEBOOK WAS 
SETTLED IN 2010. 
THAT CASE RESULTED IN NO MONEY 
BEING AWARDED TO FACEBOOK USERS
; IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, I AM NOT 
FAMILIAR WITH THE DETAILS OF 
THAT. 
>> YOU ARE THE CEO OF THE 
COMPANY, CORRECT? 
>> YES. 
>> THIS MAJOR LAWSUIT WAS 
SETTLED. 
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE LAWSUIT?  
>>  CONGRESSWOMAN, I GET 
BRIEFED ON THESE  -- 
>> YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS LAWSUIT, 
LANE VERSUS FACEBOOK? 
YES OR NO? 
>> I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE 
DEAL. 
>> I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE 
WAS A LAWSUIT AND THE USERS GOT 
NOTHING. 
IN ANOTHER CASE, FREELY VERSUS 
FACEBOOK, IT RESULTED IN A 2013 
SETTLEMENT FUND OF $20 MILLION 
BEING ESTABLISHED WITH $15 
INDIVIDUAL PAYOUTS TO FACEBOOK 
USERS BEGINNINGIN 2016, IS 
THAT CORRECT? 
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, I AM NOT 
FAMILIAR WITH IT. 
>> YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT 
WHEN EITHER? 
>> I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT 
DETAILS. 
>> OKAY. 
AS THE RESULT OF THE 2011 FTC 
INVESTIGATION INTO FACEBOOK'S 
PRIVACY POLICY, DO YOU KNOW 
ABOUT THAT ONE?   
>>  THE FTC INVESTIGATION? 
YES. 
>> YOU ENTERED INTO A DISSENT  
AGREE WITH THE FTC WHICH CARRY 
NO FINANCIAL PENALTIES FOR 
FACEBOOK, IS THAT CORRECT?    
>>  CONGRESSWOMAN, I DON'T 
REMEMBER IF WE HAD A FINANCIAL 
PENALTY. 
>> YOU ARE THE CEO OF THE 
COMPANY AND YOU ENTERED INTO A 
DISSENT DECREE AND YOU DON'T 
REMEMBER IF YOU HAD A  
FINANCIAL DECREE. 
>> -- 
>> I WOULD THINK A FINANCIAL 
PENALTY WOULD, AS WELL? 
OKAY. 
THE REASON YOU PROBABLY DON'T 
REMEMBER IT IS BECAUSE THE FTC 
DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO 
ISSUE FINANCIAL PENALTIES FOR 
FIRST-TIME VIOLATIONS. 
THE REASON I AM ASKING THESE 
QUESTIONS, SIR, IS BECAUSE WE 
CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE ABUSES 
AND THESE DATA BREACHES BUT AT 
THE SAME TIME, IT DOESN'T SEEM 
LIKE FUTURE ACTIVITIES ARE 
PREVENTED. 
SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT IN THE 
FUTURE AS WE WORK WITH YOU AND 
OTHERS IN THE INDUSTRY IS 
PUTTING ROBUST PENALTIES IN 
PLACE IN CASE OF IMPROPER 
ACTIONS. 
THAT IS WHY I ASKED THESE 
QUESTIONS. 
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM LOUISIANA, THE 
WHIP OF THE HOUSE, MR. SCALISE. 
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN AND 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, I APPRECIATE 
YOU COMING HERE. 
AS SOME OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES 
MENTIONED, YOU CAME HERE 
VOLUNTARILY TO HAVE THIS 
DISCUSSION BECAUSE CLEARLY, 
WHAT YOUR COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE 
TO DO IS REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY 
PEOPLE CAN CONNECT AND THERE IS 
A TREMENDOUS BENEFIT TO OUR 
COUNTRY, NOW IT IS A WORLDWIDE 
PLATFORM AND IT IS CREATING 
SHORTAGES OF COMPUTER 
PROGRAMMERS. 
AS A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER, I 
THINK WE WOULD BOTH AGREE THAT 
WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE MORE 
PEOPLE TO GO INTO THE COMMUTER 
SCIENCES BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS 
A WORLD LEADER THINGS TO YOUR 
COMPANY AND SO MANY OTHERS BUT 
IT OBVIOUSLY RAISES QUESTIONS 
ABOUT PRIVACY AND DATA AND HOW 
THE DATA IS SHARED AND WHAT IS 
THE USER'S EXPECTATION OF WHERE 
THE DATA GOES? 
SO I WANT TO ASK A FEW 
QUESTIONS. 
FIRST, DO YOU AGREE THAT WE 
NEED MORE COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS 
AND PEOPLE TO GO INTO THAT 
FIELD? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, YES. 
>> THAT IS A PUBLIC SERVICE 
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE JUST MADE 
AND I APPRECIATE YOU JOINING ME 
IN THAT. 
AND THE QUESTION WAS REALLY A 
FOLLOW-UP QUESTION TO YOU 
YESTERDAY THAT YOU WERE NOT 
ABLE TO ANSWER BUT IT WAS, 
DEALING WITH HOW FACEBOOK 
TRACKS USERS. ESPECIALLY, AFTER 
THEY LOG OFF. 
AND YOU HAD SAID IN 
RELATIONSHIP TO THE 
CONGRESSMAN'S QUESTION THAT 
THERE IS DATA MINING BUT IT 
GOES ON FOR SECURITY PURPOSES. 
SO MY QUESTION WOULD BE, IS 
THAT DATA THAT IS MINED FOR 
SECURITY PURPOSES ALSO USED TO 
SELL AS PART OF THE BUSINESS 
MODEL?   
>>  CONGRESSMAN, I BELIEVE 
THOSE ARE  -- THAT WE COLLECT 
DIFFERENT DATA FOR THOSE BUT I 
CAN FOLLOW UP ON THE DETAILS OF 
IT. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
IF YOU COULD FOLLOW-UP, I WOULD 
APPRECIATE THAT. 
GETTING INTO THIS NEW REALM OF 
CONTENT REVIEW, I KNOW THAT 
SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK 
FOR FACEBOOK, CAMPBELL BROWN, 
FOR EXAMPLE -- THIS IS CHANGING 
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH 
PUBLISHERS AND FACING SOMETHING 
FACEBOOK HAS NEVER DONE BEFORE 
-- IT IS HAVING A POINT OF VIEW
. AND YOU MENTIONED THE DIAMOND 
 
DESCRIBED IT AS A MISTAKE WHERE 
THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THAT 
MISTAKE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN ANY 
WAY -- OR THE PEOPLE OF THAT 
MISTAKE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN ANY 
WAY?    
>>  CONGRESSMAN, LET ME FOLLOW 
UP ON THAT. 
I AM NOT AWARE OF THE DETAILS. 
>> I DO WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT A 
STUDY THAT WAS DONE DEALING 
WITH THE ALGORITHM THAT 
FACEBOOK USES  TO DESCRIBE WHAT 
IS FED TO PEOPLE THROUGH THE 
NEWSFEED AND WHAT THEY FOUND 
WAS, AFTER THIS NEW ALGORITHM 
WAS IMPLEMENTED, THAT THERE WAS 
A TREMENDOUS BIASED -- BIAS 
AGAINST NEWS AND CONTENT AND A 
FAVORABLE BIAS TOWARD LIBERAL 
CONTENT AND IF YOU LOOK AT 
THAT, THAT SHOWS A 16 POINT 
DISPARITY WHICH IS CONCERNING. 
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE NOT 
GOING TO WANT TO SHARE THE 
ALGORITHM, ITSELF, WITH US. 
I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU IF YOU 
WANTED TO DO THAT BUT WHO 
DEVELOPS THE ALGORITHM? 
I WROTE ALGORITHMS BEFORE AND 
YOU CAN DETERMINE WHETHER OR 
NOT YOU WANT TO WRITE AN 
ALGORITHM TO SORT DATA, TO 
COMPARTMENTALIZE DATA BUT YOU 
CAN ALSO PUT IN A BIAS IF THAT 
IS A DIRECTIVE. 
WAS THERE A DIRECTIVE TO PUT 
THE BIAS IN? 
FIRST, ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS 
BIAS THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE 
LOOKED AT AND ANALYZED AND 
SEEN?   
>>  CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS A 
REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION . 
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO 
DIRECTIVE IN ANY OF THE CHANGES 
WE MADE TO HAVE A BIAS IN 
ANYTHING WE DO. 
TO THE CONTRARY. 
OUR GOAL IS TO BE A PLATFORM 
FOR ALL IDEAS. 
>> WE ARE ALMOST OUT OF TIME. 
IF YOU CAN GO BACK AND 
DETERMINE IF THERE WAS A BIAS, 
WHOEVER DEVELOPED THAT SOFTWARE 
DOES YOU HAVE 20,000 PEOPLE WHO 
DEVELOP THIS DATA ANALYSIS -- 
IF YOU COULD LOOK AND SEE IF 
THERE IS A BIAS AND LET US KNOW 
IF THERE IS AND WHAT YOU ARE 
DOING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THAT IS 
DISTURBING WHEN YOU SEE THAT 
KIND OF DISPARITY. 
FINALLY, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT 
OF TALK ABOUT CAMBRIDGE AND 
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE LAST 
CAMPAIGN. 
IN 2008 AND 2012, THERE WAS 
ALSO A LOT OF THIS DONE. 
ONE OF THE LEAD DIGITAL HEADS 
OF THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN SAID, 
RECENTLY, FACEBOOK WAS 
SURPRISED WE WERE ABLE TO SUCK 
OUT THE WHOLE SOCIAL GRAPH THAT 
THEY DID NOT STOP US ONCE THEY 
REALIZED THAT WAS WHAT WE WERE 
DOING. 
THEY CAME TO THE OFFICE IN THE 
DAYS FOLLOWING THE ELECTION IN 
RECRUITED AND WERE CANDID THAT 
THEY ALLOWED US TO DO THINGS 
THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW OTHERS TO 
DO BECAUSE THEY WERE ON OUR 
SIDE. 
THAT IS A DIRECT QUOTE FROM ONE 
OF THE HEADS OF THE OBAMA 
DIGITAL TEAM. 
WHAT DID SHE MEAN BY THAT, 
FACEBOOK, WERE ON OUR SIDE? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, WE DID NOT 
ALLOW THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN TO DO 
ANYTHING THAT ANYONE ELSE ON 
THE PLATFORM WOULD NOT HAVE 
BEEN ABLE TO DO. 
>> THAT IS AN INACCURATE 
STATEMENT IN YOUR OPINION? 
>> YES. 
>> WE RECOGNIZE THE GENTLEMAN 
FROM PENNSYLVANIA, MR. DOYLE. 
>> THANK YOU. 
ESTHER ZUCKERBERG, WELCOME. 
FACEBOOK USES SOME OF THE MOST 
ADVANCED DATA PROCESSING 
TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES ON 
THE PLANET, CORRECT? 
YES OR NO.
>> WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON DOING 
GOOD. 
>> THANK YOU. 
AND YOU USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES 
TO IDENTIFY OFFENSIVE CONTACT 
AND TRACK USER ACTIVITY, RIGHT? 
>> AMONG OTHER THINGS. 
>> IN 2015 WHEN THE GUARDIAN 
FIRST REPORTED ON AVERAGE AT 
ONLY TWO USING FACEBOOK USER 
DATA, WAS THAT THE FIRST TIME 
FACEBOOK LEARNED ABOUT THESE 
ALLEGATIONS?   
>>  CONGRESSMAN, IN 2015 WHEN 
WE HEARD  THAT THE DEVELOPER ON 
THE PLATFORM, ALEXANDER -- 
>> -- WAS THAT THE FIRST TIME 
YOU HEARD ABOUT IT? 
WHEN THE GUARDIAN MADE THE 
REPORT, WAS THAT THE FIRST TIME 
YOU HEARD ABOUT IT? 
THANK YOU. 
SO -- LEARNED ABOUT THESE 
VIOLATIONS THROUGH THE PRESS? 
>> SOMETIMES WE DO. 
I GENERALLY THINK THAT -- 
>> -- LET ME ASK YOU THIS: YOU 
HAD THE CAPABILITY OF ALTERING 
FACEBOOK USER DATA AND DO MORE 
TO PREVENT THESE ABUSES BUT THE 
PROBLEM THAT FACEBOOK NOT ONLY 
PERSISTED BUT PROLIFERATED. 
IN FACT, RELATIVE TO OTHER 
TYPES OF PROBLEMS THAT YOU HAD 
ON YOUR PLATFORM, IT SEEMS AS 
THOUGH YOU TURNED A BLIND EYE 
TO THIS, CORRECT? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, I DISAGREE WITH 
THAT ASSESSMENT. 
I DO THINK THAT GOING FORWARD, 
WE NEED TO TAKE A MORE 
PROACTIVE VIEW OF POLICING WITH 
THE DEVELOPERS -- WHAT THE 
DEVELOPERS DO BUT LOOKING BACK, 
WE HAVE HAD A PROCESS, WE 
INVESTIGATE. 
>> MR. ZUCKERBERG, IT SEEMS TO 
US THAT YOU WERE MORE CONCERNED 
WITH ATTRACTING AND RETAINING 
DEVELOPERS ON YOUR PLATFORM 
THEN YOU ARE WITH ENSURING THE 
SECURITY OF FACEBOOK USER DATA. 
LET ME SWITCH GEARS. 
YOUR COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A 20 
YEAR CONSENT DECREE WITH THE 
FTC SINCE 2011, CORRECT?   
>>  CONGRESSMAN, WE HAVE A 
DISSENT  DOES CONSENT DECREE, 
YES. 
>> AND THAT EMERGED OUT OF A 
NUMBER OF PRACTICES THAT 
FACEBOOK ENGAGED IN THAT THE FTC
DEEMED TO BE UNFAIR AND 
DECEPTIVE. 
ONE SUCH PRACTICE WAS MAKING 
FACEBOOK USERS PRIVATE 
INFORMATION PUBLIC WITHOUT 
SUFFICIENT NOTICE OR CONSENT. 
CLAIMING THAT FACEBOOK SIGNED 
BY THE SECURITY AND INTEGRITY 
OF CERTAIN APPS WHEN, IN FACT, 
IT DID NOT. 
AND ENABLE DEVELOPERS TO ACCESS 
CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT A 
USER AND THEIR FRIENDS, IS THAT 
CORRECT? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, I AM NOT 
FAMILIAR WITH ALL OF THE THINGS 
THAT THE FTC SAID. 
>> BUT THESE WERE PART OF THE 
CONSENT DECREE. 
SO I AM JUST CONCERNED THAT 
DESPITE THIS DISSENT DECREE, 
FACEBOOK TO AN UNKNOWN USER -- 
NUMBER OF YEARS IS FOUR YEARS. 
POTENTIALLY, HUNDREDS OF 
MILLION. 
POTENTIALLY MORE. 
BUT NOT ONLY ALLOWED THE 
PARTNERED WITH INDIVIDUALS SUCH 
AS ALEKSANDR KOGAN WE TURNED 
AROUND AND SOLD THAT DATA ON 
THE OPEN MARKET AND TO 
COMPANIES LIKE CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA. MR. ZUCKERBERG, YOU 
HAVE SAID THAT YOU PLAN TO 
AUDIT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
DEVELOPERS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN 
PROPERLY HARVESTED FACEBOOK 
USER DATA. 
YOU ALSO SAID THAT YOU PLAN TO 
GIVE ALL FACEBOOK USERS ACCESS 
TO SOME USER CONTROLS THAT WILL 
BE MADE AVAILABLE IN THE EU 
UNDER THE GDP ARE. 
BUT IT STRIKES ME THAT THERE IS 
A REAL TRUST GAP, HERE. 
THIS DEVELOPER DATA ISSUE IS 
JUST ONE EXAMPLE. 
BUT WHY SHOULD WE TRUST YOU TO 
FOLLOW THROUGH ON THESE 
PROMISES WHEN YOU HAVE 
DEMONSTRATED REPEATEDLY THAT 
YOU ARE WILLING TO LAUNCH YOUR 
INTERNAL POLICIES AND 
GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT WHEN THE 
NEED SUITS YOU. 
>> CONGRESSMAN, RESPECTFULLY, I 
DISAGREE WITH THAT 
CHARACTERIZATION. 
WE HAVE HAD A REVIEW PROCESS 
FOR APPS, FOUR YEARS. 
WE HAVE REVIEWED TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF APPS PER YEAR AND 
TAKEN ACTION AGAINST A NUMBER 
OF THEM. 
OUR PROCESS WAS NOT ENOUGH TO 
CATCH A DEVELOPER.    
>>  MY TIME IS ALMOST OVER AND 
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT TO MY 
MIND, THE ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING 
TO CLOSE THIS TRUST GAP IS THE 
LEGISLATION THAT CREATES  A 
SUFFICIENTLY RESOURCE EXPERT 
OVERSIGHT AGENCY WITH 
RULEMAKING AUTHORITY TO PROTECT 
THE DIGITAL PRIVACY AND ENSURE 
THAT COMPANIES PROTECT OUR 
USERS DATA. 
I YIELD BACK. 
>> THE GENTLEMAN'S TIME HAS 
EXPIRED. 
WE RECOGNIZE MR. LATTA OF OHIO 
FOR FOUR MINUTES. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN AND 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, TAKE YOU SO 
MUCH FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. 
THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS, 
CAN YOU TELL THE FACEBOOK USERS 
THAT THE RUSSIANS AND THE 
CHINESE HAVE NOT USED AS A 
METHOD AS OTHER PARTIES -- 
THIRD PARTIES FOR GAIN? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, WE HAVE NOT 
SEEN THAT ACTIVITY. 
>> NONE AT ALL? 
>> NOT THAT I AM AWARE OF. 
>> OKAY. 
LET ME ASK THIS QUESTION: A 
LITTLE BIT HAS BEEN GOING ON 
WHEN YOU MADE YOUR OPENING 
STATEMENT IN REGARDS TO WHAT 
YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE DONE WITH 
THE COMPANY AND STEPS MOVING 
FORWARD. 
THERE'S A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS 
ABOUT, YOU'RE GOING TO BE 
INVESTIGATING THE APPS. 
HOW MANY APPS ARE THERE OUT 
THERE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO 
INVESTIGATE? 
>> THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS 
OF APPS THAT HAVE ACCESS TO A 
LARGE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE'S 
INFORMATION BEFORE WE LOCKED 
DOWN THE PLATFORM IN 2014. 
WE ARE GOING TO DO AN 
INVESTIGATION THAT FIRST 
INVOLVES LOOKING AT THE 
PATTERNS AND EPI ACCESS AND 
WHAT THOSE COMPANIES WERE DOING
. AND THEN, IF WE FIND ANYTHING 
SUSPICIOUS, WE ARE GOING TO 
BRING IN THIRD-PARTY AUDITORS 
TO GO THROUGH THEIR TECHNICAL 
AND PHYSICAL SYSTEMS TO 
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY DID AND IF 
WE FIND THEY MISUSED ANY DATA, 
WE WILL BAN THEM FROM OUR 
PLATFORM. 
MAKE SURE THEY DO DELETE THE 
DATA AND TELL EVERYONE 
AFFECTED. 
>> JUST A FOLLOW-UP, HOW LONG 
WOULD IT TAKE TO INVESTIGATE 
EACH ONE OF THOSE APPS ONCE YOU 
ARE DOING THAT? 
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT TENS OF 
THOUSANDS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO 
THAT ENTIRE PROCESS. 
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO REACH 
EVERYONE ON THOSE APPS? 
>> IT WILL TAKE MANY MONTHS TO 
DOTHIS FULL PROCESS. 
AND IT IS GOING TO BE AN 
EXPENSIVE PROCESS WITH A LOT OF 
AUDITORS BUT WE THINK THIS IS 
THE RIGHT THING TO DO AT THIS 
POINT. 
BEFORE WE THOUGHT THAT WHEN 
DEVELOPERS TOLD US THAT THEY 
WERE NOT GOING TO SELL THE DATA 
THAT THAT WAS A GOOD 
REPRESENTATION. 
BUT ONE OF THE BIG LESSONS WE 
HAVE LEARNED IS THAT CLEARLY, 
WE CANNOT JUST TAKE DEVELOPERS 
WORD FOR IT. 
WE NEED TO GO IN AND ENFORCE 
THAT. 
>> OKAY. 
THE THING ABOUT AUDITS, THERE 
ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS. 
ON THE ON IT IN 2011, FACEBOOK 
DID SIGN THAT DISSENT ORDER 
WITH THE FEDERAL TRADE 
COMMISSION FOR THE PRIVACY 
VIOLATIONS. 
PART OF THAT CONSENT ORDER 
REQUIRES FACEBOOK TO SUBMIT 
THIRD-PARTY PRIVACY AUDITS TO 
THE FTC EVERY 32 YEARS -- EVERY 
TWO YEARS. 
FIRST, ARE YOU AWARE OF THE 
AUDIENCE AND SECOND, WHY DIDN'T 
THE AUDIT DISCLOSE OR FIND 
THESE ISSUES WITH USERS DATA? 
>> YES, CONGRESSMAN. 
I AM AWARE OF THE AUDITS THAT 
WE DO. 
WE DO THEM EVERY OTHER YEAR AND 
THEY ARE ONGOING. 
THE AUDITS HAVE NOT FOUND 
MATERIAL ISSUES. 
I THINK THE BROADER QUESTION 
HERE IS, WE HAVE HAD THE FTC 
CONSENT DEGREE BUT WE TAKE A 
BROADER VIEW OF WHAT OUR 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR PEOPLE'S 
úPR 
AND, OUR VIEW IS THAT WHAT THE 
DEVELOPER DID THAT THEY 
REPRESENT TO US THAT THEY ARE 
GOING TO USE THE DATA IN A 
CERTAIN WAY AND THEN WENT OUT 
AND SOLD IT. 
WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS THE 
VIOLATION OF THE DISSENT DECREE 
BUT IT IS CLEARLY A BREACH OF 
TRUST AND THE STANDARD THAT WE 
HOLD OURSELVES TO IS NOT JUST 
FOLLOWING THE LAWS THAT ARE IN 
PLACE BUT WE JUST WANT TO TAKE 
A BROADER VIEW OF THIS.>> ARE 
YOU AWARE THAT FACEBOOK DID 
PROVIDE THE AUDITORS 
INFORMATION IS REQUESTED DURING 
THE FTC AUDITS? 
>> SORRY, CAN YOU REPEAT THAT? 
>> DID FACEBOOK PROVIDE THE 
AUDITORS WITH ALL OF THE 
INFORMATION REQUESTED TO 
PREPARE FOR THE AUDIT WITH THE 
FTC? 
>> I BELIEVE WE DO PREPARE THE 
AUDITS. 
>> WERE YOU ASKED PERSONAL 
INFORMATION OR FEEDBACK IN 
THESE AUDITS TO THE FTC?    
>>  CONGRESSMAN, NOT 
PERSONALLY. 
ALTHOUGH, I AM BRIEFED  ON THE 
AUDITS BY OUR TEAM. 
>> MY TIME HAS EXPIRED. I GET 
BACK. 
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES 
CHUDOWSKI FOR FOUR MINUTES.    
>>  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
YOU HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF 
GROWTH AND SUCCESS BUT YOU ALSO 
HAVE A LONG LIST OF APOLOGIES  
IN 2003, IT STARTED, AT 
HARVARD. 
I APOLOGIZE FOR ANY HARM DONE 
AS A RESULT OF MY. 
2006, WE REALLY MISSED THIS ONE 
UP. 2007, WE SIMPLY DID A BAD 
JOB. 
I APOLOGIZE FOR IT. 
2010, SOMETIMES WE MOVE TOO 
FAST. 
2011, I AM THE FIRST TO ADMIT 
THAT WE MADE A BUNCH OF 
MISTAKES. 
2017, -- THIS IS IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE RUSSIAN MANIPULATION 
OF THE ELECTION AND THE DATA 
THAT CAME FROM FACEBOOK, 
INITIALLY. 
I ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS. 
I WILL WORK TO DO BETTER. 
SO, IT SEEMS TO ME FROM THIS 
HISTORY THAT SELF-REGULATION 
DOES THIS IS PROOF TO ME THAT 
SELF-REGULATION SIMPLY DOES NOT 
WORK. 
I HAVE A BILL, THE SECURE AND 
PROTECT AMERICANS DATA ACT THAT 
I HOPE YOU WILL TAKE A LOOK AT, 
IT IS A VERY SIMPLE BILL ABOUT 
SETTING STANDARDS FOR HOW YOU 
MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA IS 
PROTECTED, DEADLINES ON HOW YOU 
RELEASE THAT INFORMATION TO THE 
PUBLIC. 
CERTAINLY, IT OUGHT TO GO TO 
THE FTC, AS WELL. 
BUT IN RESPONSE TO THE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE APPS AND 
THE INVESTIGATION THAT YOU ARE 
GOING TO DO, YOU SAID YOU DON'T 
NECESSARILY KNOW HOW LONG. 
HAVE YOU SENT ANY DEADLINE FOR 
THAT? 
BECAUSE WE KNOW AS MY COLLEAGUE 
SAID THAT THERE ARE TENS OF 
THOUSANDS -- THERE HAVE 
ACTUALLY BEEN 9 MILLION APPS. 
HOW LONG DO WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR 
THAT KIND OF INVESTIGATION? 
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, WE EXPECT IT 
TO TAKE ANY MONTHS.   
>>  YEARS?     
>>  I HOPE NOT. 
>> OKAY. 
I WANT  TO ASK YOU -- 
YESTERDAY, FOLLOWING UP ON YOUR 
RESPONSE TO SENATOR BALDWIN'S 
QUESTION, YOU SAID YESTERDAY 
THAT KOGAN ALSO SOLD DATA TO 
OTHER FIRMS. 
YOU NAMED NORIO, TECHNOLOGIES. 
HOW MANY ARE THERE TOTAL AND 
WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES? 
CAN WE GET THAT? 
AND HOW MANY ARE THERE TOTAL?   
>>  CONGRESSWOMAN, WE CAN 
FOLLOW UP WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE 
YOU GET ALL OF THAT 
INFORMATION. 
>> YES BUT ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ? 
>> I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS A 
LARGE NUMBER BUT AS WE COMPLETE 
THE AUDITS, WE WILL KNOW MORE. 
>> WHAT IS A LARGE NUMBER? 
>> A HANDFUL. 
>> HAS FACEBOOK TRIED TO GET 
THOSE FIRMS TO DELETE FACEBOOK 
DATA AND ITS DERIVATIVES? 
>> YES, CONGRESSWOMAN. 
IN 2015 WHEN WE FIRST LEARNED 
ABOUT IT, WE IMMEDIATELY 
DEMANDED THAT THE DEVELOPER AND 
THE FIRMS HE SOLD IT TO DELETE 
THE DATA AND THEY ALL 
REPRESENTED TO US THAT THEY 
HAD. 
IT WAS NOT UNTIL ONE MONTH AGO 
THAT NEW REPORTS SUGGESTED THAT 
THEY HADN'T WHICH IS WHAT HAS 
KICKED OFF US NEEDING TO NOW GO 
TO THIS FULL AUDIT AND 
INVESTIGATION AND INVEST ALL OF 
THESE -- AND INVESTIGATE ALL OF 
THESE OTHER APPS. 
>> DERIVATIVES? 
>> NEED TO COMPLETE THE AUDIT 
BEFORE I CAN CONFIRM THAT. 
WE NEED TO GET INTO THEIR 
SYSTEMS AND CONFIRM BEFORE I 
WANT TO STAND APPEAR, 
CONFIDENTLY, AND SAY. 
>> MR. GREEN ASKED ABOUT THE 
GENERAL DATA PROTECTION 
REGULATION ON MAY 25 -- IT IS 
GOING TO GO INTO EFFECT BY THE 
EU. 
AND YOUR RESPONSE WAS -- LET ME 
ASK: IS YOUR RESPONSE THAT 
EXACTLY THE PROTECTIONS THAT 
ARE GUARANTEED -- NOT THE -- 
WHAT DID YOU SAY? 
NOT THE -- JUST THE CONTROLS, 
BUT ALL THE RIGHTS THAT ARE 
GUARANTEED UNDER THE GENERAL 
DATA PROJECTION REGULATIONS 
WILL BE APPLIED TO AMERICANS, 
AS WELL? 
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, THE GDPR HAS 
A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT IMPORTANT 
PIECES. 
ONE IS A ROUND OFFERING 
CONTROLS OVER SPECIFIC, OVER 
EVERY USE. 
THAT WE ARE DOING. 
THE SECOND ONE IS AROUND 
PUSHING FOR AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT 
INCLUDING A CONTROL IN FRONT OF 
PEOPLE THAT WALK PEOPLE THROUGH 
THEIR CHOICES. 
WE DO THAT, AS WELL. 
THE SECOND -- ALTHOUGH, THAT 
MIGHT BE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON 
THE SPECIFIC MALLS AND COUNTRIES
THAT WE WILL PUT A TOOL THAT 
WALKS THEM THROUGH THEIR 
SETTINGS AND HELP THEM 
UNDERSTAND. 
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WILL NOT 
BE EXACT. 
AS WE LOOK AT DISTRIBUTION OF 
YOUR INFORMATION, WHO IS GOING 
TO PROTECT US FROM FACEBOOK IS 
ALSO A QUESTION. 
>> YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED. 
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM WASHINGTON 
STATE, THE CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN. 
>>  YES, THANK YOU. 
AND THANK YOU, MR. ZUCKERBERG, 
FOR JOINING US.  
TODAY IS CLEARLY TIMELY AND 
THERE'S A NUMBER OF EXTREMELY 
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. 
AMERICANS HAVE ABOUT FACEBOOK 
INCLUDING SECURITY OF THEIR 
DATA, ABOUT THE PROCESS BY WHICH
THEIR DATA IS MADE AVAILABLE TO 
THIRD PARTIES, ABOUT WHAT 
FACEBOOK IS DOING TO PROTECT 
CONSUMER PRIVACY AS WE MOVE 
FORWARD BUT ONE OF THE ISSUES 
THAT IS CONCERNING ME AND I 
WOULD LIKE TO DIG INTO IS HOW 
FACEBOOK TREATS CONTENT ON ITS 
PLATFORM. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, GIVEN THE 
EXTENSIVE REACH THOSE BREACH OF 
FACEBOOK AND ITS WIDESPREAD USE 
AS A TOOL OF EXPRESSION, DO YOU 
THINK FACEBOOK HAS THE UNIQUE 
RESPONSIBILITY TO ASSURE THAT 
IT HAS CLEAR STANDARDS IN 
REGARDING CLEAR CENSORSHIP ON 
ITS PLATFORM AND DO YOU THINK 
FACEBOOK ADEQUATELY AND CLEARLY 
DEFINES WHAT THE STANDARDS ARE 
FOR ITS USERS? 
>> YES, I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A 
VERY IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY 
TO OUTLINE WHAT THE CONTENT 
POLICIES ARE AND WHAT THE 
COMMUNITY STANDARDS ARE. 
THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT, 
FRANKLY, I AM WORRIED THAT WE 
ARE NOT DOING A GOOD ENOUGH JOB 
AT RIGHT NOW. 
ESPECIALLY, BECAUSE AT -- AS AN 
AMERICAN BASED COMPANY WHERE 
NOT A % OR OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. 
AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT SOCIAL 
NORMS IN DIFFERENT CULTURES, IT 
IS NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT OUR 
CURRENT SITUATION OF HOW WE 
DEFINE COMMUNITY STANDARDS IS 
GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE AND 
ARTICULATE AROUND THE WORLD SO 
WE ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT 
WAYS TO EVOLVE THAT AND I THINK 
THIS IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT 
THINGS THAT WE WILL DO. 
>> OKAY AND EVEN FOCUSING ON 
CONTENT HERE IN AMERICA, I 
WOULD LIKE TO SHIFT GEARS JUST 
A LITTLE BIT AND TALK ABOUT 
FACEBOOK'S RECENT CHANGES TO 
ITS NEW FEED ALGORITHM. 
YOUR HEAD UP NEWS PARTNERSHIPS 
RECENTLY SAID THAT FACEBOOK IS 
"TAKING A STEP TO DEFINE WHAT 
QUALITY NEWS LOOKS LIKE AND 
GIVE THAT A BOOST SO THAT 
OVERALL, THERE IS LESS 
COMPETITION FROM NEWS." 
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT SHE MEANS 
BY "LESS COMPETITION FROM NEWS
?" AND HOW DOES FACEBOOK 
OBJECTIVELY DETERMINE WHAT IS 
SAFE NEWS AND WHAT SAFEGUARDS 
EXIST TO DETERMINE THAT 
CONSERVATIVE CONTENT IS TREATED 
FAIRLY? 
>> I AM NOT SURE SPECIFICALLY 
WHAT THAT PERSON WAS REFERRING 
TO BUT I CAN WALK YOU THROUGH 
WHAT THE ALGORITHM CHANGE WAS 
IF THAT IS USEFUL. 
>> MAYBE I WILL GO ON TO MAIL 
THE QUESTIONS. 
THERE IS AN ISSUE OF CONTENT 
DISCRIMINATION. 
IT IS NOT A PROBLEM UNIQUE TO 
FACEBOOK BUT A NUMBER OF HIGH 
PROFILE PROFILERS ENGAGED IN 
BLOCKING AND CENSORING 
RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVE CONTENT. 
FCC CHAIRMAN PYE EVEN SAID THAT 
THEY ARE ROUTINELY BLOCKED OR 
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST CONTENT 
THEY DON'T LIKE. 
HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO SUCH 
AN ALLEGATION AND WHAT IS 
FACEBOOK DOING TO ASSURE THAT 
ITS USERS ARE BEING TREATED 
FAIRLY AND OBJECTIVELY BY 
CONTENT BUREAUS? 
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, THE PRINCIPAL 
PLATFORM FOR ALL IDEAS IS 
SOMETHING I CARE VERY DEEPLY 
ABOUT. 
I AM WORRIED ABOUT BIAS. AND WE 
TAKE A NUMBER OF STEPS TO MAKE 
SURE THAT NONE OF THE CHANGES 
WE MAKE ARE TARGETED IN ANY 
KIND OF BIASED WAY. 
AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW 
UP WITH YOU AND GO INTO MORE 
DETAIL ON THAT BECAUSE I AGREE 
THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE. 
>> OVER EASTER, THE CATHOLIC 
UNIVERSITY'S AD WITH A PICTURE 
OF THE HISTORIC CROSS REJECTED 
BY FACEBOOK. 
FACEBOOK ADDRESSED THE AIR 
WITHIN DAYS BUT THAT IT 
HAPPENED AT ALL IS DEEPLY 
DISTURBING. 
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT WAS 
SHOCKING, SENSATIONAL OR 
EXCESSIVELY VIOLENT ABOUT THE 
AD THAT CAUSED IT TO BE 
INITIALLY CENSORED GIVEN THAT 
YOUR COMPANY DID NOT SAY THAT 
IT VIOLATED TERMS OF SERVICE. 
HOW CAN VIEWERS KNOW THEIR 
CONTENT IS BEING VIEWED AND 
JUDGED ACCORDINGLY TO 
STANDARDS? 
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, IT SOUNDS 
LIKE WE MADE A MISTAKE, THERE. 
I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. 
WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEMS WE 
HAVE IN PLACE TO REVIEW, WE 
MAKE A RELATIVELY SMALL % OF 
THE STAKES IN CONTENT REVIEW 
BUT THAT CAN BE TOO MANY. 
AND THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE 
NEED TO IMPROVE. 
WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT I 
WOULDN'T EXTRAPOLATE FROM A FEW 
EXAMPLES TO ASSUMING THAT THE 
OVERALL SYSTEM IS BIASED. 
I GET HOW PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT 
AND DRAW THAT CONCLUSION THAT I 
DON'T THINK THAT REFLECTS THE 
WAY THAT WE WERE TRYING TO 
BUILD THE SYSTEM OR WHAT WE 
HAVE SEEN. 
>> THANK YOU. 
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE ON 
BUILDING TRUST. 
THAT IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT 
AS WE MOVE FORWARD. 
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES MR. 
BUTTERFIELD FROM NORTH 
CAROLINA. 
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN DAN 
THANK YOU MR. ZUCKERBERG FOR 
YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY. 
YOU HAVE STATED THAT YOUR GOAL 
WITH FACEBOOK IS TO BUILD 
STRONG COMMUNITIES AND 
CERTAINLY, THAT SOUNDS GOOD. 
YOU HAVE STATED HERE TODAY ON 
THE RECORD THAT YOU DID NOT 
LIVE UP TO THE PRIVACY 
EXPECTATIONS AND I APPRECIATE 
THAT. 
BUT THIS COMMITTEE -- AND YOU 
MUST KNOW THIS -- THIS 
COMMITTEE IS COUNTING ON YOU TO 
RIGHT A WRONG AND I HOPE YOU 
GET IT. 
IN MY OPINION, FACEBOOK IS HERE 
TO STAY. 
AND SO YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION 
TO PROTECT THE DATA THAT YOU 
COLLECT AND THE DATA THAT YOU 
USE AND CONGRESS HAS THE POWER 
TO REGULATE YOUR INDUSTRY AND 
WE HAVE THE POWER TO PENALIZE 
MISCONDUCT. 
BUT I WANT TO GO IN A DIFFERENT 
DIRECTION TODAY, SIR. 
YOU AND YOUR TEAM CERTAINLY 
KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT RACIAL 
DIVERSITY IN CORPORATE AMERICA 
AND SAMBERG AND I TALK ABOUT 
THAT ALL THE TIME. 
LET ME ASK YOU THIS AND THE 
CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS HAS 
BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON HOLDING 
YOUR INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABLE, NOT 
JUST FACEBOOK BUT YOUR INDUSTRY 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR INCREASING 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN INCLUSION AT 
ALL LEVELS OF THE INDUSTRY. 
AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A 
NUMBER OF DIVERSITY ISSUES. 
IN 2017, YOU INCREASED YOUR 
BLACK REPRESENTATION FROM 2% TO 
THREE TO PRESENT. 
-- TO 3%. 
THAT IS BETTER THAN NONE. 
THIS DOES NOT MEET THE 
DEFINITION OF BUILDING A 
RACIALLY DIVERSE COMMUNITY. 
CEO LEADERSHIP AND I FOUND THIS 
TO BE ABSOLUTELY TRUE, CEO 
LEADERSHIP ON DIVERSITY IS THE 
ONLY WAY THAT THE TECHNOLOGY 
INDUSTRY WILL CHANGE. 
SO, WILL YOU COMMIT, SERVE TO 
CONVENE, PERSONALLY CONVENE A 
MEETING OF THE CEOS IN YOUR 
SECTORS? MANY OF THEM ARE ALL 
OF THEM, PERHAPS, ARE YOUR 
FRIENDS, AND TO DO THIS VERY 
QUICKLY TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY 
TO INCREASE RACIAL DIVERSITY IN 
THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY? 
>> I THINK THAT IS A GOOD IDEA 
AND WE SHOULD FOLLOW UP ON IT. 
FROM THE CONVERSATIONS I HAVE 
HAD FOR MY FELLOW LEADERS IN 
THE TECH INDUSTRY, I KNOW THIS 
IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL 
UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE INDUSTRY 
IS BEHIND AND FACE BOOK -- AND 
FACEBOOK IS CERTAINLY A PART OF 
IT. 
WE KNOW THAT HAVING DIFFERENT 
VIEWPOINTS IS SOMETHING THAT 
WILL HELP US SERVE OUR 
COMMUNITY BETTER. 
THIS IS SOMETHING WE ARE HERE 
TO DO. 
I THINK THE WHOLE INDUSTRY IS 
BEHIND US ON THIS. 
>> THERE HAS BEEN MARGINAL 
IMPROVEMENT BUT WE MUST DO 
BETTER THAN WE HAVE DONE 
RECENTLY. 
YOU APPOINTED AN AFRICAN-
AMERICAN TO YOUR BOARD. 
AND ALSO A FRIEND. 
BUT WE HAVE TO CONCENTRATE MORE 
ON BOARD MEMBERSHIP FOR AFRICAN-
AMERICANS AND ALSO MINORITIES 
AT THE ENTRY-LEVEL WITHIN YOUR 
COUNTRY -- WITHIN YOUR COMPANY. 
I WAS LOOKING AT YOUR WEBSITE A 
FEW MINUTES AGO AND IT LOOKS 
LIKE YOU LIST FIVE INDIVIDUALS 
AS LEADERSHIP IN YOUR COMPANY 
BUT NONE OF THEM ARE AFRICAN-
AMERICAN. 
NOT ONLY YOU AND CHERYL BUT 
DAVID, MIKE AND CHRIS. 
THAT IS YOUR LEADERSHIP TEAM 
AND THIS DOES NOT REFLECT 
AMERICA. 
CAN YOU IMPROVE THE NUMBERS ON 
YOUR LEADERSHIP TEAM TO BE MORE 
DIVERSE?    
>>  CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS AN 
ISSUE THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON.  
WE HAVE A BROADER LEADERSHIP 
THAN JUST FIVE PEOPLE. 
>> IT IS NOT ON YOUR WEBSITE.   
>>  I UNDERSTAND THAT. 
>> WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT, 
MR. ZUCKERBERG. 
DO YOU PLAN TO ADD AN AFRICAN-
AMERICAN TO YOUR LEADERSHIP 
TEAM IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE 
AND WILL YOU COMMIT TO CONTINUE 
TO WORK WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL 
BLACK CAUCUS TO INCREASE 
DIVERSITY WITHIN YOUR COMPANY  
THAT YOU ARE SO PROUD OF? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, WE WILL 
CERTAINLY WORK WITH YOU. 
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. 
>> WE ALSO FIND THAT COMPANIES 
FAIL TO RETAIN BLACK EMPLOYEES 
CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR LOW 
PRESENCE IN TECHNOLOGY 
COMPANIES AND THERE IS LITTLE 
ú 
NUMBERS SO WILL YOU COMMIT TO 
PROVIDING NUMBERS ON YOUR 
RETENTION -- THAT IS THE BIG 
WORD, RETENTION OF YOUR 
EMPLOYEES DISAGGREGATED BY RACE 
AND YOUR DIVERSITY UPDATE 
STARTING THIS YEAR? 
CAN WE GET THAT DATA? 
THAT IS THE STARTING POINT. 
>> CONGRESSMAN, WE TRY TO 
INCLUDE A LOT OF IMPORTANT 
INFORMATION IN THE DIVERSITY 
UPDATE. 
I WILL GO AND DISCUSS THAT WITH 
MY TEAM AFTER I GET BACK. 
>> I AM OUT OF TIME, SIR. 
I WILL TAKE THIS UP WITH YOUR 
TEAM IN ANOTHER SETTING. 
WE WILL BE OUT THERE IN A FEW 
MINUTES. 
THANK YOU. 
>> YOUR TIME IS EXPIRED. 
THE GENTLEMAN FROM MISSISSIPPI, 
MR. HARPER. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
THANK YOU MR. ZUCKERBERG FOR 
BEING HERE AND WE DON'T LOSE 
SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT YOU ARE 
A GREAT AMERICAN SUCCESS STORY. 
IT IS A PART OF EVERYONE'S LIFE 
AND BUSINESS. 
SOMETIMES, MAYBE TOO OFTEN. 
BUT I THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE 
TIME TO BE HERE. 
AND OUR CONCERN IS TO MAKE SURE 
THAT IT IS FAIR. 
WE WORRY BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING 
AT POSSIBLE GOVERNMENT 
REGULATION, HERE. 
CERTAINLY, THE SELF-GOVERNING 
WHICH HAS HAD A LOT OF ISSUES 
AND HOW YOU FACTOR THAT AND WE 
ARE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE 
ALGORITHM CHANGES ON HOW YOU 
DETERMINE THE PRIORITIZATION OF 
THE NEWSFEEDS AND YOU LOOK AT, 
IT NEEDS TO BE TRUSTWORTHY AND 
RELIABLE AND RELEVANT. 
WELL, WHO IS GOING TO DETERMINE 
THAT? 
IT ALSO HAS AN IMPACT. 
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU SAY YOU 
DON'T WANT THE BIAS, IT IS 
DEPENDENT UPON SOMEONE SETTING 
WHAT THOSE STANDARDS ARE IN 
THAT. 
AND I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE 
OF QUESTIONS, IF I MAY. 
AND THIS IS A QUOTE FROM PAUL. 
FACEBOOK AND BP GENERAL 
COUNSEL, LIKE ALL ADD 
DEVELOPERS, MR. ALEKSANDR KOGAN 
REQUESTED AND GAINED ACCESS TO 
INFORMATION ON PEOPLE AFTER 
THEY CHOSE TO DOWNLOAD HIS APP. 
UNDER FACEBOOK POLICY, IF 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA HAD 
DEVELOPED THE "THIS IS YOUR 
DIGITAL LIFE" APP, THEY WOULD 
HAVE HAD ACCESS TO THE SAME 
DATA PURCHASED BY MR. COGAN, IS 
THAT CORRECT? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, THAT IS 
CORRECT. 
A DIFFERENT DEVELOPER COULD 
HAVE BUILT THAT. 
>> ACCORDING TO POLITICO 
FACT.COM AND THIS IS A QUOTE 
"THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN AND 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA BOTH GAINED 
ACCESS TO HUGE AMOUNTS OF 
INFORMATION ON -- ABOUT 
FACEBOOK USERS AND THEIR 
FRIENDS AND IN NEITHER CASE DID 
THE PRINCE OR APP USERS 
CONSENT." 
THIS DATA THAT CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA REQUIRED WAS USED TO 
TARGET VOTERS WITH POLITICAL ADS
MUCH USED BY THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN 
IN 2012, WOULD THAT BE CORRECT? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, THE BIG 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO 
CASES IS THAT THE COGAN CASE, 
PEOPLE SIGNED INTO THAT APP, 
EXPECTING TO SHARE THE DATA 
WITH COGAN AND HE TURNED AROUND 
IN VIOLATION OF OUR POLICIES 
AND AND VIOLATIONS OF PEOPLE'S 
EXPECTATIONS AND FOLDED TO A 
THIRD-PARTY FIRM, CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA, IN THIS CASE. 
I THINK WE WERE VERY CLEAR 
ABOUT HOW THE FORM WORKED AT 
THE TIME AND THAT ANYONE COULD 
SIGN INTO THE APP. 
AND THEY COULD BRING IN THEIR 
INFORMATION, IF THEY WANTED AND 
SOME INFORMATION FROM THEIR 
FRIENDS. 
PEOPLE HAD CONTROL OVER THAT 
AND IF YOU WANTED, YOU COULD 
TURN OFF THE ABILITY TO SIGN 
INTO IT OR TURN OFF THE ABILITY 
FOR YOUR FRIENDS TO BRING IN 
INFORMATION. 
THE PLATFORM WORKED THE WAY WE 
DECIDED AT THE TIME. 
WE NOW KNOW THAT WE SHOULD HAVE 
A MORE RESTRICTIVE FORM WHERE 
PEOPLE CAN NOT ONLY BRING IN 
INFORMATION FROM THEIR FRIENDS 
BUT THEIR OWN INFORMATION BUT 
THAT IS THE WAY THE SYSTEM 
WORKED. 
>> WEATHER IN VIOLATION OF THE 
AGREEMENT OR NOT, YOU AGREE 
THAT THE USER HAS AN 
EXPECTATION THAT THEIR 
INFORMATION WOULD BE PROTECTED 
AND REMAIN PRIVATE AND NOT BE 
SOLD SO THAT IS SOMETHING AND 
THE REASON WE ARE HERE TODAY. 
AND I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND 
THE GENERAL PUBLIC'S OUTRAGE 
AND THEIR CONCERN REGARDING THE 
WAY CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 
REQUIRED THEIR INFORMATION BUT 
IF PEOPLE ARE OUTRAGED BECAUSE 
THEY USED THAT FOR POLITICAL 
REASONS, WOULD THAT BE 
HYPOCRITICAL? 
SHOULDN'T THEY BE EQUALLY 
OUTRAGED THAT THE OBAMA 
CAMPAIGN USES FACEBOOK DATA 
WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT IN 2012?  
>>  CONGRESSMAN,  WHAT I THINK 
PEOPLE ARE RIGHTFULLY VERY 
UPSET ABOUT IS THAT AN APP 
DEVELOPER THAT PEOPLE SHARE 
DATA WITH SOLD IT TO SOMEONE 
ELSE AND FRANKLY, WE DIDN'T DO 
ENOUGH TO PREVENT THAT OR 
UNDERSTAND IT, SOON ENOUGH. 
AND NOW, WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH 
AND PUT INTO PLACE SYSTEMS TO 
PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING 
AGAIN AND MAKING SURE THAT WE 
HAVE SUFFICIENT CONTROLS IN 
PLACE IN OUR ECOSYSTEM SO THAT 
DEVELOPERS CANNOT ABUSE 
PEOPLE'S DATA. 
>> THANK YOU. 
MY TIME IS EXPIRED. 
>> THE GENTLEMAN FROM 
CALIFORNIA.    
>>  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN AND 
WELCOME MR. ZUCKERBERG.  
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, HERE. 
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING ABOUT 
FACEBOOK AND HOW YOU DEVELOPED 
YOUR PLATFORM, A SOCIAL 
PLATFORM AMONGST FRIENDS AND 
COLLEAGUES AND JOINING A 
COMMUNITY. 
AND A LOT OF THAT WAS BASED 
UPON TRUST. 
THAT EVOLVED INTO THIS BUSINESS 
PLATFORM AND ONE OF THE PILLARS 
STILL WAS TRUST. 
AND I THINK EVERYONE HERE WOULD 
AGREE THAT TRUST IS IN SHORT 
SUPPLY HERE AND THAT IS WHY WE 
ARE HERE TODAY. 
YOU HAVE CONSTANTLY MAINTAINED 
THAT CONSUMERS OWN THE DATA 
THEY APPLY TO FACEBOOK AND 
SHOULD HAVE CONTROL OVER IT. 
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT 
MEANS. 
TO ME, YOU WANT TO HAVE A SAY 
ABOUT HOW AND WHEN IT IS USED. 
I DON'T JUST MEAN PICTURES, 
EMAIL ADDRESSES, FACEBOOK GROUPS
OR PAGES. 
I UNDERSTAND THE INFORMATION 
PROVIDED TO FACEBOOK CAN BE 
USED BY ALGORITHMS TO FORM 
ASSUMPTIONS. NOW, DO YOU 
BELIEVE THAT CONSUMERS ACTUALLY 
OWN THEIR DATA EVEN WHEN THAT 
DATA HAS BEEN SUPPLEMENTED BY A 
DATA BROKER, ASSUMPTIONS 
ALGORITHMS HAVE MADE ABOUT THE 
USER OR OTHERWISE AND THIS IS 
KIND OF THE QUESTION THAT MS. 
BLACKBURN HAS COME UP WITH OUR 
OWN COMPREHENSIVE PROFILE WHICH 
IS KIND OF OUR VIRTUAL SELF? 
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, I BELIEVE 
THAT PEOPLE OWN THEIR OWN 
CONTENT. 
WHERE THIS GETS COMPLICATED -- 
LET'S SAY I TAKE A PHOTO AND I 
SHARED WITH YOU. 
IS THAT MY PHOTO OR IS IT YOUR 
PHOTO? 
I WOULD TAKE THE POSITION THAT 
IT IS OUR PHOTO IN THAT I CAN 
BRING THAT PHOTO TO ANOTHER APP 
IF I WANT BUT YOU CAN'T. 
>> ONCE IT GOES TO THE DATA 
BROKER, THOUGH. 
THERE ARE CERTAIN ALGORITHMS 
AND CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS. 
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT?    
>>  I'M SORRY. 
CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT? 
>> WHAT I MEAN  IS, IF YOU 
SUPPLEMENT THIS DATA -- YOU SAY 
YOU OWN IT BUT YOU SUPPLEMENT 
THIS DATA AND OTHER DATA 
BROKERS USE THEIR OWN 
ALGORITHMS TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS. 
THEN, WHAT HAPPENS THERE? 
TO ME, SOMEONE ELSE HAS TAKEN 
IT OVER. 
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT WE OWN 
THAT DATA? 
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, ALL OF THE 
DATA THAT YOU PUT IN AND ALL OF 
THE CONTENT THAT YOU PUT ON 
FACEBOOK IS YOURS. 
YOU CAN REMOVE IT AT ANY TIME. 
YOU CAN GET RID OF YOUR ACCOUNT 
AND GET RID OF IT ALL AT ONCE. 
>> YOU CANNOT GET IT BACK ONCE 
IT IS OUT THERE, WRITES? 
THAT'S REALLY -- WE MIGHT OWN 
OUR OWN DATA BUT ONCE IT IS 
USED AND IN ADVERTISING, WE 
LOSE CONTROL OVER IT. IS THAT 
NOT RIGHT?
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, I WOULD 
DISAGREE. 
WE DON'T SELL DATA TO 
ADVERTISERS. 
ADVERTISERS DON'T GET ACCESS TO 
YOUR DATA. 
THERE IS A CORE 
MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW THAT 
SYSTEM WORKS. 
IF YOU ARE A SHOP AND YOU ARE 
SELLING MUFFINS, YOU MIGHT WANT 
TO TARGET PEOPLE IN A SPECIFIC 
TOWN WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN 
BAKING OR SOME DEMOGRAPHIC. 
BUT WE DON'T SEND THAT 
INFORMATION TO YOU. 
WE JUST SHOW THE MESSAGE TO THE 
RIGHT PEOPLE AND THAT IS A 
REALLY IMPORTANT 
MISUNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE 
SYSTEM WORKS. 
>> FACEBOOK IS BASING -- AT 
LEAST ON THE DATA -- THE MORE 
COLLECTED, ALLOWING BETTER 
TARGETS ABUSES OR CLASSES OF 
USERS SO EVEN IF FACEBOOK 
DOESN'T EARN MONEY FROM SELLING 
DATA, DOESN'T FACEBOOK EARN 
MONEY FROM ADVERTISING BASED ON 
THAT DATA?>>YES CONGRESSWOMAN, 
WE RUN ADS. 
THAT'S THE BUSINESS MODEL, 
RUNNING ADS. 
AND WE USE THE DATA THAT PEOPLE 
PUT INTO THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO 
MAKE THE ADS MORE RELEVANT 
WHICH ALSO MAKES THEM MORE 
VALUABLE BUT WHAT WE HEAR FROM 
PEOPLE IS THAT THEY WILL SEE 
THE ADS AND THEY WANT THEM TO 
BE GOOD AND RELEVANT. 
>> BUT WE ARE NOT CONTROLLING 
THAT DATA? 
>> NO, YOU HAVE COMPLETE 
CONTROL OVER THAT! 
>> AS PREVIOUSLY AGREED, WE 
WILL TAKE A FIVE MINUTE RECESS 
AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND A 
WITNESS NEEDS TO PLAN TO BE 
BACK IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. 
WE STAND IN RECESS. 
>>  YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
MARK SUCKER BERG . DAY #2 OF HIS
-- FIRST IMPRESSIONS -- MARK 
ZUCKERBERG, DAY #2 OF HIS 
TESTIMONY. 
>> IF NOT MORE TECHNOLOGICAL 
SAVVY, WE CERTAINLY GOT A MORE 
DIVERSE GROUP OF QUESTIONS AND 
TOUGHER THAN YESTERDAY. 
>> JENNA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?    
>>  LESS FILIBUSTERING . MARK 
ZUCKERBERG WAS STEERING THE 
CONVERSATION MORE, YESTERDAY.   
>>  I CAN TELL YOU THAT HE IS 
SMILING A LOT LESS  TODAY. HE 
SOUNDS A LITTLE MORE PANSEAR 
TODAY. 
LIKE THE QUESTIONS ARE FINALLY 
GETTING UNDER HIS SKIN. 
>> THIS QUESTION ABOUT DATA AND 
OWNERSHIP, I DON'T THINK THEY 
GOT DEEP INTO IT, AND THE 
SENATE. 
HE KEEPS SAYING THAT WE OWN OUR 
OWN DATA AND THAT WE DON'T SELL 
DATA. 
YEAH, BUT YOU RENTED, SORT OF. 
>> HE ALSO SAID THAT YOU HAVE 
COMPLETE CONTROL OF IT. 
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY IF WE 
HAD COMPLETE CONTROL OF IT. 
IT IS A QUESTIO OF THE APIS. 
HE HAS HAD TOO MUCH TIME ABOUT 
HOW YOU CAN CONTROL EXACTLY 
WHAT YOU POST. 
IT IS DATA ALLOWED OUT OF THE 
COMPANY INTO THE HANDS OF THE 
DEVELOPERS AND IT WAS PASSED 
ON. 
>> THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE POINT. 
WE ARE FOCUSED ON CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA AND THE OTHER BAD 
ACTORS BUT THE DEVELOPER 
PLATFORM WILL -- WAS DESIGNED 
TO ALLOW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
DEVELOPERS TO HAVE ACCESS TO A 
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF YOUR 
PROFILE DATA. 
ONCE THAT IS EXTRACTED AND PUT 
ON ANY OTHER SERVER, THERE IS 
NO CONTROL OVER WHO HAS THAT 
AND THE SOPHISTICATION OF THE 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THAT.    
>>  YOU SAW THE QUESTIONS 
YESTERDAY . TRYING TO GET 
BEHIND HOW THIS IS HANDLED IN A 
THIRD-PARTY PERSPECTIVE. 
IT DOESN'T REALLY ANSWER THAT.  
>>  AND FELT ALSO, AT SOME 
POINT,  MUCH LIKE THE SENATE 
WAS SORT OF SERIOUS EVEN THOUGH 
THERE WAS SOME QUESTION THAT 
THE SENATORS UNDERSTAND EXACTLY 
THE MODEL OF THE FACEBOOK 
BUSINESS MODEL. 
POLITICS SORT OF SEEP INTO THIS.
YOU HAD A COUPLE OF PEOPLE 
SUGGESTING THAT DIAMOND AND 
SILK --    
>>  WE HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH FROM 
THEM .    
>>  THAT THEY ARE  -- THAT 
THEIR ACTIVITY ON FACEBOOK WAS 
REMOVED BECAUSE OF WHATEVER 
CONTENT THESE FOLKS WHO MANAGE, 
THAT YOU SEE ON FACEBOOK AND 
THERE IS SOME SUGGESTION THAT 
THEY WERE CONSERVATIVE. 
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT? 
>> DEFINITELY A LITTLE BIT OF 
GRANDSTANDING. 
THAT'S WHY THE TOPICS SEEM TO 
BE FAIRLY WIDE. 
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT 
DISCRIMINATION, A TOPIC ABOUT 
DIVERSITY IN THE WORKFORCE. 
BUT THE COMPLETE IS FAR FROM 
WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE 
TALKING ABOUT TODAY. 
>> I THINK WE WERE ALL 
SURPRISED WHEN MARK ZUCKERBERG 
WAS ASKED ABOUT MULTIMILLIONS 
OF DOLLARS AND HE COULD NOT 
TALK ABOUT THOSE SETTLEMENTS. 
THAT WAS SHOCKING TO ME. 
>> HIS EYES ARE NOT ON THE 
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. 
HE IS LOOKING AHEAD INTO HOW HE 
IS GOING TO GROW FACEBOOK. 
I THINK HE NEEDS TO TAKE A LOOK 
AT SOME OF THE RISKS IN HIS 
PLATFORM AND OBVIOUSLY PAY MORE 
ATTENTION TO THAT. 
>> DO YOU THINK THAT IS WHY WE 
ARE HERE NOW? 
HE HAS BEEN SAYING THAT IN HIS 
APOLOGIES. 
WE DROPPED THE BALL, BLAH BLAH 
BLAH. 
AND OKAY. 
IT WAS SORT OF HARD TO BELIEVE 
BUT NOW, HE COULDN'T TALK ABOUT 
THE DETAILS OF SETTLEMENT, NOT 
THE FTC AGREEMENT IN 2011! WHAT 
IS THAT?! 
>> GOING BACK TO ONE THING THAT 
JENNA SAID A FEW TIMES, IT IS 
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT, SAFETY. 
AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 
MR. ZUCKERBERG TO DEFEND 
HIMSELF AND DEFEND HIS COMPANY 
BUT WE HAD NOT HEARD HIM 
EMPATHIZE WITH HUMANS. 
FACEBOOK IS COMPOSED OF 200 
BILLION USERS, AS THEY LIKE TO 
SAY. 
USERS ARE STATS, ALL ARE HUMANS 
AND ALL OF THOSE HUMANS HAVE 
FOLDER ABILITIES THAT EACH ONE 
OF US CAN RELATE TO AND WHAT HE 
IS NOT DOING IS EMPATHIZING 
WITH THE HUMANS ON FACEBOOK. 
>> AND HE SAID YESTERDAY, I USE 
IT. MY FAMILY USES IT. 
BUT HE HAS SPECIAL PRIVILEGES 
THE NOTION ON THE PLATFORM. 
AND ONLY BECAUSE OF THE CHECK 
RON ARE WE GOING TO GET THAT 
OPTION. 
I THINK ONE OF THEM HAD REALLY 
NAILED IT AND SAID PRIVACY BY 
PRESS RELEASE. 
SO I REALLY HAVE TO GIVE A NOD 
TO THE TECH JOURNALISTS OUT 
THERE WHO HAVE BEEN DRIVING 
FORWARD AND DOING THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS EVEN STARTING 
WITH THE GUARDIAN OVERSEAS WHO 
LAUNCHED CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA. 
RIGHT? 
PRIVACY BY PRESS RELEASE. 
FACEBOOK IS ACTIVELY MANAGING 
THEIR PRODUCT. 
THEY ARE WAITING UNTIL THERE IS 
A PRESS BLOWBACK AND A SCANDAL 
AND THEN, THEY REACT. 
>> IT IS ALL ABOUT GROWTH, 
FACEBOOK. 
THAT WHOLE PHILOSOPHY IS 
CORDLESS. 
-- CORDLESS. 
>> HE TALKS ABOUT THE MISSION 
AND BRINGING THINGS TOGETHER 
BUT WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE, 
FACEBOOK ADS. 
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THEY DO AND 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN A 
LOT OF DISCUSSION AROUND THAT 
AS MUCH BECAUSE HE HAS DONE 
SUCH A GOOD JOB AND FACEBOOK IS 
SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF 
EVERYONE'S LIFE THAT WE KIND OF 
THINK OF IT THAT WAY. 
WE ALL LIVE IN THIS BIG AND 
HAPPY COMMUNITY CALLED 
FACEBOOK. 
WHEN FIRST -- WHEN PUSH COMES 
TO SHOVE, WE DO ACTUALLY SELL 
IT.    
>>  WRITES.  
BUT THAT IS PART OF THE 
STRATEGY. 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE ARE 
SEEING HIM IN A SUIT AND A LONG 
TIME. 
BUT THIS IS ABOUT CONNECTING 
PEOPLE. 
PLEASE DON'T LOOK BEHIND THIS 
CURTAIN, RIGHT? 
BUT I THINK WHAT WE ARE SEEING 
HERE IS THE SORT OF VENEER 
FALLING APART, A LITTLE. 
AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY 
GOOD POINT CREDITING THE 
JOURNALISTS AND THE LAWMAKERS. 
I THINK A LOT OF USERS ARE 
STILL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE 
CONCEPT THAT THIS IS A PLATFORM 
MEANT JUST TO CONNECT PEOPLE 
AND THAT IS ALL THAT IS SO 
THERE IS A PRICE TO PAY FOR IT, 
A LITTLE BIT OF DATA. 
WHAT IS DATA?    
>>  IT IS IN AGGREGATE, THAT IS 
WHAT WE ARE EXPECTING AND I 
HAVE TO SAY POST U.S. 
SELECTION, I THINK THERE IS A 
GENERAL SENSE  FROM END-USERS 
THAT THEY UNDERSTAND SOMETHING 
AS WELL. 
I THINK THAT HAS CHANGED AND I 
DO THINK THAT IS ONE REASON WE 
ARE HERE AND THAT WE HAVE 
TESTIMONY HAPPENING AND I AM 
NOT GOING TO JOIN THOSE OUT 
THERE RIGHT NOW SAYING THAT THE 
LAWMAKERS ARE -- THEY DON'T 
UNDERSTAND THE TECHNOLOGY. 
I THINK THEY DO HAVE A BIT MORE 
OF A CLUE AND THEY ARE ELECTED 
OFFICIAL SO WE NEED TO EDUCATE 
THEM AND HOPE THAT THEY CAN 
REALLY PUSH FORWARD ON THIS. 
>> I WOULD ARGUE THAT AMORY IS 
A HEAVY USER OF FACEBOOK. 
>> I PLEAD THE FIFTH. 
>> YEAH AND THAT'S A GREAT 
POINT. 
THIS COVERAGE IS GOING TO BE A 
LOT ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ARE 
RECTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND 
ELSEWHERE. 
AND PEOPLE WERE REACTING 
YESTERDAY, LESS SO TODAY BUT 
THE POINT IS WELL TAKEN AND YOU 
MADE THE POINT EARLIER THAT 
THESE ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO 
REPRESENT US AND USE FACEBOOK. 
THERE WAS ONE POINT MADE I 
THINK WHEN THEY WELCOMED MR. 
ZUCKERBERG TO THE TABLE AND HE 
SAID, WE RECOGNIZE HOW YOUR 
COMPANY IS A GREAT AMERICAN 
STORY BECAUSE IT IS SUCH AN 
INTEGRAL PART OF OUR LIVES. 
LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 
ROGER, DAN PATTERSON. 
WE WILL COME BACK AND CONTINUE 
TO FOLLOW UP. 
BIG NEWS. PAUL RYAN IS NOT 
RUNNING FOR REELECTION. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP THREATENING 
SYRIA WITH MISSILES ON TWITTER. 
STAY WITH US. 
>>> SURPRISE! 
>>  
>>  IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE BUT I 
HAVE A  -- I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER 
OF CONGRESS. MY KIDS WERE NOT 
EVEN BORN WHEN I WAS FIRST 
ELECTED. 
OUR OLDEST BECAME 13 WHEN I 
BECAME SPEAKER. 
NOW, ALL THREE OF OUR KIDS ARE 
TEENAGERS. 
WHAT I REALIZE IS, IF I AM HERE 
FOR ONE MORE TERM, MY KIDS WILL 
ONLY HAVE EVER KNOWN ME AS A 
WEEKEND DAD. 
I JUST CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. 
I WILL BE SETTING NEW PRIORITIES
IN MY LIFE AND I AM INCREDIBLY 
PROUD OF WHAT WE HAVE 
ACCOMPLISHED. 
I DON'T WANT TO BE ONE OF THOSE 
PEOPLE LOOKING BACK ON MY LIFE 
THINKING I SPENT THOSE THEY 
WILL ONLY KNOW ME AS A WEEKEND 
FATHER.    
>>  THAT IS PAUL RYAN SPEAKING 
EARLIER. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU BACK  
TO THE HOUSE COMMERCE COMMITTEE 
WHERE MARK ZUCKERBERG IS 
TESTIFYING FOR A SECOND DAY ON 
CAPITOL HILL.    
>>  WE WILL REVIEW IT AND GET 
BACK TO YOU.     
>>  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
SHALL SEND LORD APPEARED  ON 
THE TODAY PROGRAM LAST WEEK AND 
ADMITTED THAT ADDITIONAL 
BREACHES AND INFORMATION COULD 
BE DISCOVERED BY THE CURRENT 
AUDITS. 
"WE ARE DOING AN INVESTIGATION 
AND WE ARE GOING TO DO THE 
AUDITS AND WE DO THINK IT IS 
POSSIBLE, THAT'S WHY WE ARE 
DOING THE AUDITS." 
AND THEN, THE CEO -- THE COO 
WENT ON TO SAY THAT FACEBOOK 
CARED ABOUT THE PROPHECY, ALL 
ALONG. 
THAT I THINK WE GOT THE BALANCE 
LONG. 
DO YOU AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT 
OF YOUR COO?    
>>  YES, CONGRESSMAN, I DO. 
WE WERE TRYING TO BALANCE TWO 
EQUITIES.  
ON THE ONE HAND, MAKING IT SO 
THAT PEOPLE HAD DATA PORTABILITY
, THE ABILITY TO BRING THEIR 
DATA TO ANOTHER APP IN ORDER TO 
HAVE NEW EXPERIENCES WHICH I 
THINK IS A VALUE THAT WE ALL 
CARE ABOUT. 
ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ALSO NEED 
TO BALANCE MAKING SURE THAT 
EVERYONE'S INFORMATION IS 
PROTECTED. 
AND I THINK WE DIDN'T GET THAT 
BALANCE RIGHT UP FRONT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
I CERTAINLY CONCUR WITH THE 
STATEMENT OF THE COO AS 
AFFIRMED BY YOU TODAY THAT YOU 
HAVE THE BALANCE WRONG. 
AND REGARDING CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA, THE FACT THAT 300,000
INDIVIDUALS OR SO GAVE CONSENT 
BUT THAT CERTAINLY DOES NOT 
INDICATE THEY GAVE CONSENT TO 
MILLIONS. 
-- IS BACK WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT 
DID. 
BUT REGARDLESS, WE TAKE A 
BROADER VIEW OF WHATEVER 
RESPONSIBILITY IS OF PROTECTING 
PEOPLE'S PRIVACY. 
IF A DEVELOPER WHO PEOPLE GAVE 
THEIR INFORMATION TO, ALEKSANDR 
KOGAN, GOES IN VIOLATION OF HIS 
AGREEMENT WITH US AND SELLS THE 
DATA TO CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA, 
THAT IS A BIG ISSUE AND PEOPLE 
HAVE A RIGHT TO BE UPSET. 
I AM UPSET THAT THAT HAS 
HAPPENED AND WE NEED TO MAKE 
SURE WE PLACE SYSTEMS THAT THAT 
MAY NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. 
>> I AM SURE THAT WILL BE 
DETERMINED IN THE FUTURE. 
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> WE RECOGNIZE MS. CASTOR. 
>> WELCOME, MR. ZUCKERBERG. 
FOR ALL OF THE BENEFITS THAT 
FACEBOOK HAS RIGHTED IN 
BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND 
CONNECTING FAMILIES, I THINK A 
DEVIL'S BARGAIN HAS BEEN 
STRUCK. 
AND IN THE END, AMERICANS DO 
NOT LIKE TO BE MANIPULATED. 
THEY DO NOT LIKE TO BE SPIED 
ON. 
WE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN SOMEONE IS
OUTSIDE OF OUR HOME WATCHING. 
WE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN SOMEONE 
IS FOLLOWING US AROUND THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD OR FOLLOWING US 
FOR OUR CHILDREN. 
FACEBOOK NOW HAS EVOLVED TO A 
PLACE WHERE YOU ARE TRACKING 
EVERYONE. 
YOU ARE COLLECTING DATA ON JUST 
ABOUT EVERYBODY. 
YES, WE UNDERSTAND THE FACEBOOK 
USERS THAT PROACTIVELY SIGN IN 
OUR PART OF THAT PLATFORM BUT 
YOU ARE FOLLOWING FACEBOOK 
USERS EVEN AFTER THEY LOG OFF 
OF THAT PLATFORM AND 
APPLICATION. 
AS YOU ARE COLLECTING PERSONAL 
INFORMATION ON PEOPLE WHO DO 
NOT EVEN HAVE FACEBOOK 
ACCOUNTS, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?   
>>  CONGRESSWOMAN , I BELIEVE 
-- 
>> YES OR NO? 
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, I DON'T 
BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT WE ARE 
TRACKING. 
>> YOU ARE COLLECTING -- YOU 
HAVE ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 
YOU ARE DOING THAT FOR SECURITY 
PURPOSES AND COMMERCIAL 
PURPOSES. 
SO YOU ARE COLLECTING DATA WHEN 
SOMEONE GOES TO A WEBSITE AND 
IT HAS THE FACEBOOK LIKE OR 
SHARE, THAT DATA IS BEING 
COLLECTED BY FACEBOOK, 
CORRECT?>> CONGRESSWOMAN, THAT 
IS WRITES THAT WE UNDERSTAND IN 
ORDER TO SHOW WHICH OF YOUR 
FRIENDS LIKE THE PAGE. 
>> I DON'T THINK THE AVERAGE 
AMERICAN REALLY UNDERSTANDS 
THAT, TODAY. 
SOMETHING THAT FUNDAMENTAL. 
AND THAT YOU ARE TRACKING 
EVERYONE'S ONLINE ACTIVITIES. 
THEIR SEARCHES, YOU CAN TRACK 
WHAT PEOPLE BUY, CORRECT?>> 
CONGRESSWOMAN, -- 
>> -- YOU ARE COLLECTING THAT 
DATA OF WHAT PEOPLE PURCHASE?   
>>  ACTUALLY, IF THEY SHARED 
WITH US . 
>> IT HAS A SHARE BUTTON SO IT 
IS GATHERING INFORMATION. 
IN FACT, YOU HAVE PATENTED 
APPLICATIONS TO DO JUST THAT.   
>>  I DON'T THINK ANY OF THOSE 
BUTTONS SHARE TRANSACTION DATA. 
>> BUT THEY TRACK YOU . YOU ARE 
COLLECTING MEDICAL DATA FOR 
THOSE ON THE INTERNET. 
WHETHER THEY ARE FACEBOOK USERS 
OR NOT, RIGHT?    
>>  YES, WE COLLECT SOME DATA.  
>>  AND YOU ARE COLLECTING -- 
YOU WATCH WHERE WE GO?  
THE SENATOR HAD A BUNNY 
QUESTION ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE 
STAYING AND YOU DIDN'T WANT TO 
SHARE THAT BUT FACEBOOK ALSO 
SHARES DATA ABOUT WHERE WE 
TRAVEL, IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> EVERYONE HAS CONTROL OF THAT
. 
>> I WILL GET TO THAT BUT YES, 
THAT IS THE BUSINESS YOU ARE 
IN, GATHERING DATA AND 
AGGREGATING DATA? RIGHT? 
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, I DISAGREE 
WITH THAT CHARACTERIZATION. 
>> YOU ARE SAYING YOU DID NOT 
GATHER DATA BASED UPON THE 
INTERNET AND WAYS THAT THEY 
SIGN IN AND THINGS LIKE THAT?   
>>  PEOPLE CHOOSE TO SHARE DATA 
. 
>> THAT'S THE PRIMARY WAY BUT 
THE OTHER WAY THAT FACEBOOK 
GATHERS DATA IS THAT YOU BUY 
DATA FROM DATA BROKERS OUTSIDE 
OF THE PLATFORM, CORRECT? 
>> WE JUST ANNOUNCED TWO WEEKS 
AGO THAT WE WERE GOING TO STOP 
INTERACTING WITH DATA BROKERS 
AND EVEN THOUGH THAT IS AN 
INDUSTRY NORM TO MAKE IT SO 
THAT THE ADVERTISING CAN BE 
MORE RELEVANT.   
>>  SEE, IT IS PRACTICALLY 
IMPOSSIBLE THESE DAYS TO REMAIN 
UNTRACKED IN AMERICA. 
FOR ALL OF THE BENEFITS THAT 
FACEBOOK HAS BROUGHT TO THE 
INTERNET AND THAT IS NOT PART 
OF THE BARGAIN AND CURRENT LAWS 
HAVE NOT INVOLVED IN THE 
CURRENT LAWS HAVE NOT ADOPTED 
TO ADDRESS DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE 
AND CONGRESS SHOULD ACT. 
AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE 
CONTROLS, THE OPAQUE AGREEMENT, 
THE CONSENT AGREEMENT AND 
SETTINGS ARE AN ADEQUATE 
SUBSTITUTE FOR FUNDAMENTAL 
PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR 
CONSUMERS.>> TIME.    
>>  I TAKE BACK MY TIME. 
AND I WOULD LIKE TO ASK  
CONSTITUENTS CONSENT. 
>> NOT AN EXCEPTION.    
>>  THANKS FOR BEING HERE. 
WHEN I FIRST GOT INTO  PUBLIC 
OFFICE, A LOT OF PEOPLE 
COMPLAINED ABOUT ADS, THE 
INCONVENIENCE. I REMEMBER 
TELLING SOMEONE ONE TIME, 
THERE'S NOTHING I HATE WORSE 
THAN THE FOUR MINUTE TIMEOUT, 
THE TV TIMEOUT. 
BUT BECAUSE OF THE FOUR MINUTE 
TIMEOUT, I GET TO WATCH THE 
GAME FOR FREE SO THAT IS 
SOMETHING THAT I AM WILLING TO 
ACCEPT. 
IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO 
ACCEPT YOUR DATA OUT THERE AND 
IT IS BEING USED BUT IT IS 
BEING USED IN THE RIGHT WAY AND 
IT IS FUNNY BECAUSE I WAS GOING 
TO ASK THE QUESTION. 
I SEARCHED A TOWN IN FLORIDA 
AND I STARTED GETTING ADS FOR A 
BRAND OF HOTEL THAT I STOOD -- 
THAT I TYPICALLY STAY IN THAT I 
WAS WILLING TO PAY AND STAY 
THERE SO I THOUGHT IT WAS 
ACTUALLY CONVENIENT INSTEAD OF 
GETTING AN ADD TO A PLACE I 
NEVER GO, I GOT AN ADD TO A 
PLACE I WAS LOOKING TO GO AND I 
THOUGHT THAT WAS CONVENIENT. 
AND IT WAS ON FACEBOOK. 
I USED FACEBOOK TO MESSAGE MY 
MOTHER-IN-LAW THIS WEEKEND. 
IT IS VERY VALUABLE AND YOU GET 
TO DO THAT FOR FREE. 
YOUR BUSINESS MODEL RELIES ON 
DATA. 
BUT THEY USE CONSUMER DRIVEN 
DATA. 
YOU ARE YOU -- NOT UNIQUE IN 
DOING THIS TYPE OF TARGETED 
ADS, ARE YOU? 
>> NO, CONGRESSMAN, YOU ARE 
RIGHT. 
ADD BASED BUSINESS MODELS ARE A 
COMMON WAY THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN ABLE TO OFFER FREE 
SERVICES FOR A LONG TIME AND 
OUR SOCIAL MISSION OF TRYING TO 
HELP CONNECT EVERYONE IN THE 
WORLD RELIES ON HAVING A 
SERVICE THAT CAN BE AFFORDABLE 
TO EVERYONE AND THAT EVERYONE 
CAN USE AND THAT'S WHY THE 
BUSINESS MODELS ARE THE SERVICE 
MISSION THAT WE HAD AND I THINK 
SOMETIMES, THAT GETS LOST. 
BUT THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT 
POINT.   
>>  BUT WHAT I AM WATCHING , 
THE HILLTOP ON BASKETBALL, THE 
PERSON ADVERTISING, I AM JUST 
WATCHING THE AD SO THERE IS NO 
DATA OR AGREEMENT OR RISK BUT 
WITH YOU, THERE IS CONSUMER 
DRIVEN DATA. 
BUT IF WE WERE TO GREATLY 
REDUCE OR STOP OR GREATLY 
REDUCED THROUGH LEGISLATION THE 
CONSUMER DRIVEN DATA FOR 
TARGETING ADS, WHAT DO YOU 
THINK THAT WOULD DO TO THE 
INTERNET -- I'M NOT SAYING THE 
INTERNET BUT EVERYTHING 
FACEBOOK?   
>>  CONGRESSMAN, IT WOULD MAKE 
THE ADS LESS RELEVANT .    
>>  WHAT WOULD THAT DO? 
>> IT WOULD HAVE A NUMBER OF 
EFFECTS. 
FOR THOSE USING THE SERVICES, 
IT WOULD MAKE THE ADS LESS 
RELEVANT TO THEM. 
FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WHO USE 
ADVERTISING,  IT WOULD MAKE 
ADVERTISING MORE EXPENSIVE 
BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY 
MORE TO REACH MORE PEOPLE MORE 
EFFICIENTLY BECAUSE TARGETING 
HELPS SMALL BUSINESSES BE ABLE 
TO REACH PEOPLE AS EFFECTIVELY 
AS THE COMPANIES WHO TYPICALLY 
HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO DO FOR 
A LONG TIME. 
IT WOULD AFFECT OUR REVENUE, 
SOMEWHAT, AS WELL. 
AND I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE 
OF POINTS THAT ARE LOST. 
ONE IS THAT WE GIVE PEOPLE THE 
CONTROL TO NOT USE THE DATA AS 
IF THEY WANT. 
MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT. 
I THINK PART OF THE REASON FOR 
THAT IS THAT PEOPLE GET THAT 
THEY ARE GOING TO SEE ADS, THEY 
WANT THEM TO BE RELEVANT. 
BUT THE OTHER THING IS THAT A 
LOT OF WHAT OUR BUSINESS, WHAT 
MAKES THE ADS WORK OR WHAT 
MAKES THE BUSINESS GOOD IS THAT 
PEOPLE ARE VERY ENGAGED WITH 
FACEBOOK. 
WE HAVE MORE THAN 1 BILLION OF 
PEOPLE WHO SPEND ALMOST AN HOUR 
A DAY ON OUR SERVICES. 
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. 
THIS JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR ME 
SO I WANTED TO LET THE 
CONGRESSMAN KNOW, YOU CAN HIT 
DELETE. 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I SAY, 
FACEBOOK, TAKE MY DATA OFF YOUR 
PLATFORM? 
>> IF YOU DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT, 
WE IMMEDIATELY MAKE IT SO THAT 
YOUR ACCOUNT IS NO LONGER 
AVAILABLE ONCE YOU ARE DONE 
DELETING IT SO THAT NO ONE CAN 
FIND YOU ON THE SERVICE. 
WE WOULD BE ABLE -- WE WOULD 
NOT BE ABLE TO RE-CREATE YOUR 
ACCOUNTS FROM THAT. 
WE DO HAVE DATA SYSTEMS THAT 
ARE REDUNDANT AND WE DO HAVE 
BACKUPS IN CASE SOMETHING BAD 
HAPPENS AND OVER A NUMBER OF 
DAYS, WE WILL GO THROUGH AND 
MAKE SURE TO FLUSH ALL OF THE 
CONTENT OUT OF THE SYSTEM BUT 
AS SOON AS YOU DELETE YOUR 
ACCOUNT, EFFECTIVELY, THAT 
CONTENT IS DISMANTLED AND WE 
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PUT YOUR 
ACCOUNTS BACK TOGETHER. 
>> WE RECOGNIZE A GENTLEMAN 
FROM MARYLAND. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
GOOD MORNING, MR. ZUCKERBERG. 
I WANT TO GET SOMETHING ON THE 
RECORD QUICKLY. 
YOU SUGGESTED IN YOUR TESTIMONY 
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS THAT 
FACEBOOK NOTIFIED TRUMP AND THE 
CLINTON CAMPAIGN'S OPPRESSION 
ATTEMPTS TO HACK INTO THOSE 
CAMPAIGNS BUT REPRESENTATIVES 
OF BOTH CAMPAIGNS OVER THE LAST 
24 HOURS SAY THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN 
SO WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO 
FOLLOW UP ON THAT. 
I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE ON. 
YOU CAN PROVIDE A RESPONSE TO 
THAT IN WRITING, IF YOU WOULD. 
LET ME ASK YOU, IS IT TRUE THAT 
FACEBOOK OFFERED TO PROVIDE TO 
DEDICATED CAMPAIGN EMBEDS TO 
BOTH THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS?
>>  CONGRESSMAN, I CAN QUICKLY 
RESPOND . 
>> YES OR NO? 
I NEED TO GET TO THAT. 
WERE THERE EMBEDS IN THE TWO 
CAMPAIGNS OR OFFERS?   
>>  CONGRESSMAN  -- WE -- 
>> WERE THERE EMBEDS? 
>> WE OFFER SELL AND SUPPORT. 
>> I WILL REFER TO THAT AS 
EMBEDS AND I GATHER FROM MR. 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN ULTIMATELY 
ACCEPTED THAT OFFER, IS THAT 
CORRECT? 
YES OR NO?   
>>  THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAD 
SALES  SUPPORT.    
>>  I WILL REFER TO THOSE AS 
EMBEDS. 
WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO IF 
I COULD -- WE WON'T HAVE TIME 
TO DO THIS NOW  BUT IF YOU 
COULD PROVIDE TO THE COMMITTEE 
BOTH THE INITIAL OFFER TERMS 
AND ANY SUBSEQUENT OFFER TERMS 
THAT WERE PRESENTED TO EACH 
CANDIDATE IN TERMS OF WHAT THE 
EMBED SERVICES WOULD BE, THAT 
WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. 
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY ADS WERE 
APPROVED FOR DISPLAY ON 
FACEBOOK FOR EACH OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES BY 
FACEBOOK? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, I DO NOT. 
SITTING HERE AT THE TOP OF MY 
HEAD -- 
>> -- LET ME TELL YOU BECAUSE I 
DO. 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN AN ESTIMATE OF 
FIVE POINT 9 MILLION ADS, 
SECRETARY CLINTON, 66,000 ADS, 
THAT IS 90 TIMES AS MUCH ON THE 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN WHICH RAISES 
SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER 
THE AD APPROVAL PROCESSES WERE 
MAYBE NOT PROCESSED CORRECTLY 
OR INAPPROPRIATELY BYPASSED IN 
THE FINAL WEEKS OF THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN AND WHAT I'M WONDERING 
ABOUT IS IF THE EMBEDS HELPED 
TO FACILITATE THAT. CAN YOU SAY 
WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT 
FACEBOOK OR ANY OF THE FACEBOOK 
EMPLOYEES WORKING AS CAMPAIGNING
DID NOT GRANT APPROVAL RIGHTS 
TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO ALLOW 
THEM TO UPLOAD A VERY LARGE 
NUMBER OF FACEBOOK ADS IN THAT 
FINAL STRETCH?    
>>  CONGRESSMAN, WE APPLY THE 
SAME STANDARDS TO ALL  
CAMPAIGNS. 
>> CAN YOU SAY THEY WERE NOT 
SPECIAL APPROVAL RIGHTS GRANTED?
WERE NOT SPECIAL APPROVAL 
RIGHTS GRANTED BY ANY OF THE 
EMBEDS OR SUPPORT FOLKS, AS YOU 
CALL THEM IN THAT TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN?    
>>  YES, WHAT I AM SAYING  -- 
SUSPECT IF YOU ARE SAYING YES, 
I WILL TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD. 
THE REASON THIS IS IMPORTANT 
AND THAT WE NEED TO GET TO THE 
BOTTOM OF IT IS BECAUSE IT 
COULD BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM IF 
THESE SERVICES WERE PROVIDED 
BECAUSE THAT COULD RESULT IN 
FINANCIAL CAMPAIGN -- LAW. 
CORPORATE CONTRIBUTION FROM 
FACEBOOK BEYOND THE OPPORTUNITY 
WOULD TYPICALLY PROVIDE. 
THE REASON I AM ASKING THESE 
QUESTIONS IS THAT I AM WORRIED 
THAT THE EMBED PROGRAM HAS THE 
POTENTIAL TO BECOME A TOOL FOR 
FACEBOOK TO SOLICIT FAVOR FROM 
POLICYMAKERS AND THAT CREATES 
THE POTENTIAL FOR REAL CONFLICT 
OF INTEREST. 
AND I THINK A LOT OF AMERICANS 
ARE WAKING UP TO THE FACT THAT 
FACEBOOK IS BECOMING SORT OF A 
SELF REGULATED SUPERSTRUCTURE 
FOR POLITICAL DISCOURSE. 
AND THE QUESTION IS, ARE WE, 
THE PEOPLE, GOING TO REGULATE 
OUR POLITICAL DIALOGUE OR ARE 
YOU, MARK ZUCKERBERG, 
REGULATING THE POLITICAL -- SO 
WE NEED TO BE FREE OF THAT 
UNDUE INFLUENCE.    
>>  THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS, MR. 
OLSON. 
>> DO YOU MIND FOR THE RECORD 
IF I JUST ANSWER  THE FIRST 
POINT. IT WILL TAKE 10 SECONDS. 
WHEN I WAS REFERRING TO THE 
CAMPAIGN, I MET THE DNC AND THE 
RNC. 
I MAY HAVE MISSPOKEN. 
THAT IS TECHNICALLY CALLED THE 
COMMITTEES BUT THOSE OF THE 
FOLKS I WAS REFERRING TO. 
>> THANKS FOR THAT 
CLARIFICATION. 
WE NOW GO TO MR. OLSON. 
>> I THINK THE CHAIR AND MR. 
ZUCKERBERG, I KNOW WE BOTH WISH 
WE WERE MEETING UNDER DIFFERENT 
CIRCUMSTANCES. 
THE STORY BROKE WITH CORDIS 
SAYING, I STARTED FACEBOOK. 
I RUN IT. 
I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT 
HAPPENS HERE.
". HE SAID THE SAME WORDS IN 
YOUR OPENING STATEMENT AN HOUR 
AND HALF AGO. 
I KNOW YOU BELIEVE THAT IN YOUR 
HEART. 
IT IS NOT JUST SOME TALKING 
POINTS OR CANNED SPEECH. 
NINE YEARS IN THE NAVY, I KNOW 
THE BEST OFFICERS, THE BEST 
SKIPPERS AND THE BEST CEOS HAVE 
THAT EXACT SAME ATTITUDE. 
IF FACEBOOK WAS A NAVY SHIP, 
YOUR PRIVACY HAS TAKEN A DIRECT 
HIT. 
YOU ARE TAKING ON WATER AND 
YOUR FUTURE MAY BE DEFINED. 
TODAY, OVER $1 BILLION IN FINES 
ARE COMING YOUR WAY. 
AS YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO 
REINFORCE YOUR WORDS WITH 
ACTIONS. 
A FEW QUESTIONS HAVE HAPPENED 
IN THE PAST. 
FIRST OF ALL, BACK IN 2012, 
FACEBOOK DID AN EXPERIMENT ON 
609,003 FACEBOOK USERS. 
YOU REDUCED POSITIVE POSTS FROM 
USES FRIENDS AND LIMITED SO-
CALLED DATA POSTS FROM OTHER 
FRIENDS. 
ONE GROUP SOUGHT IS POSITIVE 
AND THE OTHER GROUP, NEGATIVE. 
THE GOAL WAS TO SEE HOW THIS 
WOULD AFFECT BEHAVIOR. 
I WAS GIVEN A SPORTS ARTICLE 
FOR THE LA TIMES. I WANT TO 
TALK ABOUT THAT. 
THIS IS DISSECTING PEOPLE IN 
STARK CONTRAST TO CONNECTING 
PEOPLE. EXPLAIN HOW YOU THOUGHT 
THIS IDEA WAS A GOOD IDEA? 
EXPLAIN WITH PEOPLE.    
>>  I DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY 
OF NOT JUST BUILDING SERVICES 
THAT PEOPLE LIKE TO USE BUT 
MAKING SURE THOSE SERVICES ARE 
ALSO  GOOD FOR PEOPLE AND GOOD 
FOR SOCIETY. 
AT THE TIME, THERE WERE A 
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT 
WHETHER PEOPLE SEEING CONTENT 
THAT WAS EITHER POSITIVE OR 
NEGATIVE ON SOCIAL NETWORKS WAS 
AFFECTING THEIR MOOD. AND WE 
FELT LIKE WE HAD A 
RESPONSIBILITY TO UNDERSTAND 
WHETHER THAT WAS THE CASE 
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE 
THAT EFFECT. 
WE WANT USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND 
OUR PRODUCTS TO BE GOOD FOR 
PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING. 
WE CONTINUE TO MAKE CHANGES TO 
THAT EFFECT. 
INCLUDING RECENTLY, THIS YEAR. 
WE DID A NUMBER OF RESEARCH 
PROJECTS THAT SHOWED THAT WHEN 
SOCIAL MEDIA IS USED FOR 
BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS, WHEN 
YOU ARE INTERACTING WITH 
PEOPLE, AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH 
A LOT OF POSITIVE EFFECTS OF 
WELL-BEING THAT YOU WOULD 
EXPECT AND IT MAKES YOU FEEL 
LESS CONNECTED SOCIAL MORE 
ONNECTED AND LESS LONELY. 
WHEREAS, IF YOU ARE USING THE 
SOCIAL MEDIA TO PASSIVELY 
CONSUME COMPETENCE, THAT 
DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME POSITIVE 
EFFECTS AND CAN EVEN BE 
NEGATIVE. 
WE TRY TO SHIFT TOWARD HELPING 
PEOPLE TO INTERACT AS A RESULT 
OF THAT AND THAT IS AN EXAMPLE 
OF THE KIND OF WORK THAT WE DO. 
>> I BELIEVE I HAVE HEARD YOU 
EMPLOY 27,000 PEOPLE, 
THEREABOUTS. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> YES. 
>> I HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT 
ABOUT 20,000 PEOPLE INCLUDING 
CONTRACTORS WORK ON DATA 
SECURITY, IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> THE 20,000 NUMBER IS FULL 
TIME EMPLOYEES AND THE SECURITY 
CONTENT INCLUDES CONTRACTORS OF 
WHICH THERE ARE TENS OF 
THOUSANDS ARE THERE WILL BE. 
>> HALF OF YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE 
DEDICATED TO SECURITY 
PRACTICES. 
HOW CAN CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 
WITH SO MUCH OF YOUR WORKFORCE 
DEDICATED TO THESE CAUSES, HOW 
DID THAT HAPPEN?! 
>> CONGRESSMAN, THE ISSUE OF 
CAMERA GENERALS THE CAT AND 
ALEXANDER: -- ALEKSANDR KOGAN --
THE SHEER CONTENT ON FACEBOOK 
MAKES IT SO THAT NO AMOUNT OF 
PEOPLE YOU CAN HIRE WILL BE 
ENOUGH TO REVIEW ALL OF THE 
CONTENT. 
WE NEED TO RELY ON AND BUILD 
SOPHISTICATED AI TOOLS THAT CAN 
HELP US FLAG CERTAIN CONTENT 
AND WE ARE GETTING GOOD IN 
CERTAIN AREAS. 
ONE OF THE AREAS I MENTIONED 
EARLIER WAS TERRORIST CONTENT 
WHERE WE NOW HAVE SYSTEMS THAT 
CAN IDENTIFY AND TAKE DOWN 99% 
OF THE AL QAEDA AND ICES RELATED
CONTENT IN OUR SYSTEM BEFORE 
SOMEONE EVEN FLACCID. 
I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE OF 
THAT.    
>>  IT IS NOW TIME FOR THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM CALIFORNIA. 
>>  MR. ZUCKERBERG, I THANK YOU 
FOR AGREEING TO TESTIFY BEFORE 
THE HOUSE AND SENATE 
COMMITTEES. 
I KNOW IT IS A LONG AND 
GRUELING PROCESS AND I 
APPRECIATE YOUR COOPERATION. 
I HAVE A MATHEMATICIAN AND 
SPENT YEARS IN GOVERNMENT 
DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING 
ALGORITHMS. 
MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS ARE 
AFFECTED BY THESE. 
I AM DEEPLY COMMITTED AND I 
WILL FOLLOW UP ON AN EARLIER 
QUESTION. 
IS THERE A CURRENT PLACE I CAN 
DOWNLOAD ALL OF THE FACEBOOK 
INFORMATION ABOUT ME INCLUDING 
WEBSITES THAT I HAVE VISITED?   
>>  YES, CONGRESSMAN.  
WE HAVE A "DOWNLOAD YOUR 
INFORMATION" TOOL. WE HAVE HAD 
IT FOR YEARS.    
>>  MY STAFF  DOWNLOADED THEIR 
INFORMATION AND THEIR BROWSING 
HISTORY IS NOT IN THERE SO ARE 
YOU SAYING THAT FACEBOOK DOES 
NOT HAVE BROWSING HISTORY? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, THAT WOULD BE 
CORRECT. 
IF WE DON'T HAVE CONTENT IN 
THERE, THAT MEANS YOU DON'T 
HAVE IT ON FACEBOOK. 
>> I AM NOT QUITE ON BOARD WITH 
THIS. 
IS THERE ANY OTHER INFORMATION 
THAT FACEBOOK HAS CONTAINED -- 
OBTAINED ABOUT ME THAT WOULD 
NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE 
DOWNLOAD? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, MY 
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ALL OF 
YOUR INFORMATION IS INCLUDED IN 
THE DOWNLOAD INFORMATION. 
>> I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THIS 
AFTERWORDS. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, YOU INDICATED 
THAT THE EUROPEAN USERS WOULD 
HAVE GD RP PROTECTIONS AND 
AMERICANS WOULD HAVE NO SIMILAR 
PROTECTIONS. 
WHEN WITH THE AMERICAN USERS 
HAVE THOSE PROTECTIONS? 
>> WE ARE WORKING ON DOING THAT 
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. 
I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT DATE, 
YET. 
WE ARE WORKING ON IT. 
>> YOUR COMPANY AND MANY 
COMPANIES HAVE A STAGGERING 
AMOUNT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. 
THE CUSTOMER IS NOT REALLY IN 
THE DRIVER SEAT ABOUT HOW THERE 
DATA IS USED OR MONETIZED. 
TODAY, MONITORED BY PRIVACY 
PROTECTIONS. 
I WILL INTRODUCE LEGISLATION 
THAT WILL HELP WITH THIS ISSUE. 
WITHOUT THIS KIND OF 
LEGISLATION, HOW CAN WE BE SURE 
THAT FACEBOOK WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE CARELESS WITH USERS 
INFORMATION?   
>>  CONGRESSMAN,  LET ME FIRST 
SET ASIDE THAT MY POSITION 
ISN'T THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO 
REGULATION. 
REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS IN 
PLACE, WE HAVE A VERY STRONG 
INCENTIVE TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S 
INFORMATION. 
THIS IS THE CORE THING THAT 
FACEBOOK IS, 100 BILLION TIMES 
A DAY, PEOPLE COME TO OUR 
SERVICE TO SHARE A PHOTO OR 
SHARE A MESSAGE. 
>> I HEAR YOU SAYING THIS BUT 
THE HISTORY ISN'T THERE. 
SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO MAKE 
SURE THAT THERE ARE REGULATIONS 
IN PLACE TO GIVE YOU THE PROPER 
MOTIVATION TO STAY ONLINE WITH 
DATA PROTECTION. 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS HERE IN MY 
MIND IS FACEBOOK'S HISTORY. 
THE USER PRIVACY AND SECURITY 
HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN HIGH 
PRIORITY AND YOU HAVE ADMITTED 
AS MUCH. 
IS FACEBOOK CONSIDERING 
CHANGING ITS STRUCTURE TO 
ENSURE THAT PRIVACY AND SECURITY
HAVE SUFFICIENT PRIORITY TO 
PREVENT THESE PROBLEMS IN THE 
FUTURE? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS AN 
INCREDIBLE HIGH PRIORITY FOR US.
PEOPLE COME AND TRY TO SHARE 
SOMETHING WITH A SPECIFIC SET 
OF PEOPLE. 
THAT WORKS BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE 
CONFIDENCE THAT IF THEY SEND A 
MESSAGE, IT IS GOING TO GO TO 
THE PERSON THEY WANT. 
IF THEY WANT TO SHARE A PHOTO, 
IT GOES TO THE PEOPLE THEY 
WANT. 
THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. 
>> THAT'S A LITTLE OFF TRACK 
FROM WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET A. 
THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS CLEARLY 
FAILED IN A COUPLE OF CASES 
THAT ARE HIGH-PROFILE, RIGHT 
NOW. 
AND PART OF THE BLAME THAT 
SEEMS TO BE OUT THERE IS THE 
MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE FOR 
PRIVACY AND SECURITY DON'T HAVE 
THE RIGHT LEVEL OF PROFILE AND 
FACEBOOK TO GET YOUR ATTENTION 
TO BE SURE THEY GET THE PROPER 
RESOURCES.
>> YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED. 
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES MR. 
KINLEY. 
>> THANK YOU. 
I'VE GOT A YES OR NO QUESTION. 
SHOULD FACEBOOK ENABLE ILLEGAL 
ONLINE PHARMACIES TO SELL DRUGS 
LIKE OXYCONTIN, PERCOCET, 
VICODIN, WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION?
>>  CONGRESSMAN,  THAT IS 
AGAINST OUR POLICIES. 
OF COURSE NOT.
>> THERE ARE 35,000 ONLINE 
PHARMACIES OPERATING AND 
ACCORDING TO THE FDA, THEY 
THINK THERE MAY BE 96% OF THEM 
OPERATING ILLEGALLY. 
AND ON NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR, 
CNBC HAD AN ARTICLE SAYING THAT 
YOU WERE SURPRISED BY THE 
BREATH OF THIS OPIOID CRISIS 
AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THESE 
PHOTOGRAPHS, OPIOIDS ARE STILL 
AVAILABLE ON YOUR SITE. 
THAT THEY ARE WITHOUT A 
PRESCRIPTION ON YOUR SITE. 
SO THAT CONTRADICTS WHAT YOU 
JUST SAID A MINUTE AGO AND IT 
WENT ON LAST WEEK, THE FDA 
COMMISSIONER, SCOTT GOTLAND, 
HAS TESTIFIED SAYING THE 
INTERNET FIRMS SIMPLY ARE NOT 
TAKING PRACTICAL STEPS TO FIND 
AND REMOVE THESE ILLEGAL OPIOID 
LISTINGS AND HE SPECIFICALLY 
MENTIONED FACEBOOK. ARE YOU 
AWARE OF THAT? 
HIS QUOTE? 
YES OR NO? 
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF HIS QUOTE 
BUT I HEARD THAT HE SAID 
SOMETHING AND LET ME JUST SPEAK 
TO THIS FOR A SECOND. 
>> NO. 
IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT OCEAN 
I APPRECIATED YOUR REMARK -- 
YOU SAID, IT'S NOT ENOUGH, WE 
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE 
USING FACEBOOK CAN'T HURT 
PEOPLE. 
AMERICA IS IN THE MIDST OF ONE 
OF THE WORST EPIDEMICS IT HAS 
EVER EXPERIENCED WITH THIS DRUG 
EPIDEMIC AND IT IS ALL ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY AND NOT JUST WEST 
VIRGINIA BUT YOUR PLATFORM IS 
STILL BEING USED TO CIRCUMVENT 
THE LAW AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO BUY 
HIGHLY ADDICTIVE DRUGS WITHOUT 
A PRESCRIPTION. 
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, FACEBOOK 
IS ACTUALLY ENABLING ILLEGAL 
ACTIVITY AND IN SO DOING, YOU 
ARE HURTING PEOPLE. WOULD YOU 
AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, I THINK THERE 
ARE A NUMBER OF AREAS OF 
COUNTRY AND DOES CONTENT THAT 
WE COULD DO A BETTER JOB. 
TODAY, IN REVIEW, PEOPLE CAN 
SHARE WHAT THEY WANT OPENLY ON 
THE SERVICE AND IF SOMEONE SEES 
AN ISSUE, THEY CAN FIND IT TO 
US AND WE WILL REVIEW IT.    
>>  YOU CAN FIND OUT, MR. 
ZUCKERBERG, YOU KNOW WHICH 
PHARMACIES ARE OPERATING 
LEGALLY AND ILLEGALLY  BUT YOU 
CONTINUE TO ALLOW THAT TO BE 
POSTED ON FACEBOOK AND ALLOW 
PEOPLE TO GET THIS SCOURGE, 
THIS RAVAGE IN THIS COUNTRY 
BEING ENABLED BECAUSE OF 
FACEBOOK. 
MY QUESTION TO YOU AS WE CLOSE 
ON THIS, HE SAID BEFORE THAT 
YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE DOWN 
THOSE ADS. 
WHAT YOU DIDN'T DO IT. 
WE HAVE STATEMENT AFTER 
STATEMENT ABOUT THINGS. 
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THOSE DOWN 
IN DAYS AND THEY HAVEN'T GONE 
DOWN. 
THAT WAS JUST FROM YESTERDAY. 
IT IS STILL UP! 
SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, WHEN 
ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE DOWN 
THESE POSTS? 
THEY ARE DONE WITH THE ILLEGAL 
DIGITAL PHARMACIES.    
>>  RIGHT NOW, WHEN PEOPLE 
REPORT THEM TO US, WE WILL TAKE 
THEM DOWN .   
>>  YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE UP 
THERE.  
WHERE IS YOUR REQUIREMENT? 
WHERE IS YOUR ACCOUNTABILITY TO 
ALLOW THIS TO BE OCCURRING? 
RAVAGING THIS COUNTRY? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, I AGREE THAT 
THIS IS A TERRIBLE ISSUE AND 
RESPECTFULLY, WHEN THERE ARE 
TENS OF BILLIONS OR 100 BILLION 
PIECES OF CONTENT SHARED EVERY 
DAY, EVEN 20,000 PEOPLE 
REVIEWING IT CANNOT LOOK AT 
EVERYTHING. 
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS BUILD 
MORE AR TOOLS.    
>>  YOU HAVE SAID BEFORE THAT 
YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE THEM DOWN 
AND YOU HAVEN'T. 
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM BERNARD  -- 
VERMONT. 
>> YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT 
FACEBOOK MADE A MISTAKE. 
YOU DID AN ANALYSIS OF HOW IT 
HAPPENED. 
YOU PROMISED ACTION AND WE ARE 
AT THE POINT WHERE THE ACTION 
WILL SPEAK MUCH LOUDER THAN THE 
WORDS. 
BUT CONGRESS HAS MADE A 
MISTAKE. 
THIS EVENT THAT HAPPENED 
WHETHER IT WAS FACEBOOK OR SOME 
OTHER PLATFORM WAS FORESEEABLE 
AND INEVITABLE AND WE DID 
NOTHING ABOUT IT. 
CONGRESSMAN BLACKBURN AND I HAD 
A PROPHECY WORKING GROUP, SIX 
MEETINGS WITH MANY OF THE 
INDUSTRY PLAYERS. 
THERE WAS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT ON 
BOTH SIDES. 
POLICY WAS NOT BEING PROTECTED. 
BUT THERE WAS AN INABILITY TO 
COME TO THE CONCLUSION. 
WE ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION AND 
IN AN EFFORT TO MOVE FORWARD, 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, I HAVE FRAMED 
SOME QUESTIONS. 
TO SEE IF THERE IS SOME COMMON 
GROUND, YOU HAVE AND WE 
CERTAINLY HAVE THE OBLIGATION 
TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THE 
AMERICAN CONSUMERS. 
FIRST, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT 
CONSUMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
KNOW AND CONTROL WHAT PERSONAL 
DATA COMPANIES COLLECT FROM 
THEM? 
>> YES. 
>> DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE A 
RIGHT TO KNOW HOW AND WITH WHOM 
THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS 
SHARED WITH THIRD PARTIES?    
>>  OF COURSE. 
>> DO YOU BELIEVE CONSUMERS 
HAVE A RIGHT TO SECURE  THE 
RESPONSIBLE HANDLING OF THEIR 
PERSONAL DATA?   
>>  YES,  CONGRESSMAN. 
>> AND DO YOU BELIEVE THEY 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO EASILY PLACE 
LIMITS ON THE PERSONAL DATA 
THAT COMPANIES COLLECT AND 
RETAIN?    
>>  CONGRESSMAN, THAT SEEMS 
LIKE A REASONABLE PRINCIPLE TO 
ME. 
>> AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT 
CONSUMERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO 
CORRECT OR DELETE INACCURATE 
PERSONAL DATA  THAT COMPANIES 
HAVE OBTAINED?   
>>  CONGRESSMAN, THAT MIGHT BE 
MORE INTERESTING TO DEBATE .   
>>  YOU GET BACK TO US WITH  
SPECIFICS. 
I THINK THEY DO HAVE THAT 
RIGHT. 
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT CONSUMERS 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR 
DATA DELETED IMMEDIATELY FROM 
FACEBOOK WHEN THEY STOP USING 
THE SERVICE? 
>> YES AND THEY HAVE THAT 
ABILITY. 
THAT'S GOOD. 
AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE 
FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION OR 
ANOTHER PROPERLY RESOURCED 
GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY WITH 
RULEMAKING AUTHORITY SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO DETERMINE ON A REGULAR 
BASIS WHAT IS CONSIDERED 
PERSONAL INFORMATION, TO 
PROVIDE CERTAINTY FOR CONSUMERS 
AND COMPANIES? 
WHAT INFORMATION NEEDS TO BE 
PROTECTED MOST TIGHTLY? 
>> CONGRESSMAN, I CERTAINLY 
THINK THAT IS AN AREA WHERE WE 
SHOULD DISCUSS SOME SORT OF 
OVERSIGHT. 
>> WHO GETS THE FINAL SAY? 
IS IT THE FINAL MARKET, 
COMPANIES LIKE YOURS OR IS 
THERE A GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTION 
THAT DEFINES WHAT PRIVACY IS?   
>>  CONGRESSMAN, I DID THAT 
THIS IS AN AREA WHERE SOME 
REGULATION MAKES SENSE .    
>>  LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 
WILL YOU WORK WITH THIS 
COMMITTEE  TO HELP THE U.S. PUT 
IN PLACE OUR OWN PRIVACY 
REGULATION THAT PRIORITIZES 
CONSUMER RIGHTS TO PRIVACY JUST 
AS THE EU HAS DONE?    
>>  CONGRESSMAN, YES. 
I WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE WORK 
WITH YOU TO FLESH THIS OUT. 
>> AND YOU HAVE INDICATED THAT 
FACEBOOK HAS NOT ALWAYS 
PROTECTED THE PRIVACY OF THEIR 
USERS THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY'S 
HISTORY AND IT SEEMS FROM YOUR 
ANSWERS THAT CAN YOU AGREE THAT 
CONSUMERS DO HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL 
RIGHT TO PRIVACY THAT EMPOWERS 
THEM TO CONTROL THE COLLECTION 
USED IN THE SHARING OF THEIR 
PERSONAL INFORMATION ONLINE. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, THANK YOU. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, PRIVACY CANNOT BE 
BASED JUST ON COMPANY POLICIES. 
WHETHER IT IS FACEBOOK OR ANY 
OTHER COMPANY, THERE HAS TO BE 
A WILLINGNESS ON THE PART OF 
THIS CONGRESS TO STEP UP AND 
PROVIDE POLICY PROTECTIONS TO 
THE POLICY RIGHTS OF EVERY 
AMERICAN CONSUMER. 
I YIELD BACK.>> THE CHAIR 
RECOGNIZES THE GENTLEMAN FROM 
ILLINOIS. 
>> GIVEN THE GLOBAL REACH OF 
FACEBOOK, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW 
ABOUT THE COMPANIES POLICIES 
AND PRACTICES. 
WHAT PERSONAL DATA DOES 
FACEBOOK MAKE AVAILABLE FROM 
FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM TO RUSSIAN 
STATE AGENCIES.    
>>  CONGRESSMAN, IN GENERAL, 
THE WAY WE APPROACH DATA  AND 
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THAT WE HAVE 
KNOWLEDGE OF IMMINENT HARM, 
PHYSICAL HARM THAT MAY HAPPEN 
TO SOMEONE. 
WE TRY TO REACH OUT TO LOCAL 
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PREVENT 
THAT. 
I THINK THAT LEFT NO DOUBT IN 
THE WORLD AND MORE BUILDOUT IN 
THE USA. 
FOR EXAMPLE, WE BUILT A 
SPECIFIC PROGRAM FOR 3000 
PEOPLE THAT ARE FOCUSED THAT IF 
WE DETECT SOMEONE IS AT RISK OF 
HARMING THEMSELVES, WE CAN GET 
THEM -- 
>> WHAT ABOUT RUSSIAN INTEL 
AGENCIES? 
>> THE SECOND CATEGORY IS WHEN 
THERE IS VALID LEGAL PROCESS 
SERVED TO US. 
IF SOMEONE PUT SOMETHING OUT 
THAT IS OVERLY BROAD, WE WILL 
FIGHT BACK ON IT. 
IF THERE IS VALID SERVICE IN 
THE U.S., WE WILL WORK WITH LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
IN GENERAL, WE ARE NOT IN THE 
BUSINESS OF PROVIDING A LOT OF 
INFORMATION. 
>> IS THIS FROM ACCOUNTS LOCATED
TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES? 
-- IS THE DATA ONLY FROM 
ACCOUNTS LOCATED IN THOSE 
COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF RUSSIA OR 
ANYTHING? 
OR DOES IT INCLUDE FACEBOOK'S 
GLOBAL DATA?    
>>  IN GENERAL, COUNTRIES DO 
NOT HAVE JURISDICTION TO HAVE 
ANY  VALID LEGAL REASON TO 
REQUEST DATA FROM SOMEONE 
OUTSIDE OF THEIR COUNTRY.    
>>  WE DON'T STORE ANY DATA IN 
RUSSIA. 
>> IT IS GLOBAL DATA. 
>> WE ARE IN AN ARMS RACE WITH 
RUSSIA BUT IS IT ONE-SIDED. 
GIVEN THE OPPOSITION AND 
EVERYTHING IT NEEDS IN TERMS OF 
WHERE IT IS STORING ITS DATA. 
YOU MENTIONED A FEW TIMES THAT 
WE ARE IN AN ARMS RACE WITH 
RUSSIA. 
IF YOU'RE GIVING RUSSIAN AGENTS 
ACCESS TO GLOBAL DATA THAT IS 
NOT RUSSIAN, IS THAT KIND OF A 
DISADVANTAGE TO US AND A 
DISADVANTAGE TO --    
>>  CONGRESSMAN, LET ME BE MORE 
SPECIFIC -- I HAVE NO SPECIFIC 
KNOWLEDGE OF ANY DATA WE HAVE 
GIVEN TO RUSSIA. 
WE WILL WORK WITH VALID LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AND GET BACK TO YOU 
WITH WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN FOR 
RUSSIA, SPECIFICALLY BUT I HAVE 
NO KNOWLEDGE THAT AT ANY TIME 
WOULD WE HAVE GIVEN THEM THAT 
INFORMATION. 
>> TODAY, AND I AM NOT SAYING 
THIS AS A WINDOWS ME/I THINK 
THIS HELPS A LOT OF PEOPLE. 
MY PICTURES HAVE BEEN STOLEN 
AND USED IN BUT ACCOUNTS ALL 
AROUND AND IN MANY CASES, 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXTORTED FOR 
MONEY. 
WE REPORTED WOMEN CAN. I JUST 
PUT ON YOUR WEBSITE, AND YOUR 
KISS JUST. 
HE SAYS HE IS FROM LONDON AND 
LIVES IN LA AND WENT TO LOCKE 
HIGH SCHOOL WHICH ISN'T 
ANYTHING LIKE ME AT ALL. 
THESE ACCOUNTS POP UP A LOT AND 
IT IS USING MY PICTURES AND 
EXTORTING PEOPLE FOR MONEY AND 
WE HEAR ABOUT IT FROM PEOPLE 
WHO CALL AND SAY, I WAS DUPED. 
I KNOW YOU CAN'T CONTROL 
EVERYTHING AND YOU HAVE A HUGE 
PLATFORM BUT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT 
SOME MOVEMENTS IN THE FUTURE TO 
TRY TO PREVENT THAT IN TERMS OF 
RECOGNIZING SOMEONE'S PICTURE 
AND IF IT IS FAKE IT 
>> YES, CONGRESSMAN. 
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. 
THAT'S HOW A LOT OF THE OTHER 
ISSUES AROUND FAKE NEWS AND FOR 
AN ELECTION INTERFERENCE ARE 
HAPPENING, AS WELL. 
THE LONG-TERM SOLUTION IS TO 
BUILD MORE AI TOOLS THAT FIND 
PATTERNS OF PEOPLE USING THE 
SERVICES THAT NO REAL PERSON 
WOULD DO. 
AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO 
THAT IN ORDER TO TAKE DOWN TENS 
OF THOUSANDS OF ACCOUNTS 
ESPECIALLY IN ELECTIONS. 
AND LAST YEAR'S ALABAMA STATE 
ELECTION. 
SENATE ELECTION, SPECIAL 
ELECTION. 
AND THAT IS WHERE WE SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO EXTEND NETWORK AND 
DEVELOP MORE ARTICLES.    
>>  THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM  NEW MEXICO. 
>> I WANT TO PICK UP WHERE MR. 
KISSINGER DROPPED OFF. 
FACEBOOK RECENTLY ANNOUNCED 
THAT A SEARCH FEATURE ALLOWING 
MALICIOUS ACTORS TO SCRAPE DATA 
ON ALL OF FACEBOOK'S 2 BILLION 
USERS. 
DEMONSTRATING THIS FEATURE 
COULD EASILY BE USED TOGETHER 
INFORMATION UPSCALE. THE ANSWER 
TO THAT QUESTION IS YES. 
YES OR NO. 
THIS ISSUE OF SCRAPING DATA WAS 
RAISED IN 2015 BY A CYBER 
SECURITY RESEARCHER, CORRECT?   
>>  I AM NOT SPECIFICALLY KNOW 
YOU'RE WITH THAT.  
THE FEATURE WE IDENTIFIED A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WAS A 
SEARCH FEATURE THAT ALLOWED 
PEOPLE TO LOOK UP SOME 
INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE HAD 
PUBLICLY SHARED, NAMES, PROFILE 
PICTURES. 
BUT I WILL RECOGNIZE THAT IN 
THE FUTURE. 
MY QUESTION AND THE REASON I'M 
ASKING ABOUT 2013 AND 2015 IS 
THAT FACEBOOK KNEW ABOUT THIS 
AT THAT TIME AND DID NOT TURN 
THE FEATURE OFF UNTIL WEDNESDAY 
OF LAST WEEK. 
THE SAME PICTURE THAT MISSED IT 
OR JUST TALKED ABOUT WHERE THIS 
IS ESSENTIALLY A TOOL FOR THESE 
MALICIOUS ACTORS TO GO AND 
STILL SOMEONE'S IDENTITY AND 
PUT THE FISHING -- AND PUT THE 
FINISHING TOUCHES ON IT. 
ONE OF YOUR MENTORS HAS 
RECENTLY SAID YOUR BUSINESS IS 
BASED ON TRUST. 
WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG? 
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING 
ABOUT THESE OTHER ISSUES. 
LEAVING MANY PEOPLE VULNERABLE. 
ONTO ANOTHER SUBJECT, FACEBOOK 
HAS DETAILED PROFILES ON PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE NEVER SIGNED UP ON 
FACEBOOK. 
YES OR NO?>> IN GENERAL, WE 
HAVE COLLECTED DATA FOR 
SECURITY PURPOSES, TO PREVENT 
THE KIND OF SCRAPING THAT YOU 
ARE REFERRING TO. 
CONGRESSMAN, I AM NOT FAMILIAR 
WITH THAT.
>> ON AVERAGE, HOW MANY DATA 
POINTS DOES FACEBOOK HAVE A 
USER? 
I DO NOT KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY 
HEAD.    
>>  THE AVERAGE IS 1500. 
IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT 
FACEBOOK HAS AS MANY AS 25,000 
DATA POINTS  FOR AN AVERAGE 
USER. 
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY POINTS OF 
DATA THAT FACEBOOK HAS ON THE 
AVERAGE NON-FACEBOOK USER?    
>>  CONGRESSMAN, I DO NOT . I 
CAN HAVE OUR TEAM GET BACK TO 
YOU, AFTERWARDS. 
>> IT HAS BEEN ADMITTED THAT 
YOU DO COLLECT DATA POINTS ON A 
NON-AVERAGE USER. 
MY QUESTION IS, CAN SOMEONE WHO 
DOES NOT HAVE A FACEBOOK 
ACCOUNT OPT OUT OF THE 
INVOLUNTARY DATA COLLECTION?    
>>  CONGRESSMAN, ANYONE CAN 
TURN OFF  AND OPT OUT OF ANY 
DATA COLLECTION FOR ADS WHETHER 
THEY USE OUR SERVICES ON THE 
BUT IN ORDER TO PREVENT PEOPLE 
FROM SCRAPING PUBLIC 
INFORMATION. 
WHICH, AGAIN, THE SEARCH 
FEATURE YOU BROUGHT UP ONLY 
SHOWS PUBLIC INFORMATION, 
PEOPLE'S NAMES AND PROFILES 
THAT THEY HAVE MADE PUBLIC BUT 
WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE EVEN 
AGGREGATING PUBLIC INFORMATION. 
WE WANT TO KNOW WHEN SOMEONE IS 
TRYING TO REPEATEDLY ACCESS OUR 
SERVICES. 
>> IT MAY SURPRISE YOU THAT WE 
HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT THIS A 
LOT STATE BUT YOU SAY EVERYONE 
CONTROLS THEIR DATA BUT YOU ARE 
COLLECTING DATA ON THOSE WHO 
HAVE NOT SIGNED THE CONSENT OR 
PRIVACY AGREEMENT AND YOU ARE 
COLLECTING THE DATA AND IT MAY 
SURPRISE YOU IT TAKES YOU TO A 
FORM THAT'S ASSOCIATED FACEBOOK 
PAGE AND YOU CAN DOWNLOAD YOUR 
DATA. 
YOU ARE DIRECTING PEOPLE WHO 
DON'T HAVE ACCESS OR A FACEBOOK 
PAGE TO SIGN UP TO REACH THEIR 
DATA. 
WE GOT TO FIX THAT. 
THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE, HAVE 
YOU DISCLOSED TO THIS COMMITTEE 
OR ANYONE ALL INFORMATION 
FACEBOOK HAS UNCOVERED ABOUT 
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE ON YOUR 
PLATFORM?   
>>  CONGRESSMAN,  WE ARE 
WORKING WITH THE AUTHORITIES ON 
THAT.    
>>  GENTLEMEN, YOUR TIME HAS 
EXPIRED.  
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM VIRGINIA.    
>>  I APPRECIATE THAT VERY 
MUCH. 
LET ME STATE  THAT I SHARE THE 
PRIVACY CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE 
HEARD FROM A LOT OF US AND I 
APPRECIATE YOUR STATEMENTS AND 
WILLINGNESS TO HELP US FIGURE 
OUT A SOLUTION GOOD FOR THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
I APPRECIATE THAT. 
SECONDLY, I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT 
IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MY 
FRIEND AND NEIGHBORING -- IN 
THE NEIGHBORING STATE ASKED YOU 
ABOUT FACEBOOK'S PLANS FOR 
BROADBAND AND YOU AGREED TO 
SHARE THAT INFORMATION AND GET 
HER UP TO DATE AND UP TO SPEED. 
I WAS EXCITED TO HEAR THAT YOU 
WERE EXCITED ABOUT THAT AND 
PASSIONATE ABOUT IT. 
MY DISTRICT IS VERY SIMILAR. 
WEST VIRGINIA BORDERS IT. 
CAN YOU ALSO AGREE, YES OR NO, 
TO UPDATE ME ON THAT WHEN THE 
INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?   
>>  YES, WE WILL CERTAINLY 
FOLLOW 
>>> HE HAS BEEN FIELDING 
QUESTIONS ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES 
INCLUDING THE CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICAL DATA SCANDAL.  
WE WILL GET RIGHT BACK TO THE 
TESTIMONY IN JUST A MINUTE.  
WE WANT TO BRING YOU UP TO 
SPEED ON OTHER DEVELOPMENTS.  
AT THIS HOUR AT THE U.S. IS ON 
THE BRINK OF TAKING THREE 
ACTION AGAINST SYRIA.  
TODAY THE PRESIDENT PUBLICLY 
VOWED TO TEST RUSSIA'S A 
MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM IN SYRIA 
BY TWEETING "MISSILES WILL BE 
COMING, NICE, NEW AND SMART."  
THIS IS THE LATEST ESCALATION 
IN TENSIONS BETWEEN RUSSIA AND 
THE U.S.  THE PRESIDENT SAID 
TODAY OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH 
RUSSIA IS WORSE NOW THAN IT WAS 
DURING THE COLD WAR.  
THE PRESIDENT DID ADD THERE IS 
NO REASON FOR THIS AND 
ENCOURAGED ALL NATIONS TO WORK 
TOGETHER.  
THE TENSIONS WERE PROVOKED BY A 
ALLEGED DEADLY CHEMICAL ATTACK. 
THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WAS 
ACCUSED OF CARRYING OUT THE 
ASSAULT BUT DENIES ANY 
INVOLVEMENT. 
RUSSIA IS STANDING BY SYRIA AND 
WARNING OF SERIOUS 
REPERCUSSIONS IF THE U.S. OR 
OTHER NATIONS STRIKE.  AS THIS 
UNFOLD AS WAS THE THIRD PERSON 
IN LINE TO THE PRESIDENCY HAS 
ANNOUNCED HE WILL LEAVE OFFICE.
>> I THINK WE HAVE ACHIEVED A 
LOT.  
YOU ALL KNOW THAT I DID NOT 
SEEK THIS JOB.  
I TOOK IT RELUCTANTLY, BUT I 
HAVE GIVEN THIS JOB MY ALL.  
I HAVE NO REGRETS WHAT SO EVER, 
THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST 
TWO GREATEST OWNERS OF MY LIFE. 
THE JOB PROVIDES INCREDIBLE 
OPPORTUNITIES.
>>> CONGRESS IS NOT GOING TO DO 
A LOT ANYWAY, THE TIMING IS 
DICTATED BECAUSE SOMETHING LIKE 
THIS CAN'T BE A SECRET IN 
WASHINGTON.
AT THE CONGRESS THEY HAVE TO 
FIGURE OUT WHO IS GOING TO 
REPLACE HIM AS LEADER OR SPEAKER
DEPENDING ON IF REPUBLICANS 
HOLD ON TO THE HOUSE.  
IN TERMS OF LEGISLATING THERE 
IS NOT A LOT OF CHOOSE THAT 
PAUL RYAN HAS.  
LAWMAKERS AT THIS POINT HAVE 
HIT THAT STAGE WHERE THEY ARE 
FOCUSED ON THE ONLY ELECTION.  
THERE -- THERE IS NOT ANY -- 
THERE IS NOT A LOT LEFT ON 
THEIR PLATE TO ACTUALLY DO OF 
ANY STEP SINCE.  
NOTHING THAT WILL BRING IN A 
STRICT PARTY LINE VOTES.  
SO THAT IS IN A WAY THE OBVIOUS 
TIME FOR HIM TO MAKE THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT.
>> WE HEARD THE SPEAKER TRIED 
TO ASSURE MEMBERS IN HIS OWN 
PARTY THAT THINGS WILL BE FINE. 
HOW DOES THIS MOVE IMPACT 
REPUBLICANS CHANCES IN THE 
MIDTERMS?
>> IT IS NOT BOOSTING 
CONFIDENCE FOR REPUBLICANS.  
THEY ARE KIND OF FACING 
HEADWINDS.  
IF NOT IT IS VERY
CHALLENGING YEAR FOR THEM WITH A
COULD HAVE A LANDSLIDE FOR 
DEMOCRATS COME NOVEMBER.  
SOME OF THAT DEPENDS ON SPEAKER 
RYAN.  
HE HAS BEEN A VERY STRONG 
FUNDRAISER FOR HIS PARTY.  
ONE OF THE STRONGEST REPUBLICAN 
LEADERS IN RECENT MEMORY.  
THAT HAS BEEN A BIG HELP TO 
REPUBLICANS.  
THE OTHER FACTOR IS THE 
PRESIDENT, HE HAS NOT BEEN SO 
HELPFUL ON THAT FRONT.  
WHETHER IT BE DOMINATING 
HEADLINES, NOT FOCUSING ON 
SELLING THE TAX REFORM BILL, 
THINGS LIKE THAT.  
RANK AND FILE REPUBLICANS ARE 
NOT TAKING THIS NEWS -- THEY 
ARE NOT SURPRISED BUT THEY ARE 
NOT THRILLED BY IT BECAUSE THEY 
WOULD RATHER SPEAKER RYAN BE 
WITH THEM ON THEIR SIDE 
FUNDRAISING FOR THEM. 
THEY ARE A LITTLE WORRIED NOW 
THAT HE IS STEPPING OUT. 
>> IN TERMS OF WHO MAY BE NEXT, 
WE KNOW KEVIN MCCARTHY AND 
STEVE SCALISE ARE REPORTEDLY 
GOING TO LIVE FOR THE ROLE.  
DOES EITHER HAVE A CLEAR 
ADVANTAGE?
>> NOT NECESSARILY. 
OBVIOUSLY KEVIN MCCARTHY HAS 
TRIED TO MAKE THE MOVE BEFORE 
BUT NOW HAS A BETTER GRASP ON 
THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE.
STEVE SCALISE, HAS A LOT OF 
SUPPORTERS, IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE IF THEY BOTH 
ACTUALLY GO FOR IT OR IF THEY 
TRY TO CUT A DEAL BETWEEN THE 
TWO OF THEM.  
THEY HAVE WORKED SO CLOSELY 
TOGETHER.  BUT WILL THE SPIRIT 
OF COOPERATION RAIN OR WILL 
PERSONAL AMBITION TAKE OVER?  
THAT IS WHAT WE WILL BE 
WATCHING.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP VOWING TO 
STRIKE SYRIA, AS A CANDIDATE HE 
CRITICIZED OFFICIALS FOR 
TELEGRAPHING MILITARY MOVES.  
ISN'T THAT WHAT HE DID TODAY?
>> THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT DID.  
HE DIDN'T QUITE GIVE US THE DATE
AND TIME OR LOCATION BUT HE 
MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR -- ON 
MONDAY HE SAID HE WOULD MAKE A 
DECISION, THAT CLOCK HAS 
EXPIRED, IT IS VERY CLEAR THE 
PRESIDENT WANTS TO TAKE 
MILITARY ACTION.  
THAT IS TELEGRAPHING, DOING 
EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID HE DID NOT 
WANT TO DO AS A CANDIDATE.  
WHAT THE POTENTIAL STRIKE LOOKS 
LIKE, WHO ELSE IS INVOLVED, 
THOSE ARE THE PURE ON THE TABLE.
JUST HOW LARGE A SCALE IT BACK 
WITHIN CONCERT WITH WHICH 
PARTNERS, THAT IS THE NATURE OF 
THIS
DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW.  
IT COULD BE ANYTHING FROM TODAY 
TO SOMETIME THIS WEEKEND.  
THE PRESIDENT CANCELING HIS 
TRIP TO MONITOR THE SITUATION.  
SOMETIME IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS HE WILL SEE SOME SORT OF 
ACTION.
>> TAKE THE TEMPERATURE, THE 
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LAST WEEK, 
HOW HAVE THEY IMPACTED THE 
PRESIDENT'S ROSE WITH VLADIMIR 
PUTIN?
>> THAT IS NOT THE CASE RIGHT 
NOW.  
THERE IS NOT A RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES AND THE PRESIDENT 
OF RUSSIA.  
THE UNITED STATES IS ON THE 
BRINK OF BOMBING ONE OF HIS 
CLOSEST ALLIES IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST.  
THERE HAVE BEEN NEW SANCTIONS 
OVER ELECTION HACKING. 
ALL OF THAT IS BUILDING 
TENSIONS BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT 
AND VLADIMIR PUTIN.  IN CASES 
LIKE THIS FOR ALL THE PRESIDENT
'S GOOD INTENTIONS HE DOES NOT 
HAVE THAT MUCH OF A CHOICE.  
SOMETHING LIKE A CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS ATTACK CANNOT GO 
IGNORED.  
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS 
HAPPENING HERE.  
THAT IS SORT OF WHAT WE ARE 
SEEING IN THE TWEETS FROM THE 
PRESIDENT.  
HE IS SAYING, YOU ARE FORCING 
ME TO DO THIS.  
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR 
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A BETTER 
RELATIONSHIP BUT RIGHT NOW 
TENSIONS ARE MORE HEATED.
>> ON TUESDAY SARAH SANDERS 
SAID PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVES 
HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO FIRE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER. 
WHAT HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE FROM 
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE?
>> THE FIRST THING YOU WILL 
HEAR IS FROM THE LAWYERS, WHO 
SAY, REGULATIONS SAY ONLY ROD 
ROSENSTEIN HAS THE AUTHORITY TO 
FIRE ROBERT MUELLER.  
THAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU 
WILL HEAR.  
THE WHITE HOUSE CONTENDS THAT 
DOES NOT APPLY TO THE PRESIDENT.
THEY ARE STILL SORTING THROUGH 
THAT LEGAL RATIONALE, WORKING 
ON THAT INTERNALLY. 
ON CAPITOL HILL DEMOCRATS AND 
REPUBLICANS ARE TELLING THE 
PRESIDENT DON'T DO THIS.  
YOU MAY NOT LIKE THE GUY,
BUT YOU OPEN A CAN OF WORMS IF 
YOU WERE TO FIRE THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL.  
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT IS 
GOING TO
END UP.  
IT DOES NOT END UP ANYWHERE 
GOOD.  
IT COULD POTENTIALLY MEAN 
IMPEACHMENT, IT WILL CREATE 
MORE LEGAL LIABILITY FOR YOU.  
LAWMAKERS ON CAPITOL HILL 
POTENTIALLY TRYING TO PROTECT 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL, WILL THAT 
PASS?  
CANNOT PASS?  
THAT -- CAN THAT PASS?  
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  
THAT CERTAINLY IS THE NATURE OF 
THE DISCUSSION.
>> REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS 
JOINING THAT CHORUS.  
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>>> MARK ZUCKERBERG IS BACK ON 
CAPITOL HILL FOR A 2ND ROUND OF 
GRILLING FROM LAWMAKERS.  
TODAY HE IS TESTIFYING BETWEEN 
THE HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE 
COMMITTEE.  
HE FACED HOURS OF QUESTIONING 
YESTERDAY. 
FACEBOOK IS A FACING GROWING 
PRESSURE TO PROTECT USER'S 
PRIVACY.  
HERE IS MARK ZUCKERBERG BEING 
QUESTIONED IT TODAY.
>> YOU HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO 
AUDIT DEVELOPERS FACEBOOK USER. 
THE PROBLEM AT FACEBOOK IT 
PROLIFERATED, IN FACT, 
RELATIVES TO OTHER TYPES OF 
PROBLEMS YOU HAD ON YOUR 
PLATFORM IT SEEMS AS THOUGH YOU 
TURNED A BLIND EYE TO THIS, 
CORRECT?
>> I DISAGREE WITH THAT 
ASSESSMENT.  
I THINK GOING FORWARD WE NEED 
TO TAKE A MORE PROACTIVE TO VIEW
OF POLICING WHAT THE DEVELOPERS 
DO.  
BUT LOOKING BACK, WE INVESTIGATE
-- 
>> IT SEEMS TO US LIKE YOU WERE 
MORE CONCERNED WITH THE 
ATTRACTING AND RETAINING 
DEVELOPERS ON YOUR PLATFORM 
THEN YOU WERE WITH ENSURING THE 
SECURITY OF FACEBOOK USER DATA. 
THERE IS A REAL TRUST GAP HERE. 
THIS DEVELOPER DATA ISSUE IS 
ONE EXAMPLE BUT WHY SHOULD WE 
TRUST YOU TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON 
THESE PROMISES WHEN YOU HAVE 
DEMONSTRATED THAT YOU ARE 
WILLING -- WHEN THE NEED TO 
SUITS YOU. 
>> CONGRESSMAN I DISAGREE WITH 
THAT CHARACTERIZATION.  
WE HAVE HAD A REVIEW PROCESS 
FOR YEARS.  
WE HAVE REVIEWED TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF APPS A YEAR AND 
TAKEN ACTION AGAINST A NUMBER 
OF THEM.  
THE PROCESS WAS NOT ENOUGH TO 
CATCH A DEVELOPER -- 
>> I SEE MY TIME IS ALMOST OVER.
TO MY MIND THE ONLY WAY WE 
CLOSE THIS TRUST GAP IS THROUGH 
LEGISLATION THAT EMPOWERS US.  
WE NEED TO PROTECT THE DIGITAL 
PRIVACY AND ENSURE THAT 
COMPANIES PROTECT OUR USERS 
DATA.
>> I WANT TO BRING IN OUR PANEL 
NOW.
THANK YOU AGAIN.  
HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE 
TODAY'S QUESTIONING VERSUS 
YESTERDAY?
>> DEFINITELY IT IS A CHANGE, 
THE SENATE -- WE FELT LIKE A 
LOT OF THE SENATORS WERE NOT 
PREPARED.  
IT SEEMED LIKE MARK ZUCKERBERG 
WAS IN CONTROL BUT TODAY THINGS 
ARE DIFFERENT.
>> THE QUESTION WE JUST HEARD 
ABOUT DEVELOPERS VERSUS USERS 
IS A PERTINENT QUESTION BECAUSE 
IT DOES OFTEN SEEM
THE APP DEVELOPERS TAKE A BIG 
ROLE ON FACEBOOK.  CAN SOMEONE 
EXPLAIN WHAT IS THE 
RELATIONSHIP OF FACEBOOK TO 
THESE DEVELOPERS?
>> THE HISTORIC RELATIONSHIP IS 
THAT YOU CAN ACCESS A 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DATA USING 
THE APPLICATION PROGRAMMING 
INTERFACE, EVERY MODULE IN 
FACEBOOK, WHETHER IT IS 
MESSENGER, NEWS FEED EVENTS, 
HAS ONE OF THESE APPLICATION 
PROGRAM INTERFACE.  
THEY PROVIDE DATA TO DIFFERENT 
COMPONENTS OF FACEBOOK.  IT IS 
REAL EASY TO LIFT DATA USING 
THOSE APIS AND PUT THAT INTO 
YOUR OWN DATABASE.
>> DOES FACEBOOK MAKE MONEY OFF 
OF THESE APPS?  
WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE TO HAVING 
ALL OF THESE APPS ON FACEBOOK?
>> IT REALLY FUELED THE GROWTH 
OF THE PLATFORM BECAUSE 
MARKETERS FOR THE FIRST TIME 
HAD ACCESS TO ALL KINDS OF 
DEMOGRAPHICS, INFORMATION, THEY 
WANTED TO BUILD THE PRODUCTS 
BASED OFF THE FACEBOOK API.  
THEY WERE ABLE TO GET IN FRONT 
-- THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET 
THIS MUCH INFORMATION FROM 
ANYONE ELSE.  
I THINK IT WAS THAT
RELATIONSHIP THAT REALLY FUELED 
FACEBOOK'S GROWTH.
>> GOING FORWARD WILL THE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE APPS HAVE 
TO CHANGE? 
>> IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A 
PROBLEM HERE. 
THEY ARE TAKING THE STEPS IN 
THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT, THEY 
STILL HAVE THESE RELATIONSHIPS 
WITH APP DEVELOPERS.  
THEY ARE STILL A IMPORTANT PART 
OF FACEBOOK'S BUSINESS MODEL.
>> IS ARE GOING TO BE 
REGULATION?  
MARK ZUCKERBERG APPEARS TO BE 
OPEN TO IT.  
DO YOU THINK THAT HE WANTS TO 
HAVE CONGRESS ALLOW HIM TO SELF 
REGULATE?
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
IT WOULD BE THE BEST SOLUTION 
NOT JUST FOR MR. ZUCKERBERG BUT 
FOR ALL SILICON VALLEY 
COMPANIES.  
IT IS NOT REALISTIC.  WE DO 
KNOW THAT MR. ZUCKERBERG HAS 
EXPRESSED A DESIRE FOR SELF 
REGULATION
AND FOR GOVERNMENT REGULATION.  
AT THE SAME TIME HE HAS HIS OWN 
LOBBYIST IN WASHINGTON WORKING 
TO WORK ON THE HONEST ADS ACT.  
SO THEY CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.
>> ONE THING I FEEL HAS NOT 
BEEN ADDRESSED, IS WHAT 
ACTUALLY HAPPENS TO THIS DATA 
ONCE IT IS OUT THERE.  
IT HAS ALL BEEN SOLD TO 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA, WHERE IS 
IT NOW?  
HE HAS NOT TALKED ABOUT THAT.
>> AGAIN, THE API, SINCE THE 
BEGINNING WAS VERY OPEN. 
ONCE A DAY THERE WAS ON THE 
APPS THEY WERE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD 
IT, ONCE DATA IS OUTSIDE OF THE 
DOOR IT IS OUT.
>> NOW HE IS SAYING THERE ARE 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF APPS THEY 
ARE LOOKING AT.  
SO -- IT SEEMS LIKE THE TIP OF 
THE ICEBERG.
>> WHAT REALLY HAS BEEN 
HIGHLIGHTED IS FACEBOOK IS NOT 
DOING ANY WORK TO DO AN AUDIT.  
ARE YOU ACTUALLY CONTROLLING 
THE DATA?  
ARE YOU DOING WHAT YOU SAID 
WITH IT?  
AGAIN, THE WORK OF JOURNALISTS 
IN THE UK REALLY HIGHLIGHTED 
THIS WOULD CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA.
>> YOU SAW THAT -- FACEBOOK 
TOOK CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA AT AT 
ITS WORD THAT IT DELETED ITS 
INFORMATION WHEN ACTUALLY IT 
DIDN'T.
>> WE HEARD MARK ZUCKERBERG SAY 
THEY TOOK THE INFORMATION THAT 
HE HAD GATHERED ON HIS APP, 
WHICH HE WAS ALLOWED TO DO, 
THEN HE SOLD IT TO CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTIA WHICH MARK ZUCKERBERG 
SAYS HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO DO. 
THAT VIOLATED THE AGREEMENT 
THEY HAD.  
SO IS FACEBOOK GOING TO SUE 
CROGHAN?
>> HE WAS ASKED THAT QUESTION.  
HE DID NOT REALLY SAY -- HE 
WOULD NOT COMMIT EITHER WAY.  
I THINK IT DOES SPEAK TO THE 
PRIORITIES ON THE MIND OF MARK 
ZUCKERBERG.  
GOING AFTER THAT, HAVING THIS 
BLOWUP EVEN FURTHER IS
NOT WHAT HE WANTS.
>> THE PLATFORM WAS DESIGNED IN 
SUCH A WAY SO IT WOULD BE EASY 
TO EXTRACT DATA SO THAT NOT 
JUST FACEBOOK WOULD GROW BUT WE 
REMEMBER APPS -- SO THAT 
DEVELOPERS COULD GROW USING 
FACEBOOK DATA AS WELL.  
FOR THEM TO SAY THEY TOLD US 
THEY DELETED IT, NO, THE ENTIRE 
SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED FOR THIS 
TYPE OF SCALE.
>> WHICH RELATIONSHIP IS MORE 
IMPORTANT?  
IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST. 
>> IT IS CLEAR GROWTH OF THE 
PLATFORM WAS PARAMOUNT IN HIS 
MIND.  
PRIVACY HAS BECOME A LIVE DEAL 
BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME PUBLIC 
BUT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT 
THE GROWTH. 
>> HE DID NOT REALLY FULLY 
COMMUNICATE ABOUT THE FTC 
ENFORCEMENT.  
IT SEEMS LIKE HE IS FOCUSED ON 
THE GROWTH, HE HAS NOT REALLY 
LOOK AT ALL THE RISKS AND 
ENFORCEMENT, HE NEEDS TO PAY 
ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING.
>> DO YOU THINK THAT WAS 
GENUINE WHEN HE DID NOT KNOW 
ABOUT THESE CASES?
>> HE HAS A STATUTORY 
REQUIREMENT TO TELL THE TRUTH.
>> SO, HE DID NOT KNOW ABOUT 
THESE CASES?
>> I ALSO DON'T THINK HE PAYS 
THAT MUCH ATTENTION TO IT.
>> IT IS NOT ON HIS PRIORITY 
LIST.
>> LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE TODAY.  
LOOK AT HOW THE COMPANY IS RUN.
>> ONE CONGRESSWOMAN POINTED 
THAT OUT TODAY.  SHE SUGGESTED 
FINANCIAL PENALTIES WOULD MAKE 
IT MORE OF A PRIORITY.  
DO YOU THINK THAT IS WHAT HAS 
TO HAPPEN?
>> DEFINITELY THE FTC HAS HAD 
CERTAIN TOOLS TO ENFORCE 
COMPANIES TO FOLLOW THE RULES.  
SO, IT IS UNCLEAR IF THERE WERE 
ANY FINANCIAL PENALTIES FROM 
THE FTC SO, I THINK, YEAH, 
ABSOLUTELY HAVING A FINANCIAL 
PENALTY. 
THAT SAID, THIS COMPANY MAKES 
IT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
>> THEY COULD THINK OF THESE AS 
INCENTIVES.
>> TIED TO THEIR BONUSES. 
>> MARK ZUCKERBERG IS 
INCREDIBLY WEALTHY. 
ONE BILLION-DOLLAR ENFORCEMENT 
ACTION, I DON'T EVEN THINK HE 
PAYS ATTENTION TO SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT.
>> WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK IN 
AND LISTEN.  
THANK YOU SO MUCH.  
DON'T GO AWAY WE ARE GOING TO 
RESUME THE HEARING.
>> THE GENTLEMAN TIME HAS 
EXPIRED. 
-- THE GENTLE MAN'S TIME HAS 
EXPIRED.  
WE WILL HAVE A VOTE AT 1:40 WE 
WILL CONTINUE THE HEARING AFTER 
A BRIEF BREAK.  
LET'S GO NOW TO THE DOCTOR.
>> THANK YOU.  
THERE ARE PLENTY OF EXAMPLES, 
INCLUDING FROM FAMILY MEMBERS 
OF MINE WHERE PEOPLE WILL BE
VERBALLY DISCUSSING ITEMS NEVER 
HAVING BEEN ON THE INTERNET AT 
THE TIME, THEN THE NEXT TIME 
THEY GET ON FACEBOOK OR OTHER 
ONLINE APPS, ADS FOR THINGS 
THAT THEY WERE VERBALLY 
DISCUSSING WITH EACH OTHER WILL 
SHOW UP.
I KNOW YOU SAID IN THE SENATE 
THAT FACEBOOK DOES NOT LISTEN 
SPECIFICALLY TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE 
SAYING THROUGH
THEIR PHONE, WHETHER THAT IS A 
GOOGLE PHONE OR IN APPLE.  
HOWEVER THE OTHER DAY MY MOTHER-
IN-LAW WAS DISCUSSING HER 
BROTHER WHO HAD BEEN DECEASED 
FOR TEN YEARS, LATER THAT 
EVENING ON HER FACBOOK SITE 
SHE HAD IT SET TO MUSIC, A 
PICTURE COLLAGE THAT CAME UP ON 
FACEBOOK SPECIFICALLY TO HER 
BROTHER.  
SO, IF YOU ARE NOT LISTENING TO 
US ON THE PHONE, WHO IS?  
DO YOU HAVE SPECIFIC CONTRACTS 
WITH THESE COMPANIES THAT WILL 
PROVIDE
DATA THAT IS BEING ACQUIRED 
VERBALLY THROUGH OUR PHONES OR 
NOW THROUGH THINGS LIKE ALEXA 
OR OTHER PRODUCTS?
>> CONGRESSMAN WE ARE NOT 
COLLECTING ANY INFORMATION 
VERBALLY.  
THE ONLY TIME WE MIGHT USE THE 
MICROPHONE IS WHEN YOU ARE 
RECORDING A VIDEO OR DOING 
SOMETHING WHERE YOU ARE TRYING 
TO RECORD AUDIO.  
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING THAT IS TRYING TO 
LISTEN TO WHAT IS GOING ON.
>> LIKE I SAID, MY SON WHO 
LIVES IN CHICAGO, HE AND HIS 
FRIENDS ARE TALKING ABOUT A 
CERTAIN TYPE OF SUIT BECAUSE 
THEY ARE BUSINESS GUYS, THE 
NEXT DAY THEY HAD A BUNCH OF ADS
ABOUT BUSINESS SUITS.  
IT IS OBVIOUS SOMEONE IS 
LISTENING TO THE AUDIO ON OUR 
PHONES.  
I SEE THAT AS A BIG ISSUE.  
YOU MAY NOT BE BUT, FOR EXAMPLE 
IF YOU ARE IN YOUR DOCTOR'S 
OFFICE, IN A BOARD ROOM, OR 
EVEN PERSONAL AREAS OF YOUR 
HOME, THAT IS POTENTIALLY AN 
ISSUE.  
I AM SKEPTICAL THAT SOMEONE 
ISN'T LISTENING.  
I SEE THIS AS AN INDUSTRYWIDE 
ISSUE THAT YOU COULD
POTENTIALLY HELP TO ADDRESS.  
THE FINAL THING, WHEN YOU HAVE 
AN EXECUTIVE SESSION AND YOU 
HAVE DECISIONS TO BE MADE, DO 
YOU ALLOW THE PEOPLE IN THE 
ROOM TO HAVE THEIR PHONES ON 
THEM?
>> CONGRESSMAN, WE DO.  
AGAIN, I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH 
FACEBOOK DOESN'T DO THIS, I AM 
NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY
COMPANIES THAT DO EITHER.  
MY UNDERSTANDING IS A LOT OF 
THESE CASES YOU ARE TALKING 
ABOUT ARE A COINCIDENCE OR 
SOMEONE MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT 
SOMETHING BUT THEY ALSO GO TO A 
WEBSITE ON FACEBOOK BECAUSE 
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IT.  
THEN MAYBE THEY WILL SEE THE AD 
BECAUSE OF THAT.
>> IF THAT IS THE CASE -- I 
KNOW FOR CONVENIENCE COMPANIES 
HAVE DEVELOPED THINGS, BUT, IT 
JUST SEEMS TO ME
THAT THE POINT OF THOSE 
PRODUCTS IS NOT JUST FOR YOUR 
OWN CONVENIENCE BUT WHEN YOU 
ARE VERBALLY TALKING ABOUT
THINGS, THEY ARE ABLE TO 
COLLECT INFORMATIN ON THE TYPE 
OF ACTIVITIES THAT YOU ARE 
ENGAGING IN.  
I WOULD IMPLORE THE INDUSTRY TO 
LOOK INTO THAT AND MAKE SURE IN 
ADDITION TO PHYSICAL EXPLORING 
THE INTERNET AND COLLECTING DATA
THAT DATA BEING TAKEN VERBALLY 
NOT BE ALLOWED.  
THANK YOU.
>> CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
GENTLEMAN FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
>> THANK YOU.  
YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE FRAMING OF 
YOUR TESTIMONY ABOUT PRIVACY, 
YOU HAVE SAID YESTERDAY AND 
TODAY
THAT USERS OWN ALL OF THE DATA. 
I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE TALK 
ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT.  THAT 
INCLUDES THE INFORMATION THAT 
FACEBOOK REQUIRES USERS TO MAKE 
PUBLIC.  
CAN ADVERTISES -- UNDERSTANDING 
FACEBOOK MAINTAIN THE DATA, BUT,
ADVERTISERS END UP HAVING ACCESS
THROUGH ITS AGREEMENTS WITH YOU.
CAN ADVERTISERS USE NONPUBLIC 
DATA?  
DATA THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH THE 
THINK IS PUBLIC SO THAT THEY 
CAN TARGET THEIR ADS?
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, -- SYRIA, 
LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A BUSINESS 
SELLING SKIS, -- CONGRESSMAN, 
LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A BUSINESS 
SELLING SKIS, WE DON'T TELL THE 
ADVERTISER THAT HERE IS A LIST 
OF PEOPLE THAT LIKE SKIS, THEY 
JUST SAY, WE ARE TRYING TO SELL 
SKIS CAN YOU REACH PEOPLE THAT 
SELL SKIS, THEN WE MATCH THAT 
UP ON OUR SIDE.
>> UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY GET 
ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION.  
THE DATA THAT IS ASSESSABLE TO 
THEM DOES FACEBOOK INCLUDE 
DELETED DATA?
>> CONGRESSMAN, NO.  
I WOULD PUSH BACK ON THE IDEA 
THAT WE ARE GIVING THEM ACCESS 
TO THE DATA.  
WE ALLOW THEM TO REACH PEOPLE 
BUT WE ARE NOT GIVING THEM 
ACCESS.
>> THAT IS FAIR.  
CAN ADVERTISERS GET ACCESS OR 
USE THE METADATA THAT FACEBOOK 
COLLECTS IN ORDER TO TARGET
ADS?  
THAT WOULD INCLUDE -- I KNOW 
YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW 
FACEBOOK WOULD USE ACCESSED 
INFORMATION FOR FOLKS
-- I MIGHT BE ABLE TO OPT IN OR 
OUT ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO TRACK 
ME TO OTHER WEBSITES.  
IS THAT USED BY THOSE 
ADVERTISERS AS WELL?
>> CONGRESSMAN I'M NOT SURE I 
UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION.
>> ESSENTIALLY DOES THE 
ADVERTISERS THAT ARE USING YOUR 
PLATFORM, TO THEY GET ACCESS TO 
INFORMATION THAT THE USER DOES 
NOT ACTUALLY THINK IS BEING 
GENERATED OR PUBLIC, 
UNDERSTANDING THAT IF YOU DIVE 
INTO THE DETAILS OF YOUR 
PLATFORM USERS MIGHT BE ABLE TO 
SHUT THAT OFF.  
BUT THE CHALLENGE IS THERE IS A 
LOT OF INFORMATION THAT IS 
GENERATED THAT PEOPLE DON'T 
THINK THEY ARE GENERATING.
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE 
TARGETING OPTIONS THAT ARE 
AVAILABLE FOR ADVERTISERS ARE 
THINGS THAT ARE BASED ON WHAT 
PEOPLE SHARE.  
ONCE IN ADVERTISER TO THIS IS 
HOW THEY WANT TO TARGET 
SOMETHING FACEBOOK ALSO DOES 
ITS OWN WORK TO HELP DETERMINE 
WHICH ADS WILL BE INTERESTING 
TO WHICH PEOPLE.  
SO WE MAY USE BEHAVIORS OF WHAT 
YOU HAVE SHOWN YOU ARE 
THE SYSTEMS MORE RELEVANT TO 
YOU.  
BUT THAT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT 
THAN GIVING THAT AS AN OPTION 
TO AN ADVERTISER.
>> I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS 
IS I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW USES 
OWN THAT DATA.  
ALSO, YOU FOCUSED YOUR 
TESTIMONY ON THE INDIVIDUAL 
PRIVACY ASPECT THAT WE HAVE NOT 
TALKED ABOUT THE SOCIETAL 
IMPLICATION.  
WHILE I APPLAUD SOME OF YOUR 
REFORMS THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT 
YOUR PLATFORM HAS BECOME A MIX 
OF NEWS, ENTERTAINMENT, SOCIAL 
MEDIA,
THAT IS UP FOR MANIPULATION.  
WE HAVE SEEN THAT.  
IF THE CHANGES TO INDIVIDUAL 
PRIVACY AREN'T SUFFICIENT -- 
>> TIME IS EXPIRED.  
CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE GENTLEMAN 
FROM TEXAS.
>> THE ACTIVITIES OF FACEBOOK 
AND OTHER COMPANIES SHOULD NOT 
SURPRISE US.  
WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE.  
WE SAW A MONOPOLY IN THE LATE 
18 HUNDREDS, WE SAW A LARGE 
COMPANY BECOME A NEAR MONOPOLY 
IN THE 60s, JUST AS FACEBOOK
-- THESE COMPANIES WERE FOUNDED 
BY BRIGHT PEOPLE, THEIR 
COMPANIES GREW, EVENTUALLY THEY 
SOMETIMES BECAME DETACHED FROM 
EVERYDAY AMERICANS.  
WHAT HAPPENED IS POLICYMAKERS 
HAD TO STEP IN AND WE 
ESTABLISHED THE BALANCE
BETWEEN THOSE PEOPLE AND 
EVERYDAY AMERICANS.  
YOU DID NOT INTEND FOR THIS TO 
HAPPEN.  I 
APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE 
APOLOGIZED FOR IT.  
IT APPEARS YOU ARE TRYING TO 
ADDRESS THE SITUATION.  JUST AS 
WE ADDRESSED THOSE MONOPOLIES 
IN THE PAST WE ARE FACED WITH 
THAT SITUATION TODAY.  WE NEED 
-- THIS GOES BEYOND FACEBOOK.  
THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE SOCIAL 
MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS, BACK TO 
FACEBOOK WE HEARD EXAMPLES 
YESTERDAY DURING THE HEARING, 
ABOUT IDEOLOGICAL BIAS AMONG 
USERS OF FACEBOOK AND MY TEXAS 
DISTRICT I HAD A RETIRED SCHOOL 
TEACHER WHOSE POSTINGS WERE 
BANNED OR STOPPED, THE GOOD 
NEWS IS I WAS ABLE TO WORK WITH 
FACEBOOK'S PERSONNEL TO GET HER 
REINSTATED.  
THAT SAID THEY STILL SEEM TO BE 
TRYING TO STOP HER POSTINGS.  
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO IN THAT 
REGARD TO FIX THAT BIAS WILL GO 
A LONG WAY.  
I WANT TO GO IN A DIFFERENT 
DIRECTION AND TALK ABOUT THE 
FUTURE. 
CONGRESS NEEDS TO CONSIDER 
POLICY RESPONSES IN I WANT TO 
CALL THIS POLICY RESPONSE 
PRIVACY 2.0.  
I THINK THE TECHNOLOGY 
COMPANIES SHOULD BE IDEOLOGY 
DIAGNOSTIC REGARDING THESE 
ACTIVITIES.  
THE ONLY EXCEPTION WOULD BE FOR 
VIOLENT BEHAVIOR.  
MY QUESTION IS, DO YOU AGREE 
THAT FACEBOOK SHOULD BE 
IDEOLOGICALLY NEUTRAL?
>> CONGRESSMAN I AGREE WE 
SHOULD BE A PLATFORM FOR ALL 
IDEAS.
>> GOOD.  
I HAVE GOT LIMITED TIME.  
WITH RESPECT TO PRIVACY WE NEED 
TO SET A BASELINE.  
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A VIRTUAL 
PERSON, THEIR NAME, ADDRESS, 
ONLINE PURCHASES, WEBSITES IS 
IT DID, I THINK -- MY SECOND 
QUESTION IS, YOU SAID EARLIER 
EACH USER OWNS THEIR OWN 
PRESENCE, DO YOU THINK THIS 
CONCEPT SHOULD APPLY TO ALL 
TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS?
>> CONGRESSMAN, YES, I THINK 
PEOPLE OWNER --
>> I AM NOT TRYING TO CUT YOU 
OFF.  
IN THIS REGARD I BELIEVE 
CONGRESS -- IF CONGRESS ENACTS 
PRIVACY STANDARDS
JUST AS WE HAVE FOR FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS, THE POLICY SHOULD 
STATE THAT THE DATA OF 
TECHNOLOGY USER SHOULD BE HELD 
PRIVATELY UNLESS THEY CONSENT 
TO THE USE OF THE DATA BY 
OTHERS.  
THIS RELEASE SHOULD BE BASED ON 
TRANSPARENCY AS TO WHAT DATA 
WILL BE USED.
>> YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
MARK ZUCKERBERG ANSWER QUESTIONS
DURING DAY TWO OF HIS HEARING.  
THE SESSION IS GOING TO BREAK 
SOON.  
WE ARE GOING TO GET YOU CAUGHT 
UP ON THE REST OF THE DAYS 
NEWS.  
A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS 
IS MOVING TO PROTECT SPECIAL 
COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER.  
THE LEGISLATION COMES AFTER THE 
FED THE RATED
MICHAEL COHEN.  
DONALD TRUMP THEN LASHED OUT AT 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL CALLING THE 
RAID A "ATTACK ON OUR COUNTRY." 
HE HAS ALSO CALL THE 
INVESTIGATION "A WITCH HUNT."  
PAULA REED JOINS US NOW FROM 
THE WHITE HOUSE. 
YESTERDAY YOUR QUESTION AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING MADE 
A LOT OF NEWS.  
LET'S LISTEN TO IT.
>> YOU SAID THE PRESIDENT 
BELIEVES HE HAS THE POWER TO 
FIRE ROBERT MUELLER.
>> I KNOW A NUMBER OF 
INDIVIDUALS IN THE LEGAL 
COMMUNITY THAT HE HAS THE POWER 
TO DO SO.  
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER 
ANNOUNCEMENTS.
>> SO WHY DOES HE WHITE HOUSE 
NOW THINK THE PRESIDENT CAN'T 
HIRE MUELLER?
>> REPORTER:  THEY WEREN'T 
REALLY CLEAR ON WHAT THEIR 
LEGAL THEORY IS.  
THE GENERAL UNDERSTANDING IS 
ONLY ROD ROSENSTEIN CAN FIRE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL.  
HE IS THE ONE WHO APPOINTED THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL.  
SO IT WAS CERTAINLY NEWS WHEN 
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THEY 
BELIEVED HE HAD THIS POWER.  
BUT THIS GOT A LOT OF LEGAL 
SCHOLARS TALKING.
IT IS CLEAR THERE MAY BE SOME 
ROOM FOR HIM ON THIS.  
IF HE WAS TO ORDER ROD 
ROSENSTEIN TO FIRE MUELLER AND 
HE DECLINED HE CAN GO DOWN THE 
LINE IN SUCCESSION TO TRY TO 
GET SOMEONE ELSE TO FIRE HIM.  
ONE OTHER THEORY IS HE COULD 
ORDER JEFF SESSIONS, TO DISSOLVE
THE REGULATION THAT PROVIDES 
FOR A SPECIAL COUNSEL.  
THAT IS ONE OF THE LEGAL 
THEORIES OUT THERE AS TO HOW 
THE PRESIDENT COULD POSSIBLY 
GET RID OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. 
IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN IF THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD AGREE 
WITH THAT.
>> WHAT ABOUT ROD ROSENSTEIN, 
HOW DOES THE PRESIDENT VIEW HIS 
ROLE AT THIS POINT?
>> REPORTER:  NOT FONDLY, THE 
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS 
NEVER DIRECTLY RESPONDED TO THE 
CRITICISM OF THE PRESIDENT.  
IT WAS A NEW PHASE THIS WEEK 
WITH THE RAID OF THE ATTORNEY.  
THOSE ARE BASED ON EVIDENCE 
THAT WAS UNCOVERED IN THE 
RUSSIA PROBE BUT IT DOES NOT 
FALL UNDER MUELLER'S 
RESPONSIBILITY SO THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL ALLOWED THAT EVIDENCE 
TO BE PASSED ALONG TO A SEPARATE
U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN NEW 
YORK.  
THE FACT THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN IS 
NOT ONLY INVOLVED IN THE RUSSIA 
PROBE BUT INVOLVED IN THIS 
SECOND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 
INTO THE PRESIDENT'S IN A CIRCLE
 
ABOUT THAT.  
LEGALLY SPEAKING IT DOES NOT 
APPEAR THAT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY 
GENERAL HAS DONE ANYTHING WRONG.
HE IS THE ONE WHO IS OVERSEEING 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL.  
IT IS HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO 
HANDLE ANY OF THE EVIDENCE AND 
DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH IT.  
ALSO HE OVERSEES THE OPERATIONS 
OF THE ENTIRE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT.  
SO IT DOES -- SO IT IS NOT 
SURPRISING THAT HE WOULD BE 
INVOLVED.
>> MANY REPUBLICANS ARE WARNING 
THE PRESIDENT THAT RETALIATING 
AGAINST ANY OFFICIAL WILL 
CREATE A BIGGER MESS.
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE 
PRESIDENT DOES FIRE HIM?
>> REPORTER:  IT DEPENDS ON HOW 
HE GOES ABOUT IT.  
IF HE WAS TO ORDER THE DEPUTY 
ATTORNEY GENERAL TO DO IT 
WITHOUT CAUSE, WHAT YOU MIGHT 
SEE IS AS YOU WORK YOUR WAY 
DOWN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION 
EVENTUALLY YOU DO GET TO SOME 
U.S. ATTORNEYS WHO MAY BE 
WILLING TO FIRE MUELLER.  
IT IS ALMOST GUARANTEED IT WILL 
WIND UP IN COURT. 
THAT MUELLER WOULD CHALLENGE 
THAT AUTHORITY.  
IF THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO DO IT 
YOU KNOW BATTERY, THAT WOULD 
ALMOST WIND UP IN COURT.  
IT WOULD BE EXPECTED THAT 
MUELLER WOULD CHALLENGE THAT.  
AGAIN, WE WILL ALL WIND UP
IN COURT.
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 
STORMY DANIELS.  
WE HAVE LEARNED SHE IS 
COOPERATING WITH INVESTIGATORS 
AFTER THE RAID, HOW SIGNIFICANT 
IS THIS DEVELOPMENT?
>> REPORTER:  LEGALLY SPEAKING 
NOT TERRIBLY SIGNIFICANT.  
BUT THE FACT THAT A STORMY 
DANIELS WHO HAD AN AFFAIR WITH 
THE PRESIDENT WAS PAID TO KEEP 
QUIET ABOUT THE FEAR, THE FACT 
THAT SHE IS NOT COOPERATING 
WITH INVESTIGATORS INTO THIS 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IS QUITE 
AN EXCITING HEADLINE BUT IT IS 
CERTAINLY TO BE EXPECTED.  SHE 
IS JUST IN CIVIL COURT 
CHALLENGING THE NATURE OF THIS 
NONDISCLOSURE, SHE WANTS TO 
SPEAK FREELY.
BUT IF THERE IS A CRIMINAL CASE 
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HER 
PERSONALLY, SHE CAN ACT AS A 
WITNESS, IT IS NOT SURPRISING 
SHE IS WILLING TO COOPERATE, 
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE IS NO LOVE 
LOST BETWEEN THAT TEAM AND 
MICHAEL COHEN.
>>> THANK YOU.  
PAUL RYAN ANNOUNCED TODAY HE 
WILL NOT BE SEEKING REELECTION 
AT THE END OF HIS TERM.  
WE HAVE MORE ON THE DECISION.
>> REPORTER:  PAUL RYAN 
ANNOUNCED HE WILL NOT SEEK 
REELECTION SO THAT HE CAN SPEND 
MORE TIME WITH HIS FAMILY.
>> IF I AM HERE ONE MORE TERM 
MY CHILDREN WILL ONLY HAVE EVER 
KNOWN ME AS A WEEKEND DAD.  
I JUST CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
>> REPORTER:  HE LEAVES 
CONGRESS WITH ACCOMPLISHMENT 
INCLUDING MAJOR REFORM OF THE 
TAX CODE.  
TODAY DONALD TRUMP TWEETED "
PAUL RYAN IS A TRULY GOOD MAN.  
HE WILL LEAVE A LEGACY OF 
ACHIEVEMENT THAT NO ONE CAN 
QUESTION."  
THE DECISION TO STEP AWAY COMES 
AT A TIME WHEN REPUBLICANS FACE 
UNCERTAINTY.
>> I REALLY DO NOT BELIEVE, 
WHETHER I STAY OR GO IN 2019 
WILL AFFECT A PERSON IS 
INDIVIDUAL RACE FOR CONGRESS.
>> REPORTER:  RYAN SERVED 20 
YEARS IN THE HOUSE.  
IN A CLOSED-DOOR MEETING TODAY 
HE RECEIVED A STANDING OVATION 
FROM COLLEAGUES AND EVEN SHED 
SOME TEARS.
>> HE ACHIEVED HIS ULTIMATE 
CAREER GOAL.  
WE THANK HIM FOR BEING AN 
OUTSTANDING LEADER.
>> REPORTER:  THE DEPARTURE 
OPENS THE DOOR FOR NEW 
LEADERSHIP AT KEVIN MCCARTHY 
AND STEVE SCALISE HE SEEMED AS 
FRONT RUNNERS.  
IN A STATEMENT THE SPEAKER SAID 
HE WILL SERVE OUT HIS FULL TERM,
AND RETIRE IN JANUARY.
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SENDING 
A WARNING TO RUSSIA AS HE PLANS 
A MILITARY STRIKE IN SYRIA.  
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED THIS 
MORNING "RUSSIA BOWS TO SHOOT 
DOWN ANY IT MET ALL MISSILES 
FIRED AT SYRIA, GET READY 
RUSSIA, BECAUSE THEY WILL BE 
COMING, NICE, NEW AND SMART.  
YOU SHOULD NOT BE PARTNERS WITH 
A GAS KILLING ANIMAL WHO KILLED 
HIS PEOPLE AND ENJOYS IT."  
DOZENS OF CIVILIANS, INCLUDING 
CHILDREN, DIED BUT RUSSIA HAS 
WARNED OF
"GRAVE REPERCUSSIONS" IF THE 
U.S. INTERVENES.
>> REPORTER:  WITH U.S. 
WARSHIPS MOVING INTO POSITION 
FOR A POSSIBLE MISSILE STRIKE 
AGAINST SYRIA THE PRESIDENT 
ISSUED A WARNING ON TWITTER 
THIS MORNING.  
"RUSSIA BOWS TO SHOOT DOWN ANY 
IT MET ALL MISSILES FIRED AT 
SYRIA.  
GET READY RUSSIA BECAUSE THEY 
WILL BE COMING, NICE, NEW AND 
SMART.  
YOU SHOULDN'T BE PARTNERS WITH 
A GAS KILLING ANIMAL WHO KILLS 
HIS PEOPLE AND ENJOYS IT."  
A SPOKESPERSON FROM RUSSIA SAYS 
"SMART MISSILES SHOULD BE 
FLYING TOWARDS TERRORIST
>> REPORTER:  NOT THE LEGAL 
GOVERNMENT THAT HAS BEEN 
FIGHTING TERRORISM."  
THE SOCIAL MEDIA BACK AND FORTH 
COMES AS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS 
BEEN CONSULTING WITH ITS ALLIES 
ON A JOINT MILITARY RESPONSE TO 
THE ALLEGED POISON GAS ATTACK.  
RUSSIA AND SYRIA DENIED THE 
ATTACK TOOK LACE BUT MORE THAN 
40 PEOPLE DIED FROM THE ASSAULT
THAT THE PRESIDENT CALLED 
"BARBARIC."  
SYRIA HAS INVITED INDEPENDENT 
EXPERTS TO INVESTIGATE.  
IT IS NOT CLEAR IF THAT VISIT 
MAY DELAY ANY MILITARY STRIKE ON
SYRIA.
>>> I WANT TO BRING IN DON, HE 
IS A FORMER INTELLIGENCE 
OFFICER.  
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING 
WITH US.  
WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE TWEET THE 
PENTAGON REFUSED TO COMMENT.  
IN A STATEMENT SAID "IT DOES 
NOT COMMENT ON POTENTIAL FUTURE 
MILITARY ACTIONS."  
DO WE THINK THE WHITE HOUSE IS 
ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THE 
PENTAGON?
>> I THINK YOU NEVER WANT TO 
SHARE YOUR MILITARY PLANS WITH 
YOUR FRIENDS, ALLIES OR YOUR 
FOES.  
THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE GIVES 
YOU THE BEST RESULTS IN ANY 
MILITARY ACTION YOU ARE TAKING. 
THOUGH THE PRESIDENT IS KNOWN 
FOR HIS SOCIAL MEDIA BUT BEHIND 
THE SCENES HE IS BEING BRIEFED, 
THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
SITTING IN ON THESE MEETINGS.  
THE PRESIDENT HAS CANCELED HIS 
TRIP, THEY ARE WORKING TOGETHER,
IT IS JUST THE WAY THE 
PRESIDENT COMMUNICATES.
>> IS THERE A CLEAR STRATEGY, 
IF THEY WERE TO BE MILITARY 
ACTION IS THERE A STRATEGY 
BEHIND THAT?
>> I WOULD HATE TO THINK THAT 
WE DON'T HAVE A CLEAR STRATEGY. 
WE HAVE GOT SOME GREAT MINDSS 
AT THE PENTAGON. 
I THINK THEY HAVE PLANNED FOR 
EVERY SCENARIO.  
THE GENERALS OVER THERE, THE 
ANALYST, THE PROFESSIONALS, 
THEY HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING 
THIS, JUST LIKE THEY HAVE FOR 
ANY PLAN THAT IS OUT THERE.  
I THINK THEY HAVE GOT IT UNDER 
CONTROL.  
WE ARE GOING TO JOIN FORCES 
WITH ALLIES, FRANCE, THE UK, 
ISRAEL, THEY ARE ALL COMING 
FORWARD TO SUPPORT US.  
THE ONLY ISSUE IS RUSSIA 
INTERFERES JUST AS THEY HAVE 
THE LAST 12 TIMES.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT RUSSIA FOR 
A MOMENT.  HOW GREAT OF A RISK 
IS THAT?
>> THERE IS ALWAYS THAT RISK.  
THERE IS SO MANY UNKNOWNS WHEN 
YOU DEAL WITH PEOPLE LIKE 
BASHAR AL-ASSAD AND VLADIMIR 
PUTIN.  
BUT PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN 
LIKES HIS PROMOTIONAL GAME VERY 
WELL.  
HE LIKES TO PORTRAY A CERTAIN 
IMAGE.  
IN THE LONG RUN HE WILL PUT OUT 
A LOT OF PROPAGANDA, HE WILL BE 
VERY STRONG IN HIS WORDS, BUT I 
THINK HE WILL DO THE RIGHT THING
AND HE WILL STAND BY BASHAR AL-
ASSAD AS LONG AS IT DOES NOT 
CREATE A RISK FOR HIM.
>> LAST YEAR THE PRESIDENT 
STOOD ALONE IN HIS STRIKE 
AGAINST SYRIA.  
NOW IT APPEARS BRITAIN AND 
FRANCE MAY BE CONSIDERING 
ACTION AS WELL.  
HOW IMPORTANT IS IT THAT THERE 
IS A JOINT RESPONSE?
>> A FEW WEEKS AGO THE BIG 
THING THE PRESIDENT CAME FORWARD
TALKING ABOUT IT WAS TIME FOR 
OTHER COUNTRIES TO STEP UP AND 
START PAYING THEIR PART.  
IT WAS ONE OF THE BIG THINGS HE 
SPOKE OF WITH NATO EARLY IN HIS 
PRESIDENCY.  
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD SIGN 
BECAUSE HE WAS THERE TO ALIGN 
WITH THE PRESIDENT, I BELIEVE 
IT WAS YESTERDAY OR THIS 
MORNING THE PRESIDENT SPOKE 
WITH THERESA MAY, ISRAEL IS ON 
BOARD, THAT SHOWS THAT THE 
WORLD IS KIND OF COME TOGETHER, 
THEY AGREE WHATEVER HAPPENS IN 
SYRIA -- THERE ARE A LOT OF 
MOVING PIECES BUT, CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS AGAINST YOUR PEOPLE, 
THAT IS JUST WRONG.  
IT SHOWS WHAT KIND OF PERSON WE 
ARE DEALING WITH. 
CIVIL WAR IS ONE THING, BUT, TO 
GAS AND POISON YOUR OWN CITIZENS
, THAT IS JUST A CRIME.
>> IT SEEMS TO PUT BACK ON A 
TIMELINE PULLING OUT OF SYRIA.  
LET'S IMAGINE THE U.S. DOES 
PULL OUT, THAT WOULD RESHAPE 
WHO HAS POWER IN THE COUNTRY.  
WHAT WOULD IT THEN LOOK LIKE IF 
RUSSIA AND IRAQ WERE LEFT IN 
CHARGE?
>> YOU ARE RIGHT, A FEW WEEKS 
AGO THE PRESIDENT WAS ADAMANT 
THAT IT WAS TIME TO PULL OUT.  
BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THAT 
NOW, THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE 
STTING AT THAT TABLE WOULD BE 
THE IRANIANS AND THE RUSSIANS, 
BEING THAT CLOAKS TO ISRAEL, -- 
BEING THAT CLOSE TO IS YOUR, WE 
DO NOT WANT TO WALK AWAY FROM 
THE TABLE.  
AROUND THE HOLIDAYS ALL THE 
FAMILY COMES TOGETHER, AS LONG 
AS THE SENIOR GRANDFATHER IS 
THERE PEOPLE TEND TO BEHAVE. 
LET'S LET UNCLE SAM BE THE 
SENIOR.
>> SO WHO IS ADVISING THE 
PRESIDENT AND HOW COULD HIS 
CABINET IMPACT DIPLOMACY IN 
THAT REGION?
>> FROM DAY ONE OF THE NEW 
CABINET WE HAVE SEEN HOW HE HAS 
RELIED ON GENERALS AND MILITARY 
LEADERS.  I THINK
THAT IS WHERE HE HAS HIS BEST 
GAME.  
WE HAVE GOT GENERAL KELLY, WE 
HAVE GOT MORE PIKE -- WE HAVE 
GOT MIKE POMPEO, JOHN BOLTON 
JUST STEPPED UP, THERE ARE SOME 
GREAT MINDS THERE.  úSO, I THIN 
TO THEM.  
THE PRESIDENT IN THE PAST HAS 
COME FORWARD, HE HAS VOICED HIS 
OPINION, BUT, IT ALWAYS SEEMS 
TO KIND OF DWINDLE DOWN OR 
FIZZLE, WHEN HE LISTENS TO THE 
GENERALS AND THE PEOPLE HE 
SELECTED FOR THESE POSTS.
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  
ALGERIA PRESIDENT HAS DECLARED 
THREE DAYS OF MOURNING TO 
REMEMBER THE HUNDREDS KILLED 
THE TODAY IN AN AIRPLANE CRASH. 
MORE THAN 250 PEOPLE WERE 
KILLED WHEN A MILITARY AIRPLANE 
WENT DOWN
20 MILES SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL.  
THIS IS CONSIDERED THE WORST 
AIR DISASTER IN THAT COUNTRY.
>> REPORTER:  THIS IS WHAT 
REMAINS OF THE MILITARY PLANE 
THAT TOOK OFF NEAR THE ALGERIAN 
CAPITAL.  
WILL
ACCORDING TO HIS TELEVISION IT 
WAS HEADING CLOSE TO THE BORDER 
WITH MOROCCO.  
SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF SOMETHING 
CAUSED IT TO PLUMMET IT MAY 
CRASH INTO A NEARBY FIELD.  
IT KILLED MORE THAN 200 PEOPLE. 
EMERGENCY SERVICES WERE QUICKLY 
AT THE SCENE WITH FIREFIGHTERS 
WORKING ALONGSIDE NUMBERS OF THE
CIVIL PROTECTION SERVICE.  
IN A STATEMENT THE ALGERIAN 
DEFENSE MINISTRY CONFIRMED THE 
CRASH HAD TAKEN PLACE BUT DID 
NOT GIVE ANY INFORMATION ON 
CASUALTIES.  
LOCAL MEDIA ARE REPORTING THAT 
AT LEAST 250 PEOPLE HAVE LOST 
THEIR LIVES.  
AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT YET 
CONFIRMED HOW MANY WERE ON 
BOARD.  
PROMPTING FEARS THAT THE 
CASUALTY RATE COULD CLIMB.  
ACCORDING TO LOCAL MEDIA MOST 
OF THOSE ON BOARD FOR MILITARY 
PERSONNEL.  
AMONG THEM SEVERAL MEMBERS OF 
THE FRONT, IN ALGERIAN BACKED 
GROUP SEEKING INDEPENDENCE FOR 
THE WESTERN SAHARA.  
THE ARMY CHIEF IS NOW 
OVERSEEING THE RESCUE EFFORT 
AND HAS ORDERED IN URGENT 
INVESTIGATION TO FIND OUT WHAT 
HAPPENED.  
WHAT CAUSED THIS MILITARY 
AIRPLANE TO EXPERIENCE SUCH 
PROBLEMS SO SOON AFTER TAKEOFF.
>>> WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE NEWS 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BREAK. 
STAY WITH US.
>>> CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN KELLY 
LOST HIS SON IN AFGHANISTAN 
EIGHT YEARS AGO.  
NOW HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW IS HELP
THEM TO KEEP HER HUSBAND'S 
MEMORY ALIVE AS WELL AS THE 
MEMORIES OF OTHER FALLEN 
SOLDIERS.  
HEATHER KELLY IS THE FOUNDER OF 
THE FOUNDATION, JAN CRAWFORD 
TAKES A LOOK AT THE MISSION.
>> REPORTER:  FROM THEIR FIRST 
DAYS AT THE NAVAL ACADEMY THEY 
STOOD TOGETHER.
>> THEY WERE BROTHERS FROM 
ANOTHER MOTHER.
>> REPORTER:  SO IT SEEMED 
FITTING, THAT IN THE END THEY 
WOULD REST TOGETHER.
>> THEY MOVED TRAVIS FROM HIS 
CEMETERY AND BURIED THEM SIDE-
BY-SIDE HERE AT ARLINGTON.
>> REPORTER:  PRESIDENT OBAMA 
EVEN PAID TRIBUTE TO THEIR 
FRIENDSHIP.
>> WARRIORS FOR FREEDOM. 
BROTHERS FOREVER.
>> REPORTER:  THEIR FAMILIES 
SHARED LOSS, BRENDAN SMITH WIFE 
AND TRAVIS'S SISTER FOUND A NEW 
BEGINNING.
>> YOU GET TO THIS POINT, WHAT 
COMES NEXT?
>> HE ALWAYS SAID BE STRONG, BE 
ACCOUNTABLE, NEVER COMPLAIN.  
YOU CAN BE FACED WITH 
CHALLENGES BUT IT IS REALLY 
ABOUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO.
>> REPORTER:  HEATHER KELLY 
LOST HER HUSBAND IN AFGHANISTAN.
HOW DID YOU COME THROUGH THAT?
>> SOMETIMES IT STILL FEELS 
LIKE IT HAS HAPPENED TO ANOTHER 
PERSON.
>> REPORTER:  DOES HE STILL 
FEEL VERY MUCH WITH YOU?
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.  
HE DID NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING 
ELSE.  
IT IS EXACTLY WHERE HE WAS MEANT
TO BE.
>> REPORTER:  THAT IS A 
SENTIMENT SHARED BY HIS FATHER, 
JOHN KELLY, NOW SERVING AS 
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF.
>> HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS GETTING 
INTO.  
BY THE BEST MEN ON THIS EARTH. -
>> REPORTER:  WAS IT A SURPRISE 
WHEN HE STARTED TO TALK ABOUT 
IT DURING THE BRIEFING?
>> YEAH, BUT I TRUST MY FATHER 
IN LAW 100%.
>> REPORTER:  WHAT WAS IT LIKE 
WHEN IT BECAME NEWS?
>> IN GENERAL, PEOPLE ARE 
SAYING HIS NAME, REMEMBERING 
WHAT HE DID, I AM HAPPY ABOUT 
THAT.
>> REPORTER:  THEY ALL KNOW 
THERE ARE MANY OTHER FAMILIES 
WHO FACE THE SAME LOSS.  
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM NOW?
>> I WOULD SAY TO THEM YOU ARE 
SUFFERING PROBABLY THE MOST 
HORRIBLE THING THAT WILL EVER 
HAPPEN TO YOU, BUT, THERE IS A 
LIGHT AHEAD.
>> REPORTER:  FOR THESE WOMEN 
THAT LIGHT WAS THE FOUNDATION, 
NAMED FOR RYAN'S BROTHER.
>> WE ASKED OURSELVES IF NOT ME 
THEN WHO.  
THOSE WERE THE WORDS MY BROTHER 
SPOKE BEFORE HE LEFT FOR HIS 
SECOND DEPLOYMENT.
>> REPORTER:  THE FOUNDATION 
USES THOSE WORDS TO BRING 
TOGETHER VETERANS AND THEIR 
FAMILIES.  
THOSE VOLUNTEERS GO ON TO SERVE 
IN DIFFERENT WAYS.  
CLEANING UP COMMUNITIES HERE AT 
HOME, BUILDING HOUSES, OR 
SIMPLY SHARING THE IMPORTANCE 
OF CHARACTER WITH MILLIONS OF 
SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN GROWING UP 
WITHOUT A POSITIVE ROLE MODEL.
>> IT IS NOT ONLY BENEFICIAL TO 
THE COMMUNITIES, BUT, IT IS 
ALSO BENEFICIAL TO THAT GOAL TO 
START A FAMILY MEMBER OR THAT 
VETERAN THAT IS GETTING OUT OF 
THE MILITARY AND WANTS TO FEEL 
A SENSE OF SERVICE AGAIN.
>> REPORTER:  THE FOUNDATION 
SIDES OF THEMSELVES THEY NEVER 
IMAGINE.
>> I THINK ALL OF US ARE JUST 
STRIVING TO LIVE LIVES A WORTHY 
OF TRAVIS AND BRENDAN AND 
ROBERT.  
ALL OF US, IN DIFFERENT WAYS, 
HAVE BEEN PUSHED OUTSIDE OF OUR 
COMFORT ZONE.
>> REPORTER:  WHAT WOULD 
BRENDAN SAY?
>> HE WOULD BE VERY PROUD OF 
THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS I HAVE HAD. 
HE WOULD BE FLOORED THAT I RAN 
26 MILES.  
I WAS AT A POINT WHERE IF 
SOMEONE WAS LIKE THIS SHOULD BE 
GREAT FOR YOU TO DO, I WOULD DO 
IT.
>> REPORTER:  WOULD HE BE 
SURPRISED?
>> YES.  
HE WOULD BE SHOCKED.  I AM 
PRETTY INTROVERTED.
>> REPORTER:  DO YOU EVER 
THINK, I WISH HE COULD SEE ME?
>> I HOPE THEY DO SEE US.
>> I FEEL LIKE THEY KNOW.
>> REPORTER:  COMING UP, A BIG 
QUESTION THAT STILL REMAINS AS 
MARK ZUCKERBERG WRAPS UP HIS 
TESTIMONY ON CAPITOL HILL.  
IS THERE MORE REGULATION AHEAD 
FOR THE TECH INDUSTRY?
>> REPORTER:  PRESIDENT TRUMP 
TWEETS A WARNING TO RUSSIA. 
-- AND PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETS A 
WARNING TO RUSSIA. 
PAUL RYAN IS STEPPING DOWN AS 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.  
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE 
REPUBLICAN AGENDA HEADING INTO 
THE MIDTERMS?  
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN.
>>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
I'M TANYA RIVERO.
THE UNITED STATES IS ON THE
BRINK OF TAKING MILITARY ACTION
AGAINST SYRIA AND IN SO DOING,
FINDS ITSELF CLOSER TO A
DANGEROUS CONFLICT WITH RUSSIA.
TODAY PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
PUBLICALLY VOWED TO TEST
RUSSIA'S MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM
IN SYRIA BY TWEETING, MISSILES,
QUOTE, WILL BE COMING, NICE,
NEW, AND SMART.
THE PRESIDENT CRITICIZED
RUSSIA'S BACKING OF SYRIAN
PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD WHO
THE PRESIDENT CALLED, QUOTE, A
GAS KILLING ANIMAL WHO KILLS HIS
PEOPLE AND ENJOYS IT.
THIS IS THE LATEST OF TENSIONS
BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE U.S. THE
PRESIDENT SAID OUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH RUSSIA IS WORSE NOW THAN IT
WAS DURING THE COLD WAR.
THE PRESIDENT DID ADD, QUOTE,
THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS, AND
ENCOURAGED ALL NATIONS TO WORK
TOGETHER.
THE TENSIONS WERE PROVOKED BY AN
ALLEGED DEADLY CHEMICAL ATTACK
IN
DUMA.
RUSSIA IS STANDING BY SYRIA AND
WARNING OF SERIOUS REPERCUSSIONS
IF THE U.S. OR OTHER NATIONS
STRIKE.
AS THIS UNFOLDS, THE THIRD
PERSON IN LINE TO THE PRESIDENCY
HAS ANNOUNCED HE WILL BE LEAVING
OFFICE IN JANUARY.
>> I THINK WE HAVE ACHIEVED A
HECK OF A LOT.
YOU ALL KNOW THAT I DID NOT SEEK
THIS JOB.
I TOOK IT RELUCTANTLY.
BUT I HAVE GIVEN THIS JOB
EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE.
AND I HAVE NO REGRETS WHATSOEVER
FOR HAVING ACCEPTED THIS
RESPONSIBILITY.
THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE TWO
GREATEST HONORS OF MY LIFE.
THE JOB PROVIDES INCREDIBLE
OPPORTUNITIES.
BUT THE TRUTH IS, IT'S EASY FOR
IT TO TAKE OVER EVERYTHING IN
YOUR LIFE.
BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS
FLEETING AS WELL, NAMELY YOUR
TIME AS A HUSBAND AND A DAD
WHICH IS THE OTHER GREAT HONOR
OF MY LIFE.
THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M ANNOUNCING
THAT THIS YEAR WILL BE MY LAST
ONE AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE.
TO BE CLEAR, I'M NOT RESIGNING.
I INTEND TO FILL MY FULL TERM AS
I WAS ELECTED TO DO.
BUT I WILL BE RETIRING IN
JANUARY, LEAVING THIS IN GOOD
HANDS WITH A BRIGHT FUTURE.
>> SPEAKER PAUL RYAN SAID
PASSING TAX REFORM LEGISLATION
WAS ONE OF HIS GREATEST
ACHIEVEMENTS AND ASSURED MEMBERS
OF HIS PARTY THAT DESPITE HIS
DEPARTURE, HE'D STILL HELP
FELLOW REPUBLICANS RUNNING IN
THE 2018 MIDTERMS.
ZEKE MILLER, WHITE HOUSE
REPORTER FOR THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS AND CBSN POLITICAL
CONTRIBUTOR JOINS US NOW FROM
WASHINGTON.
ZEKE, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE
TIMING OF RYAN'S ANNOUNCEMENT?
DOES THIS EFFECTIVELY MAKE HIM A
LAME DUCK FOR THE NEXT NINE
MONTHS?
>> CONGRESS ISN'T GOING TO BE
DOING A WHOLE LOT ANYWAY.
OBVIOUSLY THE TIMING IS DICTATED
BECAUSE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
CAN'T BE A SECRET IN WASHINGTON
FOR VERY LONG.
THERE'S THE QUESTION FOR THE
HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE
WHERE THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHO'S GOING TO REPLACE HIM AS
LEADER OR SPEAKER DEPENDING ON
WHETHER OR NOT REPUBLICANS HOLD
BACK TO THE HOUSE.
BUT IN TERMS OF LEGISLATING IN
WASHINGTON, THERE'S NOT A WHOLE
LOT OF JUICE THAT PAUL RYAN HAS.
LAWMAKERS ARE VERY -- AT THIS
POINT AT THAT STAGE IN THE
CONGRESS WHERE THEY ARE
SELFISHLY FOCUSED ON THEIR OWN
RE-ELECTION, AND THERE ISN'T A
WHOLE LOT LEFT ON THEIR PLATE TO
ACTUALLY DO OF ANY SUBSTANCE,
NOTHING THAT WILL REQUIRE STRICT
PARTY LINE
