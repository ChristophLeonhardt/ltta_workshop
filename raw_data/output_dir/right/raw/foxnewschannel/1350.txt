10
00:00:15,714 --> 00:00:17,449
FROM A COMIC WHICH MOST PEOPLE

11
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:21,853
FOUND NOT FUNNY AT ALL BUT

12
00:00:21,853 --> 00:00:27,159
RATHER OF    ABHORRENT.

13
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:28,961
>> ROSEANNE BARR WAS ON TOP OF

00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:29,962
THE WORLD.

15
00:00:29,962 --> 00:00:31,763
HER RESURRECTED SHOW WAS A HUGE

16
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:34,433
CHECK FOR ABC.

17
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:41,573

00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:55,221
ABHORRENT, REPUGNANT AND

25
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,156
INCONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES.

26
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:58,824
THE OFFENDING TWEET SAID IT,

27
00:00:58,824 --> 00:01:02,928
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND PLANET OF

28
00:01:02,928 --> 00:01:04,830

EQUALS BJ.

31
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:09,936
WHEN TWITTER USERS CALLED THE

32
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:13,372
LINE RACIST, SHE RESPONDED THAT

33
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:14,740
MUSLIMS ARE NOT A RACE.

34
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,375
SHE TWEETED LATER THAT SHE WAS

35
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,745
MAKING A JOKE BEFORE FINALLY

36
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,345
SAYING THIS.

HER LOOKS.

42
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:34,260
BUT THE OUTRAGE MOUNTED.

43
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,762
ACTRESS ACTRESS WANDA SYKES THAT

44
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,530
SHE WOULD NOT BE RETURNING.

45
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,400
ABC MUST TAKE ACTION NOW.

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,702
MANY OTHER COMEDIANS HAVE

47
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:43,403
SURVIVED OFFENSIVE JOKES.

48
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,539
STEPHEN COLBERT MADE A CRACK

WHO FAILED TO SHOW UP ON 9/11.

57
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:08,527

PARENT COMPANY DISNEY TO SAY,

59
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,931

HERE, AND THAT WAS THE RIGHT

61
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,133
THING.

62
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,401
ABC ACTED WITH STUNNING

63
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,203
SWIFTNESS TO PROTECT ITS BRAND

64
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:17,938
ALTHOUGH THE SHOW HAD BEEN VERY

65
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,339
LUCRATIVE.

66
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,941
IN THIS HYPER POLARIZED TWITTER

67
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:21,675
