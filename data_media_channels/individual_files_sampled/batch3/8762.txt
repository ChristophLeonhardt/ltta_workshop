Melissa: ON MEMORIAL DAY 2007 AND ARMY TROOPS DEPLOYED IN IRAQ WENT ON AN EMERGENCY RESCUE MISSION WHEN THEY WERE SUDDENLY AMBUSHED. SIX SOLDIERS DIED IN THE ATTACK. TIM LIVED THROUGH THAT MISSION AND ON THIS MEMORIAL DAY, THE HOMETOWN HERO WAS ASKED TO BE A GRAND MARSHAL IN HIS SMALL TOWN OF HIGHLANDS NEW JERSEY. TIM AGREED BUT UNDER THE CONDITION THAT THE REST OF HIS BROTHERS BE THERE TOO. WITH THE HELP OF GO FUND ME THE TOWN GOT THE TROOPS BACK TOGETHER AND IF ONLY YOU WERE THERE TO CAPTURE THEIR REUNION 11 YEARS LATER. IT'S UNDESCRIBABLE. LOSING FRIENDS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND NOT BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. WE LOST SIX THAT DAY. IT WAS A DARK MISSION. DOWN AIRCRAFT RECOVERY MISSION AND THEY GAVE US THE LOCATION TO GO, AND WE WENT AND WE GOT AMBUSHED ON THE WAY THERE AND LOST A FEW GUYS AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS MEMORIAL DAY UNTIL WE GOT BACK. MEMORIAL DAY, IT WAS A TOUGH DAY FOR ALL OF US. IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT JUST KIND OF PUNCHES YOU IN THE STOMACH AND TAKES THE BREATH AWAY. BUT LUCKILY I'VE GOT SOME GOOD TROOPERS OVER THERE TO HELP US ALL THROUGH IT. TIMMY STANDING BY US, GETTING US ALTOGETHER. IT JUST MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER. THE COMMANDER OF THE AMERICAN LEGION CALLED ME UP ONE DAY AND ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO DO IT AND I WASN'T SURE IF I DID DO IT AND I WASN'T SURE IF I DI DID. I DON'T EVER WANT TO DO STUFF ON THAT DAY, IT'S VERY PERSONAL AND WHEN HE SAID GRAND MARSHAL, I SAID LET ME GET BACK TO YOU AND I CALLED UP SOME OF THE GUYS THAT I WAS WITH ON THAT MEMORIAL DAY. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A BIGGER PARADE THAN ANYTHING THAT THEY'VE SEEN. WE ARE BROTHERS. THAT'S ALL IT IS. COMBAT VETS. WE ALWAYS STICK TOGETHER. WE ALWAYS HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACK. SO IT WAS AN HONOR. MEMORIAL DAY, IT'S A TOUGH DAY. A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO GO OUT THERE AND ENJOY THEMSELVES AND BARBECUE IT UP AND MAYBE HAVE A FEW AND THAT'S FINE, BUT I LIKE TO REMEMBER, NOT JUST FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE LOST, BUT THE PEOPLE BEFORE US. WE ARE PRETTY FORTUNATE TO BE IN A PLACE THAT WE ARE AT AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THEM THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO A LOT OF STUFF THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO TODAY. IT'S NOT VETERANS DAY, IT'S A DAY WHERE WE REMEMBER THOSE WHO DIED IN THE SERVICE OF OUR COUNTRY. I HAVEN'T LOOKED FORWARD TO A MEMORIAL DAY IN 11 YEARS BECAUSE THERE'S BILLBOARDS, THOSE RADIO COMMERCIALS. MEMORIAL DAY SALE, MEMORIAL DAY GIVEAWAY AND IT'S JUST A LOT MORE SOMBER FOR ME. IT'S A DAY OF HONOR, IT'S NOT A DAY OF SUMMER. I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE FORGET THAT. THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE I'VE GOT MY BROTHERS HERE. I HAVEN'T SEEN SOME OF THESE GUYS IN ABOUT TEN, SOME PEOPLE ABOUT 12 YEARS. SO BEING ABLE TO SEE THEM, IT REALLY MAKES ME HAPPY. IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE ME AGAIN. MY FRIEND JONATHAN, HIS WIFE AND HIS SON ARE COMING AND HE NEVER GOT TO KNOW HIS SON. HE WAS TOO YOUNG WHEN WE DEPLOYED. THIS IS A CHANCE FOR US TO LET HIS SON KNOW WHO HE WAS. AND HE'S GOING TO LEAD THE PARADE, INCLUDING THE TRIBUTE. IT'S DIFFERENT FOR US, IT'S VERY PERSONAL FOR US AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT THIS PARADE TO BE PERSONAL AND WE WANT TO REMIND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OF WHAT MEMORIAL DAY IS SUPPOSED TO BE. ♪ ♪
