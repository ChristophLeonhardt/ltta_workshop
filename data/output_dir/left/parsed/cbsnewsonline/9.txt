HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES.
AND IN EL PASO HE EVEN VOTED FOR
SOMETHING CALLED A RAIN TAX.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS,
BUT HERE IN TEXAS WE CELEBRATE
WHEN IT RAINS.
WE DON'T TAX YOU FOR IT.
ON REGULATIONS I'M PROUD TO HAVE
WORKED HAND IN HAND WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOO REPEAL JOB
KILLING REGULATIONS THAT WERE
HAMMERING THE STATE OF TEXAS.
BETO O'ROURKE SUPPORTS HIGHER
REGULATIONS HAMMER OIL AND GAS.
DC HAMMERING OIL AND GAS.
HAMMER -- HAMMERING OIL AND GAS.
HAMMERING THE STATE OF TEXAS.
IN FACT, BETO O'ROURKE VOTED IN
FAVOR OF A $10 A BARREL TAX ON
EVERY BARREL OF OIL PRODUCED IN
THE STATE OF TEXAS.
NOW THAT IS A TERRIFIC VOTE IF
YOU WANT TO RAISE MONEY IN SAN
FRANCISCO.
BUT THAT IS A TERRIBLE VOTE IF
YOU CARE ABOUT JOBS IN THE GREAT
STATE OF TEXAS.
BECAUSE THERE ARE MILLIONS OF
JOBS IN THE STATE OF TEXAS THAT
DEPEND ON A VIBRANT OIL AND GAS
INDUSTRY AND ENERGY INDUSTRY
BOOMING IN THE STATE OF TEXAS.
AND THE COMBINATION OF THE TAX
CULT AND -- CUT AND KILLING JOB
REGULATIONS, THE ECONOMY IN
TEXAS IS BOOMING.
WE ARE RIGHT NOW TODAY PRODUCING
33% MORE OIL THAN WE DID IN 2016
2016.
WE HAVE THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT
NATIONALLY IN 49 YEARS.
WE HAVE THE LOWEST
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT
THAT HAS EVER BEEN RECORDED.
WE HAVE THE LOWEST HISPANIC
UNEMPLOYMENT THAT HAS EVER BEEN
RECORDED.
WE HAVE THE LOWEST
ASIAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT THAT
HAS EVER BEEN RECORDED.
AND YOUNG PEOPLE, WE GOT A WHOLE
LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE HERE
TONIGHT.
WE HAVE THE LOWEST YOUTH
UNEMPLOYMENT IN 52 YEARS.
AND LET ME SAY LOOK ACROSS THE
TOYOTA CENTER WHERE WE'RE USED
TO SEEING OUR ROCKETS WIN.
AND BY THE WAY, THEY'RE GOING
ALL THE WAY THIS YEAR.
THIS IS HOUSTON.
THIS IS TEXAS.
THIS IS AN -- OF OUR CITY AND
STATE THAT WE WANT JOBS, WE WANT
FREEDOM, WE WANT OPPORTUNITY,
AND WE'RE DELIVERING ON ALL OF
THOSE.
WE'RE GETTING THERE.
WE'RE GETTING THERE.
ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT.
I'M FOR IT.
BETO'S AGAINST IT.
IN FACT, BETO TWEETED OUT TO THE
WORLD HOW PROUD HE IS TO HAVE AN
F RATING FROM THE NRA.
NOT A D NIGH NUS, NOT A D --
MINUS, NOT A D, AN F.
I PROMPTLY RETWEETED HIM.
ELECTIONS ARE ABOUT CHOICES.
IF YOU WANT A BIG GOVERNMENT GUN
GRABBING LIBERAL, WELL, THE
DEMOCRATS HAVE GIVEN YOU ONE.
ON ISRAEL TODAY THE UNITED
STATES EMBASSY IS IN JERUSALEM,
THE ONCE AND ETERNAL CAPITAL OF
ISRAEL.
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE THE
COURAGEOUS THE RIGHT DECISION TO
MOVE THE EMBASSY.
I WAS PROUD TO BE IN JERUSALEM
FOR THE OPENING OF THE EMBASSY
ON THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
CREATION OF THE MODERN STATE OF
ISRAEL.
BETO O'ROURKE HAS THE MOST
ANTI-ISRAEL RECORD OF ANY
DEMOCRATIC SENATE NOMINEE IN THE
COUNTRY.
LET ME GIVE YOU SPECIFICS.
IN 2014 WHEN HAMAS WAS RAINING
ROCKETS DOWN ON ISRAEL, BETO WAS
ONE OF EIGHT, EIGHT, MEMBERS OF
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE TO
VOTE AGAINST FUNDING ISRAEL'S
IRON DOME MISSILE DEFENSE
SYSTEM.
VIRTUALLY EVERY REPUBLICAN VOTED
YES.
VIRTUALLY EVERY DEMOCRAT VOTED
YES.
NANCY PELOSI VOTED YES.
MAXINE WATERS VOTED YES.
BUT BETO O'ROURKE VOTED NO AND
WOULDN'T STAND WITH THE PEOPLE
OF ISRAEL.
ON JUDGES I'M PROUD TO HAVE LED
THE EFFORT TO CONFIRM JUSTICE
NEIL GORSUCH AND JUSTICE BRETT
KAVANAUGH.
>> USA.
USA.
USA.
>> AND FOR EVERY ONE OF US WHO
CARES ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION,
WHO CARES ABOUT THE BILL OF
RIGHTS, WHO CARES ABOUT FREE
SPEECH AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND
THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND THE
TENTH AMENDMENT RIGHT FOR THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO LEAVE US
THE ALONE, THOSE JUDGES
MATTER.
AND FOR THE RECORD, I AM NOT
SPARTACUS.
YOU CAN BE SURE IF BETO O'ROURKE
HAD BEEN IN THE SENATE HE'D HAVE
PUT ON THE TOGA AND STARTED THE
CIRCUS.
THAT'S NOT TEXAS.
ON IMMIGRATION THERE IS NO RACE
IN THE COUNTRY WITH A STARKER
DIVIDE ON IMMIGRATION THAN THIS
U.S. SENATE RACE HERE IN THE
STATE OF TEXAS.
ON MY PART, I AM HONORED TO HAVE
THE FORMAL ENDORSEMENT OF THE
NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL,
THE UNION OF THE MEN AND WOMEN
WHO RISK THEIR LIVES KEEPING THE
BORDER SAFE AND PROTECTING OUR
COUNTRY.
WE NEED TO BUILD THE WALL.
SO THIS IS TEXAS, BUT BETO NOT
ONLY OPPOSES A WALL, BUT HE SAYS
WE HAVE TOO MANY BORDER WALLS
AND FENCES ALREADY.
WE NEED TO TEAR DOWN THE BORDER
WALLS WE ALREADY HAVE.
HE SUPPORTS SANCTUARY SANCTUARY
CITIES AND
HE HAS SAID HE IS QUOTE OPEN TO,
THESE ARE HIS WORDS, OPEN TO
ABOLISHING I.C.E.
THAT IS RADICAL.
THAT IS RECKLESS.
AND THAT IS NOT THE STATE OF
TEXAS.
NOT ONLY THIS, BETO O'ROURKE IS
THE ONLY DEMOCRATIC SENATE
NOMINEE IN THE COUNTRY TO COME
OUT EXPLICITLY FOR IMPEACHING
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.
HE SAID HE WOULD VOTE RIGHT NOW
TODAY TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT
TRUMP.
BETO O'ROURKE IN THIS STATE IS
RUNNING TO THE LEFT OF ELIZABETH
WARREN, TO THE LEFT OF BERNIE
SANDERS, AND THE STATE OF TEXAS
IS NOT GOING TO STAND FOR IT.
IN TEXAS WE SUPPORT LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
IN TEXAS WE SUPPORT OUR
VETERANS.
IN TEXAS WE STAND FOR THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM AND WE HAVE A
HAND OVER OUR HEART WHERE WE
SALUTE IF WE'RE IN UNIFORM.
THAT IS WHO WE ARE.
AND I'M GOING TO MAKE A
PREDICTION TO EACH AND EVERY
PERSON HERE, IN 2020 DONALD
TRUMP WILL BE OVERWHELMINGLY
REELECTED AS PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
I AM HONORED THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP IS HERE ENDORSING AND
SUPPORTING MY CAMPAIGN.
ÃºAND I LO
CAMPAIGNING ALONGSIDE HIM IN
2020 FOR HIS RE-ELECTION AS
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
IT IS A GREAT PRIVILEGE NOW TO
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE TO
YOU THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES, THE MAN WHO HAS
PRESIDED OVER RECORD JOBS,
RECORD UNEMPLOYMENT, THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.
 >> WOW.
>> USA USA USA.
>> HELLO HOUSTON.
I'M THRILLED TO BE BACK.
YOU TREATED ME VERY WELL DURING
A CERTAIN ELECTION TWO YEARS
AGO.
WITH ALL MY FRIEND FROM THE LOAN
STAR STATE, A SPECIAL SPECIAL --
LONE STAR STATE, A SPECIAL
SPECIAL PLACE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.
THIS IS SOME RECORD CROWD.
AND THEY JUST TOLD ME WE BROKE
THE RECORD.
BUT WE COULD REALLY BREAK IT IF
WE COULD GET ALL THE PEOPLE WHO
ARE OUTSIDE IN HERE.
WE'D BREAK IT BY THREE TIMES.
BUT IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY.
EVERYTHING IN TEXAS IS JUST
BIGGER.
RIGHT?
IT'S BIGGER.
IN JUST 15 DAYS THE PEOPLE OF
TEXAS ARE GOING TO REELECT A MAN
WHO HAS BECOME A REALLY GOOD
FRIEND OF MINE.
YOU KNOW WE HAD OUR LITTLE
DIFFICULTIES.
BUT ACTUALLY IF YOU REMEMBER,
THE BEGINNING IT WAS A LOVE
FEST.
AND THEY KEPT SAYING, THE FAKE
NEWS BACK HERE, THEY KEPT SAYING
-- REMEMBER THEY KEPT
SAYING WELL WHEN IS IT GOING TO
BREAK UP?
I SAID DON'T WORRY, IT'LL BREAK
UP.
WE ACTUALLY HAD A RALLY IN
WASHINGTON, D.C. TOGETHER.
AND NOBODY COULD BELIEVE IT.
THEY SAID WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
BUT WE HAD THE RALLY TOGETHER.
AND THEN WE SAID, YOU KNOW, IT'S
TIME.
THAT'S WHAT'S GOT TO HAPPEN.
AND IT GOT NASTY.
AND THEN IT ENDED.
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
NOBODY HAS HELPED ME MORE WITH
YOUR TAX CUTS, WITH YOUR
REGULATION, WITH ALL OF THE
THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING
INCLUDING MILITARY AND OUR VETS
THAN SENATOR TED CRUZ, NOBODY.
HE DEFENDED YOUR JOBS.
HE DEFENDED YOUR BORDERS.
AND WE ARE DEFENDING THAT BORDER
BY THE WAY, IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T
NOTICED.
WE ARE DEFENDING THAT BORDER.
HE DEFENDS YOUR FAMILIES.
HE DEFENDS YOUR FAITH.
AND WE ARE DEFENDING TOGETHER
WITH A LOT OF OTHER GREAT
REPUBLICANS YOUR FREEDOM.
NOW, EARLY VOTING IS NOW
UNDERWAY.
SO GET OUT THERE AND VOTE.
IT IS UNDERSTOOD WAY AS WE
SPEAK.
IF YOU'D LIKE TO LEAVE NOW, GO
AHEAD.
ANYBODY WANT TO LEAVE NOW GO
VOTE, COME BACK.
GET BEHIND ABOUT 50,000 PEOPLE
OUTSIDE WHO WE LOVE.
AND WE PUT BIG SCREENS OUT FOR
THEM.
LET'S WAVE TO THEM.
WAVE.
BUT I WILL SAY YOU GOT A BETTER
LOCATION.
YOUR LOCATION'S BETTER.
AND TED IS LEADING THE CHARGE IN
CONGRESS FOR MORE TAX CUTS.
IN FACT, I JUST LEFT KEVIN
BRADY.
BY THE WAY, HOW GOOD IS KEVIN
BRADY?
HE'S HERE.
WE'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING IN A
10% TAX CUT FOR MIDDLE INCOME
FAMILIES.
IT'S GOING TO BE PUT IN NEXT
YEAR.
10% TAX CUT.
KEVIN BRADY HAS BEEN WORKING ON
IT.
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR
SEVERAL MONTHS.
THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE BIG
TAX CUTS YOU'VE ALREADY GOTTEN.
BUT THIS ONE IS FOR MIDDLE
INCOME.
THIS IS NO BUSINESS.
BUSINESS IS NOW GOOD.
THEY'RE COMING BACK.
THE JOBS ARE COMING BACK.
THE PLANTS AND FACTORIES ARE
COMING BACK LIKE NEVER BEFORE.
THEY'RE ALL COMING BACK.
THIS IS FOR MIDDLE INCOME
PEOPLE.
ALL MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE A BIG
TAX CUT.
10%.
WE'LL BE PUTTING IT IN NEXT
YEAR.
NOW, THE DEMOCRATS TAKE OVER, I
CAN'T SPEAK.
I'M SORRY.
INSTEAD OF A TAX CUT, YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE A BIG, BEAUTIFUL
TAX RAISE.
YOU DON'T WANT THAT.
YOU KNOW, EXPLAIN THAT TO ME.
THEY'RE FOR OPEN BORDERS WHICH
MEANS CRIME.
AND FOR MASSIVE TAX CUTS.
THEY'RE AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT.
THEY'RE TOTALLY AGAINST I.C.E.
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.
THEY'RE AGAINST YOUR MILITARY.
AND THEY'RE NOT GOOD TO YOUR
VETS.
HOW DO YOU WIN ON THAT PLATFORM?
HOW DO YOU WIN?
SO WE'RE DOING AGAIN WE'VE DONE
THE BIGGEST REGULATION CUTS IN
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY AND
I'M ONLY HERE FOR ALMOST TWO
YEARS, ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT LESS
THAN TWO YEARS, WE HAVE ANOTHER
THREE MONTHS.
AND WE'VE ALREADY DONE MORE TAX
CUTS AND WE'VE ALREADY DONE THE
BIGGEST TAX CUT, BUT WE'VE DONE
MORE REGULATION CUTS THAN ANY
OTHER PRESIDENT IN HISTORY.
AND THAT'S FOUR YEARS, EIGHT
YEARS, 12 YEARS.
AND WHAT WE'RE DOING, WE WANT
PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY.
WE HAVE A 3.7% UNEMPLOYMENT.
IT'S THE LOWEST IT'S BEEN IN
MORE THAN 50 YEARS.
BUT THEY HAVE TO COME IN
LEGALLY.
AND THATVY TO COME IN THROUGH --
AND THEY HAVE TO COME IN THROUGH
MERIT.
THROUGH MERIT.
THAT'S HAPPENING.
NEED IT.
SO WE STARTED THE WALL.
WE GOT $1.6 BILLION.
WE GOT ANOTHER $1.6 BILLION.
AND WE GOT A THIRD.
I WANT TO DO IT QUICK.
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS A LARGE
GROUP OF PEOPLE, THEY CALL IT A
CARAVAN, YOU KNOW HOW THE
CARAVAN STARTED?
DOES EVERYBODY KNOW WHAT THIS
MEANS, HUH?
I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AND NOW
THEY'RE SAYING I THINK WE MADE A
BIG MISTAKE.
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SEEING HOW
BAD IT IS, HOW PATHETIC IT IS,
HOW BAD OUR LAWS ARE, THEY MADE
A BIG MISTAKE.
SO AS THE CARAVAN -- AND LOOK,
THAT IS AN ASSAULT ON OUR
COUNTRY.
THAT'S AN ASSAULT.
AND IN THAT CARAVAN, YOU HAVE
SOME VERY BAD PEOPLE.
YOU HAVE SOME VERY BAD PEOPLE.
AND WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO
OUR COUNTRY.
AND IT'S NOT.
AND I WAS JUST TALKING TO YOUR
GREAT GOVERNOR AND SENATORS AND
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT YOUR
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO I'M GOING
TO BE INTRODUCING IN A SECOND.
BUT I'M TALKING TO A LOT OF YOUR
PEOPLE AND THEY'RE GOING TO FORM
A WALL, DIFFERENT KIND OF A WALL
UNTIL WE GET THE OTHER ONE
BUILT.
WE NEED A WALL BUILT FAST, FAST.
WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS.
WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS.
WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY.
WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS.
AND TED, YOU PROBABLY SAW, DID A
BEAUTIFUL JOB IN STARING DOWN AN
ANGRY LEFT WING MOB IN OUR
RECENT SUPREME COURT BATTLE
VICTORY, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO
CALL IT.
HE WAS GREAT.
AND THANKS TO TED AND OUR OTHER
GREAT REPUBLICANS, BECAUSE WE
HAD NO HELP FROM THE OTHER SIDE
AS YOU KNOW.
WE NOW HAVE A BRAND NEW MEMBER
OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME
COURT, JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH.
AND ALSO THIS IS SUCH AN HONOR,
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, YOU'VE HAD
MANY PRESIDENTS.
THEY NEVER GET TO PUT A JUSTICE
ON THE SUPREME COURT.
THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR A LONG
TIME.
THINK OF THIS.
IT'S THE STORY OF OUR LIVES.
I'VE BEEN THERE LESS THAN TWO
YEARS AND I HAVE TWO OF THEM
BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE A FANTASTIC
NEW JUSTICE IN NEIL GORSUCH.
WE HAD HIM JUST APPROVED.
HE WAS JUST CONFIRMED.
AND WE HAVE A RECORD NUMBER OF
CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES FOR THE
TIME THAT WE'VE BEEN IN OFFICE.
AND THAT WE FULLY EXPECT TO GO
TO THE AL TIME RECORD -- ALL
TIME RECORD.
AND PERCENTAGE WISE IT'S RIGHT
UP THERE AND WE'VE ONLY BEEN
HERE A SHORT -- OKAY, READY,
HERE'S A QUESTION.
PERCENTAGE WISE WHO HAS MORE
JUSTICES, FEDERAL JUDGES
APPOINTED, PERCENTAGE WISE THAN
ANY OTHER PRESIDENT?
WHO IS IT?
NO, MORE.
WHO APPOINTED THE HIGHEST
PERCENTAGE OF JUDGES?
NO.
NO.
NO.
WASN'T HILLARY CLINTON.
NO, SHE DIDN'T MAKE IT,
REMEMBER?
NO, YOU KNOW WHO IT IS?
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS.
IT'S CALLED GEORGE WASHINGTON.
AND WE'RE AFTER GEORGE
WASHINGTON SO A VERY BIG THING.
NO, GEORGE WASHINGTON, WHY?
BECAUSE HE JUST STARTED.
HE DID 100%.
NOBODY'S EVER GOING TO BREAK
THAT RECORD.
NOBODY'S EVER GOING TO BREAK THE
RECORD OF GEORGE WASHINGTON.
GOOD OLD GEORGE.
HE NEVER TOLD A LIE.
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.
GEORGE WASHINGTON, RIGHT?
HE NEVER TOLD A LIE.
BUT HE DID 100% OF THE JUDGES.
WE'LL NEVER BEAT THAT RECORD.
BUT WE'RE GETTING CLOSE.
WHAT THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS DID
TO JUSTICE KAVANAUGH AND HIS
BEAUTIFUL FAMILY IS A NATIONAL
DISGRACE.
THEY WERE ON A RUTHLESS MISSION
TO OBSTRUCT, RESIST, DELAY,
DEMOLISH, AND DESTROY WHICH IS
ALL THEY KNOW HOW TO DO.
THE FACT IS THEY'RE LOUSY
POLITICIANS.
THEY HAVE HORRIBLE POLICY BUT
THEY STICK TOGETHER.
THAT'S ONE GOOD THING.
THEY ALWAYS STICK TOGETHER.
OTHER THAN THAT THEY'RE NOT
DOING TOO WELL.
IF YOU WANT THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA
TO FINALLY INVESTIGATE -- BY THE
WAY, DON'T WORRY, I DON'T LIKE
THEM EITHER.
BUT LOOK AT THIS.
JUST LOOK.
HERE WE ARE.
WE'RE DOING A RALLY FOR TED.
AND IT'S GREAT.
WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE.
LOOK HOW MANY MADE IT.
THIS IS LIKE, IT'S LIKE THIS IS
THE ACADEMY AWARDS WHICH
ACTUALLY HAS GONE DOWN THE
TUBES.
I THINK WE DO MUCH BETTER.
LOOK HOW MANY.
LOOK HOW MANY.
LOOK AT THEM.
YOU RECOGNIZE MANY OF THOSE
HAPPY FACES BACK THERE?
I KNOW EVERY ONE OF THEM.
I KNOW EVERY ONE OF THEM.
AND 15% OF THEM ARE GREAT.
EVERY ONE.
I KNOW EVERY ONE.
BUT IF YOU WANT THE FAKE NEWS TO
FINALLY INVESTIGATE HILLARY
CLINTON, WE'LL JUST HAVE --
YEAH.
I DIDN'T DO IT.
I DIDN'T DO IT.
I DIDN'T DO IT.
SO IF YOU WANT THEM TO
INVESTIGATE, WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
NOMINATE HILLARY CLINTON TO THE
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?
RIGHT?
LET'S SEE HOW SHE DOES.
IF JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAD TO GO
THROUGH WHAT HE WENT THROUGH,
AND HE'S A FINE MAN.
CAN YOU IMAGINE HILLARY UP
THERE?
THAT WOULD TAKE THREE TO FOUR
YEARS OF QUESTIONS.
AND STAKE IN THIS ELECTION IS
WHETHER WE CONTINUE THE
EXTRAORDINARY PROSPERITY THAT
WE'VE ALL ACHIEVED OR WHETHER WE
LET THE RADICAL DEMOCRAT MOB
TAKE A GIANT WRECKING BALL AND
DESTROY OUR COUNTRY AND OUR
ECONOMY.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE JUST FELL
TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN
50 YEARS.
5-0.
HERE'S ONE THAT'S HARD TO BEAT
BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS
WORKING AT THIS MOMENT, THINK OF
IT, AT THIS MOMENT, WORKING
WORKING WORKING, THE NUMBER OF
AMERICANS WORKING HAS JUST
REACHED THE HIGHEST IN THE
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.
ALL TIME HIGH.
WE HAVE ELIMINATED A RECORD
NUMBER OF JOB-KILLING
REGULATIONS.
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS OUR
COMPANIES ARE ALL COMING BACK.
REPUBLICANS PASSED THE BIGGEST
TAX CUT AND REFORM IN HISTORY
WITH MASSIVE TAX CUTS FOR THE
MIDDLE CLASS AND NOW WE'RE
ADDING 10% TO THOSE NUMBERS.
WE'VE SAVED YOUR FAMILY FARMS,
RANCHES, AND SMALL BUSINESSES
FROM THE ESTATE TAX ALSO KNOWN
AS THE DEATH TAX.
SO MOST OF YOU LOVE YOUR
CHILDREN.
SOME OF YOU DON'T.
BUT THE ONES THAT DON'T, DON'T
LISTEN TO ME BECAUSE THIS WON'T
MATTER.
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
LEAVE IT ANYWAY.
AND IF YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR
CHILDREN, AND IF YOUR CHILDREN
DIDN'T TREAT YOU GOOD, DON'T
LEAVE THEM ANYTHING.
GIVE IT TO CHARITY OR SOMEBODY
ELSE.
BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHAT REALLY
WOULD LIKE YOUR SMALL
BUSINESSES, YOUR O FARMS, YOUR
-- YOUR FARMS, YOUR RANCHES LEFT
TO YOUR CHILDREN INSTEAD OF NOW
HAVING YOUR CHILDRE GO OUT WHEN
YOU KICK THE BUCKET.
IT'S THEIR DAY THEN ABOUT TWO OR
THREE DAYS LATER THEY'RE HAPPY
AS -- NO FORGET IT.
INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM GO OUT
AND BORROW A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
OF MONEY TO PAY THE ESTATE TAX,
THEY DON'T HAVE TO BORROW
ANYTHING.
THERE'S NO TAX.
THERE'S NO TAX.
SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO -- TO ME
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
NOBODY EVEN TALKS ABOUT.
THAT WAS IN OUR TAX CUT.
A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESS, FARMS,
RANCHES, AND THERE'LL BE NO TAX.
SO THAT'S GREAT FOR YOUR
CHILDREN.
ONLY IF YOU LOVE THEM.
ANYBODY IN HERE DOES NOT LOVE
THEIR CHILD?
ANYBODY?
TWO PEOPLE.
THAT'S NOT BAD.
MY ADMINISTRATION ALSO ENDED THE
HORRIBLE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY.
SOMETHING YOU PEOPLE KNOW A LOT
ABOUT.
WE WENT THROUGH THE UNITED
STATES FROM THE VERY UNFAIR,
ONE-SIDED PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD
WHICH WAS PUTTING US OUT OF
BUSINESS.
ON DAY ONE I APPROVED THE
KEYSTONE AND THE DAKOTA ACCESS
PIPELINE.
48,000 JOBS.
DAY ONE.
DAY ONE.
THINK OF THAT.
DAY ONE.
THEY SPENT YEARS AND YEARS
TRYING TO GET THESE PIPELINES
BUILT.
AND BY THE WAY, WE'RE SPEEDING
UP THE APPROVAL PROCESS BY A
FACTOR OF TEN FOR YOUR PIPELINES
THAT YOU DESPERATELY NEED IN
TEXAS TO GET THE OIL TO ITS
DESTINATION.
WE'RE SPEEDING IT UP.
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH.
WITH TEXAS LEADING THE WAY,
THINK OF THIS ONE, THE UNITED
STATES IS NOW -- THIS HAPPENED
OVER THE LAST VERY SHORT PERIOD
OF TIME -- THE LARGEST PRODUCER
OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S BIG STUFF.
TWOOER NUMBER ONE ENERGY --
WE'RE THE NUMBER ONE ENERGY
PRODUCER IN THE WORLD.
WHO WOULD THINK THAT?
AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THE
PIPELINES APPROVED RAPIDLY.
I CALL THE HEADS OF THE
AGENCIES.
I SAY GET THEM APPROVED.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WE LET THEM
KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM
IMMEDIATELY.
WE DON'T TAKE THEM 20 YEARS DOWN
THE ROAD AND THEN SAY WE CAN'T
APPROVE IT.
WE LET THEM KNOW IMMEDIATELY
THERE WON'T BE A PROBLEM.
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN
60 YEARS AMERICA IS A NET
EXPORTER OF NATURAL GAS.
AND HERE'S GOOD NEWS FOR TEXAS.
GOOD NEWS FOR TEXAS.
BECAUSE JUST TODAY GERMANY'S
CHANCELLOR, ANGELA MERKEL, HAS
ANNOUNCED THAT HER COUNTRY WILL
NOW PURCHASE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF
LNG, WHICH IS GREAT NEWS FOR
YOUR STATE.
AND I TOLD ALL OF THE EUROPEAN
NATIONS, IT'S NOT FAIR.
WE HAVE ALL THESE HORRIBLE TRADE
IMBALANCES M THEY TAKE SUCH --
IMBALANCES.
THEY TAKE SUCH ADVANTAGE.
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP
AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN.
AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN
BECAUSE WE ARE PUTTING AMERICA
FIRST.
WE'RE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST.
IT HASN'T HAPPENED IN A LOT OF
DECADES.
WE'RE PUTTING THEM FIRST.
WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OURSELVES
FOR A CHANGE, FOLKS.
THANK YOU.
I LIKE THAT GUY BUT NOT THAT
MUCH.
NOT THAT MUCH.
BUT RADICAL DEMOCRATS WANT TO
TURN BACK THE CLOCK -- RULE OF
CORRUPT, POWER HUNGRY
GLOBALISTS.
YOU KNOW WHAT A GLOBALIST IS,
RIGHT?
YOU KNOW WHAT A GLOBALIST IS.
A GLOBALIST IS A PERSON THAT
WANTS THE GLOBE TO DO WELL,
FRANKLY, NOT CARING ABOUT OUR
COUNTRY SO MUCH.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.
YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE A WORD, IT
SORT OF BECAME OLD FASHIONED.
IT'S CALLED A NATIONALIST.
AND I SAY REALLY, WE'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO USE THAT WORD.
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM?
I'M A NATIONALIST, OKAY?
I'M A NATIONALIST.
NATIONALIST.
NOTHING MORE.
USE THAT WORD.
USE THAT WORD.
THEY REPORTED YESTERDAY THAT
DONALD TRUMP IS VERY UNPOPULAR
WITH OTHER NATIONS.
HE'S ONE OF THE MOST UNPOPULAR
PRESIDENTS IN THE HISTORY OF
POLLING.
AND I SAID NO.
I SAID OF COURSE I'M UNPOPULAR
WITH FOREIGN NATIONS.
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LETTING THEM
RIP US OFF ANYMORE, FOLKS.
OKAY?
THEY MEANT IT TO BE BAD.
OR THE FAKE NEWS THEY MEANT IT
TO BE BAD.
DONALD TRUMP VERY UNPOPULAR WITH
OTHER NATIONS.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I HAD?
IT WAS 70% AGAINST AND 30% FOR.
I SAID WHO IS THE 30%?
WHY WOULD THEY EVER WANT TO VOTE
FOR ME?
BECAUSE HONESTLY, WE'RE TREATING
EVERYBODY GOOD.
WE'RE HELPING PEOPLE.
WE'RE PROTECTING PEOPLE.
WHEN WE PROTECT WITH OUR
MILITARY, THE GREATEST IN THE
WOORLD, AND NOW IT'S -- WORLD,
AND NOW IT'S GREATER THAN IT'S
EVER BEEN, WE HAVE TO BE
REIMBURSED FOR THAT PROTECTION.
WE'RE PROTECTING THE WEALTHIEST
NATIONS IN THE WORLD.
AND WE'RE SUBSIDIZING THEM.
AND THEN THEY BEAT US ON TRADE.
THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US.
SO THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.
YOU'RE SEEING IT HAPPENING FAST.
THE MOST UNPOPULAR PRESIDENT.
THINK OF THAT.
MOST UNPOPULAR PRESIDENT.
BUT I'M ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR
PRESIDENTS IN THIS COUNTRY AND
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S JUST GOOD.
IN OUR COUNTRY.
COUPLE OF POLLS CAME OUT TODAY
THAT WERE VERY GOOD.
AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THEM
ON.
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO ANNOUNCE
THEM.
AND THEY PAID FOR THE POLLS.
WE HAVE A NEW POLL OUT, LET ME
SEE, OH, LET'S GET TO ANOTHER
SUBJECT.
FAKE NEWS.
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO REPLACE
FREEDOM WITH SOCIALISM.
THEY WANT TO REPLACE TEXAS
VALUES WITH NANCY PELOSI VALUES.
AND THEY WANT TO REPLACE THE
RULE OF LAW WITH THE RULE OF THE
MOB.
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.
AND THE DEMOCRATS WOULD RATHER
DESTROY AMERICAN COMMUNITIES
THAN DEFEND AMERICA'S BORDERS.
I'M NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN.
GOT TO VOTE FOR TED CRUZ.
DEMOCRATS -- THE DEMOCRATS
ARE A BIG RISK TO THE AMERICAN
FAMILY AND OUR COUNTRY CANNOT
AFFORD TO TAKE THOSE KIND OF
RISKSMENT WE CAN'T.
THIS WILL BE -- RISKS.
WE CAN'T.
THIS WILL BE THE ELECTION OF THE
CARAVAN, KAVANAUGH, LAW AND
ORDER, TAX CUTS, AND COMMON
SENSE.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS, COMMON SENSE.
TED EASE OPPONENT IN THIS RACE
-- TED'S OPPONENT IN THIS RACE
IS A STONE COLD PHONY NAMED
ROBERT FRANCIS O'ROURKE.
SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS BETO.
AND HE PRETENDS TO BE A MODERATE
BUT HE'S ACTUALLY A RADICAL OPEN
BORDERS LEFT WINGER.
THAT'S WHAT HE IS.
AND I KNOW TEXAS WELL.
DON'T FORGET.
THEY TRIED TO CONVINCE YOU ON
ELECTION NIGHT THAT TEXAS IS IN
PLAY.
I KEPT HEARING.
I GO TO A THING AND I --
REMEMBER THE LINES I'D HAVE FOR
THE SPEECHES?
I HATE TO TELL YOU, I THINK THE
LINES ARE BIGGER TONIGHT THAN
THEY WERE TWO YEARS AGO.
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE I PRODUCED.
I PRODUCED.
BECAUSE I PRODUCED.
NO, THE LINES ARE BIGGER
TONIGHT.
AND IT'S EASIER.
YOU KNOW, TWO YEARS AGO, TWO AND
A HALF YEARS AGO I HAVE TO GET
UP AND SAY WE WILL GIVE YOU TAX
CUTS.
WE WILL GIVE YOU REGULAR -- WE
WILL CUT REGULATIONS.
BUT IT WAS JUST WORDS.
NOW I CAN DO IT.
THIS IS EASY.
IN FACT, SOME OF THOSE GUYS IF
THEY DON'T QUESTION IT WILL SAY
THAT I PRODUCED MORE THAN I
PROMISED WHICH IS TRUE, WHICH IS
TRUE.
ACCURATE.
BUT O'ROURKE VOTED AGAINST YOUR
TAX CUTS.
AND HE WENT AGAINST TEXAS OIL
WORKERS WITH THE JOB-KILLING
REGULATIONS AND TAXES THAT WERE
REALLY REALLY HURTING THOSE JOBS
AND THOSE COMPANIES.
O'ROURKE SUPPORTS A SOCIALIST
TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE.
YOU'RE GOING TO TRIPLE YOUR
TAXES AND IT WON'T BE ENOUGH.
AND IT'LL BE LOUSY HEALTH CARE.
YOU'LL END UP WAITING FOR FIVE
WEEKS TO SEE A DOCTOR.
AND I HEARD TED SAY JUST BEFORE
I WENT ON, BUT TO ME THIS IS A
BEAUTY, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW OF
ANYBODY THAT'S EARNED THIS
RATING.
HE GOT AN F FROM THE NRA.
ONE OF THE FEW.
YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHAT AN F
MEANS.
AN F MEANS HE WANTS TO TAKE AWAY
YOUR GUNS.
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS.
I NEVER EVEN HEARD OF AN F.
LOUIE, DID YOU HEAR OF AN F?
I NEVER HEARD IT.
DO WE LOVE LOUIE?
DO WE LOVE LOUIE?
LOOK AT HIM.
LOUIE GOMER, WE LOVE HIM.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT LOUIE'S RATING
IS BUT I'D ASSUME IT'S ABOUT A
WHAT, A PLUS?
A PLUS PLUS.
LOUIE.
I LOVE PEOPLE THAT ARE GUTS.
HE HAS GUTS.
HE HAS GUTS.
GETS UP THERE.
THEY DEFEND YOU.
AND THEY DEFEND YOUR SECOND
AMENDMENT.
AND IF TED DOESN'T WIN, YOUR
SECOND AMENDMENT'S GOING TO BE
IN TROUBLE.
BIG TROUBLE.
REMEMBER THAT.
O'ROURKE VOTED AGAINST THE
BORDER WALL.
THAT'S A GOOD THING TO VOTE.
HE VOTED FOR OBAMA AMNESTY.
OBAMA AMNESTY.
O'ROURKE EVEN VOTED TO SHIELD
MS-13 GANG MEMBERS FROM
DEPORTATION.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO DEPORT THEM.
HE SAYS THEY'RE PEOPLE.
THEY'RE PEOPLE.
THEY CARVE YOU UP WITH A KNIFE
BUT THEY'RE PEOPLE.
O'ROURKE VOTED IN FAVOR OF
SANCTUARY
SANCTUARY CITIES THAT RESULT IN
THE DEATHS OF COUNTLESS
AMERICANS.
TODAY'S DEMOCRAT PARTY WOULD
RATHER PROTECT CRIMINAL ALIENS
THAN AMERICAN CITIZENS WHICH IS
WHY THE DEMOCRATS MUST BE VOTED
OUT OF OFFICE.
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICAN VOTES.
A VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT THIS
NOVEMBER IS A VOTE TO SURRENDER
CONGRESS TO NANCY PELOSI, CRYING
CHUCK SCHUMER, THE GREAT MAXINE
WATERS.
THAT'S A BEAUTY.
MAXINE WATERS.
YOU GET THAT ONE?
YOU GET THAT?
MAXINE.
SHE'S GOING BE IN CHARGE OF YOUR
FINANCES.
MAXINE.
GOOD OLD MAXINE.
LOW IX INDIVIDUAL -- IQ
INDIVIDUAL.
SHE'S LOW IQ.
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN.
THE MAYOR WHO DID ONE OF THE
WORST JOBS OF ANY MAYOR OTHER
THAN THE GUY RUNNING FOR
GOVERNOR IN FLORIDA.
HE WAS A HORRIBLE MAYOR TOO.
CORY BOOKER.
HE DESTROYED WHAT HE DID.
HE WAS SO BAD RUNNING NEWARK.
AND A SAD THING HAPPENED LAST
WEEK.
BECAUSE ELIZABETH WARREN WAS
EXPOSED AS BEING A TOTAL FRAUD.
AND I CAN NO LONGER CALL HER
POCAHONTAS BECAUSE SHE HAS NO
INDIAN BLOOD.
I CAN'T CALL HER.
I CAN'T CALL HER POCAHONTAS.
SHE DOESN'T QUALIFY.
SHE HAS -- I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR
A LONG TIME, I'VE BEEN SAYING IT
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.
I SAID I HAVE MORE INDIAN BLOOD
THAN SHE HAS AND I HAVE NONE.
I HAVE NONE.
BUT I HAVE MORE THAN SHE HAS.
BUT I CAN'T USE THE NAME
POCAHONTAS ANYMORE.
BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND I WILL
ANYWAY, IS THAT OKAY?
WE GOT TO KEEP HER DOWN.
BUT IN THIS ELECTION, THE PEOPLE
OF TEXAS ARE GOING TO MAKE A
GIANT AND BEAUTIFUL STAND.
YOU'RE GOING TO ELECT A
REPUBLICAN HOUSE AND EVEN
THEY'RE HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM.
THEY'RE GETTING A LITTLE
NERVOUS, RIGHT?
REMEMBER ABOUT A MONTH AGO,
RIGHT?
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS
BLUE WAVE.
OH.
YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT THE BLUE
WAVE.
YOU'RE NOT HEARING SO MUCH.
THE BLUE WAVE IS BEING
DISSIPATED A LITTLE BIT.
I DON'T HEAR THEM -- ARE YOU
GUYS STILL TALKING ABOUT THE
BLUE WAVE?
THE BLUE WAVE.
THAT'S COMING, RIGHT?
BLUE WAVE.
YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT IT TOO
MUCH.
LET ME TELL YOU.
YOU GOT TO GET OUT AND VOTE.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS?
THE PARTY THAT HAS THE
PRESIDENCY, I DON'T KNOW WHY, I
GUESS YOU GET A LITTLE SEDATE, I
GUESS YOU GET A LITTLE
SOMETHING, WHO KNOWS.
YOU LOSE SOMETHING, I DON'T
KNOW.
BUT I THINK TWO TIMES SINCE THE
GREAT DEPRESSION IT WAS A
POSITIVE.
BUT NOBODY EVER HAD THE
CONDITION OF HAVING PRODUCED THE
GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY
OF OUR COUNTRY, RIGHT?
NOBODY.
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WOULD
WE LOSE THE HOUSE?
BUT HISTORICALLY SO HISTORY'S
AGAINST US, BUT THE FACTS ARE
ALL WITH US.
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE.
EARLY VOTING, REMEMBER.
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO GREAT
WITH THE HOUSE AND FANTASTIC
WITH THE SENATE SO THAT WE CAN
KEEP MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
AND YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE
CHANGING.
I LOVE THIS -- I HATE THIS --
LET ME ASK YOUR ADVICE.
TEXAS, YOU'RE SMART.
YOU'RE TOUGH.
WE HAVE MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN.
I THINK IT HAS TO BE THE
GREATEST SLOGAN IN THE HISTORY
OF POLITICS.
RIGHT?
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
WHAT DID SHE HAVE SOME STUPID
SLOGAN LIKE STAY TOGETHER?
AND THEN WHEN I KNOCKED HER --
OR WAS IT LIKE STAY WITH ME?
AND THEN I GOT UP AND SAID SEE?
THAT'S ALL SHE CAN TALK ABOUT IS
HERSELF.
SO THEY PAID $1 MILLION FOR THAT
SLOGAN AND SHE CHANGED IT THE
NEXT MORNING BECAUSE IT WAS A
DISASTER.
STAY WITH ME.
THEY DIDN'T DO THAT.
THEY DECIDED NOT TO.
SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, BUTÃºN-
WE'RE RUNNING, WE'RE DOING GOOD.
YOU KNOW WE'VE CREATED 11.7 --
$1.7 TRILLION -- $11.7 TRILLION.
AND REMEMBER, WE'RE HITTING
CHINA HARD, WE'RE HITTING
EVERYONE HARD.
WE'RE DOING THESE TRADE DEALS.
WHEN THEY ALL KICK IN YOU'LL SEE
NUMBERS LIKE YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE.
BUT WE'VE CREATED $11.7
TRILLION.
OTHER COUNTRIES, CHINA, YOU'VE
NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE WITH
CHINA.
REMEMBER IT WAS ALWAYS CHINA'S
DOING SO GREAT.
CHINA, CHINA, EVERYTHING IS
CHINA.
WELL WHAT ABOUT US?
WE'RE DOWN.
WE'RE NOT DOWN ANYMORE FOLKS.
WE'RE WAY UP.
WE'RE WAY UP.
WAY UP.
AND BY THE WAY -- AND SINCE OUR
ELECTION WE'VE GONE UP ALMOST
50%.
THINK OF IT $11.7 TRILLION WE
CREATED.
CHINA'S LOST ABOUT $20 TRILLION.
WE WANT THEM TO BE HAPPY.
WE WANT THEM TO DO WELL.
BUT THEY HAVE TO TREAT US
FAIRLY.
THEY HAVEN'T TREATED US FAIRLY.
AND THEY WILL.
THEY HAVE A WONDERFUL GREAT
LEADER, PRESIDENT XI, AND THEY
WILL.
THE CHOICE IN NOVEMBER COULD NOT
BE MORE CLEAR.
DEMOCRATS PRODUCE MOBS.
REPUBLICANS PRODUCE JOBS.
RIGHT?
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU EVERYBODY.
IT'S A GREAT STATE.
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE.
AND DID WE EVER HELP YOU?
HONESTLY, DID WE HELP YOU WITH
THAT LOUSY HURRICANE THAT YOU
SUFFERED THROUGH?
THAT SUCKER WAS BRUTAL.
I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT.
IT KEPT COMING IN.
IT WAS TAUNTING US.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TAUNTED?
IT WAS TAUNTING.
IT WOULD COME IN, THEN IT GOES
OUT, IT RELOADS, IT COMES IN.
THEN IT DUMPS.
THEN IT GOES OUT.
THEN IT COMES THREE TIMES.
AND I'M PAYING FOR THAT.
I'M SAYING IS THIS THING EVER
GOING TO STOP?
WILL IT JUST GO AWAY?
THAT WAS A BRUTAL -- THAT WAS A
BRUTAL HURRICANE.
AND YOU KNOW WHO WAS FANTASTIC?
THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD.
YOU KNOW?
BECAUSE THAT WAS A VERY BIG DEAL
AND IT WAS A LOT OF WATER.
AND I DON'T KNOW WHO IN THIS
ROOM DID IT, BUT THESE GUYS WITH
THE LITTLE BOATS THEY THINK THAT
HE HAVE THIS GREAT BOAT.
-- THEY THINK THEY HAVE THIS
GREAT BOAT.
WHERE DO THESE PEOPLE COME FROM?
THEY WANT TO GO OUT AND GO INTO
THE HURRICANE AND SHOW THEIR
WIFE HOW GREAT THEY ARE?
AND THEN THEY GET OUT THERE AND
THEY SAY OH MY GOD, I'M DEAD.
AND I ASKED ONE OF THE COAST
GUARD GUYS, SO LET ME ASK YOU A
QUESTION, WHEN THEY GO OUT -- BY
THE WAY, THE COAST GUARD HARD TO
BELIEVE.
THEY SAVED, IN TEXAS, MORE THAN
ANY OTHER PLACE, FLORIDA HAD A
BAD ONE BUT IT WASN'T THE SAME
KIND.
IN TEXAS THE UNITED STATES COAST
GUARD SAVED 16,000 LIVES.
THINK OF WHAT THAT IS.
THINK OF WHAT THAT IS.
AND I SAID TO A COUPLE OF THE
TOP GUYS, THESE ARE GREAT
PEOPLE.
I SAID LET ME ASK YOU A
QUESTION, WITH THESE BOATS, WHAT
HAPPENS?
>> THEY WANT TO GO OUT, PLAY TO
THE EDGE.
BUT THERE WAS NO EDGE AND IT
GOBBLED THEM UP.
AND THESE GUYS ARE GOING THROUGH
IT.
SO HOW BIG IS A THING LIKE THAT?
YOU HAVE THE GREATEST
EQUIPMENT, THE -- EQUIPMENT,
THE GREATEST BOATS.
WE HIT THAT THING WRONG WE DON'T
HAVE A CHANCE.
HE SAID WE GO DOWN LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE.
THEY WOULD RIDE THE CREST.
THEY CALL IT RIDE THE CREST.
THEY'D BACK UP, LET IT GO BY.
THEY'D COME IN, SAVE A LOT OF
PEOPLE, GO BACK OUT.
THE COAST GUARD, THEIR BRAND HAS
APPRECIATED MORE THAN ANY BRAND
IN THIS COUNTRY T UNITED STATES
COAST GUARD -- COUNTRY, THE
UNITED STATES COAST GUARD.
WE HAVE TO SAY IT.
THEY DID A GREAT JOB.
AND NEXT TIME ALL YOU GUYS AND
GALS WHEN THERE'S A HURRICANE DO
ME A FAVOR, DON'T TAKE YOUR BOAT
OUT.
JUST HEAD OUT OF TOWN FOR A
LITTLE WHILE.
THAT WAS A BRUTAL PERIOD OF
TIME.
BUT YOU DID INCREDIBLY.
AND YOU REALLY -- FEMA WAS
GREAT.
LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS GREAT.
FIRST RESPONDERS WERE GREAT.
THE MILITARY.
BUT THE COAST GUARD REPRESENTED
THE MILITARY.
INCREDIBLE.
SO WE'RE HONORED TO BE JOINED
THIS EVENING BY MANY GREAT
REPUBLICAN LEADERS.
HERE TONIGHT IS A MAN WHO IS
INCREDIBLE.
HE IS A MAN WITH TREMENDOUS
SPIRIT.
HE ASKED ME FOR MORE MONEY THAN
ANY HUMAN BEING HAS EVER ASKED
ME.
I GOT TO TELL YOU, FIRST OF ALL,
HIS NAME HAPPENS TO BE GOVERNOR
GREG ABBOTT.
WHERE IS HE?
WHERE IS HE?
WHERE IS HE?
WHERE IS HE?
WHERE IS GREG?
WHERE IS HE?
HE'S THE GREATEST GUY.
WHERE IS HE?
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS
ROOM.
BUT YOU KNOW, GREG, I JUST TOOK
PICTURES WITH HIM BACKSTAGE.
I THINK -- DO WE LIKE HIM FOR
THAN TRUMP, YES, RIGHT?
NO, YES, I LIKE HIM MORE THAN
ME.
BUT HE CALLED ME UP AND WE HAD
JUST GIVEN BILLIONS AND BILLIONS
OF DOLLARS TO THE STATE OF
TEXAS.
AND HE GOES, MR. PRESIDENT,
COULD I ASK YOU ONE SMALL
QUESTION.
WHAT?
AND HE SAID, SIR, WE'D LIKE TO
BUILD A DAM AND NOT VERY MUCH
MONEY BUT IT WOULD REALLY HELP
US FOR THE NEXT HURRICANE I.
WOULD KEEP THE WATERS OUT OF --
HURRICANE.
IT WOULD KEEP THE WATERS OUT OF
HOUSTON.
IF I COULD I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
FOR THAT MONEY.
WHAT'D YOU GIVE $35, $40
BILLION?
HOW MUCH IS IT?
HE SAID ONLY $10 BILLION.
LISTEN TO THIS.
IT'S ONLY $10 BILLION WITH A B.
I SAID GREG, THAT'S THE MOST
EXPENSIVE DAM I'VE EVER HEARD
OF.
BUT I'LL TELL YOU.
HE LOVES TEXAS.
HE'S HERE SOMEPLACE.
HE LOVES TEXAS.
HE LOVES TEXAS.
HE LOVES THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS.
AND HE'S A GREAT MAN.
AND HE DID A FANTASTIC JOB UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE.
THAT HURRICANE WAS PRESSURE.
AND YOU GOT ALL As AND A PLUSES.
EVERYBODY DID, THE RESPONDERS,
FEMA, THE GOVERNOR.
AND THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, DAN
PATRICK.
DAN?
FINALLY I SEE THEM.
THEY'RE OVER HERE.
IT'S HARD WHEN YOU HAVE 22,000
PEOPLE IN A ROOM IT'S HARD TO
FIND ONE PERSON EVEN WHEN HE'S
TALL.
AND ANOTHER TALL GUY WHO IS AN
INCREDIBLE SENATOR, HE
REPRESENTS YOU SO WELL.
HE'S ALWAYS FIGHTING FOR YOU.
AND HE WAS THE ONE THAT ASKED
DIANNE FEINSTEIN DID YOU LEAK?
REMEMBER?
AND SHE WENT HUH.
SO HE WAS THE ONE.
HE SAID, LOOKS OVER TO HER,
REMEMBER, DURING THE HEARINGS,
THOSE HORRIBLE HEARINGS WHERE
THEY WERE SO NASTY AND HORRIBLE
TO A GREAT GENTLEMAN WHO'S GOING
TO GO DOWN AS ONE OF OUR
GREATEST SUPREME COURT JUSTICES
EVER?
HE GOES OUT AND HE GOES, HE'S ON
THE COMMITTEE, AND HE GOES, DID
YOU LEAK?
AND SHE WENT OH, WHAT, NO.
WAIT A MINUTE, LET ME CHECK.
DID WE LEAK?
NO, WE DIDN'T LEAK.
OH.
UH, NO.
THAT WAS THE WORST BODY
LANGUAGE.
SHE WAS SO GUILTY OF LEAKING.
SHE LEAKED.
JOHN CORNEN WAS GREAT.
HE WAS GREAT DURING THE
HEARINGS.
STAND UP JOHN YOU SURPRISED HER,
RIGHT?
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HECK
HAPPENED.
YOU SURPRISED HER WITH THAT
BEAUTIFUL TEXAS ACCIDENT.
ALWAYS A GREAT JOB, NOT JUST
THERE.
ALWAYS A GREAT JOB.
AND YOU HAVE AN ATTORNEY GENERAL
WHO DOESN'T STOP.
HE'S TOUGH.
HE'S SMART.
HE COLLECTS MORE MONEY FOR THIS
STATE.
HE LOVES THE STATE.
KEN PAXTON.
THANK YOU, KEN.
GREAT JOB.
DOING A GREAT JOB, KEN.
WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOUR
STATE LEADERS IN THE RECOVERY
EFFORT FOLLOWING THE DEVASTATION
OF HARVEY.
WE CONTINUE TO WORK.
DOESN'T GO SO QUICKLY ALTHOUGH,
IN THIS CASE, WENT VERY FAST.
AND WE'RE NEVER GOING TO REST
UNTIL THAT HURRICANE IS TOTALLY
OUT OF OUR SIGHT, OUR VISION,
EVERYTHING'S FIXED, AND IT'S
VERY CLOSE TO BEING FINALIZED.
BUT WE'LL REST UNTIL EVERY LAST
BRICK, EVERY PIECE OF ASPHALT
AND CONCRETE, EVERYTHING IS
PERFECTO, RIGHT?
AND IF WE DID REST, TED CRUZ AND
JOHN CORNYN, AND KEN PAXTON, AND
DAN, I LOVE DAN, WHAT A GREAT
GUY.
THANK YOU.
THEY WILL NOT LET ME REST, WILL
YOU?
THEY'LL NEVER LET ME REST.
WE STAND READY TO HELP TEXAS
RESPOND TO THE STORMS THAT ARE
CONTINUING TO CAUSE FLOODING
THROUGHOUT THE REGION.
AND WE'RE DOING THINGS TO
ALLEVIATE SOME OF THOSE STORMS.
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO
DO THE ONE THAT THE GOVERNOR
ASKS FOR, BUT THAT COULD BE.
I SAID WOULD YOU NAME IT THE
TRUMP DAM PLEASE?
NAME IT THE TRUMP DAM.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S BIG AND EXPENSIVE.
I'M ONLY KIDDING.
I DID NOT ASK HIM THAT.
TOMORROW IT'LL BE HEADLINE,
TRUMP DEMANDS NAME ON THE DAM.
I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE
OUTSTANDING REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSMEN INCLUDING CHAIRMAN
KEVIN BRADY.

THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT
PROTECTING THE SACRED VALUES WE
ALL SHARE AND THE VALUES THAT
TEXAS REPUBLICANS ARE FIGHTING
FOR EACH AND EVERY DAY.
WE BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT TO FREE
SPEECH, THE RIGHT TO RELIGIOUS
LIBERTY, AND WE BELIEVE IN THE
RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS.
WE BELIEVE IN LAW AND ORDER.
AND WE CHERISH THE INCREDIBLE
MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
WE BELIEVE THAT JUDGES SHOULD
ALWAYS INTERPRET THE
CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN.
WE BELIEVE THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD
TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO BE PROUD
OF THEIR COUNTRY AND TO RESPECT
OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG.
WE KNEEL IN PRAYER AND WE
PROUDLY STAND FOR OUR NATIONAL
ANTHEM AND OUR AMERICAN FLAG.
WE KNOW THAT FAITH IN FAMILY,
NOT GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRACY,
ARE THE TRUE CENTER OF AMERICAN
LIFE.
SO TRUE.
AND ABOVE ALL ELSE WE KNOW THIS,
IN AMERICA WE DON'T WORSHIP
GOVERNMENT.
WE WORSHIP GOD.
THESE ARE THE VALUES THAT UNITE
PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE GREAT
STATE OF TEXAS.
IN THIS ELECTION YOU CAN SEND A
MESSAGE TO THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS
DON'T MESS WITH TEXAS.
VOTE FOR TED CRUZ AND VOTE
REPUBLICAN.
A FUTURE UNDER DEMOCRATIC MOB
RULE WOULD BE A TOTAL
CATASTROPHE.
DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS HAVE
ALREADY SIGNED UP FOR A
SOCIALIST TAKEOVER OF HEALTH
CARE THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE
PRIVATE INSURANCE OF MORE THAN
15 MILLION TEXANS.
THE DEMOCRAT PLAN WOULD DESTROY
MEDICARE AND TERMINATE MEDICARE
ADVANTAGE FOR 1.4 MILLION TEXAS
SENIORS WHO DEPEND ON IT.
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT
MEDICARE FOR OUR GREAT SENIORS
WHO HAVE EARNED IT AND WHO HAVE
PAID FOR IT FOR A LONG TIME.
AND REPUBLICANS WILL ALWAYS
PROTECT AMERICANS WITH
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS.
WE PROTECT YOU.
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS, RIGHT?
THE DEMOCRAT PLAN TO DESTROY
AMERICAN HEALTH CARE INCLUDES
FREE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION
TO ILLEGAL ALIENS PAID FOR BY
YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THE
AMERICAN TAXPAYER.
AND THEY ABSOLUTELY DEMAND, AND
THAT'S HAPPENING, THEY WANT TO
B ABLE TO VOTE.
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO VOTE T
ILLEGALS.
BY THE WAY -- VOTE, THE
ILLEGALS.
BY THE WAY, I HATE TO TELL YOU,
YOU GO TO CALIFORNIA THEY VOTE
ANYWAY.
EVERY TIME I SAY IT THE FAKE
NEWS SAYS -- I GOT SO MANY
PEOPLE VOTING ILLEGALLY IN THIS
COUNTRY IT'S A DISGRACE.
VOTER ID, FOLKS.
VOTER ID.
VOTER ID.
YOU GOT TO PUT YOUR VOTER ID YOU
DO IT ON EVERYTHING.
THE ONLY THING YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO IT FOR IS WHEN YOU VOTE.
NOT GOING TO BE THAT WAY.
VOTER ID.
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE WE SHOULD
PROTECT PUBLIC BENEFITS FOR
TRULY NEEDY AMERICANS, NOT FOR
ILLEGAL ALIENS.
AS WE SPEAK, THE DEMOCRAT PARTY
IS OPENLY ENCOURAGING MILLIONS
OF ILLEGAL ALIENS TO BREAK OUR
LAWS, OVERWHELM OUR BORDERS, AND
OVERWHELM OUR NATION.
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE LAUNCHED AN
ASSAULT ON THE SECURITY OF OUR
NATION AND THE SAFETY OF EVERY
SINGLE AMERICAN.
THE CRISIS ON OUR BORDER RIGHT
NOW AS WE SPEAK IS THE SOLE
RESULT OF DEMOCRAT LAWS AND
ACTIVISTS, DEMOCRAT JUDGES THAT
PREVENT US FROM RETURNING
ILLEGAL ALIENS FROM CENTRAL
AMERICA AND ALL OVER THE WORLD.
IT'S CALLED CATCH AND RELEASE.
YOU KNOW WHAT CATCH AND RELEASE
IS, RIGHT?
YOU'VE GOT THESE GREAT PEOPLE
FROM BORDER PATROL.
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE.
I.C.E., BORDER PATROL, THESE ARE
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.
TOUGH JOB.
THEY CATCH THEM AND THEN THEY
RELEASE THEM.
AND THEY SAY, YOU HAVE TO COME
BACK FOR A COURT CASE.
THEY JUST PUT THEIR FOOT OVER.
IMMEDIATELY THEY TOUCH OUR LAND.
YOU HAVE TO COME BACK IN TWO
YEARS FOR A COURT CASE.
WELL, NUMBER ONE, THEY NEVER
COME BACK.
3%.
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THE THREE.
WE RELEASE THEM INTO OUR COUNTRY
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE
DEMOCRATS WANT.
AND THEN A LOT OF BAD THINGS
HAPPEN WHEN THAT HAPPENS.
THE DEMOCRATS DON'T CARE WHAT
THEIR EXTREMIST IMMIGRATION
AGENDA WILL DO TO YOUR
NEIGHBORHOODS, TO YOUR
HOSPITALS, OR TO YOUR SCHOOLS.
THEY DON'T CARE THAT THE MASS
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION WILL TOTALLY
BANKRUPT OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE ALL
THE DEMOCRATS CARE ABOUT IS
REGAINING POWER NO MATTER HOW
THEY HAVE TO GO ABOUT DOING IT.
ALL THE WITCH HUNTS NO MATTER
WHAT THEY DO THEY JUST WANT TO
GAIN POWER.
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THEM
GAIN POWER.
AND THAT'S WHY THE DEMOCRATS ALL
SUPPORT CATCH AND RELEASE.
THAT'S WHY THEY SUPPORT VISA
LOTTERY.
YOU KNOW WHAT VISA LOTTERY IS?
COUNTRIES PUT NAMES IN A BATCH
AND YOU PICK THEM.
YOU PICK THEM.
YOU KEEP PICKING THEM.
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT NOTHING BUT
PROBLEMS BECAUSE YOU THINK THOSE
COUNTRIES ARE PUTTING THEIR
FINEST?
I DON'T THINK SO.
IT'S A GREAT WAY TO DISPOSE OF
THEIR PROBLEMS.
VISA LOTTERY.
AND THEN YOU HAVE CHAIN
MIGRATION.
A GUY COMES IN AS AN EXAMPLE
WEST SIDE HIGHWAY IN MANHATTAN.
THAT'S WHERE I AM.
BEAUTIFUL PARK.
BURTFUL HIGHWAY.
-- BEAUTIFUL HIGHWAY.
THIS ANIMAL'S DRIVING A CAR DOWN
AND HE DECIDES HE'S GOING TO
MAKE A RIGHT RIGHT INTO THE PARK
WHERE EVERYONE'S WORKING OUT,
EXERCISING, RUNNING, BICYCLING,
AND HE KNOCKS EVERYTHING DOWN.
INCLUDING KILLS EIGHT PEOPLE.
AND BADLY WOUNDS -- YOU EVER
NOTICE THEY NEVER TALK ABOUT THE
PEOPLE WHO ARE WOUNDED WHERE
THEY LOSE THEIR ARMS AND THEIR
LEGS AND THEIR LIVES CAN NEVER
BE THE SAME.
THEY NEVER TALK.
THEY SAY EIGHT PEOPLE DIED.
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE 12
PEOPLE THAT LOST SOMETHING SO
IMPORTANT.
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN A
PARK WHERE THEY GO TO EXERCISE
SO THEY CAN BE IN PERFECT SHAPE.
AND THEY GO HOME MONTHS LATER
WITHOUT THEIR LEGS, WITHOUT
THEIR ARMS.
BECAUSE THIS ANIMAL GOING AT A
VERY FAST SPEED JUST DECIDED
HE'S GOING TO MAKE A RIGHT INTO
THE PARK AND RUN PEOPLE OVER.
SO HE HAS 22 PEOPLE THAT CAME IN
BECAUSE HE'S HERE.
SO HE'S HERE.
IT'S CALLED CHAIN.
A CHAIN.
NICE NAME, CHAIN MIGRATION.
HE'S HERE.
HIS MOTHER COMES WITH HIM.
HIS FATHER THEN COMES.
HIS UNCLE.
HIS AUNT.
HIS BROTHER.
HIS NEPHEWS.
HIS SISTER.
22 PEOPLE.
NO JOBS.
JUST 22 PEOPLE.
NO MORE CHAIN MIGRATION.
NO MORE CHAIN MIGRATION.
THAT'S WHY THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO
GIVE ILLEGAL ALIENS FREE WELFARE
AND THE RIGHT TO VOTE.
THAT'S WHY DEMOCRATS WANT TO
ABOLISH I.C.E.
THE CASUALTIES OF THE DEMOCRAT'S
OPEN BORDER CREW SAID, AND
YOU'RE GOING TO -- CRUSADE, AND
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IT OVER THE
NEXT TWO WEEKS.
I WANT TO CHANGE IT.
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH VOTES.
AS AN EXAMPLE, WITH THE SENATE
WE NEED 60 VOTES.
WELL, WE HAVE 51.
WE HAVE A TINY MAJORITY.
WE NEED 60 VOTES.
SO THEY DON'T ALLOW US TO DO IT.
THEY'RE KILLING AND HURTING
INNOCENT AMERICANS.
DEMOCRAT IMMIGRATION POLICIES
ALLOW POISONOUS DRUGS AND MS-13
TO POUR INTO OUR COUNTRY.
AND DEMOCRAT SANCTUARY CITIES
RELEASE VIOLENT CRIMINALS FROM
JAIL AND STRAIGHT INTO YOUR
NEIGHBORHOODS.
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR
LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT FOR
CRIMINAL ALIENS.
COMMON SENSE.
COMMON SENSE.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL ALWAYS
STAND PROUDLY WITH THE HEROES OF
I.C.E.
THESE ARE TOUGH PEOPLE.
BY THE WAY, THEY'RE GREAT
AMERICANS.
BUT YOU DON'T WANT THEIR JOB.
THEY GO INTO, THEY CALL THEM
NESTS, MS-13, KILLERS.
THEY DON'T LIKE USING GUNS
BECAUSE IT'S TOO QUICK.
THEY LIKE CUTTING PEOPLE UP.
SLICING THEM.
KILLING THEM LIKE THEY DID TO
TWO BEAUTIFUL, LOVELY YOUNG
GIRLS GOING BACK HOME FROM
SCHOOL.
KILLING THEM, SLICING THEM.
THEY DIDN'T WANT THE GUNS.
THESE ARE EVIL PEOPLE.
YEAH.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT.
HE SAID IT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY'RE ANIMALS.
THEY'RE ANIMALS.
SO YOU KNOW, WHEN I SEE LONG
ISLAND, I GREW UP NEAR LONG
ISLAND AND I KNOW EVERY TOWN OUT
THERE.
FOR SOME REASON A LOT OF THE
MS-13 WENT OUT TO LONG ISLAND
AND I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM
FRIENDS OF MINE.
AND WE PUT I.C.E.
IN THERE AND
IT'S LIKE YOU LIBERATE -- IT'S
LIKE A WAR.
YOU LIBERATE THE TOWN.
AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE CLAPPING
AND SCREAMING.
AND THESE GUYS ON I.C.E.
THEY
WALK RIGHT INTO THOSE NESTS AND
THEY'RE TOUGHER AND SMARTER THAN
MS-13.
AND MS-13 RESPECTS THEM.
BECAUSE NONE OF YOU GUYS WANT
THAT JOB.
I DON'T WANT THAT JOB.
MAYBE LOUIE GOMERT WILL TAKE IT.
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT I DON'T WANT THAT JOB.
I DON'T WANT THAT JOB.
BUT SERIOUSLY, THESE ARE HEROES.
AND THEY GO IN AND THEY TAKE
THEM AND THEY THROW THEM INTO
THE PADDY WAGON THEN GET THEM
THE HECK OUT OF OUR COUNTRY.
WE REMOVE THOUSANDS OF THEM.
THEY CAME IN THROUGH THE
WONDERFUL OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
WE
AND LAW-ENFORCEMENT. 
AND YES, WE ARE GETTING THE 
WORLD FINISHED BECAUSE IT IS AN 
IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF WHAT WE 
NEED. 
 EVEN 
THE DEMOCRATS ARE SEEING IT. 
I GOT A CALL TODAY,  THE GUY 
SAID, YOU KNOW, WE REALLY DO 
NEED IT. 
WHEN HE SEES THOSE PEOPLE 
POURING. 
WE HAVE TO HAVE A WALL. 
IF YOU WANT TO SECURE OUR 
BORDERS, SUPPORT OUR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, STOP CATCH AND 
RELEASE, AND ALL OF THE OTHER 
THINGS I SPOKE ABOUT, VOTE 
REPUBLICAN. 
DO IT NOW ON -- OR ON NOVEMBER 
6. IF YOU WANT AMERICA TO 
ENDURE AS A SOVEREIGN, 
INDEPENDENT NATION, GO OUT AND 
VOTE REPUBLICAN, AND IF YOU 
WANT HIGH-PAYING JOBS, RISING 
WAGES, AND A BOOMING ECONOMY, 
THEN GO OUT AND VOTE REPUBLICAN.
 IN LESS 
THAN 2 YEARS, TIME,  WE HAVE 
CREATED OVER 4.2 MILLION NEW 
JOBS AND LIFTED OVER 4 MILLION 
AMERICANS OFF OF FOOD STAMPS. 
THEY SAID THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. 
WE HAVE ADDED 600,000 NEW 
MANUFACTURING JOBS, REMEMBER? 
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION? 
I WILL NOT BE SPECIFIC, BUT 
LET'S SAY THE HEAD OF THE 
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION -- DOES 
ANYBODY KNOW WHO I'M TALKING 
ABOUT? 
REMEMBER? 
HE SAID YOU'D -- YOU CANNOT 
HAVE MANUFACTURING JOBS IN THIS 
COUNTRY. 
YOU WOULD NEED A MAGIC WAND. 
I GUESS WE HAVE FOUND THE MAGIC 
WAND. 
THE BEST JOBS THERE ARE. 
THE BEST JOBS THERE ARE. 
AND MANUFACTURING CONFIDENCE, 
JUST TODAY, HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH
, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.
ECONOMIC GROWTH, LAST QUARTER, 
REACHED 4.2%. 
REMEMBER? 
4.1%, THEN ELEVATED TO 4.2%. 
THEY SAID THAT WHEN THAT HAPPEN 
-- THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN FOR 
MANY YEARS. 
WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE COMING UP. 
WE HAVE AN INTEREST RATE 
CLIMATE, WE DO NOT HAVE 0% 
INTEREST RATE -- RATES. 
IF YOU WANT TO SEE NUMBERS. 
WEARE BEING CONSERVATIVE. 
HISPANIC AMERICAN MEDIAN 
HOUSEHOLD INCOME -- AMERICA -- 
HISPANIC AMERICAN, THINK OF IT, 
MEDIAN INCOME REACHED AN ALL-
TIME HIGH. 
HISPANIC AMERICAN POVERTY HAS 
REACHED AN ALL-TIME LOW. 
AND HISPANIC AMERICAN 
HOMEOWNERSHIP RICH -- RECENTLY 
HIT AS HIGH -- IT'S HIGHEST 
RATE IN MORE THAN A DECADE. 
  
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC 
AMERICAN, ASIAN AMERICAN, 
UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED THE 
LOWEST LEVEL EVER RECORDED IN 
OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. 
AND, WOMEN'S DEPLOYMENT JUST 
FELL TO 3.6%, THE LOWEST RATE 
IN 65 YEARS. 
  
EARLIER THIS MONTH I ANNOUNCED 
THAT WE ARE REPLACING THE 
HORRIBLE NAFTA DEAL WITH AN 
INCREDIBLE, BRAND-NEW U.S., 
MEXICO, CANADA AGREEMENT, THE 
U.S.M.C.A..  
THAT IS A GREAT DEAL, THE 
FARMERS ARE HAPPY, OUR 
MANUFACTURERS ARE HAPPY. 
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE 
COMPANY LEAVING FOR OTHER 
COUNTRIES, A VERY IMPORTANT 
PART OF THE DEAL. 
I SAID, I DO NOT WANT OUR 
COMPANIES MOVING TO OTHER 
COUNTRIES, FIRING ALL OF THEIR 
PEOPLE, NICKING THE PRODUCT, 
AND THEN PUTTING IT IN WITH NO 
TAX, AND SELLING IT BACK TO OUR 
PEOPLE. 
IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. 
THAT DEAL TOTALLY TAKES CARE OF 
IT. 
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. 
NO MORE, NO MORE. 
WE LOST 35% OF OUR AUTOMOBILE 
BUSINESS, IN A SHORT PERIOD OF 
TIME. 
NAFTA WAS A DISASTER. 
THAT IS WHY I REFUSED. 
THEY WANTED TO CALL IT NAFTA 2. 
I SAID I DO NOT WANT NAFTA 
ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT WE DID. 
IT IS A GREAT DEAL, SO MANY 
PEOPLE WORKED SO HARD ON IT. 
WE HAVE TAKEN THE TOUGHEST EVER 
ACTION TO CRACK DOWN ON CHINA'S 
ABUSIVE TRADE PRACTICES. 
WE HAVE ALSO MADE A DEAL WITH 
SOUTH KOREA, THE NEW TRADE 
DEAL, IT IS A GREAT DEAL FOR 
FARMERS, MANUFACTURERS, 
EVERYBODY. 
WE'VE TAKEN BOLD ACTION TO 
REDUCE THE PRICE OF 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, AMERICANS 
SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO 
SUBSIDIZE LOWER DRUG PRICES IN 
FOREIGN COUNTRIES, WHILE PAYING 
THE HIGHEST DRUG PRICES EVER, 
IN THE HISTORY OF THIS WORLD. 
  WE 
HAVE GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS, 
IT IS A STATUTORY PROCESS, I AM 
VERY SOON FINISHED WITH IT. 
DRUG PRICES WILL SOON BE 
PLUNGING. 
WATCH. 
  
SECRETARY AZAR, A GREAT JOB. 
WE JUST PASSED  RIGHT TO DRIVE. 
TO KNOW WHAT THAT IS? 
THAT IS A PERSON WHO IS VERY 
SICK. 
THEY ARE TERMINALLY ILL. 
THEY WANT HOPE. 
THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET 
SOMETHING. 
WE HAVE THE GREATEST MEDICAL 
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, BY FAR. 
WE HAVE THE GREATEST THINGS 
UNDER -- THEY ARE LOOKING -- 
UNDER RESEARCH. 
WHAT HAPPENED IS PEOPLE WOULD 
BE TOLD THE -- THEY ARE 
TERMINALLY ILL, THEY HAVE A BIG 
PROBLEM. 
IF WE HAD A DRUG OR TREATMENT 
THAT GAVE GREAT HOPE, THAT 
LOOKED PROMISING, WE COULD NOT 
EVEN COME CLOSE TO LETTING THE 
MUSIC. 
AND, FOR 40 FOR YEARS THEY HAVE 
BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS DONE. 
IF SOMEBODY IS REALLY SICK, 
TERMINALLY ILL, AND WE HAVE 
SOMETHING IN THE PIPELINE THAT 
LOOKS REALLY GOOD, WE ARE GOING 
TO LET THE MUSIC. 
IT IS CALLED RIGHT TO TRY. 
I KNOW THAT PEOPLE DRIVE ALL 
OVER THE WORLD, LOOKING FOR 
HELP. 
AND NOW, THEY SIGN A SIMPLE 
DOCUMENT, AND THEY GO OUT AND 
THEY GET IT. 
BY THE WAY, THIS WAS SIGNED 3 
MONTHS AGO. 
WE HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS RESULTS, 
ALREADY. 
AND YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE OTHER 
THINGS, JOHN, BECAUSE JOHN WAS 
VERY MUCH INVOLVED, AND DEAD -- 
TED -- IT IS ONE OF THE 
ULTIMATE TESTS. 
IT WAS VERY HARD TO GET 
APPROVED. 
WE GOT IT APPROVED, IT IS DONE. 
RIGHT TO TRY. 
I HOPE NOBODY HAS TO USE IT. 
I HOPE NOBODY HAS TO USE IT, 
OKAY? 
STAY AWAY. 
YOU KNOW WHAT? 
IF YOU ARE REALLY SICK AND 
THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE 
PIPELINE THAT IS GOOD, YOU 
NEVER HAD A CHANCE, NOW YOU GET 
IT. 
  AND, 
WE OBTAINED $6 BILLION TO FIGHT 
THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC, WHICH IS A 
BIG PROBLEM. 
AND WITH TED, I WILL TELL YOU 
HE WAS INCREDIBLE. 
WITH TED'S HELP, WE REPEALED 
OBAMACARE, THE INDIVIDUAL 
MANDATE PENALTY THAT EVERYBODY 
HATED. 
IT IS GONE. 
EVERYBODY HATED IT. 
IT IS GONE. 
WE PASSED VETERANS CHOICE, 
GIVING OUR VETERANS THE RIGHT 
TO SEE A PRIVATE DOCTOR, 
INSTEAD OF WAITING ON LINE -- 
IN LINE 41-2 MONTHS, 3 MONTHS, 
4 MONTHS. 
AND, HAVING A SIMPLE ILLNESS 
CORRECTED, WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT 
STAND IN LINE, SO LONG, THEY 
WOULD HAVE A SIMPLE PROBLEM AND 
BY THE TIME THEY GOT TO SEE A 
DOCTOR, THEY WERE TERMINALLY 
ILL. 
TERMINALLY ILL. 
NOW, IF OUR VETERANS HAVE TO 
WAIT IN LINE, THEY GO OUT AND 
THEY SAY A PRIVATE DOCTOR. 
WE PAY THE BILL. 
 AND, WE 
GET THEM FIXED UP. 
WE ALSO PASSED, FOR THE 
VETERANS, THE V.A. 
ACCOUNTABILITY  BILL, EVERYBODY 
WHO MISTREATS VETERANS WILL BE 
ACCOUNTABLE. 
IN OTHER WORDS, JIM, GET OUT OF 
HERE, YOU ARE FIRED. 
GET OUT OF HERE. 
YOU COULD NOT FIRE THESE 
PEOPLE. 
YOU COULD NOT FIRE THEM. 
THEY COULD BE THIEVES, THEY 
COULD DO WHATEVER THEY WANTED 
TO DO. 
YOU COULD NOT FIRE THEM. 
AND FOR THE MILITARY, WE 
SECURED $700 BILLION, AND $760 
BILLION, TWO FULLY REBUILD -- 
TO FULLY REBUILD THE UNITED ÃºST 
WE ARE GETTING OTHER COUNTRY TO 
-- COUNTRIES TO PAY OUT AND PAY 
THEIR FAIR SHARE FOR OUR 
MILITARY PRODUCTION. 
INCLUDING NATO, WHERE I ASKED 
TO RECOVER BILLIONS AND 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, IN JUST 2 
YEARS I HAVE ASKED THEM -- YOU 
HAVE TO PAY A. WE ARE 
PROTECTING YOU, YOU HAVE TO 
PAY. 
THEY WERE NOT PAYING. 
CLOSE TO $100 BILLION A YEAR, 
WE GOT IT. 
THAT THEY PAY. 
WE DO NOT PAY, THEY PAY. 
WE ARE PROTECTING THEM. 
WE ARE PROTECTING THEM, AND 
THAT IS GREAT. 
BUT THEY HAVE TO PAY. 
AND MY DIRECTION -- THE 
PENTAGON IS NOW WORKING TO 
CREATE THE 6th BRANCH OF THE 
AMERICAN ARMED FORCES, THE 
SPACE FORCE. 
IT IS SO IMPORTANT. 
 SO 
IMPORTANT.  
I AM TELLING YOU. 
RIGHT, JOHN? 
THEY WILL GET THAT THROUGH. 
SEE THE WAY PEOPLE LOVE IT? 
IT IS SO IMPORTANT, IT IS WHERE 
IT THAT. 
IT IS REALLY WHERE IT IS AT. 
TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE FROM 
TERRORISM, WE ARE PUTTING IN 
PLACE THE TRAVEL BAN, REMEMBER 
THAT? 
RECENTLY UPHELD BY THE UNITED 
STATES SUPREME COURT. 
REMEMBER THAT? 
THEY WILL NEVER GET IT 
APPROVED, MR. PRESIDENT. 
LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT. 
WE JUST GOT IT APPROVED BY THE 
UNITED STATES COURT. 
I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES 
FROM THE HORRIBLE, ONE-SIDED 
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. 
AND, WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE 
CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND OPENED 
THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN 
JERUSALEM. 
  
TOGETHER, WE HAVE MADE 
EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS. 
BUT, WE ARE JUST HITTING 
STARTED. 
IF YOU VOTE TO ELECT A 
REPUBLICAN HOUSE AND A 
REPUBLICAN SENATE, WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO CUT YOUR TAXES, CUT 
YOUR REGULATIONS, RAISE YOUR 
INCOME, HELP YOUR JOBS, TAKE 
CARE OF YOUR MEDICAL PROBLEMS, 
WE WILL PROTECT MEDICARE AND 
SOCIAL SECURITY, THE DEMOCRATS 
WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO IT. 
WE WILL DEFEND THE SECOND 
AMENDMENT, AND WE WILL CONTINUE 
TO CONFIRM GREAT JUDGES, WHO 
WILL ABIDE BY OUR LAWS AND OUR 
CONSTITUTION. 
  WE 
WILL FULLY SECURE OUR BORDER, 
WE WILL PASS CATES -- FOUR. 
WE WILL STOP SANCTUARY CITIES, 
WE WILL STOP VISA LOTTERY, WE 
WILL AND CHAIN MIGRATION, AND 
WE WILL KEEP THE CRIMINAL DRUG 
DEALERS, PREDATORS THE OUT OF 
OUR COUNTRY.  
  WE 
WILL LIFT MILLIONS OF OUR 
CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK, 
FROM DEPENDENCE -- DEPENDENTS 
TO INDEPENDENCE . FOR YEARS YOU 
HAVE WATCHED AS OUR LEADERS 
HAVE APOLOGIZED TO AMERICA. 
THEY HAVE APOLOGIZED. 
NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS 
STANDING UP FOR AMERICA, AND WE 
ARE STANDING UP FOR THE GREAT 
STATE OF -- TEXAS. 
  BUT, 
TO CONTINUE THIS INCREDIBLE 
MOMENTUM, TO PROTECT YOUR STATE 
AND YOUR COUNTRY, YOU NEED TO 
ELECT A REPUBLICAN HOUSE AND A 
REPUBLICAN SENATE, AND YOU NEED 
TO VOTE FOR TED CRUZ. HE IS A 
TERRIFIC, GREAT CENTER. 
  LOYAL 
CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED TO 
BUILD THIS COUNTRY, AND 
TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR 
COUNTRY. RETURNING POWER TO 
YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THAT 
IS WHAT HAPPENED. 
  THERE 
WAS THE GREATEST MOVEMENT IN 
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED? 
LOOK AT THIS AS AN EXAMPLE, A 
PRESIDENT WOULD COME TO TEXAS 
AND IF THEY HAD 3-400 PEOPLE IN 
A ROOM IN A HOTEL IT WOULD BE 
CONSIDERED A SUCCESS. 
WE HAD OVER 100,000 PEOPLE THAT 
WANTED TO COME HERE TODAY. 
OVER 100,000. 
  THE 
GREATEST MOVEMENT IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, AND IT 
IS YOUR MOVEMENT, MUCH MORE 
THAN IT IS MY MOVEMENT. I AM 
LAYING IT OUT, TELLING IT LIKE 
IT IS. 
FROM HOUSTON TO AUSTIN, FROM 
DALLAS TO EL PASO, FROM THE RED 
RIVER, TO THE RIO GRANDE, THIS 
STATE WAS SETTLED BY SOME OF 
THE TOUGHEST MEN AND STRONGEST 
WOMEN EVER TO WALK THE FACE OF 
THE EARTH. 
  THIS 
IS THE STATE WHERE WILLIAM 
TRAVIS, AND DAVY CROCKETT MADE 
THEIR LAST STAND AT THE ALAMO. 
THIS IS THE STATE WHERE A SMALL 
BAND OF PATRIOTS, AT THE BATTLE 
OF GONZALEZ, ARMED WITH A 
SINGLE CANNON, STANDDOWN A 
FOREIGN ARMY, AND DECLARE -- 
DECLARED "COME AND TAKE IT!" 
  ", 
TAKE IT!" 
THEY SAID. 
COME ON UP AND TAKE IT. 
COME ON. WHAT HAPPENED? 
THEY DID NOT WANT TO TAKE. 
TEXAS IS THE STATE WHERE 
GENERATIONS OF FARMERS AND 
RANCHERS, AND OIL WORKERS, AND 
PIONEERS A LIFE, AND A HOME 
WITH THEIR OWN TWO HANDS. 
THEY DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF 
MONEY, THEY DID NOT HAVE A LOT 
OF LUXURY, BUT THEY ALL HAD ONE 
THING IN COMMON, THEY LOVED 
THEIR FAMILIES, THEY LEFT THEIR 
COUNTRY, AND THEY LOVED THEIR 
GOD.    
THESE COURAGEOU TEXAS PATRIOTS 
DID NOT SHED THEIR BLOOD, 
SWEAT, AND TEARS SO THAT WE 
COULD SIT AT HOME WHILE OTHERS 
TRY TO ERASE THEIR LEGACY, TEAR 
DOWN OUR HISTORY, AND DESTROY 
OUR PROUD AMERICAN HERITAGE. 
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR FREEDOM, 
AND FOR THE SAKE OF OUR 
CHILDREN, WE ARE GOING TO WORK, 
WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT, AND WE 
ARE GOING TO WIN, WIN, WIN, AND 
GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING. 
  WE 
WILL NOT BEND, WE WILL NOT 
BREAK, WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN, 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP, AND WE 
WILL NEVER BACK DOWN, WE WILL 
NEVER SURRENDER. 
AND, WE WILL ALWAYS FIGHT ON TO 
VICTORY. 
  
BECAUSE WE ARE AMERICA, AND OUR 
HEARTS BLEED RED, WHITE, AND 
BLUE. WE ARE ONE PEOPLE, ONE 
FAMILY, AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION 
UNDER GOD. 
AND TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE 
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG 
AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.
AND, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
THANK YOU, TEXAS! 
THANK YOU.
