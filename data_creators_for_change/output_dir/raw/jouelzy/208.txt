45
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,640
at the beginning of it it breaks down

46
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,710
like your monthly refractions like how

47
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,880
are you different between this past

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,340
month of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> before what was your most</font>

49
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,170
memorable part of this month what were

50
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,960
the three biggest lessons you learned

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,250
and it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happy like</font>

52
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,830
reflect on like where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've come from</font>

53
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">and where you're going and to really</font>

54
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:05,540
prioritize your time and I only priority

55
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,220
that ties your time but allows you to

56
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,840
feel productive about how you spending

57
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,669
your time so that we don't undervalue

58
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,100
our own time and I really do<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

59
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,569
journal I need to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the habit of</font>

60
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,510
using it much more frequently but I'm

61
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,430
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's already had a great</font>

62
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,560
impact I despise the concept that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

63
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,910

64
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,069
