00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,250
Hey, this is Rian Johnson.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,200
I wrote and directed
“Star Wars:

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,200
The Last Jedi."

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,120
So this is the Battle
of Crait, which

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,760
is the big battle at
the end of the movie.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,850
And here, we wanted
to make these craft

7
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,410
that they’re in,
these ski speeders,

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,130
as rickety as possible.

9
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,350
Everything from the sound design
to the way ILM animated them —

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,260
you can just see everything
is wobbling on these things,

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,700
even having the open canopy so
our heroes feel very exposed.

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,900
And you just want to feel like
this is David versus Goliath.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,690
Even them falling apart, this
little gag here, just feeling

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,950
like, what are they doing?

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,460
They’re in basically
rolling lawnmowers going up

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,980
against these massive tanks.

17
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,690
Bob Ducsay, our
editor, cut together

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,990
this little Star Wars-y
montage, which I love so much.

19
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,050
It just feels like our brave
heroes going into battle.

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,930
And then I love this
moment with Kelly.

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,070
It’s so relatable.

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,800
It’s a big, heroic moment,
but you see she’s scared.

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,750
And then you see that
she takes some strength

24
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,867
and goes into battle.

25
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:05,700
So this is all about
geography, this big pan

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,470
here, establishing very
clearly the two lines of battle

27
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,050
and establishing the door right
there that’s the objective.

28
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,300
And that’s why we do
these camera moves that

29
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,790
are very wide-angle
lenses and very clearly

30
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,890
show you the layout
of everything —

31
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,020
so that when we
get into the battle

32
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,040
here, when the fighters come
and you see, once again,

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,060
our heroes don’t have a chance,
it’s like hawks versus mice,

34
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,100
we can just go nuts
and get into the fun

35
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,214
of the red and the white.

36
00:01:34,214 --> 00:01:35,880
The red and white
landscape — originally

37
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,170
it was something I came up with
because in a PG-13 Star Wars

38
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,840
movie, you can’t really show
the violence of a battle.

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,280
You can’t show blood.

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,680
And the idea of the
landscape expressing

41
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,930
that violence in a
very bold, graphic way

42
00:01:48,930 --> 00:00:00,000
was something I thought
could be interesting.
