teachers in the state of Oklahoma are planning a walkout on April 2nd in response to the low amount of money that they're paid in their salaries and the fact that many of them haven't received raises in as long as a decade now the Oklahoma Education Association called for teachers to walk out of their classrooms on April 2nd and it'll actually be the day after the state legislature is required to pass an education budget now the teachers are calling for a $10,000 raise for teachers over three years as well as a two hundred million dollar increase in funding for education which has been cut by two 28.2% since 2008 now as I mentioned there have been teachers working in Oklahoma for as long as 10 years and they haven't received a single raise in that period of time which is ludicrous now the average high school teacher in Oklahoma makes about forty two thousand four hundred sixty dollars which ranks 50th in the nation for teacher salaries now what are lawmakers in Oklahoma planning to do when they pass legislation in response to all of this well the Oklahoma House this week passed a package that would give teachers at least a $5,000 raise and raise taxes in the state for the first time since 1990 it hasn't become law yet and it doesn't include an increase in school funding now I think it's important to show you the face of this movement some of the faces in this movement Lauren or I'm sorry and Lindsey Stewart is one of these teachers and her story really broke my heart vice News spoke to her and she shared what her experience has been like being an educator in Oklahoma take a look I think the plan to walk out on April 2nd is unnecessary I don't want to call it a necessary evil Lindsay Stuart is a teacher at Bartlesville High School but still has to work two jobs to make ends meet this year she will make thirty four thousand nine hundred twenty nine dollars teaching a salary that hasn't increased since she started teaching ten years ago my life as a teacher is not just a teacher I have to work a second job so I'm a teacher and a photographer so my morning starts around 5:00 a.m. and then they end around 8:00 p.m. with picking up my daughter from gymnastics and then 10 p.m. with all the editing that I have to do for photography so in between then I teach for seven hours and then I take my kids to their extracurricular activities and then do my photo sessions and then do my editing for my clients for photography so my life as a teacher is very hectic so Lindsay wakes up and from the moment she wakes up to the moment she goes to sleep she is working and working hard to support herself and her daughter and in this next video she talks about how she wants her daughter to look at her and be proud and she doesn't feel like that's the case because of the situation she's in struggling and working two jobs take a look a daughter is very active in gymnastics and is an advanced gymnast this is what her dream is and so my job as her parent is to make sure they do everything possible to nourish that dream and I'm like every other teacher in the state we're just trying to pay our bills I don't think any teacher goes into the profession and thinks oh my gosh I'm gonna be a millionaire but we also don't think that we're gonna we get that close to poverty I want to be proud that I'm a teacher and I want my own children to be proud of me so I will continue to fight because I know I'm worth more and I know when students are worth more that's a heartbreaking video it is heartbreaking and we have to teeth we have to pay these teachers a living wage and hearing about these teachers who have to supplement supplies for their students with monies at their own pockets that goes on in in cities and municipalities across the country it's just wrong and then when you look what's happening in Oklahoma that's disgusting I had they haven't had a pay raise and one decade in ten years in ten years and all they've experienced is you know cuts to funding for their school districts and what I love is that they're standing up that they're rising up and they're fighting and that they're not gonna be happy with the $5,000 raise proposal by lawmakers in their state they want more they want funding for their schools and there have been teachers in other states that have also stood up and have won their battles successfully West Virginia is another example teachers in West Virginia were not having it they were tired of it and so they did the strikes and did what was necessary to get the funding that they needed to get the raises that they needed to do their jobs effectively so we're talking about the future of the country we're talking about the nation's youth and making sure that we are competitive globally and the only way to do that is to make sure that we provide quality education for our young people and we're not doing that we're not prioritizing that we're funding military contractors private contractors you know wasting all of this money to Pat their pockets but when are we actually gonna use taxpayer money to take care of our own when are we gonna use taxpayer money to not benefit corporations but benefit our kids and make sure that they have a quality education this is maddening and the idea that someone would work full time as an educator and then have to take up a second job as a photographer just to provide for herself and her family is is uncalled for we need to do something to change this and I love that the teachers are fighting back they have my full support Bravo you just watch the video by the
