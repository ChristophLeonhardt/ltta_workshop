00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:04,569
INTERESTING NEWS COMING OUT OF
THE HILL AND MANY OTHER PLACES.

2
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:07,539
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS THEY
EXPLAINED, WHO BATTLED

3
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:10,670
HILLARY CLINTON IN THE 2016
DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY AND

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,290
CREATED A REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT
AMONG MILLENNIAL'S, IS

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,290
HAVING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN.

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,290
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW.

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:21,070
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
FIREWORKS.

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,690
LET'S GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS.

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,060
JEFF WEAVER, BERNIE SANDERS THE
FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,729
SAYS HE IS KEEPING THE DOOR
OPEN.

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,000
BERNIE SANDERS ASSOCIATE SAYING,
IS HE CONSIDERING RUNNING

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,270
FOR PRESIDENT?

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,460
YES, IS THE ANSWER.

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,829
HOW IS THAT FOR CLEAR?

15
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:46,210
THE SAME ASSOCIATE CONTINUES, HE
THINKS HE'S EARNED THE RIGHT TO

16
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,440
RUN AGAIN, AND HE BELIEVES IF HE
WOULD'VE BEEN THE DEMOCRATIC

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,170
CANDIDATE HE WOULD HAVE ONE
AGAINST TRUMP, GIVEN THAT HE HAD

18
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,650
A 12 POINT LEAD ON ELECTION DAY,
THAT CERTAINLY IS FAR MORE

19
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,750
LIKELY THAN WHAT HAPPENED WITH
HILLARY CLINTON.

20
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,970
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

21
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,989
ONE MORE QUOTE FROM THE SAME
ASSOCIATE, THE LAST THING

22
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,069
HE IS GOING TO DO IS STEP ASIDE
AND LET JOE BIDEN TAKE IT.

23
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,069
OF COURSE, WHY SHOULD HE?

24
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,460
HE IS THE MOST POPULAR
POLITICIAN IN THE COUNTRY.

25
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,259
ON WHAT PLANET SHOULD THE MOST
POPULAR GUY STEP ASIDE FOR

26
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,310
PEOPLE WHO ARE LESS POPULAR?

27
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,710
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT
ALL IN THE CONTEXT OF

28
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,149
POLITICS BUT TO BE FAIR, THERE
IS AGE ISSUE, WHEREAS JOE

29
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:25,180
BIDEN IS A SPRING CHICKEN.

30
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,420
NO RIGHT, JOE BIDEN IS ONLY ONE
YEAR YOUNGER THAN BERNIE

31
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,329
SANDERS DIVE YOU THINK HE
SHOULDN'T RUN BECAUSE OF AGE,

32
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:34,430
YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY PRESSURE
JOE BIDEN'S GET OUT OF THE RACE.

33
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,439
BUT NOBODY IS DOING THAT.

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,439
NOBODY BRINGS OF JOE BIDEN'S AGE
EVEN OF THEIR PRETTY MUCH

35
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,569
THE SAME AGE.

36
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,749
IT IS ALMOST LIKE THEY DON'T
LIKE BERNIE SANDERS, AND

37
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:47,340
ARE MAKING UP EXCUSES.

38
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,399
I HAVE MORE ON THAT IN A LITTLE
BIT.

39
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:52,399
IS HE RUNNING?

40
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,610
THERE ARE A LOT OF TALE TELL
SIGNS.

41
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,020
EARLIER THIS MONTH, HE TRAVELED
IOWA FOR THE FIRST TIME

42
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,909
SINCE LOSING THE STATES
COCKINESS CAUCUSES TO

43
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,850
CLINTON DURING THE DEMOCRATIC
PRIMARY.

44
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,619
HE GAVE A KEYNOTE ADDRESS AT AN
EVENT SPONSORS BY THE IOWA

45
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:05,009
CITY CITIZENS FOR COMMUNITY
IMPROVEMENT I DOESN'T TAKE

46
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,369
A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO KNOW
THAT YOU GO TO IOWA IF YOU

47
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,470
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THAT NO
ONE ELSE GOES TO IOWA.

48
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,840
I'M KIDDING, GOOD PEOPLE OF
IOWA, AND GETTING THAT

49
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,269
CITIZEN IOWA IN THE NEXT MONTH
HE WILL RETURN TO THE STATE

50
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:21,659
AND TO PROMOTE HIS BOOK, BERNIE
SANDERS: GUIDE TO POLITICAL

51
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:22,970
REVOLUTION.

52
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,420
THAT IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT
101.

53
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,239
YOU GO TO IOWA, YOU COME UP
WITH A NEW BOOK THAT HE JUST

54
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,761
WROTE A REVOLUTION, HE IS
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT DIET

55
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:34,330
IS SUPER OBVIOUS THAT THEY'RE
NOT TRYING TO HIDE IT.

56
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,930
LARRY COHEN, TOP ADVISOR TO
BERNIE SANDERS FOR A LONG

57
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,880
TIME SAYS I CAN SPEAK FOR THE
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO

58
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,739
SUPPORTED SUPPORTED HIM AND
SAYING WE WOULD LOVE IT IF

59
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,719
HE RUNS AGAIN, AND WHERE HOPEFUL
HE WILL RUN AGAIN.

60
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,860
THAT IS VERY NORMAL, AND THAT
DOESN'T NECESSARILY GIVE

61
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,950
YOU THE MINDSET OF BERNIE
SANDERS, BUT IT CERTAINLY

62
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,629
SAYS IF YOU WERE TO RUN AGAIN,
HIS TOP ADVISERS IN THE MILLIONS

63
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:58,910
OF PEOPLE WHO WERE FOND OF HIM
ARE LIKELY TO SUPPORT HIM.

64
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,390
THAT IS WHY THE DEMOCRATIC
ESTABLISHMENTS IN A PANIC

65
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,010
RIGHT NOW.

66
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,720
ANOTHER BERNIE SANDERS ASSOCIATE
SAYS HE'S KEEPING ALMOST

67
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,439
THE SAME SCHEDULE THAT A
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

68
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,790
WOULD KEEP THAT HE'S DOING MORE
TROUBLE, MORE RALLIES, MORE

69
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,960
FOR THE DNC THAN ANYONE ELSE.

70
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,849
YES, REMEMBER THE OLD EXCUSE FOR
WHY THEY DIDN'T WANT BERNIE

71
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:19,319
SANDERS WAS HE IS AN INDEPENDENT
THAT HE IS NOT EVEN A DEMOCRAT.

72
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,060
WHAT IS HE DONE FOR THEM IT
DEMOCRATIC PARTY?

73
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,980
RIGHT NOW, NO ONE HAS GONE TO
MORE CAMPAIGN EVENTS FOR

74
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,560
OTHER DEMOCRATS THAN TO BERNIE
SANDERS HAS DIE IF YOU DON'T

75
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,290
THINK BERNIE SANDERS HAS DONE
ENOUGH FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,

76
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,530
THEN YOU THINK NO ONE HAS BEEN
THE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

77
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,290
THOUGHT IT WOULD DISQUALIFY
EVERY PERSON IN THE RACE.

78
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,269
THESE ARE ALL NONSENSE EXCUSES
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT HIM

79
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:42,269
RUNNING.

80
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:45,430
SPEAKING OF WHICH, WE GET SOME
MORE OF THE NONSENSE.

81
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,849
THE HILL SAYS, STILL, THE
DECISION BY SANDERS TO RUN

82
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:52,129
FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION IN
2016

83
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:55,749
AS AN INDEPENDENT IS A SORE SPOT
FOR SOME DEMOCRATS.

84
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:57,569
THERE ARE ALSO CLINTON
SUPPORTERS WHO BELIEVE SANDERS

85
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:01,290
DESERVES SOME OF THE BLAME FOR
CLINTON'S LOSS TO TRUMP.

86
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,530
YOU KNOW WHO DESERVES A LITTLE
BIT MORE OF THE BLAME?

87
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,499
THOSE SAME CLINTON SUPPORTERS
WHO RAN HER CAMPAIGN AND

88
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,900
LOST TO DONALD TRUMP.

89
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,909
REMEMBER, BERNIE SANDERS DIDN'T
RUN AGAINST DONALD TRUMP,

90
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:14,909
HILLARY CLINTON DID.

91
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:16,298
YOU KNOW DESERVES THE BLAME?

92
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,399
HILLARY CLINTON.

93
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,529
EVAN BRING IT UP AND RUB IT IN,
SHE IS OFTEN THE WOODS.

94
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,060
I DON'T CARE ABOUT HER ANYMORE,
BUT ALL THESE GUYS PUT OUT

95
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,220
ANONYMOUS HATCHET PIECES IN THE
PRESS, MAYBE BERNIE SANDERS

96
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,060
WAS THE ONE AT FAULT.

97
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,440
YOU RAN THE CAMPAIGN.

98
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,310
YOU ARE THE ONE WHO LOST TO
DONALD TRUMP.

99
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,950
WE TOLD YOU TO STEP ASIDE AND
YOU DIDN'T DIE INSTEAD YOU

100
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,540
SAID, NOBODY HAS TO STEP ASIDE.

101
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,450
HE IS A BETTER CHANCE OF WHEN HE
GETS FROM SO HE NEEDS TO STEP

102
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,810
ASIDE I NEVER MADE ANY SENSE TO
EVERY POLL BERNIE SANDERS

103
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,110
DID BETTER AGAINST DONALD TRUMP
FOR ABOUT 100 POLES IN A ROLE

104
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,130
DIE REPORTED ALSO THEM ON THE
SHOW DURING THE PRIMARIES AND

105
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,770
EVERY PUNDIT WHO LOVED HILLARY
CLINTON, EVERY DEMOCRATIC

106
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,610
ESTABLISHMENT PERSON IS LIKE I
DON'T SEE THE POST ALL OF A

107
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,140
SUDDEN THEY TURNED REPUBLICAN
AND DIDN'T BELIEVE IN POLLS.

108
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,310
YOU NEVER KNOW.

109
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,970
YEAH, BUT I DO KNOW THAT SHE
DOES WORSE THEREBY ENDANGERING

110
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,970
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THE
COUNTRY, BUT THEY DIDN'T LISTEN.

111
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,980
NOW HE IS THE MOST POPULAR GUY.

112
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,350
STILL, NO.

113
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,670
MAYBE IT WAS HIS FAULT.

114
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,870
THERE ALSO DEMOCRATS LOOKING
FOR FRESH FACES, SUCH AS

115
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,190
SENATOR, KAMALA HARRIS, THE
FRESHMAN CALIFORNIA SENATOR

116
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,110
WITH A GROWING NATIONAL
PRESENCE.

117
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,840
I HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT HER MUCH ON
THE SHOW.

118
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,360
I WANT TO BE FAIR TO HER AND DO
MORE RESEARCH BEFORE I COME TO

119
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,770
AN OPINION ON HER BUT LET'S JUST
SAY INTERNALLY HERE FOR A

120
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,580
LONG TIME I HAVE BEEN SAYING
THIS THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT HAS A

121
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,120
CANDIDATE AND IT IS KAMALA HARRIS.

122
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,070
LATER, AND RIGHT NOW I HAVE
NOTHING AGAINST HER.

123
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,070
IÃ­LL DO

124
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,391
SOME RESEARCH AND FIND OUT, BUT
HERE'S WHAT I KNOW, MOST OF

125
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:52,860
THE DEMOCRATIC DONORS ARE LIKE
YES, KAMALA HARRIS.

126
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,260
SHE COULD BEAT BERNIE SANDERS.

127
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,670
I MEAN, SHE COULD BEAT ANYBODY.

128
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,080
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

129
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,270
NOW THEY ARE LOOKING FOR FRESH
FACES.

130
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,551
THAT IS FUNNY, I WAS STILL
JUST A YEAR AGO THAT NO, WE

131
00:06:05,551 --> 00:06:07,370
DON'T GO WITH ANYONE WHO IS NEW.

132
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,180
WE GO WITH TRIED AND TRUE.

133
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,440
YOU GO WITH HILLARY CLINTON
BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN HERE

134
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
FOR DECADES.

135
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,190
YOU GO FOR THE PERSON THAT HAS
BEEN HERE FOR DECADES, THE

136
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,530
CLEAR LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY SO ANYONE WHO IS

137
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,940
CHALLENGING HER TO GET OUT OF
THE RACE.

138
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,960
ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE HAVE A
LEADER IN THE DEMOCRATIC

139
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,920
PARTY AND A LEADER IN THE POLLS
COUNTRYWIDE KEMAL ALL THIS

140
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,170
AND AVOID LOOKING FOR FRESH
FACES.

141
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,330
WHO WANTS TO PRIMARY?

142
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,460
WE'RE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE TO
ENTER THE PRIMARY.

143
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,550
I THOUGHT YOU SAID PRIMARIES
WERE BAD FOR THE DEMOCRATIC

144
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,900
PARTY.

145
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,330
ALL THE SUDDEN, ANYBODY TO BEAT
BERNIE SANDERS.

146
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,570
PLEASE, LET'S PRIMARY THE HELL
OUT OF THIS GUY.

147
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,570
BUT

148
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,880
YOU SAID IT WOULD HURT OUR
CANDIDATE WE PRIMARY PEOPLE.

149
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,640
LOOK AT THEIR RANK HYPOCRISY,
AND ALL OF THESE PAPERS, THEY

150
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,260
DRIVE ME CRAZY, AND ON TV AS
WELL, THEY JUST PRINTED WITHOUT

151
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,210
GIVING IT ANY THOUGHT; HEY, LOOK
AT THIS ANONYMOUS SOURCE

152
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,230
THAT SAID COME ALL HARRIS IS
GREAT AND WE NEED FRESH FACES.

153
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,560
DIDN'T YOU TELL ME A YEAR AGO
THAT WE DON'T NEED FRESH

154
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,450
FACES, AND WE'VE GOT TO GO
WITH ABEL IN THE DEMOCRATIC

155
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,230
PARTY LIKE HILLARY CLINTON WHO
ARE THE ESTABLISHMENT?

156
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,200
WHAT HAPPENED TO FRESH FACES
WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WAS

157
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
RUNNING?

158
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
ARE YOU A GOD DAMN LIAR?

159
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,340
OKAY, YOU ARE A REPORTER AND YOU
DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT?

160
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:26,810
AT LEAST POINT OUT THE
HYPOCRISY.

161
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,780
ANYWAY, AT LEAST ONE STRATEGIST
WHO WAS WILLING TO GO ON THE

162
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,710
RECORD, BRAD BANNON Ã±
NOW, REMEMBER, DEMOCRATIC

163
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,990
CONSULTANTS, THEY GET RICH EVEN
IF DEMOCRATS LOSE.

164
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,190
EITHER WAY, THEY ARE HIRED.

165
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,850
AND, OO, TRUMP WON.

166
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,850
TRUMP WON.

167
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,440
YOU NEED EVEN MORE CONSULTANTS
TO RESIST.

168
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:51,120
BUT IF BERNIE SANDERS WINS, THEY
ARE OUT OF A JOB.

169
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,640
BRAD BRANDON SAYS, "WE FEEL WE
BE BETTER OFF IF WE STARTED

170
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,350
FROM SCRATCH AND RAN SOMEONE
COMPLETE THE NEW, BECAUSE

171
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,670
ARGUMENT FOR THAT.

172
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,530
IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE IF YOU ARE
RUNNING AGAINST SOMEONE

173
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,800
LIKE FRONT, YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO
CAN RUN UNENCUMBERED AND

174
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,900
ISN'T PART OF THE USUAL CROWD."

175
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,730
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

176
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:13,120
THAT'S WHAT WE SET A YEAR
AGO, AND YOU SAID, IT'S

177
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,740
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE HILLARY
CLINTON, WHO IS COMPLETELY

178
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,020
ENCUMBERED, AND IS THE USUAL
CROWD.

179
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,150
YOU TURNED AROUND RIGHT AWAY.

180
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,420
WE NEED SOMEONE UNENCUMBERED.

181
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,120
I JUST FOUND THAT OUT, BECAUSE
MY LIVELIHOOD DEPENDS ON IT.

182
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,870
I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE
CORRUPTION WE'VE GOT GOING

183
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,880
IN WASHINGTON Ã± BERNIE WOULD
END IT Ã± ALL OF A SUDDEN WE

184
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,240
NEED SOMEBODY UNENCUMBERED, AND
NOT PART OF THE USUAL CROWD.

185
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,719
BOY, THAT IS CONVENIENT, ISN'T
IT?

186
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,590
TOTAL AND UTTER NONSENSE.

187
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,130
THEY SEE BERNIE SANDERS COMING
LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN.

188
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,330
A LOT OF US WHO SUPPORTED HIM
SAY, HELL YEAH, WHEN DO WE

189
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,570
GET ON BOARD?

190
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,200
FOR THOSE GUYS, THEY
THINK: OH NO!

191
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,780
ANYTHING BUT BERNIE SANDERS,
BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO AND

192
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,690
OUR CORRUPTION GRAVY TRAIN.

193
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,380
GOD DAMN RIGHT HE IS, AND THAT'S
WHY WE LIKE HIM, THAT'S WHY WE

194
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,450
BACK HIM, AND THAT'S WHY HE IS
THE MOST POPULAR POLITICIAN IN

195
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,610
THE COUNTRY, AND IF YOU ACTUALLY
CARED ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC

196
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,520
PARTY, IF YOU ACTUALLY WANTED TO
RESIST DONALD TRUMP, YOU WOULD

197
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,930
BE PUTTING HATCHETS IN THE BACK
OF THE MOST POPULAR GUY IN THE

198
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,750
COUNTRY, WHO IS ON YOUR SIDE.

199
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,750
YOU WOULD BE HELPING HIM.

200
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,960
BUT YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, YOU DON'T

201
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,680
CARE ABOUT RESISTING DONALD
TRUMP.

202
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,570
YOU NEVER CARED ABOUT BEATING
TRUMP.

203
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,490
THAT'S WHY YOU RAN A CANDIDATE
WHO WE TOLD YOU WAS

204
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,930
ENCUMBERED, AND HAD TERRIBLE
POLLING, BUT YOU RAN WITH

205
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,300
HER ANYWAY, BECAUSE YOU WANTED
TO GET RICH OFF OF IT.

206
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,020
AND NOW THAT BERNIE SANDERS IS
ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING TO

207
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,860
RUN, YOU ARE SCARED TO DEATH
THAT HE IS GOING TO

208
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,810
OVERTURN YOUR APPLECART.

209
00:09:46,810 --> 00:00:00,000
TO WHICH 
I SAY: CAN'T WAIT.
