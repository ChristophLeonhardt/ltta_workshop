<font color="#E5E5E5">RNC last week for coverage and just</font>

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,750
looking at the contrast the number of

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,940
women<font color="#E5E5E5"> who've been on stage at the DNC</font>

27
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,549
versus the RNC we've seen a lot more

28
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,150
women we've heard a lot from women and

29
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,950
you know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more about issues like</font>

30
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,189
pay equity we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear tonight</font>

31
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,799
about universal pre-k and<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,020
are typically I don't like billing them

33
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,110
as women's issues but they do some

34
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,570
people categorize them that way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

35
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,850
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard more of that this week than</font>

36
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have in the last week but I'm excited</font>

37
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">to hear from Hillary tonight for sure</font>

38
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,960
and see what she has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say yeah yeah I</font>

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,030
mean I completely agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was also at</font>

40
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,430
the RNC last week which was a little bit

41
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,530
different um you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I keep thinking</font>

42
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,869
about this great speech at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the RNC by</font>

43
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ivana and how she you know talked about</font>

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,380
what it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to be a working woman</font>

45
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,930
went mom but then you really didn't hear

46
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">that much about like policies that would</font>

47
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,409
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> help working women and working</font>

48
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,240
mothers and so I'm really happy that

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">those issues really got you know center</font>

50
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,409
stage and central billing here at the

51
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,930
DNC<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in a more kind of substantial</font>

52
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,729
way and so I'm really<font color="#CCCCCC"> excited for</font>

53
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,979
Hillary tonight I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've seen a lot</font>

54
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,290
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different kinds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of women and being</font>

55
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,060
you know put on the main stage black

56
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,459
women<font color="#E5E5E5"> latina women today they'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

57
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,470
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> openly trans woman speaking at the</font>

58
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:13,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">gym</font>

59
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,420
you can see which is so exciting yeah

60
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,180
yeah I'm excited yeah I can't wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

61
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,340
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I share similar sentiments I</font>

62
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,990
wasn't I didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the opportunity to</font>

63
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">go to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> RNC but being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has been</font>

64
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,360
definitely a lot more policy heavy I

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,570
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> women as a whole as sort of</font>

66
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,250
not necessarily just an interest group

67
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,370
but as a diverse multicultural

68
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,260
multifaceted group of people who are

69
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,590
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> and need lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font>

70
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">things have been represented both in</font>

71
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,560
policy and in voting blocs and

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,450
everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you look out in</font>

73
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">the crowd you see that at all of these</font>

74
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,830
delegates coming from all over the

75
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,740
United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> are different colors</font>

76
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,300
different faces different genders trans

77
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,730
gender sexual orientation so it's it's

78
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,440
been great to see that represented in

79
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,650
such a sort of stark contrast I think

80
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,230
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's interesting i</font>

81
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,970
like that you right off the bat brought

82
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,380
up that like you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to call them</font>

83
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,150
women's issues and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's funny</font>

84
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,710
because moving forward do you feel like

85
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's going to kind of fall away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

86
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,550
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> health care issues that may be</font>

87
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,800
used to be considered women's issues and

88
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">child care issues that used to be</font>

89
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,620
considered<font color="#CCCCCC"> at women's issues will now</font>

90
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,680
just be considered hey issues yeah I

91
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost feel like that label has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to fall</font>

92
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,130
away just based on where we are at this

93
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,410
time there are so many you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know single</font>

94
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,300
women are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make up a huge number</font>

95
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,280
of voters and could determine this

96
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,280
election and the place where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

97
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,860
right now women<font color="#E5E5E5"> are independent you</font>

98
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,410
don't have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a man co-sign a</font>

99
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,960
credit card<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you to get one oh my god</font>

100
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,840
a different place now there are a

101
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,500
stay-at-home dads there are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

102
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fluidity between the genders now</font>

103
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,420
it's there's no reason to separate them

104
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,220
as men's issues and women's issues

105
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,020
because they are everyone's issues the

106
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,090
economy is an issue for men and it's an

107
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,420
issue for women so I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like one day</font>

108
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,060
that label has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fall away because it's</font>

109
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">just it doesn't make sense anymore yeah</font>

110
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,640
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> call anything mens issues right</font>

111
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,989
I was trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think everyone just now</font>

112
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:26,479
ah although it has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

113
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,610
hot<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I was thinking yeah something</font>

114
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,190
like paternity<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave might be a men's</font>

115
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,370
issue but not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz it's an</font>

116
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,500
everybody issue it's a family it's great

117
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,020
exactly yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

118
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,479
you know where these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are American issues</font>

119
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,039
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the issues that mattered the</font>

120
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,919
most to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> widespread electric of the</font>

121
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,599
American<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and that's what matters</font>

122
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:49,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> women men children</font>

123
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,069
families the broad spectrum of humanity

124
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:54,259
yeah yeah for sure I<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree and I think I</font>

125
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:56,569
mean on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue of these these kind of</font>

126
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:58,039
issues being framed as women's issues I

127
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:01,039
mean everyone is better off<font color="#CCCCCC"> when my you</font>

128
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,990
know the economy is good everyone better

129
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,030
off with like<font color="#E5E5E5"> women and all people have</font>

130
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,219
reproductive freedom and so honestly

131
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:08,629
thinking of them is like women's issues

132
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:10,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't actually accurate when we can you</font>

133
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,830
know safely see that everybody benefits

134
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,659
when these things are addressed yes

135
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:18,830
absolutely absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I and in 2012</font>

136
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,659
women made up more than half of the vote

137
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:24,080
you know in and in 2016 we've got the

138
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,580
first female candidate who's being

139
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,620
nominated by a major party you know so

140
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,789
it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the women vote will affect</font>

141
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,729
this campaign even more than infected

142
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:37,310
the last campaign absolutely and does it

143
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,130
feel that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do do women feel more</font>

144
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,080
front and center<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this campaign I mean</font>

145
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,599
aside from the head<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the party at this</font>

146
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:48,620
point I'd say yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know in many ways I</font>

147
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,020
think that um as a rule right now young

148
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,490
women are starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to feel so much more</font>

149
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,770
comfortable stepping into the electoral

150
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,979
political Fiat spear and I think that

151
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:03,620
because of that impetus you're seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

152
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,789
lot more of it but it doesn't

153
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:06,889
necessarily mean that it wasn't there

154
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:08,750
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just a it's a comfort</font>

155

ability level and it's honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all</font>

156
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:12,529
about having those mentors to look up to

157
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:14,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's about being able to look up on that</font>

158
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,000
stage tonight and know that one day like

159
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,770
I could see myself up<font color="#CCCCCC"> there I could see</font>

160

transgender president will have someone

164
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that so i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think i think it's it's</font>

165
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,940
about having people to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to yeah i</font>

166
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree and i also think i mean in my mind</font>

167
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:35,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think that women</font>

168
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,700
then at the forefront of every political

169
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,080
movement in the United States right

170
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,600
labor racial justice criminal justice

171
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,370
reform reproductive freedom women have

172
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,810
always been there we've always had this

173
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,910
loud voice and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always been I in my</font>

174
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,250
mind us we've really been these<font color="#E5E5E5"> agents</font>

175
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,170
have changed like move things forward I

176
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,270
think now we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of more</font>

177
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,400
kind of respected and sort of in a more

178
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,470
visible way and so women<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've been</font>

179
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,390
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know doing this work since</font>

180
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,800
forever we haven't we've got and it's

181
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,920
been a little thankless and haven't I

182
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,330
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are starting to step back</font>

183
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,670
and see you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> women you know their</font>

184
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,290
their vote matters or voice matters

185
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,450
their their political clout matters and

186
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,190
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having us the forefront of these</font>

187
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,830
movements in very visible ways yeah yeah

188
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,180
I think that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> great point like it</font>

189
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,400
does seem that throughout history<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

190
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,440
know women<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been marginalized in the</font>

191
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,440
in the role of spokesperson right but

192
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,450
they haven't been in term they haven't

193
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> invisible they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just been not the</font>

194
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,660
spokesperson the person that you

195
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,180
remember in the history books that and

196
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,740
they even<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is starting to change you</font>

197
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,660
know I work mainly on a science show is

198
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,550
well for for discovery and for seeker

199
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,560
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a lot about like women in</font>

200
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,000
science and how they've always been

201
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,740
there it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't always get</font>

202
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,900
the the picture on the on the history

203
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,610
book and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

204
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,050
case of Hillary Clinton it's very

205
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,930
interesting because<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's always</font>

206
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">funny to me to hear when people hear her</font>

207
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,510
early the early years because a lot of

208
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,430
people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know Hillary</font>

209
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,230
Clinton's full history I speak

210
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,570
especially younger voters don't know how

211
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,740
long she's been in the political process

212
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,690
but when you look at a relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

213
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,960
she has with Bill Clinton for a long

214
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,120
time it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was about propping him up and</font>

215
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,010
him running for governor running for

216
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,840
president and her being first lady and

217
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,060
still working on major policies like

218
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">health care reform and chip and all of</font>

219
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,160
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> other things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know she did</font>

220
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,570
while she was in the White House but the

221
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,880
focus was always on bill and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

222
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,670
until you know she says the story goes

223
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,450
someone told her what dare to win dare

224
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,840
to compete dare to compete mrs. Clinton

225
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,669
and those remember Senate New York and

226
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,429
she won and she won by a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just</font>

227
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,320
think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really interesting looking at</font>

228
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,760
her life and where she<font color="#E5E5E5"> started what</font>

229
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,380
things were like in the 60s and

230
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,240
that environment and now where we are

231
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,360
now in 2016 she kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of encompasses a</font>

232
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,950
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those movements in a way</font>

233
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,200
definitely she's definitely spanned them

234
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,460
all and she's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around to see them</font>

235
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,100
all right yeah it's incredible<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

236
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,990
amount of history that someone like

237
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,880
Hillary Clinton has witnessed it's

238
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">amazing and the amount of it that has</font>

239
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,500
her fingerprints on it yeah we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

240
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,240
about affordable<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care we talked</font>

241
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,980
about better education standards we

242
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about all this stuff you can see</font>

243
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">her little finger prints all over this</font>

244
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,520
stuff and that to me is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

245
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,660
enchanting thing about her yeah so it's

246
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,060
interesting i was reading up to research

247
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,760
for this and there was a talk about with

248
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">barack obama there was a sense of</font>

249
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">urgency and interest in electing someone</font>

250
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,030
who would be the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> african-american</font>

251
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">president do you feel that that sense of</font>

252
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,850
urgency for elected the first female

253
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,130
president in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same way because i feel</font>

254
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,710
like from my perspective I haven't seen

255
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">it in the same in the same capacity</font>

256
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,280
there's a lot more talk of a fragmented

257
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,320
women's vote and yes more women do

258
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,690
support Barack Obama when when he was

259
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,140
running in 2008 in 2012 but we've talked

260
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,060
a little bit about how younger women

261
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,320
don't support Hillary in the same way

262
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,810
that older women do and it is there that

263
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,540
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of urgency do you feel that it's</font>

264
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,850
an interesting split and you touched on

265
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,490
the the generational divide that you see

266
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,340
were typical in some<font color="#E5E5E5"> instances younger</font>

267
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,470
women were more enthusiastic about

268
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,210
Bernie Sanders we<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent a lot of time in</font>

269
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,550
Iowa during the primary and talked to

270
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">students at Drake University and a lot</font>

271
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them told me that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they have</font>

272
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,360
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> against Hillary Clinton but</font>

273
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,830
Bernie really spoke to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues that</font>

274
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,250
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerned with they you know</font>

275
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,100
brought up the untrustworthy issue that

276
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,660
she's had to deal with through this

277
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,220
entire campaign is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to deal</font>

278
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,200
with in the general as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for them</font>

279
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,260
it elected a woman was important but it

280
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,150
wasn't the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one issue for them it</font>

281
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,770
wasn't the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they were going</font>

282
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">to vote they wanted to make sure that</font>

283
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">they lined up on economic policies that</font>

284
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,420
they lined up when it came to foreign

285
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,820
policy those were<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issues that were</font>

286
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,890
more important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them than simply just</font>

287
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">gender</font>

288
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,870
I think we're seeing a much more a trend

289
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,850
line that's going much towards much more

290
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,829
towards holistic politics right this

291
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,920
idea that you really are seeing a

292
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,180
generation that's a little bit more

293
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,269
politically engaged than one would have

294
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:13,709
expected from<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

295
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:15,449
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually owe a lot of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

296
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:18,209
Obama campaign for that and at a certain

297
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:20,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">point that there's mentality started</font>

298
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,930
changing towards intersectionality and a

299
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,910
more holistic view of feminism<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

300
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,459
is like I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to vote for who I</font>

301
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:32,370
believe is the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> candidate because I</font>

302
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,170
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right to vote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and make</font>

303
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">decisions based on that and I think that</font>

304
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,740
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start seeing more and</font>

305
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,410
more historic victories in in both of

306
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,899
those areas yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would also mean i</font>

307
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,089
agree with you know all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

308
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:48,149
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> would sort of um that wouldn't sort</font>

309
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:49,589
of raised is another kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

310
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,329
fragmenting factor i know that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

311
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:53,579
black women black women are one of the

312
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,980
most loyal<font color="#E5E5E5"> democratic voting blocs in</font>

313
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,199
history and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that because of that</font>

314
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:00,240
it's very easy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> democratic candidates</font>

315
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,709
particularly Hillary Clinton to sort of

316
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:03,720
take for granted that black women will

317
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,519
support you know a Clinton presidency

318
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,890
and perhaps not feel the<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to like</font>

319
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,560
court our vote as aggressively is you

320
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,000
know you might court other votes and so

321
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,130
I think that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of younger black</font>

322
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,079
feminists there is a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> in sitive</font>

323
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,269
is this a candidate who<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

324
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:19,890
of throw my weight around or behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

325
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,959
I think that's one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons i</font>

326
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,060
think that the vote is so fractured that

327
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,410
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of women are sort of looking</font>

328
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,420
skeptically at her you know or candidacy

329
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">i also think it's just important to sort</font>

330
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,140
of recognize what you were saying this

331
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,149
idea that you know folks are thinking

332
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:34,649
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these issues in a much more</font>

333
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:36,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">holistic way that like if you're a</font>

334
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:38,459
feminist perhaps it isn't that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

335
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> personally believe that it is but</font>

336
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,970
correct isn't that you know the woman

337
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,470
candidate who's going to be your best

338
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">friend your best bit and isn't that what</font>

339
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,810
feminism means exactly we all get to

340
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,550
choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> for ourselves</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than it plays into</font>

341
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,100
democracy in a beautiful way so I think

342
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">um for me like you said I mean I think</font>

343
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:57,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">she is the best Canada and she's</font>

344
00:12:57,389 --> 00:12:58,709
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best equipped to handle</font>

345
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:00,540
the job but at the end of the day I

346
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,060
think Millennials up as a whole aren't

347
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,850
seeing gender quite as much as we've

348
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,160
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> in past generations yeah that's</font>

349
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it seems like to me as well it</font>

350
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,180
seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I liked that phrase the</font>

351
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,810
sense of

352
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,290
see cuz when it felt like with Barack

353
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,610
Obama it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we have an</font>

354
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,960
african-american candidate he's right

355
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,450
like amazing let's vote for him right

356
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,220
that's what I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the the</font>

357
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,420
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fuel of the election was and I</font>

358
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,330
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking with some of older women</font>

359
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,460
here at the convention this week you

360
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,529
felt that sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of her definitely we</font>

361
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:36,870
talked to Roz<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wyman who's one of the</font>

362
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">first women to chair a convention ever</font>

363
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:40,980
she chaired the 1984 Democratic

364
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,710
convention and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know she said on her</font>

365
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,540
headstone she wants it to read I was a

366
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,700
good mother and I helped elect Hillary

367
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,900
in 2016 like this is so important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to her</font>

368
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,850
and women like<font color="#E5E5E5"> her Eleanor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> smeal was</font>

369
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,970
also on the floor when a big part of the

370
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,430
feminist movement and you know they feel

371
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,529
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are way overdue in terms of</font>

372
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:03,000
having a woman<font color="#CCCCCC"> president</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the fact</font>

373
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,790
that it's 2016 and we're still having

374
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,830
this conversation about elected a woman

375
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,370
and um you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they feel that urgency</font>

376
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,850
they feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time is now and women</font>

377
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,640
have a responsibility almost to elect

378
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,350
Hillary or you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like you have</font>

379
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,660
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsibility to elect her and it is</font>

380
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,300
like she said in a way the highest

381
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,030
hardest glass ceiling it's the last big

382
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,580
milestone for American women<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in</font>

383
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,070
terms of having those leadership role

384
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,540
models to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look up to women</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are in</font>

385
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,730
boardrooms there you know presidents of

386
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,250
universities their<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEOs there they're</font>

387
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,380
managing families and businesses and

388
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> entrepreneurs and they're all over</font>

389
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,260
the place with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one thing we haven't</font>

390
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,940
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to tackle is the presidency</font>

391
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,610
and I think it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot to my</font>

392
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,110
generation but I think it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

393
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,620
more to the women who who are the old

394
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,270
stalwarts they've been they've been

395
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,580
waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and working tirelessly for this</font>

396
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,700
for a long time yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I I think I</font>

397
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,680
agree and I mean think about like young

398
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,839
children who have only known you know

399
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">barack obama as president and then if</font>

400
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,380
they only knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> hillary clinton's</font>

401
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,240
president so in their mind you know

402
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,220
people of color can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> President</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

403
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,320
their mind women can be present I like

404
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,610
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't the case when we were</font>

405
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,170
growing up right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still remember a</font>

406
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,000
teacher when I was a child saying I

407
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,620
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said like oh I wanted even when</font>

408
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,120
I grow up and she was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like people</font>

409
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,970
can't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> President and we showed her</font>

410
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,040
hey for the kids for you know that will

411
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,390
always be the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think that's so</font>

412
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,790
so beautiful absolutely yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

413
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,260
importance of<font color="#E5E5E5"> role models is is</font>

414
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,270
paramount you have to have people who

415
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,550
look like you talk like you and act like

416
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,590
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and leadership positions and it's</font>

417
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,600
vital for young girls who are in school

418
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to look up and say that's</font>

419
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,910
what I want to do yeah I can do that it

420
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,130
would you say Hillary Clinton is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a role</font>

421
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,320
model for young people like and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

422
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,670
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it what is something that</font>

423
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,820
really speaks to young people about her

424
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,460
since again just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reiterate it does</font>

425
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,230
seem that older voters are more apt to

426
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,200
support her right I'm for me I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

427
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,050
admire her tenacity<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I admire the fact</font>

428
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,850
that when you look when you think about

429
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,400
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who has no quit Hillary Clinton</font>

430
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,890
has no quit she's the type of person who

431
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,990
and she sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for the right reasons</font>

432
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,000
right she's the type of person who's the

433
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">first one in the office</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the last one</font>

434
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">to leave and she's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it because it</font>

435
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,170
matters and it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to her</font>

436
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what we do matters at the end of the</font>

437
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,490
day and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me it's like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font>

438
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,010
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's enchanting the fact that I</font>

439
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,530
can look up and say okay like if Hillary

440
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,470
Clinton can get through to you know 2008

441
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,160
I can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> through today right yeah yeah</font>

442
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,300
so yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I liked I I liked what</font>

443
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,990
President Obama said in his speech that

444
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,940
you know she<font color="#CCCCCC"> did everything I did</font>

445
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,980
backwards and in heels yeah and that was

446
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">very intimidating in a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways for</font>

447
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,630
him and and I think him coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and</font>

448
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,370
saying that now eight years later you

449
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,590
know that's it's it's nice kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lip</font>

450
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,510
service to 2008 and how rough an

451
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,220
election that really was for<font color="#E5E5E5"> both of</font>

452
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,170
them you know they both<font color="#E5E5E5"> come out came</font>

453
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,540
out a little bruised absolutely and

454
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,609
seeing them together on stage last night

455
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:12,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was taking pictures and there's just</font>

456
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,209
there were so many moments where you

457
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:15,319
looked at them you could tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

458
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,880
really do have a genuine appreciation

459
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,579
for each other and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they really do admire</font>

460
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,609

00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:42,710
she walked out I mean that was it was a

469
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,340
pretty electric scene to be part of for

470
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,690
sure yeah um what about uh kind of to

471
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring it back to like we are at the DNC</font>

472
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,039
at the RNC do you guys feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like women</font>

473
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:00,529
were as represented I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> milianna came</font>

474
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:02,299
out and ivanka came out and there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font>

475
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:04,639
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of talk by women talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

476
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:07,940
Donald<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump and you know just how did</font>

477
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,580
it feel to you looking back at that now

478
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,409
having seen this I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked a</font>

479
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:14,539
little bit about how we feel here but I

480
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:16,610
mean yeah in terms of looking at the RNC

481
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,889
do you think that women were were

482
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,019
powerful in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same way that that it</font>

483
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:23,360
seems like you're describing here I mean

484
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,230
looking at UM the rosters when you line

485
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:32,149
them up but at the RNC you did see you

486
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:34,820
know Ivanka on speed on stage that you

487
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,620
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier in that speech that</font>

488
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,190
did focus a lot actually on women and

489
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,190
the Trump campaign recognizes that if

490
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,559
they are going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> compete</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in November</font>

491
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,049
they have to do more to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get women engage</font>

492
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:49,730
and to get women on their side so they

493
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,460
did spend a fair amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time bringing</font>

494
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,620
out you know the general manager of

495
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,450
Trump winery in Virginia who's a woman

496
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,190
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> women who have worked for Donald</font>

497
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,570
Trump<font color="#CCCCCC"> and can kind of speak to his</font>

498
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,399
character<font color="#CCCCCC"> and who he is as a person so</font>

499
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:04,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">you could tell at the RNC that they</font>

500
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,500
recognize this is an issue for us this

501
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,669
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something we're going to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal</font>

502
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:10,159
with and I do think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they took the</font>

503
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:12,649
time to try and find some unique voices

504
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:15,590
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you haven't heard from and there</font>

505
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,120
were some of the regulars you<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw</font>

506
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,149
senator Joni Ernst<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stage senator from</font>

507
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:22,130
Iowa who's a big Trump supporter

508
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,740
speaking on his behalf as a surrogate

509
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,299
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Shelly more capital from</font>

510
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,460
West Virginia on stage so they tried to

511
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring out some big-name hitter big heavy</font>

512
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:35,269
hitters women in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Congress right now who</font>

513
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:38,269
support him as the nominee but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I</font>

514
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:39,980
think they've got a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work to do if</font>

515
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,409
they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do want to try and get women</font>

516
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:46,309
to you know support Trump in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the general</font>

517
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:48,889
election yeah I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think comparing</font>

518
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:51,530
the RNC to the DNC I do think that they

519
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,660
you know really<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to showcase at</font>

520
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,070
different different kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> women who</font>

521
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,900
are the kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of roles which I</font>

522
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,850
appreciate it and I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

523
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,560
speech that his daughter game was really

524
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,000
really great um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I think that I</font>

525
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,620
hate the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> that folks I think it's a</font>

526
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,470
common idea that folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that like Oh</font>

527
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,550
Democrats with a party of women and like

528
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,020
Republican don't care about women and

529
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,520
like they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any women there are</font>

530
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,040
so many smart capable amazing women on

531
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,750
the right and like yeah I'm happy to see

532
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">these women get more of a spotlight</font>

533
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,290
because as you said earlier when you

534
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,820
know you have representation whether

535
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,170
it's on the right or the left or

536
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,820
anywhere in between that's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

537
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,770
every option so I you know I applaud

538
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,120
them for it because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they were</font>

539
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,680
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> an effort to seduce yeah</font>

540
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,030
highlight these women in these voices

541
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,340
and I would say that that should be more

542
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,320
reflected in their policy positions and

543
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,540
they are you know they care so much

544
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,900
about women which they say they do um

545
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,060
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it's good to see this diversity</font>

546
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,890
of voices including gender I'm saying

547
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,370
yeah agree I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you definitely have</font>

548
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,810
sort of the stark contrast in terms of

549
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,880
hard policy supporting women and

550
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,410
supporting women in the sense that they

551
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,330
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> promoting women to leadership roles</font>

552
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,890
you're seeing a lot more involvement in

553
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,800
red states with especially on local

554
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,280
level um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think like I've got a</font>

555
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,440
long way to go before before I think

556
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,820
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going to be able to</font>

557
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,430
compete on a national scale yeah it's

558
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,930
funny because you all you all use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

559
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,600
word like they tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this they put</font>

560
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,790
an effort into this is that is that a

561
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,010
word that you you when we're saying they

562
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,290
tried it it implies that they may not

563
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,150
have succeeded in that you know they

564
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,260
were trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it whether they</font>

565
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,030
succeed it or not I guess is a different

566
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,250
discussion but<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you do you think that</font>

567
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,900
that was the feeling at the end of the

568
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,360
RNC or is it at a feeling in<font color="#E5E5E5"> comparison</font>

569
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,480
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DNC I guess is maybe a tough</font>

570
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,870
question to ask on the fly<font color="#CCCCCC"> but yeah I</font>

571
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,610
don't I don't know if we'll know if it

572
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:48,560
worked or not until November<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah right</font>

573
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">now Trump has according to Gallup a</font>

574
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,910
70-percent disapproval rating yeah so

575
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,310
he's got it he's got a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> long hill to</font>

576
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,410
climb definitely and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think just to</font>

577
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,620
sort of look at my point earlier i think

578
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,930
that like I think that women need better

579
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,700
representation in all levels of politics

580
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,299
and I

581
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:07,039
even though I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> here at the DNC it's</font>

582
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,720
been great I don't want to like spend

583
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,309
too much time<font color="#E5E5E5"> back padding because i</font>

584
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:12,259
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> more women across</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the board is</font>

585
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:14,659
better like yeah women<font color="#CCCCCC"> of color disabled</font>

586
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:16,369
women marginalized voices all of that

587
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,019
needs to improve on both sides and so

588
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:20,179
while we're here saying like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh was this</font>

589
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:21,830
way at the DNC in this way at the RNC

590
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,049
right it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like set back and say</font>

591
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:26,480
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be better yeah more women</font>

592
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">more diversity in all levels yeah these</font>

593
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,840
are just the conventions they're not

594
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,239
actually Congress they're not actual you

595
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:33,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">know departments in government they're</font>

596
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:35,059
not local government this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

597
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:37,009
conventions where we talk about the

598
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:39,080
politics yeah it's go it's great to see

599
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,029
like so many black women on stage here

600
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:43,239
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> like get us in the Senate right yeah</font>

601
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:46,399
exactly yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and I think I think</font>

602
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:48,649
that goes back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea that we need</font>

603
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:50,299
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaders so that other women feel</font>

604
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:52,190
like I can step<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and run and that's</font>

605
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,080
why it's so<font color="#E5E5E5"> vital for there to be a</font>

606
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,399
diversity of colors races voices

607
00:22:57,399 --> 00:23:00,109
everything in both houses of Congress

608
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:02,690
the military presidency all of it i mean

609
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,119
it's it's absolutely vital that people

610
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:07,759
have others to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up to and say that</font>

611
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,440
yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll run for elected office</font>

612
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,629
you know it's a huge decision to make

613
00:23:11,629 --> 00:23:14,029
and it's um you know it what is the

614
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:15,830
statistic that it takes women four times

615
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,019
as many times as men<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be asked to run</font>

616
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:20,509
yeah actually you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

617
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:22,940
definitely it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change and I</font>

618
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,940
think that um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> both parties are</font>

619
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,590
actively<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to push for that but I</font>

620
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,149
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that currently we're seeing a</font>

621
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:31,039
better job on them on the Democrat side

622
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,460
but yeah and I guess kind of to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

623
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,259
round out the conversation you know

624
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:38,480
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about feminism and</font>

625
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,039
how that's part of this conversation as

626
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:42,710
well how women have moved forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

627
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,379
vote in part because they organized and

628
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:47,929
you know feminists got together and said

629
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:50,629
hey let's make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that equality is an</font>

630
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,029
important part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all of these platforms</font>

631
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:55,609
regardless of your political policy

632
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:58,009
implication there but do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think that</font>

633
00:23:58,009 --> 00:23:59,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's because of celebrity and media do</font>

634
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:01,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's grassroots like what</font>

635
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:03,080
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there there's a lot of</font>

636
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,239
companies investing more in kind of

637
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:07,039
their their female voices you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

638
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">got but broadly on Vice we've got lena</font>

639
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:11,720
Dunham's Lenny letter we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> MTV's</font>

640
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,460
braless I mean we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

641
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,190
shows that are women's voices many of

642
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,130
them openly feminist voices which

643
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,560
are out there and is that helping push

644
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,270
the envelope is that are those role

645
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:27,140
models also but outside of politics in

646
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,060
truth<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's certainly helping I</font>

647
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,130
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it takes a village and I</font>

648
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it starts in the classroom it</font>

649
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,810
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts in the classroom I can</font>

650
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,880
remember being<font color="#E5E5E5"> told yes you can do that</font>

651
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,890
or no you can't do that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the classroom</font>

652
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that changes your entire trajectory</font>

653
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,600
but I think having those resources

654
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,600
available being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to go to someone</font>

655
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">like an emily's list or a nanny's Lester</font>

656
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">Carol's list or things like that and be</font>

657
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,060
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say hey I'm thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

658
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,680
running for elected office and access

659
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,030
the tools and help that you need to do

660
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,380
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that and the same goes</font>

661
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,210
for any profession being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

662
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,860
women's surgeons being able to see

663
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,500
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

664
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,300
building a narrative and it's becoming

665
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,030
much more accessible and tangible for

666
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:11,050
women to look and see feminism as

667
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:15,230
something that isn't it's not foreign to

668
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,760
them anymore it's something that is

669
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,970
innate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then born in each of us yeah</font>

670
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,350
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like so much what you said about</font>

671
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,910
this idea that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

672
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,400
politics it's about sort of our sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

673
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,680
like cultural everything like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

674
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,140
art culture movies all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

675
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that for a long time women were not</font>

676
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,550
young women<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not seeing as sort of</font>

677
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,410
a a driving force of anything not

678
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,420
politics like<font color="#E5E5E5"> our vote was not respected</font>

679
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,760
our artistic tastes were not respected

680
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,350
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are starting to take</font>

681
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,020
women more seriously and I think when

682
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,460
you see things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know Lenny</font>

683
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,650
letter broadly the establishment all

684
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,810
these women saying we don't need to sort

685
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,150
of you know necessarily break down the

686
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,130
door and be like please include<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

687
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,870
because for our own media company right

688
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,850
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need I don't need you know</font>

689
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,890
whatever mainstream media did I tell my

690
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,810
story we can tell our own stories and we

691
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,980
can be very successful at it

692
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,630
economically people will love it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

693
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you know I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that for a</font>

694
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,260
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time people did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not respect</font>

695
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,630
women our choices are outlooks I reviews

696
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,220
and they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like our stories</font>

697
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,110
need to be told in an authentic way by

698
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,850
ourselves and so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

699
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,950
really seeing you know folks have pushed

700
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,170
back against that and say no women are

701
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,300
our choices matter or voices matter our

702
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,650
stories matter and we're going to tell

703
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,480
them we're going to be respected and

704
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,120
we're gonna you know kick ass I like it

705
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,600
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely cool um I think see</font>

706
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,220
like the discussion is kind of said

707
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,500
essentially that the women's vote is not

708
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,890
one thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty damn important</font>

709
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,870
right I mean and being able to win over

710
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,840
women isn't necessarily the goal it's

711
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,880
just kind of make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you're</font>

712
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,990
remembering that they're part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

713
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,060
