what started out as a goofy photo-op store turn into a security disaster now a diplomatic disaster and I'd call it a parliamentary disaster - where the Liberals are voting to keep information secret well exactly I mean it goes beyond being a national lampoon boondoggle it's now showing contempt for idiots you know they came up with a story or they tried to first of all say that it was mr. suroz fault that mr. Atwell got the invitation then they can they said it was rogue Indian elements so then they're saying that Daniel gene was allowed to speak to the media but the media is not allowed to tell Canadians what exactly has happened it's like they've told one lie and now are having to tell lie after lie after lie to cover this up and it shows utter disregard for all Canadians all Sikhs in fact it it taints our name which we have been loyal Canadians entrepreneurial Canadians and successful members of Canadian society from long ago and I find it utterly offensive and I hope that the Conservatives continue to push for the truth I have to commend Andrews Shearer for that 21 hour filibuster I hope they keep going until we do the truth we deserve the truth that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews a day and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
