Reporter: Why Rich, specifically? Why'd you invite him?
Tony: He's my bud!
(Laughs)
I'm Rich Feloni,
senior reporter at Business Insider.
Tony Robbins is a, what he likes to call,
"performance coach." He's coached people
like Serena Williams, Marc Benioff at
Salesforce, Paul Tudor Jones who's a
billionaire investor. Over the last few
years, I've had several opportunities to
interview him. His team reached out to me
and said Tony is going to be at his
resort in Fiji. He was going to be
hosting the winners of Shopify's "Build a
Bigger Business" competition and so we
decided that yeah this would be a great
opportunity to see what Tony is actually
like. We headed out from JFK in New York City
to LAX and then from LAX we took
Fiji Airways to the main airport in Fiji.
It's called Nadi.
As we're waiting to
get on this little island hopper, we
noticed that on the runway is Tony's
private jet and it has a big TR logo on it.
I'm going to admit that I was pretty
scared. I haven't really been in a plane
that small before.
This is the only time
I've ever actually checked the life vest under a seat.
As we were going into the Savusavu Airport — 
well, it's called an airport.
There was a tiny little shack
that was the airport, but it was
basically a cow pasture.
From there, 
off to Namale.
Namale is Tony Robbins' resort.
This was one of his first major
investments, so he was able to get it
kind of cheap and then over the last 30
years, he's just really built it up into
a beautiful resort that's basically
in the middle of the jungle
by a bunch of coral reef.
One of our first stops was
Tony's house.
Tony: Well, nice to see you on the other side of the world. (Laughs)
How are ya?
Rich: Nice to see you, Tony.
Tony: Great. Good to see you too.
Come on in.
He basically has this
decked out hut in like the secluded part
of his resort.
Tony: You ready for my morning routine?
Rich: Yes, perfect
So Tony has this really
elaborate morning routine. I thought he
was going to kind of give us a demo or
something, but he said, 'Why would I give
you a demo when I could just guide you
through the whole thing yourself?'
So we started off with priming, which is kind
of like his take on meditation and yoga.
Tony: Begin to think of a moment in your life
you could feel really grateful for if
you wanted to. Enjoy it. Feel it. 
Fill up with it.
Yeah I'll admit it was pretty weird
but I just gave in totally and was like
you know what, we came all the way to
Fiji, I'm just gonna go all in.
So after his priming exercise, Tony took
us inside and I was surprised to see his
personal trainer Billy, this incredibly
energetic guy who's always laughing.
He made this little cocktail that was
called like an adrenal cocktail or
something. I didn't really know what it
was, but I just decided to drink it.
Tony: How was that?
Rich: Tastes pretty good (Laughs)
And that fueled me for the rest of the
day and everything that was to come.
So next, it's time to check out what Billy
and Tony called the "electric taco."
Billy: We're gonna work as a team. You tell me when
you feel it — even if it doesn't hurt —
just tell me when you first feel it, and we'll
gradually go up.
Rich: So right now, it feels like I'm getting
punched in the chest on both sides.
Tony was saying that this is something that
he does essentially every morning and it
basically stimulates your muscles to the
point where it feels like you're getting
a deep tissue massage. I immediately felt
all of the tightness in my back first
get really, really intense and then
loosen up.
After the electric taco, we went to
Tony's personal gym. It was
filled with these weird contraptions
that looked kind of like something out
of "Saw" or a medieval torture chamber.
Tony: If you want, we'll put you on the little
torture machine.
Full tilt. All the way.
Push as hard as you can.
The most
medieval looking of all of these things
is called the four-minute machine.
Tony: Push! Push! Push! Push! Push!
Around two minutes in, I really didn't
think that I could do it.
Tony: Whatever you got! This is it!
Tony was screaming at me 
and I just felt like
I couldn't embarrass myself there. So just
driven by ego, I had to finish it.
Billy: Push!
Yes!
Tony: Isn't that wild?
It felt as if I had spent like an hour in the
gym.
Tony took us to the next thing that
he does every morning, which is
spend some time in the sauna 
and then a cold plunge.
To be honest, it felt great. Basically,
it's part of the workout because your
heart rate is accelerated the whole time.
Tony: You'll find your body really relaxing
because you've taken it to such extremes.
You'll drop down to a different level.
Like if you went and meditated now, 
you're gonna meditate deep.
So the week went by.
We got some great opportunities to see Tony in
action and coaching entrepreneurs.
We realized that we needed some extra
footage that we didn't get to kind of
just wrap everything up 
before we headed back home.
Tony: How you guys doing?
We were really only expecting 5 or 10 minutes.
He starts giving us a
tour and after just a few minutes, he
points out something and says
Tony: Did you go up
to the waterfall?
Rich: Have we gone to the waterfall?
Reporter: No we didn't make it to the waterfall.
Tony: OK we should run you up to the
waterfall. Will you call them and ask
them if they've got — 
my car's broken down, I think
I don't know if I can fit in this car.
So a five-minute trip for extra footage
ended up being an adventure that 
lasted over an hour.
Tony: I love this.
At the top of this mountain
was a waterfall.
I really wasn't expecting him to just
dive into the water
throw his shirt off
and then scream like Tarzan.
(Tony yells)
I dove into the water after Tony.
It's a pretty surreal experience.
What I got from this
last adventure was that Tony is a guy
who if you give him five minutes and
you're able to get in front of him
if he's able to 
make a connection with someone
he's really going to engage fully.
In Fiji, you could tell that he's
like completely relaxed. This is his home turf.
And I could see that he still kind
of had like a
kids approach to the whole thing.
Tony: Are we on time? Am I late?
They had to catch a flight to Australia.
A group of people who worked at Namale
had formed a semicircle
to sing a traditional Fiji farewell song.
Tony: Time to say goodbye again. 
I'm so sorry
but I look forward to coming back home 
to see all the family again.
It's been a beautiful, beautiful trip. Bula vinaka.
(Singing)
When you're in Tony's presence, you kind
of get sucked into this —
He's got a very magnetic personality.
Totally, he's not for everyone.
There are plenty of people who 
wouldn't be into this stuff.
Whether it's through his work 
or his philanthropy
I'm convinced that Tony is
someone who is a genuine guy.
Yes, he's able to make a ton of money because he
has very clearly defined business goals
but everything that he's preaching
and teaching people, he genuinely
believes himself. So after this trip, I've
become convinced that anything in his
material that he's teaching, this is
something that he fully believes.
He's fully invested in.
And I think that
makes a big difference
whether you're in or whether you're out.
