00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:58,581
LOST YOUR JOB AT FEDEX AND YOU

55
00:01:58,581 --> 00:02:04,554
TURNED TO CRIME.

56
00:02:04,554 --> 00:02:05,621

CHANGE YOUR LIFE BASED ON A

00:02:20,536 --> 00:02:23,139
TEMPORARY SITUATION.

65
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:24,774
JUST BECAUSE YOU GO INTO PANIC,

66
00:02:24,774 --> 00:02:26,008
TAKE YOUR BREATH AND WAIT IT

67
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:26,275
