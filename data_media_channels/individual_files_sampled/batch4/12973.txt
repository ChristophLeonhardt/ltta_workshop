you the Vatican Secretary of State Secretary I don't know why I said it like that but I did let's just go with it the Secretary of State said today that Frances Pope Francis is serene right now he's feeling serene despite the allegations against him and that is that that's nice isn't it is that nice to hear he's serene the entire Catholic world has descended in the moral chaos but the Pope is serene great so wonderful to hear and of course the Secretary of State did not answer any questions about the substance of the allegations he didn't have anything to say about that it has been now four days since the Pope was credibly accused of personally covering up sex abuse and this has been the Pope's response nothing not a word but he is serene so so that's good now the Vatican has issued no statement about these allegations it did issue a statement though yesterday about something and I remember I saw you know I finally saw the headline and I had before I read the entire headline but it's a Vatican issues statement and then I said finally but then I saw that know that the statement was to clarify comments that Pope Francis had made which had offended gay people they people were concerned that Francis had said something that sounded like he was implying the homosexuality is a mental disorder so the Vatican quickly clarified that I mean they came out and they said no they issued that clarification right away because that's very important this is the Vatican's priority you say it cares about soothing the hurt feelings of gay people but as for the spiritual chaos and despair of devout Catholics everywhere it has no evident concern now has anybody offered a plausible defense of the Pope well the the the liberal Cardinal cupich who is a disgrace of a man and an embarrassment to Christians everywhere he said that Pope Francis Pope Francis you know doesn't have time to worry about this because he's too busy protecting the environment and caring for immigrants and so he's too busy with all that to bother with these allegations that's actually what he said and he also said that he thinks the criticism of Pope Francis is really rooted in bigotry against against Latinos now I don't even think that such a thing is we should dignify such a such a comment with a response but I will respond to it anyway to say number one that is idiotic you disgrace of a man number two Pope Francis is he's a he's a in Italian is ethnically Italian born to Italian parents in Argentina so I think the racism charge considering he's a white Italian man is you know that's it that that's that's a hard what it's gonna be hard to make that land okay now the leftist media they claim that there's a coup going on against the innocent Pope Francis being waged by terrible conservatives and then you have people in the church who have been attempting to deflect from all this by slandering Archbishop vigan Oh who's the man who made these allegations accusing him of his own sex abuse cover-up now he's come out against those accusations and and offered documentation to prove that they're false so vegan Oh has you know he came out with the original allegations and he has and he was accused of something he came out with documentation proving that it's false so he's very open and he's responding and he's engaging as opposed to pretty much every person who was indicted by his allegations they've all just clammed up and had nothing or very little to say besides which as I as I've already said it doesn't really matter even if vegan Oh were guilty of a sex abuse cover-up which he doesn't seem that he is but even if he had done that it doesn't matter what he's guilty of he could be guilty of the JFK assassination doesn't matter it has no relevance to the fundamental question the fundamental question is is it was it true is it true the allegations that he made are they true that's all that matters and the weakest defense of all of course offered for Pope Francis is the one offered by Pope Francis it's weak because it's non-existent he offers no defense he gives us no explanation he just waves us off dismissively and says basically run along I don't care which is by the way what he's been doing to faithful Catholics for six years can we imagine that an innocent man would behave this way it's hard to imagine it's hard to imagine it's hard to imagine that an innocent man would face these allegations and have nothing to say whatsoever but Pope Francis has cover while he hides and it is as I said cover from the liberal media I am fully accustomed to seeing the leftist media lie mislead slander spin false narratives I am not at all accustomed to seeing them lie mislead slander and spin false narratives for the sake of the Vatican okay that is these are very strange times that is as as I said I will never get used to that if you had told me ten years ago that I would be that I would be going after the Pope while the media protects him I would have been highly skeptical then again if you had told me that Donald Trump would be President and Dennis Rodman would be our ambassador at North Korea I also would have been skeptical about that as well said but these are the times we're living in of course the primary lie that we're hearing from the media with regard to all of this is that is that this is an ideological battle that's what they're telling us this is a battle of the conservatives versus the enlightened progressives there was a headline on Reuters yesterday that said defenders rally around Pope fear conservatives escalating war yes conservatives are the ones escalating things it's our fault it's our fault it's not the fault of the homosexual networks in the church who have been covering up sex abuse for decades no no it's not their fault it's the fault of conservatives you see now what I want to do is I want to address the idea that this is all ideological an ideological war because that's where you're hearing everywhere and if you get if you're getting your news about this from the leftist media that's probably the impression you have it's a false impression for three reasons number one there's nothing ideological about being opposed to sex abuse unless we're saying that opposition to sex abuse is a uniquely conservative position number two the ideology of Francis's critics is irrelevant because no matter their ideological convictions the question they are asking is valid and non idea ideological did Francis do it is he guilty that's the question it is not an ideological question and the ideology of the people asking it is irrelevant on the other hand Francis's ideology and the ideology of the cover-up artists in the Vatican that is relevant because it could be argued that their liberal non-judgmental tolerant open-minded perspective is what led them to support and promote and protect active homosexuals in the first place and as the as the floodgates are being opened here and more stories are coming out we're seeing we're seeing this kind of be fleshed out light LifeSite news has a has two or three articles about new allegations from other people in the Vatican about Pope Francis and they all revolve around this there they all revolve around his tolerance for active homosexuals around him like there's one where he he gave a Vatican apartment to a priest who was a known active homosexual and who had been accused of sex abuse gave him an apartment knowing this about him and this is coming from someone in the Vatican told this to the to LifeSite news knowing this about gave an apartment and the next thing you know there is there's a gay drug fueled orgy going on in a Vatican apartment you know with with this active homosexual who Pope Francis had given Department so there's there's that kind of thing and it would seem that his liberal ideology is not irrelevant to this to this fact number three and this is the most important thing when it comes to the essential moral teachings of Christianity there is no conservative or liberal distinction there aren't different versions or varieties okay now conservative versus liberal that might make sense if we're talking about in Catholicism something like the liturgy you know how the mass is celebrated and so on conservatives will tend to favor more traditional more reverent approaches and their view is absolutely right because the liberalization and secularization of worship is an abomination before God but here maybe you do find a conservative liberal dynamic where obviously as always liberals are wrong as they are wrong about basically everything but when it comes to the moral truths when it comes to something like the homosexual act for instance which is what a lot of this revolves around and where the suppose an ideological war hinges in the church but here there is only one correct Christian position those who say the act is immoral are not conservative they're just Christian those who say that it is not immoral are they're not liberal they are actually rejecting the authority of Scripture rejecting natural law and if they're Catholic they're rejecting the teachings of the church that is not a liberal position that is just an unchristian position that is a position that as a Christian is not available to you so when it comes to these moral truths there are there aren't different ways of looking at it there is only one way of looking at it there is only one truth there is only one thing you're allowed to believe if you want to continue being a Christian now I am NOT at the moment interested in in discussing whether Christianity is right about homosexuality or about any other moral point that's beside the present point the present point is simply that Christianity does have a teaching on these subjects that's the point and if you wish to and if you're not Christian and you don't you don't agree with the teachings well fine whatever you don't have to agree with ten but if you claim to be Christian you have to agree with the teachings you can't disagree with them the Bible clearly condemns the homosexual act repeatedly including in first Corinthians Romans first Timothy all across the Old Testament most notably in Leviticus and Genesis moreover Jesus Christ himself defines marriage in both Matthew and Mark he teaches that marriage is when a quote man and his quote wife come together and quote become one flesh he defines marriage he says this is what marriage is he offers a definition that's the son of God so what we are left with is a full uncompromising explicit consensus across both the old and new Testament about the nature of marriage and the moral depravity of the homosexual Act every church for almost 2,000 years affirmed these teachings no Christian theologian or thinker of any note or any legitimacy found or claimed to find any pro gay interpretation of any of the verses mentioned above that is because no such interpretation can be found it isn't there it doesn't exist we must either accept with humility the biblical view on this topic or we must throw the Bible out and Christianity along with it and if we're going to do that then we are not Christian if we try to retain our progressive views then we must be doing so on one of the following three foundations okay so if you want to say well no you know homosexual the homosexual act is fine or you know or if you want to have a in general a more liberalized idea of sexual morality sex outside of marriage is fine and so forth well if you're going to do that then you have to be doing it on one of the three following three foundations number one the Bible is wrong number two this behavior was wrong during biblical times but it is no longer wrong number three the Bible actually supports this behavior but it's support is so subtle and hidden that nobody noticed it for twenty centuries until we came along and discovered it now as a Christian the first foundation the Bible is wrong that doesn't work because it denies the moral authority of Scripture and if scripture contains moral error and so much of it - then we have no reason to believe anything else that tells us and if we cannot believe what it tells us then we have no reason to believe that our faith is true so that doesn't work for a Christian that doesn't for a Christian the second foundation that this behavior was wrong very biblical times but it's not wrong anymore that doesn't work because it it trades objective morality for moral relativism but moral relativism is incompatible with Christianity because on the Christian understanding morality is grounded in and flows from an eternal perfect all-knowing and changeless God if morality is relative that God is either imperfect and changeable or non-existent number three the third foundation that doesn't work either that the Bible actually does support this behavior but we didn't know it until now that doesn't work either leaving aside to the arrogance of that kind of view where you're saying that every but every Christian in history was wrong about this except for you let's leave aside the arrogance of that the problem is that it supposes that the Bible is so confusing and so incomprehensible that even its clearest commands and its clearest edicts cannot be known this view suggests that the Bible may mean the opposite of what it says and it may take a couple of millennia for us to realize it so what opposite meanings will we discover in the year 4000 perhaps by then it'll turn out that the Bible's references to Jesus as the Son of God actually meant that he's not the son of God I mean anything is possible and if anything is possible then Christianity ceases to be meaningful or intelligible and if it's not meaningful or intelligible than it is literally unbelievable it is not something that a person can believe because it doesn't mean anything so none of this works as a Christian as I said if you're not a Christian then what whatever you could take any of those positions that you want doesn't matter you're not Christian right but if you are a Christian you can't you can't take any of those position of any of those positions undermines everything else you believe it undermines the faith that you pretend to profess so we are left with only two valid options be Christian and accept its moral teachings or don't be Christian those are the only that's it you can't say well but what if I think that Christianity is wrong about this that the other thing but I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God well but you don't really believe that do you because if you're saying that the Bible is wrong about marriage well Jesus defined America if you're telling me that he's wrong about it then you can't possibly believe that he's divine because then he can't be wrong so you've just removed by bite by claiming that he spoke falsehood he spoke out of ignorance he spoke out of whatever bigotry you are removing his divinity so no you don't believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God you say you do but you don't now on the other hand you might say well I believe he's a son of God no I don't believe that he said anything wrong but but he didn't really say those things that was made up he didn't really say they they put that into his mouth and you didn't really say well okay but then how do you know so that's that part never happened well how do you know any of it happen then how do you know the Incarnation happened how do you know the crucifixion happen I mean you're getting all of it from the same document aren't you you can't do that you you can't go through the Bible and start saying well that didn't happen that then he didn't really say that now I didn't say that that's that's false that's completely wrong no that moral teaching is incorrect but yeah that Matt that's true on what basis are you doing that on what authority were you getting this from one more thing I think this is a really important point when we talk about accepting the moral teachings you know what I say to be Christian we have to accept the moral teachings that is not the same thing as say I am NOT saying that in order to be in order to be Christian we have to follow the moral teachings perfectly or we cease to be Christian that's not what I'm saying now we do have to try to follow the teachings but that's not the point obviously nobody follows the moral law perfectly least of all myself you can be weak imperfect sinful cowardly and still be Christian that's Christianity is made for Jesus says I came to call I didn't come to call the righteous I came to call sinners so that's and that's all of it and thank God for that because if only the strongest and most courageous and most qualified could be Christian then I would be disqualified personally but here's what we can't do we can't categorically reject the moral law and say that it doesn't apply to us we can't do that we can't say that we worship God and then in the next breath say that his Commandments are irrelevant that doesn't work so that you know I just think this is a distinction that for some reason people struggle with so much is there any time you get into this conversation people say oh you're woods you're saying we have to be perfect no I'm not saying we have to be perfect but I mean we should we strive to be perfect we strive for holiness but no it's it's it we're not saying that we have to be perfect right now you take any moral rule you know we're not saying you have to follow it perfectly in order to be Christian but you have to accept it you have to accept its legitimacy you you can't say it's not legitimate just because you disagree with it or it's or it's inconvenient where it's hard you can't do that as a Christian you can't do that for all the reasons I've just outlined because you're tearing down the legitimacy of Christianity which it's up you can try to do that from the outside you can't come into the inside and do that you can't come into Christianity and then try to tear down its legitimacy while claiming to be Christian and this is also why people say well why are you so you know it comes to homosexuality what why are you so why are why are conservative Christians so obsessed with this issue why are they talking about it all the time well number one we're not the ones taught we're not the ones who are always bringing it up it I would much prefer to live in a society where we didn't need to talk about this at all where it never came up but I'm not the one bringing it up there is a there is a a loud voice out there including a voice within Christianity or people who claim to be Christian who every day are saying no this is OK we have to accept it so they're the ones bringing it up literally marching through the street those of us who are conservative Christian when we resist that and we oppose them what we're doing is we're defending the legitimacy of our religion because that's what's being called into question it's not specific it's not about homosexuality exclusively specific it is about that as well obviously but that's not that's not just it it's this conversation isn't happening in a vacuum the reason why we feel so necessary to rebuke Christians who hold this view is because they are undermining that they are calling into question our religion itself and so that's why that needs to be met met and every every age you know every era of Christianity there have been heresies there have been certain aspects of Christianity that have come under attack and so those who who love the faith and believe in it it's necessary for them to rally around that truth and defend it and become obsessed with it when they're not obsessed with it it's just that it is there's a certain pillar of the faith that sucked that there's a movement trying to rip it down and so we've to rally around that pillar and say no and in our time the heresy revolves all around morality and especially sexual morality the the heresy basically is moral relativism and it's a heresy what its within Christianity when you have Christians who say that morality changes or that we get to decide what's more and so those of us who love the faith we have to rally around objective morality and say no you cannot tear down this pillar all right we'll leave it there thanks for listening everybody Godspeed you
