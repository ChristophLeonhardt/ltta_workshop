1
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:09,776
I THINK THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS

2
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,044
DOING PRETTY WELL IT SEEMS TO ME

3
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,413
OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS.

4
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,015
A LOT IS GOING TO DEPEND ON WHAT

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:24,257
COMES BACK FROM THE FBI.

6
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,025
I THINK JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS DOING

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:30,998
VERY WELL RIGHT NOW.

8
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:32,064
WE SPOKE AND THAT'S MOVING ALONG

9
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:33,967
NICELY BUT I DON'T WANT TO

10
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:34,701
INTERRUPT WITH GOING ON WITH

11
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,268
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

12
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,337
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING TO

13
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:38,071
INTERRUPT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

14
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,707
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

15
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,978
AND I THINK THE PROCESS, I MUST

16
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:45,712
SAY HOPEFULLY THEY WILL HAVE A

17
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,482
VOTE BY THE END OF THE WEEK AND

18
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,083
IT WILL BE A POSITIVE VOTE.

19
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,618
BUT IT WILL BE DEPENDENT ON WHAT

20
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,121
COMES BACK FROM THE FBI.

21
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:57,558
THE FBI IS WORKING, WORKING VERY

22
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:10,137
HARD AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

23
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,639
I THINK HE WAS FIGHTING PEOPLE

24
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:13,307
THAT WERE MAKING VERY TOUGH

25
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,642
CHARGES AGAINST HIM, AND I

26
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,245
THOUGHT HE DID VERY WELL.

27
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:18,979
I REALLY DID.

28
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,615
HE IS FIGHTING VERY HARD FOR HIS

29
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:26,854
REPUTATION, FOR HIS FAMILY.

30
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:28,455
IT WAS TOUGH STUFF.

31
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:29,356
I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE STUFF FOR

32
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:29,790
A LONG TIME.

33
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,694
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE

34
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,262
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH RESPECT TO

35
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,263
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

36
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:36,997
IT IS A HIGH-QUALITY PERSON,

37
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:38,933
THIS IS A NUMBER ONE STUDENT,

38
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,669
TOP INTELLECT.

39
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:42,603
HE'S NEVER GONE THROUGH ANYTHING

40
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:43,003
LIKE THIS.

41
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:49,443
I THINK YOU DID VERY WELL.

42
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,111
I THINK IT'LL BE TOTALLY

43
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,580
IMPARTIAL, HE'S A GREAT JUDGE,

44
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,115
HE IS KNOWN AS A GREAT JUDGE.

45
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,717
IF THERE IS ONE DISAPPOINTMENT,

46
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,586
I DON'T THINK THAT YOU PEOPLE

47
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:01,288
COVERED IN ASPECT THAT'S VERY

48
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,523
IMPORTANT, AND THAT IS WHAT HE'S

49
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,658
DONE OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS.

50
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,494
IF YOU GO BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL

51
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:07,361
AND GOING BACK TO COLLEGE, WHAT

52
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:10,264
HAS HE DONE OVER THE LAST 30

53
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:10,830
YEARS?

54
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,366
HE HAS BEEN SPECTACULAR.

55
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:18,272
HE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS SUCCES

56
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:22,110
SUCCESS.

57
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,810
I HEARD LINDSAY SAY THAT AND

58
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,846
IT'S CERTAINLY INTERESTING.

59
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:27,181
I WAS IN TENNESSEE LAST NIGHT

60
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:30,451
AND I WANT TO SAY THAT THOSE

61
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:31,319
PEOPLE, WE HAD A SOLD-OUT ARENA

62
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,555
WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

63
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:35,723
OUTSIDE, EVERYWHERE I GO I'M

64
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:38,126
GOING TO PENNSYLVANIA, THE SAME

65
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:39,193
THING.

66
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,663
THEY ARE SO IN FAVOR OF JUDGE

67
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:42,397
KAVANAUGH, NEVER SEEN ANYTHING

68
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:42,864
LIKE IT.

69
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:44,198
I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S LIKE A

70
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,867
RALLYING CRY FOR THE

71
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:46,668
REPUBLICANS.

72
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,803
THEY ARE SO IN FAVOR OF JUDGE

73
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:53,408
KAVANAUGH.

74
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:55,376
MELANIA IS IN AFRICA.

75
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:58,146
I JUST SAW ON TELEVISION OR

76
00:02:58,146 --> 00:02:58,780
WALKING OUT OF THE PLANE.

77
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,482
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND SAYING

78
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:02,183
HELLO TO THE KIDS.

79
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,284
SHE IS REALLY DOING A GREAT JOB

80
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:10,091
AS FIRST LADY.

81
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:11,559
I WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH

82
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,494
THE FBI.

83
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:14,462
THEY'RE COMING BACK WITH

84
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:14,796
REPORTS.

85
00:03:14,796 --> 00:03:17,265
THEY'LL BE BACK VERY SOON.

86
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:19,901
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A SECOND

87
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,069
TIME?

88
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:22,704
THIS WAS LINDSAY'S IDEA, LINDSEY

89
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:27,742
IS A FRIEND OF MINE AT LEAST FOR

90
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,344
THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND HE HAS

91
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:30,278
DONE A GREAT THING AND A GREAT

92
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:32,914
SERVICE FOR OUR COUNTRY.

93
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:37,752
BUT I HAVE TO SAY I REALLY THINK

94
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:40,321
THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS GOING TO

95
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,322
BE ACCEPTED AND VOTED ON AND

96
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:43,491
POSITIVELY VOTED ON BUT WE ARE

97
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:44,926
GOING TO HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE

98
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:45,794
FBI SAYS.

99
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:57,972
THEY'LL COME BACK WITH A REPORT.

100
00:03:57,972 --> 00:03:58,640
IT'S A TOUGH THING GOING ON.

101
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,243
IF YOU CAN BE AN EXEMPLARY

102
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,411
PERSON FOR 35 YEARS AND THEN

103
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:04,879
SOMEBODY COMES IN THEY SAY YOU

104
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,918
DID THIS OR THAT AND THEY GIVE

105
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:13,254
THREE WITNESSES AT THIS POINT

106
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:16,658
WHO DO NOT CORROBORATE WHAT YOU

107
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:19,461
ARE SAYING, IT'S A VERY SCARY

108
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:20,161
SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE GUILTY

109
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:21,730
UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT.

110
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,700
MY WHOLE LIFE, I'VE HEARD YOU'RE

111
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,869
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.

112
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:28,537
BUT NOW YOU'RE GUILTY UNTIL

113
00:04:28,537 --> 00:04:30,872
PROVEN INNOCENT.

114
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:32,974
THAT IS A VERY, VERY DIFFICULT

115
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:38,714
STANDARD.

116
00:04:38,714 --> 00:04:40,849
I SAY THAT IT'S A VERY SCARY

117
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:41,550
TIME FOR YOUNG MEN IN AMERICA

118
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,087
WHEN YOU CAN BE GUILTY OF

119
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:47,189
SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY NOT BE

120
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:49,324
GUILTY OF.

121
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:51,960
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME.

122
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,263
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS MUCH

123
00:04:55,263 --> 00:04:56,531
MORE TO DO THAN EVEN THE

124
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:58,133
APPOINTMENT OF A SUPREME COURT

125
00:04:58,133 --> 00:04:58,467
JUSTICE.

126
00:04:58,467 --> 00:04:59,868
IF IT REALLY DOES.

127
00:04:59,868 --> 00:05:02,137
YOU CAN BE SOMEBODY THAT WAS

128
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:04,439
PERFECT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND

129
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:07,576
SOMEBODY COULD ACCUSE YOU OF

130
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:08,343
SOMETHING.

131
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:12,948
DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE A

132
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:16,018
WOMAN, BUT SOMEBODY COULD ACCUSE

133
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:17,286
YOU OF SOMETHING AND YOU ARE

134
00:05:17,286 --> 00:05:17,919
GUILTY.

135
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,421
YOU ARE GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN

136
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:19,788
INNOCENT.

137
00:05:19,788 --> 00:05:21,623
THAT IS ONE OF THE VERY, VERY

138
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:22,357
BAD THINGS THAT'S TAKING PLACE

139
00:05:22,357 --> 00:05:31,333
RIGHT NOW.

140
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,534
THERE'S NOT A MESSAGE NOW BUT

141
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:34,303
YOU MIGHT HAVE A MESSAGE BY THE

142
00:05:34,303 --> 00:05:34,770
END OF THE WEEK.

143
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,906
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE.

144
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:39,041
HE IS AN OUTSTANDING PERSON,

145
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,477
HE'S AN OUTSTANDING MAN AND FOR

146
00:05:41,477 --> 00:05:44,012
HIS SAKE AND FOR THE SAKE OF HIS

147
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:47,116
FAMILY, I HOPE HE DOES WELL.

148
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:49,785
I THINK HE'S BEEN VERY BRUTALLY

149
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:53,388
TREATED.

150
00:05:53,388 --> 00:06:00,296
I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO PEOPLE.

151
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:01,730
WE ARE GOING TO TALK LATER.

152
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,099
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING TO

153
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:05,301
INTERRUPT WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS

154
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:05,701
PROCESS.

155
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:07,269
THAT'S FINE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO

156
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,505
DO ANYTHING TO INTERRUPT THE

157
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:18,747
PROCESS.

158
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:20,349
I DON'T DRINK, I'VE NEVER HAD A

159
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:20,716
DRINK.

160
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:22,585
I DON'T DRINK BEER, I'VE NEVER

161
00:06:22,585 --> 00:06:23,285
HAD A BEER.

162
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:24,987
I'M NOT SAYING GOOD OR BAD, SOME

163
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:25,588
PEOPLE LIKE IT.

164
00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:27,089
I JUST CHOSE NOT TO DO THAT FOR

165
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:31,694
A LOT OF REASONS.

166
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:33,963
I THINK I REMEMBER MY COLLEGE

167
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:36,332
DAYS, EVERYBODY WAS DRINKING.

168
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:36,932
IT WAS NORMAL.

169
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:38,701
I WAS ABNORMAL.

170
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:40,302
IT WAS TOTALLY NORMAL, EVERYBODY

171
00:06:40,302 --> 00:06:41,036
WAS DRINKING AND I USED TO DRINK

172
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:43,506
A LOT OF BEER.

173
00:06:43,506 --> 00:06:44,440
AND THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG, I

174
00:06:44,440 --> 00:00:00,000
JUST DIDN'T CHOOSE TO DO THAT.
