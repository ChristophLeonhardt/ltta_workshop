Sean Hannity recently engaged in a kerfuffle with a one of his sponsors one of the advertisers on his show because the advertiser pulled out following some of Hannity support for Roy Moore the Senate candidate in Alabama who has now been alleged by several women of sexual assault when he was in his 30s and when some of them were minors now Hannity has supported Roy Moore and then later kind of apologized for some of the things that he said but before doing so Keurig decided to pull its advertisements from Hannity show and then that resulted to a number of you know hannity supporters breaking their Keurigs in protest it was a Keurig boycott right okay so here's the update to the story Keurig has now released a statement and they have kind of apologized but not really so it gets that just a second but Hannity recently called on his fans to stop destroying their curat coffee machines after the company's CEO apologized for a tweet publicizing the company's decision to pull ads from Hannity's program I want to clarify what this so-called apology is now to be clear Keurig has still pulled its ads from Hannity show they're just apologetic about the fact that they publicized it on Twitter and I'm guessing that they're apologetic because it riled Sean Hannity's fans up more than anything look I get the sponsors or sometimes in a tough spot because they damned if you do damned if you don't that's their perception because I mean if you don't pull as from Sean Hannity when he appears to be defending a child molester and Roy Moore if you read the details of what he did to a 14 year old girl and the 16 year old girl it is all rific well I mean then you're gonna catch heat from people saying why are you giving money to a guy defending a child molester then they they pull the ads and they happen to tweet it publicly like oh we're pulling the ads right there's a statement saying we're pulling ads and then consumers lose their mind we love child Lester's why are you doing that don't do that okay now to be fair they're not saying they love child Elizabeth they just love a guy who defended a child molester but okay okay they happen to love Roy more and if you want to give him all the benefit of the doubt in the world they're not convinced that Roy Moore as a child molester yet even though there are credible enough allegations that the almost entire Republican Party of the national level has said that they are not endorsing him anymore and and some have said they won't even see him if he wins because he's that deeply immoral so that's not the Democrats that's a Republican saying it but if you're in the group that says no I still don't believe all those Republicans I don't believe the credit I don't believe anything okay maybe it's not that you're defending child molesters you just think that it's this is the issue at hand anyway so but Couric and all those guys this is look they've smashed the things and Hannity had a great time and and and that's the heart of this story yesterday as I reported to you he's like I love it go get him and he sent out tweet after tweet saying smash him I gotta bite you new coffee machines yes and then today I'm sure that somebody pulled him in on it both his radio show on Fox News to say hey showing you know we make most of our money from advertisers if the minute you get upset with an advertiser you're telling everybody to smash their product we're not going to get any new advertiser rights that's what I told you would happen yesterday and today that's exactly what happens so all of a sudden Hannity in a massive backpedal so let's take a look at the first video of him backpedaling a very important message tonight I'll explain please stop smashing your Keurig coffee machines I'm gonna explain how this company was totally exploited they are actually a victim in all of this I want to once again thank all of you for your support it blew me away but for now please please stop destroying your coffee machines as I've been saying Keurig they are a victim in this as of now today before this ever happened this weekend I have five Keurig machines five of them I have never supported a boycott in my life because I know what they're about they're about censorship and by the way gonna start tonight you fought back so tonight now please I'm calling for a ceasefire here I humbly appreciate your support but I'm asking you to not smash your Keurig now I as I said I own five cure eggs please stop destroying yours and by the way for the people who did later this week I have a big announcement I will be giving away 500 coffee makers now I'll decide on the brand that I'll be giving away in the coming days based on how things unfold oh is it gonna be Keurig pathetic I have five I have five Curie coffee makers please stop smashing them please please I love Keurig Keurig is the best oh my god please keep advertising with me by the way Keurig is again they did pull out they just apologized for publicizing it because in the CEOs word it gave the appearance of taking sides yeah I think that giving the appearance of taking the side against someone who defends a child predator is okay but nonetheless whatever advertisers finicky Bunch okay let's put it aside the politics for saying oh no no that was just awesome because now are you clear on who Sean Hannity works for okay and mr. tough guy mr. oh I'm principal Zhai fine what are you doing what are you doing please please I don't want you to break the curse I want you to caress them good curd good Keurig oh yeah okay fine I'll get back to my speaker coffee all over me who do you work for a Sean oh you work for your ab testers right the corporation's who buy ads on you that's okay that's okay just be honest about it well now you don't even have to be honest about it because even if your conservative you saw what happened there your tough guy Sean Hannity when it touches his pocketbook not so tough no he had a brute awakening
