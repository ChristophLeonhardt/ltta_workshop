it wasn't as much of an election as it
was a referendum on the presidency of
Abdel Fattah el-sisi
I promise to work for all Egyptians
without any discrimination
whoever renewed their trust in me and
gave me their votes is indifference from
those who did not
Egypt is for all Egyptians as long as
the differences do not corrupt the
nation essentially unopposed
Sisi had been hoping for a high voter
turnout the only way to know if
Egyptians approve of his leadership the
Election Commission announced 41% of the
60 million eligible voters cast their
ballots that's lower than the turnout
during the 2014 election that gave Sisi
his first term Abdel Fattah al-sisi 121
million an eight hundred and thirty five
thousand and three hundred and eighty
seven votes which represents 97 percent
of the votes each up shion's voted over
a three-day period but many polling
stations tended to look like this
just a trickle of people streaming in
state media tried to increase voter
turnout by telling people if they don't
head to the polls they can be punished
with a fine some Egyptians say they
received food payments and other
incentives to vote it wasn't a
competition there were no public debates
and Sisi was virtually guaranteed
reelection because his only opponent
Musa Mustafa Moussa supported him Moussa
was even part of the campaign to get
Sisi reelected other well-known and
popular contenders withdrew their names
saying they faced intimidation they were
either detained disqualified or forced
to abandon their campaigns they said the
vote was a charade and called for a
boycott and judging by the number of
people who went out to vote many may
have heeded that call
