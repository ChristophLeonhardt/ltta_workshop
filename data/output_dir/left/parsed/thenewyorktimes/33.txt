“Would you like Mark Judge
to be interviewed?”
“That would be
my preference.
I’m not sure it’s really
up to me, but ...”
Mark Judge.
It’s a name that keeps coming
up in the Kavanaugh hearings.
“Man, the old gym.”
So just who is Judge?
“And here’s something
very interesting.
This is the JUG room, 
Justice Under God detention,
spent a lot of time in there.
It’s locked right now but ...”
In this self-shot
video posted online,
he’s walking around the
campus of Georgetown Prep,
the school he attended
years earlier
with Supreme Court nominee
Brett Kavanaugh.
“And I know they’ve asked
me not to film here.
They’ve told me
not to film here.
They’ve explained
the legal ramifications
of filming here.
But, this is part of my
past and these videos
are part of my history,
so — bring on the lawyers.”
Christine Blasey
Ford says Judge
was in the room when,
she alleges,
Kavanaugh sexually assaulted
her in the early 1980s.
“She says that you tried
to take off her clothes
and she believes that
you would have raped her
if Mark Judge hadn’t
climbed on top
and everyone tumbled
to the floor.
And then she had an
opportunity to get away.”
Judge and Kavanaugh were
close friends in high school
and both have denied
the episode occurred.
Additional women have since
come forward with accusations.
“We're starting to learn
more about Mark Judge.”
Judge is now a key figure
in the Kavanaugh hearings.
In other self-shot videos,
Judge discusses things like
spirituality and pop culture.
“It’s about mysticism.”
He also produced
numerous short films.
Many reviewed by The Times
seemed like mood pieces.
They don’t have dialogue,
and almost all feature
young-looking women,
some almost naked,
posing or staring at the camera.
“I’ve been a journalist for —
since college, and ...”
Judge is a freelance writer,
author and filmmaker.
He has contributed to
conservative news sites
like The Daily Caller
and The Weekly Standard,
but also publications
like The Washington Post 
and The New York Times.
“I mean, I’m no
Andrew Breitbart,
but he is an inspiration.”
He has written
about topics ranging
from culture and conservatism
to masturbation
and male sexuality.
He has also written a
number of books, including
“Wasted: Tales of a Gen-X Drunk,”
where he recounts
drinking in high school
and includes a character
named Bart O’Kavanaugh,
a suspected reference
to Brett Kavanaugh.
After the
accusations surfaced,
Mark Judge’s
social media accounts
appeared to be taken offline,
and he has remained
out of the public eye.
