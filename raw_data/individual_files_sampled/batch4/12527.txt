the New York Times former newspaper says it has obtained a list of questions that special counsel robert muller wants to ask president trump as part of his investigation into imaginary collusion with russia during its completely ineffectual attempt to rig our election which is very important because fans have have my new and my name is show The Times reported that Muller had as many as 50 questions he wanted to ask the president including some questions like where do you get those great red ties and what club do you use off the fairway on the 4th hole at merrill ago that do not appear to have anything to do with russian collusion but since that's imaginary anyway the Special Counsel figured he might as well get a few golf tips and while he was at it but there are also some important and possibly tricky questions on the list including question 17 if you had colluded with Vladimir Putin what would you have said to him and could you please speak slowly and clearly into the potted plant while you're answering and if possible do a Russian accent there's also question 23 where's the collusion talk you smarmy lowlife or I'll smack you with this folk book question 36 if I admit I've been wasting the public's time money would you give me a job in your administration Trump's lawyers say they are weighing whether to allow the president to answer Muller or to sneak him out of the White House through the Rose Garden disguised as a chick-fil-a delivery guy Trump himself was unavailable for comment because he was busy ending the Korean War good morning I'm Andrew Clavin

and social justice warriors are just parasites and bullies they have these wonderful names socialist social justice words and just parasites and bullies they all they are yesterday was May 1st and May 1st you know I remember when May first we would dance around the Maypole and you know the nights would have joust and I go back a long way yeah you know it used to just be you celebrate spring and you celebrate love and it was lovely the lusty month of May as they said in Camelot and then in the 1800s when wizard was 1886 there was a big riot in Chicago and Haymarket Square was called the Haymarket riots very famous there was a big there had been a big strike of workers they were mobilizing for an eight-hour day and all these things and on May 4th the police came into the this into this demonstration and a bomb went off had killed cops I think it was and it killed four cops in like seven civilians I'm sorry kill seven cops and four civilians my mistake seven cops and four civilians a huge riot started the famous Haymarket Riot 8 anarchists were convicted one of them committed suicide several of them were hanged it turned public opinion against the workers movements but it also the workers now and got these martyrs from the Haymarket you know the guys who were killed because they said that they hadn't been proved that they were the guys who set off the bombs so now May 1st these guys go out and they protest for socialism and all around the world there are marches for socialism anarchists are out there you know like setting fires they're carrying pictures of Stalin and and the you know I mean they are this is Stalin I mean Salling was this guy you're sitting next to Stalin and he would say you know I'm going to appoint you my successor no I think I'll kill you instead that's what that's what it was it was like you lived in this palace with Stalin and he would just you know snap his fingers and they'd take your husband away or you away or your kids away and they'd shoot you down and this was after he had slaughtered tens of millions of people by causing famines in order to and he would say you know that well you know these are what did they call them I can't remember culottes something like that some word they had for these poor peasants who just had a little bit of land so they were chasing them off the land it really socialism is always a disaster it always is but here's the thing about it it always what the reason I call it a parasite is when you listen to people praise socialism what they do is it's globalism for me but for for me but not for these globalism for me but not for thee when an American worker loses his job but some poor worker gets a job because of globalization right so they the workers that we have who have rights and who get paid better they lose their job and the job goes off to another part of the world these citizens of the world types these elite globalists they say oh well you know it's all in all it's from it's a net gain you know yes so American workers lost their jobs but then worker in this poor country he got a job so it's a net gain for citizens of the world so they're big citizens of the world when it hurts America but but when America looks bad suddenly it's all one nation at a time so then they suddenly say well Norway you know people 'we are much happier that you know polls you know surveys actually show this people in norway are much happier because of the social spending there's all this social spending in norway and they're much happier than in america and my feeling is is yeah did they use cell phones because they were invented by capitalists do they use cars because those were invented by capitalists do they use computers invented in america do they use the internet invented by us everything they use that makes their life so happy came out of the competitive harsh world of capitalism do they have an army that would protect them if they're divided amir putin when they said you know what i'd like norway okay i think I'll have norway you know that it would be nice no they depend that they know that putin will invade them because our army protects them they live off capitalism if they're happy they're happy in the way children are happy maybe because my you know my when my kids were little they were happy because they didn't have to make a living for them you know that's why they're happy socialism is a he's a parasitical it's a parasitical system it just wins if if it doesn't live off capitalism if it doesn't use what capita limits has it collapses like you get in the soviet union like you're getting now in venezuela and then they have to build walls around the country to keep people out here in capitalist countries we build walls to keep people from coming in right but they're they want to build walls to keep their citizens out because people want to get out they don't they want to make money they want to do the things do things for you know for their own profit because they're human beings it's always it's always a parasitical system and because you know the thing about marx you know they had that article in the new york times i was making fun of yesterday happy birthday Karl Marx you were right March was right about nothing he was not in first of all his entire first premise is that capitalists make money by exploiting the workers and the reason he said this is because he's thought that the value of something you take some scrap metal some workers put together a car and now the scrap metal is worth more than the car so the workers must have added the value to the scrap metal but where they get the plans for the car where they get the money to build the factory where they get the money to build in all the cars you know you can hire another set of workers kind of hard to get that many billionaires to build factories and very to get somebody to come up with the idea of the car you know so it's like not really I mean workers do add value to material I'm not saying that they don't I'm just saying that they don't add the same kind of value that the capitalists add they don't add the same kind of value that the creators add and the other thing of course is if capitalists are exploiting the workers why is it that countries like ours where we have so many billionaires I think we have five times as many billionaires as the Middle East and Africa combined okay so you'd expect to see exploited workers all over the place instead you see workers who are fighting obesity you know they're they have you have to decide which cable channel to watch our workers our poor nevermind our workers our poor are the rich in other countries our poor are the upper middle class in Mexico I mean so people things go really well here and so yeah there's a relative disparity between the billionaire capitalist and his worker there's a bigger disparity maybe but but everybody is doing so much better because capitalism raises all ships everything about Marxism is wrong you know I had dinner with Rupert Murdoch once I told the story I I have a dinner who's me like three other guys and we just had dinner at Rupert's house up in the hills of Beverly Hill House you come in and the butler takes your jacket and offers you like what what can I get you and I like single malt scotch I figure it's Rupert Murdoch I bet he has my scotch he did you know they just go off gay oh it's just a beautiful beautiful thing and at one point mer I guess I can call him Rupert we had dinner together his Rupert said to me so you're you write screenplays and of course he has 20th Century Fox right he says if a man comes and and I've gotten this from studio heads before by the way if a man comes to my house and fixes my toilet I pay him once and not again if you come in and write a screenplay why do I have to keep paying your residuals so I began to answer him because the answer is I'm not as a writer I'm not a worker I'm a creator I'm actually inventing something so you have to pay me every time you use it and you're really getting off well because I you know it's not only socialists who don't understand how economics works it's billionaires but the thing about billionaire's is billionaires don't listen they talk this is absolutely true every billionaire I've ever met doesn't listen to you they talk and the reason they talk is because they figure if you were as smart as they were you'd have a it's true this is a there's a certain wisdom that billionaires have because they're like cops they see the worst in people because they almost never see anybody who's not asking them for something I mean people just feel like I remember we had a billionaire in a church I belong to and he loved me and I could never figure out what you know why does this guy love me because I never asked him for anything I never wanted anything I was you know I made my own living I didn't have to ask but everybody else was like I have this charity I had this fund I have this in business so they get a certain wisdom about people but they didn't understand understand where where the goodness of what I did was coming from and why I got paid on a perennial basis I mean here's a story true story right I I gave this what once in a speech about copyright because a lot of people don't think there should be copyrights you shouldn't be allowed to have an intellectual copyright I said let me tell you about copyrights here's how copyrights work I worked my fingers to the bone to become a good writer I really work I worked it through the night I would go to school sometimes a lot of times I didn't go to school but I would I would work through the night to become a really good writer I would read and read and read study study study to become a good writer one day after I had my daughter she's a little baby right I lived in an apartment in New York and we had walled off a little nook for the baby and we would sleep in the bedroom and every night I would walk across the living room to check on the baby to make sure she was still breathing right because you work that kid will just stop you know that's what that's what you do once you have kids you worry for the rest of your life one day I'm walking across the living room and I thought wouldn't it be weird or scary if I looked into the nursery and she was just gone and the baby was gone and I got this idea for a novel about kidnapping it became my novel don't say a word now when that idea occurred to me I was a practiced writer I had honed my craft I'd already won some awards for writing I was a really good writer that book became ultimately it became a best-seller but it also became a movie with Michael Douglas a lot of dollars were generated by that film it was the number-one film in the country when it came out it was the number-one DVD for weeks and weeks and weeks when it came out as a DVD it generated a lot of jobs okay now my life has generated jobs for a lot of people my creativity has generated jobs for a lot of people it is also put kids through schools I you know I would I I won't say put my wife through school because she was part of the money that I made so she put herself through school essentially but all of that fed into people becoming productive members of society what do socialists do what do socialists do they do nothing what do they create they create nothing what do they add to society nothing those guys who are marching in the streets in Europe and burning things and setting on fire where have they ever created a moment of wealth and penny of wealth all they talk about is how to pirate the wealth of other people and so they're complete parasites they're sitting there they think they're important because they've got their fists in the air they think they're important because they're screaming words like justice that they don't understand because justice meanings getting what you deserve it doesn't mean taking somebody what somebody else made and taking it for yourself that's not justice that's being a parasite so so they're complete parasites and when they then try to justify their existence by working for social justice a word that means not justice right because justice is a word it actually has a meaning it means people getting what they deserve social justice means taking from people who have earned things they become bullies they just that's all they do is their entire you know there's this girl out there and this is why by the way I talked about not apologizing why not apologizing is so important this girl keziah dom 18 year old girl do we have a picture of her can we put a picture of her she she posted her prom picture died absolutely lovely young lady 18 years old she's got this dress that looks like it has a kind of Chinese pattern I mean nothing but joy in this picture the guy is standing there thinking how did I get this lucky right he's thinking I just hope that keziah does not find out the truth about me because I'm like I am now the luckiest kid in America and he is she's absolutely beautiful she's adorable she's wearing the dress Twitter the bully place the place where bullies go because they don't get punched in the face as they deserve so they go on Twitter's because they can bully people they start one guy said what he said my my culture is not your prom dress guess what yes it is yes it is my friend your culture is her prom dress and my underwear because I am wearing Chinese underwear right this moment bitch pictures pictures of Chinese people on my but that's what it is because you don't own your culture you didn't do anything to create it you didn't do anything you haven't created anything all you are is a bully you're not a warrior you're not fighting your injustice you're just bullying a pretty girl who's given this guy joy and having joy and her Brahms just luckily luckily finally finally some of these people are standing up to these bullies and she did she said I would do it again I mean they just they just came after her and after it's like what what do these people produce what do they produce they don't even make my underwear my I had to paint those Chinese people in my underwear I have to do it myself so I really I'm really happy she's standing up for him I'm really happy this is something that is it is emanating from Donald Trump it is no question that is emanating from his pugilistic nature some of the things that are very disturbing about him the way he fights like a lion whenever anybody insults him but some of that is rubbing off on people Kanye West he is another one Kanye West West is on TMZ and he went on a rant and and I love when when people go on right-wing rants they're great you know they went raving or they lost it and said these things but he's just being if Kanye's just being Kanye at this point you know I was just talking to Knowles about this wonderful book called being there is made into a movie and being there is about this kind of complete innocent who walks around saying these kind of innocent things but everybody keeps interpreting them as wisdom and I feel like we're all doing that with Kanye now like I had no idea what God is talking about but he says he loves Donald Trump played the first cut this is a cut number two and it's just nice to hear the guy not backing down because they've been bullying from days Maxine Waters said we we have got to get control Kanye has got a rein you know it's like what businesses are hers what Kanye says anyway I like I just like the fact that he is saying what he's saying cut number two now if you want to ask me I don't have extremely strong political opinions you could talk to John Legend if you want some political I've never been into politics I just love Trump that's my boy like you know it's like so many rappers you look at a video of Snoop Dogg Love Trump but then he get in the office and I didn't love her like Trump is one of raps favorite people right but we talked about that before he was elected president people in hip-hop big it was it was an N thing to put Donald Trump in your rhyme somewhere and by the way I'm in hip-hop but I'm not just in hip-hop I'm a black person a black community but I'm not just I feel like one thing is people try to minimize me to artists hip-hop black community yeah I'm always gonna represent that but I also represent the world I represent now even the future it's the now I was an 18 we're in the now row you know mean and I represent the now and I represent what the possibilities of a new peaceful planet we're at the beginning of it you saw the North Korea but people denounced that and you say you said this thing you put this whole thing people love to say all every bah-bah-bah it's not that it's a hundred sides to every story so if you talk about Trump yeah there's things there's a laundry list of things that I don't have in front of me that my friends would text me or write me emails to say he did this this this this is this some of them Obama did too you know but he just it wasn't that you know as loud and said wow the room is quiet in here I heard the part the love-struck and that thing about Trump being and all those rap songs it's true because in rap you know they've always got the gold in the jewelry and Trump has that kind of you know rich guy belligerent rich guy attitude that they love that the rap guys love so he's absolutely right about this then he goes off on some other I have no idea what he's saying but I'm just glad he's saying it I really am I'm really glad that he is not backing down I think we should just celebrate that I am I like the guy the guy then he said this thing about slavery everybody got upset about this play that one you hear about slavery for 400 years for 400 years that's not like a choice like you was there for 400 years and it's all y'all you know like it's like we're we're mentally in prison I like the word prison because slavery goes don't too direct to the idea of blacks it's like slavery Holocaust Holocaust Jews slavery is blacks so prison is something that you nice as one race blacks and whites being in one race that we're one where with a human race prison prison unites us all we're all in prison as the human race I mean people were picking him because he said slavery is a choice obviously not although he said there were slaves here for 400 years I mean they haven't been there haven't been Europeans here for 400 years so I don't even know where that mean comes from I'm not sure what that it we or that thought comes from who knows what he's saying but Uncle Eddie I'm just glad he's out there I'm glad the other one Matt Groening you know they were picking on Appu that really broke my heart because I love Hank Azaria who was doing the voice of Appu and groaning said I'm proud of what we do on The Simpsons and I think it's a time in our culture where people love to pretend they're offended they'd love to pretend because there's power you know if you can bully an 18 year old girl into being sorry she wore a prom dress you're a big man you're a big man on Twitter you can go home you can go home you know it's brag to the guys yeah I bully I made an 18 year-old girl feel bad about her progress I mean that's who they are my favorite I think has been Roseanne I'm not even a fan of Roseanne I don't hate you I was out of the country when her show was big but but she has been she was on Jimmy Fallon and he brings up delicately because Fallon every time he touches Trump file it explodes in his face but Fallon asks her about this and she's again these guys are now demonstrating how not to apologize but then also with a big hit comes people that aren't so happy as well if you say that you're a supporter of Donald Trump oh yeah people are mad about that yeah yeah everybody well everybody had to choose for themselves according to their own conscience who they thought was the lesser of two evils you know everybody chose that so I'm not gonna put anybody down who didn't vote like me this is America it's a free country and you know when you weigh it all together you know I just think I just felt like we needed a whole new thing all the way bottom to top I see I just love this I love that this is happening is happening because of Trump it's also happening in support of Trump it is happening because of Trump it's happening because people are tired of these guys who don't produce anything they are parasites and then there are bullies there's no justice in it there's nothing social about it it is just parasitism and bullying and that's all it is and these people are creators you don't have to like Roseanne you have to like Connie but they create stuff they create jobs they create wealth they create money they create they do what capitalists do they make stuff that other people use that other people live off they invent stuff they make stuff they build stuff they create wealth and all the rest of these guys are just mouths and what they're asking for is a piece of the pie you know how you get a piece of the pie make a new piece make yourself a piece of the pie bake the pie become a creator because these guys as far as I'm concerned they can all pounce and your culture is my underwear that is that is what I want you to take away

watch the show there and ask questions in the mailbag it will change your life maybe for the better who knows alright the mailbag I was prepared for it this time you know I said I just have to get ready that's all I ask from Calvin Oh grand and wise one do you think we give too much credit to the left winning the culture war it seems like most people I talk to in my life on both sides of the political spectrum are ignorant to what is going on in the country and the world anyways you know I know I look I think that we sometimes get too crazed and fearful of the left but I think that if we don't pay attention the creep of the culture is really bad and has an effect before you know it it changes it moves the Overton Window which is the phrase they use for what is acceptable to say and it moves it steadily to the left I mean you have now Facebook declaring they're going to decide what is hate speech and what is a hateful site and what is a real news site and you can bet who's gonna suffer from that conservatives why because they're all leftist than they think leftism is true they don't understand that it's just an opinion that is a a that that is a creation of culture that's a creation of movies that's a creation of all those comics on late-night being all on one side all the comics on Saturday Night Live I mean this is why it's so important these people are fighting back so yeah people the thing about the culture is people don't have to know what it is they just have to go see Star Wars or Avengers or whatever and get that message coming through to them that some things are okay and some things are not okay some opinions are out of bounds you know there was a wonderful episode on Silicon Valley where a gay guy was running and he was running a website a dating website for gays and they found out he was a Christian and everybody went oh no no no no no we don't want you at the meeting we don't want you you know is there obvious that Christianity had become the new homosexuality just as prejudiced as people were before they had just shifted that prejudice over it is important to get those messages out it's important to get them out in in episodes that are not necessarily Christians are filled with the profanity and sex so that people are watching and get the joke and they see what's happening I think the culture is really important because it creeps up on you and it takes sometimes 20 years before to change an attitude but it's just like if you've ever stood on the shore and you feel the water the waves go into your feet and you feel it eating away the sand under your feet that's what the culture is like from Spencer Oh Lord protector of the realm of decency and cogent thought Clavin I was curious as to what drew you to write crime novels in particular as opposed to say science fiction or fantasy novels I wasn't because crime fiction more than other genres explore some specific aspect of the human condition that interests you yeah I mean partly it was an accident of my personal history if there are any accidents I doubt that but like it partly was the fact that I write about this in my memoir the great good thing was that looking for role models of how to be a man looking outside of my immediate family for role models of how to be a man I discovered the tough guy writers guys like Hemingway and Raymond Chandler and dodge lament and a lot of them were detective story writers so Raymond Chandler especially became an idol of mine someone I really admired because I admired his hero and wanted to be like that hero because he was a man who stood for something in a corrupt world that was what to me became sort of the image of what manhood was it was to stand for something and to be uncorrupt in a corrupt world but also it began to serve another part of my personality which is part of my personality both inborn I'm sure and because of my personal history which is an obsession with knowing truth from falsehood what I'll tell you I'll tell you something I have I have lived a enormous Lee fun life especially after the age of 30 I mean my first 28 years were little but after that it has really been an enormous ly fun life and but if I had to pick one thing that disappointed me it was my realization that people didn't care what the truth was I I thought I thought mankind moved toward truth and that people recognized truth when they saw it and things really and then I realized no it's like that's I mean Christianity got it closer you know they if the truth were incarnate and came to life we kill it you know that would that was that's Christian and he gets it exactly right and so the crime genre is all about people trying to find the truth it's whether it's a Hitchcockian drama like I tend to write where somebody doesn't know whether he's being hunted or why he's being hunted and suddenly his whole world has turned upside down or whether it's a simple straightforward mystery it's about people trying to find the truth and that has always just been an obsession and a gret the great story of humankind to me is the guy who stays non-corrupt and tries to find the truth from john deere's st. Clavin of the blest whoo-hoo-hoo christ spent much of his earthly ministry talking about caring for the poor and afflicted even beyond Matthew 25 there's plenty of evidence to suggest that Christ holds a special contempt for those who refuse to help the poor as someone who is generally conservative myself I wrestle with the sometimes conflicting assumptions about those in poverty that I hear in both the Gospels and dogmatic American conservatism I was curious how you personally deal with that tension or if you even find that tension to be there you know I don't find it oh I I find it the tension sometimes there between conservatives and Christian teaching but not between conservatism I don't think that Jesus was preaching to a movement or to a country I think he was preaching to you I think he was telling you what you should do with your life and so the my problem with social movements is a frequently they don't they should be judged as Thomas Sol would say they should be judged on their outcomes not on their intentions and so a lot of times for instance poor black people's lives were improving more before the Great Society that was geared toward helping them than they were after the Great Society because the Great Society has destroyed families by paying welfare to people who had illegitimate children and not allowing fathers to come in to the house because you lost your benefits so all of these things don't often work whereas you know if you give a man a sandwich he will eat that day I mean that's why you know that's why a lot of times I tell you don't give money to people on the street but but you know I believe in helping the poor I mean one of the tensions in my own life as I believe that God actually wants me to be doing the things that I'm doing that is to be writing to be speaking to communicate and sometimes when I volunteer my time to people who were underprivileged or I volunteer my time to people are trouble I sometimes feel that I'm not using my time but God meant me to use my time so there's a tension there but I do not feel that leftism helps the poor I feel it destroys economies I feel it destroys initiative I feel it destroys families it hates the family it has to hate the family because it wants all the power centered on the government it destroys associations that help the poor like churches and you know clubs and things like that so I do not feel it is good for the poor you cannot judge it on its on its intentions and on its language you have to judge it on its outcomes and I feel left ISM is actually bad for the poor ultimately all right from Peter king Clavin from a longtime subscriber first-time mail bagger today I was horrific ly disturbed by a conversation regarding Alfie the British baby sentenced to death by bureaucracy and socialized health care the men I was chatting to all young professionals in their early 20s wanted him to die they not only defended the decision to let Alfie die they defended Iceland's policies of aborting babies who show signs of Down syndrome and said parents shouldn't determine if a life should be saved because not every life is worth living how do we go on as a society is there a way to save these people this is the battle we're in this is the battle we're in it's not about taxes it's not about anything else it is the battle to preserve the concept of life and the concept of humanity as as a sacred the concept a concept of a person is a sacred individual who is experiencing life in a unique way that deserves to be preserved you know I think that we we this is the argument we should be having all the time I mean it's not a question of preaching this question of living it it's a question of acting being an activist for it there is a whole strain of intellectual thought that essentially says the brain the mind is an illusion the self is an illusion that you are just flesh what they don't understand is that most religious people most thoughtful religious people feel yet yes you are just flesh but your flesh is in it is an incarnation of a spirit you know it's not that the Spirit is somewhere else or it's that a ghost in the machine that's not an idea that really holds together and really it never did is much more like the Catholic notion that you are incarnate and incarnate something an incarnate person and so I you know I don't know what to tell you except that there the there is going to be this battle this is going to be the conflict of our age it is the thing we're trying to fight against it is the thing we're talking about it is the reason we bring up God from time to time and the importance of the soul and who will win you know that is only that is in God's hands we know we win eventually but but whether we will win today that's always the question from Ricardo to the grand Fantasie author Clavin I finally finished another Kingdom another Kingdom the fantasy pond cat podcast starring Michael Noel's I finally finished another Kingdom and it was great what are your favorite literary tropes that you never tire of reading also don't tell moles but his performance in another kingdom was stellar by the way if you haven't listened to another kingdom we were working on the second season so coming here the first season you can get it wherever podcasts are sold its Andrew Clayton's another Kingdom performed by Michael moles when you say with literary tropes I'm not sure exactly what you mean what I love I love the moment in a story whether it's in a movie or a book when you get the story that's one of my favorite things now one I always think of is die hard I love that moment when you realize oh I get it the terrorists have taken over the building but at this tough cop is in there barefoot and unarmed or he just has a gun and I get that's the story or you think of Lethal Weapon where you know you think oh I get it Mel Gibson is so nuts he's so crazy that he is a lethal weapon so he will be his craziness will be the lethal weapon I love that moment in stories I love stories any story where a mystery has to be solved and it doesn't have to be a murder but I just love any story that starts with a question like what how are we gonna do this how is this gonna happen what happened we were talking a little while ago and stuff I like about the aspirin papers what we know what are the suspense that's just created when you do not know what's gonna happen next that those are the things those are the moments that I love the moments when a story congeals and you get what the story is I mean there are some writers who don't even do that some great writers Dickens occasionally doesn't do that trollope hated plots you know you know you hardly know sometimes what a trial novel is about they're still great writers but I just love that moment when you think Oh Hamlet you know he's supposed to avenge his father but he can't because he doesn't know what the truth is and you think like if you took Hamlet out of that story and put in a fellow who's too quick to guess at what the truth is then it wouldn't be that story it's as wonderful coming together of character and plot that's the thing I'm always looking for and what I do and what other people do from James Clavin Oh Lord of the deplorable a topic for discussion in one of my classes I wanted to get your take on can someone be moral without believing in God my professor made the argument that even someone who lives by traditionally moral values without believing God is even more moral because they're doing so without fear of Hell or hope of having that's ridiculous I mean that argument is just as ridiculous as it can possibly be you don't do good because you fear hell and hope for heaven you'd do good as a part of a pathway that you believe goes into the next life you believe that the moral order is larger than any given life including yours and that you will get to partake of that moral order as you go forward beyond this life that's why you do it it's not it's not as some kind of payoff and even the idea that people who don't believe in God are doing it for some just because they're just that good he's just not human nature everybody does good for their own purposes and because they feel good about it there's always a measure of selfishness about it we never are detached from any of that however can a non-religious person be moral absolutely of course you can of course non-religious people can be moral the problem is their morality makes no sense that is the problem and the big problem about making no sense is that sometimes under stress when you make no sense you have nothing to fall back on and I you know I just finished I've talked about reading this book by Steven Pinker he's a humanist and he says oh just the doing good for the the best the most benevolent thing you do for everybody is the most benevolent thing you can do for yourself and it just makes perfect sense it doesn't because there's never a reason when you can get away with something not to get away with it you know God if if there is a good and a bad let me put it the other way if there's a good and a bad I'm moral good and a bad there must be something toward which those tend there must be a good toward which that goodness tends right something that is good must be closer to good than it is to bad so there must be an ultimate good what is the nature of an ultimate good in order to be a moral good it has to have a will right you can't a hurricane isn't good or bad it may be bad for you but it's not it's not doing evil it has to have a will you have to end it will has to be free in order to choose good or bad so the ultimate good is going to be a will that wills good and that is as close as you can get to a definition of God off the cuff so I think that once you talk about morality at all once you believe once you believe here's what you have to believe the leap of faith you have to take to get to God so this is it it's not even a leap of faith as this tiptoe of faith the leap of faith you have to take is that if every single person on earth were a Nazi Nazism would still be wrong there was a time on earth when every single person believed in slavery slavery was still wrong when every single person believed that it wasn't right back then and people just didn't you know and people got to define it how they they wanted to define it it's not an opinion it is not an opinion once you believe that there's such a thing that's objective more moral good you're stuck with God and so the point the point my only point is of course you can be a good person anybody can be a good person you can be a bad person and believe in God but if you want to have a moral system if you want to believe that there's a moral system and you want you to be making sense when you do it you have to believe in God all right I want to move on to just one other thing in the mail back there and just talk about this fight that's going on between Congress and the Justice Department which is really interesting to me some and people in Congress are drafting articles in of impeachment against Rod Rosenstein saying he's stonewalling on giving documents subpoenaed documents to Congress they especially want documents about the investigation to Hillary's email and so here's congressman Matt gates describing what they're looking for and why rod Rosenstein shouldn't be standing and opposing them I think mr. Rosen Stein ought to be more worried about what he's put his name on for example the FISA warrant renewal after the FBI knew that Christopher Steele was lying and was not trustworthy Rosenstein himself signed the document to spy on an American citizen with no justification he also put his name on the pleading to silence the whistleblower in the uranium one case now I'll say this rod Rosen Stein's understanding of extortion seems to depart from the law the definition of extortion is forcing someone to do something that they have no legal obligation to do under some threat rod Rosenstein has an obligation to follow the law that's all we want him to do and what's most telling about his viewpoint are his most recent comments to the New York Times where he said he doesn't believe that the Congress has a constitutional authority to conduct oversight I think that means he's not reading article one correctly particularly our power to appropriate funds and then of course ensure that those funds are used in accordance with the law here the FBI and Department of Justice departed from the law they did so because they were out to get Donald Trump and now they want to evade oversight and it's something we're not going to let him do so now the left is saying that the reason they're doing this and coming after Rosenstein is because there running interference for Trump and so that's their argument and Rosenstein the thing that Gates has wrote was referring to he was giving a speech for law day at the Newseum the Museum of News in Washington and the end he said this he was laughing at their articles of impeachment because it's just a draft that leaked to the press here's what he said and so I just don't have anything to say about documents like that that nobody has the courage to put their name on and that they leaked in that way but I can tell you there are people who have been making threats privately and publicly against me for quite some time and I think they should understand by now the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted we're gonna do what's required by the rule of law and any kind of threats that anybody makes are not gonna affect the way we do our job we have a responsibility and we take it oh that's the whole point when you take these jobs you need to be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate and that actually is a pretty thorough process and then you raise your right hand and you swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic you promise to bear true faith and allegiance to the same and you take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion so help me God and that's your responsibility now I'm not gonna take a side on this yet because I think that that Rosenstein I haven't got a read on roses he's a very hard guy to take a read on there's a lot of things that they've said against him a lot of things are said for him but you know so far I I do not want to see the Justice Department compromised and I don't want to see Congress compromised either however I will say this this talk about the rule of law is very high but when you have James Comey going around selling his book and talking about the rule of law after he leaked memos that were almost certainly the property of the government and certainly classified information he was asked the other day what would have happened if Hillary had won and I just want you to listen to the pomposity with which of this guy goes to the rule of law and his imaginary world of Hillary Clinton listen to this what would your life be like if she won I also don't know the answer that I think I would still be the FBI director and the reason I say that is someone asked me to compare the two and it's too hard for me to compare the two except Secretary Clinton is someone deeply enmeshed in meshed in the rule of law respect for institutions a lawyer and so given that background reasonably confident that even though she was unhappy with decisions the FBI had made she would not fire the FBI director as a result Hillary Clinton was deeply immersed in the rule of law here in case you've forgotten that is trey Gowdy cross-questioning James Comey about hillary clinton statements to the FBI Secretary Clinton said there was nothing mark class of auto and her emails either sent or received was that true that's not true there were a small number of portion markings on I think three of the documents Secretary Clinton said I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email there is no classified material was that true there was classified material emailed Secretary Clinton said she used just one device was that true she used multiple devices during the four years of her term as Secretary of State Secretary Clinton said all work-related emails were returned to the State Department was that true no we found work-related emails thousands that were not returned so I am all for rod Rosen scene and the Justice Department in the rule of law but it doesn't really sound like their idea of the rule of law is the same as the rule of law that's what that's all I'll say about this for now all right tickety-boo news this is from Stephen Moore The Economist and Trump supporter he says the Energy Information Administration reports that the US could surpass Saudi Arabia in oil and gas by the end of the year with massive oil and gas shale reserves we could be number one in the world before the end of the decade The Wall Street Journal confirms that US oil production is expected this year to surpass Saudi Arabia's and that we will rival Russia for in the world American production will rise to almost 11 million barrels a day the most ever in American history doesn't it seem like yesterday when the left was running around shrieking about peak oil more like peak idiocy last week Reuters argue that the American shale boom should be called Donald Trump's revenge the story reported that US oil now floods Europe at the expense of OPEC and Russia it couldn't have happened to a couple of nicer guys America is now selling more than a half billion half million barrels a day thanks in no small part to the end of the oil and gas export ban in 2016 what all of this means is that we are getting very close to the day when America returns to becoming a net exporter of oil this would reduce our trade deficit by more than 200 billion a year Saudi Arabia is still a major player in the market that can move the world price by turning on and off spigots which is why we've had this recent spike in gas prices to more than $3 a gallon and that's due to Russia and Saudi Arabia's production cuts but the OPEC nations can no longer hold the world hostage as they did in the 1970s when we had gasoline lines and price controls and had to bow to the Saudi oil sheiks this is great news and you know why you know why it happened it happened because we have property rights it happened because you can own the land beneath the land and so it made sense for capitalists to develop fracking to get out that extra energy and that is why it is happening is because of capitalism capitalism produces stuff socialism lives off the stuff that capitalism produces because they're parasites and bullies I'm Andrew Clavin this is
