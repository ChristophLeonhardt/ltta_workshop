1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
I'm afraid there's not gonna be cell
service elliptical service and it's

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,940
coming some cases water for weeks or
months this was a devastating hit from a

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,820
category for 155 mile per hour storm
category five starts at 157 so split

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,050
hairs with me
so 155 miles per hour storm not that far

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,150
from Alma Cal or from where our reporter
was in Palmas Dalmar so it will zoom in

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,050
for you here this storm coming in right
very right here you can honestly see

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,308
that we don't have a radar for you
because they soon as the storm rolled

8
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,050
onshore it knocked out the Puerto Rico
radar and you can't just say hey let me

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,960
get Miami or let me get you know
Melbourne in Florida

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,050
there's just nothing out there once we
lost that one there was not another one

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,670
to be found here the Doppler radar at
the terminal where the airport is wasn't

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,579
working either
there's Puerto Rico the winds so

13
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,559
honestly I would say the entire island
saw hurricane force winds and much 2/3

14
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,120
of the island saw 100 mile-per-hour
winds so that's taking out power lines

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,069
taking down trees just putting damage
down that is unimaginable for a wooden

16
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,479
structure that's why we please ask you
to be in a a metal or some kind of

17
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,500
concrete building and I think most
people did they knew how bad this was

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,479
and also st. Croix was truly hit near
Frederiksted that's the area here as it

19
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,630
went over in the overnight hours in the
dark somewhere around 3 o'clock in the

20
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,869
morning we're going to see rainfall
we're gonna see 20 inches of rain and

21
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,619
that will cause flooding that may be the
biggest concern from where we are now

22
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,540
the eye is losing intensity we're down
to 145 miles per hour it's still

23
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,890
southwest of San Juan and we'll be
moving offshore probably in the next two

24
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,119
hours but where does it go from here
because for the entire time the models

25
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,390
were saying yeah it's gonna stay
offshore well overnight they kind of

26
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,380
changed their mind slightly now it's
still offshore but it's closer to shore

27
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,390
closer to shore close enough that
nowhere along the East Coast can be just

28
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,200
put this away and say it's not going to
hit us because this is still days away a

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,640
week away before it hits the US and let
me you know we know two-day forecasts

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:00:00,000
are about as good as we get not 7 or 9
day forecast in a hurricane
