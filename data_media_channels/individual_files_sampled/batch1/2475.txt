I've never once not since I was 18 I've never once had a credit card so consequently I don't really have like such a great credit score so the only thing that's been a problem for me is when I've been renting a place and I just had to pay an extra month security deposit everybody's where all my credit rating is gonna go bad if I miss one payment they always threaten you with that your credit ratings going to go bad you never have to worry about it by the way when I bought a house my credit rating was bad so I paid an agency $2,000 and my credit rating went from like 620 to 790 in two weeks you shouldn't have credit card debt to begin with but if you're having financial problems and the bank's calling you every day stop paying back your credit card debt the bank has a contract with you where it knows you might not pay it back if you're fired from your job for instance and suddenly you can't pay back your credit card debt don't think to yourself oh my gosh the bank is calling me just work it out with the bank you can usually work it out at ten twenty cents on the dollar then you hire our company to fix your credit rating the whole credit rating thing is like a scam
