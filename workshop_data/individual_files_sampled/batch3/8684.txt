Laura: ABC CANCELED THE HIT SITCOM "ROSEANNE" TODAY AFTER A SERIES OF BIZARRE TWEETS FROM THE SHOW’S START EARLIER THIS MORNING. THEY INCLUDED A RACIST REMARK ABOUT VALERIE JARRETT, TOP ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT OBAMA. SHE APOLOGIZED PROFUSELY AFTER SHE WAS SEVERELY CRITICIZED BUT THAT WASN’T ENOUGH TO SAVE HER SHOW. VALERIE JARRETT RESPONDED ON NBC TONIGHT. I THINK WE HAVE TO TURN IT INTO A TEACHING MOMENT. I’M FINE. I’M WORRIED ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DON’T HAVE A CIRCLE OF FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS WILL COME RIGHT TO THEIR DEFENSE. THE PERSON WHO WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET WHO’S MINDING THEIR OWN BUSINESS AND THEY SEE SOMEBODY CLING TO THEIR PURSE BUT WANT TO CROSS THE STREET. Laura: WE ARE JOINED BY ALVEDA KING, FORMER MEMBER OF THE GEORGIA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. THE NIECE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING. I WENT TO START WITH YOU BECAUSE THIS WAS A BREAKNECK SPEED CANCELLATION OF THE MOST POPULAR NETWORK TELEVISION SHOW OF THE SEASON. A HUGE SMASH HIT. SHE APOLOGIZED, BUT THE COMMENTS IN THE EYES OF A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE PRETTY INEXCUSABLE TO SAY THE LEAST. YOU KNOW, THIS ACTUALLY IS A TEACHABLE MOMENT. I’M 67 YEARS OLD AND I DO USE SOCIAL MEDIA, BUT I TRY TO STOP AND MAY BE PRAY OR THINK OR CONSIDER WHAT I’M ABOUT TO TWEET OR PUT ON FACEBOOK OR INSTAGRAM OR LINKEDIN OR ANY OF THOSE BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL HEAR THAT OR SEE THAT OR READ THAT AND AS YOU SAY, ROSEANNE’S REMARKS MOVE LIKE LIGHTNING. THEY JUST MOVE EVERYWHERE AND THEN ABC RESPONDED AND I BELIEVE APPROPRIATELY. SAYING WE JUST HAVE TO STOP THE SHOW. THERE HAS TO BE A MESSAGE THAT THIS IS NOT WHAT WE ARE ABOUT. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS A TEACHABLE MOMENT. UNFORTUNATELY FOR ROSEANNE HERSELF. Laura: I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THIS. THERE SEEMS TO BE NO POSSIBILITY OF REDEMPTION IN CERTAIN CASES. YOU HAVE REDEMPTION FOR JOY BEHAR. LET’S REMIND EVERYONE WHAT SHE SAID NOT SO LONG AGO. IT’S ONE THING TO TALK TO JESUS. IT’S ANOTHER THING WHEN JESUS TALKS TO YOU. EXACTLY! THAT’S DIFFERENT! THAT’S CALLED MENTAL ILLNESS IF I’M NOT CORRECT. Laura: ANDREA MITCHELL POSED THIS VERY ODD QUESTION TODAY, LET’S WATCH. WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO ON SOCIAL MEDIA TO GET FIRED FROM A TOP RATED SHOW ON AN AMERICAN BROADCAST NETWORK? Laura: GIVEN HER PASSED COMMENTS ABOUT HOMOSEXUALS IT WAS KIND OF IRONIC. A LOT OF COMMENTATORS AND COMEDIANS HAVE SURVIVED THESE OFFENSIVE COMMENTS WHEN THEY HAVE APOLOGIZED. DIFFERENT ONE ROSEANNE BART TOUCHED RACE. IF THIS WAS A SPECTACULAR SELF IMMOLATION. A NANOSECOND ABC PULLING THE PLUG. IT COST ABC A LOT OF MONEY BY THE WAY. ROSEANNE SAID SHE WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD AND CONTINUE TO SPEW ANGER. Laura: YOU SEE THE DOUBLE STANDARD. CHRISTIANS ARE MOCKED AND RIDICULED, AND ENTIRE CLASSES PEOPLE RIDICULED. SOMEONE IS WAS AN APOLOGY, MAYBE MAKES A PHONE CALL AND CAREER PRESERVED. IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW THE ISSUE OF RACE HAS REACHED A FEVER PITCH BOILING POINTS. IF WE HAVE GOTTEN THE MESSAGE YET FROM MY UNCLE FOR EXAMPLE, REVEREND MARTIN LUTHER KING JR., WE MUST LEARN TO LIVE TOGETHER AS BROTHERS OR PERISH TOGETHER AS FOOLS, WE ARE NOT UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE ONE RACE, ONE HUMAN RACE SO WE ARE STILL IN THESE RACE WARS AND BATTLING. IT’S JUST AN ABSOLUTE TERRIBLE THING TO TAKE A RACIAL SLUR AND KIND OF THROW IT OUT THERE LIKE THAT. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL AS HUMAN BEINGS, RED-BLOODED HUMAN BEINGS, OUR SKIN COLOR REALLY DOESN’T DEFINE US, IT’S A CHARACTER THAT DOES. WE ARE NOT COLOR-BLIND. WE CAN SEE ETHNICITY AND WE SHOULD BECAUSE IF WE IGNORE OR SAY WE CAN’T SEE SKIN COLOR AND WE CAN’T SEE THE OPPRESSION AND THE WRONGDOING THAT HAPPENS EVEN DOWN TO THE LITTLE BABIES IN THE WOMB ALL THE WAY TO ALL PEOPLE. SO FIGHTING OVER SKIN COLOR REALLY IS THE PROBLEM BUT THAT’S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AND THAT’S WHY I SAY IT’S A TEACHABLE MOMENT. THE RACISM REALLY DOES HAVE TO GO AND WE REALLY HAVE TO BEGIN TO REGARD AND RESPECT EACH OTHER AS HUMAN BEINGS. Laura: HEAR, HEAR. DID ABC NOT KNOW THOUGH WHAT THEY WERE GETTING WITH ROSEANNE? VENTURE WAS COMMENTS IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" IS THAT YOU CAN’T CONTROL ROSEANNE. LET’S GET HOW WE END ON THIS. MANY WHO HAVE TRIED AND FAILED. SHE’S THE ONE AND ONLY. ABC KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS GETTING WITH ROSEANNE. SHE HAS BEEN SPREADING CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT 9/11 TO NAZIS FOR MANY YEARS. IT WAS A GAMBLE THAT SHE WOULD ZIPPER LEFT AND IT DID CREATE A FUNNY SHOW. TOUCH A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY BUT ABC CANNOT CLAIM TO BE BLINDSIDED. THERE’S ONE MORE POINT HERE. I WAS JUST WAITING, COUNTING DOWN CNN’S DON LEMON. ROSEANNE AT PRESIDENT TRUMP. Laura: THEY ARE PUTTING IT ALTOGETHER. EVEN VALERIE JARRETT WAS TAKING THE HIGH ROAD AND SHE WAS SORT OF BLINDSIDED HERE. THIS HAS NOTHING TO TO DO WIH DONALD TRUMP. THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA TURNED EVERY NEGATIVE CONTROVERSY INTO A TRAP STORY. Laura: WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT TYING THIS TO DONALD TRUMP, WHICH IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING IN TWEETS. THE GUY FROM SCANDAL, ACTOR JOSHUA MOLINA SAID ABC IS GREATER THAN G.O.P. OTHERS TWEETING SIMILAR THINGS, DONALD TRUMP CREATED THIS ATMOSPHERE FOR SOMEONE LIKE ROSEANNE TO TWEET THAT THINKING SHE PROBABLY COULD GET AWAY WITH IT. I BELIEVE ROSEANNE PERHAPS. AS I SAY, TEACHABLE MOMENT. JUST THOUGHT SHE COULD SAY OR DO WHATEVER SHE THOUGHT. Laura: BUT DID DONALD TRUMP CREATE THE ATMOSPHERE? NO, NO, NO. NO HE DID NOT. I VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP. I’M NOT A RACIST. Laura: I THINK THAT’S OBVIOUS. WE ARE NOT RACIST. TO TIE THIS ONE PARTICULAR ACT FROM ONE PARTICULAR PERSON AND SAY THAT IT’S DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP’S FAULT, THAT’S JUST NOT TRUE. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD NOT DO THAT. Laura: WILL SOMEONE ELSE PICK UP THE SHOW? I THINK IT’S VERY HARD TO COME BACK FROM THIS KIND OF RADIOACTIVE CONTROVERSY. Laura: SO NO ONE WILL PICK UP THE SHOW? THE MOST POPULAR SHOW OF THE YEAR. NO ONE WILL PICK IT UP? ANY OF THE CAST AND CHARACTERS? THEY ARE ALL OUT OF JOBS. SOME OF THE PEOPLE WERE SAYING THEY WERE LEAVING. THAT’S THE SAD THING HERE. WITH THIS SELF-DESTRUCTIVE ACT, ALL THE WRITERS AND TAPE EDITORS AND PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT BE SO EASY FOR THEM TO FIND JOBS, THEY’LL GET Laura: IT’S A SHAME. I SELECT ONE MINUTE OF IT.
