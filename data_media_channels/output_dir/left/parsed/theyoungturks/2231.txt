THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION
HAS OFFICIALLY FILED A LAWSUIT
AGAINST THE STATE OF FLORIDA
FOLLOWING RICK SCOTT'S DECISION
TO SIGN LEGISLATION THAT
REGULATED GUNS A MINIMAL AMOUNT.
NOW, THE NRA TOOK ISSUE WITH THE
FACT THAT FLORIDA HAS NOW BANNED
PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF 21 FROM
PURCHASING FIREARMS.
ACCORDING
TO THE NRA, THEY SAY THEY FILED
A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE STATE FOR
VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS OF 18 T0 21-YEAR-OLDS,
THEY ALSO SAID THAT THIS BAN
VIOLETS THE RIGHTS OF
LAW-ABIDING FLORIDA CITIZENS.
THEY ALSO ARGUE THAT IT IS BAD
FOR WOMEN, IT INFRINGES ON
WOMEN'S RIGHTS EVEN MORE BECAUSE
WOMEN POSE LESS OF A RISK WHEN
IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL
SHOOTINGS.
THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS IN 1000
DIFFERENT WAYS.
FIRST OF ALL,
WOMEN ARE LESS PRONE TO BE
ALCOHOLICS, SO DOES IT IMPINGE
UPON THEIR RIGHTS THAT THEY
CAN'T BUY A BEER BEFORE 21?
I
THINK EVERYONE SHOULD BE ALLOWED
TO BUY A BEER AT 18, BUT THAT'S
NOT THE LAW WE HAVE AND IT'S NOT
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
THEY ARE GOING
TO SAY SECOND AMENDMENT, BUT MY
POINT THERE IS WE DON'T DO LAWS
BASED ON, WELL, WHO IS MORE
LIKELY TO DO X OR Y?
THAT'S A
BAD IDEA OVERALL, I KEEP HAVING
TO EXPLAIN THAT TO THE RIGHT
WING.
IN THIS CASE THEY ARE
HIDING BEHIND WOMEN TO TRY TO
MAKE THEIR CASE.
LIKE POOR
WOMEN, YOU ARE TAKING AWAY THEIR
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS -- I'M
SURE THESE NRA GUYS ARE ALWAYS
BASHING MEN ON A REGULAR BASIS.
NO, IT'S JUST A WAY TO HIDE
BEHIND THEM.
BUT TO ME THE HEART
OF THE STORY IS THE NRA SAYING
WE ARE ABOVE THE LAW, WE DON'T
CARE WHAT ANYONE THINKS.
WE
ALREADY CONTROL THE POLITICIANS.
AND THESE GUYS STEPPED OUT OF
LINE FOR A SECOND ON A TINY
LITTLE ISSUE, SO WE ARE GOING TO
GO BREAK THEIR BACK AND SERVE
EVERYONE ALSO LESSENED, AND WE
DON'T CARE WHAT 97% OF THE
COUNTRY THINKS, WE ARE IN CHARGE
AND YOU AREN'T. THIS IS THE
ARROGANCE OF POWER.
AND WHEN THE NRA KIND OF
ENCOURAGES A FRAMING OF STATES'
RIGHTS, THE STATES MADE THEIR
DECISION.
THE STATE MADE ITS
DECISION, AND YOU ARE GOING TO
COMPLETELY GO AROUND THAT AND
SUE THE STATE?
WHICH JUST
REVEALS YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
IDEOLOGY, THERE IS NO
IDEOLOGICAL FRAMING, YOU AREN'T
THERE TO PROTECT THE SECOND
AMENDMENT, THE NRA, THE SECRET
DECODER RING YOU PLUG IN THERE
IS THE NRA JUST WANTS TO SELL
MORE GUNS, THAT'S ALL THEY ARE
THERE FOR.
THERE ARE PARTS OF
THE FLORIDA BILL THAT MAKE IT
MORE LIKELY THAT TEACHERS WILL
BE ARMED, THERE IS LANGUAGE
SETTING DOWN THE FOUNDATION FOR
THAT CHANGE, SO I THOUGHT THEY
MIGHT NOT COME AFTER IT.
BUT THEY GOT A LOT OF LAWYERS
SITTING AROUND AND A LOT OF
MONEY TO SPEND ON THEM, SO THEY
WILL DO IT.
HOW MANY KIDS YOU THINK GET
SHOT THE FIRST YEAR?
HOW MANY
WILL TEACHERS SHOOT?
BECAUSE
THAT IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
THEY WILL BE AFRAID FOR THEIR
LIFE.
SOME TEACHERS HAVE ALREADY
BEEN FOUND SAYING WEIRD STUFF,
LIKE WEIRD, SUPER RACIST STUFF
ABOUT KIDS.
I SAW THAT STORY.
THERE'S
ANOTHER STORY I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU COVERED, THERE WAS A TEACHER
FREAKED OUT IN SCHOOL WITH A
GUN, DID YOU COVER THAT?
HE
BARRICADED HIMSELF IN A
CLASSROOM, THE PRINCIPAL TRIED
TO GET IN WITH THE KEY, HE SHOT
THE GUN, AND SO NOBODY GOT HURT
THANKFULLY, BUT WE ALL KNOW
THOSE TEACHERS THAT ARE -- WE
ALL HAD TEACHERS THAT WERE RIGHT
ON THE EDGE, AND GUYS LIKE ME
TRY TO PUSH THEM OVER.
THAT'S HOW COMICS ARE BORN.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.
LET ME JUMP IN REAL QUICK
ABOUT A POINT YOU MADE, CENK,
AND HOW THE ALCOHOL THING, THE
ALCOHOL ARGUMENT YOU MADE IS A
LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THE
SECOND AMENDMENT, THE SECOND
AMENDMENT DOESN'T PROTECT
ALCOHOL RIGHTS, IT PROTECTS GUN
RIGHTS.
BUT EVERY AMENDMENT IN
THE CONSTITUTION HAS
LIMITATIONS, AND THE SECOND
AMENDMENT SPECIFICALLY MENTIONS
A WELL REGULATED MILITIA.
SO TO
SAY -- LIKE, UNDER THE NRA'S
LOGIC JIMMY'S EXAMPLE OF THAT
TEACHER WHO LOST IT AND
BARRICADED HIMSELF, HE SHOULDN'T
HAVE HIS GUN TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE
THAT'S VIOLATING HIS SECOND
MOMENT RIGHTS.
NO, THERE ARE
LIMITATIONS TO EVERY
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.
BUT
THE NRA KEEP SPREADING THIS
NONSENSE PROPAGANDA MAKING IT
SEEM AS THOUGH EVERYONE, YOU ARE
ON THE TERRORIST WATCH LIST, YOU
GET GUN RIGHTS, YOU ARE ON THIS
LIST, THAT LIST, YOUR BRAIN
HASN'T FULLY FORMED YET YOU
SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY AN AR-15.
THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO EVERY
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT, PERIOD.
WAIT, IF AN 18-YEAR-OLD HAS A
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A GUN,
WHY DOESN'T A 17-YEAR-OLD, OR A
THREE-YEAR-OLD?
WE HAVE TO DRAW
THE LINE SOMEWHERE AND THE STATE
IS ALLOWED TO DRAW IT IN A
REASONABLE PLACE.
SO 21 IS THE
BARRIER FOR A LOT OF THE AGE
LIMITS IN THE COUNTRY, AND HENCE
WHY I BRING UP ALCOHOL, SO OF
COURSE YOU CAN SAY YOU HAVE TO
BE 21 BEFORE YOU CAN BUY A GUN
IF IT'S ALSO THE SAME AGE FOR
YOU TO BE ABLE TO BUY A BEER.
SO
THAT'S A REASONABLE PLACE FOR
THE GOVERNMENT TO DRAW THAT
LIMITATION.
AND IF YOU SAY THERE
ARE NO LIMITATIONS, THAT'S NOT
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AT ALL.
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW SAYS EVERY
AMENDMENT HAS SOME LIMITATIONS.
YOU CAN'T YELL FIRE IN A CROWDED
THEATER, AND YES YOU CAN TAKE
THE GUNS AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO
HAVE USED GUNS IN VIOLENT CRIMES
BEFORE, AND YES YOU CAN LIMIT IT
SO THAT SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS CAN'T
HAVE THEM, OR IF THEY WANT,
19-YEAR-OLDS CAN'T HAVE THEM.
WHAT ELSE GETS ME IS THE
TIMELINE WHERE THEY FILED THIS
LAWSUIT.
AFTER GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT SIGNED
THIS LAW INTO EFFECT, THE
NRA HAD THEIR LAWSUIT FILED
WITHIN ONE HOUR.
THAT'S A GREAT POINT BY BRETT,
BECAUSE WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO
DO IS TEACH POLITICIANS A
LESSON.
NEVER, EVER CROSS US, WE
DON'T CARE HOW MANY KIDS DIED IN
YOUR STATE, WE DON'T CARE HOW
MANY MASSACRES THERE WERE, WE
DON'T CARE WHAT THE PUBLIC
POLLING SHOWS, REMEMBER, WE ARE
IN CHARGE.
SO THAT'S WHAT THEY
ARE TRYING TO DO HERE, AND ONE
LAST THING THAT MAKES ME SICK
ABOUT THIS WHOLE SET OF
CIRCUMSTANCES IS NOW RICK SCOTT
IS PUT IN A POSITION WHERE HE
HAS TO DEFEND THIS LAW, WHICH
WAS ONLY A TINY, TINY PIECE OF
REGULATION, AND IT MAKES RICK
SCOTT, A BARBARIC RIGHT-WINGER,
LOOK MODERATE.
BECAUSE ATTILA
THE HUN IS TO THE RIGHT OF HIM
NOW.
SO IT'S A WIN/WIN FOUR
CONSERVATIVES IN THAT SENSE.
BUT
AT SOME POINT I THINK THEY ARE
GOING TO MUSKOKA LATE AND THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT JUST FOR
FEDERAL BACKGROUND CHECKS, NOT
JUST FOR GUN CONTROL, WHICH 97%
ARE FOR FEDERAL BACKGROUND
CHECKS, 70% ARE FOR GUN CONTROL
OVERALL -- BUT I HAVE TO GET
MONEY OUT, BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE
ARE RUBBING OUR FACES IN IT
SAYING I OWN YOUR POLITICIANS, I
OWN THE COURTS, OUT EVERYTHING,
AND YOU ARE POWERLESS, YOU WILL
HAVE TO SIT THERE AND WAIT UNTIL
THERE IS A SCHOOL SHOOTING
WHERE YOUR KIDS GO TO SCHOOL.
AND AT SOME POINT 
THEY WILL HAVE
A REBELLION ON THEIR HANDS.
