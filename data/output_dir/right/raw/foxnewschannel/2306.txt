1
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:13,753
>>> I SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT

2
00:00:13,753 --> 00:00:14,653
THIS MORNING OF SOUTH KOREA.

3
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:16,989
HE GIVES US TREMENDOUS CREDIT.

4
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:18,424
AND REMEMBER, ITER WAS VERY

5
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:23,295
ROUGH THREE, FOUR MONTHS AGO.

6
00:00:23,295 --> 00:00:25,898
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP TOUTING HIS

7
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:27,133
INVOLVEMENT IN THE HISTORIC END

8
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:28,868
TO THE KOREAN WAR.

9
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:30,069
SO DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP DESERVE

10
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:32,604
CREDIT FOR THIS DIPLOMATIC

11
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:35,608
ACHIEVEMENT AND PERHAPS

12
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:37,309
EVENTUALLY THE NOBEL PEACE

13
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:37,710
PRIZE?

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,012
OUR NEXT GUEST THINKS SO.

15
00:00:40,012 --> 00:00:41,680
JOINING US IS A NATIONAL

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,049
SECURITY EXPERT AND THE DIRECTOR

17
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:46,485
OF THE INTERNATIONAL STUDIES.

18
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:47,887
OUT THE GATES YOU MAKE THE CASE

19
00:00:47,887 --> 00:00:50,489
THAT THIS IS WORTHY OF A NOBEL

20
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:50,790
PRIZE.

21
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,223
EXPLAIN WHY.

22
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:51,991
>> I DO, PETE.

23
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:53,726
I THINK ACTUALLY IT'S A SLUM

24
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:54,693
DUNK TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

25
00:00:54,693 --> 00:00:56,962
THINK ABOUT IT LIKE THIS FOR A

26
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:57,296
SECOND.

27
00:00:57,296 --> 00:00:59,231
WE GAVE, YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT

28
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:02,401
OBAMA THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR

29
00:01:02,535 --> 00:01:04,003
BEING PRESIDENT OBAMA AND NOT

30
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:05,203
BEING GEORGE W. BUSH.

31
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:06,572
IF THAT'S THE CASE, YOU HAVE TO

32
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:08,808
GIVE THE NOBEL PRIZE TO DONALD

33
00:01:08,808 --> 00:01:09,208
TRUMP.

34
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,676
CONSIDERING THE FACT HOW FAR

35
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:12,044
WE'VE THE COME WITH THE NORTH

36
00:01:12,044 --> 00:01:12,711
KOREA CRISIS.

37
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:14,313
GO BACK TO JANUARY WHEN WE WER

38
00:01:14,313 --> 00:01:16,615
TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, A

39
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:17,616
BLOODY NOSE OPTION WITH NORTH

40
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:17,917
KOREA.

41
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:19,852
WE WERE ACTUALLY STARING DOWN

42
00:01:19,852 --> 00:01:22,621
THE PRECIPICE OF A NUCLEAR WAR.

43
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:23,556
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE

44
00:01:23,556 --> 00:01:25,291
DIED IF THAT HAPPENED.

45
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,293
CONSIDERING HOW FAR WE'VE COME

46
00:01:27,293 --> 00:01:29,461
AND WE'RE ON THE BRINK OF

47
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:33,699
SOMETHING HISTORICALLY

48
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:33,933
SOMETHING HISTORIC.LLY

49
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:37,069
>> CRITICS SHOULD SAY WHAT IF IT

50
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:39,905
ALL FALLS APART, WHAT IF IT GOES

51
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:41,373
SIDEWAYS, WHAT IF THE NUCLEAR

52
00:01:41,373 --> 00:01:42,575
AMBITIONS RAMP UP, WHAT IF?

53
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:44,977
>> WE'RE STILL IN A GOOD

54
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:45,344
POSITION.

55
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:47,513
THE PRESIDENT'S MAXIMUM PRESSURE

56
00:01:47,513 --> 00:01:49,515
CAMPAIGN IS THE OLD COLD WAR

57
00:01:49,515 --> 00:01:50,816
PLAY BOOK OF CONTAINMENT.

58
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:53,786
THIS IS WHAT WE DID TO THE

59
00:01:53,786 --> 00:01:56,055
SOVIET UNION FOR 50-PLUS YEARS

60
00:01:56,055 --> 00:01:57,423
AND THIS IS HOW WE WERE ABLE TO

61
00:01:57,423 --> 00:01:59,892
PUT THEM IN A NICE LITING BOX

62
00:01:59,892 --> 00:02:02,127
AND THE SOVIET UNION COLLAPSE

63
00:02:02,127 --> 00:02:04,697
PPED.

64
00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:04,964
PD.

65
00:02:04,964 --> 00:02:06,098
THE SAME THING CAN HAPPEN TO

66
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:06,799
NORTH KOREA.

67
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,434
THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF MONEY.

68
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:09,835
THAT MEANS WITHIN A COUPLE OF

69
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:11,070
MONTHS NORTH KOREA WILL ACTUALLY

70
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,238
BE BANKRUPT.

71
00:02:12,238 --> 00:02:15,674
YOU CAN'T BUILD A LOT OF NUCLEAR

72
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:17,843
WEAPONS, OR ICBMs.

73
00:02:17,843 --> 00:02:20,379
>> OTHERS SAY IT SHOULDN'T BE

74
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:21,046
JUST PRESIDENT TRUMP.

75
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:23,415
YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT PRESIDENT

76
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:26,051
MOON, CHINA AND XI SAYING HE'S

77
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:29,188
FINALLY PUTTING PRESSURE ON.

78
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:30,956
BUT ANY

79
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:30,990
BUT DNY

80
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,156
BUT DOY

81
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:32,958
BUT DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS

82
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,194
HAPPEN ABOUT FORCEFUL AMERICAN

83
00:02:35,194 --> 00:02:35,594
LEADERSHIP.

84
00:02:35,594 --> 00:02:38,397
>> ABOUT ABSOLUTELY NOT.

85
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:39,598
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID TO THE

86
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:41,333
PRESIDENT YOU NEED TO ATTACK

87
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,068
NORTH KOREA OR YOU NEED TO DO

88
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:46,672
WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA DID,

89
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:47,873
STRATEGIC APPEASEMENT AND LET

90
00:02:47,873 --> 00:02:49,341
NORTH KOREA HAVE THE NUCLEAR

91
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:49,742
WEAPONS.

92
00:02:49,742 --> 00:02:51,677
THE PRESIDENT TOOK THE HARDER

93
00:02:51,677 --> 00:02:53,345
ROAD AND PUT THE MAXIMUM

94
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:54,446
PRESSURE CAMPAIGN ON THE NORTH

95
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:56,382
AND THAT GOT US TO THE TABLE.

96
00:02:56,382 --> 00:02:58,617
HE PUT PRESSURE ON THE CHINESE

97
00:02:58,617 --> 00:03:01,353
WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID WERE

98
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:02,187
IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT WORKED.

99
00:03:02,187 --> 00:03:05,624
>> AT WHAT POINT DO WE LEARN OR

100
00:03:05,624 --> 00:03:09,161
LEST

101
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:09,595
LESSON.

102
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:14,433
BEFORE RONALD RIGHT L THERE WAS

103
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:15,701
JIMMY CARTER AND BEFORE THIS

104
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:16,468
PRESIDENT THERE WAS PRESIDENT

105
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:16,769
OBAMA.

106
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:18,504
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO LEARN THAT

107
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:19,571
STRENGTH IS WHAT BRINGS PEOPLE

108
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:21,040
TO THE TABLE AND BRINGS DOWN

109
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,640
EVIL EMPIRES.

110
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,510
>> IT'S STRENGTH AND DIPLOMACY.

111
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,245
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WE PUT A LOT

112
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:27,413
OF PRESSURE ON THE NORTH KOREANS

113
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:29,081
BUT WE ALSO SAID THAT THERE IS A

114
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:31,717
SEAT AT THE TABLE FOR THEM IN

115
00:03:31,717 --> 00:03:32,751
THE WORLD COMMUNITY IF THEY'RE

116
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:34,253
WILLING TO CHANGE THEIR

117
00:03:34,253 --> 00:03:34,620
POLICIES.

118
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,120
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

119
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,690
NOBODY WANTS TO OSTRACIZE THEM

120
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,491
AND NOBODY WANTS A WAR WITH THE

121
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:39,959
NORTH KOREANS.

122
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,226
BUT IF THEY'RE WILLING TO GIVE

123
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:43,762
UP THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN A

124
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:44,863
VERIFIABLE WAY WHERE WE CAN

125
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:46,098
PROVE THAT THEY'VE DONE IT,

126
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:48,267
THERE ICE GREAT THINGS AHEAD FOR

127
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:48,867
THEM.

128
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:49,668
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.

129
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:53,072
>> THE 2009 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE

130
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:55,374
GIVEN TO PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS FOR

131
00:03:55,374 --> 00:03:59,745
HIS EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS TO

132
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:00,346
STRENGTHEN INTERNATIONAL

133
00:04:00,346 --> 00:00:00,000
DIPLOMACY.
