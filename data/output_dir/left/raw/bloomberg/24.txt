1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,620
I'm Kim Bhasin, luxury
reporter at Bloomberg,

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,520
here to invite you into
the most exclusive realms

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,713
of luxury retail.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,463
This is Invitation Only.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,890
Today, I'm in Chelsea,
the Manhattan neighborhood

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,490
with everything a fancy
person could ask for.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,840
Tons of super expensive art.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,510
A bustling, pricey market.

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,860
And a formally posh hotel
turned historic landmark.

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,380
Once home to notable fancy
guests like Lillie Langtry,

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,703
Milos Forman, Jane
Fonda, and Bette Midler.

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,050
So with its knack at preserving
old beautiful things,

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,460
it shouldn't be a surprise
that Chelsea is also home

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,340
to the world's fanciest
used clothing shop,

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,728
New York Vintage.

16
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:52,500
(doorbell rings)

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,600
Hi.

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,433
Hello.

19
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:55,569
Hi, welcome.

20
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:56,402
How are you?

21
00:00:56,402 --> 00:00:57,568
I'm good, how are you?

22
00:00:57,568 --> 00:00:58,401
Great!

23
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,420
So we're in our retail store
right now, the bottom floor,

24
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,620
which is open to the public and
anybody can come in and shop

25
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,013
and purchase these wonderful,
rare pieces of vintage,

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,320
and then the second floor
is a private showroom

27
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,320
that houses over a 150
years of important fashion.

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,540
Balenciaga, Halston,
Schiaparelli, Fortuny, Worth,

29
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,800
really special, rare pieces
that are museum caliber,

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,400
basically impossible to come by.

31
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,310
Downstairs, all these pieces are for sale.

32
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,690
Upstairs they're for rent.

33
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,690
Who shops up there?

34
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,640
Who's allowed up in the treasure trove?

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,780
We work with editors and
stylists for industry use,

36
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,900
but we have a lot of our
private clientele, celebrities

37
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,290
that will come up for fittings
for various events as well.

38
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,150
What kind of celebrities?

39
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,540
Um, every kind. (laughs)

40
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,670
The A-list kind.

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,200
Do your dresses show up on the red carpet?

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,400
Oh all the time, absolutely, yeah.

43
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,480
And to see the clothing kind
of take on a different life

44
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,483
is incredible.

45
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,199
To get an appointment upstairs,
can anyone just walk in

46
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,779
or call you and get an
appointment to go check it out?

47
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,260
It's not that easy. (laughs)

48
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,890
You have to have credentials.

49
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,723
Do you vet people?

50
00:02:14,723 --> 00:02:15,556
We vet people.

51
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:17,020
Everyone is vetted before they have access

52
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,270
to the archive, absolutely.

53
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,520
Am I allowed up there?

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,390
Um, I'll let you have a peek. (laughs)

55
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,068
I'll give you a little guided tour.

56
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:26,485
(upbeat, rhythmic music)

57
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,650
Oh, look at this.

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,090
Ready to be inspired?

59
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:33,923
Uh-huh.

60
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,110
So over here we have an
Adrian, this is 1930s.

61
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,180
He designed costumes for over 250 films

62
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,840
during Hollywood's Golden Era.

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,060
Jean Harlow, Joan Crawford, and Garbo,

64
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,130
all of these ladies wore his gowns.

65
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,600
He's known for this silhouette,
the bias 1930s dress.

66
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,475
These are corsets from the 1880s.

67
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:55,720
1880s?

68
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,370
Uh-huh, 1880s.

69
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,910
We have some examples of
some McQueen headpieces.

70
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,323
Over here we have Gianni Versace.

71
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,890
Back here we have a bra
that was worn by Lady Gaga.

72
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,690
I believe this was just for an editorial.

73
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,840
Just to wear, 'cause she's
Lady Gaga, of course.

74
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,140
And by the way, this
belonged to Josephine Baker,

75
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,100
so this bra is from the 1920s,

76
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,170
a lot of famous breasts were... (laughs)

77
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,050
At this rack.

78
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,700
Well at this rack (laughing)...

79
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,877
So this is the famous
Sarah Jessica Parker,

80
00:03:27,877 --> 00:03:30,150
"Sex and the City" bird.

81
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,240
(dramatic orchestra music)

82
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,480
Has anyone tried to buy this off of you?

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,070
I would say the most
interesting solicitation was

84
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,490
from a Saudi princess who
was buying up everything

85
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,590
from "Sex and the City" the film,

86
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,730
and offered a very large sum of money.

87
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,080
Of course we turned it down--

88
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,340
How large is large?

89
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,173
Six figures.

90
00:03:50,173 --> 00:03:51,697
Oh, for this bird.

91
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:53,047
Yes for this little bird.

92
00:03:55,393 --> 00:03:58,226
(slow, deep bass)

93
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,630
I've had some moments where
I've realized the impact

94
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,493
we've had on the fashion industry.

95
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,660
I can share an experience
a few years ago where I was

96
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,260
up in my showroom just working away.

97
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,110
I had my three children running around me

98
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,817
and I get a call on my cell
phone from the White House,

99
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:17,637
"We'd like to put Michelle
Obama in vintage."

100
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,310
Just never knowing what or
who you're working with,

101
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,950
knowing that somehow you
inspired someone to take an idea

102
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,943
and to run with it.

103
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,030
So you're hearing all this talk

104
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,110
about the retail
apocalypse, retail is dying,

105
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,660
how is that affecting this business?

106
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,390
It's so scary, I've been
here for almost 20 years

107
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,550
and I don't think that anybody on my block

108
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,030
is really standing since we first opened,

109
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,100
and I think that the reason
why we haven't really

110
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,220
been impacted is because
it is an experience

111
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,700
when you come here.

112
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,610
We've been asked by schools
to have private tours,

113
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,020
we've opened our archive
to students for research,

114
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,100
you just feel good coming in and you feel

115
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,564
like you've walked into a time
capsule of fashion history.

116
00:05:05,564 --> 00:00:00,000
(laughs) All in one place.
