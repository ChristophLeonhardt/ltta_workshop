the protesters demands have been clear they want the government to scrap plans to raise income tax by as much as 5% some say until that happens they need to keep applying pressure we're here because the citizens cannot take anymore this is too much this was the straw that broke the camel's back a number of shops pharmacies and hospitals went on strike but the protests were smaller than in previous days some said they wanted to see what the Jordanian government's next move would be on Tuesday king abdullah appointed a former economist as the new prime minister we think this new government will take action therefore we have a different opinion about this strike and we will not participate but the anger is still simmering and there are fears the government won't give people relief from a tax law protesters believe will unfairly burden the poor and the middle class Jordanians are struggling with rising prices and an official unemployment rate of more than 18% has forgiven a chance to the new government give them a chance but people are not optimistic as they think it's the same as a previous government but with new faces and not with new policies an influx of refugees from Syria and Iraq has strained resources in a small country that has always been heavily reliant upon foreign aid the proposed tax hike is part of a number of reforms requested by the International Monetary Fund Jordan is 37 billion dollars in debt digging itself out of that debt and reviving the economy may mean things get worse before they get better Natasha aegon al-jazeera
