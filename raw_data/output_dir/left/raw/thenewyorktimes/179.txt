1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
“We don’t have
good trade deals.”

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,920
“Nafta is the worst trade
deal maybe ever signed.”

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,127
“Do we make any
good deals anymore?”

4
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,860
“Let me be clear.

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,180
These tariffs are
totally unacceptable.

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,160
The American administration
has made a decision today

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,530
that we deplore
and obviously is

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,890
going to lead to retaliatory
measures, as it must.”

9
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,910
“There were
different scenarios,

10
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,810
but obviously today,
unfortunately, the worst case

11
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,390
scenario was presented,

12
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,840
which is imposing tariffs
on your allies.”

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,680
“I regret the protectionist decision
of the U.S. administration

14
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,460
on steel and aluminum.

15
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,780
I’m hoping that it will be
possible to avoid

16
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,250
an escalation, because we don’t
want to have a trade war.

17
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,380
We want to have a
real dialogue with the U.S.

18
00:01:35,380 --> 00:00:00,000
But again, I regret
such a decision.”
