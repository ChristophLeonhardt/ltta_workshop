THAT IS A CRIME, SHE HAS TO BE
HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
>> Martha: CORY, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE
TONIGHT.
SO MY NEXT GUEST IS A FORMER
TRIM PAINT SR. ADVISER WHO WAS
DRILLED BY A SPECIAL COUNSEL
MUELLER'S TEAM YESTERDAY.
AND HE JOINS US NOW IN AN
EXCLUSIVE.
MICHAEL CAVUTO, THANK YOU FOR
JOINING THE PROGRAM TONIGHT.
>> THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME.
>> Martha: ALREADY QUESTIONED
BY THE HILL, BUT YESTERDAY YOU
SAT DOWN WITH MUELLER'S FOLKS,
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?
>> YESTERDAY WAS MY THIRD TRIP
TO WASHINGTON IN ORDER TO TALK
ABOUT THE RUSSIA COLLUSION,
DELUSION.
AND IT WAS WITH MUELLER, AND
WITH SENATE INTELLIGENCE.
IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT
I DID AT SENATE INTELLIGENCE AND
WHAT I ENDURED AT THE SELECT
COMMITTEE LAST YEAR.
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION WAS
REALLY NOT TRYING TO DEFINE
SOMETHING.
EVERY QUESTION THEY ASKED, THEY
ALREADY HAVE THE ANSWER TO.
SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THEY ARE
QUITE DIRECTIVE IN WHAT THEY ARE
DOING.
THEY STILL BELIEVE IN THE THEORY
OF RUSSIA COLLUSION, BUT OF
COURSE MY PERSPECTIVE IS A
LITTLE BIT TILTED, BECAUSE I
WOULD NOT BE ASKED ABOUT
OBSTRUCTION, I WAS NOT IN THE
ADMINISTRATION WHEN THESE
ALLEGATIONS WERE LAUNCHED, AND
THEY WOULD NOT ASK ME ABOUT
FINANCIAL CRIMES, BECAUSE I HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH SOME OF THE
ALLEGATIONS AROUND SOME OF THE
OTHER FOLKS.
IT WOULD BE ALL RUSSIA
CONCLUSION YOU WOULD THINK, BUT
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THAT IS NOT
CLOSED YET.
>> Martha: NOT THE SPECIFIC
QUESTIONS, BUT IN TERMS OF YOUR
FEELING FROM WHAT THEY WERE
ASKING, DID YOU GET ANY SENSE OF
HOW FAR ALONG THEY ARE OR IF
THEY SEEM TO BE WRAPPING THIS UP
OR WHETHER THEY ARE MIDWAY
THROUGH?
DID YOU GET ANY INDICATION OF
THAT?
>> I THINK THAT THEY ARE PRETTY
FAR ALONG, WITHOUT INTERFERING
WITH THE INVESTIGATION, I HAVE
TO BE QUITE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT I
SAY, IN FACT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT
OF AN INTIMIDATING SESSION, SO I
AM BEING OVERCAUTIOUS.
>> Martha: HOW SO?
>> IS VERY CLEAR THAT THEY DID
NOT WANT ME TO TALK ABOUT THIS
STUFF.
AND I THINK THAT I CAN
CHARACTERIZE WHAT I EXCHANGED
WITH THEM, BUT I THINK THAT
EVERYBODY HAS BEEN ON CAUTION BY
THE MUELLER TEAM GOING OUT THERE
AND TALKING ABOUT A CHAPTER IN
VERSES, HIGHLY DISCOURAGED.
IF SOMEBODY OVER THERE GETS MAD,
THEY CAN INVITE ME BACK TO
WASHINGTON.
>> Martha: I UNDERSTAND, AND I
DO NOT DOUBT IT.
IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION, AND I
KNOW THAT YOU CANNOT TALK ABOUT
THEM SPECIFICALLY, BUT IN TERMS
OF THE WAY THAT THEY WERE
QUESTIONING YOU, DO YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU ARE A TARGET OR THAT
YOU, WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE AWAY?
DID YOU WALK OUT FEELING, OKAY,
I AM DONE AND THEY GOT WHAT THEY
WANTED AND THEY DO NOT NEED
ANYTHING ELSE FROM ME?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY TOLD ME
AT THE BEGINNING AND THE END,
AND MY ATTORNEY WHEN THEY
INVITED ME AND I DECIDED TO COME
WILLINGLY THAT I AM A WITNESS,
NOT A SUBJECT OR A TARGET.
AND AFTERWARD THAT DID NOT
CHANGE, BUT I THINK THAT THEY
WERE LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY
TO MAKE ME A SUBJECT IN THIS
THING, BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY
ARE TALKING ABOUT WIKILEAKS AND
D.C. LEAKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
>> Martha: YOU SAID THAT THEY
KNEW MORE ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN
THEY NEEDED YOURSELF, WHAT DID
YOU MEAN BY THAT?
>> I ACTUALLY SAID THAT THEY
KNOW MORE ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN
THEN ANY ONE PERSON DOES WHO
WORKED THERE.
THEY HAVE ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS
THAT WERE PRODUCED.
THEY HAVE ALL OF THE EMAILS FROM
EVERYONE.
THEY HAVE FURTHER DOCUMENTATION
FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE
CAMPAIGN, THEIR EMAILS, THEIR
TEXT.
THEY KNOW CHAPTER AND VERSE ON
THE CAMPAIGN, AND YET, IT DOES
NOT SOUND LIKE THEY HAVE PROOF
OF COLLUSION DELUSION.
>> Martha: MICHAEL CAVUTO,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT, AND
