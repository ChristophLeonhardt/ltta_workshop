1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,060
OBVIOUSLY THERE

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,030
ARE ANY NUMBER OF THREATS FOR
THOSE AFFECTED BY THE FLOODING,

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,570
PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL IN HOUSTON
AND SURROUNDING AREAS, BUT THE

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,510
WATER HOLD THREATS OF ITS OWN,
NOT JUST FROM THE AMOUNT OF IT

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,510
BUT WHAT IS IN IT.

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:20,240
THERE ARE
THINGS YOU MIGHT KNOW ALREADY --

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,779
THOSE SORTS OF PROBLEMS AREN'T
GOING TO SIMPLY GO AWAY ONCE THE

8
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:24,779
RAIN GOES AWAY.

9
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,971
THERE WILL BE
STANDING WATER IN AREAS WHERE IT

10
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:31,529
IS NORMALLY THEREFORE LITERALLY
MONTHS GOING FORWARD, MOLDS WILL

11
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,290
GROW FOUR YEARS GOING FORWARD.

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,150
THAT'S A REAL THREAT AND IT'S

13
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,960
BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY, BUT THERE
ARE SOME NEW THREATS PARTICULAR

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,680
TO THIS AREA AND THIS STORM, IT
HAS TO DO WITH TOXIC CHEMICALS

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,620
AND OTHER SORTS OF THINGS THAT
AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE

16
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,830
WATER NOW BEING FLOODED INTO IT
--

17
00:00:46,830 --> 00:01:00,500
THOSE ARE SOME TOXINS THAT I
WON'T TRY TO PRONOUNCE BUT THAT

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,729
WILL THEORETICALLY BE LEACHED OR
DUMPED INTO THE WATER AND

19
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,259
TRANSPORTED THROUGH THE WATER,
THROUGH WHAT BECOME TOXIC RIVERS

20
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:12,490
DOWN THE MAIN STREETS OF
HOUSTON, AND ONCE THE WATER

21
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,671
FINALLY GOES AWAY, THOSE
CHEMICALS, THOSE TOXINS, CAN

22
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:18,799
THEN SETTLE IN AREAS WHERE YOU
MIGHT NOT EXPECT THEM.

23
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,799
YOU ARE

24
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,729
LOOKING POSSIBLY AT BALL FIELDS
AND PARKS, PLACES WHERE KIDS

25
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,499
CONGREGATE, IN STORES, IN
PEOPLE'S HOMES, THAT'S A PROBLEM

26
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:29,509
THAT WILL NEED TO BE TAKEN
SERIOUSLY IN THE MONTHS AND

27
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:32,189
YEARS AFTER THIS STORM.

28
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,189
NOW --

29
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:42,229
BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MANY
SITES, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

30
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:45,389
AREAS THAT DIDN'T NECESSARILY
HAVE MUCH OF A WARNING BEFORE

31
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:48,380
THE STORM HIT, SO I THINK IT
NEEDS TO BE TAKEN VERY

32
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,159
SERIOUSLY, THE THREAT THAT OF
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

33
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,780
CONTAMINANTS AND TOXINS COULD
EVEN NOW BE BEING TRANSPORTED

34
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,799
AROUND HOUSTON AND OTHER CITIES
IN TEXAS AND SOON LOUISIANA.

35
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,409
MORE BAD NEWS.

36
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:03,560
JUST IN JULY WE
HAD THE FIRST CASE OF ZIKA VIRUS

37
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,590
IN THE HOUSTON AREA.

38
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,440
NOW WITH
MOSQUITO BORNE ILLNESSES THAT

39
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,510
COULD BE RAMPANT IN SITUATIONS
LIKE THIS, THE THREAT OF THE

40
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,439
ZIKA VIRUS IS GREATLY MULTIPLIED
IN THE HOUSTON AREA.

41
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,439
FURTHERMORE

42
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:19,549
LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE, VERY
DANGEROUS, THAT YOU CAN GET FROM

43
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:23,750
INHALATION OF AIRBORNE MOISTURE
DROPLETS.

44
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,750
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO

45
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,820
DRINK THE TAP WATER, IT'S
AIRBORNE, THAT'S POTENTIALLY

46
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,200
DEADLY.

47
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,390
THERE'S A GREAT IRONY
HERE, WHICH IS THAT THE MORE

48
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,990
WATER YOU HAVE, THE LESS USABLE
WATER YOU HAVE.

49
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,069
THE AREAS WHERE

50
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:42,629
THEY GET THE TAP WATER, THE
CLEAN WATER, GET FLOODED BY THE

51
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,959
DIRTY WATER, THEN YOU CAN'T USE
THE TAP WATER.

52
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,280
ON TOP OF ALL THE

53
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,980
HUMAN DAMAGE THAT'S ALREADY BEEN
DONE, 30 PEOPLE KILLED AT LEAST

54
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,800
SO FAR, 30,000 OR MORE
DISPLACED, WELL, YOU NOW HAVE A

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,239
SITUATION WHERE ALL THE LOCAL
RESIDENTS, NOT JUST IN THE

56
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,170
AFFECTED AREAS BUT THE ONES THAT
DRINK THAT WATER FROM THE TAP,

57
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,120
HAVE TO BOIL ALL THE WATER AND
THEN USE IT FOR -- OR JUST GET

58
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,709
DRINKING WATER THAT IS BOTTLED
-- IT IS A NIGHTMARE.

59
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:10,709
THINK

60
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,189
ABOUT HOW YOU TAKE SHOWERS,
HOW YOUR KIDS BRUSH THEIR TEETH,

61
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:17,700
ALL THE WAYS THESE PEOPLE WILL
BE AFFECTED, AND THEN THE MOLD

62
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,610
SETS IN WHERE THE FLOOD HAS HIT,
THAT CAN LAST FOR YEARS AND

63
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,780
YEARS AND HAVE MORE HEALTH
CONSEQUENCES.

64
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,269
THIS IS A TOTAL

65
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,299
NIGHTMARE FOR HOUSTON.

66
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:32,260
IT'S BEEN GREAT TO SEE PEOPLE
FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY

67
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,050
OBVIOUSLY SENDING BOTH MONEY BUT
ALSO THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED

68
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,549
THAT ARE STILL STUCK THERE,
PEOPLE IN TEMPORARY HOUSING

69
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,090
OUTSIDE OF IT, I SAW EARLIER
TODAY SHAUN KING WAS HELPING TO

70
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,060
ORGANIZE THAT BY SPREADING A
LIST OF THINGS THAT WERE NEEDED,

71
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,739
THINGS YOU MIGHT NOT NORMALLY
THINK OF, AND THAT'S GREAT BUT

72
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:50,860
PEOPLE NEED TO BUCKLE UP FOR THE
LONG HAUL BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE

73
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,470
PEOPLE WHO LEFT AREN'T GOING TO
BE ABLE TO GO HOME IN THE END,

74
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,819
EVEN ONCE THE WATER GOES AWAY
THEIR APARTMENTS WILL BE

75
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,840
UNINHABITABLE, MANY PEOPLE FIND
THEY HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS

76
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,140
BECAUSE BUSINESSES WILL HAVE
BEEN DESTROYED, PEOPLE WILL NEED

77
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:08,659
HELP IN THE NEAR AND MEDIUM
TERM, NOT JUST NEXT WEEK.

78
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:13,860
ONE MORE TIME, THIS IS NOT
ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THAT MIGHT

79
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,260
HAPPEN LATER.

80
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,220
THIS IS CLIMATE
CHANGE.

81
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,608
IT JUST HAPPENED.

82
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:19,608
IT HIT

83
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:21,779
HOUSTON, AND IT HIT IT REALLY
HARD.

84
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:22,780
IT'S HITTING LOUISIANA

85
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,930
TODAY.

86
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,169
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE
SCIENTISTS PREDICTED.

87
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:28,169
WHETHER

88
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:31,120
YOU WANT TO LOOK AT A POPULAR
MOVIE LIKE AN INCONVENIENT

89
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:39,780
TRUTH, JUST GOOGLE IT, GO
ONLINE, FIND ANY SCIENTISTS NOT

90
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,970
FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM
INSTITUTE, AND THEY WILL TELL

91
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,410
YOU -- AND DON'T LOOK AT WHAT
THEY ARE SAYING TODAY, LOOK AT

92
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,600
WHAT THEY SAID A YEAR AGO, 10
YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS AGO.

93
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
IN

94
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,930
FACT, LOOK AT WHAT THE EXXON
MOBIL SCIENTISTS SAID IN 1979,

95
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,090
1982, THAT'S A STORY WE COVERED
LAST WEEK.

96
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,090
TURNS OUT, THIS IS

97
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,160
SOME GREAT INVESTIGATIVE
REPORTING, THEY FOUND THE

98
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,370
INTERNAL DOCUMENTS, THE EXXON
SCIENTISTS SAY IT'S GOING TO BE

99
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,340
CATASTROPHIC, AND EXXON BURIED
ALL THAT RESEARCH.

100
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,340
WHY?

101
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,340
BECAUSE

102
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,849
IN THE SHORT TERM THEY WANTED TO
MAKE THE MONEY AND PUT THE COST

103
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:15,000
ON YOU.

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,099
AMERICA, THESE ARE THE
COSTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, THESE

105
00:05:18,099 --> 00:00:00,000
ARE THE CHICKENS COMING HOME TO
ROOST.
