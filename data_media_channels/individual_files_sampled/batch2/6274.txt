this Intel story gets weirder and weirder okay you got 32 you got 32 class actions filed against Intel and what's what it's about and in addition to that there's a derivative suit that I'd like to talk about series yeah so here you got you've got security flaws talk about the story lay it out a little bit the the security flaws are in the chips which isn't in every computer known to mankind I mean I don't care what you own whether it's Intel Advanced Micro Devices arm holding every one of those contains these chips in these chips are a bandwidth or a bridge to for actors to come in and get information out of your computer so then Intel says well I got a fix so it's they put a kind of a bandage over the over the bridge so hackers can get in and steal the information but that slows down the computer well if you just spent a couple grand on a computer is it is it significant oh yeah it so it slows the whole thing down enough to warrant you know 32 suits so you buy a computer it slows it down you have people getting their Information Act and so you have as you mentioned you have 32 lawsuits that fit into three categories so one is I bought I bought my computer and it's significantly slower with the fix then what what was advertised I didn't get what you sold me that's one number two is the derivative suit which the derivative suit is the company essentially suing the officers not directors right so it's a it's a derivative with the company stockholders shooting officers directly and the furqan terrible business decisions and the third one is a security soup about what I love which means that that they knew about the company knew about it didn't disclose it so people that bought stock paid inflated but here's what I love to see the CEO mica pronounce his last name correctly Brian it's Kresnik he sold eight hundred and eighty nine thousand shares on November as part of his plan he made thirty nine million dollars but while he knows this is overwhelming yeah he knew as of July 27th myself here Vick Brian crashed it he says Wow I got to keep this quiet while I keep it quiet I'm going to go ahead and sell stock and I'm I'm gonna make 39 million dollars well okay who got hit to understand you handled derivative suits vanillin for years a derivative suit is when the shareholder says that the conduct of management is so bad or it's so corrupt you've ruined life you've ruined the value of my stock right okay so what could have so this guy knows that his his stock is gonna tank if he doesn't secretly go do this as quickly as he can and if this information gets out then he's not gonna make 39 you know compensation system is what's wrong with with Wall Street in corporate America we pay our CEOs in large part most of their compensation comes from options in stocks which means I'm gonna give you stock that you can execute and buy a year or two down the line and the thought is their goal is aligned with a company get the stock price up well what it really ends up is and any means possible drive the stock price up as much as human impossible keep the bad news y-yeah while I sell my smile exercise my options and then liquidate so what he's done is he's any saying oh this is just part of a regular coincidence though something Bad's coming dude you can't sell your I mean well thirty nine million dollars which is more money than 99.99% of the population is ever gonna dream about making in a lifetime he sold in one liquidation in pocketed all the while knowing that his shareholders were about to get crushed and he sold it well you know the interesting thing about the point that you just made and this is so this is so important people don't understand that sit that used to be the CEO of a company would be with that company sometimes 2025 years okay now the new MBA ideas get out MBA school and get into what they call the NBA Network the CEO network what that means they're moving from one company to another within a period most of the time anywhere between three five years of the most okay so what happens what this thing Peter just talked about they build in this process now let's talk about a drug company for example a drug company ends up making what they call they they create a cash cow that's a drug that they're gonna sell to everybody it's going to make a lot of money but the CEO is already seeing the edge of a crisis he's seeing that oh yeah we're selling a lot of this drug but the problem is we know that it has potential to kill people right so what he does is he maximizes all of his interest in that company like this cat did make thirty nine million dollars he does that before the the story is out there that this drug has the ability to shut down your kidneys or this drug has the ability to shut down your liver he gets to see that information early on it's it's insider information but more importantly what he does is he's knows he's moving through the company but we've actually seen cases where the CEO does what they call this this quick sale he know he has a drug he's a drug that's gonna kill people he knows it's gonna kill people his scientists are gonna tell him is are telling he's gonna kill people so what he does is he's already looking for the second job during the time that he sells the stock so while the cash cow drug is making so much money happens every single day there's very few cases I've handled Peter where I haven't seen this happen it does in the culture to me it's what the problem if you push it back because obviously the sale of the stock is the problem it's part of the problem but if you push it back there's absolutely zero incentive to stop the drug that they know has a high probability of hurting people maybe they know what they told the FDA is inaccurate maybe they get updated information and all time they're thinking oh I got to keep this on the down-low right because I've got 150 million dollars in options and that goes to what you're saying this system continue to pay our CEOs based on these options down the line knowing that if they keep the information down they mean perpetrate fraud and that's what it is at the end of the day promotes fraud it does it's a whole system that says I need to maximize potential now not long-term value which is what it was not short term quick profits which also if you compare that to Wall Street and all the crazy crazy trading scams we have everybody knows that I'm gonna take home and put in my pocket short-term profits points from crazy risk the shareholders take the risk I get the reward but they even have a term for it and the term is big risk quick profits I mean we actually see it in memos where there's there's dialogue going between management and the CEO and say well you know to make big profits we got to take some quick risks some of the course and then they fester then they pass it on to the shareholders and then that maybe they get caught the company gets fine they don't pay it in money's good the CEO they'd seen you up at the same time has insurance for what he's done he's committed a crime he has killed people with a dangerous pharmaceutical that he knows is dangerous he's maximized his income while that's happening and he's out of the way he moved he's moved on to the teeth he's moved from Pfizer to Merck or former - you know Eli Lilly he's they're always moving and if you take a look at it you'll be amazed at how ugly this process the storyline that you've been you've been beating this drum for a long time if you would just hold one or two of these guys account or put a few sample doing a perp walk they thinking twice is cups on these weights or twice and you would see an end to this but instead I don't see this pattern repeated over and over and over in all kinds of different industries
