welcome back to KCDC i'm casey hunts we want to begin this hour with new revelations surrounding president Trump's picked to be the next CIA director Gina Haspel NBC News has learned that on Friday Haspel broached the idea of withdrawing her nomination her reasoning concerns that reopening the debate over brutal interrogations could damage the spy agency sources also tell NBC News that on Friday White House officials went to her office at CIA headquarters to encourage her to remain the nominee joining me this our NBC intelligence and national security reporter Kendall a nyan politics editor for The Daily Beast and MSNBC contributor Sam Stein former chief of staff at the CIA and Department of Defense Jeremy bash former CIA Acting Director John McLaughlin and from the White House NBC News White House correspondent Jeff Bennett thank you all for being here but Jeremy bash I want to start with you because as I understand it you just spoke a to Geena Haspel the nominee to be the director of the CIA what did she tell you she's going to full steam ahead she'll be at the hearing Wednesday morning she's not withdrawing her nomination she believes that her experience 33 years at the CIA mostly undercover seven overseas tours that she brings exactly the right kind of experience that the nation needs right now what was the concern that that prompt her to say hey if I need to withdraw I will I mean why it doesn't didn't she do damage to herself ahead of what was already gonna be a tough day maybe I think there's a there was concern I think she broached it that hey if we're gonna reopen some of the wounds from 2000 to 2003 when three individuals in US custody were waterboarded including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed who beheaded Daniel Pearl The Wall Street Journal reporter if we're gonna go back to those discussions go back to those debates that might harm CIA as an institution and I think in her mode of really putting the agency before herself she said if it's gonna harm CIA I don't need to be part of this but I think everyone around her said no you are the right person to do this the White House bucked her up and she's going full steam ahead Jeff Bennett what's the view from 1600 Pennsylvania right now on Haskell's nomination yeah well Casey I can tell you that the president and Gina Haspel spoke over the weekend sources who confirm the reporting first by The Washington Post tell us that the president has intentions to replace her as the nominee were also told that the White House officials who are helping her with this confirmation process they had won prep session today and they intend to have several more ahead of this Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Wednesday which as you well know is expected to be fairly contentious but already we've gotten a early sense of the White House strategy of taking shape around this nomination White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah put out a statement earlier today I'll read part of it for you he says this acting director Haspel is a highly qualified nominee who has dedicated over three decades of service to our country her nomination will not be derailed by partisan critics who side with the ACLU over the CIA on how to keep the American people safe and you can of course combine that with the tweet that White House press secretary Sarah sander sent over the weekend she called out Democrats who support women's support national security but yet who don't support hassles nomination you can see the tweet there that of course was viewed as a dig at California Senator Dianne Feinstein the Democrat who sits on the committee who was you know is facing a tough re-election bid in California and he was getting a lot of pressure from those on the Left to tank this nomination Casey Jeff thanks there is still of course a lot that we don't know about Gina hospitals background you may be just kind of meeting her for the first time so we want to take you inside here's Kendall Amiens inside look at why she's proven so controversial a veteran spies now emerging from the shadows Gena Haspel is so little known that some webpages have featured the wrong image for the last 15 months she's been the CIA's Deputy Director appearing occasionally in public it is my profound honor here giving a toast to a CIA legend but for years Sheeran covert operations in places like Ankara and Addis Ababa US intelligence officials tell NBC News she secretly helped capture two terrorists who bombed American embassies in Africa in 1998 she was once shot at by Iranians in an unnamed country they say she speaks Russian and has spied on the Russians CIA veterans of all political stripes say her background is perfect for the job that is what we do is recruit spies steal secrets and that makes her uniquely qualified to lead the mission but Haspel faces opposition in Congress over her role in a CIA program at a Senate investigation called torture after 9/11 she was sent to Thailand to run a secret CIA prison a black site on her watch CIA interrogators waterboarded a terror suspect three times a technique depicted in the movie zero dark thirty a few years later she sent a cable with an order issued by her boss to shred all the videotapes of those brutal CIA sessions Congress has now banned that kind of interrogation but during the 2016 campaign President Trump put torture back on the table don't tell me it doesn't work - what sure works okay folks officials say Haspel plans to tell senators that our confirmation hearing this week that she would resist if the President ordered the CIA to torture one former colleague says Haspel would be willing to stand up to the president she's got a spine of Steel I don't question that she can do that but that's not enough for some senators who are angry that the CIA has refused to declassify details of her work that's one of the big problems so we have great peace can thank you for that introduction let's I want to pick up on on one point that you made which is you know this president did go out on the campaign trail put torture kind of back on the table and I remember being at a Republican retreat I guess it was in 2017 and this was one area where Republican leaders were very quick to say we're not going back there this is not something that we want to do but it seems like the subject is going to be revisited at length on Wednesday it is and and my reporting is that she is going to say look we are not going to go down this road again it's against the law we learned our lessons from this and that may mollify many Democrats on the committee but it's not satisfying a lot of retired military officers for example including John McCain who was tortured in Vietnam who say look this is sending the wrong message to elevate somebody who participated in anyway and torture to be the head of the CIA and to be clear she wasn't an architect of this program but she was the head as I said in that piece she went to run a black site where a terrorist was waterboarded and that a lot of bad stuff was done to that guy after he left her custody but he's been examined by a psychiatrist who said he was one of the most damaged people that that man had ever looked at so this is a serious issue it questions are gonna be asked about and unfortunately she's not gonna be able to answer a lot of them because what she did including some of what I reported there it remains classified so she'll have to say I'm sorry senator we can talk about in closed session but not in the open here not in public John McLaughlin from the the broad perspective for the this agency that you know you have invested so much of your a career in is there danger here in hospice confirmation hearing I mean do you understand why she might have said hey if this is not something that we should revisit as a country I'd be better for the CIA if I didn't go forward well I'm glad she's going to appear but it's also true I understand why she might be reluctant the danger is that all of this will be reopened and the danger is that it's not really well understood you heard some of the things that Ken said it's very difficult to get at the facts of what actually happened during this period of time you also have to remind people that this was an extraordinary moment in the history of the country 3,000 people had died we had reliable reporting that there was a second wave attack planned bin Laden had met with nuclear scientists we had forensic evidence that al Qaeda had an anthrax program underway in Afghanistan we found that after we went in this is an extraordinary time and this program that everyone is focused on is not well understood it was not well examined in 2014 by the Senate that that report is very controversial among people involved in the program who look back at it and say all of that context is missing and it exaggerated s' a lot of the things that people think were were happening at that time and also I think you'll get into the whole issue of was this torture I never heard a single CIA officer say never do you think torture would work we didn't think of this is torture back then because the highest legal authorities in the country had said that it wasn't said it was torture the Senate report said it was torture and any reasonable person who reads what was done to some of these people I think might may well conclude that it was well but the CIA doesn't have to pick its lawyers well I mean I yeah I mean I think I think Kent's point is well-taken Sam Steinway in here the Bush office legal counsel went out to essentially justify this legally which was part of the problem I don't want to relitigate this I think part of the problem here is we're looking at in a weird frame to me there's keep them out of danger and reopening this debate about torture what exactly is the dinner isn't the dangers that we have never actually had this debate about what we did the dangers that we never actually went back and looked at it with clean sober eyes you say the report in 2014 was missing context well let's add context to it let's actually talk about this because our chapter in our history and I do think one of the air is that Barack Obama made in 2009 2010 was he said you know what I'm not gonna look back I'm gonna go forward and that has led us to a position where we are now where we are debating this still we don't have clear answers in the Jena hospital nomination has all the secrecy around it because we just won't fundamentally have a conversation but what we did actually I don't disagree that it's good to reopen it in that sense as long as we don't reopen it as a prosecutorial matter one of the things everyone forgets is that indeed why not you you balan you say nothing was done wrong this was all aboveboard legally the context is missing why not why not have that critical debate if you feel very firm that this is something that was justified why not just have that prospect I don't disagree with that I just think that everything should be on the table including for example that during the Obama administration a veteran prosecutor John Durham was asked to look at all of this he spent three years booing it he had access to all of the information about over a hundred detainees and he came away at the end of it and said no prosecutable offenses here 6,000 at page report had an exhaustive debate this happened 16 years ago her nomination is about her 33-year career working in every tough spot in the world mostly overseas mostly undercover she's the most qualified person who put up as a CIA director and as long as any of us can remember and more importantly I'll say this as a Democrat someone who served in Obama's administration at the CIA and the Defense Department and was Democratic chief counsel of the House Intelligence Committee reviewing the tapes destruction issue and other issues is that we want a career professional a nonpartisan person be running our intelligence agencies she's precisely the kind of person we want in the age of Trump we don't want a political crony we don't want someone who was a political or partisan pic we want someone who is it professional she's qualified she happens also to be the first woman that's not a reason to have her as director but it is an attribute and she is the most qualified person we put up so yes you can have a discussion about enhanced interrogation but boy we have had that before we go what do you what do you know or what and you may not be able to tell us much but the destruction of the tapes that the heart of the issue with Gina Haspel what is missing from our debate right now I investigated this issue when I was Democrat chief counsel she did not make the decision to to destroy the tapes in fact one correction can in your piece which was a terrific piece by the way but she did not send the cable to the field do it to destroy the tapes she drafted it it was sent by her boss and she believed her boss Jose Rodriguez was gonna get approval from the CIA director before he released that cable and Rodriguez did not get that approval so she was not too picked it on the tapes she did not make the decision so that's the the record we found that basically which on Durham found which is that no laws were violated and basically nothing was done incorrectly well if the debate here at this table is any indication of what we're gonna hear on Wednesday at this hearing I think that Jena hospital is in for a fiery hey there I'm Chris Hayes from
