1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
“What happens at
Georgetown Prep,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,180
stays at Georgetown Prep.”

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,820
This is how Judge
Brett Kavanaugh

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,000
described his high school days
and his college adventures.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,340
“What happens on the
bus, stays on the bus.”

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,030
But it’s a saying
you’ve probably heard before.

7
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:14,870
“What happens here—”

8
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:15,730
“What happens in Mexico—”

9
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,430
“What happened in Cairo—”

10
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,925
“What happens in accounting—”

11
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:19,565
“—stays at the Oscars, O.K.?”

12
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:23,550
Its meaning comes
from what it doesn’t say.

13
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,790
And more often than not,
it’s a nudge, nudge,

14
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,360
wink, wink to a boys' club
code of conduct.

15
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,820
“It continues to have a
male connotation

16
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,820
that men do things —
or at least talk about things —

17
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,630
when women are not around.”

18
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,415
“You know it’s right in
line with:

19
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:42,345
‘I don’t kiss and tell,’
‘Boys will be boys.’”

20
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:44,520
“It’s a linguistic strategy

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,790
that provides a ready-made 
practically nursery

22
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,660
rhyme-ready excuse for
men’s misbehaviors

23
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,460
that almost suggests before
the behaviors are even called out

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,250
that the behavior should
go without consequence.”

25
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,700
These days the phrase isn’t
used exclusively by men,

26
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,260
but linguists say
it likely emerged

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,180
in the second half
of the 20th century

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,470
in male-dominated spaces,
like sports clubs,

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
and rock bands.

30
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,080
It later became popular
among spring breakers.

31
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,670
“Dude says he’s going
to murder these other guys.”

32
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,380
Eventually, it
entered Americans'

33
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,790
everyday vocabulary,

34
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,410
when a self-proclaimed
Sin City

35
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,060
adopted it as its
official slogan.

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,260
“What happens in Vegas—”

37
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,220
“What happens in Vegas—”

38
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,155
“What happens in Vegas—”

39
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:32,925
“—stays in Vegas.”

40
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,430
“Within the logic
of this ad campaign,

41
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,640
not having a story
to share,

42
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,580
doesn’t mean you didn’t have
this extraordinary time.

43
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,100
It just means that
the story you do have

44
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,400
needs to be silenced because
of the social rules

45
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,900
that you had to break
to get it.”

46
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,790
“You gotta think of me
as your life coach.”

47
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,350
The phrase can
refer to anything

48
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,730
from drinking and partying—

49
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,870
“Listen to him.”

50
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,510
to lying and womanizing—

51
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,710
“I am a brain doctor.

52
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,460
I’m a lifeguard.

53
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,540
I’m a race car driver.”

54
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,430
“You told my friend
you’re a lawyer.”

55
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,230
to sexual experimentation —

56
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,910
“You gentlemen
ready to check in?”

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,820
or perhaps more
unspeakable things.

58
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,960
“Is this about Vegas?”
“Vegas?”

59
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,220
“You scared me for a second.”

60
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,390
But the connotation
stays the same.

61
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,880
Men behave badly when
their mothers or wives

62
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,607
aren’t looking.

63
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:28,940
It’s a trope of
masculinity that

64
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,750
runs deep, from fraternities
to Wall Street.

65
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,690
Being one of the guys takes
the ability and willingness

66
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,520
to keep secrets.

67
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,350
So while what happens
here stays here

68
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,690
has become a rallying
cry for wild weekends,

69
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,490
it also suggests that reckless
or aggressive behavior is O.K.,

70
00:02:46,490 --> 00:00:00,000
as long as men stick together.
