1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,440
This thing keeps happening every single time
I listen to one of my favorite songs of the

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,440
last 5 or so years.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:19,280
I hear this weird but familiar drum sound
that just cuts right through the track.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,200
I love it.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,860
Here it is one more time.

6
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:36,120
That punchy, unnatural drum was the sound
of the 80s and it’s back.

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:45,770
It's called gated reverb, and like many of
the greatest inventions, it was discovered

8
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,490
by accident.

9
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,040
In the 1970s, drums on the radio sounded a
lot like this

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,540
Host: They're quite dry aren't they?

11
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,110
They're just as recorded.

12
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:05,560
To achieve that isolated clean sound, producers
and engineers mic’d the drums all over,

13
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,560
including the inside.

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,840
This was the sound of bands like Pink Floyd,
Earth Wind and Fire, and Genesis.

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,650
At least up until 1979.

16
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,420
That’s when Peter Gabriel was recording
his third solo album.

17
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:23,590
His Genesis bandmate, Phil Collins, was on
the drums playing a simple beat.

18
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,970
And here's where something magical happened.

19
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,630
So, according to their engineer Hugh Padgham,
their engineer, they had a brand new recording

20
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:35,010
console with some cool features that included
a mic hanging in the studio to talk to the

21
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,010
band.

22
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:41,259
That mic accidentally picked up Phil’s drum
and the result was a thick punchy reverb that

23
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:47,800
disappeared in an instant.

24
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
The reason?

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,670
The mic had a heavy compressor on it.

26
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,730
Which reduces the volume of loud sounds and
amplifies quiet ones - it sort of crunches

27
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,340
a waveform.

28
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,220
And the console had a noise gate which only
lets amplitudes above a certain threshold

29
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,990
pass through and then it immediately shuts
off.

30
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:10,128
The result was such a crazy sound that Peter
Gabriel wrote his album opener, “Intruder”,

31
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:15,969
around it.

32
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:25,680
Now, if you don’t know “Intruder” you’ll
certainly recognize this - made by Phil Collins

33
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,650
and Hugh Padgham a year later.

34
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,900
"I can feel it coming in the air tonight,
oh

35
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,730
Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for

36
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,859
all my life, oh Lord"

37
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:38,859
Thanks

38
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,760
to a happy accident, the sound of

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,329
the 80s was born.

40
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,639
"I've been waiting for this moment for

41
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,969
all my life, oh Lord"

42
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:53,150
The drums on “In the Air Tonight” were
recorded in Townhouse’s legendary Stone

43
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,219
Room - its reverb came from the walls of the
studio.

44
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,439
It was meant to sound like a castle.

45
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:03,280
But not everyone who wanted good reverb had
access to that type of space.

46
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:11,309
In the '80s, once the digital technology came
to the fore not only was the sound of our

47
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:16,549
music changing, but the things that augment
our sounds were changing also.

48
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:21,199
Nothing illustrates this more than the evolution
of reverb.

49
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,469
Reverb was achieved in the early days the
most natural way of all, which is to have

50
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:28,329
an echo chamber.

51
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:32,980
You would set up in one corner of the room
a big loudspeaker and in the other corner

52
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,299
of the room, you'd set up a microphone.

53
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,499
Here’s an echo chamber at Abbey Road Studios.

54
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:42,930
Echo chambers took up real estate and real
estate was expensive so plate reverb was invented.

55
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,170
There'd be a big box with an aluminum plate
in it,

56
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,620
and the voice would go in one side, travel
along the aluminum plate, and come out the

57
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,199
other side with a little bit of reverberation
on it.

58
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,029
Plate reverb boxes were 600 pounds or more.

59
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:56,819
Not great for portability.

60
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:03,809
Enter the AMS RMX16, a shoebox sized unit
that created reverb via circuit boards and

61
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:05,219
algorithms.

62
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:12,889
Right there, in a box, we had plate reverbs
and underground garages and big concert halls

63
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:16,889
and small and large echo chambers, and music
clubs.

64
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:23,419
The AMS which debuted in 1982 was the first
reverb unit to be driven by a microprocessor

65
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:28,820
and it had room for 99 presets including a
few that that created that unnatural gated

66
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,939
sound with a push of a button.

67
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:34,940
I think a big example was the work that I
did with Prince in the 80s.

68
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,740
He loved that gated reverb.

69
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,050
Uh, yes, that Prince.

70
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,370
Prince used an Linn-LM1 drum machine that
sampled real drum sounds.

71
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:49,150
Susan fed that Linn-LM1 to the AMS reverb
box and used a preset called “nonlinear.”

72
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,349
Nonlinear reverb just can’t be replicated
in the real world without technology.

73
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:59,270
Reverb in a natural setting tends to fade
as the audio signal decays.

74
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,370
Nonlinear reverb actually gets louder.

75
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,610
It makes a drum sound like a whip.

76
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,990
Picture it like a tidal wave, a huge wave
suddenly stopping and hitting a brick wall.

77
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,050
That's the sound of gated reverb.

78
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,720
That was the classic, quintessential example.

79
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,250
That was the big one, that was the fat one.

80
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:24,560
"You don't have to be beautiful to turn me
on"

81
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,030
A year after “In the Air Tonight,” those
huge drums were no longer an accident, the

82
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,379
sound was built into reverb technology.

83
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:36,300
Then for a decade, gated reverb was a sound
you just couldn’t escape on the radio.

84
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,300
"It's in the trees!

85
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,300
It's coming!

86
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:45,100
When I was a child running in the night"

87
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,400
- drum fill -

88
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:59,919
"Oh, let it rock, let it roll"

89
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,319
We really kind of used it to death, and by
the next album, by Sign of the Times, I was

90
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,669
pretty sick of it.

91
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:07,580
It seemed everybody else was too.

92
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,020
When the 90s rolled around musicians favored
those dry drums again.

93
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,900
But here’s the thing.

94
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,910
After a about 20 year hiatus, It’s back.

95
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,910
"Hey!

96
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,419
When I needed!"

97
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:26,710
Here’s Ariel Rechtshaid on Song Exploder
he produced Carly Rae Jepsen’s latest album.

98
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:33,300
That drum fill is something that I always
just had in my head.

99
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,850
They were inspired by Jack & Diane by John
Cougar Mellencamp.

100
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,850
- Drum fill -

101
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:48,560
"I'm in love and you've got me, runaway"

102
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,250
Jack Antonoff of Bleachers was born the year
Prince released Purple Rain and here he is

103
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,659
in his studio playing that Linn-LM1 drum machine.

104
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:01,020
He produced Lorde’s latest album which has
gated drums.

105
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,020
"In your car the radio up.

106
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,389
In your car the radio up"

107
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:07,169
And Taylor Swift’s aptly titled 1989.

108
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:08,169
"It's 2am in your car"

109
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:15,650
The 
thing is, producers today don’t need Prince’s

110
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,110
drum machine or a physical rack of reverb
units to get that 80s sound.

111
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,811
You can go online and download massive Prince
and Phil Collins inspired gated reverb drum

112
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,419
sample packs.

113
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:28,530
And that AMS RMX 16?

114
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,259
It’s now a computer plug in.

115
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:33,759
Sure, gated reverb drums aren't a timeless
sound.

116
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,860
They bring you back to the 80s, but that doesn't
mean they don't sound cool.

117
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,389
This episode of Earworm is brought to you
by audible.com

118
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:45,490
If you go to audible.com there are so many
amazing books about music.

119
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:51,550
But there's one that I defintely want to recommend
and that's Listen to This by Alex Ross.

120
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,610
Alex Ross is a long time music critic at the
New Yorker and he's written some of my favorite

121
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,289
books about music.

122
00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:02,870
If you want to understand music more or appreciate
it better, Listen to This definitely has you

123
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,870
covered.

124
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:09,059

126
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,409
And if you choose not to keep the service,
you can still keep the book.

127
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,210
On other thing is I made a spotify playlist
for you.

128
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,660
The link is in the description.

129
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,270
It's called An Ode to Gated Reverb and it
has some of my favorite songs with gated reverb

130
00:08:22,270 --> 00:00:00,000
from the 1980s and today.
