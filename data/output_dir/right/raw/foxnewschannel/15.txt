WHAT A COUPLE OF DAYS THIS HAS

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,053
BEEN.

12
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:24,689
I CAN'T EVEN SAY A COUPLE OF

13
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:24,989
DAYS.

THESE SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES, IT

20
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:38,002

00:00:39,838 --> 00:00:43,007
ANOTHER ONE, SENATOR.

24
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,408
>> I THINK IT IS THE RESPONSIBLE

25
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:46,777
THING TO SAY FOR LEADERSHIP.

26
00:00:46,778 --> 00:00:48,846
IT IS HOW I FEEL.

27
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:49,580
I'M SORRY.

28
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:50,915
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO

29
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,984
THE CLINTONS AND THE OBAMA'S,

30
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:57,822
AND MR. GEORGE SOROS, AND NOW

31
00:00:57,823 --> 00:00:58,589
APPARENTLY VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN.

32
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,791
I AM SORRY FOR AMERICA.

33
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:02,994
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH

34
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:05,196
THIS.

35
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:08,199
THE FBI IS THE PREMIER

36
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,933
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

37
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:12,036
THEY WILL CATCH THIS PERSON.

38
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:13,204
MAYBE SOMEONE WHO IS MENTALLY

39
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:13,804
ILL.

40
00:01:13,805 --> 00:01:14,739
MAYBE SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT

41
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,041
MENTALLY ILL BUT IS JUST A WHACK

42
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:17,642
JOB.

43
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:18,376
I DON'T KNOW.

44
00:01:18,377 --> 00:01:21,245
IT IS TOO EARLY TO ASSESS.

45
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:23,514
I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME

46
00:01:23,515 --> 00:01:24,215
POLITICAL RHETORIC IN THIS

47
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:25,816
COUNTRY, IT HAS BEEN HOT ON BOTH

48
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:26,117
SIDES.

49
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:28,586
ON BOTH SIDES.

50
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:29,820
AS I CONTRIBUTE TO IT?

51
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:34,792
I DON'T THINK IT HAS HELPED.

52
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:35,693
PROBABLY WE ALL OUGHT TO DIAL IT

53
00:01:35,694 --> 00:01:38,996
DOWN A NOTCH.

54
00:01:38,997 --> 00:01:41,232
WHEN YOU ARE CIVIL, IT DOESN'T

55
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:43,000
MEAN YOU AGREE WITH YOUR

56
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:43,401
COLLEAGUES.

57
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:46,804
IT MEANS YOU RESPECT THEM.

58
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:48,205
AND I'M JUST SORRY THIS

59
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:48,639
HAPPENED.

60
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,807
THERE'S NOT MUCH ELSE YOU CAN

61
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:52,576
SAY, BUT I DO THINK WE WILL

62
00:01:52,577 --> 00:01:53,110
CATCH THIS PERSON.

63
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:56,280
>> Sandra: WHAT DO YOU THINK

64
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:57,682
OF JOHN BRENNAN FOR EXAMPLE?

65
00:01:57,683 --> 00:02:02,987
>> I WOULD SAY OF HIS INTERVIEW,

66
00:02:02,988 --> 00:02:05,122
IF YOU ARE GOING TO PLACE BLAME

67
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:07,458
ON THE POLITICAL CLIMATE IN THIS

68
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,126
COUNTRY IN MY JUDGMENT, THERE IS

69
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:12,163
ENOUGH BLAME TO GO AROUND.

70
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:14,699
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HOT

71
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,803
POLITICAL RHETORIC, YES, BUT SO

72
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:21,138
DOES -- WHAT'S, A MONTH AGO,

73
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:23,974
SECRETARY CLINTON SAID WE

74
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:24,608
SHOULDN'T BE CIVIL TO THE

75
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:27,244
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

76
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:28,813
I CAN REMEMBER A FAMOUS COMEDIAN

77
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:31,749
ON TELEVISION HOLDING THE FAKE

78
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,353
SEVERED HEAD OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.

79
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:36,187
I HAVE HEARD SOME OF MY

80
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:39,590
COLLEAGUES ON CAPITOL HILL

81
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:40,324
SCIENCE WHEN YOU SEE A

82
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:44,128
REPUBLICAN IN A RESTAURANT,

83
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:45,062
HARASS HIM OR HER.

84
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:47,631
>> Sandra: AND ALL OF THIS

HAPPENING TO MITCH McCONNELL

86
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,966
AND HIS WIFE.

87
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:52,603
>> I DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS

88
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:53,204
TIT-FOR-TAT.

89
00:02:53,205 --> 00:02:55,773
THERE RHETORIC IN OUR COUNTRY IS

90
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:56,040
HOT.

91
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,608
ALL SIDES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

92
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:58,976
IT.

93
00:02:58,977 --> 00:03:00,644
EVEN UNDER THE BEST OF

94
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:01,112
CIRCUMSTANCES --

00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:02,980

96
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:03,381
THE MOTIVE.

97
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:08,185
>> IT MAY WELL BE SOME WHACK

98
00:03:08,186 --> 00:03:08,452
JOB.

99
00:03:08,453 --> 00:03:12,723
IT COULD BE SOMEBODY WHO IS JUST

100
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:14,125
ANGRY AT OPPONENTS OF THE

101
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:14,492
