108
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:42,296
BUT FOR JUST AFRICAN-AMERICAN, LOOKING AT SOME OF THE TEXT

109
00:02:42,298 --> 00:02:43,331
LOOKING AT SOME OF THE TEXT MESSAGE, PEOPLE WERE APPALLED

110
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:44,799
MESSAGE, PEOPLE WERE APPALLED THAT KANYE WEST DID THIS.

111
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,401
THAT KANYE WEST DID THIS. BLACK PEOPLE ARE SMART ENOUGH TO

112
00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:47,902
BLACK PEOPLE ARE SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW JUST BECAUSE KANYE WEST IS

113
00:02:47,904 --> 00:02:48,937
KNOW JUST BECAUSE KANYE WEST IS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN, DOESN’T

114
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:50,672
AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN, DOESN’T MEAN YOU’RE GOING TO FOLLOW HIM

115
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:52,006
MEAN YOU’RE GOING TO FOLLOW HIM AND FOLLOW WHAT HE’S SAYING.

116
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:54,609
AND FOLLOW WHAT HE’S SAYING. YOU COULD SAY THAT AGAIN WITH

117
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,510
YOU COULD SAY THAT AGAIN WITH HERMAN KEAN.

118
00:02:55,511 --> 00:02:58,146
HERMAN KEAN. THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO SAID OKAY,

119
00:02:58,147 --> 00:02:59,447
THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO SAID OKAY, HERMAN KANE IS A BLACK MAN.

120
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:00,748
HERMAN KANE IS A BLACK MAN. THAT MEANS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

121
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,750
THAT MEANS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM.

122
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:02,851
VOTE FOR HIM. AND WE DIDN’T SEE THAT.

123
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:04,753
AND WE DIDN’T SEE THAT. I DON’T THINK THIS HELPS THE

124
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:05,520
I DON’T THINK THIS HELPS THE PRESIDENT WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN

125
00:03:05,554 --> 00:03:05,854
PRESIDENT WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS.

00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:07,756

UNCONVENTIONAL APPROACH OR DIFFERENT VOICE IN THE WHITE

129

DIFFERENT VOICE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

SPEECHLESS. >> I WILL -- IF I COULD SAY

00:04:12,922 --> 00:04:14,623
ONE -- REALLY QUICKLY. IT IS THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN

169
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:15,290
IT IS THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN CONSERVATIVES ARE VERY

170
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,024
CONSERVATIVES ARE VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THIS WHITE HOUSE

171
00:04:16,058 --> 00:04:17,392
FRUSTRATED WITH THIS WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE

172

BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE KANYE WEST SPEAKING FOR

173
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:20,129
KANYE WEST SPEAKING FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF BLACK

THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF BLACK REPUBLICANS WHO WOULD BE HAPPY

176
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,299
REPUBLICANS WHO WOULD BE HAPPY TO SIT WITH THE PRESIDENT, TALK

00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,241
BUT THE PRESIDENT ISN’T DOING THAT.

184
00:04:32,242 --> 00:04:33,542
THAT. INSTEAD, HE’S FILLING THE WHITE

185
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:37,146
INSTEAD, HE’S FILLING THE WHITE HOUSE WITH OMAROSA, WITH KANYE

00:04:37,147 --> 00:04:39,448
HOUSE WITH OMAROSA, WITH KANYE WEST, WITH PEOPLE WHO BLACK

WEST, WITH PEOPLE WHO BLACK REPUBLICANS SAY DON’T REPRESENT

188
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:41,150
REPUBLICANS SAY DON’T REPRESENT THEIR NEEDS.

189
00:04:41,151 --> 00:04:42,518
THEIR NEEDS. >> IF THERE WERE A REAL EFFORT

190
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,321
>> IF THERE WERE A REAL EFFORT TO SPEAK TO BLACK REPUBLICANS

191
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:46,822
TO SPEAK TO BLACK REPUBLICANS AND/OR BLACK CONSERVATIVES,

00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:55,030
BUT THEY HOLD CONSERVATIVE VIEWS.

196
00:04:55,032 --> 00:04:56,132
VIEWS. WHAT WOULD THAT HAVE LOOKED

197
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:56,432
WHAT WOULD THAT HAVE LOOKED LIKE?

198
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:57,967
LIKE? THE PRESIDENT TRYING TO SALEM

00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:59,302
THE PRESIDENT TRYING TO SALEM APPEAL TO MORE AFRICAN-AMERICANS

00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,273
>> I THINK THAT CONVERSATION WOULD LOOK LIKE LET’S TALK ABOUT

00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:05,040
WOULD LOOK LIKE LET’S TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY.

204
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:06,676
THE ECONOMY. LET’S TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

205
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,443
LET’S TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT AFRICAN-AMERICAN EMPLOYMENT IS

206
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:09,378
AFRICAN-AMERICAN EMPLOYMENT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS HELPED NOT

207
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:10,946
SOMETHING THAT HAS HELPED NOT JUST IN NUMBERS BUT HAS HELPED

208
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:11,781
JUST IN NUMBERS BUT HAS HELPED SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES.

209
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:13,049
SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES. LET’S TALK ABOUT THOSE CITIES

210
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,783
LET’S TALK ABOUT THOSE CITIES LIKE DETROIT.

211
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:14,517
LIKE DETROIT. MAYBE LIKE CHICAGO.

212
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:15,985
MAYBE LIKE CHICAGO. NOT IN A WAY TO SAY THAT THESE

213
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,887
NOT IN A WAY TO SAY THAT THESE ARE PLACES WHERE DEMOCRATS HAVE

214
00:05:17,888 --> 00:05:20,223
ARE PLACES WHERE DEMOCRATS HAVE FAILED BUT SAY LET’S LOOK AT THE

215
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:21,891
FAILED BUT SAY LET’S LOOK AT THE POSITIVE PLANS WE HAVE FOR THESE

216
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:22,225
POSITIVE PLANS WE HAVE FOR THESE CITIES.

217
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:23,993
CITIES. IT WOULD REALLY SALEM LOOK AT MY

218
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:24,293

00:05:24,328 --> 00:05:25,628
CABINET. I WANT TO HAVE MORE

I WANT TO HAVE MORE AFRICAN-AMERICANS EMPLOYED AT

AFRICAN-AMERICANS EMPLOYED AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

222
00:05:26,897 --> 00:05:28,698
THE WHITE HOUSE. WHICH MEANS IT’S NOT JUST

223
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:29,766
WHICH MEANS IT’S NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT ADVERSITY.

224
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:31,100
TALKING ABOUT ADVERSITY. IT’S INCLUDING PEOPLE OF COLOR

225
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:31,701
IT’S INCLUDING PEOPLE OF COLOR IN YOUR WHITE HOUSE.

226
00:05:31,735 --> 00:05:33,503
IN YOUR WHITE HOUSE. THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT DONE THAT.

227
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:35,372
THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT DONE THAT. >> YES, THERE WAS SOME -- IT

230
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:39,208
CONVERSATION SEEMED TO VEER FOR MOMENTS DOWN THAT ROAD.

231
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:43,546
MOMENTS DOWN THAT ROAD. THERE WAS A CONVERSATION OF KIM

232
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,681
THERE WAS A CONVERSATION OF KIM KARDASHIAN AND ALICE JOHNSON WHO

233
00:05:45,683 --> 00:05:47,217
KARDASHIAN AND ALICE JOHNSON WHO HAD BEEN RELEASED FROM PRISON

00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:53,223
NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSE AND KANYE TALKED ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO

00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:54,724
KANYE TALKED ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO HE SAID WAS SENTENCED FOR TOO

238
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:55,024
HE SAID WAS SENTENCED FOR TOO LONG.

239
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:56,826
LONG. THEY TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

240
00:05:56,827 --> 00:05:58,194
THEY TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO AND

241
00:05:58,195 --> 00:06:01,931
URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO AND BRINGING JOBS IN.

242
00:06:01,932 --> 00:06:05,535
BRINGING JOBS IN. SO THEN IT WENT OFF THE RAILS.

243
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:06,169
SO THEN IT WENT OFF THE RAILS. >> WANTS TO TAKE THIS

244
00:06:06,203 --> 00:06:07,103
>> WANTS TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT STOP

245
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:09,939
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT STOP AND FRISK TO THE PRESIDENT.

246
00:06:09,974 --> 00:06:10,506
AND FRISK TO THE PRESIDENT. KANYE DOESN’T LIKE IT.

247
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,207
KANYE DOESN’T LIKE IT. THE PRESIDENT ARTICULATED

248
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,008
THE PRESIDENT ARTICULATED EARLIER THIS WEEK HE DOES.

249
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:14,043
EARLIER THIS WEEK HE DOES. I JUST WONDER HOW MUCH THE

250
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:15,111
I JUST WONDER HOW MUCH THE PRESIDENT LISTENED TO AND WHAT

251
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:16,713
PRESIDENT LISTENED TO AND WHAT HIS TAKEAWAY WILL BE.

252
00:06:16,714 --> 00:06:20,116
HIS TAKEAWAY WILL BE. KANYE WAS TALKING ABOUT GREAT

KANYE WAS TALKING ABOUT GREAT COMPANIES OR BRANDS.

254
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:22,152
COMPANIES OR BRANDS. TALKING ABOUT LEVI’S.

255
00:06:22,153 --> 00:06:23,453
TALKING ABOUT LEVI’S. LEVI’S HAS TAKEN A STAND AGAINST

256
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:28,024
LEVI’S HAS TAKEN A STAND AGAINST TRUMP POLICIES ON GUN CONTROL,

257
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:29,759
TRUMP POLICIES ON GUN CONTROL, ON LGBTQ.

258
00:06:29,794 --> 00:00:00,000
ON LGBTQ. LEVI’S, THAT’S CERTAINLY NOT IN
