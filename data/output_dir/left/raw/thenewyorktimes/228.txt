1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
For over a half century,
Cuba and the Castros

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,770
have gone hand in hand.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,000
Often clad in green military fatigues,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,760
Fidel ruled the island
nation as a dictator,

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,430
squashing dissent and
confronting a superpower

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,120
just 90 miles away in America.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,420
Now, in a historic
power shift,

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,540
a new face is assuming
power in Cuba.

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,200
His name is Miguel Díaz-Canel
and he’s been lurking

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,590
in the background, standing
shoulder to shoulder

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,090
with Fidel and
his brother Raúl,

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,700
and yet all the
while, he was slowly

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,790
moving up the ranks,
becoming the country’s

14
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,320
vice president in 2013.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,080
It’s the first time a non-Castro
will be president

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,030
in more than 40 years.

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,310
He takes over from
Raúl, who succeeded

18
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,800
his older brother in 2008.

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,720
It’s also the first
time that someone

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,080
who wasn’t part of the
revolution takes the reins.

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,810
Raúl Castro had put in
place rules that limit

22
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,450
a president to two five-year terms.

23
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,640
And he’s lived up to that.

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,360
But Castro is not
exactly disappearing.

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,700
He will continue to head
the Communist Party,

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,210
arguably the most powerful
political post in Cuba.

27
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,170
So this is a slow
changing of the guard.

28
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,320
But it signals a
huge shift in how

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,310
Cuba will operate,
politically and economically.

30
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,200
Unlike the Castros, who
established their legitimacy

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,100
through the
communist revolution,

32
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,720
Díaz-Canel will have
to cement his role

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,830
by delivering on some
much-needed reforms,

34
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,560
including fixing the island’s
two-currency system.

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,530
As it stands, there’s both
a national currency

36
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,730
and another one
pegged to the U.S. dollar,

37
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,280
effectively barring
parts of the population

38
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,850
from purchasing
certain basic goods

39
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,355
and from actively participating
in the larger economy.

40
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,760
Díaz-Canel also needs to
cultivate more opportunities

41
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,130
for the country’s restive youth.

42
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,030
“I hope that the line that
Raúl Castro established

43
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,790
a few years ago can be
steadily improving and

44
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,500
more businesses, more
licenses, that’s what I hope.”

45
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,980
Díaz-Canel is likely to maintain
Cuba’s ties with Russia and China

46
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,170
as relations with the U.S. 
continue to sour.

47
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,520
He has also said that he plans to 
expand access to the internet.

48
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,480
But on the question of
human rights, like censorship,

49
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,930
Cuba’s tight grip is likely
to take longer to loosen.

50
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,560
So just how did Díaz-Canel
emerge in a country

51
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,520
whose rulers have had
an iron grip on power?

52
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,310
He grew up 170 miles east
of Havana, in Santa Clara,

53
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,620
where he worked as an
engineering professor

54
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,220
and a local Communist Party leader.

55
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,310
From there, he went on to become
the youngest-ever member,

56
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,770
at 43 years old,
of the Politburo,

57
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,710
the most powerful body
within the Communist Party.

58
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,160
He was appointed minister
of higher education in 2009

59
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,620
and was handpicked to be
vice president in 2013.

60
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,350
Experts say he rose by
keeping a low profile

61
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,260
and toeing the country’s line.

62
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,160
And with Raúl keeping
close watch over his rule,

63
00:03:43,160 --> 00:00:00,000
any change will
likely come slow.
