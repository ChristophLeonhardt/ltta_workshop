MSNBC anchor man Brian Williams has launched an on-air attack against fake news Hayes little satires cracked me up there so funny oh wait this really happened Williams told his audience that he's done extensive reporting on the fake news issue while heading an MSNBC investigative team made up of an explosives expert a black computer hacker a midget Acrobat and an alluring femme fatale Williams says his team trailed a group of conservatives to an abandoned warehouse in the waterfront district of Gotham City they're using the elaborate skills he acquired as a jewel thief in Monte Carlo Williams says he managed to break into the warehouse unnoticed and hang upside down from the ceiling in one of those wire contraptions Tom Cruise used in the first Mission Impossible movie or possibly the second they all sort of blend together Williams went on to tell MSNBC viewers that he witnessed a group of conservatives performing bizarre hypnosis experiments on left wing virgins in order to convince them to seduce Russian agents of Vladimir Putin to hack into DNC computers and skew the results of the election by releasing a quote cheese pizza unquote which is dark web slang for a flat round piece of baked bread dough topped with spicy tomato sauce and melted mozzarella which is apparently impossible for American voters to resist Williams managed to break this story before he was kidnapped by conservative thugs and beaten to a lying sack of pulp another crusader against fake news is Hillary Clinton the former something or other I can't remember now what she did mrs. Clinton says fake news is being generated by the same vast right-wing conspiracy that tried to convince her her husband had been serially unfaithful with an uncountable number of young warm vivacious sexually welcoming women because he couldn't stand the sight of the ice maiden he married purely for political purposes mrs. Clinton says she discovered this fake news conspiracy after flying into Bosnia under sniper fire where she found a videomaker manufacturing anti-islamic YouTube videos that caused a riot to erupt in Benghazi Libya leaving four Americans dead through absolutely no fault of hers or President Obama's mrs. Clinton said she would be as diligent in exposing fake news stories as she had been in releasing the government emails that somehow found their way into a private server along with the 57,000 emails about yoga which you don't need to see so she deleted them then washed out the inside of her computer with acid and then killed anyone who might have read them previously former something-or-other Clinton said she would continue her fight against fake news in her new position as the feminist conscience of the nation a position conferred upon her by an international gathering of the most powerful op-ed writers at the New York Times like mrs. Clinton the New York Times also used to be something but I can't remember now what it was trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Clavin show is to give you there's a wind also same

do want to say first just over the weekend over the cleveland this weekend the my memoir the great good thing it called a cultural secular Jew comes to faith in christ the great good thing was named by two different people as their books of the year both yeah in the Wall Street Journal they asked all these famous people who what books they liked and Mike Duran the accomplished historian I think he's from the Hudson it's Institute he named the great good thing went on at length about it which was very nice and John Lewis Christianity today very good book critic Christianity today put me on his top list of the year you can get that book and while you're there you can pick up my novel werewolf cop for only a buck 99 on kindle if you live in the United States some people have been complaining that they're not in the United States but if you're not in the United States you should complain all right before we talk about anything else to talk about I have to talk about John Glenn this was the the worst thing about the Clavin this weekend was the death of John Glenn means 95 whose time but that's that's another thing altogether normally you go into the top news of the day and get to these things last but John Glenn was so important certainly in my life and in the cultural imagination of my generation that I thought I just I just to mention one thing about him when I was a kid John Glenn obviously the great astronaut one of the first of them of the mercury seven he was the first man the fifth man in space and the first man to orbit the Earth here is the famous play the famous moment when he took off this is the famous moment go all three star power lights are correct there any light is on he checked the umbilical I'll evacuate portree umbilical clear oh it's lights on re quarters too fast d minus 18 seconds and counting engine start either way with serious trauma good Lauren ride all the ways you've got speed John Glenn just a really moving moment he Glenn joked that he was sitting on millions of dollars of equipment made by the lowest bidder he was a he was a combat he flew over a hundred combat missions in World War two and korea won the Distinguished Flying Cross 6 x games a u.s. senator obviously and then the oldest man in space when he went back up on the shuttle in 1998 when i was a kid and that that when that was being played i was eight years old when i was a kid there were three men who represented what an American man was to me which was very important because if you read my memoir you'll see I didn't have a lot of male role models that I could appreciate and I needed people to guide me I looked in literature and I'll obviously looked in pop culture and the three were Mickey Mantle who was the senator great center fielder for the New York Yankees John F Kennedy who was the president so we all admire him enormously and John Glenn who was the hero of the age I mean he was just you know beyond imagining it's it's it's impossible to describe what a great hero he was and of course as I got older and the news media started to tell more of the truth about people's lives it turned out that both JFK and Mickey Mantle were not what they were cut out to be I mean JFK was a philanderer and very very sinister in some ways politician I'm not saying he was the worst president ever he wasn't that he's the worst president ever is about to leave office but JFK was you know he was not a good guy he was not a good person and and uh and certainly Mickey Mantle who probably was a nice person was a terrible drunk he said very movingly before he died when it came down with liver cancer he said you talk about being a role model I'm a role model don't do what I did I mean so he was so these way John Glenn was who he seemed to be and that doesn't mean he was perfect you know the press likes to make us think that if a guy isn't perfect he's terrible you know it has nothing to do with being perfect but he was a great hero if you read Tom Wolfe's the right stuff he was the epitome of the right stuff a guy whose heart beat didn't even speed up when he was launched into space he was married to the woman he met in his crib virtually I think she was two years old when he married annie my favorite story about him is that Annie had famously had this terrible terrible stutter she could barely speak and when Lyndon Johnson then the vice president wanted to meet with her in front of the camera she panics she said she couldn't do it and John Glenn basically told the vice president to get stuff that he said like he said they aren't he said Annie if you don't want the vice president in your house he is not coming in the house and the story that I just love about her it was apparently one of the great marriages and she in the 70s I think maybe the 80s they developed a new technique for improving stutters and she went into this program and she came back and she was able to speak better and she said she said to John Glenn there's something I've been wanting to tell you for years pick up your socks that is if my wife was kept silent for years that would be the first thing she said to me too anyway a great hero when here you know when people are what they seem to be when heroes are what they seem to be you would think that people would love this but they don't you know one of the reasons I saw John Glenn in person when he was running for president and he was boring you know he was not like it because he was a real person people want to know that their heroes have feet of clay they would much rather adore and worship some rock star slag because she doesn't hold them up to any standard higher than their own they would next time they get drunk and wake up with somebody that they don't know they can say well you know Madonna does it so it's okay with me when you have a real hero like George Washington or John Glenn and they really live up to those things it basically says to you can be better and nobody wants to hear that and nobody wants to hear that they can actually be who they pretend they are they would much rather be who they you know can laugh about with their friends and while they destroy their and other people's lives great but great men call us to a new level John Glenn did that Godspeed glint John Glenn oh sorry to see him go all right the democrat national committee has released their newest assessment of why hillary clinton lost to Donald Trump here it is I really guess I had a flat tire I ain't have money for cab fare my tush didn't come back to the cleaners I don't friend came in from out of town someone stole my car there was an earthquake a terrible flood it was Lopez it was he my walk this is insane you know this is it Scott it's commis fault from the FBI it's this it's as the electoral college so now there's this new story from starting the Washington Post The New York Times echoes it today the CIA which had already been a you gotta be kept to understand what the story is the CIA which had already reported to Obama and senators and other people that the Russians had hacked had some role in hacking the DNC and releasing all these emails that made John Podesta and the Clinton campaign look bad because of they were bad that they now an anonymous source is telling the Washington Post an anonymous intelligence source is telling the Washington Post and The New York Times that Putin's aim the Russians a min this was getting Donald Trump elected this story is crap this story is one hundred percent crap now I don't even know I'm sure it's true i'm sure some senior official did say this but who cares i mean it is a story it was definitely a story when they said we think the Russians are hacking the DNC and trying to mess with the American elections that an anonymous source will not come forward but says we now know what their motive was how the hell do they know what their motive was plus plus the new york times reports that this anonymous saw tells them that the rnc was also hacked but they didn't release that information whereas the RNC says we had the FBI in here to explore our computers and they were not act at all so the source is already questionable this story is crap one of the things I think they're aiming at eyes I really do think that they're aiming a little bit at the electoral college hoping some of these electors or faithless electors which by the way we put the send the country up in smoke if this somehow the Electoral College turn this election around and they thought if they think that Hillary Clinton is going to be installed by a deus ex machina that's not going to happen now listen again it's it's important if the Russians are hacking computers we want to know about it i'm not saying that but this story this particular story is crap and i have to say and of course the first let's take it from the Democratic talking points of view the Democrats are calling for an investigation Claire McCaskill was the spokeswoman this should be not only about protecting us going forward but this is a form of warfare for Vladimir Putin who is a thug and a bully and has the friends around the globe that we don't want to be friends with for him to be trying to impact our elections that we have to there has to be has to be held accountable and that's why this has to well that's that's some of that's classified I believe and I don't think it's something that we can discuss on TV but I've had briefings just this last week that indicate that this is a very serious issue for the American people to understand and for Donald Trump to dismiss out of hand the intelligence community's fact-gathering is frankly doesn't bode well for him protecting our country I think he needs to not immediately react and wait until he gets all the facts so the irony here is endless I want to say of course John McCain and Lindsey Graham the two most useful idiots in the Senate you know the Democrat useful idiots immediately said yes we need a bipartisan investigation of that you know it's like it is walking into this thing and of course you have to investigate the Russian involvement but you know the idea of the Democrats who have been cozying up they've been they have been run blind Vladimir Putin has run circles around Barack Obama he has made him look like a child let's not go back to the Russian we don't even have to talk about the Russian reset or remember Obama getting caught on the hot mic saying tell Vladimir I'll have more flexibility after I I get reelected and all this stuff you know it and all of the first of all and the other thing is the CIA is basically accusing the Russians of doing the media's job for them they're getting the news that the media wouldn't get but you know the other thing is the sudden confidence in our CIA and our intelligence service who are the ones as Trump was quick to point out who are the ones who told us that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction you know these these are also theirs is the wall street journal let me read just one quick paragraph from The Wall Street Journal if the CIA really does have high confidence about mr. Putin's motives how they would know that I don't know but this would also be the first time in recent history these are the same seers who missed the Russian invasion of Crimea missed the incursion into southern Ukraine and missed mr. Putin's foray into Syria the intelligence community also claimed high confidence in 2008 for its judgment that Iran had suspended its nuclear weapons program that judgment conveniently shut down any further Bush administration action against Iran but a year later in the Obama administration are highly confident spooks disclosed Iran's secret photo underground facility so I mean you know it's like they what they do what they do with Trump now well let's let's listen to Trump's reaction Trump just blew this off in a very refreshing way as far as I'm concerned I think it's ridiculous i think it's just another excuse I don't believe it I don't know why and I think it's just you know they talked about all sorts of things every week it's another excuse we had a massive landslide victory as you know in the electoral college I guess the final numbers are now at 30 sixth and she's you know down to a very low number no I don't believe that at all you say you don't know why do you think that the CIA is trying to overturn the result no your life as Sarah's on how to to weaken you in office well if you look at the story and you take a look at what they said there's great confusion nobody really knows and hacking is very interesting once they hack if you don't catch them in the act you're not going to catch him they have no idea of its Russia or China or somebody it could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace all right is he getting oranger I did you look like he's getting actually oranger to me all right we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but but our golden globe-winning cultural correspondent Michael Knowles is coming on so you might want to come over the daily wire and listen to the rest if you subscribe you can watch the whole thing on the website which is a joy untold plus you can be in our mail bag so come on over
