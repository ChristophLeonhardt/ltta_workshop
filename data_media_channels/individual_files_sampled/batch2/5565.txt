every other country still in the agreement including Russia and China say they want to save the deal what does that mean for the United States I mean Russia having more diplomatic ties to these other countries than we do well more so even than Russia and China you've got the potential of the United States would we punish countries like the UK France and Germany that still continued to trade with Iran that's going to put us in a really perilous position with our closest allies if we're looking to really reimpose these sanctions I would also point out a marked contrast with how quickly the Trump administration proposes reinstating sanctions on Iran versus congressionally mandated sanctions on Russia but hey those that's our foreign policy these days John President Obama issued a very rare public statement and I want to share part of it he writes in a democracy there will always be changes in policies and priorities from one administration to the next but the consistent flouting of agreements that our country is a party to risks eroding America's credibility and puts us at odds with the world's major powers unusual for an immediate predecessor to be as blunt and straightforward extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures I think President Obama should say that I think George W Bush gave a very good speech a couple of months ago about not building walls and and returning to isolationism do you agree with the sentiment oh absolutely the elections have consequences unquestionably and Trump campaigned on this I'm still unclear by whether he knows what's in the deal but or what percentage of Americans could tell you one part of this deal that's now going to be talked about for this period and I think that's a danger is a complicated piece of diplomacy that involves the most fundamental issue which is a weapon that can wipe out massive swathes of human life and yet it was put in this populist frame last year as an applause line as an anti Obama anti internationalist almost Breitbart view and I think what President Obama is articulating there is a view of what we would think of as the post-world War two foreign policy establishment that helped us win the Cold War Ronald Reagan wasn't the only person you know it was Democrats and Republicans Truman as a Democrat put in the structures you know we went from daytime to a little more hawkish and back and forth but ultimately that was a bipartisan victory and our greatest foreign policy hours have come when it's been bipartisan it's not a gross assumption to say Trump doesn't know what's in the Iran deal he didn't know what was in TPP he doesn't know how Obamacare works he doesn't know what was in the tax bill he doesn't know what was in the massive budget that he signed and he now regrets but he's going to quickly find out what some of the consequences could be at home gas prices going up CNBC is reporting that Boeing could lose twenty billion dollars in aircraft deals could that impact President Trump and Republicans come to midterms absolutely absolutely we're already preparing for a blue wave the summer's here people are going to get in their cars and if gas prices spike as they typically do he's going to feel the effect the Republican Party will affiliate feel the effect let's be clear here he's gonna embolden hardliners in Iran he stepped into the mess that is the the conflict between Shia and Sunni he's he's tried to rearrange some things in this region that is already volatile and the likelihood of war has just been increased in the region and I just want to say this for 17 years I've had to raise a child in a world full of war I'm just tired of death and to have someone who doesn't have the patience the mental acumen or the curiosity but on a document it's not president Trump's fault that you've been raising a child no this is his team this is at a time of war he's been pregnant for the last year and I've been critical over these last 17 years Americans we have seen we seem to have become oh we were okay with people dying the sad thing is we forget about it millions of people have died point that was what President Trump campaigned on that he was going to have a less interventionist less hawkish foreign policy and is how did what he did yesterday with Iran make the world a safer place how does that reduce the likelihood of greater conflict in the Middle East and I don't think it does and you combine that with hubris as if there are no other actors in the world you just make this decision as folk art whether we dislike the original nuclear deal and think that President Obama should have done more to bring Congress in to have congressional approval of it you can say that it should have dealt with the ballistic missile problem but at the end of the day the bad deal was all we had and that he had opportunities to he had leverage he would have moments where his threats would create leverage and he could have dealt with our European partners to create some kind of side deal and make the deal tougher they were open to instead of just his empty threats and leaving it with nothing remaining I mean thinking about because this is what we think about Winston Churchill this week that's what you think I definitely was not I love that you were there's VE Day right and so it's the greatest achievement and on the 10th of May is the anniversary of Churchill becoming Prime Minister and he gave a speech at Harvard September 1943 where he said you know Americans want the long arm of the world has reached out and brought Americans out into complexity and into struggle into war and you might say well you don't want it you want to stay over here but the price of greatness is responsibility and we can't roll that back we can't build a wall we can't withdraw from agreements that are about stabilizing a world that has grown ever smaller and is only gonna get smaller hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks
