while you're young I encourage people to
get a degree in a subject that enables
you to read the most books forget about
a career centric degree get a degree in
literature history or philosophy where
you're gonna read the most books because
once college is over that's the thing
you'll miss the most is the time to read
I'm so upset that I don't get to read as
much as I do I read on planes and I
don't fly as much as I used to because I
got married again and I got kids but you
can read and to travel more around the
world while you're young do the things
you could only do when you're young
because they take my word for I'm 58
years old I don't get to read I don't
get to travel
