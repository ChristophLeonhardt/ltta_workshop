1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,080
when it comes to football I prefer

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,170
college football over the NFL I'm a

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,660
die-hard Alabama fan and some have

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,610
argued that Alabama is basically an

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,040
nfl-caliber team but that's a different

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,910
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> ro Todd but everybody loves the</font>

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,250
NFL last year's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Super Bowl ranks is the</font>

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">most-watched television broadcast of all</font>

9
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,410
time with a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 11.5 million</font>

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,660
viewers then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fantasy</font>

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,480
football Crais which keeps 33 million

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,549
people glued to their phones every week

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,010
but my big<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with the NFL is the</font>

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,870
fact that I can only watch five or six

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the 16 games that are played every</font>

16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,530
week this is due to the league's

17
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,989
complicated and highly lucrative deals

18
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,969
it has with a handful<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> broadcast</font>

19
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:46,890
networks and cable companies you're

20
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,140
probably thinking just get DIRECTV which

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,579
has sunday ticket where you can watch

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,890
all the games I would if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could but my</font>

25
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,440
if it was I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's pretty lame that</font>

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,329
DirecTV reportedly doesn't even work

27
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,480
when it's raining but directv just

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,400
extended its deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the NFL to be the</font>

eight years DirecTV will pay the NFL

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,720
about 1.5 billion dollars a year for

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,610
this but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are only around 20</font>

various regions of the u.s. on Sunday

40
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,840

you can only watch those teams

regardless of whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there are</font>

44
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,700
better games on at the same time I could

subscribe to<font color="#CCCCCC"> DIRECTV's digital version</font>

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,720
of the sunday ticket which means for

47

three hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and thirty dollars a year</font>

48
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,990
I can stream all the NFL games on my

54
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,579
then for audio I'd have to get an aux

55
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,380
cable and connect that to my bose

56
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,759

there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> doubt about it the current</font>

73
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,510
college football TV deals cater to more
