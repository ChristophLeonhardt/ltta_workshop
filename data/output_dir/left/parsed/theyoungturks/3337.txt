SAUDI ARABIA HAS BEEN ROILED
WITH CONFLICT OVER THE PAST TWO
DAYS OF BOTH DOMESTIC AND
INTERNATIONAL SORTS.
YOU HAVE
THIS INTERNAL POWER STRUGGLE
WHERE POWERFUL, WEALTHY PEOPLE
INSIDE SAUDI ARABIA HAVE BEEN
ROUNDED UP, THEN YOU ALSO HAVE
AN INCREASING IN THEIR ONGOING
WAR WITH YEMEN, WHERE OVER THE
WEEKEND A BALLISTIC MISSILE WAS
FIRED INSIDE OF YEMEN TARGETING
AN AIRPORT NEAR THE CAPITAL OF
SAUDI ARABIA, SOMETHING THAT HAD
NOT YET HAPPENED IN THIS
CONFLICT, THE MISSILE WAS SHOT
DOWN, BUT IN RESPONSE SAUDI
ARABIA LAUNCHED WHAT HAS BEEN
PITCHED AS, OR REPORTERS ARE
SAYING, IS THE BIGGEST, MOST
DAMAGING ROUND OF AIRSTRIKES IN
ANY ONE PERIOD SINCE THE
CONFLICT BEGAN.
THIS IS A
CONFLICT THAT HAS ALREADY KILLED
MORE THAN 10,000 CIVILIANS, SOME
ARE SAYING OVER 13,000, IT HAS
DESTROYED SO MUCH INFRASTRUCTURE
THAT 7 MILLION PEOPLE ON THE
BRINK OF FAMINE, AND YEMEN HAS
BEEN THE SITE OF SOME OF THE
WORST CHOLERA OUTBREAKS IN
RECENT WORLD HISTORY, WHICH THIS
IS NOT THE SORT OF HISTORY YOU
WANT TO BE MAKING.
UNDERSTAND
THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS
MULTIPLE TIMES, THIS IS A
CONFLICT THAT THE U.S. HAS BEEN
AIDING THE SAUDI COALITION ON BY
REFUELING THEIR PLANES,
PROVIDING INTELLIGENCE AND
LOGISTICS, SO THIS ISN'T
SOMETHING WE ARE INNOCENT ON,
THANKS TO DONALD TRUMP'S
EXTREMELY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT, ALEX
JONES CAN'T EXPLAIN IT,
HE'S A BIG FAN OF THEM.
THAT CONTINUED YESTERDAY WITH
HIM SAYING --
THAT IS NOT A REFERENCE TO
THE WAR, THAT'S A REFERENCE TO
THE MESS THAT CONFLICT, AND HERE
IS HOW THAT HAS LOOKED --
THAT IS A 100,000 SOLDIER
STRONG UNIT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO
PROTECT THE ROYAL FAMILY -- DAMN
THEY HAVE A LOT OF BODYGUARDS --
THE LEADERSHIP OF THAT WAS
TURNED AROUND, AND THERE WAS A
GREATER PURGE --
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
STILL ALIVE, TWO PRINCES WERE
KILLED --
THAT IS A THING THAT COULD
HAPPEN, CERTAINLY -- IT'S ALSO
SUSPICIOUSLY TIMED, ALTHOUGH
MAYBE WE WILL FIND OUT MORE IN
THE FUTURE.
SO THAT IS THE AREA
THAT DONALD TRUMP IS APPARENTLY
IN FAVOR OF, SAYS THAT THESE
SORTS OF ROUNDUPS DONE FOR
ANTICORRUPTION PURPOSES ARE
POTENTIALLY A GOOD THING.
WHAT
IS YOUR REACTION TO THE
SITUATION?
I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS WHAT
HE'S TALKING ABOUT, I DON'T
THINK HE HAS THE FOREIGN POLICY
EXPERIENCE TO UNDERSTAND THE
INNER DYNAMICS OF THE SAUDI
ROYAL FAMILY, BUT I JUST KNOW
THAT IN MY LIFETIME I'VE NEVER
SEEN THE SAUDI ROYALS DO THIS TO
EACH OTHER.
CERTAINLY NOT THIS MUCH AT
ONCE.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE
THIS.
WE TALKED ABOUT THE YEMEN
FACTOR AND SAUDI ARABIA, BUT
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THEY HAVE
THIS BOMB THAT THE YEMENIS ARE
SAYING WE DID IT, WE WERE TRYING
TO BOMB YOUR AIRPORT IN SAUDI
ARABIA, BUT SAUDI ARABIA IS
SAYING THIS IS IRAN'S FAULT,
THAT'S WEIRD, AND LEBANON IS
SOMEHOW INVOLVED -- EVERYTHING
IS HITTING THE FAN IN A SCARY
WAY, AND WE HAVE SUPPORTED SAUDI
ARABIA WITH WEAPONS, THE WAY THE
AIRPORT WAS SAVED WAS WITH AN
AMERICAN MISSILE, SO WE ARE
INVOLVED.
AND I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE
THAT IT WILL END UP GOING
THROUGH BUT THERE WAS THIS
GIGANTIC WEAPONS DEAL THAT HE
PUSHED FOR IN THE WAKE OF HIS
WEIRD CRYSTAL BALL MEETING WITH
SAUDI OFFICIALS, THERE WAS
ANOTHER DEAL FOR BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS IN TANKS -- WE ALREADY
KNOW THAT CLUSTER MUNITIONS THAT
HAVE BEEN USED IN YEMEN WERE
SUPPLIED BY THE U.S., THERE WAS
AN ATTEMPT TO STOP THOSE SALES,
BUT THEN THE POLITICIANS SAID
THAT WOULD STIGMATIZE A WEAPON
THAT IN THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES
COULD LOWER CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.
YES, THAT'S WHAT CLUSTER
MUNITIONS ARE FOR, MAKING SURE
THE WRONG PERSON DOESN'T DIE.
YEAH, WE ARE WRAPPED UP IN THIS
THING, THE SITUATION IN YEMEN IS
ABOUT AS ROUGH AS IT GETS AROUND
THE WORLD OTHER THAN MAYBE
SYRIA, AND WE ARE PART OF THAT,
AND HE FOR WHATEVER REASON,
WHETHER IT'S IDEOLOGICAL,
WHETHER IT'S BUSINESS, IS GOING
RIGHT ALONG WITH IT. AND I
AGREE, IRAN, THAT'S THE BIG
FACTOR, BECAUSE THAT LURKS IN
THE BACKGROUND OF THIS ENTIRE
SAUDI/YEMEN CONFLICT.
IF THAT
GOES FROM BEING A PROXY WAR
EFFECTIVELY, OR 1/2 PROXY WAR,
TO A FULL WAR BETWEEN SAUDI
ARABIA AND IRAN, YOU ARE TALKING
ABOUT SERIOUS DAMAGE BECAUSE
BOTH OF THEM HAVE SIGNIFICANT
MILITARIES.
AND I AGREE WITH
YOUR INITIAL EVALUATION, I DON'T
KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THIS SITUATION
TO TALK ABOUT IT, BUT I
GUARANTEE THAT WHAT I JUST TOLD
YOU IS GREATER THAN THE
UNDERSTANDING OUR PRESIDENT HAS
OF THE SITUATION.
I FEEL LIKE
HE'S LITERALLY PLAYING WITH
FIRE, HE IS BLANKET SIGNING ON
TO THESE SORTS OF PURGES.
IT'S INTERESTING TOO, ONE
THING WE SKIPPED OVER THAT'S
STRANGE IS THAT ALL OF THESE
PEOPLE BEING ARRESTED ARE BEING
HELD IN THE RITZ-CARLTON.
NICE
JAIL YOU HAVE THERE, SAUDI
ARABIA.
THEY ARE SOME OF THE RICHEST
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, I'M
SURE THEY HAVE AN EXPECTATION OF
LUXURY.
THEY ARE GETTING IT.
BUT IN
THAT SAME HOTEL THERE WAS A
BUSINESS CONFERENCE THE WEEK
BEFORE, THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK
ABOUT SAUDI ARABIA'S STATE OWNED
OIL COMPANY, TRUMP ONCE THEM TO
OFFER SHARES IN THE U.S. STOCK
EXCHANGE, SO HE IS A BUSINESS
GUY, THAT IS HIS WHOLE PERSONA.
SO WHEN I LOOK AT THIS AND SEE
HIM TALKING ABOUT OIL AND
PRAISING THE KING, I'M THINKING
THAT WE WILL UNDERSTAND TRUMP
MUCH BETTER IF WE FOLLOW THE
MONEY.
THE WARRING STUFF, I
DON'T THINK HE UNDERSTANDS THAT
SO I TAKE EVERYTHING HE SAYS
WITH A GRAIN OF SALT AND I HOPE
TO GOD THE REST OF THE WORLD
DOES TOO.
I'M WORRIED THAT THE STATE
DEPARTMENT IS BEING RUN LIKE
TRUMP STEAKS.
IT'S BEING RUN BY EXXON MOBIL.
THE OIL FACTOR, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IS GOING ON BUT IT SMELLS
LIKE FOSSIL FUELS AND IT MAKES
ME REALLY NERVOUS.
THAT IS CERTAINLY TRUE.
IT'S
BEEN OBVIOUSLY NOT JUST A
DANGEROUS SITUATION, IT'S BEEN A
DEADLY SITUATION, OVER 10,000
CIVILIANS DEAD, THAT CONTINUES
TO THIS DAY, IT'S A SITUATION
WHERE IF YOU WERE TO GO AROUND
THE COUNTRY AND TALK TO PEOPLE
ABOUT THIS CONFLICT AND OUR ROLE
IN IT, NO ONE WOULD UNDERSTAND
WHY WE ARE IN THE POSITION WE
ARE IN.
I'M NOT JUST TALKING
ABOUT HIPPIES, YOU GO TO THE
STRONGEST TRUMP SUPPORTER IN THE
WORLD, AND IF YOU DON'T PRIME
THEM WITH DONALD TRUMP LOVES
THESE DUDES, BECAUSE THEY WILL
BE ABLE TO SWIFTLY TURNAROUND ON
SAUDI ARABIA THEN, IF YOU JUST
TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE
SITUATION, WHY DO THEY WANT OUR
MONEY BEING SPENT IN SUPPORT OF
THIS CONFLICT IN PART OF THE
WORLD 50% OF THE POPULATION
COULDN'T FIND ON A MAP, THAT
THEY ARE IDEOLOGICALLY
INHERENTLY OPPOSED TO, THAT'S
KILLING CIVILIANS, WHY WOULD
ANYONE BE IN SUPPORT OF THAT?
I
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S THE
UNIFORM POSITION OF OUR CURRENT
EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO DO THIS WHEN
THERE'S NO SUPPORT AMONG THE
POPULATION.
