when the bomb stopped it was time to see what's left of the home day one of the five hour ceasefire brought that he comfort to the people trapped and besieged Eastern Ulta there's no food or water they always say there's a ceasefire but they come back and bomb us the situation is very bad prices are very high we did not have money we stay at the shelter he is no food or water and we do not feel warmth close to 600 people have been killed in the latest onslaught hospitals have been hit and medical supplies are running out suddenly the airplane came towards us my mother screamed get inside the house I told her I will wait for her and the missiles exploded as Jets roared above both sides accused each other of violating the truce look this is the truth this is the ceasefire this place at 50 women and 50 children thank God they left before the airstrikes ordered by the Russian President the Syrian government had agreed to hold fire but despite the violations Moscow is optimistic about its plan specific humanitarian corridors have been set through which aid will be delivered and medical evacuation will be carried out in the opposite direction all civilians who are willing to leave will be able to leave in full compliance with the UN resolution - for a UN source says aid agencies have no plans for mass evacuations they can only bring out the more than 1,000 people in urgent need of medical care but without a consent from all warring sides they still don't have a plan to treat those who need urgent assistance aid agencies including the UN are frustrated that since Saturday words have not translated into action 10 miles distance from Eastern Utah in Damascus enable relief to roll out food medical supplies that are desperately needed to bring two people in the area so the situation is really highly unsatisfactory to say the least there aren't many people in Jota willing to brave the buffeting crossing and even if they wanted to leave it isn't clear where will they go there's not much faith in promises of help in this Damascus suburb under siege for the last five years where even the dead are not exempt from destruction sama bin Javed al-jazeera Gaziantep near the turkey-syria border
