win the World Cup yeah being quite an incredible day in Moscow remember the date July the 1st 2018 the rank Outsiders for the tournament the hosts the Russian national team have beaten PK Ramos Costa they've knocked them out the FIFA World Cup and they're into the quarterfinals quite incredible I'm delighted to be joined by a man that is very well known to English football fans flora Malouda course played with Chelsea amongst other clubs in the French national team really appreciate you joining us today Florin let's talk about the French national team one of the favorites to win the World Cup but how proud we how happy with you were you with the performance yesterday I think it I think that's what we were all expecting for this group of pair this young group of player and like for the group stage were a little bit frustrated because we all believe that that's the level of performance they're capable of to do what this kind of game where they deliver at the right time against the right team I think it would be a massive boost of confidence for the squad but also for the whole country because the feeling at a decision like the French we were proud and and now we know that it is one more step towards the the final goal but I think for for those players is its that's what they need in terms of confidence result quality and passion I guess that with young teams and it's the same with my country England you're never quite sure what you're gonna get sometimes you're gonna get fantastic performances sometimes it's gonna be a little bit less what is the expectation now because France will play Uruguay Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani perhaps more experienced team what your expectations moving forward with the French national team I think first talking about young group of players those players in the team in the Football Club they are leaders and there used to be ambitious and to play to win trophies so now in this work of this different profile of teams I think France is more more confident playing contract because there's a profile of the Linda Mason Cristiano Ronaldo have gone home so the focus is on the next generation of stars one of those is Killian and back the first player to score two goals in a knockout game as a teenager since Pele in 1958 huge pressure on him now tell me what his qualities are first of all is really cold-blooded like like you mentioned its first and I think his ambition is to become the first in every in everything so he has like natural qualities technical physical is very fast as lightning fast and at the same time I think when he plays he always prepare options for it's not only about scoring goals about trying to eliminate he always prepare every kind of option and is making the right choices I'm impressed and everybody compared into the cheery re cherry re one a work for 5:20 I hope that you will be the first to win a workup early a lot of people now in France put their hope in Fillion I hope that won't be too much and that at the end like yesterday everybody will work either we're Malouda thank you for joining me on Stan Collymore show fantastic to see here a generation amazing thank you

you may not associate with winning this trophy could well go to the final England France Belgium Colombia and delighted to be joined by two people that no Colombian football all too well Melissa Ortiz plays the women's Colombian national team Cold War's Wieck is an Englishman like me but has lived in Colombia for the last seven years guys thank you very much for joining me on such a beautiful day what have you seen from Colombia so far that could persuade our audience that this team could go all the way I truly believe that our impact player right now has been one Fernando Quintero Quintero has been well a very underrated previous two World Cup he kind of fell off the map a little bit and now I mean he's been pretty much taking over Thomas role since his injury of his calf injury Quintero has been the main leader the creative player out of the center attacking mid spot so I think with him and then also one of my favorite players on our national team is Santiago ideas the way that he combines with weather out on the right flank is just awesome the way that they communicate and they switch roles constantly it's a famous ending I think that's what also creates that creative spark homicide what's the feeling with in Colombia the Colombian media Columbia pres Colombian fans is - going into this England game kar-wai it's all been framed in the context that England of the inventors of the game that we respect England for their history and this is an exciting new process that's only just beginning in contrast in Colombia sort of almost a process that's ended it's also unfortunately been overshadowed by having stupidly disease injury is he gonna be fit still hot too soon to say how much of a big I mean if hurricane was declared not fitting then that would be a catastrophe across all of the newspapers Raheem Sterling maybe a little deli alley maybe a little but there's one player in the England team hurricane that has to be protected if Falcao is there the ultimate fr Alex Rodriguez down that scale or is the equal to us is high really is the most important player in Colombian World Cup history I mean he's achievement four years ago nobody expected that he was the top goal scorer he's got the best score I saw that goal and the coming journalist beside me were crying because if he couldn't there was only one in the Moroccan are in the man I was yeah it was I mean it was just one of those moments where we turned to each one said did that really happen and of the last 15 goals can be a score they were called hummus has been involved in ton of them this is a player who during qualifying he dragged the team to Russia he was involved in 40% of their goals he's is right I'm gonna ask me both of your expert opinions be kind please I know you're an Englishman puts a live almost naturalized Colombian what you expect him from Colombia against England with a mess without hammers and how far can this Colombian team go call I think set piece is gonna be key England school six goals so far from the stillness set pieces that we've seen from way we haven't mentioned actually yet Jerry Mena six foot five inches needed after a mouse but an absolute giant and he scored two fantastic headers both as say Melissa fun we wanted Fernando Quintero crosses so I think that's going to be really important how both teams attack and defend free kicks but for me England up the edge whether whether hummus plays are not I think it will still be a very level game my score prediction is a 2-1 Colombia obviously I do think that England Aldo played against Belgium in the first group hasn't had that true test yet whereas Colombia you know we've had to somewhat you know major test Japan losing and then Poland so I think we're have that better preparation in terms of gameplay but it's gonna be a very very close game and I think set pieces will be a key factor both sides you know England side and Columbia side cuz we've had scored two or three goals on set pieces with Jeffrey Mena so I'm going to Columbia to one thanks guys for joining me may the best team win you
