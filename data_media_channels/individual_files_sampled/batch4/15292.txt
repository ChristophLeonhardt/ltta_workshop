gnarlie boycotts BC wine in the trans mountain pipeline battle and her environmentalist pals in BC mock her for it if only there were some sort of entity in Ottawa whose job it was to resolve inter provincial disputes in response to BC premier John Horgan banning increased exports of Alberta oil sands from the BC coast Alberta premier Rachel Notley has put a stop to the import of BC wines into Alberta Trade Organization restaurants Canada doesn't like not Lee's decision saying she's using Alberta consumers and BC businesses as pawns and dragging them into and pitting them against each other in an inter provincial trade war and as this interprovincial trade work ramps up with BC now threatening retaliation on Alberta businesses BC premier Horrigan is urging Alberta to step back from their threatening position and the environmentalists and Notley assured us would grant us social license for pipelines if she just taxed us a little harder well they're openly mocking hotly now here's one of not least former staffers who is now the head of Greenpeace Canada a guy named Mike oedema he tweeted Alberta's BC wine boycott is about a politician bullying small businesses on behalf of a giant Texas oil company because another government wanted more science and then there's the standard unclever hashtag mumbo jumbo and a picture of oedema drinking BC wine now here's one of Canada's most prominent NDP supporting environmentalists Naomi Klein she tweeted that she's about to get drunk on BC wine here's a BC environmentalist campaigner with wilderness torrents cost he tweeted that he's going straight to the liquor store for some BC wine now notably silent in this disaster is the federal government and it's for disputes like this that Canada even has a federal government except our current federal government doesn't care about the breakdown of 150 years of Confederation when it has important things to do like police the language of women at Town Hall's Trudeau needed to weigh in and support trans Mountain unequivocally months ago but he hasn't done that and here we are a nation divided now don't get me wrong DC does need to be taught a hard lesson here and I absolutely think boycotts and buy cots are effective I mean we brought Earl's restaurants to its knees when it decided to turf Canadian beef from its menu but the irony here is that a ban on BC wine coming into Alberta will only hurt conservative and right-leaning centrist parts of BC the Okanagan and this is the part of BC that supports pipelines and strong barrier free interprovincial trade they are farmers and entrepreneurs they're natural conservatives but I suppose it's probably pretty hard to boycott Vancouver leftists who don't produce anything ever I mean what can we really do slap a tariff on bucket drum circles put an import fee on marijuana coming into Bounce I mean really what's the value of our interprovincial trade in handmade hemp bracelets anyway now in all seriousness though while not least boycott on its face seems poorly targeted it's really not if you're Rachel Notley it's quite smart politically and you know you have to know it pains me to say that it actually protects BC premier Horgan from any real political fallout like I said earlier the Okanagan both federally and provincially is very right-leaning voting for the free enterprise coalition of BC Liberals provincially and the federal conservatives Horgan doesn't stand to lose any NDP votes if not lea targets her angst at the Okanagan and those wineries and farms well they're generally not unionized so there won't be any pushback from Horgan's supporters in the deep-pocketed BC labor movement this wine embargo looks like not least playing hardball but it's really very politically cagey it looks like notley's really serious about getting trans mount and done and at the same time it she'll NDP premier Horgan from any real criticism from his own side if not Lee we're really serious about selling the BC NDP on the value of Alberta's trans mountain pipeline not only might have tried to meet with Corrigan when she was in Vancouver at the end of November but she didn't even try to meet with him and I of course have the documents to prove it we filed a Freedom of Information request into the office of the BC premier at the time we asked for copies of any documents regarding the premier of Alberta's visit to Vancouver on November 30th 2017 including any communications with her office regarding the planning of the visit the response although a thorough search was conducted no records were located in response to your request your file is now closed so how serious could not Lee be about trans mountain if she didn't even try to sell the pipeline to the premier of BC when she had the opportunity to do it not Lee made no attempt to pacify this trans mountain mess that she had to know is on the horizon since Horgan explicitly campaigned as being against resource development not least trip to BC was an image rehab for her not a pipeline sales pitch for the people of Alberta it was all smoke and mirrors all of this still is not least spent the better part of her adult life fomenting opposition to oil and gas projects not Lee now gets to eat the sour grapes of the fruits of her labor as her friends and NDP colleagues make fun of her for the rebel media I'm Shiela gonna read did you know that I wrote the book on the NDP I did the research the mainstream media refused to do it's called the destroyers and you can get it at the Destroyers dot CA it's the perfect Valentine's gift for the conservative in your life
