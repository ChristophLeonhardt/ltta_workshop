THE SUPREME COURT HAS HANDED
DOWN A DECISION IN REGARD
TO DONALD TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN AND
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY HAVE
DECIDED TO UPHOLD IT.
REMEMBER THAT THIS BAN HAD TO
BE REWRITTEN TWICE AND THE
THIRD VERSION OF IT IS WHAT
THE SUPREME COURT MADE THE
RULING ON.
I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE
COURT'S DECISION WAS SPLIT AMONG
THE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES AND
THE LIBERAL JUSTICES.
WE WILL GET TO THE DISSENTING
OPINION IN JUST A MINUTE.
THE 
LOWER COURTS HAD ESSENTIALLY
REFERRED BACK TO THE
COMMENTS TRUMP HAD MADE DURING
HIS CAMPAIGN AND THE TWEETS
HE PUT OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA JUST
SHOWING HIS UTTER DISDAIN
FOR MUSLIMS AND HOW HE WANTED TO
DO A MUSLIM BAND WHICH IS
AGAINST OUR CONSTITUTION.
ONCE HE GOT TO THE SUPREME
COURT, THE CONSERVATIVE
JUDGES ESSENTIALLY ARGUED THAT
DESPITE WHAT HE WAS SAYING
DURING HIS CAMPAIGN AND DESPITE
THESE TWEETS, WE BELIEVE
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS THE
AUTHORITY TO BAN TRAVEL
FROM CERTAIN COUNTRIES IF IT IS
A NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERN.
THIS IS NUANCED, AND THE
LAW AT STAKE HERE HAS TWO
DIFFERENT PARTS THAT ARE VERY
IMPORTANT.
I'M QUOTING THE WASHINGTON POST
HERE.
UNDER THAT RUBRIC, YOU WOULD SAY
TRUMP APPARENTLY HAS THE
AUTHORITY TO DO IT EVEN IF IT IS
NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT
THE CHALLENGERS POINTED OUT
ANOTHER SECTION OF THE LAW WHICH
SAYS A PERSON MAY NOT BE DENIED
A VISA BECAUSE:
THAT IS 
EQUALLY CLEAR AND
THAT MEANS YOU CANNOT BAN
MUSLIMS BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY
COME FROM.
THAT IS WHY THE COURTS WERE
SPLIT ON IT.
THERE ARE GOOD ARGUMENTS TO BE
MADE THERE.
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, AS
USUAL, BLUNDERED THEIR WAY
INTO THIS.
TRUMP SAID OVER AND
OVER AGAIN IN THE CAMPAIGN
AND THEN AFTERWARD, IT IS THE
MUSLIMS, WE HAVE TO STOP THEM.
WE JUST STOPPED ALL MUSLIMS FROM
COMING INTO THE COUNTRY, A TOTAL
BAN HE SAID UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.
IT WAS INCREDIBLY CLEAR THAT HE
WAS DOING IT BECAUSE THEY ARE
MUSLIMS WHICH CLEARLY VIOLATES
THE LAW, BUT AFTER THE
FIRST TRY THEY REALIZED, WE
CANNOT BAN ALL MUSLIMS, DAMMIT.
THEN THEY HAD A SECOND TRY THAT
ALSO DIDN'T WORK AND IN THE
THIRD TRY WAS LIKE I GOT IT, WE
WILL INCLUDE VENEZUELA AND NORTH
KOREA ON THE LIST AND THAT WAS
ENOUGH FOR CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES
ON THE SUPREME COURT GO, I MEAN,
ON THE THIRD TRY THEY DID
INCLUDE NON-MUSLIM COUNTRIES AND
SO IT COULD HAVE NATIONAL
SECURITY INTEREST IN ALL THESE
COUNTRIES I GUESS IT IS
GOING TO BE OKAY.
THEY JUST NEEDED A TINY THEN
READ TO HANG THEIR HAT ON
TO COMBINE TWO DIFFERENT PHRASES
AND THEY DID, GOOD ENOUGH,
IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL.
WELL, THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE
OF WHY IT WAS IMPORTANT TO
PREVENT THE ELECTION OF SOMEONE
LIKE DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE
HE HAS THE ABILITY TO NOMINATE A
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.
THAT IS WHAT HE DID WITH NEIL
GORESUCH AND HE VOTED WITH THE
CONSERVATIVES AS WAS EXPECTED ON
THIS VERY ISSUE.
I THINK THIS RULING SETS A
DANGEROUS PRECEDENT.
IT SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT
UNDER TRUMP, OBVIOUSLY, BUT EVEN
IF YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT HAS
A POLITICAL IDEOLOGY THAT YOU
AGREE WITH BUT THAT PERSON
WANTS TO BAN TRAVEL FROM A
COUNTRY FOR RACIAL REASONS,
RELIGIOUS REASONS,
WHATEVER, NOW THEY ARE ABLE TO
DO IT.
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS CLAIM I
PERCEIVE THIS COUNTRY TO BE
A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT, SO
I'M GOING TO BAN TRAVEL.
IT IS NOT A GOOD PRESIDENT TO
SET AND THE SUPREME COURT
HAS MADE ITS RULING.
PRESUMABLY A DEMOCRATIC
PRESIDENT COULD COME IN AND
THEY WOULD NEVER DO THIS.
AS I WAS SAYING IT, THE RIGHT
WINGS THINK THAT DEMOCRATIC
PRESIDENTS WOULD WANT US.
WE ARE BANNING ALL WHITE
COUNTRIES.
PREPOSTEROUS, BUT THAT IS THE
THING.
THAT IS WHY IT IS SO ONE-SIDED,
REPUBLICANS DO WANT TO
DISCRIMINATE AND DEMOCRATS
DON'T.
THEY GET TO DISCRIMINATE IN THE
OTHER SIDE DOESN'T.
I DON'T WANT ANY DISCRIMINATION
BUT IT IS NOT GOOD THAT THE
RIGHT-WING DOES IT.
THE TRAGIC PART IS YES, TRUMP
WENT.
MITCH MCKENNA LATER BRAGS THAT
IT WAS HIS PROUDEST MOMENT TO
BLOCK MERRICK GARLAND FROM
THE COURT FOR OVER A YEAR IN
RECORD-BREAKING OBSTRUCTION LIKE
HAHA, YOU DIDN'T FIGHT BACK AND
THEN WE TRASH WHATEVER RULES WE
NEED TO TRASH IN THE SENATE TO
APPROVE GORESUCH.
DON'T EVER PROTEST, DON'T EVER
HARASS ANY OF THESE PEOPLE
IF YOU SEE THEM IN PUBLIC, NEVER
FIGHT BACK, YOU NEED TO BE
CIVIL IF YOU ARE ON THE LEFT,
THIS IS THE REASON WHY I AM
DONE WITH IT.
THE FUNNY PART IS ROBERTS
SAID THAT IT IS NOT RIGHT TO USE
A REASONABLE OBSERVER STANDARD.
SOTO MAYOR HAD ARGUED ANY
REASONABLE OBSERVER, AND THAT IS
A LEGAL STANDARD, WOULD SEE THAT
DONALD TRUMP CLEARLY NEEDS HE
WANTS A MUSLIM BAN BECAUSE HE
KEEPS SAYING IT OVER AND
OVER AGAIN.
THAT IS WHY WE'RE NOT GOING TO
USE THIS STANDARD, WE'RE GOING
TO
USE A STANDARD CALLED RATIONAL
BASIS FOR REVIEW.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
IT MEANS IF THERE IS ANY
PLAUSIBLE REASON WHY THEY MIGHT
HAVE DONE IT FOR A LEGITIMATE
REASON, WE ARE GOING TO SAY THAT
THERE PROBABLY IS, IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT HE DID NOT MEAN
ALL
MUSLIMS.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE DID NOT
MEAN HE WANTS TO DISCRIMINATE.
GOOD ENOUGH.
THAT IS THE LOWEST STANDARD YOU
COULD POSSIBLY HAVE.
DID ANY OF THE CONSERVATIVE
JUSTICE IS NO, NO
REASONABLE PERSON THINK IT'S
ANYTHING BUT A MUSLIM BAN.
