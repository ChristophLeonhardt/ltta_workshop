1
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,191
>> ROSIE O'DONNELL REALLY,

2
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,426
REALLY HATES TRUMP.

3
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:12,495
BUT UNLIKE MOST PEOPLE IN HER

4
00:00:12,496 --> 00:00:14,564
WORLD WHO REALLY HATE TRUMP, SHE

5
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:17,968
CAN CLAIM IT'S NOT A NEW THING.

6
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:20,003
SHE'S BEEN HATING TRUMP FOR MANY

7
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:20,437
YEARS.

8
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:23,306
SHE'S NO CLOSER TO WINNING THAT

9
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:23,640
DEBATE.

10
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:24,774
SHE STILL HAS TO THE RECOVERED

11
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:25,742
FROM THE 2016 ELECTION.

12
00:00:25,743 --> 00:00:27,410
HERE'S PART OF IT.

13
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:29,779
>> WE ARE GOING TO RIGHT THE

14
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,513
SHIP.

15
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:32,015
THERE'S NO WAY HE'LL PREVAIL

16
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:34,651
BECAUSE HE'S EVIL AND DARK.

17
00:00:34,652 --> 00:00:38,455
I ALWAYS THOUGHT WHY DIDN'T THEY

18
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:44,628
COUNTERPROGRAM HIS RALLIES.

19
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:46,096
HE WANTS TO SEND THE MILITARY TO

20
00:00:46,097 --> 00:00:47,130
THE BORDER.

21
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:48,765
I WANT TO SEND THE MILITARY TO

22
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:52,335
THE WHITE HOUSE TO GET HIM.

23
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:55,238
[LAUGHTER]

24
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:57,440
>> MARTIAL LAW.

25
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:00,010
SHE THINKS THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

26
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:02,545
>> YOU'VE BEEN HERE ALL YOUR

27
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:02,846
LIFE.

28
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:04,347
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE A FAMOUS ACTOR.

29
00:01:04,348 --> 00:01:08,518
IF I WAS RUNNING THE HOLLYWOOD

30
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,552
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, I WOULD

31
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:12,489
TELL HER TO PULL BACK.

32
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,858
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING US.

33
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:20,096
>> IT WAS A JOKE, A THINLY

34
00:01:20,097 --> 00:01:20,597
VEILED JOKE.

35
00:01:20,598 --> 00:01:24,067
THAT WAS INSANE.

36
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:28,005
THAT'S A COUP.

37
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:29,239
>> Sean: DON'T OTHER PEOPLE IN

38
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,175
HER WORLD SAY, "LOOK, ROSIE, WE

39
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:35,211
GET IT, YOU DON'T LIKE TRUMP.

40
00:01:35,212 --> 00:01:36,413
BUT YOU'RE DISCREDITING YOURSELF

41
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:39,215
AND THE REST OF US BY ACTING

42
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:40,183
LIKE A MENTAL PATIENT ON TV.

43
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,452
DON'T DO THAT."

44
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:43,787
>>THAT SOUNDS ENTIRELY

45
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:44,187
REASONABLE.

46
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:45,388
WHY WOULD SOMETHING LIKE THAT

47
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:45,722
HAPPEN.

48
00:01:45,723 --> 00:01:46,890
I KNOW ROSIE.

49
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:49,292
I KNEW HER BACK IN THE DAY.

50
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:51,828
WE WERE VERY FRIENDLY AND

51
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:52,195
WONDERFUL.

52
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:53,196
I DON'T KNOW THAT SHE WOULD TALK

53
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,397
TO ME NOW.

54
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:56,132
BUT I DISAGREE WITH HER.

55
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:57,801
AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SIT

56
00:01:57,802 --> 00:02:00,136
CROSS FROM HER AND SAY, "I

57
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:00,670
DISAGREE.

58
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:03,139
AND EVEN ON THAT SHOW, ALL THEY

59
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,508
DID WAS LAUGH.

60
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:09,112
WHY DIDN'T ANYBODY OFFER A

61
00:02:09,113 --> 00:02:12,282
DISSENTING OPINION.

62
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:15,318
>> MARTIAL LAW?

63
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,686
HOW OFTEN DO YOU HEAR STUFF LIKE

64
00:02:16,687 --> 00:02:19,189
THAT HERE AT DINNER?

65
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,828
>> MONDAY THROUGH SUNDAY.

66
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,763
>> SO IT'S UBIQUITOUS HERE.

67
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:29,399
>> I'LL HEAR IT FROM SOME OF THE

68
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,733
ACTORS.

69
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:33,436
BUT THEN WE'LL GO THROUGH AND

70
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:33,970
SHOOTING SOMETHING.

71
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:37,240
AND THEN THEY'RE LIKE, "HEY, I'M

72
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:37,607
WITH YOU."

73
00:02:37,608 --> 00:02:38,775
>>THAT'S SUCH AN INTERESTING

74
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:39,075
POINT.

75
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:44,214
AND I'VE NOTICED THIS EXACT

76
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:44,514
THING.

77
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:47,617
HOW DIFFERENT ARE THE OPINIONS

78
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:49,352
OF THE CREWS?

79
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:51,054
>> I WOULD SAY THEY'RE

80
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:52,689
DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED.

81
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,758
>> DON'T THE ACTORS AT SOME

82
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,493
POINT SAY, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ON

83
00:02:56,494 --> 00:02:58,228
THE SIDE OF THE AVERAGE PERSON,

84
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:59,696
THE UNDERDOG.

85
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:03,099
I'M SURRENDERED BY UNDERDOGS,

86
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,436
BUT I HATE THEM FROM THEIR

87
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:06,736
VIEWS.

88
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:07,904
>> ALL WE HEAR IS WHAT WE WANT

89
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:09,906
TO HEAR, MOST OF THE TIME.

90
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:11,474
I'M PUTTING MYSELF IN THAT CAMP

91
00:03:11,475 --> 00:03:14,044
BECAUSE I AM AN ACTOR.

92
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:15,445
I TRAVEL THE WORLD.

93
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:18,581
I DO THINGS THAT I THINK HAVE

94
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:19,215
SOME SUBSTANCE.

95
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:20,450
I'M IN BAD PLACES.

96
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:23,186
BUT A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE,

97
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:29,893
YOU'RE CODDLES AS AN ACTOR AND

98
00:03:29,894 --> 00:03:31,961
TOLD YOU'RE GREAT ALL THE TIME.

99
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,596
THEIR OPINION MEANS MORE THAN

100
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:35,265
THE GUY CLAPPING.

101
00:03:35,266 --> 00:00:00,000
>> IF YOU'RE MAKING $10 MILLION
