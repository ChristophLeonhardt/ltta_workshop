LOPEZ OEB LA DOOR.

5
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,689
HE IS A CRITIC OF PRESIDENT

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,590
TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICIES.

7
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:26,593
IT DIDN'T STOP THE PRESIDENT

8
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:27,761
FROM TWEETING OVERNIGHT.

9
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:28,495
HE SAID CONGRATULATIONS ON

10
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:30,998
BECOMING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF

11
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:31,331
MEXICO.

12
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:32,366
I LOOK VERY MUCH FORWARD TO

00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:38,472

SHORTLY AFTER EXIT POLLS SHOWED

18
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:59,126
AN OVERWHELMING VICTORY.

19
00:00:59,127 --> 00:00:59,893
HIS CHALLENGERS CONCEDED AND

20
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:01,428
SUPPORTERS POURED INTO THE

21
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:02,596
STREETS TO CELEBRATE FUELED BY

22
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:04,464
ANGER AT THE STATUS QUO THEY

POVERTY.

28
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:35,829
HE WAS ELECTED AS THEIR SAVIOR.

29
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,900
>> HE IS A 64-YEAR-OLD NATIONAL

30
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:41,268
LIFT VOWS TO ERADICATE THEFT

31
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:41,735
AND FRAUD.

32
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:47,341
HE IS THE MESSIAH TO RESCUE

33
00:01:47,342 --> 00:01:48,975
THEM FROM INEQUALITY, THE

34
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,177
VIOLENCE THAT HAS TAKEN 250,000

35
00:01:50,178 --> 00:01:51,845
LIVES IN THE LAST DECADE.

00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:53,480
>> Eric: IT'S SO TRAGIC WITH

37
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:55,115
THE DRUG CARTELS THERE.

00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,918
HE IS SO AT ODDS WITH THE

39
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:58,385
ADMINISTRATION.

40
00:01:58,386 --> 00:01:59,553
HOW DOES THAT AFFECT US?

41
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:00,987
>> IN MANY WAYS.

42
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:01,421
YOU'RE RIGHT.

43
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:02,823
THINK ABOUT IT.

44
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:06,760
WE HAVE A 2000 MILE BORDER.

45
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:08,862
MEXICO IS LATIN AMERICA'S

46
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:17,371
MILLIONS OF MEXICANS PROVIDE A

47
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:18,972
BACKBONE TO OUR AGRICULTURE AND

48
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:21,775
SERVICE SECTORS AND PLAYS A KEY

49
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:24,778
ROLE IN TWO OF AMERICA'S

00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:26,246
PROBLEMS, DRUGS AND IMMIGRATION.

51
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:34,421
HE SAYS HE WILL PULL THE

52
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:36,923
MILITARY BACK FROM FIGHTING THE

53
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:37,657
CARTELS.

54
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,960
NOW ON IMMIGRATION HE MADE

55
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:40,660
CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENTS

56
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,361
SUGGESTING OPEN BORDERS.

57
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,230
WITH NO DESIRE TO HELP THE U.S.

58
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,532
STOP IMMIGRANTS FROM CROSSING

59
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:45,999
THE BORDER.

60
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,104
ECONOMY BY PICKING A FIGHT WITH

61
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:51,805
THE U.S.

62
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:53,206
A LOT OF SPECULATION HOW HE

63
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:58,412
MIGHT GET ALONG WITH PRESIDENT

64
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:00,714
TRUMP WHO IS UNIVERSALLY

65
00:03:00,715 --> 00:03:01,415
DISLIKED IN MEXICO.

66
00:03:01,416 --> 00:00:00,000
ONE COLUMNIST SAID I DON'T
