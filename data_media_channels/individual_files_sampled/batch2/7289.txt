DEMOCRAT TIM RYAN OF OHIO HAS BROKEN WITH HIS PARTY AND IS PUSHING FOR SOME TAX POLICY IDEAS THAT DON'T SEEM TOO FAR OFF OF SOME OF THE RHETORIC COMING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE THESE DAYS. HERE'S HIM EXPLAINING. TO BE COMPETITIVE GLOBALLY WE HAVE TO REDUCE THE CORPORATE TAX RATE. WE ARE JUST NOT COMPETITIVE GLOBALLY BECAUSE OF THAT. THE GOAL FOR US, AND I KNOW THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS, PEOPLE ARE AGAINST IT, IS TO CREATE THE NEW MODEL. WE CAN'T JUST BE A PARTY OF REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH, WE NEED TO BE THE PARTY OF THE CREATION OF WEALTH IN COMMUNITIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. NOT JUST SILICON VALLEY OR WALL STREET, ALL OVER. I'VE BEEN TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA BUT IF ALSO BEEN TO SOUTH CAROLINA AND BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, I WILL BE UP IN INDIANA, I WILL BE IN KENTUCKY TO GO TO THESE PLACES AND SEE THE KIND OF GROWTH MESSAGE, OPPORTUNITY MESSAGE, NOT COMPLETELY ANTIBUSINESS MESSAGE, NOT BEING HOSTILE TO BUSINESS, PLAY IN DEMOCRATIC CROWDS IN COMMUNITIES THAT KNOW THEY NEED INVESTMENT AND KNOW THEY NEED GROWTH, KNOW THEY NEED SOMEBODY TO HIRE THE WORKERS WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT, IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT THE ECONOMIC QUESTION WHICH IS HOW DO WE GET MONEY OUT OF THE COASTS AND INTO THE INDUSTRIAL MIDWEST AND CREATE JOBS IN PLACES LIKE THE ONES I REPRESENT, THAT'S A GAME CHANGER FOR ME. TWO THINGS RIGHT OFF THE BAT, FIRST THAT HE EVEN USED THE TERM REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH STOP FRAMING THINGS THE WAY CONSERVATIVES AND REPUBLICANS WANT YOU TO, THAT'S INSANE. COME UP WITH SOME OTHER TERM. EVEN IF I DISAGREE WITH YOUR POLICIES YOU CAN TRY TO COME UP WITH A WAY TO EXPRESS IT THAT DOESN'T IMMEDIATELY CONFIRM EVERYTHING REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN SAYING. AND SECOND, WITH THIS AS HIS ECONOMIC CORE MESSAGE, HE'S GOING TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA? YOU COULD PROBABLY SAVE YOURSELF THOSE STOPS BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T LEARN ANYTHING FROM THE LAST ELECTION. IF HE'S TAKING ABOUT 2020 AND THIS IS THE CORE MESSAGE? GOOD LUCK. THAT SEEMS QUESTIONABLE. THAT WAS PATHETIC. I DON'T CARE IF HE'S A FRIEND OF THE SHOW, I DON'T CARE IF HE'S BEEN A GUEST A BILLION TIMES, THAT WAS A RIDICULOUS ARGUMENT. HE SAID TAKE THE WEALTH OUT OF THE COASTS. NOT MAKE SURE BOTH ARE DOING WELL, TAKE IT OUT OF THE COASTS. THAT IS REPUBLICAN FRAMING, I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S COMING FROM OR TRYING TO GO WE KNOW. HE'S TRYING TO APPEASE CORPORATE DONORS, BUT IF YOU ARE GENUINELY CONCERNED ABOUT MIDDLE AMERICA AND MAKING SURE THEY HAVE JOBS AND DECENT WAGES, WHY DON'T YOU DO SOME THING ABOUT AUTOMATION, OR THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT JUST APPLIED FOR MORE FOREIGN WORKERS TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY AND TAKE LOW-LEVEL JOBS AWAY FROM AMERICANS? DO SOMETHING TO PROTECT ACCESSIBLE EDUCATION. DO A BILLION THINGS THAT COULD HELP PEOPLE IN AMERICA ACTUALLY SUCCEED. WHY DON'T YOU DO SOMETHING TO PENALIZE THE COMPANIES THAT OUTSOURCE THESE JOBS? REALLY, YOU ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT CUTTING TAXES BECAUSE THAT'S WORKED OUT SO WELL SO FAR? WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE LIKELY PUSH TO SLASH TAXES, HOW SOME DEMOCRATS WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY SIGN ON TO IT, THAT'S BAD BECAUSE IT INCREASES THE CHANCES IT WILL GET PASSED, AND THEY CAN ALSO SAY IT'S BIPARTISAN TAX REFORM, IS IT POSSIBLE HE WILL BE ONE OF THOSE? YOU DON'T ENTER INTO THE NEGOTIATIONS ALREADY HAVING SURRENDERED SO MUCH. ON THE OTHER HAND, NANCY PELOSI ADDRESSED TRUMP'S PROPOSED TAX PLAN BY SAYING THIS YOU HAVE TO SAY MORE, BUT THAT IS THE FIRST BLOW AGAINST THE TAX PLAN, THAT IT IS FIRST AND FOREMOST AND ONLY FOR BILLIONAIRES. NOT THAT IT'S THE PATH TO COMPETITIVENESS GLOBALLY FOR AMERICAN CORPORATIONS. I HAVE TO JUMP IN ONE MORE TIME AND GET IT OUT OF MY SYSTEM, THEN YOU CAN RAGE HOW MANY CORPORATIONS, HOW MANY BANKS, PAY NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES? NOTHING? IN FACT, THEY GET A TAX REBATE. HOW MANY OF YOU MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS, WORKING-CLASS AMERICANS, HAVE TO PAY FEDERAL TAXES? AND IF YOU DON'T YOU WILL HAVE THE IRS BREATHING DOWN YOUR NECK, NICKEL AND DIMING YOU. BUT ALL THESE GIANT TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES AND BANKS THAT PROFIT THE EFFECTIVE CORPORATE TAX RATE, THEY PAY LESS TAXES THAN WORKING-CLASS AMERICANS AND THIS ASSHOLE HAS THE AUDACITY TO STAND THERE AND SAY THEY WILL CREATE JOBS. WHAT THEY DO IS CONTINUALLY CUT JOBS, OUTSOURCE THEM, AUTOMATE THEM, AND BASICALLY SCREW US OVER. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. JOHN AND ANA MENTIONED ABOUT FRIEND OF THE SHOW, AND ALL THIS. WAS, I GUESS. A LONG TIME AGO, IN A PLACE FAR FAR AWAY, ON WILSHIRE, WHEN WE DID THIS SHOW AND HAVE A LOT MORE GUESTS, IT WAS A THREE-HOUR SHOW, RADIO AND ONLINE, TIM RYAN WAS PROBABLY THE CONGRESSMAN WHO MOST CAME ON THE YOUNG TURKS. WE APPRECIATED THAT, I LIKED HIM PERSONALLY, I WENT OUT A COUPLE TIMES IN DC WITH THEM, ETC., BUT THIS TO ME IS NOT PERSONAL, THIS STATEMENT OF HIS, AND THIS IDEA, IS 100% WRONG. AND THIS HAPPENS TO PEOPLE, MAN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS INTENTIONS WERE WHEN HE FIRST CAME IN, HE WAS VERY YOUNG WHEN HE DID, HE WENT AGAINST AN INCUMBENT, BEAT HIM, ETC., BUT I DO KNOW THAT WASHINGTON SEEPS IN, AND I'M SO GLAD WE DIDN'T BASE THIS SHOW IN WASHINGTON, DC, BECAUSE IT'S TOXIC AND GETS INTO YOUR SYSTEM. YOU CAN PUT ASIDE HIS INTENTIONS OR WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM, JUST JUDGE HIM ON THE POLICY. AND THE POLICY IS DISASTROUS. AND THE FRAMING IS DISASTROUS, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WHEN YOU HAVE A DEMOCRAT SAYING WE SHOULD STOP REDISTRIBUTING WEALTH, YOU JUST HANDED REPUBLICANS A GIANT GIFT. YOU TOLD THEM DEMOCRATS ARE THE BAD GUYS WHO REDISTRIBUTE WEALTH. CAN WE START IT BEFORE WE STOP IT? IF YOU WANT TO DO THE RIGHT FRAMING, AND IT'S NOT JUST FRAMING, IT'S REALITY, THERE IS A PARTY HERE IN AMERICA THAT HAS REDISTRIBUTED WEALTH, IT'S THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. CORPORATIONS USE TO PAY ABOUT 35% OF THE TAXES IN AMERICA, NOW THEY PAY 11% OF THE TAXES IN AMERICA. FROM 1952 TO 2015, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. WHERE DID THEY REDISTRIBUTE THOSE TAXES TO? TO THE PAYROLL TAX, WHICH IS PAID BY MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS, THAT WENT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM AROUND 10% TO AROUND ONE THIRD OF ALL OUR TAXES. CORPORATIONS REDISTRIBUTED THE WEALTH SO THEY GOT TO PUT IT IN THEIR POCKET AND THEY MADE YOU PAY FOR IT. AND INSTEAD OF MAKING THAT CLAIM, WHICH IS BASED IN FACT, HE HELPS THE REPUBLICAN TALKING POINTS BY PRETENDING THE DEMOCRATS ARE DOING REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH. I CAN SHOW YOU EXACTLY HOW TAXES HAVE GONE DOWN PRECIPITOUSLY, THE EFFECTIVE CORPORATE TAX RATE, AND TAXES FOR THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY. IN WHAT REPUBLICANS CALL THE GOLDEN ERA, OF THE 1950S AND 60S, THE HIGHEST MARGINAL TAX RATE WAS 91%. THAT'S NOT 91% OF ALL YOUR MONEY, IT WAS AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT, IN TODAY'S DOLLARS AND MIGHT BE AFTER 10 MILLION THEY START TAXING YOU AT THAT RATE. WE HAD A BOOMING ECONOMY, WAGES WERE GOING UP ALONG WITH PRODUCTIVITY. INSTEAD NOW WE HAVE IS A UNILATERAL SURRENDER. AND IT'S NOT SURRENDERING TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT'S SURRENDERING TO THE DONORS BECAUSE THE DONORS PAY FOR REALLY STRONG REPUBLICANS WHO PUSH THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM TO THE RIGHT, AND REALLY WEAK, COMPLIANT DEMOCRATS WHO GO THE REPUBLICANS ARE SO RIGHT. THOSE DEMOCRATS, THEY JUST KEEP TAKING FROM THE POOR RICH, THOSE POOR MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS WHO JUST CAN'T SEEM TO CATCH A BREAK. AND WHAT ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT TAKING MONEY OUT OF THE COASTS AND PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY? IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT JOB CREATION, THAT'S GREAT, WE ARE ALL IN FAVOR OF THAT. HERE, BE IN FAVOR OF MAYBE A $2 TRILLION INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE, WHY DON'T YOU INTRODUCE THAT PACKAGE? WHICH CREATES ROADS, BRIDGES, CLEAN WATER ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND WOULD CREATE JOBS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WITHOUT PUNISHING THE COASTS. YOU SOUND LIKE A WEAKSAUCE REPUBLICAN, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THE DONORS LOVE. AND LAST THING, THIS GUY CHALLENGED NANCY PELOSI, AND I HAVE NO LOVE FOR NANCY PELOSI, I THINK SHE IS WAY PAST HER TIME, BUT ON THIS ISSUE SHE IS EXACTLY RIGHT, SHE HAS THE RIGHT FRAMING, AND YOU THOUGHT IT'S A YOUNG UPSTART CHALLENGING NANCY PELOSI, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT RYAN WAS GOING IN THIS DIRECTION, MAYBE THAT'S A GREAT THING NO, FORGET IT. YOU'RE TELLING ME YOUR GENIUS IDEA IS TO CHALLENGE THAT THE PELOSI FROM THE RIGHT? LOOK AT WHAT CONGRESSMAN RYAN SAID THERE I'VE BEEN TO IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE, BUT I ALSO WENT TO SOUTH CAROLINA. THAT'S THE THIRD VOTING STATE IN THE PRIMARIES. THAT'S NOT AN ALSO, THAT'S NOT A BUT, THAT'S AN AND. YOU WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT AS A FRESH FACE AND YOUR FRESH IDEA IS TO DO THE SAME THING DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN DOING FOR 40 YEARS, BOWING TO REPUBLICANS AND CORPORATE DONORS? SAD, SAD END TO A ONCE PROMISING CAREER.
