FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?
>> WE KNEW THE PRESIDENT'S HANDS
WERE TIED ONCE THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE SHOULD THE REQUEST TO
THE WHITE HOUSE FOR THE
PRESIDENT TO ASK THE FBI TO OPEN
UP A SUPPLEMENT INVESTIGATION
INTO JUDGE KAVANAUGH BACKGROUND.
THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T HAVE MUCH

HAS TO CONSIDER ALL OF THIS.
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH RELEASED A
STATEMENT SAYING: THROUGHOUT

I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY HAVE
REQUESTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO
COOPERATE."

NOMINEE, IT'S ALL OUT WAR
BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND
DEMOCRATS.
I TALKED TO A REPUBLICAN
POLITICAL OPERATIVE WHO TOLD ME
WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT SEAT IN THE
SUPREME COURT COMES UP.
MAYBE IT'S RUTH BADER GINSBURG.
RATHER THAN NOMINATING A MORE
LIBERAL JUDGE THE PRESIDENT MAY
