00:00:02,597 --> 00:00:03,531
>> Greg: WHOEVER CUT THAT,

2
00:00:03,532 --> 00:00:06,834
YOU'RE GOING HOME EARLY.

3
00:00:06,835 --> 00:00:08,002
THERE IS NOTHING MORE DELICIOUS

4
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:11,672
THAN THE TRUTH SERVED COLD.

5
00:00:11,673 --> 00:00:14,241
HERE IS TED KOPPEL TELLING OUR

6
00:00:14,242 --> 00:00:15,075
NATIONS HALL MONITOR BRIAN

7
00:00:15,076 --> 00:00:16,610
STELTER WHAT WE ALREADY KNEW.

8
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:19,880
>> DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN VERY,

9
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:22,816
VERY GOOD FOR BASEBALL.

10
00:00:22,817 --> 00:00:24,919
HE HAS BEEN WONDERFUL THE

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,621
INDUSTRY.

12
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:30,357
RATINGS ARE UP, IT MEANS YOU

13
00:00:30,358 --> 00:00:32,259
CAN'T DO WITHOUT DONALD TRUMP.

14
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,395
YOU WOULD BE LOST WITHOUT

15
00:00:34,396 --> 00:00:35,229
DONALD TRUMP.

16
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,465
>> TED, YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT

17
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:38,766
TRUE.

18
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:41,535
>> CNN'S RATINGS WOULD BE IN THE

19
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:42,203
TOILET WITHOUT DONALD TRUMP.

20
00:00:42,204 --> 00:00:43,837
>> YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.

21
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:45,439
YOU ARE PLAYING FOR LAUGHS.

22
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,042
>> Greg: I HAVEN'T SEEN BRIAN

23
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:49,777
STELTER THAT DEFENSIVE SINCE

24
00:00:49,778 --> 00:00:51,278
ANDERSON COOPER STOLE HIS

25
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:51,645
TOUPEE.

26
00:00:51,646 --> 00:00:53,080
KOPPEL HIT THE ARTERY AND

27
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:53,881
STELTER COULDN'T STOP THE

28
00:00:53,882 --> 00:00:55,649
BLEEDING OR THE LAUGHTER.

29
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,051
KOPPEL KNOWS THE MEDIA OPERATES

30
00:00:57,052 --> 00:00:58,686
ON TWO LIES THEY WOULD RATHER

31
00:00:58,687 --> 00:00:59,453
FORGET.

32
00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:01,222
ONE THAT THEIR EFFUSIVE COVERAGE

33
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:02,223
OF TRUMP DIDN'T HELP NOMINATE

34
00:01:02,224 --> 00:01:04,058
THE GUY.

35
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:06,060
OH, BUT YOU DID, YOU BLUBBERING

36
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:07,061
FAVORS.

37
00:01:07,062 --> 00:01:08,028
CNN LEAD THAT CHART UNDER THE

38
00:01:08,029 --> 00:01:09,697
ASSUMPTION THAT HILLARY HAD IT

39
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:10,130
WON ALREADY.

40
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:11,799
FOCUS ONLY ON TRUMP KNOWING

41
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:18,539
THEIR PROFITABLE OBSESSION.

42
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,675
TWO, THAT SOMEHOW TRUMP HAD

43
00:01:21,676 --> 00:01:22,843
THREATENED TO PRESS FREEDOM.

44
00:01:22,844 --> 00:01:23,611
HARDLY.

45
00:01:23,612 --> 00:01:24,845
HE IS BUYING THOSE SAME

46
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:26,513
EXECUTIVES THEIR FOURTH AND

47
00:01:26,514 --> 00:01:27,881
FIFTH HOMES.

48
00:01:27,882 --> 00:01:29,250
SINCE TRUMP, THE PRESS HAS BEEN

49
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:29,650
FEVERISH.

50
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:30,718
EVERY DAY IS THE APOCALYPSE AND

51
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,119
EVERY CRITIC A FEARLESS HERO.

52
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,490
TO CNN, ESPECIALLY TO, TRUMP IS

53
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:38,859
EBOLA AND THE KKK COMBINED.

54
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,361
IT'S WHY THE C IN CNN STANDS FOR

55
00:01:40,362 --> 00:01:40,861
CARTOON.

56
00:01:40,862 --> 00:01:42,129
NOT A BELIEVER THE POINT BUT WE

57
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,797
KNOW HOW EASY THE PRESS WAS

58
00:01:43,798 --> 00:01:46,066
UNDER OBAMA EVENT HAS HE

59
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:46,800
ACTUALLY TARGETED JOURNALISTS.

60
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:49,403
LET'S WATCH THAT CLIP AGAIN.

61
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:52,539
>> CNN'S RATINGS WOULD BE IN THE

62
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,207
TOILET WITHOUT DONALD TRUMP.

63
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,276
>> YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.

64
00:01:55,277 --> 00:01:56,877
YOU ARE PLAYING FOR LAUGHS.

65
00:01:56,878 --> 00:01:58,479
>> Greg: I HOPE THAT SHOWS UP

66
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,416
ON RELIABLE SOURCES.

67
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:04,885
>> Dana: IT'S SO TRUE.

68
00:02:04,886 --> 00:02:08,255
>> Greg: LET'S GO WITH YOU.

69
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,856
TED'S POINT.

70
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:10,224
I CALLED HIM TED BECAUSE WE KNOW

71
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:11,625
EACH OTHER WELL.

72
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:12,860
IT'S NOT JUST AN OBSESSION.

73
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:14,061
IT'S A PROFITABLE ONE.

74
00:02:14,062 --> 00:02:15,429
>> Dana: I DON'T UNDERSTAND

75
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,031
WHY BRIAN STELTER WOULDN'T JUST

76
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:18,232
SAY YOU BET YOUR LIFE.

77
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:19,633
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

78
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:20,734
PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED AND THEY WANT

79
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:22,136
TO WATCH AND THEY CAN'T GET

80
00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:22,469
ENOUGH.

81
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,104
THEY DON'T WANT TO WATCH OTHER

82
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:24,438
SHOWS.

83
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,472
THEY ONLY WANT TO WATCH US.

84
00:02:25,473 --> 00:02:27,274
WE ARE BRINGING YOU THE STORY.

85
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:29,109
WHY WOULDN'T HE SAY THAT?

86
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,878
>> Greg: THAT WAS AN

87
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,945
UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENT, JUAN.

88
00:02:31,946 --> 00:02:34,214
>> Dana: I JUST SPILLED ON MY

89
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:34,515
WATER.

90
00:02:34,516 --> 00:02:36,450
>> Juan: YOU JUST WANTED TO

91
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:36,950
EXPRESS YOURSELF.

92
00:02:36,951 --> 00:02:37,818
>> Dana: VERY EXCITED.

93
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:40,187
>> Juan: YOU SPEAK WITH YOUR

94
00:02:40,188 --> 00:02:41,622
HANDS.

95
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:43,157
>> Greg: JAZZ HANDS.

96
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:45,025
>> Juan: IT COULD BE.

97
00:02:45,026 --> 00:02:45,826
JAZZ HANDS.

98
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:47,628
AT LEAST SHE DIDN'T FLIP US THE

99
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:48,028
BIRD.

100
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:49,430
>> Dana: THINKING ABOUT IT.

101
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:51,231
>> Juan: I THINK STELTER WAS

102
00:02:51,232 --> 00:02:51,999
MAKING THE CASE OF TRUMP ATTACKS

103
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,602
THE PRESS BECAUSE, AND ALSO

104
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:57,338
BECAUSE IT'S ANTI-TRUMP NEWS

105
00:02:57,339 --> 00:02:59,473
THAT DRIVES THE MEDIA.

106
00:02:59,474 --> 00:03:01,275
60 MINUTES, WITH THEIR STORMY

107
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:02,409
INTERVIEW, GOT RECORD RATINGS,

108
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,310
HIGHEST RATINGS IN TEN YEARS BUT

109
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,611
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

110
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:06,080
GETTING AWAY FROM THE IDEA WHICH

111
00:03:06,081 --> 00:03:08,115
IS THAT LES MOONVES AS, IN HIS

112
00:03:08,116 --> 00:03:11,018
HEYDAY WHEN HE WAS AT CBS, SAID

113
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:12,286
GUESS WHAT VERY DONALD TRUMP MAY

114
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:14,655
NOT BE GOOD FOR AMERICA.

115
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:16,423
BUT HE'S GREAT FOR CBS.

116
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:18,759
THAT MEANS GREAT FOR RATINGS AND

117
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,126
EARNINGS.

118
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:19,860
>> Judge Jeanine: HERE'S THE

119
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:22,129
BOTTOM LINE WITH THIS GUY,

120
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:22,463
STELTER.

121
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:24,631
HE WANTS TO BE THE CENTER OF

122
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:26,433
ATTENTION AND HE IS SITTING

123
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:28,435
THERE TELLING TEN KOPPEL OH, THE

124
00:03:28,436 --> 00:03:30,137
NEWS BUSINESS IS MORE

125
00:03:30,138 --> 00:03:35,008
COMPLICATED THAN THAT, TED.

126
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:36,110
REALLY?

127
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:38,145
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT STORMY

128
00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:39,046
DANIELS.

129
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:40,180
THAT WASN'T BRIAN'S INTERVIEW.

130
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:42,649
THAT WAS ANDERSON COOPER.

131
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,619
FOR BRIAN TO MAKE HIMSELF

132
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,353
IMPORTANT, HE'S BASICALLY SAYING

133
00:03:46,354 --> 00:03:47,421
I AM A VICTIM.

134
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:49,223
I AM A VICTIM OF TRUMP.

135
00:03:49,224 --> 00:03:50,457
IT'S A HATE MOVEMENT.

136
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,793
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, WHAT IT IS,

137
00:03:52,794 --> 00:03:53,527
WHAT IS OUR PEOPLE TUNING IN TO

138
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:55,529
WATCH THE MAN THAT HAS ALLOWED

139
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,697
YOU AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE TO

140
00:03:56,698 --> 00:03:58,999
KEEP THEIR JOBS.

141
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,804
>> Jesse: HEAR, HEAR.

142
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:06,006
THE GREAT EXAMPLE OF MEDIA BIAS.

143
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:08,342
IF THE TOP ON BONDSMAN AT CNN IS

144
00:04:08,343 --> 00:04:10,644
LYING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT BEING

145
00:04:10,645 --> 00:04:12,446
GOOD FOR RATINGS, WHAT ELSE IS

146
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:13,847
HE LYING ABOUT?

147
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:15,115
THEY WON'T GIVE TRUMP CREDIT FOR

148
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:16,717
THE RATINGS BUMP AND THAT'S WHY

149
00:04:16,718 --> 00:04:18,452
THEY DON'T GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR

150
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:21,621
THE ECONOMY, ISIS, NORTH KOREA.

151
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:23,157
CNN'S RATINGS HAVE RIDDEN HIGH

152
00:04:23,158 --> 00:04:24,358
ON THE TRUMP BUMP BUT THERE IS

153
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:26,760
STILL -- THEY ARE STILL GETTING

154
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:28,462
BEAT BY THE CARTOON NETWORK AND

155
00:04:28,463 --> 00:04:29,296
HOUSE FLIPPING SHOWS.

156
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:31,498
A LOT OF THAT HAS BEEN CAUSED BY

157
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:33,033
TRUMP BRANDING THEM AS FAKE NEWS

158
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:34,835
BUT THEY'VE ALSO HAD A LOT OF

159
00:04:34,836 --> 00:04:35,436
SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS.

160
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:37,070
THEY HAVE HAD TO MAKE MASSIVE

161
00:04:37,071 --> 00:04:37,504
RETRACTIONS.

162
00:04:37,505 --> 00:04:40,007
THEY HAVE RIDICULOUS CHIRON'S.

163
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:41,708
YOU CAN SEE THE HATE DRIPPING

164
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:43,143
OFF THE FACES OF SOME OTHER

165
00:04:43,144 --> 00:04:43,644
ANCHORS.

166
00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:45,245
THEY HAVE HAD TO FIRE WHOLE

167
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:46,213
CLASSES OF PEOPLE AND I'VE HAD

168
00:04:46,214 --> 00:04:48,382
DEMOCRATS MOVED ME AND SAY YOU

169
00:04:48,383 --> 00:04:50,451
KNOW WHAT, I'M A DEMOCRAT.

170
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:51,351
CAN'T STAND TRUMP.

171
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:52,219
I HATE TRUMP BUT I DON'T WATCH

172
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,590
CNN CNN BECAUSE EVEN CNN IS TOO

173
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:56,890
CRAZY.

174
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:58,592
>> Dana: I WAS GOING TO SAY

175
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:00,060
THE DIFFERENCE WITH FOX NEWS IS

176
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:01,628
THAT IF HILLARY HAD WON, OR

177
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:05,065
RATINGS WOULD STILL BE GOOD.

178
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:05,432
[LAUGHTER]

179
00:05:05,433 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Juan: MIGHT BE BETTER, IN
