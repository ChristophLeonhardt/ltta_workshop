the Republicans responded to the new information about possible sexual assault alleged sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh by releasing a letter of their own this is a letter prepared by women speaking in support of Brett Kavanaugh Chuck Grassley the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee release it with 65 women who mostly attended all-girls high schools around Georgetown Prep and have known Kavanaugh for more than three decades we're not gonna read the entirety of the letter but we will read the bulk of it we are women who have known Brett Kavanaugh for more than 35 years and knew him while he attended high school between 79 and 83 for the entire time we have known Kavanagh he has behaved honorably and treated women with respect we strongly believe it is important to convey this information to the committee at this time they went on to say that Cavanaugh has stood out for his friendship character and integrity in particular he's always treated women with decency and respect and that many of them have remained friends with the judge over the past 35 years they also point out that he was a good student and a good athlete so there's a bunch of stuff that has nothing to do with whether or not he might have sexually assaulted someone but this does always happen when these allegations come out so I guess we can't be too surprised that was amazingly fast yeah write that it's amazing how quickly he found 65 women to sign on to this letter I don't know I just find that strange I have to say I graduated from high school ten years ago and there is no way that I could think of 65 people period yes remember my name seems totally ridiculous so full context here number one it's 65 people overall over the course of 35 years some of whom know him back in high school and I think it is relevant to have women come forward and say no that's not our experience with them as they did with Al Franken mm-hmm but it does not prove the case at all so you could be decent to a lot of different women but sexually assault another one and so this in that sense John is right that it doesn't prove that he's innocent of this however much weight you want to give it that's up to you okay that the other women have had positive experience with them to Anna's point that's the most interesting one so how in the world did they find all these people in a day and a half or maybe just even one day now there's somebody on Twitter who said I signed the later a letter and I learned of it last night maybe it was the quickest thing job and that they've ever done or obviously the other possibility is Cavanaugh had told them about the incident so they knew that it might come out that's why they went back and found people women that knew him back in high school and had this letter prepared to go in case this came out if that's the case that makes me lean against Cavanaugh in a big big way cuz he knows he did it and he knows it might be a huge issue I can't I can't stop thinking about how aggressively Mitch McConnell tried to dissuade Trump from choosing cabin I think it would be impossible to get him through the process because of documentation right so let me just jump in on that because yeah so there's a lot of documentation and like we've seen you know his writings his decisions all of that stuff some of which was controversial for people on the left I guess but nothing really out of the nor ordinary nothing nothing out of the ordinary compared to other Supreme Court nominees so I thought it was strange of like oh man these documents are gonna come out we're gonna find some shady stuff no standard conservative stuff there wasn't anything really that stood out to me so I kept wondering what was Mitch McConnell so afraid of I feel like something's about to drop when is it gonna happen and nothing really came out of his rulings or his decisions but this came out and then you have this super fast response from you know Republican senators 65 people do you know he's signing onto this letter about his character about Cavanaugh's character it all seems very strange to me ya know Anna that is such a good point so I I think they might have screwed up here by releasing the letter in one day I know they wanted to try to get ahead of this like into the cycle and try to slow down etc but I hadn't thought of it the way that Anna pointed out McConnell was worried about documents documents really I mean a Republican worried about oh there's gonna be too much to read Denikin I don't care about that they said a bully people and and and roll past them so a really interesting question today is what did the Republicans senators know and when do they know it yeah mm-hmm I also kind of want to mention this this thing that's been on my mind the entirety of the Kavanagh confirmation process is that there are still Democrats there's still Democratic senators who have telegraphed that they will vote to confirm him and it's crazy to me it's absolutely I mean when it comes down to these people and it's always by the way it's always the same Democratic senators who vote for Republican interests it's the same ones who voted to confirm Gina Haspel it's the same ones who voted to confirm gorsek it's it's the same people and at that point I'm kind of thinking don't we just have Republicans in positions of power in the Democratic Party isn't that what's actually going on because if all the Republicans in lockstep are voting for a terrible person to be in the Supreme Court and then you some Democrats can't get the same lockstep even as a minority yeah what's going on well I mean there's incredible solidarity when it comes to Republicans which is the reason why everyone freaked out when John McCain voted against you know repealing the Affordable Care Act it was it was a rare thing you don't see that with Republicans with Democrats on the other hand I mean you see them caving to Republican interests all the time all the time yeah and by the way like that what they would say is or what I hear is oh they're they're worried but like if they vote against him like what about like the campaign that's reelection yeah lot lots of ads going out like he voted against this guy you probably never heard of that's really gonna hurt him by the way oh he didn't give Donald Trump the guy with a 36 percent approval rating they didn't give him the court the judge he wanted yeah that's ridiculous it seems more likely that they kind of want him it's also incredibly frustrating to see Democrats attacking people who are further on the left then these people who are so far on the right within the same party you know you constantly see these attacks on Bernie or on Alexandria Acacio cortes but I never hear people attack like Joe Manchin or there's a Heidi Heitkamp like like they just you know people say well yeah they're in red states so that's what they but Bernie he's he's ruining the Democratic but I mean it's yeah it doesn't make any sense I can't believe I'm about to be fair to people I can't stand politically like Kavanaugh and Manchin but in this case now about Manchin to be fair though we can't say they don't do anything Democratic because they also voted with Affordable Care Act so the reason McCain's vote mattered is because Manchin and the other guys held so I'm just giving you full context but it does drive me crazy when they vote for Gorsuch and and it's still considering voting for Kavanagh because even if you are not moved by these latest allegations it doesn't matter Cavanaugh is still terrible on everything else he's Pro citizens united against Roe vs. Wade that no Democrat in their right mind should vote for them so it's deeply deeply frustrating thanks for watching this free clip of The
