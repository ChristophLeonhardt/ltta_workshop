today the Sun September 11th the day when we pause to remember the events that took place in New York City 17 years ago but since we don't want to say anything politically incorrect or anything that might offend anyone we all want to be very careful about how we commemorate a day that was perhaps not as optimal as other days for reasons that maybe we shouldn't go into in too much detail it's very important on a day like this that we don't stir up any prejudices or irrational phobias against people just because they happen to slaughter thousands of innocent Americans without warning after all maybe they were responding to America's many historical sins like our belligerent insistence on putting our buildings where they happen to want to fly their hijacked planes I'm sure they acted for reasons that seem perfectly valid in their culture even if in our culture there might seem to be the very definition of homicidal insanity not that there's anything wrong with homicidal insanity if that's part of their culture which obviously it is and yes the people from this perfectly valid homicidally insane culture may have believed in a different religion than most of us but who's to say that the way we worship God by singing hymns and praying isn't some sense better than the way they worship God by slaughtering innocent people on mosque after all our national philosophy prizes freedom and equality so we must respect the freedom and equality of people who don't prize freedom and equality and who are willing to kill every one of us until the question is settled and we can all live together in peace except for those of us who've been killed so this September 11th let's all remember not to remember what we remember unless we remember something truly offensive something truly politically incorrect something truly pro-american namely the truth trigger warning am andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show welcome to the Andrew Clavin show broadcasting live from the Regan ranch Center in Santa Barbara if you're watching you can see many pictures gigantic pictures of Ronald Reagan around me which are making me feel kind of insignificant even a little more insignificant than when ben shapiro leans in my studio every morning and shouts you're insignificant but but but so it's somehow the reckon is worse and i'm happy to be here we're going to commemorate 9/11 first i have to pay the rent by talking about 23andme which is i have now used 23andme i haven't got my results back yet I'm kind of enjoying this part you know you're spitting it too when you send it in to get your genetic information and I'm kind of enjoying this part because I can have all kinds of expectations like I'm hoping that I'm actually like one of the very few people of Jewish heritage who is part Cherokee you know that didn't that didn't happen a lot you know and then I can join Elizabeth Warren or her tribe Walzer flies like a dog and getting my my Indian name as well which would be something like shines like the moon possibly I don't know but it really is it really is good you can get things like DNA can tell you play a role in determining your food preferences you can find out the bitter taste report whether you prefer sweet or salty the deep sleep report tells you if you are more likely to be an especially deep sleeper which I I can already guess on mind since I haven't slept since 1972 the saturated fat and weight report tells you based on your genetics how your weight might be affected by saturated fats in your diet all kinds of fascinating information so I'm really eager to find out you can order your 23andme health and ancestry service kit at 23andme dot-com slash Clavin that's the number 23andme am DME dot-com slash Clavin and of course in the report it will tell you how to use Clavin which is KLA VA n-no E's there is no ease in Clavin I just I just make it look easy that's all there is to it all right so I was out I don't know how many of you guys were out there was a very very moving ceremony out on the beach in Santa Barbara by a young American young America's Foundation which runs the Reagan ranch center and I gave a few remarks which was very difficult because before I gave these remarks they had bagpipe playing which was just absolutely heartbreaking I was afraid I was gonna get up and sob for five minutes but I managed to push through and I was I was talking about some of the things from that we wanted to remember about 9/11 because because we're hearing a lot of things from people like we shouldn't talk about it in Slate a college professor today said we don't need to memorialize 9/11 these students have enough on their minds without that sitting around just worrying about things that happen before their lifetime Joe Scarborough today wrote he wrote an article in The Washington Post just read the headline Trump is damaging the dream of America more than any terrorist attack ever could so so they you can tell that people on the Left are sort of seizing this moment to sink as low as they possibly can it's kind of making this an unimportant day but it's not it's not an unimportant day and remembering things is not unimportant I was thinking as I was speaking this morning about Lincoln's first inaugural address when days you know there there can be many arguments about who was the greatest American president but there can be no argument about who was the greatest writer who was American president was Abraham Lincoln and in his first inaugural address he was begging begging the South not to start not to pull away from America not to start a civil war and at the end he said we are not enemies but friends we must not be enemies though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and Patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature to such beautiful language the mystic cords being played by our better angels the mystic chords of memory are in fact very mysterious I mean memory is what makes us who we are it's how we know that we're the same person we were yesterday it's how we build a picture of our personality from the moment were born until the day we die and I think it is true just not just of individuals it's true of our nation and that's why I think it's so important the guy's like this professor writing in Slate saying we shouldn't remember things I travel around with the after different colleges and I find a lot of kids are being taught a nothing they're being taught nothing about our how our government works about where it comes from but why we think the things we do why we believe the things we do old you know they're also being told histories that emphasize the worst things about this country I mean that the bad things that happened in this country as they have in all country and I always tell them that that is if I told your biography starting with your porn searches online you know that so you always need to say who who is who is Bob well let me tell you this because this will really grab you and by the time I'm finished you think he's a horrible person when he really is it's really not the bad things that we all do it's the good things we do in this country has transformed the world for the better there is not a single person politically free walking on the earth who does not owe a debt of gratitude to America I mean that is just mathematical fact that we we have really freed the world and taught the world what freedom means all these people making speeches in the Europe about how their multicultural countries which they're not got that from us I mean they they are imitating us even the Soviet Union a slave state felt compelled to call themselves the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics because everybody knew that we had gotten it right except us because we were admiring the USSR we were saying oh yes that's that's wonderful so these memories remind us who we are and I want to talk a little bit about my own memories of 9/11 and three things I learned from 9/11 and you may be surprised to hear that some of these are a little politically incorrect but when 9/11 happened I have only been back in this country a year I had left to go to England for a year and had stayed for seven years so I was an expatriate and I had got had this tremendous experience living overseas for seven years a long time which was kind of like when the astronauts went to the moon and they took that picture of Earth and they saw it at a distance and so for six-and-a-half of the seven years all I paid attention to was English politics that's all I knew like new English people read English news was involved in English politics Bill Clinton scandals were going on and of course I that was part of the English news so I knew about it but I wasn't in the country for any of that and when I came back and I moved here to Santa Barbara I found that my opinions had changed and as a guy who'd grown up in a liberal Democrat family we're Republicans there were Republicans and then there were Nazis and the that separation was like this you know that was that was really the way for a Republican got elected president my father was packing gold bars into a suitcase so he could bribe his way through the border to Canada and and so I came back and to my shock I found that the people who were saying what I was saying in America were rush limbaugh the guys at the corner and National Review not it seems these evils conservatives were saying what I thought had learned to be true about America from seeing it from very far away and then I was here one year I guess and 9/11 happened and I remember waking up and you have to understand my entire family lives on the island of Manhattan now one of them has moved to the Bronx but they all are New Yorkers and they've all lived in Manhattan all their lives and so I wake up 3,000 miles away and I hear that a plane has gone in to a built into the world traits and the first thing I thought of was I remembered i hearing reading that in 1945 a military plane had crashed accidentally into the Empire State Building his wife that was the picture in my mind when I turned on the TV and saw what what had really happened and of course I started calling my family and one by one had three brothers and my father and mother and I remember my father who's now gone but at the time he was he was sobbing and I will tell you that the one thing you never want to hear in this life is your father sobbing you do not want to hear that sound and and I remember you know he thought this is war we're now at war and I remember saying to him it's not gonna be a big war like World War two it's gonna be a lot of little wars because there's no nation to fight it's this we're fighting this philosophy were fighting a philosophy and that was the first lesson that was the first lesson I remember is that we're fighting a philosophy and so much of human life is about philosophy so much of history is about ideas of battle over ideas and that was why it was my last stage and becoming an actual open conservative I was already a conservative but this was my last stage and acknowledging it because I saw liberals asking the question I remember David Letterman going on TV after this happened and asking the question why do they hate us now I've worked on volunteered on a lot of suicide hotlines on a couple of suicide hotlines and every now and again you speak to a wife whose husband is violent and who hits her and a lot of times the woman will say to you what am I doing wrong why why what can I do didn't stop them from hitting me and of course I wasn't allowed to skip my answer was shoot him you know that'll stop I'll stop him you know so so like when I heard David Letterman say why do they hate us my first reaction was let's kill him and see if that solves the problem you know that would be the fastest thing to do because they're not acting because of us that's demeaning to our enemies it's demeaning to our enemies to think that we have some power to make them change their minds we don't we don't they are grown-up adults just like us and they're acting on their ideas as we are acting on our ideas and that's why that is why when I was working in the movie business at the time and selling a lot of scripts and write I write mysteries and ghost stories but that's why when I saw Hollywood start to turn out these films in which our soldiers were depicted as rapists and killers and idiots who were being abused by evil Republicans and sent in to ward where they were risking their lives for nothing that's why I became an outspoken conservative ending effectively ending my Hollywood career because I realized meet a culture is where we store these ideas that are our lived ideas our movies you know not only that I think it was wrong to make anti-american films while our guys were at war which was the real reason that stuff that made me so angry I started speaking out also this is the way these films last forever these films last forever they're on at 3 o'clock in the morning and this is the way young people will remember these things and that's why I was so glad when American sniper came out and told an honest version of the story not that we were perfect but thankfully this is not about the fact that we're better people than they are it's the fact that bad ideas make cultures bad bad ideas make people do horrible things and good ideas in a noble people and lift them up so that's the first thing that I learned I have to pause for a minute once again not to keep your lights on but they keep our lights on at the Daily wire and talk about stamps.com and stamps calm is absolutely great I personally I'm still I'm old enough so when I put a nom below in my computer and it comes out with a stamp on it in my printer and it comes out with a stamp on it I'm kind of like oh that is cool because you don't have to drive to the post office the post office terrific but this will put all the amazing services of the post office right into your desk 24/7 where it's convenient for you you can buy and print official US postage for any letter any package using your own computer and printer and the mail carrier picks it up just click print mail and you are done it couldn't be easier right now use the code Clavin once again for this special offer it includes up to fifty five dollars free postage a digital scale and a four week trial do not wait go to stamps calm before you do anything else click on the radio microphone at the top of the homepage and type in Clavin aha but how do you spell Clavin is que la VA and that's stamps.com enter Clavin the second lesson I learned is this and here's what we get into stings that make you uncomfortable make some people uncomfortable religion matters even if your religion is atheism you know elites and intellectuals were shocked at 9/11 that anybody could be so primitive as to care enough about God through commit us active suicide killing it had been happening all around them but they couldn't believe it they thought they thought that in the natural order of things we were all going to grow out of this primitive idea that there's some big bearded man up in the sky you know running things and how oh my goodness what a silly thing that you would think about us this 911 happened before I became a Christian but already I had come to understand that there must be a God if everything if all the logic of life but it was to work itself out and make sense I had begun to believe in God but I hadn't become a Christian yet and when I watched this I thought what culture what nation what people has not been shaped at the deepest deepest level by its concept of who God is I mean when we say that we hold these truths to be self-evident that we are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights that implies an idea of a creator that implies an idea of what the Creator wants I'll tell you something the people who flew those planes into those buildings and into the Pentagon and who tried to fly it into other buildings in Washington they I agree on one thing they and I agree on one thing we agree on the idea that the government is meant to enforce the will of God they think the will of God is that you should be slaves I think it's you you should be free and that the government is there to ensure that you are free to ensure the rights God gave you are put in place there's no getting out of that there's no getting out of that conflict I mean that is a conflict in two ways of looking at the world and when you point out to people who are so advanced and have gotten so far in their intellectual journey that they realize this god stuff is all primitive nonsense and you say well what about what about the Communists the Communists in China and in Russia enforced atheism and slaughtered more people in about 20 minutes then all the religious wars on earth had ever slaughtered anybody right their answer is always sam Harris a big atheist guy says this well communism is religion too communism is related to it but communism is not a religion communism is not a religion atheism is the religion of communism and it must be because it is completely a materialist way of thought so you know when you look at people who are atheists that is also a religion is a way of confronting the unknown the eternal your creation now I read a lot of scientific books and a lot of scientific books that come out now put forward the idea that science has taken us beyond the idea of God and that has consequences let me read you a book it's called read you a little portion of a book called sapiens a little portion of an interview with the author you've all Ferrari sapiens is a huge bestseller Bill Gates thinks it's the most brilliant thing ever and it's all about the fact that we are human beings because we tell these fictions untrue stories and they bind us together and Harare says if you think about human rights human rights are a fictional story just like God and heaven they are not a biological reality biologically speaking humans don't have rights if you take Homo sapiens and look inside you find the heart and the kidneys and the DNA you don't find any rights the only place rights exist is in the stories that people have been inventing if you don't believe in God that is absolutely right that is absolutely true but I am a fiction writer I'm a writer of stories and stories are not about are not made-up there are ways of communicating truths that you can't say in any other way we all do it we all use metaphors to say you know what was it like to pitch a no-hitter you say well it's like waking up on Christmas morning because there's no words there's no words to say what it's like what the experience of being a human being is like so we write stories and we use art to communicate these things so when you write a story the question is is the story true is the story true and that is the question that you Valerie doesn't have to ask but if we lived in Yuval Ferraris word world where human rights were a fiction how hard is it to guess how hard is it to guess what that world is gonna look like about ten seconds after it's founded right because how do you defend your rights how do you defend your rights if they're just a fiction he has a better fiction his fiction is that the world is going to end through climate change and so you have to give up your rights now his fiction is something else the question is not whether we are telling stories of course we're telling stories there's no way to communicate the essential facts of life without telling stories but are the stories true and that is really the question we're asking Ferraris religion is atheism so is Steven Pinker and other science writer that I like and so he thinks our rights are fiction but I believe and I think you know I don't have to quote the Bible I in a God who made us in His image and wants us to be free and I don't have to quote the Bible to prove that because I think all of nature cries it out all of the human heart cries it out so the objection to this the thing that makes people so upset when you start talking about religion is they say well wait wait are we gonna have holy wars are we gonna have holy wars is that we're gonna go back to the world of holy wars I remember I was judging a journalistic contest and I was on the phone with other journalists who were also judges in this contest and somebody's one of these women a very big I won't give her away but it was a very big journalist and she said I heard that George W Bush prayed before he went into Iraq so this is just a holy war he's no better than bin Laden you know bin Laden prays to his god and George W Bush prays to his God what's the difference well that's a good question what's the difference if the difference is our God wants us to be free and their God wants to enslave us difference so I never want to attack anybody because of his religion not anybody I never wanted to fight with anybody because of his religion but if somebody attacks me because of his gun I do want to fight back and I do want to fight back in the knowledge that freedom is better than slavery why is freedom better than slavery because we are created beings with god-given rights and the third one and you're gonna love this one the third lesson I got from 9/11 is that men must be men or the world comes crashing down now whenever you speak in praise of manhood now there's always somebody who says well a woman could do that and here's my answer no she couldn't a woman could do it but if abandoned their posts if men abandoned the rules of manhood which require bravery which require sacrifice which requires standing up for the women in our lives the world comes crashing down and this is a good time to stop for a minute and remember the men of 911 the firefighters and police and this is something I can barely keep in my head who charged into the buildings as they were crumbling to get people out without men like that the world comes tumbling down I want to remember I should remember the engine 54 ladder 4 battalion 9 in Midtown lost 15 men 15 min ok I mean the engine companies are not that big you visited I don't know if you've been to New York anywhere even in big city they're not that big 15 men is a huge huge number talk about Tom Burnett mark Bingham Jeremy Glick and Todd Beamer who took back United 93 and drove it into the ground before could reach where they what they think it was I think it was DC what made those guys so American such American men it's not that they had courage all kinds of people have courage but that they broke the rules when new information came in that was an incredibly American thing to do the rules the thing that people were trained to do when a plane was hijacked was to let the hijackers do what they want they were just gonna fly to Miami Park the plane you know get their ransom or whatever and let everybody go so there was no point in fighting back and getting killed but one of these guys Tom Burnett was on the phone with his wife Deena and she said that's not what's happening there the hijacking planes all over the crashing him at the buildings and they decided that if they were going to take back the plane an amazing act of courage without men like that the world comes crashing down I mean I could go through so many but I also want to mention Chris Stevens and Shawn Smith and Glen Doherty and Tyrone woods who died 9/11 2012 in Benghazi you know these are these ideas that we hold these ideas that come from our God because of these ideas there's certain things you can't have if you want people to be free you can't be equal because if you're free you're gonna be better at something than me maybe I'll be better something than you if you're free people are gonna rise a different level so you can't be equal you can't have equal outcomes but if you want to be free you can't be always at peace you have to fight sometimes because people want to enslave you that's a human nature people want to enslave you and some people want to give up their freedom because it's too much trouble without men to fight those battles without men to fight those battles you will not be free for long and the world will come crashing down and today and I'll talk about this later on at the end of the show because we've had a huge time in Hollywood we've had a huge bout of me too toxic masculinity but we hear all the time about toxic masculinity and believe me like I said I work in Hollywood I I see a lot of toxic masculinity alright but on 9/11 I think we should remember what real masculinity looks like and how much we owe it you know how much we owe to the men who fulfill the roles of men you know and I think that that is the third thing I took away from 9/11 we're not all soldiers we're not all firemen we're not all policemen we're not all heroes but I think that I do believe that each and every one of us have a little piece of this beautiful idea in our hands and we have to defend it with all the courage we have no matter how they shout at us no matter what they have they scream in us and I think ultimately that there's going to have to be a balance of men who stand for these things and hold them up because that's the only way that they'll survive so that is what I take away from 9/11 in the end you know we can't remember pain it's a really interesting thing about the human mind we can't remember pain if we could actually remember pain no woman would ever have a second child I mean you forget you forget how bad it is and you go back into the fray and because we can't remember pain all of history eventually becomes literature that means all of history eventually becomes a story that we tell and we have to tell that story and we have to tell it truthfully and we have to remember because there are always people willing to tell stories that aren't true stories that promote bad value stories that promote bad ideas and we stand on a tower of great ideas and as I said it my speech this morning that tower is still standing we have to never let it fall Ben sue brown is young America's Foundation spokesman he routinely travels to colleges and universities to manage some contentious situations you've traveled with mr. Shapiro have ya and yet here he is alive to tell his story he helps out the gap students around the country and he is also an opinion contributor for the hill I did not know that thank you so when you look at this culture when you hear someone like the professor at rip on university saying we don't need to remember 9/11 and you've seen so much around the country what do you think what is your response then well I think the first thing to look at is just how bad higher education has got when this is a professor at Ripon College who's basically telling students they don't need to learn anymore because it's something that happened before they were born and obviously that's sort of the form that yes 911 never forget project has taken on now we started in 2003 in order to sort of push back on the left's attempt to make it a politically correct sanitized remembrance that you talked about but now you know students high school freshmen especially they weren't alive when 9/11 happened college freshman a lot of college students today have no memory of that day I was only in second grade when it happened so even my memories you know are hazy at this point but when you look at professors who are saying we don't need to remember bad events in history because they happened before we were alive you know where does that stop is he gonna stop teaching about the Holocaust because it happened before he was alive he's gonna stop teaching you know about anything where does the line fall then once you start trying to censor history in a way that it basically protects this fragile leftist ideology it is the ideology I mean one of the things I remember on 9/11 is thinking well there goes multiculturalism but they cling to it like this a stone basic absolutely multiculturalism but not you know any sort of ideological diversity they're all about certain kinds of diversity but what I see especially you know in all these college campuses if you're conservative you don't have rights when you walk through the door and obviously that's unconstitutional and the grounds for several lawsuits EF has right now but it's something that you know we continue to push back on but the left is not using up especially in the age of Trump so when I go for Yahoo I talk at the universities I see these young people you cannot I mean if you ever want to feel like hopeful you look at these young people they're so smart so bright so brave but talk about a little bit of what you see them facing as on a day to day basis yeah it's I think most people would be surprised you know the media somewhat to their credit has started to cover these situations and it's part of my job as the spokesman that you have to make sure that people understand what it's actually like to be a conservative on these campuses but it takes so many different forms depending on the school you know at some schools it is the students who are so intolerant and so you'll have them you know anytime young Americans for freedom chapter tries to table on their campus and pass out for example pocket constitutions the students will run over and tell them you know this is inappropriate behavior this is triggering to me I don't like this document because it was written you know far too long ago by racist slaveholding white men and all these things and then other times you know sort of more nefariously there's this anti conservative bias that's sort of institutionalized in higher education today and so you see these schools whether it be UC Berkeley or the University of Wisconsin at Madison University of Connecticut where they use the bureaucracy of the administration in order to shut down conservatives through preventing them from using rooms you know telling them that they can't speak in a certain venue at a certain time of day because they don't want conservatives on campus after dark because that would be dangerous that's what Berkeley initially told us when we were working to bring Ben Shapiro there and so they just sort of used this multi-pronged approach in order to make it so that way conservatives don't have a voice on their campus because again you know what we find on these campuses one yeah is able to bring in one of these speakers there are a lot more conservatives than you think exist they're just sometimes so suppressed that they just feel like it's useless for them to even get out and be active for a while it seems to me I mean Shapiro went faced virtual riots I mean he was really surrounded by violent people some of these Antipa people are really dangerous and yet from a distance at least it seems a little bit this is calm down is that a fair to say I think it's interesting right now sure just coming back into the school year so over the summer things sort of calm down just because there's nothing happening on campuses but you know already kicking off this year we had Ripon College you know told the students there who are doing the 9/11 never forget project today one of more than 200 schools doing the project but they told them that the never forget posters we have which if you're familiar with them they have a photo of the twin towers that are burning they have photos of other attacks carried out by radical Islamic terrorists and the school said that these are inappropriate posters because they're you know just only singling out this one religion and so they told the students the the body that held hell this meeting is called the biased protocol board which just sounds like hell to go into a meeting with them but they basically told these students you know that if you're going to single out one religion these constitute bias and they're not welcome on our campus and so they said things like the Iran hostage crisis was not you know related to Islam at all they said that they didn't think the pulse nightclub shooting was something that should be included because it means more to the LGBT community and so by using it on their post or the app chapter sort of appropriating LGBT culture and they just run through all these weird objections to try to tell students you know that what you're doing is either stupid or useless or at worst you know offensive and harmful and so you have to push back against it and they mentioned being bold needing you know people to stand up and what we find is when students are standing when they stand up and are bold advocates for conservatism that usually are able to win the day it is amazing the way they strip Islamic Islamist terrorists of their their own personal motives that I mean the guy who shot up then the gay nightclub was on the phone with police saying I'm doing this for Isis I'm doing you know I'm doing this so that's that was his statement and yet then we see guys people who write from the New York Times actually explaining no no that's not why it is when you when you go and do you go in and have conversations with things like this Orwellian board it kind of depends a lot of times you know it's the students we're on the front lines so they're really the real brave ones because every single day they try to stand up and hand out a constitution or god forbid a Bible or whatever it may be I know they're the ones who get the brunt of this assault from the left on campuses but from time to time you know when it comes to these campus lectures I travel to a lot of them to help make sure that our stories getting out there because often the press will try to you know carry water for the leftist administration and whatever else and so I'll go in and say you know this is ridiculous what's happening I had to do that at Berkeley I had a little kind of gorilla press conference on the steps of one of the buildings there because the the school's chancellor had called a secret press conference to try to throw us under the bus and say that how dare we cause them to spend six hundred thousand dollars and bring in seven hundred police officers to which I held my little press conference and says how dare you have a college or a university where your students can't handle opposing ideas this is ridiculous this is all your fault it's not our fault the other students need Plato and a puppy in order to have Ben Shapiro somewhere in the vicinity and so when it comes to fair all Sony play don't have puppy battle but it's just you know when you talk to these administrators they just think it's so beyond the pale that there would be a conservative who dares to want to speak on their campus and that you would try to bring in a different viewpoint because for them they need their echo chamber because as you see where for conservative ideas expressed the leftists kind of have to question what they're saying because it's not based in fact it's not based in history and I think that's why we see them trying to just erase history that's sort of the inconvenient truth well at any point I mean these are theoretically intellectuals used to people dedicated to thought and dedicated to teaching have you ever encountered anybody on on these campus administration because I'm appalled that the administration would be a part of this it's one thing to have radical students we've always had those but to have anybody in the administration shut down speech do you ever meet people who sort of are willing to talk it out or actually receptive to what you're saying every now and then there are a few closeted conservatives who will come up to me who are in the administration or somebody will come up and very quietly sort of pull me aside at an event this happened at the University of Utah last year and pulled me over to the side and just sort of quietly said like just so you know we have your back but I can't make a statement supporting your right to be here because if I do the students will revolt but what about a leftist who says well let's sit down and reason together that's very rare I think I have there is one one event we held actually at Berkeley last spring where Dennis Prager spoke with three different leftist students there who were able to agree to sit down with him and just have an honest frank conversation on a stage in front of you know a packed house talking about you know what you think about free speech why do you think you know conservatives are so mistreated here all these things and it was I think kind of unfair for the leftist students because they're going up against you know Dennis Prager who has a career of doing this and they're just students in college trying to figure everything out but it was interesting to see that when there is an open exchange of ideas you know there were points of agreement on both sides but oftentimes you know the left doesn't want to concede that and more often than not we warn our students against people saying you know like let's have a conversation about it because typically the left that's sort of one of their dirty tricks as they say like okay you want to bring you know Andrew Cleveland and to speak we think in order to better serve the students we need to have a counterpoint present as well so they would force this try to force the students to have a leftist on stage with you to sort of you know couch all of everything you say with what they want to have said and so they we warned against the word you know conversation dialogue because on the left it doesn't mean actual conversation or dialogue it means we tell you what you're gonna say and you quietly kind of go in the corner Wow because I have to say that sometimes talking to left-wing students when I challenge their ideas they actually start to breathe rapidly I'm not joking they breathe rapidly and their eyes start blinking vert as if you had awakened them from I think that's called triggering and three guys actually freaking yeah I was wondering what that was you know I say that all the time so since you have you have a lot of experience doing this at this point what are the things that keep you up at night what are the things that you were afraid the bad trends that you see I think one of the really scary trends is schools who are unafraid of being held accountable at this point where we had for a while there were schools where if you were to send a demand letter if they were trying to prevent a conservatives from speaking in a venue or something we would send a demand letter they would realize they were about to violate the Constitution and would make amends and now we see schools becoming more bold partially at the administrative level because they're so afraid of their students because I've seen what students do when they're conservatives speak at CSULA the leftist students will go camp out in the president's office for three days and have a hunger strike in the office until he recants and says you know I'm sorry we shouldn't have had a conservative at this school and so I think people being unafraid of the fact that the Constitution is there and binds their activities is something that's alarming and it becomes a really big issue where we've been engaged in this lawsuit against UC Berkeley over their treatment of Shapiro and other conservatives for almost two years now and so the schools know that they can drag out these lawsuits because especially with UC Berkeley it's all taxpayer money and everybody knows California can tax until you know the literally bankrupt the state and so you have these situations where they are just trying to delay basically due process for conservatives and that's something that's alarming because it gets you in a place where you can't bring it conservative and well this lawsuit is going on because they won't make amends for what they've done um I think the other really concerning thing is students who are just becoming everybody always used as a snowflake metaphor you know these students are so fragile but I think what we're seeing as students sort of adopting the Trump derangement syndrome side of things and not just being fragile but also becoming just outwardly violent and taking it out on conservative students where we see more threats against conservative students we see more conservative students being sort of almost assaulted I don't know if assault is the right word that might be a little too strong but we do see them being less drawing away from the situations where there are conservatives and more trying to be active in suppressing conservatives Wow and what about if there is a positive side to this do you see any positive trends I would say so absolutely you know everyday it's pretty much a rare day where I don't get a phone call from a student on some campus saying like hey this just happened what do we do how do we fix this and so we have three young America's Foundation we have our young Americans for freedom chapters was founded by Buckley back in the 1960 you know so this is an organization with all this history and even today these students are the bold people who are standing up for true conservatism on their campuses and I think anywhere you look where there's good stuff happening you know today across the country more than 200 high schools and colleges these yappers are setting up 2,977 flights to make sure that even if their school doesn't want the truth of today to be heard they're bringing their school together to remind their peers what happened today so I think all you have to do is look at that and that is honestly the greatest part of my job is giving to the conservative movement you know hopefully some optimism that the rising generation is conservative or ideas are applicable to them and they're loved conservative ideas it's just they never get the chance to hear them because of these suppressions that are put on them by these leftists do you think these kids have effects on other kids like you know do you think they're student I know there are not adults on the Left who are willing to talk about other students on the left who were willing to absolutely and I don't even think they go into it thinking that they're gonna be you know acceptable or perceptive to hearing the other eyes other side but a prime example actually when Ben spoke at California State University Los Angeles and it basically descended into riots and you had Molina Abdullah and people you know we had a professor threatening to fight our students asking do you lift bro just absolutely ridiculous stuff going on there but there were students who showed up to protest that lecture that ultimately went on but was just crazy they pulled the fire alarm everything else but there were students who showed up to protest who today are some of the most active members of the yeah after on that campus who are now out there trying to introduce their peers so the same ideas that literally change their lives and so you see you know in that totally chaotic day that led to a lawsuit and everything and you know we had to sneak students in three at a time through a back door with the police escort just to get them in a room to hear ben shapiro but the people who are outside screaming about him being a fascist are now the ones working to bring in conservatives to their other peers that's a great story I think I'll end there that was terrific thank you very much Spencer Brown from young America's Foundation that's how about you sir you know there's a story out of the UK today UK police urged citizens to report neighbours for offensive speech when I lived in the UK one of the first things that happened to me very early on as I was invited to a dinner party and the fellow next to me said what is this with your First Amendment why do you fight where is it with your written constitution why do you have to write your Constitution down and I said because our politicians are so bad that if we don't write for the institution that they won't obey it they've even with it written down we have our diet keeping them in line so here's the story English police are now calling on citizens to report hate incidents reporting friends and neighbors to the police has terrible historical connotation this is from the Federalists and for good reason it's legitimate fascism the latest call for action in England is from the South Yorkshire Police on Twitter similar reporting requests are posted on the United Kingdom government website here it is this is from South Yorkshire Police hate can be any incident or crime motivated by prejudice or hostility or perceived to be so or perceived to be so against the person's race religion sexual orientation transgender identity or disability hate hurts and nobody should have to tolerate it report it and put a stop to it imagine that world which we are threatened with I think here too yeah imagine a world where if you feel that something I said has offended you I get a visit from the police and with that I think we will close or usually on Tuesday we close with sexual follies so now usually as you can tell from the can-can of music usually the sexual Follies thing is kind of funny this time it actually isn't you know les Moonves I don't know if you heard this this is a an earthquake in Hollywood I mean in an earthquake les Moonves Ryan CBS he took CBS from one of the least watched networks to being the lead Network for as long as he was there decades when you were at CBS you were doing one thing which was serving les Moonves and now two articles by Ronan Farrow the guy who started the home me to fuss with the Harvey Weinstein two articles by him in The New Yorker have brought forward charges against Moonves that he really violently abused women it in the place now obviously these he says they're not true so I don't know whether they're true or not but he did step down there was some talk that he is in a battle for control but wasn't a battle for control of CBS with Shari redstone who wanted to have a merger that he didn't want to have and so there was some talk that she had engineered all this but right now it looks very bad from him the thing that gets me about this and the thing that I just want to point out is a Hollywood guy a guy who's worked there is that Munez was famous for keeping his shows clean and basically based on good and evil at a time when TV was exploring darker ideas like The Sopranos and Breaking Bad and things like this his shows were CSI Miami CSI Blue Bloods one of the most conservative shows on television and it is just a reminder it's just a reminder I think to all of us that Hollywood is fake Hollywood his show I think people are your talent is blind all kinds of people get talent all kinds of people get ability good people bad people there's no telling anything but everything you see the people the stories people tell is Plato warned us long ago the stories people tell are sent to them by their gods the stories are sent by the gods but the people themselves are not elevated by the stories they tell and so the next time you see somebody get winning an Oscar and telling you you're an idiot because you voted for Donald Trump or if winning an Emmy and telling you you're an idiot your believe your religious belief or whatever just remember the stories they tell may be great the stories they tell are sent by God but the people themselves are no better than anyone else and frequently in Hollywood particularly frequently they're a whole lot worse anyway it has been great having you here I thank you so much for being an audience to this show at
