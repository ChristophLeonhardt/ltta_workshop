1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,080
Donald Trump’s new chief of staff could
not be more different than the president himself.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,900
Whereas Trump has presided over A White House
that has been roiled by chaos….

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,580
The problem with this is that we see changing
narratives.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,520
disorder

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,380
You can’t make up what’s going on!

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,390
and backstabbing.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,680
He’s a showboat.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,660
He’s a grandstander.

9
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:25,160
General John Kelly is known for his insistence
on discipline, order, and a stable chain of command.

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,420
While Trump never served in the military,
 he claims to have great respect for the generals.

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,540
And Kelly fits the bill.

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,200
He’s a retired four-star general with a
decorated 42-year military career.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,660
Kelly’s challenge is not only to bring order
to the White House, but to help Trump push

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,980
Trump’s agenda through and unruly Republican Congress

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,600
that has already defied the president on big issues like healthcare.

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,420
This is how a career soldier found himself
the gatekeeper to the most disorderly

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,020
White House in modern history.

18
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,480
John Francis Kelly was born on May 11, 1950
in Boston, Massachusetts into an Irish Catholic family.

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,580
At 16 he hitchhiked and hopped trains across
America until he joined the Merchant Marines.

20
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,439
Then, in 1970 he enlisted in the US Marine
Corps, seeking higher education.

21
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,630
He obtained a bachelor’s degree from University
of Massachusetts and a Master’s of Science

22
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,190
in National Security Studies from Georgetown.

23
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,640
After rising through the ranks of the military,
Kelly became a 4-star general, eventually

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,920
becoming head of the US Southern Command in 2012.

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,560
Perhaps his strongest suit is both his leadership
skills and the perception of his leadership skills.

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,920
That’s Margaret Talev.

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,540
I’m the White House Correspondent for Bloomberg
and I cover President Donald J. Trump.

28
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,880
On Jan 20, 2017, Trump tapped Kelly as Secretary
of Homeland Security.

29
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,140
In those very early months of the Trump Administration
General Kelly helped carry out and

30
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:55,820
defend his immigration policies with the travel ban, and with the president’s now infamous tweet accusing

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,439
President Obama of having tapped him at Trump Tower.

32
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,060
If the president of the United States said
that, he’s got his reasons.

33
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,660
And so president Trump came to see general
Kelly as supportive.

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,100
After leading the department for 6 months,
his tenure was cut short.

35
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,340
John Kelly was announced on a Friday in the
middle of a rain storm in Washington and his

36
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,340
John Kelly will do a fantastic job.

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,430
His first day on the job was Monday morning.

38
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,930
and Anthony Scaramucci was out!

39
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,670
It all happened really in the blink of an eye.

40
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:32,740
The message that he sent by dismissing Anthony Scaramucci so quickly on day one was unmistakable to everybody at the White House.

41
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,820
While keeping strict order and control in the White House is one of the main responsibilities

42
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:45,220
of the Chief of Staff,  it remains to be seen if Kelly has the political acumen to navigate the murky partisan waters of DC politics.

43
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,940
Unlike previous chiefs of staff, Kelly has
no experience playing politics, and has admitted

44
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,870
to having little patience for Capitol Hill.

45
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,580
If lawmakers do not like the laws that they have sworn to enforce,

46
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,290
then they should have the courage and the skill to change those laws.

47
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,320
Otherwise they should shut up and support
the men and women on the front lines.

48
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,300
Its only 6 months in but it’s been a very
rocky 6 months.

49
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,080
No. no.

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,700
Next question.

51
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,300
It’s his job to calm the waters, to get
the president and congress working together

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,780
so that he can execute the president’s mission.

53
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,020
Now his reputation thus far is being sort
of averse to that process, but look that hasn’t

54
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,440
been his job until now.

55
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,020
General Kelly will go down in terms of the position of Chief of Staff

56
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,940
One of the great ever.

57
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,800
Will Kelly be the first staff member to reign in and tame the Trump White House?

58
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,250
Or will he be pushed out or resign like so
many before him.

59
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,340
Whether they can actually coexist and provide
sort of a yin and a yang to one another is

60
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,820
really the question to be determined.

61
00:03:45,860 --> 00:00:00,000
The answer to that question will probably
hold the key to how successful John Kelly can be.
