hundreds killed thousands fleeing the country so is Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega facing a legitimate revolution or a violent coup I'm Mehdi Hasan with allegations of anti-semitism surrounding the UK's Labor Party and its leader Jeremy Corbyn will debate whether the British left has a problem with anti-jewish hatred and how much these accusations have to do with criticism of Israel but first since April of this year Nicaragua's faced a political crisis with both supporters and opponents of President Daniel Ortega clashing in the streets hundreds have been killed and thousands wounded many of them at the hands of pro-government militias according to human rights groups as many are calling for Ortega to resign he insists it's all part of an attempted coup but does his government take any responsibility for the violence and the chaos I lost this week's headliner Nicaragua's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Val Dragonscale Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of Val Drac yam Scafe thanks for joining me on upfront Nicaragua this year has been in crisis since April you have hundreds of people reported killed thousands wounded armed groups attacking civilians on the streets thousands of Nicaraguans fleeing to neighboring Costa Rican do you does your government the government of Daniel Ortega take any responsibility for any of that the government of Nicaragua faced a violent criminal coup the reason we call it a coup is because it's fundamental and main objective was to overthrow the constitutional elected government Nicaragua an election that happened just recently in 2016 and that was recognized by many international organizations including the OAS as expressing the will of the people that violent uprising that violent coup was perpetrated by a group of political motivated fringes of political parties NGOs who then mobilized through manipulation terror and fear the population of Nicaragua so a lot of governments a lot of human rights activists a lot of journalists have objected to your description of it as a coup they say you haven't brought forward evidence you say it is a coup isn't the easiest way to solve this to allow un observers who you invited into the country earlier this year to finish their job rather than kicking them out as your government did in others now when they asked for greater access to prisons and to other areas we probably now kick out the UN Human Rights Commission we invited UN monitors to accompany the government and the dialogue especially the the Council of Bishops in organizing what we call the verification Commission that was supposed to go on the streets and try to verify what was happening that is what we invited them to do that reason was not any longer needed because you're telling the world there was a coup you're saying that all the protesters the ones doing the killing the UN are saying hold on we've got evidence otherwise and you say goodbye we're revoking the invitation to the US 198 now 200 that are the result of a coup all nations monus's it is result of the coup everything it's somebody else's in the United Nations you a pretty credible group of people it's not the CIA coming to check on the rest but I'm saying you we're not saying that we've seen human rights abuses we want to go into prisons we're not led into prisons we're getting reports of killing of civilians just release the number of prisoners and the conditions with the prisoners are doing what we are saying is that we did 19 who did not invite no so there's a coup against us we are clean you've provided no evidence and you chucked out the UL we're clear makes you look suspicious the evidence is very simple the mobilization on the street was to overthrow violently the government if that is not a reason and if that is not the definition of a cool then what did his definition of a cool the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has said you're sliding into a dangerous spiral of violence and impunity amnesty says Nicaragua is turning into a pressure cooker about to explode because of serious human rights violations permitted by your government the inter-american Commission on Human Rights says you should seriously investigate the killings Human Rights Watch says the same are all these groups in making it up they all want to affected the inter-american Human Rights Commission to help us understand what happened at the beginning and they instead because of their methodology using information coming from NGO or local organizations without any verification began to define the these activities we say that what happened on the streets was perpetrated by a group of very radical and very violent a military activists you have the names I can show you the photos so you've arrived you will have a resident and we are in the process of arresting them and that we don't have political prisoners the arisen wagons see very well the tab there isn't they disagree with you expressed one single political prisoner hundred people we are cell we have since April we have captured and that is what the human rights organs in the Internet inter-american Human Rights Commission asked us to do they asked they told me do not look at these we cannot look at non state violence you are the Vice foreign minister of the cluster you are travelling the world speaking on behalf of your government I'm asking very simple question when the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch and the inter-american Commission on Human Rights are all saying that you are killing civilians that you are holding political prisoners why are they saying that are they because they are feeding from a number of organizations do you understand the concept of homogeny homogenization of the discourse this is what we're saying the information that is coming out of Nicaragua is manipulated and it is based on false premises the problem that when I look at it as an outsider the human rights groups are admitting what you're saying they're saying policemen have been killed by police men okay my point is they're criticizing protests more than 60% of us killed our government let me let me just ask is the human rights groups are criticizing both sides you're saying you've killed no one who's the new is saying that the police has responded to armed attacks that's what we're saying is so amazed when pro-government militias kill 16 protesters in what was basically a massacre Nicaragua's mother's day we don't have minister who is a peaceful in the mosque geez people animals are police and police voluntary police we halogen or whatever level is the law of 1992 of 1990 police law of 1992 the poly flower 1996 and the police lair of 2002 or 2006 recognizes that the police uses voluntary police which is a group is a set of citizens who support the police let me ask you about the the examples that are given by some of the reports a woman told the United Nations that a group of hooded men detained my husband at our house beat him took him away naked is she lying the pregnant woman who told Associated Press that she was hit in the face slapped by a group of police and volley police they crushed my fingers hit me in the ribs and stomach when I was on the ground they kicked me is she lying to all these protesters lying the Nicaraguan police has been recognized publicly and in the world as a human right police that respects human rights false that is not false I read to you quality from amnesty police police has been recognized and the basic concept is you find some elements just cause a statement human rights just do under any guys the Nicaraguan police this year as respect to human rights that is a flat the current policeman does not violate Human Rights favorite human rights lose respect what I'm saying is there are there are there's human rights organizations are feeding off of that's why I say question the women they said let me ask my question you know the women you say a pregnant woman fellow in the current UN citizen who you represent your you're the government elected government when she says the volunteer police beat me kicked me in the stomach that doesn't worry it as a body it already must have you know it worries me and we are carrying out every single investigation that's necessary to understand what happened that is the origin of the invitation of the inter-american Human Rights Commission if people we brought you to then your volunteer police or militias as well we are carrying out the investigation we are right now in the process of carrying to the courts every single one of those who are in the roadblocks you must remember that the people you are prosecuting you're saying you're prosecuting people are both sides of the damage what are you saying we are beginning to prosecute people who have committed crimes and that is the process that is ongoing the police was half of the streets of Nicaragua for 51 days by request of the bishops and the most heinous crimes were committed in those 51 days between the end of April and live June since July 5th police were of the series but the volunteer police were not Daniel Ortega who is now 70 has spent more time in power 21 years over two stints than the late brutal dictator he helped overthrow in 1979 Somoza Presidente hasn't just abolished term limits he's also seems to have brought back family rule to Nicaragua the vice president is his wife and his children have been appointed to key advisory positions in government is it any wonder then that his critics are saying he's the new Somoza the new dynastic leader that is that is bringing by the whole idea polarization number one and number two I don't see anyone at the Children's on the government payroll that is I don't see that we're not gonna get the discussion because now let's go back to other examples but come here the vice president of the country for many reasons constitutional reasons she has a right to run for political reason she has been a cadre in the Sandinista movement historically and we have a law in what we call it 50/50 law that you have to have a candidate for president the vice president has to be if it's one is a man the other one has to be only but what you're telling me is that because gender balance is the reason she's the vice president it's gonna find any other women in the crowd but what I'm saying is you have a cadre that has been historically a part of this Anniston movement yes there may be other people of course there let's talk about the sentiment too let's talk about the sandanista movement the president's own brother Umberto Ortega who's in charge of the armed forces for many years he says quote this is not a dictatorship but it's very authoritarian family dominated style of governing is he part of a coup a conspiracy against his brother I'm saying is he has his own position his own position and he has a right to his own position I'm not saying as he part of the conspiracy I'm saying I don't see his partner in comparison wait Aaron got his opinion of the government of his own brother so when I look at so many high-profile figures who were supporters of yours in the 1980s supported the Sandinistas struggle who are now shocked to what your government are doing the philosopher Noam Chomsky says there's been a lot of corruption a lot of repression your government is autocratic the celebrity activist Bianca Jagger says Daniel Ortega may be worse than Somoza he's a war criminal Gioconda belli the Nicaraguan poet former sandanista activist joined your movement in 1970 she says Ortega and his wife have turned the Kreger into a land of terror why are all these people who spent their lives supporting your shift they shifted when we see who is the best planner of how this whole media manipulation system happens can have his opinion but you're talking to me about homogeneous opinions okay let me ask you this you have a situation now where as you say you what you call a coup others have calling you no protests legitimate protests what is the solution to this crisis Ted what are you gonna do about these people who are taking the streets just carry on shooting at them no we're not carrying on shooting of them since July 15 when we recaptured the streets when we move the way then we remove the barricades there hasn't been one single person died one last question as you deepen democracy will you be supporting President Ortega if he runs again in 2021 that's a decision of the Congress of the party but you're in favor and he personally if President Ortega runs I would be supporting the president for life I am NOT saying president for life I am saying the Sandinista is an evolving movement a very strong nationalist movement who is there to strengthen democracy and to strengthen the development of the country that is what was being destroyed in this perpetrated cool Vice foreign minister thanks for joining me on upfront thank you very much the UK Labour Party has been hit by accusations of anti-semitism in recent months especially against its leader Jeremy Corbyn his fellow Labour MP Margaret Hodge who lost members of her family in the Holocaust said Corbin was an anti-semitic racist while three of the main Jewish newspapers in the UK described him as an existential threat to British Jews the Labour leader has been accused of sharing platforms with Holocaust deniers and making offensive remarks about British Zionists his supporters though argue that Colburn is a lifelong anti-racist and that the attacks against him are smears designed to discredit his strong support for Palestinians and prevent criticism of Israel so is the Labour leader really guilty of anti-semitism or even of turning a blind eye to it joining me from London to debate this are Michael Rosen and award-winning novelist and poet and a Jewish Corbin supporter and Daniella Peled a writer and contributor to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz a former foreign editor of the Jewish Chronicle and a Jewish Corbin critic thank you both for joining me in the arena at Danijela speaking on Wednesday at his party's annual conference in Liverpool Jeremy Corbyn said we will work with Jewish communities to eradicate anti-semitism both from our party and wider society he says there's a problem he says he's dealing with it that doesn't sound like an anti-semite does it mr. Corbyn has not won the confidence to support the vast majority of British Jews and although you can find his supporters of cherry-pick Jew Jewish people who are speaking out in support of him I've never seen such a consensus amongst this very very diverse community feeling that Labour is no longer a comfortable place for them and for our global audience who haven't been following the details of this how would you sum up in kind of if you can sum it up why the British Jewish community has this consensus that Labour is no longer a comfortable place for them well mr. Corbyn is part of traditionally far left of Labor who have quite a binary view of the world divided up into nice anti-imperialists like Iran Russia Syria and the nasty Western imperialists like America Israel NATO the EU as well and in this very binary reading of Foreign Affairs Jews end up as white imperialist and I think this worldview has now become quite dominant in the party and that makes Jewish feed people people who are not really that bothered about Israel one way or another feel that they are being sidelined and being discriminated against and most importantly that when they say this is anti-semitism and they call out instances yeah of prejudice they're told that this is somehow a smear Michael Rosen it's not all a smear is it well I think first we can have to back back a bit and sort out some definitions here we talk about the Jewish community as if there is just one community it's not really strictly speaking true and there are plenty of Jews in the labour party I'm not in the labour party but I support Jeremy Corbyn Michael just to be clear do you at least recognize we can argue about the numbers but a big chunk of the British Jewish community is unhappy with labor under Corbin because they perceive it as not a safe space or a comfortable space or a friendly space for British Jews you concede that is the perception even if you disagree with the reasoning behind it yes of course it you know absolutely but then of course exactly as Daniella says a large percentage of the Jewish community if that's what we're going to call it large percentage of Jews are in favor of Israel but not all Jews amount and I have no attachment to that place over there but of course I understand that plenty of Jews do plenty of Jews are brought up to believe that Israel is their homeland even if they don't make it their homeland it is there for them as they believe of course but there are the people living there this is the crucial point about Israel there are other people not recognized by the recent nation-state law Danijela how much of this is to do with the israel-palestine conflict with this thorny debate over Zionism anti-zionism when you do have the Chief Rabbi and the former Chief Rabbi of the UK both saying that anti-zionism is a form of anti-semitism it does muddy the water when we're trying to work out what is bigotry what is hatred what is legitimate political criticism doesn't well I think the real problem here is this accusation that critics of Corbin Jewish critics of Corbin are criticizing him as part of a smear campaign because their real interests are in defending Israel apparently or they're all conservative voters who are weaponizing anti-semitism as this political tool and that feeds straight into always classic anti-semitic tropes that I've been exposed to as well mostly as a reporter writing about Israel Palestine that Jews are more loyal to each other and by extension Israel than the countries that they live in and the countries that they're citizens of now this doesn't jeremy corbyn's comments about Zionists not understanding irony a classic example of this kind of attitude that I've experienced over and over again and I think that is the most wounding and the most damaging part of this whole thing Michael I sort of drill down into labor and Jeremy Corbyn I want to get your sense of where you stand it is your position that Jeremy Corbyn that he's done nothing wrong and that this is a smear campaign from the right or from supporters of Israel or is it your position that perhaps he's used bad language in the past or he's said the wrong thing or does he have a blind spot for this stuff maybe that's what some have suggested supporters of is where do you stand I think the basic mistake if he has made mistakes is he hasn't been vocal enough in defying and picking back if you like because he's not a linguist he's not he's a politician and he thinks that he has an honorable thing to do which is to support the rights of justice and peace in the Middle East and justice for the Palestinians and he thinks that has nothing to do directly with discrimination against Jews discrimination against Jews or indeed prejudice against Jews in Britain that's what he thinks done by and large I agree with Daniella it would be interesting to know from you then what would be my motivations as a lifelong labor voter for saying there is a real problem with anti-semitism in labour and my part of the smear am i in there a part of a conservative smear or being funded by the Israeli embassy there are plenty of people who stand up for Palestinian rights and say there is a problem you're tying yourself in knots to try and justify what's not justifiable when Boris John made his really rather unpleasant comments about Muslim women looking letterboxes people dealt with those comments as they were on their merits or rather their lack of merits no one was saying this is part of a left-wing conspiracy trying to derail a potential government led by Boris Johnson let's look at what he has said and judged on its merits and those merits are very lacking well as it happens Daniella I haven't said it's a right-wing conspiracy or anybody's conspiracy sitting here if some people do well you know they've worked out that maybe there are some relationships between Jews in Britain and Israel and Israelis I'm not saying that though I what I would say is that the media in this country was very reluctant no smear there's no allegations of smear most vocal hang-on were most vocal about it had had very important positions and recognized positions in the Conservative Party all right and so had those links and indeed the ex Chief Rabbi was a great great very fond of Margaret Thatcher so it's not as if the only agenda these people had in attacking Corey well all I'm saying is that just to not investigate other reasons why people might want to attack a labor leader is quite important you remember the last Labour leader we had was attacked for having a father who was a Jewish traitor by a Tory newspaper The Daily Mail Ed Miliband who was the first Jewish leader of the Labour Party didn't win a majority of Jews support in 2015 and a lot of their anti-semitism cases at a local level on it did did turn up on his leadership you know on his watch so his some would say it is unfair to put this all at Corbin's door the bad relationship between the Labour Party and British Jewish communities would you concede that I think as I said I think it's part of symptomatic of a wider issue the fact that his leadership has emboldened a section of the far left that has always held these really rather extreme views towards British Jews as being wealthy as being part of the ruling class has been capitalist and being imperialists and Corbett has not taken significant action he hasn't spoken out and he hasn't apologized or made consul patience in any kind he has apologized to believe me he has apologized several times there has an effort for making mistakes for not dealing with this soon enough and he's now come out this week in the conference and said we want to eradicate any semitism we won't tolerate this in the party he is repeatedly in the House of Commons supported Jews over twenty years he's partly supported early day motions as we call them in the House of Commons here supported Jews counted ten times over the last 25 years so you know he's no the Viktor Orban I will say to you that of course there is a problem as there is in the whole society I'm repeating if you like exactly what John Landsman the leader of one of the supporting groups but there are plenty of Jews in the labour party I came from a left-wing Jewish tradition that thought that one of the ways we could deal with our problems of universal values one of the ways wish to join labor and socialist parties Michael just on the issue of the problem Daniel Daniella is saying that you're you know you're denying the problem you're saying there's a problem in labor as therein as there is with the rest of society kolben himself said in a statement recently anyone who denies that this is surfaced in our party is clearly actually wrong and contributing to the problem it's not enough to just say well everyone's at got anti-semitism problem and therefore do a bit of what about ISM is it I agree because obviously the Labour Party is founded on universalistic ideas of human rights it claims to be an anti-racist party so of course the Jeremy caldron will say well we we do have a problem if we have any anti-semites in the labour party there may be anti-semites out there in society but it's our job to root it out of the labour party indeed so let me ask you this daniela before we finish what is the solution moving forward for this fort to relationship between British Jews and the Labour Party under Corbin is there a solution or is it too late I'm afraid I can't see one right now I think that there's been a lack of effort to show goodwill a lack of communication and I think this extends to a wide range of issues I have personally more problems with the Labour Party's view on Syria or on Ukraine or other Foreign Affairs issues than I do on israel-palestine but I think the gap is just too large and Trust has been eroded no it's a long time to come Michael Trust has been eroded how does Jeremy Corbyn get it back or can he not get it back I don't know I'm no great crystal ball gazing interesting thing here is the question to ask is are those people who are opposed to Jeremy Corbyn over this matter are they interested in eradicating anti-semitism or are they interested in eradicating Jeremy Corbyn that's what the plotting all this summer and before has been about let's get rid of Corbin Michael Rosen Daniel Apple ed we'll have to leave it there thank you very much for joining me in the arena that's our show upfront we back next week you
