1
00:00:00,095 --> 00:00:01,797
STAFF MORE DIRECTLY SO THEY'LL

2
00:00:01,797 --> 00:00:03,699
TRY TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO

3
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:05,501
ABOUT THE BLUE WAVE BETWEEN NOW

4
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:06,602
AND NOVEMBER, DANA.

5
00:00:06,602 --> 00:00:07,736
>> Dana: THANKS, PETER.

6
00:00:07,736 --> 00:00:09,338
LET'S BRING IN THE CHAIRMAN OF

7
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:11,673
THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN

8
00:00:11,673 --> 00:00:14,443
CONGRESSIONAL ECONOMY, STEVE

9
00:00:14,443 --> 00:00:14,776
STIVERS.

10
00:00:14,776 --> 00:00:15,777
YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF THE

11
00:00:15,777 --> 00:00:16,678
REPUBLICANS TRYING TO KEEP THE

12
00:00:16,678 --> 00:00:17,446
HOUSE THIS FALL.

13
00:00:17,446 --> 00:00:18,947
YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.

14
00:00:18,947 --> 00:00:21,984
LET ME READ YOU A TWEET FROM AN

15
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:24,353
ELECTIONS GUY, G. ELLIOT MORRIS.

16
00:00:24,353 --> 00:00:26,121
THEY SAID THEY MADE GAINS --

17
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:27,689
THEY MADE GAINS BETWEEN 6 AND

18
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:28,624
20% LAST NIGHT.

19
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:30,392
HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS

20
00:00:30,392 --> 00:00:32,761
COMPETED TO VOTE TOTALS IN 2016.

21
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:34,496
HE SAYS PROJECTING TO NOVEMBER,

22
00:00:34,496 --> 00:00:35,898
DEMOCRATS ARE AHEAD IN THREE OF

23
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:39,034
THE DISTRICTS, 49-25 AND 10.

24
00:00:39,034 --> 00:00:40,502
I ONLY BRING THAT UP BECAUSE I

25
00:00:40,502 --> 00:00:42,171
THINK THAT EVERYONE HAS AGREED

26
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:43,939
NOW THAT AT THIS POINT A WAVE

27
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:45,040
DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT'S

28
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,407
POSSIBLE.

29
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:47,543
SO THE DEMOCRATS ARE HAVING TO

30
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:49,378
LOOK VERY SPECIFICALLY AT

31
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:50,579
CERTAIN RACES THAT THEY THINK

32
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,481
THEY CAN TARGET.

33
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:53,048
YOUR THOUGHTS.

34
00:00:53,048 --> 00:00:54,783
>> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT, DANA.

35
00:00:54,783 --> 00:00:55,884
GREAT TO BE ON.

36
00:00:55,884 --> 00:00:58,220
YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY DOESN'T LOOK

37
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,354
LIKE A BLUE WAVE.

38
00:00:59,354 --> 00:01:02,124
MIGHT BE A BLUE DRIBBLE.

39
00:01:02,124 --> 00:01:02,925
RIGHT NOW LAST NIGHT THREE

40
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:03,525
THINGS HAPPENED.

41
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:05,561
ONE IS WE GOT A REPUBLICAN

42
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:06,762
CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR AND THAT

43
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:08,630
WILL HELP TURN OUT AMONG

44
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,131
REPUBLICANS.

45
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:11,400
TWO, AS WE TESTED OUR TURN OUT

46
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,267
MESSAGES AND THEY WORKED.

47
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:14,536
WE HAD MORE REPUBLICAN TURNOUT

48
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:17,439
IN EVERY CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

49
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,073
EXCEPT ONE.

50
00:01:18,073 --> 00:01:19,975
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT.

51
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:21,476
FINALLY, THE GAS TAX THAT IS ON

52
00:01:21,476 --> 00:01:24,079
THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER PROVED TO

53
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,615
BE A VERY POTENT SUBJECT IN A

54
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:28,750
RECALL VOTE IN ORANGE COUNTY AND

55
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,620
L.A. COUNTY YESTERDAY AGAINST

00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,924
THE STATE SENATE

THE STATE SENATOR

58
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:36,024
THE STATE SENATOR,

59
00:01:36,024 --> 00:01:36,058
THE STATE SENATOR, T

60
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:36,091
THE STATE SENATOR, THA

61
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:36,525
THE STATE SENATOR, THAT

62
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:36,558
THE STATE SENATOR, THAT L

63
00:01:36,558 --> 00:01:36,592
THE STATE SENATOR, THAT LOS

64
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:36,725
THE STATE SENATOR, THAT LOST

65
00:01:36,725 --> 00:01:36,758
THE STATE SENATOR, THAT LOST H

66
00:01:36,758 --> 00:01:37,059
THE STATE SENATOR, THAT LOST HIS

67
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:37,693
RECALL VOTE.

68
00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:38,327
>> YEAH.

69
00:01:38,327 --> 00:01:41,530
GAS IS UP TO $5 A GALLON.

70
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,397
>> $5.

71
00:01:42,397 --> 00:01:43,365
>> Dana: THAT WILL MOTIVATE YOU

72
00:01:43,365 --> 00:01:45,834
TO GET TO THE POLLS.

73
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:47,736
THE DCCC SAYS THE BLUE

74
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:48,570
CANDIDATES WENT THROUGH.

75
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,105
SO THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN

76
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:51,840
STRATEGIC AND SMART ON THE WAY

77
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,641
TO THIS.

78
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:53,875
IS CALIFORNIA SOMETHING THAT,

79
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,177
YOU KNOW, ARE YOU GOING TO

80
00:01:55,177 --> 00:01:56,578
CONTINUE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT OR

81
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:58,413
MOVE ON AND LOOK TO OTHER PLACES

82
00:01:58,413 --> 00:01:59,915
LIKE COLORADO, NEW YORK AND I

83
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:03,652
ALSO WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT

84
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:07,823
MARTHA ROBEY, FORCED INTO A

85
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:08,457
RUN-OFF YESTERDAY.

86
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:09,925
>> YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE

87
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:12,461
TO FOCUS ON CALIFORNIA.

88
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:14,129
WE HAVE AN ENDURING PRESENCE

89
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:14,429
THERE.

90
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:16,365
WE HAVE AN OFFICE IN IRVINE.

91
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:17,766
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT OUR CHANCES TO

92
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:19,968
HOLD THOSE SEATS AND I'LL

93
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:20,836
ANNOUNCE SOMETHING TODAY.

94
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:23,839
CONGRESSMAN PETE AGUILLAR, A

95
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:26,541
DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT GOT LESS

96
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,377
VOTES THAN SEAN FLYNN IN HIS

97
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:28,877
RACE YESTERDAY.

98
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:31,280
SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A MAJOR

99
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,614
TARGET FOR US NOW.

100
00:02:32,614 --> 00:02:34,683
IT'S NEW ON OUR LIST.

101
00:02:34,683 --> 00:02:37,119
PETE AGUILLAR, YOU KNOW, SHOWED

102
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,587
HIS WEAKNESS IN FINISHING SECOND

103
00:02:38,587 --> 00:02:40,689
AS A SITTING INCUMBENT.

104
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:41,456
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO

105
00:02:41,456 --> 00:02:43,058
CONTINUE TO MOVE TO WHERE THE

106
00:02:43,058 --> 00:02:45,060
NEW PRIMARIES ARE AND WHERE THE

107
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,296
GENERAL ELECTIONS ARE MOVING

108
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:48,196
FORWARD THERE ARE SOME

109
00:02:48,196 --> 00:02:49,398
COMPETITIVE RACES IN CALIFORNIA

110
00:02:49,398 --> 00:02:51,433
THAT WE'RE GOING TO STAY FOCUSED

111
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:53,335
ON AND MAKE SURE OUR CANDIDATES

112
00:02:53,335 --> 00:02:53,702
WIN.

113
00:02:53,702 --> 00:02:56,138
OBVIOUSLY MARTHA ROBEY FINISHED

114
00:02:56,138 --> 00:02:56,872
STRONG LAST NIGHT.

115
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:58,640
SHE GOT ABOVE 40%.

116
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,509
SHE DIDN'T GET TO 50.

117
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:03,779
SO NOW SHE HAS THE RUN-OFF

118
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:05,480
AGAINST THE FORMER DEMOCRATIC

119
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,715
CONGRESSMAN WHO CLAIMS HE'S A

120
00:03:06,715 --> 00:03:07,115
REPUBLICAN.

121
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:09,217
IN THE RUN OFF, HE WILL HAVE A

122
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:11,653
HARD TIME EXPLAINING HIS VOTE

123
00:03:11,653 --> 00:03:12,821
FOR NANCY PELOSI IN 2009.

124
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:13,822
>> Dana: IN THE LAST MINUTE I

125
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:15,490
HAVE FOR YOU.

126
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,858
THE DEMOCRATS ARE TOUTING AND

127
00:03:16,858 --> 00:03:20,228
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO.

128
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:22,531
345 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ARE

129
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:23,198
WOMEN RUNNING.

130
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:24,633
BUT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE FOCUSED

131
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:26,301
ON THIS AND YOU HAVE A GOOD

132
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:28,670
STORY TO TELL.

00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:32,641

PARTY IN SEATS WE CAN WIN.

138
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:38,613
LAST NIGHT WE HAD YOUNG KIM WIN

139
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:40,115
