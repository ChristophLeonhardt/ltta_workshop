so yeah we all got it wrong everybody who wrote Donald Trump off as a political charlatan destined to flame out and everybody who called Trump a clown who had probably returned to his reality show and leave us all alone and everybody who suggested that this circus couldn't just couldn't continue yeah we were all wrong maybe we were guilty of believing that Trump's mistakes would break out into the mainstream rather than dying slow deaths on cable TV maybe we thought that voters would wake up to Trump's bombastic narcissism and just sort of turn away or maybe as statistician Nate Silver put it we were guilty of not predicting that the Republican Party would lose it to f'ing mind whatever the rationale from definitely a shock to everybody but the political commentator and Coulter and a few other Trump stalwarts so here are five lessons to take away from Trump winning the nomination first failure to utilize ideological purity tests actually leads to the rise of leftist candidates in your own party so the bizarre paradox of people who think like Trump is that the same people complaining about Republicans caving to Obama now want to nominate a lifelong Democrat ad-hoc politician with no centralizing principle other than his own glorification a guy who brags openly he'll cut more deals with Democrats and when conservatives object Trump supporters point to GOP nominations of Mitt Romney who created Obamacare and John McCain who created campaign finance reform and amnesty and they're being hypocritical these people say McCain and Romney were by any measure more conservative overall than from but the feeling that conservatism doesn't matter any longer it's hard to quell when two so many major Republicans it really didn't matter that much in 2008 and 2012 second lesson if you ignore social issues that means that the only way to now appeal to disgruntled blue-collar voters is if you move left on economics we talked about this a couple of days ago there's been a lot of loose talk about Donald Trump's appeal with disenchanted white voters who didn't show up for Mitt Romney from does indeed appeal to them with lies about how he's gonna create tariffs that bring back jobs and taxing the rich this is straight from the Bernie Sanders playbook now these people did used to vote Republican before the Republican Party decided to toss Social Policy same-sex marriage abortion out the window to pander to New Yorkers like Donald Trump third lesson the moral narrative way-hey more important than power knowledge Trump knows way less way less about policy than my four day old child and he cares less about the Constitution than my boy does but that doesn't matter because he's fighting the establishment by which from means everyone who disagrees with him and because he's conflating the establishment with a political establishment that insists on cutting deals with Obama Republican voters by in fourth lesson when there are no good guys in politics character just stops mattering there's an Indiana voter last week she was asked about the fact that Trump always lies she said yeah well you know all the politicians lie at least Trump lies differently than other politicians that's kind of weird but it's true if all the politicians are automatic Liars then Trump's lack of character and credibility that sort of fades into the woodwork and all that's left is him saying outrageous things that need to be said final lesson lack of institutional trust leads to a rise in fascism not to Liberty okay we hate the media but instead of seeking honest members of the media we revel in people who lie to the media and get away with it like Trump we hate the political establishment instead of looking for people who will abide by constitutional limitations and minimize the role of government we look for a strong man a bad strong man to break apart the system Trump's rise reflects and foreshadows a really ugly future for the country I hope I'm wrong on that prediction I certainly was about Trump's rise i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show all righty here we are and you should subscribe go to daily wire right now you can subscribe this allows you

Shapiro mailbag is tomorrow so it's not too late to get in on that okay lot to talk about today including malthus's new podcast which we'll get to later but we will also be talking about Donald Trump and his various promises to various interest groups Oh Donald Trump is playing this double game right now he's playing one game for the Conservatives in one game for everybody else so to the Conservatives he's sort of making his usual overtures and what this does is we don't believe him we think he's lying and we think that he's full of it but by him saying this it gives cover to people like Rick Perry and people like Bobby Jindal who say oh he'll definitely better be better than Hillary so for example yesterday Trump said that he would appoint pro-life judges here's what it looked like I will protect it and the biggest way you can protect it is through the Supreme Court and putting people on the court I'm actually the biggest way you can protect protected I guess is by electing me president right so you're going to get a judge who would overthrow overturn roe v wade that's what you that's the specific overturning or overturn look I'm going to put conservative judges on I think one of the biggest things happening in terms of this election are you know it could be as many as five judges will be appointed over the next four and a half years so we're talking about five judges and I think probably the most important thing that one of the most important thing other than the security itself of the country is going to be the appointment of four types let me just get this race I'll be doing that Diane's question is answered your specific thing to protect the sanctity of life would be appointing a Supreme Court justice that would overturn roe v wade do I have it well they'll be pro-life and we'll see what about overturning but they will be we will appoint I will appoint judges that will be pro-life okay he's absolutely meaningless the man's a absolutely meaningless because it O'Reilly asks him the specific question right the only thing that matters if you if you're a pro-life person the number one obstacle to the pro-life position in America is roe v wade so O'Reilly asks him you say that you'll appoint pro-life justices first of all I love that Trump doesn't know the difference between judges and justices okay you're appointing five justices to the Supreme Court at the Supreme Court level that call justices at the lower court level they're called judges in any case he says that he's going to appoint all these judges these justices and then he says I'll appoint pro-life judges justices I don't know what they'll do about roe v wade then they're not pro-life they're also not Pro Constitution because it's a really really bad constitutional decision by any order but what's what this does is it allows people like O'Reilly and Sean Hannity and the last people like Laura Ingraham and Ann Coulter to say what are you pro-life people whining about he said he was pro-life he said he's going to appoint pro-life judges well I don't believe him and the reason I don't believe him is because he reversed himself every five minutes on policy and you can tell what he cares about and the only thing that Donald Trump cares about is his own personal aggrandizement his own personal power so I'm supposed to believe him now that he's going to appoint a pro-life justice to overturn roe v wade when he won't even say that the justice that he appoints will have a litmus test of overturning roe v wade I mean look at a specific language you can always tell where people stand when you walk them down to the specifics it's easy to say things in broad terms it's very hard to get down to specifics the left loves talking in broad terms about gun control when you try to narrow them down to specifics okay what do you suggest that we do and what does that look like then they run from the fight immediately they don't want any part of it because the fact is they don't know what they're talking about and it's the same thing with Trump on pro-life I'm supposed to trust him anyway even if he had said I'm going to appoint justices who will reverse roe v wade would I believe him well given the fact that he flip-flops on all of his positions simultaneously and it's kaleidoscopic nonsense probably not I mean here's Donald Trump for example on taxes just today I was a little upset because my taxes are gonna go up if you win I'm gonna be paying more than I thought it was repaying less no no no it was incorrectly if you read The Wall Street Journal front page today they covered it exactly correct I am going I have the biggest tax cut of anybody running by far and that includes the 16 people that are vanquished okay and nobody even came close but I may have to raise it from that point it was enjoy your original statement in the debate you might have to go up a little for me for me I might have no know what it meant no no no you'll get actually perhaps go down actually everybody's going to go down but who's really going to go down is the middle class who have been absolutely destroyed by that as you said you wouldn't anymore you yourself wouldn't mind paying well would not mind paying that's kind of an indication of guys in your back down no no no the question was asked what I might pay more I wouldn't mind but the fact is that everybody's going to be paying less and we're going to run a much better a much better but we're going to run a color hey Bill we're going to run a country that works we're going to get this country going again because right now this country is stalled so badly and taxes are going to go down and that's one of the ways we're gonna get it to work man it's just it's so incoherent and it's so back and forth he did say he would raise taxes on the wealthiest then he said what I mean is I'm gonna lower taxes on the wealthiest but then they might have to rise again sort of like his immigration plan I'm gonna deport everybody but then they can all come back in right this is what he has said right touchback amnesty they leave they come back and now there's here than their citizens again and this is all nonsense so when he makes promises I wrote a piece for National Review today I'm now contributor over there I wrote a piece for National Review today and one of the things that I said is he has to if Trump actually wanted to woo conservatives and I'll explain why he doesn't in just a moment if he actually wanted to woo us what he would actually be doing is he would actually be attempting to prove to us that his promises can be kept that he's actually going to be consistent he has to show like a little bit of consistency because otherwise he can make all the conservative promises he wants I'm not going to believe him you know I don't believe people who routinely cheat me in business then next time they won't cheat me they have to give me a long record of now they've gotten past all the cheating in order for me to start trusting them with my money I'm not gonna trust Donald Trump on his positions when the man legitimately flip-flops every position he has ever held in a matter of moments depending on who's asking him the questions so that there's Trump now I say again he's doing a lot of this as cover so he's saying something to everyone that they presumably like so that when they're asked about it why do you support Trump they can give their version of the positions that they like so when Rick Perry is asked what about Trump do you like Rick Perry the same guy who called Donald Trump a quote cancer on conservatism who's now backing Donald Trump when people ask him okay so why do you support Donald Trump you can say well he says he's gonna lower taxes for the rich well he says he's gonna appoint pro-life judges and then you find somebody who's pro-choice and the person who's pro-choice will say well you know he's not really a pro-life I mean he said that he's not gonna touch roe v wade basically he says he backs Planned Parenthood the person who wants higher taxes say oh well you know he says that sort of for public consumption when you signal to people that you're lying all the time then you are going to draw actually a larger group of people to you because the bottom line is there's always something somebody can find a reason to back you and so you know this is sort of Trump's campaign on in a political nutshell now there's another element to Trump's campaign that is very telling and this is why I think that Trump is a relatively scary character and that is that Trump has never apologized for anything ever apologized for anything now I remember a few months back there was a host on NPR and I'm very remember her name but there's a host under Diane Rehm I think and and she she said she's a host on NPR and she has a very it's hard to listen to her voice it's very hard to listen to her voice and I was on my morning show out here in LA and I mocked her voice on air and I found out during a break that she actually had a throat condition she had something that's wrong with her throat and that's why her voice sounds back so I we came back from the break and I said you know I really want to apologize for that I didn't know she had a throat condition obviously that changes the nature of the mockery and that's not any fault of her own not only that she actually has a disability that's that's really sad and I'm sorry I did that that was not nice that was those bad that's what normal decent people do when you hurt people you apologize to people when you're wrong you apologize to people Donald Trump never apologizes for anything because Donald Trump is the candidate of might makes right Donald Trump is the candidate of if I am more popular after saying something that I was before saying that thing then it must have been that I was right popularity means that I was right me being popular means it's justification for what I do if people liked that I did something that means that it's an okay thing that I did and if people don't like it then it must be because they misconstrued what I said like on the tax proposal there so you're about to see Donald Trump is his new routine it really isn't new but it's now coming to the forefront because he's won the nomination Katrina Pierson who is his his really kind of nasty spokesperson she she's on with Fox and she's asked by martha maccallum about why he doesn't just apologize to women for saying nasty things about women and here's what she says and he closed that gap I understand but you know what he needs to do is grow his base he needs to bring people into the tent who are not in the tent right now right so wouldn't it been doing that remember he didn't know but wouldn't it be see you say he only said those things when he was an entertainer and there you know you could beg to differ with that that some of those comments have continued on into the present but if that's the case why doesn't he come out and talk about that why doesn't he say you know what I said things that might have been off-color that I wouldn't really want my children or my grandchildren to say I was trying to be funny with Howard Stern and he has said that to a certain extent but but perhaps apologize say if I've offended any of you I apologize and I don't mean you know to be mean-spirited against women why not do that well because that's the politically correct thing to do a rally Katrina doing in missing the realm of polite thing to say and it's what I would imagine you would expect on save his children or anyone else tell you this Martha at the same time this is a response if he has said anything like that it since the entertainment world is in response to criticism of him he doesn't just wake up in the morning and wanting to offend people he's responding to people who are offending him his supporters even his staff for that matter this is a response mr. Trump has always said it is a counter punch and just because you criticize a woman after she criticizes you that doesn't make you a sexist or a misogynist I get what you're saying I mean your argument is that he's an equal opportunity offender that you know he Carly Fiorina made him mad he said what he said about her he also called you know Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz lots of names as well and in some ways I can understand that that's interpreted as basically you know equality right he's treating everybody exactly the same but but the fact remains that he does not do well with women in many of these polls so when you look at the national polls right so politically wouldn't it be smart for him to maybe you know speak a little bit differently on these issues well he has said on the stump and in some interviews I'm that some of those comments were pulled out of context for the entertainment realm but I also think that taking his message out to the public and showing that many of these women have no idea who mr. Trump really is when it when it comes to women because they don't get to hear about all the women that mr. Trump brought in his organization they don't know that the majority of his examination should talk about that we can stop it here so bottom line is you see even how Fox is covering this though the way that they're showing pictures of Melania while we're talking about women Donald Trump was means it right no pictures of megyn kelly no pictures excuse me Michelle fields or no pictures of Carly Fiorina no pictures of Heidi Cruz what Heidi Cruz do to him that they caused him to come out against Heidi Cruz right well what exactly caused that but Donald Trump his people say bottom line he's not going to apologize because it's not hurting him and because he's a winner he's a big winner so he's never going to apologize for anything that he says now as you remember you remember way back in August Donald Trump said this about John McCain right so I'd never liked them as much after that because I don't like lasers but but Frank Frank let me get to it he hit me he's not a war hero he's a war he's a war hero because he was captured I like people that weren't captured okay I hate to tell you Julie stop it there he likes war heroes who were captured who were not captured you know he doesn't like war heroes we're captured he's not a war hero right so he was asked about this yesterday and here was Donald Trump's response because McCain said why don't you just apologize to veterans why don't just say I shouldn't have said that you know that wasn't a nasty thing to say you know it's my fault why won't you just apologize for that here's Donald Trump listen to his response again this is the might makes right campaign here's Trump he have said that he he doesn't want an apology from you for him personally but he thinks you ought to apologize to the tens of thousands of POWs who were captured by no fault of their own well I've actually done that done and and I've you know frankly I I like John McCain and John McCain is a hero also heroes are people that are you know whether they get caught or don't get caught they're all heroes as far as I'm concerned and that's the way it should be and sort of you regret saying that I don't you know and I I like not to regret anything I mean you know usually you say things and what I said frankly is what I said and you know some people like what I said if you want to know the truth I mean there are many people that like what I said you know after I said that my poll numbers went up seven points I mean no I've done a lot of them do you understand that I mean some people like what I said but I like John McCain and Mike in my eyes John McCain is a hero okay so now he wants it both ways right John McCain he's like quasi apologizes well John McCain's war hero but we'll do you regret saying that no I don't regret saying that because I'm popular because people liked it it made me rise in the polls guess what saying lots of terrible things doing lots of terrible things can make you rise in the polls doing terrible terrible things to people can make you rise in the polls it turns out it turns out that there were places in the United States we're holding slaves and standing for slavery made you rise in the polls today it will help you rise in the polls in California if you say that babies should be boarded the day of birth right you'll rise in New York in the polls if you do as they said yesterday there's a new law in New York that if you are a bartender and a pregnant woman walked into your bar you are not allowed to deny her alcohol maybe this makes you rise in the polls in New York it's also evil because you're now participating you're forcing bartenders to participate in the possible harm to an unborn child right but all these things could make it rise it doesn't make them right doesn't make them right and this might makes right idea from the Trump campaign is really quite troubling it's really problematic because the bottom line is that what's gonna happen now is that as Trump goes forward if he wins if he wins everything that he does now is justified on the basis that he's the president everything that he does is justified on the basis that might makes right and when you're the president you're the most mighty person alive or the most powerful man on planet earth once that's the case nothing he does he says he doesn't like to have regrets no regrets ready he's the Yolo president he's gonna come along and it's Yolo he only gets to do this one time and so you might as well go for broke and you have no way to argue with him because he's popular the people like it and here's the thing about Trump he doesn't even pay attention to the polls so it doesn't even matter whether the people like it right it doesn't even matter whether the people like it you know they he just has this world in which everything he says is popular if he likes what he says it's popular if he doesn't like what he says then somebody made a mistake about it this is the recipe for authoritarianism this is the recipe for for being an authoritarian is the idea that that popularity is equal to decency I get this argument on art all the time by the way and it extends all the way across the board I think there is such a thing as quality I think there is such a thing as good and there's such a thing as bad there's such a thing as moral and there's such a thing as immoral and these things don't change based on their level of popularity they don't you the morality of abortion does not change because a million abortions a year take place in the United States the morality is the same as it ever was you know the fact that that wraps socks is not a that's not affected by the fact that so many Americans think that rap is great it still sucks the fact that so many Americans love Barack Obama doesn't mean that he's a great president popularity is not a reflection of quality popularity is a reflection of quality popularity is a reflection of popularity alone that's all that's all that's happening here and so when Trump says this sort of stuff and when you hear his folks saying well the will of the people must be respected how dare you respective voters listen I disrespect the voters all the time when they make bad decisions the decision doesn't become better just because somebody made it with the majority or plurality in this case the founders fear it exactly this kind of logic the founders thought this stuff was nonsense why do you think we have a constitution there are many countries many liberal Western countries that do not have a constitution why do you think the United States has a constitution the reason is what the reason the reason for a Bill of Rights is because the founders did not trust the people not to be stupid the founders felt like okay there will be a time probably when freedom of speech becomes unpopular that time it turns out is now when freedom of speech becomes unpopular doesn't matter if people don't like it it's still a right it still exists the basis of the Declaration of Independence is not we're rebelling because it's popular to rebell a third of Americans supported rebellion against Great Britain they said we're rebelling because there are certain inalienable rights that adhere to all of us that have been violated by the British crown and we're not going to stand for that right and wrong are not adjudicated based on the popularity of the issue in question and yet that's exactly Trump's entire case right he says I don't even have to apologize for slandering veterans I don't have to apologize for slandering POWs cuz hey I went up in the polls and that's all that matters and you can see and this is the part that scares me you can see everybody in the Republican Party or large segments of the Republican Party falling in line Trump is popular therefore he's right and Coulter with whom I've been friends for a very long time but I'm been very disappointed by N's take on this particular election and I think that she's been saying untrue things about Donald Trump and about his opponents here's Ann Coulter saying that we all need to get on the Trump train or be run over because obviously he's popular um no I think you're absolutely right I think it shows the Trump is being unbelievably gracious he doesn't need to have this meeting he is the party he's the heart and soul of the party and I mean I think he could have just said hope he comes aboard we're gonna have a lot of fun but if he doesn't oh well so no I think it's very nice but I don't think you should waste a lot of time on these meetings going forward he has an election to run but the people are with him and there's no point in meeting with all these generals without armies right so she's saying you shouldn't even bother meeting with Paul Ryan the speaker of the house the speaker of the house which is by the way the most powerful position in Congress she shouldn't buy that Trump should not bother meeting with Paul Ryan because Paul Ryan has said he's not sure he's ready to jump on the Trump train she says he shouldn't even bother because obviously the heart and soul is with Trump and the people are with Trump the people are with Trump is not a good argument it is not a good argument it doesn't mean that he's right it doesn't mean that he doesn't have work to do on his candidacy you know I have to tell you folks I'm very on a very personal level is having this conversation with Andrew Clavin the other day you know when you're in the fight all the time when you're when you fought and left your entire career and now you see the left begin to infiltrate your own party when you begin to see top down daddy government ideas begin to infiltrate your own party it's it's very difficult because a lot of people who you thought were friendly allies it turns out they're not allies they were just fellow travelers and when the but when pedal hits the metal they're willing to break off and do whatever is necessary for them to win politically against their enemies in yeah I've spent more time here's the thing about the Trump supporters I've spent more time in this election second-guessing myself than I think any time in my political life because I fight the left I don't have to second-guess myself I know where they are I know what they're saying I know who they are this new right is something with which I'm not familiar because it's something honestly I didn't believe existed on the right the sort of ugly white nationalist bent that you see online or the no nothing is above Trump that kind of the kind of stupidity of trumps policy positions I didn't think that this was a thing on the right I didn't think this is a thing in the conservative movement and so I spend an awful lot of time thinking okay maybe I've just got it wrong maybe I've just got it wrong maybe Trump isn't what I think he is maybe Trump isn't the sort of authoritarian thug he seems to be maybe Donald Trump is you know he will be better than Hillary Clinton he won't do damage to the Republican brand maybe I'm maybe I'm getting it wrong I don't see that sort of doubt anywhere on the other side of the aisle I don't see that doubt anywhere in the Trump camp the doubt well maybe these critizise critiques of Trump are true maybe there's something that's a little bit off-putting and disquieting about Donald Trump now there are people like Bobby Jindal as we've mentioned or or Dennis Prager or people who say I don't like Trump ADIZ better than Hillary again that's an argument I respect but I'm talking about the ardent Pro Trump people the Arden even as an ardent anti Trump person I spend a lot of time thinking maybe I'm getting this wrong listen I would love to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt except that he doesn't provide me any reason to do so you think I want to be sitting out an election where Hillary clintons on the other side you think that makes me feel good you think it makes me feel good about myself or about my movement that I feel morally compelled to sit out an election or the worst example of democratic corruption in my lifetime is on the other side you think that makes me feel good about myself or makes me feel good about politics or what I do of course it doesn't it's painful it's difficult but it's a I'm fond of saying of course facts don't care about your feelings and Donald Trump is who Donald Trump is Donald Trump in and I don't care how many people website up line up behind him he's still wrong and the things that he says are still well I don't care how many people lights that he called John McCain not a war hero because he was captured I care who likes that that makes those people bad people I don't care how many of you and Donald Trump does this on a routine basis he does it on a routine basis if he knows people like it then he just lets it go I know that I've mentioned before this exchange that Trump had with with Wolf Blitzer I don't think we have it today I think that Clavin played on a show yesterday but but there's there's a there's an exchange that Trump had with Wolf Blitzer about this this journalist Julia Yaffe or yo if it's older than I and she is a journalist for GQ she wrote a piece that was not flattering about Trump or Melania and a bunch of anti-semitic Trump supporters began sending her death threats via mail and on the phone and Trump was on Wolf Blitzer about it and Blitzer asks him about it and Trump says well I don't know anything about those people I don't know anything about those threats but the article was really bad the idea being all these people like me they must be okay Vladimir Putin likes me he must be okay right and wrong change based on whether these people like or dislike Donald Trump Donald Trump's North Star is his own personal popularity that is his moral North Star it's his guidepost right some of us actually use the idea of a godly objective morality that guides us some of us actually used the idea of the Constitution of the United States as our governmental North Star the idea of constitutional Liberty as our governmental North Star Donald Trump's North Star is Donald Trump which means it's constantly moving and the people who follow that North Star are likely to get lost at sea people like in by the way and then that makes me sad to say and you see it all over the place look at this debate between Steven Hayes over the Weekly Standard in Tucker Carlson from Daily Caller this was this is with Bret Baier yesterday and making some headlines because you'll see the debate I think it's an interesting one doesn't we need to back it it does mean you need to rethink your comfortable assumptions about immigration if you're the Republican Party sure but if you have principles if you believe that that we shouldn't it affects banner banner religion don't don't ban a religion you know it's not it's in the country founded on freedom of religion it's not a good idea to mana religion with asterisks no Republicans can't just cast their ancestors and no rephrase because Donald Trump comes around and you know this orange guy suggests that free trade is bad we're gonna throw away a long time I've noticed a lot of principles among Republicans and washer perhaps are there they're hiding them well I would just say look at Europe look at the destruction of Europe under way now what are the lessons we drop doesn't mean need to ban people who are Muslims I agree that's an overstatement and kind of crazy but it does mean keeping your immigration regime the same in the face of happening no but I was equally right no I agree with you entirely I think their need they need to respond to this clearly and they have a vision but but it but if you make the argument you're not making it others have made it that they just cast aside these pillars of conservatism but oh because there's an audience because because Donald Trump is making certain arguments about trade and about other things I think that's unwise and I think that's one of the reasons that you're seeing this resistance from some people they don't want to support somebody who opposes the things that they've fought for and held most dear for years so if open borders is one of the things they hope held most dear for years they're gonna have to give up on it because the country just doesn't support it they've defended it and they need to change okay so he keeps going back to open borders does Tucker Carlson this is such a it's such a trump lie this is this idea that everyone who opposes him opposes him on the basis of open borders policy are you kidding me I've been for a while in long before Trump was I was in favor of restricting immigration long before Trump was look at an interview I did with an Coulter last year on her book adios America about restricting immigration flow know what Steven Hayes is saying and he keeps mentioning free trade and you noticed Tucker Carlson deliberately avoiding talk about free trade right he keeps he keeps going back to immigration he won't talk free trade what Hayes is saying is look there are certain principles that guide us and Tucker Carlson is saying even about immigration there he's saying well it's unpopular just got to abandon it just got to move beyond it truth does not change just because it's unpopular it's still truth but what you're seeing the Republican Party do because it's a vehicle for victory it's not a vehicle for conservatism and this has always been the tension inside the Republican Party a vehicle for conservatism or is it a vehicle for victory right now it's pretty clear this has become a vehicle for victory not a vehicle for conservatism you're seeing all the Republicans jump on board behind Trump including people like Marco Rubio Rubio who again basically suggested that that trumps politics are egregious he says he'll support the nominee to would those reservations keep you do they right now preclude you from endorsing him well I've set out I've signed a pledge that's that I'd support the Republican nominee and I intend to continue to do that but we're look here's a situation that we're in on the one hand the democrat-controlled Senate Republican party and like millions of Republicans who try to reconcile those two things I intend it can live up to the pledge that we made but that said it these are concerns that I have about policy they remain and they're there but you know I I doubt that doesn't mean that Donald needs to change his positions in order to get my support or what-have-you as I said earlier today I think he should be true to what he believes in and continue to campaign on those things and make his case to the American people you know what Marco stick it stick it of course he should change his positions if they're wrong if they're wrong and in this hall I'm gonna support the nominee I signed a pledge you know I'm may be the only person in American commentariat who said that that question was stupid in the first Republican debate that no one should be forced to sign a loyalty pledge to anybody else you should be loyal to principle not to people or organizations loyalty to principle over people or organizations is what keeps people alive loyalty to organizations and individuals leads to death okay leads to legitimate death because if you are more loyal to an organization or a bad guy than you are two basic principles like decency you're going to do very very bad things and that's what the Republican Party is about to do the final the final kind of Domino here is gonna be Paul Ryan there's sort of an open question Paul Ryan is meeting today with Trump not clear how that's going to go Paul Ryan was asked about this yesterday he said well you know we have to unify the party this is his routine he just keeps saying unify the party unify the party this is all prelude to him saying okay well you know in order to unify the party I'm gonna have to back Trump even though he's expressed his reservations here as Paul Ryan look we got a process we're just getting started so the last thing I'm gonna do is say exactly what the end of this process is going to be when we're just beginning this process the point I'll just make one more time is I really believe that if we're going to be successful this fall we have to unify our party we have to go forward with a positive message that Americans see that we have solutions to their problems when seven out of ten Americans don't like the path that this country is on and Hillary Clinton is basically promising to keep going down the same path we have an obligation to merge in to unify around our common principles to offer this country a choice a better way forward and that's going to take some party unification to do that we just finished probably one of the most grueling primaries in in in in in modern history it's going to take some work and that's the kind of work we're dedicated to doing ok so he does unify the party and here is Trump yeah this is why I think all of this is prelude to it to a big conciliation here's Trump last night trying to woo Paul Ryan number one have a lot of respect for Paul and I think we're gonna have a very good meeting I hope he's a very good man he wants what's good for the party and I think we're gonna have very positive results and frankly for him to stay and be chairman ok so he had said earlier that maybe Trump maybe maybe Ryan should removed his chairman of the party because he opposes Trump or has said that he won't support Trump all right so the bottom line is that this could all change I mean tonight if Ryan says he's not endorsing Trump Trump he'll be on O'Reilly talking about how Paul Ryan is a terrible man a chameleon somebody who lies and all the rest of it though the worst liar since since the snake in the garden and we'll get that whole routine okay so bottom line is that might make Wright campaign does have followers because Mike does attract followers Mike does attract followers it doesn't make right however that said Donald Trump is running and there's a new poll out today from Reuters this RuPaul had Hillary up by 13 points last week and now has them running dead even and now has Trump at 40 and it has Hillary at 41% well within the margin of error of course that shows that there is a 19% gap between the between you know that and full voting so what are those other 19% though nobody really knows Trump says that he's gonna run a new sort of operation he says that in this campaign he's not gonna run a data-driven operation he's not going to invest in a robust ground game he's going to invest in his rallies he's gonna have big rallies cuz he's hoping that sort of the free media that he generates is going to be like the primaries he generates big media big rallies and then all these people go out and vote for him sort of spontaneously this seems to me unbelievably stupid you need both you need a good ground game too apparently there are some super PACs who may or may not pick up the slack for it but this is done but Trump again because it's all about look realm game is not about self aggrandizement ground game is about organization from hates that stuff because it requires work it's much easier to just say things on TV and so Trump's one of trumps top aides Paul Manafort he's on TV and he says that that here the Trump is not going to run this thing like a normal campaign listen to what he compares American politics to it's kind of amazing well I'm going to Cleveland on Thursday and Friday we're sitting down with the RNC leadership running the convention and we're going to begin touch to start talking about that we have some ideas but we want to listen but the answer break some eggs all right let's think about the break-in is Reince Priebus it's going to give us an exciting convention come on Donald Trump is going to give ok what do you do do you have movies do you want to gonna put a program together it's not put together yet we know this is the ultimate reality show it's the presidency of the United States and so it will be a program where we will be talking to America about not just Donald Trump with the Republican Party and we put it in ways that we hope will be entertaining but more important more important informative ok so it's going to be like a reality show which it already has been has this been good for American politics this whole reality show does make you feel better that it's turned into a game of Survivor and the only thing we're lacking is Donald Trump trumping naked through the woods is that is that really what what what is making you feel better about American politics Oh trunk look here's one thing about Trump he understands that right now politics has become a reality show he's living inside reality right reality is now the reality show I mentioned The Truman Show yesterday we are all living now in the Truman Show this is the Truman Show we are all inside reality TV this is donald trump's world and we're all strangers in it if we don't believe that so that you know he's got it right we need some more glitz and glamour at the convention the fact that it takes donald trump to do it is sort of amazing okay meanwhile as we say Donald Trump is doing the might makes right campaign Hillary is just falling apart she's terrible at all of this and even her own people are looking at her and saying what is wrong with you Joe Biden came out this morning on Good Morning America he said yeah you know I probably would've been a better president I had planned on running it's an awful thing to say I think I would have been the best president but it was the right thing not just my family for me I no one should ever seek the presidency unless they're able to devote their whole heart and soul and passion into just doing that and Beau was my soul I just wasn't ready to be able to do that my one regret is my Beau's not here I don't have any other okay so he says that he wishes that he'd run basically and if he had run he would have beaten Hillary excuse me and then he probably also would have won the election so if he had run he probably would have been the president but she's in trouble and that's why you're seeing these people feeling free or to speak about it Bernie Sanders he's come out and he says he's not quitting he's not going anywhere he says the polls show that he's continues to that he not only would he beat Hillary he'd beat Trump if you look over the last month or six weeks and every national poll Bernie Sanders defeats Donald Trump by big numbers but it is not only national polls where we defeat Trump by bigger numbers than Secretary Clinton it is state Paul after state poll after state poll just in the last day just in the last night two national polls have us beating Trump by bigger margins than Secretary Clinton he's okay he's now doing the reverse Trump routine he's saying that I would crush Trump and the polls show at the poles the poles the poles the poles okay so Hillary's got a problem and even her own biggest supporters are saying she has a problem George Stephanopoulos the Keebler Elf who said in his in his autobiography that he loves Hillary Clinton George Stephanopoulos he says these losses she lost in West Virginia last night in the West Virginia primary because she was stupid enough to say several years ago that she wanted to put coal miners out of jobs just a genius thing to say here is Hillary here's George Stephanopoulos lamenting the fact that his former boss has some problems Bernie Sanders cannot catch up tank at 98 percent of the delegates and the Clinton team is explaining away this loss in West Virginia but it is bogging her campaign down well yeah you know they say they did not advertise in West Virginia they say the demographics favor him there but the reality is she's got a real problem going forward she's had a hard time winning over white working-class voters George and that as you know is a group that Donald Trump has done especially well so even Democrats beginning to acknowledge now that Hilary is a terrible candidate and has problems Chris Matthews said the same thing last night or never w stay got abreast of this show and then he says let's talk about Hillary and her problems his campaign go the early elections in 50s and 60s in the Kennedy races and I have to tell you back then and being a Democrat was great you talked about unemployment how by job she's not putting people to work he talked minimum wage you talked about Medicare now you got to talk about guns which the people don't want to hear you gotta talk about how a coal was bad for the country in the bad for the world you gotta talk about same-sex in a part of the country that isn't too keen on that kind of abortion so all of a sudden you're talking about things that aren't really well-received but the old days a Democrat could just say a lot of poverty here let's do something about it and and he's saying basically that Hillary can say those things but Trump is also saying those same things this is why if the Republican Party is a vehicle for victory basically you just make it the Democratic Party when we put a loudmouth in charge and yeah everything is happy to happy do the Democrats have a problem here I mean listen I'm a never Trump guy in the sense that I and I said I wouldn't vote for Trump if as he currently stands that was never based on the idea Trump can't win there are some people who say Trump can't win you know my head says that he's gonna have a tough time winning but he could certainly win I mean there's there certainly a possibility that he can win the point of not voting for him is that I don't want him to win I don't want Hillary to win either I want both of them to drift off in a lifeboat somewhere in the middle of the city I think that would probably be the best solution for America but debbie Wasserman Schultz she's now in the position that Mitt Romney's campaign was in the last days of the of the 2012 campaign jar jar binks debbie Wasserman Schultz she says that she no longer trusts the polls she doesn't put a lot of stock in the polls that show the Trump is doing well against Hillary what's embarrassing is that the Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump doesn't have the support of the speak of his own Speaker of the House doesn't have support of either bush president has many United States senators and candidates questioning or outright rejecting that they're going to attend their own party's convention because Donald Trump is radioactive and they know it the national polls are a little a little early to be hanging your hat on national polls but the polls that I have seen across the board the Quinnipiac result is an outlier but I'm in in may not not one that puts a lot of thought in the polls okay so as she's saying the polls don't exist anymore even though three days ago she was saying that Trump was getting crushed in all the polls that she was gonna run to victory so Hillary has some problems of her own and in you know so this could be a competitive election the part again about Trump that scares me is that the authoritarian nature of Trump he never apologized I'm right because I'm winning routine is it's not good for American politics in any sense okay time for some things that I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like I haven't I can't fully vouch for this yet I can't fully vouch for this yet I'll have to listen to it but our producer Malthus has a podcast called hello and adieu and I suggest you check it out it looks like fun it's it's all culture talk it's he I guess the latest episode is talking about Captain America it's him and his best friend they live across the country and they talk to each other so that's kind of fun so check that out his podcast hello and to do if it sucks I'll come back and I'll put in the things I hate like a couple of days from now so let you know but but for now it's in the things that I like other things that I like there's a movie that came out that it really did not get I thought the plaudits that it deserved a couple of years ago I'm a huge Christopher Nolan fan and I think that this is his best film although he's made many really good films yeah Dark Knight's hard to say this is better than Dark Knight but this is this is a really really good film that was underrated by a lot of people because they thought that it was too bulky and they didn't like the plotting is the movie interstellar with Matthew McConaughey which I thought was just a riveting film it's not twice I rarely see films twice and here's the trailer for those who missed it are you gonna do it I'm gonna give it something socially responsible can't we just let it go this thing needs to learn how to adapt Murph five-game was masked up like the rest of us so basically if you can't see the visuals you're missing you know everything that's good here the visuals are treasured we've spent hours to leave for a while now your daughter's generation will be the last to survive on earth you're the best pilot we ever had get out there a safer world they really say goodbye to our solar system to our galaxy here we go it's really good so stop there it's really good the bottom line is that what the premise of the movie is that earth is having an environmental crisis basically people are going to die and so we need to find a different place to live and so they go out and investigate it's Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway they go out and they investigate other universes for places that human beings can live and it's cool and it's spirituals it's a really it's a really neat movie I like it a lot okay other things that I like on the lighter side there's this I don't know if you've seen this clip sometimes local news just provides you joy and this is a local news clip from Kentucky where apparently there's some sort of tornado and if you can't see this you're missing the joy also this is why you need to subscribe it's daily wire but there's a man who has to be a hundred and eleven years old standing there and he's wearing a shirt that says young and getting it and it's a stepping and just play a little bit of this clip because it's pretty ridiculous straight to us and when I said Jesus Jesus Jesus that John nator went up over his bed you guys are very lucky thank you for talking with us Jesus Jesus Jesus the tornado went up and over his van is this black lady standing next to a guy who is 190,000 years old we're pretty awesome okay a couple of things that I hate Baltimore's mayor just did this routine where she banned travel to North Carolina for all government employees of course nobody needs to ban travel to Baltimore because no one's going to Baltimore okay no one wants any part of Baltimore so someone suggested online some Twitter file or mine suggested online I think this is right the North Carolina should just identify itself self-identify as Baltimore and then really put the mayor of Baltimore in a bind it would really be a problem I may not be Baltimore but if identifies as Baltimore we have to treat it as Baltimore correct so that's that's that's all very exciting other things that I hate Samantha bee has this show on TBS and you knew it was gonna suck you knew from the first moment you saw it it was going to be bad it had its tagline was something like if you don't watch this you're a sexist and you just knew it was gonna be lefty garbage so she has on absolute roll Patton Oswalt who is in fact like a human he's like a troll in human form and Patton Oswalt yeah I've gotten into it on Twitter a little bit because he's very very wealthy socialist who refuses to answer how much he's worth and how much he gave to charity last year a patton oswalt was on with samantha bee and they just make fun of pro-life pregnancy centers these are places that women who are pregnant go to get more information about their about their child and patton oswalt thinks this is just awful it's just the worst thing that ever happened the best cons are the lies that hide in plain sight the electoral college god but tonight we'll look at both sides of the coin the truth and the illusion it's not funny at all by the way we are casting our gaze toward the ultimate hustle a conception deception a masterpiece of guile illogical grift crisis pregnancy centers a crisis pregnancy center is a fake abortion clinic they spread these lies hoping to frighten women and to persuade them not to go ahead with obtaining the abortion that they want they create the illusion that there are an abortion clinics illusion by adopting names that are similar to abortion clinics adopting the same Lobos and fonts copperplate gothic bold they try to have women come in to have a free pregnancy test or free ultrasound and then their goal is to detain them so I ended up at a crisis pregnancy center after looking in the Yellow Pages I chose that listening because it was the largest ad they locate next to an abortion clinic sometimes in the same building they con women into thinking that they provide the full range of reproductive health care services when they absolutely do not I didn't feel like when I was in the facility for the ultrasound that I was talking to a real nurse giving me real medical information about my body most of these fake clinics do not have licensed medical staff women are often given false ultrasound results ok ok so we can stop it here so the highs make these these crisis pregnancy centers are the worst is the worst place on earth first of all it would be illegal to impersonate a medical professional without a license ok that's illegal so you can import that and these people would be prosecuted that's number one number two they say they give them false ultrasound results ok Planned Parenthood refuses to perform 3d ultrasounds they refused they they've stumped against 3d ultrasounds because they're afraid that women are gonna look at their babies and realize that their baby's gay one even if you were to grant all of these premises right it would be bad you don't want to deceive people because lying is not worthwhile but even if you were to grant all these premises lying in order to get a woman not to kill her baby seems to me less objectionable than lying to a woman in order to get her to kill her baby which is what Planned Parenthood actually does so you know but this is how the media treat all of this of the media are really quite terrible ok the last thing that I want to talk about that I really dislike here is um well I know I have to decide she played the most ridiculous Trump question in history from Fox & Friends or should we do Joe Biden talking about cancer Lyndsey which one Biden about cancer or Trump okay it's always Trump okay so Fox and Friends asked Donald Trump legitimately the most ridiculous question in television history yesterday here's what it looked like this morning Donald Trump do you think you had something to do with Budweiser changing the name of their beer for the summer they wouldn't I think so they're so impressed with what our country will become that they decided to do this before the fact yeah okay so Trump says Trump replies as he should with a joke but they're asking Trump of course Budweiser is going to rename itself America for the summer and and so he's asked whether they think that they've renamed Budweiser after Donald Trump's campaign slogan yes yes this is how our media treat things these days but don't buy the hype folks it turns out the truth is still truth lies are still lies and doesn't matter who's speaking truth and who's speaking lies all the matters what is a truth and what is a lie you don't just get to follow the person who you think is going to be the nicest to you or the person who is the most popular speaking of popularity we'll be back tomorrow with them vaunted mailbag where apparently I am both unpopular and deeply unpopular this week so we'll talk about all of that I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
