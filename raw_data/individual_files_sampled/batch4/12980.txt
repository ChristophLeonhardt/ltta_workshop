in a horrific act of anti-muslim terrorism a 48 year old man drove a van into a group of Muslims near a mosque in Finsbury Park in London on Sunday he shouted I want to kill all Muslims I did my bit you deserve it one man was killed 10 others were wounded according to the Daily Mail quote the unnamed man who was clean-shaven with curly hair and wore white t-shirt suffered cuts to his face and hands and was filmed repeatedly shouting killing me - the men who grabbed him after his arrest the terrorist suspect continued to goad the crowds that witnessed the attack by smiling waving and even blowing kisses at them the incidents horrific the perpetrator should spend the rest of his life in prison because the UK has no death penalty the left isn't wrong to connect it with an upsurge in anti-muslim crime according to London Mayor Sadiq Khan who has been far too permissive with regard to Islamic radicalism on his own soil he released police figures that showed according to Newsweek quote Islamophobic attacks had risen fivefold since the ramming and knife assault a 40% increase in racist attacks the numbers from London's Metropolitan Police show that anti-muslim motivated incidents had risen to a daily 2017 average of four to as many as 20 but it is wrong to use the anti-muslim attack as justification for the equivalency between the dangers of the rise of radical Islam and the rise of anti-muslim xenophobia that is absurd yes attacks on Muslims have risen and that is unjustifiable and awful major attacks on Muslims by anti Muslim terrorists are far less common however than major radical Muslim attacks on non-muslims across Europe and they are supported by no major terrorist group let alone state actors radical Muslims run state anti Muslim countries do not exist in the same way even the most extreme anti Muslim countries have Muslim populations for example this London attack marks the first major terror attack in Great Britain against Muslims since 2013 when a ukrainian student attempted to bomb a mosque in birmingham and stabbed the young muslim man to death if I miss when I apologize in advance in the last four months however we've seen the Westminster terror attack the Manchester Arena bombing and the London Bridge attack this is not to suggest that violence anti-muslim terror attacks are somehow better or less disgusting than violent radical Muslim terror attacks on others but they are far less statistically frequent have nearly no global support and earn the round condemnation of the entire Western world the left has attempted to broaden the conversation to include individual hate crimes for example harassing a woman in the hijab but if we do that we also have to include the rate of hate crimes by Muslims against others eg Jews across Europe we have a moral obligation to fight against terrorism wherever we see it but to pretend that a widespread anti-muslim terror network is spreading across the West organized or disorganized is a deliberate misreading of the situation by people who are politically motivated to waive away the continuing threat of radical Muslim terrorism i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show all right so we have a lot to talk about today I want to talk about what looks like it could be looming war over Syria president Trump seems to be in a position where the Russians are now trying to push them around in Syria so we'll talk about that momentarily we'll also talk about megyn kelly and Alex Jones and I want to talk a fair bit today about the situation with these alt-right protestors storming the stage Julius Caesar Chase for the parks I think is indicative of something else that's happening in the modern right wing movement that is troubling to say the least but before we get to any of that I first want to say thank you to our sponsors over at MVM t / MV mt so movement watches was founded on the belief that style should not break the bank and this watch right here

also that will ensure that they know that we sent you so they'll continue to advertise the program and make it possible for us to do the show okay so lots and lots of breaking news happening in in the news today so we talked about this terror attack in London I want to lead off with that specifically because I think it's important for those of us who are on the right to point out when these sorts of attacks occur because terror is terror is terror that doesn't mean the terror movements are all the same it doesn't mean the terror is the same danger from all quarters but it is important to mention when a terror attack like this occurs because otherwise we're not being we're not being objective or honest in in what's happening around the world okay other big news today is that the Russian government is basically now threatening war with the United States over Syria which is you know I think they're bluffing I think there's a pretty solid shot that they are bluffing but it's dangerous anyway obviously right now if you if you look at the situation basically in Syria you've got the Kurds all the way up in the north and then in the West you have the you have I mean in the east you have Isis which is a big block of territory in the east and then the rest of the country sort of the everywhere from the southeast to the northwest is split between the Free Syrian Army though via the Syrian rebels and Bashar Assad's government Bashar Assad's government is being propped up right now by Vladimir Putin so here at the situation according to CNN on Sunday an American jet shot down a Syrian jet the shoot down came a little more than two hours after forces allied with the Syrian regime of Bashar al-assad attacked in north-central Syrian town of Judean which was controlled by the Syrian Defense Forces in accordance with rules of engagement and in collective self-defense of coalition partner forces the Syrian jet was immediately shot down by a u.s. f f/a 18 e super hornet so I hope that I'm reading that correctly it indicates we shot down a Syrian jet and the Russians immediately threatened retaliation the Russian Defense Ministry announced quote all kinds of airborne vehicles including aircraft and UAVs of the International Coalition detected west of Euphrates River which includes part of Iraq will be tracked by the Russian sa M systems as the air targets so they're threatening to start shooting American planes once they start threatened to shoot down American planes then we are on the brink of war which is obviously a frightening scenario this was created by Barack Obama this has nothing to do with President Trump President Trump did say during the campaign to Hillary Clinton that her attempt to her suggestion we set up a no-fly zone over Syria could lead to World War three now it appears that we are engaging in an air war with Syrians that is I think a bad move actually by President Trump and I think we have to acknowledge the risks that are entailed here David French has suggested partition of the country we support the Kurds up north to create their own independent state and that we guarantee air coverage over that area and that we guarantee air coverage over various other areas but we're playing a dangerous game of chicken with the Russians and this is all because Barack Obama never had a Russian strategy a Syrian strategy and didn't do anything back in 2013 when he could have and should have so again I can't blame President Trump for the two and I won't blame President Trump for a situation he was handed by his unbelievably incompetent predecessor again I don't think there's any long-lasting great solution here but the only solution here is going to be something that nobody really likes very much okay so the big news over the weekend at least in the domestic political area was that there are these all Trent protestors who have decided to run up on stage at the Julius Caesar production and Shakespeare in the Park know we talked about this production last week this is the production where the julius caesar part is staged clearly as President Trump his wife is staged clearly as Melania Trump and then he is assassinated now for those who don't know the play the basic concept of the plays the Julius Caesar is has overweening ambition but is assassinated by a bunch of senators who want to restore the Republic and then the entire thing breaks down the assassination of Caesar is not seen in a particularly good light in the play the assassination of Caesar is seen as a big mistake by Brutus Cassius and all the conspirators and the Roman mob is basically whipped into a frenzy by Mark Antony to permanently end democracy and Republic and republicanism in Rome so at the very least you know if you read the play it is not clear that the play is in favor of Trump quote there's no Trump caesar being assassinated but the imagery is disturbing obviously we played it last week and it I think is an obvious and silly representation by the people to do the play it is not however linked and this is this annoys me it is not advocacy or defensive violence and it is not linked it is not linked to the assassination attempts on congressional members by this far left anti-trump guide there is no evidence whatsoever that he went and saw the plane then was inspired to do this even if there had been I'm deeply uncomfortable with this notion that if you listen to Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh and then you go shoot somebody that is Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh's fault if they're not advocating violence it is not their fault it is a game that we can we can play all day long but it's a stupid game and it's a counterproductive game so nonetheless there are a bunch of people who want to get their name in the paper so they've decided they're going to rush up onstage at these events now I am against as a general rule snowflake er II of all forms I don't like when people rush onstage when I am speaking I would be a hypocrite if I said it was okay for people to rush on stage when someone else is speaking the justification people use when they rush up on stage and try to shut down my speeches or Ann Coulter speeches or milos or Charles Murray's or ayaan Hirsi Ali s or Heather McDonald's whenever they do that's what they say they're trying to prevent hate speech because that hate speech will generate violence this is always their excuse always and here is what it looks like when they do these things and it is bad okay this is what happened in Cal State LA back in February 2015 here is what happened and this is how it's written kyoool and there it is gang that's what you know what they're not going to stop us they pulled the fire alarm in the middle of the speech we had footage but there's a big riot outside basically people were assaulting people in the crowd it was disgusting then it is disgusting now okay here is protesters blocking the State University of Wisconsin this is very similar to what just happened at Shakespeare in the Park I was being the University of Wisconsin a bunch of protesters decided to get up and shout at me and disrupt the proceeding that police wouldn't do anything about it and then they all stood in front of the stage and they started blocking the proceedings here's what that looked like okay so again you know this notion that I'm unfamiliar with people doing this sort of thing is ridiculous or the notion that I am somehow against this sort of stuff because of cowardice I go on college campus campuses all the time and I speak to crowds in which this kind of stuff occurs it is always stupid it is always gross it is all these counts are productive it is always anti-free speech over to pol university I risked arrest to walk onto campus here is what it looked like when they when the administration there decided that they would not let me even enter the campus to speak now I want to point something out after they informed me that they would arrest me because it would be trespassed it's a private university I don't have a right to be there so I left here is what that looked like just to be just to be clear if I attempt to enter that hall right there and sit down just to listen to somebody speak or if I attempt to ask a questions or to engage in free speech you will have me arrested Victor disappointment okay and so I took all of the people from the fall we went to a place off campus where we then proceeded to engage in our free speech events anyway so all of that is prelude to what happened at Shakespeare parking the reason I put that out there is number one because I have lived this experience many times and number two because it is wrong when the left does it and it is similarly stupid and wrong when the right does it okay here is what happened this is on Friday evening the thing is Jack plus a biga did but day I don't really know how to he is or his name until he started tweeting at me and Laura Laura Lauren Jeb Big Jim don't know who they are but in any case they stormed the stage and they make a big deal out of it and now they're raising all sorts of money for themselves here's the first alt right storming of the stage engine seven we're going to call I'm going to pause security or anything they're shouting liberal he kills and this is violent and then pass a pajama do he gets up and he starts shouting how everybody is devils and everyone here is the Nazi everyone here is Devils because they come to watch a production of Julius Caesar in which the current leader of the country is portrayed as Julius Caesar which by the way happened in 2011 when a Minneapolis theatre portrayed President Obama as this now I thought it was ridiculous and stupid when the left went insane after a rodeo clown in Missouri dressed up as President Obama the left went nuts it was ridiculous then it is ridiculous now for people to go crazy over a piece of art that they don't like it's really really stupid but that's not stopping the right from now engaging in the same sort of snowflake array and make let me make something clear if any people have been acting like this is oh well you know we're just using their tactics against them no that's not what this is okay that's not what this is because even if the web stops shutting down my speeches or an speeches or my low speeches or any of the rest of these presumably these alt-right protestors would still go and do this stuff they would still go and do it why not because they're trying to demonstrate that the tactic is wrong they're doing it because they are offended by the content which makes them right-wing snowflakes although they're not even really right-wing because I have yet to identify the right wing principles other than that they don't like the left it's just it's just insane here's the Laura Ingraham tweeting about this actually tweeted quote the left doesn't like it when their tactics are used against their expression how many would storm stage if Obama was stabbed okay first of all in Minneapolis none of them stormed the stage but second of all if they did I would say that was bad and stupid I would say that is a dumb thing to do because you don't have a right to destroy people's place of business you don't have a right to interfere with someone else's freedom of speech now this is not the same thing as establishing a mutually assured destruction with regard to boycotts for example I have a right to do with my money what I want you have the right to do with your money what you want if you want to boycott chick-fil-a and I want a boycott MSNBC that is perfectly within our purview what I cannot do and what you cannot do you can't walk down to chick-fil-a occupy the place okay when black lives matter did that to a bunch of brunches in New York City it was stupid it was council and it was gross and by the way it led people to react by electing Donald Trump Trump's response to this kind of behavior by the way was not to go and shut down leftist events it was to point out that the left was shutting down his event which was eminently correct so for all the people who keep saying well we have to use their strategies because they're winning no they are not they've lost over a thousand seats all across the country Trump is the president and we and Republicans control the Congress as well as the Senate the notion that the left is winning because of an cephas snow-flakes because of the people at University of Wisconsin shutting things down it's just idiocy it's just idiocy so no that's not even strategically is not some sort of strategic genius so they do it again on Sunday night and of course again because so much of the right has become tribal instead of smart or conservative there are a lot of people who have defended this activity which I'll show you in a second so here's the second protest or jumping on stage on Sunday night those will be crowd liberal hate kills liberal hate kills I've been on the receiving end of this routine from the web okay verbiage does not kill words are not violent and the minute preached to dismiss for years okay the minute you start suggesting that words are violence we grow ever closer to violence the minute you start suggesting that simple political discourse this course you don't like is equivalent to violence then you are justifying violence in the name of shutting down that discourse it's disgusting and it's wrong okay it's wrong and it's just as wrong as when what does it I don't understand why I have to explain this to people who are conservatives and are supposed to be grounded in a judeo-christian value system that suggests the value of other human beings and the value of free speech it's really quite disgusting and horrifying okay then a guy gets up and he starts yelling that CNN is Isis at this situation very helpful I sort of point something out every keeps shouting about Devils okay let me point them how about Devils in the Nazi what they actually used to do is shut down Marxist events okay there was a Marxist political event they would send stormtroopers to shut it down and not when they were in the knot when they were elected okay like independent little Antipa type groups this is just it's just on but Sean Hannity who again I love Sean Hannity as a person but Sean is is I think I think he's pandering to the worst group of people on the right Sean Hannity tweets this right so Sean is tweeting about this last night I tweeted this has to say he tweeted wild might liberal hate kills chance protester okay now Sean gives opinions for loving his an opinion host he is not an objective journalist when I called him on this and I said this is this is I said the left chance conservative hate conservative hate kills and you call them snowflakes which is right stop with this stupidity and then Sean tweeted back been the only person being stupid here is you I was tweeting exactly what was said with video I'm mature enough to let people decide but you have an opinion give an opinion on this Sean I mean and then later Sean did express his opinion which is that he thinks it's perfectly fine that they shut this thing down because it was disrespectful to the President of the United States and in his opinion it was forwarding violence again I'm going to be god forbid somebody should shoot a person on the Left who in and the shooter happens to be somebody who once listened to Sean Hannity show I was somebody who two weeks ago two freakin weeks ago two weeks ago folks I was sitting here defending Sean Hannity from boycott over the Seth rich stuff okay but the entire left was going after him and what did Sean say he said just because I was covering store in a particular way doesn't mean that the leopard targeted me for destruction okay so that all of this is is highly irritating and I want to talk about a few more points I have to make on this before I get to how the left has reacted to the shooting people F is reacting just as abysmally as you would expect them to but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at upside comm so if you are into

gift card for free and you can go check it out right now and remember use that promo code okay so a couple of more points on this because I think that this is important I think he goes deep to the heart of what the conservative movement wants to be do we want to be a movement that suggests that we are going to shut down the Left own we don't like what they say or are we going to be a movement that actually has some principles now there are a lot of people on the right who have been who started using this phrase my principles muh principles ma prince like as opposed to my principles and the idea is that your baby because you're whining about mo principles oh you have principles too if you're one of these people your principles too but you need to name them for me because those principles obviously don't include the idea that you don't get to destroy somebody's establishment just because you don't like what they're saying I assume and now you say your principle is winning that's not a principle that is a goal okay a principle is something that you are willing to lose to up home okay what are you willing to sacrifice in order to uphold the principle I am willing to sacrifice the notion that a play offends me based on the principle that you shouldn't shut down free speech even for people I don't like I'm willing to sacrifice that by the way I don't think they're winning because of that ok freedom of speech speech is a principle storming my speeches storming plate it is wrong it's wrong whether we do it it is wrong whether they do it not the same thing as an economic boycott and there's that other principle that I mentioned too that words are not violence I've spent my entire career saying words are not violence the left says they are violence and now we've got half the right saying that words are violence this is the predicate to legislation to tamp down on speech in order this is how you get to Canada you wonder how you get to Canadian version of free speech or people get sued for things that they don't like okay the reason is because they're a bunch of people who say that it causes violence and then there's the tactical argument so my friend John Nolte who I love John okay but John wrote this piece today attacking me by name and because as daily wire I want to have a site where we have a multiplicity of viewpoints I printed it he used them up principles line I printed it I disagreed with every word of it including and and the he talks about how these people storming Julius Caesar it was like Lincoln suspending habeas corpus okay this this is just ridiculous to me for a couple of reasons one Lincoln suspended habeas corpus during an actual Civil War like there was a war on if we're going to use wartime morality and peacetime we're pretty soon going to be in a war like there will be an actual war if we use wartime morality in peacetime hey don't quote Sherman unless you're willing to burn Atlanta furthermore today we're going to pretend that the left is winning because they as John says break windows her legs shoot us shout us down they're not they're losing because of all of this the more extreme the left becomes the more they lose the leptin sandy drug the right to victory across the country let's not pretend the donald trump came along and suddenly the right one the right had won a thousand seats across the country the right hand won back the house and the Senate before donald trump was even mentioned as a presidential candidate okay Trump did a lot of good things one of the things he did was he called out the weapon he did this stuff one of the things he did not do was attempt to shut down left his speech John asked for our plans and so what's your plan if you're not storming stages here's my plan speak on college campuses point out to the press as loudly and as often as possible when they refuse to allow us to speak and by the way it works Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren Barack Obama all have come out against the college snowflake er II that is now being evidenced from the right and finally there's morality tactics question okay some of these tactics are just not moral okay they are not doing this again because they are attempting to stop the left from doing it they are doing it because they are offended if you are trying to shut down someone's free speech because you are offended you are the problem you are the snowflake you're the person doing something wrong okay now as we continue here I want to talk about the the left response to the shootings because the fallout from that is just insane the left has lost its mine as well but in order for you to see that you're going to have to go over and subscribe over at daily wire comm $8 a month got to go subscription to daily wire lots of
