the US the Netherlands and the UK have accused Russia's GRU military intelligence service of a string of cyberattacks on everyone from the International chemical weapons watchdog to Russia's own news agency and it didn't take long for the EU and NATO to join the chorus of claims there were hundreds of victims targeted by these Russian criminals the Russian government needs to know indiscriminate campaign exposed I want to fully condemn this attack this irresponsible behavior from Moscow let's now cross live to caleb Maupin to hear about the reaction from washington what's been said there Caleb any new evidence well we've got seven Russians who've been charged by the US Department of Justice with money laundering identity theft wire fraud and hacking now the indictment actually says that they did it on behalf of Russia's GRU let's take a listen to what exactly is being alleged these seven defendants are charged with a pervasive campaign of hacking stealing private and sensitive information and publicizing that information to retaliate against Russia's detractors and sway public opinion and Russia's favor now according to the allegations made by the Department of Justice they're saying that these individuals targeted people for allegedly calling for a ban of Russian athletes from the Olympics in response to the doping scandal they also allegedly targeted a nuclear energy company based in Pennsylvania now it's also important to note very important that three out of the seven Russians who have been charged have already been charged in previous indictments from the Bob Muller investigation so these are individuals that have already been named by the Department of Justice in previous indictments so that's what we're looking at this has all been alleged the absorbents are coming down from the Department of Justice Arty's Caleb Maupin thank you for bringing us that report now as Caleb mentioned the US has indicted seven people four were expelled from the Netherlands according to this morning's he ringg poli Boyka has more on the findings of the dutch and UK investigations these are for Russians that were recently expelled from the Netherlands for attempting to hack the OPCW in April while it was dealing with the investigation into the poisoning of Sergey and Yulia scrapple they released images of these four suspects in the Netherlands their diplomatic passports and at the very same briefing in briefing in The Hague the British ambassador to the Netherlands accused the GRU of attempting to hack Porton Down which is the UK's military laboratory here in the UK and the UK Foreign Office in the wake of the script Powell case thus crippled poisoning and they accused GRU agents of attempting to hack the investigation into the downing of flight mh17 as well that's a lot of allegations for one day but it doesn't stop there take a listen to what the British defense secretary Gavin Williamson had to say about Moscow this is not the actions of a great power this is a vey actions of the pariah state and will continue working with allies to isolate them make them understand they cannot continue to conduct themselves in such a way why is he calling Russia a pariah state well because the British government released a statement overnight accusing the GRU of being responsible for the hacking of wada that's the world anti-doping agency in the wake of the Russian doping scandal they've accused GRU agents of being behind the hack on the dnc that's those Clinton emails that we leaked in the run-up to the election of Donald Trump over in the US and they also accuse Russian spies of hacking Ukrainian and Russian institutions and businesses russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria's a whore of a spoke a little bit earlier on today and she asked she was asked about these British accusations the Dutch and the American ones hadn't come to light yet and she said that all the accusations against Russia in sent months have been conflated take a listen to what she had to say dis Borel everything is being mixed indiscriminately as if in a bottle of Nina Ricci perfume Russian military intelligence cyber spies Kremlin hackers vada it's all just one big witches brew the imagination of our British colleagues knows no limits who could come up with all this I'd like to take a look at this Hans Christian Andersen's one more thing is that the Dutch government has also called in the top diplomat in the Netherlands it shouted affair they're into the Dutch foreign ministry in order to discuss the cyber attacks we had a chance to speak to Russia's envoy to the UK he says from the British side the evidence is still lacking we believe that this kind of statements are reckless and I explained why first of all this statements are not supported by any evidence this is first second we hear this kind of allegations for quite an hour quite a time and in December 2017 when four former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was in Moscow Sergey Lavrov Russian Foreign Minister offered him to have a consultations on the cyber security and he said that if you have any questions in connection with the alleged Russian activity we can put these specialists from two countries sit down on the table and discuss professionally what are the concerns of the British side the British refused to do this and instead of that they launched reckless attacks on us without any evidence this is quite a big story you know this is the name of the Russian intelligence organization you know a few names that I expelled and all these things but the beef I mean this this substance is not basically given so we're going to ask the British side to give more information on that and you
