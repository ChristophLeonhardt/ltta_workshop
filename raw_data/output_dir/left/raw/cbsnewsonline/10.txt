1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:09,175
STATES SENATE, JACKY ROSEN.  

2
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,944
YOU GUYS GO AHEAD AND TAKE A 

3
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:11,311
SEAT. 

4
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:20,286
I'VE GOT A LOT TO SAY. 

5
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:22,255
NOW, FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE TO 

6
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:27,961
SAY THAT -- I MISS YOU, TOO! 

7
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:33,500
I DO. 

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,300
FIRST OF ALL, LOOK. 

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,735
I'M NOT ALONE IN SAYING I ENJOY 

10
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:39,639
COMING TO LAS VEGAS. 

11
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:40,373
OTHER AMERICANS ALSO ENJOY 

12
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,175
COMING TO VEGAS. 

13
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,511
YOU CAN GET ANYTHING YOU WANT 

14
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:47,981
RIGHT HERE IN VEGAS. 

15
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,716
SOME THINGS YOU SHOULDN'T WANT. 

16
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,618
A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE GOOD 

17
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:52,552
FOR YOU. 

18
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,554
OUTSTANDING FOOD. 

19
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,889
GREAT SHOWS. 

20
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,691
YOU NAME IT. 

21
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,293
AND THEN, WE BROUGHT SOME SHOWS 

22
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,060
HERE TODAY. 

23
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:16,209
WHO DOESN'T LOVE SALT N PEPA? 

24
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,677
WHO DOESN'T LOVE JAKE BALDWIN 

25
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:23,015
AND  REGGAETON? 

26
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:26,186
I WAS BACKSTAGE.  

27
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,020
FORTUNATELY THERE WERE NO 

28
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,790
CAMERAS WHEN I WAS GOING. 

29
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,192
SO, LAS VEGAS IS KNOWN FOR ITS 

30
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:32,525
HOSPITALITY. 

31
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:33,826
IT'S KNOWN FOR ITS SPIRIT OF 

32
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:34,127
FUN. 

33
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,595
IT'S KNOWN FOR ITS OUTSTANDING 

34
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,298
PEOPLE. 

35
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,766
IT'S KNOWN FOR ITS SUNNY 

36
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,635
WEATHER. 

37
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,370
BUT, THERE IS ONE OTHER THING 

38
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,173
THAT I WANT LAS VEGAS AND ALL 

39
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:50,243
OF NEVADA TO BE KNOWN FOR. 

40
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,378
AND THAT IS FOR VOTING. 

41
00:01:52,378 --> 00:02:00,520
I WANT THIS TO BE THE CAPITAL OF

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:00,920
VOTING. 

43
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,590
I'M HERE JUST TO GET ONE THING  

44
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,190
FROM YOU. 

45
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,758
AND THAT IS FOR YOU TO VOTE. 

46
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:10,597
LOOK. 

47
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,498
THIS NOVEMBER'S ELECTIONS ARE 

48
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:12,632
MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY I CAN 

49
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,234
REMEMBER IN MY LIFETIME. 

50
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,236
AND THAT INCLUDES WHEN I WAS ON 

51
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:20,206
THE BALLOT. 

52
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:20,807
THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING. 

53
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,608
POLITICIANS SAY EVERY TIME, 

54
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,642
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 

55
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:22,908
ELECTION. 

56
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:24,210
THIS ONE IS REALLY THAT 

57
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:24,677
IMPORTANT. 

58
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,614
THE STAKES ARE HIGH. 

59
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:32,385
THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANYBODY HERE

60
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,553
NOT TURNING OUT, AND DOING 

61
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,954
EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO GET YOUR 

62
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,055
FRIENDS NEIGHBOR'S FAMILY TO 

63
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:40,460
TURN OUT, THE CONCERT IS -- 

64
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,261
CONSEQUENCES OF YOU STAYING 

65
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:45,331
HOME WOULD BE PROFOUNDLY 

66
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,432
DANGEROUS TO THIS COUNTRY, TO 

67
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:46,832
OUR DEMOCRACY. 

68
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:48,033
WE'VE HAD CHALLENGING MOMENTS 

69
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:49,369
BEFORE. 

70
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,870
DEMOCRACY HAS NEVER BEEN EASY. 

71
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,038
OUR FOUNDERS ARGUED ABOUT 

72
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:57,477
EVERYTHING. 

73
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,778
WE WAGED A CIVIL WAR FOR 

74
00:02:58,778 --> 00:02:59,044
FREEDOM. 

75
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:02,048
WE OVERCAME A GREAT DEPRESSION. 

76
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,385
WE HAD TO FIGHT FOR WORKERS 

77
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,553
RIGHTS AND NEIGHBORS RIGHTS AND 

78
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:11,524
CIVIL RIGHTS AND LGBT RIGHTS. 

79
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,260
AND, THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHERE

80
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,096
WE WENT INTO EREZ OF 

81
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:17,964
CONSERVATIVE TREACHERY. 

82
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,467
AND, WE HAD TO FIGHT THAT MUCH 

83
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:22,402
HARDER FOR PROGRESSIVE CHANGE. 

84
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:27,340
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE 

85
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,974
TRAJECTORY OF AMERICA HAS BEEN 

86
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:35,949
ONE OF CONGRESS. 

87
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:36,883
BUT, THAT PROGRESS DID NOT 

88
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,483
HAPPEN BY ITSELF. 

89
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,351
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY. 

90
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,087
IT WAS MADE BY  FOLKS   LIKE 

91
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:41,788
YOU.  

92
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,222
IT WASN'T MADE BY FOLKS WHO SAT 

93
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:44,524
BACK AND LET HISTORY JUST KIND 

94
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:44,924
OF HAPPEN. 

95
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,358
IT WAS MADE BY ORDINARY 

96
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:49,195
AMERICANS, WHO MARCHED, AND 

97
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,663
MOBILIZED, AND VOTED TO MAKE 

98
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:55,101
HISTORY HAPPEN. 

99
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,402
IT WAS MADE BY STUDENTS. 

100
00:03:56,402 --> 00:04:01,874
HEADING SOUTH FOR FREEDOM RISE. 

101
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,575
IT WAS MADE BY UNION WORKERS, 

102
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:06,145
DECIDING, WE ARE GOING TO 

103
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,714
COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN TO HAVE A 

104
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,217
BETTER FUTURE. 

105
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,652
IT WAS MADE BY PEOPLE WHO TOOK 

106
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,886
RISKS, AND THEY DID NOT GET 

107
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,022
THEIR NAME UP IN LIGHTS. 

108
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,123
BUT THEY KNEW THEY WERE DOING 

109
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:17,757
THE RIGHT THING. 

110
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,058
IF NOT FOR THEMSELVES, THEN AT 

111
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,394
LEAST FOR THEIR KIDS. 

112
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,862
AND, EVERY TWO STEPS FORWARD 

113
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,365
THAT WE TOOK, SOMETIMES WE ARE 

114
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,632
TAKING A STEP BACK. 

115
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:31,504
YOU KNOW, YOU WIN THE RIGHT TO 

116
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,238
CREATE A UNION. 

117
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,239
AND THEN SUDDENLY, FOLKS COME 

118
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,241
UP WITH NEW WAYS TO TRY TO BUST 

119
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:39,445
UNIONS. 

120
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,646
YOU WIN A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE, 

121
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:41,781
THEN CONGRESS DOESN'T RAISE THE 

122
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,882
MINIMUM WAGE FOR MORE THAN A 

123
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:43,483
DECADE.  

124
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,917
YOU WIN THE RIGHT TO VOTE?  

125
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:45,985
PEOPLE TRY TO TAKE IT AWAY. 

126
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,086
EVERY TIME WE HAVE GOTTEN 

127
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:54,394
CLOSER TO OUR IDEAS, A COUNTRY 

128
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,327
THAT RECOGNIZES THAT ALL PEOPLE 

129
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:58,064
ARE CREATED EQUAL, THAT WE ARE 

130
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,332
ALL ENDOWED WITH CERTAIN 

131
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:03,836
INALIENABLE RIGHTS BY OUR 

132
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:04,136
CREATOR. 

133
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:05,238
EVERY TIME WE HAVE TRIED TO 

134
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,040
MAKE THAT MANIFEST, MAKE THAT 

135
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,374
REAL, THE STATUS QUO PUSHES 

136
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,309
BACK. 

137
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:14,080
THE POWERFUL, THE PRIVILEGED. 

138
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,748
THEY FIGHT HARD TO KEEP WHAT 

139
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,351
THEY'VE GOT. 

140
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,185
AND, THEY LIKE TO TRY TO DIVIDE 

141
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:23,656
US. 

142
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,757
AND, THEY TRY TO MAKE YOU 

143
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:25,958
CYNICAL BECAUSE THAT HELPS YOU 

144
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,226
KEEP YOUR POWER AND KEEP 

145
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:27,526
PRIVILEGES. 

146
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:28,828
AND, WE ARE IN ONE OF THOSE 

147
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,398
MOMENTS RIGHT NOW. 

148
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,199
WE ALL RECOGNIZE IT. 

149
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,767
LOOK, WE DID NOT GET HERE 

150
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:38,971
OVERNIGHT. 

151
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,440
THE WORLD IS GOING THROUGH BIG 

152
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:40,706
CHANGES. 

153
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:41,307
ECONOMIC CHANGES, DEMOGRAPHIC 

154
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:45,945
CHANGES, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. 

155
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,079
IT'S CHALLENGE TO WE ARE AND 

156
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,948
WHAT WE STAND FOR AND HOW WE 

157
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:52,919
ADAPT TO THESE NEW 

158
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:53,286
CIRCUMSTANCES. 

159
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,520
AND THE FACT IS, IS THAT SOME 

160
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,357
OF THESE CHALLENGES ARE BIG, 

161
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,591
AND THEY ARE TOUGH, AND THEY 

162
00:05:58,591 --> 00:05:58,991
ARE HARD. 

163
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,660
AND WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED ALL OF 

164
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,462
THESE CHALLENGES. 

165
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,663
AND SO WHAT HAPPENSIS, PEOPLE 

166
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:03,963
GET SCARED. 

167
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,198
AND WHEN THEY GET SCARED, YOU 

168
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,834
SEE BACKLASH AGAINST PROGRESS. 

169
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,836
WHEN I WALKED IN THE OFFICE 10 

170
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,572
YEARS AGO, WE WERE IN THE 

171
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,472
MIDDLE OF THE WORST ECONOMIC 

172
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:15,308
CRISIS OF OUR LIFETIMES. 

173
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,843
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THAT THE 

174
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,377
OTHER PARTY WAS IN CHARGE OF 

175
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:18,978
THINGS. 

176
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,012
I DO THINK IT'S INTERESTING. 

177
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,649
I JUST HOPE PEOPLE KIND OF 

178
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,418
NOTICE THAT EVERY TIME THERE IS 

179
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,955
A PATTERN, WHERE THEY KIND OF 

180
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,289
-- THEY RUN THINGS INTO THE 

181
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,591
GROUND AND WE HAVE TO COME BACK 

182
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,824
AND CLEAN THINGS UP. 

183
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:41,367
BUT, NEVADA WAS HIT AS HARD AS 

184
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:41,634
ANYPLACE. 

185
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,268
EVERYBODY HERE REMEMBERS. 

186
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,002
WILL NOT EVERYBODY, BECAUSE 

187
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,338
SOME OF YOU GUYS ARE REALLY 

188
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,172
YOUNG. 

189
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,406
THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE OLDER THAN 

190
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,374
15 REMEMBER. 

191
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:51,444
SORT OF. 

192
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:55,415
BUT, BECAUSE OF THE WORK WE 

193
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,916
DID, WORKING WITH PEOPLE LIKE 

194
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:04,390
HARRY REID, WHO I LOVE, WE GOT 

195
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,124
THE ECONOMY GROWING AGAIN. 

196
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,225
WE STARTED THE LONGEST STREAK 

197
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,560
OF JOB CREATION ON RECORD. 

198
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,661
WE COVERED ANOTHER 20 MILLION 

199
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,496
PEOPLE ON HEALTH INSURANCE. 

200
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,064
WE BROUGHT HOUSING BACK HERE IN 

201
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,633
NEVADA. 

202
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:14,867
WE CUT OUR DEFICITS BY MORE 

203
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:18,371
THAN A HALF. 

204
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,305
PARTLY BY MAKING SURE THE 

205
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,306
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, FOLKS 

206
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,908
LIKE ME, PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE 

207
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:28,047
OF TAXES. 

208
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,448
SO BY THE TIME I LEFT OFFICE, 

209
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:32,418
WAGES WERE RISING. 

210
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,152
UNINSURANCE RATES WERE FALLING. 

211
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,689
POVERTY WAS FALLING. 

212
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,024
AND THAT'S WHAT I HANDED OFF TO 

213
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:44,831
THE NEXT GUY. 

214
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,132
SO WHEN YOU HEAR ALL OF THIS 

215
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,099
TALK ABOUT ECONOMIC MIRACLES 

216
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,634
RIGHT NOW, REMEMBER. 

217
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,904
WHO STARTED IT? 

218
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:56,676
REMEMBER WHO STARTED IT. 

219
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,418
COME ON! 

220
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:13,192
NOW, THAT'S IMPORTANT TO 

221
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:17,597
REMEMBER. 

222
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:24,704
NOW, WE -- NOW LISTEN, THOUGH. 

223
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,138
THE FACT IS, EVEN FOR ALL WE 

224
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:29,275
DID, WE COULDN'T REVERSE FORTY-

225
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:36,482
YEAR TRENDS IN ONLY 8 YEARS. 

226
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,349
BECAUSE PART OF WHAT HAPPENED 

227
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:38,116
IS, REPUBLICANS TOOK OVER 

228
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:38,417
CONGRESS. 

229
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,351
THEY DECIDED TO BLOCK 

230
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,585
EVERYTHING I TRIED TO DO. 

231
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:41,187
EVERYTHING. 

232
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,757
EVEN STUFF THEY USE TO SUPPORT. 

233
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:48,527
THEY DIDN'T SUPPORT IT. 

234
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:49,928
NOW SUDDENLY THEY SUPPORT IT 

235
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:55,701
AGAIN. 

236
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,903
SO, WE PULLED THE ECONOMY OUT 

237
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:57,303
OF CRISIS. 

238
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,971
BUT YOU STILL HAD PEOPLE WHO 

239
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,874
WERE STRUGGLING. 

240
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,875
YOU STILL HAVE PEOPLE WHO ONCE 

241
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,709
FELT SOLIDLY MIDDLE-CLASS, AND 

242
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,146
NOW FELT MORE INSECURE. 

243
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,614
BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY AND LOSS 

244
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:11,217
OF MANUFACTURING JOBS. 

245
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,252
AND ALL OF THAT STUFF WAS STILL 

246
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,422
GOING ON. 

247
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,556
AND THAT WAS IN THE UNITED 

248
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:17,789
STATES. 

249
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:18,758
OVERSEAS, WE TOOK OUT BIN 

250
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:18,991
LADEN. 

251
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:25,064
AND WE WOUND DOWN THE WORDS IN 

252
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,832
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN AND GOT IT 

253
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,835
TO HALT ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.  

254
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,203
BUT THERE WERE STILL A LOT OF 

255
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,338
THREATS OUT THERE AND THAT MADE 

256
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,339
PEOPLE NERVOUS. 

257
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,173
AND SO, WITH ALL THESE 

258
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,741
CHALLENGES, A LOT OF FOLKS 

259
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,445
STARTED FEELING, YOU KNOW WHAT? 

260
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,379
CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN FAST 

261
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:40,612
ENOUGH. 

262
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:41,480
AND PEOPLE FELT MAYBE NOBODY 

263
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,885
WAS LOOKING OUT FOR THEM. 

264
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,019
AND THEN THERE WAS ALL THIS 

265
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:47,820
MONEY BEING PUMPED INTO 

266
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,454
CAMPAIGNS BY THESE BIG 

267
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:54,126
BILLIONAIRE PACKS WHO WERE 

268
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,961
TRYING TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? 

269
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:58,064
THE DEMOCRATS COME UP THEY 

270
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,198
DON'T REALLY THINK LIKE YOU OR 

271
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:02,134
LOOK LIKE YOU, OR BELIEVE THE 

272
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:06,906
SAME THINGS YOU DO. 

273
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,406
AND, WE'VE SEEN THAT PLAYBOOK 

274
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:12,878
BEFORE. 

275
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,079
AND SO, PEOPLE GOT CYNICAL. 

276
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,114
AND REPUBLICANS IN POWER WANT 

277
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:15,614
YOU TO FEEL CYNICAL. 

278
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:19,585
THEY WANT YOU NOT TO VOTE. 

279
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,053
INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THE 

280
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:24,490
CHALLENGES THAT EXIST, THEY 

281
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,391
EXPLOIT SOME OF THE HISTORY 

282
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,127
THAT WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY, 

283
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,228
OF RACIAL, ETHNIC, AND 

284
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,262
RELIGIOUS DIVISIONS. 

285
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,164
AND, THEY TRY TO GET PEOPLE 

286
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,165
ANGRY. 

287
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:33,431
YOU KNOW? 

288
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:38,070
AND, THEY APPEAR -- APPEAL TO 

289
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,039
FEAR AND THEY TRY TO PIT ONE 

290
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,007
GROUP AGAINST ANOTHER. 

291
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:43,509
AND THEY TELL US THAT ORDER AND 

292
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,643
SECURITY IS GOING TO BE 

293
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:46,145
RESTORED AS LONG AS WE DON'T 

294
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:50,149
LET THOSE PEOPLE TAKE OVER, THE 

295
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,819
PEOPLE WHO DON'T LOOK LIKE US 

296
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,888
OR SOUND LIKE US OR PRAY LIKE 

297
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,791
WE DO. 

298
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,725
THEY START TALKING ABOUT REAL 

299
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,494
AMERICANS, AS IF SOME OF US 

300
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,194
AREN'T REAL AMERICANS. 

301
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,796
NO, NO, NO. 

302
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:07,433
I MEAN, IT'S AN OLD PLAYBOOK. 

303
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,667
AND YOU SEE, THE CLOSER WE GET 

304
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,503
TO ELECTION DAY, THE MORE YOU 

305
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:14,407
ARE SEEING FOLKS RESORT TO THAT.

306
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,541
NOW, IN A HEALTHY DEMOCRACY, 

307
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,477
THAT KIND OF STUFF DOESN'T WORK.

308
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,612
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS, PEOPLE 

309
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,380
OF GOODWILL IN BOTH PARTIES 

310
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,985
START CALLING OUT BIGGEST AND 

311
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,153
FEAR MONGERS AND THEY WORK TO 

312
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:27,620
COMPROMISE. 

313
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,988
THEY WORK TO GET THINGS DONE. 

314
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,356
THE PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS CAUCUS. 

315
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,360
YOU KNOW? 

316
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,127
-- STARTS KICKING IN. 

317
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,495
BUT WHEN THERE IS A VACUUM IN 

318
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:37,496
OUR DEMOCRACY, WHEN WE DON'T 

319
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,265
VOTE, WHEN WE TAKE OUR RIGHTS 

320
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:47,940
FOR GRANTED, WE TURN THE OTHER 

321
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,941
WAY TO POLITICS BECAUSE WE 

322
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,176
THINK IT'S UGLY AND MESSY AND 

323
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,377
WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. 

324
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,912
THAT'S WHEN THE VOICES FILL IN 

325
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:53,345
THE VOID. 

326
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,680
AND DEMAGOGUES START PROMISING 

327
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,518
SIMPLE FIXES TO LOOK INTO 

328
00:11:59,518 --> 00:11:59,851
PROBLEMS. 

329
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:04,623
THE PROMISE TO FIGHT FOR THE 

330
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,825
LITTLE GUY AND THEN THEY TURN 

331
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:06,659
AROUND AND ARE HELPING 

332
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:07,292
CORPORATIONS AND BILLIONAIRES 

333
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:08,394
AND THE MOST POWERFUL DO THEIR 

334
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:08,694
BIDDING. 

335
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:09,895
NO PLACE TO TAKE ON CORRUPTION, 

336
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:14,166
AND THEN THEY JUST PLUNDER AWAY.

337
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,301
AND THEY START UNDERMINING SOME 

338
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,402
OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE 

339
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,604
ESSENTIAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY. 

340
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,805
THEY MAKE IT HARDER FOR YOUNG 

341
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:20,840
PEOPLE AND MINORITIES AND THE 

342
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,340
POOR TO VOTE. 

343
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,808
AND THAT ENTRENCHES THEIR POWER 

344
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,076
FURTHER. 

345
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,344
THERE ARE STATES WHERE 

346
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,346
REPUBLICANS ARE ACTIVELY 

347
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,247
PURGING VOTER ROLLS RIGHT NOW. 

348
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,082
WHERE THEY HAVE TRIED TO SAY 

349
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:37,123
THAT STUDENTS, AND COLLEGE 

350
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:37,623
STUDENTS OPERATE UNDER 

351
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:38,657
DIFFERENT RULES THAN OTHERS AND 

352
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:39,959
MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO 

353
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:40,159
VOTE. 

354
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,964
AND, LOOK, I HAVE TO SAY THAT, 

355
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:53,071
THIS KIND OF POLITICS, IT'S NOT 

356
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:53,571
ACTUALLY CONSERVATIVE. 

357
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:54,240
IT'S A RADICAL. 

358
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,474
IT'S A VISION THAT SAYS, WE ARE 

359
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,243
GOING TO PROTECT OUR POWER NO 

360
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:03,082
MATTER WHAT. 

361
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,216
EVEN IF IT HURTS THE COUNTRY. 

362
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,417
WE ARE GOING TO DIVIDE THE 

363
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:06,285
COUNTRY AND MAKE EVERYBODY 

364
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,286
ANGRY, EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW 

365
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,387
THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO 

366
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,722
HELP CREATE JOBS OR PUT FOOD ON 

367
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,156
THE TABLE OR PAY THE RENT OR 

368
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:12,558
MAKE SURE THAT HEALTHCARE IS 

369
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:12,858
PROTECTED. 

370
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,193
IT'S A VISION WHERE THE FEW 

371
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:14,994
PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD THOSE 

372
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:15,861
HIGH-PRICED LOBBYISTS AND 

373
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:16,528
UNLIMITED CAMPAIGN 

374
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:17,830
CONTRIBUTIONS, THEY SET THE 

375
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,164
AGENDA. 

376
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,533
AND RATHER THAN BE A CHECK OR A 

377
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:23,201
BALANCE ON THIS KIND OF CORRUPT 

378
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:27,273
POLITICS, YOU'VE GOT 

379
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,073
REPUBLICANS WHO BEND OVER 

380
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,541
BACKWARDS TO SHIELD IT FROM 

381
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,410
SCRUTINY AND A BAND-AID OF 

382
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,177
CONSEQUENCES. 

383
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:37,016
JUST LIKE JACKY WAS SAYING. 

384
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:42,021
THE CURRENT SENATOR,  HE GOES 

385
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,255
ALONG WITH THIS EVEN WHEN HE 

386
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,456
GETS THE SENSE THAT IT'S NOT 

387
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:44,689
RIGHT. 

388
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:48,828
BUT IT'S OKAY. 

389
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,229
HE JUST GOES AHEAD AND GOES A 

390
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:50,429
LONG. 

391
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,664
SO, THAT'S THE MOMENT WE ARE 

392
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:51,931
IN. 

393
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:52,998
BUT, HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS 

394
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:53,231
TODAY. 

395
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:54,500
RIGHT NOW, WE'VE GOT A CHANCE 

396
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,034
TO RESTORE SOME SANITY TO OUR 

397
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:57,269
POLITICS. 

398
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,071
RIGHT NOW, WE CAN TIP THE 

399
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,873
BALANCE OF POWER. 

400
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,207
BACK TO YOU, THE AMERICAN 

401
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:07,980
PEOPLE. 

402
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,981
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY, THERE IS 

403
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,549
ONLY ONE REAL CHECK ON ABUSES 

404
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,785
OF POWER. 

405
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,220
THERE IS ONLY ONE CHECK ON BAD 

406
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,453
POLICY. 

407
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,188
AND THAT IS YOU AND YOUR VOTE. 

408
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:22,962
YOU. 

409
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,630
AND, YOU KNOW, THE GREAT THING, 

410
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,665
IN NEVADA, YOU DON'T HAVE TO 

411
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,033
WAIT TWO WEEKS. 

412
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:33,472
YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND VOTE RIGHT 

413
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,941
NOW. 

414
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:42,081
IN NEVADA, EARLY VOTING IS 

415
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:42,481
ALREADY UNDERWAY. 

416
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,616
YOU CAN VOTE AT ANY EARLY 

417
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,650
VOTING SITE IN YOUR COMMUNITY. 

418
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,751
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT 

419
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:51,090
IS, JUST GO TO VOTENVDEMS.COM.  

420
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:56,161
FIND OUT WHERE YOU CAN VOTE. 

421
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,796
SO, THERE IS NO REASON TO 

422
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:58,296
OVERCOMPLICATE STUFF. 

423
00:14:58,296 --> 00:15:02,134
SOMETIMES I THINK DEMOCRATS DO. 

424
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,635
JUST, LIKE, THEY'RE ANALYZING 

425
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:04,069
STUFF. 

426
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,506
JUST VOTE! 

427
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,174
AND, IF YOU DON'T THINK IT'S 

428
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:13,178
IMPORTANT TO VOTE, LOOK AT WHAT 

429
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:14,213
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE THESE 

430
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,448
PAST 2 YEARS. 

431
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,649
LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE SAYING 

432
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:19,251
THEY ARE GOING TO DO IF YOU 

433
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,589
SEND THEM BACK TO DO MORE. 

434
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,890
HERE IS JUST ONE SIMPLE FACT. 

435
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,624
THIS IS A FACT. 

436
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:31,697
THIS IS NOT -- UNLIKE SOME, I 

437
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:32,831
ACTUALLY TRY TO STATE FACTS. 

438
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,099
I BELIEVE IN FACT. 

439
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:41,807
ALL RIGHT? 

440
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,175
I BELIEVE IN A FACT-BASED 

441
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:43,642
REALITY. 

442
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:51,784
AND, A FACT-BASED POLITICS. 

443
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,585
I DON'T BELIEVE IN JUST MAKING 

444
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:57,489
STUFF UP. 

445
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,524
I BELIEVE IN ACTUALLY JUST 

446
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,625
SAYING TO PEOPLE WHAT'S TRUE. 

447
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:06,432
SO, HERE'S WHAT'S TRUE. 

448
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,333
THEY HAND IT OUT. 

449
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,102
$1.5 TRILLION IN TAX CUTS. 

450
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,503
AND COMING TO BILLIONAIRES AND 

451
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:14,173
CORPORATIONS. 

452
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,741
YOU KNOW WHAT? 

453
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:23,549
IT WAS NOT DONE FOR YOU. 

454
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:23,916
$1.5 TRILLION. 

455
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,717
THEY DIDN'T EVEN PRETEND TO PAY 

456
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:26,718
FOR. 

457
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:29,188
DEFICITS SHOT UP. 

458
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,423
WHEN I WAS PRESIDENT, AND I WAS 

459
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:35,127
TRYING TO FUND EARLY CHILDHOOD 

460
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,563
EDUCATION, OR TRYING TO FUND 

461
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:41,967
INFRASTRUCTURE, THEY WOULD SAY, 

462
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:42,267
NO, NO. 

463
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,604
WE CAN'T DO THAT. 

464
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:46,438
DEFICITS ARE TOO HIGH. 

465
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,440
IT'S AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS. 

466
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,108
THEN SUDDENLY, WHEN IT COMES TO 

467
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:57,816
GIVING 1,000,000,000,000 1/2 

468
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,118
DOLLARS, FOR FOLKS WHO ARE 

469
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:02,588
ALREADY SITTING PRETTY,DON'T 

470
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:03,522
NEED IT, WEREN'T EVEN ASKING 

471
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,691
FOR IT, SUDDENLY   DEFICITS ARE 

472
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:10,229
NO PROBLEM. 

473
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,829
DON'T EVEN TRY TO PAY FOR IT. 

474
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,964
DON'T PRETEND TO PAY FOR IT. 

475
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:18,804
EXCEPT JUST LAST WEEK. 

476
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:19,738
THE LEADER OF THE REPUBLICANS 

477
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:20,439
IN CONGRESS -- 

478
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,673

WAS IN NEVADA.

00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:40,492
LOTS OF FEVERISH CAMPAIGNING

THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION FOR 

496
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:46,598
MANY THINGS, INCLUDING FEAR 

497
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,033
MONGERING AND PITTING GROUPS
