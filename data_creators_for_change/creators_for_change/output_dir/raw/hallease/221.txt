5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,639

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">worried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm scared at first but as I was</font>

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">watching I could feel my hair getting</font>

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,050
cleaner but not losing everything um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,980
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little worried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the baking</font>

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,270
soda would dry out because I'd read a

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,850
lot of people's blogs and then like

14
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,930
websites and stuff and they said like

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,329
it's great it does its job sometimes I

16
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:40,530
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure here a little dry though and</font>

17
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,879
so what people said was that they put a

18
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,820
little brown<font color="#E5E5E5"> sugar in it and so I did</font>

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,530
that and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what I'm feeling</font>

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,390
as far as the softness goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the brown</font>

21
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,770
sugar working its magic cuz yeah here it

22
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,160
feels clean but not strips it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,670
great and it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a little more like</font>
