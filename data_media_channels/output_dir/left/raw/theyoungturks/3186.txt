1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,100
>>DID YOU HEAR THEY SOLD TIME
INC.? TIME INC. WHICH PUBLISHES

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,260
TIME MAGAZINE, THIS IS AN
INTERESTING ADDENDUM ABOUT THE

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,470
FUTURE OF THE MAGAZINE.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,370
WHEN TIME WARNER SPUN IT OFF
FROM THE ORIGINAL TIME WARNER

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,990
ENTITY IT BECAME ITS OWN
PUBLISHING UNIT.

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,350
THEY DECIDED THEY WERE GOING
TO TRY TO MAKE THIS WHOLE

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,350
THING WORK.

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:30,140
IT DIDN'T PAN OUT AND THEY WERE
SOLD TO MEREDITH PUBLISHING.

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,640
THEY OWN BETTER HOMES & GARDENS
AND THERE IS ONE THING ABOUT

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,360
THAT PURCHASE THAT IS
INTERESTING AND INVOLVES A

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,470
FAMILIAR NAME.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:47,220
IT IS THAT THE KOCH
INDUSTRIES PONIED UP 600

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,690
MONEY TO BUY TIME INC.

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,770
WHAT DOES THAT BRING
WITH IT?

15
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,770
NO ONE REALLY KNOWS.

16
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,989
THERE WILL BE NO BOARD OF
DIRECTORS FOR THIS NEW

17
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,120
ENTITY OF KOCH INDUSTRIES.

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,729
BUT SOME HAVE SPECULATED THAT
THEY COULD NONETHELESS USE

19
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:07,049
THE MEDIA PROPERTIES WHICH
REACH MILLIONS OF ONLINE AND

20
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:26,740
PRINT READERS TO PROMOTE THEIR
BRAND OF CONSERVATISM.

21
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,189
>> MEREDITH HAS BEEN TRYING TO
BUY TIME INC.

22
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:31,840
FOR SOME TIME NOW.

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,899
THEY RECENTLY TRIED TO BUY A BUT
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH CAPITAL.

24
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:39,169
THEN THE KOCH BROTHERS CAME IN
AND GAVE THEM THE EXTRA 650

25
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:42,779
MILLION WHICH WAS CONVENIENT AND
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY DO

26
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:45,210
HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY TIME INC.

27
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,659
DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS, I
DON'T KNOW THE POLITICS OF

28
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:53,539
MEREDITH IS.

29
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:57,079
SOME PEOPLE ARE MAKING
ASSUMPTIONS SAYING THEY ARE FROM

30
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:03,349
DES MOINES AND THEY HAVE THINGS
LIKE FAMILY CIRCLE IN THE

31
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:06,099
HOME AND GARDENS ñ I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ANY OF THAT MEANS.

32
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:08,709
SO WHAT?

33
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:11,180
I GUESS THEY ARE TRYING TO IMPLY
THAT MUST MEAN THAT THEY

34
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,910
ARE CONSERVATIVE BUT I DON'T
KNOW WHY LIBERALS WOULD

35
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,370
WANT TO HAVE BETTER HOMES OR
BETTER GARDENS?

36
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,930
>> PERSONALLY I WOULD LIKE A
BETTER HOME.

37
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,810
>> BUT THE KOCH BROTHERS MIGHT
KNOW SOMETHING WE DON'T.

38
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,990
MAYBE MEREDITH IS CONSERVATIVE
AND WE JUST DON'T KNOW?

39
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,990
SOME

40
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,230
MEDIA WE DO KNOW.

41
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,469
SINCLAIR BROADCASTING, TOTALLY
CONSERVATIVE AND DECEPTIVELY SO.

42
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:53,390
THEY ARE DOING THE OLD TRICK FOX
NEWS USED TO DO, FAIR AND

43
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,390
BALANCED.

44
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,719
THEY WILL PUT IN A HATCHET JOB
OPINION PIECE LITTERED WITH

45
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,680
WRONG INFORMATION INTO A LOCAL
NEWS BROADCAST.

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:16,750
AND YOU'RE LIKE 
WAIT A MINUTE

47
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,780
IT'S NOT GOOD.

48
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,780
IS DECEPTIVE.

49
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,700
IF IT WAS SINCLAIR BROADCASTING
BUYING TIME INC.

50
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,549
AND THE KOCH BROTHERS GIVE THE
MONEY, THE WHOLE POINT IS

51
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:31,939
PROPAGANDA.

52
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:33,599
IT MIGHT TURN OUT THE KOCH
BROTHERS THINK IT IS A GOOD

53
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,670
INVESTMENT AND THEY MIGHT MAKE
MONEY.

54
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:43,389
I GUESS TIME 
WILL TELL.

55
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,519
>>AT THE VERY LEAST IT WILL BE
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW OR

56
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,510
IF TIME MAGAZINE CHANGES ITS
COVERS IN THE FUTURE.

57
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:55,400
MEREDITH DOES OWN LOCAL NEWS
STATIONS BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN

58
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,030
THE SAME KIND OF WRITEUPS.

59
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,629
>>THERE IS ONE LAST POSSIBILITY.

60
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,209
THAT MEREDITH ñ

61
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:21,690
I DON'T MEREDITH IS LYING ABOUT
THEIR BOARD COMPOSITION.

62
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,860
SO THE KOCH BROTHERS DON'T
NECESSARILY HAVE TO SAY HEY

63
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,860
MR.

64
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:34,560
MEREDITH, GO DO A HATCHET
JOB ON THE LIVES.

65
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,400
IF THEY KNOW THAT THE GUYS
RUNNING MEREDITH ARE

66
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,860
CONSERVATIVE THEY THINK WELL
MAYBE IT IS A GOOD

67
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:51,740
INVESTMENT, MAYBE IT IS NOT.

68
00:04:51,740 --> 00:05:05,889
>>ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO OWN TIME
MAGAZINE IS KIND OF A FANTASY.

69
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:10,270
>> NOW HAVING SAID ALL THAT I
DON'T MIND THAT MUCH BECAUSE I

70
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,240
THINK THEY ARE LARGELY MIXING
THEIR MONEY.

71
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,770
THEY ARE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF
MEDIA.

72
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:25,480
THAT GETS ME TO THE HISTORY OF
TIME MAGAZINE.

73
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,950
FOR A LONG TIME TIME MAGAZINE
WAS NONPARTISAN AND DID

74
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,569
GOOD WORK.

75
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:34,200
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP ETC.

76
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:47,970
IF YOU LOOK INTO THE HISTORY OF
TIME, LOOSE, ONE OF THE OWNERS

77
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:56,699
HELPED CIA SO THAT THE CIA COULD
ORGANIZE COUPS AND SERVE

78
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,590
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS
INSTEAD.

79
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:09,449
TIME MAGAZINE AIDED AND ABETTED
THAT TIME 

80
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:44,900
AND TIME AGAIN.

81
00:06:44,900 --> 00:07:08,000
>> AND THEN WE 

82
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,050
WILL GET TO ENJOY
SEEING THE DEMISE OF THEIR

83
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,050
MONEY QUICKER.

84
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:18,210
>>IT'S JUST INTERESTING TO SEE
THE COINCIDING OF AGING TYPES OF

85
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,039
MEDIA LIKE PRINTS, WEEKLY
MAGAZINES, AND LOCAL NEWS

86
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,470
CHANNELS AND THE DEMOGRAPHIC
THEY APPEALED TO.

87
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,720
AND VOTER IDEOLOGY.

88
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,900
IT SEEMS LIKE THE YOUNGER FOLKS
ALWAYS SEEM TO BE SLANTING MORE

89
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,400
PROGRESSIVE AND DON'T USE THAT
MEDIA AT ALL.

90
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,259
BUT AS YOU SEE MORE KOCH
AFFILIATED, SINCLAIR, THOSE

91
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:45,960
FOLKS ARE BUYING UP THOSE AGING
PIECES OF MEDIA THAT WILL STILL

92
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:53,310
BE PROVIDING NEWS TO PEOPLE FOR
AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME,

93
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,080
IT IS JUST FASCINATING TO ME
THAT THEY ARE LIKE WELL, IT

94
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,210
IS STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT
TODAY.

95
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,710
AT THE END MAYBE WE WILL SHORTED
IT, AND GET RID OF IT AND

96
00:07:59,710 --> 00:00:00,000
DUMP IT BEFORE IT GOES UNDER.
