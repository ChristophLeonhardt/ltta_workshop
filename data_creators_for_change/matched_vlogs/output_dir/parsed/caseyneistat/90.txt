my friend right there dude I'm broken
welcome to three six eight I'm gonna go
get some breakfast
okay the car give me a coffee
today's a travel day today is uh three
six eight on the road I I had an idea
it's like a it's like a skateboard
suitcase
okay all right
where's the clock II just got a sandwich
hey dude we're going to LaGuardia
Airport
all right now we're back at the hey wait
it's the first time 3/16 been to the
airport now we're at the airport very
skateboards pulling out 1 to 10 what are
your odds of getting in trouble because
you don't have an American passport do
you probably 9 out of 10 10 out of 10 I
can't believe you put me take it without
even jegging if i need visa
okay honey dead dog see eggs okay so
yeah he needs a visa and our flights in
ten minutes
thank you dude this is three six eight I
mean just wing it
occupation what I said
please to Kate spod hey spod he's
checking the status of his visa
application now but some flight board in
like 15 minutes it's approved come on
yes then they approve yeah do you think
they'll let me through with this
suitcase both depending on what's inside
well it's got a motor on it
you know what around Christmas time last
year we weren't allowing these I think
okay it actually we made it through
security with the backpack
nothing happens where it like just stops
rolling
I know the camera broke yeah you're so
pretty hard so this is what happened to
my camera when I fell no image comes
through on the screen it's on right now
and there's no image
not ready to give a conclusive review
about the motorized backpack but so far
and mixed experience I'll treat today
the Canadian dream as far away as it
ever be
you later thank you
what are you a taxi
all right we are in Montreal in Canada
I'm here for a work commitment like a
speaking engagement that I had scheduled
a long time ago but because Dan's in
town I was like hey come to Canada but
there's literally like 20 minutes of
free time throughout the entire day in
between my work commitment and then us
being on the first flight back to New
York City we'll just have to make the
most of it right yeah it's do
okay this is about it I have like 25
minutes for I need to be at the event
center but this is like the work part of
this trip lunch first
is so cold in here the reason but first
nachos
like a millimeter from hitting is that
good yeah oh you gonna do a video all
right this is very uncomfortable I'm
gonna go do I talk now dancing asleep
here or on the nearest couch that he can
find I'm gonna leave the camera here
you guys like those nachos how do fake
like you are nice and caring okay
finished my talk it went really well
this is the room that I was in before
the talk Dan stayed in here during the
talk dan how ridiculous this Bellinis I
thought you were sleeping under a table
I have no idea why casein flew me here
with it I'm almost done have you been
holding down the fort you know I did
have a space flight leaves in three
hours and 27 minutes
get to that I'm super Cheers with
obvious people case he's hanging out
with
spending my time with me bye guys thank
you see you all right do you see it it's
there I'm done fiddly it's right the
rage rocket there is right there
the conclusion on the comprehensive
review ah well the concept the concept I
give an A+ to ran out of the bag a plus
I want this in every Airport I go to the
execution well it sort of feels like a
rough draft they have a little bit of
ways to go before this becomes like a
practical and safe means of getting
around Airport but overall I think it's
a pretty great little idea all right so
that's kind of probably it for the
episode today we're both pretty beat up
you want to end it with like that see
what I'm dealing with
downtown please oh and we're home I'm a
traveling
on tomorrow's episode of three six eight
