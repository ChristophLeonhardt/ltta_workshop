00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,420
My name is Sam Levinson, and
I am the writer and director

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,730
of “Assassination Nation."

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,030
So this is a scene later in
the film in which the four

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,930
girls are accused of being
behind the massive data

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,079
hack that resulted in all
of the residents of Salem’s

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,210
private information
being leaked.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,250
They’re getting
death threats online.

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,800
They’re posting their address.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,330
And Em, who’s
played by Abra here,

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,810
is worried that her mother
forgot to set the alarm.

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,210
Initially, it was
written as a house fire,

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,320
actually, in the script.

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,405
And because we’re
a low budget film,

14
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:35,340
we — we couldn’t
afford a house fire.

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,250
So Marcell Rev, the
cinematographer and myself

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,130
sat in a room with a kind
of a 3D model of this house

17
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,930
that we had found that was
in Louisiana that kind of was

18
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,470
on a corner, so we could
basically — it had,

19
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,227
you know, three sides that
we — we could all see.

20
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:53,435
The goal was to create a
scene that felt as cinematic

21
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:56,040
as — as a house
fire but with —

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,600
but something that
we can shoot in —

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,400
in 10 hours.

24
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,377
So we sat there
with, basically,

25
00:01:00,377 --> 00:01:02,460
this 3D model that Michael
Grasley, our production

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,620
designer, had built,
and tried to figure out,

27
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,320
what’s the scariest
way possible

28
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,715
that we could
sort of, you know,

29
00:01:08,715 --> 00:01:11,280
choreograph this home
invasion sequence?

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,370
And we came up with
this idea of shooting it

31
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,310
from the outside.

32
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,690
And actually, on — on this
take here when the stunt

33
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,010
guy grabs Abra and pulls
her towards the window,

34
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,830
he actually slams his
hand into the glass,

35
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,570
and the glass
actually shattered

36
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,600
for real, which was a moment
where your kind of heart

37
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,620
drops as a filmmaker, and
you hope everyone’s O.K.

38
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,850
But that ended up having
to be our last take

39
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,160
for that section right
there, because we

40
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,900
couldn’t replace the window.

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,170
So we had kind of
designed this dolly track

42
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,162
that a techno crane
with a 42-foot arm

43
00:01:45,162 --> 00:01:46,870
could sit on so it
can actually go around

44
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,460
all three sides of the
house without a single cut.

45
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,170
And so from that
point on, it was just

46
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,570
a matter of — of getting the
choreography and the timing

47
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,070
right.

48
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,900
So, you know, I would sit
with Marcell behind the crane

49
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,420
and — and sort of walk
with him with a radio

50
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,604
that I could communicate with
all the actors inside to make

51
00:02:03,604 --> 00:02:05,145
sure that they — 
they hit their marks

52
00:02:05,145 --> 00:02:06,894
or to make sure that
they were — you know,

53
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,610
the camera was
keeping up with them,

54
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,276
or they were keeping
up with the camera,

55
00:02:10,276 --> 00:02:12,990
so it felt like this was
something that was in motion

56
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,220
and was continuing to sort
of, you know, build suspense.

57
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,440
There was also something
that felt, you know,

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,580
very apropos about watching
this horror unfold and —

59
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,415
and being helpless to
it, which is, I think,

60
00:02:26,415 --> 00:02:28,790
something that we often feel
and trolling through Twitter

61
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,650
or — or Instagram
and — and looking

62
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,140
at these sort of
tragedies unfold,

63
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,600
where we’ve become sort
of spectators to it.

64
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,400
