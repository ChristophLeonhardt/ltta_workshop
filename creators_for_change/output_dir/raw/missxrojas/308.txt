hi everyone happy new year<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spent the</font>

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:03,419
last week of last year and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:04,980
week of this one re reading old

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">favorites because when I find myself in</font>

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,910
times of trouble literature comes to me

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,370
speaking words of wisdom read<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,410
revisited alabaster boarding school we

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,820
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case files of the little girls</font>

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">and even did a bit of the Heathcliff</font>

10
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,199
Heathcliff I also<font color="#E5E5E5"> reread a spot of</font>

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,869
nonfiction including Andrew Smith's<font color="#CCCCCC"> moon</font>

12
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">dust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> andrew smith in moon dust</font>

14
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,720
surviving moon walkers and then there

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,429
were eight and find out about their

16
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,260
lives upon their return to<font color="#CCCCCC"> earth the</font>

17
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,640
thing I love about rereading when I

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,840
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chance to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,670
so much anymore is concentrating on

20
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,989
other aspects of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

21
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,250
didn't notice on the first go around

22
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,710
it's as true for<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonfiction as it is for</font>

23
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,450
fiction rereading moon does that can

24
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,980
help but notice the power that can be

25
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,020
done and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the damage that can be done by</font>

26
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,520
language and how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a book</font>

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,350
about language and about rhetoric

28
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,050
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phrase the space race</font>

29
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,850
Jeff his goal and the language

32
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,780
limited and what they are over they are

passed throughout the book<font color="#E5E5E5"> Smith</font>

34
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,290
observes how people repeatedly choose

35
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,970
fictional representations of space

36
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,400
exploration over its reality something

37
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,740
that as a fan of sci-fi I<font color="#CCCCCC"> realize makes</font>

38
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,240
me a little bit frustrated with myself

39
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,130
because if I do exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same but</font>

42
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,860
this sense dates back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Old North in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the 1300 race was used to mean the</font>

46
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,049
the sense of a contest or competition

47
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,360
for 200 years a race didn't mean having

48
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,340
a winner or even in ending it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

49
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,439
instead an active natural process of

50
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,119
course space race is a phrase that was

51
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">created to perform a specific function</font>

52
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,020
it forms a function in the sense of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

53
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">political and also in raising public</font>

54
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,950
excitement about this thing this thing

55
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,079
being space exploration as a whole but

56
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,270
whittled down to one thing walking on

57
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,009
the moon before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other guys do we</font>

58
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,240
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things in terms of races</font>

59
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,649
because it's easier and because it

60
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:54,210
focuses us it's also appearing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

61
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,829
opinion because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it allows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us to get away</font>

62
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">with not sustaining our interest or</font>

63
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,860
sustaining the discussions surrounding

64
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,649
the supposed prize of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> space race or</font>

65
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,479
of anyways so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll focus should</font>

66
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,939
shift from small limited races and we

67
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,500
should discuss not how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to win the race</font>

68
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">but why something deserves our sustained</font>

69
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,810
interest

70
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,610
corollary to that our resources because

71
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,959
these sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to require</font>

72
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,090
money and time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and energy and attention</font>

73
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,170
so a question to begin 2013 2k13 the

74
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,290
year 13 or two questions in fact what in

75
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,910
your opinion deserves are sustained

76
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,989
interest and what has been

77
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:28,150
mischaracterized as a race it can be

78
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,760
something personal it could be something

79
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,319
international whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

80
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a lovely weekend and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see you</font>

81
