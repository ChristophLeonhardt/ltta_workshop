I rallied the crowds in Milan but Matteo salvini wanted the ear of the whole nation only days away from Italy's parliamentary elections this was the largest gathering given by the right-wing populist La Liga party it may have started out as a northern Italian secessionist movement with a desire to separate from what it called a backward southern region but this is Italy politics here is a mercurial game sensing the change it rebranded itself as the party for all Italians with the same anti-immigrant populist program we want a federal modern efficient country which takes care of the north and the south employment taxation immigration the liga has grown up in many ways leaders anti-union eurozone he's also against the big banks and their dominance over the economy anti-immigration policies in the last four years some 600,000 people have arrived in Italy by sea but it has coincided with a tough recession and high unemployment and the infrastructure has barely been able to cope the anti-immigration rhetoric has served to whip up sentiments here in Vilnius the government has imposed its uncontrolled migration on us it's unregulated and it's not fair to clean Italy I want more employment less crime we have all these illegal immigrants who are destroying Italy all over the country there is a sense of hardening attitudes in the southern city of Palermo one neo-fascist group came out to defend its positions meanwhile in the capital Rome the fear of a return of Italy's fascist past prompted five separate demonstrations railing against the agenda of the far-right this is a country which has always had sharp divisions in the police scene but there is a fear that violent tensions of the past are making a return the sluggish economy has made many hair feel hard done by and there is little trust in mainstream politicians to resolve it Sonia Gallagher al-jazeera Milan
