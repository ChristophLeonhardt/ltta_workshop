00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,293
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" FOR THIS

3
00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:10,961
PIECE YESTERDAY AT THE HEIGHT

4
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:13,297
OF DEADLY CLASHES ON THE GAZA

5
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:15,165
BORDER WITH ISRAEL.

6
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:17,501
THE HEADLINE READING ISRAEL

7
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:19,603
KILLS 58 AND INJURES OVER 1300

8
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:20,771
BY GUNFIRE AT GAZA BORDER.

9
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,607
THE ARTICLE FAILED TO MENTION

10
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,909
THE HAMAS MILITANTS' DISGUISED

11
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:27,311
AS PROTESTORS WHO ISRAEL BLAMES

12
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:30,414
FOR FIRING UP TENSIONS UNTIL

13
00:00:30,414 --> 00:00:32,281
THE 42nd PARAGRAPH OF ITS MAIN

14
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:33,217
STORY LAST NIGHT.

15
00:00:33,217 --> 00:00:35,586
HOWIE KURTZ IS A FOX NEWS MEDIA

16
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:36,653
ANALYST AND HAS SOME THOUGHTS

17
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:38,389
ON THAT THIS MORNING.

18
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:39,757
HOWIE.

19
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:41,392
>> THIS IS THE PROBLEM FOR

20
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:42,793
JOURNALISM THAT GOES BEYOND

21
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:43,861
"THE NEW YORK TIMES." YES, WE

22
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,629
CAN DEBATE THE LEVEL OF THE

23
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:46,563
ISRAELI RESPONSE.

24
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:48,065
YES, WE CAN DEBATE THE ROLE OF

25
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:49,600
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DECISION TO

26
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,567
MOVE THE EMBASSY.

27
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:53,570
BUT THIS WAS A CONFRONTATION

28
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,072
THAT WAS ORCHESTRATED BY HAMAS

29
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:57,307
KNOWING FULL WELL THERE WOULD

30
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,243
BE CASUALTIES FOR PROPAGANDA

31
00:00:59,243 --> 00:00:59,610
PURPOSES.

32
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,178
HERE IS WHAT IS LEFT OUT OR

33
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:03,213
MINIMIZED IN THE COVERAGE.

34
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:04,415
FOR EXAMPLE, HAMAS SENT SOME

35
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:05,816
WOMEN TOWARD THE FENCE KNOWING

36
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:10,020
THEY WOULD MAKE MORE

37
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,655
SYMPATHETIC VICTIMS.

38
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,856
THE SUPPOSEDLY UNARMED

39
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:14,491
PROTESTORS SOME HAD EXPLOSIVES

40
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,261
TO ATTACK THE ISRAELI SIDE AND

41
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:18,562
ISRAEL THAT DROPPED LEAFLETS IN

42
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:19,496
THE AREA WARNING THE

43
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,165
PALESTINIANS TO STAY AWAY FROM

44
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:21,632
THE FENCE.

45
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:23,033
HAMAS WANTED THIS CONFRONTATION.

46
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:25,335
>> Sandra: THEN THERE IS THIS.

47
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,204
THE COVER OF THE DAILY NEWS

48
00:01:27,204 --> 00:01:31,408
HERE IN NEW YORK WITH A SMILING

49
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:35,813
IVANKA TRUMP ON THE COVER

50
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:40,517
TITLED DADDY'S LITTLE GHOUL.

51
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,152
IVANKA ALL SMILES AT UNVEIL.

52
00:01:42,152 --> 00:01:45,756
>> I FIND THE COVER TO BE

53
00:01:45,756 --> 00:01:46,223
PATHETIC.

54
00:01:46,223 --> 00:01:52,863
WE KNOW THE DAILY NEWS, TO

55
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,699
SINGLE THEM OUT.

56
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,835
OTHERS QUESTIONED WHY WERE THEY

57
00:01:57,835 --> 00:01:58,135
THERE?

58
00:01:58,135 --> 00:01:58,902
THEY'RE THE HIGHEST RANKING

59
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:00,270
JEWISH AMERICANS IN THE WHITE

60
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,571
HOUSE.

61
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,039
OF COURSE THEY WOULD BE THERE

62
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,908
AND EMPHASIZING WHAT THEY SEE

63
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:05,676
AS THE ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY

64
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:07,478
WHICH BY THE WAY MANY PREVIOUS

65
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:08,412
PRESIDENTS HAVE TALKED ABOUT

66
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:10,214
BUT NOT ACTUALLY DONE IN MOVING

67
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:11,248
THE EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM.

68
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:13,817
BUT THE OTHER THING HERE IS THE

69
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:14,751
SPLIT SCREEN COVERAGE.

70
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:17,588
THE PICTURES, REGARDLESS OF THE

71
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:18,422
HEADLINES HAMAS GETS THE

72
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:19,723
CELEBRATION AT THE DEDICATION

73
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,825
OF THE EMBASSY AND ALL THE

74
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:24,161
VIOLENCE AT THE PROTESTS WHICH

75
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:25,095
AGAIN HAMAS CLEARLY

76
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:26,730
PRECIPITATED AND THAT MAKES THE

77
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,132
ISRAELI SIDE LOOK BAD BECAUSE

78
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:32,703
WHEN YOU GLANCE AT IT, YOU

79
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:33,904
DON'T REALIZE IT'S INCUMBENT ON

80
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,806
JOURNALISTS TO POINT THIS OUT.

81
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:37,674
IT WAS A CONFRONTATION THAT

82
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:39,309
HAMAS WANTED.

83
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:40,244
WANTS THE VIOLENCE.

84
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,678
IT WANTS CASUALTIES BECAUSE

85
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:45,082
THAT HELPS IT PAINT ISRAEL AS

86
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,918
SOME KIND OF A MILITARY THUGISH

87
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:48,385
NATION.

88
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:50,721
>> Sandra: WE HEARD FROM NIKKI

89
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:51,922
HALEY TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY'S

90
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,991
OPENING OF THE EMBASSY IN

91
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:55,626
JERUSALEM SAYING IT WAS A CAUSE

92
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:56,827
FOR CELEBRATION FOR THE

93
00:02:56,827 --> 00:02:57,327
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

94
00:02:57,327 --> 00:02:59,163
SHE SAID MOVING THE U.S.

95
00:02:59,163 --> 00:02:59,963
EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM WAS THE

96
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:01,165
RIGHT THING TO DO.

97
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:03,367
IT REFLECTS THE WILL OF THE

98
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:03,867
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

99
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:05,702
LISTEN TO HER HERE.

100
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:07,571
>> THOSE WHO SUGGEST THE GAZA

101
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:08,772
VIOLENCE HAS ANYTHING TO DO

102
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,575
WITH THE LOCATION OF THE

103
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:13,610
AMERICAN EMBASSY ARE SORELY

104
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:13,977
MISTAKEN.

105
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:15,879
RATHER, THE VIOLENCE COMES FROM

106
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,548
THOSE WHO REJECT THE EXISTENCE

107
00:03:17,548 --> 00:03:21,818
OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL IN ANY

108
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:22,252
LOCATION.

109
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:25,289
SUCH A MOTIVATION, THE

110
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,957
DESTRUCTION OF A UNITED NATIONS

111
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,825
MEMBER STATE IS SO ILLEGITIMATE

112
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:31,628
AS TO NOT BE WORTH OUR TIME IN

113
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,196
THE SECURITY COUNCIL.

114
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:34,031
OTHER THAN THE TIME IT TAKES TO

115
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:34,932
DENOUNCE IT.

116
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:36,099
>> Sandra: WANT TO GET YOUR

117
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:37,968
FINE AT THOUGHTS THERE AS WE

118
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,136
HEARD FROM AMBASSADOR NIKKI

119
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,603
HALEY.

120
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:41,004
>> I CAN'T QUITE AGREE THE

121
00:03:41,004 --> 00:03:41,939
DECISION TO MOVE THE EMBASSY

122
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:46,577
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

123
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:47,044
VIOLENCE.

124
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:49,880
IT DID INFURIATE THE

125
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,814
PALESTINIAN SIDE.

126
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,916
AT THE SAME TIME THE PROPER

127
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:58,589
RESPONSE IS NOT TO SEND

128
00:03:58,589 --> 00:04:01,391
PROTESTORS TO A BORDER AREA

129
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:02,559
WITH EXPLOSIVES AND INCENDIARY

130
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:02,859
KITES.

131
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:05,829
THERE IS A DANGER FOR WESTERN

132
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,965
JOURNALISTS TO SIMPLY SAY WELL,

133
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:09,132
ISRAEL SHOT ALL THESE PEOPLE

134
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:10,367
WHEN CLEARLY THAT WAS THE

135
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:11,935
RESPONSE THAT HAMAS WANTED.

136
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:14,371
BY THE WAY, ISRAEL VOLUNTARILY

137
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:16,173
PULLED OUT OF GAZA 13 YEARS AGO.

138
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,541
TURNED IT OVER TO HAMAS TO RUN.

139
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,410
IT WOULDN'T BE AN OCCUPYING

140
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,045
MILITARY POWER AND THIS IS THE

141
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:22,913
KIND OF THING HAMAS CONTINUES

142
00:04:22,913 --> 00:04:24,147
TO DO.

143
00:04:24,147 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Sandra: SHE CONCLUDED BY
