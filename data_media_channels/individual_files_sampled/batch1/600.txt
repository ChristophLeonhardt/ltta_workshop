it's an overwhelming drought these cattle swarm around a water truck in New South Wales looking for relief from the devastating join us the ground has become too bare for grass to grow and the weather too extreme to predict farmers in eastern Australia say the drought has taken over turning ones fertile lands into dust bowls to keep cattle alive some farmers have been forced to ship in hay and grain from other parts of the country that is expensive the national government is pledging nearly 150 million additional dollars to help offset the cost this winter has been particularly cruel you have to go back to 1965 to see another winter like this one and you've got to remember that some of our farmers haven't really recovered from the last rap some farms are doing better than others but stories of desperation are repeated across New South Wales nearly 80,000 people in the state depend on the agriculture industry contributing more than 10 billion dollars to its annual economy but the drought is affecting more than farming the government says it's concerned about farmers mental health and the isolation of those who live in remote areas I find droughts a little bit like cancer it sort of eats away at you it just gets drier and drier and more severe and more severe and impacting on your life of course a dry spell with no signs of ending with entire farming communities welcoming support from local leaders but hoping for help from Mother Nature Katia Lopes Audrey on al-jazeera
