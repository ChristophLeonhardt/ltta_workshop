00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:40,455
THE IDEAL ITSELF SOMETHING THAT

38
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:41,223

00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:42,424
TRUMP IDIOTS.

00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:53,635
PRESIDENT WAS ATTACKED FOR

43
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:54,403
CRITICIZING TERESA MAYS BREXIT

00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:31,506
IT OBAMA'S ATTITUDE CRIMEA WAS

56
00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:49,758
IF THERE IS SOMEBODY IN THE

57
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,692
SOUND CLAIM THAT WE WOULD

58
00:02:50,693 --> 00:02:51,393
CONSIDER GOING FORWARD RUSSIA

59
00:02:51,394 --> 00:02:52,394
OVER CRIMEA AND EASTERN UKRAINE

MUCH TOUGHER ON FIVE-YEAR PLAN

68
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:31,333
THAT OBAMA EVER WAS, NOT JUST

69
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:32,367
WITH SANCTIONS BUT HITTING THEM

70
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:33,235
WHERE IT HURTS, ENERGY POLICY.

71
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:34,369
THAT, THE BIGGEST EVER STATUS ON

72
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,303
GOVERNMENT HACKING IN AMERICA IS

73
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:35,904
BEING DONE BY CHINA.
