GREG: SHOULD WE CREDIT HIM FOR CHANGING KIM. DENNIS RODMAN SAYS HE DESERVE AS PAT ON THE BACK IN THE NORTH KOREAN SUMMIT HAPPENS. HE WAS MAKING NICE WITH KIM JONG-UN LONG BEFORE HE THOUGHT A SUMMIT WAS POSSIBLE. HE BROUGHT A COPY OF "THE ART OF THE DEAL" ON HIS LAST VISIT. IMPRESSIVE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEY HAVE A CHANGE OF HEATER. GREG: BUT BACK THEN EVERYONE THOUGHT RODMAN WAS NUTS TO GO OVER THERE. HE WAS VILIFIED BUSINESS HE WAS VILIFIED BYSINESS HE WAS VILIFIED BY HNESS HE WAS VILIFIED BY HISSS HE WAS VILIFIED BY HIS OWN NATION. IN 2014 SOME JERK HAD THE NERVE TO SAY DENNIS RODMAN IS ANOTHER IN A LONG LINE OF WESTERN PAWNS. JERK. WHICH WAS THE POLITE WAY OF SAYING THIS. HE'S A WIMP. AFTER ALL HE'S GOING THERE TO CELEBRATE HIS BUD'S BIRTHDAY. RODMAN IS THE MARILYN MONROE TO KIM JONG-UN'S JFK. HE'S LITTLE KIM'S LITTLE BITCH. GREG: HANDSOME FELLOW BUT VERY NAIVE. DID NOT AGE WELL. I TELL YOU WHAT, TO JUST TO MAKE AMENDS, IF THIS SUMMIT HAPPENS I WILL NOMINATE DENNIS RODMAN FOR THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE AND I'LL EVEN SUBMIT THIS VIDEO. IN 2017 THE INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO ABOLISH NUCLEAR WEAPONS WON THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. BUT THIS YEAR THAT HONOR SHOULD BELONG TO ONE MAN ONLY, DENNIS RODMAN. ONE LOOK AT HIS IMPRESSIVE RESUME AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY WHY. HE FIRST TEAMED UP WITH THE MUSCLE FROM BRUSSELS JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAM. A YEAR LATER HE MARRIED CARMEN ELECTRA WHO QUICKLY DIVORCED HIM. SOON AFTER HE FINISHED HIS PROCAREER WITH 11,954 REBOUNDS. FOR COMPARISON, THE 2007 NOBEL PRIZE WINNER AL GORE HAS ZERO CAREER REBOUNDS. WAS HE ALWAYS A FIGHTER? WHEN PEOPLE WANTED TO WEAR BRIGHTLY DYED HAIR IN PUBLIC, RODMAN WAS THERE. WHEN "CELEBRITY APPRENTICE" NEEDED A BOOST, RODMAN WAS THERE. AND HE DIT QUIT. WHEN THE WORLD NEEDED TO SAVE THE PROBLEM OF NORTH KOREA, RODMAN WAS THERE. DENNIS RODMAN, THE CLEAR CHOICE FOR THE 2018 NO BOHL PEACE FOR THE 2018 NOBBOHL PEACE FOR THE 2018 NOBELHL PEACE FOR THE 2018 NOBEL P PEACE FOR THE 2018 NOBEL PEAEACE FOR THE 2018 NOBEL PEACECE FOR THE 2018 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. GREG: TYRUS. OH, OF COURSE YOU WENT TO ME FIRST.
