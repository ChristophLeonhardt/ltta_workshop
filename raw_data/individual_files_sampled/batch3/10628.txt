anti-government activism in the United States has become increasingly confrontational with a new emphasis on ostracizing and humiliating elected officials Sarah Huckabee Sanders the White House press secretary found this out the hard way when she made the mistake of trying to eat out in a nice restaurant last night I was told by the owner of red Han in Lexington Virginia to leave because I work for POTUS and I politely left the Secretary of Homeland Security had a very similar experience however she actually made it to her table inside the restaurant first however she couldn't enjoy her meal before things got ugly after she left the restaurant the mob set up shop outside of her home we all know that the anonymity of the Internet brings out the best in people right well after they refused to serve Sanders the Red Hen Network has been subject to all kinds of threats and false reviews meanwhile several internet platforms are trying to stop the circulation of immigration customs enforcement employees by anti-trump activists as Immigration and Customs Enforcement continues to ramp up its inhumane surveillance and detention efforts I believe it's important to document what's happening and by whom in any way we can to that end I've downloaded made available the profiles of almost everyone on LinkedIn who works for Immigration and Customs Enforcement 1595 people in total things have gotten rough before between supporters of the administration and Street activists however elected officials always step in and tell folks to be civil and respectful not anymore yes a primary theme of the anti-trump movement at the moment is analogies to 1930s Germany this policy of family separation reminds us of that cattle cars of Nazi Germany when children were separated from their parents and marched to supposed showers slave traders use these tactics Nazis use these tactics terrorists use these tactics and now the President of the United States is using these tactics bottom line Donald Trump increasingly looks like Hitler and Nazi Germany these look like to concentrate its revenge on most would agree that's a pretty extreme exaggeration but members of the Trump camp aren't exactly helping themselves when they let racist language fly you're out of your cotton-picking mind David bossy apologized for that comment but the damage is already done and now we've got Steve King referring to migrant children as gang material young boys all old enough to be tried as adults or serve in the military and our prime ms-13 gang material and certainly grew up in the culture of one of the top ten most violent countries in the world nobody in this country who understands history wants to encourage anybody to move a political debate into a zone of reckless civil disobedience and violence people in the media who blow these charges up without actually dressing down those who might make those accusations are inciting a kind of riotous debate hang on you have a duty to be fair and balanced you have a duty to seek out the truth and publish the truth and you have a responsibility not to shout fire in a crowded and crowded theater so we mobs yelling Nazi internet threats racial slurs taunts and calls for violence with ingredients like that the story never really ends well Caleb Maupin RT New York you
