and scary animation is called horror
short film this animation was made by
riff studio an alternate studio I'm
leaving all the description stuff on in

behind that animation is that like
humans are the real monsters Jesus
Christ all right so the next animation
is called who's hungry okay now I found
this animation it's really old okay it's
uploaded like eight years ago okay all I
can see from it is that it's not for
little children so if your little child

children all right so we've got an ice
cream bag Jesus Christ this does it like
it was played eight years ago

want to watch them to up so I'm not sure
this is scary or not regardless though
it was made by Ali

assignment at animation mentor okay
let's give it a wash okay greed a short
film by Ali said Gaga Nanami
okay there's only two minutes long so I
love these short stories okay they're so

greed and it just shows some greedy man
