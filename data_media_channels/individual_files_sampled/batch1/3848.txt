I think for a few reasons men are less likely to do the bar method because they may think it's a ballet class we do use a ballet bar in the classroom but it's certainly not a ballet class so I think that that notion may make men feel like it's not necessarily for them I only tend to hear about it from women no men take this class and then the more I read about it it seems like it works all of your muscle groups it makes you leaner it tones very specific areas and I'm wondering why do only women take the class good first the bar method exercises are isometric which means they're really small and they're very low impact which is an important piece of the bar method because even though they're very challenging they're not going to have a negative impact on your muscles and your joints so you're gonna walk away feeling stronger but also healthier not like you just got the wind knocked out of you you feel really good you kept telling me smaller smaller motions smaller more like focused motions I'm just not used to and used to like just this you know and like this and this the way that we work the muscles we work them to the point of exhaustion and that's what can really change the shape of a muscle and out really look like you're more toned it just feels like I've worked groups that I have never worked or haven't worked in that way right so I'm sold I think it's awesome I would definitely do this again
