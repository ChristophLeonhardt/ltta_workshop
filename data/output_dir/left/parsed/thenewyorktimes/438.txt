Welcome to the Baltimore City
Police Crime Lab
firearms reference collection.
I'm Jim Wagster. I'm a 
firearms examiner 
at the Baltimore City
Police Department.
This reference collection is
all firearms
that were recovered 
off the street.
Every year we get approximately
3,000 firearms in.
Sometimes a little more,
sometimes it's a little less,
but the average being right
around 3,000.
to my right here is just a
collection of some
of the semiautomatics.
They run from a Beretta,
like was issued to
the military and a lot of the
police departments,
and also down to German 
World War II firearms.
This is a more modern 12 gauge
pump action shotgun. 
It's more representative of
what we get in now.
Behind me is a collection of
semiautomatics.
They run from .25s, .32s, 
.380s, 9 millimeters.
And this is just typical of the
smaller type caliber 
semiautomatic pistols.
