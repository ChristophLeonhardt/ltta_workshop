A GOOD ONE TO WATCH. THE PRESIDENT IS THERE TODAY. Bill: WE'VE GOT TIME FOR THIS. NIKKI HALEY LAST NIGHT AT THE AL SMITH DINNER WAS THE KEYNOTE. IT'S A REAL YOU GO BACK DECADES NOW AND IT'S A REAL HONOR FOR THESE POLITICIANS. HERE IS HOW IT WENT LAST NIGHT. LAST YEAR YOU WENT TO PAUL RYAN, WHO IS A BOY SCOUT. THAT'S FINE. A LITTLE BORING. SO THIS YEAR YOU WANTED TO SPICE THINGS UP AGAIN, RIGHT? I GET IT. YOU WANTED AN INDIAN WOMAN, BUT ELIZABETH WARREN FAILED HER DNA TEST. WHEN THE PRESIDENT FOUND OUT THAT I WAS INDIAN AMERICAN HE ASKED ME IF I WAS FROM THE SAME TRIBE AS ELIZABETH WARREN. Bill: PRETTY GOOD LINE. SHE IS A STAR, A STAR. Bill: WHAT DOES SHE DO NEXT? I DON'T KNOW BUT SHE WON'T GO AWAY. SHE WILL BE A PLAYER IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE NEED WOMEN LIKE HER AND SHE WILL BE A STAR. Julie: SHE SAYS SHE WON'T RUN JUST CAMPAIGN FOR TRUMP. IT WOULDN'T BE SMART TO RUN AGAINST TRUMP IN TWO YEARS BUT SHE CAN BE A SENATOR IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. SHE HAS BEEN THE GOVERNOR.
