Treasury secretary Steve minuchin had asked for a government jet in order to travel to Scotland France and Italy for his honeymoon now he rescinded that request after of course people raised their eyebrows because you're not supposed to use taxpayer funds for your honeymoon but ABC News broke the story they did a great report we have a portion of it for you let's take a quick look newly married this past summer multimillionaire Treasury Secretary Stephen minuchin formally requested that he and his new wife Louise regularly seen in designer clothes with purses at ten thousand dollars plus be allowed to travel in style in a government jet on their honeymoon to Europe and an estimated cost of twenty five thousand dollars an hour the price for taxpayers would have been several hundred thousand dollars they can't be expecting taxpayers to foot the bill whole for Hollywood lifestyle but the Newton's honeymoon request was withdrawn after officials reportedly raised the issue of how it would look for a man worth more than 300 million dollars to take a personal trip at taxpayer expense so also keep in mind that minuchin is now being investigated at least some of his actions using taxpayer money have gone or goings are going through an investigation so he triggered a review of his travel for using a government jet to travel to Louisville and Fort Knox Kentucky last month the Inspector General is reviewing whether he improperly used that trip to catch a prime view of the solar eclipse with his wife now Newton's office though has strongly denied this they're like no there's no way it's all you know official business however keep in mind that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell met with minuchin during that trip and tweeted a photo of them watching the Eclipse together complete with proper eyewear so the reason why this is all got on the news in the first place is because his wife Mary Antoinette got off that government flight and bragged about all of her designer clothes and put it on Instagram as they were going to Fort Knox to check out all the gold that they would later steal no just partially kidding it's called tax cuts its wealth redistribution to the top which is perfectly fine okay so anyway they'll and she does all that somebody criticizes her and then she says oh how adorable you know you know that we pay more taxes than you so so you know basically we have more of a right than you do to use government resources okay so in that rant she even talked about like do you think we'd take you know this air force to our honeymoon she literally said that and it turns out they did they tried they tried to take it to their honeymoon so they're alleging that she didn't know about the requests for the government jet I don't know if I believe that I don't care what I do care about is that our Treasury secretary who has become fabulously wealthy off of foreclosing on people's homes in an unlawful way has the audacity to ask for taxpayers to foot the bill for his lavish lifestyle if you're worth a hundred hundreds of millions of dollars how about you pay for your own private jet okay and he said as an excuse for the honeymoon request well we just wanted to make sure that he had you know proper communication with government officials in Washington if he needed because you know you can't have communication if you're on a plane with other humans no no no you have to be at a fancy government place he doesn't even need to be on a plane with other humans right she can just take a bribe exactly like it's just so brazen like the fact that they put in that request is incredible to me and I'm glad that they're being investigated for so look credit to ABC News here which I actually fairly regularly credit because they are one of the few folks on TV who do investigations and here it is again Brian Ross and his team do a wonderful job of investigating this finding this out so great job by that check out the whole video okay now I'll add my little bit of speculation on top so given the so did they actually go to Kentucky on the original trip that got him in trouble to watch their clips absolutely because here's what I I looked at I looked at their excuses they said oh we're going to visit Fort Knox why Tracy Secretary doesn't have to physically look at the gold in Fort Knox to know that it's there that's a preposterous excuse and secondly where there was a talk of tax reform really who were you talking thanks reform with Mitch McConnell then there's a picture of him and Mitch McConnell looking at the solar eclipse of course they went to go see the solar eclipse you know what happened he just got married that's why this whole thing it would be scandal about the honeymoon to this actress slash motto and he's trying to impress her he's like oh you're gonna go on Air Force two and go on our honeymoon to Scotland France and Italy and then you Treasury secretary oh you want to go and check the solar eclipse in in Kentucky let's just use this suckers that are the American taxpayers so I can impress you because I'm 88 years older than you and but I have a lot of money and I have a lot of clout she's like oh my god I love it let's go or maze and this and that scarves hashtag adorable TYT membership gives you commercial free Young Turks downloaded streaming podcasts that get all the network shows and support
