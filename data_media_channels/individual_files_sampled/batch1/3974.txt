next question is from Jonathan will Microsoft become a credible player in the mobile OS Wars what Microsoft what mobile s OS with Microsoft deliver or what have they delivered in the past you know the answer that question is becoming no more each day Microsoft has had a history of decent mobile os's dating until about two thousand seven when the iphone came out and made everybody looks silly and since then they've made some minor tweaks to windows mobile but nothing major that would put it on the same level as iphone android or even palm webos so I've heard that the new microsoft windows mobile seven which is based on kind of the zune the new zune HD framework kind of looking like that is actually pretty good but that's not going to help that much if they can't get mobile manufacturers and carriers and developers to embrace Microsoft again and as Apple and Android really kind of kick everyone else's butts in that field it's going to be very hard for Microsoft even with all that money behind it even with its past relationships even with some weird deal at signed with LG recently to catch up where it's falling behind so I would say the odds of Microsoft becoming an important player here you can never count them out they can easily buy rim they could easily buy palm they could do a lot of things to become a big player through acquisition organically I think it's going to really take a miracle for them so we'll see how good windows mobile seven is I get a hunch we're going to hear a lot about it next month at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona I get a feeling they're going to have to ship it by the end of the year otherwise it's probably too late and they'll have to buy some one and from Adam why do many large companies continue to create lousy products rather than focus on fewer better products and one of the examples he gave with Sony Ericsson which used to make great phones and I had three of them which I love for many years you know has this problem where they have 50 different phones or hundred phones a year Motorola had this very problem where they had six operating systems into development and you look at the counter example which is apple or palm where they have to you know one phone two phones something like that one of the reasons for in the mobile industry specifically is the way that phones are distributed worldwide and that is in a carrier system so in the u.s. Motorola may make four versions of the same phone with very minor tweaks so one at verizon one at t-mobile one at sprint one at 80 I'm sure that this is a hassle for them on the back end but this is something where they have customers who want to have something differentiated they want to say they have the only you know Q 302 C model they want to have something different to be able to market to consumers is it the best way of doing things I think that the answer we found out especially his phone's become more expensive and smarter is no and I think that's why we're going to see things like the droid which motorola is using as the basis for a phone for verizon here but also overseas I think we'll start to see more stuff like the iPhone where a manufacturer will have one phone that they sell on multiple carriers if you look at palm they're doing it with the palm pre plus and a pixi plus it's very similar verizon and sprint but the bottom line is I think we'll see simpler product lines fewer operating systems / manufacturer because software is really what sets phones apart these days not the color of the case or the way the keyboard looks or something like that it's the it's the apps and the operating system so i think that the companies that don't adapt that will have problems nokia has had problems lately they've been slow to adapt to that and Apple of course has been very successful with that and the last question comes from Eric W who asks what are your thoughts on the whole mobile social thing regarding Foursquare and Yelp and gowalla do you think Facebook is going to turn on location soon so what is this mobile social thing foursquare is kind of the example that everyone uses right now because they are the newest and we're one of the newest and one of the most popular in this little niche and this niche is I have a phone that has is a powerful processor and a GPS unit in it I can use that to tell my friends where I am I can find out where my friends are I can send pictures and information with my location tag to it and share that with my friends and only now this stuff has been around for a little while there's companies like loopt that have been selling this sort of stuff for years but now we're starting to get into a period where there's actually practical uses for it where foursquare to people who are social and who go out actually find something useful out of this it is helpful to know where your friends are without having to call them or message them especially if they're really proactive about filling out this information recently there's been a push from other companies that have other social aspects of them to move into this mobile area so Yelp for example which has a very popular website and a popular iPhone app has added this kind of check-in activity to the yelp app and a lot of people were wondering ok it's Foursquare already dead is Yelp going to come kick their butts I don't think Yelp is going to be the one that gives them much trouble Yelp obviously is bigger than four square but Yelp who's actually friends with people on yelp I mean if you're friends with people on Yelp it's people that you know from Yelp and those are not the people you're going to be hanging out with in person so I think the biggest trouble for foursquare could be Facebook because that's really where people are friends with the people they associate with in real life Twitter you kind of follow people that you know from the internet Yelp you hang out with people I don't know what you do on Yelp you talk to people who go the same restaurant as you do that you probably don't know but Facebook is the site where you interact with people you do know who you would hang out with who you'd want to run into at a bar so if Facebook Ads some sort of check-in location thing that could be trouble for foursquare when I talk to Mark Zuckerberg about that over a year ago he said location is important to me but I you know we're figuring out how to put it into facebook there's obviously a lot of privacy issues around that infrastructure issues and security and things like that and the idea that they would be screwing over some of their developer partners like Foursquare so at some point I imagine Facebook will do some around this I think they're more focused now in advertising and payments but as this continues to grow as more people use foursquare and gowalla and services like that i think that facebook will have to do something eventually and that's it next week we'll have another one of these and look out for a post on silicon alley insider where you can ask your questions and have them answered on camera thanks for watching
