1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
how to find these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are for your videos</font>

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,380
the it's hard there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,089
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways that you can find music</font>

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,580
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your videos and I'll go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over a few</font>

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,700
of them pre pretty quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the first</font>

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">one is fine music for your videos is to</font>

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,870
just use copyrighted music this is

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely a used at your own risk type</font>

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,380
situation so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example youtube has a</font>

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,769
music policies section and you can go in

11
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,920
there and see one the popularity of the

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,520
song you're trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use and to what</font>

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,070
are the restrictions on it now usually

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,190
most songs the restrictions are

15
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,540
different countries that the song just

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,210
won't play in if you upload a video with

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,570
the samel in it and or monetization

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,789
restrictions and usually what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is that</font>

19
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,670
you can't monetize the video anymore but

20
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,000
the copyright holder of the song can

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,870
monetize the videos so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example this</font>

22
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,180
week in beta<font color="#CCCCCC"> I shot a docu blog about</font>

23
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,709
just my day it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a day in the life</font>

24
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,610
type vlog and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe I called it the</font>

25
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,680
world is dull or something like that and

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,250
for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> vlog I used a song by this band</font>

27
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,970
called Sylvan Esso called coffee and I

28
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,540
used it because I really felt like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,630
song gave an overall mood and tone to

30
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,090
that video that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted which was kind</font>

31
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,920
of melancholy malaise and I combed

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,229
through all the other avenues that will

33
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,630
go over about<font color="#E5E5E5"> where to find music and I</font>

34
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,670
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like I could ever</font>

35
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,250
find a song that really gave that

36
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,950
feeling as well as that song did so for

37
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,520
me I am I looked up the copyright on

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,149
Sylvan Esso on YouTube platform saw that

39
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,009
I just couldn't monetize the video and

40
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,100
that whoever owns the rights to that

41
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,170
song which I'm assuming is sylvan<font color="#CCCCCC"> esas</font>

42
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,680
like you know music label or whatever

43
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,560
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to if they want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put ads</font>

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,399
on that video

45
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:12,010
and gain revenue from that which on

46
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,450
boundless because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean if that</font>

47
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">means Sylvan Esso gets a cut then cool</font>

48
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,250
because I really like that band so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

49
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,250
know that's one way to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again so</font>

50
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,769
use at your own risk kind of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta</font>

51
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,659
roll the dice on it and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope for</font>

52
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:28,540
the best on deck another thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

53
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,329
in mind too is the popularity of the

54
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:33,370
copyrighted music guys using you know

55
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of songs that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are really</font>

56
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:37,359
really popular and I like that YouTube

57
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:41,409
gives you a popularity gauge with the

58
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:42,849
song that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking up because i</font>

59
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:45,010
personally think if the song is very

60
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,099
very popular chances are it's actually

61
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:50,980
hindering the overall message and view

62
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,319
of your video more than it's helping and

63
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,079
that's because if the song is really

64
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,519
popular me know that means a lot of

65
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and a lot of people</font>

66
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:01,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">are already associating that song with</font>

67
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:04,450
something else when they hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that song</font>

68
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,849
they have a very specific vision of

69
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:09,609
something else that may collide with

70
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:12,970
what vision message story you're trying

71
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tell you know I used the Sylvan Esso</font>

72
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,400
song too because when I looked up looked

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,500
it up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube and I saw popularity</font>

74
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,470
tell me about half percent you know so

75
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">that probably means most of my audience</font>

76
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,049
doesn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Silva so you know and I'm</font>

77
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:31,930
actually introducing them to a new

78
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">artists generally speaking a good rule</font>

79
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:36,340
of thumb is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have heard the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> song</font>

80
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">and an ad already it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably too</font>

81
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,190
popular the next place that you could go

82
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,799
is YouTube itself YouTube does have an

83
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,560
archive of free music to its creators

84
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,169
that you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and use I have</font>

85
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:54,359
never used a free song off of youtube

86
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,549
archive just haven't done it most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

87
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:00,220
cuz I feel like it's free so that means

88
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,500
while there probably is some good tracks

89
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,049
on there again it's that same idea of

90
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:08,260
popularity I'm relatively sure the good

91
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,019
tracks have probably been used literally

92
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:13,630
millions of times so this

93
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,870
it's not going to add to my overall

94
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,940
aesthetic if you're watching my video

95
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,710
and you hear a song that you've heard on

96
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,870
40 other youtubers videos you know so

97
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's about differentiating yourself and</font>

98
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,860
how much that is worth to you are you

99
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,960
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose the potential Adsense</font>

100
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,880
revenue off of that video because you

101
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,120
really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> that song or are you not and</font>

102
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,530
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that case you need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find a song</font>

103
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,560
that you pay for and in general I mean

104
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,280
you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it when you can you</font>

105
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,050
know like pay artists the next one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

106
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that I use pretty regularly</font>

107
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,000
actually both professionally and on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,030
channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is bio jump with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

109
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">your jungle you pay per song and usually</font>

110
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,700
the songs are no more than thirty

111
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,080
dollars I don't think I've ever paid

112
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,610
more than thirty dollars for an audio

113
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,930
jungle song and you know there's a lot

114
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">of music on that platform however econo</font>

115
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,140
you have to go through and<font color="#E5E5E5"> find all the</font>

116
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,370
good songs you know for every other so

117
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,280
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel is a good song or a great</font>

118
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,140
song on audio jungle there's probably

119
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,760
about 300 min songs I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have combed</font>

120
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,100
through so many songs<font color="#E5E5E5"> but and purchased</font>

121
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,870
so many songs that the algorithm has

122
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,060
begun<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work in my favor on that</font>

123
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,330
platform and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different folders on</font>

124
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,490
there where I have like a vlogging

125
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,830
folder and a business<font color="#CCCCCC"> folder and all</font>

126
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,020
this like an avant-garde folder you know

127
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">just different genres and things like</font>

128
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,740
that another thing I do when I'm bored

129
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,480
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sitting at home kind of</font>

130
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,310
twiddling my thumbs I get on<font color="#E5E5E5"> audio</font>

131
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">jungle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and a start listening to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> songs</font>

132
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,420
without even having made a video that I

133
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,640
need a song for and finally the last

134
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,040
place that I'm pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure you can find</font>

135
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,260
decent music is through a

136
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,430
subscription-based service like epidemic

137
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,950
so it's subscription-based you sign up

138
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,090
and

139
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,220
essentially you pay a monthly fee and

140
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,500
you just get access you get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

141
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,110
their whole library and you can use

142
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,070
their songs on your your<font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube videos</font>

143
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,810
they're really cool thing about epidemic

144
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,810
too is that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually break up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> songs</font>

145
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,680
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bass beat the instrumentals of</font>

146
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,310
vocals so you can it just gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you more</font>

147
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,310
control in your cut to you know maybe

148
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,780
drop the bass out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this section</font>

149
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,919
because you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will work</font>

150
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,600
more visually with what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and</font>

151
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,460
bring the bass back in bring the drums

152
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,100
back down just it gives you so much you

153
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,020
can work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with I'm your first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> month was</font>

154
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,169
usually free on that platform and so for

155
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:55,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">me I have known of epidemic for a while</font>

156
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I went ahead and signed up for</font>

157
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,979
epidemic now during beta when I knew I'd

158
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:02,800
