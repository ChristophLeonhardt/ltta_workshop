OF LANGUAGE.

13
00:00:20,091 --> 00:00:21,659
>> THIS KIND OF STUFF IS A

14
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:23,394
DIRECT BY PRODUCT OF HOW

15
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:24,295
DONALD TRUMP BEHAVES AND

16
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:24,895

PRESIDENT HAS NOTHING TO DO

23
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:30,801
WITH IT.

24
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:34,605
THAT HE IS NOT EMBOLDENING

25
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:35,339
RACISTS AND RACISM AND

26
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:36,407
GIVING THEM A PLATFORM AND

27
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:40,411
MAKING IT OKAY.

28

ON THE SUBJECT OF TWEETS,

38
00:00:53,891 --> 00:00:55,960
WHICH NO NORMAL PERSON WOULD

39
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,293
DEFEND.

40
00:00:56,293 --> 00:00:57,128
THEY'RE AWFUL.

41
00:00:57,128 --> 00:00:58,596
WHY THE IMPULSE TO

00:00:58,596 --> 00:01:00,898
IMMEDIATELY MAKE IT A

43
00:01:00,898 --> 00:01:01,499
PARTISAN POLITICAL ISSUE

44
00:01:01,499 --> 00:01:02,666
WHEN THERE IS A HUMAN

00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,101
MESSAGE IN THIS CONVERSATION

46
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:04,968
WHICH IS DON'T ATTACK PEOPLE

47
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:06,137
ON THE BASIS OF THEIR RACE.

48
00:01:06,137 --> 00:01:07,004
LIKE IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

49
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:08,639
WHY THE IMPULSE TO MAKE IT

50
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:09,006
PARTISAN?

51
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:10,407
>> CERTAINLY WHAT ROSEANNE

52
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:12,109
BARR DID WAS PATHETIC NOT

53
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:13,410
JUST TO SAY IT BUT TO BLAME

54
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,478
IT ON AMBIEN.

55
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:15,713
SHE ALSO SAID IT WAS

56
00:01:15,713 --> 00:01:16,380
MEMORIAL DAY.

57
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,782
IT WAS -- AND THIS IS

58
00:01:17,782 --> 00:01:18,949
SOMEBODY WHO HAD SAID THE

59
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:20,384
EXACT SAME THING ABOUT SUSAN

60
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,684
RICE.

61
00:01:20,684 --> 00:01:22,820
WHO HAD BASICALLY DEFENDED

62
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,789
THE WHOLE --

63
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:25,689
>> Tucker: YOU DON'T NEED TO

64
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,258
CONVINCE ME THE TWEET WAS

65
00:01:27,258 --> 00:01:27,525
BAD.

66
00:01:27,525 --> 00:01:28,225
I'M THERE ALREADY.

67
00:01:28,225 --> 00:01:29,160
>> ACTUALLY THERE ARE PEOPLE

68
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,427
I SUSPECT WHO ACTUALLY ARE

69
00:01:30,427 --> 00:01:31,595
KIND OF JOINING TO HER

70
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:32,163
DEFENSE.

71
00:01:32,163 --> 00:01:32,530
RIGHT?

72
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,098
OH, THIS IS SOMEHOW HER

73
00:01:34,098 --> 00:01:35,566
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS ARE

74
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:37,234
BEING INFRINGED.

75
00:01:37,234 --> 00:01:37,668
NONSENSE.

76
00:01:37,668 --> 00:01:38,869
>> Tucker: WHAT I'M SAYING,

77
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:40,271
LOOK, FOR MOST OF MY ADULT

78
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:41,605
LIFE THE SENIOR DEMOCRAT IN

79
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:42,873
THE UNITED STATES SENATE WAS

80
00:01:42,873 --> 00:01:45,743
A FORMER CLAN RECRUITER.

81
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:46,043
OKAY?

82
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:46,577
ROBERT BYRD.

83
00:01:46,577 --> 00:01:48,045
A LOT OF THINGS NAMED AFTER

84
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:48,746
ROBERT BYRD.

85
00:01:48,746 --> 00:01:50,447
I'M NOT EVEN ATTACKING

86
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:51,649
ROBERT BYRD.

87
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:52,416
HE APOLOGIZED.

88
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,717
BUT LET'S GET A LITTLE

89
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:54,552
PROPORTION HERE.

90
00:01:54,552 --> 00:01:55,920
THE OUTRAGE IS SELECTIVE.

91
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,588
I'M NOT DEFENDING THE

92
00:01:57,588 --> 00:01:59,056
ROSEANNE CRAP, BUT I ALSO

93
00:01:59,056 --> 00:02:00,024
THINK WHEN PEOPLE ARE

94
00:02:00,024 --> 00:02:01,592
JUMPING UP AND DOWN ACTUALLY

95
00:02:01,592 --> 00:02:03,661
TRUMP DID THIS, IT'S PURELY

96
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:04,028
POLITICAL.

97
00:02:04,028 --> 00:02:04,595
LET'S BE HONEST.

98
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:05,529
>> ACTUALLY I THINK THAT

99
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:08,264
PEOPLE WHO DON'T SUBSCRIBE

100
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:09,866

101
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:10,234
FOLLOWING.

102
00:02:10,234 --> 00:02:10,800
DONALD TRUMP HAS GIVEN

103
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,969
LICENSE TO PEOPLE BY SAYING

104
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:14,104
THEY ARE GOOD NAZIS BY

105
00:02:14,104 --> 00:02:15,339
MOCKING HANDICAP PEOPLE.

106
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:17,942
BY BASICALLY, YOU KNOW.

107
00:02:17,942 --> 00:02:18,642
>> Tucker: MOCKING HANDY CAP

108
00:02:18,642 --> 00:02:18,976
PEOPLE.

109
00:02:18,976 --> 00:02:20,744
>> REMEMBER HE WENT LIKE

110
00:02:20,744 --> 00:02:22,012
THIS BY "NEW YORK TIMES"

111
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:22,479
REPORTER.

112
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,081
>> Tucker: WAS HE MOCKING

113
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:25,916
ALL HANDICAPPED PEOPLE.

114
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,084
>> IT WAS THAT GUY.

115
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:28,052
IT WAS PATHETIC.

116
00:02:28,052 --> 00:02:29,386
THE LIST IS ON AND ON.

117
00:02:29,386 --> 00:02:30,654
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

118
00:02:30,654 --> 00:02:31,322
THOUGH, WHEN DONALD TRUMP

119
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:32,489
DOES THAT AND PEOPLE SAY

120
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,058
WELL, HE WON, SO HIS STAFF

121
00:02:34,058 --> 00:02:37,094
CAN GO WELL I CAN MIMIC

122
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:38,963
PEOPLE AND MAKE FUN OF JOHN

123
00:02:38,963 --> 00:02:39,530
MCCAIN WHO IS DYING.

124
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,397
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

125
00:02:40,397 --> 00:02:41,665
THEN PEOPLE WHO ARE

126
00:02:41,665 --> 00:02:43,434
SUPPORTERS THINK AT HIS

127
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:44,902
RALLIES PEOPLE WHO COVER HIS

128
00:02:44,902 --> 00:02:46,470
RALLIES SAY THESE PEOPLE

129
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,504
WERE LOVELY AND THEN THE

130
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:48,672
RALLY WOULD START AND THEY

131
00:02:48,672 --> 00:02:53,177
WOULD SAY THE MOST

132
00:02:53,177 --> 00:02:53,677
ANTI-SEMITIC.

133
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:55,746
>> Tucker: I HAVE BEEN ON

134
00:02:55,746 --> 00:02:57,414
TELEVISION FOR 1020 YEARS

135
00:02:57,414 --> 00:02:59,750
THE NASTINESS OF HATE MAIL I

136
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,452
RECEIVE REMAINS CONSTANT.

137
00:03:01,452 --> 00:03:04,421
I DIDN'T BLAME OBAMA FOR THE

138
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:05,890
HATE MAIL AND DEATH THREATS

139
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,857
I GOT.

140
00:03:06,857 --> 00:03:08,626
I DIDN'T BLAME OBAMA.

141
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:09,760
THIS IS A LARGER QUESTION.

142
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,895
PART OF THE QUESTION IS, DO

143
00:03:10,895 --> 00:03:13,430
PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGING IN

144
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,832
RACISM, LIKE AL SHARPTON,

145
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:16,033
HAVE THE RIGHT TO LECTURE

146
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:18,335
THE REST OF US ABOUT RACISM?

147
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:19,670
DO THEY?

148
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,938
IS AL SHARPTON THE SPOKESMAN

149
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:22,206
YOU WANT AGAINST RACISM,

150
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:22,539
REALLY?

151
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:24,041
>> NO, HE IS NOT.

152
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:24,909
I AGREE WITH YOU.

153
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:26,944
BUT I DO THINK IT IS

154
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:28,112
UNDENIABLE THAT THE FACT

155
00:03:28,112 --> 00:03:29,013
THAT DONALD TRUMP SPEWS WHAT

156
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:30,581
HE DID ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL

157
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:32,216
AND AS PRESIDENT TO TALK

158
00:03:32,216 --> 00:03:33,417
ABOUT GOOD NAZIS IS

159
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:34,218
SOMETHING THAT SENDS A

160
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:36,153

PEOPLE.

163
00:03:37,988 --> 00:03:39,590
AND IT'S WHY HE TWEETS ABOUT

EVERY STUPID THING UNDER THE

165
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:42,593

I CERTAINLY AM.

174

IF IT'S NOT, THEN WHY DO WE

195
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:14,625
CARE ABOUT ROSEANNE SAID.

196
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,326
IF THERE IS.

197
00:04:15,326 --> 00:04:16,694
YOU SHOULDN'T BASE PEOPLE ON

198
00:04:16,694 --> 00:04:18,262
THE BASIS OF

199
00:04:18,262 --> 00:04:18,862
CHARACTERISTICS, DO YOU

200
00:04:18,862 --> 00:04:19,363
AGREE WITH THAT.

201
00:04:19,363 --> 00:04:21,899
>> I THINK ROSEANNE BARR AND

202
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,901
PEOPLE LIKE HER TO HO TALK

203
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:25,402
ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE AS APES

204
00:04:25,402 --> 00:04:27,004
IS WRONG.

205
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:28,138
>> Tucker: I AGREE.

206
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:29,073
IT'S DISGUSTING.

207
00:04:29,073 --> 00:04:30,407
IS IT WRONG TO DISCRIMINATE

208
00:04:30,407 --> 00:04:31,475
AGAINST SOMEONE ON THE BASIS

209
00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:33,210
OF A SKIN COLOR, TO HOLD

210
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,144
THEM BACK ON THE BASIS OF

211
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:34,611
THEIR SKIN.

212
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:36,013
IT'S A REALLY SIMPLE ANSWER.

213
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:36,580
CAN YOU ANSWER IT.

214
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,182
>> OF COURSE, BUT, YOU ARE

215
00:04:38,182 --> 00:04:39,850
ACTING LIKE SOMEHOW SLAVERY

216
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,784
DIDN'T HAPPEN.

217
00:04:40,784 --> 00:04:41,385
>> Tucker: I DIDN'T SAY

218
00:04:41,385 --> 00:04:41,685
THAT.

219
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:43,053
>> THAT'S THE INTIMATION YOU

220
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:45,556
ARE GETTING AT.

221
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:46,056
>> Tucker: PLEASE.

222
00:04:46,056 --> 00:04:46,657
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE

223
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:47,324
GETTING AT.

224
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:47,992
>> Tucker: THAT'S NOT WHAT

225
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:49,226
I'M GETTING AT.

226
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:50,194
I AM A STRAIGHTFORWARD

227
00:04:50,194 --> 00:04:50,627
PERSON.

228
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:51,462
DON'T ATTACK ME.

229
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:53,530
I'M ASKING YOU ABOUT A

230
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:53,897
PRINCIPLE.

231
00:04:53,897 --> 00:04:54,865
WHICH IS IT WRONG TO HURT

232
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:56,467
PEOPLE, TO HOLD THEM BACK,

233
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:57,634
DENY THEM THINGS THEY WOULD

234
00:04:57,634 --> 00:04:58,502
OTHERWISE GET BECAUSE OF

235
00:04:58,502 --> 00:04:59,336
THEIR RACE?

236
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:00,771
IT'S A REALLY SIMPLE

237
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:01,305
QUESTION YES OR NO.

238
00:05:01,305 --> 00:05:02,439
>> I AGREE THAT PEOPLE

239
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,508
SHOULD NOT BE DISCRIMINATED

240
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:04,908
AGAINST.

241
00:05:04,908 --> 00:05:05,342
>> Tucker: NO.

242
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:06,010
PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTION.

243
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:06,977
>> THEY SHOULD NOT BE

244
00:05:06,977 --> 00:05:07,711
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST THEIR

245
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,012
FACE.

246
00:05:08,012 --> 00:05:09,446
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A

247
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:10,214
COLORBLIND SOCIETY.

248
00:05:10,214 --> 00:05:11,582
ERIC HOLDER AND OTHER BLACK

249
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:12,783
CABINET OFFICIALS HAVE

250
00:05:12,783 --> 00:05:15,686
TROUBLE HAILING A TAXICAB.

251
00:05:15,686 --> 00:05:16,420
>> Tucker: BY THE WAY, I'M

252
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,621
NOT DENYING THAT.

253
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,056
I'M MERELY SAYING IS IT

254
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:21,191
WRONG TO PRACTICE RACISM

255
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:21,792
AGAINST PEOPLE?

256
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,027
>> OF COURSE.

257
00:05:23,027 --> 00:05:23,460
>> Tucker: IT.

258
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,395
>> YES.

259
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:24,995
>> Tucker: YOU WOULD SAY

260
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:26,497
IT'S TOTALLY WRONG TO SAY TO

261
00:05:26,497 --> 00:05:28,432
A CHILD BECAUSE OF YOUR SKIN

262
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:29,900
COLOR WE'RE HOLDING YOU

263
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,200
BACK?

264
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,368
THERE IS A MASSIVE LAWSUIT

265
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:32,536
AGAINST HARVARD RIGHT NOW BY

266
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:34,471
ASIAN STUDENTS WHO ARE

267
00:05:34,471 --> 00:05:35,272
BASICALLY PROVEN THAT

268
00:05:35,272 --> 00:05:36,240
HARVARD DIDN'T LET THEM IN

269
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,007
BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE.

270
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:38,375
>> RIGHT.

271
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,143
>> Tucker: IS THAT OKAY WITH

272
00:05:39,143 --> 00:05:39,410
YOU.

273
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,978
>> JEWS USED TO BE SUBJECTED

274
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:42,746
TO THE EXACT SAME THING.

275
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:43,514
>> Tucker: WITH T. WAS

276
00:05:43,514 --> 00:05:44,314
WRONG.

277
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:45,249
LIBERALS SUPPORT IT NOW.

278
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:47,384
>> RIGHT.

279
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:48,085
>> Tucker: THOSE PEOPLE

280
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:49,620
LECTURE ME ABOUT RACISM.

281
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,689
>> VIRTUE IN DIVERSITY.

282
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:53,257
>> Tucker: VIRTUE NEW

283
00:05:53,257 --> 00:05:53,724
DISCRIMINATION?

284
00:05:53,724 --> 00:05:54,792
>> CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT

285
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:56,060
TUCK TONGUE I'M CALLING IT

286
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,460
WHAT IT IS.

287
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,429
WE BOTH AGREED THAT

288
00:05:58,429 --> 00:05:59,063
PENALIZING PEOPLE ON THE

289
00:05:59,063 --> 00:06:00,697
BASIS OF THEIR RACE IS

290
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:02,232
IMMORAL YOU AGREED WITH THAT

291
00:06:02,232 --> 00:06:03,133
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW FULL

292
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:05,669
SUPPORT OF LIBERALS SAME

293
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:06,837
ONES LECTURING US ABOUT

294
00:06:06,837 --> 00:06:07,471
RACISM IT'S TOO MUCH.

295
00:06:07,471 --> 00:06:08,972
>> I'M SAYING THERE IS A

296
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:10,774
QUILT INVOLVED AND, YES,

297
00:06:10,774 --> 00:06:11,341
DISCRIMINATING AGAINST

298
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:12,443
PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR

299
00:06:12,443 --> 00:06:14,378
SKIN COLOR IS WRONG.

300
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:15,412
BUT PEOPLE WERE HELD BACK

301
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:17,214
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

302
00:06:17,214 --> 00:06:17,748
>> Tucker: I AGREE.

303
00:06:17,748 --> 00:06:18,982
>> TO BASICALLY ACT LIKE

304
00:06:18,982 --> 00:06:20,350
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

305
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:20,984
>> Tucker: I'M NOT ACTING

306
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:21,819
LIKE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

307
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:23,020
I THINK IT'S THE CENTRAL SIN

308
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,554
OF AMERICA.

309
00:06:23,554 --> 00:06:24,655
I HAVE THINK IT'S OUR

310
00:06:24,655 --> 00:06:25,255
ORIGINAL SIN.

311
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:26,457
I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE.

312
00:06:26,457 --> 00:06:27,291
BUT, I DON'T THINK THAT

313
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,258
RACISM IS OKAY.

314
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:29,393
AND LIBERALS DO.

315
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:31,161
AND I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR

316
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:32,196
AND I WANT OUR VIEWERS TO

317
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:32,896
UNDERSTAND THAT IS THE

318
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:33,564
OFFICIAL POSITION OF THE

319
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:34,765
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS THAT

320
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:35,599
HURTING PEOPLE ON THE BASIS

321
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:37,734
OF THEIR RACE IS A-OKAY?

322
00:06:37,734 --> 00:06:39,403
>> NO.

323
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:40,070
THE POSITION OF THE

324
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,771
DEMOCRATIC PARTIES IS THAT

325
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:42,439
WE HAVE TO TAKE COGNIZANCE

326
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,373
OF THE FACT THAT WHAT

327
00:06:43,373 --> 00:06:44,975
HAPPENED FOR 200 YEARS AND

328
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:46,376
IF WE ACT LIKE IT DIDN'T

329
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:48,812
HAPPEN, AND THAT SOMEHOW OR

330
00:06:48,812 --> 00:06:49,213
ANOTHER.

331
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:50,147
>> Tucker: I'M NOT

332
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:50,781
SUGGESTING THAT NO.

333
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:52,916
>> ACT LIKE SKIN COLOR

334
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:53,684
DOESN'T MATTER.

335
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:55,419
THAT SIGNATURE NORIEGA THE

336
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:55,819
OBVIOUS.

>> RIGHT.

341

342
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,657
BECAUSE OF HIS RACE.

343
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:00,958
