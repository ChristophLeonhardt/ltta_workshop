CHINA HAS PUT A STOP TO ANONYMOUS COMMENTS ON THE INTERNET. MASHABLE REPORTS: CHINA HAS MADE A LOT OF MOVES RECENTLY TO CUT DOWN ON ANONYMOUS POSTING AND MEANS BY WHICH PEOPLE TYPICALLY GET AROUND THE ALREADY STRINGENT CHECKS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS ON INTERNET TRAFFIC. WHAT YOU THINK? THIS IS A TOUGH ONE BECAUSE I GENERALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO USE THEIR REAL IDENTITY AND I HAVE A PROPOSAL HERE FOR TWITTER IN AMERICA, BUT WHEN THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT DOES IT, IT TAKES ON A DIFFERENT TINGE. BECAUSE IF YOU ARE CRITICIZING THE GOVERNMENT, THEY DEFINITELY WANT TO BE ABLE TO TRACK YOU. THAT IS WHY I DON'T WANT TO GO ALL THE WAY AND SAY THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED FOR ANY PLATFORM AS CHINA'S DOING. I THINK THAT IS WRONG. HERE IN AMERICA TWITTER HAS A MASSIVE PROBLEM WHERE YOU HAVE THE EGGS AND NO ONE KNOWS WHO IS REAL AND WHO IS NOT. THEY GO THROUGH EXTRA EFFORT TO DO THE VERIFIED ACCOUNTS, THAT'S THE BLUE CHECK YOU SEE. PEOPLE THINK THAT MEANS THEY ARE A CELEBRITY. ACTUALLY MEANS THEY MADE SURE THAT THAT WAS AN ACTUAL HUMAN BEING BUT I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A MIDDLE GROUND REDO A GREEN CHECK WHICH IS AT LEAST THIS GUY CONNECTED IT TO HIS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT OR ANY OTHER ACCOUNTS. THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE THAT HE MIGHT BE REAL AND I AM NOT SAYING GET RID OF ANONYMOUS COMMENTS ON TWITTER, GOD FORBID. I AM JUST SAYING GIVE US ONE MORE LAYER SO WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHO SOMEONE IS. SOME PEOPLE, I PROPOSED THAT WHAT AND THEY'RE LIKE, OH MY GOD. YOU ARE A MAOIST ISLAMIST. YOU ARE ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY COMMENT. IT COULD BE ANONYMOUS OR HATEFUL. ALL OF THE HORRIFIC THINGS YOU WANT TO DO. I'M JUST SAYING IF YOU CREATE A SECOND LAYER IT GIVES PEOPLE CONFIDENCE, AT LEAST THIS PERSON IS A REAL PERSON WHO HATES ME. AND NOT A BOT. THERE ARE BOTS THAT POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS WILL ROLLOUT IN ORDER TO HELP THEM SPREAD WHATEVER THEY WANT TO SPREAD. DEMOCRATS USE BOTS TOO. I THINK THAT'S AN INTERESTING PROPOSAL BUT OBVIOUSLY KEEP IN MIND, CHINA IS NOT DOING IT FOR THAT PURPOSE. THEY ARE DOING IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE PEOPLE WHO CRITICIZE THE GOVERNMENT. THEY DON'T EVEN LIKE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO INVESTIGATE FACTORIES IN CHINA. THERE WERE SOME JOURNALISTS OR INVESTIGATORS LOOKING INTO HOW CHINA CONTRACTED WITH IVANKA TRUMP'S COMPANY AND SOME OF THEM JUST GOT DETAINED. SOME OF THEM WENT MISSING. THAT IS SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN STORIES LIKE THIS COME OUT. IT IS NOT REALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE PEOPLE IDENTIFY THEMSELVES TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE REAL.
