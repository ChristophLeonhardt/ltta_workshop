00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:14,318
TOP OF THE HOUR.

3
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:17,454
HELSINKI MANIPULATES AWAY.

4
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:20,157
THIS HAPPENED MOMENTS AGO.

5
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:20,991
ABBY: THIS IS VLADIMIR PUTIN

6
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,126

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP ALSO

9
00:00:24,396 --> 00:00:24,995
EXPECTED ANY MOMENT.

10
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:26,530
WE KNOW HE HAS LEFT HIS

11
00:00:26,531 --> 00:00:26,964
RESIDENCE.

12
00:00:26,965 --> 00:00:27,431
HE IS ENROUTE.

13
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:28,933
HE WILL BE AT THE PALATES IN

14
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:30,234
JUST MINUTES.

15
00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:31,635
STEVE: JOINING US RIGHT NOW

16
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:33,204

JOINS US FROM LONDON.

22
00:00:42,814 --> 00:00:43,948
AINSLEY EARHARDT IS OUTSIDE

23
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:45,850
THE PALACE IN HELSINKI.

24
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:47,618
NIGEL, LET'S START WITH YOU.

25
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:51,622
TO HAPPEN VERY SHORTLY, THE

26
00:00:51,623 --> 00:00:52,690
PRESIDENT'S SUMMIT IS THAT

27
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:53,991
THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF

28
00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:54,692
DEMOCRATS HERE IN THE UNITED

29
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,730
SPIES WERE INDICTED FOR

30
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:01,131
MEDDLING IN OUR ELECTION,

31
00:01:01,132 --> 00:01:03,434
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE THE

32
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:05,436
SUMMIT.

33
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:11,175
BEEN FOUND SPYING.

34
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:13,944
WE DO IT TO THEM.

35
00:01:13,945 --> 00:01:15,813
IT MAY NOT BE VERY SEEMLY,

36
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:17,147
BUT IT'S HOW THE WORLD

37
00:01:17,148 --> 00:01:17,448
WORKS.

38
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:18,148
THERE IS NOTHING IN THAT

39
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:19,750
OTHER THAN A VERY STRANGE

40
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:20,784
COINCIDENCE OF TIMING.

41
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:27,157
TEST IS ASK SOMEBODY, DO YOU

42
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:29,193
WANT BETTER RELATIONS

43
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:33,163
CONTINUAL TO DETERIORATE?

44
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:34,164
AND ANYBODY WITH HALF A

45
00:01:34,165 --> 00:01:35,366
BRAIN WILL SAY DO YOU KNOW

46
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:35,666
WHAT?

47
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:39,136
TALKING IS BETTER THAN NOT

48
00:01:39,137 --> 00:01:39,536
TALKING.

49
00:01:39,537 --> 00:01:40,337
ABBY: NIGEL, I KNOW YOU WERE

50
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:41,605
WITH THE PRESIDENT A FEW

51
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:42,139
DAYS AGO.

52
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,307
TALKING TO HIM, WHAT IS

53
00:01:43,308 --> 00:01:44,308
DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS MEETING

54
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:45,743
BECAUSE PUTIN HAS MET WITH

55
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:47,945
OUR PRESIDENTS IN THE PAST

56
00:01:47,946 --> 00:01:49,780
THEY HAVE ALL PRESSED THIS

57
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:51,482
RESET BUTTON, SAYING THINGS

58
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:52,683
ARE GOING TO GET BETTER.

59
00:01:52,684 --> 00:01:53,617
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS GOING TO

60
00:01:54,753 --> 00:01:55,986
DIFFERENT BETWEEN THESE TWO

61
00:01:55,987 --> 00:01:56,620
MEETINGS TODAY.

62
00:01:56,621 --> 00:01:58,188
>> THE FACT IS THE PREVIOUS

63
00:01:58,189 --> 00:01:58,923
MEETINGS HAVE HAPPENED

64
00:01:58,924 --> 00:02:00,257
AROUND THE BACK OF GLOBAL

65
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:00,591
SUMMITS.

66
00:02:00,592 --> 00:02:01,792
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY

67
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:04,428
HAVE SAT DOWN SPECIFICALLY

68
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:05,195
TO WORK OUT WHERE THIS

69
00:02:05,196 --> 00:02:07,398
RELATIONSHIP IS GOING.

70
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:08,332
IT IS IMPORTANT.

71
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,967
THERE ARE QUESTIONS, CLEARLY

72
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:10,767
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS TO

73
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:11,468
ASK OF PUTIN.

74
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:17,374
YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP

75
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,676
SAYS LOOK, IF YOU EVER HAVE

76
00:02:18,677 --> 00:02:20,344
OR YOU EVER INTEND TO MEDDLE

77
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,451
BUT, MAYBE MAYBE WE CAN

78
00:02:27,452 --> 00:02:28,752
START TO HAVE A MORE

79
00:02:28,753 --> 00:02:29,420
SENSIBLE RELATIONSHIP.

80
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:30,421
AT THE MOMENT WHAT WE HAVE

81
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:31,956
GOT IS WE HAVE GOT THE

82
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:43,100
ESTABLISHMENT BLAMING

83
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:43,968
WITHOUT AN ANSWERS.

84
00:02:47,672 --> 00:02:49,273
BRIAN: GO AHEAD, AINSLEY.

85
00:02:49,274 --> 00:02:50,975
AINSLEY: THANK YOU, BRIAN.

86
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:53,143
IS THERE ANY CHANCE THOSE 12

87
00:02:53,144 --> 00:02:54,178
INDICTED WILL BE EXTRADITED

88
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:55,412
BACK TO AMERICA SO WE CAN

89
00:02:55,413 --> 00:03:00,684
SEND THEM THROUGH THE COURT

90
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:08,592
THAT WOULD BE A GESTURE OF

91
00:03:08,593 --> 00:03:09,994
GOODWILL ON PUTIN'S PART.

92
00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:11,295
I'M NOT SURE HIS PERSONALITY

93
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:13,397
IS QUITE MADE THAT WAY.

94
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:18,102
BRIAN: UNCONSTITUTIONAL FOR

95
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:19,203
EXTRADITE FOR ANOTHER

96
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:19,536
COUNTRY.

97
00:03:19,537 --> 00:03:20,504
VLADIMIR PUTIN CAN'T DO IT

98
00:03:20,505 --> 00:03:21,271
IF HE WANTED.

99
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:22,272
TO SAY WHAT DO YOU SAY TO

100
00:03:22,273 --> 00:03:23,741
PEOPLE WHO SAY THE RUSSIANS

101
00:03:23,742 --> 00:03:25,376
HACKED BREXIT AND THEY

102
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:26,944
HACKED U.S. ELECTIONS AND

103
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:27,878
WON ON BOTH ENDS?

104
00:03:33,718 --> 00:03:34,918
AND NOBODY THOUGHT TRUMP

105
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,886
WOULD HAPPEN.

106
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:36,520
THE ESTABLISHMENT WHO

107
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:37,888
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY

108
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:38,856
MIDDLE ENGLAND AND MIDDLE

109
00:03:38,857 --> 00:03:40,624
AMERICA VOTED IN A WAY THAT

110
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:41,892
THEY CAN'T COMPREHEND.

111
00:03:41,893 --> 00:03:42,893
THEY ARE DESPERATELY LOOKING

112
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:43,927
FOR AN EXCUSE.

113
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:46,497
CONSPIRACY THEORY.

114
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:48,432
I HAVE BEEN ACCUSED

115
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:49,500
ENDLESSLY BY THE GUARDIAN OF

116
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:56,807
WORKING WITH THE RUSSIANS.

117
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:57,107
VODKA.

118
00:03:57,108 --> 00:03:57,541
LUDICROUS.

119
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:58,208
STEVE: THE NEWS YESTERDAY

120
00:03:58,209 --> 00:03:59,510
WAS THAT THERESA MAY, THE

121
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:00,444
PRIME MINISTER, SAID WHEN

122
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:01,245
SHE SAT DOWN WITH THE

123
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:03,881
PRESIDENT THE PRESIDENT SAID

124
00:04:03,882 --> 00:04:05,282
SUE THE EU.

125
00:04:05,283 --> 00:04:10,454
WAS THAT ADVICE FROM YOU.

126
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:10,821
[LAUGHTER]

127
00:04:10,822 --> 00:04:12,189
>> ALL I CAN SAY OF THIS,

128
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:18,128
UNDERSTANDS NEGOTIATIONS.

129
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:20,330
AND HE UNDERSTOOD THAT WE

130
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:22,466
HAD PAID HUNDREDS OF

131
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:24,768
MILLIONS OF POUNDS INTO AN

132
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:26,503
ORGANIZATION EVERY SINGLE

133
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:27,738
YEAR, YOU KNOW, TENS OF

134
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:30,340
BILLIONS OVER THE LAST

135
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:32,142
DECADE, TO AN ORGANIZATION

136
00:04:38,183 --> 00:04:42,920
NEGOTIATIONS BEING TOUGH I

137
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:44,955
DON'T TAKE CREDIT FOR IT THE

138
00:04:49,694 --> 00:04:50,727
>> THERE THE PRESIDENT TALKS

139
00:04:50,728 --> 00:00:00,000
TO ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE.
