FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISOR HAS BEEN SUCKED INTO ALL OF THIS. SAT DOWN WITH MUELLER INVESTIGATORS AND HE JOINS US TONIGHT. MICHAEL, YOU SAID RECENTLY IN ANOTHER VIEW YOU BECAME AWARE WHEN YOU WERE WORKING ON THE CAMPAIGN DURING 2016 OF ANOTHER POTENTIAL SPY WORKING ON BEHALF OF INTEL OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CONTROLLED BY OBAMA. TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT. I HAVE DISCUSSED PUBLICLY THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS EARLY MAY APPROACH TO ME BY A FORMER GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY ARENA WHO THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY TRIED TO GET TO ME AND TELL ME THAT THE NSA HAD HILLARY CLINTON'S EMAILS AND THAT WE COULD GET AHOLD OF THEM IF WE WANTED THEM. AND THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUED FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND I EVENTUALLY TOLD THEM I HAD NO INTEREST BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE CLASSIFIED MATERIAL AS A FORMER ARMY VETERAN WHO HELD A TOP SECRET CLEARANCE I KNEW THAT WAS FRAUGHT WITH PERIL. Tucker: YOU BELIEVE THAT WAS A TRAP TO LURE YOU IN TO COMPROMISING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN SOME WAY. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, TUCKER, FOR TWO YEARS I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT AS. I GAVE IT TO THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND THE MUELLER INVESTIGATORS WHEN I SAT WITH THEM TWO WEEKS AGO OR THREE WEEKS AGO. AND THEY DIDN'T SEEM THE LEAST BIT INTERESTED. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF IT. TWO YEARS I SCRATCHED MY HEAD. THE INTERMEDIARY OLD FRIEND OF MINE. WE TALKED ABOUT IT OVER DINNER DOZENS OF TIMES. WE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WAS. THEN THE NEWS CAME OUT ABOUT THE SPY LATCHING ON TO MEMBERS MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN POLICY COMMITTEE. A LIGHT BULB CAME ON IN MY HEAD. IF THIS WASN'T A DANGLE OF SOME SORT FROM WHATEVER FBI, WHATEVER THIS WAS STRAKE ENOUGH WHERE YOU NEEDED TO BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC. I KNEW THE INVESTIGATORS WEREN'TED WEREN'T INTERESTED IN IT. THEY AT THIS POINT IN TIME TAKE NOTES WHEN I TOLD THEM ABOUT IT. Tucker: MAY I STOP YOU THERE REALLY QUICK? I'M CONFUSED BY THAT. THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO THE HEART OF THE TOPIC THAT MUELLER IS PURPORTEDLY INVESTIGATING. RIGHT. Tucker: CONSUMING ALL THIS MONEY AND ATTENTION INVESTIGATING. WHY WOULD THEY NOT BE INTERESTED IN HEARING MORE ABOUT THAT? RIGHT. IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAD HILLARY'S EMAILS IN EARLY MAY WHEN THIS GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR WAS TELL US WE COULD GET THEM WHY AREN'T THEY INTERESTED. I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU THAT'S WHAT SET OFF A RED FLAG FOR ME. THEY DIDN'T SEEM THE LEAST BIT INTERESTED AT ALL. THEY DIDN'T EVEN TAKE NOTES. I OFFERED THEM THE TIME LINE I WAS READING FROM IN MY VIEW AND THEY DIDN'T TAKE IT. Tucker: THAT'S ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE. WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING YOUR PERSONAL STORY FOR A NUMBER OF MONTHS NOW. AND YOU GOT SUCKED INTO THIS, I THINK, AND IT'S TURNED YOUR LIFE UPSIDE DOWN. DO YOU EXPECT TO HAVE MORE CONTACT WITH MUELLER'S INVESTIGATORS? I BROUGHT THIS TO THE PUBLIC JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. THERE IS ANOTHER APPROACH TO ME THAT WAS CON IN LATE MAY OR THE LAST HALF OF MAY BYSON WHO BYSOMEWHO BYSOMEBOO BYSOMEBODY I BELIEVE WAS ORGANIZED BY THE INVESTIGATORS. I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT ON TELEVISION BECAUSE THE MUELLER TEAM WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT SO MUCH SO MUCH THAT THEY SOUNDED LIKE THE AUTHORS OF IT. I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THAT WITH THE DOJ OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL. NOW THAT THAT I KNOW THEY ARE RESPONDING TO THE PRESIDENT POSITIVELY AND LOOKING INTO THESE DANGLES IN FRONT OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, I WANT TOE TALK ABOUT BOTH IBOUT BOTH I WUT BOTH I WAN BOTH I WANT OTH I WANT TOH I WANT TO TALKABOUT BOTH OF THE. ONE I TALKED ABOUT IN PUBLIC THE FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR WHO CAME TO ME THROUGH INTERMEDIARY IN THE FIRST WEEK OF MAY AND THIS OTHER APPROACH THAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST HALF OF MAY. MY ATTORNEY IS WRITING A LETTER TO THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL ASKING TO BE INVITED TO TESTIFY ON THIS. Tucker: I HOPE YOU WILL BE. BECAUSE, UNLIKE MUELLER'S INVESTIGATORS, I AM INTERESTED. MICHAEL, THANK YOU. GREAT TO SEE YOU. I WILL TELL YOU, TUCKER, YOU SEE THESE FBI AGENTS THAT WANT TO GO IN AS WELL. THEY ARE ASKING FOR SUBPOENAS SO THEY CAN GO AND TALK TO THE IG ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW SITTING IN THE OFFICE AT THE FBI. THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE LYING AGENTS AT THE FBI WHO WANT TO TALK. I WANT THEM TO KNOW IF THEY ARE WATCHING THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR A SUBPOENA, I KNOW THOSE LEGAL FEES ARE REALLY EXPENSIVE. OUR LEGAL FUND AT CAPUTO LEGAL FEE.COM WILL PAY THEIR LEGAL FEES. GO TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND SAY WHAT HAPPENED. WE WILL PAY THEIR LEGAL
