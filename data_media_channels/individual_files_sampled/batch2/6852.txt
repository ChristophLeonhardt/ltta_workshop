so we have a quick update from a story from yesterday you may remember hearing about representative Tim Murphy he is the embattled anti-abortion abortion lawmaker who allegedly encouraged his mistress to terminate her own pregnancy he had said that he was going to resign from office or retire after 2018 well now it has come out that he is actually going to resign at the end of this month from Paul Ryan this afternoon I received a letter of resignation from congressman Tim Murphy effective October 21st speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement it was dr. Murphy's decision to move on to the next chapter of his life and I support it so I guess no big shocker here were you guys surprised when you heard that this was news today um I was I guess I was a little surprised because we're in this like new world of Republican lawmakers doing things that are so deeply hypocritical and embarrassing and then not apologizing for it like doubling down on had no consequence and no consequences so I was like oh whoa he's gonna you know he's gonna step down that's actually pretty amazing and I'm glad that he is and he should yeah I think it's straightforward he should I agree that we're in an age where it's like oh we kind of legislate morality and we kind of do immoral things and there are no consequences for it I think because it was so glaring and I think Paul Ryan even you know he says that it was his own decision to step down but I feel like you know we know that a couple of congressmen went to see him like you got to leave yeah you know like I supported it was basically been like an I urged it right yeah yeah you gotta get the hell out of here yes a quick update for you guys qit membership gets your commercial-free young turks downloaded streaming podcasts that get all the network shows and support independent media TYT Network comm /join
