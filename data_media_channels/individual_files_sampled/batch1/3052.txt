love to well love to and there's been a lot of talks about it obviously I have a great partnership with Warner Brothers and they definitely were the ones who brought the Space Jam one which is which is incredible I think Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes they did an unbelievable thing for not only for my childhood but so many kids and so many people who followed that franchise so you know obviously we want to make sure that is right we don't want to rush it we don't want to do something that's not authentic to the Space Jam branch so hopefully we can get it right but they you know right now we're stands you know the Space Jam franchise is in great place
