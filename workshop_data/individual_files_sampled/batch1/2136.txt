the Business Insider is hereby calling for the immediate resignation of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner why five reasons we'll walk through them one Tim Geithner is directly responsible for the most appalling corporate bailout in the United States history AIG last fall received tens of billions of dollars directly from the taxpayer the money was funneled through AIG to dozens of corporations that are now proclaiming that they never needed the money they never needed it they'd never should have gotten it now we know from the emails we've seen the new york fed in fact took steps to conceal this fact from the united states public whose money it was Tim Geithner should be held responsible for the AIG bailout as we've long believed number two Tim Geithner's policy and reason for saving the banks and always putting Wall Street first has been that we have to so the bank's can continue to lend that policy is now officially a failure banks are not lending they are hoarding cash they are also buying Treasuries so effectively their lending money to the government but that's not the reason we saved them the Fed can print its own money it doesn't need it from the banks banks are not lending so the reason for putting Wall Street first has now been eliminated and proved wrong number three Tim Geithner's policy too big to fail has now ensured that a big segment of our economy the big wall street banks effectively have a government guarantee this has basically been written into the Constitution at this point it's creating havoc throughout the economy starting with the fact that Wall Street now has a guarantee roll the dice taxpayers lose no matter what you can win we'll pick up the body the downside that is just simply a ludicrous policy we are sticking with it there has been some noise that we maybe have to change this at some point but it is not happening now the government comes out basically says we will save anybody that is a tim geithner policy he has to take responsibility for it or Tim Geithner's decision both this Treasury secretary but then also at AIG have fueled an incredible populists outrage and the problem with this is that even if it doesn't lead to revolution something like that is it is totally tying the government's hands for future actions god forbid we get into trouble again with the banks the government will be able to do nothing in part because of bailouts like AIG and the way they were handled in terms of this cloak of secrecy again Tim Geithner is directly responsible for AIG and certainly for too big to fail and in large part for this populists outrage lastly and perhaps most importantly to a lot of people who support President Obama Tim Geithner is dragging down Obama he is hurting his ability to enact his agenda make policy hurting his influence on AIG specifically President Obama had absolutely nothing to do with AIG yet it is still in the headlines we continue to get news about it Tim Geithner meanwhile was directly responsible again should step down to preserve his boss now we want to stress is not personal Tim Geithner from everyone we talked to the ministration who has interacted with him is a very good guy we have no doubt that he acted at doing what he thought was best for the country but the rationale all the way along has been we had to do this or the world would have ended that's not good enough first it's debatable but second is just not good enough and it does not rinse his hands of responsibility for the decisions he made so again we stress our call at the Business Insider for the resignation of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner
