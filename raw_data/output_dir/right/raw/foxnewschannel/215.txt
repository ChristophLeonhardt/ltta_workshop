00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,373

UNLESS TRUMP REVEALING HER

HIDDEN MESS IMAGINE HER FIRST

9
00:00:26,218 --> 00:00:27,585
EXTENSIVE SIT-DOWN SINCE

10
00:00:27,586 --> 00:00:29,053
BECOMING FIRST LADY.

11
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:31,055
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE JACKET.

12
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:32,089
WHY DID YOU WEAR IT?

13
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,458
>> I WORE THE JACKET TO GO ON

14
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:36,894
THE PLANE AND OFF THE PLANE, AND

15
00:00:36,895 --> 00:00:39,096
IT WAS FOR THE PEOPLE OF AND FOR

16
00:00:39,097 --> 00:00:42,700
THE LEFT-WING MEDIA WHO ARE

17
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:44,268
CRITICIZING ME, AND I WANT TO

18
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:45,903
SHOW THEM, I DON'T CARE.

19
00:00:45,904 --> 00:00:47,672
YOU CAN CRITICIZE WHATEVER YOU

20
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:48,372
WANT TO SAY.

21
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:50,841
IT WILL NOT STOP ME TO DO WHAT I

22
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:51,742
FEEL IS RIGHT.

23
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:54,211
>> YOU WERE SENDING A MESSAGE

24
00:00:54,212 --> 00:00:55,613

25
00:00:55,614 --> 00:00:57,715
>> IT WAS KINDS AFTER MESSAGE,

26
00:00:57,716 --> 00:00:58,349
YES.

27
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,451
I WOULD PREFER THEY FOCUS ON

28
00:01:00,452 --> 00:01:02,920
WHAT I DO AND MY INITIATIVE THAN

29
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:06,524
WHAT I WEAR.

30
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:10,761
JESSE: JOINING ME, DIAMOND AND

31
00:01:10,762 --> 00:01:11,062
SILK.

32
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:12,196
IRONICALLY WE ARE FOCUSING ON

33
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,700
WHAT SHE IS TBHEARG PLAYING THE

34
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,801
SOUND

35
00:01:16,802 --> 00:01:16,834
THUND

36
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:16,867
THE D

37
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,203
THE -- THE SOUND BITE.

38
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,772
>> I THINK SHE GAVE A GREAT

39
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:23,874
EXPLANATION AND SHE DID A

40
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,444
PHENOMENAL JOB IGNORING THE

41
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:28,312
BIASED INNUENDOS FROM THE

42
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:29,380
REPORTER.

43
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:33,217
THEY WERE TRYING TO GO OFF

44
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,885
SALACIOUS GOSSIP TO GET A

45
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,820
REACTION OUT OF HER.

46
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:38,689
THE LEFT-WING MEDIA TREAT HER

47
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,791
HORRIBLY, WHICH IS SO SAD.

48
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:43,027
I THINK THEY NEED TO GIVE HER

49
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:44,662
CREDIT AND START TREATING HER

50
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:46,530
LIKE OUR FIRST LADY.

51
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:48,232
WE LOVE HER.

52
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,568
AND THEY NEED TO TREAT HER WITH

53
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,571
THE UTMOST RESPECT.

54
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,239
JESSE: I DON'T WEAR ANYTHING

55
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,574
CONTROVERSIAL SO THEY CAN'T GO

56
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,408
AFTER ME.

57
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,710
SO KANYE WEST GOT POLITICAL AS

58
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:01,145

59
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:03,481
TAYLOR SWIFT GOT PRETTY

60
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:06,417
POLITICAL ENDORSING A SENATE

61
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,019
CANDIDATE, DEMOCRAT IN

62
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,487
TENNESSEE, AND IT HAPPENED

63
00:02:09,488 --> 00:02:11,622
WITHIN THE SAME WEEK.

64
00:02:11,623 --> 00:02:17,528
BUT KANYE IS SAVAGELY ATTACKED,

65
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:21,499

66
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,034
THAT'S SO SWEET THAT SHE IS

67
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:25,469
GETTING INVOLVED IN THE

68
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,104
POLITICAL PROCESS.

69
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:31,742
SOMEWHAT THEY ARE DOING TO KANYE

70
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:34,545

71
00:02:34,546 --> 00:02:36,814

JESSE: THIS HAS ME FIRED UP.

00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:57,134
THIS IS JUST ASTOUNDING TO.

78
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:57,935
"WATTERS' WORLD."

79
00:02:57,936 --> 00:03:00,137
THERE IS A POLL AND IT WAS DONE

80
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,339
BY A GROUPED CALLED I THINK IT

81
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,774

82
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:06,243
THIS IS WAIT SAID.

83
00:03:06,244 --> 00:03:09,914
80% OF AMERICANS THINK POLITICAL

84
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:11,215

85
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:11,916

HISPANICS, ASIANS,

92
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:26,731
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

93
00:03:26,732 --> 00:03:30,501
PRETTY MUCH' THE ENTIRE COUNTRY

94
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,669

95
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,505
THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING WITH.

96
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,006

COUNTRY.

105
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,956
WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOCIAL MEDIA

106
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:53,691
AND UNIVERSITIES AND SCHOOLS.

107
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:58,629
