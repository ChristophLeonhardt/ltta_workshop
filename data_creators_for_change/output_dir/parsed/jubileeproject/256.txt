Hello, I’m Benedict and I’m the president of the American
Society for Deaf Children (ASDC).
At ASDC, we want to thank everyone who was involved
in this project.
We’d like to thank The Jubilee Project for producing this film and
all of you out there who viewed it.
Can you imagine that there are over 168,000 views
of that video?
And we also want to thank all of our sponsors. If not for all of you, we would have no money.
So we’ve collected probably over $2,500. We will use that money
for many different things.
Our mission is to spread awareness about American Sign Language.
Our belief is that children have linguistic rights.
Sign language, then, if they want
to add different communication methods, that’s fine.
We also have every two years a conference
for families who have deaf and hard of hearing children
So that’s what we do. Basically, we’re a volunteer organization
so many thanks!
