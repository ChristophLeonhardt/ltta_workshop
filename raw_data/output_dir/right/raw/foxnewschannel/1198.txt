1
00:00:01,804 --> 00:00:04,173
>> BAKER AND FOR MY RELIGIOUS

2
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:05,341
CONSERVATIVES AROUND THE

3
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:05,675
COUNTRY.

4
00:00:05,675 --> 00:00:05,975
NEIL?

5
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:08,077
>> Neil: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

6
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:09,679
NOW, RIGHT AFTER THIS BROUHAHA

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,148
JUST STARTED IN 2015, I HAD A

8
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:14,117
CHANCE TO CATCH UP WITH THE

9
00:00:14,117 --> 00:00:16,119
BAKER IN QUESTION, JACK PHILLIPS

10
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:17,654
THAT WOULD PROMPT THIS COURT

11
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:18,755
DECISION TODAY.

12
00:00:18,755 --> 00:00:20,423
HE WAS ARGUING ON RELIGIOUS

13
00:00:20,423 --> 00:00:22,158
GROUNDS AND MORE THAT HE JUST

14
00:00:22,158 --> 00:00:23,226
WANTED TO DO WHAT HE SAID THE

15
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:25,428
LORD WAS TELLING HIM TO DO.

16
00:00:25,428 --> 00:00:27,931
TAKE A LOOK.

17
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:29,399
>> WHEN YOU HEARD THE SUPREME

18
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,567
COURT RULED AND TO YOUR LAWYER'S

19
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:34,304
POINT, THE 5-4 DECISION IN FAVOR

20
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,072
OF GAY MARRIAGE IS APPARENTLY

21
00:00:36,072 --> 00:00:37,674
DEEPLY RELIGIOUS MAN, HOW DID

22
00:00:37,674 --> 00:00:38,308
YOU FEEL?

23
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:40,376
>> I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE

24
00:00:40,376 --> 00:00:41,878
COURT'S DECISION BUT STILL IT'S

25
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:43,513
A DIFFERENT DECISION THAN WHAT

26
00:00:43,513 --> 00:00:44,547
MY CASE IS.

27
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:46,349
MY CASE IS THE GOVERNMENT IS

28
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:49,385
TRYING TO FORCE ME TO VIOLATE MY

29
00:00:49,385 --> 00:00:51,387
PERSONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM

30
00:00:51,387 --> 00:00:52,755
CREATE CAKE.

31
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:53,856
CREATE A CAKE FOR A CEREMONY

32
00:00:53,856 --> 00:00:56,893
THAT I HAVE OBJECTIONS TO.

33
00:00:56,893 --> 00:00:58,227
>> Neil: LET'S SAY YOU LOSE THIS

34
00:00:58,227 --> 00:01:00,897
CASE ON APPEAL.

35
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:04,266
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS, A

36
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:05,768
HOMOSEXUAL COUPLE COMES IN AND

37
00:01:05,768 --> 00:01:07,604
YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE FOR THEM, NO

38
00:01:07,604 --> 00:01:08,004
DIFFERENCE.

39
00:01:08,004 --> 00:01:08,504
WHAT DO YOU DO?

40
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:09,572
>> THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE.

41
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:12,809
I TREAT ALL OF MY CUSTOMERS THE

42
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:13,109
SAME.

43
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,810
>> Neil: I UNDERSTAND THAT.

44
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,746
YOU WON'T MAKE A CAKE FOR A GAY

45
00:01:16,746 --> 00:01:17,246
WEDDING, CORRECT?

46
00:01:17,246 --> 00:01:19,182
YOU WILL FOR A HETEROSEXUAL ONE?

47
00:01:19,182 --> 00:01:20,984
>> RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT MAKING

48
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:21,918
ANY WEDDING CAKES.

49
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:24,153
THAT'S TAKEN A GOOD CHUNK OF MY

50
00:01:24,153 --> 00:01:24,821
BUSINESS AWAY.

51
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:25,455
>> ALL RIGHT.

52
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:27,490
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR, AT THE TIME

53
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,392
BECAUSE THERE WAS THE DUST UP

54
00:01:29,392 --> 00:01:31,494
OVER MAKING A CAKE FOR A SAME

55
00:01:31,494 --> 00:01:33,062
SEX COUPLE, HE JUST STOPPED, THE

56
00:01:33,062 --> 00:01:36,232
BAKER IN QUESTION, FROM DOING

57
00:01:36,232 --> 00:01:38,901
CAKES FOR ANYONE, HETEROSEXUAL

58
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:39,235
COUPLES.

59
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:41,037
ALL OF THAT STOPPED TODAY OR HE

60
00:01:41,037 --> 00:01:43,106
CAN RETURN TO MAKING CAKES FOR

61
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:45,308
ANYONE TODAY, MOST LIKELY

62
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:45,875
HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES.

63
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,944
TO THE ATTORNEY THAT ARGUED THIS

64
00:01:47,944 --> 00:01:50,313
CASE AMONG THE WINNING TEAM

65
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:51,447
BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT,

66
00:01:51,447 --> 00:01:53,116
JEREMY, GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.

67
00:01:53,116 --> 00:01:54,150
>> THANKS, NEIL.

68
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,085
>> Neil: HOW WAS THIS DECIDED

69
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:58,154
AND HOW DID TWO LIBERAL JUSTICES

70
00:01:58,154 --> 00:01:59,522
GO ALONG?

71
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:00,990
ON WHAT GROUNDS?

72
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,626
>> WELL, THE COURT BASICALLY

73
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:05,361
SAID LOOK, GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T

74
00:02:05,361 --> 00:02:07,597
BE HOSTILE TO PEOPLE ON THE

75
00:02:07,597 --> 00:02:10,265
BASIS OF THEIR RELIGIOUS

76
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:10,633
BELIEFS.

77
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:12,769
THAT HOSTILE HAS NO PLACE IN OUR

78
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:13,136
SOCIETY.

79
00:02:13,136 --> 00:02:14,604
ONE OF THE COMMISSIONERS IN THE

80
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:16,673
CASE AND THIS IS WHAT CAUGHT THE

81
00:02:16,673 --> 00:02:17,907
ATTENTION OF THE COURT,

82
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:19,142
CERTAINLY DID OF JUSTICE

83
00:02:19,142 --> 00:02:21,144
KENNEDY, SAID AT ONE OF THE

84
00:02:21,144 --> 00:02:26,649
HEARINGS IN JACK'S CASE THAT SHE

85
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:30,486
FOUND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM TO BE

86
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:30,853
RHETORIC.

87
00:02:30,853 --> 00:02:33,456
JUSTICE KENNEDY ARGUED THAT.

88
00:02:33,456 --> 00:02:35,158
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE HOSTILE

89
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:36,225
TO PEOPLE OF FAITH.

90
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:38,061
THEY SHOULDN'T PUSH PEOPLE OUT

91
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:39,262
OF THE MARKETPLACE BECAUSE OF

92
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:40,897
THEIR RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS

93
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:41,698
ABOUT MARRIAGE.

94
00:02:41,698 --> 00:02:43,833
THAT GARNERED SEVEN VOTES IN

95
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,601
FAVOR OF JACK PHILLIPS.

96
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:47,537
I HEARD YOU QUESTION WHERE YOU

97
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:49,205
ASK HIM WHAT IF YOU LOSE?

98
00:02:49,205 --> 00:02:50,973
SO GLAD WE DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER

99
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:51,541
THAT QUESTION.

100
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,110
JACK PHILLIPS WON AND HE WON IN

101
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,179
A WAY THAT RE-AFFIRMS THE IDEA

102
00:02:56,179 --> 00:02:57,580
THAT GOVERNMENT HAS NO BUSINESS

103
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,414
TARGETING PEOPLE BECAUSE OF

104
00:02:58,414 --> 00:02:59,916
THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.

105
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:00,717
>> Neil: THEY STILL DID GO OUT

106
00:03:00,717 --> 00:03:02,852
OF THE WAY, THE JUSTICES,

107
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:05,855
ESPECIALLY ANTHONY KENNEDY'S

108
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:07,924
RULING, TO NOT INTERPRET THIS

109
00:03:07,924 --> 00:03:09,559
MORE BROADLY THAN WAS THE CASE.

110
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:11,627
THIS WAS ISOLATED AND NOT A

111
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:12,261
PRECEDENT SETTER.

112
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:14,464
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT?

113
00:03:14,464 --> 00:03:20,436
>> YOU CAN'T SAY THAT JUSTICE

114
00:03:20,436 --> 00:03:22,538
KENNEDY SAYS IT ONLY APPLIES TO

115
00:03:22,538 --> 00:03:23,473
JACK PHILLIPS.

116
00:03:23,473 --> 00:03:25,975
THERE'S OTHER CASES THAT WILL

117
00:03:25,975 --> 00:03:27,410
HAVE THE FREE SPEECH ISSUE.

118
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,112
THAT WILL RESERVE FOR ANOTHER

119
00:03:29,112 --> 00:03:29,378
DAY.

120
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:31,481
MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS IS AN

121
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:32,281
IMPORTANT RULING.

122
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:34,150
IT RE-AFFIRMS THE PRINCIPLE THAT

123
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,318
GOVERNMENT HOSTILITY HAS NO

124
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:36,986
PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY.

125
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:38,688
IT ALSO TALKED ABOUT UNEQUAL

126
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:40,123
APPLICATION OF THE LAW, WHERE

127
00:03:40,123 --> 00:03:41,858
THE GOVERNMENT FAVORS SOME VIEWS

128
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:42,725
OVER OTHERS.

129
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:44,861
THAT HAPPENED IN THIS CASE, TOO.

130
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:46,996
THREE COLORADO BAKERIES WERE

131
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:49,098
ASKED TO CREATE CAKES OPPOSING

132
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:49,766
SAME SEX MARRIAGE.

133
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:51,200
THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T WANT TO

134
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,136
CREATE THEM BECAUSE THEY

135
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:54,270
SUPPORTED SAME SEX MARRIAGE AND

136
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,172
THE COLORADO CIVIL RIGHTS

137
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:59,375
COMMISSION, WHEN THEY RECEIVED

138
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,811
THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE

139
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:03,846
SITUATION SAID YOU'RE

140
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:06,048
EXONERATED.

141
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:06,499
YET THEY'RE PROSECUTES

142
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:06,616
YET THEY'RE PROSECUTE

143
00:04:06,616 --> 00:04:06,649
YET THEY'RE PROSECUTIN

144
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:07,750
YET THEY'RE PROSECUTING

145
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,784
YET THEY'RE PROSECUTING J

146
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:07,817
YET THEY'RE PROSECUTING JAC

147
00:04:07,817 --> 00:04:08,050
YET THEY'RE PROSECUTING JACK

148
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,152
PHILLIPS TO THE FULLEST EXTEND

149
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:10,720
OF THE LAW.

150
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,322
HE OPPOSES SAME SEX MARRIAGE.

151
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:15,591
THERE HAS TO BE AN EVEN PLAYING

152
00:04:15,591 --> 00:04:16,425
FIELD FOR FREE SPEECH.

153
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:17,860
THAT'S THE IDEA OF THE FIRST

154
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,528
AMENDMENT.

155
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:20,663
THERE'S NOT JUST THE RELIGIOUS

156
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:21,564
HOSTILITY THAT PLAYED A PART IN

157
00:04:21,564 --> 00:04:22,298
THE RULING.

158
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:24,667
IT'S THE FACT THAT THE STATE OF

159
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:26,702
COLORADO IS UNEVENLY APPLYING

160
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:29,005
ITS LAW FAVORING SOME VIEWS,

161
00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:30,740
THOSE THAT SUPPORT SAME SEX

162
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,508
MARRIAGE OR THOSE THAT OPPOSE

163
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:33,709
SAME SEX MARRIAGE.

164
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,678
THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO BUSINESS

165
00:04:35,678 --> 00:04:38,314
PLAYING THOSE FAVORITES IN THE

166
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:39,582
FREE SPEECH CONTACT.

167
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:41,284
>> Neil: I'M NOT SO SURE IT'S

168
00:04:41,284 --> 00:04:42,518
THAT BLACK AND WHITE.

169
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:44,554
I KNOW IT WAS BALANCING THE

170
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:46,355
RESPECT FOR SINCERE RELIGIOUS

171
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:48,357
BELIEFS VERSUS PRACTICES THAT

172
00:04:48,357 --> 00:04:50,226
COULD TARGET PERSONS WITH

173
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:53,996
FURTHER INDIGNITIES IN THE GAY

174
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:54,363
COMMUNITY.

175
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:56,399
SO IT'S THE EXACT SAME CASE WERE

176
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,335
TO BE BROUGHT UP IN A SEPARATE

177
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:00,636
SITUATION, IS IT A GIVEN THAT

178
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:02,939
THE JUSTICES WOULD RULE IN FAVOR

179
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:04,106
OF THE INDIVIDUAL?

180
00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:05,308
>> THERE CAN'T BE A GIVEN

181
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:06,475
BECAUSE THE COURT SAID WE

182
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:08,177
RESERVE THAT ISSUE FOR ANOTHER

183
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:08,444
DAY.

184
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:10,780
WHAT I'M SAYING IS, THE COURT'S

185
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,382
DECISION ISN'T AS NARROW AS SOME

186
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:15,117
PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU.

187
00:05:15,117 --> 00:05:17,253
THERE'S PLENTY OF PRINCIPLES IN

188
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:19,856
THAT DECISION THAT EXPAND FAR

189
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:20,423
BEYOND JACK PHILLIPS.

190
00:05:20,423 --> 00:05:21,724
THE PRINCIPLE OF THE GOVERNMENT

191
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:23,025
CAN'T BE HOSTILE TOO PEOPLE

192
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:24,794
BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGIOUS

193
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:25,127
BELIEFS.

194
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:26,329
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

195
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:27,897
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THAT

196
00:05:27,897 --> 00:05:29,498
REAFFIRMATION FROM THE COURT.

197
00:05:29,498 --> 00:05:30,566
>> Neil: HOW DO WE KNOW SOME

198
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:32,401
PEOPLE WON'T SEIZE ON THIS AND

199
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:34,036
SAY I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A CAKE

200
00:05:34,036 --> 00:05:35,471
FOR A MIXED MARRIAGE COUPLE?

201
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:38,307
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A CAKE FOR,

202
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:41,077
YOU KNOW A MIXED RELIGIOUS

203
00:05:41,077 --> 00:05:41,410
COUPLE?

204
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,746
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

205
00:05:43,746 --> 00:05:45,715
>> THE COURT SAID RACE IS

206
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:48,017
UNIQUE, IT'S DISTINCT, IT'S

207
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:48,384
SPECIAL.

208
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:49,418
RACE HAS NO PLACE FOR

209
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:50,753
DISCRIMINATION IN OUR SOCIETY.

210
00:05:50,753 --> 00:05:53,122
IN THE RACE CONTEXT, THAT WON'T

211
00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:54,056
BE TOLERATED.

212
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:55,157
THE JACK PHILLIPS CASE DOESN'T

213
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:57,827
CHANGE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE

214
00:05:57,827 --> 00:06:01,297
HYPOTHETICAL CASE THAT ARISES IN

215
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:03,399
THE RAISE CONTEXT.

216
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,433
IT'S NOT LIKE WE DIDN'T FACE

217
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:05,368
THAT ARGUMENT THROUGHOUT THE

218
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:05,668
CASE.

219
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:08,004
IT WAS IN THE OPPOSING BRIEFING,

220
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:09,906
IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE COURT.

221
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:12,141
THE COURT STILL RULED IN FAVOR

222
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:12,675
OF JACK PHILLIPS.

223
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:14,543
SO THAT ANALOGY DIDN'T CARRY

224
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:15,511
TODAY AND SHOULDN'T.

225
00:06:15,511 --> 00:06:16,545
BECAUSE RACE IS DIFFERENT.

226
00:06:16,545 --> 00:06:17,413
IT'S DISTINCT.

227
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:19,548
IT'S UNIQUE.

228
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:23,085
OUR SOCIETY HISTORICALLY AN

229
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:24,186
CONSTITUTIONALLY WANTS TO

230
00:06:24,186 --> 00:06:25,655
ERADICATE RACE DISCRIMINATION IS

231
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:28,324
A SPECIAL THING THAT IS

232
00:06:28,324 --> 00:06:29,759
PRESERVED FOR THAT ISSUE.

233
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,559
JACK PHILLIPS WINNING HIS CASE

234
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,862
IS NOT GOING TO UPSET THAT AT

235
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:33,763
ALL AND SHOULDN'T.

236
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:35,765
>> Neil: HAS MR. PHILLIPS TOLD

237
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:37,533
YOU WHAT HE INTENDS TO DO?

238
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:40,336
HE STOPPED MAKING CAKES PERIOD,

239
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:43,072
HOME SEXUAL OR HETEROSEXUAL.

240
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:45,408
WHETHER HE WOULD GET BACK IN THE

241
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:47,443
BUSINESS OF MAKING CAKES FOR THE

242
00:06:47,443 --> 00:06:48,044
HETEROSEXUAL COUPLE?

243
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:49,712
>> JACK NEEDS TO GET BACK IN THE

244
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:50,513
WEDDING CAKE INDUSTRY.

245
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:51,814
WHEN THIS RULING CAME DOWN FROM

246
00:06:51,814 --> 00:06:53,282
THE COMMISSION, HE HAD TO WALK

247
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:54,450
AWAY FROM THE WEDDING CAKE

248
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:54,817
INDUSTRY.

249
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:57,286
THAT WAS 40% OF HIS BUSINESS.

250
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:59,522
HE HAS SUFFERED FINANCIALLY AND

251
00:06:59,522 --> 00:06:59,922
EMOTIONALLY.

252
00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:02,024
THE TOLL THIS HAS TAKEN ON HIS

253
00:07:02,024 --> 00:07:03,659
FAMILY, THE DEATH THREATS, HE'S

254
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:04,026
WIFE.

255
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:05,761
HE'S TOLD ME STORY ABOUT HOW HIS

256
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:07,163
WIFE COUNTS BRING HERSELF TO

257
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:09,865
COME TO THE SHOP BECAUSE SHE WAS

258
00:07:09,865 --> 00:07:11,434
AFRAID FOR HER LIFE.

259
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:16,872
SO TO HAVE HIS SITUATION

260
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:18,674
VINDICATED BY THE COURT IS SO

261
00:07:18,674 --> 00:07:19,442
RELIEVING TO JACK.

262
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:20,810
HE WILL GET BACK IN THE

263
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,177
INDUSTRY.

264
00:07:21,177 --> 00:07:22,645
WE HAVE TO EVALUATE THIS

265
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:24,013
DECISION AND ADVISE HIM ON THE

266
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:25,915
BEST APPROACH TO DO THAT.

267
00:07:25,915 --> 00:07:27,516
WE'RE CONSIDERING ALL OF THOSE

268
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:28,451
OPTIONS RIGHT NOW.

269
00:07:28,451 --> 00:00:00,000
JACK HAS EVERY INTENTION OF
