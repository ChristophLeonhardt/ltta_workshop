1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
This is Andrea Constand,
the woman whose

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,590
sexual assault complaint
against Bill Cosby

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,800
brought down the man once
known as “America’s dad.”

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,710
“Finally, we can say:
Women are believed.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:17,710
And not only on #MeToo,
but in a court of law.”

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,370
She’s the only woman
among more than 50 others

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,280
whose case against Cosby
has resulted in a conviction.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,050
“I feel like my faith
in humanity is restored.”

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,950
Constand and Cosby’s story
started more than 15 years ago

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,430
in Philadelphia.

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,250
She was 29 years old
at the time, and worked

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,660
for the women’s basketball
team at Temple University.

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,340
Cosby was the university's most
famous alum and a trustee.

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,780
They met at a
basketball game in 2002.

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,180
Constand grew up
in Toronto, Canada.

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,514
She was a star high school
basketball player

17
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:52,000
and had dreams of
playing professionally.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,940
Over the next two years,

19
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,750
the pair had a
friendly relationship.

20
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,175
In 2004, Constand says
Cosby assaulted her

21
00:00:58,175 --> 00:00:59,775
at his Pennsylvania mansion

22
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:02,805
after giving her three
pills that left her frozen.

23
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:05,504
He claims the sex
was consensual.

24
00:01:05,504 --> 00:01:08,535
The pills, he later said,
were Benadryl.

25
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,355
Constand reported the attack
to the police a year later,

26
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:14,225
but prosecutors decided not
to charge Cosby at the time.

27
00:01:14,225 --> 00:01:16,165
She later filed
a civil suit

28
00:01:16,165 --> 00:01:18,695
and got a settlement
of over $3 million.

29
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,245
Cosby’s defense team
used that to paint her

30
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:24,115
her as a scheming
former lover.

31
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:28,645
“Andrea Constand made up
these fantastical stories

32
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:30,945
in order to get rich.”

33
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:34,325
A criminal investigation
was reopened in 2015.

34
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:37,635
“We’re here because
we want to seek the truth.”

35
00:01:37,635 --> 00:01:40,275
At this point, more than
50 women had come forward

36
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:42,615
with similar accusations
of sexual misconduct.

37
00:01:42,615 --> 00:01:44,165
Many of these
cases happened

38
00:01:44,165 --> 00:01:47,305
outside the 12-year
statute of limitations.

39
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:49,295
So Constand became
the lone accuser

40
00:01:49,295 --> 00:01:50,565
who brought
criminal charges.

41
00:01:50,565 --> 00:01:53,425
The jury came to their
decision in just two days.

42
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:56,285
“We don’t think Mr. Cosby
is guilty of anything.

43
00:01:56,285 --> 00:00:00,000
And the fight is not over.”
