alright here we go again Carter page foreign policy advisor to Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign FISA warrant out for him back in 2016 near the end of the election has now become public they did a Freedom of Information request to find out what was in that warrant a lot of it is redacted because that's where the red media is that's where all the different evidences for how he cooperated now who already cooperate with will they say he was a foreign agent and he cooperated and colluded with the government of Russia of course of course so there it's hundreds of pages long and the Republicans had said oh it's you know of course led by Donald Trump it's a witch hunt and I can't believe they got a warrant of someone who is in Donald Trump's campaign well they got a warrant because they had hundreds of pages of evidence that he was a foreign agent working for the Russian government they submitted it to a court the court looked at and said oh yeah go ahead and and wiretap them and do whatever you got to do because it is likely that he is a foreign agent working for the Russians while working on a presidential campaign now by the way it doesn't mean that Donald Trump knew about it it could be that he worked on that campaign and was a foreign agent unbeknownst to Donald Trump or others right and I'm not even saying that he's absolutely guilty that's why we have a justice system go through the process go to court and see what happens right but for the people saying that there's no evidence got hundreds of pages of evidence but the people say there's no connections to the Russians on the Donald Trump campaign preposterous not only of 26 Russia's already been arrested in the overall investigation and then you got Maria blue Tina who was the one Russian agent that we caught here and is in prison right now denied bail she apparently tried to get jobs with the Republicans by having sex with them because that probably would work and apparently worked well enough for her handlers in Russia to be thrilled with her work anyone claiming there's no evidence says I'm sorry it's just not true you're borderline these nearly lost your mind if you think hey it's not enough to start World War three of course I totally agree with you don't start any wars okay but we have to actually ascertain what happened and then finally to the insane right-wingers who say that the FBI is making all this stuff up and the special councils making it up so your thesis is this is a pic Carter page out of the blue they're like all right let's just pick oh let's do it maybe a little bingo or lottery or something oh look his Carter pages name came up among the different people on the Trump team during the campaign so let's take Carter page and let's make up all this evidence and claim that he's a foreign agent for Russia when there's actually none of that evidence they just make it all up and then let's go to the judge and say hey we're launching a conspiracy by the way this is before Donald Trump got elected so on the off chance that Donald Trump gets elected would you like to be part of this conspiracy where we're all in danger our careers by making up stuff that isn't true just at a whole cloth okay if you believe that you're not attached to the reality based world I have seen them manipulate intelligence a thousand times over most famously in the lead up to the Iraq war we were among the only shows in America that called it out the Young Turks were around back then and Ben and I were screaming when we were on the radio saying it's not true look at all the intelligence back then there was a lot of intelligence officials that were not getting covered on the front pages but we're getting attention on page a17 or with great outlets like McClatchy and Knight Ridder that we're saying no they're actually this is a real evidence and it's a mixed bag and we reported that back then okay and you could see Dick Cheney manipulating the evidence you could see him say absurd things like well Iraq is in the part of the region of the world that attacked us 50 99 from Saudi Arabia but you claim they're our top Ally when you're attacking Iraq which is this neighbor that makes no sense so I've I've seen this before and this isn't like that they have overwhelming evidence and there's no one in the intelligence community who disagrees and they're not all going to get together and make up a random line if the neo-cons have an agenda if certain people have an agenda you can see that from a mile away and some people will agree some people will disagree this is not that everyone that has looked at the evidence agrees Carter page they believe was a foreign agent and there has been a ton of connections to the Trump campaign and now unfortunately to the Trump administration as well but this latest one is pretty damning as usual
