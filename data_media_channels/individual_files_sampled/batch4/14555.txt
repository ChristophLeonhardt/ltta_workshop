three years ago in the Indian leader Narendra Modi came to Australia he gave this passionate speech to a huge crowd now one thing I found really interesting about what he said was that he said the key to Western economic success was the dignity we gave to just ordinary work even if it's dirty or low paid now this meant a lots of coming from someone who was a tea seller and rose to become the leader of one of the world's largest democracies and not just that one that's rooted in the institutionalized hierarchy of caste there aren't so many places in the world more status conscious than India but I think this feature of Western success that Modi identified is in decline and I'll explain why one reason is you can see it is the huge increase in disability pensions in Australia particularly for mental health reasons and the other is youths unemployment now they're just a big pension Australia's over 800,000 people and it costs 17 billion see billion dollars a year and most that increase recently has been due to mental health reasons and on top of that a lot of new jobs created in Australia are due to the National Disability Insurance Scheme that created 160,000 jobs in recent years so we're becoming this nation of the psychologically disabled supported in terms of employment by carers looking after those people now meanwhile youths defined by those aged 15 to 24 have almost 1/3 of them either unemployed or underemployed now I think one factor is actually the stigma attached to ordinary work especially for Generation that are sort of primed for aspiration and the success now my field of mental health has actually contributed to this in a major study a team from a major Australia University followed 7,000 people over seven years and what they found was jobs improved mental health but only if they're of a certain quality if any that were considered demoralizing they worsened what's known as subjective well-being the lead order author there Peter Butler said the study runs counter to a common belief that any job offers psychological benefits over the demeaning effects of unemployment the very interesting social workers have made reference to this study when I've tried to get patients of mine back to work now this despite the short nature of happiness studies or subjective reports of mental health the most of which lacked context or recognize the benefits of the long-term benefits of overcoming short-term adversity now this is where we start thinking job only for its monetary benefit or and what actually ends up happening is people start seeing money from welfare is essentially being the same as money from paying work this is a real problem now I think the declining significance of Christianity is a factor because I think Christianity really gives a sort of innate worth of everyone irrespective their economic value another thing is the decline of the celebration of manual work so a lot of movements labor movements throughout the 20th century did that now as those have declined mainly through automation or outsourcing the worth of those jobs also decreased the most recent figures in Australia show a 24 percent decline in manufacturing jobs in the last five years now the larger proportion of the population with a university education increased by a factor of 10 in 50 years is also acted to devalue semi skilled work I think modern mythologies of work of at the apex the digital knowledge worker kind of seen as the ultimate expression of workers expressing play now even cities the way we design cities is aimed at these workers and these residents and they have their requirement for the low paid service workers you know cleaners garbage collectors carers but most long term citizen aspirational youth don't want these jobs they don't want these are MEC jobs and the large proportion of newly arrived immigrants working in low paid work having some respects reduce both the statist and the cost of these kinds of jobs so the kind of ordinary that work once carried an innate dignity for a lot of people he's now seen as something for failures and foreigners now when you're seen in combination of forces now we're proclaiming pain gives you a degree of status and allows you to attract privilege it's is it any wonder that those on the board of disability or the precariat ie those people kind of in low-paid insecure work is that any any wonder that some of them will actually find to have greater esteem in disability as opposed to low paid work if you liked that video subscribe to rebel media you
