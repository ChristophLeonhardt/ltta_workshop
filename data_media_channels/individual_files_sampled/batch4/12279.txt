the Democratic National Convention kicked off its first day with the upbeat theme of working together a celebration of party unity that left 15 people dead and 72 injured the division in the party was so bad that the convention actually opened with a rendition of Battle Hymn of the Republic a song written to inspire the defeat of Democrats Democrats claim however that that was back in the bad old days when Democrats kept black people helplessly dependent and took actions to break up their families wait that's actually the party platform that's confusing Bernie Sanders tried to bring unity to the party by telling his supporters to vote for Hillary Clinton and he was then booed by his own supporters as one Sanders voter put it quote it's disgusting that this idiot Bernie Sanders would support Hillary Clinton when Bernie Sanders is so much better if Sanders continues to support Clinton I'll be so angry I'll ditch Sanders and support Clinton oh wait maybe I should support Sanders to get back at Sanders for supporting Clinton but then that would mean supporting Sanders when he supported Clinton when he should have supported Sanders which would be wrong anyway the important thing is that no one in America should have to work to earn money but everyone should be given money taken from the people who work to earn money who should be no:1 unquote the Sanders supporter then sank into a confused stupor which lasted until it was time for him to anchor ABC nightly news meanwhile Democratic congressman Hank Johnson had to backtrack after comparing Jews to termites Johnson who once expressed the fear that the island of Guam might capsize if too many people stood on one side of it now I'm just joking oh no wait I'm not joking he actually said that so he's like a Democrat congressman and an idiot but I repeat myself anyway Johnson told an anti-israel group the Jews are moving into Palestinian settlements like termites moving into a house Johnson later issued an apology saying quote when I compared Jews to termites I merely meant that Jewish people are like hideous flying insects who eat wood unquote American Jews said they could get used to flying around and eating wood as long as it meant they could continue to support the anti-semitic enemies of Israel by voting for Democrats in other bad news for Democrats a new hack of DNC documents revealed a list of talking points the Democrats have been distributing to their representatives so that they can defend Hillary Clinton the talking points are as follows one Hillary Clinton is one of the most knowledgeable people ever to run for president unless there's a scandal then she has absolutely no idea what's going on to Hillary Clinton is a wise foreign policy hand who pressed the reset button to establish friendly relations with Russia and the Russians are out to destroy her and three Hillary Clinton is a strong independent woman and Donald Trump is a bully for picking on a poor defenseless woman like Hillary Clinton the convention continues today with a theme of I hate all you people you're a bunch of jerks Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clayton show what a delightful convention it is it's like if you watch the news it's unfortunate if you watch the convention it's complete chaos but you know I noticed there was one more who's not spoken at the dimensions Isis now one time was it ever spoken and one word that was not spoken in the news coverage which was unrealistic so all right we're live on Facebook for 15 minutes and then your entire computer will shut down and they'll just be avoid unless you come over to the Daily wire and hear the rest of it where you can also subscribe and then you can continue to watch us and be part of tomorrow's mailbag yeah the mailbag is tomorrow and you can be there for just a lousy eight bucks a month which you were clinging to like greedy bums you are all right so so yesterday Michelle Obama made a wonderful speech in a wonderful dress and her smile was lovely and the speech was the stupidest speech I have ever heard and I will discuss that and talk about why I thought it was really a speech for idiots I mean it's all you heard about after all this chaos the DNC hack and all the stuff all you heard about was oh how wonderful Michelle Obama's speech was and she looked lovely and her dress was lovely and she spoke well and I think the speech was as stupid as it could possibly be but before we talk about that we have to talk about this other thing that happened that nobody was talking about at the convention which is in France there's been three major terrorist attacks in Germany in a week and then yesterday in France - Islamist knife men I'm reading from The Daily Mail butchered a French priest they basically broke into this church cut the priests head off in their charming way and left the nun fighting for her life before they were both shot dead by the police in Normandy one of the men who stormed into the church was a 19 year old French national who was being monitored by an electric tag after being jailed for trying to join the fanatics in Syria the priest was 86 years old he had his throat cut while a nun was critically injured and the guy was shouting of course all of who Akbar French authorities say they have arrested a third man in connection with attack French president Ilan said France is at war with Isis while the terror group has claimed responsibility for the killing it comes as it emerged that the building this Catholic Church was one of a number of Catholic churches on a terrorist hit list found on a suspected Isis extremists last April so this thing's you know so this has been going on and one of the French authorities says well we're just gonna have to get used to terrorism and you're really hearing this quite a lot in Europe and one of the things is is they don't understand this is not terrorism as they're used to it you know I lived in England during the 90s and for about two years during the 90s there was a spate of IRA bombings and I was standing on top of one of them when it went off literally on top of it as it went off in a tube station and it went off and it actually lifted me off the ground jumped out nobody was hurt well and that was the thing usually nobody was hurt now I'm not singing the praises of the IRA they killed a lot of people they need cat people they did horrible things but as they got more sophisticated they would start to call the police and say there's gonna be a bomb go off clear the area so it would cause all this damage which shut down shops it would cause economic hardship and all this but it wouldn't kill anybody and the reason was they were trying to accomplish something they were trying to affect hearts and minds because most terrorism is about land most terrorism is you are occupying our land get out and the excuse for it is we're just ordinary people and you are a nation with an army and we want our nation back and it's usually this kind of it's a separatist movement give us this piece of territory because this is where we come from and it's not fair for you to take it over they're trying to accomplish something so they think when we got hit on 9/11 a lot of Europeans said well now you know what it's like but this is different see this is a war of conquest this is an invasion they are not trying to get anything that it belongs to them they're not saying oh we were in England first give it back to us they're saying you were in England and now we're coming to take it you were in France and now it's ours you are infidels and we have to defeat you and destroy you and that's an entirely different thing and if they don't understand they're at war they can't fight back and that's why Obama's inability to speak the words Islamic extremism is such a joke you know because he doesn't understand the entire nature of what's going on they're not killing us to get anything there's nothing we can give them except our souls and our freedom that's gonna stop them from doing this and that's the problem so Brett Stevens wrote a brilliant column in The Wall Street Journal today he's their foreign correspondent foreign columnist and he wanted to know if Europe is helpless under this onslaught and he said there's one quick paragraph he said can the decline of Europe be stopped yes but that would require a great unlearning of the political mythologies on which modern Europe was built among those mythologies that the European Union is the result of a post-war moral commitment to peace that Christianity is of merely historical importance to European identity that's a myth he says has to be gotten rid of that Christianity Christianity is of merely historical importance that there's no such thing as a military solution that one's country isn't worth fighting for that honor is a de vista cand tolerance is the supreme value people who believe in nothing says Brett Stevens people who believe in nothing including themselves will ultimately submit to anything so we talked about this the other day about the scientists who went in to try to discover why Isis has such good fighters and he found out through his brilliant scientific methods is because they believed in something they believed in something beyond themselves and people in the West don't so he's saying basically and Brett Stevens is Jewish I don't know if he's a religious Jew but when he says that Christianity is of more than his it's foundational Christianity is foundational that is the bottom Ginga block in the tower of Western civilization and if we get rid of it the tower falls down now just compare this to David Brooks right in the New York Times a former newspaper this is David Brooks is one of what the the group that I call knucklehead Row the op-ed writers on the editorial writers in The New York Times and David Brooks maybe the chief would be the chief knucklehead if it weren't for all the rest of them and so he's talking now to Hillary Clinton because David Brooks is terrified of Donald Trump and he's telling Hillary Clinton what she has to do to make her party victorious right the Democrats this by the way he's thought he was supposed to be was advertisers of the conservative New York Times it's kind of like has no meaning I guess so this is Brooks telling Hillary Clinton first you're going to have to fight your party's materialistic mindset this is 2016 not 1992 over the past few years economic and social anxiety has metastasized into something spiritual and existential Americans are no longer confident in their national project they no longer trust their institutions or have faith in their common destiny this is a crisis of national purpose it's about personal identity and the basic health of communal life Americans anger and pessimism are more fundamental than anything that can be explained by GDP statistics many Democrats Brooks goes on have trouble thinking in these terms when asked to explain any complex phenomenon they instinctively reduce it to a materialist cause if there's terrorism there must be lack of Economic Opportunity if marriage is declining it must be because of joblessness this materialistic mindset means that many Democrats are perpetually surprised by events that involve cultural threats and national identity so Brooks is essentially saying the same thing to Hillary Clinton that Brett Stevens is saying to Europe the only difference is that Brooks doesn't understand that Hillary Clinton cannot embrace the spiritual because everything she believes is materialistic socialism is a materialistic Creed it says we can solve it says everything you do is based on your economic situation and every can be solved based on your economic situation so basically Brooks is calling on Hillary Clinton not to be Hillary Clinton which I would call it to do too if I thought she could believe me I would call on her to be Ted Cruz I would say please Hillary be Ted Cruz but but this is you know these are two guys on two sides of the fence Brett Stevens is an elitist but a conservative elitist Brooks is an elitist and a liberal elitist and both of them understand that the bottom stick in the Jenga tower has been pulled out you know and this is something you have been hearing on this show now for the since this show has begun that this is the solution the solution is going to come through a religious revival or it's not going to come that's the only way it's gonna happen and those of you who say to me you know I want to believe but I can't believe you better start thinking about it because because if it doesn't make sense to possibly it's you it's possible that you are sinking in an atmosphere and in a intellectual current that is sweeping you away from the actual truth okay so now let's let's go from that to Michelle all right the DNC is coming apart at the seams debbie Wasserman Schultz is being screamed at during her campaign you know there she's being booed off the stage people booed the prayer the opening prayer when Cynthia Hale the Reverend Cynthia Hale mentioned Hillary Clinton during the opening prayer they booed her and God had to be escorted off the stage with under security and and of course the the Democrats are screaming you know I told you yesterday that when there's a scandal on the Left the only thing that the press wants to talk about is how did you get that information how about how was that information obtained never mind what it says you know never mind the information itself so the Democrats have been saying well the Russians got this and they're trying to help Donald Trump which may or may not be true true you know who knows what Putin is thinking it could well be true but the only thing about that is we know that Putin has got everything you know Putin they said there was a story in the New York Post today where the guy said you know they stole Hillary Clinton's password off her machine it wasn't like they had to hack into her computer it was like they looked over her shoulder she was that careless with her security and that careless with our secrets so they just stole this thing so now Putin she's basically in Putin's power I mean at least rump wants to be where she actually is and by the way this idea that Putin that Trump is not going to defend Eastern Europe from Putin because they're in cahoots when has Obama done anything to defend Eastern Europe from Putin you know I mean they're all the same people all right so now Michelle steps up and you have to watch before we even play Michelle I just have to play from our friends at noose buzz Buster's one of my favorite sites news Buster's because they collect the bias of the press they put out a video of all the networks reacting to Michelle Obama's speech listen to this I think it was about as pitch perfect as an endorsement you can get it was a pretty succinct case for Hillary Clinton and against Donald Trump had done with trademark Michelle Obama race First Lady Michelle Obama polished passionate and personal said that only hit only one person is truly qualified to be President Clinton did not mention Donald Trump's name once John call but hard to argue that it wasn't a speech against Donald Trump that may have been the most effective one of the harshest speeches that we have heard against Donald Trump during the course of this game extremely cop speech don't let anyone ever tell you Michelle Obama delivered this speech and talked about Donald Trump's rhetoric not by name but there was no mistaking it and she did it not as a politician or as a politician's wife but as a mother a mother who has famously raised two young daughters in the public eye who have turned out to be pretty poised and you know it was a pretty rocky afternoon here at the Wells Fargo Center but when she said that her two daughters now know that they can be President because of Hillary Clinton not only did I see any dissension in this hall but there were a lot of moist guys - oh those moist eyes of course most of the moist eyes belong to the media but and Van Jones the leftist guy on my guess he's on CNN he was crying on air he was crying so just as a point of comparison also from our friends at News Buster's let's look at how Trump's speech was received by the media leader ready to put America back on track either saw a lot of doom and gloom this wasn't exactly Ronald Reagan shining city on the hill it wasn't george w bush's compassionate conservatism trump cast himself as an angry and all-powerful national defender the GOP nominee hammering home nationalist themes presenting the country as a dark place I don't think he'd broaden his appeal here a little bit it was a very I don't know how many people I think there are some people that wake up and say wow the country is deteriorating but I think a lot of people didn't recognize that country that he described either so I think it's a very polarizing speech yeah what looks on your point there this wasn't the shining city on the hill this wasn't morning in America he sounded like a wartime president last it's very dark so dark and speaking of dark we have to say goodbye to our friends on Facebook you are going to art come and join us at the Daily wire so so Trump is dark dark dark and that was on every report dark dark dark dark dark and this one was emotional there's emotional you know even on even on YouTube when you know you went up to look up the speech it's like you know here's Michelle Obama's emotional speech you went to look up the transcript here's the transcript of her emotional speech you know like like I I wonder are there talking points they're spreading around I just wondered so an emotional speech and I will say she looked lovely and it was an effective speech I don't want to say that it wasn't an effective speech it did you know she said it was a rocky day that was not how they were describing you know there was a little bit of a floor fight there was a floor fight the first day of the Republican convention and that was chaos that was repeatedly referred to as chaos there was chaos at the Democratic convention yesterday it was genuine chaos and it was a little rocky little rocky in the press rocky but then Michelle Obama put everyone together so it was very effective she looked nice the dress looked nice she's pretty she smiled let's take a look at the speech let's listen to what she actually said she starts out by talking about the fact her daughters she's gotten her husband's got an elected president the daughters get into the big limousine with all these men big men as she described them with guns and she says I thought to myself oh my god what have we done because now these girls are gonna be brought up in you know their formative years in the White House so here's what she talks about with every word we utter with every action we take we know our kids are watching us we as parents are their most important role models and let me tell you Barack and I take that same approach to our jobs as president and first lady because we know that our words and actions matter not just to our girls but the children across this country kids kids who tell us I saw you on TV I wrote a report on you for school kids like the little black boy who looked up at my husband his eyes wide with hope and he wondered is my hair like yours and make no mistake about it this November when we go to the polls that is what we're deciding not Democrat or Republican not left there right now in this election and every election is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of their lives what that's what we're deciding that you know Obama said this in the his first election that when he first ran some reporter asked him why he wanted to be president and he didn't say to affect the country to fundamentally transform the country he said I want a black boy to be able to look and say I can be President and I thought I wrote at the time I wrote a piece for The Wall Street Journal which the journal wouldn't publish I said you know that's not a reason to be President that's a reason to pretend to be president that's a reason to play the president on TV you know to be a role model for children she's basically telling us that all of us are children that she is going to affect with it that's why we're voting for a role model and that's her hit at Trump that Trump is not a good role model but we're not voting for a role model no I don't need a role model in fact in the neighborhoods that she should be most concerned about they could use a dad at home for a role model they don't need the president for a role model you know the president may set the tone but that's not his job his job is to a defend the country from foreign attackers which Obama has failed that miserably to manage the economy to manage the legislative branches all of which Obama has failed to do miserably okay so that's so basically she's telling us we're all children were all their children and we're electing mommy that's what she's telling us listen she goes on play the second cut I am here tonight because in this election there is only one person who I trust with that responsibility only one person who I believe is truly qualified to be President of the United States and that is our friend Hillary Clinton I trust I trust Hillary to lead this country because I've seen her lifelong devotion to our nation's children not just her own daughter who she has raised to perfection but but every child who needs a champion kids who take the long way to school to avoid the gangs kids who wonder how they'll ever afford college kids whose parents don't speak a word of English but dream of a better life kids who look to us to determine who and what they can be you know we're elected she's she's running from mommy she's running to be my mom you know it's like by the way not that good a job first of all she ought to know it's a thankless it's a thankless occupation in my particular case but on top of that it's like this paternalistic or maternal istic you know what difference does it make whether it's paternalistic or maternal istic you know the the one of my big objections to Trump is his strong man attitude I alone can solve you know it's gonna be great when I do it it's gonna be great I don't need to tell you how I'm gonna fix it I'm gonna fix it it's gonna be me it's gonna be Trump it's gonna have those big letters and back of it so it's gonna be terrific you know I despise that stuff tell me what you're gonna do you're an executive you're an executive of a company you're running to be a chief executive of a company called America just tell me what you're gonna do put on a tie and go do it you know now this is all these on the left are the same people you know this is all they've got is we are going to show you how to be we're gonna be role models and the funny thing is is people fall for this because even though a majority of people a huge majority of people think this country is going in the wrong direction a lot of people approve of the job Oh Rocco Bachmann is doing because you know what this is what they approve of they approve of this job they think he makes a nice role model he's cool he's hip he's funny he's relaxed you know I mean he comes on on the late-night shows and he does a good job and that's what they're talking about they're not talking about whether he's doing a good job as president they're talking about whether he's doing a good job playing the president and that's what Michelle Obama is is selling you and the infantile press loves it they love it please make us into children let's finish up don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great that somehow we need to make it bring it again because this right now is the greatest country on Earth and as my my daughter's prepare to set out into the world I want a leader who is worthy of that truth a leader who is worthy of my girl's promise and all our kids promise a leader who will be guided everyday by the love and hope and impossibly big dreams that we all have for our children uh it's a it's an this is an insane speech almost and the thing is like I said she looks great she's you know she sounds good she's upbeat I don't know what happened to this is the first time as an adult I've been proud of my country what happened to angry Michelle I guess angry Michelle is offstage and electric goes back I think you burn the cage we only I love my country my country is great no I stay in the cage angry Michelle you know it's like suddenly they want they feel that the press their minions in the press sold to the people this idea that the Republican convention was chaotic and dark so this is gonna be unified and happy and the fact that they're all ripping each other's throats out doesn't matter it doesn't matter see here's the problem you know the Wall Street Journal has an op-ed an editorial today which means it comes from their editors and written without a a signature and it talks about the fact that President Obama has succeeded in much of what he wants to do and says President Obama said in 2008 that he wanted to be the reverse Ronald Reagan and in one sense he has been as he takes the Democratic stage in Philadelphia he's going to talk tonight I'm sorry Wednesday he can rightly claim to have fulfilled most of his major progressive policy goals the difference is the results after eight years of Reagan the Cold War was on the way to ending and the US economy had grown by the size of Germany mr. Obama is leaving to his successor a world of spreading disorder and a country as the anxious and more politically polarized than he inherited in other words Obama has been a successful leftist president he has done a lot of the things he said he was gonna do he passed Obamacare with his supermajority although nobody else has signed on for these nationalized the student loan industry he's turned banks into public utilities with the dodd-frank and everybody's unhappy you know the end at the end of the Reagan era people were upbeat and thrilled they were thrilled because the economy was booming and it boomed for a quarter of a century afterwards it boomed right until the minute it crashed you know after after george w bush you know this is the important thing Hillary Clinton is taking over a leftist party a party to the left of hers and she does not have the strength of character or the affection to move it back to the center the way Bill Clinton did this is a party this is Bernie Sanders party that she is taking over and so while it may be funny to us as conservatives to watch them tearing each other apart we better come up with an answer because we have we bought one right now I mean what we've got is this nationalistic authoritarian and what drives me crazy I mean you can hear how much I dislike the press I think they are insanely corrupt I think they're insanely dishonest I don't even think that they pretend not to be biased anymore I mean they used to at least be hypocrites they used to say I remember the New York Times editor saying you know the New York Times plays it straight you know I thought like really I mean do you really think that maybe they did who knows maybe they did they don't even pretend anymore they ate dot there is a an evil you know attacked on Trump every day in the New York Times the problem is that what they're saying is true that's the problem with Donald Trump the Trump is a bad candidate he's a bad person he's he's not a conservative he's a left winger you know he's a guy who believes in government he believes in the strong man and all this stuff and we we had given legitimacy to this dishonest press to now say what is untrue that Hillary Clinton Clinton is qualified to be president she's no in no way qualified morally or intact in terms of her intelligence and experience to be President like Obama who has failed at everything he's touched everything Obama has touched has turned and and and he and that was a success for him because his policies don't work the same thing is doing true with Hillary Clinton everything she has touched you cannot name you cannot name something that she has made better you can't name it and we you know we who elevated those of us who elevated Trump have given the press cover to tell us to tell the truth about Trump but tell us lies about Hillary Clinton it's a bad bad situation all right this brings me to stuff I like okay because yesterday I was talking about Hail Caesar and it caused me to reflect you know what shocked me about Hail Caesar was its depiction of Hollywood communists as the bad guys because Hollywood has been moaning for years for decades about oh we were blacklisted during the you know and I felt like yeah well you were trying to sell people on this murderous you know Stalinist philosophy maybe you should have been blacklisted maybe you know if you had been selling people Nazi philosophy nobody would care that you were blacklisted but you were selling something just as bad so I was really shocked that the Hail Caesar actually depicted them at least somewhat in that way and I was thinking you know there aren't that many films that show you communism as it was at its height and here's one that's really really obscure I'm not gonna tell you this is a great movie because it's not it's a TV movie and so it has some cheap production values it has a good cast it has Donald Sutherland and Steven ray and Max von Sydow so it's an excellent excellent cast but the story that it tells which is an absolutely true story is fascinating it's called citizen X and it's based on a nonfiction book by Robert Cullen called the killer Department and I started reading the book but I got kind of lost in the forest of details whereas the the movie tells the story pretty clearly it's the story of a Soviet cop who admired American police procedural police procedures and he started to try and learn them and it was hard because it was hard to get information from the West but as he started to learn them he started to realize that a serial killer was on the loose if vicious vicious serial killer did terrible things to children so he went before the committee which was the police were under the military I think and Donald saw the one plays the guy was heading that committee and he goes and he tries to explain to them that his serial killer is on the loose this is in the 80s and listen to what they say it's clear that we have a serial killer on our hands already the most prolific in Russian history will have to take extreme methods to stop him if you say a serial killer we understood they were right discrepancies between the wounds inflicted that's what you told us : and both boys and girls it could be two different men it could be a gang there are no serial killers in the Soviet state well that sounds more like wishful thinking than it it is a decadent Western phenomenon gentlemen that's all we have for now thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules I'll keep you abreast of any developments no pun intended guys this went on for decades it's a real story went on for decades they refuse to admit there could be a serial killer they said it must be a homosexual it must be a Jew it must be all the people that the Soviets disliked and they would bring in these poor guys and beat the you know the bejesus out of them and get it try and getting them to confess while the serial killer went at-large in the cop started to go insane the cop literally started to break down it's a great great story and a really well done movie I'm not gonna tell you it's a great movie but just so fascinating for its story and for its depiction of what the Soviet Union really was citizen X that's it if the Democrats don't kill each other well maybe we'll kill who knows what we'll do our best to discredit them and we'll be back again tomorrow I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show thanks for coming by come back
