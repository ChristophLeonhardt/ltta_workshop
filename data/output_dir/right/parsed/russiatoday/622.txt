for the first time in 8 years the
Palestinian Postal Service is back in
full swing
after mail had previously been halted by
Israel 10 tons of undelivered packages
and letters have been handed over after
being held for years that's despite an
agreement not to intervene with
deliveries going to Palestine
mother pink infers Albury there was a
wheelchair there were some gifts that
people had been waiting for other things
were found like toys and a TV
and I'm okay with him in year since 2008
many agreements have been signed with
the Israeli side but it still avoids
direct shipments from Jordan
Ezreal says both sides came to an
understanding about a year ago on postal
deliveries but that did not result in a
permanent direct transfer of mail
