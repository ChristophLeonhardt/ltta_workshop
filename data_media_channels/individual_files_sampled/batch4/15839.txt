we all are freaking night vision goggles online kind of stuff and we can't freakin control these dudes wearing freaking robes and chocolates because we got a bunch of dumb shit so think about the people who you know where you're freaking stupid on the lure you weren't there dumb shit remember Gregory salcedo mr. tough guy of sunglasses is a council man of Pico Rivera in California a three-time mayor of the city and a history teacher or rather a former history teacher you see the El Rancho School District voted unanimously to fire Salcido after his anti military rant went viral of course not you know what takes true talents using your taxpayer-funded position to shove your opinion down the throats of people three times younger than you yes definitely more nuanced than commandeering a tanker calibrating high-tech radar El Rancho Board of Education president Aurora Villain said Sal see those comments do not reflect what we stand for who we are the classroom should never be a place where students feel that they are picked at bullied intimidated as for salcedo 'he's council position a city spokesman told me that the mayor and the two other council members passed a resolution asking him to resign so Salcido sacking is a rare case of a progressive getting the taste of their own medicine a social media lynch mob followed up with real-world consequences but it wasn't all Harrah's across the ante leftist sphere of the internet principled libertarian Robbie so Van Driessen calm says as far as I can tell Salceda wasn't bullying any specific member of his classroom did you catch the part of the footage where he calls out a student for wearing a Marine Corps sweatshirt Robbie don't you ever bring the Salcedo and sissy isn't anti-military but another one of his students wearing marine clothing the day of the rant told his teacher he wanted to join the military because it was a family tradition Salceda reportedly asked him that if it were a family tradition to beat woman with a student also do that real clean analogy they are Gregory and definitely not anti military at all back at reason.com so says any conservative who makes fun of liberal students demanding safe spaces but then turns around and says people who question the troops should lose their jobs is being awfully hypocritical fair point but consider this Salcedo wasn't some random twitter user making an incendiary remark no he held power over his students I can't imagine any of them would feel comfortable extolling the virtues of a military or even presenting them in any sort of flattering light at all for a class essay after hearing that screed for campus unmasked I'm Rob from shell if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm
