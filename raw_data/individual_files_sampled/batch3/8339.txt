Bret: WELCOME BACK WITH FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY. SINCE YOUR FIRING, HAVE YOU MET WITH FORMER CIA DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN? YES. ONCE, I THINK. Bret: AND FORMER NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR JIM CLAPPER? YEAH. I SAW HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST. Bret: TOGETHER. ACTUALLY I HAD DINNER WITH THE TWO OF THEM AND OUR SPOUSES. Bret: TALK TRUMP CASE. NO, WE DID NOT. Bret: AFTER YOUR HAND-PICKED DEPUTY ANDY MCCABE WAS FIRED, YOU TWEETED THIS, YOU SAID SPECIAL AGENT MCCABE STOOD TALL OVER THE LAST 8 MONTHS WHEN SMALL PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO TEAR DOWN AN INSTITUTION WE ALL DEPEND ON. HE SERVED WITH DISTINCTION FOR TWO DECADES I WISH ANDY WELL. I WISH CONTINUED STRENGTH FOR THE REST OF THE FBI. AMERICA NEEDS YOU. YOU KNOW THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOUND THAT MCCABE LIED FOUR TIMES, THREE OF THEM UNDER OATH. KIMBERLY STROSSEL FROM THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" TWEET ADD LOT OF POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU BUT HERE'S ONE. PLEASE DISCUSS ANDREW MCCABE AND THE IG REPORT THAT FINDS HE LIED REPEATEDLY, BOTH TO YOU AND ABOUT YOU. DO YOU STILL BELIEVE HE STOOD TALL AS YOU TWEETED IN JANUARY OR IS HE ONE OF THE SMALL PEOPLE HELPING TO TEAR DOWN AN INSTITUTION? YEAH. I STILL BELIEVE HE STOOD TALL. HE REPRESENTED HIMSELF AND THE ORGANIZATION UNDER TREMENDOUS STRESS DURING THAT PERIOD AFTER I WAS FIRED. BUT I READ THE IG REPORT AS YOU DID. IT CONCLUDED THAT ANDY HAD NOT BEEN CANDID. THIS IS WHAT ACCOUNTABILITY LOOKS LIKE IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. Bret: SHOULD HE BE PROSECUTED? THAT'S NOT FOR ME. Bret: YOU SAID IT IN THE CLINTON CASE. I WAS THEN THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI. I'M A PRIVATE CITIZEN. PRIVATE CITIZENS SHOULD NOT BE CALLING FOR THE PROSECUTION OF PEOPLE IN A CASE THEY ARE NOT INVOLVED IN. BUT, I DO BELIEVE, AS IT ROUTINELY HAPPENS, THE IG WILL LIKELY REFER OR HAS REFERRED IT TO A U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO LOOK AT IT. Bret: SO, DID YOU YOU SEE THE DISPARITY HERE WHERE PEOPLE LOOK AT HOW THE CLINTON CASE WAS HANDLED AND HOW THE TRUMP CASE IS HANDLED. DID YOU TELL I DON'T SEE DISPARITY THOUGH. Bret: DID YOU TELL LAWMAKERS THAT FBI AGENTS DIDN'T BELIEVE FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR MICHAEL FLYNN WAS LYING INTENTIONALLY TO INVESTIGATORS? NO. AND I SAW THAT IN THE MEDIA. MAYBE SOMEONE MISUNDERSTOOD SOMETHING I SAID. I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT AND DIDIDN'T SAY THAT. Bret: ABOUT THE CONTROVERSIAL TEXT MESSAGES, WE JUST RECEIVED A LOT MORE UP ON CAPITOL HILL TODAY. IF YOU KNEW BACK THEN WHEN YOU WERE IN CHARGE OF THE INVESTIGATION, AND YOU SAW THOSE TEXTS BETWEEN PETER STRZOK AND LISA PAGE, THE LEVEL OF ANIMUS THEY HAD AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHAT WOULD HAVE YOU DONE. I WOULD HAVE REMOVED BOTH OF THEM FROM ANY CONTACT WITH SIGNIFICANT INVESTIGATIONS. Bret: SO SHOULDN'T THEIR WORK INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING ANYBODY CONNECTED TO PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT BEYOND THAT SUCH POOR JUDGMENT. Bret: SHOULD THEIR WORK PRODUCT THEN BE QUESTIONED. SURE. IT'S A REASONABLE QUESTION TO ASK. THEY WERE BAD MOUTHING EVERYBODY, INCLUDING CANDIDATE TRUMP. Bret: PETER STRZOK INTERVIEWS HILLARY CLINTON. DEALS WITH THE BLEACH BIT AND THE SERVER AND CHERYL MILLS, ALL OF THAT INTERVIEWS MICHAEL FLYNN, AND INTEGRAL IN THIS WHOLE CASE. HE IS ONE OF MANY OTHER PEOPLE INVOLVED IN ALL THE THINGS YOU JUST TICKED OFF. IT'S A REASONABLE QUESTION TO ASK. AND I CAN TELL YOU THIS. WHEN I SAW THE TEXT, I WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED IN THEM. BUT I NEVER SAW ANY BIAS ANY REFLECTION OF ANY KIND OF ANIMUS TOWARDS ANYBODY. INCLUDING ME. THOSE TEXTS. I'M NOT GOING TO READ THEM ALL. NEVER SAW IT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SUCH A BIG. Bret: THE BUCK STOPS WITH YOU. OF COURSE. Bret: JONATHAN TWEETED IN WHAT WAS THE INSURANCE POLICY DEPUTY DIRECTOR MCCABE STRZOK AND PAGE WERE DISGUSTING IN HIS OFFICE. I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA. Bret: NO CLUE. IF ANYBODY PULLED ANY OF YOUR LISTENERS TEXT OR VIEWERS' TEXTS NO CONTEXT HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. Bret: THERE IS A LOST OF TEXT AND A LOT OF CONTEXT WITH THOSE GUYS. THE ONES I HAVE LOOKED AT I HAVE HAD A HARD TIME FIGURING OUT. Bret: THIS MORNING THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAID THIS ON "FOX & FRIENDS." IF YOU LOOK AT THE CORRUPTION AT THE TOP OF THE FBI, IT'S A DISGRACE. AND OUR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, WHICH I TRY AND STAY AWAY FROM, BUT AT SOME POINT I WON'T. Bret: WHAT DO YOU THINK HE MEANT THERE? I DON'T KNOW. I HOPE HE DIDN'T MEAN THAT HE IS GOING TO DECIDE BY EXECUTIVE FIAT TO DIRECT THE ACTIONS OF WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN IMPARTIAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FUNCTION. LADY JUSTICE HAS A BLINDFOLD. IT SHOULD STAY ON. Bret: DID THE INSPECTOR GENERAL INTERVIEW YOU ABOUT YOUR HANDLING OF THE MEMOS? SURE, YEAH. Bret: HAS? HAS ALREADY. I EXPECT A REPORT ON THEM NOT ON THE HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT'S FRIVOLOUS BUT ON DID I COMPLY WITH POLICY? DID I COMPLY WITH MY EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT? Bret: YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T LEAK THERE IS A "NEW YORK TIMES" STORY IN APRIL 2017 THAT FIRST REPORTED THE LORETTA LYNCH EMAIL. YOU DIDN'T WRITE IT B. IT HERE IN THIS BOOK BECAUSE YOU SAID IT'S CLASSIFIED. THE "NEW YORK TIMES" WROTE A LOT ABOUT IT DID THE FBI PUBLIC AFFAIRS COORDINATE THAT STORY. NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON ANY STORIES BECAUSE I'M NOT ALLOWED TO CONFIRM OR DENY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. Bret: ALL RIGHT IN THE INFAMOUS OVAL OFFICE MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN HE ASKED YOU TO STAY BEHIND ONE-ON-ONE. YOU WRITE IN THE BOOK THAT YOU FELT AWKWARD. YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT. CORRECT. Bret: YOU HAD BEEN ONE-ON-ONE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA IN THE OVAL OFFICE? CORRECT. Bret: BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT. YEAH. BECAUSE HE BOOTED OUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES WHO WAS LINGERING TRYING TO STAY. Bret: AS OPPOSED TO THE PRESIDENTIAL PHOTOGRAPHER WHO PRESIDENT OBAMA BOOTS OUT? SURE. Bret: YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T PUSH BACK WHEN HE SAID HE HOPED YOU COULD SEE YOUR WAY THAT HE WAS A GOOD GUY. HOPED YOU COULD LET IT GO. YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T PUSH BACK AND HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT HE COULDN'T DO THAT. ALL RIGHT. SO LET'S ASSUME THAT'S TRUE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. THAT IS IT POSSIBLE THERE WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU DIDN'T PUSH BACK AND THAT IS THAT YOU WANTED TO KEEP YOUR JOB? IT'S POSSIBLE BUT IT'S NOT THE CASE. AT LEAST I DON'T REMEMBER THINKING ABOUT THAT AT THE TIME. Bret: YOU TOLD CNN LAST NIGHT THAT YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD BE FIRED. THAT YOU KNOW, HAD YOU NOT BEEN FIRED, YOU WOULD STILL BE WORKING AS FBI DIRECTOR TONIGHT. YEAH. IN FACT, THAT WAS MY INTENTION TO SERVE ANOTHER SIX YEARS. Bret: SO, DESPITE THE FACT THAT NOW YOU SAY THAT THIS PRESIDENT IS MORALLY UNFIT, THAT YOU SAY IMPEACHMENT IS TOO GOOD OF A REMEDY ON THE BOOK TOUR. THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID. I SAID IN A WAY I HOPE NOT BECAUSE I THINK THE VOTERS NEED TO SPEAK. BRET BRET EXACTLY ON THE MEDIA TOUR AND THE BLITZ YOU ARE BASICALLY ENCOURAGING VOTERS TO VOTE TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE BECAUSE HE DOESN'T LINE UP WITH YOUR VALUES. I'M ASKING THEM TO VOTE THEIR VALUES AND WHAT I BELIEVE YOUR VIEWERS WOULD AGREE ARE AMERICA'S VALUES. Bret: OKAY. BUT AS OF TONIGHT, HAD YOU NOT BEEN FIRED, YOU WOULD STILL BE WORKING FOR THIS GUY THAT YOU SAY IS LIKE A CRIME BOSS WHO IS MORALLY UNFIT, WHO YOU JUST DON'T AGREE WITH ON PRINCIPLE AND VALUES. YOU WOULD STILL HAVE THAT JOB TONIGHT? ABSOLUTELY. AND MY GOAL WOULD TO BE PROTECT THE FBI AND SERVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Bret: WHEN YOU SAY. I RESPECT THAT OFFICE TREMENDOUSLY. Bret: WHEN YOU SAY TO REPUBLICANS WHY DO YOU WORK WITH THIS PRESIDENT AND SIT
