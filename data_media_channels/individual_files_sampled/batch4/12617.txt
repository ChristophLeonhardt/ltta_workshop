I do have to point out the media's double standard here roseann should have lost her job for reasons that I will explain in just a second first of all it really should requires no explanation that that statement for a public figure you lose your job end of story but the media to refrain from pointing out the double standard when joy read who tweet out a bunch of other gross stuff and Al Sharpton who is one of the worst race baiters in the history of the United States at least in modern American history to have those two people commenting on it with Valerie Jarrett who was targeted by Roseanne but also happened to be a member of an administration that was very happy to polarizing along the basis of race it provides a little bit of irony sitting there alongside chris hayes who says that all Trump supporters are basically Roseanne hi-yah anyway here is Valerie Jarrett commenting on the situation well first of all I think we have to turn it into a teaching moment I'm fine I'm worried about all the people out there who don't have a circle of friends and followers who come right to their defense the person who's walking down the street minding their own business and they see somebody cling to their purse or one across the street or every black parent I know who has a boy who has to sit down and have a conversation but talk as we call it and those as you say those ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day and I always get this routine where everybody is Rosanna where America is replete with Roseanne's where people in their back room are tweeting out crazy stuff like Roseanne Roseanne is a crazy person Roseanne tweeted out that she was on ambien and that's why she tweeted this out which prompted ambien in pretty hilarious fashion to tweet back one of our side effects does not include racism I'm good for ambien and it's true whenever I saw the Zambian commercials I never saw that butterfly with the KKK hood on it that was just and I never picked up on that but Valerie Jarrett suggesting that we are all Roseanne is the stupidest thing in the world Roseanne said something bad you know what the effect was she lost her job she lost a multi-million dollar job as the top sitcom performer in the United States and Valerie Jarrett is saying this this somehow olympians the entire United States somehow this is everyday racism in America hey it's not everyday racism in America because if it were everyday racism in America Roseanne wouldn't have lost her job I'm kind of getting sick of this routine where we smear the entire American public and all Trump supporters with the brush of Roseanne Barr okay then joy read comments on Roseanne is a year's joy read again a woman who tweeted out a bunch of really nasty stuff like four weeks ago and then recalled that she had amnesia she literally claims she had amnesia which is a plot line that went out of soap operas in the 1980s she claimed that she had amnesia she still has a job in she gets to comment on Roseanne Barr here is joy reed on MSNBC commenting on it they see this as no big deal that this is something that you should be able to say why can't you say it but it's just jokes why are people taking it too hard that's part of the problem is that you have a certain set of people who feel that you shouldn't be able to speak this way and unfortunately you know we have a president at the moment it was kind of giving a broad sense of permission to not be politically correct to speak the way you want to offend who you want and that people really shouldn't have a right to say anything about it okay this is all this is all straw man I didn't see one major conservative commentator yesterday saying Roseanne should've kept her job not one okay then the number of conservative commentators who said Roseanne should have kept her job it was relegated to like Jack cassabi AK and maybe like Ollie like a couple of guys who are really fringe and aren't considered mainstream right figures in any case but they're treating it as though the entire right came out swarming in defense of Roseanne Barr obviously not true obviously not real but the entire left did come out swarming for joy Reid right so if you're in if you're in entire one movement with the actions of a bad person you might want it's harder the movement with the person they actually defend so if you want to say that Trump's base is willing to defend his excesses that I agree with but if you want to say that Trump's base is willing to defend Roseanne Barr I don't see who Trump's base defending Roseanne Barr today and the same thing is not true of jury read the entire left base came out in defense of joy Reid very few of them wanted Roy Reid to lose her job the same thing is true of Louis Farrakhan of Linda Sarsour of a bunch of people keith Ellison who have associated with the worst kinds al Sharpton you know terrible terrible people who have been defended repeatedly by the left Roseanne Barr lost her job after less than like four hours after the suite came out so don't tell me the entire right-wing base is supporting Roseanne Barr it just ain't true
