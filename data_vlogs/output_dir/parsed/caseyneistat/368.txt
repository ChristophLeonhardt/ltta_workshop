hi there I wanted to share my VidCon
experience but not share it in like a
regular video I wanted to show what the
actual experience is like and that's
something you can only really do in 360
so this is my Big Town experience I'm
gonna start here in this hotel room it's
not a particularly glamorous hotel room
it's got this couch it's not this bed
there's one window with a great view of
the parking lot like this kitchenette
situation over here and I probably
shouldn't show you the bathroom it's
like pretty disgusting in here don't
don't look around too much this is the
roof of the parking garage it's the only
place I could find in all of VidCon but
I can safely fly that drone without
having any security or police give me a
really hard time
ready
what's that I'm a big there oh I'm a fan
of you Casey
ah my name is Casey just I'm like
shooting a scene for my 360 video right
now this is what it's like to be in a
panel at VidCon I make daily videos
mostly the savory vlogs and then
sometimes daily other videos
well it looks like it the con when
you're trying to get a car to leave the
hotel Thanks
I set it down
my girls show this is us
Tacey you should probably take this
yeah
this is what the ballet looks like at
VidCon
and this is looks like eating good time
it's all a little sad goodbye
my god
