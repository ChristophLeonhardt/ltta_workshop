welcome to the Stan Collymore show I'm in Medellin in Colombia filming for a future episode so watch this space but this week's episode comes from Paris Frank LeBoeuf a World Cup winner sits down with us to have a chat we're gonna be shut into a former teammate of mine the legend that is Ian Rush and Rob Blanchette goes up to Manchester to look at some of the world classic football shirts welcome to the Stan Collymore show we're in Paris the city of lights to talk about on the greatest time in French football and that was winning the World Cup in 1998 Frank LeBoeuf let's go back to 1994 if I'm a European champions how disappointing was it as a nation as a young footballer to not qualify for 1994 that was a disaster because we had two games in hand too and we needed one point to go through and to go to the United States and it didn't work we lost the two games we had at home and it was a real disaster I mean the the the dream that we have we had to see that beautiful squad going to the United State fell off in one minute with costed enough goals with four boug higher at the last second and everybody was the shame of being a French guy loving football you have to remember the European Championship in 92 was also a disaster well we went we went out after the the group stage so we had the idea of rebuilding everything in fact in an international way and and when Emma Jackie took charge of the of the job we just followed him he had an idea of creating a club inside the the selection the steam started to be built right 95 96 just before the European Championship in England and where we winded up finishing I think third or fourth it was a real new adventure to recreate you have the time to recreate something to be ready for years after in 98 how important with the Anglos you Omri yeah how important was that group of players that were all playing at big clubs Chelsea Arsenal Manchester United when people talk about me knowing me from from the French site I was a tough guy when I go to England that was kind of you know a little shy shy shy shy shy guy playing inning against Stan Collymore and being afraid of being kicked and the fact is it is true but going to England for me for Emmanuel Petrova tree we are it was learning the the defining spirit and never let it go always having the hope that we can finish something even if you are you we are losing to Neal and and that's what we learned but did you fail before the tournament did you fail in the friendly matches was it all preparation to win the tournament we were we weren't good we were in good we didn't play well just before the World Cup we didn't have the thing that we could go that far really none Saddam was indeed under the time did another average 1996 work European Championship and remember if you see all the games what we had in 98 he got suspended you get red carded after the second game came back for the the quarter final against Italy had two very good games for the quarter and the Sammis but became really done in the final what was your individual emotion about getting that final call that piece of piece of paper fédération française football you are included delight congratulations you're included in the final 23 players to represent France at a home World Cup well I I know I I looked on Wikipedia I mean II caps your hand so you know how important it is and how proud you are you know when you you read your name and just before the worker if I had maybe like 12 12 caps for the for the national team so we rookie it kind of kind of but lots of calls were not coming into and and and when you know you're gonna play a war cup in your country when it's it's a good prize you know all your family calls you you see wow you are in see I mean and I'm gonna fight for for you to make sure you got everybody is gonna be proud of the tournament itself you go through the group stages there's some substitute appearances because obviously Laurent Blanc was the yeah was the top mounted table menu how did that make you feel first when I saw Marcel being Rick no harm being read Carla de I felt ashamed in a way that I knew that if we would win with one would be I would be in the first eleven and I finished on my it's not really my place three days before the walk up I couldn't watch TV or listen to radio or read papers because was always how can we win without Rohan block so you really feel like your piece of mm-hm and and I didn't know what what to do and I say to my ex-wife I said you know what if we win we can if we lose we're gonna stay in England I'm not and will never come back to France well it went well it worked well I played a decent game and and we want so everything is perfectly the other day you know but the fairy tale could have been a nightmare so Laurent Blanc gets a red card in the semi-final you then when did M Jack I say to you that you were playing never said we at the talk two months before the World Cup where you say okay you know what there is a loja and Marcel we're gonna play if any one of them is recorded or injured you play so as soon as loja was recorded I knew that if we would go through I would play tell Eugene freedom a dressing room it's a mixture of thing that time goes very slow before the game you want to be on the pitch you want to play you desperate to be in the battle in the battle and it's key he's getting very long and I remember coming to into the stadium getting out of the bus and taking my heart rate I was 180 really so you're already sprinting I was already there and then when we went into the dressing room it was over I was different because it was home did that make you relaxed you mentioned nice family friend it's worse it's worse do you have the pressure of a country you don't want to ruin the the the the party after you know everybody was ready to party and they did but you can run it at the end of the day it's again it's a football game so when you are into that game you don't think oh it's a walk up um yeah I have to be better because it's a welcome now you know some players think that some players lose their their their calm I guess they play the game before he has to be done I think it's different between a champ and and somebody no not quite less ready to fight for those this intensity of the of the game and the pressure the kid get is if that's your pocket after the game well now that was in it so you're playing the game you've got one of the world's best strikers you're having a fantastic game does your confidence grow as the game is happening oh yes definitely after the first ball you know you know I put on the first touches you know when you control well or you pass well you know you feel confident and and the first I think that I had on I think it was Rivaldo I said okay I'm I mean I mean and I'm okay I'm gonna be good until the end so well do you know that things can change but you you start well so you know money you finish well I did better than my idols which is impossible normally so it took me like I would say three four years maybe at the end of my career that I realized I became worker players you know when I'm in France every day every day there is somebody say oh thank you very much for the work up for the last 20 years so it takes the time you had when the whistle goes you know when the ref says at the end of the game you just lose the pressure tell us about the after experience is the party the relief the enjoyment of a world coping going up the Sean's ELISA one of the world's great avenues with five million people around you yeah when when you bring into the competition when you are in the swimmies and between the cities and and and the finals we we saw the people down the streets but we didn't realize you know it was on TV and everything and when we want you know okay we want and we went back to Clairefontaine where we have the castle and we thought you feel that you were sheltered from the public yeah yeah of course and you have to it's not good thing yeah it was a good thing because you had to protect yourself and make sure that you you are into the competition you don't see what's going on you know outside the the the Clairefontaine so when we did the day after when we went to to the Shands ELISA and went down to too close to plus de la Concorde and we saw that amount of people who say oh my god we did something big we did something big and it was crazy for two hours it was crazy and it never stopped for like the 15 days holidays that I had he never stopped I went in Corsica I dared to evacuate him meat from the beach people was getting crazy as I don't really want to deploy the Magnum for me but imagine for zinedine zidane yeah he had to hide and because he's the icon of that team and and it's it's crazy it's fantastic I work now for with Emmanuel party and Christophe do Gary we see each other every day for television and we know we feel that something special he's under brothers that's real ever take that away from you never I would call you a proper actor a method actor theatre the shraddha vivre learning your lines yeah putting on 20 kilo for it for me why acting why I think because I thought about being an actor before thinking of being a football player and when I was four or five years old I was watching on TV plays with my mother and she recalled me that I said I want to do that did you find that difficult after playing football it is it is difficult because you have to go back to your emotions you know when you want to to show something to to the audience but I'm going to place than into movies so movies you have many chances to to find the right the right emotion that you want to show in in in a play you're in front of people and you have to be there for like an hour and a half Frank Doyle is Rita sighs thank you very much he'll join us in this iconic venue it's great to see it and I want to come and watch you act any time but you want to have stood next to you play in them you did very well against me I wonder what you acted a win there maybe I will come in London and then play made a French play but I will play in Leicester Greinke's are you Frank thank you thank you for joining me on the stand Collingwood shop it was a big honor Samantha Miller here at the Royal Gardens hotel about 2cm rush pick up a prestigious award legends of sport on Russia for a long long time but against him on a few occasions as well and he's such a nice fella you know what a legend is and you wouldn't know it because he's so down to earth when you look at his achievements and what he's done and the medals that is one and everything else and uh you just you know of you know someone to be so grounded as ears and and to have done so much in his career we shared some terrific times or some times memory when we have lost a few games that were very important to us he deserves everything it's coming easily in terms of honors I obviously worked for money as a young man and he was the best striker out of his time and he played for Wales unfortunately Wales haven't made the World Cup but looking forward to the World Cup who do you think it could be a surprise package I'd rather talk about the ones I think we'll do really well I mean I think I think Belgium could do really well not could the shoot with the players of God when they've got some fabulous players that group so far Evander achieved and I think you know Jeremy they always turn up to the big competitions might not going to in great form but no wonder they're in a competition simply grow in strength and then of course the picture from South America they won't be far away either forget the results great honor to jump sauce on the wall in London editing by the Maryland and presenting it to me but for me it's just like I was very very lucky that to be a footballer Jordison which I loved and everything and to get to play for little football will be something very very special you might be retired now but now you're giving a lot back especially to grass roots with your new project tell us a bit about that I think for boys and girls now we need the rights at the grassroots level and if we give them better facilities better equipment smaller I think they'll enjoy a better and I'd like to say if you're not enjoying it you're producing the best ability whatever you do so what we have to do now is give something back to these people and these people that were voluntary they work from nothing and everything can learn you know they're the ones I've deserved of everything I'm honored to be here in order to to watch and see in receive many bigger than the volume is only every four years so as a player you feel there once your repeat plainly playing for your country rather than playing for your club so I always have fond memories because obviously these are guys who played all over Germany all over the world and to come together for four or six weeks and represent the country is always a special thing which teams in particular do you think people would need to look out for and which players well at the end of day it's a you look at everything from the bookies are never far roles you know Brazil Germany a favor smooth out you know and I think well them just a more solid goal of winning grab it's going to be no self American country or a European country think Jersey and Brazil I mean you look up results I don't think of something soccer players don't really know kameena or like you've got some amazing players about a Jimmy again you know when Tina plays Jimmy knows can be very very good food speak Blanchette here for the Stan Collymore show we're at the fabric of football event here in Manchester at the Football Museum we're here to see all the vintage kits from over the years the displays that they're putting on here at the Museum which is your favorite of all the shirts we have here it's difficult to pick one but I have to say obviously the Spanish shirt from for example from the 94 United States World Cup is the first World Cup I I remember when I was a kid so that's special memory for rude if you could have one player's Jersey who would you want from my era I think her mother daughter oh yeah yeah I think he was quite special he was quite unique because because not only me lime when you were first at me like these rivals yeah big rivals but he had something different he was a very nice guy by the way very nice fashioned and I think that he should yeah I would I would take issue I think this is the most beautiful shirt ever yeah I think there is a English team also asked some dorias they could wear it here is an English team that asked who is it here you go and as white shorts and white socks as well they came especially to some Doria to ask for it I think that this is a fantastic shirt it's still the same no fiddling on it no nothing on it and I you know I I really think it's one of the most beautiful ships I completely agree with you on a shirt like this is ugly and I tell you I don't think you can win in gray gray makes you dull well I think that may and I did prove that also and you really don't wanna I don't wanna play anymore I think also England blues lost against the Germans also in gray so gray is not a color to play in here at the Stan Collymore show we continue our look at the group stage of the World Cup in Russia as the focus shifts to group C starring France Leibler joined by fellow Europeans Denmark with Australia and Peru making up the numbers as the teams battle to qualify for the next phase the French are overwhelming favourites to win the group with Atletico Madrid star Antoine Griezmann spearheading the attack but the Danish will offer a credible threat as Christian Eriksen stock continues to rise France were convincing a new wave of qualification scoring 18 goals as they collected 23 points in ten games but they have been known to disappoint at finals when much much more was expected from them however Didier Deschamps is a fan as one of the eight nations to claim a world cup the French know what it takes to win the competition Denmark could strike your front slip up and Ericsson might emerge as one of the surprise stars of the tournament if the Danes progress into the Knockouts the 26 year old has continued to grow at Tottenham Hotspur and his talent befits a global stage as he drives for success with a country that has a population of just 5.7 million Peru currently reside in 11th place in the FIFA World Rankings and was strong in South American qualification as they stopped Alexis Sanchez and Chile from grabbing a playoff berth to reach the finals los incas went on to beat New Zealand over two legs to advance to russia 2018 guru coach ricardo Careca knows how to handle pressure having featured four argentinian super clubs Boca Juniors and River Plate with the sixty-year-old also having managed Brazilian Giants Palmeiras Australia are the ranked outsiders in the group but the soccer rooms have won many fans with their heart and endeavor at the past three World Cup finals Tim Cahill continues to be the inspiration for the Aussies as the country's record goalscorer but the boys from down under will have to be at their very best to survive a stern test against three dangerous opponents next week we'll take a look a
