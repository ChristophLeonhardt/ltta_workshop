1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
Uhh, in the comments below, tell me if my dimple is

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,160
coming through or nahh.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,660
Tova said it was a shadow.
- It is a shadow.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,900
How shady is that? But I think I have about 10 lbs

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,480
to gain before it's an actual, like true

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,080
true and true dimple.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,260
But, that's not important. [laughing] Enjoy the video.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,540
Hey YouTube world, it's me, Evelyn.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,940
I'm coming to you

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,980
eyebrow-less

11
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,500
first and foremost.

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,560
Uhm...

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,580
Eyeliner-less, because the allergy count, fam,

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,860
in Central Texas y'all,

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,160
is...

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,480
ASTRONOMICAL.

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,900
I'm coming to you chapstick-less, to be quite honest.

18
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,540
I just hit a smooth [licks lips], and that's all I did.

19
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,960
Like [licks lip] and then I hopped on the camera.

20
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,940
This is basically an experiment to see if I spontaneously

21
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,160
combust because I don't have eyebrows on camera.

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,280
So, a lot of y'all say things like,

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,280
"Man, you could be talking about a wall and I'd listen."

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,080
That is so flattering, very unhelpful, but so flattering.

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,400
But that reminded me about the time that I actually

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,060
thought there was a ghost in my apartment,

27
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,800
because there was a handprint on my wall.

28
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,460
It was this wall right here.

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,740
I remember one day it was, you know, daylight

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,400
and I'm looking at the wall, and I'm like,

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,640
is that a handprint?

32
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,060
But the thing was, it wasn't like a palm down handprint,

33
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,180
it was just like fingertips, ya know what I mean?

34
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,500
I'm like, who...

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,600
Whose fingertips are those?

36
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,420
I literally go through

37
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,520
months, I go through my whole life,

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,760
thinking that there's a ghost.

39
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,440
And you know, I'm cool with it, nawwmsayin'?

40
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,120
As long...I even like walk around the house just making

41
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,300
declarations to the atmosphere like,

42
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,220
"Hey fam, what's good?

43
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,020
Don't need to see you, really don't need that.

44
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,860
Just letting you know that I don't want none.

45
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,720
You do you, and Imma do me."

46
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,680
My apartment is new. I was the first person to live

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,180
in this apartment, so you know what that means...

48
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,940
Whatever this apartment was built on

49
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,299
[whispering] is the culprit.

50
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,580
Friends would come over, I'd be like,

51
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,700
"Girl, look this handprint. I got a ghost."

52
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,700
It was just a fact of life.

53
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,680
I don't even try to like wash the handprint,

54
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,180
ya know what I'm saying?

55
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,780
You wanted it there, so it's gonna stay there.

56
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,940
I respect your wishes.

57
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,460
It's early or...late at night, early morning, whatever.

58
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,160
Pretty much know the geography of my room,

59
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,600
and of my apartment, so I don't open my eyes

60
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,780
to go to the bathroom. I mean I feel like that's a pretty

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,620
common thing.

62
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,020
I'm navigating and I'm walking, and I trip

63
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,500
because my room's dirty.

64
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,560
And?

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,720
To prevent myself from smashing into the wall

66
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,980
face first,

67
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,880
guess what I did?

68
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,480
Put up my hand,

69
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,980
UGGHH...

70
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,500
like this. Not like this, cause that would hurt my wrist

71
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,100
to just like smash my hand this way into the wall.

72
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,400
So I kinda did this.

73
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,320
[whispering] Oh...

74
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,160
I'm the ghosty!

75
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,400
I had been falling, or I had at least fallen once before,

76
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,620
fell onto the wall,

77
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,380
made the handprint myself.

78
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,860
First of all, what made the handprint?

79
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,580
Why are my fingers so greasy?

80
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,300
Lotion? I don't know.

81
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,020
In the comments below, lemme know if you actually

82
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,260
have any ghost stories.

83
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,480
And i'll see you, girl...

84
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,240
[coughing] whenever.

85
00:03:24,740 --> 00:00:00,000
BYE!
