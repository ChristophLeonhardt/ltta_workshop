a lot of people will ask what's the difference between whiskey and bourbon and the truth is if you look at whiskey whiskey as a category think of it as a big umbrella and underneath this umbrella is all different styles of whiskey so in other words all bourbon is whiskey but not all whiskey is bourbon so if you look under this category single malt scotch is a whiskey bourbon is a whiskey rye is a whiskey generally the differences the differences between the two or between the different variants has to do with the mash bill which is simply the ingredient list or the point of origin bourbon for instance and rye both of those are Native American spirits so the differences between those two are the mash bill and the mash bill is simply the ingredient list used to make it to be a bourbon in America you have to be using 51% or more corn the rest of the mash bill is traditionally rye and malted barley to be a rye whiskey you have to use 51% or more rye and then the rest is usually corn and malted barley in addition both have to be aged in brand-new american oak barrels there's no time period for the the length of time they have to spend in the barrel if you want to call yourself a straight whiskey you have to be aged a minimum of two years Scotch the easy way to know what scotches is it has to be produced in Scotland if you're a cognac you have to invade in the cognac region if you're a champagne you have to be made in the Champagne region it's no difference for Scotch they produce blends they produce single malts single malts can be produced anywhere you can make it in Brooklyn you can make it in Australia but if you want to call yourself a single malt scotch you have to be produced in Scotland
