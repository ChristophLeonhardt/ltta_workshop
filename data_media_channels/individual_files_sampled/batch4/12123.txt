the Senate has released its version of a health care bill and reactions are pouring in make-believe Washington Redskins senator Elizabeth Warren issued a statement saying quote if this bill becomes law everyone who has ever been born will eventually die so many thousands of human beings will live dead on the street at the bloody hands of Republican serial killers it would be like that time the pale-faced set fire to our TVs and chased my tribe into a trail of Tears we must respond by attacking the Capitol on horseback with stolen rifles and tomahawks otherwise the Republicans will just continue pervane the ugly over-the-top rhetoric that leads to violence unquote senator Warren later issued a correction saying she was not in fact a member of the Washington Redskins but did have a featured role in Dances with Wolves as a squaw who gets into Harvard Law School on false pretenses before being killed at Wounded Knee Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also weeded weighed in on the new health care bill sobbing uncontrollably throughout a press conference during which he said in part quote I haven't been able to stop weeping since I pretended to read this bill I just sit on the edge of my bed clutching my rag doll and crying and crying anyone who saw me would be so filled with pity they would never vote for this bill the Statue of Liberty saw me through my bedroom window and began to cry so hard she rusted and now may never get to Oz to ask the wizard for courage unquote the rest of Schumer statement was unintelligible Hillary Clinton who used to be someone or other issued a statement on the Senate health bill after being asked for her opinion by an imaginary reporter she saw on a dream about how she would have won the presidency if it hadn't been for the Russians mrs. Clinton said quote this bill sucks everything sucks the whole country sucks otherwise so help me it would be me traveling around in a helicopter wearing a big red tie unquote mrs. Clinton then knocked back her third martini of the morning and dragged on a cigarette muttering quote misogyny I tell you if it weren't for misogyny that big red tie would be mine unquote former President Barack Bahama or whatever his name is also said something about the bill but who cares finally there have been some attacks on the bill from the right angry conservative concern bit of commentator Hank angry told his listeners quote I'm angry because Republicans promised to repeal Obamacare so they'd get elected then broke their promise so they wouldn't get voted out of office who ever heard of politicians behaving in such a way they should just let Obamacare crash and burn so that millions of Americans suffer we lose our majority and then I can be angry about that which after all is what I do for a living unquote President Trump was unavailable for comment but did send out a tweet saying he was defecting to Russia where the health care was free trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Clavin show really noticing you can't go through the division it's alright we're back after the long Clavin this weekend and the news is tremendous Michael Knowles will

having them sit next to me and we'll share the microphone it's not very highly technological but he will have a bionic arm so that's I don't know maybe maybe I just made that up thing I can't remember

stuff it's good so the the news is actually kind of amazing today actually it's been amazing all week you know things are changing things are really happening and one of the problems with the news is that they focus the news always focuses on events right that's what the news is it's an event something happens but there's also a more general shift taking place I want to talk about that too that I really think is a positive thing at least it has a positive aspect but today we had the Supreme Court reinstated the travel ban the Trump travel ban against several primarily Muslim countries and this is a really positive thing I mean they're going to here have a hearing on it in October they're going to hear the case about the travel ban in October but what they said was the lower courts can't suspend suspend the ban until that hearing takes place by the hearing I'm back I'm going to learn to speak again by the end of the show by the time the hearing takes place Trump will have they said that's all the time they would have needed that's going to be in the fall so that's all the time they need to see what kind of new security measures they need but mostly this is important for just giving a slap in the face to the lower courts who just thought who just joined the resistance to shut down Trump because they don't like Trump and they don't like the way he's thinking and they think they should be in charge of how people think and what the president does so I think we're going to have to have a Trump happiness montage for this I think this is worthy of a Trump happiness montage yes the court has ruled it is let's here we're going to win so much we're going to win at every level we're going to win economically we're going to win with the economy we're going to win with military we're going to win with healthcare and for our veterans we're going to win with every single facet to be my oh my what a wonderful we're gonna win so much you may even get tired of winning here you'll say please please it's too much winning we can't take it anymore I feel pretty oh so pretty I feel pretty and witty and gay we have to keep winning we have to win more I love the Trump happiness montage we haven't had enough chances to use it so we're going to use it liberally and often and you know the news in general is good that you know we now know that Trump isn't under an FBI investigation but Bernie Sanders and his wife they're under investigation because Bernie Sanders wife was running a college and she apparently is she's accused of having misrepresented the college in order to get a loan and there's a possibility that Sanders pressured the bank to get a loan using his position and so that's under investigation Hillary Clinton is under investigation for something she did I can't react off the top my head I can't remember some country where she may have fiddled with the court system and who else Obama is under the Obama people of Loretta Lynch is under investigation for whether she pressured Comey to skewer the email Association everybody's under investigation except for Trump so let's just blown up in the Democrats faces plus we keep losing the Democrats keep losing they lost this loss in Georgia they've been sitting around going oh you know we they're stuck with this Russia thing they're saying they're telling the rank-and-file is telling the leadership stop talking about Russia because we keep losing but they're raising money off the Russia thing and of course the news the the media cover and of course the media now is running the Democrat Party but Chuck Schumer has got a great idea crying Chuck Schumer has now got a great idea that may be the problem the reason they're losing is because of their policies this is some somebody explain this to chuck a they said it really slowly policies Chuck but you've got to listen to this cut from this week talking to George Stephanopoulos it's hilarious this is Chuck describing how they're going to help all those awful deplorable people they don't like thinking about but maybe have a vote for some reason just six Democrats need a strong bold sharp-edged and common-sense economic agenda policy platform message that appeal to the middle class that resonate with the middle class and show that and unites Democrats that's what I've been working on for months and I've been talking to Democrats House and Senate all across the country I've been talking to trump voters I was at a Yankee game Saturday night and I sat next to someone at you know just because that's how the seats where we sit in the grandstand wearing I'm proud to be a deplorable voter a truck driver this economic message platform is going to resonate it's what we were missing and it's not going to be baby steps it's going to be both we're coming out with it this summer within a month you will see it and Democrats will try it legislatively for a year and campaign on a 2018 it's what we were missing in 2016 and in the past we're going to we know that when you lose an election you don't blame other people you blame your Saracen Chuck went to a Yankees game and he met a truck driver this was an exciting revelation for Chuck there it was worth deplorable Trump t-shirt and he just because Chuck you know he always sits in the bleachers so he got to sit next to the deplorable voter a guy wearing a deplorable t-shirt the look of self-satisfaction on his face there you can't see it when he says this he's so pleased with himself that he medic did he talk to him did he ask him any questions I don't know did he buy him a beer anything he doesn't tell us but just the fact that he was sitting next to him just illuminated his mind with this need economic policy we thought we just have to tell people which bathrooms to use we just thought we just had to try to take people's children away to be at them operated on if they wanted to play with dolls you know we didn't realize they wanted some help in their jobs and their work this it's wonderful it's a wonderful thing that is happening to the Democrat Party they are absolutes meanwhile of course the rank-and-file was calling for Pelosi said they're so tired of Nancy Pelosi and abortion purist you know a San Francisco who sells San Francisco values they keep talking about she keeps talking about San Francisco values and then the Republicans use that on their ads Congrats lose anything but there's more more good stuff but before I just want to remind you that Michael Knowles is going to be here to talk about July 4th is coming up and we're going to discuss that but but that comes after the break so if you're on Facebook and YouTube you got to come over to the daily wire.com if you would just subscribe for a lousy eight bucks a month you could have the whole thing you watch the whole thing on the site and the prices are going up on July 1st they're not going up for the people who've already subscribed so this now becomes an intelligence test ok because right now it's only 8 bucks a month and if you subscribe now to remain 8 bucks a month because of July 1st it goes up to I think $15,000 a week and also we come and repossess your car but for that Shapiro will come to your home and tell your husband to man up I may have made that up to the Concord Shore where my imagination end if you subscribe for a year you get Ben's book say it so he wrote it with his dad David about the championship season of the White Sox which is 2005 already fading from memory and never to be repeated ever again a new YouGov poll on trust in the media spelled more bad news for the old guard establishment news organizations I'm reading this news story which once were considered the incorruptible beacons of the truth but are now regarded with widespread skepticism on both sides of the aisle you got found that a total of 70 percent of Americans agree that news organizations report in a biased manner when was the last time he saw a poll in which 70% of Americans agreed on what time it was on anything the one thing we all agree on is the news media stinks and Donald this is a it's the Trump effect it really is this has brought this to the fore he has driven his truck his that truck the Chuck Schumer heard about it at the Yankees game dump has driven it into the rotten structure of this of the media and I think it is a big big deal and I know we have to talk about legislation we'll talk about health care and all that stuff but this is important this matters and here's another thing that matters this from a Wall Street Journal a string of protests on college campuses that shutdownevents hosting conservative speakers has prompted universities around the country to pledge more tolerance for diverse opinions but skeptics say they'll believe it when they see it John Hopkins University announced Thursday a hundred and fifty million dollar effort to facilitate the restoration of open and inclusive discourse the University of California at Berkeley where I graduated and which of course is in the heart of darkness where protesters halted speeches by conservatives Miley innopolis and Ann Coulter is debating bringing in conservative faculty to broaden the spectrum a political discourse on campus the very fact that they are talking about this if they see it through it will be close to a miracle but it would be a wonderful thing about a dozen schools have signed on to a new doctrine from the University of Chicago that puts free speech above concerns about political correctness and look you know they're not doing this because of a love of free discourse and a love of conservatives when they're doing this because the mob is at the gate and the people aren't showing up that people will not send their kids to schools where they're going to face riots and be you know pret there's going to be prejudice against them because they're white all of this is the Trump effect all of this is the fact that Chuck Schumer's is sitting next to a truck driver because he wants to he's sitting next one because he's got to because you realizes they've lost the country all that little that little sliver of land between California and New York turns out to eight these people they hate these people and Trump knows it and they love Trump in the way he talks them to get it they get it all of this stuff is the Trump effect and I think he deserves credit for this and it brings me to this health care bill which is like a stake in many conservatives hearts and I got it I got to stop here and say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube because we're out of yes we are out of time but come on over to the Daily wire com subscribe because on July 1st the rates go up to I think it's $100,000 a year right but yeah oh
