1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,820
It's a bit like an addiction. You've got to
make something, you have to do something.

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,020
It's borderline obsession.

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,720
And every bike we build is my favorite bike at
the time, and as soon as it's done I want

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,740
to build another one.

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,040
Sven Cycles is something I've been thinking about ever since I started cycling in my late teens.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,540
We want bikes that, ultimately, you'll really
enjoy riding.

7
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,260
There's never a bike that's the same. There's always a slight change. And as we build them

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,920
individually as well, they have the marks
of a bike that's built by hand.

9
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,960
Most people I know who cycle have an idea
of their dream bicycle. And it may be an evolving

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,020
idea you've had in your head. We've worked
with a lot of people that have come to us with

11
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,380
sketches, scrapbooks and it's really, really
nice to build something that's just one-off

12
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,520
and unique.

13
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,080
I think a lot of people see a bicycle as two wheels and a frame in the middle.

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,860
There are a lot of subtle changes and nuances in design

15
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,200
which can change the riding characteristics quite dramatically.

16
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,540
I'm a really big fan of modernist architecture and the simplicity of a modernist building

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,220
is really hard to achieve. And with some of our bikes, they may look very simple but

18
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,000
I think people should not underestimate the time and effort that goes in to designing a product.

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,240
Tubing is key to a bike's feel and ride.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,780
Reynolds tubing has been in my life ever
since I can remember.

21
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,900
Growing up, I could never afford a frame manufactured with their tubing. We can now put a badge on our bike

22
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,620
saying, "Manufactured with Reynolds", which is the sort of thing, as a kid, I just wouldn't

23
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,860
have believed was going to happen.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,040
Every part of the bike has a specific tube.

25
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,800
It's not universal.
The first thing we do is get the tubes out

26
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,610
check their correct, check the wall thicknesses,
sand the edges, make sure it's all really

27
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,820
clean because if it's not clean the tubes
won't join together correctly.

28
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,420
We build in steel because I still believe
it's one of the best materials to use.

29
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:26,140
It's been used in bikes since the late 1800s, and they're still using it now for a very good reason.

30
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,000
It's a flexibility we could remove a tube,
replace a tube, repaint the bike and you wouldn't

31
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,280
know it was damaged.

32
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,900
I just like working with it, it's very sculptural.

33
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,930
This isn't aerospace precision engineering.
It's a steel ruler and a marker. So when we're

34
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,400
cutting the tubes it's within a mil or two.

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,060
But what we're trying to do is take the best
from bicycle building in the past and add

36
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,320
a little bit of modern flair to it.

37
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,170
There's various techniques for building bicycles.
We do a thing called fillet brazing, where

38
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:06,450
you connect the pipe together. We use a bronze
rod and a flame, we heat the tubes up to the

39
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,660
same temperature and we fill the joint with
bronze and it gives a very sort of

40
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,900
fluid lovely, quite sculptural feel.

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,360
You've just got to practice. You've got to be able to judge material temperatures, you got to just look at it

42
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,100
and you just get a feel for it.

43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,700
It's the stage where your tubes start to look a bit like a bicycle.

44
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,239
My father's a jeweller. He would make very pretty things, which are lovely but for me

45
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,049
they don't really have any function. What
I love about bicycles is you can start on

46
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:43,520
Monday with a box of tubes and you can be riding it by the weekend.

47
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,160
And it can last you for the rest of your life.

48
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,680
Outside of the frame or forks, the other most
important part is the wheels and tires.

49
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,740
When you build the wheel you have to lace them. So there's little holes going all the way around

50
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,349
the rim, you poke the spoke through.

51
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:08,340
We build all our wheels by hand here because a machine can't get 30 years' worth of wheel-building experience.

52
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,040
Color is very personal. With any of our bikes, you can have them painted whatever color you want.

53
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,100
We've matched one to a teapot so we can get that scanned and we can match that,

54
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,240
or someone's favourite item of clothing.

55
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,300
I like to let the bike sit for four or five
days minimum just so the paint can

56
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,980
have time to cure a little bit, and then we assemble it.

57
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,280
We get out all the new components and it's a case of putting them together.

58
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,940
Some bikes you can assemble in three hours, some would take three days.

59
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,900
We've built bikes that cost in the ten thousand pound plus mark.

60
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,500
Some people, they're saving up, and this is their bike and they're going to own it for

61
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,560
the rest of their life so we just want to
make sure we get the right thing.

62
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,900
I think the bike for me was the first time
I had some freedom. So as soon as I had one

63
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,180
I was off.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,680
A lot of people still get that thrill when they were a kid blasting down a hill

65
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,680
wind going through their hair. It's fun.

66
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,140
Everyone has their favorite jacket or something that just makes them feel good.

67
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,460
If you've got a bike that fits well you actually feel part of it.

68
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,620
Building bicycles as a creative outlet is fantastic.

69
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,350
It's not something you do because you're going
to get a big pay check at the end of the day.

70
00:05:27,350 --> 00:00:00,000
You do it because you have a passion for it.
