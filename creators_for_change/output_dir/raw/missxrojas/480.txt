dollars one way and if I were to get

39
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,990
like a taxi to the metro and all that is

40
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,780

lot of writing as well but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I</font>

49
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,479
say I'm tired of that for now and so any

50
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,180
other text would be much appreciated the

51
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,070
other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been watching</font>

52
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,750
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> project for some videos as you</font>

53
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,340
may remember the thing you didn't really

54
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">load for me because I'm on here and the</font>

55
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,119
internet isn't wonderful but I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

56
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,979
watching back most the videos and almost

57
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,920
all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and it really reminds me</font>

58
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,209
of the experience of watching children

59
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,979
in need and comic relief growing up as a

60
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,379
child I don't know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

61
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:13,780
relate to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

62
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,030
tool I don't know whether they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do</font>

63
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,200
that in other countries whether it's

64
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,580
that's just a British thing but the

65
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,580
children<font color="#E5E5E5"> need programs like they started</font>

66
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,100
probably seven and they go on until well

67
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,600
after midnight and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise money they</font>

68
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,550
raid millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pounds each year and</font>

69
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,650
pledges and it's incredible and people

70
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,209
do crazy things and stupid things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

71
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:33,850
raise money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> funny seeing</font>

72
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,130
that a kind of mirror of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or echo of</font>

73
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,470
that in project for awesome but it being

74
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,060
almost entirely of people I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font>

75
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,700
like without the backing of the BBC<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

76
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,750

78
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,550
makes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> cry every time and no slightly</font>

79
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,569
emotionally unstable at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>
