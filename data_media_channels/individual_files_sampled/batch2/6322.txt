so you might remember Charlie Hebdo their controversial magazine in France and they do often times controversial cartoons on their front page and inside the magazine now they're very famously drew Mohammed on their cover several times and we're attacked for it although apparently some right-wingers have forgotten that but now they have a very controversial one against what I guess they think is the right wing in Texas as the flooding has happened in Houston and and the nearby areas but they didn't call him right-wing they called him and showed him as Nazis the translation of that is God exists he drowned all the neo-nazis of Texas now that is super harsh I don't agree with that of course and we don't know the politics of the people who have passed away or have been displaced and a lot of them are poor and they're from all different backgrounds white black Latino it the storm did not discriminate it hit one and all in that sense and and so this is obviously distasteful and obviously the wrong way to go but it's interesting to note that when they attacked Muslims in ways that Muslims found offensive they were lauded and celebrated in fact I remember Ross Douthat from New York Times a survey writer had at the time said the right to blaspheme and otherwise give offense is essential to the liberal order the right wing is now up in arms over this cover and they don't find it to be essential to the liberal order to have a cover like this anymore at the time Ross had also said clearly serves a free societies greater good to do these kind of offensive covers now that we are offended and we are and I am all of a sudden no it's not for society's better good you attack Muslims and you offend them Bravo Bravo you do it to right-wing Americans in Texas that no not Bravo terrible okay so look I think we should be consistent on that I I think during the Prophet Muhammad is perfectly acceptable charlie hebdo is not Muslim if you don't want to draw the Prophet Muhammad because you're Muslim that's your religion it's not our religion on the other hand we we should treat their equal-opportunity offensiveness the same no matter what the situation is and obviously people do not do that certainly the right wing in their rage and their support of them when they attack Muslims and in their rage against them when they attack what they perceive as right-wingers in Texas has been very disparate speaking of which we go to one more right winger this guy Believe It or Not used to be United States congressman joe walsh tweeted french rag Charlie Hebdo mocks Harvey victims as neo-nazis Charlie Hebdo makes fun of everyone but Muslims cowards oops that is monumental ignorance of course Charlie Hebdo the main thing they're known for is doing the cartoonists of Mohammed in fact this was one of their famous covers where they drew Mohammed and they not only were attacked there was a fire bombing of their headquarters in 2011 but then in very famously worldwide attention in January of 2015 when there was more Muslim radicals that attacked them 12 people were killed in charlie hebdo's offices during that attack to say that they don't attack Muslims is preposterous to say that they are cowards I mean there might be a lot of things in distasteful is high on that list but cowards they are not so God try to get your facts right just a tiny bit before you go screaming into the abyss qit membership gets your commercial-free young turks downloaded stream at podcasts that get all the network shows and support independent media TYT Network comm slash join
