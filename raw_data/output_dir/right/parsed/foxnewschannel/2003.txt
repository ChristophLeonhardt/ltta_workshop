THE U.S. HAS BEEN IN
CONSULTATION WITH ITS ALLIES
ABOUT A NEW DEAL IN THOSE
CONSULTATIONS WILL RESUME
TOMORROW MORNING.
>> Shepard: WE WILL BE BACK TO
YOU IN A MOMENT.
AT FIRST, JOHN ALTERMAN AT THE
STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL
STUDIES NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION.
HE ALSO STARRED IN THE STATE
DEPARTMENT UNDER
PRESIDENT GEORGE FW HW BUSH.
FIRST OF ALL, YOUR INITIAL
ACTION TO WHAT HAPPENED >> >>
-- A REACTION TO WHAT HAPPENED?
>> FIRST OF ALL, HE SAID WE ARE
CLEARLY.
THE DEAL DOESN'T HAVE A WAY TO
WITHDRAW.
AND I HAD TO GO TO THE TREASURY
DEPARTMENT WEBSITE TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT JOHN ROBERTS JUST
EXPLAINED, THERE IS A 90 DAY
WINDOW AND I 180 DAY WINDOW.
I THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT WOULD BE
MORE IN THE WEEDS ON WHAT HE WAS
DOING, HE JUST SAID, WE ARE DONE
WITH THIS DEAL.
>> Shepard: IT WHEN YOU SAID
IT, YOU ARE DONE WITH IT, DID
THIS DEAL OFFER A WAY TO PULL
OUT OF ITSELF, OR ARE WE JUST
SAYING THAT WE ARE GOING TO
VIOLATE THE DEAL?
THE RULES ON US FOR THE
FOLLOWING, AND NOW WE ARE
CHANGING THEM?
SPEAK TO THE DEAL DIDN'T HAVE A
PROVISION FOR WITHDRAWAL.
WE ARE ESSENTIALLY SAYING WE ARE
WILLFULLY WITHDRAWING.
THE DEAL DOES HAVE A WAY FOR THE
IRANIANS TO COMPLAIN THAT WE ARE
NOT COMPLYING, WHETHER THEY GO
THAT WAY OR NOT, I DON'T KNOW.
IT SEEMS THAT OUR EUROPEAN
ALLIES HAVE A LOT OF HARD
DECISIONS TO MAKE ABOUT HOW THEY
ARE TREATING THE UNITED STATES.
I THINK COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND
RUSSIA WERE PARTIES TO THE DEAL
BUT HAVE THEIR OWN DEAL WITH THE
UNITED STATES SEE SOME
OPPORTUNITIES.
I THINK FRANKLY, IRAN MAY SEE
SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY TO
SPLIT THE UNITED STATES FROM ITS
ALLIES IN MANY WAYS WHICH MAY BE
THEIR FIRST BEST COURSE GOING
FORWARD.
>> Shepard: IT LOOKS LIKE THE
PRESIDENT HAS JUST ANNOUNCED
THAT HE WILL NEGOTIATE -- HE HAS
ORDERED HIS FOREIGN LEADERS TO
NEGOTIATE WITH OTHER PARTIES TO
THIS DEAL.
THEN HE SAID SOMEWHAT
THREATENINGLY, IF NEGOTIATIONS
FAIL, THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC WILL
ENRICH >> URANIUM MORE THAN
BEFORE...
IN NEXT WEEKS.
OUR >> WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF
THAT?
>> John: I THINK THE IRANIANS
ARE TRYING TO SHOW THAT THEY
HAVE A STRONG HAND, THEY ARE NOT
WEAK AND THEY ARE NOT SCARED.
THEIR ECONOMY, FRANKLY, WITH ALL
OF THEIR OIL IS ABOUT THE STATE
OF SIZE OF THE STATE OF
MARYLAND.
IT'S NOT A GLOBAL SUPER POWER
HOUR AND THEY ARE COMING UP
AGAINST MUCH STRONGER COUNTRIES.
AGAIN, I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS
A HARD TASK AHEAD OF HIM, AND
THE U.S. JUST WITHDREW THE
SANCTIONS THAT APPLIED TO OTHER
COUNTRIES, SECONDARY SANCTIONS.
IT'S STILL ILLEGAL FOR AMERICANS
TO DO BUSINESS WITH IRAN,
WHETHER OTHER COUNTRIES WILL GO
ALONG WITH THE REPOSSESSION OF
AMERICAN SAINT >> SANCTIONS,
UNDER THIS CONTEXT WHEN THE
PRESIDENT JUST SAID WE COULD
HAVE HAD A BETTER DEAL, I THINK
REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW THE
FRENCH DECIDE TO PLAY THIS, THE
BRITISH AND THE GERMANS, LET
ALONE THE CHINESE AND THE
RUSSIANS.
I THINK WILL BE A VERY
INTERESTING SEVERAL MONTHS AHEAD
WHEN IT COMES TO IRAN POLICY.
>> Shepard: I'M OUT OF TIME,
BUT BEFORE WE GO, INTERNALLY IN
IRAN, THE HARD LEADER OF THAT
ISLAMIC STATE, THERE HAS BEEN
EXTREME PUSH AND PULL AND
FRICTION WITHIN THE COUNTRY ON
WHO WILL HAVE CONTROL OF THIS
GOVERNMENT.
WHAT EFFECT DOES THIS HAVE ON
THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THE MORE
HARDLINERS.
I WOULDN'T CALL HIM A MODERATE,
I WOULD CALL HIM A PRAGMATIST.
I THINK HE WAS ANGRY AT IRAN AND
HELPED UNITE THE WORLD TO PUT
THE SANCTIONS ON IRAN THAT
BROUGHT THEM TO THE JCPOA.
>> Shepard: BUT IT INTERNALLY,
WHAT DID HE    THAT GET HIM?
WHAT DOES THIS DO TO THE MAN WE
WERE NEGOTIATING WITH INSIDE OF
IRAN AND HOW DOES THAT AFFECT
THE WORLD STAGE?
SPEAK TO I DON'T THINK HE WAS
EVER OUR FRIEND, I THINK HE WAS
A PRAGMATIST, WHETHER HE WANTS
TO BE A PRAGMATIST WHO WANTS TO
RAISE TENSIONS, I DON'T THINK HE
IS A MODERATE
