Russian athletes who are willing to take part in the upcoming Winter Games as neutrals will have the full support of the Russian Olympic Committee the decision comes after the Olympic Chiefs banned Russia from the tournament for alleged state-sponsored doping Arty's Nicky Aaron joins me now with the details well hi there Nicky so it looks like Russia's not going to boycott the games then that's right in the last hour or so the Russian Olympic Committee revealed a unanimous decision to grant their blessings to any athletes still wanting to compete in the Olympic Games the Winter Olympic Games which will be held in less than two months as you know in Pyeongchang sales career they will be competing as neutrals though so no Russian flags no Russian symbols no Russian anthem and effectively no Team Russia they'll be referred to as OAS or Olympic athletes from Russia now the IOC said that there are still details that need to be ironed out with the International Olympic Committee concerning things such as you know what uniform the Russian team will be wearing they also said that they reached this decision after hearing the thoughts and concerns of each individual involved in the Olympic team from the coaches to the athletes and most of them said you know despite everything they've been through over the over recent months they'd still want the chance to live out their dream here's one of those athletes commentators won't be saying that an athlete is from the International Olympic Committee or an athlete is competing under the International Olympic Committee's flag that's wrong anyway they will say that an athlete came from Russia so the name will be heard yes there won't be our uniform or our anthem but it will still be our Russian medal our people competing for our country the main words are our country Russia and these medals will anyway return to Russia I wish our guys will do what no one expects us to do that is to win and this decision comes less than a week after the President Vladimir Putin also gave His blessing to any athlete still watching to compete he said that Russia fully supports them well how will the Olympic officials decide who to invite well I'm sorry to say Kate is not going to be clear sailing for these athletes who still want to take part in the games in February they still have to be officially invited by the International Olympic Committee there's a number of points they have to comply with possibly even sitting more doping tests as well and the president of the ROC Alexander Zhukov also raised concerns that there may be even bigger roadblocks to come when our users thought one of the main issues of concern is whether all our leading athletes will get an invitation to the Olympics so it won't just be those with less chance of winning medals that go where as leading athletes will have to remain at home would be very strange and surprising I hope that the International Olympic Committee is interest in the strongest Russian athletes taking part in the games now just to recap how we got to this point the decision to ban Russian athletes followed an investigation by an IOC backed Commission headed by the former head of the Swiss department of sport also the former president of the country Samuel Schmidt and that report actually highlighted reasonable doubt that any of the suggestions that any knowledge of possible doping in Russia went any higher than the National Sports Association take a listen nevertheless the independent and impartial evidence do not allow the IOC DC to establish with certitude either who initiated or who headed this scheme on many occasions reference was made on the involvement at the minister of sports level but no indication independent or impartial evidence appeared to corroborate any involvement or knowledge at a higher level of the state so of course there are bystanders claiming that this whole decision is politicized there's also people claiming that's the whole investigation latch transparency but surely no one can deny the courage that in the guts that these athletes have to still be standing after everything they've been through think about the athletes from other countries who have been so focused on their training when the Russian team have had to go through this emotional rollercoaster and they're still willing to to make it to Pyeongchang no matter what and also heaven knows what kind of reception awaits them when they make it if they make it to Pyeongchang you know how will they be treated by the other athletes from other countries how will the crowds and the the viewers around the world respond if they do win a medal and it's gonna be really difficult to watch if they do win a medal they have to stand on that podium and be denied the right of listening to their national anthem it's gonna be really difficult viewing and also the clock is ticking you know a matter of weeks to go and they're one step closer to the games but still so many hurdles get to clear indeed so short time to go but still a long way to go Arty's Nikki Aaron thank you
