"Nice to hear the kids on the
first day back to school
Day 2 on the cycle in the
Winnipeg downtown.
It’s nine degrees.
At the airport it’s just two."
 "O Canada, we
stand on guard for thee.
O Canada, we stand
on guard for thee."
"All right.
Good morning, everyone.
E.A.L. and learning how to
speak and practice English
is a big part of
why you’re here.
And so it’s the
first day of school.
Sometimes it’s a
little bit challenging."
"No.
Oh my God."
"Hi.
Welcome.
Come on in.
How are you?
Good.
Come on in.
Well, I think what
I’d like to do
to get started is to give
you a little questionnaire
to fill out.
The first question says, 'Do
you have brothers or sisters
and if so, how many?'"
"Do you want a break?"
"O.K."
"Do you want to take a
break and try again?
Looks good."
"So are you going to start
stretching more at home?"
"I will try."
"Yeah?"
"Because it’s better if you
do it every day, right?"
"Mm."
"One."
"O.K."
"Hi.
My name is Sara.
My  number is 85002.
I’ll be your interpreter.
How may I assist you?"
"I’m treating Suleiman’s
son for physiotherapy,
and I was wondering if
you’d be able to interpret
a question that he has for me."
"Yeah, sure."
"What are the chances that the
leg is going to get longer?"
"So is there like a hope that
maybe 10%, 50% of the leg
would get longer?"
"I don’t think so.
The orthopedic surgeon
would be a better person
to ask about the
long-term bone growth."
"Thank you very much to the
interpreter and to you."
"Good afternoon .
All students should be in
their afternoon classes."
"Mustafa al .
Not here yet.
Ibraheem?
Ibraheem?"
"Ibraheem, yes."
"Ibraheem.
What is the word we would use
to describe big countries?"
"Huge?"
"How do we measure big?"
"I don’t know, America."
"There’s a word called area.
Do you know what area is?"
"Yeah."
"So area is a
measurement of size.
So when we talk about
Canada being big,
there’s a lot of
area, a lot of space."
"But there is no people."
"In Canada."
"Only 30 millions, yeah."
"So we’re the second biggest
country in the world.
Shouldn’t that mean that we’re
the second most populated?"
"What words do you know
to describe family?
If you just raise
your hand and tell me.
Yes?"
"Like a tree."
"So like a tree."
"You can work on this, Ibraheem,
10 things about your family.
O.K.?
If that’s too hard, and I
understand that that might be,
you can just leave this alone.
O.K.?"
