the brutal facts of war a boy is rescued a baby gasps Pereira she's pulled out of rubble both of them in Syria but it's a scene replicated in many parts of the world we ask why are more children than ever being killed or injured in war and what can be done about it this is Inside Story hello and welcome to the program I'm Martine Dennis from Syria to Afghanistan and Somalia wherever there's conflict and instability it's often children who suffer the most one out of every six children in the world is living in war zones that's according to a new report by the charity Save the Children it says those who are lucky enough to survive an attack are often left with debilitating lifelong injuries if that weren't enough some aid workers in war zones have been accused of abusing the very same people they're meant to protect we have a lot to get to with our guests first so neve barker sets up our discussion war destroys lives it traumatizes communities and in many of the world's conflict zones children are suffering the most this is eastern guter a suburb of the Syrian capital Damascus last week its faceful endless bombardment after years of starve and surrender tactics the human rights groups safe the children believes youngsters in war zones are now more at risk than at any time in the past 20 years according to a new report by the organization one in six of the world's children live in conflict zones that's 357 million children a seventy five percent increase since the early 1990s Syria Afghanistan and Somalia are the three most dangerous conflict affected countries to be a child in the past few years there's been a 300% increase in UN verified cases of killing and maiming of children and around half of all children in conflict zones like access to schools and health facilities many of these children in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Kasai region count violence among their earliest memories militia have destroyed schools and homes across the region and the UN says thousands of children have been forced to become soldiers save the children's one of several organizations trying to rehabilitate victims the things we're talking about in this report to children being raped children being forced to fight children being forced to kill other children horrifying brutality and so there's a number of things we can do we can invest better in mental health and psychosocial support for children in disaster zones we can rebuild the society around them get them back into school reunite them with their families there's a whole range of things we can do but that does take investment it takes time and it takes support despite greater international standards when it comes to protecting children increasingly brutal tactics are being employed the widespread use of indiscriminate weapons cluster and barrel bombs have seen child casualty numbers saw this nine-year-old Ranger girl was shot three times whilst fleeing Myanmar children are not simply caught in the crossfire they are targets a group say the profound psychological impact of conflict on children cannot be underestimated there are things seen in childhood that can take a lifetime to recover from Nev Barker al-jazeera let's introduce our guests now in London we have George Graham director of humanitarian policy at Save the Children in Birmingham in the center of the UK we have preached Gill whose shadow minister of international development welcome to you both George let me start with you because it is your report that we're using to launch our conversation into this area and there's a certain inevitability about what you point out Save the Children says that children are being affected by conflict it was ever thus wasn't it certainly true that children have been affected by conflict for as long as conflict has been a thing that happens but what we've seen in the last 25 years is a really significant increase in the numbers of children living in conflict zones so by 3/4 has been an increase since the early 90s and looking at the UN data there are some really disturbing trends so three times as many children are reportedly being killed or maimed that is disabled or injured severely during conflict and an astonishing 15 times more than 15 times more incidents of aid being deliberately blocked by parties to conflict that means children not getting the food they need or the health care that they need as a deliberate act of war and that's since 2010 so that's a pretty big trend we think so it is indeed worth pointing out we're describing it is what do we attribute it's one of the biggest outrageous of our time okay so why is this happening so it's happening for a few reasons one one issue is the conflict is increasingly taking place in cities and that means that there are people much more densely populated together children are much more exposed to the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects and we're doing some asset per piece of research that's looking at the particular harm that is caused to children's much smaller bodies by by blast injuries and that's really one of the drivers of the high rates of killing and maiming but we're also seeing a real culture of impunity there is the body of international law the laws of war human rights law that set standards for how conflict should be to be fought and we're seeing far too often the standards are not being upheld and your job I wanted to ask you a little bit more about that what are specifically the standards that apply to the well-being of children in conflict so the UN has codified a set of violations grave violations they called of children's rights in conflict and so they include the prohibition against indiscriminately killing children injuring children also recruiting them into armed groups targeting them for sexual violence attacking their schools and as I mentioned earlier blocking humanitarian access those are all identified grave violations and they're all things that are currently being currently been perpetrated right now in really quite a few conflicts around the world and I'm pleased to say that we can now introduce Jan Egeland who is the secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council he's joining us via Skype from Goma in eastern DRC Yann Eglin thanks for joining us and of course where you are is one of the locations of persistent conflict so presumably you can tell us firsthand about the situation with regard to children in the conflict there a man shot freely what I've seen today in the last two three days here in eastern Congo because it centers on violence against children and women there are in this province alone I'm now in North kevo in eastern Congo there is more than 1.2 million internally displaced and they are mostly women and children there are a hundred and twenty armed groups what they do all of them is to pray on the civilian population what's more of the problem is that there is not international attention not international response the few humanitarian agencies here including NRC are totally overwhelmed and totally underfunded and presumably we're helping too few people into a few places Janna gerland earlier George of Save the Children jested that the increasingly high number of children affected by conflict was as a consequence of there being more conflict in urban centers that isn't the case so in eastern DRC where you are is it in the Congo it's not it's really in the countryside with women children suffer alone because there are two q8 what is able to each then we could do much more if we had resources and willingness to go okay and pre-killed that brings us neatly to you as somebody in opposition in the British Parliament but somebody who will have an input in terms of policy of aid giving for Britain towards issues like have been outlined by both Georgian and Yan and what is the current thinking in the UK with regard to humanitarian aid especially of course given the backdrop of the Oxfam scandal so firstly I'm really appalled to hear the new statistics on children in conflict and it's really concerning because if you look at Yemen it's appalling that on one hand we spend almost 200 million in aid of British taxpayers money but then we continue to you know sell over 3 billion of arms to Saudi Arabia and you know it's it's giving with one hand and taking away with the other and labor has said that the UK has got to stop these arms sales right now and where children are at risk in places like Syria Yemen Maya Maya Mar it's clear that we need political solutions as well as humanitarian ones and the UK has got a real Peele key role I would say on the UN Security Council and with governments especially in in of Donald Trump's turning inwards there's a real void in diplomatic leadership and consensus building and I think it's great to see that Labour is talking about having a policy coherence across government we think so we think we can think about the impact on children in conflict when we shape not just our trade policies but our foreign policy all right defense policy and that's something that labor alright I'm limited let me let me jump in there because this is a good moment for us to look a little bit more closely at the current humanitarian aid environment because those getting the help that they need is an even tougher quest at the moment like for instance as you've already heard the US president Donald Trump has slashed his foreign aid by around nine billion dollars in the latest budget that's down by a whopping twenty five percent and the UN agency for Palestinians Anwar is already being affected an international donor conference to rebuild Iraq just this week could only raise around thirty billion dollars that was a third of what it actually needed and to make matters worse as already mentioned there are questions about some of those who work on the ground in conflict zones they're increasingly coming under scrutiny like in the sket sex scandal involving Oxfam and that has got age agencies across the board fearing that it could lead to major cuts in funding so coming back to you then young Eagle and you've already identified the fact that the the humanitarian aid environment if you like is so dismal at the moment that nobody seems is able to raise the amount of money that they need for emergency funding yeah and I think it's a shame really we spend more on ice cream in the world than we spend on humanitarian assistance we have these phenomenal Olympics where we can spend you know sports events and then we're not able to raise the money for women children who are the brink of dying because of neglect because of lack of assistance and lack of our protection and would be the ultimate insult to the women abused sexually and gang-raped by the armed groups here that donors cut assistance because some really bad colleagues did something really dumb and George coming to you do you accept that perhaps NGOs and aid workers themselves take a little bit of the responsibility for this that this lack of enthusiasm if you like for humanitarian give humanitarian giving largely because there's an awful lot of opacity is that there in in in the aid industry if you like it's not terribly clear and transparent yeah we think we have to accept that if if the thing is clear that there are sections of our publics that are losing confidence in what we do then that's on us we need to win that trust back and particularly this week I mean I like Y and like everybody I think was not only shocked by the stories that we saw coming out but also quite angry because because what that guy was doing in Haiti and probably or perhaps other bad guys in other places might be doing is the exact opposite of what we exist to do so it's really mission critical that we get on top of that those sorts of incidences of harassment and exploitation and make sure that we have a culture of zero tolerance that's part of what we need to do to to win the trust it's a secure re-secure I guess and the trust that we depend on actually from from our publics but then as Yan's been have been getting at the the scale of need in the world is out of all of our control and it is growing and so we're in this difficult position where there's a general loss of confidence in in formerly well trusted institutions against a backdrop of really severely increasing need so we need to close that gap pretty quickly and preet coming to you as a prospective Minister in government you would hope of course how would to approach this whole issue differently currently we understand that the British government is reviewing its its funding of Oxfam that's the agency at the center of many of these allegations but how would labour do differently so I come from a background of being in Child Protection I also worked with UNICEF and street children in Delhi and labor are really really concerned about what's come out from the abuse scandal around Oxfam and but what's really important is that we keep some perspective around this we know that the sector needs reform and we need to be working with the sector and that's what we would be committed to do at the end of the day the cover-up that's come out is very very concerning and what I want is that actually all of the aged agencies working in this sector should feel confident and comfortable enough to come out and actually talk about some of the issues that may be apparent in their organisations as well and we need to have an honest and transparent conversation about what reform means we as Britain have got an absolute duty globally around child protection and we must work with other countries and also the United Nations but also Interpol and make sure that what comes out of this is a very robust system that builds confidence not just here but internationally and making sure that these little things don't happen again in the future and young Eggland's what would you attribute this current lack of interest in humanitarian giving to is it just a consequence of the current scandals that are plaguing the sector or does it go deeper than that I'm afraid we've lost Yan for now but let's continue and hopefully we'll be able to get the link back to ya Nagaland who is in eastern DRC let's go back to George and George Yan was Yama's starting to tell us about something more deeper and deeper malaise that is affecting the sector that is leading to generally to a downturn in the fount of humanitarian aid being given primarily from countries because it's government's isn't it that do the heavy lifting when it comes to this area yeah a piece ID cautious of describing it as a malaise because actually humanik the spend on humanitarian aid has been increasing over time it's just that the needs are outpacing that increase and obviously we yet to see what impact Donald Trump's decisions might have on the overall a flows but that's until until recently it's been increasing but I think the point yam was was I think trying to make or it was going to make was was that was just to re-emphasize I guess that that the need is really just getting getting greater at a scale I think none of us foresaw I keep thinking back to 2011 when we were working on food crises really shocking food crisis and farming actually in Somalia and so we were thinking a lot about how to tackle the problem of hunger and we really weren't thinking that much about how to tackle the problem of conflict and then in late 2011 early 2012 we started to see one-by-one countries going to war or war or war returning to those countries so South Sudan Syria Yemen Libya Iraq research resurgence of violence northern Nigeria and many of those companies that all of those conflicts have persisted so we've seen over the last what is that eight seven years we've seen we've seen a large number of really nasty really protracted Wars going on and on and on creating really untold humanitarian need and one of the most disturbing things I think we've heard in recent weeks recent days really is about Syria where we used to talking about Syria in catastrophic language saying you can't imagine anywhere worse and yet now we're hearing people who are closer than I am to what's going on on the ground saying it has not been worse in Syria than it is right now so this is the context we're dealing with it's it's desperately sad but it requires all of our efforts to get behind the pump and really to try to make the biggest difference we can both through our aid and as pre to say through political engagement um and I was gonna go back to yarn but I think we might have lost him again but preached in the meantime while we're trying to Savage contact with yon preach I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on this issue of humanitarian diplomacy which is something that yang Eglin talks about quite a lot and he says that quite at the moment humanitarian diplomacy is at an all-time low George has already made reference to some of the areas in Syria for instance that are being besieged by one set of forces or another and that they are simply not allowing in life-giving assistance I mean this is rock-bottom isn't it in terms of the Syrian conflict absolutely and it's really really important that we work across departments and so working with our foreign affairs team working with the international trade arm as well and defense to look at how we can work with partners and other global leaders to absolutely you know make the case for making sure that blockades are lifted and that Aid is getting to where it needs to be where it needs to go and so George do you feel that there is any scrap of optimism at the moment I mean we've painted a pretty miserable picture haven't we 375 million kids around the world are living in conflict zones and that is not a 75 percent increase on the 1990s I mean which way are we heading well actually it is a bleak picture but but I'm optimistic I kind of have to be optimistic because this is this is our role in the world as aid workers is to try to and try to help children in the case of Save the Children have a brighter future and I do believe that that's possible and part of the reason I believe that is because I think that I think firstly on the point of where the public is out on this actually no we've been talking a bit about a malaise and a loss of trust but really most members of public certainly in my country in the UK genuinely care about the suffering of children and we know that because every time there's a major appeal the British public responds with incredible generosity so I feel that there's a human connection there that is still very strong and pretty meaningful secondly I think the government's are starting to realize that this sort of beggar my neighbor approach has as as push the bar lower and lower and lower if you like so that standards are not being upheld so well I guess what I'm getting at is that if lots of governments again such as the British government talk about the importance of a rules-based international system and it's this very grand rhetoric but they need to be seen to be upholding that in their practice consistently without fear or favor if they do that fine they won't stop the real bad guys but they will stop other governments from thinking maybe they can get away with committing violations it will raise the bar they'll make it clearer when a state or a non-state actor is in breach of international accepted standards and that will make it easier to take action so I feel I feel like that's something that's a corner that is being turned and will be turned and it's a reason to be optimistic and preach you can't really escape the politics can you because without an end to the conflict actually nothing is going to get that much better is it for that for the children of these conflict zones and indeed other vulnerable groups like like women like the elderly like the disabled so then it's got to translate into policy hasn't it foreign policy particularly of course because you're part of the British establishment a British foreign policy how far do you think that what Britain does on the Security Council for instance will have a benign effect on this dreadful situation that we've been hearing about yeah I think you know it's the point that I made earlier about working across government so it's not just about the international development and you know it's tipps spearheading this sort of vision and campaign in terms of ending conflict it's got to be with the foreign affairs team working together to make sure our policy doesn't contradict on one hand giving and on the other hand you know actually supporting regimes in situations like this so I think there's a real opportunity though to work with like-minded leaders across the globe to make sure that there is that kind of commitment towards aid and development I mean I'm really proud of this country we have no point not 7% and like George said a lot of people especially my constituency but most people I speak to absolutely make the case for aid and we need to be working more closely with our diaspora community because actually communities that have been here for a long time from the Commonwealth for example have actually been doing their own type of aid back home and in areas of conflict we're seeing lots more people coming together and we need to make that strong case and we need to be holding the UN Security Council we need to have a very strong voice there and making the case again about how do cross how do we work cross departments how do we work with our defense teams and look at our policy around defence where it impacts on vulnerable communities especially women and young you know children in conflict situations thanks to all our guests then George Graham director of humanitarian policy at Save the Children preach Gill UK shadow minister of international development and joining us from Gomer in the Democratic Republic of Congo secretary-general the Norwegian Refugee Council
