imagine if you could build a tunnel that sliced through the center of the earth suddenly you could travel to opposite ends of our planet with ease simply hop into the tunnel and let gravity whisk you towards your destination initially gravity's pole would accelerate you down toward the Earth's center but as you pass through the core gravity would start to work against you here's how long it would take you to reach the other side first you must create a vacuum by removing all air out of the tunnel otherwise friction in the form of air resistance will slow you down to much an air pressure near the center would crush you to death next you'll need to wear a spacesuit which will protect you against the intense heat at the core and supply you oxygen to breathe after removing the air and suiting up you could freefall through the vacuum tunnel assuming the force of gravity is constant throughout your trip it would take about 19 minutes for you to reach Earth's center you would be blazing along at 25,000 miles per hour or 32 times the speed of sound but you would feel completely weightless just like an astronaut in space it's passed through the core your speed would slow down but your momentum would continue to propel you upward against gravity by the time you reach the other end you would be back to a walking pace total the trip would take about 38 minutes that certainly beats a 40 hour plane ride from Santiago Chile Xian China
