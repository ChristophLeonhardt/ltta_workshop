ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
COMPONENTS OF ANY FUNCTIONING
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS OR SYSTEM IS
TO SUPPORT AND APPLAUD POLITICAL
ACTIVISM, POLITICAL RHETORIC.
IT
IS IMPORTANT TO DO THAT.
BUT
LAURA INGRAHAM DOESN'T SEEM TO
SUPPORT IT.
IN FACT RECENTLY SHE
DID SOME COMMENTARY IN REGARD TO
LEBRON JAMES'S STATEMENT ABOUT
DONALD TRUMP.
ESPN DID A SPECIAL
SEGMENT WHERE CERTAIN NBA
PLAYERS WERE INTERVIEWED ABOUT
POLITICAL ISSUES, AND HERE IS
WHAT LEBRON JAMES HAD TO SAY AND
HOW MUCH LAURA INGRAHAM HATED
IT.
TAKE A LOOK.
>>THIS IS A DUMB JOCK ALERT.
NBA
SUPERSTAR LEBRON JAMES IS
TALKING ABOUT POLITICS AND ITS
R-RATED, HERE IS HIS BARELY
INTELLIGIBLE TAKE ON PRESIDENT
TRUMP IN A NEW ESPN PODCAST.
>>THE NUMBER ONE JOB IN
AMERICA, THE POINT OF PERSON, IS
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
THE PEOPLE AND REALLY DON'T GIVE
A  ABOUT THE PEOPLE.
>>THERE IS MORE GRIPPING
INSIGHT, ESPN ASKED JAMES AND
KEVIN DURANT ABOUT TRUMP'S
RACIST COMMENTS.
WEISS OUR
COUNTRY IS NOT RAN BY A GREAT
COACH.
>>
IT'S NOT EVEN A SURPRISE WHEN HE
SAYS SOMETHING, IT'S LAUGHABLE.
>>IT'S LAUGHABLE BUT ALSO SCARY,
I SHOULDN'T BE NUMB TO YOUR
RACIST COMMENTS AND BEHAVIOR.
>>THEY ADDRESS TRUMP'S RHETORIC
AND HOW IT HAS LED TO SOME
RACISTS BASICALLY FEELING
COMFORTABLE AND EMBOLDENED
ENOUGH TO COME OUT AND SHARE
THEIR PERSPECTIVES IN CERTAIN
COMMUNITIES, AND I THOUGHT IT
WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR THAT
PERSPECTIVE, ESPECIALLY AS
SOMEONE, LEBRON JAMES, SOMEONE
WHO EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT OF RACISM HIMSELF
PERSONALLY VERY RECENTLY.
SOMEONE SPRAY-PAINTED THAT "N"
WORD ON HIS HOME IN LOS ANGELES,
WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE A
LIBERAL PART OF THE COUNTRY.
HE
MADE AN INTERESTING STATEMENT AT
THE TIME ABOUT HOW EVEN AS A
SUCCESSFUL BLACK MAN WHO IS
WEALTHY AND LIVING IN AN
AFFLUENT PART OF THE COUNTRY,
YOU STILL GET CONFRONTED BY THAT
TYPE OF RACIAL TENSION, BY THAT
TYPE OF RACISM.
THAT IS A
PERSPECTIVE THAT SHOULD BE
HEARD.
AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A
PLATFORM LIKE LEBRON JAMES DOES,
I FEEL LIKE HE HAS ALMOST SOME
SORT OF A RESPONSIBILITY TO
PROVIDE A VOICE FOR THE
VOICELESS, AND I APPLAUD
HIM FOR DOING WHAT HE DID.
>>THIS IS A TYPICAL CONSERVATIVE
THING OF, DUMB JOCK,
ENTERTAINER, JUST DO YOUR JOB.
SHUT UP, ALREADY.
TO BE FAIR TO
THE REPUBLICANS, IF YOU ARE AN
ENTERTAINER DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR
FROM YOU.
LIKE IF YOU ARE AN
ACTOR LIKE RONALD REAGAN THEY
HAVE NO INTEREST.
OR TED NUGENT,
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT DUMB
ENTERTAINERS, THE GUY WHO
CRAPPED HIS PANTS TO GET OUT OF
VIETNAM.
OR FOR EXAMPLE A
REALITY SHOW HOST.
AND IF YOU
ARE A VERY STABLE GENIUS/ONE OF
THE DUMBEST GUYS ALIVE WHO SAYS
THINGS LIKE I HAVE THE BEST
WORDS, ONE OF THE TWO GREAT
ATTRIBUTES I'VE HAD THROUGHOUT
MY LIFE IS THAT I'M MENTALLY
STABLE -- WHO SAYS THAT?
BUT I
DON'T MEMBER LAURA INGRAHAM
TELLING THAT DUMB ENTERTAINER TO
SHUT UP.
SHE SUPPORTED HIM
NONSTOP.
ALL OF A SUDDEN THOUGH
WHEN YOU DON'T AGREE, DUMB JOCK.
WHATEVER.
AND GET A LOAD OF THE
HYPOCRISY.
YOU SAW THE CHYRON
THEY HAD, THE GRAPHIC, R-RATED
COMMENTS BY LEBRON, HE'S GETTING
PROFANE -- DO YOU KNOW THAT
BOBBY KNIGHT, ALSO IN
BASKETBALL, BUT A WHITE COACH,
WHEN HE SUPPORTED TRUMP AND USED
CURSE WORDS AND WAS PROFANE IN
SUPPORTING TRUMP, THE SAME LAURA
INGRAHAM SAID THAT WAS GREAT, HE
REJECTED POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.
>>THAT'S RIGHT.
AND SHE IS VERY
SUPPORTIVE OF A PRESIDENT WHO
HAD SAID THAT HE GRABS WOMEN BY
THE PUSSY.
I WOULD ARGUE THAT'S
A LITTLE R-RATED FOR MY TASTE.
>>THAT WAS JUST LOCKER ROOM
TALK.
BUT LEBRON JAMES AND KEVIN
DURANT CAN'T DO LOCKER ROOM TALK
EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE IN AN
ACTUAL LOCKER ROOM.
IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE SHE HAS TWO
DIFFERENT STANDARDS.
>>LET'S HEAR MORE ABOUT HER
PERSPECTIVE ON THE COMMENTS
COMING FROM THE PLAYERS.
>>MUST THEY RUN THEIR MOUTHS
LIKE THAT?
UNFORTUNATELY A LOT
OF KIDS AND SOME ADULTS TAKE
THESE IGNORANT COMMENTS
SERIOUSLY.
LOOK, THERE MIGHT BE
A CAUTIONARY LESSON IN LEBRON
FOR KIDS.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU ATTEMPT TO LEAVE HIGH
SCHOOL A YEAR EARLY TO JOIN THE
NBA. AND IT'S ALWAYS UNWISE TO
SEEK POLITICAL ADVICE FROM
SOMEONE WHO GETS PAID $100
MILLION A YEAR TO BOUNCE A BALL.
OH, AND LEBRON AND KEVIN, YOU'RE
GREAT PLAYERS BUT NO ONE VOTED
FOR YOU.
MILLIONS ELECTED TRUMP
TO BE THE COACH.
SO KEEP THE
POLITICAL COMMENTARY TO
YOURSELF.
OR AS SOMEONE ONCE
SAID, SHUT UP AND DRIBBLE.
>>YOU KNOW, 3 MILLION MORE
ACTUALLY VOTED FOR TRUMP'S
OPPONENT, BUT THAT'S NOT
CONVENIENT INFORMATION FOR YOUR
COMMENTARY SEGMENT.
BY THE WAY,
DWYANE WADE, WHO IS GOOD FRIENDS
WITH HER LEBRON JAMES, WANTED TO
SHARE HIS THOUGHTS ON THIS, AND
HE SAID THEY USED TO TRY TO HIDE
IT, MEANING RACISM, NOW THE
PRESIDENT HAS GIVEN EVERYONE THE
COURAGE TO LIVE THEIR TRUTHS.
>>MY TAKE ON THIS -- I KNOW
LAURA INGRAHAM, AND HERE'S THE
THING, ONE THING I WILL GIVE THE
FOX NEWS CHANNEL, BECAUSE I WORK
THERE, NO ONE IS EDITORIALIZED,
WE CAN SAY WHAT WE WANT TO SAY,
WE ARE NEVER BROUGHT INTO THE
EXECUTIVE'S OFFICE BECAUSE WE
SAID WHAT WE DIDN'T LIKE.
THAT'S
THE BENEFIT OF WORKING THERE.
LAURA IS ENTITLED TO HER
OPINIONS, I DISAGREE WITH THEM
VEHEMENTLY, BUT ALSO LEBRON
JAMES AND KEVIN DURANT AND
DWYANE WADE ARE ALSO ENTITLED TO
THEIRS.
AND TO SAY THAT THEIR
LANGUAGES R-RATED, AND I SAID
THIS, OUR KIDS ARE WATCHING, AND
WHEN OUR PRESIDENT CAN GET UP IN
FRONT OF A RALLY AND CALL COLIN
KAEPERNICK AN S.O.B.
OR HE CAN
SAY GET OUT, YOU ARE FAKE NEWS,
ROUGH HIM UP, PUNCH HIM IN THE
FACE, THIS IS NOT OKAY.
KEVIN
DURANT AND LEBRON JAMES AREN'T
THE PRESIDENT, SHE'S RIGHT ON
THAT POINT, BUT TO SOME EXTENT
THE PRESIDENT HAS NO MORALS AT
ALL, HE'S NOT A ROLE MODEL.
I
DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS BUT IF I DID
I WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO MODEL
THEMSELVES AFTER THE PRESIDENT.
THERE ARE REPUBLICANS I LIKE, I
WOULDN'T MIND MY KIDS LOOKING UP
TO GEORGE W. BUSH OR RONALD
REAGAN, I DON'T LIKE THEIR
POLICIES BUT THEY CONDUCTED
THEMSELVES AS HONORABLE MEN.
THIS GUY BROUGHT THE WHITE HOUSE
DOWN TO THE MORAL STANDARDS OF A
GUTTER.
IT'S GUTTER, REALITY
SHOW, VH1-LEVEL REALITY SHOW AT
THE WHITE HOUSE.
>>EVERYTHING SHE IS ACCUSING
LEBRON JAMES OF BEING IS WHAT
SHE LOVES ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.
SHE CRITICIZES LEBRON JAMES FOR
HIS PROFANITY AND HIS GRAMMAR --
DO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP IS A
GREAT PUBLIC SPEAKER?
DO YOU
THINK HIS GRAMMAR IS TOP-NOTCH?
DOES HE SOUND LIKE AN EDUCATED
PERSON?
I KNOW HE WENT TO --
>>SOME OF THE BEST SCHOOLS.
>>NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN AS
EDUCATED AS TRUMP, THAT'S WHAT
HE WOULD SAY.
BUT HE WOULDN'T
SAY IT CORRECTLY.
HE DOESN'T
KNOW HOW TO SPEAK, HE CAN'T PUT
TWO WORDS TOGETHER, AND SHE HAS
THE AUDACITY TO GO AFTER OTHERS
ABOUT THEIR GRAMMAR?
>>I DON'T WANT MY KIDS MODELED
AFTER ANY OF THOSE GUYS TO BE
HONEST.
GEORGE W. BUSH STARTED A
WAR, MILLIONS DIED, HE'S A
TERRIBLE GUY.
YES HE DOESN'T
CURSE AND HE DOESN'T DO THE
VULGAR THINGS TRUMP DOES.
REAGAN
DID TERRIBLE THINGS, THEIR
ACTIONS ARE VULGAR, BUT I
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.
AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT CURSING,
LYNDON JOHNSON CURSED ALL THE
TIME, I DON'T CARE.
SO WHY ARE
ATHLETES THE ONLY PEOPLE NOT
ALLOWED TO GIVE THEIR OPINIONS?
WHEN JOE THE PLUMBER CAME OUT IN
2008 AND HATED OBAMA THEY WERE
LIKE YES, A PLUMBER!
SO WHY ARE
ATHLETES THE ONLY AMERICANS NOT
ALLOWED TO GIVE OPINIONS?
IF YOU
DON'T KNOW THE HISTORY OF IT,
AND IF YOU ARE BEING KIND TO
LAURA INGRAHAM SHE DOESN'T KNOW
THE HISTORY, BUT I THINK SHE
DOES -- WHEN YOU TELL
AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO STOP
RUNNING THEIR MOUTHS, SHUT UP
AND DO THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
THAT WE TOLD YOU TO DO, THAT HAS
A DEEP HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRY.
SO IF YOU DON'T KNOW
IT, LOOK INTO IT.
THERE ARE A LOT OF BOOKS ABOUT
IT.
>>IT'S BLACK HISTORY MONTH.
>>IT IS NOT THING THE
CONNOTATIONS ARE CLEAR
