so much to get to today the trouble with you Familia allottee catches up with them and then you get the Chico Marx line who you gonna believe me or your own eyes your own Lionel eyes Democrats have labeled a massive group of illegal aliens dreamers and they're only referring to illegal aliens brought to the United States when they were minors no fault of their own they say their parents fault these are the people unconstitutionally protected by Barack Obama's daca program the trouble with daca is that it only protects a certain group of illegal aliens brought to the US as minors it only protects those who were born after June 15 1981 have lived in the u.s. continuously since June 15 2007 and registered for the program between June 2012 and September 2017 trouble is that covers nowhere near all of the illegal aliens brought to the US as children Steny Hoyer Democrats House Minority Whip even admitted as much when he pointed out that the euphemism dreamer and the technical term daca recipient are not a distinction without a difference there's there is a difference between those two things Democrats want to pretend there aren't two weeks ago USA Today gave the fuller story the real number of illegal aliens brought over as children is around 3.6 million four and a half times as many as Democrats admit in all of their legislative maneuvering that is an estimated third of all illegal aliens in the US and that doesn't count the millions of immediate family members who are already citizens that's a convenient omission since amnesty for the dreamers would be a dream come true for Democrats according to Pew Research Hispanics are five times as likely to identify with the Democrat Party is with the GOP even among registered voters the trend holds there are well over four times as many Hispanic voters registered with the Democrats as with Republicans even for Hispanics who don't identify with either party they are two and a quarter times more likely to lean toward Democrats native-born Hispanics are four point four times as likely to identify with Democrats foreign-born Hispanics are five point six times as likely to identify with Democrats
