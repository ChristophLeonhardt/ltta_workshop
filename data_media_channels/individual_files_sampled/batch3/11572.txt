hi it's Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report I've got a warm fuzzy feeling all this talk about gun reform we're all gonna just join hands and sing up with people and I'm looking forward to that oh boy Stacy well I think you're talking about Trump Donald Trump taking on the NRA in a remarkable way that we haven't seen certainly in the modern era where he said that basically both the Republicans and the Democrats were afraid to do any legislation on gun control because they were owned by the NRA essentially which is remarkable that I think they gave him something like 30 million dollars in 2016 but yeah like this whole attitude toward Congress like you know your dude scared to death of the NRA you losers you Punk's not me I am the mafioso the Mafia the capitana and nobody scares me away not the man or eight thirty million dollars but nothing well we're gonna talk about some other sort of moments of foot spa that have since unraveled because a lot of Donald Trump's foot spa unravels quickly he says one thing and then he does another well Jamie Dimon also says one thing and does another of course you know he's no shima Giggy well here's a headline from the past week and that is JPMorgan chick queen a fraud the big Bank is now taking cryptocurrency very seriously acknowledging the blockchain based technology as a veritable threat to its future yeah he must really hate to have to say this there the way it works is that if a company like a JP Morgan or there's another bank that made a similar comment up their big bank when they find a material risk to their business to their balance sheet they must under law disclose this to shareholders and so Jamie Dimon no matter how much he tried to talk down Bitcoin no matter how much he tried to get his buddies in Washington to outlaw Bitcoin and it mean the fact is he's lost he has lost the battle of Bitcoin he's got it now come crawling back to the market and say you know what the whole banking industry has been fundamentally changed we need to adapt over here JPMorgan or be left as I said many years now if they didn't adapt they would be relegated to a third tier Bank Jamie Dimon doesn't want to give away that free spigot of money he gets every day from nickel-and-diming people to death so of course he's going to adapt you know speaking of adapting Jim Rickards who has been on the show many times and he's very anti Bitcoin and he has always said the queen is horrible as well but he has also tweeted I saw that when he was over in China that we chat and Ally pay sort of apps are the way to the future that these will be the future of FinTech not Bitcoin but I think the way the u.s. works is we have we controlled that our banks JP Morgan bank of america goldman sachs they control the global financial system because we are the empire so there were no real legacy systems in Asia or India or Latin America to stand in the way of innovation so was it was ever possible that a we chatter and Alipay could enter the likes of those the equivalent I either quit so the equivalent would be eBay or Facebook or Amazon coming up with their own app as a payment system as as advanced as what we chat and a leap a have in China well JP Morgan would never allow that Wells Fargo would never allow that these banks would never allow that to happen in the US which is why if you know most Americans don't realize it but their their their financial technology here is so antiquated whereas Bitcoin has clearly forced them to have to compete now the financial technology in Kenya is leaps and ahead of America but it's funny that Jamie Dimon has had to capitulate and someone like a Jim Rickards ooh it's a friend of ours you know he's very anti Bitcoin but he's kind of like trying to figure out how to not be anti bit going to be Pro Bitcoin at the same time so he's kind of talking about alternative currencies he's talking about oh and Asia they have different ways to do financial technology everything but the final capitulation which will come he will join the Bitcoin crowd I predict and the Sun will Peter Shiff obviously have to completely break down and capitulate and jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon or be relegated out of business so Bank of America also in their annual report to the SEC did say that as well cryptocurrency is a risk to their business model in JP Morgan's actual report it says that in JP Morgan Chase's and a report released last Tuesday afternoon the bank counted crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and etherium they also mentioned as risk factors to its business for the first time recognizing the digital currencies as new forms of competition that could quite literally give the bank a run for its money right so that cuts into their primary business which fees alluded earlier to Jamie Dimon nickel and diming people to death you know they just charge fees on everything overdraft fees and late fees and this fee and ATM fees and if they charge you to take money out of your own account with an ATM card you know charges three bucks to take out 50 bucks out of your own account that's obviously a predatory behavior so Bitcoin eliminates all that so all that free money they get every single day by being out of control pernicious ugly tapeworm like parasites is going to be disintermediated by Bitcoin and now they have to admit that to their shareholders herface shareholder lawsuits in other words Jamie Dimon doesn't want to have to go in front of an arbitration panel and explain why after talking about Bitcoin so much he wasn't aware of the fact that their business model is now big disrupted so he's being forced to come to the table as the entire industry will be forced as Warren Buffett will be forced to come to the table he's a big shareholder in Wells Fargo Bank he will also have to capitulate so will Charlie Munger by the way speaking of the SEC in crypto currencies they have of course issued subpoenas to about 80 ICO company's initial coin offerings these tokens will go into that in a coming episode but I want to get to these next stories because that ICO story is a pretty big story interesting I think it's part of the development of this space actually of the token and cryptocurrency ecosystem merging into you know basically it's capitulation from the SEC as well as capitulation from the regulator's just like Jamie Dimon and JP Morgan have admitted that bitcoin is a threat to their business model this is the SEC saying okay come to the table what how do we make this all work for all of us but another big liar and the vein of Jamie Dimon but from the opposite side it is 50 cent admits in bankruptcy document that he never actually owned any Bitcoin 50 cent admitted in the bankruptcy documents that recent media reports have falsely stated that he made eight million dollars in Bitcoin none of which he had disclosed to the bankruptcy court in reality he says he has never owned any Bitcoin from 2014 to the present the 700 bitcoins he reportedly earned from the album sale sales were converted to US dollars by a third party before 50 cent or his affiliated companies could receive it we knew that was bogus from the beginning because of course I believe it was bitpay that received the bitcoins for him and they convert immediately to dollars and this is one of the arguments that the likes of Jim records we're not picking on him he's a good friend and he can you know basically defend himself so 50 he would say that no merchants would ever accept Bitcoin because it's too volatile well bitpay takes that out of the equation they give them dollars and immediately they convert it the Bitcoin they received two dollars in this case 50 cent would have been eight million dollars richer or at least the bankruptcy courts would his creditors would have been eight million dollars richer that's not the story I heard would you hear I heard this is from my friends at bitpay actually because I we know that company very well that it was 50 cent and Snoop Dogg were presented with 30,000 Bitcoin as a paper wallet they rolled it up and smoked it in a spliff that's what I heard so that would be like 300 million dollars that they smoked up Snoop Dogg hasn't come down from that huh he still I use with Martha Stewart for a while that's how high Snoop Dogg guy he's in a cooking show with Martha Stewart how high do you have to be to do that 50 cent you know he even though his name is 50 cent he could have been owning Bitcoin at 50 cents it's now at you know what whatever it's at now it's at it's about a million dollars of coin yet it will isn't that a million yet that's what I'm waiting for it's about a million yet it is still in the ten thousands it'll be at a million dollars of coin and then the Snoop Dogg 50-cent debacle will have cost three times the actual net value of planet Earth okay well I know in the second half we're talking to Mitch Firestein and at least you are and I wanted to turn to this headline to kind of go with what you're talking about with him over the past two episodes the end of the low volatility regime why buybacks are a clear and present danger to the anomalous market they help fuel so according to the IMF estimates recently large US corporations have experienced a negative net equity issuance of three trillion dollars since 2009 due to share buybacks u.s. corporate debt piled on both strong and and weekends sits at an all-time high of thirteen point seven trillion dollars so our team is capital looks at this data and what they're saying is that share buybacks accounted to 40% of total earnings per share growth since 2009 and 72 percent of earnings growth since 2012 so when you look at these markets that have been showing signs of volatility recently this is the basically the buybacks have been causing the absence of volatility for the past nine years and if those ends then the volatility will return do you say our team is capital or Artemis cat well you say potato right yeah I do say potato no you do nobody says potato he also said it was was the word nebulous no you said it was an anomalous anomalous which sounds like a character from Star Trek like a Klingon it's like quick teaser of that anomalous but anyway getting to the point the share buyback programs are up until recently completely illegal they were made legal under Reagan I believe yes too give corporations a way to make lots of money at the expense of the public good at the expense of the economy at the expense of their incentives right like it it gives them abusive incentives right it misaligns the incentives within the corporation so that the executives are compensated not for building a company and for spending money on capital expense like building the economy it says the billions and billions of dollars going into building out capacity by building a factory by hiring people by by by developing they use it to buy back their own stock to give themselves all that money to themselves and so you have this plutocracy and wealth and income gap skyrocket clearly a root cause is by getting rid of the law that made it illegal to buy back your own stock but they'll never repeal that law of course because the plutocrats now own the government well but according to the article so of course there is no doubt there is a clear bull case for why buybacks could prove the savior rather than the Achilles heel of US equity markets this year with the new tax law reducing liabilities and incentivizing repatriation buybacks are already on record pace 171 billion dollars worth have been announced so far in 2018 more than double the amount disclosed by mid February 2017 and since this article there's now over 200 billion dollars even Snoop Dogg will tell you never get high on your own supply okay they should take that to Congress and smoke that well but the share buybacks have doubled since last year at this time which suggests that just as the critics of Trump's tax law did argue that it would just go to share buybacks which don't contribute to the economy which don't help the long term economy it won't just be a sugar high this could last until 2002 midterm elections in 2018 but then it could fizzle yeah I'm surprised that Snoop Dogg wasn't made Federal Reserve Chairman well we're gonna take a break and when we come back Snoop Dogg won't be here so don't go away welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm max geyser time that a return to a conversation with a Mitch Firestein author of Planet Ponzi Mitch welcome back thanks for having me again you know hey how many languages is your book translated into I don't know four or five I think that's amazing people around the world catching up on your view of things and thanks for coming on again I want to follow up you know we left off on Charlie Munger being you know no good Nick you can catch that if you watch the previous interview and then we rolled into JP Morgan a recurring theme on this show there long long silver what's going on there Mitch look I think 2018 is going to be the year of the commodities I mean I really I'm bullish on gold I'm bullish on silver right around these levels I mean if they go lower buy some more don't be sore buy some more if they go down you know I think it's I think that you know we're going to have a meltdown in the other markets because look you can manipulate markets but it's like winding a rubber band and eventually it's going to snap and if you look at what's going on I mean I call it the PDT syndrome it's called it Preto pumpy dumpee Trumpy so Toby Toby Toby yeah puppy Duffy Trumpy you you pump the markets then you dump them and then you blame it all on Trump so you know if you look at what's going on because he's taken ownership of all the equity prices roaring up to the top so when they dropped by 90% unfortunately you're gonna have ownership of the downside as well I think right so he's yeah he's taking ownership of this rally and of course that would be work against him if over do we see a massive sell-off and let's focus on gold and silver a little bit in commodities so JPMorgan you know they when they bought Bear Sterns ain't inherited an enormous short position and silver we ran that famous campaign a crash JP Morgan by silver they've since kind of flipped on their position apparently that their long silver and so you're suggesting that this is to be expected if you're looking ahead and seeing a massive rally and commodities and silver is a way to play it right well I think that there are a couple things going on with that would that play I mean I think the US dollar has seen better days I think US dollar hegemony has passed its sell-by date as well I think that that trade is over I think the euro has a lot of problems if you look at you know what currency what is a currency first of all a currency is a store of value right it's a promise of a government to repay people eventually are gonna realize with the United States issuing even more debt you know historic amounts of debt on debt on debt that the dollar has to go down because we can never repay the debt that we have which I explained and planet Ponzi we have 250 or 260 trillion dollars in debt when you include all the obligations that we have in terms of Social Welfare entitlement programs Medicare Medicaid and it just keeps going up and up and up and eventually you know the dollars gonna go down and down and down and so are the other currencies because people are gonna realize they're worthless and you know you get the people the talking heads that come on your your mainstream fake news media that'll tell you that gold is a worthless rock and so is silver but if you look and go back and do your own research gold has been a currency for five to six thousand years and they always go back to it so I don't know if it's going to be China or a combination of China Russia and other countries that are going to come up with a currency that's actually exchangeable for a basket of commodities but that will happen and it will happen fairly soon and it will replace the US dollar so that's a pretty big statement there so let's focus on this for a second say you're positing that we see a big country introduced like a gold or commodity back currency that would really put the kibosh on the US dollar right to figure out and calculate - things are impossible to pick the absolute peak bubble when the bubble is the biggest is an impossibility and and to figure out when this will happen is impossible but is it is it going to happen soon yes should it have happened already yes well this government tried to do anything it can or any government to prevent it absolutely all right so let me give a scenario here so you're a professional money manager you're at your desk you're looking a bunch of screens you've got a pile of cash and you're trying to make returns for folks and you've got some scenarios to work out one is interest rates look the view and go higher which would be theoretically a positive for the dollar you've got gold which has been in a kind of a bearish market for a few years although you know ticking up nicely on an annual basis versus let's say cash right and then you've got an overinflated stock market so now you're you're thinking okay so of those three variables the rising interest rates how do you see that playing into your role as a professional fiduciary money manager is that going to how do you play that what does it mean isn't that positive for the dollar and so how do you how do you work that here's what I think I think that there are you know there are a lot of opportunities and and you know I'll see opportunities you know the average age of a trader out there is 27 to 28 maybe 30 max so what you're seeing is none of these kids or you know Millennials have seen a bear market they don't know what a bear market is so they don't remember when you know 1981 when the ten-year bond was trading at 1583 right and it comes straight down from there so there's going to be opportunity and I'm saying you know bonds might be an opportunity if they because markets always overreach so if they sell off at a certain price you're gonna want to buy them because there will be a QE for whether that will work or not is another question so bonds eventually will be a buy right but the dollar unfortunately will collapse when that happens so you've got to be able to hedge that sort of position this idea that rates are gonna be ticking up in 2018 is is false in other words they could be ticking up slightly but if the markets react negatively there's gonna be QE 4 right they're gonna reverse themselves they're more they won't stick with that well I don't think I don't think if you if you think about this and you look at how much debt has been issued can rates really go up they can't because you reach a point so it's just they've been threatening rising rates now for years there never happens in any material should be closed they're a bunch of liars they could and so you know you can't believe anything they say zero credibility I mean go back and look at how many times they said they're gonna raise rates in the last 10 years and they haven't really so when you hear that they're gonna raise rates you simply say you're lying you could say yeah but you could say good luck good luck with that because if you reach a certain point if interest rates normalize which is over 6% max you can't afford to pay the coupon on the debt we have so you can't pay the interest off on the debt so we're insolvent so that won't it can't happen they won't let that happen so interest rates will not reach a reach a really high level and we'll never normalize in our lifetime right now so the scenario that I see developing and get your thoughts on it is that all of the big private equity funds who are fueled by this ultra cheap money close to zero percent money they're simply taking all the equity off the board so stocks would have to go down there have to be stocks available to go down but if you're just doing mergers and acquisitions and you're just built Berkshire Hathaway's exploding in value and all the private equity funds keep enormous lien growing in value and there's just there's less stocks out there in the market to go down if there is a bear market that's been cut in half the number of stocks out there that's asset inflation right so you know you can buy less than you used to be able to buy but as you know I mean you were in the stock market back in the day and you know that retail is always the last in so I mean I think we should take a little cautionary note out to the folks watching list that retail has been the massive amount of buying that we've seen at this point in time so a comment that was made by a millennial is that he likes if he's buying stocks because Trump's offers a insulation was the word that he that was used that there's an insulation to a price move down the Trump is what does that mean if anything or is that like to you a red flag like oh it's like the cab driver that's telling you to buy stocks and he's got a stock tip for you when you hear everybody talking about stocks - who know nothing you know that that's the time you want to be a seller not a buyer right so gold is looking cheap and the bond market could be a place to go and what about IC sovereigns like Russia to keep accumulating gold they just announced another big purchase of gold is that gonna continue is there gonna be a more sovereign purchase of gold well I think I think smart sovereigns will be purchasing gold I mean China has been purchasing gold you can't really tell China is one of the biggest producers of gold you can't tell how much gold they have now the price of gold seems to be you know it's gone down in the last couple days I mean any price below 1300 announces it is good value I mean you know that the cost all in cost is over $1,000 for people to produce it so whenever you can buy something near its production value it's always a good idea right and we haven't touched on cryptocurrencies at all should we talk about cryptocurrencies any thought about crypto currencies you know we've got Bitcoin of course as the number one the crypto currency out there it's had a tremendous run in 2017 obviously it's pulled back do you follow a crypto do you position yourself in crypto do you need - what's the chatter out there in the professional money management world okay so so crypto is is highly volatile so I do have a position in one of the bigger ones and it's you know I view it as a high volatility asset it's an asset and do I think the price can you know I don't know if it's a it's a binary type of item that can either go to zero go to a million but it can go it can go much higher I think that that people who invest in that though have to be able to weather the storm of it going up and going way down in the business that is a non correlated essence right so it doesn't really behave like other like everyone as stocks and bonds are kind of keen or the Fed etc is it a way to hedge against stocks and bonds that are keyed into the Fed is it a non correlated asset in that respect do you see in that I wouldn't see it as a hedge particularly but I would see it as something that you'd want to put speculative investment capital into and and look I'm not saying go out jump jump in full all boots but I think that you should diversify your assets and somebody's your professional money managers hang out in the back of your Rolls Royce is eating a great coupon mustard and having foie gras you is to talk about Bitcoin there's a lot of talk about Bitcoin but you know I think look bit Bitcoin a lot of people want to talk down Bitcoin because they want you at the US Charlie Munger also talked on Bitcoin even though he doesn't understand it obviously and he wants to forgive Wells Fargo for serial fraudster behavior right but look what I'm saying is is if you can afford to put a small amount of money in Bitcoin and you don't mind losing it if you should or you don't have a problem if it's going to go down I think that you should but I think you should buy silver I think you should buy gold you should buy a portion of Bitcoin and you should diversify into a wide basket now most of the funds and professional managers the big funds won't get involved because the volatility is too high if you look at the volatility I mean you see the volatility went to 20 1050 or something then you drop down to at 7,000 you can't put that on a P&L and go to your investors they're gonna go what is this I mean you know that's to two largest swing for most people to tolerate so if you can handle the volatility in the ride you know you buy it you try to buy something when it's low and just hang in there with it you know don't get nervous and sang like don't get nervous you know buy Bitcoin and it's impervious or something niche you always come up with a snappy things you come up with that for the sequel to Plateau ones a sequel coming for planet will close your eyes and buy the high Ponzi - coming in we're working on a bunch of other stuff right now that's that'll be a lot more fun all right nice nice to bring out the guys report thanks for having me all right well that's gonna do it for this edition of the cause of report what's being Max Keiser and Stacey I really think I guess Mitch Firestein author of Planet Ponzi do you want to catch us on Twitter it's kinds of report until next time y'all
