1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,760
“The big question
of this show is

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,180
how does a decent guy
become dead inside,

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,160
at least morally?”

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,385
[music]

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,490
“When I started ‘Breaking
Bad,’ I was always worried

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,120
about giving the characters
a problem that I didn’t see

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,170
a way out of.”

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,925
“So what now?”

9
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:23,350
“My philosophy has
changed over the years.

10
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,800
And in the writers' room,
if we can’t figure out

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,230
how this character is going
to deal with this problem,

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,030
maybe the audience
can’t either.

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,360
In episode seven, Jimmy’s
sidekick is arrested.”

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,415
“He’s a cop.”

15
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:43,040
“We’ve written
ourselves into a corner.

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,456
Then we’re like,
all right, great.

17
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:46,340
Now, we have to
get him out of it.

18
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,010
What do we do?

19
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,280
What comes next?

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,110
The cop was assaulted.

21
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,945
How do you get away with that
in any way, shape or form?”

22
00:00:52,945 --> 00:00:55,150
“You know, we came up with
so many different ideas,

23
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,330
but I think the thing
that got me excited

24
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,730
was just the idea of
an ocean of letters.”

25
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,114
“A ‘Miracle on 34th
Street’ kind of scene.”

26
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:07,444
“Are you prosecuting
Santa Claus?”

27
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:07,985
“Your honor?”

28
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,021
“Because it looks like
‘Miracle on 34th Street’

29
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:10,520
in here.”

30
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,230
“We came up with the idea of
this letter writing campaign

31
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,160
and the idea of Jimmy
having to travel all the way

32
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,115
to Louisiana to get the right
postmark on these letters.”

33
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:22,970
“How does he write
these letters?

34
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,760
He’s switching hands,
and switching pencils,

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,920
and using different
grips, and so forth.

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,690
Those handwritings are still
going to start to converge.

37
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,878
So he needs to get some
people to help him with this.”

38
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:36,260
“Ah, Jeanetta.

39
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:36,930
Very nice.

40
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,660
I like the hearts
over the I's.

41
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,626
It’s a real nice touch.

42
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:42,125
Would you like to
do some postcards?

43
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,731
It’s $0.50 per.”

44
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:45,220
“Yeah.”

45
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,300
“Different pens, please.”

46
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,960
“O.K.”

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,020
“He’s a kind man and a
good friend to everyone.

48
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,100
Jesus, they do make him
sound like Santa Claus.”

49
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,810
“This one has a phone number.”

50
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,560
“Let me see this.”

51
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,720
“In the best scam,
the mark feels smart.

52
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,640
And that was where the whole
idea of doing the telephone

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,600
gag came in.

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,710
We want the ADA to be able
to make a call to anybody

55
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,738
and find out that
this is true.”

[organ music]

57
00:02:08,614 --> 00:02:10,047
[ringing]

58
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:10,630
“Hello, there.

59
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,650
Free Will Baptist —

60
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,190
Pastor Hansford speaking.

61
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,110
Who this?”

62
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,420
“His lines of what he
would and wouldn’t do,

63
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,000
and who’s an appropriate
target and who is not —

64
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,435
they’re fading very quickly.”

65
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:23,410
“But here’s a moment
when Jimmy comes alive.

66
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,780
And it’s because
he’s risking a lot

67
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,510
and he’s getting
to play a role.

68
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,075
He’s using this
Louisiana accent.”

69
00:02:31,075 --> 00:02:32,985
“I’m going to step
into the vestibule.”

70
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:35,380
“Which, to be honest
with you, is something

71
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,525
that I saw him
do on 'Mr. Show.'”

72
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:40,800
“Now, this all reminds
me of a humorous story

73
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,860
of the traveling salesman.”

74
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,180
“Oh, there we go.

75
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,745
Have you set a date
yet for Huell’s trial?”

76
00:02:48,745 --> 00:02:49,757
“No, not yet.”

77
00:02:49,757 --> 00:02:52,150
“Well, would you
do me a kindness

78
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,390
and ring me up when
you do because we

79
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,070
got a couple of charter buses.

80
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,160
We’re going to bring the
whole congregation up

81
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,010
to y’all in Albuquerque.”

82
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,020
“As writers, you’re always
fascinated with someone who’s

83
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,970
creating their own reality.

84
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,790
We’re hoping to have
the audience suspend

85
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,350
their disbelief.

86
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,010
And the con artist is hoping
to suspend the disbelief

87
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,397
of his or her mark.”

88
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:17,230
“We are con artists.

89
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,640
We are trying to
con the audience

90
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,580
into believing that these
are plausible fictions.”

91
00:03:21,580 --> 00:00:00,000
“Bless you and I look
forward to meeting you.”
