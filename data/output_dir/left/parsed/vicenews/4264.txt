Zota is an online multiplayer game
that's so popular its championship
trophy comes with an eleven million
dollar prize it takes thousands of hours
to learn DotA's wolf and most people
give up long before they achieve basic
understanding
Dexter Thomas went to DotA's
championship tournament to see if anyone
could explain the world's most
annoyingly complex video game
bad
the photography
a ticket to the dota tournament cost
over $100 and nearly 17,000 people paid
that and five million more watch the
free broadcast online these teams of
commentators at the arena the broadcast
live analysis of the games in English
Chinese and Russian but if you aren't
already a dota fan it doesn't really
matter what language it say it's all
gonna sound pretty full but now he does
lots of comments up as well
he's got the BKB this is a nice cotton
but his fans know him by his gamertag
Suns fan he has a huge following on his
gaming broadcast and he even co founded
his own professional dota team he's also
passionate about getting new comers in
the dota so if you need something to
explain the game view change you guy
this is basically my first experience
with dota a period right
I'm a little bit overwhelmed to be
expected and it's not like I don't play
games because I do a great learning game
from this is life and so start me on the
basics how do you explain dota to
somebody who has no idea what's going on
the way I would try to describe it is
it's 5 vs. 5 online play players will
choose a hero which there are 100 plus
so there are a ton of heroes to choose
from and each of them have their own
skill set so the objective there's three
lanes it's already getting complicated
yeah there are three lanes to a level
let's say you start on one side the
other team starts on the other and the
idea is to push the other team to the
other side and kill their base it's
obviously easier if you play a bit but
dota is just one of those games but the
base level is very high which is why the
barrier to entry is one of the worst in
all of you scores for sure
how many hours would you say you put in
I think you logged out right now I'm at
like 2
than 100 I'm approximately 1070 right
now we all are experts no no the baby
hours have a big kind of movie even the
pros
that's definitely one of the you know
lately quality cooking
get better everyone warns me how like oh
this which is deep learning curve and
I'm like perfect that's right Lu me a
clash of titans here going the distance
to start off day one winner of this
match already guaranteed of 1 million
dollars this could be the real first
blood to start follow from Kuro crush
come through and for that that was first
letter that was the first year all dying
in England good will be here and here
they're going to second I can kill the
try to kill this guy
for dead
five-0 debt-related when I use like
they've got the control the position is
there's the game is theirs
the series is theirs at
once you gota as a beginner it's kind of
like watching a really intricate game of
tug-of-war except of sobbing - magic you
understand 5% kind of I mean because I
understand now why people are hitting
each other which is good
it was definitely it's very difficult to
die gentle and a little fizzy soda
freaks without empathy it's time for a
lot of people like I said once you hit a
certain point it's very rewarding are
you just really into getting other
people into the culture I think that's
just that just comes with any passion
that you're passionate about something
doesn't matter how nerdy it is you want
people to feel the same way huge for me
it's just literally my life with this uh
if I'm not passionate about what the
 is the point in all this
you
