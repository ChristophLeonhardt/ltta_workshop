1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,999
You're standing inside a
simulation of the interior of a

2
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:08,529
star, similar to our sun.

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,709
The blue strands you see
represent the sun's magnetic field.

4
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,799
A second set can be seen above in
the opposite hemisphere of the sun.

5
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,090
The convection of plasma flows
inside the sun generates its

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,210
magnetic field. These flows
are shown as blue and red

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,360
shapes, with blue representing
flows moving towards the center

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,970
of the sun, and red flows moving
outward toward the surface.

9
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,680
Here you can see the polarity of the
magnetic field beginning to shift,

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,259
shown by the change in color of
the strands as they change from

11
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:47,900
blue to white and then finally red.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,350
Now the polarity of the field
has fully reversed as shown by

13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,180
the red color of the magnetic
fields in both hemispheres.

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,080
The sun's magnetic field
reverses every 11 years,

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,440
a process which is accompanied
by solar storms that can

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,009
interrupt power grids and
satellite communications.

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,660
Researchers said their model
could provide insight that will

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,039
help better forecast the strength
of future solar activity cycles.

19
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,969
By understanding future activity
cycles, scientists could better

20
00:01:15,969 --> 00:00:00,000
equip satellites to survive the
onslaught of solar storms.
