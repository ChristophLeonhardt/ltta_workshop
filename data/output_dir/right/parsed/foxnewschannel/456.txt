THEIR CARS AS YOU SEE RIGHT
THERE ECHO PARK.
>> BOJANGLES.
BRIAN: WENT ON "SATURDAY
NIGHT LIVE" AND WORE A MAKE
>> QUIT
>> TUIT
>> THET
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN HAT.
>> THEY BULLIED ME.
THEY SAID DON'T GO
THROUGHOUT WITH THAT HAT ON.
90% OF NEWS ARE LIBERAL.
NEXT GUEST IS SOMEONE KANYE
WEST IS PROUD OF.
THEY ARE FRIENDS.
CANDACE OWENS.
YOU SPOKE OUT FOR THE
PRESIDENT AND KANYE LIKE
WHAT YOU HAD SAID AND YOU
BECAME FRIENDS AND MET.
WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO
WHAT HE DID IN THE AFTER
SHOW ON "SATURDAY NIGHT
LIVE."
CAN
IAN
>> I HAD TEARS IN MY EYES.
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW HAPPY
I HAVE BEEN IN THE LAST 24
HOURS.
MUCH NEEDED DEBELIEVE FROM
THE KAVANAUGH I DO BACK KEL
IS KANYE WEST STEPPING ON
STAGE AND SAYING WHAT NEED
TO BE SAID FOR A VERY LONG
TIME.
THERE IS NO DOUBT IS HE ONE
OF THE BRAVEST MEN IN
AMERICA RIGHT NOW.
THE LEFT HAS DECLARED WAR ON
OUR AMERICAN VALUES.
AND KANYE IS FIGHTING THE
CULTURAL FRONT.
BRIAN: YEAH.
HERE IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT
TWEETED OUT AFTERWARDS LIKE
MANY I DON'T WATCH SNL EVEN
THOUGH I PAST HOSTED IT.
NO LONGER FUNNY.
NO TALENT OR CHARM.
IT IS JUST A POLITICAL AD
FOR DEMS.
WORD IS KANYE WEST, WHO PUT
ON AUTO MAGNA HAT AFTER THE
SHOW, DESPITE BEING TOLD NO,
WAS GREAT.
HE'S LEADING THE CHARGE.
THE CROWD STARTED HISSING
AND THE CAST WAS ROLLING
WITH YOU
BUTH YOU
BUT HYOU
BUT HEOU
THEIR EYES.
BUT HE HAS NOT
PAID A PRICE AT THE I GUESS
WHAT I WOULD SAY THE RECORD
STORE.
BUT IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY
YET.
HE IS STILL SELLING WELL.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
LOOK, THE PRESIDENT IS SO
SPOT ON WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT
THIS SHOW BEING LEFTIST
PROPAGANDA.
I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES.
I ONLY WATCHED IT BECAUSE
KANYE WEST WAS PERFORMING
AND HE IS MY FRIEND AND I
WANTED TO SEE WHAT HE DID
WITH THE SHOW.
I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS GOING
TO PUT ON A MAGA HAT.
QUITE LITERALLY THERE WAS A
SEGMENT WHERE THEY WERE
SAYING OVER AND OVER AGAIN
BRETT KAVANAUGH CANNOT BE
CONFIRMED.
GIVING PERMISSION FOR THE
PEOPLE TO WATCH THAT SHOW TO
BE VIOLENT, TO PROTEST THESE
HEARINGS AND TO FEEL THAT
THEY WERE JUSTIFIED IN THEIR
ACTIONS.
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE, SO WHAT
KANYE IS DOING IS
UNBELIEVABLY BRAVE TO STAND
UP TO THE MOB.
TO PUT ON A MAGA HAT AND SAY
I SUPPORT THIS PRESIDENT.
AND BEYOND THAT I'M NOT SURE
IF YOU SAW HIS INSTAGRAM
POST YESTERDAY WHERE HE WORE
THE HATS BEGIN AND HE SAID
THIS HAT REPRESENTS BRINGING
JOBS BACK HOME TO AMERICA.
IT REPRESENTS MAKING SURE
THAT AMERICANS ARE TAKEN
CARE OF FIRST.
AINSLEY: HE WAS TWEETING OUT
ABOLISH THE 13TH AMENDMENT.
13TH AMENDMENT ABOLISH
SLAVERY AND INVOLUNTARY
SERVITUDE AND ALLOW
PRISONERS TO BE USED AS
SLAVE LABOR HE WALKED IT
BACK IN THE NEXT FEW TWEETS
AFTER THAT.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
HE WALKED IT BACK IT GOES
BACK TO WHAT KANYE SAID
ABOUT SLAVERY BEING A
CHOICE.
KANYE BELIEVES THAT THE
AMENDMENT DID NOT ABOLISH
SLAVERY WHATSOEVER AND WE
VERY MUCH ARE STILL SLAVES.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HE HAS
BEEN FIGHTING AND HAS BEEN
SAYING THAT I'M NOT SURE
EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID ABOLISH
THE 13TH AMENDMENT.
I DO KNOW HE BELIEVES AS I
DO BELIEVE THAT BLACK PEOPLE
TODAY ARE STILL ENSLAVED
TODAY MENTALLY AND IN THE
PAST IT WAS OUR BODIES THAT
WERE ENSLAVED.
BRIAN: RECONSTRUCTION WAS A
DISASTER.
IF WE DID IT RIGHT IN THE
1860S WE WOULDN'T HAVE A
1960S BUT WE DIDN'T.
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT.
AND HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT
A LOT OF REPUBLICANS FOR THE
LONGEST TIME WERE THE PLACE
TO GO FOR THE
AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE.
BUT SOMETHING SWITCHED IN
THE 1960'S.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
I HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS ALL
THE TIME WITH LINDEN BAINES
JOHNSON WHICH IN OUR SCHOOL
SYSTEMS IT IS TAUGHT TO US
THAT LINDEN BAINES JOHNSON
IS THE BEST PRESIDENT THAT
EVER HAPPENED TO THE BLACK
COMMUNITY WHICH COULD NOT BE
FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.
GREAT SOCIETY ACT
PROLIFERATED THE WELFARE
STATE.
THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT'S
BROUGHT AMERICANS TODAY
$22 TRILLION PAID INTO THE
WELFARE SYSTEM AND BLACK
