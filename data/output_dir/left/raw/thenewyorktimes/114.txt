1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,100
“When he comes up,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,030
keep your hands on the wheel.”

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,790
We’ve seen police violence
against black people depicted

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,130
in films and TV shows
for years now.

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,780
Everything from
“Sweet Sweetback's

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,530
Baadasssss Song,” a film
from the 1970s directed by

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,040
Melvin Van Peebles.

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,150
You have “Do the Right Thing,”
Spike Lee’s very important

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,420
film of the 1980s.

10
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,240
And even a sitcom
like “Family Matters”

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,310
dealt with the subject
of police harassment.

12
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,580
“Is that why you made
him get out of his car?

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,250
Is that why you
forced him to lie down?

14
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,940
Is that why you cuffed him?”

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,400
I think the difference
that we’re seeing now

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,240
is that because of the
media attention and the fact

17
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,350
that now we’re able to
actually oftentimes see

18
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,150
these shootings and
killings in our social media

19
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,970
feeds as they’re happening,

20
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,419
as a filmmaker, you
have to consider

21
00:00:49,419 --> 00:00:51,460
that the viewer might be
coming with that baggage

22
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,220
especially if your targeted
audience is people of color.

23
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,800
When a show or movie
does not take care

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,540
of its audience or
doesn’t consider

25
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,610
what the audience may feel
it becomes a huge problem.

26
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,510
And it could border on
exploitative or even sort of

27
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,320
wallowing in the suffering
that is happening on screen.

28
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,470
An example of a work
that does not carefully

29
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,510
consider the
audience’s reactions

30
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,200
to seeing these images
on screen is “Detroit.”

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,850
The focus on the suffering and
the way in which the camera

32
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,530
really zooms in on that,
even though it’s effective,

33
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,880
can also just feel very
uncomfortable and icky

34
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,239
to experience.

35
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:31,030
I think for those
artists who are wrestling

36
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,630
with the subject, especially
those who are black,

37
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,010
it’s important for
them not to dwell

38
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,850
on the suffering or
the horrific moments.

39
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,250
It’s also very
important to focus

40
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,040
on the recovery, the
aftermath, the emotional toll

41
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,720
that comes along after
the incident has happened.

42
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,000
And I think one of the
better examples of this

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,780
has been “Queen Sugar.” In
Season 2 of “Queen Sugar,”

44
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,450
one of the characters,
Micah, who’s in high school,

45
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,490
gets pulled over while
riding in a very

46
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,260
expensive new birthday
present from his parents.

47
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,520
“Let me see your registration —
now.”

48
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,639
It’s not until later in
the season when we learn

49
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,800
what happened to Micah.

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,520
And we don’t have
to see it to know

51
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,020
how harrowing it is for him,

52
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,250
and that’s what makes
it really powerful.

53
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,500
“He takes out his gun,

54
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,387
pushes me down

55
00:02:20,387 --> 00:02:21,940
and he puts the
gun in my mouth.

56
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,080
And he pulled the trigger, Dad.”

57
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,490
Another trend that’s been very
interesting to see among film

58
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,000
and TV shows has been
narratives that explore

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,630
the idea of police violence,

60
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,540
but not in a very
explicit way.

61
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,450
The interaction doesn’t
lead to any grand moment

62
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,920
or any shocking moment.

63
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,422
Instead, it’s just a very
awkward moment

64
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:44,860
and a couple of shows
that have done that well

65
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,340
have been “Insecure”
and “The Chi.”

66
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,660
With “Insecure” there’s
a scene in Season 2 —

67
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,050
“You in a rush?”

68
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,525
“Uh, no, sir.”

69
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:57,565
“You must be, making your illegal U-turn.”

70
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,700
Watching Lawrence's
body language

71
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,620
and the way in which
he uncomfortably

72
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,450
chats with a police officer
is part of what makes it

73
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,880
so visceral and feel so
grounded and real.

74
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,070
“Uh, here you go.”

75
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,350
And in “The Chi” there is a
similar instance where Brandon

76
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,070
is stopped by two police officers,
one black and one white.

77
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,740
“What are you stopping me for?”
“Get over the car.”

78
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,510
The threat of police
violence is something

79
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,880
that probably even more
people can relate to

80
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,752
than the actual
actions of them.

81
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:27,210
So when you think
of these projects

82
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,950
that are selective
with what they show,

83
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,840
I think we’re looking at works
that are really interrogating

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,220
and going deep into the way
in which these experiences

85
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,080
can affect us on both
an emotional level

86
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,480
and a psychological level.

87
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,790
“When an officer tells you
to stop, you stop.”

88
00:03:44,007 --> 00:00:00,000
“Yes, sir.”
