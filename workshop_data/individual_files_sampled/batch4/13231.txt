people these days are starving for identity and community people want to know who they are and and what they are and why they are and what's the point of everything so that's why it seems like every day a new community crops up a new community or a sub community or an offshoot of a sub community community of a community and people will find their identity and their community in anything at all it seems like everything these days is a community so it's a oh I I'm part of the Blink community and very often people will structure this around their sexual there's their sex lives their sexual proclivities so every sexual proclivity becomes a community every fetish every sexual interest is its own community and it's an identity it's a lifestyle this is my lifestyle this is this is the kind of sex I like to have so it's my life that's my identity it's Who I am as a person and sometimes this craving for identity you know it just kind of in our culture it's getting increasingly bizarre and just weird so there's so many examples of just the weirdest kind of identity people find for themselves so of course one example just a classic example now would be the bronies bronies are adult adult men who enjoy my little pony for some reason and they dress up in my little pony costumes and they go to my little pony conventions and they wear my little pony apparel and they creep me out generally and this is their identity is that they like this show for little girls and then there are people who they they call themselves super fans and their super fans of something their super fans of a movie like Star Wars or their super fans of a show or a band or some other pop culture thing and we call them super fans because they have found their identity in their fandom nothing wrong with being a fan of something but then we go for a lot what's happens very often is we go a step further and people are obsessed with this thing so you're like Star Wars great then there are people that are obsessed with Star Wars and this is their life is Star Wars that this is where they find their happiness and their fulfillment they find themselves in Star Wars so there's a new Star Wars movie and they're camping out for three days they forget about work free to our family this is all that matters as Star Wars and this again every you know it's like seems like every film franchise every kind of whatever it's whether it's Marvel superheroes or whatever there are these super fans these obsessed people in the past I have I have myself run afoul of the what is what is what the kids call the beyhive and the beyhive I never thought I would actually say the phrase beyhive but I just did the beyhive are their super fans of Beyonce and so that gets what they call themselves and they just love Beyonce they absolutely love and adore her and they find their identity in her you know pop singer the point is we have a crisis of identity in our cultural culture people don't know who they are what they are why they are literally they don't know what they are because another thing is I think they're I think it it's other kins is another thing and that's other kins are people who feel like they're really animals inside so maybe they're really maybe a person is an other kin because she's really a cat inside so I shall crawl around and shall wear cat little cat yours and I don't know she'll use a litter box I mean this is what I think what happens in this quest for identity people are are there rather than looking without looking up people are looking deeper and deeper and deeper within themselves within their own psyches within their own egos they're just kind of plunging into the depths of of their minds of their subconscious and they're just bringing to the surface whatever they can find and what they find deep down in there is really just confusion and it's confusion that takes increasingly dark and disturbing forms but identity is what they want it's what they need it's what everybody needs and that's where Christianity ought to come in problem is that the christianity professed from many pulpits is just hollow and worldly and it doesn't give people that meaning and that purpose and that community and that identity that they crave so let's just take for example the Episcopal Church the Episcopal Church this week announced that they're going to be removing the words man woman and procreation from their marriage liturgy in just the latest in their latest sort of bow to the LGBT Lobby this is what they're doing because it's offensive to the LGBT people and Episcopalian Pisgah pelean ISM has been kind of skidding into oblivion for decades now over the course of the 90s they lost over 30% of their members and then in this century they've been losing I think about 2% annually every year and now there are fewer Episcopalians in America now than there are Jews which is significant because the Jewish people have always been a small minority in America the Episcopalian Church on the other hand the Episcopal Church hat used to be the dominant church in America not anymore what happened well you can easily track urges decline over the past several decades and you could track it because it corresponds directly with the church shedding its Christian orthodoxy in favor of liberal secular worldly humanistic orthodoxy so as there you just it's just the two things are happening attendance is plummeting as the as the Episcopal Church are just getting rid of one Christian doctrine after another in the hopes each time of reversing this decline and convincing people to come by being less challenging and by being less Christian but instead people just keep leaving so it it began for the Episcopal Church as always as it always begins it began for them in the in the early to mid 20th century when they embraced birth control and divorce they got rid of their prohibition of prohibitions against birth control in the divorce this is where everything always starts okay and I know this is an uncomfortable conversation because it's it's not only Episcopal hsihu uh who embrace those two things in our culture but here's the thing our not just the Episcopal Church but our cultural plunge into the abyss began right there with the proliferation of divorce and birth control you want to find if you want to pinpoint an exact moment that's where it started that is where it has to start birth control and divorce because right there that is how you begin to undermine the family and to and to destroy the entire purpose of marriage and marriages the foundation of the family so with divorce you have forfeited the permanence of marriage which is one of its defining characteristics the other defining characteristic of marriage is its is it some procreative capacity so you thought you forfeited the procreative capacity of marriage you forfeited the permanence of marriage and now you've marriage is nothing now it serves no purpose it's absolutely you've turned it into just nothing and so we did that decades ago decades ago the Christian Church turned marriage into nothing and then we were shocked when eventually the gays came and won gay marriage well of course I could well be what we had no argument to make against them we've already said well yeah marriage nothing that's not a sale permanent yeah you can make a permanent vowel on the altar before God that doesn't mean you actually have to necessarily keep it and yeah you don't necessary first commandment of the of the Bible that he gives the man and woman is be fruitful and multiply it's a very first commandment that God gives human beings the very first thing he tells us to do is to be fruitful multiply you don't have to do that though you don't need to that's not really the point of marriage so the point of marriage isn't necessarily to have kids it's not necessarily a monogamous lifetime Union then what is the point and that's why we were so ineffective when the gays came and they wanted married and Christians were trying to explain no I don't know you can't you can't get married and the gays said well why not well we had no arguments to make coming from this perspective what we've already said marriage isn't necessarily permanent appropriate procreative well then what's our argument um not to mention that when it comes to divorce this is one of the things where Jesus I mean if you go and read the Gospels and you're reading them honestly it's almost no matter how many times you've read them it's almost surprising how often Jesus actually addresses this issue it's Alma I don't know it's almost like Jesus is God and he knew the situation we were gonna be in it where that where the world was gonna head I mean that's almost what it's like right no that is what Jesus is God and so he he's he's speaking of course he was speaking to the people around him he's also speaking to us and that's why this issue of divorce comes up so often in Scripture and he's so clear about Jesus is so clear saying you cannot get divorced getting remarried is a des adultery it's what he says marry a divorced woman it's adultery boom that's what he says it's clear as day so then they moved from there they moved to the ordination of women which again scripture so clear about this st. Paul and the epistles could not be more clear about who was supposed to be leading churches men Jesus couldn't have been more clear when he selects 12 apostles and their own men you could have selected women he had plenty of women around him in play who played very important roles as we know women we're at the foot of the cross women were the first to the tomb on Easter morning so they played a very important role they were not his apostles though you that means something could've chosen women he did he obviously wasn't beholding to the bigotries of his time as some people try to claim about Jesus he was not a man of his time he was a man he was a man transcending time and and so but he only chose men and then st. Paul comes in and confirms that no men are the leaders in the church but we said okay we're gonna ordain women and then it was a straight line to the ordination of openly gay clergy and then the approval of same-sex marriage and now there's nothing surprising really about seeing a feminist Episcopal preached blessing an abortion clinic or a transgender Episcopal priest performing a you know doing a service in a church adorned with rainbow flags nothing surprising about that and it's even less surprising to look around during that service and see that there's nobody sitting in the pews because why would they come and sit in the pews there's no point what would be the point right now what would be the point of going to an Episcopal Church what why why even go the message of liberal Christianity whether it's the Episcopal variety or any other variety the message of liberal Christianity is you're perfectly fine exactly as you as you are everything you're doing is fine make no changes keep up the great work that's the message hey it's all good exactly what you're doing right now just keep doing that okay just yep thumbs up that's the message now a very weak person may be happy to hear that message but they don't need to hear it twice they don't need to come keep coming back to hear it over and over again all you need to do is hear it once and then they'll just go off and and and live their life they only need to receive that affirmation one time and then they'll just continue living exactly as they were before just as lost just as confused just as hopeless the Episcopal Church like any worldly Church given everything it has to offer you go to an Episcopal service one time and sit down and listen to whatever nonsense they're spewing that's it that's all they got they got nothing else to offer you if a per person wants whirling worldliness okay if what a person deeply craves is worldliness they can go literally anywhere else to get it that's the problem and if they want lectures on diversity and inclusion they can go talk to their human resources director at work if they want encouragement to just continue along in their sin Satan is happy to provide it using a whole host of methods in our culture and most of those methods whether it's through pop music or TV or whatever will be far more entertaining and enjoyable than anything that the crusty old Episcopal Church can provide so there's no point if you want if somebody actually wants what the Episcopal Church or liberal Christianity will give them well they can get it anywhere they can get it get it anywhere in the world so going to an Episcopal Church for for the sort of Christianity that Episcopal churches preach it's like it would be like going to a fine dining restaurant and ordering a Twinkie it's just there's no reason if you want a Twinkie you just go to 7-eleven you can get it the Winkie anywhere no if somebody sets to themselves I want to go to a to a really good restaurant then most of the time they want to go because they're looking for something substantial they're hungry they want something real okay give me give me some real food and and in the same way if a person something higher okay if they want to be rescued from the dreariness of modern culture if they if if they if they want to find their real and transcendent identity if they want to be challenged if they want meaning if they want purpose if they want a mission in life well then they have even less reason to go to Episcopal Church or any other similar variety of Christianity because it's not substantial enough it's not different enough it's not saying enough it's not real enough it's not asking enough of them see this is the great secret of humanity that progressive inclusive Christian leaders don't understand the great secret is this religions grow they expect more of their adherence not less expect more be more orthodox have a message that's more at odds with the culture that's more demanding that's more challenging that's harder those are the religions that grow those are the churches that grow religions thrive when they provide a lifestyle that is radically different from the doll hollow pointless lifestyle that the world provides because people turn to religion for identity and if all they find is more the same more of what caused them to go looking in the first place then they're not going to be converted Church wants to grow and more importantly if it wants to save souls it has to have the boldness to completely entirely reject the teachings of the world so just act like they don't exist that's the way it should it should operate that's the way Christian shop should operate that's the way a pastor priest should operate that's the way churches should operate the teachings of the world the opinions of the world the orthodoxies of the world don't matter it it's wrong it doesn't matter it has no bearing whatsoever on anything we do and we do not care if how we live and what we believe is diametrically opposed to the world in fact if anything we we find some encouragement in that because we know how lost the world is and if we were to ever look and see that we're actually lining up with the world on something that would be a bad sign people are looking for a higher identity they're looking for an identity that transcends the world and you know this is it's it's a it's a natural human desire because everybody has this innate recognition everyone has this innate recognition that there's got to be more out there there's got to be more to the world there's got to be more to reality there's got to be more to themselves everyone everyone looks at themselves and they want to change everyone wants to change themselves that's the other part of this so you look around our culture and it's just people are it you know not only they're finding their identity in different places but they're radically changing and and and doing these makeovers to try to change themselves and sometimes in the most radical ways no I'm gonna take it well I'm gonna change my gender I'm gonna get surgery and change my gender but even if they're not going that radical it's still whether it's extreme diet plans or it's this or that or self-help books or motivational seminars or whatever it is we're joining a cult or something people are looking to change they're dissatisfied with who they are they look at themselves they don't like who they are they want to change they want to believe that it's possible to change they want to believe that it's possible to to emerge into some other kind of new identity that's that's that's different from what they have now because they're dissatisfied with it and that's where the church has to step in and says here's your new identity here it is you and the longer that a person languishes in the world the longer they languish in sin the more their identity kind of starts to fade and the lines start to blur and they become less that's what that's what sin does to you it lessens you it makes you less of yourself that's why um I think I made this point before but when you look at really evil people when you look at serial killers or school shooters or serial rapists or whoever you know when you look at the most deranged kind of people who are just wallowing in the darkest darkest sin when you look at that there and then they're all kind of the same aren't they it's like they're interchangeable one with the other you almost lose track of them school shooters so which which one did which one you know you can't even remember they're all you know they all seem to be identical in terms of just their motivations the kind of people they are just everything even their history their family situation to be kind of just the same they just blur together into one just mass of into one weird gross horrible fog of humanity that's what they become whereas when you look at the heroes when you look at had virtuous godly people well they're also distinct and different and beautiful and their stories are different and everything is just different they stand out there like these bright shining stars in the in the midst of the fuck they stand out they are so distinct because it's in that where we find our selves and ultimately when we stand before the throne of judgment we stand before God we're either gonna be welcomed home into communion with God where we will finally find our truest our perfected identity which is free from all of these sorts of patches of nothingness that are within us this kind of sin these holes you know sin sin are these these holes in our soul that are there and and so we all have these bits of emptiness in us some have more than others when we go to heaven well that's all filled in that's all gone right or if we're cast into damnation then there we will go and we will be just nothingness which isn't to say that hell is real or that we disappear and so we don't really go down not saying that hell is real souls go to hell Satan is real all that's real but the souls in hell have been stripped or rather they've forfeited all that's real about them all that's substantial because everything substantial everything beautiful everything distinct everything real comes from God not none of that goes into hell it can't and so the souls in hell are just this blur of ego still there in in in in some way you know now they're outside of time and space but so still existing but just nothing I'm reading a book called the Lord by or I just finished it actually it's called the the Lord by Romano goir Dini it's a beautiful book I highly recommend it about the life of Christ and he has a great line about judgment he says that as you stand there before God you'll find out how much of you is and that was a great way of putting it kind of a terrifying putting it how much of you still is because there's the you that God gave you and intended for you and then there's kind of the anti you but you claim for yourself through sin that which does not come from God Oh so Christianity should put us on the path towards finding our true selves in God but if it doesn't it the church doesn't step up to the plate then there are plenty of other places you know that then people will find that identity somewhere else why do you think Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world because it is why is that I think about it in our in progressive enlightened age Islam is the fastest growing religion why I mean this is a question the Christians should confront and confront it honestly I'll tell you why because it expects more of its adherents provides a way of life that is drastically different from the average it expects it demands total submission to its precepts if you're gonna become Muslim you can't partially find your identity in Islam it's no there's no partial commitment you're all in praying five times a day everything total reverence total submission Islam is not afraid to talk about obedience not afraid to talk about punishment concepts that have gone out of vogue in western Christianity Islam is an identity and so people come to it and they find this whole new identity and this challenge to live differently which is what they want say what you want about that identity but the fact is it is one which is more than I can say about Episcopalian ISM Islam is an identity being a biscuit ball at this point is just nothing it's just being nothing it means nothing you I don't have to go to his loan for examples there are some churches in America who have figured this out some during a minority I gave a talk at a church in Wisconsin just a few weeks ago and it was a very traditional church very Orthodox very conservative very it was beautiful I loved it and you know what else it was it was a young church it was growing I talked to the priest afterwards and he told me that when he first came to the parish age for parishioners was 70 and then he got in and he got you know he got rid of all the liberal reforms all that you know all the fluffy stuff you kind of started turning the clock back by about a thousand years in terms of how the the liturgies is is celebrated and now the average age of a parishioner is 35 why because it gives young people that totally submersed radical Orthodox experience that they crave it gives there's a point there's a reason to go to that church it had there's a point to it it stands apart from the world it's completely different from what the world is doing it does not echo or mirror the world at all that's why so there's a reason for it to exist there's something else people crave they crave virtue virtue we crave virtue so much but we find so few examples of it in the culture then now we turn to superheroes in fact I was talking to somebody recently and I you know and I've been in the past I've made it clear that I don't I I don't totally understand this superhero obsession especially among adults I get it it's fun but just you know adults going to see every new superhero movie and just so invested in superheroes I don't get it I really don't it's something about it seems well I just don't get it and I was talking to somebody about it and they told me that they said well you know it's it's an example of virtue it's an example of you know these are good guys and and so much of of Hollywood these days is is all about anti heroes and it's about these kind of tortured people that are just kind of morally ambiguous think of think of all the quitting tarantia every Quentin Tarantino movie ever made or just everybody is bad in the movie there's no virtue there's no goodness nothing and he made the point that Walt with a superhero movie say what else say whatever else you want about it but at least there are good guys and there are bad guys and there's a moral distinction between the two and they're fighting for good things so that's why people like it and and I think that's a good point but it's kind of sad isn't it that people are so starving for examples of virtue and stories of virtue and sort of a defense of virtue so starving for that they got to turn to Spider Man they got to turn to Batman for it when they should be able to turn to the church should represent that virtue should defend the virtue and challenge its adherence to live by virtue and defend it themselves challenged its adherents to be warriors it'll be real warriors to go out and fight and it shouldn't be be afraid to say that that we are in a we are in a holy war we are may not it may not be a physical war right now anyway but we're in a holy war we're in a word a war against the powers of evil and there are a lot of them and there's it's kind of overwhelming right now and so the church should be saying go out there and fight there should be some of that militant it should be kind of a militant flavor Christianity especially in our in our damaged that's how you build a church the Episcopal model is how you destroy it so I guess we just have to decide which to follow all right have a great weekend everybody Godspeed
