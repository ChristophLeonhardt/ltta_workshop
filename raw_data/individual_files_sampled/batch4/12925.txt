cNN has caught Donald Trump in another incredible gaffe the Republican candidate for belligerent president greeted reporters outside his hotel with a hearty good morning but CNN fact checkers soon discovered that it was not in fact a good morning somewhere and ran scrolling text beneath the screen for the next six hours naming those places where it was raining cloudy or otherwise just kind of blah and not good in the least experts contacted by CNN agreed the Trump had spoken too soon since the morning was only beginning and could not yet be said to be good with any certainty professional expert Reginald T sneering told CNN quote a president has to consider his words very carefully and Donald Trump's ill-timed remark is further proof that he doesn't have the temperament to be commander-in-chief he jumped the gun and gun should be made illegal before someone just hauls off and shoots me for being a differing put's unquote CNN's Christian I'm a poor journalist and other Clinton campaign officials agreed that Trump's now notorious good morning misspeak is among his worst gaffes ever up there with calling a bomb a bomb calling a terrorist a terrorist and calling CNN corrupt a CNN panel spent three hours discussing whether Trump's good morning would finally be the mistake that brought his campaign to an end then spent another half hour discussing white Trump's poll numbers had risen two points over the last three hours among viewers of CNN Hillary Clinton the Democratic candidate for taxidermic Lee preserved president discussed Trump's gaffe with reporters after fending off their shouted questions about what television shows she was watching and where she bought that alluring perfume the so-called gaggle with reporters a term meaning an informal gathering with slobbering toadies in which no difficult questions are asked was held at the back of the campaign plane that has been given numerous affectionate nicknames including broomstick one too hill in a handbasket and hill hath no fury like a woman who keeps being beaten out of the presidency by any damn fool who happens to feel like running addressing Donald Trump's good morning gaffe mrs. Clinton said quote good morning I think the fact that Donald Trump would wish people a good morning and times like these is just one more sign of whatever we told you people to say it was on CNN America is in terrible shape and we need a president exactly like the one we've had for the last eight years to make it different because it's already great I feel confident the barri toaster is floating above the garden hose wait what was I talking about where am I damn it the doctors told me these symptoms wouldn't appear until after the election there are no doctors I didn't send any emails where am I unquote host some reporters expressed concern that mrs. Clinton's remarks may have indicated she was suffering from a cold or a brain tumor or something the statement actually sounded much better when it was played later that day in an edited version on CNN with mrs. Clinton's mouth moving and Wolf Blitzer dubbing the words after that report Blitzer signed off saying good morning this is CNN unfortunately it was 7 p.m. trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show those were the daily wire singers with his that's the same team that does our Greek in Latin translations and we have to always give special thanks to a Cynthia Angulo we had to

traveling I was traveling to by the way I forgot it's mailbag day you know I'm so I'm so disorient I just stopped I stepped off the plane I mask got off the plane at like midnight last night so here I am back and I'm a little bit woozy my plane stopped in Charlotte Virginia so that gives you an indication of what the class this week where the Cleveland last weekend started I was traveling I went to the 700 club do we have the picture of me with Pat Robertson I met Pat Robertson this is under the 700 club Pat Robertson when you come into the 700 club which is this huge campus there was a picture of Pat Roberts Robertson shaking hands with every famous person from like Julius Caesar you know I mean the guy's old I mean the guys getting on there and he's like you know Caesar Napoleon there's actually in all honesty a picture of him as an adult man shaking hands with Harry Truman so I said to him when we took this picture I said well Pat I guess for a man who shook hands with a Harry Truman this isn't that big a thrill for you but anyway he was very gracious and the show did very well and hopefully will promote the book anyway it was a Clavin less weekend to be remembered I mean things with there is terrorism in New York and terrorism and Minnesota terror terrorism all over the place and then as I said my plane landed in Charlotte and there are riots suddenly in in Charlotte there's there were two police shootings one of them I have to say in Tulsa Oklahoma is still looking kind of questionable that was Terrence Crutcher who was shot by a female police officer leaving you know the New York Times to protest against having female officers because you know they're weaker so they're more likely to go to their guns that never happened I'm making that up she's a white officer as it says in the times and all everywhere she's a white officer not a white female officers do you have to choose what kind of bigot you're gonna be you have to choose how you're going to contain people to get the narrative right and so this is a big problem in Charlotte where a a black guy was shot by another black officer so it's really just indicative of the systemic racism of something-or-other I don't know what happened anyway the what happened was they were executing a warrant see a guy in a car guy gets out of the car not only the police but witnesses said he had a gun and one of the officers shot him here is the chief of police in Charlotte as they engage him he is armed with a handgun that we found on scene as well make some imminent threat to them and because of that at least one of our officers firemen and of course at the same time the guy the guys name is Keith Scott Keefe Lamont Scott and he's a woman who says she's his daughter put out this video which went viral and torched the whole thing off they jump off the car trying to break the window Jimmy got a gun he got it one lump got my daddy got a shot no today's the first then they shine your phone mother cock in the chest so so you choose which one of those guys you want to believe that police chief you know it is so it's so crazy now you know police police departments across the country have been in fact reorganized so that they represent you know the population that they're policing far more black officers far more of black police chiefs as we keep seeing we keep seeing these guys come on who are like all-american heroes whose skin just happens to be brown you know and then we see you can see look in front of you you can see these guys are noble upstanding people who are helping other human beings and yet the New York Times and the ABC and NBC and CNN they're all promoting people you know who you know God loved them I know they're ignorant and they're poor and all this stuff but they're full of rage and they're saying this stuff who knows whether it's true or not at least these police officers have some kind of responsibility to the public at least we can hold them responsible my favorite comment about this and I mean you hate to be comical but it's not my fault pull up politicians or ridiculous Hillary Clinton goes on the Steve Hart on Steve Harvey Show Steve Harvey is doing this worshipful interview with you you know how what's it like being a grandmother you know what's it like you know you can call me you know if nobody asked me that question whether they ask Hillary Clinton sit and this is talking about the Tulsa shooting by the female but white officer so this is the thing the important thing is white forget they just put on your mind that she's female she's white and she shot this guy and it's a questionable killing we're not sure what happened yet but it did look a little questionable here's what Hillary's gonna do for us we've got a tackle systemic racism this horrible shooting again how many times do we have to see this in our country in Tulsa an unarmed man with his hands in the air I mean this is just unbearable and it needs to be intolerable and so you know maybe I can by speaking directly to white people say look this is not who we are we've got to do everything possible to improve policing go right at implicit bias there are good honorable cool-headed police officers we've seen them in actions in New York over the last you know 48 hours because of the terrorist attacks we can do better we have got to rein in what is absolutely inexplicable and we've got to have law enforcement respect communities and communities respect law enforcement because they have to work together so she's gonna reach out to white people because she's got that special thing about being white you know we don't we don't have a lot of white people in this country so we have to reach out to those gonna reach out to white people and explain to us that this is not who we are well that was a wake-up call for me because I just wake up every morning thinking you know can I shoot an innocent black guy today you know that's I think most white people even talking about and then I like the way she says there are there are good police officers in this country you know thanks Hillary yeah I just want to remind you I just have to remind you right that Barack Obama has been president for eight years and that means that Hillary Clinton's policies because she's not recommending anything that's any different than what he's been saying have been in place for eight years here's Jason Riley writing from the Manhattan Institute my colleague at the Manhattan Institute great writer really excellent observer writing The Wall Street Journal this morning by almost any traditional metric homeownership median incomes labor participation poverty blacks are worse off today than they were at the start of mr. Obama's first term the jobless rate for blacks has improved since 2009 but it's improved even more for whites which means the racial gap and unemployment has gotten wider and that's not that and this is not Riley anymore but last year the hourly pay gap between blacks and whites widened to twenty six point seven percent which is the worst it's been in 40 years this is under Obama right and Obama then has the gall to go before the black caucus this is on Saturday this is his last speech before the black caucus first play that the short clip the first one you may have heard Hillary's opponent in this election say that there's never been a worse time to be a black person I'm a he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery and Jim Crow so his argument is that he's made things better since slavery that's like that's where that's enough thanks thanks Barack whereas Obama himself would say thanks Obama okay and now he he just this this is I mean to me complete emotional what's the word I'm looking for manipulation he's manipulating people emotionally this is what he goes on to say unbelievable in fact if you want to give Michelle and me a good send-off and that was a beautiful video but don't just watch us walk off into the sunset now get people registered to vote if you care about our legacy realize everything we stand for is at stake all the progress we've made is at stake in this election my name may not be on the ballot but our progress is on the ballot tolerance is on the ballot democracy is on the ballot justice is on the ballot good schools are on the ballot ending mass incarceration that's on the ballot right now and there is one candidate who will advance those those things and there is another candidate who's defining principle the central theme of his candidacy is opposition to all that we've done there's no such thing as a vote that doesn't matter it all meant and after we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012 especially in the african-american community I will consider it a personal insult an insult to my legacy if this community lets down its guard you know that is an incredible incredibly dishonest speech you should really look at it on the page first of all 1960 HS called may want their politics back you know I mean it's he starts out talking about slavery he talks about Jim Crow as if that's where we're coming from wasn't in place when he came into office things were things were better when he came in to office things were better for black people when he came in for office I'm gonna have to stop here just to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but come on over to the Daily wire here the rest and then subscribe
