1
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:11,296
>> THE INVESTIGATION WAS NOT

2
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:12,197
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, JIM COMEY

3
00:00:12,197 --> 00:00:13,332
TOLD THE PRESIDENT THAT THREE

4
00:00:13,332 --> 00:00:14,599
TIMES IN THE MEETINGS THAT IT

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,735
NEVER HAS BEEN THE CENTER OF THE

6
00:00:16,735 --> 00:00:18,003
INVESTIGATION, NOR IS IT THE

7
00:00:18,003 --> 00:00:18,937
ROLE OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL TO

8
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:21,573
TRY TO GET AN INDICTMENT OF THE

9
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:21,940
PRESIDENT.

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,141
HIS ROLE WAS VERY CLEAR TO SEE

11
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:25,277
IF THERE WAS ANY CRIMINAL

12
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:26,345
ACTIVITY AMONG THE CAMPAIGN.

13
00:00:26,345 --> 00:00:28,046
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE BASIS

14
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:30,182
WAS FOR THAT STATEMENT BY RUDY

15
00:00:30,182 --> 00:00:31,550
GIULIANI, AND WHETHER IT WAS

16
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,552
JUST AN OFFHAND VIEW BY ONE OF

17
00:00:33,552 --> 00:00:35,153
THE ATTORNEYS WITH THE FEDERAL

18
00:00:35,153 --> 00:00:37,756
COUNCIL, OR WHETHER IT WAS A

19
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:38,457
PRONOUNCEMENT BY THE SPECIAL

20
00:00:38,457 --> 00:00:39,157
COUNSEL HIMSELF.

21
00:00:39,157 --> 00:00:39,891
>> Bret: IT WELL, THE BREAKING

22
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:42,995
NEWS TODAY, RUDY GIULIANI

23
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:45,530
TELLING OUR OWN FOX NEWS'

24
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,834
JOHN ROBERTS THAT THE SPECIAL

25
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:53,005
COUNSEL FOLLOW DOJ GUIDANCE THAT

26
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:54,339
THE PRESIDENT WILL NOT BE

27
00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:54,706
INDICTED.

28
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:57,843
ACCORDING TO GIULIANI, MUELLER

29
00:00:57,843 --> 00:00:59,144
HAS NO CHOICE.

30
00:00:59,144 --> 00:00:59,845
AND THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY PUSHING

31
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:01,580
FOR THIS TO COME TO A

32
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:01,980
CONCLUSION.

33
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,749
WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN, AND

34
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:04,783
LET'S PUT OUT WITH THE SENATE

35
00:01:04,783 --> 00:01:05,550
PUT OUT.

36
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,154
LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL HERE IN

37
00:01:09,154 --> 00:01:09,654
NEW YORK.

38
00:01:09,654 --> 00:01:10,155
FORMER WHITE HOUSE

39
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:13,325
PRESS SECRETARY ARI FLEISCHER.

40
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:16,161
KAREN HEALEY BURNS, AND BILL

41
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:17,729
McGURN, MAINSTREAM COLUMNIST

42
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:18,730
FOR "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL."

43
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,097
OKAY, ARI.

44
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:23,602
YOUR TAKE ON GIULIANI AND WHAT

45
00:01:23,602 --> 00:01:24,770
HE SAID TODAY.

46
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,372
>> WELL IT SIGNIFICANT BUT, NO

47
00:01:27,372 --> 00:01:28,173
PRESIDENT'S HOME FREE AND

48
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:28,874
NEITHER ARE THE STAFF ARE THE

49
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:31,443
PEOPLE WHO WORKED WITH ON THE

50
00:01:31,443 --> 00:01:31,810
CAMPAIGN.

51
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,979
WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR BOB MUELLER

52
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:36,581
AND ONLY THEN ARE PEOPLE HOME

53
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:37,382
FREE.

54
00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:39,184
IT IS SIGNIFICANT, BECAUSE OF

55
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:40,552
RUDY GIULIANI IS RIGHT, AND I'D

56
00:01:40,552 --> 00:01:41,887
LIKE TO HEAR THIS FROM THE

57
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:43,422
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THEN IT'S

58
00:01:43,422 --> 00:01:45,557
A SIGNIFICANT SIGH OF RELIEF IN

59
00:01:45,557 --> 00:01:46,558
THE LEGAL SENSE.

60
00:01:46,558 --> 00:01:47,726
AS WE ALL KNOW FROM WHAT

61
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:48,660
BILL CLINTON WENT THROUGH IF

62
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,963
THIS IS A POLITICAL EXERCISE IN

63
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:53,165
ADDITION TO A LEGAL EXERCISE.

64
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:55,167
THE REAL JEOPARDY COMES FROM

65
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:55,834
CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN

66
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:56,768
PEOPLE.

67
00:01:56,768 --> 00:01:59,671
IF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THINK'S

68
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:00,939
THINK CRIMES ARE COMMITTED IT

69
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:02,941
WILL HURT THE PRESIDENT.

70
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:04,342
HAVING SAID ALL THAT, I STILL

71
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:05,310
SEE NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION.

72
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,945
I DON'T THINK THERE HAS BEEN

73
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:09,146
COLLUSION FROM THE START AND

74
00:02:09,146 --> 00:02:09,747
PARTICULAR THE THE MOST

75
00:02:09,747 --> 00:02:11,183
PERNICIOUS WOULD HAVE BEEN

76
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:13,852
INVOLVEMENT IN THE TRUMP PEOPLE

77
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:15,921
OF HACKING HILLARY AND PODESTA'S

78
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:18,423
EMAILS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS WAS

79
00:02:18,423 --> 00:02:18,857
ALL ABOUT.

80
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:20,559
>> Bret: A TEAM SUBPOENAED THE

81
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:22,427
SOCIAL MEDIA DIRECTOR FOR ROGER

82
00:02:22,427 --> 00:02:24,262
STONE TODAY, AND WE ALSO HAVE

83
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:26,531
THE RELEASE OF SOME SENATE

84
00:02:26,531 --> 00:02:27,599
DOCUMENTS.

85
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,201
IT PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR US.

86
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:31,536
>> THE SENATE DOCUMENTS REALLY

87
00:02:31,536 --> 00:02:32,270
CONFIRMED WHAT THE INTELLIGENCE

88
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,371
COMMUNITY SAID IT WHICH WAS THAT

89
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:35,440
RUSSIA MEDDLED IN THE ELECTION

90
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,142
TO HELP DONALD TRUMP.

91
00:02:37,142 --> 00:02:39,544
NOW THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE

92
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:41,346
HAAS, COW'S ASSESSMENT, THE

93
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:44,182
HOUSE ASSESSMENT OF COURSE THE

94
00:02:44,182 --> 00:02:47,719
PRESIDENT WAS CHEERING ON.

95
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,420
>> Bret: SENATOR LANKFORD TRY

96
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,123
TO STRENGTHEN STOMACH STRAIGHTEN

97
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:53,625
THAT OUT ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IN

98
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,159
THE COMMITTEES.

99
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:54,860
BUT GO AHEAD.

100
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,229
>> I THINK THE BIGGER POINT IS

101
00:02:57,229 --> 00:03:01,600
THAT THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION

102
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,801
CONTINUES, THE PRESIDENT IS

103
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:03,535
HANGING OVER HIS ADMINISTRATION

104
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:05,337
CERTAINLY AND HAS EXPRESSED

105
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:05,937
FRUSTRATIONS WITH THAT.

106
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:08,473
I'M INTERESTED TO SEE HOW THE

107
00:03:08,473 --> 00:03:10,408
PUBLIC REACTS THE LONGER THIS

108
00:03:10,408 --> 00:03:11,343
GOES ON.

109
00:03:11,343 --> 00:03:13,245
YOU HAVE SEEN IN POLLING, A

110
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:15,547
SLIGHT DIP IN PEOPLE'S

111
00:03:15,547 --> 00:03:16,348
PERCEPTIONS OF THE

112
00:03:16,348 --> 00:03:16,781
INVESTIGATION.

113
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,849
YOU'VE SEEN REPUBLICANS COME UP

114
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:20,252
BY A LARGE MARGIN, REALLY

115
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:21,386
OPPOSING THAT.

116
00:03:21,386 --> 00:03:22,320
AND YOU'VE SEEN CANDIDATES

117
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,523
RUNNING FOR OFFICE ON THE TICKET

118
00:03:24,523 --> 00:03:25,123
RUNNING FOR OFFICE ON THE TICKE

119
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:26,091
TICKET, INVOKING THE PRESIDENT'S

120
00:03:26,091 --> 00:03:27,926
LANGUAGE THAT THIS IS A WITCH

121
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:28,326
HUNT.

122
00:03:28,326 --> 00:03:29,361
THE PRESIDENT RESHUFFLED HIS

123
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:30,729
LEGAL TEAM BECAUSE HE DIDN'T

124
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:32,130
THINK THAT HE WAS GETTING THE

125
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,765
BEST ADVICE, AND HE WANTED TO

126
00:03:33,765 --> 00:03:35,133
HAVE A MORE COMBATIVE NATURE

127
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:39,738
WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL, SO WE

128
00:03:39,738 --> 00:03:40,672
WILL SEE HOW GIULIANI HANDLES

129
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,943
THIS IN THE NEW SPACE.

130
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:45,744
>> Bret: BILL?

131
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:47,913
>> I THINK IT WAS GOOD IN TWO

132
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:48,380
WAYS.

133
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,981
ONE, I THINK IS GOOD THE

134
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:50,582
COMMITTEES RELEASE THEIR

135
00:03:50,582 --> 00:03:53,351
FINDINGS BECAUSE OF THE ROOT OF

136
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:54,352
OUR SYSTEM IS POLITICAL

137
00:03:54,352 --> 00:03:55,353
ACCOUNTABILITY.

138
00:03:55,353 --> 00:03:56,621
AND AT WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

139
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:59,524
NEED IS TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

140
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:01,193
THE LONGER WE GO ON AND COME TO

141
00:04:01,193 --> 00:04:02,894
MORE QUESTIONS WE HAVE ABOUT OUR

142
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:05,263
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND SO

143
00:04:05,263 --> 00:04:07,666
FORTH, AND IT SEEMS LESS

144
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,134
EVIDENCE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, SO

145
00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:09,601
THAT'S ONE SIDE.

146
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:15,140
THE OTHER THING I THINK,

147
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,641
MR. GIULIANI'S COMMENTS WERE

148
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:17,341
GOOD.

149
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,678
THINK ABOUT THIS, THE PROSECUTOR

150
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:21,947
WHO ESSENTIALLY WORKS FOR THE

151
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,348
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT GUIDELINES,

152
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:25,850
AND THAT IS A NEWS STORY.

153
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,952
I FIND IT INCREDIBLE.

154
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:28,587
I THINK THE PROPER VENUE FOR

155
00:04:28,587 --> 00:04:29,287
MOST OF THIS IS CONGRESS AND

156
00:04:29,287 --> 00:04:33,058
IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT CONGRESS

157
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:37,028
HAS BEEN STONEWALLED IN ITS

158
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:38,430
PURSUIT OF MANY OF THESE, AND

159
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,764
IT'S TAKEN A BACKSEAT.

160
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:42,133
WE KIND OF LOOK TO CRIMINALIZE

161
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:42,767
POLITICAL BEHAVIOR.

162
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:44,736
THE FIRST ACCOUNTABILITY SHOULD

163
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:47,038
BE UP TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

164
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:47,606
THROUGH THEIR ELECTED

165
00:04:47,606 --> 00:04:48,073
REPRESENTATIVES.

166
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:48,940
TO BE >> Bret: THERE'S A LOT

167
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,508
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE START OF

168
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:51,343
THE INVESTIGATION AND THERE IS A

169
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:53,078
LOT THAT JUST DOES NOT ADD UP

170
00:04:53,078 --> 00:04:54,446
WITH THAT.

171
00:04:54,446 --> 00:04:55,380
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE

172
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,183
LOOKING AT IT, BUT CAPITOL HILL

173
00:04:58,183 --> 00:04:59,351
HASN'T COME TO THAT CONCLUSION,

174
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:01,519
EITHER.

175
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,956
>> AND TO QUOTE CHARLES CRAY

176
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:07,058
HOLMER, THIS IS ALL SMOKE AND NO

177
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:07,425
FIRE.

178
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:09,361
THAT'S WHAT WE KEEP TRACED

179
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,362
STOMACH CHASING.

180
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:11,429
I KEEP COMING BACK TO THE CORE

181
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:16,401
RATIO, DID ANYONE WORK WITH THE

182
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:21,039
EMAILS OR WORK WITH RICKY      W

183
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:21,072
EMAILS OR WORK WITH RICKY      K

188
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:21,439
EMAILS OR WORK WITH RICKY      O

189
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,174
DISSEMINATE THEM?

190
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:25,577
IF THE ANSWER IS NO, WHAT ARE WE

191
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:26,544
DOING?

192
00:05:26,544 --> 00:05:27,746
WHERE IS THIS GOING?

193
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:28,580
INDICTING PEOPLE FOR A FINANCIAL

194
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,248
FRAUD AND OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE

195
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:31,249
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

196
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:31,983
PRESIDENT.

197
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:33,285
FINE, BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO

198
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:36,154
WITH THE PRESIDENT.

199
00:05:36,154 --> 00:05:37,389
>> Bret: ANYTHING IN YOUR

200
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:39,791
ASSESSMENT OF THAT TRANSCRIPT OF

201
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,559
2500 PAGES FROM THE TRUMP TOWER

202
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,961
THAT STRUCK YOU THAT

203
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:43,628
DONALD TRUMP JR. DIDN'T KNOW

204
00:05:43,628 --> 00:05:47,032
WHETHER HIS DAD KNEW OR NOT?

205
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:49,301
>> THE INTEREST IN THIS MEETING,

206
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:53,004
OF COURSE, IS BECAUSE OF THE

207
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:54,372
QUESTION OF COLLUSION.

208
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:55,907
WHETHER TRUMP ASSOCIATES WERE

209
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:56,641
AMENABLE OR OPEN, RECEPTIVE TO

210
00:05:56,641 --> 00:06:00,545
ANY HELP FROM RUSSIAN AGENTS.

211
00:06:00,545 --> 00:06:04,749
AND WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHAT

212
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:06,051
DONALD TRUMP JR. KNEW OR DIDN'T

213
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:06,584
KNOW.

214
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:07,786
WE THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING

215
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:11,022
THAT HE SAID HE CAN REALLY TALK

216
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:13,391
TO HIS FATHER ABOUT IT.

217
00:06:13,391 --> 00:06:15,160
POUR IN VARIOUS EXCHANGES, AND

218
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,494
HE DIDN'T KNOW OR COULDN'T

219
00:06:16,494 --> 00:06:16,961
RECALL.

220
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,230
I THINK THIS PROVIDES A MORE

221
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,399
DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF THAT

222
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,767
MEETING, BUT STILL, I THINK

223
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,969
THERE ARE LOTS OF QUESTIONS.

224
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,971
I THINK THE BROADER QUESTION OF

225
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:28,773
COURSE IS, WHEN WILL THIS WRAP

226
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:30,942
UP AND WHAT WILL COME OF IT?

227
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:34,312
YOU'VE HAD LOTS OF INDICTMENTS

228
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:35,947
ON RUSSIAN MEDDLING OF COURSE,

229
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:37,515
BUT ON THE ISSUE OF COLLUSION,

230
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:38,950
YOU HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE ASKING

231
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,119
WHEN THIS WILL BE ANSWERED.

232
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:43,254
>> Bret: I WANT TO DO AROUND

233
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:44,122
ON NORTH KOREA.

234
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:47,859
>> WHILE MY THING IS, SPECIAL

235
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:49,728
COUNSEL IS CORRUPT AND THERE'S A

236
00:06:49,728 --> 00:06:52,163
REASON WE ARE AT THE STAGE AND

237
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:53,098
FINDING NO EVIDENCE GOING ON, SO

238
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:55,166
IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE GOT TO A

239
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:55,967
CONCLUSION.

240
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:57,635
AND I AGREE WITH CAITLIN, A LOT

241
00:06:57,635 --> 00:06:58,770
OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING TIRED BUT

242
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,405
THEY ARE NOT GETTING TIRED

243
00:07:00,405 --> 00:07:03,141
BECAUSE OF THE SEARCH, THEY ARE

244
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:03,775
NOT STOMACH GETTING TIRED

245
00:07:03,775 --> 00:07:05,176
BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE ANY HARD

246
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:06,344
EVIDENCE.

247
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:08,346
THEY ARE SPINNING THEIR WHEELS.

248
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:09,814
THE PAGES TODAY ARE SORT OF

249
00:07:09,814 --> 00:07:11,149
INTERESTING, THEY GIVE MORE

250
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:12,117
DETAIL AND GRANULARITY, BUT WE

251
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:15,387
KNEW FROM DONALD TRUMP JR.'S

252
00:07:15,387 --> 00:07:17,389
EMAIL WHAT HE WENT TO THIS

253
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:18,757
MEETING TO SEE.

254
00:07:18,757 --> 00:07:20,925
SO I'M NOT SURE THAT MATERIALLY

255
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:21,393
IT ADDS.

256
00:07:21,393 --> 00:07:23,561
WHAT WE REALLY DON'T KNOW IS WHY

257
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:24,763
AND WHEN THE FBI LAUNCHED THE

258
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:25,196
INVESTIGATION.

259
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:27,365
WE KNOW WHAT THEY SAY BUT WE ARE

260
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:28,166
NOT YET CLEAR ON WHY.

261
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:31,169
>> Bret: AND THE VACUUM OF ALL

262
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:33,004
THIS, THE PRESIDENT'S POLL

263
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:34,005
NUMBERS ARE GOING UP.

264
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:35,774
>> WHILE RIGHT.

265
00:07:35,774 --> 00:07:37,008
BUT THEY HAVEN'T FOUND ANY

266
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:37,709
EVIDENCE OF THE MAIN ATTACK

267
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:39,778
AGAINST HIM, SO YOU WOULD EXPECT

268
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:40,078
THAT.

269
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:42,380
PLUS IF THE ECONOMY IS GETTING

270
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,349
BETTER, WHY WOULDN'T IT GO UP?

271
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:45,316
>> Bret: NORTH KOREA, IT LOOKS

272
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:47,385
LIKE IT'S TOUCH AND GO ON TO

273
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:48,787
WHETHER THIS SUMMIT IS HAPPENING

274
00:07:48,787 --> 00:07:49,454
OR NOT.

275
00:07:49,454 --> 00:07:50,789
YOUR THOUGHTS, YOU'VE BEEN

276
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:51,790
AROUND THE BLOCK WITH THE

277
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,223
NORTH KOREANS.

278
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:54,292
THEY DON'T REALLY KEEP UP WITH

279
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,027
PROMISES ALL THE TIME.

280
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:58,396
>> I'VE BEEN A CYNIC ALL ALONG

281
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:00,365
BECAUSE I LOOKED THROUGH IT

282
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:01,366
BEFORE.

283
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:04,402
I'VE SEEN NORTH KOREA LIE AND

284
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:06,171
DECEIVE, SAY THEY WILL STOP

285
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:07,839
ENRICHING URANIUM ONLY TO START

286
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:08,373
ENRICHING PLUTONIUM.

287
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:09,874
THEY WILL SAY WE HAVE GOTTEN RID

288
00:08:09,874 --> 00:08:12,210
OF OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS BUT THEY

289
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:12,644
HAVE 50 MORE.

290
00:08:12,644 --> 00:08:15,780
THEY GET RID OF TEN AND KEEP 50.

291
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,981
THIS IS NORTH KOREA.

292
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:18,583
I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD

293
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,651
PROCEED WITH THE MILITARY DRILL

294
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:20,385
OF SOUTH KOREA.

295
00:08:20,385 --> 00:08:22,554
DO NOT BACK DOWN BECAUSE IF YOU

296
00:08:22,554 --> 00:08:23,988
BACKED DOWN 1 INCH, THEY WILL

297
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:25,623
ROLL ALL OVER YOU.

298
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:27,225
BE TOUGH AND FERMENT, AND I

299
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:28,793
EXPECT OF THE SUMMIT GOES ON, BE

300
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:30,028
TOUGH AND BE FIRM THERE.

301
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:31,029
BUT THE REAL ISSUE WILL BE

302
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:32,496
MONTHS AFTER AN AGREEMENT IF ONE

303
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:34,832
IS REACHED BECAUSE IN THE

304
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:37,134
HISTORY OF NORTH KOREA, THEY

305
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:38,436
SO THE PAGEANTRY OF AN AGREEMENT

306
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:40,038
IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS

307
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:42,307
NORTH KOREA DOING WHAT THEY SAY.

308
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:43,741
>> Bret: DOESN'T HAPPEN?

309
00:08:43,741 --> 00:08:45,043
>> IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THE

310
00:08:45,043 --> 00:08:45,810
PRESIDENT IS VERY CLEAR THAT HE

311
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,846
WANTS TO MAKE SOME KIND OF DEAL

312
00:08:47,846 --> 00:08:48,246
HERE.

313
00:08:48,246 --> 00:08:49,514
HE HASN'T DRIVEN IN LARGE PART

314
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:52,050
BY BEING ABLE TO DO THINGS.

315
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,554
HE SAYS THAT HIMSELF, AND HE HAS

316
00:08:56,554 --> 00:08:57,288
ALSO INVITED CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

317
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:58,456
THE KNOW ABOUT PEACE PRIZE.

318
00:08:58,456 --> 00:08:59,190
SO I'M WONDERING HOW THAT PLAYS

319
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,229
INTO HOW NORTH KOREA PLAYS INTO

320
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:09,367
THIS KNOWING THEY CAN EXERT

321
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:09,734
LEVERAGE.

322
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:12,170
>> Bret: PERCENTAGE OF

323
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,137
SINGAPORE, JUNE 12TH.

324
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:17,141
>> I THINK 90%, IT'S ALWAYS IN

325
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:18,176
THE NORTH KOREANS INTEREST TO

326
00:09:18,176 --> 00:09:18,543
MEET.

327
00:09:18,543 --> 00:09:20,845
THEY MAKE AN AGREEMENT THAT THEY

328
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:22,180
DON'T FREQUENTLY ABIDE BY.

329
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,382
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT

330
00:09:24,382 --> 00:09:25,984
OUR EYE ON THE BALL AND THE BALL

331
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:27,652
HERE IS NOT LETTING THEM GET TO

332
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:29,053
THE CAPACITY TO STRIKE THE

333
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:30,588
UNITED STATES WITH A NUCLEAR

334
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:31,322
SOUL.

335
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:33,591
AND IN A WAY, IT'S

336
00:09:33,591 --> 00:09:34,559
DONALD TRUMP'S REDLINE.

337
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,961
WHERE WE ARE, BECAUSE HE'S BEEN

338
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:39,964
TOUGH, I AM GLAD THAT JOHN

339
00:09:39,964 --> 00:00:00,000
BOLTON IS THERE.
