senior anti-corruption officer in the UK faces losing his job for alleged racism after saying that all police should be quote whiter than white a complaint about his comment was passed to the police watchdog for investigation meantime the officers been placed on restricted duties now the phrase whiter than white has been part of the English language for 500 years since the era of William Shakespeare no less and according to the oxford dictionary means morally beyond reproach this well-respected officer denies any wrongdoing and is cooperating fully with the investigation but a complaint was made saying that the language used by the officer was allegedly intended to deliberately offend in a racist way Ginetta Murray from the plain English campaign thinks the phrase was used in the correct way without any offensive intent if we look at just what the officer said and the context and the intent he was talking to fellow officers he was talking about how policing should be done and it should be morally beyond reproach I believe that he used the term whiter than white in the exact way that the dictionary definition explains it and I've looked at many dictionaries and that's the dictionary meaning so it seems ludicrous that the officer is the input under investigation and we have to ask ourselves are people having a pick up the language and its political correctness going to touch too far now well on top of this people have also pointed to potentially offensive language in computer coding debates now brewing after one of the most popular programming languages in the world decided to change the usual terms master and slave to parent and worker what do you think about that not everyone is happy with that decision some developers say there's never been an instance in programming with the master or slave terms were used in reference to human slavery technology analyst Roger Kay told us he thinks the language used it's harmless here in general to me this seems like a tempest in a teapot it's it's small community is using this terminology in a very specialized way it doesn't have anything to do with these other peoples let's call it trigger reactions to these words which are legitimate it's just the question you would do they even hear those words because if they're not talking to Python programmers when do they run into if I were the Python programming you know community I would just say leave us alone we use our own words we don't need anything much by it and we know what we're talking about it's a technical concept that's nothing to do with people who were shipped here from other countries you know enslavement you
