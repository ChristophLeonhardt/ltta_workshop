right but Democrats when they suggest that Trump's policies and his rhetoric are all of the peace that everyone who agrees with Trump on policy must be a racist what they are doing is driving away large segments of the American population they're making you choose you can either choose Trump's policies and his racism or you can choose Democratic policies and their non racism well what if I neglected to to make that choice what if I say I like a lot of Trump's policies but I don't like a lot of the things Trump says well Democrats say I'm not allowed to make that choice they've created this false dichotomy this false binary and I'm now supposed to fall into that trap the problem is that alienates voters right if you're a Democrat and you're saying that you should think twice about saying that you should think twice about saying that Trump is a racist not just because it's questionable as to whether Trump is actually a Richard Spencer type racist but also because if you're going to say Trump is a racist you need to say his comments are what make him a racist not his policies but Democrats aren't doing that they're just saying that Trump is a racist bully and the implication and I think that all Trump voters are reading into that I think a lot of people who are not even from voters I didn't vote for Trump and I'm reading into that I think what they are reading that when people say Trump is a racist what they're really saying is anyone who agrees with his immigration policy is a racist right they're using Trump as a proxy for anyone who agrees with Trump policies so in Elizabeth Warren says Trump is a racist bully she's actually I think painting Democrats into a dangerous corner ripping the American population by proxy Donald Trump is a racist bully and we know how to deal with bullies we do not back down we do not shut up we fight back and no matter what they throw at us nevertheless we persist nevertheless we person to of course there's her slogan who she wants to run for president again the idea that that Elizabeth Warren is gonna lead the fight against bigotry after using native of false Native American heritage allegedly to gain her job at Harvard Law School is beyond insane she's not the only person Democrats are trotting out again if you're going to go out and call Trump a racist you have to use non racist to call Trump a racist
