EVERYONE SHOULD REJECT. TUCKER. Tucker: TRACE GALLAGHER. THANKS A LOT FOR THAT. TODAY'S REPORT IS DAMNING. COULD IT HAVE BEEN WORSE WITH THE ORIGINAL FINDING SOFTENED UP PRIOR TO RELEASE? CONGRESSMAN JIM JORDAN REPUBLICAN WHO REPRESENTS OHIO. HE HAS INTRODUCED A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE DOJ TO RELEASE MORE DOCUMENTS ON THE DECISION-MAKING AT THE FBI IN 2015. HE JOINS US TONIGHT. CONGRESSMAN, THANKS A LOT FOR COMING ON. YOU BET. GOOD TO SEE YOU, TUCKER. Tucker: YOU SUSPECT THIS IS NOT ALL THERE IS. WE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR ALL KINDS OF DOCUMENTS. WE HAVE CAUGHT THEM HIDING DOCUMENTS. HOW ABOUT THE FACT, TUCKER, WE HAVE SEEN ALL THESE TEXT MESSAGES, THOUSANDS. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID, I FORGET, 50,000 TEXT MESSAGES BETWEEN STRZOK AND PAGE. THE ONE MOST TELLING WAS THE ONE THAT SAYS WE'LL STOP TRUMP. WE DON'T SEE THAT ONE UNTIL TODAY? SO, YEAH, THEY HAVEN'T COMPLIED WITH SUBPOENAS FROM CHAIRMAN GOODLATTE, SUBPOENAS FROM CHAIRMAN FUNDS. WE HAVE CAUGHT THEM TRYING TO HIDE INFORMATION FROM US. THEY KEPT THIS TEXT MESSAGE UNTIL TODAY. OF COURSE WE WANT THE INFORMATION SO WE CAN DO OUR JOB. LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS JUST REMEMBER IT WAS A COUPLE DAYS AGO THAT WE LEARNED THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN, WHO IN ESSENCE RUNS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE RIGHT NOW WAS THREATENING STAFF MEMBERS ON THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. SO WHEN YOU PUT ALL THIS TOGETHER, OF COURSE WE NEED A RESOLUTION SAYING GIVE US THE INFORMATION SO WE CAN DO OUR JOB AND GET ANSWERS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. Tucker: SO UNIDENTIFIED FBI LAWYER NUMBER TWO IN THIS DOCUMENT IS QUOTED LAMENTING THE FACT HE DIDN'T TRY HARDER TO GETS HILLARY CLINTON ELECTED AND BRAGGING ABOUT HIMSELF AS A MEMBER OF THE ANTI-TRUMP RESISTANCE AND HE GOES TO WORK FOR MUELLER. WHY DON'T I AS A CITIZEN HAVE A TRITE KNOW WHO THAT IS AND WHAT IS HE DOING NOW. I AGREE WITH YOU. IN FACT WE TWEETED HOW THE WHO IS LAWYER NUMBER TWO. WE WANT TO KNOW. LAWYER NUMBER TWO JUST LIKE STRZOK AND JUST LIKE PAGE WAS ON THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION. HE WAS THE LEAD LAWYER PRIMARY LAWYER ON THE TRUMP RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. ALL THREE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WENT ON THE MUELLER TEAM. SUBSEQUENTLY KICKED OFF THE MUELLER TEAM BECAUSE OF ANIMUS THEY HAD AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP. IT'S INTERESTING. THE THREE PEOPLE THAT COME OVER FROM THE FBI TO MUELLER'S TEAM ALL WERE ON THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION. ALL WERE ON THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION. ABDOMEN ALL HATED PRESIDENT TRUMP. THAT'S INTERESTING TO ME. SO, YEAH, WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHO THIS INDIVIDUAL IS AND BRING HIM IN. PLUS, ALSO WHAT IS INTERESTING, WE'LL STOP TRUMP. REMEMBER WHEN THIS HAPPENED. THIS IS A TEXT MESSAGE FROM AUGUST 8TH. SO PETER STRZOK OPENS THE TRUMP-RUSSIA INVESTIGATION ON JULY 31ST, 8 DAYS LATER, WE'LL STOP TRUMP. SIX DAYS LATER WE HAVE THE TEXT MESSAGE. WE HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY TO MAKE SURE IF THAT DOESN'T SHOW WHERE THESE GUYS WERE AT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES.
