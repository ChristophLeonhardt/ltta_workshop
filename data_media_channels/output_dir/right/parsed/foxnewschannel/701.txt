>> Bret: WELCOME BACK TO
ORLANDO.
NOW WE START THE LIGHTNING
ROUND.
QUICK ANSWERS HERE FROM EACH
CANDIDATE, 30 SECONDS EACH.
>> Martha: RIGHT NOW,
PROTESTING THE GOVERNOR’S
RESPONSE TO HURRICANE MARIA.
PUERTO RICANS NOW OUTNUMBER
AMERICANS, THEY COULD SWING THE
ELECTION.
>> Congressman DeSANTIS: THE
CONGRESSWOMAN HAS ENDORSED ME
FOR GOVERNOR HERE IN FLORIDA AND
WE WILL TAKE THE CASE TO THE
PUERTO RICAN COMMUNITY.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY SERVE IN OUR MILITARY MORE
THAN ANY OTHER GROUP.
THEY CARE ABOUT EDUCATION AND
WORK AS HARD AS ANYBODY.
THEY ARE NATURAL REPUBLICANS, WE
JUST HAVE TO TAKE A GOOD SOLID
CONSERVATIVE MESSAGE, DON’T
WATER IT DOWN, AND JENNIFER AND
I WILL BE THERE ALONGSIDE
GOVERNOR SCOTT AND WE WILL DO
VERY WELL AND CENTRAL FLORIDA
WITH OUR PUERTO RICAN FRIENDS.
>> Commissioner Putnam: WHILE
ANYONE WHO CAME TO FLORIDA,
ESPECIALLY IN OSCEOLA COUNTY,
FLORIDA KNOWS WE ROLLED OUT THE
WELCOME MAT FOR OUR FRIENDS FROM
LIVE THROUGH HURRICANES.
WE WELCOME THEM INTO OUR
SCHOOLS, PROVIDED HOUSING AND
GAVE THEM OPPORTUNITIES TO GET
THEIR LIVES BACK TO NORMAL.
FLORIDA IS A GREAT NEIGHBOR TO
OUR NEIGHBORS IN PUERTO RICO AND
WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE.
THEY CARE ABOUT SMALL
BUSINESSES.
THEY CARE ABOUT FAITH.
THEY CARE ABOUT FAMILY AND
WILL SUPPORT REPUBLICANS IN 18
AND 2,020.
>> Bret: CONGRESSMAN,
ON WHETHER OR NOT TO LEGALIZE
NOW THERE’S A PUSH TO LEGALIZE
RECREATIONAL USE HERE AS WELL.
A FEDERALIST.
I BELIEVE STATES KNOW WHAT’S
BEST FOR THEIR STATES AND I
DON’T WANT THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT DICTATING EVERY
POLICY.
I’M NOT IN FAVOR OF FLORIDA OF
DOING RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA
BECAUSE I REMEMBER IN
HIGH SCHOOL THAT WAS THE NUMBER
ONE REASON WHY SOME OF THE
PEOPLE I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH
WELL IN SPORTS.
BUT I AM SUPPORTIVE, THE FACT
THAT VOTERS MADE A DECISION
ABOUT MEDICAL MARIJUANA.
I WANTED IMPLEMENTED BUT I DON’T
WANT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
COMING IN AND PROSECUTING PEOPLE
THAT ARE ACTING CONSISTENTLY
WITH STATE LAW.
>> Commissioner Putnam: 70% OF
FLORIDIANS SUPPORTED MEDICAL
BUT AS A DAD AND AN EMPLOYER, I
DON’T WANT FLORIDA TO JEOPARDIZE
OUR FAMILY-FRIENDLY IMAGE AND BE
MARIJUANA.
IT’S NOT WHO WE WANT TO BE.
HERE WE ARE AND THE MOST
FAMILY-FRIENDLY DESTINATION ON
EARTH, THAT’S NOT WHO WE WANT TO
BE.
WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT.
ENFORCED MEDICAL, BUT DON’T GO
>> Martha: GENTLEMEN, EACH
CANDIDATE WILL HAVE TIME FOR A
BRIEF CLOSING STATEMENT AND WE
BEGIN WITH CONGRESSMAN
DeSANTIS.
>> Congressman DeSANTIS:
THANK YOU FOX, AND LET ME THANK
MY WIFE CASEY WHO IS THERE.
CONSERVATIVE AND I’M ENDORSED BY
THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES, DONALD TRUMP, TO
BE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF
FLORIDA.
I THINK WE HAVE A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD OFF OF THE
JOB OPPORTUNITIES, REFORMING OUR
EDUCATION SYSTEM INCLUDING
OPPOSING COMMON CORE AND
APPOINTING CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES
TO THE STATE SUPREME COURT.
BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET THAT
DONE IF WE LET THE INSIDERS IN
TALLAHASSEE CHOOSE AND GO BACK
TO THE DAY IS LIKE IT WAS WITH
CHARLIE CRIST WHEN ALL THE GOOD
OLD BOYS RAN THE SHOW.
FOR YOUR VOTE.
THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.
>> Bret: COMMISSIONER PUTNAM?
>> Commissioner Putnam: WE ARE
BLESSED TO LIVE IN A STATE THAT
PEOPLE DREAM ABOUT VISITING FOR
JUST A FEW DAYS.
WE LIVE IN A STATE THAT PEOPLE
FLORIDA, FOR THEM, IS A PRIZE.
A REWARD FOR A LIFE WELL LIVED
A PRIZE BUT YOU MUST BE PRESENT
TO WIN.
I AM A FARMER, I’M A SMALL
BUSINESS OWNER.
I KNOW OUR STATE BEST AND I WILL
ALWAYS PUT FLORIDA FIRST.
>> Bret: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Martha: GENTLEMEN,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING
TONIGHT IS JUST BEGINNING.
