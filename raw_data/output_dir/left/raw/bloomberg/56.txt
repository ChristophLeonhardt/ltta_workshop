00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,650
Back in the 1990s, Portugal faced a heroin
crisis.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,130
One in a hundred people were using the drug.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,480
It took something drastic to turn things around.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,000
Here’s how Portugal kicked the habit

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,400
While the Western World experienced the social
and cultural revolution of the sixties

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,820
Portugal was kept isolated by the dictator Antonio Salazar.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:35,040
In 1974, the Carnation Revolution overthrew
his oppressive Estado Novo regime and the

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,940
Portuguese people were suddenly exposed to
newfound freedoms.

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,760
“Censorship was at an end, freedom of speech
restored, elections promised and most important

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,040
of all, the end of portugal’s colonial wars
in Africa”

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,190
This was the catalyst that would lead to Portugal’s
problem.

12
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,580
Attitudes towards drugs and experimentation
were relaxed.

13
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,469
At the same time, the population grew, with
up to a million people arriving from the colonies,

14
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:05,280
just as the country fell into a severe economic
depression.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,250
As if on cue, cheap heroin from Afghanistan
and Pakistan flooded Europe.

16
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,600
While most countries had experience fighting
drugs,

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,179
the new, liberal Portugal wasn’t prepared.

18
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:20,079
By the nineties an estimated one percent of
the population was using heroin.

19
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:27,499
"It was almost impossible to find a single
family in Portugal that had no problems connected

20
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:28,499
to drugs."

21
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:33,439
Doctor João Goulão formed part of a team
of healthcare professionals to re-think how

22
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,729
Portugal dealt with drugs.

23
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,759
Feeling like they had nothing to lose, their
solution was radical.

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,080
On July 1st 2001, Portugal became the first
country in the world

25
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,960
to decriminalize all drugs.

26
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:51,889
What that means is while they remain illegal,
possessing small amounts of anything from

27
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:57,079
cannabis to cocaine, or even heroin doesn’t result in arrest.

28
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,179
Users aren’t considered as criminals but
rather treated as patients in a health-first

29
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:02,950
approach.

30
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,950
Instead of facing a judge, they meet a “dissuasion
panel” made up of lawyers, social workers

31
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,490
and medics.

32
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:15,450
Before decriminalization around 90% of funds
spent on fighting drugs went on enforcement

33
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,990
and just 10% on healthcare.

34
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,750
After 2001, that was reversed.

35
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,940
Critics claimed the change in law might encourage
users and even attract drug tourists.

36
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,900
And there is some evidence that suggests small
increases in reported drug use.

37
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,960
But advocates of decriminalization say that
drug users are more likely to find help if

38
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,310
they know they won’t be locked up.

39
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,800
The number of Portuguese in rehab programmes
rose from just over 6,000 in 1999 to

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,220
nearly 26,000 in 2008.

41
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,980
While those using heroin has fallen, from
about 100,000 to around 50,000 today.

42
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,950
And drug-related deaths have fallen dramatically.

43
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,810
In 2015 Portugal had just six deaths per million
people, the lowest in Western Europe and a

44
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,730
tiny fraction of that in the U.S..

45
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,230
The numbers show just how remarkable Portugal’s
turnaround has been.

46
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,050
Due to its geography it serves as a gateway
for trafficking into Europe, so stamping out

47
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,140
drugs just isn’t realistic.

48
00:03:16,140 --> 00:00:00,000
Instead, it’s shown that a humane and health-led
approach can be much less damaging to society.
