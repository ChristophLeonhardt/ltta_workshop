the US has resumed funding for the controversial Syrian aid group the white helmets the Trump administration had decided to freeze funding for the rescue organization back in March as part of a broader programme of cuts the State Department says that it's releasing six point six million dollars in aid which will be split between the group and an independent UN agency investigating war crimes in Syria the department also claims the white helmets have saved over a hundred thousand lives in Syria including victims of the state's alleged chemical attacks but despite having Washington support and maintaining that they are neutral in the conflict the Syrian first responders have a dubious reputation in the past its members appear to have been caught on camera flying an al-qaeda flag they've also been seen at the site of executions by Islamist militants the rescuers staged an operation as well as that call the monican challenge which people have criticized them for doing making light of the situation there and the white helmets only operate in rebel-held areas of syria often in close proximity to terrorist groups anti-war activist mike riley told us why he thinks the US has decided to continue funding the self-styled first responders the pentagon planners have probably finally realized just how important the white helmets are to the regime change operation the fact that they've been so successful in providing fake imagery and fake evidence and carrying out chemical weapons attacks themselves and then apportioning responsibility to the assad forces just means that they can be relied upon whenever there's a need or a pretext that's needed for another missile attack or even a more full-scale invasion the white helmets are the go-to guys because they are there they are there right next to working alongside al Qaeda and affiliated groups this is why the the media they're such favorites with the media that's why they won the Ross case why they were nominated for a Nobel Prize the actual concept itself of the white helmets has to be protected at all costs if they were impartial then they would be civilians out of wreckage when terrorists have fired their hell cannons into civilian areas and civilian buildings but they're never seen there they're never seen in government-held areas they are only seen in terrorist occupied areas where terrorists have got civilians held as captives and as human shields and what we see is when when there is light in the case of eastern Guto and boomer the terrorists left in the green buses and they went north to wit lib the white helmets followed them the white helmets went with them so the white helmets are inseparable from the terrorists much of the even the equipment that they're alleged to have used has been either donated or stolen from the real serious civil defense which is an established organization going back to the 1960s registered with the international body that looks after the Civil Defence units across the world though that real civil defense has become a target of the white helmets their operatives have been killed by white helmets and their equipment has been stolen so it begs the question what do they need this money for I think we know the answer and the answer is it's going via the white helmets straight towards the terroristic factions like al-nusrah like our dinky and probably even on to Isis themselves you
