I like to push myself and have the confidence in my abilities and believe in myself and doing you a dive off the top of the cage that I think it was 45 a lot of is just preparation you know don't let yourself get completely out of shape to when something that comes up you can't do it how do I do it it's not like I'm in the gym five hours a day how I don't even hold even go to the gym anymore I love you know riding my bike for long distances but but other than that I think it really is a personable train if the gene Simmons principle has always looked like a star aka always look your best always try to do something that makes you look a little bit better a little bit of balance to pep in your step a few years ago to the Paleo diet with a caveman diet all you do is just eat berries nuts meats eggs stuff that you can call from the land it's great works like a charm but after about four or five months and you start losing your mind it's like is it really worth it if I want to have a cookie I'm not gonna fricking you know purge myself because I enjoyed a hamburger to me there really is no diet it just said if I start feeling a little bit bigger I'll cut down if I start being feeling like a little bit too cut up then I'll you know eat a little bit more you don't need a diet book or a doctor just be smart and don't eat seafood that's basically it and if you do don't make it a habit we're living in a world now where we're you know the proverbial age is just a number I think it really is whereas maybe 10 20 30 years ago when you got to a certain age you had to punch your card and that was done if you have a positive outlook it opens up so many avenues naik includes mentally and physically
