to all the women and especially the
young women who put their faith in this
campaign and in me I want you to know
that nothing has made me prouder than to
be your champion
I I know I know we have still not
shattered that highest and hardest glass
ceiling but someday someone will and
hopefully sooner than we might think
right now and to all the little girls
who are watching this never doubt that
you are valuable and powerful and
deserving of every chance and
opportunity in the world to pursue and
achieve your own dreams
