00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:08,835
AINSLEY: THE BOY SCOUTS OF

2
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:09,937
AMERICA MAKING A MAJOR

3
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:10,904
CHANGE DROPPING BOY FROM

4
00:00:10,904 --> 00:00:11,939
THEIR TITLE.

5
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:13,173
OPTING FOR A MORE JUSTICE

6
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:15,175
CENTER NEUTRAL NAME SCOUTS

7
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:16,443
BSA AND THAT STARTS NEXT

8
00:00:16,443 --> 00:00:17,778
YEAR, BRIAN.

9
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:18,412
BRIAN: SOUNDS LIKE A JOKE,

10
00:00:18,412 --> 00:00:19,279
DOESN'T IT?

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,814
OUR NEXT GUEST SAYS HE WON'T

12
00:00:20,814 --> 00:00:22,015
LET HIS SONS ANYWHERE NEAR

13
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:22,950
THE ORGANIZATION NOW AND

14
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,218
INSTEAD USE THIS TO TEACH

15
00:00:24,218 --> 00:00:25,752
THEM A LESSON ABOUT TRUTH

16
00:00:25,752 --> 00:00:27,688
AND REASON AND LOGIC.

17
00:00:27,688 --> 00:00:29,690
MATT WALSH IS WITH THE DAILY

18
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,524
WIRE.COM AND AUTHOR OF THIS

19
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:33,360
BOOK "THE UNHOLY TRINITY"

20
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,795
BLOCKING THE LEFT'S ASSAULT

21
00:00:34,795 --> 00:00:35,929
ON LIFE, MARRIAGE AND

22
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:36,263
GENDER.

23
00:00:36,263 --> 00:00:37,998
SOME SAY HEY, WHAT'S THE BIG

24
00:00:37,998 --> 00:00:38,332
DEAL?

25
00:00:38,332 --> 00:00:39,733
MATT, I THINK THIS IS A BIG

26
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:41,101
DEAL BECAUSE THERE IS THIS

27
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:42,035
THING CALLED THE GIRL SCOUTS

28
00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:43,170
THAT ARE GOING TO SUFFER

29
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,438
FROM THAT AND I THINK THERE

30
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:45,606
IS A REASON WHY THE

31
00:00:45,606 --> 00:00:46,540
CURRICULUM IS DIFFERENT.

32
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:46,873
DO YOU?

33
00:00:46,873 --> 00:00:47,808
>> YEAH.

34
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:48,809
BECAUSE THIS IS A CURRICULUM

35
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,143
FOR BOYS AND BOYS ARE

36
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:50,844
DIFFERENT THAN GIRLS.

37
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:52,679
I KNOW THIS IS A TRUTH THAT

38
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:54,147
UPSETS PEOPLE THESE DAYS

39
00:00:54,147 --> 00:00:56,350
BECAUSE EYE OBVIOUS TRUTH

40
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:56,783
DOES.

41
00:00:56,783 --> 00:00:59,753
BOYS ARE DIFFERENT THAN

42
00:00:59,753 --> 00:01:00,087
GIRLS.

43
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:00,787
CONCERNED ABOUT THE MORAL

44
00:01:00,787 --> 00:01:02,189
FORMATION OF BOYS AND MAKING

45
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:02,889
BOYS INTO MEN.

46
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:03,924
WELL THEN YOU NEED TO

47
00:01:03,924 --> 00:01:04,891
SEPARATE THEM FROM GIRLS AND

48
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:06,560
GIVE THEM A DIFFERENT SORT

49
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,861
OF EXPERIENCE AND SO IT IS A

50
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:08,395
BIG DEAL.

51
00:01:08,395 --> 00:01:09,696
HAVE YOU THIS ICONIC

52
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:10,764
AMERICAN ORGANIZATION WHICH

53
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:12,766
IS NOW DESTROYED ITSELF

54
00:01:12,766 --> 00:01:14,735
BENDING TO THE WHIMS OF THE

55
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:16,837
P.C. LIFTEDDIST MOB AND THIS

56
00:01:16,837 --> 00:01:18,272
IS A LESSON FOR EVERYONE.

57
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:19,706
I WILL USE THIS AS A LESSON

58
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:21,508
FOR MY SONS TO SHOW THEM,

59
00:01:21,508 --> 00:01:22,509
YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE

60
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:23,443
STANDING ON TRUTH AND

61
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:25,679
STANDING ON A FIRM GROUND OF

62
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:27,314
MORAL TRUTH, AND YOU START

63
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:29,516
GIVING UP INCHES AND START

64
00:01:29,516 --> 00:01:30,450
SURRENDERING, THEN BEFORE

65
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,585
LONG THERE IS NOTHING LEFT.

66
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:33,053
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH

67
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:36,023
THE BOY SCOUTS AT THIS

68
00:01:36,023 --> 00:01:36,556
POINT.

69
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:37,257
AINSLEY: OUR PRODUCERS WERE

70
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:38,492
TELLING US DURING THE

71
00:01:38,492 --> 00:01:39,326
COMMERCIAL BREAK WRITING IN

72
00:01:39,326 --> 00:01:40,494
THIS IS THE END TROUGH

73
00:01:40,494 --> 00:01:40,861
ADDITION.

74
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:42,296
MOST OF OUR VIEWERS ARE

75
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:43,330
FURIOUS ABOUT THIS SAYING

76
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,931
MEN NEED TO LEARN HOW TO BE

77
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:47,367
MEN IN ORDER TO LEARN HOW TO

78
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:48,702
TREAT A WOMAN CORRECTLY.

79
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:49,770
YOU SAY YOU ARE KEEPING YOUR

80
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,672
SONS AWAY FROM IT NOW?

81
00:01:51,672 --> 00:01:52,639
WHY IS THAT?

82
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:53,307
>> COMPLETELY SACRIFICED

83
00:01:53,307 --> 00:01:53,974
THEIR IDENTITY.

84
00:01:53,974 --> 00:01:55,208
I DON'T WANT MY SON -- THIS

85
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,076
IS A WRONG EXAMPLE.

86
00:01:56,076 --> 00:01:57,110
I DON'T WANT MY SON TO BE

87
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,578
ASSOCIATED WITH AN

88
00:01:58,578 --> 00:01:59,913
ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD GIVE

89
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:02,049
UP ITS IDENTITY AND ITS

90
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:04,251
MISSION WHICH WAS A GOOD,

91
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:04,818
POSITIVE MISSION JUST

92
00:02:04,818 --> 00:02:06,253
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE UPSET.

93
00:02:06,253 --> 00:02:07,587
THAT'S THE WRONG MESSAGE.

94
00:02:07,587 --> 00:02:10,122
I WANT MY SONS TO KNOW

95
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:10,723
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

96
00:02:10,723 --> 00:02:11,425
AINSLEY: I CAN UNDERSTAND IF

97
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:12,225
WE DIDN'T HAVE A GIRL SCOUT.

98
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:13,360
IF YOU ARE A GIRL AND WANT

99
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,494
TO BE PART OF THE SCOUTS,

100
00:02:14,494 --> 00:02:16,463
THEN YOU JOIN THE GIRL

101
00:02:16,463 --> 00:02:16,797
SCOUTS.

102
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:17,564
IF YOU ARE A BOY, YOU JOIN

103
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:18,265
THE BOY SCOUTS.

104
00:02:18,265 --> 00:02:20,067
THERE IS ONE FOR EACH.

105
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:21,134
>> EXACTLY.

106
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:22,202
ALWAYS SEEMS TO KIND OF GO

107
00:02:22,202 --> 00:02:23,904
THIS WAY WHERE WE TAKE AWAY

108
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:24,905
ALL THE SPACES THAT ARE FOR

109
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:26,273
BOYS AND WE STILL LET GIRLS

110
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:27,107
HAVE SPACES.

111
00:02:27,107 --> 00:02:30,477
SO IT'S LIKE IN REC LEAGUES

112
00:02:30,477 --> 00:02:32,179
WHILE THE GIRLS CAN PLAY

113
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:33,814
WITH THE BOYS THEY ALSO HAVE

114
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:34,514
SOFTBALL TEAM.

115
00:02:34,514 --> 00:02:35,649
BOYS CAN'T PLAY ON THE

116
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:37,284
SOFTBALL TEAM.

117
00:02:37,284 --> 00:02:38,885
GIRLS CAN HAVE THEIR SPACE

118
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:40,354
AND BOYS CAN'T HAVE THEIRS.

119
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:42,255
WE ARE DEPRIVING SOMETHING,

120
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:43,457
TAKING AWAY FROM BOYS THEY

121
00:02:43,457 --> 00:02:44,691
DON'T NEED.

122
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:45,459
BRIAN: LOT OF MILITARY COMES

123
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:46,093
FROM SCOUTING.

124
00:02:46,093 --> 00:02:47,260
THEY HAVE THAT BACKGROUND

125
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,029
AND LEARN SOME VALUABLE

126
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:50,030
LESSONS THERE AT LOVE PEOPLE

127
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,964
DON'T LIKE SPORTS BUT WANT

128
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:52,866
TO BE INVOLVED IN

129
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:53,667
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES

130
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:54,501
AND TIME TO BOND AND FORM

131
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:54,968
THAT TEAM.

132
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:57,838
DO YOU THINK THIS COULD BE

133
00:02:57,971 --> 00:02:59,840
ENROLLMENT IS DOWN FROM BOY

134
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,774
SCOUTS GOING TO TRY TO SUCK

135
00:03:00,774 --> 00:03:02,075
THEM FROM THE GIRL SCOUTS?

136
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:03,310
>> I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY

137
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:03,844
PART OF IT.

138
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:05,812
WHY IS ENROLLMENT DOWN?

139
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:07,047
ENROLLMENT IS DOWN BECAUSE

140
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:08,415
THEY STARTING GIVING UP WHO

141
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:09,316
THEY'RE.

142
00:03:09,316 --> 00:03:12,018
THEY STARTED GETTING AWAY

143
00:03:12,018 --> 00:03:13,153
FROM FUNDAMENTAL MISSION

144
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:14,087
WHICH ORIGINALLY WAS THIS

145
00:03:14,087 --> 00:03:14,521
WAS FOR BOYS.

146
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:15,655
IT IS A CHRISTIAN

147
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:16,089
ORGANIZATION.

148
00:03:16,089 --> 00:00:00,000
THE MORE THEY GET AWAY FROM
