ONE AFTER THE OTHER CAME OUT,

00:00:34,088 --> 00:00:36,757
EVEN SINCE MY SIT DOWN WITH JOHN

17
00:00:36,757 --> 00:00:37,658
BOLTON, HILLARY CLINTON JUST

18
00:00:37,658 --> 00:00:39,193
WAITING IRAN IS NOW MORE

19
00:00:39,193 --> 00:00:39,660
DANGEROUS.

20
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,128
SHE SAID ANYONE WHO THINKS

21
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:42,229
BOMBING IS THE ANSWER IS

22
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:45,866
WOEFULLY MISINFORMED ET CETERA,

23
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:46,767
ET CETERA.

24
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:48,168
I DIDN'T PUT THE WHOLE THING UP

25
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:49,470
THERE.

26
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,638
JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER CIA

27
00:00:51,638 --> 00:00:52,773
DIRECTOR, SIMULTANEOUSLY THE

28
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:54,274
PRESIDENT LIED ABOUT THE IRAN

29
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:56,477
NUKE DEAL, UNDERMINE GLOBAL

30
00:00:56,477 --> 00:00:57,244
CONFIDENCE IN THE U.S.

31
00:00:57,244 --> 00:00:58,979
COMMITMENT, ALIENATED OUR

32
00:00:58,979 --> 00:00:59,813
ALLIES.

33
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:01,548
THIS IS A DANGER TO AMERICA'S

34
00:01:01,548 --> 00:01:02,282
NATIONAL SECURITY.

35
00:01:02,282 --> 00:01:03,984
OBAMA SAME THING, ONE AFTER THE

36
00:01:03,984 --> 00:01:06,186
OTHER AFTER THE OTHER AND YOU

37
00:01:06,186 --> 00:01:06,687
SAY?

38
00:01:06,687 --> 00:01:08,355
>> ISRAEL DISAGREES AND THIS IS

39
00:01:08,355 --> 00:01:09,056
SOMETHING THAT UNITES ISRAELIS

40
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:12,459
ACROSS THE SPECTRUM.

41
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:14,094
THE PRIME MINISTER GAVE A FULL

42
00:01:14,094 --> 00:01:14,795
THROATED ENDORSEMENT TO WHAT

43
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:17,297
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID TODAY.

44
00:01:17,297 --> 00:01:19,066
THERE WERE PEOPLE THREE YEARS

45
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:20,701
AGO WHO SAID THIS DEAL WAS

46
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:21,668
ACTUALLY GOING TO PUSH MORE

47
00:01:21,668 --> 00:01:22,403
FURTHER AWAY AND IF YOU DIDN'T

48
00:01:22,403 --> 00:01:23,604
DO THIS DEAL THAN IT WAS GOING

49
00:01:23,604 --> 00:01:26,373
TO BRING MORE CLOSER.

50
00:01:26,373 --> 00:01:27,608
THE EXACT OPPOSITE HAS HAPPENED.

51
00:01:27,608 --> 00:01:29,176
WE ARGUED THEN THAT THIS DEAL,

52
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:30,878
BY GIVING ALL OF THESE BILLIONS

53
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:32,946
OF DOLLARS TO IRAN WAS GOING TO

54
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:34,281
FUEL IRAN'S WAR MACHINE AND WE

55
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:36,450
WOULD SEE ITS EFFECTS IN THE

56
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:36,850
MIDDLE EAST.

57
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,685
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU HAVE

58
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:39,420
SEEN OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS

59
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,823
IN IRAQ, AND SYRIA, AND LEBANON,

60
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:43,424
IN YEMEN.

61
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,224
IRAN IS FAR MORE DANGEROUS TODAY

62
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:47,294
BECAUSE OF THIS DEAL.

63
00:01:47,294 --> 00:01:49,363
THE CHANCES OF WAR ARE MUCH

64
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:50,898
HIGHER BECAUSE OF HIS DEAL.

65
00:01:50,898 --> 00:01:53,434
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID TODAY

66
00:01:53,434 --> 00:01:55,602
IS HE TOOK A DEAL THAT BASICALLY

67
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:57,438
PUTS US ALL ON CRUISE CONTROL

68
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:58,172
HEADING OVER A CLIFF BECAUSE IN

69
00:01:58,172 --> 00:02:01,809
A FEW YEARS ALL OF THOSE

70
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:02,976
RESTRICTIONS WILL BE REMOVED AND

71
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:04,678
IRAN DOESN'T HAVE TO SNEAK IN OR

72
00:02:04,678 --> 00:02:05,779
BREAKING TO THE NUCLEAR CLUB,

73
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:07,214
THEY CAN JUST WALK IN.

74
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:08,482
HE TURNED THE WHEEL.

75
00:02:08,482 --> 00:02:09,850
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S NOT

76
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,918
MORE CHALLENGES BUT AT LEAST WE

77
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:12,419
KNOW WE ARE NOT HEADING OFF A

78
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:14,221
CLIFF AND RIGHT NOW WHAT ISRAEL

79
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:17,090
IS DEALING WITH OUR ACUTE

80
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:17,724
SECURITY CHALLENGES THAT

81
00:02:17,724 --> 00:02:18,992
ACTUALLY INCREASE IN THE WAKE OF

82
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:19,359
THE DEAL.

83
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:20,461
IT MIGHT BE THE PEOPLE IN

84
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:22,629
BRITAIN AND IN FRANCE AND IN

85
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:23,363
GERMANY WHO THINK THE WORLD IS

86
00:02:23,363 --> 00:02:25,065
SAFE BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY

87
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:27,801
WERE THE GUINEA PIGS IN THIS

88
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:30,671
ARABS WHO CAME OUT BOTH --

89
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:33,974
>> Laura: THE SAUDIS CAME OUT

90
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:36,243
BIG TIME AND SUPPORT, OTHER ARAB

91
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:36,910
NATIONS.

92
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,412
>> THE EMIRATES GAVE A PUBLIC

93
00:02:38,412 --> 00:02:39,713
ENDORSEMENT OF THIS BECAUSE THEY

94
00:02:39,713 --> 00:02:41,215
HAVE SEEN THE CONSEQUENCES FOR

95
00:02:41,215 --> 00:02:41,949
THEIR OWN COUNTRY.

96
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:43,650
AS I'VE SAID FOR YEARS, WHEN

97
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,585
ISRAELIS AND ARABS ARE ON THE

98
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:45,853
SAME PAGE, PEOPLE SHOULD PAY

99
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:46,420
ATTENTION.

100
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,388
WE WERE THE GUINEA PIGS IN THIS

101
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:48,989
EXPERIMENT.

102
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:50,457
IT HAS GONE VERY WRONG AND WE

103
00:02:50,457 --> 00:02:52,359
ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR

104
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:54,061
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR MAKING THIS

105
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:55,095
COURAGEOUS DECISION TO SHIFT

106
00:02:55,095 --> 00:02:57,264
COURSE AND WE HOPE THAT OTHER

107
00:02:57,264 --> 00:02:58,499
PARTIES NOW WILL UNITE BEHIND

108
00:02:58,499 --> 00:03:00,067
HIS LEADERSHIP AND ACTUALLY GET

109
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:01,368
A DEAL THAT WILL PREVENT IRAN

110
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:04,571
FROM EVER DEVELOPING.

111
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:05,205
>> Laura: ALL OF THESE

112
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:08,008
DEMOCRATS LIKE SCHUMER AND

113
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:08,742
MENENDEZ, ALL OF THESE PEOPLE

114
00:03:08,742 --> 00:03:10,811
WHO WERE SAYING DON'T HOW ROTTEN

115
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:11,712
THE IRAN DEAL WAS WHEN OBAMA WAS

116
00:03:11,712 --> 00:03:13,013
ABOUT TO ENTER INTO IT.

117
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:14,081
NOW YOU DON'T HEAR SO MUCH FROM

118
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:14,381
THEM.

119
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:16,183
BY THE WAY, I KNOW YOU ARE GOING

120
00:03:16,183 --> 00:03:18,785
TO BE THRILLED TO HEAR THAT RT,

121
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:21,221
RUSSIAN TELEVISION WEBSITE IS

122
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:22,456
SAYING THE ISRAEL LOBBY IS

123
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:24,124
CALLING THE SHOTS IN TRUMP'S

124
00:03:24,124 --> 00:03:25,292
ROLLBACK POLICY ON IRAN.

125
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:27,594
MAX BLUMENTHAL, WHO I KNOW YOU

126
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:28,595
KNOW WELL.

127
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:30,197
PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHO HAS BEEN

128
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:31,231
CAMPAIGNING FOR YEARS AGAINST

129
00:03:31,231 --> 00:03:32,266
THIS DEAL, APPARENTLY YOU ARE

130
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,567
THE ONE CALLING THE SHOTS.

131
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,402
IT'S EITHER JOHN BOLTON CALLING

132
00:03:35,402 --> 00:03:37,271
THE SHOTS WERE THE ISRAEL LOBBY

133
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:37,971
CALLING THE SHOTS EVEN THOUGH

134
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:40,307
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

135
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:41,608
SINGLE-MINDEDLY FOCUSED ON THIS

136
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:42,409
ISSUE FOR YEARS.

137
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:43,810
>> IT'S BEEN NO SECRET WHAT

138
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,511
ISRAEL'S POSITION HAS BEEN ON

139
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:46,980
THIS DEAL.

140
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,382
THE PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL

141
00:03:48,382 --> 00:03:49,783
CAME TO CONGRESS AND SPOKE UP

142
00:03:49,783 --> 00:03:50,584
AGAINST THIS DEAL AND WHAT HE

143
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:53,053
SAID AT THE TIME, PEOPLE SHOULD

144
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:53,787
REMEMBER, IS THE DANGER OF THE

145
00:03:53,787 --> 00:03:55,289
DEAL IS NOT THAT IRAN IS GOING

146
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:56,857
TO VIOLATE IT, IT'S THAT THEY

147
00:03:56,857 --> 00:03:58,492
CAN KEEP THIS DEAL AND WALK INTO

148
00:03:58,492 --> 00:04:01,194
AN ENTIRE NUCLEAR ARSENAL.

149
00:04:01,194 --> 00:00:00,000
WHAT THE PRIME MINISTERS SHOWED
