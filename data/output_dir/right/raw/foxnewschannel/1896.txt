1
00:00:00,958 --> 00:00:03,294
DISASTER IN 2010 THAT KILLED 29

2
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:04,962
PEOPLE AND WHETHER HE VIOLATED

3
00:00:04,962 --> 00:00:06,297
SAFETY RULES AND STANDARDS.

4
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:07,998
LONG STORY SHORT,

5
00:00:07,998 --> 00:00:09,767
MR. BLANKENSHIP WAS NOT A BIG

6
00:00:09,767 --> 00:00:12,269
FAN OF THE EVENTUAL REPUBLICAN

7
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,438
NOMINEE, MR. MORRISEY WHO WE'LL

8
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:16,006
TALK TO AND SEEMED TO HINT THAT

9
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:17,641
HE MIGHT THROW HIS SUPPORT BY

10
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:20,110
THE INCUMBENT DEMOCRATIC

11
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,745
SENATOR, JOE MANCHIN.

12
00:00:21,745 --> 00:00:23,247
MANCHIN INDICATING RIGHT NOW ONE

13
00:00:23,247 --> 00:00:25,449
WAY OR THE OTHER, THAT DOESN'T

14
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:25,783
MATTER.

15
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:27,518
HE WANTS PEOPLE TO VOTE THEIR

16
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:28,819
CONSCIOUS BUT DIDN'T RULE OUT

17
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:30,988
THE POSSIBILITY THAT THAT MIGHT

18
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:31,288
HELP.

19
00:00:31,288 --> 00:00:33,824
WHAT WILL THE FALLOUT BE AND

20
00:00:33,824 --> 00:00:37,761
EXPLAIN THE DISCONTENT WITH

21
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:41,498
MR. BLANKENSHIP AND THE MAN I'M

22
00:00:41,498 --> 00:00:43,400
ABOUT TO SPEAK TO YOU NOW,

23
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,835
PATRICK MORRISEY, THE ATTORNEY

24
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:45,169
GENERAL.

25
00:00:45,169 --> 00:00:46,337
VERY GOOD TO HAVE YOU.

26
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,938
>> GOOD TO BE BACK ON YOUR

27
00:00:47,938 --> 00:00:48,539
PROGRAM, NEIL.

28
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,106
THANK YOU.

29
00:00:49,106 --> 00:00:51,442
>> Neil: CONGRATULATIONS, SIR.

30
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:53,444
DID YOU EVER GET A

31
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:54,044
CONGRATULATIONS FROM

32
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:54,511
MR. BLANKENSHIP?

33
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:57,982
>> YOU KNOW, WE HAVEN'T, BUT I

34
00:00:57,982 --> 00:01:00,284
WOULD SAY THAT ALL OF THE

35
00:01:00,284 --> 00:01:02,152
CANDIDATES ARE WORKING BEHIND MY

36
00:01:02,152 --> 00:01:02,519
CAMPAIGN.

37
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:06,357
I KNOW CAMPAIGNS CAN BE VERY

38
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:06,657
TOUGH.

39
00:01:06,657 --> 00:01:10,327
DON BLANKENSHIP IS A TOUGH

40
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:10,728
COMPETITOR.

41
00:01:10,728 --> 00:01:12,296
THEY'RE ALL TOUGH COMPETITORS.

42
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:13,998
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE

43
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:15,699
SUPPORT OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT

44
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:18,202
RAN IN THE PRIMARY AND I'M

45
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:20,037
HOPEFUL IT'S A MATTER OF TIME

46
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:21,739
THAT THE REPUBLICANS WILL UNITE

47
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:24,041
AGAINST SENATOR JOE MANCHIN.

48
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,243
THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE

49
00:01:26,243 --> 00:01:27,778
BETWEEN MY PROVEN CONSERVATIVE

50
00:01:27,778 --> 00:01:29,780
RECORD VERSUS JOE MANCHIN.

51
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,981
PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT JOE

52
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:32,316
MANCHIN SUPPORTED HILLARY

53
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:34,518
CLINTON, BARACK OBAMA, SIGNED

54
00:01:34,518 --> 00:01:36,587
CAP AND TRADE LEGISLATION,

55
00:01:36,587 --> 00:01:39,156
KILLING COAL JOBS.

56
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:42,559
SPONSORED A MASSIVE GUN CONTROL

57
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:44,061
BILL.

58
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:44,762
WEST VIRGINIANS WILL HAVE A

59
00:01:44,762 --> 00:01:46,263
CHOICE BETWEEN A CONSERVATIVE

60
00:01:46,263 --> 00:01:47,631
FIGHTER THAT GETS THINGS DONE

61
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:49,233
AND A LIBERAL THAT HASN'T

62
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:50,301
DELIVERED MUCH OF ANYTHING AT

63
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:51,302
ALL FOR WEST VIRGINIA.

64
00:01:51,302 --> 00:01:53,504
>> Neil: YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED

65
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:55,239
TO LEARN THAT SENATOR MANCHIN

66
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,641
VIEWS THINGS SLIGHTLY

67
00:01:57,641 --> 00:01:58,042
DIFFERENTLY.

68
00:01:58,042 --> 00:01:59,443
HE SAID THAT HE WAS REALLY THE

69
00:01:59,443 --> 00:02:01,278
ONLY TRUE CONSERVATIVE AMONG THE

70
00:02:01,278 --> 00:02:03,580
THREE OF YOU, TALKING ABOUT

71
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,982
CONGRESSMAN EVAN JENKINS THAT

72
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:06,617
YOU DEFEATED AS WELL FOR THE

73
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:08,919
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION AND SEEMED

74
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,255
TO BE OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITY

75
00:02:11,255 --> 00:02:13,023
THAT BLANKENSHIP COULD ENDORSE

76
00:02:13,023 --> 00:02:13,290
HIM.

77
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,958
I TAKE IT FROM WHAT YOU'RE

78
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,460
SAYING, YOU HAVE NOT HAD A

79
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,861
CONVERSATION POST THE ELECTION

80
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:18,395
WITH HIM?

81
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:20,230
>> NO, I HAVEN'T.

82
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,299
I THINK PEOPLE THOUGH, THE

83
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:25,402
PRIMARY IS OVER AND RIGHT NOW

84
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:27,004
MYSELF AND SENATOR MANCHIN.

85
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:29,039
YOU'RE LIKELY TO SEE THIS KIND

86
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,641
OF STUFF FROM MANCHIN FOR A

87
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:30,941
WHILE.

88
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,209
HE'S GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO TRY

89
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,645
TO RUN AWAY FROM HIS LIBERAL

90
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:37,781
RECORD AND TRY TO PRETEND TO BE

91
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:38,482
CONSERVATIVE OR HAVE WEST

92
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:40,217
VIRGINIA VALUES.

93
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:41,952
THE REALITY IS THAT THE RECORD

94
00:02:41,952 --> 00:02:44,421
ON THE ISSUES FOR JOE MANCHIN IS

95
00:02:44,421 --> 00:02:46,924
GOING TO PROVIDE A VERY STEEP

96
00:02:46,924 --> 00:02:47,958
HILL FOR HIM.

97
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,893
>> Neil: YOU SAY LIBERAL.

98
00:02:49,893 --> 00:02:52,563
IN YOUR STATE, SIR, YOU CAN BE A

99
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:54,331
MODERATE AND BE DEEMED A LIBERAL

100
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:56,600
RECORD AND DONALD TRUMP IS VERY

101
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,601
POPULAR IN YOUR STATE.

102
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:59,303
WON THE STATE BY 42 POINTS.

103
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:01,505
SO YOU'RE WELL-POSITIONED IN

104
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:02,406
THAT BACKDROP.

105
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:03,974
BUT I WANTED TO GET YOUR

106
00:03:03,974 --> 00:03:05,909
THOUGHTS ON WHAT SENATOR MANCHIN

107
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:07,978
WAS TELLING ME, HIS WILLINGNESS

108
00:03:07,978 --> 00:03:11,081
TO LOOK AT A FACE TWO OF A TAX

109
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,983
CUT REPUBLICANS WANT TO HAVE.

110
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:14,218
MIGHT NOT HAPPEN IN THE SENATE,

111
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:15,819
BUT CERTAINLY GOING TO HAPPEN IN

112
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:16,320
THE HOUSE.

113
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,888
I ASKED THE SENATOR ABOUT THAT.

114
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,523
HE SAID HE WOULD VOTE FOR THAT

115
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:21,291
IF IT CAME UP.

116
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,127
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

117
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:25,362
>> I THINK IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE

118
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:26,463
THAT JOE MANCHIN SAYS ONE THING

119
00:03:26,463 --> 00:03:28,198
AND DOES ANOTHER.

120
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:30,934
HE INDICATED THAT HE WAS OPEN TO

121
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:33,404
VOTE FOR THE TRUMP TAX CUTS BUT

122
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:34,972
HE VOTED KNOW WHEN THE PRESIDENT

123
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:35,906
REACHED OUT TO HIM.

124
00:03:35,906 --> 00:03:38,275
JOE SEEMS TO SAY NO.

125
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:39,510
I THINK VICE PRESIDENT PENCE HAS

126
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,244
POINTED THAT OUT.

127
00:03:40,244 --> 00:03:42,413
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO BE A

128
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:43,714
VERY BIG ASSET IN WEST VIRGINIA

129
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:46,316
BECAUSE HE KNOWS I'M GOING TO BE

130
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:48,552
A STRONG VOTE FOR HIS AGENDA AND

131
00:03:48,552 --> 00:03:51,321
FOR CONSERVATIVE WEST VIRGINIA

132
00:03:51,321 --> 00:03:51,822
VALUES.

133
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:53,524
SENATOR MANCHIN --

134
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,858
>> Neil: HAS HE CAMPAIGNED --

135
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:55,559
I'M SORRY.

136
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,060
DO YOU WANT HIM TO CAMPAIGN FOR

137
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,762
YOU AND HE'S A INGREDIENT TO

138
00:03:58,762 --> 00:03:59,263
OR --

139
00:03:59,263 --> 00:04:02,032
>> I WANT HIM TO COME.

140
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:03,801
I HAD A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION

141
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:05,202
WITH DONALD TRUMP JR.

142
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:06,770
HE'S GOING TO BE COMING IN.

143
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,205
I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT THE

144
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:10,107
PRESIDENT WILL COME BACK TIME

145
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:11,842
AND TIME AGAIN BECAUSE I THINK

146
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:14,378
THE PRESIDENT IS REALLY HAD WEST

147
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:14,878
VIRGINIA'S BACK.

148
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,016
SO I'M VERY HOPEFUL FOR THAT.

149
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:20,517
I THINK HE CAN MAKE A BIG

150
00:04:20,517 --> 00:04:20,918
DIFFERENCE.

151
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,521
HE HAS MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN

152
00:04:24,521 --> 00:00:00,000
WEST VIRGINIA ALREADY.
