1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,069
Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, has made
some powerful opponents.

2
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,080
He doesn’t know me, never met me, he doesn’t
know what I’m all about.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,260
I think they’re very rude statements and
frankly tell him I will remember those statements.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,550
My message to Donald Trump and his team is
that your views of Islam are ignorant.

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,590
He’s the first Muslim mayor of a major Western
capital - and proud of it.

6
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:35,620
This is how Sadiq Khan went from the son of
Pakistani immigrants, to a lawyer, law-maker

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,300
and now the Mayor of London.

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:47,960
Khan’s parents emigrated from Pakistan - his
father was a bus-driver, his mother a stay-at-home

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,350
seamstress.

10
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,079
The 10-strong Khan family squeezed into a
three-bedroom flat in South London.

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:00,660
He wanted to be a dentist but TV in the 1980s
convinced him otherwise.

12
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,140
"Objection!"

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,030
L.A. Law, with its swagger and ill fitting
suits caught Khan’s eye.

14
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:12,320
He graduated in 1991 with a degree in law
from North london University and joined a

15
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,060
human rights firm.

16
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,990
Khan worked a number of high profile cases
- often clashing with London’s Metropolitan

17
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,570
Police force.

18
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,000
But he had bigger political ambitions.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,780
“This is what being a new MP is like, squatting
on a bench in the absence of an office, dealing

20
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,850
with letters from constituents”

21
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,040
"Reports are coming in of an explosion in London"

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,300
"There were explosions and then it was just smoke everywhere."

23
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,020
"Everyone's asking what's just happened"

24
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,810
Only two months after Khan entered the Commons
as a member of Parliament London was attacked

25
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,310
by Islamist extremists.

26
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,060
"That day will stay with me for the rest of
my life”

27
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,680
He spoke out against the attacks both as a
London MP and as a muslim.

28
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,180
He has been very clear about his opposition
to violence, opposition to terrorism and has

29
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,420
set out to make the case for a more open and
peaceful Islam.

30
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,770
That’s Thomas Penny, one of Bloomberg’s
Westminster correspondents.

31
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:22,540
Here is a man who is a muslim and is standing
up and being open and straightforward and

32
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,810
being clear that the problem here is not Islam
but Islamic extremism.

33
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:33,180
In 2015, a decade after that attack, Khan
ran for Mayor of London and his faith was

34
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,489
back in the headlines

35
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,560
His opponent, Zac Goldsmith trying to link
Khan to radical Islam.

36
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,050
“The debate got again personal and nasty”

37
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,400
The Goldsmith camp has called Khan extreme
and accused him of associating with quote

38
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,940
“those who seek to do our police and capital
harm”

39
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,560
Even the fomer Prime Minister, David Cameron,
repeated the allegations.

40
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:06,920
"He shared a platform with Sajil Shahid, the
man who trained the ringleader of the 7/7

41
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,099
attacks."

42
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,610
But the smears didn’t stick.

43
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:19,310
Zac Goldsmith ran a very negative campaign
that was based on what people knew was a lie.

44
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,099
This election was not without controversy.

45
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:35,980
And I am so proud that today London has chosen
hope over fear and unity over division

46
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,610
After taking the mayor's office with a comfortable
majority - Khan has brought a business like

47
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:46,069
efficiency to the role, scrapping expensive
vanity projects like the Garden Bridge and

48
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:51,709
the new Routemaster buses - which cost £350,000
each.

49
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:56,980
The former lawyer, who used to fight the police
in court, is now praised for his close relationship

50
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,980
with them.

51
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:03,310
I was talking to a very senior police officer
in the Metropolitan Police who said there

52
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,930
was a sea change after he went into City Hall...and
the police were saying how much they welcomed

53
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:13,000
this because they knew where they stood and
he was more straightforward to work with,

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,168
he works like a lawyer, he works like a government
minister.

55
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:21,418
Khan’s kept his faith at the fore - He is
an outspoken voice for moderate muslims across

56
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:22,979
the world.

57
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:28,909
"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and
complete shutdown on Muslims entering the

58
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:30,089
United States."

59
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:35,410
Now by giving the impression that Islam and
the West are incompatible you’re playing

60
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,869
into the hands of the extremists.

61
00:04:37,869 --> 00:04:43,529
The ongoing spat between Khan and U.S. President
Donald Trump escalated when Trump went after

62
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:51,979
Khan, misquoting him on Twitter just hours
after the terrorist attack on June 3, 2017

63
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:55,550
Khan is now one of the most prominent Labour
politicians in the U.K.

64
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,490
In fact in a recent poll of Londoners found
him was more trusted to keep the country safe

65
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,830
from terrorism than the Prime Minister or
Labour leader.

66
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,211
His story of going from the son of an immigrant
bus driver to the mayor of one of the world's

67
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:11,879
greatest cities, plays well with Londoners.

68
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,550
But can he appeal to the rest of the nation?

69
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,259
Has Khan got his eye on the top job?

70
00:05:17,259 --> 00:00:00,000
And is the U.K. ready for a Muslim Prime Minister?
