let me just mention briefly one thread in particular that should concern all Americans Democrats Republicans and independents alike especially those who serve in our Congress the epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year it's now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences this isn't about politics or partisanship lives are at risk lives of ordinary people just trying to go about their days to do their jobs contribute to their communities it's a danger that must be addressed and addressed quickly bipartisan legislation is making its way through Congress to boost the government's response to foreign propaganda and Silicon Valley is starting to grapple with the challenge and threat of fake news it's imperative that leaders in both the private sector and the public sector step up to protect our democracy and innocent lives
