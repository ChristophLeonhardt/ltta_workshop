What if plants could count?
The Venus flytrap can —
in a way.
It’s carnivorous and
it waits for an insect
to fall in its trap and
trip its trigger hairs.
Each time a hair is disturbed,
an electrical signal
travels along cell surfaces.
Scientists wired a
flytrap with electrodes
so they could see this
process in action.
Each flick produced
an electric signal
called an action potential.
It took two flicks within
a space of 20 seconds
to make the trap
snap shut.
And more than three flicks
to start up
the cells that
make the digestive enzymes
in dissolving the prey.
And the more times a
frenetic, struggling victim
trips a trigger hair,
the more such juices flow.
Now that’s a smart plant.
