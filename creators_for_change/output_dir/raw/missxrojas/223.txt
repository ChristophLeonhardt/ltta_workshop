survey at gmail com I went to start with

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,850
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> took me a little bit by</font>

15
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,140
surprise when I was watching lots of

16
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,820
your video responses there was a sense

17
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,289
in a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these videos that it was</font>

18
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:29,880
women making it harder for women online

19
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,740
as good as Josette whether it's

20
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,360
harassment or cyber bullying or

21
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,770
something else and Leslie found her

22
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,239
grail hits that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else</font>

23
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,770
aspect of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it when she says if it's</font>

24
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,930
another woman telling me that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

25
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">woman is just mmm blaming hobgoblins</font>

26
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:45,719
pointed out that the fact that there is

27
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,610
so much misogyny and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

28
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,530
misogynistic comments from men out there

29
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,059
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurtful when there are women</font>

30
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,559
who leave those sorts of comments that's

31
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,600
when it digs deepest I feel like my way

32
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,160
into this whole discussion of the reason

33
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,570
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this survey in the first</font>

34
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,980
place was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I experienced a lot</font>

35
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,750
harassment from men generally I've had a

36
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,309
really positive experience with women

37
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,140
online a huge thing this was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

38
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,909
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that almost everyone in videos</font>

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've seen or even just the ones I'm</font>

40
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,880
going to mention today touched on its

41
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,320
feeling that the content wasn't being

42
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,939
taken seriously or like it was being

43
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,439
dismissed one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons why this</font>

44
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,970
might be the case was because it's

45
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,830
Gracie suggestive not being seen as

46
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,960
small or as funny as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the male</font>

47
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,670
counterpart Colin Manning said that in

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">general it's very hard for women to be</font>

49

<font color="#E5E5E5">seven ties all this back to women being</font>

52
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,250
more sexualized than men and tying back

53
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,750
to the first thing I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Abbas</font>

54
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,159
also says that girls get a lot of

55
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,810
criticism on their appearance<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a lot</font>

56
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,340
of that negativity comes from other

saying that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not so much about what</font>

59
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were actually saying it's more about</font>

60
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,400
our parents in the way we present

61

ourselves that's what we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> judged on</font>

62
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,970
that's what is commented on a lot you

63

seem to feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're hitting some</font>

sort of ceiling Hannah Witton says it's

65
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,320
harder for women to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> our videos heart</font>

66
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,090
and to be taken seriously<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all the</font>

67

responses I've seen that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a single</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that men and women have different</font>

struggles when it comes to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

73
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,710
you talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a discussion where all</font>

74
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,719
the men agreed that if they tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

75
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,070
hard in a video they would get the same

76
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,600
kinds of comments they did on the other

77
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">videos and that would be really</font>

78
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,209
frustrating for them because these were

79
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:11,250
videos they had put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of work into</font>

80
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,460
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea that I was going</font>

to be as she said universally loved and

shared no matter what the content of

that video like that was their

fundamental point of concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> sarah says</font>

85
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,290
on the other hand what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear from</font>

86
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,970

87
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,350
taken seriously because they have to

88
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,790
worry in a very real way about

89
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,800
themselves being hated before their

90
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,290
content is even seen or absorbed the

91
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,910
woman is so much likely to be judged<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

92
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,620
her appearance and also the fact that

93
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,780
she's a woman speaking her mind is this

94
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,220
unique to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet framing</font>

95
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,020
hobgoblins doesn't think so we forget

96
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the Internet she says is just the</font>

99
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,290
and everything still has that sense that

100

the merit of a woman is linked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> her</font>

become less of a harmful place maybe

167
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,340
because I've been surrounding myself by

wonderful men and women ok let's look

169

about community episode 7 says that not

only is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it great because female content</font>

creators are coming together and these

formalized networks also awesome for

put themselves out of a job that they

there should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be a reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,540
have no function she says that although

192
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,190
she thinks networks are great the ideal

193
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">situation would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the network</font>

194
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,220
didn't need to exist at all when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says</font>

have beneficial for those who are inside

or like allied with the cause and this

198
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,150
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the cause of women on the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">internet just being cooled together but</font>

200
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,480
they can be imposing for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the course and only the brave</font>

202
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,810
says the former communities are really

203
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,000
important but they can sometimes make

204
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,950
people feel like they're shut out and

205
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,510
westerns generally in favor of them but

206
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,320
which is that there were more

207
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,450
intersectionality within them I agree

208
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,560
with Gracie that I think they're a great

209
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,240
way to get feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your work and I</font>

210
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,250
think that's a big part of taking

211
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,750
yourself seriously I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

212
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">always feeling like your stuff is worthy</font>

213
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,110
of receiving feedback agree with Maria

214
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,970
see the telling and encouraging women to

215
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,860
create is a beneficial thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lynard</font>

216
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,180
right and he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just one of the many</font>

217
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,250
men who also participated in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lady</font>

218
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,080
stuff in did such a great job says that

219
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,780
he thinks that

220
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,100
sorts of communities are beneficial when

221
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,260
the focus is<font color="#CCCCCC"> on women online and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

222
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,000
content and their talent however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

223
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">really impressed by rincey reads video</font>

224
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,370
and I think she made a very good point

225
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,950
when she said that communities are great

226
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,000
and they're particularly useful for

227
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,860
discovery of new content but a lot of

228
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">people can see these channels and see</font>

229
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">these networks and feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like they're the</font>

230
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,470
only way to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> female they have a</font>

231
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific brand and there are people who</font>

232
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,740
don't necessarily feel like they<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit in</font>

233
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,120
with that so the thing we all kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

234
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,710
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make clear among ourselves is</font>

235
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that those aren't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the only options that</font>

236
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,710
are other options on there the great

237
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,090
thing about the Internet is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

238
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,130
just make stuff the response that I've

239
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,900
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken with me and I hope you guys</font>

240
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,669
find it useful as well if you haven't

241
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:57,410
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> Malcolm as this video was this</font>

242
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,480
having a network of women<font color="#E5E5E5"> around you who</font>

243
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,250
are receptive to what you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

244
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,900
it's like having a night light in your

245
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,400
bedroom when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the dark</font>

246
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,260
it makes you brave and decay there was

247
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,790
so many recommendations i'm going to

248
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,380
race through them quite a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you and</font>

249
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,430
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that's clearly going</font>

250
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come up in other recap videos as well</font>

251
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,700
recommended orange<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the new black</font>

252
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,050
claiming home<font color="#CCCCCC"> covered in says</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she likes</font>

spectrum of perfection Lena<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Hannah</font>

255
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,060
Witton said that they liked how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

256
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,800
woman by Caitlin Moran and Lena said

257
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,090
that she thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to just</font>

258
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,130
chat more about feminism<font color="#E5E5E5"> I completely</font>

259
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,630
agree that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just chat more</font>

260
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,820
about this stuff in a kind of casual way

261
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,680
without making assumptions about each

262
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,720
other more often than not nowadays we

263
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">have like the lowest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> assumptions of</font>

264
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,020
people we go in with the assumption<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

265
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,110
they are expert vehicle that they just

266
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,360
hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> you or they hate everyone or that</font>

267
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,340
they're stupid and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just an</font>

268
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,660
attitude that I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a lot on</font>

269
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,890
the internet and I find it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

270
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,390
disheartening because this is a great

271
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,479
platform to have these discussions in

272
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:52,850
grown-up way and in a casual back and

273
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,220
forth way and I understand reaching

274
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,560
these levels of frustration but I also

275
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,820
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can have a more effective</font>

276
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,130
conversation when we don't make those

277
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,510
assumptions and that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

278
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,570
learnt as well I think I've turned it

279
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,539
down a little bit it was quite highly

280
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:10,789
strung with rage previously and that's

281
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:13,400
fine feel what you're feeling but it's

282
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,200
not fair to jump to those conclusions

283
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,660
about someone else cara cara since she's

284
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,010
been reading those<font color="#CCCCCC"> articles about Taylor</font>

285
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,180
Swift which I think was a really

286
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,860
interesting cultural study last year you

287
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,450
guys recommended words of TED<font color="#CCCCCC"> talks as</font>

288
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,919
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was one that Emily recommended</font>

289

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> hidden meaning in kids movies and</font>

290
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,100
that goes back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what she was saying</font>

and she mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> the book 50 shades of</font>

298

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dismiss and it made me really</font>
