I wish all Muslim people across our country Ramadan Mubarak Ramadan is a time for Muslims around the world to renew their faith and strengthen their resolve to do better for themselves and their communities it is a time to reflect on the valuable contributions is LOM has made to this country and the wonderful community spirit enjoyed in Britain's many diverse towns and cities it is a time for celebration but it is also a time for reflection this Ramadan may we reflect on the horror of rising Islamophobia throughout this nation and the brutal attacks against innocent mosques and Islamic centres we must remember that we are always stronger when we work together I know many mosques will again be opening their doors to look after homeless and hungry people as they do every year Ramadan is a time for family and friends and the whole community to be together and where mosques open their doors to all of course fasting is what comes to mind when we think of Ramadan but fasting is just one example of devotion to faith and our communities Ramadan is much more than that it's about being more charitable and reflective and saying prayers for those with less fortunate lives than us we all have something to learn from Ramadan every single one of us can learn from this holy time in the Muslim calendar I hope everyone will come together with members of the Muslim community at this special time of year to join in the festivities Ramadan Mubarak and peace be upon you all if this truly is a time for peace and reflection then I look forward to Muslim leaders across the UK and the rest of the world reflecting upon and condemning the brutality occurring along security fences in the Gaza Strip I also look forward to the universal condemnation from Muslim leaders and organizations of the ongoing brutality and attacks against Israel in the West and the terrorist training facilities being operated and used by Hamas this Ramadan I look forward to Muslim politicians like Sadiq Khan and Baroness Warsi condemning the authoritarian policies enforced honors by the state which imprisoned decent people who are willing to stand up to blasphemy laws and speak the truth about an ideology that hates us and this Ramadan I looked forward to one whole month free of Islamic terror attacks if you like that and want to see more remember to Like and subscribe or download the rebel at from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store you
