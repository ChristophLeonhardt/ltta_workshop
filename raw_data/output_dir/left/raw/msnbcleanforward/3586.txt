00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">Guiliani from tonight on Fox News</font>

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about why the president really</font>

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,000
fired<font color="#E5E5E5"> James Comey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that'll be</font>

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,370
followed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by what the president told</font>

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,559
Lester Holt about why he fired James

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,369
Comey he fired call me because Comey

8
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:19,980
would not<font color="#E5E5E5"> among other things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say that he</font>

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,050
wasn't they targeted the investigation

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's entitled to that Hillary Clinton</font>

11
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,769
got that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she he couldn't get that so</font>

12
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,929
he fired him<font color="#CCCCCC"> then he said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

13
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,649
this guy and he went on Lester<font color="#E5E5E5"> Holt</font>

14
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:35,880
Lester Holt interview was as good as

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,489
anybody could do better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than I think any</font>

16
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,260
of the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mulla could have done and Lester Holt</font>

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,070
asked him why<font color="#CCCCCC"> did you do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he said I</font>

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,829
did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I felt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I had to</font>

20
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">explain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the American people their</font>

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,460
president was not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> target of the</font>

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,010
investigation<font color="#CCCCCC"> regardless of</font>

23
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,020
recommendation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going to fire call</font>

24
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,199
me knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was no good time to do</font>

25
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and in fact when I decided to just do</font>

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">it I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said to myself I said you know this</font>

27
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">rushar thing with Trump</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and Russia is a</font>

28
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,070
made-up story<font color="#CCCCCC"> so maybe there you have it</font>

29
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,890
the Giuliani argument was interesting we

30
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,509
were unable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look up and see when</font>

31
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,460
Hillary<font color="#E5E5E5"> Clinton had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> president but</font>

32
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,560
our researchers are still<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">that what do you what do you make of</font>

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">that well again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it's first of all</font>

35
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,409
everyone here loses credibility both

36
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,390
Trump<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Giuliani because they can't</font>

37
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,579
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep their their story internally</font>

38
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:31,829
consistent<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've said this</font>

39
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about Trump he can't keep his</font>

40
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:34,740
story straight it's hard to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

41
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">story</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> straight when you're not telling</font>

42
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:36,810
the truth

43
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,460
so that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their stories now</font>

44
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,860
are inherently<font color="#E5E5E5"> contradictory doesn't</font>

45
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,840
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look very credible but second</font>

46
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know what Giuliani said is</font>

47
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,130
essentially some of the evidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

48
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,170
Muller would be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which is he</font>

49
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,500
that that that Trump fired<font color="#CCCCCC"> Co</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me because</font>

50
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">Comey wouldn't clear his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that goes</font>

51
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">right to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of intent with</font>

52
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">respect to obstruction</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know I</font>

53
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,040
think Trump's<font color="#E5E5E5"> own statement to Lester</font>

54
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,340
Holt

55
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,430
also was damaging because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said you</font>

56
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,869
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of that Russia thing it</font>

57
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,669
showed it was on his<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind but Giuliani's</font>

58
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,348
was even more<font color="#CCCCCC"> focused than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

59
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,720
because he wouldn't clear me that that

60
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">to me rings even more of obstruction hey</font>
