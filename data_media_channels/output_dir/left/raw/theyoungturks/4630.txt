1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:03,450
SO, A MOTHER OF A BOY WITH A
RARE GENETIC DISORDER TWEETED

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,240
OUT HER HOSPITAL BILL.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,900
ALLISON'S SON ETHAN WAS BORN
WITH A RARE SYNDROME,

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,220
WHICH IS A RARE GENETIC DISORDER
IN WHICH ORGANS FORM ON THE

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,270
WRONG SIDE OF THE BODY.

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,090
SHE TWEETED OUT HER HOSPITAL
BILL, SAYING THAT IT SEEMS

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,770
FITTING THAT WITH THE TRUMP
DEBATE RAGING I GOT THIS BILL

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,300
FROM ETHAN'S MOST OPEN ñ MOST
RECENT OPEN-HEART SURGERY.

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,160
YOU WILL SEE THAT SHE IS ONLY
GOING TO BE PAYING $500, BUT

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,700
DON'T WORRY, SHE WON'T MAKE US
DO ANY MATH, SHE TWEETED THAT

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:50,910
WITHOUT INSURANCE SHE WOULD GO
$231,000 ABOUT.

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,110
SHE HAS COMMENTED EVEN MORE ON
TOP OF THIS.

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,660
SHE SAID, I DID NOT FOLLOW
POLITICS BEFORE NOVEMBER, I

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,450
WAS OVERSEAS FOR BOTH OF
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S ELECTIONS.

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,640
I HAVE BEEN SURPRISED AT HOW
LOUD EACH SIDE YELLS, IT

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,890
PAINTS THESE ISSUES AS IF THEY
ARE BLACK AND WHITE WHEN

17
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,159
THEY ARE ANYTHING BUT THAT.

18
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,640
IT REDUCES OUR KIDS TO A LINE IN
A BUDGET, NOBODY REALIZES

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,030
THERE ARE REAL PEOPLE BEHIND IT.

20
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,180
I KIND OF DISAGREE WITH ONE
POINT HERE, WHERE SHE SAYS,

21
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,880
I HAVE BEEN SHOCKED BY HOW
LOUDLY, IT PAINTS THESE

22
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,360
ISSUES AS BLACK AND WHITE WHEN
THEY ARE ANYTHING BUT THAT.

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,250
I THINK THAT HEALTHCARE IS A
BLACK-AND-WHITE ISSUE FOR

24
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,070
ME, I THINK IT SHOULD BE
AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE.

25
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,610
AM I WRONG IN THINKING THAT?

26
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,340
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING, BECAUSE
YESTERDAY I WAS LISTENING TO

27
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,630
PATRIOT RADIO, WHICH IS ñ I KNOW
WE ARE ON PROGRESS RIGHT NOW,

28
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,799
AND I GUESS PATRIOT IS THE
CONSERVATIVE COUNTERPART TO THIS

29
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,680
RADIO STATION, AND THERE WAS A
DOCTOR WHO CALLED IN, AND HER

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,670
THOUGHTS ON HEALTHCARE ARE SO
DIFFERENT FROM THE THOUGHTS THAT

31
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,270
WE DISCOVER ON ñ THAT WE DISCUSS
ON THE SHOW.

32
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,520
SHE THINGS HEALTHCARE
SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR

33
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,200
CATASTROPHIC ISSUES, NOT FOR
PREVENTATIVE, HEALTHCARE,

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,489
ADDICTION, IT SHOULD BE USED FOR
ANYTHING, UNLESS YOU HAVE

35
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:12,791
SOMETHING CATASTROPHIC HAPPENED
TO YOU.

36
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,590
SO IF YOU HAVE CANCER, THAT'S
WHEN IT WOULD COVER CERTAIN

37
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,670
THINGS.

38
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,169
THE REASON I BRING THAT UP IS
BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE THINGS

39
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:20,810
LIKE YOU, GRACE NOT EVERYONE
THINGS LIKE US.

40
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,169
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY
WHO WORK IN THE HEALTHCARE

41
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:26,829
PROFESSION WHO THINK THAT HEALTH
INSURANCE SHOULD ONLY KICK

42
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:30,049
IN WHEN IT COMES TO SERIOUS
TERMINAL ILLNESSES, WHICH

43
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,049
IS ABSURD.

44
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:36,040
THE WAY TO AVOID THESE TERMINAL
ILLNESSES OFTEN TIMES IS

45
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,980
PREVENTATIVE CARE.

46
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,280
ONE THING I'VE BEEN VERY
FASCINATED BY IS CUBA, NOT

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,349
ONLY FOR THEIR MEN, BUT BECAUSE
OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

48
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:47,019
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

49
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:48,159
ANA HUMANIZES US.

50
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,359
I KNOW, I KNOW.

51
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:55,510
AND IT'S IS INTERESTING BECAUSE,
BACK WHEN CUBA HAD RESOURCES

52
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,510
FROM THE SOVIETS, THEY ACTUALLY
HAD INSANELY GOOD HEALTHCARE.

53
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,879
NOW, OF COURSE THEY LOST A LOT
OF RESOURCES BECAUSE OF THE

54
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,310
FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION, BUT
THEY STILL HAVE THE BEST

55
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,680
PREVENTATIVE HEALTHCARE.

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,249
PREVENTATIVE HEALTHCARE IS SO
IMPORTANT.

57
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:19,749
THIS IDEA OF LIKE, WHO CARES
ABOUT PREVENTATIVE HEALTHCARE?

58
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:21,330
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO WORK THAT
WAY.

59
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,069
THE REASON WHY PEOPLE IN CUBA,
WHO BY THE WAY, MANY OF WHICH

60
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:30,239
LIVE IN POVERTY, THE REASON WHY
THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY IS SIMILAR

61
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,659
TO OURS, EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE
THE SAME RESOURCES AS US, IS

62
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,859
BECAUSE THEY FOCUS ON
PREVENTATIVE CARE, IT IS SO

63
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:38,110
IMPORTANT TO THEM.

64
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,109
SO, YOU KNOW, I LOVE THIS STORY,
NOT BECAUSE OF THE TRAGIC

65
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:45,749
CONDITION THAT HER SON HAS TO
GO THROUGH, BUT BECAUSE IT

66
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:47,279
PROVIDES SOME PERSPECTIVE.

67
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:49,749
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS NOT
PERFECT.

68
00:03:49,749 --> 00:03:52,250
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
ABSOLUTELY DOES DESERVE TO BE

69
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,000
CHRIS EYES, BECAUSE FOR SOME
PEOPLE IT HAS NOT WORKED OUT AND

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,319
IT HAS BECOME MORE COSTLY;
HOWEVER, THERE ARE A LOT OF

71
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,650
PEOPLE THAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE
ACT HELPED OUT.

72
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,249
THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF
THAT.

73
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:14,510
HE HELPED MY MOM WHO HAD A
CHRONIC DISEASE, A

74
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,599
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION.

75
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,488
ANYWAY, YOU GUYS JUMP IN.

76
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:23,310
WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT HEALTH
INSURANCE, THIS IS A REALLY BIG

77
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,759
TOPIC, WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT
HEALTH INSURANCE IS, THESE

78
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,740
INSURANCE COMPANIES, AT THEIR
BEST, REALLY DO THAT YOU WANT

79
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,919
YOUR HOOK FOR A HUGE MEDICAL
BILL, AS WE HAVE JUST DETAILED.

80
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:38,240
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THESE
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

81
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,580
BEGINNING TO BACK OFF ON A LOT
OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DO

82
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,580
COVER.

83
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,870
AND SO, THIS IS PART OF, JUST
A SEGUE INTO A GENERAL

84
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,759
DISCUSSION INTO WHAT'S
HAPPENING.

85
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,849
INSURANCE IS SOMETHING THAT WE
REALLY HAVE TO HAVE, BECAUSE

86
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:54,000
THERE ARE SO MANY HEALTH ISSUES
AND MEDICAL ISSUES THAT CONFRONT

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,689
US AND OUR FAMILIES, BUT THOSE
THINGS THAT ARE COVERED, THE WAY

88
00:04:57,689 --> 00:04:59,800
THAT THEY ARE COVERED, THE WAY
THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES PUSH

89
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,300
BACK ON COVERAGE, IT'S A REAL
PROBLEM, AND IT'S GOING TO BE AN

90
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,719
EMERGING ISSUE IN THIS COUNTRY
IN A VERY VERY SHORT TIME.

91
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:09,840
I MEAN, EVEN A BIGGER ISSUE THAN
IT ALREADY IS.

92
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,310
THE NUMBER OF MEDICAL
BANKRUPTCIES HAVE GONE UP I

93
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,860
THINK SOMETHING LIKE 61% SINCE
THE 1980S.

94
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,280
YOU HAVE TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY,
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN

95
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,539
DEAL WITH THE MEDICAL BILLS.

96
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:27,550
SO, FACING CATASTROPHIC MEDICAL
BILLS, WELL, THAT WOULD EASILY

97
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,610
BANKRUPT ANYONE.

98
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,470
I MEAN, MOST REASONABLE
MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE.

99
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,670
SO, ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,
THIS HEALTH CARE DEBATE,

100
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,879
AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY
DEBATE, IT'S PART OF A BIG

101
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:42,190
DEBATE, AND BIG PROBLEMS THAT
THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO HAVE

102
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,100
TO FACE, AND WE ARE BACKSLIDING
ON THEM I THINK, EVERY DAY.

103
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,539
ABSOLUTELY, IT'S A BIPARTISAN
ISSUE AND EVERYONE NEEDS TO

104
00:05:48,539 --> 00:00:00,000
GET INVOLVED.
