President Trump goes to the UN and snacks Rocketman plus was president Trump indeed wiretap because there's new news suggesting his campaign manager certainly was and will talk about Obamacare repeal which is back on the table I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so now I have rocket man stuck in my head as does everyone in the United States because President Trump decided to drop that reference during his UN speech today we will play it for you President Trump went to the UN he gave what I thought was the best speech of his relatively young presidency that was quite a good speech we'll go through what was in it and what it shows about American foreign policy because it does sort of lend credence to the idea that all this talk about realism versus neo-cons that a lot of these gaps are a little bit exaggerated but I'll explain what I mean by all of that because now I've got rocky min stuck ok we'll get to all of that but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over a bowl and branch so as I say one of the things I love best in life is that you don't actually the United States it's great you don't actually have to be wealthy in order to live like a wealthy person well one of the things that makes you feel wealthy is climbing into a set of sheets at night that is just a top quality and you can do that with bull and branch there are three ex presidents who sleep on these sheets Plus me so lots of great people sleep on these sheets and these are there's a reason for it they are 100% organic cotton they're breathable they're super comfortable much more comfortable than whatever you are sleeping on right now I know because I got rid of all these sheets we home I've bought several pairs of bowl and bran sheets after being spoiled by sleeping on them right now they sell online exclusively obviously and that means that they sell for half the price and twice the quality and if you try them for 30 nights and you don't like it you can return them for a full refund so it really is a no risk proposition go to bull and branch calm today it's bol el and branch calm today you get $50 off your first set of sheets plus free shipping when you use promo

slept in more comfortable sheets when I go to hotels the sheets at the hotels are not nearly as comfortable as the sheets that you get from bull and branch calm use that promo code Ben okay so president Trump was at the UN this morning and he gave what was by virtually all accounts a very good speech a lot of people on the left are very upset because he was too mean to Iran in North Korea he was too militant how dare he be mean to these countries dianne feinstein sent out a the senator from California she sends out a note saying that it was just terrible how could President Trump do such a thing he complained that he greatly escalated the danger we face from both Iran and North Korea she said the goals of the United Nations are to foster peace and promote global cooperation today the president used it as a stage to threaten war he missed an opportunity to present any positive action the UN could take with respect to North Korea and he launched a diatribe against Iran again offering no pathway forward okay a couple of things about this number one the Trump administration was responsible for a unanimous resolution in the UN Security Council levying more sanctions on North Korea so Trump has done more with the UN and North Korea and then Obama ever did and with regard to Iran it is the Iran deal that has allowed the Iranians to gain power in the region it's the Iran deal where President Obama sent literally pallets of cash like tens of millions of dollars pallets of cash to the Iranian regime which were then funneled towards terrorism and gave them a pathway a legal pathway to a nuclear weapon in ten years or less and in ten Feinstein is ripping Trump over all of this which is by suggesting he would revisit and possibly cancel the Iran nuclear agreement he greatly escalated the danger we face from both Iran and North Korea no actually it's the Iran nuclear agreement that essentially has made it clear to North Korea that they should continue to pursue a nuclear weapon because once you get close enough to a nuclear weapon then no one will attack you ever ever ever again right what nation would negotiate with the United States when the agreements we reached with other countries are so easily undermined we reached a negotiation with the North Koreans or in the Clinton administration Dianne Feinstein should know she was still senator of California at the time and it didn't make any difference they developed a nuclear weapon anyway so that the Democrats are fighting mad and they've been forced into the awkward position of now having to defend some of the worst people on planet earth so presidents from at the UN today gave what was a very interventionist speech I mean people are perpetrating this as a realist speech but this is not really a realist speech okay what he was talking about today he said things like we don't want to intervene and change other people's systems for them that's not our goal but then he talked about Venezuela and he suggested properly that they need to return to some sort of democratic rule in Venezuela well if you're a hardcore realist like a Rand Paul realist and a non interventionist you'd say what does Venezuela with us okay so they're pressing their own people okay so that people are starving unmask what does that have to do with us the reality is the vast majority of Americans as realist as we consider ourselves still have a moral spine to what we believe about foreign policy and that doesn't mean we can afford to be the world's policeman or that we should intervene everywhere it does mean when we see egregious abuses like play like in Venezuela that the u.s. does consider action because the American people generally demand such action we generally do now a big problem is the American people don't then have patience for such action very often but the fact that we actually care about Venezuela demonstrates that this is not a hardcore realist America first administration you can be America first and still pursue America's goals because one of our goals is the fomenting of democracy and and the liberalism like old-school classical liberalism around the world again that doesn't mean military overthrow sometimes that means sanctions sometimes that means diplomacy but the idea that Trump is a non interventionist I think that didn't survive this speech today so president Trump starts off by ripping into Venezuela and talking about socialism and has been in Venezuela is pretty spectacular clip 14 the problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented but that socialism has been faithfully implemented okay and you hear total silence in the room and finally there's a little bit of a plot I like Trump to staring out at that all the socialist countries who have been imbibing this nonsense for a while and what he says here is exactly right this is what I have said for a long time it's not about socialism being a great idea miss applied it's about a bad idea being applied properly every place that socialism is tried to its full capacity it leads to massive amounts of human suffering death and starvation so good for Trump on this Trump also suggested that the world has a moral responsibility to decide against aggressors here as president Trump talking about Iran and saying that the that we have to confront evil or evil will triumph if the righteous many do not confront the wicked few then evil will triumph when decent people and nations become by Stan history the forces of destruction only gather power and strength no one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the well-being of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea good for him okay what he's talking about here is exactly correct this is a far cry from President Obama who went in front of the United Nations virtually every year and then whined about how the United States was responsible for all the world's ills he would go up there and he would talk about how America in the past had been too braggadocious how we in the past we've been too interventionist it's been our fault we've made people angry we've been too arrogant none of that from President Trump good for President Trump I mean all this is good that the fact is that we're gonna need to see some actual hard policy backing the words you know how far is he willing to go what is he willing to do that's always the question right it's always the sean connery question from The Untouchables what are you willing to do that's always the big question in foreign policy and we don't really have a clear answer from President Trump on that but I know one thing he's not willing to do and that has apologized for the USS presence on the world stage and that's a very good thing that's very and it's reassuring because the truth is that in the past president Trump has made sort of Ron Paul Ian's comments about about the role of the United States in the world you remember just a few months ago he was talking about how the US has killed people like Vladimir Putin and one of the criticisms that I think is actually not unfair of this speech is that Trump nowhere in the speech mentioned Russia and Russia's aggression continues and I think that's perfectly appropriate to point out the president from should have mentioned Russia that's one critique the other critique of his speech is this line that he dropped halfway through that is that is totally trumpian where he's talking about North Korea and he just decides to drop in Elton John song in the middle of his speech about North Korea here's what he had to say Rocketman is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime Rocketman like he's just reading straight from this Twitter feed now I think it's gonna be a long long time so touchdown brings me round again man apparently the North Korean delegation walked out apparently they were not here for this they said they let a junior diplomat sit-in they packed their bags last night pre-flight zero hour 9:00 a.m. so that's yeah I don't understand the purpose of the rocket man thing is like it's funny it's funny but it's it also undercuts the seriousness of the situation I mean imagine I said there's a great tweet today about this I do love that there's a there's somebody who tweeted out about you know Ronald Reagan suggesting that room 3 Ronald Reagan should have gone to Brandenburg Gate and said well well birthmark hair tear down this wall might not have had quite the same in fact if he had said that to Mikhail Gorbachev so I'm not sure what the purposes of this it is funny it is funny the media are jumping on it and they are suggesting that this demonstrates that he's not serious suggesting that he is obviously stupid and that's why he did all of this he's Trump and that's why he did all of this but you know how serious he is about North Korea what we're gonna find out what wouldn't find out I don't think North Korea is gonna stop this sort of activity I really don't it is amazing to watch however the media go completely nuts over the speech as though he said something wildly different now here's the thing that's funny the left is going crazy over the speech because they're suggesting that President Obama never would have been so confrontational he never would have done anything like this President Obama launched a virtually useless and counterproductive war in Libya President Obama signed off on the Iran deal President Obama did nothing about North Korea and he used to go there and talk consistently about human rights President Trump doesn't like talking about human rights very much when he goes to the UN what he is saying is more conducive to human rights than what President Obama said in niceness on the world stage does not equal the the promulgation of human rights it doesn't equal the spread of human rights Americans strength on the world stage equals the spread of human rights around the world doesn't mean we're always right doesn't mean everything we do is good doesn't mean every choice we make is the right one but it does mean that a stronger America is a freer world and a weaker America is he is a less free world and even President Trump who sort of began this campaign is an anti interventionist the Iraq war was evil and conspiratorial all of this he's moved beyond that now as all presidents do okay there's a there's a general foreign policy consensus no matter how much we wish to bucket Obama was the first one really to try to bucket that says that America needs to be strong on the world stage because otherwise the world becomes a worse place I think Trump understands that and good for him okay before I go further there's some big news about Trump and Paul Manafort and was Trump right when he tweeted that he was wiretapped first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at legacy box so when was the last time you watched those old home movies you know the ones that are stuck in

big news last night is that there were two stories that broke about President Trump and the Russia investigation okay so they're the first big story came courtesy of CNN so CNN reported Monday evening that investigators quote wiretap former Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort under secret orders before and after the election furthermore according to CNN manna for was tapped when he was having conversations with Trump or may have been and Manta Ford had a residence at Trump Tower so it's actually unclear if the FBI tapped him at that location now you'll recall that back in January President Trump tweeted about how the FBI under Obama had wiretap him at Trump Tower or E they tapped his wires at Trump Tower so there's a lot of talk about how that was a lie it wasn't true that he wasn't specifically tapped that his phone wasn't tapped for example so there are three things that we're talking about here one is Trump's wires works specific wires tapped and the answer seems to be no the second is mana force wires yes they were tapped and third is were they tapped at Trump Tower so were there wires tapped at Trump Tower we don't know the answer to that there's a fourth question to which is was Trump on the other end of those calls hey even if Trump was on the other end of those calls that doesn't mean that he was deliberately surveilled it means the metaphor was surveilled mana for it's been a very dirty player for a very long time people have known about this for a few years now that he was basically in bed with the Putin regime CNN reports the conversations between mana 4 and Trump continued after the president took office long after the FBI investigation into mana 4 was publicly known sources told CNN they went on into lawyers for the President and mana fort insisted they stop according to the sources it's unclear whether Trump himself was picked up on the surveillance so mana 4 was campaign chair for Trump for about five months he was not surveilled during that period after he was a Austin from from March to August after he was ousted the FBI surveillance began again so it's very possible the FBI did not tap Trump's wires but they may pick Trump up well tapping mana force where so there are a couple of questions here - one is was the fire FISA warrant justified was this attempt to get Trump and get his campaign now the case against that is that mana fort was being tapped before he was on the Trump campaign and that while he was on the Trump campaign they ceased the tap basically and then they started it up once he was off the Trump campaign again so that cuts against the idea that Obama was deliberately targeting Trump with these wiretaps in favor of the idea is again mana fort was the campaign manager and these taps continued for a long time and we still don't know what exactly they were tapping or how they obtained the FISA warrant in order to believe that this was wrong you have to believe that the FISA Court was basically corrupt that they granted the warrant in order to go after Manta fort in order to get Trump these were a bunch of Obama appointees doing his bidding in order to sing Trump if that were the case then you would imagine that President Obama would have had a lot at stake in leaking out information about mana forts wires being tapped during the election cycle right I mean that would have been the time to do it that's not exactly what happened so I'm a little skeptical of the claims that this is you know an Obama setup that he was setting up mana fort in order to get Trump I'm not skeptical at all of some of the unmasking accusations the idea that Susan Rice was deliberately unmasking Trump with the hope that that would leak into the press that I think is quite possible but I do by the entirely the argument that Trump was being wiretapped by evil Obama forces man afford again is a dirty player it's very likely he's gonna end up prosecuted and that's the story from the New York Times today the New York Times is reporting that special investigator Robert Muller's team has told manna Ford he will likely face charges according to the hill quote the warning allegedly a shock-and-awe tactic came as federal agents combed through his computer files documents and any other potential pieces of evidence that could help them in their federal investigation the New York Times reported on Monday citing two people close to the investigation now one of the things that's interesting about this is that why would you tell Manta Fort you're going to indict him unless you're threatening him with indictment to get him to flip this is the most dangerous path for Trump the most dangerous path for Trump is not that he was tapped not that he said anything agreed just to mana fort but that mana fort thinks he knows something and is going to bargain his way out of trouble by flipping on Trump this is one of the reasons why there was a lot of suspicion when Muller started getting involved with the idea with the New York Attorney General State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman Schneiderman considers himself part of the anti Trump resistance he is a far leftist he has always been a far leftist and Schneiderman if he is used as a proxy for Muller in order to bring state charges against Nana fort Trump does not have the power under the Constitution to pardon Manta Ford for a state crime and that's a serious problem for Trump because you could see Snyderman bringing charges against mana for mana for flipping against Trump and all that information getting to Muller and then you actually have a real problem on your hands so this looks like there could be in order for Muller to to retain his patina of objectivity he's gonna need to ask Schneiderman to step aside if you really believe state crimes have been had been committed here Sneiderman cannot be the face of the people going after mana for it's just it's too political it's a disaster if you think that Jeff Sessions was right to recuse himself I think he probably was then you also have to believe that Schneiderman should recuse himself in this invest investigate into mana for because he's just too politically driven he's just too politically driven okay all of the the reason that I go into all of this is because it's so easy to look and see these bizarre sort of parallel universes that the right and the left live in so left is looking at the story and they're saying AHA mana fort was tapped because mana Ford is guilty and that means Trump is guilty no evidence that Trump is guilty no buttons the Trump was even caught on the tapes no buttons many of that I've said for well over a year at this point that mana fort was a bad pick by Trump I've said for months that if anyone was gonna get indicted from the Trump campaign it was going to be mana fort not Trump again mana fort could have been working with the Russians and not told Trump that's quite plausible mana forts worked the Russians for years and why would he tell Trump Trump's a big mouth Trump would go blow that thing wide open so it's quite possible that mana fort is guilty and Trump isn't and for the people on the right who are saying this justifies Trump's tweets about wiretapping okay first of all and I really don't I'm not sure that it does I don't think that it does but beyond that I think that it is I think it is important to recognize but that's not a good story for you if you're a trump supporter if your defense is Trump was right about the tapping he was so right that they were tapping his line because they suspected mana Ford of a crime and so Trump's probably involved in a crime I'm not sure that's a good line of defense for you you can celebrate him being right about the tweet and then get him deep more deeply involved in the mana fort investigation that doesn't seem brilliant that doesn't seem great I don't see the the upside there for president Trump so that's the story with all this again I think that well it's being blown up into a headline on CNN I don't think this is actually huge news and while it's being blown up by people on the right to say Trump was right all along this whole shtick of Trump was right all along about a tweet that doesn't matter seems to me counterproductive because the only thing that matters here is whether there's going to be any underlying crime that's found not what their Trump was right about the tweet unless again you believe that that Obama was deliberately targeting members of the Trump team in order to bring him down and I do have some questions about that believe me I'm more than happy to talk about President Trump misusing the levers of government I wrote an entire book about it it's called the people vs. Barack Obama in which I suggested that the Obama administration engaged in criminal activity in things like the IRS scandal but I want to see the evidence that President Obama did something wildly improper in targeting Paul Manafort or the FISA Court did something wildly improper in issuing the FISA warrant before I jump down Obama's throat and suggest that this was all targeted attempt to get Trump I'm not sure that I see that here okay so before I go any further and explain the latest news on Obamacare repeal I and the democrats completely falling apart by the way I mean I need to show you some footage of Nancy Pelosi being yelled at by her own side which is just incredible before I do any of that first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at stamps.com okay so you're sick of waiting in line at the post office I

about a week and a half to pass Obamacare appeal if they do not pass Obamacare appeal in a week and a half they're not getting it done this year if they don't get it done this year it's very likely that it's very unlikely they're gonna get it done next year the reason being once we hit a midterm election year everyone is really antsy no one wants to be seen as voting for something super controversial so the latest version of Obamacare quasi repeal it's not full repeal because the only way to do full repeal presumably would be to would would be to get 60 votes in the Senate or two in order to get the Senate parliamentarian to rule that a majority can overthrow regulations right now that so here's how it works in the Senate there's a weird rule called reconciliation in the Senate reconciliation means that the Senate can vote with 51 votes they don't need 60 votes they need 51 votes he can't filibuster it to alter American law in a way that is budget neutral that does not increase the budget and that affects standing versions of American law so that means that getting rid of regulations it's kind of difficult to determine how that's going to impact the budget and so getting rid of regulations purely the general rule according to the Senate parliamentarian is the dad doesn't fall under reconciliation he need 60 votes this is why Obama needed 60 votes for Obamacare because he was creating new law it wasn't just getting rid of old law he was creating new law okay so here's the new version that's being rolled out it's being rolled out by senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy it is a much better version of what we saw before it is a better version of what we saw before so here we're gonna go through it briefly here so you know what it is yeah I've been talking with several senators and it seems like there's some good momentum behind this particular bill it's not a full repeal of Obamacare it doesn't get rid of all of Obamacare taxes it doesn't get rid of all of Obama cares regulations at the federal level it doesn't get rid of the regulations it does allow state waivers and those state waivers could theoretically create the the incentive for states to move toward loosening regulations but it does not get rid of the Obamacare regulations at the federal level its advocates say it's Federalists that it evolves power to the states people like Rand Paul say it doesn't do enough so here's what's in it first of all Medicaid gets slashed so one of the big problems with Obamacare is that it has this open-ended commitment to increase Medicaid exposure by the federal government we're gonna pay for your Medicaid expansion basically ad infinitum on an as-needed basis well this bill the Cassidy Graham bill it slashes Medicaid growth pretty dramatically instead of the federal government sending money to States on a need basis states are instead given block grants which means that we just send them a set amount of money it's not based on need and all the money in these block grants instead of going to the states that have already expanded their Medicaid rolls as Obamacare did right that was the incentive Obama said you want you want this money you need to increase your your Obamacare exchange you need to create an Obamacare exchange then we'll send you money this new bill gets rid of that provision it basically says they we're going to allocate to all the states evenly rather than two states that expanded their Obama their Obamacare or subsidized Medicaid rolls so that means that states like Texas would benefit like California would lose the goal would be it would be to cut expected Medicaid funding on the federal level by one-third by 2026 and eliminated it entirely by 2027 now the problem with this of course is that really kicks the can down the road if you think Congress is going to eliminate the subsidies you have another thing coming Congress has never heavily limited medical subsidies okay as I say Medicaid is redistributed the states hearted hit the hardest hit are the ones that have already expanded their Medicaid rolls based on Obamacare is false and and lying expansion of regulations around the actual law it doesn't get rid of the individual mandate so you no longer have to buy health insurance this does drive up prices right remember the individual mandate is a funding mechanism for redistributed of health care the Obamacare mandate forces me as a healthy person to pay for my health care so that an old sick person can pay less for theirs that's what Obamacare individual mandate does so how do they fill in that gap for the insurance companies well what they do is they allow states to waive essential benefits okay so this sort of halfway brings back the the state the the ability for insurance companies to sell plans that do not include pre-existing conditions so that's how the that's how they are going to bring down the cost is by allowing more competition in the marketplace by allowing them to sell different types of different types of insurance so relieve some of the regulations now getting rid of the pre-existing conditions plans brings down the overall cost of health insurance but for a select few people who are already sick and don't get insurance through their employer those people are going to see increased healthcare cost they will they'll see you increased healthcare costs and there there's an increase in subsidies to try and make up for that the question is whether that is enough so this is a better bill than the one that Republicans rejected a couple of months back it still won't do enough to open up competition because it leaves a lot of these key regulations in place until all pre-existing conditions on regulations are removed you're gonna see prices increase because competition won't be free and open it doesn't get rid of all of Obamacare taxes either but it is a step in the right direction I think there's a good shot that it passes and it should it should pass this is a bill that I think is actually worth voting for as long as we don't say that this is all right this is not the end of the story this is the first step toward Obamacare repeal this is not the entirety of Obamacare repeal and so it's D important that we make that distinction because we don't want to lie to constituents who expect that this is gonna fix everything okay meanwhile while Republicans are struggling over the Russia investigation and Obamacare appeal there is there's something else happening among the Democrats and that is a full-scale disaster so Democrats you know there's this idea that when you're in the opposition that you're unified and you're cohesive and you have the ability to push things and president Trump lately has been giving up the Democrats pretty easily well the Democrats have some problems of their own this was demonstrated last night when a bunch of illegal immigrant protesters descended on a Nancy Pelosi press conference here's what it looked like do you have the Nancy Pelosi clip that would be let's see immigrant protesters force number two why don't we do this since since you don't want to listen since you don't want to listen we'll have to just go how radical are the Democrats how radical is their base Nancy Pelosi is too far right for them they're protesting daca because they say it doesn't do enough they want to get they were protesting because they want ice to be completely disbanded they want a completely open border this is the Democrat base or at least part of the Democrat base and they don't know what to do about it they don't know what to do about it it's completely and utterly bereft of reason it's totally amazing and the Democrats are moving further and further to the left in order to take advantage of these people but in doing so they're leaving the middle like senator Kirsten Gillibrand she's considered a 2020 contender and she came out and she said that who are the leaders of our party Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren my god I think you have your congressional leaders of course but I think you know senator Sanders is out there talking about things that has big ideas like Medicare for all I think Elizabeth Warren's out there talking about a rigged system that we desperately need to fix for working family okay amazing that this is their new party their new party is is Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders good luck with that gang I mean they're so radical but luis Gutierrez the representative he was ripping on John Kelly oh boy who is Trump's chief of staff he said that John Kelly was basically a traitor to the United States despite his military service and said that he had he had basically sold out Americans and all this and Gutierrez refuses to apologize because that's how polarized you have to be to demonstrate to your base that you're crazy enough to represent them do you regret speaking that strongly and criticizing John Kelly let me just say this I could have been more careful well with the use of my words and there are times that you need to reevaluate having said that I saw him as head of Homeland Security deport grandmother's who had been for 15 years reporting dutifully to Homeland Security with their American citizen grandchildren heartless actions and increasing deportation against people who know who presented no threat he says no apology to Senator to general Kelly for basically calling him a sellout to the United States of America that is the new Democratic Party they've got some serious problems and meanwhile they saw of Hillary trolling around for for book money trying to claim that she's gonna challenge the legitimacy of the election I'm old enough to remember when it was crazy when president from San that he might challenge the legitimacy of the election in fact I criticized him for it here was president Trump then candidate Trump saying that he might challenge the legitimacy of the election way back when in October a victim of one of the great political smear campaigns in the history of our country they are coming after me to try and destroy what is considered by even them the greatest movement in the history of our country there's never been anything ok so then there there was Trump back in October and the media went nuts over this he was asked about it in debates Hillary said it was despicable for anybody to challenge the results of an election here is Hillary Clinton yesterday talking about challenging the legitimacy of the election eight months after it took place would you completely rule out questioning the legitimacy of this election if we learn that the Russian interference in the election is even deeper than we know now no I would not I would say you're not gonna rule it no I wouldn't rule it out but I also what are the means like totally unprecedented in every way it is what would be the means to challenge it if you thought it should be a challenge basically I don't believe there are there are scholars academics who have arguments that it would be but I don't I don't think they're on strong ground I mean amazing so this is the new democratic party Hillary Clinton whining about her life and Bernie Sanders and Kristin Gillibrand illegal immigrants shouting at Nancy Pelosi for not being crazy enough so while we talk about the Republican Party having some problems the Democrats are far worse off than the Republicans right now okay so before I get to things I like and things I hate I first want to say thank you to our sponsors over $1 shave club so everyone
