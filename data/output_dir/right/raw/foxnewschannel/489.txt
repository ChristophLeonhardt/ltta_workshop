1
00:00:01,943 --> 00:00:03,211
THANK YOU.

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,647
GOOD TRANSITION THERE.

3
00:00:05,647 --> 00:00:06,447
JESSE.

4
00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:07,782
POLITICS IS A GAME THAT TURNS

5
00:00:07,782 --> 00:00:11,019
PLAYERS INTO MONSTERS AND

6
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:14,589
MONSTERS INTO PLAYERS.

7
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:15,723
WHEN DIANE FEINSTEIN GOT DR.

8
00:00:15,723 --> 00:00:17,725
FORD'S ALLEGATION SHE WAS A

9
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:18,092
PLAYER.

10
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:19,561
RATHER THAN HOLD A PRIVATE

11
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:23,431
MEETING TO PROTECT THE FAMILIES

12
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:26,801
AND LIVES OF KAVANAUGH AND FORD

13
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:29,304
FEINSTEIN SAT ON IT UNTIL IT

14
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:31,372
COULD ONLY BECOME A SHOW TRIAL.

15
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:35,910
IT NORMALIZED COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

16
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,245
YOU DROP A BOMB AND INNOCENT

17
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,780
PEOPLE DIE.

18
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,584
THE MOB IN THAT ROOM KNEW THEIR

19
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:46,654
BOMB WOULD DESTROY REPUTATIONS

20
00:00:46,654 --> 00:00:48,456
AND SCAR TWO KIDS.

21
00:00:48,456 --> 00:00:49,557
THEY DID THE MATH.

22
00:00:49,557 --> 00:00:53,261
THEY RELEASED THE PUBLIC

23
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,965
ACCUSATIONS LEAKING TWO

24
00:00:56,965 --> 00:00:57,532
ACCOMPLICES.

25
00:00:57,532 --> 00:00:58,967
IN THE END THE FORD LETTER WENT

26
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:01,203
FROM FEINSTEIN TO THE MEDIA.

27
00:01:01,203 --> 00:01:04,138
FEINSTEIN DOESN'T KNOW HOW THIS

28
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:04,638
HAPPENED.

29
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:05,640
HOW COULD IT?

30
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,009
>> YOU TELL US YOUR STAFF DID

31
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:10,011
NOT LEAK IT?

32
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:10,712
>> I DON'T BELIEVE MY STAFF

33
00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:11,613
WOULD LEAK IT.

34
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:15,617
I HAVE NOT ASKED THAT QUESTION

35
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:15,984
DIRECTLY.

36
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:16,551
>> DO YOU KNOW THAT?

37
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:17,919
HOW IN THE WORLD DID THAT GET IN

38
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:19,221
THE HAND OF THE PRESS?

39
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:20,989
>> THE ANSWER IS NO.

40
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:22,991
THE STAFF --

41
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:26,695
>> HAVE YOU ASKED YOUR STAFF?

42
00:01:26,695 --> 00:01:30,765
>> I JUST DID.

43
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:36,071
PARDON ME?

44
00:01:36,071 --> 00:01:37,506
>> WELL, SOMEBODY LEAKED IT.

45
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:38,940
IF IT WASN'T YOU.

46
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,110
>> IT WAS NOT -- I DID NOT.

47
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,413
>> OH, THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

48
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:45,480
CALL IS A MYSTERY.

49
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,883
FOR SURE IT WAS A MIRACLE ONE

50
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:51,286
THAT CREATED A HELL NO ONE WOULD

51
00:01:51,286 --> 00:01:52,688
WANT TO ENDURE.

52
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:54,290
HAPPILY FOR FEINSTEIN AND

53
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,992
FRIENDS THE TARGET STILL ENTERED

54
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,861
THE COLISEUM.

55
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:03,098
THIS IS BIGGER THAN HE SAID, SHE

56
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:03,399
SAID.

57
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:04,667
THIS WE SAID.

58
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,069
DUE PROCESS REPLACED BY

59
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:07,503
VIGILANTES.

60
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:12,808
YESTERDAY WE SAW A MOB SPEAKING

61
00:02:12,808 --> 00:02:13,142
PAYBACK.

62
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:15,544
A FEMALE VICTIM GETS USED.

63
00:02:15,544 --> 00:02:19,148
A WIFE, MOTHER AND DAUGHTER ARE

64
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:19,581
WOUNDED.

65
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:21,317
AMERICA GETS SICK WHILE

66
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:23,619
FEINSTEIN HOLDS A PITCH FORK AND

67
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:24,586
SAYS WHO ME?

68
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:27,523
>> GOOD, GOOD.

69
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:30,993
>> THIS WAS SO MANUFACTURED.

70
00:02:30,993 --> 00:02:36,031
WHERE MILLANO WAS SITTING OVER

71
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,700
KAVANAUGH'S SHOULDER.

72
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,967
SHE WAS THE GUEST OF FEINSTEIN

73
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:41,203
AND SMILING AND TEXTING.

74
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:45,641
IT WAS LIKE WHY WAS SHE THERE.

75
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:48,610
THAT WAS ORCHESTRATED.

76
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,679
THIS WAS A SHOW TRIAL.

77
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:52,448
>> THAT HAD THE INTENDED EFFECT.

78
00:02:52,448 --> 00:02:55,617
LOOK WHERE WE ARE TODAY.

79
00:02:55,617 --> 00:02:56,719
WHEN KAVANAUGH CAME BACK,

80
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,021
SOMEONE TALKED TO HIM AT LUNCH

81
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:00,856
TIME AND SAID LISTEN, DUDE, YOU

82
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:02,291
WANT THIS JOB, YOU GET OUT AND

83
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,394
FIGHT FOR THIS JOB.

84
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,830
HE WENT BACK OUT THERE AND SWUNG

85
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,398
AND DID IT.

86
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:10,499
HE THE MOMENTUM.

87
00:03:10,499 --> 00:03:12,935
GOT BACK ON TOP.

88
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:16,072
CRUISING TOWARDS THE NOMINATION

89
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:19,875
AND THEN JEFF FLAKE HAPPENED.

90
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,344
>> YES.

91
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:25,581
>> ANYONE AS A FORMER ACTIVIST

92
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,250
AND ATTORNEY MYSELF, IF YOU

93
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,253
THINK THOSE NOISY DEMONSTRATORS

94
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:32,288
HAVE NO IMPACT, TALK TO THE TWO

95
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:33,656
LADIES WHO CONFRONTED JEFF FLAKE

96
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:38,127
IN THAT ELEVATOR.

97
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:39,795
THEY MADE HISTORY.

98
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:41,797
HE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE

99
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:43,232
STRONGEST ROD IN THE SHED

100
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,566
ANYWAY.

101
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:44,500
HE COLLAPSED.

102
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,535
>> [LAUGHING].

103
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:48,905
>> THEY HAD NO CHOICE.

104
00:03:48,905 --> 00:03:54,177
LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID IT DIDN'T

105
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:56,345
COME FROM FLAKE.

106
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:59,682
IT CAME FROM FEINSTEIN.

107
00:03:59,682 --> 00:04:06,723
>> THIS LETTER WENT TO THE

108
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:08,691
CONGRESSWOMAN, THE DEMOCRATS AND

109
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:09,058
FEINSTEIN.

110
00:04:09,058 --> 00:04:12,528
THE ONLY THREE PEOPLE WHO HAD

111
00:04:12,528 --> 00:04:12,862
CUSTODY.

112
00:04:12,862 --> 00:04:15,231
FORD WAS COMPELLING AND

113
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:15,632
BELIEVABLE.

114
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:17,100
BUT SHE IS NAIVE.

115
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,636
AN ACADEMIC.

116
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:22,038
SHE SEEMED OUT OF IT AT TIMES.

117
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:24,607
SHE'S BEEN MANIPULATED BY THE

118
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:26,042
SEASON DEMOCRATS AND THE

119
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:28,177
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND BY HER

120
00:04:28,177 --> 00:04:28,578
LAWYERS.

121
00:04:28,578 --> 00:04:29,879
THE PROSECUTOR DID AN EXCELLENT

122
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,116
JOB EXPLAINING THAT.

123
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:34,117
HERE'S HOW:

124
00:04:34,117 --> 00:04:35,718
THE WHOLE AFRAID OF FLYING.

125
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:36,386
THAT WAS MANUFACTURED.

126
00:04:36,386 --> 00:04:37,787
SHE GOES TO HAWAII AND ACROSS

127
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:38,254
THE COUNTRY.

128
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:40,690
SHE HAD JUST FLOWN BACK AND

129
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,092
FORTH ACROSS THE EAST COAST AND

130
00:04:43,092 --> 00:04:44,360
WEST COAST.

131
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,030
THAT WAS A LIE.

132
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,232
SHE NEVER HEARD THE INVITATION

133
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:50,500
TO INTERVIEW HER.

134
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,504
HER LAWYERS KEPT THAT FROM HER.

135
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:58,141
>> SHOULDN'T THE LAWYERS BE IN

136
00:04:58,141 --> 00:04:58,474
TROUBLE?

137
00:04:58,474 --> 00:05:00,743
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOUR

138
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:02,011
CLIENT EVERYTHING.

139
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:06,249
SHE HAD NO IDEA THAT OFFER WAS

140
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:06,883
PROFFERED.

141
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:08,118
THE POLYGRAPH WAS BIZARRE.

142
00:05:08,118 --> 00:05:10,820
THEY DID ON THE SAME DAY SHE

143
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,058
WENT TO HER MOTHER'S FUNERAL.

144
00:05:15,058 --> 00:05:16,793
THEY DIDN'T RELEASE THE AUDIO

145
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:21,531
AND VIDEO FROM THE POLYGRAPH.

146
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:24,067
THE SEXUAL ASSAULT PROSECUTOR

147
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:25,602
SAID THIS IS NOT HOW YOU TREAT A

148
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:27,871
TRUE VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

149
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:31,174
YOU DON'T POLYGRAH HER UP AND

150
00:05:31,174 --> 00:05:34,578
PARADE HER OUT ON NATIONAL

151
00:05:34,578 --> 00:05:34,978
TELEVISION.

152
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:37,881
THESE PEOPLE LIKE WATCHING FORD

153
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:39,115
BEING TORTURED AND KAVANAUGH

154
00:05:39,115 --> 00:05:41,151
BEING TORTURED.

155
00:05:41,151 --> 00:05:42,819
IT WAS SADISTIC.

156
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:46,156
>> AND IT WAS ALSO PREMEDITATED.

157
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:48,525
THE DEMOCRATS I COME BACK TO

158
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:49,526
THIS POINT.

159
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:51,094
THE DEMOCRATS REPRESENT THE

160
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:52,362
PRO-CHOICE FORCES IN IN COUNTRY.

161
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:54,364
THEY HELD THE WEAK HAND.

162
00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:58,335
THE PRO-LIFE FORCES OF THE

163
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:01,972
REPUBLICANS HOLDING THE STRONGER

164
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:02,272
HAND.

165
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:04,341
THE DEMOCRATS GET THE GOLDEN

166
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:06,576
TICKET IN THE FORM OF DR. FORD

167
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:06,977
ACCUSATIONS.

168
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:09,145
HOW WILL WE USE THIS?

169
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:12,282
WE WILL HOLD IT AND LOOK LIKE WE

170
00:06:12,282 --> 00:06:14,117
ARE LOSING.

171
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:15,519
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

172
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,387
>> WHEN THIS FIRST CAME UP, NO,

173
00:06:17,387 --> 00:06:21,758
WE ARE HOLDING A VOTE ON MONDAY

174
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:22,726
AND NOT PLAYING GAMES.

175
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:24,361
IF HE HAD DONE THAT, IT WOULD

176
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:26,763
HAVE AVOIDED THIS DELAY.

177
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:29,399
IT WOULD NOT HAVE JEOPARDIZED

178
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,835
THIS VOTE.

179
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:32,469
>> [OVERLAPPING TALKING].

180
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:35,305
>> DO YOU THINK HE WOULD HAVE

181
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:35,672
SUFFERED?

182
00:06:35,672 --> 00:06:37,007
>> HE WOULD HAVE SUFFERED.

183
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:38,709
>> REPUBLICANS IT LOOKS LIKE

184
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:40,978
THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO HEAR

185
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:43,180
FROM WOMEN ABOUT SECRETARY OF

186
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,480
STATE.

187
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,115
THE PLAYBOOK THE DEMOCRATS HAVE

188
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:47,785
BEEN USING FOR DECADES.

189
00:06:47,785 --> 00:06:50,254
IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A GOOD

190
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:50,554
LOOK.

191
00:06:50,554 --> 00:06:53,090
THE CONSEQUENCES ARE HERE WE ARE

192
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,390
TODAY.

193
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,192
>> ONE THING ABOUT DIANE

194
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:55,993
FEINSTEIN DROPPING THIS BOMB IN

195
00:06:55,993 --> 00:06:57,628
THE MIDDLE OF THE COMMITTEE, HER

196
00:06:57,628 --> 00:07:00,164
STAFF AND SENATOR GRASSLEY'S

197
00:07:00,164 --> 00:07:02,499
STAFF, THEY USED TO HAVE A GOOD

198
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:02,933
RELATIONSHIP.

199
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:06,370
THEY HAD A PROFILE WORKING

200
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:06,804
RELATIONSHIP.

201
00:07:06,804 --> 00:07:08,305
>> NOT ON ABORTION.

202
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:10,307
>> LIKE PROTESTING WHISTLE

203
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:11,275
BLOWERS AND OVERSIGHT OF

204
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:12,743
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

205
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:14,411
SHE HAS DESTROYEDED ANY KIND OF

206
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:16,981
RELATIONSHIP THEY HAD IN THE

207
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:20,684
PAST AS THE LEFT CONTINUES TO

208
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:22,253
LECTURE THE RIGHT ABOUT COMING

209
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:23,354
TOGETHER AND WASHINGTON WORKING

210
00:07:23,354 --> 00:07:24,922
TO BETTER THE COUNTRY.

211
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:26,724
SHE DESTROYED THAT RELATIONSHIP.

212
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:27,625
IT WAS A GOOD ONE.

213
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,761
SHE HAS A LOT OF EXPLAINING TO

214
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:31,896
DO.

215
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:33,164
THERE SHOULD BE AN

216
00:07:33,164 --> 00:07:33,597
INVESTIGATION.

217
00:07:33,597 --> 00:07:34,798
>> SHE IS TROUBLE WITH THE LEFT

218
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:35,366
IN CALIFORNIA?

219
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:35,799
>> MAYBE.

220
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,201
>> THIS IS BIG.

221
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:38,702
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THIS.

222
00:07:38,702 --> 00:07:41,972
I WAS A YOUNG LAWYER WHEN ROE V.

223
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:43,440
WADE WAS ARGUED AND PASSED.

224
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,878
IT WAS A SEA CHANGE.

225
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:51,615
THIS WAS PROFOUND -- THE WOMEN

226
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:52,683
IN THE STREETS.

227
00:07:52,683 --> 00:07:56,086
THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT UNFOLDING.

228
00:07:56,086 --> 00:07:58,088
THIS IS THE GENERATION LATER.

229
00:07:58,088 --> 00:08:00,491
THE PRO-LIFE FORCE HIS AN

230
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:02,860
OPPORTUNITY TO SWAY THINGS BACK

231
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,494
THEIR WAY.

232
00:08:03,494 --> 00:08:04,261
A GENERATION LATER.

233
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:07,731
THIS IS THE FIGHT TO THE FINISH.

234
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:08,999
THIS IS ANY MEANS NECESSARY.

235
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:12,903
>> YOU CAN SAY THIS IS

236
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:13,270
POLITICAL.

237
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:18,275
THIS IS ABOUT ABORTION.

238
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:20,845
YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP CALLING FOR

239
00:08:20,845 --> 00:08:24,682
INVESTIGATIONS OF UNCORROBORATED

240
00:08:24,682 --> 00:08:25,082
CLAIMS.

241
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:26,550
THIS IS POLITICAL AND KAVANAUGH

242
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,353
SAID IT WAS POLITICAL WHICH THEY

243
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:30,521
HATE HIM FOR.

244
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:32,557
>> RIGHT.

245
00:08:32,557 --> 00:08:33,658
>> [OVERLAPPING TALKING].

246
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:40,597
>> [INAUDIBLE].

247
00:08:40,597 --> 00:08:43,333
>> [OVERLAPPING TALKING].

248
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,170
>> THEY PLAYED DIRTY WITH

249
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:46,504
GARLAND.

250
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:47,805
>> NOT LIKE THIS.

251
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:49,574
>> I DON'T THINK YOU COULD

252
00:08:49,574 --> 00:08:51,976
PREDICT OR SAY THAT WITH THIS

253
00:08:51,976 --> 00:08:52,743
SUPREME COURT NOMINATION

254
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:53,978
ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ROE V. WADE.

255
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:57,815
I THINK THAT'S A GAME IN ITSELF.

256
00:08:57,815 --> 00:09:00,118
I DON'T THINK THAT'S UNDER

257
00:09:00,118 --> 00:09:00,451
THREAT.

258
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:00,818
>> I DO.

259
00:09:00,818 --> 00:09:03,354
ROE V. WADE SAID THERE IS A

260
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:04,489
COMPETING INTEREST.

261
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:06,624
MOTHER AND UNBORN CHILD.

262
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:09,060
THE CHILD BECOMES VIABLE.

263
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,463
THE CHILD HAS THE RIGHTS OF A

264
00:09:12,463 --> 00:09:13,164
HUMAN.

265
00:09:13,164 --> 00:09:17,435
THAT DATE KEEPS GETTING PUSHED

266
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:17,735
BACK.

267
00:09:17,735 --> 00:00:00,000
>> [OVERLAPPING TALKING].
