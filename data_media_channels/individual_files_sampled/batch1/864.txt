for generations millions of Indonesians have depended on the chittaram river but today the river is poisoning them textile factories that supply some of the biggest fashion brands are using it to dump toxic chemicals I'm Steve Chow on this episode of 101 East we investigate the human cost of the world's most polluted river on the chittaram River fishermen like Rudy no longer catch fish they catch plastic beginning I can put the ugly one glass because I call glass lamp a Corolla P indonesian rivers dumped two hundred thousand tons of plastic into the sea each year but for the millions that live along the chittaram River there's something worse than plastic toxic chemicals nor has always lived here every morning she goes to the well which is fed by the cheater on what its appearance I want a team I do what Mandy who sees how you run Varna I am Tamara Norris two children are always sick she blames the river 1 gamma cod who seem to the develop asthma ha ha today the children have a doctor's appointment nor takes them twice a month Yuda her eldest son falls ill as soon as he finishes his medicine - angrily - oh very the Tongass a Jew go get - guitar guitar and Mandan every I'm your IRA nari Holly so what could be making them sick Denny RIS Wandy runs the only environmental group in the region for 17 years he has been surveying the chitra in search of evidence of pollution by the textile industry the build team a lot especially on Brad Elkins barometer Prasad Vasa gigantic aluminum Vulcan Barbara brosher a common work and I'm a communicator elephant polo Cobra Harry neeyala from Bergen limber amiga terrible parappa industry the reprehend receive the new media day were manageable read there are pockets that much upon us look at the delicate stir it in here more Hawaiian see partner a Brassica chevy better than shifter to more than about their manufacture improvements get it cooking in a ticket to come back to the apartment you terribly booked into port or three-quarters of what is produced along the river is sent abroad mainly to the US and Europe one of the largest exporters in the country is the giz jackscrew giz tech produces mainly polyester fabric a synthetic material that requires a lot of chemicals in these buildings 1000 machines operate 24 hours a day seven days a week the factory produces nearly three million litres of fabric a month each of these machines processes the fibers with water filled with chemicals 40 liters of water for every t-shirt the wastewater then flows to the settling tanks so this is our wastewater treatment so our wastewater treatment the size is 50 meter width and hundred meter length and then the depth is around 6 meter so what kind of parameters do you analyze the device water not every day only five measurements a day international standards require at least 31 I don't think so but it's not harmful maybe not drinkable yeah still need to be filter if you want to drink but I mean it's okay you can pass but for me visual control is water check I take I put in hand if I don't get itchy then good to find out what the wastewater from this global textile company contains we head to the factories water outlet thirty meters away and the water is covered with a film of white foam this is what kiss tax did not want to show us we take two liters for analysis along the river are rice fields this is Kong Yusuf's lambda I did leave my acharya momusu did my canola be Natalia tammini my dad's calleda be Natalia by that poverty in in or Vanya be servants of a ticket or we call saccharine Linton to parent even Sutton tinta coolly which are Spadina - hmm Wow okay now le widening his crop is surrounded by factories the water that irrigates his rice field is purple and fraud he agrees to let us test his rights we take our samples of rice and water to the Institute of ecology of Paget jaren university professor soon RD runs the only environmental studies laboratory in the region atomic absorption spectrometry this is special for heavy metal measurement this is for mostly chemical ousia chemicals parameters so this is the irrigation water okay yeah this is the rice yeah from the sweater here this is the water from the factory from the waste water I come back anyway yeah I will ready part after okay I continue thank you again again okay see you thank you while we wait for the test results we arrange to meet some of the women and children from the village near the factories we offer to analyze their hair to better understand which pollutants they are exposed to to advise us we put Christ Appenzeller on the line you want fillet for herself he is the person to speak to in Europe when it comes to researching pollutants with hair samples and heads the human bio monitoring unit at the Institute we take hair from ten children aged from 12 months to 14 years we send them straight to Professor Appenzeller in Luxembourg as we are leaving the village we receive a call from environmental activists alerting us to nighttime waste dumping from a factory see okay okay it's part of the pan Asia group one of the largest subcontractors in the Indonesian textile industry hi okay so what is this the the Kenya or bomb scary close to the water it smells so toxic we need mess thank you the you know for sure they don't L c-47 and you don't put off okay this morning and you fold it up good yeah okay thank you okay let's go time I can see thank you so much thank you thank you we send these samples to a laboratory in France that specializes in environmental studies in the meantime dr. Soong Rd has finished his analysis of the wastewater and writes he can't believe what he found he wants to see the rice fields for himself one thing with his strain is the total chram chromium content in the party planes we found that it's very high 28.0 84 milligram per kilogram will be found at a lab concentration on the body plants is much higher than the recommended standard in the limits we found a twenty nine point zero 3 milligram per kilogram while the standard only 0.25 human body especially for children let this very dangerous this lead will disturb the underfur system but central or very pure systems so if the children exposed to the lab then they will have like intellectual disability sometime later this is the worse effect of the net I believe that the main source of pollution is from the textile industries this rice that grows along the Chitra is sold throughout Indonesia he also found the water from the gist ex-factory had lead levels 1.5 times the international limits for industrial wastewater there's more bad news when we receive the results for the pan Asia factory where we took the water samples at night at the home of environmental activist Danny Reece Wandy we contact professor the French chemist who analyzed the wastewater no Jubilees so they said somewhere not this anymore don't don't loose it Dixie foolishly no possibilities on young issue no no leash nope really a lil mo no septic said you know complete resection we want to know what major clothing brands do the polluting factories supply we sift through dozens of clothes their labels show which ones are sourced from Indonesia we find a Baby Gap vest made in Indonesia H&M sweater made in Indonesia adidas made in Indonesia we then get the lists of indonesian subcontractors from these big brands the factories from which we took the waste water appear on the lists including pan Asia the company is registered as one of H & M's subcontractors it also works with other brands like Uniqlo it was in the pan Asia water that we found high levels of nonylphenol a powerful hormone disrupter the gist explant and its waste with high lead levels is also subcontracted by the Uniqlo brand H&M has an office in the Indonesian capital Jakarta I'm the director of hmm Indonesia agrees to see us so we made some water analysis what we found was well yeah it was a little interesting especially that I would like my sustainability team should look at it this mornin technical level that I'm you then I'm usually looking at ok but from a general perspective what I can just share is that H&M has a commitment on on waste water and we know the world is not perfect this is of course not what we would like to see three weeks after this interview H&M writes to us saying we are sincerely concerned by the subject of your report H&M has a size scale and ambition to lead the change towards a truly sustainable fashion industry while acknowledging they face a challenge they claim independent audits of companies like pan Asia show there are no levels that exceeded limits in their wastewater the Japanese brand Uniqlo also responded saying they consulted reports of the pan Asia plant that showed levels below our results but they would investigate further with independent experts 252 clothing brands work with indonesian subcontractors who dumped waste water into the Chitra the big fashion groups here are all gathered in the same Association a PR the textile industry lobby in Indonesia a key sector with a 12 billion dollar turnover eg is me is their representative of our environment like the cleaner production a collab a co-production or the utilization or us so money do you think the water that comes out you have the results here do you think it can be used for drinking for irrigation use we present him our analysis of rice and water which show the presence of industrial pollutants of textile factories including hormonal disruptors and neuro toxic or carcinogenic molecules would you drink this water this is this comes from Penn Asia mm-hmm this is one of your member will you drink this water would you use it for your irrigation if I leave it there I use that even if you saw there all the parents we don't have chosen you said for your country yeah but for the environment when you see that we don't have solution when you talk to the brand name and then cut the order and the factory is closed simple yes dr. Blinn and it's common in close path and then finish what does that make you feel to see that children living around factories sometimes like this if you have so many pollution I think maybe next 50 year we are now what is the x-men you know killer max where we are no mutant how are you Father yes thank you for taking some time at the Ministry of Environment the person in charge of Pollution Control agrees to meet us he reads our analysis and seems surprised I think I will ask the director for Water Pollution Control to take sample and if the sample confirmed this number we will ask the local government or a revised the permit and we also may be revised the deadline for textile industry that would be good news but it may be too late for the residents along the river professor Appenzeller from the Luxembourg Health Institute has the results of the HECO serizawa-kun Department of Energy honest anticipated is it on a district still what agility to deposit toxic lead developing in Toms big loss is computer success impossible a mentally sleek but he gets the combo the labels are the x-men facility downstream Quantico Sierra to meet global demand textile production in Indonesia is expected to increase by 75% by 2030 major clothing brands can no longer look away too many victims are paying a heavy price you
