PRIMARY DEBATE. CONGRESSMAN DESCENT HAS COME A QUESTION FOR YOU. THERE ARE 850,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS LIVING IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. THAT’S MORE THAN 6% OF THE LABOR FORCE HERE. WOULD YOU DEPORT ALL 850,000 OF THOSE PEOPLE? WELL AS GOVERNOR I’M NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT AUTHORITY, BUT HERE’S WHAT I WOULD DO, THERE’S NOT GOING TO BE ANY SANCTUARY CITIES IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. AND IF THERE IS A LOCAL OFFICIAL IN ITS IN A CATEGORY WHERE THE GOVERNOR CAN DO THIS, ANY THAT FROM THEIR POSITION IF I’M ALLOWED TO. SO HERE’S THE THING. IF YOU WANT TO DO ANOTHER AMNESTY WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO DO, HONESTLY, HERE’S THE PROBLEM WITH THE AMNESTY. IT SENDS A SIGNAL TO PEOPLE TO COME ILLEGALLY AND IT’S A SLAP IN THE FACE TO PEOPLE WHO COME LEGALLY. FLORIDA HAS ONE OF THE MOST VIBRANT POPULATIONS OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS, PLAYERS ARE TALKING ABOUT THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR KIDS? THEY ARE CONTRIBUTING TO OUR SOCIETY. I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A LEGAL WORKFORCE. IF YOU HAD A LEGAL WORKFORCE A LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS WOULD NOT BE HERE AT THE FIRST FIVE OR TEN YEARS. PATH TO CITIZENSHIP? I’M SAYING JUST THE OPPOSITE. I OPPOSE THE SHIMMER OBAMA. BUT THAT IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO LET LAWLESSNESS PREVAIL THE SUNSHINE STATE. WE CAN MAKE A DECISION, DO YOU WANT TO SHUT OFF THE MAIN MAGNET, AND IF YOU DO THAT, WE WILL HAVE HUGE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM LEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND PEOPLE WON’T HAVE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE 850,000 HERE ILLEGALLY? IF YOU ARE HERE ILLEGALLY AND IN THE E-VERIFY SYSTEM I DON’T THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE A JOB THAT AN AMERICAN WE WANT TO HAVE. IT HAS DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON WAGES AND IT’S NOT WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP CAMPAIGNED ON AND IT’S NOT SOMETHING I SUPPORTED. I’VE ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF AMNESTY AND SUPPORT ABOUT THINGS LIKE E-VERIFY, BORDER WALL AND ENDING CHAIN MIGRATION AND THE VISA LOTTERY. THAT’S THE DIRECTION WE SHOULD GO FEDERALLY. WE WERE MENTIONED THERE, DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND? THAT IS THE DIRECTION YOU SHOULD GO IN WASHINGTON. THEY HAVEN’T PASSED AN IMMIGRATION BILL. EMPLOYERS IN FLORIDA MUST HAVE A STABLE LEGAL WORKFORCE WITH NO PATH TO CITIZENSHIP BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN IMMIGRATION FIX THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF THIS ECONOMY. GOVERNOR SCOTT DEALT WITH E-VERIFY WITH HIS EXECUTIVE THAT IS THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT GOVERNOR SCOTT HAS PERFORMED HERE IN FLORIDA. THAT’S WHAT FLORIDA FIRST LEADERSHIP LOOKS LIKE. WASHINGTON IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS, WE NEED SOMEONE WHO KNOWS FLORIDA BEST, WILL PUT FLORIDA FIRST, AND KEEP OUR ECONOMY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THE DEMOCRATS, THEY DON’T JUST WANT SANCTUARY CITIES, THEY ARE CALLING FOR FLORIDA TO BE A SANCTUARY STATE. THAT’S THE STATE OF THIS ELECTION. PLACES LIKE MARYLAND AND PLACES IN CALIFORNIA EVEN ALLOW PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE ILLEGALLY TO VOTE. NOT ON OUR WATCH, NOT IN THE SUNSHINE STATE. GOVERNOR SCOTT SIGNED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR THE WORKFORCE AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SIGN E-VERIFY LEGISLATION IF ADAM HADN’T WORKED TO KILL E-VERIFY. WE CAN DO THINGS LIKE E-VERIFY HERE IN FLORIDA, AND IF I’M GOVERNOR I WILL ABSOLUTELY PURSUE THAT COURSE OF ACTION. HE SAID ON STRONG ON BORDERS AND I THINK THAT’S A BIG REASON WHY HE SUPPORTED ME. WE WILL GO ONTO THE NEXT TOPIC. AS WE MENTIONED IT BREAKING JUST A FEW HOURS AGO, YET ANOTHER DEADLY SHOOTING AT THE NEWSROOM OF THE CAPITAL GAZETTE IN IN AND ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE REPORTS OF FIVE PEOPLE KILLED WHICH IS AN ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR STORY. THE SHOOTING AT MARJORIE STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL SHOOK THE NATION TO ITS CORE AND AGAIN THRUST THIS ISSUE OF GUN CONTROL AND SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS INTO THE POLITICAL SPOTLIGHT. PHIL KEATING HAS MORE. GUNS IN FLORIDA HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN BEST FRIENDS. BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT IS WHERE THE STAND YOUR AROUND THE LOBBY CAME BECAME INFAMOUS. BUT ON VALENTINE’S DAY THIS YEAR, PARKLAND HAPPENED. THE DEADLIEST HIGH SCHOOL SHOOTING IN HISTORY WITH 17 DEAD, AND THAT CAME ON THE HEELS OF ORLANDO’S PULSE NIGHTCLUB MASSACRE WITH 50 DEAD. BOTH TRIGGERING STRICTER CALLS FOR GUN CONTROL. RICK SCOTT BUCK TO THE NRA, DISTRICTS THE OPTION TO ARM TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS WHICH THE LARGEST HAVE REFUSED. SINCE THEN, PARKLAND STUDENTS AND PARENTS DEMANDING ACTION ARE NOW REGISTERING YOUNG VOTERS, URGING THEM TO VOTE AGAINST ANY LAWMAKER WHO TAKES MONEY FROM THEM THE GUN LOBBY. REPUBLICANS. RIGHT AFTER PARKLAND, A POLL SUPPORTED A ASSAULT RIFLE BAND. AMONG VOTERS, 18-24 HAS THE LOWEST TURNOUT OF ANY AGE BRACKET. ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT, COMMISSIONER PUTNAM, HE ONCE WANT TO BRAG ABOUT BEING A NRA SELLOUT. DO YOU STILL FEEL THAT WAY? RESPONSIBLE AND SAFE GUN OWNERS WITH THE MONSTER WHO SHOT UP PARKLAND AND THE TERRORIST INSPIRED INDIVIDUAL WHO SHOT UP THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB. DO NOT LET THEM INFLATE IT, DO HAVE BRANDS. WE CANNOT ALLOW THEM TO SAY TO SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS BECAUSE OF WHAT MENTALLY UNSTABLE INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE INSPIRED BY A TERRORIST HAVE DONE TO SOFT TARGETS. IN FLORIDA, THERE ARE MORE THAN 2 MILLION LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS EXERCISING THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS THROUGH CWP’S AND CRIME IN FLORIDA IS AT A SEVEN YEAR LOW. IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DEFEND OUR RIGHTS AND PROTECT OUR STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOLS. THOSE TWO THINGS ARE NOT INCOMPATIBLE. AS YOU HEARD, FLORIDA VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTED SOME OVER TIGHTENING OF GUN LAWS. BUT WHEN GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT ALSO A STAUNCH DEFENDER OF THE SECOND MINUTE SIGN THAT LAW, HE SAID AT THE TIME YOU WOULD HAVE WITH FLORIDA VOTERS? NOT AT ALL. MY WIFE AND I HAVE TWO YOUNG KIDS OWE UNDER THE AGE OF TWO. THE THOUGHT THAT SOMEONE WOULD THOSE PARENTS MUST FEEL, I CAN’T EVEN IMAGINE IT. BUT IT WASN’T BECAUSE OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT THAT THAT HAPPENED, IT WAS UTTER FAILURE OF BOTH THE LOCALS AND THE FBI. IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN GOVERNOR, I WOULD HAVE SIGNED GUN CONTROL AND I WOULD HAVE REMOVED THAT SHERIFF FROM BROWARD COUNTRY. COUNTY. HE FAILED HIS CITIZENS AND HE YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN THE FBI THAT GOT TWO PHONE CALLS ABOUT THIS MONSTER. THE FIRST ONE THEY LOVE, AND THE SECOND ONE, THEY GET ANOTHER ONE. THEY PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER, AND WHAT DID THEY DECIDE TO DO? NOTHING. THEY WENT OUT TO LUNCH. THE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY IS WHAT PUTS THOSE PEOPLE AT RISK. THOSE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED THE NEXT DAY. Bret: WOULD YOU HAVE FIRED GO. HE BROKE PROMISES TO THOSE STUDENTS, AND THAT HAS PUT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AT RISK. THAT INDIVIDUAL WAS EXPELLED FOR A WEAPONS VIOLATION. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT MADE THREE DOZEN VISITS TO THEIR HOME. DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES VISITED THE HOME BECAUSE HE POSTED YOUTUBE VIDEO SAYING, I WANT TO BE A PROFESSIONAL SHOOTER. EVERY SILO OF GOVERNMENT, THOSE CHILDREN WERE LET DOWN. THEY WERE FAILED. AND THAT CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN IN FLORIDA. Martha: COMMISSIONER, SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT EVEN A SILO OF GOVERNMENT THAT YOU OVERWATCH HAD SOME BLAME, BECAUSE THE BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM, THE COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT YOU OVERSAW WAS DOWN FOR A FULL YEAR, AND DURING THAT PERIOD IS WHEN THE POLLS SHOOTING OCCURRED. HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT? COUNTRY WHO PUT THOSE CONCEALED WEAPONS LICENSES THROUGH THREE DATABASES. TO OUR CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. THE THIRD IS FOR NONCRIMINAL OFFENSES. DRUGS, MENTAL ILLNESS, AND MIGRATION ISSUES, DISHONORABLE DISCHARGES FROM THE MILITARY. WHEN I LEARNED WE HAD AN EMPLOYEE THAT WAS NOT DOING THEIR JOB, I HELD THAT EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTABLE. AND YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THEY NEVER PUT PUBLIC SAFETY AT RISK BECAUSE THAT SAME DATABASE PREVENTED THEM FROM PURCHASING A FIREARM AT THE POINT OF SALE. SO FLORIDIANS ARE SAFE. THE INDIVIDUAL WHO LED US DOWN IS NO LONGER WITH MY DEPARTMENT, AND I HELD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. THAT’S WHAT LEADERS DO WHEN YOU YOU DISCOVER THE PROBLEM, YOU INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM AND YOU HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. THAT IS WHAT RICK SCOTT HAS DONE FOR FLORIDA AND THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO AS GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA. Congressman DeSANTISL0: THE PROBLEM WITH THAT ANSWER IS THOUGH, HE DIDN’T ACT LIKE A LEADER, HE COVERED IT UP. IT WAS TO COVER DISCOVERED BY THE MEDIA. WHEN GOVERNOR SCOTT FOUND OUT ABOUT IT, HE SAID IT WAS DISTURBING THAT NO ONE HAD TOLD HIM. IF YOU WERE A LEADER, YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD THE GOVERNOR SCOTT AND GOVERNOR SCOTT WOULD HAVE COME OUT PUBLICLY AND SAID, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED. WE HAD TO FIND OUT FROM NEWS LEADERSHIP. I BELIEVE IN TRANSPARENT LEADERSHIP. YES, THINGS HAPPEN IN AN AGENCY LEVEL WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND NOT TRY TO COVER IT UP. Bret: COMMISSIONER? Commissioner Putnam: I HELD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE AND I HELD MYSELF ACCOUNTABLE. I WENT BEFORE THE PRESS AND ANSWER QUESTIONS UNTIL THEY RAN OUT OF QUESTIONS. WE HAVE PUT SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THIS DOESN’T HAPPEN AGAIN. AND KEEP IN MIND, THE REAL ISSUE HERE IS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT WHO WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS. WHO WANT TO UNDERMINE THE SECOND AMENDMENT WHILE MAKING LEADERS ADMIT WHEN YOU HAVE A BREAKDOWN IN YOUR PROCESS AND YOU FIX IT, AND YOU MOVE ON, AND YOU MAKE FLORIDA A STRONGER, THOSE TWO BACKGROUNDS AND HAS WEIGHED OUR TWO RECORDS, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IS FIRMLY IN MY CAMP. SHERIFF’S KNOW THAT I WILL BE THE BEST GOVERNOR TO KEEP FLORIDIANS SAFE, TO PROTECT YOUR LIBERTIES. TO ELIMINATE THE GANG ACTIVITIES. TO CRACK DOWN ON THE OPIOID CRISIS AND TO PROTECT OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IN THE PROCESS. THAT’S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. Bret: LETS TURN TOPICS TO THE ISSUE OF TRADE. CONGRESSMAN, A STUDY ON TRADE ESTIMATES THAT FLORIDA COULD LOSE NEARLY 25,000 JOBS AS A RESULT OF THE STEEL AND ALUMINUM TARIFFS. THE EUROPEAN UNION JUST ANNOUNCE RETALIATORY TARIFFS TARGETING GOODS SUCH AS ORANGE JUICE AT 25%. SO IS PRESIDENT TRUMP’S TRADE POLICY GOOD FOR FLORIDA? Congressman DeSANTISL0: I HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE IN THE CONGRESS FOR GETTING MORE FUNDING FOR SOME OF OUR PORTS, LIKE IN JACKSONVILLE BECAUSE I THINK THAT CAN BE AN ECONOMIC DRIVER. BUT HERE’S THE THING YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. DONALD TRUMP WROTE THE ART OF THE DEAL. I TALKED TO HIM ABOUT THIS AND HE DOES NOT WANT TO SEE HIM AND STATE WHERE WE HAVE HIGH TARIFFS ACROSS THE BOARD BUT HE ALSO LOOKS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND SAYS WE HAVE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT SELL GOODS TO US AND WE DON’T CHARGE MUCH OF A TARIFF, AND YET WE CAN’T SELL SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS THEY ARE. SO HE’S LOOKING AT THAT IMBALANCE AND SAYING HE WANTS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. SO IF HIS NEGOTIATING ISN’T WORKING, I THINK HE WILL TRY SOMETHING ELSE. THIS IS NOT THE DIRECTION HE’S GOING TO SAY WE WANT HIGH TARIFFS, HE’S TRYING TO GET CONCESSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE HIM THE CHANCE TO DO HIS THING. HE IS THE MASTER NEGOTIATOR. B6 EVEN IF IT’S PAINFUL IN THE SHORT TERM? Congressman DeSANTIS: I BUT I ALSO THINK, IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT CHINA HAS DONE, THEY STEAL OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND THEY CHEAT ON OUR DEALS, AND WE ARE JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE IT’S HUNKY-DORY. AND TO DONALD TRUMP’S CREDIT, NO ONE ELSE WAS WILLING TO TALK ABOUT THAT UNTIL HE CAME ON THE SCENE AND HE IS LEADING WITH CONVICTION ON THIS. SO I WANT TO SEE FLORIDA WITH INTERNATIONAL TRADE ACROSS ALL OF OUR GREAT PORTS BUT I ALSO WANT TO HAVE FIRE DEALS FOR ALL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT’S WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRYING TO DO. Martha: ALONG THE SAME LINES, COMMISSIONER PUTNAM, YOU SEEM TO ECHO HIS TOUGH TALK ON TRADE. HE TALKED ABOUT THE MEXICAN STRAWBERRY GROWERS HAVING AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE U.S. FARMERS. BUT NOW AS YOU SAY, CHINA IS THE OTHER THINGS. EXPERTS WERE AMERICAN FARMERS ARE IMPACTED HERE. SO AS FLORIDA’S TOP AGRICULTURAL OFFICIAL, DO YOU SUPPORT OR OPPOSE THIS TRADE WAR? Commissioner Putnam: I WAS THERE WHEN I FLORIDA SIGNED A BAD DEAL THAT PUT FLORIDA RANCHERS AND FARMERS AT A DISADVANTAGE AND PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS. I HAVE SEEN THIS UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL. THE HAND-WRINGING THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON ABOUT A TRADE WAR. CHINA HAS BEEN IN A TRADE WAR AGAINST THE UNITED STATES FOR DECADES, AS HAS MEXICO. THEY DEVALUE THEIR CURRENCY, THEY STEAL OUR TECHNOLOGIES. I HAVE SEEN GO BACK TO RUSKIN AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER. I CARE MORE ABOUT THE JOBS IN RUSKIN THEN WHAT’S GOING ON IN IT HASN’T EVEN BEEN ENFORCED TO AN EXTENT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT TAKE ON THE TRADE WARS WHO WILL BENEFIT AMERICAN WORKERS, FLORIDA WORKERS, FLORIDA BUSINESSES AND FLORIDA FARMERS. Bret: GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU. Martha: NOW MOVING ONTO THE ISSUE OF ENTITLEMENT. COMMISSIONER PUTNAM, STAYING WITH YOU ON THIS ONE. GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT FOR EXPANDING MEDICAID BECAUSE IT YOUR RECORD ON ENTITLEMENTS AGAINST YOU THIS FALL. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO ALMOST A QUARTER OF FLORIDIANS WHO DEPEND ON THOSE PROGRAMS FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE? Commissioner Putnam: THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THE DEMOCRATS WILL TALK ABOUT EXPANDING GOVERNMENT. THEY WILL TALK ABOUT A GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTH CARE PROGRAM AND THEY WILL TALK ABOUT HOW MANY WAYS TO RAISE YOUR TAXES TO PAY FOR IT. I’M AGAINST THE EXPANSION OF MEDICAID UNDER OBAMACARE BECAUSE THERE ARE OVER 40 COUNTIES IN FLORIDA WHO ONLY HAVE ONE INSURANCE PROVIDER. HOW IS OBAMACARE WORKING OUT FOR 42% OF THE BUDGET. MEDICAID IS ONE-THIRD OF THE UP THE STATE BUDGET, MORE THAN EDUCATION, MORE THAN INFRASTRUCTURE, MORE THAN NATURAL RESOURCES. HAVE HIGHER PAYING JOBS, GREATER ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND GOOD CAREERS. THAT’S THE REPUBLICAN PLAN FOR STRENGTHENING OUR ECONOMY AND GIVING PEOPLE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY HEALTH CARE IN FLORIDA. Martha: IT LET ME ASK YOU QUICKLY, A LOT OF STATES ARE IMPLEMENT IN PROGRAMS OF WORK FOR MEDICAID. YOU JUST MENTION HOW MEDICAID IS GOBBLING UP FUNDING IN FLORIDA. DO YOU SUPPORT WORK FOR Commissioner Putnam: ABSOLUTELY. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE ON PUBLIC
