believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> Donald Trump</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that he had nothing</font>

62
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,330
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh well he</font>

63
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,280
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it so there's no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hartmann</font>

64
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,550
began talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Muller</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you thought</font>

65
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,950
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be correct but</font>

66
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,250
you believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> Donald Trump</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I guess</font>

67
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,680
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> assume no no the client opens up to</font>

68
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,120
their attorney tells<font color="#CCCCCC"> them the whole</font>

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,970
truth<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they could help in in fighting</font>

70
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,110
his case<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

71
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">no Trump's not even gonna tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys</font>

72
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">of course it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

73
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,890
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that was wrong assumption</font>

74
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">number one well the assumption number</font>

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,810
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more important so</font>

76
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,130
understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anna was saying is that</font>

77
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">Magan is not Trump's lawyer he is the</font>

78
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">White House's lawyer it's a different</font>

role

80
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,890
so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the an executive privilege</font>

81
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">is debatable as to what it applies to</font>

82
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,270
and what it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> attorney-client</font>

83
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,400
privilege<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case probably would</font>

84
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">have applied could have been debatable</font>

85
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it doesn't matter because they</font>

86

hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh that's a ton of time that he</font>

94
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,620
spent with Muller giving him all the

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,440
details<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what Trump did the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

96
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">Trump's lawyers didn't bother asking him</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what did you tell Muller what did you</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me like it's it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> insane</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

104
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">wasn't until the New York Times</font>

a lot of stress about<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there's a lot</font>

00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:06,490
transparent<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least on those counts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,080
it turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out they didn't do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then I</font>

take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it turns out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Haney was</font>

transparent for a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason but my</font>

216
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,839
guess is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now McGann and his lawyers</font>

217
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,440
guesses<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh no this moron he wasn't gonna</font>

218
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,360
throw us under the bus<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just had no</font>

219
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was doing</font>

220
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:23,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">McGann now have you spent more time with</font>

221
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:26,500
Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably realizes of course what</font>

222
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,909
was I thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is one of the</font>

223
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:29,560
dumbest guys in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country he had no</font>

224
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,569
strategy<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all right look even if</font>

225
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:34,328
McGann was incorrect<font color="#CCCCCC"> in his assumptions</font>

226
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:37,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">about Trump and what his real agenda was</font>

227
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,059
I think that McGann still did the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

228
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,860
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cooperating with</font>

229
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> glitch Trump is a wild card</font>

230
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we don't know whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or not Trump</font>

231
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:50,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">is I mean I would speculate that</font>

232
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,930
has obstructed<font color="#E5E5E5"> justice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean there's so</font>

233
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,690
many examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> firing James Comey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is one</font>

234
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,570
example constantly badgering<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeff</font>

235
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">sessions for recusing himself is another</font>

236
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,960
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these are all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

237
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very publicly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but nonetheless</font>

238
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">even if you're on the fence and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

239
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,170
to give Trump the benefit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the doubt</font>

240
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">and believe that he is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not attempting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

241
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,400
obstruct justice<font color="#CCCCCC"> I still think it's</font>

242
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,980
important for McGann as the White House

243
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">canceled counsel to protect himself</font>

244
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">because if Trump goes down everyone</font>

245
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,210
around him<font color="#E5E5E5"> is gonna go down with him</font>

246
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,980
anyone who continues<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him and</font>

247
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,860
by the way if you can recall last<font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font>

248
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,510
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was this huge story regarding</font>

249

Trump's personal lawyers Ty Cobb

250
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,730
and and John Dowd they were at a steak

254
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're listening in on conversations</font>

257
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">began because they really believed in</font>

cooperation with Special Counsel<font color="#CCCCCC"> Moeller</font>

260
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,940
and began was like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bad idea</font>

what are you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing so I bring that</font>

262
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,450

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:27,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah and that was a terrible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mistake so</font>

273
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,300
by the way in the story it's revealed

274
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,550
that Trump did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand that</font>

275
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">McGann is not his personal lawyer he</font>

276
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,670
lacks understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> of very simple</font>

277
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,370
concepts he is the White House Counsel

278
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,010
he represents the office<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

279
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,870
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the office well but that's me</font>

280
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,160
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person sitting in the office</font>

281
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's my lawyer isn't he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh god you're so</font>

282
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">stupid</font>

283
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so that created an issue now I'm</font>

284
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,780
again they say and he he claims<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I</font>

285
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,839
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> testify that he broke any laws</font>

286
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">but he has a very expansive</font>

287
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,590
definition of executive<font color="#E5E5E5"> privilege and</font>

288
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,630
what Trump is allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do in the White</font>

289
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,880
House<font color="#E5E5E5"> so did he give them information</font>

290
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that might indicate that there was</font>

291
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,510
obstruction<font color="#E5E5E5"> of justice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well first of all</font>

292
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">a huge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> part of this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that he's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

293
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that told him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that Trump ordered the</font>

294
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,630
firing of Muller<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

295
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,040
others in office would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not do it</font>

296
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">including me yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the prosecutors did</font>

297
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">not know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> until we can talk to them</font>

298
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,990
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> enormous when it comes to</font>

299
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,730
building obstruction of justice case and

300
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">McGann also has details on why he fired</font>

301
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,030
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that he did why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he wants</font>

302
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">sessions to quit right and if it turns</font>

303
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,620
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is because he wants to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

304
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to block the investigation of himself</font>

305
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's obstruction</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of justice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so then</font>

306
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,090
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you turned the prosecutors</font>

307
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,910
according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to investigators that the New</font>

realize hey that White House Counsel can

317
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,540
actually testify against you

318
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,210
don't let him go speak to Muller<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he</font>

319
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,530
didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> until this New York Times</font>

320
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,590
story came out about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much McGann had</font>
