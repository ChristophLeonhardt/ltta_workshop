1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,059
TAYLOR SWIFT HAS WON THE CASE
AGAINST HER AND HAS WON THE CASE

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,970
AGAINST THE DJ WHO SUED HER IN
THE FIRST PLACE.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,700
WHAT IS THE FULL STORY?

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,480
THERE IS A DJ NAMED DAVID
MUELLER FROM COLORADO.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,109
TAYLOR WAS DOING A MEET AND
GREET AND THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN.

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,830
NOW, ACCORDING TO TAYLOR AND NOW
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM, IN THIS

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,850
PHOTO THE MAN, PICTURED ON
THE RIGHT, WAS REACHING

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,180
UNDERNEATH TAYLOR SKIRT AND
GRABBING HER BUNS.

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,240
THE PRESENT ON THE LEFT IS THAT
GUYS EX-GIRLFRIEND WHO UPON

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,349
LEARNING ALL THIS DUMPED HIM.

11
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:33,899
AS A RESULT, TAYLOR TOLD HER MOM
THAT THIS HAPPENED, WHO IS

12
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,719
HER MANAGER AND HER MAN TOLD
THE PERSON WHO DOES ALL THE

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,749
RADIO MEETING SET UP.

14
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:42,219
THEY TOLD THE GUYS EMPLOYER AND
THEY FIRED HIM.

15
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:44,179
AS A RESULT, THAT MAN SUE
TAYLOR.

16
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:46,929
IT BECAME A BIG STORY IN THE
MEDIA.

17
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:51,519
TAYLOR SUIT BACK FOR ONE DOLLAR,
SAYING THAT THIS GUY GROUPS

18
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:55,799
MY BUTT AND SHE JUST
WON THAT CASE.

19
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,889
THEY FOUND IN HER FAVOR AND NOW
HE HAS TO PAY HER ONE DOLLAR.

20
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:02,030
THIS WAS OF COURSE SYMBOLIC.

21
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:14,380
WHAT DID SHE SAY AFTERWARD?

22
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,619
SHE SAID I AM IN A POSITION
ESSENTIALLY RIGHT INTO THIS

23
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:20,630
LAWSUIT WHEN SOMEONE SEXUALLY
ASSAULT ME.

24
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,850
OTHER PEOPLE AREN'T AND IF YOU
DIDN'T LOVE TAYLOR SWIFT BUT FOR

25
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,170
NOW YOU HAVE TO.

26
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,700
IT IS THE LAW.

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,130
I AM NOT SURE THAT IS WHAT
THE RULING SAYS.

28
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,329
I WILL WRITE THAT DOWN.

29
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,119
MY FAVORITE PART OF THE STORY
WAS, REMEMBER, SHE DIDN'T SUE HIM

30
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,009
FIRST, HE STRUCK FIRST AND HE IS
LIKE OH MY GOD, SHE COST ME MY

31
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,210
JOB AND OF COURSE HE CLAIMS HE
DIDN'T GRAB HER ASS.

32
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,960
THE JUDGE DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM AND
IMMEDIATELY THREW OUT HIS LAWSUIT.

33
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,759
THERE LIKE LET'S GET STARTED,
YOUR LAWSUIT IS NONSENSE, GONE.

34
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,869
NOW LET'S HEAR TAYLOR SWIFT.

35
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:55,590
DON'T GET ME WRONG, I'M KIDDING
AROUND.

36
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,390
OF COURSE HE HEARD IT THROUGH AND
MADE THE DECISION.

37
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,639
HE THREW OUT THE PART
WHERE TAYLOR WAS POTENTIALLY TO

38
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:05,899
BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR FUTURE
LOST WAGES AGAINST HIM.

39
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:08,610
THE JUDGE TO SAID LISTEN, TAYLOR
JUST TOLD HER MOM YOU TOUCHED HER

40
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,909
BUTT AND AFTER THAT, IT WENT DOWN
TO YOUR EMPLOYER THAT YOU WOULD

41
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:17,200
DO THIS AND EMBARRASS YOUR RADIO
STATION IN THIS WAY AND SO THE

42
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,092
JUDGE THREW OUT THE CASE SAYING FOR
$300,000, THE REMAINDER OF THAT

43
00:02:21,092 --> 00:02:25,950
GUYS CONTRACT WAS STILL UP FOR
ESSENTIALLY TO BE DECIDED AND

44
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,060
THEY DECIDED NO, NO ONE IS AS
POSSIBLE FOR THAT.

45
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,290
WHAT WAS HIS CONTRACT?

46
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,650
THE REMAINDER OF HIS CONTRACT
WAS UP TO $300,000.

47
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,110
IT WAS 150 A YEAR FOR TWO YEARS.

48
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,620
HE GOT FIRED EARLY FOR
MISCONDUCT.

49
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,360
USUALLY THEY HAVE A MORALS
CLAUSE IN THOSE KINDS OF

50
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
THINGS.

51
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,459
BUT WAIT, DID I MAKE TERRIBLE
MISTAKES IN MY LIFE?

52
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:47,130
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

53
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,330
HOW DOES SOME RANDO DJ IN COLORADO GET
AN INSANE CONTRACT FOR THE

54
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,790
REMAINDER OF HIS CONTRACT IS
$300,000?

55
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,760
THE REMAINDER OF HIS CONTRACT.

56
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,939
ANYWAY, SORRY.

57
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:00,720
THAT WAS SHOCKING INFORMATION.

58
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,430
BY THE WAY, JUST TO GIVE YOU
GUYS A LITTLE MORE,

59
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,790
$300,000, MORE DETAILS IN THE
STORY, THIS INFORMATION

60
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,459
TRAVEL TO HIS EMPLOYER AND HIS
EMPLOYER DIDN'T JUST DECIDE

61
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:17,650
TO FIRE HIM IMMEDIATELY.

62
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,230
THEY DID HIS FULL INVESTIGATION
AND THE DJ KEPT CHANGING A

63
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,010
STORIES AND FINALLY THERE WERE
LIKE WE'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT

64
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,939
BEING HONEST WITH US WE'RE GOING
TO LET YOU GO DIET I THINK

65
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,810
THE JUDGE RULED THE RIGHT WAY IN
THIS CASE AND TAYLOR SWIFT

66
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,160
AND GO OUT OF HER WAY
TO DESTROY HIS LIFE.

67
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,069
SHE DID GO TO THE AUTHORITIES
WHICH THERE IS A CASE TO BE MADE

68
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:41,280
THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE, JUST DON'T
GRAB PEOPLE'S ASSES IF YOU WANT

69
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,180
TO KEEP YOUR JOB.

70
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,290
RECOVERED IT WHEN THIS
LAWSUIT FIRST CAME ABOUT.

71
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,720
IF YOU HAVE ANY SYMPATHY FOR HIM
BECAUSE YOU LIKE HOW CAN THEY

72
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
TELL?

73
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,939
FIRST OF ALL THAT'S WHY THEY DID
TRIALS.

74
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,689
THEY DID A TRIAL DECIDED HE DID
DO IT AT THE JURY DECIDED THAT.

75
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:59,700
AND SECONDARILY, WHEN THEY ASKED
HIM CAN WE GET THAT RECORDING OF

76
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,651
YOU TALKING TO YOUR EMPLOYERS
ABOUT THE INCIDENT BECAUSE THAT

77
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:04,959
WILL BE GREAT EVIDENCE AND YOU
SAY YOU ARE RIGHT, SO THAT WOULD

78
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,480
BE GREAT AND HE IS LIKE I

79
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,720
SPILLED COFFEE ON MY LAPTOP AND
THEY ARE LIKE BUT THERE IS A

80
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,090
HARD DRIVE THIS SHOULD ALSO HAVE

81
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,090
IT.

82
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,610
OH MAN, I LOST THE HARD DRIVE.

83
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,170
BUT YOUR PHONE ALSO RECORDED
IT.

84
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,070
I THREW THAT ONE IN THE GARBAGE.

85
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,560
COME ON.

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,200
THERE WERE WITNESSES
WHO SAW HIM GRAB HER ASS.

87
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,760
THAT IS WHY THEY CAME TO THIS
CONCLUSION.

88
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,910
MY FAVORITE ARE HER RESPONSES
TO HIS LAWYER WHEN THEY WERE

89
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,420
DOING THIS LAWSUIT.

90
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,860
VULTURE DID AN EXPOS…, THE BEST
COMEBACKS FROM TAYLOR SWIFT.

91
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,210
HERE'S SOME EXCERPTS.

92
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:57,380
SHE IS 
THE BEST.

93
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,120
I LOVE HER, AND FINALLY:

94
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,500
SHEíS SO GOOD.

95
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:19,050
BY THE WAY, THE BODYGUARD DID
SEE FROM THE SIDE THAT HE

96
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,050
GRABBED HER ASS.

97
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,110
THE ONLY THING THE BODYGUARD
SAID WAS, I DON'T KNOW IF HE

98
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,780
TOUCHED BARE SKIN, WHICH TAYLOR
SAYS THAT HE DID.

99
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,290
THIS GUY WAS SO BRAZEN HE WENT
UNDER THE SKIRT AND INSIDE HER

100
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,290
UNDERWEAR.

101
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,851
WHILE HIS GIRLFRIEND IS ALSO
POSING IN THE PHOTO WITH HIM.

102
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:41,400
AND THEN HE HAD THE TEMERITY
TO SUE HER FOR THAT.

103
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
SO RIDICULOUS.

104
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,770
ALL RIGHT THAT HEAVILY
CENTERPIECE?

105
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:49,540
I'M GOING TO WRITE AN EMAIL
SAYING HOW GREAT SHE IS AND

106
00:05:49,540 --> 00:00:00,000
SEND IT TO MYSELF SO
I CAN READ IT.
