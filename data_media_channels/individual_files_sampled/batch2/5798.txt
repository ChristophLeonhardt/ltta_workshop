another race to watch in Florida Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron de Santos is under fire for comments he made about his opponent Mayor Andrew Gilliam De Santis says that his comments had nothing to do with race take a listen so we've got to work hard to make sure that we continue Florida going in a good direction let's build off the success we've had on Governor Scott the last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda did you in any way and do you in any way think that was something that was misstated or racist in any way because that's what they were implying it has zero to do with race Shawn all right let's also be very clear sean hannity also campaigned at one point for Ron de santis in Florida with me now is Georgetown professor Michael Eric Dyson and nationally recognized expert on civil rights he has hosted campaign rallies as well with Gilliam and he's also the author of 21 books including what truth sounds like Michael great to have you with us this evening first of all your views of those comments how did you sir hear those comments well either he needs a rebate on the education he paid the tuition he paid for his education had both Yale and Harvard or this man is plainly lying this is not even a dog whistle this is a bullhorn this is amplification to you know magnitudes of you know decibels that everybody can hear it shatters the air it shatters the ear we know what he's doing here he's playing to his racist base he's trying to manipulate racial rhetoric in defense of his position that is ostensibly neutral but at the end of the day and the bottom line is we know that he's playing to that deeply rooted bigotry that is resurged under Donald Trump and that has proved not to be something that will discourage voters from coming out but rather that encourages those who are of that ilk to come forward so he knew what he was doing when he was talking about a tall handsome dark-skinned black man as monkeying up the process he is alluding to images tropes and metaphors of black identity that have been linked to monkeys throughout the history of the racist vision of evolution in this country and indeed in the modern West and let me sir play you Gillan's response to this take listen let me be articulate and clear here which is we're better than this in Florida I believe the congressman can be better than this I regret that his mentor in politics is Donald Trump but I do believe that the voters of the state of Florida are going to reject the politics of division it's clear that the congressman is gonna join Donald Trump and in the swamp we're gonna leave them there we're gonna continue to press to what a higher mark do you sir agree with his remarks both in his assessment and also with that Florida is going to reject that because in your first answer you seem to suggest that they're not they're not necessarily there's not necessarily punishment to pay when a candidate speech like this way to his base well let me first of all acknowledge what he did brilliantly there he said let me be articulate and clear he's already combating the vicious misimpression and misinformation about black people our inability to speak or articulate or to enunciate not only clearly but to express vividly and eloquently those beliefs we have so he was doing a bit of signifying himself right there brilliant kudos to the future Governor Gilliam but look he took the right road here Michelle Obama says when they go low we go high the reality is it's not much to see into the cesspool that that DeSantis is is in he's in Florida there so it's a swamp that needs to be drained to be certain as Donald Trump suggests but yes I think that his viewpoint is not directly opposed to mine I'm saying that it will appeal to those people who already have preconceived ideas about what black people are so on the other hand what Governor Gilliam to be it was saying is that we will not appeal to the nasty vicious beliefs of human beings we will rise above them and organize the logic of democracy around a different pivot what is that pivot we come together we have class and economic issues together beyond race we have considerations of health care we have considerations of money we have considerations of the the earning a decent wage those things are extremely important and what Gilliam is saying here is that we're not going to pitch ourselves so the net consideration of a DeSantis who's trying to send dog whistles and really bull horns to his people the people of Florida who are beyond that the white people who don't agree with him the white voters who understand that this is the manipulation of racial rhetoric in defense of his own position but it has nothing to do with politics at its best I think in that sense Gilliam is right those people will prevail and I think he has a great chance of becoming the next governor of the state of Florida sir let me switch gears really quickly and get your thoughts as well on Kanye West a cultural force of his own if you will he's defending president Trump for some of the comments he's made in the past your response to Kanye West's defense of President Trump saying that he also wants to be liked by black people wants to be recognized and accepted for trying to do good things for black people you know like you know Gilliam West is a friend of mine I love him he's a genius when it comes to music he was early on in his career courageous and brave and going against the powers that be but this sad capitulation to the force of bigotry that is Donald Trump this orange apparition that appears out of nowhere super cloud the American horizon of consciousness and dignity it's a shame that Kanye West can't simply say if I earlier said that George Bush doesn't care for black people when Jimmy Kimmel asked him what makes you believe that Donald Trump's cares for black people you know he has he's silent and then he comes back with this answer he says Donald Trump wants to be liked by black people who doesn't even those who are bigots would like for their viewpoints to be accepted and tolerated by most people including black people this has nothing to do with the moral particularity or the substance ethically of Donald Trump's beliefs and Kanye West is doing a two-step around the issue here he refuses to express the fact that Donald Trump has been vicious has been negligent has been horrible when it comes to black people and Kanye West is looking for a justification for his continued affiliation and alliance with a man who is proven in no uncertain terms to be an enemy to not only the forces of democracy but the african-american people I love you Kanye West but shame on you don't go to those extensive you know to those extents to justify him when I phone conversation with Kanye after he put my tweets on blast so to speak my texts to him and he talked to me he says look I'm looking for people who are brave and courageous and who speak their mind well we call upon you Kanye West to be informed before you speak he apologized for making the statement about you know slavery as a choice but he's got to be better informed if you're gonna speak up and speak out at least speak from experience in something that is insightful hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or
