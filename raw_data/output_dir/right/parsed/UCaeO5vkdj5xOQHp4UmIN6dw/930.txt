- And this is one thing that
does bother me on both sides,
is the sort of tokenism
that adheres to both sides.
So on the one side
you'll see from the left
this idea that if you are
gay then you cannot - Yeah.
be conservative or as
you saw with Kanye West
if you're legitimately black or you care
about black folks then you
can't actually be a fan
of President Trump, you can't
be an independent thinker
in any way and then I do
think that there are some
folks on the right, and there's a question
about the right too.
Which, they'll look at somebody
like you or like a Kanye
and instead of saying,
okay that's an individual
who agrees with me, that's really awesome,
they'll say, ooh, look,
a gay guy agrees with me.
- Yes.
- And all of a sudden it's
like, ooh, total different.
- So
- Whereas I think the
proper response to that
is, okay, so he's gay,
now whatever, we agree.
That's the important thing, right?
- Yeah, I mean, look, this
is where nobody is fully
right all the time, you know
what I mean, like we all
have our internal biases,
we all are constantly
trying to figure, well if
you're an honest thinker,
you're trying to figure
what's going on, so yes,
to both sides kind of
pick and choose when they
want to play identity
politics and all that.
For me, as someone that
came from the left,
I know it so well that line of thinking
and it basically spread
like a virus throughout
all of the left.
If you look at my show like
the first time I had you on,
which is almost three years ago already.
- Yeah.
And again, we did not know each other
and I think you came
in very ready to fight,
you were like, oh I'm
sitting down with a lefty,
- Right.
You were ready to fight
and I really was there
- To have a conversation.
- Let's do it and look
what's happened in these last
couple of years where we've
become allies in this case.
- Yeah.
