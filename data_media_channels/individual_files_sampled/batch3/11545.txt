the Swiss mountain resort of Davos has opened its doors for the annual World Economic Forum and this year it's pulled in a record number of world leaders including the US president but many are determined to show that he is not welcome around 2000 people marched through the streets of Zurich to denounce Trump's visit and the entire gathering several smaller protests took place elsewhere in Switzerland including Geneva artis Jacqueline Vova takes a closer look at what is on the agenda at the Davos forum the World Economic Forum is well underway here in the scenic town of Davos nestled in the Swiss Alps and the guest list is chock full of political heavyweights such as Mae Merkel McCrone and too many surprised Trump no one expected mr. America first to even consider participating in a forum whose theme boasts the globalist idea of creating a shared future in a fractured world and yet he slotted to be the last Speaker of the event and will most likely use the opportunity to soapbox about his own brand of economic nationalism and while the political elite continue to enjoy the conference and Rob elbows the IMF has warned that the current economic climate has caused voters to lose faith in them voters and many advanced economies have soured on political establishments doubting their ability to deliver broadly shared growth in the face of tepid real wage gains reduced labor shares and national income and rising job polarization and in reality that discontent really shouldn't be all that surprising given that those in the 99% aren't the ones enjoying the benefits of the recent economic growth Oxfam who works towards the relief of global poverty has recently put out a report outlining just how dire the situation is revealing that in 2017 82% of the wealth generated went to the top one percent the number of billionaires skyrocketed leaving us with now over 2,000 billionaires worldwide and as that economic crisis continues the focus of Davos seems to have blurred a bit at the politics of 2017 leak in for the first time ever the summit is chaired solely by women and a number of the discussions really don't seem to have anything to do with economics at all focusing instead on race privilege and harassment all the greatest hits from the past year the social issues of 2017 including inclusiveness harassment that was mentioned and other things have been everywhere in the news that sounds important maybe but not as important as the economics of the Davos summit I think that the North America Europe Japan and all the developed nations have never been as inclusive as they are now all tolerance by the way of course there are reactions to to certain things like the migration crisis but the people are used to it now much more than before and we are very inclusive it's not a time for Crusades anymore the delegation from the Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab is in Davos they spoke to our team I would say it's the trend from the last year's and actually one of the main topics of this year in Davos its fragmentation of the world and fortunately it's happening there is a global geopolitical tensions and fights between countries and it backfires private companies in fact far as US I would say that the crash in the United States is enormous it's the biggest it's really disappointing frustrating and surprising for me that the private company can be limited in its operations in a country with no reasons with no effects just by decision of the US government it's really frustrating because it means that we can't protect our organizations in US government and our product is one of the best according to independent and this is just means that they they leave themselves unprotected from from cybercrime and from cyberattacks which is really frustrated and I believe that in a long term this is just very very wrong decision to be an independent private company from its operation in the country delegates arriving at the World Economic Forum have been literally snowed under over the past week Davos has seen nearly two meters of snowfall in the heaviest in nearly two decades traffic has been disrupted with many delegates struggling to reach the venue there's also a high risk of avalanches but many people are seeing the bright side that was reality economic environmental social and political fragility in avalanche territory a loud noise can bring the whole mountain down and Donald Trump comes to town on Friday turns out Davos is actually this social experiment when you gather a bunch of VVIP s then make them carry their own luggage through the snow and stand in lines with each other elbows are out wonder what would happen if Davos got snowed in and no one could leave for a week and the world realized that it could run itself without the business and political elite
