hey I'm here to tell you that I was wrong when I said that Republicans couldn't be any more cruel than they've already been yesterday millions of Americans watched a victim of assault testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in many ways she was the perfect witness calm collected and in moments emotional wreck Cavanaugh on the other hand was entitled angry and just plain incomprehensible at times yes we drank beer I liked beer still like beer that's just the guy who goes to church like he brushes his teeth and he loves beer calendars working out and hates sexual assault but most importantly how dare you deny this man his god-given position on the Supreme Court something he was destined to achieve his entire life he is the real victim here so yesterday's hearings essentially played out like a trial with no investigation into the victims claims and a job interview for the judge and Republicans handled this in the most transparently cruel way possible first they hired a conservative female sexual assault prosecutor and given the fact that there was no prior investigation she was simply there to cross-examine a victim which she did by trying to undermine her and pick up arter testimony I also saw on your CV that you list the following interest of surfing travel and you in parentheses put Hawaii Costa Rica South Pacific Islands in French Polynesia have you been all to those places correct by airplane yes you claim to fear planes but your facebook says you love travel is a funny line coming from the camp that won't let the other accused principal mark judge testify in these hearings due to his fear of public speaking I'd like to sympathize with mark judge but he's literally a public speaker and while Mitchell tried to undermine the victim's credibility her line of questioning served only to beef up the judges testimony after initially affirming Cavanaugh's arguments with simple yes and no question she was quickly pulled by the GOP committee members as soon as she started asking questions about how many beers is too many beers and dates on his calendar here are some other glaring issues of this entire process where these people tasked with upholding justice showed how little they care for it first off I found the whole notion that this is a left-wing conspiracy to be funny since this isn't Alex Jones ranting he's a supreme court of the United States nominee millions of dollars in money from outside left opposition groups this of course is projection since I had one of my biggest donors has the only interest in the court gave a check for a million dollars today for our ad campaign to basically could to help Cavanaugh get through this thing and he said to me if you need more I'll put 20 big businessmen together we'll raise the money to make this guy he deserves to be on this Court and make him on this Court that's ed Rowland's literally admitting that they're gonna put millions and millions of dollars behind ensuring that Cavanaugh becomes the SCOTUS they're real cool guys another insane thing was Cavanaugh talking up his innocence without directly attacking dr. Ford whom the Republicans also performative ly say they believe was a victim just not a victim of Cavanaugh's which is an insane defense one originally floated by Ann Whelan before being promptly debunked it's also very interesting to me that Republicans are on fire about false accusations destroying men's lives but they were so quick to make one about a totally random person in an effort to save Kavanagh and another glaring issue was the fact that mark judge a principal also being accused for his involvement was not there to testify he simply wrote a letter saying he doesn't recall these events and that was enough for everybody I guess how can anyone claim that this has been a fair process under these circumstances is absolutely beyond me also this past week more accusations started coming up about Brett Kavanaugh yet during these hearings there was virtually no mention of those other accusations and the only time Republicans brought up the allegation Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer described they brushed aside by claiming incorrectly that even the New York Times had passed on the story ever Ramirez was not hurt on this day because the Republican Committee members effectively denied her that right and then they turned around and claimed her accusations weren't credible without even hearing her so I guess all is well in DC and as we hang the future of the Supreme Court on a couple of Republicans not behaving like political drones and grow a spine and not vote to confirm Kavanagh but don't worry the Federalist Society has plenty of other nominees that will push equally awful positions help and conservatives achieve their ultimate project of eradicating the middle class once and for all at this point we're just looking for a person who wasn't accused of sexual misconduct assuming the GOP can find one did you know that toi D network is now available on youtubes new streaming platform YouTube TV get access to full t whitey episodes and exclusive shows by signing up for youtube TV today all new subscribers get a seven day free eyal so head on over to YouTube TV and search for the TYT Network Channel
