the republican tax bill was a massive multi trillion dollar giveaway to corporations and the 1% but in the wake of its passage a lot of corporations including things like Comcast and Walmart and AT&T put out these big press releases about bonuses that they're giving to their workers supposedly totally not because are totally because of the tax bill doesn't matter if they've been negotiating with the Union for a year for these things doesn't matter if the factories they were announcing had actually been announced months before it was so so because of the tax bill they wanted you to believe and one of the reasons they did that all that PR was because while they're giving out these thousand dollar bonuses in many cases as we've broken down over the past few weeks they were also cutting thousands of jobs or they were limiting wage increases for their workers and things of that sort and often with the fine print the bonuses weren't what they appeared to be anyway they would say 100,000 workers getting thousand dollar bonuses up to $1,000 if you'd been working for us for twenty years so for the vast majority of people they wouldn't be getting anything like that but it all sounded good and we've done what we can to fight back against that narrative but now let's find out if it's actually working at least in a test case Fox News went to a cafe to find out what actual voters think about these bonuses being given out by corporations in comparison to the huge amounts of money the corporations are getting here's what they found out Nancy Pelosi said that breadcrumbs are what these thousand dollar bonuses are what does $1,000 bonus mean to real people well for one thing it's a very very big deal you know when you've worked for a company and they want to give you a thousand dollars just because our president gave us a tax break that's to me it's a big deal we've been called deplorable and everything else but this deplorable appreciates those bread crumbs service something to say about respected this president he didn't say anything about deplorable I feel like they told her to say something like that because nothing about the poll was actually came up there and so she said it's a big deal which if you actually got a thousand dollars would be a big deal of course if Walmart is and gonna cut your job not as big of a deal and also not because of the tax cut President Trump gave us in many cases these are the bonuses they get at the end of every year or again unions have been negotiating it for a year but at least for some voters none of that matters the message has gone through as intended well look in some ways I understand what she's saying a thousand dollars is a big deal to a lot of workers and so if she got a thousand-dollar check and she's happy about it great that makes sense now it's a little bit like what Republicans have been charging Democrats with all these years where they say oh they just hand our goodies to be able to get their voters to vote for them yeah kind of like a thousand dollar check they accused Obama of handing out Obama phones they said oh yeah they just give it away money these people who don't want to work and even in things like their Earned Income Tax Credit where you literally have to work in order to receive it so now when they give away goodies like Santa Claus all of a sudden they're like yeah well I like those bread crumbs they're yummy for my tummy so it's that's part of it but the other thing is she to be fair to her and unfair to Trump in the Republicans in Fox News like it so far she she doesn't necessarily hear the story of all the Sam's Clubs that closed so she didn't get fired other people at Walmart got fired at the same time they closed down a lot of stores thousand people lost their jobs but since she didn't lose her job and she got a check she thinks yeah I like that I'm gonna vote for them again now again and she doesn't know the context that most of those companies Walmart 18 th said are doing those checks at most it is ten percent of only one year of their tax cuts they're keeping the other 90% and then the rest of the years they're keeping a hundred percent so without that context because she doesn't watch The Young Turks you could understand why she had the reaction that she did if you know her please link her to one of her videos because we're not against her like if it was if these bonuses were what they seem to be that would be awesome we were exactly the people who'd be pushing for that and far more which I'll get into but it's not is being deceived unfortunately we broke down for a number of these different companies their bonus packages amounted to something like point zero to seven percent of the revenue for a year even though they're gonna be making billions off these tax cuts and the execs at those companies will be making in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars every single year from these tax cuts so they are just bread crumbs because they're intended to deceive you to send you off a path where you never realize that huge quantities of money are being given to the people with all the real political and economic power in this country and I got I mentioned something about this like a week ago that tiny bit of money for regular workers tons of money for the rich and some conservative woman tweeted to me man you're just so mad that they're getting this thousand dollars aren't you I love your tears or something like that and I didn't respond to her because she seemed kind of stupid but if I had I would have said no I'm not against the thousand dollars here's what I want let's see if you actually are in the corner for these people like the people in that cafe I don't want a thousand dollars I want a livable goddamn wage for her I want consistent raises that keep up with or exceed cost-of-living increases I want her insurance to not skyrocket because 13 million people gonna be thrown off their insurance plans because of that tax bill I want experiments in basic income I want her to get free access to health insurance I want her kids to get free access to to schooling and things like that I want actual economic power to be put back in the pockets of the people who are doing the real work in America I don't want one time maybe $1,000 if you've been working there for 20 years I want real substantive change to the entire goddamn economic system we have do you support that no you want bread crumbs preach it brother teach it I didn't know I was on with Pastor John today okay and I like how the Republicans have outdone marie-antoinette here oh they don't have bread well then give them bread crumbs it's it's bread and circuses the bread is $1,000 Walmart employees the circuses ice raids and feuds with North Korea and other entertaining BS like and they're hoping that you will be so distracted by those sorts of things that you don't understand what is actually ongoing in this country you just watch the video by the young turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
