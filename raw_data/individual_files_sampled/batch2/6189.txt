so welcome to what now Democrats how many people were here yesterday I'm just curious raise your hands real a lot of people here yes Wow okay so you may have heard me say this before but when we started political year one we had a hundred and thirty eight tickets sold with a couple of weeks to go we ended up with about ten thousand people this year over the two days and so I think initially the question was are people in Southern California do they really care about politics what do you think and we've got a couple of people here have you been here all three years selling jank you you've definitely been here all three years okay crystal this is your is your newbie so crystal is our moderator she's an author activist TV host and president of the people's house project crystal ball good morning everyone thank you so much for skipping brunch to come see us we appreciate it so who is excited to fix the Democratic Party and out in an hour no big deal we've got the right panel here to take that on I do have one ground roll here if everybody agrees to this on the stage this is a panel focused on what we can do to move the Democratic Party forward we talked a lot about Trump in our daily lives we talked a lot about Trump on the news let's not even say the word Trump it'll be a blessed relief for me at least so with that let's go ahead and get to introducing this fabulous panel first to my left she is the first woman elected to represent the state of Minnesota in the United States Senate please welcome next up we have author commentator and one of the top political consultants ever in the United States of America Bob Strom up next we have the founder and CEO of the Young Turks and the host of the flagship show got a few fans here Jane nicely done hometown advantage no fair next up we have democratic strategist CNN political commentator and national press secretary for senator Bernie Sanders and last but never least we have political commentator for cen CNN and The Daily Beast named one of the 100 most influential pundits ever of all time Sally cone so to set the stage a couple background facts which I'm sure everybody on the panel and probably everyone in the room is familiar with the problems in the Democratic Party go beyond one election over the past number of years we've lost a thousand plus State Legislative seats we've lost governor's mansions we've lost control of the house we have the smallest house caucus since reconstruction we've lost control of the Senate and 60 percent of the country lives under complete GOP rule so the problems go deeper I think we would all admit then one failed election in 2016 so to set the stage here I'd love to get briefly starting with you senator and going down the line from everybody if you ask the average voter today what their impression what their view of the Democratic Party is what would they say and what would you like them to say well I think that this has changed in the last few months as the party has evolved some when you look at from day two after the inauguration not saying a name where millions of people showed up to March day 9 at the airports I think has changed some I think if you ask them back after the election they would use some words like stale and things like that and I think now we are reaching a new point in our party and it's only moving forward and it's about resisting but it's also about insisting on a better way forward and that is about standing up for people and leaving no one behind which sadly in this last election I think there was too much of that going on this time we are geared up to have an economic focused agenda that stands up for people and makes things better for the average person because that in the past that is not what sadly for us even though we had the right policies we stand Wiis we stood for and especially in the Midwest where I am from thank you my husband is the third of six boys in his family and there were so many kids in this station where I that he would often get lost and left at a gas station and they wouldn't notice it exactly and so this time we are not gonna let the Midwest get left at the gas station first I would say that I agree with that and I think that the fight Democrats have just made against the health proposal of He Who Shall Not Be Named has has helped to define the party or begun the process of redefining the party to the country and we now have to go out and I believe argue for fight for and stand for attacks on individual income inequality for increasing the minimum wage for actually creating genuine opportunities to go to college my dad was a tool and die maker I went to Georgetown and Harvard that's really hard for someone now because the costs are just so absolutely out of control and if you ask me what I'd like people to say next year and in 2020 I'd like people to say that we stand for both economic justice and social justice that I reject the the fight that's gone on in some parts of the Democratic Party saying oh we have to be for one or the other that's ridiculous I mean historically this party has been the party that has been for both of those and if we're not for those two things then what the hell do we exist for social justice and economic justice I guess that would make your justice Democrat so look I'm going to be a little bit harsher in my assessment of the Democratic Party and I don't think that that's gonna surprise many of you so I I think that even crystals statement of their failures is an understatement lost the house the Senate the Supreme Court they lost to a guy that had a 37 percent approval rating on the day of the election which is unimaginable they have lost 69 out of the 99 state legislatures so with that stunning record of failure they have to at least raise their hand and said say we are doing it wrong and American people for whatever reason don't like us let's figure out what that reason is and I'll tell you I'll tell you what it is so to your question crystal they will say if you ask them about the Democratic Party they will say the establishment and that is a miserable thing to say so that is a label that is disastrous and will lead to far more electoral defeats so what direction should they go they should stop the corruption so that is not personal it is systemic corruption when you take money from millionaires and billionaires and you do it systematically and corporations you will represent them we know that and so people get upset at me when I say it but I'm the messenger I it doesn't matter what I say what matters is what the American people actually believe and they're showing it at the polls so you can get mad at me and go no no no we're not systemically corrupt I took billions of dollars but that didn't affect my vote at all but then people won't show up to vote for you because they find that proposition comical absolutely comical so you what direction should we go complete and utter anti-corruption we will not represent corporations we will not represent the rich we will represent the voters so last thing if you're gonna represent the voters what do you do it's actually exceedingly simple and to the great Democratic advantage look at the polling we win and crush on every issue Social Security 84% Medicare 77% whether it's against Wars to protect against tax cuts for the rich there's not an issue we lose on actually run on those issues Medicare is at 77 Medicare for all is at 60% the country is saying that is a government program that works let us in let us in the Medicare why won't you just let us into Medicare it's not hard I mean are you telling me that the position that 60% of the country of the country agrees with now sixty-one percent say the government the federal government should run health care what is difficult about this and you know what it is it's it's the drug companies and the health insurance companies that are donating to the politicians so I have been fortunate to sit in a number of different focus groups with quote unquote real people as of late and actually go out there and talk to these real people that people assume we don't speak to because we live in DC in New York or even California so real people don't also live in California and folks are saying so I think some of the what people say about the party right now is they like that the party has stood up against healthcare but they're not sure what the party is for and so if you ask them you know who was the Democratic Party for I've been places where they they have said well they're not even they're not for working people and that was shocking to you know folks like myself with some other people who know what the Democratic Party says it stands for but people will say that the Democratic Party doesn't actually stand for working people they don't know what it stands for so I would hope that I know right shocking right it's that so I would hope actually Bob stole what I was gonna say I would hope that a year from now two years from now Pete or heck a month from now people will say that the Democratic Party stands for working people they stand for economic justice and social justice they stand for people who believe that health care right not a privilege they stand for they stand for these basic human rights that that's all we're talking about that people should have and I think we can get there I think the party has definitely made some fumbles but I don't think it's anything they can't be fixed and folks just have to be willing to come to the table and do things differently and sometimes that's hard to do well I'll try to say something different there's a lot of what I heard that I agree with you know first of all look I just to pick up on where a chunk left off I completely one thousand one hundred percent agree campaign finance reform is a fundamental fix we need to get control back of our democracy and take it away from big moneyed interests period it remains interesting though that both parties take money from money and interest in big business and still I side with one party over the other so in other words it's not clearly the extent to which that's I don't know what that voters are going out and saying well you know the Democrats take money from corporate interests and therefore I'm gonna vote for Republicans who take money from corporate interests it I do think it stops Democrats from upholding and living up to our true values now that being said there's a lot of other things that stop the Democrats from upholding what I always believed were our true values and that's my my sense of the parties change and the meaning of parties has changed over history and if we go into the other room where all the conservatives are they'll tell you that once upon the time the Democrats were the party that opposed civil rights opposed racial justice and that was true and you know in 1964 the American public actually thought that the Republicans and Democrats felt the same felt the same about racial justice that the parties stood on the same plank same position a year later they said the Democrats are the party of racial justice and as I was growing up as a Democrat in this country I thought that the Democrats were the party of the underdog that's what drew me to be a Democrat the the Democratic legacy of the 1960s the 1970s the 1980s we were the party that stood for social justice and economic justice and we stood for the underdog and what we've seen happen over time and it didn't just start in this election it was partly what happened under Obama partly what happened under Rahm Emmanuel's shepherding of Congress partly what happened under Bill Clinton was we saw the party of the people become the party of the elite and we just had an election where I'm not gonna name him but we're a populist billionaire or millionaire we don't know a populist with a few thousand dollars in the bank and a really big plane a populist Republican beat an establishment elite democrat that is fundamentally and this isn't to pin anything on Hillary but that is fundamentally that that reflects a it's not just about her as a candidate it's not just about this election it reflects a Mis shaping of our party and what we stand for over time I want us to look we are we I think reorganizing as a country away from conventional left-right we've seen this in this election certainly and the whole world is moving toward a more populism versus elite dynamic and the question is the question at this juncture is are we going to be a inclusive populism or are we gonna be an exclusionary populism a populism of hate and I want to see the Democrats be the party of participatory inclusion people inclusive people driven populism that's the party that will win elections going forward it's also by the way the party that will do the right friggin thing and not just care about winning elections I think that I think that's a very profound point because what I would say Thank You Kristal anytime Sally that's what I'm here for what I would say is that part of the way that the party got off track was with an obsession with winning which has only led to losing it's not about saying we're different it's about actually being different into your points Sally I think if you ask the average voter and I live in Kentucky now so I get to talk to regular folks a lot to them if you ask them they will tell you that it is the party of elites and that we condescending and out of touch and there's truth to that caricature it's not all true but there's truth to that caricature senator klobuchar what I want to ask you with that in mind is to the party's credit there's an awareness that we can't just be against we have to have a positive agenda something you've been working very hard on which I'm extremely grateful for but as we roll out that new agenda the better deal our Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer the right matter question what a question okay I think we need messengers from all over the country and those messengers include our leadership of course but they also include mayors and people who you might not have seen on TV before and I think of Bernie Sanders campaign brought a lot of things to our party but that was one of them the need to have other voices and especially voices Nancy's from this state Chuck is from another state on the East Coast so I think you seem you need voices in the middle but I think just as important is that is what we're saying and that this agenda has to be real and it has to reflect this new economy the gig economy where people aren't just staying at one job and they're gonna have to bring their health care and bring their benefits with them and find ways to save I think it's about as our friends up here so beautifully said it's about taking on a lot of these big interests for the first time when we stood there a group of us and announces agenda including Elizabeth Warren we talked about antitrust now that might sound like super boring or maybe you're thinking Teddy Roosevelt but this is taking on a situation where more and more companies have merged so we actually have 50% more mergers than we have had in decades right and that is consolidated power and when you look at some of the things that have been happening to people a lot of that is because they are losing their voice in this democracy they're losing their voice because a citizens united and we should pass a constitutional amendment to overturn citizen United this this is about changing our laws governing competition you it's everything from airlines to hospitals to beer it's even hit beer when beer companies control that's really serious stuff when they control all the distribution line under them that's a problem and then something that I've been working on for years which is the pharmaceutical issue so Bernie and I did an amendment this this beginning of the year and we're now getting more and more people on our side to support this to simply say you know in my state and in Vermont we can see Canada from our porch right so how come that the drugs in Canada are half the price of what they are in America that is wrong we have the most expensive drugs in the country so by unleashing the power of 41 million seniors you didn't think I was going to go there but I am and by the way one of our best best allies in this fight against that mean-spirited to use the guys words mean health care bill was AARP and to onlet you got a chair to unleash the power of 41 million seniors so that they can negotiate prices that's going to make a difference for everyone to allow for more competition in the drug martin market drugs from canada to allow for more generics to get on the market these are all things that we have to do and so when we talk about a new agenda it is not just taking the old ideas it is actually coming up with some new ideas that stands up for economic justice and stands up for people got such a round of applause when I was mentioned that's amazing thank go ahead can I jump in on that so I think Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats have gone some of the way towards getting better and so the new proposal is has parts of it that I really like the antitrust stuff is great it's an absolute crime that we can't negotiate drug prices for at Medicare and that should be fixed immediately and it shows the hypocrisy of Donald Trump oh sorry but but let's keep it real but let's keep it real Obama didn't change that rule for eight years he didn't he didn't that's how we lost people okay so all right so chant you're Schumer cut on the right Road okay I wish you'd get there a lot quicker Pelosi says she's not for Medicare for all terrible terrible oh it's a bridge too far for who obviously not according to the polling the American people let alone your own party which is overwhelming over 80 percent in favor of it it's a bridge too far for our donors they say you're too maybe your time has come and gone she says no I still raise the most money that's exactly what the problem is okay so so I but mainly it's it's never personal its but when I want to break down some of the myths that you see on TV which is an establishment factory so they went out all the sudden Bernie Sanders is the number one most popular politician in the country and I was told I was told over and over again that in the primaries if someone is the leader of the Democratic Party everyone else should step aside remember when we heard that and now all of a sudden establishment media in cahoots with establishment Democrats tell us we need fresh faces I don't remember them saying that about Hillary Clinton I don't remember it was only a year ago and I bring that up now because how come we need fresh faces when Bernie's leading but we don't need fresh faces when is Schumer and Pelosi I would like to hear from you first because I think there's some interesting points here number one I do think that the the focus in particular on monopoly and on breaking up trust that's gonna be an increasingly important issue that has impacts on all of our lives and watch for my bill next week we'll be looking for that bill but the party is facing a complete a complete loss of trust and credibility I mean that's where we are we have around the same approval rating as the one who shall not be named so can anyone even listening to the message no matter how great it is if we don't have the right messengers you know so I do believe we need we need good credible and in some instances better messengers across the board I will say that there is polling that supports that I don't care how partisan people think we really are and how divided we are folks are still watching television that's why it's important for members of Congress and mayors and governors who get on television and talk about what the party is doing we should also do the young turks we should also be getting these really fabulous podcasts but we have to get on TV because people are still turned on their televisions they're still watching TV and so when all you're seeing on television is Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia and Republican members and commentators like us who are on tell who are on segments talking about Russia not because Russia it's not and I'm not saying Russia is not important but when that's all the folks who are watching television consuming it across the country get a better deal doesn't break through you don't get to hear specifically about what's what the party is doing or what's going on so that's when we have to get creative get out in our community so on and so forth look I think clearly I think bernie is great right he's absolutely amazing y'all clap for Bernie but the base of the Democrat be clear I want to be very clear when I say this the base of the Democratic Party is a hodgepodge of some really amazing people that we have not been talking about we talk a lot about working people and there's been this really this big focus on getting back quote-unquote those working-class I would read that as white working-class voters that we lost an election quote-unquote let me help let me share something with you America is browning by 2032 the working class in America will be majority minority by 2040 America will be majority minority and so the when we talk about winning back those voters when to Donald Trump be clear only 8% of these only 8% of voters are voters we refer to as Obama Trump voters that's 8 percent of the electorate that's still a really big number given everybody devoted but that's not everybody so we need to talk about working-class people black working class people Latino working class people Korean working class people Asian American working class people working class people that are women women go to work we like jobs working-class people that are gay then are LGBTQ but we also need to talk about Millennials and so we need to talk about Millennials which is the most diverse generation ever by the way we need to talk about black women because black women have literally pushed pulled galvanize and kept the Republican Park at the Democratic Party afloat and they have yet to get so much as a thank you card Thanks following this election and so while I'm with that we need to take thereof there are myriad of things that people are talking about that is wrong with the party that some new things need to come in and I think some things that all my friends appear on the stage that said are correct and a lot of the things that Bernie have said it right but we cannot go away from the base and what I see happening do you see a tension though between speaking to working-class voters of all races and genders and political persuasions and staying with do you again working-class people are black to working class people are Latino it is the rhetoric I don't know if y'all have ever been there's a place called McDowell County West Virginia it is one of the most resilient communities I have ever been to it is also one of the widest I to be frank I'm also from Omaha Nebraska I'm from one of those really red places those flyover States that people talk about they're black people in Nebraska as well the people in McDowell County West Virginia have some of the same issues and are facing some of the same trials as folks in downtown Chicago Illinois like the economic issues cut across the board across the board people want jobs across the board people want better healthcare across the board premiums are too damn high across the board people want more competition in the markets so we have to break down the rhetoric but when we continue to play into this false dichotomy until this false choice between whether we talk to the working-class people again when people say that they're really talking about white working-class people or do we talk to the base and social justice issues at the base that's false if we just talk frankly and authentically about the issues we will break through and I think that's what the party needs to do so when the party goes on a tour across the country and brings no young people brings no black women that's a problem for me let me ask you Sally because I think you know one thing here and and my big push is it's not just about the messaging the party actually has to be a different party but one thing that I see a sort of a consistent issue is when people say working class frequently they are referring to the white working class and even when they're not there's an assumption that they are is there another as a you know somebody who does a lot of television and somebody white it's okay white it's somebody who's white how can you say it differently Sally speak to us is there another phrase is there a different language we can use to get at this because it's something I'm very sensitive so I want to go deeper than language I'm gonna double down on what Simone just said always brilliant and I'm gonna go like ten steps further to maybe piss some people off sorry first of all I actually make an assumption and maybe I'm just an overly generous human being I've been accused of that but I make an assumption that most leaders in the Democratic Party I won't name names but some of the names who come across will come across this conversation if you ask them in private with a promise that would never be public would say hell yeah I support Medicare for all hell yeah the most radical things we could think of I actually think and this wasn't always my sense around same-sex marriage that in fact our party's leaders privately were there but they didn't think publicly they could support it and so that's why the hemmed in hard and that kind of discomfort is what people sense that they sense if you're not being we call it authenticity but you know it you feel it and my sense of why that is right is not because is because of this sense that to be a legitimate party to be a winning party we have to appeal to the middle and I think that is defined in two ways one it's defined in a sort of pre hyper-partisanship notion about swing voters who are disappearing by the day and there's so there's a kind of rational elephant element to it but also let's be very frank I think our politics exist within a framework of white normative hegemony what we might call white supremacy that the most legitimate voters are white voters come on Sally you better preach and so give us this word on this Sunday afternoon all right it's Sunday and so I tell you now I'm sorry no but but seriously that there is a and we've heard it in we heard it in the you know that all the people who voted for Barack Obama were not legitimate voters right we've heard that critique that attack and there is some sense I think unconsciously not often consciously that if you did not win if you did not win an election with a majority of white white working-class white middle class just white voters you didn't really win that your vote that your election is somehow less than what do we want to call it legitimate triumphant right and and so I want to say look that if people haven't read the work of Steve Phillips who I think is one of the best electoral political scholars in the country there is enough progressive whites and voters of color for the Democrats to be the dominant political party going forward right now and into the future and we what is it in our psyche that we don't say right African American women by far the most loyal political vote we bought it a ninety five percent by Hillary Clinton but what for instance if we had had african-american turnout just African American turnout in the last election at forget Obama it was higher under Obama was sixty six percent I think but under Kerry it was sixty percent and it was down under Hillary we didn't prioritize that we didn't care about that as much and now all we talked about is money to go after the Trump voters and yes of course I do think if we stood for anything we actually stood for things and had those values and had populist values I think those voters would come to us but there's something in our psyche that says a legitimate party goes after those voters and doesn't it doesn't proudly stand with the diversify of this country and what this country actually and I'm Simone why don't really brilliantly pointed out african-american voters also want to be able to have a job and provide for their families look several points one you're absolutely right about gay marriage I was there I dealt with it and people privately would say this is ridiculous of course I'd like to be for it but it was being used as a wedge issue and it was used brilliantly by the Bush campaign in 2004 as a wedge issue and it's probably why they carried Ohio so politicians are kind of dealing with some of these realities when they do this number two and maybe this will make me unpopular I want to say something in defense of both Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi when when when Voldemort first when Voldemort first first proposed his health care plan you could have made a lot of money betting at Ladbrokes that there were going to be one or two Democratic defectors and Chuck Schumer held that caucus together Amy knows more about it and and second I do think there are sexism in American politics and I think a huge amount of it has been directed at Nancy Pelosi if if we win the house next year and god I hope we do a huge part of the credit will go to her and a lot of people who are members of the House and candidates would tell you that she did after all lead the party in 2006 when we did take back the house number three I totally agree with the idea that it is completely condescending to assume that the weight phrase working-class means white people black working class people and white working-class people have the same needs and the same anxieties that's why in your state in Kentucky there were all these people who had voted for Voldemort who suddenly said wait a minute he's going to try and take away my health insurance and who got very very upset by it however we do have to get back those white working-class people as well as black working-class people at least in the near term you if you're talking about 15 years from now you won't need them now as a moral matter I think we should speak for them because they do have these needs and they have been treated unfairly there's a county in Wisconsin called Pepin County now don't ask me why there's a County in Wisconsin maybe Amy knows because I think at borders Minnesota named after Charlemagne's father but but that County voted Democratic in every single election since 1972 and almost voted for George McGovern it was carried by Donald excuse me by the Don by by 24 points now I think and that leads me to my last point I think that there is an alchemy a chemistry in American politics where messengers connect or they don't connect people wrote Bernie Sanders off 1% gonna go nowhere and boy did he connect with people from the very first time he stood on the shores of Lake Champlain and announced his candidacy he connected and and it's it's not it's not in my view about where you're from or how much money you have I mean Franklin Roosevelt connected John F Kennedy connected they both came from the establishment but people outside the establishment thought and believed that they cared about them I think our failure in 2016 was to convey the idea that we cared about these people and I think in 2020 we have to make sure and in 2018 for that matter that people understand that we're caring about them and that we're fighting for them if we do that we'll win Center today the top three most common jobs in the nation are retail sales clerk cashier and fast-food worker all of which are low-paying precarious jobs and all of which are in danger of being automated if not out of existence significantly reduced we already have a low wage job crisis in this country we are facing a jobless crisis in this country what sorts of ideas are you and your colleagues thinking about to address what is a massive economic transformation on the level of the Industrial Revolution Thanks number one increasing the minimum wage and increasing in a big way it has not been increased on the federal level since I came into the Senate since the very beginning it's an outrage number two we have to make sure that as we see this change coming to the economy with driverless cars and everything that we are training the workers not only for the jobs that we're going to see in the future but the jobs we have now part of this is acknowledging that not everyone wants to get a four-year degree right away my sister my sister didn't graduate from high school she got a GED she went worked at a factory for a while she then went and got a two-year degree at a community college and then went on there and got an account degree that was her story and it took a decade and seeing these different paths it's really important and if we're gonna bring up the graduation rate my state we have a huge achievement gap between african-american students and white students in our schools it's an outrage we have to start looking at every available job many of which pay well and make sure we're helping these kids to get into these jobs we have not been doing well at that immigration reform you might think well that doesn't sound like an answer when you know you've got these kids that don't have jobs now but when you look at the economy as a whole our economy has been stronger because of immigrants right I stand on the shoulders of immigrants I my grandparents were Slovenian and by the way one of my lowest moments of the year was I was displaced as the most famous Slovenian American by Melania Trump it's true she was actually born an hour away from my relatives every time I look at her it's like looking in the mirror but so this idea of immigration reform when you look at it with 25 percent of our u.s. Nobel laureates were born in other countries right this is ideas that came from people who were born in other lands 70 of our fortune 500 companies are headed up by immigrants so this idea that that's somehow going to hurt our country it has helped our country economically so that is a piece of it as well as you look at new ideas and if we're gonna get forward as a country so I think so much of this has been that we've been set in our old ways of looking at things as the world is changing around us and we are going to have to make the case and I just want to echo what Bob said here it's very easy to be against people when they're in charge but in this last week you saw something that I don't think anyone thought could have happened we thought we were basically dead on arrival with that healthcare bail and we held our party together in the United States Senate from Joe Manchin from Joe Manchin who stood up for the people of West Virginia and said that they deserve Medicaid right to Bernie Sanders and we did that and we never wavered and when you have that kind of unity on a common principle it gets contagious and while a lot of the focus has been on John McCain and when he walked into that chamber and made that vote and let's not forget the two other women do you think do you think do you think they would ever have been there if it wasn't for us leading the way and it wasn't for all of you getting out and going to those marches from day two no way so I just I refuse to write an obituary today okay but we have been through a resounding defeat in the last election there is no doubt about that but we have a way forward and we are walking it right now we still have a Democratic Attorney General our Democratic Secretary of State Alison lundergan Grimes is here this weekend we still have Democrats who represent coal country in East Kentucky so Democrats can win in these places we cannot give up on them let's go ahead and get the first question here um so I feel one of the problems is we're still defining America according to the 50s and 60s definition of Norman Rockwell you know Juna Ward Cleaver that you know when yet when most women are running their own households now we're still defining a family as this you know really kind of a nuclear aspect of you know again though the the Stepford wife you know and and the man is coming home and being you know you know so this is one of the issues that's going on so how do you all how are you are really connecting when you're thinking in terms of the fact of you know like the young lady said here that you know most women are out here running their own households whether you know they're young women or their their their middle age or even older women where the WIA dollars of the Workforce Investment action federal job training programs that are actually helping to make people sustainable within their communities those are those dollars and those money choose to go into black communities when there were black communities and so where are those dollars nowadays when given the fact here even in here in LA County the number one demographic of women who are living in ending up homeless year after year decade after decade are black women middle-aged single and elderly black women thank you well I mean where the federal workforce dollars I think we need to ask our members of Congress I mean I think that there are things that are being done so I want to be clear like I've been a Democrat since I've been able to like register to vote I have worked for Democrats I've worked 15 different campaigns including one presidential like I believe in building up and working for Democrats and working on behalf of the party um I I just think we need to be a little bit more vocal and clear about the things that it is that it is that we want from our elected officials and y'all might be like its own that its own the onus that the elected officials but I also think it's on the onus of these communities because when we showed up for healthcare and said we do not want you to take our health care we do not want X Y & Z the reason Medicare for all so popular Nausicaa people like folks in this room are so vocal about saying that's what they want and so part of it is I think we need to show up and say those are things that we want and on the onus of our elected officials I think it's their job to also educate themselves about things outside of the mainstream thinks they can't be doing for various communities to really close the gaps so only half by that because when we do let the Nancy Pelosi and Dianne Feinstein and all these people know we're for Medicare for all they go just hush up already right they don't want to hear it they don't want to hear it so it's not like it's unclear it's not like the polling is unclear it's not like the town halls are unclear they don't want to hear it so I think the onus is way more on them it is on us and two I think the onus is way more on Baltimore and on the Republicans in the Senate no the Republicans in the house and let me tell you something they're too busy saving Obamacare right now to fight for single-payer the day will come when people will fight for single-payer I think it is very unfair to because they didn't want to make their case wait wait wait wait let's stop pretending stop let's stop pretending as though that are our establishment entities across America have always just done what's right on their own like we would still be sitting at segregated lunch counters if it weren't for people who push ourselves where it's decent move and so I well I hear your frustration and you know look I think that there is a place for Medicare for all absolutely there is a place for single-payer I don't understand why we just okay so but I think people should continue to push for it but it is it is not crazy to say that people are just continuing to stand up and folks aren't listening you have to continue to demand at some point they're gonna have to listen to you let me get senator Klobuchar in here I want to get senator Klobuchar in here because we have one of these theoretical folks that you're talking about to be right here on stage and she may not be able to yell quite as like a yell fest not gonna be good for anyone okay dude among your colleagues okay so their first their first obligation is the people that they represent which is the people this country and what we have seen in the last few months and you can contrast it with Obamacare and the Trump plan in a minute or the Baltimore plan or whatever you're gonna call it but I have never seen anything like it people coming up in parades with a child with Down syndrome saying you know I've always been a Republican but this is my child this is the face for health care in this country last week and I met a pitcher and a catcher 11 years old pitcher diagnosed with juvenile diabetes catcher perfectly healthy and the mom said is this a lottery now are they telling me one of my child will live and one won't live so while we can have the policy debate and I would love to expand Medicare and look at maybe expanding Medicaid and doing that next right now we have an obligation for those of us that are actually on the front line doing the job to protect that picture right to protect those kids and that means making sure that people stay on their insurance till they're 26 years old the kids right it means making sure we don't discriminate against people for pre-existing conditions and it is not a perfect bill I said that the day it passed but we want to make it better and what I'm hoping now is no matter what you see in the tweets no matter what he says that now that vote that night meant one thing that we have to go back and work together to bring down those pharmaceutical prices and if they don't do it we will push them to take votes on it every single day that we must make improvements to this and then we will go on to fight the next fight but to just say that we should just throw it all and not make not make it clear that we have a difference with the Republican Party on that look where the votes lined up on that bill well I think that when you see the concept of going up we will see more and more for first of all the public option within the resistant in the existing thing that would be a smart way to go in these states and to make that the fight Medicare for all but I think the fight right now that's before us that we wouldn't have been able to win without you guys at our back was the fight to save these families from complete economic ruin thank you yes I'm going to address this to senator Klobuchar and mr. Shrum because I think I know where chanc stands on this in 1964 the Republicans had a debacle and Goldwater lost a landslide election and the message that the Republicans took from that is that was never going to happen to them again they built a machine they built a media machine they built it based on a philosophy not a bunch of little things they were going to do it was a simple philosophy government doesn't work and every time they've gotten into power they prove that point but the fact is the fact is that we have not yet done that we keep talking about the edges the Republicans made up their mind not to deal with the middle but to move the middle and they've moved the middle way away from that it was in the 60s now if we're a moderate I ran for Congress if we're a moderate then we are not going to succeed so my question is this if the Republicans were able to believe in a conservative revolution what keeps the democratic party from believing in a progressive revolution rather than elections look forward I believe I believe strongly in a progressive revolution and I would say by the way that since 1964 we have seen enormous progress in these in this country on a number of issues not all issues we have a long way to go but we've seen a lot of progress the history you outline is actually a little more complicated the Republican reaction to the Goldwater defeat was we have to go to some kind of mushy middle and that's what Richard Nixon much as we may not like him that's certainly what he was in domestic policy he signed into law in the Environmental Protection Agency he expected did a deal with Ted Kennedy and George McGovern to expand food stamps massively and it was only in with the coming of Ronald Reagan that the Republican Party became and by the way today Reagan would be a RINO he'd be a Republican in name only they'd throw him out because this was a guy who was for immigration reform yeah this was a guy who did a deal with Tip O'Neill to save Social Security at a deeper level I think you're touching on something very profound the what the Republican Party did not do after the little Nixonian detour what they did not do was abandon the word conservative right in 1960 Richard Nixon used to say you know he was a moderate or a little Republican liberal was a good word it wasn't a bad word and then Democrats got terrified of the word liberal and with some extent terrified of the word progressive and didn't go out and make that fight the one thing I believe right now is that this is a party that will do this and I think we can't look backwards through the lens of 2016 and form a circular firing squad and somehow or other see that as the way that we're going to win I think we're gonna win by standing up for our values I think that what senator Klobuchar is talking about what Democrats are talking about is a way forward it is what I said at the beginning economic justice and social justice and make the Republicans vote on it again and again and again and if we get to single-payer I'd be thrilled but I'd like I think we probably the best way to get there is through the public option to start I'm 16 and I'm afraid I'm really scared that I won't be able to go to college because I'm not gonna be able to afford it what can the Democrats do to help people like me who are afraid that they can't go to college the question was I'm 16 and I'm worried I won't be able to afford to go to college what are Democrats doing to make her college dreams a reality we can't just stay where we are right now and that is why we have proposed with Elizabeth Warren's leadership a bill right that would make college affordable for everyone and that is what we need to be doing we have a situation where we made some changes which were good when President Obama was in to make student loans affordable for students like yourself who are coming in but there are so many students it's right now the number one form of debt for a lot of our seniors is actually student loans because they are either paying for the loans of their kids or their grandkids and so it is reverberating through it yeah I see some hands not of grandparents maybe but it's reverberating through our whole economy so I think that is making it more affordable making the two-year degree an option for and not dissing that degree and giving it the dignity that it deserves that I know in my own family for the one in the two-year degrees looking at the skills that is a 16 year old what kind of advice you're getting in high school we found out that a lot of kids aren't getting the advice about what these loans mean and what your choices are so they go to one school and they get these huge group of loans and then there's no job in the field that they picked you're doing okay you're doing pretty well for yourself now but it's doing a much better remember all the career advice we used to get that's been cut a lot in our education system so it's doing a much better job in high school getting in early to talk to kids about the careers and I love the idea I have a bill with Susan Collins I love that I can name drop her name as a Republican today but on apprenticeships to make it easier for kids when they're in high school to start working at some of these places and it's not just on the factory floor it's all over the place that's what we need to do and and take really a radical change and one thing that hasn't been mentioned is the Democratic governors across the country when we look at leadership and how we can make our case look at the difference between how Minnesota is doing economically under a Democratic governor and Wisconsin under Scott Walker okay there is a clear choice there or look at what's happening what Jerry Brown has done here in California right so that's what I think when we this education issue the answer just doesn't start or end at the federal level it has a lot to do who we put in the governor's office look this is exactly what I'm talking about let's put meat on the bones of that question of how do you make your case here's what you do about your education free college education okay so now not only will Republicans but Democrats will tell me that's unrealistic Oh Jake take the drank tranquilizing drug of gradualism right but the reality is it's 75 billion dollars a year that is you can get twenty years of free college education for every child in America that wants it for one cost of the Iraq war so what they did and what and here's how you win on that issue is that you safe because of your damned war we lost 20 years of the American dream you robbed the American kids and their families of the American dream and we're going to give it back to them okay that's how you make your case that's how you get free college education you don't do it by half-measures I feel like a friggin moderate next to chink but you know here's the challenge in all this it's not all bad or all good right there are things about the current establishment Democratic Party that I like which is obviously why I'm a Democrat and there are things that make me proud to be a Democrat in the policies and proposals they put forward and I and I actually think that a lot of the tensions I'm gonna tag-team with Simone again going back to her previous point a lot of the tensions we're raising are bigger than the Democratic Party alone let's look at free college I happen to prefer you know earned college through community service but but the reason free college is on the map right now let's be clear is largely because of left civil society organizations that put it on the map that 20 years ago weren't talking about that right so it was because of organizations like demos the amazing work of Heather McGee that said let's start talking about that now and Bernie picked it up and the problem be clear he was talking about making public housing diversities tuition free which is different from pre-college I just want to put that out there yes but let's be let's be clear that the the a larger conversation here is about the fact that it hasn't just been the Democratic Party that has huge toward the center but it has been the left that is hewed toward the center and there was a it was a problem of the left that we couldn't get the public we didn't have the more.the mobilizing and organizing muscle to push for the public option the first thing we're gonna happen today and would we would get that's part of what's changed in the selection the other thing we have to be careful about though is I want to go back to the question about you know four out of five American families no longer fit that conventional picket-fence image in America and what we have is this tension where the Republican Party is trying to deconstruct everything we have the Democrats are trying to add bits and pieces all right we've got marriage we've got Social Security let's add gay people to it all right cool you know and and that and that's not the only part of the game there's a third part of the game which is radical transformation which is rethinking how does our economy work how does work work how does College work how's family work 20 30 40 100 years into the future and the left needs to lead that conversation the Democratic Party is never gonna leave the conversation and in my mind the leftist has largely failed to be engaged in a radical transformative conversation that then pushes the rest of the country so Sally I'm gonna wrap up the panel here guys but I want a one-word yes or no answer from everybody on the panel which I know everybody loves 2018 the Democrats take back the house yes or no Sally cone no sorry I just the numbers don't look good at the moment but I don't know man what do you think yes yes we can yes we can Jane with the Justice Democrat unfortunately not with this leadership but 2020 is all ours yes I think we will take it back with this leadership yes
