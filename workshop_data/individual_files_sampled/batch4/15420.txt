an 11 year old Muslim girl in a Toronto suburb claims she was walking to school the other day when she was attacked by a man who came up from behind and tried to cut her head jab off with a pair of scissors the whole national media and then the international media jumped on the story without any skepticism politicians Muslim lobbyists everyone said it was proof of rampant violent Islamophobia except now police say it was a hoax the whole thing was made up the media should have known better but they just love the narrative too much evil racist Canadians picking on a poor Muslim girl they couldn't resist running with that smear it was odd though because as you can see in this photo taken of her that very morning she was wearing a coat with a big winter hood on it so how did her so-called its hacker even see the head jab coming up from behind and how could he get the hood off and then take out a pair of scissors that he just happened to be carrying randomly and then carefully cut the head jab careful enough not to poke the girl and for a long enough period of time to cut a foot of cloth that sounds unbelievable doesn't him and she says she didn't try to run away that's odd she says he ran away and then she went to join some other kids but then she says he came back and tried to do it again but no one else witnessed any of this though other than her little brother and the funny thing is despite being assaulted by a man on a street with a weapon twice this 11-year old girl was cool as a cucumber doing a national televised press conference literally 90 minutes later at her brother - he was there just laughing and smiling through the whole press conference that's weird isn't it this press conference was at the school when was the last time a school just let cameras come in and film children when the criminal was still on the loose perhaps in the neighborhood almost the last time police permitted a child victim of a crime to give a national press conference before the investigation had even started or to even have that child's name and photo published when's the last time a mother whose daughter was just attacked and whose younger son witnessed that attack was not only fine with all this but she seemed to be orchestrating him do you believe that well all the media did it was weird though the police first announced the reported crime at 8:52 a.m. there are a lot of crimes in the big city of Toronto but the media just seemed to know that this one would be newsworthy and the CBC the state broadcaster really seemed to know they had someone write up a story just 45 minutes after the 9-1-1 call that's pretty amazing how did that just happen I mean just to get from the CBC's headquarters downtown to the school itself that's a half hour drive how was it physically possible for the CBC to learn about this crime decide it was important enough to cover dispatch a reporter check the facts write it and publish it in less than 45 minutes isn't that weird oh and then the police went to the school to be part of the press conference with the girl and her brother and her mother how did that just happen who approved that at the police who approved that at the school can I show you a clip here's a clip the state broadcaster the CBC put online I'm gonna show it to you in full for various reasons including the fact that the CBC ran this video despite the CBC's policy of not airing children except for in extreme circumstances especially not airing children who are victims of crimes and the fact that they did so and the CBC was so credulous listen to this clip this morning me and my brother were walking together to school and sadly someone insulted me by cutting my job two times and it's and I felt really scared and confused because I didn't feel comfortable that people are doing this and and this happened one time and then did you scream is that right yes I screamed and and what did the man do the man he just ran away and then is it writing across the street yes we followed this crowd of people to be safe and then did the man come again or was that the last you saw she came again and what happened when you saw him again he um he's he continued putting my hitch up again did he say anything to you um although he had to do of a smile he just smiled and ran away I feel this is not this is terrible and I do not like it and I feel like this should stop I think what you're doing is really wrong you should not act like this and especially I'm a kid and yeah I got a call from the school that was supportive the principal this fall and everyone's been so supportive and yeah so the girls screamed and he ran off and she went to find other kids but he came back apparently a second time and no one else saw him even though she was with the kids now and the man didn't really say anything he was just smiling a bit sort of like her brother there was smiling and laughing at the press conference and that niqab wearing mother oh she loves Canada doesn't she she's just so upset that racists in Canada would do this well she wasn't upset as much as our Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and half the Liberal cabinet who miraculously all knew about this story almost as quickly as the CBC did Trudeau was outraged at Canadians how awful we are as a country how Islamophobic we are we deserved his scolding police had just started their investigation there were no charges laid no suspects no trial no nothing but Trillo knew what he had to do if there's a hijab in the news somewhere Trudeau will be along shortly half of the Liberal cabinet weighed in to Miriam on SEF of course implying the Canadians are all closeted bigots Catherine McKenna of course bizarrely using the child's name what are you doing CNN got in on it too of course so did Iran's state broadcaster Press TV and Canada's main you just kept pumping out the stories especially the CBC which did several stories from different angles they must have had 10 or 20 News tweets on the thing here's one alleged attack on Toronto girl just a tiny glimpse into anti-muslim hate advocate says so this is just the tip of the iceberg people and then the obvious today a press release from the police let me read it to you after a detailed investigation police have determined that the events described in the original news release did not happen the investigation is concluded really so didn't happen the investigations concluded of course there was no Asian man in his 20s with a mustache and glasses like the 11 year old said that was a lie there's a hoax real 11 year olds who were just attacked twice by a man with scissors they don't have press conferences with their laughing younger brother 11 year olds do what they're told though this surely wasn't her idea she was surely put up to it perhaps by her lying hoaxing mother interesting the girl and her brother and their mother all have different last names are they part of a polygamous family that might be a question that a reporter from the CBC might ask one day when they're done being stenographers for Islamic extremists people pushing jabs and the cabs smearing all Canadians as racists the CBC is the racist the family is the racist spreading false accusations of hate crimes they're the ones who are spreading hate they're the ones whipping up divisions amongst us this rancid family and the school board and the politicians and the media who gave them a megaphone for their life I don't want an apology from the 11-year old girl she was obviously just doing what she was told to do which is what children do it's what a lot of women do in Islam though they're told to wear a hijab they're told to wear in the cab and if not they get into trouble I want an apology from the Islam of file politicians and media who are so quick to believe this obvious fake story and smear Canadians I want an apology and an explanation from the school board and the police for permitting this bizarre exploitation of a child for PR purposes but mainly I want the mother charged see the police got the facts right even if it took them a few days to do it but they made an error in their last press release didn't they they said this investigation is concluded well no it's not there is no scissors guy but here's section 141 C of the Criminal Code of Canada let me read it to you it's called public mischief everyone commits public mischief who with intent to mislead causes a peace officer to enter on or continue an investigation by reporting that an offense has been committed when it has not been committed unquote that's what happened here Simas Ahmad that's the mum said an offence had been committed it had not been she misled the world she misled the media she misled politicians she misled the school board that's corrupt that's unethical that's lying that's on Canadian but it is not illegal what is illegal is lying to the cops to get them to start a police investigation she has to be investigated now for this hoax she has to be please sign my petition to the Toronto Police Service it's simple it says we demand the Toronto Police Service investigates Simas amad for misleading police by lying about her daughter being attacked for wearing a hijab that's it you cannot smear a peaceful generous tolerant country like that with your cowardly niqab hiding your face as you do it that's just right it wrong this woman broke the law too though she lied to police she should be charged with it go to a hid jab hoax calm here jab hoax calm and sign the petition we will deliver it to the Toronto Police Service you can't smear Canadians as racist and Ally to the cops not in Canada you can't go to hit jab hoax calm I'm outraged at this insult against Canadians but I'm more outraged at the law breaking sign the petition we need this woman investigated you
