bringing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fascinating interview</font>

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,280
with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> award-winning filmmaker who has</font>

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,190
been shunned by his liberal peers for

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,130
his own open-mindedness<font color="#E5E5E5"> about climate</font>

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:24,180
change last week I went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a film about</font>

of my thing

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,910
and I brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> camera</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the filmmaker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm a</font>

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,020
journalist and that's what I do

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,149
the film is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the uncertainty has</font>

13
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,460

<font color="#E5E5E5">our friends at friends of science and it</font>

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,340
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not your typical climate change</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">troubling happening in the West that</font>

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,409
troubling thing was energy policy we

23
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">face energy poverty in a in a developing</font>

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there was my biggest question fun</font>

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,200
how is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that possible and when I saw the</font>

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,259
debate which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the debate on climate</font>

28
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,130
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is not there and should be</font>

29
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,610
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think here are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we you</font>

30
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,829
know we are also always so good in the

31
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,560
West to say what's wrong in Africa<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,380
saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> something which I didn't experience</font>

33
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">in Africa and it's the lack of democracy</font>

34
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,040
the lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> free freedom of opinions and</font>

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,799
I thought this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the film I want to</font>

36
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,170
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> its an incredible film about what</font>

37
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,450
happens when farmers get more money for

38
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,360
planting wind turbines<font color="#E5E5E5"> and biofuels than</font>

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,000
crops and livestock<font color="#CCCCCC"> the European Council</font>

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,969
has agreed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a climate and energy deal</font>

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:03,960
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sophia</font>

then we call<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sophia</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Potter film the</font>

45

farmer has become energy supplier<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

46
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,280
became the activists

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,580
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what troubled Mariah</font>

48
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,070
more than the climate poverty was the

49
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,800
lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> of debate my biggest reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why I</font>

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,780
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that film is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I saw it</font>

51
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the necessary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> T of a debate which isn't</font>

52
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">there and I think that's that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

53
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,530
biggest thing where we can fight for

54
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that's called democracy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

55
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,560
moment the democracy debate is shutting

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,130
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> Victoria Victoria dictatorship will</font>

57
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,950
replace it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

58
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,360
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that's a very decent scare</font>

59
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,910
to fight for Mariah describes himself as

60
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,760
a liberal but the reaction he received

61
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">from his left-wing friends and</font>

62
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,170
colleagues was shocking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> him I was</font>

63
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,590
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> open very well liberal which means</font>

64
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,050
in my eyes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we should open ourselves</font>

65
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">for different perspectives in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> order to</font>

66
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,250
understand them and from there on

67
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,970
seeking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but what I noticed</font>

68
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,740
is that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did that I received quite</font>

69
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,790
some threats<font color="#E5E5E5"> hate mails phone calls from</font>

70
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">organisations who are calling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me you</font>

71
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it's better to stop screening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

72
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,890
film<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into real trouble</font>

73
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">and what I noticed is among journalists</font>

74
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">I had a decent Network and all these</font>

75
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,400
journalists were kept silent as well

76
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,440
because I send out press<font color="#CCCCCC"> releases to</font>

77
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">these people and you know it remained</font>

78
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,000
silent

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> journalists we should confuse</font>

80
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,150
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's democracy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and now well not</font>

81
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the time of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> climate change is under</font>

82
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,810
pressure due to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rising</font>

83
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">right-wing populism</font>

84
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,349
and I said yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> but when it there is a</font>

85
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:10,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">perspective another perspective</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so what</font>

86
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,110
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> danger and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know get that</font>

87
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">exposure and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then they say that there is</font>

88
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like journalistic</font>

89
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,529
responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's quite scary</font>
