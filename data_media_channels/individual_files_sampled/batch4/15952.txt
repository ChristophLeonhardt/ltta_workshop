in the Department of how low can you go a psychiatrist is seemingly suggesting that Donald Trump is mentally unfit for office just one teeny tiny hitch though she's never actually analyzed the president so dr. bandy Lee would seem to be one hell of a shrink she's edited a nail-biter called the dangerous case of donald trump which includes testimonials from 27 psychiatrists and mental health experts cutting to the chase here's what she told CNN quote lawmakers were saying they have been very concerned about this the president's dangerousness the dangers that his mental instability poses on the nation end quote Wow the president is dangerous this is serious very serious he's the commander in chief after all now you're probably wondering how many sessions Trump had on the couch with dr. Lee in order for her to conclude that Trump is what's the medical term again oh yeah cuckoo for cocoa puffs well actually dr. Lee has never had a consultation with the president not a single solitary session but she nevertheless felt compelled to speak out given recent comments and actions by Donald Trump what comments and actions you asked hey it's Trump any comment or action will do I suppose dr. Lee's acumen for psychiatry is amazing to be sure it's kind of like a mechanic just looking at a car and before it even popping the hood or cranking the ignition he states that the vehicle obviously needs a new alternator now that's one hell of a grease monkey but you know it's one thing for an automotive technician to speculate on what ails a car it's quite another for a psychiatrist to pull off such a stunt with a patient she's never actually seen especially if that patient happens to be the president in fact dr. Lee has actually breached ethical guidelines by doing so the American Psychiatric Association banned psychiatrists from diagnosing patients without a formal examination the APA notes that it's acceptable for a psychiatrist to share their expertise about psychiatric issues in general but member psychiatrists should not give professional opinions about the mental state of someone they have not personally evaluated oopsie how suppose such an esteemed headshrinker like bandy Lee ever forgot that little ethical nugget lifted from psychiatry 101 indeed in a Washington Examiner article thanks to dr. Lee's indiscretions the APA has reminded all of its members that one of its core principles known as the Goldwater rule has been in place since 1973 and states that psychiatrists should not publicly issue medical opinions about people they haven't personally examined in a medical context I think that should be known as the duck rule the Association also noted that if Trump's real-life doctor were to find concerns with his mental health he could refer the president to a psychiatrist but even in that scenario a psychiatrist must abide by patient confidentiality and privacy rules hey did you forget about those silly regs - doctor Lee you know the expectation of confidentiality the right to privacy oh by the way Trump's real-life doctor actually did indeed examine him recently Navy Rear Admiral dr. Ronnie Jackson who served as the presidential decision since 2013 aid the president a clean bill of health and presumably because of the outrageous speculation in certain circles that Trump is losing his marbles dr. Jackson conducted a lengthy and unusual briefing at the White House where he offered a detailed rundown of Trump's latest physical as president oh it should also be noted that part of the exam involved President Trump undergoing tests for cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease sorry to disappoint off the Trump haters out there but the president scored a perfect 30 out of 30 hello now paging dr. Brandi Lee can we have a second opinion from you please from 500 miles away perhaps actually best Lee keeps her medical opinions to herself that's because the American Psychiatric Association notes that quote using psychiatry for political or self and izing purposes is stigmatizing for our patients and negatively impacts our profession end quote gracious is the APA implying that dr. Lee actually didn't forget about our professions ethical standards but rather this was all politically motivated the idea of breaking all those rules if that's the case then hey dr. Lee how does that saying go physician heal thyself for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks if you like that commentary please consider becoming a rebel premium subscriber and never miss another rebel video you
