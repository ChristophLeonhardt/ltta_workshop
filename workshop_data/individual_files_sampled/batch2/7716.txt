we've long suspected that Tommy Lauren was angling for a job at Fox News and the day has come she has been fire hired as a correspondent on Fox News so she will primarily be a contributor for Sean Hannity show though she will also be involved in work on digital products development so she'll be doing some online stuff I will see how she does she also said in an interview just to give you an idea of what kind of person Tommy Lauren is in case you've never been familiar with her in an interview with Playboy earlier this year her most important goal was to help make white people less afraid of offending black people no lofty goal yeah we don't have enough of that right why not start a charity on that the our charity will help you offend other human beings and tear the country apart so earlier this year one of my favorite stories came out and it was about how she was deleting tweets because they didn't necessarily go along with her conservative persona and in those tweets she talked about partying about popping that pussy which is not really what you'd hear from like a goody two-shoes conservative woman who's you know really worried about family values on the other hand at Fox News they might enjoy that kind of talk well maybe yeah you're right now there were a few tweets about this that I thought were funny so I want to share them with you one person writes finally the Blondin also races perspective will also get a voice on Fox which is funny because obviously there's a ton of those voices and then Chris Murphy I love this tweet you can finally get off your parents health insurance tommy Lauren and all you have to do is yell at a camera because she admitted that she is actually using Obama care and on her parent's insurance but to be fair it is hard out there for not only pimps but also for conservative commentators because if you're not on Fox News there's the blaze which is a blaze it's about to go down and it's in financial ruins and and besides which if you deviate from the orthodoxy at all there you're gonna get fired which is kind of what happened Tommy Laurie and then she couldn't find any other job so she had to go work for a propaganda outlet she that'll mean media wise it was literal she went to work at Trump's pack so she was being paid to do propaganda for the Dear Leader that's just literal and then when FoxNews saw that they're like oh you're working for a super PAC to try to you know push people in a certain direction because you're getting paid to do that that's what we do at FoxNews this is the ultimate super PAC for Republicans so they they're bringing her in she's also said that black lives matters is like the Ku Klux Klan black lives matter says hey can you please stop killing us whereas the Klan thought we'd like to kill you so you can see how those two things might be related if you're deeply racist like Tommy Lauren so look this this goes beyond Tommy Lauren I think that Tommy Lauren is a symptom of what I would argue is one of the most frustrating elements of American society we love we love to celebrate and reward bad behavior people who are not rational who are not logical who are not educated and when I say educated I'm gonna talk about a college degree I mean people who talk about issues that they have some knowledge on she never talks about issues she has knowledge on she uses inflammatory language so her videos go viral and she gets rewarded for it and so I think it was a devastating realization for me that sitting there and researching and making sure you know everything and making sure you know what you're talking about and making sure that you don't miss inform people that you give them the information that they need i i've al you that right and i used to think that america valued that america doesn't value that okay Tommy Lauren we were talking about this during the break Tommy Lauren's gonna be fabulously wealthy she will be invited on multiple news or outlets and organizations she will be celebrated every time there's a political convention she's gonna be the headliner and everyone's gonna pick oh my god Tommy Laurie and she is so she's so amazing well why is she amazing can you sit down and have a conversation with her where she actually says one thing that's accurate and not hateful or race-baiting or inflammatory that's the only thing she does but it doesn't matter you know and anytime there's buzz you will get rewarded we actually elected someone based on that and it's so incredibly devastating so all that is fair enough but I actually think that the establishment media has an enormous right-wing bias what I mean by that is if you say ridiculous or hateful things like Anna pointed out and you'll get you will go on cable news over and over again here she is contract from Fox News CNN Oh Jeffrey Lord you know until you say something slightly you put the wrong words together but until you said the magic wrong words you could say hateful things you can say racist things you can say lie after lie after lie it doesn't matter if you're a right winger you can insult CNN to their face you can say their fake news you can say anything you want about them and CNN will have you back on back on back on they'll have an army of right wing lunatics on but if you're a left winger no no no no no you know why because they've internalized the right wing talking point that they're the liberal media so they think we don't need a liberal on we have Chris Cuomo right you're so right and also another story that was in the headlines today was in regard to megyn kelly and how the network she's working for now is in a panic because her audience is much older than they were like oh I know the average age of the Fox News audience is 68 years old that's a fact right so it's just funny to me because people in the media keep drinking that conservative kool-aid regardless of you know their lack of facts their lack of everything that you need to actually be an authority to speak on something right they've completely ignored that because they're they're all about the buzz they're all about promoting these crazy people and then when the audience isn't there they're in a panic wakey-wakey if you're a left-wing you have to be establishment in order to be on TV you have to say the Democratic Party is awesome you have to you know there's a certain things that you have to be very calm you cannot count attack the right do not speak out against the right forcefully otherwise you'll be removed from TV but if you're the right way you say anything you want there are no rules okay so have at it Hoss so the it's there's almost no Bernie Sanders supporters on TV there's a couple of guys that are good guys very tiny and then there's some who are fake Bernie Sanders supporters who actually support the establishment but overwhelmingly it's Democratic Party hacks and the right-wing anything outside of the Hillary Clinton line there's like one or two people in all of television so no the the media hates the left-wing and and they don't allow the left-wing on but Tommy Lawrence of the world will get contracts to the end of time that's right because the mainstream media has an enormous right-wing bias and if you told them that no way no way Rush Limbaugh's been accusing me of being left-wing for 40 years no you internalized that crap and you actually you where it was shit Bernie Sanders the most popular politician in the country shouldn't there be an army of Bernie Sanders supporters on TV and they'd be hard-pressed to point to - on all of television helped us build independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network calm /join
