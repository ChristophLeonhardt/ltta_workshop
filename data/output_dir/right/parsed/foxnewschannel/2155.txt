THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.
>> Neil: HE'S NOT RED OR BLUE.
HE'S GREEN.
I WANT TO SWITCH GEARS.
IT'S HILLARY CLINTON COMMENTING
ON WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 2016
ELECTION.
SHE'S STILL TALKING ABOUT IT.
YOUR REACTION TO THIS.
>> CAN'T BLAME HER.
>> THE IOWA CAUCUSES AND 41% OF
DEMOCRATS ARE SOCIALISTS, AND
I'M ASKED ARE YOU A CAPITALIST
AND I SAY YES WITH APPROPRIATE
ACCOUNTABILITY.
THAT PROBABLY GETS LOST IN THE
OH, MY GOSH, SHE'S A CAPITALIST.
>> Neil: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF
THAT?
>> I THINK SHE'S STILL TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT WENT WRONG, WHAT
HAPPENED.
>> Neil: DO YOU THINK SHE'S A
CAPITALIST?
>> SURE.
SHE SUPPORTS THE SYSTEM.
SHE BELIEVES IN CAPITALISM.
>> Neil: SHE AND HER HUSBAND ARE
VERY RICH.
ARE YOU A CAPITALIST?
>> I BELIEVE IN CAPITALISM.
SHE LOST THE BERNIE SANDERS
VOTERS BECAUSE HE'S A SOCIALIST.
THAT IS A KEY PHRASE THAT WOULD
HAVE WON NEW HAMPSHIRE, WOULD
HAVE HELPED HER WITH THE YOUNGER
VOTERS THAT THINK CAPITALISM IS
A BAD WORD.
>> Neil: SHE MIGHT BE RIGHT ON
THAT.
POLITICALLY, ESPECIALLY IN THE
GO-ROUND IN THIS NEXT ELECTION.
YOU CAN MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT
EVEN BREATHING THAT WORD IS NOT
ACCEPTABLE.
>> IT'S TRUE.
A CAPITALIST DID BECOME
PRESIDENT.
SHE WAS EVENTUALLY THE NOMINEE
IN THE PRIMARY.
IT WAS ABOUT HER ASSUMING THAT
SHE WOULD BE ELEVATED TO THE
PRESIDENCY INSTEAD OF WORKING
HARD FOR IT, WHICH IS A TENANT
OF CAPITALISM.
>> Neil: THE RAP ABOUT
DEMOCRATS, THEY DON'T LIKE
CAPITALISM.
THEY THINK COMPANIES ARE GETTING
AWAY WITH MURDER.
THAT THEY DON'T HELP OUT THE
WORKERS.
>> YOU MEAN CORPORATIONS.
WHICH GOES BACK TO SEATTLE.
SO YOU WOULD THINK THAT AMAZON
WOULD WANT TO DO THE RIGHT
THING --
>> Neil: BUT DO YOU HAVE THE
VIEW OF CEOs --
>> NO, NOT IF THEY DO THE RIGHT
THING.
>> Neil: WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION
OF THE RIGHT THING?
>> WHAT HILLARY SAID IN AN
INTERVIEW, PEOPLE BELIEVE
THERE'S SUCH INEQUALITY.
THE BOSSES ARE GETTING THE MONEY
AND THERE'S WAGE INEQUALITY WITH
WOMEN AND MEN THAT CAPITOLISM IS
LOOKING SO BAD --
>> Neil: AND IT'S TO THE
GOVERNMENT TO FORCE AND FAIR AND
NARROW THAT GAME.
>> SHE SAID THE WAY BERNIE
SANDERS EXPLAINS THE SOCIALISM
IN THE FREE UNIVERSITIES AND
DOING THE RIGHT THING --
>> Neil: SO IF YOU EARN TOO
MUCH, YOU WOULDN'T MIND SOMEONE
IN THE GOVERNMENT SAYING NO, NO,
I'D GIVE IT BACK.
>> GIVING BACK AS A COMPANY.
>> Neil: YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL,
YOU'RE TOO WEALTHY.
>> I BELIEVE WE HAVE ENOUGH
TAXES ALREADY.
THEY SHOULD BE ALLOCATED
APPROPRIATELY.
WE HAVE ENOUGH TAXES TO GO
AROUND.
>> Neil: WHAT IS A GOOD
ACCEPTABLE RATE YOU THINK THE
RICH SHOULD PAY?
>> WE HAVE ENOUGH --
>> Neil: I KNOW WHAT YOU SAID.
YOU OBVIOUSLY FEEL THAT PEOPLE
LIKE CHARLES DON'T PAY ENOUGH.
>> YOU TOLD ME IN THE GREEN
ROOM --
>> I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD PAY
MORE.
SO I --
>> Neil: THAT'S THE BATTLE
ROYALE IN THE NEXT ELECTION YET
AGAIN.
>> IT WILL BE.
THE NOTION OF -- LISTEN, WE KNOW
THERE'S LARGE CORPORATIONS THAT
SHOOT THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT.
POOR BOARDS OF DIRECTORS THAT
PAY -- GE.
JEFF IMMELT.
LIKE WHAT HE DID TO THAT COMPANY
AND THE STOCK.
HE MADE A LOT OF MONEY.
YOU CAN SEE THERE'S LEGITIMATE
ANGER.
THEY'RE PRIVATE ENTITIES.
IF THEY WANT TO RUIN THEMSELVES
BY REWARDING BAD BEHAVIOR --
>> SHOULD BE GOOD BEHAVIOR.
>> Neil: AND IT WOULD BE LIKE ME
OFFERING YOU DIETARY ADVICE.
I WOULDN'T.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Neil: THE GOVERNMENT OFFERING
ANYBODY FINANCIAL ADVICE IS A
SLIPPERY SLOPE.
>> YEAH.
THE GOVERNMENT KNOW WHAT'S
THEY'RE DOING, DON'T
