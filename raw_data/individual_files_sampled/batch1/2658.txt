welcome to TV I live Leonard with us today Scott Walker co-founder and president of brain candy first of all what is brain candy brain candy is a company that has developed a model to help entertainment commercial property owners figure out ways to better monetize and market their properties it does it in a way that opens up the property to a collaborative process where fans and the creative community at large could come in and meaningfully participate in co-creating value and content under that particular property now your company talks a lot about transmedia what is transmedia what did that word mean that would depend on who you ask technically the term was coined by dr. Henry Jenkins who was currently a professor at USC School of Communication hannover School of Communication and he coined the term years ago to refer to that the act of creating multiple narratives across multiple mediums that contributes you the story as a whole so you would have storylines and characters across comic books for example novels movies etc all within the same world but contributing to that world narrative in a meaningful way so if I'm a studio or even a writer opening up my content to other people is kind of scary I mean what are the extensions where this model is going to work in that framework it can be applied several ways one would be for example to take a dormant piece of intellectual property that has been sitting around for 10 or 15 years it's not being worked on its not being monetized actively and friends friends for example or a 1980s TV show or say the buck rogers franchise for example where that's currently going through a reboot process and say we're going to open this up to an install customer base because there are already fans out there who love the property but want to participate in a way that goes beyond passive consumption so what we do is say we can work with the entertainment property owner and say open it up this way here's the strategy allow them to play with it this way that way don't let them play with it this way that way that way you retain editorial and brandy control and yet the creative community has a very flexible way to engage collaboratively and meaningfully with the property they're basically co-creating valium console with the owner and that's key so it's engaging the user that's already there correct and then they will there will be revenue as down the line we monetize that aggregated audience absolutely so the property owner could look at it from pure marketing perspective and say it's going to be a cost Center and they can open it up and say well let you post your content here however the property owner could also monetize it and say here's all this content that's coming in or it's already being generated by the user community around our property let's find a way to integrate that and constructively put that into the property either as official can and content and or as a way to monetize it so that both the creator of the content and the property owner can monetize that content and creative and when you see cannon content that's content that's recognized by the IP owner as official as a panel as opposed to something that is generated within the world but they deem not part of the property gotcha so what's next for brain candy what do you see down the line in the next 5-10 years obviously this is sort of a revolutionary new way to think about how to aggregate audiences and monetize that and where is this going down the line well one thing for sure is that we want to continue to get the word out about the fact that new models of collaboration are going to allow current property owners to find new ways to make money as well as advertised their property user-generated content is just increasing at an exponential rate and with users having far more choices about what to consume where to consume it what properties want to do is be able to get their property out in front and one way to do that in to gain attention is to allow the fans to play with the property in a way that doesn't sacrifice editorial control and doesn't sacrifice commercial rights for the property owner great thanks guy thank you
