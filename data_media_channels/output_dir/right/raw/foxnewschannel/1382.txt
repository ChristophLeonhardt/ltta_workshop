1
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,181
STEVE: WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE.

2
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:12,284
THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN THEY

3
00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:14,420
FOUGHT FOR WOMEN'S LIBERATION

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,556
AND THE EXPLOSION OF CREATIVITY

5
00:00:17,556 --> 00:00:18,991
AND MUSIC.

6
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:23,529
IT WAS UNDENIABLY A POWERFUL AND

7
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:26,098
HEARTFELT EXPRESSION OF FREEDOM.

8
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:27,866
THOSE REVOLUTIONS WERE DRIVEN BY

9
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:29,101
YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEY WERE ON

10
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:29,802
THE LEFT.

11
00:00:29,802 --> 00:00:32,537
LOOK WHERE THE LEFT IS TODAY.

12
00:00:32,537 --> 00:00:33,972
INSTEAD OF FREEDOM THEY STAND

13
00:00:33,972 --> 00:00:34,773
FOR CONTROL.

14
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:39,611
THEY ARE THE NEW PURITANS

15
00:00:39,611 --> 00:00:41,947
MARCHING AROUND AND TELLING THEM

16
00:00:41,947 --> 00:00:50,289
HOW THEY BEHAVE.

17
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:54,960
YOU SEXISM OR RACISM OR TRANCE

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,294
PHOBIA.

19
00:00:55,294 --> 00:00:56,995
OF COURSE THEY ARE WRONG.

20
00:00:56,995 --> 00:01:00,032
THE WAY YOU FIGHT THOSE THINGS

21
00:01:00,032 --> 00:01:01,533
IS THROUGH ACTIVISM.

22
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:03,969
NOT THE BRAIN DEAD MIND CONTROL

23
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:05,904
FACT

24
00:01:05,904 --> 00:01:09,141
TACTICS OF THE NEW PURITAN ON

25
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:11,477
THE LEFT.

26
00:01:11,477 --> 00:01:13,879
THEY TELL YOU WHAT YOU ARE

27
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,514
ALLOWED TO DO AND SAY.

28
00:01:15,514 --> 00:01:22,254
IF YOU TRANSGRESS YOU ARE

29
00:01:22,254 --> 00:01:22,588
SHAMED.

30
00:01:22,588 --> 00:01:24,123
THEY TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY AND

31
00:01:24,123 --> 00:01:25,824
CRUSH THE MOST IMPORTANT

32
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:27,159
DIVERSITY OF ALL.

33
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,461
THE DIVERSITY THAT'S THE

34
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:31,864
FOUNDATION OF HUMAN PROGRESS.

35
00:01:31,864 --> 00:01:36,435
THE DECIDE

36
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:36,468
THE DIVIDE

37
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:36,502
THE DIVERE

38
00:01:36,502 --> 00:01:37,803
THE DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT.

39
00:01:37,803 --> 00:01:42,407
THERE IS NO THOUGHT BUT

40
00:01:42,407 --> 00:01:42,808
CONFORMITY.

41
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:50,282
THEY IMPOSED THEIR NARROW

42
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:50,682
MINDEDNESS.

43
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:52,718
THEY ARE TAKING OVER THE

44
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:55,053
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

45
00:01:55,053 --> 00:01:56,855
THEY WILL PROBABLY NOMINATE ONE

46
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:59,658
OF THEIR OWN AS THE PRESIDENTIAL

47
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:05,130
CANDIDATE AND DESERVETIVELY

48
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:05,430
LOSE.

49
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,566
THEY WILL NOT WIN BECAUSE THEY

50
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:08,967
HEAT

51
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:09,001
HAAT

52
00:02:11,537 --> 00:02:12,838
YOUNG PEOPLE HATE BEING TOLD

53
00:02:12,838 --> 00:02:14,740
WHAT TO DO.

54
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,010
THERE WILL BE A REVOLT.

55
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,313
SO, WHILE THE DEMOCRATS MIGHT

56
00:02:21,313 --> 00:02:23,448
THINK THEIR PURITAN TAKER IS

57
00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:25,284
GOOD POLITICS TODAY BUT THEY

58
00:02:25,284 --> 00:02:28,287
WILL COME BACK AND PIET

59
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:28,320
WILL COME BACK AND BIET

60
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,353
WILL COME BACK AND BITT

61
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:29,221
WILL COME BACK AND BITE THEM IN

62
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:30,122
THE END.

63
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:32,558
IT'S DEEP AND STRONG AND

64
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:32,925
HEARTFELT.

65
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:41,333
THE LEFT CARRIES ON WITH

66
00:02:41,333 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S A
