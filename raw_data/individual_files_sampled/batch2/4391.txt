talking money power politics President Trump is facing big new scrutiny this morning over his finances the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance says it is now quote vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of Investigation following big allegations the president used legally dubious tax schemes back in the 90s to increase the fortune left to him by his parents the details are outlined in a new in-depth report by the New York Times based on 100,000 pages of financial documents including confidential tax returns from trumps father and his companies it is important to note NBC News has not confirmed the allegations in this report the time says quote much of the money came to Trump because he helped his parents dodge taxes in the 90s he and his siblings set up a sham corporation to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their mom and dad records and interviews show records indicate that Trump helped his father take improper tax deductions worth millions more quote he also helped formulate a strategy to undervalue his parents real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars juicing the tax bill when those properties were transferred to him and his siblings in all the president's parents transferred more than 1 billion dollars to their children according to the New York Times that should have produced a tax bill of at least five hundred and fifty million dollars based on a 55 percent tax on gifts and inheritance at the time instead the kids paid fifty two point two million that's about five percent an attorney for the president released the following statement quote the New York Times allegations of fraud and tax evasions are 100% false and highly defamatory there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which The Times basis it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate all estate matters were handled by licensed attorneys licensed CPAs and licensed real estate appraisers who followed all laws and rules strictly the president's brother Robert Trump said quote all appropriate gift and estate tax returns were filed and the required taxes were paid White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also disputed the article and called the report a quote attack against the Trump family joining me now MSNBC contributor and executive editor of Bloomberg opinion Tim O'Brien along with Mark Thompson and Brett Stevens I'm just going to point out this if Donald Trump which he was gifted a massive New York City real estate portfolio all he needed to do was sit on it and he would be worth a cool ten billion bucks at least today instead were mired in this walk Custer you were actually named checked in this article what's your reaction I you know he doesn't sit out anything so he certainly wasn't gonna sit on a pile of money that his dad gave him so that you know it's a youthful notion to safety had just been a patient methodical person and a smart investor he would now have billions of dollars that he doesn't have didn't have to be smart enough chicken just say that's right put it in the next fund but that's not who he is and I think one of the other larger truths in the piece is that he wouldn't be who he is but for his father's support and his father's money the notion that that Donald Trump invented himself out of dust into a prominent Manhattan real estate developer who did it all on his own doesn't really hold water he was a great marketer and he was a great self promoter but from the moment he entered the Manhattan real estate market until his companies went bankrupt his father was at his side always with massive loans then this New York Times piece what is it 13,000 words does it square with your reporting over the years yeah you know at one point you know I had reporting that went Donald's about to go personally bankrupt in the early 1990s he asked his siblings for 30 million dollars in loans which he denied he said that never happened I give you my word but at my reporting was really clean I went with it he actually sued me in part because of that reporting and during a litigation we had the documents that we presented with him that showed yes indeed he had borrowed money from the siblings the number I had was about thirty million dollars the time says it's around sixty there's no doubt he borrowed a lot of money from his father to keep himself afloat and not just not just as a you know opportunistically he would be out of business but for Fred Trump Donald Trump had a near-death experience with debt in the early nineties not a corporate bankruptcy only but a personal bankruptcy and had had Fred's money not been there the Donald Trump story would have stopped in about 1992 well let's share what Donald Trump well then candidate back in 2015 said my father gave me a small loan of a million dollars yeah so that's just a lot of a million dollars what do you think this does to Donald Trump's narrative because again 35 percent of the population think this guy's a business god you know for the longest time whenever I encountered Trump supporters one of the lines I keep hearing is yeah but he's a very successful businessman and that's the kind of CEO that we need in America he's a very successful branding and marketing guy and that's why I'm not quite sure about that even look this article tells us I'm not quite sure and we're gonna have to look very carefully about where the line between tax evasion starts and tax avoidance ends and I think that's that's really something for investigators to pick up with this piece but what this piece tells us and sort of fleshes out in this extraordinary detail is that Donald Trump is a classic American grifter leaving one failure behind time and again and managing to persuade the next group of suckers that he's a credible and successful successful businessman we all kind of knew that but we've I don't think we've ever seen it spelled out in quite this extraordinary I didn't know that we all in New York yet or around the table but across the country people didn't people fell in love with Donald Trump when they watched him on The Apprentice as that big prior The Apprentice use the punchline of four jokes about the excesses of the 1980s and and The Apprentice repositioned him as this entrepreneurial guru and it was all as as Brett was saying it was a complete Hall of Mirrors this guy has been what running the longest con in US history he is the most successful con man in US history why Brett I say he's a branding and marketing genius mark they write about trumps castle casino and say we're an eighteen point four million dollar bond payment was due in December of 1990 Fred Trump dispatched a trusted bookkeeper to Atlantic City with checks to buy three and a half million dollars in casino chips without placing a bet with this ruse and a legal loan under New Jersey gaming laws resulted in a $65,000 civil penalty Donald Trump narrowly avoids defaulting on his bonds how are we supposed to interpret all this because again Donald Trump just goes to a rally and says lock her up those are three words three winning words that that resonates with America and what we're saying is why don't you interpret Donald Trump narrowly not defaulting on bonds he's the greatest show on earth and unfortunately those who follow him have got to be educated as to how he's making a fool out of them his consumers those who buy they're not I think some people hear this story this morning and said wait a minute something isn't right here because he's getting away with everything and the rest of us many of us who support him those who are his supporters they're saying to themselves many of us support him but we're not getting thing out of this deal he gets whatever he wants he avoids any and all scrutiny on this what's interesting though if he had not become president we may not even be having this conversation you know and if he had not become president Paul Manafort wouldn't be in jail everybody's right we stop prosecuting these kind of things years ago and even tax experts who are cited in this report say that the president is not likely to face criminal prosecution and trunk could say you know what I'm a loose hole guy I figured it out it shows how clever I am don't you want a clever president I mean a lot of the vehicles he used a lot of affluent people use gratz or GRA T's are not an uncommon way that people try to protect inheritances or gifts to their kids that there's nothing illegal about those and that was clearly one of the main things they used a lot of the other stuff were they were I think at best do BS and possibly illegal where they were low-balling the valuation on buildings and lying about the value of different holdings that they were transferring around those are really old it's going to be very hard for any tax investigator including New York State investigators to make a legal case out of that I don't think it'll be any criminal charges there might be a civil penalty he knows he's getting away with that he would have continued to if he would not so egomaniacal as to have the need to be President of the United States but this this is a great contribution to the historical indictment of the Donnell oh yes it is hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want
