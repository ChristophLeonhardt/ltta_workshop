>> Bill: DIANNE FEINSTEIN, THE
RANKING MEMBER.
LET'S DROP IN NOW.
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE BACK IN
ACTION TODAY.
NINE: 40:00 A.M.
>> WE DID HAVE SOME MOTIONS FOR.
IF YOU REMEMBER, I SAID THAT I
WILL GIVE THE MINORITY A CHANCE
TO MAKE THEIR MOTIONS.
AND THEN I WAS GOING TO MAKE A
MOTION THAT WE HAVE A TIME
CERTAIN TO GO.
SO I WANT TO MAKE THAT TIME
CERTAIN TO VOTE.
BUT IF THERE IS MOTION FROM A
MINORITY, I WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT
MOTION FIRST.
>> MR. CHAIRMAN.
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO
SUBPOENA MARK JUDGE AS A WITNESS
BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE.
AND I'D BE HAPPY TO SPEAK TO IT.
>> HOLDS JUST A MINUTE.
WOULD YOU -- COULD YOU MAKE YOUR
REMARKS SHORT PLEASE.
SPEAK NOW.
THEN WE WILL VOTE.
PROCEED.
>> YES, MR. CHAIRMAN.
THANK YOU.
WE HEARD YESTERDAY FROM AN
EXTRAORDINARILY COURAGEOUS,
STRONG SURVIVOR, DR. CHRISTINE
BLASEY FORD.
EVERYONE OF US, I THINK, WERE
RIVETED AND POWERFULLY IMPRESSED
BY HER.
WE HEARD HER PROVIDE DETAILS IN
THE STORY THAT CAN BE
CORROBORATED AND OTHER FACTS
THAT CAN BE UNCOVERED IF WE HEAR
FROM OTHER WITNESSES.
WHO HAVE VERY RELEVANT,
IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED.
ON THAT EVENING IN THAT ROOM.
THE THIRD PERSON ALLEGEDLY IN
THE ROOM WAS MARK JUDGE.
EVIDENTLY, HE HAS NEVER BEEN
INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI, HE HAS
NEVER BEEN QUESTIONED BY ANY
MEMBER OF OUR COMMITTEE.
HE HAS NEVER SUBMITTED A
DETAILED ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE
KNOWS.
AND SO, I MOVE THAT WE HAVE HIM
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AS A
WITNESS.
HE COULD BE INTERVIEWED
BEFOREHAND ON A BIPARTISAN
BASIS.
I RECOGNIZE THAT HE HAS
SUBMITTED A CURSORY SIX SENTENCE
LETTER.
NOT EVEN SIGNED BY HIM, IT IS
FROM HIS ATTORNEY.
AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE A
RESPONSIBILITY TO SUBPOENA, AT
THE VERY LEAST, MARK JUDGE,
BEFORE WE MOVED TO VOTE.
IT IS OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO UNCOVER
THE TRUTH AFTER HEARING
YESTERDAY THAT COMPELLING
TESTIMONY FROM DR. BLASEY FORD.
AND WE CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE
VOTE WITHOUT HEARING AT LEAST
FROM MARK JUDGE.
I WOULD SUBMIT WITH ALL DUE
RESPECT, MR. CHAIRMAN, THAT
THERE ARE OTHER WITNESSES WHO
ARE ESSENTIAL FOR US TO HEAR
FROM.
WE SHOULD HEAR FROM THE OTHER
SOUL SURVIVORS WHO HAVE COME
FORWARD WITH CREDIBLE AND
POWERFUL STORIES.
AND THAT'S WILL BE ALSO IN MY
VIEW NECESSARY, BUT TODAY, I AM
MOVING THAT WE SUBPOENA MARK
JUDGE.
>> BEFORE WE VOTE, I WILL READ A
LETTER THAT WE RECEIVED FROM
MARK JUDGE LAST NIGHT.
IT "AS I STATED, I DID NOT ASK
TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS MATTER,
NOR DID ANYONE ASK ME TO BE
INVOLVED.
TOLD THE COMMITTEE THAT I DO
WANT TO COMMENT.
WHEN I TOLD THE COMMITTEE THAT I
DO NOT WANT TO COMMENT ABOUT
THESE EVENTS PUBLICLY, AS A
RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC AND A
CANCER SURVIVOR, I HAVE
STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION AND
ANXIETY.
AS A RESULT, I HAVE FOR SPEAKIN
SPEAKING.
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND I WERE
FRIENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL.
BUT WE HAVE NOT SPOKEN DIRECTLY
IN SEVERAL YEARS.
I DO NOT RECALL THE EVENTS
DESCRIBED BY DR. FORD IN HER
TESTIMONY BEFORE THE U.S. EDITED
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTED TODAY.
I NEVER SAW BRETT ACT IN MANNER
DR. FORD DESCRIBED.
I AM KNOWINGLY SUBMITTING THIS
LETTER UNDER PENALTY OF A FELONY
MARK JUDGE, WITNESS."
AND HE HAS SIGNED IT.
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, MR. CHAIRMAN,
IF I MAY RESPOND ON THE MOTION.
>> YES, ON THE MOTION.
THAT LETTER IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR
AN FBI INTERVIEW.
>> MR. GRAHAM.
>> AND AND KAMALA
HARRIS HAVE SAID THEY WILL
PARTICIPATE IN THIS PART OF
THEIR DUTIES TODAY.
WE ARE GOING TO PAUSE FOR ONE
MOMENT TO LET OUR BROADCAST
STATIONS, OUR FOX NEWS STATIONS
JOIN US.
AND YOU ARE WATCHING THIS
SPECIAL FOX NEWS ALERT, OUR
COVERAGE AS WE AWAIT THE SENATE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE DECISION ON
WHETHER TO RECOMMEND JUDGE BRETT
KAVANAUGH TO THE FULL SENATE FOR
CONFIRMATION VOTE.
I'M HARRIS FAULKNER IN NEW YORK.
THIS IS THE STORY THAT FOR SO
MANY LAWMAKERS ON CAPITOL HILL,
WILL HELP DEFINE WHO THEY ARE.
THEY'VE BEEN TALKING WITH THEIR
CONSTITUENTS THROUGH A PROCESS
OF THE COUNTRY SAW FOR THE VERY
FIRST TIME YESTERDAY.
WE SAW JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH ON
THE HILL TALKING ABOUT
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM MADE BY
A WOMAN BY THE NAME OF
DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD.
WE HEARD FROM BOTH OF THEM IN A
HEARING YESTERDAY AND IT WAS
HEATED AND TODAY WAS HEATED
AGAIN AS PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEIR
VOTE, THEIR CONSTITUENTS AT
HOME, AND ALSO THEIR IMPRESSION
OF THOSE TWO PEOPLE.
LET'S BRING IN CHRIS WALLACE,
HOST OF FOX NEWS SUNDAY NOW TO
TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS.
THIS IS NOT A COURT OF LAW
OBVIOUSLY, THIS WAS IMPRESSION
GATHERING FOR WHAT SOME HAVE
DESCRIBED AS A JOB INTERVIEW.
SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY CALLED IT
AN INTERGALACTIC FREAK SHOW.
>> HE DOES HAVE A GIFT FOR
PHRASES CAN, HARRIS, AND GOOD
AFTERNOON TO YOU.
IT APPEARED THAT THE NOMINATION
OF BRETT KAVANAUGH TO THE
SUPREME COURT WAS GOING TO PASS
OUT OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
ON A STRAIGHT PARTY LINE VOTE,
ALL 11 REPUBLICANS IN FAVOR, ALL
TEN DEMOCRATS AGAINST.
THAT SEEMED TO BE SEALED WHEN
JEFF FLAKE, THE ONE WAVERING
REPUBLICAN INDICATED THIS
MORNING THAT HE WAS GOING TO
SUPPORT JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
HOWEVER, AFTER HE ANNOUNCED
THAT, AND DEMOCRATS WERE VERY
UPSET, A COUPLE OF THEM
LITERALLY WERE ON THE VERGE OF
TEARS.
AFTER THEY HAD THEIR FIRST
MEETING THIS MORNING, A NUMBER
OF THE DEMOCRATS WALKED OUT
WHILE OTHERS WERE MAKING
SPEECHES AND THEY WERE ABLE TO
CORRAL SENATOR FLAKE INTO A SIDE
ROOM THERE IN THE SENATE AND
THEY WERE LOBBYING HIM, HARDER,
TO TRY TO SWITCH HIS VOTE AND
PERSUADE HIM NOT TO VOTE FOR
KAVANAUGH AND FLAKE HAS NOT BEEN
BACK SINCE.
WHAT WE DO EXPECT, AND AS I SAY,
HE MADE A FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT
TODAY THAT HE WAS GOING TO BACK
KAVANAUGH BECAUSE HE SAID WE
HAVE TO FOLLOW THE PRESUMPTION
OF INNOCENCE AND THERE WASN'T
HARD TO PROVE OTHER THAN THE
TESTIMONY OF CHRISTINE BLASEY
FORD THAT THIS EVENT HAPPENED,
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF DOUBT AS
TO WHETHER THE DEMOCRATS WERE
ABLE TO GET HIM TO CHANGE HIS
MIND.
>> Harris: YOU ARE TALKING
ABOUT THE TEARS, I THINK YOU
MEAN SENATOR CHRIS, WHO WATCHED
AND HE WAS ON THE VERGE OF
TEARS.
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENS GOING FORWARD.
THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE THIS VOTE
RIGHT NOW AND WE WILL KNOW IN
JUST A FEW MOMENTS IF IT DOES
SHAKE OUT 11-10 OR SOMEHOW
DIFFERENT THAN THAT, WE WILL
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT JUDGE BRETT
KAVANAUGH WILL BE FULL SENATE
VOTE NEXT WEEK TO BECOME THE
NEXT JUSTICE ON THE
SUPREME COURT.
WHERE DO WE STAND IN WASHINGTON
WITH PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO WORK
THINGS OUT?
BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY, REALLY
NASTY, CHRIS.
>> LET ME TALK FIRST OF ALL
ABOUT THE PROCESS BECAUSE EVEN
IF THEY WERE TO VOTE NOT TO
REFER THE NOMINATION OF BRETT
KAVANAUGH, THAT WOULD NOT STOP
THE SENATE FROM TAKING A VOTE.
IF YOU WERE TO GO DOWN 11-10
RATHER THAN REPORTED OUT
FAVORABLY 11-10, IT CAN STILL BE
BROUGHT TO THE SENATE FLOOR IN
THE WAY THAT WOULD WORK IS THAT
TOMORROW IT WOULD BE BROUGHT UP
AND ON MONDAY THERE WOULD BE A
VOTE TO CUT OFF DEBATE AND THE
CONFIRMATION WOULD HAPPEN ON
TUESDAY.
AS BRET BAIER MENTIONED A FEW
MOMENTS AGO, THERE IS STILL SOME
DOUBT ABOUT TWO MODERATE WOMEN
IN THE SENATE, REPUBLICAN WOMEN,
LISA MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA AND
SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE.
WE DON'T KNOW, THEY HAVE NOT
ANNOUNCED.
SUSAN COLLINS AS OF LATE MORNING
HAS SAID SHE IS STILL UNDECIDED
ON THIS AND I SUSPECT IF WE ARE
NOT GOING TO HAVE US UNTIL
TUESDAY SHE WILL HEAR FROM A LOT
OF CONSTITUENTS BACK HOME IN
MAINE.
AS FAR AS RELATIONS ON
CAPITOL HILL AND BETWEEN THE TWO
PARTIES, YESTERDAY WAS ABOUT AS
UGLY AS I'VE EVER SEEN IT AND
I'VE BEEN IN THIS TOWN FOR 40
YEARS.
YOU'VE SEEN SPIRITED DEBATES,
SOME ANGRY DEBATES, BUT
YESTERDAY WAS UGLY AND BITTER.
AND PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU SAW
LINDSEY GRAHAM SNAP BACK AFTER
THESE ATTACKS BY DEMOCRATS ON
KAVANAUGH WHEN THEY WERE TALKING
ABOUT DRINKING GAMES AND HIS
HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK.
AND HE SAID THIS IS THE MOST
DESPICABLE THING I'VE EVER SEEN
IN THIS TOWN AND ANY REPUBLICAN
WHO VOTES NO VOTES AGAINST THE
NOMINATION IS LEGITIMIZING THAT,
THIS ISN'T JUST PEOPLE PLAYING
ON TV AND THEY GO AS IT OFTEN
HAPPENS, HOPEFULLY SO, YOU CAN
ARGUE ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND GO
OUT AND HAVE A DRINK OR
WHATEVER, I FEEL LIKE THERE IS
SOME REAL ENMITY, SOME REAL
GRUDGES THAT HAVE BEEN FORMED
OVER THESE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.
>> Harris: I HAD ON
SENATOR DAINES A FEW MINUTES AGO
AND HE TALKED ABOUT CALLING
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH AND GIVING
HIS SUPPORT AND SAYING HOW PROUD
HE WAS OF HIM.
WE KNOW THERE BEEN SOME OTHER
TYPES OF PHONE CALLS THAT HAVE
GONE ON IN THIS PROCESS TODAY.
YOU MENTIONED COLLINS AND THE
OTHER WHAT WE WOULD CALL A SWING
VOTER, GETTING CALLS FROM
GEORGE W. BUSH AND CONDOLEEZZA
RICE AND SOME SHORING UP, IF YOU
WILL.
HOW IMPORTANT IS IT FOR US TO
SEE THAT PROCESS PLAY OUT?
SENATORS MURKOWSKI AND COLLINS
THE TYPE THAT WOULD WATCH AND
LISTEN TO THAT OR ARE THEY MORE
FOCUSED ON FROM WHAT WE KNOW
FROM REPORTING, MORE FOCUSED ON
THAT HEARING?
SOME ARE SAYING THEY WERE GOING
TO HOLD OFF ON THEIR BOATS, NOW
WE KNOW HOW JEFF FLAKE WILL VOTE
AFTER THE HEARING.
HE SAID HE WANTED TO HEAR WHAT
BOTH PEOPLE HAD TO SAY.
>> THE ANSWER IS WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO GO INTO THEIR
DECISION-MAKING.
I THINK OBVIOUSLY MOST IMPORTANT
WAS THAT HEARING, THEY BOTH SAID
THEY WERE GOING TO WATCH IT, I
SUSPECT THEY WERE GOING TO
LISTEN TO PEOPLE THEY RESPECT ON
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE.
IT'S INTERESTING THAT PRESIDENT
PRESIDENT BUSH, BUSH 43 IS
TALKING TO THEM, NEITHER OF THEM
HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WHEN
PRESIDENT TRUMP ISSUED A TWEET
LAST WEEKEND SAID LOOK, IF THESE
CHARGES WERE SO SERIOUS, I'M
SURE CHARGES WERE FILED RIGHT
AWAY, HE KNEW NO CHARGES HAD
BEEN FILED.
SUSAN COLLINS SAID SHE WAS
APPALLED BY THAT TWEET.
IT MAY BE THAT SHE WOULDN'T
PARTICULARLY BE PERSUADED BY
PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT SHE MIGHT BE
BY GEORGE W. BUSH.
THESE ARE SENATORS AND THEY ARE
OBVIOUSLY GOING TO LISTEN TO
THEIR CONSTITUENTS.
THIS IS A DEEPLY FELT ISSUE ON
PEOPLE'S MINDS, OBVIOUSLY THE
COUNTRY WAS RIVETED TO THE
TESTIMONY YESTERDAY, ONE ASSUMES
THE VOTERS BACK HOME WE'LL TRY
TO GET IN TOUCH.
>> Harris: I WANT TO TALK TO
WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE SCREEN
RIGHT NOW, WE WERE POSTURED FOR
A VOTE AT 1:30 P.M. EASTERN AND
WE'VE SLID JUST A FEW MINUTES
FROM THAT.
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO SIT BY,
STAY CLOSE, PLEASE.
I WANT TO BRING YOU BACK.
WE ARE SEEING SENATORS TAKE
THEIR SEATS BUT WE ARE SEEING
SOME GATHERING WITHIN THAT ROOM.
IT'S A HEARING ROOM, NOT A
COURTROOM.
WHEN YOU SEE THIS, YOU ARE NOT
GOING TO BE ABLE TO KNOW,
THERE'S NOT ONE SIDE AND THEN
THE OTHER.
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REAP
THE DECISIONS ABOUT A VERY
IMPORTANT MATTER AND HAVE TO
CONSIDER ALL THAT WENT ON THAT
WAS REALLY SALACIOUS AT TIMES
YESTERDAY.
>> WE ARE GETTING INDICATIONS
THAT SENATOR COONS FROM DELAWARE
HAS PULLED SENATOR FLAKE,
SENATOR FLAKE IS GOOD FRIENDS
WITH SENATOR COONS.
THERE MAY BE A CHANGE HERE.
SINCE THAT TIME THEY'VE HAD A
DISCUSSION ON THE SIDE, YOU CAN
KIND OF SEE PEOPLE GATHERED IN
THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.
SENATOR COONS HAS COME BACK INTO
THE COMMITTEE ROOM AND HAS BEEN
WHISPERING TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN,
SENATOR DURBIN.
ABOUT WHAT, WE DON'T KNOW.
ONE OF THE ASSUMPTIONS WAS THAT
DEMOCRATS ARE REALLY PUSHING FOR
THIS DELAY FOR AT LEAST A WEEK
TO LET THE FBI BACK INTO THE
INVESTIGATION.
ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT THAT?
WE DON'T KNOW.
SENATOR FLAKE IS NOW BACK IN THE
ROOM AND NOW THIS VOTE IS SEVEN,
8 MINUTES TILL EIGHT AND
SENATOR GRASSLEY IS PRETTY TIME
ORIENTED WHEN HE SAID 1:30.
>> Harris: LET ME ASK YOU
ABOUT SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR FROM
MINNESOTA, BECAUSE SHE LAID IT
OUT LIKE THE FORMER PROSECUTOR
WE KNOW HER TO BE IN TERMS OF
WHY YOU WOULD WANT THAT FBI
INVESTIGATION TO EVEN HAPPEN
NOW.
AND SPEAKING TO A DELAY.
IF DEMOCRATS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO GET A DELAY, WE SAW
YESTERDAY, WHAT ABOUT YESTERDAY
WOULD AID THEM IN GETTING A
DELAY?
>> Bret: OF THE EMOTIONAL
TESTIMONY OF DR. CHRISTINE BLASE
FOR IT AND HOW SHE PRESENTED
HERSELF AND I THINK WAS TO THEIR
BENEFIT.
OBVIOUSLY THE PROSECUTOR FROM
ARIZONA, MISS MITCHELL KIND OF
METHODICALLY CAUGHT SOME HOLES
IN SOME OF THE THINGS SHE TALKED
ABOUT, WHETHER SHE WAS GOING TO
FLY OR NOT, THE WHOLE PROCESS
ISSUED.
THERE WERE TWO SIDES OF THIS,
ONE IS THE STORY OF WHAT
HAPPENED IN THE EARLY 1980s
AND THE OTHER IS THE PROCESS OF
HOW IT WAS DEALT WITH.
WAS IT DEALT WITH TO GET PAST
THE ELECTION SO DEMOCRATS CAN
HOLD ON TO THE SENATE
SUPREME COURT SEAT AND FIGHT
ANOTHER BATTLE IN DECEMBER?
I THINK REPUBLICANS ARE ARGUING,
YOU HAD A CHANCE TO DEAL WITH
THE FBI, YOU HAD A CHANCE IF
SENATOR FEINSTEIN HAD THIS
LETTER TO BRING US INTO THE
PROCESS, YOU CHOSE NOT TO.
NOW ON THE FINAL HOUR, TO
DELAYED ANOTHER WEEK IS NOT
FAIR.
THE DEMOCRATS COULD'VE
INVESTIGATED WITH THEIR OWN
TEAMS ON THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE, HAD THEIR OWN STAFF
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND THEY
DIDN'T DO IT.
>> Harris: WITH RACHEL
MITCHELL, THE POINT AT THE VERY
END OF ALL HER QUESTIONING
YESTERDAY WITH DR. CHRISTINE
BLASE FORD, WAS IF YOU DID HAVE
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN, IT
WOULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MORE
THAN WHAT SHE FELT AS A
PROSECUTOR SPECIALIZING IN SEX
CRIMES, SHE WAS ABLE TO
ACCOMPLISH YESTERDAY.
AMY KLOBUCHAR USED TO HAVE A
SIMILAR JOB WAS LAYING OUT THE
CASE FOR DEMOCRATS FOR WHY THIS
NEEDS TO GO FORTH JUST A COUPLE
DAYS.
I HEARD THE LANGUAGE OF A WEEK
EVEN BEING A DELAY.
LET'S BRING IN CHRIS WALLACE NO
NOW, AS THIS DELAY IS PLAYING
OUT ON SCREEN, WE ARE 10 MINUTES
BEYOND THAT VOTE, WE KNOW
SENATOR GRASSLEY TO BE A
STICKLER ABOUT TIME, WE SAW HIM
SHORE UP THOSE SOMETIMES LENGTHY
COMMENTS BY DEMOCRATS TODAY,
PARTICULARLY PEOPLE GIVING EACH
OTHER THEIR OWN TIME.
BUT NOW A DELAY.
IN THE VOID OF TIME, IF YOU
WILL, POTENTIALLY YOU ARE SAYING
THERE COULD BE SOME
HORSETRADING.
YOUR THOUGHTS?
>> YES, YOU'RE ASKING WHY THERE
WOULD BE A DELAY OR WHY THEY
WOULD CONSIDER A WEEK DELAY,
THEY WOULDN'T.
EXCEPT FOR ONE REASON, WHICH IS
IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE VOTES.
THEY WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE, ARE
THEY GOING TO PRESS AHEAD WITH
THIS VOTE EVEN IF IT TURNS OUT
UNSUCCESSFULLY IF FLAKE WERE TO
BE DEMANDING THAT AND THEY
WOULDN'T AGREE TO THE FBI
INVESTIGATION, BUT IF THEY GET
WORD, AND I AM JUST SPECULATING
NOW, THAT LISA MURKOWSKI WAS
ALSO WANTING A DELAY OR SUSAN
COLLINS ALSO WANTED THE DELAY,
YOU WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE
DELAY.
IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE 50 VOTES
PLUS THE TIE-BREAKING VOTE OF
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE, THEY MIGHT
HAVE TO DELAY.
I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY OTHER REASON
AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY
REPUBLICANS WOULD BE SO NERVOUS
ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WHAT WE SAW
IN THE LAST WEEK WAS -- WHATEVER
YOU THINK OF THE LEGITIMACY OF
THE ALLEGATION BY CHRISTINE
BLASEY FORD, THE ALLEGATIONS BY
DEBORAH RAMIREZ AT YALE, JULIE
SWETNICK, TALKING ABOUT GANG
RAPE PARTIES SHE CONTINUE TO GO
TO THAT SEEMED TO BE MUCH LESS
CREDIBLE, YOU SAW A NUMBER OF
THESE.
YOU HAVE A WEEK DELAY, WHO KNOWS
WHAT SOMEBODY IS GOING TO SAY.
A DELAY IS THE ENEMY OF THIS
CONFIRMATION AND REPUBLICANS ARE
KEENLY AWARE OF THAT AND THE
ONLY REASON I CAN IMAGINE THAT
THEY WOULD AGREE TO THAT AS IF
SOME OF THE KEY SWING VOTERS
WERE DEMANDING IT.
WE DON'T KNOW IT'S HAPPENING.
>> Harris: I CAN SAY THIS
ABOUT LISA MURKOWSKI AND SUSAN
COLLINS PARTICULARLY BECAUSE
IT'S BEEN REPORTED AND WE HAVE
HEARD DIRECTLY FROM
SENATOR COLLINS THAT SHE WANTED
A SUBPOENA OF THIS MARK JUDGE,
THIS FRIEND OF BRETT KAVANAUGH.
WOULD THAT BE A STICKING POINT
THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT?
WE KNOW HE'S GIVEN AN AFFIDAVIT,
YOU MENTIONED THE THIRD WOMAN
WHO MADE AN ACCUSATION AGAINST
BRETT KAVANAUGH, SHE HAD GIVEN
AN AFFIDAVIT.
ARE THEY HAVE EQUAL WEIGHT OR
COULD YOU SEE A SITUATION WHERE
MARK JUDGE COULD BE SUBPOENAED
AND WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH TO KEEP
THIS THING FLOWING AND WHAT KIND
OF A DELAY THAT WOULD CAUSE?
>> I THINK THAT WOULD BE
UNACCEPTABLE TO REPUBLICANS,
THEY SAY -- THERE WAS A PUSHBACK
FROM DEMOCRATS THAT MARK JUDGE
FILED A STATEMENT THROUGH HIS
ATTORNEY, THEN LAST NIGHT MARK
JUDGE SIGNED AN ACTUAL LETTER
THAT IS, WE SHOULD POINT OUT,
PUNISHABLE BY FELONY IF HE'S
LYING.
IT'S A SMALL ROOM, THIS IS A
SMALL COMMITTEE ROOM.
YOU HAVE NOT ONLY DEMOCRATS
CORNERING FLAKE IN THIS LITTLE
ROOM BUT A LOT OF REPUBLICANS,
INCLUDING NOW SENATOR GRASSLEY
GOING OVER TO THAT ROOM TO FIND
OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.
YOU ARE 13, 14 MINUTES AFTER THE
SCHEDULED VOTE HERE.
ONE THING AND PROCESS THAT CHRIS
MENTIONED BEFORE, IT'S NOT
NECESSARY FOR THE SENATE
JUDICIARY TO VOTE TO RECOMMEND.
THEY DO HAVE TO VOTE, THOUGH.
LIKE THEY DID WITH CLARENCE
THOMAS, THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE COULD COME TO NO
RECOMMENDATION FOR A TAG, OR SAY
WE DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PERSON
TO THE SENATE FLOOR.
IT DOES PREVENT THAT VOTEE FROM
GOING FORWARD THAT MITCH
McCONNELL SAID HE WOULD DO.
IF THEY DON'T RECOMMEND, THAT
OBVIOUSLY SWAYS POTENTIALLY SOME
MODERATE VOTERS WHO HAVEN'T
DECIDED, LIKE COLLINS OR LISA
MURKOWSKI, SOME OTHERS WHO SAID
THEY HAVEN'T DECIDED YET BUT WE
EXPECT THAT THEY WILL BE VOTING
NO.
>> Harris: YOU HEAR THE NAME
ROBERT BORK COME UP AND YOU TALK
ABOUT OUR RECOMMENDATION OUT OF
THAT COMMITTEE.
YOU HEAR THE COMPARISON, DO YOU
SEE ANY COMPARISON?
>> TO THIS EXTENT, IT USED TO BE
THAT THERE WAS A PRESUMPTION
THAT WHEN A PRESIDENT CAME IN,
IF HE WERE TO RECOMMEND SOMEBODY
WHO WAS WITHIN THE JUDICIAL
MAINSTREAM AND QUALIFIED, YES, A
REPUBLICAN WOULD NOMINATE A MORE
CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE AND A
DEMOCRAT WOULD NOMINATE A MORE
LIBERAL JUSTICE, BUT PART OF THE
FRUIT OF THEIR ELECTION WAS IF
THIS WAS SOMEONE IN THE JUDICIAL
MAINSTREAM, THERE WOULD BE
DEFERENCE GIVEN TO THE
PRESIDENT'S CHOICE.
WITH ROBERT BORK NOMINATED BY
RONALD REAGAN, THAT SEEMED TO GO
OUT THE WINDOW.
A DISTINGUISHED MEMBER OF THE
D.C. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS,
IT BECAME EXTREMELY HEATED,
EXTREMELY POLITICAL.
AS SOON AS HE WAS NOMINATED TED
KENNEDY WENT TO THE SENATE FLOOR
AND SAID "IN ROBERT BORK'S
AMERICA WOMEN WILL ONCE AGAIN BE
GETTING BACK ALLEY ABORTIONS."
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU STARTED TO
SEE THE NOMINATION AND
CONFIRMATIONS BECOME EXTREMELY
POLITICAL AND IT'S GONE DOWNHILL
FROM THERE.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECORD,
REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE
LIKELY TO GIVE DEFERENCE TO THE
CHOICE OF DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS
THAN DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN TO GIVE
DEFERENCE TO REPUBLICANS.
>> Harris: SENATOR LINDSEY
GRAHAM MADE THAT POINT AND HE
EVEN SAID, TO THOSE DEMOCRAT
NOMINEES, HELLO.
HE SAID, I VOTED FOR YOU.
WHAT WILL IT LOOK LIKE GOING
FORWARD?
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON
ON THE SCREEN RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE
LOOKING AT THE SAME THING THAT I
AM BECAUSE WE BOTH TOOK OUR
READING GLASSES ON AND OFF.
SENATOR GRASSLEY HAS RETURNED.
>> YES BUT HE'S NOT DONE YET,
EVERY DEMOCRAT IS IN THIS SMALL
ROOM AND THEY ARE HOT BOXING
SENATOR FLAKE, THEY ARE HAVING A
SPIRITED DISCUSSION, SENATOR 
SENATOR COONS LEADING THE WAY.
I POINT OUT, THEIR FRIENDSHIP
AND REAL FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN
SENATOR FLAKE AND SENATOR COONS,
AND IF THERE IS SOMETHING
BREWING ABOUT A DELAY OF SOME
SORT, REMEMBER, FLAKE JUST PUT
OUT A STATEMENT SAYING HE FELT
THAT THE PRESUMPTION OF
INNOCENCE BELONGS TO JUDGE
KAVANAUGH, HE CALLED BOTH
WITNESSES VERY COMPELLING AND
CREDIBLE BUT WITHOUT
CORROBORATION, THE PRESUMPTION
OF INNOCENCE GOES TO JUDGE
KAVANAUGH.
IS SENATOR COONS AS HE DID IN
HIS SPEECH TODAY SAYING OKAY, WE
GET YOU, BUT GIVE US A FEW DAYS
TO INVESTIGATE.
THAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE
BEEN HANGING THEIR HAT ON PRETTY
MUCH ALL YESTERDAY AND ALL TODA
TODAY.
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT SCENARIO
IS ONE, WHAT DO THEY GET?
THEY ALWAYS GO BACK TO MARK
JUDGE AND WHAT IS GOING TO SAY
OR NOT SAY.
HE'S NOW FILED A LETTER HE
SIGNED SAYING HE DOESN'T
REMEMBER ANYTHING LIKE THIS
PARTY, ARE THEY GOING TO GET
SOMETHING MORE?
THE FBI COULD ASK HIM QUESTIONS
THAT PROBE HIM, THAT'S WHAT
DEMOCRATS WANT TO SEE.
THEY ALSO WANT TO SEE OTHER
AVENUES EXPLORED.
THE PROBLEM, AS I SAID, THEY SAT
ON IT.
UP UNTIL THE END OF THIS
PROCESS.
AND NOW IT'S BEING DELAYED AND
THE ARGUMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE
IS THAT DOING SO BY POLITICS.
THERE YOU SEE SENATORS COMING
OUT OF THAT ROOM.
>> Harris: I'VE TAKEN OUT THAT
SENATOR FLAKE STATEMENT SO I CAN
LOOK AT IT AGAIN, "I WISH I
COULD EXPRESS THE CONFIDENCE
THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE
CONVEYED ABOUT WHAT EITHER DID
OR DID NOT HAPPEN IN THE EARLY
1980s.
WHEN I LEFT THAT HEARING
YESTERDAY WITH AS MUCH DOUBT AS
CERTAINTY."
YOU GO ON TO READ WHAT HE SAID
ABOUT THE ABSENCE OF
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE AND
THAT'S WHAT BINDS US TO RULE OF
LAW.
THE LAST SENTENCE OF HIS
STATEMENT FROM TODAY, "JEFF
FLAKE SAYS I WILL VOTE TO
CONFIRM JUDGE KAVANAUGH."
AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE
CACOPHONY IN THE ROOM AMONG
DEMOCRATS THAT THAT SET OFF,
THAT'S CODE FOR YELLING, I WOULD
IMAGINE.
CORY BOOKER WAS REALLY DIFFICULT
TO EVEN WRAP.
>> WE ARE GOING TO TAKE ACTION
OVER THE MOTION THAT'S BEFORE
US.
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE WE
HAVE A QUORUM.
>> AS A POINT OF PERSONAL
PRIVILEGE, I'M GOING TO CALL ON
SENATOR FLAKE TO SPEAK.
NORMALLY WE WOULD START THE VOTE
RIGHT NOW BUT AS A POINT OF
PERSONAL PRIVILEGE I WOULD CALL
ON SENATOR FLAKE.
>> THANK YOU.
I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH A
NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER
SIDE, WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS
ON GOING FOR A WHILE WITH REGARD
TO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO DUE
DILIGENCE HERE.
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE PROPER
TO DELAY THE FLOOR VOTE.
FOR UP TO, BUT NOT MORE THAN ONE
WEEK.
IN ORDER TO LET THE FBI
CONTINUE -- TO DO AN
INVESTIGATION, LIMITED IN TIME
AND SCOPE, THE CURRENT
ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE THERE,
LIMITED IN TIME TO MORE THAN ONE
WEEK.
I WILL VOTE TO ADVANCE THE BILL
TO THE FLOOR WITH THAT
UNDERSTANDING AND I'VE SPOKEN TO
A FEW OTHER MEMBERS WHO ON MY
SIDE OF THE AISLE MAY BE
SUPPORTIVE AS WELL.
THAT'S MY POSITION.
I THINK THAT DOING DUE DILIGENCE
IS IMPORTANT AND I WANT TO SAY
THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS ACTED
PROPERLY.
THE CHAIRMAN HAS BENT OVER
BACKWARDS TO DO INVESTIGATIONS
FROM THIS COMMITTEE.
AND TO DELAY THIS VOTE IN THIS
COMMITTEE FOR A WEEK SO THAT
DR. FORD CAN BE HEARD.
AND SHE WAS YESTERDAY.
SO THAT'S WITHOUT AGREEMENT.
I WILL VOTE TO ADVANCE THE BILL
TO THE FLOOR.
ONE SECOND, CAN DIANE SPEAK?
>> WHAT ARE WE VOTING ON?
WE ARE VOTING ON THE MOTION TO
REPORT THE NOMINATION TO THE
FLOOR.
>> THAT'S NOT MY UNDERSTANDING,
LET THE SENATOR EXPLAIN IT.
>> MY UNDERSTANDING, THE
DEMOCRATS COULD SPEAK TO IT,
CHRIS OR YOU AS WE TALKED ABOUT
BEFORE.
THE DEMOCRATS WOULD ACCEPT AND
ENDORSE ALL ONE WEEK FBI
INVESTIGATION LIMITED IN TIME
AND SCOPE.
>> SINCE YOU ARE THE DECIDING
VOTE HERE, WE WILL VOTE AND IF
THERE'S ANY SORT OF DISCUSSION
WE WILL DO THAT AFTER THE VOTE.
CALL THE ROLE.
>> MR KENNEDY, MR FLAKE, MR.
DURBIN,
.
>> ON THE NOMINEE, NO.
>> NO.
>> MR. BOOKER?
>> NO.
>> MS. HARRIS?
>> NO.
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THE VOTES ARE
11 NAY, 10 YEA.
>> I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR
GIVING US THE TIME TODAY TO HAVE
IT IN A CONVERSATION.
A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE
ASKED FOR A ONE WEEK DELAY IN
ORDER THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN FBI
INVESTIGATION OF WHAT
ALLEGATIONS ARE CURRENTLY BEFORE
THIS COMMITTEE.
I RESPECT SENATOR FLAKE'S VIEW
THAT IN HIS OPINION IT WAS BEST
TO RESPECT YOUR HAVING GIVEN
DR. FORD THE TIME TO BE HEARD
YESTERDAY AND ADVANCE THE
NOMINEE TO THE FLOOR.
BUT IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE COULD
WORK TOGETHER ON A BIPARTISAN
BASIS TO DILIGENTLY PURSUE AN
FBI INVESTIGATION WITHIN THE
NEXT WEEK.
NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF DELAY BUT
FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING
FURTHER EITHER ALLEGATIONS MADE
BY DR. FORD OR OTHERS WITH A
GOAL TOWARDS DEMONSTRATING A
BIPARTISAN COMMITMENT TO
DILIGENTLY INVESTIGATE THESE
ALLEGATIONS.
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.
THANK YOU, SENATOR FLAKE.
>> I WOULD SUPPORT THAT MOTION.
I THINK WE DO NEED THIS
INVESTIGATION.
I SORT OF MISUNDERSTOOD
SENATOR FLAKE WHAT YOU ARE
DOING, I THOUGHT IT INCLUDED A
ONE-WEEK INVESTIGATION.
SO I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THE
MOTION FOR THAT INVESTIGATION.
>> WE WILL TAKE TURNS A YEAR,
SENATOR.
>> I LOVE THIS COMMITTEE BUT WE
ARE NOT THE MAJORITY.
SENATOR FLAKE HAS MADE CLEAR
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE HIM TO BE
COMFORTABLE ON A FINAL PASSAGE
VOTE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE SAY
HERE, THIS WILL BE UP TO
SENATOR SCHUMER IN
SENATOR McCONNELL.
>> SENATOR LEAHY HE?
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I WANT TO
MAKE SURE BECAUSE THIS IS
SOMEWHAT UNPRECEDENTED.
WHEN I DO AGREE WITH THE
SENATOR FROM ARIZONA THAT WE
SHOULD HAVE THIS FURTHER
INVESTIGATION.
SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT
DURING THE WEEK THAT THAT IS
TAKING PLACE, THERE WILL BE
NO ACTION ON THE FLOOR OF
THE UNITED STATES SENATE ON
THIS NOMINATION.
IS THAT CORRECT?
>> I CANNOT SAY THAT --
>> -- LET ME SAY AGAIN.
I CAN'T MAKE THAT STATEMENT
FOR THE LEADERSHIP.
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I WOULD
BE ONLY COMFORTABLE MOVING
FORWARD ON THE FLOOR, I WILL
MOVE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE.
BUT I WILL ONLY BE
COMFORTABLE MOVING ON THE
FLOOR UNTIL THE FBI HAS DONE
MORE INVESTIGATION THAN THEY
HAVE ALREADY.
IT MAY NOT TAKE THEM A WEEK.
I UNDERSTANDING THAT SOME OF
THESE WITNESSES MAY NOT WANT
TO DISCUSS ANYTHING FURTHER.
BUT, I THINK WE OWE THEM DUE
DILIGENCE.
>> FROM CHAIRMAN.
>> MR. CHAIRMAN.
>> JUST A MINUTE.
ALL I HAVE SAID TO SENATOR
FLAKE IS THAT I WOULD
ADVOCATE FOR THE POSITION HE
TOOK BUT I DON'T CONTROL
THAT SENATOR?
>> MR. CHAIRMAN.
>> YES.
SENATOR KLOBUCHAR.
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THERE ARE
OTHER SENATORS AS WELL WHO
MAY BE INTERESTED IN THIS
NEGOTIATION ON THE
REPUBLICAN SIDE AND THERE IS
NOT REALLY A SET AGREEMENT
HERE.
ALL OF US HAVE ALREADY SAID
WE ARE VOTING NO.
IT IS SENATOR FLAKE WORKING
WITH ALL OF US TO SAY FOR
THE GOOD OF THE SENATE AND
THE GOOD OF THE COURT, THE
AMERICAN TEAM DESERVE TO
HAVE THE FACTS FOLLOWED UP
ON.
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE HIS
WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT.
AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IS
ABOUT.
THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT AND BY
THE WAY, IF SENATOR
MCCONNELL WANTS TO GO
FORWARD IN LIGHT OF THAT AND
WE STILL HAVE SEVERAL
SENATORS THAT HAVEN'T SAID
HOW THEY ARE VOTING ON THIS
NOMINEE, I ACTUALLY THINK
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT WHAT
JUST HAPPENED RIGHT NOW.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE AN
AGREEMENT.
IT IS ONE SENATOR WHO IS
STANDING UP.
>> SENATOR CORNYN?
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I JUST WANT
TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION
TO SENATOR FLAKE FOR
ALLOWING THIS PROCESS TO
MOVE FORWARD.
THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCE OF
OPINION AMONG US AS TO WHAT
EXACTLY THE FBI
INVESTIGATION WOULD CONSIST
OF.
SOME OF US THINK IT HAS BEEN
CONCLUDED AND SUM ELEMENT
SUPPLEMENTED BY THIS
COMMITTEE'S INVESTIGATION
OTHERS DISAGREE WITH THAT I
RESPECT THE FACT THAT NOT
ONLY SENATOR FLAKE ADVOCATED
TO GIVE DR. FORD A CHANCE TO
APPEAR IN FRONT OF THE
COMMITTEE, WHICH WAS THE
RIGHT THING TO DO, BUT ALSO
THAT HE HAS ALLOWED THIS
PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD,
SUBJECT TO FURTHER
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT THE
FBI MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO COME UP WITH.
BUT, CERTAINLY, HE MAINTAINS
HIS RIGHT TO CAST HIS VOTE
YEA OR NEY AS HE SEES FIT
AND MAINTAINS SIGNIFICANT
LEVERAGE THAT WAY.
BUT, I APPRECIATE HIS
SUPPORT FOR A FULL AND FAIR
HEARING FOR DR. FORD AND
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AS WELL AS
HIS WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW
THIS TO GO FORWARD SUBJECT
TO HIS REQUEST.
>> MR. CHAIRMAN.
>> MR. CHAIRMAN.
>> SENATOR BLUMENTHAL, OUGHT
TO CALL ON SENATOR
FEINSTEIN.
>> IF I, THROUGH THE CHAIR,
COULD HAVE ASK A QUESTION OF
SENATOR FLAKE, DOES YOUR
AMENDMENT INCLUDE CONTINUING
THE INVESTIGATION DURING
THIS PERIOD OF TIME?
>> IF I CAN RESPOND, THERE
IS NO AMENDMENT.
I'M SIMPLY STATING THE
DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD
BETWEEN US ALL AS S. THAT I
WOULD HOPE AND I THINK WE
HAD SOME AGREEMENT BEFORE HA
THE DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE BEEN,
I THINK, JUSTIFIABLY
UNCOMFORTABLE MOVING AHEAD
COULD PUBLICLY, IN AN EFFORT
TO BRING THIS COUNTRY
TOGETHER, SAY THAT WE WOULD
FEEL BETTER, I'M NOT
EXPECTING THEM TO VOTE YES,
BUT NOT TO COMPLAIN THAT AN
FBI INVESTIGATION HAS NOT
OCCURRED.
AND THIS IS WHAT I'M TRYING
TO DO.
THIS COUNTRY IS BEING RIPPED
APART HERE.
AND WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE DO DUE DILIGENCE.
I THINK THIS COMMITTEE HAS
DONE A GOOD JOB, BUT I DO
THINK THAT WE CAN HAVE A
SHORT PAUSE AND MAKE SURE
THAT THE FBI CAN
INVESTIGATE.
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT
SOME OF US WOULD HAVE TO AND
I'M PREPARED TO DO IT, MAKE
A REQUEST TO THE WHITE HOUSE
TO ASK THE FBI TO DO THAT
INVESTIGATION.
IT WOULD BE SHORT, AND
LIMITED IN SCOPE TO THE
CURRENT ALLEGATIONS THAT
HAVE BEEN MADE.
BUT, I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE
THE DEMOCRATS WHO WE TALKED
TO BEFORE TO ENDORSE THAT
KIND OF THING, THAT WE CAN
THEN MOVE ON.
>> MR. CHAIRMAN?
>> BECAUSE OF THE TWO HOUR
RULE, WE ARE ADJOURNED.
>> WHAT?
>> AND THERE YOU HAVE IT,
YOU HEARD SOMEBODY JUST
SAYING TO CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY,
WHAT?
WE'RE ADJOURNING TWO HOUR
RULE.
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THERE, I
DO NOT BELIEVE WE HAVE AT
LEAST IN THE OPEN ERA EVER
SEEN AND THAT IS SENATOR
JEFF FLAKE WENT INTO THAT
SMALL ANTE ROOM THAT WE WERE
SPEAKING OF JUST BEFORE THEY
TOOK THE VOTE AND HE CUT A
DEAL OF SOME SORTS WITH THE
DEMOCRATS AND THEN IT WASN'T
CLEAR WHAT HE CUT.
SO, CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY SAID A
POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE
ALLOWS SENATOR JEFF FLAKE TO
EXPLAIN TO US BASICALLY WHAT
JUST HAPPENED.
SO SENATOR FLAKE SAID, YOU
KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOING TO VOTE YES ON THE
MOTION TO REPORT THE
NOMINATION OF BRETT
KAVANAUGH TO THE FULL SENATE
FLOOR; HOWEVER, I AGREE WITH
MY DEMOCRAT FRIEND, SENATOR
CHRIS COONS AND OTHERS THAT
THERE NEEDS TO BE AT LEAST A
WEEK, NOT AT LEAST TRIMMED
TO A WEEK AND TRIMMED IN
SCOPE FBI INVESTIGATION INTO
THE TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD
FROM DR. BLASEY FORD AND
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH
YESTERDAY.
AND WITNESSES THAT WERE
COMING FORTH WHO SAID THEY
DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING AND
HEROES WHO SAID THEY DIDN'T
REMEMBER ANYTHING AND
AFFIDAVITS AND ALL OF THAT
THE FBI GETS A PEEK AT THIS.
WELL, AS SENATOR LINDSEY
GRAHAM SAID, YEAH, IT
DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.
IT'S NOT UP TO YOU JEFF
FLAKE AND WE REALIZE THAT
YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT WHEN
IT COMES TO THE FULL SENATE
FLOOR, HOWEVER, IT'S UP TO
CHUCK SCHUMER AND MITCH
MCCONNELL TO WORK OUT A
DEAL.
MITCH MCCONNELL IS THE
MAJORITY LEADER, CHUCK
SCHUMER IS THE MINORITY
LEADER.
YOU ARE NEITHER OF THOSE AND
WHEN THIS GETS TO THE FULL
SENATE, THEY CAN TALK ABOUT
IT AND WE CAN SEE IF THERE
COULD BE AN FBI
INVESTIGATION.
JEFF FLAKE SAYS THOUGH IF
YOU WANT MY VOTE ON THE FULL
FLOOR, THIS IS WHAT IT'S
GONNA TAKE.
WHO DOES HE TAKE WITH HIM?
DOES HE BRING LISA MURKOWSKI
OF ALASKA?
DOES HE BRING SENATOR SUSAN
COLLINS?
DOES HE BRING THOSE SWING
VOTES ALONG WITH HIM IF HE
SAYS NOPE, I'M NOT GOING TO
VOTE UNLESS YOU GIVE AN FBI
INVESTIGATION A WEEK'S TIME
TO MOVE FORWARD.
AND THEN THERE WERE
QUESTIONS.
YOU SAW.
SO DEMOCRATS WERE NOT EVEN
CLEAR ON WHAT THIS MEANT.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN, WHAT ARE
WE VOTING ON WHAT DID I JUST
SAY?
I AM IN FAVOR OF AN FBI
INVESTIGATION.
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
AND HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S JUST
A WEEK?
LET'S BRING IN BRET
