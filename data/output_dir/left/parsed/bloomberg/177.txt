 SAID IT 
WAS BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE  
BANKS ARE READY TO PONY UP  
MONEY SO THE BUYER CAN -- SO  
BAYER CAN MAKE THIS BID.
>> ALL OF THESE SHORT-TERM  
LOANS ACCORDING TO PEOPLE 
FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER, 
DIDN'T THEY JUST SAY THOSE  
CONCERNS THESE KINDS OF 
COMPANIES HAVE NO PROBLEM 
ACCESSING FINANCE?
MATT: RIGHT.
WELL, THERE AREN'T THAT MANY OF 
THESE KINDS OF COMPANIES. 
KEEP IN MIND THIS IT WOULD BE 
BIGGEST DEAL IN GERMAN HISTORY  
AND THEY WOULD FORM THE BIGGEST 
FARM AND SEED MAKER IN THE  
ENTIRE WORLD. 
BUT YES, IF YOU HAVE GOOD 
CREDIT, BANKS OUT THERE HAVE  
THE MONEY AND ARE WILLING TO  
MAKE LOANS TO THOSE WITH GOOD 
CREDIT. 
THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT THEY 
SHOULD BE DOING.
THE QUESTION IS, IS THIS THE  
RIGHT VALUATION?
WE'RE TALKING WHAT COULD BE 
17.5 TIMES. 
THAT'S A PRETTY HEFTY PENNY.
>> MATT MILLER FROM BERLIN. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> AND OVER TO WAL-MART WHICH 
IS HOLDING ITS SHAREHOLDER  
MEETING TODAY.
JOINING US LIVE IN FAYETTEVILLE 
IS SHANNON. 
LET'S TALK ABOUT -- WALL  
MATURITY SAYING THEY ARE GOING  
TO USE UBER AND LIFT TO MAKE  
DELIVERIES? 
>> YES. 
SOME BIG GROCERY NEWS FOR THEM  
AND A WAY TO FORLT FIVE THIS  
WALL AROUND GROCERIES.
IT'S LIKE AMAZON AND GOOGLE ALL 
TRYING TO GET INTO THE GROCERY  
BUSINESS AND TRY TO MAKE TO IT  
WHERE UBER OR LIFT DRIVERS WILL 
PICK UP YOUR GROCERY LIST AND 
DELIVER THEM. 
WE WILL TALK A LOT MORE ABOUT 
THAT. 
>> HOW MUCH OF THIS IS NOT JUST 
ABOUT WAL-MART BUT AMAZON.
>> I THINK ALMOST EVERYTHING  
WAL-MART DOES AT THIS POINT HAS 
SOMETHING TO DO WITH AMAZON AND 
EVERY OTHER RETAILER LIKE 
TARGET TRYING TO PUSH THINGS  
ONLINE. 
THEY WERE A STEP BEHIND AMAZON  
WHEN AMAZON CAME IN BUT THEY  
ARE NOT GOING TO LET THAT 
HAPPEN TO THEIR GROCERY 
BUSINESS. 
HALF OF THEIR BUSINESS COMES  
FROM GROCERIES. 
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO 
THEM. 
>> NOW LET'S GO TO JOHN FOR A 
LOOK AT THE MARKETS.
JOHN? 
JULIE: YES. 
ABOUT 23 MINUTES FROM THE 
PAYROLL REPORT. 
IN LONDON FURTHER FTSE WE ARE 
HIGHER. 
THE GLOBAL FX MARKET, THE G 10  
SPACE, NO DRAMA HERE EITHER.
A TWO-MONTH HIGH. 
THE BRITISH POUND, UNCHANGED. 
THE FX MARKET DOING NOTHING 
AHEAD OF THAT.
YOU SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE  
SCREEN, 30 YEARS BUNS DOWN BY 2 
1/2 AND THE 10-YEAR BACK BELOW  
10 BASIS POINTS, SO A BID FOR 
BUNS IN THE BOND MARKET.
WTI DOWN BY .0 OF%. 
BUT EVERYTHING COUNTS, I'VE GOT 
TO SAY. 
CALM WATERS AHEAD OF THE  
PAYROLL REPORT. 
LET'S HEAD OVER TO ABOUT AGAIL  
DOOLITTLE FOR A FEW STOCKS TO 
WATCH.
>> YES. 
THE DELAY IS DUE TO ALL THE 
ISSUES THE COMPANY HAS BEEN 
STRUCK WITH OVER THE PAST YEAR  
OR SO.
THE STOCK IS MAINLY UNCHANGED.
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST DEFAULT 
NOTICE. 
THE STOCK, HOWEVER, IS DOWN 87% 
OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS.
NOW, TRADING HIGHER IN THE  
PREMARKET IS GAS AFTER THE  
COMPANY DID BEATEST MATS. 
DOWN JUST 3% VERSUS THE DECLINE 
OF 6.5%.
TODAY DID SAY THE IMPROVEMENT 
WENT INTO THE MEMORIAL DAY  
WEEKEND.
PRESSURED PERHAPS BY A HIGH 
BEARISH SHORT INTEREST OF 14%.
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TOP 
STOCKS WE'RE WATCHING THIS  
MORNING MEGAN.
>> THANKS ABOUT AGAIL.
HERE'S EMMA CHANDA WITH THIS  
MORNING'S NEWS. 
>> BRITISH PRIME MINISTER 
CAMERON DENYING.
>> WE HAVE TO NEGOTIATE OUR 
EXIT AND TRADING ARRANGEMENTS 
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND 53  
OTHERS. 
MY VIEW THIS WOULD TAKE A 
DECADE. 
DO WE WANT A DECADE OF  
UNCERTAINTY?
DO OUR BUSINESSES WANT A DECADE 
OF UNCERTAINTY? 
TURKEY'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS  
THEY PLAN TO TAKE FURTHER 
MEASURES TO LABEL THE GENOCIDE  
A CENTURY AGO BUT ANOTHER SAYS  
NO ONE SHOULD EXPECT THAT TO  
DETERIORATE ENTIRELY. 
AND -- IT WAS A QUIET NIGHT FOR 
THE SPLASH BROTHERS BUT THEIR 
TEAMMATES MADE PLENTY OF NOISE  
WITHOUT THEM. 
SHAUN LIVINGSTON SCORED 20

VERIZON WORKERS MAKE IT HARD  
CENTER SOMEONE NEEDS TO TELL ME 
HOW THE MAKE THIS EX VERIZON. 
WE ARE HERE FOR THE REST OF THE 
NEWS. 
MORE "GO" IS NEXT.
♪ 
>> THIS IS BLOOMBERG "GO" I'M 
DAVID WESTEN. 
IN LESS THAN 20 MINUTES FROM  
NOW A BRAND-NEW READING ON THE  
U.S. ECONOMY. 
THE  UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEMED 
TO BE TICKING DOWN SLIGHTLY.
JOINING ME NOW FROM NEW YORK IS 
JACK. 
LET'S START WITH YOU. 
OBVIOUSLY, THE FIRST THING YOU  
WILL SEE IS THE TOP LINE  
NUMBER. 
WHAT'S THE SECOND THING YOU 
LOOK FOR? 
>> WAGES. 
THIS IS A CRAZY NUMBER. 
IN THIS MONTH WE ARE ACTUALLY 
HIRING CLOSE TO 900,000 PEOPLE  
AND IT'S EASILY ADJUSTED TO 160 
OR 1 70.
>> SIX TO ONE.
AND THAT'S A NET NUMBER YOU'RE  
GIVING US?
>> YES. 
A NET NUMBER OF HIRINGS.
>> AND THE ADJUSTMENT IS THAT 
MUCH? 
>> YES. 
SO 36,000 OUT FOR VERIZON IS  
REALLY ,000 BUT PEOPLE ARE  
GOING TO MAKE LOTS OF NOISE 
ABOUT THIS. 
FRANKLY I COULD CARE LESS ABOUT 
THE NUMBER AND MORE INTERESTED  
IN THE WAGE NUMBER BECAUSE  
THAT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT  
ON PROFITS AND LIT TELL US  
SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON 
WITH THAT.
>> I WOULDN'T LOOK AT THE WAGE  
NUMBER BUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT 
NUMBER. 
I THINK WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN  
THE WAGE NUMBER.
THE MORE RETIREES WE HAVE, THE  
LOWER THAT IS GOING TO GO 
BECAUSE YOU'RE REPLACING  
HIGHER-PAID WORKERS WITH  
LOWER-PAID WORKERS. 
JUST LOOK AT THE UNEMPLOYMENT 
NUMBER. 
IF THAT IS DROPPING THAT MEANS  
WAGES ARE GOING TO START  
PICKING UP. 
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT WAGES, AND  
WE ALSO LOOK AT THE LABOR FORCE 
PAY RATE WHICH HAS ALSO BEEN AN 
ISSUE, WHAT DO YOU NEED TO SEE  
FROM THOSE WAGES? 
THAT REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 
THAT POPS UP? 
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE 
NUMBER PEOPLE THAT ARE CHANGING 
JOBS AND UNFILLED JOBS. 
TO FILL THOSE JOBS WE HAVE TO 
RAISE WAGES.
WE SORT OF DEALT WITH THE ISSUE 
OF GETTING WHAT I CALL THE OIL  
WORKERS OUT OF THE NUMBER 
BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING PAID  
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER. 
WHAT I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE IS 
.2 OR .3% OF AN INCREASE ON 
WHAT I CALL THE AVERAGE WEEKLY  
WAGE THAT'S TAKING PLACE. 
IF YOU ADD 160 OR 1270,000  
PEOPLE TO THE WORKFORCE IT'S  
EASILY ADJUSTED, YOU'RE GOING 
TO HAVE TOTAL AVAILABLE FUNDS 
TO SPEND IN THE ECONOMY.
>> DREW MADDOX, PUTTING ALL 
THIS TOGETHER, WE ARE ABOUT TO  
SEE SUB200,000 AGAIN AND AGAIN  
SOMETHING AROUND 150, THAT'S  
GOING TO BE CONSIDERED HEALTHY, 
BECAUSE AS YOU REACH EMPLOYMENT 
-- BUT LET'S SAY THAT HAPPENS 
AND WE DON'T GET THE WAGE TO GO 
ALONG WITH IT, WHAT DOES THE  
FED DO? 
>> I THINK THE FED GOES BACK TO 
WHAT IS THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 
DOING?
IT WILL BE DRIVING UNEMPLOYMENT 
RATE LOWER AND LOWER AND  
EVENTUALLY WHAT THAT IS GOING 
TO SPARK IS PRESSURE FOR PEOPLE 
TO BID AWAY WORKERS.
WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO SEE 
WITH WAGES TO GO UP IS IF YOUR  
NEIGHBOR QUITS THEIR JOB AND  
YOUR NEIGHBOR'S NEIGHBOR QUITS  
THEIR JOB, PRETTY SOON YOUR 
FIRM IS GOING TO SAY WE EITHER  
WANT THIS GUY OR HE IS GOING TO 
QUIT AND THAT WILL DRIVE WAGES  
HIGHER. 
SO WHAT YOU NEED TO SEE IS MORE 
PEOPLE QUITTING THEIR JOBS AND  
THAT WILL MAKE WAGES HIGHER.
>> HAVEN'T WE ALREADY SEEN A  
BIG INCREASE IN THE QUIT RATE?
YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO GO  
HIGHER? 
>> YES. 
AND WE PERVERSELY NEED TO SEE 
JOBS DO MORE FIRING.
THEY NEED TO SEE LOW PERFORMERS 
BECAUSE FIRMS WOULD RATHER KEEP 
THE PERSON THEY HAVE ON THAT  
MIGHT BE UNDERPERFORMING THAN 
CHURNING THEM OUT AND ACTUALLY  
REPLACING THEM, TRADING THEM  
UP. 
IT'S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY.
SOUNDS HARD BUT THE PERSON WHO  
GETS CHURNED OUT, THEY MAY GO 
TO A PLACE THAT IS BETTER FOR 
THEM AND THE FIRM MIGHT BE MORE 
PRODUCTIVE. 
>> JOBS THAT -- AVAILABLE JOB 
OPENINGS HAS BEEN FLYING QUITE  
AGGRESSIVELY SINCE THE  
FINANCIAL CRISIS OF TWEEVERPB 
2009. 
I BELIEVE IT'S THE WHITE LINE 
ON THAT SHOT WHAT ELSE DO YOU 
LOOK AT IN 12 MINUTES' TIME TO  
REALLY GAUGE WHAT'S HAPPENING 
IN THIS LABOR MARKET? 
>> WELL CLAIMS ARE MY NUMBER  
ONE THING.
IF NO ONE'S BEING FIRED THEN  
NOTHING IS -- QUOTE, UNQUOTE, 
BAD IS HAPPENING IN THE 
ECONOMY.
IF A FIRM WERE IN REAL TROUBLE, 
THEY WOULD BE FIRING PEOPLE AND 
WE'RE NOT SEEING ANYONE FIRE SO 
WE NEED TO BREAK OUT OF THAT  
AND SEE MORE CHURNING IN THE  
LABOR MARKET. 
>> DREW, WE ALSO HEAR FROM  
ECONOMISTS THAT THE AVERAGE 
HOURS WORKED IS A CRITICAL  
NUMBER. 
IS THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU? 
>> IT IS, AND MY COLLEAGUE SAM  
HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK ON THIS, 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT ON AN 
INDUSTRY-BY-STRI BASIS, IT  
TELLS US IF YOU WANT TO BOOST 
OUTPUT YOU CAN'T ADD HOURS  
BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY AT A PEAK 
IN A SECTOR-BY-SECTOR BASIS.
>> I CAN SEE THAT IN  
MANUFACTURING WHERE IF YOU'RE 
EXTENDING, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO  
EXTEND YOUR OUTPUT, YOU WOULD 
SEND MORE OVERTIME. 
I'M NOT SURE THAT HAPPENS AS  
MUCH IN THE SERVICES. 
>> THAT'S A GREAT POINT AND 
THAT TELLS YOU SOMETHING ABOUT  
THE OVERALL DATA QUALITY. 
WE NEED TO LOOK FOR COMPELLING  
EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS IT AND 
THINGS THAT DISPROVE OUR  
THESIS. 
THE ISSUE WITH HOURS WORKED 
THEY SAY ON THE BASIS OF 35 
HOURS A WEEK, I WISH THAT WERE  
THE CASE. 
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.
JACK RIPKEN, C.E.O. AND CHIEF 
INVESTMENT STRATEGIST.
>> I WANT TO STEADY OUR 
WORKWEEK, 35. 
I'D LOVE THAT.
>> THAT IS NOT US.
COMING UP ON "GO," THE POUND

I'M JONATHON FERRELL. 
WE WERE SEVEN MINUTES AWAY FROM 
THE PAYROLL REPORT. 
WE ARE THREE WEEKS AWAY FROM A  
VOTE. 
SO HOW CLOSELY IS JANET YELLEN  
AND THE LIKE WATCHING WHAT  
HAPPENS IN THE U.K.?
>> THERE'S JUST A LOT OF  
UNCERTAINTY.
THERE'S UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE 
RESULTS, OBVIOUSLY, BUT I THINK 
THERE'S UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHAT  
WOULD HAPPEN IN A LEAD VOTE AND 
IN A LEAD VOTE IN MARKETS.
SO UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, 
IT'S A FACTORY I WOULD  
CONSIDER. 
>> A FACTORY HE WOULD CONSIDER. 
IN FACT WE FOLLOW UP AND ASK IS 
IT ABOUT GROWTH OR STABILITY? 
AND HE SAYS IT'S ABOUT THE  
MARKETS.
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? 
>> WELL, I DON'T THINK IT'S 
ABOUT THE MARKETS, BUT IF I 
WERE ON THE FED I WOULD WAIT  
AND SEE ON THAT BECAUSE THERE'S 
SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE 
VOTES THESE DAYS. 
WE CAN MAKE ALL THE PUNDIT  
PROGNOSTICATIONS BUT THE  
REALITY IS THIS IS AN 
ANTI-CAMERON VOTE AND NOT 
WHETHER BREXIT IS A FACTORY OR  
NOT.
>> THE CHANCE LEGISLATOR SAID 
HE WOULD HAVE TO MOVE BONDS OUT 
OF THE U.K. IF THEY VOTE -- 
>> IF THE U.K., WHICH IS NOT  
THAT BIG OF A MARKET IS 
REMOVING ITSELF FROM WHAT'S 
GOING ON IN THE REST OF EUROPE, 
THEN I THINK YOU HAVE TO SHIFT. 
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A GEOGRAPHIC 
SHIFT AS TO WHERE YOU'RE  
PUTTING YOUR WORKERS. 
THE U.K. IS A BIG FINANCIAL 
CENTER, BUT IT'S NOT A BIG  
CONTRIBUTOR TO THE GLOBAL 
G.D.P.
THE REST OF EUROPE IS.
>> AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS 
BEING A GLOBAL PHENOMENON, DO 
YOU SEE STRANDS OF THAT IN THE  
U.S. OF THE SAME KIND OF POP  
WILL YOU EXPLAIN? 
>> WELL, OF COURSE WE DO. 
THIS IS RIGHT OUT OF LEONARD  
KOHN. 
THIS IS DEMOCRACY COMING TO THE 
SSA, RAW DEMOCRACY, THAT'S WHY  
IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT  
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN EASY  
PREVIOUSLY TO SAY THE 
ESTABLISHMENT SAYS WE NEED TO 
PRESERVE WHAT WE HAVE GOT BUT 
THESE FOLKS ARE NOT VOTING FOR  
THE ESTABLISHMENT.
THEY ARE NOT DOING IT IN THE  
U.K. OR THE U.S. OR IN TURKEY 
OR IN LOTS OF PLACES. 
ACTUALLY THEIR PREJUDICES.
>> WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE IS GOING TO PAY 
ATTENTION TO WHETHER OR NOT 
THEY HIKE INTEREST RATES. 
>> I THINK IT DOES, MAYBE THAT  
IS WHERE WE GET BACK TO 
MARKETS.
BECAUSE I THINK THE FED IS VERY 
SENSITIVE TO WHAT'S GOING ON  
THERE AND THE FED IS ALSO VERY  
SENSITIVE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING 
-- IT'S A POLITICAL ENTITY AND  
IT HAS TO PAY ATTENTION TO  
WHAT'S GOING ON.

WILL THE NUMBERS BE STRONG  
ENOUGH?

JONATHAN: 30 SECONDS AWAY FROM
THE JOBS REPORT.
HERE IS THE STATE OF PLAY IN THE
MARKETS.
THE FTSE UP BY ONE PERCENTAGE
POINT.
THE DAX AT .5%.
THE JOBS REPORT NOW.
DAVID: 38,000 JOBS, THAT IS THE
NUMBER CREATED IN THE MONTH OF
MAY.
THE LOWEST JOB GROWTH IN THIS
COUNTRY SINCE SEPTEMBER 2010.
NOT ALL OF WHAT WE SAW IN THE
MONTH OF MAY WAS DUE TO THE
VERIZON STRIKE.
YES, INFORMATION AND TELECOM
EMPLOYMENT WAS DOWN.
THE MANUFACTURING WAS DOWN BY
10,000.
MINING WAS DOWN BY 10000 AND
CONSTRUCTION WAS DOWN BY 15,000.
BUT THERE IS MORE BAD NEWS.
MARCH OR PAYROLLS -- MARCH
PAYROLLS WERE REVISED.
SO WE HAD 38,000 JOBS CREATED IN
THE MONTH OF MAY, BUT 59,000
JOBS SUBTRACTED FROM THE
PREVIOUS TWO MONTHS.
BUT THERE IS MORE.
458,000 PEOPLE LEFT THE
WORKFORCE LAST MONTH AND SO THAT
HAVE THE EFFECT ON THE ONE HAND,
PUSHING THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
DOWN TO 4.7%, THE LOWEST SINCE
NOVEMBER 2007.
BUT IT ALSO REVERSED THE RECENT
GAINS IN LABOR FORCE
PARTICIPATION, WHICH IS NOW BACK
TO DECEMBER LEVELS AT 62.2%.
WAGE GROWTH CAME IN ON TARGET,
UP 2.5% YEAR-OVER-YEAR AND 0.2%
FOR THE MONTH OF MAY.
57,000 JOBS WERE CREATED IN
EDUCATION.
AND LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT
CONTINUED TO DROP.
LET ME JUST RECAP.
NONFARM PAYROLLS GROWTH OF JUST
38,000, THE LEAST SINCE
SEPTEMBER 2010.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE STANDS AT
4.7%.
JONATHAN: IT IS A HUGE MISS ON
THE HEADLINE NUMBER.
LOOK AT THE MARKET REACTION FROM
THE END OF THE CURVE.
ANNETTE THAT RALLY.
WE ARE LOWER BY SEVEN BASIS
POINTS ON THE TWO-YEAR NOTE
YIELD.
LOWER YIELDS ON THE FRONT AND
MEANS A WEAKER DOLLAR.
TWO-YEAR YIELDS, 82 BASIS
POINTS.
BUT LET'S LOOK AT THE DOLLAR
REACTION ON THE FX MARKET.
THE DOLLAR INDEX MOVES MUCH
LOWER.
WEAKER DOLLAR STORY.
LET'S BRING UP THE FUTURES BOARD
VERY QUICKLY AND TELL YOU THE
STATE OF PLAY IN THE EQUITIES
MARKET.
FUTURES UP BY 42.
S&P 500 FUTURES NEGATIVE SIX.
NASDAQ FUTURES DOWN.
SO IT IS A SIGNIFICANT MISS.
THE PREVIOUS MONTH REVISED LOWER
AS WELL.
IT LOOKS UGLY, UGLY, UGLY.
BUT UNEMPLOYMENT IN LINE COME IN
FACT, BELOW EXPECTATIONS OF
4.7%.
AND WAGE GROWTH IN LINE AT 2.5%.
ONE MAN WITH A VIEW ON THE BOND
MARKET AND THE LABOR MARKET
DATA, BILL GROSS, OF JANUS

TOM: BILL, THIS IS SUCH A
STUNNING REPORT.
WE ARE GOING TO KEEP DR.
GLASSMAN WITH US FOR A FEW
MINUTES.
BILL, THIS IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE
SPOKEN ABOUT IN YOUR NOSE FOR
YEARS.
WITHIN ALL OF THE CONSENSUS,
THERE CAN ALWAYS BE A SHOCK.
IS THIS REPORT ENOUGH OF A SHOCK
TO ALTER FED ACTION?
BILL: I THINK IT IS ENOUGH OF A
SHOCK TO DELAY JUNE AND INTO
JULY FOR SURE.
THE FED IS TRYING TO CONVINCE US
THAT ONE OR TWO HIKES THIS YEAR
IS IN THE CARDS.
I THINK THEY WANT THEM TO BE
NORMALIZED AND THE YIELD CURVE
TO BE NORMALIZED.
BUT THIS CANCELS OUT JUNE IN
COMBINATION WITH BRIGHT'S IT --
WITH BREXIT.
MIKE: THE FED CARES MUCH LESS
ABOUT THE NONFARM NUMBER
MONTH-TO-MONTH THAN THEY DO
ABOUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE --
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.
BILL: IT IS, THEY DO.
AT 4.7%, THE PERCENTAGE RATE IS
DOWN A FEW TICKS AND THAT IS
PERHAPS PART OF IT.
IT IS A CONFUSING REPORT.
I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU AND JIM
GLASSMAN THAT BASICALLY IT IS A
NORMAL REPORT WITHOUT THE NUMBER
IN TERMS OF PAYROLL.
SO WE WILL HAVE TO SEE GOING
FORWARD.
TOM: THIS IS REMARKABLE.
DR. GLASSMAN, I WANT YOU TO GIVE
US A PERSPECTIVE TO HELP.
THE TWO-YEAR YIELD, MAY I
SUGGEST THE MARKET AND THE
VIGILANTES ARE A BIT AWAY FROM
THE DOTS?
MR. GLASSMAN: IT IS NOT CLEAR.
PEOPLE HAVE A MORE PESSIMISTIC
VIEW OF THE OUTLOOK OR THE
EQUITY MARKET DOESN'T SEEM TO
SHARE THAT.
OR IS IT THAT PEOPLE THINK THAT
THE FED IS JUST WANT TO BE A LOT
MORE CAUTIOUS?
AND IT IS A GLOBAL ECONOMY.
WE ARE MUCH MORE INTERCONNECTED.
RATE PLUS ZERO ELSEWHERE.
WE ARE FEELING ALL OF THAT.
MIKE: I WANTED TO THROW IN HERE
THAT I LOOKED UP THE NUMBERS.
37,000 PEOPLE OFF THE
TELECOMMUNICATIONS CATEGORY.
THAT IS ESSENTIALLY THE NET
TOM: ONE MORE QUESTION WITH YOU,
JIM GLASSMAN.
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A NEGATIVE
STATISTIC AND WE ADD IN 37,000
NOISE FROM VERIZON.
THIS IS WITHIN THE DISPERSION
MONTH-TO-MONTH.
HELP BILL GROSS HERE.
THIS IS AN OUTLINE REPORT GOOD
OF JIM: THE BLS WILL TELL YOU
THAT THE STANDARD ERROR IS
2000.
WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT.
THERE IS A LOT OF NOISE.
THIS IS NOT THE ONLY REPORTER
LOOK TO FOR GUIDANCE ON WHAT IS
GOING ON IN THE JOB MARKET.
JOBLESS CLAIMS ARE AT VERY LOW
LEVELS.
THE ADP SURVEY IS IN THE FOR --
IN THE BALLPARK, STEADY.
WE HAVE A SEPARATE INDEPENDENT
REPORT ON THE LABOR MARKET.
I WOULD SAY THE HEADLINE IS
PROBABLY THE ABERRATION.
TOM: JIM, THANK YOU FOR STAYING
LONGER THAN USUAL.
L GROSS, YOU JUST HEARD ONE OF
OUR GREAT MARKET ECONOMISTS GO
THROUGH THE MINUTIA.
DO YOU TRUST MINUTIA ANYMORE?
BILL: IT IS HARD TO TRUST MANY
NUMBERS.
LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY.
YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT -- IT IS
IN THE FAVOR OF THE FED TO BIAS
THE DOTS TO THE HIGHEST SIDE.
IT IS AS FLAT AS IT HAS BEEN FOR
THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS.
NET INTEREST MARGINS ON BANKS
AND PRODUCING A FLAT CURVE THAT
IS REALLY DESTRUCTIVE FOR THE
CAPITAL GROWTH.
SO THERE IS A BIAS ON THE SIDE
OF THE FED TO MAKE THE MARKET
BELIEVES SOMEHOW WE WILL SEE 2,
3, 4, GOING FORWARD IN THE NEXT
SEVERAL YEARS AND THAT IS THE
REASON WHY WE SEE THAT.
TOM: BILL, WE COULD KEEP YOU
OFFER FOR FIVE HOURS ON THIS
SHOCKING REPORT.
I WANT YOU, BILL GROSS, TWOFOLD

THE YEN'S ABENOMICS -107.91.
I KNOW YOU WENT LONG ON GERMAN
10 YEAR ON MONDAY, BILL.
THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON
HERE, BILL, ON AN INTERNATIONAL
BASIS THAT CHAIR YELLEN WILL
HAVE TO DIGEST.
IS IT THE FOLLOW-ON ON GLOBAL
DEFLATION AND DISINFLATION?
BILL: LET'S BE FAIR.
IT'S BOTH.
CENTRAL BANKS APPLYING
QUANTITATIVE EASING IN EURO LAND
AND IN JAPAN ARE RESPONDING TO
THE POTENTIAL FOR DEFLATION.
THERE IS RELATIVELY NO INFLATION
IN EURO LAND AND NO INFLATION IN
JAPAN.
SO THAT IS THE RESPONSE.
BUT TO BE FAIR, THE REASON
INTEREST RATES ARE THIS LOW IS
NOT ONLY THE POLICY RATES BEING
SET BY CENTRAL BANKS, BUT $80
BILLION A MONTH THAT THE ECB IS
BUYING AND NOW THEY ARE BUYING
CORPORATE BONDS.
THAT IS A LOT OF FIREPOWER.
TO SEE THE 10-YEAR GERMAN BUND
AT -- GERMAN BUNDES AT SEVEN.
IT IS RELATIVELY DISRUPTIVE IN
THE LONG TERM FOR CAPITAL.

HERE UNTIL THE 9:00 HOUR.
MIKE: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT

DOES IT REALLY MATTER?
JANET YELLEN SPEAKS ON MONDAY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE SAYS GIVEN
THE FED POSTURE TOWARDS INTEREST
RATES IN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FED WHAT --
THE FED'S CREDIT ABILITY?
BILL: I THINK SHE CONTINUES TO
SAY IT.
AND SHE HAS CHANGED A LITTLE
BIT.
SHE WAS HAWKISH, THEN RELATIVELY
HAWKISH, NOW DOVISH AND INCLINED
TO MOVE HIGHER OVER THE NEXT SIX
TO 12 MONTHS.
I THINK SHE IS BEING INFLUENCED
BY MANY OF THE FED GOVERNORS, TO
TRY TO RE-NORMALIZE INTEREST
RATES.
THERE IS A CONTINGENT THAT
BELIEVES, AND I BELIEVED THIS
FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS, THEN
NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES AND LOW
INTEREST RATES ARE DESTRUCTIVE
FOR BUSINESS MODELS AND
ULTIMATELY FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH
HERE IN MY DON'T THINK THE FED
REALLY HAS THAT IN THEIR MODEL
MAKING.
BUT ULTIMATELY, JANET YELLEN
WILL CONTINUE TO SUGGEST ONE OR
TWO HIKES OVER THE BALANCE OF
2016 AND PERHAPS THE SAME FOR
2017.
UNLESS WE GET BACK TO ONE OR
1.5% OR 2% NORMAL SHORT-TERM
INTEREST RATES.
THEN THE MANY BUSINESS MODELS
AND GERMAN COMPANIES AND BANKS
AND PENSION FUNDS, HOUSEHOLD
SAVERS ARE BASICALLY IN DEEP,
DEEP DO DO.
MIKE: THAT'S A TECHNICAL TERM.
WHAT IS YOUR DOT PLOT.
WITH THE FED GOING FORWARD, YOU
SUGGEST MAYBE JULY.
HOW QUICKLY DO THEY MOVE GOING
INTO 2017?
BILL: I THINK THEY WAIT UNTIL
DECEMBER AND DO IT GRADUALLY.
I THINK THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE
TYPE OF APPROACH.
A HIGH LOVE LITTLE -- A HIGHLY
LEVERAGED DOMESTIC ECONOMY AND
WORLD ECONOMY TO THE EXTENT THAT
THE U.S. IS THE LEADER IN TERMS
OF INTEREST RATES.
THE GLOBAL CENTRAL BANK, TO THE
EXTENT THAT THEY MOVE TOO FAST
AND THE POTENTIAL FOR ANOTHER
LEHMAN IN 2017 ARE 2018.
I THINK IT IS GRADUAL.
THERE IS ONE MORE HIKE AFTER
THAT.
TOM: STAN E-MAILED INTO OUR
BLOOMBERG RADIO STUDIOS AND SAID
THE REASON WHY THE JOBS REPORT
IS SO BAD IS BECAUSE EVERYONE IS
LEAVING THE COUNTRY.
MIKE: I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GO
THERE.
THAT WOULD BE TOO EASY.
TOM: FUTURES ARE FLAT NOW.
THEY ARE NOW -7.

GROSS, MAKING MONEY TODAY.
BILL GROSS, MINTING MONEY, THE
TWO-YEAR, .79%.
A LITTLE BIT OF CURVE STEEPING,
BUT YET A STUNNING 1.07 90.
YOU TALKED ABOUT PENTHOUSE
MANAGERS.
HOW BIG IS THE BUBBLE RIGHT NOW?
BILL: I THINK IT'S BIG.
AND YOU'LL NOTICE WITH NEGATIVE
INTEREST RATES AND 40% OR 50% OF
THE DEVELOPED MARKET WORLD,
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THERE IS
A BUBBLE WITH 25 BASIS POINTS ON
THE FIVE-YEAR.
THAT THAT IS A MARKET BUBBLE IS
ALMOST UNDENIABLE.
TO MY WAY OF THINKING, THE
MARKETS HAVE A LONG TIME TO
ADJUST TO THESE INTEREST RATES
AS THEY HAVE MOVED LOWER.
EQUITY PRICES IN TERMS OF EQUITY
RATIOS, IT'S ALL GOT TO BE
CONNECTED TO SOME EXTENT AND IT
IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT WHEN YOU
GET TO EQUITY RISKS.
BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THERE
ARE BUBBLES AND FINANCIAL
MARKETS, DISTORTING THE REAL
ECONOMY.
AND AT SOME POINT, A
RENORMALIZATION IS GOING TO
BEGIN TO AFFECT THEM ALL IN
TERMS OF TOTAL RETURN.
TOM: WHAT WILL JANET YELLEN
FOCUS ON?
DOES SHE FOCUS ON THE ORTHODOX
OF ECONOMICS?
DOES SHE FOCUS ON SOME NEW
ECONOMICS?
DOES SHE FOCUS ON YOUR FINANCIAL
SYSTEM AS SHE DRESSED TO GET NOT
ONLY TO JUNE AND JULY, BUT
FRIENDLY TO GET INTO THE THIRD
AND FOURTH ORDER THIS YEAR?
WHICH SHE FOCUS ON?
BILL -- WHAT SHOULD SHE FOCUS
ON?
BILL: I THINK IN A YELLEN'S
CONVENTIONAL, WHICH IS
UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE WE ARE IN A
NEW FINANCIAL ERROR THAT
REQUIRES A DIFFERENT ADJUSTMENT.
-- FINANCIAL ERA THAT
REQUIRES A DIFFERENT ADJUSTMENT.
I THINK YELLEN COME ALTHOUGH SHE
IS IN CHARGE, AND SHE HAS MADE
IT VERY CLEAR THROUGH HER PRESS
CONFERENCES COME I THINK YELLEN
IS CONVENTIONAL AND PROBABLY
WILL CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT
LOWER INTEREST RATES STIMULATE
ASSET PRICES AND THAT THE
TRICKLE DOWN FROM ASSET PRICES
STIMULATES REAL GROWTH.
THAT HAS BEEN A FAILURE TO THE
WE DESTINED MY WAY OF THINKING
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.
BUT SHE WILL STICK TO THAT WE
WILL HAVE TO SEE IN TERMS OF
POLICY GOING FORWARD.
BUT I THINK SOMETHING NEW AND
SOMETHING DIFFERENT IS REQUIRED.
MIKE: IS THIS A DANGEROUS TIME
IN THE MARKETS AND A DANGEROUS
-- A DIFFICULT TIME FOR THE FED
TO INTERPRET WHAT THE MARKETS
ARE SAYING?
IF THEY ARE DISTORTED BY THE
FED, THEY HAVE TO REACT TO THIS
NUMBER,.
YOU'VE GOT THE BREXIT DEBATE
COMING UP.
SHOULD THEY TURN OFF A BLOOMBERG
MACHINES AND MAKE A DECISION
WITHOUT LOOKING AT EVERYTHING?
BILL: TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE
ARE A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL VIEWS
IS INFORMATIVE, BUT NONETHELESS
CONFUSING TO SOME EXTENT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU SHUT IT
DOWN ONCE YOU TURN IT OFF.
BUT TO SOME EXTENT COME I THINK
THEY SHOULD -- BUT TO SOME
EXTENT, I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE
A STANDARD MESSAGE.
MIKE: THE BUREAU OF LABOUR'S
DISTANCE OR PORCELAIN 38,000
JOBS CREATED DURING THE MONTH OF
MAY.
AVERAGE WEEKLY HOURS UNCHANGED.
THE NUMBERS ARE NOT BAD.
TOM: THE IMMEDIATE DURATION CAME
INTO A CONSTRUCTIVE PLACE AS
WELL.
I WOULD SUGGEST WHAT IS
DIFFERENT HERE IS LAST TIME, WE
HAD A NUMBER OF -- AN ABRUPT
MARKET MOVING AND RETRACING.
WHAT DO YOU DO IN THE BOND
MARKET, WITH PRICES UP AND
YIELDS DOWN LIKE THIS, DOES BILL
GROSS GET OFF THE TELEVISION AND
RADIO AND DOES HE GO TO CASH?
BELL: I THINK YOU BEGIN TO
REDUCE DURATION.
THAT WAS ONE OF THE WINDS OF MY
INVESTMENT OUTLOOK WHEN I TALKED
ABOUT THE PENTHOUSE AND THE
OCCUPANTS CHANGING OVER TIME.
WE HAVE HAD A FOUR-YOUR PERIOD
OF HIGHER PRICES AND LOWER
YIELDS, HIGHER STOCK RISES, 10%
ON STOCKS AND 7% ON BONDS.
AT THESE LEVELS AND WITH LOWER
LEVELS TODAY COME AT SOME POINT,
AND INVESTOR HAS TO BEGIN TO
RECOGNIZE THAT THESE ARE
BUBBLE-TYPES OF LEVELS AND THE
JERRY, THAT IS THE YIELD, NOT
ONLY IMPLICIT IN LONGER
EXTENSIONS ON THE YIELD CURVE,
BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF CREDIT
SPREADS OR IN TERMS OF
VOLATILITY -- YEAH, AND INVESTOR
HAS TO REDUCE CARRY BY HOLDING
MORE IN CASH AND LOWERING
DURATION, SELLING FOR BONDS
TODAY, AS YOUR QUESTIONS
SUGGESTS.
AND ULTIMATELY TRYING TO FIND A
REVERSAL.
I DON'T THINK IT IS AT THAT
POINT NOW.
BUT AT SOME POINT, IT WILL BE
BETTER SERVED BY SELLING AS
OPPOSED TO BUYING PROGRAM TOM:
-- BUYING.
TOM: I DO WANT TO GET TO MEXICO
LATER.
BUT RIGHT NOW, I WANT YOU TO
ADDRESS THE SHOCK OF A NUMBER OF
YEARS AGO WHEN BILL GROSS SAID
WE WOULD HAVE FINANCIAL
REPRESSION FOR DECADES.
I WOULD SUGGEST LOOKING AT MY
BLOOMBERG'S SCREEN, YOU ARE
PREPARED TO REAFFIRM THAT THIS
MORNING.
BILL: I THINK THAT'S TRUE.
THAT IS HOW CENTRAL BANKS DO IT
OR THAT IS ONE OF THE WAYS GET
OUT OF A DECK ISIS.
THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS.
YOU CAN GROW OUT OF IT.
WE ARE NOT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB
OF THAT.
OR YOU CAN HOLD NEGATIVE
INTEREST RATE, NEGATIVE REAL
INTEREST RATES COME IN ORDER TO
BASICALLY TAKE MONEY OUT OF
SAVERS'S MARKETS -- POCKETS.
THEY BASICALLY STRIP SAVERS OF
THE REAL INVESTMENT.
SO HOW LONG WILL THIS CONTINUED?
THE BIBLICAL EXTENSION IN TERMS
OF SEVEN AND SEVEN.
WE HAD HIGH REALTORS RATES FOR
20 TO 25 YEARS.
PERHAPS WE NEED LONGER THAN
SEVEN IN ORDER TO REBALANCE.
TOM COLE AND WITHIN A BIBLICAL
SPAN, WE HAVE NOT HAD A
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN LIKE THIS.
WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR PRISM OF
FINANCE AND ECONOMICS AND YOU
PUT IT OVER PRESIDENT CLINTON
ARE PRESIDENT TROMP, DO YOU HAVE
AN OPTIMISM THAT THEIR POLITICS
CAN DEAL WITH AMERICA'S
FINANCIAL REPRESSION?
BILL: I DON'T BECAUSE
GOVERNMENTS, TO MY WAY OF
THINKING, NEED SOME FISCAL
BALANCE ACTUALLY.
MONETARY AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT THE FISCAL SIDE
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW.
BERNANKE WAS THREE OR FOUR OR
FIVE YEARS AGO.
I THINK WE NEED TO SPEND MONEY,
BUT WE ARE NOT RELEASING THAT IN
JAPAN.
GERMANY IS A REALLY TIGHT SYSTEM
AND HAS A LAW THAT MAINTAINS A
FISCAL BALANCE BUDGET.
BOTH CLINTON AND TROMP ARE
INFLUENCED BY PREVAILING LOGIC
THAT SAYS YOU SHOULD TRY TO
BALANCE A BUDGET IN ORDER TO
SOLVE THE DEBT CRISIS.
I THINK THAT IS JUST THE WRONG
WAY TO DO IT.
I THINK WE NEED TO SPEND MONEY.
THE OTHER ALTERNATIVES ARE
INFRASTRUCTURE, ETC., ETC. 
BUT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO GET
IN THERE AND START WRITING
CHECKS AS OPPOSED TO THE PRIVATE
SECTOR, WHICH IS NOT.
MICHAEL AND REMEMBER BILL
CLINTON IN 1993 SAID HE WANTED
TO DIE AND COME BACK AS A BOND
MARKET BECAUSE THEY RUN
EVERYTHING?
YOU RUN EVERYTHING, THEREFORE,
BILL.
IF THEY WERE TO DO SOME SORT OF
PHYSICAL EFFORT, WHAT WOULD YOU
TELL PEOPLE IN CONGRESS WHO ARE
TERRIFIED THAT BY YIELDS ARE
GOING TO GO UP AND THAT WILL
COST US SO MUCH MONEY AND
TAXPAYERS WILL HAVE TO PICK UP
THE TAB AND IT IS A TERRIBLE
THING?
BILL: BOND YIELDS MIGHT GO UP TO
CERTAINLY ON THE LONGER AND AND
ON THE 10-YEAR END.
TO MY WAY OF THINKING,
REBALANCING OF THE FINANCIAL
SECTOR, YES, DOES THAT COST SOME
CORPORATIONS MONEY?
YES.
DOES THAT NARROW PROFIT MARGINS?
YES.
BUT TO MY WAY OF THINKING, THE
FED HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON WALL
STREET, HAS ALWAYS FOCUSED ON
WALL STREET AS OPPOSED TO MAIN
STREET.
NOT THAT THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT
MAIN STREET, BUT IT'S ABOUT TIME
THAT WAGES BECOME LESS OF A
FOCUS AND THAT OTHER DISTORTIONS
BECOME INTO PLAY.
THAT A SAVINGS IS JUSTIFIED BY
HIGHRIDGE OR STRAIGHTS.
TOM: WE WANT TO SHOW THE MARKET
REACTION.
HERE IS THE TWO-YEAR CHART I
SHOWED YOU.
THESE ARE ALL SAN FRANCISCO 49ER
LOSSES, ALL THE LAST SEASON.
I'M KIDDING.
THOSE ARE FOMC MEETINGS.
BILL COME I WANT TO SHOW THE
ABRUPT RETRACEMENT OF THE TWO
YEAR YIELD.
HERE WE SEE ENTHUSIASM WE HAVE
HAD OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF
MONTHS.
AND IT IS A MASSIVE REVERSAL.
-- REVERSAL IN THE TWO YEAR
YIELD.
MIKE: YOU OBVIOUSLY GET A
KNEE-JERK REACTION TO NUMBERS
LIKE THIS.
MIAMI LOOKING AT THE W.A.R. P,
FED FUNDS PROBABILITY OF A HIKE.
WE ARE DOWN TO A 4% CHANCE OF A
HIKE IN JUNE ACCORDING TO THIS.
AND ONLY 30% CHANCE IN JULY.
THOSE NUMBERS ARE STILL SEEING
-- R'S -- THOSE TWO NUMBERS ARE
TOO LOW FOR ME.
IN JULY, YOU SAY THE FED'S DAYS
ON TRACK.
MAYBE WE ARE HEADING INTO A
SLOWDOWN THAT WE SHOULD BE
AFRAID OF.
HE'LL: YOU COULD.
I'M WITH YOU IN TERMS OF THE
PROBABILITY FOR JULY.
I THINK IT IS 50% OR MORE.
BY LET'S GET BACK TO THE RECENT
ECONOMIC STATISTICS.
THE ATLANTA FED NOW SURVEY
BASICALLY SAYS WE ARE LOOKING A
2.8%, 2.9% REAL GDP QUARTER.
IF THE FED CANNOT RAISE INTEREST
RATES, THEN WHEN CAN THEY RAISE
INTEREST RATES?
SO TO MY WAY OF THINKING, THEY
MUST BACK UP WHAT THEY HAVEN'T
TALKING ABOUT FOR THE PAST FEW
MONTHS ABOUT THE NORMALIZING AND
TAKING GRADUAL'S THAT'S.
IF THEY DON'T COME ULTIMATELY,
THE MARKET BUBBLES EVEN MORE.
CURRENCIES BECOME EVEN MORE
DISTORTED.
AND IT'S NOT A HEALTHY STAGE FOR
CAPITAL.
MIKE: AS THE FED LOST
CREDIBILITY WITH THE MARKETS?
BILL: THEY HAVE BEGUN THE
JOURNEY.
LIKE I SAID, I THINK IT IS TO
THE ADVANTAGE OF A FINANCIAL
MARKETS AND CERTAINLY BANKS AND
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO WORK
WITH A POSITIVE YIELD CORE OF --
YIELD CURVE.
MARGINS DO BETTER WITH A STEEPER
CURVE.
I THINK THE FED WANTS TO TALK UP
SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES.
ULTIMATELY, THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW
THROUGH OR THEY LOSE
CREDIBILITY.
TOM: A VERY BALANCED REPORT, NOT
THE HYSTERIA THAT WE SEE IN
OTHER REPORTS.
HE SAYS A SERIES OF INCREASINGLY
NEGATIVE REVISIONS IS NOT A SIGN
OF LABOR MARKET HEALTH.
ONE OF HIS INSIGHTS THIS MONEY.
MICHAEL AND HE IS ALSO
SUGGESTING YOU THROW UP A
NUMBER.
PAYROLLS GO HAYWIRE ON OCCASION.
I'M WONDERING IF THE FED NEEDS
TO SAY SOMETHING HERE TO
REASSURE PEOPLE, TO GIVE FORWARD
GUIDANCE TO PEOPLE, THAT THEY
ARE STILL ON TRACK, SO THAT THEY
DON'T SEEM LIKE THEY ARE BEING
PUSHED AROUND BY MARKET
REACTION.
BILL: YES, I THINK YELLEN CAN
ADDRESS THIS SITUATION NEXT
WEEK.
THE 4.7% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.
IT BASICALLY FOLLOWS THE TAIL.
TO PRODUCE SOME TYPE OF REAL
INTEREST RATE, TO THE EXTENT
THAT IT IS A 4-7 YELLEN.
TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AND
BASICALLY CONTINUE TO SUGGEST A
HIKE IN JULY.
AND AN ADDITIONAL ONE IN
DECEMBER.
TOM: BILL, HOW CAN SHE DO THAT
WITH THE DOLLAR YEN SCREAMING
EVEN LOUDER.
MY A LOOKING AT GERMAN YIELDS
THAT ARE JAW-DROPPING.
A TWO-YEAR NEGATIVE YIELD,
NEGATIVE POINTS, 532%, DOESN'T
THAT OVERWHELM ANY RATIONAL
AMERICAN DISCUSSION?
BILL: NOT EXACTLY.
BECAUSE IT FITS THE GLOBAL
CENTRAL BANKER AND SETS THE
LEAD.
THERE IS EVIDENCE AND THERE HAS
BEEN, AND THERE HAS BEEN, FROM
EURO LAND, DESPITE THE WONDER WE
ALL WANT LOWER INTEREST RATES
AND HIGHER BLOSSOMS.
THESE NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES
ARE BEING DESTRUCTIVE IN MANY
WAYS.
I THINK IT SOME POINT, THEY HAVE
TO STOP, DESPITE WHAT DRAGHI HAS
SAID ABOUT WHATEVER IT TAKES.
AND IF HE CONTINUES, I THINK IT
SOME POINT, THE LOWER AND LOWER
SHORT-TERM RATES ON THE NEGATIVE
SIDE WOULD NOT BE DESTRUCTIVE
FOR A HIMALAYAN TO CRIME --
DECLINE.
TOM: BILL GROSS, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
GENEROUS OF YOU TO TAKE SUCH A
VERY LONG TIME WITH US.
I GO BACK TO THE HEADLINE.
JONATHAN: THANKS TO THE
BLOOMBERG RADIO TEAM.
A STUNNING JOBS NUMBER, THE
FEWEST JOBS ADDED IN ALMOST SIX
YEARS.
HERE'S THE MARKET REACTION.
TWO-YEAR YIELDS PLUMMET, SWITCH
UP THE BOARD, A STRONGER EURO UP
BY 1.3%.
GOLD CATCHES A HUGE BID.
WE WILL BREAK DOWN THE JOBS
REPORT 34 MINUTES AWAY.
JONATHAN: A STUNNING U.S. JOBS
REPORT, THE FEWEST JOBS ADDED TO
THE U.S. ECONOMY AND HIM SIX
YEARS.
HERE'S THE MARKET REACTION.
TO YEAR YIELD MUCH LOWER.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE
DOLLAR?
THE EURO-DOLLAR POPS HIGHER,
MUCH HIGHER, UP BY 1.22% ON THE
SESSION.
IT IS A MUCH WEAKER DOLLAR
STORY.
THAT IS THE BIGGEST ONE-DAY POP
SINCE MARCH.
BUT GOLD CATCHING A HUGE BID.
ONE QUESTION FOR THE MARKET --
IS JUNE REALLY THEY REALIZED
MEETING FOR THE FED?
♪
DAVID: 30 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE
OPENING BELL.
YOU JUST SAID IT JONATHAN, A
STUNNING JOBS NUMBER.
JONATHAN: I WONDER WHO IS
WRITING JANET YELLEN'S SPEECH
FOR MONDAY AND DO THEY JUST DO
THIS?
DAVID: WE WANT TO GO IMMEDIATELY
TO ERIK SCHATZKER.
TAKE US THROUGH IT AGAIN.
THERE IS NOT A LOT OF GOOD NEWS
IN THERE.
ERIK: AS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED IT,
A STUNNING MISS ON JOB CREATION
FOR THE MONTH OF MAY, JUST
38,000 JOBS CREATED.
THE ECONOMISTS WE SURVEYED WERE
LOOKING FOR 160,000, THE MEDIAN
ESTIMATE.
AND THE LOWEST ESTIMATE IN OUR
SURVEY, JUST TO ADD MORE
GRANULARITY TO IT, WAS 120,000.
A HUGE MESS.
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS LITTLE JOB
CREATION IN AMERICA SINCE
SEPTEMBER 2010.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN TO
4.7%.
BUT THAT IS NOT GOOD NEWS
BECAUSE YOU HAD PEOPLE LEAVING
THE LABOR FORCE.
OVER THE TWO-MONTH PERIOD, YOU
HAD 800,000 PEOPLE LEAVING THE
LABOR FORCE.
AND THAT DOES PUT DOWNWARD
PRESSURE ON THE UNEMPLOYED RATE.
AT THE SAME TIME, IT BRINGS THE
PARTICIPATION UP TO 2.6%.
AND THAT IS BACK DOWN TO
DECEMBER LEVELS.
WAGE GROWTH IS WHAT THING WE
HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR.
THAT SHOULD PORTEND FUTURE
INFLATION.
THAT CAME ON TARGET.
AVERAGE HOURS WORKED ALSO NOT
REALLY A POSITIVE, TICKING DOWN
TO 34.4 FROM 34.5.
VERY HARD TO LOOK AT THIS REPORT
WITH JOB LOSSES IN CONSTRUCTION
AND MINING AND LOGGING, FOR
EXAMPLE.
AND OF COURSE, THE 34,000 LOSS
IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND
INFORMATION.
WE BELIEVE THAT IS LARGELY FROM
THE VERIZON STRIKE.
IT IS HARD TO LOOK AT THIS
REPORT AND FIND MUCH THAT IS
POSITIVE, AN AUGER FOR A HIKE IN
JUNE.
DAVID: WHO ARE THE WINNERS AND
WHO ARE THE LOSERS?
LOOK AT MANUFACTURING AND
CONSTRUCTION ON THE ONE HAND.
ERIK: THE ONLY REAL WINNER WAS
HEALTH AND EDUCATION.
THERE WERE 67,000 JOBS CREATED
THERE.
I ONLY HAVE FOUR MONTHS OF DATA
TO GO BY.
BUT THAT IS 10,000 MORE THAN
FOUR MONTHS AGO.
SO THAT IS VERY STRONG JOB
CREATION.
AGAIN, MANUFACTURING DOWN BY
10,000.
MINING AND LOGGING DOWN BY
11,000.
CONSTRUCTION DOWN BY 15,000.
INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY, DOWN
BY 34,000.
I MENTIONED THERE IS A STRONG
BELIEF OR ANECDOTAL SUGGESTION
EVEN ON THE PART OF THE LABOR
DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THE RISE
AND STRIKE.
THE LET'S LOOK AT 34,000 ON TOP
OF THE 38 THOUSAND.
WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT ONLY
72,000 JOBS CREATED.
THAT, TOO, WOULD BE A
CATASTROPHIC MISS.
IN MATTER HOW YOU SLICE IT, THE
ECONOMY IS NOT CREATING AS MANY
JOBS AS IT HAS DONE IN THE PAST.
IT CREATED 29,000 JOBS ON
AVERAGE IN 2015.
YES, THAT PACE HAS SLOWED.
BUT IT HAS ALL FALLEN OFF A
CLIFF IN TERMS OF PACE FOR THIS
MONTH.
YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE
FODDER ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
THE LABOR PARTICIPATION RATE
AMONG VETERANS IS DOWN THIS
MONTH.
IT IS DOWN TO 50.4% FROM 50.7%.
THAT IMPORTANTLY, IT IS DOWN BY
MORE FOR GROWTH -- GULF WAR TO
VETERANS.
YOU CAN SAY THAT IS AN ANGRY
GROUP OF PEOPLE IF THEY CAN FIND
JOBS.
AND YOU ALSO SEE THE
PARTICIPATION RATE JOB PAYING
FOR PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE A
HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR COLLEGE
DEGREE.
DAVID COHEN THANK YOU.
JONATHAN: LOOK AT FEDERAL
RESERVE EXPECTATION.
THE POSSIBILITY OF A MOVE.
CURRENT IMPLIED PROBABILITY.
THIS IS FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE.
WE ARE AT 6%.
WE WERE TRADING IN THE 30'S
APPROACHING THAT NUMBER.
A REAL CALIBRATION OF
EXPECTATIONS.
JULY IS STILL HANGING IN THERE.
A STUNNING REVERSAL IN
EXPECTATIONS FOR A SUMMER MOVE
FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE.
JEFF RIFKIN STILL WITH US.
JEFF ROSENBERG JOINS US.
JEFF, EVERY YEAR, YIELDS MUST GO
HIGHER.
GUESS WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW.
JEFF: YEARS OF EXPECTING YIELDS
GOING HIGHER, WE HAVE LEARNED
OUR LESSONS AND WE ARE GOING TO
BE IN A LOW INTEREST RATE
ENVIRONMENT FOR A WHILE.
BUT ME TALK FOR A SECOND ON THE
REACTION.
I TAKE THIS AS AN OVERREACTION.
THERE ARE A LOT OF SPECIAL
FACTORS HERE.
CERTAINLY, IT IS A WEAKER POOR.
BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE A STEP BACK
AND APPRECIATE THAT WE EXPECT
PAYROLL GROWTH TO SLOW.
WHAT YOU ARE GETTING HERE IS
OUTSIZED SLOWING IN ONE MONTH
BECAUSE OF THE VERIZON STRIKE,
BECAUSE OF TEMP HELP, BECAUSE OF
MANUFACTURING, WHICH IS A
WEATHER-RELATED ISSUE.
LET'S NOT GO TO OVERBOARD ON HOW
WEEK THIS REPORT REALLY IS.
TO YOUR QUESTION, YES, THIS IS
CERTAINLY BY THE BOND MARKETS
AND PROBABILITIES -- THIS MAKES
IT JUNE -- MAKES JUNE A VERY
HIGH HURDLE FOR THE FED TO GO.
AND THE MARKETS ARE PRICING THAT
IN.
WE WILL GET CLAIRE FIXATION ON
THE SPEECH.
BUT IT IS GOING TO FOCUS ON THE
NEXT REPORT.
JONATHAN: MONDAY, JANET YELLEN
HAS A SPEECH TO MAKE.
HOW SHOULD SHE COMMUNICATE TO
THE MARKET ON MONDAY?
JEFF: WHAT SHE IS GOING TO
COMMUNICATE IS ABOUT THE LONGER
RUN TRAJECTORY AROUND THE
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LABOR
MARKETS.
NOT ABOUT ONE DATA POINT ON
FRIDAY, BUT OVER THE LONGER RUN
TRAJECTORY, WHICH INCLUDES THE
FACT THAT THE PACE OF
IMPROVEMENT CAN'T CONTINUE.
NOT BECAUSE OF THE DEMAND SIDE
OF THE ECONOMY.
THE KNEE-JERK REACTION IS THIS
IS A RECESSIONARY SIGNAL BECAUSE
WE ARE NOT EATING AS MANY JOBS.
BUT THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE
JOB MARKET.
ONE IS SUPPLY AND THE OTHERS
DEMAND.
WE ARE SEEING CONSTRAINTS ON THE
SUPPLY SIDE.
I THINK SHE CAN EMPHASIZE THAT.
THE OTHER THING MISSING HERE IS
THAT WE HAVE SEEN WAGE GROWTH.
AND YOU ARE SEEING THE
STRENGTHENING IN THE WAGE
PICTURE.
THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS THE
ATLANTA FED WAGE TRACKER, WHICH
IS THE BEST INDICATOR FOR
TRACKING WE JUST.
BETTER THAN WHAT WE ARE SEEING
IN THAT EA CHIEF.
SHE WILL HIGHLIGHT THOSE PIECES
TO MAKE A CASE FOR AN EVENTUAL
THE GRADUAL INCREASE IN
NORMALIZATION.
DAVID: THIS ACTUALLY HELPS ARE A
BIT, SAYING WE DID NOT OVERREACT
ON THE UPSIDE.
AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO
OVERREACT ON THE DOWNSIDE.
JEFF: IT DOES.
I THINK THEY TRULY WERE GOING TO
DELAY UNTIL THEY GET THROUGH
BREXIT ANYWAY.
SHE'S GOT SOMETHING TO TALK
ABOUT, WAGES, UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
COMING DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY -- 
MEGAN: THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE
HAVE LEFT THE LABOR FORCE.
IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF JOB
INCREASES, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE
LEAVING.
JEFF: IF YOU GO BACK 12 YEARS
NOW, MAYBE IT'S 15, WHEN THE
LABOR DEPARTMENT DID A STUDY ON
WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN FOR THE
PARTICIPATION RATE, IT HAS DONE
THAT.
WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION AND
THESE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE
WORKFORCE.
IT MEANS YOU HAVE A HEIGHT
SITUATION THAN YOU MIGHT HAVE
OTHERWISE.
AND IT'S NOT THAT PEOPLE ARE
LEAVING BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL
DISAPPOINTED.
THEY ARE LEAVING BECAUSE THEY
ARE RETIRING.
MEGAN: AND WE HAVE DONE A WELL
JOB POINTING OUT THE POSITIVE
POINTS IN THIS REPORT.
BUT 50,000 JOBS LOWER THAN EVEN
THE MOST PESSIMISTIC FORECAST.
THE HUGE SPLIT WE SEE IN THIS
ECONOMY BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE
LOWER EDUCATION LEVELS IN PEOPLE
WHO HAVE HIGHER EDUCATION
LEVELS, HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE
THROUGH THAT AND STILL GET A
PICTURE OF A SUSTAINABLE
RECOVERY AND AN EXPANDING
RECOVERY?
THAT IS A BIG CHALLENGE FOR HER.
JEFF: IT IS HARD TO DO WITHOUT
FISCAL HELP.
WE ARE ASKING THE FED TO DO WITH
TOO MUCH YEAR.
I LOOK AT THE NONSEASONALLY
ADJUSTED NUMBERS TO SEE WHAT IS
REALLY GOING ON.
THIS MONTH, WE ADDED 650,000 NET
JOBS TO THE WORKFORCE.
THAT IS BELOW THE HISTORICAL
NUMBER THAT HAS BEEN AROUND
900,000.
THIS IS GETTING ADJUSTED, SIX
HUNDRED 50,000 IS GETTING
ADJUSTED TO 38,000.
THAT IS A PRETTY BIG -- I THINK
WE ARE SEEING A VERY BIG CHANGE
IN THE PATTERN OF HIRING AND
FIRING.
AND THESE NUMBERS, FOR PEOPLE TO
BE ADDING THE VERIZON STRIKE TO
THE SEASONALLY ADJUSTED NUMBER
MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.
JONATHAN KONG I WANT TO BRING
THE ATTENTION OF OUR VIEWERS ON
WHAT IS HAPPENING THE BOND
MARKET.
TREASURY YIELDS, -11 BASIS
POINTS.
AND WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE
10, WE ARE DOWN NINE BASIS
POINTS ON THE U.S. 10 YEAR YIELD
THAT 1.71%.
A RALLY ON BONDS AS WELL.
JUST SEVEN BASIS POINTS ON YOUR
YIELD ON THE 10 YEAR.
JEFF ROSENBERG, THIS IS YOUR
WORLD.
IT IS A GLOBAL STORY.
BUT IT IS A U.S. DOMESTIC STORY
AS WELL.
EVERY TIME IT TAKES HIGHER, YOU
GET A DATA POINT LIKE THIS THAT
PUSHES ALL -- PUSHES US ALL BACK
AGAIN.
WILL WE CONTINUE TO BE
WHIPSAWED?
JEFF: YOU BRING UP TWO PARTS TO
THAT.
THIS MORNING AS A DOMESTIC
STORY.
IT IS ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS ON
THE FED.
LOOKING ACROSS A GLOBAL YIELDS,
IT IS ABOUT THE GLOBAL STORY IN
TERMS OF LOW INTEREST RATES.
SO YESTERDAY WAS ABOUT ECB AND
DRAGHI AND EXPECTATIONS AROUND
QE.
AND WHAT YOU ARE SEEING ON THE
LONG TREND OF GLOBAL INTEREST
RATE YIELD CURVES IS FOR THE
PRESSURE DOWNWARD.
WHERE WILL FURTHER EXPANSION AND
QE COME FROM?
SO PERSPECTIVE TO THE LONG-TERM
YIELDS IN THE U.S., IT IS A
GLOBAL STORY.
THE HIGH-YIELDING INSTRUMENT,
THESE YIELDS LOOK VERY LOW.
BUT ON A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE,
THEY ARE ACTUALLY VERY HIGH AND
THAT DRAWS IN GLOBAL INVESTMENTS
OF THE BACK END OF THE YIELD
CURVE FOR INVESTORS WHO ARE
LOOKING FOR PLACES WHERE THEY
CAN GET AWAY FROM NEGATIVE
INTEREST RATES.
IN THAT ENVIRONMENT, DESPITE THE
SPEECH THAT JANET YELLEN MAY OR
MAY NOT GIVE, YOU HAD THIS
BACKDROP THAT COME IN THE REST
OF THE WORLD, WE ARE NOT HAVING
THIS DEBATE OVER NORMALIZATION.
WE ARE HAVING A DIFFERENT
DEBATE.
THE DEBATE ABOUT HOW MUCH MORE
COMMENDATION CAN YOU GET.
DAVID: HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU
CAN NICELY WHAT IS GOING HERE?
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IS THE PATH
WE ARE ON TO SOME EXTENT.
JEFF: ABSOLUTELY.
YOU CAN'T ISOLATE IT.
WE FOCUS ON ONE THING AT ONE
TIME.
SO THIS MORNING, IT IS ABOUT THE
U.S. AND THE FRONT END OF THE
YIELD CURVE IS RUNNING THE
RALLY.
BUT THE ATTENTIONAL THAT THAT
DELAYS THE'S -- THE GROWTH OF
THE FED, SO BE IT.
YESTERDAY, IT WAS ABOUT THE
GLOBAL FACTORS PUSHING BACK INTO
THE U.S..
DAVID: YES.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR STAYING ON WITH
US.
BIG NEWS ON JOBS NUMBERS.
WE WILL -- WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO
TALK ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO THE
JOBS NUMBERS.
WHAT THEY MEAN, THE IMPACT ON
THE MARKETS AND BE ON MARKETS,
WHAT THEY REALLY MEAN FOR OUR
ECONOMY.
JONATHAN: A STUNNING JOBS
REPORT.
HERE'S THE REACTION ON THE
MARKET.
NO DRAMA ON THE FUTURES MARKET.
15 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE CASH
OPEN.
HERE IS THE DRAMA.
TWO-YEAR YIELDS GO LOWER, MUCH
LOWER, DOWN BY 12 BASIS ONCE TO
0.77%.
A REAL CALIBRATION AGAIN OF WHAT
THE FED MAY OR MAY NOT DO THIS
SUMMER JUNE IS LIVE IS THE CATCH
PHRASE.
WE WILL BRING YOU REACTION FROM
OUR GUESTS.
HERE'S THE REACTION IN THE FX
MARKET.
YOUR-DOLLAR, 31.13, UP 1.61%
.
THE BIGGEST ONE-DAY POP SINCE
MARCH.
SOME BIG MOVES IN THIS MARKET ON
THE BACK OF THAT VERY
DISAPPOINTING HEADLINE NUMBER,
DAVID.
DAVID: YOU SAID IT.
IT IS STUNNING.
WE WILL GET BACK TO THAT JOBS
NUMBER.
WE ARE JOINED NOW BY STEPHEN
ENGLE UNDER, HEAD OF GLOBAL G 10
FX STRATEGY.
STEPHEN, WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM
YOU YET.
GIVE US YOUR INITIAL REACTION TO
THESE NUMBERS.
STEPHEN: THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY MUCH
WEAKER THAN THE MARKET EXPECTED.
WITH THE DOWNWARD REVISION,
MAKING A JUNE HIKE ARE UNLIKELY,
WE KNOW THESE NUMBERS ARE
ERRATIC.
THE SEASONALITY COULD HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT, SUMMER
JOB CREATION.
IN THE PAST, IF YOU LOOK AT THE
HISTORY OF THE DEVIATION OF
ACTUAL EMPLOYMENT FROM 12-MONTH
MOVING AVERAGES, THESE BIG
SHOCKS, SOMETIMES THEY TELL YOU
THAT THINGS ARE TURNING.
MOST OF THE TIMES, THEY TELL YOU
IT IS A DATA ERROR.
BUT IT IS NOT STOPPING THE
MARKET FROM TAKING IT SERIOUSLY.
THE MARKET SEEMS TO BE SOMEWHAT
SURE EUROS.
EQUITIES ARE DOWN.
THE EURO IS THE BIG WINNER ON
THIS.
AND WHEN THE CHIPS FALL ON THE
EQUITY MARKET, IT IS PROBABLY
NOT THAT POSITIVE FOR E.M..
DAVID: I TAKE YOUR POINT IS ONE
DATA POINT.
SO HELP US.
AS POTENTIAL INVESTORS, HELP US
DO THAT.
WHAT DO WE DO NEXT UP WITH THIS
IN PERSPECTIVE AND KNOW THAT
THIS IS REALLY A DOWN TORN -- A
DOWNTURN ARE JUST A BLIP?
STEPHEN: PART OF THE REASON THAT
THE FORECAST WAS SO CONSECRATED
IN THE 140 TO 160 RANGE IS THAT
NONE OF THE USUAL INDICATORS
WERE TELLING YOU THAT THERE WAS
AN IMMINENT COLLAPSE IN
EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITY.
SO YOU WOULD LOOK FOR SOME
CONFIRMATION OR CONTRADICTION
FROM INITIAL CLAIMS, FROM SOME
OF THESE OTHER INDICATORS THAT
COME IN.
AND OBVIOUSLY, GETTING TWO 38S
IN A ROW WOULD BE MUCH MORE
MEANINGFUL.
THESE NUMBERS ARE BY NATURE
ERRATIC AND WE TEND TO TAKE THEM
AS IF THEY ARE GOSPEL, BUT THEY
ARE NOT.
JONATHAN: I WAS REMINDED MONTHS
AGO THAT, IN 2000 FOUR, THE FED
STILL MADE THE MOVE, STILL
HEIGHT INTEREST-RATE.
CAN YOU TELL ME WHY THIS IS SO
DIFFERENT THIS TIME VERSUS
PREVIOUS FED TIGHTENING CYCLES?
STEPHEN: I THINK IN 2004, THEY
HAD MORE CONFIDENCE THAT THE
RECOVERY WAS GOING AND INFLATION
WAS BEGINNING TO PICK UP.
IF YOU LOOK IN -- IF YOU LISTEN
TO THE FED SPEAKERS, THEY WERE
ALREADY CONCERNED ABOUT EUROPEAN
POLITICS.
THERE WERE ENOUGH SPEAKERS TO
RULE YESTERDAY.
NONE OF THEM ARE IN ANY HURRY TO
HIDE.
SO WHY HIKE WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A
WEEK NUMBER?
MEGAN: I WANT TO BRING YOU IN ON
THIS.
WHAT IS JANET YELLEN'S
COMMUNICATION STRATEGY GOING TO
BE ON THIS?
AND HOW IS SHE GOING TO -- AS WE
SAID, SHE IS SPEAKING ON MONDAY
-- HOW DOES SHE COMMUNICATE HER
PATH FORWARD?
JEFF: COMMUNICATION HAS ALWAYS
BEEN ABOUT DATA.
-- DATA DEPENDENCE.
IF THEY ARE TRAINED TO RAISE
EXPECTATIONS IN THE MARKETS FOR
THEIR NEXT MOVE, THEY DON'T WANT
TO SURPRISE THE MARKET.
THEY WILL HAVE TO CLEARLY
ACKNOWLEDGE THE DISAPPOINTMENT
OF ONE REPORT.
BUT IT IS EVEN HIGHLIGHTED.
IT IS ONE REPORT.
SO I THINK WE WILL PUT THAT
REPORT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE
LONGER-TERM IMPROVEMENT YOU HAVE
SEEN IN THE LABOR MARKETS.
AND PERHAPS THE ADVANTAGE OF
THAT ILLUSTRATE THE
DATA-DEPENDENT BUILDING, WHICH
DOES NOT MEAN ATTENDANCE ON THE
LAST DAY.
MEGAN: WE HAVE TALKED ALL
MORNING ABOUT JUNE BEING OFF THE
TABLE.
BUT HOW DO WE GET MORE TO TWO
HIKES?
ARE WE STILL LOOKING AT A LIVE
JULY?
JEFF: THE PROBABLY'S HAVE GONE
DOWN.
JONATHAN HIGHLIGHTED IT EARLIER
IN THE PROGRAM.
YOU CAN CERTAINLY GET TWO HIKES
BECAUSE YOU HAVE JULY.
THE ALSO HAVE SEPTEMBER.
AND THEN EXPECTATIONS AS YOU
PAUSE AROUND THE ELECTION, YOUR
SECOND HIKE IS IN DECEMBER.
SO I THINK THE TWO SCENARIO HERE
IS LIVE.
WHEN WE GET MORE DATA POINTS FOR
SEPTEMBER.
PERHAPS IT PULLS JULY BACK.
BUT WE WILL SEE.
JONATHAN: CITIGROUP WILL NOT
LIKE ME DOING THIS.
BUT SAY YOU ARE THE FED CHAIR IN
PHILADELPHIA ON MONDAY.
IT IS EXPECTATIONS FOR A RATE
HIKE.
RARELY HAS IT REVERSED IN A
MATTER OF MONTHS.
AND NOW IT IS REVERSING AGAIN.
WHAT IS YOUR COMMUNICATION
STRATEGY?
STEPHEN: I THINK YOU HAVE
TO LEAVE IT OPEN.
AS JEFF WAS SAYING, WE HAD SIX
YEARS WHERE THE EMPLOYMENT
GROWTH WAS BASICALLY 200,000.
I THINK YOU WOULD PUT IT INTO
CONTEXT.
IT COULD SUGGEST THAT THINGS ARE
FALLING APART, BUT IS NOT THE
ONLY THING YOU WILL BE LOOKING
AT.
I THINK JULY IS STILL ALIVE.
RIGHT NOW, FED FUNDS DOES NOT
HAVE A WHOLE HIGH-PRICED IN FOR
CALENDAR 2016.
SO THERE IS A LOT OF PESSIMISM
AND THE MARKET AND THAT MIGHT BE
OVERDONE AT THIS STAGE.
YOU WOULD THINK THAT SHE WOULD
TRY TO HAVE SOME BALANCE.
JONATHAN: SO JUNE IS DEAD.
LONG LIVE JULY.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
STAY WITH US AS WE COUNT DOWN TO
THE U.S. OPEN 
♪
MEGAN: WELCOME BACK.
WE ARE STILL HERE TALKING WITH
JEFF ROSENBAUM, TALKING ABOUT
THIS STUNNING JOBS REPORT WE
HAVE SEEN.
WE DO HAVE ONE LITTLE BRIGHT
SPOT, WHICH IS THAT WAGES CAME
IN AT 0.2% UP.
HOW MUCH ARE WE GOING TO SEE
THOSE WAGES CONTINUE TO RISE?
GIVEN THAT WE HAVE YET TO SEE AN
ACTUAL DATA POINT, BUT
POTENTIALLY A STALLING OF THAT
HUGE SURGE IN THE LABOR MARKET?
JEFF: IT IS A GOOD WAY TO FRAME
THE CONVERSATION.
IT IS ONE DATA POINT.
WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE TOO MUCH
OUT OF THE ONE DATA POINT WHERE
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN WAGES FOR
SOME TIME NOW IS A GRADUAL
STRENGTHENING.
THAT IS TELLING YOU ABOUT THE
TIMING OF THE LABOR MARKET.
AND HERE IS AN IMPORTANT POINT.
YOU CAN HAVE SLOW DOWN IN
HEADLINE PAYROLL GROWTH AND THAT
IS NOT A RECESSIONARY SIGNAL.
THE POINT IS THAT WE SHOULD
EXPECT A SLOWDOWN GOOD THE LABOR
MARKET IS TIGHTENING.
BUT IT IS TIGHTENING BECAUSE OF
THE SUPPLY SIDE.
THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY AN
INDICATION OF THE DEMAND SIDE.
WHAT WAGES OR TELL YOU ABOUT IS
THE TIGHTNESS OF THE LABOR
MARKET.
YOU ARE NOW STARTING TO FINALLY
SEE THAT.
WHAT WE EXPECT OUT OF JANET
YELLEN ON MONDAY IN TERMS OF THE
SPEECH, THINK SHE WILL FOCUS ON
THAT TIGHTENING TO THE LABOR
MARKET AND THE WAGE PICTURE AND
LESS ON THE HEADLINE "BIG
DISAPPOINTMENT HERE THIS
MORNING."
JONATHAN: IF YOU JUST TUNED IN,
38 THOUSAND IS THE NUMBER, THE
FEWEST IN ALMOST SIX YEARS, A
BIG DOWNS SIDES OF RISE ON THE
HEADLINE NUMBER.
BIG MOVES IN THIS MARKET.
THE MARKET OPENED ABOUT FOUR
MINUTES WAY.
I'VE GOT TO SAY THOUGH, NO MORE
DRAMA IN THE FUTURES MARKET
RIGHT HERE.
EQUITY FUTURES LOWER.
BUT A THIRD OF 1% ON THE DOW,
THE MARKET OPENS NEXT ON
BLOOMBERG.
JONATHAN: THIS IS BLOOMBERG GO.
A BIG DOWNSIDE SURPRISE FOR THE
JOBS NUMBERS.
IT COMES OUT AT 38,000 JOBS.
WE WERE LOOKING FOR 160.
DOWN FUTURES DOWN ABOUT ONE
THIRD.
CHECK OUT THE EUROZONE, DOWN BY
SEVEN TENTHS OF 1%.
SWITCH UP THE BOARD.
IT IS THE EURO, A MUCH STRONGER
EURO.
THERE IT IS, UP 1.4% ON THE
EURO.
STRONGER EURO STORY.
CABLE UP 145.
JUST AN EPIC RALLY IN
TREASURIES.
TREASURIES SURGERY -- SURGING.
CRUDE IS DOING ITS THING, A
LITTLE SOFTER.
LET'S GET THESE MARKETS OPEN.
25 SECONDS INTO THE SESSION.
LET'S GO BACK TO ABIGAIL
DOOLITTLE.
ABIGAIL: WE ARE LOOKING AT A
WEAKER OPEN FOR U.S. STOCKS
AFTER THAT TAKES MAINLY BAD
PAYROLL, THE WORST IN SIX YEARS.
A LITTLE BIT OF A RECOVERY OFF
OF THE PREMARKET LOWS.
THE S&P FUTURES, WE DO SEE A
SHARP DROP-OFF AFTER -- RIGHT
HERE.
WE SEE THIS AFTER THE NONFARM
PAYROLLS WAS ANNOUNCED.
THE QUESTION WILL BE WHETHER WE
SEE A RECOVERY AS THE DAY MOVES
ON AS INVESTORS START TO PRICE
IN THE POSSIBILITY OF A
RIGHT-DELAY.
THE POSSIBILITY OF A DELAY, THE
FINANCIALS OF ALL THE BIG BANKS,
WELLS FARGO AND JPMORGAN DOWN
SHARPLY.
THEY MAKE MONEY ON LENDING.
WE HAVE THE SHARES OF UNION
PACIFIC TRADING HIGHER HERE ON
MARKET OPEN.
GOLDMAN WAS RAISED TO A BUY.
A 20% UPSIDE POTENTIAL FOR DEERE
.
UNION PACIFIC WAS UPGRADED TO AN
OVERWEIGHT.
HERE IS WHAT IS HAPPENING.
MEGAN: WE TURN NOW TO WALMART,
THE COMPANIES -- COUNTRY'S
BIGGEST RABBIT EMPLOYER.
IT IS HOLDING A SHAREHOLDER
MEETING IN ARKANSAS.
SHANNON, WALMART HAS BEEN ONE OF
THE COMPANIES THAT HAS FIVE
PUBLIC BATTLES WITH EMPLOYEES
OVER WAGES, WHAT PRICE THEY
SHOULD PUT THEM AT.
WITH A $50 MINIMUM TRYING TO BE
PUSHED THROUGH.
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THIS
BATTLE WILL BE TALKED ABOUT
TODAY?
>> THE COMPANY IS VERY PROUD OF
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE ON WAGES.
THEY SAY THAT IS HELPING IMPROVE
THE QUALITY OF THEIR STORES AND
CUSTOMER SERVICE.
ONE OF THE THINGS THE CEO HAS
BEEN TOUTING AND SAYING HE HAS
SEEN THE BENEFITS OF INCREASED
WAGERS.
THERE IS A FLIPSIDE OF WHEN
WAGES GO UP FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES,
THAT MEANS PEOPLE HAVE MORE
MONEY IN THEIR POCKET THAT THEY
CAN SPEND.
WAGES, EVEN IF THEY GO UP, THAT
CAN BE A POSITIVE THING FOR
WALMART.
MEGAN: WE HAVE SEEN A STUNNING
JOBS REPORT WITH ONLY 38,000
PEOPLE ADDED TO THE WORKFORCE,
THE LOWEST NUMBER IN SIX YEARS.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WALMART, HOW
DIFFICULT DO THINK IT IS FOR
THEM TO CONTINUE TO REFRESH
THEIR OWN WORKFORCE?
>> IT IS REALLY INTERESTING
BECAUSE AS THE LABOR MARKET
TIGHTENED, A LOT OF EMPLOYERS AT
THE LOWER END OF THE PAY SCALE
HAD DIFFICULTY RECRUITING.
AS THE MARKET TIGHTENS, A WILL
GET EASIER FOR THEM TO HIRE
PEOPLE AT THE LOWER WAGE AND.
THERE IS AN INTERESTING FLIPSIDE
TO THIS NEGATIVE JOBS NUMBER FOR
WALMART.
IT NEVER LOOKS GOOD FOR A
COMPANY WHEN PEOPLE ARE OUT OF
WORK AND HAVE LESS MONEY IN
THEIR POCKET, BUT WALMART HAS
HISTORICALLY DONE WELL IN A DOWN
MARKET.
EARLIER THIS YEAR, THEIR STOCK
DID WELL WHEN THERE WERE ALL OF
THESE JITTERS.
THEIR STOCK IS NOT DOWN THAT
MUCH TODAY.
COMPANY -- AS PEOPLE SEE WAGES
GO DOWN, THEY TRADE DOWN.
THEY LOOK FOR RETAILERS LIKE
WALMART, DOLLAR GENERAL, RATHER
THAN TARGET, NORDSTROM.
MEGAN: MAYBE GOOD FOR WALMART.
THANK YOU.
DAVID: WE ARE GOING TO TURN BACK
TO THIS JOBS REPORT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
WE JUST LEARNED ABOUT THIS A
LITTLE OVER AN HOUR AGO.
WE WERE VERY SURPRISED.
WE DID NOT EXPECT THIS NUMBER.
WHERE U.S. SURPRISED AS WE WORK?
>> THIS IS BELOW EXPECTATIONS.
I EXPECTED THERE WOULD BE IMPACT
FROM THE VERIZON STRIKE.
THAT IS WHY I CALLED THEM TO OR
THREE WEEKS AGO AND SAID WE NEED
TO RESOLVE THIS.
YOUR WORKERS AND FAMILIES ARE
SUFFERING, THE COMPANY
SUFFERING, THE ECONOMY IS
SUFFERING.
A BIG PART OF WHAT WE SAW IN
THIS REPORT WAS THE IMPACT OF
THAT STRIKE.
I EXPECT TO SEE THAT RECOVERY IN
THE FOLLOWING MONTHS.
DAVID: FAIR POINT.
BUT THAT IS ABOUT 35,000 JOBS.
THE EXPECTATION WAS FOR AS MANY
AS 160,000.
IF YOU TAKE THAT OUT, YOU ARE
STILL WAY SHORT.
>> THAT IS THE DIRECT IMPACT.
THAT WAS THE ESTIMATE OF THE
DIRECT IMPACT.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
MULTIPLIER EFFECT IS, OTHER
BUSINESSES THAT GET IMPACTED BY
THIS.
AT THE SAME TIME, THE REPORT WAS
BELOW EXPECTATIONS.
I LOOK AT THE BROADER PICTURE.
WE HAVE HAD ROUGHLY EIGHT
REPORTS SINCE THE RECOVERY WHERE
WE WERE UNDER 100,000.
YOU LOOK AT ONE MONTH AND IT
DOES NOT MAKE A TREND.
WHAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO DO IS
LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE.
OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS, WE
HAVE SEEN ABOUT 100 60,000 JOBS
A YEAR.
THAT IS AN APPLE LEVEL OF JOBS
-- AN AMPLE NUMBER OF JOBS.
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IS A
TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF
JOBS AND WAGE GROWTH.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT AVERAGE WAGE
GROWTH RIGHT NOW, IT IS 2.3%
ANNUALIZED.
WE ARE SEEING WAGE GROWTH.
THAT IS A GOOD SIGN.
THEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER
BELLWETHERS, AND YOU DON'T JUST
LOOK AT ONE DATA POINT.
FIRST-TIME CLAIMS FOR
UNEMPLOYMENT, THOSE ARE AT
HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS.
WE HAVE 65 WEEKS BELOW 300,000.
WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT SINCE 1973.
AUTO SALES, LOOK AT CONSUMER
SPENDING, THOSE THINGS ARE UP.
WHEN I LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF
THE CIRCUMSTANCES, WAS THIS
REPORT BELOW EXPECTATIONS?
YES IT WAS.
IS THE VERIZON STRIKE PART OF
IT?
ABSOLUTELY.
DO WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO?
ABSOLUTELY.
THAT IS WHY WE ADVOCATE FOR
THINGS LIKE WAGING THE MINIMUM
WAGE.
MORE INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING,
BECAUSE WE HAD AN INFRASTRUCTURE
BILL LAST FALL, BUT WE NEED TO
DO MORE.
THERE IS MORE WORK TO DO.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BIGGER
PICTURE, THERE ARE REALLY SOUND
FUNDAMENTALS HERE.
JONATHAN: THERE IS A WORD IN THE
U.K. THAT IS USED A LOT, IT IS
SPIN.
I'M HEARING SPIN HERE.
WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS TREND, WE
JUST HAD AN UGLY 38,000.
I TAKE YOUR POINT ON WAGES.
THIS IS A SOFT REPORT.
THE LAST ONE WAS SOFT, TOO.
WHAT IS THE TREND, THREE MONTHS,
SIX MONTHS?
>> 65 WEEKS IN A ROW UNDER
300,000 FIRST-TIME CLAIMS FOR
UNEMPLOYMENT.
THAT IS A TREND.
75 MONTHS IN A ROW OF
PRIVATE-SECTOR JOB GROWTH, THAT
IS A TREND.
AUTO SALES CONTINUING TO BE AT
RECORD LEVELS.
LAST YEAR WAS THE BEST YEAR
EVER.
THAT IS A TREND.
WE SEE A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING
HERE THAT DEMONSTRATE THAT WE
ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION.
WE HAVE UNFINISHED BUSINESS.
THERE IS NOBODY HERE SPIKING THE
FOOTBALL, PUTTING UP MISSION
ACCOMPLISHED SENSE, WE HAVE MORE
WORK TO DO.
THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THE TOP OF
THE MONTH, AND THIS IS TRUE IN
EVERY RECOVERY, THE SMALLER
STEPS YOU WILL TAKE IN JOB
GROWTH.
LOOK AT PRIOR RECOVERIES, WE SAW
THAT.
AT THE SAME TIME, YOU WILL START
TO SEE WAGE GROWTH.
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE.
THOSE ARE THE TRADE-OFFS YOU
HAVE WHEN YOU ARE GETTING
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND RECOVERY AT
THIS STAGE WE ARE CURRENTLY AT.
JONATHAN: LET'S TALK ABOUT
PREVIOUS RECOVERY.
2.5% IS A DROP IN THE OCEAN
CONSIDERING WHERE WE WERE WITH
WAGE GROWTH IN PREVIOUS
RECOVERIES.
IMPLEMENT AT 4.7%.
YOU TALK ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN AND
HOW WE ARE CREEPING TO THE TOP.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING
ABOUT FALLING DOWN THE OTHER
SIDE.
I WONDER IF THIS ECONOMY HAS
LOST MOMENTUM.
THE TREND SEEMS TO BE POPPING
OUT A LITTLE BIT.
ARE WE LOOKING AT A ECONOMY THAT
LOST MOMENTUM?
>> I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT
THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE.
OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS, WE
HAVE 150,000 JOBS A MONTH.
WE NEED ABOUT 175,000 JOBS A
MONTH TO SUSTAIN THE CURRENT
LEVEL.
YOU LOOK AT FIRST-TIME CLAIMS
FOR UNEMPLOYMENT, SO THAT IS ONE
OF THE MOST RELIABLE PREDICTORS.
WE HAVE 5.8 MILLION JOB OPENINGS
RIGHT NOW.
IN THE RECESSION, THERE WERE
SEVEN JOBSEEKERS FOR EVERY
OPENING, NOW WE HAVE 1.4 SEEKERS
FOR EVERY OPENING.
WE NEED TO WORK ON LABOR FORCE
PARTICIPATION.
THE IRONY OF THOSE WHO CRITICIZE
LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE
ARE THOSE PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE
EFFORTS TO PUT IN PLACE 21ST
CENTURY PAY POLICIES.
WE KNOW HOW WE CAN INCREASE
LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION, THAT
IS DOING WHAT THE REST OF THE
WORLD DOES.
HAVING A SENSIBLE FEDERAL PAY
FREEZE POLICY SO WE WOULD BE
LIKE CANADA AND GERMANY AND
OTHER COUNTRIES WHOSE FEMALE
LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE
ARE HIGHER THAN OURS BECAUSE
THEIR PUBLIC POLICY REFLECTS
THIS.
WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO.
FOLKS IN THE REPUBLICAN
LEADERSHIP DON'T WANT TO WAGE --
RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE.
MEGAN: YOU SAID NO ONE IS
SPIKING THE FOOTBALL.
THIS WEEK WE SAW THE PRESIDENT
TOUTS HIS ECONOMIC RECORD OF THE
MINISTRATION.
TWO DAYS LATER, WE SEE A LABOR
MARKET REPORT THAT INDICATES
SEVERE WEAKNESS ACROSS SEVERAL
SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY.
HOW DO YOU ESCAPE THE FACT THAT
IT SEEMS LIKE MOMENTUM AND RISK
IS TO THE DOWNSIDE?
>> EVERY MONTH, IT IS FUNNY, I
RECALL.
WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID IS TALK
ABOUT WHERE WE WERE WHEN WE TOOK
OFFICE.
WE WERE LOSING 2.4 MILLION JOBS
IN THE MONTHS BEFORE HE TOOK
OFFICE.
75 MONTHS IN A ROW OF
PRIVATE-SECTOR JOB GROWTH.
WE HAVE SEEN THE AUTO INDUSTRY.
THEY WERE ON LIFE SUPPORT, AND
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP SAID
PULLED THE PLUG.
THEN HE TALKED ABOUT WHERE WE
NEED TO GO.
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE
CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE
UNFINISHED BUSINESS WHICH IS TO
MAKE SURE THAT THE WIND AT OUR
BACK RESULTS IN SHARED
PROSPERITY FOR EVERYONE AND NOT
SIMPLY PROSPERITY FOR THOSE AT
THE TOP.
JONATHAN: YOU MAKE A FANTASTIC
POINT.
I WANT TO WRAP THIS UP.
IF THE TREND AND THE MOMENTUM IS
SO GOOD, WHY HAS THE FED ONLY
BEEN ABLE TO HIKE RATES ONCE?
>> WE DON'T COMMENT ON THAT
POLICY.
EVERY TIME I GET ASKED THAT,
I'VE LEAVE THAT TO THE FED.
WE CONTACTED THE VERIZON STRIKE
WORKERS, WE BROUGHT THEM TO THE
TABLE.
WE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR
RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE.
PASSING SENSIBLE PAID LEAVE
POLICIES.
ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE
SPENDING, THESE ARE THE THINGS
THAT WILL CREATE MORE JOBS AND
PUT MONEY IN PEOPLE'S POCKETS.
WHEN PEOPLE HAVE MONEY IN THEIR
POCKETS, THEY SPEND IT.
THAT HELPS THE ECONOMY.
WHAT I HEAR FROM BUSINESSES ALL
THE TIME, THEY SAY THEY NEED
MORE CUSTOMERS.
ONE OF THE BEST WAY TO GET
CUSTOMERS IS TO PUT MONEY IN
PEOPLE'S POCKETS.
DAVID: I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR
BEING WITH US.
IT STRIKES ME THAT WHEN SENIOR
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, DURING
DIFFICULT DAYS, IT IS
PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL.
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
>> IT IS ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
JONATHAN: EQUITIES OPENED A
LITTLE BIT LOWER.
WE WILL WRAP IT ALL UP.
WE WILL BE TALKING TO BLOOMBERG
INTELLIGENCE AND JEFF ROSENBERG
OF BLACKROCK.
THE CONVERSATION ON THE PAYROLL
REPORT CONTINUES ON BLOOMBERG
GO.
♪
♪
DAVID: THIS IS BLOOMBERG GO.
CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR, OUT
OTHER WILL BE UP NEXT.
♪
JONATHAN: THIS IS BLOOMBERG GO.
WE ARE 15 MINUTES INTO THE
SESSION.
AN INTERESTING SESSION TO SAY
THE LEAST.
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
FEATURES WERE NEGATIVE GOING
INTO THE OPEN.
THIS IS HOW WE STAND.
THE S&P 500 DOWN .5%.
THE DOW DOWN .5%.
IN THE WIDER MARKET, A REAL MOVE
WITH YIELDS GRINDING LOW.
10 YEAR YIELDS DOWN.
A WEAKER DOLLAR.
CARL RICCADONNA FROM BLOOMBERG
INTELLIGENCE AND JEFF ROSENBERG
FROM BLACKROCK.
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE CAR OF?
CARL: THE MIDYEAR RATE HIKES
TOOK A BIG STEP TOWARDS JULY.
I THOUGHT JUNE WAS TOO SOON.
THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY IN
THE ECONOMY.
THE WEAKNESS IN THIS REPORT, WE
ALWAYS SAY ONE MONTH IS NOT A
TREND, THE LABOR SECRETARY SAID
AS MUCH.
THE REVISIONS OVER THE PRIOR TWO
OR THREE MONTHS START TO
ESTABLISH A TREND.
WE SEE A PRONOUNCED DECELERATION
IN THE LABOR MARKET THAT
REFLECTS THE DECELERATION WE SAW
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF
QUARTERS.
THIS IS NOT A VERIZON STRIKE
FLUTE.
THAT IS NOT THE ENTIRE STORY.
THIS IS THE LABOR MARKET
DOWNSHIFTING IN RESPONSE TO A
ECONOMY THAT IS DOWNSHIFTING.
SOME ECONOMISTS WILL TELL YOU
WE ARE AT A FULL MATURE ECONOMY.
THAT IS NOT WHAT WE ARE SEEING.
IF WE WERE A MATURE A COMMIE,
THAT WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN
UPSHIFT IN WAGE PRESSURES.
THAT IS NOT WHAT WE ARE SEEING
HERE.
WE ARE SEEING STEADY WAGE
PRESSURE AND DOWNSHIFTING IN
HIRING.
THAT RAISES REAL QUESTIONS ABOUT
THE UNDERLYING MOMENTUM IN THE
ECONOMY.
THIS MEANS JANET YELLEN ON
MONDAY MORNING AS A CHANCE TO
MAKE OR BREAK MIDYEAR RATE
MOVES.
FINAL POINT, THE MOST IMPORTANT
DATA POINT AHEAD OF THE JULY
MEETING IS JUNE PAYROLL.
JONATHAN: THIS WAS IN YOUR
REPORT FOR BLOOMBERG
INTELLIGENCE.
TALK US THROUGH.
WHY'S IT SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT?
CARL: THIS GOES TO THE POINT I
WAS MAKING ABOUT MATURING
BUSINESS CYCLES.
THE ORANGE LINE IS THE PACE OF
NONFARM PAYROLL.
THAT IS A 12 MONTH MOVING
AVERAGE.
THE WHITE LINE IS AVERAGE HOURLY
EARNINGS GROWTH.
WHAT WE CAN SEE IN THOSE CIRCLE
REGIONS IS AS LABOR COSTS
ACCELERATES, AS THE PRICE RISES
-- LIKE RISING EARNINGS GAIN,
BUSINESSES TRY TO MANAGE THE
COST.
EACH OF THOSE CYCLES, AS LABOR
COSTS RISES, THE PACE OF HIRING
MODERATED OR DOWNSHIFTED TO WE
CAN BRING THE CHART UP ONE LAST
TIME.
ON THE FAR RIGHT-HAND SIDE, YOU
CAN SEE WE ARE NOT SEEING A
PRONOUNCED ACCELERATION IN LABOR
COST JUST YET.
IT WILL HAPPEN AS WE MOVE
FURTHER BELOW 5% UNEMPLOYMENT.
IT IS NOT HAPPENING NOW.
RISING LABOR COSTS ARE NOT
EXPLAINING THE DOWNSHIFTED IN
HIRING.
MEGAN: I WILL GIVE YOU A
DIFFICULT TASK.
YOU ARE JANET YELLEN, WHAT DO
YOU SAY ABOUT THIS ON MONDAY?
CARL: I WOULD SAY, THIS IS A
DISTURBING TREND OR A TROUBLING
TREND.
JUNE IS TOO SOON.
WE NEED TO WAIT FOR CLARITY.
WE ARE CONFIDENT IN THE OUTLOOK.
THIS DOES PROVIDE A CHECK MARK
AGAINST THAT CONFIDENCE.
WE NEED TO WAIT FOR MORE
INFORMATION.
POTENTIALLY WE WILL HAVE THAT
INFORMATION IN TIME FOR JULY.
IF SHE ONLY HALFHEARTEDLY
DEFENDS A MIDYEAR HIKE IN JULY,
THEN TIME IS RUNNING OUT THIS
YEAR.
IF SHE HALFHEARTEDLY STILL JULY,
AND TO HIKES IN 2016 LEFT.
JONATHAN: THE PAYROLL REPORT
CAME OUT JUST OVER AN HOUR AGO.
THE HEADLINE NUMBER COMES IN AT
38,000.
WE WERE EXPECTING 160,000.
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS ESTIMATED
AT 4.9%, WE CAME IN AT 4.7%.
AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS 2.5%.
WE ARE 20 MINUTES INTO THE
SESSION.
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, MUCH
LOWER IN MAINLAND EUROPE WITH
THE DAX DOWN BY 1%.
A MUCH STRONGER EURO.
EURO-DOLLAR AT 11315.
YIELDS LOWER.
MY QUESTION TO YOU WOULD BE,
ABOUT A MONTH AGO EVERYONE WAS
SAYING THE FED WILL DO NOTHING
THIS SUMMER.
THEN EVERYONE SAID THE FED WILL
DO EVERYTHING THIS SUMMER.
ONE DATA POINT, THEY WILL DO
NOTHING THIS SUMMER.
TALK ME THROUGH THIS
OVERREACTION TO THE DOWNSIDE AND
THE UPSIDE.
JEFF: THERE IS CERTAINLY A LOT
OF SHORT-TERMISM.
MARKETS ARE AFFECTED BY THE
MOMENT.
TODAY'S MOVE IS WHAT YOU ARE
SEEING.
IN TERMS OF SHIFTING BACK AND
FORTH, THE FED DID NOT WANT TO
HAVE ZERO PROBABILITY OF A HIKE.
THAT IS WHAT THE MARKET HAS
PRICED IN.
THE DEBATE WAS ALWAYS JUNE,
JULY, TODAY AND THIS MORNING IS
ABOUT PUSHING OFF JUNE.
THE JUNE PAYROLL REPORT WE GET
NEXT MONTH, IT WILL TAKE ON
HEIGHTENED IMPORTANCE BECAUSE
TWO POINTS DETERMINE A LINE.
RIGHT NOW WE CAN SAY THIS IS A
ONE-OFF, IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE
LONGER-TERM TRAJECTORY.
THE NEXT REPORT MIGHT HAVE THAT
EFFECT.
THAT WILL TAKE ON GREATER
IMPORTANCE.
DAVID: THANK YOU.
CARL RICCADONNA, HE IS OUR CHIEF
U.S. ECONOMIST.
COMING BACK ON BLOOMBERG GO.
IT HAS BEEN A WILD DAY HERE.
♪
DAVID: THIS IS BLOOMBERG GO.
WE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A BIG
DAY BECAUSE OF THE PAYROLL.
WE DID NOT KNOW IT WOULD BE THIS
BIG OF A DAY.
THE SHOCKING NUMBER, 38,000.
WE TALKED EARLIER WITH BILL
GROSS.
TAKE A LISTEN.
BILL: I THINK IT IS ENOUGH OF A
SHOCK TO DELAY JUNE AND JULY FOR
SURE.
THE FED HAS TRIED TO CONVINCE US
THAT ONE OR TWO HEIGHTS THIS
YEAR IS IN THE CARDS I THINK
THEY WANT TO NORMALIZE THE YIELD
CURVE AND SHORT-TERM RATES.
A NUMBER LIKE THIS CANCELS OUT
IN MY THINKING JUNE IN
COMBINATION WITH BREXIT.
WE WILL LOOK FOR JULY.
JONATHAN: THAT WAS BILL GROSS
SPEAKING TO BLOOMBERG MOMENTS
AGO.
WHAT A DAY WE HAVE HAD.
LOOK AT THE REACTION.
FED FUND FUTURES, I CAN BRING IT
UP ON THE BLOOMBERG.
WE HAVE DROPPED LOW 5% FOR THE
MONTHS OF JUNE.
THIS IS REMARKABLE.
GOING INTO THE PAYROLL REPORT,
WE WERE AT THE 30S.
THIS MARKET HAS SWUNG SO MUCH IN
THE LAST MONTH.
FROM NO RATE HIKE TO WRITE TIGHT
AND BACK AGAIN.
DAVID: THE MARKET HAS BEEN SO
DESPERATE FOR SOME SIGN.
I'M NOT SURE THIS SIGN.
MEGAN: FOR ME IT IS 50,000 JOBS
LAST THAN EVEN THE MOST
PESSIMISTIC FORECAST.
WE CAN CALL IT ONE DATA POINT
ALL WE WANT.
IT IS A DATA POINT THAT MATTERS
TODAY AND WILL MANNER TO JANET
YELLEN ON MONDAY.
JONATHAN: WE WILL TALK ABOUT
WHETHER IT IS AN OUTLIER FOR THE
NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS.
DAVID: ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I
HAVE IS WHY IT IS AN OUTLIER.
WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE THAT IT
WILL BE AN ABERRATION?
WE WILL FIND OUT.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SPECIAL
INTERVIEWS NEXT WEEK.
I WILL HAVE AN IN-DEPTH LOOK AT
GENERAL MOTORS.
WE WILL HAVE THAT ON TUESDAY
YOU'RE ON BLOOMBERG GO.
JONATHAN: THAT IS IT.
WHAT A DAY.
WE HAVE HAD A BIG DOWNSIDE
SURPRISE ON THE PAYROLL NUMBERS.
FEWEST U.S. JOBS ADDED IN ALMOST
SIX YEARS.
FOR MYSELF AND DAVID WESTIN AND
MEGAN MURPHY, THANK YOU VERY
