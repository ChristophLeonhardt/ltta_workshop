after over two decades in the heart of America's spotlight Hillary Clinton is still sort of an unknown quantity for most Americans that's thanks to one factor and one factor only the love and worshipful attention of the mainstream media over the weekend no less than six terrible stories broke that would have crippled anyone else's campaign first we learned Clinton aide and confidant and super-special absolutely platonic friend Huma Abedin acted as assistant editor on the radical journal of Muslim minority affairs where she greenlit pieces that stated that quote pushing mothers out into the open labor market is a clear demonstration of a lack of respect of womanhood and motherhood among other things next we found out that Clinton blames former Secretary of State Colin Powell for giving her the idea to set up a private email server at a dinner party and the pal not only denied giving her the idea but also tonight ever having had a dinner conversation on the topic former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice who Clinton also claimed was there for the conversation she said she wasn't there either then we found out the Clinton State Department oversaw about six billion dollars in mismanagement fraud and incompetence then also it was revealed that Clinton's pay-for-play Clinton Foundation's donations in exchange for access to the State Department ran deeper than originally thought also we learned the FBI and Justice Department are investigating the Podesta group co-founded by Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta over its own ties with former Ukrainian presidents and Vladimir Putin Ally of Viktor Yanukovych finally we found out the FBI uncovered about fifteen thousand emails Clinton said never existed and that she failed to disclose to the State Department presumably these all do not concern yoga and Chelsea Clinton's wedding plans so what was the media's response to this tidal wave of incompetence in corruption well they focused on Trump naturally that's what they always do and that's why Trump became the Republican nominee in the first place in the media once painted former governor Mitt Romney the way they paint Trump they excoriated anyone who dared to ask about President Obama's botched Benghazi policy they scoffed at Romney's suggestion that Obama's Russian policy had embolden Moscow they yelled at legislators like Michelle Bachman for connecting Huma Abedin to Islamic radicalism via that same journal of Muslim minority affairs by the time Trump came along the American people had already rejected the media's capacity for truth-telling so in the media target and Trump and Trump didn't back down many Republicans resonated to Trump's call they believed that Trump would hit Clinton with all the material the media had covered up nord so far of course that hasn't really pans you out from has been pretty distractible but that doesn't mean he couldn't if from porter target clinton he'd be doing the job americans thought that they nominated him to do exposing the empress who's protected by the media praetorian guard if he doesn't clinton will become president scandals and all the media are still the gatekeepers they still have no intention of allowing hillary clinton to become the story when Trump's tweets it can be i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show alrighty so here we are lots to get to today here on the bench appear i want to start with something a little bit different so instead of talking presidential politics we'll get to that in just a little while the Trump flip on immigration and Coulter right now maybe we have to take away her belts in her shoelaces because she may never be on be on the verge of suicide will play audio then later explaining that she's maybe she she's about five minutes from driving down to the mobile local mobile station and dousing herself in gasoline and lighting a match we'll talk about why that is but we're gonna start today with trends gender identity so the federal government has decided it is absolutely vital and important that everybody in America believe that men can become women and women can become men and it's so vital that they're going to force children to engage in this fantasy and if you as a parent say no if you as a parent say no then presumably they will come in and take your kids that's really where this is going so the reason this comes up today is because there's this school district in Maryland and they've released a video that sort of an informative video directed toward administrators and teachers and and here is the video and and them basically pushing the transgender agenda this this do does it no matter what side of this issue one personally falls on however what is clear is this at Anne Arundel County Public Schools our charge is to fully support every student in their pursuit of reaching their full potential we owe students who identify as transgender the same levels of support as we do gay students poor students rich students special education students DLL students or any other group of students simply put in a school system that aims to elevate all students and eliminate all gaps all must mean all no exceptions what you are about to view is a training session conducted in June that covers the latest guidance and legal opinions regarding this matter clearly this is an evolving issue and the guidance from the courts or elsewhere may change in the coming months or years we will do everything we can to convey any such changes to you in a timely manner so that you can best support our students meanwhile please listen carefully to what you are about to hear a formal set of guidelines will be provided to principals and department heads to distribute as needed if you have general questions please contact the office of student services specific legal questions on a particular case please contact the office of legal services okay he goes on in this video to explain that what ought to happen in cases where boys think they are girls and therefore want to go on overnight sleeping trips with girls what should the school do so according this is serious really according to this school district according that guy Chris Christie over there according to that dude the idea here is that we now must not tell parents that it's even happening we can't tell parents that this is even happening really here's the the quote from the video he says so many of you might be asking yourself so I'm at an overnight field trip and I have a student whose biological email identifies his female and we've worked with that student and her family and that student wants to sleep in the dorms or whatever sleeping arrangements are with the females they don't want to sleep in a room by themselves they want to sleep with the rest of the females so what do we do and the answer is they sleep with the females that's not the easy answer it's the right answer and in some cases it's gonna cause issues because the private information piece doesn't allow you to share that with parents of all the other campers right so that's difficult okay so let's just be straight about this this is not just him saying they're going to notify the parents that this is their new policy what he's saying is we won't even tell parents it's happening we won't even tell parents happening so you have a 12 year old girl and she goes on a sleepaway trip for a night to the local aquarium and there's a 12 year old boy who thinks he's a girl and it's okay not only is it okay by the school district if he sleeps next to the girls because obviously he's a girl cuz he says he is not only is that okay they're not even going to inform the parents about it because none of the parents business if there's a boy sleeping next to the girls take it a step up they're 15 years old now okay they're they're now they've now hit puberty and you've got a boy who says he's a girl and he wants to sleep in the same tent as the girls you're not even gonna tell the parents about this you're not even so there are two issues here one is well really three one is the basic biology of the situation boys can't become girls girls can't become boys the notion that transgenderism is a is a an objectively real status as far as relabeling someone from male to female is just it's just foolish I mean there's no biological basis to the idea that a man who thinks he's a woman is actually a woman there's no biological basis to that there isn't there's biological basis to the idea this person is suffering from a significant and dangerous mental illness I think probably most along the lines of anorexia you know somebody who just has body dysmorphia basically but that's not the same thing as saying that this is now a girl so the school is number one saying no this is a girl that's number one number two they're saying it's nasty and terrible mask and awful if the other girls feel uncomfortable now I'm old enough to remember a time when it was considered bad form bad form for a boy to launder into the girls locker room why not cuz he was gonna rape them but because it makes girls feel uncomfortable to be unclad in front of boys and it was considered an assault on women and assaults on feminism to suggest that men should be able to walk into women's locker rooms a title mine was specifically designed with this in mind title 9 of the Civil Rights Act was designed with this in mind the idea that there is men and there's women and women should be treated equally with men with equal dignity and their privacy should be protected the federal government is so insane that now they're trying to reinterpret this as gender that you identify as which of course means nothing because it Y have separate locker rooms at all if the idea is that the girls are so terrible because there's a guy who identifies a girl coming into their locker room if they're so terrible then what's the problem the guy identifies is a guy are you telling me that these people are safer with it with with a guy who identifies as a girl than as a guy who identifies as a guy like where's the scientific evidence to back that wound up that the normal guy is more likely to be a sexual abuser or rapist than the transgender guy is there any evidence to support that notion I mean I'm waiting for the evidence to support that notion I'm not making the claim transgender people are outstandingly dangerous I'm making the claim that other people are not but the claim seems to be your less dangerous to women if you're transgender then you would be if you weren't transgender and I just don't see any evidence to back that up I'd like to see the rates on that so that's the second issue is this is this crazy notion by the federal government that boys and girls are exactly the same and then we get to the real issue and the real issues the federal government has decided that certain subjective realities can now be imposed on everyone through force of governments now the government says that if you believe that there's a god and therefore you believe that and you believe that that God gave us a Bible and therefore you believe that it's sinful for you to take part in the same-sex wedding the government says your subjective reality must be overruled by our version of reality in which the Bible is nonsense that you have to serve the gay couple right that's what the that's what the federal government essentially says they say that your subjective reality as a religious person is irrelevant to our concerns but when it comes to a transgender person saying they're a girl then all of a sudden we have to we have to abide by their subjective reality we can't use any objective measures of reality what's worse if you as a parents object to this they will take away your kids that's the next step this is where this is going and it's this is really dangerous stuff this is where it's going it's a very short step from your kid is in a bedroom with a transgender girl and we're not telling you about it too your kid is having transgender feelings is having gender dysphoria is confused about gender not even transgender feelings just as confused about his or her gender you think that that's that's evidence that the kid needs some psychological help we think that means the kid should transition we're coming into the home and we're seizing the kid we're coming into that for the protection of the child the child cannot be victimized by you and your Bonita dye Diaz about biological sex we have to take the kid away from you that's where this is going and the left will deny that that's where this is going of course but it's obvious this is that's where this is going every time by the way the left denies that that they're they're hardcore views lead to something bad within five years it's already led to that thing but you can see the clear chain here so they're already doing this with regard to homosexuality so if you're a religious parents and you have a kid who might be worried that he's gay might be ordered these experiencing same-sex attraction the left has already declared based on absolute pseudoscience that sexual orientation is immutable and unchanging there no evidence none that sexual orientation is immutable and unchanging there's pie it could be biological partly there's it certainly it's not wholly biological they say it could be partly biological be environmental it could be social there are a lot of factors that go into shaping sexual orientation which is why you'll see people like Anne Heche you know Mary Ellen's generous and then she and then she leaves Ellen DeGeneres and marries a dude right you see this all the time you see you see guys who were straight for their entire life's and suddenly they're gay it could work the other way too except the left doesn't wish to acknowledge that there is variability and mutability to sexual orientation so they create this fiction where about your biological sex is irrelevant your gender identity is inborn you're a boy boy born in a girl's body which is nonsense and your sexual orientation is inborn you're born gay you're born straight you're putting this you're born now okay you're born with certain inclinations but those inclinations are impacted by environment and society and treatment and all the rest of it just like every other human behavior sex is no exception so the fact that what they're what they did so here's the deal what they did with with the religious parent who has a kid who's worried that he might have sexual attraction to somebody the same sex religious parents used to say okay let's go to the psychiatrist and let's let's talk about whether this is real how severe it is whether this is just normal kind of gender and sexual confusion that happens with a lot of kids okay really this happens with a lot of kids there are a lot of kids if you've ever had a teenage brother or sister if you've ever been a teenager yourself the chances are very high that you were sexually confused at one point or another you can see it in Britain right him in Britain there are new polls out that show that only about 40% of British young people consider themselves completely straight right that's as opposed to people above the age of 16 ninety percent of them consider themselves completely straight that's because how people view their own sexual orientation changes over time their attractions may change over time the left has decided it's entirely biological the next step has been okay if you have a kid you're a religious person you and your kid has sexual attraction to another kid of the same sex and you say okay well let's let's treat doubt let's talk about whether that's a good thing let's let's see if you're if you're actually gay or if you're straight if there's a way to to alter your sexual behavior and your sexual attraction that's now illegal in the state of California it's illegal in the state of California so if you have a gay kid and the gay kid wants to become straight that's legal in the state of California if you have a stray kid and in or if you have a gay kid and the gay kid wants to become straight that's that's illegal in the state of California for you to take that kid to a psychiatrist or to a psychologist because that's that's harmful to the child you can see that's gonna be the next step here the next step is gonna be you have a kid your kids three years old your kid decides one day they want to dress up as a boys a girl and they decide they wanna dress up as a boy and you say honey cut it out and then the kid goes to school and tells the teacher you know I was at home and I wanted to dress up as a boy and mommy told me I couldn't and next thing you know the teachers calling Child Protective Services saying that you're damaging the psyche of the child because obviously if the kid the three-year-old says that she is a he then then she must be right she is absolutely a he can see where this is going because the left has to impose its own version of reality on everybody else and the reason the left has to impose its own version of reality on everybody else is because the Utopia of the left with the left truly seeks is a fully androgynous society in which male and female have nothing there there's no separation there they're trying to create an excuse for bigger government in essence because the truth is we all have various differences male-female tall short strong weak we all various differences that were born with and those differences contribute to our outcomes in life the left doesn't like that so what the left wants to do is just pretend that there are no differences that in the end all differences can be wiped away if we just change society around us so men can become women women can become men gay people can't become Straight But straight society should just assume that all kids who have any sort of sexual attraction at any point to another kid of the same sex those people are mutable egay but all of this is designed to lead to familial confusion larger government control and an attempt to break down the family structure so that when we are all genderless androgynous widgets who are fully mutable in terms of our sex then the government can step in and make everybody equal so the government is gonna make sure the government uses the excuse of bullying in order to cram down its own version of reality and the cram down their own version of reality in order to assert their power over you and your ability to parent and your ability to take care of your own kid we'll talk a little bit more about that in just a little while but you have to go to Daley wire for the rest of that
