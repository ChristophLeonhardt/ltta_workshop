THE COUNTRY WHERE WOMEN COULD NOT INHERIT PROPERTY LAWFULLY.

121
00:03:24,473 --> 00:03:25,807

00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,981
RIGHT TO KEEP THEIR OWN WAGES, IF THEY HAD A HUSBAND, EVEN

126
00:03:32,982 --> 00:03:34,483
IF THEY HAD A HUSBAND, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE EARNING THEM.

127
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:36,118
THOUGH THEY WERE EARNING THEM. THEY WERE REALLY FUNDAMENTAL

128
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:36,452
THEY WERE REALLY FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.

129
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:37,219
RIGHTS. THEY WERE ALSO OFTEN WOMEN WHO

00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:40,089
THEY WERE ALSO OFTEN WOMEN WHO WERE COMING OUT OF THE ABOLITION

131
00:03:40,123 --> 00:03:40,722
WERE COMING OUT OF THE ABOLITION MOVEMENT, SO THEY WERE

132
00:03:40,757 --> 00:03:42,357
MOVEMENT, SO THEY WERE CONTINUING A STRUGGLE FOR THE

00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:44,126
CONTINUING A STRUGGLE FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL RECOGNITION THAT

134
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,061
CONSTITUTIONAL RECOGNITION THAT ALL PEOPLE DESERVE A PLACE IN

135
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:47,629
ALL PEOPLE DESERVE A PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY.

136
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:52,567
THIS COUNTRY. IT REQUIRED THE INCREDIBLE

137
00:03:52,602 --> 00:03:53,735
IT REQUIRED THE INCREDIBLE SELF-SACRIFICE OF LIKE

00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:54,136
SELF-SACRIFICE OF LIKE IMPRISONMENT.

139
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,471
IMPRISONMENT. PEOPLE HAD EGGS THROWN AT THEM.

140
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:56,538
PEOPLE HAD EGGS THROWN AT THEM. PEOPLE HAD OBJECTS THROWN AT

PEACEFULLY DOWN THE STREET WHEN THEY WERE SUFFRAGETTES.

144
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:02,277
THEY WERE SUFFRAGETTES. IF IT WEREN’T FOR THAT AND IF IT

00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:03,712
IF IT WEREN’T FOR THAT AND IF IT WEREN’T THEIR STRATEGY BOTH AT

00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,328
MUCH LIKE THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOMENT, BY SHOWING THE

155
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:21,964
MOMENT, BY SHOWING THE INHUMANITY OF THE CRACKDOWN ON

PEACEFUL PROTEST THAT SORT OF TURNED THE TIDES.

00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:26,969
TURNED THE TIDES. BUT IT REQUIRED THE PROTESTS.

160
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:28,771
BUT IT REQUIRED THE PROTESTS. >> SO AS SOMEBODY WHO STUDIES

GET WOMEN TO VOTE, WHY DO YOU THINK SOME PEOPLE STILL DON’T IN

165
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:36,612
THINK SOME PEOPLE STILL DON’T IN THIS COUNTRY?

166
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:37,880
THIS COUNTRY? IS IT JUST THAT WE DON’T KNOW

167
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:40,149
IS IT JUST THAT WE DON’T KNOW THE HISTORY?

168
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,184
THE HISTORY? WE DON’T THINK IT AFFECTS US ALL

169
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:43,352
WE DON’T THINK IT AFFECTS US ALL THAT MUCH?

170
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:45,287
THAT MUCH? >> FUNDAMENTALLY, WE AS A

171
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:46,288
>> FUNDAMENTALLY, WE AS A COUNTRY MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT

172
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:49,057
COUNTRY MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE, PARTICULARLY

173
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:51,093
FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE, PARTICULARLY SINGLE WOMEN, WOMEN OF COLOR.

174
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:53,395
SINGLE WOMEN, WOMEN OF COLOR. THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR

175
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:53,696
THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR THAT.

176
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:54,530
THAT. EVERYTHING FROM ACTIVE VOTER

177
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:55,464
EVERYTHING FROM ACTIVE VOTER SUPPRESSION, WHICH I KNOW YOU

178
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:57,700
SUPPRESSION, WHICH I KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT ON YOUR SHOW, ALI.

179
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:59,268
TALK ABOUT ON YOUR SHOW, ALI. BUT ALSO, THE FACT THAT WE

180
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:00,903
BUT ALSO, THE FACT THAT WE LITERALLY MAKE IT HARD.

181
00:05:00,904 --> 00:05:02,305
LITERALLY MAKE IT HARD. SO EARLY VOTING AND BEING ABLE

182
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:04,340
SO EARLY VOTING AND BEING ABLE TO VOTE EARLY, BEING ABLE TO

183
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:06,108
TO VOTE EARLY, BEING ABLE TO VOTE BY MAIL INCREASES THE

184
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:07,009
VOTE BY MAIL INCREASES THE OPPORTUNITY, PARTICULARLY FOR

185
00:05:07,043 --> 00:05:08,277
OPPORTUNITY, PARTICULARLY FOR SINGLE WOMEN TO VOTE.

186
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,812
SINGLE WOMEN TO VOTE. THIS IS BECAUSE SINGLE WOMEN ARE

187
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:11,714
THIS IS BECAUSE SINGLE WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO WORK MULTIPLE

188
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:12,014
MORE LIKELY TO WORK MULTIPLE JOBS.

189
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:13,549
JOBS. THEY’RE MORE LIKELY TO BE PAID

190
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:14,817
THEY’RE MORE LIKELY TO BE PAID AN HOURLY WAGE.

191
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:19,588
AN HOURLY WAGE. WE DON’T HAVE A DAY OFF FOR

192
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:21,190
WE DON’T HAVE A DAY OFF FOR VOTING THE WAY SOME COUNTRIES

193
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:21,924
VOTING THE WAY SOME COUNTRIES DO, WHICH MEANS YOU’RE CHOOSING

194
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:22,658
DO, WHICH MEANS YOU’RE CHOOSING BETWEEN BUYING YOUR GROCERIES

195
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:23,893
BETWEEN BUYING YOUR GROCERIES AND PAYING YOUR RENT AND VOTING.

196
00:05:23,894 --> 00:05:25,128
AND PAYING YOUR RENT AND VOTING. IF YOU GIVE PEOPLE THAT KIND OF

197
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:26,529
IF YOU GIVE PEOPLE THAT KIND OF VOICE, EVEN IF THEY WANT TO

198
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,797
VOICE, EVEN IF THEY WANT TO VOTE, THEY HAVE TO PAY THE RENT.

199
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:29,432
VOTE, THEY HAVE TO PAY THE RENT. THEY HAVE TO FEED THEIR KIDS.

200
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:31,200
THEY HAVE TO FEED THEIR KIDS. >> IN EVERY PRESIDENTIAL

201
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:32,702
>> IN EVERY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SINCE 1980, THE

202
00:05:32,703 --> 00:05:33,836
ELECTION SINCE 1980, THE PROPORTION OF ELIGIBLE WOMEN WHO

203
00:05:33,871 --> 00:05:37,506
PROPORTION OF ELIGIBLE WOMEN WHO VOTE HAS EXCEEDED MEN.

204
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,941
VOTE HAS EXCEEDED MEN. WE’VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

205
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:41,144
WE’VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WOMEN MOBILIZE AS A FORCE TO

206
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:41,444
WOMEN MOBILIZE AS A FORCE TO VOTE.

207
00:05:41,445 --> 00:05:42,312
VOTE. WE HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN WOMEN

208
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:43,746
WE HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN WOMEN MOBILIZE POLITICALLY IN A WAY WE

209
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:45,314
MOBILIZE POLITICALLY IN A WAY WE HAVEN’T EVEN SEEN BEFORE, MAYBE

210
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:48,551
HAVEN’T EVEN SEEN BEFORE, MAYBE SINCE 1917.

211
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:50,920
SINCE 1917. SINCE 2016, WE SAW WOMEN

212
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:52,555
SINCE 2016, WE SAW WOMEN MOBILIZE IN ALABAMA IN THE

213
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:53,589
MOBILIZE IN ALABAMA IN THE SENATORIAL ELECTION, AND WE’RE

214
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:54,657
SENATORIAL ELECTION, AND WE’RE SEEING A RECORD NUMBER OF WOMEN

215
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:55,925
SEEING A RECORD NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO ARE RUNNING IN THIS

216
00:05:55,926 --> 00:05:56,259
WHO ARE RUNNING IN THIS ELECTION.

217
00:05:56,293 --> 00:05:57,560
ELECTION. >> YES, AND I THINK THAT’S A

218
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:00,396
>> YES, AND I THINK THAT’S A GREAT SIGN FOR DEMOCRACY.

219
00:06:00,431 --> 00:06:01,931
GREAT SIGN FOR DEMOCRACY. OUR DEMOCRACY WORKS IF IT

220
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:06,469
OUR DEMOCRACY WORKS IF IT REPRESENTS ALL OF US.

221
00:06:06,503 --> 00:06:07,170
REPRESENTS ALL OF US. ALL OF US IS A VERY DIVERSE

222
00:06:07,171 --> 00:06:07,937
ALL OF US IS A VERY DIVERSE GROUP OF PEOPLE.

223
00:06:07,972 --> 00:06:09,672
GROUP OF PEOPLE. WOMEN ALSO MIRROR THAT DIVERSITY

224
00:06:09,707 --> 00:06:14,076
WOMEN ALSO MIRROR THAT DIVERSITY BUT ALSO ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO

225
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:17,647
BUT ALSO ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO LEAD IN A SLAB TIFFCOLLABORATIVE

226
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:18,882
LEAD IN A SLAB TIFFCOLLABORATIVE THEY’RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO LOOK

227
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:21,351
THEY’RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO LOOK FOR BIPARTISANSHIP, TO FOCUS ON

228
00:06:21,352 --> 00:06:22,686
FOR BIPARTISANSHIP, TO FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS THAT WILL ACTIVELY

229
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,554
SOLUTIONS THAT WILL ACTIVELY IMPACT PEOPLE’S LIVES.

230
00:06:23,588 --> 00:06:24,988
IMPACT PEOPLE’S LIVES. SO WE NEED THAT KIND OF

231
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,822
SO WE NEED THAT KIND OF LEADERSHIP, WHETHER IT’S IN THE

232
00:06:25,856 --> 00:06:26,856
LEADERSHIP, WHETHER IT’S IN THE STATE HOUSE OR IN CONGRESS.

233
00:06:26,857 --> 00:06:27,657
STATE HOUSE OR IN CONGRESS. I THINK THAT MOBILIZATION IS

234
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:29,693
I THINK THAT MOBILIZATION IS VERY MUCH A RESPONSE TO DONALD

235
00:06:29,727 --> 00:06:31,228
VERY MUCH A RESPONSE TO DONALD TRUMP MAKING VERY CLEAR THAT HE

236
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:33,163
TRUMP MAKING VERY CLEAR THAT HE WANTS TO SEND WOMEN’S RIGHTS IN

237
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:34,598
WANTS TO SEND WOMEN’S RIGHTS IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

238
00:06:34,599 --> 00:00:00,000
THE WRONG DIRECTION. >> MAYA, THANK YOU FOR THE WORK
