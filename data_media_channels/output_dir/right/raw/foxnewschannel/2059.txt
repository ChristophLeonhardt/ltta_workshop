>> GOOD MORNING.

31
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,414
STEVE: THE EXPERTS GOT THE

32
00:00:54,414 --> 00:00:55,748
WHOLE ELECTION WRONG IN 2016

33
00:00:55,748 --> 00:00:57,517
AND THEY CONTINUE TO GET IT

34
00:00:57,517 --> 00:00:58,585
WRONG REGARDING WHO VOTED

35
00:00:58,585 --> 00:00:59,052
FOR HIM.

36
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:00,720
>> THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

37
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,555
THERE IS THIS MOVEMENT GOING

38
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:02,822
ON.

39
00:01:02,822 --> 00:01:03,790
AND WE'RE STILL NOT

40
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,090
LISTENING TO WHAT IT IS

41
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,693
SAYING TO US.

42
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:07,827
AND THAT'S SORT OF THE

43
00:01:07,827 --> 00:01:09,629
IMPORTANT PART OF THIS BOOK.

44
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:11,764
IS THAT IT TAKES READERS NOT

45
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:13,366
ONLY REMINDS THEM WHO THESE

46
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:15,034
VOTERS ARE AND THE DIFFERENT

47
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,769
ARCHITECTS THAT MAKE UP THE

48
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:17,136
COALITION.

49
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:18,705
BUT HOW THEY ARE IMPACTING

50
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:20,373
THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD

51
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:22,075
BEYOND THE BALLOT BOX.

52
00:01:22,075 --> 00:01:22,508
STEVE: SURE.

53
00:01:22,508 --> 00:01:23,343
BRAD, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

54
00:01:23,343 --> 00:01:26,312
PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR DONALD

55
00:01:26,312 --> 00:01:27,447
TRUMP, NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP,

56
00:01:27,447 --> 00:01:28,815
WHAT THE EXPERTS GOT WRONG

57
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:30,049
IS THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

58
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:31,684
WHY THE PEOPLE IN THE RUST

59
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:34,387
BELT COUNTIES, WHO VOTED FOR

60
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:35,455
BARACK OBAMA, WHY THEY WOULD

61
00:01:35,455 --> 00:01:36,856
EVER VOTE FOR THE REPUBLICAN

62
00:01:36,856 --> 00:01:37,290
DONALD TRUMP.

63
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,324
BUT THEY DID.

64
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:39,392
>> NO QUESTION.

65
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:41,027
YOU KNOW, WHEN BILL CLINTON

66
00:01:41,027 --> 00:01:42,662
WON RE-ELECTION IN THE

67
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:45,398
1990s, HE WON 1500

68
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:45,832
COUNTIES.

69
00:01:45,832 --> 00:01:46,866
WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WON THE

70
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:48,268
POPULAR VOTE SHE DID SO

71
00:01:48,268 --> 00:01:49,769
WINNING LESS THAN 500

72
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:50,136
COUNTIES.

73
00:01:50,136 --> 00:01:51,170
A LOT OF THESE PLACES IF YOU

74
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,205
LOOK AT OHIO AND WISCONSIN

75
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:53,273
AND PENNSYLVANIA ARE PLACES

76
00:01:53,273 --> 00:01:55,141
WHERE DOZENS OF COUNTIES

77
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:57,777
FLIPPED FROM OBAMA IN 2012

78
00:01:57,777 --> 00:01:59,812
TO DONALD TRUMP IN 2016.

79
00:01:59,812 --> 00:02:01,080
STEVE: ALL RIGHT, IN YOUR

80
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,881
BOOK, HAVE YOU GOT DIFFERENT

81
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:03,950
NAMES FOR SOME OF THE

82
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,951
DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS.

83
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:06,619
FOR INSTANCE, ROUGH

84
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:09,222
REBOUNDERS, KING CYRUS

85
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:09,656
EVANGELICALS.

86
00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:10,423
REPORTER RELIABLES.

87
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:11,658
LET'S START AT THE TOP.

88
00:02:11,658 --> 00:02:12,992
ROUGH REBOUNDERS WHO ARE

89
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:13,293
THEY?

90
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:15,261
>> THOSE ARE THE VOTERS WHO

91
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:17,430
HAVE HAD A SET BACK IN LIFE,

92
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,564
EITHER WHETHER IT'S A

93
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:20,099
TRAGEDY IN THE FAMILY, AN

94
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,768
ECONOMIC SET BACK THAT LOST

95
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:22,936
THEIR JOB, AND THOSE WERE

96
00:02:22,936 --> 00:02:24,070
THE VOTERS THAT WENT TO

97
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,905
DONALD TRUMP PRETTY DARN

98
00:02:25,905 --> 00:02:26,372
QUICKLY.

99
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:28,841
BECAUSE THEY SAW IN HIM

100
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:30,677
SOMEONE WHO MADE A COME

101
00:02:30,677 --> 00:02:30,977
BACK.

102
00:02:30,977 --> 00:02:32,045
AND SOMEONE WHO WAS ABLE TO

103
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:35,515
LAND ON THEIR FEET AND THEY

104
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:37,050
JUST RALLIED AROUND HIM VERY

105
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,751
QUICKLY.

106
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:39,552
STEVE: KING CYRUS

107
00:02:39,552 --> 00:02:39,986
EVANGELICALS?

108
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:40,987
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE

109
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:42,021
NOTED THAT EVANGELICAL

110
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:42,588
SUPPORTED TRUMP.

111
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:44,290
BUT THAT STARTED EVEN IN THE

112
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:44,657
PRIMARIES.

113
00:02:44,657 --> 00:02:46,225
IT REALLY WAS A VERY

114
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:46,826
PRAGMATIC VOTE.

115
00:02:46,826 --> 00:02:49,529
THEY DIDN'T FIND A LOT IN

116
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:50,897
SORT OF PERSONAL BACKGROUND

117
00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:51,831
IN COMMON WITH DONALD TRUMP,

118
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:53,032
BUT THEY FOUND SHARED

119
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:56,569
PRIORITIES.

120
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:58,371
STEVE: REPORTER

121
00:02:58,371 --> 00:02:58,404

STEVE: ROTARYER

124
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:00,206
STEVE: ROTARY RELIABLES.

125
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:01,307
>> REGULAR REPUBLICANS WHO

126
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:03,509
LIVED IN SUBURBAN COUNTIES

127
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:07,313
THAT IF THEY LIVED IN

128
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:09,482
COUNTIES THAT WHERE EVERYONE

129
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:10,283
WAS LIKE THEM.

130
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:11,684
THEY HAD THE SAME COLLEGE

131
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:12,051
EDUCATION.

132
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:13,853
THEY DIDN'T VOTE FOR TRUMP

133
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:14,887
BUT IF THEY LIVED IN

134
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:17,357
COUNTIES WHERE THERE WAS A

135
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:18,491
MIXED ECONOMIC SITUATION,

136
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:20,059
THEY WENT FOR TRUMP AND THEY

137
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:21,928
WENT FOR TRUMP STRONG ALONG

138
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:24,230
WITH THE UNCOLLEGED EDUCATED

139
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:24,630
VOTERS.

140
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,331
STEVE: THAT'S A LOOK BACK.

141
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,499
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW IF

142
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:27,867
YOU WATCH ALL THE OTHER

143
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:28,801
CHANNELS, YOU KNOW THEY ARE

144
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:31,871
PROBABLY RIGHT NOW DOING A

145
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:33,172
BULLETIN ON STORMY DANIELS.

146
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,674
HOW MUCH DOES STORMY DANIELS

147
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:38,544
AND THAT SAGA PLAY INTO THE

148
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:39,645
LOYALTY THAT THESE PEOPLE

149
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:40,313
INVESTED IN DONALD TRUMP?

150
00:03:40,313 --> 00:03:42,215
>> WELL, WE DIDN'T HEAR

151
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:43,716
STORIES ABOUT SCANDAL ON THE

152
00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:45,018
ROAD AND TALKING TO TRUMP

153
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:47,453
VOTERS IN THE RUST BELT.

154
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:48,021
STEVE: DO THEY CARE?

155
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:49,389
>> THEY TEND TO THINK THIS

156
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:50,957
IS ABOUT THEM NOT ABOUT THE

157
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:52,492
SOAP OPERAS GOING ON IN

158
00:03:52,492 --> 00:03:53,226
WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK.

159
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:54,193
IF YOU DIDN'T SEE THIS

160
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,294
ELECTION COMING, WE HOPE

161
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:56,429
THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU.

162
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:57,764
IF YOU DIDN'T SEE WHAT'S

00:03:57,764 --> 00:03:58,931
HAPPENED WITH DICK'S

00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:00,266
SPORTING GOODS AND SOME OF

165
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:01,501
THE OTHER COMMERCIAL BRANDS

166
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:02,969
MADE BAD DECISIONS REGARDING

167
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:03,836
THIS COALITION IN THE LAST

168
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:05,104
YEAR, WE THINK THIS BOOK IS

169
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:06,039
FOR YOU, TOO.

170
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,007
YOU MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING.

171
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:08,674
STEVE: YOU WATCH THE OTHER

172
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:09,742
CHANNELS AND SEE PEOPLE ON

173
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:11,110
THIS CHANNEL AS WELL WHO SAY

174
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,211
LOOK, THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED

175
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,746
FOR DONALD TRUMP IN 2016,

176
00:04:13,746 --> 00:04:15,615
THEY GOT AN --FUL.

177
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:17,983
THEY HAVE HAD IT UP TO HERE

178
00:04:17,983 --> 00:04:18,584
WITH HIM.

179
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:20,685
THEY ARE GOING TO FLIP.

180
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:21,154
DO YOU BUY THAT.

181
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:23,523
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN WHOLESALE

182
00:04:23,523 --> 00:04:26,159
EVIDENCE OF THAT IF

183
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,894
ANYTHING, I HAVE SEEN

184
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:29,028
STRENGTHENING AND MORE OF A

185
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:32,999
COALESCING AROUND HIM.

186
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:33,866
DONALD TRUMP WAS THE RESULT

187
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:36,502
OF THIS ELECTION IT WASN'T

188
00:04:36,502 --> 00:04:37,003
THE CAUSE.

189
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:38,471
THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK THAT

190
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:39,439
ACTUALLY TAKES A LOOK AT THE

191
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,107
PEOPLE WHO PUT HIM INTO

192
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:42,075
OFFICE AND WHAT THEY'RE
