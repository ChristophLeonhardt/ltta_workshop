hey everybody it's Kurt Schlichter I am back again here on rebel media with another edition of take that with Kurt Schlichter check it out got the bowling shirt why do I have a bowling shirt on today why did I choose that particular fashion option well it's appropriate they like everything I do it's completely calculated its plan and precise and and exact why why a bowling shirt because I'm here to celebrate normal Americans to celebrate that a little later we're gonna have my friend and fellow Pennsylvania homie yeah Selena Zito she's got a book that's killing it called the great revolt the president tweeted about it I should be so lucky when my book the militant normals think of it as the great revolt with a lot more swears when that drops in October but Salinas is out now it's a huge and she's agreed to come talk to me because I have incriminating evidence so that'll happen but first let's talk about the week that's been so far oh my gosh this may be the greatest week ever let's start with the Iran deal oh wait there isn't one gone destroyed blown away but in a little mushroom cloud little puffs of smoke because Donald Trump has taken a startling new direction in American foreign policy one that's surprised and scandalized the elite he's actually kept his promise you see when he was running for election he promised to get rid of the Iran deal and now ladies president he's going to get rid of the Iran deal mind blown whoa we finally have a Republican who does what he promises instead of going to Washington and growing in office and all the usual suspects are outraged he got failed novelist what's-his-name Rhodes Ben Rhodes he got John Kerry that horse looking french weirdo who Hillary Clinton has put down the fog for a second to complain about it beautiful and Obama his legacy well his his legacy is a smoke and ruin with tumbleweeds and people weeping and mourning and lamentations of the women and such because there's nothing left his failed presidency is gone gone was the wind so that's been fun and what else is going on oh yeah Eric Schneiderman yeah yeah that career kind of took a interesting new direction there's lots of exploding metaphors going on with Democrats lately aren't there he really screwed up by being a freak and a pervert you see Eric Schneiderman was the Attorney General of New York he's supposed to be a law enforcement officer he's supposed to be honest and direct and uncorruptible and you know justice is blind well no justice is stupid at least in New York because he was terrible he was a liberal activist using the law to declare war on conservatives oh and women you see he didn't just like women he liked to get women and beat them up and when I say beat them up I don't mean just kind of be mean to him I mean like physically slap them around if you read the story in The New Yorker which Ronan Farrow dropped a few days ago you know you start out kind of laughing because he's a terrible person you like to see bad things having a terrible people and then you stop laughing about four or five lines into it because what he's done is so ugly and so gross that you're just shaking your head he would get women and just start hitting them and he dug it it's like 50 shades of blue state right why are all these guys such weirdos she got Teddy Kennedy he's got he's got confirmed kills he's the pro but you got Schneiderman he's trying bill clinton put some ice on that what is it with liberal men democrat heroes beaten up on women i think it's sick i think it's disgusting but what's even more disgusting is the women who were beating up they would go to their liberal friends and say hey you know this liberal hero is beating the hell out of me you know he'll get staggeringly drunk because this guy he'd do two bottles of wine right and then a fifth of brown liquor first of all mixing your liquors bad move but that's a lot of booze so this guy be you know if he was a rapper he'd be named MC hammered all the time you know with it and then you know completely sloshed and they start beating them and choking them and it's just you know you reading this just go with what was the thought process that led this guy to think this was okay anyway the women would go to their fellow liberal women and say you know it's it's beaten the hell out of me and the liberal woman say you can't say anything daddy's silent because he's much too important to the liberal cause you know for the truth to come out you know women you are collateral damage in the journey to the progressive utopia you know you know put you off the side of the road in a ditch you don't matter because you know down the road everything's gonna be perfect run by the kind of people who beat the hell out of women and then you know tell the women who are beaten up to be silent about it that's that's the plan that's the utopia for them so we've seen that so we got the Iran deal gone we got Schneiderman gone what else do we have elections Wow we had primary elections in states like Ohio when Indiana and in West Virginia well the guy in Ohio Jim Rohn AC seemed to do pretty well he'll run against sherrod Brown he has a decent chance of winning and the guy in India's guy named Mike Braun and he's kind of an outsider Trump guy and he has a good chance of beating Joe Donnelly because Joe Donnelly only got in because whatever the hell the name of the dumb Republican in there yeah here's an idea when you're running for something as a Republican and someone asks you your opinion of rape here's what you say I'm against it then you shut up all right I don't understand these guys well you know I have some theories about it let me let me get out the chalkboard you know women like that shut up okay it's easy rape is bad just go with that go with the rape is bad anyway the guy who decided to elaborate on his theories about rape or women's biology or whatever it was he was kind of like Todd akin junior numbskull this Joe Donnelly a Democrat beats and of course you know he's a moderate Democrats a blue state independent Democrat who goes in and does exactly what Schumer says so he may lose but if my broad may beat him and that's great but West Virginia West Virginia was amazing because there were you know there was a Patrick Morrissey and something something Jenkins and they were kind of like normal candidates and they were fighting and there was Don Blankenship Don who you know even though Tuesday night didn't quite go his way at least he got off of probation you know at least his parole parole technically cuz he got you know thrown in jail for conspiring conspiracy to ignore mining regulations which result in the deaths of twenty nine guys so let's just say it was kind of a wounded candidate but not satisfied with being convicted of conspiracy to ignore regulations to kill twenty nine people Don Blankenship who was rich and looked like the guy who just sold your life insurance decided to make what may be the greatest campaign commercial of all time so he gets out there and it looks like it you know check out my high production values right you know one tenth this good he's out there like in front of like it looks like a trailer and he's like this he's like I am here to fight Mitch McConnell he is getting lots of money from China people I love it the China people cuz get it Mitch McConnell's wife is of Chinese origin Elaine Chao he was getting money from China Chinese people or China people not Chinese China people it's like David Bowie little China girl he's not even there he's like China people and then he goes I will go to Washington I will fight train the swamp and fight cocaine Mitch what cocaine Mitch what well Mitch got all say hello to my little friend because he black and ship comes in last and the president was like I'm not doing Roy Moore to the revenge right we're not doing that so he tweets out over ain't blankenship because the guy's insane the cocaine Mitch baby the greatest nickname I've ever heard even Trump's gotta be going damn beats lyin Ted you know it beats Low Energy I'm not sure beats Low Energy right it's competitive but coke a bitch is the greatest yeah nickname I ever heard and you know McColl's like this look nobody nobody gets more frustrated with Mitch McConnell than me but you gotta hand it to this guy homie is a knife fighter he will get you and he got Blankenship he gets Trump to tweet against him he throws money and at the end you know Blankenship goes down in flames right he just comes in third he just gets destroyed cocaine bitches like this you know the vengeance of the turtle dude looks like a turtle I don't know what does he just you know you look at Mitch McConnell you're like turtle okay bitch though it's just glorious so we've had a great week we've had the Iran deal going on flame so we had Eric Schneiderman being revealed as the inhuman monster that he is and Don Blankenship loses but leaves us with the treasured memory that is cocaine Mitch so this has been a great week for Republicans oh yeah gosh I almost forgot how could I forget Mueller that Basset hailed looking freak he got slammed bright you know all for show right he decides well there are no collusion evidence I'm just gonna indict all these Russian individuals and companies and they'll never appear they're all in Russia I'm gonna indict them and see I've done some about collusion so he indict Saul these guys write anything they're never good I'm never gonna see him don't have to put up let's go on you know let's go look at you know maybe Trump dated a penthouse pet or whatever they are playmate I don't know one of them appears well them hires Reed Smith who's just a real lover it's a real good law firm hires them and says I know put in a criminal appearance in a corporation appears through it's a it says hi we we are appearing and we're you know not going to dispute jurisdiction and let's let's fight about this and mueller's like wait what and they appear and they say okay we are here now we are going to demand discovery we demand Muller all your evidence against us because being America an accused has a right to all the evidence against us but see mule he's got a problem he doesn't have any evidence because this is all baloney it's all a PR gets all a stunt it's all a scam so Muller on Friday you know they're supposed to be arraigned on Monday that's when they first make their appearance and they plead not guilty Muller on Friday Mueller's like Oh judge judge um judge we'd like to put this off because we don't really think they've appeared and the judges like what now he said what and that's craziness so just goes now they've appeared they're pleading not guilty and they're not waiving the right to a speedy trial put up or shut up mark my words this particular defendant one of the companies is gonna be dismissed because Muur ain't got nothing and then it gets even worse than of course last we had judge Ellis in the mana Ford case going why in a Russian collusion investigation you're looking at this guy's tax stuff from 2005 it seems to me like you're trying to pressure him to you know testify against the president and of course what happens if he doesn't have anything truthful to testify to well gosh he sure has a great incentive to make something up because Miller wants to send him way essentially for the rest of his life that's the scam you know Mueller's not gonna come out and go I want you to perjure yourself and invent stuff he's just gonna say yeah I throw your life in prison unless you come up with something well I don't have anything he didn't do anything wrong I guess you gotta present for life huh what are my options see the thing I love is the you know the the president maintains the power to pardon and he needs to pardon Flynn I probably needs to pardon at least one or two of these er guys and frankly it looks like maybe he should pardon man afford and and Cohen too because it's all lie it's all crap it's all a scam designed to manufacture evidence against them and now we got this federal judge who's saying it on the record of course everybody's like oh my gosh this is great so it's been a really good week oh wait there's more there's more North Korea it's happenin folks North Korea North Korea and I want to talk about this with Lee Salinas Ito is not just you know for the foreign policy guys it's for people like you it's for people like me it's for our families because if Donald Trump pulls us off if Donald Trump wins a piece in Korea that means tens of thousands of American families aren't going to be married burying their sons and daughters the last Korean war killed 54,000 Americans the next war well there's only 28,000 Americans over there but it'd be reinforced the next war would kill tens of thousands of Americans hundreds of thousands of South Koreans maybe millions of North Koreans and Donald Trump has a chance to make that not happen that something affects every one of us Donald affect a lot of the you know a lot of the types who are saying oh you know they can't let Trump win this thing because their kids aren't in the army your kids are in the air my kids would be in the army except they're like small but I served with a lot of guys in the army and I'm glad that there is a chance and I believe me I do not trust Kim out you know whatever the hell his name is as far as I can throw him and he's huge I can throw him very far but the fact is that this may save tens of thousands maybe even a million if it comes through and these people are willing to throw it away for short-term political advantage to get an edge over Trump I think it's disgusting so it's been a great week for America terrible week for Democrats but then I repeat myself well I'm here with one of my favorite people in the universe this is Selena Zito we are homies Burtt we homies yep we are we're from pencil talkie right western Pennsylvania roots I think yours comes from Donora and Carlisle yeah I had two Noren Chambersburg Chambersburg Wow it's always fun to be told I'm like the Sun of the south when the southerners burned down my hometown yeah what is a like the Confederates didn't really treat your the the land you come from with much respect or the people or the houses no no none of the above in fact the one of my earliest memories is going out to Gettysburg with my grandparents who you know lived all their lives in Chambersburg had picture of Abraham Lincoln on the wall and if you go onto Letterkenny army base which is a big base out there that's where the Schlichter family farm is and the Schlichter grave is still there graves and my great-great-grandfather Jacob has a Grand Army of the Republic bags on his grave hasn't been stolen it's bronze that is incredible I mean that's sort of what we when we talk about populism people that don't understand it immediately go to oh you're you know a son of the south or you're a racist and they don't understand that it's it has nothing to do with that and then and a lot of times it doesn't have to do with a lot with ideology and and it doesn't have to do with a person but it has to do with them and I think that and that's the one of the things that we talked about the great revolt it's not nationalism they're confusing it it's localism it's about being proud of where you are from and wanting it to have the same opportunities and dignity and dignity that the the people in the super zipcodes live in exactly now in the great revolt which you were nice enough to send me a copy and it it took me away from reading the fruits of my my book along similar lines called militant normals it was a pleasure mine is similar to yours in a lot of ways but more swearing well if you ever looked at my pen tweet you know I don't swear not at all but mainly because I always like okay whatever I say I have to think about my parents on one shoulder and my kids and my grandkids on the other shoulder so that's me well what's interesting about you Selina is you were unique in 29 2016 you went out and talked to people that no one else wanted to talk to so what are the things about 2016 like you're right I did go out to talk to people that people didn't want to talk to because they didn't want to listen to what they had to say and I'm talking about both political parties I think absolutely you know our teas did not want to hear them they didn't they they for whatever reason they decided they believed that what they were feeling and experiencing outside of the the super ZIP codes in this country that control the media better control the elections that not knock the election but that control politics and control Hollywood and the NFL they didn't want to have anything to do with opinions that are outside of theirs so they stopped the conversation immediately and say they're racist they're bigots well they're nationalists and I am still astounded today that we're in the middle of a movement and we're still not hearing what it has to say and that's why the great revolt is so important not only are these people impacting the ballot box but they're impacting culture they're impacting how we spend our money what we watch on television how we enjoy our sports did you see how much college football left up in the ratings and how much the NFL dropped that has to do with this coalition and it is incredibly enduring and they still don't want you you stand that so they call it racist or nationalism whatever or nostalgic whatever you know the word they can throw out so they can put the brakes on any conversation and and I sense why I think that it's important for everyone to read the book so that they understand it if they don't or they see themselves in it and say you know what that's me that's how I felt well you know as a resident of one of those super zip codes here on the beach in Los Angeles you know I let me let me take my perspective I was not seeing those folks look I'm a conservative ideologue read National Review I mean 30 years of this I was in the trenches I you know all the conservative you know checklist was stuff I believed and I still believe in it but you know I wasn't thinking about the guys who live you know 30 miles to the east of me I am you know as a hardcore conservative Republican I just wasn't thinking of them I didn't listen I was a big Trump opponent early on yeah I was a Ted Cruz supporter and then Ted lost and is it Sarah Trump or that monster I'll go for trump and then this guy did some revolution or he did what he said he was gonna do yeah the woods done that that's pretty astounding that I mean it's it's it's really astounding here's the thing this movement was never he never caused it he's the result of it yes and that's what makes it enduring it's bigger than him they don't want it to be though they want it to be all about Trump and if they can take him out with you know collusion Russians treason whatever they think that's the easy answer in fact I think uh I think some people will buy your book thinking that's an easy answer they want to read the book now I understand them now I don't have to do anything reading your book is only the first step well you gotta get to the last chapter where you see the way ahead yeah absolutely you know I don't I I think you're right I don't think they want to learn from it I think they want to get the idea oh now I understand them I'm do exactly the same things treat them with the exact same level of condescension in fact but now I understand them I I don't know if they'll work for them I well that's because they they think it's all about chump they don't understand it's all about the people it's all about the people that formed this coalition and sometimes coalition's do things that we don't like but but you know there are probably things within this coalition you know part you know - one of the different archetypes it'll say I don't like that but I like the rest of it I mean that's just sort of the way a coalition works and you know and also all coalition's break apart eventually but this one has the potential and the potency to be enduring because neither party is willing to to bring it in establishment Republican as Republicans are like oh no no no I can't do this yeah i well I never yeah like oh these people aren't ABCDE well if you keep making fun of them and you keep labeling them in accurately you are never going to get them as part of your coalition and their coalition then grows bigger it's conservative populist but there are some aspects in it that are more like a New Deal coalition and and that's where you see the end of Ryan ISM and and I I love Paul Ryan so it's not like the end of Ryan ISM that's because he needs to go it's just the end of that kind of fiscal conservative like that's that's the only litmus test you can pass that's kind of it's part of the coalition but it's not that part of the coalition I think I think the Paul Ryan side which I sympathize with in a lot of ways had a kind of wonky yeah yeah failure to connect with the kind of people you talk to look reading through the book what struck me is these are not Leave It to Beaver people necessarily what you call the King Cyrus could conservatives the religious ones I think in some ways are but you know you've got people with like four wives oh yeah ruffery founders or the hair Oasis montaj is lived yeah that's a nerd thing yeah these are people that have lived the rough rebounders out of all of the archetypes there's seven different archetypes and the great revolt of all the archetypes and they're the ones that make up this coalition of all of them they're the ones that were most likely to have voted for Obama twice yeah but first and they liked him personally but they did not benefit nor did their communities benefit from his policies so they were and they you know and they've had tragedies in their life whether it's economic tragedy personal tragedy illness whatever you know whatever it may be and so and they look at him and they say oh well this guy is one and failed and one and failed I get him and when he said something that's like with a little bit of hyperbole they think I probably put a said that too you know and so you have in all the seven archetypes that you know these these work these aren't just in a jungle oh if you look in the back of the book there's extensive polling that backs up absolutely everything that we found and those are probably the two most stressful weeks of my life for waiting for that amuse and extensive poll by the way polls are very expensive but um it was it was the most stressful time because I didn't while my gut told me this is what's happening I wanted to make sure I had the data to tell me to reaffirm it and you confirm it interesting the and and you did it but it's you know it's really the anecdotes that struck me you you've got the data but it's the antidote the people ask the Beulah County guys up near Wilkesboro not too far from where my family from uh and their life experiences which is very different from from mine you know bourbon guy and I you know I went to a pretty good college I did military that is one common thing I noticed a lot of these people who serve their country in uniform and I don't think that's a common experience I know it's not a common experience yeah let's do a Monday elite US military but you you go into where these stance of course you walk into a VFW and that's the swing and joy yeah that's that's that's where the people are and that's where they're mingling you know the the VFW in Redondo Beach is pretty desolate yeah there but there are suburbs in this country that did support him um there were just shy suburban women yep there were there were the girl gun power right these are one of my favorite favorite I'm married to one you know what you know my wife yeah yeah yeah I mean this is one of my favorite sort of archetypes right because she's suburban they're their suburban name children they're married their marriages are intact yep and they they believe and they're also identifies themselves as feminists and nothing is more empowering to them than to be ability to protect themselves by themselves they're in charge of their own lives and and they they voted on that issue like the Second Amendment was prevalent among all the archetypes whether they had a gun or not and as being and as being what drew them to Donald Trump I I think there's kind of a and it's there are certain qualities to real Americans and when I say real Americans I mean once you don't identify with a transnational elite I mean I don't think any of the I think the people if you had gone to those people into the bars and thiner z and VFW's where you talked to them and said show a hands who here considers himself a citizen of the world they probably would have looked at you like you were nuts yeah that's what the Localism comes in yeah I'm an American and I'm from Oh north northeast ohio yeah well yeah but but there are American - and they know they took 911 personally even if they'd never been to not New York City yeah that was yeah and you just you don't do that you know I think oh well the problems is a lot of our elite have never been in fistfights and you didn't talk to I bet you every single one of those guys has been at a bar fight yeah yeah yeah yeah somebody some I got in their face and and they there is a undercurrent I won't call it hostility but I'll call it militants to Americans you don't you don't tell Americans what to do and I I think what I got the sense from your book and your your discussions with these people is they're sick of people from far away trying to tell them who they are how they should live giving them grief yeah that one they want to be part of something bigger than themselves so aspiration is a very common thread among these voters people wrongly decided that make America great again was in nationalist phrase and or a negative or end or bitter phrase it's a very aspirational phrase people's Americans inherently want to be part of something bigger than themselves they want to feel connected with each other yes and that is not dinner and that is not anger and that and that make America great again was completely misunderstood if you lived in the super zip codes well one of the things that another of the things that struck me and a lot of things struck me about the book I was constantly struck I was instructed I was the first chapter with Bonnie the Baker who had a career and she starts out as a cook right at the police station works her way up to a deputy yeah and then she retires and she start baking she has a small business in a tough area where and I'm thinking what is the kind of optimism that leads you to do that these are you know you get this impression that these are these opioid addicted Hotel bitter losers you know sitting there bitterly drinking their bourbon and they do like their alcohol I know well as we found out with mr. Schneiderman so do the Olympics but I I don't see the guys you talk to you slapping around their dates and I don't see the women that you talk to not putting a bullet through their forehead if they tried but you know there's an optimism there to Americans that things can get better and they will even though you know you've had they've taken some shots yeah you must if you take and if you take a look at the end it shows that 84% of the not only the people that we interviewed but in the categories that they fall into the Trump supporters 84 percent believe that things will get better that are they are optimistic about the future of not only for their community but for themselves and for the country back that's not angry 80 percent well III think I think there's resentment and anger because they think they've been treated badly but there's also optimism they didn't vote for Donald Trump just to stick it and a finger a poke these guys in the eye though it's fun to poke them in the eye yeah they did it because they think Donald Trump was there hope to make things better I mean you look at a guy like Mitt Romney and he looks like the guy who comes by your plant and says fire 20% of the workers increase it the nice guy absolutely that's who we process but but you don't but you don't get the impression you just said you don't get the impression he has your back you actually get the impression that he's probably gonna cost you and or the guy that works beside you on the line their job well exactly and I don't think we use Republicans because I'm glad that Democrats are writing off this huge chunk of America tactically it's a huge Hilton and again why I want but for it is astounding but III think they're forced to by their own ideology they have to have a villain and they've made normal Americans their villain I think that's a pathology and I think it's a bad idea but I'm more concerned with the Republicans and I still see you know the jet flakes and the Benz asses who want to come out and dictate oh we're better to that than that to a guy who just came off working on the farm for nine hours and doesn't need some dude in a suit telling him what's what and telling him he shouldn't be angry when Danny is a right to be yeah like I said in the beginning neither this establishment the song not all you know there's some smart Democrats out there that that get it and they're wrong yeah Tim Ryan totally gets it Joe Biden is in Youngstown yeah Joe Biden I think that's it a little yeah it is owned by Denis way you know House used to get it who was Howard Dean this is a guy who was backed by the NRA this was a guy who made it a 50-state program for the Democratic Party he believed in expanding the universe and reaching out to me he did these incredible farm ads in 2006 in all these rural communities that's why they won those swing seats and he said tired of a politician saying this retired of a politician saying that don't you feel that you don't have a voice vote for this guy I mean how people do Democrats won't give him the credit he's jus because you know he was successful with moderate Republic Democrats and Republicans don't give him the credit largely Reince Priebus used to say look I'm following the Howard Dean movement the power gene playbook because he believed in doing all 50 states and that's what previous did as well Wow hey Selina I wish we had more time we could go on all day and we haven't even touched on western Pennsylvania and all that other stuff we have in common uh I I want first of all congratulations on the great success how'd it feel here's some everybody wants know how did it how did you find out that the president had tweeted that you should read everybody should read the great revolt how did you find out about had you fear well it's really fascinating so I done Fox and Friends in the morning even though that I work for CNN they allowed me to have two hits on Fox and I left there and went over to CNN and he did it while I was alive on television home on off on poppy Harlow and and we just started talking and she said Selena the the president just tweeted about you and I know it was gonna be a yeah right and then she read it and she said what are you thinking I don't even think I answered her because I think at that moment like my whole brain went to jello and and honestly I mean it's the President of the United States of course you're honored if the President of the United States says you know this book tells about your lives you know you didn't say this book is about me cuz it's not about you he said hey you guys this book is about you and you know well see I'll see what happens well I look I I've been watching it on Amazon the highest I've ever gotten is 238 you were at 46 last time I checked I bet you're even lower I couldn't be happier cuz you're one of the good ones you're one of the nice ones I am glad you're a friend a fellow Pennsylvania homey thanks so much for taking time for my my little mini podcast here hey how do you like my Bolin shirt get in touch with the I probably have a shirt looks just like that somewhere well I promise you I'm not wearing a tie Ellen actually I am an elk I'm a member of the Brotherhood of the outs you know if we had more people in the media who were members of bowling leagues for the Elks or the rotary or who want best maybe Donald Trump would support exactly so Elena what a pleasure thank you so much thank you so much now let's move on to something a little different I want to do something that I have not done before because I've only done like three or four of these I would like to review a movie I'd like to a review Avengers infinity war now there will be spoilers but I've gotta warn you you know you know if you haven't seen it I may reveal things now I have not seen the movie I've seen all the other movies because I have little kids but I think I can still talk about the conservative basis of the Marvel Universe and a little about what happens in infinity wars in a way that won't be a complete waste of your time we'll see in any case again if you're worried about spoilers let me get them right out of the way Superman died Spock dies han Solo dies and Luke your father is Captain Kirk so all those things are gonna happen in infinity Wars now infinity Wars involves a guy from space who's a liberal and he comes and he says you know essentially you know global warming and you use too many resources and basically for the good of the whole we have to kill pretty much half of everybody just because I think it's a good idea and it kind of makes me feel good certain people object most of them wearing tights and a lot of them with superpowers and there's lots of punching well I think first of all the basis of the Marvel Universe is important now a lot of these guys are liberals you know the Chris Pine or Chris Evans one of the Chris is he's like Captain USA and he has a shield in something and he's a liberal in real life and he'll be like tweeting things like you know citizens should be able to choose what guns they have people like me should choose I'm a movie star and you know it's stupid in the gay place the Hulk wig I think his name is Mark Ruffalo and he's just straight a Bernie commie and you know I mean but but the characters really have a conservative basis and let's look at first of all they fight evil liberals thought liberals embrace evil in the last week has taught you anything look at the giant suck-up hurry to the Iranians I mean it's not just well you know I believe Donald Trump has made a error in repudiating this non-treaty cuz it ain't a treaty this arrangement that Obama made with the Iranians because it's America to America's advantage for the following reasons they don't make that argument and say they're like America breaks just word is always America is terrible and all the foreigners hate it and and we should do what foreigners say they're just the worst they fight evil liberals tend to embrace it so you got people who are liberal playing people who have a conservative basis now if you saw Black Panther and I saw Black Panther and I actually like Black Panther first of all is an entertaining movie second one had a great couple of villains it had that like South African guy who was crazy he was a good villain it had what was his name kill monger which you know I wish could be my name kill monger and he was a great villain hey Abby he's a really good villain movies made by a villain and uh you know the hero was I don't remember his name he was the king of something but he was like you know a conservative King he's like you know we gotta listen to people and integrate various views and you know I'm not gonna be a dictator I'm not gonna tell people what to do here's an evil guy let's stop him that's kind of a conservative guy this there is a lot of conservative underpinnings to the whole Marvel Universe that goes on infinity Wars - and in infinity wars right you have this guy in his name's I think thermos and he comes from space and he looks like Mount Rushmore and he wants to get powers and lays the guy who wants to kill half of people because of the environment for some reason and they fight him and it's important that they fight because if you actually believe in something if sun's important if if freedom is important to defend if Liberty is important to defend it's important to be able to fight this these aren't pacifist movies it's around going you know it's probably wrong to space punch this guy it's right I'm wrong to use my laser eye machine thing or my magic spells or whatever I've got because they all have different powers to fight these guys they don't do that they're like these are bad guys and they got to be stopped and we're gonna stop we're gonna man up and stop them even the women are gonna man up and they use guns lots of guns and they're super cool you know you got the Black Widow chick and she's got Glocks and I'm a big fan of Austria and Firearms you've got there's a guy named beaver Bucky or something like that he's got a machine gun and everybody's got guns it's really cool because guns are an important part of every citizens toolkit for protecting freedom so these these movies really provide a conservative basis they identify evil which liberals don't really believe we just don't understand them you're evil because you're you know American they agree that we should fight evil vigorously you and I can do it at ballot box if necessary you can use it with our privately owned firearms Thank You founders for the Second Amendment and if you happen to be a superhero you can use it with your ability to freeze things or cause hurricanes or super punching which is a superhero thing I'm not good at this superhero stuff and I get a lot of grief because apparently there's more than one superhero universe and I keep asking things like so is Batman gonna fight spider-man and I get a lot of a lot of grief about that because apparently it's wrong in some way but I don't know I like Batman he's you know he dresses like a bat goddammit that's pretty cool so there is a conservative basis a conservative underpinning to infinity Wars and apparently at the end of infinity Wars like I said you know mr. Spock dies and it's that there's sacrifice because freedom and liberty aren't easy they're not if freedom and liberty were easy everybody would have freedom and liberty and then we really wouldn't like need a military we wouldn't need to defend ourselves because everyone would be pretty much a great in freedom and you know dignity but that's not the way the world is and the Marvel superhero universe recognizes that even if it's mindless actors babble liberal cliches so I guess what I'm saying is go out and see infinity Wars it's a as I understand it's about five and a half hours long I was at home the whole family went but I stayed home to write wildfire which is the third of my conservative shoot-'em-up books about the America broken apart and you should go by the first two which are People's Republic put that up there and Indian country and you know the technical guys can put a picture there you should go by this wildfires going to kick butt but that's why I didn't go see the movie but maybe I should because it sounds like a real conservative movie it's about the need to fight for freedom and the need to sacrifice for it and the need to use your superpowers and while we individually don't have superpower the United States is a superpower and it's a force for good and it's what's going to keep the world free not the Avengers or the defenders of the magnificent AIDS or seven or whatever they're called anyway that's my movie review of infinity worse I hope you liked it maybe I'll do more in the future I need you guys to comment you can comment on anything I say at Kurt Schlichter on Twitter I do read my tweets I do interact with people so get on there and say Kurt you were brilliant loved everything about it don't ever review a movie again stop talking your bowling shirt also great tribute to normal working Americans
