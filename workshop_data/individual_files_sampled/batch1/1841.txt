police officers gather at a factory gate just outside Bangkok they send up a drone to take a peek inside before scaling the wall and going in this is the latest in a series of raids on electronic waste factories for the past month the authorities have been cracking down on illegal operations and investigating imported tea waste some companies are bringing in more than their authorized to import and using illegal factories like this one it's the largest rate of its kind yet at least estimate that there are 6,000 tons of illegal waste in the sprawling compound only 7 company they can import but now we found out that five of seven they import not directly to the factory but to another ela con factory but importers have now had their licenses suspended for a year intelligence gained on previous raids led police here to this plastic facility it's not even registered to do this kind of work now this is a stack of old router fronts now there are thousands of stacks like this on this facility and it's clear that this particular one came from overseas on the back of them there is a sticker with an American customer service number on it customs officials say that the import of plastic material for recycling including a waste totals 200,000 tons for just the first five months of this year that's double the amount for all of last year I believe that it results from the ban from China in the importation to their country so the the exporting country tend to find some other countries to send to and Thailand might be one of those countries environmental group Greenpeace also thinks the Chinese ban has led to an increase they're concerned with the contamination electronic waste causes heavy metal and water and soil and airborne toxins but the more immediate concern there's no specific law that deals directly with a waste management so take into account the dumping of electronic we're from at the country that we don't have capacity we don't have fertility and we don't have infrastructure to to do that he says there's enough domestic waste to keep the current businesses open so there's no economic reason for Thailand to take in other countries garbage Scot Heidler al Jazeera Bangkok
