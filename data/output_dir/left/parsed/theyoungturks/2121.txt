NAFTA IS
BEING RENEGOTIATED
ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT.
THERE IS ONE PORTION IN
PARTICULAR THAT HAS TO DO WITH
JUNK FOOD AND LABELING OF JUNK
FOOD.
>>OF COURSE IT DOES.
I KNOW PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON
CONSIDER ME RADICAL LEFT
BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE ON TO ME
BEING A MODERATE.
DO I BELIEVE IN FREE TRADE?
YES.
BUT OF COURSE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT
IS IN THE TRADE DEAL.
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO
TARIFFS.
THE ALUMINUM AND STEEL
TARRIFS TRUMP DID ARE GOING TO
BACKFIRE AND HURT OUR ECONOMY.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD
HANDOFF CARTE BLANCHE ALL
OUR NEGOTIATIONS TO
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS.
THEY DON'T HAVE OUR BEST
INTEREST AND LOT MIND.
BY LAW THEY MUST HAVE THEIR OWN
BEST INTEREST IN MIND.
THEY ARE THERE TO MAXIMIZE
PROFITS IN THE SO-CALLED FREE
TRADE DEALS ARE IN REALITY JUST
TO LET CORPORATIONS WRITE
THE RULES.
AND OF COURSE THEY SAY WE ARE
DOING AN IMPORTANT TRADE
DEAL, MEXICO AND CANADA MIGHT
WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY
DON'T LABEL HER FOOD.
WHO IS ACTUALLY WRITING THE LAW?
THE CORPORATIONS.
>> LIKE 100% EXPLICITLY.
THIS PREEMPTS THE OTHER
COUNTRIES.
THE COUNTRIES THAT WERE DOING
THESE PACKS WITH, IT KEEPS
THEM FROM MAKING THEIR OWN LAWS
WHICH IF SOMEONE DID THAT
TO US YOU KNOW THEY WOULD BE
SUPER UPSET ABOUT.
>>WHAT THIS DOES AND THAT IS
WHY CONSERVATIVES SHOULD BE
FURIOUS ABOUT IT.
NOW WHAT IS HE DOING?
NAFTA
HAND OVER CORPORATE POWER.
WHY ARE CONSERVATIVES
FURIOUS ABOUT IT?
BECAUSE IT TAKES AWAY OUR
SOVEREIGNTY.
IT'S AS IF AMERICAN CITIZENS ARE
NOT IN CHARGE.
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS ARE
IN CHARGE OF OUR LAWS TO
MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFITS,
SOMETIMES AT A COST TO ALL OF
US.
AND THAT IS WHAT IS WRONG WITH
THESE TRADE DEALS.
