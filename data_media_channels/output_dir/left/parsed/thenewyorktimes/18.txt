Deep in the mud,
they find one — a body.
It appears to be a young girl,
but her head is missing.
No one will know her name.
She’s brought here:
a mass grave
on the outskirts of town.
This is Palu, Indonesia.
It’s been almost two weeks
since an earthquake
and tsunami ravaged this city.
Thousands of buildings
collapsed, 20-foot waves
crashed into the shore.
In places, the soil
flowed like liquid,
sweeping away
entire neighborhoods.
More than 2,000 have died.
Now, officials say about
5,000 are still missing.
We came here to
meet the survivors.
Everyone was searching
for someone.
Soon, the government will
end the formal search
for human remains.
It’s clear that there’s
no one left to save.
But people here wait and watch,
hoping at least for a chance
to bury their dead.
Riana Asnuwair is looking
for her mother.
Ismail is a taekwondo coach.
Eight of his students
are still missing.
He’s here every day.
At the end of another hard day,
a family buries its dead.
Zulkifli watched as the
earth swallowed his wife
and 7-year-old son.
Nine days later, rescuers
found their bodies.
They were still
holding each other.
In such a broken place,
this is what’s left to hope for:
a chance to say goodbye.
