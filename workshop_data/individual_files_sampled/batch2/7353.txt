now the Trump's in a panic screaming about how there's no collusion and we should be investigating Hillary Clinton and Jimmy Carter and Grover Cleveland so we're of course now worried about what the next steps he might take are Preet Bharara was the person in charge of the US Attorney's Office in New York very important position he was one of the people that were let go by Donald Trump potentially because pre Brora was investigating parts of the Trump team now at that time I wouldn't say that that was grounds to get ready for investigating Trump because he did have a right to get rid of Barrera and normally do replace those US attorneys he did it with very questionable timing but okay no problem so Brauer goes on television now and explains how investigations like this might unfold what are the things Trump might do and what are the consequences of that so let's watch so we know from history in recent months that the President of the United States you know has strong reactions to public events if the President of the United States is sending some kind of message to the potential defendant or other witnesses and that that's in two categories one is he's sending a message of intimidation in some way through himself or his cohorts suggesting that people should not be talking and people should keep their mouth shut which you know happens in life from time to time and the second thing is whether or not he sends a message of reassurance so that would be obstruction of justice and it it wouldn't made the case any better for Donald Trump it would arguably make it worse because if he's trying to intimidate witnesses in public through Twitter or any other statements that he makes that is potentially a disastrous idea and could lead the obstruction of justice charges now if pre Brora had a grudge against Trump he certainly shouldn't be publicizing this on television but a generally mad ACCA's Trump can't help himself he's a petulant child so a book oh yeah I'll do the obstruction anyway and plus he's in such a panic and he knows what the rest of us don't know which is how deep his ties to the Russians actually go so he might have to do these things that land him in trouble for justice anyway because the Justice is what he's worried about okay what another point here made by Barrera on what could happen next we also have from the historical record in recent months that Donald Trump will avoid going through the regular process for pardoning someone who's an ally in this case it was Joe Arpaio the sheriff in Arizona and there has been much speculation about whether or not Donald Trump would hesitate to use his pardon power to get out of legal jeopardy and trouble any allies of his and that's something I would watch very very closely here see that right there would be the most unacceptable and because if you allow a president to pardon anyone who is part of wrongdoing connected to himself that means we don't have a democracy anymore and we don't have a president we have a king and we're gonna let him get away with any crime so that is exactly when Congress should in a bipartisan manner pursue impeachment no ands ifs or buts in fact we had a petition on this a while back and time to double up on this in a big big way it's TYT Network calm slash pardon and we're saying if Donald Trump pardons anyone from his campaign or administration involved in Russia investigation he should be impeached immediately because if you let him get away with that it's all over that means he can pardon everyone who is guilty and just not step down there's there's no end to that and then we are no longer in a democracy so Brora is absolutely right to sound the alarm about that it would be obstruction of justice it would get him in more legal trouble but then he would just pardon himself so the minute he pardons anyone if he does that in in tied to this investigation it should be obvious immediate impeachment and we should all be in the streets I mean sign the petition now but if that happens we cannot let that stand that would be deeply on American and would ruin ruin our form of government one more front here from Barrera this argument that Muller should resign we're hearing more and more from the president's allies on Capitol Hill from their obedient vassals in the in the media what's your take on well it's what a coincidence right Jake that as Bob Muller is getting his job done and as he's getting closer to doing something that's real and filing charges that political allies of the president are calling for his resignation of course of course they are and and that's part of the reason why they brought up this uranium one stuff from years and years ago because they want to be able to say um Muller was in the administration when that was happening he's got a conflict of interest which is something Trump tweeted Trump is basically manufacturing on Twitter publicly his defense and then the Sean Hannity's and and Fox are friends and all those guys there and a lot of the Republican Congressmen are going out there dutifully going okay here's how we're gonna obstruct justice the guy investigating the president who is now found wrongdoing twelve count indictment as mana Ford and gates and you've got a Papadopoulos that has already pled guilty and turned evidence it doesn't matter we're gonna try to get rid of the guy doing the investigation robert muller if that's not a sign that he's guilty then you're not paying attention or you don't want to see it i don't know why you don't want to see it maybe because you're a trump supporter and don't care or you've just lost your mind but it is clear that they're in the middle of publicly trying to obstruct justice there's usually a very good reason for that it's usually because they're afraid of what they'll get if there actually is justice help us build independent media together TYT Network comm /join
