1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,980
IS THIS THE WORST PROMPOSAL
EVER?

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,930
IT IS PROM SEASON AT HIGH
SCHOOLS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:11,600
PEOPLE ARE GETTING US TO PROMPT
AND THIS HAPPENED AT A

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,720
HIGH SCHOOL, AN 18

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,410
YEAR OLD WHO IS SUBSTANTIALLY IN
LOVE WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND OR GIRL

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,060
HE WANTED US TO PROMPT AND SO HE
WENT AND MADE A SIGN FOR HER.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,109
WHAT DID THAT SIGN LOOK LIKE?

8
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:26,029
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

9
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:31,800
IT SAYS IF I WAS BY, I'D BE
PICKING COTTON, BUT I'M WHITE,

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,230
SO I'M PICKING YOU FOR PROM.

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,050
WHAT A STUPID SIGN.

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:44,890
FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS THE LEAST
CREATIVE, SMART WAIT TO DO A

13
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,440
PROPOSAL. HE RAN OUT OF SPACE
WITH THE STENCILS AND HAD TO

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,430
WRITE PROM IN SMALL LETTERS.

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,550
HE USED THE WRONG GRAMMAR.

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,510
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE CUTE.

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,510
LIKE A JOKE.

18
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:01,109
I KNOW, I AM GOOD EVOKE OUR
NATIONAL SHAME AND DO IT POORLY.

19
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,109
THAT WILL GET HER.

20
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:05,309
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
CHRONOLOGICALLY.

21
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,970
YOU WOULD NOT BE CURRENTLY
PICKING COTTON.

22
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,530
YOU HAVE SO MUCH TIME MAKING A
SIGN LIKE THAT TO DECIDE TO

23
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,300
YOURSELF, THAT IS A BAD IDEA.

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:23,300
BUT SHE PUT UP THE HEART
EMOJI SO I THINK IT WORKED OUT

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,300
REALLY?

26
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,100
THIS IS FROM A SNAP. ON
THE GIRL'S SNAP PROFILE AND AT

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:38,010
THE VERY BOTTOM, IT IS
TWO HEART EMOJIS.

28
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,010
SHE LOVED IT.

29
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,790
SHE SAID YES.

30
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,860
OH THAT'S TRUE, IF YOU ARE
BLACK, YOU WOULD BE PICKING

31
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,940
COTTON.

32
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,960
THAT IS SUCH A GOOD POINT, I
WOULD LOVE TO GO TO PROM WITH

33
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,960
YOU.

34
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,909
MY PROBLEM IS THE NON SEQUITUR.

35
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:55,820
HE IS A KID, I WILL CUT A LITTLE
SLACK ON THE RUNNING

36
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,070
OUT OF SPACE.

37
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,390
RUNNING OUT OF A SPACE ON THE
SIGN, I HAVE BEEN THERE.

38
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,350
I WOULD ARGUE IT IS TOO
CREATIVE.

39
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,729
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO GO THERE.

40
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,939
HE DID THE DUMBEST THING
HE COULD.

41
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:10,530
ON SO MANY LEVELS.

42
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,629
ROSES ARE RED, VIOLETS ARE BLUE,
SUGAR IS SWEET, AND SO ARE YOU.

43
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:18,900
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING, IT
DOESN'T RELATE SO MAYBE THAT

44
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,480
IS HIM LIKE, WHAT IS IT RELATED
TO YOU GOING TO PROM BUT

45
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,390
PROVIDES A NICE RHYME?

46
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,709
IT DOESN'T EVEN RHYME.

47
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,230
IT IS JUST SO WEIRD.

48
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,349
IT IS ALMOST NOT RACIST AT A
CERTAIN POINT.

49
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:33,129
THAT IS A REALLY INTERESTING
QUESTION.

50
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:38,250
BUT, IT IS A SMALL STORY, BUT IT
GOES TO SHOW THE MINDSET IN

51
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,300
SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE
THEY READ THE SIGN.

52
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,480
LIKE BRETT SAID, HE PROBABLY
TOOK 30 MINUTES TO WRITE IT,

53
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,490
THIS IS

54
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,050
STILL A GOOD IDEA.

55
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,230
STILL A GOOD IDEA.

56
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,110
APPARENTLY IT WAS BECAUSE
SHE SAID YES.

57
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,959
THIS IS NOT A FEDERAL CRIME.

58
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,260
HE IS A KID.

59
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,019
IS IT EVEN RACIST?

60
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,769
IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS RACIST.

61
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:04,640
IF A 38-YEAR-OLD MAN HELD A SIGN
AND WAS RUNNING FOR POLITICAL

62
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,670
OFFICE, THAT IS A DIFFERENT
CONVERSATION BUT IN THIS CASE,

63
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,239
IT IS ALMOST SO DUMB THAT IT
FEELS A LITTLE INNOCENT.

64
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:12,239
WHAT YOU THINK?

65
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,840
I DO NOT THINK IT IS INNOCENT, I
THINK IT IS JUST DUMB.

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,380
I AM GOING TO MAKE A JOKE ABOUT
COTTON PICKING, A TOPIC THAT I

67
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,550
AM ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT AND
EVERYONE IS ALWAYS THINKING

68
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,550
ABOUT.

69
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,409
THIS IS SO GREAT, SHE IS GOING
TO LOVE THIS PROM PROPOSAL.

70
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:34,550
MY INSTINCT IS, CAN WE GO TO THE
PHOTO AGAIN OF THE KID HIMSELF.

71
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,340
SEE HIS SHOES, HOW HE IS WEARING
THOSE TOP SIDERS WITH NO SOCKS

72
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,340
ON?

73
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,440
THAT MEANS HE IS EXTRA WHITE.

74
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,140
HE IS SUPER WHITE.

75
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,870
THAT IS EXTRA WHITE WITH A
HIGH OF A SHORT.

76
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,269
THERE'S PROBABLY A PLEAT
INVOLVED.

77
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:54,360
HIS APOLOGY WAS STUPID TOO.
LIKE I AM SORRY IF I

78
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,390
OFFENDED YOU, WHICH IS NOT
AN APOLOGY.

79
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:01,299
NEVER ACCEPTED THAT APOLOGY,
IF I OFFENDED YOU.

80
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:05,930
IT IS JUST NOT A FEDERAL
CASE, I AM KEEPING IT REAL

81
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,269
BECAUSE I HAVE DONE A LOT OF HIS
DRUGS, NOT THE CRAZY SIGN, BUT

82
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:11,381
I WORE THOSE SHOES IN
HIGH SCHOOL.

83
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:15,940
I DID, AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT
I AM NOT EXTRA WHITE.

84
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,940
REALLY?

85
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,459
THEY JUST LOOK SO WHITE TO ME.

86
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,030
MAYBE IT IS AN EAST COAST
THING AND THE BOTTOM LINE IN

87
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,590
ALL OF THIS IS WE TALK ABOUT IT
SO THAT THE NEXT TIME SOME KID

88
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,650
IS THINKING OF DOING A SIGN
THEY GO YOU KNOW WHAT?

89
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,280
MAYBE THAT IS A STUPID IDEA.

90
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,240
MAYBE PEOPLE, SOME PEOPLE
WILL TAKE IT AS REALLY OFFENSIVE

91
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,090
AND MAY BE VERY LOGICALLY SO AND
OTHERS WILL NOT BE SO OFFENDED

92
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,680
BUT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
LEGITIMATELY OFFENDED, I DO NOT

93
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,290
WANT TO OFFEND THEM, UNLESS YOU
DO IN WHICH CASE, THAT IS A

94
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,410
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION.

95
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,810
HE IS PROBABLY NOT THE MOST
RACIALLY SENSITIVE HUMAN BEING

96
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,580
AND WE CAN EDUCATE THEM, THERE
IS A ROBO CALL THAT WENT OUT

97
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,760
FROM THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION

98
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:10,550
SAYING:

99
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:23,850
TREVOR HARVEY OF THE LOCAL
NAACP CHARTER SAID:

100
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,420
THEY SAID THAT THE SCHOOL BOARD
IMPLIED THEY WERE GOING TO DO

101
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,510
JOINT TRAINING SIMILAR TO WHAT
HAPPENED AT STARBUCKS WHEN THEY

102
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,100
SAID THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A

103
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,930
SENSITIVITY TRAINING, WHAT IS
IT, SUBCONSCIOUS BIAS TRAINING

104
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,120
IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL
CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS TO KIND OF

105
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,330
GET THE MESSAGE ACROSS THAT THIS
IS NOT OKAY BUT LAST QUESTION.

106
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,890
DOES HE GO TO PROM OR IS HE
NOT ALLOWED TO?

107
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,390
HE HAS TO GO TO PROM AND HIS
CLASSMATES HAVE TO LOOK AT HIM

108
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,860
AND MAKE HIM KNOW THAT HE
IS STUPID.

109
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,720
HE HAS TO SANDWICH
BOARD THE SIGN.

110
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,360
DO NOT DO THAT.

111
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,900
DON'T BRING THE SIGN ANYWHERE,
LET'S BE DONE WITH THAT A

112
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,930
I THINK HE NEEDS TO
FEEL THE SHAME.

113
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,670
MY FINAL THOUGHT OF ON IT IS
THE RIGHT WING WILL

114
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,120
SAY, I DON'T WANT TO BE
SENSITIVE.

115
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,600
BUT THEY ARE KIDS, WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO TEACH AND THE

116
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,460
RIGHT THING SO I THINK IT MAKES
PERFECT SENSE FOR THE SCHOOL

117
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,180
TO SAY, LOOK, THIS REALLY HURTS
A LOT OF PEOPLE AND YOU WANT

118
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,180
TO HURT PEOPLE?

119
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,500
IF YOU DO, THAT IS A DIFFERENT
CONVERSATION, BUT IF YOU

120
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,010
DON'T, UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS
HURTFUL AND THE HISTORY BEHIND

121
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,030
THAT AND WHY PEOPLE ARE REALLY
LEGITIMATELY OFFENDED BY THAT

122
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,080
SO THAT YOU DO NOT MAKE THE SAME
MISTAKE WHEN YOU ARE AN ADULT

123
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,110
AND ALAN THE WORLD BECAUSE IT
CAN COST YOU A JOB, BESIDES

124
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,170
WHICH, CAN MAKE PEOPLE ANGRY AND
AGAIN, I HOPE YOU DO NOT

125
00:06:38,170 --> 00:00:00,000
ACTUALLY WANT TO DO THAT.
