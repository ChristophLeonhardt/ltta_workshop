open societies and closed and repressive systems it is time that we expose those who glamorize and apologize in the service of communist authoritarian and repressive governments regimes who torture and slave oppress and murder their people even in the United States and in other free nations some journalists academics public officials and saddest of all young people have developed and promulgated idealized warped views of tyrannical regimes Wow some of what now X National Security Adviser HR McMaster said last week at the Atlantic Council for his final speech in his post as he left the West Wing on Friday McMaster was applauded by hundreds of cheering White House and national security staffers press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that McMaster and his family were greeted by President Trump who thanked the three-star general for his service meanwhile Fred Hiatt writes about McMasters final speech in a piece for The Washington Post he writes in part this McMasters warning was more global his estimation of the stakes more existential and his vision so far removed from Trump's values values free zero-sum approach to America in the world that it came across as a call to action to everyone else who may be called upon to defend democracy ordinarily at such a time the world would look to America for leadership but Freedom House said the United States has retreated from its traditional role as both the champion and an exemplar of democracy that retreat has been woven from dozens of statements policy changes and missed opportunities from a president who famously seems to admire and yes glamorize dictators more than Democrats cheering when China's ruler declared himself president for life laughing with the Philippines strong man as he demonized reporters congratulating Egypt's dictator for his sham reelection itching to withdraw from Syria to leave that field to Iran and abandoning human rights improvement as a policy objective anywhere in the world proposing to cut funding for the National Endowment for democracy failing to nominate an Assistant Secretary of State for democracy human rights and labor and so on and so on and someone that's just part of the list and Richard we didn't even if Fred didn't even have we didn't put in fact serves him congratulating Vladimir Putin for his victory in his sham election even after he was told in in all caps not to do that the New York Times also writing a piece this weekend about democracy and retreat in Central and Eastern Europe it's also the theme of the new issue of our magazine of Foreign Affairs there is a democratic recession in the world for lots of reasons some economic some because of the immigration point you made before but the United States is no longer setting an example that others want to emulate the United States is no longer making the promotion and respect for democracy and human rights part of its foreign policy we now have an immoral foreign policy than in this context as people like me would argue is or immoral and this is a show there's a gray area between what we're doing now which is doing nothing and saying the the only purpose of American foreign policy is to transform the world and get everybody reading the Federalist Papers in their local language there is something in between we've walked away from it the only problem with HR McMaster speech is he did it as he was leaving the White House it would have been a hell of a lot better if he did it as he was walking it's just like Republicans who are retiring doing the same thing James Travis I guess I don't expect you to weigh in on this I'm just as I toss to you to see what you think of Fred hi it's column I I just think people in liberal democracies and from a liberal tradition need to understand so much of what's happened in America and so much what's is what's happened in Europe also is a reaction because European countries have refused speaking of gray zones to take a middle ground on immigration where it's open up open up the borders have an EU where somebody can come in in one country and go across 27 other countries and the people a lot of people a lot of labour voters in Britain said enough that's why they voted the way they voted they did in brexit there has been no middle ground on immigration and that has caused political chaos in Europe and it's caused some chaos here in the United States as well not talking about closing the borders but there is a middle ground that liberal democracies over the past 20 years have refused to take on immigration and this is the result absolutely right Joe and and let's think of it this way there's an idealistic let's do the right thing let's take care of the world component to this and that's important but I think there's a very pragmatic reason that the United States ought to be taking these kind of positions and if we look back in history it's kind of instructive if you go back about a hundred years ago World War one is ending what does the United States do we reject the League of Nations the predecessor to the United Nations we erect walls called tariff barriers the hawley-smoot tariff and we withdraw we come back home to America how'd that turn out well we cracked the global economy can you spell trade war and we allowed a plumb line that you could drop down to fascism leads directly to the Second World War there are idealistic reasons we ought to be pursuing these kind of policies but the realistic ones the pragmatism is a strong component in this and I fear when we come back and build walls on our border we erect tariff barriers we need to be thinking more about how we connect with the world not how we withdraw from it that's the real depression its connectivity and working with other nations that's what really worries me as I look at the international scene today and I think I think me the the mistake that Donald Trump made heatedly there's a mistake of seeing the United States doing things they start with a Marshall Plan I guess I think in 47 looking that as a gift to Europe when actually I not to not just sort of let the secret out we didn't do that just for Europe we did that for our own self-interest to stop the spread of communism to France to Italy to stop the spread of communism across Europe so why we we created so much of the post-war order in you know 47 48 49 and it has worked and it's not welfare for Europe and the rest of the world it's a very pragmatic tough-minded investment in democracy for not only the benefit of the world but for the benefit of us and the list that Fred Hiatt had in that piece we're gonna feel that for years maybe even decades to come Admiral James to read us thank you very much and still ahead president Trump attacked the Washington Post again yesterday this time he was critical of a report about John Kelly's diminishing influence in the White House we'll talk to one of the authors by the way did you see a rocker did you see that poll that Fox News showed yesterday I think over the weekend about it's really something like so it shows who do you trust more CNN or Trump CNN 48 Trump 35 who do you trust more MSNBC are Trump MSNBC 445 president Trump 32 who do you trust more Fox or president Trump Fox 30 Donald Trump 20 Donald Trump is is is less trusted then those that he attacks and the more he attacks them the stronger they get this is just straight out of a new hope strike me down and that was a team Jonathan you only make me did you see on Meet the Press yesterday the Peter Navarro it to
