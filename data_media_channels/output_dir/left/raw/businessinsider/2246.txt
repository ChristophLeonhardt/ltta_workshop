1
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:15,139
as two different emotions you know this

2
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:19,550
fear there's panic and fear could be

3
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,380
your friend you know as<font color="#E5E5E5"> long as as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,870
are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to control fear you are the</font>

5
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,610
word you know you concentrated you your

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,570
focus soon as fear turns into panic you

7
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:35,269
lose it Felix it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> about eight</font>

8
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:38,179
months since<font color="#E5E5E5"> your supersonic jump do you</font>

9
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:41,890
still dream or have nightmares about it

10
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,570
well never never<font color="#E5E5E5"> had nightmares about</font>

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,670
red bull stratos and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I never</font>

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,589
dreamed about it anymore so it kind of

13
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:51,170
looks like i have done it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i take it off</font>

14
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,210
my list and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is in heaven you</font>

15
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,510
know it's in peace and to prepare<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

16
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,789
the mission<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mentioned that you spoke</font>

17
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,559
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> neil armstrong can you tell me about</font>

18
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:06,229
the conversation you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> with him well</font>

19
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:07,939
we talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of things but but</font>

20
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,909
stuff that was really interesting to me

21
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,979
was what did she eat the night before

22
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:14,810
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you pee and he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> told me that</font>

23
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">the astronauts always preferred to go to</font>

24
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,310
space went to the moon

25
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,290
bacon eggs so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to eat steak</font>

26
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,110
and eggs and first time I tried it was a

27
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,399
two o'clock in the morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> because this</font>

28
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:26,750
is where I have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show up Mission</font>

29
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,880
Control out of a sitting in front of my

30
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,740
plate and a look at the steak and<font color="#E5E5E5"> eggs</font>

31
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,420
could not eat it you know two o'clock<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

32
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,270
the morning it's not the right breakfast

33
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,070
in my opinion what specifically do you

34
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,500
do to calm yourself down there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

35
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,549
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things that you can do you</font>

36
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:44,869
know breathing is one thing thinking

37
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:48,079
about good<font color="#E5E5E5"> things might help what's the</font>

38
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,179
good thing you think about what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

39
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:51,560
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about success if I'm in a</font>

40
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,990
difficult situation like sitting in a

41
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,240
capital for so many hours going up to

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,630
space means you mean to change your very

43
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,459
friendly environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a hostile</font>

44
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,799
environment with higher you go up the

45
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,450
less oxygen in half or less pressure you

46
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,849
have you far away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from any medical</font>

47
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:10,818
treatment and it scares here there's a

48
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:12,349
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about that when</font>

49
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:13,670
you're seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the captor two and a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> half</font>

50
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,640
hours so I was always<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I had that</font>

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of feeling like her hip here comes</font>

52
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,720
up like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only have to control it</font>

53
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,280
through I will think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that moment</font>

54
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,590
when i land everything is over<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm</font>

55
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,359
falling down<font color="#CCCCCC"> on my knees and then I'm</font>

56
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:30,200
going to be successful so that outlook

57
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,700
turning red bull stratos in the

58
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,890
successful mission brought my system

59
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,720
down

60
00:02:34,720 --> 00:00:00,000
you
