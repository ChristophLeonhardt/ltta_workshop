1
00:00:00,671 --> 00:00:01,872
HER DISAPPEARANCE HAS GAINED

2
00:00:01,873 --> 00:00:03,540
NATIONAL ATTENTION AS THE

3
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:07,911
SEARCH FOR HER RAMPS UP.

4
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:13,283
ALLY.

5
00:00:13,284 --> 00:00:14,951
A BIG YEAR FOR REPRESENTATIVE

6
00:00:14,952 --> 00:00:16,787
DESANTIS WHO WILL BE A GREAT

7
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:17,387
GOVERNOR FOR FLORIDA.

8
00:00:17,388 --> 00:00:18,889
A GOOD RACE GOING ON.

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,524
STRONG ON CRIME, BORDERS AND

10
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:24,261
CUTS.

11
00:00:24,262 --> 00:00:26,229
LOVES OUR MILITARY AND VETS AND

12
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,965
HAS MY TOTAL ENDORSEMENT.

13
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:30,367
RONNA McDANIEL IS HERE TO TALK

14
00:00:33,638 --> 00:00:34,104
PUTNAM.

15
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:35,639
SEEMS THE RACE HAS CHANGED.

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,374
PUTNAM HAD A LEAD IN THE

17
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:37,707
POLLING.

18
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,810
A LOT OF UNDECIDED BUT IT

19
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:40,811
BROKEN IN DESANTIS'S FAVOR.

20
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:42,813
HOW DO YOU SEE IT RIGHT NOW?

21
00:00:42,814 --> 00:00:43,747
>> YOU'RE SEEING WHERE THE

22
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:44,915
ENERGY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

23
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,116
IS RIGHT NOW.

24
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:47,717
IT IS SOLIDLY BEHIND THE

25
00:00:47,718 --> 00:00:49,486
PRESIDENT.

26
00:00:49,487 --> 00:00:51,121
AND AS HE HAS ENDORSED IN THE

27
00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:52,389
RACES YOU'VE SEEN A SHIFT FOR

28
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,490
THE CANDIDATES HE SUPPORTED.

29
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:56,760
YOU SAW IT LAST WEEK IN GEORGIA

30
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:57,694
WITH KEMP.

31
00:00:57,695 --> 00:01:03,433
YOU'VE SEEN IT WITH McMASTER IN

32
00:01:03,434 --> 00:01:05,702
SOUTH CAROLINA AND KATE

33
00:01:07,472 --> 00:01:08,738
AND GIVES THEM A BOOST.

34
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:11,208
YOU SEE IT IF FLORIDA.

35
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,609
>> Bill: YOU HEARD KELLYANNE

36
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,277
CONWAY PUT THE ODDS ON

37
00:01:14,278 --> 00:01:15,679
REPUBLICANS KEEPING THE CONTROL

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,379
OF CONGRESS.

39
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:16,646
50%.

40
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:18,248
A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT FEEL THAT

41
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:20,350
WAY BUT WE CAME ACROSS A FEW

42
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:23,153
HEADLINES TODAY THAT GAVE US A

43
00:01:23,154 --> 00:01:23,520
QUESTION.

44
00:01:28,126 --> 00:01:29,493
MID-TERM ELECTIONS FEAR RISES.

45
00:01:29,494 --> 00:01:33,163
WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE "WALL

46
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:34,798
STREET JOURNAL." TRUMP MIGHT

47
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,933
NOT MIND SPEAKER PELOSI AS A

48
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:38,301
POLITICAL FOIL FOR 2020.

49
00:01:38,302 --> 00:01:39,836
HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE PIECES?

50
00:01:39,837 --> 00:01:41,571
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

51
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:42,973
>> THE PRESIDENT IS ALL IN ON

52
00:01:42,974 --> 00:01:44,608
KEEPING THE MAJORITY IN THE

53
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:44,908
HOUSE.

54
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:46,309
WE KNOW NANCY PELOSI WOULD BE A

55
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,911
DISASTER FOR OUR COUNTRY.

56
00:01:47,912 --> 00:01:49,779
SHE CALLED THE TAX CUTS THAT

57
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,248
HAVE INCREASED PAYCHECKS FOR

58
00:01:51,249 --> 00:01:52,582
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS CRUMBS.

59
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,885
SHE IS COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH.

60
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:56,286
SHE WILL BRING IMPEACHMENT

61
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:56,686
PROCEEDINGS.

62
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:57,587
THESE AREN'T THINGS WE WANT.

63
00:01:57,588 --> 00:01:59,589
WE KNOW THE HISTORY.

64
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,624
THERE ARE 23 DISTRICTS WHERE

65
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,925
HILLARY CLINTON WON WHERE WE

66
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:03,326
HAVE REPUBLICANS THAT EITHER

67
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:04,728
HELD THOSE SEATS OR CURRENTLY

68
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:05,829
IN THOSE SEATS.

69
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,999
WE KNOW THAT TYPICALLY THE

70
00:02:10,168 --> 00:02:12,269
LOSES SEATS IN THE FIRST

71
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:12,736
ELECTION.

72
00:02:12,737 --> 00:02:14,371
WE'RE WORKING TO DEFY HISTORY

73
00:02:14,372 --> 00:02:15,805
AND WHY WE'VE RAISED RECORD

74
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:16,239
MONEY.

75
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,407
WE JUST COMPLETED OUR NATIONAL

76
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:19,543
WEEK OF ACTION WHERE WE HAD

77
00:02:19,544 --> 00:02:21,511
4,000 PEOPLE KNOCKING ON DOORS

78
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:22,812
CONTACTING TWO MILLION VOTERS.

79
00:02:22,813 --> 00:02:23,980
WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST

80
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:26,650
AND HAVE A RECORD TO RUN ON

81
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:27,517
WITH RECORD UNEMPLOYMENT WITH

82
00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:29,352
ISIS ON THE RUN.

83
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:35,592
THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN TAKE TO

84
00:02:35,593 --> 00:02:36,293
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS

85
00:02:36,294 --> 00:02:37,794
DELIVERABLES AND SAY THIS IS

86
00:02:37,795 --> 00:02:38,562
WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED IN A

87
00:02:38,563 --> 00:02:39,796
YEAR AND A HALF.

88
00:02:39,797 --> 00:02:40,830
LET'S NOT TURN BACK THE CLOCK

89
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:46,670
AND SEND IT BACK TO THE

90
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:48,939
PELOSI/SCHUMER DARK AGES.

91
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,274
>> Bill: THE TWEET FROM THE

92
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:51,741
WHITE HOUSE.

93
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:54,277
THE KOCH BROTHERS WHO HAVE

94
00:02:54,278 --> 00:02:55,912
BECOME A JOKE ARE AGAINST

95
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:57,247
STRONG BORDERS AND POWERFUL

96
00:02:57,248 --> 00:02:57,547
TRADE.

97
00:02:57,548 --> 00:02:59,416
I DON'T NEED THEIR MONEY OR BAD

98
00:02:59,417 --> 00:02:59,716
IDEAS.

99
00:02:59,717 --> 00:03:02,419
THEY LOVE MY TAX AND REGULATION

100
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,920
CUTS, JUDICIAL PICKS AND MORE.

101
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:06,890
I MADE THEM RICHER.

102
00:03:06,891 --> 00:03:12,762
THEY ARE NET -- I'M FOR AMERICA

103
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:13,930
FIRST AND THE AMERICAN WORKER,

104
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:15,565
A PUPPET FOR NO ONE.

105
00:03:20,304 --> 00:03:21,938
THEY GIVE A LOT OF MONEY TO

106
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,573
REPUBLICANS ON THE SENATE SIDE.

107
00:03:23,574 --> 00:03:25,475
HOW DO ARGUMENTS LIKE THAT HELP?

108
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:26,876
>> IT WAS DISAPPOINTING TO SEE

109
00:03:26,877 --> 00:03:28,745
YESTERDAY THEY AREN'T GOING TO

110
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:30,880
SUPPORT KEVIN KRAMER IN THIS

111
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:35,318
ALL TOO IMPORTANT NORTH DAKOTA

112
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:35,785
SENATE RACE.

113
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:37,721
HEIDI HEITKAMP HAS NOT BEEN A

114
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:45,662
THIS ECONOMY AND KRAMER HAS.

115
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:47,297
THEY'RE IDEOLOGUES NOT JUST

116
00:03:47,298 --> 00:03:47,964
SUPPORTING REPUBLICANS.

117
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:48,932
THEY'RE ALSO SUPPORTING

118
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:49,299
DEMOCRATS.

119
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,100
THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT HAS

120
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:52,702
BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE OF THE RNC.

121
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:54,571
THE PARTY IS WHERE THE DATA IS

122
00:03:54,572 --> 00:03:56,206
AND WHERE WE'RE BUILDING OUR

123
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:56,673
INFRASTRUCTURE.

124
00:03:56,674 --> 00:04:02,612
WE DO THE GROUND GAME.

125
00:04:02,613 --> 00:00:00,000
WE CONTINUE -- WE'RE SUPPORTING
