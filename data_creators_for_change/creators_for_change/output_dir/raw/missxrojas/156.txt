00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,829
hey everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to watch all the</font>

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:03,090
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture films</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recent</font>

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">Academy Awards before they took place</font>

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,629
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I watched about two-thirds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

5
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,309
including the theory of everything and

6
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:09,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Phil made me think a lot about</font>

7
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,120
disability and agency and consciousness

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,830
but also the intersection<font color="#CCCCCC"> between women</font>

9
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,690
and carers especially when women are

10
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,940
carers carers and mothers and students

11
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,350
and partners it's almost like women and

12
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,020
multifaceted outrageous I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge fan</font>

13
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,090
of Eddie redmayne's and I loved his

14
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,650
performance in that film but I did feel

15
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,630
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Felicity Jones didn't get enough</font>

16
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,070
attention even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone was</font>

17
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,990
adapted from a memoir by Jane Hawking

18
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,090
this one in fact the conversation around

19
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the film seemed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Center on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> her famous</font>

20
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,390
husband and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts to feel from</font>

21
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,500
reading these reviews and those

22
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,270
conversations as though Jane walking

23
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,160
were just a passenger on this journey to

24
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,110
infinity rather than a partner more

25
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,520
recently I was invited to a special

26
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,469
screening of the film and Jane Hawking

27
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,090
herself was in attendance and she did a

28
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,920
Q&A after the screening although I don't

29
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">think America the film can be found in</font>

30
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,550
its fidelity to the quote<font color="#E5E5E5"> unquote true</font>

31
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,469
story because without getting on a star

32
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,710
and philosophy on you what is truth yeah

33
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,359
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that one over but I was actually</font>

34
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,699
surprised as to how much Jane's speech

35
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,739
and her way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrying herself was so</font>

36
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,540
much like Felicity Jones in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the film</font>

37
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,430
Jane<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Felicity's Jane are very</font>

38
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,310
precise quietly powerful and determined

39
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,409
at the Q&A Jane<font color="#CCCCCC"> Holcomb spoke about the</font>

40
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,030
lack of support for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those with motor</font>

41
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,009
neurone disease and their carers not

42
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,750
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> because at any one time there was</font>

43
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,490
so few sufferers around with motor

44
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,900
neurone disease so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult</font>

45
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,850
to create that support system when it's

46
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,530
most needed when I don't she told that

47
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,700
really stuck out for me was the fact

48
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,110
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> she was saying that in the 60s it</font>

49
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,700
was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very rare to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see disabled</font>

50
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,049
people out and about like<font color="#E5E5E5"> people just</font>

51
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,729
didn't think that happened she wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

52
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,680
the city surveyor to ask the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kerbs be</font>

53
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,270
lowered so her husband could get around

54
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,950
in his<font color="#E5E5E5"> wheelchair and the city severe</font>

55
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,479
responded saying that that was not

56
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasonable and that he'd never heard of</font>

57
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,619
a disabled person wanting to do their

58
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:44,970
own shopping I've grown up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a city</font>

59
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,619
where much of the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport many</font>

60
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,360
of the shops many of the schools aren't

61
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,369
accessible to disabled people so I don't

62
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,470
know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> far we've come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from that but</font>

63
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,030
the work of people like Jane Hawking who

64
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,920
campaign and write letters and so on is

65
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,680
so valuable and so important and that

66
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">really comes through for me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and felicity</font>

67
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,950
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jane especially in the conversations</font>

68
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">between Jane and Stephen Hawking's</font>

69
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,979
parents there's a great moment where she

70
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,299
sits down<font color="#E5E5E5"> with Stephen Hawking's father</font>

71
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,449
and she<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quickly turns the tables</font>

72
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,068
you know he's expecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

73
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:11,980
three naive

74
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,260
polite girl who says funny things about

75
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Arts every now and then but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she</font>

76
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:17,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">really throws down his expectations of</font>

77
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:19,299
her and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that tension there</font>

78
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:21,040
works fantastically the last big point

79
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,720
in what to talk about was married women

80
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,730
Jane<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Steve are no longer married and</font>

81
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,230
the Ark of the theory of everything does

82
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,330
not end in married forever there's a

83
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,230
point in the story where the marriage

84
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">gets really crowded but what I love</font>

85
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,170
about that is that even though their

86
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,849
feelings are in flux Jane rejects

87
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:35,590
outright the judgment of others on her

88
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,180
situation there are some shins their

89
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,739
opinions and they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide the</font>

90
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:40,750
input and feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're giving the</font>

91
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,940
solution on this unique situation that

92
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,650
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jane</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

93
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,629
wonderfully stubborn steadfast heroic

94
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:48,519
and practical her<font color="#E5E5E5"> status as a carer</font>

95
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:50,590
doesn't remove anything from her her

96
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,480
personhood nor does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it make her second</font>

97
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,459
jury and that is what I most loved and

98
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:56,410
most missed in the media coverage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

99
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,670
film I love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear your thoughts in</font>

00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,230
comments i've also been given three
