Washington, D.C.
The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments over
the constitutionality of same-sex marriage.
Several gay couples and widows are challenging
marriage bans in four states.
The case will decide whether same-sex couples
have the right to marry under the 14th Amendment.
The court appears to be deeply divided, with
Justice Kennedy holding the deciding vote.
Theyâ€™re arguing whether the ruling in favor
of the couples could change the institution
of marriage.
The court will issue its decision at the end
of the term in June.
