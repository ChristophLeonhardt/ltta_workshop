those who govern in Argentina are desperate to provide some good news and that's why the mayor of Buenos Aires or a CEO rod real Arita was proud to show off these new homes for the poor built inside of austerity program impacting every level of government in the country none of the projects that are underway will be touched by this crisis we are committed to continue with our transformation of the city and this crisis won't affect it Argentina is struggling with a financial crisis that has steered memories of 2001 when the country defaulted on its sovereign debt it pushed millions of people into poverty the government wants to make sure investors know the administration of Mauricio Macri will be able to pay its financial obligations that's why the government and the IMF announced a plan to boost its 36 month financing package remains protecting the most vulnerable people in Argentina during this economic transition in this context I am pleased to see a firm commitment to the expansion of social protections under the authorities strenghtened policy plan the announcement came after a nationwide strike by Argentina's most powerful labor unions thousands took to the streets to protest the austerity measures announced by the government many Argentinians blame the IMF for forcing policies in the country which in the end hurt the working class there's a mixture of self-inflicted mistakes and and things which were heritage but again as I said I think that the objective the car right now is to start with a fresh clean sheet and trying to top the cheapest debt it could tap which is against the IMF and trying to get rid of the monetary debt and try to relaunch a bit its economic program with the objective of reaching 2019 election in a good position Argentinians are familiar with what an economic crisis looks like and even though the government is doing its best to prevent a situation from getting worse many are wondering whether it will be enough to prevent the past from repeating itself terasawa al-jazeera Buenos Aires
