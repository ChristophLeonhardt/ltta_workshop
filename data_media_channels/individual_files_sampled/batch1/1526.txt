the politics of prejudice are creating a summer of discontent in the UK the Labour Party dogged by accusations of anti-semitism and Islamophobia casting a shadow over the governing Conservative Party triggered by the ex foreign secretary Boris Johnson's article in which he outlined his position against a ban on face veils whilst describing women who wear them as looking like letter boxes and bank robbers that prompted an inquiry into mr. Johnson's behavior and criticism from the prime minister the question of how a woman should dress is a matter for a woman's individual choice nobody should be trying to tell a woman how to dress in these tense times where the UK is sharply divided over issues of brexit immigration and a higher presence of extreme right-wing politics some were worried that the current debate is leading to a rise in hate crime especially given mr. Johnson's recent article it was quite comfortable but instead he went on to fly dog women in very abusive terms the language which will have the effect it already has the effect of causing Muslim women to be abused in the street in some cases physically assaulted supporters of the former Foreign Secretary have said that he was merely exercising his right to freedom of speech but there are codes of conduct that govern the behavior of public officials and British Muslims feel that these remarks are really contributing to the normalization of Islamophobia in British politics slowly but surely there's an increase in Islamophobia and I think Muslim women being kind of the visible face of Islam because obviously we are covered people can see where Muslims we tend to be the ones that get the most hate and the most jokes made about us the hard right of the government have looked to Boris Johnson as a possible successor to tourism a were there to be a leadership challenge later in the year his comments may have emboldened their views but any short-term success would come at the cost of alienating a whole section of Britons who grow more uneasy at the direction the country's politics is headed Sonya Gallo al Jazeera London
