Raziel hello I'm Richard is bird and you're at the listening post here are some of the stories were covering this week round one of Brazil's presidential election the outsider who's bypassing the mainstream media in favor of the social side and some of the stick that he's getting there when the trolling turns ugly and dangerous shocking stories from female reporters about the abuse and threats they get online a Saudi Arabian journalist living in exile visits the Saudi consulate in Istanbul he doesn't come out and Donald Trump accuses the Chinese of election meddling in of all places des Moines Iowa here at The Listening Post when we've examined the media story in Brazil we focused on the conglomerates like Globo TV hack or DV SBT and the power that they wield this time as the country prepares to vote in the first round of presidential elections on Sunday October 7th we're looking at social media that's because Brazil is Facebook's third largest market more than half of the population there is on whatsapp that's where Brazil's far-right presidential candidate Jaya bol senado has taken his political campaign bolson ro has been described by some as Donald Trump meets Filipino president Rodrigo Duterte and like them he's turned the mainstream media into his useful enemies bolson ro has a ten-point lead in the polls in a country whose traditional parties have been stained by scandal a populist outsider has moved into the political vacuum our starting point this week is one of the primary battlegrounds in this election the social media space in Brazil je boson are on one of the primary information tools affecting this election is mobile social media allows him to work without filters in Brazil they don't trust politicians but also they don't trust the mainstream media they don't think that what appears in the media is truth so the fiber personnel is relying so much on social media as part of this appeal not a no actor he's not a front-runner by chance he's a candidate who's very strong on whatsapp on social media people get a lots of feeds lots of videos from votes on a door and it's no accident that he's leading the polls rajaiah bolson otto spent years in the National Assembly as a fringe politician before becoming the leader of a relatively small party which he's taken to the right he's ex-military makes no secret of his admiration for the hunter that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 85 and he's running on a law-and-order ticket he goes into the first round of this election as the front run consistently polling at over 30% despite being the victim of a stabbing last month from which he says he's still recovering his critics call him homophobic misogynistic that's what happens when you equate homosexuality with pedophilia or you go on camera and call a female political opponent unworthy of being raped then there was the time he called for the sterilization of the poor in a country where more than 50 million live in poverty bosun arrows supporters are they don't find any of those things disqualified or they don't believe them when they're reported on mainstream news outlets because millions of them are getting their news straight from the candidate on whatsapp or from his supporters like Douglas Garcia the founder of the data Sal Paulo a movement pushing balsan arrows agenda on social media Kohaku's kelly Publica anything he publishes on social media gets amplified he was not the one to build the Internet as a medium to propagate his political campaign but it was the conservatives who found in the internet a medium to exchange information without putting their personal security in danger to disseminate the ideas that were so not of managed to integrate into his campaign as it will not be censored on social media unlike what happens on the mainstream media where he has no voice what is happening in Brazil is that social media is facilitating c√°rdenas that are portraying himself as outside the establishment and no matter how we can question that they can easily reach their supporters and they can counteract what is happening even though there is some information available there the members of these groups prefer to believe what their own candidates or what the people supporting their candidates are saying everything that goes against what they believe is it's a mention as fake news brazilians aren't just on social media they are to an unusual degree involved the Facebook numbers there are through the roof and when polled recently on whether they have used social media as a source of news over the previous week two out of three said yes that's more than twice as high as Germany almost 50% higher than the US about 120 million Brazilians more than one in two are on whatsapp news spreads quickly on whatsapp groups and since it's coming from friends family or the candidates themselves it's up close feels personal and it's 24/7 TV is still important to Brazilians but the flow of information about the election is much greater on what sound TV is still watched in places where the Internet is not so popular among the poorest segments of the population but the internet social networks and especially whatsapp have made all the difference a lot of it is misinformation a lot of lies ends up circulating people believe them because they're often from people close to them say family members who circulate these messages these videos that's how it ends up becoming credible but it's a lie and both tornadoes political strategy is to spread fake news to spread lies pinning the fake news charge on Bowl senado personally is difficult but there's no doubt that some of his supporters have been producing plenty of that kind of material in July Facebook shut down almost 300 pages and accounts run by a conservative political group known as M BL for as Facebook put it hiding behind fake accounts misleading Brazilians about the origin of the content and spreading misinformation fact checkers have been working overtime in this election but they are struggling to keep up and have an impact many of them are scouring pro-bowl senado social media platforms for fake news and some of those platforms offer media watch services of their own focusing on the output of mainstream news outlets horrible so not among the edges the chipping away at their credibility and in doing so defending the interests of their chosen candidate and his team attacked the traditional media a lot and they use social media to say he's a victim of attacks from the left who call him a fascist racist homophobe they use it to say his critics exaggerate they use it to the nice statements he's made and they also use it to spread fake news these lies have a devastating effect a lot of people believe this misinformation up until four or five years ago there was more or less a belief that social media was a tool that was benefiting mostly left-wing groups against oppression I think now we have seen not only in the case of Brazil but also in brexit in the United States how right-wing groups particularly those in the fringe have successfully employed social media to spread their ideas to form community and also to question what they call is the establishment when Brazilians talk about the media establishment they're talking about global it's the biggest media company in Latin America hugely influential and the bane of the Brazilian left because it's conservative and has traditionally played the role of political kingmaker right-wing candidates have always courted global gyre bolson Otto didn't bother knowing he was too far right for the network's taste and betting he didn't need its endorsement he hasn't taken part in any televised debates since last month stabbing ball senado says he can't doctor's orders not everyone believes that the final debate of round one took place this past Thursday three days before voting day again bowl senado was a no-show the boccie he preferred not to appear on the debate aired on Globo the most important one because he knows that he could make mistakes and expose himself to attack from his opponents especially given his controversial proposals okay I am the CIA prepare to attempt a coup so for you know just say a septum in theory the stuffing helped because he had a good reason not to participate in the debates look I'm on medical treatment but he tended to avoid them even before the attack so while his opponents were debating each other on Globo and he did an interview on a rival Network which then revealed it was back before calling it a night though he spent a little time on Facebook live talking to his supporters on the device that has driven his campaign changed Brazilian politics and the way it is covered his phone we're discussing other media stories that are on our radar with one of our producers Tariq Nava Tariq this past week a prominent Saudi journalist a dissident disappeared in Istanbul give us the details behind the case so that journalist is Jamel keshavjee a former newspaper editor and commentator who fled Saudi Arabia last year over fears for his safety he'd been banned from writing and tweeting by the Saudi authorities and went into self-exile in the US here's what we know about his disappearance this past Tuesday he visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to take care of what should have been some routine paperwork his fiance was waiting for him outside but several hours later he'd yet to re-emerge so she raved the alarm and called the police now since then the consulate has issued a statement to the Saudi state news agency saying keshavjee left the building and that they are following up on media reports of his disappearance Turkish government officials say they think he's done inside now give us an idea of what kind of things he'd been writing about and where so much of keshavjee x' work over the past year has been in english who was a frequent contributor to The Washington Post and a critic of Saudis powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince has sold himself as a reformer who's modernizing the kingdom in reality he's overseen a repressive campaign to silence critics and potential challengers intellectuals journalists women's rights activists even princes in the royal family have been rounded up and imprisoned and in his pieces keshavjee spoke out against what was happening in the country but his criticism was always measured and following his disappearance the Washington Post published a blank column in support of its contributor it bore her shock G's byline and the headline a missing voice under Washington now where this past week President Donald Trump accuses China of meddling in the upcoming US midterm elections then he goes on Twitter and he points out what he calls propaganda ads in a newspaper somewhere in Iowa what's the story so it's not often that a local paper like the Des Moines Register becomes the focus of an international trade war but that's what happened when it published a full-page supplement produced by another paper the state-run China Daily that featured stories on the mutual benefits of us-china trade if Trump has a point here if that this isn't journalism it's advertising designed to look like journalism it can be difficult for readers to distinguish between the two but the papers executive editor Carol hunter said the China Daily insert was clearly marked and that quote Iowans are smart enough to see this for what it is it's an advertiser buying access to an audience so describing this as election meddling is not just a bit of a stretch on the president's part it's also slightly hypocritical isn't that it says because while it's true that government-run outlets like China daily or international broadcaster 3 GTN work to promote Beijing's view to the rest of the world the US government operates a few of its own news outlets that do the same thing the US has invested billions of dollars over the years and outlets like Radio Free Asia and Voice of America which explicitly work to promote so-called American values and they're not flipping inserts into local papers they're on the air okay thanks tarick we're turning now to dispatches from what they call the virtual war zone a story about the perils of online journalism reporters have always had to defend their work but the trolling of journalists has grown commonplace and many female media professionals are dealing with the kind of hate messages that men will never see comments about their gender appearance sexuality the language can be ugly and violent threats of sexual assaults and rape have grown disturbingly common because for trolls hiding behind an online profile is not difficult and the anonymity of social media has made the dissemination of abuse and hate as easy as a simple click the listening post spoke with two journalists Maria Reza in the Philippines and Sagarika Ghosh in India about their experience with online harassment and the impact it has had on their work and their well-being also talking us through this story Hannah Storm the director of an organization that trains reporters on how to stay safe both on and off the web I used to be a war zone correspondent but in a war zone you know where the enemy is you know what you need to prepare for you know how to stay safe in this new landscape this is intimate you take it home with you you wake up with it it's with you all the time I've been attacked as a communist operative a CIA every kind of word that you can think of for ugly for animals for I don't know I mean you name it I've it's been thrown at me as a journalist I'm used to defending the work I do but how do you respond when someone threatens you with rape when someone wants you dead you're inundated with a barrage of hate of vitriol words calling you things like prostitute ooh a whore or hooker with somebody else's sex slave that they're going to do things to you that are really sexually explicit women journalists had three times more likely to experience online harassment than their male colleagues people are trying to shame them into silence by calling their names by undermining the reputation and by trying to violate their role as journalists in August of rapper came out with a series of stories I called it the propaganda machine that series showed you that social media has been weaponized that accounts that are that are in the middle of this the content creators are working for government and it was all connected to anyone who questioned the drug war as soon as the series was published I started receiving an average of 98 messages per hour I'll read one to you is that all right so this one this one this is from a real real kid maybe Maria Reza's dream become the ultimate porn star in a gangbang scene so it's not but it's their second one is um make sure Maria Russell gets publicly raped to death when martial law expands to do zone it would bring joy in my heart it's meant to tear you down so that you don't have the confidence to continue reporting that's one and then the second is to make you doubt yourself to stop you from reporting stories that go against the government narrative all of that is just a day-to-day rubbish and horror that females journalists have to experience but it's not just virtual it's very much physical it's very much psychological as well a lot of the journalists who are killed around the world get threats online so certainly the physical and the virtual do collide one of the issues with the news organisations is trying to understand the severity of the threat and that's often a difficult issue when you've got an online harassment or got online threats to figure out how serious do you need to take it in the beginning I never used to take it seriously because I thought it was just you know people barking on social media I lunatics on social media or crazy people who I didn't have to take seriously but then I started getting some very serious threats one of the first threats that I got was a threat of gang rape and it was gang rape of me as well as my daughter who was then in school and they said we know where your daughter studies we know what school she's in we know what time she comes out of school and we're going to grab her and we are going to assault her and we are going to perform gang rape you see what happens is that the person puts out a threat and then deletes the account but having deleted the account lots of other handles then take it up and disseminate it so its purpose is served because it creates a kind of chilling effect you get very scared you tend to sort of self censor because you're scare and what is out there the IWM F a troll Busters report that came out recently said that something like 30 percent or female journalist they spoke with had considered leaving the profession because of the impact it has had on them something like 40% of female journalists have actually stopped writing about certain stories if we're in a situation where journalists are impacted on to this extent that's really really damaging to freedom of expression as well and then the threads kept on growing and they kept getting more and more abusive and more and more foul if you're a liberal you're under attack if you're a journalist you're under attack if you're a liberal woman journalist you're public enemy number one there are women who are attacked on social media who are then attacked off social media the threats can be online and then go offline my colleague and good friend Gauri Lankesh was actually shot in September 2017 and a Facebook user put out a hit list of me and four other women saying that when one has been taken care of we now need to locate these five other women find out where they live and we need to systematically finish them off and this was then shared by numerous other Facebook users now the reason why I take these Facebook and Twitter threats seriously is because you know this is exactly what happened to memcache she faced social media threats and she never used to take it seriously but the fact is she was killed you know and the scary thing about Gauri's death this is the murder suspect has said that oh I didn't know who she was I was just told that she was damaging my religion and so I can look so that's the level of brainwashing and fanaticism that exists out there I don't think the government is doing anything about it actually I think a number of these trolls who are there on social media are actually followed by government ministers I think social media companies need to do much more I would love it if people were engaging with me on my journalism all were engaging with me on my work but if it becomes a place for death threats and for rape threats and for gang rape threats then I think it loses its meaning social media companies need to have much stricter restrictions on what is hate speech what is hate speech against women what is hate speech against minorities the problem that I've seen is that they are in Silicon Valley looking at the world through lenses that don't take into account the global landscape they operate in when I hear Mark Zuckerberg say you know it'll take us five years I I just say you know we don't have five years in our countries where people are getting killed every day in the Philippines where I have seven cases and could go to jail information is the core of our beliefs of our common reality and we need to get back to a point where this kind of dystopian use of information is mitigated back to Brazil now and the polarizing figure that is Shia Bowl senado tens of thousands of demonstrators most of them women marched on the streets of twenty-seven Brazilian cities last weekend to protest against a candidate who occasionally makes Donald Trump look enlightened the protests grew out of a Facebook group that spread across the web called women united against bull senado which is four million strong the hashtag la now the English equivalent not him bull Senado actually built his political base online however social media is a sword that cuts both ways and being depicted online as the evil Lord Voldemort from Harry Potter probably wasn't what he had in mind we'll leave you now with a collection of tweets and memes from the not hem campaign that have been doing the rounds and we'll see you next time here at The Listening Post you
