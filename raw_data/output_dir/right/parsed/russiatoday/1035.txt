sure find them imports from Israel but I
mean look around the rest of the world
you know we've no problem taking the
imports from America Saudi Arabia and I
don't agree with Israeli settlements I
don't think that any government any
nation should really be supporting that
I think yeah that sounds like a good
message I feel bad for Gaza and
everything else poor farmer Stoney's
guess food salad
same as the rest of world well you
should stand for what you think is the
correct thing that I haven't being a
country that was kind of subjected to
store for a long time as well you know
we have a an opinion on those sort of
things now we should finally impart some
Israel and oyster part Gaza
