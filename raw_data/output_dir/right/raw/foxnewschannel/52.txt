1
00:00:00,604 --> 00:00:05,341
IT'S EMILY COMPAGNO.

2
00:00:05,342 --> 00:00:07,009
PRESIDENT TRUMP VOWING TO SEND

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,378
AS MANY TROOPS "AS NECESSARY" TO

4
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:10,713
STOP A CARAVAN OF THOUSANDS

5
00:00:10,714 --> 00:00:11,347
MARCHING TOWARDS THE

6
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:13,149
UNITED STATES IF THEY REACH THE

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,218
SOUTHERN BORDER.

8
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:15,885
THE PRESIDENT ALSO BLASTING

9
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:16,953
DEMOCRATS FOR THE PROBLEM.

10
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:18,854
>> President Trump: YOU KNOW

11
00:00:18,855 --> 00:00:20,957
HOW THE CARAVAN STARTED?

12
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:21,958
I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAD

13
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:23,226
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT, AND NOW

14
00:00:23,227 --> 00:00:25,461
THEY ARE SAYING I THINK WE MADE

15
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:26,162
A BIG MISTAKE.

16
00:00:26,163 --> 00:00:28,397
THAT'S AN ASSAULT ON OUR

17
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:28,731
COUNTRY.

18
00:00:28,732 --> 00:00:31,801
THAT'S AN ASSAULT.

19
00:00:31,802 --> 00:00:34,136
AND IN THAT CARAVAN, YOU HAVE

20
00:00:34,137 --> 00:00:35,738
SOME VERY BAD PEOPLE.

21
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:38,007
YES A VERY BAD PEOPLE.

22
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:40,376
AND WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO

23
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:40,977
OUR COUNTRY.

24
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:42,478
>> Dana: TRUMP NOT BACKING

25
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,248
DOWN AFTER SAYING TERRORISTS IN

26
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:47,850
GANG MEMBERS MIGHT BE AMONG THE

27
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:49,785
MIGRANTS.

28
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:51,220
>> President Trump: I SPOKE TO

29
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:52,822
THEM LAST EVENING THE DAY

30
00:00:52,823 --> 00:00:53,155
BEFORE.

31
00:00:53,156 --> 00:00:55,458
I SPEAK TO THEM ALL THE TIME AND

32
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:57,360
THEY SAY, AND YOU KNOW THIS AS

33
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:59,562
WELL AS ANYBODY, OVER THE COURSE

34
00:00:59,563 --> 00:01:00,796
OF THE YEAR, OVER THE COURSE OF

35
00:01:00,797 --> 00:01:03,065
A NUMBER OF YEARS, THEY HAVE

36
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:08,671
INTERCEPTED MANY PEOPLE FROM THE

37
00:01:08,672 --> 00:01:09,071
MIDDLE EAST.

38
00:01:09,072 --> 00:01:10,773
THEY HAVE INTERCEPTED ISIS.

39
00:01:10,774 --> 00:01:11,741
THEY HAVE INTERCEPTED ALL SORTS

40
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:14,844
OF PEOPLE.

41
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:16,912
THEY HAVE INTERCEPTED WONDERFUL

42
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:17,647
PEOPLE FROM THE MIDDLE EAST AND

43
00:01:17,648 --> 00:01:21,050
THEY HAVE INTERCEPTED BAD ONES.

44
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:23,185
THEY HAVE --

45
00:01:23,186 --> 00:01:24,020
>> Dana: PRESIDENT TRUMP

46
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:24,754
CONTINUING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS

47
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:26,155
FROM THE MEDIA.

48
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:29,592
I WANTED TO PLAY ONE MORE

49
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:30,559
SOUND BITE, SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT

50
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,761
GONNA BELIEVE ABOUT WHAT WAS

51
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:34,130
SAID ABOUT OUR MILITARY.

52
00:01:34,131 --> 00:01:34,530
WATCH THIS.

53
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:36,799
>> IF YOU PUT MILITARY DOWN

54
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,568
THERE, WE KNOW WHAT THE GOD

55
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:41,137
FORBID IS IN THIS SITUATION.

56
00:01:41,138 --> 00:01:42,405
HOW DOES THAT PLAY?

57
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:44,140
I WAS IT GOOD FOR ANYBODY?

58
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:45,608
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TURN AWAY

59
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:47,176
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF

60
00:01:47,177 --> 00:01:48,644
PEOPLE EVEN IF PEOPLE START

61
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:49,612
GETTING SHOT.

62
00:01:49,613 --> 00:01:51,814
WHAT MESSAGE DOES THAT SEND?

63
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:52,181
WHO WINS?

64
00:01:52,182 --> 00:01:53,015
>> Dana: DID SURPRISE ME A

65
00:01:53,016 --> 00:01:54,984
LITTLE BIT HE WOULD SAY THAT

66
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:55,951
BECAUSE OUR MILITARY IS NOT

67
00:01:55,952 --> 00:01:58,387
KNOWN FOR GOING AFTER INNOCENT

68
00:01:58,388 --> 00:01:58,721
PEOPLE.

69
00:01:58,722 --> 00:02:00,289
THEY ARE THERE TO TRY TO PROTECT

70
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,157
THE BORDER.

71
00:02:01,158 --> 00:02:03,559
ANYWAY, GREG, WILL START WITH

72
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:03,859
YOU.

73
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,162
>> Greg: NOT VERY BRIGHT, THAT

74
00:02:06,163 --> 00:02:08,564
CUOMO FOLLOW.

75
00:02:08,565 --> 00:02:10,399
WASN'T A NICE THING TO SAY.

76
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,101
I WONDER ABOUT THE MEDIA BECAUSE

77
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:14,804
THEY TEND NOT TO ASK THE VERY

78
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:16,572
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS LIKE HOW DID

79
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:18,174
THE CARAVAN START?

80
00:02:18,175 --> 00:02:19,408
WHO CALLED IT A CARAVAN?

81
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:22,178
HOW IS IT BEING MANAGED, WHERE

82
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:23,379
THE PEOPLE MANAGING IT?

83
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,281
THEY SAY THAT THE CARAVAN IS

84
00:02:25,282 --> 00:02:27,983
BLOOMING LIKE IT IS SOME KIND OF

85
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:30,052
NATURAL EVENT OR THAT IS

86
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:30,486
SPONTANEOUS.

87
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:35,157
IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE ORGANIZED.

88
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:36,625
IT'S ORGANIZED BY MEXICAN

89
00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:37,360
ADVOCACY GROUPS, AND THEN WHEN

90
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:39,662
YOU GET TO THE SIZABLE GROUP OF

91
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:40,996
PEOPLE IN WHICH YOU CAN'T TELL

92
00:02:40,997 --> 00:02:42,598
WHO'S IN THE GROUP AND WHO ISN'T

93
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,000
WHICH IS WHY YOU NEED A PROCESS,

94
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:46,202
BECAUSE THERE COULD BE

95
00:02:46,203 --> 00:02:47,036
TERRORISTS AND OBVIOUSLY THERE

96
00:02:47,037 --> 00:02:48,804
COULD NOT BE TERRORISTS.

97
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:50,439
WHO'S GOING TO KNOW?

98
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,741
THE MEDIA TAKES THE NARRATIVE

99
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:54,377
AND THEY TWISTED, SO AFTER

100
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:55,945
HELPING THE ONSLAUGHT MULTIPLY,

101
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:58,981
THE ACCUSED TRUMP OF SEIZING IT

102
00:02:58,982 --> 00:03:01,183
AS AN ISSUE WHEN BEFOREHAND, IT

103
00:03:01,184 --> 00:03:03,419
WAS THE MEDIA AND THE ADVOCACY

104
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,588
GROUPS WHO HAD SEIZED ON THIS

105
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:07,556
SPECTACLE TO BEGIN WITH TO

106
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:08,758
CREATE AN UGLY POLITICAL ISSUE.

107
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,459
AND THEN THEY GO BUT LOOK WHAT

108
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,761
TRUMP IS DOING.

109
00:03:11,762 --> 00:03:12,595
THEY ARE A BUNCH OF HYPOCRITES.

110
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:17,166
YOU KNOW IT IS SADDER?

111
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:17,767
AVENATTI IS TELLING THE

112
00:03:17,768 --> 00:03:19,268
DEMOCRATS TO GROW A SPINE.

113
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:20,169
WHEN MICHAEL AVENATTI BECOMES

114
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,937
THE VOICE OF REASON FOR YOUR

115
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:23,572
PARTY, YOU ARE IN TROUBLE?

116
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:24,440
>> Dana: TALK ABOUT IN TERMS

117
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:28,811
OF THE MEDIA COVERAGE, SAYING

118
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:31,013
THAT THE MEDIA SHOULD NOT TAKE

119
00:03:31,014 --> 00:03:31,747
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WORDS AND USE

120
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:33,182
THEM SO THAT THE ONSLAUGHT WAS

121
00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:33,582
TOO STRONG.

122
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,485
THEY THINK MAYBE THERE WAS

123
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:37,987
SOFTER LANGUAGE.

124
00:03:37,988 --> 00:03:40,489
THEY ARE DOING HIS BIDDING.

125
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,957
>> Jesse: IT'S LIKE THE MOB

126
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:42,358
CONTROVERSY.

127
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:43,959
DON'T CALL IT A CARAVAN.

128
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,195
IT'S A PARADE, PROBABLY WHAT

129
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:47,396
THEY WOULD SAY.

130
00:03:47,397 --> 00:03:48,397
THEY HAVE REPORTED BREATHLESSLY

131
00:03:48,398 --> 00:03:50,266
ABOUT HOW MANY SCOOPS OF

132
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:52,001
ICE CREAM THIS PRESIDENT HAS,

133
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:53,502
AND THEY ARE NOT EVEN CURIOUS

134
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:55,404
ABOUT HOW THIS CARAVAN ARE

135
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:56,038
HAPPENING.

136
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,840
I THINK THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO'VE

137
00:03:57,841 --> 00:04:00,342
SENT REPORTERS DOWN TO EMBEDDED

138
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:02,378
IN THE CARAVAN, FOX NEWS.

139
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,413
SARA CARTER DOWN THERE.

140
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:05,014
AND WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE.

141
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:06,015
"THE WASHINGTON POST" HAS

142
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,149
SOMEONE DOWN THERE, AND JUDICIAL

143
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,851
WATCH EVEN HAS SOMEONE DOWN

144
00:04:08,852 --> 00:04:09,218
THERE.

145
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:11,220
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF INTEREST IN

146
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:12,488
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, SO WHEN

147
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:13,856
TRUMP SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THE

148
00:04:13,857 --> 00:04:15,658
CARAVAN, THERE IS NO WAY FOR

149
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:17,426
THEM TO FACT-CHECK IT.

150
00:04:17,427 --> 00:04:19,061
THEY ARE GOING TO ASSUME THE

151
00:04:19,062 --> 00:04:19,795
PRESIDENT IS SAYING INCORRECT

152
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:20,463
THINGS, AND SOME OF THE

153
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:22,164
REPORTING COMING OUT OF THERE IS

154
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:23,466
VERY INTERESTING.

155
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:25,301
80% OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THE

156
00:04:25,302 --> 00:04:26,302
MIGRANT CARAVAN ARE MALES UNDER

157
00:04:26,303 --> 00:04:28,637
THE AGE OF 35, AND THEY ARE NOT

158
00:04:28,638 --> 00:04:31,340
FLEEING VIOLENCE.

159
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:33,309
THESE ARE ECONOMIC REFUGEES.

160
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:33,876
DO YOU KNOW THEY HOLD

161
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:34,443
"THE WASHINGTON POST"?

162
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:35,578
WHEN THEY GET THERE AND START

163
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:36,445
MAKING MONEY IN AMERICA, THEY

164
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:38,581
ARE GOING TO WIRE THE MONEY BACK

165
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:39,615
TO EL SALVADOR.

166
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:41,016
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE GANG

167
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:41,417
AFFILIATED.

168
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:43,986
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

169
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:45,120
PREVIOUSLY DEPORTED, AND THAT'S

170
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:45,955
BEEN CONFIRMED.

171
00:04:45,956 --> 00:04:47,022
IF THEY ARE REALLY THAT UPSET

172
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:49,625
ABOUT THE CONDITIONS IN THE

173
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:51,193
COUNTRY, INSTEAD OF MARCHING UP

174
00:04:51,194 --> 00:04:53,028
NORTH TO AMERICA, MARCH AGAINST

175
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:54,430
YOUR OWN CORRUPT GOVERNMENT.

176
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,031
THAT WOULD SOLVE A LOT OF

177
00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:57,233
PROBLEMS IN MY OPINION.

178
00:04:57,234 --> 00:04:59,134
>> Dana: HERE, JUAN, WE ARE

179
00:04:59,135 --> 00:05:01,437
TWO WEEKS AWAY FROM THE

180
00:05:01,438 --> 00:05:03,038
MIDTERMS, TWO WEEKS TODAY.

181
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,640
SOMEONE LIKE JOE DONNELLY OR

182
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:05,941
CLAIRE McCASKILL, TWO RED

183
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:07,243
STATE DEMOCRATS RUNNING FOR

184
00:05:07,244 --> 00:05:08,544
REELECTION, THEY KNOW THAT FOR

185
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:10,145
THE NEXT 13 DAYS, THE REPUBLICAN

186
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:11,914
CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO BE USING

187
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:14,283
THIS ISSUE AND IT'S NOT GOOD FOR

188
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:15,251
THEM IN THEIR CAMPAIGN.

189
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:17,720
>> Juan: NO, BECAUSE ANY TIME

190
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:18,787
USE FEARMONGERING, IT REALLY

191
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:21,323
PUSHES A BUTTON AND I THINK THE

192
00:05:21,324 --> 00:05:22,558
PRESIDENT AND THE REPUBLICANS

193
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,393
RIGHT NOW, ABSENT A MESSAGE FOR

194
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:25,694
THE MIDTERMS MAY HAVE DECIDED

195
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:27,763
THIS IS THE BUTTON TO PUSH.

196
00:05:27,764 --> 00:05:30,766
I READ TODAY STEPHEN KING, THE

197
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:34,570
HORROR BOOK WRITER SAID THE

198
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:36,405
REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN THEME HERE

199
00:05:36,406 --> 00:05:38,807
IS THE AFRAID.

200
00:05:38,808 --> 00:05:40,376
THEREFORE, EVEN TODAY THE

201
00:05:40,377 --> 00:05:41,610
PRESIDENT, WHO SUGGESTED GUESS

202
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:42,244
WHAT, THERE COULD BE

203
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:43,445
MIDDLE EASTERN TERRORISTS AMONG

204
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:44,380
THESE PEOPLE.

205
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:45,848
THEY ARE ALL GANG MEMBERS.

206
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:46,749
TODAY HE'S A WE DON'T HAVE PROOF

207
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,552
BUT THEY COULD BE.

208
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:50,085
THAT'S ALL HE DOES.

209
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:53,956
HE JUST PUSHES THE FEAR BUTTON

210
00:05:53,957 --> 00:05:55,624
WHEN HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING

211
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,326
ELSE TO SAY.

212
00:05:57,327 --> 00:05:59,995
TO ME, WHAT'S INCREDIBLE IS, MY

213
00:05:59,996 --> 00:06:01,997
REPUBLICAN FRIENDS BUY THIS

214
00:06:01,998 --> 00:06:03,165
STALE BREAD OF HATRED.

215
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,800
THE PRESIDENT EVEN GOES HARDER.

216
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:07,903
HE SAYS I AM A NATIONALIST.

217
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:09,772
THESE GLOBALISTS WANT TO COME IN

218
00:06:09,773 --> 00:06:11,774
HERE AND TAKE OVER.

219
00:06:11,775 --> 00:06:14,176
NATIONALIST, WHERE WE'VE HEARD

220
00:06:14,177 --> 00:06:14,810
THAT?

221
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:15,411
WHITE NATIONALIST.

222
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:17,580
STEVE BANNON, THAT WHOLE LINE.

223
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:19,548
SO HORRIBLE, SO INTENSELY

224
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:21,083
DIVISIVE.

225
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:22,651
OH, THESE BROWN HORDES.

226
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:23,352
>> Greg: DON'T YOU THINK IT'S

227
00:06:23,353 --> 00:06:26,288
DIVISIVE TO SAY YOUR REPUBLICANS

228
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:28,390
-- YOUR SONS ARE REPUBLICANS.

229
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:29,892
YOU'RE CALLING THEM RACIST.

230
00:06:29,893 --> 00:06:31,360
>> Juan: I'M CALLING THIS

231
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:32,428
ACTION BY THIS PRESIDENT, GIVEN

232
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:36,165
THE DIVISIVE NATURE.

233
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:36,865
>> Dana: SHOULD WE JUST DO

234
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:39,134
NOTHING?

235
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:44,873
>> Juan: HOW DID AMERICA REACT

236
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:45,240
BACK THEN?

237
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:50,579
IN TERMS OF COME YOU THINK ABOUT

238
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,580
THE JEWISH EXODUS, IRISH PEOPLE

239
00:06:51,581 --> 00:06:52,915
COMING TO THIS COUNTRY AS A

240
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,817
RESULT OF FAMINE.

241
00:06:54,818 --> 00:06:56,352
EVERY MOMENT, THERE WERE PEOPLE

242
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:58,821
IN THE FAR RIGHT TOO REACTIVE.

243
00:06:58,822 --> 00:07:00,322
STOP THOSE JEWS FROM COMING IN

244
00:07:00,323 --> 00:07:01,857
HERE.

245
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:03,759
WHY?

246
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,462
>> Dana: EMILY, DO YOU THINK

247
00:07:06,463 --> 00:07:07,196
IT'S COMPARABLE?

248
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:08,864
>> Emily: KNOW, AND I WANT TO

249
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:11,400
POINT OUT TWO THINGS.

250
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:12,134
NUMBER ONE, THIS HUMANITARIAN

251
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:15,104
CRISIS PREEXISTED THIS CARAVAN

252
00:07:15,105 --> 00:07:16,972
INTO ME THE MIXED MESSAGING AND

253
00:07:16,973 --> 00:07:17,706
HYPOCRISY'S POINT FROM THE LEFT

254
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:19,975
WHO ARE IGNORING THE FACT THAT

255
00:07:19,976 --> 00:07:21,810
16 JOURNALISTS WERE KILLED THIS

256
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:24,613
YEAR ALONE IN MEXICO, AND ALL OF

257
00:07:24,614 --> 00:07:26,815
THE ATTENTION IS ON KHASHOGGI.

258
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:29,385
OR THAT MIGRANTS FOUND DEAD IN

259
00:07:29,386 --> 00:07:31,820
TEXAS BECAUSE OF THE CHOKE HOLD

260
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:34,123
THE CARTELS HAVE ON NOT ONLY

261
00:07:34,124 --> 00:07:35,424
THOSE GOVERNMENTS SOUTH OF US

262
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:36,792
BUT ALSO THOSE PEOPLE, INCLUDING

263
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:40,396
THE FACT THAT AN ENTIRE POLICE

264
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:42,231
OFFICE WAS ARRESTED FOR

265
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:42,631
CORRUPTION.

266
00:07:42,632 --> 00:07:45,100
THE BORDER SECURITY IS A SMALL

267
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:46,602
PORTION OF THE ABSOLUTE CRISIS

268
00:07:46,603 --> 00:07:49,204
IS GOING ON, AND THE

269
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:50,706
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IS BECAUSE

270
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:52,808
OF THE POROUS BORDER AND LACK OF

271
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:54,143
LAWS THAT WE HAVE.

272
00:07:54,144 --> 00:07:56,612
SECONDLY, ABOUT THE MILITARY AND

273
00:07:56,613 --> 00:07:57,546
THE COMMENTS.

274
00:07:57,547 --> 00:07:59,615
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE

275
00:07:59,616 --> 00:08:00,816
NATIONAL GUARD COMES UNDER STATE

276
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:02,785
AUTHORITY WITH FEDERAL FUNDS.

277
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:04,520
THE PRESIDENT CAN FEDERALIZE

278
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:04,820
THEM.

279
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:05,821
ACTIVE-DUTY MILITARY, THE

280
00:08:05,822 --> 00:08:12,461
EXCEPTION TO THE POST, TOSS --

281
00:08:12,462 --> 00:08:16,198
SUPPORT, NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT

282
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:16,799
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

283
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,499
THE HYPERBOLE FROM THE LEFT,

284
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,968
SAYING THAT THEY ARE GOING TO

285
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:21,603
START SHOOTING PEOPLE IS

286
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:23,005
OFFENSIVE AND TOTALLY INCORRECT.

287
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:24,740
>> Juan: WE DISAGREE,

288
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:25,107
OBVIOUSLY.

289
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:30,212
I FEEL SO PASSIONATELY ABOUT IT.

290
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:31,980
THIS IS LOWBALL POLITICS.

291
00:08:31,981 --> 00:08:34,216
SOMETHING INSIDE, SO IMPORTANT.

292
00:08:34,217 --> 00:08:35,751
THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS PREDATES

293
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:36,050
THIS.

294
00:08:36,052 --> 00:08:37,086
PEOPLE SHOULD THINK OF IT IN

295
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:40,022
THOSE TERMS, BECAUSE I THINK THE

296
00:08:40,023 --> 00:08:42,091
CONSERVATIVES HISTORICALLY HAVE

297
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:43,425
BEEN EMPATHETIC, COMPASSIONATE

298
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:44,626
PEOPLE, NOT LIKE WITH THIS

299
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:45,394
PRESIDENT IS DOING.

300
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:46,995
>> Jesse: I HAVE TO ADDRESS

301
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:48,497
SOME OF THE THINGS YOU SAID.

302
00:08:48,498 --> 00:08:50,532
SARA CARTER, WANTED HER CALLING

303
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:51,633
SARAH FOX NEWS, WENT THERE.

304
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:53,035
YOU ARE NOT THERE.

305
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:54,603
SHE'S THERE.

306
00:08:54,604 --> 00:08:56,038
SHE'S A COLLEAGUE.

307
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,805
SPOKE TO GUATEMALAN INTELLIGENCE

308
00:08:56,806 --> 00:08:58,040
AND INTERVIEW PEOPLE IN THE

309
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,342
CARAVAN AND IS CONFIRMED THERE

310
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:02,177
IS MS-13 AFFILIATED GANG MEMBERS

311
00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:03,345
AMONG THEM CARAVAN.

312
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:05,481
IF YOU ARE GOING TO SIT THERE

313
00:09:05,482 --> 00:09:07,549
AND CALL YOUR COLLEAGUE A LIAR

314
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,118
WHILE YOU ARE SITTING IN THIS

315
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,819
NICE AIR-CONDITIONED STUDIO IN

316
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,620
MANHATTAN, I THINK IT'S

317
00:09:11,621 --> 00:09:12,221
UNBECOMING.

318
00:09:12,222 --> 00:09:14,990
SECOND OF ALL, YOU HAVE NOT

319
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:15,324
SAID --

320
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:17,993
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO BUT THE

321
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:18,594
CARAVAN, JUAN?

322
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:19,962
YOU HAVE NO PLAN TO DO ANYTHING

323
00:09:19,963 --> 00:09:22,798
ABOUT IT.

324
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,366
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO OUT OF

325
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:27,770
SUBSTANCE TO WHAT TO DO WITH

326
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:28,437
THIS 7,000 STRONG MIGRATION

327
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:29,004
COMING NORTH?

328
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,906
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

329
00:09:30,907 --> 00:09:32,808
>> Juan: I THINK IT'S VERY

330
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:34,710
CLEAR, GIVEN REPUBLICANS CONTROL

331
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:35,210
THE WHITE HOUSE --

332
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:36,678
>> Jesse: WHAT ARE YOU GOING

333
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:39,047
TO DO WITH THE BORDER?

334
00:09:39,048 --> 00:09:40,382
>> Juan: WHY DON'T THEY THINK

335
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:41,850
THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT IS

336
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:43,619
SO BADLY BROKEN.

337
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,387
>> Jesse: FIX THE IMMIGRATION

338
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:46,321
SYSTEM?

339
00:09:46,322 --> 00:09:48,390
IT'S BECAUSE OF DEMOCRATIC

340
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:49,224
POLITICS.

341
00:09:49,225 --> 00:09:53,195
THE FEINSTEIN MEMO.

342
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:54,797
THIS IS WHAT ATTRACTS THESE

343
00:09:54,798 --> 00:09:55,430
PEOPLE.

344
00:09:55,431 --> 00:09:56,165
>> Juan: THIS IS LOWBALL

345
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,467
POLITICS AND YOU ARE ON MESSAGE

346
00:09:58,468 --> 00:10:00,669
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.

347
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,005
TODAY HE SAID HE HAS NO PROOF.

348
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:04,640
>> Jesse: YOU WANT TO PROTECT

349
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:06,108
ELECTION INTEGRITY BUT YOU DON'T

350
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:07,643
WANT TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF

351
00:10:07,644 --> 00:10:08,577
THE BORDER.

352
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:10,212
IF THESE WERE RUSSIANS COMING

353
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:11,880
ACROSS, YOU WILL PROBABLY BUILD

354
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:12,247
THE WALL.

355
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:13,682
>> Juan: PEOPLE COMING WITH

356
00:10:13,683 --> 00:10:15,617
GUNS, HORDES, THEY'RE GOING TO

357
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:17,252
TAKE OVER AMERICA?

358
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:18,821
>> Jesse: NO ONE IS TAKING

359
00:10:18,822 --> 00:10:19,254
OVER ANYTHING.

360
00:10:19,255 --> 00:10:23,926
>> Greg: ACCORDING TO JUAN'S

361
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:24,693
MESSAGE, MEXICO IS RACIST TOO.

362
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:27,963
THEY ARE TRYING TO STOP

363
00:10:27,964 --> 00:10:28,630
IMMIGRANTS OF THEIR BORDER.

364
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:29,665
EVERYBODY IS RACIST IF THEY

365
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:34,570
DON'T AGREE WITH YOU.

366
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:37,339
YOUR FILTER IS NOTHING BUT RACE.

367
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,006
>> Juan: I THINK YOU HAVE A

368
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:39,308
DIFFICULTY ACKNOWLEDGING WHERE

369
00:10:39,309 --> 00:00:00,000
THERE IS RACIAL INJUSTICE AND
