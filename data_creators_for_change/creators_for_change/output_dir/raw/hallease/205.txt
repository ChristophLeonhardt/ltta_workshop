thoughts on things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Netflix and nude</font>

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,690
IRS

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,520
I filed my husband and I file<font color="#CCCCCC"> our taxes</font>

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,220
for 2012 earlier this year as did

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,660
everyone else in America hopefully

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,490
unless you're evading your taxes than

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,500
you probably didn't anyway um we file

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,210
our taxes everything went well<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,330
refunds then I started getting notices

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,590
started getting all these notice in the

15
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,600
mail like your social security number in

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,550

17
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,220

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,610
that mom hold forever and it was big

19
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,710
shenanigan and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to drive to the</font>

20
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,600
social security office which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I</font>

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,750
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even like a good 25 miles away</font>

22
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">from my house which really isn't that</font>

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,830
far it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> inconvenience and then I had</font>

24
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to sit there in the social security</font>

25
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,860
office with all the other people there

26
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,790
and get like stereotypical looks at me

27
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,560
like why is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> person here getting</font>

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,720
welfare checks she's milking the

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,570
government finally I get up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the desk</font>

30
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,430

<font color="#CCCCCC">like no I mean we have it updated you</font>

36
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,710
know you changed your<font color="#E5E5E5"> name about a week</font>

37
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,450
after you got married must be something

38
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,730
over there let me just hit this one

39
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,550
button and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they get this</font>

40
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,330
update to the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the social</font>

41
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,710
security office is credit they were very

42
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,260
lovely people and so after<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that on</font>

43
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,210
my way home on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my long drive home</font>

44
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,060
because thatÃ­s it in Austin traffic I

45
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:55,060
really got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about names and</font>

46
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,540
what they mean you know um and why they

47
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,610
matter and it also got me thinking into

48
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">the just the institution of marriage as</font>

49
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,870
a whole from a traditional perspective

50
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,730
you know there's like this series of

51
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,709
events that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think women have to go</font>

52
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:12,349
through when they get married<font color="#CCCCCC"> that men</font>

53
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:14,480
don't traditionally<font color="#CCCCCC"> a man proposes to</font>

54
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,670
the woman hopefully she says yes she

55
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,870
doesn't I mean they got some shipping

56
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,480
you talked about but you know um she

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,250
says yes and then she's engaged and she

58
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,489
has this physical marker showing you

59
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:28,069
know every other man in the world

60
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:31,370
basically that someone else's got dibs

61
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,290
and

62
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,040
you are being a great disrespect if you

63
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,900
do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> honor the dibs that have been</font>

64
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,439
dibbed you know but men don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that</font>

65
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,670
men get engaged and they don't

66
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,829
traditionally they don't have any

67
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,870
physical indicator that they're taken

68
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,939
and so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost as if men can just</font>

69
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:53,250
easily walk away if that makes sense

70
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,659
it's very mess it's very misogynistic

71
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:59,049
like a lot and I didn't realize that

72
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:01,659
until I had to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IRS it's</font>

73
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:04,150
upsetting like it's upsetting me you

74
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,180
know um Chris didn't have to sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

75
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,680
phone with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IRS for like five hours</font>

76
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,989
and figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I had to</font>

77
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:13,510
because I was the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change my name</font>

78
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,730
all he has to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like check a box</font>

79
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,599
like I'm married now and that's and put

80
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,010
a ring on you know i mean and i'm not

81
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,870
saying women don't do things when

82
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,189
they're married of course they do they

83
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:26,500
put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their fair share just as much as</font>

84
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,799
women do but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just within our</font>

85
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,970
society there's a lot of misogyny you

86
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,639
know about this whole name thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

87
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,620
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize the true value of my name</font>

88
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:47,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">until this and also when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i filed to get</font>

89
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:49,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">married I didn't realize how much I</font>

90
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:51,549
appreciated my name and what it really

91
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:55,900
meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me until I had to change it for</font>

92
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,199
me was<font color="#CCCCCC"> really difficult because you know</font>

93
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,389
I go by my middle name I go by<font color="#CCCCCC"> holly's</font>

94
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:04,299
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a freelancer so my middle name</font>

95
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:06,040
its kind of might the name you go by

96
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,229
it's kind of like her brand almost you

97
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:10,659
know it it's how you label yourself and

98
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:11,709
tell people meet you it's how you

99
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,810
network your brand and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I knew I</font>

100
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,510
couldn't drop it I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go by my</font>

101
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,238
true first name and not have my middle

102
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:20,858
name somewhere in there so I didn't want

103
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:21,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hyphenate because I didn't want to be</font>

104
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that guy so I really had only had one</font>

105
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,659
choice which was to just drop it

106
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:29,800
altogether and so technically on my

107
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,870
marriage license my maiden name isn't

108
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,169
anywhere on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

109
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:37,939
and and and that stings yeah I'm married

110
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:40,580
and I'm part of this other family now

111
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,889
too<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I'm not forsaking my own the</font>

112
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,439
Clemens blood runs strong through my

113
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,319
veins<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I mean and it's part of who I</font>

114
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,120
am it's never gonna leave me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and I</font>

115
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,860
didn't realize how important proclaiming

116
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,159
that part of me on paper was I mean now

117
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:01,759
my my social security and my driver's

118
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,029
license say all four names and it's nice

119
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:07,310
and long and ridiculous but I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

120
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,499
that way I like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has all four and</font>

121
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:14,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">i like that i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to forsake the</font>

122
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,900
name i had um knowing what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know now</font>

123
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,319
and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having this revelation</font>

124
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:25,639
inside me now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could go back I don't</font>

125
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,930
know if I would even change my name at

126
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:33,319
all honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i would probably I</font>

127
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,629
mean obviously I would talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my</font>

128
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:37,699
husband about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for a while before</font>

129
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:40,099
deciding what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

130
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:43,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would change my name and so I I pose</font>

131
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:46,909
this to you women who are thinking about

132
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:50,599
getting married or engaged or you need

133
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:51,680
to be engaged<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about what you want</font>

134
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be called um think about it what</font>

135
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">value do you hold on what you're called</font>

136
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:02,120
you know what value do you hold on the

137
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,539
letters<font color="#CCCCCC"> that make up what people know</font>

138
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:09,560
you by and whether it be from a branding

139
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,050
perspective or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> government perspective</font>

140
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:18,020
or personally and what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you willing</font>

141
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,460
to give up you know for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> person you</font>

142
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:27,529
love and that's my deep thought for the

143
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,560
day

144
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,780
what did homosexual couples do though

145
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,570
like real<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk do they pick a name to go</font>

146
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">by do they even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do they change names at</font>

147
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">all I don't know any homosexual couples</font>

148
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,370
that are legally married so I can't ask

149
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,940
anybody that's a bummer

150
00:06:50,940 --> 00:00:00,000
you
