hi so you remember these crazy maths
problems that make you solve in school
yeah what was that for oh man what time
is it six hours ago it was two hours
later than three hours before midnight
your first day in real life people just
tell you the answers
I mean imagine this scenario thank you
so much for coming by the way thanks for
having me and as my younger sister how
old are you oh well I'm five years older
than Ana and in ten years time and will
be half the age of mine what age is Ana
okay yeah you got to stop doing that no
but really when you get to use these
skills look at Roma with an unidentified
angle and to identify angles let's solve
it you better let me kill you or my
favorite never applicable in real life
problem but I can't remember anybody's
name I know it's crazy right
don't even have a people's hands are
shaking oh well there were eight people
at the party before you arrived
everybody shook hands with each other
exactly once when you the ninth doesn't
arrived usually no you're not this this
is why you don't have a boyfriend
I would be your boyfriend to be fair
though I haven't applied any lessons
that I've learnt in school I always take
candy from strangers they have the best
they can fit heaps and those massive
coat pockets of theirs
no I don't know I think I'm just jealous
because whenever I look at kids homework
these days I can't solve the problems
anymore
I just google everything but hey here's
one for you this is a pretend car it's
pretend manual girl yeah if I'm driving
and I have a hundred and twenty
kilometres to my destination and I'm
driving at 40 km/h and I've been driving
for two hours so far how long until I
reach my destination
it's like the waiting menu but you have
to pick soon because I'm gonna have to
stop the video soon but now
