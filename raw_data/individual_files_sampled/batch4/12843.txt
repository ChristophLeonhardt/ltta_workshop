so where did you get the work ethic from because sounds like your mom wasn't big into it and yet you're somebody who's working hard basically from the time that you left high school and I know you were into football when you're in high school as well yeah it I learned my work ethic from sports probably football which was a really hard taxing sort of hot you know like I learned football will teach you discomfort and how to kind of tolerate discomfort because when you're in the San Fernando Valley and you're running you're doing two-a-days in early September and it's brutal outside and they think water is bad for you like just rinse don't you know literally like spit it out you'll cramp up like I'm deeply pleased and you're just running wind sprints in like full full gear it's crazy it's kind it's like the military so I probably learned that but later on I just learned that I had to use my back to make money so I didn't have any kind of there was no path in intellectually to get paid so if I was gonna get paid it was it was gonna be because there was a stack of drywall over there and you needed that stack of drywall moved over there and that's how I got paid and and and in literally digging ditches and just demoing out stucco and hauling garbage you know like that that's all I did I had jobs where I just get dropped off at the pier 1 imports now on Wilshire in Santa Monica we built it a million years ago and there's just a huge pile of dirt like like size of like two minivans and they gave me a shovel the wheelbarrow and they're like the dumpsters over there and they're like however long it takes you to get that into that then you can leave house this alone just like all day just scoop you know one load at a time like counting my steps and trying not to go insane but anyway as someone whom once picked up an object that sounds terrible with me yeah I could definitely this did not be in the Shapiro wheelhouse in 1996 Ben Shapiro picked up a feather duster and candidate to one of its wires but that's still valid
