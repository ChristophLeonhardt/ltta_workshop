you down with TPP we don't know if Trump is as he has several issues the president's view on TPP has wavered over the last two years waivered is a nice way to put it in fact the trade pact was one of trumps biggest targets during the 2016 campaign in which he called it a rape of our country with rhetoric like that it was no surprise that he signed an executive order withdrawing the United States from the agreement just three days after he took office that seemed to be the end of the story until last Thursday remember Larry Kudlow joined the party when he reportedly told his chief economic advisor Kudlow and US trade rep Pablo Kaiser to look at getting us back into the agreement he clarified those reports later that evening tweeting that he would only join the TPP if the deal were substantially better than the deal that was offered to President Obama Trump tweeted again last night that quote while Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP I don't like the deal for the United States we should point out South Korea they're not even in TPP which is referred to as TPP 11 it's compromised it's comprised excuse me of 11 countries and about 15 percent of the world's trade how about that can we just take a beat here the president and my for Sean Spicer told us his Twitter use is official White House statements he's talking what South Korea wants us to do they they're not even in it way to go all right with us now Steve Rattner he's a chairman of will and advisers and President Obama so-called car czar who knows a great deal about economics and trade Garrett Haake had a conversation with a Republican senator orrin hatch about the president and TPP this morning say first reaction we've had from Republicans about the flip-flopping the president's doing let's listen to that well I found that he has a very unique way of negotiating so I don't pay an awful lot of attention to that we have to do TPP if we want to really the atmospheric in this particular area so let's face it we we need to we need to develop our relations with these these other countries so I just want to unpack that for a second do we actually have to do TPP and some people would say yes and some people could say no and others will argue that doing trade deals with countries with lower wage rates than we have causes American jobs to be lost but it creates lower priced goods but in the end I always thought during the TPP negotiations that it was much more about gaining a lot of influence with Asian countries and trading partners the pressure on China pressure on China bingo you got it right no look I think as a trade deal you could debate it one way or another and you're right there this is about workers here and so on and so forth although trade is good but I think the lesson we have learned in the last year and a half is that we need to have a strategic position in Asia to buttress ourselves against China I think that is so clear and Trump agrees with that because he is constantly talking about China's trade practices and so TPP was the way to do that it was a national security strategic move as much or more than it was a trade move okay let's talk Shinzo ABI Japan is our fourth largest trading partner president Trump has said trade with Japan is not fair so what's gonna go down here we're wearing matching ties as you said you know you it's anybody's guess what's gonna go down look Trump's negotiating style and the way I think all this stuff is gonna unfold is he makes these outrageous demands or outrageous claims about countries says he's gonna pull out of trade agreements with them with TPP well and he did although we were never really in it we had said we were gonna go in it that hasn't been ratified actually by most members yet but whatever but I think you what you're gonna see happen here is he's gonna threaten to leave these agreements he's going to get these countries to do something Mexico has already indicated it would do something China has indicated it would do something and then he's going to declare victory and probably not much will have changed so I think with Japan you could see the same thing you could see old more opening up to us agricultural exports or things like that and he may declare victory it may not but it's interesting because whether you're Japan or your South Korea right now when you're sitting with Donald Trump if you're the new prime minister of South Korea or or the Prime Minister of Japan you actually need other things right you need President Trump not to sit down with Kim jong-un and make some deal about intercontinental ballistic missiles that leaves you at risk because Japan and South Korea are a danger from conventional weapons so they are prepared they might capitulate on certain fronts just to get the security deal done that they need yes look trade as we were talking about before the TPP trade has the so-called trade has really become a national security strategic conversation and with respect to South Korea and Japan you are right we need stuff from them but they also need stuff from us and with respect to China we need some stuff from them we want them to help us with North Korea at the same time as we're beating the you-know-what out of them yep over there unfair trade practices okay that point of China President Trump puts out these you know aggressive claims and are we starting to see some countries do this because China said last week it will relax some of their manufacturing rules for foreign car companies so allowing electric car companies to operate in China I mean like for Tesla that's a huge win can the president take that as a big victory well he will take it as a big victory but but should he he takes everything as a big thing but there's one thing to really understand about this so these car companies have been forced into these joint ventures for all these years and so in effect they leave part of their profits there that comes out of the pocket of us of shareholders not to see where shell this worldwide Sheryl it's not out of the pockets of US workers so relaxing these restrictions would allow GM to make more cars in China it actually makes a lot of cars and they actually make slightly more cars in China than in the u.s. enrollment yeah employ more Chinese people but it does employ more US people if you want to put more US people you have to talk about China's 25% tariff on imported cars so the save implied there might be space why but my point is giving us the 50/50 joint venture thing jack is not as big a win as it sounds like for American workers so pretty good win for General Motors hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date
