they don't need secret wait lists they
have actual wait lists that are just
waiting for you to wait in line for four
 years I'm tired of popping six
pills eight pills a day you know like I
don't want to deal with this how's your
pain level when you're driving no it
sucks I'm just trying to get information
on what doctor I saw and I just haven't
heard anything yeah I'm gonna write you
know in order to get my back diagnosed
it took two years that's because it took
six months to get an MRI then after you
get your MRI takes another three months
ago see the specialist that sees the MRI
you gotta wait another three months ago
see your primary care physician in order
for him to schedule you with another
specialist that takes another six months
so here you are years down the
line before they even know what's wrong
I got out five years ago and I'm waiting
you know good luck to the guy that's
getting out right now the good
luck to you and bro
you
