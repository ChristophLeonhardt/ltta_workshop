now thousands are taking to the streets across France at the moment to protest again against President macrons reforms they are part of 3-month long transport strikes that have paralyzed the country okay well let's get the latest now from the heart of Paris with our correspondent there Charlotte dibinsky Charlotte we've seen some violence earlier have things calm down that well we're in the middle of what seems to be a standoff between some of the protesters and the police just take our look behind me Andrew you can see a row of the police fans the shunned armory they're all out there in their riot gear blocking off this particular route and some of the protesters are taunting them now they've also been using as smoke flares to draw attention to what they're doing they've lit fires to some of the bins and they've also been throwing projectiles towards the police glass bottles we've also seen rocks thrown at the police cans anything that they can get their hands on and then of course the police have been responding with tear gas and we've also had the water Bowser's the water cannons at to try and calm the protesters down to try and cool them down that hasn't really worked and as you can see some protesters now who not to be part of the CGT Union are actually sitting down as a sitting protest but just take a look behind me on the other side and you might sort of get a sense of just how many people have come here this is the end of the route of the protest at plus Italy and this is where thousands of people are now gathering to show their discontentment not just with the reforms to the railway which is the primary reason for this protest today but also people unhappy with the macron government particularly the anti capitalists who are the ones that we have seen mainly engaged in those clashes with the police today they've done everything I mean I've seen them use some new tactics there including removing bottles directly from recycling banks to throw at the police but that teargas has been coming down and down as you can see this row of people now is getting larger as they take their protests to the police what you can hear there sounds like a sound grenade going off but there is plenty of teargas that's been deployed today and this standoff looks like it's going to continue for some time as you can see the police looking like they're making some sort of small tactical retreat now but they are likely therefore to make a barrier elsewhere as you see them doing now to try and keep the protesters in to one spot until they can either disperse them using tear gas and water cannons or if they disperse naturally themselves this protest was meant to be about reforms of Mekons governments it's once again turned into a clash between the police and a small group of anti-capitalist protesters okay Charlotte thanks for the update that was Charlie Dubinsky there from the heart of Paris well meanwhile in the southern French city of Marseille thousands have taken to the streets there and a stop macron march denouncing the French president's reforms and have a look at some of the latest pictures it was organized by the left-wing party leader jean-luc m√©lenchon
