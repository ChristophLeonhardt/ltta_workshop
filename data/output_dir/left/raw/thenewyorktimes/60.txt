1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,340
“Please raise
your right hand.”

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,855
These are the Supreme Court
confirmation hearings —

3
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:06,000
“This is day two.”

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,951
— you’re probably
all familiar with.

5
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:08,450
“Bigly.”

6
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,530
“You just said ‘bigly.’”

7
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,100
“Bigly.”

8
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,280
Big partisan productions —

9
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:13,652
"A charade and
a mockery."

10
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:15,770
“Anything else you want
to say, Judge Bork?”

11
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,410
— that dominate the
headlines and the airwaves.

12
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,640
This is how they used to be.

13
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,592
[crickets]

14
00:00:20,592 --> 00:00:22,370
Yeah, there actually
weren’t any.

15
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,750
So how did we
get from here —

16
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,640
[crickets]

17
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,480
— to here?

18
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,290
We’ll start in 1937 with
former Senator Hugo Black,

19
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,150
who’s being congratulated.

20
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,880
That’s because
he’s just been confirmed

21
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,690
as a Supreme Court Justice.

22
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,620
He’s also been outed
as a former member

23
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,380
of the Ku Klux Klan.

24
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,930
So to explain himself,
he gets on the radio.

25
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,120
“I did join the Klan.

26
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,790
I later resigned.

27
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,250
I never rejoined.”

28
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,949
People are not happy.

29
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:52,570
They’re basically asking:
How could the

30
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,160
Senate Judiciary Committee
let this guy through?

31
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,150
Answer:

32
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,510
Since the first hearing
back in 1873, for this guy,

33
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,490
there were no standard
ways of holding hearings

34
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,320
for Supreme Court nominees.

35
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,060
They didn’t have
to go and testify,

36
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,820
and the hearings didn’t
need to be made public.

37
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,060
The senators reviewed the
nominees among themselves.

38
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,560
But then came a
couple of amendments

39
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,850
to the Constitution.

40
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,670
The upshot is they gave more
voting power to the people.

41
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,920
So the senators needed to
start paying more attention

42
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,096
to public opinion.

43
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:21,470
And they’re paying
attention when

44
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,540
Black’s controversial
confirmation

45
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,854
drives Americans to ask: Why
are these hearings private?

46
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,020
It’s a big reason why the
next nominee to come along

47
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,820
gets a public hearing.

48
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,290
And it’s not just
a public hearing,

49
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,300
it’s the first
that includes

50
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,040
no-holds-barred questioning
by the committee.

51
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,260
Things are
beginning to change.

52
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,160
Then World War II
comes, and goes.

53
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,120
America is suddenly
a superpower.

54
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,030
Business booms,
suburbs grow.

55
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,830
“The protest took the
form of a boycott.”

56
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,630
And we see the beginning of
the modern civil-rights era.

57
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,870
In 1954, the court rules
to end racial segregation

58
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,457
in schools.

59
00:01:57,457 --> 00:01:59,040
And this marks a
point where we really

60
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,320
start to see the court
using its power to shape

61
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,720
parts of American society.

62
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,970
That means Americans
take a greater interest

63
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,350
in who is on the court.

64
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,690
That means even more
pressure on senators

65
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,602
to vet these candidates.

66
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:14,480
Starting with the first nominee
after the Brown decision,

67
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,510
almost every nominee
will have a public hearing.

68
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,460
Now change is in full swing.

69
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,710
“I Have a Dream,” the
march from Selma,

70
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,300
“The Feminine Mystique.”

71
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,760
The court keeps making
controversial rulings

72
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,100
on race discrimination,
gender discrimination,

73
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,480
personal privacy.

74
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,190
That means more
public interest,

75
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,200
more pressure on
senators, more issues

76
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,700
to parse in the hearings.

77
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,800
So the hearings get longer.

78
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,098
But just wait.

79
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,670
1981 — game changer.

80
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,520
“Good evening.

81
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,660
Sandra O’Connor —”

82
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,840
First woman nominated
to the Supreme Court,

83
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,970
first nomination
hearing to be televised.

84
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,670
The longer senators talk,
the more TV time they get.

85
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,250
The more TV time
they get, the more

86
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,420
they can posture for
voters watching at home.

87
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,950
[senators talking]

88
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,409
So the more they talk.

89
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:04,110
With the cameras rolling,
we’ll see

90
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,120
10 out of the 12
longest hearings ever.

91
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,280
One of those is
for Robert Bork —

92
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,020
“With a negative
recommendation

93
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,760
of 9 to 5.”

94
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,100
— who famously
doesn’t make the cut.

95
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,920
Now onto the aughts.

96
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,240
There’s an 11-year gap
between nominees.

97
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,150
Meanwhile, America has become
more politically divided,

98
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,320
so has the Senate.

99
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,785
“Over and over again —”

100
00:03:23,785 --> 00:03:24,580
“Wait just a second —”

101
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,000
“How many times do we do
this before —”

102
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,699
Here’s Chief Justice Roberts
to explain

103
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:31,120
what happened next.

104
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,570
“I mean, you look at two of
my colleagues, Justice Scalia

105
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,940
and Justice Ginsburg,
for example.

106
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,540
Maybe there were two or
three dissenting votes

107
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,150
between the two of them.”

108
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,230
Yep, three votes against
Ginsburg in 1993.

109
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,320
No votes against
Scalia in 1986.

110
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,390
“Now you look at my
more recent colleagues

111
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,800
and the votes were, I think,
strictly on party lines.”

112
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,270
That’s pretty much right.

113
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,340
“And that doesn’t
make any sense.”

114
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,700
And that’s how we got here.

115
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,290
“I’m not looking to take
us back to quill pens.”

116
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,110
Very long —

117
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,580
“Nah, I just asked you where
you were at on Christmas.”

118
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,265
[laughter]

119
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:07,390
Always very political —

120
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,710
“So your failure to answer
questions is confounding me.”

121
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,680
— very public Supreme Court
confirmation hearings.

122
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,180
Also, something else to notice:
Sometimes these nominees

123
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,740
give pretty similar answers.

124
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,870
“The right to
privacy is protected

125
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,150
under the Constitution
in various ways.”

126
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,850
“And it protects the right to
privacy in a number of ways.”

127
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,330
“In various places
in the Constitution.”

128
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,675
“In a variety of places
in the Constitution.”

129
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:35,710
“It’s protected by
the Fourth Amendment.”

130
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,870
“The Fourth Amendment
certainly speaks

131
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,355
to the right of privacy.”

132
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:42,040
“It’s founded in the
Fourth Amendment.”

133
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,810
“The first and
most obvious place

134
00:04:43,810 --> 00:00:00,000
is the Fourth Amendment.”
