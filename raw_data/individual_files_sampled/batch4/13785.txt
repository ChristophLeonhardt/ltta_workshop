students across the country are cutting class today and the mainstream media couldn't be happier finally finally students are cutting class this is big we will discuss the national student walkout to infringe on our civil rights in the broader context of the awful legacy of student activism in America then the most important takeaways from the special election last night in Pennsylvania and why basically I'm happy the Democrat one finally I will defend United Airlines after a puppy died on one of their flights I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael no leo that is a lot for one show this is going to be a big show going after cute kids applauding a Democrat victory and defending dead puppies that is a lot even for me but we have to do it what can we do first before we do that we I have to talk about something because you know we all we work out our brains on this show we work it out we catch a lot of cultural news and political news but you've got to work out your body to our founding fathers knew this they Jefferson wrote about this all the time they the ancient Greeks knew this the wisest people in history knew you need to have a strong body even our Lord Himself was a

sponsor which is Beachbody on demand they help us keep the lights on that's good that's a good in and of itself but also they are an excellent new company that will help you work out and it's a very 2018 way to do it I don't I don't like to do a lot of old-fashioned things like get up or go to the store or join a gym or any I don't I don't do that I am a millennial I like to sit in my chair and

3.14 but it's a big national activist national national day how do I know that because the mainstream media told me ahead of a planned student walkout on Wednesday a nationwide student walkout is planned later this week for stricter gun laws schools around the country are bracing for a series of student walk outs to protest gun violence a student walkout is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday across the country schools in all 50 states bracing for protests did you hear that students did you catch that 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday and it's in all 50 states so don't worry we're gonna repeat this on every news program all day until you realize and actually go out there and cut class the mainstream media always do this the mainstream media stoke the flames of these protests just such a degree they basically create them they didn't even just say there's you know on Facebook they're talking about a walkout they actually said it's gonna be at this time and don't worry if you're in Mississippi or New York it's gonna be all over this time you got to do it you know there's another kid in all of this there's another one of these teenagers a friend of the show we brought him on to talk about the not to talk about guns but to talk about the media Kyle cash of and he has I got to say I'm not for high school kids going around and being used as political pawns or anything but Kyle much more than any of his classmates has really comported himself respectfully he's been respectful to his elders to elected people he's been kind of serious he hasn't been just relentlessly attacking one politician or another politician there were a lot of photos I guess he had meetings with everybody with Chuck Schumer President Trump in the Oval Office a lot you know that is actually something really spectacular we've never seen that with student activism recently and it that doesn't get covered that's not what gets covered on TV because it doesn't push the agenda the mainstream media have to publicize this left-wing administration so really they effectively created notice to they publicize it as a national event so what happens it becomes a national event if they publicize it as a New York event it'd be in New York event but they publicized it as a national event then they have to sell it though so they turn up the emotion and they can plate lots of different unconnect and stories of trauma to push their entirely unconnected gun grabbing legislation here it is teachers say some even had personal stories to tell about the toll of gun violence every year somebody's cousin somebody's dad somebody's aunt without guns ain't gonna be no more killing and stuff like that but with with guns gonna be a Louisville killing because people don't know how to control their selves with guns and they act foolish with them students also discussed ways to frame their message during the plant walkout on Wednesday to have the strongest impact on the gun control debate to frame their message I don't know if you saw in that video there's a teacher hovering over the kid making sure the kid writes the correct thing on the construction paper or you know anti-trump we need more gun control or whatever but did you catch even the words that they had these kids say at the beginning that the students said you know somebody's aunt got killed somebody's father gets killed from guns I don't think they got killed at schools I don't think that's about school shootings anymore I think you're talking about bad neighborhoods and criminals killing people that's not that isn't this that has nothing to do with keeping a school safe that has nothing to do with school shootings so they're trying to lump this into all guns all gun crime but of course school shootings have been on the decline for 25 years 30 years we know that mass shootings have been on the decline for 25 or 30 years we know that most gun deaths gun crime or suicides by middle-aged men then you see that other students say Trump you need to do something Trump you need to what does from need to do Howard Donald Trump responsible for these shootings we know that the shooting in Florida was was caused in no small part because of that County led the nation in pushing a left-wing policy for student discipline in fact the Obama administration adopted the policy that was pioneered by that school district by Broward County and that district was less discipline don't put the kid in touch with the cops don't just ignore brush it under the rug that was it that's actually a policy that Donald Trump opposes so really what we should have been seeing this with Barack Obama do something brought Bhama you need to do something but of course we don't see that that doesn't feed the narrative it's not like there weren't school shootings during the Obama administration but that doesn't match the narrative now Trump is president so now we need Trump we need to do something then the final statement from that that student said without guns there won't be more killing guns are a relatively new invention in world history they haven't been around forever I'm just right you know right now I'm reading the book of Joshua in the Bible I'm doing the Bible in a year I'm I'm no expert I'm not you know I'm not a credentialed historian I think there was killing before guns I think there was I think the imagination of man's heart is evil from the beginning I suspect that so and that isn't true and places where these gun bans have been tried by the way that that hasn't necessarily reduced homicides and it hasn't necessarily reduced crime certainly and also gun bans are basically impossible even in Australia where they have the most sweeping gun ban two-thirds of people kept their guns in America there are more guns than people in the United States so to say without guns there there won't be more killing that's ridiculous also these rifles that people are trying to ban account for virtually no deaths each year particularly compared to knives particularly compared to hands and feet and certainly compared to handguns so if we're talking about blanket ban of all guns that's one thing but notice how we're getting conflated everything is getting conflated here stop school shootings ban ar-15s for some reason it's Donald Trump's fault we need to ban all guns no guns working right what it doesn't it's so blurry but that's what the media want what is the endgame here for the media because they have all these different purported goals what did the media really want out of all of this Michael take it away there's gonna be a massive student walkout Friday afternoon tomorrow in Indiana 20,000 people you mentioned there hopefully more at the State Capitol this this has to continue day after day after day and these governors have are gonna have to step down they're going to be recalled they're gonna be impeached they've broken the law there's no way they can get away with this how does it make a difference for people to protest how does it make a difference that student walkout tonight in Madison how does it translate into it they're making a difference it's all it's already made look at the change this of the polls you cited just in one month the public opinion of the governor of Wisconsin of the legislature of our support for unions and their rights everything has turned in favor of the working people and it's because the people in Madison the people of Wisconsin have stood up and have been there every single day and they've helped to turn people around on this the American people have woken up I got to tell you this is another there's gonna be another aspect to the show I'll compliment Michael Moore and Rachel Maddow at least they're honest at least Moore and Maddow or honest here and you notice this with a few of them more predicted that the Trump would win and he kind of saw why and Rachel Maddow compared to her colleagues at MSNBC is pretty upfront about her views and is pretty honest about what she wants this is all about electing Democrats and hurting Republicans that's what it's about that's what the national student cutting class is about that's what all of the media coverage is about this is why if none of these things happen during the Obama administration this is about electing Democrats and hurting Republicans it's not about kids it's not about crime statistics it's not about murders it's not even about guns it's about pushing their political agenda of which guns play only a small role there's so much more to talk but I got you know before we talk about that I've we got I get so overwhelmed with all these bad things like electing Democrats and hurting Republicans I forget sometimes we got to talk about good things and one of the good things we need to talk about is thrive market I really like thrive market and I use their products all the time it's because thrive market makes it so so easy to save money get excellent quality groceries and not have to leave your couch when you do it do the math you buy your family $500 worth of organic groceries in one month and then you can pay only $200 for them imagine that what's the secret weapon thrive market calm the largest online store in the country selling exclusively non-gmo organic groceries and guaranteed savings up to 50% off retail prices excuse me in my bachelor days before finding sweet little Alisa I was only eating GMOs I would I would just I'd see a big pile of GMOs I just dip my face into it just rummage around like oh like a pig in muck but now I you know I try to treat myself a little better or work out a little bit try to eat better food and the thrive market is a wonderful way to do it instead of paying 16 dollars for your favorite almond butter at the store you can pay only $11 on market instead of $25 for extra-virgin olive oil I being Italian I always make sure to spend on extra-virgin olive oil I don't want any of that yellow stuff that's

not making money on that because that is way below the normal price but take advantage of it while you can folks come on do it you'd be foolish not to okay this is that's what all of these protests are about electing Democrats over Republicans this is exactly the same thing as amnesty with free illegal aliens I promise you if illegal aliens were coming across the border right now and they were identifying three times 28.7 five times Republican / Democrat the there would be deportation trains being commandeered by Democrats they would be the engineer saying choo choo sending him right back across how do I know that because they do that with Cubans Cubans to Cuban refugees tend to vote for Republicans over Democrats because they see what socialism does and their lives have been ruined by it and their families had me killed and tortured and oppressed by it so they tend to vote for Republicans and what did Barack Obama do he repealed the wet foot dry foot policy there was a policy in the United States whereby if Cuban refugees came over and made it to the United States shores they would they would be legal here they wouldn't be deported Obama got rid of that why well because it comes what why is it Cuban worth less than a hundred why why does a Cuban national have to be deported back immediately but a Honduran national gets to stay and is a dreamer and needs a path to citizenship and all of that it's because of a very cynical political calculation it's sad but it's true the if this situation were reversed you would see you would see opposite of feelings on this but that's that's the Democrat they have their electoral strategy they actually released it in a memo they said illegal and amnesty is is necessary for our electoral viability that it is always a cynical calculation when it comes to these big national events this is the reason we don't let 16 year-olds vote it's this whole thing about we gotta listen to the kids out of the mouths of babes we got to listen to kids no no we don't they don't the kids don't know anything that's why we don't let them vote they don't know anything their students their students because they don't know things and then hopefully by the end of being students they will know things they learn things that isn't necessarily the case in our current educational system even at some of the best schools in the country but that is the idea they don't know anything Democrats want to lower the voting age because they thrive on ignorant and Democrat candidates thrive on ignorance last March California Democrats proposed ACA 10:00 to lower the voting age to 17 why is that Democrat Assemblyman Evelyn evan lo said young people are our future all right I guess sure yeah they're young people are young young people are young that's really profound and so we need to let them vote because they vote for Democrats if they voted for Republicans they'd be trying to raise the voting age to 65 which I'm kind of trying to do George Soros is backing this measure through his open society foundation and the fair vote group also they're pushing for pre-registration starting at 16 they want 16 year-olds to be able to pre-register to vote by the way that already exists in 20 states and in the District of Columbia this sort of activism is all is so shallow and it's so tawdry and it's so modern the trend today on Twitter maybe I couldn't have written it better you cut a short story author couldn't written it better the trend was students stand up hashtags students stand up they stand they don't learn they stand if they don't they don't read books they stand they will go to class they stand michael Oakshott writes about this in rationalism and politics he writes that the the rationalist he's always standing for something he's never moving he's never doing anything he's not bettering himself he's just kind of standing standing there and you know I'm just occupying Wall Street just do Purdue yeah hey hey what are you doing nothing just standing just occupying this this is part and parcel of student Act the United States and its dreadful history here student activism from the beginning of it to the end it is riddled with ignorant sand kids being used as useful idiots for nefarious American foes it began really as a national phenomenon in the 1930s when communists founded the American Youth Congress and I'm not talking about small SI communists like your little Marxist professor really I mean big si communists like the American Youth Congress received its orders from the Communist Party USA and Comintern the International communist organization founded and controlled by the Soviet Union it had a direct line from Moscow the the American Youth Congress was among common turns most successful front groups especially in the United States the American Youth Congress even attracted the support of Eleanor Roosevelt unsurprising perhaps to some of us the counterculture of the 1960s and 70s was driven by student activism the major student activist group at that time was SDS students for a Democratic Society it finally disbanded thankfully because it blew a lot of stuff up but it actually was refounded in 2006 which shows you it's a sign of the times and there's a new students for Democratic Society god help us the representative group of the new left was the students for a Democratic Society this was really radical and all another group of useful idiots for the Soviet Union this was the beginning of the end for Democrats as a serious mature political party by the way because Democrat you know there was a kind of liberal consensus Democrats and Republicans were they were different but they were both Pro America they both supported Americans they both supported American victory in war that changed with the new left I'm not being hyperbolic here the new left actually existed to change that so then the new Left existed to undermine American war efforts to diminish American power around the world to try to hollow out America from within that's the new left that's when you saw you know people talk about the parties switching they say oh well you know the Republicans used to be the good guys and the Democrats used to be the bad guys and then one day around all the time that our parents became of age then they just switched and then I'll just swear they say okay you'll be a republic I'll be a Democrat that we're now we're gonna switch but part of that realignment there was a realignment geographically to a lot of that is because of the new left it's where you saw blue dog down let's break off and say I'm a Democrat but I like America so what in this this party is so anti America it's so shrill it's especially in issues of life it's it's so fanatically in favor of abortion I can't be a Democrat anymore so you saw people who were a little more socially conservative and people who liked their country and were more patriotic went to the Republican Party that's part of the big shift it happened in large part because of student activism the SDS then gave rise to the Weather Underground a domestic terror group that tried to overthrow the US government by bombing and murdering a bunch of people in the 70s I should be careful with my words here and when I said that they murdered a bunch of people the group was founded by Barack Obama's mentor Bill Ayers they had a close relationship in Chicago Bill Ayers also a violent communist when I say they murdered a bunch of people I don't mean that they murdered their targets or their adversaries fortunately the left in in The Weather Underground were so incompetent that they ended up just killing of their own members because they didn't know how to set off bombs when they're trying to destroy buildings and overthrow the government that we have to always thank the ignorance and incompetence of the left because they did blow themselves up a few times not enough but a few times SDS helped lead the willard straight Hall takeover at Cornell University in 1969 this this was when armed students came in with guns and just took over Cornell University notice a theme here all of the student protests evolved walking out we're staying or all in all just putting a stop to learning no more learning no we have this stuff we have to destroy buildings we have to break down University buildings we need to stop people from going to class in Cornell you saw people walking down the hall he said hey hey ho ho Western Civ has got to go hey hey and they're in there it's a double entendre on the one hand it's we need to stop teaching people Western civilization we need to start teaching them god knows what communist nonsense but on the other critical theory or something on the other hand it's also saying what because we're gonna stop teaching it to them hopefully we can end Western civilization itself we can hollow out Western civilization itself and move on to some other utopian a dream some other utopian fantasy coincidentally a professor of mine in college was at Cornell at the time Don Kay Donald Kagan and he just kept teaching during all that mayhem that was his protest that way that that's a real protest is the on the national student walkout day the real protest is to stay in class and listen and learn something and do what you're supposed to do and don't act like a little bratty child we've seen other student activism in recent years obviously we saw the shrieking girl at Yale you all remember her I can't play that clip again so it's so devastating like it's on the one hand it's very funny on the other hand it makes me so sad and weep for that institution are you so kony2012 obviously a really important activist moment the door for protests they didn't didn't result in anything did it but students walked out and they I don't know they smoked pot on in Central Park I remember this when I was in high school walk outs over the Iraq war I was in middle school during the Iraq war and I remember there's a walk out all these middle school students or a sit-in or whatever and these are like 12 year old kids 11 year old kids why did they walk out is they want to cut class kids always want to cut class let's see dummy is what are you doing but they don't 12 year old doesn't understand war doesn't understand much of anything that's why they're in school to learn but what the left tries to do is just turn up that arrogance turn up that hubris turn up that pride turn down the humility and when you do that it prevents them from learning and it makes you an easier pawn if you're ignorant you're more of a pawn they always involve walkouts they always involve a stop to learning we have so much news to talk about you're telling me I got to sign off first that is oh now that we have we got today get some really good stuff I got to tell you why I'm basically happy the Democrat won and I have to defend dead puppies really and you're gonna miss all that if you're not at Daley wired.com I'm sorry guys what happens if you're on YouTube no you're not if you're on Facebook go to daily wire.com right now what you can do them is you'll get me you'll get the under Clavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show you get to ask questions during the conversation it's an hour long conversation between either drew they're me or Ben and you can ask questions everybody can watch only subscribers can ask questions same with the mailbag many are called but few were chosen we're gonna have the mailbag tomorrow I can answer all of your very important questions but only if you subscribe none of that matters I know you don't care about that you care about is this because we're not gonna pass gun control we're not gonna take away people's constitutionally protected civil rights Americans are gonna remain free sorry left is they're gonna remain free and then they're gonna sob they're gonna cry so so much and you're gonna need this where you're gonna drown look I know you want to protect your civil rights I know you want to be able to defend yourself that's an important thing but it's not just the guns guys you need sometimes the best offense is a good defense you know get the is that how the saying goes on get the leftist here's tumblr it's the only fda-approved vessel to store your salty and delicious leftist tears go to daily wire calm we'll be right back all right we got to talk about Pennsylvania the race isn't over obviously though it came down to like four votes or something so it's probably gonna trigger a recount it's probably gonna go to court they've got a count absentee ballots which usually don't matter this time looks like they will blah blah blah Democrats tend to win these things when it comes down to these little minut that I don't know some of you have those crafty little Democrats in government they usually eat get add in the end that's fine I'm gonna look on the bright side of all this if a Democrat had to win one of these elections they didn't where they were predicting in Florida we're gonna Turner in Texas rather we're gonna turn Texas blue this is gonna be it and they didn't turn Texas blue and it's kind of shut up about it you notice if they had to win one of these things I'm glad it was this one I am glad it was this one these this election means nothing practically practically it means nothing it's a warning which I like but it's practically meaningless the gerrymandered district pa-18 will not exist in November there's going to be another election in November just a few months from now it's being broken up Connor Lamb who probably won this election will run in a new district likely Pennsylvania seventeen where he lives in November at which point eighty percent of the district will be new to him so incumbency does help candidates generally but it doesn't doesn't help candidates if you're 80% in a new district so and I'll give a few excuses for Republicans probably losing this race by 7 votes or whatever despite the last few years of Republicans running here Democrats still hold a registration advantage of major registration advantage it's probably all those dead people and like 13 year old aliens from Mars or something but still they hold a major registration advantage also Connor lamb was a better candidate he was a better candidate than the Republican Rick : a lamb out raised him five to one he's better looking he's more articulate he's more exciting and most important of all lamb ran is a fairly moderate even slightly Republican candidate the left is now saying that's those are excuses it is an excuse but it's also an explanation you can't deny he ran as a moderate and kind of Republican candidate particularly relative to the far left movements of the Democrats so he wouldn't endorse Obamacare he said that he would work with either party on health care he supported tax cuts but he said he opposed Trump's tax cuts but he supports tax cuts but not just not that one them for so I don't like that one for whatever reason he ran against gun control good that's I mean Democrats don't do that especially now but he did because he knew that he had to be more Republican to win he supported Trump's actions on the on the steel and aluminum tariffs and on abortion he pulled the Mario Cuomo the classic Cuomo he says I'm personally against abortion but I'm Polly vit should be a right which is just another way of saying I would never kill my precious babies but all of those poor people and all of those minorities they should kill their babies but I would never kill mine or precious and valuable but all of your all those other people they don't know let's kill them that's what he said but you know whatever I guess it works electorally among some constituencies given that that race doesn't matter whatsoever this is why I'm kind of glad the Republican lost I mean look at the second it could win it could really run again in in November there's a chance that they're both in Congress and in next year yeah what it is reminding us is that we have to vote in November it underscores the buckley rule the buckley rule which is that you should always vote for the most right viable candidate and this should serve as a lesson a final lesson I hope I know it won't be but I wish it were two Republicans who don't vote for Republicans because they would have preferred a better candidate what do they prefer a better candidate listen to that rule most right viable candidate you look if if someone is running who is utterly unacceptable meaning he isn't really right-wing he's just lying or he's like an evil person he's just like a truly depraved satanic figure I guess you know if it's if like we're an Joseph kerbals or something I guess you don't want to elect him bro a vote for the Democrat let the kiddies get extra health care but short of that and there's a lot of political hyperbole but that's not what we're seeing we're not seeing that from congressional candidates we're asking they're from presidential candidates vote for the most right viable candidate you hear this empty slogan sometimes they say people especially who oppose Trump but who oppose other Republicans to you here at every election cycle they've been doing this since Goldwater they say I'm a lifelong Republican but I just couldn't vote for Mitt Romney for some reason or I God couldn't vote for John McCain he's - I don't know he's to moderate really is what he is they country over party some a lot of Republicans say this that doesn't mean anything the reason you join a political party is because you think that that party's vision and a policy platform will better the country that it's better for the country if you think that the other party's vision and platform is better for the country that doesn't mean you're choosing country over party it means you're switching parties I means you're in a different party now that's all it means there there isn't logically a difference between the country and the party if you're in the party you can criticize your own party even you can criticize your own country there neither of those things are perfect but it's a totally empty slogan and what it really means is I don't like this candidate I'm taking my bowling going home when when when well don't do that we need to we need to win things are more important than you know your feelings about some candidate in Pennsylvania or whatever we have to there are more important things on the line economic growth or status on the world stage the world order the lives of the unborn cultural issues the executive agency is taking too much power and controlling your lives unfunded liabilities on and on and on and on and on those things matter your feel like oh I don't like that guy I don't like his haircut well get over it now we have to talk about United Airlines do we have to we had a little bit of time this I know this is an unpopular opinion I don't care United Airlines is under fire again this time for informing a passenger that she couldn't block the aisle with a crate carrying her 10 month old puppy so the stewardess informed her that she would have to put the dog in a box in the overhead bin where sadly it died it's not a good idea to do that I think the dog was a French Bulldog which is sad because I really like those dogs its name was coquito the reason I'm bringing up that it's a French Bulldog is that Bulldogs and pugs and other flatnose dogs have difficulty breathing to begin with and this problem is exacerbated when they're stuffed and overhead bins it's also exacerbated when they're just in at really high altitudes that it's very it's hard for dogs to breathe on the street in New York much less at 30,000 feet this is entirely the dog owners fault entirely the dog owners fault loathe as I am to defend United Airlines people stop bringing your dogs everywhere stop it they don't belong on airplanes they don't belong in restaurants Fifi will survive an hour or two without you if you are not blind leave the dog at home some people need service animals they need them like blind people for instance good bring that dog wherever you want it can be wherever I don't that's fuck that's good people abuse this privilege all at the time especially in LA I see it everywhere these little actress girls bring their dogs bring Fifi onto airplanes and into restaurants as emotional support animals emotional support I know a lot of actresses they all need a lot of emotional support I'm not denying that Fifi ain't gonna suffice I promise you this owner was incredibly irresponsible and incredibly rude to begin don't bring your dog on a flight don't bring your dog on a flight if you are going away for a week put it in a kennel or leave it with a friend if you're going away for months and months and you insist on bringing your dog on vacation to your vacation house fly private if you have all these vacation houses fly private you can afford it my sleep on the LA to New York red-eye is so much more important than Fifi's vacation it boggles the mind do not bring your dog on the flight and certainly don't bring it in the main cabin in the old days in they would go to cargo they have in the old in the glory days before like five minutes ago you put the dog in cargo and then sometimes the dog would die and that was sad so now they bring them into the main cabin beyond that if you insist so if you I know times change culture decays if you insist on bringing Fifi on the flight by Fifi a seat don't just pay that like $3.00 bump up fee so that you can bring the dog in a crate but if the crates too big and you got to put it in the aisle and then it can't be in the aisle so you got to put it in the thing and then it dies by Fifi a seat I know air travel is expensive that's why air travel has traditionally been reserved for people rather than animals because animals don't make a lot of money people make money paying the extra fee doesn't mean you get to put it in the aisle you do not get to block the aisle with your dog crate if God forbid anything happens on that flight I am NOT going to have Fifi be the reason that I do not make it to the raft more importantly the aisle is not for puppy crates the aisle is for drink carts my access to overpriced mediocre scotch on those cylindrical ice cubes with the little hole in them that are very delicious that is much much more important than Fifi's vacation also if you were going to violate every rule of polite society and bring a non-service dog on an airplane why would you bring a ten month old puppy who can barely breathe to begin with on the flight ten month old puppies are very fragile especially when they can barely breathe and you're supposed to be careful with them and why would you bring it on United Airlines did you see what United Airlines did to that doctor just kill me give me give me just give me me me that's how United Airlines treats a human doctor not just a dog not even just a human a doctor that's what they do to a doctor just kill me just kill me dragging him clubbing him on the head did this owner really think that they were going to allow a 10 month old puppy in a crate to block the aisle on the airplane now who cares about all this no I it's kind of a it's a sad story it's it would make some points I really drives me insane with dogs bark on my flights I really really don't like that but why who cares about all this generally it's because we live in a culture that values animals more than people just look at PETA and Planned Parenthood two of the most important nonprofit organizations that raise a ton of money they have a ton of members they the two most important nonprofits on the Left exist just save animals and kill humans that's what they do yeah that's because we don't have a coherent world framework anymore we don't have a coherent world framework we don't know what we're here for the difference between humans and animals and different animals and what the purpose is and it's just you know if it feels good do it and we're all gonna become warm food and that's basically it right since its Lent I get questions about what books I reading and what books other people should be reading to kind of think put yourself in the Lenten penitential spirit to get ready before Easter walked with our Lord 40 days before before Easter so I'll just recommend a few first the book that we're all reading here and rereading here at the Daily wire is after virtue by Alistair McIntyre week drew stalked abetted on a little a little bit on the show I think been his reference did I have we're all kind of reading and rereading it right now check it out it's called after virtue by Alistair McIntyre and then we can all tweet about it and it'll be fun a few more books for Lent if you're agnostic or in a period of spiritual doubt read mere christianity by CS lewis it doesn't get much better than that also what's great after that also by CS lewis are the abolition of man on the weight of glory if you've already gone through lewis it's time to move on to Chesterton everlasting man is good but orthodoxy is better Chesterton is just like a fatter boozy ER smokier more cat like CS Lewis and CS Lewis talks about how he takes quite a lot from Chesterton to finally you can join me in reading Hilaire Belloc the great heresies which I have just just begun wherein Belloc takes on the Arian heresy the great and enduring heresy of Muhammad the Alba Jensen attack what was the Reformation and the modern phase a bellick is an inimitable writer he's like even more Chesterton than Chesterton so that's a great one too ok I think we've covered it the kids the Democrats the dead puppies and the great and enduring heresies that's our show for today if you get your mailbag questions in do it now so that we can answer them for tomorrow and I will see you then I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Nolt show the Michael Dole show is a daily wire forward publishing production executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey
