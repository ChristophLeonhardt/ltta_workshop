all right joining us now member of the Armed Services and Judiciary Committee's Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Senator a lot of people in your state read the New York Post in the Daily News the New York Post as we've shown over the past couple hours you've got a very conservative paper just saying that Donald Trump's idea to arm teachers is a half-cocked idea in Smith and lesson and then there's an editorial a strong editorial on the inside actually talking about banning assault style weapons I'm wondering though we certainly you know as well as anybody the debate after Newtown led to nothing what what can we do that has a chance of passing a Republican House a Republican Senate and getting the president's signature well first half-cock harebrained really toxic lunacy is the way to describe the idea of arming 10 to 40 percent of all the teachers in this country there are 3.5 million teachers that means 700,000 of them are going to be packing heat in their classrooms what kind of message does that send to students and what kind of real prevention does it provide it provides no deterrence because many of these deeply disturbed individuals are suicidal and they expect to die in these horrendous tragic shootings but what can we expect I'm going to be fighting for real reform not the baby steps alone that President Trump has proposed the idea of fixing the Knicks the background check system with better information is fine but it needs to be extended to all purchases the idea of regulation of bump stocks is a very difficult proposition because it has to be done by legislation not by the regulation that President Trump has proposed the ATF has said it has no authority to do it under current statute so we need that legislation I'm going to be fighting for it but also a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and extreme risk orders that in taking guns away from dangerous people that's the key here and that's what I think realistically we have a chance of achieving step-by-step not with the baby steps that President Trump is proposing but the giant strides that I think is demanding Casey Casey senator good morning some of my sources had indicated that it's possible the Judiciary Committee is moving more quickly on this fix Nick's legislation perhaps trying to move as early as next week I'm wondering if that's your understanding considering you sit on that committee and I'm also wondering if you think that you and also members of your party would be willing to support that more limited fix Nick's bill even if it doesn't go into some of the broader reforms that you were just discussing I'm a major leading co-sponsor of the fix Nick's bill it's a fine idea and I'm gonna be pushing for it on the Judiciary Committee this week I'm very hopeful that we can approve it the senator Cornyn who is one of our co-sponsors is a leading member of that committee I think it's a prime candidate for action I think it will attract a lot of support but it ought not to be the limit of what we do there is much more that is necessary and it has to include mental health this administration has proposed cutting funding for mental health it has to include school security this administration has proposed cutting funding for school security those are the places that the resources ought to be devoted yummy Sh senator when when the Democrats had all the power in Washington they also did not pass sweeping gun legislation why did it happen and could you tell me a little bit about how you see if there is something to be passed how that could actually happen under this presidency the White has to tell me that the president will provide political cover for people who backed legislation second question first there is a new sense of building out outcry and outrage that's driven by the images of these young people in the streets and state capitals it's sustained by a network for the first time we have real political infrastructure in groups like town for gun safety and moms demand action and Sandy Hook promise and Newtown action lines the same kind of infrastructure that the NRA has so I think those kinds of developments will help break the wall of resistance and create cracks in the ice of indifference that we've seen all too often in past years it may not happen during this session in fact a betting person would have to say the odds are against it but the key here is elections and the test will be candidates rejecting the blood tainted money of the NRA and Donald Trump really proposing meaningful reforms and I think there is a chance we can do it but the turning point I think and the tipping point will be the next elections Senator Richard Blumenthal thank you very much for being on the show
