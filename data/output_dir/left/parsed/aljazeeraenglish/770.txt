it was a Requiem fit for a queen
paying tribute were a score of political
civil rights and Hollywood luminaries
R&B royalty a political runner-up in a
one time head of state all came to
remember and pay their respects to
Aretha Franklin the Queen of Soul I
think that the secret of her greatness
what she took this massive talent and
this perfect culture that racer and
decided to be the composer of her own
life song what a song it turned out to
be outside stood a line of pink
Cadillacs a tribute to the car and
Aretha's freeway of love
perhaps the luckiest people here are the
members of the general public more than
a thousand of them who found out in the
last minute they would get a chance to
come in to see the Queen these are the
people wearing the white wristbands
thank you to get one last chance to see
the Queen of Soul
one after another the speakers and
performers paid tribute
she was a preacher's daughter raised by
a single parent she had two sons by the
age of 15 and got her start in her
father's choir with the people of the
Motor City remember a legend who always
stayed true to her hometown
