3
00:00:09,526 --> 00:00:11,295
SPECULATION THAT FORMER FBI

4
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:12,162
DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY COULD

5
00:00:12,162 --> 00:00:13,864
FIND HIMSELF IN HOT WATER

6
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:15,599
LEGALLY FOLLOWING THE

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,900

THE DOCUMENT IS SET TO BE

00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,777
RELEASED ON THURSDAY OF THIS

14
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:27,077
WEEK.

15
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:31,448
REPORTEDLY USES THE WORD

16
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,149
"INSUBORDINATE" TO DESCRIBE

17
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:33,250
JAMES COMEY'S BEHAVIOR

18
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,418
DURING HIS TIME AT THE FBI.

19
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:36,119
HERE IS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

20
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:36,920
ATTORNEY RUDY GIULIANI JUST

21
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,123
YESTERDAY.

22
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,458
>> FIRST THING WE ARE GOING

23
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,626
TO GET IS A REPORT FROM

24
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,061
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S HOROWITZ

25
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:45,262
ON COMEY'S HAND LINKS OF

26
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:46,296
HILLARY WHICH I THINK IS

27
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,265
GOING TO BE VERY, VERY

28
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:49,433
CRITICAL AS IT SHOULD BE.

29
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:51,401
COMEY REALLY, HAS A CHANCE

30
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:52,569
OF BEING PROSECUTED AS A

31
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:56,740
RESULT OF IT, BUT WE'LL SEE.

32
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,307
>> Harris: COMEY HAS

33
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,208
PREVIOUSLY DEFENDED HIS HAND

34
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,509
LINKS OF THE EMAIL PROBE BY

35
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:00,877
SAYING HE MADE THE BEST

36
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:01,979
DECISIONS POSSIBLE GIVEN THE

37
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:02,346
SITUATION.

38
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:04,114
LET'S BRING IN ALAN

39
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:05,549
DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW

40
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:06,683
PROFESSOR EMERITUS AND

41
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:08,485
AUTHOR OF THE BOOK "THE CASE

42
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,654
AGAINST IMPEACHING TRUMP."

43
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:11,555
ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU.

44
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:13,857
SO, TALK TO ME ABOUT REBECCA

45
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:14,758
GOMEZ AND JAMES COMEY.

46
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:16,927
IS

47
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:17,995
GOMEZ -- RUDY GIULIANI AND

48
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:18,562
JAMES COMEY?

49
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:19,963
IS HE RIGHT HE COULD FIND

50
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:22,099
HIMSELF IN LEGAL TROUBLE.

51
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:23,834
>> RUDY IS A GREAT FRIEND OF

52
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,003
MINE AND A GREAT LAWYER I

53
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,104
DISAGREE WITH CRIMINALIZE

54
00:01:27,104 --> 00:01:28,038
POLITICAL DIFFERENCES IN

55
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:28,639
THIS CONTEXT.

56
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:29,906
I HAVE BEEN A LONG-TIME

57
00:01:29,906 --> 00:01:31,308
OPPONENT OF TRYING TO

58
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:32,809
CRIMINALIZE POLITICAL

59
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:33,510
DIFFERENCES BY DONALD TRUMP

60
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,779
AND BY PEOPLE IN THE TRUMP

61
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:36,246
ADMINISTRATION.

62
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:37,180
AND NOW THAT THE SHOE IS ON

63
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,982
THE OTHER FOOT, I TAKE THE

64
00:01:38,982 --> 00:01:40,183
SAME POSITION.

65
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,752
LET'S NOT TURN DISAGREEMENTS

66
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:42,452
INTO CRIMES.

67
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:45,489
EVEN IF HE ACTED

68
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:46,156
INSUBORDINATELY, THAT'S NOT

69
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:46,690
A CRIME.

70
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,725
AND WE HAVE TO START

71
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:49,826
DISARMING BOTH SIDES AND

72
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:50,994
STOP WEAPONIZING THE

73
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:52,763
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND

74
00:01:52,763 --> 00:01:54,998
USING IT AGAINST POLITICAL

75
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:55,365
OPPONENTS.

76
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,501
SO, I HOPE THAT IF IS HE

77
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:58,101
CRITICIZED, THAT'S FINE.

78
00:01:58,101 --> 00:02:00,137
IN THE MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS.

79
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:01,571
BUT, LET'S NOT TURN

80
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:02,472
CRITICISM INTO

81
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:03,840
CRIMINALIZATION ON EITHER

82
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,207
SIDE.

83
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:04,775
>> Harris: ALL RIGHT.

84
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:06,009
SO THAT'S RUDY GIULIANI'S

85
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:08,078
TAKE ON IT BUT, LET'S TAKE A

86
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:09,979
LOOK AND HEAR FROM BOB

87
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,248
GOODLATTE ON THE SAME TOPIC

88
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:12,883
BECAUSE WHAT HE IS SAYING IS

89
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,051
IF IT DOES PROGRESS TO THE

90
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,285
POINT WHERE COMEY OR ANYBODY

91
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:16,453
ELSE COMING OUT OF THE

92
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:21,391
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT

93
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,592
NEEDS FURTHER LITIGATION OR

94
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,560
PROSECUTION, THIS IS WHAT HE

95
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:23,860
SEES.

96
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,862
>> I THINK AND MANY OTHERS

97
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:26,763
IN THE CONGRESS CONTINUE TO

98
00:02:26,763 --> 00:02:28,598
THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

99
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:29,733
AN INDEPENDENT SPECIAL

100
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,634
COUNSEL SEPARATE AND APART

101
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:32,602
FROM THE WORK THAT

102
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:33,336
MR. MUELLER IS DOING.

103
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:33,670
>> YEAH.

104
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,872
>> TO HANDLE THESE POTENTIAL

105
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:36,640
CRIMINAL REFERRALS AND TO

106
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,275
LOOK INTO THIS MATTER FOR

107
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:41,845
THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING

108
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:43,046
FURTHER MATTERS BEYOND WHAT

109
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:45,248
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL DOES.

110
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,616
>> Harris: SO, ALLEN, WHAT I

111
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:48,618
HEAR CONGRESSMAN GOODLATTE

112
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:51,021
SAYING THERE IS LET'S HAVE

113
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:52,389
SOMEBODY TAKE A LOOK AT THIS

114
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:53,023
SO CAN YOU SEE WHETHER OR

115
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:54,091
NOT IT'S SIMPLY POLITICS.

116
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,192
>> WELL, THAT'S WHAT THE

117
00:02:55,192 --> 00:02:56,393
INSPECTOR GENERAL IS DOING.

118
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:57,894
BUT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK

119
00:02:57,894 --> 00:02:58,862
TWO WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT.

120
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:00,363
I THINK IT WAS WRONG TO

121
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:01,865
APPOINT A SPECIAL COUNSEL TO

122
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:02,399
INVESTIGATE TRUMP.

123
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:03,767
I THINK IT'S EQUALLY WRONG

124
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,236
TO APPOINT A SPECIAL COUNSEL

125
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:07,270
TO INVESTIGATE COMEY.

126
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,540
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY THINKS

127
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:10,907
THAT.

128
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:11,575
>> Harris: EVEN THOUGH WE

129
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:12,375
KNOW HE HAS LEAKED

130
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:12,776
INFORMATION.

131
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:13,643
WE KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS

132
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:14,644
THAT JAMES COMEY HAS DONE.

133
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:15,912
AND BY THE WAY, POLITICALLY,

134
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:17,414
IS HE NOT MAKING EITHER SIDE

135
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:18,515
OF THE POLITICAL AISLE

136
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:18,815
HAPPY.

137
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:19,950
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT

138
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,250
THAT.

139
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,952
BUT, YOU DON'T TURN

140
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:26,123
POLITICAL OPPOSITION INTO

141
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:26,590
CRIMINALIZATION.

142
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,491
LEAK SOMETHING NOT A CRIME

143
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,592
UNLESS IT'S LEAKING OF A

144
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:29,826
GRAND JURY MATERIAL.

145
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:31,061
LET'S UNDERSTAND THAT THERE

146
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:31,895
ARE CRIMINAL STATUTES AND

147
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:33,897
THEY SHOULD BE DEFINED

148
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:35,699
NARROWLY AND WE SHOULDN'T BE

149
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:36,867
WEAPONIZING THE CRIMINAL

150
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:38,168
JUSTICE SYSTEM AGAINST

151
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:39,035
EITHER SIDE.

152
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:41,905
I WAS CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT

153
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:42,439
TRUMP.

154
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:42,906
>> Harris: OKAY.

155
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:44,274
>> WHEN HE CALLED FOR LOCKER

156
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:45,308
UP TO HILLARY CLINTON OR

157
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,610
LET'S HAVE A SPECIAL COUNSEL

158
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,511
TO HILLARY CLINTON.

159
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:48,345
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT

160
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:50,447
HE THINKS SPECIAL COUNSEL

161
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:51,148
ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

162
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,382
I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT BUT,

163
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:53,917
IF HE THINKS THEY ARE

164
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:54,751
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS TO HIM,

165
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,620
THEY ARE SURELY

166
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,287
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS WELL AS

167
00:03:57,287 --> 00:03:59,456
TO COMEY OR AS TO ANYBODY

168
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:01,758
ELSE WE HAVE TO HAVE NEUTRAL

169
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:02,159
PRINCIPLES.

170
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,960
THE SAME PRINCIPLES.

171
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,528
>> Harris: ALL RIGHT.

172
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:05,996
>> PEOPLE CONFUSE MY

173
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:06,363
ADVOCACY.

174
00:04:06,363 --> 00:04:07,764
I'M NOT THERE AS ADVOCATE

175
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:08,398
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.

176
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:14,538
I'M AN ADVOCATE TO CIVIL

177
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:16,273
LIBERTIES.

178
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:16,940
>> Harris: ALLEN, I'M GOING

179
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,108
TO LOSE YOU AND I'M WHAT WE

180
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:20,209
KNOW TO BE TRUE OF EAFLTIONS

181
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,978
OF BIAS INSIDE THE FBI.

182
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:23,246
WE HAD TEXT MESSAGES FLOWING

183
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:25,315
BETWEEN AT LEAST TWO

184
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:26,349
EMPLOYEES THAT WE KNOW ABOUT

185
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,317
WHO WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR.

186
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:28,552
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

187
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:29,252
>> Harris: WHO HE WOULD LIKE

188
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:29,886
TO PRESS AGAINST THIS

189
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:31,154
PRESIDENT AND WAS THERE BIAS

190
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:31,788
INSIDE THE FBI?

191
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:32,589
I MEAN, THE INSPECTOR

192
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:33,790
GENERAL IS LOOKING AT A

193
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,258

00:04:37,227 --> 00:04:38,562
THOSE ARE APPROPRIATE

196
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:41,064

SPECIAL COUNSEL.

206
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:52,475
>> Harris: WE KNOW THAT HE

207
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:54,077
CAN'T PROSECUTE, SO IF THERE

208
00:04:54,077 --> 00:04:55,178
ARE SIGNS OF BIAS --

209
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:56,580
>> -- HE CAN'T PROSECUTE BUT

210
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,380
HE COULD RECOMMEND

211
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,315
PROSECUTION, BUT HE HAS TO

212
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:00,217
SHOW THAT THERE IS AN AL

213
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,151
ACTUAL CRIME COMMITTED AND

214
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:01,952
THAT CRIME WOULD BE

215
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:02,752
PROSECUTED WHETHER IT WAS

216
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:03,987
DONE BY A DEMOCRAT OR

217
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:04,921
REPUBLICAN OR AN

218
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:05,322

00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:06,923
WE HAVE TO HAVE ONE STANDARD

220
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:08,425
OF JUSTICE FOR ALL AND WE

221
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:10,227
HAVE TO USE THE CRIMINAL LAW

222
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,429
ONLY AS A LAST RESORT WHEN

223
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:14,865
THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE YARD

224
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:17,033
THAT AN EXISTING STATUTORY

225
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,134
CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED.

226
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:19,703
I DON'T THINK THAT STANDARD

227
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:21,238
HAS BEEN MET.

228
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:21,838

WHOLE LOT LATER THIS WEEK.
