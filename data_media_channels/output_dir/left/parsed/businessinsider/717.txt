I think we've seen this movie before I
think it's reaching the point where it's
of Watergate size and in the scale and a
couple of other scandals that you and I
have seen
three words obstruction of justice
telling the FBI director to close down
an investigation of your senior campaign
advisor for his activities during your
campaign for president if that's true
that is obstruction of justice its of
Watergate size and scale and a couple of
other scandals that you and I have seen
it's a centipede that the shoe continues
to drop and every couple of days there's
a new aspect of this really unhappy
situation and you know my friends are
none of us no matter what our political
leanings are no matter how we feel about
Trump feel this is not good for America
you
