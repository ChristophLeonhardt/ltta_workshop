it was no not surreal it was I can remember and it was a 72 hour period of time there that was quite quite intense but as we went up to the point of bin Laden's take down and I must say that the the minute seemed like it seemed like hours it went on and on and even after knew that seemed like the raid was successful waiting for our forces that carried out that raid to get out of Pakistani airspace safely because it was a fair distance that had to travel we were just it was white knuckles because you always want to be able to you know succeed in your mission but you also want to make sure that the people who are undertaking these great risks and doing it are going to come home safely and I think it just shows just how tremendously skilled a US military is in terms of doing these things so clearly that was a very proud moment
