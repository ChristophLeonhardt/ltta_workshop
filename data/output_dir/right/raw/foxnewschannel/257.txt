1
00:00:02,484 --> 00:00:04,585
MODEST CRITICISM FROM SOME OF

2
00:00:04,586 --> 00:00:05,385
HER DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS.

3
00:00:05,386 --> 00:00:06,653
>> Martha: THE KIND OF

4
00:00:06,654 --> 00:00:08,055
BEHAVIOR THAT YOU WERE JUST

5
00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:09,456
DISCUSSING IS WHAT JEFF FLAKE IS

6
00:00:09,457 --> 00:00:11,291
SPEAKING OUT ABOUT TONIGHT,

7
00:00:11,292 --> 00:00:15,062
SAYING THAT THAT'S WHY HE HOPES

8
00:00:15,063 --> 00:00:18,165
SOMEBODY IN THE NEXT ELECTION

9
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,433
RUNS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT.

10
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:21,668
>> I DO HOPE THAT SOMEBODY DOES

11
00:00:21,669 --> 00:00:23,103
RUN IN THE PRIMARY AGAINST THE

12
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:23,470
PRESIDENT.

13
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:25,339
I THINK THE REPUBLICANS NEED TO

14
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,241
BE REMINDED ON WHAT CONSERVATISM

15
00:00:27,242 --> 00:00:28,842
IT REALLY IS.

16
00:00:28,843 --> 00:00:32,446
AND, WHAT IT MEANS TO BE DECENT.

17
00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:34,815
WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT KIND OF

18
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,282
POLITICS LATELY.

19
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:37,684
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK, AND IT DO

20
00:00:37,685 --> 00:00:39,853
YOU THINK IS RIGHT?

21
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:41,655
>> JEFF FLAKE IS A FAILED

22
00:00:41,656 --> 00:00:42,990
POLITICIAN, HE HAS 18% APPROVAL

23
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:45,325
RATING IN HIS HOME STATE LAST I

24
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:45,859
CHECKED.

25
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,661
I DON'T KNOW WHAT JEFF FLAKE IS

26
00:00:47,662 --> 00:00:51,265
TALKING ABOUT, LIKE 92% OF

27
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:52,699
REPUBLICANS ARE SUPPORTIVE OF

28
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,867
THE PRESIDENT.

29
00:00:53,868 --> 00:00:55,903
SO JEFF FLAKE IS LIKE THE

30
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:57,471
STANDARD BEARER FOR

31
00:00:57,472 --> 00:00:58,839
CONSERVATIVISM, AND DONALD TRUMP

32
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,139
ISN'T.

33
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,175
THAT MEANS THE WHOLE PARTY IS A

34
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:01,675
FRAUD.

35
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:03,110
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CONSTITUENCY

36
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:04,111
HE THINKS HE REPRESENTS BUT I

37
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:07,848
WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE PLAN FOR A

38
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:09,850
GDP RATE HIGHER THAN 4%, SOMEONE

39
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:11,552
WHO COULD HAVE FIGURED OUT NAFTA

40
00:01:11,553 --> 00:01:14,521
FASTER OR PUT CHINA BACK ON

41
00:01:14,522 --> 00:01:17,024
THEIR HEELS FASTER BUT I THINK

42
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:18,258
JEFF FLAKE LOOKS TO JOIN AN

43
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:19,226
INVESTMENT BANK OR SOMETHING AND

44
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:20,627
MAYBE THAT WILL BE MORE POPULAR

45
00:01:20,628 --> 00:01:20,928
THERE.

46
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:23,163
HE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF A FUTURE

47
00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:24,264
AS A POLITICAL PUNDIT.

48
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:26,066
>> YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT NUMBERS

49
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:27,100
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGOT ABOUT

50
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:29,636
THAT AND ALL OF HIS SPEAKING

51
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:29,903
OUT.

52
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:33,507
>> MARTHA, YOU ARE BEING NICE.

53
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:35,242
HE HATES TRUMP.

54
00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:36,243
OKAY?

55
00:01:36,244 --> 00:01:37,878
>> Martha: ABSOLUTELY.

56
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,713
>> HE DESPISES DONALD TRUMP SO

57
00:01:39,714 --> 00:00:00,000
JEFF FLAKE WANT SOMEONE TO RUN
