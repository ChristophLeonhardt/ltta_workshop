big news over the weekend and the big news today is the situation in Syria so over the last few days the dictator of Syria used chemical weapons against his own citizens once again and the footage broke on TV now as you recall the last time there was a public use of chemical weapons and the news broke on TV president Trump lobbed a couple of missiles into Syria it is something like 50 missiles were lobbed into Syria and in a particular airbase was hit well it's unclear what exactly the United States is going to do as of yet but all the action has been taken it's been taken by Israel so Israel went in and and knocked out a Syrian Air Base and took down some of their Syrian air defenses and I'll give you all that information in just a second for those who don't know what Syrian chemical weapons attacks look like they are just horrendous and horrific the footage looked something like this so you can see these children are you know being treated they're being washed off with water because they've all been doused with chemical weapons a lot of these a lot of these folks are have died of suffocation some of the 100 people died of suffocation and the I mean these are children these are small children so obviously we see images like this it's absolutely horrific Israel lashed out yesterday so here's the story from The Associated Press Russia and the Syrian military have blamed Israel for a pre-dawn missile attack Monday on a Syrian Air Base that reportedly killed 14 people including through iranian x' while international condemnation grew over a suspected poison gas attack over the weekend that was said to be carried out by the Syrian government opposition activists said 40 people died in the chemical attack blaming President Bashar Assad's forces the UN Security Council plans to hold an emergency meeting Monday to discuss the chemical attack well whoop-dee-do with the UN Security Council Russia sits on the UN Security Council Russia is the great sponsors state of the Syrian regime so nothing is going to happen in the UN Security Council we should put all of our money from that awful institution if you want know how terrible the UN is understand that Syria is about to sit on the committee for the regulation of chemical and biological weapons no that is not a joke that is a real actual thing so before you start thinking that the UN is gonna step in and solve anything at all recognize that the UN is a gigantic joke and that is why it's up to sovereign states to do something about these sort of atrocities the timing of the strike on the airbase in the central homs province hours after President Trump said there would be a big price to pay for the chemical weapons attack raised questions about whether Israel is acting alone or as a proxy for the United States Israel typically does not comment on its airstrikes in Syria it was the second such attack this year on the air base the air base is known as t4 and it's where Iranian fighters are believed to be stationed according to Russia's Defense Ministry two Israeli aircraft targeted the t4 Air Base firing eight missiles it said Syria shot down five of them the other three landed in the West part of the base syrian state TV quoted an unnamed military official saying that israeli f-15 were planes fired several missiles at t4 and it gave no further details and of course israel's foreign ministry said nothing since 2012 israel has struck inside syria more than 100 times mostly targeting suspected weapons convoys destined for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah which has been fighting along Syrian governmental forces so this looks like this could be the prelude to larger action John McCain and one of the people Senator McCain has been pushing for a larger action in Syria for a long time he's wanted to topple the Syrian regime for years and years and he suggested that we armed Syrian rebels one of the problems with that at the time as he wasn't clear who the Syrian rebels actually were were they all kind gentle nice people were some of them associated with terrorist groups the way that some of the people we armed in Libya were that was unclear at the time it led to a lot of Republican pushback here's what Senator McCain had to say he said President Trump last week signal to the world that the United States would prematurely withdraw from Syria we never chance to talk about this last week but Trump did say he wanted to withdraw from Syria and immediately within days Bashar Assad was using chemical weapons on his own citizens that's why President Trump's rhetoric actually matters and to pretend otherwise is foolish McCain continues Bashar Assad and his Russian and Iranian backers have heard him and emboldened by American inaction Assad has reportedly launched another chemical attack against innocent men women and children this time in Duma initial accounts show dozens of innocent civilians including children have been targeted by this vicious bombardment designed to burn and choke the human body and leave victims writhing in unspeakable pain crimes against humanity who become Assad's trademarks in his relentless campaign against the people of Syria that has killed more than half a million people enforced 11 million people from their homes according to John McCain president Trump was quick to call out Assad today along with the Russian and Iranian government's on Twitter the question now is whether he will do anything about it the president responded decisively when Assad used chemical weapons last year he should do so again and demonstrate that Assad will pay a price for his war crimes to be sure president Trump inherited bad options after years of in actions by his predecessor in Syria history will render a bitter judgment on America for that failure but no one should believe that we are out of options we can and should change course starting with a comprehensive strategy that lays out clear objectives for our mission there well that is the big question is what are the objectives going to be for the mission there because a foreign policy isolationist people like Ann Coulter or Rand Paul they would say we have no interest in Syria whatsoever so terrible things are happening there awful humanitarian crisis but humanitarian crises are happening all over the world that is not the job of the United States to stop every humanitarian crisis it all depends on the sort of blood and treasure America will have to expend in order to stop those humanitarian crises well that's obviously true we have to calculate each individual situation on its own but the situation on Syria has fundamentally changed in the several years since President Obama allowed Bashar Assad to get away with his chemical weapons attack here's what President Trump tweeted after all of the after the chemical weapons attack he tweeted quote many dead including women and children and mindless chemical attack in Syria area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian army making it completely inaccessible to outside world President Putin Russia and Iran are responsible for backing animal Assad so he's now have gotten a nickname for Assad which is entirely appropriate in this case big price and continued big price to pay open area immediately for medical help and verification another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever sick ok all of that is true the question becomes okay what is going to happen next well Trump's national security adviser while his security advisors rather Tombaugh surd's he was on national TV on Sunday and he said listen all the options are on the table here one of those issues on which every nation all peoples have all agreed and have agreed since World War two is an unacceptable practice so well they there will be another missile attack yeah I wouldn't take anything off the table these are horrible photos we're looking into the attack at this point the State Department put out a statement last night and the president senior national security cabinet had been talking with him and with each other all throughout the evening and this morning and myself included so one of the things that's amazing about all of this is that people on the Left are already critical of Trump Trump inherited an awful situation here Tommy Vietor who is just a dolt he used to drive a van for Obama then suddenly ended up as a National Security Council or for President Obama after driving a van and now I guess that he is and now I guess that he is doing pod save America type stuff well he tweeted out that President Trump inherited a bad situation well Tommy who did he inherit that from weren't you there I mean all you were there at the time now there were those of us who opposed President Obama's quote-unquote pinpricks strike in Syria the reason being that if you send a missile into Syria and then you do nothing else you actually embolden the Iranians and you emboldened the Syrians and you in the Russians nobody expected that President Obama was going to give away the store to the Russians if recall back to 2013 Bashar Assad used chemical weapons Barack Obama then drew a red line in the sand here is President Obama back then drawing the red line we have been very clear to the Assad regime but also to other players on the ground that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized that would change my calculus that would change my equation okay so he made that statement actually in August of 2012 then of course Bashar Assad immediately used chemical weapons like within a couple of months and then Barack Obama did something really unexpected first he said maybe I'll maybe I'll throw a missile in there but you know what I need congressional approval now that was obviously a lie because he didn't have congressional approval for his Libya action he just went ahead and did it but he he said I'll throw it to Congress and that went nowhere and then he said you know what I'll let the Russians take over the Russians can come in and they will disarm this year in so Barack Obama and Susan Rice both came out Susan Rice then the national security adviser she came out and she said don't worry Syria's chemical weapons have been removed they're gone Syria has no more chemical weapons ready the Obama was triumphalist about this he said everything is better there will be no more chemical chemical weapons attacks everything is under control here is Barack Obama and Susan Rice this is back in 2013 we've done these last eight years without firing a shot we've eliminated Syria's declared chemical weapons program all of these steps have helped to keep us safe and helped to keep our troops safe those are the result of diplomacy we don't have strong efforts there the more you will be called upon to clean up after the failure of diplomacy we were able to find a solution that actually removed the chemical weapons that were known from Syria in a way that the use of force would never have accomplished okay and Tommy meters have the same thing well you know we got rid of a lot of the chemical weapons right except for the ones that he's using on the civilians and has continued to use on the civilians so well done Susan Rice is amazing all these people who came into the Obama administration proclaiming that it was a new day for American foreign policy and they're gonna act in the humanitarian interest of the people of Syria and then proceeded to allow that entire country to descend into utter and absolute chaos now there's a civil war going on and that wasn't Barack Obama's fault it was Barack Obama's fault that he decided to hand over all of these security concerns to the Russians the Russians obviously had nefarious purposes they're all they care about is propping up Bashar Assad and all of this raises the question which is okay what should the United States do now and that is a serious and open question you know it is amazing again how badly the Obama administration blew it this is not on President Trump but now Trump is the president so that raises a question as to where we go from here in a second I'm going to answer that question for you or at least give you maybe some some concerns that I have about full-scale military intervention as well as some possibilities on what we can do in Syria right now first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at stamps.com so these days you can get practically everything on demand but you still think you

the things that has changed you there are a lot of people like me who back during the Obama administration said this a direct quote in 2013 lobbing missiles into Syria without decapitating the regime strengthens both both Assad and the mullahs in other words whatever you do has to have real impact you can't do what Obama wanted to do and take a half-assed action and then hope that everything is gonna be better that doesn't work you can't hover a hand over power to the Russian government whose only interest is in continued propagation of the domination of Bashar Assad and the continued domination of the Iranian regime across the Middle East and things have changed radically since 2013 it because of a couple of deals that the Obama administration cut remember the situation in 2012-2013 was a lot simpler Russia was not running Syria at that point in Iran was still under American sanction well because of Barack Obama Iran now has a lot of money to play with and they have expanded their terrorism outreach all across the Middle East suddenly there's a swath of territory all the way from Iran to Lebanon that is dominated by Iran that's dominated by ur and that includes Syria this is why Israel was the one that actually struck out yesterday at this at the targets in Syria they've been striking out at targets in Syria as I say over a hundred times they struck at targets in Syria since 2012 because Syria is being used as a thoroughfare for the world's worst weapons being put in the hands of terrorists people like Hamas people like Hezbollah yea glean a MOS is a general retired general in the Israeli Army's the executive director of Tel Aviv University's Institute for national security studies and is a really interesting tweet thread about what happened last night when Israel apparently struck t4 which is in a Syrian air base he said the reported strike last night in T for Syria is part of the two colliding vectors Iranian determination to entrench itself in Syria and Israeli resolve to prevent it this was the first reported air strike since since February 10th incidents the colliding vectors were recognized months ago in the Israeli national security strategy and Syrian and Iranian responses cannot be ruled out this strikes timing drove Syria to first distribute it to the US as a response to Assad's use of chemical weapons against civilians in Duma however the US has denied responsibility while the target hit is connected to Iran and not to and not to chemical weapons it is not from t4a air air force base that the CW dropping aircraft came while reports of Iranian casualties are a strong testament that being said a strike may well serve two purposes promoting two objectives in a single step preventing Iranian and transmen in Syria with advanced weaponry and sending a moral message that using CW to commit mass murder is not acceptable to that end even if it does not take responsibility for the strike last night it is important that Israel make its voice heard denouncing the use of chemical weapons and their use in Syria a way to u.s. and Western response and one cannot rule out the possibility of us strike on regime targets so here's what's happening this has now become a grand strategic game this is no longer a situation in which everything is contained okay that's the reality of the situation in Syria right now this is not a containable situation Russia is involved Iran is involved this is now a proxy war about who is going to control this entire swath of land in the Middle East that means tau D Arabia is involved it means Jordan is involved it means Egypt is involved it means Israel is involved if World War three breaks out in Syria World War three will break out because Barack Obama allowed Syria to become a tinderbox by pulling American troops out of Iraq by allowing Iran to run roughshod through Iraq and by allowing Iran to extend its domination all the way to Lebanon so what exactly should we do and we should do a couple of things if we have the capacity we should knock out as much of the Syrian air force as we possibly can we should knock down as many of their anti-aircraft missiles as we possibly can we should it's probably impossible to decapitate the regime with significant amounts of boots on the ground whatever we can do from the air we should do from the air and we should also ensure that there are safe havens safe havens for Syrian rebels and people who want to escape the Assad regime and those should be protected by a coalition force led by the United States the reason being that there have to be safe spaces for all of these Syrian refugees otherwise they're just going to come into the West otherwise they're just going to escape across the Mediterranean and into Europe or they will come to the United States and that is something that from supporters are not fond of either so the either they're gonna stay there and save places that we helped set up or they will be killed or they will escape but should we go in and make this a full-scale land war probably not probably not because again what's America's interest here America has two real interests chuckin Russian ambitions well three interests okay humanitarian but that exists all across the globe checking Russian interests in Syria Russia wants to ensure the Prashar Assad and the Iranian regime retain power and gain power in that region which makes it more likely the war breaks out and stopping the growth of the Iranian regime Israel in Saudi Arabia by the way are happy to take the lead here right Israel obviously is already taking the lead here is rosin gonna wait so the fact that the United States can mobilize a commitment behind Israeli LED action in Syria would be a good thing if we have allies who are willing to do this there's no reason the United States should have to lead the way but again the u.s. is going to have to be involved that means setting up these these safer places for Syrian refugees to go it means neutering the ability of the Assad regime to use chemical weapons and it means preventing them from making more territorial encroachments into rebel-held areas and that means providing actual armed support to whatever Syrian rebels are left who have not been murdered already by Isis and the Assad regime and arming those people who are left in order to resist the Assad regime this now has implications far beyond the borders of Syria and we are gonna pay a price for it in terms of money and treasure and the possibility of additional terrorism and the spread of chemical weapons if we take a fully hands-off approach as some of the more isolationist members of the Republican Party seem to be seem to be promoting okay well meanwhile there's there's a bunch of other stuff going on among those other things apparently President Trump is intent on launching a trade war the stock market has been up and down basically assuming that you know President Trump is not serious about the trade war or that he is serious about the trade war it's not clear where he is on the trade war but it's interesting to see how many members of the oh how many members of the Trump administration are trying to kind of shift his thinking on trade itself so let's talk a little bit about where he is so a couple of Trump's officials went on TV over the weekend to talk about president Trump's initiation of a trade war against China he obviously has set tariffs extraordinarily high in particular sectors of the economy and there are two takes on tariffs they take number one from the Trump administration on tariffs is that tariffs are a tool that is to be used as often as possible because they're good for the United States we have a trade deficit and the only way to rectify that trade imbalance is to put tariffs on foreign products thereby forcing American citizens to buy American and lowering the amount of money that we are exporting to China for example okay that is idiotic economically for reasons that I've suggested many times on this program okay the reality is the taxing American citizens does not make American citizens more wealthy and all the tariffs is is an indirect tax on American citizens for the benefit of certain American businesses so if there is a CO maker who is less efficient than another steel maker that is located abroad and you are forcing American citizens to patronize the American steel maker you are taking money out of my pocket and giving it to another business that is just a form of redistribution ISM it's a tax-and-spend program that's all a tariff is it's a domestic tax-and-spend program and that does not make America any wealthier now it is another question if you are using trade in order to punish bad regimes for example and we've done that with South Africa in the past we have done that with Iran we did that that's what sanctions were for it was essentially a tariff on on an impossibly high tariff on Iran was essentially what a sanction is in policy right so there's using it for security reasons there's also using it in order to try and job other countries to lower their tariffs so let's say China has a bunch of tariffs on American products and we say listen you lower your tariffs will lower our tariffs but if you're gonna terrify our products we will tariffs yours in our market is bigger than yours alright then that may be worthwhile also now the problem here is that Trump is a devotee of the first kind of thinking the tariffs are universally good a lot of the people who surround him are people who think that tariffs can be strategically useful and I think what they are trying to do inside the Trump administration is manipulate the president into using tariffs as a targeted method of lowering tariffs elsewhere or pushing security change and what Trump actually wants he just likes the tariffs generally so you can see this from some of his officials Steve minuchin is one of them my nutrient came out and he said listen maybe there'll be a trade war but it'll be okay Trump what Trump's officials know better than anybody the people who surround Trump is that there's one word Trump does not hear and that word is know if you say the president Trump know about anything there is a 100% guarantee he will do that thing and does no matter what the thing is literally they told him don't walk into a solar eclipse without your sunglasses and the President of the United States took office and glasses and looked into a solar eclipse because if you tell him no he's got the same reaction and both my kids who are you who are you okay so Steve minuchin and Larry Kudlow both have been avoiding telling him no what they're trying to do instead is I think convince him that it's a qualified no yes mr. president that's brilliant policy but who best if you used it in this particular way so I'll explain what they're doing in just a second first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at wink so you know does all this news stuff make you stressed out it makes me stressed out and that's why at night sometimes you need a glass of wine let's be real

/ Ben and you get that twenty bucks off that also wants to know that we sent you ok so here are the members of the Trump administration trying to convince President Trump that a trade war might not be a bad idea well saying well ok maybe there'll be a trade war because they don't actually want to say no to the president here's steve minuchin the treasury secretary i don't expect there will be a trade war it could be but i don't i don't expect it at all but the president is willing to make sure we are free and fair trade as you've seen his tweet already this morning and again he has a very close relationship with President Xi and will continue to discuss these issues with them okay so he is soft-pedaling it because again if you say no to Trump it is more likely that he launches a trade war on everybody Larry Kudlow sort of doing the same thing he's the new head of the National Economic Council and a free trader he says listen we have to do this but listen to his rationale for why these tariffs are necessary it is not because the tariffs are a great idea just in and of themselves it's because he thinks that they are a useful tool for lowering tariffs elsewhere look we have to do this we have to get China to change its behaviour in two decades and they're still stealing our intellectual property they're still forcing technology turnovers from our businesses to them there's still got high tariffs they still got trade barriers they still have market closing instead of market open so that's got a cage Trump is doing the Lord's work okay so Kudlow is basically saying the tariffs are our point of leverage it's not that tariffs are just wonderfully in a great thing you know president Trump however tends to think that they are a great thing I hope that Kudlow obviously prevails I hope that minuchin prevails I hope that his team allows Trump to recognize the reality about trade which the tariffs can be a useful tool for leveraging things from other people but they're not good innately for the United States of America okay meanwhile in other news late last week I didn't get a chance to comment on it this is an amazing story Jeffrey Goldberg is the editor of the Atlantic Jeffrey Goldberg is also a schmuck so Jeffrey Goldberg is the guy who was essentially a tool of the Obama administration in pushing out there Iran lies every time that a piece of propaganda they went out to Jeffrey Goldberg because Jeffrey Goldberg was there boy Jeffrey Goldberg was the guy who's gonna say what they want well now he's the editor of the Atlantic and a couple of weeks ago a few weeks ago he did something that looked a little more reasonable it looked a little smarter he said he wanted to diversify the opinion pages over at the Atlantic and they hired former National Review columnist Kevin Williamson now Kevin is a real iconoclast Kevin is the kind of guy who says I would say wild things on a regular basis he's a create he's a tremendous writer I mean a really tremendous writer but all of his language is extraordinarily strong he always takes very strong positions some of them on bizarre issues and one of the issues that people had known about for a long time the Kevin had spoken about was that he is not generally in favor of the death penalty he doesn't like the death penalty and he would avoid the death penalty but if the death penalty were to remain applicable in the United States he believes that women should be punished for abortion because of abortion is homicide then women should be punished for it and if women were to be punished for it and the death penalty were still in play then he presumes that women would get the death penalty right he had tweeted about that before and the Atlantic fully knew about this right Jeffrey Goldberg know about it everyone on Twitter knew about this it was one of Williamson's weirder positions now the general pro-life position on this issue is that you wouldn't actually punish the woman afford the abortion you punish the abortion doctors for the abortion because women who are obtaining abortions generally are doing so because they do not have the proper mens rea they don't actually think of it as killing their own baby and so they don't actually know what it is they're doing whereas the doctor full dwell knows what he's doing this has always been the pro-life position in the general pro-life community Williamson takes an even stronger position than that obviously well he tweeted something out about it and then they discovered that on a podcast he talked a little bit about it so here's what it sounded like when Kevin Williamson this this new Atlantic columnist had talked about this on a podcast with with Charlie Cook National Review podcast called mad dogs and Englishmen and someone challenged me on my views abortion you know saying if you really thought it was a crime you would support things like you know life in prison no parole for treating some homicide and I do support that in fact as I wrote what I mind is hanging and Vyasa when I was talking about Yahoo da I would totally go with treating like any other crime up to including hanging okay so what he meant there of course is that as a thought experiment if you were going to have hanging as the legal method of death in all of these various areas Williamson by nature is against the death penalty by the way then he would say that that applies to abortion now so I think that's a good argument now do I do I agree with Williamson no but the Atlantic fired him for this okay then they issued a statement talking about how his views were essentially unacceptable here is what Goldberg said quote the language he used in this podcast and in my conversations with him in recent days made it clear that the original tweet did in fact represent his carefully considered views okay well you didn't know that like he had said that it was known it was on his Twitter account and I assume that Jeffrey Goldberg had called him up about it and go it said do you believe this and William said yeah I believe this well as the editor of the website one of the things that we do is we hire a bunch of people with widely disparate views they're all on the right because I am the editor of the website and it's a right-wing website it's conservative website over at Daily wire if people hold opinions like pro-choice opinions for example they do not appear on our website there may be pro-choice writers right for us I really don't know but I can edit what goes on my website well the Atlantic certainly could have done the same thing with Williamson if they don't like this particular opinion he said listen I would write a long article about why hanging is the proper response to abortion and the in the Atlantic listen we don't want that in our pages that's their prerogative but firing him preemptively for a thought crime for a view that he had not expressed in the pages of the Atlantic is a pretty amazing thing and Williamson has a lot of very strong positions and what this really is is that the Left believes that any right winger it wouldn't matter it wouldn't matter for Williamson or Bret Stevens or me or Ross dude hat it does not matter anybody who is on the right Barry Weiss is not even on the white right if you are if you are not of the hardcore left then the left sees you as an improper human being right they will not allow you to appear in their pages on a regular basis or if they do they will do so extraordinarily grudgingly okay and in the Atlantic was considered a more moderate sort of publication right there are more moderate publications that try to do this but they are becoming fewer and far between and just to point out that the Atlantic is not consistent about their standards for public rhetoric the Atlantic champions the fact that they are the home of tonic EC codes tonic ICI Coates wrote about 9/11 first responders that they were quote-unquote not human to me that is a direct quote from Tony he's he quotes a ton in town he's he coats hey the fact is that the Atlantic has given glowing profiles to people like Peter Singer Peter Singer is a in it is a quote unquote ethicist at Princeton who forcibly advocates for the murder of children outside the womb he says if a woman wants to kill a baby after it is born that is okay so just to be straight about this Peter Singer says killing a baby after it's born is okay because babies don't have an awareness of their time and place in the universe because they're stupid and so you can kill them right this is Peter Singer stated position on on genocide against small children against babies that is worthy of some sort of decent profile in the Atlantic by Kevin Williamson is too harsh on people who actually kill their babies and this is consider something just egregious and wrong and terrible it's pretty amazing and demonstrates the extremism of left in a second I'm gonna explain to you why it is that this has some pretty dramatic ramifications for the entire political discourse because you know Williamson may be an iconoclastic figure you may not know who he is you may not care about the Atlantic but this is an indicator of where our political discourse is going and it is nowhere good I have a lot of thoughts on this first you're gonna have to go over to daily wired icon and subscribe

just wanna listen later for free go over to iTunes go over to SoundCloud go over to YouTube we are the largest fastest growing conservative show in the nation all righty so I want to talk a little bit more about Kevin Williamson here so here is why this is a problem you may think that Williamson is crazy you may hate his viewpoints you may think that Williamson is garbage Kevin Williamson first of all is a very good writer second of all Kevin Williamson is wildly anti-trump when I say he is wildly anti-trump I don't mean he just opposed Trump in the election I mean that he wrote a column when Trump announced called the ape descends the escalator I mean that this is a guy who in his comps has called Donald Trump's sons Uday and COO say okay he is not subtle about his dislike for President Trump and even he was not acceptable to the left because he has he has a view on abortion that is outside the mainstream and as I say leftist views on abortion which are inherently outside the mainstream those are not outside the mainstream according to the Atlantic they're just fine again Peter Singer is probably just fine for the Atlantic but Kevin Williamson is not acceptable what does this mean what this means that the left is doing something really really damaging to American discourse they're shrinking the Overton Window can the Overton Window it's a term that I believe is originally used by the VP of a think-tank it was named after him the Overton Window means the range of acceptable discourse right so in any conversation there's a range of acceptable discourse there are people who you say are just not acceptable to talk to you people who for example say that black people are innately inferior right that's it those are people who are just not worth talking to that is not acceptable discourse now this does not mean they they don't have a right to say what they want to say they've a right to say whatever they want to say it's the First Amendment welcome to America that's fine but I am NOT a moral relativist and I don't believe that just because you have a right to say something means that you should say it or that everything that is said is equal in value okay so there's something called the Overton Window which is the which is the window of acceptable discourse or a useful discourse but what the left has done is they've shrunk the Overton Window down to about pinprick size okay so the Overton Window is now the space of opinion between Bernie Sanders and maybe Kamala Harris right that's basically the level of acceptable discourse between tana he codes intersectional leftism and Bernie Sanders socialist leftism everything in between there is cool but if you're outside that Overton Window then you are unacceptable so what does this mean well it means that the left has now separated discourse not into three categories but Institute so here are the three categories I have for speech there is the acceptable there's the unacceptable right outside the Overton Window and in there is the acceptable stuff but I disagree with it and there's lots of that stuff I'd say most discourse is stuff that I disagree with but is within the Overton Window what the left has done instead is they have said there is the stuff we agree with and then there is everything else and everything else is unacceptable so that means that Kevin Williamson is now a deplorable it means that I am in a plural it means that Barry Weiss a columnist for The New York Times who I'm sure voted for Hillary Clinton is it deplorable it means that people like Bret Stevens in Ross dude hat these people are deplorable it means that again Sam Harris is deplorable Sam Harris and I disagree about a wide variety of things but Sam Harris once said on national television that Islam is more dangerous religion than Christianity and suddenly he was another Brett Weinstein right a leftist socialist college professor at Evergreen State College who refused to not teach on a day that the students said we only want non-white teachers teaching he showed up anyway and wanted to teach you know that guy was declared an deplorable because he was outside the acceptable range of Windows right you say outside the acceptable range of opinions so what happens when you do this well what happens when you do this is it means that you are lumping in a bunch of people you disagree with with unacceptable bigots right so now Kevin Williamson is in the same category according to the left as Richard Spencer I'm in the same category as Richard Spencer you wonder why I get labeled the Nazi by idiots on campus who don't know the first thing about me because I am not agreeing with them therefore I am a Nazi it is that simple I am not agreeing with them therefore I am part of this basket of deplorable so I am now outside the Overton Window and I must be excluded for the from the range of acceptable discourse this is why President Trump is president this is why for a short period of time the alt-right was in the ascendance the reason is because this leaves people who have now been thrown out of the acceptable range with a choice right we can either say listen and we still think there are three categories right not 2/3 we still think that you may disagree with us but we're in the acceptable category and so we refuse to allow you to lump us in with people like Richard Spencer we refuse to allow you to label us a deplorable like some of the other people you're labeling deplorable right you can do that or you can say listen screw you guys you don't labeled everyone a Nazi so if you're labeling me a Nazi I don't know if I know I'm not a Nazi maybe the other people you're labeling Nazis also are not Nazis maybe all these bad people who are already out here maybe they're out here just because you don't like them maybe you ought to give their views a second look because if you're labeling me the same way you're labeling them if I get hit with the same category that they're being hit with then how do I know that you are honest in your original appraisal of those people and so there's a real temptation on the part of people who have been thrown out of the of the acceptable category by the left to simply band together and say listen we're all in this together because we hate you guys because you guys threw us out we're out here in the cold you throw us out of the cabin and now it's snowing so we can either argue amongst ourselves in the snow or we can all band together and we can try to break back into the cabin right now that's sort of the idea that's being that's being pushed here now the moral thing to do would say listen we're gonna try to break in the cabinet without the people we think are bad we have our own independent viewpoints I buy own independent viewpoint and you can try to throw me out of the range of acceptable discourse but I refuse to accept your label and I refuse to accept that you're labeling me in the same way that you label a bunch of people who really are disgusting and who really do have a disgusting views but the temptation is going to be always a never to simply say listen you've thrown us all out aligned to the alliances of convenience if you have declared war on us well we're not gonna we're not gonna play by the Marquess of Queensberry rules you declare war on us we'll take the allies we can get and we'll fight back against you the left has been counting on the virtue of conservatives to keep them from making common cause with truly garbage people but that makes no sense if you call conservatives garbage people and then you say yes but you really should continue to separate yourself off from the actual garbage people you can't have it both ways if we're garbage then you have to expect us not to act virtuous right this is you want to know why we're entering into a tribal routine here why we're getting closer and closer to political tribalism that is going to end poorly for all involved the reason is because the left has created the anti left tribe okay that's what's happened this is why this is why Donald Trump was successful he didn't campaign as a conservative the campaign is an anti left fighter and a lot of people said okay fine well if he's against them I'm with him this is how you generate that if the left really wanted to have a serious conversation they wanted to prevent this sort of tribalism all they have to do is recognize that there are people with whom they disagree that they will still allow to be part of the discourse but I don't mean people like David Frum who would pretend to disagree with them but really agree with them on a broad swath of policies if they continue along these lines they're gonna they're really cruisin for a bruisin they're really cruising there's gonna be a backlash and it's going to be uncontrollable and they're not gonna like the impact they're already not liking the impact is the backlash is already underway okay so now I want to talk a little bit about some insanity that's happening in Great Britain because this is truly crazy so apparently there's been a wild upswing in the amount of murder in London well that's not a tremendous shock considering that the demographics of London have changed that the policing in London has changed wildly that the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan is really terrible at his job but the murder rate in London now outstrips the murder rate in New York which is pretty incredible actually right the murder rate in Britain has always been extraordinarily low this is why when people say well you know you ban guns in Britain that's why the murder rate is low the murder rate was low before the bans on guns and the murder rate in Britain was always quite low but here is here is what it says according to today online on Thursday April 5th five teenagers were stabbed in an hour and a half before sunset including a boy of 13 all these attacks took place in London over the past week part of an apparent spike in violence in the British capital after a long period of steady declines in violent crime the city has averaged in excess of three killings a week so far this year more than 50 people have been killed in London since the start of 2018 the total for all of 2017 a year when the city suffered multiple deadly terrorist attacks was 116 criminologists have expressed caution about drawing conclusions from only a few months figures but if the uptick continues it will amount to London's highest level of violence in more than a decade a year with 200 homicides for a city of 8.5 million people would be far from a shocking high in the u.s. New York City had 292 murders last year according to the 2018 police commissioner's report that was a record low but right now London's murder rate is outstripping the murder rate in New York City which is again a pretty incredible thing so I do love what they are now talking about in London they're not talking about banning knives no joke so they're using the exact same logic they used about guns and now they're applying it to knives so Sadiq Khan has announced a broad new knife control policy designed to keep quote/unquote weapons of war out of the hands of it wanders looking to cause others harm the UK Parliament is considering bills that restrict the manufacture and purchase of kitchen cooking knives because they have points on them because they're pointy things so I guess machetes would still be okay like the one that that guy used a couple of years ago that that Muslim terrorists used to chop down an actual British soldier on the streets of on the streets of London that'll still be okay because as we all know machetes aren't really dangerous like him from every horror film we know machetes aren't dangerous only knives are dangerous but they're going to start determining how exactly knives are distributed the tough immediate measures involve an incredible police crackdown a ban on home deliveries of knives and acid and expanding law enforcement stop and search powers so the police may stop anyone they believed to be a threat or planning a knife or acid attack Khan announced Friday the city has created a quote violent crime task force 120 officers tasked with rooting out knife wielding individuals in public spaces and is pumping nearly 50 million dollars into the Metropolitan Police Department so they can better armed themselves against knife attacks he's also empowering the Met Police to introduce targeted patrols of extra stop and search powers for areas worst-affected according to a statement now one of the what's what's really kind of hilarious here is that one of the reasons that the crime rate is going up is because Khan is responsible for according to Emily's inaudi at the Daily wire for decreasing the number of stop and searches having previously declared the tactic racist and potentially Islamophobic so in other words got rid of stop and stop and frisk in London saying that it was targeting too many young Muslim guys and then the crime rate went up and now he's gonna target everyone it's not really clear what they're gonna use in London to cut their food anymore if you can't get a home delivery of a knife and if you're not allowed to carry at home how do you actually get the knife from the department store home Parliament is set to take up heavy knife control legislation when it resumes this week the UK government is expected to introduce a ban on online knife sales and home knife deliveries so now you have to go to a store to purchase a knife maybe it's have a license to purchase a knife you have to have to be what if the Accu linaria specialist they declare illegal to possess the zombie knives and knuckle dusters in private zombie knives are those defined as being manufactured for the purpose of being used as a person-to-person weapon and banned sales of caustic materials to anyone under the age of 18 of course that won't really stop anything since most of these acid attacks that have been occurring are occurring among people who are late teenagers or older London seen a dramatic uptick in murder rates of course so again it ain't about the knives folks maybe you ought to look at the people who are wielding the knives maybe you ought to be looking at the people who are actually performing the acid attacks but since we're not allowed to do that we're gonna crackdown our knives and then we'll crack down on fists and then we'll crack down on any blunt object in your home you want to be allowed to have blunt objects soon we'll end up all sitting in blank room with no furniture because anything can be used maybe baby pillows but nobody can use pillows for suffocation so eventually we all just walk him around like John Travolta in the bubble boy because that presumably will stop crime not actually targeting criminals pretty amazing stuff but demonstrates what happens when an entire civilization loses their mind and stops targeting criminality and starts instead pretending that the tools of criminality are more important than the criminals themselves ok time for of a couple of things that I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like so on the way home yesterday in the car it was a long drive and so everyone was asleep and so that's a good time to listen to musical theater because you actually get a story told to you well one of my favorite musicals is of course Pippin and one of the best numbers from Pippin is corner of the sky here's what it sounds like in the new Broadway production is just tremendous I believe it's on tour now if it's not then it was recently but the production is really really good it's not for children obviously it's pg-13 and up but this song is just great everything has its season thing has its time show me a reason and also show me your I can't spit on the windowsill children fit in the snow so why do I feel I don't feel anywhere I go rivers belong where they can round he goes so this show won best Tony best best best musical Tony in the 1970s and it's really first-rate one of the things that's fascinating about this show is that the whole show is about a guy who has these wide world aspirations for changing the world and making a dent in the world and all this stuff and it's about him learning that you can that may be the best way to make a dent in the world is just by living a life where you bring up your wife and kids and it's a pretty pretty amazing message that comes out of Broadway particularly because Broadway is so far to the left but it's it's an important message nonetheless so check out Pippin if you ever have a chance it's really it's really great okay a couple of other things that I like so apparently Bill Maher over the weekend defended Laura Ingraham Laura Ingraham of course was victim of a boycott by a bunch of leftist because she said something quasi mean to a parkland student which are not allowed to do and Bill Maher comes out he says listen I don't like Laura Ingraham but this is stupid good for Bill Maher I want to defend Laura Ingraham I know that sounds ridiculous but it has to do with the Parkland kids and guns and free speech now I think those kids did a great thing they put this issue in a place we've never had it before and I wish them success but you know if you're gonna be out there in the arena and make yourselves the champions of this cause people are gonna have the right I think to argue back here's what she she tweeted David hog rejected by four colleges because he put that up there because of course we have to share everything to which he applied and whined about it okay maybe you shouldn't say that about a seventeen-year-old but again he is in the arena and then he calls for a boycott of her sponsors now what what is really is that American to coffee explain something because I and he complains about bullying that's bullying boycott job once it is wrong you should we do this by team you should do it by principle good for a good firm are good from our I mean what Mars saying here is exactly correct and again you know Mars one of these guys who knows because he has been thrown out of the left for his failures to abide by the window of acceptable discourse right he said some things the left doesn't like on occasion and this is because particularly that Islam and this has made him a target of the left the more the left throws people out and calls for boycotts against them and the more they are destroying their own credibility even with the people who supposedly like them okay time for a couple of things that I hate okay thing that I hate number one so there's a story out of Bradenton Florida and this is supposed to be some sort of grand civil rights issue apparently there's a seventeen-year-old named Lizzy Martin and she was told by the principal of her school or the school district that she needed to put band-aids on her nipples why because she showed up to school in a gray Calvin Klein shirt without wearing any bra and so they tried to make her put on a second t-shirt and then they said well maybe you should just cover up your nipples and she said we went to the clinic and the nurse gave me band-aids in there and she told me to X out my nipples she followed the command saying she felt she had no other options her mother told the outlet that school dean made a big deal about it said this was a shirt that was unisex that was too big that was not form-fitting she said there was a double standard than a male with excessive breast tissue wouldn't be asked to confine the movement of his chest okay this is the stupidest crap ever he's a 17 year old girl she's in a class a bunch of seven-year-old boys if you really believe there's a 17 year old girl with half a grain of intelligence on planet earth who doesn't know exactly what she's doing when she wears no bra to class with a bunch of 17 year old boys he got another thing coming this doesn't mean boys should sexually harass obviously not it doesn't mean that boys should say anything or do anything to her none of that is the case but if you think it's not distracting to boys when there are girls walking around with their nipples showing you're out of your mind look what are we supposed to pretend that human nature doesn't exist now is what we are supposed to pretend and are we supposed to pretend that the 17 year old girl doesn't know that human nature exists are we set end this is a thing okay that most schools have dress codes the reason they have dress codes is precisely to avoid this sort of situation where boys are being distracted by girls and girls are being distracted by boys honestly you want the best thing for girls in school really there's been studies to prove this the best things for girls in school are sex segregated classes okay like when I went to high school I went to an Orthodox Jewish high school there was a boy school there was a girls school girls and sex segregated classes do better they do better not it's not for the benefit of the boys that this happens girls do better why because girls have the weird idea that boys want them to be stupid and sexualized and so they played to those stereotypes but if they're with a bunch of girls then they're just there for the academics but again if a 17 year old girl wears something completely inappropriate to school and she's distracting the other students I fail to see how this is completely like what the school district did that was so unbelievably wrong here they probably shouldn't told her to go put like band-aids on her nipples but they should have called up her parents and say you know mom bring her a sweatshirt or they should have had one of the teachers say okay here's a sweatshirt put on the sweatshirt but again like if you're gonna take this logic to its full extreme presumably what you would say is that you should walk around topless and that should be no problem everybody should basically say okay no problem you know what it's just listen if a boy walks around topless it wouldn't be then you wouldn't have a problem with that yes because boys and girls are different here first of all you don't want boys walking around topless either but but to pretend that a dude walking around topless is the same thing as a woman walking around topless in American society is fully crazy it's fully crazy hey but I guess we have to completely pretend that again reality doesn't exist in human nature doesn't exist and so it's some sort of grand sin that the police that the that the school district thought that a girl should actually cover up her nipples in a class with boys what stupidity what stupidity okay other things that I hate so last week I made it sound like the stuff on Clark case in Sacramento was a little more clear-cut than it was and I want to correct myself on that because I think that it's important that we get as much of the truth about this as possible so here is the actual tape of what happened Stephon Clark so here is first of all the introduction to that tape police responded to reports of a broken window David French over national view describes it and when you watch all the released footage you can see the initial response is pretty calm and casual two officers politely knock on a door they asked permission to search her backyard they find nothing and then they walk back to the street meanwhile a helicopter overhead spots a person trying to break into a car and then jumping a fence and moving to a neighboring house where he looks in a car window and that person is Stephon Clark so he is it in the middle of criminal activity and then you run this to his grandparents house there's nothing visible in his hands at that time the police run to the house they spot Clark in the driveway and they yell hey show me your hands stop stop and Clark instead of obeying flees to the back of the house the officers pursue and they around the corner of the house and one says show me your hands gun okay so they think that he has gone they retreat behind the corner for roughly one or two seconds then they round the corner again one officer yells show me your hands gun gun gun and they start firing and twenty seconds later he's dead so the encounter from yelling hey - Clark - firing the first shot takes approximately 17 seconds here is what it looks like on the body cams okay so as you can see is really difficult to see what's going on there it's very difficult to see and so I wouldn't want to be unfair to the officers by saying that they went in there with the intent to kill or anything like this but does this look like something negligent to me it looks like I mean that the amount of time that he's given to respond is very short now should he have immediately obeyed the officers command yes I mean this is rule number one when an officer tells you to do something you obey the command also should she have been breaking into cars probably not this is not a good idea however that said does that mean that officers are completely free from FAL ability in these sorts of situations the guy was unarmed he was unarmed okay and when he comes back around they say show me your hands gun gun gun it the I mean you can hear it it's right on the back of it it's not show me your hands gun gun gun right is show me your hands gun gun gun so they're gonna chance to give him a chance to respond and and I think David French get to this raises before you object and tell me that routine encounters can into escalate I know that but what I'm questioning are probabilities in perspective here are some questions if it's dark police are sprinting and flashlights are shaking what are the chances that the cops first assessment the suspect had a gun or wrong what was the reasonable risk of backing off and continuing to get strong verbal commands rather than immediately moving from cover to an exposed position and opening fire what are the possibility that the suspect hadn't heard the commands and all there's some evidence that he may have had earbuds in also what's the background level of risk here Sacramento hasn't seen a cop shot and killed in the line of duty for almost 20 years and it's true the cops have seconds to make life-and-death decisions but you know who else has like that who has just a couple of seconds to figure that out is the suspect so if you don't give the suspect a chance to respond then what exactly are you supposed to do this doesn't mean that these cops are gonna go to jail sort of suggested last week it's possible that they won't it's possible the people will find this their story convincing or at least they will find it justifiable or at least excusable but there are some problems of training I think among some of our police officers and certainly this does raise questions about deadly use of force by police officers and whether they should be so quick on the trigger in some of these particular situations okay so I just wanted to clarify all of that because I don't want to get any of the facts wrong by the way there's another correction I think I have to make from last week as well and that was on the show last week I'd mentioned the YouTube shooter and I think I'd suggested that she was Muslim I said of course that her religion had nothing to do with the shooting because she just seems like a crazy person apparently she was Baha'i it doesn't really change much because I said religion had nothing to do with it but just to correct the record I want to make sure I get as many facts correct as I can on the show and by the way folks you have all but you all have my email addresses be Shapiro daily wear comm if you hear me make a mistake on the air please let me know so I can correct it on the air so that I'm not screwing things up all righty so I think we've run out of time we'll do a federalist paper tomorrow probably sometime later this week because we've run out of time but we'll see you here then I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Glover executive producer Jeremy boring
