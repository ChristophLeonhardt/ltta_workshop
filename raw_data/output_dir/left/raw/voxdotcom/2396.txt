1
00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:06,450
So in the past few years, we’ve seen state
legislatures introduce bills

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,040
that basically require that students have
to learn cursive writing in elementary school.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,500
Cursive handwriting is not in the Common Core
state standards

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,590
which have replaced the English and Language
Arts standards in 43 states.

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,320
And so this is led to a concern that if it’s
not on the test,

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,800
if students can type their assignments or
print their assignments,

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,259
cursive handwriting is just going to disappear
and die out.

8
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:32,540
But the truth is, cursive was really fading
out before the Common Core.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,340
In 2006, the SAT started to require an essay
-- and this is how we have data on

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,250
what students chose to write.
And only 15% of students used cursive, this

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,400
was kids who were in elementary school in
the 90s.

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,380
Cursive handwriting became taught more
commonly at the same time that education

13
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,500
become more democratic.
So it started with something called the Spencerian

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,870
script.
If you’ve seen a college diploma, if you’ve

15
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:02,030
seen a wedding invitation with that really
loopy, fancy writing, that’s what the Spencerian

16
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,820
script was. It’s beautiful.
But obviously it’s not very practical to

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,249
learn to write this really gorgeous, loopy
handwriting.

18
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:13,880
And so in the 1920s, which was when education
was becoming much more universal, not just

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,639
at the elementary level but continuing on
past that,

20
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:19,139
that’s also when they developed a new method
of writing cursive.

21
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:23,380
It’s called the Palmer Method. Certainly
if you have a grandparent with beautiful handwriting,

22
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,920
they’re probably writing the Palmer method.
And there were two major cursive styles that

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,600
were taught from the 1960s on: The D’Nealian
method, and the Zane-Bloser method.

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,759
This is a big debate. Is there a reason to
learn cursive, besides sort of a nostalgic

25
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,950
idea that this is an important skill that
you have as an adult?

26
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,139
The arguments in favor are that it’s a fine
motor skill thing, it’s good for kids to

27
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:50,509
have learn to use their hands this way.
And there’s also this sort of patriotic

28
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:55,009
argument that the Constitution and the Declaration
of Independence are written in cursive, and

29
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:59,599
what if kids can’t read these founding documents
in the original print.

30
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,389
The arguments against teaching cursive are
mostly that nobody has shown that there’s

31
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:07,959
really a major benefit to learning cursive.
So it’s a lot of time and energy spent in

32
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:11,730
the third and 4th grade, learning basically
a second system of writing after you’ve

33
00:02:11,730 --> 00:00:00,000
already learned to write.
