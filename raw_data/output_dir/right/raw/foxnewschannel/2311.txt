THEY GET IN THAT ROOM, DONALD

52
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:34,534
TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN CAN MAKE A

53
00:01:34,534 --> 00:01:34,834
DEAL.

54
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:35,368
>> WE WILL SEE.

55
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:36,703
JUST IN THE PAST COUPLE OF

57
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:41,040

ONE MORE NOTE, ANALYST DOES GIVE

63
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:51,451
A LOT OF CREDIT TO PRESIDENT

64
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:52,685
TRUMP FOR GETTING TALKS WITH

65
00:01:52,685 --> 00:01:54,053

66
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:56,589
HE WARNS, LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE,
