and this is where the microaggression culture comes in the idea of speeches violence which was chanted at may products at Berkeley which is it which is an insane concept just on the face of especially at Berkeley yeah it's it's it's pretty wild over there but and what was really wild about that one is the the radical shift because I had spoken there the previous year with no violence whatsoever the next year I required 500 police officers for protection for some odd reason but what exactly does this trend hold true across parenting styles across cultures or is it or is it just a subsection that we're really talking about yeah so this is also new that I I can't give you a solid answer we don't have data on this what we we do in a section in the book we did spend some time researching social class differences because we know there's a huge amount of research on social class differences in parenting and we read two really good books Annette Lareau has a book called unequal childhoods and Robert Putnam um has a book called our kids and they both come to the same conclusion which is that differences by race and parenting are actually fairly small once you control for class so upper-middle class black parents are more similar to upper middle class white parents than they are to working-class of either sex and so working-class parents do give their kids less supervision which is good part of the problem is in the 90s we took away most of kids on supervised time by the ages or 90s we stopped letting kids out to play without supervision it's fearing that we thought they'd be abducted or something like that so the working class is not as overprotective now working-class kids have a lot of other problems they face a lot more trauma a lot more threat like real trauma like physical trauma relational trauma but in this country right now at elite schools there was some research came out last year at many of our top schools there are more kids where children of the top 1% income then the bottom 60% so our elite schools are populated overwhelmingly by the top few percent of the income distribution and that's part of it rich kids have a lot more time to do symbolic politics working-class kids they have to pay their they have to pay their tuition they have a lot of other obligations so the the culture of safety isms to be especially intense in upper-middle class upper class elite coastal communities
