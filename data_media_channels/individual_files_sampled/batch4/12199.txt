as the protests surrounding presidents Trump immigration refugee executive order grew over the weekend uber came under fire for the great crime of having turned off their surge pricing to JFK Airport in New York in order to help travelers get home what was so terrible about that the New York taxi workers Association had participated you know one hour work stoppage to join the protest against Trump's executive order so uber was supposedly undermining that protest even though uber turned off their surge pricing to avoid making a profit only initiated that policy half an hour after the stoppage ended and ubers executives actually opposed the Trump executive order but that was not good enough virtue signaling has swept the nation with leftists policing each other to determine who doesn't clap the longest so we can shoot them and now BuzzFeed has joined the fray just weeks after their idiotic targeting of HGTV couple chip and Joanna Gaines for destruction because they committed the grave sin of attending a church where the Bible quote the pastor quotes the Bible on homosexuality BuzzFeed now wants to target every other company it can find and give it the uber treatment BuzzFeed San Francisco bureau chief Matt Honan tweeted quote we're following which companies are speaking out on Muslim ban and which are not buzz feeds Tom Guerra then ran a piece in which he suggested as Silicon Valley debated its leaders stance on immigration ban corporate America simply said nothing at all Silicon Valley Guerra wrote said quote something which is more than can be said for the rest of Corporate America whose leaders have largely remained behind a wall of silence since Friday's announcement even as plenty of their employees and customers at home and around the world were facing the prospect of being banned from entering the United States so here's the question is it truly necessary for every company in the United States to take a position on a controversial executive order that is actually not a Muslim ban that has not yet been fully interpreted and that is still being adjudicated in the courts did every company in America have the responsibility to sound off on Obamacare in fact when corporations did sound off on Obamacare if you recall the left called them whiners and told them to shut up the left wields the media as a club in its fight to push the country to the left and simply staying out of the fight that's no longer tolerated if you do business you're expected to do the bidding of the left which means the right will have to respond in kind in order to compensate for the leftist bullying and every company will be forced into the polarizing political space rather than merely providing the best go services at the most competitive prices on behalf of their shareholders that isn't good for consumers it isn't good for companies it isn't good for the country if people want to speak out by all means they should if they don't want to speak out that's their prerogative to and if they don't want to turn their companies into political footballs over issues that aren't even close to clear-cut that is certainly justifiable i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show all righty I got to tell you folks I mean under Trump it just feels like every event in the next ten years has been crammed into one year it's amazing it's amazing

was a busy weekend a couple of notes that we have to make before anything else everybody on both sides is constantly attempting to attribute genius to their side and the other side there's this broad widespread public perception that people in politics generally know what they're doing they generally know what they're talking about that there must be a big plan so if Trump appears to have screwed something up no must be part of a conspiratorial shadowy plan no maybe you just screwed it up and if the left screw something up then there's on the right this tendency to attribute it to some evil shadowy conspiracy maybe it's just that they're incompetent as Adam Carolla is fond of saying you know one of the one of the most disappointing facts about life is when you're a child do you think the adults know what they're doing and then you become an adult you realize that adults are idiots they're just stupid you know that you thought when you were a kid that they all have cars and houses and that means they're smart you thought when you're a kid the President of the United States knows what he's doing the media know what they're doing know everybody's stupid if you start from that premise politics becomes a lot simpler clearer and more truthful so we begin today with Trump's of course Immigration and Refugee executive order the media have lost their freakin minds over this thing they've lost their minds over it so we're actually going to go through it and we're going to tell you what's in the executive order is it a Muslim ban no is it legal maybe is it useful kinda was it rolled out like a bunch of like a bunch of monkeys having to head trying to have intercourse with a basketball yeah I was basically rolled out at that as badly as you could so here's what was actually in the executive order we'll start with what's in it then we'll talk about whether it's useful and legal and then we'll get to the left insane response because it is totally over the top it is totally crazy and that's only the beginning of the stuff that was happening over whoo it's pretty Wow it's gonna be a busy for years gay okay so number one the executive order invokes 911 so Trump says because of 9/11 because it's refugee because of attacks by people who have come into the United States on student visas we really have to crack down on the visa system and that means that we're going to crack down on the on the visa system we're going to down on both immigrants and non-immigrants meaning people who visit the country as well as people who are attempting to immigrate to the country and we're gonna crack down on all of that the order suspends visas from Nationals of countries of particular origin so the Secretary of Homeland Security as well as Secretary of State and the DNI Director of National Intelligence are tasked under the order with determining the standard necessary for visa entry within 30 days they're gonna rewrite the standard all entering in the United States is suspended as immigrants and non-immigrants of such persons for 90 days from the date of such order so these are the countries this is where everybody's saying you're not able to get in if you're from Iraq Iran Syria Libya and in a couple of other countries not Afghanistan not Saudi Arabia not Pakistan that's one of the flaws in this and we'll get to that in a second the order also states there may be more countries that are added to this banned list so again it's seven countries they're talking about is Tehran Iraq Syria Libya Somalia Sudan Yemen those are the seven that they are talking about the Secretary of State and homeland security are able to waive the executive order for individuals so if they determine that there's an interpreter who wants to get in from Iraq they can waive the executive order okay refugees are blocked for 120 days all refugees are blocked for 120 days while we come up with new standards Syrian refugees are banned indefinitely until Trump says okay so they're given a special standard priority is given to victims of religious based persecution so what it says is that the Secretary of State is directed to make changes to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious based persecution provided the religion of the individual is minority religion in the individuals country of nationality so the idea here presumably is that Christians living in Syria will be given higher priority they'll still be able to get in Muslims who are refugees from Syria are gonna have a harder time now that isn't actually a major shift from current refugee law current refugee law defines a refugee as any person who is outside the country of such persons nationality and who is unable to return to the country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of religion so that obviously encompasses Christians the fact is that the Obama administration really cracked down on Christian immigration from Syria which was truly an awful awful thing they took in I think single-digit numbers of Syrian refugees who were Christian in the last year but they took in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees were not that's that's ridiculous the order limits the number of refugees total in 2017 to 50,000 people is all wow that's just awful okay except that was the normal standard like three years ago it was only up to in the last couple of years and then you get into the screw-up so all of this is basically okay it's actually relatively moderate this isn't a giant Muslim ban they're 1.5 billion Muslims all around the world they're not going to immediately be banned from the United States the most populous Muslim countries are still allowed to send people to the United States they're not banned again this doesn't cover a lot of the countries it probably shouldn't cover like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and Egypt rate doesn't cover a lot of those places all it is it's it's temporary moratorium it's on outright ban so it's not a Muslim ban okay there's no way this is a Muslim ban I've read the text members of the media should bother reading the text but they don't it's not a Muslim ban folks it just isn't and the media is lying about that which brings us to the roll out so the way that you normally would roll this thing out let's say that you did this in a normal fashion first you run it by the office of legal counsel to make sure that the thing is well written legally second you probably want to pair it with some sort of executive order regarding how to help refugees right so you don't look like you're inhumane so what you would do is you'd say we're signing an executive order to help fund the creation of safe zones in Syria and in the Muslim Middle East for Syrian refugees that they're not just getting slaughtered in Aleppo instead they have a place to go but they're not gonna come here right that's the idea that's what you know and invite whether it's actually Trump's policy he wants those safe zones he could have announced that at the same time he didn't third you make sure all the agencies are on the same page you say we're gonna implement this you tell all the agencies we're gonna sign this thing right and you give them draft you say we're gonna sign this thing and when we sign it it's gonna go into effect but you have all have advance warning you know how this is gonna work instead the way this was rolled out is Trump signed it nobody in any of the agencies knew what was going on DHS didn't know it was going on the Border Patrol didn't know what was going on and so they called the White House and they said okay well you know this this order doesn't make clear what happens to people who already have visas right how about people who already have green cards what do we do with those people and DHS said what we'd like to do is let them in and then if you want to check their visas later check their visas later but don't hold them up at the airport or turn them around just because there visiting family back in Iraq or something instead they went to Steve Bannon and Steven Miller now I need to be clear about something with Bannon and Miller Bannon is the superior Miller is the inferior ok Bannon is the one in charge Steven Miller is a 33 year old speechwriter who has some policy expertise on immigration Steve Bannon is the chief strategist to the White House Steve Bannon is like 60 years old and has Trump's ear and is very very tight with Bannon the person who is the subordinate here is Miller Miller's the one being tossed under the bus that is not fair here's what CNN reported the White House overruled the guidance from DHS according to officials familiar with the roll out that aura came from the president's inner circle led by Miller and Bannon okay it should really read Bannon and Miller Bannon is the powerful one their decision held that on a case-by-case basis DHS could allow green heart card holders to enter the United States before the President issued the order the White House did not seek the legal guidance of the Office of Legal Counsel apparently they didn't bother to go through the standard agency review process at all and it is worth noting that Donald Trump over the weekend also changed the constituency of the National Security Council to add Steve Annan who really is not qualified to sit on that thing and get rid of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff which just makes no sense at all if you want Bandhan in there at least don't get rid of the Joint Chiefs I mean my goodness or the DNI they got rid of Mike Pompeo as well so this is this is incompetent so two things can be true at once one the executive order isn't nearly what the media are preferring it to be it is not a Muslim ban it's actually rather moderate and two this could be just a botched abortion of a rollout and it really was it's just an awful awful rollout of a really not that big a deal program but everybody is making it into the end of the world because now you've got all these pictures of all of these people kids old people trying to get into the country and they have visas and they've been here for five years on a green card and now they're stuck at the airport and then you have the the reunion pictures with all the people cheering around like like Trump is trying to ban Muslims from the country and the hashtag Muslim ban trending even though it is not it is not a Muslim ban so let's go through a couple of quick questions about this thing first actually before we get to going through a couple of quick questions first we have to say thank you to our other advertiser for today and that is D STL decom so if you love jeans and I do I wear jeans pretty much every day you would know that if you could see my pants but you can't but I wear G pretty much everyday and and the jeans that I wear are from DST LD comet is luxury great denim and it goes for about 75 bucks so jeans don't normally cost you a couple hundred bucks I mean I have a pair of jeans that cost 200 bucks my DST LD jeans are just as good they're they're durable they were really well they fit really well and it's not bargain bin stuff I mean it's high-quality jeans 75 bucks DST LD come they also have jackets so they have bomber jackets and they have a bunch of new stuff that's really good-looking and great they guarantee the

right now and get $10 off your first order DST LD distilled DST LD comm slash pen right now 10 bucks off the first order so 65 bucks for a pair of jeans DST LT comm slash been distilled calm and they do really make high quality product so we want to answer a couple of questions and then we'll get to the left's reaction so answering a few questions about this first of all is this unprecedented no it's not totally unprecedented the media is making this out to be the end of the world no one's ever done anything like this before no there are a couple of precedents that are worth noting one President Obama had a six-month ban on Iraqi refugees in 2011 second in 1980 Jimmy Carter issued a ban on Iranian visa holders so there are a couple of differences between what Trump is doing now and what Obama and and Carter did first off Obama's order only affected refugees so Trump's order actually affects green card holders now they're backing off of that by the way but it presumably only affected green card holders it affected Green article there was a student visa as travel visas affected everyone whereas Obama's was only refugees and and Obama also implemented the policy quietly Trump did so openly so people say it's bad press okay I don't really care Carter about Carter spouse he put a moratorium on new Iranian visas with an exception for humanitarian purposes so he didn't ban refugees and a cancellation of then-current iranian american visas the purpose of that policy was to get the Iranians to give up the American hostages it wasn't meant as a broad-based indefinite policy so it's sort of like those cases and it's sort of not like those cases I wanted as honest as possible in how we analyze the actual law how about the legality of this thing is it legal or is it not legal and this is what people are asking because courts have issued stays on parts of this executive order there's a really interesting kind of legal argument for people who like the specifics between Andy McCarthy of National Review on one side and David buyer of the Cato Institute on the other it really comes down to two provisions of immigration law one provision says no person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race sex nationality place of birth or place of residence so that would seem to prevent these sort of bans on certain areas of the world that it's discrimination on the base of place of birth or place of residence okay that's provision one provision two says the president has the capacity to suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non immigrants on the basis of saying that they are detrimental to the interests of the United States the question is which one of these legal provisions is the more powerful is the one that gives Obama that gives the president gives Trump lots and lots of power or is the one that limits that power so buyer argues that it's the it's the non-discrimination provision that's more powerful and McCarthy argues that it's the presidential provision that's more powerful not really clear that's the part that's gonna be adjudicated in the courts there's pretty good case on both sides okay finally is this actually a smart order is the executive order actually smart so there are a couple of problems with the order itself first of all does it achieve its stated purposes so the media is pointing out that foreign-born refugees are responsible for like two deaths in America in the last ten years or 15 years and so they're saying it's not it's not calibrate it's not well calibrated to achieve its purposes and people on the right are saying well you know it's it's common sense you got to do it now this sort of mirrors on the one side to be intellectually honest this sort of mirrors on the one side the arguments that have been had over birth control p.m. not birth control gun control rather the the the idea that they'll put a blanket ban on assault weapons and people like me will say yeah but it's all weapons don't kill that many people they aren't using that many shootings and let's say right but it's common sense we have to do something okay now you have to calibrate the solution to the actual problem I agree that if we can't vet refugees regardless of whether they're terrorists we didn't let people in we can't vent that's just a good general principle just as there's a background check a federal background check that happens when you get a gun this is for mental illness and for criminal background check the same thing is true when it comes to if you're a federally licensed firearms dealer that's true the same thing should be true when it comes to coming into the country immigrating into the country so it's not really about Syrian refugees per se it should be applied to everyone it should be we're creating a new standard for visas and applies to everyone and the reason for that is that it's actually under broad right it's too narrow what if somebody comes from Saudi Arabia let's say on a student visa or travel visa they overstay their visa this policy doesn't really apply to them per se it doesn't stop them from coming into the country they're from Saudi Arabia right not from one of these seven named countries well every hijacker on 9/11 was from Saudi Arabia or Egypt they have a Pakistan lots of terrorists come from Pakistan doesn't do anything about Pakistan right so if you're gonna cite 9/11 is your rationale you should actually calibrate a policy that would have stopped 9/11 otherwise you fall into the same trap as folks on the left when they say that their policy wouldn't a stop Sandy Hook but it's good anyway right he actually needs a tailor the policy so that it'll help stop things so this is why I say this is a pretty narrow policy it actually is not a broad policy it's a pretty narrow policy second of all it's an over broad application again stopping people in the air with no warning is just foolish it leads to bad press the whole thing was done idiotic Lee and you can tell how idiotic Lee it was done because Van Daan's already tossing Miller under the bus bannon's already saying Steven Miller's fault like Joe Scarborough today was ripping on Steven Miller it's been ins its bandhans fault right I mean the fact is that Bandhan abandon is the guy who's who's largely in charge of these executive orders but he's blaming Miller to get out of it so that's that's where we stand on this thing now the left has lost its mind for that for us talking about what the left has responded you're gonna have to actually subscribe it's a Lee Weyer calm and you can watch the rest of the show there it can also be part of the
