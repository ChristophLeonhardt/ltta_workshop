00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:03,036
CLASSIFICATION AS COMMITTEE 

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:07,140
CLARIFIED -- PACIFIED THAT 

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,441
NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN. 

4
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:12,612
JUDGE KAVANAUGH,  THAT REFLECTS 

5
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:13,179
IN YOUR CREDIBILITY. 

6
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,115
IF YOU SAID I DON'T WANT TO 

7
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,181
HAVE CLOUD OVER THIS 

8
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:16,749
NOMINATION, I'M PREPARED TO 

9
00:00:16,749 --> 00:00:17,817
ÃºSU 

10
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,386
ASK TO THE COMMITTEE, PLEASE, 

11
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:24,124
WITHHOLD FURTHER HEARINGS UNTIL 

12
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,025
YOU DISCLOSE EVERYTHING. 

13
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:25,925
WHY WON'T YOU DO THAT? 

14
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:28,161
>> SENATOR, I DO NOT BELIEVE 

15
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:29,796
THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT 

16
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:33,032
OTHER NOMINEES HAVE DONE. 

17
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:34,467
IT IS A DECISION FOR THE SENATE 

18
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:35,802
AND THE EXECUTIE BRANCH. 

19
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,505
THAT WAS EXPLAINED CLEARLY. 

20
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,039
>> ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT 

21
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,141
DECISION? 

22
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,775
>> IS NOT FOR ME TO SAY, 

23
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:43,610
SENATOR. 

24
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,411
THE LONG-TERM INTERESTS OF THE 

25
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:48,882
SENATE AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH 

26
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,149
ARE AT PLAY. 

27
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:53,119
JUSTIN'S -- THE JUSTICE 

28
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,824
EXPLAINED THAT WHILE, I THOUGHT.

29
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,559
I WASN'T HERE FOR THAT. 

30
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,894
>> LET ME INTERRUPT WITHOUT 

31
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,096
TAKING TIME AWAY. 

32
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,330
DON'T CHARGE THEM FOR THIS 

33
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,098
TIME. 

34
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:08,401
HERE IS SOMETHING, THE NOMINEE 

35
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,103
DOESN'T NEED ANY HELP FOR ME TO 

36
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:10,503
ANSWER THIS. 

37
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:11,604
WE DON'T CARE WHAT THE NOMINEE 

38
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:12,372
THINKS. 

39
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,941
WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RECORDS 

40
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:17,610
ACT. 

41
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,812
THAT'S IT WE ARE FOLLOWING IS 

42
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:19,112
THE LAW. 

43
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,346
>> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, 

44
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:23,016
FOLLOWING THE RECORDS ACT 

45
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,686
INVOLVES THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES, 

46
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,321
THEY ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THIS 

47
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,222
PROCESS. 

48
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:34,994
IT IS MR. BILL BURKE WHO WAS A 

49
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,129
FORMER ASSISTANT TO THE NOMINEE 

50
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,230
WHO HAS DECIDED WHAT WILL BE 

51
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,565
WITHHELD AND WHAT IS GOING TO 

52
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:38,965
BE CONFIDENTIAL. 

53
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:39,899
SO IT ISN'T THE PRESIDENTIAL 

54
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,234
RECORDS ACT. 

55
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:41,467
PLEASE. 

56
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:43,802
>> STILL, LET ME MAKE CLEAR 

57
00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:45,537
HERE, WE ANTICIPATE SOME OF 

58
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:46,573
THIS. 

59
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,575
LET ME READ THIS. 

60
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:49,608
CRITICIZE THE PROCESS FOR 

61
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:53,246
OBTAINING JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

62
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:53,746
RECORDS.  

63
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,649
THEY HAVE ACCUSED US OF TAKING 

64
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:02,422
THEM OUT OF THE PROCESS. 

65
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,590
PRESIDENT BUSH ACTED  

66
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,126
CONSISTENTLY WITH FEDERAL LAW 

67
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,894
WHEN HE EXPEDITED THE PROCESS 

68
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,329
AND GAVE US ACCESS IN RECORD 

69
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,131
TIME TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S  

70
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:13,900
RECORD. 

71
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,235
WE HAVE WORKED WITH ARCHIVES 

72
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:19,973
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AND THE 

73
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,074
DOCUMENTS THEY RECEIVED ARE THE 

74
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,708
SAME AS IF THEY HAD DONE THE 

75
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,744
INITIATIVE -- INITIAL REVIEW. 

76
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,980
THEY ARE NOT PERMITTED BY LAW 

77
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,014
TO PRODUCE RECORDS TO THE 

78
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,849
COMMITTEE WITHOUT GIVING BOTH 

79
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,351
PRESIDENT BUSH  AND A CURRENT 

80
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:35,154
PRESIDENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO 

81
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:37,757
REVIEW. 

82
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,292
THEY WERE NOT CUT OUT OF THE 

83
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:39,558
PROCESS. 

84
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:40,560
AS PRESIDENT BUSH'S  

85
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,998
REPRESENTATIVE SAID, WE HAVE 

86
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,434
SOUGHT, RECEIVED, AND FOLLOWED 

87
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,003
THE VIEWS ON ANY DOCUMENTS 

88
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,172
WITHHELD AS PERSONAL DOCUMENTS, 

89
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,173
THE RESULTING PRODUCTION OF 

90
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,608
DOCUMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE IS 

91
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,744
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS IF THEY 

92
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,280
HAD CONDUCTED THE REVIEW FIRST. 

93
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,714
AND THEN THOUGHT OUR VIEWS IN 

94
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,517
THE CURRENT VIEWS AS REQUIRED 

95
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,551
BY LAW. 

96
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:08,955
THEY RECEIVED THE SAME AS IF 

97
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,289
THE ARCHIVES HAD DONE THE 

98
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:11,624
INITIATIVE. 

99
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,127
WE ARE ABLE TO GET THEM FASTER 

100
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,528
BY DOING IT THIS WAY. 

101
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,330
THAT GAVE THE SENATE AND THE 

102
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,598
AMERICAN PEOPLE ACCESS IN 

103
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,167
RECORD TIME TO A SUPREME COURT 

104
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,069
NOMINEE WRECKER. 

105
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,638
CONTINUE -- RECORD. 

106
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,073
CONTINUE. 

107
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:30,543
>> THEY STATED THE WAY WE ARE 

108
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,244
HANDLING THE RECORDS ARE 

109
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,078
UNPRECEDENTED AND THEY HAVE 

110
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,848
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. 

111
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:36,683
THEY'VE ASKED TO PRODUCE 

112
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,117
RECORDS UNTIL THE END OF 

113
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:41,221
OCTOBER. 

114
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,355
THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD WE DON'T 

115
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:42,755
NEED YOU. 

116
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,791
WE ARE GOING TO FINISH THIS 

117
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,191
BEFORE THEN. 

118
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,059
I WOULD LIKE THIS BE PLACED IN 

119
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:49,862
RECORD RELATED TO THE RECORDS 

120
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:56,169
RELATED TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  

121
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,303
MAY HAVE CONSENT TO PLACES IN 

122
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:57,636
THE RECORD? 

123
00:03:57,636 --> 00:03:58,271
>> I'M SORRY? 

124
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,405
>> THE STATEMENT FROM THE 

125
00:03:59,405 --> 00:03:59,838
NATIONAL ARCHIVES? 

126
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:00,105
>> YES. 

127
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:00,539
WITHOUT OBJECTIVE. 

128
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:04,477
>> THANK YOU. 

129
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,979
YOU'VE SEEN THIS COMING FOR 12 

130
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:06,212
YEARS. 

131
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,546
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE 

132
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:08,748
2006 TEST 20 WHAT YOU GAVE. 

133
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,216
IT WAS AT A DIFFERENT TIME -- 

134
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:14,153
TESTIMONY THAT YOU GAVE. 

135
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,755
IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME. 

136
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:18,558
YESTERDAY, I ASKED YOU TO SHOW 

137
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,159
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT HAVE 

138
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:23,696
NOTHING TO HIDE BY COMING CLEAN 

139
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,399
WITH US ON THIS ISSUE. AND I 

140
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,701
WOULD LIKE TO REFER SPECIFICALLY

141
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:32,505
TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT 

142
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:36,242
WERE RAISED BECAUSE OF THAT 

143
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:36,876
2006 TESTIMONY. 

144
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:42,715
I BELIEVE WE HAVE A STATEMENT. 

145
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:43,950
I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN THIS. 

146
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,218
IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT YOU 

147
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,654
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR A 

148
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:48,054
LONG TIME. 

149
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,223
WHEN I WAS BACK IN THE DAY, AN 

150
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:56,262
ATTORNEY PREPARING FOR 

151
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,731
DEPOSITION, GIVING TESTIMONY AT 

152
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,134
TRIAL, I SAID TWO THINGS, TELL 

153
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,270
THE TRUTH AND DON'T ANSWER MORE 

154
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,705
THAN YOU ARE ASKED. 

155
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:10,977
DON'T VOLUNTEER INFORMATION. 

156
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,111
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, HE FAILED ON 

157
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,480
THE SECOND COAT . WHAT WAS YOUR 

158
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,316
ROLE IN THE ORIGINAL NOMINATION?

159
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,386
AT THE TIME, WHAT DID YOU KNOW 

160
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,287
ABOUT HIS ROLE IN CRAFTING THE 

161
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:26,259
POLICY? YOUR RESPONSE, SENATOR, 

162
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,494
I DID NOT. 

163
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,631
I WAS NOT INVOLVED. 

164
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,765
AND I'M NOT INVOLVED IN THE 

165
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,334
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RULES 

166
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:38,004
GOVERNING DETENTION OR AND SO I 

167
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,572
DO NOT HAVE THE INVOLVEMENT 

168
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,740
WITH THAT, AND WITH RESPECT TO 

169
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,175
THE DOMINATION, I HAVE KNOWN 

170
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,676
HIM BUT IT WAS NOT ONE OF THE 

171
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,447
NOMINATIONS THAT I HANDLE. 

172
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,648
I GOT IT. 

173
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:48,848
OKAY. 

174
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,116
THANK YOU. 

175
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,318
I ASKED YOU ABOUT THIS WE HAD A 

176
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:52,752
MEETING. 

177
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,319
YES. 

178
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,521
>> I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND 

179
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,022
YOUR ANSWER. 

180
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,257
IN TERMS OF HOW YOU COULD STATE

181
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,692
, I WAS NOT INVOLVED AND AM NOT 

182
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:03,496
INVOLVED IN THE QUESTIONS ABOUT 

183
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:07,366
THE RULES. 

184
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,768
YOU WERE INVOLVED IN THE 

185
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,970
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT ACCESS TO 

186
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,938
COUNSEL FOR DETAINEES. 

187
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,038
YOU CONFIRMED THIS DURING THE 

188
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,809

THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO BE 

197
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,629

224
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,492
YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT 

225
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,260
WHETHER I WAS INVOLVED IN THE 

226
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,331
PROGRAM, THAT TWO OTHER 

227
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,000
NOMINEES HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN. 

228
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,735
AND THE REPORT THAT SENATOR 

229
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:53,306

THE DETAINEES -- 

236
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,416
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH, THAT'S NOT 

237
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,350
THE QUESTION. 

238
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,853
DO YOU SEE ME ASKING YOU 

239
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,488
WHETHER YOU CRAFTED THE 

240
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:09,855
PROGRAM? 

241
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:10,122
I DIDN'T. 

242
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,991
I ASKED YOU ABOUT YOUR 

243
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,526
INVOLVEMENT IN THE HAYNES AND 

244
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,426

>> CRAFTING -- 

246
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,429
>> AND THEN YOU WENT FURTHER. 

247
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:18,864
YOU VIOLATED THE SECOND RULE I 

248
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:23,502
GIVE TO EVERY WITNESS, YOU 

249
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:24,737
ANSWERED MORE THAN I ASK. 

250
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,105
>> I TOLD THE TRUTH. 

251
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,139
>>EL WITH, YOU VOLUNTEERED MORE 

252
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,140
INFORMATION THAN I ASKED AND 

253
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,109
YOU WENT FURTHER THAN YOU 

254
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,743
SHOULD HAVE BECAUSE IN THE 

255
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,981
THREE SPECIFIC INSTANCES I'VE 

256
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,850
GIVEN YOU, YOU CLEARLY WERE 

257
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,583
INVOLVED ABOUT RULES GOVERNING 

258
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,116
DETENTION OF COMBATANTS. 

259
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:41,020
>> SO I UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION 

260
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,755
THEN AND I UNDERSTAND IT NOW IN 

261
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,057
MY ANSWER ABOUT THAT PROGRAM. 

262
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,627
I TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT AND 

263
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,262
THE REPORTS THAT HAVE COME OUT 

264
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,496
SUBSEQUENT HAVE SHOWED I TOLD 

265
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,331
THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT. 

266
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:55,401
MY NAME IS NOT IN THOSE 

267
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:55,667
REPORTS. 

268
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,069
NOW, FOR THE 2005 SIGNING 

269
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,637
STATEMENTS, BY THAT TIME I'M IN 

270
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:00,673
THE STAFF SECRETARY OFFICE, AND 

271
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:01,641
EVERYTHING THAT WENT TO THE 

272
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,075
PRESIDENT'S DESK, EVERYTHING 

273
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:06,445
THAT WENT TO THE PRESIDENT'S 

274
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,780
DESK WITH A FEW COVERT 

275
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,648
EXCEPTIONS WOULD HAVE SOMEHOW 

276
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,449
CROSSED MY DESK ON THE WAY. 

277
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,650
SO YOU ASKED, I SAID ON A 

278
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,752
SIGNING STATEMENT IT WOULD HAVE 

279
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:17,423
CROSSED MY DESK ON THE WAY, SO 

280
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,424
WOULD A SPEECH DRAFT ON THE 

281
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:18,724
IRAQ WAR. 

282
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,726
SO WOULD -- YOU KNOW, THOSE 

283
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,428
THINGS WOULD HAVE CROSSED MY 

284
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:23,296
DESK, PREPARED BY OTHER, NOT 

285
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:23,929
PREPARED BY ME, BUT THEY 

286
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:25,965
CROSSED MY DESK ON THE WAY TO 

287
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,833
THE PRESIDENT. 

288
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,234
>> IN THE 2006 HEARING YOU TOLD 

289
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:32,171

290
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,974
PRESIDENT BUSH ADVICE ON

SIGNING STATEMENTS INCLUDING, 

292
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,076
QUOTE, IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL 

293
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:37,877
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES IN 

294
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:38,778
LEGISLATION. 

295
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:39,912
DID YOU MAKE ANY COMMENTS 

296
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,848
REGARDING THE DECEMBER 30th, 

297
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:47,886
2005 SIGNING STATEMENT ON THE 

298
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:48,721
McCAIN TORTURE AMENDMENT, 

299
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,155
INCLUDING POTENTIAL 

300
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,722
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES? 

301
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:53,159
>> I CAN'T RECALL WHAT I SAID. 

302
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,294
I DO RECALL THAT THERE WAS A 

303
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,196
GOOD DEAL OF INTERNAL DEBATE 

304
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,131
ABOUT THAT SIGNING STATEMENT, 

305
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:03,302
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE WOULD 

306
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:03,468
BE. 

307
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:06,439
I REMEMBER THAT IT WAS 

308
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,073
CONTROVERSIAL INTERNALLY, AND I 

309
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,574
REMEMBER THAT I THOUGHT -- AND 

310
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:09,809
I CAN'T REMEMBER ALL THE INS 

311
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,077
AND OUTS OF WHO THOUGHT WHAT, 

312
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,545
BUT I DO REMEMBER THAT THE 

313
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:17,216
COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT WAS IN 

314
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:17,817
CHARGE ULTIMATELY OF SIGNING 

315
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:18,951

316
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,087

00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:21,387
PRESIDENT. 

318
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,123
>> AND JUST A FEW MONTHS LATER

320
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:29,128
NOT INVOLVED IN ANY OF THE 

321
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,463
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RULES 

322
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:31,963
GOVERNING DETENTION OF 

323
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:32,264
COMBATANTS. 

324
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,598
>> SENATOR, AGAIN, WE WERE -- 

325
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:34,767
AT LEAST I UNDERSTOOD IT THEN 

326
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,435
AND I UNDERSTAND IT NOW TO BE 

327
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,737
REFERRING TO THE PROGRAM WE 

328
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,139
WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT WAS 

329
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,942
VERY CONTROVERSIAL THAT SENATOR 

330
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:43,576
FEINSTEIN SPENT YEARS TRYING TO 

331
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,579
DIG INTO, AND I WAS -- I WAS 

332
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:52,952
NOT READ INTO THAT PROGRAM. 

333
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,086
I TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT, 

334
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:54,319
AND -- 

335
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,857
>> LET ME GO TO ANOTHER AREA OF 

336
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,258
QUESTIONING, IF I CAN. 

337
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,459
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,012
EFFORTS TO EXPEDITIOUSLY 

347
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,380
TRANSFER THE IMMIGRATION TO

THAT MOMENTUS LIFE DECISION. 

350
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,950

GOVERNMENT ADDITIONAL TIME TO

IMPOSE AN UNDUE BURDEN, EVEN 

355
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,291
THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT'S CONDUCT 

356
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,126
IN THE CASE HAD ALREADY FORCED 

357
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:37,329
HER TO DELAY HER DECISION ON AN

00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,130

359
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,098

THIS MORNING WE KNOW KAVANAUGH 

373
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,883
WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT HIS VIEWS 

374
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,250
ON ROE V WADE. 

375
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,320
THAT'S OF COURSE THE 1973 

376
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,555
SUPREME COURT DECISION 

377
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,321
LEGALIZING ACCESS TO ABORTION. 

378
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:04,456
KAVANAUGH HAS STATED THAT HIS 

379
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:07,226
VIEWS ON THIS RULING, HE WOULD 

380
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:07,827
CONSIDER AS SETTLED LAW. 

381
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,330
AND HE EXPLAINED THIS AND HIS 

382
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,364
THOUGHTS ON THAT EARLIER TODAY. 

383
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:17,269
>> I SAID THAT IT'S SETTLED AS 

384
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,505
A PRECEDENT OF THE SUPREME 

385
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,040
COURT ENENTITLED THE RESPECT OF 

386
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,640
RESPECTS OF STARRY DECIDESUS 

387
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,008
AND ONE OF THE THINGS TO KEEP 

388
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:27,112
IN MIND ABOUT ROE V WADE IS 

389
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:29,215
THAT IT HAS BEEN REAFFIRMED 

390
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,516
MANY TIMES OVER THE PAST 45 

391
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,183
YEARS, AS YOU KNOW. 

392
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:35,921
AND THIS IS THE POINT I WANT TO 

393
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,656
MAKE THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT. 

394
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:41,327
PLANNED PARENTHOOD VERSUS CASEY 

395
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:45,164
RAFFIRMED ROE AND DID SO BY 

396
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,232
CONSIDERING THE STARRY 

397
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,834
DECIDESUS FACTORS, SO CASEY NOW 

398
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,202
BECOMES A PRECEDENT ON 

399
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:50,502
PRECEDENT. 

400
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:52,404
IT'S NOT AS IF IT'S JUST A RUN-

401
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:56,175
OF-THE-MILL CASE THAT WAS 

402
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,878
DECIDED AND NEVER BEEN 

403
00:12:58,878 --> 00:12:59,678
RECONSIDERED BUT CASEY 

404
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:00,746
SPECIFICALLY RECONSIDERED IT, 

405
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,815
APPLIED THE STARRY DECIDESUS 

406
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,951
FACTORS AND DECIDED TO REAFFIRM 

407
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,285
IT. 

408
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,286
THAT MAKES CASEY A PRECEDENT ON 

409
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:07,586
PRECEDENT. 

410
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,289
>> AND MOLA LENGHI JOINS US NOW 

411
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,358
FROM CAPITOL HILL WITH MORE ON 

412
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:12,857
TODAY'S HEARINGS. 

413
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:14,460
SO YOU HEARD THAT SOUND BITE 

414
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,595
THIS WITH KAVANAUGH REPEATING 

415
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,497
THAT ROE V WADE IS SETTLED LAW. 

416
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,531
IS THAT ENOUGH TO PROVIDE 

417
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:20,933
COMFORT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE 

418
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,802
CONCERNED THAT ABORTION RIGHTS 

419
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,737
COULD BE OVERTURNED IN THE 

420
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:25,204
SUPREME COURT? 

421
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,105
>>REPORTER:  WELL, REENA, 

422
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,172
PROBABLY NOT JUST BECAUSE 

423
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,942
KAVANAUGH NEVER REALLY TOOK A 

424
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:30,209
POSITION. 

425
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,945
YOU KNOW, HE TALKED SORT OF IN 

426
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:33,578
GENERALITIES ABOUT PRECEDENT, 

427
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:34,046
ABOUT SETTLED LAW. 

428
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,215
BUT AS WE HEARD -- AND THERE 

429
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,316
WAS MORE TO THAT THAN THAT 

430
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,951
SOUND BITE, BUT REALLY SAYING 

431
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,120
THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER 

432
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,221
AGAIN AND NEVER REALLY 

433
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,088
ANSWERING SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S 

434
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,324
QUESTION AND ANSWERING EXACTLY 

435
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,425
WHERE HE STANDS ON THE ISSUE. 

436
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,394
IT WAS SENATOR FEINSTEIN WHO 

437
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:52,064
REALLY PROBED HIM ABOUT ROE V 

438
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,433
WADE AND KAVANAUGH'S RESPONSE, 

439
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,202
AGAIN, WAS IT'S SETTLED LAW IT 

440
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,303
IS THE PRECEDENT, IT HAS 

441
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:57,870
ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED. 

442
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,538
AND, YOU KNOW, EVEN WHEN HE WAS 

443
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,073
ASKED BY SENATOR FEINSTEIN, YOU 

444
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,308
KNOW, WELL, WHAT IS YOUR VIEW 

445
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,043
OF SETTLED LAW? 

446
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,278
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE 

447
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,246
OVERTURNED OR, YOU KNOW, CAN IT 

448
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:09,381
BE OVERTURNED OR ANYTHING LIKE 

449
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,582
THAT? 

450
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:12,451
AND HE DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO GO 

451
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,385
DOWN THAT ROAD JUST, AGAIN, 

452
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,855
SAYING THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 

453
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,223
HAS BEEN TESTED AND STOOD FOR 

454
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,091
DECADES, 45 YEARS, AND IT IS 

455
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,025
SETTLED LAW. 

456
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,995
BUT HE SAID ALL THAT WITHOUT 

457
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,431
EVER REALLY GIVING HIS POSITION 

458
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:28,500
ON ROE V WADE OR EVEN ON THE -- 

459
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,868
A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. 

460
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,904
>> YOU KNOW, MOLA, WHEN WE'RE 

461
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:32,972
WATCHING THESE HEARINGS, YOU 

462
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,072
ALWAYS LOOK AT THESE OFF-THE-

463
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:34,639
CUFF MOMENTS AND YESTERDAY 

464
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,674
THERE WAS A BIT OF CONTROVERSY 

465
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,010
WHEN THE FATHER OF A GIRL WHO 

466
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,144
WAS KILLED IN THE PARKLAND 

467
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,112
SHOOTING ACCUSED THE JUDGE OF 

468
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,580
TURNING HIS BACK ON HIM WHEN HE 

469
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,215
ACTUALLY TRIED TO REACH OUT AND 

470
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:43,749
SHAKE HIS HAND. 

471
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,317
WE'VE GOT THIS MOMENT RIGHT 

472
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,685
HERE WITH THE FATHER FROM 

473
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:46,951
PARKLAND. 

474
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:47,853
HOW DID KAVANAUGH RESPOND, AND 

475
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:52,291
HAS THERE BEEN ANYTHING FROM 

476
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,726
HIS TEAM ON THIS? 

477
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,360
>>REPORTER:  NOTHING PUBLICLY. 

478
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,228
YOU KNOW, AND SENATOR LINDSEY 

479
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,663

JUDGE KAVANAUGH, YOU KNOW, SORT 

485
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,476
OF WHAT HE FEELS, WHAT HIS VIEW 

486
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,177
IS ON PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 

487
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:15,080
VICTIMIZED AND THE PEOPLE WHO 

488
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,482
WERE LESS FORTUNATE AND NEEDY. 

489
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,753
AND, YOU KNOW, IN THAT 

490
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,454
QUESTIONING HE BROUGHT UP THE 

491
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,722
PARKLAND FATHER, HE BROUGHT HIM 

492
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,390
UP BY NAME AND SORT OF ASKED,

YOU KNOW, WHAT IS YOUR VIEW OF 

494
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,961
THESE SORT OF THINGS, WHAT IS 

495
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,763
YOUR APPROACH, WHAT IS, YOU

KNOW, YOUR SORT OF LIFE 

497
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:35,267
APPROACH TO THE NEEDY AND TO 

498
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,269
THE LESS FORTUNATE, TO THE LESS 

499
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,170
AMONG US. 

500
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,738
NOW, WHILE SENATOR GRAHAM 

501
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,907
REFERENCED THE PARKLAND FATHER 

502
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,175
BY NAME, IN KAVANAUGH'S, IN 

503
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,043
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S RESPONSE, HE 

504
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,811
NEVER REALLY WENT THERE. ÃºHE DI 

505
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,513
THAT IT WAS BAIT FROM SENATOR 

506
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,248
GRAHAM WHO IS SORT OF A 

507
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,450
SOFTBALL QUESTION FOR HIM, BUT 

508
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,817
HE NEVER WENT THERE. 

509
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:55,087
HE TALKED MORE GENERALLY ABOUT 

510
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,389
HIS VOLUNTEER WORK WITH THE 

511
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,557
HOMELESS AND THROUGH CATHOLIC 

512
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,426
CHARITIES AND HIS GENERAL VIEW 

513
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,628
THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE EQUAL 

514
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,463
REGARDLESS OF THEIR LOT IN LIFE 

515
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,864
AND THAT HE'S NO BETTER THAN A 

516
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:09,134
HOMELESS PERSON ON THE STREET, 

517
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,504
SO SORT OF TALKING ABOUT IT 

518
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,572
GENERALLY BUT NOT TALKING 

519
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,239
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE PARKLAND 

520
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,141
FATHER WHO OBVIOUSLY IS MAKING 

521
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,743
A LOT OF HEADLINES TODAY. 

522
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,479

MUELLER INVESTIGATION, EVERYONE 

524
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,681
IS CURIOUS WHAT KAVANAUGH HAS 

525
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:23,248
TO SAY ABOUT PRESIDENTIAL 

526
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:23,481
POWERS. 

527
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:28,887
I WANT TO PLAY A BITE FOR YOU 

528
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:29,187
ABOUT THIS.

HIMSELF. 

532
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:36,562
DOES HE? 

533
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,763
>> THE QUESTION OF SELF-PARDON 

534
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:40,899
IS SOMETHING I HAVE NEVER 

535
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:41,166
ANALYZED. 

536
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,203
IT'S A QUESTION THAT I'VE NOT 

537
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,573
WRITTEN ABOUT, IT'S A QUESTION 

538
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,974
THEREFORE THAT'S A HYPOTHETICAL 

539
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:49,975
QUESTION, THAT I CAN'T BEGIN TO

00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,243

FROM THAT PERSON THEY WOULDN'T 

547

TESTIFY AGAINST HIM? 

548
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:12,765

ANSWER HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS 

550
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:14,098

00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,003
PRESIDENTIAL POWER, AND DID WE 

554
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:21,005
GET AN INSIDE INTO -- GET AN 

555
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:22,074
INSIGHT INTO KAVANAUGH'S VIEW 

556
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,876
ON THAT? 

557
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,576
>>REPORTER:  WELL, WE DIDN'T 

558
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:25,009
GET ANY INSIGHT. 

559
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:26,711
YOU KNOW, HE -- AS YOU REALLY 

560
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:27,880
HEARD HIM SAY AND THAT'S 

561
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,548
SOMETHING -- AGAIN, ONE OF 

562
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,215
THOSE RESPONSES THAT HE DIDN'T 

563
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,884
REALLY EXPAND ON MUCH, BUT WE 

564
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,852
HEARD A LOT OF THAT SORT OF 

565
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,588
RESPONSE AND THAT WAS THAT HE 

566
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,222
DIDN'T WANT TO ANSWER 

567
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,190
HYPOTHETICALS, THAT HE WASN'T 

568
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,160
GOING TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD AND 

569
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,127
FROM SENATOR LEAHY, AGAIN, HE 

570
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,128
CERTAINLY DIDN'T TAKE THE BAIT, 

571
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,663
SORT OF DISMISSING IT AS A 

572
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,698
HYPOTHETICAL AND THAT JUDGES, 

573
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,867
YOU KNOW, SHOULDN'T GO DOWN 

574
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:49,334
THAT ROAD. 

575
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,070
THIS IS THE DEMOCRATS' ISSUE. 

576
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,270
THIS IS THEIR BIG CONCERN ABOUT 

577
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:52,671
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

578
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,540
YES, THEY HAVE OTHER ISSUES 

579
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,640
LIKE ROE V WADE AND HEALTHCARE 

580
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,077
AND HOW HE MAY COME DOWN ON 

581
00:17:59,077 --> 00:17:59,511
THOSE ISSUES. 

582
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:03,148
BUT THEIR MAIN ISSUE, THE THING 

583
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,184
THAT IS PROBABLY PROMPTING THIS 

584
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,351
STALLING STRATEGY, THIS SORT OF 

585
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,521
STALLING TACTIC THAT WE'VE SEEN 

586
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:13,325
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS IS HOW 

587
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:17,329
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND HOW A 

588
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,229
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE KAVANAUGH 

589
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:18,897
MAY RULE ON PRESIDENTIAL 

590
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,165
PARDONS, ON ALL THINGS -- ALL 

591
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,466
OF THE SORT OF LEGAL ISSUES 

592
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:22,801
THAT ARE CLOUDING OVER THE 

593
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,169
WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW ABOUT 

594
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,203
WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP 

595
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:27,372
ULTIMATELY DECIDES TO FIRE 

596
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,039
SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER, 

597
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,308
WHETHER A PRESIDENT, A SITTING 

598
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,310
PRESIDENT CAN BE INDICTED, 

599
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,713
THESE ARE ALL THE ISSUES THAT 

600
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:35,347
THE DEMOCRATS ARE REALLY 

601
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,116
CONCERNED ABOUT, AND THEIR FEAR 

602
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,519
IS THAT A PRESIDENT WHO MAY 

603
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,288
DOWN THE ROAD BE INDICTED IS 

604
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,123
HAND PICKING THE SUPREME COURT 

605
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:47,959
JUSTICE WHO MAY ULTIMATELY 

606
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:48,626
DECIDE THAT PRESIDENT'S FATE. 

607
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:49,695
AND SO JUDGE KAVANAUGH DIDN'T 

608
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,531
REALLY, YOU KNOW, TAKE A 

609
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,199
POSITION WHERE HE STANDS ON THE 

610
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:54,432
ISSUE. 

611
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:56,168
AND SO DEMOCRATS STILL VERY 

612
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:56,735
CONCERNED BUT ULTIMATELY, 

613
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,237
REENA, THERE'S REALLY NOTHING 

614
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,438
THEY CAN DO AT THIS POINT. 

615
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,941
THEY DO NOT HAVE THE VOTES TO 

616
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:03,474
BLOCK THIS APPOINTMENT. 

617
00:19:03,474 --> 00:19:05,043
AND SO STALLING AND SORT OF 

618
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,211
SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE ISSUE IS 

619
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,213
REALLY ALL THEY CAN DO AT THIS 

620
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,081
POINT. 

621
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,282
>> MOLA LENGHI COMING TO US 

622
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,217

LET'S LISTEN IN. 

629
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,664
>> SO LAWN CUTTING, AND THEN 

630
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,400

631
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,633
SUMMER. 

632
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:31,670
>> MY DIRTIEST JOB I EVER HAD 

633
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,905
WAS FOUR SUMMERS WORKING IN A 

634
00:19:33,905 --> 00:19:34,305
SLAUGHTER HOUSE. 

635
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:34,539
>> YES. 

636
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:36,975
>> I ALWAYS WANTED TO GO BACK 

637
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:37,308
TO COLLEGE. 

638
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:41,846
COULDN'T WAIT TO GET OUT OF 

639
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:42,213
THERE. 

640
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,115
IT WAS UNBEARABLE. 

641
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,516
IT WAS DIRTY, IT WAS HOT, 

642
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,518
THINGS I DID UNIMAGINABLE, AND 

643
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,088
I WON'T EVEN START TO REPEAT 

644
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,156
THEM. 

645
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:54,459
THEN CAME A CASE BEFORE YOU 

646
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,293
CALLED AGRI PROCESSOR COMPANY 

647
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:56,028
VERSUS N.O.R.B. 

648
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,730
AT LEAST 1/3 OF THE WORKERS, 

649
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,201
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, IN OUR 

650
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,903
NATION'S SLAUGHTER HOUSES ARE 

651
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:05,203
IMMIGRANTS. 

652
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:06,038

STINKING HOT JOBS. 

658
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,382
MANY OF THEM ARE UNDOCUMENTED. 

659
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,452
THE WORK IS LOW PAID AND 

660
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:20,752
DANGEROUS. 

661
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:21,653
AND AS THE G.A.O.s NOTED, 

662
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:25,157
IMMIGRANTS ARE PRESSURED TO NOT 

663
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,392
EVEN REPORT INJURIES ON THE 

664
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:27,659

00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:43,408
WAS COMMUTED BY PRESIDENT 

672
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:43,641
TRUMP. 

673
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:45,243
AGRI-PROCESSORS HAD AT THE CORE 

674
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:47,679
OF ITS BUSINESS MODEL THE 

675
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,413
EXPLOITATION OF UNDOCUMENTED

EVERY WORD OF STATUTE. 

735
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:35,553
>> YES. 

736
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:37,289
>> SO WHY DID YOU GO OUT OF 

737
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,325
YOUR WAY TO INTERPRET THE WORD 

738
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,928
EMPLOYEE IN A WAY THAT 

739
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:43,595
BENEFITED THIS HORRIBLE 

740
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:44,362
BUSINESS AND DISADVANTAGED 

741
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:44,895
THESE EXPLOITED WORKERS? 

742
00:22:44,895 --> 00:22:47,399
WHY DIDN'T YOU STICK TO THE 

743
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,802
PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE 

744
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,003
CONTROLLING STATUTE AND THE 

745
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:52,470
BINDING SUPREME COURT 

746
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:52,770
PRECEDENT? 

747
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,371
>> BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT 

748
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,240
PRECEDENT COMPELLED ME TO REACH 

749
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,209
THE RESULT THAT I REACHED, AND 

750
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:57,676
HERE'S WHY, SENATOR. 

751
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,277
LET ME EXPLAIN. 

752
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:04,149
THE SUPREME COURT HAD A CASE IN 

753
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,384
1984 CALLED THE SHIRRTAN 

754
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:06,651
DECISION. 

755
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,720
AND THE SHIRRTAN DECISION 

756
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,055
CONSIDERED THE INTERACTION OF 

757
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,257
THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS 

758
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:15,427
LAW ACT AND THE IMMIGRATION 

759
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:15,627
LAWS. 

760
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:20,232
AND WHAT THE SUPREME COURT DID 

761
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,833
IN SHIRTAN IS HAD THIS QUESTION 

762
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,269
AND SAID IT IS AT THAT TIME 

763
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:24,970
PERMISSIBLE TO CONSIDER AN 

764
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,105
IMMIGRANT UNLAWFULLY IN THE 

765
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,174
COUNTRY AS AN EMPLOYEE UNDER 

766
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:29,774
THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS 

767
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:31,476
ACT, AND IN PART 2B OF THE 

768
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,210
OPINION, YOU HAVE TO READ PART 

769
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,579
2B OF THE OPINION, THE SUPREME 

770
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,046
COURT'S OPINION. 

771
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,015
IF YOU READ THAT PART OF THE 

772
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:40,452
OPINION, THE COURT THEN GOES ON 

773
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,454
TO SAY AND BECAUSE THE 

774
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,623
IMMIGRATION LAWS DO NOT 

775
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:45,390
PROHIBIT EMPLOYMENT OF PEOPLE 

776
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,524
UNLAWFULLY IN THE COUNTRY. 

777
00:23:46,524 --> 00:23:47,725
IT MAKES CLEAR -- THE SUPREME 

778
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:49,794
COURT MAKES CLEAR THIS IS WHEN 

779
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,096
IT'S BEING CONSIDERED IN 

780
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,864
CONGRESS IN '84, IT ENDS UP IN 

781
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:53,698
THE '86 ACT. 

782
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,534
THE COURT MAKES CLEAR AS I READ 

783
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,669
PART 2B AND I THINK I'M CORRECT 

784
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,371
ON THIS, IS THAT IF THE 

785
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,772
IMMIGRATION LAWS DID PROHIBIT 

786
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:01,606
EMPLOYMENT OF SOMEONE HERE 

787
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,475
UNLAWFULLY IN THE COUNTRY, THEN 

788
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,675
THAT WOULD ALSO MEAN THAT THEY 

789
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:05,977
CAN'T VOTE IN THE UNION 

790
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:06,244
ELECTION. 

791
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,679
SO WHAT I WAS DOING THERE, 

792
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:09,548
SENATOR, IT'S ALL ABOUT 

793
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:09,848
PRECEDENT. 

794
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,550
I READ THAT -- AND MY OPINION, 

795
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,518
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DISSENTING 

796
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,487
OPINION, I REALLY PARSED THIS 

797
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,589
VERY CAREFULLY, AND I WENT DEEP 

798
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:18,223
INTO THIS CASE. 

799
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:22,327
SO I WENT BACK AND PULLED -- 

800
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,329
FROM THE SHIRTAN CASE, I LOOKED 

801
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,230
AT THE MARSHAL PAPERS FROM THE 

802
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,098
LIBRARY TO READ ALL THE MEMOS 

803
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,834
THAT WENT BACK AND FORTH IN THE 

804
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:30,602
JUSTICES IN THE SHIRTAN CASE. 

805
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,037
I CITED THE ORAL ARGUMENT TO 

806
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,972
MAKE SURE THAT WHAT I WAS 

807
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,039
READING IN THERE WAS ACTUALLY 

808
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,508
REFLECTED WHAT HAD BEEN GOING 

809
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,375
ON IN THE SUPREME COURT. 

810
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,177
AND IT IS QUITE CLEAR FROM THE 

811
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,279
ORAL ARGUMENT THEY WERE AWARE 

812
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,581
THAT THE IMMIGRATION LAW WAS 

813
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:43,882
ABOUT TO BE CHANGED AND THEY 

814
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:44,916
WERE AWARE OF THE INTERACTION 

815
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:48,119
BETWEEN THE LABOR LAW AND THE 

816
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:48,587
IMMIGRATION LAW. 

817
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,122
SO I THINK -- I STAND BY WHAT I 

818
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,224
WROTE THEN, AND I THINK I 

819
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:55,527
CORRECTLY ANALYZED PART 2B. 

820
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:55,927
NOW, SENATOR -- 

821
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:58,830
>> I HAVE TO -- WE'RE RUNNING 

822
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,798
OUT OF TIME HERE. 

823
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,801
>> IF THE SUPREME COURT SHIRTAN 

824
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,336
OPINION HAD ENDED AT PART 2A, 

825
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,538
100% WOULD AGREE WITH YOU AND 

826
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,205
MY DECISION WOULD HAVE BEEN 

827
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:07,505
DIFFERENT. 

828
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,607
>> WELL, LET ME -- 

829
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,741
>> IF YOU READ PART 2B -- 

830
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:10,942
>> YOU SAID EARLIER TODAY YOU 

831
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:14,646
DON'T GET TO PICK AND CHOOSE 

832
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,081
WHICH SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT 

833
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:16,547
YOU FOLLOW. 

834
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:17,983
THE MAJORITY IN AGRI 

835
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,184
PROCESSOR'S CASE WAS FOLLOWING 

836
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,785
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT. 

837
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,221
IN THE SHIRTAN CASE, THE 

838
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,756
SUPREME COURT, A 7-2 DECISION 

839
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,092
SAID THAT UNDOCUMENTED 

840
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,326
IMMIGRANTS ARE EMPLOYEES UNDER 

841
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,728
THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS 

842
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:29,928
ACT. 

843
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,529
I QUOTE, SINCE UNDOCUMENTED 

844
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,532
ALIENS ARE NOT AMONG THE FEW 

845
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,866
GROUPS OF WORKERS EXPRESSLY 

846
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:37,035
EXEMPTED BY CONGRESS, THEY 

847
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,069
PLAINLY COME WITHIN THE BROAD 

848
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,004
STATUTORY DEFINITION OF 

849
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,939
EMPLOYEE, THAT'S A QUOTE FROM 

850
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:41,206
THE CASE. 

851
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,307
>> THAT'S PART 2B. 

852
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,641
YOU GOTTA GO TO PART 2B. 

853
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:45,210
>> LET ME HANG ON. 

854
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,545
LET ME TELL YOU SOME PEOPLE WHO 

855
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,013
WENT TO BOTHER PARTS AND 

856
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:52,851
COULDN'T DIS -- BOTH PARTS AND 

857
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:53,351
COULDN'T DISAGREE MORE. 

858
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,220
THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE, 

859
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,921
THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS 

860
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:58,923
BOARD, INCLUDING REPUBLICAN 

861
00:25:58,923 --> 00:25:59,824
APPOINTEES, TWO APPEALS COURT 

862
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:00,291
JUDGES, INCLUDING ONE 

863
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:00,992
REPUBLICAN APPOINTEE FOLLOWED 

864
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,827
THE SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT AND 

865
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,262
CAME TO THE OPPOSITE CONCLUSION 

866
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,064
THAT YOU DID. 

867
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,265
I UNDERSTAND YOU MAY HAVE 

868
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:08,533
PREFERRED THE SHIRTAN DISSENT, 

869
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,235
BUT YOU FAILED TO FOLLOW 

870
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:10,768
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT. 

871
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:14,239
THIS WAS A CASE WHERE THE 

872
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,074
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT 

873
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:16,841
INCLUDED THOSE WHO WERE 

874
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,076
UNDOCUMENTED WHO COULD UNIONIZE 

875
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,010
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES IN THE 

876
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:19,510
WORK PLACE. 

877
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,212
YOU WENT OUT OF YOUR WAY TO 

878
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,014
DISSENT ALL THE WAY ALONG AND 

879
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,616
MAKE SURE THEY DIDN'T EARN IN 

880
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,117
YOUR VIEW NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT, 

881
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:29,320
THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE THAT 

882
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,087
RIGHT TO UNIONIZE. 

883
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:32,457
>> I VERY RESPECTFULLY 

884
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,024
DISAGREE, SENATOR. 

885
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,827
AND THE REASON I DISAGREE IS 

886
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,796
THAT THE SUPREME COURT DID SAY 

887
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,432
THAT THE IMMIGRANT WAS COVERED 

888
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:40,965
UNDER THE DEFINITION OF 

889
00:26:40,965 --> 00:26:41,232
N.L.R.A. 

890
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,201
IF IT ENDS THERE, I'M WITH YOU 

891
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:43,401
100%. 

892
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,804
BUT THEN THE SUPREME COURT GOES 

893
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,573
ON TO SAY, AND WE CONSIDER ALSO 

894
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,075
IN RESOLVING THIS QUESTION THE 

895
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,143
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE NATIONAL 

896
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,244
LABOR RELATIONS ACT AND THE 

897
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:53,745
IMMIGRATION LAWS. 

898
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,780
IT MAKES CLEAR, AS I READ IT, 

899
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,984
IF THE IMMIGRATION LAWS HAD 

900
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,418
MADE EMPLOYMENT OF SOMEONE HERE 

901
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:00,951
IN THE COUNTRY UNLAWFULLY 

902
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:02,320
ILLEGAL, THEN THAT WOULD BE 

903
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,587
PROHIBITED IN THE CASE. 

904
00:27:03,587 --> 00:27:05,056
AND I WENT BACK, LIKE I SAID -- 

905
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,692
IF YOU LOOK AT JUSTICE -- I 

906
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:11,463
MEAN, I QUOTE THE ORAL ARGUMENT 

907
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,463
TRANSCRIPT FROM SHIRTAN IN MY 

908
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:13,364
DISSENTING OPINION. 

909
00:27:13,364 --> 00:27:16,835
AND, LOOK, I HAD NO -- I HAVE 

910
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,937
NO AGENDA IN ANY DIRECTION ON 

911
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:19,771
THE -- I'M A JUDGE. 

912
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,373
SO I'M JUST TRYING  TO RESOLVE 

913
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:21,740
THE PRECEDENT. 

914
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,509
>> LET ME JUST CLOSE -- LET ME 

915
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:25,343
CLOSE BY SAYING THIS. 

916
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,645
I'M JUST A JUDGE, I JUST FOLLOW 

917
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:27,945
PRECEDENT. 

918
00:27:27,945 --> 00:27:28,880
GOSH, WE'VE HEARD THAT SO 

919
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,181
OFTEN, AND I HOPE IT'S THE 

920
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:30,482
CASE. 

921
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,417
BUT WE KNOW THERE'S MUCH MORE 

922
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,251
TO YOUR JOB THAN THAT. 

923
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,687
>> I AGREE. 

924
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,022
>> THE FACT THAT YOU WERE A 

925
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:37,856
DISSENTER AND EVERYONE ELSE SAW 

926
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,425
THIS THE OTHER WAY SHOULD GIVE 

927
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:43,761
US PAUSE WHEN YOU SAY I'M JUST 

928
00:27:43,761 --> 00:27:44,262
FOLLOWING PRECEDENT. 

929
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:45,196
>> WELL, I RESPECTFULLY, 

930
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,264
SENATOR -- THAT OPINION, I'M 

931
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,501
PROUD OF THAT OPINION BECAUSE I 

932
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,401
THINK IT CAREFULLY DETAILS THE 

933
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:52,303
LAW IN THAT CASE, I'M FOLLOWING 

934
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,838
THE SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT. 

935
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,040
AND TO YOUR POINT THAT OTHER 

936
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,208
JUDGES DISAGREE, I'LL JUST -- 

937
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:01,513
THERE WAS A CASE I HAD ABOUT 10 

938
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,413
YEARS AGO OR EIGHT YEARS AGO 

939
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:03,782
CALLED PAPANYO, A CASE WHERE I 

940
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,251
RULED IN FAVOR OF A CRIMINAL 

941
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,086
DEFENDANT ON A RESTITUTION 

942
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:08,319
MATTER. 

943
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,020
EVERY OTHER COURT BEFOREHAND 

944
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,320
DISAGREED. 

945
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,855
I WROTE THE MAJORITY OPINION 

946
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,024
WITH JUDGE EDWARDS AND JUDGE 

947
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:13,291
GRIFFITH. 

948
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:13,858
EVERY OTHER COURT AFTER US 

949
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,159
DISAGREED. 

950
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,594
FINALLY WE GOT TO THE SUPREME 

951
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,264
COURT THIS YEAR IN THE LAGOS 

952
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:22,867
CASE AND THEY AGREED WITH OUR 

953
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,468
ONE OPINION, THE PAPANYO 

954
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:24,636
OPINION. 

955
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,105
JUST TO POINT OUT, THAT JUST 

956
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,207
BECAUSE OTHER COURTS OF APPEALS 

957
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,009
MIGHT HAVE DISAGREED DOES NOT 

958
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:31,676
NECESSARILY MEAN WE WERE 

959
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,144
NECESSARILY WRONG PAUSE THE 

960
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,612
SUPREME COURT ULTIMATELY 

961
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:34,979
DECIDES THAT. 

962
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:38,116
I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION, AND 

963
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:38,616
I APPRECIATE THEM. 

964
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:38,916
THANK YOU. 

965
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:41,219
>> SENATOR CORNYN AND SENATOR 

966
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:46,224
LEE IS GOING TO CHAIR WHILE I 

967
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:46,791
HAVE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT. 

968
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:47,058
SENATOR. 

969
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,726
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

970
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:49,327
MR. CHAIRMAN, I WAS GRATEFUL 

971
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,061
THAT TODAY'S HEARING AT LEAST 

972
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:54,265
AS FAR AS THE COMMITTEE IS 

973
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,768
CONCERNED IS A LOT MORE 

974
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:57,535
DIGNIFIED AND CIVIL, BUT 

975
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,671
UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THE HIGH 

976
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:00,872
JINX CONTINUE EVEN ON THE 

977
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,307
SENATE FLOOR. 

978
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,641
I KNOW SENATOR MCCONNELL HAS 

979
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,176
CONCEPT FOR THE JUDICIARY 

980
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:10,081
COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE MEETING 

981
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,148
DURING THIS DAY'S OF THE 

982
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:11,415
SESSION. 

983
00:29:11,415 --> 00:29:12,183
SENATOR SCHUMER OBJECTED, SO 

984
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:13,718
SENATOR MCCONNELL WAS LEFT WITH 

985
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:17,322
NO OPTION OTHER THAN ADJOURN 

986
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:20,024
THE SENATE AND ALLOW THE 

987
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:20,758
COMMITTEE CONTINUE TO MEET. 

988
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:22,126
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE. 

989
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:24,229
SO, JUDGE, I BELIEVE WE MET IN 

990
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:24,695
THE YEAR 2000. 

991
00:29:24,695 --> 00:29:24,929
>> YES. 

992
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,232
>> AND JUST TO TAKE A LITTLE 

993
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:27,932
WALK DOWN MEMORY LANE HERE, 

994
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,600
WHEN I WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF 

995
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,568
TEXAS AND HAD A CHANCE TO ARGUE 

996
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:35,440
A CASE IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME 

997
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,243
COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, 

998
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,612
YOU, TED OLSON AND TED KRIMENT, 

999
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,312
I BELIEVE, HELPED ME GET READY. 

1000
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:46,217
I REGRET YOU DIDN'T HAVE BETTER 

1001
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,786
MATERIAL TO WORK WITH. 

1002
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,988
>> IT WAS AN HONOR, SENATOR. 

1003
00:29:50,988 --> 00:29:53,324
>> WELL, IT WAS A GREAT 

1004
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:54,225
EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATIONAL 

1005
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,561
EXPERIENCE, BUT I GOT TO 

1006
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,328
APPRECIATE YOUR SKILLS AS A 

1007
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:57,562
LAWYER. 

1008
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:58,129
>> THANK YOU. 

1009
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,298
>> FROM THAT TIME AND HAVE 

1010
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,700
FOLLOWED YOUR CAREER CLOSELY 

1011
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,003
SINCE, AND I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT 

1012
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,437
YOUR NOMINATION BASED ON MY 

1013
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:07,705
PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR 

1014
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:08,473
SKILLS, YOUR TEMPERMENT AND 

1015
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,842
YOUR CHARACTER AND YOUR 

1016
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,110
FIDELITY TO THE RULE OF LAW. 

1017
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,679
BUT I DO WANT TO PICK ONE BONE 

1018
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:14,946
WITH YOU. 

1019
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:18,950
I DID THIS -- THIS ISN'T UNIQUE 

1020
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,183
TO YOU. 

1021
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:21,052
BASED ON THAT EXPERIENCE, THAT 

1022
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,788
CASE, AS YOU MAY RECALL, 

1023
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,323
INVOLVED IS TRADITION IN THE 

1024
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:25,957
SANTA FE INDEPENDENT SCHOOL 

1025
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:26,524
DISTRICT UNFORTUNATELY WHICH 

1026
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,226
ÃºW 

1027
00:30:29,226 --> 00:30:31,462
IN MORE RECENT DAYS, BUT BACK 

1028
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,196
THEN THE PRACTICE BEFORE 

1029
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:34,732
FOOTBALL GAMES WAS THAT THE 

1030
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,768
STUDENTS WOULD BE ABLE TO 

1031
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,503
VOLUNTEER TO OFFER A PRAYER 

1032
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,871
BEFORE THE FOOTBALL GAME. 

1033
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,605
THEY WEREN'T REQUIRED TO DO SO. 

1034
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:42,740
THE SCHOOL DIDN'T PICK THEM. 

1035
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,108
THEY COULD OFFER AN 

1036
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,543
INSPIRATIONAL SAYING OR READ A 

1037
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:49,347
POEM OR ANYTHING ELSE. 

1038
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,014
BUT THAT WAS THE PRACTICE. 

1039
00:30:51,014 --> 00:30:51,582
WELL, UNTIL THE A.C.L.U. 

1040
00:30:51,582 --> 00:30:53,918
FILED SUIT, AND UNFORTUNATELY 

1041
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:56,688
IT WAS HELD TO BE 

1042
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,322
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, IN VIOLATION 

1043
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,157
OF THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE. 

1044
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,226
I'M NOT GOING TO ASK FOR YOUR 

1045
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,293
OPINIONS BECAUSE THIS ISSUE 

1046
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,929
WILL LIKELY COME BACK BEFORE 

1047
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:05,429
THE COURT, BUT SINCE I 

1048
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:07,598
MENTIONED IT TO JUSTICE 

1049
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:10,435
GORSUCH, I'M GOING TO MENTION 

1050
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:10,868
IT TO YOU. 

1051
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:12,971
THE THING THAT IS STUCK IN MY 

1052
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:19,110
CRAWL FOR THE LAST 18 YEARS IS 

1053
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,145
THE DISSENT WRITTEN BY CHIEF 

1054
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,380
JUSTICE RENQUIST WHICH TAKES 

1055
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,649
EXCEPTION TO THE MAJORITY'S 

1056
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,484
DECISION SAYING THEY DISTORTED 

1057
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:27,185
EXISTING PRECEDENT. 

1058
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,620
BUT HE GOES ON TO SAY EVEN MORE 

1059
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:36,194
DISTURBING THAN ITS HOLDING IS 

1060
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:39,063
THE TONE OF THE COURT'S 

1061
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:39,330
OPINION. 

1062
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,398
IT BRIFTLES WITH HOSTILITY TO 

1063
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,766
ALL THINGS RELIGIOUS IN PUBLIC 

1064
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:41,966
LIFE. 

1065
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,034
NEITHER THE HOLDING NOR THE 

1066
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,470
TONE OR THE OPINION IS FAITHFUL 

1067
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,574
TO THE MEANING OF THE 

1068
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,074
ESTABLISHMENT CLAWTION. 

1069
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:50,741
WHEN IT IS RECALLED THAT GEORGE 

1070
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:51,676
WASHINGTON'S -- THAT GEORGE 

1071
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:52,977
WASHINGTON HIMSELF AT THE 

1072
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,378
REQUEST OF THE VERY CONGRESS 

1073
00:31:54,378 --> 00:31:58,082
WHICH PASSED THE BILL OF RIGHTS 

1074
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,651
PROCLAIMED A DAY OF PUBLIC 

1075
00:32:00,651 --> 00:32:03,755
THANKSGIVING AND PRAYER TO BE 

1076
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,756
OBSERVED BY ACKNOWLEDGING WITH 

1077
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,925
GRATEFUL HEARTS THE MANY AND 

1078
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:09,927
SIGNALED FAVORS OF THE ALMIGHTY 

1079
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:10,127
GOD. 

1080
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:12,430
SINCE I HAD YOU HERE I THOUGHT 

1081
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,097
I'D MENTION THAT. 

1082
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,133
I'M NOT ASKING FOR YOUR OPINION 

1083
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,268
SINCE LIKELY YOU'LL BE CALLED 

1084
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,270
UPON TO DECIDE CASES INVOLVING 

1085
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,472
THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN THE 

1086
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:21,939
FUTURE. 

1087
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,508
BUT SINCE WE HAD THAT HISTORY 

1088
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:23,774
TOGETHER. 

1089
00:32:23,774 --> 00:32:24,008
>> YES. 

1090
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:26,844
>> I THOUGHT I WOULD TELL YOU 

1091
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:33,684
IT STILL STICKS IN MY CRAWL. 

1092
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:35,520
>> I UNDERSTAND, SENATOR. 

1093
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,789
WE REMEMBER CERTAINLY CASES I 

1094
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:37,989
LOST. 

1095
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:38,289
I REMEMBER. 

1096
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,791
THEY STILL STICK IN MY CRAWL 

1097
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,124
TOO, SENATOR. 

1098
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,194
>> I JUST MARVEL THAT UNDER THE 

1099
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,862
FIRST AMENDMENT WE CAN -- A 

1100
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,364
VARIETY OF VOICES CAN SPEAK, 

1101
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:49,267
AND THAT'S GENERALLY A GOOD 

1102
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,635
THING, BUT IT CAN BE ABOUT 

1103
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,804
VIOLENCE, SEXISM, IT CAN BE 

1104
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,806
ABOUT ALMOST ANYTHING, BUT YOU 

1105
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,140
CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT RELIGION IN A 

1106
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,473
PUBLIC FORUM. 

1107
00:32:56,473 --> 00:32:58,576
>> WELL, THERE HAVE BEEN -- YOU 

1108
00:32:58,576 --> 00:32:59,610
KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN CASES 

1109
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:03,181
FROM THE SUPREME COURT I THINK 

1110
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,582
IN MORE RECENT YEARS, CASES 

1111
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:07,785
LIKE THE GOOD NEWS CLUB CASE, 

1112
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:11,556
CASES LIKE THE TRINITY LUTHERAN 

1113
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,423
CASE, CASES LIKE THE TOWN OF 

1114
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:15,760
GREECE CASE WHERE I THINK THE 

1115
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,694
SUPREME COURT HAS RECOGNIZED 

1116
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:18,096
THE IMPORTANCE OF COURSE OF 

1117
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,564
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IN THE UNITED 

1118
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:25,002
STATES, AND ALSO IS RECOGNIZED 

1119
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:26,570
I THINK THAT RELIGIOUS 

1120
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,073
SPEAKERS, RELIGIOUS PEOPLE, 

1121
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,407
RELIGIOUS SPEECH IS ENTITLED TO 

1122
00:33:30,407 --> 00:33:32,110
A SPACE IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE 

1123
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,677
AND NOT TO BE DISCRIMINATED 

1124
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:33,944
AGAINST. 

1125
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:35,746
SO I THINK THE TRINITY LUTHERAN 

1126
00:33:35,746 --> 00:33:38,015
CASE IS AN IMPORTANT ONE ON 

1127
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:38,282
THAT. 

1128
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,152
THE GOOD NEWS CLUB CASE, THAT'S 

1129
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,187
A CASE WHERE AS AN AFTER SCHOOL 

1130
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,722
PROGRAM AT A SCHOOL, SCHOOL 

1131
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,757
GYM, I THINK, OR AUDITORIUM AND 

1132
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:47,758
A RELIGIOUS GROUP WAS EXCLUDED 

1133
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:50,228
AND THE SUPREME COURT MADE 

1134
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,662
CLEAR, NO, YOU CAN'T JUST 

1135
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:52,262
EXCLUDE THE RELIGIOUS GROUP. 

1136
00:33:52,262 --> 00:33:54,465
SO I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN SOME 

1137
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:55,366
DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THEN IN 

1138
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:59,036
TERMS OF RELIGIOUS EQUALITY AND 

1139
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:00,971
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY THAT ARE 

1140
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:01,272
IMPORTANT. 

1141
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:02,607
TOSE CASES ARE ALWAYS 

1142
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:03,775
DIFFICULT FACTUALLY, BUT THE 

1143
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,376
PRINCIPLE YOU'RE ESPOUSING I DO 

1144
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,278
THINK IS REFLECTIVE IN SOME 

1145
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,545
MORE RECENT SUPREME COURT 

1146
00:34:08,545 --> 00:34:08,846
PRECEDENT. 

1147
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:09,914
>> I'LL JUST CONCLUDE WITH 

1148
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:10,114
THIS. 

1149
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:12,949
AS I UNDERSTAND THE 

1150
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,385
CONSTITUTION, IT REQUIRES A 

1151
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,821
GOVERNMENT TO BE NEUTRAL AND AS 

1152
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,589
CHIEF JUSTICE RENQUIST I THINK 

1153
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:19,389
IN THIS CASE THE GOVERNMENT 

1154
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,192
EVIDENCED HOSTILITY TO 

1155
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,860
RELIGIOUS SPEECH IN THE PUBLIC 

1156
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,092
SQUARE. 

1157
00:34:23,092 --> 00:34:25,029
THAT'S JUST ONE PERSON'S 

1158
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,297
OPINION, AND, AGAIN, I'M NOT 

1159
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:28,532
ASKING YOU FOR ANY OPINION WITH 

1160
00:34:28,532 --> 00:34:33,170
REGARD TO -- [ CROWD NOISE  ] 

1161
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:39,243
>> THAT MAY COME BEFORE THE 

1162
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:39,476
COURT. 

1163
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:54,592
[ CROWD NOISE  ] 

1164
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,594
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I HOPE THAT 

1165
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,362
TIME WON'T BE SUBTRACTED FROM 

1166
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,030
MY 30 MINUTES. 

1167
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,732
>> IT WILL NOT BE. 

1168
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:02,400
>> THANK YOU. 

1169
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:02,900
SO JUDGE KAVANAUGH, I'M 

1170
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,336
INTRIGUED BY A COMMENT THAT YOU 

1171
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,338
MADE EARLIER ABOUT THE ROL OF 

1172
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:07,638
PRECEDENT. 

1173
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:09,673
WE'VE -- THE ROLE OF PRECEDENT. 

1174
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:10,374
WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT 

1175
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:10,674
PRECEDENT. 

1176
00:35:10,674 --> 00:35:13,678
YOU ALLUDED TO THIS BOOK THAT 

1177
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,479
YOU AND OTHER JUDGES WROTE WITH 

1178
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:19,383
BRIAN GARNER ON THE LAW OF 

1179
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:19,816
JUDICIAL PRECEDENT. 

1180
00:35:19,816 --> 00:35:20,484
I CHECKED IT OUT. 

1181
00:35:20,484 --> 00:35:20,951
IT'S 900 PAGES LONG. 

1182
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:22,553
AND I HAVEN'T READ EVERY PAGE 

1183
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:22,886
OF IT EITHER. 

1184
00:35:22,886 --> 00:35:24,555
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S MEANT -- 

1185
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,691
IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE READ WORD 

1186
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:26,958
FOR WORD. 

1187
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,025
IT'S A TREATISE WHERE YOU GO TO 

1188
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,760
A SECTION THAT MIGHT BE ON 

1189
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,227
POINT OR SOMETHING. 

1190
00:35:30,227 --> 00:35:32,530
>> BUT LET ME JUST ASK YOU A 

1191
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,998
MORE BASIC QUESTION AND THEN WE 

1192
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:35,566
CAN WORK OUR WAY INTO THAT. 

1193
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:38,002
SHOULD -- WHEN PEOPLE GO TO 

1194
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,938
COURT, SHOULD THEY EXPECT A 

1195
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,273
DIFFERENT OUTCOME THAT THE 

1196
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:43,374
JUDGE WAS NOMINATED BY A 

1197
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:46,077
REPUBLICAN FROM A COURT WHERE 

1198
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:50,715
THE JUDGE WAS NOMINATED BY A 

1199
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:50,982
DEMOCRAT? 

1200
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,282
>> NO. 

1201
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,452
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE 

1202
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,687
OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND 

1203
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,090
THE JUDICIAL ROLE WHERE THE 

1204
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,825
JUDGE'S UMPIRE VISION, THAT 

1205
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,859
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS 

1206
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:02,793
ARTICULATED AND I'VE TALKED 

1207
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:03,894
ABOUT MANY TIMES PUBLICLY IS 

1208
00:36:03,894 --> 00:36:04,328
CRITICAL. 

1209
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,696
WHEN YOU GO TO A BASEBALL GAME, 

1210
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,298
THE UMPIRE IS NOT WEARING THE 

1211
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:10,468
UNIFORM OF ONE TEAM OR ANOTHER, 

1212
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:11,868
AND THAT'S A CRITICAL 

1213
00:36:11,868 --> 00:36:12,169
PRINCIPLE. 

1214
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:15,739
>> WELL, IT STRIKES ME AS AN 

1215
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:16,507
IMPORTANT POINT GIVEN THE 

1216
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,643
SUGGESTION THAT ONE OF THE 

1217
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:19,243
REASONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE 

1218
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:20,244
OBJECTED TO YOUR NOMINATION IS 

1219
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:23,748
I BELIEVE THE QUOTE IS YOU HAD 

1220
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:24,982
REPUBLICAN BLOOD FLOWING IN 

1221
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,183
YOUR VEINS, STRIKES ME AS A 

1222
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:27,251
STRANGE AND BIZARRE STATEMENT. 

1223
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:30,021
>> I'VE BEEN A JUDGE FOR 12 

1224
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,155
YEARS, SENATOR, AND I'M 307 

1225
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,291
OPINION, I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT 

1226
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,192
RECORD AND BEEN AN INDEPENDENT 

1227
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:36,460
JUDGE FOR 12 YEARS. 

1228
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,029
AS A JUDGE, YOU'RE NOT A 

1229
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,598
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT AS A 

1230
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:40,965
FEDERAL JUDGE. 

1231
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,534
>> AND YOU TALKED ABOUT -- A 

1232
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,237
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE 

1233
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,272
CONSTITUTIONAL BASIS FOR A 

1234
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,307
JUDGE'S OBLIGATION TO APPLY 

1235
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,942
COULD YOU EXPAND ON THAT A 

1236
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:51,575
LITTLE BIT MORE? 

1237
00:36:51,575 --> 00:36:53,211
BECAUSE I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE 

1238
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,445
UNDER THE IMPRESSION THIS IS 

1239
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,781
SORT OF A DISCRETIONARY MATTER 

1240
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,416
AND YOU CAN SORT OF CHERRY PICK 

1241
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,084
BETWEEN WHAT PRECEDENTS YOU 

1242
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,653
DECIDE TO FOLLOW AND WHICH ONES 

1243
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:03,220
YOU DON'T FOLLOW. 

1244
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,122
>> WELL, THERE'S BEEN A DEBATE 

1245
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:08,392
SOMETIMES ABOUT WHAT ARE THE 

1246
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:12,329
ORIGINS OF PRECEDENT, WHY DO 

1247
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:13,230
YOU FOLLOW PRECEDENT, AND AS I 

1248
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:19,904
SEE IT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF 

1249
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,871
REASONS YOU WOULD CITE, 

1250
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,974
STABILITY, PREDICTABILITY, 

1251
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,508
IMPARTIALALITY, RELIANCE 

1252
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:26,010
INTEREST, BUT ALL OF THOSE ARE 

1253
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,344
NOT MERE POLICIES IN MY VIEW. 

1254
00:37:27,344 --> 00:37:30,047
AS I SEE IT, THE SYSTEM OF 

1255
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,617
PRECEDENT COMES FROM ARTICLE 3 

1256
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:32,850
ITSELF. 

1257
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,885
WHEN ARTICLE 3 REFERS TO THE 

1258
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:37,221
JUDICIAL POWER SHALL BE VESTED 

1259
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:42,526
IN ONE SUPREME COURT AND SUCH 

1260
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:43,261
INFERIOR COURTS AS CONGRESS 

1261
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,528
SHALL FROM TIME TO TIME 

1262
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,731
ESTABLISH, TO MY MIND, THE 

1263
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:47,698
PHRASE JUDICIAL POWER, YOU 

1264
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:52,536
THINK ABOUT WHAT DOES THAT 

1265
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:52,770
ENTAIL. 

1266
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,571
AND YOU LOOK AT THE MEANING, 

1267
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:54,972
THE MEANING AT THE TIME OF 

1268
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:58,476
JUDICIAL POWER AND YOU LOOK AT 

1269
00:37:58,476 --> 00:37:59,310
ONE SOURCE, THE FEDERALIST OF 

1270
00:37:59,310 --> 00:37:59,476
78. 

1271
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:01,278
IN THE FEDERALIST OF 78 IT'S 

1272
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:03,881
WELL EXPLAINED THAT JUDGES MAKE 

1273
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,417
DECISIONS BASED ON PRECEDENT, 

1274
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,586
AND PRECEDENT THEREFORE, AS I 

1275
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,454
READ JUDICIAL POWER, HAS 

1276

JUDGES, UNLIKE LEGISLATORS 

1282
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,166
DON'T RUN FOR ELECTION. 

1283

YOU DON'T HAVE A PLATFORM. 

1284
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:23,400

00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,408
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 

1288
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,042
ELEMENTS OF THE -- OF LIMITING 

1289
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:35,079
THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF JUDGES I 

1290
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:35,746
THINK UNDER THE CONSTITUTION IS 

1291
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,849
THAT YOU'RE REQUIRED TO DECIDE 

1292
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:43,187
A CASE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS 

1293
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:44,021
RATHER THAN ISSUING SOME SORT 

1294
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,457
OF OR ACLE SAYING HENCEFORTH, 

1295
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:47,625
THE LAW WILL BE THUS, ASEEMING 

1296
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,093
-- ASSUMING YOU COULD GET EIGHT 

1297
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,761
OTHER JUDGES ON THE TEAM OF 

1298
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,463
NINE YOU TALKED ABOUT TO AGREE 

1299
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:52,730
WITH YOU. 

1300
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,199
COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE 

1301
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,567
IMPORTANCE OF DECIDING CASES ON 

1302
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:57,301
A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. 

1303
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:00,337
>> WE'LL ADD ANOTHER 20 

1304
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:01,305
SECONDS. 

1305
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,473
>> THANK YOU. 

1306
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,241
>> ABSOLUTELY, SENATOR. 

1307
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,843
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND, 

1308
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,279
AND I THINK SENATOR GRAHAM 

1309
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,713
ALLUDED TO THIS AS WELL, AS 

1310
00:39:09,713 --> 00:39:11,382
JUDGES YOU DON'T JUST ISSUE 

1311
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,050
POLICIES OR ISSUE OPINIONS OUT 

1312
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,818
OF THE BLUE. 

1313
00:39:14,818 --> 00:39:16,887
YOU DECIDE AS THE ARTICLE 3 

1314
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:19,824
SAYS CASES AND CONTROVERSIES, 

1315
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,493
AND THAT MEANS THERE'S A 

1316
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:23,661
PROCESS,. 

1317
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:24,795
LITIGANTS COME INTO THE FEDERAL 

1318
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:25,895
TRIAL COURT AND, FOR EXAMPLE, 

1319
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:27,732
AND LITIGATE AGAINST ONE 

1320
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:30,301
ANOTHER AND THERE'S A PROCESS 

1321
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,668
THERE, A TRIAL OR A SUMMARY 

1322
00:39:31,668 --> 00:39:33,170
JUDGMENT MOTION THE DISTRICT 

1323
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:33,703
JUDGE RENDERS A DECISION. 

1324
00:39:33,703 --> 00:39:37,408
THEN THAT COMES UP TO THE COURT 

1325
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,276
OF APPEALS IN MY CASE AND 

1326
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:40,511
THERE'S BRIEFING AND ORAL 

1327
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:40,745
GUMENT. 

1328
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:41,912
I LIKE TO SAY THERE'S A 

1329
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:42,179
PROCESS. 

1330
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,981
I LIKE TO SAY THE PROCESS 

1331
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:44,314
PROTECTS YOU. 

1332
00:39:44,314 --> 00:39:45,415
THAT'S ONE OF MY THINGS I 

1333
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:46,984
ALWAYS LIKE TO KEEP IN MIND. 

1334
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,620
YOU GO THROUGH A PROCESS TO 

1335
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,523
HELP MAKE GOOD DECISIONS, 

1336
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,557
DELIBERATIVE PROCESS, AND WE 

1337
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,625
HAVE A PROCESS, THE JUDGE IS 

1338
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,360
VERY FOCUSED ON PROCESS AND 

1339
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,294
HAVING THAT ORAL ARGUMENT, 

1340
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,264
HAVING THE BRIEFING, AND THEN 

1341
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:00,964
TALKING TO YOUR COLLEAGUES. 

1342
00:40:00,964 --> 00:40:03,300
YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND, YOU KNOW, 

1343
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,802
SENATOR, YOU'VE BEEN A JUDGE OF 

1344
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,737
COURSE, YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND 

1345
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,105
SOMETIMES BASED ON THE COMMENTS 

1346
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:08,706
OF COLLEAGUES. 

1347
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:09,807
SO THAT PROCESS IS IMPORTANT. 

1348
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,142
AND THEN TO YOUR POINT ABOUT 

1349
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:14,678
YOU'RE DECIDING THAT CASE, YOU 

1350
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:15,813
WRITE AN OPINION, YOU'RE NOT 

1351
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,180
TRYING TO RESOLVE EVERY ISSUE 

1352
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:17,848
IMAGINABL IN THE OPINION. 

1353
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,317
YOU'RE TRYING TO RESOLVE THIS 

1354
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,285
CASE UNDER THE PRINCIPLES AND 

1355
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:22,953
PRECEDENCE, THE TEXT OF THE LAW 

1356
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,054

STATUTE IN QUESTION AND DECIDE 

1358
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:26,857
THAT CASE OR CONTROVERSY. 

1359
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:29,226
AND THAT'S HOW JUDGES BUILD UP 

1360
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:30,194
A SYSTEM OF PRECEDENT OVER TIME 

1361
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:35,466
BY DECIDING ONE CASE AT A TIME 

1362
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:37,234
AND NOT TRYING TO DO MORE THAN 

1363
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:44,174
THEY CAN OR MORE THAN THEY 

1364
00:40:44,174 --> 00:40:44,407
SHOULD. 

1365
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:45,208
[ CROWD NOISE  ] 

1366
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:46,811
>> JUDGE, DON'T YOU THINK WHAT 

1367
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:50,514
YOU'VE DESCRIBED FOR US IN 

1368
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:51,415
DECIDING CASES ON A CASE-BY-

1369
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:53,284
CASE BASIS HAS AN IMPORTANT 

1370
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,086
FOUNDATION IN FAIRNESS TO THE 

1371
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,555

TO -- LITIGANT, THE PARTIES 

1373
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,724
THAT COME TO YOUR COURT BECAUSE 

1374
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,059
HOW WOULD SOMEBODY FEEL IF THEY 

1375
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,061
KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY ANNOUNCED 

1376
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:05,563
IN ALL CASES THAT HAVE TO DO 

1377
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:08,232
WITH SUBJECT "X" I'VE MADE UP 

1378
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:11,368
MY MIND, I DON'T CARE WHAT THE 

1379
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:14,605
FACTS ARE, ISN'T THAT UNFAIR TO 

1380
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:14,972
THE LITIGANTS? 

1381
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,942
>> IT CAN BE, SENATOR, AT LEAST 

1382
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,844
WHERE AN OVERBROAD RULING MAY 

1383
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,745
RESOLVE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WHO 

1384
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,814
ARE AFFECTED BY IT MAY HAVE 

1385
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,215
THOUGHT, WELL, I WASN'T PART OF 

1386
00:41:25,215 --> 00:41:26,116
THAT CASE. 

1387
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,418
WHY AM I NOW AFFECTED IN A 

1388
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:27,785
PARTICULAR WAY? 

1389
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,521
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I CAN 

1390
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,656
SAY ABOUT HOW I'VE TRIED TO 

1391
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:37,228

CONSEQUENCES. 

1397
00:41:45,435 --> 00:41:46,403
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS I GO 

1398
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:49,039
THROUGH SO MANY DRAFTS OF MY 

1399
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,241
OPINIONS AND REALLY WORK 

1400
00:41:51,241 --> 00:41:52,877

1408
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,724
SO IMPORTANT TO BE CLEAR IN THE 

1409
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,860
OPINIONS AND TO BE EXACTLY 

1410
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,797
PRECISE AND NOT TO DECIDE TOO 

1411
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,299

SEPTEMBER THE 11th, 2001. 

1417
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,985
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU HEARD 

1418
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,620
THAT THE PLANES HIT THE WORLD 

1419
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,721
TRADE CENTER AND WASHINGTON 

1420
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,691
D.C. AND ANOTHER PLANE HIT THE 

1421
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:41,291
PENTAGON HERE IN WASHINGTON? 

1422
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:41,991
>> I REMEMBER -- 

1423
00:42:41,991 --> 00:42:43,527
>> YOU WERE HERE IN WASHINGTON. 

1424
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:45,496
>> I WAS IN THE WEST WING WHEN 

1425
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,931
IT HIT THE SECOND TOWER. 

1426
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:50,601
I REMEMBER THAT UP IN THE 

1427
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:51,702
UPSTAIRS COUNSEL'S OFFICE WITH 

1428
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:55,105
A COUPLE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE 

1429
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:55,939
COUNSEL'S OFFICE. 

1430
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:57,474
AND THEN WE WERE USHERED 

1431
00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:00,244
DOWNSTAIRS, AND THEN TOLD TO 

1432
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,013
GET OUT, RUN OUT BECAUSE THERE 

1433
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:04,281
WAS FEAR, AS WE LATER LEARNED 

1434
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,215
ABOUT FLIGHT 93. 

1435
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:06,116
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS 

1436
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,385
HEADED TO THE CAPITOL OR THE 

1437
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:12,022
WHITE HOUSE OR SOME OTHER 

1438

1439
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:16,961
AND THE HEROS OF FLIGHT 93 

1440
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,262
SAVED SO MANY AMERICANS, 

1441
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,764
SACRIFICED -- A SACRIFICE THAT, 

1442
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,099
OF COURSE, WE ALL STILL 

1443
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,034
CELEBRATE IN THE SENSE OF 

1444
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:24,868
CELEBRATING THEIR LIVES AND 

1445
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:29,640
THEIR HEROISM FOR SAVING ALL OF 

1446
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,108
US HERE IN WASHINGTON, BUT 

1447
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:34,411
ENDED UP OUT IN LAFAYETTE PARK 

1448
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:38,182
WITH THE REST OF THE STAFF AND 

1449
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:41,719

00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,157
ALL THE ISSUES THAT CAME BEFORE 

1454
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:47,323
US. 

1455
00:43:47,323 --> 00:43:50,360
THERE WAS A NEW KIND OF WAR AS 

1456
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,829
PRESIDENT BUSH DESCRIBED WITH 

1457
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:54,131
AN ENEMY THAT DIDN'T WEAR 

1458
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:54,865
UNIFORMS AND THAT WOULD ATTACK 

1459
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,400
CIVILIANS, AND SO NEW KINDS OF 

1460
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,769
LAWS HAD TO BE CONSIDERED AND 

1461
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:02,005
CONGRESS HAD TO WORK THROUGH 

1462
00:44:02,005 --> 00:44:05,843
THAT AND PRESIDENT BUSH HAD TO 

1463
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:08,245
FOCUS SO INTENTLY, AND AS I'VE 

1464
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,614
SAID BEFORE, MY REMEMBRANCE IS 

1465
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:13,550
THAT ON SEPTEMBER 12th, HIS 

1466
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,519
BASIC MENTALITY WAS THIS WILL 

1467
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:18,822
NOT HAPPEN AGAIN, AND HAVING 

1468
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,858
TRAVELED WITH HIM FROM 2003 TO 

1469
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:22,359
2006 EVERYWHERE AS STAFF 

1470
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:23,227
SECRETARY AND SEEING HIM UP 

1471
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,329
CLOSE, I STILL THINK EVERYDAY I 

1472
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,197
WAS WITH HIM DURING THOSE 

1473
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,066
YEARS, EVERY MORNING WHEN HE 

1474
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,601
GOT UP, IT WAS STILL SEPTEMBER 

1475
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:31,601
12th, 2001, THIS WILL NOT 

1476
00:44:31,601 --> 00:44:31,935
HAPPEN AGAIN. 

1477
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:32,970
AND TO SEE THAT FOCUS -- OF 

1478
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,205
COURSE HE HAD TO DO ALL THE 

1479
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:38,008
OTHER THINGS OF THE PRESIDENCY 

1480
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:41,712
AND ALL THE OTHER LEGISLATIVE 

1481
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:42,579
AND REGULATORY AND CEREMONIAL 

1482
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:44,782
ASPECTS, BUT HE WAS SO FOCUSED 

1483
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,683
ON THAT, AND I'M SURE THAT'S 

1484
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:50,887
BEEN TRUE OF THE SUCCEEDING 

1485
00:44:50,887 --> 00:44:54,124
PRESIDENTS AS WELL BECAUSE THE 

1486
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:58,495
THREAT -- THE THREAT STILL 

1487
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:58,895
EXISTS OF COURSE. 

1488
00:44:58,895 --> 00:45:02,800
>> WELL, AS WE CAME TO LEARN, 

1489
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,768
OSAMA BIN LADEN AND AL-QAIDA 

1490
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:09,206
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT ATTACK 

1491
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,908
AND HAS NOW MORPHED INTO OTHER 

1492
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:16,079
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE ISIS AND THE 

1493
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:16,279
LIKE. 

1494
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:18,215
BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU, YOU HAD 

1495
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,350
TO THEN SIT IN JUDGMENT LATER 

1496
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:23,053
ON IN A CASE, THE HAMDONG CASE 

1497
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,321
WHICH YOU ALLUDED TO EARLIER 

1498
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:28,758
WHERE THE DEFENDANT WAS OSAMA 

1499
00:45:28,758 --> 00:45:30,360
BIN LADEN'S PERSONAL BODYGUARD 

1500
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,196
AND DRIVER. 

1501
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:35,198
HE WAS CAPTURED BY U.S. FORCES 

1502
00:45:35,198 --> 00:45:37,868
IN AFGHANISTAN AFTER 9/11 AND 

1503
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:39,436
DETAINED IN GUANTANAMO BAY. 

1504
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:40,671
HE SUBSEQUENTLY WENT THROUGH A 

1505
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:45,475
MILITARY TRIBUNAL, AND THEN 

1506
00:45:45,475 --> 00:45:47,211
THAT CASE WAS APPEALED TO YOUR 

1507
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:48,846
COURT. 

1508
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,180
AND JUST CORRECT ME IF I'M 

1509
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,317
WRONG, BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE 

1510
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,452
EXPERIENCE YOU AND EVERYBODY 

1511
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:56,987
YOU CARED ABOUT HAVING BEEN 

1512
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,989
THROUGH THIS TERRIBLE TRAFFESTY 

1513
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:02,359
OF 9/11, YOU RULED IN FAVOR OF 

1514
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:03,760
OSAMA BIN LADEN'S BODYGUARD AND 

1515
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,160
DRIVER, CORRECT? 

1516
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:04,895
>> THAT IS CORRECT. 

1517
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,229
I WROTE THE MAJORITY OPINION. 

1518
00:46:06,229 --> 00:46:08,165
>> HOW COULD YOU DO THAT? 

1519
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,334
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO THAT? 

1520
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:13,070
>> THE RULE OF LAW APPLIES TO 

1521
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,339
ALL WHO COME BEFORE THE COURTS 

1522
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:17,574
IN THE UNITED STATES. 

1523
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:19,977
>> EVEN AN ENEMY COMBATANT? 

1524
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,778
>> EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. 

1525
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:25,249
EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO -- 

1526
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,484
>> EVEN A NON-CITIZEN? 

1527
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:27,718
>> YES. 

1528
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:31,989
NON-CITIZENS WHO ARE TRIED IN 

1529
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:35,359
U.S. COURTS OF COURSE HAVE THE 

1530
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:35,859
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. 

1531
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:36,693
AND REALLY MY MODEL ON THAT, 

1532
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,996
JUDICIAL MODEL FOR THINKING 

1533
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:41,298
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT 

1534
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:45,002
BECAUSE I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT 

1535
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:48,172
YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT, JUSTICE 

1536
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:51,208
JACKSON, OF COURSE, ROBERT 

1537
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,676
JACKSON HAD BEEN FRANKLIN 

1538
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:53,477
ROOSEVELT'S ATTORNEY GENERAL IN 

1539
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,346
THE CORMATZU CASE EVEN THOUGH 

1540
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:59,249
THAT WAS ONE OF PRESIDENT 

1541
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:00,617
ROOSEVELT'S POLICIES, JACKSON 

1542
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:01,218
THE MAJORITY OPINION NOW 

1543
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:04,187
OVERRULED BUT JUSTICE JACKSON 

1544
00:47:04,187 --> 00:47:07,224
DISSENTED AND RULED AGAINST THE 

1545
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:07,624
ROOSEVELT POLICY. 

1546
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,226
JUSTICES CLARK AND BURTON, TWO 

1547
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,694
APPOINTEES OF PRESIDENT TRUMAN 

1548
00:47:11,694 --> 00:47:13,997
ARE THE TWO DECIDING VOTES IN 

1549
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,232
YOUNGSTOWN STEEL. 

1550
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:16,600
THAT'S A 6-3 DECISION. 

1551
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:21,204
THOSE TWO ARE THE DECIDING 

1552
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:21,571
VOTES THEREFOR. 

1553
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:23,240
THEY BOTH WERE APPOINTEES OF 

1554
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,441
PRESIDENT TRUMAN, IT'S WARTIME 

1555
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:24,942
AGAINST KOREA. 

1556
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,977
THEY GET TO THE SUPREME COURT, 

1557
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,213
THEY'RE THE DECIDING VOTES IN 

1558
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,114
THE YOUNGSTOWN STEEL CASE WHICH 

1559
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:31,747
WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY NATIONAL 

1560
00:47:31,747 --> 00:47:33,383
MOMENT, ONE OF THE GREAT 

1561
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:35,285
MOMENTS, AND SO YOUR CONCEPTION 

1562
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:38,121
OF THE ROLE OF A JUDGE IS IT'S 

1563
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:39,923
ABOUT THE LAW, THAT'S DISTINCT 

1564
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,758
FROM POLICY AND OUR JUDICIARY 

1565
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:44,494
DEPENDS ON HAVING PEOPLE IN IT 

1566
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:45,762
AND WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE A 

1567
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:46,362
WONDERFUL FEDERAL JUDICIARY, 

1568
00:47:46,362 --> 00:47:48,866
PEOPLE IN IT WHO UNDERSTAND THE 

1569
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,400
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAW AND 

1570
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,303
POLICY AND ARE WILLING TO APPLY 

1571
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:54,338
PRINCIPLES OF EQUAL JUSTICE 

1572
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:57,841
UNDER LAW TO ANYONE WHO COMES 

1573
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,443
BEFORE THE COURT, EVEN THE MOST 

1574
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:00,344
UNPOPULAR POSSIBLE DEFENDANT IS 

1575
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,012
STILL ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS 

1576
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:02,779
AND THE RULE OF LAW. 

1577
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:05,716
AND I'VE TRIED TO ENSURE THAT 

1578
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:06,116
AS A JUDGE. 

1579
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:09,385
>> WELL, IT'S HARD FOR ME TO 

1580
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:14,324
IMAGINE A MORE UNPOPULAR 

1581
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,693
DEFENDANT THAN OSAMA BIN 

1582
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,427
LADEN'S DRIVER AND PERSONAL 

1583
00:48:18,427 --> 00:48:18,728
BODYGUARD. 

1584
00:48:18,728 --> 00:48:20,964
SO I FIND THE SUGGESTION THAT 

1585
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,733
SOMEHOW YOU ARE PREJUDICED 

1586
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,601
AGAINST THE SMALL GUY IN FAVOR 

1587
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:27,571
OF THE BIG GUY OR THAT YOU ARE 

1588
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,206
PICKING AND CHOOSING WHO YOU'RE 

1589
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,509
GOING TO RERND JUDGMENT IN 

1590
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:33,343
FAVOR OF BASED -- RENDER 

1591
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:35,879
JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF BASED ON 

1592
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:37,381
THE RULE OF LAW, I THINK THAT 

1593
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:38,415
ANSWERS THAT QUESTION 

1594
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,750
CONCLUSIVELY FOR ME, THE FACT 

1595
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,550
THAT YOU COULD SEPARATE 

1596
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,151
YOURSELF FROM THE EMOTIONAL 

1597
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,853
INVOLVEMENT YOU HAD ALONG WITH 

1598
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,688
SO MANY PEOPLE YOU WORKED 

1599
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:45,856
CLOSELY WITH IN THE WHITE HOUSE 

1600
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,791
ON SEPTEMBER THE 11th, AND YOU 

1601
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,259
COULD THEN AS A JUDGE, AFTER 

1602
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,827
YOU PUT ON THE BLACK ROBE AND 

1603
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:56,667
TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE, YOU 

1604
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:59,703
COULD THEN RENDER A JUDGMENT IN 

1605
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:02,639
FAVOR OF OSAMA BIN LADEN'S 

1606
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:03,340
BODYGUARD AND DRIVER BECAUSE 

1607
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:11,548
YOU APPLIED THE LAW EQUALLY TO 

1608
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,483
EVERYBODY THAT COMES TO YOUR 

1609
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:19,756
COURT. 

1610
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:23,427
SOMETIMES THE -- LET ME ALLUDE 

1611
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:24,828
TO SOMETHING SENATOR SASSE I 

1612
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:26,530
THINK WAS ELOQUENTLY SPEAKING 

1613
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,698
ABOUT YESTERDAY IN TERMS OF THE 

1614
00:49:28,698 --> 00:49:29,298
SEPARATION OF POWERS, VERY 

1615
00:49:29,298 --> 00:49:31,334
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF OUR 

1616
00:49:31,334 --> 00:49:32,035
CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM AND ONE 

1617
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:35,372
THAT I KNOW YOU'VE DEALT WITH 

1618
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:36,907
OFTEN ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT COURT 

1619
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:41,044
OF APPEALS, AND THAT HAS TO DO 

1620
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:44,047
WITH WHAT I'VE READ SOME JUDGES 

1621
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:47,017
TALK ABOUT, SOME CONSTITUTIONAL 

1622
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:47,918
SCHOLARS TALK ABOUT A 

1623
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:49,252
CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE 

1624
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:50,520
BRANCHES, IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN 

1625
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,491
THE D.C. CIRCUIT COURT OR THE 

1626
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,460
SUPREME COURT DECIDES A CASE, 

1627
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,562
THEY FINALLY DECIDE THAT CASE, 

1628
00:49:58,562 --> 00:49:59,596
BUT THEY DON'T FINALLY DECIDE 

1629
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:00,497
WHAT THE POLICY IS -- 

1630
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,064
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

1631
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:03,733
>> FOR THE UNITED STATES OR THE 

1632
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:04,300
AMERICAN PEOPLE, CORRECT? 

1633
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:04,934
>> THAT'S CORRECT, SENATOR. 

1634
00:50:04,934 --> 00:50:08,105
AND I THINK ONE OF THE 

1635
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:08,705
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT JUDGES 

1636
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:11,975
CAN DO IS ADHERE OF COURSE TO 

1637
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,909
THE LAWS PASSED BY CONGRESS, 

1638
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:16,279
BUT THEN IN WRITING THE OPINION 

1639
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,115
MAKE CLEAR, AND I'VE DONE THIS 

1640
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,017
BEFORE AND A LOT OF MY 

1641
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,084
COLLEAGUES DO THIS IS THAT 

1642
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:21,785
PERHAPS THE STATUTE NEEDS 

1643
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:24,821
UPDATING, BUT IF IT DOES, THAT 

1644
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,990
IS THE ROLE OF CONGRESS TO 

1645
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:27,757
UPDATE THE STATUTE, OR IF 

1646
00:50:27,757 --> 00:50:28,592
THERE'S -- SOMETIMES THERE'LL 

1647
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:31,728
BE A HOLE IN A STATUTE OR 

1648
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:33,230
SOMETHING THAT SEEMS UNINTENDED 

1649
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,765
IN A STATUTE AND TO ALERT 

1650
00:50:35,765 --> 00:50:36,633
CONGRESS TO THAT. 

1651
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:37,867
CHIEF JUDGE KATZMAN OF THE 2nd 

1652
00:50:37,867 --> 00:50:40,070
CIRCUIT WHO'S A GREAT JUDGE I 

1653
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,571
SERVED WITH ON THE JUDICIAL 

1654
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:42,305
BRANCH COMMITTEE WHO IS 

1655
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:43,873
APPOINTED BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE 

1656
00:50:43,873 --> 00:50:45,942
AND HE HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT 

1657
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:46,542
STATUTORY INTERPRETATION, BUT 

1658
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:49,312
HE'S ALSO BEEN THE LEADER OF A 

1659
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,715
PROJECT TO MAKE SURE THAT 

1660
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,183
CONGRESS IS ALERTED OF 

1661
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:54,651
POTENTIAL STATUTORY ISSUES THAT 

1662
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:56,420
LOOK LIKE THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN 

1663
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,621
THINGS THAT PERHAPS CONGRESS 

1664
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:59,289
WOULD NOT HAVE INTENDED OR AT 

1665
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:00,590
LEAST CONGRESS WOULD WANT 

1666
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:04,160
BROUGHT TO ITS ATTENTION SO IT 

1667
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,030
COULD FIX AND -- [ CROWD NOISE  

1668
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,464
] 

1669
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:10,100
>> AND SO THAT PROJECT HAS BEEN 

1670
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:10,500
VERY SUCCESSFUL. 

1671
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,434
I THINK CHIEF JUDGE KATZMAN'S 

1672
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:12,802
PROJECT, AND IT'S ONE EVEN 

1673
00:51:12,802 --> 00:51:16,706
WITHOUT THAT PROJECT HOW YOU 

1674
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:17,773
WRITE YOUR OPINIONS I THINK IS 

1675
00:51:17,773 --> 00:51:18,074
IMPORTANT. 

1676
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,509
WE DON'T UPDATE THE STATUTES, 

1677
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:20,042
YOU UPDATE THE STATUTES. 

1678
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:22,879
BUT IT'S GOOD FOR US TO WRITE 

1679
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:24,748
OUR OPINIONS IN A WAY THAT 

1680
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:25,882
POINTS OUT POTENTIAL ISSUES 

1681
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,184
THAT CONGRESS MIGHT WANT TO BE 

1682
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:27,450
AWARE OF. 

1683
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,853
>> AND THAT'S PART OF THE 

1684
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:30,720
CONVERSATION BETWEEN -- 

1685
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:30,953
>> YES. 

1686
00:51:30,953 --> 00:51:34,224
>> THE TWO CO-EQUAL BRANCHES OF 

1687
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,926
GOVERNMENT. 

1688
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,160
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

1689
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,596
AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT 

1690
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,396
DIALOGUE TO HAVE BETWEEN 

1691
00:51:40,396 --> 00:51:43,500
CONGRESS AND THE JUDICIARY AND 

1692
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,701
THE BACK AND FORTH IS VERY 

1693
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,203
IMPORTANT ON THAT FRONT, AND I 

1694
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,370
THINK THAT'S ONE THING I'M 

1695
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,438
ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT IN MY 

1696
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:48,705
OPINIONS. 

1697
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:51,140
YOU WRITE THE LAW, BUT IF THE 

1698
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,242
LAW LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOME 

1699
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:55,212
ISSUE WITH IT, SOME FLAW OR 

1700
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:57,114
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE AN 

1701
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,482
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE IN THE 

1702
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:01,284
OPINION, YOU CAN IDENTIFY IT, 

1703
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,820
AND THAT CAN BE SOMETHING THAT 

1704
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:04,854
CONGRESS CAN TURN ITS ATTENTION 

1705
00:52:04,854 --> 00:52:07,490
TO SOMETIMES BECAUSE I'M WELL 

1706
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,125
AWARE THAT STATUTORY DRAFTING 

1707
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,226
IS A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS. 

1708
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:11,761
THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK JUDGES 

1709
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:15,065
NEED TO BE ACTUALLY MORE AWARE 

1710
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,433
OF IS HOW DIFFICULT THE 

1711
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:17,033
LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING PROCESS 

1712
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:18,268
IS, EVEN IF YOU'RE DOING IT AS 

1713
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,837
ONE PERSON IT WOULD BE 

1714
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:22,172
DIFFICULT, BUT THEN YOU'RE 

1715
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:23,273
DOING IT AS A COLLECTIVE BODY 

1716
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,574
AND THEN YOU'RE DOING IT WITH 

1717
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:25,542
THE HOUSE AND WITH THE 

1718
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:25,975
PRESIDENT INVOLVED. 

1719
00:52:25,975 --> 00:52:27,277
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN IT 

1720
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:30,413
AND IT'S HARD TO HAVE -- WITH 

1721
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,249
ALL THE COMPROMISES INHERENT IN 

1722
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:33,717
THAT, HARD TO HAVE A CRYSTAL 

1723
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:34,484
CLARITY ON EVERY POSSIBLE 

1724
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:34,717
TOPIC. 

1725
00:52:34,717 --> 00:52:35,652
SO AS JUDGES, I THINK, NUMBER 

1726
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,988
ONE, WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE 

1727
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,490
PROCESS THAT YOU GO THROUGH AS 

1728
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,123
LEGISLATORS, THAT MEANS ADHERE 

1729
00:52:41,123 --> 00:52:43,026
TO THE COMPROMISES THAT ARE 

1730
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:44,794
MADE, THE TEXT AS WRITTEN, BUT 

1731
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:46,196
ALSO WHEN WE WRITE OUR OPINIONS 

1732
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:49,199
IF THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING 

1733
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,066
THAT'S NOT WORKING OUT, IT'S 

1734
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:51,668
NOT -- IT'S APPROPRIATE I THINK 

1735
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:55,005
FOR JUDGES TO POINT THAT OUT IN 

1736
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:55,572
THEIR OPINIONS. 

1737
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,707
>> AND OF COURSE EVEN IF IT'S 

1738
00:52:57,707 --> 00:53:01,011
CONSTITUTIONAL BASIS FOR YOUR 

1739
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,313
DECISION, THAT COULD BE CHANGED 

1740
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:06,383
BY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, 

1741
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:06,650
CORRECT? 

1742
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:07,484
>> WELL, THAT'S CORRECT AS 

1743
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:07,751
WELL. 

1744
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:12,889
THE FRAMERS DID NOT THINK THE 

1745
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:15,492
CONSTITUTION WAS PERFECT BY ANY 

1746
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:15,759
STRETCH. 

1747
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:16,559
THEY KNEW IT HAD IMPERFECTIONS 

1748
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,794
FOR STARTERS, THE ORIGINAL 

1749
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:19,429
CONSTITUTION DID NOT HAVE THE 

1750
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:21,198
BILL OF RIGHTS, THE FIRST 10 

1751
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,266
AMENDMENT, SO THERE WAS A LOT 

1752
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:25,335
OF DISCUSSION AT THE RATIFYING 

1753
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:26,303
CONVENTIONS ABOUT HAVING A BILL 

1754
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,338
OF RIGHTS, AND THAT WAS QUICKLY 

1755
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:31,107
DONE IN THE FIRST CONGRESS IN 

1756
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:34,010
NEW YORK IN 1789 OF COURSE BY 

1757
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,412
JAMES MADISON TAKING THE LEAD 

1758
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:35,679
ON THAT. 

1759
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,313
BUT SO TOO THEY DID NOT THINK 

1760
00:53:37,313 --> 00:53:38,414
IT WAS PERFECT. 

1761
00:53:38,414 --> 00:53:41,318
THEY HAD AN AMENDMENT PROCESS 

1762
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,687
THAT SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE 5 OF 

1763
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:44,788
THE CONSTITUTION, AND THAT 

1764
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:46,722
AMENDMENT PROCESS WAS INTENDED 

1765
00:53:46,722 --> 00:53:47,223
TO BE USED. 

1766
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:49,960
AND WE'VE SEEN IT USED TO 

1767
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,261
CORRECT STRUCTURAL ISSUES, THE 

1768
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,862
12th EAMENTZ ON PRESIDENTIAL 

1769
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:53,462
ELECTION, THE 17th AMENDMENT, 

1770
00:53:53,462 --> 00:53:57,234
OF COURSE, AS YOU ALL KNOW WELL 

1771
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,237
ON SENATE ELECTIONS, THE 22nd 

1772
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:00,737
AMENDMENT WHICH LIMITED 

1773
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,206
PRESIDENTS TO ONLY TWO TERMS, 

1774
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:05,942
THE 25th AMENDMENT WHICH 

1775
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:07,177
CORRECTED SOME ISSUES WITH 

1776
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:08,712
RESPECT TO VICE PRESIDENCY, AND 

1777
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:13,350
SO TOO OF COURSE THE 13th, 14th 

1778
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,750
AND 15th AMENDMENTS, THE MOST 

1779
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:15,986
IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS IN THE 

1780
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:20,624
CONSTITUTION IN MANY RESPECTS 

1781
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:22,191
BECAUSE IT BROUGHT THE PROMISE 

1782
00:54:22,191 --> 00:54:23,660
OF RACIAL EQUALITY THAT HAD 

1783
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,563
BEEN DENIED AT THE TIME OF THE 

1784
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:28,798
ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION INTO THE 

1785
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:29,833
TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION. 

1786
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:32,535
SO THE JOB OF THE PEOPLE WHICH 

1787
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:34,237
IS THE CONGRESS AND THE STATE 

1788
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:39,342
LEGISLATURES IS TO AMEND THE 

1789
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:39,675
CONSTITUTION. 

1790
00:54:39,675 --> 00:54:41,811
IT'S NOT THE JOB OF JUDGES TO 

1791
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:44,481
DO THAT ON OUR OWN AND 

1792
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:45,248
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A BASIC DIVIDE 

1793
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:45,681
OF CONSTITUTIONAL 

1794
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:46,783
RESPONSIBILITY THAT IS SET 

1795
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,953
FORTH RIGHT IN THE TEXT OF 

1796
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,921
ARTICLE 5 OF THE CONSTITUTION. 

1797
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:54,124
>> I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO SAID 

1798
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:54,591
IT. 

1799
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:57,060
I THINK JUSTICE JACKSON PERHAPS 

1800
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,396
WHO SAID THE SUPREME COURT IS 

1801
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:00,930
ALWAYS RIGHT, IT'S NOT FINAL 

1802
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:01,664
BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS RIGHT, IT'S 

1803
00:55:01,664 --> 00:55:03,600
RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S FINAL OR 

1804
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,601
WORDS TO THAT EFFECT. 

1805
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:08,104
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE MORE I 

1806
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:09,606
GOT INTO THAT, THE MORE I 

1807
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:11,341
DISAGREED WITH THAT BECAUSE IT 

1808
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,542
IS A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE 

1809
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:14,711
BRANCHES, AND IF THE AMERICAN 

1810
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,913
PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IT IS A 

1811
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:18,815
CONSTITUTIONAL MATTER, THE WAY 

1812
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:19,516
THE CONSTITUTION IS BEING 

1813
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,151
INTERPRETED, IT'S WITHIN OUR 

1814
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,953
POWER AS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO 

1815
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:25,021
CHANGE OUR OWN CONSTITUTION BY 

1816
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:25,321
AMENDMENT. 

1817
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:27,157
THERE'S PROVISIONS IN THE 

1818
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,325
CONSTITUTION ITSELF TO DO THAT. 

1819
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:33,062
IT'S HARD AND IT SHOULD BE 

1820
00:55:33,062 --> 00:55:34,497
HARD, BUT ULTIMATELY THE 

1821
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,466
AUTHORITY THAT WE DELEGATE TO 

1822
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:38,034
THE GOVERNMENT FINDS ITS ORIGIN 

1823
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,536
IN THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED. 

1824
00:55:40,536 --> 00:55:42,572
IT'S NOT SOMETHING DICTATED TO 

1825
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:45,275
US FROM DOWN ON HIGH FROM THE 

1826
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:48,311
MARBLE PALACE OR SOMEWHERE LIKE 

1827
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:48,844
THAT HERE IN WASHINGTON. 

1828
00:55:48,844 --> 00:55:51,080
IT IS ULTIMATELY OUR 

1829
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,782
GOVERNMENT, OUR RESPONSIBILITY, 

1830
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,484
OUR AUTHORITY THAT PROVIDES 

1831
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:56,185
LEGITIMACY TO THE GOVERNMENT 

1832
00:55:56,185 --> 00:55:56,418
ITSELF. 

1833
00:55:56,418 --> 00:55:57,554
YOU AGREE WITH THAT? 

1834
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:58,588
>> I AGREE. 

1835
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,089
OF COURSE WITH THAT, SENATOR, 

1836
00:56:00,089 --> 00:56:04,694
THE PEOPLE -- WE THE PEOPLE 

1837
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,963
FORM THE CONSTITUTION OF THE 

1838
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,898
UNITED STATES AND THE 

1839
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:10,500
SOVEREIGNTY THAT THE PEOPLE ARE 

1840
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,868
THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY. 

1841
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,369
AND YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT JUSTICE 

1842
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:13,736
JACKSON'S LINE. 

1843
00:56:13,736 --> 00:56:15,305
IK IT IS A CLEVER LINE, -- I 

1844
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:16,940
THINK IT IS A CLEVER LINE, BUT 

1845
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:17,574
ULTIMATELY I AGREE WITH YOU. 

1846
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,943
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A LITTLE BIT OF 

1847
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:22,579
A PROBLEM WITH THAT LINE 

1848
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:23,680
BECAUSE WE'RE INFALLIBLE 

1849
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,747
BECAUSE WE'RE FINAL. 

1850
00:56:24,747 --> 00:56:25,781
NO, BOTH PARTS OF THAT ARE 

1851
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:28,451
WRONG IN SOME SENSE BECAUSE I 

1852
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:30,487
NEVER WANT TO THINK OF THE 

1853
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:31,788
COURT AS INFALLIBLE, AND I ALSO 

1854
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:33,323
NEVER WANT TO THINK OF IT 

1855
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,325
NECESSARILY, YOU KNOW, IN THE 

1856
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:37,227
WAY YOU'RE DESCRIBING EITHER 

1857
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,261
BECAUSE THERE IS THE PEOPLE 

1858
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,763
ALWAYS HAVE AN ABILITY TO 

1859
00:56:40,763 --> 00:56:41,564
CORRECT THROUGH THE AMENDMENT 

1860
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:41,831
PROCESS. 

1861
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,199
NOW, THE AMENDMENT PROCESS IS 

1862
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:44,299
HARD AND HASN'T BEEN USED AS 

1863
00:56:44,299 --> 00:56:45,201
MUCH IN RECENT DECADES. 

1864
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:49,906
BUT OF COURSE AT THE BEGINNING 

1865
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,809
OF THE COUNTRY, THE AMENDMENTS 

1866
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:53,977
WERE CRITICAL AND DREAD SCOTT, 

1867
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,512
OF COURSE, THE AWFUL EXAMPLE OF 

1868
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:56,613
JUST A HORRIFIC SUPREME COURT 

1869
00:56:56,613 --> 00:57:00,984
DECISION THAT IS THEN CORRECTED 

1870
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:04,420
IN PART, AT LEAST ON PAPER IN 

1871
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,056
THE 14th AMENDMENT, 13th, 14th 

1872
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:08,124
AMENDMENTS, AND THAT'S AN 

1873
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,226
IMPORTANT EXAMPLE I THINK OF 

1874
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:11,260
YOUR -- PROBABLY THE BEST 

1875
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,329
EXAMPLE, FRANKLY, OF THE POINT 

1876
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:16,966
YOU'RE MAKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE 

1877
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:19,135
BEING ABLE TO RESPOND TO 

1878
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:20,703
HORRIFIC DECISION OF THE 

1879
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:21,070
SUPREME COURT. 

1880
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,405
>> WELL, IN FAIRNESS TO JUSTICE 

1881
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:25,141
JACKSON, MAYBE HE WAS THINKING 

1882
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:27,710
AS I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT ABOUT 

1883
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:30,113
THE EXPRESSION AS BEING BINDING 

1884
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,147
ON LOWER COURT JUDGES, TRIAL 

1885
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:32,682
JUDGES, APPELLATE COURT JUDGES 

1886
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:35,418
AND THE SUPREME COURT DOES HAVE 

1887
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:36,453
THE FINAL WORD IN THAT FOOD 

1888
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,088
CHAIN OF THE JUDICIARY BUT NOT 

1889
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:40,723
IN TERMS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL 

1890
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:41,357
AUTHORITY OF THE AMERICAN 

1891
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:42,926
PEOPLE TO DECIDE WHAT LAWS 

1892
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:43,693
SHOULD GOVERN THEM. 

1893
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:46,061
>> I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY 

1894
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:46,428
RIGHT, SENATOR. 

1895
00:57:46,428 --> 00:57:48,665
I DON'T WANT TO BE JUSTICE -- 

1896
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:56,506
JUSTICE JACKSON IS ONE OF OUR 

1897
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:56,939
GREATEST JUSTICES. 

1898
00:57:56,939 --> 00:57:57,640
TO QUESTION ANYTHING, WHETHER 

1899
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,109
IT'S COROMATZU, OR YOUNGSTOWN 

1900
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:01,244
JUSTICE JACKSON WROTE SOME OF 

1901
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:01,978
THE GREATEST OPINIONS AND THE 

1902
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,513
EXAMPLE OF JUDICIAL 

1903
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:06,182
INDEPENDENCE AS WELL, BUT ON 

1904
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:07,550
THAT ONE LINE, I TAKE YOUR 

1905
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:07,783
POINT. 

1906
00:58:07,783 --> 00:58:10,486
>> LET ME JUST ASK YOU ONE LAST 

1907
00:58:10,486 --> 00:58:11,254
QUESTION. 

1908
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:15,058
WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE 

1909
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:19,429
ROLE OF PRECEDENT AND SENATOR 

1910
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:21,064
FEINSTEIN TALKED ABOUT STARRY 

1911
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:21,965
DECIDESUS AND BASICALLY CASES 

1912
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:26,069
THAT HAVE BEEN DECIDED PROVIDE 

1913
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,403
THE PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE CASES. 

1914
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:31,107
BUT ON OCCASION THE SUPREME 

1915
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:33,810
COURT HAS DECIDED THAT ITS 

1916
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:38,381
DECISIONS WERE JUST WRONG AND 

1917
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,349
CHOSEN TO OVERRULE THOSE 

1918
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:39,816
PREVIOUS DECISIONS. 

1919
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:41,217
I'M THINKING OF PLESSY VERSUS 

1920
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:42,318
FERGUSON, FOR EXAMPLE, WHICH 

1921
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:46,956
WAS A SCAR ON OUR BODY POL 

1922
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:47,824
PARTICULAR THAT SAID SEPARATE 

1923
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,025
BUT EQUAL EDUCATIONAL 

1924
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,960
FACILITIES MET THE 

1925
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,261
CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT OF 

1926
00:58:52,261 --> 00:58:53,729
THE 14th AMENDMENT. 

1927
00:58:53,729 --> 00:58:56,699
BUT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE 

1928
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,433
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES 

1929
00:58:57,433 --> 00:59:04,107
UNDER WHICH THE SUPREME COURT 

1930
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:04,674
WOULD REVISIT A PRECEDENT? 

1931
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:08,645
>> WELL, BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF 

1932
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:09,545
EDUCATION OF COURSE OVERTURNED 

1933
00:59:09,545 --> 00:59:12,515
PLESSI, AND PLESSI WAS WRONG 

1934
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:13,483
THE DAY IT WAS DECIDED. 

1935
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:17,453
IT WAS INCONSISTENT WITH TEXT 

1936
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:18,521
AND MEANING OF THE 14th 

1937
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:19,789
AMENDMENT WHICH GUARANTEED 

1938
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:20,322
EQUAL PROTECTION, AND THE 

1939
00:59:20,322 --> 00:59:22,292
SUPREME COURT IN THE SHROUDER 

1940
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:24,327
VERSUS WEST VIRGINIA CASE IN 

1941
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,629
1880, JURY SELECTION CASE HAD 

1942
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:27,597
SAID WHAT IS THIS AMENDMENT BUT 

1943
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:30,066
THAT THE LAW SHALL BE THE SAME 

1944
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:35,305
FOR THE BLACK AND THE WHITE, 

1945
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:35,938
AND THE SUPREME COURT 

1946
00:59:35,938 --> 00:59:38,374
UNFORTUNATELY BACKTRACKED FROM 

1947
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:41,377
THAT CLEAR PRINCIPLE IN THE PZ 

1948
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:43,046
LESSI DECISION -- IN THE PLESSI 

1949
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:43,946
DECISION AND A HORRIFIC 

1950
00:59:43,946 --> 00:59:44,914
DECISION WHICH ALLOWED SEPARATE 

1951
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:49,052
BUT EQUAL, AND THEN BROWN 

1952
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:50,319
VERSUS BOARD CORRECTED THAT IN 

1953
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,589
1954, OF COURSE CORRECTED IT ON 

1954
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,757
PAPER, STILL DECADES, AND WE'RE 

1955
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,192
STILL SEEKING TO ACHIEVE RACIAL 

1956
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:57,927
EQUALITY, THE LONG MARCH FOR 

1957
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,262
RACIAL EQUALITY IS NOT OVER. 

1958
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,665
BUT BROWN VERSUS BOARD, AS I'VE 

1959
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:05,334
SAID PUBLICLY MANY TIMES 

1960
01:00:05,334 --> 01:00:06,502
BEFORE, THE SINGLE GREATEST 

1961
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:08,771
MOMENT IN SUPREME COURT HISTORY 

1962
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,707
BY -- IN SO MANY WAYS. 

1963
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:11,807
THE UNIMEN AND WOMENNITY, THE 

1964
01:00:11,807 --> 01:00:13,142
CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN ACHIEVED 

1965
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:16,179
WHICH IS JUST A GREAT MOMENT, 

1966
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:17,213
THE FACT THAT IT LIVED UP TO 

1967
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:19,382
THE TEXT OF THE EQUAL 

1968
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,317
PROTECTION CLAUSE, THE FACT 

1969
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:24,721
THAT IT UNDERSTOOD THE REAL-

1970
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,789
WORLD CONSEQUENCES OF THE 

1971
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:27,757
SEGREGATION ON THE AFRICAN-

1972
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:29,225
AMERICAN STUDENTS WHO WERE 

1973
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:32,595
SEGREGATED INTO OTHER SCHOOLS 

1974
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:34,430
AND STAMPED WITH A BADGE OF 

1975
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:37,233
INFERIORITY, THAT MOMENT IN 

1976
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:38,334
BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION 

1977
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:41,236
IS SO CRITICAL TO REMEMBER AND 

1978
01:00:41,236 --> 01:00:42,739
THE OPINION IS SO 

1979
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:43,106
INSPIRATIONAL. 

1980
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:44,640
I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE -- IT'S A 

1981
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,142
RELATIVE SHORT OPINION, BUT 

1982
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,944
IT'S VERY POWERFUL, IT'S VERY 

1983
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:50,246
FOCUSED ON THE TEXT OF THE 

1984
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:53,182
EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE AND 

1985
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:55,385
CORRECTING -- IN CORRECTING 

1986
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:57,220
THAT AWFUL PRECEDENT OF PLESSI 

1987
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,421
VERSUS FERGUSON, A GREAT 

1988
01:00:58,421 --> 01:00:59,355
EXAMPLE OF LEADERSHIP. 

1989
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:01,023
AND THE LAST POINT I'LL MENTION 

1990
01:01:01,023 --> 01:01:03,893
ON PROCESS, THEY KNEW THEY WERE 

1991
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:04,794
GOING TO FACE POPULAR BACKLASH. 

1992
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:07,363
THEY KNEW IT, BUT THEY STILL 

1993
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:08,965
DID IT, SO THAT SHOWS 

1994
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,433
INDEPENDENCE AND FORTITUDE, BUT 

1995
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:11,334
THEY ALSO HAD REARGUMENT WHICH 

1996
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,870
I THINK IS A GOOD -- THEY HAD 

1997
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:14,871
ARGUMENT ORIGINALLY AND THEN 

1998
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,405
DECIDED THERE'S A LOT GOING ON 

1999
01:01:16,405 --> 01:01:17,306
AND MAYBE NOT EVERYONE IS 

2000
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:18,541
SEEING IT THE SAME WAY, THE 

2001
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:19,842
JUSTICES AND THEY HAD A 

2002
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,577
REARGUMENT WHICH I THINK IS A 

2003
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:22,211
GOOD LESSON ON PROCESS 

2004
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:24,113
PROTECTING US AND KEEP WORKING 

2005
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:25,615
AT IT AND KEEP WORKING AT IT 

2006
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:27,917
AND SEE, YOU KNOW, THE 250E78 

2007
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:30,586
OF NINE I MENTIONED -- THE TEAM 

2008
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:31,788
OF NINE I MENTIONED YESTERDAY 

2009
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:32,622
AND MENTIONED TODAY, KEEP 

2010
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:37,093
WORKING ON IT AS A TEAM OF NINE 

2011
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:37,794
AND THEY CAME OUT UNANIMOUS. 

2012
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:41,664
THAT WAS THE GREATEST MOMENT IN 

2013
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:43,332
THE SUPREME COURT HISTORY. 

2014
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:44,033
>> THANK YOU, JUDGE. 

2015
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:44,934
>> THANK YOU. 

2016
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:46,435
I AWARDED TWO ADDITIONAL 

2017
01:01:46,435 --> 01:01:48,304
MINUTES TO SENATOR CORNYN 

2018
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:51,340
BECAUSE HE WAS INTRUMENTED FIVE 

2019
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,408
TIMES DURING HIS TESTIMONY. 

2020
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:53,276
SENATOR WHITEHOUSE IS NEXT. 

2021
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:53,843
>> THANK YOU. 

2022
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:54,310
GOOD AFTERNOON, JUDGE 

2023
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:54,610
KAVANAUGH. 

2024
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:54,944
>> SENATOR. 

2025
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:58,013
>> ARE YOU GOOD FOR ANOTHER 

2026
01:01:58,013 --> 01:01:59,015
HALF HOUR? 

2027
01:01:59,015 --> 01:01:59,348
>> I'M GOOD. 

2028
01:01:59,348 --> 01:01:59,882
>> ALL RIGHT, GOOD. 

2029
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:04,387
IN MY OFFICE, YOU TOLD ME THAT 

2030
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,456
YOU COULD PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE 

2031
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:08,558
TO ME THAT YOU'D UPHOLD A 

2032
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,660
STATUTE REQUIRING INSURANCE 

2033
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,694
COMPANIES TO PROVIDE COVERAGE 

2034
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:19,669
FOR PRE-EXISTING MEDICAL 

2035
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:19,969
CONDITIONS. 

2036
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:20,570
IS THAT STILL TRUE HERE IN 

2037
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:20,803
PUBLIC? 

2038
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:22,004
SENATOR, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT 

2039
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,706
TO UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLE IN 

2040
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:24,006
PLAY HERE. 

2041
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:25,708
>> WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT 

2042
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:25,908
THAT. 

2043
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:26,842
BUT THE STATEMENT I'VE MADE -- 

2044
01:02:26,842 --> 01:02:29,178
HAVE I RECITED IT ACCURATE AND 

2045
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:32,415
IS IT STILL TRUE TODAY THAT YOU 

2046
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,816
WOULD GIVE NO ASSURANCE THAT 

2047
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:34,183
YOU'D UPHOLD -- 

2048
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:35,017
>> JUDGES LIKE TO EXPLAIN. 

2049
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:37,320
>> UCIAL YOU GET TO ASK THE 

2050
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,187
QUESTIONS BECAUSE YOU'RE THE 

2051
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:40,590
APPELLATE JUDGE, BUT TODAY FOR 

2052
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,491
HALF HOUR I GET TO. 

2053
01:02:42,491 --> 01:02:45,561
SO IS IT STILL TRUE THAT YOU 

2054
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:48,197
CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCE THAT YOU 

2055
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:51,033
WOULD UPHOLD A STATUTE 

2056
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:52,201
REQUIRING INSURANCE COMPANIES 

2057
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:53,236
TO COVER PRE-EXISTING MEDICAL 

2058
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:53,536
CONDITIONS? 

2059
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:55,338
>> SO TO PREPARE FOR THIS 

2060
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:56,806
MOMENT, I WENT BACK AND READ -- 

2061
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:58,140
>> I REALLY WOULD LIKE YOU TO 

2062
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,642
BE AS CAREFUL WITH YOUR TIME AS 

2063
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:02,645
YOU CAN BECAUSE I HAVE A VERY 

2064
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,146
LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME WITH 

2065
01:03:04,146 --> 01:03:04,680
YOU. 

2066
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,315
SO THE QUICKER YOU CAN GET TO 

2067
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:09,752
THE ANSWER, IT COULD BE AS 

2068
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,187
SIMPLE AS YES OR NO. 

2069
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:12,154
>> BUT I CAN ENHANCE YOUR 

2070
01:03:12,154 --> 01:03:13,723
UNDERSTANDING OF MY ANSWER IF I 

2071
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:14,356
EXPLAIN IT, I THINK. 

2072
01:03:14,356 --> 01:03:16,125
>> I REALLY JUST WANT YOUR 

2073
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,126
ANSWER ON THE RECORD. 

2074
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:22,231
I THINK I'M PRETTY CAPABLE OF 

2075
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:23,265
UNDERSTANDING IT ON MY OWN. 

2076
01:03:23,265 --> 01:03:25,234
>> I WANT EVERYONE TO 

2077
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:26,068
UNDERSTAND MY ANSWER. 

2078
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:26,969
SO THERE'S NOMINEE PRECEDENT OF 

2079
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,272
HOW JUSTICES AND NOMINEES IN MY 

2080
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:31,107
POSITION HAVE ANSWERED IN THE 

2081
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:31,307
PAST. 

2082
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:33,342
I'LL BE SUCCINCT IF I CAN, AND 

2083
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:34,109
ALL EIGHT SITTING JUSTICES -- 

2084
01:03:34,109 --> 01:03:34,710
>> I KNOW. 

2085
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,412
YOU ACTUALLY SAID THIS IN THE 

2086
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,948
HEARING SO PEOPLE WHO ARE 

2087
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:40,349
LISTENING AND INTERESTED HAVE 

2088
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:41,651
ACTUALLY ALREADY HEARD YOU SAY 

2089
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:41,884
THIS. 

2090
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:43,052
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S REALLY 

2091
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:43,586
IMPORTANT SO -- 

2092
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:44,987
>> SAY IT AGAIN. 

2093
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:45,921
>> I WANT TO UNDERSCORE IT. 

2094
01:03:45,921 --> 01:03:47,790
ALL EIGHT SITS JUSTICES OF THE 

2095
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:50,927
SUPREME COURT HAVE MADE CLEAR 

2096
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:53,229
THAT IT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT 

2097
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:54,330
WITH JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE 

2098
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,065
ROOTED IN OUR ARTICLE 3 TO 

2099
01:03:56,065 --> 01:04:00,002
PROVIDE ANSWERS ON CASES OR 

2100
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:02,038
ISSUES THAT COULD COME BEFORE 

2101
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:02,505
US. 

2102
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:03,873
JUSTICE GINSBURG NO HINTS 

2103
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:04,840
FORECAST, JUSTICE KAGAN TALKING 

2104
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,776
ABOUT PRECEDENT, NO THUMBS UP 

2105
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:07,677
AND DOWN. 

2106
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,344
I WENT BACK. 

2107
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,144
JUDGE THOROUGH GOOD MARSHALL 

2108
01:04:09,144 --> 01:04:10,246
WAS ASKED REPEATEDLY IN HIS 

2109
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,747
HEARING, WHAT DO YOU THINK 

2110
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:12,848
ABOUT MIRANDA, WHAT DO YOU 

2111
01:04:12,848 --> 01:04:14,517
THINK ABOUT MIRANDA, WHAT DO 

2112
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,384
YOU THINK ABOUT MIRANDA. 

2113
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:16,352
>> I GOT IT. 

2114
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,487
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES IT AND YOUR 

2115
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:18,954
ANSWER IS STILL NO. 

2116
01:04:18,954 --> 01:04:21,958
>> BUT THE REASON EVERYONE ELSE 

2117
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:24,660
DOES IT IS ROOTED IN -- IT'S MY 

2118
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:25,461
RESPECT FOR NOMINEE PRECEDENT 

2119
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:26,595
AND MY RESPECT FOR JUDICIAL 

2120
01:04:26,595 --> 01:04:28,531
INDEPENDENCE, SO I CAN'T GIVE 

2121
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,633
ASSURANCES ON A SPECIFIC 

2122
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:31,000
HYPOTHETICAL -- 

2123
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,267
>> OKAY. 

2124
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:31,567
THANK YOU. 

2125
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:38,875
LET ME GO ON TO ANOTHER SUBJECT 

2126
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:39,608
WHICH IS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. 

2127
01:04:39,608 --> 01:04:40,676
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IS A 

2128
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:43,045
PRINCIPLE THAT IS FOUMEDDED IN 

2129
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:43,946
THE CONSTITUTION IN THE 

2130
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:44,780
SEPARATION OF POWERS, CORRECT? 

2131
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,749
>> THE SUPREME COURT SO RULED 

2132
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:48,117
IN THE UNITED STATES VERSUS 

2133
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:48,550
RICHARD NIXON CASE. 

2134
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:50,152
SO THAT WAS THE FIRST -- THE 

2135
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:51,453
KY ISSUE IN UNITED STATES -- 

2136
01:04:51,453 --> 01:04:52,021
>> THAT'S ALL RIGHT. 

2137
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:56,058
I JUST NEEDED THE ANSWER TO THE 

2138
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,360
QUESTION AND YOU'VE ANSWERED 

2139
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:58,527
IT. 

2140
01:04:58,527 --> 01:04:59,328
>> THE SOURCE IS IMPORTANT. 

2141
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:01,163
>> THE -- AS A PRIVILEGE IT 

2142
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:08,938
NEEDS TO BE ASSERTED, DOES IT 

2143
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:11,007
NOT, THAT'S TRUE OF PRIVILEGES 

2144
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:11,307
GENERALLY? 

2145
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:13,643
>> I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS IS 

2146
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:14,676
GOING -- PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD 

2147
01:05:14,676 --> 01:05:14,943
QUESTION. 

2148
01:05:14,943 --> 01:05:17,946
DON'T PRIVILEGES NEED TO BE 

2149
01:05:17,946 --> 01:05:18,914
ASSERTED IN ORDER TO APPLY? 

2150
01:05:18,914 --> 01:05:20,282
>> WELL, PRIVILEGES ARE 

2151
01:05:20,282 --> 01:05:20,615
RECOGNIZED -- 

2152
01:05:20,615 --> 01:05:21,349
>> ONCE THEY'RE ASSERTED. 

2153
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:23,285

PROPOSITION. 

2155
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:24,887
>> FAIR ENOUGH. 

2156
01:05:24,887 --> 01:05:26,856
I'M ONLY ASKING AS A GENERAL 

2157
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:27,189
PROPOSITION. 

2158
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:28,557
>> IN AN ATTORNEY/CLIENT 

2159
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:31,460
PRIVILEGE YOU WOULD ASSERT THE 

2160
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:31,760
PRIVILEGE. 

2161
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,828
>> AND WHO EXERTS EXECUTIVE 

2162
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:33,128
PRIVILEGE? 

2163
01:05:33,128 --> 01:05:35,798
>> ORDINARILY -- WELL, THAT IS 

2164
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:38,701
A COMPLICATED QUESTION, 

2165
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:39,268
SENATOR. 

2166
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:39,968
ACTUALLY -- 

2167
01:05:39,968 --> 01:05:42,338
>> WHO DOES IT COME BACK TO? 

2168
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:43,272
ULTIMATELY WHO ASSERTS 

2169
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:43,839
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE? 

2170
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,141
>> SO IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE 

2171
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:50,012
TALKING ABOUT, SO WHAT KIND OF 

2172
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:50,779
EXECUTIVE BRANCH DOCUMENT 

2173
01:05:50,779 --> 01:05:51,380
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, IT 

2174
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:51,647
DEPENDS. 

2175
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:52,782
IN MY EXPERIENCE -- 

2176
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,450
>> ULTIMATELY IT'S THE 

2177
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,584
PRESIDENT. 

2178
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:58,421
>> THERE'S NOT AS MUCH 

2179
01:05:58,421 --> 01:05:59,187
PRECEDENT ON THAT. 

2180
01:05:59,187 --> 01:05:59,588
THERE'S SOME. 

2181
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:00,623
IN THE SUPREME COURT, THIS WAS 

2182
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,291
-- THE SUPREME COURT IN THE 

2183
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,626
UNITED STATES VERSUS RICHARD 

2184
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:03,892
NIXON -- 

2185
01:06:03,892 --> 01:06:05,461
>> ISN'T IT FAIR TO SAY THAT 

2186
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,196
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE BELONGS TO 

2187
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:10,032
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

2188
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:11,067
STATES, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE? 

2189
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:12,601
>> YEAH, IT CAN ALSO BELONG TO 

2190
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,370
THE FORMER PRESIDENT IN THE 

2191
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:15,237
CASE OF FORMER PRESIDENTIAL 

2192
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:20,142
RECORDS, THAT'S ONE CAVEAT I 

2193
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:23,012
WANT TO PUT ON THAT. 

2194
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:24,480
>> FAIR CAVEAT. 

2195
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:29,318
IS THE ASSERTION OF EXECUTIVE 

2196
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,554
PRIVILEGE BY THE PRESIDENT 

2197
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:32,888
SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW? 

2198
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:34,323
>> WELL, OF COURSE BECAUSE 

2199
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,092
UNDER THE PRECEDENT, UNITED 

2200
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:37,326
STATES VERSUS RICHARD NIXON 

2201
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:38,327
SAID TWO THINGS. 

2202
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:41,230
IT SAID, ONE, THE EXECUTIVE 

2203
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:41,963
PRIVILEGE IS CONSTITUTIONALLY 

2204
01:06:41,963 --> 01:06:42,197
ROOTED. 

2205
01:06:42,197 --> 01:06:43,265
THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IN THAT 

2206
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:44,100
CASE ACTUALLY ARGUED THERE IS 

2207
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,234
NO SUCH THING AS EXECUTIVE 

2208
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:46,001
PRIVILEGE AND THE SUPREME COURT 

2209
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:47,503
REJECTED THAT ARGUMENT AND HELD 

2210
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,638
THAT THE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IS 

2211
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:51,240
ROOTED IN THE SEPARATION OF 

2212
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,608
POWERS AND IN ARTICLE 2. BUT -- 

2213
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:53,776
>> THE REASON I'M ASKING 

2214
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:55,544
DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH 

2215
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:55,744
YOU. 

2216
01:06:55,744 --> 01:06:57,480
IT GOES BACK TO A POINT THAT WE 

2217
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,647
WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER IN 

2218
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:02,218
THE HEARING WHICH IS THAT WE 

2219
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:02,785
HAVE RECEIVED HUNDREDS AND 

2220
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:05,988
HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS 

2221
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:09,758
OF YOUR RECORD THAT LOOK LIKE 

2222
01:07:09,758 --> 01:07:12,128
THIS, THEY BOTH SAY COMMITTEE 

2223
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:15,264
CONFIDENTIAL ACROSS THEM AT AN 

2224
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:17,733
ANGLE, AND THEN ACROSS THE 

2225
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:18,768
FRONT THEY SAY CONSTITUTIONAL 

2226
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:19,935
PRIVILEGE AND AS A MEMBER OF 

2227
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,771
THE SENATE, THIS IS NOT A 

2228
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:23,672
QUESTION, I'M SPEAKING TO MY 

2229
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:26,942
COLLEAGUE, I FIND MYSELF IN A 

2230
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:28,344
QUANDARY HERE ABOUT BEING 

2231
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:30,879
DENIED THOSE PARTICULAR 

2232
01:07:30,879 --> 01:07:34,150
DOCUMENTS BECAUSE I CANNOT FIND 

2233
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,519
ANY ASSERTION OF THE PRIVILEGE, 

2234
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:37,219
THESE DOCUMENTS JUST SUDDENLY 

2235
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:39,155
APPEARED AND SOMEBODY HAD PUT 

2236
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:40,956
CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE ON THE 

2237
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:44,193
PAGE AND WIPED OUT ALL THE TEXT 

2238
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:46,095
THAT WAS ON THE PAGE, AND MY 

2239
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:49,065
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S 

2240
01:07:49,065 --> 01:08:26,535
ORDINARILY A PROCESS 

2241
01:08:48,857 --> 01:08:48,991
. 

2242
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:50,960
>> I DON'T THINK FORMAL 

2243
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,993
ASSERTIONS USUALLY OCCUR UNTIL 

2244
01:08:51,993 --> 01:08:53,929
AFTER THERE HAS BEEN A SUBPOENA 

2245
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:54,529
FROM MY TIME. 

2246
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:58,934
>> WHICH IS WHY NOT BEING ABLE 

2247
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:06,942
TO GET A SUBPOENA KIND OF  

2248
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:08,477
BALLICKS THE PROCESS.  

2249
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:09,812
THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL SOCIETY 

2250
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,046
IN BRINGING YOU HERE TODAY HAS 

2251
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:12,413
BEEN OF INTEREST TO ME.  

2252
01:09:12,413 --> 01:09:14,350
AS YOU KNOW WE SPOKE ABOUT IT A 

2253
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:20,990
LOT WHEN YOU AND I MET IN MY 

2254
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,390
OFFICE.  

2255
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:24,225
MR. GUNN SITTING VERY  

2256
01:09:24,225 --> 01:09:25,995
APPRECIATELY BEHIND YOU,  I CAN 

2257
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,831
SEE HIM OVER YOUR SHOULDER,  

2258
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,765
HAS SAID THE FEDERAL SOCIETY 

2259
01:09:30,765 --> 01:09:33,902
WAS INSOURCED INTO THE WHITE 

2260
01:09:33,902 --> 01:09:36,772

2261
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:37,573
SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE THE 

2262
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,040
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU SHOULD 

2263
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,242
BE THE NOMINEE.  

2264
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:42,011
YOU HAVE SAID THIS REGARDING 

2265
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,112
PRESIDENT  BUSH.  

2266
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:45,281
THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS,  AND I 

2267
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,750
AM  QUOTING HERE,  IMPROPER TO 

2268
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,818
GIVE ONE GROUP,  ESPECIALLY A 

2269
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:52,154
GROUP WITH INTERESTS IN MANY  

2270
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:56,258
ISSUES,  A PREFERRED OR FAVORED 

2271
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:57,259
POSITION IN THE NOMINATION 

2272
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:58,294
PROCESS.  

2273
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:02,931
THAT WAS -- THOSE WERE YOUR 

2274
01:10:02,931 --> 01:10:04,266
WORDS SPEAKING TO THE FEDERAL 

2275
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:08,437
SOCIETY,  THE NATIONAL LAWYER'S 

2276
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:10,039
CONVENTION.  

2277
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:12,841
ON ANOTHER OCCASION YOU WROTE A 

2278
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:14,410
DRAFT SPEECH FOR ATTORNEY 

2279
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:15,344

GONZALEZ LOOKING AT THE DATE,  

2283
01:10:19,214 --> 01:10:20,616
TO DELIVER TO THE FEDERALIST 

2284
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:21,050
SOCIETY.  

2285
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:24,820
YOU SAID IN THAT SPEECH,  AS A 

2286
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:25,420
MATTER OF CONSTITUTIONAL 

2287
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:26,889
PRINCIPLE,  IT IS SIMPLY 

2288
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:30,259
INPROPER,  WE BELIEVE,  TO 

2289
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:31,760
AFFORD ANY OUTSIDE GROUP A 

2290
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,497
QUASI OFFICIAL ROLE IN THE 

2291
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:43,639
PRESIDENT'S NOMINATION PROCESS. 

2292
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,074
HOW DO YOU SQUARE THOSE TWO 

2293
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:49,745
ROLES WITH THE ROLE IN YOUR 

2294
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,380
NOMINATION PROCESS,  ASSUMING 

2295
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:56,418
MR. McGUNN HAD BEEN SPEAKING 

2296
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:56,718
ACCURATELY. 

2297
01:10:56,718 --> 01:10:58,554
>> I CAN SPEAK TO THE  ADA PART 

2298
01:10:58,554 --> 01:10:59,121
OF THAT.  

2299
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:00,756
PRESIDENT BUSH  IN 2001 HAD TO 

2300
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:03,359
MAKE A DECISION HOW THE ADA 

2301
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:04,526
SHOULD PLAY ITS USUAL RATING 

2302
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:08,197
ROLE WITH RESPECT TO NOMINEES 

2303
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,866
AND THE ADA TAKES FILES AND 

2304
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:13,102
BRIEFS AND POLICY POSITIONS ON 

2305
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,137
ISSUES,  AND THEREFORE,  AFTER 

2306
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:16,572
SOME DELIBERATION IT WAS 

2307
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:19,108
DECIDED THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG 

2308
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,777
WITH THE  ADA RATING THE 

2309
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:23,712
NOMINEES BUT TO GIVE THE 

2310
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:25,681
ORGANIZATION THAT FILES THE 

2311
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:28,450
MICA BRIEFS AND  TAKES POLICY 

2312
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,953
POSITIONS A PREFERRED ROLE IN 

2313
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:31,686
THE CONSTITUTION NOMINATION 

2314
01:11:31,686 --> 01:11:33,188
PROCESS WAS UNFAIR IN SOME WAYS 

2315
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:33,988
IN FAVORING IT. 

2316
01:11:33,988 --> 01:11:36,692
>> A FAIR DESCRIPTION OF THE 

2317
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:38,026
FEDERALIST SOCIETY'S ROLE IN 

2318
01:11:38,026 --> 01:11:39,428
YOUR SELECTION AS THE NOMINEE 

2319
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:44,967
TO SAY IT WAS PREFERRED OVER 

2320
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:45,300
OTHER GROUPS? 

2321
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:45,901
>> WELL,  MY EXPERIENCE WAS 

2322
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,369
WHEN JUSTICE KENNEDY RETIRED ON 

2323
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:49,405
THE  WEDNESDAY, MR. MCGAHN 

2324
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:51,139
CALLED ME LATER THAT AFTERNOON 

2325
01:11:51,139 --> 01:11:52,374
AND SAID WE NEED TO TALK ON 

2326
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:53,275
FRIDAY.  

2327
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:54,943
HE CAME OVER TO MY OFFICE ON 

2328
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:56,578
FRIDAY  EVENING,  OR LATE 

2329
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:57,112
AFTERNOON.  

2330
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:59,781
WE TALKED FOR THREE OR FOUR 

2331
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:01,417
HOURS.  

2332
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:02,918
INTERVIEW AND GOING THROUGH THE 

2333
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:04,153
USUAL KINDS OF QUESTIONS YOU 

2334
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,021
WOULD GO THROUGH WHEN YOU ARE 

2335
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:07,256
EMBARKING ON A PROCESS LIKE 

2336
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:07,489
THIS.  

2337
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:11,126
I MET WITH THE INTERVIEW WITH 

2338
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:12,861
THE PRESIDENT ON MONDAY MORNING 

2339
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:13,028
-- 

2340
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:14,596
>> IT YOUR TESTIMONY THAT YOU 

2341
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,365
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ROLE OF THE 

2342
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:20,769
FEDERALIST SOCIETY WAS IN YOUR 

2343
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:21,069
SELECTION? 

2344
01:12:21,069 --> 01:12:22,437
>> MY EXPERIENCE OF MY PERSONAL 

2345
01:12:22,437 --> 01:12:25,941
EXPERIENCE AND WHAT I KNOW IS 

2346
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:28,943
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE THE 

2347
01:12:28,943 --> 01:12:29,812
DECISION FOR STARTERS.  

2348
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:32,581
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE THE 

2349
01:12:32,581 --> 01:12:33,115
NOMINATION.  

2350
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:34,515
I KNOW,  AS HE EXPLAINED 

2351
01:12:34,515 --> 01:12:36,885
YESTERDAY,  I KNOW HE SPENT A 

2352
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:38,987
LOT OF TIME IN THOSE 12 DAYS ON 

2353
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:43,759
THIS ISSUE AND I WAS AWARE OF 

2354
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:44,460
THAT.  

2355
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,728
I ALSO KNOW THAT MR. MCGAHN WAS 

2356
01:12:46,728 --> 01:12:47,763
DIRECTLY INVOLVED WHERE ME AND 

2357
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:49,498
SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON IT.  

2358
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:50,632
I ALSO KNOW THE VICE PRESIDENT 

2359
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:50,832
-- 

2360
01:12:50,832 --> 01:12:51,667
>> YOU HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE TO 

2361
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,001
SHARE WITH US TODAY ABOUT THE 

2362
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:55,637
ROLE OF THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 

2363
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:56,872
AND HOW THEY WERE INSOURCED 

2364
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,774
INTO THE WHITE HOUSE? 

2365
01:12:58,774 --> 01:12:59,908
THAT IS A MYSTERY TO YOU AS 

2366
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:01,109
WELL AS TO US? 

2367
01:13:01,109 --> 01:13:03,812
>> I AM NOT SURE WHAT MR. 

2368
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:06,281
MCGAHN MEANT BY THAT COMMENT.  

2369
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:09,585
I THINK FEDERAL SOCIETY MEMBERS 

2370
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:11,386
ARE -- THE LAWYERS IN THE 

2371
01:13:11,386 --> 01:13:12,421
ADMINISTRATION ARE FEDERAL 

2372
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,990
SOCIETY MEMBERS,  SO IT SHOULD 

2373
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,526
NOT BE A SURPRISE THAT BECAUSE 

2374
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:19,394
IT IS AN ORGANIZATION. 

2375
01:13:19,394 --> 01:13:20,596
>> LEARNED LEO'S ROLE 

2376
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:21,763
SPECIFICALLY FROM THE 

2377
01:13:21,763 --> 01:13:22,230
FEDERALIST SOCIETY? 

2378
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:23,332
>> I DON'T KNOW. 

2379
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:23,565
>> OKA 

2380
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:26,034
>> I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS. 

2381
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:29,571
>> WELL,  LET'S GO FROM 

2382
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:33,408
SPECIFICS TO GENERALS AND LET 

2383
01:13:33,408 --> 01:13:35,277
ME PUT UP A GRAPHIC THAT SHOWS 

2384
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:39,181
SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO FUND THE 

2385
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:44,453
FEDERALISTS SOCIETY.  

2386
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:46,989
IT IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT 

2387
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:49,458
GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT SEND TO 

2388
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,325
SHARE CONSERVATIVE AND PRO-

2389
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:53,061
CORPORATE POINTS OF VIEW.  

2390
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:54,396
IT REFLECTS THAT AT LEAST 14 OF 

2391
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:56,665
THE  DONORS ARE ACTUALLY 

2392
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:58,700
ANONYMOUS WHICH IS A VERY 

2393
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,235
UNFORTUNATE PART OF OUR CURRENT 

2394
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:02,437
POLITICAL WORLD.  

2395
01:14:02,437 --> 01:14:05,307
PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT,  

2396
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:07,676
BECAUSE DONORS TRUST HERE IS AN 

2397
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:08,443
ORGANIZATION WHOSE SOLE SUPER 

2398
01:14:08,443 --> 01:14:10,312
IS TO LAUNDER THE IDENTITY OFF 

2399
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:12,514
OF BIG DONORS SO THAT A 

2400
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:14,049
RECIPIENT OF FUNDS CAN REPORT 

2401
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:16,285
THAT THEY GOT THE MONEY FROM 

2402
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:17,319
DONOR'S TRUST RATHER THAN THE 

2403
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:18,954
TRUE PARTY IN INTEREST,  SO WE 

2404
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:21,323
DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH ANONYMOUS 

2405
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:23,458
MONEY FLOWED THROUGH THEM.  

2406
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:27,629
BUT I WOULD CONTEND THAT THIS 

2407
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:30,299
IS A PRETTY STRONG GROUP OF 

2408
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,299
RIGHT-WINGED CONSERVATIVE  PRO-

2409
01:14:31,299 --> 01:14:31,733
CORPORATE FUNDERS. 

2410
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:41,210
AND PRESUMING THAT TO BE TRUE,  

2411
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:45,513
SHOULD THAT GIVE YOU OR ANYONE 

2412
01:14:45,513 --> 01:14:47,349
IN THIS PROCESS PAUSE THAT 

2413
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:50,419
GROUPS LIKE THIS MAY HAVE HAD 

2414
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:51,920
SUCH A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN 

2415
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:58,460
SELECTING YOU TO BE IN THIS 

2416
01:14:58,460 --> 01:14:58,760
SEAT TODAY? 

2417
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,195
>> SENATOR,  MR. MCGAHN WAS THE 

2418
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:02,164
ONE WHO  CONTACTED ME.  

2419
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,465
I INTERVIEWED WITH THE 

2420
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:05,366
PRESIDENT AND I KNOW THE 

2421
01:15:05,366 --> 01:15:07,336
PRESIDENT WAS,  I AM THE 

2422
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,437
PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE.  

2423
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:09,537
HE WAS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN 

2424
01:15:09,537 --> 01:15:12,540
MAKING THAT DECISION.  

2425
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,876
I AM SURE HE CONSULTED WITH MR. 

2426
01:15:14,876 --> 01:15:15,310
MCGAHN.  

2427
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,779
I AM SURE HE CONSULTED VERY 

2428
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:19,247
WIDELY TO GET INPUT AT LEAST ON 

2429
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:20,882
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE FINALISTS,  

2430
01:15:20,882 --> 01:15:23,752
SO THAT THAT PART OF IT,  MY  

2431
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:26,388
12-DAY EXPERIENCE,  WAS WITH 

2432
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:29,358
THE WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL'S 

2433
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:32,094
OFFICE AND THE PRESIDENT AND 

2434
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:35,497
2nd  BASE,  TOO,  SO,  I AM NOT 

2435
01:15:35,497 --> 01:15:37,065
FAMILIAR WITH THE RULES -- 

2436
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:38,767
>> DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT THE 

2437
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:40,001
ROLES OF THE  FEDERALIST 

2438
01:15:40,001 --> 01:15:41,136
SOCIETY WAS IN ALL THIS -- 

2439
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:42,938
THERE IS PLENTY OF REPORTING,  

2440
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:44,473
WE DON'T NEED TO LITIGATE THAT 

2441
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:45,907
BETWEEN US,  YOU DON'T KNOW YOU 

2442
01:15:45,907 --> 01:15:47,342
TESTIFIED AND THAT IS FINE. 

2443
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:49,811
>> MY PROCESS,  AND AGAIN,  YE 

2444
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:51,346
>> BUT YOU ARE FAIRLY FAMILIAR 

2445
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:52,080
WITH THE PROCESS GENERALLY 

2446
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,649
BECAUSE YOU USED  TO RUN IT IN 

2447
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:54,883
THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE,  OR HAVE 

2448
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:58,754
A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN IT,  THE 

2449
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:00,789
PROCESS OF JUDICIAL NOMINATION 

2450
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:03,959
SELECTION,  JUDICIAL NOMINEE 

2451
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:05,760
SELECTION,  CORRECT? 

2452
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,928
>> I DID NOT RUN IT.  

2453
01:16:06,928 --> 01:16:08,797
JUDGE GONZALEZ WHEN I WAS IN 

2454
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:10,064
THE COUNCIL'S OFFICE WAS THE 

2455
01:16:10,064 --> 01:16:10,365
COUNCIL -- 

2456
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:13,068
>> BUT YOU HAVE BEEN INSIDE THE 

2457
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:13,335
PROCESS? 

2458
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:14,570
>> I HAVE BEEN INSIDE THE 

2459
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:14,970
PROCESS,  YES. 

2460
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:17,472
>> SO,  THE NEXT THING THAT 

2461
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:22,544
HAPPENS GOING FORWARD IS THAT 

2462
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:24,980
WE SEE THE JUDICIAL CRISIS  

2463
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:27,683
NETWORK SHOWING UP AND THEY 

2464
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:30,118
SPEND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND 

2465
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:35,624
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO RUN ADS  

2466
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:39,161
URGING SENATORS TO SUPPORT YOU. 

2467
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:41,229
NOW,  I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN 

2468
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:43,198
SHOW THOSE ARE THE SAME FUNDERS 

2469
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:44,533
BECAUSE THEY ARE ENGAGED,  AS 

2470
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:45,767
YOU KNOW,  IN DARK MONEY 

2471
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:46,601
FUNDING.  

2472
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:47,703
THEY DON'T REPORT THEIR DONORS, 

2473
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:49,838
BUT I WOULD BE PREPARED  TO 

2474
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:52,274
MAKE A VERY SUBSTANTIAL BET 

2475
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:53,709
THAT THERE IS ENORMOUS OVERPASS 

2476
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:56,278
BETWEEN THE FUNDERS OF THE 

2477
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,213
JUDICIAL CRISIS NETWORK 

2478
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:00,482
CAMPAIGN FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION, 

2479
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:01,750
AND THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 

2480
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,151
DONOR GROUP TO THE EXTENT THAT 

2481
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:04,686
WE ARE AWARE OF AND SINCE SO 

2482
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:11,526
MANY OF THEM ARE ANONYMOUS.  

2483
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:14,296
HYPOTHETICALLY,  SHOULD THE 

2484
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,832
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE CONCERN 

2485
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:18,667
ABOUT THE ROLE OF VERY,  VERY 

2486
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:22,804
BIG  SPENDERS AND INFLUENCERS 

2487
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,139
DOING THINGS LIKE BEING 

2488
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,208
INVOLVED IN THE SELECTION OF A 

2489
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:27,609
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE AND  

2490
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:29,244
RUNNING DARK MONEY CAMPAIGNS TO 

2491
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:34,483
SUPPORT THE CONFIRMATION OF A 

2492
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:34,783
NOMINEE? 

2493
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:36,318
IS THERE ANY CAUSE FOR CONCERN 

2494
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:39,688
THERE AT A GENERAL  

2495
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:40,021
PROPOSITION? 

2496
01:17:40,021 --> 01:17:42,156
>> SIR,  THERE IS A LOT OF 

2497
01:17:42,156 --> 01:17:43,158
GENERAL PREMISES IN YOUR 

2498
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:45,427
QUESTION THAT I AM NOT SURE. 

2499
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:47,696
>> I AM ASKING YOU TO ACCEPT 

2500
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:49,197
THE HYPOTHETICAL.  

2501
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:50,932
IF THERE WERE VERY,  VERY 

2502
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:51,699
SIGNIFICANT BIG SPECIAL 

2503
01:17:51,699 --> 01:17:52,801
INTEREST FUNDING BEHIND THE 

2504
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:53,735
ORGANIZATION THAT WAS 

2505
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:54,769
RESPONSIBLE FOR SELECTING YOU 

2506
01:17:54,769 --> 01:17:56,571
AND RECOMMENDING TO THE 

2507
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:58,106
PRESIDENT THAT HE NOMINATE YOU, 

2508
01:17:58,106 --> 01:18:02,177
AND,  AGAIN,  FROM A VERY 

2509
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:03,512
SIMILAR GROUP IN  SUPPORTING 

2510
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:04,946
THE DARK MONEY CAMPAIGNS 

2511
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:06,615
RUNNING ON YOUR BEHALF FOR YOUR 

2512
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:07,949
CONFIRMATION,  WOULD THAT BE A 

2513
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:10,418
MATTER OF CONCERN,  OR IS THAT 

2514
01:18:10,418 --> 01:18:11,686
ALL JUST FINE AND WE SHOULDN'T 

2515
01:18:11,686 --> 01:18:13,522
EVEN CARE ABOUT GETTING THE  

2516
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:13,889
ANSWERS? 

2517
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:16,858
>> SO,  TWO THINGS,  SENATOR.  

2518
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:18,326
ONE IS DESCRIBE THE PROCESS I 

2519
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:20,394
WENT THROUGH WITH  MR. MCGAHN,  

2520
01:18:20,394 --> 01:18:21,329
THE PRESIDENT,  VICE PRESIDENT 

2521
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:22,197
AND THE SELECTION.  

2522
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:23,531
THAT IS WHAT I KNOW ABOUT MY 

2523
01:18:23,531 --> 01:18:24,332
PROCESS.  

2524
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:28,336
TWO,  ON THE ADS,  THERE ARE A 

2525
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:30,472
LOT OF ADS AGAINST ME AS WELL.  

2526
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:31,473
AND I HAVE SEEN THOSE.  

2527
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:34,408
AND,  YOU KNOW,  OUR FAMILIES 

2528
01:18:34,408 --> 01:18:35,777
HAVE SEEN THOSE.  

2529
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:37,512
AND THERE ARE ADS FOR ME AND WE 

2530
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:40,215
HAVE SEEN THOSE,  TOO.  

2531
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:40,949
AS CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS SAID 

2532
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:42,584
IN HIS HEARING,  IT IS A FREE 

2533
01:18:42,584 --> 01:18:44,319
COUNTRY AND THERE ARE ADS FOR 

2534
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,120
AND AGAINST AND OBVIOUSLY -- 

2535
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,789
>> SHOULD WE AS CITIZENS KNOW 

2536
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:48,623
WHO THEY ARE? 

2537
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:50,458
WHO IS FUNDING THE ADS,  JUST 

2538
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:52,126
AS A MATTER OF CITIZENSHIP? 

2539
01:18:52,126 --> 01:18:54,196
>> I THINK THAT IS FIRST AND 

2540
01:18:54,196 --> 01:18:55,197
FOREMOST A POLICY QUESTION FOR 

2541
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:57,198
THE CONGRESS TO DECIDE ON WHAT 

2542
01:18:57,198 --> 01:18:57,832
DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS IT 

2543
01:18:57,832 --> 01:18:59,367
WANTS TO PUT IN.  

2544
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:01,803
AND IF THOSE DISCLOSURE 

2545
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:03,638
REQUIREMENTS WERE PUT IN OR 

2546
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:06,941
STATE GOVERNMENTS COULD TRY TO 

2547
01:19:06,941 --> 01:19:07,909
MAKE DISCLOSURE RETIREMENTS,  

2548
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:10,478
THEY COULD TRY IT AND THIS WILL 

2549
01:19:10,478 --> 01:19:12,046
BE -- REQUIREMENTS AND THEY 

2550
01:19:12,046 --> 01:19:14,282
COULD TRY IT AND THERE WOULD 

2551
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:15,650
UNDOUBTLY BE CHALLENGES TO THAT 

2552
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:16,551
AND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE 

2553
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:18,620
TO THAT,  THAT WOULD COME TO 

2554
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,655
THE OPEN COURT AND I WOULD KEEP 

2555
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:24,259
AN OPEN MIND ON THAT UNDER THE 

2556
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:25,560
PRECEDENT AND FIRST AMENDMENT 

2557
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:25,960
LAW.  

2558
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,596
THE POLICY IS TO FIRST 

2559
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,464
DETERMINE,  ASSESS AND STUDY 

2560
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:30,899
EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF DISCLOSURE 

2561
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:32,167
REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE PUT IN 

2562
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:32,467
PLACE. 

2563
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:33,768
>> I UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL 

2564
01:19:33,768 --> 01:19:35,403
HAZARD THERE.  

2565
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:39,174
IS IT THE UNLEASHED POWER OF 

2566
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:41,643
UNLIMITED POLITICAL DARK MONEY 

2567
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:45,446
THEN BECOMES LIKE A RATCHET.  

2568
01:19:45,446 --> 01:19:46,348
THE OBSTACLE TO SOLVING THAT 

2569
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:46,648
PROBLEM.  

2570
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:49,417
I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT 

2571
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:53,988
AS A MATTER OF POLITICADO INSTA 

2572
01:19:53,988 --> 01:19:58,593
ABOUT MONEY IN THE POLITICAL 

2573
01:19:58,593 --> 01:19:58,893
SYSTEM.  

2574
01:19:58,893 --> 01:20:01,263
MY WORK FOR,  AND THE TIME IT 

2575
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:04,432
TAKES ALL OF  YOU,  AND WHEN I 

2576
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:09,604
WORKED FOR PRESIDENT BUSH IN 

2577
01:20:09,604 --> 01:20:11,439
THE '03-'04 TIMEFRAME,  FOR 

2578
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:12,474
EXAMPLE,  HOW MANY FUNDRAISER 

2579
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:16,378
HE HAD TO DO GOING BACK TO THE 

2580
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:20,382
SEPTEMBER 11 POINT,  HE HAD TO 

2581
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:23,918
DO A LOT OF FOLLOWED UPPING FOR 

2582
01:20:23,918 --> 01:20:24,519
BEING PRESIDENT WHILE BOROUGH 

2583
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:24,819
PRESIDENT. 

2584
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:28,156
>> NOW YOU CAN SET UP A 501C4 

2585
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:30,392
AND DROP TENS OF MILLIONS OF 

2586
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:32,427
DOLLARS,  LIKE THAT,  DROP IT 

2587
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:33,728
AND THE PUBLIC DOESN'T KNOW WHO 

2588
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:36,597
IS BEHIND IT.  

2589
01:20:36,597 --> 01:20:38,266
ONLY VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE 

2590
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:41,769
GOTTEN IN ON IT.  

2591
01:20:41,769 --> 01:20:42,771
IT HAS GOTTEN EASIER SINCE 

2592
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:43,538
PRESIDENT BUSH BUT NOT BETTER. 

2593
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:45,406
>> IF YOU ARE RUNNING FOR RE-

2594
01:20:45,406 --> 01:20:46,341
ELECTION AND A THIRD PARTY 

2595
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:47,409
GROUP COMES  IN AGAINST YOU,  

2596
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:51,012
YOU HAVE TO GO OUT IN THE 

2597
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:51,712
FUNDRAISING AND SPEND EVEN MORE 

2598
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:53,515
TIME,  THAT IS PART OF THE 

2599
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:54,749
CONCERN I HEARD OVER THE YEARS 

2600
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:56,418
GENERALLY IS THE TIME THAT EACH 

2601
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:59,387
OF YOU HAS TO SPEND,  AND THE 

2602
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:00,888
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE -- 

2603
01:21:00,888 --> 01:21:02,357
>> LET ME CONTINUE ON FORWARD 

2604
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:03,391
THROUGH THIS PROBLEM OF 

2605
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:03,557
FUNDERS.  

2606
01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:09,130
ON THE COURT,  ON THE D.C. 

2607
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:10,832
CIRCUIT AND POTENTIALLY ON THE 

2608
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:14,035
SUPREME COURT,  YOU WILL OFTEN 

2609
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:14,635
SEE CASES BROUGHT BY GROUPS 

2610
01:21:14,635 --> 01:21:15,970
LIKE,  FOR INSTANCE,  THE 

2611
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:17,372
PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION.  

2612
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:19,908
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT 

2613
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:20,642
GROUP? 

2614
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:22,477
>> I HAVE SEEN BRIEFS BY THE 

2615
01:21:22,477 --> 01:21:23,111
PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION. 

2616
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:26,747
>> DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO? 

2617
01:21:26,747 --> 01:21:30,385
>> I WILL TAKE YOUR 

2618
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:31,186
DESCRIPTION. 

2619
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:34,122
>> MY DESCRIPTION IS THAT THEY 

2620
01:21:34,122 --> 01:21:36,291
GET MONEY FROM RIGHT-WINGED 

2621
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:37,425
CONSERVATIVE AND CORPORATE 

2622
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:40,295
INTERESTS AND THEY LOOK FOR 

2623
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:42,330
CASES AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT 

2624
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:45,800
THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN USE TO 

2625
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,435
BRING ARGUMENTS BEFORE THE 

2626
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:48,036
COURT.  

2627
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:49,738
I ARGUED AGAINST THEM IN THE 

2628
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,506
SUPREME COURT AT ONE POINT.  

2629
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:54,142
THEY CAME ALL THE WAY ACROSS 

2630
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:59,748
THE COUNTRY TO THE SHORES OF 

2631
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:01,149
WINNEPAUK POND,  RHODE ISLAND,  

2632
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:03,785
TO HIRE A CLIENT WHOSE CASE 

2633
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:05,020
THEY COULD TAKE TO THE SUPREME 

2634
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:06,187
COURT WITH A PURPOSE TO MAKE A 

2635
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:07,188
POINT.  

2636
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:08,923
THEY ARE NOT ALONE IN  DOING 

2637
01:22:08,923 --> 01:22:09,724
THIS.  

2638
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:14,029
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SIMILAR 

2639
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:16,164
GROUPS WHO PERFORM THIS  

2640
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:16,998
SERVICE.  

2641
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:22,537
AND IT CAUSES ME TO THINK THAT 

2642
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:23,772
SOMETIMES THE TRUE PARTY IN 

2643
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:27,642
INTEREST IS ACTUALLY NOT THE 

2644
01:22:27,642 --> 01:22:34,282
NAMED PARTY BEFORE THE COURT,  

2645
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:36,351
BUT RATHER THE LEGAL GROUP THAT 

2646
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:38,319
HAS HIRED THE CLIENT AND 

2647
01:22:38,319 --> 01:22:39,353
BROUGHT THEM TO THE COURT MORE 

2648
01:22:39,353 --> 01:22:40,955
OR LESS AS A PROBLEM IN ORDER 

2649
01:22:40,955 --> 01:22:43,024
TO MAKE ARGUMENTS TRYING TO 

2650
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:44,125
DIRECT THE COURT IN A 

2651
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:45,360
PARTICULAR DIRECTION.  

2652
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,795
IS THAT AN UNREASONABLE CONCERN 

2653
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:50,498
FOR US TO HAVE ABOUT THE 

2654
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:50,999
PROCESS? 

2655
01:22:50,999 --> 01:22:53,101
>> SENATOR,  I THINK THERE ARE 

2656
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:55,770
PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION 

2657
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:57,072
GROUPS SPANNING THE IDEOLOGICAL 

2658
01:22:57,072 --> 01:23:02,377
SPECTRUM THAT LOOK FOR CASES TO 

2659
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:06,514
WEIGH IN ON IN THE MICUS BRIEFS 

2660
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:07,749
AND THERE HAVE BEEN 

2661
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:10,952
HISTORICALLY,  YOU LOOK FOR,  

2662
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:11,953
AS I UNDERSTAND IT,  PREMIUM 

2663
01:23:11,953 --> 01:23:12,787
TRYING TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE 

2664
01:23:12,787 --> 01:23:14,522
PLAINTIFFS TO CHALLENGE,  AND 

2665
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:19,928
THIS AGAIN IS ACROSS THE ENTIRE 

2666
01:23:19,928 --> 01:23:20,361
IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM.  

2667
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:56,331
>> VERY POWERFUL INTERESS CAN 

2668
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:59,601
COME BEHIND AN AM I CUSS GROUP 

2669
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:01,836
AND NOBODY KNOWS WHO -- AMICUS 

2670
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:04,973
GROUP AND NOBODY REALLY KNOWS 

2671
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:10,144
WHO IS OF INTEREST. 

2672
01:24:10,144 --> 01:24:12,881
ANOTHER THING THAT IS OF 

2673
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:16,417
CONCERN IS WHEN YOU SEE THESE 

2674
01:24:16,417 --> 01:24:17,952
SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS RUSHING 

2675
01:24:17,952 --> 01:24:20,021
OUT TO LOSE  CASES IN FORD GET 

2676
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:21,856
IN FRONT OF A FRIENDLY COURT.  

2677
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:23,591
IT WOULD SEEM OF INTEREST FOR 

2678
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:25,226
SOMEBODY THATS THAT TRIED 

2679
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:26,494
CASES,  BEEN AROUND COURTROOMS 

2680
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:30,064
A LOT,  SEEN A LOT OF GREAT 

2681
01:24:30,064 --> 01:24:31,099
LITIGATIONS AND LITIGATOR,  I 

2682
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:32,433
HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY ONCE 

2683
01:24:32,433 --> 01:24:35,670
TRY TO LOSE A LEGITIMATE CASE.  

2684
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:42,777
IN THE WAKE OF JUSTICE  ALEE 

2685
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:44,512
TOE'S SIGNALING OF WHAT WAS 

2686
01:24:44,512 --> 01:24:46,514
THEN FREDERICK AND JANICE AND 

2687
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:50,151
RUSH OUT AND ASK THE COURT TO 

2688
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:51,686
RULE AGAINST THEM TO GET HOT 

2689
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:54,455
FOOT SO THEY CAN EXPECT A GOOD 

2690
01:24:54,455 --> 01:24:55,456
OUTCOME,  TO ME THAT DOESN'T 

2691
01:24:55,456 --> 01:24:55,790
SEEM RIGHT.  

2692
01:25:04,465 --> 01:25:05,867
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS 

2693
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:07,802
SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON,  

2694
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:09,604
HAVING REAL PARTIES AND REAL 

2695
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:12,040
ARGUMENTS AND THE SUPREME COURT 

2696
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:12,640
PROPERLY PREPARED REAL 

2697
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:12,973
DISPUTES.  

2698
01:25:12,973 --> 01:25:16,244
DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERN ABOUT 

2699
01:25:16,244 --> 01:25:18,079
THE OPTICS OF PEOPLE RUSHING TO 

2700
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:19,681
LOSE CASES BELOW TO COME BEFORE 

2701
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:21,982
WHAT THEY THINK IS A FRIENDLY 

2702
01:25:21,982 --> 01:25:22,517

2861

2865
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:13,708
DON'T THINK IT HAS DONE BECAUSE

SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE COME OUT 

2867
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:16,444

COMPOSED OF. 

3060
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:33,220
>> WOULD IT BEHOOVE A LAWYER 

3061
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:37,258
WHO IS AN OVER OF THE COURT TO 

3062
01:36:37,258 --> 01:36:39,293
CALL INTO QUESTION THE 

3063
01:36:39,293 --> 01:36:40,160
SUBJECTIVE MOTIVATIONS OF A 

3064
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:42,062
COURT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE 

3065
01:36:42,062 --> 01:36:45,666
FACT THAT THIS COURT DECIDED A 

3066
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:47,534
CASE ON A 5-4 BASIS? 

3067
01:36:47,534 --> 01:36:49,136
>> WELL,  IF I WERE A LAWYER 

3068
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:50,804
ARGUING BEFORE THE SUPREME 

3069
01:36:50,804 --> 01:36:54,074
COURT I PROBABLY WOULD REFRAIN 

3070
01:36:54,074 --> 01:36:55,509
FROM QUESTIONS THE MOTIVATIONS 

3071
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:56,443
OF THE JUSTICE.  

3072
01:36:56,443 --> 01:36:59,746
I THINK EACH OF THE JUSTICES,  

3073
01:36:59,746 --> 01:37:03,217
I KNOW THEM,  THEY ARE ALL 

3074
01:37:03,217 --> 01:37:04,952
COMMITTED  TO THE CONSTITUTION 

3075
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:07,621
OF THE UNITED STATES,  

3076
01:37:07,621 --> 01:37:08,455
IMPARTIALLY DISCHARGING THEIR 

3077
01:37:08,455 --> 01:37:09,590
DUTIES,  OF COURSE HAVE 

3078
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:10,724
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON 

3079
01:37:10,724 --> 01:37:13,160
CERTAIN ISSUES,  BUT THEY ARE 

3080
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:16,030
ALL,  I THINK WE ARE FORTUNATE 

3081
01:37:16,030 --> 01:37:19,400
TO HAVE A HARD WORKING JUSTICES 

3082
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:20,134
WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING  RECORDS,  

3083
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:21,134
COMMITTED  TO THE CONSTITUTION 

3084
01:37:21,134 --> 01:37:22,870
AND COMMITTED  TO THE 

3085
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:24,805
INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. 

3086
01:37:24,805 --> 01:37:26,674
>> WHAT ABOUT IN THE CIRCUIT 

3087
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:29,009
COURT,  IN THE D.C. CIRCUIT 

3088
01:37:29,009 --> 01:37:30,043
WHERE YOU HAVE SERVED? 

3089
01:37:30,043 --> 01:37:33,681
WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SUGGEST 

3090
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,749
THAT A CASE IS SOMEHOW LESS 

3091
01:37:35,749 --> 01:37:37,584
LEGITIMATELY DECIDED IF THAT 

3092
01:37:37,584 --> 01:37:41,555
CASE WERE DECIDED  ALONG THE 

3093
01:37:41,555 --> 01:37:43,524
LINES OF THE PRESIDENT THAT 

3094
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:47,895
APPOINTED WHICH MEMBER OF THE 

3095
01:37:47,895 --> 01:37:48,661
D.C. CIRCUIT? 

3096
01:37:48,661 --> 01:37:52,365
>> THE PRECEDENT STANDS EITHER 

3097
01:37:52,365 --> 01:37:53,801
EITHER WAY.  

3098
01:37:53,801 --> 01:37:54,201
THANK YO 

3099
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:56,437
>> I WANT TO GET BACK TO A

01:37:56,437 --> 01:37:59,273
SEPARATION OF POWERS POINT THAT 

3101
01:37:59,273 --> 01:38:01,542
HAS COME UP  ALONG VARIOUS 

3102
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:05,512
LINES OF QUESTIONS ASKED BY MY 

3103
01:38:05,512 --> 01:38:06,546
COLLEAGUES TODAY.  

3104
01:38:06,546 --> 01:38:09,116
IS THE CONSTITUTION RELEGATED  

3105
01:38:09,116 --> 01:38:10,050
TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH? 

3106
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:12,286
IS IT SOMETHING THAT IS TO BE 

3107
01:38:12,286 --> 01:38:13,854
UPHELD AND INTERPRETED ONLY BY 

3108
01:38:13,854 --> 01:38:16,590
THOSE THAT WEAR BLACK ROBES? 

3109
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:17,925
>> NO,  SENATOR.  

3110
01:38:17,925 --> 01:38:19,259
LET ME TAKE YOU THROUGH THE 

3111
01:38:19,259 --> 01:38:20,293
PROCESS,  I THINK.  

3112
01:38:20,293 --> 01:38:23,530
CONGRESS,  OF COURSE,  PASSES 

3113
01:38:23,530 --> 01:38:26,299
LAWS AND IN CONSIDERING LAWS,  

3114
01:38:26,299 --> 01:38:28,434
CONGRESS WILL ALSO OFTEN ASSESS 

3115
01:38:28,434 --> 01:38:29,570
THE POSSIBLE CONSTITUTIONALITY 

3116
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:32,006
OF THE LAWS PASSED.  

3117
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:33,374
SO IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WHEN 

3118
01:38:33,374 --> 01:38:35,275
YOU ARE CONSIDERING THE PACKAGE 

3119
01:38:35,275 --> 01:38:38,545
OF A LAW,  YOU MIGHT ASSESS THE

FIRST AMENDMENT IMPLICATIONS OR 

3121
01:38:40,346 --> 01:38:44,084
IF IT IS A NATIONAL SECURITY,

01:38:44,084 --> 01:38:45,719
THE FOURTH AMENDMENT 

3123
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:47,855

AND/OR THE DUE PROCESS FIFTH

3126
01:38:50,857 --> 01:38:53,360
>> AND WE HAVE ALL TAKEN OUR 

3127
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:54,428
OWN OATH TO UPHOLD THE 

3128
01:38:54,428 --> 01:38:54,761
CONSTITUTION. 

3129
01:38:54,761 --> 01:38:56,864
>> YOU DO YOUR BEST,  THE 

3130
01:38:56,864 --> 01:38:58,198
EXECUTIVE BRANCH,  THE 

3131
01:38:58,198 --> 01:38:59,032
CONSTITUTION WHETHER TO SIGN 

3132
01:38:59,032 --> 01:39:00,300
THE BILL,  FOR EXAMPLE,  FOR 

3133
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:00,968
THE PRESIDENT.  

3134
01:39:00,968 --> 01:39:01,802
THE PRESIDENT HAS A 

3135
01:39:01,802 --> 01:39:03,837
CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN,  OR A 

3136
01:39:03,837 --> 01:39:04,972
POLICY CONCERN,  BUT THE 

3137
01:39:04,972 --> 01:39:05,973
PRESIDENT COULD VETO THE BILL 

3138
01:39:05,973 --> 01:39:07,541
FOR THAT REASON.  

3139
01:39:07,541 --> 01:39:08,676
THAT HAS CERTAINLY HAPPENED 

3140
01:39:08,676 --> 01:39:09,043
HISTORICALLY.  

3141
01:39:09,043 --> 01:39:11,144
AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:39:11,144 --> 01:39:16,884
COURT,  OF COURSE,  WE ARE --

01:39:18,218 --> 01:39:19,119
CONTROVERSY,  THE 

3145
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:20,454
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF A LAW THAT

01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:22,523
IS CHALLENGED THERE IN THE

01:39:22,523 --> 01:39:25,359
CONTEXT OF A SPECIFIC CASE OR

PRESIDENT WASHINGTON,  GEORGE

WASHINGTON,  ASKED THE SUPREME 

3151

LEGAL ISSUE.  

3154
01:39:36,003 --> 01:39:39,640

THERE BY UNDERSCORING THE POINT 

3163
01:39:53,987 --> 01:39:55,923
YOU ARE MAKING WITH YOUR 

3164
01:39:55,923 --> 01:39:56,757
QUESTION WHICH IS 

3165
01:39:56,757 --> 01:39:59,092
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF  LAWS 

3166
01:39:59,092 --> 01:39:59,392

AND EXECUTIVE. 

3170
01:40:09,336 --> 01:40:10,003
>> IT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE 

3171
01:40:10,003 --> 01:40:11,972
FOR US AS MEMBERS OF THE 

3172
01:40:11,972 --> 01:40:13,507
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH TO DECIDE TO 

3173
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:14,942
PROTECT SOMETHING WE BELIEVE IS 

3174
01:40:14,942 --> 01:40:17,077
CONSTITUTIONALLY  PROTECTED 

3175
01:40:17,077 --> 01:40:18,512
REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE MIGHT 

3176
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:20,180
PLACE OUR BETS ON WHAT THE 

3177
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:21,548
COURTS WOULD DO WITH IT.  

3178
01:40:21,548 --> 01:40:23,316
IF WE SEE A PARTICULAR RIGHT 

3179
01:40:23,316 --> 01:40:25,252
THAT MAY BE JEOPARDIZED BY AN 

3180
01:40:25,252 --> 01:40:26,186
ACT OF CONGRESS WE ARE 

3181
01:40:26,186 --> 01:40:28,122
CONSIDERING,  IT WOULD NOT BE 

3182
01:40:28,122 --> 01:40:29,556
INAPPROPRIATE FOR US TO SAY 

3183
01:40:29,556 --> 01:40:32,092
LOOK,  WE ARE NOT SURE EXACTLY 

3184
01:40:32,092 --> 01:40:33,727
HOW FAR THE SUPREME COURT WOULD 

3185
01:40:33,727 --> 01:40:34,862
GO HERE.  

3186
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:36,630
OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF 

3187
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:37,931
PRECAUTION WE WILL DRAW THE 

3188
01:40:37,931 --> 01:40:39,867
LINE MORE CAREFULLY TO MAKE 

3189
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:42,769
SURE WE DON'T STEP INTO 

3190
01:40:42,769 --> 01:40:43,970
UNCONSTITUTIONAL TERRITORY? 

3191
01:40:43,970 --> 01:40:45,605
>> THAT HAPPENS HISTORICALLY 

3192
01:40:45,605 --> 01:40:47,607
AND HAPPENS TODAY.  

3193
01:40:47,607 --> 01:40:49,877
THAT UNDERSCORES HOW THE 

3194
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:50,611
CONSTITUTION TILTS TOWARD 

3195
01:40:50,611 --> 01:40:51,745
LIBERTY IN SO MANY DIFFERENT 

3196
01:40:51,745 --> 01:40:52,846
WAYS.  

3197
01:40:52,846 --> 01:40:53,947
IT TILTS TOWARD LIBERTY BECAUSE 

3198
01:40:53,947 --> 01:40:55,883
IT IS HARD TO PASS THE LAW,  AS 

3199
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:57,417
YOU KNOW,  WITH BOTH HOUSES AND 

3200
01:40:57,417 --> 01:40:58,752
THE PRESIDENT.  

3201
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:01,455
THEN NOT ONLY MIGHT WILL BE 

3202
01:41:01,455 --> 01:41:03,890
POLICY OBJECTIONS,  BUT MEMBERS 

3203
01:41:03,890 --> 01:41:05,392
OF CONGRESS MAY SAY WELL EVEN 

3204
01:41:05,392 --> 01:41:06,860
IF THE SUPREME COURT WOULD 

3205
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:08,027
UPHOLD THIS LAW BASED ON MY 

3206
01:41:08,027 --> 01:41:09,396
ASSESSMENT OF THE SUPREME 

3207
01:41:09,396 --> 01:41:12,098
COURT,  I HAVE A FIRST 

3208
01:41:12,098 --> 01:41:14,701
AMENDMENT OBJECTION,  FOURTH 

3209
01:41:14,701 --> 01:41:16,236
AMENDMENT OBJECTION,  EIGHTH 

3210
01:41:16,236 --> 01:41:18,972
AMENDMENT CRUEL AND UNUSUAL 

3211
01:41:18,972 --> 01:41:20,239
PUNISHMENTS CLAUSE OBJECTION 

3212
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:21,742
AND BASED ON MY VIEW OF THE 

3213
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:23,076
OBJECTION I WILL VOTE NO ON 

3214
01:41:23,076 --> 01:41:23,677
THIS LAW.  

3215
01:41:23,677 --> 01:41:26,547
THAT IS ANOTHER WAY THE 

3216
01:41:26,547 --> 01:41:28,015
CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE ALL 

3217
01:41:28,015 --> 01:41:29,850
FITS TOGETHER AND TILTS TOWARD 

3218
01:41:29,850 --> 01:41:30,117
LIBERTY. 

3219
01:41:30,117 --> 01:41:32,019
>> FOR THAT VERY REASON IT 

3220
01:41:32,019 --> 01:41:32,953
WOULD PROBABLY LEAD TO BAD 

3221
01:41:32,953 --> 01:41:34,588
RESULTS IF FEE WERE NOT TO DO 

3222
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:35,189
THAT.  

3223
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:37,524
IF WE WERE ALWAYS INCLINED  TO 

3224
01:41:37,524 --> 01:41:39,493
SAY LET'S JUST PASS THIS IF IT 

3225
01:41:39,493 --> 01:41:40,928
IS COUNTRY CONSTITUTIONAL,  THE 

3226
01:41:40,928 --> 01:41:42,229
COURT WOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT 

3227
01:41:42,229 --> 01:41:42,763
IT.  

3228
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:44,398
DO YOU SEE INSTANCES WHERE THAT 

3229
01:41:44,398 --> 01:41:45,098
COULD CREATE PROBLEM 

3230
01:41:45,098 --> 01:41:47,267
>> YES,  SENATOR.  

3231
01:41:47,267 --> 01:41:49,403
I THINK JUSTICE KENNEDY HAS 

3232
01:41:49,403 --> 01:41:50,704
WRITTEN ELOQUENTLY ABOUT THIS.  

3233
01:41:50,704 --> 01:41:51,939
EACH OFFICIAL,  EACH MEMBER OF 

3234
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,774
CONGRESS,  EACH SENATOR,  THE 

3235
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:55,209
PRESIDENT,  TAKES AN OATH,  OF 

3236
01:41:55,209 --> 01:41:59,513
COURSE,  A  CONSTITUTIONAL OATH 

3237
01:41:59,513 --> 01:42:01,982
TO  ABIDE BY THE CONSTITUTION.  

3238
01:42:01,982 --> 01:42:04,751
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR EACH 

3239
01:42:04,751 --> 01:42:05,652
MEMBER TO UNDERSTAND AND 

3240
01:42:05,652 --> 01:42:07,521
UNDERSCORE,  AS I KNOW ALL OF 

3241
01:42:07,521 --> 01:42:08,222
YOU DO.  

3242
01:42:08,222 --> 01:42:13,227
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF 

3243
01:42:13,227 --> 01:42:14,628
THECEPS OF POWERS PROCESS.-- OF 

3244
01:42:14,628 --> 01:42:15,562
THE SEPARATION OF POWERS 

3245
01:42:15,562 --> 01:42:16,697
PROCESS.  

3246
01:42:16,697 --> 01:42:18,232
I DON'T THINK THE FRAMERS

3247
01:42:18,232 --> 01:42:19,333
THOUGHT LET'S PASS SOMETHING 

3248
01:42:19,333 --> 01:42:21,101
EVEN THOUGH WE  OURSELVES,  

3249
01:42:21,101 --> 01:42:21,935
MEANING THE MEMBERS OF 

3250
01:42:21,935 --> 01:42:23,203
CONGRESS,  THINK THERE IS A 

3251
01:42:23,203 --> 01:42:24,571
CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM HERE.  

3252
01:42:24,571 --> 01:42:26,406
THAT IS NOW HOW IT HAS WORKED  

3253
01:42:26,406 --> 01:42:28,275
HISTORICALLY,  NOR DO I THINK 

3254
01:42:28,275 --> 01:42:29,609
THAT IS HOW THE FRAMERS 

3255
01:42:29,609 --> 01:42:33,313
NECESSARILY INTENDED FOR 

3256
01:42:33,313 --> 01:42:33,746
CONGRESS TO WORK. 

3257
01:42:33,746 --> 01:42:36,250
>> THERE ARE MYRIAD INSTANCES 

3258
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:38,485
MORE OVER WE MIGHT ENACT 

3259
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:40,020
SOMETHING THAT FOR ONE REASON 

3260
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:42,088
OR ANOTHER MIGHT NOT BE 

3261
01:42:42,088 --> 01:42:43,957
CHALLENGED FOR A ALONG TIME,  

3262
01:42:43,957 --> 01:42:46,727
OR JUDICIAL  ISSUE,  SOMEBODY 

3263
01:42:46,727 --> 01:42:48,161
LACKING UNDERSTANDING,  AND SO 

3264
01:42:48,161 --> 01:42:48,394
FORTH. 

3265
01:42:48,394 --> 01:42:49,396
>> THAT PARTICULARLY HAPPENS IN 

3266
01:42:49,396 --> 01:42:50,330
THE NATIONAL SECURITY CONTEXT,  

3267
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:52,566
I THINK,  SENATOR,  BECAUSE 

3268
01:42:52,566 --> 01:42:55,035
THERE IS OFTEN SOMEONE NOT  

3269
01:42:55,035 --> 01:42:56,470
WITHSTANDING,  ESPECIALLY IF 

3270
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:58,071
SOMETHING IS BEING DONE IN A 

3271
01:42:58,071 --> 01:42:59,206
FOREIGN COUNTRY AGAINST FOREIGN 

3272
01:42:59,206 --> 01:43:00,540
CITIZENS THAT MAY BE DIFFICULT 

3273
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:01,975
TO GET INTO COURT IN SOME WAY 

3274
01:43:01,975 --> 01:43:02,308
OR ANOTHER. 

3275
01:43:02,308 --> 01:43:03,810
>> ONE OF THE REASONS I FOCUS 

3276
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:06,946
ON THIS TODAY IS THERE IS AN 

3277
01:43:06,946 --> 01:43:09,683
EXCHANGE YOU HAD WITH ONE OF MY 

3278
01:43:09,683 --> 01:43:11,118
COLLEAGUES EARLIER TODAY ABOUT 

3279
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:12,986
THE INDEFINITE DETENTION OF 

3280
01:43:12,986 --> 01:43:13,954
AMERICAN CITIZENS APPREHENDED 

3281
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:15,222
ON U.S. SOIL.  

3282
01:43:15,222 --> 01:43:17,691
THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS 

3283
01:43:17,691 --> 01:43:19,092
SURROUNDING THIS,  SUGGESTING 

3284
01:43:19,092 --> 01:43:21,461
THAT THE EX PARTE JUSTIFY THIS. 

3285
01:43:21,461 --> 01:43:22,696
YOU DON'T NEED TO RESPOND TO 

3286
01:43:22,696 --> 01:43:25,332
THIS,  BUT I THINK IT IS A 

3287
01:43:25,332 --> 01:43:27,100
POINT THAT NEEDS TO BE 

3288
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:29,703
MENTIONED.  

3289
01:43:29,703 --> 01:43:32,639
JUSTICE SCALIA MENTIONED IN HIS 

3290
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:36,143
DECENT THAT EX PARTE CURRIN WAS 

3291
01:43:36,143 --> 01:43:37,778
NOT THIS COURT'S FINEST  HOUR.  

3292
01:43:37,778 --> 01:43:40,981
IN FACT,  WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE 

3293
01:43:40,981 --> 01:43:44,351
CASE WAS ARGUED,  IT WITH US 

3294
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:46,286
DECIDED THE NEXT DAY,  THE 

3295
01:43:46,286 --> 01:43:49,189
SENATORS WERE TAKEN OUT AND 

3296
01:43:49,189 --> 01:43:50,390
EXECUTED THE NEXT WEEK,  THEN 

3297
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:51,758
THE OPINION ITSELF WAS  ISSUED 

3298
01:43:51,758 --> 01:43:52,659
MANY MONTHS  LATER.  

3299
01:43:52,659 --> 01:43:55,929
SO,  AGAIN,  I AM NOT ASKING 

3300
01:43:55,929 --> 01:44:00,500
YOU TO PINE ON THE ON GOING 

3301
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:01,535
VALIDITY OF EXPARTY CURRIN,  

3302
01:44:01,535 --> 01:44:04,504
BUT THE POINT IS YOU CERTAINLY 

3303
01:44:04,504 --> 01:44:05,806
AGREE THAT CONGRESS HAS THE 

3304
01:44:05,806 --> 01:44:07,073
AUTHORITY TO PROTECT LIBERTY,  

3305
01:44:07,073 --> 01:44:09,008
NOT  WITHSTANDING THE 

3306
01:44:09,008 --> 01:44:11,878
POSSIBILITY THAT THE SUPREME 

3307
01:44:11,878 --> 01:44:16,516
COURT MIGHT NOT STEP IN IN THE 

3308
01:44:16,516 --> 01:44:17,217
EX PARTE CASE? 

3309
01:44:17,217 --> 01:44:18,985
>> A COUPLE POINTS.  

3310
01:44:18,985 --> 01:44:21,754
JUSTICE CAN A LEAH,  OF COURSE 

3311
01:44:21,754 --> 01:44:23,490
-- SCALIA,  OF COURSE,  

3312
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:26,660
DECENTED IN THAT CASE,  ALONG 

3313
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:30,130
WITH JUSTICE STEPHENS,  ONE OF 

3314
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:31,965
HIS MORE POWERFUL DECENTS ON 

3315
01:44:31,965 --> 01:44:33,099
INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY. 

3316
01:44:33,099 --> 01:44:33,500
[ HECKLER ] 

3317
01:44:56,956 --> 01:44:59,226
THEY ARE RULING IT WAS AN 

3318
01:44:59,226 --> 01:45:01,461
IMPORTANT OPINION OF JUSTICE 

3319
01:45:01,461 --> 01:45:02,929
SCALIA'S,  ONE OF HIS MOST 

3320
01:45:02,929 --> 01:45:04,831
IMPORTANT OPINIONS AND A VERY 

3321
01:45:04,831 --> 01:45:05,565
POWERFUL OPINION.  

3322
01:45:05,565 --> 01:45:08,435
ON THE OPINION ITSELF,  IT 

3323
01:45:08,435 --> 01:45:10,370
DEALT WITH SOME,  MANY WHO WERE 

3324
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:12,272
NOT AMERICAN CITIZENS,  BUT YOU 

3325
01:45:12,272 --> 01:45:14,774
ARE RIGHT,  THERE ARE AMERICAN  

3326
01:45:14,774 --> 01:45:16,810
THE COURT,  YOU ARE RIGHT,  

3327
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:19,179
ALSO,  OF COURSE,  YOU STUDIED 

3328
01:45:19,179 --> 01:45:21,014
THIS AS MUCH AS ANYONE,  BUT 

3329
01:45:21,014 --> 01:45:25,285
THE COURT DID RESOLVE THE CASE 

3330
01:45:25,285 --> 01:45:27,587
VERY QUICKLY AND I SPENT MANY 

3331
01:45:27,587 --> 01:45:29,589
AN HOUR TRYING TO DECIPHER 

3332
01:45:29,589 --> 01:45:30,323
CERTAIN PARAGRAPHS OF THAT 

3333
01:45:30,323 --> 01:45:32,058
OPINION FOR CASES I HAVE HAD.  

3334
01:45:32,058 --> 01:45:33,593
IT IS NOT EASY.  

3335
01:45:33,593 --> 01:45:36,463
I WILL SAY THE COURT,  TO ITS 

3336
01:45:36,463 --> 01:45:38,098
CREDIT,  GET A LITTLE CREDIT,  

3337
01:45:38,098 --> 01:45:40,767
DID HAVE AN EIGHT OUR OR 

3338
01:45:40,767 --> 01:45:41,668
SOMETHING ORAL ARGUMENT WITH 

3339
01:45:41,668 --> 01:45:43,303
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE 

3340
01:45:43,303 --> 01:45:44,504
UNITED STATES ARGUING 

3341
01:45:44,504 --> 01:45:45,439
PERSONALLY.  

3342
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:47,407
I READ THE TRANSCRIPT OF THAT 

3343
01:45:47,407 --> 01:45:49,042
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS 

3344
01:45:49,042 --> 01:45:52,112
GOING ON THE OPINION THAT DID 

3345
01:45:52,112 --> 01:45:53,913
NOT UNLOCK THE BOX COMPLETELY 

3346
01:45:53,913 --> 01:45:56,516
FOR ME,  BUT YOUR POINT,  

3347
01:45:56,516 --> 01:45:58,452
JUSTICE SCALIA DID SAY IT WAS 

3348
01:45:58,452 --> 01:45:59,619
NOT THE COURT'S FINEST HOUR.  

3349
01:45:59,619 --> 01:46:01,221
IT WITH US A  RUSH.  

3350
01:46:01,221 --> 01:46:03,390
AND RUSH,  SOMETIMES THE COURT 

3351
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:05,525
HAS TO RUSH,  BUT RUSH 

3352
01:46:05,525 --> 01:46:08,795
DECISIONS IN A JUDICIAL CONTEXT 

3353
01:46:08,795 --> 01:46:09,729
SOMETIMES AREN'T ALWAYS THE 

3354
01:46:09,729 --> 01:46:09,929
BEST. 

3355
01:46:09,929 --> 01:46:11,765
>> ON THAT POINT,  WOULD YOU BE 

3356
01:46:11,765 --> 01:46:14,334
OPEN TO THE IDEA OF BRINGING 

3357
01:46:14,334 --> 01:46:18,705
BACK THE ERA OF THE HOUR ORAL 

3358
01:46:18,705 --> 01:46:23,242
-- EIGHTY-OUR ORAL  ARGUMENT? 

3359
01:46:23,242 --> 01:46:24,210
>> THE EIGHT-HOUR ORAL 

3360
01:46:24,210 --> 01:46:24,611
ARGUMENT? 

3361
01:46:24,611 --> 01:46:28,014
WE DID HAVE ONE THAT WENT ALL 

3362
01:46:28,014 --> 01:46:28,815
AFTERNOON.  

3363
01:46:28,815 --> 01:46:31,518
AFTER WE GOT BACK TO THE 

3364
01:46:31,518 --> 01:46:32,919
CONFERENCE ROOM -- I DON'T 

3365
01:46:32,919 --> 01:46:34,254
THINK ANYONE WAS SAYING WE 

3366
01:46:34,254 --> 01:46:36,690
SHOULD DO THAT IN EVERY CASE. 

3367
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:38,425
>> UNDERSTOOD.  

3368
01:46:38,425 --> 01:46:38,892
LET'S TALK JUDICIAL  

3369
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:39,659
PHILOSOPHY.  

3370
01:46:39,659 --> 01:46:41,895
I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS FEDERAL 

3371
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:42,128
78.  

3372
01:46:42,128 --> 01:46:44,765
IN FEDERAL 78,  HAMILTON 

3373
01:46:44,765 --> 01:46:45,298
DISCUSSES  THE DICHOTOMY 

3374
01:46:45,298 --> 01:46:46,933
BETWEEN WILL ON THE ONE HAND 

3375
01:46:46,933 --> 01:46:49,102
AND JUDGMENT ON THE OTHER.  

3376
01:46:49,102 --> 01:46:51,304
WILL BEING SOMETHING THAT IS 

3377
01:46:51,304 --> 01:46:52,838
EXERCISED BY THE POLITICAL 

3378
01:46:52,838 --> 01:46:55,108
BRANCHES,  PRIMARILY BY THE 

3379
01:46:55,108 --> 01:46:58,178
CONGRESSES,  THE LEGISLATIVE ÃºB 

3380
01:46:58,178 --> 01:47:00,446
SOMETHING BE EXERCISED BY THE 

3381
01:47:00,446 --> 01:47:02,082
JUDICIAL BRAN.  

3382
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:03,617
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE --  

3383
01:47:03,617 --> 01:47:04,017
BRANCH.  

3384
01:47:04,017 --> 01:47:06,052
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 

3385
01:47:06,052 --> 01:47:06,686
THE TWO? 

3386
01:47:06,686 --> 01:47:08,288
>> THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS 

3387
01:47:08,288 --> 01:47:08,788
DECIDING CASES AND 

3388
01:47:08,788 --> 01:47:10,457
CONTROVERSIES ACCORDING TO LAW. 

3389
01:47:10,457 --> 01:47:12,058
THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH IS 

3390
01:47:12,058 --> 01:47:14,794
MAKING THE POLICY,  EXERCISING 

3391
01:47:14,794 --> 01:47:18,298
THE WILL.  

3392
01:47:18,298 --> 01:47:20,333
THE JUDICIAL BRANCH CAN NEVER 

3393
01:47:20,333 --> 01:47:21,668
EXERCISE THE  POLICY-MAKING 

3394
01:47:21,668 --> 01:47:23,036
ROLE THAT IS RESERVED TO THE 

3395
01:47:23,036 --> 01:47:23,904
CONGRESS.  

3396
01:47:23,904 --> 01:47:25,237
ADMITTEDLY THAT IS SPEAKING TO 

3397
01:47:25,237 --> 01:47:28,608
THE LEVEL OF GENERALITY AND 

3398
01:47:28,608 --> 01:47:31,478
THERE ARE TOUGH CASES IN THE 

3399
01:47:31,478 --> 01:47:31,878
MARGINS.  

3400
01:47:31,878 --> 01:47:32,845
I AM ALWAYS TRYING TO FIGURE 

3401
01:47:32,845 --> 01:47:34,781
OUT WHAT THE LINE IS.  

3402
01:47:34,781 --> 01:47:36,249
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR EVERY 

3403
01:47:36,249 --> 01:47:38,051
JUDGE TO GO IN WITH THE MINESET 

3404
01:47:38,051 --> 01:47:41,354
I AM NOT THE POLICY-MAKER,  AND 

3405
01:47:41,354 --> 01:47:44,223
I AM THE LAW INTERPRETER,  LAW 

3406
01:47:44,223 --> 01:47:45,425
APPLY IN EVERY CASE.  

3407
01:47:45,425 --> 01:47:48,194
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF 

3408
01:47:48,194 --> 01:47:49,463
THE FEDERALIST PAPERS WON INTO 

3409
01:47:49,463 --> 01:47:51,464
THE CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF 

3410
01:47:51,464 --> 01:47:53,733
ARTICLE 3,  THAT JUDGES I 

3411
01:47:53,733 --> 01:47:54,467
CERTAINLY HAVE TRIED FOR 12 

3412
01:47:54,467 --> 01:47:57,404
YEARS AS A JUDGE ON THE D.C. 

3413
01:47:57,404 --> 01:47:59,773
CIRCUIT,  TO INCORPORATE THAT 

3414
01:47:59,773 --> 01:48:00,974
BASIC FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE TO 

3415
01:48:00,974 --> 01:48:02,943
HOW I APPROACH EACH CASE.  

3416
01:48:02,943 --> 01:48:05,478
IT IS A VERY CRITICAL  BED-ROCK 

3417
01:48:05,478 --> 01:48:08,014
PRINCIPLE OF WHAT JUDGES DO IN 

3418
01:48:08,014 --> 01:48:09,416
OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTE 

3419
01:48:09,416 --> 01:48:12,085
>> WITHIN THAT  FRAMEWORK,  

3420
01:48:12,085 --> 01:48:14,220
WHEN WE  ENACT A LAW,  WHAT 

3421
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:16,656
DETERMINES WHAT IT IS THAT YOU 

3422
01:48:16,656 --> 01:48:18,491
HAVE TO INTERPRET IT? 

3423
01:48:18,491 --> 01:48:20,860
IS IT WHAT WE SAY? 

3424
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:23,362
OR IS IT WHAT WE SUBJECTIVELY 

3425
01:48:23,362 --> 01:48:23,629
INTENDED? 

3426
01:48:23,629 --> 01:48:28,535
>> IT IS WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE 

3427
01:48:28,535 --> 01:48:31,838
TEXT AND THE STATUTE,  SENATOR. 

3428
01:48:31,838 --> 01:48:34,207
JUSTICE KAY BEGAN SAID IT WELL 

3429
01:48:34,207 --> 01:48:37,377
IN A TALK TWO YEARS AGO,  MAYBE 

3430
01:48:37,377 --> 01:48:40,480
THREE,  I WAS IN THE AUDIENCE.  

3431
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,682
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT JUSTICE 

3432
01:48:42,682 --> 01:48:47,087
SCALIA,  BEES WHO OF COURSE 

3433
01:48:47,087 --> 01:48:54,127
BROUGHT ABOUT SIGNIFICANT -- SHE

3434
01:48:54,127 --> 01:48:54,861
CHANGE.  

3435
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:56,062
ALL FEDERAL JUDGES PAY CLOSE 

3436
01:48:56,062 --> 01:48:57,931
ATTENTION TO THE TEXT OF THE 

3437
01:48:57,931 --> 01:48:58,331
STATUTE.  

3438
01:48:58,331 --> 01:49:01,033
THAT IS WHY SHE SAID WE ARE ALL 

3439
01:49:01,033 --> 01:49:03,903
TEXAS WALL NOW.  

3440
01:49:03,903 --> 01:49:05,038
KAGAN EXPLAINED EVERYBODY  

3441
01:49:05,038 --> 01:49:06,473
CARES ABOUT THE WORDS PASSED BY 

3442
01:49:06,473 --> 01:49:06,773
CONGRESS.  

3443
01:49:06,773 --> 01:49:09,209
I THINK ABOUT IT FROM A FORMAL 

3444
01:49:09,209 --> 01:49:10,910
AND FUNCTIONALIST PERSPECTIVE.  

3445
01:49:10,910 --> 01:49:12,545
AS A FORMAL MATTER THE LAW 

3446
01:49:12,545 --> 01:49:15,415
PASSED BY CONGRESS IS THE 

3447
01:49:15,415 --> 01:49:16,549
BINDING LAW AS IS WHAT IS 

3448
01:49:16,549 --> 01:49:18,118
SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT,  IT IS 

3449
01:49:18,118 --> 01:49:19,119
WHAT IS GOING THROUGH THE 

3450
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:20,854
SENATE AND THE HOUSE.  

3451
01:49:20,854 --> 01:49:22,088
AND THAT IS THE LAW.  

3452
01:49:22,088 --> 01:49:25,959
BUT,  IT ALSO IS A PRACTICAL OR 

3453
01:49:25,959 --> 01:49:26,693
FUNCTIONAL MATTER.  

3454
01:49:26,693 --> 01:49:28,828
I THINK HAVING SEEN THE 

3455
01:49:28,828 --> 01:49:30,397
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS,  I KNOW 

3456
01:49:30,397 --> 01:49:31,331
HOW COMPROMISES COME TOGETHER 

3457
01:49:31,331 --> 01:49:32,565
IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE,  

3458
01:49:32,565 --> 01:49:34,701
WITHIN THE SENATE AND HOUSE.  

3459
01:49:34,701 --> 01:49:36,769
THERE IS NEGOTIATIONS LATE AT 

3460
01:49:36,769 --> 01:49:40,507
NIGHT OVER PRECISE WORDS AND 

3461
01:49:40,507 --> 01:49:42,042
COMPROMISES INEVITABLY.  

3462
01:49:42,042 --> 01:49:44,077
THE LEGISLATION IS COMPROMISED, 

3463
01:49:44,077 --> 01:49:45,011
THE CONSTITUTION IS 

3464
01:49:45,011 --> 01:49:46,346
COMPROMISED,  LEGISLATION IS 

3465
01:49:46,346 --> 01:49:48,014
COMPROMISED,  AND WHEN WE 

3466
01:49:48,014 --> 01:49:49,148
DEPART FROM THE WORDS SPECIFIED 

3467
01:49:49,148 --> 01:49:52,552
IN THE TEXT OF THE STATUTE,  WE 

3468
01:49:52,552 --> 01:49:55,288
ARE POTENTIALLY UPSETTING THE 

3469
01:49:55,288 --> 01:49:56,823
COMPROMISE THAT YOU ALL 

3470
01:49:56,823 --> 01:49:58,158
CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED IN THE 

3471
01:49:58,158 --> 01:49:58,992
LEGISLATIVE NEGOTIATIONS YOU 

3472
01:49:58,992 --> 01:50:00,226
MAY HAVE HAD WITH EACH  OTHER.  

3473
01:50:00,226 --> 01:50:02,762
THAT IS A DANGER I TRY TO POINT 

3474
01:50:02,762 --> 01:50:04,831
OUT WHEN WE ARE HAVING EARLY 

3475
01:50:04,831 --> 01:50:06,866
ARGUMENT IN A CASE OR -- ORAL 

3476
01:50:06,866 --> 01:50:09,035
ARGUMENT IN A CASE OR 

3477
01:50:09,035 --> 01:50:11,037
EXPLAINING CASES WHEN WE 

3478
01:50:11,037 --> 01:50:13,873
DEVIATE FROM WHAT CONGRESS 

3479
01:50:13,873 --> 01:50:17,243
WROTE,  WE ARE COMPROMISING 

3480
01:50:17,243 --> 01:50:18,645
EVEN AS WE COMPROMISE AS 

3481
01:50:18,645 --> 01:50:20,413
JUDGES,  THAT IS NOT REALLY OUR 

3482
01:50:20,413 --> 01:50:20,679
ROLE.  

3483
01:50:20,679 --> 01:50:22,015
IT IS IMPORTANT AS A FUNCTIONAL 

3484
01:50:22,015 --> 01:50:24,751
MATTER TO STICK TO THE TEXT.  

3485
01:50:24,751 --> 01:50:29,122
THERE ARE  INTERPRETATIONS 

3486
01:50:29,122 --> 01:50:29,689
WHICH OCCASIONALLY CAUSE A 

3487
01:50:29,689 --> 01:50:31,458
PRESUMPTION AGAINST THE LIKE 

3488
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:33,126
THAT CAUSE YOU TO SUPER IMPOSE 

3489
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:35,562
A PRESUMPTION ON THE TEXT,  BUT 

3490
01:50:35,562 --> 01:50:36,596
OTHERWISE STICKING TO WHAT YOU 

3491
01:50:36,596 --> 01:50:39,032
PASS IS VERY IMPORTANT. 

3492
01:50:39,032 --> 01:50:41,101
>> YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A TEXT 

3493
01:50:41,101 --> 01:50:43,803
LIST,  AND IF YOU FOLLOW 

3494
01:50:43,803 --> 01:50:49,509
JUSTICE KAGAN'S STATEMENT,  WE 

3495
01:50:49,509 --> 01:50:50,743
ARE ALL TEXTUALISTS NOW. 

3496
01:50:50,743 --> 01:50:51,644
>> YES.  

3497
01:50:51,644 --> 01:50:54,547
PAYING ATTENTION TO THE TEXT OF 

3498
01:50:54,547 --> 01:50:58,952
THE STATUTE,  INFORMED BY THE 

3499
01:50:58,952 --> 01:51:01,087
CANNONS OF THE CONSTRUCTION,  

3500
01:51:01,087 --> 01:51:02,889
SUCH AS PRESUMPTIONS AGAINST 

3501
01:51:02,889 --> 01:51:04,758
REPLIED REPEALS,  THINGS LIKE 

3502
01:51:04,758 --> 01:51:07,026
THAT,  SOME OF THE CANNONS NOT 

3503
01:51:07,026 --> 01:51:08,962
JUST SETTLED WHICH IS A WHOLE 

3504
01:51:08,962 --> 01:51:09,462
SEPARATE HALF HOUR OF 

3505
01:51:09,462 --> 01:51:09,696
DISCUSSION.  

3506
01:51:38,691 --> 01:51:38,825
. 

3507
01:51:38,825 --> 01:51:41,828
>> JUSTICE KAGAN AT HER 

3508
01:51:41,828 --> 01:51:42,895
CONFIRMATION HEARING SAID WE 

3509
01:51:42,895 --> 01:51:45,932
ARE ALL ORE RIDGE INSTALLISTS 

3510
01:51:45,932 --> 01:51:47,767
NOW,  BY THAT SHE MEANT THE 

3511
01:51:47,767 --> 01:51:50,103
PRECISE TEXT OF THE 

3512
01:51:50,103 --> 01:51:52,105
CONSTITUTION MATTERS,  THE 

3513
01:51:52,105 --> 01:51:52,872
ORIGINAL MEETING,  PRECEDENT 

3514
01:51:52,872 --> 01:51:53,205
MATTERS,  AS WELL.  

3515
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:06,686
ORIGINAL INTENT,  WHAT DID 

3516
01:52:06,686 --> 01:52:08,721
PEOPLE INTEND IS TEXT TO MEAN  

3517
01:52:08,721 --> 01:52:09,288
SUBJECTIVELY.  

3518
01:52:09,288 --> 01:52:11,156
THAT HAS FALLEN OUT OF THE 

3519
01:52:11,156 --> 01:52:13,059
ANALYSIS BECAUSE,  FOR EXAMPLE, 

3520
01:52:13,059 --> 01:52:14,526
LET'S TAKE THE 14th AMENDMENT 

3521
01:52:14,526 --> 01:52:16,296
EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE.  

3522
01:52:16,296 --> 01:52:19,599
IT SAYS RIGHT IN THE TEXT EQUAL 

3523
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:21,534
THE SUPREME COURT SAID WHAT IS 

3524
01:52:21,534 --> 01:52:22,802
THAT BUT THE LAW SHALL BE THE 

3525
01:52:22,802 --> 01:52:25,171
SAME FOR THE BLACK AND THE 

3526
01:52:25,171 --> 01:52:26,439
WHITE.  

3527
01:52:26,439 --> 01:52:27,841
THAT IS BROWN VERSUS BOARD 

3528
01:52:27,841 --> 01:52:29,108
FOCUSING ON THE TEXT.  

3529
01:52:29,108 --> 01:52:31,945
BUT THERE WERE SOME RACEST 

3530
01:52:31,945 --> 01:52:33,213
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS INVOLVES 

3531
01:52:33,213 --> 01:52:36,382
THAT DIDN'T THING IT SHOULD 

3532
01:52:36,382 --> 01:52:40,186
APPLY IN THAT WAY TO CERTAIN 

3533
01:52:40,186 --> 01:52:42,589
ASPECTS OF THE PUBLIC LIFE.  

3534
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:44,457
IF YOU ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO 

3535
01:52:44,457 --> 01:52:45,892
THE TEXT YOU DON'T TAKE ACCOUNT 

3536
01:52:45,892 --> 01:52:47,927
OF THE  INTENTIONS,  NOR IS IT 

3537
01:52:47,927 --> 01:52:49,362
PROPER AS A GENERAL PROPOSITION 

3538
01:52:49,362 --> 01:52:50,897
TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE  

3539
01:52:50,897 --> 01:52:52,332
SUBJECTIVE INTENTIONS.  

3540
01:52:52,332 --> 01:52:54,500
THEY CAN BE EVIDENCE IN CERTAIN 

3541
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:55,335
CASES,  THE FIRST AMENDMENT,  

3542
01:52:55,335 --> 01:52:57,437
FOR EXAMPLE,  OF THE MEANING OF 

3543
01:52:57,437 --> 01:52:57,903
THE WORDS -- 

3544
01:52:57,903 --> 01:53:01,241
>> OF THE ORIGINAL PUBLIC 

3545
01:53:01,241 --> 01:53:01,508
MEETINGS? 

3546
01:53:01,508 --> 01:53:01,808
>> YES.  

3547
01:53:01,808 --> 01:53:03,475
OF THE ORIGINAL PUBLIC 

3548
01:53:03,475 --> 01:53:07,247
MEETINGS,  EVIDENCE OF THAT,  

3549
01:53:07,247 --> 01:53:09,282
BUT YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE 

3550
01:53:09,282 --> 01:53:09,515
INTENTIONS.  

3551
01:53:22,595 --> 01:53:24,664
AS I SAID REPEATEDLY,  YOU LOOK 

3552
01:53:24,664 --> 01:53:28,201
AT HISTORICAL,  THE HISTORY,  

3553
01:53:28,201 --> 01:53:30,603
THE TRADITION,  THE FEDERALIST 

3554
01:53:30,603 --> 01:53:33,139
37 TELLS US TO LOOK AT THE 

3555
01:53:33,139 --> 01:53:35,742
LIQUIDATION OF THE  MEETING BY 

3556
01:53:35,742 --> 01:53:38,578
HISTORICAL PRACTICE OVER TIME.  

3557
01:53:38,578 --> 01:53:39,878
THEN YOU LOOK AT PRECEDENT 

3558
01:53:39,878 --> 01:53:41,013
WOVEN INTO ARTICLE 3 AND 

3559
01:53:41,013 --> 01:53:41,814
FEDERALIST 78.  

3560
01:53:41,814 --> 01:53:43,348
START WITH THE  WORDS AS 

3561
01:53:43,348 --> 01:53:45,118
JUSTICE KAGAN SAID.  

3562
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:47,453
WE ARE ALL ORIGINALISTS NOW IN 

3563
01:53:47,453 --> 01:53:49,088
THAT RESPECT OF PAYING AT LEAST 

3564
01:53:49,088 --> 01:53:50,223
SOME ATTENTION TO,  OR MORE 

3565
01:53:50,223 --> 01:53:51,891
THAN SOME,  PAYING ATTENTION TO 

3566
01:53:51,891 --> 01:53:53,426
THE WORDS OF THE CONSTITUTION. 

3567
01:53:53,426 --> 01:53:54,961
>> SO IF WE STIPULATE FOR OUR 

3568
01:53:54,961 --> 01:53:58,331
PURPOSES TODAY AS WE ARE HAVING 

3569
01:53:58,331 --> 01:54:04,037
THIS CONVERSATION TODAY,  

3570
01:54:04,037 --> 01:54:05,305
ORIGINALISM REFERS TO BASICALLY 

3571
01:54:05,305 --> 01:54:07,674
TEXT YOU RECALLISM WITH THE 

3572
01:54:07,674 --> 01:54:08,775
IDENTIFYING THE PUBLIC MEANING 

3573
01:54:08,775 --> 01:54:10,009
OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT 

3574
01:54:10,009 --> 01:54:11,877
ISSUE YOU ARE AN ORIGINALIST? 

3575
01:54:11,877 --> 01:54:13,379
>> THAT IS CORRECT AND AS 

3576
01:54:13,379 --> 01:54:15,281
JUSTICE KAGAN SAID,  THAT IS 

3577
01:54:15,281 --> 01:54:17,450
WHAT SHE MEANT,  WE ARE ALL 

3578
01:54:17,450 --> 01:54:17,784
ORIGINALISTS NOW.  

3579
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:31,263
. 

3580
01:54:31,263 --> 01:54:35,601
>> WHAT WOULD ONE ARGUE AGAINST 

3581
01:54:35,601 --> 01:54:36,636
BEING A TEXTURALISM 

3582
01:54:36,636 --> 01:54:36,969
ORIGINALIST? 

3583
01:54:36,969 --> 01:54:38,203
>> WELL,  THERE ARE DIFFERENT 

3584
01:54:38,203 --> 01:54:39,072
PHILOSOPHIES OF WHAT A JUDGE 

3585
01:54:39,072 --> 01:54:39,672
DOES.  

3586
01:54:39,672 --> 01:54:41,341
BUT I THINK WHAT THE ROLE OF A 

3587
01:54:41,341 --> 01:54:42,842
JUDGE IS.  

3588
01:54:42,842 --> 01:54:44,911
BUT I THINK THE LAW -- ARTICLE 

3589
01:54:44,911 --> 01:54:48,014
6 OF THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THIS 

3590
01:54:48,014 --> 01:54:48,581
CONSTITUTION SHALL BE THE 

3591
01:54:48,581 --> 01:54:50,049
SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND.  

3592
01:54:50,049 --> 01:54:51,083
THE WORD LAW IS VERY IMPORTANT 

3593
01:54:51,083 --> 01:54:51,918
THERE.  

3594
01:54:51,918 --> 01:54:54,787
IT IS NOT A SET OF ASPIRATIONAL 

3595
01:54:54,787 --> 01:54:55,288
PRINCIPLES.  

3596
01:54:55,288 --> 01:54:57,857
IT IS LAW THAT CAN BE APPLIED 

3597
01:54:57,857 --> 01:55:00,093
IN COURT AND WHAT IS THE LAW? 

3598
01:55:00,093 --> 01:55:02,428
THE LAW OF THE WORD SO RATIFIED 

3599
01:55:02,428 --> 01:55:04,797
BY THE PEOPLE,  AND THEREFORE 

3600
01:55:04,797 --> 01:55:07,399
CAN BE APPLIED IN THE COURTS OF 

3601
01:55:07,399 --> 01:55:09,235
THE UNITED STATES.  

3602
01:55:09,235 --> 01:55:10,903
AND IT SAYS  THE SUPREME LAW -- 

3603
01:55:10,903 --> 01:55:14,107
WHAT DOES IT MEAN BY THAT? 

3604
01:55:14,107 --> 01:55:16,009
IT MEANS WHEN YOU PASS A 

3605
01:55:16,009 --> 01:55:18,144
STATUTE THAT IS INCONSISTENT 

3606
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:21,547
WITH THE CONSTITUTION,  THE 

3607
01:55:21,547 --> 01:55:24,784
SUPREME LAW CONTROLS NAMELY THE 

3608
01:55:24,784 --> 01:55:25,752
CONSTITUTION CONTROLS OVER A 

3609
01:55:25,752 --> 01:55:27,286
COUNTRY STATUE AND THAT IS OF 

3610
01:55:27,286 --> 01:55:28,287
COURSE,  DISCUSSED IN FEDERAL 

3611
01:55:28,287 --> 01:55:30,156
78,  AS WELL,  OF WHAT IS THE 

3612
01:55:30,156 --> 01:55:31,957
SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND AND THE 

3613
01:55:31,957 --> 01:55:34,360
CONSTITUTION IS THE SUPREME 

3614
01:55:34,360 --> 01:55:35,628
LAW.  

3615
01:55:35,628 --> 01:55:38,064
AGAIN,  PRECEDENT,  HISTORICAL 

3616
01:55:38,064 --> 01:55:38,998
PRACTICE,  SUBSEQUENT TO THE 

3617
01:55:38,998 --> 01:55:40,633
PASSING OF THE TEXT.  

3618
01:55:40,633 --> 01:55:43,503
WE SEE THAT FOR EXAMPLE IN 

3619
01:55:43,503 --> 01:55:44,704
ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE CASES THE 

3620
01:55:44,704 --> 01:55:46,539
COURT WILL OVEN LOOK AT THE 

3621
01:55:46,539 --> 01:55:48,241
HISTORICAL PRACTICE AND 

3622
01:55:48,241 --> 01:55:49,609
PRECEDENT ROOTED IN ARTICLE 3,  

3623
01:55:49,609 --> 01:55:50,943
THOSE THINGS ALL GO INTO IT,  

3624
01:55:50,943 --> 01:55:53,278
BUT THE RECORDS,  THE ORIGINAL 

3625
01:55:53,278 --> 01:55:56,983
PUBLIC MEETING ARE AN IMPORTANT 

3626
01:55:56,983 --> 01:55:57,917
PART OF CONSTITUTIONAL 

3627
01:55:57,917 --> 01:56:00,286
INTERPRET AND HAS BEEN I THINK, 

3628
01:56:00,286 --> 01:56:00,586
THROUGHOUT. 

3629
01:56:00,586 --> 01:56:05,157
>> LET'S SUPPOSE CONGRESS IN 

3630
01:56:05,157 --> 01:56:07,293
ITS INFINITE WISDOM WITH IT'S 

3631
01:56:07,293 --> 01:56:10,029
APPROVAL RATE THAT  RANGES 

3632
01:56:10,029 --> 01:56:16,436
BETWEEN 9% AND 11% MAKING US 

3633
01:56:16,436 --> 01:56:17,203
SLIGHTLY LESS PROPER THAT ARE 

3634
01:56:17,203 --> 01:56:19,405
WALL,  WHAT IF WE DECIDE WE ARE 

3635
01:56:19,405 --> 01:56:21,040
ALL BUSY,  THERE ARE PARADES TO 

3636
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:24,910
ATTEND,  THERE ARE POLITICAL 

3637
01:56:24,910 --> 01:56:28,747
RALLIES TO ORGANIZE,  THAT WE 

3638
01:56:28,747 --> 01:56:31,751
GET TIRED OF THE BUSY WORK OF 

3639
01:56:31,751 --> 01:56:33,820
MAKING LAWS AND WE DON'T WANT 

3640
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:34,820
TO MAKE OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE 

3641
01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:36,155
FOR THE LAWS WE PASS.  

3642
01:56:36,155 --> 01:56:39,125
IT IS MUCH EASIER TO PASS A 

3643
01:56:39,125 --> 01:56:39,558
BROADER STATEMENT.  

3644
01:56:39,558 --> 01:56:40,860
WE SAY WE HEREBY PASS A LAW 

3645
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:42,395
THAT SAYS WE IN THE UNITED 

3646
01:56:42,395 --> 01:56:44,230
STATES OF AMERICA SHALL HAVE 

3647
01:56:44,230 --> 01:56:46,899
GOOD LAW AND HERE BY DELEGATE 

3648
01:56:46,899 --> 01:56:48,500
TO WITH HERE WITH CREATED 

3649
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:49,969
UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON THE 

3650
01:56:49,969 --> 01:56:52,171
ECONOMIC OF GOOD LAW,  THE 

3651
01:56:52,171 --> 01:56:53,673
POWER TO PROMULGATE,  INTERPRET 

3652
01:56:53,673 --> 01:56:54,841
AND ENFORCE GOOD LAWS IN THE 

3653
01:56:54,841 --> 01:56:55,875
UNITED STATES.  

3654
01:56:55,875 --> 01:57:00,913
WHAT CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES DO 

3655
01:57:00,913 --> 01:57:01,546
YOU SEE THERE? 

3656
01:57:01,546 --> 01:57:03,349
>> SENATOR,  THE CONGRESS IS OF 

3657
01:57:03,349 --> 01:57:04,950
COURSE ASSIGNED THE LEGISLATIVE 

3658
01:57:04,950 --> 01:57:07,120
POWER IN ARTICLE 1 OF THE 

3659
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:10,289
CONSTITUTION,  SO IF IT 

3660
01:57:10,289 --> 01:57:13,226
DELEGATES WHOLESALE OF THE 

3661
01:57:13,226 --> 01:57:14,760
CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO ANOTHER 

3662
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:17,230
BODY,  THEN THAT NATURALLY  

3663
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:20,066
POSES A QUESTION OF WHETHER THE 

3664
01:57:20,066 --> 01:57:23,035
BODY EXERCISING THAT POWER 

3665
01:57:23,035 --> 01:57:24,236
ULTIMATELY HAS IMPROPERLY 

3666
01:57:24,236 --> 01:57:25,972
EXERCISED THE LEGISLATIVE POWER 

3667
01:57:25,972 --> 01:57:27,106
AND WHETHER THAT RULE OR WHAT 

3668
01:57:27,106 --> 01:57:30,243
HAVE YOU THAT IS ENACTED BY 

3669
01:57:30,243 --> 01:57:32,311
THAT BODY IS LAWFUL BECAUSE IT 

3670
01:57:32,311 --> 01:57:34,713
WAS NOT ENACTED BY CONGRESS.  

3671
01:57:34,713 --> 01:57:37,216
SO,  THE FRAMERS  INTENDED THAT 

3672
01:57:37,216 --> 01:57:40,286
CONGRESS WOULD EBB ACT THE LAWS 

3673
01:57:40,286 --> 01:57:41,754
AND THAT THE EXECUTIVE WOULD 

3674
01:57:41,754 --> 01:57:43,322
ENFORCE THE LAWS AND THE 

3675
01:57:43,322 --> 01:57:45,024
JUDICIARY WOULD,  OF COURSE, 

3676
01:57:45,024 --> 01:57:46,959
RESOLVE CASES AND CONTROVERSIES 

3677
01:57:46,959 --> 01:57:47,960
ARISING UNDER THOSE  LAWS. 

3678
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:50,062
>> AND YET IN SOME RESPECTS IT 

3679
01:57:50,062 --> 01:57:51,998
IS NOT THAT FAR REMOVED FROM 

3680
01:57:51,998 --> 01:57:54,033
SOME OF WHAT WE DO TODAY.  

3681
01:57:54,033 --> 01:57:56,369
WE MAY NOT PASS SOMETHIG AS 

3682
01:57:56,369 --> 01:57:58,604
EXTREME AS I  DESCRIBED IN MY 

3683
01:57:58,604 --> 01:57:59,939
HYPOTHETICAL BUT IN SOME CASES 

3684
01:57:59,939 --> 01:58:02,575
WE SAY WE HAVE GOOD LAW IN AREA 

3685
01:58:02,575 --> 01:58:03,943
X AND GIVE COMMISSION Y THE 

3686
01:58:03,943 --> 01:58:06,979
POWER TO MAKE AND ENFORCE GOOD 

3687
01:58:06,979 --> 01:58:09,682
LAWS  IN THAT AREA.  

3688
01:58:09,682 --> 01:58:12,952
SO,  AT SOME POINT AT WHICH WE 

3689
01:58:12,952 --> 01:58:14,987
CROSS A THRESHOLD OF 

3690
01:58:14,987 --> 01:58:15,587
UNCONSTITUTIONAL DELEGATION? 

3691
01:58:15,587 --> 01:58:16,522
>> WELL,  THE SUPREME COURT,  

3692
01:58:16,522 --> 01:58:20,959
AS YOU KNOW SENATOR,  HAS A  

3693
01:58:20,959 --> 01:58:22,628
NON-DELEGATION  PRINCIPLE.  

3694
01:58:22,628 --> 01:58:26,899
AT LEAST UNDER OUR CURRENT 

3695
01:58:26,899 --> 01:58:28,134
PRECEDENT IS ALLOWED THE 

3696
01:58:28,134 --> 01:58:29,569
DELEGATION -- AND I DON'T WANT 

3697
01:58:29,569 --> 01:58:31,370
TO GET TOO SPECIFIC HERE,  BUT 

3698
01:58:31,370 --> 01:58:33,339
IT IS ALLOWED SOME DELEGATION.  

3699
01:58:33,339 --> 01:58:34,807
SOME JUSTICES OR JUDGES WOULD 

3700
01:58:34,807 --> 01:58:37,943
SAY ACTUALLY WHEN THE EXECUTIVE 

3701
01:58:37,943 --> 01:58:39,412
ENACTS RULES PURSUANT TO THOSE 

3702
01:58:39,412 --> 01:58:40,846
DELEGATIONS,  THAT IS THE 

3703
01:58:40,846 --> 01:58:43,216
EXERCISE OF GIVE POWER,  BUT I 

3704
01:58:43,216 --> 01:58:44,216
THINK THERE HAS BEEN SOME  

3705
01:58:44,216 --> 01:58:45,685
PUSHBACK ON THAT.  

3706
01:58:45,685 --> 01:58:47,353
IN ANY EVENT THE SUPREME COURT 

3707
01:58:47,353 --> 01:58:51,223
HAS A DOCTRINE ON THE NON-

3708
01:58:51,223 --> 01:58:53,259
DELEGATION PRINCIPLE AND THE 

3709
01:58:53,259 --> 01:58:54,727
LINE IS DEBATED ON WHERE THAT 

3710
01:58:54,727 --> 01:58:56,929
SHOULD BE DRAWN,  BUT THERE IS 

3711
01:58:56,929 --> 01:58:59,098
PRECEDENT THAT DOES SUGGEST 

3712
01:58:59,098 --> 01:59:00,533
THAT AT SOME POINT CONGRESS CAN 

3713
01:59:00,533 --> 01:59:03,903
GO TOO FAR IN HOW MUCH POWER IT 

3714
01:59:03,903 --> 01:59:06,072
DELEGATES TO AN EXECUTIVE OR 

3715
01:59:06,072 --> 01:59:06,706
INDEPENDENT AGENC 

3716
01:59:06,706 --> 01:59:09,175
>> AND WHEN WE DO THAT AT SOME 

3717
01:59:09,175 --> 01:59:11,711
POINT WE ARE SHIRKING OUR OWN 

3718
01:59:11,711 --> 01:59:13,879
RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE WE ARE 

3719
01:59:13,879 --> 01:59:15,981
MAKING LAWMAKERS RATHER THAN 

3720
01:59:15,981 --> 01:59:16,882
LAWS AND CONSOLIDATING INTO ONE 

3721
01:59:16,882 --> 01:59:19,051
BODY THE POWER TO MAKE AND 

3722
01:59:19,051 --> 01:59:21,053
ENFORCE LAWS WHICH IS NOT ONLY 

3723
01:59:21,053 --> 01:59:22,621
SOMETHING THAT CAN LEAD TO  

3724
01:59:22,621 --> 01:59:24,223
TIERNEY,  THE VERY DEFINITION 

3725
01:59:24,223 --> 01:59:24,991
OF TIERNEY ITSELF.  

3726
01:59:24,991 --> 01:59:27,326
I WANT TO GET TO THE CAM ATTAIN 

3727
01:59:27,326 --> 01:59:29,061
FINANCE DISCUSSION YOU WERE 

3728
01:59:29,061 --> 01:59:30,295
HAVING A -- CAMPAIGN FINANCE 

3729
01:59:30,295 --> 01:59:33,932
DISCUSSION YOU WERE HAVING A 

3730
01:59:33,932 --> 01:59:35,768
FEW MINUTES AGO WITH SENATOR 

3731
01:59:35,768 --> 01:59:36,269
WHITEHOUSE.  

3732
01:59:36,269 --> 01:59:37,969
DIDN'T THE SUPREME COURT UPHOLD 

3733
01:59:37,969 --> 01:59:40,139
THE REQUIREMENTS AT ISSUE IN 

3734
01:59:40,139 --> 01:59:40,539
CITIZENS UNITED? 

3735
01:59:40,539 --> 01:59:43,509
>> IT DID.  

3736
01:59:43,509 --> 01:59:46,245
I BELIEVE THAT WAS AN 8-1 

3737
01:59:46,245 --> 01:59:46,479
MARGIN. 

3738
01:59:46,479 --> 01:59:48,147

THIS THAT THERE IS DISTINCTION 

3740
01:59:51,817 --> 01:59:53,819
FOR FIRST AMENDMENT  PURPOSES,  

3741
01:59:53,819 --> 01:59:55,288

SOMETHING,  ISN'T THAT RIGHT? 

3746
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:01,360
>> THAT IS WHAT THE SUPREME 

3747
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:03,629
COURT HAS SAID IN CERTAIN 

3748
02:00:03,629 --> 02:00:06,232
CONTEXT AND THAT IS THE LAW 

3749
02:00:06,232 --> 02:00:07,166
ASSET FORTH BY THE SUPREME 

3750
02:00:07,166 --> 02:00:09,402

3755
02:00:18,177 --> 02:00:21,246

THE SUPREME COURT LAW AND

>> NO,  RIGHT! 

3773
02:01:02,754 --> 02:01:06,325
[ LAUGHING ] I LIKE A LOT OF  

3774
02:01:06,325 --> 02:01:06,992
FEDERALIST PAPERS.  

3775
02:01:06,992 --> 02:01:09,895
FEDERAL 78,  OF COURSE,  THE 

3776
02:01:09,895 --> 02:01:10,896
INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY,  THE 

3777
02:01:10,896 --> 02:01:14,400
ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY.  

3778
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:15,634
FEDERAL 69 WHICH SAYS  THE 

3779
02:01:15,634 --> 02:01:18,371
PRESIDENCY IS NOT A MONARCHY.  

3780
02:01:18,371 --> 02:01:19,505
VERY IMPORTANT WHEN HAMILTON 

3781
02:01:19,505 --> 02:01:20,539
EXPLAINS ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH 

3782
02:01:20,539 --> 02:01:22,375
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT A MONARCHY 

3783
02:01:22,375 --> 02:01:23,476
IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM.  

3784
02:01:23,476 --> 02:01:26,212
I THINK THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. 

3785
02:01:26,212 --> 02:01:28,614
FEDERALIST 10 WHICH TALKS ABOUT 

3786
02:01:28,614 --> 02:01:31,550
FACTIONS IN AMERICA.  

3787
02:01:31,550 --> 02:01:32,518
AND EXPLAINS THAT HAVING THE 

3788
02:01:32,518 --> 02:01:34,185
SEPARATION OF POWERS IN THE 

3789
02:01:34,185 --> 02:01:37,323
FEDERALISM  SYSTEM,  DIVIDING 

3790
02:01:37,323 --> 02:01:40,526
POWER IN SO MANY DIFFERENT  

3791
02:01:40,526 --> 02:01:41,227
WAYS WOULD HELP PREVENT A 

3792
02:01:41,227 --> 02:01:42,228
FACTION FROM GAINING CONTROL OF 

3793
02:01:42,228 --> 02:01:43,662
ALL THE POWER FOR THE PEOPLE OF 

3794
02:01:43,662 --> 02:01:45,931
THE UNITED STATES AND THAT 

3795
02:01:45,931 --> 02:01:47,366
MAKES IT FRUSTRATING AT TIMES 

3796
02:01:47,366 --> 02:01:49,301
BECAUSE IT IS HARD TO PASS NEW 

3797
02:01:49,301 --> 02:01:51,003
LEGISLATION,  BUT THAT ALSO,  

3798
02:01:51,003 --> 02:01:53,038
THAT DIVISION OF POWER,  HELPS 

3799
02:01:53,038 --> 02:01:53,873
PROTECT INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY.  

3800
02:01:53,873 --> 02:01:57,209
I THINK THAT COMES A BIT FROM  

3801
02:01:57,209 --> 02:01:58,077
FEDERALIST 10.  

3802
02:01:58,077 --> 02:01:59,412
FEDERALIST 37 AND 39 TALK 

3803
02:01:59,412 --> 02:02:02,515
ABOUT,  ON THE ONE HAND HOW WE 

3804
02:02:02,515 --> 02:02:05,050
ARE JUST TALKING LAWS THAT ARE 

3805
02:02:05,050 --> 02:02:07,987
THE CONSTITUTION OVER TIME CAN 

3806
02:02:07,987 --> 02:02:08,954
BE TERMED LIQUIDATED BY 

3807
02:02:08,954 --> 02:02:09,955
HISTORICAL PRACTICE.  

3808
02:02:09,955 --> 02:02:11,090
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 

3809
02:02:11,090 --> 02:02:14,894
THAT MEANS THAT AS THE BRANCHES 

3810
02:02:14,894 --> 02:02:16,228
FILL OUT THE MEANING OF THE 

3811
02:02:16,228 --> 02:02:17,863
CONSTITUTION OVER TIME WITH 

3812
02:02:17,863 --> 02:02:19,398
PRACTICES,  THOSE CAN BE 

3813
02:02:19,398 --> 02:02:22,668
RELEVANT IN HOW THE COURT  

3814
02:02:22,668 --> 02:02:26,172
SUBSEQUENTLY INTERPRETS CERTAIN 

3815
02:02:26,172 --> 02:02:26,872
PROVISIONS.  

3816
02:02:26,872 --> 02:02:28,773
WE TALK ALSO ABOUT THE NATIONAL 

3817
02:02:28,773 --> 02:02:33,512
AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS.  

3818
02:02:33,512 --> 02:02:37,016
THE COMBINATION THAT WE  HAVE,  

3819
02:02:37,016 --> 02:02:38,951
THIS ODD -- THAT IS THE GENIUS 

3820
02:02:38,951 --> 02:02:40,486
RIGHTS OF HAVING A NATIONAL 

3821
02:02:40,486 --> 02:02:41,620
GOVERNMENT PLUS STATE 

3822
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:43,322
GOVERNMENTS AND WITHIN THE 

3823
02:02:43,322 --> 02:02:45,391
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT THE HOUSE 

3824
02:02:45,391 --> 02:02:46,692
IS  PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION 

3825
02:02:46,692 --> 02:02:48,661
AND THE SENATE IS STATE 

3826
02:02:48,661 --> 02:02:49,762
REPRESENTATION.  

3827
02:02:49,762 --> 02:02:50,663
THAT INTERESTING COMPROMISE 

3828
02:02:50,663 --> 02:02:52,731
WHICH MADISON,  BY THE WAY,  

3829
02:02:52,731 --> 02:02:55,501
WAS OPPOSED TO,  THE COMPROMISE 

3830
02:02:55,501 --> 02:02:56,802
AT THE CONVECTION.  

3831
02:02:56,802 --> 02:02:59,438
FEDERALIST 47,  THE 

3832
02:02:59,438 --> 02:03:00,473
ACCUMULATION OF ALL POWER IN 

3833
02:03:00,473 --> 02:03:02,408
ONE BODY IS THE VERY DEFINITION 

3834
02:03:02,408 --> 02:03:03,242
OF TIERNEY.  

3835
02:03:03,242 --> 02:03:05,210
I START MY SEPARATION OF POWERS 

3836
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:07,746
CLASS EVERY YEAR WITH THAT 

3837
02:03:07,746 --> 02:03:10,716
EXACT QUOTE YOU READ YESTERDAY, 

3838
02:03:10,716 --> 02:03:12,485
BECAUSE THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. 

3839
02:03:12,485 --> 02:03:16,155
51,  IF MEN WERE ANGELS WE 

3840
02:03:16,155 --> 02:03:17,389
WOULD NOT NEED GOVERNMENT.  

3841
02:03:17,389 --> 02:03:21,961
SO, I AM SORRY,  I HAVE EIGHT  

3842
02:03:21,961 --> 02:03:22,862
KID 

3843
02:03:22,862 --> 02:03:26,031
>> IT IS BRILLIANT AND A 

3844
02:03:26,031 --> 02:03:28,067
GREATEST HITS LIST IF THESE 

3845
02:03:28,067 --> 02:03:29,502
WERE ON SPOTIFY AND YOU PUT 

3846
02:03:29,502 --> 02:03:32,338
TOGETHER A LIST OF THOS 

3847
02:03:32,338 --> 02:03:34,340
[ LAUGHING ] LET'S CLOSE IN THE 

3848
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:35,975
MINUTE-AND-A-HALF I HAVE LEFT,  

3849
02:03:35,975 --> 02:03:37,643
I GAVE MYSELF AN ADDITIONAL 30 

3850
02:03:37,643 --> 02:03:39,745
SECONDS BECAUSE OF THE TWO 

3851
02:03:39,745 --> 02:03:40,880
INTERRUPTIONS THERE.  

3852
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:44,015
TELL ME HOW YOU WERE INFORMED 

3853
02:03:44,015 --> 02:03:46,952
BY FEDERALIST 51 AND HOW THAT 

3854
02:03:46,952 --> 02:03:48,687
RELATES TO YOUR ROLE AT A 

3855
02:03:48,687 --> 02:03:50,355
JURIST NOW IN THE D.C. CIRCUIT 

3856
02:03:50,355 --> 02:03:52,023
AND THE ROLE YOU WOULD PLAY IF 

3857
02:03:52,023 --> 02:03:53,526
YOU WERE  CONFIRMED  TO THE 

3858
02:03:53,526 --> 02:03:54,727
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT? 

3859
02:03:54,727 --> 02:03:56,262
THIS UNDERSTAND THAT GOVERNMENT 

3860
02:03:56,262 --> 02:03:57,496
IS AN EXERCISE IN  

3861
02:03:57,496 --> 02:03:59,198
UNDERSTANDING HUMAN NATURE.  

3862
02:03:59,198 --> 02:04:01,567
IF WE WERE ANGELS WE WOULD NOT 

3863
02:04:01,567 --> 02:04:02,801
NEED GOVERNMENT.  

3864
02:04:02,801 --> 02:04:05,704
IF WE HAD ACCESS OF ANGELS TO 

3865
02:04:05,704 --> 02:04:08,574
GOVERN OVER US WE WOULD NOT 

3866
02:04:08,574 --> 02:04:10,209
NEED ALL THESE CUMBERSOME RULES 

3867
02:04:10,209 --> 02:04:11,176
THAT MAKE GOVERNMENT SO 

3868
02:04:11,176 --> 02:04:12,778
INEFFICIENT AND FRUSTRATING.  

3869
02:04:12,778 --> 02:04:13,979
WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT AND HOW 

3870
02:04:13,979 --> 02:04:16,482
DOES THAT EFFECT YOU AS A JUDGE 

3871
02:04:16,482 --> 02:04:18,417
WHEN TRYING TO INTERPRET THE 

3872
02:04:18,417 --> 02:04:20,619
CONSTITUTION AND INTERPRET THE 

3873
02:04:20,619 --> 02:04:21,686
ACTS TAKEN PURSUANT THERE TO. 

3874
02:04:21,686 --> 02:04:22,521
>> THAT IS AN INTERESTING 

3875
02:04:22,521 --> 02:04:23,322
QUESTION,  SENATOR.  

3876
02:04:23,322 --> 02:04:26,325
I THINK WE RECOGNIZE WE ARE ALL 

3877
02:04:26,325 --> 02:04:29,027
IMPERFECT,  FIRST OF ALL ALL OF 

3878
02:04:29,027 --> 02:04:30,762
US AS HUMANS  ARE IMPERFECT 

3879
02:04:30,762 --> 02:04:32,064
THAT.  

3880
02:04:32,064 --> 02:04:33,065
INCLUDES JUDGES AND LEGISLATORS 

3881
02:04:33,065 --> 02:04:38,804
AND ALL OF US ARE IMPERFECT.  

3882
02:04:38,804 --> 02:04:42,274
SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT IN HOW WE 

3883
02:04:42,274 --> 02:04:43,509
GO ABOUT SETTING UP OUR 

3884
02:04:43,509 --> 02:04:44,443
GOVERNMENT.  

3885
02:04:44,443 --> 02:04:45,544
IF THERE WERE SOME PERFECT 

3886
02:04:45,544 --> 02:04:47,279
GROUP OF PEOPLE WE WOULD PUT 

3887
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:49,281
ALL THE POWER IN THAT ONE BODY. 

3888
02:04:49,281 --> 02:04:51,216
BUT BECAUSE WE ARE IMPERFECT,  

3889
02:04:51,216 --> 02:04:54,486
PUTTING ALL THE POWER IN THAT 

3890
02:04:54,486 --> 02:04:56,187
ONE BODY WOULD BE,  THE 

3891
02:04:56,187 --> 02:04:57,056
DEFINITION OF TEARY.  

3892
02:04:57,056 --> 02:05:00,292
I THINK THE WAY WE DEAL WITH 

3893
02:05:00,292 --> 02:05:03,062
THE IMPERFECTION WHILE HAVING A 

3894
02:05:03,062 --> 02:05:04,897
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE ARE 

3895
02:05:04,897 --> 02:05:05,964
IMPERFECT,  DIVIDING AND 

3896
02:05:05,964 --> 02:05:08,367
SEPARATING THE  POWER,  TO MIND 

3897
02:05:08,367 --> 02:05:10,903
REENFORCES WHY THE FRAMERS,  

3898
02:05:10,903 --> 02:05:12,438
THE GENIUS DESPITE THE FLAWS IN 

3899
02:05:12,438 --> 02:05:13,672
THE CONSTITUTION AND THERE WERE 

3900
02:05:13,672 --> 02:05:15,941
FLAW,  THE GENIUS OF SEPARATING 

3901
02:05:15,941 --> 02:05:17,443
THE LEGISLATIVE EXECUTIVE,  

3902
02:05:17,443 --> 02:05:18,577
JUDICIAL POWER,  TILTING TOWARD 

3903
02:05:18,577 --> 02:05:20,112
LIBERTY IN ALL THOSE RESPECTS 

3904
02:05:20,112 --> 02:05:21,580
AND HAVING A FEDERAL SYSTEM 

3905
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:23,615
WHERE WE STILL HAVE STATE 

3906
02:05:23,615 --> 02:05:24,549
GOVERNMENTS THAT CAN FURTHER 

3907
02:05:24,549 --> 02:05:25,950
PROTECT LIBERTY AND THE 

3908
02:05:25,950 --> 02:05:27,019
LABORATORIES OF DEMOCRACY,  AS 

3909
02:05:27,019 --> 02:05:27,519
WELL.  

3910
02:05:27,519 --> 02:05:30,956
I THINK ALL THAT IS BECAUSE WE 

3911
02:05:30,956 --> 02:05:32,991
ARE IMPERFECT AND BECAUSE WE 

3912
02:05:32,991 --> 02:05:34,159
RECOGNIZE THE IMPERFECTIONS.  

3913
02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:37,029
IT IS ALSO WHY WE HAVE THINGS 

3914
02:05:37,029 --> 02:05:39,465
LIKE A JURY SYSTEM AND EVEN 

3915
02:05:39,465 --> 02:05:43,235
WITHIN THE JUDICIARY WE DIDN'T 

3916
02:05:43,235 --> 02:05:45,671
TRUST A JUDGE TO TRIALS ON HIS 

3917
02:05:45,671 --> 02:05:48,407
OR HER OWN CRIMINAL TRIALS.  

3918
02:05:48,407 --> 02:05:49,675
OR CIVIL TRIALS.  

3919
02:05:49,675 --> 02:05:51,310
WE HAVE A JURY SYSTEM TO 

3920
02:05:51,310 --> 02:05:54,146
RECOGNIZE AND WE HAVE USUALLY 

3921
02:05:54,146 --> 02:05:56,148
12 AND THAT IS DESIGNED  TO 

3922
02:05:56,148 --> 02:05:56,915
RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE IMPERFECT 

3923
02:05:56,915 --> 02:05:58,884
AND SOMETIMES THAT IS WHY WE 

3924
02:05:58,884 --> 02:06:01,854
HAVE GROUP DECISION-MAKING.  

3925
02:06:01,854 --> 02:06:04,323
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE 535 

3926
02:06:04,323 --> 02:06:06,959
LEGISLATURES AND 9 JUSTICES.  

3927
02:06:06,959 --> 02:06:07,893
WE DON'T USUALLY HAVE ONE 

3928
02:06:07,893 --> 02:06:08,694
PERSON.  

3929
02:06:08,694 --> 02:06:11,664
I THINK THAT ALL MAYBE STEMS 

3930
02:06:11,664 --> 02:06:13,599
FROM THE SAME PHILOSOPHICAL  

3931
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:15,767
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE 

3932
02:06:15,767 --> 02:06:17,369
IMPERFECT BEINGS AND WE DIVIDE 

3933
02:06:17,369 --> 02:06:20,406
POWER AND MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE 

3934
02:06:20,406 --> 02:06:22,775
PERSON IN A JURY SITUATION OR 

3935
02:06:22,775 --> 02:06:23,709

3936
02:06:23,709 --> 02:06:24,977
LIBERTY CAN BE EFFECTED IS 

3937
02:06:24,977 --> 02:06:25,444
EXERCISING TOTAL CONTROL.  

3938

SECOND HEARING, APPEARING 

3951
02:09:49,081 --> 02:09:50,249
BEFORE THE HOUSE ENERGY AND 

3952
02:09:50,249 --> 02:09:51,249
COMMERCE COMMITTEE. 

3953
02:09:51,249 --> 02:09:55,654
THEY ARE HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF 

3954
02:09:55,654 --> 02:09:56,287
CENSORING CONSERVATIVE VOICES. 

3955
02:09:56,287 --> 02:09:58,357
>>  EIGHT TO TEN MILLION ACTS 

3956
02:09:58,357 --> 02:09:59,958
PER MONTH, IS THAT RIGHT? 

3957
02:09:59,958 --> 02:10:00,659
>>  PER WEEK. 

3958
02:10:00,659 --> 02:10:01,360
>>  PER WEEK. 

3959
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:06,565
>>  TO STOP OVER A HALF MILLION 

3960
02:10:06,565 --> 02:10:07,132
ACCOUNTS EVERY DAY. 

3961
02:10:07,132 --> 02:10:08,734
>>  CAN TWITTER KEEP UP? 

3962
02:10:08,734 --> 02:10:12,638
>>   

3963
02:10:17,776 --> 02:10:18,510
. 

3964
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:21,013
>>  IF THEY USE AUTOMATED ACTS 

3965
02:10:21,013 --> 02:10:22,347
DON'T THEY OVERWHELM TWITTER 

3966
02:10:22,347 --> 02:10:23,782
AND AFFECT YOUR FORMULA? 

3967
02:10:23,782 --> 02:10:25,783
>>  I MEAN IT'S DEFINITELY 

3968
02:10:25,783 --> 02:10:28,153
OTHERS HAVE DESCRIBED IT AS AN 

3969
02:10:28,153 --> 02:10:30,956
ARMS RACE BUT I BELIEVE IT'S 

3970
02:10:30,956 --> 02:10:32,390
VERY MUCH LIKE SECURITY. 

3971
02:10:32,390 --> 02:10:33,959
THERE IS NO PERFECT END POINT. 

3972
02:10:33,959 --> 02:10:35,060
WHEN YOU BUILD A LOCK SOMEONE 

3973
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:38,363
ELSE WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO 

3974
02:10:38,363 --> 02:10:39,430
BREAK IT. 

3975
02:10:39,430 --> 02:10:42,267
YOU CAN'T TRY TO DESIGN FOR THE 

3976
02:10:42,267 --> 02:10:42,600
PERFECT LOCK. 

3977
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:47,139
>>  CAN'T YOU IDENTITY THE BOTS 

3978
02:10:47,139 --> 02:10:49,541
AT LEAST AS THEY SIGN UP SO 

3979
02:10:49,541 --> 02:10:50,742
THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING 

3980
02:10:50,742 --> 02:10:51,944
THAT'S A FAKE AUTOMATED 

3981
02:10:51,944 --> 02:10:52,444
ACCOUNT? 

3982
02:10:52,444 --> 02:10:55,747
>>  IN CERTAIN CASES WE CAN. 

3983
02:10:55,747 --> 02:10:56,848
IT'S A GREAT POINT. 

3984
02:10:56,848 --> 02:10:57,682
ESPECIALLY THROUGH OUR API. 

3985
02:10:57,682 --> 02:11:01,086
THERE ARE MORE HIGH END WAYS OF 

3986
02:11:01,086 --> 02:11:02,654
AUTOMATION THAT ACTUALLY SCRIPT 

3987
02:11:02,654 --> 02:11:06,091
OUR SITE AND OUR APP THAT ARE 

3988
02:11:06,091 --> 02:11:07,459
MUCH HARDER TO DETECT. 

3989
02:11:07,459 --> 02:11:09,628
THEY ARE INTENDING TO LOOK LIKE 

3990
02:11:09,628 --> 02:11:10,462
HUMAN BEHAVIOR WITH THE 

3991
02:11:10,462 --> 02:11:12,597
SLOWNESS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR 

3992
02:11:12,597 --> 02:11:14,199
RATHER THAN THE SPEED THROUGH 

3993
02:11:14,199 --> 02:11:15,467
AN API. 

3994
02:11:15,467 --> 02:11:17,202
IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED. 

3995
02:11:17,202 --> 02:11:18,937
IT'S NOT A CHALLENGE WE ARE NOT 

3996
02:11:18,937 --> 02:11:19,370
INTENDING TO FACE. 

3997
02:11:19,370 --> 02:11:20,639
WE ARE TAKING IT HEAD ON. 

3998
02:11:20,639 --> 02:11:21,974
>>  YOU HAVE SOME CREATIVE 

3999
02:11:21,974 --> 02:11:24,142
MINDS, I WOULD THINK YOU CAN 

4000
02:11:24,142 --> 02:11:26,345
PUT ALL OF THOSE CREATIVE 

4001
02:11:26,345 --> 02:11:27,279
MINDS, ALL OF YOUR EXPERIENCE 

4002
02:11:27,279 --> 02:11:28,146
TO WORK TO DO THAT. 

4003
02:11:28,146 --> 02:11:30,882
I WANT TO ASK YOU A LITTLE 

4004
02:11:30,882 --> 02:11:31,249
ABOUT PRIVACY. 

4005
02:11:31,249 --> 02:11:33,085
TWITTER AND OTHER COMPANIES 

4006
02:11:33,085 --> 02:11:35,287
COLLECT INFORMATION ON USERS 

4007
02:11:35,287 --> 02:11:37,689
AND NONUSERS, OFTEN WITHOUT 

4008
02:11:37,689 --> 02:11:38,089
THEIR KNOWLEDGE. 

4009
02:11:38,089 --> 02:11:39,491
TWITTER'S BUSINESS MODEL IS 

4010
02:11:39,491 --> 02:11:41,293
BASED ON ADVERTISING AND YOU 

4011
02:11:41,293 --> 02:11:42,894
SERVE TARGETED ADVERTISING TO 

4012
02:11:42,894 --> 02:11:45,197
USERS BASS ON VAST AMOUNTS OF 

4013
02:11:45,197 --> 02:11:49,167
DATA THAT YOU COLLECT WHICH 

4014
02:11:49,167 --> 02:11:50,569
RAISES CONSUMER PRIVACY 

4015
02:11:50,569 --> 02:11:50,836
CONCERNS. 

4016
02:11:50,836 --> 02:11:53,038
YOU -- UP UNTIL LAST YEAR YOU 

4017
02:11:53,038 --> 02:11:54,773
-- THE PRIVACY POLICY INCLUDED 

4018
02:11:54,773 --> 02:11:56,274
A PROMISE TO SUPPORT DO NOT 

4019
02:11:56,274 --> 02:12:00,578
TRACK BUT THEN YOU CHANGED YOUR 

4020
02:12:00,578 --> 02:12:00,778
MIND. 

4021
02:12:00,778 --> 02:12:00,979
WHY? 

4022
02:12:00,979 --> 02:12:04,883
WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE UP TO 

4023
02:12:04,883 --> 02:12:06,785
CONSUMERS, WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE 

4024
02:12:06,785 --> 02:12:07,686
THE CONSUMERS CHOICE? 

4025
02:12:07,686 --> 02:12:10,789
>>  WE DO LET CONSUMERS TURN 

4026
02:12:10,789 --> 02:12:12,591
OFF TRACKING ACROSS THE WEB. 

4027
02:12:12,591 --> 02:12:16,395
>>  BUT THEY CANNOT -- ARE YOU 

4028
02:12:16,395 --> 02:12:18,897
STILL ABLE TO BUILD THE PROFILE 

4029
02:12:18,897 --> 02:12:20,899
ON EACH AND EVERY USER. 

4030
02:12:20,899 --> 02:12:21,966
ISN'T THAT CORRECT? 

4031
02:12:21,966 --> 02:12:25,837
>>  IF THEY LOG INTO THE 

4032
02:12:25,837 --> 02:12:26,805
ACCOUNT THEN YES AND WE LET 

4033
02:12:26,805 --> 02:12:30,142
THEM TURN THAT OFF. 

4034
02:12:30,142 --> 02:12:31,676
>>  I UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN WHEN 

4035
02:12:31,676 --> 02:12:33,478
THEY OPT OUT YOU ARE STILL 

4036
02:12:33,478 --> 02:12:34,546
COLLECTING DATA ON THEM. 

4037
02:12:34,546 --> 02:12:35,480
YOU ARE STILL TRACKING THEM. 

4038
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:37,215
>>  I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE 

4039
02:12:37,215 --> 02:12:38,984
CASE BUT HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP IT 

4040
02:12:38,984 --> 02:12:39,184
YOU. 

4041
02:12:39,184 --> 02:12:41,286
>>  LET'S DO THAT BECAUSE I'M 

4042
02:12:41,286 --> 02:12:42,087
OUT OF TIME. 

4043
02:12:42,087 --> 02:12:42,387
THANK YOU. 

4044
02:12:42,387 --> 02:12:45,223
>>  CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 

4045
02:12:45,223 --> 02:12:47,492

4048

MINUTES.

JOINING US TODAY. 

4052
02:12:54,699 --> 02:12:57,002
I WANT TO START BY SAYING I 

4053
02:12:57,002 --> 02:12:58,770
THINK TWITTER IS AN IMPORTANT 

4054
02:12:58,770 --> 02:13:00,772
TOOL IN MODERN COMMUNICATIO 

4055
02:13:00,772 --> 02:13:02,641
AND IT'S WHY BACK IN 2011 I WAS 

4056
02:13:02,641 --> 02:13:03,575
SPEARHEADING AN EFFORT TO GET 

4057
02:13:03,575 --> 02:13:05,644
OUR MEMBERS SIGNED UP AND USING 

4058
02:13:05,644 --> 02:13:05,944
THIS TOOL. 

4059
02:13:05,944 --> 02:13:08,080
I THINK THAT IT'S A GREAT WAY 

4060
02:13:08,080 --> 02:13:10,615
TO INTERACT WITH THE PEOPLE WE 

4061
02:13:10,615 --> 02:13:11,783
REPRESENT AND SINCE THEN ITS 

4062
02:13:11,783 --> 02:13:13,218
BEEN AMAZING TO SEE THE GROWTH 

4063
02:13:13,218 --> 02:13:15,520
OF TWITTER AND THE TWITTER 

4064
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:16,788
USERS ALL ACROSS AMERICA AND 

4065
02:13:16,788 --> 02:13:17,322
THE WORLD. 

4066
02:13:17,322 --> 02:13:18,990
IT'S WHY I THINK THIS HEARING 

4067
02:13:18,990 --> 02:13:19,491
IS SO TIMELY. 

4068
02:13:19,491 --> 02:13:21,893
THERE'S A LOT OF SERIOUS 

4069
02:13:21,893 --> 02:13:23,695
QUESTIONS THAT AMERICANS HAVE 

4070
02:13:23,695 --> 02:13:24,830
REGARDING TECH PLATFORMS AND 

4071
02:13:24,830 --> 02:13:26,798
THE ONES THEY ARE USING EVERY 

4072
02:13:26,798 --> 00:00:00,000
DAY AND THE ISSUES LIKE DATA
