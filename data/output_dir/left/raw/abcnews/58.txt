POLICE.

13
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:33,793
THEY HAVE A SUSPECT IN CUSTODY.

14
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,229
IT APPEARS THIS APPEARS TO BE AN

15
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,897
INTENTIONAL DRIVING DOWN OF THAT

16
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:38,565
BIKE PATH.

17
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,900
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS 

18
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,101
PRECIPITATED BY ROAD RAGE.

19
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,136

AUTHORITIES SAY THE TRUCK 

28
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,049
TRAVELED SOME 20 BLOCKS, MOWING 

29
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,917
DOWN A BICYCLIST AND HITTING 

30
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,419
SCHOOL BUS AS YOU REPORTED.

31
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,121
THIS IS ONE OF 10 OR 12 RECENT 

32
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,289
INCIDENTS IN WHICH VEHICLES HAVE

33
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,424
BEEN USED TO ATTACK.

34
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:08,860
>> AND WE KNOW THAT THIS HAS 

35
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,496
BEEN SOMETHING THAT ISIS HAS 

36
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:15,602
CALLED ON THEIR FOLLOWERS TO DO.

37
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:16,202
WITH NO INFORMATION, WHETHER 

38
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:16,836
THIS WAS INSPIRED BY ISIS OR 

39
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:17,237
SOMETHING ELSE.

40
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,872
>> THE FBI IS RESPONDING TO THE 

41
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:20,673
SCENE, SUGGESTING THERE IS MORE 

42
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:21,774
TO IT THAN ROAD RAGE. 

43
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,844
>> LET'S GO TO PIERRE THOMAS.

44
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,112
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN 

45
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:26,345

46
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:29,649
>> WELL, THEY HAVE GOTTEN SOME 

47
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,683
PRELIMINARY INFORMATION, GEORGE.

48
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,018
SOME OF THE PRELIMINARY 

49
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:32,618
INFORMATION POINTED TO ROAD 

50
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:32,852
RAGE.

51
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,487
BUT NOW I'M BEING TOLD BY A 

52
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,789
SOURCE THAT THEY'RE REASSESSING,

53
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:37,757
TRYING TO GET ADDITIONAL 

54
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,859

55
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:40,493
INJURED AND DEAD.

56
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,295
AND REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT 

57
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:45,098
WHAT PRECIPITATED THIS EVENT.

58
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,967
BUT THE SOURCE I JUST TALKED TO 

59
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,201
SAID THAT GIVEN THE LENGTH OF 

60
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,937
TIME THAT THE TRUCK WAS ON THE 

61
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,404
BIKE TRAIL, THAT THIS ACT AT 

62
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:54,173
LEAST IN PART IS INTENTIONAL.

63
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,975
BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE REASON 

64
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:56,175
YET. 

65
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,510
>> MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO OF NEW

SO IS GOVERNOR CUOMO.

POLICE HAVE GOT THE STREET 

74
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,463
BLOCKED OFF.

75
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,965
WE'RE ABOUT TWO BLOCKS FROM 

76
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:19,698
WHERE THE INCIDENT HAPPENED.

77
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:21,167

86
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,114

00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,248
APPEARED TO BE SOMETHING IN HIS 

88
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:36,649
HAND.

89
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,885
IT APPEARED TO BE A GUN.

90
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,088
THAT IS ALL THE INFORMATION WE 

91
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:42,288

ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, THEY'RE

98
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,634
SAYING HE WAS DISPLAYING A GUN.

99
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,235
BUT THEY'RE DESCRIBING IT AS AN

00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:56,602
IMITATION GUN. 

101
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:58,471
>> NOT AN OPERABLE GUN.

102
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,840

WHAT YOU SEE THERE IS STUYVESANT

115

00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:19,698
TRUCK WHICH WAS RENTED FROM HOME

189
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:19,898
DEPOT.

190
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,399
AND THERE YOU SEE HIM COMING OUT

191
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,033
OF THE TRUCK, BEING CHASED DOWN 

192
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,503
BY POLICE.

193
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,104
TURNED OUT HE DID NOT HAVE A 

194
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:26,738
GUN.

195
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,839
IT WAS AN IMITATION GUN.

196
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,441
BUT THIS IS NOW BEING TREATED AS

197
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,241
AN ACT OF TERRORISM.

198
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:32,911
I'M HERE WITH OUR CHIEF 

199
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,679
INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT, 

200
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:35,480
BRIAN ROSS.

201
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,948
7 DEAD, 15 INJURED RIGHT NOW.

202
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:38,650
THIS IS A PATTERN WE HAVE SEEN 

203
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:38,883
BEFORE. 

204
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:39,250
>> ABSOLUTELY.

205
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,218
FBI ON THE SCENE.

206
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,254
CONSIDER THIS AN INTENTIONAL 

207
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:42,420
ACT.

208
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,788
HE DROVE AT LEAST TEN BLOCKS 

209
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:45,457
DOWN THIS BIKE PATH, CROWDED AT 

210
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,424
THAT TIME OF THE DAY.

211
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,826
AND AS YOU SAID, GEORGE, THIS 

212
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:48,859
HAS HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN, 

213
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:50,795
GOING BACK JUST TWO YEARS.

214
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:54,032
TEN SEPARATE INCIDENTS FROM NICE

215
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:57,168
TO COPENHAGEN TO BERLIN TO 

216
00:23:57,168 --> 00:23:57,535
CHARLOTTESVILLE.

217
00:23:57,535 --> 00:23:59,270
THIS IS HAS BECOME A WAY 

218
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,005
TERRORISTS CARRY OUT ATTACKS. 

219
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:02,607
>> PIERRE THOMAS IS ALSO WITH 

220
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:02,773
US.

221
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:04,075
AND PIERRE, THE INITIAL REPORTS 

222
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,544
SEEM TO INDICATE THIS MIGHT BE 

223
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,145
AN INCIDENT OF ROAD RAGE THAT IS

224
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,580
NOT THE CASE RIGHT NOW.

225
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,315
FEDERAL OFFICIALS ARE ALL OVER 

226
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:10,549
IT.

227
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,416
>> INDEED.

228
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:15,420
THOSE WERE SOME OF THE INITIAL 

229
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,621
REPORTS BUT OBVIOUSLY LAW 

230
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,255
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AT THE 

231
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,456
FEDERAL LEVEL HAVE BEEN PRESSING

232
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,324
FOR MORE DETAILS.

233
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,092
I CAN TELL YOU, AGAIN, FROM MY 

234
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,160
SOURCES THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT 

235
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,595
THIS AS A POSSIBLE ACT OF 

236
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:24,029
TERROR.

237
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,664
THAT'S THE WAY IT'S BEEN PHRASED

238
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,032
TO ME.

239
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,366
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE 

240
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,534
GETTING BRIEFINGS HERE IN 

241
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:29,834
WASHINGTON.

242
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:30,835
I'M BEING TOLD THAT THE FBI 

243
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:32,804
DIRECTOR HAS BEEN BRIEFED AND 

244
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,939
HAS ALSO BEEN IN CONTACT WITH 

245
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:36,041
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF 

246
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:36,308
SESSIONS.

247
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,543
SO THIS IS GETTING THE HIGHEST 

248
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,744
LEVEL ATTENTION -- ATTENTION 

249
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:40,978
FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF 

250
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:41,279
GOVERNMENT. 

251
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,548
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 

252
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:44,849
BRIEFED AS WELL.

253
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:46,685
TO LINZIE JANIS ON THE SCENE.

254
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:47,619
THAT ENTIRE AREA IS ON LOCKDOWN,

255
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:52,157
SWARMING WITH POLICE.

256
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,425
>> THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE.

257
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,027
AND JUST MOMENTS AGO, WE SAW THE

258
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,095
FBI EVIDENCE RESPONSE TEAM PULL 

259
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,464

260
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:00,832

261
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,567
THE FBI EVIDENCE RESPONSE TEAM, 

262
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,036
A COUPLE OF MEMBERS OF THE 

263
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,271
EVIDENCE RESPONSE TEAM HEADED 

264
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:06,838
TOWARDS THE SCENE.

265
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,006
POLICE ARE CRAWLING ALL OVER 

266
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:08,373
THIS AREA.

267
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:10,742
THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF 

268
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:11,843
BYSTANDERS JUST STANDING HERE ON

269
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,880
THE STREET CORNER, LOOKS OF 

270
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,748
DISBELIEF ON THEIR FACE.

271
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,450
PEOPLE WERE OUT WITH THEIR 

272
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,150
CHILDREN, TRICK OR TREATING.

273
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,852
SCHOOL WAS JUST LETTING OUT 

274
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,886
ACROSS MANHATTAN AS THIS 

275
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:22,821
INCIDENT UNFOLDED.

276
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,522
AND WE RECEIVED A VIDEO FROM ONE

277
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,758
OF THESE BYSTANDERS.

278
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,593
A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD BEEN WALKING

279
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:29,961
ACROSS THE PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY 

280
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,864
ACROSS THE TOP OF THE HIGHWAY.

281
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,599
HE HAD A CLEAR VIEW OF THIS 

282
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,733
INCIDENT UNFOLDING.

283
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:38,503
HE WAS A STUDENT JUST NORTH OF 

284
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,305
CHAMBERS STREET WHERE I AM HERE.

285
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,674
AND HE SHOWED US THAT VIDEO OF 

286
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:43,541
THE PERPETRATOR SORT OF STANDING

287
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,843
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET, NOT

288
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,177
SURE WHICH WAY TO GO, HOLDING 

289
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,179
THAT OBJECT THAT LOOKED LIKE A 

290
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:48,345
GUN.

291
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:50,081
WE NOW HEAR SOME SORT OF FAKE 

292
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:50,281
GUN. 

293
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:51,416
>> THAT'S RIGHT, LINZIE.

294
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,383

WE'RE WATCHING THAT VIDEO RIGHT 

298
00:25:57,922 --> 00:25:58,289
NOW.

299
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:00,659
WE SEE THE GUNMAN RUNNING 

300
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,059
THROUGH THE STREET, SURROUNDED 

301
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:03,261
BY TAXIS.

302
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,696
TELL WHAT'S YOU WERE SEEING, 

303
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:05,296
WHAT YOU WERE THINKING AT THE 

304
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:11,102
TIME.

305
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:15,040
>> I WAS ACTUALLY WALKING.

306
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,445
AND I -- 

307
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,546
>> I THINK WE LOST THIBAULT 

308
00:26:22,546 --> 00:26:22,914
RIGHT THERE.

309
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,982
WE HAVE TO GET A BETTER PHONE 

310
00:26:24,982 --> 00:26:26,151
CONNECTION AND COME BACK TO HIM.

311
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,453
BUT GIO BENITEZ ON THE SCENE.

312
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:29,654
>> GEORGE, HEY THERE.

313
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:30,922
SO RIGHT HERE, WHAT WE'RE SEEING

314
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,691
IS THAT THIS ROAD HAS BEEN 

315
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:33,191
COMPLETELY BLOCKED OFF.

316
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,759
AND WE KNOW THAT THIS HAPPENED 

317
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,994
ABOUT TWO BLOCKS FROM HERE.

318
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:37,729
BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS MORE 

319
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,330
POLICE, MORE POLICE, JUST 

320
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:39,563
COMING.

321
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:40,698
WE'VE SEEN AMBULANCES COME 

322
00:26:40,698 --> 00:26:41,499
THROUGH HERE.

323
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,668
AND WE'RE JUST SEEING A MASSIVE 

324
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:44,636
POLICE PRESENCE.

325
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,004
CLEARLY, THEY'RE TRYING TO GET A

326
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,238
HANDLE OF IT TOO.

327
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:48,473
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS WE'RE 

328
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,874
SEEING MAJOR TRAFFIC ON THIS 

329
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:50,108
STREET.

330
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,210
BUT RIGHT NOW, GEORGE, WE HAVE 

331
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,314
THIS MAJOR, MAJOR ROAD HERE IN

00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,382
DOWNTOWN NEW YORK, DOWNTOWN 

333
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,016
MANHATTAN, COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN 

334
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:58,516
AT THIS POINT.

335
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:00,285
>> COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN.

336
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:00,952
STUYVESANT HIGH SCHOOL HAD BEEN 

337
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,320
ON LOCKDOWN.

338
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,488
AND GIO, THERE HAD ALSO BEEN A 

339
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,757
REPORT THAT SOME OF THE INJURED,

340
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:06,991
YOUNG STUDENTS, SPECIAL NEEDS 

341
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:07,959
STUDENTS IN A SCHOOL BUS WHO 

342
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:11,062
WERE HIT BY THAT PICKUP TRUCK.

343
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,864
>> AND WE HAVE BEEN SEEING SO 

344
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,632
MANY SCHOOL BUSES, GEORGE, COME 

345
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:14,965
THROUGH HERE.

346
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:17,168
SO CLEARLY THIS IS A STREET THAT

347
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,670
MANY SCHOOL BUSES TYPICALLY GO 

348
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:18,903
THROUGH.

349
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:19,937
IT'S THE WEST SIDE HIGHWAY.

350
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:21,105
AND FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW NEW

351
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:22,440
YORK CITY, THE WEST SIDE HIGHWAY

352
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,143
IS JUST ONE OF THE BIGGEST 

353
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,310
THOROUGHFARES IN NEW YORK WHERE 

354
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,280
SO MANY CARS JUST GO ALL ALONG 

355
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,782
LITERALLY THE WEST SIDE OF NEW 

356
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:31,249
YORK CITY.

357
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,818
AND THAT IS WHERE YOU WOULD FIND

358
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,019
SCHOOL BUSES, YOU WOULD FIND 

359
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:37,155
PEOPLE LEAVING FROM WORK.

360
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,857
YOU WOULD FIND SO MANY BIKERS 

361
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:39,924
THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A 

362
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,794
MASSIVE BIKE LANE THERE TO USE.

363
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,328
AND SO THAT IS WHAT IS USED 

364
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:45,630
RIGHT NOW IN NEW YORK CITY.

365
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,064
AND THAT'S WHAT IS SHUT DOWN AT 

366
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:47,999
THIS POINT.

367
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,334
I'M TRYING TO SEE IF WE CAN SEE 

368
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,202
BEYOND IT.

369
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:52,504
BUT JUST SO MANY POLICE THERE.

370
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,304
>> OKAY.

371
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,039
TRY AND FIND OUT SOME MORE.

372
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,374
WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK 

373
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,510
THIBAULT ROY, THE STUDENT WHO 

374
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:58,877
SHOT THE VIDEO.

375
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:04,582
CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

376
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:05,082
THIBAULT, ARE YOU THERE?

377
00:28:05,082 --> 00:28:05,382
>> HELLO?

378
00:28:05,382 --> 00:28:06,484
>> HI, THIBAULT.

379
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:07,852
IT'S GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS.

380
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,953
CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

381
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,588
TELL US ABOUT THAT VIDEO YOU 

382
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:11,355
WERE SHOOTING.

383
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:12,256
I THINK WE HAVE A BETTER 

384
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:12,656
CONNECTION NOW. 

385
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:14,225
>> AS I SAID BEFORE, THIS ISN'T 

386
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:14,692
MY VIDEO.

387
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:15,860
I GOT IT FROM A FRIEND.

388
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,563
BUT I SAW THE SHOOTER COME 

389
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,198
OUTSIDE OF HIS CAR.

390
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,699
AND I SAW HIM EXIT AND RUN 

391
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,767
TOWARDS A GROUP OF KIDS.

392
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,435
AND THEN I WENT BACK INTO MY 

393
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:24,869
SCHOOL.

394
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,638
>> THE POLICE HAVE SAID HE WAS 

395
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,273
WAVING SOME SORT OF AN IMITATION

396
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:28,473
GUN.

397
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:28,873
DID YOU SEE THAT?

398
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,844
WE SEE IT NOW IN THE VIDEO.

399
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:33,377
>> THEY LOOKED REAL TO ME.

400
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:34,845
BUT HE WAS WAVING THEM AROUND.

401
00:28:34,845 --> 00:28:36,247
I DID SEE THAT.

402
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,648
AND HE SPRINTED TOWARDS A GROUP 

403
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:38,550
OF KIDS.

404
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,284
>> TOWARDS THE GROUP OF KIDS?

405
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:42,353
>> THAT'S WHAT I SAW, YEAH.

406
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:43,822
>> AND ABOUT HOW LONG DID THIS 

407
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:44,389
TAKE PLACE?

408
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,990
HOW LONG WERE YOU WATCHING HIM 

409
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,156
FOR?

410
00:28:46,156 --> 00:28:49,060
>> I WAS WATCHING HIM FOR ABOUT 

411
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,695
MAYBE 20 SECONDS BEFORE I -- I 

412
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,097
HAD TO JUST RUN BACK JUST FOR MY

413
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:53,631
OWN SAFETY. 

414
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:54,065
>> RIGHT.

415
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,767
AND YOU SAY THEY LOOKED REAL.

416
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:57,735
BUT COULD YOU TELL?

417
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:59,737
COULD YOU HEAR IF ANY KIND OF 

418
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:00,871
ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION WERE COMING

419
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:02,406
OUT OF HIS GUN, OR YOU COULDN'T 

420
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:02,807
TELL?

421
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,809
>> I DID NOT HEAR ANY SHOTS AND 

422
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,577
I DIDN'T SEE HIM FIRE AT 

423
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:06,811
ANYBODY.

424
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,847
>> WAS HE SAYING ANYTHING?

425
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:12,851
>> HE DID NOT.

426
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,019
THAT I COULD HEAR.

427
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,687
>> WHEN YOU WENT BACK INSIDE 

428
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:18,556
BEFORE HE WAS APPREHENDED BY THE

429
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,658
POLICE?

430
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:20,991
>> YES, I WAS.

431
00:29:20,991 --> 00:29:21,926
>> WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT 

432
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,461
WHO SHOT THE VIDEO AND WHERE YOU

433
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:24,796
WERE ABLE TO GET IT?

434
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,430
>> I GOT IT FROM A FRIEND WHO 

435
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,933
WAS WALKING ON THE BRIDGE 

436
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,969
FARTHER DOWN FROM WHERE I WAS.

437
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,837
AND FROM WHAT I CAN TELL, THEY 

438
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,672
JUST SPRINTED FROM THAT TOWARD 

439
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:37,175
THE END OF THE BRIDGE AND JUST 

440
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:37,976
LEFT THE VICINITY.

441
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,944
>> THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A 

442
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,045
TERRIFYING 20 SECONDS.

443
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,914
>> IT WAS PRETTY SCARY, YEAH.

444
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,184
BUT WE'RE ALL SAFE NOW.

445
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,219
>> WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE OKAY NOW.

446
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,754
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT STORY

447
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:53,124
AND THIS VIDEO WITH US.

448
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,126
BRIAN ROSS HERE AS WELL.

449
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,795
NEW YORK IS ALWAYS ON HIGH ALERT

450
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:58,195
IN NEW YORK CITY. 

451
00:29:58,195 --> 00:29:58,830
>> ABSOLUTELY.

452
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,198
>> WE HAVEN'T HAD AN INCIDENT 

453
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,165
QUITE LIKE THIS. 

454
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:02,066
>> THEY'VE TAKEN STEPS TO BLOCK 

455
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,101
OFF ACCESS TO PEDESTRIAN 

456
00:30:04,101 --> 00:30:05,270
WALKWAYS IN TIMES SQUARE AND 

457
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,871
MAJOR CENTERS, BUT NOT THIS BIKE

458
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:07,372
PATH.

459
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:08,840
THEY'RE ALWAYS ON GUARD, 

460
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,107
OBVIOUSLY.

461
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:09,974
IN THIS CASE, THOUGH, GEORGE, 

462
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,342
WITH A SUSPECT IN CUSTODY, HE 

463
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,845
WAS SHOT, BUT IS DESCRIBED AS 

464
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:14,212
ALIVE.

465
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,346
WITH A SUSPECT IN CUSTODY, 

466
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,580
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO QUICKLY 

467
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,048
DETERMINE WHO HE IS AND WHAT HIS

468
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:20,585
BACKGROUND IS, WHAT KIND OF 

469
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:21,853
ELECTRONIC SOCIAL MEDIA HE MAY 

470
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:22,053
HAVE. 

471
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,321
>> WHETHER HE WAS ACTING ALONE?

472
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,856
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

473
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:30,328
>> LET'S GO TO JON KARL AT THE 

474
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:30,762
WHITE HOUSE. 

475
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,164
>> HE HAS BEEN BRIEFED BY JOHN 

476
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,133
KELLY AND WE'RE TOLD HE'LL BE 

477
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,500
KEPT UP TO DATE AS FURTHER 

478
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,669
DEVELOPMENTS COME OUT.

479
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,369
ALSO, THE FIRST LADY HAS TWEETED

480
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,571
HER RESPONSE TO THIS SAYING "MY 

481
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:41,238
HEARTBREAKS FOR NEW YORK CITY 

482
00:30:41,238 --> 00:30:41,739
TODAY.

483
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:44,075
HEARTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH THE 

484
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:44,342
VICTIMS."

485
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,910
OF COURSE, GEORGE, THIS IS AN 

486
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,511
ATTACK THAT IS IN THE 

487
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:48,946
PRESIDENT'S HOMETOWN, SOMETHING 

488
00:30:48,946 --> 00:30:51,082
THAT HITS PARTICULARLY CLOSE TO 

489
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,717
HOME FOR THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 

490
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:52,950
FAMILY. 

491
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,252
>> VERY CLOSE TO HOME.

492
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,486
AND A VERY HARD HIT.

493
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:58,656
AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING, 7 DEAD, 15

494
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:00,925
INJURED AFTER AN INCIDENT THAT 

495
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,293
UNFOLDED AT APPROXIMATELY 3:00 

496
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:03,628
P.M. HERE IN NEW YORK CITY LOWER

497
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,962
MANHATTAN AT 3:00 P.M. WHEN A 

498
00:31:04,962 --> 00:31:06,831
MAN DRIVING A RENTED WHITE 

499
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:07,999
PICKUP TRUCK FROM HOME DEPOT 

500
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,466
TURNED ON TO THAT BIKE PATH YOU 

501
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:10,667
SEE RIGHT THERE WITH THAT TRUCK 

502
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:12,770
AND STARTED TO MOW DOWN 

503
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,271
PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS.

504
00:31:14,271 --> 00:31:15,907
ALSO HITTING A SCHOOL BUS 

505
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,209
CARRYING SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN.

506
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,845
THIS IS NOW BEING TREATED AS AN 

507
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,947
ACT OF TERRORISM.

508
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,016
LINZIE JANIS IS ON THE SCENE.

509
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,919
EVERYONE DOWN THERE NOW, LINZIE 

510
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,519
PREPARING FOR A BRIEFING FROM 

511
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,187
THE GOVERNOR AND THE MAYOR IN 

512
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,823
THE NEXT HALF HOUR OR SO?

513
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:32,824
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

514
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:33,791
WE'RE BEING TOLD WE WILL HEAR 

515
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:36,427
FROM THEM AT ABOUT 5:15 EASTERN.

516
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:37,595
RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEING MORE 

517
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,664
POLICE VEHICLES COMING THROUGH 

518
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:40,898
TOWARDS THE SCENE OF THE CRIME 

519
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:41,599
HERE.

520
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,634
WE DID SEE THE FBI EVIDENCE 

521
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:45,069
RESPONSE TEAM HEADED THAT WAY 

522
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,672
JUST A FEW MOMENTS OKAY.

523
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:48,939
WE KNOW THIS IS NOW BEING 

524
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:50,675
TREATED AS AN ACT OF TERROR.

525
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,675
BUT JUST TO TELL YOU A LITTLE 

526
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:53,177
BIT MORE ABOUT THAT BIKE PATH 

527
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:56,714
THAT RUNS ALONG THE WEST SIDE 

528
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:56,947
HIGHWAY.

529
00:31:56,947 --> 00:31:59,317
AFTER THREE3:00 THIS AFTERNOON, 

530
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,852
WOULD HAVE BEEN PACKED.

531
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,587
JOGGER, BIKERS, PEOPLE WALKING.

532
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,654
THIS IS AROUND THE TIME JUST 

533
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:05,323
AFTER 3:00 P.M. THAT SCHOOLS 

534
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,224
START GETTING OUT.

535
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,358
IT'S HALLOWEEN.

536
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,659
PARENTS GETTING OFF WORK EARLY 

537
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:10,862
TO GATHER THEIR KIDS AND TO TAKE

538
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:11,362
THEM TRICK OR TREATING.

539
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,131
I'M STANDING ON A CORNER HERE OF

540
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:17,201
A MAJOR STREET, CHAMBERS HERE IN

541
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:18,669
DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN AND TRIBECA.

542
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:20,471
THERE ARE PEOPLE ALL OVER JUST 

543
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,939
STANDING HERE WITH LOOKS OF 

544
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,307
DISBELIEF ON THEIR FACES.

545
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:24,208
THIS HAS HAPPENED HERE IN 

546
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:24,842
MANHATTAN NOW.

547
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:26,477
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING IT WAS 

548
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:27,378
ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

549
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:30,381
IT APPEARS THAT A TERROR HAS 

550
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,382
STRUCK HERE ONCE AGAIN IN THE 

551
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,650
HEART OF MANHATTAN.

552
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,986
>> THAT'S RIGHT, LINZIE.

553
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,487
AND LINZIE, THAT NEIGHBORHOOD 

554
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,489
NOT ALL THAT FAR FROM GROUND 

555
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:39,056
ZERO, THE SITE OF THE 9/11 

556
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:41,092
ATTACKS.

557
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,093
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

558
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,595
WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO THE 9/11 

559
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:48,833
SPOT, TO THE MEMORIAL MUSEUM 

560
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,033
THERE.

561
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,935
AND NEIGHBORHOOD VERY, VERY, 

562
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:51,669
VERY BUSY.

563
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,370
DOWNTOWN IS KIND OF WHERE IT'S 

564
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,272
AT ON HALLOWEEN.

565
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,038
THE VILLAGE NOT TOO FAR FROM 

566
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:57,442
HERE IS WHERE THE BIG PARADE IS.

567
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,176
CERTAINLY THE AREA WHERE THIS 

568
00:32:59,176 --> 00:33:01,345
PERSON STRUCK WOULD HAVE BEEN A 

569
00:33:01,345 --> 00:33:02,547
VERY, VERY BUSY AREA.

570
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,682
THE WEST SIDE HIGHWAY, THAT BIKE

571
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:05,783
PATH, THAT BIKE PATH THERE.

572
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,351
AND AS YOU MENTIONED, SCHOOLS 

573
00:33:07,351 --> 00:33:08,419
LETTING OUT AS WELL.

574
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,221
>> OKAY, LINZIE JANIS, THANKS 

575
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:10,554
VERY MUCH.

576
00:33:10,554 --> 00:33:12,690
I'M JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY THE 

577
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,658
FORMER CHIEF OF POLICE OF NEW 

578
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,459
YORK CITY, RAY KELLY.

579
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,460
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING YOU 

580
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,461
PREPARED FOR YEAR AFTER YEAR 

581
00:33:17,461 --> 00:33:19,697
AFTER YEAR, AND NOW IT'S 

582
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:19,964
HAPPENED.

583
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:20,465
>> RIGHT.

584
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:21,732
OBVIOUSLY IT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY

585
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:23,701
EASIER THERE ARE A LOT OF POLICE

586
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:26,170
IN THAT GENERAL AREA, BUT NOT 

587
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:26,670
SPECIFICALLY WHERE THIS 

588
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,072
INDIVIDUAL WENT ON TO THE BIKE 

589
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:28,272
PATH.

590
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,306
AND HE HAD AT LEAST A FOUR-BLOCK

591
00:33:29,306 --> 00:33:31,342
RUN.

592
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,344
AND AT 3:00 IN THE AFTERNOON, 

593
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,412
THAT BIKE PATH, WHICH IS VERY 

594
00:33:35,412 --> 00:33:38,082
WIDE BIKE PATH IS VERY BUSY WITH

595
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,852
JOGGERS AND BIKERS.

596
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,220
SO CLEARLY INTENTIONAL.

597
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,555
AN EFFORT TO KILL PEOPLE.

598
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:48,059
WE KNOW THAT THE SEVEN DEAD SO 

599
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:48,259
FAR.

600
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,294
THIS INDIVIDUAL MADE STATEMENTS.

601
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:53,931
HE MADE A STATEMENT ALLAHU 

602
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:54,131
AKBAR.

603
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:55,766
>> DO WE KNOW HE SAID THAT?

604
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:58,469
>> IT'S REPORTED BY WITNESSES. 

605
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,036
>> THIS IS WHAT POLICE ARE 

606
00:33:59,036 --> 00:33:59,770
FINDING OUT RIGHT NOW. 

607
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:00,671
>> THIS IS WHAT POLICE ARE 

608
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:00,971
FINDING OUT.

609
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:02,140
THIS IS A STATEMENT.

610
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,073
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A LOT OF 

611
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:03,774
POTENTIAL WITNESSES.

612
00:34:03,774 --> 00:34:06,143
SO THE GATHERING PEOPLE, 

613
00:34:06,143 --> 00:34:06,443
QUESTIONING.

614
00:34:06,443 --> 00:34:07,912
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME.

615
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,947
BUT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TOLD.

616
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,514
I'M NOT CERTAIN IF IN FACT HE 

617
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:13,518
HAD A WEAPON OR REPORTED THAT 

618
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,154
HAD A WEAPON THAT DIDN'T WORK.

619
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,955
BUT THE ONLY SHOT THAT WERE 

620
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,422
FIRED APPEARED TO BE FROM THE 

621
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:20,424
POLICE TO STOP IT. 

622
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:21,859
>> AND THEY DID INJURE THE 

623
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:22,560
DRIVER?

624
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,960
>> HE WAS STRUCK IN THE 

625
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,362
BUTTOCKS, AND HE IS IN CUSTODY 

626
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:25,830
NOW.

627
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,330
HE SAY LIVE. 

628
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,833
>> WOULD THEY ALREADY BE TALKING

629
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:29,065
TO HIM?

630
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:30,735
>> NO.

631
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,270
IT PROBABLY WOULD BE WAY TOO 

632
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,404
EARLY TO TALK TO HIM, UNLESS 

633
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,806
THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATE THREAT.

634
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:38,141
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY DOING A LOT OF

635
00:34:38,141 --> 00:34:40,844
BACKGROUND EXAMINATION OF HIM.

636
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:44,849
WE'RE THEOLD THAT HE MAY BE OF 

637
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:45,716
BOSNIAN ORIGIN.

638
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,717
THEY'RE CHECKING -- CERTAINLY 

639
00:34:47,717 --> 00:34:50,353
THE FBI IS TALKING TO PEOPLE AND

640
00:34:50,353 --> 00:34:51,289
INTERPOL, ORGANIZATIONS LIKE 

641
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:51,489
THAT.

642
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,656
FIND OUT ANY BIT OF INFORMATION 

643
00:34:52,656 --> 00:34:54,759
THAT CAN GIVE THEM A BETTER FEEL

644
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,993
IN THIS INVESTIGATION. 

645
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,361
>> AND OBVIOUSLY TRY TO FIGURE 

646
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,596
FOUGHT THERE IS ANY KIND OF 

647
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,098
COORDINATION WITH ANYONE ELSE, 

648
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:03,501
ANY POSSIBILITY OF A FOLLOW-ON 

649
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:03,734
ATTACK. 

650
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:04,135
>> EXACTLY WHERE.

651
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,070
DID HE LIVE, AND HIS PHONE IS 

652
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,572
ALWAYS SIGNIFICANT.

653
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,208
ANY CRIMINAL RECORD, ALL OF 

654
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,808
THESE THINGS.

655
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,376
I'M SURE HAVE BEEN CHECKED 

656
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,543
ALREADY OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

657
00:35:13,543 --> 00:35:15,813
DOING A DEEP DIVE ON THIS 

658
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:16,180
INDIVIDUAL.

659
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,149
>> JOINED ON THE PHONE NOW BY 

660
00:35:19,149 --> 00:35:20,284
COUNTER TERROR EXPERT RICHARD 

661
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:20,517
CLARKE.

662
00:35:20,517 --> 00:35:22,019
OF COURSE WORKED IN THE WHITE 

663
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,454
HOUSE FOR MANY YEARS.

664
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,689
RICHARD, THIS IS BECOMING SUCH A

665
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:25,890
PATTERN WE'RE SEE RIGHT NOW.

666
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,791
NO SIGNS YET THAT HE WAS WORKING

667
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:28,859
WITH ANYONE ELSE.

668
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:31,696
BUT STILL VERY DEADLY.

669
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:35,566
>> GEORGE, THE TEST 

670
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:43,274
>> TOWARDS THE PATTERN WE'RE 

671
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,074
SEEING

672
00:35:44,074 --> 00:35:44,708
SEEING, BOTH THE UNITED STATES 

673
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:45,376
AND EUROPE AND INDIVIDUALS GO 

674
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:46,310
OUT AND GET A TRUCK.

675
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,945
THE POLICE IN THE UNITED STATES 

676
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,447
AND EUROPE KNOW THIS IS A 

677
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:50,747
POSSIBILITY.

678
00:35:50,747 --> 00:35:52,449
THEY'VE BEEN GOING AROUND TO 

679
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:54,184
SPECIAL EVENTS AND BLOCKING 

680
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:56,854
TRAILER TRUCKS AND DUMP TRUCKS.

681
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,489
YOU CAN'T DO THAT EVERYWHERE.

682
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,625
THIS TECHNIQUE IS WELL-KNOWN NOW

683
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:04,328
AROUND THE WORLD.

684
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,797
POTENTIAL TERRORISTS KNOW IT 

685
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:06,997
WORKS.

686
00:36:06,997 --> 00:36:10,567
>> WE'VE SEEN IT IN NICE, 

687
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:15,473
BARCELONA AND LONDON AND 

688
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:15,706
GERMANY.

689
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:18,709
>> IT'S NO ACCIDENT THE REACTION

690
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,778
COMES AS WE SEE THE MAN RIGHT 

691
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,379
THERE DRIVING THE PICKUP TRUCK, 

692
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:24,314
AS ISIS IS TAKING MORE DEFEATS 

693
00:36:24,314 --> 00:36:27,184
ON THE BATTLEFIELD IN IRAQ AND 

694
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:27,518
SYRIA.

695
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:31,155
>> WE HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATING AND

696
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,157
BEEN SAYING, WITH ISIS LOSING 

697
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,625
CONTROL OF THE MAJOR CITIES, 

698
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,927
THEY STILL HAVE THOUSANDS, TENS 

699
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:40,831
OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

700
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:41,765
THEY WILL CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE.

701
00:36:41,765 --> 00:36:44,267
ISIS IS NOT DEAD.

702
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:46,704
THE FACT IT CAN CREATE PEOPLE 

703
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,505
SPONTANEOUSLY BECOMING MEMBERS 

704
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,974
OF ISIS AND WITHIN HOURS OF THAT

705
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,041
DECISION, GOING OUT AND KILLING 

706
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,743
PEOPLE HERE IN OUR COUNTRY AND 

707
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,411
ALL OVER EUROPE, ISIS WILL BE A 

708
00:36:54,411 --> 00:37:00,784
FORCE FOR A WHILE. 

709
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:02,987
>> DESCRIBE HOW THOSE MESSAGES 

710
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:03,354
GET OUT.

711
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,923
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF ISIS AND 

712
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:08,826
AL QAEDA RELATED WEBSITES, VERY 

713
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,060
PERSUASIVE TO A CERTAIN KIND OF 

714
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,428
INDIVIDUAL.

715
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,363
THEY'RE IN MANY DIFFERENT 

716
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:23,674
LANGUAGES, NOT JUST ARABIC.

717
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:24,675
>> THANKS, RICK.

718
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:28,112
I WANT TO BRING IN ANOTHER 

719
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:28,545
EYEWITNESS, DIMITRI.

720
00:37:28,545 --> 00:37:32,817
TELL US WHAT YOU SAW.

721
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,485
DIMITRI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

722
00:37:35,485 --> 00:37:37,021
IT'S GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS HERE.

723
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,790
TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW.

724
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,693
>> I WAS ON THE WESTSIDE HIGHWAY

725
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,729
READING MY E-MAIL WHEN MY UBER 

726
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,564
DRIVER SAID, LOOK, THE CAR IS 

727
00:37:47,564 --> 00:37:48,866
BASICALLY MOWING PEOPLE DOWN.

728
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,601
WHEN I LOOKED UP, I DIDN'T SEE 

729
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,505
THE CAR, IT HAD ALREADY PAST.

730
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,407
I SAW THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE LYING

731
00:37:56,407 --> 00:38:01,178
IN A PILE OF BLOOD.

732
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:06,750
FIRST, I THOUGHT IT WAS A 

733
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,951
HALLOWEEN PERFORMANCE.

734
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:11,454
I WAS LOOKING AND COULDN'T TELL 

735
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:12,323
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

736
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:13,924
I SAW THE POLICE HEADING TOWARDS

737
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,893
THE FIRE AND SHOTS FIRED.

738
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:16,861
SHOTS WERE DEFINITELY FIRED 

739
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:20,097
AFTER THOSE PEOPLE WERE MOWED 

740
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:20,297
DOWN.

741
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:22,733
>> THIS HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY.

742
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,735
>> POLICE CAME IN TWO OR THREE 

743
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,003
MINUTES, TWO MINUTES OUT THERE, 

744
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,472
WHILE I WAS THINKING, IS IT SORT

745
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:35,780
OF LIKE -- TWO MINUTES TOPS.

746
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,247
THE SHOTS WERE FIRED AND THEY 

747
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:40,418
HUNKERED DOWN.

748
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:44,555
THEN THEY STARTED WAVING TO US.

749
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:49,126
THEN, WHEN WE CAME THERE, I SAW 

750
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:52,396
THE CAR, RENTAL TRUCK, SOME SORT

751
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:56,867
OF LIKE THAT, ENTERPRISE, LIKE A

752
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:59,003

753
00:38:59,003 --> 00:38:59,469
DOING THINGS.

754
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:01,772
IT WAS A VERY VERY LARGE TRUCK.

755
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,107
THEN, I SAW THE SPEED BUMP ALSO 

756
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:05,409
LIKE A SMALL SPEED BUMP BADLY 

757
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,445
DAMAGED.

758
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,880
THEN, AS THEY WERE WAVING US TO 

759
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,250
QUO PAST, I SAW THE GENTLEMAN 

760
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,454
LYING DOWN, IN A PILE OF BLOOD.

761
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,689
POLICE WERE LOOKING AT HIM AND 

762
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,123
THERE WAS ANOTHER VERY FAT 

763
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:22,860
GENTLEMAN ON HIS KNEES WITH HIS 

764
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,597
HANDS IN THE AIR, STANDING ON 

765
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:27,331
THE SIDE.

766
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,066
>> I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT

767
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:29,433
ONE THING.

768
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,168
YOU'RE SAYING YOU SAW A MAN ON 

769
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,136
HIS KNEES WITH HIS HANDS UP IN 

770
00:39:33,136 --> 00:39:36,674
THE AIR SURROUNDED BY THE POLICE

771
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:37,842
AND ANOTHER MAN?

772
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:38,642
YOU DON'T KNOW?

773
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,277
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT?

774
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:43,146
>> WHETHER THAT MAN WAS PART OF 

775
00:39:43,146 --> 00:39:44,047
IT OR NOT, RIGHT?

776
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:46,450
HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE.

777
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:52,857
HE WAS WAY PAST THIS THREE 

778
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,158
TRUCKS.

779
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:55,158
HE TRIED TO RAM, ONE OF THE 

780
00:39:55,158 --> 00:39:55,493
TRUCKS.

781
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,194
I'M NOT GOING TO SPECULATE.

782
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:59,563
I CAN ONLY SAY WHAT I HAVE SEEN 

783
00:39:59,563 --> 00:39:59,863
PERSONALLY.

784
00:39:59,863 --> 00:40:03,868
>> WHAT WAS HE WEARING?

785
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:08,439
>> THE GENTLEMAN THAT WAS -- 

786
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:12,476
APPEARED TO BE VERY FAT AND IT 

787
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,278
SEEMED LIKE THE ONE WOUNDED HAD 

788
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,679
LIKE A BLACK BEARD.

789
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,280
>> OKAY.

790
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,715
THAT'S THE PERSON WE SEE RUNNING

791
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,716
AROUND BEFORE HE WAS BROUGHT 

792
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:21,185
DOWN BY POLICE IN SOMETHING LIKE

793
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,986
A DARK TRACK SUIT WITH A RED 

794
00:40:22,986 --> 00:40:24,721
STRIPE ACROSS THE BACK, IS THAT 

795
00:40:24,721 --> 00:40:25,388
WHAT YOU REMEMBER?

796
00:40:25,388 --> 00:40:27,625
>> THAT, I DIDN'T SEE BECAUSE HE

797
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:32,596
WAS ALREADY ON THE GROUND.

798
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,464
AT THE TIME.

799
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,766
>> YOU MENTIONED A SMALL SCHOOL 

800
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,334
BUS HAD BEEN HIT.

801
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,002
WE WERE TOLD THERE WERE SPECIAL 

802
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:39,770

803
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,571
COULD YOU SEE ANY PEOPLE INSIDE,

804
00:40:41,571 --> 00:40:43,073
ANY INJURIES INSIDE?

805
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:43,574
>> NO.

806
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,543
BECAUSE THE SCHOOL BUS WAS 

807
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:51,448
PROBABLY 200, 100 METERS.

808
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:53,984
I DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF THE 

809
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:56,153

810
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:56,386
HIGHWAY.

811
00:40:56,386 --> 00:40:59,423
ALL I SEE WAS IT WAS BADLY 

812
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,624
DAMAGED, FROM THE LOOKS OF IT.

813
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,593
THEY WERE WAVING US BY.

814
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:09,433
NOW, I SORT OF FEEL LIKE -- TRY 

815
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,368
TO HELP SOMEBODY.

816
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:19,510
THEY WERE WAVING THE CAR TO GO 

817
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:19,676
BY.

818
00:41:19,676 --> 00:41:22,079
AND SEE HIM SHOOTING, CRAZY.

819
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,081
>> YOU CAN'T BLAME YOURSELF FOR 

820
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:24,281
THAT.

821
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,617
CAN YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT HOW 

822
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,653

824
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:31,989
>> THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR 

825
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,291
PEOPLE LYING BY THE WESTSIDE 

826
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:34,692
HIGHWAY.

827
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,860
THERE WERE KIDS FROM THE HIGH 

828
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,396
SCHOOL THAT WERE MOWED DOWN, IN 

829
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:40,964
SOME SORT OF PERFORMANCE, SOME 

830
00:41:40,964 --> 00:41:42,899
SORT OF SHOW FOR THE HALL BEEN, 

831
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:45,336
AT FIRST, BEFORE I REALIZED WHAT

832
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,837
IS GOING ON.

833
00:41:47,837 --> 00:41:50,474
>> ALAS, IT HAS TURNED OUT NOT 

834
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:54,645
TO BE THE CASE.

835
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:55,446

IS NO ONE ELSE INVOLVED.

866
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,836
TONIGHT, WE HAVE A HALLOWEEN

00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,279
OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES DO THEY 

873
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:04,181
PUT ON THE STREET?

874
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:05,749
WILL THEY TELL PEOPLE NOT TO GO 

875
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:05,916
OUT?

876
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,117
>> NO, I DON'T THINK THAT WILL 

877
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,185
BE THE CASE.

878
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,686
YOU WILL DEFINITELY SEE MORE 

879
00:43:09,686 --> 00:43:11,221

UNSOPHISTICATED ATTACKS WHERE 

916
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:15,318
YOU SIMPLY NEED THE WILL AND A 

917
00:44:15,318 --> 00:44:19,356
VEHICLE TO RUN OVER PEOPLE.

918
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,792
THIS IS AN ONGOING CONCERN AND

THIS IS THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO 

929
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:38,142
POLICE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED 

930
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:40,310
ABOUT, GEORGE, BECAUSE THERE'S 

931
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,612
SO MANY DIFFERENT PLACES YOU CAN

932
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:42,746
SEE PEOPLE WALKING AND THEN RUN 

933
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:43,413
OVER THEM.

934
00:44:43,413 --> 00:44:44,714
IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.

935
00:44:44,714 --> 00:44:46,950
>> NONE OF THE PEOPLE ON THAT 

936
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,852
BIKE PATH WHEN THE TRUCK MADE 

937
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,822
THAT TURN -- ANDREW JOINS US 

938
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:52,189
NOW.

939
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,457
ANDREW, WHAT DID YOU SEE?

940
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,125
>> HI THERE, GEORGE.

941
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,127
I WAS WALKING ALONG THAT BIKE 

942
00:44:57,127 --> 00:45:00,097
PATH, ALONG THE HUDSON RIVER, TO

943
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:03,400
THE SOUTH, TOWARDS CHAMBERS 

944
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:03,633
STREET.

945
00:45:03,633 --> 00:45:04,834
LUCKILY FOR ME, I WAS OVER ON 

946
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:06,203
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PATH.

947
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:09,740
I HEARD A VERY LOUD NOISE, 

948
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,941
UNEXPECTED NOISE TO HEAR ON THAT

949
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:13,210
BIKE PATH OF A TRUCK DRIVING BY 

950
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,211
ME, AT A VERY HIGH SPEED.

951
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:16,713
VERY VERY RARE TO SEE ANY 

952
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:17,748
VEHICLE ON THERE, CERTAINLY 

953
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,182
DON'T SEE TRUCKS AND CERTAINLY 

954
00:45:19,182 --> 00:45:21,685
DON'T SEE TRUCKS DRIVING SO 

955
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:21,885
FAST.

956
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:26,323
POWERING BY VERY FAST.

957
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,725
I SAW THE TRUCK IMPACT, FOR 

958
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:32,429
SURE, ONE CYCLIST, WHO WAS 

959
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,132
RIDING NORTH, HIT THE 

960
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:37,467
WINDSHIELD, WENT UP TO THE AIR 

961
00:45:37,467 --> 00:45:40,470
AND LANDED MOTIONLESS.

962
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,439
>> THE TRUCK WENT STRAIGHT FOR 

963
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:43,807
HIM?

964
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,441
>> YEAH.

965
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:45,976
THE TRUCK WASN'T EVEN DEVIATING 

966
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:48,077
ON THE PATH, WAS JUST GOING 

967
00:45:48,077 --> 00:45:49,780
STRAIGHT DOWN, SO IT DOESN'T 

968
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:54,585
LOOK LIKE WAS TRYING TO HIT THE 

969
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,319
CYCLIST BUT SIMPLY GOING AT A 

970
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,954
VERY HIGH SPEED, RIGHT DOWN THE 

971
00:45:57,954 --> 00:46:00,190
MIDDLE OF THE PATH, TAKING OUT 

972
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,592
ANYTHING IN ITS PATH.

973
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,594
>> COULD YOU SEE HOW FAR HE 

974
00:46:04,594 --> 00:46:05,762
DROVE?

975
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:08,231
>> SO, YEAH, THEN I SAW THE 

976
00:46:08,231 --> 00:46:10,267
TRUCK CONTINUING.

977
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,935
THAT WAS ABOUT A BLOCK FARTHER 

978
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,403
ON, WHEN IT COLLIDED WITH 

979
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:14,938
SOMETHING ON CHAMBERS STREET, I 

980
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,873
DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS A UTILITY 

981
00:46:16,873 --> 00:46:18,875
POLE OR WHAT, THE TRUCK SPUN, 

982
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:21,879
THEN WAS FACING EAST.

983
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,546
I SAW THE DRIVER GET OUT OF THE 

984
00:46:23,546 --> 00:46:25,482
CAR AND THEN FLEE.

985
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:27,984
IT LOOKED TO ME HE WAS THEN 

986
00:46:27,984 --> 00:46:31,622
FLEEING SOUTHWARD, AWAY FROM ME.

987
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,991
ABOUT A MINUTE LATER I HEARD A 

988
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:34,358
FEW GUNSHOTS.

989
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,126
AT THAT POINT, SOME OF THE 

990
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,527
OTHERS WHO HAD BEEN WITNESS TO 

991
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:39,396
THIS, STARTED TO RUN THEMSELVES,

992
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:41,197
TO RUN NORTH, AWAY FROM THE 

993
00:46:41,197 --> 00:46:42,299
SOUND OF THE GUNFIRE.

994
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,202
>> WHEN YOU SAW HIM FLEE, COULD 

995
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,403
YOU HEAR HIM SAY ANYTHING?

996
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:48,505
SEE IF HE WAS CARRYING ANYTHING?

997
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:48,738
>> NO.

998
00:46:48,738 --> 00:46:50,640
IT WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO REALLY 

999
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,910
SEE MUCH ABOUT HIM, WHAT HE WAS 

1000
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:53,910
DOING, ALSO VERY DISTRACTING 

1001
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:56,413
BECAUSE THERE WAS PROBABLY A 

1002
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,281
DEAD CYCLIST RIGHT THERE, WHICH 

1003
00:46:58,281 --> 00:46:59,783
WAS THE CONCERN FOR THOSE OF US 

1004
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,318
WHO WERE KLOSE BY.

1005
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,620
>> WHEN YOU'RE WALKING DOWN A 

1006
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,221
PATH LIKE THAT, THIS IS NOT 

1007
00:47:05,221 --> 00:47:08,124
SOMETHING YOU CAN IMAGINE 

1008
00:47:08,124 --> 00:47:08,391
HAPPENING.

1009
00:47:08,391 --> 00:47:09,026
>> EXACTLY.

1010
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:09,927
THIS IS SOMETHING.

1011
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,494
I RIDE ON THAT PATH ALL THE 

1012
00:47:11,494 --> 00:47:11,728
TIME.

1013
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:15,332
THIS IS A KEY RECREATIONAL PART 

1014
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,833
OF NEW YORK CITY.

1015
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:20,837
TO HAVE THAT EVENT HAPPEN IN 

1016
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:23,073
SHADOW, THAT SENSE OF PEACE AND 

1017
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:24,708
RECREATION, WHICH IS WHAT THAT 

1018
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,943
PATH IS ALL ABOUT, IS DEEPLY 

1019
00:47:26,943 --> 00:47:27,243
DISTURBING.

1020
00:47:27,243 --> 00:47:29,079
>> WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE OKAY, 

1021
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:29,312
ANDREW.

1022
00:47:29,312 --> 00:47:30,647
THIS IS QUITE A SERIOUS 

1023
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:30,914
INCIDENT.

1024
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:33,216
THANK YOU FOR FILLING US IN ON 

1025
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:34,785
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

1026
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:36,586
WE LEARNED A LITTLE BIT MORE, 

1027
00:47:36,586 --> 00:47:38,689
RIGHT THERE, TRAVELING AT A VERY

1028
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,190
HIGH SPEED ON THAT PATH, ALMOST 

1029
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,825
NO WAY TO PREVENT SOMETHING LIKE

1030
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:42,025
THAT.

1031
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,060
>> NO.

1032
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,361
A TRUCK THAT SIZE WOULD PRETTY 

1033
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,862
MUCH FILL UP THE PATH.

1034
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,331
I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH IT.

1035
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:48,965
IT'S A WIDE PATH.

1036
00:47:48,965 --> 00:47:51,935
A TRUCK, A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT 

1037
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:53,836
TRUCK, COULDN'T DEVIATE LEFT TO 

1038
00:47:53,836 --> 00:47:54,037
RIGHT.

1039
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,705
HE OBVIOUSLY WANTED TO KILL AS 

1040
00:47:55,705 --> 00:47:57,374
MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE AT A 

1041
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,009
HIGH SPEED AND HE WOULD HAVE 

1042
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:03,213
CONTINUED UNLESS HE DIDN'T HIT 

1043
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,115
WHATEVER HE STRUCK ON CHAMBERS 

1044
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:06,683
STREET.

1045
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:08,852
>> THE RENTAL TRUCK FROM HOME 

1046
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,754
DEPOT ARE COOPERATING RIGHT NOW.

1047
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:12,489
>> EXACTLY.

1048
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,424
THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE CALLING ON 

1049
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:17,327
OTHERS TO DO, GET A TRUCK, AS 

1050
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,029
PIERRE HAS SAID, WHAT YOU HAVE 

1051
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:20,196
SEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN, WHATEVER 

1052
00:48:20,196 --> 00:48:22,599
THEY CAN GET TO TAKE OFF.

1053
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,134
IN THE LONG LIST OF CITIES HIT 

1054
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,269
LIKE THIS, STARTING, I JUST MADE

1055
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:27,037
A LIST HERE.

1056
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:30,040
NICE AND OHIO STATE, BERLIN, 

1057
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,511
JERUSALEM, AND LONDON, THREE 

1058
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:36,079
DIFFERENT, STOCKHOLM, 

1059
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:36,880
CHARLOTTESVILLE AND BARCELONA 

1060
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,081
AND NOW NEW YORK.

1061
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,883
>> NOW, NEW YORK CITY AS WELL.

1062
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:44,521
AND NEW YORK CITY IN FIVE DAYS, 

1063
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:47,457
NEW YORK CITY MARATHON, TENS OF 

1064
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:50,393
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, ALL IN THE 

1065
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:52,596
FIVE BOROUGHS.

1066
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,563
>> THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE 

1067
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:54,931
DEPARTMENT IS STRUCTURED TO 

1068
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:56,133
PROTECT THE MARATHON.

1069
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,934
26 MILES OF INTENSE CROWDS, NO 

1070
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:58,735
QUESTION ABOUT IT.

1071
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:01,571
WHEN THEY GET INTO MANHATTAN, 

1072
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:02,772
PROBABLY A MILLION PEOPLE 

1073
00:49:02,772 --> 00:49:06,009
WATCHING THE ROUTE.

1074
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:07,811
THERE'LL BE A LOT OF BLOCKING 

1075
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:09,312
CARS INVOLVED WITH THE MARATHON 

1076
00:49:09,312 --> 00:49:10,514
AS THEY ALWAYS DO.

1077
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:11,948
THEY WILL INCREASE THAT.

1078
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,383
>> WHAT KIND OF CHANGES WERE PUT

1079
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:14,918
IN PLACE FOR THE MARATHON AFTER 

1080
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:16,453
THE ATTACKS OF THE BOSTON 

1081
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:16,787
MARATHON?

1082
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,120
>> WE PUT IN CAMERAS.

1083
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,423
WE HAD A LOT MORE PORTABLE 

1084
00:49:20,423 --> 00:49:22,492
CAMERAS THAT WE PUT IN, ALL 

1085
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:23,593
ALONG THE ROUTE.

1086
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:25,462
WE WANTED TO INCREASE AS MUCH 

1087
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,697
CAMERA EXPOSURE AS POSSIBLE, 

1088
00:49:27,697 --> 00:49:32,836
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF POLICE 

1089
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:34,838
OFFICERS ASSIGNED.

1090
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:35,839
OVERALL, INCREASE THE SECURITY 

1091
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,807
WHERE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT 

1092
00:49:37,807 --> 00:49:38,041
CROWDS.

1093
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,676
GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE CROWDS 

1094
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:40,877
ARE PRETTY THICK.

1095
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:42,512
SOME THICKER THAN OTHERS.

1096
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:44,814
>> THAT'S WHY GENERALLY 

1097
00:49:44,814 --> 00:49:46,283
DAY-TO-DAY YOU HAVE A 

1098
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:47,183
SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE IN TIME 

1099
00:49:47,183 --> 00:49:47,417
SQUARE.

1100
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,552
NOT NECESSARILY AN AVERAGE 

1101
00:49:49,552 --> 00:49:50,687
NEIGHBORHOOD IN DOWNTOWN NEW 

1102
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:50,887
YORK.

1103
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:52,622
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, ABSOLUTELY 

1104
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:52,823
RIGHT.

1105
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,524
HE WAS SAYING IT WAS ONLY A FEW 

1106
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:57,894
BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE WORLD TRADE

1107
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:58,328
CENTER SITE.

1108
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,396
A LOT OF POLICE THERE BUT NOT 

1109
00:50:00,396 --> 00:50:01,998
ALONG THE BIKE PATH.

1291
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,990
THEY WILL NEED OUR SUPPORT.

1292
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:37,360
I WANT TO ASK ALL NEW YORKERS TO

1293
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,460
BE VIGILANT.

1294
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,163
WE KNOW IT'S HALLOWEEN NIGHT AND

1295
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:41,897
WE KNOW IN THE DAYS AHEAD, 

1296
00:56:41,897 --> 00:56:44,400
PEOPLE WILL BE UNEASY.

1297
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,935
WE ASK ALL NEW YORKERS TO LIVE 

1298
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:47,937
BY THE IDEA OF IF YOU SEE 

1299
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:48,671
SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING, TELL 

1300
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:51,007
AN OFFICER IMMEDIATELY IF YOU 

1301
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:53,276
SEE ANYTHING UNUSUAL, ANYTHING 

1302
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:56,045
THAT WORRIES YOU.

1303
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:57,680
BE VIGILANT AND KNOW THERE WILL 

1304
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,150
BE EXTENSIVE DEPLOYMENTS OF NYPD

1305
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,285
OFFICERS THIS EVENING AND 

1306
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:04,153
THROUGHOUT THE DAYS AHEAD.

1307
00:57:04,153 --> 00:57:06,556
WE WILL ALSO KEEP YOU POSTED AS 

1308
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:08,491
THIS INVESTIGATION CONTINUES AND

1309
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:10,393
AS THE NYPD GAINS MORE 

1310
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:10,693
INFORMATION.

1311
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:15,231
GOVERNOR CUOMO.

1312
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:18,368
>> THANK YOU.

1313
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:21,103
FIRST, OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS 

1314
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:22,438
ARE WITH THOSE NEW YORKERS WHO 

1315
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:24,841
WE LOST TODAY.

1316
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:27,076
IT REMINDS US ALL HOW PRECIOUS 

1317
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:27,944
LIFE IS.

1318
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,812
THEY LEFT THE HOUSE THIS 

1319
00:57:29,812 --> 00:57:31,380
MORNING, THEY WERE ENJOYING THE 

1320
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,117
BEAUTIFUL WESTSIDE OF MANHATTAN,

1321
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,485
ON A BEAUTIFUL FALL DAY, AND 

1322
00:57:36,485 --> 00:57:40,857
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE 

1323
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:41,457
RETURNING HOME.

1324
00:57:41,457 --> 00:57:42,524
THAT SHOCK AND THAT PAIN IS 

1325
00:57:42,524 --> 00:57:44,894
GOING TO BE VERY REAL.

1326
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:46,496
OUR THOUGHTS AND OUR PRAYERS ARE

1327
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:47,697
WITH ALL OF THEM.

1328
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:50,033
OUR FIRST RESPONDERS DID AN 

1329
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:53,570
EXTRAORDINARY JOB, THE NYPD, 

1330
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,772
FDNY, FBI, NEW YORK STATE 

1331
00:57:55,772 --> 00:58:00,543
POLICE, EMS, THEY -- WE HAVE THE

1332
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:01,811
FINEST SECURITY ON THE GLOBE, 

1333
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:05,648
AND TO SEE THEM IN ACTION TODAY 

1334
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:10,086
PROVED THAT ONCE AGAIN.

1335
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:13,489
THE NEW TERRORIST TACTIC, WHICH 

1336
00:58:13,489 --> 00:58:16,292
THEY'VE CALLED FOR PUBLICLY, ARE

1337
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:18,361
THESE LONE WOLVES THAT COMMIT AN

1338
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:19,729
ACT OF TERROR.

1339
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,363
THIS IS ALL VERY PRELIMINARY.

1340
00:58:21,363 --> 00:58:23,566
IT'S ONLY BEEN A COUPLE OF HOURS

1341
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:24,800
BUT AT THIS POINT, THERE'S NO 

1342
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,136
EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST A WIDER PLOT

1343
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:31,741
OR WIDER SCHEME, BUT THE ACTIONS

1344
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:34,977
OF ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO MEANT TO 

1345
00:58:34,977 --> 00:58:40,483
CAUSE PAIN AND HARM AND PROBABLY

1346
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:43,319
DEATH AND THE RESULTING TERROR.

1347
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:46,923
THAT WAS THE PURPOSE.

1348
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:53,363
WE WILL BE VIGILANT, MORE POLICE

1349
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:53,663
EVERYWHERE.

1350
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:54,931
YOU WILL SEE THEM IN THE 

1351
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:57,166
AIRPORT, YOU WILL SEE THEM IN 

1352
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:57,600
THE TUNNELS.

1353
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,602
IT'S NOT BECAUSE THERE IS ANY 

1354
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:01,971
EVIDENCE OF ANY ONGOING THREAT 

1355
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:06,809
OR ANY ADDITIONAL THREAT, IT IS 

1356
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:11,314
JUST OUT OF VIGILANCE AND OUT OF

1357
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:12,882
CAUTION.

1358
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,284
THE TRUTH IS NEW YORK IS AN 

1359
00:59:15,284 --> 00:59:16,285
INTERNATIONAL SYMBOL OF FREEDOM 

1360
00:59:16,285 --> 00:59:18,855
AND DEMOCRACY.

1361
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,923
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE.

1362
00:59:20,923 --> 00:59:22,625
AND WE ARE PROUD OF IT.

1363
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:26,629
THAT ALSO MAKES US A TARGET FOR 

1364
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:31,033
THOSE PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE THOSE 

1365
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:33,469
CONCEPTS.

1366
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:35,037
WE'VE LIVED WITH THIS BEFORE, 

1367
00:59:35,037 --> 00:59:36,572
WE'VE FELT THE PAIN BEFORE, WE 

1368
00:59:36,572 --> 00:59:37,540
FEEL THE PAIN TODAY.

1369
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,043
BUT WE GO FORWARD TOGETHER AND 

1370
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:40,843
WE GO FORWARD STRONGER THAN 

1371
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:45,181
EVER.

1372
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:47,650
WE WON'T LET THEM WIN.

1373
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:50,486
IF WE CHANGE OUR LIVES, WE 

1374
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:53,556
CONTORT OURSELVES TO THEM, THEN 

1375
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:57,660
THEY WIN AND WE LOSE.

1376
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,795
WE'LL GO ABOUT OUR BUSINESS, 

1377
00:59:59,795 --> 01:00:02,465
AGAIN, THERE'S NO ONGOING 

1378
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:04,867
THREAT, THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF 

1379
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,302
THAT AT THIS TIME.

1380
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:11,140
SO THERE'S NO REASON TO HAVE ANY

1381
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:11,473
UNDUE ANXIETY.

1382
01:00:11,473 --> 01:00:13,242
YOU WILL SEE MORE SECURITY 

1383
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:16,212
FORCES, BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE 

1384
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:17,847
IT'S AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION AND

1385
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:22,452
NOT A SIGNAL OF ANYTHING ELSE.

1386
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,886
THERAL BE A CONTINUED 

1387
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:27,457
INVESTIGATION AND JUSTICE WILL 

1388
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:27,690
BE DONE.

1389
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,625
BUT AGAIN, TO THOSE WE LOST, 

1390
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:31,494
THEY'RE IN OUR THOUGHTS AND OUR 

1391
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:31,794
PRAYERS.

1392
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:35,264
TO THE FIRST RESPONDERS, THANK 

1393
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:36,365
YOU, THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE

1394
01:00:36,365 --> 01:00:37,100
JOB YOU DO.

1395
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,102
YOU PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE 

1396
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,370
EVERYDAY AND YOU DO IT BETTER 

1397
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:43,306
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

1398
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:47,476
AND TO NEW YORKERS, NEW YORKERS 

1399
01:00:47,476 --> 01:00:50,913
LIVE YOUR LIFE AND DON'T LET 

1400
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:53,182
THEM CHANGE US OR DETER US IN 

1401
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:56,853
ANY MANNER, SHAPE OR FORM.

1402
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:57,086
>> AMEN.

1403
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:59,288
>> THANK YOU.

1404
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:01,257
>> THANKS, GOVERNOR CUOMO, THANK

1405
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:02,057
YOU, MR. MAYOR.

1406
01:01:02,057 --> 01:01:05,228
AS I SAID, I WILL GO THROUGH THE

1407
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:05,595
CHRONOLOGY HERE.

1408
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:07,864
I KNOW WHEN I'M DONE YOU WILL 

1409
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:09,198
HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

1410
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,634
WE WON'T GO TOO DEEP INTO IT.

1411
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:12,701
IT'S ONLY TWO HOURS.

1412
01:01:12,701 --> 01:01:15,138
AFTER I GO THROUGH THE 

1413
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:16,238
CHRONOLOGY, DAN WILL TALK ABOUT 

1414
01:01:16,238 --> 01:01:17,273
THE INJURIES.

1415
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:20,543
AT 3:05 P.M., A MALE DRIVING A 

1416
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:22,945
RENTED HOME DEPOT PICKUP TRUCK 

1417
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,914
ENTERED THE WESTSIDE HIGHWAY 

1418
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:27,016
BICYCLE PATH AT HALSTON STREET 

1419
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:30,720
STRIKING A NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS

1420
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,622
AND BICYCLISTS ON THE ROUTE.

1421
01:01:33,622 --> 01:01:35,657
AT CHAMBERS STREET IT COLLIDED 

1422
01:01:35,657 --> 01:01:38,294
WITH A SCHOOL BUS INJURING TWO 

1423
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:39,628
ADULTS AND TWO CHILDREN.

1424
01:01:39,628 --> 01:01:43,966
THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK 

1425
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:45,935
BRANDISHED TWO HANDGUNS.

1426
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:47,703
A UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICER 

1427
01:01:47,703 --> 01:01:49,104
ASSIGNED TO THE FIRST PRECINCT 

1428
01:01:49,104 --> 01:01:50,539
CONFRONTED THE SUBJECT AND SHOT 

1429
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:52,108
HIM IN THE ABDOMEN.

1430
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,009
THE SUBJECT WAS WOUNDED AND 

1431
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:55,311
TRANSPORTED TO THE LOCAL 

1432
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:55,678
HOSPITAL.

1433
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:58,447
THE PAINT BALL GUN AND PELLET 

1434
01:01:58,447 --> 01:02:00,016
GUN WERE RECOVERED AT THE SCENE.

1435
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:02,652
THE SUBJECT'S IDENTITY IS NOT 

1436
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:03,519
BEING RELEASED AT THIS TIME 

1437
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,887
PENDING FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

1438
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,822
AT THIS POINT, THERE ARE EIGHT 

1439
01:02:06,822 --> 01:02:07,656
FATALITIES REPORTED IN 

1440
01:02:07,656 --> 01:02:08,657
CONNECTION WITH THIS INCIDENT.

1441
01:02:08,657 --> 01:02:09,291
IN ADDITION, SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE

1442
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:14,029
BEEN INJURED AND COMMISSIONER 

1443
01:02:14,029 --> 01:02:15,664
KNIGHT FROM OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT 

1444
01:02:15,664 --> 01:02:16,899
WILL DISCUSS THAT.

1445
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:17,066
DAN.

1446
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,801
>> THANK YOU, JIM.

1447
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:19,969
AS THE POLICE COMMISSIONER SAID,

1448
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:21,937
SIX OF THE PEOPLE DIED, THEY 

1449
01:02:21,937 --> 01:02:26,008
WERE PRONOUNCED AT THE SCENE.

1450
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,376
BETWEEN HALSTON STREET AND 

1451
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:28,377
CHAMBERS STREET.

1452
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:29,879
THEY WERE ALL MALES.

1453
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:32,347
TWO OTHERS WERE TRANSPORTED IN 

1454
01:02:32,347 --> 01:02:34,283
TRAUMATIC ARREST AND WERE 

1455
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:35,451
PRONOUNCED AT THE HOSPITAL.

1456
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:38,754
WE ALSO TRANSPORTED 11 PEOPLE, 

1457
01:02:38,754 --> 01:02:42,158
ALL WITH SERIOUS BUT AT THIS 

1458
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:43,659
MOMENT, NOT LIFE THREATENING 

1459
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:43,926
INJURIES.

1460
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,361
THE INJURIES ARE WHAT YOU MAY 

1461
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:47,062
EXPECT AS A TRUCK WENT AT HIGH 

1462
01:02:47,062 --> 01:02:49,765
SPEED DOWN THAT BICYCLE PATH AND

1463
01:02:49,765 --> 01:02:52,434
STRUCK BICYCLISTS AND 

1464
01:02:52,434 --> 01:02:52,835
PEDESTRIANS.

1465
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:55,170
THERE MAY BE MORE INJURIES AS 

1466
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:56,672
PEOPLE SELF-EVACUATED AND WE 

1467
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:58,941
WILL DETERMINE THAT LATER, AS WE

1468
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:04,447
DO OUR SURVEY.

1469
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,048
THAT'S THE PATIENT COUNT AND THE

1470
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:08,017

THESE THINGS UNFORTUNATELY ARE 

1836
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,118
THE TYPE OF EXPERIENCE WE'RE 

1837
01:14:17,118 --> 01:14:19,888
GOING TO HAVE IN THIS POST 9/11 

1838
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:20,088
WORLD.

1839
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:21,256
>> IT'S THE TYPE OF EXPERIENCE 

1840
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:26,094
WE HAVE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND 

1841
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:26,294
AGAIN.

1842
01:14:26,294 --> 01:14:28,830
ALL ACROSS EUROPE AND IN THE 

1843
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:30,899
UNITED STATES.

1844
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:35,337
THE ATTACK WE'VE SEEN IN NICE, 

1845
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:36,771
LONDON AND HERE ON HALLOWEEN 

1846
01:14:36,771 --> 01:14:37,272
NIGHT.

1847
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:39,374
>> NEW YORK CITY ALSO THE HOME 

1848
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:39,807
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.

1849
01:14:39,807 --> 01:14:40,975
JOHN IS AT THE WHITE HOUSE NOW 

1850
01:14:40,975 --> 01:14:43,078
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 

1851
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:45,280
BRIEFED AND SEEING HIS FIRST 

1852
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:45,514
TWEETS.

1853
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,849
>> THE PRESIDENT WAS BRIEFED BY 

1854
01:14:47,849 --> 01:14:49,150
CHIEF OF STAFF, JOHN KELLY AND 

1855
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:51,453
WE WILL CONTINUE TO GET UPDATES 

1856
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,989
WE JUST HEARD FROM THE 

1857
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:54,256
PRESIDENT.

1858
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:55,624
IN NEW YORK CITY, LOOKS LIKE 

1859
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:57,726
ANOTHER ATTACK BY A VERY SICK 

1860
01:14:57,726 --> 01:14:59,060
AND DERANGED PERSON.

1861
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:00,095
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS FOLLOWING 

1862
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:02,530
THIS CLOSELY, ALL IN CAPS, NOT 

1863
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:04,032
IN THE USA!

1864
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:05,900
WE ALSO HEARD FROM THE FIRST 

1865
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:08,303
LADY ABOUT THIS ATTACK VIA 

1866
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:08,837
TWITTER.

1867
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,472
SHE TWEETED MY HEART BREAKS FOR 

1868
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:11,306
NEW YORK CITY TODAY.

1869
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:12,741
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS AS WE 

1870
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:13,741
MONITOR THIS SITUATION.

1871
01:15:13,741 --> 01:15:15,377
>> PERHAPS WE'LL HEAR MORE FROM 

1872
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:15,944
THE WHITE HOUSE LATER THIS 

1873
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:17,512
EVENING.

1874
01:15:17,512 --> 01:15:20,082
CAN WE SEE THE DRIVER THERE, AS 

1875
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:21,816
HE CAME OUT OF THE CAR WAVING 

1876
01:15:21,816 --> 01:15:24,086
HIS GUNS, WAS SHOT BY POLICE.

1877
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:25,520
SO FAR, NO CLAIM OF 

1878
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,189
RESPONSIBILITY BY ANY TERROR 

1879
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:27,389
GROUP.

1880
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:28,190
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1881
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:32,461
NO CLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY.

1882
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:34,429
POLICE ARE BASING THEIR 

1883
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:35,630
INFORMATION THIS WAS A TERROR 

1884
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:38,366
ATTACK BY SHOUTING ALLAH AKBAR 

1885
01:15:38,366 --> 01:15:41,503
AND HAD TWO WEAPONS INOPERABLE, 

1886
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:43,171
PAINT GUNS OR PELLET GUNS.

1887
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:44,806
WHAT THEY WILL DO, THEY WILL 

1888
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:47,309
TAKE THAT LICENSE PLATE AND 

1889
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:48,843
BACKTRACK WHERE THAT CAR CAME 

1890
01:15:48,843 --> 01:15:49,043
FROM.

1891
01:15:49,043 --> 01:15:51,013
>> THEY DID NOT SAY -- THEY KNOW

1892
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:53,115
IT WAS A RENTAL CAR AND FROM 

1893
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:53,582
HOME DEPOT.

1894
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:55,717
THEY DID NOT SAY WHERE IT WAS 

1895
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:55,917
FROM.

1896
01:15:55,917 --> 01:15:56,852
NO INFORMATION YET.

1897
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:58,520
>> HOME DEPOT CONFIRMED IT WAS 

1898
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,889
ONE OF THEIR CARS AND THEY WILL 

1899
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:01,923
INSTANTLY KNOW BASED ON THE 

1900
01:16:01,923 --> 01:16:03,258
INFORMATION WHERE THAT'S FROM.

1901
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:06,261
LOOKING AT THE LICENSE PLATE 

1902
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:08,330
NUMBER, COMMISSIONER KELLY 

1903
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:09,431
HELPED INSTALL THAT SYSTEM AND 

1904
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:10,699
THEY CAN SEE IF THERE IS ANYBODY

1905
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:12,633
ELSE THAT MIGHT BE INVOLVED.

1906
01:16:12,633 --> 01:16:14,736
>> THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION, 

1907
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:18,006
PETER THOMAS, SENIOR JUSTICE 

1908
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:18,607
COMMENT.

1909
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:19,874
THE MAYOR LEANED INTO THE IDEA 

1910
01:16:19,874 --> 01:16:23,978
IT WAS A LONE WOLF AND THE 

1911
01:16:23,978 --> 01:16:25,847
POLICE COMMISSIONER DIDN'T SAY 

1912
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:26,815
THEY KNEW FOR SURE. 

1913
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:27,516
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1914
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:28,483
IT'S TOO EARLY.

1915
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:32,854
UNTIL YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT HIS

1916
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:35,590
FRIENDS, FAMILY, WHAT HE'S BEEN 

1917
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:37,592
LOOKING AT, YOU WON'T KNOW.

1918
01:16:37,592 --> 01:16:39,260
IT FITS THE PATTERN OF LONE 

1919
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:41,129
WOLVES INSPIRED BY WHAT THEY MAY

1920
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:43,765
HAVE BEEN SEEING ON THE 

1921
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:44,032
INTERNET.

1922
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:45,533
GEORGE, I CAN TELL YOU, GIVEN 

1923
01:16:45,533 --> 01:16:47,101
THE FREQUENCY, INCREASING 

1924
01:16:47,101 --> 01:16:48,837
FREQUENCY WE'RE SEEING THESE 

1925
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:50,905
KIND OF EVENTS, LAW ENFORCEMENT 

1926
01:16:50,905 --> 01:16:52,507
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE GOING TO 

1927
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:54,275
BE RETHINKING, THEY'RE PUTTING 

1928
01:16:54,275 --> 01:16:55,377
OUT NOTICE AND WARNING.

1929
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:56,344
THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH 

1930
01:16:56,344 --> 01:16:58,346
SOMETHING MORE THAN THEY 

1931
01:16:58,346 --> 01:17:00,047
CURRENTLY HAVE BECAUSE CLEARLY, 

1932
01:17:00,047 --> 01:17:02,317
THIS IS THE MODE OF ATTACK NOT 

1933
01:17:02,317 --> 01:17:04,619
JUST USED BY INTERNATIONAL 

1934
01:17:04,619 --> 01:17:06,488
ISLAMIST TERRORISTS OR LONE 

1935
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:08,990
WOLVES, LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN 

1936
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:10,325
CHARLOTTESVILLE, THAT PERSON 

1937
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:12,327
INVOLVED IN THAT RACIALLY 

1938
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:13,694
MOTIVATED CASE DECIDED TO KILL 

1939
01:17:13,694 --> 01:17:15,097
PEOPLE USING THE SAME METHOD.

1940
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:18,533
>> VERY LOW TECH, USING A PICKUP

1941
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:20,168
TRUCK AND PAINT BALL GUN, NOT 

1942
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:21,102
EVEN A REAL GUN.

1943
01:17:21,102 --> 01:17:23,338
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS SO 

1944
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:23,672
DIFFICULT.

1945
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:25,373
YOU HEARD THE MAYOR SAY AGAIN, 

1946
01:17:25,373 --> 01:17:27,209
SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.

1947
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:29,811
WHAT COULD YOU SEE HERE?

1948
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:32,313
THE GUY MADE A TURN ON HALSTON 

1949
01:17:32,313 --> 01:17:34,783
STREET AND STARTED TO PLOW DOWN 

1950
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:35,083
BICYCLISTS.

1951
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,117
>> IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY, 

1952
01:17:36,117 --> 01:17:37,485
PROBABLY A MINUTE TO GET FROM 

1953
01:17:37,485 --> 01:17:39,587
FOUR BLOCKS DOWN FROM HALSTON 

1954
01:17:39,587 --> 01:17:39,955
STREET.

1955
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:40,589
I ALSO THINK THIS INDIVIDUAL IS 

1956
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:42,290
LOOKING TO DIE.

1957
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:44,459
HE HAD TWO GUNS NOT LETHAL 

1958
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:46,261
WEAPONS AND KNEW THERE WOULD BE 

1959
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:47,695
SOME CONFRONTATION ULTIMATELY 

1960
01:17:47,695 --> 01:17:48,497
WITH THE POLICE.

1961
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,265
HE WANTED TO BE SHOT AND KILLED.

1962
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:53,434
>> IN THAT CASE, WHAT WAS THE 

1963
01:17:53,434 --> 01:17:56,271
ENGAGEMENT FOR POLICE?

1964
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:57,005
WERE THEY SHOOTING TO KILL OR 

1965
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:57,439
INJURE?

1966
01:17:57,439 --> 01:17:58,206
>> NO.

1967
01:17:58,206 --> 01:17:59,541
YOU SHOOT TO STOP.

1968
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:01,342
SHOOT TO INJURE TAKES AN AWFUL 

1969
01:18:01,342 --> 01:18:02,377
LOT OF SKILL.

1970
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:04,345
HE HAD TWO REPS AND THEY WERE 

1971
01:18:04,345 --> 01:18:05,814
APPARENTLY POINTED AT THE 

1972
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:06,281
POLICE.

1973
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:07,715
AT LEAST THEY KNEW HE HAD TWO 

1974
01:18:07,715 --> 01:18:10,185
WEAPONS IN HIS CUSTODY.

1975
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:11,386
IT'S CERTAINLY A REASONABLE 

1976
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:13,321
ACTION ON THE PART OF THE POLICE

1977
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:16,124
OFFICER TO USE HIS WEAPON AND 

1978
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:16,457
YOU STOP HIM.

1979
01:18:16,457 --> 01:18:18,260
YOU SHOOT FOR MASS, YOU DON'T 

1980
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,161
SHOOT TO WOUND.

1981
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:20,362
YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT.

1982
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:23,498
>> BACK ON THE SCENE NOW, GIO 

1983
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:25,400
BENITIZ, YOU THERE?

1984
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,068
>> YEAH, GEORGE.

1985
01:18:27,068 --> 01:18:28,737
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT 

1986
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:30,038
COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THE AREA.

1987
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:32,440
WE'RE WITH ONE OF THE STUDENTS.

1988
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:33,842
TELL ME, WHAT DID YOU SEE?

1989
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:35,444
>> I JUST SAW HIM WALKING WITH 

1990
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:36,912
HIS GUN DOWN THE SIDEWALK.

1991
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:38,046
THAT'S ALL I SEE.

1992
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:42,950
>> YOU ACTUALLY SAW THE GUNMAN?

1993
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:43,485
>> YEAH.

1994
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:44,419
>> WITH THE GUN.

1995
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:45,887
AT THAT POINT, WHAT WERE YOU 

1996
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:46,120
SEEING?

1997
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,757
AT THAT POINT IT MUST HAVE BEEN 

1998
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:49,991
CRAZY AT YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE 

1999
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:51,359
BECAUSE WE'RE TOLD A LOT OF 

2000
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:52,927
SECURITY GUARDS WERE STARTING TO

2001
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,895
LOCK IT DOWN.

2002
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:54,863
>> YEAH.

2003
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:55,430
I WAS OUTSIDE.

2004
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:56,631
>> YOU WERE ON THE STREET?

2005
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:57,165
>> YEAH.

2006
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:59,401
ON THE STREETS, YEAH.

2007
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:00,235
>> DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING?

2008
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:02,003
>> I DID NOT HEAR ANYTHING, NO.

2009
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:03,605
>> BY THE TIME YOU GOT OUT 

2010
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:05,340
THERE, WERE THERE PEOPLE ON THE 

2011
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,209
GROUND, WHAT WAS GOING ON?

2012
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:09,444
>> I WAS UPSTAIRS DOWN THERE.

2013
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:11,313
I JUST SAW HIM WALKING, I DIDN'T

2014
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:12,581
SEE THE ROAD UP THERE.

2015
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:13,882
I COULDN'T SEE THE ROAD.

2016
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:15,917
I WAS UP THERE.

2017
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,052
I JUST SAW HIM WALKING DOWN THE 

2018
01:19:18,052 --> 01:19:19,654
SIDEWALK WITH HIS GUN AND 

2019
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:20,121
HOODIE, MAYBE.

2020
01:19:20,121 --> 01:19:21,489
I HAVE A VIDEO OF IT.

2021
01:19:21,489 --> 01:19:22,924
HE WAS WEARING A HOODIE, 

2022
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:24,826
SOMETHING, I THINK, YEAH.

2023
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:26,060
>> Reporter: I CAN JUST IMAGINE 

2024
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:27,729
WE HAVE AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 

2025
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:28,997
HERE AND YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

2026
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:31,166
THERE'S ONE MORE.

2027
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:32,600
>> THE HIGH SCHOOL THERE, A LOT 

2028
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,435
OF STUDENTS ARE IN THIS AREA ALL

2029
01:19:34,435 --> 01:19:34,769
THE TIME. 

2030
01:19:34,769 --> 01:19:35,937
>> YEAH.

2031
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:38,205
WE WALK THERE EVERY TIME. 

2032
01:19:38,205 --> 01:19:40,275
>> RIGHT ON THE WEST SIDE 

2033
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:40,509
HIGHWAY?

2034
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:41,009
>> YEAH.

2035
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:43,044
>> PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW NEW 

2036
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:43,611
YORK CITY -- 

2037
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:46,314
>> I JUST MOVED HERE FOUR MONTHS

2038
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:47,348
AGO, THIS IS SOMETHING SHOCKING 

2039
01:19:47,348 --> 01:19:49,117
FOR ME TO SEE THIS IN NEW YORK 

2040
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:52,053
IN FRONT OF ONE WORLD TRADE 

2041
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:52,320
CENTER.

2042
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,154
>> Reporter: RIGHT THERE.

2043
01:19:53,154 --> 01:19:54,188
>> RIGHT THERE.

2044
01:19:54,188 --> 01:19:55,423
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

2045
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:58,760
IT WAS SOMETHING SHOCKING FOR 

2046
01:19:58,760 --> 01:19:59,628
ME.

2047
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,297
>> HAMZA, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

2048
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:03,899
GEORGE, YOU'RE HEARING IT RIGHT 

2049
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:05,166
HERE, SO MANY STUDENTS IN THIS 

2050
01:20:05,166 --> 01:20:06,968
AREA AND WHAT MAKES IT SO 

2051
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:08,103
DANGEROUS IN THIS PARTICULAR 

2052
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:09,671
AREA, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS 

2053
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:11,072
WORLD TRADE CENTER AREA, YOU 

2054
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:13,341
THINK IT'S JUST A FINANCIAL 

2055
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:13,608
DISTRICT.

2056
01:20:13,608 --> 01:20:14,376
NOT TRUE.

2057
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:15,610
THERE'S A PARK RIGHT THERE WE 

2058
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:17,479
SAW KIDS PLAYING IN THIS PARK.

2059
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:19,147
THIS IS VERY MUCH A COMMUNITY 

2060
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:20,015
HERE, GEORGE.

2061
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:21,783
>> PEOPLE ARE SAYING BEFORE HE 

2062
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:25,553
DID THIS, HE SAID ALLAH AKBAR.

2063
01:20:25,553 --> 01:20:26,287
>> WHAT?

2064
01:20:26,287 --> 01:20:29,257
>> THE THING, HE WAS FROM THE 

2065
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:31,626
MIDDLE EAST AND MUSLIM AND SAID 

2066
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:31,993
ALLAH AKBAR.

2067
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:34,062
LIKE MANY SAY RIGHT NOW.

2068
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:36,597
WANT TO CLEAR HE WAS NOT FROM 

2069
01:20:36,597 --> 01:20:37,232
MIDDLE EAST.

2070
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:39,133
YOU CAN TELL SOMEONE WAS FROM 

2071
01:20:39,133 --> 01:20:39,601
MIDDLE EAST.

2072
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:41,736
HE WAS WEARING A HOODIE AND ALL,

2073
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:43,338
WHITE AND SPANISH AND ALL AND 

2074
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:46,741
YOU COULDN'T TELL HE'S FROM 

2075
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:50,612
MIDDLE EAST OR MUSLIM AND SAID 

2076
01:20:50,612 --> 01:20:50,979
ALLAH AKBAR.

2077
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:51,846
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.

2078
01:20:51,846 --> 01:20:53,381
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY 

2079
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:55,183
IMPORTANT MOMENT, WHY WE ALWAYS 

2080
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:57,485
TRY TO BE SO CAREFUL IN THE 

2081
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:59,053
INITIAL MINUTES AND HOURS AFTER 

2082
01:20:59,053 --> 01:21:00,121
AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS.

2083
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:01,956
LOTS OF PEOPLE CAN BE ON THE 

2084
01:21:01,956 --> 01:21:04,392
SCENE AND HEAR AND SEE DIFFERENT

2085
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:04,626
THINGS.

2086
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:07,028
>> ABSOLUTELY.

2087
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:09,431
YOU SEE THAT WHEN YOU QUESTION 

2088
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:09,698
WITNESSES.

2089
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:11,766
YOU CAN BE TOTALLY OFF.

2090
01:21:11,766 --> 01:21:14,535
YOU CAN IMAGINE.

2091
01:21:14,535 --> 01:21:15,970
THE CAMERAS ARE SO IMPORTANT 

2092
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:18,106
THESE DAYS TO VERIFY THAT. 

2093
01:21:18,106 --> 01:21:20,075
>> AND NEW YORK CITY HAS A 

2094
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:21,209
PROLIFERATION OF CAMERAS.

2095
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:22,644
>> NEW YORK CITY HAS CAMERAS.

2096
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:24,712
WE ALSO SAW PEOPLE ON THE SCENE 

2097
01:21:24,712 --> 01:21:26,581
PULLED OUT THEIR PHONES AND TOOK

2098
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:27,182
A VIDEO.

2099
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:29,184
THERE'S SOMETHING OF A PATTERN 

2100
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:30,585
HERE, NOT ONLY CITIES BEING 

2101
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:32,754
TARGETED IN THIS LOW TECH WAY, 

2102
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:34,188
GENERALLY IN EUROPE THERE HAVE 

2103
01:21:34,188 --> 01:21:35,790
BEEN MORE INCIDENCES WITH MORE 

2104
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:37,525
COORDINATION, HERE IN THE UNITED

2105
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:38,359
STATES, MORE LONE WOLFS.

2106
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:38,994
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

2107
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:40,728
IN FRANCE AND LONDON, THERE HAVE

2108
01:21:40,728 --> 01:21:42,596
BEEN TEAMS THAT HAVE DONE THE 

2109
01:21:42,596 --> 01:21:43,998
ATTACKS FROM THE VEHICLES AND 

2110
01:21:43,998 --> 01:21:46,468
JUMPED OUT OF THE CARS AND BEGUN

2111
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:48,269
FIRING OR USING KNIVES.

2112
01:21:48,269 --> 01:21:50,271
THAT MUST BE ONE OF THE GREAT 

2113
01:21:50,271 --> 01:21:51,605
CONCERNS INITIALLY HERE THERE 

2114
01:21:51,605 --> 01:21:53,041
MIGHT BE OTHERS BUT HASN'T BEEN 

2115
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:54,808
THE CASE ACCORDING TO 

2116
01:21:54,808 --> 01:21:55,876
COMMISSIONER O'NEILL.

2117
01:21:55,876 --> 01:21:58,913
THAT HAS BEEN THE PATTERN A TEAM

2118
01:21:58,913 --> 01:22:00,748
OF ATTACKERS GET IN A VEHICLE 

2119
01:22:00,748 --> 01:22:02,750
AND TAKE OFF ON CIVILIANS.

2120
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:04,652
>> IN SOME INSTANCES, RAY KELLY,

2121
01:22:04,652 --> 01:22:07,055
YOU HAVE SOME CHATTER AND SOME 

2122
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:08,556
ADVANCE NOTICE AND GO BACK TO 

2123
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:10,091
TRY TO PIECE IT BACK TOGETHER.

2124
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:12,861
WITH A LONE WOLF, NONE AT ALL.

2125
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:15,130
>> AND THEY'RE USING ENCRYPTION 

2126
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:15,530
THESE DAYS.

2127
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:16,898
IT'S THE TYPE OF THING VERY 

2128
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:19,667
DIFFICULT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

2129
01:22:19,667 --> 01:22:20,268
PENETRATE.

2130
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:21,436
THEY'RE USING CERTAIN APPS THAT 

2131
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:23,872
MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GET 

2132
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,340
INTO THEIR COMMUNICATION.

2133
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,041
SO THEIR TRADE CRAFT IS 

2134
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:27,341
IMPROVING.

2135
01:22:27,341 --> 01:22:32,647
THEY DON'T COMMUNICATE.

2136
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:34,048
THEY'RE PERHAPS ON THE INTERNET 

2137
01:22:34,048 --> 01:22:36,217
READING BUT NOT NECESSARILY 

2138
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:36,551
COMMUNICATING.

2139
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:39,253
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE SAW, 

2140
01:22:39,253 --> 01:22:42,390
BRIAN ROSS, PEOPLE CAN SEE 

2141
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:43,458
MESSAGES THEY TRACK WITH 

2142
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:44,625
PROBLEMS THEY'RE ALREADY HAVING 

2143
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:46,561
IN THEIR LIVES AND MAY BE 

2144
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:47,895
MENTALLY ILL UNBALANCED IN SOME 

2145
01:22:47,895 --> 01:22:49,164
WAY AND TAKE OFF.

2146
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:51,366
>> THEY USE THIS FOR EXCUSE AS A

2147
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:52,600
LIFE THAT HAS FAILED AND SEE 

2148
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,437
THIS AS A WAY OUT OF YOUR LIFE.

2149
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:57,171
YOU SUGGESTED THIS WAS SOMEBODY 

2150
01:22:57,171 --> 01:22:58,606
WHO WANTED TO BE SHOT AND SHOT 

2151
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:00,942
IN THE ABDOMEN BY POLICE AND IN 

2152
01:23:00,942 --> 01:23:02,110
CUSTODY TONIGHT.

2153
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,544
IT'S CERTAINLY CLEAR WE WILL 

2154
01:23:03,544 --> 01:23:06,314
KNOW SOON, VERY SOON A LOT ABOUT

2155
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:06,748
HIM.

2156
01:23:06,748 --> 01:23:08,283
>> WHERE HE'S FROM.

2157
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:10,118
WE BELIEVE HE WAS FROM TAMPA AND

2158
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:11,586
WE WILL FIND OUT OTHER PLACES HE

2159
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:12,887
MAY HAVE LIVED.

2160
01:23:12,887 --> 01:23:15,290
WE KNOW WHERE HE RENTED THE CAR 

2161
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:15,490
FROM.

2162
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,258
AS MUCH AS WE LEARN SOMETIMES 

2163
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:18,159
THAT STILL DOESN'T GIVE THE 

2164
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,461
ANSWER I HAVE IN MY HEAD, THAT 

2165
01:23:20,461 --> 01:23:22,096
LAS VEGAS SHOOTING, WE STILL 

2166
01:23:22,096 --> 01:23:23,331
DON'T KNOW WHAT DROVE HIM.

2167
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:24,332
>> ABSOLUTELY.

2168
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:26,367
THAT IS ONE BIG MYSTERY.

2169
01:23:26,367 --> 01:23:28,736
COULD BE THIS INDIVIDUAL JUST 

2170
01:23:28,736 --> 01:23:31,272
WANTED TO BE -- HAVE HIS NAME IN

2171
01:23:31,272 --> 01:23:33,308
HISTORY, A BIZARRE DESIRE TO BE 

2172
01:23:33,308 --> 01:23:35,243
KNOWN, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE 

2173
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:36,377
SHOOTER IN LAS VEGAS.

2174
01:23:36,377 --> 01:23:39,614
SO FAR, NOTHING HAS COME UP TO 

2175
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:42,483
SHOW HE'S PARTICULARLY ABERRANT.

2176
01:23:42,483 --> 01:23:44,819
>> ONE OF THE KEY THINGS OF THIS

2177
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:48,456
INCIDENT, I WANT TO KNOW IF THE 

2178
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:49,924
SUSPECT, THE DRIVER WAS IN THE 

2179
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:51,526
AREA OR DELIBERATELY CAME.

2180
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:52,861
>> RIGHT.

2181
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:53,661
>> TO NEW YORK CITY.

2182
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:56,764
>> HE DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE ANY

2183
01:23:56,764 --> 01:23:57,932
KNOWN NEW YORK ADDRESS.

2184
01:23:57,932 --> 01:24:00,001
WE HAVE SEEN ADDRESS IN OTHER 

2185
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:01,736
STATES, INCLUDING TAMPA, 

2186
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:01,969
FLORIDA.

2187
01:24:01,969 --> 01:24:03,371
WHAT BROUGHT HIM HERE AND WHY IS

2188
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:05,173
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WANT TO 

2189
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:06,508
KNOW RIGHT AWAY.

2190
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:07,976
THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE 

2191
01:24:07,976 --> 01:24:10,178
INDICATION, DID THEY SEND HIM 

2192
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:12,413
HERE OR READ SOMETHING OR 

2193
01:24:12,413 --> 01:24:12,680
INSPIRED?

2194
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,315
THAT WILL BE A KEY QUESTION THE 

2195
01:24:14,315 --> 01:24:17,385
FBI WANTS TO PURSUE INFORMS OF 

2196
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:17,652
TERRORISM.

2197
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:19,153
IS THIS SOMEBODY INSPIRED OVER 

2198
01:24:19,153 --> 01:24:20,921
WHAT THEY READ OVER THE INTERNET

2199
01:24:20,921 --> 01:24:21,622
OR DIRECTED.

2200
01:24:21,622 --> 01:24:23,091
MOST LIKELY INSPIRED.

2201
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:25,827
>> YOU HEARD THE MAYOR SAY THIS 

2202
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:27,428
IS A JOINT EFFORT, FBI TAKING 

2203
01:24:27,428 --> 01:24:28,062
THE LEAD?

2204
01:24:28,062 --> 01:24:29,430
>> IT'S JOINT.

2205
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:31,865
THE NYPD HAS VAST RESOURCES AS 

2206
01:24:31,865 --> 01:24:33,034
RAY KELLY WILL TELL YOU.

2207
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:34,936
WHERE THE FBI WILL BE 

2208
01:24:34,936 --> 01:24:35,803
PARTICULARLY USEFUL IS WORKING 

2209
01:24:35,803 --> 01:24:43,311
WITH STATE PARTNERS.

2210
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:47,015
THEY WILL BE IN CONTACT WITH 

2211
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:47,881
AUTHORITIES AND EVERY 

2212
01:24:47,881 --> 01:24:49,117
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY WE HAVE WILL

2213
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:51,085
BE INVOLVED LOOKING AT THIS 

2214
01:24:51,085 --> 01:24:52,453
MAN'S BACKGROUND AND WANT TO 

2215
01:24:52,453 --> 01:24:54,956
KNOW DID HE RECENTLY TRAVEL 

2216
01:24:54,956 --> 01:24:57,192
OVERSEAS AND IF SO, WHERE DID HE

2217
01:24:57,192 --> 01:24:57,358
GO?

2218
01:24:57,358 --> 01:25:05,967
WHO MIGHT HE HAVE MET WITH?

2219
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:07,768
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THEY TRAIN 

2220
01:25:07,768 --> 01:25:10,405
FOR EVERY DAY TO GET INFORMATION

2221
01:25:10,405 --> 01:25:13,574
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IN A 

2222
01:25:13,574 --> 01:25:14,742
NAME SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 

2223
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:16,277
CAN HAVE ASSESSMENT OF WHAT ARE 

2224
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:17,278
WE LOOKING AT?

2225
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:19,781
IS THERE A POSSIBILITY OF MORE 

2226
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:20,014
COMING?

2227
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:22,016
RIGHT NOW, THAT IS THE EFFORT TO

2228
01:25:22,016 --> 01:25:22,717
DETERMINE EXACTLY WHO WE'RE 

2229
01:25:22,717 --> 01:25:24,385
DEALING WITH AND WHAT IS THE 

2230
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:25,653
POTENTIAL THERE COULD BE 

2231
01:25:25,653 --> 01:25:26,487
SOMETHING ELSE.

2232
01:25:26,487 --> 01:25:28,022
AGAIN, NO INDICATION OF THAT BUT

2233
01:25:28,022 --> 01:25:31,559
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.

2234
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:32,827
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

2235
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:33,994
BRIAN ROSS, YOU WANT TO KNOW IF 

2236
01:25:33,994 --> 01:25:36,931
THEY WENT OVERSEAS.

2237
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:38,365
IN THIS SITUATION, IT DOESN'T 

2238
01:25:38,365 --> 01:25:39,834
TAKE ANY TRAINING AT ALL.

2239
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:41,569
>> NONE.

2240
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:42,337
EXTREMELY LOW TECH.

2241
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:44,672
THE ABILITY TO RENT A TRUCK AND 

2242
01:25:44,672 --> 01:25:47,442
MOE DOWN CIVILIANS, IN THIS CASE

2243
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:50,845
BICYCLISTS ON A BIKE PATH NOT 

2244
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:52,079
PROTECTED BY THE STANDS AND 

2245
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:53,448
BARRICADES ESTABLISHED IN TIME 

2246
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:53,681
SQUARE.

2247
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:55,250
>> THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO 

2248
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:56,718
ASK, WE ALL KNOW IN WASHINGTON, 

2249
01:25:56,718 --> 01:25:57,952
D.C. IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE

2250
01:25:57,952 --> 01:26:00,254
YOU SEE STANDS AND BARRIERS AND 

2251
01:26:00,254 --> 01:26:02,890
IN TIME SQUARE AND OTHER FEDERAL

2252
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:03,157
BUILDINGS.

2253
01:26:03,157 --> 01:26:04,659
YOU CAN'T HAVE THOSE TYPES OF 

2254
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,160
BARRIERS EVERYWHERE, YOU 

2255
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,162
COULDN'T GET AROUND THE CITY.

2256
01:26:08,162 --> 01:26:10,365
>> AND BY THE WAY, THEY'RE VERY 

2257
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:12,166
EXPENSIVE AND NOT EASY.

2258
01:26:12,166 --> 01:26:14,835
AND EVEN IN TIME SQUARE THEY 

2259
01:26:14,835 --> 01:26:17,672
CAN'T GET AROUND IT BECAUSE OF 

2260
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:18,772
THE COMPLEXITY.

2261
01:26:18,772 --> 01:26:22,844
TO HAVE THEM EVERYWHERE IS 

2262
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:23,144
UNREALISTIC.

2263
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:25,480
>> BACK ON THE SCENE, RIGHT NOW,

2264
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:26,013
RETURNING TO ANY KIND OF 

2265
01:26:26,013 --> 01:26:30,118
NORMALCY?

2266
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:31,719
>> Reporter: GEORGE, POLICE ARE 

2267
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:32,887
STARTING TO LET LOCAL RESIDENTS 

2268
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:34,889
IN THIS AREA CROSS THE STREET.

2269
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:36,057
NOT A WHOLE LOT CHANGED OTHER 

2270
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:37,692
THAN THAT.

2271
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:40,428
WE KEEP SEEING NUMEROUS POLICE 

2272
01:26:40,428 --> 01:26:41,028
VEHICLES HEADED TOWARDS THE 

2273
01:26:41,028 --> 01:26:43,564
CRIME SCENE.

2274
01:26:43,564 --> 01:26:46,734
WE SAW HEAVY EMERGENCY SERVICES 

2275
01:26:46,734 --> 01:26:47,468
EQUIPMENT, BIG LIGHTS GETTING 

2276
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:49,770
READY FOR A LONG NIGHT TO 

2277
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:50,371
PROCESS THAT SCENE.

2278
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:52,240
WE HAVE SEEN THE FBI RESPONSE 

2279
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:53,474
TEAM AS WELL.

2280
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:54,576
INTERESTING, WE'RE SEEING A LOT 

2281
01:26:54,576 --> 01:26:57,511
OF NEW YORKERS GATHERING AROUND 

2282
01:26:57,511 --> 01:26:59,080
SOAKING UP WHAT HAS HAPPENED, A 

2283
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:02,016
LOT OF PEOPLE ON THEIR PHONES, 

2284
01:27:02,016 --> 01:27:03,617
GOING LIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA, 

2285
01:27:03,617 --> 01:27:04,985
DESCRIBING THE SCENE DOWN HERE, 

2286
01:27:04,985 --> 01:27:06,386
KIND OF SURREAL FOR A LOT OF 

2287
01:27:06,386 --> 01:27:07,888
PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THIS AREA 

2288
01:27:07,888 --> 01:27:10,658
WHO HAVE FEARED THIS AND HERE IT

2289
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:11,392
IS.

2290
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:13,027
WE HEARD FROM THE MAYOR AND FROM

2291
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:14,495
THE GOVERNOR THAT NEW YORKERS, 

2292
01:27:14,495 --> 01:27:16,898
THEY WANT THEM TO BE VIGILANT 

2293
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:17,365
TONIGHT.

2294
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:19,701
THEY WANT THEM TO BE VIGILANT 

2295
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:21,969
ALWAYS, LIVE BY THAT RULE, IF 

2296
01:27:21,969 --> 01:27:23,438
YOU SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING.

2297
01:27:23,438 --> 01:27:25,005
THE MAYOR AND GOVERNOR, TELLING 

2298
01:27:25,005 --> 01:27:26,507
PEOPLE TO GO ABOUT THEIR 

2299
01:27:26,507 --> 01:27:27,075
BUSINESS.

2300
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:28,843
DO NOT LET THIS STOP YOU.

2301
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:31,112
THEY SAID, THERE WILL BE EXTRA 

2302
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:32,346
POLICE ALL OVER THE CITY 

2303
01:27:32,346 --> 01:27:32,580
TONIGHT.

2304
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,315
EXPECT TO SEE HEAVY GUN TEAMS 

2305
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:35,049
AND SAND TRUCKS.

2306
01:27:35,049 --> 01:27:40,654
THEY WILL LET THAT WEST VILLAGE 

2307
01:27:40,654 --> 01:27:43,024
PARADE GO AHEAD.

2308
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:44,859
IT IS BUSINESS AS USUAL.

2309
01:27:44,859 --> 01:27:45,593
>> THANK YOU.

2310
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:47,428
>> IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO SEND 

2311
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:49,464
THAT MESSAGE.

2312
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:52,834
>> THINGS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD

2313
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:55,202
MADE PEOPLE UNEASY AND THIS 

2314
01:27:55,202 --> 01:27:57,338
COMPOUNDS THIS.

2315
01:27:57,338 --> 01:27:59,240
VERY IMPORTANT TO LET THEM KNOW 

2316
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,342
THEY'LL BE PROTECTED AND A LOT 

2317
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:02,610
OF OF ADDITIONAL SECURITY NOT 

2318
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:04,612
ONLY AT THE PARADE BUT OTHER 

2319
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:06,247
PLACES IN THE CITY AND THERE 

2320
01:28:06,247 --> 01:28:08,149
WILL BE OTHER SMALLER 

2321
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:08,516
CELEBRATIONS.

2322
01:28:08,516 --> 01:28:10,618
IF ANYBODY CAN DO IT, IT'S THIS 

2323
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:11,452
POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THE

2324
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:14,288
SIZE AND EQUIPMENT IT HAS.

2325
01:28:14,288 --> 01:28:17,158
>> COUNTER-EXPERT JOINING US NOW

2326
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:18,325
FROM WASHINGTON, D.C., ONE OF 

2327
01:28:18,325 --> 01:28:19,493
THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN TALKING 

2328
01:28:19,493 --> 01:28:21,962
ABOUT IS THE PATTERN WE'VE SEEN 

2329
01:28:21,962 --> 01:28:24,632
FOR THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS 

2330
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:25,966
EVER SINCE THE CALL WENT OUT 

2331
01:28:25,966 --> 01:28:27,969
FROM ISIS, FIND A WAY TO ATTACK 

2332
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:29,170
IN ANY WAY YOU CAN.

2333
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:32,673
LOW TECH ATTACKS, MAJOR CAPITALS

2334
01:28:32,673 --> 01:28:33,708
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

2335
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:36,410
>> THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE.

2336
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:37,178
EVERY TIME THIS HAPPENS IT 

2337
01:28:37,178 --> 01:28:39,046
INSPIRES THE THOUGHT IN ANOTHER 

2338
01:28:39,046 --> 01:28:40,514
POTENTIAL ATTACKER, MAYBE I CAN 

2339
01:28:40,514 --> 01:28:41,749
DO THAT.

2340
01:28:41,749 --> 01:28:43,517
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THAT HARD.

2341
01:28:43,517 --> 01:28:48,022
MAYBE THIS IS THE WAY I CAN 

2342
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:48,856
CONTRIBUTE.

2343
01:28:48,856 --> 01:28:50,992
THIS IS A CHRONIC CONDITION FOR 

2344
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:52,226
CITIES AROUND THE WORLD.

2345
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:54,128
ISIS IS NOT DEFEATED, ONLY 

2346
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:56,497
DEFEATED IN THE BATTLEFIELD AND 

2347
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:58,099
NOT DEFEATED ON THE STREETS.

2348
01:28:58,099 --> 01:28:59,366
EVERY CITY NEEDS TO LOOK AT 

2349
01:28:59,366 --> 01:29:01,101
EVERY EVENT AND SEE IF IT CAN 

2350
01:29:01,101 --> 01:29:02,603
BLOCK THOSE ACCESS POINTS.

2351
01:29:02,603 --> 01:29:04,939
AS RAY KELLY SAID, WITH SAND 

2352
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:06,240
TRUCKS AND POLICE CARS.

2353
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,843
>> EVERY CITY HAS TO DO IT, I 

2354
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:10,077
WONDER HOW WE ALL HANDLE IT.

2355
01:29:10,077 --> 01:29:11,612
YOU SAY PEOPLE SEE THIS, THEY 

2356
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:13,481
GET INSPIRED BY IT.

2357
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:14,515
IT COULD INSPIRE SOMEONE ELSE TO

2358
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:15,850
GO DO IT.

2359
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,451
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT OUR 

2360
01:29:17,451 --> 01:29:19,086
RESPONSIBILITY AND HOW WE HANDLE

2361
01:29:19,086 --> 01:29:19,286
THIS?

2362
01:29:19,286 --> 01:29:21,088
>> IT MEANS IF WE THINK WE KNOW 

2363
01:29:21,088 --> 01:29:25,126
SOMEONE WHO IS ACTING 

2364
01:29:25,126 --> 01:29:27,228
DIFFERENTLY, IF THEY SUDDENLY 

2365
01:29:27,228 --> 01:29:30,865
BECOME VERY RELIGIOUS IN ISLAM, 

2366
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:32,633
THEY'RE GOING TO STRANGE 

2367
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:34,602
WEBSITES, BEING SECRETIVE, 

2368
01:29:34,602 --> 01:29:35,636
MEETING WITH NEW PEOPLE, YOU 

2369
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:36,604
NEED TO TELL SOMEBODY.

2370
01:29:36,604 --> 01:29:41,042
TELL YOUR MOM, TELL ANOTHER 

2371
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:42,576
FRIEND, IF YOU SEE THAT KIND OF 

2372
01:29:42,576 --> 01:29:44,745
ODD CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR, DON'T 

2373
01:29:44,745 --> 01:29:46,380
JUST DO NOTHING.

2374
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:48,315
>> AND IT OFTEN OR NOT DOES 

2375
01:29:48,315 --> 01:29:49,684
PRECEDE THE ATTACKS?

2376
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:50,685
>> IT USUALLY DOES.

2377
01:29:50,685 --> 01:29:52,719
>> AND ON THE SCENE AS WELL, 

2378
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:54,956
WE'VE HEARD FROM THE OFFICIALS, 

2379
