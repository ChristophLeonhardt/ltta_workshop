what was worse NDP candidate has Lee Maria's quoting Hitler in a Facebook posting or the way in which NDP Leader Andrea Horwath handled the fallout you be the judge you know I used to work for an editor who told me that it never fails at least three times a year somebody in public office or vying for public office will make a completely inappropriate comment involving Adolf Hitler I think we have the first one of 2018 here in Ontario although the original source material does date back ITAT you see last week it was revealed that Scarborough Agincourt NDP candidate Haslam Ria's made a 2013 Facebook posting that featured a photo of Hitler saluting along with the quote if you don't like a rule just follow it reach on the top and change the rule good grief what rule change would that be reclassifying Jewish citizens as subhumans and then slaughtering them on mass public relations 101 time here if you're going to quote Hitler don't let the quote Stan Dunn challenge because the takeaway is that you implicitly agree with the quote and/or you actually admire the odious orator and if you really really must play the Hitler card don't do it simply because you disagree with an individual or the politics of that individual that kind of trivializes Nazism and the Holocaust by the way this doesn't mean you can never use a Hitler reference if for example the target of your criticism is planning on carrying out oh I don't know an act of genocide well go ahead and employ the Fuhrer in your language but for rias there were other signs of nuttiness left on her social media footprint take for example a 2011 Facebook post in which Ria's referred to the Canadian mission in Afghanistan as a quote slaughtering machine end quote and urged her fellow Muslim brothers and sisters to vote for former NDP leader Jack Lane because the federal NDP's forum policy positions best aligned with their views as an aside aren't Muslims themselves the frontrunners when it comes to slaughtering the vast majority of l'm brothers and sisters i think it's that whole sunni versus shia thing both posts are appalling but Riis's response was outright cowardly she says she can't even recall making the hitler post she doesn't even bother addressing the Canadian soldiers killing Muslims allegation but equally appalling as whore West's response last Friday in standing by her candidate Horwath had this to say quote it's upsetting to see that kind of accusation being made but let me be pretty clear about our candidate I've known tez lien for some time now this woman is an activist in the Interfaith community and so I find it pretty unbelievable that she would be in any way implicated and anything at all that's anti-semitic end quote so because Horwath finds it hard to believe is she therefore implying this posting didn't actually happen kind of like if no one's in the force to hear the tree fall that therefore didn't make any noise but PC MPP Gila Martel rightly notes that quote you don't post Nazi messages on social media by mistake it goes without saying that having miss Ria's on the ballot is offensive to every Jewish person in Ontario frankly it's offensive to all Ontarians with any sense of human decency end quote but Horwath is sticking by her allegedly anti-semitic candidate just as she stuck by Laura chemin Kerr the Looney tune candidate for Mississauga Centre who refuses to wear a poppy and subscribes to outlandish 9/11 conspiracy theories Oh in this just in check out the NDP candidate for Brampton East Gorton Singh here's a picture of him at a 2006 demonstration brandishing a sign that reads F the police by the way Gorton is the brother of federal NDP leader jug meat saying so it's all kind of unnerving isn't it as change famished Ontarians head to the polls next week they must surely ask themselves whether this orange-hued band of radicalized not-ready-for-prime-time players are the people they want in government for the next four or five years and that includes head honcho Horwath herself whose damage control strategy seems to be blaming the messenger as opposed to making tough decisions regarding her own candidates for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks you might have heard the rebel has a brand new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
