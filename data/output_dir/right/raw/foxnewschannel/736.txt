1
00:00:04,302 --> 00:01:13,236
EACH OTHER.

2
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:13,870
>> Laura: THANK YOU, DOG.

3
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:14,538
CONGRESSWOMAN MAXINE WATERS

4
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:15,238
DENIES THAT SHE SAID ANYTHING

5
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:15,972
THAT EQUATES TO WHAT SHE CLAIMS

6
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:16,640
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAYS ABOUT

7
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:17,374
STIRRING UP VIOLENCE AGAINST THE

8
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:17,774
OPPOSITION.

9
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:18,475
JOINING US NOW, MIKE HUCKABEE.

10
00:01:18,476 --> 00:01:19,209
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

11
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:19,910
>> THANKS SHANNON, GREAT TO BE

12
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:20,210
HERE.

13
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:20,877
AND FOR MAXINE WATERS TO SAY

14
00:01:20,878 --> 00:01:21,611
THAT SHE DIDN'T SAY WHAT WE SAW

15
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:22,312
HER STAY ON CAMERA TELLS US A

16
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:23,914
>> Laura: IT YOU WROTE AN

17
00:01:23,915 --> 00:01:24,648
INTERESTING PIECE DEFENDING OUR

18
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:25,382
DAUGHTER AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT

19
00:01:26,817 --> 00:01:27,384
VANDALIZE THEIR MENU.

20
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:29,386
HE SAY YOU SHOULDN'T SEEK TO THE

21
00:01:29,387 --> 00:01:29,786
SAME LEVEL.

22
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:30,387
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

23
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:30,820
>> ABSOLUTELY.

24
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:31,488
THAT DOESN'T GAIN ANYTHING.

25
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:32,222
I THINK MY DAUGHTER HANDLED THIS

26
00:01:32,223 --> 00:01:32,956
NOT ONLY SKILLFULLY BUT I THINK

27
00:01:32,957 --> 00:01:33,690
RESPECTFULLY AND SHE DID IT IN A

28
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:35,492
BUT LET'S KEEP IN MIND WHY SHE

29
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:37,494
SHE DIDN'T THROW FOOD ON ANYONE,

30
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:37,994
SHE WASN'T DRUNK.

31
00:01:37,995 --> 00:01:38,695
SHE GOT THROWN OUT BECAUSE SHE

32
00:01:38,696 --> 00:01:39,362
WORKED FOR THE PRESIDENT OF

33
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:41,164
UNITED STATES.

34
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:41,865
WHEN YOU DENY A MILAN PERSON'S

35
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:43,300
LIBERTY BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE

36
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:45,468
AND THAT IS WHAT OUGHT TO BE OF

37
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:45,969
CONCERN TO PEOPLE.

38
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:46,570
>> Laura: SHE HAD SOME

39
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:47,337
INTERESTING

40
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:50,840
RIGHT TIME OR PLACE TO BE GOING

41
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:51,575
AFTER PEOPLE.

42
00:01:51,576 --> 00:01:54,578
SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE

43
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:58,348
DINNER, TALKING ABOUT HER AND

44
00:01:58,349 --> 00:01:59,316
OTHERS.

45
00:01:59,317 --> 00:02:01,985
AND DAVID AXELROD OF THE OBAMA

46
00:02:01,986 --> 00:02:03,486
ADMINISTRATION, HE CAME TO HER

47
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:05,255
DEFENSE AND SAID HE THOUGHT THAT

48
00:02:05,256 --> 00:02:07,290
IT WAS WRONG.

49
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:12,295
THEN TODAY HE FOLLOWED UP WITH

50
00:02:12,296 --> 00:02:14,431
THIS SWEET, NOT GOOD OR EVEN

51
00:02:14,432 --> 00:02:15,298
EFFECTIVE.

52
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:18,101
BUT UNLESS AND UNTIL POTUS STOPS

53
00:02:18,102 --> 00:02:19,502
REGULARLY INSULTING OPPONENTS

54
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:20,537
AND INCITING SUPPORTERS, SANDERS

55
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:24,874
FOR STABILITY LIKE SHE DID TODAY

56
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:25,408
FOR STABILITY LIKE SHE DID TODA

57
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:25,709
TODAY.

58
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,711
YOUR RESPONSE?

59
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,312
>> I LIKE DAVID AXELROD.

60
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:31,715
HE'S A GOOD GUY AND HE AND I

61
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:33,116
HAVE ENJOYED A NICE FRIENDSHIP,

62
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:35,552
BUT I THINK HE'S WRONG ABOUT

63
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:35,852
THIS.

64
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:36,987
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT

65
00:02:36,988 --> 00:02:37,420
HAPPENED.

66
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:39,723
THIS A PUBLIC BUSINESS AND IT'S

67
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:41,725
NOT THAT SARAH WAS ASKING FOR

68
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:42,959
SOMETHING OFF THE MENU OR

69
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,460
SOMETHING UNIQUE.

70
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:45,528
SHE JUST WANTED TO HAVE A QUIET

71
00:02:45,529 --> 00:02:47,731
DINNER WITH HER FAMILY AND SHE

72
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:48,932
WAS ASKED TO LEAVE.

73
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:50,367
FRANKLY IF I WERE RUNNING A

74
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:51,701
BUSINESS I WOULD WANT TO HAVE

75
00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:53,136
THE PEOPLE I DIDN'T LIKE AND

76
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:53,703
AGREE WITH.

77
00:02:53,704 --> 00:02:55,505
BECAUSE I WOULD USE THAT MONEY

78
00:02:55,506 --> 00:02:57,540
FOR THINGS THEY DIDN'T LIKE.

79
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,977
FOR EXAMPLE, THE BUSINESSES I

80
00:03:00,978 --> 00:03:01,645
HAVE, I WANT EVERY LEVEL TO

81
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:02,379
SPEND AS MUCH MONEY WITH ME AS

82
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:02,979
THEY CAN.

83
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,782
I WILL GIVE IT TO CHURCH AND

84
00:03:05,783 --> 00:03:06,316
PRO-LIFE CANDIDATES.

85
00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:07,317
I'M SURE THAT WILL DRIVE THEM

86
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:08,885
NUTS BUT I WOULD NEVER TURN MY

87
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:10,153
BUSINESS AWAY BECAUSE THEY

88
00:03:10,154 --> 00:03:10,954
DISAGREE WITH ME.

89
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:12,555
I THINK WE ARE GETTING

90
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:13,323
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE IN THIS

91
00:03:13,324 --> 00:03:14,658
COUNTRY WHEN IN THE NAME OF OPEN

92
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:15,792
EXPRESSION WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP

93
00:03:15,793 --> 00:03:18,161
SOME PEOPLE FROM EVEN BEING ABLE

94
00:03:18,162 --> 00:03:19,529
TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION.

95
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,331
MORE IMPORTANTLY, JUST BEING

96
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:24,300
ABLE TO GO AND HAVE DINNER, FOR

97
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:24,734
HEAVEN SAKES.

98
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:27,303
>> Laura:           >> Shannon:I

99
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:27,337
>> Laura:           >> Shannon:'

100
00:03:27,338 --> 00:03:27,370
>> Laura:           >> Shannon:S

101

107
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:27,804
>> Laura:           >> Shannon:E

108
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:30,907
A CONVERSATION IN THE MIDST OF

109
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:31,207
THIS.

110
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,576
I'M GOING TO PUT UP THIS TWEET.

111
00:03:33,577 --> 00:03:34,678
WITH A PICTURE OF PEOPLE WHO

112
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:37,614
LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE GANG

113
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:39,482
MEMBERS, YOU TALK ABOUT THE

114
00:03:39,483 --> 00:03:40,717
TAKE BACK OF THE HOUSE.

115
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:42,619
FOLKS ARE SAYING IT WAS RACIST

116
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,522
AND INSENSITIVE AND YOU ARE

117
00:03:45,523 --> 00:03:47,123
ADDING TO THIS COMBUSTED

118
00:03:47,124 --> 00:03:47,557
CONVERSATION.

119
00:03:47,558 --> 00:03:48,324
>> HOW RIDICULOUS.

120
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:50,226
FIRST OF ALL, IT WAS SATIRE.

121
00:03:50,227 --> 00:03:52,328
I TELL PEOPLE ALL THE TIME AND I

122
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:53,730
REGULARLY POST ON MY TWITTER

123
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:58,234
HUMOR AND YOU CANNOT HANDLE

124
00:03:58,235 --> 00:03:59,502
SATIRE, PLEASE DON'T FOLLOW ME.

125
00:03:59,503 --> 00:04:02,639
BUT I WANT TO MAKE THIS ABOUT

126
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:02,939
RACE.

127
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,609
WHAT RACE WAS I TALKING ABOUT?

128
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,944
CRIMINAL GANG?

129
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:09,179
PEOPLE WHO MURDERED, AND

130
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,380
MUTILATE LITTLE CHILDREN

131
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:12,315
CHILDREN, THAT'S NOT A RACE OF

132
00:04:12,316 --> 00:04:12,649
PEOPLE.

133
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,384
THAT IS A GANG OF CRIMINALS.

134
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:15,318
THERE'S NOTHING TO DEFEND AND

135
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,454
I'M AMAZED THAT THERE WERE

136
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:19,221
PEOPLE OUT THERE DEFENDING MS-13

137
00:04:19,223 --> 00:04:21,524
AND SOMEHOW SAYING THAT WE WERE

138
00:04:21,524 --> 00:04:22,992
NICE ENOUGH TO THEM.

139
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:25,929
I DON'T WANT TO BE NICE, I WANT

140
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,464
THEM TO BE OUT OF BUSINESS.

141
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:28,598
I APPRECIATE THE PRESIDENT FOR

142
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:30,600
WANTING TO TREAT THEM OUT THEY

143
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:32,135
ARE, AS CRIMINALS, AND PEOPLE

144
00:04:32,136 --> 00:00:00,000
WHO ARE PREDATORS FOR LITTLE
