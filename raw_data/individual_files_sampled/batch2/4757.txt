Christopher Hill he's also an NBC News analyst ambassador hill good to see you sir pleasure let me start with the news about Pompeo back-channeling meeting with kim jong-un one would assume if the president United States was going to sit down with Kim jong-un that there would be some sort of intermarry intermediary meeting like this what do you make of it well first of all I think there needed to be a meeting and the concern that everyone had was there was absolutely nothing going on so the fact that he sent what is probably his most trusted advisor out to Pyongyang I think it was actually a good sign and I I don't think Pompeo did it as the incoming Secretary of State that is I don't think he was presuming his confirmation I think he did it as the CIA director and those are the people that I think president Trump has more confidence in so I think it was probably a good move the issue will come up of course Pompeyo in the meantime after being in North Korea was talking to senators and obviously didn't breathe a word of it and then when the president met with the Japanese he kind of had to tell them and once you tell the Japanese I think it's important to tell the American people so obviously this has been ragged as often these things are with the Trump administration but I think the general issue of talking to the of talking of the North Koreans in advance and getting some notion of what this meeting might look like I think is is useful and and definitely something they had to do what's interesting here about Mike Pompeo playing intermediary here is that in his role as CIA director last year he was somebody that was hinting at regime change I want to play a bite for you from him last summer and get you to respond to it it would be a great thing to denuclearize the peninsula to get those weapons off of that but the thing that is most dangerous about it is the character who holds the control over them today and as for the regime I am I'm hopeful we will find a way to separate that regime from this system the North Korean people I'm sure are lovely people would love to see him go obviously if you're in for direct talks Kim jong-un's not going to agree if regime change is on the table why do you think there's been such an about-face in trumps orbit on this issue well I mean as people noticed in North Korea for decades there are not too many great options out there and the idea that you know you'd rather have regime change there look I'd like to have regime change in half the countries in the world you know make them all baseball fans and and it would be easy but the first question and regime change is how are you going to do that and then usually the advocates fall SATA fall silent the second question is going to be and then what who do you have in mind that's better and again there's silence so it's usually a non-issue a kind of throwaway line where you try to show off tough you are right and at this point it's been kind of discredited and so I don't think it was a lot of people paid attention to it I think it's just a way of not dealing with the tough issues of North Korea let me ask you about the idea of choosing Pompeo to do this I had somebody say that in some ways the only way to have any sort of fruitful communication with the North Koreans is through intelligence channels not diplomatic ones well we have the problem today of having diplomacy without too many diplomats so I'm not sure the option of I'm not sure the option of going through the State Department was really going to work right in the meantime I think the CIA has had contacts over the years in you know with the North Koreans and the CIA even the director of the CIA is able to move without a press entourage without too much publicity so these kinds of things have been done in the past just not with North Korea so I can understand the logic of it and by the way we're getting within weeks of all this and it wasn't it's a it's still not clear when this thing is going to be or where this thing's going to be but I think one question that has been answered is it's going to be yes it is going to be obviously the South Koreans and the North Koreans are going to meet first we've already had Kim jong-un and the Chinese meet let me ask it's it's interesting the president yesterday seemed to give permission to South Korea to negotiate the end of the Korean War is the Chinese going to give the same permission well I'm not really sure what the president means by that for for starters the South Korea South Koreans did not sign that armistice we sign the armistice so I'm not sure we can just say okay over to you so I think we need to be a part of that process and this issue has come up before I mean we discussed this back in 2005 now and this is part of the idea that North Korea would like to see a peace treaty to replace this kind of elaborate ceasefire that we have but I think it's it's a very complex issue and it's going to involve the u.s. directly at the table and the Chinese directly at the table so I'm not sure this idea that we can say to the South Koreans hey if you could sort this out that would be great we're hearing that supposedly the North Koreans are willing to discuss denuclearization do you believe them you know the problem is there I think they are willing to discuss denuclearization but the question is the time frame I mean do they have in mind a concept when the lion's lie down with lambs you know and that is at the end of days we'll do this or do they have a concept that we have to somehow abrogate our alliance with the South Koreans I think those are the two issues timeframe and what looks what the u.s. south korean alliance would look like that's what i think is the issue when people talk about the definition of denuclearization it's really the cost or what they're looking for in in in return for denuclearization right before i let you go as a former diplomat what did you make of this spat between ambassador hailey and what she thought was policy then sort of getting pulled back and and it was done in such a way that she clearly took it as an insult and it was a back and forth I know ambassadors sometimes get thrown under the bus a lot by my bosses so is that how you saw it or is there something more problematic here yeah I mean ambassadors do sometimes get thrown under the bus you know it sounds like a great job except you do have a lot of tread marks on you from time to time but I don't know my reaction was not so much former diplomat it's just you know go girl go I mean that was the right response and she did it quickly and made it very clear no she's not going to allow them to pull that kind of nonsense of any diplomats to know over years I have a feeling that you might have had the same response to somebody you-you-you-you you're somebody that wouldn't have taken kindly to to being thrown in the bus I imagine that's true there are enough buses out there anyway you just didn't need that one fair enough ambassador Chris Hill as always sir thanks for coming on sharing your views and your expertise thank you hey there I'm Chris
