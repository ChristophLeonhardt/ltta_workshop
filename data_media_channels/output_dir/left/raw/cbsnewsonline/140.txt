00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:02,968
AMERICA THAT VALUES CHILDREN 

2
00:00:02,968 --> 00:00:10,943
AND FAMILIES AND THE FREEDOM TO 

3
00:00:10,943 --> 00:00:13,379
BE WHO WE ARE?  

4
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:16,448
AND LET'S NOT FORGET OUR

00:00:16,448 --> 00:00:17,951
CITIZEN CHILDREN AND CITIZEN 

6
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:24,090
CHILDREN OF COLOR WHOSE LIVES 

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,757
ARE THREATENED EVERY DAY FOR 

8
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:27,694
REASONS BEYOND IMMIGRATION

00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:27,961
STATUS.  

10
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:31,197
AS ONE WHO HAS SEEN FIRSTHAND I 

11
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:31,998
HAVE TAUGHT MYSELF TO HAVE 

12
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:32,698
HOPE.  

13
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:36,035
I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS 

14
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:41,307
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IS TO RISE 

15
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:41,807
ABOVE THE TYRANNY, THE 

16
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:42,642
IGNORANCE, THE MALPRACTICE AND 

17
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:43,376
BELIEVE IN CHANGE.  

18
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:51,284

ABOVE DIVISION AND FEAR. 

21
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:57,690
ONLY THEN CAN WE STOP THE 

22
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,993
SEPARATION OF FAMILIES AND STOP 

23
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:04,863
THE POLICY THAT PLACES CHILDREN 

24
00:01:04,863 --> 00:01:06,332
IN CAGES.  

25
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:11,171

WE MARCH TO THE POLLS AND

REMEMBER OUR ANGER AND THE 

34
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,726
OUTRAGE AND DESIRE TO ACT. 

35
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:37,696
REMEMBER IN NOVEMBER THAT THE 

36
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:41,166
END TO THESE CRUEL POLICIES 

37
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:46,072

>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 

43
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:04,456
PASSIONATE PROTESTS AND 

44
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:07,694
SPEECHES.  

45
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,630
THIS ONE WAS BY DIANE GUERRERO 

46
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,431
WHOSE PARENTS WERE DEPORTED.  

47
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:16,135
SHE IS THE ACTRESS FOR THE NEW 

48
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:19,305
ORANGE IN BLACK.

I WANT TO BRING IN LINDA TREND 

50
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:22,141
A FOUNDING PARTNER OF NEW

STRATEGIES.  

52
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:23,710
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE 

53
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,413
SENSE OF THE MOVE AND DO YOU 

54
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,115
BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO 

55
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:29,482
SOMETHING MORE? 

56
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,583
>> THANKS, REENA.  

57
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,952
I AGREED TO BE WITH YOU.  

58
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,720
HOW I WOULD ENCAPSULATE THE 

59
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,654
DAY, THE MESSAGE WAS CLEAR BUT 

60
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:37,523
A COMBINATION MESSAGE.  

61
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:42,428
ON THE ONE HAND A LOT OF ANGER 

62
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,330
AND A DISCUSSION OF ELECTORAL 

63
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:44,863
CONSEQUENCES AND VOTE IN 

64
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:46,498
NOVEMBER AND DUMP TRUMP AND 

65
00:02:46,498 --> 00:02:51,004
THERE WAS A CLEAR MESSAGE OF 

66
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,706
LOVE AND HOPE AS WELL.  

67
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,207
YOU WOULD SEE SIGNED THAT SAID 

68
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:56,809
IMMIGRANTS WELCOME HERE.  

69
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,245
JUST HAVING FAMILIES, A FAMILY 

70
00:02:59,245 --> 00:02:59,679
AFFAIR.  

71
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,480
THERE WERE BABIES AND SMALL 

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,948
CHILDREN.  

73
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:02,815
BRAVING THE HEAT TO SAY YOUR 

74
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:05,351
FAMILY IS JUST LIKE MINE AND WE 

75
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:05,751
WELCOME YOU HERE.

SIDE WITH YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT 

78
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:12,257
AFTER THE INAUGURATION AT THE 

79
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:14,327
WOMEN'S MARCH IN CAPITOL HILL.  

80
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,895
WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY RALLYING 

81
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:18,964
CRIES DURING THE 18 MONTHS THE 

82
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:19,565
PRESIDENT'S ADMINISTRATION.  

83
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:21,534
DO YOU GET A SENSE THAT 

84
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,304
IMMIGRATION COULD LEAD TO 

85
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,106
LARGER MOVEMENT. 

86
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,575
IS THERE ENOUGH MOMENTUM AND 

87
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:30,476
COULD IT AFFECT MIDTERMS? 

88
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,343
>> I WOULD ARGUE THAT REFORM 

89
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:36,215
MOVEMENT HAS EXISTED FOR QUITE 

90
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:39,919
A WHILE AND YOU SEE PEAKS AND 

91
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,354
VALLEYS DEPENDING ON WHO IS IN 

92
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:43,890
AUGUST AND IT IS DRIVEN FROM 

93
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,527
THE PROGRESSIVE SIDE.  

94
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,428
THIS WHOLE CRISIS AT THE 

95
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,529
BORDER, THE FAMILY SEPARATION 

96
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:50,129
ISSUE CLEARLY CONCERNS PEOPLE 

97
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,366
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE IN A 

98
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,269
WAY THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN A 

99
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:56,569
LONG TIME. 

100
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,303
NOT SINCE DURING THE BUSH 

101
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,671
ADMINISTRATION TO BE HONEST.  

102
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,507
I THINK THERE IS A SENSE 

103
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,343
CERTAINLY AMONG PROGRESSIVE 

104
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,012
ACTIVISTS AND ALSO I WOULD SAY 

105
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,781
MODERATES THAT THERE IS AN 

106
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,748
OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR CONTINUED 

107
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:10,916
ORGANIZING -- CONTINUAL 

108
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:15,521
MOMENTUM FOR THE MIDTERM 

109
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,022
ELECTION. 

110
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:20,093
>> WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING FOR 

111
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,928
LYNDA FOR THE COMING UP 

112
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:24,396
PROCEEDINGS, WE KNOW TYPICAL 

113
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:28,167
MIDTERMS IS A LESSER TURNOUT, 

114
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:28,768
WHAT ARE DEMOCRATS WATCHING? 

115
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,303
>> DEMOCRATS ARE REELING FROM 

116
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,104
THE SUPREME COURT CASES THAT 

117
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:34,573
CAME OUT LAST WEEK AND ALSO THE 

118
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:35,174
RETIREMENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF 

119
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,744
JUSTICE KENNEDY.  

120
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,545
THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT 

121
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:40,179
ACROSS THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT 

122
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,814
LARGE GROUPS AND SMALL GROUPS 

123
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:42,381
ARE RIGHT NOW STRATEGIZING 

124
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:43,116
ABOUT THE RIGHT APPROACH TO 

125
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:43,649
PUSH BACK.  

126
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:46,519
I THINK WHAT WE WILL END UP 

127
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:52,024
SEEING IS A LOT OF ON 

128
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:56,462
DISCUSSION ESPECIALLY LED BY 

129
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:01,567
WOMEN'S GROUPS ABOUT THE 

130
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:08,007
POSSIBILITY OF ROW V WADE BEING 

131
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,843
OVERTURNED THE AFFORDABLE CARE 

132

A WEEK ON MONDAY JULY 9th. 

143
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,157
THE PRESIDENT IS IN NEW JERSEY 

144
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:26,526
THIS WEEKEND BUT HE MAY START 

145
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,427
MEETING WITH CANDIDATES THERE 

146
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:35,000
AND HE SAYS IT IS DOWN TO A 

147
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,640
LIST OF FIVE INCLUDING TWO 

148
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,040
WOMEN. 

149
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,545
CBS NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT BRETT 

150
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,413
CAVANAUGH AND AMY BARRETT ARE 

151
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:52,552
THE TWO POSSIBLE CANDIDATES.  

152
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,021
IT IS BECAUSE OF ANTHONY 

153
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:55,655
KENNEDY RETIREMENT.  

154
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:56,389
DURING AN INTERVIEW, PRESIDENT 

155
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,324
TRUMP DISCUSSED HOW HE WOULD 

156
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,527
APPROACH THE TOPIC WITH HIS 

157
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,063
NOMINEE. 

158
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,065
>> ARE YOU GOING TO ASK YOUR 

159
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:06,665
NOMINEES BEFOREHAND HOW THEY 

160
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:08,801
MIGHT VOTES ON ROE VERSUS WADE. 

161
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:09,701
>> THAT IS A BIG ONE.  

162
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:10,202
PROBABLY NOT.  

163
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:10,669
YOU DON'T DO THAT.  

164
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,638
YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT IS WHAT I 

165
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:19,912
HAVE BEEN TOLD BUT I AM PUTTING 

166
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:28,120
CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE ON AND I AM 

167
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,292
PROUD OF NEAL GORSCH.  

168
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:40,900
BUT I DON'T THINK I WILL BE 

169
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,167
SPECIFIC. 

170
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:41,734
>> WE HAVE NYL ES STANDIC. 

171
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:46,972
WHOEVER THE PRESIDENT PICKS HOW 

172
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:48,307
DO YOU SEE THE CONFIRMATION 

173
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:48,574
PROCESS? 

174
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,409
>> CLEARLY WHOEVER THE 

175
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:50,943
PRESIDENT PICKS WILL BE 

176
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:51,944
STRONGLY OPPOSED BY THE 

177
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:52,745
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.  

178
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,347
THE PROBLEM FOR DEMOCRATS THEY 

179
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,048
DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS ON THEIR 

180
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,417
OWN TO THWART THE NOMINATION.  

181
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,152
MITCH MCCONNELL, THE REPUBLICAN 

182
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:01,820
LEADER HAS SUGGESTED THAT HIS 

183
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,422
PARTY WILL PRESS ON PROMPTLY 

184
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:07,093
THAT THE CONFIRMATION COULD BE 

185
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,160
COMPLETED BY THE FALL.  

186
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,164
SO THAT'S THE GENERAL BACK DROP 

187
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:18,037
BUT THIS IS A BATTLAL ROYALE 

188
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,939
BETWEEN NOT JUST THE 

189
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,240
POLITICIANS BUT THE ACTIVIST. 

190
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,545
>>> HANGING OVER THE MUELLER 

191
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:35,754
PRBE, WE KNOW THERE IS ONE 

192
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:36,255
POTENTIAL NOMINEE BRETT 

193
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:36,855
KAVANAUG H ARE THERE FACTORS 

194
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:37,256
THERE? 

195
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,892
>> I DON'T THINK IT IS A FACTOR 

196
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,893
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT IF HE 

197
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:45,197
GOT THE NOMINATION THAT WOULD 

198
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:45,764
BE SOMETHING THAT DEMOCRATS 

199
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:47,166
WOULD DRAW ATTENTION TO.  

200
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,468
AS WITH THE TRUMP ERA, WE ARE 

201
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,137
IN A UNIQUE SITUATION HERE, 

202
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,838
CLEARLY THE SUPREME COURT 

203
00:07:52,838 --> 00:08:00,212
JUSTICE COULD HAVE A ROLE TO 

204
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:02,381
PLAY IN A ADJUDICATING THINGS 

205
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,149
WHETHER INDICTMENTS CAN BE 

206
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:06,152
BROUGHT AGAINST A SITTING 

207
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,453
PRESIDENT AND THAT IS DEEP 

208
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,053
WATER POLITICALLY AND THAT IS 

209
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:08,520
WHERE WE ARE SAILING. 

210
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,256
>>> AND CHANGES AT THE WHITE 

211
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,356
HOUSE, THERE IS TALK THAT 

212
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:13,693
PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN 

213
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,962
KELLY MAY BE ON HIS WAY OUT. 

214
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:16,695
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD? 

215
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,598
>> MY REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT 

216
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,600
COULD BE QUITE IMMINENT, EVEN 

217
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,168
PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SO 

218
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:23,969
SKEPTICAL OR CRITICAL OF JOHN 

219
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,971
KELLY HAVE BEEN TELLING ME THAT 

220
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:27,973
THEY THINK THE END MAY BE NEAR 

221
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:28,441
FOR HIS TENURE.  

222
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,608
AND, OF COURSE, MR. KELLY 

223
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:31,944
HIMSELF HAS SAID THAT HE WAS 

224
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,547
BASICALLY PLANNING TO STAY A 

225
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,549
YEAR WHICH IS ALMOST UP. 

226
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,917
AND IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL 

227
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:44,756
SUCCESSORS, THE TWO NAMES WE 

228
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:49,428
HEAR ARE MICK MUL VAINY, THE 

229
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,331
BUDGET DIRECTOR AND NICK AYRES, 

230
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,099
CURRENTLY CHIEF OF STAFF. 

231
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,966
>> WE HAVE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT 

232
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:57,102
OBAMA THAT WAS AT A FUNDRAISER 

233
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:58,604
IN BEVERLY HILLS.  

234
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,640
DO YOU THINK THAT HIS PRESENCE 

235
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,340
WILL HELP DEMOCRATS?  

236
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,010
IT DID NOT TRANSLATE DURING HIS 

237
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,443
PRESIDENTIAL YEARS. 

238
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:08,748
>> YEAH, YOU MAKE A FAIR POINT 

239
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:09,681
THAT A LOT BARACK OBAMA'S 

240
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:11,817
POPULARITY WAS PERSONAL AND HE 

241
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,552
COULDN'T PASS IT ON TO HIS 

242
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,454
PARTY IN MIDTERM ELECTIONS BUT 

243
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,324
HE IS A MAGNETIC FIGURE, EVEN 

244
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,658
HIS OPPONENTS AND CRITICS WOULD 

245
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:23,028
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE IS A GIFTED 

246
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:26,098
ORATOR AND HAS THE CAPACITY TO 

247
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:26,698
INSPIRE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY 

248
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:28,000
AND THE DEMOCRATIC GRASSROOTS 

249
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,537
SO IF I WERE A DEMOCRAT I WOULD 

250
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,839
PREFER HAVING HIM ON MY SIDE 

251
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,472
THAN VARIOUS OTHER MEMBERS OF 

252
00:09:34,472 --> 00:09:34,773
THE PARTY. 

253
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:36,074
>> AND TURNING TO NORTH KOREA, 

254
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:38,410
IT HAS BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE THE 

255
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,411
SUMMIT BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT 

256
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:41,514
AND THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER.  

257
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,148
SINCE THEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS 

258
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,884
HE IS NO LONGER A NUCLEAR 

259
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:45,484
THREAT BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE 

260
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,485
THAT THERE IS INCREASING 

261
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,754
PRODUCTION AND HE SAYS THAT THE 

262
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,655
REMAINS OF U.S. SOLDIERS THAT 

263
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:50,556
WERE KILLED IN KOREA HAVE COME 

264
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:51,857
HOME.  

265
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:52,558
THIS IS A NOT TRUE.  

266
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,061
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE 

267
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:55,961
CURRENT STATUS OF THE 

268
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:57,963
NEGOTIATIONS, WHERE DO THEY 

269
00:09:57,963 --> 00:09:58,197
STAND? 

270
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,899
>> THE KEY POINT HERE REALLY IS 

271
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:00,566
THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT PRESIDENT 

272
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:04,937
TRUMP HAS CLAIMED ON WHAT 

273
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:09,808
APPEARS TO BE REALITY.  

274
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:12,344
HE WAS SUGGESTING THAT SUMMIT 

275
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:13,679
WITH KIM JONG-UN HAD SOLVED THE 

276
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,247
PROJECTS BUT THE SATELLITE 

277
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,084
IMAGES SHOWS THAT IS NOT THE 

278
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:18,984
CASE AND THEY COULD BE TRYING 

279
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:21,153
TO BOLTER THE NUCLEAR POWER.  

280
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,188
THAT'S A CLEAR PROBLEM AND I 

281
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,323
THINK THAT WILL CLEARLY HANG 

282
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,257
OVER IN FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS 

283
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:25,824
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND NORTH 

284
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:27,193
KOREA. 

285
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,896
>> DO YOU THINK WITH THE NEW 

286
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:35,935
SATELLITE IMAGES THAT SOMEHOW 

287
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:36,568
THE WHITE HOUSE MAY CHANGE 

288
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:38,871
THEIR TUNE ON THE APPROACH TO 

289
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:39,204
KIM JONG-UN? 

290
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:39,972
>> IT IS POSSIBLE.  

291
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,508
PRESIDENT TRUMP MAY CONSIDER 

292
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,644
THAT EVIDENCE THAT HE MAY HAVE 

293
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:46,278
BEEN MISLED. 

294
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,347
IT COULD HARDEN THE WHITE 

295
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,282
HOUSE'S ACTIONS POTENTIALLY BUT 

296
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:53,385
WE ALL KNOW THAT HOW THE WHITE 

297
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:54,153
HOUSE WILL REACT WITH NORTH 

298
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,587
KOREA IS NOT KNOWN. 

299
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:56,388
>> WE WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT 

300
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:56,855
WITH NORTH KOREA.  

301
00:10:56,855 --> 00:11:01,494
BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS 

302
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,061
WEEKEND RALLIES ACROSS THE 

303
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,261
COUNTRY AGAINST PRESIDENT 

304
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:04,029
TRUMP'S FAMILY, SEPARATION 

305
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:06,298
POLICY, DO YOU GET A SENSE THAT 

306
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:06,931
IMMIGRATION WILL HELP OR HURT 

307
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:09,768
HIM FOR MID TERMS AND HOW WILL 

308
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:14,206
IT AFFECT THE DEMOCRATS, IS IT 

309
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,008
A RALLY CRY TO GET PEOPLE TO 

310
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,542
GET OUT IN MID TERMS. 

311
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:21,846
>> IT COULD HELP ONE PARTY OR 

312
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:22,380
ANOTHER DEPENDING ON THE 

313
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,983
DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE DISTRICT 

314
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,750
BUT THE ISSUE HOW THEY ARE 

315
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,284
PROTESTING DOES HURT THE 

316
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:27,353
REPUBLICAN PARTY TO SOME 

317
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:27,653
EXTENT. 

318
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:32,858
THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE SEE 

319
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,559
SOMETIMES IN POLITICS REENA 

320
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,060
THAT HAS EMOTIONAL RESONANCE 

321
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,197
BEYOND A REGULAR NEWS STORY.  

322
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,299
I THINK THE VERY VISCERAL IDEA 

323
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,701
OF SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM 

324
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:43,301
THEIR PARENTS, DOES HIT HOME 

325
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:45,004
WITH PEOPLE.  

326
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,372
I THINK THAT REACHES FRANKLY 

327
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,639
PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT FOLLOWING 

328
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,176
EVERY TWIST AND TURN IN

UNDERSTANDABLE AVERSIO TO THAT 

331
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,811
KIND OF TREATMENT. 

332
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:54,480

333
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,414

DEPENDABLE.

JUST A SUITER THAT IS A 

372
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:27,506
REFERENCE TO JUSTICE SUITER 

373
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:28,741
NOMINATED BY PRESIDENT HERBERT 

374
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,377
BUSCH AND MOVED TO THE LEFT 

375
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,512
COMPARED TO WHAT REPUBLICANS 

376
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:33,779
WANTED.  

377
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,014
I THINK WE WILL SEE TWO 

378
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:37,449
PREDICTABLE JURISTS THAT WILL 

379
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,116
BE COMPARATIVELY FAR TO THE 

380
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:39,185
RIGHT OF JUSTICE KENNEDY. 

381
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,788
>> YOU SAY FAR TO THE RIGHT.  

382
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,456
IT WAS ACTUALLY -- KENNEDY WAS 

383
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,957
NOMINATED UNDER PRESIDENT 

384
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:46,558
RONALD REAGAN AT THE TIME.  

385
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:49,728
DO YOU GET A SENSE AND FEEL 

386
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,830
STRONGLY THAT THIS WILL AFFECT 

387
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,798
THE MAKEUP OF THE SUPREME 

388
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:53,031
COURT? 

389
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:54,533
>> I ABSOLUTELY DO.  

390
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,836
AND I THINK THAT IT IS 

391
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,905
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER JUSTICE 

392
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,008
KENNEDY WAS NOBODY'S LIBERAL 

393
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:03,976
JURIST.  

394
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,811
HE WAS A CONSERVATIVE JURIST 

395
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:06,478
BUT MODERATE AND HE DID VOTE 

396
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,679
WITH THE CONSERVATIVE WING OF 

397
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,581
THE COURT BUT IN A FEW KEY 

398
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:10,783
ISSUES HE DIDN'T.  

399
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,451
AND THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT 

400
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,187
LIBERALS ARE WORRIED ABOUT.  

401
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,090
GAY RIGHTS, HE WAS THE ONE THAT 

402
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,793
AUTHORED THE OPINION THAT 

403
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:21,427
LEGALIZED SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IN 

404
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,595
THE AREA OF ABORTION IN THE 

405
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:24,996
AREA OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, IN 

406
00:14:24,996 --> 00:14:26,932
SOME CRIMINAL JUSTICE AREAS.  

407
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:27,999
SO IN THE ONE HAND WE CAN SEE 

408
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:31,503
QUITE CLEARLY THAT HE WAS THE 

409
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,604
SWING VOTE IN THOSE HOT BUTTON 

410
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:33,706
ISSUES. 

411
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,309
ALSO I THINK WAYS KIND OF UNDER 

412
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,743
REPORTED THAT BEHIND THE SCENES 

413
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:39,979
JUSTICE KENNEDY HAD A 

414
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:40,446
MODERATING EFFECT.  

415
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,581
THERE WERE DECISIONS AND WE 

416
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:47,186
COULD LOOK TO THE LESS TWO 

417
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,186
WEEKS THAT WERE NARROWER OF 

418
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:52,191
WHAT WAS A MAJORITY OF THE 

419
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:52,424
POINT.  

420
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,493
WE COULD USE TO THE MASTERPIECE 

421
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:57,062
CAKE SHOP WITH THE COLORADO 

422
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:57,696
BAKER THAT DID NOT WANT TO BAKE 

423
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,564
A CAKE FOR A GAY COUPLE. 

424
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:00,599
IF YOU HAD A CONSERVATIVE 

425
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:06,071
MAJORITY OF THE COURT YOU MAY 

426
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,907
HAVE A BROADER DECISION THAT 

427
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:09,507
EMBRACES RELIGIOUS OBJECTORS 

428
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:10,209
BEING ABLE TO SAY TO GAY 

429
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,311
COUPLES I WILL NOT MAKE A CAKE 

430
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,879
FOR YOU AND THE SAME WITH 

431
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,014
GERRYMANDERING, IN BOTH CASES 

432
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,716
WE HAD NO DECISION IN LARGE 

433
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:21,920
PART BECAUSE OF JUSTICE 

434
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,187
KENNEDY. 

435
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,790
WHAT WE MIGHT SEE ARE BIGGER 

436
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,190
BOLDER DECISIONS. 

437
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:25,724
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 

438
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:26,458
FRAMEWORK OF THE U.S. SUPREME 

439
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:26,992
COURT.  

440
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:31,864
WHAT DO YOU SAY WHEN THEY SAY 

441
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:32,431
IT IS TILTED TOWARDS THE 

442
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:32,865
CONSERVATIVE SIDE? 

443
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,333
>> WELL I WOULD SAY A COUPLE OF 

444
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,433
THINGS, ONE THAT IS NOT THE 

445
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:38,537
CASE, WE HAVE TO TAKE A BROADER 

446
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:43,141
VIEW AND IT IS NOT ALWAYS 

447
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:43,808
TILTED TOWARDSTHE CONSERVATIVE 

448
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:48,313
TIME AND WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL 

449
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:48,880
ABOUT CONSERVATIVE VERSUS 

450
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,147
LIBERAL. 

451
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:51,016
>> IS THERE A DIFFERENCE 

452
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:51,817
BETWEEN SAYING SOMEBODY IS 

453
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,751
CONSERVATIVE AS IN REPUBLICAN 

454
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:53,885
OR IS THERE A DIFFERENT TAKE ON 

455
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:57,322
IT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SORT OF 

456
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:59,491
A LEGAL TERM OF CONSERVATIVE? 

457
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,125
>> WELL THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. 

458
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,861
THERE SHOULD BE A DIFFERENCE 

459
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:03,628
BUT WHAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS 

460
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:07,833
SEEING NOW THAT IT LOOKS LIKE 

461
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,467
THE JUDGES ARE VOTING ACCORDING 

462
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,269
TO WHO NOMINATED THEM P IF A 

463
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:11,903
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT NOMINATED 

464
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:14,907
THEM THEY ARE UPHOLDING THE 

465
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:15,507
CAUSES THAT REPUBLICANS CARE 

466
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,108
ABOUT.  

467
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,743
IF DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT 

468
00:16:18,743 --> 00:16:19,344
NOMINATED THEM THEN THEY ARE 

469
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:20,913
DOING THE OPPOSITE.  

470
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:24,216
BUT THERE IS AND SHOULD BE A 

471
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,918
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONSERVATIVE 

472
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:26,685
LEGAL SCHOLAR AND CONSERVATIVE 

473
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,119
POLITICIAN.  

474
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,187
THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE 

475
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,421
CURRENT CONSERVATIVE COURT IS 

476
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:31,390
FAR TO THE RIGHT OF PAST 

477
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,457
CONSERVATIVE COURTS SO I 

478
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:34,393
BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL BE THE 

479
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:38,330
MOST CONSERVATIVE COURT WE HAVE 

480
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,931
SEEN SINCE THE EARLY 1930S.  

481
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:42,434
YOU COULD HAVE A COURT THAT 

482
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,034
LEANS CONSERVATIVE BUT THIS 

483
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:44,803
COURT IS SO MUCH -- THE CENTER 

484
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,571
OF THE COURT IS FURTHER TO THE 

485
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:48,107
RIGHT OF ANYTHING THAT ANYONE 

486
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,007
IN THIS GENERATION HAS SEEN. 

487
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,375
>> SO THE SUPREME COURT WILL 

488
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,010
NOW BE NEXT IN SESSION COME 

489
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,011
OCTOBER AND THE PRESIDENT SAYS 

490
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:53,812
HE WANTS TO SEAT SOMEONE BY 

491
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:54,213
THEN.  

492
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,014
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CASES ARE 

493
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:58,817
THAT THEY COULD TAKE UP THAT 

494
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,552
COULD BE IMPACTED BY A MORE 

495
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,120
CONSERVATIVE COURT? 

496
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,021
>> WELL, I THINK THAT YOU KNOW 

497
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:03,921
IF YOU LOOK AT THE AREAS OF 

498
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:05,455
VOTING RIGHTS, THIS IS A BIG 

499
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:08,093
AREA FOR THE COURT, IF YOU LOOK 

500
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,262
AT ISSUES RELATED TO OBVIOUSLY 

501
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,496
GUN CONTROL IS A BIG ISSUE, IF 

502
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:15,166
YOU LOOK AT RELIGIOUS RIGHTS, 

503
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,335
IF YOU LOOK AT ANTI 

504
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,637
DISCRIMINATION LAWS, IF YOU 

505
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,503
LOOK AT ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS, 

506
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:22,840
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS, ALL 

507
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:28,814
OF THOSE THINGS ARE LIKELY TO 

508
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,716
BE DECIDED IN THE COMING TERMS. 

509
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,717
THEY HAVE GRANTED 

510
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,218
CERTIFICATIONS IN A NUMBER OF 

511
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:33,852
CASES AND DEALING WITH CRIMINAL 

512
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:34,720
JUSTICE.  

513
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,224
WE COULD SEE A DIFFERENT MAKEUP 

514
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,325
OF THE COURT AND DIFFERENT 

515
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,527
DECISIONS IF WE TALK NEXT YEAR 

516
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,528
AT THIS TIME. 

517
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,229
THESE ARE AREAS THAT AFFECT -- 

518
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,999
MOST OF US ARE AFFECTED BY ONE 

519
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,902
OF THESE AREAS AT LEAST ON A 

520
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:51,269
DAILY BASIS. 

521
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:51,904

522
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,073
DIVERSITY BY GENDER AND RACE.

WOULD BE LIKE PUTTING A STICK 

613
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,771
IN A BEEHIVE.

CAME BACK AND THEY DID NOT KNOW 

739
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:40,178
ABOUT THE KILLING AND HE COULD 

740
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,179
BE HERE BUT THERE'S NO WARNINGS 

741
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:41,680
OR ANYTHING.  

742
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,316
YOU KIND OF HAVE TO FIND OUT ON 

743
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:44,616
YOUR OWN. 

744
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:45,717
>> THE CAMP GROUND IS CLOSED 

745
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,518
INDEFINITELY BUT THE REST OF 

746
00:24:47,518 --> 00:24:50,288
THE PARK IS STILL OPEN AND 

747
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,156
BEYOND THE LACK OF WARNINGS 

748
00:24:52,156 --> 00:24:54,058
THERE IS FRUSTRATION AMONG THE 

749
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:54,658
SHOOTING VICTIMS.  

750
00:24:54,658 --> 00:24:56,795
THEY FEEL LIKE THE INITIAL 

751
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:59,397
REPORTS WERE NOT TAKEN 

752
00:24:59,397 --> 00:24:59,697
SERIOUSLY.

MADE COULD IT LEAD TO A CRISIS. 

770

DAVID JOINS US NOW TO DISCUSS 

771
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:41,893

>> BREAK DOWN YOUR ARGUMENT HOW 

774
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,431

PICK TURN INTO A CONSTITUTIONAL 

776
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:48,933
CRISIS. 

777
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,201
>> OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW 

778
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,704
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION WILL 

779
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:58,009
TURN OUT AND WHAT IT WILL FIND. 

780
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,678
BUT IF IT FINDS THAT THERE WAS 

781
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:01,212
COLLUSION OR OUT RIGHT 

782
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:01,913
CONSPIRACY.  

783
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:02,480
THE CONSTITUTION GIVES US 

784
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,682
REMEDIES FOR WHAT YOU DO.  

785
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,984
YOU CAN VOTE OUT A PRESIDENT OR 

786
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,519
VOTE OUT LEGISLATURES.  

787
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,387
IT DOES NOT GIVE US REMEDIES 

788
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:15,927
FOR WHAT TO DO WITH JUSTICES 

789
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:16,527
APPOINTED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES 

790
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:18,029
THAT WE NOW KNOW WHICH IN THIS 

791
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:18,863
CASE WERE TOTALLY LEGITIMATE.  

792
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,764
WE WOULD HAVE TO AS A COUNTRY 

793
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:25,270
FIGURE IT OUT AND IT WILL BE 

794
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,004
DIFFICULT AND THREATEN THE 

795
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,005
INTEGRITY OF THE JUDICIARY. 

796
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,173
>> THE REPUBLICANS HAVE THE 

797
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:30,008
VOTING POWER AND WANT TO PUSH 

798
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,009
IT FORWARD.  

799
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:34,112
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING CHANGING IF 

800
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,713
THEY WANT TO GET SOMEONE IN 

801
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:36,213
THERE BEFORE MIDTERMS? 

802
00:28:36,213 --> 00:28:37,215
>> I SUSPECT THAT MITCH 

803
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,416
MCCONNELL IS NOT WATCHING THIS 

804
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,918
INTERVIEW WAITING TO HEAR WHAT 

805
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,986
I THINK HE SHOULD DO.  

806
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:46,925
I THINK HE WILL GO AS FAST AS 

807
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:47,926
HE CAN.  

808
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:54,932
HE WILL RAM THIS THROUGH.  

809
00:28:54,932 --> 00:28:56,234
DON'T FORGET NEAL GORSCH WAS 

810
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,635
RAMMED THROUGH.  

811
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,136
HOWEVER WE COULD SET OURSELVES 

812
00:28:59,136 --> 00:29:04,008
UP FOR A SERIOUS CRISIS LIKE 20 

813
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:06,577
YEARS FROM NOW WE ARE SEEING 5-

814
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:08,046
4 EXTREM DECISIONS THAT WE 

815
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,914
KNOW WOULD NOT TAKE PLACE IF IT 

816
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,048
WAS NOT FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN 

817
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:12,016
MEDDLING IN THE ELECTIONS. 

818
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,451
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE THE PEOPLE 

819
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,621
WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT 

820
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,122
KIND OF REPEATED RESHAPING OF 

821
00:29:18,122 --> 00:29:20,058
THE CONSTITUTION NOT JUST FOR A 

822
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,560
FEW YEARS BUT FOR DECADES 

823
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,962
KNOWING IT TO PLACE BECAUSE OF 

824
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,464
A HOSTILE FOREIGN POWER IF THAT 

825
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:30,602
IS WHAT WE FIND OUT. 

826
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,903
>> THE SUPREME COURT HAVE BEEN 

827
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,037
REVIEWED AS BIPARTISAN 

828
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:33,304
POLITICS. 

829
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:33,871
DO YOU THINK THIS IS A 

830
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:35,306
POLITICAL PROCESS AND HOW DO 

831
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,808
YOU CHANGE IT, IF THIS IS THE 

832
00:29:37,808 --> 00:29:38,610
CASE? 

833
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,510
>> THE SUPREME COURT HAS NEVER 

834
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:43,180
BEEN IMMUNE FROM POLITICS BUT 

835
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,215
BOTH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS 

836
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,351
ALLIS IN CONGRESS FEEL LIKE 

837
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,253
THEY ARE PICKING A NEW TEAM 

838
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:49,520
MEMBER. 

839
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,022
JUSTICE ROBERTS TALKED ABOUT 

840
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,156
HIS ROLE AS UMPIRE CALLING 

841
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:52,957
BALLS AND STRIKES.  

842
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,091
MITCH MCCONNELL FEELS LIKE HE 

843
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:56,193
GOT A DRAFT PICK AND TRUMP FOR 

844
00:29:56,193 --> 00:29:57,261
THE FIRST TIME I BELIEVE FOR A 

845
00:29:57,261 --> 00:29:58,596
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DIDN'T 

846
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,864
JUST TALK ABOUT THE JUSTICE HE 

847
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:02,000
WOULD LIKE TO APPOINT, HE PUT 

848
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,937
OUT A LIST OF JUSTICES THAT HE 

849
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:06,437
MIGHT A POINT. 

850
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,406
THAT'S A NEW ENCROACHMENT OF 

851
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,841
THE POLITICAL PROCESS THAT IS 

852
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,042
SUPPOSED TO BE INDEPENDENT. 

853
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:11,875
THESE ARE CHALLENGING THE 

854
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:16,547
INTEGRITY OF THE COURT LITTLE 

855
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:17,415
BY LITTLE AND THE RUSSIA PROBE 

856
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,082
OBVIOUSLY IF IT FINDS EVIDENCE 

857
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,717
OF SOMETHING MORE SEVERE THAN 

858
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,085
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN, IF THERE IS 

859
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:24,388
FIRE TO GO WITH THE SMOKE IT 

860
00:30:24,388 --> 00:30:25,289
WILL MAKE THINGS WORSE. 

861
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:27,091
>> DAVID, WE ARE SEEING WE THE 

862
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,127
PEOPLE EARLIER AND SEEING FOLKS 

863
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:31,128
TAKEN TO THE STREETS IN CITIES 

864
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:31,863
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY OVER 

865
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:32,964
IMMIGRATION.  

866
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,865
HOW DOES WE THE PEOPLE, THE 

867
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:37,368
FOLKS OUT THERE IN AMERICA 

868
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:38,703
COUNTER A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE 

869
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,738
WHEN YOU KNOW THESE ARE FOLKS 

870
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:42,173
THAT ARE NOMINATED FOR LIFE.  

871
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,243
HOW DOES ANYONE COUNTER THAT ON 

872
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:45,576
THE STREETS. 

873
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:49,247
>> I THINK THAT WE HAVE SEEN 

874
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:49,881
FOR GENERATIONS SUPREME COURTS 

875
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,250
THAT HAVE BEEN OUT OF STEP WITH 

876
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,450
WHAT THE PEOPLE, THE MAJORITY 

877
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,418
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT.  

878
00:30:54,418 --> 00:30:58,489
THE LAST TIME WE HAD A MAJORITY 

879
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,924
OF THE COURT APPOINTED BY 

880
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:00,858
DEMOCRATS 1969, SO MOST 

881
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:07,165
AMERICANS HAVE NEVER BEEN ALIVE 

882
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,666
DURING A TIME WHEN THE COURT 

883
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,768
HAS NOT BEEN CONSENTTIVE.  

884
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:13,638
IT WILL MAKE IT WORSE, IF THE 

885
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:14,872
NEW 5-4 MAJORITY CAME TO BEING 

886
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:15,974
BECAUSE OF VLADIMIR PUTIN THE 

887
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:16,708
NEXT DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION 

888
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,576
WILL PROBABLY BE THINKING ABOUT 

889
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:19,877
WAYS TO REFORM THE COURT AND 

890
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:22,013
MAKE SURE THAT PUTIN'S 

891
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:22,546
INFLUENCE IS NOT FELT FOR 

892
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:22,847
DECADES.  

893
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,048
ONE THING FOR WOE THE PEOPLE, 

894
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,683
THE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS TO BE 

895
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:28,486
WORKING WITHIN THE SYSTEM THAT 

896
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,653
WE GREW UP IN BUT THAT SYSTEM 

897
00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:32,924
DOESN'TNEED TO INCLUDE FOREIGN 

898
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:33,958
POWERS GETTING TO PICK JUSTICES 

899
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,526
FOR LIFE. 

900
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:36,093
>>> DAVID LITT THANKS FOR 

901
00:31:36,093 --> 00:31:37,395
JOINING US WITH YOUR 

902
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,563
PERSPECTIVE ON THE SUPREME 

903
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,263
COURT. 

904
00:31:39,263 --> 00:31:44,969
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

905
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,938
>> AROUND MICHAEL GRAHAM JOINS 

906
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:47,939
US, A CBS JOURNALIST.  

907
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,741
YOU HEARD IT THERE.  

908
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,643
A LOT OF IFS TO DAVID'S COLUMN, 

909
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:53,310
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT IN. 

910
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,478
>> YOU HEAR THE PHRASE WE HAVE 

911
00:31:54,478 --> 00:31:56,313
ONE PRESIDENT AT A TIME AND 

912
00:31:56,313 --> 00:31:58,850
USUALLY THEY ARE REFERRING A 

913
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,517
TRANSITION POINT WHERE ONE IS 

914
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:00,951
GOING IN AND GOING OUT.  

915
00:32:00,951 --> 00:32:02,854
MY COUNTER ARGUMENT IS THAT WE 

916
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:03,721
ARE ENTITLED TO AT LEAST ONE 

917
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:06,157
PRESIDENT AT A TIME.  

918
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,559
IF YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT 

919
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,062
CAN'T DO BASIC THINGS LIKE 

920
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:11,796
NOMINATE SOMEBODY FOR A SUPREME 

921
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,798
COURT VACANCY YOU DON'T HAVE A 

922
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:15,432
PRESIDENT AND THE IDEA TO SAY 

923
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:18,469
ONE DAY THIS PRESIDENT MIGHT BE 

924
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,271
IMPEACHED AND ONE DAY WE MIGHT 

925
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:20,905
DISCOVER THAT HE DID SOMETHING 

926
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:23,240
BAD AND SO HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING 

927
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,278
UNTIL THEN, I DON'T KNOW HOW 

928
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,345
THE SYSTEM WOULD WORK.  

929
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:30,782
THE GLARING OBVIOUS EXAMPLE IS 

930
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,082
RICHARD NIXON, HE WAS FORCED 

931
00:32:32,082 --> 00:32:34,552
OUT OF OFFICE AND APPOINT TWO 

932
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:36,320
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES.  

933
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,056
NOBODY SAID WE CAN'T HAVE 

934
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:38,956
JUSTICE RENQUIST ANYMORE.  

935
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:41,759
NIXON APPOINTED HIM. 

936
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:42,893
THE SYSTEM WORKS AND NOT 

937
00:32:42,893 --> 00:32:44,895
PREDICATED ON EVERY INDIVIDUAL 

938
00:32:44,895 --> 00:32:45,295
BEING PERFECT.  

939
00:32:45,295 --> 00:32:47,999
THE PRESIDENT GETS TO NOMINATE 

940
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,200
SOMEBODY BECAUSE THE REASON WHY 

941
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,972
THE SENATE REVIEWS THEM, THE 

942
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:57,742
SENATE DOES NOT REVIEW A JUDGE 

943
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,343
GORSCH BASED ON DONALD TRUMP.  

944
00:32:59,343 --> 00:33:00,344
DO THEY HAVE THE RIGHT SKILLS.  

945
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:04,081
IF THEY DO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF 

946
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:05,515
THEY ARE NOMINATED BY PRESIDENT 

947
00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:06,283
TRUMP OR PRESIDENT OBAMA OR 

948
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:06,651
SATAN.  

949
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,920
THE SYSTEM WORKS PRETTY GOOD 

950
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,055
AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT DAVID 

951
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:11,889
IS OVERLOOKING. 

952
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:12,957
>> DO YOU HAVE FAITH IN THE 

953
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:13,223
SYSTEM?  

954
00:33:13,223 --> 00:33:19,230
A LOT OF FOLKS LOOK AT THE 

955
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,500
SUPREME COURT HAS INSTITUTION 

956
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,301
THAT SHOULD NOT BE POLITICAL 

957
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,236
BUT FOLKS BELIEVE THAT IT IS.  

958
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:27,338
HOW DO FOLKS AT HOME COUNTER 

959
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:27,838
THAT, MICHAEL. 

960
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:30,341
>> A COUPLE OF THINGS.  

961
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:35,913
I THINK IT IS NAIVE TO THINK 

962
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:38,149
THE COURT IS BECOMING 

963
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,685
POLITICAL.  

964
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,452
IN FDR'S DAY THEY HAD OPINIONS 

965
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,254
OVER THE COURT IN ROE V WADE 

966
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:44,822
THE PEOPLE WERE DIVIDED AND 45 

967
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,291
YEARS LATER PEOPLE ARE DIVIDED 

968
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,126
AND YET THE COURT IS STILL THE 

969
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:49,393
COURT.  

970
00:33:49,393 --> 00:33:52,330
THE NOTION THAT THE COURT IS 

971
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:52,863
SOMEHOW IN A DANGER -- 

972
00:33:52,863 --> 00:33:54,298
INTERESTING POINT IN DAVID'S 

973
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:58,002
PIECE.  

974
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:59,704
WE ARE IN DANGER OF LOSING 

975
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,037
CREDIBILITY. 

976
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:02,073
GALLOP'S NUMBERS, DO YOU FEEL 

977
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,407
CONFIDENT IN THE INSTITUTION, 

978
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:04,041
TODAY ABOUT 40% OF AMERICANS 

979
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,276
FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT ABOUT THE 

980
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,078
SUPREME COURT.  

981
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,779
TEN YEARS AGO THAT WAS DOWN TO 

982
00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:09,179
32%. 

983
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,648
IT HAS GONE UP.  

984
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:13,050
THE SAME WITH THE PRESIDENCY. 

985
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,185
TODAY ABOUT 32% OF AMERICANS 

986
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,485
FEEL CONFIDENTS IN IT AND TEN 

987
00:34:15,485 --> 00:34:18,688
YEARS AGO DOWN TO 25%. 

988
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:25,696
THE POINT IS THAT THE 

989
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,632
COMPETENCE IN THE INSTITUTIONS 

990
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:30,067
EBB AND FLOW DUE TO 

991
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:30,801
PARTISANSHIP.  

992
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:33,504
THERE'S NO REASON TO VACATE A 

993
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:34,138
PRESIDENTIAL'S CONSTITUTIONAL 

994
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,206
POWERS BECAUSE YOU THINK ONE 

995
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,308
DAY SOMEBODY MIGHT FIND OUT HE 

996
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:37,775
DID SOMETHING ICKY. 

997
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,777
>> SO YOU SEE WHOEVER THE 

998
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,445
PRESIDENT NOMINATES TO GO 

999
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:43,813
THROUGH BEFORE AS THE PRESIDENT 

1000
00:34:43,813 --> 00:34:44,315
WANTS BEFORE MIDTERMS? 

1001
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,116
>> LOOK IT.  

1002
00:34:46,116 --> 00:34:47,418
THE PRESIDENT NOMINATES SOMEONE 

1003
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,018
IS LOUSY THE SENATE SHOULD 

1004
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:50,855
REJECT THEM.  

1005
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:51,656
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW THE 

1006
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:57,127
INVESTIGATION COMES OUT. 

1007
00:34:57,127 --> 00:34:59,130
GEORGE

1008
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:05,001
W BUSH NOMINATED  NOMINATE 

1009
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:06,303
HARRIET MYERS. 

1010
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:09,407
AND SHE WAS A HORRIBLE PICK.  

1011
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:13,578
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW 

1012
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:14,611
RELEASING A LIST IS UNDERMINING 

1013
00:35:14,611 --> 00:35:14,811
IT.  

1014
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:15,980
IT IS TRANSPARENT.  

1015
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,583
YOU MAY NOT LIKE PRESIDENT 

1016
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,483
TRUMP'S CHOICE BUT IT WILL BE 

1017
00:35:19,483 --> 00:35:20,184
SOMEONE THOROUGHLY VETTED BY 

1018
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,653
THE SENATE AND THE PUBLIC AND 

1019
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,288
THE MEDIA AND IF THAT PERSON IS 

1020
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,889
QUALIFIED, NO MATTER WHAT 

1021
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,591
HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE, NO 

1022
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,025
MATTER WHAT DIFFERENCE IT WILL 

1023
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:28,292
MAKE.  

1024
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,761
IF YOU BUY THE NOTION THAT 

1025
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:31,395
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT 

1026
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:33,331
CHOICES SHOULD BE VACATED IF HE 

1027
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:34,331
IS LATER CONVICTED OF 

1028
00:35:34,331 --> 00:35:35,800
COLLUSION, WHAT ABOUT THE 

1029
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,333
EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT HE 

1030
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:36,567
SIGNED. 

1031
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,168
WHAT ABOUT THE BILLS THAT HE 

1032
00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:38,435
SIGNED.  

1033
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:40,605
I MEAN WE JUST CAN'T DO A 

1034
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:41,806
PRESIDENCY THIS WAY WHERE IF IT 

1035
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,807
IS RETROACTIVE, SORRY, WE 

1036
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,509
DECIDED WE DON'T LIKE YOU SO WE 

1037
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:47,912
WILL GET RID OF YOUR STUFF.  

1038
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:48,879
OUR SYSTEM IS SPECIFICALLY 

1039
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:50,381
DESIGNED TO BE BIGGER THAN ANY 

1040
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,516
ONE PRESIDENT NO MATTER HOW HE 

1041
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:53,517
OR SHE TURNS OUT TO BEHAVE. 

1042
00:35:53,517 --> 00:35:56,453
>>> MICHAEL, I WANT TO 

1043
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:58,021
HIGHLIGHT, YOU GOT A NEW COLUMN 

1044
00:35:58,021 --> 00:35:59,891
ON MONDAY, YOU SUGGEST THAT 

1045
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:00,591
OPENING MAY BE A BOOM TO 

1046
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:03,093
DEMOCRATS IN MIDTERM.  

1047
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:03,994
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS ONE? 

1048
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:06,831
>> SO IT DEPENDS ON HOW THEY 

1049
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,833
APPROACH IT, THE CHALLENGE THEY 

1050
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,934
HAVE IS KEEPING THEIR TEAM 

1051
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,736
ENERGIZED ABOUT DYING SOMETHING 

1052
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,170
ABOUT THE COURT AND LET'S FACE 

1053
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,872
IT AS YOU HAVE POINTED OUT ON 

1054
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,239
CBSN THEY NOT ONLY HAVE THE 

1055
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,041
VOTES THE REPUBLICANS CAN DO 

1056
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:21,312
WHAT THEY WANT BUT YOU WANT TO 

1057
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:21,945
KEEP THEM ENERGIZED AND WITHOUT 

1058
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:23,281
GOING TO CRAZY.  

1059
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,815
I DON'T THINK THAT GIVING 

1060
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,384
REPUBLICANS A CONSERVATIVE WILL 

1061
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,552
INSPIRE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER AND 

1062
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:30,488
YOU ARE MAKING THEM HAPPY.  

1063
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,390
WHAT MOTIVATES VOTERS IS FEAR 

1064
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,591
OR CONCERN AND SO IF 

1065
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,092
REPUBLICANS ARE GETTING WHAT 

1066
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:35,926
THEY WANT AND DEMOCRATS ARE 

1067
00:36:35,926 --> 00:36:38,362
MAKING THEIR CASE, THEN I THINK 

1068
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:42,032
YOU KIND OF END UP WITH 

1069
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:43,834
DIFFERENT SPLIT BUT IF 

1070
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,636
DEMOCRATS DRIFT OVER TO OVERLY 

1071
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:46,003
ZEALOUS. 

1072
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,539
MORE INCIDENTS OF PEOPLE BEING 

1073
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,775
THROWN OUT OF RESTAURANTS AND 

1074
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:54,178
THE MARCHING TURNS FROM 

1075
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:57,081
ANIMATED TO UGLY IT MAKES 

1076
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,249
VOTERS NERVOUS. 

1077
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,683
IF THESE CRAZIES GET IN POWER 

1078
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:01,218
WE WILL SPEND TWO YEARS 

1079
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:02,987
FIGHTING OFF CRAZINESS AND 

1080
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,554
THAT'S THE SWEET SPOT DEMOCRATS 

1081
00:37:04,554 --> 00:37:06,190
ARE LOOKING FOR.  

1082
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,925
ENERGIZED BUT NOT OVER THE TOP. 

1083
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,359
>> WE KNOW MIDTERMS ARE HARD TO 

1084
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:09,894
GET TURNOUTS.  

1085
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,929
INTERESTING TO HEAR YOUR 

1086
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,564
ARGUMENT THAT IT COULD MAKE A 

1087
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,066
DIFFERENCE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC 

1088
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:16,567
PARTY.  

1089
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,568
MICHAEL GRAHAM, THANK YOU FOR 

1090
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:17,868
YOUR TIME. 

1091
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:18,536
>>> MY PLEASURE, THANK YOU. 

1092
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,304
>>> COMING UP AFTER A BREAK. 

1093
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:23,006
HOT OUT THERE FOR MUCH OF 

1094
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:23,574
COUNTRY AND OFFICIALS ARE 

1095
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,642
WARNING THAT IT COULD BE 

1096
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:27,111
DANGERS. 

1097
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,079
>> AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 

1098
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:29,713
FIGHTING MULTIPLE BATTLES FROM 

1099
00:37:29,713 --> 00:37:31,816
HIS GOLF RESORT IN NEW JERSEY 

1100
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,017
AS THOUSANDS MARCH AGAINST HIS 

1101
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,920

WAS SURPRISED AT HOW EASY IT

00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:15,859
WAS TO GET THROUGH TO PRESIDENT 

1206
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,861
TRUMP AND HOW HE SAYS PRESIDENT 

1207
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:18,928
TRUMP SEEMED TO BELIEVE THAT HE 

1208
00:43:18,928 --> 00:43:20,164

1209
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:23,367

SENATOR MA  -- WAS THE SENATOR. 

1214
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,523
IT SOUNDS CONVINCING.  

1215
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:47,657
NOW THE SECRET SERVICE HAS 

1216
00:43:47,657 --> 00:43:50,527
VISITED HIS HOUSE AND HE DID 

1217
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,996
NOT VISIT THE DOOR AND IN 

1218
00:43:52,996 --> 00:43:55,399
DISCUSSION WITH AN ATTORNEY 

1219
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:56,199
THAT ALSO REPRESENTS STORMY 

1220
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:57,401
DANIELS SHOULD THE WHITE HOUSE 

1221
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,503
DECIDE TO PRESS CHARGES AND 

1222
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:02,039
THIS COMEDIAN SAYS IT WAS HIM 

1223
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,340
AND GOAT THROUGH THE PRESIDENT. 

1224
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,243
>> I'M CURIOUS WHAT THE WHITE 

1225
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:07,544
HOUSE IS SAYING ABOUT THIS. 

1226
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:08,044
>> THIS IS EXCEEDINGLY 

1227
00:44:08,044 --> 00:44:09,246
EMBARRASSING FOR THE WHITE 

1228
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,081
HOUSE AND THEY HAVE NOT 

1229
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:11,381
COMMENTED. 

1230
00:44:11,381 --> 00:44:15,886
THEY TOLD US THEY WON'T ENGAGE 

1231
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,489
ON THIS TOPIC BUT THEY ALSO NOT 

1232
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,222
FORCEFULLY DENIED IT THAT WE 

1233
00:44:19,222 --> 00:44:20,423
HAVE SEEN WITH PREVIOUS 

1234
00:44:20,423 --> 00:44:21,491
INCIDENTS.  

1235
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:23,160
WE DID GET CONFIRMATION FROM A 

1236
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:23,660
PERSON FAMILIAR WITH 

1237
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,196
CONVERSATIONS FROM THE WHITE 

1238
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:29,900
HOUSE ON THURSDAY AND DID REACH 

1239
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,501
OUT TO SENATOR MENENDEZ'S 

1240
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,070
OFFICE TO FLAG THIS PRANK PHONE 

1241
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,237
CALL TO THE PRESIDENT TO THE 

1242
00:44:34,237 --> 00:44:36,306
OFFICE TO LET THEM KNOW SOMEONE 

1243
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:37,808
WAS POSING AS THE SENATOR.  

1244
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,676
IT IS EXCEEDINGLY EMBARRASSING 

1245
00:44:39,676 --> 00:44:41,344
FOR THE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE IT 

1246
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:43,981
EXPOSES JUST HOW EASY IT WAS 

1247
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:46,683
FOR A CASUAL COMEDIAN WITH A 

1248
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:47,817
PODCAST TO SPEAK TO THE 

1249
00:44:47,817 --> 00:44:48,919
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

1250

FOR FOUR MINUTES. 

1251
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:52,155
>> IT IS ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE 

1252
00:44:52,155 --> 00:44:53,423
THAT HE WAS ABLE TO TALK TO 

1253
00:44:53,423 --> 00:44:55,259
PRESIDENT TRUMP ACCORDING TO 

1254
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,059

00:44:56,059 --> 00:44:59,797
I WANT TO ASK YOU THOUGH A LOT 

1256
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:02,299

WHAT PROMPTED HIM TO RETIRE AT 

1261
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:09,173
THIS SPECIFIC TIME.  

1262
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:10,874
DO WE KNOW YET ERROL? 

1263
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,676

TALK TO POTENTIALLY 

1267
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:23,353
REPLACEMENTS.  

1268
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:25,588
WE DON'T KNOW WHY JUSTICE 

1269
00:45:25,588 --> 00:45:26,189
KENNEDY ANNOUNCED HIS 

1270
00:45:26,189 --> 00:45:27,024
RETIREMENT NOW. 

1271
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,792
USUALLY THEY DO IT WITH A 

1272
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,794
RECESS AND IT WOULD FIT WITH 

1273
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,062
THAT PRECEDENT AND HE HAS 

1274
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:36,232
SERVED ALMOST TWICE AS LONG AS 

1275
00:45:36,232 --> 00:45:38,534
WHAT IS A TYPICAL TENURE OF 16 

1276
00:45:38,534 --> 00:45:40,270
YEARS AND JUSTICE KENNEDY BEING 

1277
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,672
ON THE BENCH FOR THREE DECADES, 

1278
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:44,775
81 YEARS OLD LIKE ANYONE ELSE 

1279
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:45,976
THAT IS ACCOMPLISHED  AT THAT 

1280
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:48,078
TIME HE LIKELY WANTS TO SPEND 

1281
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,079
MORE TIME WITH HIS WIFE AND 

1282
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,280
FAMILY. 

1283
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:50,914
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN SPEECHES HE 

1284
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,684
MADE EARLIER THIS WEEK IN 

1285
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,451
WISCONSIN CLAIMED THAT IT WAS 

1286
00:45:55,451 --> 00:45:56,119
HIS DISCUSSION WITH JUSTICE 

1287
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:57,120
KENNEDY AND THE ASSURANCE THAT 

1288
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,491
PRESIDENT TRUMP GAVE HIM THAT 

1289
00:46:01,491 --> 00:46:02,592
HE WOULD BE REPLACED WITH A 

1290
00:46:02,592 --> 00:46:04,861
CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE AND 

1291
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:05,696
ULTIMATELY TIPPED JUSTICE 

1292
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:06,662
KENNEDY TO MAKE THIS DECISION 

1293
00:46:06,662 --> 00:46:09,900
BUT IT IS A CONSEQUENTIAL ONE. 

1294
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,102
>> IT IS AND WE KNOW THAT 

1295
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,570
DEMOCRATS WANT TO WAIT TO AFTER 

1296
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,304
MIDTERMS HOPING THE NUMBERS 

1297
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:18,408
WOULD BE BETTER IN CONGRESS BUT 

1298
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,444
WHAT IS THE SENSE.  

1299
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,912
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT A 

1300
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:22,512
POTENTIAL CONFIRMATION ABOUT 

1301
00:46:22,512 --> 00:46:23,046
WHOEVER THE PRESIDENT 

1302
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:24,014
NOMINATES? 

1303
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:28,651
>> IT IS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE 

1304
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:29,719
JUSTICE KENNEDY HAS 

1305
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:30,286
HISTORICALLY BEEN THE SWING 

1306
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:34,825
VOTE WITH THE WINGS OF THE 

1307
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:35,292
SUPREME COURT.  

1308
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,161
HIS DECISIONS HAVE HELPED 

1309
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:39,729
PROVIDE RIGHTS TO GAY AMERICANS 

1310
00:46:39,729 --> 00:46:42,065
AND HE HAS UPHELD ABORTION AS 

1311
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:42,432
WELL. 

1312
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:43,333
WITH HIS POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT 

1313
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,735
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

1314
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,103
COMMITMENT TO REPLACE HIM WITH 

1315
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:46,703
A CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE 

1316
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:48,338
DEMOCRATS AND LIBERALS ARE 

1317
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:51,341
CONCERNED THAT THIS IS THE 

1318
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:52,809
FIRST STEP TO ROE VERSUS WADE 

1319
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,143
THAT LEGALIZE THE ABORTION TO 

1320
00:46:54,143 --> 00:46:55,646
BEING OVERTURNED. 

1321
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,681
THEY TRIED TO PUSH SENATE 

1322
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:00,317
LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL TO DELAY 

1323
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,518
THIS VOTE UNTIL AFTER THE 

1324
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:03,120
MIDTERM ELECTIONS ON THE SLIM 

1325
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:08,425
CHANCE THAT PERHAPS DEMOCRATS 

1326
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:13,630
WOULD HAVE ENOUGH SEATS TO GAIN 

1327
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,966
THE MAJORITY IN THE SENATE. 

1328
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:16,967
PRESIDENT TRUMP MET WITH 

1329
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:17,667
SEVERAL SENATORS THIS WEEK TO 

1330
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:19,937
GAUGE WHAT WOULD BE PALATABLE 

1331
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:20,637
FOR THEM. 

1332
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:23,640
WHAT TYPE OF NOMINEE.  

1333
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,844
THERE ARE TWO PRO ABORTION 

1334
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:28,444
RIGHTS, REPUBLICAN SENATORS, 

1335
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:30,480
LISA MCCOWSKY AND SUSAN OWENS 

1336
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,149
OF MAINE HAVE YOU INDICATED 

1337
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:34,717
THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE 

1338
00:47:34,717 --> 00:47:36,987
SOMEONE OVERTURN ROE VERSUS 

1339
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:37,421
WADE. 

1340
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:41,491
COLLINS SEES IT AS UNSETTLED 

1341
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:44,261
LAW AND PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE 

1342
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,528
WISE TO APPOINT A JUSTICE THAT 

1343
00:47:45,528 --> 00:47:48,565
IS NOT NEGATIVE IN ROE VERSUS 

1344
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:49,866
WADE BUT THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE 

1345
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,468
WOULD NOT ASK POTENTIAL 

1346
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:52,068
NOMINEES SPECIFICALLY ABOUT 

1347
00:47:52,068 --> 00:47:52,769
THEIR VIEWS ON THIS ISSUE 

1348
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,037
BECAUSE HE FELT IT WOULD BE 

1349
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:54,738
INAPPROPRIATE BUT WE ARE 

1350
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,673
STANDING BY TO SEE WHO HE WILL 

1351
00:47:56,673 --> 00:48:01,044
MEET IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS AS A 

1352
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:01,577
POTENTIAL REPLACEMENT FOR 

1353
00:48:01,577 --> 00:48:01,978
JUSTICE KENNEDY. 

1354
00:48:01,978 --> 00:48:05,382
>> TALK HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THE 

1355
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:05,982
SUPREME COURT THAT IT IS NOT 

1356
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:11,221
DIVERSE ENOUGH ESPECIALLY ON 

1357
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,857
ETHNIC LEVEL AND YOU ARE MAKING 

1358
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:17,227
DECISIONS ON PEOPLE THAT COME 

1359
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,363
FROM A WIDE RANGE OF 

1360
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:20,564
BACKGROUNDS ANYTHING ON THAT? 

1361
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,899
>> THERE IS ONE NOMINEE WHO IF 

1362
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:23,767
CONFIRMED WOULD BE THE FIRST 

1363
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:28,805
INDIAN AMERICAN TO SIT ON THE 

1364
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:32,542
SUPREME COURT AND THAT IS AMAR 

1365
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:35,245
PARAV AND CURRENTLY SERVES ON 

1366
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:35,812
THE 6:00 CIRCUIT COURT OF 

1367
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:37,080
APPEALS IN CINCINNATI AND THERE 

1368
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,951
ARE TWO WOMEN ON HIS SHORT LIST 

1369
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:42,319
OF POSSIBLE REPLACEMENTS AND 

1370
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,522
THAT INCLUDES AMY BARRETT.  

1371
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,223
SHE IS 46 YEARS OLD AND WAS 

1372
00:48:47,223 --> 00:48:48,324
APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP TO 

1373
00:48:48,324 --> 00:48:50,060
SIT ON THE 7th CIRCUIT COURT 

1374
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,561
THERE IN CHICAGO.  

1375
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,196
BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE 

1376
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:54,798
CLEAR IN HIS SPEECHES AND TO US 

1377
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:58,902
YESTERDAY ON AIR FORCE ONE THAT 

1378
00:48:58,902 --> 00:48:59,702
HE WANTS TO NOMINATE SOMEONE 

1379
00:48:59,702 --> 00:49:00,403
THAT IS RELATIVELY YOUNG AS FAR 

1380
00:49:00,403 --> 00:49:05,408
AS JUDGES TO SIT AND RULE ON 

1381
00:49:05,408 --> 00:49:06,943
THE SUPREME COURT FOR 

1382
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:07,344
GENERATIONS. 

1383
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,546
SO WHOEVER HE CHOOSES HE WANTS 

1384
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:12,249
IT TO BE SWIFT AND A LASTING 

1385
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:12,482
LEGACY. 

1386
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,851
ERROL BARNETT COMING TO US IN 

1387
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:17,554
NEW JERSEY TRAVELING WITH THE 

1388
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:18,755
PRESIDENT.  

1389
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:19,055
THANK YOU. 

1390
00:49:19,055 --> 00:49:19,422
>>> YOU GOT IT. 

1391
00:49:19,422 --> 00:49:21,791
>> COLLEGE STUDENTS OFTEN HAVE 

1392
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:22,458
CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR FINANCIAL 

1393
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:22,725
FUTURES.  

1394
00:49:22,725 --> 00:49:23,960
MANY GRADUATE WITH DEBTS THAT 

1395
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,696
WILL TAKE YEARS TO PAY OFF.  

1396
00:49:26,696 --> 00:49:28,698
BUT SOME STUDENTS HAVE ADDED 

1397
00:49:28,698 --> 00:49:32,736
PRESSURES THAT WE DON'T OFTEN 

1398
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:33,269
ASSOCIATE WITH COLLEGE. 

1399
00:49:33,269 --> 00:49:33,903
CARTER EVANS REPORTS FROM LOS 

1400
00:49:33,903 --> 00:49:34,170
ANGELES. 

1401
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:36,973
>> I BELIEVE THAT I'M GOING TO 

1402
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,275
A DIFFERENT SCHOOL THAN MY 

1403
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:38,608
PEERS ARE.  

1404
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:41,911
THEY HAVE HOUSES UP THE HILL 

1405
00:49:41,911 --> 00:49:42,545
AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED.  

1406
00:49:42,545 --> 00:49:47,484
THIS IS A NOT THE COLLEGE THAT 

1407
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:47,751
I GO TO. 

1408
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:50,020
>> WHY REYES MAY BLEND IN ON 

1409
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,055
CAMPUS HE IS KEEPING A SECRET 

1410
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:55,225
FROM HIS CLASSMATES.  

1411
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:57,561
HE IS HOMELESS.  

1412
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:58,829
HIS SCHOOL LOCKER IS HIS 

1413
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,129
CLOSET.  

1414
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,796
HE BRUSHES HIS TEETH IN A 

1415
00:50:00,796 --> 00:50:03,600
PUBLIC RESTROOM AND AT TIMES 

1416
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,968
SLEEPS ON THIS SOFA INSIDE A 24-

1417
00:50:05,968 --> 00:50:06,435
HOUR CAMPUS LIBRARY. 

1418
00:50:06,435 --> 00:50:07,370
>> MY FIRST QUARTER HERE 

1419
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,705
ACTUALLY LIVED INSIDE OF MY 

1420
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:08,905
CAR. 

1421
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:10,307
THAT'S WHERE I HAD MY CLOTHES 

1422
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:11,574
AND EVERYTHING I NEEDED FOR 

1423
00:50:11,574 --> 00:50:11,774
THE. 

1424
00:50:11,774 --> 00:50:13,643
>> BUT AFTER THE CAR WAS 

1425
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:15,445
TOTALED IN AN ACCIDENT, A 

1426
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,781
HOMELESS SHELTER A FEW MILES 

1427
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,050
AWAY FROM CAMPUS WAS HIS ONLY 

1428
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,151
OPTION. 

1429
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:22,586
ACCORDING TO THE U.S. 

1430
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:27,057
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THERE 

1431
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,291
WERE 32,000 HOMELESS COLLEGE 

1432
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:28,992
STUDENTS IN 2017.

>> I WANT TO BE AN ORTHOPEDIC 

1436
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:36,866
SURGEON. 

1437
00:50:36,866 --> 00:50:37,800
>> HIS TUITION IS $13,000 WHICH 

1438
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,102
IS COVERED BY FINANCIAL AID, 

1439
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:40,470
STUDENT LOANS AND A JOB ON 

1440
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:41,605
CAMPUS.  

1441
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:42,672
BUT AFTER BOOKS AND FOOD THERE 

1442
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:45,942
IS NOTHING LEFT FOR RENT. 

1443
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:46,676
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS 

1444
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,311
CAMPUS, THE BEAUTY AND THE 

1445
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:49,679
PRESTIGE OF BEING HERE, IT IS 

1446
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:50,680
HARD TO IMAGINE THAT SOME OF 

1447
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,816
THE STUDENTS DON'T HAVE A HOME 

1448
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:53,649
TO GO TO. 

1449
00:50:53,649 --> 00:50:55,652
>> IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE 

1450
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,821
OBVIOUSLY IT DOES EXIST.  

1451
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,357
IT IS JUST DIFFICULT TO GRASP 

1452
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:01,891
AND PUT INTO A QUANTATATIVE 

1453
00:51:01,891 --> 00:51:02,159
FORM. 

1454
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,927
>> AND NOT JUST A HOUSING 

1455
00:51:04,927 --> 00:51:05,328
PROBLEM.  

1456
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:11,601
A SURVEY OF STUDENTS AT TEN

00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,874
CLASSMEN ARE FOOD INSECURE AND 

1460
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:18,441

00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:17,160
DO YOU GET A SENSE 

1646
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,494
THAT'S EVEN A FACTOR IN THIS? 

1647
00:58:18,494 --> 00:58:21,631
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S A FACTOR 

1648
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:21,797
FOR 

1649
00:58:21,797 --> 00:58:23,232
PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT IF MR. 

1650
00:58:23,232 --> 00:58:24,500
KAVANAUGH DID GET 

1651
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,402
THE NOMINATION, I THINK THAT 

1652
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:27,270
WOULD CLEARLY BE 

1653
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:27,970
SOMETHING DEMOCRATS WOULD DRAW 

1654
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:28,972
ATTENTION TO.  

1655
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:31,574
AS WITH SO MANY THINGS DURING 

1656
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:32,976
THE TRUMP ERA, 

1657
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,310
WE'RE IN A UNIQUE SITUATION 

1658
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:34,877
HERE.  

1659
00:58:34,877 --> 00:58:35,278
CLEARLY THIS 

1660
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:37,714
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE COULD 

1661
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:43,486
HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY 

1662
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,688
IN  ADJUDICATING WHETHER THE 

1663
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:46,522
PRESIDENT HAS THE 

1664
00:58:46,522 --> 00:58:48,558
POWER TO PARDON HIMSELF AND 

1665
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:49,759
THAT IS DEEP WATER 

1666
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:50,560
LEGALLY AND POLITICALLY BUT 

1667
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,194
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE 

1668
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:51,461
SAILING. 

1669
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,529
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 

1670
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:53,762
CHANGES 

1671
00:58:53,762 --> 00:58:54,797
POTENTIALLY AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1672
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:55,331
THERE'S BEEN 

1673
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:56,765
TALK THAT JOHN KELLY MAY BE ON 

1674
00:58:56,765 --> 00:58:57,700
HIS WAY OUT.  

1675
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,069
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT? 

1676
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:05,274
>> MY REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT 

1677
00:59:05,274 --> 00:59:05,675
THAT COULD 

1678
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:07,877
BE QUITE IMMINENT.  

1679
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,779
EVEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT 

1680
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:11,180
BEEN SKEPTICAL OF JOHN KELLY 

1681
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,315
HAVE BEEN SAYING 

1682
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:13,983
THE END MAY BE NEAR.  

1683
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,585
MR. KELLY HIMSELF SAID HE 

1684
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:16,986
WAS BASICALLY PLANNING TO STAY 

1685
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,688
A YEAR WHICH IS 

1686
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:23,393
ALMOST UP.  

1687
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:28,231
IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL 

1688
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:28,831
SUCCESSORS, 

1689
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:32,035
WE HEAR MULVANEY AND NICK AIRS. 

1690
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:33,368
>> WE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT 

1691
00:59:33,368 --> 00:59:34,203
BARACK OBAMA.  

1692
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:36,205
HE WAS IN FACT ADDRESSING A 

1693
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:37,674
CROWD IN D.C., A 

1694
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,910
FUNDRAISING EVENT FOR THE DNC.  

1695
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:41,677
DO YOU THINK 

1696
00:59:41,677 --> 00:59:44,046
THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PRESENCE 

1697
00:59:44,046 --> 00:59:45,181
WILL HELP 

1698
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:45,682
DEMOCRATS?  

1699
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:47,684
IT DIDN'T ALWAYS TRANSLATE 

1700
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:48,017
DURING 

1701
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:48,517
HIS PRESIDENTIAL YEARS? 

1702
00:59:48,517 --> 00:59:53,189
>> YOU MAKE A FAIR POINT WHICH 

1703
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:56,292
IS THAT A 

1704
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:57,426
LOT OF BARACK OBAMA'S 

1705
00:59:57,426 --> 00:59:59,929
POPULARITY WAS PERSONAL.  

1706
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,532
HE IS A VERY MAGNETIC FIGURE.  

1707
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:03,132
I THINK 

1708
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:10,073
OPPONENTS AND CRITICS WOULD SAY 

1709
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:10,440
HE'S A GIFTED 

1710
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,440
ORATOR.  

1711
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,976
IF I WERE A DEMOCRAT, I WOULD 

1712
01:00:13,976 --> 01:00:14,310
MUCH 

1713
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,212
PREFER HAVING HIM ON MY SIDE 

1714
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:16,813
THAN VARIOUS OTHER 

1715
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:17,780
LEADING MEMBERS OF THE PARTY. 

1716
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,615
>> I WANT TO TURN TO NORTH 

1717
01:00:19,615 --> 01:00:19,915
KOREA FOR A 

1718
01:00:19,915 --> 01:00:20,416
SECOND.  

1719
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:21,917
ITS BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE THAT 

1720
01:00:21,917 --> 01:00:22,151
SUMMIT 

1721
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:23,552
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE 

1722
01:00:23,552 --> 01:00:24,687
NORTH KOREAN 

1723
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:24,987
LEADER.  

1724
01:00:24,987 --> 01:00:26,889
SINCE THEN, THE PRESIDENT SAID 

1725
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:27,190
THAT 

1726
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,891
NORTH KOREA IS NO LONGER A 

1727
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:30,293
NUCLEAR THREAT BUT 

1728
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,329
WE KNOW THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT 

1729
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:33,562
THERE'S 

1730
01:00:33,562 --> 01:00:36,032
INCREASING PRODUCTION.  

1731
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:37,333
HE SAID THE REMAINS OF 

1732
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:38,634
SOLDIERS KILLED IN NORTH KOREA 

1733
01:00:38,634 --> 01:00:39,936
HAVE COME HOME, 

1734
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:40,803
WE KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.  

1735
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,538
WHERE DO WE STAND IN 

1736
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:42,938
THE NEGOTIATIONS? 

1737
01:00:42,938 --> 01:00:45,207
>> THINK THE KEY THING IS THE 

1738
01:00:45,207 --> 01:00:46,008
GAP BETWEEN 

1739
01:00:46,008 --> 01:00:47,242
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 

1740
01:00:47,242 --> 01:00:49,412
CLAIMED AND REALITY.  

1741
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:51,013
HE WAS SUGGESTING THAT THAT 

1742
01:00:51,013 --> 01:00:52,415
SUMMIT WITH KIM 

1743
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:54,450
JONG UN HAD SOLVED THE NUCLEAR 

1744
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:55,718
PROBLEM.  

1745
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:56,018
THESE 

1746
01:00:56,018 --> 01:00:58,621
SALT LITE IMAGES THAT WE'RE -- 

1747
01:00:58,621 --> 01:00:59,222
SATELLITE IMAGES 

1748
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:00,323
THAT WE'RE GETTING PROVE THAT 

1749
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,424
IS NOT THE CASE, 

1750
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:04,127
IN FACT THE REGIME COULD BE 

1751
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,727
TRYING TO BOLSTER 

1752
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:05,461
ITS NUCLEAR PROBLEM.  

1753
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:06,562
THAT'S A CLEAR PROBLEM, 

1754
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:10,233
AND I THINK THAT WILL HANG OVER 

1755
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:10,900
ANY FURTHER 

1756
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:11,234
NEGOTIATIONS. 

1757
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:12,969
>> DO YOU THINK WITH THOSE 

1758
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:13,269
SATELLITE 

1759
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:14,737
IMAGES THAT THE WHITE HOUSE 

1760
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:15,938
MIGHT CHANGE THEIR 

1761
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:17,440
APPROACH TOWARD KIM JONG UN? 

1762
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,442
>> IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.  

1763
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:19,909
PRESIDENT 

1764
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:22,044
TRUMP COULD CONSIDER THAT A 

1765
01:01:22,044 --> 01:01:22,912
BETRAYAL OF TRUST 

1766
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:25,014
OR A MISLEAD, EVIDENCE THAT HE 

1767
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,248
HAD BEEN MISLED 

1768
01:01:26,248 --> 01:01:27,617
IN HIS INITIAL TALKS.  

1769
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:28,918
IT COULD HARDEN THE 

1770
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:30,853
WHITE HOUSE'S LINE POTENTIALLY, 

1771
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:31,521
BUT AS WE ALL 

1772
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,957
KNOW, PREDICTING HOW THIS WHITE 

1773
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:35,324
HOUSE WILL 

1774
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:37,126
REACT, SPECIFICALLY IN RELATION 

1775
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:37,760
TO NORTH KOREA, 

1776
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,328
HAS PROVEN A FOOL'S ERRAND IN 

1777
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:39,762
THE PAST. 

1778
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:41,163
>> WE WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT 

1779
01:01:41,163 --> 01:01:41,463
WITH NORTH 

1780
01:01:41,463 --> 01:01:41,964
KOREA.  

1781
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:44,600
I WANT TO ASK YOU, THIS 

1782
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,268
WEEKEND, 

1783
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:46,369
RALLIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY 

1784
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:46,869
AGAINST PRESIDENT 

1785
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:47,469
TRUMP'S FAMILY SEPARATION 

1786
01:01:47,469 --> 01:01:47,837
POLICY.  

1787
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,539
DO YOU GET A 

1788
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,907
SENSE THAT IMMIGRATION IS GOING 

1789
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:52,742
TO HELP OR HURT 

1790
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:56,546
HIM GOING INTO MIDTERMS AND HOW 

1791
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,714
WILL IT HELP 

1792
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:58,081
THE DEMOCRATS? 

1793
01:01:58,081 --> 01:01:59,849
>> IMMIGRATION AT LARGE, I 

1794
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:00,550
THINK, CAN HELP 

1795
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:05,054
ONE PARTY OR ANOTHER, DEPENDING 

1796
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:05,787
ON THE 

1797
01:02:05,787 --> 01:02:06,688
DEMOGRAPHICS OF DISTRICTS. 

1798
01:02:06,688 --> 01:02:07,924
THE ISSUE ABOUT 

1799
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:09,225
WHICH PEOPLE ARE PROTESTING, I 

1800
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,261
THINK THAT DOES 

1801
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:13,395
HURT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO 

1802
01:02:13,395 --> 01:02:14,063
SOME EXTENT.  

1803
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:21,604
THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES WE SEE 

1804
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:21,937
IN POLITICS 

1805
01:02:21,937 --> 01:02:22,638
THAT HAS AN EMOTIONAL RESONANCE 

1806
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:23,940
BEYOND A NEWS 

1807
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:24,340
STORY.  

1808
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,042
I THINK THE VISCERAL IDEA OF 

1809
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:26,342
SEPARATING 

1810
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:27,443
CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS 

1811
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:28,244
DOES HIT HOME WITH 

1812
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,045
PEOPLE.  

1813
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:30,646
I THINK THAT HITS PEOPLE WHO 

1814
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:31,147
ARE NOT 

1815
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:34,350
FOLLOWING EVERY TWIST AND TURN 

1816
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:34,950
IN WASHINGTON 

1817
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:36,552
BUT HAVE AN UNDERSTANDABLE 

1818
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:37,153
AVERSION TO THAT 

1819
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:37,453
TREATMENT. 

1820
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:38,955
>> AND DESPITE THE HOT WEATHER, 

1821
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:39,922
LOTS OF 

1822
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,357
FOLKS OUT MAKING A STAND.  

1823
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:42,124
NILE, THANKS FOR 

1824
01:02:42,124 --> 01:02:42,425
JOINING US. 

1825
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,359
>> THANK YOU. 

1826
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:52,001
>>> THIS SUNDAY ON FACE THE 

1827
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:53,502
NATION, 

1828
01:02:53,502 --> 01:02:56,138
