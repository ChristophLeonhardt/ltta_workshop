1
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:10,416
“— our future.

2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:12,896
I say, get your résumés ready.”

3
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,495
“My name is Samantha Fuentes and
I am a survivor of the Stoneman

4
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:24,890
Douglas school shooting.

5
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,360
It’s as if we need permission
to ask our friends not to die!

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,550
Lawmakers and
politicians will scream,

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,690
‘Guns are not the issue,’
but can’t look me in the eye.

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,970
[sputtering]

9
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,440
I just threw up on international
television, and it feels great!

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,357
[cheering]

11
00:00:46,357 --> 00:00:47,940
You don’t see us
when we get offstage.

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,030
You don’t see us when
the cameras turn off.

13
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,900
You don’t see when you have
panic attacks or when you cry,

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,090
and you cry, and you
can’t stop crying.”

15
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,388
“You all right?”

16
00:00:57,388 --> 00:00:58,852
[sobbing]

17
00:00:58,852 --> 00:00:59,828
[yelling]

18
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:00,804
“Yeah, Sam!”

19
00:01:00,804 --> 00:01:02,268
“Thank you so much.”

20
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:05,209
“Woo!”

21
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:09,644
“When I got shot, the bullet
was deferred into a wall first,

22
00:01:09,644 --> 00:01:11,310
before hitting me,
and then broke apart.

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,060
So I have pieces of
metal in my face.

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,817
And like, I can stick my
finger on the top of my lip

25
00:01:16,817 --> 00:01:17,900
and feel a piece of metal.

26
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,470
And that alone — 
that’s not normal.

27
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,060
Like, there’s nothing
normal about having

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,685
metal in your face,
unless it’s braces.

29
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,470
When I got to D.C., I really
didn’t know what to expect.

30
00:01:34,809 --> 00:01:36,694
D.C.’s honestly really pretty.

31
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,450
I wish I could appreciate
it more, but I can’t.

32
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,970
I feel like sometimes
I’m not the right person,

33
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,530
or maybe this isn’t my job.

34
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,984
Or maybe, as an 18-year-old,
like, this isn’t the path

35
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:53,150
that I was supposed to take.

36
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,930
“This is for MSNBC.”

37
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,133
“We have another 14.”

38
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:09,063
“I can move, also.”

39
00:02:09,064 --> 00:02:10,250
“We can move somewhere else.”

40
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,150
“I’m just not ready for this.

41
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,649
I’m sorry.”

42
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:12,440
“It’s O.K.”

43
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,015
“I’m sorry.”

44
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:14,390
“Yeah, we’re going
somewhere else.”

45
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,310
“O.K., cool.”

46
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,185
“These are some of the
families from Parkland.”

47
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:18,070
“Hi, I’m Josh.”

48
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:21,836
“Oh.

49
00:02:21,836 --> 00:02:22,670
No, no, it’s fine.

50
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,255
Ever since the shooting, I
have been suffering from PTSD.

51
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,480
You don’t really think
you notice it at first,

52
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,340
until, like, something
sets you off.

53
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,940
Sometimes when someone
beeps their horn

54
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,340
or they slam their door, or
if someone, like, sneezes

55
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,780
too loudly, it freaks me out.”

56
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:49,200
“I’m really honored to have
a chance to meet with you.

57
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,530
And you guys have really been
through a lot, haven’t you?”

58
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,450
“Yeah.”

59
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,908
“I’d really love to
just hear what’s

60
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:57,360
on your mind, how
you guys are doing.”

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,760
“I don’t ever want someone
to be in my position.

62
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,450
I don’t ever want someone
to be afraid of loud noises

63
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,040
and afraid to go to school.

64
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,030
And I think, out
of all the people

65
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,655
who can speak efficiently
about the topic are

66
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:15,760
the people who have been in
front of a barrel of an AR-15.”

67
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,800
“The voice of moral
authority that you all have

68
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,536
is just a really,
really powerful voice.

69
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,060
It’s really powerful.”

70
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,810
“Some people don’t believe
that participating in a cause

71
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,080
will ever make a difference.”

72
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,185
“So I would like to
bring to the stage

73
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:36,390
a poet from Stoneman
Douglas, Samantha Fuentes.”

74
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,618
“And some people don’t
believe that they matter.

75
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:41,808
[applause]

76
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:44,100
And if you’re just
that one person,

77
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,710
just speak up for yourself.

78
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,830
Just having those ears
available and having those

79
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,340
faces to look at and to
speak to is the first step.

80
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,520
Can my present love
breach the past tense?

81
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,080
Does loving the
dead make any sense?

82
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,210
I love you.

83
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,470
I love you.

84
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,036
I love you.

85
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:04,410
Will you come back
to this place?

86
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,870
I feel like I’ve been changed.

87
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,870
Like, maybe not — like,
yes, maybe physically.

88
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,034
But like, I feel like
something more is there, like,

89
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:16,950
when I look at myself.

90
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,740
Like, there is this
feeling that I really

91
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,980
can’t wrap my head around
that, like, just confuses me.

92
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,660
And like, it always happens when
I look at myself in the mirror.

93
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,993
And like, I have to realize
that I’m not the same person

94
00:04:27,993 --> 00:04:30,470
and I had no control
of that transformation.

95
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,490
Today is March 24, the
March for Our Lives.

96
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,620
Protect our schools like
we do our other government

97
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,820
establishments!

98
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,720
And one more request —

99
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,766
listen.

100
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:45,168
[cheering]

101
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,460
Will you give up,
or is enough enough?”

102
00:04:54,460 --> 00:00:00,000
[cheering]
