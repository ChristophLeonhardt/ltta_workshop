I wanted to know about Justin Trudeau's week-long costume party when he was in India and you will never guess what the government had to tell me remember Justin Trudeau's disastrous trip to India I actually think it's going to be a very long time before that thing works its way out of our collective consciousness besides the international scandal caused by Justin Trudeau inviting a convicted attempted murderer and Sikh separatist for supper there was the secondary scandal of Justin Trudeau blaming the horrible invite on the Indian government themselves and then there was the mockery my lord the mockery we were an international laughingstock because of Trudeau's bizarre antics and behavior in India with his impromptu dance performances the ridiculous prayer hands at everybody all the time and then there was the marauding about everywhere in the country in the over-the-top costumes every single Trudeau was consistently dressed in Bollywood style costumes for much of the duration of the trip it was so strange and over-the-top that Bollywood actors remarked that Trudeau was behaving more Bollywood than Bollywood itself once or twice fine but after a week it started to annoy not only Canadians but Indians too I wanted to know who was involved in the planning of those outfits I wanted to know whose idea this whole thing was who selected to close and more importantly if anybody at some point raised some sort of objection to this or was it all the work of a bunch of yes men letting our impulsive Prime Minister embarrass us in India so just after Trudeau got home I asked the government on March 1st to provide copies of all documents regarding the planning for the Prime Minister's trip to India in February 2018 including anything related to clothing and wardrobe for the prime minister and his family and any cost incurred to purchase the clothing for the trip since October 1st 2017 I suspected acting so ridiculous wasn't a cheap thing for the Trudeau's to do I'd love to tell you what I found out but I can't my response back from the Privy Council office said that at the present time meaning the original time limit of 30 days would unreasonably interfere with operations further we have found it necessary to consult other government institutions and as a result an extension of up to 300 days beyond the statutory deadline is required to meet your request the new legislative due date for your request is January 25th 2019 this is unbelievable it's going to take the government a full 11 months to tell me who picked the clothes and how much the whole thing cost us I don't believe it should take this long I don't believe it at all I don't believe it does take this long you know what does take this long though it's going to take this long for our collective annoyance at the behavior of our adolescent prime minister to wane a little bit from our memory and that's really what these bureaucrats and Trudeau are counting on here for the rabble media I'm Sheila Gunn read what you just saw there is my daily video that I do here at the rebel but I also have my own full-length show but to get access to my show and the rest of our amazing premium content you got to become a rebel subscriber today you
