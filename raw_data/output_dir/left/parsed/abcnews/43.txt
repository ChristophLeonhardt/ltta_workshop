>> Announcer: THIS IS AN ABC 
NEWS SPECIAL REPORT.
>>> GOOD MORNING EVERYONE.
FOR THOSE OF YOU JUST JOINING US
I'M ROBIN ROBERTS IN NEW YORK.
WE BREAK INTO YOUR REGULAR 
PROGRAMMING WITH NEWS ON THE 
DEADLY SCHOOL RAMPAGE IN 
FLORIDA.
THE SHERIFF SCOTT ISRAEL IS 
ABOUT TO SPEAK. 
>> ALL THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES 
HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED.
WE WILL BE RELEASING A LIST OF 
THOSE THAT LOST THEIR LIVES 
YESTERDAY.
IT WILL BE RELEASED THROUGHOUT 
PIO IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF 
TIME.
BUT ALL THE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN 
NOTIFIED.
OUR DETECTIVES WORKED THROUGH 
THE NIGHT ON THIS VERY DAUNTING 
A AND CHALLENGING TASK BUT IT 
WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND 
THEY WORKED TIRELESSLY.
THIS COMMUNITY IS HURTING RIGHT 
NOW.
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF 
CONVERSATIONS OVER THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF DAYS AND WEEKS AND I'M
GOING TO BE VERY ANIMATED ABOUT 
WHAT I THINK THIS COUNTRY CAN 
DO.
TO POSSIBLY PREVENT THESE 
TRAGEDIES IN THE FUTURE.
TODAY IS A DAY OF HEALING AND 
MOURNING.
THE SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY.
HE WILL BE APPEARING BEFORE HIS 
FIRST MAGISTRATE TODAY AT 2:00 
P.M. AT THE BROWARD COUNTY 
COURTHOUSE.
THIS MORNING WE HAVE BEGUN 
WORKING WITH THE FBI AND YOU'LL 
BE HEARING FROM THE SPECIAL 
AGENT IN CHARGE OF THE FBI IN A 
FEW MINUTES.
WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH THE 
FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT UNDER THE DIRECTION 
OF TROY WALKER.
WE WILL INTERVIEW EVERY SINGLE 
STUDENT OR EVERY PERSON IN THAT 
SCHOOL THAT POSSIBLY KNEW 
SOMETHING OR MIGHT NOT KNOW THEY
KNOW SOMETHING.
WE WILL MAKE SURE WE'RE ABLE TO 
PROSECUTE THIS CASE.
THE SUSPECT HAS BEEN CHARGED 
WITH 17 COUNTS OF PREMEDITATED 
MURDER.
LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL DO 
EVERYTHING WE CAN, THE FBI, 
OURSELVES TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS
PERSON IS CONVICTED OF ALL 
CHARGES AND THAT JUSTICE IS 
SERVED.
SADLY THERE HAVE BEEN COPYCAT 
THREATS MADE TODAY IN OTHER 
SCHOOLS.
WE WILL RESPOND TO EVERY THREAT.
EVERY THREAT WE RECEIVE WE WILL 
NOT CLASSIFY IT AS A COPYCAT OR 
PRANK CALL BUT RESPOND IN FULL 
AND INVESTIGATE IT.
ANY CALL THAT IS MADE 
FICTITIOUSLY, ANY FAKE CALL, ANY
CALL THAT'S MADE TO TAKE OUT 
RESOURCES AT A TIME LIKE THIS 
AND PLACE THEM IN PLACES WHERE 
WE DON'T NEED TO BE WE WILL DO 
THE FULL POWER OF THE SHERIFF'S 
OFFICE WILL INVESTIGATE THIS AND
CHARGE ANYONE ACCORDINGLY WITH 
THE MAXIMUM CHARGE WE POSSIBLY 
CAN WHEN DOING SOMETHING SO 
HORRIFIC.
SO PATHETIC.
GOVERNOR SCOTT IS GOING TO COME 
UP AND SPEAK.
AND THEN YOU CAN HEAR FROM 
SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE OF THE 
FBI.
I'LL RETURN TO THE MICROPHONE.
AND ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
I THINK IT'S NOTE WORTHY AT OUR 
NEXT PRESS CONFERENCE I WILL BE 
RELEASING A TIMELINE BASED ON 
INVESTIGATION AND VIDEO THAT WE 
HAVE CAPTURED AS TO WHAT 
HAPPENED YESTERDAY AND I WOULD 
LIKE TO TAKE YOU THROUGH IT IN 
CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER.
WE'RE NOT READY TO DO THAT AT 
THIS TIME BUT WHEN WE ARE, WE 
WILL BE BACK HERE AND RELEASE 
THAT.
NOW I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE 
FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR RICH SCOTT.
>> THANK YOU SHERIFF.
I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY IN THE
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT FOR ALL 
THEIR HARD WORK TO MAKE SURE 
THIS INDIVIDUAL, WE HAVE JUSTICE
AND TO MAKE SURE THIS NEVER 
HAPPENS AGAIN.
I THINK EVERYBODY UP HERE IS 
GOING TO SAY THE SAME THING.
OUR HEARTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH 
THESE FAMILIES.
THE FAMILIES THAT LOST A LOVED 
ONE AND THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE 
LOVED ONES STILL IN THE 
HOSPITAL, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO VISIT WITH SOME FAMILIES LAST
NIGHT AND THEN ALSO WE WANT TO 
MAKE SURE THIS NEVER HAPPENS 
AGAIN.
NEXT WEEK IN TALLAHASSEE I'LL 
SIT DOWN WITH STATE LEADERS AND 
HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT 
TWO THINGS.
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WHEN A 
PARENT IS READY TO SEND THEIR 
CHILD TO SCHOOL THAT IN FLORIDA 
THAT PARENT KNOWS THAT CHILD IS 
GOING TO BE SAFE?
NUMBER TWO, HOW DO WE MAKE SURE 
INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS 
DO NOT TOUCH A GUN?
WE NEED TO HAVE A REAL 
CONVERSATION SO WE HAVE PUBLIC 
SAFETY FOR SCHOOLS IN THIS 
STATE.
I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE SPEAKER, 
SENATE PRESIDENT AND THEY'RE 
COMMITTED TO PROVIDE THE 
RESOURCES AND HAVE A REAL 
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW DO WE 
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE PUBLIC 
SAFETY.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY 
CHILDREN AND MY GRANDCHILDREN, 
YOURS, EVERYBODY IN THIS STATE 
CAN WAKE UP AND BE SAFE.
I'M GOING TO STAY HERE AND DO 
EVERYTHING I CAN.
I KNOW ALL THE STATE RESOURCES 
AND EVERYONE IS GOING TO WORK 
HARD WITH THE SHERIFF'S 
DEPARTMENT, SCHOOL DISTRICT TO 
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GO 
FORWARD BUT THE VIOLENCE HAS TO 
STOP.
WE CANNOT LOSE ANOTHER CHILD IN 
THIS COUNTRY TO VIOLENCE IN A 
SCHOOL.
THERE'S MANY FAMILIES GRIEVING 
RIGHT NOW.
WE HAVE GOT TO GRIEVE WITH THEM,
MOURN WITH THEM BUT GIVE THEM 
THEIR SPACE.
THERE'LL BE A TIME THEY'LL WANT 
TO SIT DOWN AND TELL THEIR STORY
BY RIGHT NOW, THEY WANT THEIR 
OWN TIME TO GRIEVE.
SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY 
FROM THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TO
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR 
EVERYTHING THEY ARE DOING, THE 
SCHOOL DISTRICT, FOR EVERYTHING 
THEY'RE DOING TO KEEP PEOPLE 
SAFE AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
FOR THE VICTIM ADVOCATES COMING 
DOWN HERE TO BE HELPFUL.
>> GOOD MORNING.
I'M THE SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE 
WITH THE FBI.
I WANT TO EXPRESS MY HEART-FELT 
CONDOLENCES TO THE VICTIMS AND 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO SUFFERED 
THIS SENLESS AND COWARDLY ACT.
THE FBI CONTINUES TO STAND BY 
THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND SUPPORT
THEM AND GIVE THEM EVERY 
RESOURCE THEY NEED TO 
INVESTIGATE THIS HEINOUS CRIME.
IN 2017 THE FBI RECEIVED 
INFORMATION ABOUT A COMMENT MADE
ON A YOUTUBE CHANNEL.
THE COMMENT SIMPLY SAID, I'M 
GOING TO BE A PROFESSIONAL 
SCHOOL SHOOTER.
NO OTHER INFORMATION WAS 
INCLUDED WITH THAT COMMENT.
WHICH WOULD INDICATE A TIME, 
LOCATION OR THE TRUE IDENTITY OF
THE PERSON WHO MADE THE COMMENT.
THE FBI CONDUCTED DATA REVIEWS, 
CHECKS BUT WAS UNABLE TO FURTHER
IDENTIFY THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY
MADE THE COMMENT.
AGAIN AS A NATIVE SOUTH 
FLORIDIAN MY HEART GOES OUT TO 
THE VICTIMS, THE FAMILIES AND 
FRIENDS AND THE ENTIRE 
COMMUNITY.
THANK YOU.
>> I WOULD LIKE TO BRING UP OUR 
SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS RON 
RUNCY.
>> AGAIN AND WE CAN'T SAY THIS 
ENOUGH, EVERY MINUTE OF THE DAY 
IS FOCUSING ON HOW WE CAN 
SUPPORT OUR FAMILIES, OUR 
STUDENTS AND OUR STAFF AS WE 
WORK THROUGH THIS HORRIFIC 
SITUATION.
WE HAVE PROVIDED GRIEF 
COUNSELLORS AT SEVERAL 
LOCATIONS, TWO IN PARKLAND, TWO 
IN CORAL SPRINGS.
WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE 
CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE 
SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS.
WE'RE ALSO PROVIDING GRIEF 
COUNSELLORS ON SITE FOR STUDENTS
AND STAFF AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL 
NEAR HERE.
THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WE ARE 
PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO ALL OF OUR
SCHOOLS ON HOW TO HAVE 
CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR STUDENTS 
ON THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC.
I WILL TELL YOU THAT STUDENTS 
HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT TO ME, 
REACHING OUT TO STAFF, PROBABLY 
BOARD MEMBERS AND OTHERS SAYING 
THAT NOW, NOW IS THE TIME FOR 
THIS COUNTRY TO HAVE A REAL 
CONVERSATION ON SENSIBLE GUN 
CONTROL LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY.
OUR STUDENTS ARE ASKING FOR THAT
CONVERSATION.
AND I HOPE WE CAN GET IT DONE IN
THIS GENERATION BUT IF WE DON'T,
THEY WILL.
THE SECOND THING I WOULD SAY AND
THE GOVERNOR ALLUDED TO IT 
SOMETHING WE CAN GET DONE IN 
THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION IS SOME
REAL FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH 
SUPPORT FOR OUR YOUTH AND 
ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITY 
SO WE CAN PROPERLY PROVIDE THE 
RIGHT KIND OF INTERVENTIONS.
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DISCONNECTED 
YOUTH WANDERING AROUND IN OUR 
COMMUNITIES AND WE KNOW THEY 
NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT.
I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH 
MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE, 
THEY'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THE 
LEADERS THERE AND THE GOVERNOR 
TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE 
AMOUNTS THAT ARE BEING PUT ON 
THE TABLE RIGHT NOW FOR MENTAL 
HEALTH SERVICES SO WE CAN HAVE 
MORE COUNSELLORS.
MORE PSYCHOLOGISTS, MORE FAMILY 
COUNSELLORS, CASEWORKERS IN OUR 
SCHOOLS.
IT'S ABSOLUTELY NEEDED.
THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS 
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF 
INQUIRIES AS TO WHERE 
INDIVIDUALS CAN PROVIDE SUPPORT.
I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE IN THE 
BROWARD COMMUNITY AND AROUND 
THIS COUNTRY FOR YOUR CONTINUED 
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS, ACTS OF 
KINDNESS THAT WE SEE MINUTE BY 
MINUTE.
THERE IS A GO FUND ME ACCOUNT 
THAT'S BEEN SET UP AS WE TALKED 
ABOUT YESTERDAY.
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF 
FRAUDULENT TYPE OF ACTIVITY SET 
UP OUT THERE.
SO WE WORKED TO ESTABLISH 
SOMETHING CREDIBLE.
GO FUND ME ACCOUNT.
STONEMAN DOUGLAS FUND WHICH 
MOTION CAN MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS.
AGAIN, PLEASE KEEP OUR BABIES, 
OUR FAMILIES AND THIS ENTIRE 
COMMUNITY IN YOUR PRAYERS AS WE 
GO THROUGH THIS HEALING PROCESS.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A WHILE
FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH 
THIS.
BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
WE CAN EVERY DAY, CREATE THE 
GREATEST AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY 
THAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE WE'RE 
SUPPORTING OUR FAMILIES, AGAIN, 
I WANT TO THANK OUR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, SHERIFF 
ISRAEL, THE FBI, THE FIRST 
RESPONDERS.
AND WE HAD AN ATHLETIC DIRECTOR 
CAMPUS MONITOR WHO RESPONDED 
IMMEDIATELY WHEN THERE WAS SIGNS
OF TROUBLE IN THE SCHOOL.
UNFORTUNATELY THOSE TWO HEROES 
GIVE THEIR LIVES FOR OUR KIDS 
AND PROBABLY HELPED PREVENT THIS
FROM BEING WORSE.
SO WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR 
HEROES IN OUR SCHOOL EVERY DAY, 
OUR TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS FOR 
NOT ONLY ENSURING OUR KIDS ARE 
LEARNING AND DEVELOPING THE 
SKILLS THEY NEED TO HAVE A 
BRIGHT FUTURE BUT THEY LOVE AND 
TREAT THEM AS IF THEY'RE THEIR 
OWN CHILDREN.
THAT'S ANOTHER THING WE NEED TO 
DO, TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN 
BETTER COMPENSATE AND REWARD 
TEACHERS IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOT
JUST GIVE LIP SERVICE TO THE 
QUALITY OF THE WORK THEY 
PROVIDE.
THANK YOU.
>> AS I SAID YESTERDAY WHEN OUR 
ATTORNEY GENERAL FOUND OUT ABOUT
THIS TRAGEDY HAVING DEALT WITH 
THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB AND HAVING A
LOT OF EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA 
UNFORTUNATELY, SHE GOT ON THE 
PLANE AND WAS DOWN HERE WITHIN 
HOURS AND HELPED OUT AND HAS 
BEGUN TO HELP A LOT OF THE 
FAMILIES OUT.
I WOULD LIKE TO BRING HER UP 
HERE SO SHE CAN TELL YOU THE 
GREAT THINGS THEY'RE DOING TO 
TRY AND HELP OUR FAMILIES IN 
PARKLAND. 
>> THANK YOU SHERIFF.
THANK YOU GOVERNOR.
AND THANK YOU SPECIAL AGENT 
LASKY.
LAST NIGHT THERE WERE TWO SCENES
GOING ON.
ONE AT THE ACTUAL CRIME SCENE 
AND BROWARD SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND
THE FBI, THEY WERE SECOND TO 
NONE.
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLE WHAT THEY
DID.
THAT CRIME SCENE FROM A 
PROSECUTION POINT OF VIEW WAS 
METICULOUSLY DETAILED, AND IT 
TOOK AS LONG AS NEEDED TO TAKE 
TO MAKE SURE IT WAS THOROUGHLY 
PROCESSED AND ACCURATELY 
PROCESSED.
THE OTHER SCENE WAS AT THE HOTEL
WHERE WE WERE WITH THE FAMILY 
MEMBERS.
HAVING TO TELL WITH THE FBI 
ADVOCATES AND MY ADVOCATES THAT 
A CHILD, SOME 14 YEARS OLD DEAD 
IS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS YOU
HAVE TO DO IN YOUR CAREER.
THESE PARENTS TREMENDOUS 
FAMILIES ARE GRIEVING AND AGAIN 
PLEASE RESPECT THEIR PRIVACY.
WE WERE THERE UNTIL ABOUT 3:30 
IN THE MORNING WITH THESE 
FAMILIES AND MANY OF THEM HAD 
SIBLINGS WHO WERE IN THE SCHOOL 
AND SURVIVED AND THEN A BROTHER 
OR A SISTER DID NOT.
SO THAT WAS EXTREMELY TRAGIC.
BUT WE ARE PRAYING FOR THESE 
FAMILIES AND ARE CONTINUING TO 
PRAY FOR THESE FAMILIES AND 
JUSTICE IS DONE FOR THE ONE THAT
BRUTALLY MURDERED ALL OF THESE 
STUDENTS.
MY JOB NOW WILL CONTINUE TO BE 
TO HELP THE VICTIMS AND THE 
FAMILIES.
WE HAVE GOTTEN TO ALL OF THE 
VICTIMS WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES
TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN HELP PAY 
FOR THEIR FUNERAL EXPENSES.
IF YOU ARE IN THE HOSPITAL WITH 
YOUR FAMILY WE WILL BE COMING TO
YOU TODAY TO HELP YOU TO MAKE 
SURE WE HELP WITH YOUR HOSPITAL 
BILLS.
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT 
THERE.
WE WILL BE ON SCENE WITH THE FBI
AND SUPERINTENDENT WHO HAS DONE 
A GREAT JOB, OUR ADVOCATES WILL 
BE THERE TO PROVIDE COUNSELING.
WHAT WE SAW IN LAS VEGAS, WHAT 
WE SAW AT PULSE, PEOPLE WHO -- 
WE DON'T THINK WERE IMPACTED 
WERE IMPACTED.
SO WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE 
COUNSELING FOR ALL OF THEM.
I WAS ON THE PHONE UNTIL 2:00 
A.M. WITH GO FUND ME AND AGAIN 
FIRST THING THIS MORNING.
IT IS SAFE TO GIVE TO GO FUND 
ME.
THEY'RE PULLING BAD WEBSITES OFF
CONSTANTLY AND MONITORING 
EVERYTHING.
IN FACT, ONE OF THE TOP PEOPLE 
AT GO FUND ME KNEW A VICTIM, 
KNEW A VICTIM.
THAT'S HOW FAR REACHING THIS IS.
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE ONE 
UNIFIED SIDE.
SO PLEASE DON'T BE AFRAID TO 
GIVE TO GO FUND ME AND ALL OF 
THESE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES
WILL BE PROTECTED AND AGAIN 
GOVERNOR, I CANNOT THANK YOU FOR
YOUR SUPPORT.
WE HAVE BEEN ON THE PHONE 
CONSTANTLY.
HE WAS HERE THE SECOND THIS 
HAPPENED.
I CAN'T THANK YOU, FDLE, THE 
SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND THE FBI 
ENOUGH.
THIS IS WHAT YOU DON'T SEE 
AROUND THE COUNTRY.
YOU SEE TEAMWORK.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN FLORIDA.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES US VERY 
SPECIAL.
THANK YOU.
>> BEFORE WE TAKE QUESTIONS.
I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO THANK 
CONGRESSMAN TED DEUTSCHE FROM 
COMING DOWN FROM WASHINGTON, 
D.C.
THE ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM 
AROUND THE COUNTY.
MY MESSAGE TO THE COMMUNITY IS 
SIMPLE.
YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS, YOUR 
COMMISSIONERS, YOUR STATE REPS, 
YOUR STATE SENATORS, MAKE SURE 
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T 
WORRYING ABOUT MILLAGE RATES AND
SAVING MONEY.
THIS IS A TIME TO SAVE LIVES.
WE NEED MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND
DEPUTIES.
THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO WORRY 
ABOUT HOW MANY DOLLARS MIGHT BE 
SAVED IF WE DON'T HAVE A DEPUTY 
HERE OR A POLICE OFFICER HERE.
THIS IS NATIONWIDE.
WE NEED MORE HEROES, MORE FIRST 
RESPONDERS, NOT LESS FIRST 
RESPONDERS.
AND I KNOW MANY STATES HAVE 
DIFFERENT TERMS TO HELP OUR 
MENTALLY ILL.
WE ALL PRAY FOR OUR MENTALLY ILL
AND PRAY FOR THEM TO RECOVER.
WE ALL KNOW SOMEONE OR A FAMILY 
WHO IS AFFECTED BY SOMEONE 
SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS.
THE BAKER ACT IN FLORIDA ALLOWS 
LAW ENFORCEMENT OR MEDICAL 
PROFESSIONALS TO CONFINE A 
PERSON INVOLUNTARILY WHILE THEY 
GET EXAMINED AN LOOKED AT.
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REASON 
THAT THEY'RE A THREAT TO 
THEMSELVES OR SOMEONE ELSE.
WHAT I'M ASKING OUR LAWMAKERS TO
DO IS GO BACK TO PLACES LIKE 
TALLAHASSEE AND WASHINGTON, D.C.
AND GIVE POLICE THE POWER IF 
THEY SEE SOMETHING ON SOCIAL 
MEDIA, IF THEY SEE GRAPHIC 
PICTURES OF RIFLES AND BLOOD AND
GORE AND GUNS AND BOMBS, IF THEY
SEE SOMETHING HORRIFIC LANGUAGE,
IF THEY SEE A PERSON TALKING 
ABOUT I WANT TO GROW UP TO BE A 
SERIAL KILLER, WE NEED TO HAVE 
THE POWER TO TAKE THAT PERSON 
AND BRING THEM BEFORE A MENTAL 
HEALTH PROFESSIONAL AT THAT 
PARTICULAR TIME.
INVOLUNTARILY AND HAVE THEM 
EXAMINED.
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE 
RIGHTFULLY SO CONCERNED ABOUT 
THEIR RIGHTS AS AM I.
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF 
THESE STUDENTS.
WHAT ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF YOUNG 
KIDS WHO GO TO SCHOOLS WITH BOOK
BAGS AND PENCILS, DON'T THEY 
HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE PROTECTED 
BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT 
TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY?
THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE DOING.
ANY QUESTIONS?
>> SHERIFF, THE CONDITION OF THE
PEOPLE INJURED?
>> COACH FEIS.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE INCIDENT 
YET OR WHAT HIS PERFORMANCE WAS 
BUT I KNOW AARON PERSONALLY.
I COACHED WITH HIM.
MY TWO BOYS PLAYED FOR HIM.
I DON'T KNOW WHEN AARON'S 
FUNERAL IS.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY ADULTS ARE
GOING TO GO BUT YOU'LL GET 2,000
KIDS THERE.
THE KIDS IN THIS COMMUNITY LOVED
AND ADORED HIM.
HE WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST 
PEOPLE I KNEW.
HE WAS A PHENOMENAL MAN.
I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS YET.
BUT I COULD TELL YOU WHAT, WHEN 
AARON FEIS DIED WHEN HE WAS 
KILLED, TRAGICALLY HE DID IT 
PROTECTING OTHERS.
YOU CAN GUARANTEE THAT BECAUSE 
THAT'S WHO HE WAS. 
>> CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE 
CONDITION THOSE INJURED, WHAT 
ARE THE EXTENTS OF THEIR 
INJURIES AND WHAT KIND DID THEY 
HAVE?
>> WE ARE FORTUNATE TODAY TO 
HAVE OUR DOCTORS WHO WORKED SO 
TIRELESSLY AND SAVE SO MANY 
LIVES YESTERDAY SO WE'RE GOING 
TO BRING UP ONE OF OUR DOCTORS 
TO SPEAK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWER THOSE 
QUESTIONS.
DOCTOR.
>> THANK YOU.
GOOD AFTERNOON.
DR. EVAN BOYAR, DIRECTOR AND 
CHAIRMAN OF THE DEPARTMENT OF 
EMERGENCY MEDICINE AT BROWARD 
HEALTH NORTH AND I ALSO HAVE 
COLLEAGUES FROM BROWARD HEALTH 
MAIN HERE.
AND THE THREE OF US COLLECTIVELY
HOPEFULLY COULD ANSWER SOME OF 
THOSE QUESTIONS.
SO FOR STARTERS, JUST BECAUSE 
WE'RE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS 
DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NUMB TO THE 
EMOTIONS AND WE SEND OUT OUR 
SYMPATHY TO ALL THE FAMILIES 
INVOLVED.
THE WORST THING IS A PARENT IS 
IF YOUR KID DOESN'T COME HOME 
FROM SCHOOL THAT DAY HITS HOME 
PRETTY HARD AND WE SYMPATHIZE 
FOR THEM.
WITH THAT BEING SAID, NOWADAYS 
UNFORTUNATELY WE DO DRILLS FOR 
THIS.
ABOUT NINE MONTHS AGO WE DID A 
DRILL AT OUR FACILITY 
SPECIFICALLY FOR AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER.
SO WHEN IT BECOMES A LIVE EVENT,
WE CAN WORK SEAMLESSLY WITH FIRE
RESCUES, BSO IN ORDER TO ENSURE 
PATIENT SAFETY.
I WANT TO COMMEND THE 
PREHOSPITAL PERSONNEL YESTERDAY 
FOR THEIR EFFORTS AND ALL THE 
EFFORTS AT BROWARD HEALTH NORTH,
BROWARD HEALTH MAIN AND CORAL 
SPRINGS MEDICAL CENTER GOT A 
COUPLE OF PATIENTS AS WELL.
SPECIFICALLY TO BROWARD HEALTH 
NORTH, AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO 
DR. MENENDEZ ABOUT BROWARD 
HEALTH MAIN.
WE HAD A TOTAL OF NINE PATIENTS.
ONE WAS THE SUSPECT TREATED AND 
RELEASED.
WE HAD TWO PATIENTS DECEASED.
THREE PATIENTS HAVE BEEN 
DISCHARGED.
WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE PATIENTS
IN THE HOSPITAL.
ONE WITH AN EXTREMITY WOUND WHO 
IS DOING WELL AND WORKING WITH 
PHYSICAL THERAPY AND ANOTHER 
PATIENT STILL INTUBATED AFTER 
PENETRATING TRAUMA TO THE CHEST 
BUT DOING WELL AND FOLLOWING 
COMMANDS AND A THIRD PATIENT 
THAT REMAINS INTUBATED IN 
CRITICAL CONDITION.
DR. MENENDEZ.
>> I'M THE DIRECTOR FOR THE 
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OF BROWARD 
HEALTH MEDICAL CENTER.
YESTERDAY WAS A TRAGEDY THAT WE 
AS A TEAM TOOK CARE OF THESE 
PATIENTS.
WE ARE A FACILITY.
WE SAW SEVEN PATIENTS.
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWO PATIENTS 
THAT ARE CRITICAL/STABLE 
CONDITION.
THE OTHER FIVE WENT HOME OR ON 
THEIR WAY HOME AND THEY'RE IN 
GOOD CONDITION.
THE OTHER TWO, STABLE CONDITION.
I HAVE DR. FUENTE.
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS HE CAN
TELL YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
I'M THE TRAUMA MEDICAL DIRECTOR 
AT BROWARD HEALTH MEDICAL 
CENTER.
UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS BECOMING 
ROUTINE FOR US NOW.
THIS IS THE SECOND EPISODE WE 
HAVE HAD IN A YEAR.
WHICH IS VERY SAD.
THE FIRST THING I WANT TO SAY IS
THAT THIS SECOND TIME AROUND 
JUST LIKE THE FIRST TIME AROUND,
THE FIRST RESPONDERS DID A 
TERRIFIC JOB.
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO UNDERSTAND 
WHAT WE DO IN TRAUMA, TIME IS OF
THE ESSENCE AND REALLY THE 
DELIVERY OF THOSE PATIENTS WAS 
FANTASTIC YESTERDAY.
IT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE
OUTCOMES.
AS DR. MENENDEZ SAID WE RECEIVED
SEVEN PATIENTS, ONE WAS 
DISCHARGED LAST NIGHT.
WE HAD ONE THAT WAS IN CRITICAL 
CONDITION THAT WENT TO SURGERY.
WE HAD TWO MORE STABLE PATIENTS 
THAT ALSO REQUIRED SURGERY.
WE HAD -- THERE'S STILL OUT OF 
THE SIX LEFT IN THIS OF THE.
HOPING TO SEND TWO HOME TODAY.
BUT I EXPECT FULL RECOVERY.
>> CAN YOU PLEASE TELL US ARE 
YOU PREPARED TO TELL US THAT 
NIKOLAS CRUZ IS THE SAME PERSON 
THAT WROTE THE YOUTUBE COMMENT?
CAN YOU COMMENT ABOUT THE 
YOUTUBE POST?
>> WE DO NOT KNOW IF IT'S THE 
SAME PERSON.
WE DID OUR DATABASE CHECKING AND
COULD NOT POSITIVELY IDENTIFYING
HIM AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT 
AGAIN.
BUT I'M NOT WILLING TO SAY AT 
THIS TIME IT WAS THE SAME 
PERSON.
>> SHERIFF -- 
>> IS THERE ANY INDICATION THAT 
SOMEONE WAS SPECIFICALLY 
TARGETED THAT STARTED ALL OF 
THIS?
>> NOT AT THIS TIME.
THAT'S CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY.
THE FBI, THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT 
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND BROWARD 
SHERIFF'S OFFICE WILL BE WORKING
CON JUNG ACTIVELY TO INTERVIEW 
AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN SO DOWN
THE ROAD WE CAN UNCOVER THIS 
INFORMATION.
RIGHT NOW IT'S NO MORE THAN A 
POSSIBILITY. 
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW HE GOT IN?
>> WE WILL SPEAK ABOUT THAT.
WE DO KNOW ABOUT THAT AND AT OUR
NEXT PRESS CONFERENCE I WILL 
TAKE THE MEDIA THROUGH A 
TIMELINE AND TALK ABOUT THROUGH 
VIDEOTAPES, WE'LL MATCH UP VIDEO
WITH REALTIME INFORMATION AND 
DISSEMINATE THAT.
>> WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT 
HOW HE OBTAINED THE AR-15?
WE UNDERSTAND IT WAS LEGALLY 
BOUGHT. 
>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO RELEASE 
THAT UNTIL LATER TODAY IF WE DO 
AT ALL TODAY.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ALCOHOL, 
TOBACCO AND FIREARMS, THOSE 
INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO 
TRACK DOWN, THE HISTORY OF THIS 
WEAPON.
WE BELIEVE WE KNOW WHERE THE 
WEAPON WAS PURCHASED, WHERE THE 
WEAPON CAME FROM.
BUT THAT'S BEING PIECED 
TOGETHER.
SO THAT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT 
WE WILL DISCUSS AT THE 
APPROPRIATE TIMES.
>> THERE WERE SHOOTINGS LAST 
YEAR AND NOW THIS TRAGIC 
SHOOTING.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL THE PEOPLE, 
WHAT ELSE -- 
>> AS I SAID, I TALK ABOUT THIS 
ALL THE TIME, IT'S NOT A PHRASE,
IT'S NOT A TERM, IT'S THE WAY WE
HAVE TO LIVE OUR LIVES.
IF WE SEE SOMETHING WE NEED TO 
SAY SOMETHING.
IF THAT NEIGHBOR COMES HOME 
EVERY FRIDAY AT 4:00 AND HE OR 
SHE IS ALWAYS CARRYING A GROCERY
BAG AND THE LAST TWO FRIDAYS 
THEY HAVE GONE TO A RANGE AND 
COME BACK WITH BULLETS IN THE 
BAG ON FRIDAYS, THAT'S A CHANGE 
IN BEHAVIOR.
THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT.
YOU KNOW, YOUR OUR EYES AND 
EARS.
ONE COMMUNITY MEMBER WHO SEES 
SOMETHING CAN DO MORE THAN 
SOMETIMES LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN DO
IN A PERIOD OF MONTHS.
RIGHT NOW IF YOU KNOW ANYBODY 
AND SAYING THIS RAISES A RED 
FLAG, I WAS THINKING OF CALLING,
DON'T THINK ABOUT CALLING, CALL 
US.
CALL THE FBI.
CALL THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF 
LAW ENFORCEMENT.
CALL THE BROWARD SHERIFF'S 
OFFICE BUT IF YOU HAVE -- IF 
THERE'S SOMETHING IN YOUR GUT 
THAT TELLS YOU SOMETHING NOT 
RIGHT WITH THIS PERSON, THIS 
PERSON HAS THE CAPABILITIES IN 
MY MIND TO DO THIS OR THAT, 
PLEASE DON'T REMAIN SILENT AND 
LET US KNOW ABOUT IT.
>> CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY HE WAS 
EXPELLED?
>> ALL THE WAY BACK TO -- 
WAS HE ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S 
RADAR?
WHAT WAS DONE ABOUT IT BECAUSE 
PEOPLE HAVE KNOWN FOR HIM YEARS 
ALREADY PRIOR TO. 
>> HOW DID HE GET BACK ON 
CAMPUS?
>> WHY WAS HE EXPELLED?
>> YOU KNOW, AS A SCHOOL 
DISTRICT, WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE
PRIVACY OF OUR STUDENTS.
SO I CAN'T GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT 
THE STUDENT'S RECORD AND 
PERSONAL INFORMATION.
I WILL TELL YOU IT WAS A FORMER 
STUDENT AT STONEMAN DOUGLAS 
BECAUSE OF ISSUES THAT AROSE 
HERE, HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO 
ANOTHER SCHOOL WITHIN THE 
COUNTY. 
>> WAS IT A TROUBLED SCHOOL?
>> AGAIN, I'M NOT PRIVILEGED TO 
PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION AT THE 
MOMENT.
BUT IT IS A STUDENT THAT WE HAVE
BEEN PROVIDING SUPPORTS FOR AND 
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE CERTAINLY 
WERE CHALLENGES.
THE SPECIFICS I CAN'T GET INTO.
AS FAR AS A STUDENT COMING ON 
CAMPUS, THIS PARTICULAR 
INDIVIDUAL CAME ON TO CAMPUS AT 
THE TIME OF DISMISSAL AND THAT 
IS A FAIRLY OPEN TIME FOR THE 
CAMPUS AND HE ENTERED THE 
FACILITY AT THAT MOMENT.
>> IS THERE A DISCIPLINARY 
RECORD HAVING BEEN EXPELLED AND 
ENROLLED IN ANOTHER SCHOOL, THE 
DISTRICT KNEW HE WAS OUT THERE, 
HE HAD PROBLEMS IN THE PAST, 
CORRECT?
>> LET ME SAY THIS.
WHEN WE HAVE STUDENTS WITHIN OUR
CARE IN THE DISTRICT, WE PROVIDE
THE SERVICES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE
THEM.
THIS IS BIGGER THAN JUST THE 
SCHOOL SYSTEM.
OUR KIDS ARE OUT OF OUR SCHOOLS 
TWO-THIRDS OF THE TIME THEY'RE 
UP.
WE NEED A COMMUNITY-WIDE 
APPROACH TO HELPING OUR STUDENTS
WITH CHALLENGES AND MENTAL 
HEALTH CONCERNS.
AGAIN, WE HAVE GOT TO INVEST 
RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE WE 
MINIMIZE THE OCCURRENCE OF THIS 
EVER HAPPENING AGAIN BECAUSE IF 
WE DON'T, IT'S NOT A MATTER OF 
IF, IT'S GOING TO BE WHEN.
>> SHERIFF, DO YOU KNOW IF THERE
WAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGER WITH
THIS STUDENT FOR THIS EVENT?
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.
>> WHERE ARE YOU GUYS PROCESSING
THE SCENE?
>> THERE ARE SOME BODIES STILL 
IN THE SCHOOL.
THERE'S A -- RIGHT NOW THE FOCUS
OF THE FBI AND THE BROWARD 
SHERIFF'S OFFICE IS ON THE 
SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION OF THIS 
KILLER.
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE ANY
STONE UNTURNED.
WE'RE TRYING TO PROCESS THIS AS 
QUICKLY AS WE CAN.
BUT INVESTIGATORS ARE INVOLVED.
THERE'S SCIENCE, DNA AND A WHOLE
PLETHORA OF THINGS.
WE WANT TO GO FAST BUT WE'RE NOT
GOING TO RUSH IT.
WE'RE GOING TO GET IT RIGHT 
BEFORE WE GET IT FAST.
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT 
NOW.
>> WHAT WAS THE CONVERSATION 
ABOUT SITUATIONS LIKE THIS -- 
>> DO STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL 
KNOW -- THEY WERE CONCERNED 
ABOUT A CLASSMATE, IS THERE A 
PROTOCOL?
>> I'M SURE THERE IS.
THERE IS A PROCESS.
THEY CAN GET AHOLD OF TEACHERS, 
GUIDANCE COUNSELLORS, MAKE 
ANONYMOUS CALLS TO CRIME 
STOPPERS.
IF SOMEBODY KNOWS SOMETHING 
THERE'S CERTAINLY AMPLE WAY TO 
SAY YES. 
>> GOVERNOR SCOTT, IS THERE A 
WAY -- 
>> WE HAD A SCHOOL RESOURCE 
DEPUTY, DEPUTY PETERSON ON 
CAMPUS AND HE WAS ARMED.
HE NEVER ENCOUNTERED AT THIS 
POINT THE ONLY THING I CAN TELL 
YOU IS HE NEVER ENCOUNTERED 
CRUZ.
>> YOU SAID YOU WOULD HAVE A 
REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO 
PREVENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS FROM
HAPPENING.
DOES THAT REAL CONVERSATION TELL
THE STATE THAT'S SOMETHING WE'LL
LOOK INTO?
>> TWO THINGS I WANT TO FOCUS ON
WHEN I HAVE THIS CONVERSATION 
NEXT WEEK IS I WANT TO FOCUS ON 
SCHOOL SAFETY AND THAT'S GOING 
TO FOCUS ON DOLLARS, IT'S GOING 
TO FOCUS AS THE SUPERINTENDENT 
SAID ON MENTAL HEALTH, DOLLARS.
WE HAVE GOT TO THINK ABOUT THIS.
IF SOMEBODY IS MENTALLY ILL THEY
SHOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A GUN.
I WANT TO FOCUS ON BOTH THINGS.
I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE SPEAKER OF 
THE HOUSE AND THEY'RE RECEPTIVE 
TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT 
SCHOOL SAFETY.
ALL OF US HAVE CHILDREN, OUR 
GRANDCHILDREN, NIECES OR NEPHEWS
AND NONE OF US WANT ANYTHING 
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN AGAIN.
I SHOULD SAY SOMETHING IN 
SPA
SPANISH.
>> GOVERNOR, IT SEEMED LIKE 
THERE'S A BIG FOCUS ON MENTALLY 
ILL.
IS HE MENTALLY ILL OR ARE WE 
ASSUMING BECAUSE HE KILLED SO 
MANY PEOPLE?
>> I THINK IT'S A PRETTY GOOD 
ASSUMPTION TO START OUT WITH, 
YES.
>> GOVERNOR, SHOULD YOU FORECAST
FOR US THE CONVERSATION YOU PLAN
TO HAVE?
HOW WILL THEY BE DIFFERENT FROM 
THE CONVERSATIONS YOU -- 
>> LET'S REMEMBER THIS.
FIRST OFF, PULSE WAS A TERRORIST
ATTACK AND AFTER PULSE I ASKED 
FOR MONEY AND THE LEGISLATURE 
SUPPORTED ADDING MORE 
COUNTERTERRORISM EXPERTS THROUGH
OUR FLORIDA DEPARTMENT LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AND WE DID THAT.
WE ADDED 46 ADDITIONAL.
IN THIS CASE ALL OUR SCHOOLS 
HAVE TO BE SAFE.
SIMPLE AS THAT.
HOW DO WE DO THAT?
IT'S GOING TO BE FUNDING.
IT'S GOING TO BE BOTH FOR 
SECURITY, MENTAL ILLNESS, 
COUNSELLORS.
BUT ON TOP OF THAT, WE'VE GOT TO
SAY TO OURSELVES IF WE HAVE 
SOMEBODY MENTALLY ILL THEY CAN'T
HAVE ACCESS TO A GUN.
BUT LOOK, I'M OPEN TO HAVING A 
CONVERSATION ABOUT THINGS 
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT MY 
CHILDREN, YOUR CHILDREN TO GO 
THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
I DON'T WANT A PARENT TO HAVE TO
SAY I HAVE TO TEACH YOU NOW YOU 
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT A 
SHOOTER.
THAT'S NOT THE SOCIETY WE WANT 
TO LIVE IN.
>> I ALSO -- WE HAVE OUT HERE 
TODAY I'M FLANKED BY MANY OF OUR
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS, ELECTED 
OFFICIALS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD.
A HOST OF OTHERS.
WE APPRECIATE THEM BEING OUT 
HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE 
SURE THEY'RE PART OF THE 
CONVERSATIONS, TOO, BECAUSE THEY
DEEPLY CARE ABOUT THEIR STUDENTS
AND THIS COMMUNITY.
SO I'M GLAD TO SEE THEM HERE 
TODAY.
A FEW MORE QUESTIONS.
>> WHAT HAS CRUZ SAID TO YOU AT 
THIS POINT?
>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO RELEASE 
ANYTHING HE SAID.
>> DO YOU KNOW -- 
>> SEEN SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS 
REPORT IT.
IF SOMEONE CAME TO YOU WITH 
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS SUSPECT 
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE LEGALLY DONE
ABOUT THE FACT HE OWNED A GUN?
>> WELL, IF THE HE LEGALLY OWNED
A GUN WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING 
ABOUT ARRESTING HIM FOR HAVING A
GUN BECAUSE YOU USED THE WORD 
LEGALLY.
BUT WE COULD CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP
AND GO TO VISIT HIM WHETHER HE 
LEGALLY OWNS A GUN OR NOT.
IF A RED FLAG GOES UP AND 
SOMETHING NOT RIGHT AND WE THINK
THIS PERSON HAS A PROPENSITY TO 
DO SUCH A HORRIFIC ACT I THINK 
POLICE ALL OVER THIS NATION NEED
TO BE EMPOWERED TO TAKE THAT 
PERSON AND MEDICALLY DELIVER HIM
TO A MEDICAL FACILITY WHERE THEY
CAN BE EXAMINED.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
WE'LL BE BACK IN ABOUT AN HOUR.
>> AS YOU CAN SEE WE'RE STILL 
WAITING ALSO FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP
FOR HIS REMARKS.
HE HAS TWEETED BUT NOT SAID 
ANYTHING ON CAMERA AND WE'RE 
AWAITING HIS REMARKS.
BROWARD COUNTY SHERIFF SCOTT 
ISRAEL BEGAN THAT PRESS 
CONFERENCE SAYING ALL 17 
FAMILIES HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED 
ABOUT THE LOSS OF THEIR LOVED 
ONES AND THAT THE GUNMAN, THE 
19-YEAR-OLD HAS BEEN CHARGED 17 
CHARGES THAT HE IS FACING OF 
PREMEDITATED MURDER.
EARLIER TOM LLAMAS WAS OUTSIDE 
NIKOLAS CRUZ'S HOME AND NOW HE 
IS OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.
TOM.
>> Reporter: ROBIN GOOD MORNING 
TO YOU AND WE HAVE JUST LEARNED 
ALSO THAT NIKOLAS CRUZ WILL 
APPEAR BEFORE A JUDGE AT 2:00 
AND ONE OF THE STUNNING 
REVELATIONS WE HEARD ACTUALLY 
CAME FROM THE FBI.
THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE WAS
A YOUTUBE CHANNEL WHERE 
APPARENTLY NIKOLAS CRUZ HAD 
POSTED MONTHS AGO A COMMENT THAT
BASICALLY READ I'M GOING TO BE A
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL SHOOTER.
NOW A YOUTUBE BLOGGER NOTIFIED 
THE FBI AND SENT THEM A SCREEN 
SHOT BUT THE FBI SAYS THEY HAD 
NO OTHER INFORMATION THAT WAS 
INCLUDED WITH THAT COMMENT WHICH
COULD INDICATE A TIME OR 
LOCATION OR IDENTITY OF THE 
PERSON.
THE FBI SAYS THEY CONDUCTED A 
DATABASE REVIEW CHECKS BUT THEY 
WERE NOT ABLE TO LOCATE WHO 
EXACTLY NIKOLAS CRUZ WAS EVEN 
THOUGH HIS USER NAME WAS THE 
SAME NAME HE HAS.
THAT WAS A BIG REVELATION.
ALL 17 FAMILIES HAVE BEEN 
NOTIFIED.
UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THIS 
INVESTIGATION AT WORK AND 
INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN WORKING 
THROUGH THE NIGHT AT THE SCHOOL 
WHICH IS JUST BEHIND ME, SOME OF
THE VICTIMS' BODIES ARE STILL 
THERE BECAUSE THIS INVESTIGATION
IS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME.
BOTH THE BROWARD SHERIFF'S 
OFFICE, THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT 
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FBI ARE 
ALL WORKING ON THIS TOGETHER.
AT 2:00 P.M. WE MAY GET ONE OF 
OUR FIRST LOOKS TODAY AT THE 
SUSPECT NIKOLAS CRUZ WHEN HE 
APPEARS BEFORE THAT JUDGE, 
ROBIN. 
>> TOM, I KNOW YOU'LL STAY ON 
THE SITUATION THERE.
WE ARE EXPECTING AGAIN FOR 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO MAKE HIS 
REMARKS.
HE DID SEND OUT TWEETS BUT THIS 
WILL BE HIS FIRST ON CAMERA 
REMARKS.
HE'LL BE SPEAKING FROM THE 
DIPLOMATIC ROOM AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE.
I WAS ALSO STRUCK BY SOMETHING 
THAT THE SHERIFF SAID WHEN HE 
WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS IS A DAY 
OF MOURNING OF COURSE.
AND ALSO BEING VERY RESPECTFUL 
OF THE FAMILIES, THE LOVED ONES 
BUT HE SAID IN THE DAYS AHEAD HE
WOULD ANIMATED ABOUT THE 
DISCUSSION.
MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE 
SHERIFF AND ALSO GOVERNOR RICK 
SCOTT WERE ASKING ABOUT GUN 
CONTROL.
WE HEARD FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT
WHO SAID THAT IN TALKING WITH 
THE STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY 
RECEIVING COUNSELING THAT THEY 
ASKED THEIR PARENTS, OTHER 
PEOPLE ABOUT SENSIBLE GUN 
CONTROL LAWS.
THE STUDENTS THERE HAVING GONE 
THROUGH THIS ARE NOW ASKING 
ABOUT THAT AND THAT IS A 
DISCUSSION THAT WILL BE TAKING 
PLACE AT SOME POINT.
I WANT TO GO TO OUR CHIEF 
JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT PIERRE 
THOMAS.
THE FBI AGENT THAT WAS THERE WAS
SAYING THEY WERE AWARE OF THAT 
YOUTUBE POSTING BUT AS WE HEARD 
WITH TOM, THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO 
GET ANY MORE INFORMATION 
DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE SHOOTER.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, ROBIN.
CLEARLY, THERE'S GOING TO BE 
MORE WORK DONE IN TERMS OF WHERE
THE SIGNS WERE MISSED.
I ALSO WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT 
THAT THEY MENTIONED THERE'S 
STILL BODIES IN THE ROOM, IN THE
SCHOOL.
ROBIN. 
>> HERE'S THE PRESIDENT.
>> MY FELLOW AMERICANS.
TODAY I SPEAK TO A NATION IN 
GRIEF.
YESTERDAY A SCHOOL FILLED WITH 
INNOCENT CHILDREN AND CARING 
TEACHERS BECAME THE SCENE OF 
TERRIBLE VIOLENCE, HATRED AND 
EVIL.
AROUND 2:30 YESTERDAY AFTERNOON 
POLICE RESPONDED TO REPORTS OF 
GUNFIRE AT MARJORY STONEMAN 
DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL IN PARKLAND,
FLORIDA.
A GREAT AND SAFE COMMUNITY.
THERE A SHOOTER WHO IS NOW IN 
CUSTODY OPENED FIRE ON 
DEFENSELESS STUDENTS AND 
TEACHERS.
HE MURDERED 17 PEOPLE AND BADLY 
WOUNDED AT LEAST 14 OTHERS.
OUR ENTIRE NATION WITH ONE HEAVY
HEART IS PRAYING FOR THE VICTIMS
AND THEIR FAMILIES.
TO EVERY PARENT, TEACHER AND 
CHILD WHO IS HURTING SO BADLY, 
WE ARE HERE FOR YOU, WHATEVER 
YOU NEED, WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO 
EASE YOUR PAIN.
WE ARE ALL JOINED TOGETHER AS 
ONE AMERICAN FAMILY.
AND YOUR SUFFERING IS OUR BURDEN
ALSO.
NO CHILD, NO TEACHER SHOULD EVER
BE IN DANGER IN AN AMERICAN 
SCHOOL.
NO PARENT SHOULD EVER HAVE TO 
FEAR FOR THEIR SONS AND 
DAUGHTERS WHEN THEY KISS THEM 
GOODBYE IN THE MORNING.
EACH PERSON WHO WAS STOLEN FROM 
US YESTERDAY HAD A FULL LIFE 
AHEAD OF THEM.
A LIFE FILLED WITH WONDROUS 
BEAUTY AND UNLIMITED POTENTIAL 
AND PROMISE.
EACH ONE HAD DREAMS TO PURSUE, 
LOVE TO GIVE AND TALENTS TO 
SHARE WITH THE WORLD.
AND EACH ONE HAD A FAMILY TO 
WHOM THEY MEANT EVERYTHING IN 
THE WORLD.
TODAY WE MOURN FOR ALL OF THOSE 
WHO LOST THEIR LIVES.
WE COMFORT THE GRIEVING AND THE 
WOUNDED.
AND WE HURT FOR THE ENTIRE 
COMMUNITY OF PARKLAND, FLORIDA 
THAT IS NOW IN SHOCK AND PAIN 
AND SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS.
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, FIRST 
RESPONDERS AND TEACHERS WHO 
RESPONDED SO BRAVELY IN THE FACE
OF DANGER, WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR
COURAGE.
SOON AFTER THE SHOOTER I SPOKE 
WITH GOVERNOR SCOTT TO CONVEY 
OUR DEEPEST SYMPATHIES TO THE 
PEOPLE OF FLORIDA AND OUR 
DETERMINATION TO ASSIST IN ANY 
WAY THAT WE CAN.
I ALSO SPOKE WITH FLORIDA 
ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BUNDY AND 
BROWARD COUNTY SHERIFF SCOTT 
ISRAEL.
I'M MAKING PLANS TO VISIT 
PARKLAND TO MEET WITH FAMILIES 
AND LOCAL OFFICIALS AND TO 
CONTINUE COORDINATING THE 
FEDERAL RESPONSE.
IN THESE MOMENTS OF HEARTACHE 
AND DARKNESS WE HOLD ON TO GOD'S
WORD IN SCRIPTURE, I HAVE HEARD 
YOUR PRAYER AND SEEN YOUR TEARS,
I WILL HEAL YOU.
WE TRUST IN THAT PROMISE AND WE 
HOLD FAST TO OUR FELLOW 
AMERICANS IN THEIR TIME OF 
SORROW.
I WANT TO SPEAK NOW DIRECTLY TO 
AMERICA'S CHILDREN.
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO FEEL LOST, 
ALONE, CONFUSED OR EVEN SCARED.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE 
NEVER ALONE AND YOU NEVER WILL 
BE.
YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT 
YOU.
WHO LOVE YOU.
AND WHO WILL DO ANYTHING AT ALL 
TO PROTECT YOU.
IF YOU NEED HELP, TURN TO A 
TEACHER, A FAMILY MEMBER, A 
LOCAL POLICE OFFICER OR A FAITH 
LEADER.
ANSWER HATE WITH LOVE.
ANSWER CRUELTY WITH KINDNESS.
WE MUST ALSO WORK TOGETHER TO 
CREATE A CULTURE IN OUR COUNTRY 
THAT EMBRACES THE DIGNITY OF 
LIFE THAT CREATES DEEP AND 
MEANINGFUL HUMAN CONNECTIONS AND
THAT TURNS CLASSMATES AND 
COLLEAGUES INTO FRIENDS AND 
NEIGHBORS.
OUR ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING 
CLOSELY WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
TO INVESTIGATE THE SHOOTING AND 
LEARN EVERYTHING WE CAN.
WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH
STATE AND LOCAL LEADERS TO HELP 
SECURE OUR SCHOOLS AND TACKLE 
THE DIFFICULT ISSUE OF MENTAL 
HEALTH.
LATER THIS MONTH I WILL BE 
MEETING WITH THE NATION'S 
GOVERNORS AND ATTORNEY GENERALS.
WE'RE MAKING OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR
CHILDREN SAFER WILL BE OUR TOP 
PRIORITY.
IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY TAKE 
ACTIONS THAT MAKE US FEEL LIKE 
WE ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE.
WE MUST ACTUALLY MAKE THAT 
DIFFERENCE.
IN TIMES OF TRAGEDY, THE BONDS 
THAT SUSTAIN US ARE THOSE OF 
FAMILY, FAITH, COMMUNITY AND 
COUNTRY.
THESE BONDS ARE STRONGER THAN 
THE FORCES OF HATRED AND EVIL 
AND THESE BONDS GROW EVEN 
STRONGER IN THE HOURS OF OUR 
GREATEST NEED.
AND SO ALWAYS BUT ESPECIALLY 
TODAY, LET US HOLD OUR LOVED 
ONES CLOSE, LET US PRAY FOR 
HEALING AND FOR PEACE AND LET US
COME TOGETHER AS ONE NATION TO 
WIPE AWAY THE TEARS AND STRIVE 
FOR A MUCH BETTER TOMORROW.
THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU ALL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD 
HEAR THAT.
HE WAS ASKED JUST THEN WOULD HE 
DO ANYTHING ABOUT GUNS.
HE DID NOT ADDRESS THAT.
HE DID TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH 
BUT THAT WAS THE QUESTION 
SHOUTED TO HIM AS HE WAS 
LEAVING.
HE HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH 
OFFICIALS THERE IN FLORIDA AND 
SAYS HE WILL MAKE A TRIP TO 
PARKLAND, FLORIDA AS WELL.
OUR SENIOR WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT CECELIA VEGA, 
PEOPLE ARE AWAITING TO HEAR FROM
THE PRESIDENT AND HE HAS NOW 
SPOKEN. 
>> Reporter: AND THIS IS THE 
FOURTH TIME THIS PRESIDENT HAS 
HAD TO MAKE AN ADDRESS TO THE 
NATION IN THE WAKE OF A MASS 
SHOOTING.
THAT QUESTION AS HE WALKED OUT 
OF THE ROOM, WILL HE DO ANYTHING
ABOUT GUNS AS IT RELATES TO GUN 
CONTROL LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY, 
THAT IS GOING TO BE THE MAJOR 
QUESTION.
NOT JUST FOR THIS WHITE HOUSE 
BUT THIS CONGRESS OF COURSE.
THE PRESIDENT TOUCHED IN HIS 
REMARKS ON THE ISSUE OF MENTAL 
ILLNESS AS IT RELATES TO THESE 
MASS SHOOTINGS.
THAT IS SOMETHING HE TOUCHED ON 
IN A TWEET THIS MORNING.
WE HEARD THAT TWEET RIGHT THERE 
ON YOUR SCREEN, THE PRESIDENT 
SAYING SO MANY SIGNS THAT THE 
FLORIDA SHOOTER WAS MENTALLY 
DISTURBED.
THIS IS AN ECHO WE HEARD FROM 
THE DELEGATION IN FLORIDA.
THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA SAYING 
PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS 
SHOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO GUNS.
ROBIN, ONE OF THE THINGS GOING 
FORWARD THAT THIS WHITE HOUSE 
WILL BE CONFRONTED WITH IS THE 
FACT THAT ONE OF THE OTHER MAJOR
ACTIONS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
TAKEN ON GUN CONTROL IS TO BLOCK
AN OBAMA-ERA RULE THAT MADE IT 
HARDER FOR THE MENTALLY ILL TO 
HAVE ACCESS TO GUNS AND THIS IS 
A PRESIDENT WHO HAS NOT WANTED 
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF GUN 
CONTROL.
HE HAS SAID IT IS TOO SOON TO DO
SO PARTICULARLY WHEN AN 
INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING.
BUT WE ARE HEARING NOT JUST FROM
PEOPLE IN FLORIDA, PERHAPS, WE 
ARE SEEING AT THIS MOMENT FROM 
SOME IN HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION, 
THE TREASURY SECRETARY NOT LONG 
AGO SAYING THAT PERSONALLY I 
THINK GUN VIOLENCE IS A TRAGEDY 
AND URGE CONGRESS TO LOOK AT 
THESE ISSUES.
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING A 
STATEMENT, A SENTIMENT EXPRESSED
FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION WE HAVE
HEARD SO FAR.
THE PRESIDENT MADE NEWS AND 
SAYING HE WILL BE VISITING 
PARKLAND.
HE IS SCHEDULED TO GO TO HIS 
MAR-A-LAGO RESORT THIS WEEKEND.
THAT IS JUST 40 MILES AWAY FROM 
WHERE THAT TRAGEDY TOOK PLACE.
I DO KNOW FROM SOURCES HERE IN 
THIS WHITE HOUSE THERE IS ACTIVE
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE 
PRESIDENT MIGHT MAKE THAT VISIT 
THIS WEEKEND.
AGAIN ROBIN, THE BIG QUESTION 
GOING FORWARD, WHEN IS THE TIME 
IF NOT NOW TO TALK ABOUT GUN 
CONTROL PERHAPS THIS IS THE 
SHOOTING THAT WILL INSPIRE THEM 
TO TAKE UP THIS POLICY 
DISCUSSION.
>> THANK YOU.
ONE OF THE TRENDING HASHTAGS, 
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND OFTEN AFTER
A SHOOTING LIKE THIS, IT'S TOO 
SOON TO SPEAK ABOUT SENSIBLE GUN
CONTROL BUT MANY PEOPLE SAY 
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND WHEN IS THE
RIGHT TIME?
TOM LLAMAS IS OUTSIDE OF THE 
SCHOOL.
YOU HAVE BEEN THERE SINCE 
YESTERDAY.
WHAT IS THE SENSE THAT YOU'RE 
FEELING RIGHT NOW?
>> Reporter: WE'RE SEEING PEOPLE
COME WITH ROSES AND BALLOONS.
WE JUST SAW SOME STUDENTS HERE 
FROM A NEARBY SCHOOL SORT OF 
BREAK DOWN DURING THAT NEWS 
CONFERENCE AS IT WAS GOING ON.
BUT AS FAR AS THE ISSUE OF GUN 
LAWS GOES, AS YOU AND CECILIA 
WERE DISCUSSING, AS WE FIRST 
REPORTED ON "GMA" THE ALLEGED 
SHOOTER NIKOLAS CRUZ PURCHASED 
THAT AR RIFLE LEGALLY.
AND WE COULD EXPAND ON THAT 
REPORTING.
OUR TEAM HAS CONFIRMED HE 
PURCHASED IT FROM A FEDERALLY 
LICENSED DEALER.
HE'S 19 YEARS OLD AND BOUGHT IT 
WITHIN THE LAST YEAR.
YOU CAN PURCHASE AN AR-15 BY THE
AGE OF 18.
HE FOLLOWED ALL THE RULES AND 
OBTAINED THAT RIFLE, THE MACHINE
HE BROUGHT INTO THIS SCHOOL AND 
KILLED ALL THOSE STUDENTS AND 
TEACHERS WITH, HE OBTAINED THAT 
LEGALLY.
WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT MENTAL 
ILLNESS AND THIS SORT OF FALLS 
UNDER THAT UMBRELLA AS WELL.
WERE THERE WARNING SIGNS?
THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT SAID 
THEY HAD NO WARNING SIGNS.
TODAY HE SAID HE COULDN'T TALK 
ABOUT CRUZ'S RECORD.
BUT WE TALKED TO MULTIPLE 
STUDENTS WHO TOLD US THAT AT 
LEAST ONE STUDENT SAID HE SAID 
HE WANTED TO SHOOT UP THE 
SCHOOL.
HE HAD A PASSION FOR GUNS AND 
CARRIED BULLET CASINGS IN HIS 
BOOK BAG.
FOR SOME REASON THIS CHILD WAS 
ALLOWED TO COME TO SCHOOL AND 
NOT HAVE A BOOK BAG.
IF THOSE AREN'T WARNING SIGNS, I
DON'T KNOW WHAT ARE. 
>> THOSE WERE WARNING SIGNS AND 
THE SCHOOL IS MAINTAINING NO ONE
OFFICIALLY CONTACTED THEM BUT HE
WAS EXPELLED FOR DISCIPLINARY 
REASONS AND WE HEARD ABOUT THOSE
ITEMS THAT HE HAD IN HIS 
BACKPACK.
TOM LLAMAS, THANK YOU.
LET'S PHOTO PIERRE THOMAS AND 
THE FBI OF COURSE IS FULLY 
ENGAGED IN THIS CASE PIERRE.
>> ROBIN, THEY ARE.
WE KNOW BASED ON WHAT THE 
SUPERINTENDENT SAID THIS MORNING
THAT THIS YOUNG MAN WAS GETTING 
SUPPORT.
HE WAS GETTING SUPPORT AND HE 
HAD MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT 
THE SHERIFF IS NOW OPENLY 
TALKING ABOUT AND WE KNOW THAT 
THIS YOUNG MAN WAS ABLE TO BUY 
AN AR-15 ASSAULT RIFLE.
THE SYSTEM DID NOT BLINK RED.
HOW COULD YOU HAVE A YOUNG MAN 
WHO HAD THESE KIND OF ISSUES 
THEN GET THE WEAPON?
THAT'S THE CRITICAL ISSUE.
THE SHERIFF MADE A MAJOR POINT 
ABOUT A CONVERSATION ABOUT 
SOCIAL MEDIA.
SHOULD WHEN PEOPLE POST 
EXTREMELY VIOLENT IMAGES AND 
STATEMENTS ONLINE, SHOULD THE 
AUTHORITIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO 
GO GET THOSE PEOPLE AND GET THEM
BEFORE PROFESSIONALS TO EVALUATE
THEM.
THESE ARE THE CONVERSATIONS 
WE'RE HAVING NOW.
THE POINT I WANTED TO MAKE IS I 
WAS STRUCK WHEN THEY SAID 
THERE'S STILL BODIES INSIDE THAT
SCHOOL AND I THINK WE ALL NEED 
TO KEEP THAT IN MIND TODAY. 
>> AND THAT'S WHAT ALL THE 
OFFICIALS THERE WERE SAYING.
THEY KNOW THAT PEOPLE WANT TO 
GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS 
POSSIBLE.
AND THE FAMILIES THAT'S HOW THEY
BEGAN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, THE 
FAMILIES NOW HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED.
MANY OF THE STUDENTS, THEY 
DIDN'T HAVE ANY ID ON THEM AND 
WE DO NEED TO KEEP THE FAMILIES 
IN OUR HEARTS AND MINDS.
DAVID MUIR HAS MADE HIS WAY DOWN
THERE TO FLORIDA.
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE 
BROADCASTING THERE FROM TONIGHT 
DAVID.
>> ROBIN IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO 
KEEP THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE OF 
WHAT THIS COUNTRY HAS NOW 
WITNESSED IN THE LAST FIVE TO 
SIX MONTHS.
THREE OF THE DEADLIEST MASS 
SHOOTINGS IN MODERN AMERICAN 
TIMES.
IT'S SORT OF EXTRAORDINARY TO 
THINK WE'RE ON THE SCENE IN 
PARKLAND, FLORIDA AFTER BEING IN
TEXAS, THE WORST CHURCH SHOOTING
IN MODERN TIMES.
AFTER LAS VEGAS WHICH WE KNOW IS
NOW THE TOP OF THE LIST FOR HOW 
DEADLY THAT SCENE WAS.
HERE IN FLORIDA, THE STORIES 
THAT YOU HEAR FROM THESE 
STUDENTS AND HOW COMMONPLACE 
THIS HAS BECOME IN THIS COUNTRY.
ABOUT THE DRILL THAT HAPPENED 
EARLIER IN THE DAY AND SO WHEN 
THEY HEARD THE FIRE ALARM PULLED
AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S BELIEVED THE 
SUSPECT PULLED THAT ALARM TO TRY
TO GET TO KIDS AND TEACHERS TO 
RACE OUT OF THE CLASSROOMS DOWN 
THE HALLWAYS, THAT THEY THOUGHT 
IT WAS A LITTLE ODD TO HEAR THAT
ALARM ALL OVER AGAIN, BUT SO IN 
MANY SCHOOLS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY
HAVE BEEN TRAINING THEIR 
STUDENTS WITH DRILLS, ADDITIONAL
PRACTICE ON WHAT TO DO IN THESE 
TYPES OF SITUATIONS.
IT'S BECOME SO COMMONPLACE AND 
PRESIDENT OBAMA FACED THIS ISSUE
BEFORE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT AND
NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESSING 
THIS ISSUE OF GUN VIOLENCE IN 
OUR SCHOOLS AND IN OUR 
COMMUNITIES.
NOW SEVERAL TIMES JUST SINCE 
BECOMING PRESIDENT.
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF SCRUTINY 
NOW ON WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD TO
SAY A SHORT TIME AGO CHOOSING TO
CONCENTRATE ON MENTAL HEALTH AND
I DON'T THINK IN ANY OF THESE 
COMMUNITIES YOU'LL FIND AN 
ARGUMENT THAT MENTAL HEALTH IS 
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT HAS TO BE
LOOKED AT BUT THERE IS ANOTHER 
VITAL COMPONENT AND THAT IS THE 
WEAPONS BEING USED.
IN THIS CASE, THE WEAPON IS 
BELIEVED WAS PURCHASED LEGALLY 
BUT THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN'S PAST, 
WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD HAVE 
HAD A WEAPON AND THE MULTIPLE 
WARNING SIGNS THAT ARE BEGINNING
TO EMERGE ABOUT HIS PAST AND 
WHETHER OR NOT A COMMUNITY COULD
HAVE PUT UP RED FLAGS FAR 
EARLIER AND TRY TO PREVENT 
ANOTHER TRAGEDY LIKE THIS.
BUT ROBIN, IT'S SOMETHING TO BE 
AGAIN IN A COMMUNITY HERE IN 
AMERICA SO QUICKLY AFTER THOSE 
OTHER PLACE THAT IS WE HAVE BEEN
REPORTING ON YET AGAIN ALL OF 
THESE FAMILIES WHO THOUGHT THEIR
CHILDREN WOULD BE COMING HOME 
FROM SCHOOL, GOING TO SPORTS 
PRACTICE AND INSTEAD THEY WAITED
TO HEAR IF THEIR CHILDREN'S 
NAMES WERE ON THAT LIST. 
>> WE TALKED TO MANY STUDENTS ON
"GOOD MORNING AMERICA" AND ONE 
STUDENT IN PARTICULAR STRUCK US 
WHEN HE SAID WE CAN'T GET USED 
TO THIS EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE 
NAMING ALL THE TIMES THAT 
PRESIDENTS AND NOT JUST 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HAD TO BUT 
HIS PREDECESSORS HAVE HAD TO GO 
DOWN TO THESE MEMORIALS AND TO 
HEAR THIS YOUNG MAN SAY IS 
SOMETHING THAT WE CANNOT GET 
USED TO.
THANK YOU, DAVID.
WHO JUST LANDED THERE IN 
FLORIDA.
WE'RE GOING TO RETURN TO OUR 
REGULAR PROGRAM.
IN SOME PARTS THAT'S "GOOD 
MORNING AMERICA" AND DAVID WILL 
HAVE A WRAP-UP ON "WORLD NEWS 
TONIGHT" IN FLORIDA.
