1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,660
One of the mistakes people make about climate
change is saying that the planet is at stake.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,180
"Is it the last chance to save the planet from climate change?"

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,400
"Tens of thousands of activists warning climate change is destroying the earth."

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,180
"The biggest cause in Hollywood is saving the Earth. Climate change and all that."

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,100
That’s not really the right way to think about
it.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,970
Earth has gone through immense climate changes
many, many times before,

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,890
in some cases leading to mass extinctions.
but life persisted. Mammals evolved from reptiles,

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,960
and primates from mammals.
They stood up. And walked out of Africa, eventually

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,250
reaching the corners of every continent.

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,539
But Only after well over 100,000 years of wandering
did the real human innovation happen, when

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,380
12,000 years ago we stopped foraging and started
farming.

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,719
Agriculture meant villages, cities, society,
government: the birth of civilization.

13
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,030
but why did it take so long for humans to
take control of their food? well If you look

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,109
at this chart of global temperature change
going back 100,000 years, you might notice

15
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,180
something special about the last 10,000 years.
That’s when the climate settled into a period

16
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,870
of unusual stability.
It was on this ledge that human society developed,

17
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:18,000
where reliable seasons fed more and more people...where knowledge accumulated and science began.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,670
Until eventually, inventors created machines
that could unleash unimaginable growth and

19
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:28,530
mobility. All they needed was fuel to burn.
and they found it in the form of ancient forests

20
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,240
buried for under dirt and compacted over 300
million years.

21
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,110
With these coal deposits, humans unearthed tons and

22
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,240
tons of carbon that had been locked away long
before our species appeared.

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,400
And that’s how we began to disrupt the climate
that birthed us — the climate that our food

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,960
systems and infrastructure are built upon.
After 10,000 years of temperatures that varied

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,190
only within about 1 degree Celsius, scientists
now say we’re on track for 3 degrees of

26
00:01:54,190 --> 00:02:00,930
warming by 2100 if we don’t change course.
Humans have been around for .004% of Earth’s

27
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,860
history. And of all human history - the 200,000
years since our species began, we’ve had

28
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:15,230
agriculture for just 5% of that time. We’ve had
electricity for .07% of that time.

29
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,310
The simple truth about climate change is that
it isn’t new to the planet, but civilization

30
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,940
is.
Andd here's what's even newer: In the past hundred

31
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:30,310
years, the number of people alive has quadrupled.
And thus so has the capacity for suffering

32
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,980
So slowing climate change isn’t about saving
the planet. It’s about us, about our vulnerability

33
00:02:35,980 --> 00:00:00,000
to a level of climate disruption that human
civilization has simply never seen before.
