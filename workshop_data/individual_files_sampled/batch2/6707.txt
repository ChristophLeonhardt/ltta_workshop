so you may not know this but the UK is going through an intense heatwave right now with many opting to wear clothing that would keep them more cool and breezy but what do you do if you're a schoolboy and you're at a school that has a no shorts rule well the answer is of course bollocks to that let's wear skirts let's take a look so boys at this school the iske Academy and Exeter England they have a strict code that bans male students from wearing shorts even on day so hot wearing long pants it just seems impossible so these boys are protesting by wearing skirts often times borrowed from sisters and friends which is technically in the dress code where borrowed from I mean they all everybody's sister has the exact same skirt yeah it's a uniform uniform I know baby yeah good stay yeah I mean they all have a sister at the school at the same time you know that wasn't that mad internet search the night before this happen those guys their parents Boston those guys let's not get ourselves they didn't all borrow the exact same skirt so their parents were like yeah right do this right that's right boys at the school said they appreciated the nice breeze and they found it quite refreshing but the principal in the school that's the greatest reach forever I like my professional says student started fresh The Guardian yeah you don't want to get sued for nobody gets sued for plagiarism and we got to attribute we're not the ones saying it was quite refreshing Naggar do I wear skirts I find them refreshing sure you can quote me on that the principal of the school Amy Mitchell said shorts are not currently part of our uniform for boys and I would not want to make any changes without consulting both students and their families however with hotter weather becoming more normal I would be happy to consider a change for the future uh looks like the protests the boys put on finally a climate change story I can relate to uh yeah uh so yeah I mean the guy what what they were other were they were underneath though looks like that make sure like a bike shorts because yes that's a great thing yeah wear shorts except sure maybe wear a skirt over them yeah yeah and get some matching Mary Janes yeah the White Sox in the Mary Jane's is a terrible work well I mean looking at this I think a lot of dress codes are stupid for other reasons too I mean a lot of the times when we're looking at these in America uh we're seeing dress codes that are basically saying girls you can't be showing you know parts of your arm or your shoulders because it's too distracting for the boys ostensively which is it's it's silly it's it's we're teaching kids silly things by imposing this so I have two boys uh I just or quickly I hadn't thought of that part you make a really good point but I'm for uh a dress code I even support really a uniforms because I think they take away the economic disparities again oftentimes find themselves in school like so-and-so's wearing give all she and somebody else has got a YSL purse and once you take it all away everybody sort of has the same outfit I think that that helps things in that regard anyway pretty egalitarian or at least appearing so or in takes the onus away from you know thinking that looks are what matters most and you can focus on maybe other things you should be older before you realize that looks or all that matters uh the UH uh I like a school uniform too if the school feels the need for it I don't have any problem with that I do obviously have a problem if the if there if it becomes draconian and incredibly sexist you know you got a you right you get the boys wear shorts right right let the brightest to silly or dress if they want to you want to talk to families to just let the boy out it's too hot would no law about it just let the guys wear the shorts yeah I mean it was uh what you were in 2070 I think it was the winter it was the summer of 2000 uh fifteen uh when Jake uh uniformly by the way uh not to be funny uh allowed that uh that we didn't have to wear pants during the show was that ever a role you know we also on our time I went to wear yeah I throw all that hard yeah it's very hot here it Sun seasonably warm no outlook these are that this is funny amusing and and but you know I have a daughter and I uh and she says things like you know boys don't wear dresses and you know took twenty years ago I would have said that's right you know and now you like well most boys who you will see do not wear dresses but some boys wear dresses of a boy wants to wear a dress he should wear dress and she'll say so some boys wear dresses and I go that's right and you think well for everything still around no the world is still spinning we're not in there were in no more danger it's okay everything's fine there is also such a thing as kilts also you know kind of around the area as well yeah originated in that part of the world what do you get for young turks membership it's a mystery only one way to find out
