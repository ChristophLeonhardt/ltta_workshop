1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
It was supposed to be
the mass shooting that

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,850
finally galvanized
the country

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,090
and forced lawmakers
into action:

4
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,300
17 people dead after a
massacre inside a high school.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,520
Emotional calls for gun reform.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,800
"I want to feel safe at school."

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,000
Then, in came the N.R.A.,
with a slick campaign

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,310
and access to the
Oval Office,

9
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,740
to grind momentum
almost to a halt.

10
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,310
So how did the N.R.A.
pull this off?

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,720
The president needs
N.R.A. endorsement

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,780
to rally his support base,
especially in an election year.

13
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,360
Because of that,
the N.R.A managed

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,030
to secure meetings
with Trump in the

15
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,560
immediate aftermath of
the Parkland school shooting,

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,027
when calls for reform
were the loudest.

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,020
The N.R.A. has catchy,
succinct slogans

18
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,350
that are easy to remember
and drive their point across.

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,370
"To stop a bad guy with a gun,

20
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,300
it takes a good guy with a gun."

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,480
After Parkland, the N.R.A.
spokesperson went head to head

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,130
with student victims on TV.

23
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,769
"Well, I think the A.T.F. is
deciding about bump stocks

24
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,270
right now. The president ordered
the D.O.J. to look into it."

25
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,820
"I’m asking your opinion as a
representative of the N.R.A."

26
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,551
"That's what the N.R.A.'s position
has been. The N.R.A. came —

27
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:14,422
"What's yours?"

28
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:15,234
"I'm talking for them.

29
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:16,650
These are the 5 million members

30
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,600
that I’m here representing."

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,055
And on the group’s own channel 
they broadcasted stuff like this:

32
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:22,680
"These kids ought to
be marching against

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,990
their own hypocritical
belief structures.

34
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,630
They hate machines that
cause death except, hold on,

35
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,680
no, you ain't never going
to take their cars away.

36
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,550
They hate the idea
that guns save lives,

37
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,520
except the only reason
we’ve ever heard of them

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,480
is because guns didn't
come soon enough."

39
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,350
The N.R.A. aggressively
mobilized a membership drive

40
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,790
a few weeks after Parkland.

41
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,920
"Now is the time for all of us

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,550
to join together in defense
of the principles that

43
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,880
make America the
greatest nation on earth."

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,140
They claim to have over
5 million members.

45
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,210
But that figure has not been
confirmed by any outside party.

46
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,680
After Parkland, Florida
lawmakers passed

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,390
the first significant
gun control bill

48
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,170
in more than 20 years:

49
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,600
raising the age limit to buy
rifles from 18 to 21.

50
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,800
The N.R.A. promptly filed suit.

51
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,670
The calls for gun reform after
the Parkland shooting haven’t

52
00:02:14,670 --> 00:00:00,000
stopped, and neither have the
N.R.A.'s efforts to thwart them.
