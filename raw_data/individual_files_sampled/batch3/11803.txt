while the u.s. tries to keep down Iran's nuclear industry the Pentagon has been busy working on a major revamp of its own atomic weapons the plans were due for release next month but have been leaked to the media the Nuclear Posture review outlines extensive plans to upgrade and replace some of the outdated nuclear arsenal and develop more new warheads for submarines it also wants funding doubled over the next decade and the document lists Russia China and North Korea as threats which need to be countered the federation of american scientists say the u.s. already has well over a thousand low yields nuclear warheads and they are as powerful as the bombs dropped on japan in the second world war the proposed expansion is in contrast to president Trump's earlier pledge to seek global denuclearization number one I would like to denote the world I would like Russia and the United States and China and Pakistan and many other countries that have nuclear weapons get rid of them I stated America's intention to pursue the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons but I put forward a comprehensive agenda to pursue it to stop the spread of these weapons to secure vulnerable nuclear materials from terrorists and reduce nuclear arsenals well Robert Naiman from the just foreign policy campaign group told us that the plans would mean a cash windfall for Pentagon contractors it's a troubling development that they would put this out but the administration doesn't get to do this by themselves Congress will have to approve it and hopefully there will be pushback okay what is obviously an outrageous and foolish idea the United States already has more than enough nuclear weapons the idea building more is robbery of other priorities pentagon contractors are gonna make money off of producing nuclear weapons so that creates parochial interests that are pushing these things that are not it's something that's not in the interest of the world it's the interest of the majority of people in the United States
