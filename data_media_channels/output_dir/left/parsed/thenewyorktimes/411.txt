My understanding of America is
a land and a country where,
maybe above
anything else,
there is an understanding
and a recognition
of what each and every one of its
members, of its citizens,
can bring to the building
of a greater country.
Candidates please, 
and I know we practiced this,
please raise your right 
hand and repeat after me:
I hereby declare
on oath that I absolutely 
and entirely,
renounce and abjure
all allegiance and fidelity
to any foreign prince,
potentate, state or
sovereignty,
of whom or which
I have here to for been
a subject or citizen.
That I will support and defend
the Constitution and laws
of United States of America.
And that I take this 
obligation freely
without any mental reservation,
or purpose of evasion,
so help me God.
It's a huge moment for me,
being a citizen and citizenship
to me is just fully embracing
and fully contributing to this,
to this country that I will now call mine.
