1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,770
“I don’t know how
I start a play.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,290
I probably start it
with the first sentence.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,510
I know it’s not going
to be there for very long,

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,230
but I have to get — opening
the door a little bit,

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,710
sticking my head in,
and seeing what’s in there.”

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,240
Neil Simon was one
of the most popular,

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,430
and perhaps the most
prolific, playwright

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,010
in the history of
American theater.

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,590
He redefined
comedy, using humor

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,550
not simply to entertain,
but to tell soulful stories

11
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,736
about the frictions of
urban life and family intimacy.

12
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:41,610
“What are you doing?”

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,335
“What?”

14
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:43,490
“You know the doctor
said you’re not supposed

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,330
to smoke cigars anymore.”

16
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:44,940
“Who’s smoking?

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,610
Am I smoking it?

18
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,210
Do you see smoke
coming from the cigar?”

19
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,724
“But you got it
in your mouth.”

20
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:49,390
“I’m rehearsing.

21
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,305
I’ll do the show later.”

22
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:54,170
The New York Times sat
down with Simon in 2008

23
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,025
to talk about his
work and his life.

24
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:58,610
“I started actually
in the Bronx.

25
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,140
1927, July 4, and
always thought

26
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,485
from then on that they were
celebrating my birthday.”

27
00:01:06,485 --> 00:01:08,450
Simon grew up in nearby
Washington Heights,

28
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,970
an enclave for working class
Jews before the war.

29
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,340
But his home life
was terrible,

30
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,200
with a father who
was rarely around

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,495
and a mother who struggled
to make ends meet.

32
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:20,180
“Well, my father and
mother broke up so often

33
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,360
that after a while,
it was no news to me.

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,250
We would have to take in
boarders to help feed us.

35
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,330
They sat at the table.

36
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,790
My mother made
dinner for them.

37
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,700
It was really tough
for me, because I said,

38
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,930
my father should be here.

39
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,830
Not these men.

40
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,880
They weren’t un-nice, but it
was a very difficult thing

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,755
to grow up with.”

42
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:45,230
Simon’s way out was through
his older brother Danny,

43
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,160
a budding comedy writer
who got him started

44
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,980
on his future career.

45
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,050
Together, they landed
a job writing gags

46
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,700
for the 1950s television
legend, comedian Sid Caesar.

47
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,960
“What is your name?”

48
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,130
“John Baxter.”

49
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,640
“John Baxter, you’re fired!”

50
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,360
In Caesar’s famous
writing room,

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,600
the young Neil Simon found
himself among a who’s who

52
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,190
of the future of funny.

53
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,000
Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner,
Larry Gelbart, Mel Tolkin

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,430
and a very young Woody Allen.

55
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,795
For Simon, it was an inspiring
but tough cast of characters.

56
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:21,130
“My problem was the shyness.

57
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,304
I could think of
the line, but I

58
00:02:23,304 --> 00:02:25,470
wasn’t going to say like
Mel Brooks would, ‘I got it.

59
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,130
I got it.’

60
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,390
That’s what he would do.

61
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,540
I would have to sit next to
Carl Reiner and whisper it.

62
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,120
And Carl would jump up
and he says, ‘Neil has it.

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,050
Neil has it.’

64
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,090
He says, ‘The man walks
in and ba-dum bum bum.’

65
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,410
Whatever it was.

66
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,510
And they liked it.”

67
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,520
“Get someone up
here right away.

68
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:39,804
Because I need them.

69
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:39,950
That’s fine.

70
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,280
I know they are.

71
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,739
You tell them.

72
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:41,238
Who are you?

73
00:02:41,238 --> 00:02:43,287
What are —

74
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:44,411
what are you talking about?

75
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:44,870
Let me say what I —

76
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,078
I told everybody that’s fine.

77
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:46,696
Fine!

78
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:47,530
All right, talk to each other.

79
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,390
That’s right!”

80
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,170
Like many in the
writers room,

81
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,680
Simon aspired to do more
than write jokes,

82
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,680
but he saw firsthand how even
Caesar’s most-seasoned writers

83
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,055
had a tough time
breaking into theater.

84
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:01,040
“Mel Tolkin, who was
the head writer, said,

85
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,950
‘I got a play. I wrote it
with Lucille Kallen’ —

86
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,990
who was another
writer on the show.

87
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,760
It closed in one night.

88
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,730
And so I say, why
would I have the gall

89
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,650
to write a play when these
two really seasoned people

90
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,850
can’t get it on?

91
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,519
So I said, I better
write about what I know.”

92
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,050
Writing what he knew
would lead Simon

93
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,390
to help invent
a whole new genre:

94
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,970
the comedy of urban neuroses.

95
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,100
His big breakthrough play
and screenplay

96
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,200
was based on Simon’s
life as a newlywed

97
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,980
with his wife, Joan Baim.

98
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,750
“It was about getting married
and living together

99
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,430
for the first time without
knowing how to do that.

100
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,970
And what it’s like when
your husband and wife have

101
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,710
their first fight.

102
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,540
And it’s trauma.

103
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,640
It’s just trauma.”

104
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,560
“You’re hysterical!”

105
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,320
“I am not hysterical!

106
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,300
I know exactly what
I’m saying, Paul.

107
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,550
It’s all over between us,
and it’s never gonna

108
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,635
be any good anymore.”

109
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:58,680
“And ‘Barefoot in the Park’
became an easy play for me

110
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,350
to write, because it
was a loving play.

111
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,180
It was about me and Joan.

112
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,240
She was beautiful.

113
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,390
She was absolutely beautiful.”

114
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,180
Simon Says he met Joan at a
softball game in the Poconos,

115
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,270
and it was love
at first pitch.

116
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,850
“I’m batting, and there
she is pitching at me.

117
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,160
So I said, I really have
to get a hold of one

118
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,490
and show her.

119
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,600
So I swung — swung,
swang, swing —

120
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,340
at her, and hit the
ball as hard as I could,

121
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,730
which dribbled slowly to her.

122
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,740
And she picked up
the ball with a smile,

123
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,680
and she just waited for
me to get to first base.

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,930
And I’m saying, ‘Throw it.

125
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,410
Throw it will you please?’

126
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,270
And she threw it,
and she beat me out.”

127
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,560
“Officer.

128
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,835
We just got married.”

129
00:04:39,835 --> 00:04:43,810
“We married after that
first summer that we met.

130
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,450
All the things were real.

131
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,700
There was a staircase
that took you up

132
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,080
to the top floor
of the building,

133
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,350
and where the man who spoke
a foreign language lived.

134
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,430
He was on the
make for Joan,

135
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,050
who had nothing
to do with him.”

136
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,420
“Will you help me up, please?”

137
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,525
“Oh, with the greatest
of physical pleasure.”

138
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:05,290
“And we were walking one
night with our dog, Chips,

139
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,690
in the park and it was
a warm summer night.

140
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,660
And she took off her shoes,
and she was barefoot.

141
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,180
And we were walking, and
she said, ‘Why aren’t you

142
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,320
taking off your shoes?

143
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,280
Mine are?’

144
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,092
And I said,
‘I don’t feel like it.’

145
00:05:18,092 --> 00:05:20,050
She said, ‘No, there’s
something wrong with you.

146
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,811
You’re afraid to walk
barefoot in the park.’”

147
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:25,860
“Paul, you’re crazy.“

148
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,750
“And then, bingo.

149
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,307
You know, play title.”

150
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:32,180
Inspiration for Simon’s next
play also came from a source

151
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,350
close to home:

152
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,217
his brother Danny, who’d
recently divorced his wife

153
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:37,550
and moved in
with a friend

154
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,790
named Roy Gerber
to save money.

155
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,497
“Roy Gerber started having
big fights with Danny,

156
00:05:42,497 --> 00:05:44,330
and I just kept watching it
and watching it.

157
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,840
I said, ‘You know, Danny
there’s a play in this.

158
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
And he said, ‘Where?

159
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,090
What’s the play?’

160
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,210
I said, ‘These two guys
having more trouble

161
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,500
with themselves than they
would with their wives.

162
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,080
Same problems.

163
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,070
I said, one of you is
the wife, one of you

164
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,992
is the husband.’”

165
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,700
But nailing the script
for “The Odd Couple”

166
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,130
took a lot of trial and error,
as Simon and

167
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,470
director Mike Nichols discovered.

168
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,330
“There was a scene I wrote
that in the rehearsal,

169
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,460
they laughed so hard
Mike said we’d never

170
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,560
be able to put this on,
because the audiences will

171
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,880
die from laughter.

172
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,090
So we got to that scene.

173
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,310
There wasn’t a
single laugh in it.

174
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,890
And I said, ‘What
happened. Mike?’

175
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,674
He said, ‘It’s funny, but they
don’t like what’s happening.

176
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:23,090
They like these people,
and you’re

177
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,840
making them go in a way that
is not really good for them.’

178
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,900
So I changed that, and we got
less laughs but more cheers

179
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,490
for the play.

180
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,990
So I started to
learn about it.

181
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,230
That it’s not all
about the laughter.

182
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,027
It’s about the feelings
that the audience gets.

183
00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:42,110
Do they like these people?

184
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,190
Do they don’t?

185
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,340
Are they living their lives
well, or are they not?”

186
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,520
“The Odd Couple” opened
on Broadway in 1965

187
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,250
and became Simon’s
most successful work.

188
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,610
The play spawned a movie
starring Walter Matthau

189
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,560
as the sportswriting
slob Oscar Madison, and

190
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,364
Jack Lemmon as
neat-freak Felix Unger.

191
00:07:00,364 --> 00:07:01,280
“It’s all over, Felix.

192
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,910
The whole marriage.

193
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,162
We’re getting an annulment.

194
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:04,171
Don’t you understand?

195
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:05,795
I don’t want to live
with you anymore.”

196
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:09,320
The movie, of course, led
to a popular 1970s TV series

197
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,570
with Jack Klugman
and Tony Randall.

198
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,820
Simon had signed away
the rights for the TV series

199
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,220
to Paramount, a decision
he came to regret.

200
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,080
But by this time,
he was already perhaps

201
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,020
Broadway’s biggest and
most bankable writer.

202
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,570
In 1966 alone,
he had four shows

203
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,700
running on Broadway
at the same time,

204
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,130
an unrivaled record.

205
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,620
But just as Simon was
topping the world of theater,

206
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,037
he and Joan got
devastating news.

207
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:34,370
“We got up early
in the morning,

208
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,890
went to the doctor’s office.

209
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,820
He examined her.

210
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,440
Then he came back in,
and he says, ‘It’s bad.’

211
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,680
‘What?’

212
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,560
‘She’s got cancer.’

213
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,700
And then I start to feel
myself rolling and rolling,

214
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,950
and you’re reaching out
to grab on to your life,

215
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,250
to be able to help her,
and you can’t.

216
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,360
You’re just rolling
and rolling.”

217
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,930
Joan died in 1973
at the age of 39.

218
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,030
They had been married
for 19 years.

219
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,850
Her death sent Neil reeling
and he immediately

220
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,150
sought someone to fill the
void, marrying four times,

221
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,070
twice to the same woman.

222
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,470
“I mean, other wives
are the mistake

223
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,520
you made when you’re married
to someone for 19 years

224
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,730
that you hope you can be
married to for 60 years.

225
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,895
That whole period
is so dark for me.”

226
00:08:22,895 --> 00:08:25,160
After a number of plays
about his failed marriages,

227
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,290
Simon returned to writing
about his childhood struggles

228
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,346
in Jewish working-class
New York.

229
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:32,179
“What did I tell you
about banging the ball?

230
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,979
Your Aunt Blanche
has a headache."

231
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:34,820
“I can’t stop now.

232
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,860
It’s a crucial moment
in World Series history.

233
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,510
The Yanks are
playing the Giants.”

234
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,808
“Brighton Beach Memoirs”
was the first of Simon’s

235
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:42,530
semi-autobiographical trilogy

236
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,460
about a wisecracking teenager
named Eugene Jerome.

237
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,720
“It was about
growing up, idolizing

238
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,960
his older brother, who was
going to go off to the war.

239
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,170
And the kid didn’t want
him to go off to the war."

240
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,795
“You always told me
never to run away.”

241
00:08:55,795 --> 00:08:56,711
“I’m not running away.

242
00:08:56,711 --> 00:08:57,280
I’m leaving.

243
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,820
Only kids run away.”

244
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,680
“Biloxi Blues,”
part two of the trilogy,

245
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,260
was based on Simon’s
own stint in the Army,

246
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,485
and won him his first Tony
award for best play in 1985.

247
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:10,410
“That’s a mistake, Gene.

248
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,822
Once you start
compromising your thoughts,

249
00:09:12,822 --> 00:09:14,280
you’re a candidate
for mediocrity.”

250
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,488
One of the most memorable
scenes is based on the trip

251
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:19,410
to a brothel Simon made
as an eager, yet terrified,

252
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,460
young virgin.

253
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,466
“I was on that line
waiting to get in —

254
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:24,320
you know 15 guys
waiting to get in

255
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,210
to screw this one woman.

256
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,170
And you say, ‘You sure
you want to do this?’”

257
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,630
“O.K. honey.

258
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,775
Do your stuff.”

259
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:33,945
“What stuff is that?”

260
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:35,250
“And you do it.

261
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,000
And you come out —

262
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,100
all you think of is,
I’m a man.

263
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,150
I’ve done it.”

264
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,640
In “Broadway Bound,”
part three of the trilogy,

265
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,320
the mother gives
a fiery speech

266
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,544
that channels the turmoil
of Simon’s own mother.

267
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,460
“Is that how it works?

268
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,720
You have an affair,
and I’m left

269
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,303
with the choice of
forgetting about it

270
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:52,902
or living alone the
rest of my life?

271
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:55,605
Boy, it’s so simple
for you, isn’t it?”

272
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:58,740
“Writing that was
difficult and great,

273
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,600
because I was making
a character who

274
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,777
never really spoke open, but
she was not that articulate.

275
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:06,360
I mean, my mother
could never come out

276
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,665
with a soliloquy like
that and tear him apart.”

277
00:10:10,665 --> 00:10:12,420
But it was his play
“Lost in Yonkers”

278
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,030
that ultimately took Simon
from the realm of comedy

279
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,770
into serious, critically
acclaimed drama.

280
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,010
The play and the
feature film is the story

281
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,870
of two young boys
forced to live

282
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,130
with their domineering
grandmother and

283
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,150
mentally challenged aunt,
a scenario similar to what

284
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,096
Simon faced during his
own childhood exiles.

285
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,370
“You made it so clear.

286
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:37,224
You just didn’t want to
be touched with love.”

287
00:10:37,224 --> 00:10:38,640
“You don’t just
choose it and say,

288
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,980
‘I think I’ll do
a serious play.’

289
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,160
You know, you say,
‘I want it to be bigger

290
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,070
than what I’ve been writing.’

291
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,260
And I don’t need to have it
being funny all the time.

292
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,160
When you have the heartbeat
of the play there,

293
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,650
you can be funny over here
and you can be funny over here

294
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,365
as long as you don’t
touch the heartbeat.”

295
00:10:58,365 --> 00:10:59,700
“Lost in Yonkers”
would be Simon’s

296
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,740
last major Broadway hit.

297
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,310
It earned him
the Pulitzer Prize.

298
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,935
“Maybe everybody else
here, but not me.

299
00:11:04,935 --> 00:11:05,940
You understand?”

300
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,680
“I never think about
getting better so

301
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,750
that I will be a
better playwright so

302
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,750
that I will win
a Pulitzer Prize,

303
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,100
so that I will do this —

304
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,060
never think about that.

305
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,310
You just think,
get the play there.

306
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,810
Maybe it’ll have a life.

307
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,270
Maybe you’ve done something
good for other people.

308
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,670
Hopefully you’ve done
something for yourself,

309
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,400
the actors, whatever.

310
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,590
It’s just, you want to
get the writing out.

311
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:31,230
You want to get the
things that you think

312
00:11:31,230 --> 00:00:00,000
about life onto the stage.”
