00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:10,110
I had a grade school teacher
tell me once:

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,446
"Whatever you do, 
do with your might.

3
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:17,484
Things done by halves are
never done right."

4
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:21,087
And I pretty much live by that.

5
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,495
I always wanted to be a cowboy.

6
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:32,499
And I decided I'm going
to build a Western town.

7
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:42,208
It's not an easy job
running a place like this.

8
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,711
You don't have much time for
yourself.

9
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:48,648
I don't work 24 hours a day,
but for an old man,

10
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:52,752
I put in a good
day's work.

11
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:15,842
Once you start something
like this and you see it grow

12
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:19,479
and you see the people that
come back year after year,

13
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,082
I think we're just trying
to preserve 

14
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,318
the memories of this,
you know.

15
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,463
Probably our biggest thought is
we don't want to sell this 

16
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:41,000
to anybody that's just going 
to come in here 

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,169
and sell everything off.

18
00:01:43,169 --> 00:00:00,000
But, you can't stop anything.
But, I'lll still be here.
