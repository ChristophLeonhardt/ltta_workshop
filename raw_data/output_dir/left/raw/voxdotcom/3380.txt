00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:07,509
When someone accuses a police officer of misconduct,
it's often a he said-she said situation. But

2
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:12,660
video is completely changing that. Ever since
a bystander recorded Rodney King being beaten

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,210
by Los Angeles police in 1991, the power has
been in the hands of witnesses, especially

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,420
now that so many people have camera phones.
But it's up to chance whether a bystander

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:28,039
captures an interaction on video or not. Most
police departments now have in-vehicle dashboard

6
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,229
cameras, but they vary in how they're used.
Now, there's a rapid rise in the number of

7
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:36,780
police departments who are testing body cameras,
so that all interactions can be recorded,

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,319
not just the ones that take place right in
front of a police car. In some cases, video

9
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:46,389
evidence can be the key that demonstrates
that a police officer really did commit a

10
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:51,280
crime. "Can I see your license please?" 

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,440
"Get
out of the car! Get out of the car!" [shots fired].

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,620
 "Get on the ground! Get on the ground!"
"I just got my license. You said get my license!"

13
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:07,450
When police officers aren't conviced, or even
charged, after an episode of misconduct, video

14
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,299
can show how wide the gulf is between what
many people feel is acceptable and what cops are

15
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,659
allowed to do, such as the killiing of John
Crawford for carrying a toy rifle in 
a Walmart. 

16
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,460
[shots fired] 

17
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:42,240
But bodycams and dashcams are also helpful to police. In fact, video evidence exonerates cops more often

18
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:47,039
than it convicts them. And some cities have
found that just using cameras puts everyone

19
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:51,259
on their best behavior. One town in California
found that use-of-force incidents dropped

20
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:56,770
60% after police started using body cameras.
The next big question is control of video

21
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,549
footage: When cameras get activated, how footage
gets stored, and who's allowed to edit a video

22
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:07,340
before it gets released. In several cases,
body cameras or dashcams have "malfunctioned"

23
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,160
or gone dark at critical moments, raising
concerns that the footage is being manipulated.

24
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,810
Imagine how that might have affected something
like a recent New Jersey case, where the jury

25
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,670
might have heard this: 

26
00:02:37,820 --> 00:00:00,000
Instead of seeing this:
