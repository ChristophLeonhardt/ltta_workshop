THERE IS A SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHIC
THAT GETS TO ENJOY THEIR UP
SESSION WITH GUNS WITHOUT ANY
TYPE OF CRITICISM, SO.
LET'S MOVE ON TO AN INCREDIBLY
IMPORTANT STORY THAT I
REALLY WANT TO SHINE SOME LIGHT
ON.
*****************************************************************************************
THE ACLU RECENTLY DID AN
INVESTIGATION INTO THE NUMBER OF
AMERICANS WHO ACTUALLY GET SENT
TO JAIL BECAUSE THEY ARE POOR.
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO
UNFORTUNATELY HAVE BEEN DEALING
WITH FINANCIAL EMERGENCY, MAYBE
A MEDICAL EMERGENCY AND AS A
RESULT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PAY
CERTAIN DEBTS AND SO COLLECTORS
HAVE FOUND A SNEAKY WAY TO
CIRCUMVENT THE LAWS AGAINST
DEBTORS PRISONS IN ORDER TO FIND
A WAY TO IMPRISON THESE PEOPLE
UNTIL THEY PAY BACK THAT MONEY.
LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS ON
THIS AND THE INTERCEPT DID
AN EXCELLENT JOB IN REPORTING
IT.
SO WHAT THEY DO IS THE
COLLECTORS WILL TAKE THESE
DEBTORS TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT
AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, THE
JUDGE WILL RULE IN THE
COLLECTORS FAVOR MEANING THAT
THE PERSON WHO OWES THE DEBT
WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE
RULING INDICATING THAT THEY HAVE
TO PAY THAT MONEY BACK BUT
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU ARE POOR?
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE
TO PAY THAT MONEY BACK?
OFTENTIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY
WILL NOT GET THE NOTIFICATION
NECESSARY TO SHOW UP TO ONE OF
THE COURT HEARINGS AND WHEN THAT
HAPPENS, THERE IS A WARRANT OUT
FOR THEIR ARREST AND THEY
ARE THROWN INTO JAIL.
USUALLY THE JUDGE WILL DECIDE TO
SET THE CASH BAIL AMOUNT AT
THE SAME AMOUNT THAT THAT
INDIVIDUAL OWES TO THE
COLLECTOR AND THEN AS SOON AS
THE PERSON, IF THEY ARE
ABLE TO PAY THAT BAIL AMOUNT
PAYS IT, THE JUDGE THEN
HANDS THE MONEY OVER TO THE
COLLECTION AGENCY.
SO WE OUTLAWED DEBTORS
PRISONS IN AMERICA IN 1833, SO
ALMOST 200 YEARS AGO WE THOUGHT
IT WAS SUCH A BARBARIC
PRACTICE THAT WE SAID YOU ARE
NOT ALLOWED TO DO IT ANYMORE.
NOW WE HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK INTO
DIFFERENT WAYS.
NUMBER ONE, IF YOU OH THE
GOVERNMENT MONEY, SO FOR
EXAMPLE FOR A TRAFFIC TICKET
THEY GO WELL, THAT'S DIFFERENT.
YOU ARE NOT OWING IT TO A
PRIVATE CITIZEN, TO
GOVERNMENTS OF YOU DON'T PAY
THAT WE CAN PUT YOU IN PRESENT.
NOW THERE ARE SO MANY FINES AND
PANEL SEASON LEVIES BECAUSE IT
IS A REGRESSIVE FORM OF
TAXATION, THEY CUT TAXES ON THE
CORPORATIONS AND THE RICH, THEY
HAVE TO GET IT FROM SOMEWHERE SO
THEY INCREASE PARKING METER
VIOLATIONS AND STUFF BUT
YOU ARE THAT THE GOVERNMENT A 39
JAIL.
THE SECOND WAY THEY HAVE DONE IS
WHAT IS BEING OUTLINED HERE
AND IT IS A REALLY INTERESTING
LOOPHOLE THAT THEY CREATED.
IF YOU OWE MONEY TO, LET'S MAKE
UP AN ABSURD CASE.
MCDONALDS, IT'S A PRIVATE
CORPORATION, THEY CAN'T PUT YOU
IN
PRISON BECAUSE HE DID NOT PAY
FOR YOUR BIG MAC BUT WHAT THEY
CAN DO AND SO ONE OF THESE CASES
IS ACTUALLY JARED KUSHNER'S
FAMILY THAT OWNS THE APARTMENT
BUILDING AND THEY ARE DOING
THIS TO ABOUT 100 PEOPLE WHO ARE
LATE ON THEIR RENT.
OKAY, THEY DO NOT PAY THEIR
RENT, YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO
KICK
THEM OUT, ETC.
WE ARE NOT ARGUING ABOUT THAT.
THEY SAY YOU OWE ME MONEY SO I
CANNOT PUT YOU IN PRISON FOR
THAT, I'M HAVING TROUBLE
COLLECTING IT SO INSTEAD I AM
GOING TO START A CIVIL
PROCEEDING AGAINST YOU, NOT
CRIMINAL BUT IF YOU DO NOT SHOW
UP AND THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENS
MOST IN MEDICAL EMERGENCIES
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT STILL BE
IN THE HOSPITAL OR YOU MIGHT BE
IN A DIFFERENT STATE BEING
TREATED AND THEY GO, AND A LOT
OF TIMES THEY DO NOT WANT YOU TO
SHOW UP SO THEY MAIL IT TO YOU
RIGHT AWAY, COUPLE OF NOTICES.
YOU DO NOT SHOW THE COURT THEN
THEY GO, HEY, MISTER JUDGE,
CAN YOU GIVE ME A WARRANT FOR
THEIR ARREST BECAUSE THEY
DID NOT SHOW UP TO COURT.
THAT IS CALLED CONTEMPT OF
COURT.
THE JUDGES ARE IN ON IT
UNFORTUNATELY.
THAT IS WHY THEY DO WHAT
ANNA SAID, YOU OH $2300
AND THEY SAID THE BAIL AT WINK
$2300 AND AS SOON AS YOU
GIVE THE BELL MONEY THEY GIVE IT
OVER TO THE COMPANY.
IF YOU HAD THE $2300 ADDITIONAL
WRONG BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE
DEBTORS PRISONS BUT MOST OF THE
PEOPLE HERE DO NOT HAVE THE
MONEY, THAT IS WHEN THEY DID NOT
PAY IT OR SOME OF THEM DON'T
EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT AND THEY
CANNOT FOR THE BAIL SO IF
YOU ARE RICH, NO PROBLEM.
YOU CAN AFFORD THE BILL, YOU'RE
DONE.
MIDDLE-CLASS, MOST OF YOUR
ALBRIGHT.
IF YOU ARE POOR, THAT IS IT,
YOU ARE ROTTING AWAY IN A
DEBTORS PRISON.
AND IF YOU ARE POOR YOU DON'T
HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO
DEFEND YOURSELF SO FOR INSTANCE
IF YOU ARE NOT PROPERLY NOTIFIED
BY THE COURTS OR THE COLLECTION
AGENCY THAT IS GOING AFTER
YOU HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FIGHT
BACK?
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE YOUR
CASE THAT YOU DID NOT GET
THE PROPER NOTIFICATION.
IF YOU ARE POOR YOU DON'T HAVE
THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT,
THAT REQUIRES A LAWYER AND A
VERY EXPENSIVE LEGAL
PROCESS SO I WANTED TO PROFILE A
COUPLE OF THE STORIES THAT
REALLY STOOD OUT TO ME.
THESE ARE SPECIFIC PEOPLE WHO
WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS
AND WHAT I'M ABOUT TO READ
SPEAKS TO WHAT YOU WERE SAYING.
PEOPLE WHO HAD MEDICAL
EMERGENCIES AND WHILE THEY
WERE GETTING THE TREATMENT THAT
THEY NEEDED, THE NOTICES
WERE SENT AND THEN AS SOON AS
THEY COME HOME, THEY ARE
SERVED WITH WARRANTS AND A
HAVE TO GO TO JAIL.
LET'S GO TO GRAPHIC 43.
SO SHE RETURNS HOME AND SHE IS
LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON?
AND THEY'RE LIKE YOU HAVEN'T
PAID YOUR MEDICAL BILLS, THERE
ARE THREE WARRENTS FOR YOUR
ARREST.
DOESN'T
MATTER THAT SHE WAS SUFFERING
FROM SICKNESS AND
SHE WAS GETTING THE TREATMENT
THAT SHE NEEDED, THEY DIDN'T
CARE.
AND SHE DIDN'T BREAK ANY
LAWS.
EXACTLY.
NEXT CASE:
YOU CANNOT GARNISH GOVERNMENT
BENEFITS LIKE SOCIAL
SECURITY, SO THE COLLECTORS AND
THEY COME FOR YOU, THEY TAKE THE
SOCIAL SECURITY MONEY YOU MIGHT
NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN YOURSELF.
THAT IS WITHOUT LOGS IT BUT NOW,
SINCE THEY CAN ARREST YOU,
THEY USE THAT THREAT OF ARREST
TO GET YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY
MONEY ANYWAY AND IN THAT CASE,
IT IS A PERSON WHO IS
PARTICULARLY NOT ABLE TO
PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEY
INTIMIDATE AND THREATEN, ETC.
THERE IS AN ATTORNEY IN TEXAS
WHO RUNS A COLLECTIONS 101
COURSE AND IN THAT COURSE, HE
TEACHES IN A HANDBOOK ENTITLED,
IT'S EASIER TO SETTLE WHEN THE
DEBTOR IS UNDER ARREST.
THIS IS NOTHING THERE UNAWARE
OF.
THEY KNOW WHEN THEY USE IT TO
THEIR ADVANTAGE.
THE COURT SYSTEM KNOWS IT BUT IT
HELPS THEM CRUSH POOR PEOPLE
ANYWAY AND JENNIFER TURNER FROM
THE ACLU MADE A GREAT POINT
SIMILAR TO WHAT ANA WAS SAYING.
SHE SAYS IT IS LARGELY AN
INVISIBLE PROBLEM BECAUSE
THE PEOPLE IT AFFECTS DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY FOR LAWYERS.
THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR
PR.
OF COURSE NOT SO NOBODY EVER
FINDS OUT ABOUT IT AND THAT
IS WHY THEY PICK ON THE
POWERLESS, BECAUSE IT IS EASIER.
THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY MEANS TO
FIGHT BACK SO IN SOME WAYS, THAT
WE'VE OUTLINES AND OTHER
STORIES, THE RICH GET RICHER AND
IN THIS CASE, THE POOR GET
POORER AND BY THAT IF YOU PUT
THEM IN JAIL, THEN THEY
OFTENTIMES GET FIRED AND THEN
THEY HAVE LESS MONEY AND KIDS
PIGGYBACK AND THEN THEY
HAVE TO SIT IN JAIL LONGER.
NOT ONLY DO THEY GET POORER BUT
THE POWERLESS GET EVEN MORE
CRUSHED BY THE SYSTEM.
AND IT'S REALLY A SYSTEM OF
SKIMMING PEOPLE AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE BECAUSE EVERYONE, ALL
THE BAD ACTORS HERE ARE IN BED
TOGETHER AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT
IS NOT ONLY DO THEY THREATEN
THESE PEOPLE BY SAYING THERE
COULD BE A WARRANT OUT FOR
YOUR ARREST, THEY ENCOURAGE
THEM TO TAKE OUT LOANS FROM
PAYDAY LENDERS SO IT IS A
VICIOUS CYCLE.
WE ALL KNOW THAT AS SOON AS YOU
TAKE OUT THAT LOAN FROM
PAYDAY LENDERS THERE ALL SORTS
OF FEES AND HIGH INTEREST
RATES ATTACHED TO THAT LOAN AND
IT ESSENTIALLY DIGS THESE
PEOPLE INTO AN EVEN DEEPER
FINANCIAL HOLE AND IT IS
REALLY DEVASTATING TO SEE HOW
MANY PEOPLE SUFFER FROM THIS.
BY THE WAY, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES
ACCORDING TO THE ACLU DEAL WITH
THESE ARREST WARRANTS EVERY
SINGLE YEAR AND THE PROBLEM WILL
ONLY GET WORSE IF WE ALLOW
OUR POLITICIANS TO BE BOUGHT
BY THE SAME COLLECTIONS
AGENCIES AND PAYDAY LOAN LENDERS
THAT LOVE THE SYSTEM, SO
MICK MULVANEY, WHO WAS SUPPOSED
TO PROTECT US AS CONSUMERS
IS REFUSING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT
THIS.
HE HAS ALREADY SCRAPPED A PLAN
TOGETHER ADDITIONAL DATA ON
CONSUMER UNDERSTANDING OF DEBT
COLLECTION DISCLOSURES AND ALSO
KEEP IN
MIND THAT THESE INDUSTRIES ARE
DEEP 
IN HIS POCKET.
I WANT TO ADD ONE BIT OF CLARITY
TO THAT.
MULVANEY GOT MOVED OVER TO THE
CONSUMER FINANCIAL BUREAU.
THE TIME THEY WERE PLANNING TO
DO A CAMPAIGN TO PROTECT
YOU GUYS.
IT IS IN THEIR NAME.
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION
BUREAU SO THEY KNEW ABOUT
THIS PROBLEM AND IT WAS
ACTUALLY A RARE CASE FOR THE
GOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO DO
SOMETHING POSITIVE.
MULVANEY, HAVING ALREADY TAKEN
MONEY FROM THE PEOPLE WHOSE JOB
IT IS TO COLLECT MONEY FROM YOU
AND PUT YOU IN PRISON SAID
OH, WHAT AN UNLUCKY BREAK FOR
YOU GUYS.
IT TURNS OUT I DECIDED YOU DO
NOT NEED PROTECTION.
I ALREADY GOT MY $3000.
THAT IS ALL IT TAKES.
THE MINUTE HE COMES IN
AND GOES NO, WE ARE NOT GOING
TO DO THAT PROTECTION ANYMORE.
KEEP ON PUTTING THEM IN
PRISON AND SQUEEZING THEM
FOR EVERY DOLLAR AND EVENTUALLY
GIVE ME A TINY LITTLE BIT OF
IT AND THAT IS ALL YOU NEED.
THE SICKNESS OF MONEY IN
POLITICS IS WHAT DRIVES SO
MUCH OF THIS.
WE ARE IN SUCH BAD SHAPE WE ARE
HOPING TO GO BACK TO THE
GOOD OLD DAYS OF 1833.
