China is playing a more important role in the world today than the United States that's what's come from a recent poll conducted by the washington-based think tank the Pew Research Center it also shows that the Chinese leaders is more trusted globally than his American counterpart what gets Donald Trump obsessive his image sure but what else China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election I've done a lot of business with China China's market distortions China China China China Sea China and he has good reason to be fixated the rise of China is showing no signs of stopping with the nation poised to overtake America as the next world superpower polls conducted across 25 countries show widespread recognition that China is the emerging power with the might to more than rival Uncle Sam good china overtake the US as the main search on has got a good chance of doing that they're way above everybody else people underestimate them any action may well be on the most powerful country now is certainly the United States but I think China will definitely surpass it in the future but here's the thing China may well become the most powerful in economic terms but people are not so keen on Beijing taking the reigns as the globe's moral compass and think the u.s. is still the best option as the world's voice of reason it's scary I lean more towards the USA for their democratic system and human rights so I don't think it would be better if China became more powerful however ranking leaders on doing the right thing and Trump is well down the list lower than China's Xi Jinping Oh oh yes sure fake news but that's not to say that Trump doesn't have those who hang on his every word he's huge in the Philippines it seems most people there love nothing more than an outspoken not to mention provocative man in control and you don't even have to be able to hold a tune Billy has Murali the owners of the commander in chief of the United States and in Israel forget about it Trump is the man pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem has earned him furious brownie points and alienated a whole bunch of people too we have I would say probably the best relationships right now with Israel that we ever had I think we was close now is maybe ever before with the tert a and Netanyahu on his side Trump has his support but with China's Renaissance coupled with America's decline does Trump really have what it takes to remain at the top of the world pedestal how likely do you think you he is to succeed so I want to take one Trump I don't think it's possible Aubry 3-0 it scared been maybe between one and five his influence around three come on man let's be honest Donald Trump is Trump you
