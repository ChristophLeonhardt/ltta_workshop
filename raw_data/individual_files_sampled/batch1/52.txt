whose life was so brutally taken Scheherazade Gafoor al-jazeera as you just saw there Indians have been incensed by the murder of a sefer many people are using the hashtags justice Recife and my street my protests demand accountability and action let me give you a little sample of some of the tweets and the online commentary that's been going on had a merchant says we need a safer India for women we need justice for all rape victims speak up every voice counts Mathari criticizes the time it took for this case to receive attention wondering how many children girls and women must be brutally killed before we act and not react and sub Jan notes that the sister is not much older than a sefer and that she fears for her safety here's a video that she took of a recent justice for a sefer protest prime man Prime Minister Modi and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party or BJP promised to combat gender-based violence with an initiative called safe the girl child educate the girl child the police report of what happened to a sefer has a lot of people asking questions joining us a New Delhi to help us discuss them fire Naqvi is a writer as well as a women's and minority rights activist burqa dart is a journalist and contributor to The Washington Post and RJ Gautam is a founder of Hama Hindu a Hindu rights and welfare organization guess it is good to have you here on the stream burka when you first heard this story your initial reaction was what well what that of any human being or the heart would be this was a child she'd gone to take her ponies you know to the forest pond near her village she belonged to a nomadic community she was out grazing her cattle she disappeared and never made it home we now know from the police charge sheet itself that she was abducted she was forcibly sedated she was waved gang-raped not once but repeatedly and then she was killed and her head was hit twice with a stone to make sure that she was dead how can any humans heart not break to hear that and then after the heartbreak in the anger Femi because I saw my country's national flag being used by a self-appointed Hindu group my flag that I'm extremely proud of as an Indian my flag represents the Constitution the Constitution represents justice and yet the men accused of rape were being defended using the Indian tricolour and I felt both rage and shame and I think those are three emotions of millions of Indians today it started with heartbreak it was followed by anger and it was followed by a sense of shame as to how and why this had been allowed to happen Farah I want to show you this comment from Deepa Narayan she's an author have a listen to what she said she joined one of the protests I participated in the protest demonstrations in Parliament Street against the rapes in who now and katoa there were older men women children five-year-olds who'd held up a sign saying am i next there was outrage as well as despair at the cracks in democracy the fact that they were police there were lawyers there were politicians involved in both cases and an outcry from citizens determined not to be silent anymore fara I'm just wondering it makes sense I understand why all Indians will go out to protest the murder of a young girl who was so brutally raped and then and then killed I don't quite understand how there could be protesters protesting against potential people who were being arrested and protesting that they should be released can you explain the context of how that might happen in India well the context of this is very it's a very long story if you want to get into the real historical context why this would happen but the simple fact is that this girl happened to be a Muslim Muslims are increasingly under attack in India as all of us know from 2014 onwards there has been an increasing number of brutal public lynchings these are videotaped these are then circulated these are seen as acts of valour and nationalism has become equated with the Hindu eyes nationalism with the Hindutva nationalism which is that these are seen as as acts that the demand the national flag for example one lynching victim when his attacker subsequently died of natural causes his body was the attackers body was draped in a national flag in one case in Rajasthan Safran flag which is the symbol of the Hindu / BJP party was hoisted atop the court so you are seeing uses of a national symbol increasingly in India to hear the the advent of a very human dominated quality and a Hindu dominated democracy in which minorities are not safe the fact that this girl was a Muslim is not who in Siddhant oh and while as a feminist and as a women's rights activist i have stood on the street and fought for the rights of all sexual violence sexual assault survivors and there is no dearth of them when communal hate and religious bigotry combined with misogyny it is a lethal mix and that is what happened to this this innocent child you know I just heard barkhaa and I am sadly still in a place of heartbreak I am I am very much in that place of heartbreak because it's going to take a while for India to come to terms with what has happened to this eight year old baby but I am also optimistic an activist must be optimistic I believe that the signs of angry people even if they are only you know a majority are on social media and I am unfortunately not but I still see a potential breaking and a bridging of these terrible fault lines in India along religious divides because Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Christians and everybody who makes this country great has come together and said no more to the brutalization of this little Muslim girl who was routinized because Muslim but also because she belongs to a very disempowered pastoralist community so they are easy targets they you know there is no political party that is standing up for them as fast realists and so that is another dimension of this tragedy she was disempowered of the disempowered she was a member of a tribal pastoral community called the Bakr Valles there are many such tribal communities and in Jammu and Kashmir both the dominant communities happen to be Muslim and this was a three you know what what chills your blood is the fact that this was planned carefully it was not a crime of opportunity this was carefully planned to scare the living daylights out of these pastoralists so that would lead cut wah and and never return so this was a Landgraf you know you know vacate evicting people para let me just start with for the purpose of our audience this is not your opinion that you're stating here about this being a planned murder this was from the police report there's a lot of details that berker be mentions that you far I've been mentioned because actually in the police report Rd I know you want to come in as you come in let me just share this with you from your prime minister so that the audience knows what is the Prime Minister of India thinking about what's going on right now he said recently the instance in the past two days are an embarrassment to the civilized society we bow our head before the founding figures of the nation no culprit will be spared justice will be delivered they've been so credit some so much criticism about the Prime Minister about how long he took to say something I'll take Gautam what do you want to add the fair trial and fear investigation is a fundamental right as well as that said say human right now this is the first time in the history when the accused person are demanding he dared up CB Central Bureau investigation may investigate this matter and the narco test also done with the accused person because in all always all time only victim and with him families are demanding CBI probe and narco test but this is the first time when the accused are demanding now this is a well-planned conspiracy to malign the image of the India because India is a very progressive country and this is what if you go through the charge which they appear there three words they continuously repeated in their charge sheet they said a minor Muslim girl they said the accused are belong to the Hindu community and they said the Hindu temple used for the crime now now I am asking a very simple question in the month of January the crime has taken place and after the one week of the incident a 15-year Muslim boy caught by the Jammu and Kashmir Police which was released after the 15 days of the arrest and this statement has made by the by the hon durable minister of the Jammu and Kashmir government before the assembly and what happened suddenly after the release of that void after the two months they have they have been arrested eight Hindu boys with understand what our Jang is bringing out Thank You Beth so I think that there is this absolutely needless defensiveness and insecurity about India's image abroad there is a separate time and race to have a conversation about whether the Western media whether the non-indian media stereotypes the India story or only tells the stories of India in terms of communal tension or sexual violence and I would be the first to get up and say yes there there is a stereotyping of my country but that's not what we're here to talk about we're here to talk about it eight-year-old child and I think what should embarrass us as a nation is the fact that our lawmakers are politicial then it isn't just the BJP I interviewed the lawyer who first represented this little child who's from the same community the same village Tali who said and he told me that he had witnessed local politicians from every party the BJP the Congress the National Conference the pantless party name any party in that region basically supporting the self-appointed Hindu group which was called in the wake the Munch translated into English that stand or Hindu unity front when this young lawyer as you know raised a very good question he said this was not to protect Hindus this is to protect rapists this is in fact an insult to Hinduism and in there you can see that tweet coming up white this is this is this is that lawyer and he's telling me why not a Hindu Muslim make the Munch in other words why not a front for hindu-muslim unity when you name a front the Hindu unity front in the aftermath of the rape of an eight-year-old child you want sending Hinduism you are defending alleged accused rapist and it is this that embarrasses India abroad not highlighting it let me just bring us out the attack he took me one moment yes far as there is the lawyer representing her family is his is a Hindu Deepika raja baath is a Hindu woman who is being written by these ultra-nationalist in the wounds and saying how dare you take up this case she has sought and been given thankfully protection by the Honorable Supreme Court of India because she feared for her own security this is these this is a Hindu lawyer and a Muslim lawyer standing up to defend the right of a young of an eight year old who was decimated and and you know I undersold they are they are defending the very soul of this country so so I to try and and and do this you know the accused were Hindus and they are wrongly accused I was actually hoping that mr. Gautham was here to say how absolutely heartbroken he is that a temple was defiled in this horrible manner and that his gods had to walk I'd say for whole time frame him let's let's here and wear the RJ Curtin has that remorse well it is upset at all and I I will absolutely let me just say for the benefit of our audience this little girl was kept in a temple and she was drugged and multiple raped and then she was killed in a Hindu temple which is what Farah was referring to mr. Gautam go ahead the temple cannot be used for act for the crime scene and this is the chargesheet only the I heard all of your patients leave so allow me for make my company did you read that did you read the autopsy report of or did you review do you go with the report on this report have you really have you read have you read fully said just filed a chargesheet with eighteen fifties there is an autopsy report yet there is an autopsy report filed by the Jammu Kashmir police before the Honorable court my symbol submission my simple submission is that you do you not want the real culprit way may arrest and they should be behind the bar and I see forget that justice why you are making this to do Hindu and Muslim I am talking to you I see forget the justice and the real culprit may be erect and there should be behind the bar very why the ascites special investigating team has been the officer of the acai teeth chain tries not one not two different I want to bring in some evacuates as well I hear you and I hear the debate going backwards and forwards far out hold tight for a moment let me just bring in some of these comments from our online community and I'd imagine he says India is sadly one of the only countries that allows rapists to roam freely and we just bring in another one here Aparna the act of rape is a dastardly offence that section of our society is supporting the accused is horrific and then let me actually go to the mother and father of a sefer because let's bring it back to the personal tragedy that is really going on here and see what they have to say about why their daughter was murdered have a look bicycle Darbar TT hub suited batiti she was a very beautiful and clever girl she was pretty why was she killed for what reason everyone knows the details about the case now and even God knows these perpetrators must be asked why they killed such an innocent soul and it must be investigated okay I'm just us not far not a GG nor I none of us are investigators right we are not the detectives who investigated this case all we can do at this point is quote from a very comprehensive 18-page police charge sheet that is now evidence in in the judiciary it's with the courts of India what upsets me in this case beyond the brutalization of this child and her murder of course is that whoever is guilty I have never seen nationalism and Hinduism being used as a cloak to defend men accused of rape if mr. Gautham is right and indeed these men accused of rape are innocent the court will decide that and the court will determine that why does that mean that while they are accused of rape the tricolor of this country what kind of nationalists are these I think either pseudo in those and pseudo nationalists and in fact are the enemies of Hinduism and I hesitate to make this a Hindu Muslim issue because millions of people who have risen for this child and do note I'm not naming her because the law of this country does not allow us to identify this child but millions of Indians who have risen for this little girl are of all faiths and the majority of them are Hindu and all I want to school RJ Gotham is if these men are it is said what will decide that he can't I can't but that doesn't mean anyone should be marching on the streets for them preventing the police from actually going to court to file the burqa let's let our J just finish his thought Adi may I ask who's this and just get this to you charmeuse Avila says I look at our p.m. with high morals I have full faith in him he's an individual who wants not only India to develop but looks the welfare the whole world at large this is somebody who has confidence in your Prime Minister how confident are you that these parents of this little girl and actually all of the families of women and children who have suffered for sexual violence in India that they are going to get justice how confident are you are you asking mr. Gordo ah I am optimistic all Tamizh please thinking very deeply about that question mr. Gautam how confident are you that the parents of Asifa will get some justice justice for a sefa I'm a very much trending with the justice for Asifa and I am demanding that's why neither me and the rest of the local people are demanding the CBI probe because the under which manner jumbo and fully Jammu and Kashmir Police are investigating it's a vast Manor and they are the pre do dish and they all they are implicated by innocent people in this matter due to their political or any other pressure which I cannot disclose on this tale and thereby I just remand if see a cent CBI may investigate this matter the narco tests will be done too with the all officers who are investigating this matter and the all accruals which they are demanding kid narco tests in the CBI probe so that the truth will come before the nature and before the international community because up due to this to this case the image of India is very badly and everybody thank you yes yes I want to get in here my problem with mr. bottoms position is quite simply that you are not allowing the law to take its course you are trying to interrupt it you are trying to obstruct it you are trying to it is unprecedented that the Bar Association of of Jammu and that lawyers who are sworn to uphold officers of the court are preventing the police from filing a charge sheet in that court they have been wrapped on the knuckles there was a protest today in Delhi let me let me let me end up with some suggestions I don't have my - fighting backwards and falling for debate bring the volume down for me one minute in the control and thank you very much let me just share this with you this is from Mohammed Amit and he says I am so sorry for the death of a sefa this is live on YouTube right now I am strongly suggest that the Indian government must bring the murder before the court and the government should give compensation to a cephas family as here the guest once again this is the price of silence sometimes we have that on this show sometimes we don't we have to stop having the same conversation again and again espousing justice as a retroactive eulogy upon girls and women who should be breathing I think that pretty much sums up what we've been doing for the last half an hour burka at the end of the show let me just ask workers to say something in one minute in less than one minute and if we've got time we go back to you if not we do that online go ahead but we've got 30 seconds okay I just want to say that I think Indians are tired of living from outrage to outrage yes it's annoying I can see what mr. Gautam is saying that we don't like a stereotypical Outsiders gaze of our country but that's you know that's a secondary debate right now the primary debate is how do we institutionalize a system where responses to rape sexual violence indeed to those who live on the margins of society like this poor little girl and her nomadic community sabaha Institute for anak fear mr. Rodrigo tan thank you so much for bringing some of the passion and the debate that's happening in India right here on to the stream thanks for watching everybody see you next time you
