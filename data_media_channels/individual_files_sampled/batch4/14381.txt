I see with my own eyes a mighty industrial site right off of an Hoover it is a coal export terminal that is so huge it's just it's it's as big as like a major dam or something it's it's a special marine terminal just for coal not with the other marine terminals for every other species of import and export and I also hang out a little bit in Whistler BC and every half hour every hour a mighty train rolls through this beautiful little tour's town of White Rock and it has only one thing on it coal and it's warren buffett's trains i always note that my seller is warren buffett and it's bringing coal from america to export through canada but there was something i did not know about that mighty marine criminal and these mighty trains and the cool they're in until I read Loren Gunter's column in the Edmonton sudden he joins us now to talk about it well in thanks for being here could I read your headline now I want you to dig into it trade war reveals environmental hypocrisy I know those trains well and then it's fun to show kids trains and I always fly around and I know about the coal but I didn't know the fact you divined about them tell us about well anybody who's ridden the ferry that goes out of sawsan to Vancouver Island knows it knows that terminal because it's just north of where that you board that you drive your car on the ferry the next place north is this enormous coal Harbor a coal port that used to be called Roberts Bank they now call it West Shore Terminal and what happens there is it's the largest coal terminal on the west coast Canada or the United States its enormous it ships more than 30 metric tons 30 million metric tons a year of coal mostly destined for China and what I didn't realize till I started digging around is that almost a third of that coal so about 11 million met tons a year comes from mostly wyoming and montana it's american coal a third of the kohler goes out of West Shore is American coal it comes from Wyoming in Montana for the most part and it ships through the Port of Vancouver making Vancouver the largest export terminal for American coal on the west coast it beats out any American terminal there is more American coal one-third the entire American export of coal goes out of Vancouver and not a single lump of it is subject to the carbon tax well that is the amazing part it I mean I'm against carbon tax I know you're against the carbon tax too but I think the point here the incredible point here is Alberta is not allowed to export its oil but America is allowed to export its coal which is even more carbon intensive and God bless it I'm a program guy but you don't hear a beep from Catherine McKenna or John Horgan or Justin Trudeau about carbon taxing that coal import and export not a peep that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
