1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,843
HOWIE: MELANIA TRUMP WAS JUST

2
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:15,714
STARTING TO GET JOURNALISTIC

3
00:00:15,714 --> 00:00:17,916
PRAISE FOR HER TRIP TO THE

4
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:23,421
BORDER WHEN THE MEDIA WENT

5
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:24,756
HAYWIRE OVER HER JACKET.

6
00:00:24,756 --> 00:00:28,159
>> IT'S A SORT OF JACKET YOU

7
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:30,161
WOULD WEAR AS A TEENAGER.

8
00:00:30,161 --> 00:00:34,833
>> SHE IS WEARING A $39 JACKET.

9
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,469
THE LEAST EXPENSIVE GARMENT SHE

10
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,038
HAS EVER BEEN SEEN WEARING.

11
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:46,678
HOWIE: AMIDST THE ENDLESS MEDIA

12
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:48,113
COVERAGE.

13
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:50,715
DESPITE HER SPOKESWOMAN SAYING

14
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:53,485
THE MEDIA SHOULDN'T OBSESS ON

15
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:54,152
THE JACKET.

16
00:00:54,152 --> 00:00:58,189
IT SEEMS TO ME SHE WAS SENDING A

17
00:00:58,189 --> 00:00:58,523
MESSAGE.

18
00:00:58,523 --> 00:01:00,091
>> I THINK SHE WAS.

19
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:02,894
BUT I DIDN'T GET IT.

20
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:05,497
TO ME THE JACKET WAS A TOTAL

21
00:01:05,497 --> 00:01:06,831
HEAD A SCRATCHER.

22
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:10,969
IT WAS A BIT OF MY OFFICE

23
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:12,937
COLLEAGUE WOULD CALL AN UNFORCED

24
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:13,371
ERROR.

25
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:15,974
SHE IS THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE

26
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:20,445
TRUMP INNER CIRCLE TO TRAVEL TO

27
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:24,382
THIS AREA IN TEXAS TO VISIT

28
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:25,517
THESE SHELTERS.

29
00:01:25,517 --> 00:01:27,519
I WISH SHE WOULD HAVE LET THAT

30
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,789
STAND ON ITS OWN.

31
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:38,129
HOWIE: I THINK THE MARIE

32
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:40,498
ANTOINETTE COMPARISON IS UNFAIR.

33
00:01:40,498 --> 00:01:42,333
APPARENTLY NOBODY ON HER STAFF

34
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,402
WARNED HER THIS MIGHT DISTRACT

35
00:01:44,402 --> 00:01:48,006
FROM HER MESSAGE?

36
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:50,041
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY THE ONLY THING

37
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:54,379
WE DO SNOW IS SHE CARES ABOUT

38
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:56,648
THE CHILDREN BECAUSE SHE WENT TO

39
00:01:56,648 --> 00:01:58,216
VISIT THE CHILDREN.

40
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:00,618
THIS IS A MONTH SHE HAS HAD, A

41
00:02:00,618 --> 00:02:02,520
WEEK SHE HAS HAD WHERE HER

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,222
FAMILY HAS BEEN VICIOUSLY

43
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:04,789
ATTACKED.

44
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:07,192
SHE HAD A HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITY

45
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:09,928
CALL FOR THE KIDNAP AND RAPE OF

46
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:10,762
HER CHILD.

47
00:02:10,762 --> 00:02:13,698
SHE HAD MEDIA OUTLETS

48
00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:14,966
QUESTIONING HER SCHEDULE SHORTLY

49
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:16,501
AFTER SHE HAD SURGERY.

50
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:20,371
YOU SAW SOME OF THIS NEGATIVE

51
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:23,274
TREATMENT DURING THE OBAMA

52
00:02:23,274 --> 00:02:24,109
ADMINISTRATION USUALLY COMING

53
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:25,310
FROM THE FRINGES.

54
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,581
IN THIS CASE IT'S BEEN THE

55
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:32,450
MAINSTREAM TOP LEVEL SEASON

56
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:32,851
LIGHTS.

57
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:35,420
SHE MIGHT BE SENDING A MESSAGE

58
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,355
TO THOSE PEOPLE.

59
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:42,193
HOWIE: ONE OF THE REASONS I FEEL

60
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:44,162
COMFORTABLE SAYING SHE IS

61
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:46,431
SENDING SOME KIND OF MESSAGE.

62
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:50,635
WHEN SHE CAME BACK AND WALKED

63
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:52,003
INTO THE WHITE HOUSE SHE WAS

64
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:54,739
STILL WEARING THE JACKET AND IT

65
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:59,144
WAS 81 DEGREES.

66
00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:02,213
MAYBE MELANIA TRUMP IS REBELLING

67
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:05,950
OVER THE WHITE HOUSE HANDLING OF

68
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,519
THIS ISSUE.

69
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,089
RICHARD: THAT ANALYSIS IS

70
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:11,723
ENLIGHTENING.

71
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:13,825
I TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT MORE

72
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:15,627
THAN THE PRESIDENT'S TWEET.

73
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:17,896
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO

74
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:20,165
MAKE A NEWS STORY.

75
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:22,534
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT MELANIA SAID

76
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:25,436
ON THE BORDER, THOSE WORDS SPOKE

77
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:25,804
LOUDLY.

78
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:27,238
SHE SAID I'M TRYING TO DO

79
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:29,107
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO MAKE

80
00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:31,943
SURE WE REUNITE THESE FAMILY AS

81
00:03:31,943 --> 00:03:33,878
FAST AS POSSIBLE.

82
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:34,646
GILLIAN IS RIGHT.

83
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:36,915
SHE IS THE ONLY MEMBER OF THIS

84
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:38,716
FAMILY THAT WENT DOWN TO THE

85
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:39,083
BORDER.

86
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,853
SHE IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST

87
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:43,655
RANKING PEOPLE IN THIS

88
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:45,290
ADMINISTRATION.

89
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,192
SHE IMMIGRATED TO THIS COUNTRY

90
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:47,759
HERSELF.

91
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,596
THE FACT THAT WE ARE MAKING A

92
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:55,300
STORY ABOUT THIS JACKET SPEAKS

93
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,803
MORE ABOUT US AND LESS ABOUT

94
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:02,373
HER.

95
00:04:02,373 --> 00:00:00,000
THE JACKET DID MATCH THE SHOES.
