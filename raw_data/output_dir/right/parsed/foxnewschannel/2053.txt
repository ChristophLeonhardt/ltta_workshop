GOODNESS.
INVESTIGATORS WORKING TO
DETERMINE WHAT STARTED IT.
>> WE ALL KNOW IF YOU WRITE A
NEGATIVE STORY ABOUT FUSION GPS
YOU NEVER HEAR FROM GLENN
SIMPSON AGAIN.
REPORTERS SHOULD CONSIDER THEIR
SOURCES AND ALSO REPORT ON
THEIR SOURCES IF THEIR SOURCES,
FOR EXAMPLE, GLENN SIMPSON AND
DAN JONES ARE STILL WORKING
WITH RUSSIANS TO TRY TO CONFIRM
THE UNCONFIRMABLE.
>> Bill: THAT'S MICHAEL CAPUTO
ACCUSING THE MEDIA OF IGNORING
FACTS IN FAVOR OF STAYING ON
GLENN SIMPSON'S GOOD SIDE.
MICHAEL CAPUTO IS HERE TO
EXPLAIN THE CASE HE WAS MAKING
YESTERDAY.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
WHILE YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF
ALL THIS RIGHT NOW YOU MAKE A
CASE THAT REPORTERS WILL NOT
REPORT ON FUSION GPS BECAUSE IT
WILL COST THEM INFORMATION.
WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION,
MICHAEL?
>> WELL, DAN JONES, WHO USED TO
BE A SENATE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE INVESTIGATOR ON THE
DEMOCRAT SIDE LEFT CONGRESS AND
STARTED A COMPANY CALLED PENN
QUARTER GROUP.
THIS GROUP NOW ACCORDING TO HIS
TESTIMONY AS WE READ IN THE
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE REPORT, HE
HAS RAISED $50 MILLION FROM
ABOUT 10 DEMOCRATIC DONORS OUT
OF CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK
WHICH NARROWS IT DOWN SOME TO
CONTINUE COORDINATING
ADDITIONAL RESEARCH BY FUSION
GPS WITH CHRISTOPHER STEELE,
THE BRITISH SPY THAT THE
HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN HIRED,
AND ALSO BY THE WAY,
CHRISTOPHER STEELE GETS ALL OF
HIS INFORMATION FROM PRESENT
AND FORMER KGP OFFICER.
WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT WHO IS
BRIEFING THE INVESTIGATORS.
HIS FORMER BOSS, SENATOR
FEINSTEIN, IS THE DEMOCRATIC
LEADER OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE WHICH HAS TURNED
THEIR HEARINGS INTO ABSOLUTE
PERJURY TRAPS.
SO HE ALSO SAYS HE IS BRIEFING
THE F.B.I. WHICH HE TRIES TO
INTIMATE INCLUDES THE SPECIAL
COUNSEL.
>> Bill: WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO
EXPLAIN HOW THIS THING GOES
ROUND AND ROUND.
HOW ARE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
SUPPOSED TO UNDERSTAND THIS DO
YOU THINK, MICHAEL, BASED ON
YOUR EXPERIENCE?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I WORKED IN
CONGRESS FOR A WHILE AND THEN I
WORKED WITH THE MEDIA VERY
CLOSELY WHEN I RAN THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES RADIO AND
TELEVISION GALLERY.
IT TOOK ME A LITTLE WHILE TO
FIGURE OUT THIS LITTLE TWO STEP
THAT THEY DO.
BUT THE REPORTERS WORK VERY
CLOSELY WITH THE LEFT ON THE
HILL AND IN THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION, THESE GROUPS
ARE ORGANIZED AND FUNDED BY
HIGH DOLLAR DEMOCRATIC DONORS.
THE PROBLEM THAT REPORTERS HAVE
IS ONCE THEY GET ADDICTED TO
THE REGULAR BRIEFINGS THAT THEY
GET FROM FUSION GPS, IF THEY
WRITE A STORY HOW DAN JONES IS
NOW FUNDING FUSION GPS TO WORK
WITH SPIES FOR $50 MILLION.
NOBODY IS WRITING THAT EXCEPT
FOR THE FEDERALIST BECAUSE IF
YOU WRITE A BAD STORY ABOUT
GLENN SIMPSON IT'S LIKE
SOMEBODY CUT OFF YOUR DRUGS.
IF YOU WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN
THE CONTINUING RUSSIA COLLUSION
DELUSION, YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING
BAD TO OFFEND GLENN SIMPSON.
>> Bill: I HEARD YOUR STATEMENT
THAT REPORTERS ARE LEAVING
FACTS AND ETHICS BEHIND.
I WANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THEY'RE NOT REPORTING SO
THAT WE CAN GET A BETTER
EMBRACE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING
BEHIND THE SCENES.
ALL THE MOVEMENTS IN COURT AND
WHAT THE JUDGE SAID FRIDAY IS
INTERESTING.
IT ALL NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED
SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE
CONTEXT.
YOU, HOWEVER, HAVE BEEN IN THE
NEWS FOR A VERY DIFFERENT
REASON.
YOU WERE INTERVIEWED BY
MUELLER'S TEAM FOR THREE HOURS
AND YOU DID A SERIES OF
INTERVIEWS.
I SAW YOU ON EVERY NETWORK.
WHAT YOU LAID OUT, MICHAEL, IS
HOW YOUR FAMILY HAS BEEN
EXPOSED TO WHAT YOU SAY IS
FINANCIAL RUIN.
AND YOU MAKE THE CASE THAT YOU
AREN'T THE ONLY ONE.
NOW, SINCE YOU'VE GONE PUBLIC
HAVE YOU HAD ANY BLOWBACK FROM
THEM?
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM THE MUELLER
TEAM OR NOT?
>> NO, I HAVEN'T.
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT IN ANY
LEGAL PERIL.
I'M A WITNESS, NOT A TARGET OR
SUBJECT.
THEY KNOW THAT AND SAY THEY
WATCH ME -- THEY TOLD ME THEY
WATCH ME ON TV TO ME MEANS BE
CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY.
IF THEY BRING ME BACK IT IS
ONLY REALLY TO PUNISH ME WITH
MORE LEGAL FEES.
NOW THAT TRUMP SUPPORTERS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE GONE TO
MY GoFundMe PAGE AND BEEN
GENEROUS I'M NOT AFRAID OF THEM
ANYMORE.
THE WORST THING I'M JUST THE
ONLY PERSON OUT THERE TALKING
ABOUT THIS.
THERE ARE A DOZEN OR MORE
PEOPLE, MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES
WHOSE DAD OR MOM HAS BEEN
DRAGGED INTO THIS AND THEY ARE
RACKING UP LEGAL FEES AND THEY
ARE AFRAID TO TALK, TOO.
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW
THEY'LL PAY FOR IT AND THEY
THINK IF THEY TALK IN THE
MEDIA, THAT THEY ARE GOING TO
BE HAULED IN AGAIN AND PUNISHED
WITH MORE LEGAL FEES.
IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO BE
INVESTIGATED.
IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO BE
INDICTED OR GOING THE JAIL,
THEY'LL BREAK YOU FINANCIALLY.
IT'S ABOUT RUINING EVERY SINGLE
ONE OF US.
>> Bill: TO BE CLEAR YOU WERE
ON TV MAKING A POINT LAST WEEK
THAT IF YOU THINK RUSSIAN
COLLUSION, THE QUESTIONING OF
IT IS DEAD, YOU'RE WRONG
BECAUSE ALL THE QUESTIONS
DIRECTED AT YOU CENTERED ON
THAT, IS THAT CORRECT?
AND WERE THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT
THE PRESIDENT OR WERE THEY
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE?
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL I STILL
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE I
DON'T WANT TO BE -- GET MYSELF
IN A LEGAL JAM OF THEY MAY
ACCUSE ME OF OBSTRUCTION MYSELF.
THEY WOULDN'T BE ASKING ME
ABOUT OBSTRUCTION AND THE WHOLE
FLYNN AND COMEY THING.
THEY WOULDN'T BE ASKING ME
ABOUT FINANCIAL CRIMES WHICH
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH.
THEY WOULD BE FOCUSED ON ME
WITH RUSSIAN COLLUSION BECAUSE
I WAS THERE IN THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN TO NOVEMBER 15 TO JUNE
16 WHICH THEY THINK IT'S THE
WINDOW WHEN IT STARTED.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON
COLLUSION.
NONE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT.
NONE ABOUT ANYBODY WITH THE
LAST NAME TRUMP.
SOME PEOPLE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE
THE CAMPAIGN, OF COURSE, WERE
DISCUSSED.
I'LL TELL YOU, THEY DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING NEW.
WHAT THEY THOUGHT MIGHT BE NEW
IS NOT EVEN FACTUAL.
THERE IS NO RUSSIAN COLLUSION
ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
THERE NEVER WAS AND I DON'T
THINK THE MUELLER TEAM HAS
ANYTHING.
>> Bill: MICHAEL CAPUTO
REACTING AGAIN TODAY.
