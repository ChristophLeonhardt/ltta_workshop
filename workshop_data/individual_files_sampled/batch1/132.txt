back to China now about six years ago in 2012 we reported on what was an undercover defect of Chinese journalism the rise of investigative news outlets one of the organizations we looked at then was the nan Fong Media Group or Southern Media Group based in the city of Guangzhou publishing papers like the southern weekly the southern metropolis daily and the 21st Century Business Herald the group had a track record investing in deeply reported muckraking journalism that held Communist Party officials to account and even resulted in some political and legal reforms that's not the case now after a few serious run-ins with the authorities southern media and its journalists have come under a kind of pressure that is severely handicapped investigative reporting this is just one case in a landscape that has seen significant shifts greater state monitoring and control of media as well as increased competition and falling advertising revenues have all had an impact the listening-posts Meenakshi Ravi now on the decline of the southern media groups investigative reporting efforts and what that says about journalism in China today April 2003 this other metropolis daily a paper published by the Guangzhou based Southern Media Group ran a report entitled death of the detained Swansea gang the story was about a young labourer picked up by police for not carrying his ID 72 hours later he was dead the official explanation a heart attack the paper published the results of the autopsy that revealed the extensive beatings that had caused Swansea gangs death fast forward to May 2008 and the earthquake in China's Sichuan province reporters from the southern weekly another publication of the southern media group broke the story of 40 school construction that exponentially increased the number of dead these were stories with real impact and the kind of journalism the Chinese rarely got to see it was a charmed time for news reporters and consumers in the country the 1997 2000s was the Golden Age of journalism investigative journalism in China and the prime example of that golden age is this other media goo this particular media group has done really well in attracting wide readership attracting advertising revenues and becoming one of the prime examples of high-quality reporting that is also capable making money in China so for the far two main issues emerged alongside China's social development in the 1990s the first was police abuse of power often resulting in violence or wrongful convictions the second was government corruption southern media group especially southern Weekly had many outstanding journalists well-versed in the methods of Western investigative journalism their reports on these subjects became the benchmark for Chinese media workers at the time yoga Amanjit China's Golden Age of journalism was not to last as the country approached a political milestone the 2012 transition from chairman who Jintao to see Jinping the censors swung back into action and aggressively for the southern weekly New Year's Day 2013 marked an unprecedented moment in China's media history that year in its new year's editorial the paper called on the country's leaders to a here to the principal's in China's Constitution as it went to print however the editorial was pulled by state censors and replaced with a version in praise of the party and its newly anointed leader journalists said the weekly stage to walk out the first of its kind in communist China hundreds of ordinary citizens would later join the protests in solidarity against the censors funky Chong was in the newsroom that day the censors really stepped over the line so there's so we posted this whole situation on social media and got a lot of supporters there were a lot of protesters outside our headquarter in Guangzhou supporting us yellow chrysanthemum symbolizing the death of press freedom were laid outside the headquarters of the southern weekly newspaper in the city of Guangzhou for a media are covered this incident and they really showed that this newspaper because of the saw reputation during last more than 20 years it got a lot of supporters in the society both on social media and offline the propaganda department of the Communist Party wants to exercise tight control over the media that became very very clear once jumping to over and declared which direction he was taking China the sailfin group particularly with the politically incorrect New Year editorial will have been seen as essentially mounting a bitch of a challenge and that's simply completely not acceptable and therefore you will have to be made an example of so that nobody arrows would dare to even think about copying what you have done through 2013 and after the censorship of the southern media group was taken to another level reporters were harassed online content was ordered to be taken down and publishing licenses were revoked the end of 2015 marked a low point the senior editor and former chairman of multiple southern media group publication shann how was sentenced to four years in prison on what many observers said were trumped-up extortion charges Changfeng a deputy editor and news director at the southern media group was forced to leave China just before si Jinping's ascension to power he has watched from the outside as the state's grip on media has tightened ever since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 there have been certain boundaries the media are not able to cross these include certain political topics ethnic minority rights national sovereignty the military and religion the political pressure placed on the southern media group is part of a systematic process to control the media in doing so the party seeks to control every aspect including its management the publishing of reports and even whom journalists can interview pressure is not necessarily always placed on individuals but on the industry as a whole under this system no media group whether it's southern Media Group side Jing Poong PI or eastern Media Group can escape political pressure however it was never political pressure alone that pushed the southern media group into decline competition from online media resulted in plummeting ad revenues and stagnating media salaries many journalists left to work in business and tech startups across the country the southern media groups case isn't an isolated one it's just one of the most prominent Sun yat-sen University recently published a report showing that across the media landscape the number of investigative journalists has more than halved since 2011 for those who remain doing investigative work involves navigating both the editorial read lines set in place by Beijing and the changing media market social media in China is very popular Weibo and WeChat are very popular in China so and we've won which had you could open your own personal account and some independent journalists just published their investigation a independent journalist named the Hamza team she published a piece about a sexual harassment case at Sonia Zhang University in southern China in it it was hugely popular and influential and just a few days after the publication the university just fired that professor who was involved well you still have some very good news media's in China we do see news media reporting on major corruption cases for example in the last year the most senior case a peripheral member who was being reported was that option jung-tae now he could be reported because he was somebody that she Jinping wanted to make an example on and therefore journalists could report but still in fact and the fairly tight guidance from the propaganda department Chinese media landscape and the relationship between the media the state is written with many contradictions we're seeing lack of investigations in some areas but some investigations and others and things changing very fluid bases and very quickly that's why it's called the battlefield it's not all you know one over it's not completely controlled or figure it out given the sheer number of voices in China's vast journalistic sphere absolute government control has never been completely possible what is undeniable however is that under siege in ping the Chinese state's command of the media space has been consolidated and reinforced with dramatic repercussions for investigative work across the country
