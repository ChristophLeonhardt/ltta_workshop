hi I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser II part we're inside the North American Bitcoin conference in Miami the excitement is palpable electricity in the air startups are starting up yes max it's been a pretty wild ride here very fun it's getting bigger bigger every time we go to a Bitcoin conference it's more and more people at them I do want to note one thing that we've kind of overlooked in the past week of coverage is the fact that the Dow Jones went up a thousand points the fastest in history it hit 25,000 points and then it hit 26,000 points the fastest move the fastest 1,000 point move in the history of US stock market I think that's the fifth thousand points move since Trump became president so I think we see some of that inflation perhaps you might call it hyperinflation that Janet Yellen and other central bankers were hoping for well yeah you've got the wealth effect because you've got stock market bond market property market crypto market all hitting highs new to all-time highs is trading trillions of dollars in the well I walked into the entrance of the hotel here in Miami and there's just replete with lamb bones everywhere Lambos Rolls Royces Maseratis you know the trickle down of the crypto economy in the stock market the property market is you know having a boom time this is a sort of town where you could drive a Lamborghini into the hotel lobby it's pretty interesting so um one of the biggest stock on the stock market of course is Apple I think it was the first trillion-dollar company right getting pretty close okay very close and so they they've had a good time obviously in the past year is the stock markets have boomed but one thing I want to look at is what tax reform Trump's tax reform has done to their bottom line and what sort of benefit that's gonna bring perhaps to the US economy this is in this headline Apple says it will pay thirty eight billion dollars in foreign cash and create 20,000 US jobs Apple said last week that it would make a one-time payment of 38 billion dollars to repatriate some of its vast overseas cash holdings the company which has faced international criticism for its tax evasion policies also said it would spend 30 billion dollars in the u.s. over the next five years creating 20,000 new jobs so this is rolling off of the tax reform we've we've seen a lot of these sort of announcements of apples also giving a $2,500 bonus to most of their employees in the United States we saw Walmart announcing thousand dollar bonuses Southwest Airlines American Airlines so many corporations have been announced and big bonuses because of the tax cut say that a huge tax cut down to 21 percent the likes of Apple will go into it only ever paid one percent but we'll get into that in a bit right yeah so this is all about bringing those jobs back to America bringing the cash back to America Trump's just finished his first year in office and this is some of the campaign promises that he made and he's making good on those promises it's really hard to criticize Trump because he's doing stuff he said he would do this is obviously going to be a huge boom for jobs in the US I'm gonna start manufacturing in the u.s. uncredible would that be if we start seeing iPhones and iPads or some other equipment actually being manufactured not in China not in Asia but in the United States I don't know if they're actually gonna do that or not but they're clearly bringing a lot of jobs and they're gonna build a whole new Apple campus and I guess they're shopping for a city now where to put that new Apple campus so this will be a Chilean dollar company should yeah they haven't made specific announcements of what these 20,000 jobs will be it could all be at Apple stores for all we know selling more products in terms of their tax so apparently they're paying a 15 percent tax on repatriated profits it looks like they're going to repatriate if you look at 38 billion that's pretty much 15% of the 246 billion they have held overseas so it looks like they're bringing it all back by that those numbers the article goes on to that in June Trump told The Wall Street Journal that Apple's chief executive officer Tim Cook had promised to build three big big big plants in the US as part of a discussion about tax reform the company is the latest to announce a one-off payment as a result of recent changes to US tax law which allows companies to pay a levy of 15.5% on overseas cash holdings that are repatriated to the US you know I remember during the Reagan years that trickle-down economics that was introduced and there wasn't really a lot of trickle-down but here this is actually trickling down in real talk Trump announced a tax cut and boom 20,000 jobs from the biggest company in the world relocated to the US or created in the US that's the genuine job boom tied to a tax policy again you know this guy was a novice coming into office a year ago I said you know why given the ball Judy does all the professional politicians suck you know see what this guy can do so far he looks good well you know one thing I want to say is that since the financial crisis and then President Obama came in a lot of people about Occupy Wall Street stores were like you know bankers got bailed out and then they were collecting all these big bonuses they are the ones that actually are getting hit hard because of these the new tax reform because they had massive losses in the 2008 2009 financial crisis and they've been writing those off so some of these guys I think it like Citigroup just announced that 22 billion dollars that they're going to have to hit on their profits this year because of this new tax reform because they they were counting on writing off all their big losses during their scams from the last you know crisis so now they're gonna be hit hard so he's actually hitting them hard unlike what we've seen in previous administrations yep makes perfect sense you know the tax loss carryforwards are going to be you know ended so they've got a real genuine bottom line event happening to them and they're being penalized for making bad bets that led to the crash of 2008 my Barrack Obama applied zero zero accountability after the 2008 crisis a matter of fact is just a shower dem are free money and said Oh play try to do better next time guys so again Trump says policy is actually inflicting a little pain to where it belonged the banks so back to Apple you know the Panama papers had showed that Apple had set up a complex web of offshore companies to basically pay less than 1% tax rate and regarding that the article mentions that in 2013 a Senate committee accused Apple of using a highly questionable web of offshore vehicles to avoid paying taxes in the US Senator John McCain said his constituents were quote mad as hell to learn that the world's biggest company was paying tax rates that were sometimes lower than 1% I've never seen anything like this that's across the board all big industrial companies all being Dow companies sp5 their tax rates member General Electric we've been reported on this couple years ago in a 70,000 page tax return and at the end of the process they enter up with a tax credit they got money back from the government so any kind of tax reform like this that levels the playing field is going to be a boom to industry to jobs it's long overdue I would imagine there'll be another tax reform bill next year just simplify it bring it a flat tax before he's all over and done with Trump will bring in a 50 percent tax rate across the board which would be the best possible solution to the tax you know question in the u.s. yeah so I mean I think obviously taxes have gone down on corporations we already have a low tax on capital gains so capital is very low tax across the world labor is still taxed very highly I saw somebody talking about this on Twitter this morning about these tax rates and it is interesting to note that right now labor is so cheap tax interest rates capital is so low so there there should be some sort of mechanism whereby you know we should make labor cheaper we don't need to make capital any cheaper there's already so much of it that's why stock markets keep on going up a thousand points in 12 days so we don't need any cheaper we like a lower burden on capital at this point we need a bit of a lower burden on labor because labor you know that the top tax rate is still you know in the well into the 30% look for seven years we've been preaching to labor that the solutions offered by government are insufficient you must accumulate cryptocurrency we started preaching this when Bitcoin was three alt market was less than 50 million it's now 500 billion six hundred billion gotta sighs eight hundred billion the way to fight against a lethargic government if you want to build capital is via crypto we've been saying this for six years six and a half years and we've been absolutely right and I'm meeting people here at the Miami North American Miami Bitcoin conference you walk up to me say thank you for Kaiser report in 2013 2011 2012 you've made me an industry you've made me millions of dollars I'm fighting against the banks I'm fighting against governmental lethargy I do want to caution you know it is quite prices are much higher on all these crypto currencies and they were back in 2013 Bitcoin was down in the hundreds is how the government has slowed on their feet to move and for wages and the way to fight back is via crypto of course you have to enter it with your hand up but you have your own sovereignty don't rely on the government to provide sovereignty for you they provide sovereignty for corporations not labor that's the message we say for seven years you've been standing on you waiting for better prices waiting for better prices you're gonna wait for the rest of your life you'll never be a sovereign individual you know you yesterday in the last episode you interviewed Ari you of storm tokens so there are other ways to enter the crypto markets by the way you don't have to like take your savings take your cash and convert it to crypto and then you know suffer the anxiety of the ups and downs of the crypto market because it could be very volatile for a while so with like the likes of storm token there are loads of platforms now where you can start your earn some crypto that's where primarily all my early crypto was earned so it does I think make it a little bit less emotional I know for a fact that I feel more emotionally distraught over when I convert fiat to crypto and then prices go down the stuff I earned for my time exchanged my time my labour for that for the crypto stroke and his way to earn crypto also there's still mining opportunities on some of the alt coins you can still mine alt coins home mining and you can do that all there's so many videos and so many resources if you're not participating in crypto at this point it's because you want to be poor are you well okay I mean there are different ways of thinking of it not just poor but like not wealth poor but sort of sovereignty poor and freedom poor like you know we have to get a little bit outside of the whole you know crypto bro sort of notion of like we all have Lamborghinis and something near zero-percent and it's great for corporations and it's great for those politicians that are benefiting from that it's also great for those wanted to get into the crypto space because the cost of capital has never been cheaper and the cost of being in this space is never going to get any cheaper but anyway for this first half from the North American bacon conference here in Miami stay tuned for the second half lot more coming your way welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser here at the North American Bitcoin conference in Miami time now to turn to Marco Santori Marco welcome thank you very much well number of years now you're a veteran in this space you are you're a lawyer yeah would you believe it you're a lawyer is it there's there's a couple of us okay so now you've specialized in bitcoins and tokens and crypto for years you weren't the very first one of the very first people that you're a veteran in this space and now we're entering a new period called initial coin offerings and it's always been a challenge in this space there's always been a regulatory question mark from the very very beginning and so Marco tell us a little bit about what the challenges are now for icos as you see it yeah you know now the regulator is SEC right this is what everybody's talking about when token sales well before token sells it was just bitcoins right it was money services if things got really exotic it was like coin or ether and people were talking about a totally different area of the law anti-money laundering kyc now people are talking about securities laws commodity derivatives lost the things that you know people who have been in in financial services for years sort of secondhand to them it's it's a second second nature to them but for entrepreneurs and technologists this is brand-new so the issues are am i selling a security if I make some if I slip up and make some kind of misstatement or I'm not able to you know plan the entire path of this token sale am i engaging in securities fraud brand new questions that technologists really have an end to answer right now I mean it started my career on Wall Street and it's a highly regulated environment and you know that at the beginning of the crypto space of Bitcoin space the big question was is it a commodity is it a currency and no one ever figured that out definitively I think the regulators are kind of coming down and calling it more of a commodity I think the CFTC is looking at it more in those terms but now with this ICO space it clearly comes under the bailiwick of the SEC and so are these ICS ramping their legal talent and are they prepared for this or is it a mismatch and secondarily the the SEC seems like they are a bit accommodating somewhat that they're letting some of the growth happen organically is that what's your perception there if the SEC has been in this space longer than most people realize I remember back in 2013 sitting down with SEC before there were token sales before there were I cos just just talking through sitting down with with SEC talking through the basic issues of this is the blockchain this is how you can see what aut XO is this is the difference between a private key and a network address they've been in this space for a long time and client lis learning which is what regulators ought to do they haven't they haven't demolished the industry the chairman has actually come out and said look some of these things are just not security if they're things we're not going to regulate I made it very clear that if tyrion for example with the ERC 20 tokens has a really use case though the network on which a lot of these token sales were filmed let's talk how he test yeah how he test okay what is it why is it important mark oh it's the test for what tokens are securities it also happens to be the test for what plots of orange groves or securities and so it's this really odd fit right people say oh it's really a square peg in a round hole or maybe it's a testament to sound principles based regulation but the reality is this is a test from the 70s right it's a test from the 70s when someone tried to sell plots of land in an orange grove they're really not the plots themselves just the profit from the plots as you see said that's a security how he said no no no either orange groves sec won that argument and they came up with the test to the the Supreme Court has that's for the Howey test investment of money and a common enterprise with the expectation of profit primarily from the efforts of others and you take that test and you apply it to a token sale and they're all different right and there seems to be more variations than there Laos in the Howey test in other words there's so many hybrids if you will in the space and you're on the legal front is that part of what you're doing is they're trying to sort through a lot of the minutiae in the verge enough to come up like you know how does this fall absolutely absolutely it's a it's a facts and circumstances based test which is sort of a league way of saying it's a smell test I'll know it when I see it but at least you know it gives flexibility to regulators who need flexibility in the world of changing facts and it accommodates all of the weird stuff you see happening like well I won't name any particular sales but there's just this great variety we're in the midst of this like Cambrian blue blossoming of all these different token models models for raising money models for moving money around models for representing assets that are not money as tokens so that they can be traded as freely as you could trade a Bitcoin right and where do you see big color in all this because you know that's the granddaddy of it all and it's got the biggest market cap still and on the regulatory front there if different countries are taking different approaches some countries are trying to position themselves as the quote-unquote Switzerland a Bitcoin they want to be pro Bitcoin they want to try to bring that business in-house some countries are afraid of it some countries like Venezuela are trying to adopted a blockchain technology bringing their own crypto coin that should be petrol to circumvent sanctions on the sovereign front Marco the big picture of the sovereign front or DC trends there so look the people have talked a long time about how Bitcoin is unregulated the coin is not unregulated the protocol is unregulated just like email is unregulated but uses of Bitcoin uses of aetherium uses of crypto in general are regulated based on how they're used so at least here in the United States and what I expect to see over the next year 2 3 4 years is the exporting of those regulations around the world like the u.s. is frankly very good at doing developing sound principles based regulations and let's face it sometimes not sound but by and large you know reasonable regulations and joining the joining g20 groups joining the fad of the Financial Action Task Force making sure that those laws become harmonized so that if you're doing business in the US you can pretty much do business in the EU or its said to be the UK or some Asian countries in pretty much the same way ok so you fly in the highfalutin circles of this industry you know you're a very well respected legal talent if people come to you Marco when you see guy like Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan who was scoffing at Bitcoin now he's done a Maricopa and said I was wrong I regret having said those negative statements where are the banks today in the crypto space do they consider it a challenge are they trying to adapt it there they confused still where are they now the bank's couldn't care less I'm telling you the bank's could not care less and I confess in 2012 and 2013 there were there were some undercurrent some sort of social community undercurrent about how the banks were going to react they were gonna try to quash Bitcoin they were gonna try to get rid of it and make sure that it couldn't threaten them he turns out that banks really aren't all that threatened by Bitcoin they don't feel threatened that I think realistically they aren't actually threatened so when Jamie Dimon said look I think bitcoin is a fraud and then changed his mind later I applaud that I think you know somebody should change their mind based on new information they should change their opinions based on new informations but when he did say Bitcoin is a fraud I was quoted in the same ft article saying look that is the the conjecture the Bitcoin is is used for money laundering has been long disproven it is it's it's just not a meme that has really aged well yes Bitcoin can be used for money laundering yes Bitcoin is used for money laundering but every single government that has studied it has found the use of crypto for illegal activities to be relatively low right they have the graphs in plastic they study you know use money laundering what is used and they have various fiat currencies and they have various other you know commodities and took those ways into a hash prepaid cards credit cards a whole laundry list of things HMT and in in the UK the UK Treasury just released another study to confirm its study last year that crypto still ranks the lowest it is an emerging threat as regulators like to say yes it's something to be on people's radar but look I mean this is miss just demonstrably this is this is not a criminals yeah it's a non-starter in that front terms a percentage now when I was speaking earlier about Bitcoin is it a commodity is it currency I saw your eyebrows furrow as to think I read your mind and you're like wow this guy is off base here somehow let me ask you that debate about how does it fall in the category of it is it like some would call it a duck-billed platypus right it's the mammal that lays that rather foul old Arnor amphibian you know what how do you see that so here's your chance articulate how you see it in the pantheon of assets and digital assets hi I am so I'm so glad that I don't have to because because bitcoin is not a commodity crypto is not a commodity it's not a currency it's not property it's a protocol it is a language the computers used to talk to each other what they do with that language to the application of the protocol that is regulated based on application thank goodness for that because had it gone another way we would have had technology specific regulations like all cars must have at least four cylinders in order to be safe and sound on the road well we wouldn't have any Tesla's if that if that was a law would right so thankfully we don't have much technology specific regulation in the u.s. we have application based regulations so when crypto is used to represent an investment contract it's a security when it's used to represent a limited partnership interest it's a security when it's used to represent you know in index of an index of other currencies for example like a stable coin it's probably commodity derivative it depends on how you use it that's how it's regulated in the u.s. today what about this argument some put forward that crypto should be protected under free speech because it's software software is speech and therefore it cannot be outlawed because you cannot outlaw a free speech your thoughts I I love the argument I I will shout it from the rooftops and tell them flew in the face and mix metaphors yeah makes a metaphor but look realistically if it is speech it's probably commercial speech in commercial speeches has a much lower bar for regulations to pass so even if it is free speech of course we have limits on that all right put on your magic prognostication hat and crystal ball next year at this time our next two or three years what are the big trends that maybe are not on people's radar that you see developing I think everyone's talking about the SEC and they are a powerful agency and they carry a lot of weight and they're very important but they may be beat to this they may be beat to market so to speak by the private litigations there's a lot of private lawsuits out there where the first question in court is gonna have to determine are these things securities I got to figure out which a lot of securities laws are common laws and they're just common law fraud laws you see might not be the first person to come out and give this clarity it might happen in the in the world of the private law there's a couple of class-action suits out there there are well-known examples and so you're saying there that's where the law will be made I'm saying we may have a decision by a court before we have this sort of crystal clear guidance by SEC or a safe harbor by SEC the courts might speak first do you see an example coming up I know my spillover into a gray area because you have clients and me don't you can't you know you speak in an initial way I guess isn't woman good phrase for that where they are treading the line in a way that has got more so than it's always been this way Marco from the day one it's always been are we stepping over the line it's always been that way is that kind of consistent for the last six or seven years all right we entered a different period where maybe it's slightly different in some way what are your thoughts I don't think there are any new eras when it when it comes to pushing the envelope I think entrepreneurs will continue to push the envelope and sometimes that will be a very very closely tailored envelope all right Fran so that's what we're seeing today Marco centaury can I mention the name of your firm yeah by all cooley yeah look at that look at that cool business card it's all black white and red that's classic anyway thanks for coming on the Khans report thanks for having me all right well that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me max Kaiser and Stacy I wanna thank our guest Marco Santori of Cooley do you want to catch us on Twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye all
