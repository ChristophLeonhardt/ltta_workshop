like they have their child care plan and

hers is you know of course even more

173
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,759
elaborate than Trump spec Trump is

foster their children's development and

regulations that currently discourage

informal child care such as a mom

187
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,229
watching our own kids the fourth part is

188
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:05,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that really the big one adds incentives</font>

189
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,490
for employers I'm sorry the fourth part

190
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,199
adds incentive for employers to provide

191
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,110
child child care at the workplace and it

192
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,430
has the federal government is

193
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,410
essentially guaranteeing for the first

194
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,150
time six weeks of paid maternity leave

195
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,970
and I believe Hillary Clinton's plan is

196
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">12 weeks for everybody to leave I think</font>

197
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,530
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> baby your entire staff just</font>

198

disappears and takes care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this now</font>

199
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,360
the important thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

200
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">Trump has to do this he is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> polling very</font>

201
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,270
badly among women because he offends

202
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,070
them cheats on them and treats<font color="#E5E5E5"> them like</font>

203
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,780
garbage and somehow some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them don't</font>

204
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,520
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was always told that that's</font>

205
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,440
what they want it but that no no it

206
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,090
turns out they won't vote for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

207
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,430
do that and so he's under he's rolled

208
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,810
out this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is supposed to</font>

210
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,259
people also think I mean partly it's

211
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:55,880
because he's a Democrat he's a lifelong

212
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,530
Democrat and he's a liberal and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

213
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what he's a point and and Charles</font>

214
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">Krauthammer said it best on the panel</font>

215
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,449
yesterday this was his reaction to the

216
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,669
plan Trump himself as a man who brings

217
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:07,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">up the deficit and the debt all the time</font>

218
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,159
as a sign of our decline of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sign of</font>

219
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,199
having government out of control and

<font color="#E5E5E5">having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in competence in government look</font>

221
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:16,699
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this raises the question of how</font>

222
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:20,120
many Democratic parties does the country

223
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,210
need we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one and I thought</font>

224
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">during the primary season the argument</font>

225
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:27,440
for Trump was he was a guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> who would</font>

226
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,690
stand up to the Washington Republican

227
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,270
sold-out establishment that refused to

228
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,789
stand up to Barack Obama on higher

on executive actions

232
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,870
and therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> we needed an outsider a</font>

233

disruptor named Donald the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump who</font>

234
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,790
would not do this what he is proposing

is to out democrats the democrats this

236
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,460
is an enormous new entitlement it will

blow the debt<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when he says the</font>

that Trump is throwing in this Democrat

251
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,770

basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> principle of conservatism the</font>

276
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,380
basic problem conservatism has with all

277
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,540
these entitlement programs is not that

278
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,010
we are heartless it's not that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

279
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,140
care about working families and all this

280
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff it's that basically when you go to</font>

281
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,910
work every day and somebody gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a</font>

is time taken out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your life that you</font>

put into working that you get money in

return for for the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font>

287
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that is now you have transformed your</font>

288
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,320
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> into money you can now spend that</font>

money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> invest that money as you see</font>

290
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,059
fit that is the very nature of your free

291
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,859
you know freedom actually has a lot less

292
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:58,809
to do with who you sleep with then what

293
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:00,369
how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend your money and what you</font>

294
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,019
think and what you say and those are

295
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:03,969
always the things that the government<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

296
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:05,019
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take away from you the</font>

297
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:06,609
government doesn't care who you sleep

298
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:08,589
with that causes no problem for them

299
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:10,149
whatsoever they care what you say and

300
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:12,389
they care how you spend your money

301
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:15,069
conservatives simply believe that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

302
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:17,079
earn<font color="#CCCCCC"> the money it's yours and the</font>

303
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:18,369
government has a right<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take it away</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">from you to pay for the common defense</font>

00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,829
and there I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so sure about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,669
just a basic basic conservative

314
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:41,499
principle that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government does not</font>

315
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:43,509
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right to do that it's not in</font>

316
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:45,309
the Constitution so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government does</font>

317
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:46,479
the federal<font color="#E5E5E5"> government doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

318
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:47,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">right to do it whether the state</font>

319
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:49,059
governments do is a whole other question

320
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:51,929
and certainly whether independent

321
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:54,339
entities who want to create charities to

322
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,489
do it obviously that is the the best

323
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:58,989
conservative idea because remember and

324
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:00,789
the reason Republicans think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this reason</font>

325
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:02,409
conservatives think Lee sorry the reason

326
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:03,909
conservatives think this is the

327
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:06,579
government is never selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's always</font>

328
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:09,249
buying it is never giving you freedom it

329
00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:11,409
is always taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> power this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is true</font>

330
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:12,759
whether you're gay or whether you're

331
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,109
black and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they saying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you we're</font>

332
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,509
giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the power by through our</font>

333
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:17,919
through the Supreme<font color="#E5E5E5"> Court we're giving</font>

334
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">you the power to marry they're not</font>

335
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:22,119
they're taking away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from you the power</font>

336
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:24,879
to decide and giving it to five guys in

337
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,709
Washington who weren't elected by

338
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:29,079
anybody who suddenly are making laws for

339
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:30,069
the country which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

340
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:31,749
unconstitutional they're always taking

341
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:34,149
power they're never giving freedom never

342
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:35,319
so anything that the federal government

343
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:37,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">does is meant to expand the federal</font>

344
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,669
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it does the intentions</font>

345
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:41,409
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good some people believe oh you</font>

346
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:43,539
know I'm really helping out I get it but

347
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:45,159
that's the road to hell so what so what

348
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,719
they're never Trumper's are saying and

349
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,939
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> never Trump your problem Trumper's</font>

350
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:51,909
problem is is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is taking the</font>

351
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:54,309
conservative movement and moving it to

352
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:55,719
the left this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is taking our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sean</font>

353
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:57,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">hannity's and our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Laura Ingram's and our</font>

354
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,799
Dennis Prager and taking them out of the

355
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,569
right and putting into the left as they

356
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:03,579
follow Trump down this rabbit hole<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

357
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:04,839
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to continue to get bigger</font>

358
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,489
all the time because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is who Trump</font>

359
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:08,049
is you know Trump is following his

360
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:08,920
nature

361
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,680
so what they are saying is it might even

362
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,660
be better if Hillary if we had to endure

363
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,670
the tear the admittedly terrible

364
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,220
presidency of Hillary Clinton while we

365
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,589
rebuild a conservative movement and

366
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:22,959
remember movements thrive when they have

367
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,000
an enemy<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have Hillary Clinton in</font>

368
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,860
office people gathering around what's

369
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,449
wrong with what she's doing when Hillary

370
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:29,740
Clinton says i'm going to give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> child</font>

371
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">care suddenly sean hannity and laura</font>

372
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">ingraham i'm going to rediscover what it</font>

373
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,380
is they oppose about health about child

374
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,940
care and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go after her</font>

375
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,740
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that the nevertrump</font>

376
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,649
is are saying it's going to be easier to

377
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:43,630
rebuild the conservative movement with a

378
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">hillary in office no matter how bad she</font>

379
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,250
is then with Trump who's going to not

380
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,019
only take the country to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

381
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:51,040
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take the conservative</font>

382
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,990
movement with it and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

383
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,430
nevertrump<font color="#E5E5E5"> purrs are saying and I will</font>

384
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you what I think in just a minute</font>

385
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,279
but first I have to say goodbye<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>
