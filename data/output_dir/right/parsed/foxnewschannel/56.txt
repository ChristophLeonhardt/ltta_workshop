>> Bill: 9:15 IN NEW YORK.
BIG DAY TOMORROW IN WASHINGTON
DEPUTY A.G. ROD ROSENSTEIN
EXPECTED TO FACE TOUGH
QUESTIONS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS
IN FRONT OF LAWMAKERS FROM TWO
HOUSE COMMITTEES.
SOME REPUBLICANS DO NOT LIKE
THE FORMAT.
WANT TO BRING IN TOM FITTON,
PRESIDENT OF JUDICIAL WATCH.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
JUST SO OUR VIEWERS KNOW, THEY
TOOK ABOUT 30 LAWMAKERS AND
TOOK IT DOWN TO FOUR.
TWO REPUBLICANS AND TWO
DEMOCRATS.
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?
>> OF COURSE NOT.
THIS WILL BE SECRET OND
TESTIMONY AND IF YOU TRY TO GET
FACTS FROM GETTING OUT TO THE
REPUBLICAN THIS IS THE WAY YOU
DO IT.
THE FACT THAT A
REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED HOUSE
WOULDN'T LET MORE REPUBLICANS
IN TO QUESTION ROD ROSENSTEIN
ABOUT WHETHER HE AND THE F.B.I.
WERE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO
REMOVE THE PRESIDENT FROM
OFFICE, THE FACT THAT THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T WANT
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OF
CONGRESS, CONGRESS IN THIS CASE
IS WAY TOO DEFER ENTIONALL.
>> Bill: YOU KNOW GOODLATTE AND
GOWDY.
DO YOU NOT TRUST THAT THEY ASK
THE APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS?
>> I DON'T TRUST THAT THE
INFORMATION WILL GET OUT TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE IN A TIMELY WAY
AND I DON'T TRUST THAT
GENERALLY SPEAKING MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS AND CONGRESSIONAL
COMMITTEES DOING THESE TYPES OF
INVESTIGATIONS BEHIND CLOSED
DOORS.
A SERIES OF OTHER WITNESSES
RECENTLY QUESTIONED.
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY
SAID.
I'M TIRED OF THESE SECRET
TESTIMONIES BEFORE CONGRESS.
>> Bill: ONE MORE QUESTION AND
I'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT AREA.
GOODLATTE SAYS LAWMAKERS WILL
BE ALLOWED TO VIEW THE
CLASSIFIED VERSION OF THE
INTERVIEW BEFORE AN
UNCLASSIFIED ONE IS MADE PUBLIC.
>> WHEN WILL THE UNCLASSIFIED
ONE GOING TO BE MADE PUBLIC?
THAT'S THE QUESTION I HAVE.
THE SAME JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
THAT DOESN'T WANT TO ANSWER THE
QUESTIONS WILL BE DECLASSIFYING
MATERIAL.
I THINK THAT'S A CONFLICT.
>> Bill: WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
THESE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO
GET FROM ROSENSTEIN?
>> WELL, I SUSPECT HE WILL SAY
WHAT HE HAS BEEN SAYING
PRIVATELY IN RESPONSE TO
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS MEETING
WITH THE F.B.I. ABOUT
WIRETAPPING THE PRESIDENT,
INVOKING 25th AMENDMENT THAT HE
WAS JOKING ABOUT THE
WIRETAPPING.
HE DIDN'T SAY HE WAS JOKING
ABOUT INVOKING THE 25th
AMENDMENT.
ALSO DISCUSSED AT THAT MEETING
IN THIS MEETING ABOUT
OVERTHROWING THE PRESIDENT,
REMOVING HIM FROM OFFICE WAS
GETTING A SPECIAL COUNSEL
APPOINTED.
I JUST HOPE THEY FOCUS ON THE
APPOINTMENT OF THE SPECIAL
COUNSEL.
THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE MUELLER
OPERATION AND PROTECTING THE
MUELLER OPERATION FROM BEING
QUESTIONED ABOUT ITS CORE --
ABOUT THE WAY IT WAS CREATED.
IT WAS CREATED BECAUSE ROD
ROSENSTEIN THOUGHT HE WAS UNDER
THE GUN FROM DEMOCRATS AND
GETTING PRESSURE ABOUT COMEY
BEING FIRED AND ALSO A WITNESS
IN THE FIRING AND TO WASH HIS
HANDS OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR HE
APPOINTED MR. MUELLER, AND ON
TOP OF THAT YOU HAD COMEY
PRESSURING ROSENSTEIN, HIS
FRIEND, BY STEALING AND THEN
RELEASING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
F.B.I. RECORDS.
UNBELIEVABLE CIRCUMSTANCES.
>> Bill: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
THE PRESIDENT SAYING HE HAS NO
PLANS TO FIRE ROSENSTEIN?
THAT'S BEEN A PARLOR GAME IN
WASHINGTON, D.C. FOR SOME TIME.
>> HE MAY HAVE NO PLANS TODAY
BUT HE MAY HAVE PLANS TOMORROW.
>> Bill: WE'LL SEE WHICH WAY
THE WIND BLOWS.
NOW, A FINAL QUESTION.
YOU DO NOT GIVE THE IMPRESSION
AT ALL THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE
SATISFIED FROM THIS DESPITE THE
FACT THAT ROSENSTEIN FINALLY
WILL BE .  THERE
>> THIS IS WHY JUDICIAL WATCH
DOES ITS OWN INVESTIGATIONS,
BECAUSE CONGRESS ISN'T
NECESSARILY THE BEST VEHICLE
FOR TRANSPARENCY.
AND GETTING QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
WE OFTEN GET DOCUMENTS ABOUT
KEY MEETINGS LIKE THIS
SOMETIMES BEFORE CONGRESS DID.
FOR INSTANCE, THE -- THE SHADY
FISA WARRANT APPLICATIONS
JUDICIAL OBTAINED BEFORE THE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
WE'LL BE DOING OUR OWN WORK
BECAUSE WE DON'T EXPECT MUCH
FROM CONGRESS.
HERE YOU HAVE CONGRESS
BASICALLY GETTING DOWN AND
ALLOWING MR. ROSENSTEIN TO WALK
