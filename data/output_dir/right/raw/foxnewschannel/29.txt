00:00:08,854 --> 00:00:09,721
>> WHAT HAPPENS WHEN DEMOCRATS

2
00:00:09,722 --> 00:00:10,154
ARE IN CHARGE?

3
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:11,222
SOMETIMES THEY GROW UP.

4
00:00:11,223 --> 00:00:13,391
>> ILLEGAL ALIENS SHOULD NOT BE

5
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:14,125
TREATED THE SAME AS PEOPLE WHO

6
00:00:14,126 --> 00:00:16,527
ENTER THE U.S. LEGALLY.

7
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:19,864
>> I VOTED NUMEROUS TIMES WHEN I

8
00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:22,967
WAS A SENATOR TO SPEND MONEY TO

9
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:27,004
BUILD A BARRIER TO TRY TO

10
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:27,772
PREVENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM

11
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:30,041
COMING IN.

12
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:32,643
>> WE SIMPLY CANNOT ALLOW PEOPLE

13
00:00:32,644 --> 00:00:34,345
TO POUR INTO THE UNITED STATES

14
00:00:34,346 --> 00:00:36,347
UNDETECTED, UNDOCUMENTED,

15
00:00:36,348 --> 00:00:37,415
UNCHECKED.

16
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,616
>> Greg: WOW.

17
00:00:38,617 --> 00:00:39,350
WHO ARE THESE BIGOTS AND WHERE

18
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:41,219
THEY SAW HIM INTO ILLEGAL

19
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:41,953
IMMIGRANTS.

20
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:42,720
ACTUALLY, THEY WERE BEING

21
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:44,489
ADULTS, BECAUSE THEY WERE IN

22
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,356
CHARGE ONCE.

23
00:00:45,357 --> 00:00:47,625
NOW NO LONGER IN POWER, THEY

24
00:00:47,626 --> 00:00:48,292
DEPEND ON THE REPUBLICANS TO

25
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:50,228
PLAY GROWN-UP AND THEY BE THE

26
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:51,796
CASE AS THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS

27
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:52,797
COME OUR WAY.

28
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:54,699
FACT IS, THEY NEED REPUBLICANS

29
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,835
TO BE THE BAD GUYS, I.E., THE

30
00:00:57,836 --> 00:00:58,870
ADULTS, SO THEY TAKE STANCES

31
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:00,371
THEY DON'T EVEN LIKE.

32
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:02,607
WE'VE BEEN WATCHING THEM OFF OR

33
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:03,474
EMOTIONALLY LOPSIDED VIEWS THAN

34
00:01:03,475 --> 00:01:05,410
THEY CLEAR YOU AND ME FOR

35
00:01:05,411 --> 00:01:06,043
BRINGING UP CONSEQUENCES.

36
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:07,678
BUT IMAGINE IF THERE WERE NO

37
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:10,047
BORDER CONSTRAINTS TO STOP THE

38
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:10,581
CARAVAN.

39
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:11,816
IMAGINE IF WE JUST HOMED JOHN

40
00:01:11,817 --> 00:01:12,817
LENNON SONGS AS WE WAVED

41
00:01:12,818 --> 00:01:13,317
EVERYONE THROUGH.

42
00:01:13,318 --> 00:01:15,286
OF COURSE, YOU WOULD ONLY LAUNCH

43
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:17,021
A DOZEN NEW CARAVANS, EACH

44
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:19,090
FILLED WITH KNOWNS AND UNKNOWNS.

45
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:20,391
IT'S OBVIOUS.

46
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:21,893
WAIT, THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING.

47
00:01:21,894 --> 00:01:22,794
THAT'S A CONSEQUENCE.

48
00:01:22,795 --> 00:01:23,795
WHY AREN'T THE DEMOCRATS

49
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:24,729
WORRIED?

50
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,396
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE

51
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:26,564
REPUBLICANS IN THE U.S. BORDER

52
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:28,699
PATROL WILL END UP BEING THE BAD

53
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,000
GUYS.

54
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:30,301
WE ALWAYS ARE.

55
00:01:30,302 --> 00:01:31,102
AND BAIL THEM OUT.

56
00:01:31,103 --> 00:01:31,969
IT'S PERFECT FOR DEMOCRATS

57
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,606
BECAUSE REALLY, IT'S ALL ABOUT

58
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:36,040
FEELING GOOD.

59
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:39,377
IT'S ALL THEATER, AND THE EVIL

60
00:01:39,378 --> 00:01:41,612
CHARACTERS OR ANYONE WHO THINKS

61
00:01:41,613 --> 00:01:43,681
CRITICALLY, AND A HERO, THE

62
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:44,415
PROGRESSIVE WHO PUSHES EMOTION

63
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,384
WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE, AND HE WINS

64
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:47,952
BECAUSE HE CAN FAKE EMPATHY,

65
00:01:47,953 --> 00:01:50,021
STILL HAVE A BORDER, AND A

66
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:51,022
VILLAIN TO BLAME IT ON.

67
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:52,790
IT'S GREAT BEING A KID.

68
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,725
YOU CAN DEMAND THE DUMBEST

69
00:01:54,726 --> 00:01:55,660
THINGS AND SECRETLY HOPE YOUR

70
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:56,327
PARENTS AREN'T LISTENING.

71
00:01:56,328 --> 00:01:59,030
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY THEORY,

72
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,031
DANA, THAT THE DEMOCRATS NEED

73
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:01,799
REPUBLICANS TO BE THE BAD GUYS

74
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,834
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE

75
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:04,535
GOING TO PULL THE BAND-AID OFF,

76
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:06,904
THEY ARE GOING TO GROUND THE

77
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:09,040
STUDENTS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

78
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,042
>> Dana: I WAS THINKING ABOUT

79
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:14,178
A BLIND TASTE TEST, JUST TO

80
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:14,879
COMMENTS FROM REPUBLICANS AND

81
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,514
DEMOCRATS WHEN THEY WERE IN

82
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:19,283
CHARGE AND THEN REPUBLICANS AND

83
00:02:19,284 --> 00:02:21,018
THE GEORGE BUSH TERM, THEN

84
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:21,486
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

85
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:22,620
BLIND TEST.

86
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:23,187
READ THEM.

87
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:25,590
I THINK IT WOULD BE HARD-PRESSED

88
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:26,390
TO FIND ANY DISAGREEMENT.

89
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:27,825
THAT IS WHAT IS SO FRUSTRATING

90
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:28,993
ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

91
00:02:28,994 --> 00:02:30,628
>> Greg: MY THEORY, EMILY,

92
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:31,796
WHEN YOU ARE OUT OF POWER, YOU

93
00:02:31,797 --> 00:02:33,397
CAN SAY THINGS YOU REALLY DON'T

94
00:02:33,398 --> 00:02:34,732
MEAN, THEN YOU GET INTO POWER,

95
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,400
SUDDENLY YOU GROW UP AND GO,

96
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:40,037
WELL, YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A

97
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:40,605
BORDER.

98
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:41,172
>> Emily: ABSOLUTELY.

99
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:42,840
JUST TO BUILD ON WHAT YOU SAID

100
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:45,476
IN YOUR OPENING, I THINK THAT

101
00:02:45,477 --> 00:02:46,744
THE LESS FRAMED, THE COVERAGE

102
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:48,880
AND CONVERSATION, EITHER IT IS

103
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:50,481
EMOTIONAL AND MORAL OR YOU ARE

104
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:51,983
TOTALLY DEVOID OF COMPASSION.

105
00:02:51,984 --> 00:02:53,551
AND YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH.

106
00:02:53,552 --> 00:02:56,220
THE IRONY TO ME IS THE FACT THAT

107
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:58,256
THAT ALL     ALL-OR-NOTHING APPO

108
00:02:58,257 --> 00:02:58,289
THAT ALL     ALL-OR-NOTHING APPC

109
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:58,589
THAT ALL     ALL-OR-NOTHING APPH

110
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,991
DOES A DISTURBANCE IN THAT

111
00:02:59,992 --> 00:03:02,193
COMPASSION ARENA TO ALL OF THE P

112
00:03:02,194 --> 00:03:02,226
COMPASSION ARENA TO ALL OF THE O

113
00:03:02,227 --> 00:03:02,260
COMPASSION ARENA TO ALL OF THE L

114
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:02,760
COMPASSION ARENA TO ALL OF THE ,

115
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:02,793
COMPASSION ARENA TO ALL OF THE T

116
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:03,361
COMPASSION ARENA TO ALL OF THE E

117
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:03,394
COMPASSION ARENA TO ALL OF THE M

118
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:03,427
COMPASSION ARENA TO ALL OF THE G

119
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:03,461
COMPASSION ARENA TO ALL OF THE A

120
00:03:03,462 --> 00:03:03,494
COMPASSION ARENA TO ALL OF THE T

121
00:03:03,495 --> 00:03:04,195
COMPASSION ARENA TO ALL OF THE S

122
00:03:04,196 --> 00:03:05,796
INCLUDED, AND ALL THE CENTRAL

123
00:03:05,797 --> 00:03:07,365
AMERICAN AND SOME SOUTHERN

124
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:08,199
AMERICAN COUNTRIES THAT ARE

125
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,301
AFFECTED IN A MULTITUDE OF

126
00:03:10,302 --> 00:03:10,902
AREAS, ECONOMICALLY AND

127
00:03:10,903 --> 00:03:13,404
POLITICALLY AND CRIMINALLY.

128
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:14,805
THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER ISSUES

129
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:18,142
THAT I WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE

130
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:19,410
THE GREATER HUMANITARIAN AND

131
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:21,078
COMPASSIONATE POSITION TO BE

132
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,446
HONEST AND COMPLEX ABOUT THAT

133
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:24,782
COVERAGE AND CONVERSATION.

134
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:26,350
>> Greg: JESSE, I THINK THERE

135
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,618
IS A LOT OF DISHONESTY AND

136
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:28,853
PUSHING AN EVENT THAT HAS NO

137
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:30,888
POSITIVE OUTCOME FOR THE PEOPLE

138
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:31,389
INVOLVED.

139
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,990
SOONER OR LATER THEY'RE GOING TO

140
00:03:32,991 --> 00:03:34,659
HIT SOMETHING THAT ISN'T GOING

141
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,359
TO LET THEM IN.

142
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,928
EVERYBODY ELSE CAN WALK AWAY AND

143
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:37,795
DO ANOTHER STORY.

144
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:39,497
THIS STORY MAY BE OVER IN A

145
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:41,766
COUPLE OF DAYS, BUT YOU KNOW IT?

146
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:42,867
WE HAVE INCITED A COUPLE OF

147
00:03:42,868 --> 00:03:44,135
CARAVANS AND THEY ARE GOING TO

148
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:46,170
FAIL AT SOME POINT.

149
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:48,439
>> Jesse: THEY ARE, AND I'M

150
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,107
THE MOST COMPASSIONATE GUY AT

151
00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:50,575
THIS TABLE.

152
00:03:50,576 --> 00:03:51,776
>> Greg: I BELIEVE THAT.

153
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:53,010
AT LEAST THE TOP FIVE.

154
00:03:53,011 --> 00:03:54,946
>> Jesse: YET I'M PORTRAYED AS

155
00:03:54,947 --> 00:03:56,948
MEAN-SPIRITED BECAUSE I WANT TO

156
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:58,149
MAINTAIN THE TERRITORIAL

157
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,983
INTEGRITY AND SOVEREIGNTY OF THE

158
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:00,017
UNITED STATES AND COUNTRY THAT I

159
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:00,618
LOVE.

160
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:01,419
I TREAT THIS COUNTRY LIKE A

161
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:01,786
HOUSE.

162
00:04:01,787 --> 00:04:04,221
I WANT TO KNOW WHO IS COMING IN,

163
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:05,289
AND I WANT TO INVITE THEM WHEN

164
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,358
THEY COME IN, AND I THINK EVERY

165
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:09,961
AMERICAN AGREES WITH ME.

166
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:11,796
AND I WANT HUNGRY FOREIGNERS TO

167
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:13,764
COME TO AMERICA AND MAKE MONEY

168
00:04:13,765 --> 00:04:15,967
AND ACHIEVE SUCCESS, BUT I ALSO

169
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:17,335
DON'T LIKE FOREIGNERS

170
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:19,303
CONTROLLING U.S. IMMIGRATION

171
00:04:19,303 --> 00:04:19,970
POLICY.

172
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:21,204
I'D LIKE AMERICANS TO CONTROL

173
00:04:21,206 --> 00:04:22,907
U.S. IMMIGRATION POLICY.

174
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:26,277
SO WHEN YOU SEE A BUNCH OF

175
00:04:26,278 --> 00:04:28,879
IMPOVERISHED STRANGERS FROM

176
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,116
CENTRAL AMERICA KIND OF

177
00:04:32,117 --> 00:04:34,118
HOSTILITY RUSHING NORTH, AND

178
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:35,353
THEY ARE CHANTING THINGS ABOUT

179
00:04:35,354 --> 00:04:37,788
OUR PRESIDENT AND WEARING

180
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:38,823
T-SHIRTS THAT KIND OF ARE A

181
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:40,558
LITTLE DEFENSIVE AND THEY ARE

182
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,292
PAYING COYOTES CASH AND WHEN

183
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:43,561
THEY MEET UP WITH A BUNCH OF

184
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:45,296
LAWYERS FROM THE ACLU SOUTH OF

185
00:04:45,297 --> 00:04:46,631
THE BORDER AND THEY ARE COACHED

186
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:49,634
ON WHAT TO SAY IN ORDER TO GET,

187
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:51,168
A LOT OF AMERICANS LOOK AT THAT

188
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:52,970
AND ARE A LITTLE UNEASY ON THAT.

189
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:55,006
ALL WE ARE SAYING IS, DON'T CUT

190
00:04:55,007 --> 00:04:55,373
IN LINE.

191
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:57,575
COME HERE IN AN ORDERLY PROCESS.

192
00:04:57,576 --> 00:04:59,810
WE WANT A FAIR AND ORDERLY

193
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:00,778
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM.

194
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:03,180
BUT WE ALSO WANT COMPASSION FOR

195
00:05:03,181 --> 00:05:06,150
AMERICANS.

196
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:09,320
YUMA AND, I THINK, ARIZONA,

197
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:10,388
BEING OVERWHELMED BY IMMIGRANTS

198
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:11,922
WHO ARE JUST DUMB TO BARBECUE

199
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:12,591
BORDER PATROL BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

200
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:13,391
HOLD THEM.

201
00:05:13,392 --> 00:05:18,262
THE TOWNSPEOPLE OF YUMA ARE

202
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:21,499
FEELING LIKE, WHAT IS HAPPENING

203
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,166
TO OUR TOWN?

204
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:24,101
WE DIDN'T VOTE FOR THIS, WHERE

205
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:27,538
IS THE COMPASSION FOR THEM?

206
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,141
>> Greg: JUAN, A SECOND

207
00:05:30,142 --> 00:05:30,808
CARAVAN STARTING, OBVIOUSLY

208
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:32,977
THEY'RE GETTING ENCOURAGEMENT BY

209
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:35,946
SEEING THIS ONE, THEN THEY START

210
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:36,547
ANOTHER, SO THAT IS THE

211
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:39,150
CONSEQUENCE OF THIS.

212
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:40,584
>> Juan: I THINK IT IS THE

213
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:42,153
CONSEQUENCE OF THE FAILURE OF

214
00:05:42,154 --> 00:05:44,355
THIS PRESIDENT TO ENACT ANY KIND

215
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:45,389
OF IMMIGRATION POLICY.

216
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,457
OBVIOUSLY THE HORRIBLE THINGS HE

217
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,659
WAS DOING TO CHILDREN AT THE

218
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,761
BORDER HAS NOT ACTED AS A

219
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:51,195
DISINCENTIVE.

220
00:05:51,196 --> 00:05:54,498
IN FACT, NOW WE SEE INSTANCES

221
00:05:54,499 --> 00:05:56,333
LIKE -- I WANTED TO SAY TO YOU,

222
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:59,970
GREG, THAT TO ME, I WAS THINKING

223
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:02,139
TO MYSELF, WOW, SO I GUESS THE

224
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,642
DEMOCRATS CLEARLY ARE NOT PEOPLE

225
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:07,611
WHO ARE OPPOSED TO BORDERS OR

226
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:09,480
OPPOSED TO KEEPING ILLEGALS OUT.

227
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:11,982
WHAT WE SAW AT THE TOP OF THIS

228
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:12,750
SEGMENT WAS DEMOCRATS SAYING, WE

229
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:15,419
NEED BORDERS, WE NEED LEGITIMATE

230
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,120
PROTECTION, BUT MAYBE WE DON'T

231
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:17,755
NEED A WALL THAT'S NOT GOING TO

232
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:18,889
BE EFFECTIVE.

233
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,858
BUT THE SECOND THING TO SAY HERE

234
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:25,362
IS THAT, AGAIN, YOU DEMONIZE

235
00:06:25,363 --> 00:06:26,197
PEOPLE, AND TODAY, RIGHT-WING

236
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:28,165
MEDIA FIGHTS WERE SHOWING A

237
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,867
PICTURE OF WHAT LOOKED LIKE A

238
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:33,337
BEATEN MEXICAN COP, THE PICTURE

239
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:39,977
WAS FROM 2012.

240
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:42,913
>> Greg: I DIDN'T DEMONIZE

241
00:06:42,914 --> 00:06:43,347
ANYBODY, JUAN.

242
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:44,815
>> Juan: IT RATHER THAN SAYING

243
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:46,117
THAT WE HAVE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS

244
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:49,153
RIGHT NOW AND THAT WE NEED TO HE

245
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:49,787
RIGHT NOW AND THAT WE NEED TO HP

246
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:50,554
PEOPLE AND DEAL WITH THIS CRISIS

247
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:54,391
SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE NEW LINES

248
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:55,259
FORMING, INSTEAD, THE OAKLEY

249
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,994
EMPHASIS IS ON, OH, THE

250
00:06:56,995 --> 00:07:00,731
DEMOCRATS ARE ON THE BAD ONE.

251
00:07:00,732 --> 00:07:02,166
I WISH REPUBLICANS WOULD SAY,

252
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:03,968
YOU KNOW WHAT, I UNDERSTAND,

253
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:05,402
THAT SOMEBODY IS PUSHING A FAIR

254
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:06,537
BUTTON, AND IT'S THE KIND OF

255
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:09,740
THING THAT THEN LEADS PEOPLE TO

256
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:10,674
CONCLUDE, OH, WE SHOULD GO AFTER

257
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:10,909
THE DEMOCRATS.

258
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:14,379
>> Greg: >> Emily: , JUAN,

259
00:07:14,813 --> 00:07:16,781
I THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO SAY THAT

260
00:07:16,782 --> 00:07:18,015
THEY DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE

261
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:19,350
PROBLEM.

262
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:20,518
THEY HAVE TRIED TO CHANGE, AND

263
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,253
WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE BALL WON'T

264
00:07:22,254 --> 00:07:23,587
WORK, I DISAGREE WITH YOU.

265
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:24,955
DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT THE BALL

266
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:27,725
BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT WILL WORK.

267
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:28,659
>> Juan: IT WON'T WORK.

268
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,628
>> Greg: IF I WANTED TO GROW

269
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:32,963
WHY WON'T IT WORK?

270
00:07:32,964 --> 00:07:33,931
>> Juan: I'LL TELL YOU

271
00:07:33,932 --> 00:07:34,265
QUICKLY.

272
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:36,534
MOST PEOPLE THAT COME INTO THIS

273
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:37,835
COUNTRY, AND OVERSTAY VISAS,

274
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:42,573
THEY COME ON AIRPLANES -- COATS

275
00:07:42,574 --> 00:07:44,008
SPEWING THE WALL WON'T PREVENT

276
00:07:44,009 --> 00:00:00,000
PEOPLE FROM COMING OVER ON AN
