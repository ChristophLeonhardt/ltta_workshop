the vote on the Senate healthcare bills been pushed back until after a short recess which under normal circumstances means that this would be an opportunity for Americans who around the country to let their Senators know what they think about this bill and whether it should be passed by attending town halls but we don't live in normal times and there will be no town halls in fact not even just in this recess town halls have effectively ended at this point because people were apparently providing too much democracy to these senators let's take a look at this infographic that was put together it's going to show you the number of town halls for Republican congressional Republicans per month and you're seeing there you know 31 38 in March up to 64 and April which sounds good I mean theoretically there are hundreds of Republican representatives and you could hold more than one a month so that numbers still probably pretty small but look at it dropping off as the pressure turns up on them when the conversation switches to health care reform it drops to almost a third in May then it has again in June and the entire month of July where they have the the end of one recess in the beginning of another has two town halls for hundreds of Republicans when the country is in an uproar about a massive piece of legislation that we know is aided by most of the country - town halls yeah so you might be surprised that I'm slightly mixed on this story I'll tell you what look indivisible it's not just them but largely them has done a great job of rallying people to town halls I think they started out wonderful i i'll leave aside there some of their issues today but anyway but they rallied people and they got people to the town halls so and it provided for a great video and if you're a republican politician you don't want that video out there people yelling at you and you know what's coming you know the other side is organized well by the way you did the same thing during obamacare so you know how that goes so you think why the hell would I want to go and they theoretically if the facts in your side you could answer people's concerns exactly so that's why I say I'm slightly mixed now overall should they go of course and I'll tell you why if you have BS talking points you don't want to go anywhere you're those town halls okay by the way I also wouldn't go to those town halls if I thought the people who were fake what I mean my fake is if they were paid to attend there etc but if they're your real constituents they were rallied by someone you consider an opponent to show up there but they are actually your constituents and they are earnest that they're not you know they're actually real concerned citizens and you think you're right of course you should show up you should spend hours there with people and and you know what people would do they would appreciate it if you actually spent all that time with them you wouldn't leave you wouldn't leave for two hours three hours for five hours until you answer people's questions and went back and forth and back and forth and cut and consistently saying to them look we're not all going to agree but here's why I did it here's what I think your health care is going to be better I think here's why I think you're gonna pay less here's why I think you're gonna get more coverage here's why I think your mom is gonna be covered your uncle and your aunt's gonna be covered and so by the end they might respect you and think oh we have a difference of opinion he is trying to get to the right goal which is more coverage and cheaper and more affordable and accessible he just has a different opinion on it now the reason that we're down to two town halls is because the Republicans don't think that and they know it so how are you going to go and real talk to your real constituents and tell them no no the richest people in the country need another 800 billion dollar tax break that's why less of you will be covered your mom might not be covered if you're above the age of 60 you might pay four times as much and get less coverage that is an indefensible position so the one place they do show up is to the fundraisers and hang out with the Koch brothers because that is where they are very well received that's where the cry crowd cheers and goes nice job job well done hurrah for congressman X who gives exactly what we paid for we're not the Young Turks you're The Young Turks you power this show together we build something amazing we broken stories like the Donna Brazile story the mainstream media wouldn't we built the studio we built this network it's now number one all thanks to you guys let's come build it even bigger and stronger TYT Network comm /join
