hey everybody it appears that over in Turkey a guy named Ken Jamal Khashoggi goes into the Saudi embassy and doesn't come out and this is a huge giant deal for America why this is take that with kirt Schlichter look here's what the Turks are saying the Turks are saying this this Khashoggi guy goes into this Saudi embassy doesn't come out in fact they're saying that they killed the guy chopped him up into little pieces and did something with the body what the hell that's horrible that's awful that's ugly that's also not our problem okay who benefits if there is a break between the United States and Saudi Arabia because that seems to be the intent here this is this murder if it was because we haven't seen a body we just have turkeys allegations and Turkey may not be the most reliable bunch of people not saying that the Saudis wouldn't do it Saudis are well known for chopping people they don't like up however we don't actually know what happens but let's assume the worse case let's assume the Saudis killed this this Saudi dissident that's a bad thing okay you shouldn't chop people up not even guys like Khashoggi who's screwed around with Islamic terrorists who is apparently no friend of freedom and you know just generally not a great guy but again you you probably shouldn't take him into your embassy and kill him and chop them into little bits this is this is a bad thing but then again why is it America's problem because look we're not allies with the Saudis because we like the Saudis we're not friends with the Saudis because they're cool people all right I've actually been in Saudi Arabia I spent a lot of time there and I don't like them very much I remember during Desert Storm I was you know kind of on the border of northern Saudi Arabia looking north towards Iraq and I didn't see any Saudis between me and the border right and all I could think of uh see how my country was in danger of invasion you think I'd let some foreigners be on the front line sizing every prom with it I'm not a big fan yet you know who I'm less of a fan of I'm less of a fan of Iran because you know for all the problems with the Saudis and they got plenty Iran is actively killing Americans Iran has actively killed hundreds maybe thousands of American soldiers in Iraq assisting Shiite militias and they're back in guys in Syria who are bad dudes you know Assad and all the rest and the Turks are interfering there it's a giant mess and the Iraqis oh the Iranians they also want to get the bomb and down Turks understand how the leverage works there's a bunch of Americans who are really upset because the signature foreign policy achievement of Barack Obama that is giving in to the mullahs and letting them get nuclear weapons in exchange for us paying the money yes that's literally the deal they got to do whatever they want and we gave them billions of dollars include pallets of cash um they're really upset about that and to show they're upset yeah they seem to be signing and Sasaki's well I'm not really for the Saudis but I am for the United States and I'm kind of more for people who are not our enemies than people who are again Saudis are not nice cats they're actually kind of annoying I don't particularly like them very much but you know what they're sticking with us and they're not screwing with Israel the way they work they're helping us fight the Iranians and they're doing it in Yemen where there's a real proxy war going on and if all he'll go if everything goes to hell about Iran if Iran insists on trying to get nuclear weapons as it will you know it's gonna be our buddies the Saudis who are sitting beside us look I'm again I'm not for dismembering political opponent I think that's a bad thing but then again I think the Saudis are bad people but sometimes you have to be with bad people and we should understand that and accept that to some extent now the the king of Saudi Arabia insists you know I didn't know anything about this to Pompeo and Trump and of course Pompeo and rub what the hell do they know Turks aid in the Turks don't like us very much the Saudis say they didn't they're our allies what the hell are we supposed to do side with turkey Turkey hates us right now Turkey fruitcake holds us in contempt yeah I know there are NATO country doesn't matter look it's time to get real it's time to get a dolt this is a tough world full of bad people and sometimes you got to choose the less bad people I'm not saying excuse this murder if it happened we don't know if it happened but but people seem pretty sure it did we don't have to excuse it we don't have to like it but we need to know who's on our side in a fight and we're in a fight to the death in the Middle East against radical Islam the Saudis for all their problems are a useful Ally and we should remember that doesn't mean we excuse them when they do horrible things but it means that we understand like adults do that sometimes in the world of foreign policy in the in protecting your civilization sometimes you gotta get your hands dirty not that ours are dirty here we didn't do it we're just kind of on the sidelines and that's where we should stay this is take that
