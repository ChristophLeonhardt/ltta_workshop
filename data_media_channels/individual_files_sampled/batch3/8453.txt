DISCRIMINATE AGAINST AMERICANS BY HIRING FOREIGN VISA WORKERS THAT WILL WORK, YES, FOR LOWER WAGES. ABBY? ABBY: THANK YOU, ED. MORE AND MORE STATES ARE LEGALIZING POT. NINE NOW LEGALIZING FOR RECREATIONAL USE INCLUDING COLORADO. THIS AS A RECENT SURVEY FOUND A NUMBER OF COMPANIES IN COLORADO TESTING FOR MARIJUANA IS ON THE DECLINE SO IS THIS A GOOD IDEA? HIRE TO DEBATE FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR FOR THE WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY UNDER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA AND AUTHOR OF THE BOOK REEFER SANITY. SEVEN GREAT MYTH ALSO MARIJUANA. GOOD MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. GOOD MORNING. ABBY: THIS IS NOT TO DEBATE WHETHER YOU ARE PRO-OR LEGAL RIDING MARIJUANA. SURVEY SHOWING THAT MORE COMPANIES ARE JUST OPTING OUT OF TESTING THEIR EMPLOYERS FOR THE USE OF MARIJUANA. IS THAT SOMETHING PEOPLE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT? WELL, IT IS. FIRST OF ALL, IN COLORADO, THE CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS HAS HAD TO HIRE OUT OF STATE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND PEOPLE TO PASS A DRUG TEST. WE NEED PEOPLE TO PASS DRUG TESTS WHO ARE ESPECIALLY IN SAFETY SENSITIVE CONDITIONS. I DON'T WANT MY PILOT AND DOCTOR AND KID'S BUS DRIVER TO BE TESTING POSITIVE FOR MARIJUANA. I THINK THIS IS VERY BAD NEWS. TODAY'S POT IS SO MUCH MORE HARMFUL THAN IT USED TO BE. THC CONTENT POTENCY IS 10 TO 30 TIMES GREATER. ALL THESE EDIBLES, CANDIES AND COOKIES AND OILS. WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER TOBACCO INDUSTRY. WE ARE REELING OFF OF BIG PHARMA OPIATE CRISIS BY DO WE WANT BIG MARIJUANA? IT'S A BAD IDEA AND TERRIBLE FOR AMERICAN JOBS AND FOR THE WORKFORCE. ABBY: CAROLINE, CRITICS TO THIS DAY SAY LEGALIZING MARIJUANA CAN ULTIMATELY LEAD TO MORE CRIMES, MAYBE MORE USE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS. I TALK TO MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME. SOMEHOW THAT ANY DIFFERENT THAN PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO DRINK ALCOHOL? , UNLIMITED AMOUNTS OF ALCOHOL. YOU COMPARE THE TWO AND WONDERING WHY ONE IS TOTALLY ILLEGAL ISLEGAL IS TGAL IS TOTL IS TOTALLY LEGAL AND ONE IS NOT. ABSOLUTELY TRUE. TALK ABOUT BIG ALCOHOL. THERE HAVE BEEN MAJOR MISTAKES MADE IN BIG ALCOHOL AND BIG TOBACCO THAT THE CAN BUSINESS INDUSTRY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM. PEOPLE IN THE CAN BUSINESS INDUSTRY ARE READY TO WORK WITH STATE REGULATORS, TO ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE PUT IN PLACE SO ADULTS CAN CONSUME CAN BUSINESS WHEN AND WHERE THEY SHOULD. ABBY: LOOK AT RECENT POLLING ON, THIS BECAUSE IT'S CHANGED PRETTY QUICKLY OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS. RECENT CBS POLL SHOWS 6 IN 10 NOW, MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SUPPORT LEGALIZING MARIJUANA. YOU LOOK AT THEIR POLL JUST 6 OR 7 YEARS AGO. IT WAS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING ACTUALLY WHEN YOU WORD THE POLLING DIFFERENTLY YOU GET A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ANSWER. WHEN YOU GIVE PEOPLE THE CHOICE OF DECRIMINALIZATION WHICH IS ABOUT NOT PUTTING PEOPLE IN PRISON WHICH I AGREE WITH FOR MARIJUANA VERSUS SELLING IT AND MAKING AN INDUSTRY OUT OF IT. THE DECRIMINALIZATION PART IS MORE POPULAR THAN LEGALIZATION. SO, ACTUALLY, WHEN YOU ASK THE YES, NO. YOU MIGHT GET THAT ANSWER. REALITY IS ALCOHOL IS IN AND OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM WITHIN 24 HOURS. THC IS FAT SOLUBLE, INTOXICATED OFTEN AFTER YOU MIGHT FEEL INTOXICATED WHILE IT'S STILL IN YOUR SYSTEM. AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE DOING THIS FOR ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY. THAT'S TO MAKE MONEY. THIS IS ABOUT MONEY. THIS IS ABOUT MONEY FOR A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE. AND I DON'T THINK IT ENDS WELL. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE ARE SHUTTING THE DOOR ON BIG TOBACCO. YOU CAN'T SMOKE ANYWHERE. WE ARE SHUTTING THE DOOR ON BIG OPIATES AND OPENING THE DOOR TO BIG MARIJUANA. NOT GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY AND CERTAINLY NOT GOOD FOR OUR KIDS. ABBY: HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT. I WOULD COUNTER THAT BY LEGAL RIDING CAN BUSINESS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO WORK HAND IN HAND TOGETHER TONE SURE THAT DOCTORS, PATIENTS AND EMPLOYERS UNDERSTAND DOSING AND HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF IMPAIRMENT. WE HAVE NEVER GOT CONTINUE RIGHT BEFORE. WE HAD DOCTORS WITH THE OPIATE CRISIS. WE HAD DOCTORS BEING PAID FROM BIG TOBACCO. WE HAD THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY AS WELL. THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO FINALLY REGULATE. WE ALSO HAVE THOSE LESSONS TO REFLECT ON NOW. I WISH YOU WOULD THE PROBLEM IS THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY IS NOT INTERESTED IN THE LESSONS. THE CAN BUSINESS CHE CAN BUSINESS CAN CAN BUSINESS CAN AAN BUSINESS CAN ANY BUSINESS IS INTERESTED IN EQUITY AND BUILDING A NEW INDUSTRY THAT'S DIVERSE AND GIVE BACK TO PATIENTS, BUSINESS OWNERS AND COMMUNITY. THEY'RE NOT GIVING BACK. PEOPLE ARE STONED COMING INTO THEIR FACTORIES STONED. FLAWED INDUSTRY. ABBY: IT'S AN INTERESTING
