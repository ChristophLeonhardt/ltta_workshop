feminists have decreed that March 8th will be a day without a woman so ladies if you're planning to join this important event please remember to stock the refrigerator with sandwiches before you go so we'll have something to eat otherwise I know all US men will be dreading the moment women go on strike all day and wondering how on earth we're going to store up enough whiskey and cigars to get through an entire Jason Statham film festival but you know if women are going off on their own half of the day it only seems fair and partly it only seems fair that they should leave behind not just men but also all the things that men have given them over the years after all if you want us to learn how difficult it would be for men to get along without women then you should also have to learn how difficult it would be for women to get along without men so on day without a woman day how about women don't get to use anything that was invented or discovered by a man that would include democracy cars computers aspirin electricity telephones light bulbs tools television the piano the internal combustion engine antibiotics the internet paved roads lawn mowers books clocks thermometers the Sistine Chapel Shakespeare's plays soda trains vaccines paper steel airplanes the Constitution elevators recorded music pasteurized milk the ballpoint pen radio zippers nylon cameras movie synthetic material email and pretty much everything else except for alphabet blocks windshield wipers and radioactivity though you might not want to use all three of those at the same time also while you're out there protesting how poorly men have treated you you might want to make some exceptions say for those men who have defended your country's patrolled your streets built your houses cities and highways pulled you out of burning buildings treated your diseases supported your children and faithfully loved you because really when you think about it if men don't love women who do you think will then there's the question of priorities feminists in the West are dealing with such Titanic issues as the fact information box like Siri and Alexa have female voices this is a problem because these box are helpful and knowledgeable which makes them unfeminine since feminists have never helped anyone and don't know anything otherwise they wouldn't be worried about crap like this feminists are also complaining that Syria and Alexa don't protest when you sexually harass them although any guy who gets his kicks by sexually harassing a little plastic box is so pitiful you might want to cut him some slack on the other hand feminists never seemed to protest that women in Muslim countries are routinely flogged stoned and imprisoned for expressing their humanity so you can understand why this might cause some observers to believe that to stay without a woman might actually turn out to be a day without a spoiled fine e entitled feminist girl child and an absurd hat making a fool of herself over nothing in fact I actually said as much to Alexa but she slapped me trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show alright gang without a woman day and maybe tonight if I had a wife live here's that opening but you know we have a lot to talk about today we have a guest in the second half of the show Professor Philip hamburger of Columbia University a law professor who has written a i think a devastating article in this quarters city journal the indispensable city journal about how our rights are being eroded by the deep state by the administrative state but as it's sometimes called really interesting piece and we'll talk to him about it also we got to talk about the the health care repeal and replace Obamacare with Obamacare I think that's listen to cuz it but but you're actually let's step back about on this health care thing okay this this is the the proposal that the GOP has made for how they're going to repeal Obama care what they're going to replace a bit and conservatives are a little concern that it's as as Rand Paul is climate it's Obamacare light and and I want to take a step back because this is only the beginning is going to be all these arguments and you know amendments and changes and then all this stuff and so maybe it's a good thing I think that it gets out in the open and the arguments in the debates begin but the idea is that it's going to repeal let's see it's going to repeal the demand date the requirement that Americans have health coverage or pay a penalty so you won't be paying a penalty and it will even forgive I think backwards the penalty that you would have paid for not having health care in 2016 and it's it's also got keeps it gets rid of the mandate that larger employers provide health insurance to workers and it also repeals most of the taxes that Obamacare imposes and and freezes funding after 20-24 the states that expanded Medicaid under the law so it does do a lot of it does do a lot of good things I mean these are you know these taxes are ridiculously the Medicaid expansion is incredibly expensive but it also it retains the inquirer Minh that insurance cover people with pre-existing conditions which is I keep pointing out is government health care if insurers have to ensure you when you're already sick that's not insurance that's not how insurance works insurance is a gamble that you make with the health company you are gambling that you will get sick and they are gambling that you will stay well long enough for them to collect enough money from from you to pay for your being sick so the idea is that you win either way because if you're well you don't care and if you're sick you get the money so they also has this kind of weird first of all it gives tax credits to people to lower-income people and older people for health care so that's kind of a a that's kind of an entitlement right there and it also creates this kind of backdoor mandate where if you let your insurance lapse and you go back and charges your thirty percent but I want to talk about I want to look at this from a bigger picture because later on we're going to have the Columbia professor come on and talk about the deep state and the way it's roading are right and i want to talk about this the state and the growth of the state because this is what this health care thing is all about okay now one of the reasons that people are always making the jokes that they listen to shapiro show and they get depressed and they listen to me cheer them up that's recent the reason i don't get depressed oddly enough about politics is because i have a tragic view of life that sounds paradoxical but it's not i believe that freedom is a living thing and freedom dies at its best freedom in the past i think has had maybe a 400 year lifespan he usually is closer to 100 or 200 years we're doing pretty well here i think and if you believe that things die every day is a good day right i mean it's just it's just like getting old you know i don't like getting old but I fight it every step of the way but I understand that getting old is better than the alternative which is dying and also like that's really I feel about the government every day that we have freedom is a good day and I think of conservatives like doctors you fighting a losing battle to keep something alive it will ultimately die but every day you win you win and that's then that's why I find myself rather cheerful and things no no so how do I feel I mean what kills freedom ultimately is this desire to make things fair okay and that we understand the desire to make things fair but it ultimately bleeds into equality and equality kills freedom why does equality kill freedom let's say you've got two guys who want to play basketball one of them was LeBron James and one of them is me okay if I want to be equal to LeBron James there's only one way to do it I have to hobble LeBron James right i have to make my bond James worse because I can't be as good as LeBron James because reality nature does not create a quality and people so you say well okay you can't be as good as LeBron James but at least you can have as much money as lebron james as why is it fair that he puts a ball through a hoop and gets to be a gazillionaire and you are witty and brilliant attractive sexually desirable and you're not you know you're just scraping by right so that's that is the problem so I and I agree with that argument so the only way I can do that is I can take LeBrons money and give it to me and why does that get rid of his freedom what because he creates his money through his time and his hard work and his training and his talent and all those things belong to him if they belong to the government why does the government get to say that these belong to us we own your talent we own your time we own your training therefore if we think Clavin deserves the money we can give it to him why does the government have that right it doesn't so a quality is the enemy of freedom always you know we can make things a little bit there we can say that Clavin doesn't have to die gasping in the street because he can't afford you know food maybe LeBron can put in a little bit of money for that maybe you know but still it's LeBrons money he worked for he paid his his his freedom depends on his being able to keep the sweat of his brow and that is why conservatives are always fighting the state you know they're fighting the state because they know you know here's the thing if healthcare were free I would support it if healthcare could be free I would support it if healthcare could be free Ben Shapiro would support it you know sean hannity was where all the conservatives would support we're not we're not mean but it's not free nothing is free somebody has to pay for it and when somebody pays for it his freedom is taken away the state never gives you anything it never gives you anything it only takes things away it trades you freedom it trades you stuff for your freedom for its power your freedom and that's built into the state that doesn't mean that doesn't mean the leftist is necessarily an evildoer he's probably just trying to help he may just be trying to help it's built into the system that equality takes away your freedom everything the government gives you takes away your freedom so the problem the Conservatives have with Obamacare is that that it takes people's freedom away right if you give people health care what do you get well not only are you taking somebody's money to pay for somebody else's health care which is limiting their freedom but you're putting somebody into a system where the state now gets to make choices what if you smoke well should the state be asked to pay for you for it if you get to lung cancer because you smoke didn't you do something wrong didn't you cause your own lung cancer shouldn't be able to prevent you from smoking shouldn't the state be able to say you can't smoke because we have to pay for the lung cancer you get now because liberals love that argument because they want to stop everybody from smoking but they don't love it so much when you start to say well you know illegitimate children cost the state money too because a lot of them end up in jail single-parent homes cost the state money so should the state be able to say when you can have sex with whom you can have sex whether you have to be protected when you have sex I mean this state can make all kinds of decisions once it's got a hold of healthcare healthcare is the holy grail for leftist because it gives them all this power now Obamacare and this is the problem the GOP has Obamacare is an entitlement it's fun but it's unpaid for the idea of Obamacare is everybody is forced to get health care and so the healthy young people are paying for the sick old people right but the healthy young people are saying like that I don't want to do it I don't want to do I don't even care if you put level of penalty on me I'm not going to do it it was built to collapse was built to be unfunded and collapsed because Hillary Clinton was going to be president that Democrats were going to own the Congress forever and when it collapsed they would be there to make it a single-payer system which basically means government health care and then they would have all that power all that control over every decision you make because it would all affect your health and we'd all have to pay for it so they get to say what you do that was the plan honk you know Donald Trump got elected things didn't work out and so now the GOP is stuck with this thing and how do they get rid of it here is the problem with getting rid of it what do we do about the poor nobody wants to say this is right because they're all talking about is making sure everybody has insurance that's that is not the problem if you may if you created a system in which all insurers were competing with all other insurers and people could just get insurance that only cover them in case of the disaster right so I'll pay for my checkups i'll pay for my you know whatever night hearing aid or whatever I need you know I'll pay for some some meds prices drop television sets come out and they cost a million dollars and then within a year that cost you know five hundred dollars because this competition right the prices go down once everybody is buying in that would help happen with health care too except in cases of catastrophic you know care where you need catastrophic care so you get insurance for that that's still still you have the poor so every time Republicans try to fix this system the NBC CBS the Democrat news media you know ABC the New York Times watch what's going to run out find a poor person dying sick coughing up as long as take pictures of it put it on TV and say this is what this Republicans killed this man you know there and this woman this child all these things and and you know we're all nice people we don't want to have that happen we don't want the poor to die because they can't afford healthcare and the big thing the big thing that nobody talks about is people talk about these skyrocketing cost of health care that's not what is happening what is happening is until let's see what is this 2016 until about a hundred years ago health care we didn't have any help here you couldn't do anything maybe 150 years ago doctors used to kill you you know they come over and bleed you you know they come over and do this stuff and they was like magic it was like witch doctor magic until the invention the discovery of antibiotics by men such as we recall from our opening it until the discovery of antibiotics you know they weren't really doing anything now they can help you now they can do amazing things that can keep you alive and get your limbs they can do all this stuff and it all costs money so the question is what is going to happen to the poor and personally I think there's going to have to be an answer to this one of the things about understanding that freedom dies is understanding you have to make little compromises as you go along just like you do when you have when you get all you know like I don't want to concede anything to old age but eventually I stopped doing martial arts because I was going to get catastrophic Lee injured you know you give up little bit during the 30s you know conservatives lost the argument over welfare we started to have a welfare state as all free nations start to have a welfare state and yes is it the beginning of the end yes it is do you have to do it yes you do why because freedom creates wealth and wealth makes people say well you know how come people are dying on the streets when our country is so rich and all this stuff so that is something that happens and then you know you have to fight the growth of welfare but it slowly grows and the same thing is true of health care the only thing i would say before we cut away and bring on our guess the only thing i would say is it it is possible that the GOP should grasp the nettle este station understand that there's going to have to be an entitlement for the poor the poor can no longer go to their families and get the kind of health care that people can get there may have to be a separate bill to deal with this may be trying to deal with it all in this one bill is the big mistake they're making because essentially what this bill does so far is it except the logic of Obamacare that the government has to do something for everybody has to have health care to provide health care for everybody it accepts that logic which is the logic of equality government growth and ultimately the destruction of freedom so let's see what happens I mean this is not the time to panic not the time to run around it is the time to watch the fight the big big thing I'll conclude with this is that Trump is Trump's reputation is riding on this because up till now everything has been executive orders and the Twitter sideshow right this is governing this is when you get on the phone and call it the lawmakers and say what you want from so far has supported this bill but we'll have to see what apps have we got the professor ammonia all right we're gonna have to say goodbye to Facebook in YouTube but come on over to the daily wire calm and got a really interesting interview coming up plus tomorrow is the mailbag day i forgot to say that that I said tomorrow is mailbag get your questions and if you subscribe you can get your
