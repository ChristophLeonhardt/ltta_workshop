>> I GOT A BIG TRUCK, JUST
IN CASE I NEED TO ROUND UP
CRIMINAL ILLEGALS AND TAKE
THEM HOME MYSELF.
YEP, I JUST SAID THAT.
ED: HE JUST SAID THAT AND HE
IS JOINING US NOW, THE
CANDIDATE WHO CALLS HIMSELF
A POLITICALLY INCORRECT
CONSERVATIVE GEORGIA
SECRETARY OF STATE BRIAN
KEMP, GOOD MORNING, SIR.
>> GOOD MORNING, GUYS.
GREAT TO BE ON WITH YOU.
ED: WE SHOULD NOTE THERE ARE
ABOUT SIX CANDIDATES IN THE
PRIMARY AND YOU ARE MAYBE

PEOPLE ARE REALLY RESONATING
TO IT.
IT'S DRIVING THE LEFT CRAZY.

SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY TONGUE IN
CHEEK IN POLITICS ANYMORE.

I WORKED ON THESE PLANS WITH
LOCAL PROSECUTORS, LOCAL LAW

FAMILY SAFE.
I HAVE THREE TEENAGE
DAUGHTERS, A GREAT WIFE
