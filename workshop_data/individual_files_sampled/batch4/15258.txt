I'm Azhar levan it's June 22nd and you're watching battleground oh hi there Ezra Levant I am the rebel commander at the rebel Damini were based here in Toronto Canada but we have viewers around the world we have folks in the United Kingdom folks in the United States we have folks everywhere and that's what makes this live chat so fun every day we do it at 12:00 noon Eastern Time the comments on the right hand side of the screen obviously are free to make but if you want to chip in a few bucks you can do what youtube calls a super chat that costs i think you can get in for $2 and that makes your comment brightly highlighted and I think if you chip in like five dollars that pins it to the top of the little box there for a period of time commensurate with how much dough I've seen people put in 50 bucks and what's great about that is that we actually get a portion of the dough which is sort of a replacement for add money the YouTube has stripped away from conservative sites every day I do a show on a different medium it's not on YouTube it's on our own proprietary player it's a it's a behind a paywall you have to pay eight bucks a month for that if you haven't done that yet it might be something you want to consider but this is free and fun so we make a little bit of dough on the super chat we have a little video clip sometimes web sites that I bring to your attention I've done some terrible impressions this week I apologize for those but Friday's we typically call free for all Fridays which is just really heavy on the comments so I do have some images and vids that I might call upon but I think I'm just gonna do more like a generic call-in show cuz we talked about heavy things all week so let's do that let's do that I'm gonna I'm just gonna start going through the comments I noticed while we were waiting that lauren southern spelt the mail way Lord says that pick is a great a good shot of Ezra's eyebrows looks good looks real you know I'm deeply proud of my eyebrows I'm kidding around I don't think I've ever thought about my eyebrows but and you've made me extremely self-conscious about them now I know of course so can we call up Justin Trudeau's eyebrow melting vis it's so weird there was this press conference that Justin Trudeau did around the g7 I think her memory was right before and it looked like one of his eyebrows was sort of falling off or melting away and it almost looked like he had heard of like stick-on eyebrows and and can we also call up the the clip of that Global TV reporter who took Justin Trudeau up in a plane and asked him about his favorite shampoo do you know what I'm talking about let's get that one also but let me know when you've got the eyebrow clip now I want to let you know I don't actually think he has fake eyebrows I think it was just a lighting and camera angle thing but I don't know here you be the judge play the eyebrow clip there you have it what's going on Prime Minister's left eye yeah I that look that looks weird doesn't it so I thank you for the compliment above my eyebrows let me know when we have a shampoo clip okay I got an email yesterday from someone who said stop beating up Justin Trudeau stop being mean to him stop being mean to Britney Spears um you know what I take your point because we don't want to just be you know gossipy and chatty about eyebrows and things but I would put it to you that there's an enormous deficit of any sort of criticism of Justin Trudeau in this country and the odd time there is a criticism for example once Jason Kenney the United Conservative Party leader of Alberta he said Justin Trudeau was as shallow as a finger bowl and it's not on top of any of his flouse I think we all know that's true but the media party in unison said you apologize young man how dare you be so vigorous and challenging and hurtful in your criticisms they were tone policing the official opposition and Jason can he blinked he bent the knee and he apologized for saying what we all know it's true that Justin Trudeau is shallow so my point to you is can there be one place in all of Canada where we can have a laugh and a chuckle at Justin Trudeau just one place I mean look at all the Trump derangement syndrome wall-to-wall Trump derangement syndrome in the Canadian media can we like take that divide it by a hundred so not be deranged not be crazy just have some fun and be cheeky and and once then I'll talk about eyebrow things yeah I think we can let's keep reading some comments this Oh a super chat just went by let me see that that is from Ezra's first a regular to keep up the good work glad your eyebrows are real they're real and they're amazing thank you same thing once as this episode of a battleground is not showing up on my husband's YouTube account today despite searches just mine why I don't know why and we have had three meetings with YouTube including at the Toronto had headquarters with their head of corporate affairs of public affairs they're of no use or ornament whatsoever just absolutely no help Joe Serrano says hey Ezra greetings from Mexico well greetings from Canada thank you for that and I wonder if you are in Mexico on vacation or if you're based there and I wonder if you have any views on the two-year-old girl who has been made a media star around the world because she was crying because her mom smuggled her into the United States at 11:00 p.m. and you know two-year-olds often cry if they're up that late if they're being arrested by police because their mom was doing something illegal they do often cry that media narrative that she was separated the two-year-old was separated from her mother has been proved false I'm not gonna get too deep into that because that's the subject of my full show tonight but that two-year-old girl who was on the cover of Time magazine to cover the New York Times cover of the New York Daily News the photo was on CBC's national that photo there she was not in fact taken away from her mom in fact she was put with her mom in a family center her mom had been previously deported by Barack Obama in 2013 she is a serial criminal I'm sorry it's against the law to illegally enter the United States what's more and I'm getting into too many details because I'm gonna go heavy on this tonight she has three other children by the way and a husband who's got a good job in Honduras and she basically ran away with the two-year-old girl abandoning her other three kids and him and he was opposed to this and and he said she ran off with their two-year-old yen Ella without even talking to him and he said he's just glad that they're now detained because he says they're safer now than with the coyote human traffickers that's what they're called you know the Canada used to have human traffickers and the Tamils called the snakeheads or something and these are called the Coyotes it's gang so the husband and father said he's glad Trump detained her because she's safe for now he says then when she was with the gang she paid $6,000 to so that's the truth it reminds me so much of Aylan Kurdi we put his image up terrible story Aylan Kurdi a young Kurdish boy terrible tragedy and it was a tragedy but it's also a miracle that a Reuters photographer was right there the moment that he was discovered it I say again it does it was a horrific tragedy whenever a young boy dies but the way this story was weaponized and his body was turned into a human weapon to bash down the doors for mass migration is shocking and they're simply looking to redo that once again as you may know Aylan Kurdi Zandt the wife of the dad so they they weren't fleeing Syria they were already in Turkey they were getting on a boat to go to Europe for free dental care for the dad in fact the aunt gave a press conference to that effect in Canada let's get back to the super chat some of them remark puts my name is Ray in triple parentheses which is sort of a and a an online symbol for Jew yeah it's true Tony naggy says saluting commander Ezra hey Tony Lawrence how the good morning Ezra well good morning and it's just after noon here in Toronto as was first regulars UK representing well thank you you know what I have been in some communication with Tommy's family and his lawyers and we'll be putting out a video probably today or tomorrow with a little bit of news not a lot of news but just a little bit of encouraging news baby steps so I'll have that new site I had hoped to have it ready by now but I just want to make sure it's just right so let me just quickly read a super chat from Keith McIntosh and Hannah did you say we have that pretty ant clip okay yeah well the shampoo clip okay if you can if you can look on YouTube for Aylan Kurdi x' mum ants okay so we'll find that dentist part in there let's read Keith mackintoshes super chatty scissors funny immigration rates are very common in the timeshare trade in Mexico where well-dressed Gringo's sprint out of the back of resorts and try and blend in with the tourists horrible of ice does the same though isn't that interesting I don't quite understand what you mean by that so they're just trying to sneak in and blend in with the tourists and then what maybe you can explain Keith what like what that scammer scheme is I don't quite understand it alright we have a clip this is from Tom Clark you know I was joking about Trudeau's eyebrows I'm not the only one who talks about Trudeau's hair but with the mainstream media I want to show you Tom Clark who used to be the boss of Global News a major like the lead journalist the most senior journalistic global news look at the question he was Tom Clark had this stick he's a pilot so he would go up in his little one propeller airplane with a news makers sitting next to him and they would have little GoPro cameras and he would interview a news maker while they were flying in the plane it's pretty cool it was sort of like um you know that karaoke car stick that James Corden does except it was in a plane and they don't sing it was an injury I thought was a neat idea so you've got Justin Trudeau in the plane you can ask him anything he literally cannot escape he is trapped with you in a tiny plane for at least half an hour let's say maybe an hour I mean that's amazing you could ask him anything and it's all being filmed so if you ask him something embarrassing and Dora got your question he can't wriggle out so what does Canada's leading parliamentary journalists with a very stand Torian voice what question does he put to Justin Trudeau well I'll let you watch for yourself take a look the one that the entire country wants to know what shampoo do you use what a disappointing answer this is going to be whatever happens to be hanging around and at the time if I'm in a hotel it's whatever they give me if it's whatever my wife intends to be using right now I do great for I don't know whatever it is another treated hair or something or otherwise I just drive whatever's there we're gonna turn around that's a pitiful question really really pitiful question and the answer was a little too eager and a little too detailed and uh yeah I don't want to talk about that but I'll I'll talk about that man you see I do use what I have but I bet I'm at home I use my wife's shampoo and it's for color-treated hair because I like to get rid of the gray and I'm not yet at whoa whoa tiger you could have just laughed and instead of saying well I've got a disappointing answer for you it's a little bit long but I'll get it you could have said ha ha that's funny no come on and but I don't know which is lamer but Tom Clark says that's the question the entire country wanted to know or that Justin Trudeau after a little okay I'll answer yeah so that's the media we're faced with up here in Canada all right Thank You Hanna and Justin who have been searching I mean I just throw a little requests at them and I say find this and they got to scour the whole internet and get it but let me let me get back to Alan Kurdi that was a little boy on the beach in Turkey not Syria his family had already fled and we're already safe in Turkey so what was he doing getting on a boat because he was in Turkey Turkey's not a great place I wouldn't want to live there but the career the kriti family was fine they were working and doing stuff why did Alan kirti's dad put him on a boat why was it going on the boat what was he doing well let's ask Alan Curtis and it's the sister of Aylan Kurdi is dad what that whole boat trip was about because like I said they weren't in serious so they're not fleeing Syria they're in Turkey and you don't have to flee anything in Turkey you can just walk out if you don't like it here's the aunt Muhammad in Germany for now yes they sent me by mail they don't have the document Canadian government require I did not do up the last paperwork yet financially I said I don't think we hope that's a story about the situation is Abdullah does not have any teeth has a story about it so I've been trying to help him fix his teeth but it's gonna cost me $14,000 he need his the implant so when I told him there is no way I can get you the money in one time because then test they need to get payment right away and Western Union usually if I send them the money they are only allowed one thousand at the time not under their name of course has to be a third person to collect the money and give it to them so I said to him actually my dad he came up with the idea he said to me I think if they go to Europe for his kids and for better future I think he should do that and then we'll we'll see if we can fix his teeth and that's what I decide the three weeks ago I sent him the money which did you hear that so I mean we had a false start there but then we got right on the teeth thing so that's Aylan Kurdi Zandt that's the sister to Aylan Kurdi s dad so he needed dentures he needed implants and it would cost fourteen thousand dollars I'm skeptical because that's what it probably would cost him in Canada I mean in Turkey I can't imagine implants would cost the same but but let's take her at her word that that aelion's dad needed $14,000 worth of dental and she could only send him a thousand bucks at a time so her dad aelion's grandpa came up with the scheme go to Germany go to Germany to take care of your teeth go to Jay a few weeks ago my dad came up with the idea actually get go to Germany fix your teeth fair that boy was dead because his dad put him on an inflatable raft there was not seaworthy they were going to Germany not to flee persecution they had already fled Syria they were already in Turkey they were going to Germany to get free dental by claiming to be refugees it was a scheme hatched by alien Curtiss grandpa as told by alien kirti's aunt as executed by Aylan Kurdi zone dad that's the boy put the picture of Aylan Kurdi up again that's the boy who was found face down on the beach and just it was just an amazing miracle that Reuters was right there to photograph it and that photograph went viral worldwide this dead boy is dead because his father put him on a unseaworthy raft because his father in concert with the rest of his family to get free dental care and that my friends is a fact I see there's another super chat from Keith McIntosh you said Gringo's working time share without proper documents run the risk of deportation so Mexican equivalent of ice the immigration Customs Enforcement conducts raids on the hotels the gringos in the middle of the presentations have to run out the hotels on the beats now I understand isn't that isn't that funny cheese yeah you know Mexico has extremely strict laws regarding immigration and actually property laws you can't buy if you're a foreigner there are a lot of restrictions on you about where you can buy real estate and how you can own it in Mexico they're very strict a much stricter than Donald Trump super shot from primp Paulo a dead child gets coverage when it suits their narrative dead child in Nice France after terrorist runs people down gets no coverage and no sympathy well it's almost like you are have seen my show tonight already because I do in fact make that exact point with that exact photo maybe we can use it right now Hannah as well that child in Nice France just a reminder a couple years back on the French National Day we're coming up to that next month the beautiful beautiful city of nice shut down their main beachfront street everyone crowded the promenade and they had their celebrations so you had a big long road that was the traffic was stopped and people crowded on it like a fourth of July or a can of the day it was their National Day and the Muslim terrorists got into a 19 ton truck it's not just a little delivery van and it's not even just like a a semi-trailer this is an enormous heavy heavy truck that could pass through anything and he went down this closed off street that was packed with tens of thousands of people and he just mowed like a lawn mower but instead of cutting blades of grass he cut people down dead eighty-six people murdered more than 400 wounded that's like a that's like almost like blowing up an airplane you've killed so many people and injured so many people and they were just scattered on the road but authorities covered up the bodies almost immediately which was appropriate but the media other than one image can we show the image of the of the one child blurred of course and is that ubiquitous is that image everywhere like Aylan Kurdi snow because that's just a Christian kid who was killed by Muslim terrorists that's against the narrative the narrative is these poor migrants we need them to come over that has not being weaponized unlike Aylan Kurdi and this two-year-old en ella in in the united states Keith McIntosh with another super chat the timeshare guys dressed in Tommy Bahama shirts and khaki slats tries to mix in with tourists and bikinis until Mexican ice leaves bottom line Mexico enforces immigration laws just like the u.s. does I absolutely believe it gabriel swift five pounds can you please cover the Marrakech agreement now I want to make sure I understand what you mean by the Marrakesh agreement are you referring to the United Nations global warming conference they're from a couple years ago I have to say that's the only American agreement that I know of the top of my head we did cover it we sent our reporter Sheila Gunn read to cover the Marrakesh conference and it was great coverage I think if you go to rebel UN calm you can see that let me just type that in my computer right now rebel UN dot-com you can see her coverage of the Bonn conference but I'm just scrolling down I'm not sure if we are you can find it on our site Sheila GaN Reid went to Marrakesh for the global warming she did such a good job covering it can we find the clip of her leaning against the the electric car charges I want to show you this clip our Sheila Gunn read applied to go to the Marrakech conference and they tried to keep us out we really leaned on them hard we sent demand letters we had lawyers and fall finally they caved in we were going to Marrakech anyways whether or not they're going to let us in they finally let us in Sheila Gunn Reid was there and she she were there were there were over a thousand reporters there Sheila was the only one who was independent and by that I mean she was the only one there who was not a propagandist and so she covered things like I mean tiny things that if you were alert you would report them because they're interesting for example that none of them recycled their stuff they're just throw the garbage around is that interesting in news were they not really other than these are the preening virtue signalers who in their own conference don't follow their own rules she noted that they sprayed the desert with water twice a day to keep the dust down Marrakech is in Morocco very dusty desert ii place so while they're lecturing you and me on don't waste water there's a drought global warming they're literally spraying the desert twice a day to keep the dust off the delegates fancy shoes but my favorite was when she saw these electric car chargers and you think there's a lot of electric cars in morocco rock there's a poor place electric cars are expensive more than that they're not reliable if you have to you know drive a far distance there's no hot electric car charges in Marrakech but there were there were at the conference and Sheila leaned up against one and well let me just let the video do the talking play the clip you see that what she was trying to make one point that no one was using these electric car chargers it was a big joke you were all in their fancy limos but she accidentally made another point they weren't plugged in they weren't plugged in the electric car chargers at the United Nations global warming conference were fake they were fake she was the only reporter in the entire conference who reported that so they kicked her out of the bond United Nations global warming conference the next year she went anyways and did better reporting from outside the conference of the conference than the thousand hacks inside the conference said all right let me catch up on some super chats that I missed so it I presume that's the Marrakesh conference you're talking about if not let me know I keep McIntosh was in Nice last month and walked the promenade where the massacre occurred amazingly technologically advanced diversity barriers but sadly no memorial I specifically asked that is outrageous and completely unsurprising as we showed you the other day there's no memorial to Lee Rigby as well the British soldier whose head was hacked off by an Isis terrorist in on the streets of London Allen and so what do you think of Michael Savage I'm aware of Michael Savage I just I've not watched his stuff and it's not out of you know and typically or anything I just there's so many people to follow and watch and I just I haven't got into him but sorry I can't say if I'm pro or con I just don't know enough about them keep McIntosh come on you tightwads friday hope you want to make a contribution you think the rabble operates on children's laughter and fairy deaths well thank you very much it does chip in it does make a bit of a difference and we've got a great staff here in Toronto a lot of people who work behind the scenes we have more people who work behind the scenes than who work on camera of course I mean everyone from our web editor to I mean we were big enough that we needed a full-time accountant just for an example we have an office we pay around for we have editors who take the videos from our talent around the world and and edit them so there's a lot of folks who go into it Lulu Bob's chips in five bucks and says I've heard that Fox has been bought by Disney will this change anything for Fox News hopefully coverage will stay fair and balanced out of the corner of my eye bean watching news of that now I don't know what parts of Fox have been bought I'm don't think it's the news part I could be wrong I thought it was sort of the sports and and and entertainment parts but here's the thing about Fox News is it has such a strong brand there's such a strong deaf defined reputation its editorial tone its talent if it were to be changed by any new owner it would immediately lose its appeal to its viewers and it would be like destroying it over if it was dramatic no I mean Fox has shown that it can replace talent I mean megyn kelly left Tucker Carlson came in Bill O'Reilly left so there's they've they've rejuvenated they brought new talent in so I'm not saying that any particular journalist is indispensable but I'm saying if the editorial thesis and tone and trajectory of Fox were ever changed Fox's viewers would say no thanks see you guys later and they would go to an alternative that would probably spring up there are some alternatives now they're not as powerful of course Fox News has been doing this for 20 years it didn't just happen overnight you have online I'll turn those you've got see our TV you've even got the rebel in a small way you've got the one American news Oh a n you've got I'm trying to get news max as a TV I mean there's a lot of attempts out there Fox is so dominant they're so good they're so successful they have big budgets if someone were to tamper with that though that audience money ie audience eyeballs would follow the talent I mean Tucker Carlson is I see Eric it's a balling has left Fox and he's shown up as CRT TV so they would so my point is it would be it would be counterproductive for a new owner to try to change fox news it would just destroy the value of it now maybe there are some insane investors who would say we hate Fox News so much we want to buy it and euthanize it but Disney I think is a publicly traded company if I recall and I don't think that would be in the interests of their shareholders let me catch up I think there's some more Super chats that I've missed Ben sk5 PAP says the Marrakesh agreement involves the EU and Africa made in the last four weeks okay thank you for that clarification so that you weren't talking about the United Nations global warming conference Sarah a year and a half ago thank you for that my whole anecdote about Sheela is therefore irrelevant it sounds like it might be a human trafficking agreement I should confess you that I haven't read it but now you've made me curious so I'll take a look again I might be guessing wrong what's very interesting to me Anna can you call up that French language tweet from marine lepen that I retweeted the other day and translated it's a poll taken in France you could probably find it on marine lepen x' French Twitter account faster than mine a survey of Frenchmen asking them do you think our immigration policy is 2 lakhs and about 61% say yes and then there was a ship called the Aquarius that had hundreds of migrants and it was turned away from Italy by the new Italian government do you support this I think like 64 percent of Frenchmen said yes and then there was a third question that I can't recall by memory and if you get it just feel free to put that up again so my point is I think that here we go thank you so knives that French for a sounding a poll the false they fall say a la politique exact while reading that accent the French and the politics of migration so look at that first question pour les francais la politique me Claude wha a call Lake fir for France is the migration policy to lacks just right or too firm 61 percent say it's to lacks 26% say just right only 13% of Frenchmen say it's too firm next question should France take the Aquarius that's that Italian boat 64 percent say no 35 percent say yes the closing of the Italian ports to humanitarian boats well that's a loaded question right there humanitarian boats yeah I guess that's one way of calling human trafficking but look at that even with that slanted language that bottom one left Falmouth to deport Italian Oh bet though humanitary the closing of the Italian ports to humanitarian boats who would who would say yes to that oh you're against humanitarian boats how about call them human I would just call them boats with migrants on it i but just be neutral despite that spun wording 67 percent of French say doc hole which means I'm in accord with that which means I agree with that only 32 percent say Paco I'm against it that's France for you it's not interesting as a rooster regulars pound 99 keep up the good work after Chad open to all thank you I think I've caught up on on the super chats is that right handed okay let me see maybe I missed one more I read the one from Venice I read the one from Lulu Bob's I might have I think I miss one but my friends will send it to me all right I'm gonna get back to the comments it's Friday we call free-for-all Friday's so we're just gonna go through the comments 1234 let me get through as many as possible Jake writes his free Tommy Robinson well we're working on it we're working on where we have a small role to play we're crowdfunding I've had a little bit of communication with the lawyers I think they're pretty good lawyers and in fact I'll make a proper and very small announcement I'm not a spokesman for the family but I am involved in crowdfunding the lawyers so I'll have a small announcement I'll try and record a video on that today and get that out because just keep you posted VM Parliament chips in five bucks love your show do you ever sleep seems like you tweet 24/7 that is an embarrassing criticism I know you mean it as praise but it's not cool to tweet as much as I do I you know what I it's true and and and you get hooked on it and you think why am i checking Twitter I just went to check Twitter five minutes ago I don't need to see what the absolute up to the second latest is I checked the news five minutes ago I'm sure nothing's happened in five minutes so thank you I know you mean that as a compliment but it is terrible that I tweet so much Lauren Southern's felt the masculine way Ezra why are they bringing in migrants from warm climates and then talking about climate change in carbon emissions yes doesn't make a lot of sense doesn't luau me says Quran is a war manual it is it is it is very thing it's a book of laws no Hammonds law it's a book of history or revisionist history if you read the Koran you'll see there's a fellow named Issa you might know him as Jesus there's a gal named Miriam that's Mary there's Jakub and all sorts of characters from the Old Testament in the New Testament and you won't quite recognize them in the book because they do things differently than in the Christian and Jewish Bible there's Musa that's Moses Ibrahim that's Abraham so there's a lot of revisionist history listen that's their holy book they it was the the last of the three monotheistic religions the Jews were first with their Torah the Christians with the New Testament and Islam presents itself as having perfected those religions and yeah but it is a document of war it tells the stories of war and and exhort store and has lots of rules for war including the rule that you can take conquered women as your rape slaves that is in the Koran and that is why Isis does it Isis doesn't rape women just because they're rapey they are rapey because it is in their holy book that if you capture an infidel woman you may rape her as a prize just the same way you can steal you know chattels and property and money in war you can steal women and make them your rape slaves I don't know if you're some actually haven't posted it yet but I did an interview with Robert Spencer about his new book the history of jihad and we talked about did you know yeah I didn't know this until just a few days ago Baltimore if I say Baltimore what do you think well if you're like me you think Baltimore Maryland writes big city it's not too far away from Washington DC it's been in the news with the you know the black lives matter movement Baltimore there's a place in Ireland called Baltimore I didn't know I didn't know I'm sure if I was from Maryland I would have known but I'm a Canadian I didn't know did you know that when Islam was ascendance before they would have slave raids on the British Isles and to Ireland and there was a slave raid a Muslim raid in Baltimore Ireland that took almost the whole town they went and they grabbed those freckle a redheaded Irishman and took him away the man worked his slaves the women were raped as rapists later they were kept as raped concubines Muslim Raiders came to the United Kingdom and to Ireland with a systemic kidnapping for rape slavery that's a fact I didn't know that I didn't know that I with Robert Spencer about his new book which covers that situation what do you think of that let me keep going Michael phases gotta Gaza Freedom Flotilla well I agree with you if you mean freedom from the terrorist dictatorship under which Gaza struggles Gaza has no Israeli soldiers there used to be a few thousand Jews who lived there they were forcibly removed by Ariel Sharon the Prime Minister of Israel at the time Gaza is not free it's a theocracy run by a terrorist group it's a military base camp for terrorist attacks on Israel so yeah I believe in freeing Gaza - I don't want to hand them over to Fatah the PLO they're not much better than Hamas that runs Gaza real men fish rest in peace Charles Krauthammer you will be severely missed you are so right you know I had the pleasure of interviewing him a couple of times so smart such a I mean I had he was so thoughtfully and his columns were so sharp you know what he had a book of collected columns and he came on he interviewed let me interview him but but he had a strict rule with Fox that he couldn't be a pundit on other TV channels but the one exception to that rule was when he had a book he was allowed under his contract with Fox to do the circuit promoting the book so that's the only way guys like me who weren't with Fox could talk to him it's a good rule for Fox Fox really helped build up Charles Krauthammer he was there sort of designated a smart guy everyone else wanted to talk to crowd everybody had to say no except for when he did books did you know that his book of columns so this wasn't even new stuff this was a columns that have been out there can you imagine a collection of past columns sold more than 1 million copies of that book staggering that shows how big a connection he had with his readers I found that I can't even believe that to this day the just a compilation of old columns a million sales that's a book um let me keep reading RAM Cooper 57 been watching the conservative independent youtubers growing in a very fast rate in recent months well I'm gonna politely disagree with you maybe you're observing something that I am NOT but in January February of 2017 YouTube basically put a muzzle or a muffler on conservative youtubers D monetizing on mass taking them out of advertising buying pools shadow banning them restricting them I mean even today people say that they were not given information about you know they weren't given an alert about this live chat we you know I our revenues were cut by eighty five percent in a single month our traffic was the same our revenues were reduced by eighty five percent I told you before that I meant with the YouTube bosses here in Toronto and they they didn't deny they said that's just how it is they don't care they like the rest of Silicon Valley are at war with conservative opinion ators that's why so many people have to remain it that's why Infowars makes their money from selling you know supplements that's why people like Jordan Peterson and Dave Rubin make their money through patreon because YouTube has D monetized conservatives they've killed them off or try to I mean we've managed to survive by hook and by crook through crowdfunding and whatnot but so I'm a skeptic of what you said prim Paulo ate chips in five bucks thank you it says another great book by Robert Spencer the truth about Mohammed Olli Larson I think that's DKK that is that Danish kroner or something I'm not sure I keep on rolling all right will do I have been to Denmark I've met I've met a number of people there who are concerned about a sonification I went to Copenhagen and I went right across the water to Malmo to see what a 50% Muslim city looks like in Europe in the 21st century uh Alan Ansel says what do you think about Trump's spaceforce I just saw the headline I didn't read the details I think it makes sense to have a space for us I think China will be there if America is not and I don't like the idea of China being dominant in space so I guess based on the headline alone I would support it Craig McDonald what is your take on the Trudeau government pushing through the current equalization formula for another five years I've already gets the shaft again when in the next meeting of the producers Club here in Alberta okay some great questions there yeah it was sneaky it was ramming that through quickly just shows that the Liberals have written off the West Alberta in particular they don't care that pipeline transparent that will not be built it's just not going to be I mean they're not even pretending it will they bought the underlying existing 70 year old Kinder Morgan trans mountain pipeline there was no problem with that it's working you know hunky-dory four point five billion dollars they overpaid by a billion by the way there's no plan there's no way to get the other seven point four billion to make the pipe expanded which was the whole project here and money was never the problem Kinder Morgan had money just like energy East had the money and the Northern Gateway had the money the problem is political so yeah Trudeau doesn't like the West one bit next meeting the producers Club in Alberta we should do one again I know we did one I'm trying to remember the month we had a breakfast lunch and and dinner we did breakfast in Calgary at Phil's on Glenmore and elbow and then we had lunch in Red Deer that hotel right off Gates Avenue and then we had a dinner event not in a mansion proper but it was at the Legion and I think it was leduc and I was there I spent the day with Sheila in both those three cities so we did some fun events in Alberta but yeah we should get back out there oh I should say that we did we did have an event in Calgary we we had the rolled out our films save the Christians we didn't do that in eminence so Craig I can't remember what city are from forgive me but yeah we should get back out there and do more stuff I like those events Susan zomer a regular comment not a super Chad says the pipeline will be built by the Brotherhood that's why work permits bring in through the jihadist no I don't I don't think that's the answer you know can I tell you something Hannah can you last night I I did a tweet a tweeted a Fox News video of a steel mill in Ohio and Texas that announced a 500 million dollar expansion and it's a clip they interview the c.e.o and he's just so excited imagine putting a half a billion dollars into a steel mill in America like you go back in time two years before Donald Trump was president people say you're in the you think it's steel mill in America are you crazy you don't you know you don't do that anymore don't you know you shut down steel mills in America and if you're gonna build a steel mill you build it in China don't you know that's how you do it like I mean really you're putting half a billion into a steel mill in America you create it's called the Rust Belt for a reason how things change and yeah this guy was so excited this owner of the steel mill and he went on fox and he said the tax cuts and Donald Trump helping level playing field half a billion and then after he he talked the host said and the steel mill should be operational in not I want to give away the answer how long it takes in Canada applications for big industrial projects in the billion dollar range can take years Kinder Morgan I think made their first application in 2013 I'm going from memory I think there were five years there Keystone Excel pipeline application I think was in 2009 it still hasn't been built the Keystone Excel so it's nine years any luck finding that clip it was a YouTube clip on fox business all right I'll I'll take you out of suspense I'll tell you my friends I I feel these obscure requests and my friends and say quick give me I'll tell you because I couldn't believe it okay so it's June its June 22nd today and here's the CEO who just said I'm building a new steel blast furnace thing whatever for half a billion dollars and you know when it's going to be operational in September of this year yeah that's what it's like if you're in a pro industry pro development jurisdiction and this CEO was so excited it was almost he was almost hopping up and down in the chair if we find it I'll show to you but I gave you the punch line the punch line is from announcement to completion July August September with 90 days oh and he's hiring and you I don't know if we have equipment it's hiring a thousand men to build this thing so you're taking the thousand and this and the one he's got two locations once in Texas ones in Ohio in Ohio it's in like a little town or a medium-sized town of like 30,000 and there's gonna be hundreds of permanent jobs amazing amazing but I don't know if you saw industrial confidence in America is it like 95% the highest ever recorded and it's true it's true you know you know one thing about Trump when he says by American hire American he means it and if you doubt how serious he is look at him fight with China and even with Canada anyone who's not gonna open the gates to American products he's gonna fight hard alright let me uh haven't missed any super chance as his first two regulars estra needs an embedded space force correspondent well there'd be a lot of jokes they're just really obvious jokes about being a space cadet oh yeah that's just let's just bang through a few more regular chats if you make a super chat I'll be sure to read it um synth works people take opiates as painkillers even they are not in pain it's a big it's a big issue opiates it's a huge issue in Canada too not just in the States killer Kane Sarah how do you make a green economy drive away the industry and jobs borrow until you broke to invest in green tech then wait for the world temperature to drop yeah it doesn't make any sense it just doesn't make a this I saw headline today Rachel Notley the socialist premier of Alberta was tweeting something about oh now the Doug Ford is the Premier of Ontario he's gonna drive away investment in green tech drive its Alberta yeah an investment sister that ain't investment when the government takes tax dollars to give out and subsidies and grants and crony capitalists lobbying gifts Aspen you can call an investment that's that's corrupt corporate welfare so yeah yeah there's no real investment in which I mean I've seen wind turbines from California to Alberta to Hawaii to shinjang China and what do they have in common I'll tell you when the subsidies end which they always do the wind turbines immediately fall into disrepair why because there's no because they are constantly an economic negative the only reason to build a wind turbine is for a subsidy or for a PR or political purpose a wind turbine for which the subsidy is removed will immediately be fall into disuse will be disconnected etc it does not even pay for itself on an ongoing basis you know whenever I see wind turbines I I take out my cellphone and try and film them because I always I always tell always like to show people look at this 80% of them are broken not even not turning they're broken I've seen them in Germany - oh my god they're ugly in Germany I think the ugliest is in the UK I mean that what they're doing to that countryside it really the UK the countryside of the UK really is beautiful I mean what did Shakespeare call it this happy land described I'm not going to try and go from memory about Shakespeare but did he call it this land this England yeah I'm gonna read it to you because it's so pretty this blessed plot this earth this realm this England can I can I read it to you give me a minute this is from King Richard the second act to sing one and I'm not just talking about the desecration and defacement of the British countryside by these enormous wind turbines and I think it was James deling pole or Lord Monckton two great Brits who put the idea in my mind that they're really religious symbols they're three armed crosses not not a regular cross they're religious symbols of pagan environmentalism replacing Christianity their horrific let me read Shakespeare four hundred years ago this royal throne of Kings the sceptered Isle isn't that pretty this earth of majesty the seat of Mars this other Eden deme paradise this fortress built by nature for herself against infection in the hand of war this happy breed of man this little world this precious stone set in the silver sea which serves it in the office of a wall or as a moat defensive to a house against the envy of less happier lands this blessed plot this earth this realm this England oh isn't that nice and isn't that the truth about the English Channel aim like a moat defensive to a house against the envy of less happy air lands and at the truth and the European Union and the mass migration the Brits walk back brexit was about getting back to this am i right am i right how can that but is that Britain still alive I don't know I don't know I wish it were did you say we had any video were you guys signaling to me we already know all right let's see if I can read some more see if I can read some more gotta love El Chupacabra Ross has gotta love Fridays since work says Land of Hope and Glory yeah there's some great great great songs you know it's just that hey Justin can you google the minstrel boy to war has gone from you know this is I was just telling my friend Justin the other day I'll find it about a great movie we you know what we played that Michael Caine impression the other day Michael Caine impress is great did you like Michael Caine he was in the movie with Sean Connery on above 30 years ago and it was called the the man who would be king based on the story by Rudyard Kipling of a couple of Brits swashbuckling British soldiers in India in the 19th century who go and find this undiscovered Little Kingdom the last contact they had with outsiders was Alexander the Great and as you can tell in the name the man who would be king so these two Brits and they had some guns with them conquer this area and install Sean Connery is the king and they call him son of secunda sort of the the son of Alexander because he had some symbol of some Mason symbol and it was just great can we get the song the minstrel boy I'm gonna see if I can find that I'm not you know what that's a tough thing to find in about a second but if you love British stuff if you love Britta Britain at its peak at its prime if you love the British Empire there's a song called the minstrel boy and it was sung by the two of them in that movie the man who would be king and I'm gonna stop there because there's no way I'm gonna find that in time to show you and I don't want to make you wait while I google it but maybe we'll have it another day oh you know what speaking of Kipling there's he's got these a you know every remembrance day I read a poem by Kipling called Tommy Atkins about how poorly we all treat soldiers 364 days a year and then one day a year we pretend to care and it was written over a hundred years ago and it was true then I want to I want to play for you can I play for you a video that I think I can find quickly it's also it shows Kipling's form of multiculturalism Kipling made a poem called the white man's burden that sounds super duper racist doesn't it or you got the minstrel boy okay I'll call it for that in one second we might go a couple minutes long today because I want to show you a Gunga Din and I want to show you a minstrel boy give me a minute of the minstrel boy Justin so this Michael Caine you know what they actually sing the song twice in the movie the first time I think they're in a cave in on like the Himalayas or something but again I'm going from a 20 year memory I remember yesterday about the wedding crashers wasn't that accurate but you get a feeling in the flavor there those two Brits sort of conquer this this crazy world you got to see that movie it's called the man who would be king written by Kipling Kipling I think he was born in India so he had a deep appreciation for things Indian he wrote The Jungle Book so a kala and well you know Bagheera and kha these are all Indian words hindi I presume so he wrote these stories about the jungle and left the tires Shere Khan and he loved Britain he loved the British Empire he loved India he loved colonizing but to liberate and lift up he wrote a poem called the white man's burden he basically said we have to help the world it's our burden to lift the world now you would say that's very very very very racist and it may be racist in a technical way but if he read the poem he's saying it is our job let us let us liberate and pacify and bureaucratize and maybe eventually democratize and and I think he's the best poem poet since Shakespeare frankly and I want to send you oh my god it's one o'clock I want it I want to extend this by two minutes you guys I'm gonna send you a link to someone reading a poem called Gunga Din what is Gunga Din what is a word even mean we're going five minutes late guys we're good we're stretching this for five minutes Gunga Din was the name of some local ethnic Indian helper outer to the British soldiers and I want to show you this because it starts off a little bit racist but then he says you're a better man than I Gunga Din can we play did you get my email there you guys get this is just some dramatic actor doing a reading of Kipling's Gunga Din so again Gunga Din is the name of some local Indian helper outer to indigenous British stock white soldiers in India and I know it's 101 already I want to go for probably two minutes this is just some guy but I've seen this and it's so powerful it gives me the chills run the Gunga Din Ganga did you may talk of gin and beer when you're cornered safe out here and you're sent a penny fight and older shot it but if it comes to slaughter you will do your work on water and your lick the bloody boots Aviles got it now in India sunny clime where I used to spend my time at Sullivan liver Majesty the Queen I'm all then blackface crew the finest man on earth was our regimental bhisti Gunder Dean it was de de de you live in lumber brick dust under ding Cynthiana Rio whoa get it para Nene Oh yo squidgy knows how the hide all done again the uniform he wore it was nothing much before and rather less than half of that behind for a piece of twisty rag and a goatskin water bag was all the field equipment he could find when the sweating troop train lay in a siding through the day where the heat would make your broom and eyebrows crawl we shouted hurry by till our throats were bricky dry then we walked him he doesn't service all it was d-day you even wear the mr. fab you bein you put some Jody and it or I'll marry you this minute if you don't feel that now y'all mates younger days he would dock and carry one is the longest day was done I need to receiver know the you Sofia if we charged or broke or cut you can bet your bloomin not it be waiting in fifty paces right Frank right flank Bria released mastic on his back he would skip with our attack and he'd watch us till the bugles main retire and for all his dirty ID he was white clear white inside when he went to tender wounded under fire it was date day game with a bullets kicking dust spots on the green when the cartridges rang out usually in the front file shout and your Nishal mules and ghandar day and i shall forget the night when I drop behind a fight with a bullet when the belt plates should it be strokin mad with first and the men who spied me first was of good old greedy grunting gang good day he lifted iron and he plugged me where I bled and he got me half a pint of water green oh it was crawling on his dunk but of all the drinks I've drunk gratefulness to learn from the gun good day hey here's a fella with a bullet through his spleen he's drawing up the ground and he's taking or a rapper go suck a water canteen well he carried me away to where a dually lay and a blue account so that they could clean he called me sighs inside and just before he died I hope seemed absolutely somehow army him later on in the place where he's gone where it's always double drilled and no canteen he'll be squatting on the coals giving drinks to poor dancers I'll get a swig you know from younger day yeah dead so I belted you and flayed you by the Living God that made you you're a better man than I you think of that what do you think of that did you understand it there's that one line he's white inside is that something remember when this was written hundred years ago I think that is a praise the highest praise imaginable in a different era that's Rudyard Kipling saying these men in India that we disparage and shout at while you heard the last line you're a better man than me Gunga Din that's Britain that's Britain folks it's 1:06 we went on far too long thanks for watching
