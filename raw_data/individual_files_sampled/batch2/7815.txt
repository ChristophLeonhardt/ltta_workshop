screaming our lives matter it's a protest - my protest what kind of that to anyone who ever responded to black lives matter with all lives matter let's talk about it let's talk about it you see I want to check in on your stance when black lives matter took to the streets to protest the unlawful killing of black people a counter protest ensued those counter protesters were people who just took issue with the idea that the treatment of black lives by the justice system had come under scrutiny and so took the protests as a personal attack on them which is why they chose to protest the protest but while black lives matter have continued to vocalize their outrage and again they took to the streets this past weekend to protest the murder of both on zone and the despicable attempts to smear his character there were no counter protesters which left me curious do you still believe all lives matter do you believe that Bothans life matter do you think that both of his life would have been lost his character smiled and his death tied to marijuana if he was white because these are the questions you should be asking yourself if in fact you do still believe that all lives matter and I asked because the only time I hear all lives matter come up in conversation is in response to someone saying black lives matter all lives matter I've never seen all lives matter signs at any of the marches to insist the Trump administration keep families together you know I would have assumed all lives would have included children being inhumanely separated from their mothers and fathers nor when I think about it did I see any all lives matter activists speaking out against Trump's efforts to deny the lives lost after Hurricane Maria I mean the word all is so broad I would assume it included the residents of Puerto Rico many of whom are still currently living amidst destruction don't you feel that Puerto Ricans as US citizens could benefit from your voice the same way you lend it to a conversation whenever black lives matter dare speak out but no we have not heard from you while those who said black lives matter also said keep families together help Puerto Rico March for our lives and fight for 15 you said nothing which leads me to believe that when you said all lives matter you really didn't mean it what you meant was I refuse to acknowledge that black lives are treated differently in America so I will do everything I can to distort the message and the flag wow that sounds so familiar but I don't hate America these people hate America well maybe black lives matter were actually disrespecting the military I mean am I wrong here I'm open to anyone who can come over and tell me different because you want to know what I believe wholeheartedly that those who actually said all lives matter are the biggest calt in America and now your silence speaks volumes because when you said all lives matter what you really meant was black lives don't matter and the current predicament in Dallas actually and sadly validates that point the sad fact is that too many Americans black lives simply don't matter and off-duty police officer walked into a black man's apartment and killed him in the comfort of his own home and instead of thoroughly investigating the officer Dallas PD quickly booked her and let her out on bail just an hour after committing this atrocity which by the way is 23 hours earlier than those who were arrested for peacefully protesting her crime her victim's apartment was scalped so that police could blast out to social media that they found marijuana yet she was allowed to move out of her apartment without it being searched meanwhile the victim a god-loving righteous Christian man has had his character smeared by the very same Dallas PD and many in the media but his life like those in Puerto Rico or those separated at the border doesn't matter to those who said all lives matter because all those matter always had an asterisk at the bottom all lives matter restrictions may apply or maybe just maybe this sign was just a modern-day version of this side come up on my instagram at francis m maximum into write they are if you want to become a member to buy tea network.com sliced join never miss another breakdown video by ringing the bell below you'll get notified whenever we publish something new and don't forget to join TYT today download our 280 plus app on your phone or head over to tea y-t-dot-com slash join
