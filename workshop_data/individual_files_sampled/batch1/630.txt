one of the smallest countries in the world is about to host a summit that could very well be the biggest diplomatic event in decades u.s. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim jong-un are due to meet at last and potentially defuse one of the world's most dangerous flash points because of the dramatic back-and-forth mystery over the location and the personalities involved the summit is engaging people who previously had scant interest in geopolitics Singapore has a history of hosting top-level high security events including two critical Taiwan Chinese meetings and the annual shangri-la security and defense summit the whole security apparatus is very robust there's a lot of surveillance around the island there's significant control of dissent there's control of the media such that any events that may be deemed unhappy unhelpful can be quite tightly controlled and put down Trump meets Kim is a big story in Japan the meheeco takata's Network has had teams in Singapore since it was first named as the summit venue a great deal of the time playing cat-and-mouse with the North Korean delegation Singapore Duke we have covered news in Singapore a lot before this time though the security is stricter and more difficult for us to work the police presence is heavy underlying the interest and excitement for the summit Singapore newspaper The Straits Times conducted a readers poll asking Singaporeans where they felt the summit would take place most out it would be at one of the large hotels here that can be locked down for security Singapore will reportedly pay some of the expenses of the North Korean delegation people here are proud to host the summit but maybe not to pay for some of it we are neutral we just makes it a great place for two countries that are posing to me but I don't think we have to pay for anything doing a Singapore is good for us because thing about being a smaller the country but we are able to host such a big event it's good for us the government says summit preparations are moving forward smoothly but with an intricate maze of protocol to navigate from the proper amount of doors and meeting rooms to making the delegations from one of the richest nations in the world appear equal to one of the poorest Singapore certainly has a tough eight days ahead a task they say that was happily taken on Scott hi there al Jazeera Singapore
