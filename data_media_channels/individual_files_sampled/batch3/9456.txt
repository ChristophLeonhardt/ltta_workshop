Hannity: ED HENRY JOINING US NOW WITH A REACTION, THE AUTHOR OF "THE NEW YORK TIMES" BEST SELLER, TRUMPS AMERICA, THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR NATION. FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, NEWT GINGRICH. AND EVERY CASE, TONIGHT WAS GLARING IN THIS CLIENT OF HIS. NO COOPERATION FROM THE VERY PEOPLE THAT THEY SAID WOULD COOPERATE. YES. I WILL TAKE YOU UP FROM 30 SECONDS AWAY FROM THIS. ALL OF US SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE LAST 24 HOURS PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE ONE WITH AN ENORMOUS VICTORY WITH CANADA AND MEXICO. IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THIS NOISE. BIG THINGS ARE HAPPENING TO CREATE A LOT OF NEW JOBS, TO KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING. THE PRESIDENT IS DELIVERING AND HE IS GETTING RESULTS. Hannity: IT IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT. THIS TO ME AS A REAL THREAT. ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES WE SHARE, ALL OF US. THIS IS WHY I SAY DOES NOT REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT. HERE'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND COME I HAVEN'T HAD THIS IN A LONG TIME. THEY TALK ABOUT THIS DEAL THAT HE MADE COMPANY GIVE UP NOTHING. REPUBLICAN SOMETIMES HAVE THIS PASSION FOR BEING STUPID. FLAKE GOT NOTHING OUT OF THAT, NOTHING. PLAYS THIS GAME. LET ME SEE I CAN RIP YOU OFF AGAIN. DIDN'T HE SAYS, WOULD YOU PLEASE RIP ME OFF A LITTLE BIT MORE? THERE IS A REASON PEOPLE GET FED UP WITH THE STUFF. LINDSEY GRAHAM WE HAD AN A WHILE AGO IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE GUY ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. HE TOLD THE TRUTH. I THINK WE AS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE TO STAND UP AND SAY THEY DON'T WANT A COUNTRY THAT IS DOMINATED BY THESE KINDS OF PEOPLE. I THINK IT HAS A REALLY SERIOUS THREAT. Hannity: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF HIS IDEA THAT IF THEY FALL SHORT, THE SHOULD BE A ELECTION AGAIN QUESTION WORK ON THIS ISSUE? I THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA. Hannity: AND THE PRESIDENT WOULD RENOMINATE? Tucker: I THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA. THE ALABAMA SENATOR WHO SUPPOSEDLY NOT A LIBERAL DOES COME OUT TO WORK WITH THE LEFT, JO DONNELLY REPRESENTED THE VICE PRESIDENT'S HOME STATE, WHO WILL VOTE WITH THE LEFT. YOU HAVE HIGH CAMP IN THE STATE WHICH REPUBLICANS HAVE CARRIED A 16 OUT OF THE LAST 17 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS. THEY WILL PROBABLY WOOD FOR THE LEFT. WE HAVE 15 OUT OF 17. I THINK IMAGINE IS GOING TO VOTE FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH. I TELL YOU WHAT, IF HE DOESN'T VOTE FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH, THEY ARE DEFINITELY SHOULD BRING BRETT KAVANAUGH BACK UP BECAUSE AFTER THE ELECTION, MANSION WILL HAVE DISAPPEARED. Hannity: ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE GOTTEN TO USE TO, I WARN MY AUDIENCE EVERY TWO OR THREE YEARS. RACIST, SEXIST, HOMOPHOBES, ISLAM HOPES, KILLED CHILDREN AND KILLED GRANDMA. I WATCHED YOU GO THROUGH THIS. I WAS THERE. I SAW IT ALL. THERE IS A CERTAIN EMBRACING OF SLANDER NOW. IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHOSE FAMILY IS HEARING THIS. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY ARE SAYING. THEY SCORE POINTS WITH THEIR CRAZED FRENCH THAT IS PEOPLE ARE SAYING. THIS ELECTION IS FALL IS ABOUT TWO AMERICAS. IN AMERICA THAT THINKS BULLYING YOU AT A RESTAURANT, PULLING YOU IN AN ELEVATOR, HARASSING YOU, DESTROYING YOU, SMEARING YOU, SHAMING YOU IN FRONT OF YOUR CHILDREN IS FINE BECAUSE THEY ARE MORALLY IMPURE. Hannity: I NEVER HEAR A SINGLE POSITIVE AGENDA ITEM THAT IS GOING TO BENEFIT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM THE DEMOCRATS. THIS IS WHAT I HEAR, THEY WANT TO IMPEACH TRUMP THEY WANT AND BLISS INVESTIGATIONS, THEY WANT TO KEEP OBAMACARE WHICH IS BEEN A DISASTER. THEY WANT TO GET RID OF I.C.E AND OPEN BORDERS. THEY WANT THE CRUMBS BACK. THEY WANT THE TAX CUTS BACK. THEY WANT THEM BACK. HOW DO REPUBLICANS DEFEAT HISTORY AND THEY SAID THAT IT IS ONLY HAPPEN THROUGH TABS IN THE LAST 100 YEARS. THE PARTY GETS THE POWER OF THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THEN HOLD ONTO POWER AND THE MIDTERMS. THE SAME WAY WE WANTED 2016. WE GET MORE VOTES WHERE IT MATTERS. THE FACT IS, I WILL GO OUT ON A LIMB, I THINK ELECTION NIGHT THIS YEAR WILL BE WORSE THAN 2016. I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A SHOCK. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR EXAMPLE, CAN REDUCE THE CANDIDATE FOR CALIFORNIA WANTS TO HAVE GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTH CARE TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. Hannity: 10 MILLION. THAT IS THIS YEAR. WHEN WORKERS GO TO CALIFORNIA, AND EVERY PERSON GET SICK ON THE PLANET WILL BE TOLD TO GO TO CALIFORNIA APPEAR THEY WANT TO TAKE CARE OF YOU. I THINK THOSE KINDS OF POLICIES Hannity: BY THE WAY Hannity: BY THE WA, Hannity: BY THE WAT Hannity: BY THE WAE Hannity: BY THE WAM Hannity: BY THE WAS Hannity: BY THE WAT Hannity: BY THE WAI Hannity: BY THE WAP Hannity: BY THE WAR Hannity: BY THE WAA ARE SO UNSUSTAINABLE. Hannity: BY THE WAT INDICATOR IS THAT WE WANT A SEAT IN SOUTH TEXAS. 53% HISPANIC IN IN A MOMENT T WE HAVE NOT HAD IT 139 YEARS, 53% HISPANIC IN IN A MOMENT O LIMIT THE DEMOCRATS FAVOR TAX. ABORTIONS, THEY JUST LEFT. THEY SAID WE ARE NOT WITH YOU. Hannity: IF THIS DOESN'T AWAKEN THE PACE OF THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, TRUMP SUPPORTERS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL. I DIFFERENT SAY TO ME TODAY, THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN AS MANY CONSERVATIVES AS ANGRY AS THEY ARE NOW. IT IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BRETT KAVANAUGH AND YOU LOOK AT HIS TWO DAUGHTERS AND HIS WIFE AND YOU THINK, THESE BAD HUMAN BEINGS. THEY ARE WILLING TO DO THIS TO THIS FAMILY. Hannity: WITHOUT ANY COOPERATION AT ALL. IT IS SCARY.
