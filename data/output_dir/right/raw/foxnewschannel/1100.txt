HEATHER: RED RIPTIDE THREATENING

4
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:25,299
THE HOPES OF THE DEMOCRATIC.

00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:25,800
WAVE IN NOVEMBER.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,467

15
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:38,245
A RED RIPTIDE OR BLUE WAVE.

16
00:00:38,245 --> 00:00:39,413
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO

17
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:39,747
HAPPEN?

18
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:40,481
>> STARTING IN CALIFORNIA WE HAD

19
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:41,982
A LOT OF WARNINGS FROM DEMOCRATS

20
00:00:41,982 --> 00:00:51,759
THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A

21
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,393
BLUE WAVE THAT SWAMPED US.

22
00:00:52,393 --> 00:00:53,093
WE HAVE 7 CONGRESSIONAL RACES

23
00:00:53,093 --> 00:00:53,794
HERE IN DISTRICT THAT HILLARY

24
00:00:53,794 --> 00:00:54,495
CLINTON CARRIED AND DEMOCRATS

25
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:55,229
AND NANCY PELOSI TARGETING AND

26
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:58,599
HOPING FOR THOSE TO GO THEIR WAY

27
00:00:58,599 --> 00:00:59,133
AND THEY WENT BUST.

28
00:00:59,133 --> 00:00:59,767
REPUBLICANS DID VERY WELL.

29
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:02,403
OUR VOTERS TURNED OUT IN GREATER

30
00:01:02,403 --> 00:01:07,475
NUMBERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THEN

31
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:07,908
DEMOCRATS DID.

32
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:08,642
THAT CARRIED OUT IN OTHER STATES

33
00:01:08,642 --> 00:01:08,976
AS WELL.

34
00:01:08,976 --> 00:01:15,483
WE HAD HIGH ENTHUSIASM AMONG

35
00:01:15,483 --> 00:01:16,217
REPUBLICANS COUPLED WITH AFTER

36
00:01:16,217 --> 00:01:16,851
MANY MONTHS OF DEMOCRATS

37
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:17,585
COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT

38
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:19,520
BUT NOT HAVING THEIR OWN AGENDA

39
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,221
THEIR VOTERS DIDN'T TURN OUT.

40
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:20,988
IT IS LOOKING GOOD FOR US.

41
00:01:20,988 --> 00:01:24,592
>> IF YOU LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE

42
00:01:24,592 --> 00:01:31,198
CALL THE MAIN NEWS STREAM MEDIA,

43
00:01:31,198 --> 00:01:31,799
THEY TALKED A LOT ABOUT

44
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:39,240
DEMOCRATS TURNING OUT IN HUGE

45
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,573
NUMBERS.

46
00:01:39,573 --> 00:01:40,307
DO YOU THINK THIS WILL KEEP UP

47
00:01:40,307 --> 00:01:40,975
WITH REPUBLICANS AS WE HEAD

48
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:41,509
TOWARD THE MIDTERMS?

49
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,243
MORE REPUBLICANS HEADING OUT AND

50
00:01:42,243 --> 00:01:42,810
WHY DO YOU THINK MORE

51
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,544
REPUBLICANS ARE HEADING TO THE

52
00:01:43,544 --> 00:01:44,311
POLLS?

53
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:49,316
>> IT IS SPECIFIC, DEPENDS ON

54
00:01:49,316 --> 00:01:49,683
THE STATE.

55
00:01:49,683 --> 00:01:50,417
IN BLUE STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA,

56
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:52,052
WHICH IS THE MOST EXTREME,

57
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:52,720
REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENT

58
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,259
VOTERS AND DEMOCRATS ARE TIRED

59
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:58,993
OF THE HIGH TAXES AND GOVERNMENT

60
00:01:58,993 --> 00:01:59,727
CONTROL, REGULATIONS THAT MAKE

61
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:00,895
IT HARD FOR BUSINESSES AND

62
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:06,367
FAMILIES TO SUCCEED, YOU ARE

63
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:07,067
SEEING THE EFFECT OF THAT, IN

64
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:07,801
OTHER STATES AND SEEING WHAT THE

65
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:09,203
PRESIDENT IS DOING NATIONALLY TO

66
00:02:09,203 --> 00:02:10,638
HELP US OUT, ENTHUSIASTIC TO

67
00:02:10,638 --> 00:02:16,010
CARRY THAT ON.

68
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,677
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN A VERY

69
00:02:16,677 --> 00:02:18,646
NEGATIVE AGENDA THEY HAVE BEEN

70
00:02:18,646 --> 00:02:19,313
PROPOSING AND NOT PROPOSING

71
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:26,086
SOLUTIONS FOR AMERICA.

72
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:26,787
SOME DEMOCRATIC CONSULTANTS,

73
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:27,521
PEOPLE IN THE PARTY ARE WARNING

74
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:28,255
DEMOCRATS ALL THEY ARE DOING IS

75
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:38,566
CAMPAIGNING AGAINST

76
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:39,133
DEMOCRATS ALL THEY ARE DOING IS
CAMPAIGNING AGAINST THE

77
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:39,967
PRESIDENT THAT WON'T WORK FOR

78
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:40,668
PEOPLE ON THE GROUND IN THEIR

79
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:41,602
STATES.

80
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:42,469
WANT TO GET AHEAD, NOT GOING TO

81
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:43,170
WORK IF YOU JUST CAMPAIGN ON

82
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:43,771
IMPEACHING DONALD TRUMP.

83
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:44,471
SPEAKING OF DONALD TRUMP, ON

00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:50,144
TWITTER HE SAID GREAT NIGHT FOR

00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:50,878
REPUBLICANS, CONGRATULATIONS TO

00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:51,612
JOHN COX ON A REALLY BIG NUMBER

87
00:02:51,612 --> 00:02:52,046
IN CALIFORNIA.

88
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:52,446
HE CAN WIN.

89
00:02:52,446 --> 00:02:53,113
EVEN FAKE NEWS CNN SAID THE

90
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:55,182
TRUMP IMPACT WAS REALLY BIG,

91
00:02:55,182 --> 00:02:55,883
MUCH BIGGER THAN THEY THOUGHT

92
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:56,584
POSSIBLE, SO MUCH FOR THE BIG

93
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:58,819
BLUE WAVE, IT MAY BE A BIG RED

94
00:02:58,819 --> 00:02:59,353
WAVE, WORKING HARD.

95
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:10,831
HE SAID MANY MORE

96
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:15,035

97
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:15,436
HE SAID MANY MORE REPUBLICAN

00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:16,170
VOTERS SHOWED UP YESTERDAY THAN

99
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:16,904
THE FAKE NEWS THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

100
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:17,638
POLITICAL PUNDITS DON'T GET WHAT

101
00:03:17,638 --> 00:03:18,372
IS GOING ON OUT THERE OR THEY DO

102
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:19,106
GET IT BUT REFUSED TO REPORT THE

103
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:19,740
FACTS, REMEMBER DEMS ARE

104
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,474
HIGH-TECH, HIGH CRIME, EASY TO

105
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:20,774
BEAT.

106
00:03:20,774 --> 00:03:21,475
DONALD TRUMP AGREES WITH YOU,

107
00:03:21,475 --> 00:03:21,642
EVERYTHING

108
00:03:24,445 --> 00:03:25,179
>> ABSOLUTELY AND WE HAVE TO BE

109
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:25,913
VIGILANT AS REPUBLICANS WE HAVE

110
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:26,480
DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF

111
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,883
RETIREMENTS, DEMOCRATS IN

112
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:30,618
CONGRESS, DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF

113
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:31,352
SEATS TO DEFEND, WE CAN'T REST

114
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:37,091
ON OUR LAURELS BUT WE HAVE

115
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:37,825
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NUMBER OF

116
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:38,525
PICKUPS ON THE SENATE SIDE AS

117
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:38,826
WELL.

118
00:03:38,826 --> 00:03:39,560
WHEN YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS IN HIGH

119
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,227
TAX STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA

120
00:03:40,227 --> 00:03:43,330
PUSHING MORE TAXES, MORE

121
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:43,964
REGULATION, SINGLE-PAYER

122
00:03:43,964 --> 00:03:45,766
HEALTHCARE AS THEIR AGENDA

123
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:46,433
AMERICANS ARE ALARMED ABOUT

124
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:48,035
THAT, WE ARE HAPPY TO SEE THE

125
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:50,204
TURNOUT.

126
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:54,308
EVEN AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET

127
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:55,042
LIKE YOU SAID IN CALIFORNIA, A

128
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:59,046
CONTESTED RACE, CONTESTED RACES

129
00:03:59,046 --> 00:03:59,680
IN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE

130
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,314
PRIMARIES THIS WEEK WHERE

131
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:03,384
REPUBLICANS MAY PICK UP THE SEAT

132
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:08,122
AND NEWER FACES, ONE MORE FACTOR

133
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:11,125
IS REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS HAVE

134
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:11,859
A RULE WHERE THEY ALLOW PEOPLE

135
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:14,161
TO BE LEADERS AND THAT FOSTERS

136
00:04:14,161 --> 00:00:00,000
-- DEMOCRATS HAVE A VERY OLDER
