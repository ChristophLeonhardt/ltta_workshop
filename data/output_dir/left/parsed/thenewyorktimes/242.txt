In 2014, you may have
taken a quiz online,
something that looked
like this.
And if you did, you probably
shared your personal data,
and your friends’ personal data,
with the company
that worked for President
Trump’s 2016 campaign.
Here’s how it happened.
It begins with a research firm,
Cambridge Analytica.
C.A. partnered with a U.K.-based
academic, Aleksandr Kogan,
who was using Facebook data
for research purposes.
Quizzes were sent to
around 300,000 Americans.
They looked innocuous —
over 100 personality traits
to agree or disagree with.
And you got paid less than $5.
But there was a catch.
To take the survey,
you had to log
into Facebook,
which gave Kogan
access to your profile,
including your
birth date, location
and, most importantly,
your Facebook likes.
Kogan combined the quiz results
with your Facebook data
to develop a psychometric model,
a sort of personality profile.
He then combined this
with voter records
and sent them to
Cambridge Analytica.
C.A. claims that these
models were the heart
of how they profiled you —
your neuroses and
other exploitable traits.
But Kogan and C.A.
didn’t stop there.
His app also grabbed the personal
data of your Facebook friends
and compiled similar
profiles of them.
In just months,
270,000 people
took Kogan’s survey,
and the data of up to 87 million
friends was also harvested —
close to one-quarter
of all U.S. Facebook users.
C.A. then used that data
to target people,
maybe you,
with political messaging.
C.A. said this targeting helped
the Trump campaign’s strategy,
but the campaign
disputes this.
Kogan’s work claimed to be
for academic research,
but he also shared your information
with Cambridge Analytica —
a violation of
Facebook’s policies.
So, was it a data breach?
Facebook says no — that
no passwords were stolen
and no systems
were infiltrated.
But Mark Zuckerberg has said
it was a breach of trust
between Facebook and its users.
The U.S. Federal Trade
Commission
is investigating the case.
