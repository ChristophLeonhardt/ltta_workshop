I have two distinct thoughts on the lettings on the one hand it's absurd it's absurd and ridiculous to try to remove gender from language it because what we're trying when we try to remove gender when we try to abstract gender from sex when we try to say that there's no such thing as sexual to everything we know it butts up against reality we know that isn't the case we'll get to this in a second too in The Handmaid's Tale we know that isn't the case we know that there is sexual difference it feels so tedious and politically correct and like you're living in a fantasy and you see this with people who are PC all the time they have to constantly preface every single thing they're gonna say say well I want and and by the way I just want you to know that I'm a tenor but that isn't to say that I'm a debtor and I also and I'm sorry if but puppet didn't shut up just spit it out I don't know that much time tell me what you're gonna say so we know that this is an absurd fantasy world because sexual difference does matter and it's in here's in these languages but then my second thought on the latinx is I love it I love it because it exposes the left for what they are which is imperialists they are imperialists what they are saying is these liberal white wackos with purple hair in America are saying hey Hispanic people your anti-hispanic stop using that language of yours and use our language to describe you because we're compassionate and we're supporting you say what well then stop telling us to then stop telling us have to do other language but I don't know I was trying it's not a great Latin accent my tinks accent it's crazy the way the English if you want to refer to it in English it's Latin that's it it's not Latino it's not my Tina it's not latina at it's not letting X it's Latin because we speak English Latino and what tanks are not English words until merriam-webster wants to pretend that they are it's Latin that's fine when I I don't refer to Italiano's I don't say like hey yeah so I was I was down in the Bronx the other day and I was hanging out with some of my Italian all friends you know I don't do I say it Italian friends see she Leon old friends you know no nobody does that oh I was going you know I was down there hanging out with Nicholas a nipple say means that Nicole say it won't really no it's so stupid but when it comes to Spanish when it comes to issues of Hispanic people or Latin people we have to all of a sudden affect these crazy accent and and pretend that we're speaking another language which were not and then pretend that other language is even a separate language which exists only in fiction it's crazy they only do it when it comes to Latin Americans because it's all about political ideology I talk about this all the time it the way they use these words is 1,000% politically ideology we should reject it we should laugh at it
