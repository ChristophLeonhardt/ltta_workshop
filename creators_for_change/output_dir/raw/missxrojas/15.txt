Hi, my name is Yurleidis Córdoba Mena

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,200
and I'm here to tell you about the Interethnic School.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,760
The Interethnic School is a space that hosts and protects

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,760
young people of different ethnicity

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,360
who are mestizo, Afro-Colombian, and Indigenous.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,360
My name is Erika Orijuela Quinto

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,360
How did the Interethnic school begin?

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,520
It was created through the work of ethno-territorial organisations

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,960
because of the armed conflict

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,860
that affected and is affecting young people in the municipality of Riosucio, Chocó.

11
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,160
The Interethnic School is a space of protection

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,800
grounded in a base of community, interethnic, and intergenerational

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,040
exchange of knowledge and experiences

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,040
to strengthen the capacities of participants

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,400
which provides the development of strategies for solutions

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,320
against the [??] and gaps in protection

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,980
to which young people are exposed.

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,220
It is a traveling school, which is to say it's mobile.

19
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,620
It does not have a space, or a permanent/constant physical space

20
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,880
the places where it mostly does its work are principally: the basin of Rio Truandó

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,880
Salaquí and Cacarica.

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,180
Hi, my name is Maryurí Mosquera Palacio

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,540
I am part of the Interethnic Youth Leadership School in the municipality of Riosucio, Chocó.

24
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:25,480
The expectation that I have for the Interethnic School in 2019 is a more inclusive school

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:33,240
considering that the 200 young people who take part are not the only young people in the municipality and  local authorities.

26
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,100
I would also like if in 2019

27
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,180
the Interethnic School took all the young people in the municipality of Riosucio, Chocó.

28
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,660
So that it's not a limited quota but an open quota

29
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,960
considering that this is a space that allows young people

30
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,320
to gain knowledge in an area of ​​protection and in the care of the territory.

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,160
Thank you very much.

32
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,080
Hi, my name is Yarlenis Córdoba Ramos

33
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,100
and I want to make an invitation to all to people who want to take part

34
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,100
in the development of the Interethnic School

35
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,100
which is very important for us young people.

36
00:02:07,100 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone who wants to support us, well the door is open. Thank you.
