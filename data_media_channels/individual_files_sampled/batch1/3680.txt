I'm Shelly Culbertson I'm a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation and I study issues in the Middle East related to refugees stabilization and public sector development we've concluded that unless a series of urgent steps take place over the coming year to provide some of the prerequisites for iraq to get back on a path to stability violence could resume once again in a matter of months given all of the american lives that we've lost as and the many many Iraqi lives that have been lost it's very much in US national interest to take a leading role in the stabilization of Mosul and other parts of Iraq as well as in the military victory the US has actually taken a very large role in the humanitarian effort the u.s. is the largest donor to humanitarian assistance and so it's ongoing and sustains and an additional support is really needed in order to prevent that to happen Mosul will require a number of steps in order to rebuild it and to set it back on a path to prosperity I think many of the most important steps that are required will happen during the first year really providing a lot of the prerequisites so that it can rebuild and get on a path to growth again so one of those is figuring out how to deal with the displaced people that are from Mosul so about 800,000 people are still living displaced out of Mosul so working on policies and plans to help them get back home but for them to be able to come back home they have to be able to go home and find intact homes health education and so forth that are there one big obstacle to them going home is the level of explosive hazards that Isis left Isis left mines booby traps etc really on an industrial scale they did this as a tactic to keep civilians from coming back home so they mined hospitals pharmacies schools water lines the level of baby cribs a really big first step in order to make all of this happen is significant investment in demining not just in public utilities and services but also in housing a next important step is making sure that the city is secure in order to secure Mosul and prevent Isis from moving right back in the city requires about 60,000 troops just to maintain the status quo and unfortunately there's a risk that because of the ongoing fight against Isis elsewhere that those troops could be drawn off Mosul also needs about 25,000 trained police and to date about 15,000 have been hired and trained and while the Coalition is working on training other police police who are important to keep the peace in the streets prevent reprisals prevent looting that training isn't fast enough so the situation is pretty urgent Mosul also requires investment in its public services rebuilding some of the water electricity sewage lines that's underway the schools are starting to open but many of these things need a bit of a long-term plan both to build infrastructure get the people back the staff the doctors and nurses the teachers and to help do some of the the indoctrination that happened during that time and finally some bigger issues regarding governance and Reconciliation will need to be addressed many communities in Nineveh province of which Mosul is the capital just don't trust each other anymore there's a lot of trauma between the Sunnis the Shiites this should the Christians the Yazidi is the Turkmen and so forth and so there's some there's important steps that need to happen in terms of local reconciliation in addition to working with Baghdad on a broader national plan for reconciliation particularly in a road map among the Sunnis the Shiites the Kurds and others you
