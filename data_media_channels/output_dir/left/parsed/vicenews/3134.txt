right now Turkey is witnessing its
greatest moment of mayhem and upheavals
as the gezi Park protests last summer
the spark of the unrest live in a casket
behind us inside that casket is the body
at 15 year old boy bird Kim Alvin
nine months ago he was hit in the head
by at least tear gas canister while
shopping for bread yesterday the news
that he died was thousands of Turks in
over 15 cities that hit the streets his
death has become a platform for millions
to vent against what they see as an
increasingly authoritarian Prime
Minister his government
you can see the streets are packed with
thousands of people even more than
expected
physically could not be any more people
on the streets so right now the coffin
is still inside they're preparing to
clear a corridor
this is the march of people heading
towards the cemetery following the
coffin for the burial the mood is very
different than it was last night last
night the mood was very tense very angry
very hostile today I think just by the
sheer fact of numbers the sheer amount
of people that are here that word is one
of the most celebratory empowering I
mean look it just goes on forever
so we're back in in the center of
Istanbul this is Phil the funeral
procession marching towards the cemetery
and it's growing by the minute
everywhere a few more more people so it
looks like the police have abandoned
their vehicles a couple of them have
been attacked and some few volunteer
protesters are trying to protect the
police vehicles and further damage
we finally made it to the cemetery
were there Barry Bosco you killin unity
to deliver a leader a leader
Helen give you sue Thomas altitudes
Amamiya Helen give a bashar Suzuki see a
tortoise Kazama good a very nice Fido a
large to struggle on my ear William
Hawkins mindlessness
we just get it here to say him a proper
goodbye because we lost a child because
of a police terror and only justice can
be brought by people standing together
showing solidarity to each other and why
do you think things will go from here
what do you think what happens if you
dig a bit from the grief you will find
the anger that's the that's how people
feel right now just it needs a spark
it's so easy that and a I'm sure that
the spark will come from the police side
like it happened last night it's
actually it's so like expected from the
state and now we are hearing about
turkeys changing but changing to that
which direction state of justice or
state of occupy so when we left the
funeral things were very peaceful but we
just got information that another group
of protesters were leaving the funeral
were attacked by police with water
cannon and tear gas as they were walking
towards the center of Istanbul
we have protesters throwing stones at
police police growing stones back and I
think firing teargas
so far tonight we've seen very few
protesters the police have been quite
successful in keeping people separate
and away from the main arteries of
Istanbul there seems to be far more
police talking about these small streets
than protesters
basic visual or guitar can reach the
plastic man's / guzzle his Metal Mulisha
their army dudes yeah so we've just
arrived in a neighborhood called quarter
louche we heard that about 15 minutes
ago protesters had some controllers and
territory here
it seems that wherever the protesters
are making some kind of presence felt
tonight the police are moving in hard
there's blood spattering on the floor
which is where a rice man was hit in the
head with a tear gas canister fired by
the police
thanks I returned to liven up again they
threw some rocks on the cops and the
cars fired back
today began with more than 100,000
people marching peacefully against an
acts of police brutality
unfortunately however they ended with
further police brutality the day belong
to the demonstrators but the night to
the police
Istanbul streets are now empty of
protests but for how long
Prime Minister Erdogan called
demonstrators charlatans terrorizing the
streets before local elections scheduled
later this month he challenged his
opponents to fight him not on the
streets but in the ballot box I guess
we'll see who comes off worse
