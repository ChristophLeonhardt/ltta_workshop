DANA PERINO. "THE FIVE" ." RECENTLY, CNN ASKED, WITH ALL THE GOOD NEWS, WHY AREN'T PEOPLE SMILING? IT IS LIKE THE LOCAL SKUNK WONDERING WHY EVERYTHING AROUND HIM STINKS. CLUELESS RESULTS FROM THE COMPLETE DENIAL OF HOW DONALD TRUMP WORKS, FUELED BY CONFIRMATION BIAS THAT SEEKS ONLY TO PROVE THEIR NEGATIVE POINT. TAKE NORTH KOREA. MONTHS AGO, IT WAS A NUCLEAR WAR. TRUMP'S FURY. HE WILL RESPOND TO NORTH KOREA WITH A FIRE AND POWER THE WORLD IS NEVER SEEN. WILL THEY WERE WORDS ESCALATE INTO AN ACTUAL NUCLEAR WAR? WHAT HE SAYS IF THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE THREATS, NOT AN ATTACK, BUT MORE THREATS FROM NORTH KOREA, WE ARE GOING TO SEE IN EFFECT A NUCLEAR WAR. PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TODAY THREATENED NUCLEAR WAR. Greg: THAT DID NOT AGE WELL, NOR SHOULD IT. WE CAN'T LET THE PRESS FORGET IT. ESPECIALLY WHEN TRUMP PEGS TO START MEETING WITH AN UNPREDICTABLE MAN WITH A STRANGE HAIRCUT. ENOUGH ABOUT RODMAN. ROCKET MAN. MONTHS AGO, HE WAS DOCTORING EVIL. NOW HE IS AT THE TABLE. REMINDS ME OF A SITCOM FROM THE '90s. SO WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. Greg: OH, GOD. BEFORE YOU SAY KIM WINS BY INCLUSION, ISN'T THAT HOW DIPLOMACY WORKS? MEET WITH THE GUIDE, TALK TO HIM. IT'S FUNNY. DIALOGUE USED TO BE THE LEFT'S A BOARD. WE ARE ALWAYS BEING TOLD WE NEED A NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT STUFF, SO HERE'S AN INTERNATIONAL CONVERSATION. YET THE SAME WHO CONDEMN TRUMP'S FIRE AND FURY CHIDE THE OPPOSITE. MAYBE IF TRUMP SAYS HE IS DIALOGUING WITH KIM, CNN CAN AVOID ANOTHER CRYING JAG. WE HAVE GONE FROM FRETTING OVER WHERE TO DEBATING THE HOTEL BILL. HOW CAN THE PRESS MISSED THIS? THEY HATE THE GUY, TRUMP, THAT IS. THEY ARE SO MARRIED IS SAFE, PREDICTABLE POLITICIANS WHOSE MAIN RISK INVOLVES CHOOSING THE RED TIE FOR THE FUND-RAISER, TRUMP RUN CIRCLES AROUND THEM BECAUSE IN HIS WORLD, HE HAS TO. I'VE SAID IT BEFORE. KIM MAY BE A DICTATOR BUT TRUMP IS A DEVELOPER FROM QUEENS. I AM NOT SURE WHAT IS SCARIER. ALL RIGHT, I GUESS I SHOULD BREAK THE NEWS HERE THAT I AM GOING TO SINGAPORE. ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT? I DON'T HAVE MY CREDENTIALS YET. Dana: HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO ON THE PLANE? Greg: I'M GOING TO DO GREAT. GORKA IS GOING. SO IF GORKA IS GOING, I THINK I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO, RIGHT? Kimberly: GOD HELP WHOEVER IS FLYING NEXT TO YOU ON ANY FLIGHT. Greg: WHY SHOULDN'T ONE OF US BE ABLE TO GO? Brian: "WATTERS' WORLD" SHOULD DEFINITELY GO. Greg: YOU WITH DIAMOND AND SILK. Kimberly: RODMAN. Juan: LORD HAVE MERCY. THAT INTRO, IT WAS SO RIDICULOUS THAT INTRO, IT WAS SO RIDICULOU RIDICULOUS. IT'S LIKE AN '70 SHOW BUT THE THING IS, THAT'S THE WORLD WE'RE LIVING IN. DENNIS RODMAN. COME ON, MAN. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. NOW YOU'RE APPROACHING THE POINT WHERE YOU SAY THIS ISN'T THIS IS ABSURDITY. IT'S LIKE SOMETHING SOMEONE DREAMED UP A PLAY AND YOU SAY NO ONE IS GOING TO BELIEVE THAT. JUMPED THE SHARK A LONG TIME AGO. Greg: THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HASN'T HAPPENED BEFORE AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY IT'S HAPPENING. DANA. THEY TOOK A SALESMAN FROM QUEENS THEY TOOK A SALESMAN FROM QUEEN QUEENS. THE PROCESS, YOU LOOK AT IT LIKE A PROCESS. BUYING A HOUSE OR RENOVATING A PROPERTY. COULD YOU SAY THAT'S HOW HE'S LOOKING AT THIS? Dana: MAY BE. BUT I ALSO THINK ONE OF THE REASONS IT'S HAPPENING IS BECAUSE THE KIM FAMILY, KIM JONG UN BEING THE ULTIMATE ONE, THEY GOT THE NUCLEAR WEAPON ONE, THEY GOT THE NUCLEAR WEAPO WEAPON. NOW THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE EQUALS. THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE AN ABILITY TO COME TO THE TABLE AND ACTUALLY NEGOTIATE. THE STICKING POINT ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION, WHAT IS REALLY MEAN AND HOW DOES IT ALL WORK. I WOULD TEND CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. NOT NECESSARILY A CYNIC OR SKEPTIC. I HOPE IT WORKS. I ALSO KNOW WE ARE DEALING WITH THE NORTH KOREANS. Juan: I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST DOPES LIKE ME WHO WERE SKEPTICAL. Greg: EVERYBODY IS. Dana: THE SHOW IS CALLED "WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS." Juan: GREG IS DEFENDING THE PRESIDENT IS A SALESMAN FROM QUEENS. HE'S JUST A GUY FROM QUEENS. THE DEMOCRATS' ARGUMENT WOULD BE WAIT A SECOND. DON'T WE USUALLY HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MASTERED FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DIPLOMACY INVOLVED. THEY DECIDED, BELIEVE ME, THERE WERE PREVIOUS OFFERS FROM THE KIM FAMILY, THE GRANDFATHER, FATHER, NOW HIM, FOR MEETINGS BUT EVERYBODY SAID NO BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GIVING YOU THAT. YOU SAID THAT WAS DOPEY AND OLD-SCHOOL. Greg: YOU KNOW WHAT TRUMP IS. HE IS LIKE "THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT." AFTER THAT MOVIE CAME OUT, ALL OF THE MOVIES CHANGED. Dana: WITH THE HORRIBLE CAMERAWORK. Greg: I WAS TERRIFIED. I WANT TO RESPOND TO JUAN'S MISGUIDED BELIEF WE SHOULD BE DOING THE SAME THING. Juan: I DIDN'T SAY THE SAME THING. AS DANA SAID, THE MAN HAS NUKES NOW. HE DIDN'T HAVE NUKES BEFORE. Greg: HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? Kimberly: HERE IS THE THING. PEOPLE GET UPSET, THEY THINK RODMAN IS LIKE A SIDESHOW. HE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY PLACE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS. THIS IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH KIM JONG UN. IF KIM JONG UN FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE WITH HIS FRIEND FOR LIFE, DENNIS RODMAN THERE, FINE. GIVE HIM HIS SECURITY BLANKET. LET HIM HAVE HIM THERE. IT WILL BE FINE. WHO CARES? THAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE. ULTIMATELY IF THE GOAL GETS ACHIEVED IN THEIR CALL FOR SOMETHING AND THEY ARE ABLE TO DENUCLEARIZE, WOULD ANYBODY REALLY CARE WHETHER DENNIS RODMAN WAS IN THE COUNTRY AT THE TIME OR NOT? I HAVE ABOUT THE RESULTS AND MOVING ON TARGET AND GETTING YOU THE FINISH LINE. IF THAT IS SOME KIND OF PECULIAR THING THAT MAKES HIM FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE THAT IT ISN'T SOME KIND OF ASSASSINATION PLOT ON HIM OR SOMETHING, AND HE'S LIKE OKAY, I'M GOING TO BE SAFE. MY BUDDY. HE'S BEEN THERE SIX TIMES IN NORTH KOREA. Brian: YOU REMEMBER WHEN THEY LEFT SENT JAMES TAYLOR TO EUROPE, THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS BRILLIANT. TRUMP SENDS RODMAN AND HE GETS BEAT UP FOR THAT. I DON'T SEE WHAT THE DIFFERENCES. KIMBERLY'S POINT IS RIGHT. HE HAS MET LITTLE ROCKET MAN MORE THAN ANY OTHER AMERICAN ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. THEY HAVE SOME KARAOKE TOGETHER. THEY HAVE GONE SKIING TOGETHER. THEY PLAYED PING-PONG, BASKETBALL. LISTEN TO THE THINGS HE SAID ABOUT DENNIS RODMAN. HE SAYS HE'S LIKE A LITTLE KID WHO DOESN'T WANT MORE. THINGS AMERICANS ARE GOING TO TRY TO TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY SO HE WANTS HEATH HE FEELS LIKE THAT'S HIS ONLY DEFENSE. HE WANTS TO HAVE WITH CULTURE IMPROVED. AND HE LOVES AMERICA. THEY SAID WHEN HE WENT OVER THERE, HE PLAYED THE SOUNDTRACK OF "DALLAS." Kimberly: HE IS LIKE GREG. Jesse: FOR FOUR HOURS, HE PLAYS THOSE THEME SONGS. Greg: SO HE IS INSANE. Jesse: TO YOUR POINT ABOUT REAL ESTATE, HE IS LIKE A MOTIVATED BUYER. HE REALLY WANTS HIS COUNTRIES TO SUCCEED AND HE REALLY WANTS HE WANTS MONEY AND TRUMP POINTS OUT THIS GUY OUT. HE BRINGS HIM TO THIS FIVE-STAR LUXURY RESORT OR ITS LEICA $3500 TASTING MENU, PEACOCKS ROAMING AROUND. THIS EAST MEETS WEST DEAL. $6,000 PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. HE IS SAYING CAPITALISM CAN BE GOOD IF YOU DO THE RIGHT THING. Kimberly: AND NOW HE HAS READ "ART OF THE DEAL." Greg: IT'S AN OLD SALES TACTIC THAT YOU HAVE THE CLIENT THINKING THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO LOSE THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE. SO THEY HAVE GOTTEN THIS FAR. I HAVE THIS BEFORE. GIULIANI WAS TALKING ABOUT NORTH KOREA AND HE SAYS HE'S GOT NORTH KOREA ON ITS KNEES. THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU SHOULDN'T BE SAYING. Dana: IT'S NOT NECESSARY. Greg: NO, GIULIANI, STOP. Dana: SAY IT AT PRIVATE DINNER PARTY, NOT TELEVISION. Greg: HE WANTED TO FEEL LIKE A WHEN-WIN. Juan: THE REAL PERSON WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT GOING IS JOHN BOLTON. Greg: IS HE GOING? Juan: YES. I THINK HE IS THE ONE THAT SCARES KIM JONG UN, RIGHT? Greg: I AGREE. Juan: AS JESSE WAS ALLUDING TO, SOMEONE CAN TAKE HIM OUT AND WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW MARK QADDAFI WHEN WE MADE THE Greg: IT WAS THE PROBLEM WHEN BOLTON SAID THAT. Juan: CONTINGENT ON PART OF THAT IS I THINK BOLTON WAS A BIG PROPONENT OF THE IRAN DEAL. IDEALLY IF WE HAD THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME FROM WHAT HAPPENS, YOU KNOW WHAT, IT WOULD BE THE NORTH KOREAN DEAL ALONG THE LINES OF THE IRAN DEAL WHEN BOLTON IS AN OPPONENT THERE. Jesse: YOU MEAN WHEN YOU CAN SELF INSPECT YOUR OWN NUCLEAR FACILITIES. Juan: GO ON WITH THAT BOGUS ARGUMENT. Jesse: YOU WANT TO HAVE A THING $6 BILLION IN CASH. Juan: EVEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CERTIFIED THE DEAL. I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE, BY THE WAY, IS WE GO BACK AND SAY THE KOREAN WAR IS OVER, WE ARE GOING TO BE FRIENDS. THIS IS THE START OF THE PROCESS. I THINK THE PRESIDENT SAID MUCH THE SAME. Greg: BREAKING NEWS TODAY ABOUT, IN AP, PRESIDENT OBAMA FUDGING ABOUT THE IRAN Jesse: APPARENTLY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION LED THE IRANIANS TO SKIRT THESE FINANCIAL SANCTIONS TO GIVE THEM ACCESS TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF HARD AMERICAN CURRENCY. NO ONE KNEW THAT. THEY HAD TO GET A LAWSUIT FROM I BELIEVE JUDICIAL WATCH TO FIND THAT OUT. THEN THE AP REPORTED. TO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE IRANIANS, LARGEST STATE SPONSOR OF TERROR TO GET CASH BEHIND THE WORLDS BACK AND THAT'S NOT A SCANDAL? Juan: THAT'S NOT A SCANDAL. YOU KNEW THE WHOLE IDEA WAS TO GIVE THEM THE MONEY WE HAD FROZEN. IT WAS THEIR MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE. SECONDLY, TRY TO REINTEGRATE THEM INTO THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC STRUCTURE. Jesse: WHY DID THEY HIDE IT? Juan: JUST YOUR REACTION. Jesse: BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO REACT LIKE THAT? Juan: THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO GO HYPERBOLIC. Kimberly: DAY NOW. Dana: IT'S NOT ONLY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY WENT TO A COUPLE AMERICAN BANKS AND TRIED TO ASK HIM TO DO THIS, IT'S NOT MONEY-LAUNDERING BUT IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE THAT WHICH IS BASICALLY MAKE THIS MONEY RIGHT IN THE BANKS REFUSED. Jesse: YOU ARE SAYING BANKERS HAVE HIGHER ETHICAL STANDARDS THAN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION? Dana: IT WAS ABOUT CONCERN THEY WOULD BE PENALIZED BECAUSE OF IT. Greg: KIMBERLY. LAST WORD. HOW DO YOU THINK THE MEDIA IS GOING TO COVER IT. Kimberly: SENSATIONAL. THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE SOME JOKES ABOUT IT LIKE DENNIS RODMAN, LIKE THEY HAVE. I THINK THE OUTCOME IS GOING TO SPEAK FOR ITSELF IN TERMS OF BEING RESULT ORIENTED, HE'S GOING TO DO WHAT HE DOES IS ABLE TO WORK A DEAL. HE'S ABLE TO GO AND MEET WITH KIM JONG UN WHEN NO ONE ELSE WAS ABLE TO GET HIM TO THE TABLE. Greg: YOU KNOW WHAT I FOUND IN THE GREEN ROOM? I FOUND THIS BOOK. IT'S NEWT GINGRICH'S BOOK. TO STEVE DOOCY, A GREAT GUY WHO HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN THE MORNING. STEVE LEFT IT IN THERE.
