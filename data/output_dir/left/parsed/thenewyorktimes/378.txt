- We're pushing forward our
highly promising Strategic
Defense Initiative, a security
shield that may one day protect
us and our allies
from nuclear attack.
NARRATOR: President Reagan's
vision for a Space Age missile
shield never made it beyond
the realm of video games.
And that's still how people
often tend to picture it.
Even in real life, anti-missile
systems often sound like
impenetrable forcefields.
REPORTER: The system spotted
a missile and quickly fired.
- 42 scuds engaged,
41 intercepted.
- A 90% success rate in
neutralizing the missile
threat.
NARRATOR: But the reality is
that intercepting a supersonic
ballistic missile hurling
through the sky is anything
but simple, let alone foolproof.
For starters, how far and how
fast a missile can go varies
widely.
There's short range, medium
range, intermediate range,
then, of course, the
Intercontinental Ballistic
Missile, or ICBM.
All of them go through
multiple stages of flight.
First is the boost phase.
That's followed by the midcourse
phase and the final descent
before detonation,
the terminal phase.
To take out a ballistic missile,
you need sensors that can track
the incoming warheads
and launchers that fire
interceptors-- special missiles
that can destroy warheads
simply by colliding into them.
But not all missile
defense is created equal.
The US uses two different
categories to counter North
Korea.
There's theater defense, and
there's homeland defense.
Theater defense is regional.
It includes the anti-missile
systems in places like South
Korea, Japan, and Guam
that shield American troops
and allies from short and
medium-range missiles.
For example, US bases across the
region are armed with a Patriot
PAC-3, which intercepts tactical
warheads at close range just
before impact.
There are also 19 US warships in
the Pacific mounted with Aegis
naval defense radar
and launchers.
The ships can fire SM3
interceptors into space to take
out warheads in the
midcourse phase of flight.
And there are high-tech
truck-mounted launchers in Guam
and South Korea, part of the
Terminal High Altitude Area
of Defense, or THAAD.
Designed to be agile and mobile,
each truck launcher carries
eight interceptors capable of
destroying missiles 125 miles
away, inside or
outside the atmosphere.
Experts say that the theater
defense systems are not likely
to intercept every missile
in a real life attack,
but they've fared
well in field tests.
It's an entirely different
story when it comes to homeland
defense.
The system protecting the
continental US is called
Ground-Based Midcourse Defense.
It has between 36 and 44
interceptors in Alaska
and California, and so far, a
track record that might keep
you up at night.
In 18 test launches since 1999,
target missiles have been hit
only 10 times.
What's the problem?
A tough target.
The system aims
to destroy ICBMs,
which fly far higher and faster
than lower-range missiles.
Experts say it's like trying
to hit a bullet with a bullet--
bullets that may be flying 20
times faster than the speed
of sound, three times higher
than the International Space
Station.
The task is further complicated
by the flurry of debris
released when the nuclear
warhead separates from the rest
of the missile in space.
Differentiating the warhead from
the debris in the threat cloud
is difficult. Experts say
even a rising nuclear power,
like North Korea, is capable of
using simple decoys or multiple
missiles to confuse the sensors.
And this system is not even
designed to defend against
advanced ICBMs from
China or Russia.
Ground-based Midcourse Defense
is far from a magic shield.
But right now, it's the only
system protecting the US.
