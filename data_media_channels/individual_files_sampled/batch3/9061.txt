Tucker: WHY ARE SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE SO ANGRY? IT'S MOSTLY ECONOMICS. ERIC WEINSTEIN GOT THE CORE OF IT. HE SAID A YOUNG BREAD WINNER NEEDS TO BY A REASONABLY PRICED HOME IN A DECENT TOWN WITH MANY OPPORTUNITIES AND PROVIDE FOR A SECOND PARENT TO STAY HOME AND RAISE YOUNG CHILDREN. A NATION CANNOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG FOLKS TO TEND TO THE RAISES OF KIDS, WE HAVE PROBLEMS. WE DO. WE ORIGINALLY TALKED TO BRAD WILCOX FROM THE NATIONAL MARRIAGE PROJECTS ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. AS I WATCH THE PERENNIAL POPULARITY OF SOCIALISM COME BACK, PEOPLE MY AGE THINK SOCIALISM? REALLY? WHAT IS THE APPEAL. WHAT COULD BE THE APPEAL? I SEE NUMBERS LIKE THESE AND SAY IF WE DON'T FIX THEM, WE'LL GET SOCIALISM. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THINGS LIKE HEALTHCARE, EMPLOYMENT, DEBT AND THEY SEE THE GOVERNMENT AS A GOOD PLACE FOR THEM TO SEE GREATER SECURITY GIVEN THE BROADER CONTEXT WE'RE SEEING TODAY IN AMERICA. I WANT TO ZERO IN ON MARRIAGE. I KNOW YOU FOLLOW THAT. YOU STUDY IT CLOSELY. MARRIAGE IS AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS AN INDICATOR AND CAUSE OF PROSPERITY. MARRIED PEOPLE WITH KIDS TEND TO BE MORE ECONOMICALLY STABLE. WHAT CAN WE DO TO REVERSE THE TREND THAT IS CAUSING YOUNG PEOPLE TO DELAY OR AVOID MARRIAGE ENTIRELY? WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. ONE THING WE CAN DO IS GET RID OF THE MARRIAGE PENALTIES THAT FACE YOUNGER ADULTS AND POORER ADULTS AND THINGS LIKE MEDICAID, THE EIPC FOOD STAMPS. WE CAN ALSO DO MORE TO THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE DOING MORE SUBSIDIZED WORKING CLASS WAGES AND I ALSO THINK WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE CULTURAL CONTEST THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. THINK ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN MAKE MARRIAGE BOTH MORE APPEALING AND THE POP CULTURE AND TO THINK ALSO ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN DO MORE TO SPEND TIME IN PERSON AND LESS TIME ONLINE. LOOKS LIKE JOHN CULTURE IS PLAYING A BIG ROLE IN THE RE-RITA FOR MARRIAGE AND THE RETREAT FOR FERTILITY IN THE U.S. ALL OF US HAVE AN INTEREST IN THIS. MARRIED KIDS ARE NOT CALLING FOR ANTIFA. A COUNTRY WITH A LOT OF UNMARRIED PEOPLE IS A VOLATILE COUNTRY. WHY DON'T OUR POLICY MAKERS TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY? YOU KNOW, I THINK A LOT PEOPLE THINK OF MARRIAGE AS A PRIVATE ISSUE AND THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT AND SHOULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT MARRIAGE AND FERTILITY. THEY DON'T SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR FAMILIES AS A LOT TO DO WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND IN OUR COUNTRY MORE GENERALLY. Tucker: EXACTLY. THAT'S AN OBVIOUS POINT. WHY ISN'T EVERYBODY SAYING THAT? WHY DO WE IGNORE THIS AS A CAUSE OF SOCIAL VOLATILITY? VOLATILITY WRECKING THE COUNTRY? WHY DOES NOBODY SAY THAT? I THINK IT'S OBVIOUSLY THINGS RELATED TO DIVORCE AND SINGLE PARENTING COMPETITIONS ARE SENSITIVE FOR A LOT OF US. WE KNOW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS. THERE'S A RELUCTANCE TO ENGAGE. THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR. WE'VE SEEN WORK AT HARVARD THAT INDICATES WE'RE IN THE BEST PREDICTORS OF MOBILITY FOR POOR KIDS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS THE SHARE OF TWO PARENTS IN A COMMUNITY. Tucker: OF COURSE IT IS.
