the White House is working on a draft proposal and this proposal would be a unilateral change in rules for legal immigrants here in the United States and essentially it would make it even more difficult for legal immigrants to gain citizenship in the u.s. these are people who are currently in the u.s. with visas or with green cards they're individuals who are working paying taxes and so the Trump administration specifically Stephen Miller wants to make it impossible for them to ever gain citizenship and so this is the way they plan on doing it the crux of this proposal which has not been released yet would penalize legal immigrants if they or their family members have used government benefits defined very broadly widely in previous drafts of the policy so they need to work out the kinks of this policy in order to you know make it public they have had one disaster after the other because they don't think these things through so in this case they're working with the CBO they're trying to figure out whether or not they can legally or ethically do some of these things now the draft rule in its recent forms would include programs as expensive or expansive as health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act as well as some forms of Medicaid the Children's Health Insurance Program food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit I want to be clear for the for the second time these are people who are in the country legally they have green cards they are working they are paying taxes and so NBC which broke this story highlighted a couple of the immigrants who would be impacted by this and one of them is a Haitian man who has an adult daughter who is disabled he is working to become a nurse and he needs government benefits to help take care of his adult daughter with disabilities he is here legally with a green card but Stephen Miller does not want you know to have any you know I mean who cares about empathy of course he has no empathy but he just sees them as the who cares if you came here legally or illegally he wants you out okay this could block more than 20 million immigrants from becoming citizens so I'm gonna tell you about the TYT army and what you could do about it in a second but let's understand the point of this now this policy is racist in its effect now you could question whether it's racist in its purpose so here's what I mean by that so immigrants are from other countries obviously and in the old days immigrants were largely from Europe and and so and by the way back then there were bigoted laws against the Irish the Italians etc by the people who were largely English and German that were here and so this has been going on unfortunately in American history for a long time now the predominant immigrant groups are Latinos Asians etc so when you discriminate against them it is having a massively disproportionate effect on certain races now you could say no Steven Miller doesn't mean that he doesn't care what race they are he just doesn't want them becoming citizens because they are more likely to vote for Democrats so that doesn't change the effect the racist effect of the policy just says no he's against democracy and he thinks that you know they can't really win elections if you actually listen to the Constitution and think that everybody is equal and I actually trying to appeal to immigrants when they become citizens like hey you know we'll also look out for you that's another way of getting their votes and they're like no we're not gonna do that there's no way we're ever gonna look out for those people there's no way we're ever gonna deliver for them and we don't want there and we're not gonna get there but we're not even to try for their vote so what we're gonna do instead is we're going to block them from becoming citizens and I'm positive that there's some Republicans that watch this now going like yeah that's good I like that make sure we ruin their lives they were on a pathway they were doing everything right they were doing everything right legally the ones the thing that you told them to do your whole life well we're not against legal immigrants we're just against illegal immigrants this isn't about race no no we just want you to do it the legal way so here's 20 million people who are doing it the league and now all of a sudden you pulled the rug I go just kidding I never liked you and so if we can prevent you from becoming citizens and ruin your lives to have a slight in a best-case scenario a slight political advantage then we'll do it in a second now maybe other Republicans might be upset about that but I doubt it I really really doubt it and if they are upset about it they got a funny way of showing it so so we're gonna steal from these people because that's essentially what that is I mean they are people who are here paying taxes so we are going to penalize them for paying taxes doing things legally and then if they need assistance we're gonna deny that to them or or just penalize them and refuse to give them citizenship because they need that help I don't that's stealing we're essentially stealing from these people and the reason why Anna's calling us ileus because you pay taxes so if you at some point are on hard times and your kids are hungry and you need food stamps well we shouldn't penalize you for that that's part of why you pay taxes so these people also pay taxes they've followed the law in every way imaginable and then when you say okay well now they need something back from the government because that's the whole point you pay taxes and the government provides cops roads and sometimes yes a little help is to make sure your kids get lunch right we turn around to them go no you're not allowed to get that even though you've paid into the system we're just gonna take it from you or not let you get it or if you do take it that's it you're done you're banned it is a fundamental changing of the rules and and these people are bad guys they don't care and and so what TYT army what is it what's the point of it so I I started this and not that look we're just we're experimenting here we're trying to grow with you guys because what I all tell you all the time we're not the Young Turks you're the Young Turks okay so we asked for people to join us at TYT dot-com slash army to stop the lies that the right-wing spreads online and in the media and most importantly stop the media from going along with it okay because neutrality is the enemy of reality so in a story like this this proves without a shadow of a doubt that the Republican Party is against all immigrants they're not against illegal immigrants that's a lie they just showed you they're against all immigrants period period period okay so they're not so when the media does the right wing's bidding for them by saying oh the right wing says they're against illegal immigrants but they're for legal immigrants I want the TYT army to shove this up their ass okay proverbially politically don't actually do anything physical okay but to say no you're wrong in a polite way say you're wrong it's just not true please stop printing things that are not true the Republican Party is against legal immigrants that is a fact it's not a he-said she-said okay so and so what are we doing just asked you to email people to send it on Twitter always be super polite we're not like the lunatics on the right all we're trying we're not trying to defeat the press we're not trying to destroy the press we're trying to make the press better don't give me this hey the Republicans are for legal immigrants when it is not a fact your job as a reporters to report facts so T y-t-dot-com slash are me and you know we asked the army ones hey can you find us research of the bias that we've been talking about you guys sent in too many things okay there's like 50 examples so the next thing that we're trying to do now with the Army is then we need you guys help in curating too because there's people that are great at creating memes that are created research that are great at curating the research so let's all work on this together a joint project and all kidding aside seriously if we don't do it who's gonna do it right so and and our job look I want the press to be great okay and I think that that the right wing has gotten them to a place where they are neutral and not objective that where they are unfortunately unwittingly misleading the American people and they did it by creating pressure their pressure was filled with lies we can create pressure with truth so come join us at TYT dot-com slash army and then email us in an army at TYT Network com2 tell us hey you know what I would love to help with research I would love to help with looking through the research and figuring out hey what is the story that is most biased so that's the one we should go reach out to the reporters and politely tell them hey you know you got this one wrong and here's our evidence okay okay so we're gonna have some fun all right so look guys we're home with progressives and part of that is working together so join us at the army join us become a membership become a member be part of the Young Turks let's do this together and if you want to be a member and get all of our shows TYT dot-com slash join okay let's go actually fix what they get
