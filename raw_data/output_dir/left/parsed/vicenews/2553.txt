there are a bunch of pull these
travelers overhead
you just got here we were added by the
different protests in transfer up until
a few minutes ago but it seems like
police have pretty much left people walk
into the street we can see some officers
down into the sidewalk to the side right
here and people are kind of marching
back and forth between two police lines
review before number
what we can see if people are on the
highway but only really in like I wanted
to wrap area between 48th Street and
49th Street to my left and then there
are lines of police or black masses so
then the crowd doesn't really seem to be
able to spread much beyond this what if
I mean so they're kind of just walking
back and forth in this stop
hey I'm getting quite a bit of
supportive hops I've had a lot of people
expect this to be different because
there's video of what right right so
yeah you know Obama
can he bring some body cameras I don't
think that's gonna make a difference
it's like systemic problems yes it's so
sad we could have been me it could have
been my my mother could have been anyone
just like it actually does look like
it's coming to a head here
so that's you are humor officers coming
where you know wearing helmets and
carrying batons but so far again we
haven't really seen them in Korea but
when we do see people three police
officers with handcuffs
ready quite a few of them actually but
we haven't seen any arrests so far
we've actually moved quite a few blocks
up early at the West 79th at MIT we
started about 49th Street and people
have really been able to take over both
sides of the highway and moving uptown
professors are trying to figure out what
the next move is police a block with
road further up so really the options
are either going back for apparently
getting off one of the exits here we're
gonna stick around and see what they
decide to do so far they've really been
able to move all the way around I think
we're well into the seventies here I
can't quite see because our on the
highway but we've definitely moves quite
a way up from where the protests started
and I just thought that people were like
helping and helping lift you out of
there from New York City
from Harlem so I heard people saying
what headed to Harlem yes just now I'm
fighting for justice good it's my stuff
whoever got it knows ain't got killed by
officer and they died right well we will
be heard no justice no peace
what's up maybe try to do something I
have to do so did you did you see it
coming did you think he was not gonna
get indicted Christmas are really down
with it
we must quite a way up and people are
125th I don't know why but everybody
started to run right now they're running
person ease of grabbing people
so basically you some people running
like they were trying to get through
this police line before police grafted
and then some of the protesters running
behind up said the police were brought
in and on the back I'm assuming it's
gonna happen every box
some protesters and police now seem to
be pushing back actually see they're
moving the kind of people people to this
part of the screen and to the sidewalk
but they are letting people move around
you're all just as guilty I'll tell you
this I was born in the state of
Mississippi grew up in Texas where we
advocate for the death penalty I have
never seen a more racist city like New
York and again this is someone who was
born in Mississippi grew up in the state
of Texas the city of New York is far
more racism innocent I've lived in
Charlotte North Carolina I did
advertising for 20 years I lived in
Charlotte nard North Carolina I lived in
Denver Colorado I've lived in New
Orleans Louisiana this city is ready to
spend illusory sense of problem
we've got the system none of us like oh
right it's the system is flawed right
must pain bright must pay this country's
gonna be on fire before all this happens
you want justice you will get no justice
okay don't kill these people in the
streets because why the system is flawed
you were just here and use an apprentice
those who are where you wanna learn here
every day we've been out here
okay anyone of us
oh it's not like me than I am
you don't think it's more likely for
police to still take a consideration
that they have the old ologies is still
in the society but what is the real
system about it's about the Bill of
Rights about the law okay
the chokehold is what they use that is a
non departmental procedure okay it's not
a part of procedure okay you killed a
man for no reason another father demands
as a child for somebody
okay just none of our black or white
anymore in the 60s maybe it was but now
it's not any one of us can be a Michael
Brown or Eric garner
okay it's a system
we're on 125th Street walking all the
way over to the inside and then we were
just walking under the tracks of the the
metro rail and we run into something
some guys I live there asleep there and
they were telling us you know they've
been there long before long before this
protest started long before Eric garner
they've had their own experiences or
unconsciously police and they seem to be
a little skeptical about whether this
protest can really change anything but
pretty supportive nonetheless I would
say we are not back with the majority of
the group it seems we're on Lexington
and one time a store in East Harlem
Spanish Harlem right now and there are
officers here
processes we go around for hours now
it's moved all the way
