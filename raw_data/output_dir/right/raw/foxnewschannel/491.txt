1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,279
>> TRACE, NO QUESTION ABOUT

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:03,546
IT.

3
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:04,213
INCREDIBLE DRAMA.

4
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:06,515
IT'S BEEN PRETTY CLEAR THAT

5
00:00:06,515 --> 00:00:07,950
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE HAS BEEN

6
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,584
STRUGGLING WITH WHAT HE

7
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:09,852
HEARD IN THAT EMOTIONAL

8
00:00:09,852 --> 00:00:12,288
HEARING YESTERDAY FROM

9
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,522
PROFESSOR CHRISTINE BLASEY

10
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:14,223
FORD AND JUDGE BRETT

11
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:14,590
KAVANAUGH.

12
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,026
A LOT OF REPUBLICANS

13
00:00:17,026 --> 00:00:18,461
BREATHED A HUGE SIGH OF

14
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:19,462
RELIEF THIS MORNING WHEN

15
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:20,763
FLAKE SAID HE WOULD BE A YES

16
00:00:20,763 --> 00:00:22,565
ON THE KAVANAUGH NOMINATION.

17
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:23,733
HE SAID OUR SYSTEM OF

18
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:26,135
JUSTICE AFFORDS THE

19
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:26,969
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENT TO

20
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:29,739
THE ACCUSED ABSENT

21
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:30,639
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE.

22
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:31,674
DEMOCRATS APPEALED TO HIM

23
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:33,142
FOR ONE WEEK DELAY TO HAVE

24
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:34,176
THE FBI LOOK INTO THE

25
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:39,982
ALLEGATIONS.

26
00:00:39,982 --> 00:00:41,450
I THINK 2 WOULD BE PROPER TO

27
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,352
DELAY THE FLOOR VOTE FOR UP

28
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:47,323
TO BUT NOT MORE THAN ONE

29
00:00:47,323 --> 00:00:49,325
WEEK IN ORDER TO LET THE FBI

30
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:50,559
CONTINUE TO DO AN

31
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,193
INVESTIGATION, LIMITED IN

32
00:00:51,193 --> 00:00:57,033
TIME AND SCOPE TO THE

33
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:58,234
CURRENT ALLEGES THAT ARE

34
00:00:58,234 --> 00:00:59,835
THERE AND LIMIT IN TIME TO

35
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:01,070
NO MORE THAN ONE WEEK, I

36
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,206
WILL VOTE TO ADVANCE THE

37
00:01:03,206 --> 00:01:08,277
BILL TO THE FLOOR WITH THAT

38
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:08,711
UNDERSTANDING.

39
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:09,946
>> SENATOR COONS AND SENATOR

40
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:11,614
FLAKE HAVE BEEN WORKING

41
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:12,315
TOGETHER ON THIS.

42
00:01:12,315 --> 00:01:13,549
THIS WAS KIND OF A SURPRISE

43
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:14,750
TO ALL OF US.

44
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,052
SENATOR FLAKE HAS EXPRESSED,

45
00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:17,420
INCLUDING IN HIS SPEECH

46
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,755
YESTERDAY, HIS CONCERN ABOUT

47
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:20,823
THE DIVIDE IN THIS COUNTRY

48
00:01:20,823 --> 00:01:23,393
THAT IS BEING EXACERBATED BY

49
00:01:23,393 --> 00:01:24,227
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

50
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:25,528
AND, OF COURSE, WE HAVE BEEN

51
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:26,663
ASKING OVER AND OVER AGAIN

52
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:31,701
FOR FOLLOW-UP THE JUDGE

53
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:32,368
BRETT KAVANAUGH NOMINATION

54
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:34,004
WAS REPORTED OUT OF THE

55
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:35,072
COMMITTEE 11 TO 10 ALONG

56
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:36,306
PARTY LINES.

57
00:01:36,306 --> 00:01:37,140
JEFF FLAKE WANTS MORE TIME.

58
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,342
A NUMBER OF HIS COLLEAGUES

59
00:01:38,342 --> 00:01:39,376
HERE ON CAPITOL HILL THINK

60
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:40,444
THAT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD

61
00:01:40,444 --> 00:01:41,011
IDEA.

62
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:41,311
TRACE?

63
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:41,945
>> YEAH.

64
00:01:41,945 --> 00:01:43,013
ALL THE ATTENTION RIGHT NOW

65
00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:44,715
IS FOCUSED ON YOUNG SENATOR

66
00:01:44,715 --> 00:01:45,315
FLAKE, MIKE.

67
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:46,350
BUT THERE ARE OTHER KEY

68
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,751
SENATORS TO WATCH.

69
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:49,286
>> ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

70
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:50,320
ASSUMING SENATOR FLAKE STAYS

71
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,922
A YES ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH,

72
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:53,590
THERE ARE REALLY FOUR KEY

73
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,359
SENATORS TO WATCH VERY

74
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:55,792
CLOSELY.

75
00:01:55,792 --> 00:01:56,793
REPUBLICAN SUSAN COLLINS OF

76
00:01:56,793 --> 00:01:59,596
MAINE AND LISA MURKOWSKI OF

77
00:01:59,596 --> 00:02:01,131
ALASKA AND DEMOCRATS FROM

78
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:02,866
CONSERVATIVE STATES HEIDI

79
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:04,267
HEITKAMP OF NORTH DAKOTA AND

80
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:05,402
JOE MANCHIN OF WEST

81
00:02:05,402 --> 00:02:05,936
VIRGINIA.

82
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:07,004
MANCHIN SAID MOMENTS AGO HE

83
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:07,738
SUPPORTS A DELAY.

84
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:09,506
THIS CALL FOR DELAY HAS LEFT

85
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:10,806
SOME SENIOR REPUBLICANS

86
00:02:10,806 --> 00:02:12,242
SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS.

87
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:15,145
>> ALL I CAN SAY IS RIGHT

88
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:19,116
NOW WHAT JEFF IS SAYING IS

89
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:20,550
MAKES SENSE TO ME.

90
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,686
I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR MITCH.

91
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:24,454
I'M GOING TO TALK WITH JEFF.

92
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:25,522
SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO EXPLAIN

93
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:26,623
THIS TO TRUMP.

94
00:02:26,623 --> 00:02:28,625
I GUESS THAT WILL BE MY JOB.

95
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,893
>> SOME SOURCES CLOSE TO

96
00:02:29,893 --> 00:02:30,794
THIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS

97
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:31,762
THAT I HAVE SPOKEN WITH IN

98
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:33,630
THE LAST FEW MINUTES SAY

99
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,532
THIS COULD BE A BLESSING IN

100
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:37,868
DISGUISE IF IT GIVES SOME OF

101
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:38,869
THOSE MODERATE SENATORS SOME

102
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:40,470
COVER BY SAYING THE FBI

103
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,905
LOOKED INTO THE ALLEGATIONS

104
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:43,340
AND THEN IT WOULD BE TIME TO

105
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,908
VOTE.

106
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:45,208
TRACE?

107
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,943
>> YOU KNOW, MIKE, WE

108
00:02:46,943 --> 00:02:47,778
THOUGHT THIS WEEKEND WAS

109
00:02:47,778 --> 00:02:48,745
GOING TO BE ALL ABOUT KIND

110
00:02:48,745 --> 00:02:49,546
OF LOBBYING.

111
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:50,514
THE LOBBYING EFFORT.

112
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:51,715
NOW THAT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ON

113
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:53,784
THE BACK BURNER.

114
00:02:53,784 --> 00:02:56,653
WHAT'S THE PATH MOVING

115
00:02:56,653 --> 00:02:56,987
FORWARD?

116
00:02:56,987 --> 00:03:00,190
>> EVERYBODY ON CAPITOL HILL

117
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,458
ALL EYES ON THE SENATE

118
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,127
MAJORITY LEADER.

119
00:03:04,127 --> 00:03:05,529
HE WAS PLANNING PROCEDURAL

120
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:06,897
VOTES OVER THE WEEKEND AND

121
00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:07,831
FLOOR ACTION MONDAY AND

122
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:08,966
TUESDAY HOPING TO CONFIRM

123
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:09,800
JUDGE KAVANAUGH BY TUESDAY.

124
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,568
IF HE NEEDS HELP IN GETTING

125
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:13,136
TO 50 VOTES, IT WOULD SEEM

126
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:14,738
MCCONNELL WOULD ALLOW A ONE

127
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:16,206
WEEK DELAY BUT THIS ENTIRE

128
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:17,674
PROCESS IS REALLY NOW IN THE

129
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:19,376
HANDS OF MCCONNELL AND THE

130
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:20,911
GUY DOWN THE STREET,

131
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,813
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

132
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:23,113
TRACE?

133
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:24,615
>> YEAH, I JUST WANT TO FLAG

134
00:03:24,615 --> 00:03:26,016
YOU TO THIS, MIKE, BECAUSE

135
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:28,318
WE JUST GOT AN URGENT SAYING

136
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:29,353
THAT SENATE G.O.P. LEADERS

137
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:30,821
ARE MEETING WITH FLAKE AND

138
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:32,756
GRASSLEY AND OTHER JUDICIARY

139
00:03:32,756 --> 00:03:34,491
COMMITTEE MEMBERS ABOUT HOW

140
00:03:34,491 --> 00:03:36,693
TO PROCEED ON KAVANAUGH.

141
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:38,295
THAT'S A KEY MEETING GOING

142
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:39,563
ON SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOMS

143
00:03:39,563 --> 00:03:40,264
BEHIND YOU.

144
00:03:40,264 --> 00:03:43,033
>> YEAH ONE WOULD ASSUME,

145
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:43,968
THEY WOULD SAY FINE, BUT

146
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:45,369
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEAD THIS

147
00:03:45,369 --> 00:03:48,305
DRAG ON WEEK AFTER WEEK

148
00:03:48,305 --> 00:03:49,473
AFTER WEEK.

149
00:03:49,473 --> 00:03:50,541
SOME SOURCES I HAVE TALKED

150
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,709
TO CLOSE TO THE PROCESS SAY

151
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,010
THEY ARE OKAY WITH A LITTLE

152
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,345
MORE TIME IF IT ALLOWS THE

153
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:55,713
FBI TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE

154
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:57,381
STUFF AND ALLOWS SOME OF

155
00:03:57,381 --> 00:03:58,182
THESE MODERATE SENATORS TO

156
00:03:58,182 --> 00:03:59,517
GET TO YES, TO GET HIM

157
00:03:59,517 --> 00:00:00,000
ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.
