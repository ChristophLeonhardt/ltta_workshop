>> Martha: TONIGHT, FORMER FBI
DEPUTY DIRECTOR ANDREW McCABE
BACK IN THE NEWS THIS EVENING.
HE IS NOW SUING THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT AND THE FBI.
HE SAYS HE WAS UNJUSTLY FIRED
AND THAT HE CAN PROVE IT.
ED HENRY JOINS US NOW.
HE IS STILL IN SINGAPORE TONIGHT
WITH THE VERY LATEST ON THIS
STORY.
WHY IS HE SUING THEM?
>> MARTHA, FOR A NUMBER OF
REASONS.
JUST BREAKING NOW, FOX HAS
OBTAINED, THIS 36 PAGE LAWSUIT
FROM ANDREW McCABE.
THE FORMER NUMBER TWO OFFICIAL
OF COURSE AT THE FBI.
WHAT IS HE SAYING?
HE SAYING THAT HE WAS UNFAIRLY
FIRED.
WE KNOW THAT ALREADY FROM MARCH
BUT THAT HE HAS BEEN WANTING TO
GET DOCUMENTS FROM THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT, FROM THE FBI TO
EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT HIS FIRING.
HE WAS FIRED IN MARCH, REMEMBER
FOR LEAKING INFORMATION
IMPROPERLY TO THE MEDIA AND THEN
MORE IMPORTANTLY PERHAPS LYING
TO INVESTIGATORS ABOUT IT.
THAT'S THE ALLEGATION.
SO WHY IS HE SUING NOW?
NUMBER ONE, THERE HAVE BEEN
REPORTS THAT JAMES COMEY, HIS
FORMER BOSS, THE TOP GUY OF
COURSE AT THE FBI, HAS BEEN
CALLED IN TO TALK TO A U.S.
ATTORNEY IN WASHINGTON BECAUSE
THEY ARE CONSIDERING CRIMINAL
CHARGES AGAINST ANDREW McCABE
ABOUT LYING TO INVESTIGATORS.
THEY ARE TRYING TO SQUARE HIS
STORIES WITH JAMES COMEY'S SO
BOTH McCABE AND COMEY UNDER
THE MICROSCOPE BUT THEN THE
OTHER BIG THING YOU MENTIONED
I'M HERE IN SINGAPORE,
WHITE HOUSE WAS OBVIOUSLY
FOCUSED ON ALL THIS DIPLOMACY
WITH NORTH KOREA THAT THEY WERE
ALL SO I CAN TELL YOU FROM
TALKING TO SENIOR OFFICIALS
LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON ON
THURSDAY, WHICH IS THAT THIS
FINALLY, FINALLY WE ARE GOING TO
SEE THIS INSPECTOR GENERAL
REPORT FROM THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT.
THERE ARE REPORTS OUT SAYING
IT'S GOING TO BE DEVASTATING FOR
ANDREW McCABE AND JAMES COMEY
BECAUSE THIS IS THE REPORT THAT
IS LOOKING AT THEIR CONDUCT IN
TERMS OF THE FBI INVESTIGATION
OF HILLARY CLINTON'S EMAIL
SERVER.
WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH US FOR
WEEKS, FOR MONTHS.
THIS REPORT IS GOING TO BE
DEVASTATING.
PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHERE IS
IT?
IT'S FINALLY COMING OUT
THURSDAY, INTERESTING THAT
ANDREW McCABE ABOUT TO TAKE IT
AGAIN PRETTY HARD ON THAT
REPORT, ALREADY FACING POTENTIAL
CRIMINAL CHARGES, ALREADY FIRED
FROM THE FBI IN MARCH, IS NOW
TRYING TO GET AHEAD MAY BE OF
THIS IG REPORT AND TRY TO GET
HIS SIDE OF THE STORY.
>> Martha: WE KNOW IT'S A 400
PAGE REPORT AND A COUPLE OF
THINGS HAVE LEAKED OUT THAT AT
ONE POINT THERE IS A SUGGESTION
THAT JAMES COMEY WAS
INSUBORDINATE IN THE WAY THAT HE
DEALT WITH THE EMAIL
INVESTIGATION AND A LOT MORE IS
GOING TO COME OUT ON THAT.
ANOTHER STORY THAT IS
PERCOLATING OUT THERE TONIGHT IS
AN INSIDE LOOK AT SOME OF THE
SORT OF SMALL GROUP MEETINGS
BETWEEN THE HOUSE INTEL
COMMITTEE LEADERSHIP AND ROD
ROSENSTEIN'S FOLKS, INCLUDING
ROB ROSENSTEIN HIMSELF, THAT
THESE HAVE, I'M HEARING ON MORE
THAN ONE OCCASION, IN FACT ON
MANY OCCASIONS, DEVOLVED INTO
SHOUTING MATCHES THAT SOMETIMES
LAST AS LONG AS 30 MINUTES.
AND THAT HE HAS BASICALLY
THREATENED TO SUBPOENA THEM FOR
THEIR EMAILS AND THEIR DOCUMENTS
BECAUSE HE'S ANGRY THAT THEY ARE
ASKING HIM FOR SO MUCH.
>> LOOK, ARE COLEY
CATHERINE HERRIDGE HAS BEEN ALL
OVER THE STORY PICKING UP THE
BALL THERE AND ROD ROSENSTEIN
SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN ON THE
FIRING LINE.
THE PRESIDENT AND OTHERS GOING
AFTER HIM BECAUSE HE OVERSEES
ROBERT MUELLER.
HE OVERSEES THE DOCUMENTS AT THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THERE SINCE
JEFF SESSIONS HAS BEEN RECUSED
AND HAMSTRUNG IF YOU WILL.
HE'S THE ONE OVERSEEING THOSE
DOCUMENTS THAT DEVIN NUNES AND
OTHER TOP REPUBLICANS WANT TO
SEE ABOUT WHETHER THERE WAS A
SPY EMBEDDED IN THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN OR NOT.
ALL OF THAT, AND YOU ARE RIGHT,
FROM OUR REPORTING IT SEEMS THAT
ROD ROSENSTEIN UNDER PRESSURE TO
TURN OVER DOCUMENTS HAS WARNED
THE SENIOR AIDES TO DEVIN NUNES
AND OTHERS WE WILL SUBPOENA YOUR
EMAILS.
WE WILL TRY TO GET SOME
DOCUMENTS FROM YOU AND DEVIN
NUNES AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN PUT
OFF BY THIS SAME WE ARE TRYING
TO DO LEGITIMATE OVERSIGHT OF
THE FBI AND THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT AND YOU WERE
BASICALLY THREATENING US IN
COMING AFTER US AND MAKING A
MOCKERY OF THE OVERSIGHT
PROCESS.
THIS TIES RIGHT BACK TO McCABE
AND THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE
INVESTIGATORS BASICALLY, WHICH
IS THE PRESIDENT TRYING TO
CHANGE THE NARRATIVE ABOUT
MUELLER IN SAYING WHAT ABOUT
ROSENSTEIN, WHAT ABOUT COMEY AND
WHAT ABOUT McCABE?
>> Martha: SOMETHING'S GOT TO
GIVEN THE SITUATION AND WE WILL
