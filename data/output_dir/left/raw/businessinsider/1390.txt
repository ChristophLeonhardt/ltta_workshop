00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
oh one second I<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like the way I'm</font>

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,179
sitting makes me look fat no<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

3
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,910

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,340
trim<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you look good keep</font>

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,990
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok cheers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember what I was</font>

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,870
saying try not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut me off again</font>

7
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:18,119
you're such a brat when they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving</font>

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,039
us their hard-earned money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the idea</font>

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">of hey this is the latest greatest thing</font>

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,939
knowing that in two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not the</font>

11
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,830
latest greatest thing I just thought for

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,859
the value of what people are doing it's

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,529
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's easier and smarter really to</font>

14
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,960
stick with timeless<font color="#CCCCCC"> pallets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you</font>

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,850
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously change that out with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rug</font>

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,040
or with pillows or even paint but when

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,710
it comes to doing super trendy stuff I

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,540
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> think stick with what's classic and</font>

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,160
then you can you can layer with the

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">other things that won't really kill the</font>

21
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:00,000
budget
