this is Thanksgiving Day was the year 1992 they took my dad for pot he never did anything before and they stole him from me and my brother he is missed so many things seasons my 8th grade graduation and plays are things that I was in a high school graduation her dances or prom he is missed all of that my name is Len Cecil my dad is in prison for life for a pot and I want to fight as hard as I can for him to come home to feel like I actually have a family again we shy what's the way to the camera you look back and you just are like wow everything I went through and how scared I was and I should have been up on a pedestal screaming my head off like my dad is gone the first time you hear your dad cry it's you know something's wrong you know it's it just breaks your core craig cecil is an inmate of the federal correction Institute in Terre Haute Indiana Cecil is 58 years old how are you and he's behind bars doing life without parole for pot the more that I learned about his case and the whole situation the more it became clear to me that this was a guy that didn't deserve to be in prison and just how incredibly unjust his the whole situation was and how badly the court system had failed him Cecil has been behind bars since 2002 when the divorced father was suddenly caught up in a marijuana case Drug Enforcement agents tell a story that stretches from Mexico across the highways of Texas to the suburbs of Chicago the DEA claims the truck repairman was actually a marijuana smuggler back here rows of semi trucks and other working trucks to you know fix up for people and how I specifically remember it is because my dad would let us run in the trucks and pull on the horns and until the air all ran out we of course like that cuz it was really nice and loud but Cecil and his daughter Lauren tell a different story about a hard-working truck mechanic framed for a crime he never committed and serving a life sentence he doesn't deserve there's just no doubt in my mind that he wouldn't do anything to affect our lives so my dad went to Texas to get the truck and he was there with his girlfriend and to meet these guys which I've met and the police came and arrested all of them and hauled them all away and it was just an instant thing he repaired trucks and he didn't ask questions Amy PAVA is a former inmate and founder of can do an organization that fights for clemency for nonviolent offenders she's helping Lauren fight for Craig's freedom the feds approached him and said we know that you're repairing these trucks they wanted his help and participation to worm back to the organization and Craig was from my understanding just like that's not my job and I don't really want to get involved in that that's your job when you say no to him a lot of the time it's sort of like okay you know you kind of draw a target on your back Cecil may have been a stand-up guy but his co-defendants were not they all took deals now he's the only man left behind bars Cecil called during our interview with Lauren she asked about the case as everybody else that was involved during that are they all home and there was three more on a separate indictment and the first ones got out after about three years and the last one after ten years and I was phone calls from federal prisons are strictly monitored and are limited 15 minutes a day is all they get I've kept every single letter that he's ever sent me and then I always save pictures and go back from when we were kids says November 9 2002 I spoke with you today and I've cried ever since I thank you and I love you for the support you have given me please I hope you know that I would have never done something like this that would not allow me to be the father I try to be I'm your parent from your dad to kind of bare their soul in a moment is a profound so my dad it took us a Disneyland and Disney World and they were a couple years apart I saved the plane tickets and then I also saved and says Cecil family and it says 327 2010 because it was such a good day it was such a good time and we didn't get to spend that much time with my dad or go on any trips and it was just so special and I loved holding this and being like while I was on the plane with this and and it takes me back to that moment the Cecil family suffered its biggest loss in 2014 when Curtis Lorenz younger brother died after a battle with drug addiction Lauren was forced to give her dad the news over the phone I started off strong for a second and I said there's something that I have to tell you and I said Curtis died and he said Chris which is his sister and the strain in his voice and ice and he said no Curtis sorry and I could just hear him just break he needed help I needed it how we all needed help and he just broke Lauren says her dad filed a special request to attend curtis's funeral it was denied and so everybody had left the wake and my brother's lying there and my dad calls when he said I'm gonna put you on speakerphone so that you can say your goodbyes and I did and they sat there and I just stared at my brother and I just like my dad in jail on the phone my brother's dead why is this happening lauren has found comfort and support from her fiance Brian when they met he joined her fight for Craig's release they make it incredibly hard to undo what has been done no matter how many other attorneys or government officials might say this is completely wrong they still make it next to impossible to undo what they've done to these people and that's very very defeating and it makes you feel very helpless so far 30 states and the District of Columbia have moved to legalize medical marijuana but for Cecil charged under federal law pot remains a crime punishment is life without parole his only hope is clemency from the president that's what Lauren and Brian are focusing on these days the couple plans to marry and they want to be sure Craig is there not on furlough but as a free man I have this terrible fear of getting married and walking down the aisle alone it's very silly a very unconventional person so to have that childhood dream of your father walking you down has always frightened me because I could not have it and I want him to be in this moment that he's a part of it and they think that that would be so powerful and I just can't let it go i I don't know what why and I just you you
