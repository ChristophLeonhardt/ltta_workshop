and we found out a lot of people in Russia are gonna be smiling on the snow today again and know this knows it games but Russia have got Saudi Arabia Egypt and Uruguay they've avoided with huge names that yeah they have it's important for us it is so you might say that Saudi Arabia is an easy opening game it isn't sorry it's not a bad scene but this is an opportunity for Russia there's no doubt about that it could have been you know it could have been England it could have been it could have been Spain really you know it hasn't it's it's now Saudi Arabia so for Russia really really it's a good job I tell you who got a good jaws well England England are in the in with Belgium Panama and Tunisia and they will be loving this they'd be that the British media now they'll be celebrating you know as an English fan this is the worst possible result I have to say from my opinion because what happens and it's the same every World Cup it didn't get a good draw like this they get a few good results and then suddenly the media going to over dry the whole nation believes that they're gonna win the World Cup and then they get knocked out by someone like I so I wanted a tough group where they have to prove themselves this is a bad draw because it's not a soft it's not good no it's it's different now you know you got a different coach who who has a different approach to the media he's not easily sort of thrown a thrown back by them they know they can't control him they've got you know it's a different generation of players it's a really good journey I'm telling you that and the thing is with England it doesn't matter you know what happens the media will always do what the media does that draw their furring then it's fantastic it really is an opportunity to not nothing is easy but to ease himself into the tournament so well done for England yeah and as I understand you got just ahead of the draw to speak to some of the players about their anticipation yeah chanting well there are so obviously you got all the Brazilian stars they're calf wood Ronaldo Ronaldinho and Pelle was else oh and and they're there him you know they think Brazil really have a chance they have they think they have this fantastic team the young team who in many ways learn their lessons in in 2014 that seven one defeat has really helped them and I know this sounds crazy but it's helped them in their sort of maturity development and of course they've got one of the biggest stars in the world Neymar and Neymar you know you got someone like that who even on a day when things are not going for you give him the ball and he can come up with stuff so there they anticipate Brazil's to do really really well in the World Cup and obviously you know Emile our closer who who's presented the trophy today he firmly believes that that Germany they they are the favors and they they have a great chance of the retaining the trophy so you know everyone's a bit positive about the World Cup and in mind you the I was in a group of players from countries that has won the World Cup many times so they are they are fully entitled to to have that kind of confidence
