<font color="#CCCCCC">joining us so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what are your thoughts so</font>

7
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,110
far on the convention<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it's been going</font>

8
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,910
well this is the first convention I've

9
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,410
ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to and we have to understand</font>

10
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,610
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're filming this on the first day</font>

11
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,160
and traditionally the conventions will

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,930
ramp up an excitement and also the

13
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">amount of media attention they get as</font>

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,110
you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the third and fourth day</font>

15
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,700
that's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vice presidential</font>

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,930
candidate will speak the the

17
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,120
presidential candidate and so expect

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,290
that there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more excitement at</font>

19
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,510
that point it's it's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build up</font>

20
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,909
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> but aside from the the</font>

21
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,290
delegates which I haven't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

22
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,450
too much of the outside of the

23
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,710
convention hall there is a lot of

24
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,780
excitement in terms of protests

25
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,180
sanctioned and unsanctioned there are

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,340
vague security threats that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

27
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are worried about groups coming</font>

28
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,060
in and talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that they're</font>

29
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,070
doing open carry and so there's

30
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,260
excitement not necessarily of the sort

31
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,820
that we usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> during convention</font>

32
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,650
absolutely there's there's so much

33
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,270
security here there's so many Secret

34
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,640
Service agents it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

35
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,380
overwhelming but actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody is</font>

36
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">really nice and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it seems like they</font>

37
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,040
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it figured out there's a</font>

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,490
good sense of both professionalism but

39
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,900
it's also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little it's a little loose</font>

40
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,480
yeah look I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think considering the</font>

41
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,070
context of the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> year both in terms</font>

42
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,750
of the recent shootings involving a

43
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,390
police in Baton Rouge and Dallas but

44
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,950
also that the number of violent

45
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,600
incidents that we've had at Donald

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,850
Trump's rallies leading up to this I am

47
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,980
for them going overboard rather than

48
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,840
taking chances we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already had the hall</font>

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,460
was emptied once for a suspicious

50
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,800
package yeah yeah I think that's a good

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think so too and it's it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

52
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,569
nice to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that sort of yeah both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

53
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,099
security but then the efficiency to it

54
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:17,690
doesn't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like slowed down by</font>

55
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,000
bureaucracy and personally for the RNC

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,280
that feels or any National Convention<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

57
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,890
feels like a you know like it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

58
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,569
more uptight<font color="#CCCCCC"> well yeah it's pretty nice</font>

59
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:29,150
have you had a chance to like go around

60
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,170
the convention site at all check out

61
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">cleveland at all not especially around</font>

62
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,110
the convention site<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

63
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,940
little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cleveland we had a fan</font>

64
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,159
meet up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the young turks and it</font>

65
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,959
actually while we're far away from the

66
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,030
east<font color="#CCCCCC"> coast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cleveland it reminds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me a lot</font>

67
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,350
of some of the East Coast cities that I

68
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,480
grew up in the people are super friendly

69
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,020
so

70
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,640
are both the fans and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the people</font>

71
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,100
we've come across and while it's

72
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,460
insanely hot and humid here it's a nice

73
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,680
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> too big city first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time in Cleveland</font>

74
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,540
but I'm liking<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so far same it is also</font>

75
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,880
my first time in Cleveland and exactly

76
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same it's it's super it's a really</font>

77
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,940
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> vibe I didn't expect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

78
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,410
from Cleveland I expected Cleveland to

79
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,620
be um maybe a little louder I would say

80
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,120
I thought to be a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more like Chicago</font>

81
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,220
yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very different than from San</font>

82
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,110
francisco-based definitely very

83
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,030
different from San Francisco a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of a</font>

84
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,550
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new things happening around me</font>

85
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,340
but very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i love what we've</font>

86
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,780
stayed and it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool that the</font>

87
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,190
convention is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cleveland because this</font>

88
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,890
isn't the first time that the republican

89
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,790
national convention has been in

90
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,370
Cleveland it's the time and you know

91
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,560
Ohio is a huge swing state that doesn't

92
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,560
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> super surprising but it's it's</font>

93
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,480
pretty cool the first one was nineteen

94
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty-four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next one was nineteen</font>

95
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,400
thirty-six and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changed since</font>

96
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,100
then it's it's pretty interesting how

97
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,530
the role of conventions has changed in

98
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,660
general yeah you know it used to be a

99
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,459
bunch of old<font color="#E5E5E5"> white guys with cigars</font>

100
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:54,920
would crowd up in a room and talk about

101
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh who you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know who do they want as</font>

102
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,790
their nominee and there'll be all these

103
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,250
back deal like backroom deals and all

104
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,970
these uh you know secret shady shady

105
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,590
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> going ago she ation shady</font>

106
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">negotiations yeah there's no cigars</font>

107
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,430
anymore there's still old white men but

108
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,959
now they're wiping that's it that's

109
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">actively they they ban these cigarettes</font>

110
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,040
from the inside of the convention i

111
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,529
noticed that specifically yeah um but

112
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:21,350
yeah like like e cigarettes so much has

113
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,360
changed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the biggest</font>

114
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,190
things is that the purpose of the

115
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,540
convention has changed because

116
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,030
originally it was you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know to choose the</font>

117
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,220
nominee to set the platform and to

118
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,470
establish the rules for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next the</font>

119
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,230
next election cycle but choosing the

120
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,390
nominee isn't it's a completely

121
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">different system now you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> instead of</font>

122
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,919
it being all these backroom dealings we

123
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,130
have primaries and caucuses and so you

124
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,110
know everybody by the end of the primary

125
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,030
season everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows who the nominee</font>

126
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:50,960
is going to be that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been that way</font>

127
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,320
since the 1970s when every state

128
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,090
basically had taken on a caucus or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

129
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,890
primary system yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the last</font>

130
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,810
time

131
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,419
that it was even questionable was the

132
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:04,990
was in 1976 between Ronald Reagan and

133
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,020
Gerald Ford where it was too close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

134
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,790
call I believe neither them have reached

135
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,550
the 1,237 delegates exactly necessary

136
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,570
and so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a nervous I could actually</font>

137
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,190
contested convention I believe at the

138
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,540
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> because more of a theoretically</font>

139
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,310
contestant yet but it was so close and

140
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,980
it's never<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that close since then</font>

141
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">well it's one of the reasons that we had</font>

142
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:26,950
so much excitement<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the media in the</font>

143
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,810
Republican primary leading up to today

144
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,730
because it seemed for a while like we

145
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,800
might finally have some actual drama

146
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,810
some some important decisions be made at

147
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,400
the convention hall<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet be mostly</font>

148
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,840
avoided though that although there was a

149
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,090
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of drama from the nevertrump group</font>

150
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,100
today doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's amounted to</font>

151
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,720
anything yet it's it seems like it's

152
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,460
still going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a fairly calm day and</font>

153
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,290
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's super interesting also</font>

154
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Trump is a really big example of</font>

155
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,160
how um political elites don't control

156
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,410
who becomes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nominee anymore because</font>

157
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,940
that's been a huge there's a huge outcry

158
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,560
against Trump the entirety of his

159
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,530
campaign and you know the Republican

160
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,720
voters have definitively spoken for who

161
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,610
they want as their nominee yeah and

162
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,430
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone</font>

163
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,890
higher up has really been able to do or

164
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,919
maybe wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do but it's pretty</font>

165
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:17,650
fascinating yeah and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that so</font>

166
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,780
we know who the nominee is going to be

167
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,130
when we're coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the convention</font>

168
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,289
yeah so it kind of begs the question why

169
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:24,940
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the convention why are there</font>

170
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,010
twenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> five hundred delegates I think</font>

171
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">fifty thousand attendees 15,000 media</font>

172
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,410
people yeah it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a lot for when</font>

173
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,910
we know what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> solution is or with the</font>

174
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,919
anti-base yeah and so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for</font>

175
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,210
gathering is very different than<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

176
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,710
historically but there are at least two

177
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,240
good reasons that they still do it the

178
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">the smaller less important of the two</font>

179
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:44,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons is it's a massive amount of</font>

180
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,320
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> free media for your party for</font>

181
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,300
your candidate it puts the eyes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

182
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,970
country on your party for four to seven

183
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,830
days depending on how much drama<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

184
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,960
expected and that's worth something it

185
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,760
both gives your candidate and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the VP</font>

186
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,580
candidate a lot of exposure but also in

187
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,169
the instances in which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have sort of</font>

188
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:04,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> up-and-coming stars of the party it</font>

189
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,100
gives a huge spotlight on them i<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

190
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,900
that's where Barack Obama basically saw

191
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,020
his national

192
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">launched into the spotlight was it the</font>

193
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,099
2004 convention and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if there's</font>

194
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,780
no doubt about who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be the</font>

195
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,610
nominee that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of attention on</font>

196
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,349
the speeches and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the platform is</font>

197
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:20,990
valuable and that's the second reason

198
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,419
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the platform and so while it's</font>

199
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:25,639
easy to to laugh at the platform as a

200
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,590
sort of outdated listing of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

201
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,870
priorities of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the party um getting</font>

202
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">together thousands of delegates and</font>

203
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,250
especially the Leadership Council to

204
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,139
agree on the priorities of the party to

205
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:37,580
put it together<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a document that</font>

206
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,889
people can refer back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to uh that's</font>

207
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:41,900
important and it's non-binding they

208
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,020
don't have to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I on them I think</font>

209
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,030
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like kind of amazing is that it</font>

210
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,060
it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know really big deal is made of</font>

211
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,340
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> platform and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by the way I love that</font>

212
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,380
the individual parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the platform are</font>

213
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,440
called planks I know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just let so cute</font>

214
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,840
see ya political idea silly but I want

215
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,360
as much pirate as I can get money so

216
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,190
into an<font color="#E5E5E5"> RN C exam yeah but so uh it is</font>

217
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,449
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is interesting that it's non-binding</font>

218
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:10,849
because of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much attention is placed</font>

219
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:12,379
on it yeah I think that's that's kind of

220
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:13,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">fascinating but we were talking a little</font>

221
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,990
earlier and you tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

222
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,639
didn't know which is most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font>

223
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,199
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are promised even though they are</font>

224
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,740
non-binding go through yeah yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

225
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was reading up on the political</font>

226
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">science research that's been done on</font>

227
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,360
party primaries the presidential

228
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,330
primaries especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the state</font>

229
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,440
platforms are less important and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

230
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,789
generally like if you ever read<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

231
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:34,640
state platform<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just wish lists of</font>

232
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,130
crazy extremists policies but the

233
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,049
presidential platform generally is a

234
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,940
more moderate document<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's more</font>

235
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,828
attainable goals and political

236
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:43,940
scientists have found that over the past

237
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,579
three decades depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> which party</font>

238
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:47,990
you're talking about the Republican

239
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,170
Party generally acts on stated promises

240
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,420
about ninety percent of the time ninety

241
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent of the promises Democratic</font>

242
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:56,060
Party's a little bit lower below eighty

243
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,890
percent but that's still significant

244
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that means that you can read that</font>

245
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,220
platform and get an idea for what the

246
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,660
priorities of the party actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

247
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,940
mm-hmm and if you'd like just a few

248
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,560
examples that the platform is still

249
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,959
being worked on on the Republican side

250
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:09,860
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually one of the first things</font>

251
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,089
that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be accomplished in the first</font>

252
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:13,160
and second days is finalizing it but

253
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,600
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like overturning gay</font>

254
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,209
marriage allowing for conversion therapy

255
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:20,149
for parents of gay youths across the

256
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:22,730
country again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm changing up</font>

257
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,170
energy goals of the country they

258
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,449
described coal as clean energy in their

259
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:29,360
platform uh there's definitely uh move

260
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,220
towards more tax cuts they<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

261
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the economic stimulus they think</font>

262
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,120
will come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from both making permanent</font>

263
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,389
previous tax cuts instituting new ones

264
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:39,709
banning women from combat roles in the

265
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:43,579
military pushing for a balanced budget

266
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,380
and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think very interestingly</font>

267
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,870
repealing glass-steagall which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

268
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,300
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Democratic platform although it's</font>

269
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">not something that Hillary Clinton has</font>

270
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,959
pushed for which I see that both parties

271
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,399
right now what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting</font>

272
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,980
about that is that not only is Clinton a

273
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,660
little bit at odds with her platform but

274
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,220
the this platform is pretty at odds with

275
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,170
Trump because Trump in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways he</font>

276
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,540
doesn't have a lot of really distinct

277
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,730
policy positions yeah he kind of seems

278
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,339
to say the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> he thinks and that</font>

279
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:12,290
becomes his policy yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

280
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,260
actually noticed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some of the talk</font>

281
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,510
on policy it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they're using</font>

282
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,790
just clips from you know something he

283
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,260
kind of said in his speech and have

284
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,269
introduced that as a positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> laughs</font>

285
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:26,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah but uh i was reading</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that quite a</font>

286
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,370
bit of the platform isn't really in line

287
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,040
with a like I know Trump has said that

288
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,810
he's not that interested in overturning

289
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,060
gay marriage that the piezo he's not as

290
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,480
LGBT unfriendly a lot of past candidates

291
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,680
are certainly not as much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

292
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,540
platform is there are a couple areas of

293
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,610
the platform that do basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> tow the</font>

294
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,500
Trump line first of all the language

295
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,209
it's all american exceptionalism make

296
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:48,889
America great again so his rhetoric is

297
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,130
there but also building<font color="#E5E5E5"> a border wall</font>

298
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,139
banning uh immigration from countries

299
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:56,420
that are associated with terrorism yeah

300
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,040
those are two of<font color="#CCCCCC"> his biggest policy</font>

301
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,290
priorities<font color="#CCCCCC"> there there and while it</font>

302
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,350
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far on being against trade</font>

303
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,790
deals as he's been in some of the

304
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,310
debates recently it is a more anti trade

305
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,139
platform than the Republicans have had

306
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:11,060
in quite a few decades yeah I've

307
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,649
definitely definitely noticed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

308
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:14,990
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happens uh you're saying within</font>

309
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,610
the first couple of days right yeah this

310
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,819
is this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> four day convention you</font>

311
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:22,610
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the beginning the first two days</font>

312
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">seem a little bit looser yeah the next</font>

313
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,079
to um you know what what happens during

314
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:29,300
those days well in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first two days</font>

315
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to have a lot of speakers</font>

316
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">they are the less high-profile speakers</font>

317
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,760
at least at this convention although we

318
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,350
expect Michelle Obama on the first

319
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,090
a of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Democratic convention but then</font>

320
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,770
there's also it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about</font>

321
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,690
choosing the present this is the biggest

322
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,370
gathering of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> party that you'll have</font>

323
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,290
for four years and so they take care a

324
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,020
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of routine party business as you</font>

325
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">said earlier they have to lay out at</font>

326
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">least some of the broad strokes of how</font>

327
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,120
the presidential election of<font color="#E5E5E5"> go for the</font>

328
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,340
party in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next four years and that</font>

329
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,080
will be fine-tuned over the course of a

330
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,600
few years<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the base is set here um</font>

331
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,850
that you have thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> delegates</font>

332
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,950
they have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> checked in make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

333
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,180
that they're the people they say they

334
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,620
are there's going to be various votes

335
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,080
that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be involved in and</font>

336
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,850
then you have as i said the formal

337
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,380
adoption of the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> platform the</font>

338
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,690
finalized platform so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of a</font>

339
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,260
seemingly procedural use that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

340
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,550
of established the base what are we

341
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,570
going to do next year what are we gonna

342
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,940
do this year yeah days three and four

343
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,020
get a little bit more exciting though

344
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,050
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i well my favorite thing i love day</font>

345
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,380
34<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the day that the all</font>

346
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the states really it's a call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to roll</font>

347
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,190
call it's actually specific called a

348
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,140
rolling roll call of the states which is

349
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,740
really fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say where every state and</font>

350
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,830
all the territories will give up well

351
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,420
first I'll say something very nice about

352
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">thursday which i learned is called</font>

353
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,080
boosterism which is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> another fun</font>

354
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,440
word for posting your own state and then

355
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,120
and it always goes alphabetically it

356
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,480
goes alabama first<font color="#E5E5E5"> wyoming last and so</font>

357
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,060
every every state spokesperson will

358
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,620
stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up say something really nice about</font>

359
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,810
their state then they'll announce their

360
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,850
delicate count or pass in which case

361
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,480
it'll come back around to them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

362
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,460
think what's again<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's super</font>

363
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,070
interesting is for for as much sort of

364
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,630
pomp and circumstance that goes with it

365
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,150
we know all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the delegates</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know who's</font>

366
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,390
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to win and realistically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind</font>

367
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:24,110
of leaves uh you know it's it really

368
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">becomes a ceremonial practice as silly</font>

369
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,110
as it is i still like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that part of it</font>

370
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,340
though I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately it's not</font>

371
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,750
going to be like the most recent season

372
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,910
of house of cards not that exciting but

373
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,430
it's so old timey it's like politics of

374
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,830
a previous century yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we very</font>

375
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,590
rarely see<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big gathering of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font>

376
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,260
pride on display for multiple states and

377
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,540
it's got the boosterism is endearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

378
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,660
think it reminds us that

379
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,760
we are a country and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are unified we</font>

380
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,470
have our own culture and we have our own

381
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,090
way of doing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> state to state it's</font>

382
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,470
nice to see that on display at least in

383
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,530
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> form by the way I love that and</font>

384
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,330
maybe this is obvious but it's like I

385
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">said it's not just the states</font>

386
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,420
territories to and we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to the</font>

387
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,460
floor yesterday and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

388
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,620
being caught so off guard by seeing uh

389
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,350
you know it completely exactly like all

390
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,700
the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them a stand for the</font>

391
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,590
northern Marshall Islands yeah I was

392
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,480
kind of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> wow I have not heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

393
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,610
them for so long but of course here they

394
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,560
are and they're represented and they get

395
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,120
to be a part of the nomination process

396
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,860
which i think is super cool a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

397
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,540
times they get cut out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

398
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,370
everything american samoa<font color="#CCCCCC"> and those</font>

399
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,870
sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> is yeah a Puerto Rico</font>

400
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,150
it's a walled off from the rest but they

401
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,290
allowed them in the building which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

402
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,820
nice they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so um that's</font>

403
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,350
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> three that's the roll call at the</font>

404
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,800
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that you know that ends with</font>

405
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,870
everybody being officially knowing Trump

406
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,890
is in yeah um the fourth day is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1i I</font>

407
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,480
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm actually most excited for</font>

408
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,240
that's this that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest speeches</font>

409
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,220
that's the last day and that's when we

410
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,260
get to hear what Trump has to say which

411
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,680
he he said that I believe he said us

412
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,180
about the last convention it was the

413
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,770
single most boring convention he had

414
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,750
ever seen and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> plans to bring some</font>

415
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,650
showbiz to this one I the guy is a full

416
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,380
of surprises and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am so excited to see</font>

417
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,980
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah showbiz he brings we got a</font>

418
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,660
sample of it before the convention it

419
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,370
had been announced that he wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly</font>

420
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,560
in a helicopter I'd which is actually

421
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of a cool idea they're not gonna do</font>

422
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,520
that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking maybe he rides in on a</font>

423
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,770
tiger I'm not sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be very</font>

424
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,620
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> truck yeah but I do think that his</font>

425
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,120
speech will be incredibly consequential

426
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,100
because we're gonna have to see does he

427
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">do one of his normal rambling 45 minute</font>

428
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,300
speeches of whatever pops into his head

429
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,110
or does he do a teleprompter yes

430
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,150
scripted speech he's had very few of

431
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,760
those so far that would signal something

432
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">if he were to do that if he were to lay</font>

433
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,210
out specifics<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not expecting that</font>

434
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,860
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that but there is the</font>

435
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,800
chance that he will<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I've noticed and</font>

436
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,750
I've read this around that in the last

437
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,500
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> months his rhetoric has calmed down</font>

438
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,320
a little maybe not the substance but the

439
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,400
way he's delivering it

440
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,500
still giving fiery speeches but i

441
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,020
believe uh just after he let<font color="#CCCCCC"> go of his</font>

442
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,990
campaign manager he took<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what what</font>

443
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,340
has been described as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think a more</font>

444
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,790
presidential presence yeah which is

445
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,560
maybe a little strange to see from

446
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,440
trumpets it's again a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little unexpected</font>

447
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,730
there has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a movement that i've</font>

448
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">noticed and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i especially gave him credit</font>

449
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,020
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wake of the the police shooting</font>

450
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,000
the ambush in<font color="#E5E5E5"> dallas he didn't take</font>

451
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,680
advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it the way that you might</font>

452
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,120
have predicted based on his earlier

453
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">behavior</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah however after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> baton rouge</font>

00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,290
she says that obama has blood on his

hands and that he's leading a war on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

456
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,840
yeah uh he says that obama is supporting

457
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,840
Islamic terrorism uh he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was recently</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

458
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,340
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for claiming that a</font>

460
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,320
descent couldn't be objective in a case

461
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,720
involving Trump and so there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still</font>

462
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,760
reason to believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not fully</font>

463
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,740
capable of reeling at all yeah but he

464
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,600
does seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be trying no I'm sure I'm</font>

465
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that the the deep down believes the</font>

466
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,030
the basic the basic fuel that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

467
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,770
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> on is still the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah but I</font>

468
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">think his delivery has become a little</font>

469
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,760
more subdued so I am also super curious

470
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,680
to see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of speech this is yes</font>

471
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,619
um also<font color="#E5E5E5"> really fast super important um</font>

472
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,390
he is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be and I don't think this</font>

473
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,130
is generally the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way it's done he's</font>

474
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,630
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be introducing some of the</font>

475
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,950
other speakers<font color="#E5E5E5"> throughout the week so</font>

476
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,000
I've heard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's going to be</font>

477
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,920
introducing Melania tonight yeah it's

478
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,780
also expected he's going to introduce uh

479
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,500
his uh VP candidate pence on Thursday

480
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,470
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so those are probably not likely to</font>

481
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,910
be scripted and so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get a</font>

482
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,140
taste to build from during those

483
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,210
introduction speeches totally actually

484
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,640
speaking of<font color="#E5E5E5"> which we I actually saw</font>

485
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,860
Tweety you did a little earlier that you

486
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,300
said you weren't that excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

487
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,330
seeing the speeches today yeah um but

488
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,460
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you excited about I'm excited</font>

489
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,780
about some look honestly I'm a little

490
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,460
bit excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about seeing Melania Trump</font>

491
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,700
speak we've had almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> no exposure of</font>

492
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,500
her and she is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the people who for</font>

493
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,420
better or worse knows Trump best at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

494
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,730
point and look I fully expected her

495
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,950
speech is going to be incredibly tightly

496
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,530
controlled but maybe she will attempt to

497
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,720
humanize her husband maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> she'll even</font>

498
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,940
be capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing that and so I'm</font>

499
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,970
interested to see her um there's some be

500
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,770
actors from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 80s that they got on</font>

501
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,110
display that I think Antonio sabato jr.

502
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,670
it's gonna be your scalp a red<font color="#E5E5E5"> scott</font>

503
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">baio that was ya they waitin all over</font>

504
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter I I feel like that came so out</font>

505
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,380
of left field hoodoos you just got my

506
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,790
office yeah look he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> great in</font>

507
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,990
arrested development maybe he'll be

508
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,880
right at the convention and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm honestly</font>

509
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,340
actually excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see Ted Cruz yes Ted</font>

510
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,290
Cruz has been an interesting character

511
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,820
after he dropped out of the race he's

512
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,950
sort of endorsed Donald Trump but not

513
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,320
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> so is he actually going to lay</font>

514
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,030
out why Trump should be President or is

515
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,340
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply going to boost conservatism</font>

516
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,100
generally and he's a relatively serious

517
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,809
guy in this bunch and so I think that's

518
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:51,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">a speech to watch I I think that's</font>

519
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,200
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> super interesting that Ted Cruz</font>

520
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,030
is speaking because of how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

521
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">have outright refused to speak or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

522
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,160
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to the convention at all um I</font>

523
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,400
i saw that<font color="#CCCCCC"> mitt romney john mccain and</font>

524
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,679
both of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the living bush presidents are</font>

525
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,650
our former presidents have refused to

526
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if they if that's</font>

527
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,840
still true if they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold to</font>

528
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,850
that but i don't think mitt romney's

529
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,320
gonna get to see mitt romney their

530
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,230
fights<font color="#E5E5E5"> not having living presidents of</font>

531
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,390
your party speak out for you that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

532
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way things generally happen in the</font>

533
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,190
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> tree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it but it's also so on on</font>

534
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,440
message for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Republican Party right</font>

535
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">now wishes from yeah yeah exactly with</font>

536
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,760
Trump where the highest level

537
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,620
establishment still seems even reluctant

538
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,540
to accept him as the nominee even though

539
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,679
you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk around the convention</font>

540
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,840
hall and it's Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pence Flyers</font>

541
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,250
everywhere yeah which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> another really</font>

542
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,080
hilarious thing for the you know the

543
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,220
convention where they're supposed to

544
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,140
choose the nominee that's clearly chosen

545
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,840
yeah it's another fun little like relic

546
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,940
and importantly we don't have John

547
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,919
Kasich expected to speak now he's the

548
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:52,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">governor of the state the convention is</font>

549
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,370
in he's a relatively high profile

550
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,809
Republican<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of his relative</font>

551
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:57,970
success during the primary and this is a

552
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,919
swing state you'd want the governor to

553
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,200
speak for you but he is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> having not</font>

554
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,640
endorsing Trump that's right now I mean

555
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,760
that's a huge deal I you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I brought</font>

556
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">this a little earlier but Ohio as a</font>

557
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,010
swing state is a gigantic it's

558
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,960
