1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,120
After the end of the Korean war, North Korea
was a virtually cashless society - everyone

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,719
worked for the state and was provided for
by the state.

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:15,799
And in the Communist bloc context of the day,
it worked - in 1989 North Koreans were more

4
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:18,410
than twice as wealthy as their comrades in
China.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,640
Now we think of them as a hermit kingdom and
not trading very much.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,170
William Brown spent his career analyzing North
Korea for the CIA.

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:33,510
But actually they were integrated reasonably
well into the Soviet plan system of countries.

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,399
The loss of support from the Soviet Union,
after its collapse in 1991, and a series of

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,460
droughts and floods lead to a great famine
in North Korea.

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:50,220
The famine pretty much ended the public distribution system in which the North Korean state

11
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,940
fed everybody through the ration system… the government couldn’t supply food

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,000
so people launched off on their own.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,469
Since then, a strange hybrid economy has emerged,
part government-controlled - where rations

14
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:07,500
are allocated by the state - and part grey
market, where currency

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,880
is earned in the market economy.

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,030
For example: A typical textile worker in the
state-run Pyongyang textile mill earns around

17
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,880
3,000 won per month - which has a street value
of about 40 cents.

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,680
But that worker pays nothing for housing or
utilities and receives food rations.

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,260
Her sister might legally work for an export
oriented company.

20
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,280
She’s allowed to get 30,000 won per month
but with fewer perks.

21
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:37,549
Another sister could work for a Chinese company
and earn 300,000 won per month but with zero

22
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:38,880
perks from the government.

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,020
All the state workers get paid through this
incredibly low wage system and are dependent

24
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,189
on rations that often don't show up.

25
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:54,350
The ideal situation is for one person in a
family to work for the state system and then other

26
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,229
people in the family work out in the market place and earn real money.

27
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,619
It is a highly inefficient system.

28
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,119
In per capita income terms, North Koreans
are now 8 times poorer than Chinese and over

29
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,750
20 times as poor as South Koreans.

30
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,790
Rather than reform, the government sought
to fill a shortfall in hard currency by trafficking

31
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,460
illegal goods abroad.

32
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,960
According to numerous reports, this illegal
business is run by an agency known as Office 39

33
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:29,260
It's an office that's organized principally
to raise US dollars for the ruling Kim party

34
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,640
A study from a Washington-based human rights
group traces the regime’s criminal ventures

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,140
back to the 1970s when about a dozen North
Korean diplomats were expelled from Scandinavian

36
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,099
countries for smuggling alcohol, cigarettes,
and hashish.

37
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,890
Later the government switched to foreign organized
crime syndicates to sell things like counterfeit

38
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,769
pharmaceuticals and heroin, manufactured from
state-mandated poppy farms.

39
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,620
North Korea’s government has dismissed such
claims and some analysts

40
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,600
have also questioned the data.

41
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,720
Since 2005, intercepts of North Korean smuggling
have fallen sharply… though more recently

42
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,939
claims of cyber theft have proliferated.

43
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:12,610
Meanwhile Kim Jong Un has started speaking
to South Korea about opening up for investment

44
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:18,460
in restricted economic zones and he’s also talking
about switching to a more China-like economic system.

45
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,860
Whether that's a true change of heart, or
just a tactical retreat in the face of sanctions

46
00:03:22,860 --> 00:00:00,000
remains to be seen.
