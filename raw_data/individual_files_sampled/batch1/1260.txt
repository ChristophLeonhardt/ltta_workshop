North Korea has been targeted with tougher and tougher sanctions by the US and the international community Ave what persuaded the country's leadership to pursue a diplomatic course and what effect are they having on ordinary people in this isolated country we've been taken to a department store in the center of Pyongyang despite the international sanctions the shelves here are full we managed to visit a number of shops in the city centre all were up marketplaces catering to the elite we found no shortages and luxury items like chocolates and bottles of alcohol that were clearly smuggled in in defiance of the sanctions the official line is that foreign imports have been replaced by increased domestic production I don't know why others around us are starving us dear reporter when you return please tell them we are indomitable no matter what sanctions are upon us the only medical facility we were taken to was a gleaming new eye hospital most of the equipment here was imported clearly a problem in the future when spare parts become needed we were shown the eyeglasses which has subsidized for North Korean citizens what's the name of the North Korean brand not yet a recent UN report says the humanitarian situation particularly in rural areas outside the capital is poor before traveling to North Korea I spoke to the UN's top humanitarian official in New York there's a nutrition problem lots of malnourished children especially there are too many women having really hard time too often dying in childbirth it's the UN Security Council that voted in the international sanctions and the Netherlands is the council member that administers them all resolutions there's a very clear passage where it says these sanctions are not meant to have adverse negative effects on the people of DPRK that's the official line privately even Western diplomats will tell you there's a stigma to donating humanitarian aid to North Korea for example an important program by the NGO the Global Fund to fight malaria and tuberculosis was cut earlier this year sanctions are having an effect in North Korea but perhaps not the one the international community wanted James BAE's al Jazeera Pyongyang
