thing one tonight Donald Trump has been obsessed with so-called chain migration what many consider an offensive way to refer to America's family reunification immigration policy it allows a citizen to sponsor their spouse children parents or siblings for immigration to the US Trump talks about ending that policy a lot we need to end chain migration ending chain migration and canceling the visa lottery we will get rid of chain migration I started talking about chain migration chain migration migration chain migration is one of the disasters chain migration is a disaster disaster a total disaster we have to end chain migration we have to end chain migrate so he talks about a lot now ending family reunification has long been pushed by immigration hardliners like Stephen Miller and Jeff Sessions but we learn something today that makes you think it might just be a super passive-aggressive move against his in-laws and that's thing too in 60 seconds Washington Post has been asking a simple question the White House has refused to answer what is the immigration status of the first lady's parents milania's parents are from Slovenia but have been living in America for at least a decade joining their daughter after she moved here today the post got an answer Victor and Amalia knobs are legal permanent residents are not close to obtaining their citizenship but their attorney declined to say how or when the couple gained their green cards so the post spoke to immigration lawyers and it's really likely that Melania sponsored her parents which she can do under wait for it America's family reunification policy or as Trump likes to call it chain migration David Leopold an immigration lawyer and past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said the first lady's sponsorship of her parents appears to be the only reasonable way they could have obtained green cards which means if a lot of these parents are here because of what Trump says is chain migration then this isn't a very nice way to talk about your in-laws in public chain migration is bringing in many many people with one and often it doesn't work out very well those many people are not doing us right hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
