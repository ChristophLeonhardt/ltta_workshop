now you talked about the cities that have pulled out and I'm very scared about this and I'm scared because the the crowd is starting to thin Stockholm Sweden is still in the running our rum Turkey I don't know if I'm saying that right and there's still a three-way bid from three cities in Italy I'm worried that we're going to actually get this Olympics I'm very scared yes the Olympics that no one wants could end up in Calgary if every other bid city drops out because of the incredible cost of hosting you know cost and extravagance of hosting these Olympics the IOC in their response to you know every bid City dropping out offers this condescending well it's so sad for you host city host country that you'll be missing out on these great things and and it's a shame that your athletes won't be able to win gold in their home country and it comes across as as like if you don't get the Olympics somehow life just can't go on for you and your city and your country now the reality is the IOC themselves quite worried about this they've actually asked Salt Lake City to standby for an alternate venue in 2026 if they can't get a host city for this Olympics so I mean obviously some city is going to take the Olympics when if it went a bit happens it could be one of the spin cities for twenty five six but the IOC is gonna make sure it goes on certainly they're not prepared to give up their there two year you know every two year like Cherie vacation on our tax dollars so they're already talking to Salt Lake City to see if they can pick up the slack if no casually ends up bidding for the 2020 six Olympics poor Salt Lake City drawing the short straw on the Olympics that's an excerpt from my weekly full-length show the gun show on my show I take on the issues of the day through my Alberta conservative lens and I talked to the real news makers the mainstream media ignores to get access to my show in all of our other premium content click the link on the screen to subscribe today you
