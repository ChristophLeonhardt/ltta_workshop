geopolitically plays between east and west turkey plays a hugely important and strategic role many of the region's crises and conflicts not to mention developments around the world under Malachi Al and Ankara this week I'll be speaking to the Turkish Foreign Minister who'll be answering questions about the ongoing war in Syria the GCC crisis and the fallout from u.s. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize occupied Jerusalem as the capital of Israel all of this as marucho Shaw who talks to Al Jazeera mr. Charles over you thank you very much for talking to Al Jazeera let's start by talking about the war in Syria your country is in the middle of a military operation now inside Syria an operation you've called Operation olive branch now this is the second such operation and just the same amount of years before that there was the Euphrates shield operation what is the endgame of your military intervention inside Syria during the operation Euphrates shield we will defeating - terrorists there are different terrorist groups in the country and it was a very successful operation it became a kind of safe zone for the refugees and IDPs and we are supporting them in that area as well and there have been YPG PKK terrorists in Afrin region and they were sending harassment files and the rockets to Turkey the different part of Turkey and it became a serious threat to our security and also to our borders we warned them we want the countries who have been engaged with them nevertheless they increased the harassment fires that's why we launched this operation and it is in the line with the international law and also UN charters as well as related UN Security Council but your critics say that Turkey is essentially invading Syria that you want to occupy Syrian land and annex it as part of some sort of larger expansive project and it's not your intention just to there is no there is no other country in the region or beyond supporting serious territorial integrity and sovereignty more than Turkey and even in Sochi and also in Astana in Moscow if you look at all these statements and the joint declarations you see that and we are for unity and territorial integrity of the country well on the ypg in the the Kurdish fighters their video has emerged recently showing american-made weapons that has been captured from these Kurdish fighters by the FSA now these YPG fighters and their allies have not only been fighting you or you have not only been fighting them inside Syria but they've been firing rockets inside Turkey which has led to six civilians being killed can you explain to me how it is that turkey still considers the United States as an ally if it is the United States that has made no secret of its support for Kurdish fighters who are essentially killing your own civilians how how are they considered to be an ally they're not captured weapons those weapons have been given by the United States to YPG so we have actually asked the United States not to give the weapons they did we asked them to stop and President Trump promised our Dogon - that they will stop giving weapons to this organization and at the last phone conversation between two presidents President Trump told everyone that they stopped they have stopped giving weapons to this organization these rockets these weapons used by YPG and PKK you know most of them are given by the United States but there are also weapons coming from different European countries Western countries as well from other countries but the US State Department has said that it still considers the YPG as an ally in the fight against ISIL or - and this is my question I mean okay now you're saying there's verbal commitment from the US that they will stop or they have stopped supplying weapons but in the end of the day the US and Turkey are meant to be NATO allies in the end of the day the US make use of Turkish Air Base Incirlik airbase why why have you not been more forceful in making the u.s. truce between its ally and between a group that you consider to be a double standard particularly in our fight terrorism we see this double standard everywhere in the United States in the United States even then Secretary of Defense Carter and also the current chief of general staff comfort admit it yeah and still they still admit that there is no difference between PKK and YPG if there is no difference that I had you admit it means that both of them are terrorist organization this is the double standard in Europe also many political parties politicians and even some countries are supporting PKK even PKK which is listed by European Union as well just because they share the same ideology Marxist communist lens ideology so this is unfortunately the criteria for many different political parties and the politicians and the countries and how can we defeat terrorists with this understanding and with those kind of double standards this is not only problem of the US which is very serious the u.s. is pioneering in the wall that they are fighting or all sort of terrorist organization in the world but in Syria they are collaborating with a terrorist organization we will come back to Turkish US relations near the end but I just won't ask another question about Syria here now the war has gone on for seven years almost up to a million people have been killed more than five million refugees now your government has always said that it supports the Syrian people's right to freedom and it supports their quest for for for democracy there you not only have you you said that in statements but you host more than three million refugees inside Turkey but now it seems that you according to some of your critics that you no longer care about the Syrian struggle for freedom because for example Aleppo which was held by the rebels essentially fell into the hands of the rich Assad regime because Turkey stopped supporting the rebels there and similar scenes in other places inside Syria your critics say that you are more concerned about the success of the Astana Genda and more concerned about maybe appeasing your newfound relationship with russia and iran then you are with the syrians they accuse you some of the syrian rebels of selling out I don't see any opposition any Syrian groups accusing for turkey I we know that some neighboring countries are not happy with the role that Turkey has been playing and we were only the country actually helped who helped those civilians and the Opposition in to advocate them from Aleppo and we work with Russia and Russia actually delivered what they promised but sorry they evacuated them from Aleppo when did they go to Italy Italy it slip started being bombed from the sky it's true it's true there are violations I don't ignore that but it doesn't mean that Turkey has changed or because Turkey has changed his position and the opposition high negotiations committee and Syrian National Committee Syrian national Kurdish committee and others they all know that only Turkey has not changed its standing and its position and its support to opposition what is the aim of the Astana what is the aim of the search east what is the outcome of the Sochi the aim of the Sochi actually to take to some confidence-building measures or steps okay also to consolidate the ceasefire and the escalation zones and cessation of the hostilities yes there are some violations in Italy and we asked the guarantors of the regime to stop that because they are the guarantors I would like to ask a question the situation and the current isn't it better than a year a year and a half ago the situation a year and half ago before Aleppo and during Aleppo now we are very much disturbed with these violations and this is the legitimate concerns of everybody including the opposition and the civilians living there and now we are deploying observe look at the outcome of the Sochi and everybody actually welcomed the outcome of the Sochi and we have been doing our best to integrate Aston a process and Sochi process to Geneva and if you look at the joint declaration in Sochi it is referring the Geneva process it is referring the UN Security resolution to two five four and from now those meetings will be held in Geneva and we help them also to establish a committee or working group on the Constitution we have given the list to demonstra and then the demonstra will form this committee or working group so all these efforts are helping us and the Syrians actually to proceed and to reach a political settlement without a political settlement any achievements on the ground cannot be sustained cannot be consolidated so we have to focus on both sides okay Astana and the political process okay let's move on to another hot topic in the region and that is Jerusalem or illegally occupied Jerusalem as the United Nations considers it to be president worship type everyone warned that if the United States went ahead and considered or acknowledged and recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel that Turkey would cut its ties with Israel what is the status of relationship between Turkey and Israel now that this decisions we made three enormous our relations with Israel and we put three conditions they met all these three conditions yes after that and when we were normalizing they asked whether turkey will continue criticizing Israel we said yes if Israel Wireless the international law and if they continue illegal settlements as well as attacking Palestinians in Gaza or West Bank turkey would be against that and Turkey will criticize Israel so normalizing the relation doesn't mean that we admit what Israel is doing or what Israel will do and last June you remember what happened in el coche in Jerusalem and president Erdogan called President of Israel we asked him to stop it and we stood very strong all together and they did stop it now it is the decision of the United States and you saw how they were isolated in New York at UN so the entire world rejected the decision of the United States and at the Security Council also so these we will continue our efforts all together not only as turkey of course turkey is leading this role particularly in the Muslim world because we are the Samba share of the organizers I see but I just want to ask you one thing this specifically this threat that the president made that turkey would cut off ties with Israel if Trump recognizes Jerusalem is the capital don't President Erdogan made this statement after the decision of the United States that before the decision but still the resources if if there is still relation and we have the embassies here but if this situation I mean becomes more in the future and if Israel continues violation the status of the East Jerusalem and Al codes of course we should all together review our position and also our relation okay on the OIC that is the organization of summit conferences which is the umbrella body of Muslim countries directly hosted an extraordinary summit right after that decision took place in in Jerusalem in in Istanbul rather the summit at the start of that summit President Erdogan he showed maps historical maps of Palestine which showed how the Zionist project had been stealing Palestinian land over the years now this summits final communique and obvi he turkeys not the one who writes it it's all of the oil seizure but the final communique was seen by many in the Arab and Muslim world is very weak do you see how such a weak statement or the statements that are made by Muslim majority countries and Arab countries it is the weakness of these statements and their stance this is what gives the green light for the colonialist expansionist project that's taking place in Palestine first the statement was that weak okay I don't know according to whom it was weak two leaders or to the if you speak to the people on the streets I mean I didn't close first embassy with American as it is it is not weak secondly we follow up this joint statement communique and what happened in New York and the resolution that we tabled together with Yemen was adopted actually was the first follow-up and concrete outcome of this meeting and also joint statement but as I said at the beginning and only the resolution was adopted at UN General Assembly is not enough or cannot be a only a step therefore we should continue our efforts there is no problem with the with the joint statement or joint declaration but we need to implement them we need to also follow up them and I I hope and I wish actually other Muslim leaders also dare to show this kind of maps as elder indeed and I I wish they also stand as strong as reject I Bardo van and and Turkey and when I went to New York ambassadors of ambassadors of some Muslim countries actually were not there because of the threatening and the pressure they left New York I want to they support the resolution but their ambassadors couldn't stay in New York because of the threatenings and and the pressure coming from our country so one one of those countries that many people notice their absence particularly in the OIC summit that took place in Istanbul was Saudi Arabia it sends a low-level minister to represent them now what was so outrageous for many people in the in the Muslim world was that Venezuela which is not even a Muslim country was represented like I just want to make any comment about any specific country but the Ummah actually is watching what's happening and how the each country is behaving and also which leaders are brave enough to stand against this decision also to defend the status of the alkyds also to defend Palestinians but I don't want to make any comment about any specific country okay thank you let's move to the GCC unfortunately the region that Turkey finds itself in is fraught with many conflicts and crises now the Gulf as you know has been in a crisis for seven months now since the United Arab Emirates Bahrain Egypt and Saudi Arabia and post the land sea and air blockade on Qatar in June 2017 your country has played actually a very big role in the GCC crisis in that many people believe if it was not for Turkish troops in Qatar that maybe Saudi Arabia the UAE would have invaded Qatar and it is your strong support for Fatah that has prevented a military conflict what's your take on this well if Qatar had taken any decision against any GCC countries we will be against that as to and the decision the decision against Qatar was not fair we made it very clear at the beginning and many claims and also conditions one of the conditions was actually to close the Turkish base in Qatar there are also base of other European and Western countries why they are these brotherly countries are not asking Qatar to close those bases but on it Turkish base what I am trying to say that it was a very unfortunate unit situation it has been a very unfortunate situation we don't want to see such a division in GCC or in the Muslim world and the stability in GCC is so important for all of us and there were some claims and accusations and so far not even one single evidence has been shared they told us that they will send all the evidences we haven't received anything and each time I see anybody from Kuwait from co-leadership I mean I asked them whether they have received any evidence about these accusations they say no because Kuwait is the mediator country and therefore it was a very much political decision and unfortunately it didn't serve the interests of any countries in the region or in each side so I hope they will overcome this situation soon and we still believe that Saudi Arabia can lead actually this process and to overcome this situation well I mean as you've arranged in Kuwait has been leading mediation you in your country has also tried in the very beginning actually a couple of days before the siege was announced president other one sent envoys to Riyadh and Doha to try and resolve things as things were escalating I went by personally and yourself one of the interesting things though is that when you follow Saudi media Egyptian media United Arab Emirates media they've actually been attacking Turkey as well and I've been very insulting as well just a few days ago a very close friend of the crown prince inside of Han bin Salman who heads the Saudi Lobby in the US Salman Ansari tweeted a picture of a dead Sudanese person in Sudan from many years ago claiming this was a totally killed by Turkish troops inside Doha in a clear attempt to sow discuses outrageous a Muslim first and foremost must be honest person okay unfortunately this is not the case we see since I became foreign minister in many Muslim countries okay secondly they all expect to support them whatever the decision or action that they are taking and they put pressure to many countries particle the Muslim countries to take aside during this crisis and they put the pressure to Somalia for instance and they threaten Somalia and some ones are rejected this is the dignity of the Somalian people and why are you dividing why is trying to divide the Muslim more than the Ummah you have your own issue and when they when you don't say that whatever they they are doing is right and then they don't like and they attack you these are the baseless accusations and one more problem I think they don't like that other one is that much popular well let's finish on your relationship with the US for a moment there appeared to be warming between Turkey and the United States and the early days of the Trump administration but the reality now is that maybe the relationship couldn't have been worse the US has imposed travel restrictions on Turks and you have reciprocated with similar ones on Americans till now the u.s. harbors the man that you accuse of attempting a coup in Turkey is there any light at the end of this what seems very dark tunnel in US America's relations normally we don't have any problem with any allies neither with us nor with European allies but they have been learning one thing that if there is any problem with Turkey or if they have if they take any action against Turkey it will be reciprocated by Turkey and Turkey has changed and Turkey will never avoid any other country okay and this is the dignity of the Turkish nation and secondly yes we have been passing through not easy years in our relations with United States their support to YPG and the weapons they have been given which is a terrorist organization and posing a direct threat to Turkey secondly after the attempted coup we asked United States to exercise Fethullah Gulen who is the leader of the Fatah terrorist organization so far they haven't and particularly these two issues have filled and anti-american emotions and sentiments in Turkey and overall there is a lack of trust as I told my colleague Rex Tillerson when we met in Paris in Vancouver also when we spoke on the phone yesterday to negotiate or discuss an issue or to take any joint action first we need to rebuild this trust and the mutual trust this is the problem right now and you has us and this administration particle president Trump and Tillerson also have been tolling telling us that they there for normalizing relations and strengthening the ties yes we are also for that but we need to get rid of all these legitimate concerns of Turkey and Turkish and people this is the situation thank you for minister terribly thank you very much for talking to Al Jazeera thank you you
