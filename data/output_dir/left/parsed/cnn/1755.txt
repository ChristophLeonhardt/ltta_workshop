place let's play it right now it's very
graphic right now we need your truck we
just need to get people over to the
hospital okay can you can you pull over

first of all it's horrific the aftermath
of a horrifying event more than 50
people killed more than 200 injured but
what we also see here is an enormous
outpouring of heart and bravery in
people helping each other trying to get
them to safety
