THE AMOUNT OF CHARGES FOR ITS
EPIPEN.
WE HAVE ONE PRODUCER THAT NEEDS
AN EPIPEN ALL THE TIME BECAUSE
OF ALLERGIES.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT, YOU CAN
DIVE.
SO MYLAN HAS BEEN ABLE TO RAISE
THE PRICE TO $600.
IN 2007, THE EPIPEN WAS $57, SO
THEY HAVE RAISED THE PRICE QUITE
A BIT.
HILLARY CLINTON AND CONGRESS
WANT ANSWERS.
ALL OF THE BIG DRUGMAKERS ARE

DRAG.
JOE: LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT IS
GOING ON IN SOUTH AFRICA.
HERE ARE SOME 30 YEAR YIELDS.
YOU WANT SOME YIELD?
HERE ARE SOME.
THERE'S THE CONCERN ABOUT THE
FINANCE MINISTER, HE IS IN
DISPUTE WITH THE PRESIDENT, WHAT
KIND OF LEGAL ISSUES HE COULD
FACE.
YIELDS ARE SHOOTING UP.
MEANWHILE, YIELDS ARE HIGHER IN
THE WEST TODAY, BUT ON A SMALLER
SCALE.
A MODEST TAKE HIGHER, 1.56 ON
THE 10 YEAR.
SCARLET: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
TURKISH LIRA.
TURKEY LAUNCHED ITS BIGGEST
MILITARY OPERATION IN SYRIA TO
FIGHT BACK AGAINST ISIS.
THE CURRENCY DID PARENTS LOSSES
AFTER JOE BIDEN VOICED SUPPORT
FOR TURKEY DURING A VISIT.
NORTH KOREA LAUNCHED A BALLISTIC
MISSILE, SO A LOT OF
GEOPOLITICAL CONCERNS HERE.
THE WEAKNESS IN THE WON IS A
RELIEF TO THE GOVERNMENT.
OVER THE PAST THREE MONTHS, THE

THAT IS PAINFUL FOR THE NATION'S

JOE: OIL HAS BEEN SWINGING
BACK-AND-FORTH, BUT HAS NOT HAD
A GOOD DAY, DOWN 2.8%.
IT HAD RALLIED EARLIER IN THE

LET'S CHECK OUT GOLD, WHICH ALSO
GOT HIT PRETTY HARD.
EARLY IN THE MORNING GETTING
SLAMMED, DOWN BY 1.4%.
THE THEME OF THE DAY BETWEEN
TREASURIES, YIELDS RISING, GOAL
DOWN,'S DOCS FLIPPING,
EXPECTATIONS OF RATE CUTS ACROSS
THE BOARD.
SCARLET: I'M LOOKING AT
DOLLAR-YEN.
IT IS SEEN AS THE MOST SENSITIVE
PAIR.
THIS IS VOLATILITY FOR
DOLLAR-YEN.
VOLATILITY FOR ONE MONTH, YOUR
WHITE LINE, IS SPIKING PASS THE
THREE MONTH, THE BLUE LINE.
WHY IS THAT?
THE ONE-MONTH CAPTURES THE BOJ
MEETING, AND YOU CAN SEE THAT
SPIKE ON MONDAY, THE FIRST DAY
THE BOJ MEETING FELL IN LINE
WITH THE CALENDAR.
THE ONE WEEK, THE PURPLE LINE,
IS FAIRLY LOW, WHICH PROVES THAT
TRADERS ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT
THE BOJ MEETING THAN JANET
YELLEN IN JACKSON HOLE.
JOE: YOU CAN ISOLATE WHAT
TRADERS ARE LOOKING AT.
IT WILL BE FUN TO LOOK AT THESE
AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE ELECTION
.
I MENTIONED EARLIER OIL
SWINGING, AND I SAW THIS GREAT
CHART THAT I WANTED TO SHOW.
THESE ARE THE DIFFERENT BEAR AND
BULL MARKETS FOR OIL IN THE LAST
YEAR.
ONE YEAR AGO, A BULL MARKET, 25%
IN AUGUST, THEN THIS BIG RED
BAR, A 48% PLUNGE THROUGH
JANUARY, THEN AN 88% RALLY FROM
JANUARY TO THE PEAK IN JUNE, AND
A 20% BEAR MARKET FROM JUNE TO
EARLY AUGUST, AND NOW ANOTHER
BULL MARKET, 21% UP.
YOU DON'T SEE THAT MANY BULL AND
BEAR MARKETS WITHIN ONE YEAR,
BUT IT SPEAKS TO HOW DRAMATIC
THE SWINGS AND OIL HAVE BEEN.
MATT: WHAT I AM LOOKING AT IS
YEAR END FORECAST FOR THE S&P
500.
A VERY COOL CHART, THE CONSENSUS
FORECAST IS BELOW WHERE WE ARE,
SO WALL STREET STRATEGISTS
TYPICALLY ARE MORE BULLISH THAN
ANY TIME NEAR THE PRESENT, AND
WE ARE TRADING AT 2170 AND
CHANGE.
THE BOA MERRILL LYNCH FORECAST
IS AT 2000.
YOU CAN SEE HOW FAR BELOW
CONSENSUS THEY ARE.
EVEN MORE BEARISH IS HSBC, 1960.
THEY ARE OUTLIERS ON A LOT OF
DIFFERENT CALLS.
VERY COOL STUFF.

HP SPLIT INTO GOOD BANK, THE
GROWTH SIDE, SERVICES, SOFTWARE,

I LOOK AT HPQ AND I COMPARE IT

26 ANALYSTS THAT RATE IT, 15 SAY

SELLS.
JOE: FOR MORE ON TODAY'S MARKET
ACTION, I WANT TO BLING AND --
BRING IN MICHAEL REGAN.
WHAT JUMPS OUT AT YOU?
>> THIS TRADING RANGE WE HAVE
BEEN STUCK IN FOREVER IS HOLDING
FIRM, A LITTLE SELLOFF TODAY,
BUT WHILE WE HAVE BEEN STUCK IN
THIS FLAT NARROW TRADING RANGE,
THERE HAS REALLY BEEN A ROTATION
GOING ON OVER THE PAST MONTH
INTO MORE CYCLICAL INDUSTRIES,
TECHNOLOGY, FINANCIALS,
INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES LEADING,
AND NOT SO MUCH UTILITIES,
CONSUMER STAPLES, HIGH DIVIDEND
STOCKS, SO IT BEGS THE QUESTION.
IS THIS A ROTATION FROM ONE
LEADERSHIP TO ANOTHER?
THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE ALL
YEAR WITH STRONG CYCLICALS IN
THE LEAD.
MATT: SINCE 1958, S&P 500
DIVIDEND YIELD IS THE HIGHEST IT
HAS BEEN RELATIVE TO THE 10 YEAR
YIELD SINCE 1958, THAT WAS
BEFORE ANY OF US WERE BORN.
>> IS THE LOWEST THE TREASURY
YIELD HAS BEEN.
MATT: THAT'S TRUE.
>> THERE IS THE ANIMAL SPIRITS
OF CHARISMA ABOUT THE ECONOMY.
I HAVE BEEN A PESSIMIST.
I FELT THESE HIGH VALUATIONS
WOULD MAKE IT TOUGH FOR THE
MARKET TO KEEP RALLYING FROM
HERE.
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU
CAN LOOK AT AND SAY THE ECONOMY
IS IMPROVING.
ONE OF THE THINGS IS THE ATLANTA
FED GDP FORECAST.
SCARLET: IT SHOT UP RECENTLY.
>> YEAH, 3.6% NOW.
GROWTH IN THE SECOND QUARTER WAS
HAMSTRUNG A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE
OF INVENTORIES.
SO MAYBE THIS IS A BOUNCE BACK
FROM THAT.
IT IS SURPRISING TO SEE THAT
STRONG GROWTH FORECAST FROM THE
ATLANTA FED.
MATT: HOW ACCURATE IS THE
ATLANTA GDP FED AS A PREDICTOR
OF REAL GDP?
>> THE CONSENSUS WE TRACK IS
LESS THAN HALF OF THAT, SO WE
WILL HAVE TO SEE WHO IS RIGHT,
BUT THE LATEST REPORTS BEING
THAT STRONG, TO HAVE THAT
INDICATOR LOOK AT HEALTHY.
MATT: SINCE IT IS PART OF THE
FEDERAL RESERVE BANK SYSTEM, DO
THEY HAVE TO BE MORE OPTIMISTIC?
SCARLET: DO THEY HAVE TO ATTACH
MORE WEIGHT TO IT?
>> IT'S BASED MORE ON THE DATA
AS IT COMES IN RATHER THAN A
CENTRAL BANKER MAKING A
FORECAST.
IT HAS SHOWN A MORE PLASTIC VIEW
-- MORE PESSIMISTIC VIEW IN
OTHER TIMES IN THE CYCLE.
SCARLET: THIS IS MORE AN
INDICATOR OF THE OVERALL ECONOMY
BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT JOB
GROWTH THERE.
>> I AGREE.
THIS REPORT YESTERDAY IS
FASCINATING FOR SEVERAL REASONS.
HOME SALES JUMPED 12%,
HIGHEST SINCE 2007.
TO ME IT IS A REASON TO BE VERY
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE ECONOMY,
NOT JUST HOMEBUILDERS, BUT THE
OVERALL ECONOMY IN GENERAL.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HOME
OWNERSHIP RATE, IT'S LOWEST
SINCE 1965.
SCARLET: MILLENNIALS, GO BUY

IT IS ALL DEMOGRAPHIC.

FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYER AGE, 33

I KNOW SKIED SAYS THE SAN
FRANCISCO BAY AREA COMMUNITY HAS
THE WORST HOUSING POLICY IN THE
U.S. 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING AS.
YOU RECENTLY RESIGNED AND
DECIDED TO LEAVE PALO ALTO
BECAUSE OF YOUR $6,200 A MONTH
SHARED RENT.
WHY IS THE CITY UNWILLING TO
ADDRESS THE ISSUE?
>> OUR PROBLEM WITH HOUSING IS
THAT WE HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY
ADDED FAR MORE JOBS THAN HOUSING
FOR DECADES.
WE HAVE THE LARGEST IMBALANCE IN
THE NATION WITH THREE JOBS FOR
EVERY HOUSING UNIT IN PALO ALTO.
BECAUSE OF THE IMBALANCE AND
REGIONAL SHORTAGE IN THE AREA,
HOUSING PRICES SPIRALING OUT OF
CONTROL.
SCARLET: WHAT I FOUND
FASCINATING IS THE PALO ALTO
MAYOR'S COMMENTS.
WE ARE LOOKING TO INCREASE THEIR
RATE OF HOUSING GROWTH, BUT
DECREASE THE RATE OF JOB GROWTH.
THIS DOES NOT MEAN WE WANT NO
JOB GROWTH.
WE WANT ME TO JOB GROWTH AND
METERED HOUSING GROWTH.
JOE: IS THAT A REASONABLE POINT,
THAT EVEN IF YOU WERE TO ADD
MORE HOUSING IN PALO ALTO THAT
IT WOULD CREATE A HUGE'S STRESS
ON THAT TRANSPORTATION
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE PROBLEM
WOULD SHOW UP A DIFFERENT WAY?
>> YOU NEED TO DO BOTH, AT
HOUSING AND INVEST IN PUBLIC
TRANSPORTATION.
MATT: IT IS ODD TO HEAR A MAYOR
SUGGESTED THAT HE WANTS TO LIMIT
JOB GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY HE
RUNS.
I DON'T THINK I HAVE EVER HEARD
ANY OTHER POLITICIANS SAY THEY
WANT TO HOLD JOB GROWTH BACK.
ON THE OTHER HAND, I CAN
UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULD NOT WANT
TO PUT STRESS ON THE
INFRASTRUCTURE.
IS TRAFFIC VERY HEAVY?
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO GET
AROUND IF YOU ADDED MORE
HOUSING?
>> I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE, BUT
IT TAKES SMART PLANNING AND A
DESIRE TO MAKE THOSE PLANS.
LOOK AT WHO IS ON OUR CITY
COUNCIL.
THEY ARE EITHER INDEPENDENTLY
WEALTHY AND DON'T NEED TO WORK
OR RETIRED.
YOU HAVE A MAYOR WHO BOUGHT A
HOUSE FOR LESS THAN $500,000,
BUT NOW IT'S WORTH MORE THAN $4
MILLION.
THEY DON'T NEED JOBS ANYMORE.
THEY ARE RICH ENOUGH.
JOE: THIS IS THE POINT I WANTED
TO ASK YOU ABOUT.
FROM YOUR TIME ON THE PLANNING
COMMISSION, WHAT IS THEIR
MOTIVATION FOR THE LACK OF
HOUSING?
IS IT JUST PERSONAL AND TRYSTS,
THAT THEIR REAL ESTATE VALUES
HAVE SURGE?
OR IS THERE TALK ABOUT
PRESERVING THE STATE OF THE
COMMUNITY AND NOT CHANGING MUCH,
DOES THAT HOLD WATER?
WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ABOUT THEIR
REAL MOTIVATION HERE?
>> I THINK THE FIRST ONE IS AS
YOU HAVE OUT LINE, THE HOUSING
SHORTAGE PROPS UP PEOPLE'S
HOUSING PRICES.
YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT
HOUSES FOR $100,000 AND THEY'RE
NOW WORTH MORE THAN $3 MILLION
OR $4 MILLION.
THEY DID NOT EARN THAT MONEY.
THEY BOUGHT INTO THAT MARKET AND
ENACTED THE POLICIES TO KEEP
THOSE PRICES HIGH.
WHETHER OR NOT WE COULD DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT, DEFINITELY.
MOST OF PALO ALTO IS ONE STORY
OR TWO-STORY STRUCTURES.
WE HAVE PARKING LOTS, STRIP
MALLS.
THERE ARE PLACES TO GROW AND GO
NEAR EXISTING PUBLIC TRANSIT
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO GROW IN A
WAY THAT WOULD HAVE THE LEAST
HARMFUL IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITY,
BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE DOING IT
BECAUSE IT IS PROPPING UP
HOUSING PRICES, AND NUMBER TWO,
THEY WANT TO KEEP LIVING IN THE
SUBURB.
GO AHEAD.
MATT: IS IT OK FOR A COMMUNITY
TO COLLECTIVELY SAY WE DON'T
WANT TO GET ANY BIGGER, WE DON'T
WANT TO INCREASE OUR POPULATION,
WE DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A MORE
DENSE AREA?
>> I THINK IT IS FAIR FOR A
COMMUNITY THAT IS NOT A JOB
CENTER.
I DON'T THINK IT IS FAIR FOR A
COMMUNITY THAT HAS PURPOSELY
INVITED LOTS OF FORTUNE 500
COMPANIES TO ESTABLISH
HEADQUARTERS IN THEIR CITY AND
THEN TO SAY WE WILL TAKE THE TAX
REVENUE, BUT WOULD NOT DO
ANYTHING TO HOUSE YOUR WORKERS.
JOE: HERE IS SOME PUSHBACK.
SCARLET: A BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTOR
WRITES "MOST CITIES DON'T HAVE A
SHORTAGE OF HOUSING, JUST IN
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE
WANT TO LIVE.
POLICY THAT CAN CONSTRAIN
DEVELOPMENT AND THE MORE
DEVELOPED PARTS OF CITIES CAN
FACILITATE DEVELOPMENT IN LESS
DEVELOPED NEIGHBORHOODS."
JOE: IS IT POSSIBLE THAT PALO
ALTO'S REFUSAL TO BUILD MORE
HOUSING IS A DE FACTO SUBSIDY TO
HELP OTHER AREAS GROW THAT NEED
THAT KIND OF GROWTH AND
POPULATION INFLOW?
>> I WOULD NOT SEE IT AS A
SUBSIDY.
I WOULD SEE IT AS A COST.
WE ARE A TECH OF IN SILICON
VALLEY.
-- TECH HUB IN SILICON VALLEY.
IT MAKES SINCE TO LOCATE NEXT TO
A RESEARCH UNIVERSITY,
INVESTORS.
WHEN PEOPLE ARE PUSHED INTO
AREAS THAT ARE NOT HUBS IN THAT
WAY, IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE FOR
COMPANIES TO SET UP SHOP, GROW,
FIND INVESTORS, FIND EMPLOYEES,
SO WHEN YOU PUSH OUT PEOPLE AND
CONSEQUENCES PUSH COMPANIES AWAY
FROM THAT ECOSYSTEM THAT MAKES
THEM THRIVE, EVERY ONE OF THOSE
COMPANIES IS THAT MUCH HARDER TO
START.
THAT MEANS IT'S HARDER TO START
NEW COMPANIES AND HARDER TO ADD
MORE JOBS.
JOE: DO YOU HAVE ANY OPTIMISM
THAT ANYWHERE IN THE BAY AREA
THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO IMPROVE
OR IS YOUR VIEW THAT THIS FIGHT
WILL GO ON FOREVER WITHOUT ANY
MEANINGFUL CHANGE?
>> THE ONLY MEANINGFUL CHANGE WE
CAN HOPE FOR IS THAT THE STATE
AND FEDERAL LEVEL.
EVERY CITY WILL CONTINUE TO ADD
MORE JOBS BECAUSE IT TAXES --
INCREASES TAX REVENUE.

TAKING ITS TIME TO GET A

THE STORY DONALD TRUMP IS
REFERRING TO, THE ONE THAT
ALLEGES HALF OF HER MEETINGS

RELIES ON UTTERLY FLAWED DATA

SUBSET OF INFORMATION ABOUT HER
MEETINGS.
THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS GONE ON
TO SAY THAT SHE MET WITH CLOSE
TO 2000 FOLKS CONNECTED WITH
VARIOUS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, AND
THOSE NUMBERS WERE NOT COUNTED
AS PART OF THE REPORT.
OTHERS DEFENDING THE CLINTON
FOUNDATION SAYING THE FOUNDATION
HAS THOUSANDS OF DONORS AND ONLY
SEVERAL DOZEN OF THEM GOT
MEETINGS WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS
SECRETARY OF STATE.
THEY ARE PUSHING BACK, BUT A LOT
OF HER PROBLEMS WITH TRUSTING
CREDIBILITY ARE BAKED IN THE
CAKE, AND WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS
HOPING TO DO IS TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THAT AND LET VOTERS GET LOST
IN THE DETAILS.
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DETAILS,
BUT HERE'S ANOTHER REASON NOT TO
TRUST HER.
JOE: I WANTED TO  ASK
EXACTLY ABOUT THAT.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DETAILS, IS
THERE ANYTHING THAT SHE DID THAT
LOOKS LIKE PAY TO PLAY?
>> THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF
E-MAILS THAT THE STATE

WILL BE RELEASED BETWEEN NOW AND
NOVEMBER, BUT THE RECENT BATCH
SHOWS THE APPEARANCE OF ACCESS.
IF YOU ARE ACTIVE WITH THE

WERE TOP-LEVEL CLINTON AIDES
TALKING TO EACH OTHER SAYING
MAYBE THIS PERSON WOULD LIKE TO
MEET WITH HER.
BUT DID THAT ACCESS TRANSLATE
INTO FAVORS OVER IS THAT THE OLD
WASHINGTON STAND BY, TO HAVE AN
EAR TO GET THEIR FOOT IN THE
DOOR, NOT THAT EITHER ONE OF
THEM IS GREAT.
MATT: AT THIS POINT, IT IS AN
IMPORTANT POINT.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
ACCESS AND ACTUAL FAVORS, WHICH
WOULD BE THE ETHICAL PROBLEM.
THERE IS NOT AN ETHICAL PROBLEM

CLINTON IS THAT EVERY MINUTE SHE
AND HER CAMPAIGN DEFEND THIS ART
TRY DECIDE -- TRY 2-D SIDE
WHETHER TO DEFEND IT, THAT'S A
LOST OPPORTUNITY.
THE HEAT IS OFF OF HIM AS LONG
AS HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT THIS.
LET'S TALK ABOUT NIGEL FARAGE.
HE WILL BE VISITING A RALLY IN
MISSISSIPPI.
HE IS THE LEADER OF THE UK
INDEPENDENCE PARTY THAT PUSH FOR
BREXIT.
SHOULD WE EXPECT AN ENDORSEMENT?
>> EXPECTATION IS HE WILL STOP
SHORT OF AN ENDORSEMENT.
HE TOLD THE LOCAL STATION IN
MISSISSIPPI THAT YOU COULD NOT
PAY HIM TO VOTE FOR HILLARY
CLINTON, WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE
HE SHOULD PROBABLY NOT BE
CASTING VOTES.
BECAUSE HE HIMSELF IS THE ONE
MAKING THIS POINT TO THE LOCAL
STATIONS, NOT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
, SOME CONFUSION FROM THE TRUNK
CAMPAIGN WHETHER THIS WAS
HAPPENING AND THEY WOULD APPEAR
TOGETHER.
WE WILL SEE MORE IN THE HOURS TO
COME.
JOE: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
SCARLET: SHOPPERS IN HONG KONG
WERE WAITING FOR UP TO TWO HOURS
IN LINE FOR A PERSONALIZED JAR
OF NEW TELE-.
HOW DOES IS HELP SLUMPING SALES
IN THE CITY?

SCARLET: I AM SCARLET FU.
"WHAT'D YOU MISS?"
WAITING FOR TWO HOURS FOR
CUSTOMIZED JARS OF NUTELLA.
SALES HAVE DECLINED, SO POP-UP
STORES ARE TRYING TO BRING BACK
FOOT TRAFFIC, AND THE LURE OF A
BOTTLE OF NUTELLA IS ATTRACTING
CUSTOMERS.
YOU USED TO LIVE IN HONG KONG.
>> PANIC AND THAT FEELING OF
MISSING OUT SPREADS REALLY
QUICKLY IN THE HARBOR CITY OF
HONG KONG.
POP-UP STORES HAVE BECOME AN
INTERESTING WAY FOR RETAILERS IN
HONG KONG TO GENERATE THAT FEAR
OF MISSING OUT AND GENERATE
SALES TO MATCH.
NUTELLA IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF
THAT.
NIKE AND OTHER BRANDS HAVE
STARTED TO DO THIS BECAUSE SALES
HAVE SLUMPED 416 STRAIGHT
MONTHS.
WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH POP-UP
STORES, BUT THAT IS NOT A
CONCEPT IN HONG KONG OR PARTS OF
ASIA, SO THIS IS JUST BECOMING
SOMETHING NEW.
SCARLET: THAT'S BECAUSE ALL THE
MALLS ARE STOCKED WITH LUXURY
NAMEBRAND PRODUCTS.
>> FALLING MAINLAND TOURIST
NUMBERS HAVE MADE IT SO THAT
THOSE STORES HAVE CLOSED UP
BRANCHES, SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF
VACANCIES AT THESE MALLS.
>> THE MALLS HAVE DONE BETTER
THAN THE STREET, THE STORES ON
THE HONG KONG STREET, BUT THERE
IS SUFFERING ALL AROUND.
YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD.
CHINESE TOURISTS, AS SIGNIFICANT
DECLINE, DOWN 11% IN THE FIRST
HALF OF THE YEAR, SO THESE
MAINLANDERS WHO LIKE LUXURY
BRANDS AND BUY THEM HAVE BEEN
MISSING FROM THE ECONOMY.
JOE: I'VE JUST MADE THIS CHART
THAT SHOWS THE ISSUE, THE WHITE
LINE IS THE YUAN VERSUS THE HONG
KONG DOLLAR.
THERE HAS BEEN A BIG LUNCH --
BIG PLUNGE.
IF YOU HAVE A BIG TICKET SPLURGE
, IT MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE TO GO
TO EUROPE THAN HONG KONG IF YOU
ARE GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF
MONEY.
>> WE DID SEE AFTER BREXIT THAT
THE NUMBER OF CHINESE CLICKING
ONLINE SURGED BECAUSE THEY WERE
ALL THINKING I CAN GO TO EUROPE
NOW OR THE U.K. AND BUY GOODS
FOR 20% CHEAPER.
SCARLET: WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS
NEW TELE-STORY, I THOUGHT OF
COURSE IT IS IN HONG KONG.
-- THIS NUTELLA STORY, I THOUGHT
IT IS AND HANG KONG.
YOU LIVED IN HONG KONG.
REMEMBER WHEN BAKERIES WOULD
FACE A RUN ON COUPONS BECAUSE
THEY THOUGHT THE BAKERY WAS
GOING TO CLOSE?
>> MY FAVORITE STORY WAS
PORTUGUESE EGG CARDS -- CARTS.
I REMEMBER THAT PEOPLE WOULD
LINEUP AROUND BLOCKS TO GET
THEIR HANDS ON THESE PORTUGUESE
TARTS.
MATT: WE HEAR MORE ABOUT THESE
FANS TAKING OFF AND GAINING SO
MUCH STEAM, THEN JUST DROPPING
IN HONG KONG, CHINA.
>> CUPCAKE.
MATT: I'M NOT A FAN.
I LIKE THE WHOLE CAKE.
>> THANK YOU.
JOE: YOU CAN CATCH BETTY LIU ON
