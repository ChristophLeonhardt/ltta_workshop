00:01:02,954 --> 00:01:04,622
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IRAN ONCE TO

8
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:05,355
STAY IN THIS DEAL BECAUSE THEY

00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,124
KNOW WHEN IT WAS CUT.

10
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:08,726
THEY GAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

11
00:01:08,726 --> 00:01:12,830
CASH IN EUROS AND ALLOW THEM TO

12
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,564

TRYING TO PAY THEM OFF TO BE

00:02:30,374 --> 00:02:30,675
WORLD.

33
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:34,378
THE NEGOTIATING AGREEMENT WITH

00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:39,951
ALWAYS BEEN STOVEPIPES, THAT WAY

36
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:40,685
WHEN WE WORKED WITH THE SOVIET

37
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:41,419
UNION AND OTHER COUNTRIES, YOU

38
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:43,554

39
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:44,121
EFFECTS AND HOLD IRAN

AND THEY SAID IF YOU IMPOSE ANY

42
00:02:50,995 --> 00:02:52,129
SANCTIONS POST NUCLEAR DEAL WE

43
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:52,730
WILL WALK AWAY FROM IT.

44
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,765
POLICE AFRAID TO DO SO.

45
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:56,934
YOUR BEHAVIOR WITHIN THAT REGION

46
00:02:56,934 --> 00:02:59,904
DESTABILIZED THE ENTIRE MIDDLE

47
00:02:59,904 --> 00:03:01,472
EAST.

48
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:06,978

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,855
>> JOHN KERRY, I HAVE TO SAY,

52
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:18,990
THE STRONG MINORITY ON THIS

00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,024
ISSUE.

54
00:03:20,024 --> 00:03:20,624
PEOPLE LIKE JOHN KERRY,

00:03:20,624 --> 00:03:22,159
REPUBLICANS AND MOST WORLD

56
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,228
LEADERS THINK WE SHOULD STAY IN

57
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:26,464
THE DEAL.

58
00:03:26,464 --> 00:03:31,369
HOW DO YOU DEFEND BEING IN THE

59
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:33,270
MINORITY ON THIS ISSUE?

60
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,909
>> WHEN THE AGREEMENT ITSELF WAS

61
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:39,510

INHERITED ITS, WE CAN WORK TO

63
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:48,886

WITHIN IRAN.

66
00:03:56,527 --> 00:04:01,432
AND ANY CHANGES TO IT.

67
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:03,467
IF THE AGREEMENT IS BAD, THAT IS

68
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:12,276
NOT A STABILIZER FOR WORLD

69
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:12,576
PEACE.

70
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:18,015
YOU HAVE TO HAVE VERIFIABLE AND

71
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:20,451
CONCRETE STEPS.

72
00:04:20,451 --> 00:04:24,288
AND WHAT IS OFF-LIMITS FOR US TO
