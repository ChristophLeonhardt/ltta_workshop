in the spirit of bright goodwill we here at the Andrew Clavin show occasionally try to improve understanding between conservatives and left wingers so that conservatives don't get so angry all the time and grab some annoying leftist by the throat and strangle him into semi-consciousness then sees his limp body by the heels and hold them upside down and slam his head repeatedly into the sidewalk that's what we're trying to prevent from happening so I find it's sometimes a good idea to try to explain what left wingers mean to say when they speak in those annoying little squeaky girly-girl voices they have if they're men if they're women their voices are more like car alarms anyway here to ease the tension is the latest edition of the lefties dictionary the reference work that explains what the people who don't know what they're talking about are talking about let's begin with the phrase Supreme Court to most of us the Supreme Court of those judges who gather in a very fancy building where even the bathrooms are made of marble and every stall comes equipped with a roll of crinkly ground brown paper with We the People written on it but left wingers use the phrase completely differently than human beings when a leftist refers to the Supreme Court he's thinking of a magical gathering of five caring judges who magically create laws out of the carrying magical goodness of their hearts over the objection of four mean uncaring judges who only want to uphold the nasty Constitution that made black people three-fifths of a human being by stealing the other two-fifths of their body parts to assemble slaves the five magical judges are appointed on the basis of how much they care because caring gives them the magic caring power by which they create carrying magical laws that take all your rights away another word leftist use differently than people is investment for most of us an investment is when you take the money you earned and put it in a business you believe in so the business can thrive and your money increase for a leftist and investment is when they take the money you earned and make a speech about poor people and then give the money to their powerful friends so that the leftist get reelected this explains another word leftist use differently greedy let's say you go to work for 40 or more hours a week and are paid money for that work and then left this come with guns and take the money away from you to give they're friends so they can get reelected and you say hey wait stop you stinking thief that's my money now you're greedy because you're stopping them from making an investment so they can get reelected and appoint judges to the Supreme Court who care enough to take all your rights away I hope these explanations will ease tensions between our two sides by helping conservatives understand that deep down when you come to think of it your left-wing neighbor or co-worker a friend is really just like you you know except evil trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show the Andrew Clavin singers ladies and gentlemen they're here with us today and this is the last show before the Clavin this weekend but yeah and and also it would like one more week to the election this is it and then after that we're just gonna sit here and kind of stare into the camera like this you know because there'll be nothing left to say of it but you can get through the Clavin this weekend by Eric Metaxas did an hour long interview with me on his show and so if you search that on soundcloud or just search it on google Clavin metaxas it will come up and you can listen to that or you can actually just go out and get my book the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in question you can just read that and you know they have those marketing gimmicks that they have with books this one comes with a special aura of protection so when you read it this little ball of light surrounds you and protects you through the Clavin last weekend did you anybody buy that I don't know all right so we had a good time last night right we all went to the dentist pray not all of us but we went to this very very fancy party to celebrate Dennis Prager University's getting like a gazillion hits on the one hundred and fifty million hits on their videos and lest you think I go to these parties all the time let me tell you I got invited because I did I did Dave Rubin show I did an interview and Dave Rubin showing he was a really good guy and he said so you going to the Prager thing and I said no I didn't get invited by my friends who I work with every day why he said well I'll get you invited I thought good Dave is gonna do Reubens gonna get me invited so so then I start getting tweets from him he's sending me those you know direct message tweets and he's saying so did you get invited yet you get invited yet hey listen you know I'm very centered within myself I don't mind my good friends who I see and work with every day don't invite me to their fancy party it doesn't bother me that doesn't hurt me just go and stand outside with my nose pressed against the glass like please sir could you just send out some food they're just the wind is so bitter cold so finally they broke down and they they invite all right show up but you just show you how happy they were to have me there they seated me with Shapiro everybody from The Daily wires on one table like right in front of the diet the diet and you know Shapiro is like the never Trump ER and Prager supports Trump the Shapiro sitting out by like the rest room and like they let me next and so but it was it was a lovely lovely evening and it is it is a really major accomplishment Prager has done a wonderful thing and the only thing I would say is that they didn't neglect to thank Jonathan hey our own beloved producer and the god-king of The Daily wire Jeremy boring who have made these really have made given these videos their look and tend to them and put them out and they really do look you know original and creative and they're just a way of teaching people basic principles of American life and judeo-christian ethics and all this stuff and Prager got up and he gave this speech which I really liked because well you know Prager can be very what's the word I'm looking for he can he can really you can really bring the intellectual goods you know he can really deliver an intellectual speech that sets out his opinions here here here and here but you didn't do that he came out and made a kind of sentimental speech about what he'd been trying to do his whole life and how touch he was that everybody showed up and he made this one point that really reached me where he talked about the fact that conservatives are at a disadvantage because conservatives tend to be happier than left wingers and he only has to take a look at I mean you know that every survey shows this but you really only have to look at them to see that this it's true and he said happy people don't want to fight you know you don't wanna fight you like your wife you like your job you like what you're doing you like your life you like life itself you like America why would you go out and fight you know and you and and I really do believe that's true because like I have never looked for a fight and my only the only thing that keeps dropping me into the soup is that it's never occurred to me to not say what I was thinking you know I mean like I have I say this I know this sounds a little funny but I have really good manners I mean I was just raised with really good manners and so i'm never rude to anybody but it never occurs to me to not say what's right and what i'm seeing right in front of and that has become the problem now that is in fact this is the prettier preggers new video is about this very thing so play it play this is our friend Kim stressful who brought out this great book the intimidation game talking about what it's like to be in America under leftism this is a United States of America you are totally free to express their political views no one is going to tell you what you can say or how you can say it right but what have you thought you'd be audited by the IRS or have your business boycotted or even lose your job would you speak freely then this isn't a hypothetical question it's happening to Americans right now it's what I call the intimidation game the object of this very real game is to make political opponents pay a high price for expressing their opinions it was a standard technique in the Jim Crow South in the 1950s it was used by racist Southern Democrats to shutup black civil rights groups like the n-double-a-cp and now these tactics have been revived and improved upon by today's Democratic Party and their allies on the progressive left they want to shut up conservatives just like racists once wanted to shut up blacks and their liberal supporters they do it in three ways first they harass second they investigate and prosecute and third they blackmail and why do they and this is becoming is this is becoming so pervasive that it's not you know we think about it on the universities and I'll talk about that in a second but it's really everywhere and and why do they do it because the old joke is the conservatives that left this one conservatives to shut up and conservatives one left us to keep talking because they know they can't win the argument everything they touch turns to garbage and so if you point it out then you're racist and sexist and you're this and that and those are just other ways all those things just translate into shut up that's all they mean when somebody calls you're racist it doesn't mean you hate people of different races somebody calls you a sexist doesn't mean you're unfair to women it just means shut up a real shame you Scott Adams the guy who does those Dilbert cartoons very funny Dilbert cartoons he's been kind of like talking about this election from a point of view of persuasion and the way psychologically then I think it was yesterday he just went nuts he got attacked and listen listen to this this is on Scott Adams blog he says I've been trying to figure out what comment rate Bynes Clinton supporters together as far as I can tell the most unifying characteristic is a willingness to bully in all its forms if you have a Trump sign in your lawn they will steal it if you have a Trump bumper sticker they will deface your car if you speak of Trump at work you could get fired on social media almost every message I get from a Clinton supporter is a bullying type of message they insult they try to shame they leave label and obviously they threaten my livelihood we know from project Veritas that Clinton supporters try to incite violence at Trump rallies the media downplays it we also know Clinton's side hired paid trolls to bully online you don't hear much about that yesterday by no coincidence Huffington Post Salon and daily cost all published similar-sounding hit pieces on me presumably to lower my influence Joe Biden said he wanted to take Trump behind the bleachers and beat him up let's play the Joe Biden club I have not wanted to get into if you notice in the national press talking about Trump's behavior his personal behavior but what he said he did and does is a textbook definition of sexual assault and thinking you know think about this but it's more than that he said because I'm famous because I'm a star because I'm a billionaire I can do things other people can't what a disgusting assertion for anyone to make the press always asked me don't I wish I were debating him no I wish her in high school I could take it behind the gym that's first of all I don't want glamorize violence but Donald Trump would bounce but Joe Biden down the street like a basketball you know not be a fair fight and you know it's the essence of bullying what he said there is the essence of bullying is that might makes right I can beat you up therefore I'm right and it doesn't matter what you say I mean that is that is the essence of what they are doing so anyway scott adams goes on and on he's just furious and at the end he says I'm endorsing Trump and Trump is gonna win and he really he really goes after him and this whole thing you know it is emanating the place we see it most is in the colleges and I want you to watch this video the Chico State and out here in California put out this is the Chico State Athletic Department puts out this video telling you what you should and shouldn't say and if you can I know you're you're you may be listening you may not be watching pay pay close attention to the progression of the things that you can't say and watch how it goes because it is the left in a nutshell I don't say retarded it's insulting the people with disabilities and that's not cool it's an offensive word and a mental disability doesn't define who you are I don't say the n-word growing up my mom taught me about the history of the word and and the meaning behind it and how it's derogatory to people with my skin color it's one of those words that just cuts really deep into your skin and just makes you feel like less less of a human being I guess I don't say mana as a female athlete I don't appreciate terminology that is used to degrade women I don't use the word spazz my cousin has disabilities he cannot control he grew up right down the street from me and we were best friends all throughout high school he was picked on and I believe that that word is derogatory towards him I don't say the word rape because even the hardest of workouts don't compare to the trauma of sexual assault I don't say run like a girl I don't say they're like a girl doing things like a girl shouldn't be an insult because I'm a firm believer that gender does not define an athlete I'm gonna run swim and throw to the best of my abilities and being a girl has nothing to do with that I don't say Europe a part of a woman's body should never be used as a connotation for weakness I don't say what are you growing up being both black and white I've always had to struggle with fitting in on once the other I'd rather people judge me based on Who I am than my ethnicity okay we're gonna unpack that in a minute but first we have to say goodbye to our friends on
