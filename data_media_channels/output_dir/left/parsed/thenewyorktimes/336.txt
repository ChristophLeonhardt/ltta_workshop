State of the Union
addresses can be a type
of partisan Pilates for some.
For others, it can
be a direct ticket
to becoming an internet meme.
Behind many of these reactions
is a careful calculation,
and we break it down.
You won't find many Democrats jumping out
of their seats for President Trump.
Senator Joe Manchin of
West Virginia is the exception.
He’s sitting right in the front.
And that’s likely
not a coincidence.
Here he is again
applauding Trump’s jab
at those who kneel for
the national anthem.
And again after Trump
mentions rising wages.
It’s a re-election
year for Manchin
and he’s in a state that
overwhelmingly voted for Trump.
Now he’s apparently showing
support for a president
from the opposing party.
Let’s go to the other
side of the aisle.
“We repeal the core of
the disastrous Obamacare.
The individual mandate is now gone.
Thank heaven.”
Did you catch that?
Overwhelming excitement,
except for Senator Lisa
Murkowski of Alaska.
Last summer,
Murkowski played a
key role to squash
efforts to repeal
the Affordable Care Act.
“Working with the Senate,
we are appointing judges
who will interpret
the Constitution as written,
including a great new Supreme Court justice.”
President Trump
threw a compliment right
at Neil Gorsuch,
but he didn’t take the bait.
“... in the history of
our country.”
Did you notice who stood?
Senator Joe Manchin.
But justices must make careful
and largely coordinated
choices about what statements
are uncontroversial enough
to warrant applause.
“We can achieve
absolutely anything.”
“America is grieving
for you.”
“Kenton Stacy would have died if it were not
for Justin’s selfless love.”
Another group that attempts
to play it down the middle: the military officials.
Like the justices,
they must decide what
is partisan platitude
and what is not.
“And I will not stop until
our veterans are properly
taken care of, which has
been my promise to them
from the very beginning
of this great journey.”
“We must modernize and rebuild
our nuclear arsenal, hopefully
never having to use it.
But making it
so strong and so
powerful that it
will deter any
acts of aggression
by any other nation
or anyone else.”
Watch as they hesitate.
“That the coalition 
to defeat ISIS has liberated
very close to 100 percent of
the territory.”
To clap or not to clap? In a
deeply divided Congress,
applause or silence can
send a powerful message.
