35
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,460
regimen we're doing the same things to

36
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,600
your hair consistently um it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,299
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> that part of the challenge is</font>

38
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:12,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">not working for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me I'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be frank</font>

39
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,069
which all I just like doing too much

40
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,860
stuff to my head so yeah and I'm not one

41
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,019
of those people that can go you know two

42
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:24,840
weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> without washing their hair like I</font>

43
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,350
wash my hair at least once a week I

44
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,030
don't know I don't know that's neither

45
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,340
here nor there point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this story</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is I</font>

46
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,620
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to do protective styles I</font>

47
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,019
told y'all I would and then I didn't so

48
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:40,049
here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are this is the world we're</font>

49
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:42,450
living in now this is our reality police

50
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,859
says she does she's going to do

51
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:45,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">something and then she doesn't that is</font>

52
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,959
the reality we're in right now so yeah I

53
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,720
still have a little bit of it left I

54
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean I'm really using it it's almost</font>

55
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,290
gone you remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that first month was</font>

56
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,150
trial and error so i used a lot of it

57
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,040
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of that but now i'm</font>

58
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,180
consistently using it and here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go see</font>

59
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,609
how much I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have left there's the line</font>

60
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:07,769
right there this is the whole bottle

61
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:11,549
that's the line so um I think this will

62
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,130
definitely be almost gone by December

63
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fastest I've ever gone</font>

64
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,989
through a bottle of castor oil that's

65
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:22,260
for sure and now that I've learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

66
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,079
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> incorporate it into my routine I</font>

67
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,819
think I'll keep using it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

68
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,650
know like why not<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm</font>

69
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,600
back to doing wash and gos more or less

70
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,519
guys um now that I'm back to doing wash

71
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,799
and gos more or less um I do use the

72
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,220
castor oil to seal my wash and gos do

73
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,850
like a little oil rinse

74
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,590
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> putting it directly onto</font>

75
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,780
my hair because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is such a heavy oil i</font>

76
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,700
dilute it in grape seed oil which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

77
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,160
very light and movable oil so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

78
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,330
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the benefits of the castor oil</font>

79
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,490
but it's not so heavy on my hair<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

80
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,110
that's something that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a lot of</font>

81
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,050
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget you can do my casserole is</font>

82
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,810
very old castor oil<font color="#CCCCCC"> in general to even</font>

83
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,580
the refined clear castor oil is still

84
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">very thick um dilute it in a carrier oil</font>

85
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,050
that's lighter like grape seed oil or

86
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,130
apricot oil is another good one that

87
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,339
one's pretty light too so yeah um that

88
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,610
is what I'm doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys that is what my</font>

89
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">life is about it now that it's starting</font>

90
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,480
to get chilly I am only doing wash and

91
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,930
gos like every other day or every two or

92
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,570
three days<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get my hair wet again so</font>

93
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,650
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I'm defusing with a hair dryer</font>

94
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,740
so I don't go outside with just wet hair

95
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,860
