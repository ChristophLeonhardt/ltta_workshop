1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,795
(soft piano music)

2
00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:05,416
There's an old soul in these dogs,

3
00:00:05,416 --> 00:00:07,749
and they appreciate you

4
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:10,150
in a way that a puppy can't.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,067
(soft piano music)

6
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:19,218
Muttville is a senior dog rescue.

7
00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:23,456
We save senior dogs and find
them fabulous new homes.

8
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,138
We get dogs in all sorts of conditions,

9
00:00:26,138 --> 00:00:29,853
and because they're old
they even have more issues.

10
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:33,046
With the matching funds we
got from the Subaru grant,

11
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:36,111
we got to set up our
own veterinarian team,

12
00:00:36,111 --> 00:00:38,886
because we don't want
to see any dog suffer

13
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:41,743
once it steps through our doors.

14
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:46,034
- I'm not sure that Ava
rescued me or I rescued her.

15
00:00:46,034 --> 00:00:48,240
My oldest granddaughter is now 12,

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,667
and the younger one is nine.

17
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:52,873
I watched them initially twice a week

18
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:54,753
and I loved that.

19
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:58,550
As they were older and they
have their various activities

20
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,522
and friends, I don't babysit as much.

21
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:02,927
I miss them already.

22
00:01:02,927 --> 00:01:06,468
It's very important for me to
have somebody to take care of.

23
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:07,641
It's just my nature.

24
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:09,394
I need to have that.

25
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:13,155
So, one night I was looking
through all the senior dogs

26
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:15,094
that were available, and I saw Ava

27
00:01:15,094 --> 00:01:18,902
and I thought, oh my god, this is it.

28
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:22,734
When I had read her bio, it
said she had a heart murmur.

29
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:26,286
But when Sherry told me that
she required heart surgery,

30
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,666
I was pretty taken aback.

31
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:31,206
They just really weren't
sure that Ava would even

32
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:33,867
make it through the night.

33
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:36,561
- What Subaru did with CNN Heroes

34
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:39,751
really allowed us to change our game.

35
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:41,913
Because we had our own vet,

36
00:01:41,913 --> 00:01:46,080
we could see what was going
on and save that dog's life.

37
00:01:47,288 --> 00:01:51,676
- If I don't feel needed,
then I don't feel loved.

38
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:53,186
But, Ava needs me.

39
00:01:53,186 --> 00:01:54,219
I need her.

40
00:01:54,219 --> 00:00:00,000
So, therefore love exists.
