MIKE POMPEO THE CURRENT CIA
DIRECTOR HAS BEEN CHOSEN BY
DONALD TRUMP TO REPLACE REX
TILLERSON AS SECRETARY OF STATE.
NATURALLY THE SENATE NEEDS TO
HAVE HEARINGS TO QUESTION
POMPEO AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR
NOT HE IS FIT FOR THE POSITION.
TO GIVE YOU A QUICK RUNDOWN OF
WHO MIKE POMPEO IS AND WHAT HIS
BELIEFS ARE, IN THE PAST HE HAS
MADE STATEMENTS DENYING CLIMATE
CHANGE, OPPOSING SAME-SEX
MARRIAGE, ARGUING THAT MODERATE
MUSLIMS ARE COMPLICIT IN
TERRORIST ATTACKS.
HE IS ALSO DEMONSTRATED ON
VARIOUS OCCASIONS THAT HE HAS
A HAWKISH STANCE ON
FOREIGN POLICY.
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO
IRAN, NORTH KOREA, SYRIA.
THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT
SENATORS WANTED TO ASK HIM
ABOUT.
I COMPILED WHAT I CONSIDERED TO
BE THE MOST INTERESTING
EXCHANGES.
THE HEARINGS ARE ONGOING.
I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE MORE CONTENT
FOR YOU MOVING FORWARD BUT IT'S
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW
THERE ARE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES
THAT ARE VERY MUCH CONCERNED
WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT.
MORALE IS LOW WITHIN THE STATE
DEPARTMENT, THERE ARE POSITIONS
THAT NEED TO BE FILLED WITHIN
THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND RIGHT
NOW THERE IS AN EFFORT TO
REPLACE REX TILLERSON WITH
SOMEONE WHO WOULD BE COMPETENT.
YOU GET TO DECIDE FOR YOURSELF
WHETHER OR NOT YOU THINK THAT.
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE
COMMENTARY FROM SEN.
PAUL AS OPPOSED TO ANSWERS FROM
POMPEO.
I DO THINK THIS IS AN
INTERESTING EXCHANGE.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE
FIRST VIDEO.
>>DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE THE
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO BOMB
ASAD'S FORCES?
OR INSTALLATIONS?
>>THOSE DECISIONS ARE WAITING
EVERYPLACE WE CAN.
WE SHOULD WORK ALONGSIDE
CONGRESS TO GET THAT BUT YES,
I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT HAS A
DOMESTIC AUTHORITY TO DO THAT.
I DON'T THINK THAT HAS BEEN
DISPUTED BY REPUBLICANS OR
DEMOCRATS THROUGHOUT AN
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.
>>IT WAS DISPUTED BY OUR
FOUNDING FATHERS WHO BELIEVE
THEY GAVE THAT AUTHORITY
TO CONGRESS.
>>MICHAEL, I WANT YOU TO JUMP
IN AND FILL THE GAPS.
>>THERE IS NO GAP TO
FILL IN THERE.
RAND PAUL CALLED HIM OUT ON IT.
HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE FREEDOM
CAUCUS, THE MOST 
CONSERVATIVE
GROUP OF CONGRESSMEN.
HE WAS THE WALKING FRIENDS.
WHEN HE ADVOCATED AT A TIME WHEN
OBAMA WAS CONSIDERING DOING
CERTAIN THINGS WAS EXACTLY WHAT
RAND PAUL IS SAYING TO HIM NOW.
AS HE IS STANDING FOR SECRETARY
OF STATE IT IS A TOTAL REVERSAL.
I THINK A TINY BIT OF LEEWAY IS
GIVEN TO PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING
TO ADHERE THE ADMINISTRATION
OF THEIR PRESIDENT.
THIS IS SO FAR FROM THE PERSON
HE WAS AND LEGISLATED AS AND GOT
HIMSELF IN RHETORIC OVER HIS
ADMINISTRATION.
IT IS EMBARRASSING.
IT'S ALSO INCREDIBLE HOW HE
TRIED VERY HARD TO PRESENT
HIMSELF AS A LESS HAWKISH
INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE AGAIN IF YOU
LOOK AT HIS PAST STATEMENTS HE
DIDN'T WANT TO SHUT DOWN
GUANT¡NAMO BAY, IS VERY MUCH IN
FAVOR OF THE ENHANCED IRRIGATION
THAT WAS CONDUCTED UNDER BUSH,
BASICALLY TORTURE.
DURING THIS HEARING WHAT I
NOTICED WAS THAT HE WANTED TO
PRESENT HIMSELF AS SOMEONE WHO
WAS MORE IN FAVOR OF DIPLOMACY.
HISTORICALLY IT IS NOT THE CASE
WITH MIKE POMPEO.
>>THE TRUTH IS YOU PRESENT
YOURSELF IS WHAT YOU THINK THEY
WANT TO HEAR AND THAT IS WHAT
HE IS DOING TODAY.
>>WE HAVE CROSSED INTO A PERIOD
WHERE CONSERVATIVES, THERE IS
ALMOST NO PRINCIPLE AND THEIR
PARTISANSHIP WHILE ACCUSING
DEMOCRATS OF BEING PARTISAN ñ
THEY ARE OUT OF CONTROL.
THERE IS NO PRINCIPLE ON
WHICH THEY STAND.
THE FREEDOM CAUCUS THEORETICALLY
WANTED LIMITED GOVERNMENT.
AND THE THOUGHT WAS AT LEAST
THOSE GUYS ARE PRINCIPLED.
THIS WAS WHAT WORKED, THIS IS
WHAT WAS POPULAR.
HE IS A BETTER NOMINEE FOR
SECRETARY OF STATE THAN REX
TILLERSON BECAUSE HE WAS A ZERO
ON A 1 TO 10 SCALE BUT IT IS A
CONTINUED DISASTER.
>>DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU WOULD
BE BETTER THAN REX TILLERSON?
WHILE REX TILLERSON DIDN'T HAVE
THE SAME CONTACTS, CONNECTIONS,
EXPERIENCE, POMPEO IS DEFINITELY
MORE HAWKISH THAN TILLER'S IN.
>>I THINK REX TILLERSON IS THE
WORST CABINET APPOINTMENT IN
THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
I THINK HE HAS WRECKED THE
STATE DEPARTMENT.
IT IS COUNTERINTUITIVE IN ANY
WAY TO MAKE PROGRESS.
>>IT WAS LIKE APPOINTING A
SURGEON TO HOUSING AND URBAN
DEVELOPMENT.
>>TILLER SEND AGAIN, WE LIKED
THEM A LITTLE BECAUSE HE
RECOGNIZED TRUMPS MORONITY.
THIS
IS STILL A GUY WHO RAN A GIANT
OIL COMPANY.
THEY HAD THEIR OWN FOREIGN
SERVICE, AND OWN MILITARY AT
EXXON.
TO 
THEM 
TO 
STATE DEPARTMENT
DIPLOMACY WAS TIGHTENING OF
THEIR BELTS, IT INFRINGED ON
THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE A PROFIT.
AS BAD AS BEN CARSON IS, THE
DAMAGE THEY COULD DO IS SO
LIMITED IN COMPARISON TO THE
STATE DEPARTMENT, I AM NOT
DELIGHTED THAT MIKE POMPEO IS
THERE, HE IS A HORRIBLE CHOICE.
TO LISTEN WAS WORSE.
>>TO THIS POINT A REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSMAN IN DC SAID TO ME
THAT MIKE POMPEO IS UNQUALIFIED
BUT AMBITIOUS AND WITHIN THESE
SPHERES ADMISSION IS WINNING.
>>AMBITION IS SCARY WHEN IT
COMES TO SOMEONE LIKE POMPEO.
MY WORRY IS THAT HE IS MORE
ALIGNED WITH TRUMP WHEN IT
COMES TO THE WORST IDEAS THAT
TRUMP HAS IN FOREIGN POLICY.
>>I DON'T DISAGREE.
>>I KNOW TILLOTSON WASN'T A
MITIGATING FACTOR.
TRUMPED AND REALLY RESPECT HIM.
HE WAS JUST AS MARGINALIZED AS
KELLY.
>>BUT HE DID MEDICATE ON THE
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.
IT WAS TILLER SINCE VOICE IN THE
ROOM THAT CAUSED THE PRESIDENT
NOT TO GO ALL THE WAY.
>>THIS IS 
A CRAZY CONVERSATION
THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE IN AMERICA.
WHO DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE
SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON
OR MIKE POMPEO?
IT IS A JOKE CONVERSATION.
THEY ARE BOTH TERRIBLE IN THEIR
OWN INTERESTING WAYS.
ONE OF THE WAYS THAT POMPEO IS
DANGEROUS IS THAT HE COULD
APPEAL TO TRUMPS MOST
INTERVENTIONIST DARKEST, MOST
MILITANTLY BELLIGERENT SIDE.
>>ACTUALLY WANT TO SKIP AHEAD
TO THE VIDEO WHERE POMPEO AND
RAND PAUL ARE TALKING ABOUT THE
IRAQ WAR AND WHETHER OR NOT
IT WAS A MISTAKE.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
>>DO THINK THE IRAQ WAR
WAS A MISTAKE?
>>I WAS RUNNING A MACHINE SHOP
IN KANSAS AT THE TIME.
>>HOW ABOUT OPINIONS NOW?
>>
I MAY WELL HAVE HAD AN OPINION.
BUT MY OPINION NOW AS WE CLEARLY
HAD BAD INTELLIGENCE.
>>BUT IT'S NOT JUST BAD
INTELLIGENCE, WE DID
GEOPOLITICALLY THE WRONG THING.
WE GOT RID OF THE ENEMY OF IRAN,
BE EMBOLDENED IRAN, WE BROUGHT
CHAOS TO THE MIDDLE EAST.
YOUR PRESIDENT SAID THE IRAQ WAR
WAS THE SINGLE WORST DECISION
EVER MADE.
I AM CONCERNED THAT YOU WON'T BE
SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT, THAT
YOU WILL BE INFLUENCING HIM IN A
WAY THAT I THINK HIS
INCLINATIONS ARE BETTER THAN
MANY OF HIS ADVISERS.
THAT THE IRAQ WAR WAS A MISTAKE,
THAT WE NEED TO COME HOME FROM
AFGHANISTAN.
HE WAS AGAINST BEING INVOLVED IN
SYRIA AT MANY TIMES IN HIS
CAREER SO I THINK HE DOES HAVE
GOOD INSTINCTS.
WILL YOU BE LISTENING TO WHAT
THE PRESIDENT WANTS INSTEAD OF
BEING SOMEONE WHO ADVOCATES FOR
US STAYING FOREVER IN
AFGHANISTAN, ANOTHER IRAQ WAR,
BOMBING SYRIA WITHOUT
PERMISSION.
THESE ARE THE ADVICE YOU
WILL GIVE.
>>ANYTIME THEY ARE ASKED ABOUT
SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE THEM
LOOK BAD IF THEY ANSWERED
TRUTHFULLY THEY DON'T RECALL.
>>THESE ARE UNBELIEVABLE TIMES
AND I AM REMINDED OF SPRINGSTEEN
RADIO.
THERE ARE 
TWO THINGS HERE THAT
WOULD MAKE EVERY REPUBLICAN NOT
VOTE FOR THEM IF ñ THE COMMITTEE
WOULD SAY WE CAN'T SUPPORT THIS
GUY, ONE HE SAYS I WAS RUNNING A
MACHINE SHOP IN KANSAS AT THE
TIME.
YOU CAN'T HAVE THE JOB THEN.
I WANT SOMEBODY ELSE WITH
AN OPINION.
AND HE SAYS INTERESTING BECAUSE
THE CONSENSUS IS WE MADE A
MISTAKE.
SOME ANSWER THAT SUGGESTS YOU
THOUGHT ABOUT IT, NOT I WAS
RUNNING A MACHINE SHOP I'M NOT
GOING TO ANSWER.
AND THEN RAND PAUL WAS GOING TO
BE CHAMPIONED ON THE LEFT AND
RIGHT FOR STANDING UP AND
RECOGNIZING THE MISTAKE WE MADE.
IN THE MIDDLE THAT UNDERMINES
THE CREDIBILITY AND SAYS I THINK
TRUMP HAS GOOD INSTINCTS.
NO, HE HAS INCOMPETENT
INSTINCTS.
DIFFERENT PAUL WAS TRUE, HE
WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT THORN
IN DONALD TRUMP SIDE INSTEAD
OF THE FAKE THORN.
MY HUNCH IS THAT HE GAVE HIS
ANSWER TO RAND PAUL.
IT IS SO NONSENSICAL AND WE HAVE
SEEN TWO REASONS WHY THIS GUY
SHOULD NEVER BE SECRETARY
OF STATE.
>>A LOT OF THE STUFF IS
POLITICAL THEATER, AND ATTEMPT
TO MAKE SURE THEIR CONSTITUENTS
SEE THAT THEY ARE SPEAKING
STRONGLY ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY
SUPPORT.
AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE SENATE
HEARINGS WITH MARK ZUCKERBERG.
>>THAT IS THE BEST EXAMPLE.
>>IT WASN'T EVEN ABOUT
PROTECTING DATA OR PRIVACY.
IT WAS ABOUT I AM A CONSERVATIVE
LAWMAKER AND I AM VERY
OUTRAGED THAT YOU ARE CENSORING
CONSERVATIVES.
>>WHEN THERE IS A SEXY WITNESS
EVERYONE IN CONGRESS ñ
>>THEY WERE INTERVIEWING
ZUCKERBERG FOR A JOB.
RAND PAUL ASKED QUESTIONS THAT
TAUGHT US SOMETHING.
BUT IT WON'T MATTER.
THAT IS 
WHAT GETS ME.
