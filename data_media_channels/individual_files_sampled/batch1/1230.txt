mr. Bonilla is certainly putting the miles in he's been all over Ireland and here he wants to meet more of his misdeeds accepts in a city that saw so much violence he had a chance to stress the importance of breakfast not damaging the peace we are open to any solution we'd be able to maintain fast agreement in all its dimensions the city still has two names Londonderry for the Protestant unionists over the river Derry for Catholic Irish nationalists who never took down their signs of protest against what they saw as British occupation the IRA fought on these streets until recently it felt like a long time ago anybody under the age of 30 can have no real idea about just how bad things used to be here but clearly the fact that they built a peace bridge to join up the once divided communities tells you everything you need to know they had of course assumed that the troubles were a thing of the past that they could never happen again but then again they haven't thought about brexit the border with the Republic of Ireland is just a 5-minute drive out of the city and as of now you switch countries without any sign when Dermot's was growing up the road was blocked when the British forces were everywhere for Republicans it was a constant reminder of a divided Ireland just like a hard border would be after brexit a reinforces partition on the island well that's that's really what it what breaks it is about the physical manifestation of division and of course plays in the face of everything about that the Good Friday Agreement stood for you're dealing with a British government that you know that would respect the agreements that they make Intl agreement said to me the only way to go is to get a little get away from them and the only way we can do that here that's for a near term it's friendly in the right he drives a taxi now but he used to be an IRA who was in prison for 15 years so do you reckon there are dissident republicans who might regard the re-emergence of a hard border as an opportunity why thanks oh yes yeah because I think they're financed it's a shooter yeah yeah yeah because at the moment I think look I don't have any time for them to be honest with thee I think they're finding it very hard he actually shared up what they would call operations but after setting the border they don't have to operate from the north they could sit in the field and just fire and that's the problem and I think I don't like are capable of adenoid but they will be capable of it and they would be surely tempted idiot commentators often say that brexit could destabilize the peace agreements in Ireland but don't explain how in reality it means that every single country lane on the border would be heavily policed and would cause enormous disruption to border communities which already have historical suspicions of Britain brexit is in England talk all the time about taking back control for people here it would be economically and socially disastrous and it is not an exaggeration to say it could lead to violence Lawrence Lee al-jazeera Northern Ireland
