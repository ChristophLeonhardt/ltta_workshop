1
00:00:00,868 --> 00:00:03,137
BUT FIRST, KRISTIN FISHER HAS

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,942
WALTER REED MEDICAL CENTER.

3
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:09,343
>> IT'S RAINING SO HARD RIGHT

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,678
NOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP ARRIVED

5
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,680
BY MARINE ONE BUT HE HAD TO

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,515
LEAVE BY MOTORCADE BECAUSE IT

7
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,716
SIMPLY WASN'T SAFE TO FLY.

8
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,518
AS FOR THE FIRST LADY, WE ARE

9
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,485
TOLD THAT SHE IS RECOVERING.

10
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,222
WE ARE TOLD THAT SHE'S IN VERY

11
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:23,490
GOOD SPIRITS AND SHE IS EXPECTED

12
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,792
TO BE IN THE HOSPITAL FOR ABOUT

13
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:25,693
A WEEK.

14
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,528
WHILE THIS WAS A FAIRLY ROUTINE

15
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:28,495
PROCEDURE, ANY TIME YOU ARE IN

16
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,397
THE HOSPITAL FOR ABOUT A WEEK

17
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,665
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY PRETTY SERIOUS.

18
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,668
WE ALL FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS AND

19
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:35,536
WERE SURPRISED BY THE STATEMENT

20
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,570
THAT CAME FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

21
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,671
JUST A FEW HOURS AGO.

22
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:38,639
IT WANT TO READ IT TO YOU IN

23
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,308
FULL.

24
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:42,943
"THIS MORNING FIRST LADY

25
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:43,577
MELANIA TRUMP UNDERWENT A

26
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,480
PROCEDURE TO TREAT A BENIGN

27
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,281
KIDNEY CONDITION.

28
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,883
THE PROCEDURE WAS SUCCESSFUL AND

29
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:50,517
THERE WERE NO COMPLICATIONS.

30
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,653
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT

31
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,322
CONDITION IS, BUT EMBOLIZATION

32
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:56,156
IS TYPICALLY USED TO TREAT A

33
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,124
TUMOR AND IN THIS CASE WE

34
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,893
BELIEVE IT'S A BENIGN TUMOR

35
00:00:58,893 --> 00:00:59,627
BASED UPON THE STATEMENT THAT I

36
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:01,095
JUST READ YOU.

37
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,796
BUT THE WAY IT WORKS, I STILL

38
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,498
GOT A FEW DOCTORS THIS AFTERNOON

39
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:05,599
AND ESSAY THE WAY IT WORKS IS

40
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,534
YOU PUT A CATHETER IN AN ARTERY

41
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:08,302
AND YOU INJECT SOME PARTICLES UP

42
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,503
INTO THE BLOOD VESSELS THAT

43
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:12,673
SURROUND THAT TUMOR, ESSENTIALLY

44
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:13,374
CUTTING OFF THE BLOOD SUPPLY.

45
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,075
THE WAY IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME,

46
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,644
IF THERE IS NO BLOOD SUPPLY THAN

47
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,879
THE TUMOR DIES.

48
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,481
THAT'S THE PROCEDURE SHE HAD

49
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:20,915
TODAY.

50
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,716
AS FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE

51
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,184
ARRIVED HERE A LITTLE OVER AN

52
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,452
HOUR AGO BY MARINE ONE TO VISIT

53
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:25,819
HIS WIFE.

54
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,155
WE ARE TOLD THAT HE DIDN'T COME

55
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,723
OUT HERE SOONER, HE DIDN'T COME

56
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:31,091
UNDER THIS MORNING WHEN SHE

57
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,226
ACTUALLY HAD THIS PROCEDURE

58
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:32,960
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO TIP

59
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,663
OFF THE PRESS.

60
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:38,098
THE PRESS WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW

61
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,133
HIM ANYWHERE THE PRESIDENT GOES.

62
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,768
THAT'S WHY HE WASN'T A PURE THE

63
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:41,502
VERY BEGINNING.

64
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:42,336
THAT'S WHY HE CAME LATER.

65
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:43,671
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THIS

66
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,306
WHITE HOUSE WANTED TO KEEP THIS

67
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:45,673
A SECRET.

68
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:48,542
THE FIRST LADY OF COURSE IS

69
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,311
KNOWN TO BE A VERY PRIVATE FIRST

70
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:51,378
LADY, THOUGH IN RECENT WEEKS SHE

71
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,880
HAS REALLY HAD A BIT OF A COMING

72
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,147
OUT.

73
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:56,050
JUST LAST WEEK WE SAW HER UNVEIL

74
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,918
HER OFFICIAL PLATFORM.

75
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,421
SHE HOSTED OUR FIRST STATE

76
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:00,754
DINNER.

77
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:01,655
NOW THIS AND NOW OF COURSE

78
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,490
EVERYONE IS JUST HOPING AND

79
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,825
PRAYING THAT SHE MAKES A FULL

80
00:02:04,825 --> 00:00:00,000
RECOVERY AND IT'S NOTHING MORE
