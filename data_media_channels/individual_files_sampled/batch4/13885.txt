oh man this is a tough day for me it was tough waking up this morning and finding the reason to go on the Ravens the Ravens lost yesterday they law my Baltimore Ravens lost on a missed extra point on a missed extra point in the final seconds of the game they got the most accurate field goal kicker in the history of the league he's never missed an extra point in his entire career including College like 300 straight made extra point kicks and this is the one that he decides to miss and then we lost the game and to make matters worse you know after the game last night I was sitting in the living room in a state of deep shock and and misery and in a bit of a existential crisis asking myself what's the point of life what's the point of anything and then my my daughter comes in and she she says what what's the matter daddy are you sad you look sad and I said I said yes I'm very sad the Ravens lost on a missed extra point at the end of the game and she said what's an extra point and I said well it's the field goal that you kick after a touchdown if you're not gonna go for two and she said what's a field goal what's a touchdown what's going for two and I said please stop interrogating me can't you see that I'm that I'm traumatized here and she said well are you gonna cry daddy and I said yes I might cry I might cry and she said well daddy's don't cry no daddies don't cry and I said you're right daddies don't cry except when their football team loses on a missed extra point at the very end of the game then they might cry and then she said and I'm not gonna quote her exactly okay she said that's silly daddy that's silly to cry over football football is silly and so what was I gonna do I called the police on her had her car get away which is not the kind of thing that you want to ever it's not a decision you ever want to make as a parent especially when your daughter is five years old but what else was I going to do she's she's a she's gonna go around saying things like that she's a threat to society all right but I will in a in a in an act of great courage and resilience I will try to soldier on and move on somehow with my life all right what I want to talk about the the film about Kermit Gosnell has entered its its second week at the box office it entered its second week this past weekend and despite only showing on 600 or so theaters in its first week and despite the limited budget and despite being ignored by the media it completely it managed to crack the top ten in its first week top ten at the box office which is extremely impressive okay to get into the top ten given the situation now keep this in mind when it comes to box office totals and you hear about you know you hear about a movie like like Avengers is number one at the box office for ten straight weeks or whatever well keep in mind that movies like The Avengers they open on four thousand screens and they have hundreds of millions of dollars of marketing and merchandise I mean you can't avoid them but you know for six months leading up to the movie coming out the movies everywhere everywhere you go you see it you see previews of commercials and merchandise and then it's on every single screen across the universe and so a movie like that it has to be number one umber one for two months if it's not that it's a massive failure because the movies the movie studios pay a lot of money to manufacture interest and to get the movies out there and so that's why in my mind there's nothing particularly impressive about a massively hyped massively expensive movie showing on four thousand screens with fifteen showings apiece ending up number one at the box office but that's why I'm never you know every time there's a new Marvel movie or Star Wars and everyone's like oh it's the number one movie in history again we of course number one that you know movie tickets now cost eighty seven dollars as opposed to as opposed to in the 90s and there were five dollars and the movie studios paying millions of dollars to brainwash us into see in the the freaking thing so of course of course it's number one that's not a president but a movie like like Gosnell with no press very little marketing on a few screens in a small budget well cracking $1,000,000 and the top ten in that case is huge yet as the daily wire reported this weekend the film was dropped again only at second week it was dropped from almost 200 screens of the of the only 600 it was showing on in its second week this is a top 10 movie that was dropped in its second week and dropped from theaters with 20 or 30 screens where it was in the top 10 among all those films and many of those theaters dropped it after one week which is unprecedented which is it's just it's unheard of despite what anyone might want to say to try to you know come up with a rationale this is unheard of this doesn't this doesn't have even if a movie performs really poorly in its first week it's pretty rare for it to be dropped after one week usually at least gets one other week but to be a top 10 movie and then get dropped after after seven days in the theater it's just it's ridiculous let me read a little bit of story from The Daily wire it says according to John Sullivan the film's marketing director who also served as a producer the drop cannot be written off as a mere coincidence or quote business as usual he says he told the daily water I can tell you from my experience in 15 years of releasing movies independently we're in uncharted territories it is an impacted fall no doubt about it but the fact that we've been dropped from theatres where the movie is the number six or number nine movie is just something you don't see it's hard not to believe it isn't about the content of the movie we have theaters that are dropping on the movie that are that are top theaters that are performing very well we've been the number six in a 15 plex theater and it gets dropped this week we've been number nine in a 30 Plex and we're getting dropped this week so that's it's the number nine movie out of 30 and they drop it there are about 15 15 theaters like that where typically you would not get dropped he says I do recognize it's a crowded market marketplace because Halloween is is you know going to be a huge opening but it's very odd to me that you're within the top ten and you're getting dropped out of a movie house the filmmakers have also received varying reports of theaters actively preventing customers from buying a ticket by not advertising the film were declaring it sold out before capacity is reached while some of those situations may be the result of human error Sullivan says the apparent blackballing is too consistent to be ignored and then he goes on to talk about how it's unprecedented in a public statement of Facebook the film's producer said he had received worrying reports from across the country regret regarding customers inability to buy tickets and then he talks about some stories of people that you know even in the theaters where it's being shown they're being prevented or it's being made difficult to buy tickets to the movie now one of the ways that you know this isn't all a coincidence is because this is how this is just totally in keeping with how the Gosnell story has been treated and how the Gosnell movie has been treated and and the actual event itself before them but I'm speaking of the you know staying in the movie for just a minute we should also mention that hardly any media outlets even bothered to review the movie Rotten Tomatoes which is a site that compiles movie reviews so you could go and see you know get a get kind of an aggregated percentage score on how a good movie is even though the percentages are oftentimes very misleading but it could only find 10 reviews for Gosnell across the entire internet it could find you could find 10 reviews by comparison the Halloween movie which came out this weekend has over 200 reviews so that's 200 reviews 210 now obviously Gosnell isn't as big as a movie as Halloween despite being scarier and having a more evil villain but and a more prolific killer also at the core of the movie but still that disparity is ridiculous only 10 reviews whereas you know a movie will typically get 100 150 200 or more that is not a coincidence as the marketing director of the film pointed out this is not a coincidence there is an active decision being made to ignore this movie to blackball this movie to censor this movie now can it be justified on any kind of practical level no as I said the movie has been a success in spite of all this obviously showing that there's intense interest in the movie the average movie if it's only playing on 600 theaters and it's not getting any press and there's hardly any marketing the average movie like that is just it's not it's going to make a few it's gonna make a few thousand dollars and then it's gonna be gone but as I said to pull in a million get into the top 10 that shows that there is enormous interest in the movie so you can't justify it on that you can't say well of course it's being ignored it's just a you know it's a movie nobody cares about people do care about it and then the story you can't say well the story doesn't matter I mean you know it's it's I mean it's it's it's a it's an irrelevant story that's what no the story is very dramatic very relevant very current Gosnell is as the tagline of the movie correctly points out Gosnell is the worst serial killer in american history now to recap very briefly in case you've forgotten about Gosnell or if you've never heard about him in the first place the abortionist was was officially charged in 2013 with the murders of seven infants and one woman but the total body count is is much higher than that Gosnell used scissors to sever the spinal cords of hundreds of live babies hundreds maybe even more maybe thousands one employee of the of the clinic in Philadelphia testified that she personally witnessed this procedure snipping as Gosnell called it at least thirty times so although he was although he was only charged only charged with murdering seven infants as if that's not bad enough you've got just one witness who says well I saw it happened 30 times in some cases she was given the child's severed feet or any or another severed body part to put in a jar and keep as a trophy to be clear children were I just think this needs to be emphasized children were born alive out side the womb fully formed these are born infants and then they were decapitated that's what was going on hundreds and hundreds of times over the course of 30 years there's a reason why this clinic was dubbed the house of horrors because it's not a cliche it really it really was there were quoting from from a-1 medical student who saw it he said there were fetuses and blood all over the place you could another nurse reports that you could literally hear the screams of children who were born alive and then butchered so if you can imagine this this this butcher shop where there's blood stains on the walls body parts in jars and buckets and and the screams of children being murdered I mean it's just carcasses and body parts were stored in shoeboxes water jugs break room refrigerators and this is to say nothing of the of the unsanitary medical equipment which caused disease and infection and the patient patients one woman had to go to a hospital and and have part of her intestine removed after contracting an infection from from Gosnell's clinic and then another woman died at least one woman died as a result of this of this malpractice now the point is this is a significant story that deserves to be told that should be told it's the kind of story that if it were happening in any other profession any other alleged medical field there would have been five movies and two TV specials about it already I mean if you can imagine if you could imagine an orthodontist or or a pediatrician murdering hundreds of patients it would be the biggest story in the country and film adaptations would come almost immediately that's the way it would be treated but this because it's an abortionist has always been treated as a non-story one Washington Post reporter infamously said that gozman Gosnell systematic slaughter of infant's over the course of 30 years is just a local crime story that's how she went when when asked to justify her papers decision to ignore the story she said well sir just a local crime story hundreds of dead babies local crime story so and to put that in context by the way this is not long before Ferguson where you had one you know one one teenager that was shot by a police officer and what turned out to be a totally justified shooting but that you know what one person being killed that that wasn't treated as a local crime story nobody said that was local crime the Washington Post was all over that yet hundreds of babies being killed in a major American city in a in an alleged medical facility over the course of 30 years that's just local crime so why is this happening why did the media ignore why does it still ignore the Gosnell case why does the left in general treat this like it never happened why are they so terrified of Gosnell that's the question and I think there are three pretty obvious reasons that we'll get into it now so why is this being ignored number one I think the Gosnell case really explodes one of the most common pro-abortion talking points which is namely that the prohibition of abortion will lead if you prohibit abortion that's going to lead to horrific and unsanitary back-alley abortions and so forth now that's what we're told you know we're told well you can't get rid of abortion because then it's gonna be this it's gonna be a horror show or there's women you know getting abortions and these unsanitary conditions unsafe conditions as as if it's possible to safely as if as if it's ever possible to have a safe abortion which of course it isn't by definition because by definition in every abortion in every successful abortion that's ever been performed at least one human being has been killed so there's no such thing as a safe abortion but those kinds of abortions that the pro board people worry about those kinds of abortions happened at Gosnell's clinic for 30 years even though abortion is legal and I think a person who takes note of that fact who says well hold on this is exactly the kind of abortion that I thought we were preventing by having abortion legal and so I think if you notice that and then if you get really curious and you start investigating you say well I mean is Gosnell really unique or have there been situations like this in other clinics across the country and if you investigate that you're going to discover no Gosnell is not unique in fact now he might be on the more on the more severe end of the spectrum but in terms of unsanitary unclean just horrific ly disgusting environments at abortion clinics you you find that across the country that is not unusual as well as by the way babies being killed after after being born alive that is also not unusual so a person who takes note of that fact may begin to understand that abortion is a fundamentally dirty unsafe violent gruesome thing and you can't change that fact by making it legal so that's one reason why the case is ignored number two on a political level it is impossible to report on this story without implicating the Democrat Party Philadelphia is a city run by Democrats and it was in that Democrat run City that a serial killer was able to operate his Enterprise for 30 years without interference I mean all you needed to do was walk inside the building to see that something was terribly wrong from all the reports that we've heard all the witnesses all the people that worked there all you had to do was walk inside and you could see that something was very wrong and if you actually walk past the lobby into back where these things were happening you would see dead humans in buckets and in jars and you would see all this stuff yet somehow city and state officials didn't notice for 30 years or they did notice and they chose to look the other way and I think clearly that's what happened because either either this either this clinic was completely unregulated nobody checked on its allegedly a medical clinic no regulation no checking on it nothing no oversight 0 for 30 years or there was some oversight there was some regulation and those people chose to look the other way and so actually participated in a cover-up I mean if the media had actually been interested in doing its job and again this is why I didn't want to do its job here but if it if it actually had decided to do its job and and and really dig into this and find out who knew about this this was not happening on an island there was obviously a cover-up going on there were people in the government who had to know about it had to and chose to not do anything about it so how deep did that go well we never found out because they ignore the story but I think the third thing most important the most fundamental reason the most kind of visceral reason why this story is ignored is because this is abortion I mean this is what Gosnell was doing he's abortion it that's all yeah he was doing it when the babies were born as opposed to right before they were born but this is abortion for all of the pretending that there is some dramatic difference between regular old murder and abortion when it comes down to it of course killing an innocent helpless human is killing an innocent helpless human murder is murder is murder is murder after all what is what exactly is the substantive difference between killing a baby moments after it leaves the birth canal and killing it moments before but you know you've got a baby who just emerged from the birth canal the doctor is holding the child we're wine the clock you know a few seconds what and then you know if you rewind the clock and then fast-forward you go back to what is in between the emergence from the birth canal what is happening in that so it's it's a human being you know as soon as it comes out it's a human being you know a person a human being deserving of Rights and dignity and all that kind of stuff and right before that it has none well what exactly has happened what magical mystical thing is happening as the baby comes out of the birth canal to change to fundamentally change it from a from a worthless pointless blob of of lifeless tissue to a human being I mean what exactly is happening well the answer is nothing the difference between the two is simply Geographic the difference is location and that's what it comes down to I think the proponent of abortion sees the Gosnell case and and thinks yeah I mean I guess that's really not too different is it and he knows that and so he looks away and he turns away and he ignores and he doesn't want to dwell on it he doesn't want to see abortion for what it is and he doesn't want us to see you know I'm very glad that Kermit Gosnell was in prison for the rest of his life that's what he deserves he probably deserves something even worse than that he certainly deserves something even worse than that I should say but at the same time you know at the same time the argument that he made in his defense was that was a pretty good argument his argument was well I was just performing abortions which are legal I'm no different from any other abortionist and you know something he's right and that's and that's really why why the left doesn't want us talking about God's now because they know that he's right that he's really no different from any other you go to any any average Planned Parenthood you go to any any abortion clinic and the abortionist there they're no different from Gosnell yeah Gosnell was it was more unorthodox in his approach he didn't care as much about hygiene and and and being sanitary but when it comes down to it they're both killing babies for a living and they both know that that's what they're doing and I think that's why Gosnell didn't care you know for him he wasn't the baby comes out he kills the baby didn't matter to him he'd already signed on to killing babies he does it every day it's what he's in this way he did it every day for 30 years made no different he knows that there's no difference and let me tell you something every abortionist knows it because these people although they are not legitimate doctors at all they're the opposite they're literally the opposite of doctors doctors take the Hippocratic oath do no harm and all they do is harm that's their whole that's their whole life that's what they've dedicated their life to harming children but they do have medical training and they do have scientific medical knowledge and so they know they absolutely know that what Gosnell did is no different from what they do it is exactly the same which is why every abortionist should be locked in a prison cell and that's simply an observation and the conversation that pro-abortion people don't want to have and so they just ignore it it's you know there's nothing that's that's that's the incredible thing with Gosnell this whole time it's like it's not like the left ever came up with some narrative to explain away Gosnell it's not like they know they just ignored it they knew and they know now there's nothing they can say in defense they know that this case is bad for them and for their whole worldview their whole philosophy their ideology everything they know it's terrible for them and so they just say nothing about these are the people that say everything that I've done have something to say about everything on this case they just say nothing that's how terrified they are of it and that's why you should go out and support the movie if you haven't yet thanks for watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed you
