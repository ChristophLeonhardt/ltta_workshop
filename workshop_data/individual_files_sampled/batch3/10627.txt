it has been revealed that death threats were sent to two senior US Republicans by a viewer of a popular political TV program back in April last year triggering an FBI investigation the person in question who's not been named sent the messages on Twitter while watching the Rachel Maddow Show the two targeted were Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruett Pruitt wasn't referred to in the segments but the viewer reportedly disliked his record of suing the agency during his time as a state attorney general according to the case report that's been released the individual in question who has now apologized was drinking while watching this show well protocol on media analyst Lionel joins us live now for his take on this story Lionel hello to you is this a case of someone doing something irresponsible and stupid or is it indicative of the political environment right now in the US or is there anything we can read into this yes all of the above we're losing our minds we're losing our minds somebody watching the Rachel Maddow Show drunk decides he can't take it so he tweets a threat look I have never in 30 years of doing professional commentary in terms of news I thought I remember they hated Nixon and Reagan was crazy and you name it I have never at any level in any consideration seen such acrimony and vile insanity then now I I don't know what it is it's not Rachel Maddow it's not drinking per se it's not it's this climate it's just though everybody is sitting back and the part of the brain that controls judgment and restraint has been somehow electronically ablated because I'm seeing this everywhere in facebook I'm regular conversations I've lost friends some of them I'm glad but I families are not being able to get along it's everywhere and what happens is when you see one person coming out you have to up that and surpass the hatred and vitriol and what it is is we're just collectively encouraging this and this is so common can this be stop it Lionel can this actually be stopped or is this trend just gonna continue and continue well I can be stopped through Mass sedation in the water system perhaps nippy or something I don't know but it is a it is the media it is this mainstream media that is fomenting and creating this and encouraging this at every level each person try Sean Penn in the news coming out and saying it's not it's not enough and it goes back to this is all about Trump hatred because that's where all this started that's where this started if it carries over to everything and instead of and also this this device allows people to act like the heckler in the comedy club the drunk in the back of the room who wants to get to the stage who just can't control it anymore and because there is a feeling of anonymity where there is it and being alone and I'm just focusing with this I see it constantly from people of all ages time is beating us as per usual political on media analyst Lila we appreciate your take so much thank you
