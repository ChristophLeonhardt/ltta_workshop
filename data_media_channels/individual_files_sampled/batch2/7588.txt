so Donald Trump says that maybe you don't need a wall if and might let the dreamers stay anyway most of the right wing is furious but some of the right wing they're still trying to find the waited kisses s so we go to Bill Mitchell I don't know the dude but I guess he's a right anyway he says this is how Trump negotiates it's shocking to some since we're not accustomed to strategic thinking from politicians strategic thinking okay so he's saying like now he agreed with Chuck Boat Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so that later he can disagree with them strategic thinking that's some strategery right there likely not then we go to of course Sean Hannity oh poor shot he's kind of like oh it was that was so bad yeah the tree was he can't stand him but he's got agree with drum that's his job okay so handy says if reports true 100% i blame republicans they caused this they wanted him to fail and now pushed him into the arms of political suicide if true you know in other words this is political suicide this is my god what our Republican 101 is hate immigrants hate Latinos what are you doing you're the Republicans well I can't be by Donald's fault the Donald's a Dear Leader oh they made up do it they push them into the hearts of the Democrats look look at what you made him do okay he goes on to say well Mitch great job to Mitch McConnell you failed so miserably with health care and quote excessive expectations now a president has to deal with Democratic leaders oh you're so sad and miserable Sean like oh you're a natural-born grovel er you're a beta you're a CUC okay so when Trump comes out like does not compute does not compute this is core promise must still kiss his ass I don't know what to do I will blame Mitch McConnell you know anything new this battle drone strike the deal with Pelosi issue his own accord this is one you can't put on McConnell annoy me you know health care that's fair but not this man your your stretches he goes on to say politicians are supposed to keep their word Republicans failed on health care broke their word they have failed POTUS needs to Kip keep his promises he's traveling John gently nudge bonus bonus reward key problems remember the thing with the build a wall build a wall okay and if POTUS doesn't keep that promise and ghost for amnesty it will be the political equivalent of read my lips no new taxes so just a tiny little tweak there but like saying hey remember let's blame Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan but don't do this one last one he says weak Republicans have betrayed voters POTUS needs to stay the course and keep his promises or it's over Pelosi and Schumer can never be trusted but notice he does not say that Donald Trump is betrayed voters that somehow the guys who were to be fair to them and I'm not often fair to them all right oh I am fair to them they just suck anyway in this case they didn't do it man they didn't agree to the deal they weren't part of the deal they had nothing to do with this deal all right I mean media points out if the wall is already there which is what Trump said quote already there was the slogan build a wall just literally licensed for fund renovations to existing border barriers and that is a fair question and one that should be asked of Sean Hannity and others but before we leave this of course we've got to do Fox and Friends because they're like wait it's sean hannity trying to out ass-kiss us we're not gonna let that happen we're gonna bring it on Chaffetz he's gonna have a super weak sauce explanation excuse here let's watch what you need to understand about this is the president doesn't need congressional authority to build the wall it's already there he needs funding so it's solely in the camp of the United States Congress to fund what the president promised he would do he'll build it but Congress has to step up and actually fund it it's already there it's Congress you know what I'm saying Steve Doocy you got to jump in there make it even worse get a load of this this is great what has the wall almost become symbolic I mean I know the president ran on it it was a mantra but at the same time border crossings have gone down dramatically and you were talking about how the border the wall exists in certain forms and there's money to go to it has to come from Congress but do you think we're gonna get to the point where maybe they won't build a wall has it become symbolic symbolically build the wall symbolically build the wall you guys are wonderfully pathetic keep making excuses it's amusing for the rest of us thank you for the entertainment not something I say often to Fox News help us build independent media together TYT Network comm /join
