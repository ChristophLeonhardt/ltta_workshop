breaking news right now the NFL the National Football League making a drastic change in league policy over those player protests in a statement issued a short time ago the NFL outlined the policy which now states in part all team and league personnel on the field shall stand and show respect for the flag in the anthem personnel who choose not to stand for the anthem may stay in the locker room or in a similar location off the field until after the anthem has been performed the protests caught fire after San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the anthem to protest police violence against African Americans protests in support of Kaepernick came from players from several teams throughout the 2016 and 2017 seasons Dave sired as the sports editor for the nation and from NBC Sports Rob's amilcare joining me as well and we also just got our hands on a statement from the NFL Players Association we'll get to that in just a moment but Dave's our and you've been writing about this a lot since it started your initial reaction to the league's decision well people call the NFL the no-fun league sometimes because of the way they crack down on celebrations I guess we can call them the no freedom League now as well look what the NFL owners are doing it's the equivalent of trying to put out a fire with kerosene and what they're showing is that they still don't understand why players are protesting in the first place it's not to protest the anthem it's to Pro it's not to disrespect the anthem it is to protest police violence and racial inequity and this is a crackdown on players more specifically it's a crackdown on black players and that is how it will be read by the players the NFLPA statement is very tough against this policy which they feel like is in violation of the collective bargaining agreement players will speak out against this policy and rebel against this policy and I think you're already seeing fans speak out against this policy because compulsory patriotism is not patriotism Rob the NFLPA again the statement just coming out short time ago the NFL chose not to consult the Union in the development of this new policy policy being in quotation marks their NFL Thayer's have shown their patriotism through their social activism their community service in support of our military and law enforcement and yes through their protests to raise awareness about the issues they care about did the NFL robbed at the end of the day just essentially decided really didn't care what its players thought about the policy well Craig I think what the NFL has done is to get themselves in line with other leaks let's not forget the NBA has had a policy that's very similar to this policy since the 1980s that's why we haven't seen this issue arise in the NBA where of course players do care about the issues of police violence they found other ways to speak out and express themselves on that issue by wearing shirts and pregame shoot arounds and things like that they have not chosen to make their protest about the national anthem because the league rules said they couldn't and I saw the NFLPA statement they didn't say in their statement that this ruling by the NFL was against the collective bargaining agreement they said that they would review it to determine whether anything in it was inconsistent with the CBA and if so at that point they might raise some sort of a grievance but at this point I expect the NFLPA to go along with this because at the end of the day I think everyone realizes this controversy which started two years ago with Colin Kaepernick has not been good for the league it has not been good for the league partners and it needed to go away and I think this was a good way to make that happen you think Rob did this at the end of the day it did in fact hurt NFL ratings that it was responsible for in revenue you think part of the reason was this I mean anytime you got the President of the United States speaking out against the NFL and telling people hey you shouldn't watch games that's not a conversation that the NFL wants to be a part of and that's not a conversation that League partners or anyone else associated with the league want to be a part of so I think this is an issue that listen players will still clearly have the opportunity to express themselves on this issue they have the right according to this unanimous decision by the NFL teams to stay in the locker room and not come out on the field at all if they don't want to be a part of the end if that's their way of showing up you know their feelings or to protest but you know I think there are lots of opportunities for players to speak out on these issues sitting during the national anthem isn't going to be one of them and that is not a new position in sport the NBA has been doing that for years Dave yeah president Trump do you know he's tweet he has tweeted about this a number of times not necessarily recently although it's still early in the day one of those tweets though you know if a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL or other leagues he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our great American flag and should stand for the national anthem if not your fire find something else to do yeah how's hiring people from their job for not standing for the national anthem it's disgusting and it's an attack on people's constitutional freedoms I I disagree with with my colleague on a couple of points that he just said first and foremost I do expect the NFLPA to raise a major stink about this they have stated on previous occasions that they do believe that this is a violation of the collective bargaining agreement and they don't believe that the collective bargaining agreement can be changed unilaterally also it has to be kept in mind that one of the reasons why NBA players haven't protested during the anthem is that they have felt like that they have been heard that there has been constant communication between their union leader Michelle Roberts and the NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and that just hasn't been the case in the NFL that's felt like much more that there's been a constant level of disrespect from the beginning so I don't expect NFL players to be quiet about this I think they'll see it as a form of a ratio of their protests a silencing of raising the issue of police violence and they're going to respond accordingly with more protests one thing really quickly here before I let you guys go Dave because Rob did bring up the NBA and yeah it does seem from the outside that while you have two professional sports leagues you have one league that perhaps if not encouraging social activism not erecting as many barriers the NBA is that a fair assessment or more to it than that is the difference is that the NBA players feel hurt I mean I've interviewed NBA players about this and particularly around protesting during the anthem you know dr. King once called riots the language of the unheard protest is in many respects and protesting during the anthem is the language of the unheard NFL players felt like they were not being heard and and particularly with Colin Kaepernick being kept out of the league and NBA players felt like they were being heard by the Commissioner by NBA owners and so you've had a much different reaction all right we'll have to leave it there certainly something folks going to be talking about a lot here over the next day or so mr. Simo care always good to have you sir thank you for your time Dave Zirin thanks as always as well hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
