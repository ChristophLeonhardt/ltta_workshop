PATTERSON JOINS US NOW.  
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS AND 
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE 
PERSON BEING CHARGED? 
>>   IT IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT.  
IT CONFIRMS MANY THINGS WE 
SUSPECTED FROM PREVIOUS 
INVESTIGATIONS.  
IT ALSO CONFIRMS THINGS THAT WE 
SAW A HINT OF IN PREVIOUS 
INDICTMENTS.  
THIS IS A DIRECT CONNECTION OF 
THE DOTS BETWEEN THE MONEY  --  
THE FUNDERS, AND THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HELPED -- 
THE HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT 
HELPED EXECUTE THE 2016 
MEDDLING.  
IT ALSO CONFIRMS MANY OF THE 
THINGS WE SUSPECTED ABOUT THE 
2018 CAMPAIGN.  
THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER, SOCIAL 
MEDIA COMPANIES AND TECH FIRMS 
FOUND EVIDENCE OF WHAT THEY 
CALLED MEDDLING OR TAMPERING ON 
THEIR SERVERS.  
THIS INCLUDES MICROSOFT, 
FACEBOOK, GOOGLE AND TWITTER. 
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY SORT OF 
INDICATION OF WHO WAS BEHIND 
THIS MEDDLING OR TAMPERING.  
NOW WE KNOW. 
>>   WHEN YOU BREAK DOWN THE 
TECH PERSPECTIVE, WHAT EXACTLY 
DID THEY DO AND HOW DID THEY 
ACHIEVE THIS? 
>>   THEY USED WHAT WE CALLED 
PROXY SERVERS.  
THESE ARE COMMONLY USED IN THE 
WEST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE 
SECURE AND SAFE WHEN YOU 
NAVIGATE THE WEB.  
IT IS KIND OF LIKE AN ENCRYPTED 
TUNNEL BETWEEN YOUR COMPUTER 
AND THE EXTERNAL INTERNET.  
SO THEY USE PROXY CENTERS TO 
CONCEAL THEIR IDENTITY AND SET 
UP DOMAIN NAMES, HOST WEBSITES. 
OFTEN WHEN WE HEARD THE TERM, 
FAKE NEWS IN 2016 AND 2017, 
THAT REQUIRES WEB 
INFRASTRUCTURE.  
THIS WEB INFRASTRUCTURE WAS 
BUILT ON SERVERS AND FUNDED 
THROUGH RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS. 
>>   DO WE KNOW WHAT SOCIAL 
MEDIA PLATFORMS THEY USED AND 
HOW MUCH MONEY THEY SPENT ON 
THIS TYPE OF A CAMPAIGN? 
>>   WE KNOW IT COST ABOUT $35 
MILLION ACCORDING TO THE 
INDICTMENT. 
$10 MILLION WAS SPECIFICALLY 
FOR THE 2016 CAMPAIGN.  
THIS WEB INFRASTRUCTURE WAS 
AGAIN WITH THE LARGE TECH 
FIRMS.  
IN FACT, YOU CAN BUY A SERVER 
ON ANY NUMBER OF PLATFORMS BUT 
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO REACH A 
LARGE AUDIENCE, YOU NEED CLOUD 
INFRASTRUCTURE.  
SO WE LOOK AT DIFFERENT TYPES 
OF COMPANIES THAT BUSINESSES 
USE EVERY DAY TO SET UP 
WEBSITES  --  WEBSITES.  
I DON'T WANT TO SAY 
SPECIFICALLY FACEBOOK, TWITTER, 
GOOGLE AND MICROSOFT BECAUSE 
THEY WERE NOT NAMED IN THE 
INDICTMENT, BUT THIS IS 
DEFINITELY WHERE SOME OF THE 
PROPAGANDA OR INFLUENCE 
CAMPAIGN CONTENT WAS.  
THE WEBSITES LIKELY LIVED ON 
CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDED 
BY SOME OF THESE COMPANIES. 
>>   WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AN 
INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN LIKE THIS, 
WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THEY WERE 
TRYING TO TACKLE? 
>>   THINK ABOUT A HOT BUTTON 
ISSUE IN THE UNITED STATES OVER 
THE LAST 18-36 MONTHS.  
THIS INCLUDES THE WOMEN'S 
MARCH.  
IT INCLUDES COLIN KAEPERNICK 
AND THE NFL.  
IT INCLUDES CHARLOTTESVILLE.  
IN INCLUDES ALMOST EVERY MAJOR 
ISSUE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN 
DIVIDED ON.  
IT IS NOT A CONSPIRACY.  
IT ISRAEL.  
NOW WE HAVE THE INDIVIDUALS 
NAMED IN THESE CAMPAIGNS.  
IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT WHO IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR PUSHING CONTENT 
THAT DIVIDES AMERICANS, NOW WE 
KNOW WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THIS.

FOR JOINING US.
