The Washington Post has spoken to a number of White House aides who wish to remain anonymous and based on these conversations with the aides Trump has told confidants that a government shutdown might actually be good for him because he'll find a way to place the blame on Democrats even though Democrats do not have control of Congress at all so Trump has told his confidants that a government shutdown could be good for him politically and is focusing on his hardline immigration stance as a way to win back supporters who are unhappy with his outreach to Democrats this fall so if you could remember Trump did have a meeting with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and it seemed like things were on the up-and-up and they were getting along and then later he got a little criticism from the right for negotiating with them and so now he is trying to respond to that with his hardline policy regarding immigration now in the spring he tweeted that he would like a good government shutdown and thought it would be useful to him he tweeted about that so there's another example of him getting in trouble by his own tweets because he doesn't know how to stop and and just shut it but he changed his tune this fall he mused to others in the White House meeting that he thought about the the debt ceiling often used as a negotiating point in complex spending talks should be ended for good and has told advisers that a shutdown could make the administration look impotent so so he goes from thinking it might be good to maybe this isn't a good idea maybe he's gonna look at make us look bad he can't make up his mind and I think my favorite quote was actually from Schumer where he's like we're just trying to catch him on a good day cuz we don't know where he's gonna land yeah that was Dick Durbin who's in charge of this pretty other thing for the Democrats here I have it cuz I thought it was so funny hear it Durbin said he has a tendency to move back and forth we hope we catch him at a good moment yeah meaning because Durbin said right after the the inauguration Trump told Durbin himself he said oh no no we'll take care of those kids referring to the dreamers like don't worry right and then and in the whole reason for that Nancy we'll see Joshua meeting that got so much press with Trump was because they actually do need to Democrats a little bit to be fair I'll explain that in a second to pass a budget and the deal was you'll help us pass the budget and then we'll make sure that the dreamers can stay and then we're not going to deport them right so then he Trump gets a ton of hate from the right wing like why not and we want our budget we want everything of course they always want everything right so Trump reads that in other words Steve Bannon sent it to him okay and so then he's like oh wait he's literally apparently told an advisor I look like a chump here yeah that's right he's such a child like you didn't realize that it wouldn't play well with your right-wing base to make a deal with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer of course it would if if I was in a situation I'd go okay but I'm willing to pay that price because we actually knew do need to make sure the government doesn't shut down we do need a budget and maybe I can get votes in the middle from doing this dreamer thing but he doesn't get it he's like oh I don't know Nancy and Chuck gave me a good deal and then afterwards he got good press out of it and he even called him and said hey did you see all the good press were getting and then he gets bad press from Breitbart in other places he's like oh my god it turns out I look like a chump no never mind I'm not doing that deal we're gonna have a good government shutdown yeah look what I think is interesting though is his interpretation Trump's interpretation of things and how different it is from Republicans so for instance you know based on what these White House aides are telling the press Trump thinks that he could actually use a government shutdown to his advantage which is ridiculous because again Republicans are charging a Republican president you have Republicans in charge of Congress shutting down or even a partial shutdown of the government hurts a lot of people that is not good for your poll numbers but in his mind I'll just blame it on Democrats I mean who knows he's like a master manipulator so maybe he'd be able to do that it could look it could work it could work and III make that point because when you look at the people who support him through thick and thin what is the one thing that they really want a wall that they really want the wall and getting on here do you remember the poll that came out a few weeks ago about his his support or how they don't believe the media they believe not flat-out that we that we have the media has an opinion that we make stuff that we fabricate stories yes so and these are the people who are gonna believe whatever he says that's what he wants you to keep quickly going back to that survey seventy six percent of the Republican Party who was surveyed said we believe that the media fabricates stories about Trump's seventy six percent that's insane all right so let me agree in disagree with you guys Trump is not a master manipulator he's a moron he keeps flipping because he's a child and doesn't know what he's doing oh I do look good oh no I look bad okay I'm for this job for that he's a moron he just he has no idea what he's doing but I do agree with you guys that it could work and and so because it's you know more than the wall stuff I think that the thing that his voters love most about him is strength so like when you when you vote when you pull in a pathway to citizenship it actually pulls really really well and and even among Republicans they like did moat you'd be surprised at how well pathway to citizenship holds among Republicans it's not that they're like no I I must have an 18-foot wall etc they just like him being strong and standing up to people that's why it could work because I'm so strong I'm shutting the government down well whose government is it it's yours you clown okay I know but I'm shutting it down well you look strong nice job well it could also be about who's gonna flinch first yes in that showdown and who has a tendency which party has a tendency to flinch first excellent point and we all know that it's the Democrats and if he gets them to flinch it'll be so he's gonna get them to flinch oh my god that'll be pathetic cuz think about it I mean him tying this entire shutdown situation to the immigration policy is it I think it's really gonna work because if he says look I mean they're not willing to negotiate with us uh you know regard this issue because of my hardline stance on immigration I mean come on even people on the Left I'm not saying progressives but some people on the left are in favor of stronger immigration policy so that is part of what got him elected it so but look so let's be fair by the way yes Republicans control the whole government but why are we even having a conversation about the Democrats because they do have a little bit of leverage here and there so a the if they if the Republicans didn't need them at all they could just they wouldn't need to worry about a government shutdown so why did the Democrats have leverage first of all in the house there's a bunch of extreme right-wing Republicans who are like no I vote no on the budget because it didn't give the rich enough I'm gonna call that freedom I want more freedom for my donors right and so they're gonna vote no on the budget which then means that in even in the house the Republicans need Democrats to vote YES on their draconian budget okay to pass so then okay then the Democrat then they have to get Democratic votes and in the Senate the Democrats could filibuster the budget okay now if you ask me why would a Democrat agree to this Republican budget I say no right okay I'll flip it on you I hear I'm not gonna flinch I want daca and that's not all I also want to make sure that we protect net neutrality unless say I'm not an unreasonable Republican oh I want everything to that that are my priorities even though we're in the minority right but I would have a list of two to five things that that I want and I wouldn't say ahead of time oh by the way I'm kidding I'm just gonna take only one but look at the negotiation by the Democrats to begin with they only started with daca so your only choice is either daca or Nothing right you either protect the dreamers or you get nothing at all right that's already a poor negotiation stance so at the end you guys might be right even though the Demery they need the democrats the democrats might vote for a terrible Republican budget and by this by the way put themselves on the hook for that budget and get almost nothing in return so as as foolish as Donald Trump is that his advisors like Steve banning telling him punch the Democrats in the face you almost certainly get away with it it might be decent advice you know Trump though he does get one thing instincts how people feel about things that along with strength which is the point that you made goes what protection and that's what the border symbolizes protection we're gonna keep the bad guys away the bad guys that are threatening you the bad guys that killed a Kate Steinle in San Francisco this so that's why I think if he ties that it's gonna work we'll see it is frightening to see but last thing on this a lot of the Republicans and the people in the White House don't want them to do it and and I think all the reporters get this wrong so it they don't they mean well but they so they say well I mean I talk to my source inside the White House and they're concerned about the budget not you know if the budget isn't passed then parts of the government will shut down and that'll hurt Americans they're Republicans when's the last time you cared about hurting Americans no it'll hurt the stock market and so that's why some of the Republicans are in a panic like wait wait wait wait wait if we have a government shutdown the market goes down well be careful be careful that's why your panic comments like this when Senator John Cornyn of Texas says it seems like an abdication of responsibility like don't do it Donald Lindsey Graham says we'd look like crazy people to shut down the government in light of all of our problems in other words those guys got the memo from their donors don't shut it down this is gonna hurt the markets but Trump in that case it's too thick-headed to realize it so it's a combination it's not clear win for Trump even if they do a government shutdown even if we're right about our speculation about the weakness of Democrats but if the Democrats holds strong and the markets go down and all the Republican senators start to panic we actually can win and we can get protection for dreamers but that would require the Democrats to stay strong was just luck if you like this video you'll love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT Network comm slash join
