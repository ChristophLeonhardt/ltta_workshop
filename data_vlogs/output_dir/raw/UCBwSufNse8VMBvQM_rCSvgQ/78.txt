00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,319

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,649
What time is it right now mom Oh I'd say it's half past four.

47
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,619
It's half past four and I woke up thirty minutes ago because apparently when I tell Mum to wake me up... SHE DOESN'T DO IT

48
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,510
You thought I'd want to stay in bed until four after this clip I might have to go inside and

49
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,919
Actually get some prank King merch on because I don't want to where this out in public

50
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,799
I'm not a queen and talking about the merch guys

51
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,229

56
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:00,119
No since Kara went,  there's been no wee's or poos, but maybe It's Kiera

57
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:04,479
I'm a little bit angry at you well seriously Kiera since you've gone

58
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:10,779
There hasn't been a single wee or poo from Puggo  so we came up with a theory that it was you is this true

59
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,179
Well there you go boys and girls? We've revealed the truth everybody comment down below Kiera wee's and poos

60
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,930
Puggo----! I think

61
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,330
Now the thing is Puggo, we all thought it was you who was erm who was making the mess on the floor

62
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:34,959
But obviously now. We know that it wasn't you it was um. It was Kiera. We all feel bad, buddy

63
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,289
we all thought it was you and we just want to UM all the unit just

64
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,720
Apologize to you because obviously you didn't deserve all the times off you got over Kira's dirty

65
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:48,639
Doing, so I guess I'm sorry Puggo. I love you

66
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,519
Anyway boys and girls right now?

67
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,849
We are going off to Ikea, and you guys probably know what that means meatballs no

68
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,839
I wasn't talking about that. I was however. They are pretty cool that means that

69
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,999
I'm probably gonna get kicked out usually when I go to Ikea

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,009
I end up getting told off, but I'm really on my best behavior. This time Mum So boys and girls

71
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,780
You know how in the last video I uploaded I disappeared from social media for 48 hours

72
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,179

73
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,590

86
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:14,389
But thank you so much for the support. I really really appreciate it, but now let's go to Ikea, baby

101
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,310
This is how he and/or I don't believe you. I just keep telling you Morgan. This is not your room you saw him

102
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,039
It's my room

103
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:47,169
boys and girls

104
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:55,210
It's me both time mum I've got a little challenge for you. Okay, how many meatballs, can you get any mouths in one mouth?

105
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,990

Don't buy it don't buy it go and get the food and get a food the burden. No way oh my god

108
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,330
She's going for another oh, no you are joking me is that the fear?

109
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,460
Gosh I tell she's couldn't take you balls

110
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,210
I'll give it that what?

111
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:35,780
So we've just come to look at a new mirror for the house right I saw this one and I was like no I mean

112
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,650
It's pretty cool. Like it's not amazing

113
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:43,100
I'm like maybe I'll get it, but then I looked at the name, and this is why saw God

114
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,080
Morgon this mirror is literally called God

115
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,400
Morgan I mean

116
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,600
The mirrors got a point. I have I kept on flipping God, so of course you know what that means and I get it

117
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,299
I'm a dad a god Morgan to my house so guys this looks like just you know a normal Charlie

118
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,300
You know nothing out of the ordinary here

119
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,720
Probably the weirdest Charlie I've ever seen in my life, okay, so boys and girls

120
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,330
we are back home right now, and I think you all know what time it is, it's

121
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,850
break time

122
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,530
Now just before we start the prank. I wanna let you guys know that I have now officially

123
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,559
Got the new design of the new merch sorter no guys. I don't ask you a question

124
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,820
If there's one word that I always say that you guys always notice me saying well. What is that word comment down below?

125
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:42,020
What the word is right now bros? I'll give you a five seconds

126
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,730
Okay

127
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:55,469
Time's up of course the word is bro like I call my dad, bro. I literally call that mom, bro

128
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:02,640
Like I don't call anybody by their names. I call Kara bro, so I thought 3 2 1 bye

129
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,539
Why not put it on some merch?

130
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,800
So yeah bros bromwich coming very very soon. It's gonna be amazing

131
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,159
It's also gonna be available in two new colors, and I can't wait for that

132
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,760
But now let me taught you guys about the prank now as you guys know Kara is actually really really hard to prank

133
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:27,180
She's a good person at spotting when I'm gonna prank her I guess and I was thinking really hard

134
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:34,889
I was like what prank could I do that. She just wouldn't notice and then it came to me. Why not do a prank which

135
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:40,978
Nobody is doing anymore and then so Larry takes prank was the perfect idea to you boys and girls

136
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,479
I'm gonna be trying to prank her with God's plan by Drake now the

137
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,079
Situation with me and Kara is it's really really complicated

138
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,630
We're now

139
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,030
Birthday boy. We're in a tricky place right now, but we seem to be on really really good terms

140
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:04,530
So obviously that means there's not the best idea to prank her, but I'm stupid so I'm gonna do it anyway

141
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,460
so yeah

142
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,269
I text her hey just to make sure she was around and she's here

143
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,729
So I guess let's get started so the way I'm gonna do this I'm gonna put a little bit

144
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,050
You know one more spin on it. I'm gonna say I can put any of the lines in whatever order

145
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:25,500
I want but they have to be from the song okay on the second thought this is gonna be a lot harder than I thought

146
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:29,459
These lyrics are extremely hard to work with bad things

147
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:32,609
There's a lot of bad things that they wish in on me now

148
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,959
I feel like this has got a conversation moving into a little bit of a direction however

149
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:43,589
there's no they lurk in this song which is like a high like a Hello is just straight in there, but

150
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,680
Let's see what happens. I guess okay

151
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:55,769
No, clue was good harmony the conversation went from hey to bad things. There's a lot of bad things or the original me yeah

152
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:03,328
She's probably gonna realize guys, but let's try our best okay, so she said she's message. She said her

153
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:08,489
Probably the realization that I'd expect what do you mean? She has no clue?

154
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:14,279
Good thing is we survive one round without her knowing it surprise makes Larry come to go fall. Oh

155
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:20,849
Okay, okay, she's - she's typing? I'm scared. I'm very scared

156
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:27,719
I don't understand mags. Are you okay hold back? What oh, there's just a question okay?

157
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,569
This is where it gets a little bit awkward when they ask a question

158
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,409
You have the response, but how can I respond to requests?

159
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:41,010
It's very all about the look. Okay. I think now I'm gonna go with someone's watching this

160
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,359
Close because like kind of

161
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:52,079
Links in yes, okay. I've Center no and there you go. She's typing oh

162
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,909
Okay, she's getting worried that is definitely a worried care reply oh
