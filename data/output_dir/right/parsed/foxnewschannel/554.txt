>> PROSECUTORS AS
ADMINISTRATORS OF JUSTICE
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO
PROTECT THE INNOCENT AND ARE
PROHIBITED FROM OFFERING ANY
EVIDENCE THAT IS UNTRUE.
WE HAVE NOW LEARNED AND WILL
PROVE THAT BILL COSBY WAS
DENIED HIS RIGHT TO A FAIR
TRIAL BECAUSE THE D.A. OF
MONTGOMERY COUNTY, KEVIN
STEELE USED FALSIFIED
EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM.
AFTER BEING TIPPED OFF BY A
RECENT ONLINE PUBLICATION
THAT A TAPE RECORDING
MR. STEELE PLAYED DURING
TRIAL WAS DOCTORED.
MR. COSBY RETAINED A
FORENSIC EXPERT TO CONDUCT
AN AUDIO AUTHENTICITY
ANALYSIS OF THE RECORDING.
DEANNA CONSTAND, THE MOTHER
OF ANDREA CONSTAND HAS
SURREPTITIOUSLY AND
ILLEGALLY MADE THE RECORDING
OF MR. COSBY IN 2005 WITHOUT
HIS KNOWLEDGE.
OR CONSENT.
THAT RECORDING WAS PROVIDED
TO BRUCE CASTER WHILE HE WAS
D.A. OF MONTGOMERY COUNTY.
MR. CASTER DETERMINED THAT
DEANNA CONSTAND
SURREPTITIOUS RECORDING
CONSTITUTED A POTENTIAL
FELONY UNDER PENNSYLVANIA'S
LAW WHICH REQUIRED
MS. CONSTAND TO OBTAIN
MR. COSBY'S CONSENT TO THE
RECORDING.
YEARS LATER, IN 200414,
KEVIN STEELE BEAT MR. CASTER
FOR D.A. BY UNETHICALLY
ATTACKING HIM FOR NOT
PROSECUTING MY HUSBAND.
THEIR ACTOR USED THE ILLEGAL
RECORDING IN BOTH TRIALS
CLAIMING THAT IT WAS AN
AUTHENTIC RECORDING OF THE
2005 CONVERSATION.
MR. STEELE RELIED HEAVILY ON
THE RECORDING IN BOTH
TRIALS, ULTIMATELY
CONVINCING THE JURY AND IN
THE SECOND TRIAL TO RETURN A
VERDICT OF GUILTY.
EARLIER THIS MONTH ON
SEPTEMBER 12TH, 2018, AN
ONLINE PUBLICATION REPORTED
THAT A MONTGOMERY COUNTY
COURT OFFICIAL, WHO
REQUESTED ANONYMITY HAD
REVEALED THAT THE ORIGINAL
RECORDING MADE BY DEANNA
CONSTAND WAS DOCTORED AND
CONTAINED INFORMATION THAT
WOULD EXONERATE MR. COSBY.
THE DEFENSE TEAM IMMEDIATELY
SENT ITS COPY OF THE
RECORDING TO A FORENSIC
EXPERT WHO AFTER EXTENSIVE
ANALYSIS HAS UNEQUIVOCALLY
CONCLUDED, QUOTE:  THIS IS
NOT A TRUE REPRESENTATION OF
THE ORIGINAL CONTENT OR
CONVERSATION.
WITHOUT QUESTION, THIS IS
NOT AN AUTHENTIC RECORDING,
END QUOTE.
AT NO TIME BEFORE OR DURING
THE TRIAL DID THE D.A.
DISCLOSE THAT RECORDING WAS
INAUTHENTIC, MUCH LESSES
THAT THAT IT HAD BEEN
FALSIFIED.
AFTER THE MEDIA REPORTS SUR
FOSSAD ON SEPTEMBER 12TH,
MONTGOMERY COUNTY DETECTIVES
ACKNOWLEDGED AND CONFIRMED
TO THE DEFENSE TEAM THAT
THEY COULD NOT AUTHENTICATE
THE RECORDING AND DID NOT
KNOW WHO MADE THE ORIGINAL
RECORDING.
I MR. COSBY'S DEFENSE TEAM
WILL BE FILING A MOTION
SEEKING IMMEDIATE RELEASE
FOR THE PROSECUTION'S USE OF
THIS FALSIFIED EVIDENCE.
THE D.A.'S USE OF THIS
FALSIFIED AUDIO CLIP AT
TRIAL IS DEEPLY PREJUDICIAL.
YET, IT REPRESENTS JUST ONE
OF MANY ISSUES THAT RESULTED
IN THE DENIAL OF MR. COSBY'S
