POSSIBLE DIRECTION. LELAND: HEARING WHO HAD TO YOU THE U.S. MILITARY IS TRYING TO COUNTER THE CHINESE THREAT. GILLIAN TURNER, THANKS SO MUCH. ELIZABETH: AFTER CALLING OFF THE ANTICIPATED SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-UN, THE PRESIDENT SAYS IT COULD BE BACK ON. HERE TO DISCUSS IT AND OF COURSE, THE POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONSES, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, AND BRIE, START WITH YOU. NORTH KOREA OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN ABLE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF REWARD THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS ON A GLOBAL SCALE FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR FOR A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. DO YOU SUSPECT THAT'S MOTIVATION FOR THE JUNE 12TH SUMMIT TO ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE? I DEFINITELY THINK SO, BUT YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER KNOW WITH NORTH KOREA, THAT'S THE THING. AND I THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR DONALD TRUMP TO HAVE CANCELED THE SUMMIT IN THE FIRST PLACE. NORTH KOREA WAS REPORTEDLY THREATENING TO HAVE A NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN WITH THE UNITED STATES IF THE MEETING DIDN'T GO WELL. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN ENTERING A NEGOTIATING TABLE TO BE HONEST AND FOR US TO ENTER WITH THE POSITION OF STRENGTH, RIGHT? I MEAN, THE REALITY THAT NORTH KOREA IS A COUNTRY THAT IS IMPLODING INTERNALLY AND THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS, RIGHT? SO I THINK WE NEED TO ENTER THE NEGOTIATING TABLE BEING HONEST WITH ONE ANOTHER AND NOT TREATING THEM IN THE POSITION AS THEY ARE IN AND US ENTERING WITH STRENGTH. I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTOOD THAT AND I WAS HONESTLY, I MEAN, HAPPY TO SEE THAT HE ENDED UP CANCELING THE SUMMIT WHEN NORTH KOREA WAS ENTERING WITH THAT TYPE OF AN ATTITUDE. ELIZABETH: ROBIN, AND OBVIOUSLY, YOUR LAST NAME, YOU YOU'VE BEEN ON THE SHOW BEFORE, I APOLOGIZE. AND SECOND OF ALL, I ASSUME YOU DO NOT AGREE. BRIE BROUGHT UP VERY GOOD POINTS AND MY MAIN CONCERN, WITH THIS BEING ON JUNE 12TH, THERE WERE SO MANY MOVING PARTS TO THIS, YOU KNOW, IT'S TAKING ME BACK TO MY ACTIVE DUTY DAYS, KIND OF SHOOTING MOVING TARGETS HERE AND I DON'T THINK WE HAD ENOUGH TIME TO PUT THIS TOGETHER. AND I THINK IT'S A SMART MOVE TO DELAY THIS AND DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T LIKE TO EXPOSE HIS PLAYING CARDS. BOLTON DID NO SERVICE TO HIM BY HIS COMMENTS WE WERE GOING TO USE THE LIBYA MODEL. I KNOW IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT, BUT THE PERCEPTION FROM KIM JONG-UN WAS CERTAINLY HE WAS GOING TO END UP LIKE GADHAFI, DEAD ON THE MEAT FACTORY FLOOR. IF WE SEE KIM JONG-UN MAKE A MORE AGGRESSIVE STANCE AS HE DID WEEKS AND MONTHS AGO, THEN WHAT IS MY QUESTION? IF WE SEE HIM SORT OF, YOU KNOW, MEETING WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT AND THERE'S EFFORTS FOR IT TO TAKE PLACE, BUT THAT COULD CHANGE, SO THEN WHAT? IT CHANGES ALL THE TIME, BUT LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THE TWO OF THEM IN THE PAST. YOU KNOW, THAT THE NAME CALLING, THE DOTAR AND PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLING HIM SHORT AND FAT. AND IT'S BASICALLY FLUID. I'M PRETTY SURE WE'LL END UP GETTING THERE AND THAT'S TO THE BETTERMENT OF ALL AMERICANS. THIS ISN'T ALONG PARTY LINES AT ALL, THIS IS WHAT'S BEST FOR AMERICA, SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS HERE. ELIZABETH: YOU KNOW, BRIE, I WANT TO BRING IN ONE I WANT TO WEAVE CHINA INTO THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY, THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT XI FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. HOW BIG OF A ROLE SHOULD THEY PLAY OR SHOULD THEY NOT PLAY A ROLE AT ALL? THEY ABSOLUTELY SHOULD PLAY A BIG ROLE. AT THE END OF THE DAY, CHINA IS THE COUNTRY THAT'S PROPPING UP KIM JONG-UN'S REGIME. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE NEED TO BE HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH THEM. IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT CHINA IS NOT IN A POSITION WHERE THEY WANT TO GIVE UP THEIR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE AND THEY'RE RAPIDLY EXPANDING IT. WE HEARD FROM GILLIAN A FEW MOMENTS AGO THE WAY THAT THEY'RE DEVELOPING WEAPONS IN THE ISLANDS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA AND POSITION THEMSELVES, YOU KNOW, AS A GLOBAL SUPER POWER, WHICH THEY ARE AND TRYING TO KIND OF HAVE THIS CONFLICT WITH US AND TRY TO SAY WE'RE BIGGER THAN YOU, WE'RE EXPANDING, DOING THESE THINGS AND ALL THAT HAVE IS A RAPID CHANGE IN FOREIGN POLICY DIRECTION IN THE PAST DECADE WE'RE SEEING. I THINK WE NEED TO RESPOND TO IT AND SAY, THIS NEEDS TO STOP AND WE NEED TO HAVE A REALISTIC CONVERSATION ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON THERE, SO, DEFINITELY, 100% IMPORTANT TO INVOLVE CHINA AND GET THEM AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE AS WELL. ELIZABETH: ROBIN, I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT EVEN TWEETED THAT THE BORDER HAS BECOME MORE POROUS. OBVIOUSLY, HE'S REFERRING TO THE SANCTIONS BEING LIFTED FOR NORTH KOREA, COMING FROM CHINA, MEANING THAT THEY REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWING THROUGH AND BEING AS HARD ON NORTH KOREA AS THEY SHOULD. I WANT TO I HAVE GO YOU THE LAST WORD ON CHINA'S INVOLVEMENT AND POSSIBILITY OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT GOING FORWARD. IT'S SORT OF TROUBLESOME. YOU KNOW WHAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST ARE THE SECRETIVE MEETINGS. AND SEEMS LIKE CHINA IS TRYING TO DO A POWER PLAY. I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WANT THE POWER, BUT KIM JONG-UN IS A NOTORIOUS LIAR. CONDOLEEZZA RICE KNOWS VERY WELL THIS, SO IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE HOW THIS IS GOING TO TURN OUT.
