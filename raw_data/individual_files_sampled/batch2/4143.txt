NBC News has now confirmed with the Washington Post first reported this afternoon that the Pentagon has been asked to make room for 20,000 migrant children on military bases 20,000 migrant children on military bases that's something the Trump administration is seriously preparing for starting as early as next month this news coming as questions mount over the fate to the children already separated from their parents at the border before Trump ended the policy with an executive order yesterday many of those children have been sent thousands of miles away from where they last saw their parents at least 13 states say their housing those separated children the Trump administration has still offered no clear plan to reunite these children with their parents NBC's Jacob Soboroff who's been incredible on this story since the earliest days joins us at the table and NBC's Julianne's Lee who's been equally incredible following this story and the government's response joins us from Washington what do we not understand about what's going on down there I mean I think we all really clearly understand what's going on which is there are 23 hundred kids so we don't know what's going to happen to them I mean to me that that's the biggest thing that I can't stop thinking about I'm I just got back to New York from being down there on and off over the last six days the six days ago I went inside that Brownsville shelter with 1500 young boys there's been 22 hours a day inside a Walmart and then on Sunday on Father's Day I went inside this Detention Facility where you see little kids sitting in a cage on the floor and I just can't stop thinking about what happened to those kids where are they today Bill DeBlasio said on it on our air and MSNBC 239 of them or here in New York City and when are they ever going to see their their parents again and we just do not have answers despite the fact we continue to ask every day multiple times today let's part of the map again of all the states so they're now spread out over at least 13 states that we know of yeah I talked to a former national security official who said that and the only analogy here is in tracking people release so when you look at people that we deport they don't leave with SIM cards right and it the idea that we're going to take children from these 13 states and reconnect them with their parents who've been deported but not and you have to assume that a lot of them left in not conditions that they have a forwarding address and not only do they not have a forwarding address we're not talking about people that are walking away with bags of I mean these are some poor people coming from desperate situations and don't have money to hire high-priced attorneys much less any attorney start calling up the United States to say hey do you know where my kids are they're given a piece of paper which we were handed we were in that Detention Center that said call this 800 number push 1 for English 2 for Spanish good luck you've also I saw your tweets last night HHS the government distributed images of two shelters one girls the other with girls and babies they tell you that they were released after airing on Fox we're not showing those pictures until you or members of the media appreciate that because you know how first of all that why are they giving them out to Fox News first and having the HHS secretary go there for basically a press conference on Fox News to give this administration side of the story why don't you let us in so that we can provide some context to the images that we are seeing out there and to HHS is credit I do believe in the coming days we're gonna get into a couple of these shelters we're scheduling that right now but why is it taking so long why is it one week since we got into the first one months after the policy started have we been let in there from day one we wouldn't be talking about 2300 kids that will now possibly forever be without their parents we might be talking about far far less and Julie you've reported on ice you you've broken a lot of news about how it is not just possible but but but likely that many of these families will never be reunited that's true when we talk to the former acting director of ice John sand Wegg who was overseeing the border crisis that was not self-inflicted but occurred around 2014 when a lot of families and unaccompanied children started coming up from Central America and he saw in some cases that there were families pulled apart for other reasons than just a legal entry a misdemeanor but they were pulled apart and that he says in some cases families separation is permanent and when I wrote that story Nicole ice got back to me and said well look we do everything in our power we if a parent is going to be deported they can request that their child's meet them but then I got into some of the technicalities well what if they have to leave very quickly because they're being deported they're on the next plane out you know what about if they don't know where their child is are they given number two reach your specific child are they even updated on what state their child might be moved to her from and they couldn't answer those questions and so but seems like there might be some processes in place like that hotline that Jacob mentioned there's really no systematic way to track down 2300 children and reunite them with their parents overnight and even more importantly where would they stay a lot of these parents are still waiting to have their day in court federal court for their charges or immigration court which takes way longer sometimes those cases can be set years into the future so where they is there a way to get them from Marshalls custody into the ice family detention centers with their children and I don't think that this government would be in a hurry to do that because they are already so pressed for space we know that there's only a little over 3,000 beds available for families right now and they're pretty much at capacity and so that's why they're trying to expand by 20,000 with the Defense Department I mean what impetus would they have to reunite all of these people and space it just isn't available right now I don't I don't know when or how they'll do it let me put up a tweet from my former colleague mark Salter the senior adviser to John McCain who wrote if we had a functioning Congress the relevant committees would call the HHS secretary to appear ask how many shelters and where they are and threatened to cut off all money until they were open to members have cut to the hill and depress scrutiny that's certainly the case in the old days when there was controversy around Bush era terrorism policies when there was controversy around the influx of unaccompanied minors during the Obama years do you have any sense that there's anyone on Capitol Hill in leadership that that would like to see any of these government agencies held to account you think anyone wants to ask any questions senator bill Nelson from Florida was turned away from a shelter not gained access is anybody up there alarmed by what's happening yes they're alarmed but it seems that the anger at least the temperature has cooled a bit since the executive order it was signed yesterday we saw a lot of people Orrin Hatch comes to mind a lot of people who are definitely immigration hardliners John Cornyn come out and say that separating families is wrong but we haven't heard as much from them since that executive order was signed Nicole and I think it's because they were already an uncomfortable position of attacking the president for one of his policies but we need people to stay on this like you're staying on this story and continue to ask these questions because you just can't let 2300 children disappear because they happen to come into the into this country in between two dates that happen to have one of the toughest policies that we've ever seen that is the dumbest political Republicans have been they've lost their minds that is the dumbest analysis of a scandal I've ever heard am i it just started started yesterday when he admitted it was too stupid even for him the scandal started yesterday didn't end what is wrong with them and this is where as much as coverage has been provided on this issue I'm not sure the American people still realize exactly what happened the United States government split up families this is very different than the surge of unaccompanied minors in 2014 I was in Congress we wrestled with should we provide additional infrastructure resources for the border do we bring in additional judges do we change the system so instead of lastin first-out we go to first in first out quickly adjudicate people look those are policy decisions we've got to decide as a country the notion that we need to have infrastructure to house potentially 20,000 people do we want that to be on a military installation do we want to do that in communities across the country those are all policy decisions but what is lost still in what happened is that the United States government over a period of the last few months split up families and they're going to be children that grow up in the United States never knowing their parents again because of a decision by the president United States and it's irreversible I mean I guess what I don't understand about the Republican run Congress is I've asked this before I'm done doing it they've lost their souls that's evidence here but why don't they want to help clean up the damage and and as this may be irreparable damage to children done at the hands of the people running our government Donald Trump Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell have potentially ruined the lives of 2,300 children guess why because they may not have a way to undo it it might be too late this is something that's never been done before which means there's not a way to undo what has already been done they may be searching desperately for a way to undo it but they're quite literally is not a way the other thing I would just like people to think about is those cages those detention centers you know the reason we're reckoning with them is because there were little babies in them but America has been putting migrants in those cages on those mattresses with those mylar blankets for years and if you were shocked by the fact that children were in them I was shocked to see it myself you should be shocked by the fact that we put human beings and they're not just in this administration but in previous administrations Democrat and Republican police I have absolutely no confidence that our government is capable of reuniting these 2,300 children with their parents you look at what happened with Puerto Rico and the horrific response there and now we're supposed to defy that the government government is confident enough to reunite these finally 2,300 kids in this in 13 states this that we know of no worse political crisis that if you were just scripting what could be the most horrific scenario that I could dream up it may be that's part of the problem we've had a failure of imagination with the Trump administration how incompetent and how depraved they can be with their public policy your newspaper in every section covered this story yesterday the business section of the stories about Microsoft and Hollywood's and figures in Hollywood wanting to walk away from working with the federal government and working with Fox News who defended this policy you guys have covered every angle of this story where where do you think the solutions will comfortable they come from the private sector who says we weren't able to stop this but we're gonna stop doing business with the federal and Microsoft so that some employees at Microsoft took a stand I mean this seems to require as Elise just said more imagination to to sort of help engineer some solution for reuniting these children with their families look we have seen some airlines refused to you know put these kids on their flights the private sector in some ways has been a real counter-attack on the president in in the past few months I do think in a country as rich as we are and as powerful as we are and innovative surely we can do a better version of this than splitting them up from their families I mean there's got to be a technology solution and whatsmore enraging I think for a lot of people is this decision they made was was in the making for some time they had enough time to let out contracts right to find some beds for the first wave of kids did it occur to anybody in that administration what solution for for putting the kids back together hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on
