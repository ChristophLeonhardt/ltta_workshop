SURROUNDINGS THAT PROMISE TO BE A BIT MORE WELCOMING. SHANNON? Shannon: TRACE GALLAGHER, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE JUNGLE PRIMARY IN CALIFORNIA MEANS BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES ARE SCRAMBLING. THE TOP TWO VOTE GETTERS REGARDLESS OF PARTD WILL ADVANCE TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. THE STATE DEMOCRATIC LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND MY NEXT GUEST IS A REPUBLICAN. NEW ANALYSIS FROM THE NEW ANALYSIS FROM TH NEW ANALYSIS FROM "T NEW ANALYSIS FROM "THE SACRAMENTO BEE" SAID THERE ARE MORE REGISTERED INDEPENDENTS THAN REPUBLICANS IN THE STATE. TO BREAK IT DOWN WITH THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR JOHN COX. GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN. GREAT TO BE WITH YOU AGAIN, SHANNON. Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT THESE NUMBERS. MORE THAN 250,000 FOLKS HAVE ABANDONED BOTH THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN PARTY. THERE'S A BOOST TO INDEPENDENT VOTERS. IT NOW MEANS REPUBLICANS ARE A THIRD PARTY? THAT'S A MISNOMER. NOW WE HAVE THIS JUNGLE PRIMARY, NOT A CLOSED PRIMARY. SO YOUR PARTY REGISTRATION REALLY DOESN'T MEAN AS MUCH. I THINK THE ISSUE, SHANNON, IS HOW ARE PEOPLE FEELING ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR STATE. AND I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW, THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE, I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE INDEPENDENT, I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, THEY'RE UPSET ABOUT HOW THE STATE IS BEING MANAGED. I TALKED TO REVEREND GRAHAM THIS AFTERNOON AS A MATTER OF FACT, AND HE'S OUT TRYING TO GET CIVILITY BACK IN POLITICS, TRYING TO GET CORRUPTION OUT OF POLITICS. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE HAVE THE WORST AFFORDABILITY, THE WORST QUALITY OF LIFE. THEY JUST CAN'T MAKE IT HERE ANYMORE. AND A LARGE PART OF THAT IS THE MISMANAGEMENT OF THIS DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY IN SACRAMENTO THAT IS REALLY GIVING THIS STATE AWAY TO THE SPECIAL INTERESTS. AND THAT'S GOING TO END WHEN I'M ELECTED GOVERNOR IN NOVEMBER. Shannon: SO FIRST YOU'VE GOT TO GET THROUGH THE PRIMARY, THE JUNGLE PRIMARY WE TALKED ABOUT. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH PARTY, THAT THE TOP TWO PEOPLE IN THE POLLING IN THE PRIMARIES COULD BE TWO DEMOCRATS, TWO REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENT, WHATEVER. HERE'S WHAT HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI HAD TO SAY ABOUT HOW IT WORKS. THIS IS TERRIBLE. IT COSTS MORE MONEY. IT SHUTS OUT SMALLER PARTIES. SO I DON'T RECOMMEND IT. Shannon: SHE IS AGAINST IT. NOW WE'RE SEEING A NUMBER OF RACES THERE IN CALIFORNIA IN WHICH DEMOCRATS ARE EITHER BEING FORCED OUT, SO THEY DON'T GET EITHER ONE OF THE SPOTS, OR REPUBLICANS ARE SHOWING UP LIKE YOU IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS? WELL, IT WAS A DEAL HATCHED ACTUALLY BY A DEAL BETWEEN A KIND OF A VERY LIBERAL REPUBLICAN AND ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, AND HER FELLOW DEMOCRATS IN SACRAMENTO. THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD BE WORKING OUT REALLY WELL WITH THIS SYSTEM. IT'S NOT WORKED OUT FOR THEM. IT'S KIND OF HILARIOUS AND RICH TO HEAR NANCY PELOSI SAY THAT. I WOULD SUGGEST NANCY PELOSI GO TO TALK TO SOME OF THOSE LIBERAL BILLIONAIRES LIKE MICHAEL BLOOMBERG AND HASTINGS, BECAUSE THEY'RE MAKING HASH OF THIS. THEY'RE SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS GAMING THIS, RUNNING ADS ATTACKING ME TRYING TO BRING DOWN MY VOTE SO LIBERALS CAN GET IN THE TOP TWO. THEY HAVE TWO DEMOCRATS. YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY'RE SHOCKED BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING. THERE'S A BACKLASH TO IT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE JUST SMART ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT THAT THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO GAME THIS THING. I'M FAIRLY CONFIDENT I'M GOING TO BE IN THE TOP TWO. THEN WE'LL HAVE A REAL DEBATE WITH GAVIN NEWSOM. HE WANTS TO RAISE TAXES, HE WANTS TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE SPENDING ON THE BIG GOVERNMENT. I WANT TO GET THIS STATE TO BE AFFORDABLE, OPEN FOR BUSINESS, REDUCE THE TAX BURDEN, GET RID OF THIS AWFUL GAS TAX. AND MAKE IT SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SURVIVE IN THIS STATE. Shannon: WE ONLY HAVE A FEW SECONDS LEFT BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE TO ASK YOU ABOUT IMMIGRATION. IT'S INTERESTING THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA, REGARDLESS OF PARTY, AREN'T REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE SANCTUARY CITY POLICIES THE STATE HAS ENACTED, YET THEY KEEP ELECTING PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE WHO ARE ENACTING THOSE POLICIES. SO WHERE IS THE DISCONNECT ON THAT ISSUE? WELL, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIG ALTERNATIVE IN NOVEMBER, BECAUSE I'M OPPOSED TO THE SANCTUARY STATE. YOU KNOW, THE REASON PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT, SHANNON, IS THEY KNOW WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT IF OUR LOCAL SHERIFF HAS AN MS-13 MEMBER IN THEIR LOCKUP, THEY CAN'T LET I.C.E. KNOW ABOUT IT, IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. I DON'T WANT TO LIVE NEXT TO AN MS-13 MEMBER, NOBODY DOES. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DEPORTING CRIMINAL, ILLEGAL ALIENS, THAT OUGHT NOT TO BE CONTROVERSIAL. AND THAT'S WHY GAVIN NEWSOM'S SANCTUARY STATE POLICY IS GOING TOENED IN NOVEMBER WHEN I'M ELECTED GOVERNOR. Shannon: WE'LL HAVE LIVE
