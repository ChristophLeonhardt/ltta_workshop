♪ ♪ Jesse: INSPECTOR GENERAL MICHAEL HOROWITZ FACING OFF WITH LAWMAKERS AGAIN TODAY OVER OVER HIS REPORT ON THE CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION. PRESSING HOROWITZ OVER REVELATIONS OF FBI VIA SPIRITS BECAUSE THEY. JUDGE THE OUTCOME OF THE HILLARY CLINTON INVESTIGATION BEFORE THE INVESTIGATION ENDED IN THESE EXACT FBI AGENTS AND ATTORNEYS PREJUDGE THE OUTCOME OF THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION BEFORE IT EVEN BEGAN. DO YOU BELIEVE THIS TEXT SHOWS POLITICAL BIAS? I THINK AS WE HAVE FOUND, IT CLEARLY SHOWS A BIASED STATE OF MIND. PETER STRZOK SAID TRUMP IS ABYSMAL, HE'S AN IDIOT. HILLARY SHOULD WIN 100 MILLION TO 0. SOUNDS LIKE HE HATES THE PRESIDENT. HIS TEXT MESSAGES WOULD LEAVE THAT IS THE IMPLICATION. Jesse: HOROWITZ CONFIRMING TO CONGRESS HE IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER PETER STRZOK, ANTI-TRUMP BIAS FACTORED INTO THE LAUNCH OF THE BUREAU'S RUSSIA PROBE. STRZOK'S LAWYER IS FIRING BACK SAYING HIS CLIENT IS NOT A CONSPIRATORIAL BUT INSTEAD, READY? A PATRIOT. KIMBERLY, WE ARE GETTING WORD FROM STRZOK'S LAWYER. APPARENTLY HE HAS BEEN ESCORTED OUT OF THE FBI OFFICE BUILDING. Kimberly: I HOPE AFTER LISTENING TO TREY GOWDY TODAY THAT HE SPEED DIALED THE BEST WASHINGTON, D.C., DEFENSE LAWYER AND I MEAN THAT SERIOUSLY. YOU LISTEN TO TREY GOWDY EARLIER TODAY, IT WAS QUITE COMPELLING AND PERSUASIVE. HE WAS INSISTENT AND FIRED UP ABOUT THE WHOLE THING. I WAS LISTENING TO HIM. WOW. HE'S MADE THE CASE AGAINST NOT ONLY STRZOK BUT COMEY AND McCABE AND PAGE. IT'S BAD, REALLY BAD FOR THE UNITED STATES. BAD FOR THE FBI, THIS IS SYSTEM OF JUSTICE. TREY GOWDY MADE THE POINT THAT THERE CAN BE NO FAIRNESS IN THE PROCESS WITH THIS LEVEL OF INHERENT BIAS. Jesse: VERY BIASED. WE WERE LEARNING THEIR MORE FBI AGENT SENDING ANTI-TRUMP TEXTS. MAYBE ONE OR TWO OF THOSE LAWYERS WOUND UP IN THE MUELLER TEAM. DANA. THIS MUELLER TEAM IS PACKED FULL OF THESE PEOPLE AT THIS POINT AND THEY WERE REMOVED FOR ANTI-TRUMP BIAS. BY MUELLER. THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AGO. Dana: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? I DIDN'T FOLLOW THAT PARTICULAR PIECE BECAUSE I WAS FOLLOWING IMMIGRATION ALL DAY. I DID NOTE FOR TODAY CATHERINE HERRIDGE SAID PETER STRZOK COULD WILLINGLY TESTIFY IN FRONT OF CONGRESS AT THE END OF THE WEEK. I WILL PAY ATTENTION TO THAT, I PROMISE. Jesse: GREG, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE IG HEARING? Greg: I BELIEVE STRZOK'S TEXTS ARE MORE INCRIMINATING IN TERMS OF CONSPIRACIES THAT ANYTHING IN THE RUSH OF COLLUSION THINK THAT I WAS TRYING TO THINK ABOUT THIS. WHAT WOULD BE COMPARABLE TO WRITING "STOP TRUMP," WOULD BE TRUMP TEXTING: CALL PUTIN. WE'VE GOT TO STOP HITLER. THAT WOULD BE THE SMOKING GUN. THE BIG STORY TO ME AS ALWAYS WHEN TO BE TREY GOWDY'S EVER-CHANGING HAIR. HE IS LIKE MARTIN LANDAU IN MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. HE'S GOT TO GO SOMEWHERE. HE IS A RUSSIAN AGENT. Dana: SAY CIA OR SOMETHING. Greg: I THINK HE WORKS FOR THE RUSSIANS. Donna: NATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY. I THINK THE BEARD IS VERY BECOMING. POLITICS SOMETIMES IS NOT SO BECOMING. I ACTUALLY DID WATCH. IT'S BETTER THAN WATCHING SOAP OPERAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. THE REASON WHY I WATCHED IT IS BECAUSE UNDERNEATH ALL THE PARTISAN RHETORIC ABOUT THAT, WE LEARNED THAT ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE AN AGENCY THAT HAS SOME DYSFUNCTION. WHETHER YOU FOCUS ON THOSE EMAILS, TEXTS, DISGUSTING. I'M A FORMER FEDERAL EMPLOYEE. DISGUSTING. LET'S SAY. IT'S DISGUSTING. WHETHER YOU'RE SAYING THOSE THINGS ABOUT MR. TRUMP OR SAYING THOSE THINGS ABOUT MRS. CLINTON. THEY ARE NOT HIRED TO TEXT EACH OTHER ABOUT THEIR PERSONAL DISLIKE OF A PARTICULAR CANDIDATE. THAT BEING SAID, THE OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY MUST NOW DO THEIR JOB AND REMOVE THOSE WHO ARE STILL IN THE EMPLOY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BEYOND THAT, I THINK THIS REPORT TELLS US A LOT ABOUT MR. COMEY STATE OF MIND, THE FACT THAT HE WAS INSUBORDINATE. HE BELIEVED HE ALONE COULD DELIVER THE SO-CALLED MESSAGE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. DIDN'T HAVE TO CHECK WITH HIS BOSS. THERE IS A LOT TO LEARN IN THIS. I HAVEN'T READ ALL OF IT BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE NO PICTURES. I READ FASTER WHEN I SEE PICTURES. BUT IT IS A STORY THAT WE NEED TO KNOW. BY THE WAY, YOU AND I CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE RUSSIANS. I CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT OF THE LANGUAGE NOW BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT HAPPENED. Greg: I AM MARRIED TO A RUSSIAN SO I CAN SPEAK A LITTLE. Jesse: SPEAKING OF COMEY, THE INSPECTOR GENERAL CONFIRMS COMEY'S HANDLING OF THE CLASSIFIED MEMOS IS UNDER INVESTIGATION. EVERYONE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION. Greg: WE WILL BE SOON. Donna: CAN WE DO ANOTHER KUMBAYA AT THE END OF THE SEGMENT? Greg: THESE THINGS ARE LIKE SOCCER. IT IS LIKE 0-0 AT HALFTIME. IT'S LIKE SOCCER. 0-0 AT HALFTIME. Jesse: I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS A TIE. I THINK IT WAS A SLAM DUNK. Greg: THE NEXT ONE WILL BE... Donna: YOU WAIT UNTIL 1:38 AND THE GUY SCORES, YOU'RE LIKE THANK YOU.
