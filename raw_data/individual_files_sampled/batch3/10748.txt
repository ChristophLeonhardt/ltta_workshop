a Dutch shipping group is facing accusations of selling a number of vessels with harmful waste to scrap yards in Turkey and India adding to environmental and health problems there but ultimately violating EU laws the case is playing out in Dutch courts the prosecution is alleging the ships sold to be broken apart in India and Turkey contained a number of toxic substances which should have been removed and recycled earlier in a safe manner it also cites the alleged impact of the chemicals on recycling workers and the environment in those countries a hefty fine over breach of EU waste laws is being sought if convicted shipping bosses could face up to six months in prison now if it's part the company has rejected any wrongdoing the defense for the C trade group argues the ship's only qualify as waste once they reach their final destination and don't fall under EU environmental rules as Turkey and India are beyond this jurisdiction a lack of proper regulation in the industry is one of the problems highlighted by their ship breaking NGO platform the trade is a Dutch company and certainly in 2012 the conditions at the yards in South Asia were well known to any European company so the choice C trade made was for the highest price and these yards offer higher prices because they do not pay for the proper waste management the proper infrastructure and they use migrant workers that are not trained it indeed unfortunately is a very common practice more than 80 percent of the world tonnage is currently broken on three tidal beaches in the world when in India when in Bangladesh and when in Pakistan this activity causes pollution to the sea the air the groundwater and is also very dangerous for the workers they fall from Heights there are explosions they will be crushed by steel plates so it's basically an industry which is very poorly regulated
