INDESPICABLE.
WHO SENT THEM IS THE NEXT
QUESTION.
WE HAVE TEAM FOX COVERAGE
BEGINNING WITH CATHERINE
HERRIDGE LIVE IN WASHINGTON.
CATHERINE?
>> IN THE LAST HOUR, LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TOLD FOX
NEWS THAT THE DEVICES WERE SENT
BY A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL OR SINGLE
GROUP, THIS IS BASED ON
FORENSICS AS WELL AS THE FACT
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
MULTIPLE DEVICES OVER 72 HOURS.
WHAT IS KEY, THERE'S A NUMBER OF
VERY STRIKING SIMILARITIES WITH
THE PACKAGING OF THE DEVICES.
SO THAT SAME SORT OF EXCESSIVE
POSTAGE, THAT SORT OF EXCESSIVE
YELLOW PACKAGING, THE CRUDE
ADDRESS ON THE PACKAGE SENT TO
CNN THERE.
ALSO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE
ADDRESS IS SOMEWHAT SHIFTED TO
ONE SIDE.
THEY'RE ALL TELLTALE SIGNS OF A
SUSPICIOUS DEVICE AND SHOULDN'T
BE OPENED.
I'M ALSO TOLD THAT THE GEORGE
SOROS PACKAGE IS SIMILAR IN
PACKAGING AND DESCRIPTIONS.
SO IT'S BEING CONSIDERED IN THIS
SAME GROUP AS BY THE WORKING
THEORY, AN INDIVIDUAL OR A
SINGLE GROUP, SHEP.
>> Shepard: WHAT HAVE
AUTHORITIES SAID STANDS OUT
ABOUT THESE, IF ANYTHING?
>> WELL, I SPOKE WITH THE SOURCE
THAT DEALS DIRECTLY WITH THE
EXPLOSIVE PART OF THIS
INVESTIGATION.
THEY SAID TO ME THAT IT'S REALLY
PRETTY UNUSUAL TO SEE PIPE BOMBS
SENT IN ENVELOPES.
THAT'S NOT STANDARD.
THERE'S NO OBVIOUS WAY TO HAVE
THE INITIATION FORWARD THE
DEVICE.
THEY THOUGHT THIS WAS DESIGNED
TO SEND A MESSAGE AND TERRORIZE
PEOPLE.
TYPICALLY THEY SAID THEY SEE
THESE INITIATIONS WITH THESE
MUSICAL BREATHING CARDS.
THEY COME THROUGH THE MAIL, YOU
OPEN IT UP AND THAT'S THE
TRIGGER FOR THE DETONATOR.
THEY DREW MY ATTENTION FOR THE
POSTAGE.
THEY SAID ALL OF THE PACKAGES
USED THE MULTIPLE AMERICAN FLAGS
TO DO THE POSTAGE.
THEY DID NOT USE ANY OF THOSE
OTHER FOREVER STAMPS THAT MANY
OF US USE WHEN WE SEND THINGS BY
SNAIL MAIL.
THAT'S WHAT STOOD OUT TO THEM
FROM AN INVESTIGATE
FROM AN INVESTIGATIVE POINT OF
VIEW.
>> Shepard: AND YOU LEARNED MORE
ABOUT THIS PACKAGE THAT WENT TO
FLORIDA.
>> YES.
ONE SUSPECT PACKAGE WENT TO
FLORIDA, NOT TWO.
I WAS TOLD BY A FEDERAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL THAT THE
PACKAGE WAS SENT TO ERIC HOLDER
AND IT WAS NOT DELIVERED TO THE
ADDRESS.
IT WAS THEN SENT TO THE RETURNED
A DRESS, WHICH WAS DEBBIE
