Daphne Khurana galicia is death shocked a nation to many she was a fearless anti-corruption crusader but she was also accused of scathing even defamatory journalism and of being politically partisan on her widely read blog a year after she was killed in a car bombing the reasons for her death are still unclear the family wants a public inquiry free from all political interference the focus of that inquiry unlike the current processes is to look into whether Daphne's life could have been saved so that would mean looking into possible state failure to protect and possible state complicity in the assassination this is where Daphne Khurana Galicia was killed she left her home in a village just up the hill in a leased car the blast was so powerful it scattered parts the vehicle in surrounding fields some of her remains were found 80 meters away from here this isn't the first car bomb in Malta there have been six since the start of 2016 but it's the first time the victim hasn't been a criminal three men are on trial for her murder questions surrounding a motive a yet to be answered kawana Galicia claimed to have uncovered corruption at the highest levels in a Maltese Bank the police and the government she believed officials were granting residency and passports in return for bribes from shady individuals trying to access the European Union she also linked Maltese politicians including the prime minister Joseph Muscat with offshore tax havens he denies the allegations but quranic Alicia's family believed there's been a deliberate attempt to control the narrative surrounding her death to make it look like she was investigating criminal gangs alone and not the government the prime minister declined our request for an interview since Carolina Kelly Shias death colleagues say Malta's media path of which is owed directly by political parties has lacked an important voice there was nothing like her before and there's been nothing since her bravery I imagine will inspire others in the years to come locally she opened many people's eyes to what journalism could be this is what's left of a once large makeshift memorial to the journalist opposite Malta's law courts it's tended to by activists who say it's regularly torn down even in death they say she continues to be silenced Nev Barker al-jazeera Valletta Malta
