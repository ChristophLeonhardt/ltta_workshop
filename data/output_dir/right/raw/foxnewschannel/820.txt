1
00:00:00,956 --> 00:00:01,289
IN 1960.

2
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:05,160
THERE IS NO COST TO THEM.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,162
THE COST IS ENTIRELY ON YOU, BUT

4
00:00:07,162 --> 00:00:09,931
DON'T COMPLAIN OR ELSE THEY CALL

5
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:10,365
YOU HITLER.

6
00:00:10,365 --> 00:00:11,566
WE WANTED A CLOSER LOOK AT THE

7
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:16,605
FACTS THE ON THE STORIES THAT WE

8
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:18,106
SPOKE TO THE ACTING ICE

9
00:00:18,106 --> 00:00:19,141
DIRECTOR.

10
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:21,343
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

11
00:00:21,343 --> 00:00:23,311
YOU'VE HEARD PROMINENT PEOPLE

12
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:26,181
COMPARE YOUR BEHAVIOR TO THAT OF

13
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:33,955
THE, , HOW DO YOU RESPOND?

14
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:36,925
>> THEY ARE SIMPLY ENFORCING

15
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:37,959
LAWS ENACTED BY CONGRESS.

16
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:40,962
I WAS THERE WAS THIS MUCH

17
00:00:40,962 --> 00:00:42,164
OUTRAGE ABOUT SEPARATION OF

18
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:42,731
FAMILIES.

19
00:00:42,731 --> 00:00:44,399
I WISH WE MET WITH MOTHERS AND

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,768
FATHERS WHOSE CHILDREN WERE

21
00:00:46,768 --> 00:00:48,136
KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

22
00:00:48,136 --> 00:00:49,171
JEWISH CITIZEN CHILDREN THAT

23
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:51,573
WERE KILLED AND SEPARATED FROM

24
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:52,841
THEIR FAMILY FOREVER.

25
00:00:52,841 --> 00:00:54,943
I THINK PEOPLE ON THE HILL NEED

26
00:00:54,943 --> 00:00:57,779
TO STRAIGHTEN THEMSELVES OUT.

27
00:00:57,779 --> 00:00:58,580
LET'S PROTECT AMERICAN CITIZENS

28
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,318
AS MUCH AS YOU ARE LOBBYING FOR

29
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:04,953
THE LEGAL ALIEN.

30
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:10,225
>> WE ARE ABOUT TO TALK TO ONE

31
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:15,096
OF THOSE PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN

32
00:01:15,096 --> 00:01:15,864
WERE KILLED.

33
00:01:15,864 --> 00:01:18,767
>> THE IMMEDIATE LAST FEW DAYS I

34
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:22,304
HAVE BEEN INCENSED BY THE

35
00:01:22,437 --> 00:01:24,339
AMERICAN PEOPLE BY POLITICIANS.

36
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:25,373
THEY SAY THE TRUMP

37
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:27,175
ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO USE

38
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:30,212
THESE CHILDREN AS POLITICAL

39
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:30,512
PONS.

40
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:31,980
THEY ARE HAVING A SIDESHOW FOR

41
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,982
THESE CHILDREN TALKING ABOUT THE

42
00:01:33,982 --> 00:01:35,717
ISSUE.

43
00:01:35,717 --> 00:01:36,418
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANTS

44
00:01:36,418 --> 00:01:39,487
CONGRESS TO FIX IT AND NO ONE IS

45
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:40,755
TALKING ABOUT THE UNDERLYING

46
00:01:40,755 --> 00:01:44,326
REASON FOR THE WHOLE ARGUMENT.

47
00:01:44,326 --> 00:01:46,461
ARE THESE FAMILIES ESCAPING FEAR

48
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:49,331
AND PERSECUTION?

49
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:52,434
OVER 80% OF THESE CLAIMS ARE

50
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:56,705
FRIVOLOUS.

51
00:01:56,705 --> 00:01:58,540
THESE PARENTS THEMSELVES ARE

52
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,342
USING THEIR CHILDREN AS PAWNS,

53
00:02:00,342 --> 00:02:02,644
AND AS FAR AS SEPARATION OF

54
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:04,246
FAMILIES ARE CONCERNED, YOU HAVE

55
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:06,081
TO PUT THE BLAME ON THE PARENTS.

56
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:07,482
THEY ARE CHOOSING TO ENTER

57
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:08,350
BETWEEN THE PORTS OF ENTRY AND

58
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,185
THEY KNOW THEY WILL BE SEPARATED

59
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:11,051
BUT THEY WANT TO BLAME THE

60
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:13,321
GOVERNMENT WHEN WE ARE FORCED TO

61
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:13,655
DO THAT.

62
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:20,495
SO LET'S PUT THE BLAME ON WHO

63
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:20,829
ADVISED.

64
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:21,963
>> Tucker: WHILE YOU DON'T

65
00:02:21,963 --> 00:02:23,131
MAKE THE POLICIES OF COURSE.

66
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:24,532
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE DO WHAT

67
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:28,169
WE ARE HEARING WE MUST DO, WHICH

68
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:30,572
IS GIVING IMMEDIATELY AUTOMATIC

69
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:32,841
AMNESTY WITH ANYONE CROSSING

70
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:34,276
ILLEGALLY WITH A MINOR CHILD IN

71
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:34,542
TOW?

72
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:35,877
>> THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN DONE.

73
00:02:35,877 --> 00:02:37,178
LET ME TELL YOU THE WAY IT WORKS

74
00:02:37,178 --> 00:02:38,546
RIGHT NOW.

75
00:02:38,546 --> 00:02:41,549
UNDER THE AGREEMENT, IF A FAMILY

76
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:43,118
COMES IN OUR CUSTODY, WE CAN

77
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:45,553
HOLD THEM FOR LESS THAN 20 DAYS

78
00:02:45,553 --> 00:02:46,154
AND RELEASE THEM.

79
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:49,357
MOST OF THEM END UP IN

80
00:02:49,357 --> 00:02:51,660
IMMIGRATION COURT.

81
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,129
IMMIGRATION COURT ORDERED 40,000

82
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:55,664
AND SO WE WANT TO HAVE CONGRESS

83
00:02:55,664 --> 00:03:02,971
TO CHANGE THE LAW SO WE CAN KEEP

84
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:06,641
THESE PEOPLE DETAINED AND,

85
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,843
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THE FINAL

86
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:09,744
DECISION DOESN'T MEAN WE FORGET

87
00:03:09,744 --> 00:03:10,111
ABOUT IT.

88
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:12,447
LAST YEAR WHEN WE WENT AND

89
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:14,449
LOOKED FOR THESE FAMILIES, I GOT

90
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:16,551
HUNDREDS OF LETTERS SAYING, HOW

91
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:18,053
DARE YOU PUT YOUR FINITE

92
00:03:18,053 --> 00:03:20,322
RESOURCES FOR WOMEN AND

93
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:20,689
CHILDREN.

94
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:24,559
I SAID, WAIT A MINUTE, BECAUSE

95
00:03:24,559 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU DON'T LIKE THE DECISION,
