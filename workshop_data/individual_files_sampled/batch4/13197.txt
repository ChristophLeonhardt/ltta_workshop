you know I always like to have opposing points of view on the shows so that you get to hear from people who disagree with me you know for instance I come on here day after day and I talk to you and I say there's there's a god and you'll find joy if you live in the spirit rather than the flesh so to offer a different perspective I brought on a special guest ah Satan thank you for coming on thank you so much for having me old friend you know I'd really like to get your take on some of the events of the day for instance there's been this big you know uprising of women opposed to Donald Trump we recently had this women's March what do you think about that oh it's a delightful event thousands of women wearing pink hats to represent the fact that they had their vaginas where their brains are supposed to be bogus signs vulgar language angry hate filled speeches these are my source of ladies true also it drew attention away from that pro-life march down the street they were praying and celebrating their children huh and on the other side of that question of course you mean you're not pro-life you're pro-choice I'm not pro-life I'm anti life sin and death oh boy nothing I enjoy more than spending a pleasant afternoon watching babies being poisoned in the womb and then ripped to pieces so that their parts can be sold for a tidy profit some people enjoy the theater oh boy but for me it's Planned Parenthood all the way that's oh my mind picky of course whether it's gender reassignment for children or Islamic genital mutilation for little girls I feel that anytime a helpless youngster is mutilated to the service of the misguided philosophy of some adult well that's a good day oh boy sort of reminds me of the things did not see torturer doctors used to get up to know the Nazis you you missed the Nazis miss them I have them over for gin rummy every Thursday night it's their inhale with me forever of course I think we should have thought of that so all in all with all the abortion and mutilation mutilating children and vulgar women running around things are going pretty well for you right now well it's my planet old chap you're just living in it is there anything happening on earth you don't like no the government's must be getting a bit smaller I suppose that worries me some but Trump can't live forever like the old adage says a man can't live on fried chicken alone so I just have one more one more question is it you have such a an erudite kind of upper-class accent simple my boy it takes a tremendous amount of intelligence and sophistication to convince oneself and others that evil is good and good is evil and that's pretty much been my business since day one ah day eight depending on how you read the text all right well I got it thanks thanks very much for coming coming on you know actually I asked our producer Rob to get Santa to come back but he's dyslexic trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show speaking of satan we've got michael knowles coming on to cover the olympics he's gonna be with us in just a moment to talk about the media's absolute delight and love over North Korea just unbelievable stuff and I'll tell you in a moment why I made him do it with my why I made him watch the Olympics instead of me but first you know a couple weeks ago we got a new sponsor a peloton and I always like to try things out before I recommend them obviously I don't want to sell you something that's no good so I actually drove down to Century City which is about I don't know half an hour away from my house and I drove down there and went and visited the peloton shop and I took a look at the bike they have and what they what peloton is is it's a an exercise bike that you have in your home but it comes with a screen and when you buy the bike you also buy a subscription so you're getting classes in your home you don't have to drive to the gym you get a spin classes live or you can watch

go to one peloton dot-com and use the code Clavin and you can get started it is a remarkable machine and the classes are cool and they just come right into your home anyway the reason I made Knowles cover the Olympics I don't watch the Olympics I cannot stand them I find them excruciating and one of the reasons there are many reasons but one of the reasons is that so many of the events are not sports to me a sport is an objective event it is it has points somehow you somehow score points or runs or whatever they call them and whoever has more of those at the end wins so you know right you hit the ball out of the park you get a home run that is a point it's a run if you score run across the goal into the you know run across the line into the goal across the goal line you get six points that's a touchdown their points whoever gets the most points win or if it's golf whoever gets the less points whatever it is there's not some guy just telling you what it is obviously there are referees referees make mistakes and they're human and that's part of the game you have a conversation but in so many of these things like figure skating and the ski jumps and you know freestyle ski jumping it's just the judges giving points and for me the difference between sport and that is the exact same difference between capitalism and socialism in capitalism you compete you compete directly you try to make something better you're right and freedom I mean in general you have to have ideas here's my idea people should be free women should have equal rights here's your idea women should wear burqas and not get to drive you know let's see which one of those ideas in the in the competent in the field of competition let's see which idea wins I invent a phone that looks like this and has this you invent one that has this and has this which phone is better it's all you know competition but what socialism is and what the global elites want is they want a world in which they sit and you you have an idea and they just hold up a sign yes we'll give that idea 9.9 no no that idea takes my power and money away that's just a five point six and of course once you have that system once it's all based on the judges once winning it loses all based on the judges the judges will become corrupt they may not become corrupt in the first generation but they will definitely become corrupt in the second generation so every time I watch this the the Olympics I just think like it that's not sports iam some guy holding up a sign it's not like it's not like I can't watch you know fun skiing and stuff like that but it's not it's not the competition just show me and I'll just say that was that was amazing so a lot of the news as far as I'm concerned has been about the way that the media you know Kim jong-un's sister was there and uh it was embarrassing and Noel's will talk about this but they just praised Kim Jong and sister and the Korean this dance - synchronized dance team they had I just you know um so they're sitting there this is one of the most corrupt murderous oppressive regimes I mean these are the guys they murdered the you know kim jongmin had his brother-in-law i think it was murdered half brother murdered in an airport they put that cloth over his mouth and they get you know it's just like hideous stuff but people are being sent overseas as slave labor north koreans are being sent overseas as slave labor they're being thrown in prison they're disappearing you know do we have that picture of of North Korean South Korea from the sky there it is you can just see South Korea with freedom it's all lit up you can see it North Korea you see a little dot that's the capital otherwise it's black and they're starving people are starving they're crawling out of there any way they can and they're and so the press is praising them and so you could just say well it's Trump derangement system syndrome you know try says black they say white he says up they say down he says freedom they say North Korea hey nuts there but the fact is the fact is the press has been using the Olympics to praise tyranny for a long long time our friends are one of my favorite websites MRC's News Buster's put together a series of coverage from the Olympics you know since going back to the 90s and I have the guys here splice it into a montage this is the kind of coverage you've been getting from the Olympics and why it's so hard for me to stomach it try not to laugh when someone says these are the world's greatest athletes despite a paucity of blacks that makes the Winter Games look like a GOP convention the Revolution that birthed one of modern history's pivotal experiments in Korea Cuba Vietnam and space knew us at times it seemed like a national obsession Stalin promised the Metro would be a palace for the people and so it is open architecture mosaics and chandeliers from designer clothes to new cars China is getting rich democracies once bragged that theirs was the only way to economic success China is doing it the Communist way it's fascinating though to see how generous the maternity benefits are in this country and it men can sort of switch roles with their wives and get that 42 weeks paid leave yeah Paula you and I have been talking about we want to send our kid we want to want to move here and put our kids in school here the kids are treated so well I think we have a lot to learn from these folks I think you're right we want to express our nationalism as a part of the world's community and I expect to see that but we have to also be careful and draw a line not to let our patriotism get in the way of the games in general obviously the opening ceremony the the games themselves will be very patriotic and feel and yet sometimes the international community can interpret that as arrogant nationalism obviously you've got a balance those two things we don't want bit too much patriotism from the Americans but we're gonna celebrate Stalin's subway that's Stalin he makes a great you know yeah yeah he's killed my wife and children but but he makes a great subway you know in China getting rich the communist way I mean this is something they've been doing for a long time back in 1936 kim jong un's philosophical predecessor a guy named adolf hitler who you may have heard of he had the Olympics in Germany here is the New York Herald Tribune covering that this is their international edition in a riot of color and music and ceremonial splendor that could not be dimmed by letting skies and occasional showers the 16 day period of the Berlin Olympic Games celebrating the 11th Olympiad of modern times was inaugurated today under the patronage of Chancellor Adolf Hitler leader of the German people with royalty and nobility and diplomats and commoners and athletes of fifty nations participating in a germanized festival that overshadowed the sports pageant itself homage to Hitler all through the ceremony stood out boldly against the setting of the Olympic opening ritual Hitler's arrival signaled by a trumpet solo from the huge towers that formed the marathon gateway to the stadium was taken up by a hundred piece symphony orchestra while which burst into Deutschland uber alles as the entire crown crowd sang the refrains it was mild applause when the American team appeared through the marathon gate but nothing to compare with the ovations to Bulgaria France and later Austria as the Americans were marching past Hitler the German array appeared on their heels and the Americans were promptly and completely ignored now I'm not saying that they were supporting Hitler there I'm just saying this is like you know an emptiness of thought that it does promote the idea that if we're unpopular we're wrong it's entirely possible that we can get the fewest cheers and still be in the right and speaking of the man who gets the fewest cheers Michel Knowles is with us he died for stim to watch the Olympics because I just can't bear them I mean how how were they in general well I'd like to first thank you for introducing me as the man who got the fewest years instead of Satan you spare a strange resemblance I don't know I don't know why you remind me of thing it was really awful thank you again this this rivaled Southside with you and berry rivaled both of them it was I almost wanted to watch them though because of the media coverage yeah when we sat down a sweet little ELISA you know my fiance said Mac can we not watch any Olympics this year I'd love to do that but Drew's going to make me do it that's right yeah the CNN Headline quote Kim jong-un's sister is stealing the show under Olympics I mean this is just the first paragraph yeah if diplomatic dance where an event at the Winter Olympics Kim jong-un's younger sister would be favored to win gold wholly with a smile a handshake and a warm message in South Korea's presidential guestbook by the way there was no warm message but that's beside the point kim yo-jong has struck a chord with the public just one day into the Pyeongchang games now this has been rightly pilloried obviously it should be pilloried max Rosen told The Washington Post which where democracy dies in darkness yeah he tweeted out all of these stories about how her visit played in South Korea or about how her visit played in South Korea among South Koreans the pile on about these pieces is frankly tedious and this is this reminds me of like all of Walter Durante's stories were about how Stalin played to an idiot New York Times reporter and you know the moral idiocy is press a little tedious - there's this this oh come on get off it stop being so American about all of this and and you know I always am listening for when news people tell me a the American people feel this when they start to use phrases like some people are saying yeah I thought like yet like your boss yeah that's right they'll say what you know speak in the passive voice questions are being raised and you think like by you basic the critics say my name is critic my name is critic they all they also were attacking I mean Mike Pence and the Kim jong-un sister were sitting together basically watching some of those they were sitting together and Mike Pence didn't acknowledge her because she's a murderous dictator Asst oh you you picky I know I'm so f know centric American centric or something here are some you guys you're right this is the big difference in coverage between our milquetoast vice president and this murderous monster in North Korea the annual GDP is $1,800 per capita that ranks 197th in the world and those are just the official statistics yeah 125,000 North Koreans are held in concentration camps and tortured 12 million people in North Korea are starving they live in extreme poverty where they can't get enough food to survive the average life expectancy has fallen five years since just the 80s now down to 69 according to the official statistics that this is likely a decade higher than the reality of it but even the Korean government can't pretend that these people live any longer than 69 years workers are in 2 to 3 dollars per month even figuring in some black market things it basically cannot rise to more than $10 $3 a month yeah that's a but that will buy you a pomegranate like that's right oh you're one of the little seeds of the pomegranate the that that number by the way even including black market is a third of the government salary in Cuba that's a level for comparison yeah homes receive a few hours elektra of electricity a day if they have electricity most do not most do not have plumbing parents who send their kids to school need to provide desks chairs building materials and cash to pay for fuel the trouble is school isn't school it's a labor camp so most parents actually save all that money and bribe the teacher not to make their children go to school so they don't have to be enslaved by the government north korea has free universal health care except patients must pay for their own drugs the cost of heath and prepare all of their meals at home Kim jong-un meanwhile is worth five billion dollars an estimated five billion dollars so that guy how nice isn't this so nice the mainstream media were calling kim yo-jong the the korean Ivanka Trump you know I'm gonna interrupt you to do a commercial so that you just vanish into thin air but I will be right back I want to continue this conversation talking about the dollarshaveclub.com which I have been a member of since way before they were they were sponsors and as you can see some of us have to do a little more shaving than others and I really think a lot about my razors and in fact in fact this week when I was traveling that was like which of my should my razors should I take it on I really have gotten into like a complete obsessive idea about this in Dollar Shave Club just genuinely helps basically you subscribe they send you the razors every month they send your new blades every month so you're not constantly using those blades that you get from disposable razors and you don't know when to throw them away you don't have to go to the store and open up and set off the alarm and then get carried off and arrested put in prison for years and so you kindly come back to the big beard and then you don't even know how to shave anymore instead they just send them directly to you and you can put in your box you know your cyber box you can put in shampoo body wash toothpaste all the other things that they have and they have this kind of shave butter which I like because you can see through it as clear and and and you can choose which kind of razors you want I use both the executive and the basic two blade one because sometimes I don't have to shave as much as other times but when I use that executive thing I get an incredible shape all of the blades give you good shapes you can join Dollar Shave Club today for just five dollars with Free Shipping and they'll send you their starter set it has the six blade executive razor so it's only six I keep saying is 152 blades but it's it's six blades executive razor plus trial sizes of shave butter body cleanser and one wipe Charlies then keep the blades coming for a few bucks more a month get yours a dollar shave club comm slash Clavin that's dollarshaveclub.com slash Clavin and you want you probably want me to turn around so you because I've got the word Clavin carved into the back of my head but I'll just spell it for his KL a VA n go to dollarshaveclub.com slash Clavin and start I get started with these five dollars I love these blades so they're really good let's go back to this for a minute Noel's you're talking about you're talking about the incredibly crummy economy they have but but there's also not to not to kick a dead horse beat a dead horse but there's also the oppression you know they have I was reading who is Amnesty International which is not exactly you know a right wing what you know site they said that the citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea can you to suffer violations of most aspects of their human rights North Koreans and foreign nationals are arbitrarily detained and sentenced after unfair trials for criminal offenses that were not internationally recognized severe restrictions on the right to freedom of expression continued thousands of North Koreans were sent by the authorities to work abroad basically as slaves the government continued to dispatch through state-owned enterprise at least 50,000 people at least up to 120,000 people remained in detention centers which you know as we know from our own guy warmbier are basically killing fields I mean this is a guy they're praised and then they're there they're there people come on and dance and they said how great it was hundreds of thousands of North Koreans are tortured daily in concentration camps to say nothing of the millions and millions who were enslaved the entire country is enslaved and and this guy this regime tortured to death an American college student now I want to show you two clips okay this is how CNN treated Kim jong-un's sister meantime with the world watching the Olympics she will put a young telegenic face on the regime this is a calculated move from kim jeong-hoon experts say to answer Ivanka Trump's presence at the closing ceremonies kim yo-jong is the perfect counterpart to this and it also is a signal that North Korea is not you know this crazy weird former cold war state but that it too has young women that are capable and are the future leadership yeah young woman and the rest are slaves just like Trump's America right it's just like yeah so that's how CNN treats Kim jong-un sisterly boo how does CNN treat our milquetoast vice president Mike Pence now let's talk about why Rippon doesn't want to meet with the vice president he's openly gays an advocate as well he referenced either gay conversion that goes back to about 2000 when the Vice President was a congressman and he was supporting funding for services for people who want to change their sexual behavior orientation what else could that mean but gay conversion therapy Chris that's a and words are important I know you feel this way I first do as well that it certainly sounds like a conversion therapy but I asked the press secretary if she could give me the answer of what that was and that was back on January 17th an hour back and forth it goes on for about ten more minutes it just keeps going obviously lievable it's like yeah and you know as we all know in Indiana you know gays after running live in the woods because of this was a major pillar of Mike Pence's 2000 congressional campaign is electrodes for gays to he was running he went you know he wanted to increase the net disposable income of Hoosiers he wanted to reform regulations and he wanted to electrocute I remember actually do sell this line I mean we have to tell people that you're joking yes because the press actually does sell this line well what's to the truth what did he actually do yeah this is totally made up so on one of Mike Pence's congressional campaign websites at some point they said that he supported a bill to fund treatment for HIV and a man that's been pretty bad that monster and in there it included a provision that some funds would be directed toward institutions that if we're if people wanted to change their sexual behavior they could get some therapy to change your sexual behavior now let me tell you something as a red-blooded American man there are plenty of aspects of my sexual behavior that probably one should change so that's where they get this from they so let's let's let's say let's take them at their word and that means gay conversion therapy or whatever it means I mean of some sort so that's one sight that that was put up in conjunction with a bill of the fight AIDS this is this is classic political hacker II by the way and I I can tell you this because I've done it myself fun campaigns yeah what you do is you hire these Oppo people to scour your opponent's website and they find any little three words that they can rip out of context and turn into a television ad and that's what happened here so they found one line from one provision from a paragraph about supporting a bill to fund aids medicine and AIDS research and they pulled that out and that was supposed to be the big scare quote and look I don't mind that they did that that's what politics is but for journalists and to pretend that this is reality this is a big problem but of course that isn't the case it's one line you could do it with any candidate over any bill the trouble with voting you know the trouble with being a congressman is you have to vote for bills and every bill has some line in it that can be taken out of context so you always have a terrible record and they they could do this with anybody they they're doing it with Mike Pence and what it really shows is that the mainstream media are not journalists because political activists would use that line journalists would not miss it you see it is a huge problem did you happen to see by the way the Korean dance team or something like this that the only watched the gymnastics but I'm sorry yes the I did see the Korean dance team they tweeted out New York Times tweeted this all of the mainstream media these like little catchy phrases about how amazing it was how look at this but what it really brought back to me was a memory of the death of Kim Jong Il did you you know if people weren't ecstatic enough or excited enough they'd be thrown in the gulag or they'd be killed you know do you know that in 2006 21 members of a North Korean cheering squad that had traveled to South Korea for an international athletic event they came back and started talking about what they had seen in South Korea so they sent up to prison you can bet you can bet that dance team was working really hard to get it right yeah you saw it you know when Kim jong-il died that you saw people were sobbing so much and we this is what we saw on camera and I thought you know if that camera were on me in North Korea I'd be I'd be doing the best performance of my life I'd be tears have been coming out of everywhere so so you're gonna talk about this more in your show right I'm gonna talk about a different take on this because it seems we've just said that the these journalists are not journalists they're political activist yes what I want to talk about is the moment that the MSM began to hate the USA this was not always the case there was a time in this country where the mainstream media did not always try to subvert their own country especially on foreign affairs and we're gonna explain why that changed spoiler alert it's Walter Cronkite thanks a lot no is a really good report I'm glad you had to watch it not me sad for me you know you know why the you may ask yourself why the left loves these regimes these communist regimes that slaughter me you know I mean Stalin killed tens of millions of his murdered tens of millions of his own people and they're sitting there talking about his beautiful subway system you know it's like yes and it's made with the bones of murder yeah what are they talking about that the reason is is that if you do not trust the people and you think that you are so much smarter than the people then ultimately you've got to start saying to yourself hey we've got to stop the people from doing what they do you know what are the people do something some people have prejudices some people have ideas that you don't like some people are not so nice so you don't want to trust them you want to tell them what to do and it works good it's always gonna work great as long as as long as you erase the people who get in your way I mean everything works fine as long as you erase the people but they just kind of forget about that and they want to sit the left wants to sit in the stands like the Olympic judges and tell us how good our ideas are how good our products are which thing materials we can use which things we can say how we should build our buildings all this stuff and it's no wonder they hate Donald Trump cuz he keeps tearing apart the methods and systems by which they do that all right we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube you can continue to listen on YouTube or come over to the daily wire.com and listen to the rest of the show but but if you

you don't want to miss it it's Wednesday February 14th at 5 p.m. Eastern 2 p.m. Pacific come on over and join the conversation all right we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube you know the thing that Knowles was talking about is really important about how much the press has ceased to be pro-american and assisted in it and instead is probably pro socialist Pro global you know all the things that really and by the way as I keep saying we already live in a global world that's not the question the question is whether they're going to be countries in the global world that can compete and that have different ideas and different ways of living because if you take those away who protects you from King George Soros or Emperor George Soros or whoever it is who protects you if you don't have a country with certain laws that protect you you know you can't count if those laws disappear from George Soros Empire then who will protect the Americans and keep the Americans in free you know I mean if you've got at the top you've got a bunch of tyrants like at the UN saying you know what we need we need some blasphemy laws who stops that if there are no countries where they say yeah well in our country we don't have blasphemy laws you can say anything you want and I'm always but I'm always struck by the fact that the press changes everything so for instance for instance you know that you remember this Republican memo that basically basically proved we basically now know that the FBI misused some Democrat Hillary Clinton opposition research called the steel dossier to get a warrant to spy on an American that was probably used this part we don't know yet but that warrant was probably used to spy on the Donald Trump campaign so we had the corrupt Obama administration using the instruments of power to spy on the opposition party which is complete third-world tin-pot dictator crap okay that is like the bad stuff we're always trying and if the Republican had done it if George W Bush had done it if Trump did it the press would be going insane so the Republicans put out a memo about this while the Democrats and the press but I repeat myself did everything they could to suppress it so the Democrats put out their counter memo which according to The Wall Street Journal doesn't really say much except that we feel we can trust Christopher's steel that his Oppo research was actually good that's what their but they say that anyway and Trump on Friday said we're not releasing it because it's filled with information that the FBI and the Justice Department don't want us to release or go ahead and redact it and then we'll release it and so the Democrats use this they obviously did it on purpose but they used it as a way of saying oh well you'll put out the Republican memo but you won't put out the Democrat memo here is Adam Joe McCarthy Schiff talking about the hypocrisy is cut number six the hypocrisy of this just kind of reaches out and grabs you by the throat here the Republicans write a memo which the FBI quite accurately describes as misleading and omitting material facts the Department of Justice says it would be extraordinarily reckless to release this and what does the president do he says I'm gonna release it before I even read it hundred-percent I'm going to release it this is a president who puts his own personal interest above the national security interests of the country now they claimed when they released the Republican memo that this was in the interest of full transparency and all the way house people were saying full transparency well apparently full transparency only goes so far so the thing about this is is the Republicans are saying and I'm sure this is true the Republicans are saying that the Democrats purposely put in stuff that couldn't be released so the Trump would have to send it to be redacted and then they could say what hypocrisy just like Schiff was saying so oh my gosh they released one memo but not this mammal olive olive oh that is a good clean dirty trick that is a good clean political dirty trick I heard that I thought pretty smart you know pretty smart if the press were honest and the press were fair and they said oh you know Democrats pulled off a good clean dirty trick I would be fine with it but the press simply echo everything this weasel is saying you know and I think that that suddenly turns this good clean dirty trick into a real dirty trick because there's no one to expose it except for us you know there's no one to say hey you know okay fair enough it's politics a taint beanball you know you go out and you'd pull a dirty trick but there's no one to say it because the press covers it up and it changes everything the same thing is true with this Rob Porter scandal you know I wrote a piece about this and I said some of this on the air last week too about how the Rob Porter scandal is a scandal this is the guy who was it's alleged by two of his ex-wives that he beat them and the White House said John Kelly said this guy was a mine he was a staff secretary and and John Kelly said you know we support him we like him we know him he didn't do this he says it's not true and then there came out a picture of one of his ex-wives with a black eye and they basically said you're out they threw him out so that's a scan that is a real scandal people were leaving comments on my essay saying no that's not a scandal that's his personal life when when you beat your wife that's an act of villainy right that's a criminal act of villainy it's like you know it's like saying oh well yeah but he Rob's banks off you know off duty he he's a serial killer off duty you can't really fire him for that no no when a guy when working with the guy he turns out to be a villain you throw him out so that was the right thing to do it is true it is true that life is very complex and a guy who beats his wife can come into work and be a completely plausible good guy you know he can come in and say oh you know you would say well I can't believe it you know and he would come to you and say I didn't do it there said this my ex-wives are angry at me and all this and you would believe him you know life is very complicated people are very multifaceted but once you have a real feel like it's not like a trial you you don't have to have a bi doesn't have to be beyond a reasonable but doubt but once you begin to think and you know this guy was beating his wife he's out of there he's gone it's scandal it's a scandal it's a it's a to on the scandal meter and this scandal about the Obama administration's spy on the Republicans through the instruments of power that is a huge scandal so I would have nothing wrong with them reporting on the scandal but they just it's just the way they do it they keep trying to basically suggest first of all they won't stop covering it George Stephanopoulos on his Sunday broom covered this for something like thirty five minutes this minor minor thing and of course the purpose of this is to connect Donald Trump and to make sure that women stay upset about Donald Trump cause there's stuff about Donald Trump that upsets women he's kind of macho he's obviously played around maybe he was even you know harassing women who knows what he was doing but something about him really gets you know goes up woman's spine sometimes that stuff he said on the hollywood access tape all of that stuff and they just want to make sure that women continue to be upset so they don't notice that their lives are actually improving you know the economy is improving there are plenty of powerful women in the administration more women are going back into the workplace more women are in the workplace things are going well for women in this country under Donald Trump but they don't like him and then that's all the Democrats have and they want to sell you that here is Matthew Dowd on this George Stephanopoulos Rob Porter marathon you know talking about why Rob Porter is somehow somehow condemns Donald Trump this is not a staff problem this is not a management problem that's like saying Pablo Escobar has a staff problem because drug smugglers and drug dealers work for him Donald Trump could not pass a FBI background check or get a security clearance if he worked as staff at the White House based on all his actions based on 12 credible women that have accused him of sexual harassment based upon his first wife who in her first divorce proceedings said she was raped by him then recanted it based upon a guy that defrauded thousands of people and I'm a university situation this is a guy as president United States who allows who enables this so why wouldn't the jet general counsel why wouldn't the chief of staff basically safe it doesn't matter we have this guy as president so this is what they're this is what they're after they're after John Kelly John Kelly his company's cleaned up the White House the thing that may you know a lot of as you've noticed and as we've talked about a lot of the things that the left tries to do to Donald Trump end up blowing up in their own face and one of the reasons this may blow up on their own faces one of the women the ex-wives says she told the FBI about the abuse that she was suffering while they were doing interviews about it to get him clearance right because the FBI comes around if you get an appointment the White House the FBI does an investigation into you to make sure that they can they can clear you for security and this is one of the things that you can't get cleared on so my question is is did the FBI tell John Kelly and if not why not and secondly who leaked this to the press I think was the Daily Mail that first ran with this who leaked it if the FBI leaked that then it really does seem to me that the FBI is still operating to hide the malfeasance they committed while Donald Trump was running for president and so this could become part of the scandal because just like this whole Russia scandal is now it now really seems that the only people who colluded with the Russians are the Democrats who got all this information from Christopher Steele who got it from the Russians the only people who were colluding with the Russians were the Democrats it route it may turn out to be that the FBI is the reason that they didn't know about this I can't say that for sure but all I do know is it's a scandal Donald Trump should call John Kelly into his office and say general I rebuke thee you know John Kelly should say mr. president I stand rebuked and everybody should get back to work and you know we can talk about it but the way it's always the press that turns these things because they're working so hard for one side the side of the elites the side of the corporations the side of globalism the side of the Democrats because they're working so hard for one side is they take these stories and they make fools of themselves and they make you feel like I'll forget it already just drop it and they distort and ruin everything all right it is time for our crappy culture so I know when I think about our crappy culture I immediately think about Ben Shapiro no I'm kidding it's just that Ben wrote a piece that I just I thought it was a terrific piece on our site the headline if you want to look it up because it may have fallen off the front page the headline was female rabbi publishes the single stupidest piece on Biblical Adam and Eve ever written it's not close and I read then I thought Oh Ben you know he's always he's always calling Eva stupid and everything's a stupid is this not I went on and read this piece which first of all is hilarious is really well-written its Shapiro at his Shapiro issed and it really is it really is excellent but I thought oh no wait Ben was being like his Saint Francis like he's been too kind to this piece and this and then I went and read the actual piece to make sure he was eating because I couldn't believe anything this stupid had been published so the rabbi his name is Tamara Colton obviously female rabbi and a psychologist in Birmingham Michigan and she writes this piece about the Genesis story and she starts out as a 47 year old woman rabbi which is the first thing by the way the left is always identifying themselves first you know as a black woman you think like that doesn't make you right you know even if you're talking about being a black woman you may be wrong you know so it's like just tell me what you have to say she's as a 47 year old woman rabbi I've become emboldened by these brave young women of the me2 movement to speak a truth that I've known in my heart for a long time but have been hesitant to share the time the time has come for me to step this is not Ben's imitation this is the actual piece the time it's the time has come for me to step forward to it's time we all acknowledge an overwhelmingly powerful source of shame and silence in the Bible the story that begins the Bible the first one that we learn in Sunday school the founding story of man and woman upheld for thousands of years by judeo-christian religion is actually the story of the first sexual of a-salt a sexual assault of a woman the woman's name is Eve and the perpetrator is God I want you to have I want you to think about this says she here is a young beautiful intelligent naked woman in a state of grace she's hungry so how's the most natural thing in the world and she eats a piece of fruit for following her instincts trusting herself and nourishing her body she's punished her punishment she will never again feel safe in her nakedness she will never again love her body she will never again know her body as a place of sacred sovereignty this thing goes on and on and it is I mean I'm sure I don't have to tell you that in the Bible both Adam and Eve or forbidden the fruit of one tree in a lush vibrant garden filled with fruit right there one tree the tree of the knowledge of good and evil they are forbidden and she eats it and that's why they are punished and he eats a do we gives it to him and he eats it too and that's why the but this is sexual assault it's all about God and you know I the thing the reason I call this out for our crappy cultures this is something that is happening in the churches across America the Episcopal Church and I am a member of the Episcopal Church and sometimes sorry to say but the Episcopal Church and the Diocese of Washington DC and I was just in Washington and every Episcopal Church you go by has some black lives matter thing or some gay rainbow flag or something like this they the Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Washington DC passed a resolution last week to stop using masculine pronouns for God in future updates to its Book of Common Prayer so Jesus called god father it's the he's the father there's the son but they're not gonna use these they're not gonna use masculine pronouns my problem with it it's like if you don't want to believe God is male I mean I believe that God goes beyond male and female I mean it says he created man in His image male and female so I believe that God but but we know that our relationship to him is our relationship to him as the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit that's what we know from the Bible from the religion my problem with this is not that people want to believe this it's that they want to hijack other people's religions to teach it okay now listen there are things that I have problems with in my own faith journey with the church for instance you've heard me say that I'm very accepting of other people's sexuality I don't care if people who gave worked with gays my whole life people have respected loved you know liked who were my friends and who did tremendously creative work you know I'm uncomfortable with churches that come down really hard on homosexuality is a sin but I've never said you know I don't know whether it's a sin because I don't do it you know I just don't do it but I certainly know that there are all kinds of sins like gluttony you know like drinking like the lust and greed things that I persons that I participate in and I don't see why if even if being gay zhesan I don't see why the gay guy next to me should be thrown out or condemned but not the fat guy on the other side of me or me who has a lot of lust in my heart yeah I don't see why like all those sins aren't put together and we're all here together as sinful creatures you know but but I would rather go to a church and and by the way I think that there are arguments you can use with the Gospels to show that homosexuality is is not necessarily a sin per se that's another issue but I would rather go to a church that was true to its understanding of the Gospels then a church that said well the Gospels say this the religion say this but if your sentence begins with Jesus says there shouldn't be a but in the next we go to the next phrase you have gone astray the religion is not yours the religion is the people's and it's God's you know so I mean you can make lots of different arguments there are lots of lot of people object to the way I read the Bible I get this all the time you know we disagree about the way to read the Bible but at least I'm reading the Bible at least the words mean to me what they mean and if I have an argument that seems to contradict what's in the Bible I have to make that argument from the Bible and from logic and from reason I don't just get up and declare that I don't like this anymore and I just think that is such a poisonous dishonest thing to do if you don't believe be leaving you know hopefully you've go let people worship but don't ruin your temple or your church with by letting your opinions and your feelings supersede the Gospels you know again again there are lots of different ways to read the Bible there really are that are completely honest and completely in keeping with what's in the books there that's why there are so many different sects and so many ways to disagree by honest Christians but this is dishonest in the fact that it's dishonest it has no bearing in the in the sacred found they knew of the religion if you don't like the religion just leave don't destroy it all right what do we got tomorrow who's on tomorrow rum Oh Hannah sure like for campus reform you know these guys
