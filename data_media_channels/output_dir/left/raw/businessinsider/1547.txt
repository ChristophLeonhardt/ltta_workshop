when Bernie Sanders was running he had a

much more aggressive tax plan that

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:04,380
Hillary Clinton did and when you add

together the income and payroll taxes he

was proposing and state and<font color="#CCCCCC"> local taxes</font>

this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> only for the very wealthiest</font>

look these people already have so much

it's a what what the heck it's it's

and an taxation of giant fortunes he

piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> American political rhetoric</font>

34

because to preserve a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Democratic Society</font>

35
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,979
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to ensure that great fortunes</font>

36
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,799
don't dominate the economy so it's an

it's so you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say it's a good thing</font>

41
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,670
when very wealthy people earn less money

42
