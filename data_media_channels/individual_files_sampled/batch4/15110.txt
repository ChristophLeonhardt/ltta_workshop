but my friend Sheila Gunn Reid has aligned she says don't threaten me with something that I want and and like if these countries are saying haha Donald Trump will never do that well maybe he actually wants the excuse to cut foreign aid that maybe he didn't have yesterday like maybe if Donald Trump had wanted to cut foreign aid by one two three four billion dollars yesterday a lot of people would have squawked but maybe all these tough guys saying we'll call Donald Trump's bluff maybe they just gave him a gift cuz now he says I'm standing up for America I'm standing up for nikki Haley I'm standing up for Israel I'm cutting 4 billion from all these America haters and I think a lot of Americans would say you go whereas they wouldn't have before so maybe all these guys playing a game of chicken with Trump maybe he just got them to threaten him with something he wanted it's gonna be very and what he does go ahead sorry yeah that may well be the case because one of the biggest lobbies for continuing u.s. aid is the enormous bureaucracy that gives out that aid in other words Washington along with the rest of the swamp it has a lot of people who make a living by deciding how to give American tax dollars to places like the United Nations aid programs and so forth and they are that's actually one of the groups you don't see directly in this kind of confrontation but they well of course they want the money to keep flowing out it's not their money they're sending our tax dollars to somebody else they get paid well for doing that and what these countries now saying you know we don't care what you do we're going to vote against you have done you're exactly right is give President Trump something where he can say much more clearly to that bureaucracy as well as to these other countries know there are reasons not to do that that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Yazoo Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch The Daily Show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
