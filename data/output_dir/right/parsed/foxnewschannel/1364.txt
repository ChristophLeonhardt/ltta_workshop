NORTH KOREA.
>> Shannon: DID RAISE EYEBROWS
ON ALL SIDES OF THIS
CONVERSATION.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S DIRECTOR OF
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE JAMES
CLAPPER OFFERING RARE PRAISE FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S UNUSUAL
DIPLOMATIC APPROACH TO HIS
NORTH KOREAN COUNTERPART.
>> THIS IS TYPICAL NORTH KOREAN.
ONE STEP BACK, -- TWO STEPS
FORWARD, ONE STEP BACK, THAT'S
WHAT THEY ALWAYS DO.
IN SOME WAYS HE MAY HAVE MET HIS
MATCH OR WITH A VERY
UNCONVENTIONAL PRESIDENT.
>> Shannon: LET'S BRING IN
CLIFF MAY FOR ANALYSIS,
PRESIDENT OF THE FOUNDATION FOR
DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US
TONIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF FORMER DNI
CLAPPERS STATEMENT THAT HE MAY
HAVE MET HIS MATCH.
>> COMING FROM JAMES CLAPPER
THAT'S QUITE A COMPLIMENT FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
HE OBVIOUSLY DOES DIPLOMACY
UNCONVENTIONALLY AND I THINK
WHAT CLAPPER IS SAYING IS MAYBE
THIS IS GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT
THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD IN THE
ADMINISTRATION FOR THE
DEMONSTRATION BEFORE THAT OR THE
ADMINISTRATION BEFORE THAT
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN GOING BACK
AND FORTH NOT SUCCEEDING WITH
NORTH KOREA FOR ABOUT A QUARTER
OF A CENTURY.
>> Shannon: SO THERE ARE A
NUMBER OF COUNTRIES THAT ARE
CRITICAL TO US GETTING THIS
DONE.
WE SAW THAT THE TALKING WITH
PRIME MINISTER ABE, BUT WHEN IT
COMES TO CHINA, RUSSIA AND MANY
OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT
ESSENTIALLY ENFORCING THE
SANCTIONS IN FULL, WHAT PARTNERS
DO WE NEED TO GET ON BOARD IN
ORDER TO ACTUALLY MAKE SOMETHING
HAPPEN?
>> THE HARDEST PARTNER AND THE
MOST CONSEQUENTIAL IS OF COURSE
CHINA.
CHINA HAS SEEN NORTH KOREA AS AN
ASSET.
IT'S A PITBULL.
IT BARKS A LOT, IT BITES AT
AMERICA'S LAKES.
IT KEEPS AMERICA DISTRACTED AND
IT REPRESENTS A THREAT TO
AMERICA AND CHINA IS SEEING THAT
IS A GOOD THING.
WHAT HAS TO CHANGE?
CHINA HAS TO SEE NORTH KOREA NOT
AS AN ASSET BUT RATHER AS A
LIABILITY.
THAT'S NOT EASY, BUT IT'S NOT
IMPOSSIBLE.
THAT'S GOING TO PROBABLY REQUIRE
PRESIDENT TRUMP PUTTING A LOT OF
ECONOMIC PRESSURE NOT JUST ON
NORTH KOREA, MUCH MORE THAN HE
HAS ALREADY, BUT ALSO ON CHINA
THAT WILL HURT CHINA, IT MAY
HURT THE U.S. AS WELL BUT UNLESS
HE SHOWS THAT HE IS WILLING TO
DO THAT AND A COUPLE OTHER
THINGS WE CAN TALK ABOUT, CHINA
IS NOT GOING TO SEE THIS AS ITS
PROBLEM TO SOLVE.
>> Shannon: I KNOW THAT
NORTH KOREA'S ECONOMY AMONG
OTHER THINGS IS VERY OPAQUE.
IT'S TOUGH FOR US TO GET A REAL
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE
AND THERE ARE SOME ACCOUNTS THAT
ARE READ TODAY THAT SET
FINANCIALLY THEY ARE NOT DOING
AS BAD AS PEOPLE WOULD THINK MAY
BE THAT THEY ARE.
THERE IS STILL CURRENCY FLOWING.
THEY HAVE GOTTEN WEAPONS THAT
ARE TRADING FOR AT MIDDLE EAST
THAT THE UNREST THERE ACTUALLY
BENEFITS THEM IN MANY WAYS.
>> THE STRATEGY OF THE PRESIDENT
HAS TALKED ABOUT WITH
NORTH KOREA -- BY THE WAY WITH
IRAN AS WELL, IT'S ONE OF
MAXIMUM PRESSURE.
MAXIMUM PRESSURE MEANS THAT THE
U.S. ECONOMY IS SO STRONG WE CAN
PUT SUCH PRESSURE ON, SANCTIONS
NOT AS SLEDGEHAMMERS AT THE SIDE
OF THE HEAD THAT WE CAN CRUSH A
FOREIGN ECONOMY LIKE
NORTH KOREA.
WE CAN MAKE IT CRUMBLE.
SO THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS, CAN
WE ACTUALLY DO THAT?
AND WILL BE ACTUALLY DO THAT,
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEFORE.
IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT AN
ANALOGY.
VERY TOUGH SANCTIONS ON IRAN
BEFORE THEY CAME TO THE
NEGOTIATING TABLE.
WE LIFTED THEM, PRESIDENT OBAMA
LIFTED THEM.
THE ECONOMY OF IRAN WENT FROM
SUBSTANTIAL RECESSION INTO
RECOVERY AND WE NEVER GOT
ANOTHER CONCESSION AFTER THAT.
ALREADY NORTH KOREA HAS HAD
ABOUT A TWO MONTH RESPITE FROM
SERIOUS SANCTIONS AND IS
PROBABLY GOING TO GET AS I
UNDERSTAND IT ANOTHER RESPITE
BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE 12TH.
I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS
TO PUT VERY TOUGH SANCTIONS ON
SO THAT KIM JONG UN LOOKS AROUND
AND SAYS MY ECONOMY COULD
ACTUALLY IMPLODE.
THAT WOULD BE DANGEROUS.
PLUS THE SKY TRUMP IS SO CRAZY
HE MIGHT EVEN USE MILITARY
MEANS.
I DON'T WANT A MISSILE ON MY
BREAKFAST TABLE.
>> Shannon: THAT IS VERY
