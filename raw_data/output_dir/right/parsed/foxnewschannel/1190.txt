IS BUILDING, SO THE PARTY WANTS
TO HANG TEN TOMORROW, TRYING TO
GET TOP CANDIDATES ON BALLOTS IN

WITHOUT A WIPEOUT.
ALL DEMOCRATS HAVE TO DO TO GET
ON A BALLOT IN THE JUNGLE

THEY MAY BE LEFT OFF NOVEMBER'S
BALLOTS.

THE TABLE, THE MORE SHE HAS TO

HAPPENING ESPECIALLY WHEN IT
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THERE IS A
BLUE WAVE.

CALIFORNIA.
THERE IS NO WAY.

>> ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS TRYING
TO AVOID BEING LOCKED OUT OF THE
