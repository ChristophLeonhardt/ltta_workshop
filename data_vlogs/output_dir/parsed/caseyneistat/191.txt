it's not as scary as you think I don't
know it doesn't feel like you're a
thousand feet in the air it's cool
though day two Helsinki I have another
speaking thing today I've got some press
to do today but I have a couple of hours
free and there's a few things that I
want to check out the first of which is
in this very hotel I was told this is
the coolest pool and all of Helsinki
I didn't bring a bathing suit so you
will have to excuse the censorship
dr. Koo look whoever prevented well
so this is my second day in Helsinki
it's also my last day in Helsinki and I
haven't actually gotten out and like
explored the city at all I have one free
hour right now and that's what that's
what that's what I'm trying to do
I don't want a donut I especially don't
want a bright pink donut but I had to
get this donut because look how perfect
looking it is it's like a cartoon donut
it's good I'm taking a break at this
like cafe style place that's by where
the gigantic ships take off they go to
Sweden I'm taking a break not because I
want to take a break but my boosted
board battery died so I'm just in here
charging it this place by the way in
addition to having amazing pink Donuts
also has jgermeister on tap something
for everyone I suppose
and this way go together yeah yeah
that's the coolest thing ever
that's the US Embassy right there
so the event that I'm going to speak at
right now the one seat yet today is a
different event entirely from yesterday
two events two different days put
back-to-back it's part of the reason why
I decided to make the long trip to
Helsinki is because the opportunity to
speak to different audiences on two
different days was just
really good timing it's so cold outside
right now it's like freezing outside
I'm not I'm not trying to make excuses
but this thick fog rolled in and I don't
know how to get around this town but I
could always see the tower of the hotel
where I'm staying and now I don't lost I
think it's over here somewhere
no no I was just a brick wall right
