>> 
>> SO I JUST WATCHED LAST NIGHT,
OUR GREAT VICE PRESIDENT MIKE 
PENCE, HE TRAVELED ALL THE WAY 
TO HAWAII, 12 HOURS, THAT WAS 
OKAY, WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED IF 
IT WAS 50 HOURS, TO MEET THE 
REMAINS AND GREAT FAMILIES OF 
THE AMERICAN HEROES WHO GAVE 
THEIR LIVES IN KOREA. 
>> 
>>  USA! 
>> OUR FALLEN WARRIORS ARE 
FINALLY COMING HOME TO LAY AT 
REST IN AMERICAN SOIL. 
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. 
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. 
WE ARE HONORED TO BE JOINED 
TONIGHT BY YOUR STATE'S 
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR 
GOVERNOR, A GREAT GUY, SOMEBODY 
I KNOW WELL, HE'S GOING TO BE 
ONE HELL OF A GOVERNOR. 
HE'S TOUGH, HE'S SMART, SCOTT 
WAGNER. 
SCOTT! 
AND I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE 
YOUR TERRIFIC REPUBLICAN 
CANDIDATES FOR CONGRESS. 
JOHN SHRIN, DAN MOOZER, JOHN 
JOYCE, AND A MAN THAT WAS THERE 
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, HE 
HEARD I WAS GOING TO BE RUNNING 
-- HE SAID, YOU GOT TO GO WITH 
TRUMP. 
A MAN NAMED TOM MARINO. 
AND HE WAS A GOOD FRIEND AND IS 
A GOOD FRIEND OF LOU. 
THEY LOVE EACH OTHER. 
TOM MARINO. 
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. 
I ALSO WANT TO THANK 
PENNSYLVANIA GOP CHAIRMAN VAL 
DIGIORGIO, AND DAVID, YOU DO 
SOME JOB ON TELEVISION, I WANT 
TO TELL YOU, DAVID, WE DID A 
GREAT JOB. 
YOU KNOW, PENNSYLVANIA, FOR 
YEARS AND YEARS THEY TALKED 
ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA WILL BE WON 
BY THE REPUBLICANS, RIGHT? 
IT ALWAYS GOT AWAY. 
NOBODY KNEW WHAT HAPPENED. 
IT ALWAYS GOT AWAY. 
BUT WE WON THE STATE OF 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
REMEMBER? 
REMEMBER? 
>> 
>> REMEMBER THAT INCREDIBLE 
NIGHT IN NOVEMBER? REMEMBER 
THAT INCREDIBLE NIGHT? 
AND YOU REMEMBER THAT WE WERE 
WAY UP IN PENNSYLVANIA. 
AND THERE WAS ONLY 2% OF THE 
VOTE LEFT. 
AND WE WERE WAY UP. 
IF I LOST EVERY VOTE, WE WOULD 
HAVE WON THE STATE OF 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
AND THE FAKE NEWS REFUSED TO 
CALL IT. 
RIGHT? 
THEY REFUSED TO CALL IT. 
WE WAITED FOR HOURS. 
WE WERE AT 98%. 
I SAID, WHAT'S GOING ON? 
I WANT TO WIN WITH THE STATE OF 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
AND THEN SOME INTERESTING 
THINGS HAPPENED. 
BEFORE THEY CALLED. 
THEY JUST REFUSED. 
THEY SAID, DONALD TRUMP HAS WON 
THE GREAT STATE OF WISCONSIN. 
RIGHT? 
THEY SAID, DONALD TRUMP HAS WON 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY 
YEARS, BOTH OF THEM. 
THE GREAT STATE OF MICHIGAN, 
AND YOU PEOPLE DIDN'T GET THE 
PRIVILEGE OF TAKING THIS OVER 
THE TOP. 
NEXT TIME. 
NEXT TIME. 
>> 
>> THEY WOULDN'T CALL IT! 
I KEPT SAYING, WHY AREN'T THEY 
CALLING PENNSYLVANIA? 
REMEMBER, AN HOUR, TWO HOURS, 
SO LONG, 98% AND THEY WOULDN'T 
CALL IT. 
WELL, THEY WERE SUFFERING THAT 
NIGHT. 
THAT WAS SUFFERING. 
I REMEMBER A NICE MAN, ACTUALLY 
LIKE HIM, HE'S VERY TALENTED, 
WITH A BIG CHART. 
AND ALL THAT RED IS STARTING -- 
I STARTED GETTING RED, THAT 
CHART, READ, READ, READ, LITTLE 
TINY DOT OF BLUE ALONG THE 
OCEAN. 
A LITTLE BLEW OVER HERE, AROUND 
THE LOS ANGELES AREA. 
THAT HOLE THING WAS RED -- HIS 
HANDS STARTED SHAKING -- A 
LITTLE BLUE OVER THERE.  
-- THAT WHOLE THING WAS RED. 
FAKE NEWS. 
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CALL THEM, 
RIGHT? 
SUPPRESSION POLLS, RIGHT? 
SUPPRESSION. 
THEY GIVE YOU PHONY POLLS, SO 
THAT YOU SAY, YOU KNOW, 
DARLING, WE HAVE AN ELECTION 
TONIGHT. 
BUT TRUMP WON'T WIN BECAUSE THE 
POLLS ARE SO BAD. 
BUT LET'S GO TO A MOVIE AND THEN
WE'LL COME HOME AND WATCH HIS 
DEFEAT. 
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM. 
NOBODY BELIEVED THEM AND 
EVERYBODY WENT OUT TO VOTE. 
RIGHT? 
EVERYBODY WENT OUT THERE. 
AND THEY TURNED ON THE 
TELEVISION, THEY SAID, DARLING, 
HE'S WINNING, LOOK, HE JUST WON 
FLORIDA, JUST WON NORTH 
CAROLINA. 
HE JUST WON SOUTH CAROLINA. 
THAT WAS SOME NIGHT. 
WAS THAT AN EXCITING NIGHT? 
EXCITING. 
ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST -- YOU 
KNOW, THEY KEPT SAYING THE 
STATE OF TEXAS, WHICH I 
THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, EVERY RALLY 
I WENT TO WAS LIKE THIS. 
AND BY THE WAY, YOU THINK THIS 
IS A BIG CROWD? 
GO OUTSIDE AND TAKE A LOOK. 
GO OUT --
>> 
>> BUT I WOULD GO TO TEXAS, AND 
I SAID, BOY, ARE WE POPULAR IN 
TEXAS. 
ALL RIGHT. 
GET HIM OUT. 
GET HIM OUT. 
GET HIM OUT OF HERE. 
>> 
>>  USA! 
USA! 
>> SO GETTING BACK TO TEXAS, SO 
FOR 2 1/2 MONTHS, I HEAR, TEXAS 
IS IN PLAY. 
THAT MEANS IT'S SO CLOSE. 
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ALL NIGHT 
LONG BEFORE WE FIND OUT WHO WINS
THE STATE OF TEXAS. 
AND I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT. 
AND THEY SAID, UTAH IS IN PLAY. 
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT. 
I'D GO TO GREAT UTAH, 
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE, AND THEN WE 
COME TO ELECTION NIGHT. 
I FIGURED IT'S GOING TO BE 
CLOSE IN TEXAS BECAUSE I 
BELIEVED THOSE PEOPLE. 
NO LONGER. 
BUT I BELIEVED THEM. 
SO IT HITS 8:00. 
AND THEY GO, LIKE, TWO SECONDS 
AFTER 8:00, DONALD TRUMP HAS 
WON THE STATE OF TEXAS. 
DONALD TRUMP HAS WON THE STATE 
OF UTAH. 
>> 
>> AND WE WON BY SO MUCH. 
AND I SAID TO MY PEOPLE, 
SOMEWHAT INNOCENTLY, WHAT WAS 
THAT ALL ABOUT? 
THEY SAID, SIR, IT'S 
SUPPRESSION. 
IF THEY CONVINCE PEOPLE THROUGH 
THE POLLS, PEOPLE DON'T GO OUT 
TO VOTE. I 
REALLY MEAN IT, OUR PEOPLE WENT 
OUT TO VOTE. 
NO BETTER INSTANCE THAN THE 
STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. 
NO BETTER. 
>> 
>> AND I WANT TO INTRODUCE A 
VERY SPECIAL MAN, BECAUSE HE'S 
BEEN A FRIEND OF MINE, FROM THE 
BEGINNING, HE'S BEEN WITH ME, HE
SAID YOU'RE GOING TO WIN. 
HE SAID YOU'RE GOING TO WIN, 
HIS GREAT POLITICAL PERSON, 
HE'S A LEADER, HE'S RUNNING 
AGAINST SOMEBODY WHO'S OVER -- 
SO OVERRATED, I MEAN, THIS GUY, 
I WAS TELLING A LITTLE STORY ON 
BOB CASEY. 
I'VE BEEN THERE. 
I'VE BEEN -- I HAVE TO DO THIS 
BEFORE WE INTRODUCE LOU -- SO 
I'VE BEEN IN WASHINGTON NOW FOR 
MORE THAN A YEAR AND A HALF. 
I HARDLY -- I MEAN, HONESTLY, 
I'M NOT SURE I EVER MET BOB 
CASEY. 
I NEVER MET HIM. 
AND I'M SURE I DID. 
I SHOOK HIS HAND, BUT I'M NOT 
SURE -- NOW, HIS FATHER WAS A 
GOOD MAN. 
KNEW HIM A LITTLE BIT. 
BUT WERE DEALING WITH A 
TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON. 
I DON'T THINK -- I DON'T KNOW 
THIS MAN. 
HE'S A SENATOR. 
I DON'T KNOW HIM. 
HE'S NOT AN OBSTRUCTIONIST. 
HE'S WORSE. 
HE WILL DO WHATEVER SCHUMER, 
PELOSI AND THE NEW STAR -- AND 
THE NEW STAR OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY TELLS HIM TO DO. 
YOU KNOW WHO THE NEW STAR, YOU 
KNOW WHO THAT NEW LEADER IS? 
MAXINE WATERS. 
>> 
>> VERY LOW IQ. 
LOW IQ. 
NO, MAXINE WATERS, IT'S LIKE, 
SHE'S LIKE THEIR NEW STAR. 
BUT I WANT TO INTRODUCE 
SOMEBODY THAT REALLY IS A STAR. 
HE'S SMART, HE'S STRONG, HE 
LOVES THIS STATE. 
PEOPLE ARE JUST STARTING TO 
KNOW HIM, BUT I'VE KNOWN HIM 
FOR A LONG TIME. 
AND YOU KNOW, WHEN HE WANTS 
SOMETHING FOR PENNSYLVANIA, 
HE'S BRUTAL. 
HE'S BRUTAL. 
SO IF YOU WOULD, LOU BARLETTA, 
PLEASE COME OUT. 
LOU BARLETTA. 
LOU BARLETTA. 
>> THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
THIS IS AMAZING. 
THIS IS JUST AMAZING. 
YOU KNOW, I NEVER, EVER THOUGHT 
IN MY LIFE THAT I WOULD EVER 
BECOME A POLITICIAN. I 
NEVER THOUGHT THAT I WOULD 
BECOME A MAYOR. 
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I WOULD 
BECOME A CONGRESSMAN. 
BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAMS 
DID I EVER BELIEVE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
WOULD COME TO MY HOME AREA TO 
HELP ME WIN AN ELECTION FOR THE 
UNITED STATES SENATE. 
>> 
>> THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
I'M GRATEFUL AND HUMBLED BY 
THAT. 
YOU KNOW, THE ECONOMY IS SOARING
UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
ECONOMY. 
IT IS SOARING. 
THE MARKET, THE MARKET IS UP 
OVER 20%. 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT 4%. 
BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT AN ALL-
TIME ON HIM -- HISPANIC 
UNEMPLOYMENT AT AN ALL-TIME 
LOW, WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT AT 
ALL-TIME LOW, SMALL BUSINESS 
CONFIDENCE IS AT AN ALL-TIME 
HIGH, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS AT 
AN ALL-TIME HIGH, MORE JOBS NOW 
THAN PEOPLE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED. 
ISIS IS PRACTICALLY GONE. 
NORTH KOREA IS AT THE TABLE. 
THE WALL IS BEING BUILT. 
WHY WOULD WE EVER STOP THAT? 
WE ARE NOT TIRED OF WINNING, 
MR. PRESIDENT. 
WE ARE NOT TIRED OF WINNING. 
BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU WHO WANTS
TO STOP THAT. 
BOB CASEY WANTS TO STOP THAT. 
HE HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST 
LIBERAL SENATORS IN WASHINGTON. 
HE IS LEADING THE RESISTANCE IN 
ABSTRACTION TO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S AGENDA. 
HE IS SO RADICAL, HE IS SO 
RADICAL NOW, THAT HE SAID NO TO 
NO MATTER WHO PRESIDENT TRUMP 
NOMINATED FOR THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
IT DIDN'T MATTER. 
HE SAID NO BEFORE HE EVEN 
MENTIONED TO IT WAS. 
HE GAVE US OBAMACARE. 
HE SUPPORTS SANCTUARY CITIES. 
HE WANTS TO TAKE AWAY YOUR TAX 
CUTS. 
HE NO LONGER REPRESENTS THE 
VALUES OF PEOPLE HERE IN 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
LISTEN, THIS SEAT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT. 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE 
WANT TO KEEP THAT ECONOMY 
GOING. 
WE WANT TO ONCE AGAIN SHOW OUR 
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRST 
RESPONDERS THE RESPECT THEY 
DESERVE. 
WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF OUR 
VETS. 
WE WANT TO HONOR OUR MILITARY. 
WE WANT TO SECURE OUR BORDERS. 
WE WANT TO PUT AN END TO ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION ONCE AND FOR ALL. 
AND WE WANT TO TAKE A KNEE TO 
PRAY INSTEAD OF -- AND STAND FOR
THE FLAG. 
>> 
>> NOW, I NEED EVERYBODY HERE, 
I NEED EVERYBODY HERE AND 
EVERYBODY WATCHING TO HELP. 
HELP ME HELP PRESIDENT TRUMP 
DRAIN THE SWAMP AND MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
THANK YOU! 
>> HE DID A GOOD JOB. 
SO LONG, FOLKS. 
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO? 
LOU, YOU DON'T KNOW LOU, SOME 
PEOPLE -- THEY DON'T KNOW HIM 
WELL. 
I'VE KNOWN HIM WELL FOR A LONG 
TIME. 
ALL I HAD TO DO, I WANTED HIM 
TO GET THIS POSITION TO RUN -- 
I SAID, ALL I HAVE TO DO IS 
INTRODUCE LOU BARLETTA TO THE 
PUBLIC A LITTLE BIT. 
BECAUSE HE'S KNOWN IN HIS AREA, 
HIS DISTRICT, HE'S LIKE A 
LEGEND. 
HE WAS A GREAT MAYOR, A GREAT 
CONGRESSMAN. 
BUT THE STATE DIDN'T KNOW HIM, 
REALLY, AS MUCH. 
AND TONIGHT, THEY ALL KNOW HIM. 
THIS GUY IS A DYNAMO, HE'S 
INCREDIBLE. 
AND I HAVE TO SAY, YOU'RE 
DEALING ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH 
THE EXACT OPPOSITE. 
LOU MENTIONED SOME OF THE 
THINGS, BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
JUSTICE GORSUCH, YOU DON'T DO 
BETTER THAN THAT. 
YOU DON'T DO BETTER THAN THAT. 
AND CASEY VOTED AGAINST HIM. 
AND NOW WE HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S 
EXTRAORDINARY. 
AS YOU KNOW, JUDGE KAVANAUGH --
>> 
>> YALE COLLEGE, YALE LAW 
SCHOOL, TOP, TOP STUDENT, TOP 
OF EVERYTHING, THEY PREDICTED 
15 YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS WITH A 
LOT OF OTHER TALENTED PEOPLE, 
SOMEDAY HE'D BE A SUPREME COURT 
JUDGE. 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 
I THINK CASEY DOESN'T EVEN WANT 
TO MEET WITH HIM. 
YOU KNOW? 
BECAUSE SCHUMER, PELOSI AND 
MAXINE WATERS TOLD HIM NOT TO 
MEET. 
SO HE WAS NOW AND PROBABLY WILL 
BE NOW, MAYBE AFTER TONIGHT 
HE'LL VOTE YES BUT I DOUBT IT. 
BECAUSE HIS BOSSES ARE TELLING 
HIM WHAT TO DO AND THEY ALWAYS 
HAVE. 
NOT THE FATHER, BUT THE SUN, 
YES. 
SO TO HAVE NO ON CABINET, NOW 
ON GORSUCH, NOW ON MASSIVE TAX 
CUTS, CASEY AND GROUP WANT TO 
END THE TAX CUTS
AND INCREASE YOUR TAXES. 
SOMEHOW THAT DOESN'T PLAY WELL. 
SOMEHOW. 
SOMEHOW THAT DOESN'T PLAY TOO 
WELL. 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE HE WAS 
NO ON? 
THE BIGGEST THING THAT ONLY 
REALLY THE BUSINESS PEOPLE IN 
HIS ROOM FULLY APPRECIATE -- HE 
WAS NO ON REGULATION CUTTING. 
WE HAD REGULATIONS THAT MADE IT 
IMPOSSIBLE TO DO BUSINESS IN 
THIS COUNTRY. 
HIGHWAYS WOULD TAKE 21 YEARS TO 
GET APPROVED. 
WE HAVE IT DOWN TO TWO YEARS AND
IT'S GOING TO BE ONE YEAR VERY 
SHORTLY. 
>> 
>> VERY SHORTLY. 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 
WE WANT CLEAN, BEAUTIFUL WATER. 
WE WANT CRYSTAL CLEAR ERROR. 
WE WANT OUR AIR -- CRYSTAL 
CLEAR AIR. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE 
TO GO THROUGH 97 DIFFERENT 
APPROVALS OVER A 20-YEAR 
PERIOD, AND WE MAY REJECT PLENTY
-- BUT WE ARE GOING TO REJECT 
THEM IN A YEAR AND CAN GO ON TO 
DO SOMETHING ELSE. 
WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE THEM 
DOWN THE LINE, 21 YEARS AND 
THAT YOU HAVE A 3-2 VOTE 
AGAINST THE PROJECT. 
WHERE PEOPLE WORK THEIR ENTIRE 
LIVES TO GET IT APPROVED. 
SO WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF MASSIVE 
AMOUNTS OF REGULATIONS. 
BOB CASEY -- BOB CASEY WAS 
JOINING PRESIDENT OBAMA -- 
>> 
>> AND HIS HORRIBLE ATTACKS ON 
OUR CLEAN COAL INDUSTRY -- BOB 
CASEY WAS MAKING IT ABSOLUTELY 
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MINERS AND 
LOU BARLETTA WAS FIGHTING ON 
BEHALF OF OUR MINERS, OUR 
COMPANIES AND OUR BEAUTIFUL 
PENNSYLVANIA CLEAN COAL. 
AND LOU WON. 
AND SO DID I. AND SO DID YOU. 
SO NOW WITH LOU ON OUR SIDE, 
WE'VE WON THAT WAR ON COAL, AND 
WE ARE DOING SOMETHING ELSE, 
BECAUSE WE'RE PUTTING THESE 
GREAT MINORS -- MINERS, GREAT 
MINDS, GREAT PEOPLE, I SAID TO 
THE MINERS, REMEMBER WHEN 
HILLARY SAID CLINTON SAID WE 
ARE GOING TO CLOSE YOU UP? 
RIGHT? 
THEN SHE HAD TO COME TO 
PENNSYLVANIA, --
>> NO, NO, NO. 
THEY ONLY WANT TO HURT 
REPUBLICANS. 
THEY DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING 
-- BUT IT'S ALL CHANGING, 
FOLKS. 
IT'S ALL CHANGING. 
SOME THINGS JUST TAKE A LITTLE 
BIT LONGER. 
THEY ONLY WANT TO GO AFTER 
REPUBLICANS. 
YOU LOOK AT THE KIND OF 
CRIMINAL ACTIONS AND CRIME, 
THEY ONLY WANT TO GO AFTER THE 
REPUBLICANS. 
BUT LOU WANTS TO PUT OUR MINERS 
BACK AND THEY ARE WORKING. 
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT I'M REALLY 
PROUD OF NOW, ABOUT FIVE MONTHS 
AGO, TOOK A WHILE TO GET ALL 
THE STATUTORY APPROVALS, WE'RE 
PUTTING OUR STEELWORKERS BACK 
TO WORK AT CLIPS THAT NOBODY 
WOULD BELIEVE. 
RIGHT? 
US STEEL IS OPENING UP SEVEN 
PLANTS, NUCOR IS OPENING UP A 
BRAND-NEW $250 MILLION PLANT IN 
FLORIDA, JUST LEFT FLORIDA, DID 
ANYBODY LIKE THAT ONE? 
WASN'T THAT GREAT? 
GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA. 
THAT WAS ANOTHER ONE. 
THAT WAS ANOTHER ONE. 
THEY SAY THE REPUBLICANS ARE 
GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME 
WINNING FLORIDA. 
WE WON FLORIDA QUICKLY. 
THEY ANNOUNCED THAT ONE EARLY 
IN THE NIGHT. 
AND WE'RE DOING BETTER. 
THE NICE PART, WE'RE DOING 
BETTER IN ALL OF THESE STATES 
THAN WE DID ON ELECTION NIGHT. 
MUCH BETTER. 
DESPITE ONLY NEGATIVE 
PUBLICITY, ONLY NEGATIVE 
STORIES FROM THE FAKERS BACK 
THERE -- I GO HOME, I SEE MY 
WIFE, I SAID, HONEY, WE'RE 
GOING TO GET THE GREATEST -- I 
DID SOMETHING SO GREAT TODAY, 
YOU KNOW? 
I JUST STOPPED MISSILES FROM 
BEING LAUNCHEDEVERY TWO 
SECONDS IN KOREA. 
BABY, WHAT I DID WAS -- WITH 
NORTH KOREA WAS GREAT. 
I GOT ALONG GREAT WITH CHAIRMAN 
KIM. I 
GOT ALONG GREAT. 
THAT'S A GOOD THING, NOT A BAD 
THING, BY THE WAY. 
I GOT ALONG -- AND YOU KNOW 
WHAT? 
BABY, I GOT THE HOSTAGES BACK. 
DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING. 
>>  
>> AND YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY, 
THEY'RE NOT TESTING ANY MORE, 
NUCLEAR, THEY HAVEN'T HAD A 
TEST IN NINE MONTHS. 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE? 
THEY'RE NOT SENDING ROCKETS 
OVER JAPAN. 
AND THEY'RE NOT SENDING 
MISSILES OVER JAPAN. 
AND THEY'RE NOT LAUNCHING 
MISSILES ANYMORE. 
THEY HAVEN'T LAUNCHED ONE IN 
NINE MONTHS. 
I SAID, OH, THE MEDIA IS GOING 
TO TREAT ME, FINALLY, SO GOOD. 
SO GOOD. 
I MEAN, IT'S GOING TO BE SO 
GREAT, BABY, I'M LOOKING SO 
FORWARD TO GETTING UP TOMORROW 
AND READING THOSE DYING PAPERS. 
AND WHAT DO I READ? 
WHAT DO I READ? 
SO I LEFT THREE MONTHS AGO. 
WHAT DO I READ? 
THEY'VE BEEN WORKING THIS STUFF 
FOR 75 YEARS. 
OBAMA DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. 
IN ALL FAIRNESS, OTHER 
ADMINISTRATIONS DID NOTHING. 
THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR 
SO MANY DECADES. 
WHAT DO I READ? 
I LEFT THREE MONTHS AGO. 
DONALD TRUMP ISN'T MOVING FAST 
ENOUGH. 
DO YOU BELIEVE -- I'M NOT MOVING
FAST ENOUGH. 
OH, BOY. 
WHAT A GROUP. 
WHAT A GROUP. 
YOU KNOW, ANOTHER ONE, IN 
HELSINKI, I HAD A GREAT MEETING 
WITH PUTIN. 
WE DISCUSSED EVERYTHING. 
I HAD A GREAT MEETING. 
>>  
>> WE GOT ALONG REALLY WELL. 
BY THE WAY, THAT'S A GOOD 
THING. 
NOT A BAD THING. 
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING. 
NOW, WE ARE BEING HINDERED BY 
THE RUSSIAN HOAX. 
IT'S A HOAX, OKAY? 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. 
RUSSIA IS VERY UNHAPPY THAT 
TRUMP WON. 
THAT I CAN TELL YOU. 
BUT I GOT ALONG GREAT WITH 
PUTIN. 
AND EVERYBODY SAID, WOW, THAT 
WAS GREAT. 
A COUPLE HOURS LATER, I STARTED 
HEARING THESE REPORTS, THAT, 
YOU KNOW, THEY WANTED ME TO 
WALK UP -- HERE'S A
PODIUM -- THEY WANTED ME TO 
WALK UP AND GO LIKE THIS, THEY 
WANTED ME TO GO UP AND HAVE A 
BOXING MATCH. 
I SAID, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO 
DIPLOMACY? 
AND BY THE WAY, WHATEVER 
HAPPENED TO DIPLOMACY? 
YOU KNOW, I USED TO STUDY -- 
NOT TOO MUCH -- DIPLOMACY. 
I SAID, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO 
GETTING EVERYTHING YOU WANT? 
SOME YOU HAVE TO BE ROUGH, SOME 
YOU HAVE TO BE NICE, BUT 
WHATEVER HAPPENED? 
AND LET ME TELL YOU, IF I DID 
GO UP AND START SCREAMING, THEY 
WOULD HAVE SAID, HE WAS 
TERRIBLE. 
HE WAS SO RUDE. 
IT WAS HORRIBLE. 
HIS PERFORMANCE WAS HORRIBLE. 
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO FAIR 
PRICE? 
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HONEST 
REPORTING?  
-- FAIR PRICE -- PRESS. 
WE HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH 
RUSSIA, WE HAD A GREAT MEETING 
WITH PUTIN, THEY JUST HAMMERED 
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT I WAS 
SOFT. 
SOFT? 
I MEAN, I WAS THE ONE THAT LET 
OUT SICKLY -- 60 DIPLOMATS, I 
WAS THE ONE THAT COMPLAINED 
ABOUT THE FACT THAT GERMANY IS 
PAYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR 
A RIDICULOUS PIPELINE COMING 
INTO GERMANY. 
PAYING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS A YEAR, TO RUSSIA. 
I WAS THE ONE THAT COMPLAINED 
ABOUT IT. 
WE HAD A BAD CONFLICT IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST, WHICH I HATE. 
BUT WE HAD A CONFLICT. 
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DIED. 
AND IT WAS HORRIBLE. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DIED. 
AND I HATE IT. 
BUT WE ARE GOING TO WIN ALL THE 
TIME, FOLKS. 
WE'RE GOING TO WIN ALL THE 
TIME. 
BUT IF I GET ALONG WITH VLADIMIR
PUTIN, THAT'S A GOOD THING, 
FOLKS. 
NOT A BAD THING. 
GOOD. 
IT'S A GOOD THING.
THEN, THEN I MET WITH NATO. 
NOW, NATO IN ALL FAIRNESS, 29 
COUNTRIES INCLUDING US -- NATO 
HAS BEEN RIPPING US, WE'VE BEEN 
DEFENDING EUROPE,
AND THEY'RE NOT PAYING THEIR 
BILLS. 
SO I WENT IN AND I SAID, FOLKS, 
YOU'VE GOT TO PAY UP. 
YOUR DELINQUENT. 
THEY'LL BE PAYING $200 BILLION. 
IT TOOK ME ONE HOUR. 
BUT IT WAS A ROUGH HOUR. 
>> 
>> THE HEAD OF NATO, SECRETARY 
GENERAL STOLTENBERG, SAID TO 
THE PRESS, THEY DON'T REPORT IT,
THEY ONLY MAKE UP STORIES, THEY 
ONLY MAKE UP -- SO WHAT 
HAPPENED -- HE SAID LAST YEAR 
ALONE, BECAUSE OF WHAT I DID, 
THE PREVIOUS YEAR -- WE TOOK IN 
$44 BILLION MORE -- YOU HAVE TO 
UNDERSTAND, THIS IS MONEY TO 
GUARD AGAINST RUSSIA. 
I WOULDN'T SAY PUTIN IS 
THRILLED ABOUT THAT. 
NOT THRILLED. 
44 -- NOW, THEY WILL BE TAKING 
IN OVER -- A SHORT PERIOD OF 
YEARS -- $200 BILLION, 200 
BILLION, ARE YOU OKAY? 
OKAY? 
ARE THEY OKAY? 
YOU ARE ALL RIGHT? 
WE GOT TO STICK WITH OUR PEOPLE 
THAT WAIT HERE FOR HOURS AND 
HOURS. 
RIGHT? 
COME ON. 
ARE YOU OKAY, DARLING? 
GOOD. 
SHE LOOKS GOOD. 
WE GOT TO STICK WITH THOSE 
PEOPLE. 
ANYBODY IN THIS FRONT ROW 
THAT'S BEEN HERE FOR MANY HOURS 
-- THANK YOU, DARLING. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
AND COME BACK. 
IF YOU WANT, COME BACK AFTER 
YOU GET A LITTLE BIT BETTER, 
YOU COME BACK, DARLING, OKAY? 
COME BACK. 
ALL RIGHT? 
MAKE SURE SHE GETS BACK. 
WE'LL BRING HER UP HERE. 
>>  BEAUTIFUL. 
THANK YOU. 
SO I RAISED 44 BILLION LAST 
YEAR. 
AND YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF 
YOU KNOW, NATO FUNDING WAS 
GOING DOWN. 
AND THEY SAID, OUR OTHER 
PRESIDENTS, I WON'T BE 
PARTICULAR -- OF COURSE YOU ARE 
ONLY DEALING WITH LET'S SAY 
THREE PEOPLE -- WE WON'T GO 
BACK ANY FURTHER THAN THAT -- 
THEY WOULD COME, THEY WOULD 
MAKE A SPEECH, THAT SAYS -- 
WOULD YOU PLEASE PAY A LITTLE 
MORE MONEY? 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GOOD LUCK, 
THEY LEAVE, NOBODY WOULD PAY. 
NEXT ONE WOULD COME, YOU KNOW, 
NATO, THEY DON'T PAY ANY MONEY, 
WE ARE DEFENDING EUROPE. 
COULD YOU PLEASE PAY A LITTLE 
BIT MORE MONEY? 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 
IT'S BEEN WONDERFUL MEETING 
YOU. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
LUXEMBOURG. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
THEY DON'T PAY! 
THE NEXT ONE COMES, SAME THING. 
AND I CAME AND I SAID, FELLAS, 
YOUR DELINQUENT. 
YOU'VE GOT TO PAY. 
YOU GOT TO PAY!  
-- YOU'RE DELINQUENT. 
AND ONE OF THE LEADERS SAID, 
WELL, MR. PRESIDENT, COULD I 
ASK YOU A QUESTION? 
IF WE DON'T PAY, WHAT ARE YOU 
GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? 
I SAID, DO YOU WANT PROTECTION 
OR NOT? 
DO YOU WANT PROTECTION OR NOT? 
SO I SAID TO MY WIFE, YOU KNOW, 
I JUST RAISED LIKE A COUPLE OF 
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS, AND IT 
WAS LIKE, SO EASY. 
IT WAS SO EASY. 
I SAID, HONEY, WAIT TILL YOU 
SEE THE PRESS I GET ON THIS, 
IT'S COMING. 
GOING TO BE GREAT! 
AND HERE'S WHAT THE FAKE NEWS 
SAID. 
LARGELY. 
THEY SAID, DONALD TRUMP, OUR 
PRESIDENT, WAS EXTREMELYRUDE! 
TO PRESIDENTS AND PRIME 
MINISTERS AND IN A COUPLE OF 
CASES, DICTATORS, BUT THAT'S 
ALL RIGHT. 
THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS VERY 
RUDE. 
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE MONEY 
I RAISED. 
I WAS RUDE. 
AND I WASN'T. 
ACTUALLY, I HAVE A BETTER 
RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERY ONE OF 
THEM THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT 
HAS HAD. 
EVERY ONE. 
>> 
>> AND THEY RESPECT US AGAIN. 
THEY RESPECT US AGAIN. 
SO NATO IS VERY WELL-FUNDED, 
THESE COUNTRIES ARE STARTING TO 
 
GOT TO PAY UP! 
FOLKS, YOU GOT TO PAY UP. 
YOU KNOW, WE WENT THROUGH THE 
ENTIRE ROOM, AND THE LAST 
GENTLEMEN, A PRIME MINISTER, 
SAID, YOU KNOW, WE ARE ALL 
SAYING HOW WONDERFUL EVERYTHING 
IS, BUT I DON'T THINK THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
IS HAPPY. 
NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THAT. 
AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, 
PRESIDENT, THIS IS BEFORE THEY 
MADE THE COMMITMENT, I SAID, 
PRESIDENT, ARE YOU HAPPY, TO 
ME? 
I SAID, NO, THANK YOU FOR 
BRINGING IT UP. 
THIS IS AFTER THEY WENT THROUGH 
28 PEOPLE. 
I SAID, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 
BRINGING IT UP. 
AND THIS GENTLEMAN, MAYBE 
THEY'LL FIND A TRANSCRIPT, HE 
SAID, WE GOT TO MAKE THE 
PRESIDENT HAPPY. 
THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO BE 
HAPPY IS YOU GOT TO PAY YOUR 
BILLS, FOLKS. 
YOU GOT TO PAY YOUR BILLS. 
BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES IS 
NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO SPEND 
OUR MONEY, OUR SWEAT, OUR TEARS,
OUR BLOOD, ON PEOPLE THAT 
AREN'T. I 
DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT, AND 
I SAID TO THEM AS A ROOM, I 
SAID, I'M ALL FOR NATO. 
ONE THING I KNOW, IS THAT NATO, 
WHICH PROTECTS EUROPE, IS 
BETTER FOR EUROPE THAN IT IS 
FOR THE UNITED STATES. 
WE ARE WAY FAR AWAY. 
YOU LISTEN TO SOME OF THE 
GENERALS, SIR, THEY ARE AN 
ALLY. 
WE MUST PROTECT THEM. 
THEY ARE A LONG WAY AWAY. 
I'M ALL FOR NATO. 
YOU KNOW WHY? 
BECAUSE NOW THE MONEY IS 
POURING IN. 
AND THEY SAID I TREATED THEM 
BADLY. 
AND I DIDN'T. 
I HAVE SUCH A GREAT 
RELATIONSHIP -- SO I'M VERY 
PROUD OF IT. 
WHEN I WOKE UP, I SAID THIS IS 
GOING TO BE GREAT, FINALLY, I'M 
 
THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT. 
AND I GOT HAMMERED BY EVEN 
NATO. 
SO NATO IS IN GREAT SHAPE. 
OUR COUNTRY IS IN GREAT SHAPE. 
WE ARE SO STRONG AGAIN. 
SO STRONG. 
WE ARE SO STRONG. 
>> 
>>  USA! 
>> SHOULD I GIVE YOU ONE MORE OF
THOSE CRAZY STORIES? 
THIS WAS ON THE TRIP. 
ONE MORE? 
SO I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE 
UK. 
UNITED KINGDOM. 
GREAT RESPECT. 
PEOPLE CALL IT BRITAIN, THEY 
CALL IT GREAT BRITAIN, THEY 
USED TO CALL IT ENGLAND, 
DIFFERENT PARTS. 
BUT THE UK, GREAT RESPECT, AND 
I WAS ASKED TO HAVE TEA WITH 
THE QUEEN, WHO IS INCREDIBLE BY 
THE WAY. 
INCREDIBLE. 
SO I WAS HEARING -- I HAD 
LANDED -- AND I'M ON THE GROUND 
-- AND I'M WAITING WITH THE 
KINGS AND WITH THE QUEEN'S 
GUARDS. 
WONDERFUL PEOPLE. 
I'M WAITING! 
SO I WAS ABOUT 15 MINUTES EARLY 
AND I'M WAITING WITH MY WIFE AND
THAT'S FINE. 
HEY, IT'S THE QUEEN, RIGHT? 
WE CAN WAIT. 
BUT I'M A LITTLE EARLY. 
SO I THEN GO UP AND MEET THE 
QUEEN. 
AND SHE IS FANTASTIC. 
WE THEN GO UP AND WE HAVE TEA. 
AND I DIDN'T KNOW THIS, IT WAS 
SUPPOSED TO LAST FOR 15 MINUTES 
BUT IT LASTED FOR LIKE AN HOUR. 
BECAUSE WE GOT ALONG! 
WE GOT ALONG. 
AND SHE LIKED OUR FIRST LADY. 
AND OUR FIRST LADY LIKED HER. 
AND I WANT TALK ABOUT 
CONVERSATION. 
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO. 
UNLESS YOU WANT TO HEAR THEM. 
I'M ONLY KIDDING. 
WE GOT ALONG FANTASTICALLY 
WELL. 
AND THE TIME WENT BY. 
YOU KNOW, LIKE SOMETIMES IF YOU 
LIKE SOMEBODY, YOU GET ALONG, 
GOOD CHEMISTRY, TIME GOES BY, 
WE WERE THERE FOR ABOUT AN 
HOUR. 
SO HERE'S THE STORY. 
I GOT THERE, REMEMBER, I GOT 
THERE EARLY, AND THE QUEENS 
GUARD WAITED WITH ME -- IN FACT 
WE TOOK A HELICOPTER -- SEE ALL 
THESE SECRET SERVICE GUYS? 
THEY'RE NOT LATE. 
THEY ARE NOT LIKE, LATE. 
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN BEING 
LATE. 
THEY ARE INCREDIBLE. 
THEY BELIEVE IN BEING EARLY. 
NOT LATE. 
ONE OF THEM SAID TO ME, SIR, WE 
WANT LATE. 
SO HERE IS THE STORY BY THE 
FAKE NEWS. 
THE PRESIDENT WAS 15 MINUTES 
LATE FOR THE QUEEN. 
WRONG. 
AND THEN, HERE'S THE REST OF 
THE STORY, HERE'S THE REST. 
HERE'S THE REST OF THE STORY. 
SO THEY SAID I WAS LATE. 
WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY EARLY. 
NUMBER 1. NUMBER 2, I GUESS THE 
MEETING WAS SCHEDULED FOR 15 
MINUTES. 
AND IT LASTED FOR ALMOST AN 
HOUR. 
THE PRESIDENT OVERSTAYED -- SO 
I WAS LATE AND I OVERSTAYED! 
AND HONESTLY, FOLKS, IT WAS 
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL 
VISIT AND AFTERNOON. 
BUT THEY CAN MAKE ANYTHING BAD. 
BECAUSE THEY ARE THE FAKE, 
FAKE, DISGUSTING NEWS. 
>> 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
LET'S GET BACK TO SOME BORING 
SUBJECTS LIKE BOB CASEY. 
SO BOB CASEY -- ISN'T THAT 
BORING AFTER THESE WONDERFUL -- 
I GOT TO TALK ABOUT BOB CASEY? 
I'LL START FALLING ASLEEP. 
DON'T FALL ASLEEP AS WE TALK 
ABOUT SLEEPING BOB. 
SLEEPING BOB. 
HA! THAT'S IT. 
SLEEPING BOB. 
THAT'S IT! 
THAT'S IT! 
>>  
>> SLEEPING BOB! 
SO BOB CASEY, BOB CASEY IS FOR 
OPEN BORDERS. 
IN OTHER WORDS, LOOK, FOLKS, 
HEY FOLKS, I WENT TO SCHOOL IN 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
I WENT TO A GREAT SCHOOL. 
IN PHILADELPHIA. 
GREAT. 
THE BEST. 
I WENT TO THE BEST SCHOOL. 
AND YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT, 
BUT I WAS A VERY GOOD STUDENT. 
THESE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER TELL 
YOU THAT. 
BUT YOU KNOW, I KNOW THE PEOPLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA VERY WELL. 
AND THEY'RE NOT FOR SUPER 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS. 
JUST NOT. 
UNLESS MAYBE THE WORLD HAS 
CHANGED. 
BUT BOB CASEY WANTS OPEN 
BORDERS, WHICH MEANS CRIME. 
IT MEANS CRIME. 
YOU SEE THIS. 
HE WANTS PEOPLE TO POUR IN. 
AND IF THEY POUR IN BY THE 
MILLIONS, THAT'S, I GUESS, 
OKAY? I 
DON'T GET IT. 
LOU, LOU, YEAH. 
BUILD IT. 
WE'RE BUILDING IT. 
WE'RE BUILDING IT. 
WE'RE BUILDING IT. 
SO WE'VE STARTED THE WALL, 1.6 
BILLION. 
WE ARE FIXING WALLS ALL OVER 
THE BORDER. 
AND WE ARE GOING TO START TO 
GET VERY NASTY OVER THE WALL. 
YOU KNOW, THE DEMOCRATS -- 
ANYTHING I WANT, IT'S NOT EVEN 
THE REPUBLICANS -- I DON'T KNOW 
IF THEY CARE
ABOUT -- THEY CARE ABOUT ME. 
THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED. 
ANYTHING I WANT, THEY WANT TO 
OPPOSE. 
I JUST FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO 
THE WALL. 
I'LL SAY I DON'T WANT TO BUILD 
THE WALL AND THEY'LL INSIST ON 
BUILDING IT. 
>> 
>> I JUST FIGURED THAT OUT 
RIGHT NOW. 
SO BOB CASEY DOESN'T MIND MS-13 
COMING IN. 
THESE ARE THE SLICES -- THEY 
SLICE PEOPLE UP -- REMEMBER I 
CALLED THEM ANIMALS -- AND 
NANCY PELOSI! 
SCOLDED ME. 
HOW DARE HE CALL ANOTHER HUMAN 
BEING AN ANIMAL? 
THEY'RE ANIMALS! 
>>  
>> BOB CASEY WANTS TO FIRE THE 
INCREDIBLE MEN AND WOMEN OF 
I.C.E., HE WANTS TO ABOLISH 
I.C.E. 
>>  
>> BECAUSE HE'S WEAK. 
LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING, 
THESE PEOPLE ARE SO TOUGH, AND 
YOU NEED TOUGH, BECAUSE THE 
ONLY THING THAT MS-13 AND THESE 
GANGS THAT WE ARE THROWING THE 
HELL OUT OF HERE AT RECORD 
NUMBERS, WE ARE DOING A GOOD 
JOB --
BUT THE ONLY THING THAT THESE 
GANGS UNDERSTAND IS TOUGH. 
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND A NICE 
PERSON. 
LIKE THE GENTLEMAN IN THE 
SECOND ROW, HE'S A NICE MAN, I 
CAN SEE. 
SIR, YOU WOULDN'T LAST TWO 
MINUTES TALKING TO I.C.E. 
I HATE TO SAY IT. 
HIS WIFE KNOWS I'M TELLING THE 
TRUTH. 
WE NEED STRONG PEOPLE. 
I HAVE A SHERIFF WHO IS A GREAT 
FRIEND OF MINE. 
AND HE SAID, HE'S HAD A PROBLEM 
WITH MS-13 PEOPLE -- HE SAID TO 
ME, YOU KNOW SOMETHING, 
PESIDENT? I 
REALLY DON'T MIND IF I.C.E. 
COMES IN AND DOES THE JOB. I 
REALLY DON'T WANT -- YOU KNOW, 
THIS IS TOUGH STUFF. 
THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THESE 
INCREDIBLE WARRIORS. 
THEY'RE WARRIORS. 
WE ARE FIGHTING A WAR ON DRUGS. 
THEY ARE BRINGING IN DRUGS, 
THEY'RE BRINGING LOTS OF BAD 
PEOPLE, WE ARE GETTING THE HELL 
-- WE'RE STOPPING IT. 
SO WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKING 
SOME VERY TOUGH ACTIONS. 
GOING TO BE TAKING SOME TOUGH 
ACTIONS. 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BEFORE THE 
ELECTION OR AFTER THE ELECTION. 
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THE 
REPUBLICANS SAY -- AND THEY'RE 
GOOD -- WE NEED MORE 
REPUBLICANS BUT THEY'RE FRIENDS 
OF MINE -- THEY SAY, PRESIDENT, 
YOU KNOW, AND SOME OF THEM ARE 
REALLY TOUGH GUYS AND THEY SAID,
SIR, WE ARE
BETTER OFF IF WE WAIT TILL 
AFTER. 
I SAY, IT'S BETTER BEFORE. 
LET'S DO IT BEFORE. 
SIR, WE'RE BETTER OFF -- YOU 
KNOW WHO THINKS IT SHOULD BE 
BEFORE -- RUSH LIMBAUGH THINKS 
IT SHOULD BE BEFORE. 
BEFORE THE ELECTION. 
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE? 
SEAN HANNITY. 
A LOT OF THEM. 
A LOT OF THEM. 
GREAT PEOPLE. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK -- BUT A 
LOT OF GREAT REPUBLICANS -- 
WELL-MEANING -- I DON'T MEAN 
LIKE -- THEY'RE WELL-MEANING -- 
THEY SAY, LOOK, WE HAVE THE 
BEST ECONOMY EVER, WE'RE DOING 
GREAT, MAYBE WE DON'T WANT TO 
COMPLICATE IT AND I UNDERSTAND 
IT. 
I'M A LITTLE TORN MYSELF. I 
WOULD PERSONALLY PREFER BEFORE, 
BUT WHETHER IT'S BEFORE OR 
AFTER, WE ARE EITHER GETTING IT 
OR WE'RE CLOSING DOWN 
GOVERNMENT. 
WE NEED BORDER SECURITY. 
WE NEED BORDER SECURITY. 
>> 
>> WE GOT TO HAVE BORDER 
SECURITY, WE GOT TO GET RID OF 
VISA -- HOW ABOUT THAT? 
VISA, VISA LOTTERY. 
YOU KNOW WHAT A LOTTERY IS? 
YOU PICK IT OUT OF A HAT. 
NOW, DO YOU THINK THAT THESE 
COUNTRIES, MANY OF WHOM GET AID 
FROM US, AND THEN THEY SAID -- 
REMEMBER WHEN I DID -- HATE TO 
SAY IT -- COME DOWN THE 
ESCALATOR, THE BEAUTIFUL FIRST 
LADY IN THE WHITE DRESS COMING 
DOWN THAT
ESCALATOR -- THAT BIG, BIG 
BEAUTIFUL DAY -- WHEN EVERYBODY 
SAID, OH, HE'S JUST DOING THIS 
FOR FUN. 
HE DOESN'T REALLY MEAN IT. 
MAN, IF I DON'T MEAN IT, I HOPE 
YOU TELL ME SOON. 
BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF WORK. 
BUT COMING DOWN THE ESCALATOR, 
AND YOU REMEMBER WHAT I SAID, 
THEY ARE SENDING -- REMEMBER 
THAT -- THEY'RE SENDING -- AND 
I MENTIONED WORDS -- I WON'T 
EVEN MENTION THEM TONIGHT 
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF YOUNG 
PEOPLE HERE -- BUT I MENTIONED 
WORDS -- AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT 
IT WAS WONDERFUL. 
BUT THEN ABOUT TWO DAYS LATER, 
THEY SAID, DID HE SAY THIS? 
DID HE SAY THAT? 
GUESS WHAT. 
WHAT I SAID IS PEANUTS COMPARED 
TO WHAT TURNS OUT TO BE THE 
TRUTH. 
IT'S PEANUTS. 
SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE -- NOT 
LOTTERY WHERE YOU PICK IT OUT 
-- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, OUR 
FIRST LOTTERY WINNER -- YOU 
KNOW THEY THINK WE ARE PLAYING 
LIKE A GAME SHOW. 
OUR FIRST LOTTERY WINNER -- 
LET'S SEE, HE HAS SEVEN 
CONVICTIONS FOR DEATH. 
HE'S KILLED NINE PEOPLE. 
AND WE ARE GETTING HIM THE HELL 
OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. 
AND GIVING THEM TO THE STUPID 
POLITICIANS THAT HAVE BEEN 
RUNNING THE UNITED STATES FOR 
MANY YEARS. 
AND WE'RE GOING TO SEND HIM UP 
THERE BECAUSE HE JUST WON THE 
LOTTERY. 
CONGRATULATIONS. 
CONGRATULATIONS. 
YEAH, THAT'S A BEAUTY. 
THEN YOU HAVE CHAIN MIGRATION. 
CHAIN MIGRATION. 
AND THIS WAS THE SCHUMER DEAL. 
SCHUMER WANTED THIS. 
SCHUMER. 
YOU HAVE CHAIN MIGRATION. 
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS. 
A GUY COMES IN, STONE COLD 
KILLER IN MANY CASES, A GUY 
COMES IN, AND THEN YOU HAVE TO 
BRING HIS AUNT, HIS UNCLE, HIS 
FATHER, HIS GRANDFATHER, HIS 
GRANDPARENTS, HIS THIRD NIECE BY
A DIFFERENT MARRIAGE, SO THIS 
BAD GUY
THAT RAN OVER AND KILLED EIGHT 
PEOPLE ON THE WEST SIDE HIGHWAY 
-- IN NEW YORK CITY -- A PLACE 
I KNOW VERY WELL -- DRIVING 
LIKE 80 MILES AN HOUR IN A 20-
MILE ZONE -- AND THEN HE SAID, 
HEY, LOOK, THERE'S PEOPLE, NICE 
PEOPLE, THEY'RE RELAXING, SOME 
ARE JOGGING, BEAUTIFUL PARK 
ALONG THE HUDSON RIVER -- HE 
DECIDES TO KILL THEM. 
SO HE MAKES A RIGHT TURN, HE 
KILLED EIGHT, AND MANY ARE JUST 
DECAPITATED. 
THEY LOST ARMS, THEY LOST LIMBS,
THEY LOST SO MUCH. 
THEY LOST THEIR LIFE. 
BUT THEY LOST SO MUCH. 
YOU KNOW, NOBODY EVER TALKS 
ABOUT THE SERIOUSLY INJURED 
PEOPLE. 
THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE 
PEOPLE THAT DIED. 
IN SOME CASES, THOSE ARE THE 
LUCKY ONES. 
WHAT HAPPENS WITH SOME OF THESE 
PEOPLE, HOW BADLY INJURED THEY 
ARE, THEIR LIVES ARE SO BADLY 
DESTROYED -- AND THIS ANIMAL 
KILLED EIGHT, AND HE WOUNDED 
EIGHT OR NINE, SOME ARE STILL IN
THE HOSPITAL -- THAT WAS A YEAR 
AND A HALF AGO -- AND HE CAME IN
THROUGH CHAIN -- AND HE HAS 22 
RELATIVES HERE THAT CAME IN 
BECAUSE HE WAS HERE. 
HE HAS HIS UNCLE AND HIS AUNT, 
AND HE HAS HIS GRANDFATHER, SO 
WE HAVE TO CHANGE THIS. 
AND WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE IT. 
AND HERE'S THE LAST -- WE HAVE 
TO CHANGE -- WE HAVE TO CHANGE 
A THING CALLED CATCH AND 
RELEASE. 
THIS IS LIKE, FOR STUPID 
PEOPLE. 
CATCH AND RELEASE. 
SOMEBODY WALKS ACROSS THE 
BORDER, THEY PUT -- NOT EVEN 
TWO FEET, JUST ONE FOOT -- AND 
YOU MIGHT AS WELL -- WELCOME TO 
THE UNITED STATES, WE WILL 
NEVER GET YOU OUT OF HERE. 
OKAY? 
REMEMBER WHEN I SET ABOUT A 
MONTH AGO -- I SAID, NO, THEY 
WANT ME TO HIRE THOUSANDS OF 
JUDGES. 
THOUSANDS. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE CORRUPTION 
THAT WOULD TAKE PLAC? 
HIRING THOUSANDS -- YOU GO INTO 
A BARBERSHOP, AND YOU WORRY -- 
ANYBODY WANT TBE A JUDGE? 
THEY WANT ME TO HIRE THOUSANDS 
OF -- I SAID, WE DON'T NEED 
JUDGES. 
WE NEED BORDER PATROL. 
WE NEED BORDER PATROL. 
IF YOU HAVE A HOUSE, AND 
SOMEBODY GOES TO SLEEP ON YOUR 
LAWN AND YOU SAY, SORRY, FOLKS, 
GET OUT OF HERE. 
IF YOU CALL THE POLICE, THEY'RE 
GOING TO REMOVE -- IT'S YOUR 
LAWN, THIS IS OUR COUNTRY, THIS 
IS OUR COUNTRY. 
GET THE HELL OUT. 
AND WE'RE DOING REALLY WELL BUT 
WE HAVE REALLY BAD LAWS. 
WE ARE SETTING RECORD NUMBERS 
IN TERMS OF POSITIVE STUFF BUT 
WE HAVE BAD LAWS. 
SO CATCH AND RELEASE, YOU CATCH 
THEM, NOW YOU TAKE HIS NAME, 
AND THEN YOU RELEASE HIM. 
AND HE IS SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP 
TO A COURT HEARING. 
THE PROBLEM IS, THERE'S 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE -- WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH 
JUDGES -- BUT HOPEFULLY THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL GET 
MOVING ON THAT -- HOPEFULLY -- 
COME ON, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, 
GET US SOME JUDGES OVER THERE, 
FOCUS, FOCUS. 
SO THEY COME BACK THREE OR FOUR 
YEARS LATER, BUT HERE'S THE 
PROBLEM. 
THEY NEVER COME BACK! 
THEY DON'T COME BACK. 
WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY COME 
BACK? 
SO A VERY TINY PERCENTAGE COMES 
BACK. 
SO YOU CATCH A STONE COLD 
CRIMINAL. 
YOU TAKE HIS NAME, YOU SEE HE'S 
A CRIMINAL. 
YOU SEE HE'S BAD IN MANY CASES. 
CATCH AND RELEASE. 
YOU CATCH HIM AND YOU THEN 
RELEASE HIM. 
AND HE NOW GOES INTO YOUR 
WONDERFUL TOWNS. 
HE NOW COMES TO THE WONDERFUL 
STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. 
CATCH AND RELEASE! 
WE HAVE TO END IT. 
SO WE HAVE TO END CATCH AND 
RELEASE. 
WE HAV TO END OUR LOTTERY 
SYSTEM. 
AND WE HAVE TO END CHAIN 
MIGRATION. 
AND WE HAVE TO BUILD THE WALL 
AND WE'RE GOING TO BUILD IT. 
AND BOB CASEY IS AGAINST EVERY 
ONE OF THE THINGS I JUST SAID. 
HE WANTS THE LOTTERY SYSTEM. 
HE WANTS CHAIN MIGRATION. 
BY THE WAY, IF YOU ASK HIM WHY, 
HE WANTS IT BECAUSE SCHUMER 
SAID TO HAVE IT. 
THEY THINK IT'S GOOD 
POLITICALLY. 
I TELL YOU WHAT, I THINK IT'S 
HORRIBLE POLITICALLY. 
WHAT DO I KNOW? 
I DID BECOME PRESIDENT IN LIKE 
A YEAR AND A HALF. 
SO WE NEED REPUBLICANS, WE NEED 
LOU BARLETTA. 
HE IS TOUGH. 
WE NEED LOU BARLETTA. 
WE DO. 
HE'S TOUGH. 
THEY ARE LIKING YOU, LOU. 
THEY'RE LIKING YOU. 
I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT A 
LONG TIME -- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO 
IS MEET HIM, SEE HIM -- I HEAR 
THAT BOB CASEY IS AFRAID TO 
DEBATE LOU BARLETTA. 
HE DOESN'T WANT TO DEBATE HIM. 
I HEAR HE'S AFRAID TO DEBATE. 
IS THAT TRUE? 
I HEAR HE'S AFRAID TO DEBATE. 
I WANT TO WATCH THAT DEBATE. 
I WANT TO BE -- IS THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
ALLOWED TO COME INTO THE DEBATE 
FORUM WHERE YOU PROBABLY
HAVE 25 PEOPLE WATCHING -- AND 
HE IS -- IS HE ALLOWED TO SIT 
IN THE FRONT ROW WATCHING LOU 
BARLETTA DESTROY IN THE DEBATE 
BOB CASEY? 
AM I ALLOWED TO -- BECAUSE IF I 
AM, I'LL BE THERE. 
I'LL BE THERE. 
THAT WILL BE GREAT 
ENTERTAINMENT. 
THAT WILL BE GREAT 
ENTERTAINMENT. 
I'VE SEEN THIS ONE BEFORE. 
HE'S TOUGH. 
SO I WANT TO THANK REPUBLICAN 
LEADERSHIP, BECAUSE AMERICA IS 
WINNING AGAIN. 
>>  
>> LOU SAID IT BEFORE, BUT LAST 
WEEK WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE U.S. 
ECONOMY GREW AT 4.1% LAST 
QUARTER. 
NOBODY THOUGHT THAT WAS 
POSSIBLE. 
AND IF THE DEMOCRATS GOT IN, 
THAT NUMBER WOULD BE 1.2, IT 
COULD EVEN TURN NEGATIVE. 
IT WAS GOING TO GO DOWN. 
WE WERE SET -- BECAUSE OF THE 
REGULATIONS. 
IT WAS -- WE WERE BEING CHOKED. 
DON'T FORGET, I APPROVED THE 
KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE. 
AND I APPROVED THE DAKOTA 
ACCESS PIPELINE. 
48,000 JOBS. 
IN, LIKE, MY FIRST FEW HOURS IN 
OFFICE. 
SINCE THE ELECTION, WE'VE ADDED 
A NUMBER THAT NOBODY WOULD HAVE 
BELIEVED AND THAT I WOULD HAVE 
NEVER SAID ON THE CAMPAIGN 
TRAIL, I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT 
BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE DONE A 
BIG NUMBER ON ME. 
3.7MILLION NEW JOBS. 
INCLUDING CLOSE TO 400,000 JOBS 
IN THE MANUFACTURING WORLD. 
REMEMBER? 
REMEMBER? 
REMEMBER WHEN THEY SAID 
MANUFACTURING IS DEAD? 
IT IS? 
WHO'S GOING TO MAKE THINGS? 
I MEAN, TELL ME. 
MANUFACTURING IS DEAD THEY 
SAID. 
WE'VE ADDED 400,000 INCREDIBLE 
JOBS. 
YOU'VE HEARD THIS BUT I'M GOING 
TO SAY IT OVER AND OVER BECAUSE 
I'M REALLY PROUD OF IT. 
REMEMBER I SAID WHAT DO YOU 
HAVE TO LOSE? 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, SO MANY 
OTHERS, I SAID, WHAT DO YOU 
HAVE TO LOSE? 
YOU HAVE HIGH CRIME RATES, YOU 
HAVE HORRIBLE EDUCATION, YOU 
HAVE THIS -- I WENT THROUGH A 
LIST OF 10, THAT'S WHAT 
HAPPENED. 
AND I LOOKED AND I SAID, YOU'VE 
BEEN TOTALLY GIVING YOUR VOTES 
TO DEMOCRATS, THEY'VE LET YOU 
DOWN. 
I SAID, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU 
HAVE TO LOSE? 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 
THIS NEW ELECTION -- CERTAINLY 
THE NEXT ONE -- WHERE WE ARE 
GOING TO HAVE IT JUST KEEP 
AMERICA GREAT -- I TELL YOU, I 
LOVE THOSE HATS, BUT THEY'RE 
GOING TO BE -- YOU KNOW, MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
WILL MORPH INTO KEEP AMERICA 
GREAT, EXCLAMATION POINT. 
BUT DON'T LOSE THOSE HATS. 
THEY'LL BE VERY VALUABLE 
SOMEDAY. 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
MAYBE THE GREATEST SLOGAN EVER, 
RIGHT? 
RONALD REAGAN HAD ONE, LET'S 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT. 
I LIKE IT. 
BUT OURS IS BETTER. 
I LIKE OURS BETTER. 
SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THE AFRICAN-
AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS 
REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
>>  
>> HONESTLY, THINK OF THAT 
NUMBER, I REALLY THINK THAT'S 
HARD FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO BEAT. 
THINK OF THAT STATEMENT. 
I GOT THE LOWEST NUMBER FOR YOU 
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
HOW DO YOU TOP THAT? 
LET'S SAY I'M RUNNING AGAINST 
POCAHONTAS OR CRAZY BERNIE. 
I TELL YOU, I GOT TO HAND IT TO 
BERNIE. 
I SAW HIM UP THERE THE OTHER 
DAY -- THAT HAIR IS GETTING 
WHITER AND WHITER AND HE'S 
GETTING CRAZIER AND CRAZIER -- 
AND I SAW HIM -- WE'LL STOP 
DONALD TRUMP, WE ARE STOPPING 
THEM, WE'RE GOING TO STOP -- 
AND I LOOKED AT MY WIFE, I 
SAID, YOU KNOW IT, YOU GOT TO 
HAND IT TO THAT GUY, HE DOESN'T 
QUIT. 
AND THAT'S OKAY. 
CRAZY BERNIE. 
HE IS ONE CRAZY DUDE. 
SO I DON'T KNOW WHO WE ARE GOING
TO RUN AGAINST. 
I DON'T KNOW. 
BUT WHEN BERNIE TELLS WONDERFUL 
THINGS -- THINK OF IT, HE WANTS 
TO RAISE YOUR TAXES, HE WANTS TO
CREATE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF 
CRIME, HE WANTS TO OPEN YOUR 
BORDERS, THINK OF IT, JUST 
THINK OF IT, WHEN HE GOES OUT 
-- AND I SAY ONE THING -- 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC, 
ASIAN -- YOU HAVE THE LOWEST 
LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
HOW DOES SOMEBODY FIGHT THAT, 
RIGHT? 
HOW DOES SOMEBODY FIGHT IT? 
RIGHT? 
>> 
>> HOW DO YOU FIGHT THAT? 
DON'T FORGET, WHEN I WAS 
RUNNING THE LAST TIME AGAINST 
CROOKED HILLARY, WHAT HAPPENED? 
WHAT HAPPENED? 
I HAD NOTHING LIKE THAT. I 
SAID I WAS GOING TO DO THAT, 
BUT YOU HAD TO TAKE MY WORD FOR 
IT. 
ONE OF THESE GUYS SAID 
RECENTLY, WHETHER YOU LIKE HIM 
OR NOT, HE'S ACTUALLY FULFILLED 
MORE PROMISES THAN HE MADE. 
AND I HAVE. 
AND I HAVE. 
>> 
>> AND I HAD OBAMACARE DONE 
EXCEPT ONE GUY AT 2:00 IN THE 
MORNING WENT IN AND SAID -- HE 
WENT THUMBS DOWN. 
EVEN THOUGH HE CAMPAIGNED FOR 
YEARS REPEAL AND REPLACE. 
ALL RIGHT. 
BUT WE'VE DONE A NUMBER ON 
OBAMACARE, COMING UP WITH 
TREMENDOUS HEALTHCARE PLANS, 
WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF THE
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, THE MOST 
UNPOPULAR THING PROBABLY IN OUR 
COUNTRY. 
GONE. 
GONE! 
NO INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. 
WHERE YOU HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO 
PAY A FORTUNE AS A PENALTY IN 
ORDER NOT TO PAY A FORTUNE FOR 
BAD HEALTHCARE. 
THINK OF THAT. 
IS THAT A GOOD THING? I 
DON'T THINK SO. 
WE GOT RID OF IT, IT'S GONE. 
YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE 
COME UP TO ME AND SAID THANK YOU
VERY MUCH FOR GETTING RID OF THE
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE? 
SOUNDS SO NICE. 
ISN'T IT A BEAUTIFUL TERM? 
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS 
WONDERFUL. 
I'M ACTING PRESIDENTIAL NOW. 
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. 
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS A 
DISASTER. 
SOUNDS GOOD -- LIKE THE 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 
WAS NOT AFFORDABLE. 
REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON GOT 
UP AND SAID THE PROBLEM WITH 
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS THAT 
IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE. 
AND THEN YOU DIDN'T HEAR FROM 
HIM FOR TWO WEEKS BECAUSE HE 
GOT THE HELL KNOCKED OUT OF HIM 
BY CROOKED HILLARY. 
>>  
>> FOR TWO WEEKS, HE WENT DEAD 
SILENT, THEY WOULDN'T LET HIM 
OUT OF THE HOUSE. 
THE WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, 
I'M SORRY, WOMEN,  ! IS THE 
LOWEST IN ONLY 65 YEARS. 
NOT HISTORY. 
SORRY. 
BUT IT WILL BE LOW SOON. 
SO 65 YEARS. 
65 YEARS, BUT I WOULD ALMOST 
BET WITHIN TWO WEEKS OR THE 
NEXT TIME THIS INCREDIBLE 
STATISTICAL GROUP IS RELAXED 
AND RELEASED -- I WOULD SAY 
THAT PROBABLY THE WOMEN WILL BE 
HISTORICAL -- RIGHT? 
RIGHT? 
I THINK SO. 
BUT AT 65 YEARS, I'M DOING MY 
BEST. 
52% -- OH, THE WOMEN LIKE ME, 
YOU KNOW? 
>> 
>> THEY LIKE ME. 
THEY LIKE ME. 
I KEEP HEARING -- LOOK AT ALL 
THOSE SIGNS, PINK SIGNS WITH 
THE WOMEN, LOOK AT THAT. 
LOOK AT THAT. 
THE WOMEN HAVE BEEN GREAT. 
AND I THINK THEY ARE 
INCREDIBLE. 
THEY HAVE A HARDER JOB THAN ALL 
OF US, FELLAS, LET ME TELL YOU, 
THE WOMEN ARE GREAT. 
AND WE DID GREAT WITH THE 
WOMEN. 
IN FACT, I REMEMBER ON ELECTION 
NIGHT, THEY SAID, HOW THE HELL 
DID THIS HAPPEN? 
REMEMBER THEY WERE GIVING YOU 
PHONE NUMBERS ON THAT TOO? 
THE VETERANS UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 
HAS REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL IN 
18 YEARS AND THAT'S GOING TO GO 
UP -- MORE THAN
3.5 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN 
LIFTED OFF FOOD STAMPS. 
MORE THAN 4 MILLION AMERICANS 
ARE GOING TO RECEIVE JOB 
TRAINING UNDER OUR NEW 
WORKFORCE INITIATIVE. 
MANUFACTURING, CONSUMER AND 
BUSINESS CONFIDENCE HAS REACHED 
THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
I'D SAY THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. 
CONFIDENCE IS A GOOD THING. 
HAVING CONFIDENCE -- WHAT DO 
YOU THINK, HAVING CONFIDENCE IS 
GOOD, YEAH? 
IF YOU HAVE CONIDENCE AND YOU 
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, YOU 
CAN'T LOSE. 
THAT'S A GREAT STAT. 
THINK OF IT. 
ESSENTIALLY, BUSINESS, THE MOST 
CONFIDENT IN OUR COUNTRY. 
IT'S GREAT. 
THE UNITED STATES IS NOW A NET 
NATURAL GAS EXPORTER FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN 60 
YEARS. 
AND PENNSYLVANIA WORKERS ARE 
LEADING THE WAY. 
YOU ARE LEADING THE WAY. 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU EVEN KNOW 
THAT. 
RIGHT? 
NOW THAT WE HAVE THE BEST 
ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 
COUNTRY, THIS IS THE TIME TO 
STRAIGHTEN OUT THE WORST TRADE 
DEALS EVER MADE BY ANY COUNTRY 
ON EARTH AT ANY TIME. 
FOR GENERATIONS, PENNSYLVANIA 
STEEL AND PENNSYLVANIA COAL 
MADE THIS STATE THE CENTER OF 
THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD. 
THE WORKERS OF SCRANTON AND 
BETHLEHEM AND ALLENTOWN AND 
WILKES-BARRE WERE THE BACKBONE 
OF AMERICAN MIGHT. 
THEY REALLY WERE. 
THE BACKBONE OF OUR COUNTRY. 
THE BACKBONE OF AMERICAN 
STRENGTH AND MIGHT. 
BUT THE LOYALTY OF OUR WORKERS 
WAS REPAID WITH BETRAYAL. 
YOU ARE BETRAYED BY OUR 
POLITICIANS. 
YOU WERE BETRAYED BY THE PEOPLE 
THAT RAN OUR COUNTRY. 
BUT YOU'RE NOT BETRAYED 
ANYMORE. 
PENNSYLVANIA LOST 300 MENU -- 
300,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS. 
AND CHINA JOINED THE WTO. 
RIGHT NOW CHINA IS NOT TOO 
HAPPY WITH ME. 
BUT I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR 
PRESIDENT XI. 
AND I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR 
CHINA. 
IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT THAT OUR 
LEADERS WERE STUPID. 
FOR DECADES, OUR POLITICIANS 
RAN FOR OFFICE, PLEDGING TO 
CRACK DOWN ON UNFAIR TRADE. 
BUT THEY NEVER DID IT. 
BUT ONCE ELECTED, THEY DID 
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND OUR 
WORKERS AND OUR COUNTRY GOT 
RIPPED OFF LIKE NO COUNTRY EVER 
BEFORE, IN THE HISTORY OF THE 
WORLD. 
WE GOT RIPPED OFF. 
IT WAS A MASSIVE, MASSIVE 
TRANSFER OF WEALTH TO OTHER 
COUNTRIES. 
THE POLITICIANS JUST WATCHED AS 
OTHER COUNTRIES STOLE OUR JOBS, 
PLUNDERED OUR WEALTH, AND 
LOOTED THE CROWN JEWELS OF THE 
AMERICAN ECONOMY. 
BUT I AM NOT ANOTHER 
POLITICIAN. 
I KEEP MY PROMISES TO THE 
PEOPLE. 
I DIDN'T NEED THIS. 
I DIDN'T NEED THIS. 
I DIDN'T NEED IT! 
I HAD A VERY NICE LIFE. 
I DIDN'T NEED -- YOU KNOW, I 
USED TO ACTUALLY GET GOOD 
PRESS. 
I DIDN'T NEED THIS. 
BUT I LOVE IT. 
I LOVE IT BECAUSE WE ARE DOING 
THINGS THAT ARE HISTORIC. 
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN -- EVEN 
THESE PEOPLE BACK HERE, THESE 
HORRIBLE, HORRENDOUS PEOPLE -- 
EVEN THESE PEOPLE BACK THERE -- 
LOOK, LOOKS LIKE THE ACADEMY 
AWARDS OR SOMETHING, YOU EVER 
SEE THIS? 
IS THIS THE ACADEMY AWARDS 
YOU'RE DOING? 
EVEN THESE PEOPLE, THEY SAY, 
PROBABLY IN THE HISTORY OF THIS 
COUNTRY, MAYBE IN THE HISTORY 
OF THE WORLD, THERE HAS NEVER 
BEEN ANYTHING LIKE WHAT HAPPENED
IN NOVEMBER. 
OF '16. 
PROBABLY NEVER. 
PROBABLY NEVER HAPPENED. 
PROBABLY NEVER HAPPENED. 
I REALLY BELIEVE THERE'S NEVER 
BEEN -- I REMEMBER WATCHING ONE 
AND WE WERE STARTING TO DO 
REALLY WELL AND THAT LASTED TWO 
WEEKS. 
I HAD CROWDS LIKE THIS 
EVERYWHERE, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
OUTSIDE, THEY COULDN'T GET IN, 
I SAID, WHY ARE WE GOING TO 
LOSE? 
HILLARY WOULD COME IN AND HAVE 
350 PEOPLE. 
SHE WOULD BRING IN BEYONCE, AND 
THEN JAY-Z WOULD GET UP AND USE 
LANGUAGE SO BAD. 
IF I EVER USED THAT LANGUAGE I 
WOULD BE RUN OUT OF THE 
COUNTRY. 
THEY SAY TRUMP'S LANGUAGE IS 
VERY TOUGH. 
DID YOU EVER HEAR JAY-Z? AND 
SHE WOULD BRING IN BRUCE 
SPRINGSTEEN. 
AND THEN DRAW CROWDS -- THEY 
WERE DRAWING CROWDS, SMALLER 
THAN MY CROWDS. 
AND I SAID WHY ARE WE GOING TO 
LOSE? 
YOU KNOW WHAT? 
WE DIDN'T. 
BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS 
INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY 
STARTED OFF BY SAYING WE 
HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS 
SINCE RONALD REAGAN. 
I LIKE RONALD REAGAN. 
AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND 
BIGGER AND WILDER AND WILDER. 
AND THEN WE WON BY A LOT. 
DON'T FORGET IT WAS 306-223. 
THAT'S A LOT. 
REMEMBER? 
THERE IS NO WAY, ACCORDING TO 
FAKE NEWS CNN, THERE IS NO WAY 
FOR TRUMP TO GET TO 270. 
THERE IS NO PATH. 
REMEMBER THE EXPRESSION? 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE IS 
NO PATH FOR DONALD TRUMP TO GET 
TO 270. 
NO, THERE WASN'T, BUT 306 WAS 
NO PROBLEM. 
>> 
>> SO AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING 
OTHER COUNTRIES, WE ARE FINALLY 
REBUILDING OUR COUNTRY. 
IN THE NUMBERS THAT WERE JUST 
RELEASED, THE REPORTERS DIDN'T 
COVER THIS ONE, TO ME, IT WAS 
MAYBE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE 
4.1 BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BE 
DOING A LOT BETTER THAN THE 4.1 
AS THINGS GO -- FOR THE FIRST 
TIME, MAYBE, EVER, THE TRADE 
DEFICIT JUST FELL -- THINK OF 
THAT -- BY -- FOR THE QUARTER --
$52 BILLION. 
NOBODY REPORTS IT! 
WHY DON'T YOU REPORT THAT? 
JUST FELL BY $52 BILLION. 
AND BECAUSE OF OUR ECONOMIC 
PLANNING AND OUR CHARGING TAXES 
OR TARIFFS TO ALL OF THE 
DUMPERS OF STEEL ALL OVER OUR 
COUNTRY, AMERICA'S STEEL MILLS 
ARE ROARING AGAIN. 
OUR COUNTRY IS BEING RESPECTED 
AGAIN! 
BECAUSE WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING 
AMERICA FIRST. 
>>  
>> WE'VE ELIMINATED A RECORD 
NUMBER OF JOB CRUSHING 
REGULATIONS. 
I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES 
FROM THE UNFAIR AND VERY, VERY 
EXPENSIVE FOR OUR COUNTRY PARIS 
CLIMATE ACCORD. 
SO UNFAIR. 
THAT WAS ANOTHER GREAT RIPOFF. 
REPUBLICANS JUST PASSED THE 
BIGGEST TAX CUTS IN THE HISTORY 
OF OUR COUNTRY. 
AND THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO LIFT 
THEM WAY UP. 
REMEMBER THAT. 
WHEN YOU GO TO VOTE, THEY WANT 
TO END YOUR TAX CUTS AND THEY 
WANT TO LIFT IT UP SO THEY CAN 
WASTE YOUR MONEY
ON A LOT OF NONSENSE. 
AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, WE SAVED 
OUR FAMILY FARMS AND OUR SMALL 
BUSINESSES FROM THE ESTATE TAX, 
ALSO KNOWN AS
THE DEATH TAX. 
NO LONGER THE DEATH TAX. 
NO LONGER WILL THEY PAY THE 
ESTATE TAX. 
OUR FAMILY FARMERS -- THE 
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS GONE, THE 
PENALTY IS GONE, THROUGH 
ASSOCIATED HEALTH PLANS, YOU 
KNOW THAT, THE ASSOCIATION 
HEALTH PLANS ARE GIVING US AND 
ALLOWING AMERICANS TO JOIN 
FORCES TO BUY MUCH BETTER 
HEALTHCARE FOR A FRACTION OF 
THE COST. 
AND YOU CAN GO CROSS STATE 
LINES AND NEGOTIATE WITH 
EVERYBODY YOU WANT TO NEGOTIATE 
WITH. 
WE'VE INVESTED A RECORD $700 
BILLION IN OUR MILITARY. 
AND $716 BILLION NEXT YEAR, WE 
ARE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY. 
WITH THE FINEST PLANES, THE 
FINEST MISSILES, THE FINEST 
SHIPS, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 
WE HAD TO DO IT, WE HAD TO DO 
IT. 
AND THEY'RE ALL MADE IN THE 
USA. 
FOLKS, JOBS TOO. 
IN THAT CASE, MUCH LESS 
IMPORTANT, BECAUSE THERE'S 
NOTHING SO IMPORTANT AS 
PROTECTION AND OUR MILITARY. 
BUT IN THIS CASE, THE ONLY TIME 
SECONDARILY -- IT'S CALLED JOBS 
BECAUSE ALL OF THIS EQUIPMENT 
AND ALL OF THESE BRILLIANT 
PLANES THAT EVERYBODY -- THEY 
WANT TO BUY -- ALL OF THEM -- 
WE HAVE A BACKLOG -- WE MAKE 
THE GREATEST MILITARY EQUIPMENT 
IN THE WORLD, WE MAKE THE 
GREATEST JETS, WE MAKE THE 
GREATEST CHIPS, WE MAKE THE 
GREATEST MISSILES. 
WE HAVE THE ANTIMISSILE 
MISSILES THAT SHOOT DOWN 
MISSILES. 
MANY, MANY MILES AWAY IN THE 
SKY LIKE A NEEDLE IN A 
HAYSTACK. 
THEY SHOOT THEM DOWN. 
HARD TO BELIEVE. 
AND WE ARE SURROUNDING OUR 
COUNTRY WITH THEM, BY THE WAY, 
IF YOU DON'T MIND. 
REMEMBER WHEN OTHER COUNTRIES 
SAID WE DON'T WANT YOU TO PUT 
DEFENSIVE MISSILES -- IN YOUR 
COUNTRIES -- YOU DON'T WANT US 
TO POST -- EXPLAIN THAT TO ME 
PLEASE. 
REMEMBER? 
THEY USED TO GET ANGRY. 
WHEN WE WOULD PUT DEFENSIVE 
MISSILES, ANTIMISSILE MISSILES 
IN OUR COUNTRY -- SO WE 
WOULDN'T DO IT. 
NO THANKS. 
WE'LL PUT THEM IN IF YOU DON'T 
MIND. 
AND I'VE DIRECTED THE PENTAGON 
TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF 
CREATING A SIXTH BRANCH OF THE 
UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES 
CALLED THE SPACE FORCE. 
VERY IMPORTANT. 
WE JUST PASSED THE LANDMARK VA 
ACCOUNTABILITY LAW. 
NOW, IF A BAD GOVERNMENT WORKER 
MISTREATS OR NEGLECTS OR STEALS 
-- DOES ANYTHING BAD TO OUR 
GREAT VETERANS -- WE TURN TO 
THEM AND WE SAY, YOU ARE FIRED, 
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE! 
RIGHT? 
GOT TO DO IT. 
GOT TO DO IT. 
MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY -- THAT 
WAS 40 YEARS THEY TRIED TO GET 
ACCOUNTABILITY -- BUT EVEN MORE 
-- I WANTED VETERANS CHOICE. 
WHERE IF A VETERAN ISN'T 
PROPERLY SERVED -- IF THEY HAVE 
TO WAIT THREE, FOUR, FIVE 
WEEKS, CAN YOU IMAGINE 
YOURSELVES, THE DOCTOR SAYS 
THAT'S OKAY, COME BACK IN 22 
DAYS? 
PEOPLE THAT WERE NOT ILL END UP 
BEING TERMINALLY ILL BECAUSE 
THEY CAN'T SEE A DOCTOR -- SO 
WE PASSED THE -- THEY'VE BEEN 
TRYING TO PASS IT FOR 40 YEARS 
-- WE JUST PASSED -- I SANDED A 
MONTH AGO -- VETERANS CHOICE. 
WHERE OUR GREAT, GREAT VETERANS 
-- IF THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR A 
LONG PERIOD, THEY GO OUTSIDE, 
THEY GO TO A PRIVATE DOCTOR AND 
WE PAY THE BILL. 
RIGHT? 
I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES 
FROM THE HORRIBLE -- AND VERY 
EXPENSIVE -- AND A DEAL THAT 
DIDN'T WORK -- THE IRAN NUCLEAR 
DEAL. 
AND I HOPE EVERYTHING IS GOING 
TO BE FINE WITH US AND IRAN, 
BUT I WILL TELL YOU, THEY ARE A 
MUCH DIFFERENT COUNTRY THAN 
THEY WERE FOUR MONTHS AGO. 
I ALSO RECOGNIZE THE CAPITAL OF 
ISRAEL AND FIVE MONTHS LATER, 
WE OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY 
IN JERUSALEM. 
>>  
>> INSTEAD OF APOLOGIZING FOR 
AMERICA, WE ARE STANDING UP AND 
WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND WE'RE 
SAYING, WE HAVE A GREAT 
COUNTRY. 
WE DON'T APOLOGIZE ANYMORE. 
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE 
HEROES WHO DEFEND AMERICA. 
AND WE ARE PROUDLY STANDING UP 
FOR OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
>>  
>>  USA! 
USA! 
>> WITH EVERY PROMISE WE KEEP, 
EVERY RECORD WE BREAK, AND 
EVERY FACTORY WE OPEN, WE ARE 
RESTORING AMERICAN STRENGTH AND 
WE ARE RESTORING AMERICAN 
PRIDE. 
BUT TO CONTINUE THIS INCREDIBLE 
MOVEMENT, WE MUST ELECT MORE 
REPUBLICANS SO WE CAN GET THE 
VOTES THAT WE NEED TO PASS 
THESE INCREDIBLE PROGRAMS. 
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, GET YOUR 
FRIENDS -- GET YOUR NEIGHBORS --
AND GET OUT AND VOTE FOR AN 
INCREDIBLE CHAMPION AND 
INCREDIBLE WINNER. 
LOU BARLETTA. 
LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELP 
BUILD THIS COUNTRY. 
AND TOGETHER, WE ARE TAKING 
BACK OUR COUNTRY -- WE ARE 
RETURNING POWER TO WHERE IT 
BELONGS. 
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
THIS IS THE STATE WHERE OUR 
FOUNDING FATHERS DECLARED OUR 
INDEPENDENCE. 
SIGNED OUR CONSTITUTION. 
AND DEFENDED OUR GOD-GIVEN 
RIGHTS. 
PROUD PENNSYLVANIA WORKERS MINE 
THE COAL, WORK THE RAILROADS, 
AND FORGED THE STEEL THAT MADE 
AMERICA INTO THE GREATEST AND 
MOST POWERFUL NATION IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR WORLD. 
AND NOW IT'S MORE POWERFUL AND 
RICHER THAN EVER BEFORE. 
AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET 
BETTER. 
FROM VALLEY FORGE TO GETTYSBURG 
TO NORMANDY, PENNSYLVANIA 
PATRIOTS GAVE THEIR SWEAT, BLOOD
AND THEIR VERY LIVES TO PROTECT 
OUR FAMILIES, OUR FREEDOM, AND 
OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. 
>>  
>> WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF 
THESE AMERICAN PATRIOTS, WHO 
KNEW HOW TO WORK, KNEW HOW TO 
FIGHT, AND KNEW HOW
TO WIN. 
THEY KNEW HOW TO WIN. 
WITH YOUR HELP, YOUR VOICE AND 
YOUR VOTE, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP 
ON FIGHTING AND WE ARE GOING TO 
KEEP ON WINNING. 
WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH, 
PERHAPS SOME OF YOU -- BUT NOT 
ALL -- WILL GET TIRED OF 
WINNING. 
ANYBODY GOING TO GET TIRED OF 
WINNING? 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN. 
WE WILL NEVER BACK DOWN. 
AND WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING 
FOR THIS LAND THAT WE LOVE. 
>> 
>> BECAUSE WE ARE AMERICANS. 
AND OUR HEARTS BLEED RED, 
WHITE, AND BLUE. 
WE ARE ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY, 
AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER 
GOD. 
AND TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE 
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG 
AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE 
AGAIN. 
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN! 
THANK YOU, PENNSYLVANIA. 
VOTE FOR LOU. 
THANK YOU.

>> ♪ I SAW HER TODAY AT THE 
RECEPTION, A GLASS OF WINE IN 
HER HAND -- 
>> WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SPEAKING BEFORE 
A CROWD THERE, ENTHUSIASTIC 
CROWD OF SUPPORTERS IN WILKES-
BARRE, PENNSYLVANIA, A STATE 
THE PRESIDENT CARRIED IN 2016 
BY SOME 44,000 VOTES, THE 
PRESIDENT THERE TONIGHT, TO 
CAMPAIGN FOR REPUBLICAN U.S. 
SENATE CANDIDATE LOU BARLETTA. 
LET'S TURN TO OUR CBS NEWS 
CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT 
MAJOR GARRETT WHO IS THERE 
TRAVELING WITH THE PRESIDENT. 
MAJOR, THAT WAS A LENGTHY 
RALLY. 
MORE THAN AN HOUR AND 15 
MINUTES BY OUR COUNT. 
I WANT TO START WITH A QUESTION 
SOMETHING YOU SAID EARLIER THIS 
WEEK ABOUT THE
PRESIDENT'S RALLY IN FLORIDA, 
YOU SAID THAT THESE EVENTS ARE 
SOMETIMES EASY TO CHALK UP AS 
THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER 
BUTTHAT IS NOT THE CASE. 
DID YOU GET THAT SAME KIND OF 
FEELING THEIR IN PENNSYLVANIA? 
>> YES. 
ELAINE, I GOT TO TELL YOU, THE 
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN US IS 
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW. 
PROBABLY MY 80th TRUMP RALLY. 
WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT THIS 
BUILDING AND I'VE BEEN HERE 
BEFORE -- IT HAS A MASSIVE ECHO 
EFFECT. 
SO I CAN BARELY HEAR A SINGLE 
WORD YOU ARE SAYING. 
I MADE OUT ENOUGH OF WHAT YOU 
ASKED TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER. 
BUT I CAN BARELY HEAR ANYTHING 
YOU'RE SAYING TO ME. 
LET'S CARRY ON. 
SO THIS IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 
RALLY THAN THE FLORIDA RALLY. 
IN FLORIDA, DONALD TRUMP WAS 
INSERTING HIMSELF INTO A 
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY THAT IS 
CONTESTED. 
AND HE WAS MAKING HIMSELF THE 
CENTER OF AN INTRAPARTY FEUD. 
WHICH HAD ITS OWN DYNAMICS. 
HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA, THERE'S 
NOT THAT KIND OF INTRAPARTY 
FEUD GOING ON. 
AND HE IS HERE FOR LOU 
BARLETTA, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE 
RUNNING FOR SENATE AGAINST BOB 
CASEY. 
WELL ORGANIZED RALLY, LOTS OF 
LOU BARLETTA SIGNS. 
LOU BARLETTA GOT HIS TIME, AT 
THE PODIUM AS RON DeSANTIS DID, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FAVORITE 
CANDIDATE FOR THE NOMINATION IN 
FLORIDA. 
HERE, IT WAS MUCH MORE OF 
LARGER REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM, 
AND PRO-TRUMP ENTHUSIASM FOR 
SURE. 
ONE THING IS SIMILAR ABOUT THE 
RALLIES I'VE BEEN TO THIS WEEK, 
THE AUDIENCE FEELS A DEEPER 
SENSE OF SATISFACTION THAN THEY 
DID DURIN THE CAMPAIGN. 
AS THE PRESIDENT JUST SAID, I 
WAS PROMISING YOU THINGS BACK 
IN 2016 -- I'M DELIVERING ON 
THEM NOW. 
AND FOR THE CROWD THAT'S HERE, 
THAT IS A VERY POWERFUL 
COMBINATION. 
THEY BELIEVED BACK THEN, THEY 
FEEL THAT SENSE OF VINDICATION 
NOW. 
AND THE FASCINATING QUESTION 
FOR THE MIDTERM ELECTION WILL 
BE, DOES THAT SENSE OF 
VINDICATION, COMPETITIVE
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OR 
COMPETITIVE SENATE RACE 
TRANSLATE INTO SOMETHING LARGER 
THAT WE MIGHT EXPECT? 
DOES THE TRUMP EFFECT WORK DOWN 
BALLOT? 
AND THE REASON THAT'S A REALLY 
IMPORTANT QUESTION IS NOT JUST 
THE MAJORITY FOR REPUBLICANS IN 
THE HOUSE AND SENATE, BUT 
REMEMBER, IN 2016, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WON, WE ALL REMEMBER 
THAT. 
BUT IN A STATE WHERE REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS ALSO WON FREQUENTLY, 
THOSE REPUBLICAN SENATORS MARCO 
RUBIO AND FLORIDA, RON JOHNSON 
IN WISCONSIN, OTHERS, RAN AHEAD 
OF THE VOTE COUNT FOR DONALD 
TRUMP. 
SO THEY WERE OKAY BY 
THEMSELVES. 
IT WASN'T DONALD TRUMP'S 
COATTAILS THAT BROUGHT THEM 
INTO THE SENATE. 
SO IN THE MIDTERM CYCLE NOW, 
WHAT IS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE 
TRUMP EFFECT IN COMPETITIVE 
RACES, HOUSE AND SENATE, WHERE 
HE IS NOT ON THE BALLOT? 
WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT. 
BUT RALLIES LIKE THIS REMIND ME 
THAT THE TRUMP EFFECT IS STRONG,
THE TRUMP EFFECT IS REAL, AND 
PEOPLE WHO SHOW
UP AT THESE RALLIES AS I 
LEARNED IN 2015, ARE -- CAN BE 
RELIABLY EXPECTED TO SHOW UP TO 
VOTE. 
SO WE HAVE TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND 
ABOUT THE POWER OF THESE 
RALLIES, AND IF I WERE A 
DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, I WOULD 
TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THE 
PRESIDENT'S COMMITMENT TO 
CAMPAIGN FREQUENTLY. 
DURING THE MIDTERM CYCLE. 
HE IS PICKING UP THE PACE. 
AND IF HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME 
ON THE ROAD, THE TRUMP EFFECT 
COULD BE REAL AND COULD BE 
SIGNIFICANT FOR REPUBLICAN 
PROSPECTS. 
>> MAJOR GARRETT FOR US IN 
WILKES-BARRE, PENNSYLVANIA, 
THANKS FOR SOLDIERING THROUGH 
THOSE ACOUSTIC CHALLENGES. 
ONE MORE THING, GO AHEAD. 
>> YEAH. 
IT'S WILKES-BARRE. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID IT WRONG, 
IT'S WILKES-BARRE. 
HE SAID -- I USED TO SAY WILKES-
BARRE. 
BUT PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU, 
WILKES-BARRE. 
>> WE CALLED THE CHAMBER OF 
COMMERCE. 
THE PRODUCERS ARE TELLING THE 
CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE SAYS 
"WILKS BARE." 
>> THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AN 
INTERN. 
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AN INTERN. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO GET TO THE 
BOTTOM OF THIS. 
MORE TO COME, OKAY, THANK YOU 
SO MUCH, MAJOR GARRETT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
CBS NEWS, ALWAYS ON.
