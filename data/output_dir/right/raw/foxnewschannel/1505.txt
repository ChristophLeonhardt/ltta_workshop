YOU ARE CALLING IT SPYGATE.

THEY WILL SIT IN THE ROOM.

00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:19,809
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO

8
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:20,510
WORK IT OUT AMONG THEMSELVES.

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,512
WE ARE NOT UNDERCUTTING.

00:00:22,512 --> 00:00:24,080

FREE BEACON."

62
00:01:39,288 --> 00:01:41,190
STEVE, YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW THIS

63
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,259
IS COMING OUT AND SIGNIFICANCE.

64
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,862
>> IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THAT

65
00:01:45,862 --> 00:01:48,264
THE LEFT AND PARTS OF THE

66
00:01:48,264 --> 00:01:50,466
ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA,

67
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:51,100
"THE NEW YORK TIMES," WERE

68
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,535
DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF WHAT WE NOW

69
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:53,903
DESCRIBE AS A DEEP STATE.

70
00:01:53,903 --> 00:01:55,371
WE HAD JAMES CLAPPER GOING TO

71
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:57,907
CONGRESS AND LYING ABOUT

72
00:01:57,907 --> 00:01:59,876
SURVEILLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

73
00:01:59,876 --> 00:02:02,278
THERE IS A SUSPICION OF THE

74
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:02,845
SECURITY SERVICES AND

75
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:03,479
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.

76
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:04,947
NOW THAT THEY SEEM TO BE AGAINST

77
00:02:04,947 --> 00:02:06,783
ROME, WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE

78
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:11,454
THEY ARE PURE THAN PURE.

79
00:02:11,454 --> 00:02:16,125
THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE ARE

80
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,593
SUFFICIENT REASONS TO THINK THAT

81
00:02:17,593 --> 00:02:18,861
THE ESTABLISHMENT THOUGHT THAT

82
00:02:18,861 --> 00:02:21,464
THE PROSPECT OF A TRUMP

83
00:02:21,464 --> 00:02:22,498
PRESIDENCY WAS UNTHINKABLE,

84
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:23,633
UNACCEPTABLE, AND TOOK STEPS TO

85
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:25,501
TRY TO STOP IT.

86
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:26,702
THERE'S ENOUGH SUSPICION THERE

87
00:02:26,702 --> 00:02:30,173
TO THINK THAT WE REALLY DO NEED

88
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:31,140
A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THAT'S

89
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,508
EQUIVALENT TO THE INVESTIGATION

90
00:02:32,508 --> 00:02:34,010
AND RUSSIAN MEDDLING, WHICH IS

91
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,479
REALLY IMPORTANT, TO LOOK AT THE

92
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,246
POTENTIAL OF DEEP STATE

93
00:02:37,246 --> 00:02:39,615
MEDDLING.

94
00:02:39,615 --> 00:02:43,920
>> Bret: MARA, ARE YOU CALLING

95
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,687
IT SPYGATE?

96
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:46,322
THE PRESIDENT IS HAPPY THAT HE

97
00:02:46,322 --> 00:02:47,090
HAS BRANDED SOMETHING NEW.

98
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,292
HE HAS COME UP WITH SPYGATE.

99
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:50,693
HE SAID YOU ARE CALLING IT

100
00:02:50,693 --> 00:02:51,294
SPYGATE.

101
00:02:51,294 --> 00:02:52,261
EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT IT.

102
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:54,430
HE SAID IT COULD BE THE BIGGEST

103
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,531
SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

104
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:57,934
BUT HE IS TALKING ABOUT IS THAT

105
00:02:57,934 --> 00:03:00,503
THERE WAS SOMEONE, A SPY, AS HE

106
00:03:00,503 --> 00:03:02,905
CALLS IT, EMBEDDED IN HIS

107
00:03:02,905 --> 00:03:03,639
CAMPAIGN FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES

108
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,540
TO SPY ON THE CAMPAIGN.

109
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,942
SO FAR THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF

110
00:03:05,942 --> 00:03:06,242
THAT.

111
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:09,345
WE DON'T KNOW IF HE'S TALKING

112
00:03:09,345 --> 00:03:23,826
ABOUT AN FBI INFORMANT

113
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:26,129
WE DON'T KNOW IF HE'S TALKING
ABOUT AN FBI INFORMANT WHO MET

114
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:26,929
WITH CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE

115
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:27,663
CAMPAIGN, REACHED OUT TO THEM TO

116
00:03:27,663 --> 00:03:28,397
FIND OUT WHAT CONTACTS THEY HAD

117
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:28,831
WITH RUSSIANS.

118
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:29,565
BUT IF THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO,

119
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:30,266
HE CAN DECLASSIFY ANY PIECE OF

120
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:30,833
INFORMATION HE WANTS.

121
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:31,534
HE COULD HAVE ASKED ANY OF HIS

122
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:32,268
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS OVER THE

123
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:32,969
LAST COUPLE WEEKS OR MONTHS TO

124
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:33,603
SAY TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.

125
00:03:33,603 --> 00:03:34,303
WAS THERE A SPY EMBEDDED IN MY

126
00:03:34,303 --> 00:03:34,670
CAMPAIGN?

127
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,404
I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO KNOW.

128
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:36,072
I THINK HE WANTS TO KEEP THE

129
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:36,472
STORY GOING.

130
00:03:36,472 --> 00:03:37,173
IT'S A GOOD NARRATIVE FOR HIM

131
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:37,974
AND IT HELPS HIM UNDERMINE THE

132
00:03:37,974 --> 00:03:39,809
CREDIBILITY OF THE

133
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:41,410
INVESTIGATIONS INTO HIM AND HIS

134
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:41,777
CAMPAIGN.

135
00:03:41,777 --> 00:03:44,380
>> Bret: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

136
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,883
ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT, LESLIE, THE

137
00:03:46,883 --> 00:03:48,050
JARED KUSHNER GETTING SECURITY

138
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,685
CLEARANCE TODAY FINALLY AFTER A

139
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:51,988
LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

140
00:03:51,988 --> 00:03:54,824
NATIONAL SECURITY LAW ATTORNEY

141
00:03:54,824 --> 00:04:05,501
TOLD US "THIS IS A VERY

142
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:06,102
SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT.

143
00:04:06,102 --> 00:04:06,769
THE BUREAU WOULD'VE HAD VERY

144
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:07,436
SENIOR PEOPLE ON THIS IN THE

145
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:08,137
MATTER WOULD'VE BEEN REVIEWED

146
00:04:08,137 --> 00:04:08,871
AND APPROVED OF THE MOST SENIOR

147
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:09,205
LEVELS.

148
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:09,872
THIS DECISION WILL BE HIGHLY

149
00:04:09,872 --> 00:04:10,439
VETTED AND CONSIDERED.

150
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,107
THEY WOULDN'T BE DEEMING HIM

151
00:04:11,107 --> 00:04:11,707
ELIGIBLE FOR ACCESS TO

CLASSIFIED MATERIALS NO MATTER

WHAT LEVEL OF CLEARANCE IF THERE

WERE ANY OUTSTANDING

00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:16,946
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CONCERNS

156

WHATSOEVER."

157
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:23,486
ONE PERSON'S ASSESSMENT.

158
00:04:23,486 --> 00:04:24,086
YOUR THOUGHTS.

159
00:04:24,086 --> 00:04:25,855
>> I DON'T THINK JARED KUSHNER

160
00:04:25,855 --> 00:04:26,722
IS THE PROBLEM.

161
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:28,191
I THINK THE PRESIDENT AND HIS

162
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:29,292
RHETORIC ARE THE PROBLEM AND

163
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:30,593
IT'S CAUSED A PROBLEM NOT ONLY

164
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:33,095
FOR HIS SON-IN-LAW BUT THAT

165
00:04:33,095 --> 00:04:34,630
TENSION WE HAVE SEEN WITH THE

166
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,132
RHETORIC TOWARD THE FBI AND

167
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:37,733
OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

168
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:38,501
THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING

169
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:44,106
FOR OUR COUNTRY AND FOR THE

170
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:45,007
CONSTITUTION.

171
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:46,475
WHEN WE GO BACK TO MARA'S

172
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:48,511
POINTS, WHEN YOU CALL THE

173
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,912
SPYGATE, AND I'M NOT CALLING IT

174
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:50,346
SPYGATE.

175
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:52,014
I WANT TO GO ON THE RECORD.

176
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:53,416
>> Bret: I DON'T THINK WE HAVE

177
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:59,355
CALLED IT SPYGATE.

178
00:04:59,355 --> 00:05:01,791
>> LET'S SPEAK ABOUT SPYGATE, IF

179
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:02,391
WE WILL.

180
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:05,428
THE RULE OF THE FBI, ANYBODY,

181
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:07,096
EVEN IF THEY WORKED FOR

182
00:05:07,096 --> 00:05:07,763
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS, THIS

183
00:05:07,763 --> 00:05:09,332
GENTLEMAN ALL THE WAY BACK TO

00:05:09,332 --> 00:05:11,300
RONALD REAGAN, IS TO DO EXACTLY

185
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,802
THIS BREEDS TO SAY THERE'VE BEEN

186
00:05:12,802 --> 00:05:13,436
SOME CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN

187
00:05:13,436 --> 00:05:14,937
RUSSIA AND THOSE IN THE

188
00:05:14,937 --> 00:05:15,905
UNITED STATES.

189
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:17,139
PAUL MANAFORT HAS BEEN INDICTED.

190
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:18,374
PAUL MANAFORT IS ONE OF THE

191
00:05:18,374 --> 00:05:20,109
PEOPLE WHO WERE SPOKEN TO AND TO

192
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:21,811
MARA'S POINT, THE PRESIDENT HAS

193
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:24,847
THE POWER TO FIND OUT IF THERE

194
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:26,315
WAS A SPY EMBEDDED, IF THERE

195
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:27,717
TRULY WAS SPYGATE.

196
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:28,951
THIS IS DEFLECTION.

197
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:30,386
WHY DEFLECT FROM THE MUELLER

198
00:05:30,386 --> 00:05:31,320
SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION IF

199
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,455
THERE IS NOTHING TO HIDE.

200
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:35,691
>> Bret: BOTH THINGS ARE GOING

201
00:05:35,691 --> 00:05:36,025
FORWARD.

202
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:36,892
WE ALWAYS SAY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

203
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:37,793
WE DON'T KNOW BUT WE ARE

204
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:38,694
COVERING BOTH SIDES.

205
00:05:38,694 --> 00:05:39,895
THE REASON I BRING UP THE JARED

206
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:42,465
KUSHNER THING IS HOW THAT WAS

207
00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:43,933
COVERED EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS

208
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:46,068
SUGGESTED THAT BECAUSE OF ALL

209
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:49,071
THE FOREIGN CONTACTS AND ALL THE

210
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:50,306
QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED ABOUT

211
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:51,073
JARED KUSHNER THAT THERE WAS NO

212
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:53,509
WAY HE WAS GOING TO GET SECURITY

213
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:55,077
CLEARANCE AND SOMEHOW HE COULD

214
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:55,678
BE CHARGED OR INDICTED.

215
00:05:55,678 --> 00:05:59,448
THAT WAS THE COVERAGE AND THE

216
00:05:59,448 --> 00:05:59,849
SPECULATION.

217
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:03,319
NOW HE'S CLEARED.

218
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,354
>> AS A FORMER OFFICIAL TOLD

219
00:06:05,354 --> 00:06:07,290
CATHERINE HERRIDGE IN HER

220
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,592
REPORT, THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT

221
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:10,226
THOSE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

222
00:06:10,226 --> 00:06:12,261
CONCERNS NO LONGER EXIST.

223
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:14,297
IF HE HAD BEEN GRANTED THE

224
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:16,065
SECURITY CLEARANCE.

225
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:20,303
I LIKE TO QUOTE DONALD RUMSFELD.

226
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:22,805
THERE ARE SO MANY KNOWN

227
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:23,306
UNKNOWNS.

228
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:24,940
THE INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN

229
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,142
INTERFERENCE IN THE

230
00:06:26,142 --> 00:06:27,276
INVESTIGATION OF THE

231
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:28,477
INVESTIGATION.

232
00:06:28,477 --> 00:06:29,445
COMING FROM CONGRESS AS MUCH AS

233
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:30,813
DONALD TRUMP IS PUBLICIZING IT

234
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:32,415
AND AIDING IT, THERE ARE A LOT

235
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:33,215
OF CONCERNS FROM THE HOUSE

236
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,551
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ABOUT HOW

237
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:36,285
DID THIS START.

238
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:38,888
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT

239
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:39,889
UNKNOWNS.

240
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:41,657
ONE OF THE GREAT KNOWN UNKNOWNS,

241
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:42,058
RATHER.

242
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:45,361
WHILE HE WAS THE ORIGINAL ORDER

243
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:47,263
THAT DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL

244
00:06:47,263 --> 00:06:48,497
ROSENSTEIN GAVE TO ROBERT

245
00:06:48,497 --> 00:06:48,898
MUELLER?

246
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:52,201
WE DON'T KNOW THE FULL DETAILS.

247
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:56,405
WE ALSO DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS

248
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:57,873
OTHER BRITISH PROFESSOR WHO MET

249
00:06:57,873 --> 00:06:59,075
WITH GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS.

250
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:02,078
HE HASN'T BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC IN

251
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:02,678
MONTHS.

252
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:05,247
THE KNOWN UNKNOWNS CONTINUE TO

253
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:06,182
MOUNT.

254
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:07,483
>> Bret: MARA, WHERE DO YOU

255
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:09,752
THINK THIS GOES?

256
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:11,487
>> I DON'T KNOW.

257
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:13,189
WE KNOW WHAT RUDY GIULIANI SAYS,

258
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:15,091
THAT IT WILL BE DONE BY

259
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:15,624
SEPTEMBER.

260
00:07:15,624 --> 00:07:16,692
MUELLER WILL BE DONE BY

261
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:17,293
SEPTEMBER.

262
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:18,928
THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERY TWIST

263
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:20,930
AND TURN, WE DON'T KNOW THE BIG

264
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,931
PICTURE.

265
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:23,132
BOB MUELLER ISN'T TALKING, TO

266
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:23,532
HIS CREDIT.

267
00:07:23,532 --> 00:07:25,668
WE ARE COVERING THIS THROUGH A

268
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:26,435
STRAW AND EVERYTHING SEEMS LIKE

269
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:27,770
THE BIGGEST DEAL.

270
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,739
I WOULD SAY THE BOTTOM LINE TO

271
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:31,307
ME FOR TODAY FOR JARED KUSHNER,

272
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:32,708
THIS WAS A GOOD DAY FOR JARED

273
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,143
KUSHNER AND A GOOD WEEK FOR

274
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,910
JARED KUSHNER BECAUSE HE STARTED

275
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,880
WORKING ON A SUBSTANTIVE POLICY

276
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,915
THAT HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN

277
00:07:39,915 --> 00:00:00,000
CONGRESS COMMAND THAT HIS PRISON
