Russia has chosen the Assad regime again over the unity of this council it's a travesty they have now officially vetoed resolutions that would hold these barbaric uses of chemical weapons attacks by Assad six times history will record that history will work will record that on this day Russia chose protecting a monster over the lives of the Syrian people that was ambassador nikki Haley responding to Russia's sixth veto of a UN resolution regarding serious use of chemical weapons it comes as NBC News has learned that Russia has been jamming the GPS systems of some US military drones in Syria according to four US officials that has seriously affected American military operations in the country joe do you think that the UN ambassador statements will have an impact I think they do have an impact they certainly have an impact around the United Nations and are hurt across the globe i you know mica you never know how governors are going to make the transition from running a state government to being thrust under the international stage you and I heard some very unkind things from inside the Trump White House early on that suggesting from national security staff that she may not be up to the job it seems to me it's just the opposite is the case nikki Haley has been doing a extraordinary job at the United Nations and Richard Haas it seems to me that nikki Haley also at the United Nations has promoted American values as well as any UN Ambassador we could hope to have and seems to me that despite what the commander-in-chief is saying in the White House at least in New York at the UN nikki Haley seems to be fighting to continue down the path of more traditional u.s. foreign policy post-war foreign policy what are your thoughts about the job she's doing there at least in the words that she's saying in condemning these heinous acts well she's been very tough on Russia as as we heard she's been effective at getting new sanctions against North Korea she's been you know strongly defending of Israel but going back to Micah's question you know will this have impact on Russian behavior visa vie Syria the short answer is no that's also probably an unfair test for the u.s. permanent representative at the United Nations that's too much to ask but Russia's clearly unconditionally siding with Bashar al-assad and it's going he'll talk about a later expecto but it's going to significantly complicate US military planning and this is part of a larger narrative where Vladimir Putin's Russia is essentially saying in every way he can in every language he can that we are not part of quote unquote the West or the international community we are pursuing our own narrow national interest as we see it in Ukraine in Syria using cyber and essentially we don't care what you say we don't care what you think we don't care what you do with sanctions or anything else Russia is an outlier it's that simple so if you're drawing up a plan for the president if you're talking to James Madison Bolton or anybody on the president's national security team what is the best step forward to put Russia back on their heels in Syria I think the best step forward we took the other day with these very significant economic sanctions and I would continue to do that because that's an area where Russia can't respond there's no symmetry that's available to them as opposed to for example kicking out diplomats which is a big mistake but I think the in Syria of what it does is it means you've got to think twice or three times before ever using US aircraft because that you can't now discount the possibility of Russian defensive reactions and you've got the complications against drones or even cruise missiles it just complicates what it is you're going to do coming back to the conversation you and I had earlier this week what it does is it raises the importance not simply of how we respond in a punitive way but it raises the question of what we do going forward and I think the most significant thing we do in Syria is we find a way to keep those few thousand US troops in an open-ended way and we work more closely than ever before with the Syrian Kurds to help them and we look for ways to help the Syrian people so we don't just think about a short-term punitive response we think about a long-term response that affects the future of Syria with Vladimir Putin and Russia in the Middle East for the first time since 1973 1974 is there any option for the United States to remove those 2,000 troops out or would it be catastrophic and would it be seeding that entire region to Russia to Iran to Isis Assad to actually are three or four greatest enemies on the globe it would not just be a moral stain on the United States probably more than anything else this this would then become the equivalent of Barack Obama's redline if right now Donald Trump after everything that's happened after everything he said after everything he's tweeted after everything the Russians the Syrians the Iranians have done if he were to take US forces out people would be it would be fair to say this is his redline moment he is blinked and the United States cannot be taken seriously in the Middle East joining us now the author of the report on the Russians jamming us GPS NBC News national security and military reporter Courtney Kubek Courtney good morning good to see you let's pick up this conversation here about Syria you have Russia saying we've gone in and checked there were no chemical weapons used in that attack that killed at least 60 people that's the Russian and Syrian position they've said if the United States launches missiles at Syria those missiles will be intercepted and the source of those missiles will be attacked by Russian forces so with all this in play what is the White House what is the Defense Department considering in terms of response to the alleged chemical attack in Syria so there's several different options that are on the table one of them of course is similar to what we saw last April in 2017 after the devastating first chemical weapons attack when the u.s. launched about 60 tomahawks in that was really more of a strike that was to send a message to the Assad regime the US was saying we know where this strike this this attack came from we know what aircraft carried it out they popped up the runways but it didn't really have a big operational or practical impact on the ground or in the Syrian militaries operations another option would be something slightly more aggressive the US officials that I've been speaking with seem to think that this is where this international response is going to fall is some sort of a slightly larger response more broader response which would include you know other US allies being involved it would include probably going after maybe some some Bashar al-assad command and control so something that would actually have more of an impact than then halting operations at one Syrian military base for one day which is what we saw in April of 2017 and then of course the most aggressive option would be for the United States and France Britain whatever countries were willing to go in on this to actually go after not just Syrian military but Iranian and even Russian military targets now we've seen some pretty aggressive language out of the Russian military when they talk about going after the u.s. any kind of a US asset that would be responsible for this they're talking about US military ships in the Med they're talking about potentially US military aircraft that is very aggressive language and it is something that the Russians can actually back up with action they have an of an advanced anti-air defense system it's called the s400 it's sitting on top of a mountain in Aleppo and it is it's an integrated air defense system that is integrated with with both Russian and Syrian military all over the country so they can actually take out an aircraft or cruise missile that's coming into the country pretty reliably if they wanted to that's exactly what they've threatened to do and as you said go after the source of those missiles the ships you're talking about NBC's Courtney Kuby great reporting here thanks so much real quick Richard as you listen to those options laid out is there a concern about a confrontation with Russia and Iran there's so much in the stew in Syria its concern about that there's also concerns about getting drawn into the mire that the muck that is that is the Syrian civil war and it's one of the reasons that people ought to be really careful about taking and making getting rid of Assad or even weakening him but what she what Courtney just laid out is the the paucity of US options there's punitive options that even twice what we de left so we shoot off a hundred cruise missiles but so what a week later two weeks later Syria's back in business they want to use chemicals again they will there's not a great target set there's the risk you talk about again it's why I keep saying don't just think punitive ly think long term think about ways we can make a difference in the long-term future of Syria forces on the ground against terrorists things to help the Syrian people that may not be as dramatic but it may be more significant all right coming up a warning about fascism former Secretary of State
