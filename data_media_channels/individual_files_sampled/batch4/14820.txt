I want to talk about Memorial Day and the freedoms we Americans take for granted now to me and to many many other Americans room Oriole Day is much more than just a long weekend time for us to honor those who have paid the ultimate price for this nation and really those killed in action and their families the gold star families I have a routine on Memorial Day on that Monday this morning that I do every year at the end of the street where I live there's an old cemetery one of the oldest in South Florida and there are many graves of veterans the most interesting one to me is sergeant Edgar broads of the 8th I Oh infantry he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions the Battle of Spanish for it Alabama April 8th in 1865 1865 in the Civil War there are the graves of World War one Airmen some of the first pilots ever served this nature and it's a really uh for me anyway special way to honor their service and sacrifice while at the same time absorbing some really interesting history but one of the things that strikes me heavy every year is is what they died for now sergeant bras fortunately died in old age he didn't pass away until 1923 many of the others were killed in action many of the others whose headstones are in that cemetery were killed in action and they were very young they were very young they're in their 20s they're in their 30s thumb in their late teens from World War one and you remember what they or you should remember and like I said the gold star families as well their families you should remember what they sacrificed for and one of those most basic sacrifices or a bill of rights they died defending this nation protecting preserving and defending our Constitution the First Amendment of our Constitution which gives us the right as Americans to say what we want to say as long as we're not threatening someone or screaming fire in a crowded movie theater you know the old the old cliche except it's lives at risk that's not true around the world and over the last few days something incredibly disturbing has happened to one of our former colleagues here at the rebels still a good friend of the rebel Tommy Robinson over in the UK and you've probably seen the story by now it's the lead on Drudge now I took a step back initially I wanted to gather all the information so I called some law enforcement folks over in the United Kingdom I spoke with others who are familiar with the situation and I don't use this term lightly and you watch the show you watch me you listen to me you know that I'm not a conspiracy theorist I'm not wanting to throw terms around gratuitously I truly in my heart of hearts believe that Tommy is now a political prisoner I truly in my heart of hearts believe reading all of the information speaking to law enforcement I trust in the United Kingdom speaking to people who know Tommy those who've researched the issue alongside me from both sides people over in Europe in the UK some friends in Canada others here in the States there is no other explanation now if you don't know what happened Tommy has been excuse me incredibly successful at exposing Muslim rape gangs most notably the Muslim paedophile gang in the United Kingdom and many other places in Europe as well but because he's based in the UK he has been very successful at exposing them and it has really drawn the ire of liberal politicians in that nation but Tommy had a suspended sentence for filming in Canterbury a Muslim rape gang trial he was set up on the steps of the courthouse but he was the only journalist others were as well but he was the only journalist penalized for now in this most recent case the one that happened just a few days ago he followed all the rules he was not impeding or or or biasing the trial these defendants were going into a verdict hearing they were gonna found out they were found guilty it apparently was a bench hearing meaning there was only a judge who was already inside the building and could see Tommy through the window so he wasn't prejudicing a jury that was walking in with his questions and his camera he stayed off the courthouse steps and these are violent radical Muslim rape gangs they raped children 11 12 13 14 hundreds maybe thousands of kids collectively in the UK these various gangs these are heinous people these are terrible people and for profiling them Tommy Robinson was arrested by the police now that's bad enough Americans look at that with horror and say a journalist arrested or reporting on a relevant case but it's worse the judge the judge removed he revoked Tommy suspended sentence and sentenced him 13 months in jail over a year in jail is terrifying it is chilling it should scare everyone it is disgraceful worse than that the judge has now made it illegal to even speak about Tommy's case in the UK and this judge Jeffrey Markson Marcin Jeffrey Marcin might have sentenced Tommy to death because the Muslim gangs that run many of these prisons are much like the Mexican Mafia in our prisons on the west coast or some of the violent gangs and the prisons on the East Coast they run these prisons Tommy runs the risk he runs the risk of being murdered in jail his judge didn't care now I want to read the names I want to read the names of the people that Tommy profiled Amir saying Dhaliwal accused of 54 charges including 21 charges of rape and 14 of trafficking if Ron ahmud nine offences including child pornography Zahid Hasan 20 offences six include raping a girl 13 or under Mohammed comer who offenses rape of a girl under 15 Mohammed

Jana's Malik one count of neglecting a child this is a ring of savages of savages they should be put down like rabid dogs but instead this judge this judge Jeffrey Marcin wanted to protect apparently their identities and dignity even though their identities had already been released by the BBC haami did nothing that was not already in the public domain nothing this case is absolutely disgraceful Connie Robinson can very easily be killed in jail this should send chills down the spine of every person on this planet who who loves freedom and who believes in freedom of the press there is no other way to see this this is political persecution because Tommy Robinson dared report about Muslim rape gangs he named names he showed faces to protect people and he is being politically persecuted by the radical suicidal are left in Great Britain but what can you do how can you help yet loud get loud tweet it Facebook it blog it comment on it get as loud as possible and let's keep this story alive till Tommy is released from jail this is terribly terribly important content what happened to Tommy Robinson good chance could send chills down the spine like I said of every freedom-loving person around the world everyone who believes in a free press this is a disgrace this is a travesty I'm gonna bring you every update on this story Tommy is a good guy I like Tommy's controversial we love controversy controversy is what gives us good information I'm gonna bring you every detail on this story help me do that by subscribing to our premium service at www.mediaed.org this
