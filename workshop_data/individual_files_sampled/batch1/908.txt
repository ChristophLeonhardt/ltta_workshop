when it comes to speed skating nobody does it better Dutch the Netherlands medal tally at the last Winter Olympics was the best by any nation in any single sport in the history of the games and put them fifth in the overall table despite not winning any medals outside of skating it has left rivals Norway the US and Canada desperately trying to catch up before Pyeongchang 2018 sure you know if you should get beat like that that doesn't feel good for anybody we're trying to to always keep step ahead of the rest of the world and that's it so sometimes pretty difficult because you know everybody learns everybody learns from mistakes and it's so important here and and it's so deep in into the culture everybody grows up with speaking especially when there's natural ice and frozen outside and everybody starts getting crazy so I think that's a most the biggest reason why we have success in speed skaters are professional stars in the Netherlands the work that makes them champions is done here at the TF Arena in the small town of Herrin vane famed as the fastest ice in the world it's home to pensioners and schoolchildren at the same time as world champions but the success of the sport has its roots in the Dutch landscape the Dutch have been getting their skates on for centuries as the many canals here froze over in winter this is the traditional finish of the elf stayed and talked a 200 kilometer race across the frozen waterways of Friesland it's not been cold enough to hold it for 20 years now making it something that haunts some Dutch dreams even more than Olympic gold if you win that race you will be a legend in Holland it's it's incredible how many people are watching that race and it's even bigger than the Olympics I guess the Netherlands has dozens of professional skaters with this single team presentation including several potential Olympic champions a show of power United with tradition that could be impossible to resist in Pyeongchang Paul Reis al-jazeera here in vain
