so CNN has consistently been questioning progressives Alexandria concierge Cortez in particular about her programs to help American people that's obviously an outrage if you do tax cuts for the rich to the tune of trillions of dollars well of course we can afford to add wards for trillions of dollars well of course we can afford that but you want to help somebody get health care in America we're gonna pay for it so in fact let me just show you a couple of quick clips here we did this earlier with Jake Tapper crystalisses on a follow-up that I want to share with you guys then we'll comment on but I want to show you the tone of tappers questioning and the substance of it as well so we already sure shared with you across your Cortazar responses in an earlier clip so this is just as a warm-up to solicit let's remind you tappers questions let's watch according to a nonpartisan and left-leaning studies friendly to your cause including the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities or the Tax Policy Center the overall price tag is more than 40 trillion dollars in the next decade you recently said in an interview that increasing taxes on the very wealthy plus an increased corporate tax rate would make 2 trillion dollars over the next ten years so where's the other 38 trillion dollars going to come from so as we explained to you earlier that is greatly misleading first of all he said from left-leaning think tanks yes some of the smaller numbers the 32 trillion dollar number which I think is the the great majority of the 40 trillion if I can do my math right I'm pretty sure I can comes from the coke funded study at George Washington University but he made it seem like oh no these are all liberal think tanks that are coming out with it but more important than that is we've got now over several times that 32 trillion dollar number is does not exist on its own that is the cost of health care in the country and so every proposal would counter that we would take away some percentage of that money now progressives have shown and we've shown on this program over and over again even that Koch funded study shows you if you actually applied Medicare for all as it currently exists it would save us 34 trillion dollars that's the thing that Jake Tapper left out so that would be a net two trillion dollars in savings and instead of talking about this monstrous 40 trillion dollar number we'd be talking about obviously a much smaller number six trillion but even if you thought hey you know what it's not going to save us two trillion it's gonna cost us two trillion and that's what the Conservatives might argue well you're still not talking about 40 trillion dollars you're talking about 10 trillion at that point so the whole thing is grossly misleading and Alexandria concert Cortes countered by hey Healthcare actually the medicare-for-all proposal saves money a very similar 2.4 the one I'm making right now but tapper was not convinced and at the end of the interview he ended it this way to me I'm not going to get an answer for the other 38 trillion dollars ok I'm not sure that you wanted that answer and but still CNN persists so crystal is a apparently progressives responses to this i don't know if it got under his skin or they just love this topic so much because they can't wait to show that they are not liberal media by beating up on progressives and and of course it depends on whether you're right or not so facts do matter so let me quote quotes ELISA here he said on Sunday CNN's Jake Tapper put a very simple question to Alexandria Ocasio gore does how are you planning to pay for the many and various expensive programs and plans that you're either proposing or support the New York soon-to-be congresswoman didn't have any answers like none he said but wait a minute Chris she explained for three minutes on how Medicare for all would save money now I guess you're hanging your hat on well she didn't go through the math that Jake Tapper presented let us know it and we looked into this and we asked CNN about it we asked some of the groups that they cited is there does this number exist anywhere else the 40 trillion dollar number that tapper asked her about right there and no it appears that it's CNN's math they took a number of studies and put them together so the reason why that's important is because this is the first time Alexandria crosser Cortes or anyone has ever heard of that number so you couldn't simply prepared ahead of time for this question so then they say okay here's 40 trillion dollars I put it up in a graphic which you might or might not be able to see as a guest and I need you to answer right away she gives the best answer she can wait a minute the 32 trillion dollar number actually is not accurate because Medicare for all which save us money and they go like none like none that's not true because you're not paying attention because you don't want to pay attention so I he goes on he says let's buy into across your core test case that cost would shrink if the government rather than the free market ran things pause there to note that apparently she did have an answer okay not none so apparently you acknowledge that he goes on to say let's even say that it would have the cost of the programs that she supports making the law that's still 20 trillion dollars which is coming which has to come from somewhere right no Chris Chris look it's incredible how smug they are and how condescending they are when they are preposterous ly wrong why would you have the number that doesn't make any sense have to des a combination of college for all Medicare for all and a number of different programs it's a weird thing to say let's have the number no if you took out Medicare for all taking out the 32 trillion dollars you're having a completely different conversation and by the way as tapper pointed out in the beginning across your Cortes has said first if you take away the Trump tax cuz that's another two trillion dollars if you do the speculation tax that's another two trillion dollars and so on and on next you know there's actually very little to make up if you had to quote-unquote make up anything and I can get to the substance of the how they're thinking about it wrong in a second but their math is preposterous ly wrong but yet the condescending is whereas we made up a bunch of numbers and then we made up having them and that we claim that you don't have an answer for things that we made up out of whole cloth so let me give you the rest and I want everybody to jump in he goes on to say the truth at a concert Cortes doesn't want to acknowledge is that the only or at least the most likely way that she fills the gap between cost savings of the actual cost of the programs she's proposing is to raise taxes YES on the wealthy but also for being honest on more than just the wealthy raising taxes is never popular no correction Chris it is actually quite popular among the American people if you actually looked at the polling but you don't instead you're in groupthink and in Washington my Republican friends told me raising taxes now bar Bueller all my rich friends told me that raising taxes is not popular look at a poll Chris it actually is popular these tax cuts were they cut taxes to the tune of two trillion dollars at one point I think pulled it 17% have you ever looked at any polling so I'm sorry if I'm being condescending but I believe you started it okay tapper is doing important he says I love this one tapper is doing an important public service here solisten says well why we really appreciate it he's highlighting the difference between campaigning and governing the truth is that as a candidate you can be for almost anything because you don't have any responsibilities you aren't in charge of managing the federal budget or reducing our deficit and debt obligations free stuff sounds great but free stuff is almost never free oh look at the condensation dripping as well yes yes Oh free stuff isn't free unless we're giving it to the rich and then all of a sudden trillions of dollars materialize out of nowhere and he concludes with as Jake's interview made very very clear Ocasio Cortes isn't there yet and by the way that's just a little bit of sexism sprinkled in there like Oh cassia Cortes young woman doesn't understand how to have n ages of perhaps etcetera doesn't know how to govern but the most important thing if you put those sexism ageism etc side is progressive but Chris Jake did you guys for one second ever considered how we're governing today and I don't mean just under Donald Trump I mean under your beloved establishment under your beloved status quo it's been an absolute disaster epic deficit after deficit under Republicans and Democrats and in the tax cuts in the wars and spending and all those things that never got us any of the results that they promised do you remember that the Bush administration and congressional hearings said that the Iraq war would cost 1.7 million dollars instead it cost several trillion dollars and did you ever ask them how dare you you obviously don't know how to govern look at these children in the Bush administration child Dick Cheney doesn't know how to govern a foolish John Bolton doesn't understand anything about money did you ever put up a graphic and say John Bolton where's the money where's the money where's the trillions of dollars you wasted no never because you assume the status quo is a great thing whereas the rest of the country does not we think the status quo is a disaster well I mean I think you look obviously going back to the the skyrocketing skyrocketing costs of the war effort and you know a rock in Afghanistan that that's certainly true but we don't even need to go back that far I mean they just passed a defense budget this week 673 billion dollars that's never expressed in the same way you know what does that actually mean over the course of a decade well we assume if it doesn't go up and of course it always goes up that that's six point seven trillion dollars right there how we're gonna afford it some of my favorite free stuff is military stuff but free stuff isn't free so how are we gonna afford that they would never ask that question of anyone democrat or republican Lib or conservative because with certain types of programs the assumption is that the value is there if they say we need 700 billion dollars in the actual budget not you know including continuing expenses and things like Syria obviously we need that we need to have military defense budget levels that are similar to under Vietnam even though we're not in a war or even close to comparable if they do the tax cuts the assumption is that the value is there the Republicans always say that if you cut taxes that will actually generate more government revenue so they just assume that that is the case I didn't hear him going through that list of the programs under the GSA as he was labeling it and talking about all the benefits of that if you cut these student loans what do you think happens to the money that the people would have been spending on their loans they'll be spending it on other things which not only stimulates the economy produces more government revenue we know that on the on the opposite way when you cut people's taxes people who are already making millions or potentially more each year they're not then plowing that saved money back into you know Starbucks and buying cars they're generally putting the money offshore so they've got it exactly twisted Jake Tapper could take that same sort of condescending attitude and make a great career out of applying that same sort of rigorous standard hopefully attached to the facts to every politician that comes before him but he of course will not do that he will do that with libs and probably just young latina female libs like Alexandria caster Cortes he will never take that tone with Steve King or did anyone like that Mick Mulvaney Paul Ryan tax cuts all these things that happen they'll criticize Donald Trump the too much smog who's not ready for primetime the guy for the entire election talked about all the promises you can make promises when you're a live he brought up of course he brought up a long with Alexandria Koster Cortes he also brought up Andrew Gilliam just I don't know it just sides to that name in there too because you know all these guys who were new to the scene police in your mind it's like he hasn't been do anything in Tallahassee for all these years it's just that oh you just heard their name - it means they don't know what they're doing of course yes there's criticism for Donald Trump for his craziness his over-the-top rhetoric and way he talks and responses always all but he's he's connecting with the people it's okay to connect with the people know the country that you're staying in the heartland of the country but not for the people who she's in New York somebody's in California all those crazy libs all they want is handouts when you see a rich person getting handouts which they did and then it all gets siphoned out we had Tara fights where people are losing jobs I remember he was at Trump was promising carrier jobs harley-davidsons losing he doesn't know how these things work they'll point out that that's happening but they then won't say and why should we trust him with anything else they'll just say hey what crazy with that the next step is the next thing he says is gonna screw you over - they'll say that here because I'm telling you there's something deep down and it happens with liberals and Jake Tapper's pretty good on a lot of socially progressive things I think from what I've seen but there's still something inside beautiful a lot of liberals that they see a young woman a young minority of either gender and they'll go I just I can't see her making legislation that I have to follow it doesn't feel good to them there's still something that paid up some people's stomachs they don't like seeing that face do something for the country that they have to then follow there might be a thing on women and mouths - I mean I'm I I have a degree in math I've got a graduate degree in statistics I am I want to talk a little bit about you know some of the things you mentioned about how we can dig into what Jake Tapper didn't do and think about how this really benefits the economy whatever the cost is because a cost is also a reallocation that's what happened when for example the Fed created out of nowhere four and a half trillion dollars to give to the US banking system to allow them to be prosperous instead of say taking a third of that 1.4 trillion which is a correct number on tappers list and using it to defuse the student debt so that when students actually graduate they can go ahead and pay for things and not have to pay for all their debt similar with health care right now and that's I think where this number came from we pay as Americans three point four trillion dollars a year in health care so what the basic study that Tapper chose to use in that interview said okay well ten times that's thirty four trillion so that's the number which has nothing to do with anything first of all that is the number that includes increases Hospital cost increases in premiums it doesn't look at more importantly the deflection of any money whatever the right number is from paying premiums and paying additional health care and paying from other things that could go into the economy into preserving one's life or or one's health for example right now the average family in the United States pays about eight thousand dollars a year in health care cost five thousand dollars sometimes per individual if you told everyone you're getting a five thousand or eight thousand dollar tax cut in other words we are reappropriation your pockets so that you can you put that into the economy that looks like a really great game and that is a much smaller game than the one and a half trillion dollars of tax cuts they went to corporations who only pay for nine percent of the federal budget so all of how we should be looking at the essence of what Alexandria said and why Bernie Sanders says and what progressives say which is that we need to choose how we grow our economy do we our grow our economy by funding stuff that doesn't go into the economy but makes GDP look better or do we fund the economy by taking things into the economy that can allow its citizens to be healthier and citizens to be more productive economically and raise GDP nowhere in any of the conversations that attack what progressives want to do with their spending indicates the increase that happens on the other side of reallocating funds away from helping those that don't need it and re attributing that to people who can use it into the real economy whether that is after school whether that is instead of health care costs whether that's to grow businesses whatever that might be raised GDP actually inflate the economy so that as a country we're not paying 17 percent of GDP in health care costs versus 9 percent in almost every other developed country almost more than basically double but we're actually increasing GDP and reducing health care costs so that we are healthier as a nation and for people so I want to make one final comment about their view of the status quo and and look I agree with jr. that that they're probably socially liberal I you know and I've credited Jake Tapper in the past for some good segments and we try to be fair here you know here I'll try even more here look I think you guys make might make some good points that I mentioned it to about you know is that their age is it is it that they're new onto the scene it's that I think it's mainly to this is an ironic way of being fair to them but their disdain for progressives in general because they have show the same disdain to Bernie Sanders and so and he's in obviously a different category and so but in their world view these guys are all outsiders and now don't know how to govern they've thought about of Bernie Sanders that way for the last 40 years to them he seems like a radical for proposing things that in almost every issue about 60% or higher of Americans agree with it is not a radical position again I asked you to look at the polling I asked you that from the outside because you almost never invite us on the inside so sometimes you'll talk to Bernie Sanders you did a three minute segment with Alexandria Koster cortes and then you follow with like progressives can never answer the questions that's because you don't ask them you ambush her with a made-up number and then never followed up with any other progressive other than to keep pounding that they can't answer they can't answer it what you don't actually have him on air look at the answer no me just cape she's a former managing director of Goldman Sachs has written a number of best-selling books about these issues I think there's plenty of progressives to choose from but somehow CNN never gets them on air there's wall-to-wall Trump people there's wall-to-wall Clinton people but when it comes to progressives no your ambush on for three minutes and then make fun of them for a week afterwards and don't let them defend themselves but and maybe their look again I guess I'm gonna sound a little condescending here but two can play at this game maybe they're afraid of the answer that if we came out there and we made these points they'd like whoa that's smooth we don't talk about that on there so for example jr. alluded to you know with progresses they're always saying oh you want free stuff you want free stuff that's a Republican talking point Oh welfare the welfare queens want stuff but hey how come you guys almost never talk about corporate welfare and an amazing study between 2010 and 2015 but the the 200 top companies who gave money to politicians gape and astounding 5.8 billion dollars but you know where they received in return four point four trillion dollars in subsidies what was your graphing about that all right you're a multi-billion dollar corporation so maybe that's what makes you uncomfortable but and a lot of those people advertised on your air list keep it real and maybe that's why you don't want progressives on air but the reality is that there if there is welfare in this country people who want free stuff its corporate welfare and they robbed us to the tune of trillions of dollars so you'll excuse us that when someone proposes to spend money on the American people that we get excited by that because for the first time it would be our representatives representing us rather than their corporate donors two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT
