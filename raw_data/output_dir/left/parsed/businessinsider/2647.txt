in the challenging these mountains were
very difficult because we didn't work in
this barren in this type of environment
before we have to climb the mountains
because we got a drill a lot of holes so
there was no access road so it was very
difficult for us but I began we have an
excellent product on the extremely site
this prayer in this project we not only
use the type of technology in cables and
equipment also we use also the top
people in order to build this because
not many people had the experience of
building this type of cables in the
world so we bought people from Paree
coaches are also very experts and also
people from Costa Rica to build this to
ensure we have the safest product and
the longest zipline in the world
