The disappearance of
Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi
made international headlines.
“The mystery deepens
tonight over the fate
of Jamal Khashoggi.
Did the Saudi royal family
have him murdered?”
News outlets from Saudi Arabia
broadcast their own theories
of what they say
really happened.
Khashoggi is a former adviser
to senior Saudi officials.
He moved to
the U.S. last year
and has been working
as a columnist
for The Washington Post.
“We in Saudi Arabia had
about 10,000 royalties
who were acting around us
like little kings.”
He’s recently been critical
of the Saudi government.
Turkish authorities say
Khashoggi was killed
by a team of 15 men,
who arrived
in Istanbul on private jets
from Saudi Arabia.
The Saudi government has
denied any involvement.
But here’s the story
Saudi media is telling:
This segment says the team
of 15 men from Saudi Arabia
were simply tourists,
not killers.
In this segment,
the anchors applaud a tweet
that implies the
Turkish media is spreading
false information about
the jet allegedly used
to fly the Saudi hitmen.
The theory revolves around
a picture of the jet
that the TV commentators
agree is suspicious.
But the picture is actually
a generic stock image
photographed at
least two years earlier.
One popular theory is that
Qatar, a neighboring arrival
of Saudi Arabia, is spreading
the narrative that the
Saudi royal family had
Khashoggi killed.
This theory is pervasive
in Saudi media.
Al Riyadh, a prominent
pro-government daily newspaper,
ran this op-ed on
its front page.
This headline reads:
The Qatari media fails again
in the Khashoggi
disappearance case.
But what really happened to
Khashoggi remains a mystery.
