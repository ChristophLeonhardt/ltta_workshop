>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, MEMBERS OF
THE CABINET, HONORED GUESTS, AND
FELLOW AMERICANS, IT IS MY
PRIVILEGE TO ADDRESS YOU TONIGHT
FROM THE EAST ROOM OF THE WHITE
HOUSE.
WE'RE GATHERED TOGETHER THIS
EVENING FOR A TRULY MOMENTOUS
OCCASION.
I HAVE LONG BEEN TOLD THAT THE
MOST IMPORTANT DECISION A
PRESIDENT CAN MAKE IS THE
APPOINTMENT OF A SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE.
WELL, IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS, WE
WILL PROUDLY SWEAR IN THE NEWEST
MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT, JUSTICE BRETT
KAVANAUGH.
JOINING US FOR TONIGHT'S
CEREMONY IS EVERY SITTING
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, THANK
YOU.
JUSTICE THOMAS, THANK YOU.
JUSTICE GINSBURG, THANK YOU.
JUSTICE BRIAR, THANK YOU
JUSTICE.
JUSTICE ALITO.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, THANK YOU.
JUSTICE KAGAN, THANK YOU.
AND JUSTICE GORSUCH.
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEND OUR
DEEP APPRECIATION TO MAUREEN
SCALIA, THE WIFE OF THE LATE,
GREAT ANTONIN SCALIA -- AN TO
ANYONE SCALIA, AND ALSO TO OUR
WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL, DON McGAHN.
THANK YOU, DON.
THANK YOU.
WE ARE THRILLED TO BE JOINED
THIS EVENING BY JUSTICE ANTHONY
KENNEDY.
JUSTICE KENNEDY, AMERICA OWES
YOU A PROFOUND DEBT OF GRATITUDE
FOR A LIFETIME OF NOBLE SERVICE
TO OUR NATION.
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
THANK YOU.
VERY SPECIAL AND TREASURED
GUESTS TONIGHT ARE JUSTICE
KAVANAUGH'S AMAZING WIFE,
ASHLEY.
THANK YOU, ASHLEY.
AND THEIR TWO BEAUTIFUL
DAUGHTERS, MARGARET AND LIZA.
AND WE ARE ALSO JOINED BY
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH'S MOM AND DAD,
MARTHA AND ED.
THANK YOU.
I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN TONIGHT'S
PROCEEDING DIFFERENTLY THAN
PERHAPS ANY OTHER EVENT OF SUCH
MAGNITUDE.
ON BEHALF OF OUR NATION, I WANT
TO APOLOGIZE TO BRETT AND THE
ENTIRE KAVANAUGH FAMILY FOR THE
TERRIBLE PAIN AND SUFFERING YOU
HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ENDURE.
THOSE WHO STEP FORWARD TO SERVE
OUR COUNTRY DESERVE A FAIR AND
DIGNIFIED EVALUATION, NOT A
CAMPAIGN OF POLITICAL AND
PERSONAL DESTRUCTION BASED ON
LIES AND DECEPTION.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE KAVANAUGH
FAMILY VIOLATES EVERY NOTION OF
FAIRNESS, DECENCY, AND DUE
PROCESS.
OUR COUNTRY, MAN OR A WOMAN,
MUST ALWAYS BE PRESUMED INNOCENT
UNLESS AND UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.
AND WITH THAT I MUST STATE THAT
YOU, SIR, UNDER HISTORIC
SCRUTINY WERE PROVEN INNOCENT.
THANK YOU.
MARGARET AND LIZA, YOUR FATHER
IS A GREAT MAN.
HE IS A MAN OF DECENCY,
CHARACTER, KINDNESS, AND COURAGE
WHO HAS DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO
SERVING HIS FELLOW CITIZENS.
AND NOW FROM THE BENCH OF OUR
NATION'S HIGHEST COURT, YOUR
FATHER WILL DEFEND THE ETERNAL
RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF ALL
AMERICANS.
YOU KNOW THAT.
WE ARE JOINED TONIGHT BY A
LEADER WHO HAS NEVER WAVERED IN
HIS SUPPORT AND DEVOTION TO THE
RULE OF LAW AND TO BRETT
KAVANAUGH'S ELEVATION.
HE'S WORKED VERY VERY HARD AND
HE TRULY HAS DONE JUST AN
INCREDIBLE AND WONDERFUL JOB FOR
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, MAJORITY
LEADER MITCH McCONNELL.
THANK YOU, MITCH.
PLEASE, STAND UP UP.
I THINK THAT'S A BIGGEST HAND
HE'S EVER RECEIVED.
THEY DON'T GET IT, MITCH.
YOU'RE GREAT, THANK YOU.
VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT.
I'D LIKE TO THANK ANOTHER MAN
WHOSE PRINCIPLED LEADERSHIP HAS
EARNED WIDESPREAD ADMIRATION.
CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE, SENATOR CHUCK
GRASSLEY, THANK YOU CHUCK.
WE ARE GREATFUL TO ALL OF THE --
GRATEFUL TO ALL OF THE SENATORS
ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHO
FOUGHT SO HARD FOR THIS
CONFIRMATION.
ENATORS LINDSEY GRAHAM, JOHN
CORNEN, ORRIN HATCH, MIKE LEE,
TED CRUZ, BEN SASSE, JEFF FLAKE,
MIKE CRAPO, THOM TILLIS, AND
ON-KENNEDY -- AND JOHN KENNEDY.
THANK YOU.
AND THANK YOU ALSO TO ROB
PORTMAN, SITTING RIGHT HERE.
THANK YOU ROB PORTMAN.
AND FINALLY WE ARE INDEBTED TO
SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS FOR HER
BRAVE AND ELOQUENT SPEECH, AND
HER DECLARATION THAT WHEN
PASSIONS ARE MOST ENFLAMED,
FAIRNESS IS MOST IN JEOPARDY.
HOW TRUE, HOW TRUE.
HOW TRUE.
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS A MAN OF
OUTSTANDING INTELLECT, A
BRILLIANT SCHOLAR, AND HIS
CREDENTIALS ARE UNSURPASSED.
A GRADUATE OF BOTH YALE COLLEGE
AND YALE LAW SCHOOL HE HAS
TAUGHT AT HARVARD, YALE, AND
GEORGETOWN.
WHEN HE'S NOT WORKING OR WITH
HIS FAMILY, HE'S GIVING BACK TO
HIS COMMUNITY.
HE SPENT 26 YEARS IN PUBLIC
SERVICE AND JUST LIKE JUSTICE
GORSUCH HE CLERKED FOR JUSTICE
KENNEDY.
FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS, BRETT WAS
A JUDGE ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT
COURT OF APPEALS, WIDELY
REGARDED AS OUR NATION'S SECOND
HIGHEST COURT.
DURING HIS TENURE HE AUTHORED
OVER 300 OPINIONS DISTINGUISHED
BY THEIR MASTERFUL AND IMPARTIAL
REASONING.
KNOWN AS A JUDGE'S JUDGE, HE IS
A FAIR MINDED, UNBIASSED, AND
EVEN HANDED PERSON.
HE UNDERSTANDS THAT JUSTICE MUST
BE DIVORCED FROM THE PASSIONS OF
THE DAY, TETHERED INSTEAD TO THE
ENDURING FOUNDATION OF OUR
REPUBLIC, THE CONSTITUTION.
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH FILLS THE
PLACE LEFT BY ANTHONY KENNEDY.
SOON JUSTICE KENNEDY WILL
ADMINISTER THE JUDICIAL OATH TO
BRETT KAVANAUGH JUST AS HE DID
LAST YEAR FOR JUSTICE GORSUCH.
THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME A
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE HAS EVER
SWORN IN A FORMER CLERK TO TAKE
HIS SEAT.
A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT WHICH REMINDS
US THAT FREEDOM IS A TRADITION
PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO
GENERATION.
THAT'S A BIG STATEMENT.
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT
SO MUCH.
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
SO BEAUTIFUL.
SO BEAUTIFUL.
NARG RET AND LIZA'S PRESENCE --
MARGARET AND LIZA'S PRESENCE
TONIGHT REMINDS US WHAT HIS
HISTORIC EVENT, ALL ABOUT YOUR
FATHER, IS ALL ABOUT.
IT'S ABOUT WHAT KIND OF A NATION
WE'RE GOING TO BE AND WHAT KIND
OF A COUNTRY OUR CHILDREN WILL
INHERIT.
IT IS UP TO EACH OF US AND TO
ALL AMERICANS WATCHING TONIGHT
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
IT IS UP TO US TO RECLAIM OUR
HERITAGE OF EQUAL AND IMPARTIAL
JUSTICE.
IT IS UP TO US TO REDEDICATE
OURSELVES TO THE TRADITIONS AND
WISDOM OF OUR FOUNDERS.
AND IT IS UP TO US TO RENEW THE
BONDS OF LOVE, LOYALTY, AND
AFFECTION THAT LINK US ALL
TOGETHER AS ONE GREAT AMERICAN
FAMILY.
LET US PRAY WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN
THIS TASK, AND LET US PRAY THAT
ALL OF AMERICA'S CHILDREN WILL
GROW UP IN A COUNTRY THAT IS
FAIR AND JUST AND SAFE AND
STRONG AND FREE.
AND LET US ASK GOD TO BLESS
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY
AS THEY EMBARK ON THIS
INCREDIBLE JOURNEY TOGETHER.
I NOW INVITE JUSTICE BRETT
KAVANAUGH TO COME FORWARD AND TO
TAKE THE JUDICIAL OATH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> JUSTICE KAVANAUGH ARE YOU
READY TO TAKE THE OATH OF
OFFICE?
>> I AM.
>> REPEAT AFTER ME.
I BRETT M. KAVANAUGH DO SOLEMNLY
SWEAR.
>> I BRETT M. KAVANAUGH DO
SOLEMNLY SWEAR.
>> THAT I WILL --
>> AND GIVE EQUAL RIGHT TO THE
POOR AND TO THE RICH.
>> AND GIVE EQUAL RIGHT TO THE
POOR AND TO THE RICH.
>> AND THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY
AND IMPARTIALLY.
>> AND THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY
AND IMPARTIALLY.
>> DISCHARGE AND TEMPER.
>>--
AND PERFORM.
>> DISCHARGE AND PERFORM.
>> ALL THE DUTIES INCUMBENT UPON
ME.
>> ALL THE DUTIES INCUMBENT UPON
ME.
>> AS ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
>> AS ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
>> UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND
THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES.
>> UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND
LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES.
>> SO HELP ME GOD.
>> SO HELP ME GOD.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU FOR
THE GREAT HONOR OF APPOINTING ME
TO SERVE AS A JUSTICE OF THE
SUPREME COURT.
I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND YOUR DEEP
APPRECIATION FOR THE VITAL ROLE
OF THE AMERICAN JUDICIARY.
I AM GRATEFUL FOR YOUR
STEADFAST, UNWAVERERING SUPPORT
THROUGHOUT THIS PRO-- UNWAVERING
SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS.
AND I'M GRATEFUL TO YOU AND
MRS. TRUMP FOR THE EXCEPTIONAL
OVERWHELMING COURTESY YOU HAVE
EXTENDED TO MY FAMILY AND ME.
MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU FOR
EVERYTHING.
I AM HONORED TO SERVE ON A
SUPREME COURT HEADED BY CHIEF
JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS IS A
PRINCIPLED, INDEPENDENT, AND
INSPIRING LEADER FOR THE
AMERICAN JUDICIARY.
AS A COUNTRY, WE ARE FORTUNATE
TO HAVE JOHN ROBERTS AS CHIEF
JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES.
I'M HONORED TO SERVE ALONGSIDE
ALL OF MY NEW COLLEAGUES, EACH
OF WHOM I KNOW, AND EACH OF WHOM
I GREATLY ADMIRE AND DEEPLY
RESPECT.
ALL NINE OF US REVERE THE
CONSTITUTION.
ARTICLE THREE OF THE
CONSTITUTION PROVIDES THAT THE
JUDICIAL POWER SHALL BE VESTED
IN ONE SUPREME COURT.
THE SUPREME COURT IS AN
INSTITUTION OF LAW.
IT IS NOT A PARTISAN OR
POLITICAL INSTITUTION.
THE JUSTICES DO NOT SIT ON
OPPOSITE SIDES OF AN AISLE.
WE DO NOT CAUCUS IN SEPARATE
ROOMS.
THE SUPREME COURT IS A TEAM OF
NINE.
AND I WILL ALWAYS BE A TEAM
PLAYER ON THE TEAM OF NINE.
AS A NEW JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME
COURT I UNDERSTAND THE
RESPONSIBILITY THAT I BEAR.
SOME 30 YEARS AGO STANDING HERE
IN THE EAST ROOM WITH PRESIDENT
REAGAN ANTHONY KENNEDY TOOK THE
OATH TO BE A NEW JUSTICE OF THE
SUPREME COURT.
JUSTICE KENNEDY BECAME ONE OF
THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL JUSTICES
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
I SERVED AS JUSTICE KENNEDY'S
LAW CLERK IN 1993.
TO ME, JUSTICE KENNEDY IS A
MENTOR, A FRIEND, AND A HERO.
ON THE SUPREME COURT HE WAS A
MODEL OF CIVILITY AND
COLLEGIALITY.
HE FIERCELY DEFENDED THE
INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY
AND SEL LOUSILY -- ZEALOUSLY
GUARDED THE INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES
SECURED BY THE CONSTITUTION.
JUSTICE KENNEDY ESTABLISHED A
LEGACY OF LIBERTY FOR OURSELVES
AND OUR POSTERITY.
I WILL ALWAYS BE HUMBLED AND
PROUD TO SIT IN JUSTICE
KENNEDY'S SEAT ON THE SUPREME
COURT.
I THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE
UNITED STATES SENATE.
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH
McCONNELL FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND
STEADY RESOLVE.
I THANK JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
CHAIRMAN CHUCK GRASSLEY FOR
WISDOM.
THEY'RE A CREDIT TO THE COUNTRY
AND TO THE SENATE.
I'LL BE FOREVER GRATEFUL TO EACH
OF THEM AND TO ALL THE SENATORS
WHO CAREFULLY CONSIDERED MY
NOMINATION.
PRESIDING OVER THE FINAL VOTE IN
THE SENATE ON SATURDAY WAS VICE
PRESIDENT PENCE.
I'M GRATEFUL TO THE VICE
PRESIDENT FOR HIS SOUND ADVICE
AND FAITHFUL SUPPORT.
I THANK COUNSEL TO THE
PRESIDENT, DON McGAHN, WHO WAS A
WARRIOR FOR FAIRNESS AND
PERFORMED HIS CRITICAL DUTIES IN
THE FINEST TRADITIONS OF OUR
CONSTITUTION.
I THANK ALL THE OUTSTANDING
PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, AND THE
SENATE WHO WORKED DAY AND NIGHT
ON THIS NOMINATION.
ONE OF A FEDERAL JUDGE'S MOST
IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITIES 1 TO
HIRE FOUR NEW LAW CLERKS EACH
YEAR.
THEY WORK IN THE JUDGE'S
CHAMBERS FOR ONE YEAR.
THEY'RE AMONG THE BEST AND
BRIGHTEST YOUNG LAWYERS IN
AMERICA.
AND THEY BECOME THE FUTURE
LEADERS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION.
I THANK MY FORMER LAW CLERKS WHO
DEVOTED SO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY
TO SUPPORT ME DURING THE
CONFIRMATION PROCESS.
INSPIRED BY MY MOM WHO WAS A
TRAILBLAZER FOR WOMEN IN THE LAW
I'VE WORKED HARD THROUGHOUT MY
CAREER TO PROMOTE THE
ADVANCEMENT OF WOMEN.
WOMEN STILL FACE MANY BARRIERS
IN THE AMERICAN WORKPLACE, AND
ALL OF US HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM.
DURING MY 12 YEARS ON THE D.C.
CIRCUIT, A MAJORITY OF MY LAW
CLERKS WERE WOMEN.
AND ALMOST ALL OF THEM WENT ON
TO CLERK AT THE SUPREME COURT.
A CLERKSHIP ON THE SUPREME COURT
IS ONE OF THE MOST COVETED
ACHIEVEMENTS AND CREDENTIALS IN
AMERICAN LAW.
I'M PROUD THAT ALL FOUR OF MY
NEWLY HIRED LAW CLERKS AT THE
SUPREME COURT ARE WOMEN, A FIRST
IN THE HISTORY OF THE SUPREME
COURT.
TONIGHT I THANK ALL MY FRIENDS.
SO MANY AMAZING AND FEARLESS
FRIENDS FROM MY HIGH SCHOOL
DAYS, COLLEGE, LAW SCHOOL,
CLERKING, THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE
INCLUDING PRESIDENT GEORGE W.
BUSH.
FROM THE JUDICIARY TEACHING,
COACHING, PLAYING SPORTS, THE
VIBRANT, LOYAL, AND TIGHT KNIT
CATHOLIC COMMUNITY HERE IN THE
D.C. AREA AND SO MANY OTHERS.
ASHLEY AND I ARE GRATEFUL FOR
THEIR PRAYERS AND FOR THE
PRAYERS FROM THE THOUSANDS AND
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WE'VE HEARD
FROM THROUGHOUT AMERICA.
WHEN I GIVE ADVICE TO YOUNG
PEOPLE OR SPEAK TO STUDENTS I
TELL THEM CHERISH YOUR FRIENDS,
LOOK OUT FOR YOUR FRIENDS, LIFT
UP YOUR FRIENDS, LOVE YOUR
FRIENDS.
I LOVE ALL MY FRIENDS.
I THANK MY FAMILY, MY MOM MARTHA
AND MY DAD ED ARE HERE.
I'M THEIR ONLY CHILD.
MY MOM WAS ONE OF MARYLAND'S
EARLIEST WOMEN PROSECUTORS AND
TRIAL JUDGES.
MY DAD TAUGHT ME HIS WORK ETHIC
AND LOVE OF SPORTS.
THEY'VE GIVEN ME A LIFETIME OF
LOVE AND I'M FOREVER GRATEFUL TO
THEM.
MY DAUGHTERS, MARGARET AND LIZA,
ARE SMART, STRONG, AWESOME
GIRLS.
THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF FALL
LACROSSE, LOOKING FORWARD TO THE
UPCOMING BASKETBALL SEASON.
I THANK THEIR TEACHERS FOR
GIVING THEM THE DAY OFF TOMORROW
SO THAT THEY CAN COME WATCH TWO
CASES BEING ARGUED AS THE
SUPREME COURT.
MY WIFE, ASHLEY, IS A PROUD WEST
TEXAN FROM ABILENE, TEXAS.
GRADUATE OF UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS
AT AUTS TIN.
-- AUSTIN.
SHE'S THE DEDICATED TOWN MANAGER
OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY.
SHE'S GOT A DEEP FAITH, SHE'S AN
AWESOME MOM, A GREAT WIFE.
SHE IS A ROCK.
I THANK GOD EVERY DAY FOR ASHLEY
AND MY FAMILY.
THE SENATE CONFIRMATION PROCESS
WAS CONTENTIOUS AND EMOTIONAL.
THAT PROCESS IS OVER.
MY FOCUS NOW IS TO BE THE BEST
JUSTICE I CAN BE.
I TAKE THIS OFFICE WITH
GRATITUDE AND NO BITTERNESS.
ON THE SUPREME COURT I WILL SEEK
TO BE A FORCE FOR STABILITY AND
UNITY.
MY GOAL IS TO BE A GREAT JUSTICE
FOR ALL AMES AND FOR ALL OF
-- FOR ALL AMERICANS AND FOR ALL
OF AMERICA.
I WILL WORK VERY HARD TO ACHIEVE
THAT GOAL.
I WAS NOT APPOINTED TO SERVE ONE
PARTY OR ONE INTEREST, BUT TO
SERVE ONE NATION.
AMERICA'S CONSTITUTION AND LAWS
PROTECT EVERY PERSON OF EVERY
BELIEF AND EVERY BACKGROUND.
EVERY LITIGANT IN THE SUPREME
COURT CAN BE ASSURED THAT I WILL
LISTEN TO THEIR ARGUMENTS WITH
RESPECT AND AN OPEN MIND.
EVERY AMERICAN CAN BE ASSURED
THAT I'LL BE AN INDEPENDENT AND
IMPARTIAL JUSTICE DEVOTED TO
EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW.
ALTHOUGH THE SENATE CONFIRMATION
PROCESS TESTED ME AS IT HAS
TESTED OTHERS, IT DID NOT CHANGE
ME.
MY APPROACH TO JUDGING REMAINS
THE SAME.
A GOOD JUDGE MUST BE AN UMPIRE.
A NEUTRAL AND IMPARTIAL DECIDER
WHO FAVORS NO LITIGANT OR
POLICY.
A JUDGE MUST BE INDEPENDENT AND
MUST INTERPRET THE LAW NOT MAKE
THE LAW.
A JUDGE MUST INTERPRET STATUTES
AS WRITTEN, AND A JUDGE MUST
INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION AS
WRITTEN, INFORMED BY HISTORY AND
TRADITION AND PRECEDENT.
IN THE WAKE OF THE SENATE
CONFIRMATION PROCESS MY APPROACH
TO LIFE ALSO REMAINS THE SAME.
I WILL CONTINUE TO HEED THE
MESSAGE OF MATTHEW 25.
I WILL CONTINUE TO VOLUNTEER TO
SERVE THE LEAST FORTUNATE AMONG
US.
I WILL CONTINUE TO COACH, TEACH,
AND TUTOR.
I WILL CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO BE
A GOOD FRIEND, COLLEAGUE,
HUSBAND, AND DAD.
AS THIS THE PAST, OUR NATION
TODAY FACES CHALLENGES
DIVISIONS, BUT I AM AN OPTIMIST.
I LIVE ON THE SUNRISE SIDE OF
THE MOUNTAIN.
I SEE THE DAY THAT IS COMING,
NOT THE DAY THAT HAS GONE.
I AM OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE
OF AMERICA AND THE FUTURE OF OUR
INDEPENDET JUDICIARY.
THE CROWN JEWEL OF OUR
CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC AS A
JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME COURT I
WILL ALWAYS STRIVE TO PRESERVE
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
STATES AND THE AMERICAN RULE OF
LAW.
THANK YOU ALL.
>> BRETT KAVANAUGH AND THE WHITE
HOUSE TRY TO PUT A PERIOD ON THE
SENTENCE AFTER THE MOST
TUMULTUOUS MONTH OF HIS LIFE
CERTAINLY, SWORN IN AS THE 114TH
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ABOUT
THREE MONTHS AFTER HE WAS
NOMINATED IN THAT SAME SPACE BY
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
AND A LOT TO TALK ABOUT ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT EAST ROOM
OF THE WHITE HOUSE.
WE SEE RUTH BADER GINSBURG
THERE.
SHE WAS THE ONLY OF THE EIGHT
JUSTICES THERE TO WATCH THE
CEREMONY WHO DID NOT CLAP WHEN
KAVANAUGH CAME OUT.
WE SEE CLARENCE THOMAS WITH A
BIG HUG THERE.
THE OTHER LIBERAL, STEVEN BRIAR,
SONIA SOTOMAYOR, ELENA KAGAN,
THEY ALL CLAPPED.
AND THEN THE PRESIDENT GAVE A
PRETTY FIERY SPEECH FOR THE
OCCASION CALLING WHAT'S HAPPENED
IN RECENT WEEKS THE POLITICS OF
PERSONAL DESTRUCTION AND SAYING
KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN PROVEN
INNOCENT.
THE JUSTICE HIMSELF, THOESHGS
TOOK A MORE -- HIMSELF, THOUGH,
TOOK A MORE CONCILIATORY TONE.
HE PLANS TO BE A TEAM PLAYER,
AND INSISTING, I THOUGHT
NOTABLY, THAT THIS PROCESS
DIDN'T CHANGE ME.
HE SAID I FINISH IT WITH NO
BITTERNESS AND A PROMISE TO BE A
JUSTICE WHO WILL FOCUS ON THE
STABILITY AND UNITY OF THE
COURT.
CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS IS HERE WITH
ME AT THE DESK, CAITLIN, A LOT
TO DIG THROUGH IN THIS LAST HALF
HOUR.
IF WE CAN STEP BACK.
MY GOODNESS, TWO AND A HALF
YEARS AGO MERRICK GARLAND
NOMINATED AS A JUSTICE,
DEMOCRATS AND LIBERALS READY TO
TAKE CONTROL, AND NOW TWO AND A
HALF YEARS LATER A MASSIVE
VICTORY FOR THE CONSERVATIVE
MOVEMENT.
>> THEY HAVE TWO SUPREME COURT
JUSTICES, AND ESPECIALLY WITH
THIS SEAT REPLACING KENNEDY WHO
WAS CONSIDERED THE SWING SEAT ON
THIS COURT, THERE IS A LOT OF
CRITICISM FROM DEMOCRATS THAT
THIS WILL MOVE THE COURT TO THE
RIGHT.
WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING 1
THAT KAVANAUGH SPOKE AND THAT --
WAS THAT KAVANAUGH SPOKE AND
THAT HE TRIED TO HIT TWO POINTS.
HE TRIED TO STRIKE THAT
CONCILIATORY TONE AND MAKE IT
CLEAR THAT HE WANTS TO BE
BIPARTISAN, NONPARTISAN, THAT HE
TAKES THIS JOB AS A JUDGE
SERIOUSLY.
REMEMBER, DURING HIS
CONFIRMATION HEARING, DURING THE
TESTIMONY, AFTER THE TESTIMONY
FROM CHRISTNE BLASEY FORD THERE
WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM OF THE
WAY IN WHICH HE HANDLED THAT,
THAT HE EXPRESSED ANGER, THERE
WERE QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT HIS
TEMPERAMENT AND FITNESS FOR THE
COURT.
HE IS TRYING TO KIND OF SMOOTH
THAT OVER HERE.
HE ALSO TALKED A LOT ABOUT
WOMEN.
OF COURSE, THAT IS THE BIGGEST
PART OF THIS STORY.
HE SAID THAT HE HAS PICKED FOUR
WOMEN TO CLERK FOR HIM WHICH
WOULD BE HISTORY MAKING FOR THE
COURT.
AND HE VERY MUCH PLAYED THAT UP
INTO THE SPEECH.
SO TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD FROM
WHAT HAS BEEN A CONTENTIOUS
BATTLE IN TERMS OF THE
CONFIRMATION FIGHT, BUT ALSO HAS
TO KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT WILL CONTINUE TO LINGER.
WE'RE HEADING INTO A MIDTERM
ELECTION YEAR.
THESE EMOTIONS AND THE REACTION
TO THIS VERY -- STILL VERY RAW
AND A LOT OF FOLKS HAVING VERY
MICKED REACTIONS.
>> KATIE WATSON IS CBS WHITE
HOUSE REPORTER FOR CBS.COM.
I'VE RARELY HEARD THAT ROOM SO
RA KOUS.
PAINT IS -- RAUCOUS.
>> PAINT THE SCENE.
>> WHEN SENATE MAJORITY LEADER
MITCH McCONNELL WALKED IN, THERE
WAS A STANDING OVATION.
THIS WAS SEEN AS A HUGE VICTORY
FOR REPUBLICANS AND THE
PRESIDENT AFTER THIS UNDENIABLY
CONTENTIOUS LAST FEW WEEKS.
SO I WOULD SAY THERE'S AN AIR OF
CELEBRATION AT THE WHITE HOUSE
AS THE PRESIDENT'S SECOND
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE WAS
CELEBRATED AND CONFIRMED AND
SWORN IN FOR A SECOND TIME.
>> THE PRESIDENT MADE IT
POLITICAL TONIGHT SO I FEEL OKAY
TURNING TO POLITICS SO QUICKLY
AFTER THE SWEARING IN CEREMONY.
DESPITE SO MANY PEOPLE FEELING
SO BAD ABOUT THIS PROCESS,
REPUBLICANS, INCLUDING MITCH
McCONNELL, HAVE SUGGESTED
RECENTLY THIS COULD BE GOOD IN
THE MIDTERMS.
WHY DO THEY THINK SO?
>> YEAH, CERTAINLY.
WELL, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAS
CALLED IT A RALLYING CRY FOR THE
GOP.
I THINK THAT REPUBLICANS AHEAD
OF THIS ELECTION HAVE BEEN A
LITTLE BIT LUKE WAURM, IF YOU
WILL -- LUKEWARM, IF YOU WILL.
BUT MANY REPUBLICANS THAT I'VE
SPOKEN TO SAID THIS KAVANAUGH --
ENTIRE KAVANAUGH SITUATION HAS
REALLY RILED UP THE BASE AND
GIVEN THEM AN ISSUE THAT THEY
CAN SURROUND THEMSELVES AROUND
AND REALLY, AS THE PRESIDENT PUT
IT, BECOME A RALLYING CRY FOR
THE BASE FOR MANY.
SO WE'RE JUST A FEW WEEKS OUT
FROM THE MIDTERMS, OF COURSE.
WE'LL SEE IF THAT MOMENTUM
HOLDS, BUT IT'S ONE OF THE FEW
THINGS THE GOP FEELS THEY CAN
HOLD ON TO RIGHT NOW.
>> THE OTHER THING IT'S DONE IS
COALESCED A FRACTURED REPUBLICAN
PARTY.
ALL THESE NEVER TRUMP PERS, WHEN
IT WAS A CON -- TRUMPER, WHEN IT
WAS A CONSERVATIVE NOMINEE, YOU
SAW A CONSENSUS AROUND
REPUBLICANS AND CONSERVATIVES WE
HAVEN'T SEEN IN A COUPLE YEARS.
WE SAW KAVANAUGH NAME CHECK
GEORGE W. BUSH IN WHOSE WHITE
HOUSE HE WORKED FOR.
AND THOUGH THE PRESIDENT MAY
HAVE SMIRKED A BIT, THE ROOM
APPLAUDED.
WERE THERE ANY SIGNS IN THE ROOM
OF THESE TWO PARTS 06 THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY BEING IN -- OF
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BEING IN
THE SAME SPACE AND FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN A LONG TIME BEING ON THE
SAME PAGE.
>> I WOULD SAY NOT TONIGHT.
THERE WAS AN AIR OF YOUTUBETY
THROUGHOUT THE -- UNITY
THROUGHOUT THE ROOM.
IT WAS FASCINATING TO SEE ALL
NOW NINE OF THE CURRENT SUPREME
COURT JUSTICES IN THE ROOM AT
THE SAME TIME.
I WAS TRYING TO GET A READ ON
THEIR REACTIONS FROM THE ANGLE
WHERE I WAS AT.
THEY WERE, YOU KNOW, PRETTY -- I
WOULDN'T SAY STONE FACED, BUT
VERY MUCH RESPECTFUL, LOOKING
ON, EVEN OF THE ONES WHO WILL
PROBABLY DISAGREE WITH KAVANAUGH
ON THE COURT.
BUT AS FAR AS THE INDIVIDUALS
WERE HERE, IT WAS CERTAINLY MANY
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HELPED GET
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED OR HAVE
TALKED HIM UP ON FOX NEWS.
SO AROUND THE ROOM I WOULD SAY
CERTAINLY WHILE THERE WERE SOME
ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS WHO
MAY NOT HAVE ALWAYS OR MAY NOT
ALWAYS BE IN LINE WITH THE
PRESIDENT ON EVERYTHING,
EVERYONE WAS UNIFIED TONIGHT,
BROOK.
>> YEAH, I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU
SAW OF THE OTHER EIGHT.
THEY WERE IN OUR SHOT ONLY AT
THE BEGINNING.
I SAW ONE CUTAWAY WHERE STEVEN
BRIAR SEEMED TO CHUCKLE AT A
JOKE.
BUT IT WAS HARD TO GET A LOOK AT
THE OTHER JUSTICES.
FROM WHAT WE SAW, RUTH BADER
GINSBURG SEEMED NOT TO APPLAUD
WHEN KAVANAUGH CAME OUT.
DID ANY OF THEM GO UP TO
KAVANAUGH AT THE END?
I DON'T THINK THEY HAD A CHANCE.
WHAT DID YOU SEE?
>> SURE.
THAT REACTION OR LACK THEREOF I
GUESS FROM RUTH BADER GINSBURG
WAS PROBABLY THE MOST TELLING
MOMENT, THE MOST INTERESTING
RESPONSE FOR THE MOST PART AT
LEAST FROM THE ANGLE WHERE I WAS
WHERE I COULD SEE A HANDFUL OF
THE JUSTICES.
THEY WERE ALL VERY MUCH JUST
LOOKING ON RESPECTFUL AND
KAVANAUGH HIMSELF SAID THAT, YOU
KNOW, HEY, THIS IS A TEAM.
THIS IS A TEAM OF NINE.
HE RECOGNIZED THAT IT WAS A
CONTENTIOUS PROCESS.
HE DIDN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT THE
ALLEGATIONS ALTHOUGH THE
PRESIDENT TOUCHED ON THEM.
BUT HE SAID KAVANAUGH REALLY
TRIED TO MAKE THE CASE TONIGHT
THAT, HEY, I KNOW IT'S BEEN A
LITTLE BIT OF A CONTENTIOUS
PROCESS BUT I AM A TEAM PLAYER.
I'M GOING TO BE AN IMPARTIAL
JUDGE.
SO IT WAS AN AIR OF UNITY AND AT
LEAST ONE OF RESPECT FROM THE
JUSTICES AND THE ONES WHO MAY
NOT AGREE WITH KAVANAUGH ON
EVERY DECISION OR AGREE WITH THE
PROCESS.
>> CAITLIN, HERE AT THE DESK,
WHAT ELSE STRUCK YOU ABOUT THIS
AND HOW IT ENDS WHAT'S BEEN AN
INCREDIBLY CONTENTIOUS CHAPTER
IN THAT TOWN AND THIS COUNTRY.
>> WELL, THEY ARE CERTAINLY
TRYING 20 CLOSE THIS CHAPTER.
WE'RE -- TO CLOSE THAT CHAPTER.
WE'RE IN A MIDTERM ELECTION
SEASON.
THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK BOTH
PARTIES WILL HARP ON.
KATIE BROUGHT UP A GOOD POINT
WHICH IS THAT THIS HAS BEEN A
RALLYING CRY FOR THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY AND SOMETHING THAT HAS
COALESCED THE REPUBLICANS AROUND
DONALD TRUMP.
AND IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THEY
HOPE TO KEEP UP OVER THE NEXT
COUPLE OF WEEKS.
THAT COULD BE DIFFICULT TO DO.
WE'LL SEE IF THEY CAN DO THAT.
MEANWHILE, DEMOCRATS STILL FEEL
BURNED BY THIS.
AND THEY STILL FEEL ENERGIZED BY
THE RESPONSE, THE NEGATIVE
RESPONSE TO KAVA.
>> THEIR BASE HAS TO BE
ENERGIZED BY THIS.
>> EXACTLY.
WE SEE THAT REPUBLICANS TEND TO
TURN OUT FOR THE POSSIBILITY TO
SHAPE THE MAKEUP OF THE COURTS,
NOT ONLY THE SUPREME COURT BUT
JUDGESHIPS AROUND THE COUNTRY.
NOW WE'RE STARTING TO SEE
DEMOCRATS SAY WE NEED TO GET
INVOLVED IN THAT FIGHT.
WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE TO COME
OUT AND VOTE IN ORDER TO SHAPE
THE COURTS.
THAT HASN'T BEEN SOMETHING
THAT'S WORKED FOR THEM IN THE
PAST.
WE'LL SEE IF IT STARTS TO BE
DIFFERENT THIS TIME AROUND.
AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF
ELECTIONS HAVING CONSEQUENCES.
AND I THINK THAT WILL BE THE
MESSAGE COMING FROM DEMOCRATS
BUT ALSO COMING FROM
REPUBLICANS.
I THINK YOU'LL HEAR THEM SAY THE
SAME TUNE.
KIND OF TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH
THIS REALLY MATTERS.
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL BE PART
OF THIS FIRST EVER ORAL
ARGUMENTS TOMORROW MORNING.
A CASE ON WHAT CONSTITUTES A
VIOLENT FELONY.
IT BEGIN FOR HIM.
CAITLIN WATSON AND CAITLIN
HUEY-BURNS WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR
TIME.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK
BREAK.
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.
>>> ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS FROM
THE HURRICANE ZONE, FLORENCE
TURNS DEADLY.
>> AT 12 NOON HIGH TIDES ROLLED?
>> RIGHT NOW YOU CAN'T TELL THE
RIVERS FROM THE ROADS.
>> IT'S BAD.
IT'S A LOT
