00:00:01,697 --> 00:00:02,331
NEIL?

2
00:00:02,331 --> 00:00:03,399
>> Neil: I'M SURE THAT MIGHT

3
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:04,834
COME UP IF THERE'S AN

4
00:00:04,834 --> 00:00:06,936
OPPORTUNITY FOR QUESTIONS.

5
00:00:06,936 --> 00:00:08,437
WE SHALL SEE.

6
00:00:08,437 --> 00:00:10,072
NOW WE HAVE MULTIPLE PRIMARIES

7
00:00:10,072 --> 00:00:12,875
GOING ON IN FOUR KEY STATES.

8
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,977
THE MOST CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED

9
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:16,145
WILL BE IN WEST VIRGINIA.

10
00:00:16,145 --> 00:00:17,446
14 HOURS UNTIL THE POLLS OPEN

11
00:00:17,446 --> 00:00:17,747
THERE.

12
00:00:17,747 --> 00:00:21,050
NOW THE PRESIDENT IS GETTING

13
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,220
INVOLVED.

14
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,856
PRESIDENT TRUMP URGING ONE

15
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:31,527
CANDIDATE TO BE REJECTED.

16
00:00:31,527 --> 00:00:33,262
WHAT DO YOU HAVE, PETER?

17
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:35,030
>> NEIL, THE PRESIDENT'S OPINION

18
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,398
IS VERY IMPORTANT HERE.

19
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:38,367
HE WON WEST VIRGINIA BY 42

20
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:38,701
POINTS.

21
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:40,436
I AM WHISPERING BECAUSE THE

22
00:00:40,436 --> 00:00:41,937
PERSON HE'S SAYING NOT TO VOTE

23
00:00:41,937 --> 00:00:44,340
FOR IS HAVING A PRESS CONFERENCE

24
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,142
IN A SMALL ROOM.

25
00:00:46,142 --> 00:00:48,577
IT'S DAN BLANKENSHIP.

26
00:00:48,577 --> 00:00:50,079
HE SAID TO THE GREAT PEOPLE OF

27
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,280
WEST VIRGINIA, WE HAVE TOGETHER

28
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,115
A REALLY GREAT CHANCE TO KEEP

29
00:00:53,115 --> 00:00:54,517
MAKING A BIG DIFFERENCE.

30
00:00:54,517 --> 00:00:56,952
THE PROBLEM IS, DON BLANKENSHIP

31
00:00:56,952 --> 00:00:59,054
CAN'T WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION

32
00:00:59,054 --> 00:01:01,323
IN YOUR STATE.

33
00:01:01,323 --> 00:01:02,925
NO WAY.

34
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:05,728
REMEMBER ALABAMA?

35
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:08,898
THAT ANTI-BLANKENSHIP MESSAGE

36
00:01:08,898 --> 00:01:10,132
CAME AS A SURPRISE TO

37
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:10,533
BLANKENSHIP.

38
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:12,201
HE SAID HE WAS IN TOUCH WITH THE

39
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:14,236
WHITE HOUSE POLITICAL ADVISERS

40
00:01:14,236 --> 00:01:15,671
ABOUT NEXT STEPS IF HE WON HERE.

41
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:18,240
>> I WENT TO THEM PERSONALLY AND

42
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,511
TALKED TO THEM ALONG THE PATH OF

43
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:24,079
THIS CAMPAIGN TO MAKE SURE WE

46
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:27,850
I DON'T KNOW IF HE DOESN'T

47
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,754
LISTEN TO THE POLITICAL ADVISERS

48
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:35,758
THAT I WAS DIRECTED TO TALK TO

49
00:01:35,758 --> 00:01:37,459

00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:38,460
PRESIDENT WAS NEUTRAL.

51
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,962

00:01:39,962 --> 00:01:41,463
CANDIDATE IS THE MOST

53
00:01:41,463 --> 00:01:41,864
TRUMP-LIKE.

54
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:43,599
NOW TWO CLAIM TO HAVE HIS

55
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:43,933

60
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:52,374

00:01:52,374 --> 00:01:54,443
WE FEEL REALLY GOOD.

62
00:01:54,443 --> 00:01:56,912

70
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:13,696
ABOUT THIS ISSUE TO DETERMINE IF

71
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:17,166
THIS REFUSAL TO COMPLY WITH

72
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,101
FEDERAL LAW VIOLATES THE TERMS

73
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:20,836

WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

81
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:33,515
