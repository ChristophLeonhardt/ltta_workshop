in the discussion about the likely effects of the tax bill as we've been talking about here a lot of corporations are quick to say look we're giving these bonuses we're giving fat a thousand dollars to some of our employees and that sounds good but we also found some other people who are gonna get a little tax bonus from this bill working at a corporation called the white house so according to an analysis Donald Trump will be personally benefiting from a tax cut of up to fifteen million dollars every single year and you know I wish we had more information we could be more sure but since he's the only person running for president modern history that didn't release his taxes we don't know for sure and we certainly know these gonna save even more money or I should say Ivanka and Donald jr. and Eric will save even more because of the changes to the estate tax but 15 million dollars a year that's pretty nice so first year doesn't count because they just go into effect so if you were to serve just one term just the three years remaining in his term he would make forty five million dollars by being president just on these one portion of this tax cuts let alone the other portions yes and so when he does PR gimmicks like oh I'm turning down my salary of four hundred thousand dollars yeah you got forty five million dollars to put through the tax cut that you pushed I think you'll be okay he also specifically said many times I'm gonna take a beating on this I'm gonna be financially hurt Sarah I could be Sanders would go and say he's going to lose money on this there was never any reason to believe that what a preposterous lie first of all none of the rich are hurt on any of it on any of it they didn't take away the loopholes so there's like almost no conceivable way the only thing is that he's theoretically a lot of his stuff is in New York maybe has to pay a little bit more local taxes but the rest of the tax cuts overwhelm that yeah and also just let's let's live in a fantasy land for a second and instead of the actual changes that this tax bill made instead what it did was lower taxes on people like me and people like you and so let's say people making between one dollar a year and seventy thousand dollars a year or something like that their taxes went way down the interesting thing about the way tax brackets work is that if you just take the top tax bracket for income over a couple hundred thousand dollars or whatever and you lower that that doesn't help me and that doesn't help you it helps the rich because they qualify for that but if you lower the lowest tax brackets that helps the person who just makes that it also helps the person who makes twice as much as that and it helps a person who makes a billion dollars a year because they also pay taxes on that portion of their income so even if he was telling the truth about what the bill was going to do he would financially benefit from that yeah and but no one's surprised that he's no one is sad but it's not just trumped by the way it's also some other people around him along with Trump himself Wilbur Ross Linda McMahon Betsy DeVos Stephen minuchin Rex Tillerson the people in his cabinet will benefit to the tune of about on average four point five million dollars from changes to the estate tax let alone I mean in fact that many of these are millionaires who are gonna make crazy money per year as well so so that's the different four and a half million that's because yeah of the estate tax not the pass-through tax so all those folks are multimillionaires including Donald Trump his family will also save four and a half million dollars from the estate tax yeah so the my favorite line is also closely you know was a Republican saying during this whole debate oh no the lowering the estate tax doesn't help the rich it only applies to the states of twenty-two million dollars so I'm pretty sure that's just the ridge there aren't that many middle-class guys making leaving 22 million dollars for their kids and like I said on a show last week if you're not sure we have an easy test for it do you live on an estate if you don't you probably aren't gonna end up paying these day tax if you like this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through Friday come enjoy ad-free by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
