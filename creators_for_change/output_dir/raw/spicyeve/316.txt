over the summer study abroad and um yeah

47
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,250
I had my interview today so that the

48
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,870
press could see if I was mentally stable

49
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,940
because he said the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past years people</font>

50
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,470
have had mental breakdowns and stuff

51
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,540
because the classes that in Portuguese

52
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,359
but you read the stuff in English and

53
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:31,790
you know being in different countries

54
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,040
some people just can't take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and I'm</font>

55
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,410
like if I can hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> it down in Nairobi I</font>

56
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,930
can't speak Swahili people looking at me

57
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,090
because they know I'm supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

58
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,190
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak Swahili and I can take</font>

59
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,590
that then I can definitely take being

60
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,690
lost in Brazil where nobody expects me

61
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,950
to know Portuguese because I'm American

62
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,570
