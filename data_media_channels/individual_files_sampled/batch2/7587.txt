tonight was a wild insane election night plenty of great news but marred by massive uncertainty in the most important race of the night and perhaps the whole primary election season so Kansas third District is where a Brandt welder is running for Congress he is a progressive Democratic backed by almost all the progressive organizations just Democrats p triple c our revolution and the list goes on he is a great phenomenal candidate ran a fantastic race leading the whole night and then there was a computer glitch in Johnson County as we stand now in the middle of the night / morning in Kansas it has still not been resolved so we covered they're all irate all the races for your live here at the Young Turks as we do want on every election night on the state local levels not the congressional level as candidates supported by our revolution move on and Working Families Party won almost everything it was a landslide almost alder endorse candidates one with a few minor exceptions so that is great news there was a couple of important losses for just Democrats and progressive candidates at the higher levels Cory Bush who was a hero of the movement hero and st. Louis and leading the protest won a few one of the first just Democrats ever she lost tonight to a very entrenched incumbent in Missouri's first district that's lacy clay abdullah saeed a wonderful progressive candidate in michigan lost the governor's race i my guess is that he will be back yeah so those are the downsides over all five just Democrats lost tonight but six have won which is a fantastic result is that the best single night it might be the best night ever for Justice Democrats and there's two outstanding Sarah Smith is still within striking distance of making it to the general election in Washington's ninth district that's they incumbent there is Adam Smith she's hanging on we don't know the results yet so that's an open question and obviously the biggest open question of the night is did Brent welder win or didn't he he currently has the lead with this terrible mysterious computer glitch in Johnson County understand that the other race going on in Kansas is on the Republican side it is for governor it is the incumbent against Kris Kobach Kris Kobach is one of the least trustworthy people in in American politics he lies non-stop about voter fraud creates things that are not true sanctioned by judge after judge after judge and this character is a Secretary of State which oversees elections in Kansas including his own the person running the Johnson County system is a guy by the name of Ronnie Metzger appointed by Kris Kobach so this is an absolute mess in Johnson County Kansas and right now as things stand in the middle of the night as we do this election coverage live there are no results in the Kobach race and in the welder race and there should be a massive investigation into what happened in Johnson County because at best case scenario is horrible incompetence yes because it's not just that we don't know the results it is according to the Kansas City Star reporting that a lot of people because of the mess did not vote yeah some of the end and subject went back to work some poll workers were unsure of the backup plans some voters think their ballots might have been miscast an absolute debacle in Kansas tonight and so I don't know if once they declare official results if they're actually official if people are going to take their word for it or not so that is I'm certainly not gonna take their word for it no decent reporters should take their word for it so that's where we end the program tonight with a mess in Kansas that not only do we not know who was won tonight but when they declare the winners there's gonna be a giant question mark over it as to who actually won and and even if it's the people we wanted to win it's a problem anytime you have an issue where you've not positive who actually won it is a terrible problem now let alone if they pause the election for a computer glitch when Kovac was losing and and in our case welder was winning if they come back with the opposite results after the glitch is fixed and they say no Kovac is now won he was losing in that County it when that glitch happened Kovac was losing in the beginning the other counties kept on County he took a slight minuscule lead but when they paused Johnson Johnson County Kovac was way down in Johnson County winning overall but down in the only County still outstanding that's right and there's plenty of votes there that would if those those trends continued would Costco back to election right it looked obvious yes yes if they come back and go oh no no it switched and Kovac won the county and then won the state then I go from best-case scenario of incompetence to we're leaning towards other scenarios and either way there should be a huge investigation and if they say they come back and also say hey well they're also magically lost not magically but then he was winning but now he is lost yeah you'll excuse us if we don't trust that result based on your word or any so-called official results so I guess tomorrow if there are results at all at least from our end the investigation begins because we cannot let the stand if they come back with questionable results that didn't match what we're seeing with our own eyes and this is not hindsight I'm trying to be as clear as possible we're in the middle of it it's live it's happening now so when they say it's minor later it's not true it's not minor they don't have the results as we speak yeah supposedly they're coming within a few hours if they do tomorrow morning on the damage report we will have those results assuming there is anything
