TALENT, STRENGTH AND
DEVOTION THAT HAVE
CHARACTERIZED HIS ENTIRE
CAREER.
>> Martha: THAT WAS
PRESIDENT TRUMP SWEARING IN
ADMIRAL KARL SCHULTZ AS THE
NEW HEAD OF THE U.S. COAST
HE HAS BIG SHOES TO FILL.
THE SMALLEST MILITARY BRANCH
HAS A GIANT MISSION TO GIVE
YOU A SENSE DURING LAST
YEAR'S BACK-TO-BACK
HURRICANES.
SEARCH AND RESCUE EFFORTS BY
THE SERVICE SAVED MORE THAN
11,000 LIVES COAST GUARD
PLACE A CRUCIAL FRONT LINE
ROLE IN NATIONAL DEFENSE.
FIGHTING TO KEEP DRUG
SMUGGLERS FROM BRINGING IN
OPIOIDS.
ALL WITH FEWER THAN 40,000
SERVICE MEMBERS IN THEIR
RANKS.
JOINING ME EXCLUSIVELY FOR
FIRST INTERVIEW AS
COMMANDANT ADMIRAL KARL
SCHULTZ.
CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK
YOU FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT.
>> GOOD EVENING, MARTHA AND
THANKS FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF
BEING HERE TONIGHT.
>> Martha: A LOT OF PEOPLE
LOOK AT THAT LIST AND MANY
PEOPLE ARE NOT AS FAMILIAR
WITH WHAT THE COAST GUARD
DOES AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
TO PROTECTING OUR BORDERS.
WE WATCH THE DEBATE OVER
WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE
SOUTHERN BORDER RIGHT NOW.
WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO
UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE WORK
THAT YOU DO THERE AND WHAT
YOU THINK WE NEED TO DO IN
ORDER TO MAKE IT SAFER?
>> AS YOU MENTIONED IN THE
INTERIM THE COAST GUARD IS
THE SMALLEST OF THE FIVE
SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF
HOMELAND SECURITY.
MEN AND WOMEN ARE ABSOLUTELY
CRITICAL TO THE HOMELAND
SECURITY OF THE NATION AND
THE NATIONAL SECURITY.
YOU MENTIONED BORDER
SECURITY.
YOU KNOW, ON THE MARITIME
FRONT, WE TEND TO PUSH AND
TRY TO PUSH OUR BORDERS AS
FAR AWAY FROM THE U.S. COAST
LINE AS POSSIBLE AGAINST
TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINALS.
LAST YEAR WE WERE WITH
PARTNER AGENCIES AND
INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS STEM
491,000 POUNDS OF COCAINE
KEPT THAT FROM AMERICAN
SHORES.
THAT'S THE SAME ILLICIT
NARCOTICS THAT FUELS THE
IMMIGRATION FROM HUN
IMMIGRATION FROM HONDURAS,
GUATEMALA EL SALVADOR.
SHOW UP AT OUR SOUTHWEST
BORDER.
>> Martha: YOU ARE VERY
BUSY.
IN TERMS OF THE NORTH PART
OF THE GLOBE AND TO THE
SOUTH, TOO.
THE ICE CUTTERS THAT YOU
NEED TO FUNCTION.
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
WHAT YOU NEED THAT PERHAPS
YOU DON'T HAVE AND WE WILL
LOOK AT THE ACTION OF THESE
ICE CUTTERS ON THE SCREEN
HOW DO WE PRESSURE UP WITH
WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE
FOR THIS CAPABILITY?
>> ABSOLUTELY, MARTHA.
SO THE COAST GUARD ISVEL
RELEVANT IN WHAT WE CALL THE
HIGH LAT ATTITUDES OR POLAR
REGIONS UP IN THE ARTIC.
WE ARE OPERATING THE SOLE
UNITED STATES ICE BREAKER,
THE POLISH STAR.
BUILT IN THE 70S MORE THAN
40 YEARS OLD WITH THE
SUPPORT OF THE
ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS
WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO BUILD A
HEAVY ICE BREAKER
REPLACEMENT TO SERVE OUR
NATIONAL INTEREST THAT'S
PROJECTING OUR SOVEREIGNTY
THERE.
ALSO OPERATE IN THE
ANTARCTIC WHERE WE GO INTO
THE STATION AND ALLOW
CRITICAL SUPPLIES TO GET IN
THERE TO ATTEND TO THE
NATION'S INTEREST IN THAT
PART OF THE WORLD AS WELL.
>> Martha: OBVIOUSLY THE
HURRICANES WERE DEVASTATING
AND YOUR RESPONSE TO THEM,
THE COAST GUARD RESPONSE
REALLY TURNED AROUND IN SOME
WAYS A FUNDING ISSUE THAT
COULD HAVE BEEN TOUGH FOR
THE COAST GUARD.
THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE
INITIALLY CAME IN WANTED TO
CUT 1.3 BILLION FROM THE
BUDGET IN ORDER TO FUND THE
BORDER WALL.
BUT THEN HE WAS SO TAKEN
WITH THE WORK THAT YOU ALL
DID IN THE HURRICANE THAT HE
SAID THIS AND PUT BACK THE
MONEY.
WATCH.
IN LAST YEAR'S HISTORIC
HURRICANE SEASON, OUR COAST
GUARD, HEROES THEY ARE,
SAVED ALMOST 12,000 AMERICAN
LIVES IN THAT SHORT PERIOD.
IT'S AOUN UNBELIEVABLE
NUMBER WHEN YOU THINK OF IT.
>> UNBELIEVABLE NUMBER.
>> Martha: IN TERMS OF
FUNDING, DO YOU FEEL LIKE
HAVE YOU WHAT YOU NEED?
I GUESS YOU NEVER HAVE
ENOUGH, RIGHT?
>> WELL, MARTHA, I THINK YOU
MENTIONED THE COAST GUARD IS
THE NATION'S MARITIME FIRST
RESPONDER.
AS THE PRESIDENT NOTED WE
RESPONDED IN THE SYSTEM MORE
THAN 11,000, ALMOST 12,000
PEOPLE.
THE FIRST RESPONDER IT'S
REALLY NOT ABOUT THE NUMBER.
IT'S ABOUT WHO THAT NEXT
PERSON YOU ARE ABOUT TO SAVE
IS YEAH, WE HAVE AN
ORGANIZATION THAT 42,000
ACTIVE DUTY STRONG.
MY CONCERN COMING IN IS TO
ASSURE THE READINESS OF THE
COAST GUARD.
I TALK ABOUT THE COAST GUARD
ABOUT BEING READY, RELEVANT
RESPONSE ORGANIZATION.
THAT'S WHAT GETS AFTER THE
NEEDS OF THE NATION.
WE ARE TIED, OUR ECONOMIC
PROSPERITY.
OUR GLOBAL INFLUENCE ARE
TIED TO OUR MARITIME AND THE
COAST GUARD IS VERY MUCH A
PART OF THAT CONVERSATION.
>> Martha: OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENEMIES
THAT THE UNITED STATES
FACES.
EARLIER TODAY THE PRESIDENT
HELD SORT OF AN IMPROMPTU
NEWS CONFERENCE.
HERE IS WHAT HE SAID ABOUT
KIM JONG UN.
>> WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF
BAD THINGS ABOUT ROCKET MAN
AND SUDDENLY YOU GUYS ARE
GOOD FRIENDS.
>> WE GOT ALONG WELL.
GOOD CHEMISTRY.
WE REALLY DID HAVE GOOD
CHEMISTRY.
>> DOES THAT CONCERN YOU AT
ALL THE THINGS THAT THE
PRESIDENT IS SAYING ABOUT
KIM JONG UN ARE SOMEWHAT
POSITIVE GIVEN HIS HISTORY?
>> WELL, MARTHA, THE COAST
GUARD PLAYS ITS ROLE AND
SUPPORT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF
DEFENSE.
ON THE DAILY BASIS ACROSS
THE SEVEN CONTINENTS WE ARE
SUPPORTING 68 COMBATANT
COMMANDERS IN THAT POSITION
I WOULD DEFER TO THE
PENTAGON IN TERMS OF WHAT
THE PRESIDENT SPEAK WITH
NORTH KOREA.
WE ARE VERY MUCH A PART OF
THE AMBULANCE FOR ANY TYPE
OF CONTINGENCY.
COMMANDERS UNDER THE
DEPARTMENT.
RORKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
