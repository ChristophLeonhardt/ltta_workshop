on Thursday in an apparent attempt to demonstrate that voters in the United States and Germany couldn't be the only ones to embrace reactionary unpredictability the voters of the United Kingdom dealt the Conservative Party a stunning blow elevating the far left Labour Party led by a know'm Chomsky's loon named Jeremy Corbyn to the brink of power the Conservatives led by Teresa May will still retain leadership thanks to a coalition government but they were expected to walk away with the election and labour was supposed to be in disarray instead the Conservatives are on the verge of chaos and labour is united under a terrorist supporting anti-semite with a gut-level hatred of Western civilization well done Brits Josh crash our of national journal makes an even more important point though the youth vote in Britain went overwhelmingly for Corbett quote Corbin's surprisingly competitive showing was fueled by young voters who rallied behind labour by a whopping 34 point margin 63 to 29 according to British exit polling for all the fears of creeping nationalism it's the growing discontent of the Millennial vote that's been a consistent theme in recent Western elections many young voters are rejecting capitalism entirely attracted to rhetoric promising free tuition and a generous social safety net at a time when many are struggling to make ends meet numerous studies also show younger voters are much more skeptical toward the value of democracy than their elders crash are rightly points out the 27% of young French voters felt for an actual communist jean-luc m√©lenchon in the United States Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders drew quote more than a more under 30 voters than Clinton and Trump combined crash hour is right to note that the reactionary left is responding to the reactionary right the young voters who resonate it's Corbin Milan Sean and Sanders were responding in part to brexit lepen and Trump and there's nothing new about young people embracing radical politics the 60s and 70s were full of such elections see George McGovern and the 1930s were full of radical political movements worldwide supported by youngsters each generation has its own brand of radicalism and given the success of the post-world post-cold-war neoliberal consensus the rebellion was bound to come in the form of fire left redistribution ISM Clinton and Bush and Blair and Chirac were all of the same general mind on capitalism young people have reacted to that background commentators are trying to find economic rationale for the blowback but there is something going on we live at a unique time in human history war between major powers is almost inconceivable and despite economic worries the vast majority of people are employed the American unemployment rate is currently four point seven percent the Brits four point eight percent the front unemployment rate is nine point six percent where it's been hovering since the economic crash of 2008 yes terrorism is a threat as his multiculturalism but the far left is in pledging to do anything about any of those things No what we have here is an entire generation of Westerners brought up to believe that prosperity and freedom are the norm and given a background noise and at the next mission for which they should fight is redistribution ISM income inequality is the next Rubicon's across and income inequality Springs from the same origins as racism and sexism and bigotry Western civilization this perspective is not coming from disillusionment its springing from an existential meaninglessness taught by two generations of parents who abandon traditional values in favor of secularism and are now surprised to find their secular kids and grandkids embracing transformative Marxism as a way to animate their lives people want meaning economics does not provide meaning but causes do Bernie appears to have a cause so does Corbin so didn't along as economists as economists Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaus ed way back in 1998 when it appeared the global capitalist consensus was unshakable quote a system that takes the pursuit of self-interest and profit as its guiding light does not necessarily satisfy the yearning in the human soul for belief and some higher meaning beyond materialism few people would die with the words free markets on their lips the West has failed to teach its children meaning the children found their own meaning in Marxism and so we appear ready to reimburse the horrors of the past unless we get to work right now teaching young Westerners that they are part of a fight for liberty and freedom and responsibility rather than for transformative or crushing redistribution ISM I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show all righty we are gonna get into everything Coby related we're also gonna talk more about the UK election which really is quite stunning for Teresa May the worst political miscalculation in the modern era she called snap elections and then she ended up almost being thrown out of office which is just an amazing thing we also have the mailbag today yeah hey so if you want to be part of the live mailbag you're gonna have to go over to Dan Lee Weyer

reflect there are a bunch of headlines that comment out of the James Comey hearing and I want to play I think the three key clips we have a little mashup here of the key clips from the Comey hearing first of all here are the headlines from clips we're about straight first of all Comey said openly the president Trump and his staff did not ask did not ask for killing of the Russian investigation this destroys the Democrat narrative remember as I said yesterday the entire Democratic narrative since Hillary lost the election was that Hillary lost because Donald Trump worked with Vladimir Putin to corrupt the election and in doing so he then had to fire James Comey because Comey was this close to finding out about it but that was their narrative that was completely debunked Comey said that yesterday also in other big news attorney general Loretta Lynch apparently attempted to influence the Clinton investigation while Comey was there that was a big piece of breaking news as well and then the piece of news that the left is jumping on which is the Comey called Trump a liar several times in the in the in the hearings yesterday and the final piece of big news is that Comey leaked his memos to prompt the naming of a special counsel so people on the right are jumping on this to suggest that this means that Comey is a leaker and at commis going to be prosecuted for leaking we'll talk about all of these things but here are the key clips from me from the hearing yesterday did any individual working for this administration including the Justice Department ask you to stop the Russian investigation no at one point the Attorney General had directed me not to call it an investigation but instead to call it a matter which confused me and concerned me and although the law required no reason at all to fire an FBI director the administration then chose to defame me and more importantly the FBI by saying that the organization was in disarray that it was poorly led that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader those were lies plain and simple by asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons by asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel okay so here were the big headlines and there's a lot of conflicts over what the headlines should be I mean just to show you how much conflict that was what the headlines should be this is a a picture of CNN and Fox News is covering the exact same hearing and having precisely opposite headlines here it is the conflicting KY runs you can see CNN saying that trumps that Comey took Trump's request about dropping the Flint investigation as a directive and then on the right you see Fox News saying Comey the President did not order me to let the Flint probe go so it you know again everyone sort of take me out of this what they want to hear I'm gonna give you the big headlines as I saw them yesterday and then we're gonna go through what the reaction to all this has been so as I said first headline Comey basically blows out of the water the Democratic narrative that there was collusion between Trump and Russia in this election cycle and that Trump fired Co means to cover this up even Chris Matthews is acknowledging this now here's Chris Matthews acknowledging as much but the big story to me has always been as all of us and I think Nicole really touched on it there the assumption of the critics of the president of his pursuers you might say is that somewhere along the line in the last year the president's something that deal with colluding with the Russians something to do the helping hand encouraging them feeding their desire to affect the election in some way some role they played some conversation he had with Michael Flynn or Paul Manafort somewhere and yet what came apart this morning was that theory because in Toorak you regards the president said according to the written testimony of mr. Comey go ahead and get him anybody satellites in my operation and nail them I'm with you on that so that would mean man-mana Ford Carter paid someone else like that and then he also came across they what was fascinating Comey said that basically Flynn wasn't central to the rushed investigation that he was touching on it that there was of course Flynn had an honest that yet we assume wasn't honest and his answering of the official forms he had a fill out to become become that security head but they were only touched on that that it wasn't really related to that but he could be flipped for that but in other words they could flip him because they had him caught on something he dishonestly answered but he wasn't sense would seem to the Russian thing and I've always assumed what Trump was afraid of he had said something to Flynn and Flint could be flipped on that and he Flynn would testify against the president that he had had some conversation with Flynn in terms of dealing with the Russians affirmatively and if that's not the case where's the there there if it is Rafi this is anyone what Matthews is saying right there what Mathis saying right there is the key and that's the thing that Trump should be seizing on because that two bunks the entire leftist narrative and when even Chris man there are AC gubbins know that show getting her morning Greg's have put Kelly Kappa live it up pelipper even even Chris Matthews gets it that demonstrates that the Democratic narrative fell apart so that was headline number one headline number two was that Loretta Lynch pressure James Comey to change the way they were terming the investigation into Hillary Clinton calling it instead of an investigation calling it a matter okay now that had already been revealed by the New York Times way back in April people really didn't pay attention to it at the time Comey said it now so now it's in the testimony and people on the right are jumping on that yes that's terrible and yes Comey should have done something about he should have gone public with it or he should have written a memo to file as he's so fond of doing and all of that is true it is also true to be fair that if we are going to say that we are disturbed by Loretta Lynch putting pressure on James Comey in how he did so discusses the Hillary investigation then we should be similarly concerned if President Trump is putting pressure on call me in any way with regard to any other investigation like let's be a little bit consistent here in all of this okay third headline president Trump apparently acted improperly and Comey found it troubling so we can't get away from and this is what the left is jumping on they've now pivoted from their original narrative to the new narrative which is that Trump is a bully and a thug because Trump said to Comey pulled them aside in a meeting told everybody else to get out of the room and then told him he hoped that Comey could find a way to let Flynn go now people on the right are sort of ignoring this or pretending it doesn't exist or saying well it's not obstruction no one's saying it has to be technical obstruction as Alan Dershowitz has said Trump could overtly tell James Comey that he wanted him to drop the investigation and that he would and he's ordering him to do so and that wouldn't necessarily constitute obstruction of justice on a criminal level but impeachment is not a criminal offense in each mint is about what is politically palatable to do Democrats could jump on this and they are the biggest problem for Trump is that now because he said all this stuff now you could end up with the situation where Trump actually is under investigation so we found out that Trump is not under investigation right we found out that he wasn't under investigation when Comey was the head of the FBI and the Comey told him that several times and that's probably why Trump fired him is cuz Comey wouldn't say it publicly but now because of the conversations that he had with Comey he may very well be under federal investigation from Bob Mueller these special investigators that means that Comey if he wanted to nail Trump has played his cards exactly rightly which means that Comey is kind of a sleaze but it also means that Comey has outplayed Trump here right here's how the chain of events went basically Comey was called into Trump's office and Trump said to him I'd appreciate if you could get rid of this Flynn thing right I hope that you get rid of this Flynn think everyone I put it and then Comey didn't pay attention to Trump continued on his merry wife didn't see anything so wrong he had to report it and then he gets fired and then Trump tweets that there must be conversations between Trump and Comey that are on tape and home we better hope they're earned at which point Comey responds by revealing the presence of the memos which prompts the creation of the special investigator and now that special investigator is gonna look into Trump over obstruction so in other words Trump did two things that now have put him on the hook where he wouldn't have been on the before one he had conversations with economy about Flynn that he shouldn't had and two he then tweeted about how he had tapes which were which prompted supposedly Comey to reveal the memos in leaked the memos out which prompted the appointment of the special prosecutor now some people on the right are saying well that means we should get rid of the special prosecutor a little bit late for that okay guys regardless of whether you think that Comey did the wrong thing in revealing the contents of the memos in order to in order to debunk what Trump was saying about him the cats out of the bag you shut down the special prosecutor right now it looks like Trump really does have something to hide so Trump's in a catch-22 because now the special prosecutor according to Comey will probably end up looking at Trump's activity toward Comey and may come up with some sort of obstruction charge or at least the implication of obstruction giving Democrats something to hang their hat on in other words the quote unquote cover of a crime that didn't occur may snag Trump because Trump has a big mouth that's what Democrats are hoping anyway that's it that's what Democrats are hoping now I want to talk about how Trump can get out of this and what Trump actually should be saying about all of this because I think that he has a pretty good case to make if you were just honest about it but he's not making that case unfortunate we'll talk about it in one second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at the US concealed-carry Association so every day you see stories about somebody breaking into somebody's house somebody break into

headlines that came out about Comey and with the newfound attempt by the left to push the notion that Trump obstructed justice even though as Chris Matthew says there is no real there there there's something that Trump could do right what Trump should do here's what Trump should do I basically wrote this out yesterday if I work from here is what I would say I would say this I did not collude with Russia during the 2016 election I've said that a long paper and comet confirmed there is no evidence to suggest collusion by me he given admitted finally that I was not under personal investigation he told me privately he wouldn't say it publicly and that made me very very angry that is the real reason I fired him out of anger anger that I was not being exonerated in public view even though Comey knew I was not under investigation also I did not obstruct any investigation Comey admits I never tried to obstruct the Russia investigation he admits I said he should check out my associates on Russia as far as my comments on general Clint it was just as I like general Flynn it wasn't me I was trying to cover anything up they were hot staid and hot-headed statements about what I hoped would have a say I hope he's hope in order I know how to give an hour I'm done a freaking Trump we have no evidence that Flynn even did anything right Flynn lied about talking with Russians is that a crime isn't it maybe but it's not a big enough crime for me to care about that's why I said something to James coming why is this even a big deal Comey knows I didn't obstruct the Flint investigation he didn't even quit he'd even report it look I should've had patience I should have had patience with the process but I'm not a patient guy I want to get stuff done the cloud hanging over my administration thanks to the Democrats is crippling my ability to get something done don't call it obstruction it isn't that's nasty there's no underlying crime I didn't obstruct when there's no crime so let's get back to work I'll stop being a patient and you guys stop saying stupid stuff right that's what Trump should say that's what Trump should say and if Trump actually said that then he might be able to make a good defense what he should not do is get into a credibility fight with James Comey you should not get in the business of trying to say that James Comey is lying about him and that James Comey is not telling the truth about what he said about Flint the reason being Comey just testified before Congress under oath under penalty of perjury who is more credible now I know that a lot of Trump in saying he's more credible than call me okay but Comey is a lawyer Comey knows that he doesn't want to get caught up in a perjury charge and he knows that right now the entire Trump administration would be happy to charge him with perjury so the idea that he's gonna go out there and outright lie is just silly like commis not stupid okay he may not be your cup of tea but he's not a stupid man and if Trump wants to pit his perception of honesty against Kobe's perception of honesty that's not a battle Trump can win what Trump should have done is play a little bit of jiu-jitsu here Trump should have said what Trump should have said is everything Comey said is true as to content but not as to meaning right that's what he should have said and I'm an impatient guy I met with him because I was upset about the Flint stuff I didn't mean you should quash the invest it look did I even have a follow-up did I even try to quash the Flint investigation hard to be accuse me of obstruction when I didn't do anything other than saying to him that I hoped he would see his way clear to letting Flynn go maybe it's sort of a ham hand and thing for me to say but obstruction really and again even Comey confirmed that there's this Trump Russia stuff is a big nothing burger right that's what Trump should be doing unfortunately that's not what Trump is doing so Trump came out on Twitter today when Trump immediately decided to attack homies credibility which is just not smart because again he's relying on commis credibility in order for him to get out of the Trump Russia stuff right he wants to say that Comey is credible when he says that Trump was not under investigation there's no evidence of collusion but he wants to say he's not credible when it comes to what Trump said to Comey in the privacy of the Oval Office or at Trump Tower so Trump tweets quote James Comey better hope there are no tapes of our conversations before it starts leaking to the press that's what he originally tweeted that got him in trouble now here's what he tweeted quote despite so many false statements and lies total and complete vindication and Wow Comey is a leaker okay on this leaker thing quick note people who are trying to say that Comey should be prosecuted for leaking his notes were not government documents hey if I have a personal diary that I am taking and it's not classified and this apparently was not classified material and did not exert a certain executive privilege from a legal from the lawyers perspective this is not prosecutable okay what Comey did you may not like the leak you may think it makes him a politically motivated actor I certainly do but I think that to say that he's a leaker and therefore he did something illegal he didn't actually do anything illegal any more than Trump did something illegal by talking to the Russians about Israeli Intel he has the capacity to do it it may be bad but it's not necessarily illegal again this is just bad strategy I'm not saying the Trump again did anything deeply wrong here in fact I'm trying to figure out a good way to the Fed and Trump but this is not the smartest way to do this you know in conclusion with that he sends out mark castle as his lawyer to make the case that Trump was that the Comey is lying about Trump this is not a smart tactic it's again Trump fighting back and he's fighting back aggressively rather than in intelligent fashion here's Mark Castle it's his lawyer saying that commis the liar not Trump the president never suggested that mr. Comey quote let Flynn go close quote okay so with him saying that is really not smart because again unless he has tapes to prove that and he said he has and now the White House won't say whether there are tapes or whether there aren't tapes the tapes will be subpoenaed Trump among those under oath is going to lose this particular credibility battle the best move would be to do what I just said admit basically that everything that Comey said is true and then say commis misconstruing everything because commis a politically motivated actor I'm a hothead I say things out of turn but that's not what I meant there's no obstruction here there's no underlying crime that's what terms should be saying instead he's not and that's leading Democrats to be put in a position where they can actually do him some damage I'm gonna talk about that in just a second but for that I'm gonna have to go over to Daley wire.com go ahead and subscribe it's a Lee Weyer calm right now $8 a month gets you access to the rest of the show live you can be part of the mailbag which we are now doing on Fridays because hey we're five days a week now which is super exciting plus if you want in the annual subscription at daily wire then if you spend if you get that annual subscription you get a free signed copy of this very book the one that I hold here in my hand say it so it's a book by me and my dad there we are yes my dad's my best friend we're actually to have mine next week to talk about the book actually which will be a lot of fun because my dad's awesome my dad is the really nice version of me which is to say I mean really really nice I'm not super nice my dad is like the nicest person anyone knows we're heading to have mine next week to talk about the book say it so you got a free signed copy when you go over to daily wire.com right now and get an annual subscription or if you just want to listen later go over to iTunes or SoundCloud leave us a review we always appreciate it and make sure that it's 5 stars because otherwise we won't appreciate it so go over to iTunes or SoundCloud right now and do that we are the largest conservative podcast in the nation
