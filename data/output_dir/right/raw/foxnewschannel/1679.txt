PYONGYANG ALSO LEFT OPEN TO

00:00:43,852 --> 00:00:45,621
QUESTION WHETHER THE U.S. AND

25
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:47,256
NORTH KOREA MEETING WOULD BE

26
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:47,623
SCUTTLED.

27
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:48,490
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS THINK IT

28
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,492
ALL MIGHT BE SO MUCH

29
00:00:50,492 --> 00:00:51,860
NORTH KOREAN BLUSTER.

30
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,495
>> THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE

31
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:55,831
FULLY EXPECTED.

32
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,466

AND READY FOR TOUGH

34
00:00:58,467 --> 00:00:59,868
NEGOTIATIONS, AND IF THEY WANT

35
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:01,637
TO MEET, WE WILL BE READY.

36
00:01:01,637 --> 00:01:04,673
IF THEY DON'T, THAT'S OKAY,

37
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:04,973
ALSO.

38
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:06,542
WE WILL CONTINUE WITH A CAMPAIGN

39
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:08,277
OF MAXIMUM PRESSURE IF THAT'S

40
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,678
THE CASE, BUT IF THEY WANT TO

41
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:12,247
MEET THE PRESIDENT THEN WE WILL

42
00:01:12,247 --> 00:01:13,916
CERTAINLY BE READY.

43

45
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:17,953
RATIONALE FOR ITS TANTRUM,

46
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,988
NORTH KOREA MADE CLEAR THAT ITS

47
00:01:19,988 --> 00:01:23,392
ISSUE WITH JOHN BOLTON TOLD

48

FOX'S CHRIS BOLTON ON THE NINTH.

49
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,430
BOLTON SAYS THERE IS ALREADY A

50
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,331
MODEL FOR WHAT NORTH KOREAN

51
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:30,232
DENUCLEARIZATION WOULD LOOK

52
00:01:30,232 --> 00:01:30,632
LIKE.

53
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,234
>> WE HAVE VERY MUCH IN MIND OF

54
00:01:32,234 --> 00:01:36,271
THE LIBYA MODEL FROM 2003-2004.

55
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:37,439
THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENCES.

56
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,507
THE LIBYAN PROGRAM WAS MUCH

57
00:01:38,507 --> 00:01:40,476
SMALLER BUT THAT WAS BASICALLY

58
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:43,011
THE AGREEMENT THAT WE MADE IT.

59
00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:44,813
SO WE WILL WANT TO TEST

60
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,048
NORTH KOREA IN THIS FIRST

61
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:47,516
MEETING FOR EVIDENCE THAT THEY

62
00:01:47,516 --> 00:01:49,585
HAVE MADE THAT STRATEGIC

63
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:53,789
DECISION.

INSISTING ANY DENUCLEARIZATION

67
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:57,760
WOULD COME FROM THE PRESIDENT,

68
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,329
AND THAT HE HAS HIS OWN IDEAS.

69
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,631
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT THAT AS A

70
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:03,098
SPECIFIC THING.

71
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:04,666
I KNOW THAT COMMENT WAS MADE BUT

72
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,034
THERE IS NOT A COOKIE-CUTTER

73
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:08,237
MODEL ON HOW THIS WORKS.

74
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:09,238
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT TRUMP

75
00:02:09,238 --> 00:02:10,672

YOU ARE AWARE THAT HE IS THE

78
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:16,812

OF THOSE EXPENSES AND HE WAS

93
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,672
REIMBURSED IN 2017.

94
00:02:43,672 --> 00:02:44,640
THE PRESIDENT CONTENDS HE WAS

95
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,674
NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT THE

96
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:49,678

BY GETTING AHEAD OF IT, BRET, IT

132
00:03:52,074 --> 00:03:53,542

THIS IS AN INDICATION, BRET,

150
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:28,243
THAT MUELLER MAY BE LOOKING INTO
