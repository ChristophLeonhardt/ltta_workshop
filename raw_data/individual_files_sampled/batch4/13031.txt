people get a little confused about this because they have this idea of God as this authoritarian bossing people around but they also can't understand why he allows evil and of course he permits evil cuz he's not bossing you around he's not telling you what to do let me put it to you this way if I said to you if you go to the gym and exercise you will have a trim attractive body and be healthier if you don't go to the gym and exercise and you just sit around all day you're gonna be fat and you're gonna risk dying young and you're gonna risk being in bad health would you turn to me and say don't tell me what to do I'm not telling you what to do I'm simply telling you how the world works I can't make you go to the gym and exercise I can only tell you that that's gonna be better for your health than if you don't do it that's all God is telling you he's telling you this kind of behavior is gonna have one result and that kind of behavior is gonna have a different kind of result
