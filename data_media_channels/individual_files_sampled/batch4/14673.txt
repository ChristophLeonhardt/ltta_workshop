here's the latest on brexit Theresa May is kicking the can down the road in order to avoid a conflict with Ireland which could mean breaks it doesn't happen until 2023 the Northern Ireland issue is a really big problem in this whole bracelet debate and so the issue is that if we leave the European Union that means Northern Ireland will have left the EU as well but Northern Ireland is connected to the Republic of Ireland which is a member of the EU which means there's literally a border that will be unmanned there'll be no physical border between the two as a result of the Good Friday Agreement and that means an external border of the European Union is completely open and that's a huge issue how do you solve this how do you solve that when you've got an open border that needs to be closed but a border that cannot be closed because of the Good Friday Agreement and if you do close it then there's going to be riots in Ireland horrible situation and I wouldn't have to want to have to deal with it so I do feel for Theresa May on this issue that particularly like the woman I think she's very dangerous in lots of areas but honestly I people might laugh at this so I'll be honest with you I think Teresa may actually wants to achieve breaks it may be I'm a minority here I think she wants to do it because it would be her legacy and an amazing feat to pull off but she can't do it her own party isn't behind her like half the party is auntie Briggs it anyway and then she's got labour to contend with and then she's got the lords to contend with and then she's got the Northern Ireland deal so what's the latest well the latest is Teresa Mays asked the EU four more years of brexit transition to the point where it could take as long as 2023 so Business Insider here Teresa may ask the EU for an extra two years on breaks it transition to resume to ask the EU for an extension to 2023 this would expense extend the brexit process on seven years after Britain voted to leave the EU that's scandalous the proposal will be highly controversial with conservative MPs too right Tory brags the tears have threatened to oust me for hard breaks it is not delivered so and it goes on to say that for another two years of practice and there's no government struggles to come up with a proposal for arrangements that would avoid a hard border with Ireland this is what this is all about it's Ireland this isn't a possible situation maybe this might make me a bit unpopular here but maybe we just have to build some kind of border maybe not a wall but maybe a manned border in Ireland maybe that just has to be maybe there just has to be a border what other solution is that so this is interesting as well because the next general election is 2022 and Theresa May has confirmed previously that she wants to serve a full five-year term till 2022 I remember talk when she first began p.m. that she might not be willing to do a second term I'm not sure whether that's the case still I mean she probably wouldn't but what this means is if it goes on beyond 2023 then that means there's a full year for a new prime minister it's a royally screwed things up again and that's assuming it only goes on to 2023 for a while you know it could be going on until 2035 or 2060 I think I remember reading 2060 for some deals don't quote me on it so 2022 is the next general election that means it could be a very very dangerous situation in a few years time and breaks it could be Scott but even if we get a great deal that it's coming into effect in 2023 who could imagine if a Labour government comes in or a coalition government comes in before the end of the process could it could it be reversed in other news Tory MP Andrea Jenkins quits government role to fight for brexit which I thought was interesting a leave backing MP is resigned from her junior government role saying she wants to fight for brexit got a good on you girl she quit as a parliamentary private secretary saying she wanted to commit to other duties said that Teresa may have her full support but warned we need to leave the customs union so bit of a backlash within the Tory party good to see although it's interesting over this island issue labour would be neutral in any border poll so it's Jeremy Corbyn let's watch this this is from yesterday your Northern Ireland secretary comes to you and says Prime Minister Coburn I think the conditions are right now to have a border pole at that point what does a Corbin government do do you campaign do you remain neutral do you follow your long-held United I it's within the terms of the Good Friday Agreement that such a poll could be held if there was a willingness to do so and I think then at that point you don't stand in its way but it is within the terms the Good Friday Agreement and I think the UK government should be neutral in that respect I think Corbin is just trying to stay out of this game because I mean Corby's that should thank his lucky stars that he doesn't have to be the Prime Minister dealing with breaks it seriously I don't think anyone could really pull off this perfectly even if Nigel Ferrara was in charge so how would you solve the island issue it's a nightmare so Corbin should thank his lucky stars and there's no wonder that he's saying he'd be neutral in any kind of border poll another interesting story UK chasing a fantasy and brags it talks top EU official ones so I saw here that the EU wants the UK to agree to a backstop position for Northern Ireland that would come into force should a future trade deal or bespoke technological solutions failed to arise that could avoid the need for a hard border the EU official warned that progress on the Irish border letter and substantive progress was proving elusive quote we need to have the recognition that the backstop has to be Northern Ireland's specific we have to do away with the fantasy that there is an all UK solution to that so even the EU are calling your plans fantasy at this point this is why politicians don't talk about particular religions and particular ideologies that haters it's why they don't talk about mass immigration politicians just want to kick the can down the road someone else will deal with it later maybe Teresa Mays thinking at this point well if I can get most it breaks it in place and do a fairly reasonable job someone else can deal with the Northern Ireland situation later on and meanwhile she'll be retired or a backbencher at that point so this confirms to me that the politicians really are just kicking this down the road if there is a general election it would be interesting to see what happens but I would hope I would hope in a general election that the bragg's are tears of the Tory Party could come you know right to the front form of government but that would require changing a lot of their candidates so I guess we'll have to see but put it this way breaks it's not going to be happening for more years to come if you like that and want to see more remember to like and subscribe and down the new rebel app from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store you
