this is the conscious investor presented by Nuveen I'm here with Ahmet bori the CEO and co-founder of the global impact investing Network can you tell me what the global impact investing Network does sure the global impact investing network or the Djinn for short as a nonprofit organization dedicated increasing the scale and effectiveness of impact investing and so impact investments are investments that are made with the intention of generating a positive social and environmental impact alongside financial return and our network includes over 260 organizations in over 35 countries how do you find these investments and do they perform as well as traditional investments well the way you find it really depends on how you invest so the first thing if you have a financial advisor is to ask for them and increasingly financial advisors are being responsive and figure out how they can bring products to their clients but you do have to ask typically and so it's important to you know to make your interests known in terms of the returns we see that of the vast majority of impact investors you know based on our data over 90 percent are meeting their financial objectives through fine impact investments and so we have increasing data and performance research that really attests to the fact that you can achieve market rates of return through impact investments and you have more data - coming out soon and can you tell me what you guys found from your most recent survey absolutely so every year we do an annual survey of the leading impact investors and this year what we found is the market is currently at 220 billion according to the assets of these investors and it continues to grow and so over the past five years we've actually seen growth averaged around thirteen percent per year and that's only based on those investors already in their market the real story is also of course all those people around the world who are just starting to become impact investors and they represent huge potential not just in terms of capital but in terms of the impact that they can have on the world and when you look at when people are trying to have an impact how do they measure how successful they're being other than just financial performance so we're building a whole new practice around impact performance there's so much work that's been done to understand financial moments but we essentially have to build a whole new capacity to understand how we have an impact on very complex issues the good sign that we're seeing in the market is that investors really want to understand the performance and really want to push the frontier of how we think about performance so we have a variety of tools ranging from metrics to measure social and environmental performance called iris as well as a whole host of resources about how you actually go about building an impact measurement practice not only so you can understand how well you're doing but so you can manage to having n even a greater impact with your investments and what's the difference what's the trend who are the new who's the new capital coming in so we see actually new entrants in all and coming from all different parts of the market so I was just in Hong Kong last week and increasingly Asian families so wealthy families in China Thailand Malaysia Indonesia Indonesia are entering the market a few weeks ago is in Denmark meeting with pension funds and large banks and institutional vesser's are increasingly becoming active and impact investing and then of course at the individual level we see people at all ages active as impact investors but the huge wave of interests is coming from Millennials and as wealth is transferred to Millennials the data is indisputable that they want sustainability and impact to be part of their investment portfolios and overall where is the impact investing where are we trending well I think you know impact investing is part of a much bigger trend line and when you think of all the movement that's been changing the view of the role of the company and being more responsive to broader stakeholders and the way people think about their lives as consumers and wanting to buy more responsible products and what we think see impact investing is contributing to a broader shift and the change in with the role of capital and what we as a society expect money to do and an impact investing in many ways is proving that money can do more than just make more money and I think that's incredibly exciting and motivating to so many people around the world and how can you start to turn company's behavior so that they're thinking long term or that they're taking accountability for everyone that they're affecting it's a really important trend that we're seeing recognition among the leaders in finance and leaders in business that if they want to sustain long term performance they have to think about environmental and social issues I think one thing that we're excited about working with investors is that they have a lot of influence on how companies think about their performance and what stakeholders they respond to so as investors start to take social and environmental considerations into account thinking not just about financial performance but also the health of the planet and the well-being of communities that will influence corporate behavior in the positive direction and just speaking to individuals what would you ask people to do to be a part of this network to help yeah I think it's um it's a really exciting time and we're seeing you know interest in impact investing your booming all around the world but every individual has a role to play in this market so if you are a professional money manager you of course can steer capital and impact investments if you work at a big firm you of course can be an advocate within your institution whether it's an investor of course you can try to get them to make more impact investments or if you're operating a company you can start to kind of advocate for social environmental values being corporated a business and then ordinary individual investors can start to put capital to work and anything as simple as a savings account but also those with more assets of course have more to invest in more options and how did you become so interested in this why is this such an important issue for you well for me I had worked you know in business originally and learned a lot and really wanted to apply myself to something that had a deep sense of purpose and had an impact on the world and I work for a non-profit for a while and that was incredibly valuable for me and but I started to see there was a big opportunity to try to bridge the gap between the problems that the worlds facing and the resources we have to address it and with philanthropy and donations and government they're all part of the solution but we need to mobilize the private sector if we really want to have a dramatic impact on issues like climate change and inequality and that's what led me to impact investing when also it's personal to me in large part because of how it was brought up you know I was brought up with some trying circumstances my parents were divorced when I was three we lived on welfare for six years while my mom got her feet under it went to school and was able to get a solid middle-class job and from then on I've had tremendous opportunities you know and I'm very grateful for those but I also recognize the fact that many people who start in that place don't end up with the same opportunities so I see impact investing is playing a role in creating opportunities for all and that's part of what really motivates me to do this work you
