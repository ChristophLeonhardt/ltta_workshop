1
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:13,032
>> WHITE AND BLACK, POOR AND

2
00:00:13,032 --> 00:00:16,035
RICH, TOGETHER, THAT WE CAN WORK

3
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:17,036
TOGETHER.

4
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:19,438
NOT VIOLENCE, NOT DISORDER, BUT

5
00:00:19,438 --> 00:00:21,040
COMPASSION AND LOVE AND PEACE.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,309
THAT'S WHAT THIS COUNTRY SHOULD

7
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:25,845
STAND FOR.

8
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:27,413
>> Martha: TONIGHT MARKS 50

9
00:00:27,413 --> 00:00:29,448
YEARS SINCE THE ASSASSINATION OF

10
00:00:29,448 --> 00:00:29,949
ROBERT F. KENNEDY.

11
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:31,250
THE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR IN THE

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,285
MIDST OF A PRESIDENTIAL BID TO

13
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:34,654
GUNNED IT DOWN AT THE AMBASSADOR

14
00:00:34,654 --> 00:00:37,089
HOTEL IN LOS ANGELES, JUST AFTER

15
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:39,859
THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY AND TWO

16
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:41,027
MONTHS AFTER MARTIN LUTHER KING

17
00:00:41,027 --> 00:00:43,562
JR.'S ASSASSINATION.

18
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:45,164
MY NEXT GUEST HAS BEEN DIGGING

19
00:00:45,164 --> 00:00:47,033
BACK INTO THIS TRAGIC MOMENT IN

20
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:48,367
AMERICAN HISTORY INCLUDING THE

21
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:51,871
SOMBER CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHT THAT

22
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:55,041
CARRIED RFK'S BODY BACK EAST.

23
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,744
ON BOARD, WIDOWS ETHEL KENNEDY,

24
00:00:58,744 --> 00:01:01,047
JACQUELINE KENNEDY AND

00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:02,948
CORETTA SCOTT KING.

JOINING ME NOW, DAVID MARGO LIKL

33
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:17,063
DISCUSS THIS FASCINATING TOPIC.

34
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:18,931
DAVID, NICE TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.

35
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:21,067
>> NICE TO SEE YOU, MARTHA.

36
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:22,668
>> Martha: IF THERE IS SO MUCH

37
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:24,070
SYMBOLISM AND YET THE REALITY

38
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,337
THAT THESE THREE WOMEN FLEW BACK

39
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:29,075
ON A PLANE TOGETHER AFTER BOBBY

40
00:01:29,075 --> 00:01:30,376
KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION, HOW DO

41
00:01:30,376 --> 00:01:32,878
WE KNOW WHAT THEY DID AND WHAT

42
00:01:32,878 --> 00:01:33,579
THEY SET ON THAT FLIGHT?

43
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:35,381
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST THE

44
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:36,916
MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING THAT

45
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,884
THESE THREE WOMEN WERE ON THAT

46
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:40,720
FLIGHT AND NO ONE HAD WRITTEN

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,520
ABOUT IT BEFORE.

48
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,689
I MENTIONED IT IN MY BOOK BUT I

49
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,124
WANTED TO GO EVEN FURTHER THAN

50
00:01:45,124 --> 00:01:45,424
THAT.

51
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:48,360
SO I DUG DOWN VERY DEEP.

52
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,795
I TALKED TO THE ONLY SURVIVING

53
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:50,830
SECRET SERVICE MAN WHO WAS ON

54
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,264
THE FLIGHT.

55
00:01:52,264 --> 00:01:53,566
I TALKED TO ANY PASSENGERS I

56
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:54,834
COULD FIND WHO WERE STILL

57
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:58,871
AROUND, AND THERE WAS ONE MOMENT

58
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:00,339
WHEN THESE THREE WOMEN WERE

59
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:01,107
ACTUALLY STANDING OR SITTING IN

60
00:02:01,107 --> 00:02:04,610
THE SAME PLACE ON THE FLIGHT AND

61
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,478
TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER.

62
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:06,479
WE WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT THEY

63
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,947
SAID THAT WE CAN ONLY IMAGINE

64
00:02:07,947 --> 00:02:10,049
THE KIND OF COMMISERATING THAT

65
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:14,987
WENT ON.

66
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:20,259
THEY CLEARLY SHARED SOMETHING

67
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:21,060
THAT THEY COULD SHARE.

68
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,864
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE TRAGIC

69
00:02:24,864 --> 00:02:27,266
SENSE THAT THAT PLANE OR ACROSS

70
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:29,502
THE COUNTRY WITH THESE THREE

71
00:02:29,502 --> 00:02:32,271
WOMEN ON IT.

72
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:32,972
JACKIE BOARDED THE PLANE IN A

73
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:34,106
SEPARATE AREA AND SHE WANTED TO

74
00:02:34,106 --> 00:02:35,808
KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE SAME

75
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:40,479
PLANE THAT CARRIED HER BACK FROM

76
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:40,880
DALLAS?

77
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,381
>> IS PUZZLING AND ANOTHER

78
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:44,683
MYSTERY TO THE STORY THAT ALL OF

79
00:02:44,683 --> 00:02:46,285
THE FAMILY GOT ON THE FRONT OF

80
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:47,686
THE PLANE WITH THE CASKET AND

81
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:49,054
SURROUNDED THE CASKET AND HELD

82
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:51,657
HANDS AS IT WAS LIFTED INTO THE

83
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:53,893
FRONT OF THE PLANE.

84
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:54,627
THEN JACQUELINE KENNEDY ENTERED

85
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:56,262
FROM THE REAR END AND FOR

86
00:02:56,262 --> 00:02:57,563
WHATEVER REASON SHE WASN'T PART

87
00:02:57,563 --> 00:02:58,464
OF THE FAMILY UNIT.

88
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:01,200
SHE SORT OF WENT IN THERE AND

89
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,101
MADE A VERY SEPARATE ENTRANCE.

90
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:04,503
SHE GOT ON THE PLANE AS YOU SAY

91
00:03:04,503 --> 00:03:06,705
ONLY AFTER SHE WAS ASSURED THAT

92
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:07,840
IT WAS NOT THE SAME

93
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,475
AIR FORCE ONE.

94
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:10,142
THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT

95
00:03:10,142 --> 00:03:10,609
AIR FORCE ONES.

96
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:11,610
SHE HAD TO BE ASSURED THAT IT

97
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,546
WAS NOT THE SAME ONE THAT

98
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:16,081
BROUGHT HER BACK WITH HER

99
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:17,416
HUSBAND'S BODY FROM DALLAS.

100
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,585
AND THERE WAS ONE MOMENT WHEN

101
00:03:19,585 --> 00:03:22,488
SHE WOULDN'T GET OUT OF THE CAR

102
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:25,891
UNTIL SHE GOT THAT ASSURANCE.

103
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:31,030
AND >> Martha: WHAT ABOUT THE

104
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,898
RELATIONSHIP OF RFK JR. WHO ALSO

105
00:03:32,898 --> 00:03:35,968
APPROVED THE WIRETAPS ON HIM?

106
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:39,872
>> WELL, IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED

107
00:03:39,872 --> 00:03:41,640
RELATIONSHIP.

108
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,943
THERE IS THE SONG ABRAHAM,

109
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:46,145
MARTIN AND JOHN AND WE LIKE TO

110
00:03:46,145 --> 00:03:48,314
THINK THAT THESE GUYS ARE TIED

111
00:03:48,314 --> 00:03:49,481
TOGETHER BUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP

112
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:51,183
WAS MUCH ROCKIER THAN THAT AND

113
00:03:51,183 --> 00:03:52,084
MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

114
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:54,720
THEY WERE DEPENDENT UPON EACH

115
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,322
OTHER, THEY RESENTED EACH OTHER

116
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:58,724
AND THEY INTERACTED ALL OF THE

117
00:03:58,724 --> 00:04:01,060
TIME, NOT LITERALLY DIRECTLY,

118
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,594
THERE IS VERY LITTLE

119
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:02,394
CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THEM.

120
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:06,899
BUT THERE IS NOT EVEN A GOOD

121
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:09,935
PHOTOGRAPH OF MARTIN LUTHER KING

122
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:10,970
AND ROBERT KENNEDY ALONE

123
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,570
TOGETHER.

124
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,839
THEY WERE VITAL TO ONE ANOTHER'S

125
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:15,541
INTERESTS AND THEY WERE

126
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,375
COMPLETELY INTERDEPENDENT

127
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,177
REALLY, AND THAT'S THE STORY IN

128
00:04:18,177 --> 00:04:20,379
THE BOOK THAT I WAS EXPLORING.

129
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:23,816
>> Martha: BEFORE I LET YOU

130
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:25,784
GO, YOU SAID WE HAVE TO BE

131
00:04:25,784 --> 00:04:26,919
CAREFUL NOT TO CANONIZE THEM.

132
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,255
>> WHILE I THINK IT'S GOOD TO

133
00:04:29,255 --> 00:04:31,457
RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO

134
00:04:31,457 --> 00:04:32,258
CANONIZE ANYBODY.

135
00:04:32,258 --> 00:04:33,259
ROBERT KENNEDY IS MORE

136
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:35,461
INTERESTING IN FACT BECAUSE HE

137
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:38,264
WASN'T THE SAINT AND BECAUSE OF

138
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:40,065
HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD RACE AND

139
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:41,567
KING VARIED AND EVOLVED OVER THE

140
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:42,501
YEARS.

141
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:45,671
HE HAD HIS MOMENTS, HE HAD HIS

142
00:04:45,671 --> 00:00:00,000
RELAPSES.
