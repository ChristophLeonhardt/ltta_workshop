the information and the evidence that we
have so far collected indicate that
Jamal Khashoggi was slain in a vicious
violent murder whitewashing such
barbarity will of course injured and
boond the conscience of all humanity and
we are of course looking forward to the
same sensitivity being demonstrated by
the administration of Saudi Arabia and
all other parties to this affair dear
friends the Saudi Arabian administration
took an important step by acknowledging
and admitting the murder and now our
expectation from them going forward is
that all those responsible from the
highest degree Thais level to the lowest
level will be highlighted will be
brought to justice
