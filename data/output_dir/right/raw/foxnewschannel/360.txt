00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:05,448
>> Tucker: GOOD EVENING.

2
00:00:05,449 --> 00:00:06,816
WELCOME TO "TUCKER CARLSON

3
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:07,183
TONIGHT."

4
00:00:07,184 --> 00:00:10,086
THE MONTH-LONG SAGA TURNED

5
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:11,287
NIGHTMARE OF BRETT KAVANAUGH’S

6
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:12,488
SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION

7
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:14,757
PROCESS FINALLY COMING TO A

8
00:00:14,758 --> 00:00:15,158
CONCLUSION.

9
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:16,726
THE SENATE VOTED NARROWLY TODAY

10
00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:18,428
TO MOVE THE DECISION TO THE

11
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:18,728
FLOOR.

12
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:20,196
THAT MEANS THE FINAL VOTE ON

13
00:00:20,197 --> 00:00:21,631
THIS, ON KAVANAUGH, WILL TAKE

14
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:22,866
PLACE TOMORROW.

15
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:24,367
PROBABLY TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

16
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:27,003
THIS IS ALMOST OVER.

17
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:28,772
DEMOCRATS MADE ONE FINAL PUSH

18
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:31,274
AGAINST KAVANAUGH THIS AFTERNOON

19
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:35,445
SCREAMING PROTESTERS SWARMED THE
AGAINST KAVANAUGH THIS AFTERNOON

20
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:35,446
SCREAMING PROTESTERS SWARMED THE

21
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:36,913
CAPITOL.

22
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:38,882
FAMOUS JOURNALISTS WENT CRAZY ON

23
00:00:38,883 --> 00:00:40,350
TWITTER AND DIANNE FEINSTEIN,

24
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:42,252
THE 85-YEAR-OLD RANKING DEMOCRAT

25
00:00:42,253 --> 00:00:45,655
ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY

26
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:46,523
COMMITTEE, SOMEONE LONG HOLDING

27
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:47,924
A REPUTATION FOR BEING

28
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:49,526
REASONABLE ABANDONED THAT

29
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:51,061
REPUTATION AND WENT ALL THE WAY.

30
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:53,230
SHE SUGGESTED THAT BRETT

31
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:54,565
KAVANAUGH ISN’T SIMPLY A BAD

32
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:56,633
NOMINEE OR A BAD JURIST, BUT

33
00:00:56,634 --> 00:00:58,168
HE’S A VIOLENT AND DANGEROUS

34
00:00:58,169 --> 00:00:58,635
PERSON.

35
00:00:58,636 --> 00:00:59,837
HERE’S PART OF IT.

36
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:03,073
>> AT THE HEARING LAST WEEK, WE

37
00:01:03,074 --> 00:01:07,311
SAW A MAN FILLED WITH ANGER AND
>> AT THE HEARING LAST WEEK, WE

38
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:07,312
SAW A MAN FILLED WITH ANGER AND

39
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:07,911
AGGRESSION.

40
00:01:07,912 --> 00:01:09,580
JUDGE KAVANAUGH RAISED HIS

41
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:11,148
VOICE, HE INTERRUPTED SENATORS,

42
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:14,385
THIS BEHAVIOR REVEALED A

43
00:01:14,386 --> 00:01:15,653
HOSTILITY AND BELLIGERENCE THAT

44
00:01:15,654 --> 00:01:18,656
IS UNBECOMING OF SOMEONE SEEKING
HOSTILITY AND BELLIGERENCE THAT

45
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:18,657
IS UNBECOMING OF SOMEONE SEEKING

46
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:21,125
TO BE ELEVATED TO THE UNITED

47
00:01:21,126 --> 00:01:23,160
STATES SUPREME COURT.

48
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:26,097
>> Tucker: LOCK THAT MAN UP!

49
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:28,399
FOR MUCH OF THE DAY, BRETT

50
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,067
KAVANAUGH’S FATE SEEMED

51
00:01:30,068 --> 00:01:30,434
UNCERTAIN.

52
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:33,371
LISA MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA VOTED

53
00:01:33,372 --> 00:01:34,071
WITH THE DEMOCRATS.

54
00:01:34,072 --> 00:01:36,407
THEN SHE ISSUED A BIZARRE

55
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:37,708
STATEMENT IN WHICH SHE SAID THAT

56
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:40,545
KAVANAUGH IS A GOOD MAN, BUT

57
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:41,746
SHOULD NOT BE ON THE SUPREME

58
00:01:41,747 --> 00:01:43,614
COURT.

59
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:45,316
IN OTHER WORDS, BRETT

60
00:01:45,317 --> 00:01:48,686
KAVANAUGH’S WAS FALSELY ACCUSED

61
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:53,491
OF GANG RAPE AND THAT MEANS HE

62
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:55,260
CAN BE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

63
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:56,895
KEEP IN MIND, THAT LISA

64
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:58,963
MURKOWSKI IS AN ACTUAL U.S.

65
00:01:58,964 --> 00:01:59,297
SENATOR.

66
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:00,999
HARD TO BELIEVE BUT TRUE.

67
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,634
AND IN THE MID AFTERNOON,

68
00:02:02,635 --> 00:02:03,635
SOMETHING REMARKABLE HAPPENED.

69
00:02:03,636 --> 00:02:05,370
SOMETHING THAT VERY FEW

70
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:06,371
EXPECTED.

71
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:08,173
SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE,

72
00:02:08,174 --> 00:02:10,442
ONE OF THE MOST LIBERAL

73
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:12,277
REPUBLICANS IN WASHINGTON AND

74
00:02:12,278 --> 00:02:15,046
NOT FAMOUS FOR ORATORY, TOOK TO

75
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:16,548
THE FLOOR TO MOUNT A LOGICAL

76
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:17,949
DEFENSE OF KAVANAUGH’S

77
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,251
CHARACTER, ABILITY AND

78
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:19,718
NOMINATION.

79
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,487
HERE’S PART OF WHAT SHE SAID.

80
00:02:22,488 --> 00:02:26,224
>> THE FACTS PRESENTED DO NOT

81
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:31,196
MEAN THAT PROFESSOR FORD WAS NOT

82
00:02:31,197 --> 00:02:34,500
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THAT NIGHT OR
MEAN THAT PROFESSOR FORD WAS NOT

83
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:37,669
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THAT NIGHT ORAT SOME OTHER TIME, BUT THEY DO

84
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,670
AT SOME OTHER TIME, BUT THEY DO

85
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,773
LEAD ME TO CONCLUDE THAT THE

86
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:43,776
ALLEGATIONS FAILED TO MEET THE

87
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:48,147
MORE LIKELY THAN NOT STANDARD.

88
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:50,716
THESE CHARGES CAN FAIRLY PREVENT

89
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:55,421
THEREFORE, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT

90
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:57,990
THESE CHARGES CAN FAIRLY PREVENTJUDGE KAVANAUGH FROM SERVING ON

91
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:57,991
JUDGE KAVANAUGH FROM SERVING ON

92
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:59,058
THE COURT.

93
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:02,595
MR. PRESIDENT, I WILL VOTE TO

94
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:04,463
CONFIRM JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

95
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:05,097
THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

96
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:08,367
[APPLAUSE]

97
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:10,136
>> Tucker: THIS WAS NOT AN

98
00:03:10,137 --> 00:03:11,103
EMOTIONAL SPEECH.

99
00:03:11,104 --> 00:03:13,339
FOR THAT REASON, IT WAS VERY

100
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,607
DIFFERENT FROM VIRTUALLY

101
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:15,842
ANYTHING WE’VE HEARD THE PAST

102
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:16,342
MONTH.

103
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:17,910
IT WAS AN ARGUMENT ROOTED IN

104
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:18,244
REASON.

105
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:19,679
IT HAD A HUGE EFFECT.

106
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,647
THE DAM BROKE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY

107
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:22,348
AFTER.

108
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:23,316
WEST VIRGINIA DEMOCRAT JOE

109
00:03:23,317 --> 00:03:25,084
MANCHIN ANNOUNCED THAT HE TOO

110
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:27,453
WILL SUPPORT KAVANAUGH.

111
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:29,255
MANCHIN GIVES THE NOMINATIONS

112
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:30,957
THE NECESSARY 50 VOTES.

113
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,426
EVEN IF PROTESTERS FIND JEFF

114
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:36,429
FLAKE, THE NOMINATION WILL GO

115
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:36,796
THROUGH.

116
00:03:36,797 --> 00:03:38,231
BARRING AN UNFORESEEN EVENT AND

117
00:03:38,232 --> 00:03:41,935
THAT COULD HAPPEN, BUT IF IT

118
00:03:41,936 --> 00:03:42,669
DOESN’T, BRETT KAVANAUGH WILL

119
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,672
BECOME A JUSTICE THIS WEEKEND.

120
00:03:45,673 --> 00:03:50,610
FOR REPRESENTING HIS VOTERS IN

121
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:52,779
VIRGINIA THAT OVERWHELMINGLY

122
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,814
SUPPORT KAVANAUGH, THE YOUTH

123
00:03:54,815 --> 00:03:56,416
RING OF THINKS PARTY RICHLY

124
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:57,818
DENOUNCED HIM IN THE HALLS OF

125
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:58,718
THE CAPITOL.

126
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,554
NOBODY TRIED TO STOP THEM OR

127
00:04:00,555 --> 00:04:02,055
ASKED THEM TO BE QUIET BECAUSE

128
00:04:02,056 --> 00:04:05,592
WE’RE GETTING USED TO MOB RULE

129
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:05,992
HERE.

130
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:11,131
WATCH.

131
00:04:11,132 --> 00:04:13,834
[PROTESTERS CHANTING].

132
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:14,935
>> Tucker: THESE KINDS OF SCENES

133
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:18,505
ARE EVERYWHERE IN WASHINGTON

134
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:19,539
TONIGHT, WE’RE SAD TO TELL YOU.

135
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,642
THEIR OWN CASE.

136
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:22,843
THE LEFT HAS GIVEN UP ON MAKING

137
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:24,812
ACTIVISTS NO LONGER TRY TO

138
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:26,780
CONVINCE ANYONE OF ANYTHING.

139
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:28,716
INSTEAD, THEY SCREAM AND BULLY

140
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:31,185
AS A TACTIC THAT CAN BE

141
00:04:31,186 --> 00:04:31,552
EFFECTIVE.

142
00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:33,053
IT WORKED FOR THE MAFIA, FOR

143
00:04:33,054 --> 00:04:33,387
EXAMPLE.

144
00:04:33,388 --> 00:04:34,889
BUT THERE’S A COST TO IT

145
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,624
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT’S ON

146
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,024
TELEVISION.

147
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:39,160
NORMAL PEOPLE FIND IT SCARY AND

148
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:40,161
UNREASONABLE BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT
NORMAL PEOPLE FIND IT SCARY AND

149
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:40,162
UNREASONABLE BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT

150
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:42,696
IT IS, SCARY AND UNREASONABLE.

151
00:04:42,697 --> 00:04:45,032
THE LEFT IS GOING TOO FAR.

152
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:48,336
AND IT’S ALIENATING EVEN LIBERAL

153
00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:50,805
REPUBLICANS LIKE SUSAN COLLINS.

154
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:52,473
>> I AM THINKING IN PARTICULAR

155
00:04:52,474 --> 00:04:55,877
NOT AT THE ALLEGATIONS RAISED BY

156
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,713
PROFESSOR FORD BUT OF THE

157
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:02,150
ALLEGATIONS THAT WHEN HE WAS A

158
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:03,217
TEENAGER, JUDGE KAVANAUGH

159
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:05,954
DRUGGED MULTIPLE GIRLS AND USED

160
00:05:05,955 --> 00:05:09,357
THEIR WEAKENED STATE TO

161
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:12,293
FACILITATE GANG RAPE.

162
00:05:12,294 --> 00:05:15,597
THIS OUTLANDISH ALLEGATION WAS

163
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:19,200
PUT FORTH WITHOUT ANY CREDIBLE

164
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:20,068
SUPPORTING EVIDENCE.

CHANNELS FOR WEEKS.

170
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:30,478
IT WAS, OF COURSE, A FANTASY

171
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,147
PROMOTED BY STORMY DANIELS

172
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:34,182
ATTORNEY, THE WORLD’S CREEPIEST

173
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:36,418
PORN LAWYER, WHO IS A LEADING

174
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,619
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL

CANDIDATE IF THAT TELLS YOU

176
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:40,689
ANYTHING.

177
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,157
HE COULD BE PORN LAWYER LASHED

178
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:44,459
OUT ON COLLINS.

179
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,762
HE CALLED HER SPEECH ENTIRELY

180
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,963
DISINGENUOUS AND SHAMEFUL.

181
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:49,698
BY THIS POINT, EVEN DEMOCRATS

182
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:50,799
WERE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND THAT

183
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,001
THE FREAK SHOW THAT THEY HAVE

184
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:55,270
UNLEASHED IS BEGINNING TO HURT

185
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:55,604
THEM.

KEN VOGEL AT THE "NEW YORK

00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:03,679
THE CREEPY IMPORTANT LAWYER

189
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,347
COULD BE A DOUBLE AGENT, WORKING

190
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:06,982
FOR THE REPUBLICANS.

191
00:06:06,983 --> 00:06:08,317
UNLIKELY BUT HE HELPED THEM.

192
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:10,920
IN THE FIELD, THEY NEVER GOT THE

193
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:11,220
MEMO.

194
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:14,523
ONE ABOUT TRYING TO SEE NONCRAZY

195
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:15,991
FOR THE SAKE OF SCARING THE

196
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:16,325
VOTERS.

197
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:18,160
MANY ON THE LEFT ATTACKED SUSAN

198
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:20,095
COLLINS FOR THE COLOR OF HER

199
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:20,663
SKIN.

200
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:22,398
"SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS IS THE

201
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,700
MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER OF WHITE

202
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:28,638
WOMEN IN AMERICA THAT GAVE US A
MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER OF WHITE

203
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:28,639
WOMEN IN AMERICA THAT GAVE US A

204
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,939
DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENCY."

205
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,010
WHAT THAT MEANS, THEY’RE SAYING

206
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:34,277
IT.

207
00:06:34,278 --> 00:06:37,180
AT G.Q., A WRITER WROTE THIS.

208
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:39,682
IF I DIE OF GETTING IN AN

209
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:41,951
ILLEGAL ABORTION, DROP MY BODY

210
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:43,519
OFF AFTER SENATOR COLLINS’ HOUSE

211
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,787
AND LOT IT ROT.

212
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:46,522
IF THERE’S ONE THING I LEARNED

213
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:48,224
IS WHAT THE ACTIVIST LEFT IS

214
00:06:48,225 --> 00:06:49,125
REALLY THINGS.

215
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:50,526
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SCARED BY

216
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:52,028
WHAT THEY THINK.

217
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:54,531
ACTUALLY THE TERM "THINK" MAY BE

218
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:55,532
TOO GENEROUS.

219
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:57,600
A LOT OF WHAT WE’RE HEARING IS

220
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:58,868
NOT A PRODUCT OF THINKING.

221
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:01,104
IT A PRODUCT OF COORDINATED

222
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:02,505
INSTRUCTIONS HANDED DOWN FROM ON

223
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,408
HIGH AND DUTIFULLY REPEATED BY

224
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:06,309
ANGRY CHILDREN.

225
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,477
LIBERALS ARE PARTY PEOPLE.

226
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:09,579
THEY DO EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE

227
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,814
TOLD.

228
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:11,982
WATCH THIS SCENE TODAY FROM

229
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:14,551
CAPITOL HILL WHICH SAYS IT ALL.

230
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:16,052
>> LET’S GO WATCH THE VOTE.

231
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:31,235
>> LET’S DO WATCH THE VOTE.

232
00:07:31,236 --> 00:07:33,470
[INAUDIBLE]

233
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:35,205
>> Tucker: REPEAT AFTER ME!

234
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:37,808
LIKE THE LITTLE ROBOTS THEY ARE,

235
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:38,609
THEY DO.

236
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,511
DURING HER SPEECH, SUSAN COLLINS

237
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:41,345
NOTED THAT SUPREME COURT

238
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:43,247
NOMINATION BATTLES HAVE BEEN

239
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:44,481
STEADILY ANGRIER AND MORE

240
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:47,284
VICIOUS OVER THE COURSE OF 30

241
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:47,584
YEARS.

242
00:07:47,585 --> 00:07:48,819
SHE SAYS SHE HOPES WHAT HAPPENED

243
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,987
TO BRETT KAVANAUGH IS ROCK

244
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:52,189
BOTTOM AND GETS BETTER FROM

245
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:52,489
HERE.

246
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,391
OF COURSE, WE AND A LOT OF OTHER

247
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:55,593
PEOPLE HOPE SHE’S RIGHT.

248
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:57,428
WE WORRY THAT SHE ISN’T.

249
00:07:57,429 --> 00:07:59,296
THE EFFORT TO DESTROYED BRETT

250
00:07:59,297 --> 00:08:01,065
KAVANAUGH’S LIFE FAILED,

251
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:01,499
APPARENTLY.

252
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,633
BUT ONLY BARELY.

253
00:08:02,634 --> 00:08:04,301
NOBODY IMPORTANT SEEMS TO REGRET

254
00:08:04,302 --> 00:08:05,636
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

255
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:07,104
NORMS LIKE THE PRESUMPTION OF

256
00:08:07,105 --> 00:08:08,506
INNOCENCE AND BASIC FAIRNESS,

257
00:08:08,507 --> 00:08:10,675
THE ONES THIS COUNTRY IS BUILT

258
00:08:10,676 --> 00:08:12,643
ON, REMAIN INTACT BUT THEY’VE

259
00:08:12,644 --> 00:08:13,477
BEEN DAMAGED.

260
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:16,047
THEY MAY CRUMBLE IF THEY’RE

261
00:08:16,048 --> 00:08:16,614
ATTACKED A AGAIN.

262
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:17,381
WILL THEY BE?

263
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:19,350
THAT DEPENDS ON VOTERS.

264
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:21,986
IF VOTERS REWARD MOB JUSTICE IN

265
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:23,087
NOVEMBER, THE SCREAMING ROBOTS

266
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:24,789
YOU SAW ON THE SCREEN, WE’RE

267
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,591
GOING TO GET MORE OF US BECAUSE

268
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:27,992
THAT’S THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS.
GOING TO GET MORE OF US BECAUSE

269
00:08:27,993 --> 00:08:27,993
THAT’S THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS.

270
00:08:27,993 --> 00:08:30,528
IF VOTERS REJECT IT, THE

271
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:32,063
DEMOCRATS MAY RETHINK THE

272
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:33,297
STRATEGY AND GET BACK TO ARGUING

273
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,700
ON BEHALF OF WHAT THEY SAY THEY
STRATEGY AND GET BACK TO ARGUING

274
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:35,701
ON BEHALF OF WHAT THEY SAY THEY

275
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:36,034
BELIEVE.

276
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:37,901
WHICH WOULD BE A MASSIVE

277
00:08:37,903 --> 00:08:39,070
IMPROVEMENT OVER SENDING OUT

278
00:08:39,071 --> 00:00:00,000
THEIR YOUTH WING TO SCREAM AT
