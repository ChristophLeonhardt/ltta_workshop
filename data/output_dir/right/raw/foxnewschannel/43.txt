00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:17,822
IN THE WAKE OF INCREASINGLY

10
00:00:17,823 --> 00:00:22,127
UNCIVIL POLITICAL RHETORIC, THE

O'CONNOR SAYS CALLING HER WORK

15
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,002
IN CIVICS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT.

16
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:32,370
"WE MUST REACH OUR YOUTH.

17
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:33,705
IT'S TIME TO MAKE CIVIC LEARNING

JAY O'CONNOR IS HERE WITH MORE

22
00:00:40,312 --> 00:00:42,480

WELCOME.

24
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:44,816
CAN YOU TELL US HOW SHE'S DOING,

25
00:00:44,817 --> 00:00:46,017
HOW YOU ARE ALL DOING.

26
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:47,519
THIS IS A VERY BRAVE LETTER AND

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,187
I'M SURE NOT AN EASY ONE FOR HER

28
00:00:49,188 --> 00:00:49,721
TO WRITE.

29
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:50,922
>> WELL, THIS IS A BIG MOMENT

30
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:54,826
FOR MY MOM TO BE OPEN ABOUT WHAT

31
00:00:54,827 --> 00:00:55,627
HER CONDITION IS.

32
00:00:55,628 --> 00:00:57,128
THERE HAD BEEN A LOT OF

33
00:00:57,129 --> 00:00:57,896
INQUIRIES, PEOPLE WOULD NOTICED

34
00:00:57,897 --> 00:01:00,432
SHE WAS LESS ACTIVE IN PUBLIC

35
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:00,732
LIFE.

36
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:01,499
SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST TO

37
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,300
BE DIRECTED PEOPLE AND SHARE

38
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:04,769
WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH HER

MEDICAL CONDITION.

40
00:01:05,638 --> 00:01:06,571
WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH THE

41
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:07,172
TRANSITION IN HER LIFE.

00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:16,981
"SHATTERING GLASS CEILING AFTER

47
00:01:16,982 --> 00:01:18,183
GLASS CEILING, SHE SHOWED HOW

48
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:21,152
WOMEN COULD TAKE PART AS

49
00:01:21,153 --> 00:01:21,820
EQUALS."

50
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:23,521
RUTH BADER GINSBURG SAYING "SHE

51
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:24,956
STRIVE MIGHTILY TO MAKE A

52
00:01:24,957 --> 00:01:27,826
MOMENTOUS MOMENT FOR WOMEN IN

53
00:01:27,827 --> 00:01:28,593
1981 NO LONGER EXTRAORDINARY BUT

54
00:01:28,594 --> 00:01:30,628
ENTIRELY EXPECTABLE.

55
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:32,530
I AM AMONG LEGIONS OF WOMEN

56
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:36,000

STATEMENT FROM HER BUT SHE

60
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:40,638
DOCKED ABOUT HOW THE FACT THAT

61
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:42,240
SHE'S ON THE BOARD OF CIVICS, A

62
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:43,808
GROUP YOUR MOTHER STARTED.

63
00:01:43,809 --> 00:01:46,811
TO MAKE SURE ALL OF US HAVE A

64
00:01:46,812 --> 00:01:49,080
BETTER EDUCATION ABOUT HOW OUR

65
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:50,982
COUNTRY WORKS AND RUNS ON WHY

66
00:01:50,983 --> 00:01:51,716
IT'S IMPORTANT WE WOULD ACTUALLY

67
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:53,985
UNDERSTAND IT.

68
00:01:53,986 --> 00:01:56,788
>> YES.

69
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,489
MY MOTHER WAS VERY CONCERNED

70
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,925
AFTER RETIRING FROM THE COURT

71
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:02,527
ABOUT THE STATE OF CIVIC

72
00:02:02,528 --> 00:02:04,095
KNOWLEDGE THAT MOST AMERICANS

73
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:04,395
FACE.

74
00:02:04,396 --> 00:02:11,736
AND UNDERSTAND.

75
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:12,470
LITERALLY ONE-THIRD OF AMERICANS

76
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:13,138
CAN ACTUALLY NAME ALL THREE

77
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:13,738
BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.

78
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:14,773
SHE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

79
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:15,039
IT.

80
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,209
AT AGE 79, SHE STARTED AN

81
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:18,910
EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE COMPANY

82
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:24,315
THAT'S ALL ABOUT TEACHING OF

83
00:02:24,316 --> 00:02:25,483
CIVICS IN AN EXCITING WAY FOR

84
00:02:25,484 --> 00:02:30,588
YOUNG PEOPLE, USING INTERACTIVE

85
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:31,523
GAMES.

THE COUNTRY FROM GRADES FIVE

91
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:43,001
THROUGH 12.

92
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:45,036
A REMARKABLE SOLUTION.

93
00:02:45,037 --> 00:02:45,737
>> Shannon: FANTASTIC LEGACY

94
00:02:45,738 --> 00:02:47,806
IN ADDITION TO ALL THE WORK SHE

95
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:49,541
DID ON THE COURTS.

96
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:50,842
WE CHECKED INTO THE NUMBERS.

97
00:02:50,843 --> 00:02:53,044
ANNENBERG DOES THIS EVERY YEAR.

98
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:54,312
37% OF AMERICANS THEY SURVEYED

99
00:02:54,313 --> 00:02:56,447
COULDN'T NAME ANY OF THE RIGHTS

100
00:02:56,448 --> 00:02:57,649
GUARANTEED UNDER THE

101
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,116
FIRST AMENDMENT.

102
00:02:58,117 --> 00:02:59,017
THIS ISN'T SOME OBSCURE

103
00:02:59,018 --> 00:02:59,617
AMENDMENT.

104
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:01,019
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

105
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,653
FIRST AMENDMENT.

106
00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:02,987
26% CAN NAME ALL THREE BRANCHES

107
00:03:02,988 --> 00:03:05,990
OF GOVERNMENT.

108
00:03:05,991 --> 00:03:08,293
AS A FELLOW AMERICAN, I FIND

109
00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:09,794
THAT TERRIFYING.

110
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:11,396
>> ABSOLUTELY, AND SO DID MY MOM

111
00:03:11,397 --> 00:03:12,630
AND THAT'S WHY SHE WANTED TO DO

112
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:13,965
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

113
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:15,767
THERE IS A GREAT SOLUTION AT

114
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:16,401
HAND.

115
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:18,770
SHE SAID IN HER LETTER TODAY, IN

116
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:21,406
ADDITION TO SHARING THE NEWS

117
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:22,674
ABOUT HER MEDICAL CONDITION, SHE

118
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:24,175
WANTED TO USE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

119
00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:25,009
UNDERLINE HOW IMPORTANT SHE

120
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,978
FEELS IT IS FOR OUR COUNTRY TO

121
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:27,512
ADDRESS THE ISSUE.

122
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:31,883
IT CAN'T BE SOLVED, AND HOW CAN

123
00:03:31,884 --> 00:03:34,018
WE EFFECTIVELY GOVERN OUR

124
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,220
COUNTRY AND HOW CAN OUR CITIZENS

125
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:37,789
CHOOSE THE RIGHT REPRESENTATIVES

126
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,790
UNLESS I HAVE A BASIC

127
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:39,591
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR COUNTRY

128
00:03:39,592 --> 00:03:41,993
WORK, HOW THE GOVERNMENT WORKS

129
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:42,994
AND HOW THE CONSTITUTION IS

130
00:03:42,995 --> 00:03:45,430
DESIGNED AND SOME OTHER FOUNDING

131
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,798
PRINCIPLES OF THE COUNTRY.

132
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,199
BY SHARING THE COMMON

133
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,400
UNDERSTANDING AND THOSE,

134
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:51,002
FOUNDATIONS, IT CAN ALLOW US ALL

135
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:52,203
TO WORK MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY

136
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:52,704
AND PRODUCTIVELY.

138
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:56,274
OF THIS MISINFORMATION DOES LEAD

139
00:03:56,275 --> 00:04:00,411
TO SOME OF THE RHETORIC AND THE

140
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:00,979
SNIPING AND THE HEATED

141
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,447
PARTISANSHIP AND BACK-AND-FORTH

142
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:03,414
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT

143
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:05,283
FROM THOSE SHARED THINGS ARE

144
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:06,384
VERY SPECIAL AS AMERICANS.

OUR COMMON HERITAGE AND THE

148
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:14,158
VALUES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT,

149
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,995
WE CAN RE-ENERGIZE AMERICANS TO

150
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:18,862
REALIZE THAT WE ARE ALL ON THE

151
00:04:18,863 --> 00:04:20,864
SAME TEAM AND WE CAN ALL ACHIEVE

TOGETHER.

154
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:24,035
MY MOM STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT

155
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:26,004
YOU DON'T GET ANYWHERE BY

156
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:27,238
YELLING AT ONE ANOTHER, AND

157
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,406
THAT'S TRUE OF BOTH SIDES.
