SLEEP DEPRIVATION, WHICH COULD 
CAUSE DEMENTIA, 10 OR 20 YEARS 
FROM NOW, TO WHERE I WOULD NOT 
EVEN REMEMBER MY SON'S NAME. 
I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REMEMBER 
HIS NAME FROM A MIXED DIAGNOSIS.
WE CAN EMPOWER THE 
PHARMACEUTICALS AND MAKE MORE 
MONEY. 
I HAVE NEVER STEPPED INTO A 
SITUATION WHERE I DIDN'T MAKE 
PEOPLE MORE MONEY. 
WE CAN EMPOWER PHARMACEUTICALS, 
EMPOWER INDUSTRY. 
EMPOWER FACTORIES. 
NOT ONLY BRING ADIDAS ONSHORE, 
BUT FOX CAN'T SET UP A FACTORY 
DAY 
>> IN WISCONSIN. 
WISCONSIN. 
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED IS 
FOR FORD TO HAVE THE BEST 
DESIGN, THE DOPE LIST CARS. 
I DON'T USUALLY SAY DOPE. 
I LIKE TO FLIP THEM. 
THE MOST AMAZING CAR. 
WHAT WE WANT TO START WITH, I 
BROUGHT THIS WITH ME, RIGHT 
HERE. 
THIS IS A HYDROGEN POWERED 
AIRPLANE. 
THIS IS WHAT OUR PRESIDENT 
SHOULD BE FLYING IN. 
LOOK AT THIS. 
>> CAN WE GET RID OF AIR FORCE 
ONE? 
I LIKE THAT. 
>> WE WILL HAVE APPLE, AN 
AMERICAN COMPANY, WORK ON THIS 
AIRPLANE WITH US. 
WHAT I NEED SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 
TO IMPROVE ON, IF HE DON'T LOOK 
GOOD, WE DON'T LOOK GOOD. 
THIS IS OUR PRESIDENT. 
HE HAS TO BE THE FRESHEST, THE 
FLY ASKED. 
THE BEST FACTORIES. 
WE HAVE TO EMPOWER OR CORE. 
WE HAVE TO BRING JOBS INTO 
AMERICA, BECAUSE OUR BEST 
EXPORT IS ENTERTAINMENT AND 
IDEAS. 
BUT WHEN WE MAKE EVERYTHING IN 
CHINA AND NOT AMERICA, WE ARE 
CHEATING OUR COUNTRY. 
WE ARE PUTTING PEOPLE IN 
POSITIONS TO HAVE TO DO ILLEGAL 
THINGS AND END UP IN THE PRISON 
SYSTEM. 
>> I TELL YOU WHAT, I HATE TO 
SAY THIS, JIM, DO YOU WANT TO 
SAY SOMETHING? 
HOW DO YOU GO AFTER THAT? 
PLEASE, JIM. 
PLEASE. 
GREAT, RIGHT? 
ISN'T THAT A GREAT SALE? 
IT IS SO TRUE. 
AS A COUNTRY. 
SO TRUE. 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN JIM BROWN 
IMPRESSED BEFORE. 
IT IS TRUE. 
THAT IS AMAZING. 
I WANT TO TELL YOU, IT IS GREAT 
TO HAVE YOU GUYS WITH US. 
WE ARE GOING TO GO AND HAVE 
SOME LUNCH. 
THAT WAS QUITE SOMETHING. 
THAT WAS QUITE SOMETHING. 
IT WAS REALLY, REALLY VERY 
INTERESTING. 
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, CAN WE STILL 
HEAR THE REST OF THIS? 
THIS IS PRESIDENT BUSH THEY ARE 
TALKING ABOUT, CAN WE JUST 
LISTEN? 
>> I THINK WE NEED TO CARE ABOUT
ALL PEOPLE AND I BELIEVE WHEN I 
WENT ON NBC I WAS VERY 
EMOTIONAL AND PROGRAMMED TO 
THINK FROM A VICTIMIZED 
MENTALITY. 
I THINK WITH BLACKS AND AFRICAN-
AMERICANS, WE REALLY GET CAUGHT 
UP IN THE IDEA OF RACISM. IF 
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE LAND, THEY 
SETTLE FOR GRANTS. 
WE WANT TO SUPPORT OBAMA AGAIN, 
WE WANT A BRAND, MORE THAN LAND,
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT 
FEELS TO HAVE OUR OWN LAND, 
OWNERSHIP OF OUR OWN BLOCKS. 
IF YOU DON'T HAVE OWNERSHIP, IT 
IS ALL ABOUT HOW SOMETHING 
LOOKS. 
IT IS ABOUT THE PATINA, NOT THE 
CORE. 
SO WE FOCUS ON WHAT WE ARE 
WEARING OR THE IDEA OF SOMEONE 
BEING RACIST. 
WE TALK ABOUT POLICE MURDERS, 
WHICH WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO. 
WE HAVE TO BRING NOBILITY TO 
THE POLICE OFFICERS. 
POLICE OFFICERS ARE JUST LIKE 
US, BUT THERE IS THIS HATE 
BUILDING. 
THAT IS A MAJOR THING ABOUT 
RACIAL TENSION. 
ALSO, AS BLACK PEOPLE, WE HAVE 
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT 
WE ARE DOING. 
WE KILL EACH OTHER MORE THAN 
POLICE OFFICERS. 
THAT IS NOT SAYING THAT THE 
POLICE OFFICERS ARE NOT AT 
ISSUE, BECAUSE THEY ARE IN A 
POSITION OF POWER, BUT 
SOMETIMES THEY ARE -- IT SHOULD 
NOT BE FORCED VERSUS POWER. 
YOU SHOULDN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO 
DO THAT. 
THEY ARE BEING FORCED TO DO 
THIS, FORCED TO DO THAT. 
WE HAVE TO RELEASE THE LOVE, 
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY 
AND GIVE OPPORTUNITIES. 
A LOT OF TIMES IT IS THE 
OVERALL LACK OF REPARATIONS 
THAT AT ANY GIVEN POINT, WE SAY 
THIS IS RACIST, THIS IS RACIST, 
THIS IS RACIST. 
WE DON'T HAVE REPARATIONS, BUT 
WE HAVE THE 13th AMENDMENT. 
WE NEED TO OPEN THE WHOLE 
CONVERSATION. 
ONE OF THE MOVES THAT I LOVE 
THAT LIBERALS TRY TO DO, A 
LIBERAL WILL TRY TO CONTROL A 
BLACK PERSON THROUGH THE 
CONCEPT OF RACISM, BECAUSE THEY 
KNOW WE ARE PROUD AND EMOTIONAL 
PEOPLE. 
SO WHEN I SAY I LIKE TRUMP, HE 
WILL SAY HE IS RACIST. 
YOU THINK THAT WILL CONTROL ME? 
THAT WON'T STOP NOTHING, AN 
INVISIBLE WALL. 
YOU HAVE ONE QUESTION, LET'S GO 
TO ANOTHER QUESTION. 
I DON'T ANSWER QUESTIONS AND 
SIMPLE SOUND BITES. 
>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
KANYE WEST MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
TALKING ABOUT PRISON REFORM, 
THE 13th AMENDMENT, WHICH 
ABOLISHED SLAVERY IN THE UNITED 
STATES. 
I WANT TO BRING IN CAITLIN HUEY-
BURNS. 
RACISM, PRISON REFORM, 
PRESIDENT BUSH. 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE 
JUST HEARD? 
>> A LOT TO UNPACK AND IT SEEMS 
LIKE THAT CONVERSATION WENT ON 
LONGER. 
THE FACT THAT KANYE WEST IS IN 
THE OVAL OFFICE IS NOT 
SOMETHING NEW FOR THIS 
PRESIDENT, IN TERMS OF HIS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. 
HE WENT TO TRUMP TOWER DURING 
THE TRANSITION TO MEET WITH 
HIM. 
OF COURSE KIM KARDASHIAN MET 
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WAS 
SUCCESSFUL GETTING A CHANGE IN 
THE SENTENCE OF SOMEONE SHE WAS 
ADVOCATING TWO. 
THE PRESIDENT WAS RESPONSIVE TO 
HER AND HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE TO 
KANYE WEST. 
HE POINTS TO KANYE WEST AS AN 
EXAMPLE OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN 
COMMUNITY AND HE LIKES TO TALK 
AT RALLIES ABOUT HOW HE IS 
DOING WELL WITH VARIOUS 
CONSTITUENCIES. 
WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT 
THIS PRESIDENT, FOR A LONG 
TIME, HE WAS PART OF THE 
CELEBRITY CULTURE. 
OFTENTIMES NOW THAT HE IS 
OFFICIALLY INVOLVED IN 
POLITICS, HE HAS BEEN STUNNED 
BY THAT COMMUNITY AND 
CELEBRITIES HAVE BEEN VERY 
ACTIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE, 
OPPOSING TRUMP. 
SO HE OFTEN POINTS TO KANYE 
WEST OR OTHERS WHO HAVE COME 
OUT IN SUPPORT OF HIM TO COMBAT 
THE CRITICISM THAT HE DOES GET 
FROM MOST OF HOLLYWOOD. 
>> A LOT THERE. 
CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS, I WANT TO 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. 
>>> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN.
