A COMPANY HAS JUST
PROPOSED A NEW TYPE OF SEATING
ARRANGEMENT THAT SOME AIRLINES
MIGHT LIKE THAT THERE IS NOT AN
AIRLINE THAT MENTION THEY WILL
DO THIS BUT AVIOINTERIORS HAS
COME UP WITH STANDING UP AIRLINE
Ã± AIRPLANE SEATS.
THEY LOOK LIKE
THE TYPES OF SEATS YOU WOULD SEE
ON A ROLLER COASTER.
THEY LOOK
INCREDIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE AND
THEY BRAG ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT
WILL HELP AIRLINES SQUEEZE IN
MORE PASSENGERS.
THEY SAY THEY
CAN FIT UP TO 20% MORE PEOPLE ON
A PLANE SHOULD AIRLINE COMPANIES
DECIDE TO INCORPORATE THESE
SEATS ON THEIR PLANES.
>>THEY THROW IN THE FREE PUNCH
IN THE FACE JUST FOR KICKS.
EVENTUALLY THEY WILL TURN THE
SEATS THIS WAY SO THEY WILL HAVE
ROWS OF UP LINED UP, KIND OF
LIKE HOW SOME OF US GOT HERE IN
THE FIRST PLACE.
ARE THERE NO
BOUNDS OF REASON?
WE ARE NOT
EVEN ALLOWED TO SIT ANYMORE ON
PLANES?
MADNESS.
I VOTE NO.
