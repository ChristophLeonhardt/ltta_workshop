everyone thinks so but I would never say I want to get it finished the prize I want is victory for the world not for even here I want victory for the world cuz that's what we're talking about so that's the only prize I wanted we're seeing the dangers tonight of getting out ahead of a summit with a volatile adversary just a short time ago you may have seen the breaking news graphic at the bottom of our screen the Reuters news agency reported quote North Korea said it may reconsider holding a summit with the United States if Washington continues to unilaterally insist on North Korea giving up its nuclear program the North's state media said on Wednesday North Korea's Central News Agency is there any other also said the fate of the u.s. North Korea summit as well as bilateral relations would be clear if Washington speaks of a Libya style denuclearization for the north the statement added US President Donald Trump would remain as a failed president if he follows in the steps of his predecessors this comes just hours after North Korea pulled out of its high-level talks with the south and made an earlier threat to that June 12th summit there apparently angered by the ongoing long-scheduled by the way joint us-south Korean military drills Pentagon released a statement today saying the exercises are defensive in nature and part of a routine annual training program earlier today State Department said preparations for the summit are still under way and the north has not notified the u.s. of any official change well let's talk about it with two of our experts tonight Anita Kumar White House correspondent for McClatchy Newspapers and Joe Cirincione president of Ploughshares fund and author of the appropriately titled nuclear nightmares securing the world before it's too late on that note Joe a lot of folks we've had this conversation the three of us have on this broadcast we've been walking around the US has talking in advance about denuclearizing North Korea and on shows like this guests like you have said you know good luck with that it's been a great expense there people are eating dirt so they have the money to afford a nuclear program the question to you Joe is this a real threat to the summit or is this just the right flank the hardliners under Kim jong-un making their presence known that's exactly I believe it's the latter of Brian and you know we are very clear about the politics in our own country and how that affects national security decisions we sometimes mistakenly think that other states are unitary actors they are not even in a dictatorship like North Korea there are factions there were politics it's pretty clear that some of the hardline factions in North Korea may be they may think that Kim has given too many concessions without getting anything back Kim may think that himself it's very clear that this statement by a very high-ranking this is official in North Korea this is Kim kye-gwan kye-gwan he's the first vice minister for foreign affairs he's pushing back directly on John Bolton he mentions him by name in the statement that was just released were just getting the english translation within the last 15 minutes and he specifically pushes back on Bolton's comments over the weekend that that reference a libya style denuclearization in other words that north korea give up everything all at once that they they hand over all their documentation that they deport all their nuclear scientists that they send their nuclear weapons to france to be dismantled before the US would do anything and what North Korea is doing is reasserting its position that it's made clear with the Chinese and the Chinese agree with it that it's made clear to the South Koreans and the South Koreans agree with us that this is a deed nuclearization of the peninsula not a unilateral step first by North Korea and that involves concessions by the United States including things like a peace treaty including things like security commitments to North Korea that's what they're reasserting they're reacting directly to John Bolton I think the administration or part of our administration overreached North Korea is pushing back well that's interesting Anita on the news coverage side of this by just how much was the administration surprised with today's announcement right well they were take by surprise you saw the State Department said that they had no knowledge of anything that was going on and the White House also had no comment for several hours and that was before when we had gotten the first initial word about that the that the summit was at risk not just tonight's news you know it's just the the situation is that the White House and the president has made the expectations for this summit huge I mean they've been talking about it for weeks if you'll recall president Trump immediately agreed to this when it was brought up without having a full discussion about it he's campaigned on it at his campaign rally recently he you know he staged this entire when the prisoners came home the other day you know this made for a TV moment so he's really really counting on this and had expected maybe not everything to go okay when they have the summit in June he had talked about well we could still walk away but I think he did expect it to happen Joe a former president once said to me it sure looks different from the cheap seats and isn't that true it describes it's true about all of us who are sports fans all of it it sure looks different from the cheap seats few people know what it's like to be president what it's like to serve a president the West Wing over at the State Department my question to you is what would your advice be there are a few or old Korea hands as they say in the government fewer of those institutional employees who've got some experience under their belts they've been around they've seen scares before ups and downs in the relationship what should the newbies know about what they're getting into right the very first piece of advice is an old one don't panic don't overreact to this don't make it any worse we had now have multiple channels of communication with North Korea let's use them in fact just as I walked into the studio there's a late-breaking story that apparently US and North Korean and South Korean officials are getting on the phone to talk about this and see if there's some way to clarify what everybody's position is that's number one number two recognize that negotiations have phases and we're now in sort of the mid phase we're now in four weeks out from the summit expect this push and pull expect posture and this is kind of what you would think each side would do stress their maximum maximal positions to try to get concessions from the other side and three this is what you were saying Brian bring in some of the older hands some of the people that have been excluded that that for example people you've had on the show like Chris Hill or Victor cha bring them in to talk and give you some advice that's what Mike Pompeo above all needs right now hey Anita Americans got nervous during the fire and fury days that was saber-rattling it involves nukes that could potentially reach our country that was scary and we saw that in the polling when things started to thaw CNN poll on the upcoming summit do you approve of Trump's decision to meet with Kim jong-un 77 percent approval rating we can't agree that many people on apple-pie in this country so that does show you there's a whole lot of people who want to see this happen yeah I mean definitely you're you're so right remember last year when there was all that talk when when the president Trump was making all those comments there was a there were a lot of people that were worried there were people on Capitol Hill that were worried that another war could start so yes I mean there are definitely people all over in Washington and across the country that really do want this to happen I just think that you know we have to remember one thing which is we're talking about you know this is Midway you know there were four weeks out one thing that I've heard over and over is that that it's usually lower-level people right not the president not the two leaders that generally work out a lot of the details beforehand by the time that you have a summit it's when you've already made some big a deal and the leaders are getting together so this is sort of going in the opposite direction right the president agreed to this meeting before all these ducks you know his Ducks were in a row hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're
