in the hills of northern Thailand there are millions of people whose lives have been hanging in the balance for years people in this village in chiang mai province belonged to the acha ethnic group whose ancestors migrated around the region centuries ago facing persecution along the way those living here now have been in Thailand for generations but many still don't have type a perk the village chief says he was the last person here to be granted citizenship 16 years ago Ghandi Chaya in the past I only had a cart that identified me as a Highlander but now I have a Thai national t-carr I'm very happy when I have money I can buy everything I want I can buy a house a car I'm glad those things remain a dream for so many others like Hmong Tandy who was born in Thailand to parents from Myanmar eight years ago he won a paper plane throwing competition and was granted a temporary Passport to represent Thailand at a competition in Japan the government at the time promised he would be granted permanent status upon his return he's now 20 and is still stateless he works part-time in a drone shop and teaches stateless children how to fly them I feel very sad because people promised they would give me tiny tschn ality they were senior people and had promised me when I was just a little boy but they broke their promise last year the military government vowed to grant Thai nationality to another 80,000 people but that would still leave hundreds of thousands if not more waiting there are many challenges facing stateless people in Thailand they have to ask for permission before leaving their village they have difficulty accessing proper education or employment and can often become victims of corrupt government officials trying to take advantage of their vulnerability in fact in the last few years many people have had their ID cards revoked after it was found they had paid bribes for them at this small government office alone four thousand corrupt cases were uncovered the government sent in more staff to resolve the problems but those in charge say the workload is huge this is a very delicate job and it can slide into corruption therefore we have to be careful that's why we can only cross us to nationality cases per day for people waiting it's not just a case of having an ID card it's a matter of dignity pride and a sense of belonging after generations of uncertainty Wayne hey al-jazeera mae taeng district Thailand
