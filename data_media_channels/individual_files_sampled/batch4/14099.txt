the Obama administration they in a about 90,000 fake refugees from Somalia who have Americans settled in Minnesota and now these fake refugees of my question is how do we send them back since they truly came under fake and false pretense how do we send them back in a way that is almost to where it's across the board throughout the whole us every faked refugee especially those from Islam that are here that are practicing Sharia law that's a car not a stimulating that are asking for their own graveyards that are asking for their own banking laws that are truly just cured practice and invade how do we handle that situation and they suggested in the UK yeah but I think it's exactly worked as a truth for us in the UK that once they arrived that it there's no turning back there's no sending back anything factually what very specific example the so called underage migrants or unaccompanied minors such as they've called it's very effective label to your point about words being used in curious ways well knows grow men got off the bus that we brought them here on luxury transport I turned out some 142 some of those before some have criminal records already and we were told they were unaccompanied minors and when the world went kind of crazy my team kind of jumped around when these aborted to your men actually what they did rather than stop the bus will stop the next load coming they put up squeeze so that we can see the guys at CPAC is a fantastic experience it's like being in a warm bath surrounded by like-minded people whereas being in the UK is kind of like being in a cold shower it's like an endurance event for more updates on CPAC and for more of my material join me at Hopkins worldcom you
