planning to visit the four men to give a speech on the 30th of July now moving on to Syria the situation in Syria is still complicated yesterday on our official website we published a comment on the recent tragic events in and so wait according to the Syrian media the number of victims of a number of terrorist attacks has exceeded 200 people 200 more were wounded we express our deep condolences to the friends and families of the victims and wish an experienced recovery to the wounded such evil deeds deserve the strongest condemnation still in general the situation in the country tends to improve the elimination of a dangerous point of terrorism in the southwest of the country in the provinces of the Rye and Quneitra is being eliminated currently supported by the Russian army a Syrian Army increases its offensive against the ISIS and its ally the army of Haledon olive elite which tries to compensate its losses by mobilizing the resources of its demoralized groups of the local area the liberated regions of their rank Anitra are continuing to implement the russian mediated agreements on the local reconciliations still a third group of reconcilable armed positioners have left for the north of Syria along with the 2,800 militants of the Javits al-nusrah and their family members recently the Council of Ministers of Syria established a special commission led by the economy and foreign trade minister mr. al fayeed it will tackle the matters of restoring territories which were cleared from the illegal armed troops the gradual stabilization of the situation and the improvement in the humanitarian area in the government control areas promotes an active process of the return of refugees and internally displaced persons only yesterday on the 25th of July over 400 Syrians returned to their homes from the neighboring Jordan and Lebanon several words on the Tanz international high-level meeting on Syria on the 30th and 31st of July in Sochi a tense international meeting in Astana format will be held it will involve deputy foreign ministers from Russia Iran and Turkey as guarantor states of the Astana process of promoting Syrian settlement as well as delegations of

Syria and around it will share opinions on the inter Syrian talks based on the resolution 2254 of the UN Security Council and keeping in mind the decisions of the Congress of Syrian National Dialogue in Sochi we'll continue the discussion of further steps in the interests of expedia launch of the constitution committee as an important element of political settlement of the Syrian crisis special attention will be paid to the humanitarian situation in Syria a session of a group established by the three guarantor countries surfaced in the process the workgroup for liberating the hostages repatriation of the bodies and the search for missing in action will also be held on the margins of the meeting in Sochi several more words on the recently published report of the Bundestag scientific service on the legality of Russia's involvement in the Syrian conflict our Western partners have made numerous accusations against Russia on the supposedly illegal presence of the russian air force in the territory of Syria and it is important that this was said by those who for decades have violated the international norms and interfered in the internal affairs of other states including Syria Russia's position on this matter is well known and it has been reiterated on numerous occasions it was also confirmed by the legal Syrian government still these countries ignoring common sense continued implementing their goals covering up by dubious arguments the matters of the legitimacy of the presence in Syria drew the attention of specialists in international law in the West therefore we would like to draw your attention to the report of the scientific service of Bundestag published on the 28th of June this year on the international legal evaluation of the participation of a number of countries in the Syrian conflict its conclusions are rather exemplary the authors examined the role and the parameters of Russian participation in the events taking place in Syria it is reported that the Russian military presence in the sovereign territory of Syria and the relevant Russian military operations are carried out solely on the permission of the Syrian government therefore we're talking about the so-called and Aaron's on invitation according to the majority point of view in international law such interference is acceptable and does not go against the ban of the article two-point paragraph of the UN Charter for the use of force these guides the International Criminal Court and the Commission of international law of the UN the territorial sovereignty allows the state to have a foreign military presence on its sovereign territory this is not about the violation of the ban on use of force since the Russian military operation are not meant against the legal and legitimate authorities in Syria therefore the Russian presence in Syria in the context of international law is acceptable as for the United States everything is not as clear as said by the German experts their evaluations are available in this report it has been published let us move on to Ukraine we are concerned and worried about the events taking place there we we are looking at numerous acts of violence against national and ethnic minorities in particular the Roma we have drawn the attention of the international community several times the outbreak of nationalism and neo fascist ideology as well as violence against the religious people violation of linguistic rights murders and persecutions of journalists attacks against national minorities this is all a norm in this country and the most cynical thing is that all these actions are allowed with the with the ignorant attitude of the Kiev authorities who do not wish or cannot restrain the violent radicals in fact they are dividing the people into Ukrainian citizen and citizens of second trade we all know too well while this policy leads to history teaches us that the International monitoring mechanisms and human rights cannot turn a blind eye to the outrageous events in Ukraine the experts of the UN Human Rights Council have made several declarations due to the recent attacks against the Roma community which resulted in the murder of one and its members that after secretary-general of the Council of Europe mr. Vulcan and his Twitter account also condemned this crime we welcome the fact that the world community begins to wake up and see clearly what the situation really is in Ukraine we hope that the other crimes of the Ukrainian radicals as well as the discriminatory actions of the Kiev authorities against all ethnic groups will not be left without the attention of the world community and all the culpable will be held responsible we continue paying the most special attention to the situation around the investigation of the incidents in Salisbury and Amesbury in Great Britain we see that for the lack of official declarations the British media are eager to spread the unverifiable leaks concerning the investigation however the published information only confirms the British policy to classify the information which could shed light on the real events that took place in Salisbury and Amesbury in this context what is odd is the details on the condition of Charley Rowley which were shared by his brother it turns out that mr. Rowley is prohibited from leaving the room in which he is held under constant police surveillance he is cut off from the external world has no access to television newspapers and other sources of information he is a police he should phone he is banned from revealing any information on his location this resembles the situation with Sergey and Julius creeper which were hidden by the British authorities from British and international community let me remind you that London in violation of relevant provision of the Vienna Convention on consular relations and the bilateral convention of 1965 continues to ignore the request to provide consular access citing the necessity to protect the privacy of us cripple this only increases our suspicion that the scribbles were forcibly isolated by the British authorities to avoid any unnecessary questions consequently we continue insisting on providing consular access to this cripples who are Russian citizens while the British public should take a look at the in fact illegal detention of a British citizen who became an accidental victim of a crime it seems that the patients in Britain are discharged from hospitals in Salisbury in order to avoid their communications with the outside world apparently we see a reason for various human rights NGOs to take a serious look at the careless attitude of London to basic human rights including the unmotivated limitations in human contacts and movement now we would like to make a comment on the request of the BBC on the reaction of the head of the Hermitage capital fund William Browder towards Russia on the 19th of July we received a request from the BBC to make an urgent comment on several serious declarations and even accusations of the head of Hermitage capital William Roda against the Russian authorities and to send a written material by 900 hours the next day on the 20th of July it was promised that the comment without any edits would be read on the TV transmission on William Browder in spite of being busy the ministry prepared a large response incentive to the BBC in the morning who was surprised to find out that our comment in the best traditions of the British media was severely compressed only 10% of it was used with most of the 20 minutes going to the interview with Browder our comment lasted only one minute of airtime this is not the first time that the BBC in what is involved in making extracts of the comments of the Russian officials sometimes out of 45 minutes of interview with the authorities of our ministry only four and a half minutes ago life on air there is a characteristic example of the recent interview of mr. Lavrov for hard talk show back then serious fragments explaining the Russian positions on many issues were cut from the air we are stricken by such disbalance in the information provision we think this is unacceptable for a professional and unbiased media since the BBC did not wish to provide a full comment who will use this occasion and do it on our own this is how the comment went it is odd to hear words on kidnapping a person who stole over one and a half billion dollars in Russia and was sentenced twice in 2012 and 2017 sentenced to nine years of imprisonment and a large fine moreover there is another case against him on serious articles the Russian relevant authorities are going to question number of intelligence agencies employees from the US and Britain starting from 2004 the Russian investigation authorities have registered 12 crimes committed by William Brown and his complicity with further criminal cases and curt hearings on the facts of lack of payment of taxes tax evasion and bankruptcy legalization of money and money laundering as well as other crimes the actions of Browder have resulted in the damage from more than 4.5 billion roubles in February 2018 the Russian authorities have started another investigation on the paragraph 1 of the article 210 of the Russian Criminal Code organizing a criminal community for joint commitment of serious crimes as well as coordination of criminal activities of the members of this criminal group this article includes all the conditions of brothers work including his false statements in the US courts on the case US vs bears own company currently broader faces accusations on tax evasion thanks agent violations and forest bankruptcy Oh tax evasion he even used the people with disabilities who are employed by the company but in fact did not do any work moreover due to providing false information to the tax authorities they used a reduced tax rate thanks to this case unique materials were gathered Russia thinks that using it could change the attitudes of the Western society to the Magnitsky Act the existence of which allows proud to evade international arrest showing off as a victim of political persecution by Russian authorities damaging our interests the full 7 page version of the comment with the legal facts and grounds was sent to the BBC if anyone is interested we are eager to share it should you send a relevant request overall who would like to underline that we will continue giving comments on the current international issue we hope that the journalists for whom professional ethics means something will be able to tell this to their audiences to establish an objective view of the current situation as for the issue of the arrest in the u.s. of Russian citizen Maria butanna we continue to carefully following the destiny of an arrested Russian citizen in Washington on July the 15th the employees of our embassy visited her in Prison and they were present in the court while some procedures were ongoing the US State Department received strong condemnation due to the actions against our citizen including a psychological pressure as an example let's have a look at a tower search upon arrest when FBI agents were rushed into the rented apartment breaking the furniture opening and breaking floors and walls they didn't find anything wrong but due to the lack of evidences of her involvement they still refused to set her free so the whole case is built on some snow correspondents of Marie abou Tina which is she's being criminate adverse involvement as work as foreign agent even though she was not doing that she was studying in one of the universities in the United States was interested in weapon and she went to the National Rifle Association of the United States she was opened was not hiding anything and was not hiding her Russian citizenship from anyone she had nothing to cover or to hide from anyone so this is an outrageous situation and some political forces on the United States have proceeding from their interests invented a story about Russian involve involvement and interference in the u.s. elections and in the within the framework of this campaign they put Maria Putin imprison Beijing in fact only on her background on the country she was born so what is our concern is that she could this these accusations can be directed against anyone against any others our citizen and we urged the United States to stop this outrageous activities and to if the United States proceed from their political interest it means that Marie Bettina is a political prisoner of course we invade our attention to the Crimea declaration published by the United States and we made our comments on this it was it coincided with the statement of the current state secretary at the hearings in American Congress where he promised to continue a HUD policy towards our country and this will be named in future from Paris declaration there is nothing new in this declaration the statements about Russia in particular but Crimea this is what we hear all the time in Washington and fortunately American politicians who are actively supporting the coup d'etat in Kiev and then the persecutions against russian-speaking population in Ukraine they violate the UN Charter and they deny the crimeans in the rights of self-determination that they realize during the open referendum in 2014 we repeatedly reiterated that for for us this issues closed Crimea is part of the territory of the Russian Federation despite of whether the United States liked it or not by the way every time more and more Americans and citizens of other countries stop believing in story about Russian occupation and willing to come to the peninsula and to spend some time to work there the attempts of the Washington to present their own version of the International Adam to fail because everyone sees that they start speaking about principles of equality and total integrity of a state only when it satisfies American interests but who in the United States remembered about sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia during the bombardments of former Yugoslavia and further declaration of the independence in Kosovo and it is hypocritical the use of threats and the principles of no use of force or threats of using force the principle that is used by the State Department and we can just take a report Congressional Research Service reports and it says that during Cold War Pentagon participated in 46 military campaigns abroad and from 92 to 2017 their number increased four times up to 188 and this doesn't include security operations and so you decide who is really aggressive now let's speak about cyber spots the United States as any other sovereign state has right to create any formats to discuss their concerns talk of establishment by Washington of a separate group to fight Russian cyber spats has gone on for a long time to our opinion it is caused by the internal political fight inside the United States against US president Trump these only improves the confrontation between our countries and a few further fuels the real that's the story about cyber attacks in Russia but our side prefers official captivation with Washington on the issues of cyber security we are open to conduct a serious and profound dialogue the ball the cyber ball is in US Court and it is now up to Americans how at expert level or at political level to provide a response if they believe that Russia can be threatened in particular by creation up various groups to counter invented threats it's a mistake we're self-confident we know our possibilities and we're not teetering around anyone and we are not going to do that we can't not ultimatums and note on unilateral activities by cyber waste but on constructive and meaningful dialogue few words throughout the oil supplies to the PRC the turkey we took note of relevant comments made by a number of medium referred to a permanent representative of the United States to the UN as if Russia and China would block American requests to the Security Council committees 1718 on sanctions with respect to D P R K about the prohibition of the supplies of oil products to the country and we need to clarify the issue first of all item 5 unanimously adopted by the resolution 2397 of the UN Security Council establishes a year limit on the old product supplies to King young and the committee 1718 was tasked to notify when the general volume of the oil products supplied to DPRK which is 75 90 and 95 and only in last case they have to notify about the immediate termination of sales supplies or transfers of oil products for the peers in the pure Cade until the rest of the year second the aggregated amount of the supplies according to the information of the web page of the committee was only one-fourth of the before mentioned thresholds there are no concerns and the there is no reason to stop exporting oil products to DPRK however following their favorite policy the Americans informed to the committee 1718 that according to their evaluation due to the use of prohibited by the resolution of Security Council 2375 and 2397 of a practice to reload oil products in open sea in fact North Korean side allegedly over which the year limits so of Washington calculated that from 1st January to 30 May there were 89 of such cases and according to the satellite photographs published by the US there were cases of illegal operations in open sea and they attached for more satellite pictures when sending the request to the committee and it contains the real situation according to them what was happening in the North Korean ports they used when preparing their evaluations mathematic modeling they take is about is the capacity of North Korean tankers and calculates a what amount could be filled in when a loading City 350 or 90% it is evident that so easily the United the United Nations Security Council cannot decide there is a group of experts that has a mandate to review or even investigate such cases from the beginning we were not evading the discussion of the situation and we indicated to the Americans that they shouldn't act this way moreover the information is not consistent and there are no facts that enough and that prove it they didn't hear us and they decided to continue in any case we were not blocking their requests we call our UN Security Council colleagues to be responsible when performing their work and towards work of the agencies of the United Nations organizations to follow the procedures and to restrain from the their own interpretations of certain proposed items of the resolution of the UN Security Council on July 17 in the region Minister of Defense Bakugan Singh said that Oslo is intensifying its military potential in the North because of the most threatening neighbor Russia and it will protect the country from the Russian border and then further to the south and there is a question what's the drummer Jensen said repeatedly but no way doesn't see any direct military threat from our country and this idea was supported by other Norwegian officials at the very high level has their position changed and no Norwegian neighbors consider as a threat we believe that such a responsible allegations undermine the trust and predictability in our relations including in the question about Russian knowledge and water aides but it doesn't help to build our relations on the basis of the principles of good neighborliness and mutual respect we believe that it is necessary to speak about the issue of satellite telephones confiscation from Japanese group that visited South Korea Ireland was charter flight in accordance with the agreements reached by Russian and Japanese ledin after the bilateral meeting on the second 22nd 23rd of July from Hokkaido to Kuna shear and a troop was married flight charter flight was a group of Japanese former citizens of the island to visit the places where their relatives are buried the trip was within the framework of a Soviet Japanese agreement about visa free visiting of the places where the relatives of those people are buried and the agreement was adopted on July 1986 during all the customs in the airport Mindi live the some people had as it was identified satellite telephones considering that it violates article 17 point 2 part 1 of the legislation of Russia and it violates article 16 point about the limits on the on some goods delivered to the territory of the Eurasian Economic Union of the code of the Russian Federation the owners had no permissions to bring high frequency equipment with them at the same time the there was another co-op meant from TV TV equipment that was registered and there was no problems was bringing in that type of equipment unfortunately the Japanese participants refused to sign the Declaration of violation the code and at the moment of the reason administrative investigation ongoing that will be further transferred to the court we would like to remind the necessity to comply with Russian legislation during visiting in the visits of the Russian Federation including South Korea grill island you know perfectly well about a complicated situation in Greece would like to express our condolences to the people because of tragic events wildfires in attic region according to the information 81 people died and more than 60 are in hospitals there were no Russian citizens and injured among those people we express our words of solidarity with those who were involved and we wish speedy recovery to the injured and a few words about the signature memorandum of video and volunteering program on July 26 and most cruel took place a memorandum signing ceremony about the contribution to the budget of the program urine volunteering and it provides for participation of Russian volunteers in the activities of the UN more than 1 million dollars is contributed to the program and 19 volunteers from the Russian Federation will take part in various projects and programs for international development and peace within the United Nations programs the
