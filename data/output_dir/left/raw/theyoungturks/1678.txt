1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,650
VARIOUS POINTS IN NORTH KOREA
THERE HAVE BEEN AMERICAN

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,590
PRISONERS THERE, WE KNOW
SOMETIMES THEY ARE RETURNED TO

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:15,840
US AND THAT IS SEEMINGLY GOOD
NEWS BACON AND HORRIBLY.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,279
WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF GOOD
NEWS, IT HAS TO DO WITH THREE

5
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:37,290
PRISONERS.

6
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,480
THEY ARE THE ONLY PRISONERS
BELIEVED TO BE HELD IN NORTH

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,839
KOREA.

8
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:55,210
THEY HAVE NO ACTUALLY BEEN
RELEASED.

9
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:11,409
IT 

10
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:14,939
SEEMS LIKE NONSENSE THAT WE
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS AT ALL.

11
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,409
IT DOES HAVE TO DO WITH THE
SUMMIT THAT WILL BE

12
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:20,040
HAPPENING AT SOME POINT IN THE
FUTURE.

13
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,890
I THINK THE SCARIEST THING
ABOUT THIS IS THAT AFTER HIS

14
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:30,920
TWEET NOBODY BELIEVED HIM AND
THAT IS SO SAD.

15
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,789
THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN MAKE A
STATEMENT LIKE THREE AMERICAN

16
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:40,270
PRISONERS ARE COMING HOME FROM
NORTH KOREA.

17
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:48,390
I THINK PART OF THE REASON IS
THAT LAST WEEK RUDY GIULIANI

18
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,159
SAID THEY WOULD BE COMING HOME
ON THURSDAY, THEN TWO THINGS

19
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,159
HAPPENED.

20
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,399
THEY DIDN'T, AND HE IS NOT A
WHITE HOUSE EMPLOYEE AND DOESN'T

21
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,799
HAVE A SECURITY CLEARANCE SO
NOBODY COULD EXPLAIN HOW HE

22
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,360
WOULD EVEN KNOW.

23
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,459
THE OTHER PART OF THE REASON
IS EVERYTHING IS A LIE.

24
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,220
THANKFULLY THEY DID IN THE END
BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AMAZING

25
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,970
FOR BOTH OF THEM AND THEIR
FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

26
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,140
I JUST READ SOMETHING LAST
WEEK SAYING THIS IS A

27
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:34,980
RESULT OF A PRESIDENT 

28
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,220
THAT LIES
CONSISTENTLY.

29
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,671
THERE IS ALWAYS A ROUNDABOUT
WAY OF SAYING HE IS A

30
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:46,690
CONSISTENT LIAR.

31
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,330
IT IS THE AGE-OLD TALE.

32
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,560
ONCE THERE IS SOMETHING REAL OR
SERIOUS OR NECESSARY, NO

33
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:06,220
ONE IS GOING TO BELIEVE HIM
ANYMORE EVEN SUPPORTERS.

34
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,860
SO THIS IS A RESULT OF THAT SO
WHEN IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS

35
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:15,860
REAL OR POSITIVE LIKE THESE
THREE MEN, YOU HAVE NUMBER THE

36
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,160
SUPPORT OF EVEN YOUR OWN
SUPPORTERS.

37
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:29,600
CAN YOU IMAGINE ñ I REMEMBER
THE FEELING.

38
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:39,060
I CAN IMAGINE BEING A WEIRD
STATE OF WE WILL SEE.

39
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:48,510
IMMEDIATELY AFTER WHAT YOU
GET IS HIM SAYING IT IS ME.

40
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,799
EVERYBODY SAYS I SHOULD WIN A
NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.

41
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:58,459
I DON'T THINK SO BUT EVERYONE
ELSE THINKS.

42
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:02,480
THIS DOES APPEAR TO BE
BECAUSE OF HIM.

43
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,859
OBVIOUSLY US JOURNALISTS ARE
GOING TO BE BIASED IN TERMS OF

44
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:09,019
THEIR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE US AS
OPPOSED TO OTHER COUNTRIES SO

45
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:23,950
I'M NOT SHOCKED TO FIND OUT.

46
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:30,300
I'M NOT GOING TO DENY THAT
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ñ

47
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:38,990
WHICH PART OF DONALD TRUMP'S
BEHAVIOR OR DISCUSSIONS WITH KIM

48
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:50,080
JONG-IL AND WOULD LEAD TO THIS
TYPE OF POSITIVE RESULT?

49
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
IS IT

50
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
TWEETS?

51
00:04:52,080 --> 00:05:07,210
I 
THINK AGREEING COULD MEET

52
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,650
AND UP IN DISASTER.

53
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:15,440
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE NOT
TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF THAT.

54
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,500
IN ADDITION TO THE CLOSING DOWN
OF THE SITE THAT LIKELY WASN'T

55
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,710
OPERATING ANYWAY.

56
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,580
SOME OF IT DOESN'T APPARENTLY
COUNT FOR MUCH BUT THIS IS

57
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,090
SOMETHING AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE
IT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY

58
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,250
ARE GOING TO HAVE THAT SUMMIT.

59
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:47,590
WHEN THIS ALL FALLS TO HOW I
WILL REPORT IT TO YOU.

60
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,630
THERE IS INTERNET, OR
SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENING ñ

61
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,740
INTERNATIONAL DISCUSSIONS
HAPPENING.

62
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,210
YOU SAY NICE THINGS TO HIM, YOU
BE NICE TO HIM, AND YOU WILL GET

63
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,890
WHAT YOU WANT.

64
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,990
I THINK EVERYBODY KNEW THAT
EXCEPT FOR DONALD TRUMP.

65
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:13,900
COOLEST THINGS GET DONE,
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CATCH ME

66
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,550
COMPLAINING ABOUT IT.

67
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:28,640
HE POINTED OUT THAT THE DECISION
TO ENGAGE WITH THE UNITED STATES

68
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,340
FOR THIS UPCOMING SUMMIT IS NOT
A RESULT OF THE SANCTIONS

69
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,830
THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED FROM THE
OUTSIDE.

70
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:46,620
IT 
IS NOT WHAT BROUGHT THEM TO

71
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,110
THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.

72
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,250
IT IS ONLY IF WASHINGTON
WITHDRAWS THEIR HOSTILE POLICIES

73
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,250
TOO.

74
00:06:53,250 --> 00:07:00,440
IT IS DEEPER THAN THAT AND I
HOPE THEY TAKE IT ONE MORE

75
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:07,540
LEVEL.

76
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,260
I GRANT IT, IT IS NOT
TOTALLY UP TO THAT AND I THINK

77
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,260
IF IT WERE

78
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:23,740
IT WOULD PROBABLY END
DIFFERENTLY BUT IT 

79
00:07:23,740 --> 00:00:00,000
IS HAPPENING.
