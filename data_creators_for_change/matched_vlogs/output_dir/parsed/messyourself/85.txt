mean here it is are we just gonna take
it off him no we're gonna pull out oh no
poor guy poor guy
oh okay it's fine it's just a head
they're just dumping the androids I mean
surely these Android would be worth a
lot of money why they just are even if
they are broken what would you sell them
off for parts okay we can take this
guy's buy out and we can put it in
Marcus's head Oh God God Marcus in you
go disgusting
examine oh no it's a little girl it's a
gold robot oh okay she wants to live oh
my good I couldn't kill that girl
because she wanted to live
ahh she wants to live that's so sad

dead robots for parts but he's now a
okay but man I want to know what he's
thinking climb the slope all right start
climbing this slope Oh disgusting okay

oh okay come on Marcus you can do it get
out of there you could do it you must
escape
don't let the humans win not let the god
damned humans win Marcus no come on do
it fuckers do it come on you could do it
man we haven't really known anything
about Marcus's story yet so I want to
know what Marcus does now he doesn't
have enough he can't go back to call his
owner because he killed his son
Wow but he made it out alive he's free
freedom freed up
okay so I thought they would cut the
black there but it didn't okay check it
what's going on what's this
is he gonna remove this his Android
thing can even do that know what up oh
god oh god oh god just removed it and
now what's that just skin
so we're people start thinking that he's
not an Android whoa look it's just it's
just gone I didn't know that would work
this kid just repaired itself and just
and just worked over it okay so he
doesn't look like an Android anymore
apart from his wounds
my name is
now look at
now Marcus okay well yeah I think that
was pretty much it
there was no multiple choices for that
or I could have killed or not killed
those two people anyway let's continue
all right we're going back to god damn
Connor so Connor is now finding Amanda
who's Amanda look at this beautiful
place so yeah where we left off with
Connor last time we interrogated that
dude I did keep that dude alive and he's
in he's now in jail the other robot that
killed his owner but yeah now we got to
speak to someone called Amanda as Connor
who is this Amanda bitch my name is
Connor hello Amanda Connor oh she's all
facing you what huh
congratulations Connor finding that
deviant was far from easy okay thank you
and the way you interrogated it was very
clever she okay she's been remarkably
efficient Connor
it is like the mother robot oh she likes
Thank You Amanda Thank You Amanda uncle
that's the DPD to transfer it to us for
further study
it may teach us something about what
happened oh the interrogation seemed
challenging well what did you think of
the deviant what did I think of him um
traumatized
it showed signs of PTSD after being
abused by its owner as if its original
program had been completely replaced by
new instructions yeah I guess out this
lieutenant Anderson has been officially
assigned to the deviancy case all right
do you make of him I don't like him wait
who is he
dysfunctional shorter we define him as
dysfunction
he obviously has a personal situation
impacting his professional behavior and
yeah seems to have no interest in the
investigation that's so true
unfortunately we have no choice but to
work with him hey what do you think is
the best approach we kill him uh
friendly indifferent I don't know that I
will adapt to his personality sure it is
in the best interest of the
investigation that I avoid conflict and
try to accommodate his psychology what
more and more Android show signs of
deviancy there are millions in
circulation whoa they become unstable
the consequences would be disastrous
yeah Bruce advanced prototype cyber life
has ever created
yeah if anyone can figure out what's
happening it's you damn don't count on
me Amanda you can count on me Amanda I'm
Connor
hello one corner hey Connor has his
weird voice back Harry Connor re-crossed
a little time damn is little time
because it's Connor versus every Android
that's going rogue oh my good hon up
were running out of time we gotta go all
right cool so we met Amanda she's like
the mother of all robots or like the
programmer I have no idea who she is but
Connor and Amanda know each other
so finally tenant Anderson sure let's do
it go to reception come on bitch hello
bitch you here to see lieutenant
Anderson yeah do you have authorization
yes I do you bitch yes
check my head I love that
go on connect with me go yeah this is
our robots do it Anderson hasn't arrived
yet but you can wait at his desk good
man it freaks me out that there's robots
everywhere okay so we're gonna wait his
desk all right we're gonna wait outside
his desk look at this place it's so cool
man this has gotten such an upgrade
since the previous games excuse me oh
okay you know what time lieutenant
Anderson usually arrives depends on
where he was the night before ha ha ha
if we're lucky we'll see him before noon
no also comes to work at noon was this
listen to what
I'm worried what I'm listening to play
oh it's rock music it goes like we tell
is this Knights of the Black Death ok so
the lieutenant likes death metal music
okay we can analyze his desk
oh god I don't give a shit this is his
hair from his dog okay so yeah we now
know a little bit more money oh I see
you again lieutenant hello Jesus Hank in
my office uh-oh
do I come or do I listen at oh do I
enter in listening you think we should
listen in I think we should oh okay you
know they okay with me does this thing
in it I mean I'm part of the case right
I've got ten new cases involving
androids on my desk every day whoa we've
always had isolated incidents old ladies
losing their Android mage and that kind
of crap but now we're all assaults and
even suicide homicide last night oh this
isn't just cyber life's problem anymore
it's now a criminal investigation in
weed yeah with it before that shit hits
the fan
yeah but fortunately I'm going to
investigate these cases and see if
there's any link is there I gotta be the
one to deal with this shit
I am the least qualified cop in the
country to handle this case yeah I know
jack shit about androids Jeffrey
I can barely change the settings on my
own phone everybody's overloaded I think
you're perfectly qualified for this type
of investigation is it the truth is
nobody wants to investigate these
androids and you'll let me home the bag
J's several I've sent over this Android
to help with the investigation it's a
state-of-the-art prototype it'll act as
your partner no way I don't need a
partner I'm certainly not this plastic
prank hey you are seriously starting to
piss me off you were supposed to do what
I say and such a goddamn mouth oh my god
a man has to say to you oh okay yeah I
didn't hear that so I don't have to add
any more pages to your disciplinary
folder cuz it already looks like a novel
this conversation is over
haha funny Jesus Christ
doing this to me these things why are
you doing this to me
oh why doing it there I've had just
about enough of your bitch but I've been
do your job or you hand in your badge oh

like that Oh Hank doesn't want me as a
partner I'm not standing there right now

I only take orders from lieutenant
Anderson oh yeah get rich on the way
yesterday I would have do you up for
disobeying human Oh way cuz next time
you won't get off so easy oh this is so
mean I don't like it oh poor Connor okay
I probably should have gone to that room
instead of loud to him oh I can go over
to the jail cell
do you think I could talk to the other
guy oh my goodness they're going to
destroy me since II uh I don't know what
to do
compassionate I'm sorry it's not what I
wanted but there's nothing I can do
there's nothing I could do I'm just a
robot oh I know there's something you
didn't tell me there is I need to know
before they take you away oh my god
we're gonna find out some more stuff
this statue at the sculpture you made
but we know tell me more about it
tell me more please
I'm going to die Oh No

do it again Pacific oh my god no oh this
poor guy don't do this oh no man I
couldn't stop so I believe this mess up
oh this he died anyway so how did all
that work trying to say even in the
interrogation and he dies anyway I don't
think there's I think I think he will
always die or would maybe if I don't
speak to him he'll he'll it will not die
okay we'll have to see at the end on the
flowchart but yeah Jesus Christ boy does
this game what from me okay we can be
pragmatic
listen oh I know you don't like me but
we're going to have to work together
yeah we're gonna do both have to make an
effort
oh look up grumpy is partners now that
we're partners it would be great to get
to know each other better

you listen to Knights of the Black Death
I really like that music
yes is it full of energy you listen to
heavy metal I don't really listen to
music as such but I'd like to okay my
relationship with the heights going up
do you always arrive at the office at
this time I arrive when I arrive it's
not busting my balls okay oh but you
meant to come to work okay all right
there's just I have any files on
deviance I'd like to take a look at yeah
terminals on your desk knock yourself
out okay well thank you all right I know
what that poster of Hank too much
because I don't think he likes me
all right let's just access the files oh
okay all right this game I'm gonna make
me read stuff because I got time to this
scan all files here we go that's the fun
of the default yeah yeah just use my
robot brain to scan every bugger even 43
files war dates back nine months okay it
also started in Detroit and quickly
spread across the country
Oh an ax 400 is reported to have
murdered a man last night whoa that
could be a good starting point for our
investigation wait is it Marcus because
I killed I killed them leo Marcus killed
Leo last night oh this is wet this is
how the character is gonna meet aren't
they Connors gonna meet Marcus because
we killed the other guy oh god I have no
idea what to do uh let's be direct you
shouldn't let your personal situation
hamper the investigation lieutenant you
don't know what the hell you're talking
about
so why don't you just run your program
and shut up oh my god it's a bit mean
determined I've been assigned this
mission lieutenant oh I didn't come here
to wait until you feel like working Oh
nestled close up to me I throw the lot
of you in the dumpster and set a match
to it so stop pissing me off
thanks very nasty Oh lieutenant sorry to
disturb you have some information on the
ax 400 that killed the guy last night
yeah it's been cited in the Raymond Dale
district on it wait is it Marcus or is
it someone else we will find out I guess
okay so alright so were there multiple
ways of doing that mission I'm not sure
if there was okay so the flowchart says
oh there was Frank Hank got a lead so
the other option is Frank I mean I keep
saying Frank the other option is Hank
didn't get a lead okay so we don't want
to do that there's no point to checking
that out you know so let's just move on
all right here we go baby whoo we're
gonna be following it's a good-looking
following in Cara okay so I went with
the ending where Cara was in the in the
abandoned building with with this dude
what's his name
yeah so I went with this ending because
I wanted to make sure I meet that that
character might be important in in this
game so I wanted to yeah should we check
upstairs because we haven't checked
upstairs there's a cupboard here okay
open it all right
nothing in it what pointless shit oh I
can take this jacket oh okay oh I think
Cara wants to change her appearance so
she doesn't look like a like a robot
anymore or an Android okay yeah because
um there was not trying to steal clothes
from the laundromat but I guess if he
didn't then you find clothes in this
place okay cool so Cara's gonna get
changed so now she's not wearing android
codes okay
I found some human clothes and we gotta
cut our hair okay all right now we're
gonna change our appearance oh yeah
Cara's gonna have a short hair like she
likes you always did oh here we go
cut the hair here we go wait what
happens to robots if they cut their hair
will it grow back
I mean it's not real hair so I'm
guessing at one whoa look at that now ah
she looks so cute with us your hair okay
cool a blonde white black or finish I
kind of like it the way it is I'm just
gonna I'm just gonna keep it that way
okay I kind of like it this way all
right
remove she's gonna remove her thing oh
my god
ow disgusting out okay
all right cool and you're good to go car
oh that's just gonna heal itself because
you're an Android and yeah all right so

Romania that I thought it was Marcus
what you gonna do without it
all the police are on to me Connor and
Cara are right next to each other it
took the first bus that came along and
stayed at the end of the line whoa
it's decision wasn't planned it was
driven by fear
Anders don't feel fear yeah the durians
do DV 1 by their emotions and make
irrational decisions

it went
Oh didn't have a plan and I had nowhere
to go
I brought behind you maybe it didn't go

oh we now we now know more there's a
fire as well androids don't need heat oh
oh okay I couldn't find them guys did
you find something
no no no that's not here huh yeah just
like I said in the first place but let's
get out of here ah but it was here
closed confused okay I don't know where
Cora and an Alice twent
we gonna find out okay I didn't want
Connor to capture anyway but I kinda
wanted to see what would happen
oh they were under the stairs of course
they were I was about to do about to go
there oh I was like trying to find where
the stress was protect a little girl
whoa
he was supposed to find her Oh
raus on our side okay
protect the little girl we got to go
we're gonna are we gonna have run away
it's gonna be a massive chase scene I
already know it is I already know is
okay just teleport to the kitchen but
yeah you carry on with your ra9 shit
geez
all right anyway Oh God is that the
mission oh it was oh ok so there's so
many options for this but I think like
because you know you could have either
been in the motel the abandoned car yeah
so many other options so I think that's
what everything else is see like it
starts off of morning in a squat and the
two other options were the car or the
motel so I think it's pretty much the
same except this time Alice and Cora
what undiscovered and I think you could
have been discovered and that could have
led to this hmm I feel like we missed
out actually because we didn't do that
should we go back and see what this
whole thing is all right let's catch
Cora under the stairs
oh no here we go there right there oh oh
yeah
kyle is gonna chase her then go we're
gonna chase them that way they're headed
for the train station they headed for
the train station run ha ha ha oh shit
I'm crazy chasey which I would have
missed out on if I didn't go I got a
ride I hope she got a run oh my god oh
my god oh my god okay where do they go
where do they go I would like winning
this force with a little girl too
okay just keep running keep running
go go go go go wipe I have to chase them

catch scar or should I let them go okay
I want to see what Connor I want to see
what happens

across the danger come on I can't do
that
oh my goodness poor girl poor Alice
what's gonna happen that's it
no no oh okay let's go get hit my god oh
my god oh no oh god sorry guys I'm doing
on purpose I was too happens okay
Alice got hit by a car I didn't think
wow that was an ending they died on the
highway okay well I'm sorry guys I
wanted to see what happens
I didn't think they would both die I
thought you know anyway let's just see
what the other two endings are all right
this time guys all right we're gonna
keep on doing it
come on right come on Alice come on come
on do come on time there were this blast
off the motorway
Oh God okay okay let them get away just
going on whoa oh no my relationship with
Heights gone down but who cares
you're gonna go he's so badass way I'm
gonna get you by the car
no way logos Oh Lord Jesus Christ
gonna go hit by car mop it's the car
revenge oh no now I know which oh god oh
god be careful be careful here we go
oh god oh there we go okay be careful
all right
it's fine we made it okay so I know
Connor dies he does come back because he
you know he works for the police so yeah
she's okay so that ending Connor died
but Karan Alice lived alright so yeah
sorry I'm trying I do want to see all
the endings on this one I was like I
don't care but I do actually now that I
think about it because there is a lot so
yeah with that ending Connor go hit my
car I wouldn't just see if kind of could
actually get hit by God apparently you
can oh okay Karan I let's reach the
other side but Connor didn't alright
there's one more ending now is that
where Connor catches Alice or I don't
know let's find out alright Connors not
gonna mess up this time guys I really
want to see what happens
as a laughs ending okay alright so this
time Connor and Cora are going to stay
alive but what's gonna happen then Oh
go go go go go go go there we go left Oh
Oh careful careful go and then konasana
is coming right behind you Oh God I
don't know oh no oh no oh God
are they gone any of it oh they got on
the train I think they did oh so they
escaped by the train and Connor's still
alive okay I think that ending was was
the coolest but but Connor now knows who
Cora is and what she looks like
so yeah maybe that ending isn't the best
one but I think that I think we should
go with that ending guys you know like I
said you know leave a comment on which
endings you would like that's why I'm
doing all the endings but oh yeah I
think that was all three endings okay
all three main endings anyway but yeah
Cora and Alice you know dodged Connor
there was no option where Connor could
get Connor on Alice okay guys I think
I'm gonna end the video there now I am
