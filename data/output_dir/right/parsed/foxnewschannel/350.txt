>> JUSTICE THOMAS AND BRETT
KAVANAUGH OR LIKELY BOTH OF
THEM, TWO OUT OF TWEEN 9 CITY
JUSTICES HAVE INCREDIBLY ACCUSED
OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT IS GOING TO
BE CONFIRMED ANYWAY.
THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER THEY
WILL BE NICE TO HIM BUT WHETHER
THE OTHER JUSTICES WILL CHANGE
THEIR VOTING BEHAVIOR IN
RESPONSE.
>> THE COURT IS NOT ON THE LEVEL
AFTER TODAY.
AMERICANS ARE NOT HAVE FAITH IN
THE SUPREME COURT.
>> THEY WARNED US ABOUT
FACTIONS, SEEING THE WAY THE
SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN FRACTION
ALLIES THAT.
>> THIS IS A LIVE SHOT ON THE
SENATE FLOOR AS THEY CURRENTLY,
30 HOURS OF DEBATE.
THE CLOTURE DEBATE WILL BE
LIMITED SO THEY CAN'T
FILIBUSTER, 30 HOURS IN SEPARATE
4:52 TONIGHT.
OVERNIGHT WHILE YOU WERE
SLEEPING BECAUSE THE VOTE
ALREADY HAPPENED SENATORS HAVE
BEEN TALKING ABOUT BRETT
KAVANAUGH.
>> THIS IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS
ENTIRE WEEK OF PROTESTERS BUT WE
HAVE GOTTEN IT RIGHT NOW.
THE MOST IMPORTANT VOICE -- GOOD
MORNING, LADIES.
>> THE MEDIA MELTDOWN THAT HAS
ENSUED, PREDICTABLE?
>> THIS IS WHAT THEY DO BUT WHAT
I LOVE IS REPUBLICANS STOOD UP,
STOOD BOLD WITH THESE PEOPLE.
WE CANNOT MAKE ALLEGATIONS
AGAINST SOMEONE WITHOUT
EVIDENCE.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE EVIDENCE.
BRETT CAVANAGH, I SIT WITH HIM.
THE STORY WAS COMPELLING.
I BELIEVE DOCTOR FORD?
SOMETHING HAPPENED BUT IT WASN'T
BRETT KAVANAUGH.
>> GOING TO BE A BIG DAY.
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
ABOUT THE ELECTION IS HE IS
GOING TO TEACH HOW TO FIGHT.
>> WHEN YOU WRITE YOU FIGHT.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS BODY
BUT THE FACTS.
HOLD ON, WAIT A MINUTE AND DON'T
HOLD US TO TASK.
YOU HAVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CULTURE WHERE
YOU ARE RACIST OR THIS OR THAT
AND REPUBLICANS FAULT.
NEW REPUBLICANS, WE DON'T FAULT,
WE KNOW HOW TO FIGHT.
I WILL SHOW YOU HOW.
>> WHEN SENATOR COLLINS WAS
UNLIKELY TO FINALLY STARE DOWN
THIS ANGRY MOB AND SAY THIS IS
MORE THAN ONE POLITICAL FIGHT,
THIS IS ABOUT FAIRNESS.
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO
BE THE MANTRA OF REPUBLICANS
GOING FORWARD?
>> IT SHOULD BE, IT HAS TO BE.
>> TRYING TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY
BACK.
FOR SO LONG WE ALLOW DEMOCRATS,
LIBERALS TO CONTROL THE
NARRATIVE AND THE PROCESS.
WE HAVE TO MAN UP AND STAND UP
AND STOP ALLOWING THESE PEOPLE
TO DISMANTLE THIS COUNTRY.
>> SHOUT PEOPLE DOWN WITH
RACIST, SEXIST --
>> THIS HAPPENS WHEN YOU MAN UP
OR STAND UP, WHAT THE WOMEN'S
RIGHTS TWEETED ABOUT WHO SENATOR
COLLINS IS.
SHE MADE A POWERFUL REASONED
SPEECH AND THEY SAID SENATOR
COLLINS IS A RAPE APOLOGIST.
THAT IS HOW THEY VIEW SOMEONE
WHO WAS VERY RESPECTFUL IN HER
REMARKS.
IS ANYTHING GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE
LEFT?
>> NOTHING EVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR
THEM, NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING.
WHAT WE DO IS IGNORE THEM AND
WHEN THEY ARE PROTESTING IN THE
STREET WE NEED TO FORM A PROTEST
AND VOTE THESE PEOPLE OUT AND
VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS.
TODAY BRETT KAVANAUGH, TOMORROW
YOUR BROTHER, US, YOUR FATHER,
YOUR SON.
I DON'T LIKE WHAT I SAW HERE.
ANYBODY CAN BE ACCUSED OF
SOMETHING AND IF THEY DEFEND
THEMSELVES, THAT IS NOT RIGHT.
>> WHAT IT DOES TO THE MIDTERMS
--
>> YOU WILL SEE A RED TSUNAMI.
>> A RED TSUNAMI.
DEMOCRATS ARE UPSET ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED TO THIS MAN.
IF YOU ARE A MINORITY WE ARE
PART OF THE MAJORITY BECAUSE WE
ARE AMERICANS.
IF YOU ARE BLACK IN THIS COUNTRY
YOU SHOULD BE STANDING WITH
BRETT CAVANAGH.
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE WHEN
SOMEBODY ACCUSES YOU OF
SOMETHING.
>> YOU SERVE TIME FOR IT.
>> LET ME TELL YOU WHAT OUR
SHARPTON SAID.
THESE PEOPLE WOULD GO TO CHURCH
AND THEN GO TO THE LYNCHING.
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE
TODAY.
>> THE DRAMA WAS AROUND DOCTOR
FORD, BRETT KAVANAUGH.
>> OUR SHARPTON IS ONE OF THE
GATEKEEPERS OF WHAT WE CALL THE
DEMOCRAT PARTY, THE DEMOCRATIC
PLANTATION.
HE KNOWS THE DOG WHISTLES AND
WHAT TO USE.
HE NEEDS TO TALK ABOUT THE PARTY
OF SLAVERY OF THE PARTY OF JIM
CROW.
>> PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION.
>> IS SHARPTON IN YOUR MOVIE?
MONDAY.
>> A WEEK FROM MONDAY.
WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT IS
DRAINING THE SWAMP AND WE ARE
EXPOSING THE HYPOCRISY ON THE
LEFT.
YOU SAY YOU WANT TO IMPEACH 45,
THIS IS RUN DOWN.
>> HOW DO WE SEE IT?
>> DEMOCRATS THE MOVIE.COM, GET
YOUR TICKETS AND TELL YOU WHAT
LOCATIONS IN YOUR AREA.
IT IS IN THEATERS NATIONWIDE.
>> THE DEMOCRATS OF LONG BEEN IN
CHARGE.
>> WE ARE GIVING YOU PROOF.
>> GIVING IT TO YOU STRAIGHT
FROM THE GATE.
>> YOU LADIES, WE LOVE HAVING
YOU ON THIS COUCH.
