- Hey everyone, it's me Hallease,
endeavoring to preserver as always.
Coming at you in San Francisco, California
from my hotel room; not the
usual setup as you can see.
I am here for the Climate Summit.
I'm helping Jouelzy produce
content on her channel,
so I'm on my best videography,
cinematography grind.
You know what I'm saying, out here doing
your digital storytelling grind, Amen.
I'm just really excited and
grateful for this opportunity.
Thank you Jouelzy, you're
the best, love you girl.
And we just got back
from Klamath, California
which is where the Yurok tribe,
a Native American tribe
here in the United States,
has their territory and
they've partnered with
the local California government
to maintain the forests,
and so it was really cool
because we got to talk to them
and see the areas that
they maintain together.
And also there were a lot of
different indigenous peoples
from all over the world that came too,
to sort of, kind of like, have
their own sort of mini summit
if you will, and talk
about was they can take
what the Yurok Tribe is
doing here in California,
and transfer that back to their
own territories and areas.
That content will be coming
out on Jouelzy's channel,
and I'm really just
happy to be a part of it,
and I'm happy she thought
of me as a collaborator
for this project with her, and yeah.
I'm just, you know yeah, I'm just happy
to be here you know what I mean?
(laughs)
Which brings me to my
next point; I hit 13k.
I noticed, I think around
last week that I broke 13k,
and I don't know why this
feels like a milestone,
but it does; it feels
like a milestone to me.
For all the people that are subscribed
to the channel so far, thank you so much
for sticking around and
commenting and sharing and liking.
I really enjoy reading the comments.
Like I make the videos, one,
for myself to catalog my life,
but then also again, to engage with y'all,
and to get to know y'all,
and have conversations
around different topics,
and tell stories and all
of that so yeah, you know.
Please always comment;
I read all the comments.
And thank you for the people
that have been rolling
with me for a while,
I recognize names in the
comments, of people that comment
and I know like some of
these names it's like,
dang you been rolling with me
since I was like at 5k though.
Or since I was like at 2k, you know.
So it's really cool to
see how much some of y'all
have grown and how, you
know, in correspondence
to how I have grown, and it's
just like it's a community.
You know, it really is
an engaging community
that I just love being a part of.
So yeah, thank you for being here.
And if you're new here, welcome.
And so yeah, in celebration of that,
there's a sale on the merch.
So if you've been following me since
the beginning of the year you know
that this year my only resolution
was to be a chaotic good,
and just try to not focus so much
on all the individual things
and just try to create
for the sake of creating, and you know,
just be here there and
everywhere, Amen, you know?
Be In the world, but
not of it if you will.
You know what I'm saying,
and I feel like I have
been doing that you know.
Every now and then I have
to remind myself though,
to not get so bogged down to details
and not be so like,
"what's my five year plan,
what's my other plan?" you know,
and just roll with where God is taking me,
you know what I'm saying,
just be open to it.
So yeah, in order to keep that in mind,
I decided to work with one
of my favorite designers,
Anastasia, and we together came up with
this design for my resolution
for 2018, be a chaotic good,
and I really love the design
and I really love this sweater.
I've been wearing it
while I was in Klamath,
now we're here in San Francisco
and I'm going to be wearing it.
It's so cozy because
it's Bella and Canvas,
so it's like, it's the good
stuff, you know what I mean.
But yeah if you're interested
in getting a sweatshirt,
I have tee shirts, and I think
I also have pillow cases as well.
If you're interested
in getting any of that,
it's probably actually below this video,
but also teespring.com/stores/hallease.
And for the month of September
I have a code launch18,
where you can get 15% off your purchase,
and it's only through
the month of September,
and then it will be back to regular price.
So if you were like,
waiting to execute on merch,
if you were just waiting,
you were waiting for a sale,
this the time, this the
sale, so head on over there
if you're interested in
getting a shirt, sweater.
I have cell phone cases,
pillow cases as well, and mugs.
Yeah that's really it; I
just really wanted to get on
and just say thank you
for helping me hit 13k.
I really appreciate it.
Sorry that I kind of haven't
been sticking to the schedule,
because I was prepping for this project,
and now I'm on this project,
and then I've also been working
on wrapping up my Creators
for Change project.
So it's been a lot going on so I kind of
had to be a little more loose
with the video schedule,
but hopefully by the end of September,
I'll be back to regularly
scheduled programming if you will.
And then also, from the Patreon producers,
I will be scheduling our next
livestream together soon.
So make sure to check me
out Patreon.com/Hallease.
I'll be sending out some
dates on when we can do
our next livestream and
hang out session together.
If you don't already know,
with the Patreon producers,
every month I do a private livestream,
and then it goes live on
the channel after the fact,
so you don't get to be live
in it, you see it after.
In order to be live in it, and
know when it's going to be,
and get a private link to join,
you need to be a Patreon
producer of the channel,
and my Patreon's super
basic, it's two dollars.
Two dollars.
(laughs)
And the two dollars is like, a suggestion.
Literally you can give whatever
you want and you're in.
So, it's super basic.
But yeah, you get early access to videos,
the private livestreams with me.
Oh, Patreon producers will always
and forever get 20% off merch,
and they have their own
private code for that,
that will never go away, so yeah.
If you're interested,
Patreon's where it's at.
That's how you really can
stay in contact with me,
get input on video ideas
and things like that.
So it's just like a better way
to just like stay direct
in contact with me.
You also get a private
Facebook group too, so.
So if you're interested,
and if the spirit moves you,
consider joining the
Patreon production team.
It's a cool bunch; cool
bunch of folks over there.
Just saying; just throwing that out there.
And yeah, I think that's kind of it.
That's kind of it, y'all.
I'm sorry, I really, man
it is hard to balance
this freelancer life with everything else,
but I really am anxious.
I really just wanted to put something out.
Like seriously, it really does bother me
when a week has gone by, and
I haven't talked to y'all.
Like it really irks me,
you know what I'm saying?
Oh, in the comments below,
let me know when you first
started following me.
What was my subscriber
count, because, I just,
let's be nostalgic, if you
will for a little while.
But yeah, because I am
still kinda in limbo,
I'll see you when I see you.
(calm music)
