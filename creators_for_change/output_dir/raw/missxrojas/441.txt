00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
some time ago on digg i think it was

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,380
there was a picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a little story</font>

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,150
about a sushi bar they had started

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,189
serving Rick rolls after a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> day at</font>

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,440
work today<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on my way back I started</font>

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,580
thinking about all the other things that

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,650
I would serve in my ideal food

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,450
establishment now I start to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

9
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,460
sushi bars and sushi bar stuff say for

10
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,170
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was of course the Hank</font>

11
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,570
roll quickly followed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the giant squid</font>

12
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,160
roll which you could have in various

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,930
states of anger the various states of

14
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,580
anger would directly correlate with just

15
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,080
how spicy would say for example you

16
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,449
could have mild anger moderate anger

17
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:31,980
severe anger and then you could have the

18
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,600
giant squid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Rob just burn your mouth</font>

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,790
with its extreme rage and for Americans

20
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,010
I say Roth you<font color="#CCCCCC"> say wrath when i was in</font>

21
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">america and i went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to american sushi</font>

22
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,160
places they had this thing called a boat

23
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">i don't know if it's just in the sushi</font>

24
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,280
place near that's the college but you

25
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,050
can have sushi and a boat and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font>

26
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,160
have all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> types of sushi</font>

27
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,719
it would be a wide selection it's also

28
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally in this boat I think there</font>

29
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,140
would be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a boat special cord i'm on</font>

30
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,640
a boat where whenever you ordered it you

31
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,230
would have to stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and sing the</font>

32
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,699
first verse and chorus of the song

33
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">whether Lonely Island and it would be</font>

34
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">great fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure everyone in the</font>

35
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,410
restaurant would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> thrilled to have you</font>

36
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,750
instead of sake bombing or<font color="#CCCCCC"> llega bombing</font>

37
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,549
there would be photobombing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure</font>

38
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly how this would work if you do</font>

39
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,130
have any ideas do you leave them in the

40
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,750
comments may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be some kind of dropping of</font>

41
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,150
a shot glass made up of photographs into

42
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,950
a bigger glass I don't know I haven't

43
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,090
thought through the details<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

44
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,799
started to kind of deviate from the

45
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,270
sushi field and I thought about other

46
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,710
drinks that I just think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the wine</font>

47
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,200
cone which would be a cone filled with

48
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,640
wine that you could get it would be like

49
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,200
made of plastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something and then</font>

50
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,369
when you finish drinking it you could

51
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,530
put it on your head<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a hat and it</font>

52
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,450
would just double as a lovely souvenir

53
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,950
and a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put stuff on your head to</font>

54
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,360
make yourself feel happier but if you

55
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,680
were feeling really fancy say for

56
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,119
example you were there to celebrate an

57
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,070
engagement you could get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fine cone</font>

58
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,390
which would be one made out of crystal

59
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,860
which you could also put on your head

60
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,689
but might be slightly more expensive I'm

61
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,520
not thinking tiny little dainty cones

62
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,040
here I'm thinking big cones like goblets

63
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,320
but in cone shaped and they would have

64
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,820
little rings it as you could rest them

65
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,020
it I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought about this party month</font>

66
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,670
breakfast is always a popular option so

67
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">you could have breakfast LNG on which</font>

68
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,299
would be like a french<font color="#E5E5E5"> toast</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with some</font>

69
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,399
kind of sugary spread but<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut out in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

70
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,049
shape of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cats on a musical dish</font>

71
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,490
you're coming with a musical glass of

72
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,570
orange juice that would have caused

73
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pavin Yan song whenever you lifted it up</font>

74
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you guys remember those they used to</font>

75
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,399

00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:11,970
you know what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about it was</font>

79
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,319
great

80
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,730
stuff that you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> every day except to</font>

81
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">play</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this song and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it really annoyed</font>

86
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,549

going to be on but you won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> find out</font>

104
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,840
that for a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time because I'm</font>

105
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,549

110
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,079
in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also heard this idea which is</font>

111
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:08,419
peculiar coming from a vegetarian<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

112
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,189
that you could order french<font color="#CCCCCC"> llama</font>

113
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,079
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> ordered that then the waiter</font>

114
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:14,000
would call into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kitchen French the</font>

115
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,219
llama could have a like grilled llama

116
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:18,290
grilled in like garlic juice and it

117
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,049
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah some of us need</font>

118
00:03:21,049 --> 00:00:00,000
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some rest I think</font>
