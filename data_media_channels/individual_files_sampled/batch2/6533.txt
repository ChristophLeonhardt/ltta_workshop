Ron de santis who is running for governor in the state of Florida is cashing a little bit of heat because one of his uh big donors was caught saying some pretty terrible things about Obama on Twitter now when I say terrible things I'm talking about racist slurs so the man in question here is Steven Allen bukh and he had donated over $20,000 to Rhonda Santos's campaign now wrong DeSantis himself has said some pretty racist things in the past including urging the voters in Texas to avoid voting for his black opponent Andrew Gilliam because if they do vote for him they would monkey this thing up right that was a big debacle you accidently said Texas is so far Oh Florida I didn't realize I said Texas sorry I misspoke but yes this is in Florida so with that said though Steven Allen bukh again has donated over $20,000 to DeSantis and apparently he was responding to an RNC tweet about Obama speech where Obama was critical of Republicans and Allen Bukh responded with F the Muslim and you fill in the blanks about Obama about Obama now so first of all are we really having a conversation about whether he should return to 22,000 or you know I never understood the concept of returning the money to a bad guy give it to charity okay how do I give it to a charity for young African Americans in Florida I mean that's the least that the Sanders can do right well the Santa says camp has responded to those calls and they have said that they will not return the money or donate it to charity because they've already spent it oh I see because new money doesn't come in all the time like oh that money I happen to spend oh please that's not how it works okay so before we get to DeSantis because there's other stuff directly related to the DeSantis which we will discuss Alan bukh responded to the critics you know because he puts out that tweet calling Obama first of all Muslim and then secondly the N word and he acknowledged that he fired off this tweet and everything and it was in response to the RNC post that highlighted Obama's criticism that the GOP had become a party of resentment and paranoia let's note the irony there I know he's like Obama said there were party of resentment and paranoia so I'm gonna call him a Muslim n-word even though he's not Muslim and that's a terrible thing to say that sounds like you're resentful and a little paranoid that he's Muslim I mean the fact that he can't see that irony's unbelievable so it gets better though he claims that he is not racist oh of course he does despite the tweet he is not racist absolutely not a racist but used several slurs to complain that white people were held to what he believes is a double standard so let me give you his quote he says so somebody like Chris Rock can get up on stage and use the word and there's no problem but some white guy says it and he's a racist really I grew up in New York in the 50s I'm just gonna say what he said verbatim we were the kikes they were the ends they were the goyim and those were the spics okay so like yeah guess what we had different standards in the 1950s and those are all terrible things that shouldn't have even been used in the 1950s but I love how he's like yeah in the 1950s I got to go around calling people the n-word and no one had a problem with it yeah and I don't know if you know this they shouldn't called you the kikes that's not a good thing and we don't want to bring that back okay and and I don't know that anybody did in the 1950s I wouldn't be remotely surprised but now that you've called other people bad words you claim that 60 some odd years ago someone also called you a name wow that's a pretty good defense okay and and overall I mean it's amazing it reminds me of that again the Grand Wizard of the Klan interviewed and he says the N words are this and they're monkeys and they're not as smart as we are the guys like living trailer park and but he's got the world figured out and nothing wrong with living in trailer park but I don't know how you come off like hey I'm the superior race and all this stuff and then they ask him so you're racist he's like oh no why would you say that what do you mean you're in the Ku Klux Klan you just said black people were monkeys in that they're not smart so what he's like no I'm not racist and Allan Beck is like no I called him the N word and I called a Muslim and I called them all these things that he's not but um he said absolutely not racist yeah can I give you one other quote from a limbic that I thought was interesting because it kind of gives you a sense of the way he thinks ok the inconsistencies in his own head as he's making one statement when I write anything inflammatory it's because I'm seriously pissed off I'm an emotional human being do I have a filter on what I say in public yes would I use that word in public no this is Twitter oops I don't know if you know this Twitter is also public in fact it's more public than your local street corner like if you said in a street corner it might piss off a couple of people when you say it on Twitter it goes to millions of people it's widespread worldwide and he's like no no I just say it in public what he's trying to say is no I'm a good guy I think that they're the n-word but I wouldn't call it to their face because that would seem implied in person and I wouldn't want them to get angry but I'll call all of you the n-word all over Twitter because come on you are right and so anybody for the thousandth time Chris Rock does not do it to demean people he's not doing it to attack people he it's a completely different context I know the right-wing not very bright so they have trouble with context so whereas you specifically did it to demean Obama and to insult him because why cuz you said in your own words you were seriously pissed off you weren't like hey my n-word yes wouldn't be right either but you were like oh that Muslim n-word right I mean buddy says absolutely not racist okay so one final part of this story and this is an older story that we missed but I think it's important to bring it up in this context to give you a full picture of the types of people who support DeSantis so Andrew Gilliam is his opponent for the governor's race in Florida and Andrew Gilliam also happens to be black and so there was a robo call that went out immediately after Gilliam won in the primary and I want you to take a listen to it because this is not done by De Santis to be fair but it's a racist robo call from a Nazi group out of Idaho take a listen so there was more to the robo call that's just a piece of it but he's you know mocking him trying to he's in his racist mind he's trying to sound black right and there's jungle noises in the background and yeah in other parts of the tape the jungle noises are much louder and and clear and so look that one is as we clearly said less on DeSantis and then he condemns it etc and I don't know that he could do anything about random white supremacist in Idaho but they clearly when they saw the Santa's say you don't want to monkey this up it like that's our guy and having nothing to do with Florida at all they're like okay he's running against a black guy and he called him a monkey we're in and so they come in here but the the donation to DeSantis there's a lot he can do about it he's just choosing not to do it one more thing about that think about what's wrong with our campaign finance system anyone with God knows what motives can give to our politicians we don't have public financing where they would get a certain amount of money we'd have an even playing field and they can actually make their case to their voters no we have a system that allows for private financing and unlimited financing so any guy with it's oftentimes with financial motives comes and buys our politicians but in this guy in this case Alan bit can't apparently can't stand black people like Obama or Muslim people even though Obama's not Muslim but he's a bigot and a racist in a couple of different ways and he thinks oh good I'm gonna go get a favor from a politician and so the next time I need a politician to vote against Muslims to vote against black people I'm gonna call up DeSantis and go remember that $22,000 gave you you think politicians don't take that call they take that call and that's why private financing of our elections is crazy it allows anybody with any intent to go and buy all these politicians than ask them for favors and they're not working for us they're working for the Olympics of the world it's the whole system is gross thanks for watching this free clip of The Young Turks don't forget to become a TYT member today for more exclusive content join now at TYT calm slash join
