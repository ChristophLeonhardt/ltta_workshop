I think it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful</font>

about describing all Shia militias as

76

some of them are the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> powerful and</font>

77
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,840
that there's a strand of Iraqi Shia

nationalism which I think we should

95

discrepancy in material support to the
