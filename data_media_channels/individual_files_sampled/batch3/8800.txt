EVENT WITH RUMORS OF A POSSIBLE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RUN. PETE WHOSE NOT RUNNING IN 2020? PETE: EVERYONE. ALL RIGHT IT'S MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND AND OUR NEXT GUEST HAS A FOX NEWS OP-ED REMINDS US TO NEVER FORGET WHY WE CELEBRATE. HE WRITES THIS IN PART. "THIS MEMORIAL DAY, REMEMBER ME, THE FALLEN WARRIOR. REMEMBER WHAT I SACRIFICED, SO YOU CAN TRULY APPRECIATE THE INCREDIBLE TREASURES YOU HAVE. YOU HAVE THE JOYS OF LIFE, THE JOYS THAT I GAVE UP, THAT CAME FROM SACRIFICE, THE SUPREME SACRIFICE." THE AUTHOR OF THAT POWERFUL MESSAGE IS HERE FORMER NAVY SEAL JACK O WITH, JOCKO WILLINK, THE OFFER OF THE WAY OF THE WARRIOR, A FANTASTIC KIDS BOOK I'VE GOT A LITTLE NUGGET TO SHARON THAT BUT ADD-ON TO THAT WHY DID YOU WRITE THAT AND WHAT DOES MEMORIAL DAY MEAN TO YOU? WELL ONE OF THE BIGGEST PARTS I WANTED TO GET ACROSS IN THAT PIECE WAS TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THESE WARRIORS THAT WE REMEMBER TODAY THEY WEREN'T JUST WARRIORS THEY WEREN'T JUST SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIR MEN AND MARINES THEY WERE ALSO PEOPLE. THEY WERE HUMAN BEINGS THEY WERE HUSBAND'S AND WIVES AND SONS AND DAUGHTERS, THEY HAVE FAMILIES THEY HAD HOPED AND DREAMS AND SO IT'S NOT JUST THE CHARACTER THAT YOU PICTURE IN A MOVIE THAT'S WEARING A UNIFORM NO IT'S A REAL PERSON A PERSON LIKE YOU THAT SACRIFICED EVERYTHING FOR US. PETE: DO YOU FEEL LIKE TOO MANY HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT TODAY THAT ULTIMATELY IT'S ABOUT MATTRESS SALES AND BARBECUES? I LIVE IN A VERY STRONG MILITARY TOWN OF SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF MARINES AND SAILORS AND I THINK SAN DIEGO DOES A GREAT JOB IN REMEMBERING BUT AGAIN, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE REMEMBER THAT THESE SERVICEMEN THAT SACRIFICED THEMSELVES, THEY'RE PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR MY PERSPECTIVE. PETE: WELL, RAISING MEN WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE IS SOMETHING THAT PARENTS DO AND HOPEFULLY OUR CULTURE REINFORCES BUT WE'VE SEEN AN EXAMPLE RECENTLY THIS 30 YEAR OLD WAS EVICTED FROM HIS OWN HOUSE AND THE NORTH KOREA POST WROTE THIS OP-ED SAYING DEAD BEAT SON IS A SIGN OF AMERICA'S FAILURE TO RAISE BOYS IS THE HEADLINE. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THIS IS AN ABSURD EXAMPLE OF THIS 30 YEAR OLD WHO FOUGHT HIS OWN PARENTS TO STAY TO LIVE AT HOME BUT ARE WE FAILING OUR SONS BY FAILING TO TEACH THEM HOW TO BE MEN? WELL I CAN TELL YOU I STILL WORK WITH THE MILITARY AND THE MEN OUT THERE, THE YOUNG MEN IN THIS GENERATION. THEY'RE OUT THERE HOLDING THE LINE FAKE OUR FOR FATHERS DID SO I DON'T THINK YOU CAN'T LOOK AT THE WHOLE GENERATION AND SAY WE'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S CERTAINLY SOME CHANGES IN OUR CULTURE RIGHT NOW AND AS YOU MENTIONED IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I WROTE THE BOOK, THAT SERIES, BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOUNG BOYS AND GIRLS AND IT'S WRITTEN FOR BOTH THEY NEED TO BE TOLD THAT IT'S OKAY TO BE STRONG, THAT IT'S OKAY TO TRY AND WORK TO BE SMART, THAT HARD WORK IS GOING TO GET YOU SOMEWHERE IN LIFE AND PERSONAL DISCIPLINE GOES A LONG WAY. PETE: WELL JOCKO, YOU'VE AFFECTED MY OWN LIFE AND MY OWN SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BOY BECAUSE HE LOVED DIARY OF A WIMPY KID. IT'S A FUN BOOK AND HERE IS A PICTURE OF MY OLDEST SON GUNNER JUST THIS MORNING, WAY OF THE WARRIOR KID HE'S NOT FAKING IT HALF WAY THROUGH AND ONLY HAD IT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. WHAT IS THE KEY MESSAGE YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO BOYS LIKE GUNNE R WHOSE SEVEN WHO SAYS YOU DON'T NEED TO BE WIMPY BUT A WARRIOR. I THINK THAT'S YOUR PARENTS AS WELL. IF YOU RAISE YOUR KIDS TO BE TO BE CAPABLE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE BETTER LIVES. THE MORE DISCIPLINE THEY HAVE THE MORE FREEDOM THEY HAVE AS WELL AND THAT'S THE MESSAGE I'M TRYING TO PUT ACROSS TO KIDS. PETE: ABSOLUTELY AND A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN THE WOMEN PI KID SERIES? YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WIMPY KID SERIES I DIDN'T WANT TO BE RAISING ANY WIMPY KIDS IN MY HOUSE. PETE: I AGREE AND WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO AN OBSTACLE COURSE BUT IT'S RAINING SO WE MIGHT NOT GET TO IT I HAVE A FEELING YOU WOULD HAVE EXECUTED IT ANYWAY IS THAT FAIR? DON'T LET THAT RAIN STOP YOU PETE. PETE: I'M TRYING I NEED HELP.
