EMILY: I'M EMILY CHANG AND THIS
IS "BLOOMBERG WEST."
JOB CUTS AT CISCO.
WE DIVE INTO THE LATEST EARNINGS
REPORT AND SEE HOW THE LEGACY
TECH COMPANY IS WEATHERING THE
CHANGING WIND OF THE NETWORKING
INDUSTRY.
PLUS HE'S THE GODFATHER OF THE
INTERNET.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHO SHOULD
REGULATE THE WEB.
AND MY REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ARE
PUTTING UP A FIGHT.
AND ANOTHER BLOCKBUSTER QUARTER,
WILL LOOK AT WHETHER CHINA IS
THE CONTENT KING.
FIRST, TO THE LEAD, CISCO SHARES
DIPPING IN AFTER HOURS ON NEWS
IT WILL CUT 5500 JOBS, ABOUT 7%
OF THE WORKFORCE.
IT UNDERSCORES THE COMPANY
STRUGGLED TO ADAPT AS THE
NETWORKING INDUSTRY SHIFTS
TOWARD SOFTWARE-BASED SYSTEMS
AND UNDERCUTS SALES GROWTH.
THE COMPANY'S FOURTH-QUARTER
PROFITS BEAT ESTIMATES AT $.62 A
SHARE.
JOINING ME IS CORY JOHNSON AND
ON THE PHONE, BRIAN WHITE OF
DREXEL HAMILTON.
COREY, I WILL START WITH YOU.
CISCO HAS HAD A LOT OF JOB CUTS
OVER THE YEARS.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE
ADDITIONAL NUMBERS?
CORY: IT'S ONE OF THE WORST
THINGS ANYONE CAN EVER GO
THROUGH, LOSING A JOB.
IN TERMS OF WHAT IT MEANS FOR
CISCO'S BUSINESS, THEY'VE CUT A
COUPLE THOUSAND WORKERS EVERY
ONE OF THE LAST THREE YEARS.
THIS IS THE WAY THEY ARE DOING
THINGS RIGHT NOW, SORT OF
BLOODLETTING, WHICH IS HORRIBLE
FOR THE PEOPLE INVOLVED.
IT'S MORE ABOUT FOCUSING ON
PLACES THEY WANT TO BE FOCUSED
AND NOT IN PLACES WHERE THEY
HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST.
EMILY: BRIAN, WOULD YOU AGREED
WITH THAT?
HOW SHOULD WE MAKE SENSE OF
THIS?
>> I THINK WAR HE IS EXACTLY
RIGHT.
CISCO HAS TO EVOLVE WITH THE
TIMES.
MORE BUSINESS IS SHIFTING INTO
THE CLOUD.
THEY ARE MAKING A BIG PUSH INTO
SECURITY.
IF YOU HAVE WORKERS THAT ARE
FOCUSED ON LEGACY PRODUCTS,
THERE'S NOT MUCH WORK FOR THEM.
LOOK AT THEIR SWITCHING OR
ROUTING BUSINESSES, THEY ARE
DECLINING OR SLIGHTLY GROWING.
THERE'S NOT MUCH GROWTH THERE
ANYMORE.
THE NEWER AREAS THEY ARE
INVESTING IN, THEY JUST GOT INTO
ANALYTICS A COUPLE OF MONTHS
AGO.
THOSE ARE EXAMPLES.
EMILY: WHEN YOU LOOK AT LEGACY
PRODUCT GROWTH, HOW FAST OUR
SALES UP THERE LEGACY PRODUCTS?
CORY: OVERALL THE REVENUE
NUMBERS ARE DOWN 2%.
IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR VIDEO
BUSINESS WHICH THEY GOT RID OF A
YEAR AGO, SALES WERE UP 2%.
ALL THE EXISTING PRODUCT LINES
ON AVERAGE WERE UP 2%.
THE SWITCHING BUSINESS IS UP 3%
YEAR OVER YEAR.
THE SECURITY BUSINESS WAS UP 16%
ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BUSINESS, SO
TERRIFIC GROWTH INSECURITY.
IT'S WORTH THINKING ABOUT IN
THIS TIME IN WHICH THE CUTTING
EDGE TECHNOLOGY OF SWITCHES IS A
SOFTWARE DEFINED NETWORK.
CHOOSING ONE SWITCH OR ROUTER
AND USING SOFTWARE TO DO THE JOB
OF MANY ROUTERS.
IN AN ERA WHEN SOFTWARE DEFINED
NETWORKS ARE LETTING IT GET MORE
OUT OF INDIVIDUAL SWITCHES AND
ROUTERS, THESE NUMBERS REALLY
ARE NOT THAT BAD.
EMILY: THEY GONE THROUGH A BIG
LEADERSHIP CHANGE OVER THE LAST
YEAR.
I SAT DOWN WITH THE NEW CEO
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WHO TOOK
OVER FOR JOHN CHAMBERS.
HE STILL THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN.
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF
MANAGEMENT TURNOVER AT THE TOP
OF CISCO.
I ASKED WHY IS THAT HAPPENING.
LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.
>> WE HAD TO MOVE FORWARD AND
THE THING WE DON'T WRITE
ARTICLES ABOUT ARE ALL THE
PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL HERE.
JOHN DEVELOPED A TREMENDOUS
BENCH AND WE WENT THROUGH THIS
DISCUSSION WHEN I FIRST TOOK THE
JOB.
ANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND
WHAT I ASKED THEM FOR WAS TO
COMMIT TO THREE YEARS.
SEVERAL HAD ASPIRATIONS TO
BECOME CEOS, AND MANY HAVE
BECOME CEOS, WHICH ON VERY HAPPY
ABOUT.
BUT THE BENCH THAT WAS CREATED
ALLOWED US TO BUILD THE
NEXT-GENERATION LEADERSHIP TEAM
THAT HAS PUT US IN A POSITION TO
EXECUTE MORE EFFECTIVELY IN THE
FUTURE.
EMILY: BRIAN, HOW WOULD YOU RATE
THE JOB THAT CHUCK ROBBINS IS
DOING SO FAR IN TERMS OF FILLING
JOHN CHAMBERS LEGENDARY SHOES?
BRIAN: HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB.
HE IS AN OPERATIONS MASTER.
IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR OPERATING
MARGINS IS QUARTER AT 31.4%, IT
WAS THE HIGHEST SINCE THE SECOND
QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006.
THAT'S WHAT HE IS KNOWN FOR.
GREAT MARGIN NUMBERS THIS
QUARTER.
CORY: GROSS MARGINS FOR THIS
LARGELY HARDWARE MAKING COMPANY
OR OF AROUND 65%.
IN FIVE OF THE LAST SEVEN
QUARTERS, GROSS MARGINS HAVE
RISEN ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS.
THAT SHOWS OPERATIONAL STRENGTH
AND THE BENEFIT THESE LAYOFFS
HAVE PROVIDED FOR CISCO.
EMILY: DO YOU THINK THESE NEW
BUSINESSES THEY ARE INVESTING IN
WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PICK UP
THE SLACK?
BRIAN: DEFINITELY.
IF YOU LOOK AT RECURRING REVENUE
, IT'S UP FROM 25% A YEAR AGO.
IF YOU LOOK AT DEFERRED REVENUE
AND SOFTWARE AND SUBSCRIPTIONS
IT WAS UP 33% YEAR OVER YEAR.
MARGINS SHOULD GO UP OVER TIME
FOR SURE.
EMILY: CISCO WAS A BELLWETHER OF
THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY AND ITS
LOSS THAT ICONIC STATUS, BUT
WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE PLACE FOR
CISCO IN THE BROADER PICTURE
NOW?
WHY IS CISCO STILL IMPORTANT?
CORY: IT'S HARDWARE IS LESS
IMPORTANT IN THE ERA OF THE
CLOUD.
THEY'RE USING AMAZON WEB
SERVICES, AND YET WHEN YOU LOOK
AT WHAT CISCO HAS BEEN ABLE TO
DO, CISCO HAS REMAINED RELEVANT
WHEN ITS COMPETITORS HAVE NOT.
WHEN HEWLETT-PACKARD, DELL, IBM
ARE FALLING APART, I THINK IT'S
WORTH NOTING THAT CISCO IS
SELLING HARDWARE IN ADDITION TO
SOFTWARE INSECURITY, IT'S
SUCCEEDING WHERE ITS COMPETITORS
HAVE NOT.
EMILY: WE DON'T WANT TO HARP ON
THE STOCK PRICE BUT 1999-2000 IS
WHEN CISCO REALLY HE -- REALLY
PEAKED, AND THE SHARES HAVE NOT
MOVED MUCH IN THE PAST DECADE
AND A HALF.
BRIAN: THE STOCK CAN BE RE-RATED
HERE.
THEY'VE GOT THIS GREAT DIVIDEND
YIELD, 3.4%.
PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT MARGINS AND
SAY THEY ARE GOING HIGHER, NOT
LOWER, WHICH IS VERY STRANGE FOR
WEB PEOPLE, IT'S BECOMING MORE
AND MORE SOFTWARE.
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS, THIS
COMPANY HAS GROWN 7% EURO THE
PAST FIVE YEARS.
IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THESE
SUGAR WATER AND DETERGENT
COMPANIES, THEY'VE GROWN 2% YOUR
FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS.
THEY TRADE AT 22 TIMES EARNINGS.
CISCO IS BECOMING SO IMPORTANT
TO THE I.T. WORLD AND HAS A
GREAT DIVIDEND NOW, PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO GIVE IT A BETTER
MULTIPLE.

MONSTER VALUATION?
ONE EXPERT SAYS NO.
HE CRUNCHED THE NUMBERS AND SAYS
THEY SHOULD BE VALUED AT SOUTH
OF $30 BILLION, LESS THAN HALF
OF THE 62 $.5 BILLION VALUATION
IT CURRENTLY HAS.
THE MAIN REASON HE SAYS IS
PROFIT.
HE SAYS DISRUPTION IS EASY BUT
MAKING MONEY OFF DISRUPTION IS
DIFFICULT.
RIDESHARING COMPANY STILL HAVE
NOT FIGURED OUT A WAY TO CONVERT
REVENUES INTO PROFIT.
HE SAID THAT OTHER BIG PUBLIC
MARKET PLAYERS COULD STILL JUMP
IN AS CHALLENGERS TO THE
COMPANY.
THE GOOGLER VALUATION IS HIGHER
THAN 80% OF THE COMPANY'S IN THE
S&P 500, HIGHER THAN GM AND
FORD.
COMING UP, A LONG SIMMERING BUT
HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION,
WHOSE JOB SHOULD IT BE TO GOVERN
THE INTERNET?
WE WILL DISCUSS WITH ONE OF THE
WEB'S FOUNDING FATHERS, NEXT.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
♪
EMILY: WHO CONTROLS THE
INTERNET?
UNTIL NOW THE JOB HAS LARGELY
BELONG TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT,
SPECIFICALLY, THE COMMERCE
DEPARTMENT.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
ORGANIZED A LONG PLANNED MOVE TO
SHIFT IT TO A STAKEHOLDER MARKET
ON OCTOBER 1.
FACEBOOK, AMAZON, AND MICROSOFT
ARE AMONG THE BIG TECH COMPANIES
SUPPORTING THE MOVE BUT OTHERS
ARE PUTTING UP A FIGHT.
I SAT DOWN WITH THE SO-CALLED
GODFATHER OF THE INTERNET AND
ASK THEM TO EXPLAIN WHY THIS
TRANSFER OF POWER IS SO
IMPORTANT.
>> IN FACT IT WAS PLANNED TO DO
THIS.
IN 1998 WHEN WE WERE CREATED TO
FORM THE FUNCTION, THE PLAN WAS
TO TURN OVER ALL RESPONSIBILITY
TO THOSE FUNCTIONS WITHIN TWO OR
THREE YEARS.
IT'S NOW 18 YEARS LATER.
THE ORGANIZATION HAS PERFORMED
WELL.
THE INTERNET HAS NOT COLLAPSED.
ITS FUNCTIONS HAVE TAKEN CARE OF
THE DOMAIN NAMES SYSTEM,
PARAMETERS OF THE INTERNET
PROTOCOL.
IT'S TIME TO SHOW THAT THE
INTERNET DOES NOT REQUIRE
GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT.
WHAT IT REQUIRES IS OPERATION BY
THE PRIVATE SECTOR TOGETHER WITH
ALL THE OTHER ENTITIES.
THAT IS WHY A MULTI-STAKEHOLDER
OPERATION IS IMPORTANT.
EMILY: OPPONENTS SAY IT COULD
HURT BUSINESSES AND PUT NATIONAL
SECURITY AT RISK.
COULD HURT U.S. BUSINESSES OR
GOOGLE?
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
IF ANYTHING, THIS IS THE RIGHT
THING TO DO.
UNDER THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES
WHERE THE GOVERNMENT HAS A SMALL
BUT VISIBLE OVERSIGHT ROLE,
OTHER GOVERNMENTS LOOK AT THAT
AND ASKED WHY SHOULD THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT HAVE THIS SPECIAL
POSITION?
IT'S NOT NECESSARY ANYMORE, NOT
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.
IT'S REFORMED ITSELF SEVERAL
TIMES AND AT THIS STAGE OF THE
GAME IS MORE HARMFUL TO PERSIST
IN THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP THAN
TO SHOW THAT A MULTI-STAKEHOLDER
SYSTEM, INCLUDING ALL THE
GOVERNMENTS, NOT JUST THE UNITED
STATES, IS THE WAY FORWARD.
EMILY: WHAT HARM COULD THERE BE
IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DOES
CONTINUE TO OVERSEE IT AS IS?
>> IT HAS A VERY SEVERE IMPACT
BECAUSE OTHER GOVERNMENTS THAT
FEEL THE U.S. SHOULD NOT HAVE
THIS PARTICULARLY SPECIAL
POSITION ARE GOING TO WORK VERY
HARD TO FRAGMENT THE INTERNET,
TO INSIST THAT THEY CONTROL MORE
OF IT THAN THEY DO TODAY.
GOVERNMENTS TODAY HAVE A LOT OF
CONTROL ON WHAT GOES ON IN THE
INTERNET INSIDE OF THEIR
INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS.
WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF
ITS WHAT HAPPENS TO EVERYBODY
ELSE'S PIECES OF THE INTERNET.
THE OTHER GOVERNMENTS WILL FEEL
THE NEED TO INCREASE THEIR
CONTROL ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
SO I THINK BY STEPPING AWAY FROM
THIS FINALLY, WE ACTUALLY REMOVE
A LOT OF THAT PRESSURE TO MAKE
IT MUCH MORE EGALITARIAN.
EMILY: ASSUMING THIS DOES HAPPEN
AS PLANNED, WHAT WILL BE
DIFFERENT?
WILL INDIVIDUAL USERS EVEN
NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE?
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.
THE CURRENT ROLE THAT THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT HAS IS TO VERIFY THAT
THE CHANGES TO THE ROOT ZONE OF
THE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM HAVE BEEN
PROPERLY CATERED FOR IN THE
PROCESSES THAT LEAD UP TO THOSE
CHANGES.
A ROUTER NEEDS TO BE POINTED TO
A DIFFERENT IP ADDRESS, AND THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IS MERELY
TO CHECK THAT IT'S BEEN
PERFORMED WITH DUE DILIGENCE,
THAT'S ALL.
WHEN THEY STEP AWAY FROM THAT
PARTICULAR FUNCTION, ALL THE
MECHANICS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME,
EXCEPT WE WON'T GO THROUGH THIS
LOOP, OTHERWISE IT IS EXACTLY
THE SAME.
EMILY: AS ONE OF THE FATHERS OF
THE INTERNET, I KNOW THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE CONSIDERED TO BE.
HAD HE THINK OVERSIGHT OF THE
INTERNET HAS PLAYED OUT OVER THE
LAST COUPLE OF DECADES AND HOW
DO YOU EXPECT IT TO PLAY OUT
OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES?
>> FOR THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING
AND LISTENING, THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT WAS THE ORIGIN OF
THIS PROJECT.
IT STARTED IN THE DEFENSE
DEPARTMENT, AND I'M VERY PROUD
NOT ONLY OF THE DEFENSE
DEPARTMENT BUT OTHER PARTS OF
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING
THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION,
FOR PERSISTENTLY STEPPING AWAY
FROM CONTROL OVER THE SYSTEM AND
TURNING IT OVER TO A
MULTI-STAKEHOLDER OPERATION.
WHEN WE WERE IN THE DEFENSE
DEPARTMENT, WE BASICALLY MADE
THE PRIMARY DECISIONS AND POLICY
ON WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INTERNET
THAT EXPANDED TO MULTIPLE PARTS
OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT,
INCLUDING NASA AND MSF AS WELL
AS THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY.
STEP BY STEP, THE GOVERNMENT HAS
WITHDRAWN FROM ITS CONTROL
OVERSIGHT, AND THIS IS THE LAST
STEP.
EMILY: THERE HAS BEEN TALK THAT
THE INTERNET HAS BECOME TOO BIG.
IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THE INTERNET
TO BECOME TOO BIG, TO RUN OUT OF
IP ADDRESSES AND DOMAIN NAMES?
>> WE CERTAINLY WON'T RUN OUT OF
DOMAIN NAMES.
WE HAVE AUTHORIZED THE CREATION
OF SOME 2000 DOMAIN NAMES, IN
ADDITION TO THE SEVEN WE STARTED
WITH ACT IN THE MID-1980'S.

BECAUSE THAT MEANS ALSO IT'S
HIGH ECONOMIC IMPACT FOR THE

MORE IMPORTANT IS HOW WE ARE

TOURISTS TO THE CITY OF RIO, AND
YOU CAN SEE ALREADY FOR THE
81,000 GUEST ARRIVALS THAT IT'S
REALLY A VERY GREAT EXPERIENCE

EMILY: AIRBNB IS THE OFFICIAL
ALTERNATIVE, ROCK ACCOMMODATIONS
PROVIDER FOR THE OLYMPICS.
HOW EARLY DID YOU START TALKING
WITH THE IOC IN BRAZIL ABOUT
MAKING THIS HAPPEN?
>> THE PARTNERSHIP WITH RIO 2016
IS A CONSEQUENCE OF A VERY
IMPORTANT CHAPTER SINCE 2015
DURING THE WORK UP.
WE RECEIVE GUESTS FROM ALL OVER
THE WORLD AND A VERY POSITIVE
WAY.
AIRBNB IS A GREAT SOLUTION FOR

THEIR CAPACITY.
THE CONVERSATION HAPPENED

EMILY: YOU WERE UP AGAINST A
COUPLE OF OTHER LOCAL
ACCOMMODATION PROVIDERS AND
THERE'S NO ACTUAL HISTORY OF
THERE BEING AN OFFICIAL
ACCOMMODATIONS ALTERNATIVE.
WHAT DID IT TAKE TO CLOSE THAT
DEAL WITH BRAZIL?
>> I THINK THE CITY OF RIO IS
THE CITY THAT PRESENTED AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALTERNATIVE
ACCOMMODATIONS BECAUSE THERE ARE
SO MANY PEOPLE ALREADY
INTERESTED IN COMING TO THE GAME

WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CAPACITY, YOU
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE
THOSE PEOPLE HERE FOR THE GAMES.

FIRST OF ALL, IT'S BEEN A YEAR
NOW AT INDEX.
WHAT HAS THE TRANSITION BEEN
LIKE AND HOW HAS YOUR EXPERIENCE
AT DROPBOX IMPACTED YOUR STYLE
OF INVESTING?
>> IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLE YEAR.
WE'VE HAD ABOUT 10 INVESTMENT SO
FAR, WHICH HAS BEEN REPORTING
FOR ME ACROSS THE BOARD.
THE BIGGEST THINGS I THINK ABOUT
ARE TWOFOLD, AS AN INVESTOR THE
MOST IMPORTANT THING IS
IDENTIFYING GREAT OPPORTUNITIES.
HAVING BEEN AT DROPBOX AND SEEN
THE PROBLEMS COMPANIES LIKE
DROPBOX FACE, BEING A NETWORK OF
GREAT IN -- INNOVATORS, YOU'RE
WORKING THROUGH A LOT OF
PROBLEMS.
WE BECOME CUSTOMERS OF SLACK AND
I'VE SEEN THE POTENTIAL.
IN THE CASE OF INTERCOM, WHAT
ARE THE THINGS THAT WAS
INTERESTING TO ME IS THE WAY IN
WHICH COMPANIES COMMUNICATE WITH
THEIR CUSTOMERS IS FUNDAMENTALLY
VERY DIFFERENT AND BROKEN
BECAUSE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE
THAT'S IN PLACE TODAY.
IT WAS A CLEAR OPPORTUNITY WHERE
I MUST INVEST, FOR ME.
I'D SEEN ALL THESE THINGS AND
KNOWN THAT COMPANIES I WANT TO
BE AN INVESTOR IN WHEN I CAME
OUT OF DROPBOX.
EMILY: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
CISCO, WHICH IS A LEGACY
ENTERPRISE PLAYER.
THINK WITH ENTERPRISE COMPANIES,
THERE'S ALWAYS A STRUGGLE
BETWEEN -- BETWEEN GIVING
CUSTOMERS WHAT THEY SHOULD WANT
AND WHAT THEY THINK.
HOW ARE YOU ADVISING THEM TO
MAKE SURE THEY'RE GIVING
CUSTOMERS WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW
THEY WANT?
YET?
>> I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY AT
DROPBOX TO GO FROM 50 TO 1500
PEOPLE.
RATHER THAN BEING PRESCRIPTIVE
IN SAYING WE DID THINGS THIS WAY
AND YOU SHOULD DO THEM THAT WAY,
I THINK THE RIGHT THING FOR ME
TO DO AS AN INVESTOR IS HELP
PEOPLE DO A FEW THINGS.
ONE IS LOOK AROUND THE CORNERS.
WHEN WE WENT FROM 50 TO 150 TO
500 TO 1000 PEOPLE, THESE ARE
THE PROBLEMS WE ENCOUNTERED AND
THESE ARE THE FRAMEWORKS WE USED
TO THINK ABOUT THINGS.
EVERY SIX MONTHS, YOU SHOULD
EVALUATE THE ORGANIZATIONAL
STRUCTURE BECAUSE YOU WILL BE
GOING REALLY CRAZY.
WHEN YOU MOVE FROM ALL BEING IN
ONE ROOM TO ALL BEING IN
DIFFERENT ROOMS IN DIFFERENT
OFFICES, YOU REALLY HAVE TO
INVEST IN COMMUNICATION.
IF THESE THINGS THAT YOU SEE ON
THE JOURNEY THAT YOU CAN THEN
TRANSLATE.
COMPANIES THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL,
THAT ARE GROWING THAT FAST, THEY
NEED TO TAKE DECADES OF
KNOWLEDGE AND COMPRESS THEM IN
TWO YEARS OR MONTHS.
I SEEING THINGS OURSELVES AND
WHAT OTHER COMPANIES DO IN
TRANSFERRING THAT KNOWLEDGE
EFFECTIVELY IS HOW WE HELP.
EMILY: IS DROPBOX EXPLORING AND
IPO?
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT
PLANS FOR THE COMPANY ARE.
YOU SEEM THAT THE COMPANY HAS
MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS IN
TERMS OF CUTTING COSTS AND
MOVING UP TO WEB SERVICES ON THE
INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE.
THE BUSINESS IS GROWING LIKE
NICELY WITH OVER 200,000 PAYING
BUSINESS CUSTOMERS.
IT JUST REPORTED BEING CASH FLOW
POSITIVE.
ALL THE METRICS ARE THERE.
IT'S UP TO THEM TO DECIDE WHEN
TO DO IT BUT CERTAINLY THE
EXTERNAL MARKETS ARE QUITE
POSITIVE TODAY.
EMILY: THERE IS CONCERN THAT THE
FILE SHARE MARKET IS NOT AS BIG
AS PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS AN
DROPBOX NEEDS TO INCREASE ITS
ADDRESSABLE MARKET.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT NEEDS TO
DO?
>> TO HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY.
YOU'RE ASKING HOW DO WE HELP.
ONE OF THE THINGS IS REALLY
UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU SHOULD
FOCUS ON AT A GIVEN TIME.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF
TECHNOLOGY, COMPANIES LIKE
MICROSOFT HAVE BECOME THESE
GIANTS WITH FULL PRODUCT SUITES.
DROPBOX IS AN INCREDIBLE
OPPORTUNITY TO GO INTO BUSINESS
AND TAKE A HUGE MARKET SHARE AND
ENTERPRISE INFRASTRUCTURE AND
STORAGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE
TECHNICAL KNOW-HOW TO DO THAT,
AND USE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO MOVE INTO PRODUCTIVITY.
THEY JUST LAUNCHED A PRODUCT
CALLED PAPER WHICH IS
PHENOMENAL.
I THINK THEY WILL SEE MORE AND
MORE OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THAT ON
TOP OF A FOUNDATIONAL BUSINESS
THAT'S GENERATING A LOT OF CASH.
EMILY: THERE'S A DRY SPELL IN
IPO'S AND THE TREND FOR
TECHNOLOGY IS TO STAY PRIVATE AS
LONG AS POSSIBLE.
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING YOUR
PORTFOLIO COMPANIES RIGHT NOW
ABOUT BEING IPO READY?
MARK ANDREESSEN SAID HE WAS
COACHING ALL OF HIS COMPANIES TO
BE IPO READY.
>> I THINK THIS HAS BEEN DRIVEN
A LOT BY MARKET CONDITIONS,
BEING CONTINUOUSLY READY NOT
JUST FOR IPO READINESS BUT FROM
A FUNDAMENTALS OF THE BUSINESS
PERSPECTIVE.
FOLKS ARE BECOMING A LOT MORE
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT PROFITABILITY,
ABOUT GROWING HEADCOUNT,
THINKING ABOUT WHAT TO FOCUS ON
AS A BUSINESS.
WE ARE ENCOURAGING HER COMPANIES
TO CONTINUOUSLY DO THAT.
IT IS JUST GENERALLY GOOD
HYGIENE.
YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN
PROFITABILITY AND BE IN A
POSITION OF STRENGTH.
YOU WANT TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT
HOW YOU SCALE THINGS, ESPECIALLY
ON THE COST SIDE.
EMILY: THE SECONDARY MARKET
WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO SEE
SOME SORT OF RETURN ON THEIR
INVESTMENT, THOSE HAVE REALLY
SHUT DOWN.
SOME COMPANIES ARE EXPERIMENTING
WITH WAYS TO GIVE SHARES TO
EMPLOYEES BEFORE THEY HAVE SOME
SORT OF ACQUISITION OR AN IPO.
WHAT IS YOUR PHILOSOPHY AROUND
THAT?
>> TALENT AND PEOPLE ARE THE
LIFEBLOOD OF COMPANIES.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES COMPANY
SUCCESSFUL AT EVERY STAGE.
DOING RIGHT BY YOUR EMPLOYEES
AND MAKING SURE THEY LIE INTO
THE MISSION GOALS OF THE COMPANY
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.
THE FINANCIAL REWARD IS A BIG
COMPONENT BUT ALSO JUST
UNDERSTANDING AND PERSONAL --
PERSONAL GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT.
WE ENCOURAGE OUR COMPANIES TO
FOCUS ON BOTH OF THOSE.
LIQUIDITY IS GOOD FOR EARLY
EMPLOYEES.
YOU WANT TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT
HOW YOU DO IT.
YOU DON'T WANT TO OVERDO IT.
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT LATER
EMPLOYEES FEEL GOOD AS WELL
ABOUT THINGS.
CERTAINLY FEW YOU CAN HELP
SOMEONE PAY DOWN THE MORTGAGE ON
THEIR HOUSE AND IF THERE'S A
GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT IN A

CUPCAKES TO FIGURE OUT WHOSE
BIRTHDAY IT IS.
IT SOUNDS REALLY SIMPLE, BUT
IT'S A SIMPLE PREMISE WHERE
GIRLS WANT TO GET ENGAGED
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO SOLVE THIS
PROBLEM.
EMILY: THE COLORS ARE PINK AND
PURPLE AND PASTEL.
IN SOME WAYS DO YOU WORRY ABOUT
REINFORCING?
SOME OF THESE GIRLS STEREOTYPES
-- REINFORCING?
GIRL?
STEREOTYPES >> WE WORKED REALLY
HARD ON THAT.
SHE FAILS AGAIN AND AGAIN, SHE
IS NOT A GENIUS.
SHE'S MORE LIKE A QUIRKY PEAVY
LONGSTOCKING.
GIRLS THINK SHE IS COOL, TOO.
THEY WANT TO BE HER FRIEND.
WE LOOK FOR EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO
PUT A TWIST ON THINGS.
ONE OF THE CHARACTERS IS
ACTUALLY A BOY, HE IS GOLDIE'S
NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR.
WE ARE REALLY BEING INCLUSIVE.
IT'S NOT GIRLS ONLY, IT IS OUR
EVERYBODY.
EMILY: DO YOU PLAN TO MAKE TOYS
FOR BOYS?
>> WE KEEP HEARING OVER AND OVER
AGAIN THAT BOYS LOVE PLAYING
WITH GOLDIEBLOX, AND WE ARE
EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
WE WANT EVERYBODY TO PLAY.
I AM ACTUALLY PREGNANT AND DUE
WITH A SON IN OCTOBER.
HOW GREAT WOULD IT BE FOR HIM TO
GROW UP THINKING THIS IS COOL
AND THAT GIRLS SHOULD BE
ENGINEERS TOO.
EMILY: YOU WON A SUPER BOWL
COMPETITION AND YOU GUYS ARE
PART OF A MOVEMENT IN THE
BROADER TOY INDUSTRY.
TARGET HAS GOTTEN RID OF GIRLS
AND BOYS TOYS AISLES.
AMAZON HAS DONE THE SAME.
WHAT MORE DOES THE INDUSTRY NEED
TO DO?
>> WE'VE COME A LONG WAY.
WHEN I FIRST LAUNCHED, I ALMOST
GOT LAUGHED OUT OF THE TOY FAIR
BECAUSE EVERYONE THOUGHT GIRLS
WOULD NOT LIKE BUILDING, THAT
GIRLS ONLY WANTED TO BE
PRINCESSES.
THE CONCEPT WENT VIRAL SO
QUICKLY, AND IT PROVED TO THE
INDUSTRY THAT GIRLS AND BOYS ARE
CHANGING.
IT'S NOT THE SAME 1950'S
STEREOTYPES.
PEOPLE DON'T WANT THAT ANYMORE.
A LOT HAS HAPPENED, LIKE YOU
SAID, AND THERE IS STILL A LOT
OF WORK TO DO.
EMILY: CHECK OUT SHARES OF
SHARP, UP 50% IN THE LAST WEEK.
THE RALLY FUELED BY NEWS THE
STOCK WILL BE ADDED TO THEM MAY
SEE THOSE ARE OFTEN USED BY THE
INDUSTRIAL INVESTORS.
THE DEAL WAS AGREED BACK IN
APRIL.
DESPITE THE RECENT RECOVERY,
SHARP SHARES ARE STILL AT LESS
THAN HALF THEIR 2014 HIGH.
COMING UP, THE BIG BET ON
CONTENT ACQUISITION.
WE WILL HEAD TO TOKYO TO BREAK
DOWN THE LATEST REPORT FOR ONE
OF ASIA'S BIGGEST INTERNET
GIANTS, NEXT.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
♪
EMILY: STILL HOLDING OUT HOPE
FOR A SPRINT T-MOBILE TIE UP.
THE BILLIONAIRE TELECOM MAGNATE
WOULD STILL LIKE THEM TO MERGE.
HE HAD CONSIDERED BUYING
T-MOBILE BUT ABANDONED THE IDEA
AFTER REGULATORS WERE NOT IN
FAVOR.
NOW HE MAY SEE A NEW OPENING.
PEOPLE SAY YOU MIGHT TRY AGAIN.
WE'LL PICK UP THIS THEME
TOMORROW WHEN WE HEAR FROM THE
T-MOBILE CEO.
FROM GAME OF THRONES TO NBA
BROADCAST, THE COMPANY HAS
DEFIED THE EFFECTS OF THE
SLOWING CHINESE ECONOMY.
SECOND QUARTER SALES AND PROFITS
BEAT ESTIMATES.
AD REVENUE SWELLED 60%.
JOINING ME FROM TOKYO IS OUR
TECH EDITOR.
WITH ALL THIS WITH ALIBABA AS
WELL.
IS THE TAKE AWAY THAT THE
CHINESE ECONOMY IS BETTER THAN
EVERYONE THINKS IT IS?
>> I'M NOT SURE THE OVERALL
ECONOMY IS BETTER THAN PEOPLE
THINK IT IS.
YOU'VE SEEN THE TWO BIGGEST
INTERNET COMPANIES IN CHINA BOTH
BEAT EXPECTATIONS PRETTY
HANDILY.
SEEING THESE TWO COMPANIES HAVE
FIGURED OUT HOW TO BRING IN THE
CHINESE CONSUMER AND GET THEM TO
SPEND ON CERTAIN KINDS OF
THINGS.
THERE ARE VERY DIFFERENT MODELS,
OF COURSE.
AMAZON IS PRIMARILY AN
E-COMMERCE COMPANY.
THEY'VE DONE WELL WITH THE
PREMIUM CONTENT, AS YOU MENTION.
THEY'VE INVESTED IN GAME OF
THRONES AND BRINGING NBA GAMES
INTO CHINA.
IN ADDITION TO THAT, THEY JUST
BOUGHT CONTROL OF SUPER CELL,
THE MAKER OF CLASH OF PLANS AND
THEY BEEN ABLE TO DO WELL AS
WELL.
IT'S LED TO A BIG INCREASE IN
ADVERTISING REVENUE.
BASED ON ALL OF THAT, WHERE DO
YOU THINK 10 SENT SPENDING WILL
GO FROM HERE?
WILL THEY PULL BACK OR CONTINUE
TO RAMP UP?
>> THEY LAID OUT A PRETTY GOOD
PLAN FOR EXPANSION.
THESE ARE NOT THAT WELL
UNDERSTOOD OUTSIDE OF THE
COUNTRY.
IT'S A SOCIAL NETWORKING
SERVICE, PAYMENT PLATFORM THAT
LETS YOU DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS.
WHEN TENCENT WANTS TO MARKET NEW
SHOWS OR GAMES THEY HAVE A GREAT
PLATFORM TO REACH EVIL IN CHINA
AND THEY BEEN ABLE TO CAPITALIZE
ON THAT TO DRIVE THIS CAN BOOMER
BUSINESS.
EMILY: TALK SO MUCH -- TO DRIVE
THEIR CONSUMER BUSINESS.
EMILY: WE TALK ABOUT THE DOOR
BEING SHUT ESSENTIALLY AND THE
SAME THING HAS HAPPENED FOR
CHINESE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES.
THEY'VE NOT HAD MUCH SUCCESS
EXPANDING INTO THE UNITED STATES
.
DO YOU THINK WE ARE SEEING A
CHANGING OF THE TIDES, WHERE
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO
BE THERE AMBITION IN THE FUTURE,
AND THEY REALLY WILL WILL BE
FOCUSED ON THE MARKET IN CHINA?
>> THERE IS BIFURCATION
CERTAINLY BETWEEN INSIDE CHINA
AND OUTSIDE OF CHINA, FOR MANY
DIFFERENT REASONS.
ALIBABA HAS BEEN MORE AGGRESSIVE
ABOUT TRYING TO OUT -- EXPAND
OUTSIDE OF CHINA.
THEY'RE DETERMINED TO GET MORE
THAN 50% OF THEIR REVENUE
OUTSIDE OF CHINA EVEN THOUGH
THERE FAR AWAY FROM THAT RIGHT
NOW.
FOR TENCENT, THEY BEEN FOCUSED
ON CHINA AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE
TO DO VERY WELL.
THEY DID NOT MAKE THE
ACQUISITION OF SUPER CELL WHICH
SIGNALS THAT THEY DO HAVE MOBILE
AMBITIONS.
THEY ARE MAKING LOTS OF
INVESTMENTS IN SMALL START UP SO
THEY MAY BE OLD TO DO THAT IN
THE FUTURE.
THEY'RE STILL PRIMARILY FOCUSED
ON THE CHINESE CONSUMER.
EMILY: OUR ASIA TAKE EDITOR
JOINING US FROM TOKYO, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR THAT UPDATE.
ONE STORY THAT'S TRENDING, APPLE
IS FUNDING A DOCUMENTARY WITH
CASH MONEY RECORDS, WHEN THE
WORLD'S MOST SUCCESSFUL HIP-HOP
LABELS.
APPLE HAS WANTED TO EXPAND ITS
CONTENT, WITH A SPIN OFF OF THE
POPULAR CARPOOL KARAOKE.
WE WILL BRING YOU MORE DETAILS
AS WE HAVE IT.
THAT DOES IT FOR THIS EDITION OF
"BLOOMBERG WEST."

>> OUR STUDIOS IN NEW YORK CITY,
THIS IS "CHARLIE ROSE."
CHARILE: WE CONTINUE OUR
COVERAGE OF THE 2016 POLITICAL
CAMPAIGN.
DONALD TRUMP WAS AT A RALLY IN
WISCONSIN AND WE WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER
IS AN CAMPAIGN.
JOINING ME FROM WASHINGTON IS AL
HUNT OF "RUMORED VIEW --
"BLOOMBERG VIEW."
IT'S GOOD TO HEAR FROM YOU, AL.
AL: GOOD TO BE WITH YOU,
CHARLES.
CHARLIE: I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO TALK WITH YOU SINCE YOU WERE
IN PENNSYLVANIA.
GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT YOU
FOUND WHEN YOU TALK TO A LOT OF
PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE, A STATE
CRUCIAL TO DONALD TRUMP, AND MY
IMPRESSION IS HILLARY CLINTON IS
UP A BIT.
AL: SHE IS.
PENNSYLVANIA IS REALLY SEVERAL
DIFFERENT DATES, BUT TWO PRIMARY
DIVIDES THERE, THE WEST,
WORKING-CLASS, THERE USED TO BE
SEAL MILLS, COAL MILLS.
USED TO BE HEAVILY DEMOCRATIC.
DONALD TRUMP DOES WELL THERE,
PROBABLY EVEN BETTER THAN IT
ROMNEY DID.
THEN THERE'S THE EAST, BUCKS,
MONTGOMERY, DELAWARE.
THOSE FOUR SUBURBAN COUNTIES
WILL CAST MORE VOTES THAN
PHILADELPHIA AND PITTSBURGH
COMBINED AND TRUMP IS GETTING
CLOBBERED IN THOSE SUBURBS.
THE PLACES HE'S DOING WELL ARE
PLACES THAT ARE NOT GROWING MUCH
AS FAR AS VOTERS OR POPULATION.
THE PLACES HE'S GETTING
CLOBBERED ARE TAKING OFF.
I THINK IT WILL TAKE A MIRACLE
FOR DONALD TRUMP TO EVEN BE
COMPETITIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA
RIGHT NOW.
CHARLIE: IS THIS THE LARGER
PICTURE OF HIM, HE'S DOING WELL
IN PLACES THAT SEEM TO BE LESS
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR FUTURE
AND WORSE WITH THOSE PEOPLE WHO
SEEM MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR
FUTURE?
AL: NO QUESTION.
CERTAINLY IT IS THE SUBURBS AND
EXURBS.
THEY WENT FOR OBAMA, THEY'RE
GOING MORE DECISIVELY FOR
HILLARY CLINTON IN LARGE PART
BECAUSE THEIR ANTI-TRUMP.
