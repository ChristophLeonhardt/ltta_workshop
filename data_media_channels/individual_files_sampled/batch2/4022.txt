a lot of legal questions surrounding the president this morning Joe posted for the Washington Post overnight he's with his kids but he had to chime in here and he characterizes exactly what we're looking at with John Bolton and then Andrew will have you chime in you covered him Trump's third national security adviser in 14 months has called for the pre-emptive bombing of both North Korea and Iran while defending his role in the worst u.s. foreign policy disaster since Vietnam he is thinking about preemptively striking North Korea while we have a president Andrea who has always asked why can't we new people well one of the things that so extraordinary about this is that the president has hired a national security adviser who has talked about North Korea in this way and is not at all clear that this summit should be held and for the first time now I am doubtful because I think the president really wanted this meeting you know man-to-man with Kim jong-un the drama of it but I think with Bolton there there'll be some caution flags now because his vision of North Korea and of these talks is frankly a little more realistic and Willie as the Admiral said earlier the drumbeat of war is now beating a little louder with John Bolton in there yeah Admiral stavridis said that Jeremy bash said the same thing Andrea I was interested to to be reminded as I read through some research last night that there were Republicans from the Bush administration condi rice Bob gates among them who signaled and warned to the new trump administration during the transition not to include John Bolton as part of their administration this is somebody who obviously they worked very close with under george w bush well there are a number of Bush administration former officials I've talked to a number of them since this has all happened who are very concerned about this frankly because John Bolton was basically somebody who would burn the house down he was not he did not play well with his colleagues and so as was famously said at his confirmation hearing where he failed to be confirmed to us to be UN ambassador but served as a recess appointing the problem that they see with John Bolton is that he's so smart he knows how the bureaucracy works you were talking earlier you and mica of course about the role with Jon Meacham of National Security Adviser he is going to be right near the oval office he is run over well he is so smart he knows the inside game he's got you know he's a knife fighter frankly and the the person who would be most isolated by this in addition to Pompeo who agrees with him more ideologically on North Korea and Iran for instance but not on the lack of need for diplomacy the the person most isolated by this I think is Jim mattis I think this is a enormous challenge for the defense secretary who is a good relationship who has had a singular role in this national security team because of the respect the president has for him but now he's really isolated Andrea heyit's Heilmann I want to ask you to just put on your to kind of integrate your your your foreign policy chops and your domestic policy knowledge and and try to explain something for me having watched Donald Trump over the course of the 2016 campaign and the way in which he talked we can we often characterize him as almost an isolationist the notion that he was not selling hawkish nasaan the campaign trail he was he was selling a restraint we can't be the barrier what America can't be the world's policeman and now he seems to be in a year into office more hawkish and more interventionist and so he going to to Bolton to get quote the foreign policy he wants on North Carolina on North Korea and Iran so can you just help me understand what's happened in the evolution of Trump's of view and of his calculation of his own political self-interest I think Iran is key to this because Bolton was one of the toughest from the beginning on Iran and that is an article of faith has always been as you know very well from the campaign North Korea is a little a little different and clearly what you pointed out is that he is now so hawkish he he's still the same person who wants to have diplomacy with Kim jong-un so they're not in the same page they're at least going in I think this has to do with personality nature McMaster never clicked with the present he didn't even know him the president did not know McMaster and it was you know the stars on his on the shoulders that really was so appealing and it was probably a mistake for HR to stay on active duty in that role that's a hard ball to play an active duty it's never done before I think it's also Fox TV it likes the television aspect well yes and that's what really strikes and he's got some television that he wants to compete with and that's 60 minutes this Sunday night thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories
