♪ ♪ Laura: A LOT OF NEWS TONIGHT. WHAT A DIFFERENCE 24 HOURS CAN MAKE. REPORTS TONIGHT THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE SEEN THE LAST OF ROD ROSENSTEIN. THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS APPARENTLY READY TO QUIT YESTERDAY BUT WAS WORRIED ABOUT TRUMP GOING AFTER HIM AND TODAY SOURCES ARE TELLING "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" AND "THE WASHINGTON POST" THAT HE WILL SURVIVE AT LEAST UNTIL AFTER THE MIDTERMS. IF HE IS INDEED A STINK ABOUT MY NEXT GUEST WANTS FRONT OF CONGRESS BEFORE THE WEEK IS OUT. JORDAN YOU KNOW, CONGRESSMAN JIM JORDAN. YOUR REACTION TO THESE REPORTS? WE HAVE ANOTHER PIECE OF NEWS THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT AS WELL. HERE'S WHAT I KNOW. YOU GOT THE GUY WHO IN EFFECT IS RUNNING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHO IN FRONT OF SUBORDINATES IS TALKING ABOUT RECORDING THE COMMANDER IN CHIE CHIEF. THAT IS NEVER SUPPOSED DO WE REALLY WANT THAT TO HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? THE SAME GUY WHO FIRED COMEY, THE SAME GUY WHO HIRED MUELLER, THE SAME GUY WHO SIGNED THE THIRD FISA RENEWAL, THE SAME GUY WHO THREATENED THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE STAFFER IN THE SAME GUY WHO'S MADE IT DIFFICULT TO GET THE DOCUMENTS WE NEED, IS NOW INSIDE MEETING, ACCORDING TO "THE NEW YORK TIMES," THREATENING TO ACTUALLY RECORD Laura: A JOKE. I DON'T CARE. Laura: THEY SAY TO SET UP FOR THE PRESIDENT, FIRE HIM AND IT WILL BE A WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS, YOU NEED TO COME IN FRONT OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND ANSWER THE QUESTIONS, THE AMERICA PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT TOOK PLACE. WHO WAS IN THAT MEETING? ANDY McCABE, LISA PAGE, PETER STRZOK? WHO ELSE WAS THERE? WE NEED TO TALK TO THOSE PEOPLE AS WELL. THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT, AGAIN, WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, WHICH IS WHAT ROD ROSENSTEIN IS IN EFFECT DOING, YOU CAN'T BE MAKING STATEMENTS LIKE THAT, EVEN IF YOU ARE JOKING AROUND. I WANT TO KNOW WHO WAS IN THE ROOM AND WHAT TOOK PLACE. Laura: THERE'S ANOTHER REPORT TONIGHT THAT TREY GOWDY AND BOB GOODLATTE FROM OVERSIGHT JUDICIARY HAVE INVITED GRETA LYNCH, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL, SALLY YATES, FORMER ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND I THINK ONE OF THE PERSON JIM COMEY TO COME BACK TO TESTIFY TO ON CAPITOL HILL. THEY SENT OUT LETTERS. I THINK IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN AN INVITATION. IT WILL TAKE A SUBPOENA. TO BE WHEN THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ROLL UP AND SAY WHAT YOU NEED? I WANT SUSAN RICE BACK. I WANT HER ON CAPITOL HILL. I WANT THE UNMASKING. WE KNOW NEXT WEEK, JIM BAKER, FORMER CHIEF COUNSEL AT THE FBI WAS DEMOTED AND LEFT THE FBI. THE FORMER CHIEF COUNSEL WILL BE IN FOR A DEPOSITION. THAT'S IMPORTANT NEXT WEDNESDAY AND IN A COUPLE WEEKS, AND IN OCTOBER 19TH, WE HAVE NELLIE OHR. Laura: WU, NELLIE. WIFE OF TOP DOSES OFFICIAL BREW ARE. Laura: THE FIRST TIME. THAT IS IMPORTANT AS WELL. IT MAY TAKE SUBPOENAS FOR THEM TO BE THERE SO WE CAN GET THE QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED ANSWERED. Laura: THIS IS WHAT ADAM SCHIFF ON MSNBC SAID LAST NIGHT ABOUT THE G.O.P. BASICALLY YOU, AND THE RULE OF LAW, LET'S WATCH. RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO BE SOUNDING THE ALARM. WE NEED TO BE CALLING OUT THE REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO HAVE BEEN ALL TOO TIMID AND AT TIMES COMPLICIT WITH THE PRESIDENT'S ATTACKS ON THE RULE OF LAW. THE SPEAKER AT THE SENATE LEADER CANNOT POSSIBLY CLAIM ANYMORE IF THEY EVER COULD, THAT THE PROSPECT OF INTERFERING WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IS THEORETICAL. IT'S REAL. Laura: FOCUSING ON THE SPECIAL COUNSEL DEAL. THEY ARE ALL WORRIED ABOUT PROTECTING THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT PROTECTING THE RULE OF LAW BUT THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. RULE OF LAW? ARE LIBERAL TOOK PLACE.

USING AN OPPOSITION PARTY DOCUMENT TO SPY ON THE OTHER PARTY. HE IS TALKING ABOUT WE ARE INFRINGING OR HURTING THE RULE OF LAW? THAT IS WHY WE ARE FOCUSED ON THIS. THE KIND OF THING THAT TOOK PLACE THERE SHOULD NEVER HAVE IT IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE KNOW THAT IT DID. THAT IS WHY WE NEED ROD ROSENSTEIN TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT ALL OF US.
