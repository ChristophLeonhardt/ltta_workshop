marching towards Poland's Parliament signs of defiance thousands of women and men coming together to fight plans to make it harder to have an abortion in Poland where the Norse already some of the most restrictive in the European Union I have two values that's why I'm here it's compassion and respect for women and respect for life actually they limit human rights literally human rights we cannot talk about human rights when we exclude fifty percent of population the current law allows women to have an abortion if there's a risk to their life or their health or their pregnancy is the result of rape or incest and if there's irreversible damage for the fetus the new law would ban all abortions in cases of fetal abnormality it's about being pregnant and knowing that the child that you're carrying is going to die actually and die in pain and that's what the church wants from us and that's what the government wants from us and they have no idea what they are talking about in 2016 an attempt by the government to restrict abortion was dropped after large-scale protests this new bill put forward by a civic group is backed by the Catholic Church and MPs from Poland's ruling party this latest round end considered another example of the battle between hardline conservatives a more liberal elements in Polish society anti-abortion campaigners say a change to the current law would save lives I am deeply shocked that anyone could go out to the streets and promote the right to kill the weak and most harmless people you can imagine so the disabled children in the wombs of home of their mothers UN Human Rights experts are calling on the Polish government to reject the bill campaigners on both sides are vowing to fight on Emma Heywood al-jazeera
