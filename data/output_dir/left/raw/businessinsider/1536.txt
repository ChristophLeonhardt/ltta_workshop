janet yellen I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I supported very strongly</font>

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,859
as chair of the Fed I think she's

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,839
working in a very difficult environment

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,440
she's been open about the fact that the

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,780
limits of monetary policy we need his

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,370
fiscal policy but it's not been

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,980
forthcoming I think she's been the first

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,000
chair almost any central bank to point

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,720
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the Fed does has an</font>

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,640
effect on in equality and inequality of

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,980
opportunity I think fed policies have QE

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,309
has led to more any wealth inequality in

13
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:39,660
the United States when you lower

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,230
interest rates to<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero or near zero it</font>

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,530
hurts people who are retiring who owns

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,050
the equity that could we has gone way up

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,390
in value who owns<font color="#E5E5E5"> that well the people</font>

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,840
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very top so QE wasn't their</font>

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,399
intent has had the effect of increasing

20
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:06,299
inequality the big debate where she is

21
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,510
one member of the board and she is

22
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,060
trying to manage the politics in a very

23
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,020
difficult situation there are inflation

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,150
hawks and on the other end the board is

25
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,840
now I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> least has several people who</font>

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,500
worry about unemployment and she's one

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,970
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those and so overall I think she's</font>

28
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,090
done a good job of keeping obey the

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,040
inflation<font color="#E5E5E5"> hawks there's only been one</font>

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,259
increase in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> interest rate as I look</font>

31
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the American economy the risk of</font>

32

inflation remains very very remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> persistence of unemployment remains</font>

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,439
very real and let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain a little</font>

35
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,759
bit about unemployment because some

36
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,430
people look at the five percent for you

37
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,540
know less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than five percent unemployment</font>

38
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">say isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that really good performance</font>

39
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,758
the answer is the labor market is still

40
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,300
very weak evidence the fact that wages

41
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,170
are

42
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,040
barely keeping up with inflation the low

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,950
labor force participation there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

44
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,750
of disguised and employment if you look

45
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,090
at those who are holding jobs part-time

46
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,950
involuntarily the number of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

47

disability the people who discouraged

48
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,569
workers have stopped searching for a job

49
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:34,860
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gives me the the view is that</font>

50
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,670
that that unbalanced she's been able to

to maintain a difficult politics of
