STEVE: WELCOME BACK TO "THE NEXT

00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:26,726
STEVE: WELCOME BACK TO "THE NEXT

3
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:29,128
REVOLUTION" WE'LL LOOK AT THE

4
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:31,231
OUT GOING GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN.

5
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:37,871
WE'LL LOOK AT THE ECONOMY AND

6
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,204
BUDGET.

7
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:41,040
IS JERRY BROWN KILLING

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,441
CALIFORNIA?

9
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:47,914
YOU CAN JOIN IN AT HOME.

10
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:51,317
NOW, LET'S START WITH

11
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:51,718
IMMIGRATION.

12
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,755
HERE ARE THE FACTS.

13
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,023
>> HI, STEVE.

14
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:00,159
THE DEBATE IS NO QUESTION.

15
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,361
CALIFORNIA IS GROUND ZERO.

16
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,096
THERE ARE 11 MILLION

17
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,631
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN THE

18
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,031
U.S.

19
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:06,833
2 MILLION OF THEM ARE IN

20
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:07,567
CALIFORNIA.

21
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,369
THAT'S 6% OF THE STATES

22
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:09,903
POPULATION.

23
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,805
NEARLY ONE IN TEN CALIFORNIA

24
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:14,841
WORKERS ACCORDING TO RESEARCH IS

25
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:18,111
AN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT.

26
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:21,314
LAST YEAR JERRY BROWN DECLARED

27
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,349
CALIFORNIA IS FIRST SANCTUARY

28
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,651
STATE IN THE NATION.

29
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:27,186
THEY LIMIT FEDERAL AUTHORITIES

30
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:29,722
FROM DEPORTING ACCUSED AND OFTEN

31
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,058
TIME CONVICTED CRIMINALS.

32
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:35,061
IT PROHIBITS SHARING INFORMATION

33
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:37,864
FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ON

34
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:38,631
CRIMES.

35
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:41,034
IT PROTECTS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

36
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:44,370
FROM BEING ASKED ABOUT THEIR

37
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:44,704
STATUS.

38
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,806
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS SUING

39
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:47,941
THE STATE.

40
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,243
21 CITIES AND TWO COUNTIES ARE

41
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,078
ALSO VOICING OPPOSITION TO THE

42
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,014
LAW EITHER WITH FRIEND OF THE

43
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,950
COURT BRIEFS OR INDIVIDUAL

44
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,517
LAWSUITS.

45
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,919
WHAT'S THE COST TO HARBOR SO

46
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:05,625
MANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, A

47
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,626
WOPPING $23 BILLION PER YEAR.

48
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,360
THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE THE FIRST

49
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,496
STATE TO OFFER FULL HEALTH

50
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:13,232
COVERAGE TO UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS.

51
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:18,237
THIS WILL COST TAXPAYERS AN

52
00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:18,905
ADDITIONAL $250 MILLION.

53
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,808
>> THANK YOU.

54
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,176
STEVE: LET'S GET THE DEBATE

55
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:23,776
UNDERWAY TONIGHT.

56
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:29,415
WE HAVE CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL

57
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:33,653
CANDIDATE BRAD SHERMAN AND GRAY

58
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,587
DAVIS.

59
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,489
ANTONIO, LET'S START WITH YOU.

60
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,524
THIS IS ON TOP OF MANY PEOPLES

61
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:39,659
CONCERNS IN THE STATE.

62
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,761
IT FEELS LIKE FOR DEMOCRATS THIS

63
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,596
IS THE HEART OF RESISTANCE.

64
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,932
THEY WOULD LIKE TO EXPLOIT THIS

65
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,700
TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.

66
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,370
>> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

67
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,405
LEGAL IMMIGRATION AND ILLEGAL

68
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:52,805
IMMIGRATION.

69
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,741
I CAME IN HERE 1985.

70
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,677
IF YOU ARE HERE ILLEGALLY THAT'S

71
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,878
AGAINST FEDERAL LAW.

72
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,613
IT'S AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION.

73
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,315
WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO

74
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,852
COME HERE ILLEGALLY AND TAKE

75
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,786
ADVANTAGE OF US.

76
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:10,556
WE PAY TAXES EVERY SINGLE DAY.

77
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:13,760
DEMOCRATS WOULD LIKE TO SELL A

78
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,295
CAR WITH NO ENGINE.

79
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:18,431
THIS WILL STOP IN NOVEMBER.

80
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,466
STEVE: THIS SANCTUARY STATE IS A

81
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,368
REAL SHIFT FROM WHEN HE

82
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,903
PRESENTED HIMSELF AS A

83
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,838
REASONABLE MODERATE DEMOCRAT.

84
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,574
FEELS LIKE HE'S COMPLETELY

85
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:31,377
PANNERRING TO HIS BASE.

86
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,612
>> IT'S DONALD TRUMP PANDERING

87
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,414
TO HIS BASE.

88
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,915
SPLITTING UP FAMILIES THAT HAVE

89
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,351
BEEN HERE FOR 20 OR 30 YEARS.

90
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,986
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP OBAMA DID

91
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:40,987
THAT TOO.

92
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,356
>> WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA PUSHED

93
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:47,226
FOR, WHAT WE NEED IS

94
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:48,995
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION

95
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:49,328
REFORM.

96
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:52,031
WE ARE TRYING TO BRING

97
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,066
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM

98
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:53,966
TO THE FLOOR.

99
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:56,302
IF THAT HAPPENS WE'LL HAVE A

100
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,304
SETTLEMENT TO ALL OF THIS.

101
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,473
INSTEAD WE SAY IMMIGRANTS ARE

102
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:03,476
RAPIST AND MURDERERS AND THAT

103
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,412
KIND OF -- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

104
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,246
HE SAID.

105
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:09,749
STEVE: ONE AT A TIME.

106
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,786
HOW CAN ANY REASONABLE PERSON --

107
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,388
LET'S ASK THE QUESTION THIS WAY.

108
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,223
I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT ABOUT

109
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,559
NOT USING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

110
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:25,031
SYSTEM TO PENALIZE RESPONSIBLE

111
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:25,364
PEOPLE.

112
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:27,467
THE PRIORITY SHOULD BE

113
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:27,834
CRIMINALS.

114
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:33,372
THERE IS NO PRY OR

115
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:33,406
THERE IS NO PRI OR

116
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:33,439
THERE IS NO PRIORR

117
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,340
THERE IS NO PRIORITY FOR

118
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,141
DEMOCRATS.

119
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,175
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

120
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:40,780
FIRST OF ALL WE DEPORT THOSE AND

121
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:45,685
HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF CEREAL

122
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,220
CRIME -- SERIOUS CRIMES.

123
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,122
IT'S REPUBLICANS THAT REFUSE TO

124
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,858
ALLOW US TO DEBATE IT ON THE

125
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:52,158
FLOOR.

126
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:55,194
WHEN THEY SIGNED THE DISCHARGE

127
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,829
PETITION AND RISE UP AGAINST

128
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,931
THEIR OWN LEADERSHIP WE'LL SOLVE

129
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,367
THE PROBLEM.

130
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,602
>> AGAIN, I'M HAPPY YOU BROUGHT

131
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:06,672
UP THE ISSUE OF COME

132
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:07,006
UP THE ISSUE OF COMPASSION.

133
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,375
AT WHAT POINT DO WE HAVE

134
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,245
COMPASSION FOR EVERYDAY LEGAL

135
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:16,149
AMERICANS THAT BUST THERE BUT.

136
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,684
PRIORITY IS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

137
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:20,520
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT TO

138
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,354
PEOPLE LIKE ME.

139
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,157
STEVE: I WOULD LIKE TO GET

140
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,959
GOVERNOR DAVIS IN ON THIS ONE.

141
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,728
>> FIRST, LET'S TAKE A STEP

142
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,028
BACK.

143
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,565
LOOK WHAT IMMIGRANTS DID IN 2017

144
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:36,469
ACCORDING TO THE FORTUNE 500

145
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,037
ALMOST 50% OF THE BUSINESSES

146
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,072
WERE STARTED BY IMMIGRANTS OR

147
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:41,374
CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS.

148
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:45,311
LOOK AT THE TOP 35, 57% WERE

149
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,147
STARTED BY IMMIGRANTS.

150
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,883
STEVE: I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS

151
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:51,984
CHALLENGING THAT.

152
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,920
NONE OF THE PEOPLE ARE

153
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,021
CHALLENGING THAT.

154
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,656
>> WE NEED TO LOOK AT BOTH SIDES

155
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,757
OF THE LEDGER.

156
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:01,093
STEVE: WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT'S

157
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:05,364
INVOLVED IN THE BIDDING FOR LAW

158
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,799
ENFORCEMENT STOPPING PEOPLE FROM

159
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:10,069
BEING HERE ILLEGALLY.

160
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,239
>> JERRY BROWN INSISTED THAT 800

161
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,575
CRIMES BE WRITTEN INTO THE NEW

162
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:20,847
LAW SO THEY MUST COMPLY WITH

163
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,481
SOME REQUESTS.

164
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:23,883
800 CRIMES.

165
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,018
THIS IS A FAIR COMPROMISE.

166
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,020
REMEMBER, THE STATE HAS ONE

167
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,421
OBLIGATION.

168
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,156
TO REDUCE CRIME.

169
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,592
TO GET CRIME SOLVED YOU NEED HIM

170
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,594
GRANTS TELLING YOU WHO DID IT.

171
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,129
IF THEY DON'T PARTICIPATE CRIME

172
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,698
DOESN'T GO DOWN.

173
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,866
REPORTER: DO YOU SEE THE POLICY

174
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,768
AS A CRIME REDUCTION PROGRAM.

175
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:45,137
>> THEY CALL THEMSELVES

176
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:46,472
DEMOCRATS BUT THEY ARE

177
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:46,839
SOCIALIST.

178
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,508
THEY RUN THE STATE INTO THE

179
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:51,844
GROUND FOR 30 YEARS.

180
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,613
STEVE: STICK WITH IMMIGRATION.

181
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,881
>> HOW COME ICE CAN'T COME IN

182
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,916
AND TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS IN OUR

183
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,216
STATE.

184
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,218
THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED.

185
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,753
WE ARE A SANCTUARY STATE.

186
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,688
WE HAVE TO BE A SANCTUARY

187
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:03,990
COUNTRY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

188
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,826
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRANTS.

189
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,861
AMERICANS PAY TAXES.

190
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:12,498
AMERICANS WANT TO GO BACK TO

191
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:12,798
WORK.

192
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:14,634
STEVE: CONGRESSMAN, I HEAR YOUR

193
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,535
POINT ABOUT THE NEED FOR REFORM.

194
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:19,272
MY QUESTION IS IN THE ABSENCE OF

195
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,274
THAT YOU CAN'T JUST THROW

196
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,808
EVERYTHING OUT AND SAY WELL,

197
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:25,378
LET'S MAKE A POINT AGAINST

198
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,846
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THUMB ALL

199
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,582
OVER HIM AND PUT COMMUNITIES IN

200
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,449
DANGER.

201
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,618
>> YOU PROVIDE FOR THE

202
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,587
DEPORTATION OF THOSE CONVICTED

203
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,888
OF 800 DIFFERENT CRIMES.

204
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,690
YOU ARE NOT PUTTING COMMUNITIES

205
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,026
AT RISK.

206
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:45,164
STEVE: WHAT HAPPENED AT OAKLAND.

207
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:48,100
>> SHE MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO

208
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,835
FAMILIES WHO HADN'T BEEN

209
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:51,404
CONVICTED OF ANYTHING.

210
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,406
THEY WERE BREAKING APART

211
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:53,773
FAMILIES.

212
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,609
SHE SAID NO TO THAT.

213
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,345
ONCE WE GET COMPREHENSIVE

214
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:02,481
IMMIGRATION REFORM THEN

215
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:04,717
CALIFORNIA WILL COOPERATE WITH

216
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:05,051
THAT.

217
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,719
STEVE: PEOPLE ARE UPSET ABOUT

218
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,120
WHAT'S GOING ON.

219
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,189
>> I HEAR COMPREHENSIVE

220
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,991
IMMIGRATION REFORM FROM

221
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,225
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.

222
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,027
WE CAN AGREE WE NEED IT.

223
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:18,497
WITH REPUBLICANS AT LEAST TRUMP

224
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:20,800
SUPPORTERS MOST BELIEVE THAT IS

225
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,836
WITH BORDER ENFORCEMENT.

226
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,671
WE DON'T WANT MECHANISMS THAT

227
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:25,972
WORK.

228
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:30,242
WE WANT TO PROTECT DACA,

229
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:32,578
DREAMERS, AND FAMILIES.

230
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,613
STEVE: I JUST WANT TO ASK A

231
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:35,214
SPECIFIC QUESTION.

232
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,049
WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

233
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,352
THIS IS THE BIG QUESTION

234
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,187
EVERYONE IS CONCERNED ABOUT.

235
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,889
IT'S NOT ABOUT LEGAL

236
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:44,490
IMMIGRATION.

237
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,025
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, ARE YOU

238
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:50,363
HAPPY WITH THE LEVEL OF ILLEGAL

239
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,964
IMMIGRATION IN CALIFORNIA TODAY.

240
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,833
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SEE NONE OF

241
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:54,133
IT.

242
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,835
LET ME SHOW YOU THE PROGRESS

243
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,970
THAT'S BEEN MADE.

244
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,406
STEVE: HOW CAN YOU SUPPORT

245
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,974
BROWN?

246
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,042
>> 2.4 MILLION PEOPLE CROSSED

247
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,744
THE BORDER ILLEGAL.

248
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,480
THE LAST TEN YEARS 750,000.

249
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,415
THIS PROBLEM IS GOING DOWN.

250
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,617
PLUS, MOST OF THOSE IMMIGRANTS

251
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,753
IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE

252
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,588
BEEN FROM SOUTHEAST ASIAN NOT

253
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,490
MEXICO.

254
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,825
STEVE: THE COSTS ARE GOING UP.

255
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:22,061
HANG ON A SECOND, DO YOU KNOW

256
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,297
WHAT THE BIGGEST EXPENDITURE IS

257
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:31,637
IN CALIFORNIA IMMIGRATION.

258
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,071
>> EDUCATION.

259
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,572
STEVE: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

260
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:33,939
SPENDING.

261
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:35,141
OF THE BUDGET.

262
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,443
JUST TO TAKE ONE EXAMPLE ABOUT

263
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,179
HOW MUCH THIS EFFECTS EVERY

264
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,048
TAXPAYER IN CALIFORNIA.

265
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,517
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IS WITH

266
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,053
BIRTHINGS IN HOSPITALS THAT'S

267
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,121
DEVOTED TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

268
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,689
>> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO

269
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:51,223
THAT.

270
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,725

00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,161
STEVE: I'M ASKING YOU TO TAKE A

272

DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF THE

278
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,740
STATE'S HEALTH BUDGET IS SPENT

279
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,009
ON BIRTHS FOR THE CHILDREN OF

280
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,446
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS?

281
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,714
>> WHAT I DO KNOW THEY

282
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:16,115
INCREASE --

283
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,550
STEVE: DO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO

ANSWER.

292
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,867
IT'S A THIRD.

293
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,903
IT'S 30% OF THE BUDGET OF

294
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,605
