CREATE PRETEXT TO INVESTIGATE IT. IF TOMORROW'S HEARING WILL DRILL DOWN ON THAT VERY CENTRAL QUESTION HERE AND EARLIER THIS EVENING I SPOKE WITH LINDSEY GRAHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA, A MEMBER OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. TONIGHT A LETTER THAT YOU WROTE TO ROD ROSENSTEIN WHO IS VERY CENTRAL TO ALL OF THIS AND IN IT WE ARE GOING TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN THE TWO QUESTIONS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE HIM TO ANSWER. SUPERVISING THE INFORMANT OR DIRECTING THE DECISION TO USE THE INFORMANT? DID STRZOK OR PAGE OF ANY SUCH ROLE TO ANY INFORMANT USE TO INVESTIGATE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN OR ASSOCIATES AND NUMBER TWO DID STRZOK OR PAGE HAVE ANY ROLE IN REVIEWING, APPROVING OR SUPPLYING INFORMATION FOR THE FISA WARRANT OBTAINED TWO SURVEILLED CARTER PAGE. HE PUT THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER, YOUR LETTER AND THAT REAL CLEAR INVESTIGATIONS PIECE, EVERYBODY IS PROBING AT HOW THIS WHOLE THING GOT STARTED AND WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS SOME FORM OF ENTRAPMENT. WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS THE PERSON IN CHARGE OF THE CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION, MR. STRZOK AND MS. PAGE OR IN THE TANK FOR CLINTON AND HATED TRUMP. DID THOSE TWO PEOPLE START AN INVESTIGATION AGAINST THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THEY HAD A POLITICAL BIAS? OR WAS IT BASED ON LEGITIMATE EVIDENCE? HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THIS GUY SUPERVISING A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT AGAINST THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN GIVEN HIS BIAS AND GIVEN HIS DISLIKE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP? HE SHOULD BE THE LAST GUY TO GO TO COURT TO GET A WARRANT ON ANYBODY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. MY QUESTION IS WHAT ROLE DID Martha: IT FOLLOWS UP ON THEIR TEXT MESSAGES, WHICH I FUNNY, I WAS JUST KIDDING AROUND. I DIDN'T LIKE THE PRESIDENT BUT IT HAD NO BEARING WHATSOEVER ON MY ACTIONS. BUT TALKING ABOUT THE INSURANCE POLICY, TALK ABOUT STOPPING HIM. AND THEN, LATE SPRING OF 2016, ALL THESE EFFORTS TO TRY TO POKE FOR SOFT PLACES WITHIN THE JULY 31ST THEY CLEAR CLINTON. LET ME TELL YOU THIS, IF YOU HAD DONE WHAT SHE HAD DONE WITH HER EMAIL SYSTEMS AND COMPROMISED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CLEARED, SO THEY COULD NOT STOP TRUMP IF THEY FOUND HER GUILTY OF ABUSING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. SO THERE WAS NO WAY IN HELL IF THE GOAL WAS TO FIND CLINTON LIABLE. THE QUESTION NOW IS ABOUT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. IT WAS IT A COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION WHERE THEY WERE IF THAT'S THE REASON THEY INVESTIGATED THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THERE ARE SOME THE FACT THAT THEY NEVER TOLD THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION IS VERY CURIOUS TO ME. Martha: I AGREE. THAT WOULD BE A DEFENSIVE BRIEFING AND THERE'S A VERY CLEAR MENTION OF THE DECISION NOT TO DO A DEFENSIVE BRIEFING AND HOPEFULLY WE ARE GOING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS WITH SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS. JOHN BRENNAN, NO FAN OF THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THIS. WHEN THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S WORK IS DONE, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MUST HAVE ITS MODERN-DAY EQUIVALENT OF WATERGATE HEROES. HOWARD BAKER, ELLIOTT RICHARDSON, JOHN B, WHO WILL PUT COUNTRY, FELLOW CITIZENS AND LAW ABOVE ANY ONE PERSON INCLUDING DONALD TRUMP. RECEIVE COUNSEL AND ADVICE FROM ABOUT ANYTHING RELATED TO TRUMP WOULD BE BRENNAN. I THINK VERNON HAS SHOWN A DISLIKE FOR THE PRESIDENT THAT QUESTIONS WHETHER OR NOT HE ACTUALLY WAS FAIR AS THE CIA DIRECTOR. YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT THE PEOPLE WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE HATED TRUMP AND I THINK THEY WERE ALL IN THE TANK FOR CLINTON AND WE WILL SEE WHAT MR. MUELLER SAYS, BUT I DO KNOW THIS. CONNECTION EARLY ON WAS MR. STRZOK, WHO WAS CLEARLY IN THE TANK FOR CLINTON AND HATED TRUMP. I UNDERSTAND WHY MUELLER FIRED HIM. I UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULD FIRE OTHER PEOPLE GIVEN THEIR BEHAVIOR REGARDING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. SO WE WILL SEE WHAT MR. MUELLER DOES BUT I'M SHOCKED THAT NOBODY IN YOUR BUSINESS REALLY OUTSIDE OF FOX NEWS SEEMS TO GIVE A DAMN THAT THE HEAD INVESTIGATOR FOR THE FBI WANTED TO STOP TRUMP AND BASICALLY FASTER DICED AN Martha: IF THERE WAS ANY ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN ON THE PART OF THESE INDIVIDUALS, EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE VERY, VERY
