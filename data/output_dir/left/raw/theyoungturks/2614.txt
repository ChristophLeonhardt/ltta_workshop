1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,480
WE HEARD A LOT OF

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,009
PROPAGANDA ABOUT THE TAX CUTS
THAT DONALD TRUMP PUSH THROUGH

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:10,070
WILL LEAD TO BONUSES ON TOP OF
BONUSES FOR AMERICAN WORKERS.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:17,170
AT&T AND WALMART AND BANK OF
AMERICA, THEY ARE ALL GIVING

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,540
BONUSES.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:26,940
I LIKE THAT REUTERS FOLLOWED UP
ON THE STORY AND DID A POLL TO

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,660
SEE IF IT FOUND OUT THAT IF IT

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,159
AFFECTED A LARGE AMOUNT OF
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,649
IT HAS GONE A TON OF PRESS AND
TRUMP HAS DONE A LOT OF CREDIT

10
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:41,390
FOR IT.

11
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,930
YOU CAN'T FAKE IT IF PEOPLE HAVE
A POSITIVE OUTCOME IN THEIR

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,930
LIFE.

13
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,059
THAT MY MAKE THEM MORE LIKELY
TO VOTE FOR HIM.

14
00:00:50,059 --> 00:01:07,620
EVEN IF IT IS A SUGAR HIGH,
LET'S FIND OUT.

15
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:14,330
A WHOPPING 2%.

16
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:20,980
NOT FOR 90% OF YOU THE BONUSES
ARE NOT COMING.

17
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:28,290
IS IT POPULAR OVERALL?

18
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,440
ANOTHER
STORY IN THE NEWS TODAY, TRUMP

19
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,770
IS APPARENTLY JUBILANT.

20
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,680
HE
THINKS HE HAS CRUSHED

21
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,510
EVERYTHING.

22
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,300
WE KNOW WHAT HIS POPULARITY IS,
IT IS IN THE 30S AND LITERALLY

23
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,680
THE WORST OF ANY PRESIDENT AT
THIS POINT IN THEIR FIRST TERM.

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,810
BUT TRUMP LIVES ON A DIFFERENT
PLANET AND SO DO HIS SUPPORTERS.

25
00:01:50,810 --> 00:02:07,890
SO WHERE ARE WE?

26
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,060
THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY ARE EXACTLY RIGHT.

27
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,579
IT DIDN'T WORK.

28
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:16,709
IN THE OLD DAYS YOU JUST PUT IT
ON TV AND BRAINWASH PEOPLE.

29
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:20,561
NOWADAYS YOU HAVE THIS THING
CALLED A COMPUTER, A PHONE,

30
00:02:20,561 --> 00:02:23,680
AND YOU CAN GET NEWS ON
THE INTERNET.

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,939
IF YOU LOOK AROUND A LITTLE BIT
YOU WILL ACTUALLY FIND THE

32
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,480
TRUTH.

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,790
IN THE YEAR 2027, THE TOP 1%
OF THIS COUNTRY WILL GET 83%

34
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,040
OF THE BENEFITS OF THE TAX PLAN.

35
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,819
AND YOU CAN SEE IT WITH YOUR OWN
EYES, THEY CUT CORPORATE TAXES

36
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:42,980
FOR MANY.

37
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,159
IT'S A MASSIVE TRANSFER OF
WEALTH TO MULTINATIONAL

38
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,170
CORPORATIONS

39
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,340
AND THE VERY WEALTHY.

40
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,970
NO MATTER
HOW MUCH PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON

41
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,219
AND NEW YORK ARE ECSTATIC ABOUT

42
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:01,499
THEIR STOCK AND HOW THE MARKET
IS DOING BECAUSE THEY ARE RICH

43
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:05,480
AND GETTING RICHER BY THE DAY,
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS NOT

44
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,340
FEELING IT AND YOU HAVE NOT
CHECKED TO THEM.

45
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,840
AT SOME POINT REALITY HAS A WAY
OF CATCHING UP WITH YOU AND WE

46
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,499
WILL FIND OUT IF THAT IS 2018.

47
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:16,909
RIGHT NOW THE NUMBERS ARE WAY
WORSE FOR REPUBLICANS THAN I

48
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:28,760
THINK THEY REALIZE OR ANYONE
ON 

49
00:03:28,760 --> 00:00:00,000
TV REALIZES.
