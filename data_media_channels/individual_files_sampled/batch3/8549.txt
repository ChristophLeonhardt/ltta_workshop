PLACE. SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT HERE, TOO IN SEOUL WITH SO MUCH INVESTED IS HOPING SOMETHING CAN BE BROUGHT TOGETHER AS WELL. IS THERE ANYTHING MORE THAT WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THAT NUCLEAR TEST SITE THAT WAS SAID TO BE DISMANTLED YESTERDAY? ANY VERIFICATION OF WHAT TOOK PLACE? EXACTLY. THAT MAJOR EVENT ON THURSDAY WAS PRETTY MUCH LEFT IN THE DUST BY THE OTHER NEWS EVENT ON THURSDAY. WE'RE GETTING NEW IMAGERY FROM OUR SISTER NETWORK IN THE U.K. SKY NEWS. THEY WERE ONE OF THE FEW FOREIGN MEDIA THAT WERE ALLOWED TO GO ALONG AND WE SEE THE MASSIVE PORTALS AND TUNNELS IN THAT NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. THAT SITE BEING BLOWN UP. STRONG EXPLOSIONS. THE HITCH AS WE HAVE BEEN SAYING AND SKY NEWS WAS SAYING, THERE WERE NO INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS OR ANALYSTS OR EXPERTS AROUND. REPORTERS EXAMINED THE AFTERMATH BUT THEY COULDN'T TELL EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING. NO WAY TO CONFIRM THE CLAIMS OF NORTH KOREA. BY THE WAY, BILL, MAYBE THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THOSE REPORTERS FOR US IF WE HAD GONE ALONG IS A 12-HOUR TRAIN RIDE. ANOTHER TWO HOURS BY BUS. THE WHOLE TRAVEL THERE AND BACK FROM A COASTAL CITY WITH THE BLINDS DOWN, NO FILMING. NO VIEWS OF THIS HERMIT KINGDOM THAT WE MOSTLY GET TO SEE INSIDE OF PYONGYANG. REMEMBER, THE TIMING OF ALL THIS A COUPLE HOURS AFTER THAT
