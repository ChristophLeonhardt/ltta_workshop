all right all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right I think</font>

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,260
crying is incredibly tiring aside from

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,450
the cucumber's needed for my puffy eyes

6
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,790
in the morning the eyelash curler and

mascara assisting my disguise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel</font>

the chaos<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a kid drawing zigzagged</font>

the black crayon inside of me has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

secret coves of our hopefully

17

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,530
or else the police will be called by the

21
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,090
neighbors who can hear from next door

22
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,580
and if you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> male there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

not sin this is frustrating I know I

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,939
hope GP mental health care plan funded

for Mighty Ducks reflect this immense

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,640
require the solution of fresh cucumber

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,790
slices to hide or the awful words that
