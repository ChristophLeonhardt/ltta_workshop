1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
I think in the summer we experience life

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,519
differently and we approach life

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,130
differently and I think probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,480
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> different elements that go into that</font>

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,340
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes if we're smart we can</font>

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,049
actually bridge that into our long-term

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:24,689
relationships I think in the summer we

8
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:26,189
have time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> slow down time to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breathe</font>

9
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,529
time to sit out in the Sun sit on that

10
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,689
little chair with our like ice-t just

11
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,000
kind of allowing ourselves to let

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,710
somebody else in I think of the summer

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,290
we tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be much more playful like I</font>

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,760
think that because the days are longer

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,250
and because we go outside we are willing

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">to sort of try be playful and I think</font>

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,700
that might translate into our sex life

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,039
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well this idea that oh let's see we</font>

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,840
never had sex<font color="#E5E5E5"> under the boardwalk maybe</font>

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,690
we should try<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this time or yeah I</font>

21
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care that our yard has you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 70</font>

22
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,469
apartment buildings around it and we can

23
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:56,850
see and maybe we can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sneak off</font>

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,590
into a corner I think there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a plate</font>

25
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,910
the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> element that really does</font>

26
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,859
translate into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your sex life in</font>

27
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">addition to sort of having time and</font>

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,220
space for people and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just being playful</font>

29
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,820
I think the nakedness<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece summer is</font>

30
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,830
incredibly effective in terms of us

31
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,390
creating relationships i think you know

32
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,159
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take off that code and you take off</font>

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,320
the long pants and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're also you're</font>

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,450
wearing like a bathing<font color="#E5E5E5"> suit or a t-shirt</font>

35
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,729
and you have the sense of your body and

36
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,650
your skin and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just in terms of</font>

37
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,420
other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we do notice other</font>

38
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,549
people's bodies and skins but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we</font>

39
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,170
also start understanding our cells look

40
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,549
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more conscious of our</font>

41
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,320
own bodies<font color="#CCCCCC"> and our own breathing in our</font>

42
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,570
own how nice that Sun feels on your back

43
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">or your thigh or how how amazing to have</font>

44
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,280
that person put their hand on your

45
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,960
shoulder and feel what that feels like

46
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,450
the skin<font color="#CCCCCC"> on skin contact and so I think</font>

47
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,159
having less clothes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general I think</font>

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,600
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nudist would be great for</font>

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,759
everybody but I think general having

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">less clothes really does make you kind</font>

51
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,540
of more aware of your body and the

52
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">embody the person next to you and I</font>

53
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's incredibly powerful in</font>

54
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,869
terms of both your sex life your romance

55
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:58,480
but

56
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,640
an intimacy there and a sort of

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,280
aliveness that you don't get necessarily

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,630
when you're wearing four layers of

59
00:02:04,630 --> 00:00:00,000
clothing and a parka
