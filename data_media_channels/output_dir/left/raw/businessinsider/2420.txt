1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,610
we have the newspaper industry right now

2
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,130
which one would have thought would have

3
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,110
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good opportunity online they have</font>

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,420
the competency of news and and so forth

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,099
and yet the entire industry is just

6
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:25,650
getting shelled and<font color="#CCCCCC"> has experimented on</font>

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,869
line but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not saving them why is it</font>

8
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">that incumbent industries and companies</font>

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,790
have such a hard time doing what you and

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,960
what a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of other entrepreneurs have</font>

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,730
been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do well luckily they do</font>

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,260
have a trouble trouble doing it because

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> creates opportunities for the rest</font>

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,640
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us but yeah I'm always amazed at that</font>

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,350
because on the outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just seems so</font>

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,140
obvious that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you were Time Warner you</font>

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,610
should have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done startups in the</font>

18
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,140
internet space and fun of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font>

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,390
ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they didn't so it's a series of</font>

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,460
things one is they are always<font color="#E5E5E5"> worried</font>

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">about protecting their current business</font>

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,600
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that often gets in the way that</font>

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,400
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the time secondly they have</font>

24
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,250
trouble hiring the right people they

25
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,049
don't they can't create<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole new pay</font>

26
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,040
structure<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you're going to pay</font>

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,299
people much less and give them more

28
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,850
upside so if Time Warner approached me

29
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,440
and said Kevin why don't you start a

30
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,330
business with in Time Warner I would

31
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,500
never even consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there's not</font>

32
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,780
enough upside and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the really good</font>

33
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,790
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't going to go do that and so</font>

34
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,630
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be hard to be successful</font>

35
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,100
there so they have trouble getting the

36
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,480
talent they have trouble managing it

37
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,130
they have trouble moving fast enough and

38
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,440
taking chances and so the combination of

39
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,820
all those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things means that they they</font>

40
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,680
don't do it if they do what they do it

41
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">really poorly I think one of those</font>

42
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,170
interesting things for me is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

43
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,300
looked once at the top 50 websites

44
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,870
online and none of them were new

45
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,450
startups that occurred in a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> media</font>

46
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,330
company out of the top 50 and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still</font>

47
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,070
true today because certainly in the news

48
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,990
business there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> CNN has very big web</font>

49
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,450
presence Bloomberg as it went so a lot

50
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,100
of the traditional media providers but

51
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,600
what I meant there is that date there

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,280
are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple examples that are owned by</font>

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,100
big media companies CNN ESPN are good

54
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,450
examples that where they took their

55
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,190
existing brand and put it online so at

56
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,049
least they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that no one</font>

57
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,150
was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create anything new online</font>

58
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,340
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> where they didn't have the existing</font>

59
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,960
brand name which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we all have to</font>

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,818
do when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do a start-up and so they've</font>

61
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,318
abdicated that entire space and they'll

62
00:02:10,318 --> 00:00:00,000
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>
