I am from UK and I'm Malika Bilal Philippines presidents Rodrigo Duterte says he believes in the competence and capability of women just not in all aspects of life we look at how Filipino women are influencing society and whether present eternities behavior is sexist or simply taken out of context you are now live in the stream and on al Jazeera YouTube so leave your comments in the chat hi I'm Christine Hong I'm a professor at UC Santa Cruz you're in the stream president rodrigo duterte strongman governing style and crude sense of humor has often drawn fire from human rights advocates and feminists but on Sunday who drew fresh criticism when he asked a married woman to kiss him on the lips during a rally in Seoul South Korea the woman says there was no malice in the act and presidential spokesman Harry rock contains it was a playful act in line with Filipino culture which some Filipinos might agree with for me that was okay as long as the woman was okay with it it seems like she was the one who even requested it people are just putting malice to it but it was just a simple kiss the Turkish critics saw the move is yet another example of what they say is his rampant misogyny the president's cavalier commentary on sexual assault and recent announcement that the Philippines next Ombudsman would certainly not be a woman has his detractors saying enough is enough online many Filipino women had begun using the hashtag papaya ko or I am a woman to highlight what they call de ter tase macho fascism take a listen to what the secretary-general of women's group Gabriela said about the kiss you don't have to kiss that woman if you want to entertain entertain people and the fact that you thought that kissing the woman would entertain people says something about how you view women women are for entertainment that you can express or exercise your authority over another person especially a woman is entertainment that's something really is sick president de Zarate on Tuesday said he would resign from office if all offended women signed a petition demanding it he now to help us unpack the controversy in diaspora Verona is a journalist and also one of the organizers of the hashtag papaya ko campaign she joins us from Manila also in Malaysia hello we also have Manila Antonia Contreras he's a professor of political science delassalle University adding Canberra hello there Antonio and in Canberra Australia and Nicole Kyoto is a zoologists as well as a senior research fellow at the University of Canberra hello there Nicole hello everybody good to have you here good morning good morning to you locally where you are and hello to everybody else who's watching okay let me show you something on my laptop Antoni one of the things that you study is everyday politics when we look at this situation here with the president of the Philippines kissing something he brought up from the audience what what does that tell you about everyday politics in the Philippines well when people say that misogyny is already normalized then I would agree with that to some extent because for me it's a structured reality many people blame the president for being an agent of misogyny but I see differently I see him as an output of that an outcome of that and so as other men he's not the only man who's doing that it doesn't make it right but at the same time in order to fight misogyny you have to look it more structurally that it is a product of a world view it is a product of the way people think and it's not just men who are complicitous to that it's also the women who sort of allow a the women who taught them to be like that and maybe in this situation the women who allow themselves to be kissed so hey come on the way everybody raised grew up in a misogynist culture yeah he is a president but if you're going to see you in on the president you're missing the point the point is in order to fight misogyny you don't pull it you don't put it into partisan lenses you see the moment I'm more strategic here if we're going to fight because we are on the same page we don't want misogyny we just defer and and and argue about how to deal with it the way some people yeah yeah what's the second word Antonio you said was misogyny almost as if there was no debate that the president of the Philippines is a misogynist and he's sexist I'm just want to check I mean you see all of the guess here does anyone contend that he's not sexist any debate how people you think that he there are people who think yeah don't agree that he's not I'm saying that he is and so our limit right okay so our other men who are probably not demons you know the way I see it is that when you demonize in so Jeanine you're also demonizing fathers and husband but he's a misogynist Malika yeah so I wanna go I hear we are coming from Antonio but I want to bring in a couple of comments from Twitter this is Jeff he says our government is led by a president who displays behavior in public that is disrespectful of women his mouthpieces spin this by saying it's part of our culture even if it isn't children see this on TV and the dignity of women in this country is being damaged by this administration and in time before I pass this over to you I wanted to read one more this is John who says I'm in the Philippines and I don't agree with the president's spokesman who said this is part of our culture it is never a light moment or acceptable for a sitting president to just kiss someone else's wife or anyone for that matter on the lips for mere entertainment elected officials should always act responsibly and I am wondering your thoughts on this okay the president's top aide Bongo claimed that you know he's a family she loves women and his past very progressive laws in his hometown Davao City but he has been violating the same law which states very clearly that he do not abuse women verbally and that to treat women with respect and this is a president who has continuously abused the mean insulted women and whenever somebody gets his goat up his first reaction is just to heap abuse and not just an abuse but abuse that actually centers on women because let me bring you into the conversation here let me show you something no first of all Nicole some recent compilations 30 examples of the tert a sexist remarks in solidarity were bred by iock oh here's a compilation of prisoner today sexist remarks the tert a.m. portrayal of women in ten of his speeches at one more here from fragrant Filipinos - shooting vaginas the today's top six sexist remarks what impact does this have on the environment between men and women in the Philippines if anything at all when the president is obviously viewing women in a certain kind of way I think one of the curiosities here is at least for some observers is that considering how offensive the statements have been there has been no massive outreach against the president's on the level of people coming out in the street similar to what happened in the United States and I think one explanation for that is because what the president is doing is it's familiar it's not necessarily acceptable but it's familiar what he's doing is characteristic of the sketch comedy I watched growing up in the 80s its characteristic of the noontime show in the Philippines that we see until today it's something that people know is slightly unacceptable but it's also something that a lot of the data supporters weigh against the president's other characteristics I think this is what I observed when I studied the director supporters over the past two years one of the things I always hear from my respondents whether these are in slum communities in Manila or disaster affected communities and central Philippines is that people understand that this is a flawed president this is an imperfect person and yet this person is not one-dimensional this is the same person who brought home distressed Filipino workers from the Middle East this is the same person who is on the scene when a disaster happens this is not to say that his sexism is acceptable but what I'm arguing here is that based on my observations people weigh the kinds of values the characteristics that the president presents and I think that's an important insight because there's a tendency to portray the president's supporters as unthinking as duped by this charismatic leader but that's not necessarily the case I think there's a lot of them there's a lot of scope for debating the values and that people have and I guess the headline is looks familiar but not necessarily acceptable I'm glad that you raised that because I wanted to bring in one another and I want to bring in one of his supporters here on Twitter this is Lynn she says men mayor Duterte was the main driving force for why the city's gender code came into fruition which other provinces patterned their own codes and we're our own country's ginger code was patterned after he got important things done for women than those so-called decent politicians have in died what do you make of what she's saying what she's saying is exactly what I was saying that there might have there might be a progressive code in Davao City but this is a chief executive who thinks he's above that code and about that law and while maybe some of them might be weighing his decisiveness Vav what he what he tree how he treats women like the truth is that a lot of the Turkish reporters have come out and saying we can't have that either because like if this is the way he creates our mothers our wives sisters like children you know that's just not unacceptable and it also actually keeps a toxic atmosphere between men and women and while those noontime shows are indeed familiar I think enough women have also been speaking out against the kind of verbal violence that they do spread the notions and his personality should be more responsible I'm just a very quick comment that yes of course van mayor Duterte was responsible for the east ordinances that protect women but let's not forget that this is a product of civil society groups who are lobbied by women themselves and I think it's just not fair to say that it's the president the only person that instituted these laws in dawa it's a product of long struggle of women's movements in the city that made these anti sexual harassment laws amendable possible and I think that's the case nationally now with President Duterte every time he makes policies or endorses policies that are pure women it's not the president single-handedly steering the country to a direction that benefits some women we have to give credit to women's movements who have always been pushing for these policies yes I just like to follow up don't know what Nicole said earlier about the complexity and the luhan's this the other problem is that if misogyny which is a complex problem its roots are complex its implications or complex manifestations are complex if if we simplify simplify this is a question of good and bad question a black and white then and it becomes partisan then my worry is that people would really go back to their partisan cage caves and and and and grounds and comfort zones the point is it's it's correct the president is misogynist now the problem is how do you see that is that because it's the Philippines misogynist because the president is misogynist as some people would like to say that misogyny is now be grieving and ugly head because the president is a misogynist or it is precisely because you really have a structured misogyny in our society that the president and the Speaker of the House and the Senate President tend to be misogynist that is maybe the finish let me finish and I the point is if you're going to put that in practice and lenses instead of convincing people to your side then it becomes a partisan war and therefore you miss the point of a learning teaching it becomes a teaching learning moment then you miss that because people will tend to go back to their partisan biases that's what I fear because Nicole precisely described this is the situation we the people see that as problematic but it's familiar no not the way I see is giving him a pass but he shouldn't be given a free pass because then Darren loss because it's okay so Antonio and and I I hear where you're coming from on the one hand and I you say the public is letting him get away with this and on the other hand Antonio you mentioned something that I had to write down here structural misogyny we all realize it's there in your words I want to play on that with this video comment that we got from Rueben James who pitched the idea for today's show that we're doing and he talks about the impact of that structural misogyny have a listen president pretty good at that dismissal mystic remarks and women have translated into more brutal violent and distasteful attacks against them during his administration his speech says he always mentions about the binary distinction of what's biologically male what's biological female and with this kind of distinction it sets a social construction of what's the function of women in society and this kind of thinking limits them into a more power structure a disadvantage Nicole I want to pass that one over to you and the people that you talk to did the ideas that he brings up in his video comment resonate with them that there is a structural issue here and well it's not articulated as such but it's all very obvious that there are clear gendered implications of President Emeritus policies I think what I want to emphasize here as well is that while his vulgar words matter I think words matter I think they're offensive and the president definitely must not have a free pass but I think we also have to focus on something more latent things that are clearly gendered but not articulated because the president is not drawing attention to them so for example the president's bloody war on drugs the main victims here are women these are widows these are mothers who lost their loved ones sometimes I feel like when the president says something sexist on camera we tend to focus on that which is obviously important but I think we also have to draw attention to something that's less overt and give voice to women who don't have as much voice when it comes to on this issue and I think the challenging part here is that some of the women we've talked to not a lot but some of the women we talked to unfortunately see the president as the only person who can help them with their conditions so we've talked to widows of the drug war who actually blame the police for the killings of their husbands and they would actually think that the president who portrays himself as a father figure is the only person that can help them can we blame these women for thinking that this is the only president the sexist president that can help them not necessarily and I think this is how my ideas speak to Professor contreras ideas that this is a structural issue if our courts were working if our police were less corrupt then these women would not pin their hopes on a president who may offend feminist sensibilities but also portrays himself as someone who helps women it's very tricky I'm incredibly frustrated and I really count on people like in dye and the bio home movement to help piece these together because it's incredibly complex and frustrating so guess I and I sit sit tight for a second because I want to get straight to where you're going to but I want to share something with our audience who are watching right now the humor of present-day today is is questionable but it definitely flows along the idea of women are there as a punchline so we've put together some clips to give you an example of that and then I'm going to go straight to end I have a look okay bye bye goodnight oh god my Oh see let's be sober only one of the most is a promising virgins when you go to heaven I'd like to have the Virgin's here not in heaven that may not allow it um cruising whistling or calling a woman in public with words having dirty connotations or implications is actually sexual harassment so it seems as if you violated your own ordinance do you have any reaction are sleeping on this business stopping me let me see freedom so much material right there but it wasn't any of those instances in thy that influenced you setting up a movement it was this headline here next Ombudsman won't be a woman deter Tay says that was that was the final straw right that may have been the final straw for a lot of a biacore people involved but I've been writing every time he's come out with him sexist misogynist statements let's get that clear okay but speaking of my biacore when he calls speaks of widows of drug war victims and mothers of drug war victims many of them are with the by a car and dying mothers explain the thinking behind it but by a coke is I am a woman and I don't find that there is I will fight so this movement has it's got two important rallying cries unpack them for us okay it's not just misogyny although misogyny is a big part of it okay it's also that many in Morocco see that this misogyny is only really a reflection of a lot of other fatal flaws in the third day including the autocratic streak that has led to a drug war that has killed thousands of Filipinos and many of the mothers and the wives of those appalled in the drug war I read the Bayaka because they know they see their plight you know as a reflection of a continuum of the tears tendencies and it's not just misogyny misogyny is actually a reflection of how feudal he is when he says that you know nobody stop me nobody can question me that is exactly his problem and that is how it comes out in misogyny so misogyny is only a reflection but it is something that angers a lot of women and I wanted to share the viewpoint of someone who's involved in the campaign as well Marlena says on Twitter the bar Barako is meant to empower all of us women who had been demeaned and ridiculed no end by this misogynistic president she says it's about time for us to rise up and give him a taste of his own bitter medicine we also got a video comment thank someone they weren't me I want to do comment first because she follows up on that that tweet very nicely this is no my no me and she says why she is part of this campaign how to listen the babaco campaign I am woman used to call attention and push back against misogyny but also to call attention on the Turkish attacks against institutions of justice headed by women what is the point of laws to protect women like the Magna Carta for women lost and anti violence against women and their children if the men in power exhibit chauvinistic misogynistic and sexist privilege I want to give that to you Antonio I wanted to get Antonio's take on the campaign and what you think of it well when we say we want to protect all women then you have a problem of consistency and this is what some people see that some feminists and some women's activists and some people who fight for women's rights tend to be seen as selective and this is because they are seen in a partisan lens for example there are there are people look on them to tear this were for for doing certain things that are seemingly assaulting women or attacking women and yet when the women who are victims are not on the right or correct political line then they don't say anything let me give you an example this recent controversy about the kissing in Korea K miss Kim Bayer came with the name of the woman who was kissed that since an attack against a woman and yet here you are now for example mocha Oh Sonia who has been in the controversy with the former president former president after the sister former president nahi no they are in in a quarrel right now and then the president and Bongo apologized on behalf of moko Sony which for me is objectifying you know why do you have to apologize for a woman you have to ask her first now that is not sin as an assault on women's subjectivity and it's not saying it's objectification on so many people would like to buy into the issue and yet when they began to see this as more as a part it's an attack on the president instead of going into the structural roots of the problem because it is elective when it is Serrano or Lila de Lima or Robredo being at updates they complain when it is more osan or - associate justice the cost very a very quick question for you so this I'm gonna call it a women's movement you don't buy it you don't think it's necessary in the Philippines oh it's necessary but it has to be caught in the point there has to be it has to be decoupled from partisanship because the moment it becomes partly sunny then instead of looking at the problem in a in a feminist perspective or patriarchy is the enemy or misogyny then you go back to the issue it's just being said because those who are Anthony essential people's clearing you've got women being raped when you have the president is the most glaring example of the most extreme forms of misogyny of course it is Baraka what are we saying that's a problem Antonio I I hear what you're saying right now I'm just very curious because in the last 30 seconds of this show this is an online women's movement for equality for women in the Philippines what next I know that you're planning some marches taking offline and then into real life and I we are going on we are all going on ground we're having about Bayaka March on June 12 Independence Day okay and remember standing up and say enough that just misogyny but all the autocratic and abusive tendencies are and die Nikko Antonio thank you so much for joining us today I will leave the conversation for mallika to wrap up no your this to candy who says that this movement empowers us to express suppressed anguish simply by promoting us to finish the thought many women don't get to tell their stories and this campaign helps them process their pain of course you can continue this conversation online hashtag AJ stream and at AJ stream on Twitter
