1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,180
ANOTHER STATE SUPREME COURT HAS
THANKFULLY STRUCK DOWN THE

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,680
EXTREMELY PARTISAN GERRYMANDERED
CONGRESSIONAL MAP.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:24,110
HERE I AM TALKING ABOUT
PENNSYLVANIA.

4
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:31,099
THIS IS A MAP THAT THE STATE AND
POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE STATE

5
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,320
HAVE BEEN SUFFERING UNDER
FOR SOME TIME.

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,730
IT IS IN A STATE WHERE YOU HAVE
BASICALLY SPLIT IN TERMS OF THE

7
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:45,110
VOTE, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY
OF THE SEATS ENDED UP GOING TO

8
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,270
REPUBLICANS BECAUSE THEY HAVE
PUT INTO EFFECT AN EXTREMELY

9
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,239
PARTISAN MAP.

10
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:57,719
THANKFULLY IT LOOKS LIKE FOR
THIS YEAR'S ELECTIONS WE WILL

11
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,610
HAVE STILL BIASED CONGRESSIONAL
DISTRICTS BUT HOPEFULLY A LITTLE

12
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,800
BIT MORE EQUITABLE AND
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ACTUAL

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,120
VOTE IN PENNSYLVANIA.

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:14,050
>>PENNSYLVANIA WAS CONSIDERED
THE WORST GERRYMANDERED STATE

15
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,340
IN THE COUNTRY.

16
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:21,140
THEY HAVE A DISTRICT THAT LOOK
SO RIDICULOUS IT IS CALLED GOOFY

17
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,440
KICKING DONALD DUCK.

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:35,680
IT IS 
A TERRIBLE IDEA FOR

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,450
DEMOCRACY EITHER WAY.

20
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,890
REPUBLICANS OF COURSE DO
IT MORE.

21
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,250
SO THEY GATHER UP ALL THE
DEMOCRATIC VOTERS IN DISTRICTS

22
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,790
SO THAT WHOEVER THE INCUMBENT IS
THEY WILL NEVER LOSE.

23
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,970
THEY HAVE A GIANT LEAD IN
THOSE DISTRICTS.

24
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:02,970
THAT IS WHY SOMETIMES DEMOCRATIC
INCUMBENTS DON'T MIND.

25
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,430
SO THEY HAVE THESE HUGE MARGINS
AND THE OTHER SEATS 単

26
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:17,500
THAT IS WHERE THEY HAVE TO DRAW
THEM UP IN CRAZY WAYS.

27
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,950
THEY WILL TAKE A SLICE OF
PITTSBURGH THIS WAY AND A SLICE

28
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:29,230
OF PHILLY THAT WAY AND THEY WILL
MAKE IT SO THAT MOST OF THE

29
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,340
DISTRICTS ARE REPUBLICAN AND ALL
THE OTHER DEMOCRATIC VOTERS ARE

30
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,060
STUFFED INTO THE FEW DEMOCRATIC

31
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:42,980
DISTRICTS HENCE IN 2012
DEMOCRATS GOT MORE HOUSEBOATS

32
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,570
THAN REPUBLICANS DID IN THE
STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA.

33
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,690
IN A DEMOCRACY THEY WOULD HAVE
MORE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN IN

34
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,830
PENNSYLVANIA BECAUSE HE
GOT MORE VOTES.

35
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,210
THEY SLICE THE DISTRICTS IN SUCH
A WAY THAT NONETHELESS

36
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:03,260
REPUBLICANS WON 13 OF THE
18 SEATS.

37
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,540
EVEN THOUGH THEY GOT LESS VOTES
THEY GOT 13 OUT OF THE 18 SEATS.

38
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,380
THAT IS WHY IT IS AS THE COURT
SAID IT CLEANLY AND PALPABLY

39
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,340
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

40
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,020
THEY ARE TAKING AWAY ONE
PERSON ONE VOTE.

41
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,260
>>AND THAT IS WHY THE STATE
SUDDENLY BOTH IN A WAY THAT IS

42
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,880
NOT IN THE INTEREST OF ITS

43
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,180
ACTUAL CONSTITUENCY.

44
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,740
AND WHEN YOU EXTEND THIS OUT
OVER THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THIS

45
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,860
IS WHY DEMOCRATS WILL GET MORE
VOTES IN THE GENERAL ELECTION

46
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,709
FOR SENATE, HOUSE, AND FOR
THE PRESIDENCY.

47
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:36,459
AND THEN THEY WILL NOT HAVE
CONTROL OF ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

48
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,820
IS BELIEVED THAT THE SUPREME
COURT WILL NOT STEP IN BECAUSE

49
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,390
THIS IS JUST A STATE THING,
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW.

50
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,490
WE RECENTLY REPORTED ON
NORTH CAROLINA.

51
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,770
NORTH CAROLINA ALSO THE SUPREME
COURT SAID THIS IS A

52
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,020
GERRYMANDERED PARTISAN BIASED
CONGRESSIONAL MAP, YOU DO

53
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,420
ANYONE BEFORE THE ELECTION.

54
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,280
THEN THE SUPREME COURT PUT
A HOLD ON IT.

55
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,580
NOW THERE IS ANOTHER PANEL OF
JUDGES SAYING IN FACT YOU WILL

56
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,569
HAVE TO DO IT, BUT THAT IS
BEING CHALLENGED.

57
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:09,130
YOU CAN'T JUST EXPECT THAT
BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT JUDGE

58
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:15,010
単 LOOK AT HOW NORTH CAROLINA,

59
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:19,350
REPUBLICANS ARE DEALING WITH A
LITTLE BIT OF A SETBACK THERE.

60
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:26,800
THE NORTH CAROLINA SUPREME COURT
WENT FOR THREE ROUGHLY LIBERAL.

61
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,120
AFTER THAT SWITCH THE
REPUBLICANS DECIDED L IF THEY'RE

62
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,919
GOING TO STOP US FROM
GERRYMANDERING THE CONGRESSIONAL

63
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,630
DISTRICTS WE GERRYMANDER THE

64
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,610
JUDICIAL DISTRICTS SO THEY HAVE
BEEN CHANGING THE JUDICIAL

65
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,040
DISTRICTS TO TRY TO REELECT
REPUBLICAN JUDGES TO STRIKE DOWN

66
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,440
THE GERRYMANDERING THEY ALSO
CHANGE JUDICIAL ELECTIONS FROM

67
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,100
NONPARTISAN TO PARTISAN.

68
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,450
YOU HAVE TO SAY WHAT
PARTY YOU ARE IN.

69
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,580
THE IDEA IS THAT THEY WILL NOT
WANT TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATIC

70
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,900
JUDGE THERE.

71
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,810
THEY ALSO CANCELED PRIMARIES IN
JUDICIAL DISTRICTS HOPING THAT

72
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,580
THE REPUBLICAN INCUMBENTS WOULD
THEN HAVE AN ADVANTAGE.

73
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,470
AND THEY ALSO STOP A NEW
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR FROM

74
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:14,010
ADDING THREE NEW JUDGES TO THE
COURT OF APPEALS.

75
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,840
SO THE LENGTHS THEY WILL GO TO
TO MANIPULATE THE VOTE AND

76
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,490
PERVERT DEMOCRACY ALMOST
NO NO BOUNDS.

77
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,419
>>WE ARE ENDING ON A FUN FACT 単

78
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,500
EVEN REAL CLEAR POLITICS WHICH
LEANS REPUBLICAN CALLED

79
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,650
PENNSYLVANIA THE GERRYMANDER OF
THE DECADE.

80
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,780
FUN FACT IS NOW WHEN THEY REDRAW
THE LINES TO INCUMBENTS WILL

81
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,730
LIKELY BE IN THE SAME DISTRICT.

82
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,530
IT WILL BE TO REPUBLICANS IN THE
CASE OF PENNSYLVANIA, THIS

83
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,690
HAPPENED IN OHIO WITH TWO
DEMOCRATS.

84
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,830
WHEN THEY REDRAW THE LINES NOW
THERE WILL BE A BUNCH OF

85
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,220
REPUBLICANS GOING AGAINST EACH

86
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,360
OTHER WHICH WILL BE AWESOME.

87
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,660
AND FINALLY THE FUND CONCLUSION
単

88
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,040
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS A
HOUSE OF CARDS.

89
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,729
THEY LOSE THE ELECTIONS IN
POPULAR VOTES ALL THE TIME

90
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:08,530
INCLUDING ELECTIONS LIKE TRUMP
IN GEORGE W. BUSH'S FIRST

91
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:14,210
ELECTION WHERE THEY WHEN THE
ELECTORAL COLLEGE, KIND OF,

92
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,400
BUT THEY LOST THE ELECTORAL
VOTE.

93
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,850
BUT WITH THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY
AND POLITICS, AN AGING

94
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,169
POPULATION WITH THEIR ONE LAST
GASP OF ANGER, AND ALL THE

95
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:28,680
GERRYMANDERING THEY BARELY
CLUNG ON TO POWER.

96
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,560
ONCE YOU START KNOCKING DOWN A
COUPLE OF THOSE PEGS THEY ARE

97
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,090
IN FOR A WORLD OF HURT.

98
00:06:35,090 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT COLLAPSE IS GOING
TO BE EPIC.
