1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
so how does the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Senate spend five years</font>

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,670
forty million dollars you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6,000</font>

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,560
pages of which we've been able to read

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">500 and get it all wrong how does that</font>

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen so you know I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this a</font>

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,870
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit in the book one of the things</font>

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">I learned is an intelligence analyst</font>

8
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,619
early on is it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> dangerous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

9
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,869
speculate when you speculate you get

10
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:23,580
things wrong a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,890
things right right but I'm all speculate

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,590
for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with that caveat if I think</font>

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,869
there's two things going on one is

14
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,380
senator Feinstein made it very clear to

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,719
everyone who would talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to her about</font>

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,230
this that she wanted the report to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,120
the nail in the coffin<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the country</font>

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,120
ever doing anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this again well</font>

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,910
when you're on her staff and you hear

20
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,980
that day<font color="#E5E5E5"> after day after day and your</font>

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,170
job is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put this report together it</font>

22
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,300
takes you in a certain direction it

23
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,920
absolutely takes you in a certain

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,270
direction I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that created a bias</font>

25
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,969
right in which those staffers did their

26
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,150
job that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the other</font>

27
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,710
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember what I said about both</font>

28
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,780
Democrat and Republican leaders in the

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,549
House and the Senate approving this

30
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,020
program back in 2002 2003-2004 not only

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,259
approved the program but encouraged us

32
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:27,330
go even further telling us that their

33
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,460
constituents would expect us to do even

34
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,470
more to protect them telling us that

35
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,659
they thought we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk-averse when we</font>

36
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,820
stopped the program for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a period of time</font>

37
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,470
when director<font color="#CCCCCC"> tenants stopped the</font>

38
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,939
program for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a period of time when the</font>

39
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,250
legal landscape changed to make sure

40
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,259
that we were still completely legal

41
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,030
right telling us<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> risk-averse</font>

42
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,060
that was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Democratic senator right so</font>

43
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,939
what's the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that they can they</font>

44
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,560
can get themselves out of this

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,250
discussion to say that the CIA lied to

46
00:01:59,250 --> 00:01:59,950
them at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

47
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,960
I'm about what we were doing and about

48
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,939
the effectiveness of the program that's

49
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:05,409
the only way to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> themselves off the</font>

50
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:06,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">hook okay I can't prove any of that</font>

51
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,459
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's time speculating very</font>

52
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:11,590
important for your viewers to know I'm

53
00:02:11,590 --> 00:00:00,000
speculating here
