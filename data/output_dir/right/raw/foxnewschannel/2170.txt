CRITICISM OF TRADE PRACTICES

7
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:22,224
CALLING FOR A BETTER DEAL FOR

8
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:22,558
THE US.

00:00:22,558 --> 00:00:25,127
WHAT KIND OF DEAL CAN WE EXPECT?

10
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:28,330

CITY BRIAN BRANDENBURG.

00:00:35,037 --> 00:00:35,704
A BIG DAY, THEY ARRIVED IN

14
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:36,005
CHINA.

15
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:38,107
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO

16
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:42,344

17
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:42,645

00:00:42,645 --> 00:00:45,414
BRING IT UP ON SCREEN.

00:00:45,414 --> 00:00:47,016
>> THE US HAS SEVERAL PEOPLE

20
00:00:47,016 --> 00:00:52,121
THERE.

21
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:52,821
YOU HAVE THE TRADE HARDLINERS

22
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:55,124
WHO HAVE ADVOCATED TARIFFS

23
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:58,894
AGAINST CHINA TO GET THEM AT THE

24
00:00:58,894 --> 00:00:59,628
NEGOTIATION TABLE, WILBUR ROSS

25
00:00:59,628 --> 00:01:00,129

26
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:07,736
ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE STEVE

27
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:08,370
MNUCHIN AND LARRY KUDLOW.

28
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:14,610
YOU HAVE TWO PARTIES AT THE

29
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,044
TABLE REALLY.

30
00:01:15,044 --> 00:01:15,778
IT IS A BIG CONTINGENTS WITH TWO

31
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:19,515
PARTIES, ONE THE MORE FREE-TRADE

32
00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:20,149
SIDE, ONE THE MORE TRADE

33
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:22,584
HARDLINER SIDE AND SOME PEOPLE

34
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:27,523
CRITICIZED AND SAID THIS TRADE

35
00:01:27,523 --> 00:01:28,257
PARTY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT ONCE

36
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:28,991
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO SIDE OF THE

37
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:29,725
STORY RE-PRESENTED BUT THAT IS

38
00:01:29,725 --> 00:01:35,264
PROBABLY THE POINT, TO GET THE

39
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:36,131
CHINESE TO THE TABLE AND DO

40
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:36,765
NEGOTIATION, HAVE PEOPLE

41
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:38,033
REPRESENTING DIFFERENT ASPECTS

42
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:38,767
TO BRING DIFFERENT THINGS TO THE

43
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:41,103
TABLE AS THEY TALK WITH THE

44
00:01:41,103 --> 00:01:44,807
CHINESE.

45
00:01:44,807 --> 00:01:45,541
HEATHER: WHAT ARE THE TOP ISSUES

46
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:48,177
FOR THE DELEGATION?

47
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:52,114
>> THE US ONCE CHINA TO BUY MORE

48
00:01:52,114 --> 00:01:55,484
US GOODS.

49
00:01:55,484 --> 00:01:56,218
TAKE DOWN THE TRADE DEFICIT AND

50
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:56,952
THEY WANT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

51
00:01:56,952 --> 00:02:00,756
PROTECTION.

52
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:04,126
THEY WANT CHINA TO STOP FORCING

53
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:07,463
COMPANIES TO HAND OVER

54
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:08,197
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TRADE

55
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:08,530
SECRETS.

56
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,231
THE US REALLY WANTS CHINA TO

57
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:19,541
BACK OFF OF ITS MADE

58
00:02:27,883 --> 00:02:28,617
TECHNOLOGY, BECOME WORLD LEADERS

59
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:31,854
IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE GOVERNMENT

60
00:02:31,854 --> 00:02:32,588
WILL SUBSIDIZE COMPANIES TO DO

61
00:02:32,588 --> 00:02:33,155
THAT.

62
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:37,593
IT IS UNFAIR TO SUBSIDIZE THAT.

63
00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:41,797
AND GO WITH IT.

64
00:02:41,797 --> 00:02:52,408
>> AND FORCING TECHNOLOGY

65
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:52,775
TRANSFERS.

66
00:02:52,775 --> 00:02:53,509
AND US COMPANIES DO BUSINESS IN

67
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:53,809
CHINA.

68
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:54,543
AND YOU NEED TO PARTNER WITH OUR

69
00:02:54,543 --> 00:02:56,178
COMPANIES AND HAND OVER YOUR

70
00:02:56,178 --> 00:02:56,845
TECHNOLOGY TO COMPANIES AND

71
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:59,047
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS THE

72
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:02,317
BACKBONE OF THE ECONOMY AND

73
00:03:02,317 --> 00:03:06,522
TRADE REPRESENTATIVES SAY THAT

74
00:03:06,522 --> 00:03:10,092
NEEDS TO STOP.

75
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:11,994
HEATHER: OUR GREAT FINANCIAL

76
00:03:11,994 --> 00:03:20,068
TEAM, THE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD ON

77
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:20,769
TRADE, LOOK FORWARD TO BEING

78
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:21,336
WITH PRES. XI JINPING.

79
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:22,070
AND IS NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE,

80
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:26,375
WE ALWAYS HAD A GOOD, GREAT

81
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:26,809
RELATIONSHIP.

82
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:27,443
IN TERMS OF WHAT WILL BE

83
00:03:27,443 --> 00:03:28,177
ACCOMPLISHED AND WHAT COULD BE

84
00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:28,477
DONE.

85
00:03:28,477 --> 00:03:31,547
>> YOU WILL SEE THE CHINESE MAKE

86
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:32,214
A COMMITMENT TO BUY MORE TO

87
00:03:32,214 --> 00:03:36,718
BRING DOWN THE TRADE DEFICIT AND

88
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:37,386
YOU WILL SEE THE PROMISE TO

89
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:37,953
INSERT OR -- PROTECT

90
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:38,954
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM THE

91
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:44,126
US SIDE.

92
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:44,760
AND A CREDIBLE THING, THE

93
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,394
CHINESE LIKE TO MAKE BIG

94
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:50,566
PROMISES AND NOT DELIVER SO THE

95
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:51,266
POINT OF OUR TRADE DELEGATION

96
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:52,201
AND WE NEED TO DELIVER THOSE KEY

97
00:03:52,334 --> 00:04:01,210
I THINK THEY CAN MAKE SOME

98
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,577
PROGRESS.

99
00:04:01,577 --> 00:04:05,781
AND AND THE RIGHT PEOPLE ON BOTH

100
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:06,081
SIDES.

101
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:07,983
AND THE TRADE DEFICIT AND

102
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:08,750
HOPEFULLY WE CAN COME AWAY WITH

103
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,689
A LITTLE DENT IN THAT.

104
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:14,289
AND WE DO A BETTER JOB

105
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:17,993
PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

106
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:18,726
AND TAKING TRADE BARRIERS DOWN.

107
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,128
THAT IS THE OUTCOME.

108
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:21,230
THE INPUT IS BETTER PROTECTION

109
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,365
FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND

110
00:04:23,365 --> 00:00:00,000
TAKING DOWN TARIFFS AND BARRIERS
