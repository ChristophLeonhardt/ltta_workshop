it's a phrase we hear over and over on Twitter whenever someone criticizes morally troubling anti leftist tactics used by members of the right they say what are you some sort of coward what are you worried about my principles the phrases meant has arrived the supposed moral pruning of those who criticize they must think themselves high and mighty whining about virtue or some good hard-nosed old-fashioned getting the dirt and fight them tactics would do these worries about the right and wrong just hamstring the right my principles are liability why can't those weaklings just get over the supposed moral purity and fight in the trenches now I am no fan of political cowardice I wrote an entire book called bullies in which I blasted left character assassination techniques I routinely speak on college campuses and conditions that are less than physically secure I am more than happy to tell people things they don't want to hear in political debate and I've been threatened more than once on national television by the way for my trouble but I am also a fan of principles I'm a fan of principles because without them politics becomes meaningless even those who criticize my principles have their own principles the my principles crowds highest principle is supposedly defeating the left that's the entire argument if you stick with your wishy-washy principles about civility you'll lose and if you lose my principles will be destroyed but as it turns out many of the people who mock my principles have no actual principles other than empty tribal victory never was that clearer than this week when several members of the self-appointed Trump ardent defense squad went full social justice warrior invading a Shakespeare in the Park performance of Julius Caesar that depicts President Trump a Caesar screaming liberal hate kills they stormed the stage called the audience member Joseph Goebbels and held up the production those who objected to this obtuse behavior were simply being hamstrung by my principles they then proclaimed except that there were no principles at stake here what was the supposed principle perhaps the principle was that artists shouldn't make art that invokes images of violence inflicted on a president then why weren't they upset about a rodeo clown dressed up as President Obama in 2013 maybe the principle was that radical rhetoric leads to violence then why weren't they upset when candidate Trump urged his followers to quoc protesters maybe the principle was that shutting down others free speech is bad a sort of ironic lesson for the left then why didn't they say so rather than claiming that the contents of the play justified their shutdown and why would this be a good strategy given that the self-immolating hard left's free speech shutdowns have backfired so dramatically that even Obama Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have been forced to condemn them no there were no principles here other than tribalistic hands high left foolishness unfortunately that seems to be the order of the day for a few select on the right I'm old enough to remember when the pro Trump right justified Trump's behavior on the grounds that he had to build a wall and rescind Obama's executive amnesty now only Ann Coulter has the guts to point out that Trump hasn't done either of those things and then he just enshrined for all time Obama's executive amnesty I'm old enough to remember when the pro Trump right assured conservatives that it would hold Trump to account if he were to fail to repeal Obamacare now it's ignoring the fact that he called watered down Obamacare to mean and push for broader funding what are the principles I thought my principles had to go so that they could achieve their principles but they seem rather blyde about the collapse of some of their supposed in core precepts which suggests that maybe there are some on the right who just want to fight and they forgotten why they fight and even how to fight all the matters now is winning even if they have no idea what winning looks like other than the other guy losing I'm vetting Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show okay lots to talk about today I'm going to talk about at length the Asaf loss which is just hilarious I have been all evening I would last night I was laughing my ass off it was just spectacular the good news is that he will at least have a soft landing he's probably going to end up I think his rotating co-host I'm pod save America because that's probably the only place you can go from here but before we get to any of that and there's a

show ok so last night Jon asaf loses by five points to karen handel in the georgia six the democrats had poured thirty million dollars thirty million dollars into this ridiculous race now it is important to note the reason that they thought they were going to win this race is because hillary clinton only lost to donald trump in this district by one point in 2016 the reason that this was somewhat delusional is because Tom Price who is the Congress person who just left to join the Trump administration as Secretary of Health and Human Services he had won the district in the same election cycle by 23 points in other words there are a lot of Republicans in the district who aren't fond of President Trump but who also aren't gonna vote for a Democrat just because they don't like President Trump Trump wasn't on the ballot last night Karen Handel was on the ballot they kind of like karen handel they certainly like karen handel a lot more than they like john Asaf and the democrats attempts to turn everything into a referendum on Trump really backfired against them in a significant way last night again they come tons of outside the district money in John Asif looks like it they found the one man in America nerdier than I am and they ran him for Congress and then they ran him from a district that wasn't even the Georgia SiC but I think it's important too to look at how the media played this race because it really played into why the Democrats lost here the reason the Democrats lost is because the media ran a race that the voters in the districts were not interested in running they're all jazz because back in April Asaf won 48% of the vote 49% of the vote that's because 1000 Republicans were running and so Democrats were able to consolidate their vote and nobody paid attention to the special election because it was assumed that Republicans were going to win it until Asaf came very close to winning in the in the first round then in the runoff Republicans actually showed up to vote that's kind of the short story but Democrats were claiming from the very beginning that this race was going to be a referendum on Trump is Trump doing a good job or a bad job he's doing a crappy job he's Russian spy etc etc and therefore John Nassif is definitely going to win some random district in the middle of super bourbon Georgia so here is CNN covering the race this is right after the the original round in which Asaf missed winning 50% also will face off against Republican karen handel in june for the seat formerly held by trump health secretary tom prize in a contest seen as a referendum on trump's presidency and a preview of next year's midterm elections President Trump taking credit for the results hailing the runoff as a win despite also strong showing tweeting despite major outside money fake media support and 11 Republican candidates big R win with runoff in Georgia glad to be of help the president was personally invested in the election bashing the Democratic contender and a barrage of tweets and even recording a robo call to urge Republicans to get out and vote us off we'll raise your taxes destroy your health care and flood our country with illegal immigrants President Trump beat Hillary Clinton in this Republican stronghold by just 1% last November CNN the rest of me didn't wanted to play this as it's all about Trump it's all about from now the realities in the district Trump is not particularly popular Mitt Romney won this district in 2012 by 23 points the same margin of victory for Tom Price in that same election cycle so Trump is not that popular and so the Democrat spot okay Trump is investing himself here and that's why it's very very important that he's going to lose and you can see that the fallout from that was really funny last night because CNN which had played this whole thing up as it's going to be a referendum on Trump form is going to lose this and then everyone's going to realize how toxic he is then he's going to lose 100 seats and the house in 2018 little early to say that you know that last night on CNN this is going around because very very funny you can see the media reactions on CNN the actual footage last night on CNN all the Democrats looking like they want to die this is the second funniest thing I've seen in last year the first funny thing of course is election night when it looked like the entire Democratic Party was going to reenact the the last scene from was of our dogs Reservoir Dogs anyway here here was on CNN last night - David's point earlier about Democrats kind of and Gloria about looking inward and trying to figure out how to run in the Trump era this was supposed to be the district that they could have done that because it is wealthy it is educated and the kind of voters who are in this district was supposed to be the kind the Democrats could pick off from the Republican if the Republican ends up winning it throws the whole Democratic strategy into kind of up in the air and they kind of have to figure it out all over again all right we get it we gotta take a quick break oh well more with all and this picture was the one that was making the rounds last night because you can see all of the Democrats on set looking like they're just contemplating life's meaninglessness that you know life doesn't mean anything and then you die and spend all eternity just moldering in the ground not a thought in your head because you're dead it's like they just realized about nihilism and so it's just I love this shot so it is pretty spectacular stuff I love it I love it so did the Democrats made a bunch of mistakes in I'm gonna talk about all the Democratic mistakes here because we've talked a lot about the failings of the Republican Party because the Republican Party is the governing party right now they have a majority in the house they've majority in the Senate they have the presidency and they're not getting a lot done but the nice thing for Republicans the Democrats are awful at everything they are awful at everything and so they're a bunch of sort of hot takes from the left that are worth discussing plus the real reasons why they actually lost this election so before we get to anything else with regard to why they lost this election I think that it is important to stay but the real reason that the Democrats lost this election is because they have a perverse notion of how these elections work they do not work because they're going to somehow convince Trump unfriendly Republicans to flip and vote Democrat that's not even what happened in 2016 it wasn't a bunch of Democrats who were unhappy with with Barack Obama who flips to Trump so much as was a turnout game the fact is the entire margin of victory in a lot of the swing states was lower turnout by Democrats in those swing states by percentages particularly in the black community and what happened in Georgia 6 is Democrats really needed high Democratic turnout and low Republican turnout by nationalizing the race by giving it tons of publicity instead what they ended up doing was driving Republican turnout up they elevated Republican turnout and by elevating Republican turnout they ended up losing because here's the reality folks a bunch of people who reluctantly voted for Trump which he won the district by one a bunch of people who reluctantly voted for Trump are not going to start voting for people who backed Nancy Pelosi just because you went in and you voted for Tom price but not Trump does not mean now you're gonna flip and vote for John Asaf that's idiocy and for Democrats to think that is really stupid this is why to make the whole thing about Trump he's really really dumb for a marginal vote maybe that matters but what this is really about is motivating your base the Democrats made them using from to motivate their base but at the same time they castigated Republican voters who voted for Trump by talking about Trump Russia and Trump's corrupt and Trump's evil well let's say that you're a voter in Georgia SEC or in Ohio or Pennsylvania or Wisconsin or Michigan and let's say that you voted for Trump you held your nose right if you weren't in love with Trump you're like a lot of voters in ga6 you didn't love Trump you thought he's better than Hillary but you know I'm really uncomfortable with this they pull the lever for him and now the Democrats spend the next eight months saying the Donald Trump is the most evil person in the world give power to Nancy Pelosi how many of those people do you think are going to flip the answer of course is zero none of those people are going to flip and in fact is going to drive you to the polls because you hate nits Nancy Pelosi is actually less popular than Donald Trump her current approval rating is 29% nationally if she's 10 points below Trump and Trump's in bad shape so again the Democrats made a very large boo-boo when they started targeting these what they called Republican swing voters instead of trying to drive out their own base it's exactly the same mistake actually that they made in 2016 when they started targeting Republican swing voters in Michigan as opposed to trying to drive out their own base so a couple of things number one ah scoffs chances in this district were inflated from the outset this is a congressional race not a race about Trump not a race about Trump the same year the Trump won by one Tom Price won by 23 points second Democrats nationalized this race with outside money so by pouring money in from California Asaf received more money from California than from Georgia in this race he spent thirty million dollars and now he's complaining about money in politics which is just hysterically funny by doing that they ended up destroying their own that the credibility of their own candidate what they really needed to do was keep this race under the under the radar that's actually what happened in the South Carolina district there's another special election that happened yesterday Mick Mulvaney who is now the director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney Szold district there was a there was an election yesterday the South Carolina fifth District and the Republican only ends up winning by three Mick Mulvaney won by 21 and Trump won by 18 in that district so the idea that that that was a really close race should scare Republicans South Carolina 5 should scare Republicans what Republicans should hope is the Democrats continue to nationalize every race continue to elevate every race that is polarizing to Republicans and Republicans will then turnout in South Carolina five nobody even knew it was happening and Democrats almost were able to sneak in and steal a victory in South Carolina five a district where Trump was again won by an enormous margin so if Democrats hadn't nationalized this race with outside money it made it look like Asaf was basically a carpetbagger coming in with California values that have done a lot better here the third thing that Democrats did wrong is they got Hollywood involved so Hollywood was deeply involved in this race it was ridiculous he had Alyssa Milano tweeting out last night that she needed a hug to which every male in America said sure happy to provided and Hollywood got involved by Robo calling and sending money and making a big deal out of this race this is exactly the same mistake again that Hillary Clinton made by turning the DNC into a rerun of the Emmys when you go to judge you really think a lot of voters in Georgia are deeply concerned about lena Dunham's take on the georgia 6th do you really think that karen handel slams John Asaf on this during their debate and it was telling it made a difference that's why so many of your contributions have come from liberals of California New York and Massachusetts it's why you're supported by Nancy Pelosi and folks it matters it's no wonder that my opponent didn't want to do the Atlanta Press Club debate it was going to be aired on CNN we're all folks from around the country all of his liberal supporters were going to see it and the fake Jon Asaf was going to collide with a real John all saw who is a Nancy Pelosi back liberal okay and that was the entire point that is why John Asif lost karen handel very solid Republican wins to see pretty easily for things that again Democrats made Trump the focus and by making Trump the focus they didn't just go after his policies they said listen Trump's policies are not great and Trump is kind of scuzzy instead of doing that they did what they've been doing all along apocalyptic rhetoric Trump is the worst person ever if you voted for Trump and someone tells you that Trump is the worst person ever you tend to buck against that you do okay this is like telling somebody that their girlfriend is kind of a jerk you tell someone their girlfriend is kind of a jerk even if they know deep down their girlfriend is kind of a jerk they're not going to respond well to that the same thing holds true here even people in Georgia sex you didn't like Trump still like Trump better than Pelosi and that's the fifth point Democrats still have that albatross of Nancy Pelosi hanging around their neck and finally I'll stop didn't live in the district and it's made a difference when you combine the pack who's getting all sorts of California money when you combine that with the Hollywood support when you combine that with the nationalization of the race and making it about Trump well you end up with is this image of a guy who's carpetbagging it in from another district he's a documentary filmmaker with California support and here he is trying to steal a district in good old Georgia again karen handel hammered aasif on this during the debate and it really hurt him so John I guess what I would like to know is exactly who are you going to vote for in this election got the question okay well I think secretary handles referring to my residents which is a matter that I've addressed transparently throughout this campaign I grew up in the 6th congressional district I was born and raised in Georgia unlike secretary Handel who was born and raised in Washington DC actually it is of concern to the people the 6th district that you do not live in our community and while I was born in Washington DC I didn't get to pick where I was born but the fact is I've been in Georgia for almost as long as you've even been alive you might live just five minutes outside of the district but your values are nearly 3,000 miles away in San Francisco and her hitting him again about the California values and that was the telling point now what's funny is the Democrat responses to this I want to get to the hot takes from Democrats over this whole thing and why exactly it's it's indicative of why they're going to continue losing if they keep this up but before we do that I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at the us CCA so you wake up at 2:00 in the morning and somebody's breaking in your house and you have to grab your gun and you have to shoot them first of all you don't know you freeze up because you don't have the training and then secondly if you do shoot them you're afraid that the cops are going to come and arrest you because just because you shot someone coming in your house in a state like California doesn't mean that you won't go to jail that's why you need the u.s. CCA not only do they provide training they also provide you the defense resources you need in case you're in a situation where you do have to shoot someone in self-defense that's what US CCA is for to protect you before during and after a self-defense incident well right now when you go to defend my family now calm it's too then my family now dot-com you can actually enter for five chances to win

are so pleased to be working with USC CA doing tremendous work on behalf of gun owners across the United States and perspective gun owners who just want to win 1776 dollars to buy a new gun defend my family now calm okay so the democrats have reacted to the Asaf loss in the same way they reacted to the hillary loss it is almost impossible to overstate how off the rails democrats have gone in the aftermath of hillary losing they just could not deal with hillary clinton losing the election and so that's why they went into this whole Trump Russia collusion thing this is why they went into the edge of the election was stolen from Hillary Clinton it's why that castigated the American voter is racist sexist pig and homophobe Ling down on their own stupidity they're doing the same thing now and last night was a good indicator of that this is the crowd at Asaf party you know his defeat party is what the crowd was chanting over at his over his defeat party okay so they're chanting this is what democracy looks like tell me what democracy looks like as opposed to Karen handles crowd who apparently are fascists of some sort and whenever Democrats say this is what democracy looks like what they really mean is look at all the funny-looking people around here look at how we're all diverse and such look at look at there are so many different colors and so many different races and so many different genders and so many different everything this is what democracy looks like the implication of course being that people on the other side are homogeneous white people straight white males who hate America and hate people of diverse colors and orientations and such is this is such a mistake by Democrats but this is what they continue to promulgate because when you lose you have two choices you can either determine why you lost and try to fight against that or you can blame everybody else on earth you can blame everyone on the planet except for yourself and that's what the Democrats have done they've decided to blame everybody so here are some of the dumbest Democratic responses to all of this number one in the category of everybody all the voters are terrible and Jill tulip ovitch she is a feminist writer she wrote on Twitter quote at what point is this not a failure of Democrats but toxic vindictive voters willing to elect hateful bigots okay I know karen handel Ashley I know karen handel relatively well actually karen handel is anything but a bigot karen handel is a charming gentle woman she is she's terrific I really like karen handel personally a lot and the idea that she is a hateful bigot and that everyone who's voting for Democrats is just wonderful but everybody voting for Republicans is evil is really despicable Jill philipovich continued I know it's more important it's more convenient to blame the party for just not convincing people but what kind of people vote for candidates like Hanzel or Trump first of all karen handel did not really utilize Trump support in this election cycle it was Paul Ryan and the NRCC that came in and saved Karen handles bacon the NRCC put tremendous resources on the ground they put like eighteen million dollars on the ground third anything was 13 million 18 million total came in for karen handel they put that kind of money on the ground that was not Trump those knows Paul Ryan who did that handle and Trump could not be more different in terms of temperament in terms of positions as well but Jill philipovich has to blame the Crouch says at some point we had we have to be willing to say that yes lots of conservative voters are hateful and willing to embrace bigots some are even motivated by bigotry there's no winning if Democrats keep their soul maybe we should instead try to convince all of the people of color and women to turn out instead of try and convince hateful white people etc this is what Democrats did in 2016 this was a massive lose and Democrats are going to continue to maintain this Sally cone always can be counted on for a take so hot that it that it's toasts your pop-tarts in the morning here is its ally country tweeted quote best thing that could come out of the GA six result is for Democratic Party to finally give up its self-destructive obsession with centrism yes I'm sure that if you had run a Bernie Sanders wild left Nancy Pelosi candidate in Georgia 60 would have won never mind the fact to turn handle one because she was able to link John Asif with such people definitely Democrats please run to the hard left the third thing was we need a hug group this is what Sam Olano she said group hug get in Luke Haag weird I mean I'm alright and then finally over at the Washington Post there's a reporter named Paul Cain who theorizes that asaf lost because he was too genteel says well he's just did more passionate that would be better Asaf chose the high-priest route instead of the fierce warrior it was civil disobedience rather than civil unrest and he still lost by an even wider margin and they almost forgotten Parnell this would be the candidate in the South Carolina v so the idea is we all have to act like Trump now we have to yell and scream and be brutal and all this and then we'll win no you won't win then you will lose then Trump did not win because he was all of those things he won because Hillary Clinton was the worst candidate in the history of American politics and Trump's aggressiveness was an asset even if his brutality was a drawback you can be aggressive without being brutal and and Democrats seemed to fail to acknowledge all that but please Democrats keep those hot cakes coming really appreciate it now I do want to discuss what this means for 2018 and how Republicans have to be a little bit careful in their interpretation
