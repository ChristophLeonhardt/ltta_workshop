>>  IN PENNSYLVANIA, IT IS THE
LAST WEEKEND BEFORE THE MIDTERM
PRIMARY.
THREE REPUBLICANS REMAIN LOCKED
IN A BRUISING FIGHT FOR THE
NOMINATION TO TAKE ON THE
STATE'S POPULAR DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNOR.
WITH THAT WE BRING IN OUR TALK
RADIO PANEL, RADIO HOST RJ
HARRIS FROM HARRISBURG, PA, A
FRIEND OF THE SHOW AND NOTED
EXPERT.
AND TOM HEARTLAND FROM PORTLAND,
OREGON.
I APPRECIATE BOTH YOU GUYS BEING
HERE.
>> NICE TO BE HERE.
LELAND: RJ, PULLED OUT SOME OF
THE ADS AND TALKING POINTS FROM
THE REPUBLICAN RACE IN PA.
SOME OF THE WORDS THROWN AROUND,
SLIMEBALL, DEADBEAT, PHONY AND
THOSE ARE THE NICE ONES.
UP THERE REAGAN'S 11TH
COMMANDMENT SOMEHOW GOT
FORGOTTEN.
>> WELL, IT DID AND I THINK IT'S
BECAUSE SCOTT WAGNER'S CURRENT
STATE SENATOR HAD SUCH A SIZABLE
LEAD THAT PAUL MANGO THOUGHT HE
HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO REALLY
SEPARATE HIMSELF.
NOW, THEY ARGUE WHO WENT
NEGATIVE FIRST, BUT I THINK THAT
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT PAUL
MANGO'S COMMERCIALS WERE REALLY
JUST BRUTAL AND LAURA ELLSOWRTH
IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS LOOKING
GOOD BECAUSE SHE REALLY DIDN'T
PARTICIPATE EXCEPT POINTING OUT
THE FACT THAT THEY WERE AT EACH
OTHER'S THROATS.
LELAND: IN THE POST TRUMP ERA,
DOES TAKING THE HIGH ROAD MATTER
ANYMORE?
>> I DON'T BELIEVE SO, IN FACT,
SUSQUAHANNA POLLING RELEASED A
POLL ON THURSDAY THAT SHOWS THAT
SCOTT WAGNER'S AT 37%, AND
MANGO'S AT 22.
LAURA ELLSOWRTH THOUGH WENT FROM
2% TO 18.
SO, SHE HAD QUITE A BIT OF A
JUMP AND IT'S ABOUT 22%
UNDECIDED, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THE NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING THAT
WENT ON, SCOTT WAGNER STILL HAS
A PRETTY COMMANDING LEAD.
LELAND: TOM, WHAT ALWAYS HAPPENS
WITH RJ IS DESCRIBING THERE IN
OHIO, IS THAT EVERYBODY IS
BEATING UP ON EACH OTHER ON THE
REPUBLICAN SIDE AND YOU'VE GOT
GOVERNOR WOLF THERE, THE
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR, WHO IS
SKATING THROUGH UNSCATHED AND
PROTECTING HIS WAR CHEST RIGHT
NOW.
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT HE'S
RECORDING EVERY ONE OF THESE ADS
OF THE REPUBLICANS ATTACKING
EACH OTHER?
>> YEAH, PART OF THE PROBLEM, I
THINK, THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE
RIGHT NOW IS THE TONE THAT'S
BEEN SET FROM THE TOP, FROM THE
TRUMP CRIME FAMILY ON DOWN,
WHERE, YOU'VE GOT THE WHITE
HOUSE REFUSING TO WALK BACK A
STATEMENT BY ONE OF THEIR
STAFFERS THAT JOHN MCCAIN IS
JUST DYING, DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S REALLY TRAGIC THE TONE THAT
HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND I THINK
IT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CORE
VALUES ANY LONGER ASSOCIATED
WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, OTHER
THAN LOYALTY TO THE
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY, LOYALTY
TO THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY,
LOYALTY TO THE POLLUTERS, NO
LOYALTY TO THE AVERAGE AMERICAN.
LELAND: RJ WANTS TO GET IN HERE
ON A COUPLE OF THE TALKING
POINTS.
>> GO FOR IT.
LELAND: I'LL ASK YOU THIS, RJ,
THE PRESIDENT'S COATTAILS IN
PENNSYLVANIA AREN'T WHAT YOU
THINK THEY'D BE FOR A MAN WHO
TURNED THAT STATE RED.
>> I THINK THAT WE'RE REALLY
TAKING THE CANDIDATES AS THEY
COME HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA, BUT,
YOU KNOW, THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NOT MARRIED
TO ALL THE THINGS THAT TOM
TALKED ABOUT.
THE TAX CUTS WERE FOR THE
WORKING PEOPLE.
>> THEY'RE FOR BILLIONAIRES.
>> COME ON, REAL?
I SAW AN INCREASE IN MY PAYCHECK
AND I'M A WORKING STIFF.
>> IF YOU WERE A BILLIONAIRE YOU
HAD A HE SEE A REAL INCREASE.
LELAND: ISN'T THAT HOW--
>> THAT WASN'T FOR THE OBAMA TAX
CUTS, IT WAS THE LARGEST TAX CUT
FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS IN THE
HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.
THIS WAS LARGEST TAX CUT FOR THE
BILLIONAIRES IN THE HISTORY OF
THE UNITED STATES.
>> ALL OBAMAS EVER DONE IS GIVE
MONEY AWAY AND WE WORKING PEOPLE
HAVE TO GO OUT AND PAY FOR IT.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU OUGHT TO
GO BECOME A BILLIONAIRE, THAT'S
WHAT THE AMERICAN DREAM IS
ABOUT.
>> THE AMERICAN DREAM IS RAISE
YOUR KIDS, HAVE A DECENT JOB AND
BE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS.
>> AND, AND HAVE THE
GOVERNMENT--
AND TOM.
>> WE SHOULD BE JEALOUS OF THE
RICH PEOPLE AND WAIT FOR THEIR
