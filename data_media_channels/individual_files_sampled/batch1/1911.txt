a 19th century fort overlooks the French city of Grenoble it was built to defend the city that is close to the Swiss and Italian borders and tucked into the foothills of the Alps these days the Town Council is doing its best to welcome people who arrive here it provides emergency shelter for refugees mainly from Africa Kosovo or Albania people are coming from squats settlements and this is a first possibility for them to get stable life with more refugees arriving in France each year the government's decided to change the country's immigration policy the government's proposed immigration law would speed up asylum procedures it would also provide more refugee housing at the same time it would mean longer periods and detention for those who've had their asylum requests rejected and it would increase deportation the French president says it's all about France continuing to welcome what he calls genuine asylum seekers were cracking down on so-called economic migrants critics of the proposed law say it's too tough Grenoble mayor says the city's seen an increasing number of refugees and the state has a duty to protect them the government decided to have a very strong and odd policy around immigrants but actually this policy doesn't work at all the immigration plans have also created rare divisions in the president's own party some MPs a French values are being forgotten detention centres are becoming prisons which are unworthy of our Republic in last year's presidential election emmanuel McLaws main rival was the anti-immigration candidate marine lepen for some analysts the planned law is an attempt by the centrist president to stop a resurgence of the far-right the voters of marine lepen haven't vanished having disappeared and when you see what happened in Germany where Chancellor Merkel greeted million refugees and migrants and then had 92 far-right MP is elected in the in the next elections I think this has been seen as a lesson for the neighboring countries of Germany and particularly France where the far-right is is very powerful form a core it's a political gamble he may please some on the political right and far-right but he risks alienating many on the Left who've supported him until now in the meantime refugees like these will continue to try and reach France in the hope of a better life Natasha butler al jazeera Grenoble
