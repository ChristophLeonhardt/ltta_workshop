do you have that tractor warmed up and gassed up and ready to pull those wind turbines out of the ground like you promised well Doug Ford's the leader so we'll have to talk about that Tonya how does it feel especially in the last week we've seen these vicious newspaper stories smearing you as a homophobe and Islamophobe and yet I look around this room at all your supporters it's a complete multicultural mosaic I guess if you're a bigot you wouldn't be attracting these people here today what is it isn't that true well I think Kathleen Wynne's knows no bounds and these attacks will come out and I am fearless and I have thick skin and I'm used to deflecting these kind of attacks but as you as you said as you saw tonight you know I'm a daughter of immigrants Mississauga Centre is one of the most diverse ridings in this province and I'm happy and honored to have such a diverse team and we're coming together we're going to turn this riding blue come June so it looks like the smear tactics didn't work and there was even a planned protest that was to happen an hour before the nomination meeting nobody showed up so I guess you know when it comes to believing what the men and women on the street have to say as opposed to greasy wheel spokespeople it's a different dichotomy isn't it well I think people realize that I speak very plainly that I believe in freedom of religion and freedom of expression that's very important and I speak about this often and people made their choice I went on the first ballot and I'm grateful to the residents of Mississauga Centre and to my fellow party members that they've put their trust in me to be their voice we had a real feisty race today but there was other news in PC land 11 candidates have been appointed no nomination race a lot of people feel betrayed by that what do you feel about this I mean you know I just I'm hearing the news I think just within the last few minutes so I don't really have a comment about it I know we're really close to being in the right period so I'm not sure if that played into it but we just need to kind of focus our energy now on June and winning and making sure that we we get we defeat the 15 years of liberal tyranny that has ruled this province you know there there are accusations or rumors that these are sort of Patrick Brown accolades in the PC Party this isn't coming from Doug Ford himself have you heard anything about that sorry there are some rumors that the what's behind the appointments as opposed to nominations is that these are Patrick Brown loyalists in the PC party that are directing this is that if there you have heard I only just found out actually today about like a few minutes ago about the nominations or the appointments so I have I have no idea I'm sorry personally how do you feel about that though look I think everybody wants a nominations but we are right up against oh we never thought we'd be in a leadership this close to an election and now we are mere days away from the writ period so sometimes things have to be done because we're right there at the at the at we're right abutting an election I'm glad I won my nomination I was happy to fight it for the past four weeks that means a lot to me and I'm happy to represent the the residents Mississauga Center last question assuming you do win this writing do you have that tractor warmed up and gassed up and ready to pull those wind turbines out of the ground like you promised well Doug Ford's the leader so we'll have to ask Doug about that they get a different kind of Ford to do that heavy work event there we go we could combine tractors you
