13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,510
just been<font color="#CCCCCC"> having a really difficult time</font>

14
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,360
putting any of my thoughts or feelings

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,730
into words but basically the gist of

16
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,670
them is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you think this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a new</font>

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,579
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is surprising that this</font>

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,410
level of racism still exists in our

19
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,360

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,430
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that we live in this</font>

53
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,149
good for our environment but also

54
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:12,340
slightly more terrifying if they
