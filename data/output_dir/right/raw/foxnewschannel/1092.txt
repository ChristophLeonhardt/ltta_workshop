WAS INSPIRING BECAUSE IT WAS

17
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,101
INSPIRING.

18
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:37,136
DEMOCRATS ARE CONTINUING TO

00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:39,071
INSULT YOUR INTELLIGENCE THAT IT

20
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:39,805

CITIZENS WANTED THEM TO DO WHEN

40
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:18,377
THEY GOT THE INFORMATION THEY

41
00:01:18,377 --> 00:01:19,378
GOT IT AND IT HAD NOTHING TO DO

42
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:21,714
WITH DONALD TRUMP.

43
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,216

00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:58,310
>> Tucker: SLOW DOWN.

86
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,011

UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

93
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:09,888

I UNDERSTAND, YOU JUST CONFIRMED

102
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:28,407
THAT WHATEVER REPUBLICAN LEADERS

103
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:29,408
SAY YOU BELIEVE.

104
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,410

106
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:39,618
SUGGEST TO ME, SPECULATE GO

107
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:42,655
CRAZY AS A FORMER LAW PROFESSOR,

108
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,056
THE FACTS THAT I JUST LAID OUT

109
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:44,757
THAT ARE NOT CONTESTED DO NOT

110
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,893
AMOUNT TO SPYING -- NOT WHETHER

111
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:49,595
THERE JUSTIFIED, BUT WHETHER

112
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:52,464
IT'S SMILING.

113
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:54,500
>> ANY REPUBLICAN WHO SAW A

114
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,868
SHRED OF EVIDENCE THAT THE OBAMA

115
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,136
ADMINISTRATION WASN'T SPYING ON

116
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:57,936
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WOULD CLEARLY

117
00:03:57,936 --> 00:04:02,808
HAVE SAID IT WAS SPYING.

118
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:04,843

119
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:07,079

I'M ASKING YOU AS SOMEONE

121
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,683

GIVEN WHAT I JUST SAID I'M GOING

123
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,184
TO ASK YOU FOR THE THIRD TIME

124
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:14,653
IT'S REALLY SIMPLE.

125
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:16,654
I'M NOT ASKING WHETHER IT WAS

126
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:18,656
JUSTIFIED OR NOT, IT MAY HAVE

127
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:19,491
BEEN.

128
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:22,294
WHY IS THAT NOT SPYING?

129
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:22,995
SECRETLY GATHERING INFORMATION

130
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:24,863
ON SOMEBODY AND PASSING IT BACK

131
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:25,497
TO YOUR HANDLERS IN THE

132
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:27,666
ADMINISTRATION IS EXPIRING BUT

133
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,101
YOU WON'T CONCEDE IT IS BECAUSE

134
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:32,271
TREY GOWDY SAYS IT'S NOT?

135
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:34,440
I'M CONFUSED BY THIS

136
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,074
CONVERSATION.

137
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,975
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER A

138
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:42,381
DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN -- THE

139
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:43,849
FBI HAS A JOB TO DO, IF THE

140
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:47,486
RUSSIANS ARE TRYING TO

141
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:48,721
DESTABILIZE OUR COUNTRY AS

00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,255

DEDESTABILIZE WESTERN

DEMOCRACIES FOR A HUNDRED YEARS

145
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,325
OUR FBI HAS AN OBLIGATION TO

146
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:54,059
FIND OUT WHO WAS INTERFACING

147
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:57,129
WITH THE RUSSIANS AND THEY GOT

148
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,363
THE FISA WARRANTS FROM THE JUDGE

149
00:04:58,363 --> 00:05:04,369
AND FOLLOW THEM FAITHFULLY.

150
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:05,304
>> Tucker: WAS THERE IF I

151
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:10,843
WARRANT IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE?

152
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:11,543
THE FIRST CONTACT BETWEEN THE

A WANT FOR THAT?

160
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:29,328
>> THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE, THE

161
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:37,102
FBI ACTED INAPPROPRIATELY.

162
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:38,403
THEY'VE CONCLUDED THE FBI -- YOU

163
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:41,406

191
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:32,724
THE UNITED STATES AND IT

192
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:36,261
DESTABILIZING OUR COUNTRY.

193
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:37,563
>> Tucker: I WOULD LIKE TO

194
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,730
KNOW MORE AND YOU'RE ATTACKING

195
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,464
ME FOR WANT TO KNOW MORE.

196
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:42,434
WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW WHO

197
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:43,035
AUTHORIZED THIS?

198
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,636
ON WHAT LEGAL BASIS DID THIS

199
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:45,270
TAKE PLACE?

200
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,205
ARE THESE INTERESTING QUESTION

201
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,506
TO YOU OR DO YOU THINK IT'S

202
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:51,043
UNPATRIOTIC TO ASK THEM?

203
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,046
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHY THE FBI

204
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,647
DIDN'T UNCOVER WHAT THE TRUMP

205
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:57,482
CAMPAIGN WAS DOING IN 2016

206
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:58,116
INCLUDING THE TRUMP TOWER

207
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:59,284
MEETING AND BLOW THE COVER ON

208
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:00,652
THAT, SO WE WOULD HAVE KNOWN

209
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:02,621
ABOUT THAT BEFORE THE ELECTION.

210
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:04,256
WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THAT

211
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:06,058
AND THE FBI DIDN'T DISCLOSE WHAT

212
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,125
THEY KNEW ABOUT THE RUSSIANS AND

213
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,261
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COLLUDING.

214
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:09,995
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD AND

215
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:13,498
THAT'S WRONG.

216
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:14,199
>> Tucker: I DON'T UNDERSTAND

217
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,004
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

218
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:23,242
UNFORTUNATELY WERE OUT OF TIME.

219
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,743
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR SENATE RACE

220
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:25,544
I HOPE VOTERS UNDERSTAND WHAT

221
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:30,649
YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE I CAN'T.

222
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:31,650
ANDREW McCARTHY IS A FORMER

223
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,384
ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE

224
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:33,085
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

225
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:37,589
AND HE JOINS US TONIGHT.

226
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:41,493
THE SEMANTIC SMOKE SCREEN, I

227
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:43,061
THINK IT IS A SEMANTIC

228
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:43,762
SMOKE SCREEN IF YOU DISAGREE

229
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:44,096
TELL ME.

230
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:52,804
THE DEEPER QUESTION IS IS THERE

231
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:54,439
A PRIZE A WARRANT FOR THIS?

232
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:57,209
>> THERE IS A SEMANTIC

233
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:58,410
DIFFERENCE, EVEN CHAIRMAN TREY

234
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,812
GOWDY WHO OBJECTED TO THE WORD

235
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:02,648
SPY INSISTED IT WAS AN

236
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,015
INFORMANT.

237
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,850
ON ONE SIDE OF THIS YOU HAVE

238
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,852
PEOPLE WHO WERE ENGAGED IN

239
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:08,120
HYPERBOLE, THEY WERE ENGAGED IN

240
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,820
EUPHEMISM BUT YOU'RE TALKING

241
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,256
ABOUT THE SAME THING.

242
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:12,291
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A COVERT

243
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,660
OPERATIVE WHO WAS SENT GAIN

244
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,061
INFORMATION.

245
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:18,864
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A FISA

246
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:21,700
SURVEILLANCE WARRANT TO USE ON

247
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,734
INFORMANT, IN FACT IT'S A PRETTY

248
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:25,671
LOW STANDARD.

249
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,838
WE KNOW THERE WAS SOME FISA

250
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:28,040
SURVEILLANCE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

251
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,840
MORE THAN WE KNOW ABOUT BUT THAT

252
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,477
BEGAN IN OCTOBER AND IT WENT FOR

253
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:34,546
BASICALLY MOST OF THE NEXT YEAR

254
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:38,482
WELL INTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

255
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:40,552
THEY WERE USING ON INFORMANT OR

256
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:44,323
A SPY -- AT LEAST ONE, AT LEAST

257
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,057
BEGINNING IN JULY AND I THINK

258
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:49,428
THE ISSUE HERE IS WHY THEY WERE

259
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,631
DOING IT, NOT WHAT YOU CALL IT.

260
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:53,765
THE MOST OBJECTIONABLE THING I

261
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:55,767
HEARD FROM YOUR LAST GUEST WAS

262
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,302
HE KEPT SAYING THE PEOPLE WHO

263
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:59,271
LOOKED AT THE CLASSIFIED

264
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:02,040
INFORMATION -- IN POINT OF FACT,

265
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,242
THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THE CLASSIFIED

266
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:04,643
INFORMATION.

267
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:05,477
A BIG PART OF WHAT THIS WHOLE

268
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:07,946
DEBATE HAS BEEN ABOUT HAS BEEN

269
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:09,648
THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

270
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:10,782
ASKING FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS

271
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:12,484
FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND

272
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:14,219
THE FBI TO SEE THE CLASSIFIED

273
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,221
INFORMATION AND THEY HAVE BEEN

274
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:18,023
STONEWALLED.

275
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:19,257
>> Tucker: THAT CONVERSATION

276
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:19,992
WAS DEMENTED I'M STILL CONFUSED

277
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,194
BY IT.

278
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,730
THE CORE QUESTIONS REMAIN TELL

279
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,865
ME IF I'VE GOT THE TIME I'M

280
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:29,701
WRONG, APPARENTLY THE

281
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,236
CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN

282
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:32,437
MISS INFORMANT IN THE TRUMP

283
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:33,071
CAMPAIGN BEGAN BEFORE THE

284
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:34,206
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

285
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,641
INVESTIGATION INTO CAMPAIGN TIES

286
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:39,578
TO RUSSIA BEGAN.

287
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:44,449
>> THE INVESTIGATION IS FORMALLY

288
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:47,285
OPENED WE THINK AROUND JULY

289
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:47,652
JULY 31ST.

290
00:09:47,652 --> 00:09:49,421
WE ARE ALLOWED TO DO PRELIMINARY

291
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:51,923
STEPS BEFORE THEY OPEN A FULL

292
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:53,058
THROTTLE INVESTIGATION AND

293
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:54,326
PRESUMABLY THEY USED THAT

294
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:55,060
AUTHORIZATION OR THAT AUTHORITY

295
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,297
THAT THEY HAVE TO USE INFORMANTS

296
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:00,232
THAT THEY HAVE TO USE INFORMANT

297
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:00,632
INFORMANTS.

298
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:02,034
WE ARE SPECULATING BUT WE

299
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,268
SHOULDN'T BE SPECULATING AT THIS

300
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:04,870
POINT, WE SHOULD KNOW THE

301
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,437
ANSWERS.

302
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:06,505
WE SHOULD BE NOW AT THIS POINT

303
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:10,242
ABLE TO SAY EXACTLY WHEN THIS

304
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,043
INVESTIGATION OPENED NOT ON

305
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,212
PAPER BUT WHEN IT REALLY OPENED.

306
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:18,250
WHEN THEY STARTED TO DO STUFF.

307
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,851
>> Tucker: WE ARE OUT OF TIME

308
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:21,053
BUT FACT-CHECK IT FOR ME.

309
00:10:21,053 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU NEED A HIGH BAR TO DO THIS.
