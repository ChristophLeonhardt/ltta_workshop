SPECIAL REPORT.

00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,351
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FORMER LAWYER 

7
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,420
MICHAEL COHEN HAS REACHED A PLEA

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,322
DEAL WITH PROSECUTORS ON SEVERAL

9
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,625
COUNTS OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE 

10
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:29,095
VIOLATIONS, BANK FRAUD AND TAX 

11
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:29,562
EVASION.

12
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,563
MICHAEL COHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

13
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:33,867
LONG TIME PERSONAL ATTORNEY AND 

14
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,801
COUNSEL.

15
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,636
IN THE 2016 CAMPAIGN HE WAS 

16
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:40,240
INVOLVED IN PAYMENTS TO STORMY 

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,975
DANIELS AS PART OF AN AFFAIR 

18
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:45,845
WITH MR. PRESIDENT TRUMP AS WELL

19
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:50,849
AS KAREN McDOcDOUGAL.

20
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:53,887
NOW HE'S AGREED TO PLEAD GUILTY.

21
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,588
ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES THIS 

22
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:59,859
WOULD INCLUDE A MONETARY 

23
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,095
FORFEITURE AND JAIL TIME FOR 

24
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:02,395
MR. COHEN.

25
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,465
WE WANT TO BRING IN PIERRE 

26
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:05,698
THOMAS.

27
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,433
THIS COULD BE FILED AS EARLY AS 

28
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:10,002
TODAY UP UNTIL THE TITLE IT'S 

29
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:12,105
FILED IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE ONE OR 

30
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,573
MORE PARTIES COULD BACK OUT.

31
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,409
WE BELIEVE AN AGREEMENT HAS BEEN

32
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,110
REACHED.

33
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,246
IT WOULD INCLUDE JAIL TIME FOR 

34
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:20,846
MICHAEL COHEN.

35
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:24,250
MUST SIGNIFICANT THE TWO 

36
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,687
CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW VIOLATIONS.

37
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,355
THAT INCLUDES DEALINGS WITH  

38
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:29,755
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

39
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:31,224
>> THAT'S RIGHT GEORGE.

40
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:34,294
WE BELIEVE THIS DEAL IS EMINENT.

41
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,095
EITHER PARTY COULD BACK OUT.

42
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:39,666
WE BELIEVE THE DEAL IS IMMINENT.

43
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,402
YOU'RE RIGHT.

44
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:43,502
THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATIONS 

45
00:01:43,502 --> 00:01:44,704
ARE INTERESTING.

46
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,106
THEY INVOLVE HUSH MONEY 

47
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:50,076
INVOLVING WOMEN WHO ALLEGEDLY 

48
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:50,777
HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE 

49
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,711
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

50
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,279
AGAIN, THE TIMING WAS KEEPING 

51
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,647
THIS INFORMATION OUT OF THE 

52
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,549
PRESS BEFORE THE ELECTION, 

53
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,116
GEORGE.

54
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:58,051
THAT'S WHY IT'S KEY.

55
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,986
WE DON'T KNOW IF HIS COOPERATION

56
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,322
WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT, 

57
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:02,555
GEORGE. 

58
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,091
>> THE PAYMENTS HE MADE WOULD BE

59
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,926
A CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION.

60
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,662
I ALSO WANT TO BRING IN CHRIS 

61
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,497
CHRISTIE FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW 

62
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:12,265
JERSEY.

63
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,233
FORMER U.S. PROSECUTOR AS WELL 

64
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:16,535
IN NEW JERSEY.

65
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:19,338
A LONG TIME ALLY ALSO OF 

66
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:20,173
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

67
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,276
SIGNIFICANT MOVE HER TODAY, 

68
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:23,643
CHRIS?

69
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,478
>> IT IS A SIGNIFICANT MOVE, 

70
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,212
GEORGE.

71
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,880
THE REAL QUESTION NOW IS DOES 

72
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,385
THIS PLEA INCLUDE COOPERATION BY

73
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:32,819
MICHAEL COHEN.

74
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,320
IS IT A NONCOOPERATING PLEA 

75
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,656
WHERE HE'S LOOKING FOR CREDIT 

76
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,491
FOR ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY 

77
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,760
WHICH WOULD REDUCE HIS JAIL 

78
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,261
SENTENCE?

79
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,963
>> THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT.

80
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,665
ON THAT POINT EVEN IF THIS IS 

81
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,335
NOT A COOPERATING AGREEMENT IT 

82
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,803
DOESN'T PRECLUDE COOPERATING 

83
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:51,971
DOWN THE ROAD, CORRECT?

84
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:55,675
>> IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE IT.

85
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,276
ALTHOUGH, GEORGE, IF YOU'RE THE 

86
00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:59,112
DEFENDANT YOU'VE WANT TO GET 

87
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,379
CREDIT FOR THAT COOPERATION 

88
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,282
RIGHT UPFRONT NOW.

89
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,716
THAT WOULD IMPACT HOW MANY 

90
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,585
COUNTS YOU HAVE TO PLEAD GUILTY 

91
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,053
TO AND WHAT LEVEL YOU'RE 

92
00:03:08,053 --> 00:03:08,921
SENTENCED AT.

93
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:11,524
MY GUESS IS IS THIS IS A 

94
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,792
COOPERATING DEAL IT'S ALREADY 

95
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:13,326
BEEN STRUCK.

96
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,060
IF IT'S NOT, THAT'S SIGNIFICANT 

97
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,928
GOING DOWN THE ROAD. 

98
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:17,396
>> TALK ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE 

99
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:20,232
IF IT'S NOT A COOPERATING DEAL. 

100
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:25,138
>> AGAIN, THAT MAKES IT LESS 

101
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,140
PROBLEMATIC FOR THE TRUMP 

102
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,975
CAMPAIGN.

103
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,008
IF MICHAEL COHEN IS NOT GOING TO

104
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:31,511
COOPERATE AND PROVIDE 

105
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,480
INFORMATION TO THE GOVERNMENT, 

106
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,215
THAT WOULD PUT MORE FLESH ON 

107
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:37,817
POTENTIAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE 

108
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,953
VIOLATIONS THAT MAKES ANY CASE 

109
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:42,689
AGAINST ANYONE ELSE IN THE TRUMP

110
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,623
CAMPAIGN MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO 

111
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:49,061
PURSUE AND PROVE WITH THE 

112
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,596
COOPERATION OF MICHAEL COHEN.

113
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:52,164
THAT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER. 

114
00:03:52,164 --> 00:04:00,173
>> I WANT TO BRING IN CECELIA 

115
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:00,373
VEGA. 

116
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,974
>> WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT 

117
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:02,274
COOPERATION.

118
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:03,409
THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 

119
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,944
PEOPLE INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE 

120
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,446
FEAR THE MOST, THAT MICHAEL 

121
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:09,282
COHEN COOPERATING WITH ROBERT 

122
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,317
MUELLER'S TEAM WOULD BE A HUGE 

123
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:15,054
BLOW TO THIS WEST WING.

124
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,488
JUST MICHAEL COHEN BEING AT THE 

125
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:18,257
CENTER OF THE INVESTIGATION HAS 

126
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,659
MADE PEOPLE HERE NERVOUS.

127
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:24,997
IT'S HARD TO CONVEY HOW MUCH IN 

128
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:28,334
THE INNER CIRCLE MICHAEL COHEN 

129
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:28,568
WAS.

130
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,303
IN BUSINESS CIRCUMSTANCES HE WAS

131
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,072
HIS LONG TIME LAWYER, HE WAS HIS

132
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:36,542
LONG TIME FIXER, HE WAS HIS 

133
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,412
RIGHT HAND MAN.

134
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,580
AFTER THAT RAID ON COHEN'S HOME 

135
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,518
AND BUSINESSES WHERE THEY SEIZED

136
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:46,952
13 CELL PHONES AND MILLIONS OF 

137
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:49,087
FILES IN APRIL THEIR 

138
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:52,525
RELATIONSHIP TOOK A TURN SOUTH.

139
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,327
THE PRESIDENT SAID MICHAEL COHEN

140
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,829
WOULD NEVER FLIP ON HIM.

141
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,864
MICHAEL COHEN TOLD YOU GEORGE 

142
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:01,067
HIS LOYALTY LIES WITH HIS FAMILY

143
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,702
AND WITH HIS COUNTRY.

144
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,870
THERE ARE PEOPLE NERVOUS HERE 

145
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,572
WAITING TO FIND OUT WHAT THIS 

146
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,174
DEAL ENTAILS AND HOW MUCH HE'LL 

147
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:12,345
BE COOPERATING WITH ROBERT 

148
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:12,712
MUELLER'S TEAM. 

149
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:16,149
>> MICHAEL COHEN ADMITTED MAKING

150
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,684
PAYMENTS TO STORMY DANIELS OF 

151
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:19,685
$130,000 IN OCTOBER OF 2016 

152
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:21,287
BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN.

153
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:21,954
YOU REMEMBER WELL PRESIDENT 

154
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,123
TRUMP ON AIR FORCE ONE DENYING 

155
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,958
AT FIRST ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THAT 

156
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,360
PAYMENT.

157
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,327
LET'S LISTEN. 

158
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:29,395
>> Reporter: DID YOU KNOW ABOUT 

159
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:33,399
THE $130,000 PAYMENT TO STORMY 

160
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:33,666
DANIELS?

161
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,933
>> NO. 

162
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,502
>> Reporter: WHY DID MICHAEL 

163
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,770
COHEN MAKE THAT?

164
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,540
>> YOU HAVE TO ASK MICHAEL 

165
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:40,973
COHEN.

166
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,442
MICHAEL WAS MY ATTORNEY.

167
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,142
YOU HAVE TO ASK MICHAEL. 

168
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:46,078
>> Reporter: DO YOU KNOW WHERE 

169
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:47,780
HE GOT THE MONEY TO MAKE THAT 

170
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,281
PAYMENT?

171
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:48,614
I DON'T KNOW. 

172
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:51,684
>> THE WHITE HOUSE LATER HAD TO 

173
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,118
ADMIT HE DID KNOW ABOUT THE 

174
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:53,385
PAYMENT. 

175
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:56,321
>> HE FLATLY DENIED KNOWING 

176
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:57,490
ABOUT THE PAYMENT.

177
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,326
THEN IT CAME OUT THAT THIS MONEY

178
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,296
WAS REIMBURSED TO HIS LAWYER FOR

179
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,797
THAT $130,000.

180
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:08,100
WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT KAREN 

181
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,671
McDOUGAL AND THAT MONEY PAID TO 

182
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:11,971
AMI.

183
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:15,074
THAT TAPE CAME OUT WHERE WE 

184
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,009
HEARD THE PRESIDENT AND MICHAEL 

185
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,479
COHEN TALKING ABOUT THE PAYMENT,

186
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,181
HUSH MONEY.

187
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,650
THE PRESIDENT INSISTED THEY 

188
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,386
DIDN'T HAVE THE AFFAIR.

189
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,121
THERE'S A TAPE OUT THERE TALKING

190
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:29,955
ABOUT THAT PAYMENT. 

191
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:31,157
>> WE HAVE THAT TAPE.

192
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,058
LET'S PLAY THAT AS WELL. 

193
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,160
>> I NEED TO OPEN UP A COMPANY 

194
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,131
FOR THE TRANSFER OF ALL THAT 

195
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:40,433
INFO REGARDING OUR FRIEND DAVID.

196
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,034
I'M GOING TO DO THAT RIGHT AWAY.

197
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,335
>> GIVE IT TO ME.

198
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:46,539
>> I'VE SPOKEN TO ALAN ABOUT HOW

199
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,943
TO SET THE WHOLE THING UP WITH 

200
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:51,210
FUNDING. 

201
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,213
>> WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

202
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:59,252
>> IT'S ALL THE STUFF.

203
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,819
YOU NEVER KNOW THAT COMPANY -- 

204
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:03,155
>> HE COULD GET HIT BY A TRUCK. 

205
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:04,090
>> CORRECT.

206
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:04,957
I'M ALL OVER THAT.

207
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,693
WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR THE 

208
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:08,026
FINANCING -- 

209
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:09,328
>> WHAT FINANCING?

210
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,563
>> WE'LL HAVE TO PAY. 

211
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:14,367
>> DON'T PAY WITH CASH. 

212
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:14,734
>> NO.

213
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:18,371
>> I WANT TO BRING IN PIERRE 

214
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:18,604
THOMAS.

215
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,241
WE ALSO KNOW THE OFFICES OF 

216
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,909
AMERICA MEDIA HAVE ALSO BEEN 

217
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,645
RAIDED BY THE JUSTICE 

218
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:25,945
DEPARTMENT. 

219
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,546
>> THEY WANT TO GET AS MUCH 

220
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:29,248
INFORMATION FROM THEM AS 

221
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:29,649
POSSIBLE.

222
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:30,983
GEORGE, WE DON'T KNOW THE 

223
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:34,186
SPECIFICS YET OF THIS DEAL IN 

224
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:35,988
TERMS OF HOW MUCH COOPERATION 

225
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:36,489
THERE WILL BE.

226
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,191
WE HAVE HAD FROM SOURCES THAT WE

227
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:40,926
TRUST THAT COHEN HAS SIGNALLED 

228
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:42,594
THAT HE WANTED TO COOPERATE.

229
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:45,864
HE WANTED TO SHARE WHAT HE KNEW 

230
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:49,502
TO POSSIBLY HELP HIS SITUATION. 

231
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,203
>> CHRIS CHRISTIE, LET'S TAKE A 

232
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:51,971
STEP BACK HERE.

233
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,039
WE'RE HEARING A PLEA AGREEMENT 

234
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,841
FROM THE PRESIDENT'S FORMER 

235
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,077
PERSONAL ATTORNEY ON THE SAME 

236
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,879
DAY THE SAME DAY PAUL MANAFORT 

237
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,715
EXPECTING TO FACE A VERDICT 

238
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:03,815
PERHAPS AS EARLY AS THIS 

239
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:04,984
AFTERNOON FROM A JURY.

240
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,353
THE PRESIDENT IS FEELING -- HE'S

241
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,221
GOT TO BE FEELING THE PRESSURE 

242
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:09,822
THERE.

243
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,958
WE'VE SEEN IT IN HIS TWEETS. 

244
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,527
>> GEORGE, A COUPLE THINGS.

245
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,329
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER ANY 

246
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,097
COOPERATION AT THE MOMENT IS 

247
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,432
WITH THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF 

248
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,833
NEW YORK AND NOT BOB MUELLER.

249
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,835
BOB MUELLER SENT THIS CASE TO 

250
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,203
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW 

251
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,137
YORK.

252
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,672
HE THOUGHT IT WAS BEYOND HIS 

253
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:31,076
MANDATE THAT HE GOT FROM DEPUTY 

254
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:33,679
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROSENSTEIN.

255
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,249
AS FOR THE PRESIDENT, IT'S NEVER

256
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:40,019
GOOD TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT WERE 

257
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,321
ASSOCIATED WITH YOU LIKE MICHAEL

258
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,922
COHEN HAVING TO PLEAD GUILTY TO 

259
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:45,591
CRIMES AND IT APPEARS CRIMES 

260
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,259
THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR 

261
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:48,227
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

262
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,329
THIS IS NOT A GOOD DAY AT THE 

263
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,764
WHITE HOUSE.

264
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,266
LET US NOT ALSO OVER REACT.

265
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,567
AT THIS POINT THERE'S NOTHING 

266
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,536
THAT IMPLICATES THE PRESIDENT OR

267
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,838
ANYONE ELSE OTHER THAN MICHAEL 

268
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:02,574
COHEN AND SO IT'S SOMETHING 

269
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:04,176
WHERE EVERYBODY JUMPS TO 

270
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:04,476
CONCLUSIONS.

271
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:07,079
I LEARNED AS A PROSECUTOR TAKE 

272
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,716
IT ONE STEP AT A TIME. 

273
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:15,187
>> CHRIS CHRISTIE, PIERRE 

274
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,823
THOMAS, CECELIA VEGA, THANKS 

275
00:09:17,823 --> 00:00:00,000
AGAIN.
