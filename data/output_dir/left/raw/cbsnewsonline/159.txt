1
00:16:59,317 --> 00:16:59,451
PREFER.

2
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,218
THE ONLY REASON THAT'S HAPPENING

3
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:00,785
IS ALL THE CANDIDATES MOST

4
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:01,453
LIKELY TO BE ELECTED ARE RUNNING

5
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,020
ON AN ANTI-TRUMP PLATFORM.

6
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,654
THEY HAVE OTHER PARTS OF THEIR

7
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,321
PLATFORM, AS WELL, BUT PART OF

8
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:03,922
THEIR APPEAL IS THAT THEY ARE

9
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:04,556
THE ANTI-TRUMP AND SEEN AROUND

10
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:04,856
THE WORLD.

11
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:05,523
IT IS NOT A POSITIVE OUTCOME.

12
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,290
>> EARLIER WE WERE SPEAKING WITH

13
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:06,925
DR. PAK ON EAST ASIA STUDIES,

14
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:07,592
SHE FELT THERE WAS WIGGLE ROOM

15
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:08,226
TO COME BACK TO THE TABLE FOR

16
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:08,859
TWO REASONS, NOT ONLY DOES THE

17
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:09,560
PRESIDENT SAY IF YOU CHANGE YOUR

18
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,228
MIND YOU CAN GIVE ME A CALL OR

19
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:10,895
WRITE ME, BUT ALWAYS BECAUSE THE

20
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:11,563
MOST HEATED RHETORIC WE'VE BEEN

21
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,230
HEARING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION

22
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,830
AND FROM NORTH KOREA HAS NOT

23
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,365
BEEN COMING FROM THE TWO

24
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:13,598
LEADERS.

25
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:14,232
THEYVE BEEN COMING FROM THEIR

26
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:14,799
VARIOUS UNDERLINGS AND IF

27
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,433
THERE'S ONE THING WE SORT OF

28
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:16,034
KNOW ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

29
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:16,734
THERE'S SORT OF PERSON-TO-PERSON

30
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:17,301
CONNECTION THAT HE LIKES,

31
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:17,902
FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS AND HE

32
00:17:17,902 --> 00:17:18,536
CERTAINLY GIVES THE IMPRESSION

33
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:19,170
THAT HE BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT,

34
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:19,771
PERHAPS THERE'S CHARM DEFENSE

35
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:20,405
THAT ISN'T THERE IN HIS TWITTER

36
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:20,605
FEED.

37
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:21,272
I WANT TO ASK YOU, ALEX, DO YOU

38
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:21,906
THINK THERE'S SOME WIGGLE ROOM,

39
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:22,574
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE MUCH OF THE

40
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,208
HEATED RHETORIC IS NOT COMING

41
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:23,842
FROM THE TWO LEADER, BUT COMING

42
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:24,342
FROM PEOPLE WITH THEIR

43
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:24,743
ADMINISTRATIONS?

44
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:25,410
>> THE TRUMP LETTER CERTAINLY

45
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:25,977
OPENED THAT POSSIBILITY AND

46
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:26,611
DRIVES THE BALL SQUARELY INTO

47
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:27,078
KIM JONG-UN'S COURT.

48
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:27,779
TRUMP'S STYLE, AND TRUE SINCE HE

49
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:28,445
WAS A REAL ESTATE MAGNET IN NEW

50
00:17:28,445 --> 00:17:29,147
YORK IN THE 1980s IS JUST GET ME

51
00:17:29,147 --> 00:17:29,814
INTO THE ROOM WITH THE GUY AND I

52
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:30,248
CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.

53
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:30,815
ANOTHER KEY ASPECT OF THE

54
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:31,449
NEGOTIATING STYLE IS HE SAYS

55
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:32,117
HE'S WILLING TO WALK AWAY FROM

56
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:32,751
THE TABLE IF HE DOESN'T LIKE

57
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:33,084
WHAT HE SEES.

58
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:33,618
THAT PAY WORK IF YOU'RE

59
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:34,119
CONSTRUCTING CASINOS AND

60
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:34,653
SKYSCRAPERS IN MANHATTAN.

61
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,220
THIS LEVEL OF INSTRUCTURAL

62
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,820
COMPLICITY, IT MAY NOT WORK.

63
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,488
YOU CAN SEE THE IN THE LANGUAGE

64
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:37,155
OF THE LETTER THEY'RE LEAVING AN

65
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:37,789
OPPORTUNITY FOR KIM TO RESPOND

66
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:38,490
AND BEAT THE PATH BACK TO TRUMP.

67
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,157
TRUMP SEEMS TO BE EXACTING KIM

68
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:39,791
WILL TONE DOWN AND APOLOGIZE.

69
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,392
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S KIM'S

70
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:40,925
STYLE, BUT THE OPENING IS

71
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:41,359
CERTAINLY THERE.

72
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:42,060
>> THAT'S THE QUESTION, RIGHT?

73
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,694
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO LEADERS

74
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:43,328
WHO HAVE SIMILAR TENDENCIES TO

75
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:43,962
BLUSTER IN PUBLIC, BUT IF THIS

76
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:44,596
WAS SAY SURPRISE TO CHAIRMAN

77
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,263
KIM, THEN YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT

78
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:45,930
JUST FOR SAVING FACE WITHIN HIS

79
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:46,498
OWN NATION, THE THING THAT

80
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:46,731
ALEX --

81
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:47,365
>> THESE ARE TWO MEN THAT IMAGE

82
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:47,966
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM.

83
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:48,633
>> IT'S NOT JUST THE IMAGE.

84
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:49,334
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM BUT

85
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:49,968
ALEX YOU CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT

86
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:50,268
ABOUT THIS.

87
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:50,735
HE IS A YOUNG LEADER.

88
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:51,403
HE HAS PROVEN ACCORDING TO MIKE

89
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,003
POMPEO HE'S VERY ADEPTH AT

90
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:52,637
UNDERSTANDING THE CONCERNS AND

91
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:53,271
HE'S A YOUNG, UNTRUSTED LEADER

92
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:53,972
OF FAMILY MEMBERS HE HAS TO LIVE

93
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:54,572
UP TO AND HE'S SURROUNDED BY

94
00:17:54,572 --> 00:17:55,206
PEOPLE, THEN THERE'S A LOT OF

95
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:55,840
PALACE ENTRY AND WE MAY NOT BE

96
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,508
THAT AWARE OF IT, BUT THERE IS A

97
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:57,208
LOT OF PALACE ENTRY WITHIN NORTH

98
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:57,876
KOREA, PROBABLY CERTAIN FACTIONS

99
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:58,543
WHO DON'T SEE HIM AS A VARIABLE

100
00:17:58,543 --> 00:17:58,777
LEADER.

101
00:17:58,777 --> 00:17:59,377
I WONDER HOW THIS WILL PLAY?

102
00:17:59,377 --> 00:17:59,944
TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THE

103
00:17:59,944 --> 00:18:00,412
REST OF THE COUNTRY.

104
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,012
NORTH KOREA WILL TELL PEOPLE

105
00:18:01,012 --> 00:18:01,713
WHATEVER THEY THINK THEY NEED TO

106
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:02,314
KNOW AND THEY MAY NEVER KNOW

107
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:02,847
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE BUT I

108
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:03,448
WONDER INTERNALLY WITHIN THE

109
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:03,982
PALACE HOW THAT'LL PLAY.

110
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:04,749
>> FOR A MOMENT WHEN YOU SAID AN

111
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:05,417
UNTUFTED, UNPROVEN LEADER WITH

112
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:05,984
LOTS OF PALACE INTRIGE, I

113
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:06,618
THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

114
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,018
THE WHITE HOUSE.

115
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:07,652
TO YOUR POINT, CERTAINLY THERE

116
00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:08,253
ARE LOTS OF THINGS GOING ON

117
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:08,753
WITHIN THE NORTH KOREAN

118
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:09,421
LEADERSHIP WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT,

119
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,055
BUT ONE -- IF PEOPLE AROUND

120
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:10,755
KIM -- KIM, LET'S BE HONEST, HE

121
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:11,423
KILLED LOTS OF PEOPLE IN ORDER

122
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,057
TO ESTABLISH HIS POWER, RIGHT?

123
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:12,624
SO HE CERTAINLY PRESUMABLY

124
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,291
HASSEN MES WITHIN THE REGIME AND

125
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:13,958
AROUND HIM -- HAS ENEMIES AROUND

126
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:14,426
HIM AND NORTH KOREA.

127
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,093
IF THE YOUNG LEADER, AS YOU SAY,

128
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:15,760
APPEARS TO BE NOT HANDLING THIS

129
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,294
WELL, THAT COULD CREATE A

130
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:16,928
FISSURE FOR OFFICIALS AND THEIR

131
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:17,128
POWER.

132
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:17,829
I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON NORTH KOREA

133
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:18,430
ITSELF, BUT ANY SITUATION IN

134
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,097
WHICH YOU HAVE AN AUTHORITARIAN

135
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:19,731
LEADERSHIP THAT IS LOSING THE

136
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:20,398
PLOT OR SLIPPING ON A KEY ISSUE

137
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:21,066
OF NATIONAL SECURITY LIKE THIS,

138
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:21,700
CERTAINLY CREATES OPENINGS FOR

139
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,400
OTHERS TO TRY TO FILL THE GAP OR

140
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,767
DO IT BETTER.

141
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:23,501
>> WE'RE JUST REMINDING EVERY WE

142
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:24,102
ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM THE

143
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:24,369
PRESIDENT.

144
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,036
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT TEN

145
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:25,470
MINUTES AGO OR SO.

146
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,104
CLEAR HE'S RUNNING BEHIND BUT

147
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:26,738
THE EXPECTATION IS WE'LL HEAR

148
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:27,138
FROM HIM DIRECTLY.

149
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:27,706
EARLIER TODAY, SECRETARY OF

150
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:28,173
STATE MIKE POMPEO WAS

151
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:28,473
TESTIFYING.

152
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:29,074
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT

153
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:29,641
BUDGET NEEDS BUT INSTEAD OF

154
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:30,208
COURSE MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT

155
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:30,508
NORTH KOREA.

156
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:31,142
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MIKE

157
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:31,676
POMPEO SAID WAS THAT THE

158
00:18:31,676 --> 00:18:32,310
PRESIDENT INDICATED HE DIDN'T

159
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,977
LIKE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE HE WAS

160
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:33,678
HEARING FROM NORTH KOREA, BUT ON

161
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:34,312
THE INSIDE, WHERE ALL THE WORK

162
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:34,846
WAS BEING DONE, THAT THE

163
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:35,480
SECRETARY OF STATE WAS PUTTING

164
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,114
TOGETHER -- THEY WERE PUTTING

165
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:36,715
TOGETHER TEAMS TO GO FORWARD

166
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:37,382
WITH THE SUMMIT AND THE LAST FEW

167
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:38,049
DAYS THEY SIMPLY STOPPED HEARING

168
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:38,450
FROM NORTH KOREA.

169
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,150
THAT WAS ALSO PART OF THE REASON

170
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:39,818
WHY WE'RE SEEING -- WE'RE SEEING

171
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:40,485
THE U.S. PULL OUT OF THIS AT

172
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:40,852
LEAST FOR NOW.

173
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:41,486
SO ALEX, ASK YOU, IS THAT SORT

174
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:42,120
OF SURPRISING TO YOU THAT THE

175
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,787
NORTH KOREANS WOULD BE AT LEAST

176
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:43,421
LACK LUSTER WHEN IT COMES --

177
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:44,122
WHEN IT CAME TO REALLY SORT OF

178
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:44,656
FINALIZING DETAILS OF THE

179
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:44,923
SUMMIT?

180
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:45,690
>> IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW

181
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,224
EXACTLY THE PROCESS, THE

182
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:46,791
DIPLOMATIC PROCESS THAT WAS

183
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:47,058
GOING ON.

184
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:47,659
TO MARKOS' POINT, IT WASN'T

185
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:48,293
CLEAR THERE WAS A CONCERTED AND

186
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:48,927
SUBSTANTIVE EFFORT TO GO ABOUT

187
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:49,627
THE PREPARATIONS IN THE KIND OF

188
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:50,328

224
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:11,383

THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT FOR THE

232
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,054
GOOD OF BOTH PARTIES BUT TO THE

233
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:16,721
DETRIMENT OF THE WORLD WILL NOT

234
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:17,021
TAKE PLACE.

235
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:17,655
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT

236
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:18,289
MEANS "FOR THE GOOD OF BOTH

237
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:18,957
PARTIES BUT TO THE DETRIMENT OF

238
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:19,290

00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:19,958
>> THE INTERESTING POLICY IS

240
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:20,358
"CALL ME MAYBE."

241
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:21,025
WHAT HE MEANS IS HE SEES IT HOW

242

HE WAS GOING TO PROVIDE KIM WITH

243
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:22,327
SECURITY GUARANTEED, IT SEEMED

244
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:22,927
TO BE A PROMISE OF ECONOMIC

245
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:23,595
SUPPORT, AND MAYBE INVESTMENT IN

246
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,095
NORTH KOREA, I THINK HE

247
00:19:24,095 --> 00:19:24,796
PERCEIVED THIS WAS GOING TO BE A

248
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:25,196
FOR NORTH KOREA.

249
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:25,797
THE REGIME, AND SECURITY, FOR

250
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:26,431
THE UNITED STATES, ANY WIN FOR

251
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,098
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PERCEIVED AS

252
00:19:27,098 --> 00:19:27,699
A WIN BY HIM BY THE UNITED

253
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:27,932
STATES.

254
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:28,566
HE DOESN'T NECESSARILY PERCEIVE

255
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:29,234
GIVING AWAY CERTAINLY THINGS ARE

256
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:29,868
A LOSS FOR THE UNITED STATES.

257
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:30,568
ANYTHING THAT HE CAN CONCEIVE OF

258
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:31,236
AND PERCEIVE OF AND SELL IS A

259
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:31,836
POLITICAL WIN FOR HIM AND HIS

260
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:32,470
PRESIDENCY, IS A WIN FROM HIS

261
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,037
PERSPECTIVE FOR THE UNITED

262
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:33,271
STATES.

263
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:33,938
HE MAY HAVE GIVEN AWAY AN AWFUL

264
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:34,105
LOT.

265
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:34,739
WE STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS,

266
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:35,340
VLAD BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED THE

267
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:35,940
ROLE OF THE CHINESE WITHIN THE

268
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,274
NEGOTIATIONS.

269
00:19:36,274 --> 00:19:36,908
SENATOR RUBIO IS ONE OF THOSE

270
00:19:36,908 --> 00:19:37,575
WHO SUED THIS, THE ZTE DEAL, THE

271
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:38,243
ONE WHERE THERE IS A TECHNOLOGY

272
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:38,877
TRANSFER TO THIS CHINESE COMPANY

273
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:39,577
THE UNITED STATES IS CONSIDERED

274
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:40,145
A SECURITY -- A NATIONAL

275
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:40,779
SECURITY THREAT, THAT IN FACT

276
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:41,379
PART OF THAT DEAL WAS ON THE

277
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:42,046
TABLE IN ORDER TO ENTICE NORTH

278
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:42,614
KOREA TO ENTER INTO THESE

279
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:42,947
NEGOTIATIONS.

280
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:43,615
AS WE LOOK AT THE PICTURE RIGHT

281
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,315
NOW THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN THE

282
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:44,916
WHITE HOUSE, WITH SECRETARY

283
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:45,550
MNUCHIN, IN THE BACKGROUND, WE

284
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,117
HAVE TO WONDER WHAT HE WAS

285
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:46,718
NEGOTIATING WHEN HE WAS IN

286
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:46,951
BEIJING?

287
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:47,485
WAS THERE A DIRECTION AND

288
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:48,153
DIRECTIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE,

289
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:48,853
FROM THE PRESIDENT, TO MAKE SURE

290
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:49,454
THAT HE CAN NEGOTIATE CERTAIN

291
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,121
ASPECTS OF THE TRADE DEAL OR THE

292
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:50,789
DEFICIT DEAL WE'RE TRYING TO CUT

293
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:51,389
WITH THE CHINESE IN ORDER TO

294
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:51,956
ENTICE AND MOVE KIM TOWARDS

295
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:52,390
THESE NEGOTIATIONS.

296
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,057
A LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.

297
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:53,725
THE NEGOTIATIONS I THINK AS YOU

298
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,392
SAID ARE STILL ON THE TABLE, IN

299
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:54,993
SOME FORM, AND MAYBE KIM WILL

300
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:55,393
WRITE OR CALL.

301
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:55,693
>> OKAY.

302
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:56,361
SO MARKOS, WHAT ABOUT THIS MAYBE

303
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,028
BEING A WIN FOR KIM JONG-UN IN A

304
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:57,195
WAY?

305
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:57,762
HE GETS TO KEEP HIS NUCLEAR

306
00:19:57,762 --> 00:19:58,430
ARSENAL, ON THE WORLD STAGE, HE

307
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:58,930
BEING LOOKS REASONABLE.

308
00:19:58,930 --> 00:19:59,564
HE WAS CERTAINLY LOOKING PRETTY

309
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:00,165
REASONABLE WHEN HE HAD THAT

310
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:00,765
SUMMIT WITH THE PRESIDENT OF

311
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:01,099
SOUTH KOREA.

312
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:01,733
THEY LOOKED SORT OF CHUMMY AND

313
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:01,966
JOVIAL.

314
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:02,667
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S

315
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:03,368
THE U.S. THAT PULLED AWAY FROM

316
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:03,668
THE SUMMIT.

317
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:04,335
NORTH KOREA REALLY HASN'T GIVEN

318
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:04,969
UP MUCH IN EXCHANGE FOR HAVING

319
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:05,570
THAT VALIDATION ON THE WORLD

320
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:05,770
STAGE.

321
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:06,371
MAYBE THIS WORKS OUT A LITTLE

322
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:06,738
BIT FOR HIM.

323
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:07,138
>> ABSOLUTELY.

324
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:07,772
IN FACT, I WAS ON ONE OF YOUR

325
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:08,406
PROGRAMS A FEW WEEKS BACK WHEN

326
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:09,040
THIS WAS FIRST ANNOUNCED WAS KIM

327
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,607
GOT EVERYTHING HE NEEDED.

328
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:10,241
HE GOT INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY,

329
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:10,809
HE GOT THE PRESIDENT TO --

330
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:11,409
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO SAY NICE

331
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:12,010

ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE

334
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:13,978
WORLD COMMUNITY, HE WAS SEEN AS

335
00:20:13,978 --> 00:20:14,646
SOMEONE WILLING TO DO WHAT NO

336
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:15,246
OTHER NUCLEAR POWER HAS DONE,

337
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:15,880
WHICH IS CONSIDER GIVING UP

338
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,381
THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

339
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:16,915
LET ME TAKE THAT BACK.

340
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:17,582
THERE HAVE BEEN COUNTRIES THAT

341
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:18,183
HAVE GIVEN THEM BACK, UKRAINE

342
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:18,750

BEEN WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR

348
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:22,420

TO BE CONSIDERED A DAITY IN HIS

00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:38,636
SHOULD CALL OR WRITE HIM, SINCE

376
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:39,204
JARED KUSHNER RECEIVED HIS

377
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:39,704
SECURITY CLEARANCES, I'M

378
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:40,271
EXPECTING THE MIDDLE EAST

379
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:40,872
PROCESSES TO START BACK UP.

380
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:41,406
IT WILLING INTERESTING.

381
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,040
>> WE'VE SEEN THAT BEING A

382
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,440
PATTERN WITH THIS

383
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,074
ADMINISTRATION, THAT OFTENTIMES

384
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:43,741
THERE IS A LOT OF FOCUS ON AN

385
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:44,375
INVESTIGATION, OR WHATEVER THE

386
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,043
PRESIDENT IS INTERESTED IN AT

387
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:45,710
THE TIME, AND IT JUST SORT OF

388
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,377
DISAPPEARS INTO THE ETHER AND WE

389
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:47,045
DON'T LAWYER ANYTHING MORE ABOUT

390
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:47,579
IT AGAIN AND I WONDER TO

391
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,179
MYSELF -- DON'T HEAR ANYTHING

392
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:48,847
MORE ABOUT IT AGAIN AND I WONDER

393
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:49,414
WHAT WILL BE THE FOCUS.

394
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:49,747
>> RIGHT.

395
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:50,348
THE FACT THIS IS A DIFFICULT

396
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:51,015
NEGOTIATION WITH AN ADVERSARY,

397
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:51,649
SOME WOULD CALL IT AN ENEMY OF

398
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:52,250
THE UNITED STATES AND IT MAY

399
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:52,951
PROVE TO BE JUST AS DIFFICULT.

400
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:53,618
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW IT PLAYS

401
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:53,785
OUT.

402
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:54,486
MARKOS, THANK YOU, WE APPRECIATE

403
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:54,652
IT.

404
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:54,953
ALL RIGHT.

405
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:55,253
HE HAS LEFT.

406
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:55,887
EARLIER WE WERE SPOKING TO DR.

407
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:56,588
JUNE PAK, A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE

408
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,055
BROOKINGS INSTITUTE.

409
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:57,655
WE HAD A DISCUSSION WITH HER.

410
00:20:57,655 --> 00:20:58,223
LET'S PLAY A LITTLE BIT.

411
00:20:58,289 --> 00:20:58,890
>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

412
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,524
NOTE IT WASN'T KIM JONG-UN WHO

413
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:00,191
CANCELED THE MEETING AND THAT IT

414
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:00,859
WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO CANCELED

415
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:01,159
THE MEETING.

416
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:01,826
THAT PUTS THE OWNOUS OF STOPPING

417
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:02,427
THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.

418
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,094
KIM HAS LET HIS DEPUTIES AND HIS

419
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:03,761
LIEUTENANTS DO THE WAR OF WORDS

420
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:04,395
FOR THE MOST PART, AND HE HAS

421
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:04,996
STAYED ABOVE THE FRAY IN THE

422
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:05,296
SCENARIO.

423
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:06,030
>> THAT'S AN INTERESTING POINT.

424
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,698
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IN FACT IS

425
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:07,265
BECAUSE THIS LETTER CAME

426
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:07,932
DIRECTLY FROM THE OFFICE OF THE

427
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:08,533
PRESIDENT, AND SIGNED BY THE

428
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,200
PRESIDENT, THIS WAR OF WORDS HAS

429
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,834
BEEN EITHER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE

430
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:10,435
MAKING SOME COMMENTS TO FOX

431
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,069
NEWS, OR UNDERLINGS UNDER KIM

432
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:11,669
JONG-UN, AND BY THE PRESIDENT

433
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:12,337
SENDING THIS LETTER YOU THINKS

434
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:12,971
THAT'S A DIFFERENT MESSAGE THAN

435
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:13,605
ONE UTILIZING THE SECRETARY OF

436
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,072
STATE FOR EXAMPLE?

437
00:21:14,138 --> 00:21:14,772
>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

438
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:15,373
THERE'S STILL -- THAT STILL

439
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:16,040
LEAVE SOME SPACE FOR THE MEETING

440
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,508
TO LEAVE SOME SPACE.

441
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,108
IT WAS A CANCELATION BUT NOT A

442
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:17,809
CANCELATION IF THAT HE SPOKE SO

443
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:18,476
HIGHLY ABOUT WHAT HE WAS LOOKING

444
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:19,177
FORWARD TO THE DIALOGUE AND ONLY

445
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:19,844
YOU AND I CAN SALVE THIS PROBLEM

446
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:20,512
AND IT'S TOO BAD -- SOLVE THIS

447
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,112
PROBLEM AND IT'S TOO BAD WE

448
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:21,779
CAN'T WORK THIS OUT SO I THINK

449
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:22,447
THERE'S STILL AN OPENING BECAUSE

450
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,114
KIM HAS NOT RESPONDED, IN SOME

451
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:23,748
OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

452
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:24,415
COMING FROM NORTH KOREA HAVE NOT

453
00:21:24,415 --> 00:21:25,049
BEEN COMING FROM KIM DIRECTLY,

454
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:25,650
SO I STILL THINK THERE'S STILL

455
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,150
SOME WIGGLE ROOM FOR A

456
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,684
POSTPONEMENT OR INDIVIDUAL

457
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:27,252
RESETTING OF ANOTHER DATE.

458
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:27,986
>> SO DO YOU THINK THIS LETTER,

459
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:28,653
THIS CANCELATION, IS JUST SORT

460
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:29,287
OF MORE TACTICS, MORE SORT OF

461
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:29,954
ART OF THE DEAL, LIKE WHEN THE

462
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:30,588
PRESIDENT SAYS WE'RE GOING TO

463
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:31,256
RIP UP NAFTA AND HE SAYS WE'LL

464
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:31,689
RENEGOTIATE NAFTA.

465
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:32,323
DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

466
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:32,657
SEEING HERE?

467
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,324
>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

468
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:33,958
NOTE WHAT KIM MIGHT BE SEEING

469
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:34,459
FROM HIS VANTAGE POINT.

470
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:34,859
I THINK THAT THE

471
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:35,527
ADMINISTRATION'S MESSAGE ON WHAT

472
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:36,194
IT PLANS TO SAY AND BRING UP AND

473
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:36,761
WHAT THEIR GOALS ARE FOR THE

474
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:37,428
ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN PRETTY

475
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:37,996
MUDDLED WITH THE NATIONAL

476
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:38,630
SECURITY ADVISOR BOLTON SAYING

477
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,264
ONE THING, MIKE POMPEO STAYING

478
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:39,831
ONE THING ABOUT ECONOMICS.

479
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:40,465
SO I THINK WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP

480
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,065
SAYING WHETHER THE LIBYA MODEL

481
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:41,766
WAS OUT OR LIBYA MODEL IS IN, SO

482
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:42,300
IT'S BEEN A MISH-MOSH OF

483
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,201
ADMINISTRATION, SO THERE ISOINTT

484
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:43,801
ENTIRELY CLEAR TO ME WHETHER

485
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:44,369
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE THIS

486
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,036
DECISION ON HIS OWN, OR IF HE

487
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:45,570
HAS INFORMED THE FOREIGN

488
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,271
MINISTERS WHO FROM EAST ASIA WHO

489
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:46,838
WERE IN TOWN, AND HOW THIS

490
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:47,505
DECISION CAME ABOUT IN THE FIRST

491
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:47,739
PLACE.

492
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:48,373
>> YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT

493
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,007
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS HOW

494
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:49,674
KIM JONG-UN IS PERCEIVING THIS.

495
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:50,341
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE

496
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:50,575
TIMING.

497
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,109
THE PRESIDENT THANKED KIM

498
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:51,676
JONG-UN IN THE LETTER FOR

499
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:52,210
RELEASING THE AMERICANS.

500
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:52,877
THIS IS THE DAY THAT NORTH KOREA

501
00:21:52,877 --> 00:21:53,511
SAYS THEY ARE DESTROYING THEIR

502
00:21:53,511 --> 00:21:54,145
NUCLEAR TESTING SITE, AND THEY

503
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:54,779
INVITED WESTERN JOURNALISTS, AS

504
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:55,413
WELL AS JOURNALISTS FROM SOUTH

505
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:55,880
KOREA TO WITNESS THE

506
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,180
DESTRUCTION.

507
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:56,748
WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE LIBYA

508
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:57,448
MODELLING WITH THE IDEA PROMISES

509
00:21:57,448 --> 00:21:58,116
ARE MAYBE BUT MAYBE NOT KEPT, IT

510
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:58,783
SEEMS LIKE NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN

511
00:21:58,783 --> 00:21:59,417
FOLLOWING THROUGH TO A CERTAIN

512
00:21:59,417 --> 00:21:59,851
DEGREE, GIVING THE

513
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:00,485
ADMINISTRATION WHAT THEY ASKED

514
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,152
FOR IN RETURN FOR THIS SUMMIT

515
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:01,786
AND NOW THE SUMMIT IS AT LEAST

516
00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:02,320
FOR NOW OFF THE TABLE.

517
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:02,987
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW, I THINK KIM

518
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:03,688
HAS A COUPLE OF OPTIONS, ONE IS

519
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:04,355

00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:05,590
SHOOT BACK AT PRESIDENT TRUMP

522
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,090
RESTORICALLY, THAT IS.

523
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:06,724
HE CAN CONTINUE TO PUT ON THE

524
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:07,392
CHARM IF NOT WITH THE U.S. AND

525
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:07,992

527
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,260

00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:28,146
BELIEVE THIS IS A TREMENDOUS SET

562
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:28,746
BACK FOR NORTH KOREA AND A SET

563
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:29,180
BACK FOR THE WORLD.

564
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,814
I'VE SPOKEN TO GENERAL MATTIS

565
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:30,415
AND THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF

566
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:31,115
AND OUR MILITARY WHICH IS BY FAR

567
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:31,749
THE MOST POWERFUL ANYWHERE IN

568
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:32,417
THE WORLD THAT HAS BEEN GREATLY

569
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:33,017
ENHANCED RECENTLY AS YOU-ALL

570
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:33,618
KNOW, IS READY IF NECESSARY.

571
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:34,319
LIKEWISE, I HAVE SPOKEN TO SOUTH

572
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:34,986
KOREA AND JAPAN AND THEY ARE NOT

573
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:35,587
ONLY READY SHOULD FOOLISH OR

574
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:36,254
WRECK LITTLE ACTS BE TAKEN BY

575
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:36,821
NORTH KOREA, BUT THEY ARE

576
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:37,522
WILLING TO SHOULDER MUCH OF THE

577
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,156
COSTS OF ANY FINANCIAL BURDEN,

578
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:38,823
ANY OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED, BY

579
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:39,524
THE UNITED STATES IN OPERATIONS

580
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,191
IF SUCH AN UNFORTUNATE SITUATION

581
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:40,625
IS FORCED UPON US.

582
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:41,192
HOPEFULLY POSITIVE THINK OF

583
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:41,826
THINGS WILL BE TAKEN PLACE WITH

584
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:42,460
RESPECT TO THE FUTURE OF NORTH

585
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:42,660
KOREA.

586
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,328
BUT IF THEY DON'T, WE ARE MORE

587
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:43,995
READY THAN WE HAVE EVER BEEN

588
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:44,228
BEFORE.

589
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:44,862
NORTH KOREA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY

590
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:45,463
TO END DECADES OF POVERTY AND

591
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:46,130
OPPRESSION BY FOLLOWING THE PATH

592
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:46,764
OF DENUCLEARIZATION AND JOINING

593
00:22:46,764 --> 00:22:47,432
THE OPPORTUNITY OF NATIONS AND I

594
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:47,999
HOPE THAT KIM JONG-UN WILL

595
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:48,700
ULTIMATELY DO WHAT IS RIGHT, NOT

596
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,300
ONLY FOR HIMSELF, BUT PERHAPS

597
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,901
MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT'S RIGHT

598
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:50,568
FOR HIS PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING

599
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:51,069
GREATLY AND NEEDLESSLY.

600
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:51,736
ALL OF THE KOREAN PEOPLE, NORTH

601
00:22:51,736 --> 00:22:52,470
AND SOUTH, DESERVE TO BE ABLE TO

602
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,037
LIVE TOGETHER IN HARMONY,

603
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:53,538
PROSPERITY, AND PEACE.

604
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,205
THAT BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL FUTURE

605
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:54,906
CAN ONLY HAPPEN WHEN THE THREAT

606
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:55,540
OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS REMOVED.

607
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,207
NO WAY IT CAN HAPPEN OTHERWISE.

608
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:56,841
IF AND WHEN KIM JONG-UN CHOOSES

609
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:57,408
TO ENGAGE IN CONSTRUCTIVE

610
00:22:57,408 --> 00:22:57,976
DIALOGUE AND ACTIONS, I AM

611
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:58,209
WAITING.

612
00:22:58,209 --> 00:22:58,876
IN THE MEANTIME, OUR VERY STRONG

613
00:22:58,876 --> 00:22:59,510
SANCTIONS, BY FAR THE STRONGEST

614
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,078
SANCTIONS EVER IMPOSED, AND

615
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:00,712
MAXIMUM PRESSURE CAMPAIGN WILL

616
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,245
CONTINUE AS IT HAS BEEN

617
00:23:01,245 --> 00:23:01,913
CONTINUING, BUT NO MATTER WHAT

618
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:02,614
HAPPENS, AND WHAT WE DO, WE WILL

619
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:03,181
NEVER, EVER COMPROMISE THE

620
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:03,748
SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE

621
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:04,315
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

622
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:04,816
I WANT TO MAKE THAT

623
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:05,550
APPROVAL OF $700 BILLION AND 

624
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,217
$716 BILLION NEXT YEAR LARGELY 

625
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:06,884
DUE TO THE HELP OF A LOT OF THE 

626
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:07,151
PEOPLE. 

627
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:07,785
WITH ME TODAY, AND STANDING 

628
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:08,119
RIGHT HERE. 

629
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:08,586
WE APPRECIATE THEM. 

630
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:09,187
WE HAD TO DO THAT FOR OUR 

631
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:09,487
MILITARY. 

632
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:10,154
HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING WILL WORK 

633
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:10,722
OUT WELL WITH NORTH KOREA. 

634
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,322
A LOT OF THINGS CAN HAPPEN. 

635
00:23:11,322 --> 00:23:11,956
INCLUDING THE FACT THAT PERHAPS

636
00:23:11,956 --> 00:23:12,557
, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE 

637
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,157
EXISTING SUMMIT COULD TAKE 

638
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:13,825
PLACE OR A SUMMIT AT SOME LATER 

639
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:14,058
DATE. 

640
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:14,659
NOBODY SHOULD BE ANXIOUS. 

641
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:15,226
WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT. 

642
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:15,860
WITH THAT BEING SAID WE HAVE 

643
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,527
SOMETHING ELSE, WHICH I HAVE TO 

644
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:17,195
TELL YOU, ALL OF YOU CHAIRMAN 

645
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:17,862
MIKE AND EVERYBODY, THAT WAS A 

646
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:18,496
BIG DEAL UNTIL THIS CAME UP. 

647
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:19,130
I DO NOT KNOW WHERE IS MIKE? 

648
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:19,530
CONGRATULATIONS. 

649
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,064
>> THE PRESIDENT AND THE 

650
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,431
ROOSEVELT ROOM. 

651
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:21,032
HE SAID THE OPPORTUNITY LIES 

652
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:21,466
AHEAD POTENTIALLY. 

653
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:22,066
BUT THEN SPOKE ABOUT HAVING 

654
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:22,634
GOTTEN IN TOUCH WITH HIS 

655
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:23,267
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE. HE SAID 

656
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:23,901
THE MILITARY WAS READY AND THE 

657
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:24,602
ALLIES IN THE REGION WOULD PICK 

658
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:25,169
UP THE COST IF THERE WAS 

659
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:25,570
MILITARY ACTION. 

660
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,204
WE WANT TO GO NOW TO MAJOR 

661
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:26,804
GARRETT WHO IS AT THE WHITE 

662
00:23:26,804 --> 00:23:27,038
HOUSE. 

663
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:27,705
MAJOR, THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAID 

664
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:28,339
THE KIM JONG-UN I AM WAITING. 

665
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:28,940
HE SAID NOBODY SHOULD BE 

666
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,207
ANXIOUS. 

667
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:29,874
SPEAKING OF COURSE TO AMERICANS.

668
00:23:29,874 --> 00:23:30,508
>> Reporter: WE WANT TO GET 

669
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:30,842
THIS RIGHT. 

670
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:31,409
A COUPLE OF THINGS WORTH 

671
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,010
POINTING OUT ABOUT THE LAST 

672
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:32,610
STATEMENT, IT IS CLEAR THE 

673
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,244
WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN ALL WEEK. 

674
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:33,845
THERE WAS A SENSE INTERNALLY 

675
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:34,479
THAT NOT ONLY WERE THE NORTH 

676
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,079
KOREANS BACKING AWAY BUT THE 

677
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:35,713
ADMINISTRATION ITSELF NEEDED A 

678
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:36,280
BIT MORE TIME TO PREPARE 

679
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:36,581
ADEQUATELY. 

680
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,248
JOHN BOLTON DOES NOT HAVE HIS 

681
00:23:37,248 --> 00:23:37,949
TEAM FULLY PREPARED HERE AT THE 

682
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:38,282
WHITE HOUSE. 

683
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:38,916
MIKE POMPEO IS BUILDING HIS 

684
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:39,117
TEAM. 

685
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:39,817
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ENORMOUS 

686
00:23:39,817 --> 00:23:40,518
TASK FOR BOTH OF THOSE TEAMS TO 

687
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:41,085
ORGANIZE THEMSELVS RAPIDLY 

688
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:41,719
ENOUGH AND EFFECTIVELY ENOUGH 

689
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:42,420
TO CARRY ON THE HIGH LEVEL, AND 

690
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,021
HIGH-INTENSITY NEGOTIATIONS 

691
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:43,354
CONTEMPLATED. 

692
00:23:43,354 --> 00:23:44,022
EVEN BEFORE THE SCHEDULED JUNE 

693
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:44,322
12 SUMMIT. 

694
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:44,922
GETTING IT RIGHT BECAME AN 

695
00:23:44,922 --> 00:23:45,490
IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR THIS 

696
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,124
ADMINISTRATION SEPARATE FROM 

697
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:46,724
THE NORTH KOREAN STATEMENTS. 

698
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:47,325
WHICH WERE CLEARLY HARMFUL. 

699
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:47,992
THE PRESIDENT BY TALKING FIRST 

700
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:48,593
ABOUT THE U.S. MILITARY, AND 

701
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,127
CONSULTING HIS MILITARY 

702
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:49,627
ADVISORS, EVEN BEFORE 

703
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:50,261
MENTIONING CONVERSATIONS WITH 

704
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:50,895
THE SOUTH KOREAN AND JAPANESE 

705
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:51,562
GOVERNMENT IS SENDING A SIGNAL 

706
00:23:51,562 --> 00:23:52,230
TO THE NORTH KOREANS THAT THIS 

707
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,897
PRESIDENT BELIEVES IT HAS BEEN 

708
00:23:52,897 --> 00:23:53,564
THAT THREAT OF MILITARY ACTION, 

709
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:54,165
IN A WAY THAT NO PREVIOUS 

710
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:54,732
AMERICAN PRESIDENT HAS NO 

711
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:55,400
PUBLICLY STATED, THAT DROVE KIM 

712
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,000
JONG-UN TO THE PRECIPICE OF 

713
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,701
THIS SUMMIT IN THE FIRST PLACE. 

714
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:57,235
WHETHER OR NOT THE NORTH 

715
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:57,669
KOREANS SURE THAT. 

716
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:58,069
WE DO NOT KNOW. 

717
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:58,736
IT IS NOW GOING BACK TO WHERE 

718
00:23:58,736 --> 00:23:59,337
THE PRESIDENT WAS BEFORE THE 

719
00:23:59,337 --> 00:23:59,804
SUMMIT WAS POSSIBLE. 

720
00:23:59,804 --> 00:24:00,471
WE ARE GOING TO THREATEN WITH 

721
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:01,172
MILITARY ACTIVITY IF YOU DO NOT 

722
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:01,773
ABANDON YOUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS 

723
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,040
PROGRAM. 

724
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,607
THAT IS A REAL PROSPECT. 

725
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,241
WE ARE NOW BACK TO WHERE WE 

726
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:03,941
WERE THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AGO. 

727
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:04,509
THE APPLICATION BEING, THE 

728
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,009
RHETORIC MAY HEAT UP. 

729
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:05,576
IN THE SENSE OF ANXIETY, 

730
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:06,110
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE 

731
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,778
PRESIDENT JUST TOLD THE COUNTRY 

732
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,311
IS LIKELY TO INCREASE. 

733
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:07,945
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID PEOPLE 

734
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:08,479
SHOULD NOT GET ANXIOUS. 

735
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:09,180
WE ARE MORE READY THAN WE HAVE 

736
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,614
EVER BEEN BEFORE. 

737
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,348
MAJOR, PUT YOUR FINGER ON IT IF 

738
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:10,748
IT IS POSSIBLE. 

739
00:24:10,748 --> 00:24:11,182
WHAT CAUSED THIS? 

740
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:11,749
YOU MENTIONED THE BELLICOSE 

741
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:12,016
LANGUAGE. 

742
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:12,617
MIKE POMPEO SAID THE NORTH 

743
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,284
KOREANS WERE NOT RESPONDING TO 

744
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:13,885
THE PREPARATIONS NEEDED FOR 

745
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:14,585
THIS ACTUAL SUMMIT ON THE 12th. 

746
00:24:14,585 --> 00:24:15,186
WHAT WAS THE CAUSE FOR THIS 

747
00:24:15,186 --> 00:24:15,753
CALLING OFF OF THE SUMMIT?

748
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:16,421
>> Reporter: I DO NOT THINK IT 

749
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,121
WOULD BE ACCURATE TO IDENTIFY A 

750
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:17,488
SINGLE CAUSE. 

751
00:24:17,488 --> 00:24:17,955
THERE WERE SEVERAL. 

752
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:18,589
A LACK OF SERIOUSNESS ON THE 

753
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:19,190
PART OF THE NORTH KOREANS. 

754
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,857
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD 

755
00:24:19,857 --> 00:24:20,558
SHOW UP AND IF THEY WOULD HAVE 

756
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:21,259
ANYTHING SERIOUS TO TALK ABOUT. 

757
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:21,859
THE RHETORIC FROM THE NORTH 

758
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:22,493
KOREANS CANNOT BE DISCOUNTED. 

759
00:24:22,493 --> 00:24:23,161
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE HOLD 

760
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:23,661
A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE 

761
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:24,095
PRESIDENTS WORLD. 

762
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:24,762
WHEN THE NORTH KOREANS CALL HIM 

763
00:24:24,762 --> 00:24:25,430
A POLITICAL DUMMY, THAT IS THE 

764
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,997
KIND OF INSULT THAT NO 

765
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:26,564
ADMINISTRATION CAN IGNORE. 

766
00:24:26,564 --> 00:24:27,231
WHEN THE NORTH KOREANS AT LEAST 

767
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:27,899
IMPLY THAT THERE COULD BE SOME 

768
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:28,599
SORT OF NUCLEAR CONFLICT IT IS 

769
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,267
ONE THAT WE SHOULD POINT OUT, 

770
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:29,867
AT LEAST IN REGARDS TO THE 

771
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:30,401
UNITED STATES, THE NORTH 

772
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:31,069
KOREANS ARE POSSIBLE OF WAGING. 

773
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:31,636
THAT RHETORIC CANNOT BE 

774
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:31,903
IGNORED. 

775
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:32,570
IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL OF THIS 

776
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,237
SHIFTING SENSE OF HOW REAL OR 

777
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:33,838
UNREAL THESE TALKS MIGHT BE, 

778
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:34,439
THAT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST 

779
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,006
CONVENIENT OFFRAMP FOR THE 

780
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:35,306
PRESIDENT. 

781
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:35,873
IT IS WORTH NOTING THIS 

782
00:24:35,873 --> 00:24:36,507
PRESIDENT HAS OFTEN SAID ABOUT 

783
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:37,175
DEALS IN GENERAL, SOMETIMES IT 

784
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:37,775
IS IMPORTANT TO WALK AWAY. 

785
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:38,443
HE IS WALKING AWAY TO SEE IF 

786
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:39,043
THESE CAN BE RESTARTED IN A 

787
00:24:39,043 --> 00:24:39,477
DIFFERENT CONTEXT. 

788
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,111
>> THE POINT OF WALKING AWAY, 

789
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:40,611
GIVE US YOUR SENSE. 

790
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:41,245
YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF THESE 

791
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:41,479
THINGS. 

792
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,113
THEY ARE NOT OFTEN NEGOTIATED 

793
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:42,413
IN PUBLIC. 

794
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:42,980
THIS ONE HAS BEEN PUBLIC. 

795
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,648
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ENGAGED. 

796
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,282
HOW IS THAT AFFECTED THE WAY 

797
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:44,816
THIS HAS GONE FORWARD? 

798
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,383
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT 

799
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:45,917
JUMPED A LOT OF TYPICAL 

800
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:46,217
PROCESSES. 

801
00:24:46,217 --> 00:24:46,818
BY AGREEING TO THE SUMMIT 

802
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:47,485
BEFORE HE HAD A TEAM READY TO 

803
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,019
NEGOTIATE THE UNDERLYING 

804
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:48,286
DETAILS. 

805
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:48,986
THIS PRESIDENT DOES MANY THINGS 

806
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:49,587
THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL 

807
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:50,154
THAT ARE VERY DIFFERENT. 

808
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:50,755
WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO 

809
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,422
CONCLUDE IS THOUGH THAT WAS A 

810
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:52,023
DIFFERENT TECHNIQUE AND HE 

811
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:52,557
JUMPED WAY AHEAD OF THE 

812
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:52,824
PROCESS. 

813
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,357
AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT, 

814
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:54,025
PENTAGON OR NATIONAL SECURITY 

815
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:54,292
COUNCIL. 

816
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:54,892
THE RESULTS FOR THIS COUNTRY 

817
00:24:54,892 --> 00:24:55,560
AND ADMINISTRATION BEAR A STARK 

818
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,160
AND STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO 

819
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,728
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS. 

820
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:57,361
ENGAGEMENT WITH NORTH KOREANS 

821
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:58,029
THAT APPEARS PROMISING ONLY TO 

822
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:58,596
END IN DISAPPOINTMENT AND 

823
00:24:58,596 --> 00:24:58,930
FRUSTRATION. 

824
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,630
>> I WANT TO BRING IN ED O'KEEFE

825
00:24:59,630 --> 00:24:59,764
. 

826
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:00,364
>> Reporter: HE'S OPERATING 

827
00:25:00,364 --> 00:25:00,998
FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH. 

828
00:25:00,998 --> 00:25:01,566
HE HAS TOTAL CONTROL OVER 

829
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:01,933
FOREIGN POLICY. 

830
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:02,633
THIS WAS A DECISION HE MADE ON 

831
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:02,900
HIS OWN. 

832
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,601
WITH EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN 

833
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:04,235
THIS PRESIDENCY IT CAME IN 

834
00:25:04,235 --> 00:25:04,669
DRAMATIC FASHION. 

835
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,269
THERE WAS A LETTER RELEASED 

836
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:05,937
THIS MORNING BY THE WHITE HOUSE 

837
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:06,571
THAT READS LIKE AN EMOTIONAL 

838
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:06,938
BREAKUP LETTER. 

839
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:07,572
IT HAS GLOBAL RAMIFICATIONS. 

840
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:08,206
IN ONE SENTENCE HE SAYS YOU 

841
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:08,740
TALK ABOUT YOUR NUCLEAR 

842
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,373
CAPABILITIES, BUT OURS ARE SO 

843
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:09,974
MASSIVE AND POWERFUL THAT I 

844
00:25:09,974 --> 00:25:10,608
PRAY TO GOD THEY WILL NEVER 

845
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:11,042
HAVE TO BE USED. 

846
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:11,709
IN THE NEXT SENTENCE, I FELT A 

847
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:12,376
WONDERFUL DIALOGUE WAS BUILDING 

848
00:25:12,376 --> 00:25:12,877
UP BETWEEN YOU AND ME. 

849
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:13,511
ULTIMATELY IT IS ONLY THAT 

850
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,045
DIALOGUE THAT MATTERS. 

851
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:14,612
SOMEDAY I LOOK FORWARD TO 

852
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:14,946
MEETING YOU. 

853
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:15,546
YOU CAN SEE THE YANG AND THE 

854
00:25:15,546 --> 00:25:15,880
YANG THERE. 

855
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,514
TRYING TO BE TOUGH BUT ALSO 

856
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,081
LEAVING OPEN THE DOOR TO 

857
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:17,682
POSSIBLY DOING THIS AGAIN. 

858
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,316
>> TODAY HE SAID THE SUMMIT 

859
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,016
MIGHT HAPPEN AT THE DAY OR AT A 

860
00:25:19,016 --> 00:25:19,350

REITERATING WHAT WAS IN THE

IN TERMS OF OUR MILITARY 

884
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:32,130
COMMITMENT. 

885
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:32,764
IF NORTH KOREA WAS TO PURSUE 

886
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:33,364
SOMETHING BEYOND DIPLOMACY. 

887
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:34,031
>> LET'S GO STRAIGHT TO MAJOR

>> Reporter: THAT IS RIGHT. 

903
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:42,406
THAT EMPHASIS IS IMPORTANT. 

904
00:25:42,406 --> 00:25:42,907
REMARKS LIKE THIS ARE 

905
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:43,407

WORLD COMMUNITY. 

908
00:25:44,475 --> 00:25:45,143
BY STARTING WITH I'VE TALKED TO 

909
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:45,743
THE JOINT STEVE -- CHIEF OF 

910
00:25:45,743 --> 00:25:46,444
STAFF IN THE MILITARY IS READY. 

911
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:47,111
WE HAVE TALKED TO OUR ALLIES 

912
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:47,678
IMMEDIATELY IN THE REGION. 

913
00:25:47,678 --> 00:25:48,179
THEY ARE READY TO PAY 

914
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:48,579
ASSOCIATED COST. 

915
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:49,247
SHOULD SOMETHING MILITARY HAVE 

916
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:49,680
TO BE UNDERTAKEN. 

917
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,314
ALL OF THAT AS A PRELUDE TO 

918
00:25:50,314 --> 00:25:50,948
SAYING IF THINGS GET BACK ON 

919
00:25:50,948 --> 00:25:51,616
TRACK A LOT OF PROMISING THINGS 

920
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:51,916
CAN HAPPEN. 

921
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:52,483
WHAT DOES THIS TELL US? 

922
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:53,117
THE THEORY OF THE CASE, THAT 

923
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:53,751
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S THEORY ABOUT 

924
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:54,352
DEALING WITH NORTH KOREA IS 

925
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:54,986
THAT THE SUMMIT WAS POSSIBLE 

926
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:55,620
BECAUSE HE WAS SO AGGRESSIVE 

927
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,287
AND THREATENING MILITARY ACTION 

928
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:56,888
AS DETERRENCE FOR THE NORTH 

929
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:57,455
KOREANS OBTAINING WHAT IT 

930
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:58,122
CLEARLY DOESN'T HAVE YET BUT IS 

931
00:25:58,122 --> 00:25:58,523
WORKING TOWARDS. 

932
00:25:58,523 --> 00:25:59,090
NOT ONLY A NUCLEAR WEAPONS 

933
00:25:59,090 --> 00:25:59,724
CAPABILITY WHICH IT POSSESSES 

934
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,258
BUT THE INTERCONTINENTAL 

935
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:00,858
BALLISTIC MISSILE TECHNOLOGY 

936
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:01,425
NECESSARY TO DELIVER IT. 

937
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:01,959
THAT IS SOMETHING THIS 

938
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:02,460
PRESIDENT HAS SAID IS 

939
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,094
UNACCEPTABLE AND WILL NOT BE 

940
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:03,728
TOLERATED IN MILITARY ACTION. 

941
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,328
IT WILL BE USED TO STOP. 

942
00:26:04,328 --> 00:26:04,996
THE CONVERSATION GOES BACK TO 

943
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:05,296
THAT NOW. 

944
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:05,963
WHERE WAS THREE OR FOUR MONTHS 

945
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:06,164
AGO. 

946
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:06,831
BEFORE PROSPECTS OF THE SUMMIT 

947
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:07,331
BEGAN TO TAKE SHAPE. 

948
00:26:07,331 --> 00:26:07,932
THEY TOOK SHAPE FIRST QUITE 

949
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:08,599
INFORMALLY WHEN VICE PRESIDENT 

950
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:09,233
PENCE WENT TO THE OLYMPIC -- 

951
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:09,500
OLYMPICS. 

952
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,001
SOME OF THAT INFORMAL. 

953
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:10,568
THE NORTH AND SOUTH KOREANS 

954
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:10,902
WERE THERE. 

955
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:11,569
LOTS OF THINGS WERE SUGGESTED 

956
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,003
MIGHT BE POSSIBLE. 

957
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:12,670
IT WAS THAT STEPPING OFF POINT 

958
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,304
THAT LED TO THE CONVERSATIONS 

959
00:26:13,304 --> 00:26:13,838
ABOUT A POSSIBLE SUMMIT. 

960
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:14,505
WHEN THE NORTH KOREANS INSULTED 

961
00:26:14,505 --> 00:26:15,072
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE 

962
00:26:15,072 --> 00:26:15,673
CALLING HIM A POLITICAL DUMMY 

963
00:26:15,673 --> 00:26:16,274
AND THREATENING A NUCLEAR WAR 

964
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:16,941
THEY CANNOT WAGE WITH UNITED 

965
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:17,575
STATES, THAT WAS EFFECTIVELY A 

966
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,242
RHETORICAL STRAW THAT BROKE THE 

967
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:18,576
CAMELS BACK. 

968
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,177
LOTS OF OTHER THINGS WERE 

969
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:19,811
SIGNALING THIS ADMINISTRATION. 

970
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:20,478
THINGS WERE GETTING OFF TRACK. 

971
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:21,179
IT WAS BETTER TO GET OUT OF THE 

972
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:21,846
SUMMIT AND CONTINUE TO PURSUE 

973
00:26:21,846 --> 00:00:00,000
SOMETHING UNLIKELY TO
