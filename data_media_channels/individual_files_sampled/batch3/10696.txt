with many people in Afghanistan demanding that US troops stationed there withdraw the Afghan President was warned that the country could collapse within six months without Washington's support Marty Samir Khan has more well America's longest war has been raging on for 16 years now it survived four different administrations yet there's been no change let's quickly go into some details well the number of US casualties in Afghanistan 2408 killed and the cost well over a trillion dollars has been spent on the military campaign and 117 billion dollars spent on reconstruction general Nicholson and President Ghani pretty much criticized the war in Afghanistan that it's lasted this long and the US has spent trillions of dollars but the country remains as dangerous and unstable as ever this is something that both general Nicholson and president Ghani agree on well general Nicholson spoke about suicide bombers carrying out attacks even in Kabul admitting that the Capitol is an easy target for suicide bombings the president said that the country is under siege saying that 21 different international terrorist groups are operating in Afghanistan which include suicide bombers attacks are being carried out in Kabul despite it being known as the safest city in Afghanistan who will not be able to support our army for six months without us support and u.s. capabilities it's also worth mentioning that on top of the problems both general Nicholson and president Ghani brought up the Taliban still control 40% of the country and in these 16 years of war the Taliban didn't really lose that much territory and in some regions they even strengthened their control so Afghanistan looks like a stalemate American troops are still there but they're unable to change the situation but if they leave everything will collapse so the US has dedicated so much money resources and troops to the cause but nothing seems to have worked and it doesn't look like there's going to be any change in policy either Middle East military analyst kamal alums as the crisis needs a regional solution but washington won't resort to that option because of its policies the majority of the country it's far worse than it was when the US and NATO came in so one could say 70% of the country which is rural it's it's definitely been a negative for them NATO I at their peak at 150,000 soldiers about five years ago and they couldn't turn the tide so militarily the US forces and NATO are far less now on the ground and they're up against it the Taliban are taking more territory there are more non-state actors like Isis involved as well so I think for the US it'll be very difficult to turn the tide big solution lies in working regionally at the moment the u.s. is not working too closely with China or Russia Iran or Pakistan Afghanistan needs a regional solution at the moment the US and NATO don't have any answers to it so the u.s. is isolated as far as the region goes at the same time the national unity government of Afghanistan has no unity there you've got the different ethnicities of Afghanistan had had each other's throats so it looks pretty grim there is no hope for Iraq and Syria then there is in Afghanistan for the
