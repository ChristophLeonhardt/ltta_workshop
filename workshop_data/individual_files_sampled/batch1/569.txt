it's been more than six months since there are skirts said they wanted to go their own way but was there referendum on independence a mistake I'm mayor Hassan also on the show last month China voted to remove presidential term limits allowing President Xi Jinping to effectively rule for life so what is the country's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong mean for China and for the world that's our debate but first more than six months after a referendum in favor of secession Iraqi Kurdistan is no closer to independence instead they've lost territory to Baghdad and may now lose seats in the upcoming Iraqi elections so is the Middle East ready for a new independent nation or has it all backfired for the Kurds this week's headliner the kurdistan regional governments representative to the US by an Samy Abdul Rahman beyond sami abdul-rahman thanks for joining me on upfront last September despite opposition from a lot of your allies from your neighbors from the Iraqi government the Kurdish regional government the KRG in Iraq went ahead and held an independence referendum in which more than 90 percent of those who voted supported your region going independent from the rest of Iraq but what was the point of that vote given you're not independent more than six months later and you know it you don't see any way closer to being independent more than six months later our intention was never to declare independence immediately we never and we still don't believe in a unilateral declaration of independence our intention was to allow the people of Kurdistan to voice or express their will for the first time ever and also to send a message to our neighbors to Baghdad to the international community that this is what people want we've believed that having a referendum would allow that to happen and then we would talk to Baghdad about our future relationship so we never envisaged that we would be independent by now six months after the referendum so when do you envisage being independently well the dream of independence will never be extinguished I think that's a fact that everybody has to live with but we're also pragmatists after the referendum there's been a collective punishment of our people our neighbors have reacted the United States and Europe were not helpful so we understand the realities that we live with right now we're focused on the Iraqi elections which are coming up in May and looking forward to the next phase after that but you didn't answer my question when is Independence going to happen it depends because it depends on our dialogue with Baghdad we want to separate the referendum said that we want to separate from the rest of Iraq that has to be a negotiated settlement but we're not in that phase right now we are in the wake of the referendum where the people of Kurdistan are being punished and we are just trying to manage their being punished you say you talk about collective punishment I'm sure the Iraqi government wouldn't agree with that assessment but let's take your word they're being punished isn't that a reflection of how you've failed your people because you held a referendum you made these promises they voted for it the result was what you wanted and now they're being punished so it backfired on you hasn't it I want to clarify one thing there has been a punishment of our people but very recently in the past several weeks our relationship with Baghdad has started to get better so I want to just put that out there with regards to whether we have failed our people I'll tell you something Matti I have heard so many foreign officials and even Iraqi officials say describe the referendum as the failed referendum the problem actually isn't that it was a failure the problem for everybody is that it was a great success seven out of ten voters eligible voters turned out nine out of those who voted voted yes if you keep success of the referendum is that it happened that's your definition of success one of the one of the definitions keep in mind that we're part of Iraq where we have had genocide repeatedly not once repeatedly against the people of Kurdistan most recently under Isis you're not suggesting the current Iraqi government is bent on genocide against your people no I'm not I'm talking about our history I mean nobody's questioning history we talk about right now yes but the decisions we make today and tomorrow are informed by our past for us we looked at Iraq as a place that is not a home a comfortable home for the Kurds 2003 came along it became clear the u.s. wanted to liberate her out intervene in Iraq we decided that we wanted to be part of this new Iraq because this could be the Iraq we had hopeful federal democratic pluralistic that didn't happen this is what led us to a referendum we have had to fight for our own survival in the survival of Iraq by fighting - or Isis we have taken care of 1.8 million displaced people in Syrian refugees we have had to deal with a crash in oil prices we have had to deal with Baghdad many would say dealing with crashing oil prices and refugees and it would be easier many would argue to deal with those problems that you have had to deal with ISIL oil price issues Syrian refugees if you were part of Iraq rather than on your own but we were part of Iraq in 2014 okay we were part of Iraq we hadn't had a referendum our budget is cut off a war is imposed on us genocide is committed against our people once again by the Iraqi government to be fair okay why did it happen because the Sunni Arab community in Iraq was completely disillusioned to some Isis looked like a better alternative I'm sure they regretted it eventually but at that moment again it was the failed policies of Baghdad what about your own allies in the West the US the UK stood with you for a long time and yet the US government says the vote and the result lacks legitimacy the UK government says your leadership behaved in a regrettable fashion the EU said it was a counterproductive move why do all of these Western allies of yours why they so upset with you how many independence movements has America supported how many independence movements has the u.s. view the u.s. in Kosovo okay name me others they were they were against Estonia Lithuania Latvia countries that today are part of the EU and and enjoy full rights so we expected those countries to be against our referendum what we didn't expect is the unsophisticated way in which they would go about it they didn't take into account that with every statement especially the United States but US and Europe with every statement they made against the referendum they were embolden announ Abers and baghdad to think that the Kurds were alone and that they could punish us we raised this issue with them we said we understand you're against it but they created it became a self-fulfilling you're a diplomat and you're telling me we didn't expect them to do this we didn't know Baghdad would punish us it looks like you guys walked into this completely unprepared and surely it backfired even on your own we didn't expect that the United States I'm asking maybe we should but we also have an obligation to our people I am a diplomat and we have very good relations today with the United States and our European friends but we also have an negation first and foremost to our people it is right that the people of Kurdistan should be able to express their wish we didn't commit a crime by having a referendum the right to self-determination is enshrined in the UN the same UN that all of these countries want us to look up to and abide by the rules of it is enshrined in the UN Charter the reason a lot of people are wary about independence as you know is because they look at what's going on there already you look at the two main political parties your own Kurdistan Democratic Party the KDP and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan the puk a lot of the critics of these two parties not just your party would say they fail to lay the groundwork for stable governance a stable political system a stable economy rule of law independent judiciary instead they've given your people a system plagued with corruption nepotism tribalism and that's why you know what maybe independence is not the right route for an area like that to have well I would say that the achievements of the Kurdistan region are significant if you look at where we were in 1991 when the no-fly zone was first established over Kurdistan in Iraq we had just come out of one and a half decades of genocide by Saddam Hussein four and a half thousand villages were destroyed Kurdistan was crushed economically politically militarily from 1991 to 2003 we had our ups and downs in a very dark period but we came out of it after 2003 to 2013 14 Kurdistan really flourished our economy boomed we created an oil industry from scratch all of the oil and gas wealth in Kurdistan had been neglected over decades for the first time we were able to export our own or exploit our own resources you could agree that you've made significant achievements since 1991 and since 2003 while also pointing out there's massive corruption there is I mean the Deputy Prime Minister the KRG who barred talabani said and I quote that there Pharaoh's in the KRG quote confiscating lands building villas doing business smuggling killing people and journalists and that the KRG has failed to stand up to these people who appear on television on a daily basis talking about corruption I think he was referring to a a person when he made this comment but you're wider point about corruption yes there is corruption could we have done better can we do better absolutely we can but let's also be realistic since 2014 Kurdistan has had shock after shock first our budget was cut second we've been engaged in a very costly war in terms of human lives and the finances that the the financial corruption predated the ISIL you came on this show in 2016 I remember you telling me then that we could do better on corruption we should demand nearly two years later it's getting worse not better there are hundreds of cases now according to the commission of integrity in the KRG being referred to courts being dealt with you have the Deputy Prime Minister talking about it in this very open way about Pharaoh's running the care but I think these I think the Deputy Prime Minister talking about it openly the integrity Commission having cases to deal with these all show that it's a subject we talk about that it's such a huge problem it's a subject that we're dealing with and we are dealing with it in very practical ways we have instigated a biometric system of registering all civil servants everybody who receives a government pension or allowance anybody who benefits from the government system they are registered so there is no room for ghost employees with regards to our oil industry we have hired Deloitte to audit all of our revenues and contracts going back retrospectively we are taking practical steps we are going to the Finance Ministry but I want to answer your point from you have repeatedly said there is corruption I don't deny there is corruption dealing with it but you can't deal with it if it's built into the system is my point you want to create an independent state but what's it built on you have a president of the KRG up until November Massoud Barzani who had to extend his term in office twice just to stay in power twelve years his son is currently head of the intelligence services his nephew is the Prime Minister Kurdish politics sounds like a family business I think you try to get away from the Arab family businesses you're doing your own family business Paula in the KRG that's that's the future of Kurdistan those people those parties that you talk about I talked about a family to be honest okay but let me that their families who lead political parties very democratic somebody those parties are elected by the public and the public knows who is the leader president Barzani is no longer president of the region he remains president of the Kurdistan Democratic Party when people vote and they will vote in the Kurdistan elections this year as well as the Iraqi elections people know who they're voting for if it is these parties or the KDP let's say my party is led by the Barzani's many people are proud of their record many people look up to them for leadership there are issues in our society naturally every political system which is dominated by nepotism and cronies that's the defense offered the people are happy with the rulers people vote they will have another opportunity to vote this year they've played for the head of the intelligence services no but they vote they vote for the party that will have the most secret number I know you hunts okay I know you have to go so one last question on the matter of Kurdish independence Joost Hill Terman who directs the Middle East and North Africa program at the International Crisis Group he said recently it's fine to want to be independent people have their right to self-determination so it's not an issue of right or wrong the question was did they the Kurds have the capacity and was the timing right clearly they didn't have the capacity and the timing was terrible looking back now doesn't he have a point surely you must concede that at least I'm glad that he recognizes the right to self-determination because a lot of international figures seem to forget that when it comes to Kurdistan we we are right to express our will in a referendum we haven't committed a crime we said from day one this is a referendum to hear the voice of the people we are not going to declare independence unilaterally that still remains the position today we are looking for Iraq that believes in the Constitution that everybody voted for in 2005 we believe that the Constitution is the way forward for us I believe if the Iraqi Constitution of 2005 had been implemented fully we may not have had a referee no regrets on the referendum whatsoever personally I have no regrets I voted yes and I would vote yes again and I believe there are many people that believe that man thank you so much for joining me on thank you he's promised a new era for China but critics of President Xi Jinping have compared him to Chairman Mao last month the Chinese parliament voted to remove presidential term limits giving Xi Jinping the right to remain in office indefinitely so what does one man would virtually unchecked power mean for the future of China and for the rest of the world joining me to debate this are Sharon Homme executive director of the NGO human rights in China and professor of law at New York University and from Beijing Qin doshu a political analyst at China Radio International and senior fellow at the Pango Institution thank you both for joining me in the arena Chindi let me start with you is Xi Jinping of some say of the new Mao one of his biographers says he's now emperor for life no it's different from the period that ran by Chairman more for one thing this is not at the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s so we are living in the 21st century with this 24/7 basically water war media coverage and also social media no government no one person can basically control the whole society no it's not the case and secondly I think a lot of people don't really understand you know what's going on within China especially with this removal of a thermal limit I think there is of course technical reasons they want to bring the term ins unified with the party secretary and also chairman of the Central Military Commission and also I think I would see this as part of the Chinese exploration to seek a model you know that's fit perfectly for the Chinese situation so that's part of efforts I don't think this is the end of the Chinese politics this is not the end of like the history protected at the end of the collapse of a former Soviet Union no it's not the end of that it's a process Sharon home what's your view is China heading into a new evil harsher era of strongman rule of one-man rule well I think it's China's gone backwards and I think China has gone back backwards at least 40 years in several respects one it's China has gone backwards because it's failing to learn the lesson of the Cultural Revolution and the lesson of the Cultural Revolution was to have all power concentrated in one liter that's unaccountable to the people truly accountable to the people will inevitably lead to mass suffering and abuses and that's one lesson the second is the difference between the Mao era one is China is part of a global economy secondly Chinese people today are not like the people that were closed off during the Cultural Revolution you've got almost 800 million online on the Internet and despite censorship despite legal controls restrictive controls propaganda controls the fact remains that you can't control 1.4 billion people's views jindo Sharon says there that one man responded here you can respond specifically I would like you to respond to the point she made about she didn't bring being one man unaccountable to the people and that leads to abuses if you look at the Chinese this is the changes to the Constitution and the Chinese government and what they have done since the concluding of the two sessions over there you see the tremendous changes that evolved like about 18 ministries or agencies about institutional reforms and also the national super bird supervisory commission this is super body for anti-corruption campaign all those efforts are actually a response to the public content or discontent about corruption and if you look at what China has achieved over the past couple of years in terms of treating the pollution issue you will see what China has achieved basically something in the two key Los Angeles and London decades to achieve 30% reduction of the pollution in this densely populated area like Beijing of Shanghai so that's the response from the government we are very responsible to the public so I would say you know China system is very different from the western-style but it is very responsive Sharon isn't that a fair point that we need to recognize the good things that China has done with this undemocratic model in terms of in terms of cleaning up the environment extreme poverty development would you concede that so there are three things to say about that first of all no one contests that millions of people have been lifted out of poverty and that China is leading and doing very important in technology green technology and in dealing with the pollution problem but the third thing is is that growing inequality in China is a fact and that the economy is slowing down and that's going to exacerbate the problem the issue is not whether China Western model Chinese model I really want to emphasize that every system including the US has problems and so the issue is not whether one system is better than another the question is whether the people who are the most directly affected by the policies and by the choices of the leaders have a voice and that's what's key and in China it is a hostile restrictive environment for any voice that is critical of Xi Jinping or of the party isn't Sharon correct there that there you cannot criticize he is he's in a sense a supreme leader the Chinese model was supposed to be about consensus the party you know elites coming together a meritocracy that was what we were told even by Chinese standards this is a pretty radical move one-man rule it is a radical change let's say and if you look at his re-election that's by unanimously the delegates about 3,000 of them unanimously elected mr. C to continue they really have a choice of course you can drop your vote or you can vote against that because nobody's the opponent in a gang at your head to force you to do something no and also if you look at the the polls 84% of the Chinese respondents thinks you know their government they have trust in their government and the six 8% of them went coming to the government of leadership think the Chinese government will lead them to a better future before we run out of time let me ask you this about bringing it back to the the president of China Xi Jinping broke with tradition last October by not naming a successor at the Communist Party's National Congress now clearly you're a supporter of is you think indefinite rule is not a problem but surely Chinese politicians must be wondering what comes next he's not a young man is there an air we don't know basically what we're happening say 10 years from now 50 years from here is basically this issue what we know what we know is like stability and continuity of Chinese development rapid development 6.5 percent that's for almost for sure for next year for the next five years or three years that's the predictability that's a stability Chinese people are welcoming okay Sharon well I want to say that President Xi Jinping has actually indicated quite publicly and repeatedly that he does have ambitions and he does feel he is a global leader and he does feel that China should be a global leader and it's reflected in the party work report it's reflected in the next five years plan so Xi Jinping thought with absolute leadership of the party and with the role of the party domestically and the role of China internationally is encapsulated in official policy given everyone agrees that China has opened up economically made progress economically on this president's watch on this president who's making radical changes as Jindo conceded are we going to see political opening up as well are we going to see more quote/unquote liberal moves more democratic moves Shindo than Sheren know you know because a lot of people who the look at China with the background to the cultural background the Western cultural background and the Western tradition people tend to use the Western rules basically Western rulers to measure the Chinese development say whether China is a democracy or whether China have these checks and balances or whether China doesn't to this model or not no China will never be like the US will never be in democracy and developing and doing very well at poverty reduction yes we have our own challenges we have our own models so I would say please respect the challenging development you know China has been successful Chinese people are happy and the people say hey you are different from us that you are calm this country so you must be bad this is crazy Sharon so I think it's very important that when we say that when we say the Chinese people I really don't think not even that you can say 1.3 billion people believe what mr. she just said or what Xi Jinping says they should believe if you think about the rights defense lawyers the human rights defenders if you talk to Tibetans and we Gers if you talk to intellectuals if you talk to the all the thousands of signers of charter 8lu shall bow if you think about Xu Zhu young and countless of Chinese citizens who demanded reforms and political reforms the 78 democracy wall the 89 tenement democracy movement these are Chinese people Chinese women feminists who are organizing peacefully around domestic violence issues and discrimination against women these are all issues that Chinese society faces and Chinese people have something to say about it and they have a voice and it's not monolithic and we have to help create the space that enables them to decide what kind of future and what kind of present they want we'll have to leave it there Sheringham jindo xu thank you both for joining me in the arena that's our show up front we'll be back next week you
