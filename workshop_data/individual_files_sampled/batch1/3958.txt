I try and work out at least three times a week in cardio work the bitch press work on the biceps inverted sit-ups he sets a pull-up Tom body began in prison I went in and doctors told me that I could die because of my health issues I began moving as soon as they told me that in my prison cell way I understand it is we're going into a jail cell of some sort I'm excited let's do this you'll see like your body getting more leaner you know cut up more instead of just like being like your boy I guess halfway through I start to feel like I was going to throw up you know I started to fade fast I came into the class not really knowing what to expect at all and then just the intensity continued to ramp up and up and my brain was telling my body you're not ready for this once you try it and push yourself you can do more than what you think you can do my normal workout is a joke it's just this is like what you need to be doing if you want to say you're actually in shape you
