WITH CUSTOMS OFFICIALS AND 
PRAISING THEM FOR THEIR HARD 
WORK AND ALSO MEETING WITH SOME 
OF THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE 
ALREADY OR AT LEAST FOLKS THAT 
HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR 
FAMILIES THAT MAY POSSIBLILY BE 
REUNITED. 
SO I DON'T KNOW CAN WE HEAR 
WHAT'S HAPPENING? 
LET'S SEE IF THERE IS SOUND. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAD TALKED 
ABOUT THE FACT THAT HIS WIFE 
HAD SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUT THE 
SEPARATION OF FAMILIES, HIS 
DAUGHTER IVANKA HAD SPOKE TO 
HIM ABOUT THE SEPARATION OF 
FAMILIES AND EXPRESSED THEIR 
DISMAY, DISAPPOINTMENT AND 
FRUSTRATION SEEING THAT HAPPEN 
AT THE BORDER. 
WHO KNOWS IF THAT HAD AN 
INFLUENCE OR LED HIM TO SIGN 
THE EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT IT WAS 
THE FIRST LADY-- 
>> THERE SHE IS. 
>> WE CAN SEE HER RIGHT NOW. 
HE DID SAY WHEN HE WAS SIGNING 
THE BILL THE FIRST LADY AS WELL 
AS HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA TRUMP 
DID NOT LIKE IT. 
THE FIRST LADY SHOULD BE 
COMMENDED FOR VISITING AND 
SEEING WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE 
FAMILIES WITH HER OWN EYES. 
IVANKA TRUMP IS A DIFFERENT 
STORY. 
SHE'S A SENIOR ADVISOR TO THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
AND SHE TWEETED IN SUPPORT OF 
HIS DECISION YESTERDAY TO SIGN 
THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WOULD 
PREVENT FAMILIES FROM BEING 
SEPARATED BUT THE ANALYSIS WAS 
AS A SENIOR ADVISOR WHY DIDN'T 
YOU ADVISE THE PRESIDENT TO 
PERHAPS NOT EVEN UNDER TAKE 
THIS POLICY THAT MANY ARE 
CALLING INHUMANE AND BARBARIC 
INCLUDING RELIGIOUS LEADERS ON 
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. 
>> THIS IS INTERESTING 
ACCORDING TO SOME OF OUR 
REPORTING THIS TRIP WAS MELANIA 
TRUMP, THE FIRST LADY'S IDEA 
AND SHE WANTED TO SEE 
EVERYTHING FOR HERSELF. 
THE CHILDREN ARE AN IMPORTANT 
PART OF HER PLATFORM AND SHE 
SUPPORTS FAMILY REUNIFICATION 
AND SHE WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW 
SHE CAN HELP. 
SHE FEELS THE EXECUTIVE ORDER 
YESTERDAY PAVEED THE WAY 
FORWARD BUT THERE IS STILL MORE 
TO BE DONE AND SHE WANTS TO 
LEND HER SUPPORT. 
IT ACTUALLY ECHOS A LOT OF WHAT 
WE HEARD THE MAYOR SAY EARLIER 
TODAY WHEN WE HAD THE GROUP OF 
MAYORS COMMENDING THE PRESIDENT 
FOR SIGNING THAT EXECUTIVE 
ORDER BUT SAYING THAT'S JUST 
THE BEGINNING. 
>> FOR SURE. 
AND LOOK, THE INTERESTING 
SITUATION HERE IS IT WILL BE 
GREAT FOR VIEWERS TO SEE THESE 
CHILDREN BECAUSE APPARENTLY 
SOME OF THE CHILDREN THAT ARE 
THERE ARE CHILDREN THAT HAVE 
BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR 
FAMILIES. 
THE QUESTION WILL BE WHY ISN'T 
THE PRESS ALLOWED INTO SOME OF 
THESE FACILITIES? 
WHY HAVEN'T WE BEEN GIVEN THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE NOT FROM THE 
GOVERNMENT AND WHAT THEY WANT 
US TO SEE BUT FROM THE PRESS' 
OWN EYES, THEIR OWN RECORDING 
TWICES WHETHER THEY BE CAMERAS 
OR RECORDING DEVICES OR VIDEO 
CAMERAS, THAT HASN'T HAPPENED 
YET SO SHE SHOULD BE COMMENDED 
FOR GOING THERE AND SEEING WHAT 
IT IS LIKE BUT THERE ARE A LOT 
OF QUESTIONS THAT STILL NEED TO 
BE ANSWERED. 
>> THE FIRST LADY HERSELF AN 
IMMIGRANT AND THE PRESIDENT AND 
ADMINISTRATION NOT HAVING A 
QUESTION ABOUT HOW SHE GOT 
HERE, WHAT VISAS AND WHETHER OR 
NOT SHE--PARTICULARLY REMEMBER 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS 
CAMPAIGNING THERE WERE A LOT OF 
QUESTIONS ABOUT NOT ONLY HOW 
SHE GOT HERE BUT HOW HER 
PARENTS GOT HERE. 
RIGHT? 
WAS IT THROUGH THAT FAMILIAL OR 
THE REPUBLICANS CALL IT CHAIN 
MIGRATION? 
>> YEAH. 
>> LOOKS LIKE MAYBE WE CAN 
LISTEN IN NOW BECAUSE SHE SEEMS 
TO BE SORT OF GREETING PEOPLE. 
>> GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY. 
MY NAME IS KURT AND IT'S A 
PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO SERVE AS 
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF 
UP BRING, UP BRING IS A 136-
YEAR-OLD FAITH INSPIRED 
ORGANIZATION AND OUR MISSION 
HERE IN THE STATE OF TEXAS AND 
LOUISIANA IS TO BREAK THE CYCLE 
OF CHILD ABUSE BY EMPOWERING 
CHILDREN, FAMILIES AND 
COMMUNITIES. 
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART 
OF OUR MISSION AND SIMILAR TO 
SOME OF THE CHILDREN THAT WE 
CARE FOR AT OUR RESIDENTIAL 
TREATMENT CENTER, OUR FOSTER 
HOMES WHO MAY HAVE BEEN REMOVED 
FOR OPIOID ADDICTION, THESE 
CHILDREN ALSO COME FROM A VERY 
DIFFICULT JOURNEY. 
AND OUR STAFF HERE ARE 
COMMITTED TO PRAYING FOR THEM, 
PROVIDING THEM WITH CASE 
MANAGEMENT SERVICES, COMMITTED 
TO EDUCATION, PROVIDING 
EVERYTHING A CHILD NEEDS IN 
ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL. 
ONE OF THE WHAT WE'VE 
EXPERIENCED, MRS. TRUMP, IS 
THAT THE EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES 
THAT FOR ANY CHILD TO BE 
SUCCESSFUL WHETHER IT BE YOUR 
CHILD, MY CHILD, A CHILD IN 
TEXAS OR A CHILD HERE WE NEED 
TO SURROUND THEM WHAT WE CALL 
THE FIVE MARKERS OF SUCCESS SO 
THAT SAFETY, SAFETY'S FIRST 
LIFE SKILLS, HEALTH AND HEALTH 
WOULD BE EMOTIONAL HEALTH, 
TRAUMA INFORMED CARE, SPIRITUAL 
HEALTH AS WELL AS PHYSICAL 
HEALTH. 
EDUCATION YOU'LL SEE AT OUR 
CHARTER SCHOOL LATER AND THEN 
LOCATION SO EVERY CHILD HAS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE OUT HIS AND 
HER CALL. 
WE ARE HONORED TO SHOW YOU OUR 
SHELTER. 
IT'S A SHELTER THAT CURRENTLY 
CARES FOR 58 CHILDREN. 
CHILDREN WHO COME FROM VERY 
DIFFICULT JOURNEYS AND WE TREAT 
THEM LIKE OUR OWN CHILDREN. 
SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TO ALLOW 
THE SECRETARY OF COURSE TO SAY 
A FEW WORDS AND TO INTRODUCE 
OUR SPECIAL GUEST. 
>> DR. SEN SK I AND AS PROGRAM 
DIRECTOR HERE AND TO ALL OF YOU 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WELCOMING 
US HERE. 
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW HOW 
VERY GRATEFUL WE ARE T THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN 
SERVICES THE WORK THAT UP BRING 
DOES FOR THESE CHILDREN AND WE 
ARE DELIGHTED TO HEAR MORE 
ABOUT IT AND HEAR MORE ABOUT 
THE SENSE OF PASSION AND 
MISSION AND WHAT YOU DO. 
WE ARE PRIVILEGED TO BE WITH 
YOU AND I'M DELIGHTED THAT THE 
FIRST LADY IS SPENDING TODAY 
ABOUT US AND WE ARE GOING TO 
GET TO MEET YOUR CHILDREN AND 
MEET YOU AND HEAR FROM YOU SO 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MRS. 
TRUMP, I TURN IT OVER TO YOU. 
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING 
ME HERE TODAY. 
I'M GLAD I'M HERE AND I'M 
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING AND 
MEETING THESE CHILDREN BUT 
FIRST OF ALL LET ME BEGIN TO 
RECOGNIZE EACH OF YOU AND 
THANKING YOU FOR ALL OF WHAT 
YOU DO FOR YOUR HEROING WORK 
THAT YOU DO EVERY DAY AND WHAT 
YOU DO FOR THOSE CHILDREN. 
WE ALL KNOW THEY ARE HAVING-
-THEY ARE HERE WITHOUT THEIR 
FAMILIES. 
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR HARD WORK, YOUR COMPASSION 
AND YOUR KINDNESS IN THESE 
DIFFICULT TIMES. 
I'M HERE TO LEARN ABOUT YOUR 
FACILITY AND TO WHICH I KNOW 
YOU HOUSED CHILDREN ON A LONG 
TERM BASIS. 
AND I ALSO LIKE TO ASK YOU HOW 
I CAN HELP TO THESE CHILDREN TO 
REUNITE THEM WITH THEIR 
FAMILIES AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE. 
SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALL OF 
WHAT YOU DO AND THANK YOU AS 
WELL. 
THANK YOU ALL FOR WHAT YOU DO. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
AND YOU CAN SAY A FEW WORDS. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. 
WHAT WE'LL DO NOW IS EVERYONE 
AROUND THE TABLE HERE CAN 
INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AND GIVE A 
BRIEF ROLE OF WHAT IT IS THAT 
YA'LL DO WITHIN YOUR AGENCIES. 
START WITH YOU. 
>> RYAN HARRISON, THE DEPUTY 
CHIEF OF STAFF FOR THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN 
SERVICES. 
>> I'M MANUAL JUNIOR, THE CHIEF 
PATROL AGENT FOR THE U.S. 
BORDER PATROL AND OUR ROLE IS 
WE'RE THE FIRST TO ENCOUNTER 
MANY OF THE UNACCOMPANIED 
CHILDREN THAT COME INTO OUR 
COUNTRY. 
>> GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS 
MAGGIE WINNE I'M A COUNSELOR TO 
SECRETARY AZAR AND I WORK WITH 
A PROGRAM THAT FUNDS SHELTERS 
LIKE UP BRING HERE. 
>> GOOD MORNING WE PROVIDE 
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND 
SUPPORT WHILE THEY'RE IN THEIR 
JOURNEY. 
>> I'M THE LEAD CASE MANAGER 
HERE. 
MY ROLE HERE IS IN 
REUNIFICATION. 
>> MY NAME IS AND I'M THE 
SHELTER UNIT MANAGER AND I TAKE 
CARE OF THE EVERY DAY 
OPERATIONS ARE THE CHILDREN. 
>> GOOD MORNING. 
I'M THE MEDICAL CARE 
COORDINATOR FOR UP BRING HERE 
AND WE DO THE HEALTH SCREENING 
FOR EACH UNIQUE HEALTH OF 
CHILDREN. 
>> HELLO, GOOD MORNING. 
MY NAME IS GONZALEZ I'M THE 
LEAD TEACHER AID. 
I MAKE SURE THE KIDS GET THE 
BEST EDUCATION WE CAN GIVE THEM 
SO THEY CAN HAVE A SUCCESSFUL 
LIFE. 
>> HELLO, GOOD MORNING. 
MY NAME IS AND I'M WITH HHSOR. 
I WORK WITH A PROGRAM IN REVIEW 
REVIEWING THE CASES OF THE 
CHILDREN WHO WILL BE REHOMED. 
>> MY NAME IS GONZALEZ AND I'M 
THE FIELD SUPERVISOR OF THE 
DIVISION OF UNACCOMPANIED 
CHILDREN. 
>> NICE TO MEET YOU. 
I HEARD YOU HAVE 58 CHILDREN? 
>> WE HAVE 55. 
>> 55, OH. 
>> WE ARE SURE OF THAT NUMBER. 
>> OH GREAT SO THREE OF THEM 
WERE REUNITED WITH THEIR 
FAMILIES? 
>> AT THIS POINT. 
>> THOSE CHILDREN, HOW MANY 
TIMES HAVE THEY SPOKE WITH 
THEIR RELATIVES, FAMILIES PER 
WEEK FOR EXAMPLE? 
>> THE CHILDREN ARE ALLOWED TO 
COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR FAMILY 
DEVICE A--TWICE A WEEK. 
THEY GET A TEN MINUTE PHONE 
CALL. 
FIRST THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE 
THE PERSON THEY ARE CONTACTING 
ARE THEIR FAMILIES SO WE HAVE 
TO FOLLOW THE PROCESS OF 
POLICIES AND REGULATIONS TO 
MAKE SURE THEY POSITIVELY 
IDENTIFY THAT THE PERSONS THAT 
THEY ARE COMMUNICATING WITH ARE 
INDEED THEIR FAMILY AND THAT 
COULD LEAD TO VERIFICATION OF 
BIRTH CERTIFICATES, PHOTO 
IDENTIFICATION BUT THEY DO 
COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR 
FAMILIES. 
>> SO WHEN THE CHILDREN COME 
HERE, WHAT KIND OF STATE, 
PHYSICAL AND MENTAL STATE, DO 
THEY COME HERE? 
WHAT DO YOU SAY THE PERCENTAGE 
THEY COME HERE? 
>> WELL,-- 
>> SO USUALLY THE GREAT 
MAJORITY ARE GUATEMALAN. 
IT'S A HIGHER PERCENTAGE RATE. 
THEY ARE DISTRAUGHT AND DON'T 
KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AT. 
THEY ARE THINKING THEY ARE 
GOING TO CONTINUE IN THE 
PROCESS OF PROCESSING THEM AND 
WHEN THEY SEE THE ENVIRONMENT 
AND THEY SEE THE OTHER KIDS AND 
THEY SEE THE YARD THEY START 
RELAXING SO THE FIRST 24 HOURS 
ARE CRUCIAL FOR US MAKING SURE 
THAT WE GOT THEM THE BASIC 
NEEDS, SHOWERS, CLOTHING, FOOD 
AND BEFORE WE EVEN START DSS. 
WITHIN THOSE 24 HOURS OUR UNIT 
SHELTER MANAGER IS IN CHARGE OF 
DOING A BRIEF UPDATE AS TO 
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEM THAT 
WAY WE CAN ADDRESS IT 
IMMEDIATELY AND THAT EVENTUALLY 
EVERY DEPARTMENT TAKES A TURN 
TO BE ABLE TO FURTHER ASSESS 
THE NEEDS OF THE KIDS. 
SO IT'S A PROCESS. 
>> YES. 
>> THE CHILDREN ARE VERY HAPPY. 
THEY LOVE TO STUDY. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
>> THEY LOVE TO GO TO SCHOOL. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
WHEN THE CHILDREN FIRST GET 
HERE, IT IS A PROCESS. 
THEY GO THROUGH AN ORIENTATION, 
THEY GO THROUGH A 24 HOUR 
INITIAL ORIENTATION WHERE WE 
GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS WE 
POSSIBLY CAN FROM THE CHILDREN 
AGAIN TO ASSESS AND MAKE SURE 
THAT WE ARE NOT MISSING 
ANYTHING. 
IF THERE'S AN IMMEDIATE MEDICAL 
NEED THAT IS IMMEDIATELY 
ADDRESSED. 
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR ANY 
SEVERE WE BRING IN OUR 
PHYSICIANS AND AFTER THEY DO AN 
ORIENTATION THEY GO THROUGH 
SEVERAL ORIENTATIONS. 
THEY GO THROUGH THE SHELTER. 
THEY GO THROUGH CASE MANAGEMENT 
ORIENTATION AND ALSO GO THROUGH 
CLINICAL ORIENTATION. 
SO THEY WILL GET A 
UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR CURRENT 
PLACEMENT AND AGAIN THIS IS TO 
INFORM THEM AND KEEP THEM AS 
CALM AS POSSIBLE AND TO 
REASSURE THEM THAT THEY ARE 
INNOCENT. 
THEY WILL BE WELL TAKEN CARE OF 
HERE. 
THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO 
WORRY ABOUT. 
NOW THEY ARE IN A SAFE 
ENVIRONMENT, FREE FROM ABUSE. 
AND EVERY DAY YOU HAVE 
SOMETHING NEW WITH THE 
CHILDREN. 
WE'VE PROVIDED A LOT OF 
STRUCTURE HERE. 
DURING THE MONDAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY SCHEDULE, THEY DO ATTEND 
CLASS. 
AND WE TRY TO EDUCATE THEM. 
WE TRY TO WHAT THE PUBLIC 
SCHOOL EDUCATION SYSTEM IS 
GOING TO BE LIKE. 
AND THEN WE ALSO INTEGRATE 
RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES, 
SPIRITUAL CARE FOR THE 
CHILDREN, DOWN TIME FOR THEM. 
IT'S JUST NORMAL. 
YOU KNOW? 
THEY REFER TO THESE AS SHELTERS 
BUT IT IS REALLY A HOME FOR THE 
CHILDREN. 
THIS IS THEIR HOUSE. 
SO THEIR BEDROOMS ARE THEIR 
BEDROOMS AND AS YOU WILL SEE 
THE CHILDREN AND SEE THE SMILES 
ON THEIR FACES AND YOU'LL HEAR 
THEM GIGGLE. 
IT'S JUST FANTASTIC. 
THE STAFF THAT WE HAVE HERE, WE 
JUST HAVE A TREMENDOUS PASSION 
FOR WORKING WITH THESE CHILDREN 
AND WE SEE THEM AS IF THEY WERE 
OUR OWN. 
AGAIN, WE DO MAINTAIN 
BOUNDARIES AND WE DO HAVE THE 
POLICIES AND GUIDELINES. 
BUT AGAIN, JUST THE PASSION 
THAT IS THERE IN WORKING WITH 
THESE CHILDREN ENSURING THAT 
THEY ARE SAFE AND ULTIMATELY 
REUNIFYING THEM WITH THEIR 
FAMILIES. 
>> HOW LONG IS THE TIME THAT-
-THE MAX TIME THAT SOMEBODY IS 
SENT HERE THAT THEY WOULD BE 
REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILY? 
>> RIGHT NOW WE ARE AVERAGING 
CURRENTLY 42 TO 45 DAYS. 
>> OH OKAY. 
>> SO IT'S NOT AN EXTENDED STAY 
AND WE ARE ALWAYS FOLLOWING THE 
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AS FAR 
AS REUNIFICATIONS ARE CONCERNED 
WITH THE CHILDREN. 
BUT THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY 
IS USUALLY 42 TO 45 DAYS. 
>> THAT'S GREAT. 
>> THERE IS SOME OCCASIONS 
WHERE SOME CHILDREN DO NOT HAVE 
ANYBODY TO GO BACK TO. 
AND THEN THOSE SITUATIONS, THEY 
ARE FURTHER ASSESSED BY THE 
LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDER THAT CAN 
HELP IDENTIFY IF THEY QUALIFY 
FOR SOME TYPE OF LEGAL RELIEF 
AND EVENTUALLY SOME CHILDREN 
WILL MOVE ONTO REFUGEE STATUS 
AND NOT UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN. 
AND AGAIN IT'S FEW AND FAR 
BETWEEN BUT WE DO HAVE THAT 
PROCESS WHERE SOME CHILDREN DO 
NOT HAVE ANYBODY TO GO TO WHOSE 
FAMILIES HAVE BEEN KILLED, 
MURDERED AND JUST DIFFERENT 
VERY TRAGIC SITUATIONS AND 
HOPEFULLY WE GET TO SPEAK TO A 
COUPLE OF CHILDREN TODAY AND 
YOU'LL SEE THAT. 
THERE'S NOT HOPE FOR THEM TO GO 
BACK TO A COUNTRY THAT THEY'RE 
LEAVING. 
SO WE GET FROM WE HAVE KIDS 
THAT COME INTO CUSTODY AND ARE 
REUNIFIED RATHER QUICKLY IF 
EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER AND THEN 
WE HAVE SOME CHILDREN THAT WILL 
UNFORTUNATELY AND FORTUNATELY 
STAY WITHIN THE SYSTEM FOR A 
NUMBER OF YEARS UNTIL THEY CAN 
QUALIFY FOR REFUGEE STATUS AND 
MOVE ON TO THE OTHER SISTER 
PROGRAM WHICH IS THE 
UNACCOMPANIED MINOR PROGRAM. 
>> THESE CHILDREN COME ALONE 
WITHOUT PARENTS? 
>> THE MAJORITY OF OUR 
CHILDREN, YES, MA'AM, THEY ARE 
UNACCOMPANIED AND DETAINED BY 
DHS AND BORDER PATROL FOR THE 
MAJORITY AND THAT'S A BIG PART 
OF WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE WORK 
WITH, YES, MA'AM. 
>> BECAUSE THEY ARE BETWEEN 12 
AND 17 YEARS OLD, RIGHT? 
>> YES. 
>> SO THEY KIND OF UNDERSTAND 
AND THEY KNOW. 
>> YES. 
>> WHERE THEY ARE. 
>> YES, MA'AM. 
>> SO THEY'RE NOT YOUNG, YOUNG 
CHILDREN. 
>> YES, MA'AM, THAT'S CORRECT. 
>> DO YOU HAVE THE CAPABILITY 
TO TAKE CARE OF YOUNGER 
CHILDREN HERE, YOUNGER THAN 12? 
>> OUR STATE LICENSE DOES ALLOW 
US TO TAKE CHILDREN UP UNTIL AS 
YOUNG AS SIX BUT FOR THE 
CURRENT CENSUS RIGHT NOW, ORR 
HAS ASKED US TO STAY WITHIN THE 
12 TO 17 RANGE. 
>> AND MR. SECRETARY OFTEN 
TIMES WILL PLACE YOUNGER 
CHILDREN IN OUR FOSTER. 
>> CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT PROCESS 
OF HOW YOU DO THAT? 
>> SURE. 
SO AT THE TIME OF DETENTION OR 
APPREHENSION WE WORK VERY 
CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS OVER 
AT HOMELAND SECURITY AND THEY 
IDENTIFY YOUNG CHILDREN FROM 
ZERO TO 5 YEARS OLD AND WE HAVE 
A SERIES OF NETWORK OF FOSTER 
HOMES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED 
STATES THAT ARE LICENSED IN 
THAT PARTICULAR STATE TO WORK 
WITH CHILDREN FROM ZERO TO 5 
YEARS OLD. 
AND IT'S A FAMILY SETTING THAT 
THESE KIDS WORK IN AND AGAIN 
THE SAME STANDARD APPLIES WHEN 
YOU ASSESS THEM FOR ANY MEDICAL 
NEED OR ANY SERIOUS 
COMPLICATION WHERE WE MAY HAVE 
TO USE DOCTORS, HOSPITALS IN 
THAT SITUATION BECAUSE WE GET 
EVERY TYPE OF CHILD IN OUR 
CUSTODY, SOMEBODY WHO IS NON 
MOBILE, NON-VERBAL TO SOMEBODY 
WHOSE MOM MAY HAVE PARISHED IN 
THE RIO GRANDE HERE IN SOUTH 
TEXAS. 
SO THOSE KIND OF KIDS ARE TAKEN 
CARE OF VERY SPECIAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY ARE 
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES 
ALSO. 
>> AND WE AS UP BRING HAVE 
SECURE PROGRAMS IN CORPUS 
CHRISTI AS WELL AS EL PASO AND 
AS OF TODAY ARE CURRENTLY 
SERVING AROUND 100 CHILDREN. 
>> GREAT. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING 
THE CHILDREN AND TOURING THE 
FACILITIES. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN FOR 
ALL OF WHAT YOU DO. 
THANK YOU. 
>> WHAT WE'LL DO NOW IS WE'LL 
WAIT HERE. 
>>>  ALL RIGHT, SO YEAH, THE 
FIRST LADY. 
>> VISITING A--SORRY VLAD-
-VISITING A FACILITY IN WHERE 
THEY ARE HOUSING ABOUT 55 YOUNG 
PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGES WE'VE 
LEARNED OF 12 AND 17. 
AND ACCORDING TO SOME OF OUR 
REPORTING THIS WAS THE FIRST 
LADY'S IDEA. 
SHE WANTED TO SEE THESE 
FACILITIES AND SEE THE CHILDREN 
THAT WERE BEING HELD HERE. 
ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE HERE 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE 
CHILDREN CROSSED THE BORDER ON 
THEIR OWN SO THERE ARE NO 
FAMILIES FOR THEM TO GO BACK 
TO. 
>> IT'S INTERESTING THE FIRST 
LADY IS ABLE TO TOUR THE 
FACILITY WHERE JOURNALISTS ARE 
NOT BEING GIVEN THE SAME LEVEL 
OF ACCESS TO THESE FACILITIES 
NOT JUST THIS ONE BUT OTHERS WE 
ARE LEARNING EVEN HERE IN NEW 
YORK CITY HOUSING SOME OF THESE 
CHILDREN. 
THESE ARE 12 YEARS OLD. 
>> 12 TO 17. 
>> IT'S A MUCH DIFFERENT 
SCENARIO FOR KIDS WHO ARE MUCH 
YOUNGER, BABIES, TODDLERS, 
GIRLS. 
WE HAVEN'T SEEN IMAGES OF THAT. 
HERE'S THE THING, THIS IS--WHEN 
WE TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING 
TO THESE CHIRP, THIS IS THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WE 
ARE NOT GOING TO PUT CHILDREN 
IN TERRIBLE CONDITIONS. 
THAT'S NOT THE POINT THAT 
PEOPLE ARE MAKING. 
THE POINT PEOPLE ARE MAKING IS 
THAT RIPPING A CHILD FROM THEIR 
PARENTS DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S 
A SUMMER CAMP THAT SOME HAVE 
CALLED IT OR ANYTHING ELSE, 
IT'S A TERRIBLE THING TO DO TO 
REMOVE A CHILD FROM THE ARMS OF 
ITS PARENTS. 
>> BUT I THINK IT'S SORT OF 
SIGNIFICANT, VLAD, THAT--AND 
IT'S GOOD THE FIRST LADY IS 
DOWN HERE BUT THEY MADE IT 
CLEAR THAT MOST OF THESE 
CHILDREN WERE NOT RIPPED FROM 
THE ARMS OF THEIR PARENTS. 
SHE'S NOT IN ONE OF THOSE 
FACILITIES JUST LIKE YOU SAID 
SHE'S NOT IN A FACILITY WITH A 
TODDLER OR A BABY. 
RIGHT? 
SO THIS IS SOMETHING VERY 
SPECIFIC BUT EVEN SAYING THAT, 
I MEAN, THE PEOPLE--ONE OF THE 
WOMEN THAT WAS THERE THE FIRST 
LADY ASKED ABOUT THE MENTAL 
STATE OF THESE CHILDREN AND ONE 
OF THE LADIES THERE SAID THEY 
OFTEN WHEN THEY COME HERE THINK 
THEY ARE JUST CONTINUING THE 
PATHWAY OF BEING PROCESSED. 
AND THEN ONCE THEY SEE THAT 
THERE ARE BEDS AND A YARD THEY 
REALIZE THAT NO, THIS IS GOING 
TO BE THEIR NEW HOME AT LEAST 
FOR ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE 
HERE THE NEXT 45 DAYS OR SO. 
>> RIGHT, THAT'S THE AVERAGE 
THEY HOLD THEM. 
SO LOOK, AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING 
IT'S A GOOD THING THE FIRST 
LADY IS THERE TO SEE EXACTLY 
WHAT IS HAPPENING AT LEAST IN 
THIS SPECIFIC AREA, THE 
SPECIFIC DETENTION CENTER AND 
CLEARLY SHOWS SOMETHING THE 
PRESIDENT HIMSELF SAID 
YESTERDAY THAT MELANIA THE 
FIRST LADY AS IVANKA TRUMP 
DIDN'T LIKE SEEING THE IMAGES 
THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD WAS 
 
SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR. 
AND SO SHE WANTS TO SEE FOR 
HERSELF AND SO IT'S SOMETHING 
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE I THINK 
ARE GOING TO BE COMMENDING HER 
FOR. 
WE'LL SEE WHAT SHE COMES BACK 
WITH WHAT SHE SAYS ABOUT HER 
EXPERIENCES THERE. 
AND WHAT SHE LEARNED AND THE 
THINGS THAT SHE HOPES WILL 
HOPEFULLY CHANGE. 
>> AND YOU KNOW, SHE TWEETED 
OUT THAT SHE DID NOT LIKE TO 
SEE THE SEPARATION OF FAMILIES 
AND ALL OF THE OTHER LIVING 
FORMER FIRST LADIES EXPRESSED 
THEIR CONCERN ABOUT THIS POLICY 
INCLUDING BARBARA BUSH. 
SHE WROTE AN OP ED FOR THE 
WASHINGTON POST AND IN IT SHE 
TALKED ABOUT HER MOTHER-IN-LAW 
BARBARA BUSH WHEN BARBARA BUSH 
WENT TO GO SEE THE BABIES WHO 
WERE INFECTED WITH H.I.V. 
AND AIDS AND HOW THAT 
TRANSFORMED THE PUBLIC'S 
OPINION OF THOSE BABIES AND SHE 
DIDN'T NECESSARILY SUGGEST THAT 
THE FIRST LADY DO SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT BUT CERTAINLY BY 
REMINDING US ALL OF THE IMPACT 
THAT A FIRST LADY CAN HAVE BY 
DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BECAUSE JUST TO PUT IT OUT 
THERE THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD 
THING TO DO. 
>> ABSOLUTELY AND WE'VE BEEN 
SAYING THAT THE IDEA THAT SHE 
WOULD SEE FOR HERSELF WHAT IS 
HAPPENING THERE AND CLEARLY HAS 
AN INTEREST IN THIS. 
SHE'S MADE IT PART OF HER 
PLATFORM, BULLYING, CHILDREN 
AND FAMILIES IVANKA TRUMP AS 
WELL HAS MADE IT PART OF HER 
PLATFORM SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO 
SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE. 
ONE WOULD HOPE IN THE DAYS 
AHEAD THE GOVERNMENT WOULD 
ALLOW JOURNALISTS TO HAVE 
ACCESS TO THE FACILITIES TO SEE 
MUCH IN THE SAME WAY. 
IT'S NO DIFFERENT WHEN FOR 
THOSE OF US WHO HAVE COVERED 
NEWS ABROAD WHEN WE WANT TO 
VISIT CAMPS OR FACILITIES, 
MEDICAL FACILITIES WHERE PEOPLE 
WHETHER THEY ARE CHIRP CHILDREN 
OR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE BEING 
HELD AS A RESULT OF WAR, AS A 
RESULT OF FAMINE, AS A RESULT 
OF NATURAL DISASTERS THE 
GOVERNMENTS TYPICALLY LET US 
AND IF THEY DON'T JOURNALISTS 
MAKE A BIG STINK ABOUT IT. 
THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW 
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE AND 
GENERALLY WE ARE PROVIDED 
ACCESS. 
JOURNALISTS ARE NOT ASKING FOR 
SOMETHING UNREASONABLE TO SEE 
WHAT IS HAPPENING. 
ALMOST EVERY JOURNALIST KNOWS 
IF YOU ARE TAKING PHOTOS YOU 
DON'T SHOW THEIR FACES. 
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE NEW TO 
EXPERIENCED AND SEASONED 
REPORTERS COVERING THE STORY. 
>> WE TALKED EARLIER TO A 
JOURNALIST WHO HAS BEEN WRITING 
ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS 
TO RUN THESE FACILITIES. 
IT'S AN AWFUL A LOT OF MONEY, 
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS TO RAMP UP FACILITIES 
FOR THESE CHILDREN, TAXPAYER 
DOLLARS. 
WE WANT TO KNOW HOW THAT MONEY 
IS BEING SPENT. 
>> HUNTER WALKER WHO REPORTED 
FROM YAHOO NEWS WHO WAS ON OUR 
AIR EARLIER THIS MORNING 
TALKING ABOUT THE FACILITIES 
THAT HAVE RECEIVED MILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS FROM THE GOVERNMENT 
RAMPING UP IN ANTICIPATION HE 
REPORTS TO THIS POLICY. 
HUNTER, WHILE YOU WERE JUST 
TALKING, JUST TEXTED ME AND 
SAID DURING HIS CONVERSATION 
WITH US HE MENTIONED THIS IS 
JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBURG AND 
HIS TEXT WAS JUST FOUND THE 
REST OF THE ICEBURG. 
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS BUT WE 
ARE GOING TO CALL HUNTER AND 
SEE IF HE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT 
HE'S REPORTING. 
>> YEAH THAT WOULD BE GOOD. 
THE DEBATE OVER IMMIGRATION 
CONTINUES TO RAISE. 
THE PRESIDENT WAS MEETING WITH 
HIS CABINET AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
AND IN CONGRESS THEY HAVE BEEN 
DEBATING AN IMMIGRATION BILL, 
SOMETHING CALLED A COMPROMISE 
IMMIGRATION BILL THAT INCLUDES 
A COMPONENT THAT PROHIBITS THE 
SEPARATION OF CHILDREN FROM 
THEIR FAMILIES. 
OF COURSE NOW WITH THE 
PRESIDENT SIGNING THAT 
EXECUTIVE ORDER PERHAPS THAT 
COMPONENT OF THE BILL IS NOT AS 
PRESSING BUT IT NEEDS 
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT TO MOVE 
FORWARD. 
MAYBE IT CAN GET OUT OF THE 
HOUSE BUT IT WON'T MAKE IT 
THROUGH THE SENATE WITHOUT 
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. 
EVEN BEFORE WE GET TO THAT IT 
MAY NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF ALL 
OF THE REPUBLICANS. 
IT DOES ADDRESS DACA AND IT 
DOES GET DACA RECIPIENTENTS A 
PATHWAY TO EVENTUALLY GAIN 
CITIZENSHIP BUT IT OVERALL 
REDUCES NOT ONLY RESTRICTS OR 
LIMITED ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BUT 
GREATLY REDUCES LEGAL 
IMMIGRATION. 
AND THAT'S SORT OF PART OF THE 
REASON WHY DEMOCRATS WILL MOST 
LIKELY NOT WANT TO GET BEHIND 
THIS WHAT THEY ARE CALLING 
COMPROMISED PIECE OF 
LEGISLATION. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO BE AWAITING 
THAT VOTE FROM THE HOUSE, 
SHOULD HAPPEN THIS AFTERNOON 
ABOUT 5:30 OR SO. 
>> YEAH. 
>> WE ARE AWAITING REMARKS OR 
IF ANY FROM THE PRESIDENT'S 
MEETING WITH THE CABINET. 
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS 
HAPPENING PROBABLY AS WE SPEAK. 
LET'S GO STRAIGHT TO WEIJIA 
JANG WHO IS JOINING US. 
SHE COVERS THE WHITE HOUSE FROM 
CBS NEWS AND SHE IS THERE ON 
THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN. 
WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING? 
>> WELL THE PRESIDENT JUST MADE 
REMARKS DURING THAT CABINET 
MEETING THAT YOU MENTIONED 
ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T REALLY MAKE 
ANY NEWS AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL 
FROM THE NOTES THAT WE ARE 
GETTING FROM OUR COLLEAGUES WHO 
ARE ACTUALLY INSIDE THE ROOM. 
HE DID AS EXPECTED TALK ABOUT 
IMMIGRATION AGAIN AND HE BLAMED 
DEMOCRATS. 
THAT HE BLAMED OUR NEIGHBORS, 
HE HE--MEXICO AND TALKED ABOUT 
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO MAINTAIN 
ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY EVEN 
THOUGH HE MADE THAT MOVE 
YESTERDAY THROUGH EXECUTIVE 
ACTION TO STOP THE SEPARATION 
OF FAMILIES. 
WE ALSO KNOW THAT MICK MULVANEY 
IS INSIDE THAT MEETING BRIEFING 
OTHER CABINET MEMBERS WITH THE 
OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET 
WITH HIS NEW PLAN AND PROPOSAL 
TO ESSENTIALLY SHRINK THE 
GOVERNMENT AND WE EXPECT MORE 
DETAILS BECAUSE HE WILL HAVE A 
BRIEFING LATER TODAY TO TALK 
ABOUT HOW THE PRESIDENT, HOW HE 
WANTS TO PERHAPS COMBINE SOME 
DEPARTMENTS SO THAT COULD 
REDUCE THE NEED FOR WORKERS AND 
FOR BUDGET OF COURSE. 
AND SO WE EXPECT THAT WILL BE A 
MAJOR ISSUE LATER ON TODAY AS 
WELL. 
BUT CERTAINLY AS YOU GUYS HAVE 
BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL MORNING 
IMMIGRATION IS STILL THE KEY 
ISSUE HERE AND THE PRESIDENT 
WANTS TO STRESS OVER AND OVER 
AGAIN THAT EVEN THOUGH HE MADE 
THAT MOVE YESTERDAY HE IS NOT 
BARKING DOWN AND WE HEARD HIM 
AT A RALLY LAST NIGHT PLAYING 
TO HIS BASE REALLY STRESSING 
THAT THE BORDER IS STILL SECURE 
AND TALKING RELATIVELY LITTLE 
ABUT KEEPING THESE FAMILIES 
TOGETHER. 
>> IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE GETTING 
VIDEO FROM THAT CABINET MEETING 
SO WE ARE GOING TO PIVOT OVER 
TO THAT, THANK YOU. 
>> HELLO, EVERYBODY. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING 
HERE. 
THIS IS A CABINET MEETING AND 
WE HAVE PLENTY OF THINGS TO 
DISCUSS AND PLENTY OF SUCCESS. 
WE'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT 
OF SUCCESS. 
WE'RE WORKING, HOWEVER, RIGHT 
NOW ON IMMIGRATION WHICH HAS 
BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY YEARS. 
WE HAVE COME UP WITH A LOT OF 
SOLUTIONS BUT WE HAVE DEMOCRATS 
THAT DON'T WANT TO APPROVE 
ANYTHING BECAUSE THAT'S 
PROBABLY THEY THINK BAD FOR THE 
ELECTION THAT'S COMING UP. 
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE A LOT 
OF PEOPLE SUFFERING AND THAT'S 
UNFORTUNATE. 
UNRELATED AND BEFORE WE GET 
INTO THAT, THE NEW EMPLOYMENT 
CLAIMS RECENTLY OUT JUST 
YESTERDAY SHOW THAT WE HAVE THE 
LOWEST LEVEL IN NEARLY A HALF 
CENTURY AT SOMETHING THAT IS AN 
INCREDIBLE STATISTIC, IN HALF A 
CENTURY. 
THAT'S A LONG TIME. 
AND THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING. 
IT'S DOING REALLY WELL. 
WE ARE NEGOTIATING TRADE DEALS. 
WE ARE DOING VERY WELL IN THOSE 
TRADE DEALS. 
IT'S TAKING A LITTLE PERIOD OF 
TIME. 
WE PUT TARIFFS ON CERTAIN 
COUNTRIES AND CERTAIN 
INDUSTRIES WHERE IT'S BEEN VERY 
UNFAIR TO THE UNITED STATES. 
OUR TREASURY IS TAKING IN 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THESE 
OTHER COUNTRIES ARE COMING 
ALONG THAT HAVE NOT TREATED US 
WELL AND THEY ARE NEGOTIATING 
VERY VIGOROUSLY AND LOTS OF 
GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING. 
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN 
CARE OF A LONG TIME BEFORE MY 
ADMINISTRATION CAME INTO BEING 
BUT FOR SOME REASON FOR 25 TO 
30 YEARS, NOBODY EVER LOOKED AT 
TRADE DEALS. 
THEY ARE OUT OF CONTROL HOW BAD 
THEY ARE BUT WE ARE GOING TO 
MAKE THEM VERY GOOD AND WE ARE 
GOING TO MAKE THEM FAIR FOR 
BOTH COUNTRIES FOR OUR COUNTRY 
AND WHICH EVER COUNTRY WE ARE 
DEALING WITH AND THERE ARE 
PLENTY OF THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE 
ALL BAD. 
THERE'S NOTHING GOOD. 
MY ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO 
ACTING SWIFTLY TO ADDRESS THE 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CRISIS ON 
THE SOUTHERN BORDER. 
LOOP HOLES IN OUR IMMIGRATION 
LAWS ALL SUPPORTED BY EXTREMIST 
OPEN BORDER DEMOCRATS AND 
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE. 
THEY ARE EXTREMIST OPEN BORDER 
DEMOCRATS. 
IF YOU LOOK AT NANCY PELOSI OR 
CHUCK SCHUMER YOU'LL SEE TAPES 
WHERE THEY WANTED TO HAVE 
BORDERS. 
THEY NEEDED BORDERS FOR 
SECURITY JUST A SHORT WHILE 
AGO. 
A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO I SEE 
CHUCK SCHUMER WE MUST HAVE 
BORDERS. 
HILARY CLINTON WE MUST HAVE 
BORDERS AND PEOPLE PENETRATE 
OUR BORDERS WE MUST GET THEM 
OUT OF OUR COUNTY NOW ALL OF A 
SUDDEN THEY ARE BIG OPEN BORDER 
PEOPLE. 
IT'S A CON JOB AND PEOPLE ARE 
SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THE 
DEMOCRATS. 
SO WHAT WE'VE CREATED AND 
THEY'VE CREATED AND THEY'VE LET 
IT HAPPEN A MASSIVE CHILD 
SMUGGLING INDUSTRY IS EXACTLY 
WHAT IT'S BECOME. 
TRAFFICKERS, THINK ABOUT THIS, 
HUMAN TRAFFICKERS ARE MAKING A 
FORTUNATE--FORTUNE. 
IT'S A DISGRACE. 
THESE LOOP HOLES FORCE THE 
RELEASE OF ALIEN FAMILIES AND 
MINORS INTO THE COUNTRY WHETHER 
THEY LEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER. 
SINCE 2014 ALONE, NEARLY 
200,000 UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN 
MINORS HAVE BEEN RELEASED INTO 
THE UNITED STATES AS A RESULT 
OF DEMOCRAT BACKED LOOP HOLES 
INCLUDING CATCH AND RELEASE 
WHICH IS ONE OF THE WORST. 
YOU CATCH THEM AND THEN YOU 
RELEASE THEM. 
MIGHT AS WELL SAVE YOUR TIME 
AND DON'T BOTHER CATCHING THEM. 
AND THIS IS WHAT WE ARE STUCK 
WITH. 
THEY'RE THE WORST IMMIGRATION 
LATCHES IN THE HISTORY OF THE 
WORLD. 
THE WHOLE WORLD IS LAUGHING AT 
THE UNITED STATES AND THEY HAVE 
BEEN FOR YEARS. 
THESE ALIEN MINORS WERE 
SEPARATED AND SENT ALL THE WAY 
UP HERE ALONE BUT THEY REALLY 
CAME UP WITH COYOTES. 
YOU KNOW WHAT A COYOTE IS? 
NOT GOOD. 
THESE ARE NOT GOOD PEOPLE. 
THEY WERE SENT UP HERE WITH 
HUMAN TRAFFICKERS BECAUSE THE 
DEMOCRAT SUPPORTED POLICIES 
HAVE ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN. 
DEMOCRATS ALSO REFUSE TO FUND 
THE PERSONNEL, THE BED SPACE, 
THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO 
HOUSE THE MINORS. 
NOW THEY WANT US TO TAKE CARE 
OF THE MINORS AND THAT'S FINE 
BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE US 
THE MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF THEM 
BECAUSE THE WORSE EVERYTHING 
LOOKS THEY THINK THE BETTER 
THEY ARE GOING TO DO WITH 
RESPECT TO THE BLUE WAVE WHICH 
IS TURNING OUT FRANKLY TO BE A 
RED WAVE IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
POLLS I THINK WE ARE GOING TO 
HAVE A RED WAVE NOT A BLUE WAVE 
SO THEY WANT US TO TAKE CARE OF 
BED SPACE AND RESOURCES AND 
PERSONNEL AND TAKE EVERYBODY 
AND LIKE LET'S RUN THE MOST 
LUXURIOUS HOTEL IN THE WORLD 
FOR EVERYBODY. 
BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE US 
THE MONEY. 
SO YOU CAN ASK THEM ABOUT THAT. 
WE HAVE TO HOUSE THESE MINORS 
AND WE HAVE TO HOUSE THEM 
SAFELY AND FRANKLY WE HAVE TO 
HOUSE THEM AND WE SHOULD BE 
TAKING GOOD CARE OF THEM AND 
THEN WE SHOULD RETURN THEM BACK 
HOME. 
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. 
BUT EVERY TIME WE ASK FOR 
RESOURCES, THE DEMOCRATS SAY 
NO. 
THEY SAY NO TO EVERYTHING. 
THEY ARE OBSTRUCTIONISTS 
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT'S GOOD 
POLITICALLY. 
I THINK IT'S BAD FOR THEM 
POLITICALLY I WILL SAY. 
IN ADDITION DEMOCRAT AND COURT 
ORDERED LOOP HOLES PREVENT 
FAMILY DETENTION AND LEAD TO 
FAMILY SEPARATION NO MATTER HOW 
YOU CUT IT. 
I SIGNED A VERY GOOD EXECUTIVE 
ORDER YESTERDAY BUT THAT'S 
TOTALLY LIMITED NO MATTER HOW 
YOU CUT IT, IT LEADS TO 
SEPARATION ULTIMATELY. 
I'M DIRECTLY HHS, DHS AND DOJ 
TO WORK TOGETHER TO KEEP 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT FAMILIES 
TOGETHER DURING THE IMMIGRATION 
PROCESS AND TO REUNITE THESE 
PREVIOUSLY SEPARATED GROUPS. 
BUT THE ONLY REAL SOLUTION IS 
FOR CONGRESS TO CLOSE THE CATCH 
AND RELEASE LOOP HOLES THAT 
HAVE FUELED THE CHILD SMUGGLING 
INDUSTRY. 
THE DEMOCRATS ARE CAUSING 
TREMENDOUS DAMAGE AND 
DESTRUCTION AND LIVES BY NOT 
DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AND 
THEY KNOW THAT BETTER THAN 
ANYBODY OUT THERE WITH A PEN. 
IF WE DON'T CLOSE THESE LOOP 
HOLES THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF 
MONEY OR PERSONNEL IN THE WORLD 
TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS. 
IT'S A VERY SERIOUS CRISIS. 
IT'S BEEN GOING ON SO LONG. 
THIS ISN'T TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION. 
YOU LOOK BACK AT 2014 DURING 
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, THEY 
HAVE PICTURES THAT WERE SO BAD 
THEY HAD A JUDGE THAT SAID IT 
WAS INHUMANE THE WAY THEY WERE 
TREATING CHILDREN. 
TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE 
COURT RULINGS AGAINST THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION. 
THEY TALKED ABOUT INHUMANE 
TREATMENT. 
I READ THEM. 
I LOOKED AT THEM. 
THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE. 
INHUMANE TREATMENT. 
THEY WERE TREATING THEM 
TERRIBLY. 
WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE SOME 
OF THESE PLACES THEY REALLY ARE 
RUNNING THEM WELL AND I GIVE A 
LOT OF CREDIT TO SECRETARY 
NIELSON AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE 
THAT HAVE WORKED. 
IT'S NICE THAT PEOPLE HAVE SEEN 
BUT IT'S STILL SOMETHING THAT 
SHOULDN'T BE TAKING PLACE. 
MY WIFE AND FIRST LADY IS DOWN 
NOW AT THE BORDER BECAUSE IT 
REALLY BOTHERED HER TO BE 
LOOKING AT THIS AND SEEING IT 
AS IT BOTHERED ME, AS IT 
BOTHERED EVERYBODY AT THIS 
TABLE. 
WE ARE ALL BOTHERED BY IT. 
BUT WE NEED TWO TO TANGO. 
WE HAVE 51 VOTES IN THE SENATE. 
WE NEED 60 UNFORTUNATELY 
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE RIDICULOUS 
FILIBUSTER RULE. 
SO WE NEED 60. 
AND I THINK I'LL GET FOUR OR 
FIVE OR SIX FROM SENATORS 
FRANKLY RUNNING IN STATES WHERE 
I WON BY 25 TO 30 POINTS. 
AND I THINK WE'LL GET SIX 
SENATORS MAYBE SEVEN BUT THAT 
STILL DOESN'T GET US TO 60 SO 
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO 
GET THERE AND PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND THAT. 
WHEN WE HAVE A MAJORITY IN THE 
SENATE WE HAVE A MAJORITY BY 
ONE BUT WE NEED TEN VOTES. 
SO WE NEED TEN ESSENTIALLY--WE 
NEED TEN DEMOCRATS. 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THEM. 
THEY'RE TOLD BY SCHUMER AND 
PELOSI DON'T DO IT BECAUSE WE 
WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN PICK UP 
SEATS. 
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE 
CHILDREN. 
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE 
INJURY. 
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE 
PROBLEMS. 
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING. 
ALL THEY DO IS SAY OBSTRUCT AND 
LET'S SEE HOW WE DO BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE NO POLICIES THAT ARE 
ANY GOOD. 
THEY ARE NOT GOOD POLITICIANS. 
THEY'VE GOT NOTHING GOING. 
ALL THEY ARE GOOD AT IS 
OBSTRUCTING AND THEY GENERALLY 
STICK TOGETHER. 
I RESPECT THEM FOR THAT. 
THAT'S ABOUT IT. 
THEIR POLICIES STINK. 
THEY'RE NO GOOD. 
NO IDEAS, NO NOTHING, THE 
DEMOCRATS. 
ALL THEY CAN DO IS OBSTRUCT AND 
STAY TOGETHER AND VOTE AGAINST 
TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO TAKE 
CARE OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES 
AND TO TAKE CARE OF 
IMMIGRATION. 
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE AN 
IMMIGRATION BILL THAT CAN 
REALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM NOT 
JUST--THIS IS ONE ASPECT OF IT. 
THIS IS ONE VERY IMPORTANT BUT 
SMALL ASPECT OF IT. 
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO A BILL. 
I'D INVITE THEM TO COME OVER TO 
THE WHITE HOUSE ANY TIME THEY 
WANT. 
THIS AFTERNOON WOULD BE GOOD 
AFTER THE CABINET MEETING WOULD 
BE GOOD. 
THEY ARE INVITED OFFICIALLY. 
I'LL LET YOU DO THE INVITING. 
LET THE PRESS DO THE INVITING. 
BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT IMMIGRATION IN THIS 
COUNTRY. 
FOR 50 YEARS AND LONG BEFORE 
THAT IT WAS A DISASTER. 
BUT OVER THE LAST 20 TO 25 
YEARS IT'S GOTTEN WORSE. 
EVERY TIME THEY WRITE A RULE OR 
REGULATION IT MAKES IT WORSE 
NOT BETTER. 
WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. 
WE HAVE TO HIRE THOUSANDS OF 
JUDGES. 
NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IS 
HIRING JUDGES LIKE THAT. 
THEY HIRE BORDER PEOPLE SO YOU 
CAN'T COME INTO THE COUNTRY. 
MEXICO BY THE WAY IS DOING 
NOTHING FOR US THEM HAVE THE 
STRONGEST IMMIGRATION LAWS THEY 
CAN KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF MEXICO. 
THEY HAVE A 2,000-MILE JOURNEY 
OF MEXICO. 
THEY WALK THROUGH MEXICO LIKE 
IT'S WALKING THROUGH CENTRAL 
PARK. 
IT'S RIDICULOUS. 
MEXICO DOES NOTHING FOR US SO 
THAT WHEN PEOPLE SAY WHY ARE 
YOU BEING SO TOUGH WITH NAFTA 
AND I AM BEING TOUGH BECAUSE 
IT'S A TERRIBLE DEAL FOR THE 
UNITED STATES. 
MEXICO IS MAKING $100 BILLION A 
YEAR OFF US AND THE HORRIBLE 
NAFTA DEAL AND I AM BEING 
TOUGH. 
ONE OF THE REASONS I'M BEING 
TOUGH IS BECAUSE THEY DO 
NOTHING FOR US AT THE BORDER. 
THEY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO WALK 
THROUGH MEXICO AND GO TO THE 
UNITED STATES. 
THEY ARE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, 
HUMAN TRAFFICKERS, COYOTES. 
WE ARE GETTING SOME REAL 
BEAUTIES. 
MEXICO IS DOING NOTHING FOR US 
EXCEPT TAKING OUR MONEY AND 
SENDING US DRUGS. 
THEY'RE DOING NOTHING. 
THEY COULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM 
IN TWO MINUTES YOU WOULDN'T 
EVEN HAVE TO DO ANYTHING BUT 
THEY DON'T DO IT. 
THEY TALK A GOOD GAME BUT THEY 
DON'T DO IT SO WE'LL SEE HOW 
THAT ALL COMES OUT. 
IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO 
SEE. 
SO WITH THAT I'LL END BY SAYING 
WE HAD A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS IN 
NORTH KOREA. 
WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. 
MIKE POMPEO HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. 
JOHN BOLTON WORKING TOGETHER 
WITH MIKE HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. 
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE HE IS. 
THERE HE IS. 
HE SPENT SO MUCH TIME IN NORTH 
KOREA, SURPRISED TO SEE YOU 
HERE. 
BUT I CAN SPEAK FOR BOTH OF US 
IN SAYING IT'S BEEN AN 
INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE. 
THE RELATIONSHIP IS VERY GOOD. 
THEY'VE STOPPED THE SENDING OF 
MISSILES INCLUDING BALLISTIC 
MISSILES. 
THEY HAVE DESTROYING THEIR 
ENGINE SITE. 
THEY ARE BLOWING IT UP. 
THEY'VE ALREADY BLOWN UP FOUR 
OF THEIR BIG TEST SITES AND THE 
BIG THING IS IT WILL BE A TOTAL 
DENUCLEARIZATION WHICH IS 
ALREADY STARTING TO TAKE PLACE 
AND I UNDERSTAND, MIKE, THAT 
THEY'VE ALREADY SENT BACK OR 
ARE IN THE PROCESS OF SENDING 
BACK THE REMAINS OF OUR GREAT 
HEROS WHO DIED IN NORTH KOREA 
DURING THE WAR. 
AND THAT'S ALREADY IN THE 
PROCESS OF COMING BACK. 
PLUS AS YOU ALL KNOW WE GOT 
BACK OUR HOSTAGES OUR THREE 
HOSTAGES WHO ARE RIGHT NOW 
LIVING VERY HAPPILY WITH THEIR 
FAMILIES AND WE ARE VERY HAPPY 
ABOUT THAT. 
SO WE'VE MADE TREMENDOUS 
PROGRESS WITH RESPECT TO NORTH 
KOREA EVEN SINCE I LAST SPOKE 
TO YOU. 
WHAT WE AGREE TO DO IS HAVE A 
MEETING. 
I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE MEDIA 
SAYS OH THEY AGREED TO MEET. 
ANYBODY WOULD HAVE AGREED TO 
MEET AND IT 
HE SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU 
BECAUSE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS 
INCREDIBLE. 
THERE ARE NO MORE ROCKETS 
GOING. 
THERE IS NO THOUGHT OF IT. 
THINGS CAN CHANGE. 
PERSONALTIES CAN CHANGE. 
MAYBE END UP WITH CONFLICT, 
MAYBE YOU DON'T. 
THE DOCUMENT WE SIGNED -- IF 
PEOPLE READ IT TO THE PUBLIC 
YOU WOULD SEE THE NUMBER ONE 
STATEMENT, WE WILL IMMEDIATELY 
BEGIN TOTAL DENUCLEARIZATION OF 
NORTH KOREA. 
NOBODY THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE 
POSSIBLE. 
IF YOU REMEMBER A YEAR AND A 
HALF AGO WHEN MIKE AND I CAME 
INTO OFFICE AND WHEN THIS GROUP 
CAME INTO OFFICE, EVERYBODY WAS 
TALKING ABOUT THERE IS GOING TO 
BE A WAR WITH NORTH KOREA. 
DURING THE OBAMA YEAR'S ALL I 
HEARD ABOUT WAS WAR WITH NORTH 
KOREA. 
YOU HAVE 28 MILLION PEOPLE 30- 
MILES AWAY FROM THE BORDER THAT 
HAVE CANNONS. 
THEY ARE ALL NAMED AT SEOUL. 
SEOUL HAS 28 MILLION PEOPLE. 
IT WOULD BE NOT A CATASTROPHE 
OF 100,000 PEOPLE OR 200,000 -- 
LIKE I WOULD READ -- THIS COULD 
HAVE BEEN A CATASTROPHE OF 50 
MILLION PEOPLE. 
I THINK WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO 
HAVING THAT SITUATION SOLVED. 
WE HAVE HAD VERY GOOD NEWS OVER 
THE LAST COUPLE DAYS. 
THEY WANT TO GET IT DONE. 
WE WANT TO GET IT DONE. 
WE ARE MOVING QUICKLY. 
NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN AN 
INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE FOR ME. 
WE'LL HELP THEM GET BACK ON 
TRACK. 
WE THINK IT HAS TREMENDOUS 
POTENTIAL. 
CHAIRMAN KIM THINKS IT HAS 
TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL. 
I WANT TO THANK THE PRIME 
MINISTER AND PRESIDENT NOON 
FROM SOUTH KOREA. 
HE'S BEEN TERRIFIC AND REALLY 
MOVING IT ALONG AND PUSHING AS 
HARD AS THEY CAN. 
BE WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES IT 
HAD NO CHANCE WHAT SO EVER. 
I WANTED TO THANK PRESIDENT CHI 
OF SHINE BECAUSE THE BORDER WAS 
STRONG DURING A CRITICAL 
PERIOD. 
UNFORTUNATELY THE BORDER IS 
GETTING WEAKER NOW BUT THAT'S 
OKAY. 
WE HAVE TO KEEP IT TOUGH. 
I WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT 
OF CHINA. 
WITH ALL OF THAT WE ARE HAVING 
TREMENDOUS NUMBERS AND 
TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC SUCCESS. 
I THINK WE ARE HAVING THE MOST 
SUCCESSFUL PERIOD OF TIME, 
ECONOMICALLY, PERHAPS IN OUR 
COUNTRY'S HISTORY. 
GPD NUMBERS HAVE BEEN GREAT. 
I'LL REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO 
SEEING THE ONES COMING OUT. 
I JUST SEE THE ACTIVITY -- 
YESTERDAY AND LAST EVENING WAS 
AN INCREDIBLE EVENING WE SPENT. 
TO ME, THAT WAS JUST AN 
INCREDIBLE EVENING. 
A LOT OF YOU WERE THERE. 
I SEE A LOT OF THE FACES. 
A LOT OF YOU WERE THERE. 
15,000 PEOPLE COULD NOT GET IN 
THE ARENA. 
THE ARENA WAS BIG. 
IT HELD 19,000 PEOPLE. 
SADLY 15,000 PEOPLE COULD NOT 
GET IN THE THE ARENA. 
IT WAS A SPECIAL EVENING. 
I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY VERY 
MUCH. 
NICK MULLVANEY WILL BE GIVING A 
REPORT. 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR IT? 
WE'LL SAY GRACE AFTERWARDS. 
WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO 
THAT IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS. 
>> I'M GOING TO TRY HARD TO 
MAKE THIS NOT BORING. 
MR. PRESIDENT, A LOT OF FOLKS 
AROUND THIS TABLE HAVE WORKED A 
LONG TIME TO GET YOU WHERE YOU 
ARE TODAY AT THIS MEETING. 
I CALL THIS THE DRAIN THE SWAMP 
CABINET MEETING. 
TODAY IS WHEN WE INTRODUCE THE 
ACTUAL ACTIONS THAT FOLLOW UP 
ON THOSE WORDS TO SHOW PEOPLE 
WHO WE MEANT WITH WHEN WE SAID 
DRAIN THE SWAMP. 
LATER ON AFTER THE PRESS LEAVES 
YOU'LL HEAR FROM ANDREW ON THE 
EXECUTIVE ORDER DEALING WITH 
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. 
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE 
GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION VERY 
BRIEFLY. 
WHEN WE GOT INTO THIS, ONE OF 
THE THINGS WE LEARNED WAS IT 
HAS BEEN ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS 
SINCE ANYBODY REORGANIZED THE 
GOVERNMENT AT THIS TYPE OF 
SCALE. 
IT HAS BEEN SINCE F.D.R. 
WE ARE ALMOST 20% INTO THE 21st 
CENTURY BUT WE ARE STILL 
DEALING WITH A GOVERNMENT FROM 
THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY. 
THIS LEADS, MR. PRESIDENT, TO 
WEIRD RESULTS. 
BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE REGULATE 
IN THIS COUNTRY, IF YOU HAVE A 
CHEESE PIZZA OR YOU MAKE A 
CHEESE PIZZA IT IS GOVERNED BY 
THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF 
AGRICULTURE. 
IF YOU PUT A PEPPERONI ON IT IT 
IS GOVERNED BY THE U.S.D.A. 
IF YOU HAVE A CHICKEN IT IS 
GOVERNED BY THE U.S.D.A. 
IF THE CHICKEN LAYS AN EGG IT 
IS GOVERNED BY THE F.D.A. IF 
YOU BREAK THE EGG AND MAKE AN 
OMELET THAT IS COVERED BY THE 
U.S.D.A. 
A LOT DOG, THE HOTDOG MEAT IS 
GOVERNED BY ONE. 
IF YOU PUT IT IN A BUN IT IS 
GOVERNED BY ANOTHER. 
IF YOU HAVE A SALMON IN THE 
OCEAN IT IS GOVERNORRED BY THE 
ADOPT OF COMMERCE. 
ONCE IT SWIMS UP THE LADDER IT 
HAS TO GO THROUGH THE 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR. 
>> THAT WAS VERY WELL SAID. 
THAT WAS VERY GOOD. 
>> A LONG TIME AGO WHEN I WAS 
15 I WORKED IN A FREEZER FOR A 
GUY THAT MADE FROZEN PIZZAS. 
PUT YOURSELF IN THAT GUY'S 
BUSINESS. 
ONE DAY HE IS MAKING CHEESE 
PIZZAS. 
THAT AFTERNOON HE IS MAKING 
PEPPERONI. 
IT WAS A DIFFERENT AGENCY HE 
HAS TO DEAL WITH. 
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. 
WE'LL TRY TO FIX IT. 
I WANT TO GO THROUGH A COUPLE 
OF EXAMPLES TODAY. 
I WANT TO GO OVER ONE OR TWO. 
A COUPLE OF THEM THAT MADE THE 
PRESS -- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS 
-- ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF 
EDUCATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF 
LABOR BEING MERGED. 
WE THINK THAT MAKES TREMENDOUS 
SENSE. 
THEY ARE DOING THE SAME THING 
GETTING PEOPLE READY FOR THE 
WORK FORCE. 
SOMETIMES IT IS EDUCATION. 
SOMETIMES IT IS VOCATIONAL 
TRAINING. 
THIS GOES BACK TO THE WORK 
IVANKA TRUMP DID EARLY ON ON 
JOB TRAINING -- IN FACT WE 
DON'T KNOW HOW MANY JOB 
TRAINING PROGRAMS WE HAVE. 
SOME PEOPLE THINK 40. 
SOME PEOPLE THINK 46. 
WE GET IT DOWN TO 16 AND PUT IT 
ALL IN ONE PLACE. 
IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY OR THE 
NEXT PRESIDENT IS NOT HAPPY 
WITH THE WAY IT IS GOING, RIGHT 
NOW 16 DIFFERENT PEOPLE AROUND 
THIS TABLE HAVE WORK FORCE 
TRAINING PROGRAMS IN THEIR 
AGENCIES. 
IF SOMETHING IS GOING WRONG 
YOU'LL COME TO ME. 
I'M SAY THAT'S SCOTT PRUITTS 
FAULT OR BETTY'S FAULT. 
NOBODY IS IN CHARGE. 
NOW WE ARE MAKING THEM 
RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABLE. 
TWO OF MY FAVORITES -- EXAMPLES 
OF HOW WE THINK WE CAN IMPROVE 
THINGS. 
EVERYBODY, DEMOCRATS, 
REPUBLICANS, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, 
STATE GOVERNMENT, YOU, ME FROM 
THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAVE HORROR 
STORIES ABOUT THE US ARMY CORP 
OF ENGINEERS. 
THEY PERFORM CRITICAL 
FUNCTIONS, THERE IS NO DOUBT 
ABOUT IT. 
OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST 
CENTURY THEIR ROLE HAS 
CONTINUED TO CREEP AND CREEP. 
THE PROPOSAL TODAY MAKES 
IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE ARMY 
CORP OF ENGINEERS. 
THERE ARE STILL THINGS THE ARMY 
CORP DOES THAT IS DEFENSE. 
THEY STAY THERE AND THEY 
SHOULD. 
THE THINGS THE ARMY CORP DOES 
THAT HELPS DEFEND THE NATION 
WILL STAY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF 
DEFENSE. 
THEY DEAL WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. 
THEY DEAL WITH ENVIRONMENTAL 
MITIGATION. 
THAT GOES OVER TO THE 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR. 
Y'ALL ARE REALLY GOOD AT THAT. 
SIMILARLY PORTS. 
IT USED TO BE A MILITARY THING 
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. 
NOW IT IS A TRANSPORTATION 
ITEM. 
WE THINK IT IS A MUCH MORE 
EFFICIENT LAYOUT. 
IT TIES INTO STREAMLINE 
PERMITTING PROCESS AND GOING 
ALONG WITH WHAT IS BEING DONE 
AT THE DOI. 
YOU WANT TO GET A PERMIT, YOU 
GO TO ONE FEDERAL AGENCY. 
THIS WILL HELP THAT. 
DOWN HERE WE TALKED ABOUT ONE 
FOOD SAFETY THING. 
IT IS F.D.A. AND U.S.D.A. 
-- WE MOVE THAT TO THE U.S.D.A. 
WHY? 
THEY ARE REALLY GOOD AT IT. 
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE FOR PEOPLE 
TO GO TO ONE PLACE TO GET 
ANSWERS AND PERMITS AND DEAL 
WITH REGULATORY AFFAIRS. 
THERE ARE THINGS U.S.D.A. 
DOESN'T DO AS WELL AS OTHER 
AGENCIES. 
THEY HAVE A BIG HOUSING 
COMPONENT. 
WHY WOULDN'T THAT BE BETTER OFF 
AT HOUSING AND URBAN 
DEVELOPMENT. 
WE PROPOSED TO MOVE THAT TO 
HUD. 
FOR YEARS THEY HANDLED THE FOOD 
STAMP AND SNAP PROGRAM. 
THAT MAKES NO SENSE. 
WE MOVE HAD THE OVER INTO HHS 
AND TO HAVE IT CENTRALIZED SO 
WE CAN DEAL WITH IT. 
NO ONE HAS EVER TRIED IT AT 
THAT SCALE, MR. PRESIDENT. 
PRESIDENT CLINTON TRIED IT A 
LITTLE BIT. 
NO ONE HAS EVER DONE IT AT THAT 
SCALE AND IMPORTANTLY NO ONE 
HAS EVER FOLLOWED THROUGH ON 
IT. 
NO ONE HAS BEEN GIVEN A TIME 
COMMITMENT. 
NO ONE HAS REALLY EVER COME UP 
WITH THE BIG STUFF LIKE THIS. 
EVERY TIME SOMEONES SAYS THAT'S 
OKAY THIS IS NEVER GOING TO 
HAPPEN. 
THIS IS GREAT IDEAS BUT IT 
DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE. 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST IDEAS THE 
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND 
LABOR MERGER DOESN'T GET 
INVOLVED IN BATTLE ON THE HILL. 
CONGRESS IS AHEAD OF US ON 
THIS, WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO 
SAY. 
THERE IS A CHANCE WE CAN GET 
THAT DONE. 
EVEN IF WE DON'T GET IT DONE 
NOW, THIS IS THE GENERATIONAL 
STUFF THAT I THINK YOU ASKED US 
TO DO WHEN YOU CAME TO OFFICE. 
WHEN RONALD REAGAN SAID 
GOVERNMENT WASN'T THE SOLUTION 
IT WAS THE PROBLEM. 
IT TOOK 15 YEARS AFTER THAT FOR 
BILL CLINTON TO GO ON TV AND 
SAY THE AGE OF BIG GOVERNMENT 
IS DEAD. 
THIS IS A GENERATIONAL THING. 
WILL IT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT? 
NO. 
SOME CAN. 
SOME WE CAN DO THROUGH THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS. 
OTHER STUFF WILL TAKE LONGER. 
THIS IS STUFF WORTH FIGHTING 
FOR. 
IT WON'T GET DONE UNLESS 
SOMEBODY TAKES THE FIRST STEPS, 
WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE DOING 
TODAY. 
THANK YOU FOR NOT ONLY GIVING 
US THE TIME TO DO THIS BUT THE 
ENCOURAGE TO DO THIS. 
IT REALLY HELPED TO GO BACK AND 
SAY PUSH HARDER. 
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THE 
PRESIDENT. 
THIS IS WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT 
WHEN HE SAID DRAIN THE SWAMP. 
THIS IS WHERE WE CAN SHOW 
PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR YOU AND 
EVEN THE PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T 
VOTE FOR YOU THAT YOU CARE 
ABOUT GOOD GOVERNMENT. 
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THINGS A 
LOT BETTER. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
I THINK THAT WAS TERRIFIC. 
I WANT YOU TO WRITE DOWN THAT 
ONE ANECDOTE. 
I THINK THEY SHOULD GIVE IT A 
BIG REPORT. 
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK SECRETARY 
OF STATE, WHO HAS BEEN 
INCREDIBLE, MIKE POMPEO TO JUMP 
DATE US ON NORTH KOREA. 
>> SINCE JUNE 12TH, A WEEK AND 
A DAY, WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT 
PROGRESS. 
NOT ONLY ARE OUR ALLIES MOST 
DIRECTLY AFFECTED, SOUTH KOREA, 
JAPANESE AND CHINESE BUT A 
BROADER CIRCLE. 
I HAVE TALKED WITH THE BRITS 
AND AUSTRALIANS AND OTHER 
EUROPEANS. 
EACH UNDERSTANDS WE HAVE 
FUNDAMENTALLY SET A COURSE THAT 
HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE 
HUMANITY. 
THEY ARE ALL ON BOARD AND 
SUPPORTIVE OF CONTINUING 
SANCTIONS UNTIL WE ARE 
COMPLETE. 
WE HAVE A UNIFIED WORLD TO JOIN 
CHAIRMAN KIM. 
I WAS THERE WHEN HE SAID IT. 
HE MADE A PERSONAL COMMITMENT. 
HE SAID WE'LL CREATE A BRIGHTER 
FUTURE FOR NORTH KOREA AND 
DENUCLEARIZE AS QUICKLY AS WE 
CAN ACHIEVE THAT. 
I'M WORKING HARD. 
I'M SURE THERE WILL BE BUMPS 
ALONG THE WAY. 
I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN GET 
THE WORLD TO UNITE BEHIND THIS 
IMPORTANT MISSION. 
>> YOU DID A HELL OF A JOB. 
HE'S BEEN IN A LOT OF -- HE'S 
LOGGED A LOT OF HOURS IN 
AIRPLANES GOING OVER. 
IT IS A 23 HOUR FLIGHT. 
WE ARE VERY PROUD OF YOU. 
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. 
APPRECIATE IT. 
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS MY 
MESSAGE TO LAWMAKERS HAVING TO 
DO WITH IMMIGRATION? 
THEY HAVE TO GET TOGETHER AND 
DO SOMETHING. 
THEY HAVE TO SIT DOWN. 
I'M INVITE SENATOR SCHUMER AND 
NANCY PELOSI. 
THEY CAN COME OVER AND BRING 
WHOEVER THEY WANT. 
THE LAWMAKERS HAVE TO SIT DOWN 
AND DO SOMETHING. 
OUR COUNTRY CAN NOT CONTINUE TO 
RUN LIKE THIS. 
WE CAN NOT HAVE OPEN BORDERS. 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE BORDERS. 
YOU DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY 
WITHOUT BORDERS. 
THEY HAVE TO BE ENFORCED. 
WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR 
COUNTRY. 
WE NEED THEM. 
WE HAVE MANY COMPANIES RIGHT 
NOW MOVING BACK INTO THE UNITED 
STATES. 
THEY NEED WORKERS. 
WE HAVE 3 .8% UNEMPLOYMENT. 
I WANT PEOPLE TO COME IN. 
THEY HAVE TO COME IN THROUGH A 
MERIT SYSTEM. 
WE CAN HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE 
COME TO THE COUNTRY THROUGH A 
MERIT SYSTEM. 
IN A VERY, VERY SIMPLE WAY, 
CONGRESS HAS TO GET TOGETHER, 
GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER, 
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, THEY 
HAVE TO COME UP WITH A 
SOLUTION. 
I HAVE IDEAS. 
THEY HAVE IDEAS. 
WE CAN PUT THEM TOGETHER 
EASILY. 
THERE IS SO MUCH HATRED -- I 
MEAN -- I'M NOT SAYING THIS 
BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF FALSE 
REPORTING AND MISREPORTING -- 
THERE IS ALSO A LOT OF GREAT 
REPORTING, BUT CONGRESS HAS TO 
COME TOGETHER. 
THIS IS BEST TIME TO DO IT. 
RIGHT NOW IS THE BEST TIME I 
HAVE SEEN FOR PEOPLE THAT 
REALLY ARE WELL-MEANING. 
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE AN 
ELECTION COMING UP OF. 
WE ARE WILLING LAUGHED AT AS A 
COUNTRY BECAUSE OF OUR BAD 
IMMIGRATION POLICIES. 
LAWS HAVE BEEN SO COMPLEX AND 
RIDICULOUS. 
WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A LAW. 
WE HAVE LAWS THAT ALLOW TO DO 
WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE 
DOING. 
WE WANT TO KEEP IT IN A HUMAN 
WAY. 
WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE. 
IF WE DON'T TAKE THEM IN WE 
NEED TO HELP. 
WE NEED HELP FROM MEXICO. 
WE WANT TO PUT THEM TOGETHER. 
WE DON'T WANT CHILDREN 
SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS. 
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND YOU GAVE 
AN EXAMPLE YESTERDAY OF 12,000 
CHILDREN. 
OF THE 12,000, 10,000 CAME UP 
EITHER ALONE, THEY WERE NOT 
NECESSARILY YOUNG CHILDREN OR 
THEY CAME UP WITH TRAFFICKERS 
AND COYOTES. 
THESE COYOTES ARE BAD DUDES. 
BUT THEY CAME UP WITH OTHER 
PEOPLE. 
THEY ARE USING THESE CHILDREN. 
THAT'S 10,000 OUT OF THE 
12,000. 
OF THE 2,000, A LOT OF THE 
PEOPLE -- WHEN THEY CAME IN 
WITH THEIR CHILDREN, THIS IS 
THEIR FIFTH TIME TRYING TO COME 
INTO OUR COUNTRY. 
THIS IS NOT A PERFECT 
SITUATION. 
THIS IS VERY BAD. 
PORT OF ENTRY, IF YOU GO TO A 
PORT OF ENTRY IT WORKS OUT 
NICELY. 
THEY HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD 
JOB. 
THEY DON'T WANT DO COME IN 
THROUGH THE PORT OF ENTRY. 
THAT'S CALLED DOING IT THE 
LEGAL WAY. 
MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE 2,000 
CATEGORY, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 
2,000 CHILDREN, THOSE ARE 
PEOPLE THAT TRIED TO COME INTO 
OUR COUNTRY MANY TIMES THE SAME 
WAY. 
THEY DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE 
PORT OF ENTRY. 
USUALLY THAT'S FOR A VERY BAD 
REASON. 
WHY DON'T THEY WANT TO GO IN 
LEGALLY? 
YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF THAT 
QUESTION. 
SO YOU HAVE A SITUATION THAT IS 
RIGHT FOR CONGRESS TO GET 
TOGETHER AND COME UP WITH A 
SOLUTION. 
AND I AM READY, WILLING AND 
ABLE TO HELP AND READY, WILLING 
AND ABLE TO TAKE THIS PEN RIGHT 
HERE AND SIGN VERY QUICKLY. 
>> DOES ZERO TOLERANCE STILL 
EXIT? 
>> IF WE TOOK ZERO TOLERANCE 
AWAY YOU WOULD BE OVERRUN -- 
YOU WOULD HAVE MILLIONS OF 
PEOPLE POURING THROUGH OUR 
BORDER. 
IF YOU TOOK ZERO TOLERANCE AWAY 
EVERYBODY WOULD COME. 
RIGHT NOW THEY WOULD BE GETTING 
THEIR LITTLE BELONGINGS AND 
THEY WOULD BE HEADING UP. 
YOU WOULD HAVE A RUN ON THIS 
COUNTRY, THE LIKES OF WHICH 
NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN. 
WE HAVE TO HAVE STRONG BORDERS. 
FRANKLY, THE WALL, IN TERMS OF 
DRUGS AND IN TERMS OF KEEPING 
CERTAIN PEOPLE OUT THAT WE 
DON'T WANT IN THIS COUNTRY, THE 
WALL IS IMPERATIVE. 
WE HAVE TO HAVE THE WALL. 
WE STARTED THE WALL. 
WE HAVE $1 .6 BILLION. 
WE ARE FIXS TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS 
OF WALL WHERE IT HAS BEEN 
OVERRUN. 
WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A 
SOLUTION. 
I WOULD CONSIDER IT WHETHER IT 
IS NORTH KOREA, WHETHER IT IS 
SO MANY OTHER THINGS, WE HAVE A 
LOT OF THINGS. 
LOOK, I HAVE BEEN GIVEN A VERY 
TOUGH HAND. 
BECAUSE I CAME UP HERE AND WE 
HAD AN ECONOMY GOING DOWN. 
WE HAD AN IRAN PROBLEM. 
WE HAD A MIDDLE EAST PROBLEM. 
TAKE A LOOK AT  LOOK AT WHAT 
WAS GOING ON IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST. 
IT IS BETTER NOW. 
WE WERE GIVEN A LOT OF BAD 
CARDS. 
ONE OF THE BAD CARDS WAS THIS 
IMMIGRATION MESS. 
IT WAS MADE WORSE BY ALL OF THE 
DIFFERENT CONTRADICTING LAWS 
THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED. 
WE ARE GOING TO WORK VERY HARD 
WITH MIKE PENCE AND EVERYBODY 
IN THIS ROOM. 
WE'LL WORK HARD TO SEE IF WE 
CAN SOLVE THE IMMIGRATION 
PROBLEM. 
WE NEED DEMOCRATS TO BE ABLE TO 
DO IT. 
IF THEY ARE GOING TO OBSTRUCT, 
IT CAN'T BE DONE. 
THE REPUBLICANS DON'T HAVE THE 
VOTES. 
I THINK WE'LL WIN ADDITIONAL 
SENATE SEATS. 
THAT WILL HELP US A LOT. 
UNLESS WE GET ADDITIONAL SENATE 
SEATS AND UNLESS WE KEEP THE 
HOUSE MORE OR LESS LIKE IT IS 
RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO 
BE -- UNLESS THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
SERIOUS AND THEY WANT TO COME 
ALONG AND THEY WANT TO GET 
IMMIGRATION WORK DONE. 
WE CAN DO SOMETHING THAT IS 
GOING TO BE HISTORIC. 
WE CAN DO SOMETHING THAT WILL 
BE HISTORIC. 
WE CAN GET IT DONE. 
I AM READY. 
I AM HERE. 
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE -- THESE 
ARE TALENTED PEOPLE. 
WE ARE ALL READY AND WE ARE ALL 
HERE. 
WE NEED VOTES FROM THE 
DEMOCRATS OR NOTHING CAN PASS. 
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. 
YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS HE IS 
MEETING WITH HIS CABINET. 
HE DISCUSSED IMMIGRATION AFTER 
REVERSING HIS POLICY ON FAMILY 
SEPARATIONS AT THE BORDER. 
I'M REENA NINAN. 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. 
WE ARE WATCHING THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES. 
LAWMAKERS WILL TAKE UP TWO 
SWEEPING BILLS TODAY TO 
OVERHAUL THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM 
AFTER ESCALATING PRESSURE IN 
RECENT DAYS TO ACT. 
THE FIRST VOTE ON HARD-LINE 
LEGISLATION IS REALLY EXPECTED 
ANY MOMEN NOW. 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WILL VOTE 
ON THE COMPROMISE BILL. 
IT IS BACKED BY THE PRESIDENT. 
THE MEASURE WILL GO TO THE 
HOUSE FLOOR LATER ON AFTER 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED AN 
EXECUTIVE ORDER ENDING HIS 
POLICY OF
