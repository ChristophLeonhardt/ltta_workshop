00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Good morning Hank, it's Wednesday. Happy Day 3 of Pizzamas!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,200
So yesterday it was announced that

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,800
Kristine Froseth & Charlie Plummer have been casted to play the leads

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,000
in the 8 episode Hulu adaptation of my first novel, "Looking for Alaska".

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,500
And today I wanna talk a little bit about the winding road that led to that moment.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:22,400
"[Looking for] Alaska" was published in March of 2005. I was 28 years old and living in Chicago. Sarah and I had been dating for like almost a year.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,800
I didn't know how to refer to her in the acknowledgments so in the end I thanked "the lovely Sarah Urist".

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,300
But that summer we got engaged on the same day Sarah found out she would be attending graduate school in New York City, which was very exciting.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,900
But also it was not clear to us how we were going to like afford to live in New York for two years.

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:43,500
I mean "Looking for Alaska" was selling okay, but not like "move to New York and quit your job" okay.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:51,100
Quick sidetone, since I'm talking about book sales, to me the point of writing is not to like create a book to sells a million copies or lives for a hundred years or whatever.

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,300
I think the point is to try to write something that matters to those who find it.

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,300
There are many books that have long been out of print that are still for me are candles in the way down darkness.

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,400
So yeah, maybe they're not widely read any more but they still matter. Okay, back to talking about money, we did not have a lot of it.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,400
And you can't eat art. Well I guess you can, but it's not a good long term strategy.

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,300
And then, quite suddenly, "Looking for Alaska" attracted interest in Hollywood.

17
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,700
One morning I was a person with a book that was not selling well and by that afternoon

18
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,400
I was a person who had been paid three times my annual salary for the movie rights to that book.

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
It allowed us to move to New York, it bought me time to write, it was life changing.

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,400
There was just one thing, which is that the deal contained no reversion clause

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,800
which meant that the movie studio that bought the rights to "Looking for Alaska" would own them forever.

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Now to be clear I understood what I was doing and the thing about selling something is that then you don't own it anymore.

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,700
So the person initially attached to write the screenplay was Josh Schwartz who, with Stephanie Savage

24
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,700
has made lots of great TV shows and Josh wrote an excellent script.

25
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,200
But then the studio wanted a bunch of changes, mostly to make it less like the book.

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,800
It's really easy to paint Hollywood producers and executives as cartoon villains and I know that some of them are.

27
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,100
But actually I just think it's really hard to get a movie made, let alone a good movie.

28
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,000
Like it's hard to get someone to say "I would like to write a $20 million check for this thing that doesn't exist yet."

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,100
And indeed they couldn't get anyone to say that, so after the "Alaska" movie was dead.

30
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,800
It stayed dead until 2014, when a different book of mine was adapted into a very successful movie

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,500
and then everyone was like "Hey has that guy written any other books?"

32
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,100
With "The Fault in Our Stars" movie, everyone, including everyone at the studio, cared so much about the book

33
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,400
and having that wonderful process really made me really want there to be an "Alaska" movie.

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:35,300
And the studio that owns the "Alaska" rights did try. They hired awesome screenwriters and a wonderful director only to cancel the movie at the very last minute.

35
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:43,400
In the past I've been pretty philosophical about the failures of the "Alaska" adaptation, but that time I was heartbroken and very angry.

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,600
So I told them that I was out. That they could obviously make whatever they'd wanted, because they owned the rights, but I did not want to be involved.

37
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,000
And then, a few months later a producer friend of mine called me with an idea.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,600
What if Josh and Stephanie, the people who cared about the book and championed it all these years, long before it ever had a big audience, were actually able to make it?

39
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:07,600
And what if they had more time than a movie has? Time to tell, not only the full story of the book, but also things that are only hinted at in the book.

40
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:17,200
And so "Looking for Alaska" was reimagined as an 8 episode limited series that will air on Hulu, a streaming service that did not exist when the book was first published

41
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,300
This time it is really going to happen! (I think).

42
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:27,600
It is not my series. It will belong to Stephanie and Josh, as it should, but they have been really welcoming to me in every aspect of the process.

43
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,400
Which included sending me the audition tapes of the actors who've been casted as Alaska and Miles

44
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:38,300
and I have to say both of them embody those characters for me in ways that I find surprising and kind of overwhelming.

45
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,700
I later learned that they both read the books years ago and really care about it.

46
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:49,300
Who knows how the show will end up but I'm so excited and really grateful to everyone who stuck with this for 13 pretty long years.

47
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:57,700
I mean, when "Looking for Alaska" was first published Charlie and Kristine were little kids. I don't believe in fate, but what good fortune that the story waited for them.

48
00:03:58,300 --> 00:00:00,000
Hank, I'll see you tomorrow.
