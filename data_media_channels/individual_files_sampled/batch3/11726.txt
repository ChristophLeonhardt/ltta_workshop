hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle one hundred years ago Russia was consumed by revolution and unprecedented violence it is not an understatement to say the Russian Revolution or Bolshevik coup d'etat was the defining moment of the 20th century how did it change Russia and the world crosstalking the Russian Revolution I'm joined by my guests here in Moscow Jeffrey Roberts he's a professor of history at University College Cork and a member of the Royal Irish Academy we also have Mark Sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst and of course we have Dimitri Bobbitt she's a political analyst with Sputnik international all right gentlemen as always crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump in any time you want and I always appreciate it Jeffrey Roberts let me go to you first here 100 years on I will ask the most obvious question was it worth it was it worth it yes I think it was why because what the revolution showed was that it was possible to change the world I mean what happened in 1917 was that the people intervened in history fundamentally changed the course of world history but there are those that say that it was a coup d'etat that the Bolsheviks didn't represent the people that represented a Burberry your ideology was a popular revolution the Bolsheviks came to power on the base on a wave of revolutions to approve Russia they weren't a revolutionary or a Bolshevik Revolution Modi what a revolutionary move the Bolsheviks were a majority when they seized power but there were very strong minority and they actually had a majority or in their majority in in the in the urban area so the point is you know it wasn't just a Bolshevik coup d'etat or insurrection and in Russia there was a revolutionary upsurge and the Bolsheviks were the beneficiary of it and upon this revolutionary acts birth was to not to just bring to power you know a particular group of people it was all about you know reimagining the future yeah trying to you know find a completely different way but but the people paid a very high price for that that view of the world mark I can see your position quite clear consider myself a communist maybe a post Leninist my wife is a communist yeah not a postmark sister postal in earnest I want to speak perhaps as I are theorists on the international relations level what the Soviet Union meant to the world it meant the end of Western colonialism and imperialism without the Soviet Union the ability of the third world to achieve independence certainly within the timeframe it did it simply wouldn't have a mark you can make the same argument to the end of the first world war saw the end of the Western empires the Russian policy it set the seeds of it eventually did decades later we just had the collapse of the of the Russian Empire one cannot say that that was necessarily part of the same process it was the 80s Nelson Mandela who was supported by the Soviet Union and himself was a communist of sorts was still opposed by Western governments the United States the United Kingdom up until he succeeded and then suddenly he's become you know the hero deem it that's the whole point it's not just about the Soviet Union it's about ideology and that is the biggest outcome of that political transformation you can use revolution you can use coup d'etat whatever you choose but the fact of the matter is the rest of the century or almost the rest of the century was defined by the out of the ideology that eventually took power in Russia there's absolutely no doubt that the Russian Revolution played the role in the major role in the twentieth century history and most of that influence was positive maybe not on Russia itself but on the world in general definitely positive but what I think is important and what I think is not discussed in Russia and in the West we see certain traits of this revolution the worst ones very revealing themselves very clearly in the West right now book destruction of monuments monopolization of science and the media is rolling speech controlling speech the mania of finding spies not only for inspires but people who don't fit a certain ideology at home so these are scary things if you ask me about the most negative aspects of the Russian Revolution I can refer you to the modern West to the United States and the UN you will see all of them talking about their revolution as a whole you know I think we can agree on something I will suggest you an image you know the Russian Revolution was like an elephant in the darkroom that three philosophers three wise men tried to touch you know being blind to trick the scribe one of them touched the leg and said oh the elephant is like a comb there on the one touch the trunk and said it is more flexible the third one touch the tail and said it's like a rope so if you ask me about the Russian Revolution was it a tragedy for our show with millions of people there that a dramatic fall in living standards for the majority huge majority of the population I will say yes in the in the living standards were pretty low absolutely absolutely then you asked me was it a popular uprising with people basically supporting the Bolsheviks during the Civil War opting for their own government and not an opposition liaised with the West yes was it an event that positively influenced the Western countries that that kind of encouraged them to introduce the social safety networks the negative ones are now evident you know what I was trained as a historian what always houses the in away from and stay away from the the sense of historical inevitability but why did the Bolsheviks win we there were more than one revolution that year okay there were different trends that were overlapping simultaneously why did they win was it just violence three reasons firstly they had popular support yeah secondly because of letting Lenin's leadership and thirdly because the revolutionary events took place in the context of the first world war and think about the Bolsheviks in 1917 they were the anti-war party they were the peace party that was enormously born to their pop to their popularity the other thing you have to remember about the Bolsheviks of course is that when they seized power in Russia they don't see themselves as just being involved in a Russian Revolution they see their action as part of the broader world revolution eight the the Russian Revolution see lady so a global revolution froze the freezer so from the Bolshevik point of view though the whole future of humanity was at stake in their actions in Russia so mark what went wrong because you're all saying this is very idealistic it was very painful it was very very costly but we ended up with I just need to check that right well was the civil war and the foreign intervention that followed yes that's what weren't wrong that's when it's in that's the context in which the revolution begins to degenerate in which Bolshevism which was a kind of popular revolutionary movement movement begins to take on that these kind of bureaucratic authoritarian repressive features which become embedded in the Soviet Union so it's the city became embedded in the system it's a very important role that's played by foreign intervention by Western capitalist States trying to strangle Bolshevism and the causes of the Bolshevik success just a little bit I agree completely with Jeffrey said especially the anti-war party aspect of Bolsheviks when the Kerensky and the provisional government seized power after the February Revolution that preceded the Bolshevik Revolution they wanted to continue the war this war that many Russians Russia had already suffered some six million casualties at that point the country was suffering from famine they were exhausted they couldn't understand why they were fighting what they saw as an imperialist war between a perilous European powers they wanted out another thing the Bolsheviks were incredibly disciplined as a party they understood power they knew how to take control of railroad stations telegraph stations they they understood the the nodes of power and communication that make society work and how to take and their foes there were they ever had a puppet opposed to each other as well and they had a sense a sense of unity the third one thing I would say is they had the support of the military and this was crucial particularly the Navy defections from the military at this point we're at thirty four thousand a month and they were flocking to the Bolsheviks because the Bolsheviks were promising the end of the war and they supported the bowl to fix all through the February Revolution up until the culmination with the October Revolution and without that crucial military support I'm not talking officers I'm talking the rank-and-file soldiers particularly in the Navy the Kronstadt sailors the Aurora and so on they were crucial to to being able to take power on the streets and hold government buildings it is the ideology is up violence embedded in the ideology or is that just a political tool to make to maintain power because you you know I think they're conflicting trends are there this is an idealistic movement and a lot of things that you know that we heard in the 19th century in the socialist labor movement here but once it comes to pass once you come to power you don't want to let it go and you have to you know for the good of the people or the good of the party or the good of the ideology and I think that's also I agree at the civil war but once once they had a foothold they would do anything it took to keep it well I would say that violence is akin to already Kauai Georgia's encoding neoliberalism and the mechanism of repression is very simple with radical ideologies we are right on the foot step towards happiness for the whole world and who is preventing us from clavinet just two million people in Donbass smash them you know these other whites in Syria who stick to a set kill them this is the attitude of the West and that was the attitude of the Bolsheviks but not from the very beginning you know I think it's a very important question why the Bolsheviks came to power two reasons first the February Revolution you know now in Russia we don't separate these two things we're talking about van revolution not about February and October and we'll get it right we're talking about that I think it's right because without February there would be no October what happened in February was that a bunch of liberal revolutionaries came to power and revealed themselves absolutely unfit to govern we have very similar people now opposing Putin they were very good at propaganda Western supported propaganda against that sort of hapless 90% of the Russian population in February 1917 were convinced that Rasputin slept with the Empress that he was a German agent that she was a traitor all this nonsense in a good faith us was much more important because if you talk about the economic situation the economic situation in February 1917 was not dramatically jumping people were eating about that other article after our break we'll continue our discussion on the Russian Revolution stay with our tea welcome back to crosstalk we're all things for considered I'm Peter bell to remind you were discussing the Russian Revolution 100 years on okay then we go ahead and finish up your book so the first reason why Boris came to power was the inability of liberals to govern after February 1917 and the second reason was that when the Civil War really broke out most of that Sarris generals Russian Patriots they took the side of the Reds this is something that is not often mentioned but there was no protection of the state the people because it certainly couldn't have been ideology I think I can give you a very good personal example Alexei Brusilov the famous general who defeated the Austrians in the First World War when the army officers asked him Alexei vanish what shall we do you know there was a civil war going on she said governments come and go Russia stays serve the government that would have tourettes because the other wise are liaised with our enemies from abroad they are not able to govern they want to return the present state ultimately well nature of death in the 20s in 1926 haven't written a book which was written by a patriot and monarchist but in which he praised Trotsky okay well I don't want to go into Trotsky okay Geoffrey I want to ask you something here because I think this is what something whatever your series I live here and you know this is the hundredth anniversary not much excitement I don't hear a lot of conversation certainly academics and pundits and commentators the whole it's it's not a big deal there's a lot of ambivalence that's probably more discussion going on in in Russia but about the revolution that than you might imagine yeah Russian public opinion is divided about the revolution isn't it you know there's some people you're half the population fix it was oh no not bad 56 percent yeah okay and the other half of whatever it's 44 percent a very hard on all work to go I mean it's a Russian how do you feel about it because I have serving studied and I have to say have extreme ambivalence to it and I think that's the word well the problem is that this anniversary it unleashed a lot of more passions in the West than in Russia that's what I know the instructions are completely misguided as economists compared Putin to the Tsar and said that he doesn't want to celebrate the centenary because he is afraid of sharing the fate of new hosts the second this is too big news more fake news the reality is that right now the West reminds me of the times of the Third International the idea that we can't have liberal capitalism only in the United States and the you will have to spread it all over the world over will be smashed that's a completely Bolshevist idea right the destruction of monuments like looking at history from today's viewpoint and saying that this guy was a slave owned that guy was a racist it's the same thing well abortion one thing I can tell you that yourself you go into any city in town in this country and you're still probably gonna find a statue of blood and there's still a lot out there you know what we already had heard that was the civil war was embedded in the ideology the of a totalitarian strain that culminated in Stalin because the great argument is we've already heard about Trotsky Bou hard and there could have been different variants different paths I'm not convinced to that I think it's a very totalitarian ideology I I'm not a big fan of the word totalitarian I think that itself is an ideology that was that was created in the West in the wake of the World War two to try to equate fascism and communism which I believe is a false equation I think is erroneous yeah I I think we have to remember that the Soviet Union was was born not only an internal struggle but it was from the moment of its creation it was attacked from the counter was it this is left out of a lot of Western history books that in 1918 the Western powers and Japan most European countries the United States they invaded the nasim Soviet Union in the middle of the Civil War to try to strangle the so strangle it in the cradle in every and I mean we're talking one little incident that's you know just in the past few years been recognized by you know British press The Guardian and others Churchill was a military commander of the British Expeditionary Force he used chemical weapons on Russian towns and that attack from outside helped solidify the support of the Russian people with this with the Reds the Bolsheviks and helped there was a siege mentality there was a paranoia that developed during the Soviet Union but with good reason Bolshevism change yeah the party change society ideology yeah there were purges there were murders people disappear some popular you know the Bolshevism of 1917 is not the same as the Bolshevism to emerge when is it because of the civil war and because of these seeds obviously this is the historical argument you know is is the authoritarianism on totalitarianism of Bolshevism inherent in his ideology its organization is its personalities or is a result of historical circumstances he shaped by the state my view is then it's shaped by that the circumstances but going back to your other question about v about violence and power for the Bolsheviks it was never just about violence and powerful her own sake it was about violence and power in the pursuit of utopia that's absolutely important to understand you know the radical utopian nature of the Bolshevik Revolution of the Soviet project yeah in retrospect did you say that was a dangerous goal to have utopia I think that that that's one of that days one the negative days one less is I agree I agree I quote you know idealism is not practical politics right now revolutions do devout it you devour their children yeah so you have to be careful what you wish for but that's not to say that their ideas themselves you know the idealism is anything inherently wrong with it one interesting things about the Western coverage of the of the unrep anniversary the predominant theme is is actually okay yeah there were all these negative consequences arising from the Russian Revolution yeah but actually did the ideas of the revolution yes did they inspire the revolution remain relevant today particularly irrelevant today when you know so-called neoliberal capitalism yeah it's experiencing you know such a crisis and there is a need to try on you know imagined alternatives imagine different futures to you know to do some different things yeah and you know the Russian Revolution and the deed you know the Soviet experience as a whole and that probably explains why Russians are very very adverse to revolutions and grammatical itical changes about numbers of people today in today in Russia 56% of people regret the passing of the Soviet Union but only 12% would like to see it restored as it was in Eastern Europe and Central needs to Europe the part recent poll by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development says that over half some fifty four percent of people would like to see the return of a command economy yes we've seen repeated poles and in Romania and Hungary that say their lives were better off right under the Soviet system in the United States Millennials Millennials of majority of them some 51% would prefer to live in a socialist or communist country this is YouGov and of the total u.s. population thirty-four percent would rather live you know what that reminds me of was when I was in graduate school at Berkeley you know and I was going back and forth between communist Poland and Berkeley and I reaped old people in in Poland that they're more communist and Berkeley than they're all of Poland here ok these Millennials I mean they should they should have we could send them back and let them live in Albania in the 1960s ok well I think that you asked a very important question was violence like innate in an ideology well I would say that any utopia and regrets if you talk a you know can spawn while look at Paul part you know is a utopian only purport the idea to have something like like encouraging feminism in Afghanistan that's an explosive idea which has been realized or they tried to realize it for 20 years there dear of radically change in Ukraine making it an enemy of Russia destroying all the communist part in Ukraine that's really saying absolutism having absolutes is an extremism you need violence to make absolutely to get them in a way in a way you know any change any dress we can agree that the Russian Revolution probably taught the worst in the past more than it taught the Soviet Russia so the West avoided a lot of our mistakes but there are a few things that the Russians learned and we have got like immunized from from these wrong ideas from the beginning for example let me give you an example the idea that a writer could be made better was by his origin you know in the Soviet Union writers were divided into proletarian ones and booze robots so now when Russians hear about women's writing gay writing immediately we have a very skeptical attitude and we say be a good writer who happens to be a woman be a good writer who happens to be both god forbid the world could learn something from the environment so there are certain bits of immunization that we got from this revolution and one of them is that we are adverse to any kind of revolution you know rapidly running out of time you know from one of the things I think is very interesting is well during the Cold War we had this captive nations colony on concept in the West you know a lot of people don't understand how much Russians suffered during the revolution during the civil war during the Second World War and you know and when one can make the argument then the entire breadth of the Soviet Union its culture and it was culture was attacked and it was it was destroyed destroyed in many ways I mean I'm thinking of the the Orthodox Church okay a lot of people don't understand how much Russians survived because of the pursuit of utopia and an ideology okay so it's come culture was destroyed but an alternative was put in place yes I mean there was a boy we're still here there was a Reno there was a reconstruction of culture of Soviet culture which wasn't wasn't completely bad I mean which actually persists this day I I personally I don't believe in utopias and I don't think that communism is the answer today's to the problems today but I personally don't want to live in a world where we stop fighting to create a better world it's a really good point and I want it just a quote here you perhaps you'll recognize real quick time people no longer obsess over the accumulation with things we've eliminated hunger want the need for possessions we've grown out of our infancy that's the favorite famous communist explorer and commander jean-luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise we need Starfleet in flag gear gentlemen we've run out of time absolutely fascinating discussion I'll watch the extended version of Artie's YouTube channel many thanks to our guests here in Moscow went thanks to our viewers for watching us here RT see you next time to remember crosstalk rules okay now for the extended version of our program Jeffrey what have we missed so far in our discussion area what is a seminal point that you want our viewers to understand about this 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution at the planet what works out is the radical nature of the Soviet project yes radical utopian idealistic nature it wasn't just the bar an alternative to capitalism a different socio-economic system it was a project for the transformation of human nature and you know the Bolsheviks and their communist successes kept coming back to their their utopian goals almost right away through today I mean Gorbachev Gorbachev was nothing if not an idealist no he what Gorbachev saw another kind of utopian you know that transformation so the driving force of ideas idealism utopianism right away from the revolution through Broadway to the end of you know I ended the sort end of the Soviet project that's that's the point I would like to how much is the the Soviet experienced the Russian experience because you have this ideology what's what's grafted onto what how did how did communist ideology become rusev I'd because you see the kind of the because we did have despotism in Russia you had a very hard rule with with the Czar I mean long history of that here a lot of people think that that is kind of a a red version of this kind of autocracy sorry it didn't actually get russified I mean the predominant kind of concept in Soviet science was the concept of Soviet patriotism okay they had a very strong Russian component no idea but Russia is our Assyrian had the same exact thing exhibit packages and was about citizenship it was about loyalty to a certain set of values it wasn't about ethno-nationalism yes that was thought yes and and that's one of the reasons for you know the Soviet multinational Empire held it so ever so the beginning was actually a big attempt to push down what was called great Russian nationalism was a great kitab refer also the divided and ruled over to minority groups particularly goes all the way through ukraine to the caucasus of that element is very much let me say that of course the lenient soviet union was a lot more like a genuine leftist state internationalist Stalin's was a much more nationalist project more rusev ID but in general Bolshevism or communism is not a Russian ideology and it produced very similar results everywhere I mean I interviewed the Russian soldiers he knows who were in Australian 1945 and at the time you know Austria was divided into sectors there was the Soviet sector where there was the western sector the Soviet sector immediately looked like the Soviet Union after the Soviet Army moved in and it was not the Soviet officials it was the local communists who who basically made the shops empty and the wife was with him at the same time when when I was in graduate school it was almost kind of a joke is that the only country that really made the Soviet model work and work well with the East Germans not because of the model but because they were German okay that's my point okay but I think that we touched upon a very interesting and important thing that I think we did not develop in the first part of our discussion just like mark I am absolutely against equalizing Nazis man communism there is a great temptation to do it and it started even before the World War 2 the Social Democrats were the first to use the word totalitarian and equalized in sort of equalizing Nazis and communists but despite certain like similarities on the surface the raids songs you know mass mass organizations the the results and the end aims you know final aims of these two audiologists were profoundly different to found and and right now what we see in Germany in not only in Germany but in Europe in general is a real rebirth real rehabilitation of any ideology that fought against Russia that fought against the Soviet Union not even against communism and people forget that Hitler actually justified the creation of concentration camps by the need to fight gulag you know the the German Nazis had the information about the Soviet concentration camps they were scared you know the German capitalists if you want they were scared to death so they opted for Hitler as as a deterrent against the Communist Russian threat and I'm afraid this story may repeat itself now again in Europe you know they again you know hypotheticals Jeff is there we probably what are the chances that we wouldn't have seen this kind of virulent fascism in Europe and the 1920s if it hadn't been for the Russian Revolution because you have the entire right conservatives focused on the red scourge I don't think you can blame fascism an awesome I don't think that's an appropriate word blame okay a cause and effect the main cause of fascism narcissism dictatorship authorities immense war Europe was the the world economic crisis late nineteen interfere nobody that's a fact but the perception is also the fear of the the Red Scare the Red Menace that I mean I I don't buy into that as being true that was a fake that was the fake news of their I think I think that I think that's a secondary factor you know it's the more face the more fundamental you know collapse of the economic systems and collapse of confidence in in capitalism yeah and the political consequences are of course the other point to make is that what actually stops this authoritarianism and nationalism and so on taking a grip on Europe and perhaps the whole world what happens is the second world war happens and it's the Soviet Union the happiness defeats nasty fascism and democracy Soviet Union actually saved the world for for you know foot for democracy it's really interesting Marco no one would ever say it was communism that saved the West you'd never hear that would you would you ever know and I'm not so sure I would put it in though that was the ideology the other yeah I think it's useful that if we separate when we're looking we look at the Revolutionary period with Lenin we look at Stalin's the purges the formation of the gulag and by the way the first concentration camp the first gulag in Russia was established by the British during the expeditionary forces invasion in 1918 they got there their models for what do you think most of our viewers have never even heard of died and the post Stalin period because that was vastly different and that is the Soviet Union that most people today remember fondly that have nostalgia for it's the the post Stalin Soviet Union of Brezhnev that most Russian people feel yeah well it was a time of economic stagnation but it was also a time of contentment it was the long a long period of economic stability earth free education free health care after catastrophic decades yes relatively a question I think I can jump in I think that actually when we are talking about the birth of the Soviet Union it was not just the early years of the Soviet power it was also the nineteen forties the post-war years because the Baltics Western Ukraine all these territories that were outside the initial Soviet Union they were integrated and with huge pain you know and this pain was hidden from the populace Brezhnev and crucial didn't want to tell the people that there were rebellions in in Lithuania in western Ukraine that was a taboo subject almost taboo right so a lot of Russians are still surprised you know they say how come these regimes are so hostile to us well I mean Stalin's time was the time of the birth of the so it was very much again you know we keep talking about power violence and ideology I mean incorporating the Baltic republics for example redrawing the map of Ukraine was that for ideological reasons are for security reasons and it seemed to me it was more security than than ideology annexed territories today I didn't say I didn't say it just been about security about power just annexed and take control yeah what they did was that she incorporated things and actually carried for a kind of revolution in those territorial I mean a nasty violent brutal revolution but that shows the utopian ideologically driven nature of the regime it's not just about I think the jury will still be out for many years if it was for ideological reasons for security reasons on the security side it was a wise decision because the German army advancing on Leningrad was defeated or rather made harmless in Estonian if they had started from Estonia they would have taken Leningrad 100% and that would be a huge tragedy because Leningrad has several million people including communist Jews all these people would be destroyed right so from the ideological point of view it was a huge mistake by Stalin it was not that even by George Kennan you know the US ambassador in in the Soviet Union in 1945 because George cannon there he saw the the mood there he said that these countries will ultimately poison the Soviet Union Stalin forgot what rule the minorities played in the revolutionary movement before 1917 so basically getting rid of these territories in 1917 saved the Soviet Union the future service the Union from a lot of trouble and now we're in the same situation when people now say that Russia is weaker than the Soviet Union I ask my question the Soviet Union could not defeat the West in Afghanistan the war that we didn't need that cost us a lot but Russia now has been successful in Syria we have been visited not by parasites I'm sorry parasites from Ethiopia and guava who came to us in 1970s we were visited by the Saudi King and the Turkish president Syrian people so in a way Russia you don't came here because of ideology what essence to power an ideology right we shouldn't really discuss the Soviet Union outside the context of capitalism because it was birthed as a reaction to capitalism it lived during a period of capitalism and it was ended and ushered in by cattle ISM communism such as it was is a footnote in history an interesting great experiment defined by capitalism the New York Times The Washington Post have all run headlines this week talking about the red century the century of communism it wasn't the 20th century was the century of capitalism and I'm interested to see what generation of Jeremy Corbyn in the UK the Millennials in the u.s. what they'll make of the next century what the next great experiment will be don't think he was just 30 seconds it wasn't it wasn't a no yeah for start off the Russell Revolution and the Soviet experiment fundamentally changed the nature of Western capitalism by the challenge to their policy on Western capitalism it has never been and will never be the same as it was before the rush revolution and before you know that the Soviet system and and his history so yeah I think I think you know what its deoxy in a way you could say my I have to jump in here but our discussion here is just proves just how contentious this issue is and okay no drinking on set here we've run out of time gentlemen I'm being told we have to go I hope you enjoyed the extended version of our program and remember crosstalk rules to history
