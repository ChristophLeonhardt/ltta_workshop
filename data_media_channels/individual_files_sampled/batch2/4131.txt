so he agreed to have the summit with Putin after NATO which in itself a symbolic victory for Putin he's been the bull in the china shop at NATO as some feared that could happen that's happened all of this seems to be at least rhetorically helpful to Vladimir Putin why why shouldn't more you bob menendez is out there going hey you know sort of somewhat snarkily and maybe somewhat seriously going boy he's he's doing Vladimir Putin's bidding something must be up look I think if he had done the Putin summit before the NATO summit a lot of people would be criticizing him for that you know this guy there's no wind with him this guy can't win what he's what he's doing but does he deserve to win on this with the Putin stuff well I think Howie's him I think actually this is gonna work out if it is true that what they've agreed to is a statement that strengthens the deterrent posture of NATO visa V Russia I think that's actually a pretty good platform for him to have this conversation with Russia I don't expect much to come out of this I don't think Vladimir Putin is going to give him much concessions on anything but it will do one thing it's odd that everyone is so worried about this since European leaders talk to Vladimir Putin all the time it's just an American president somehow they can't and it is not healthy and I'm no fan of what Russia has been doing for the last X years but it is not healthy for there to be no relationships for the United States and Russia and quite frankly all those relationships at various levels we build Africa well they're all gone and some of those need to be rebuilt hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more Meet the Press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you on YouTube subscribe now
