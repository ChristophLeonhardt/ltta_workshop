1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
today guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you about</font>

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,710
makeup because what I actually Bulls day

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,760
it retails at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 525 at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sainsbury's which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,370
got today and it's called purple power

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,380
there's actually it's more specifically

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,400
it's the purple Power 9000 there were I

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,920
think four series before this I didn't

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,260
do my research because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just had lots</font>

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,720
of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things on my mind at the moment</font>

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,250
but if i just opened up<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can show you</font>

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,840
what's inside before actually showing

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,960
you how it works so it comes with the

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
top tray in which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually mix</font>

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,790
up your makeup because it allows your

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,620
creativity come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you don't</font>

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,030
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all that boring expensive</font>

17
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,070
stuff where you know it just comes in

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,390
basic colors you should be able to

19
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,520
customize it<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself so I'm inside you</font>

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,890
get the skin tone pack and there's a

21
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,140
variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of colors depending on what skin</font>

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,940
tone you're after so here we have white

23
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,340
which wouldn't be ideal for me because I

24
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,449
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's like yellow we've got more</font>

25
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,180
darker pink we got red we got black

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,090
we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> grey and we've got green and</font>

27
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,500
we've got blue and they come with two

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,689
paintbrushes I actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get bit</font>

29
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,189
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today so I'm actually going to</font>

30
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">use the fake tan which comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">little tube like this I've not used it</font>

32
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,979
before but I've read reviews and it

33
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,210
doesn't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything about using its</font>

34
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,270
fake 10 but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what today night so</font>

35
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,640
I'm taking it now I am putting it in the

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,259
tray doesn't matter which Trey you use

37
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,270
and there's no preference and put it

38
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,700
there check out a bit of yellow because

39
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,490
it's a bit to read for a 10 not that I

40
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,110
have a preference for skin color or

41
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,150
equal it gives you the paint brushes by

42
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">their quite thin so just use your finger</font>

43
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">really don't matter and then just apply</font>

44
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,520
like site just all right there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,920
there's the time going in put the time

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,619
on like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apply gently</font>

47
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:53,100
to the face make sure you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> full of</font>

48
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">those creases in the eyes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll add the</font>

49
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,280
rest of the makeup lay up fantastic some

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,180

51
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,079

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,700
