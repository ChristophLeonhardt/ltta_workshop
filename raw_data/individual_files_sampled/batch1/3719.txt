when should you buy a home and when should you rent you should buy when you're planning on being somewhere for at least a good few years and when you've looked at the cost calculus and it makes sense for you to put money into a home it's not just the mortgage payment you've got to remember that there are other costs to homeownership that come along for the ride there's maintenance which can eat up one to two percent a year there's taxes there's insurance there's lawn care if you've got a lawn there's snow removal if you've got a driveway there are things that you may not be counting on the flip side of that is that if you look at appreciation in most markets home prices are expected to continue to appreciate it a little bit above the rate of inflation so that's good it doesn't make it a killer investment but it makes it a supplemental way to save if you expect that you're going to be someplace for a long time and you want to build up a supplemental savings account paying off a mortgage is a really really good way to do that to have a lump sum that then you can take and invest in another property when you decide that you're going to move I think it just comes at a point where you want to own home where where you want to take that place and make it yours and put some roots down and and it feels as someone who has owned homes it you know it feels different to own a place than to rent a place and so if you're at that stage in your life then I think it becomes something that you look at you
