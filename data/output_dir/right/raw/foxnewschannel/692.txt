HERE'S PART OF THE EXCHANGE.

00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:30,938
THIS PRESIDENT ACTED

INAPPROPRIATELY, PRESENTED TO

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

17
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:35,175
THERE'S AN OLD SAYING THAT

18
00:00:35,176 --> 00:00:35,809
JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE

19
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,210
DENIED.

20
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:37,478
I THINK RIGHT NOW ALL OF US ARE

21
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:40,214
BEING DENIED.

22
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:43,784
WHATEVER YOU'VE GOT, FINISH IT

>> WITH REGARD TO THE

25
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,591
INVESTIGATION, I HAVE HEARD

26
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,626
SUGGESTIONS THAT WE SHOULD JUST

27
00:00:52,627 --> 00:00:53,560
CLOSE THE INVESTIGATION.

28
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:55,362
I THINK THE BEST THING WE CAN DO

29
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:57,631
IS FINISH IT APPROPRIATELY AND

30
00:00:57,632 --> 00:01:01,635
REACH A CONCLUSION.

31
00:01:01,636 --> 00:01:02,970
>> Tucker: TOM FITTON IS THE

32
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:04,538
PRESIDENT OF JUDICIAL WATCH AND

33
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:05,773
HE JOINS US TONIGHT.

34
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,374
TOM, WHEN IS THIS GOING TO WRAP

35
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,576
UP, DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF AN

36
00:01:12,547 --> 00:01:15,716
>> THERE IS NO IMMINENT END

37
00:01:15,717 --> 00:01:16,550
DATE.

38
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:17,751
THIS OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION

39
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:23,390
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE RUSSIAN

40
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:24,558
COLLISION INVESTIGATION.

41
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:27,161
WE KNOW THERE HAS BEEN NO RUSH

42
00:01:27,162 --> 00:01:27,661
IN COLLUSION WITH

43
00:01:27,662 --> 00:01:30,364
PRESIDENT TRUMP, SO I DON'T KNOW

44
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:31,598
WHAT MUELLER IS DOING.

45
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,800
HE HASN'T PRESENTED ANY

46
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,934
INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE HE IS IN

47
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:35,569
HIS INVESTIGATION.

48
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,237
RANKLY, HE SHOULD BE ON THE HILL

49
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:39,206
TESTIFYING SINCE HE SEEMS TO BE

50
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:40,307
THE ONE RUNNING THE JUSTICE

51
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,110
DEPARTMENT AND THE FBI ON THIS

52
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:46,547
IMPORTANT MATTER.

53
00:01:46,548 --> 00:01:49,583
>> Tucker: SO HOW DID THEY

54
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:53,153
RESPOND, UNDER THESE QUESTIONS?

55
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,156
>> THEY SEEM, I THINK, OBLIVIOUS

56
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,559
TO THE CONCERNS AMERICANS HAVE

57
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,160
ABOUT THE CREDIBILITY AND

58
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:00,961
LEADERSHIP OF THE JUSTICE

59
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:02,996
DEPARTMENT AND THE FBI.

60
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,364
OBVIOUSLY UNDER THE OBAMA

61
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:05,566
ADMINISTRATION IT WAS AN

62
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:06,567
ABSOLUTE DISASTER.

63
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,675
DOESN'T TRUST THEM TO TURN OVER

64
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,944
THE DOCUMENTS I HAVE AND IT

65
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:17,945
CERTAINLY, THE DIRECTOR DOESN'T

66
00:02:17,946 --> 00:02:20,380
SEEM TO THINK THE IG REPORT WAS

67
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:21,582
ABOUT THE FBI.

68
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,484
HE KEEPS THINKING THAT IT WASN'T

69
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:25,118
ABOUT THE INSTITUTION OF THE FBI

70
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,927
WAS A LEADERSHIP OF THE FBI THAT

71
00:02:41,336 --> 00:02:45,172
MR. ROSENSTEIN HAS PRODUCED BY

72
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:49,977
WITH SUBPOENAS IN A TIMELY WAY

73
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:51,278
AND HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY EXCUSES

74
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:54,748
AS TO WHY IT TAKES YEARS AND

75
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:57,384
MONTHS TO TURN OVER A BASIC TEXT

76
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,391
PRESSED ON, HE SAID I HAVE A LOT

77
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,627
OF PEOPLE WORKING ON IT VERY

78
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:07,594
HARD AND IF THEY MISS IT OR

79
00:03:07,595 --> 00:03:08,729
THERE ARE MISTAKES THAT ARE MADE

80
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,365
I WOULD GO BACK AND SHARE THEIR

81
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:12,766
CONCERNS WITH THEM.

82
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:15,435
IT DOESN'T SOUND VERY SATISFYING

83
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:16,970
TO ANYONE WHO IS TRYING TO GET

84
00:03:21,109 --> 00:00:00,000
A GENERATION.
