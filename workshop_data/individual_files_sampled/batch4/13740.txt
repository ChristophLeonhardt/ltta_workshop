don't we yes ladies and gentlemen ben shapiro everybody give a big round of applause for our pal wink Martindale well thank you for coming and seeing us today my name's Jeremy boring I'm the god-king of shame shame Michael Noel's everybody I thought we were supposed to dress sexy Michael cosplay is only a comic-con are you of me definitely of Alesha so here's how we're gonna conduct our panel for today it's gonna be all QA all the time in fine ben shapiro tradition if you disagree generally with the things that we say we would love to hear questions from you first if you agree you're really who we want to hear from but we have to say this whole other thing it's a business deal so I think the microphones gonna be down here if people want to come up and ask us questions we I don't guarantee answers to questions we have been known to go on long tangents for our own amusement it may surprise you sir who's first curious understanding that the media and our educational system are under liberal control how how do you guys think we're still what appears to be mostly a conservative nation because our kids have been taught a certain way for generation you know what I'm saying it's kind of weird yeah there's still so many of us conservatives when you definitely you definitely agree with us Ben why don't you take the first one I mean I'm more of a pessimist so I'm not sure that we're still mostly a conservative nation to be honest with you maybe that's just from living in a life but I'm concerned that a lot of the main central tenets of conservatism have been lost over time which is why what you know we're all in the room to do or what we're trying to do on the stage is I think really important but I think that the short answer is that America is the most religious country in the west by a very very large margin and as that religious inclination tends to reduce so too does the conservatism inherent in that in that religious tradition people tend to age into kind of normal urban leftism that you see predominant in Western Europe that sufficiently depressing for you do you have anything I can maybe get from the experience anything you can get from the experience of being in a Christian school yeah salvation don't listen to hi hey how's it going um thank you for taking my question this question is pretty much for anyone who's opposed to abortion I'm going to use the number that I always hear about planned pick up that Planned Parenthood has aborted is it 50 or 60 million all of them you get all of them hi number so my question is so I I said I'm pro-choice and I and I think I've heard Ben say that it's portion is evil but my question is one is it a necessary evil for population control and my opinion is that is that if you know we're we're already at 325 million people right now i think i think wages are stagnant I think jobs are scarce because simply we are overpopulated so what is if what's the fifth thing can you provide the show that wages are stagnant or that we've run out of jobs I mean people are struggling people people are struggling and I'm seeing air so you should kill a whole lot of other people I'm not tracking your logic okay so my question is primarily um what do you guys think we would be off with an additional 60 million people on in this country right now versus you know how do we abort it yeah so there's this other thing that happened in the mid 20th century where several million people were killed in Europe and I think the world would be better off with them what do you guys you you can solve an awful lot of problems by killing people that's kind of where where you sort of draw the line if you don't draw the line at killing people you know you could solve the problem not liking your wife you could solve the problem I got some guy has the job you want you know to solve all those problems by killing people the thing is though you know there's 7 million unfilled jobs in this country 7 million unfilled jobs so we could actually use some population and there are and wages are actually not stagnating because of the there are so many transfers that the money people have the value of the money people have is so much further than it used to be a poor person today is living at the level of a middle-class person in the 80s which is not that long ago so we're actually doing quite well in that regard but even if we weren't I'm not sure that killing people is my first go to it now Malthusian Malthusian theory Malthusian economics has basically been disproved over the past 50 years Paul Ehrlich was was one of the main exponents of Malthusian population control theories he wrote a book called the Population Bomb back in the 1960s in which he predicted that within 15 years there would be mass starvation hundreds of millions of people dying from starvation and in the mid-80s he made a bet with another social scientist named Julian Simon and he said Julian Simon said to him pick any 5 commodities any 5 and tell me that the price is going to go up meaning that we're going to hit scarcity levels because of overpopulation and air lake picked 5 and Simon Says I don't care which 5 you pick the price will go down over time because human ingenuity is so much more powerful than population forces Simon won the bet err like lost the bet Ehrlich still teaches at Berkeley so it doesn't seem to matter who's right and who's wrong in this particular debate the fact is that the population now sustained on planet earth is well over 7 billion you know a century ago it was significantly less than half of that but we are now living more prosperously across virtually every area of the world specifically human ingenuity is so grand and great and killing off incipient human life forget about the moral problem of killing human beings killing off the creativity of sixty million additional human beings means killing our own future and I will I used to be in favor of abortion when I was young and irresponsible and stupid before we before we forced him into marriage and forced into living more morally but so I actually do see this point and I I remember the point at which my mind was open which is that one has to recognize without going into all the moral questions that it is a human life and as drew said you can solve a lot of problems by killing people so I'll give you the question that Diana Schaub uh bioethicists asked me which is which is if you want to control economic problems or political problems other than unborn babies which group of Americans would you be willing to kill yes so where's your point of viability then if you're gonna make the viability argument where's your point of viability you recognize that it's a human are you a parent I think your opinion will change when you become a parent I think your opinion will change when you hear the most beautiful sound on the face of the planet which is your child's heartbeat when did this in your partner's alone so low I think your opinion will change when a blood test at eight weeks shows that it is a boy or a girl and then you can come back to me and try to make an argument to kill a human being because you are making an argument to value one life more than another and I just don't think that's an argument that's your right to me and I actually think that your point is well made no I think your points well made there is a difference between a human who's been born in a human who hasn't been born and that's that the human who has been born has some ability to fend for themselves and therefore a responsibility to defend those who can thanks for your question we're gonna take some more hi again so earlier I asked I told then I kind of leaned to the left and he certainly brought me closer to the center but one of the reasons that I still affiliate with the Democratic Party is the environment and I really like to hear you rationalize your opinion because I'm all for free markets but I think that in the environmental realm that's one things that free markets cannot incentivize is and move toward sustainability so what is your opinion overall about government involvement and those sort of things the EPA so and so forth Michael want to field this sure I I am a conservationist I love the environment I'm a conservative and conservatives conserve I'm not an environmentalist and I think that there are different priorities here I think the environmentalist says we need to be nice to the ducks and the delta smelt because they have some right and some dignity that they deserve whatever I certainly don't think that I think that we need to be nice to the deer so that we can go shoot more deer I think it's fun to shoot there and we should be able to do more of it obviously there are certain externalities of our economy that damage the environment we need to take care of that there groups that do that there are reasonable laws asked by municipalities by States and by the federal government I think the left the environmentalists left has made an idol out of the environment it's no quits no coincidence that the environmentalist movement really came into full swing after the fall of communism I think they've made an idol out of it and I think it puts the cart before the horse sure but like for instance are any of you opposed to the EPA like I would like the EPA reduce to a guy with a one of those pool testers you know from state to state and test the water and say that's a little dirty would you clean that up please and I'll see you in another year you know I'm fine with that if he has to fly coach one of the reasons that a lot of conservatives oppose the EPA is not just because of what the EPA does it's because we oppose regulatory agencies as a general fact of government because the executive branch was not designed to be a legislative branch and the EPA makes her and promulgates enormous numbers of regulations that nobody understands nobody gets and that are then put into force by people who are unelected and can't be gotten rid of so that makes it an unsustainable form of government or at least a non answerable form of government look nobody wants to see the environment destroyed as far as the idea that market incentives don't accounts for a lot of environmental incentives that's actually not true I mean the fact is that fuel efficiency is something that is largely driven by free-market concerns I mean if you look at the last couple of years in the United States the the fact is that since the signing of the Paris Accords the United States has been the number one reducer number one reducer in carbon emissions across the world without even implementing the Paris Accords China assigned the Paris Accords and has been the number one polluter so signing a bunch of meaningless agreements doesn't actually do the job what does do the job is not only a greater commitment by individuals to environmentalism for but also a drive toward fuel efficiency that is worthwhile I mean nuclear energy has been largely cast out by the left nuclear energy is the safest form and most renewable forms we're gonna use that term the most renewable form of energy so you know I think that we're all on the same page as far as trying to help the environment but there is a balance in terms of how much of the economy are you willing to sacrifice and on behalf of what level of benefit to the environment into future human beings and how much power would you give to the federal government well that I'm saying is because like you just said you know you there are problems that need to be taken care of and if it's not going to be the EPA how are we going to enforce that on the state and local level and also by the federal and also by the legislature itself actually passing laws that that are answerable by elections there's a problem of the EPA is that it literally what they will do is they'll pass a law and then they will say go clean up the environment that's the law and then the EPA will just say okay well that means anything we want it to mean that's not it there's 9,000 regulations answer because also regulations I mean think I think we all agree - we're we're fine with doing away with the Department of Education for the very same reason right because it is a national federal based in Washington DC that is working with lobbyists and awful teachers unions that it's telling someone in podunk Texas how to teach their children and you have the same problem with EPA regulations where they're trying to legislate from afar and tell a rancher in montana what to do with his cows and his business and his run off when they've never even been on the ground in montana i also feel like the the country on earth that's done the most to innovate than the most to innovate in terms of fuel efficiency renewable resources all the technology that's created modernity is this one and when the environmental left can come up with some sort of theory for how to fix the environment that doesn't penalize the only engine that i think on this earth has the actual capacity to address any of these problems which is american ingenuity then i'll give it a more serious listen sure but what would you all agree that there is sort of a problem in the republican party in that they're not very environmentally conscious no no you know i think that the problem is is that every story that you hear on the news is two stories when it's the story and when it's why leftism will solve the problem nobody wants to say nobody wants to say there's no environmental problems we don't want to protect the environment the answer from the left is always more government always more power always more centralized power and on the epa at this point you know not only not only do they pass laws but when you appeal them you have to appeal to the epa so they can basically under obama they could basically show up at your house and declare your sink a waterway and start telling you how to shake it and i actually disagree with you guys slightly in the sense that i do think that both parties talk past the point with regard to environmentalism I think there's a reactionary thing that's been happening on both sides where if I say that I think that the world is warming which I do and I think that most of that is human-caused which I do but my solution is not massive government intervention which I also do the left that calls me a global warming denier and the right suggests that I'm falling for the greatest hoax in the history of mankind and I think that it's it's possible to have conversations at a level of policy without castigating the other side as either completely scientifically ignorant or as deeply you know attempting to destroy all forms of human freedom but it's not as much fun yeah I definitely disagree with that thanks for your question I want to ask you speak about racism in Hollywood casting and I think it's my opinion that real diversity isn't in who is cast as the hero of protagonist it's who is cast as the villain you know take star wars for instance you have a you know social justice warrior you know it's going to be diverse it's the most diverse cast and you know the rebellion is all the colors of the rainbow but the Empire is universally all-white actors you know John boyega was not cast as general nuts and domhnall gleeson wasn't cast as Finn the last James Bond movie to have a black villain or a non-white villain was you pet Coto and Live and Let Die 43 years of truth team go on films ago that in fact the the the last they say well was it the last Pierce Brosnan one would fought North Koreans but it was actually a plot point that the North Korean villain had to get plastic surgery to be turned into a posh white Brit before James Bond could kill him you know in the new the new Daniel Craig movies you know Felix sliders black mice is calm this isn't comic-con they said this one is political I'm with you down I'm with him and and so so money Felix sliders black money pennies black and now they won't eat one at each level to be James Bond when in the age of the Cinematic Universe why don't they just make him double o8 and give him his own franchise no it's like no James Bond needs to be black now so basically they want to movie about black spies so I don't what that has to do with James Bond you know look at the walking-dead yeah so what's the where's the question was what do you think about do you think that having media universally casting white people as villains has led to the anti white hatred that is very common in I think it's more of an effect than it is cause meaning that Hollywood tends to reflect kind of general leftist tendencies and I do think that it's been a long time since in the aftermath of 9/11 how many movies actually had radical Islamic villains there's a very very limited number of movies when night and when and when Kiefer Sutherland series did it he had to get on there and apologize so there's no question that Hollywood will go out of its way to portray usually white upper-class Brits who listen to classical music as the villains which is sad because I'm not only white but I'm also upper-class and I was into classical music but it's yes I mean Hollywood's perception of how race should play on screen it obviously has some connection with how people see race on screen but Drew's the best person to speak about this since he's been working in town for literally since before the camera during the tar pit you're the talkies they're not gonna work it's just not gonna happen you know things have gotten really bad I'll tell you this that you actually my agent actually gets calls for a writer who is a female latina you know or black female and things like that they're actually hiring according to race and and they have put forward the idea that you can't write out of your cultural knowledge which of course is exactly the talent that a writer has exactly the talented actors have so it has gotten truly insane and as a result I think the biggest result is not that people become more leftist although I do think Hollywood is a good way of selling leftist functions but the biggest thing is that it makes the arts obsolete and irrelevant because one of the big problems we have for instance is in Europe the spread of a mean small ignorant religion that nobody can speak out against without being accused of bigotry you can't make a movie about that so you can't have a you can't have art that addresses the major questions of the time if you have to lie in order to be a good person and art will all be lies and that's why I think superhero movies are all over the place because the villain is some octopus guy you know you don't know what the hell he believes in except that he's bad so you can't address reality and that's why the film American sniper shocked Hollywood it shocked them by making so much money because they kept saying to themselves you know people don't like stories about the war on terror because the movies they made about the war on terror we were the bad guys you know and so I think that they have basically silenced a huge segment of the artistic world kept them from addressing reality and I think that's degrading for everybody hi another question regarding property rights so growing up in Irvine in Newport Beach we've seen a huge growth in the population and thus far it takes a long time just get from one end of a vine to the other end of Irvine and how do we address property rights but also the NIMBYism that pervades Orange County and a lot of suburbs where people would never want people always want housing prices to go down but they never want the high-rise apartment complex to be in their part of town so I'm just wondering because you don't want to like people get mad when they transfer property from like an individual homeowner to some evil you know real estate developer so I'm just wondering how would we address that in the future so that way we can have a you know Orange County or south or South Orange County that we can actually live in without having to pay outrageous housing prices I think you and I would say the same thing so why don't you I don't hear what you have to say something I'll tell you well I'm almost all restrictive zoning laws drive prices up in New York you have you basically one of the great things about New York used to be that it had a Midtown that was alive and vital and people could live in it nobody can afford to live in it anymore because of rent control and the and the way they have basically tried to keep force rents to stay down you know I'm a little bit I get a little bit on the subject of NIMBYism I get a little bit suspect about this I don't understand why somebody should be asked to pay five ten million dollars to live in bel-air and then have a homeless shelter built next to their home I don't understand why that's supposed to be a city has to deal with its unfortunates it has to deal with the people who are not at the top it certainly does but it also has to allow a place for people to strive and succeed and rise above and I don't think that that should be a problem I don't think people should be condemned as selfish if they want to live off the money that they've made in a nice way so I think there's ways to zone places you know there should be a place for everybody you can do that through zoning but all restrictive zoning that tries to keep the tries to force the idea of virtue on the city destroys cities every time the price that was very noted what was it noted was that that patent was expired it came from the 1950s anybody could have gone into that industry or cronin in and had a generic drug to compete no one did my question is how can a free-market health care system work if the industry is dominated by these captive markets and monopolies it can I mean that's the problem right we have one of the problems that we have in America with healthcare it's funny everybody blames the market for the problems with health care but really health care in America even before Obamacare was so regulated the majority of healthcare expenditures that a person will ever face or in the last weeks of their life most people meet the last weeks of their lives when they're advanced in years and almost everyone over 65 is on Medicare in some form in this country so it's like so much of the spending that actually happens is already government controlled already government regulated we've had all these amazing innovations take place at the fringe level you have what's left over after the government it's finished and I think it's much like the kind of the last question about property rights we keep trying to use the government to solve problems that government actually creates and oh this only happens in government so as an example if I start a small business and I hire 20 people and I go bankrupt and then I go back to the investors and say listen I want to do exactly the same thing again will you give me millions more of your dollars they're gonna say well why would we give you money to do what you have already proven does not work and if that's what we do with politicians on a routine basis they come they break something and then they come and say this thing is broken let us fix it wait a minute you broke it and the very idea that you're now pitching in order to fix it is the thing that broke it in the first place that it's very difficult to accept that we aren't entitled to all of the things that we want you're not entitled to live in Orange County and pay the prices that you want to pay you're not entitled to have a drug at the price that you want to pay you're not entitled to the fruits of someone else's labor based on your sense of what that labor should be valued at and that's offensive especially I think in a culture where we're being told continually by the culture that we are entitled to things that we didn't earn we're being told that the people who did earn those things aren't entitled to them and in fact somehow stole them and we're also I think because of the the glories of the internet one of the one of the negative consequences is that we're used to getting exactly what we want exactly when we want it all the time and we think that that should extend out far beyond our own actual merit but but in all of these instances government creates destruction then then it's able to cure have you ever noticed though you buy if you bought a really big screen TV around 2000 the year 2000 it cost you about $10,000 buy it now it cost you about 600 if government had come in in the year 2000 and said oh my god poor people can't afford a big-screen TV $10,000 TVs would now cost $15,000 it's only because all can we be paying for them I think exactly exactly it's only in crisis - well everybody should be able to buy a house and you know price is the key here you totally hit on it which is that when you fly Spirit Airlines or one of the airline's they charge you for water they charge you for every little thing some people complain I don't complain I want to see prices as a consumer and so much of the problem with health insurance and the medical system is you don't see prices so when you go to your annual physical you go every single year you process that payment through health insurance it's not insurance you know you're gonna go you buy a product every year Martin shkreli was able to raise the price seven zillion percent his defense of that was that the consumer wasn't actually paying that price he was saying that he was actually gouging insurance companies and other middlemen along the road if you were able to bring prices to the providers of the service and to the consumers you you would see as it happens in every other industry you would see prices go down and they've so regulated the perfect analogy to that I was actually yelled at on a Pro Obamacare panel here at politican last year it's I said I want to be able to I can go to a car dealership and purchase the car that I want for my family it's gonna fit the three girls it's gonna fit the husband it fits the luggage the surfboards all that fun stuff and I can see the breakdown in the MSRP of what all of that is and you cannot do that with any insurance company in the United States and I think that maybe we could even say Obama meant well and with it with Obamacare but it didn't end up helping the consumer because it didn't give the consumer better options and it still didn't break down for the consumer the product that they were actually getting yeah I just really quickly want to respond opaque prices are due to them due to the market not government there's no government regulation saying that they can't put all the prices down every hospital could put all their prices down on their website they don't that's a market-driven problem you Michael you mentioned TVs the reason why TVs go down is there's a huge market for this super Ellie's market was eight thousand people that's it nobody entered the market because there was an incentive to do that monopolies that Donna that's clearly not right there wasn't incentive no only one guy was smart enough to capitalize on it but in for LASIK surgery and televisions there's a huge market so more companies go in no companies go in because there's only eight thousand people and you can't get to a price war over eight thousand people and that's the issue with house thank you so much for your time I see a lot of those t-shirts at my spin class by the way I I'm wondering should I wear it go wearing a fax over feeling shirt to spend but I think I might we'll be expelled and like never able to go back he's wearing a friend of the pod shirt okay so everybody didn't know but good day good day so you guys with the last time somebody wished you a good day talk about they say that we need more civility in our public life so that in the recent poll Newsom was at 44% John Cox was at 39% was 17% independent not knowing who so what is your take on California's politics and is there a chance to maybe in the future in a long time purple then you know my view of California is that there's the long road and there's the short road the short road is that people figure out that this state has been horribly wrong for years and they finally wake up and they decide to elect people who aren't going to allow the homeless to take over Los Angeles going to allow the jail's to be emptied who aren't going to allow the taxes to rise to absorbent rates in order to do all of those things and who aren't gonna allow the education system become the pit that LAUSD is that's the short road the long road the long road is that all the Conservatives leave the state continues to collapse in on itself like a dying star eventually all the people of the left leave just like they left Detroit conservatives moved from Texas where the Liberals come to take over up to Idaho the Liberals follow them there and eventually the consumers make their way in in a circle all the way back to California is that in 150 years the only people here are conservatives and beached whales basically that's the that's the that's the long rug I am gonna go drown myself this is so depressing I think that there is a low-hanging fruit in the state of California that the state Republican Party has failed at trying to convince to get to our side and I think that we're all fans of former governor Pete Wilson but Ben used to rant about this on the on the radio show a lot we lost a lot of Hispanic voters in the state of California since he was governor based on decisions that he made specifically about immigration but I think that there's what 16 million Hispanic voters in the state of California patronizing the Republican Party reaching out to them why aren't we reaching out to the low-hanging fruit of people that typically share values when it comes to Christianity and the the focus on a nuclear family and I think that there could be safety security pro-family it's something that should be addressed by the state of California in the Republican and to be fair to Governor Wilson I think that a lot of the measures that were proposed in the 1990s like not providing benefits to illegal immigrants I'm not sure that that's something that should be provided for illegal immigrants I also don't think great Hispanic population is voting on pure immigration issues I think that the press in the state of California has castigated Republicans as brutal racists for two decades based on extraordinarily little evidence and that conservatives have to fight uphill to do that but there's there there's several issues that conservatives actually could make hate on particularly among women and women in blue states as across the United States tend to vote on security primarily this is why the security mom's in 2004 turned out for george w bush in the state of california the crime rates have been rising nately it's a it's a less secure way of life in the state of California and making the crime case rather than making the education case or the spending case seems like a very easy strategy for Republicans in the state and they continuously refuse to do it it drives me up a wall that's why Elan car actually kind of stood a chance in a very liberal district because he was a prosecutor that had been putting people behind bars for a really long time hi there so I don't disagree with you guys but I do have a common Leptis talking point so it's about guns when we talk about like something here on the left is that well we're gonna yeah we hovering guards but we're going up against like the most powerful work for the Vietnamese yeah works for us in 1776 yeah I mean it's a it's a foolish argument again because there are innumerable times in recent history that guerrilla armies have held off much larger much better armed armies but beyond that the whole purpose of weapons ownership is to never use the weapons against the government the idea here is that the cost in blood and treasure of having to impose tyrannical rules on your own population are too high for you to attempt the risk that's really what this is about the folks in Texas want to keep their guns because they don't want the federal government coming to take their guns that's really the argument the Second Amendment exists to protect the Second Amendment to a certain extent yeah I mean the amount of human sacrifice that would be necessary in order to violate somebody's rights that way is simply too high it's just with the federal government on a fairly regular basis actually you remember even in very small-scale scenarios at cliven Bundy in Nevada the federal government surrounded cliven Bundy's ranch and basically said if you don't surrender to us and I'm going to blow you away and a bunch of militia members showed up you know I think it was a bad idea they showed up and the federal government essentially back down for the moment because nobody actually wants to see blood in the streets in the United States that doesn't mean that the power to use the gun is always used proper but that threat is ever-present and it should be ever-present it keeps a necessary check on the size and scope of the federal government can't help noticing also that all everybody wants to take our guns away surrounded by guys with guns I mean I used to I used to live next door to one of the biggest stars in Hollywood all day long and one of the biggest anti-gun Crusaders in Hollywood as well all day long these guys were going in with the go bags to protect her house and keep her from being you know attacked they called my house and said by the way we're watching your house too and I thought great now the biggest anti-gun advocate in Hollywood has enough guns to protect my house that's great but when she moved away I wanted a gun of my own just to keep safe yeah so it's like I think that the it is amazing how elite people lose touch with the fact that the rest of us can't surround ourselves with bodyguards and we'll just like to be safe and it's been an interesting pattern - I'm old enough to remember when it used to be just like people with guns were bad like and the average citizen has no right to a gun you'd be crazy why do you need an ar-15 to defend you in your safe family that's the military and the police's job and then Iraq and Afghanistan happen and then the military of the bad guys America is the bad guys even military shouldn't have access to certain things and then we saw with black lives matter and white cops only killing black children in the streets and never anyone else well the cops are bad they're pigs now they cannot have guns the point of the left is to try to whittle away the talking point and start with the average citizen in Texas for example that it cares about the Second Amendment and wants to uphold the Second Amendment and then work their way all down the line and there's a lot of people in the country that are afraid of who's gonna wield the power and who's gonna really have the gun yeah well that's the big joke to me about the left the one of the major pieces of hubris on the left is that they just assumed that one day they'll grab power and keep it one of the reason that you see all the insanity and in the media and in Hollywood about Donald Trump becoming president is because for eight years during the Obama administration they would walk around saying to conservatives this isn't your country anymore we got it it's never going back we're on the right side of history and then they just lost an election which has been happening for as long as there's been elections some people win some people lose and they can't believe it because they had convinced themselves that they would have the ring of power forever and so it's funny to me that they want only the government to have guns and it never occurs to them Donald Trump is the government yes you might lose an election and it might not be you who has all those guns anymore so to quote Owen Benjamin Donald Trump is Hitler and therefore we need to give all our guns to Hitler yeah he shouldn't have thankfully he hasn't taken my gun though yeah Trump says a woman's alright Trump says a lot of things good day good day sir if you have a question you can come up to the mic I'm sure this lovely lady will let you ask a question we're totally okay with hearing your question but you're just shouting ask a question man good day to you sir the Second Amendment another reason other than tyranny was for slave owners to keep their sleep population in check yeah it's not true George Washington's slaves had guns this is a there's a misunderstanding about slavery in the era of the founding and we conflated with slavery in the era of the Civil War neither of them is good but there was definitely an alteration that happened as a response to the concept all men are created equal which had not been a concept that existed on this earth until the founders pended and one of the negative things that happened as a result is that they they had to dehumanize and further enslave a certain group of people sort of as a way of not having to face the hypocrisy of the thing that they had that they had loosed but if you go back to the founding era when the Second Amendment was actually composed on all of the major plantation slaves owned weapons so it's just a I think that that's a retroactive talking point that takes about 80 years of human history reduces it down to sort of one caricature and the mistress to rewrite the main the main reason for the second amendment was the fact that the federal government had us was going to have an army and so the states were saying well if you if you have the army how do we keep the federalism alive how do we keep our states powerful and they say well if everybody has a gun you can form a militia and defend yourself from an overweening federal army that's that was the whole point of it Democrats are trying to and I'm just gonna wonder in what specific policies from legislators have been proposed to do that when they talk about banning ar-15s that would require that's banning people that haven't don't have it now it's not Connecticut proposed confiscation didn't they they might have been acted it I mean Hillary Clinton specifically suggested repeatedly that Australia's gun ban was was actually the way to go which was a confiscation ban one third of all guns in Australia where there been any laws proposed to do that I mean that's a talk you know because Democrats don't have the balls to actually say what they mean I mean this is really because here's the reason I say that the reason I say that is because if Democrats really believe that the key to preventing gun violence is fewer guns in circulation you of course need to confiscate weaponry in order to make that happen there are 300 million guns currently in circulation in the United States simply banning the prospective sale of future weaponry doesn't actually do the trick you're going to have to confiscate weapons when Democrats mention Canada or they mentioned Britain or they mention any other major country that has serious gun legislation on the books Britain didn't just ban gun ownership respectively it find people and jailed them for owning guns in their own houses if you want to be serious you're gonna be really serious about gun control of course you have to do that now if Democrats want to argue that that's not necessary I'd like to hear from them why it's not necessary to confiscate what in order for them to achieve their goal really good please clap hi I'm thinking we're taking two more questions everybody two more questions or just stand in the back and shout at us I'm Zack I'm a big fan I was just wondering what do you think the biggest advantage that the left has and the biggest avenge that the right has in these upcoming elections and do you think we're winning the culture war we have the Elisha Krause it's an advantage the biggest advantage that the write has is the left as Hillary Clinton proved they are garbage and everything I mean Hillary Clinton was the worst presidential candidate in American history and my proof is that Donald Trump is now president so it's so I mean really if you look over the last six weeks in the polls it is solely due to Democrats sucking at their own jobs that Republicans have gains in the polls it's Democrats deciding to be entirely insane about Brett Kavanaugh followed by Elizabeth Warren deciding to send smoke signals about her DNA followed by Democrats following Ted Cruz around the restaurants and harassing Ted Cruz me nobody wants to be near Ted Cruz enough to harass him at restaurants why would you and I love Ted it's a nice guy but it's it's it's really it's amazing as far as the Democratic advantage in the Democrats have a couple of damage systemic advantages I mean advantage number one is that it's an off-year election for a president of the opposite party that's always a systemic advantage for whoever is out of power advantage number two is the president calls people horseface that's all they I mean they have some material to work with I mean the President does have an unfortunate habit of sticking his foot so far down his own throat it comes out his ass again forming in a row gross of human anatomy but with all of that said it doesn't actually amount to a democratic argument so much as a Democratic scream of disenchantment and rage that may be enough to actually elevate them enough in the house but it also off puts an entire in in turn out there's a amount of the Senate particularly there's a new poll out today shows the Republican Party Believe It or Not has a higher favorability rating than the Democratic Party which is unheard of at a time when Republicans have sole control of the government so do I think I think that it's Deb it's difficult for the Republicans to overcome the map in the house it's very difficult for the Democrats to overcome the map in the Senate and so what you're gonna see is red districts get redder blue districts get bluer and purple districts basically remain at even keel the meaningly the outcome is probably Democrats when the House by a couple seats and Republicans pick up a couple seats in the Senate you know in in defensive horseface know you just in defense of it I'm not saying it's a good thing yes yeah but you're but I was kinda half saying that it what happens is when President Trump says these outrageous awful things get it I know we love we all know we love we okay you're not supposed to love it okay when he says these things he makes the left angry and then he makes the left mad and then the left gets real stupid and they start taking DNA tests and they start screaming and restaurant any any okay but even I think I may never went to a cool party in high school that that may traditional decisions what ninety-five percent of time similar to Merrick garland their new martyr and that guy's okay but I think that both of you are overestimating the sanity of the left I don't think it takes Donald Trump to drive the left insane I think any sentient human being I'm supposed to making the left completely insane we only don't agree a degree right is that I don't think you actually have to call anybody horseface for the left to lose their mind I think that if you say if a man is a man and a woman is a woman the left loses its mind this this is the last question the left question sup homies you realize this is the last question go for it I'm gonna get to the left so I'm a student at Cal State Long Beach and in my dumb social class but you repeat yourself they were showing us these stats about how how income has risen between races and how it's like Asians whites and then Hispanics and then blacks down here to run like the 30 to 40 range and it's a lecture class so I really don't have a lot of ability to argue with it but besides like single parenthood which I'm a product of what other arguments could I bring forward besides this systematic racist I mean single motherhood there's welfare dependency is obviously very high on the list there is an element of historic wealth inside families so there's a historic hangover effect from racism but that does not mean that current policy is racist a distinction that actually has to be made the amount of wealth in families that were not discriminated against in 1960 is on average higher than the amount of wealth and families that were discriminated against in 1960s that does not explain the amount of income ability in the Asian community or in the Hispanic community where by the way the wealth growth is significantly high justed for single motherhood the wealth growth in the Hispanic communities about the same as wealth growth from the white community according to a Harvard study that came out about six months ago and in fact that same study showed that there is even a disparity this one's kind of fascinating there's a disparity in income growth between black women and black men with regard to people who are growing up in similar economic circumstances to white folks so if you grew up in an upper-class home black males actually underperform in terms of the income trajectory as opposed to black female so then it has nothing to do with color obviously because black females are doing exactly the same thing than white females are doing in those particular circumstances again then you're tempted a massive spread on this particular study but what that suggests is that individual decision-making and cultural cultural reestablishment has a serious problem for particular groups that buy into it and for individuals who buy into a particular group mindset the real question is how do we care individual lives and the only way you care individual lives in the United States is to make individual good decisions thank you everybody for spending your afternoon with us
