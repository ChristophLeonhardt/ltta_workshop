a stunning new interview from California congressman Duncan Hunter who's accused of using a quarter of a million dollars in campaign money for his personal use the Republican lawmaker pleading not guilty in court yesterday claiming he's a victim of a political hit job and you have to hear this throwing his wife under the bus when I went to Iraq in 2003 of the first time I gave her power of attorney and she handled my finances throughout my entire military career and that continued on when I got into Congress because I'm gone five days a week I'm home for two so why and she was also the camp the campaign manager so whatever she did on that that'll be that'll be looked at too I'm sure but but I didn't do it but prosecutors say they've got proof of lavish personal spending including $14,000 for a family trip to Italy one of many family trips $600 to fly the family's pet rabbit to DC and 6,000 for a trip to Hawaii my panel is back with me Matt Welch Zephyr Teachout and Chris Wilson woman to woman Zephyr can I just say that again whatever she did that will be looked at but I didn't do it oh my gosh there's so much wrong with this and look the the evidence against him is totally overwhelming we know where this trial is going and this is a guy who supported Trump early by the way like Chris Collins who supported Trump early and what comes across is this guy doesn't even understand the charges against him because he's so corrupt they he can't even recognize corruption and that's what you see in the entire Trump so I don't know maybe he's loose he seems to me in that sound to be acknowledging the possibility of corruption but not on his own part he also defended himself last night against one particularly ugly claim listen to this did you call your wife and say that you wanted to buy a pair of Hawaii shorts but you didn't have money and she said that you should buy the shorts at the pro shop so that you could falsely describe that purchase as some golf balls for wounded warriors yeah know what I don't remember that but I would never do that I've never used any money any campaign money to anything to buy to buy myself anything that's left a lot for anybody else I've never done that Martha and what they've done what I've seen that they've done too is edit some of these text messages and make them look different than they are I can't pull down text messages from five years ago but no I would never do that they edited some text messages Matt that's what happened here I'm interested in his line of defense because it has some kind of resonance and threatening of stuff we already talked about previously in the show which is that he says this is the Democratic Justice Department going after us this is a witch-hunt he's using some of the same language that we saw and concepts not just everyday from Donald Trump kind of talking about this to end Rudy Giuliani talking about that this stuff in the media but also that Paul man affords defense team gave a closing arguments of his trial didn't say witch-hunt but they said hey look we're we're only here because we have a highly motivated special prosecutor who's rolling up with witnesses than these doing these things that argument did not work at trial that's pretty interesting including on a juror who had a maca hat in her in her trunk so Duncan Hunter is trying this out he's kicking that kicking the tires on a defense here but what we've seen this week in a very momentous week is that in a courtroom at least that defense is not working even with Trump supporters Chris the indictment alleges that the couple had been in dire financial straits quote they over drew their bank account more than eleven hundred times in a seven-year period resulting in approximately thirty seven thousand seven hundred sixty one dollars in overdraft and insufficient funds bank fees their credit cards were frequently charged to the credit limit often with five figure balances resulting in approximately twenty four thousand six hundred dollars in finance charges interest in other fees this is not stuff he can say was edited this is a paper trail obviously that prosecutors had is Duncan Hunter doing the right thing by going on TV and saying I did nothing I knew nothing but maybe somebody did but if they did it was my wife sergeant Schultz defense you know I think it is really dangerous for us too and I hear when jumping to just assume that he is guilty he clearly is blaming his wife for the possibility if something did happen I think we've all been conditioned too much law in order just assume that everybody who is charged by something automatically did what they hit and you know you look behind me right now I'm in the I'm in Travis County to Austin Texas and it reminds me of the time whenever there DEA of Travis County charged a governor that he didn't like Rick Perry with charges that ended up being completely untrue so there is for us to all just jump to assume that he is guilty they did this is I think wrong approach we should wait for the trial to play out would you be saying let's look at the paper trail which is pretty you know here party for the good of the party given what's surrounding him and given that the house is in play should he continue to run well he doesn't have a choice he can't be replaced on the ballot at this point and that's the other thing that gives me pause in this situation is that they brought these charges after was too late for him to get off the ballot we've heard rumors now for going on two years that this was going to happen and it now happens 90 days before the election that should give all of us a little bit of pause to step back and think wow is there something going on he'll it's politically motivated if he did it it's wrong and it's a serious offense but we should also not just all jump to conclusions that based on clearly poor management of money that he did something that is illegal I just gotta say one of the things that is so powerful about campaign finance laws and I'm I'm a campaign finance expert I've spent my career studying this looking at corruption different kinds of anti-corruption rules and one of the things that is so powerful and important about campaign finance loot laws it's a pretty bright line so that you look at is there a violation or is there not and of course you got to go forward go forward with the trial but this one looking at the indictment looks pretty cut-and-dried hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to
