although Donald Trump was able to restrain himself from tweeting or publicly commenting during James Comey is that testimony either that or he was drugged with some sort of zoo grade tranquilizer didn't say much that's to his credit I guess uh but he has started talking the attacks have already begun he tweeted this earlier today despite so many false statements and lies total and complete vindication and Wow Comey is a leaker so that is an interesting set of conclusions that Donald Trump came to after careful thought and analysis of what he saw James Comey say so first of all Wow Comey is a leaker it was commis personal memo who the hell else do we think would have leaked it I don't know why anyone is surprised that James Comey leaked his diary that's typically how it goes I don't think that reality winner had his diary entry so yes he is in fact the leaker and he is being very clear that Donald Trump thinks that Comey was lying now Kony was under oath he also said that Donald Trump lied and so we might be setting ourselves up for a possible confrontation we're gonna get to that in just a second with some video of Trump from press conference today but that tweet was not the only way that the White House reached out in response to Comey testimony President Donald Trump's legal team plans to file a complaint against Comey with the Justice Department Inspector General and the Senate Judiciary Committee early next week according to two sources on which is interesting because the Justice Department Inspector General uh manages Justice Department employees which thanks to Donald Trump Comey is not one so I don't know what involvement they would possibly have in this but he's interested in legal proceedings which as you described in today's production meeting could theoretically count as obstruction of justice itself which i think is interesting the entire idea that this the number of times our president shoots himself in the foot and thinking he's it's a very surface approach to everything I'm the president and before that I'm Donald Trump whatever I say everyone's going to call us behind and it's going to be the lodge happens is what's going down so he can he can just flippantly tweet now about what he wants to do to someone and how he's going to approach it not my lawyers come and talk to them you're the president we're gonna we're gonna be outside some of those realms as things you can and can't do here so he thinks they're going to come in but I'm trying to pinpoint exactly where he screwed himself I think was even earlier this week or last week and how he decided to tweet something but it shoots himself in the foot in the in in the long term so yeah so in in looking to stop someone or call out someone and say they're leaker and breaking the law you actually stopping your entire process or shutting down your legitimacy in a court of law yeah yeah and you're also politically I think paying a big price I mean if there's really nothing here if you're Donald Trump you want to get to the end of this entire process as quickly as possible all this whole thing is doing is prolonging everything it's it's about you think of a cloud of your presidency before you're going to have a bigger cloud and you just built part of it I mean you've just seeded that cloud to extend the metaphor I don't see how he has a real interest in this and and the other thing is we're going to get to the tapes I guess yes yeah we'll get that a second I would thought about that as well because he's camp I think there's a lot you know the the great American BS machine is in full bloom with Donald Trump tweeting and at Prescott I needed it for that so I don't know if we mentioned Paul Ryan saying this guy's a new at this it's hard from to know how to shuck justice it's pretty easy and if he doesn't know I don't care okay so if a 12 year old kid runs into the liquor store and steals the Snickers like oh well you know it's the first time he did it he wasn't exactly sure how to pull that off so let's go ahead let go no they jump on his back and treat him like a like a lifelong criminal because you know what Judy we got to teach this kid a lesson what happened to teaching a kid a lesson what happened a law and order and similar so what another one of the stupid offenses is okay we have a point maybe he tried to obstruct justice by getting him to shut down the investigation but Comey didn't shut down the investigation so it clearly was an obstruction of justice and somebody pointed out if you try to rob a bank and you slip and knock yourself out on the way in I still trying to rob the bank yeah a little crime well also look once you ask everybody to leave the office and you know keeping call me behind you knew what you were doing I mean the the he's a rookie and look this is just him getting clunky about stuff come on this is an obvious tile everybody leaves they don't want to leave some of them are borderline insistent on staying and still you insist that over there protests that they leave the room yeah you know what's going on she knew what he was doing so why don't we jump to the first video so I alluded in the intro that we've got the he said he said going on who actually allied well they have different reputations for telling the truth and one was under oath so why don't we equalize that would Donald Trump be interested let's find out be fair John oh absolutely proud nice you used to be before I ran um such a nice man always fair uh he did say under oath that you told him to let the Flynn or you said you hopes the Flynn investigation you could like I didn't say that so he lied about that well I didn't say that I mean I will tell you I didn't say that and and did he ask you to pledge and there'd be nothing wrong if I did say it according to everybody that I've read today but I did not say that and did he ask for a pledge of loyalty from you that's another thing he said no he did not so he said those things under oath would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of 100 percent and didn't say under oath I hardly know the man I'm not going to say I want you to pledge allegiance who would do that who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath I mean think of it I hardly know the man it doesn't make sense no I didn't say that and I didn't say the other so if Robert Muller wanted to speak with you about that I would be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you Jim who would do that who would I mean come on who would do that that's incredibly shocked really bad at this he's so bad at hiding that he's obviously lying and obviously bluffing because there he says that he'd be willing to a to testify under oath now the one thing that makes me believe him is that I know that he would have no compunctions under oath from lying now is live under foresee I want to do it anyway he doesn't want to do that he probably will end up having to do that because I think this investigation will eventually go there but no he doesn't want that but he can to go back to the politics of that I mean so the president is now going to testify under oath I mean you know this is really way off any agenda you had pal yeah you know I mean I'm your agenda wasn't oh I'm going to sit down and testify under oath a bunch of times about instruction of justice my administration before we having sex my first turn I'd even think about it like like so as as as the questions being asked books so would you under oath his legal team his administration his advisor like oh stop oh please don't have this question yeah he's gonna say yes but it's a John's point look this guy's a lot lied on more depositions if you know anything about Donald Trump in business he's been involved in more court cases and more depositions and he lies on many many of them obviously that you know the Trump University is probably the most the highest profile settlement that he's been involved in that was 25 million dollars for fraud fraud means lying so I think he's got some he's got some cred in the lying area and the interesting thing is uh the fact that he has to admit that he would say that yeah of course I'd be willing to go under oath for the the lying behavior that I exhibited when I fired my head of the FBI to stop an investigation into like this whole big mess is basically how he described seeing the first year of the Hillary Clinton administration going saying that should be under investigation all that for context someone revealed that on this same day in the first year of Barack Obama's administration he too was engulfed in scandal Fox News reporting that he used mustard on a hot dog so I guess there's a lot of weird scandalous behavior to go around long within sesame seeds are there who does their God so that's true but I do want to go to this second video because again like he he has to bluff like if you say would you be willing to do this implying that a true man would do it he has to say that he will even though he clearly doesn't have what he needs to back it up you can see that here is all the question of whether he recorded conversations with James Comey and he seemed to be hinting that there are recordings of those converse I'm not his taking anything I'll tell you about it over a very short period of time okay okay do you have a question here when will you tell us about the role for a fairly short period of time well you can hear people yelling why don't you tell us now when he says over a fairly short period of time I see one drop of sweat working its way down on his orange face and he is hoping that everybody forgets about their last course I'm not a bottle win I look just a really fat so it's a very short period time which I take to mean as soon as they finish that investigation to voter fraud that he was going to initiate all that bullshit right now all the burners are taken believe me I'm going to move that on as soon as I move it onto the stove as soon as I can the deal with the tape is this I mean in handicapping whether the weather tape or recording more purely exists obviously they don't you don't ask everybody to leave the office so you can have a private conversation with the head of the FBI and then record the whole thing it didn't happen plain and simple all the speculation are the recordings aren't they I think it's a false flag I think it's a it's a great thing that Trump did he threw it out there and now the media is tearing it apart I see it just a triangulated every which way there are no recordings I I'm 100% sure of it so this is the thing up so and after that he can as with the theme of him making news that doesn't help him they're already going to ask for the Comey memos we know that that because we know those exist um but after today the head the leaders of the House Rush investigation to Adam Schiff and Michael Conaway Republican and Democrat announced they sent us requests to his White House Counsel DOM again for any record of the White House out of their meetings these tapes that he keeps talking about that don't exist and after I've been by June 23rd so there's another level oh oh you said there's evidence please send mine there's your very short time Jordan 23rd yes that's what I'm not by your standard so we we await those although I agree it doesn't seem likely that takes it but I do but you never know maybe I know what you're thinking jank what do I get if I'm a young turks member well I'm glad you asked not only to get the whole two
