1
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,183
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

2
00:00:15,954 --> 00:00:16,420
PRIMARY DEBATE.

3
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:17,722
CONGRESSMAN DESCENT HAS COME A

4
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:18,523
QUESTION FOR YOU.

5
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:20,424
THERE ARE 850,000 ILLEGAL

6
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:22,393
IMMIGRANTS LIVING IN THE STATE

7
00:00:22,394 --> 00:00:23,161
OF FLORIDA.

8
00:00:23,162 --> 00:00:24,996
THAT’S MORE THAN 6% OF THE LABOR

9
00:00:24,997 --> 00:00:25,396
FORCE HERE.

10
00:00:25,397 --> 00:00:29,367
WOULD YOU DEPORT ALL 850,000 OF

11
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:29,834
THOSE PEOPLE?

12
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:31,536
>> WELL AS GOVERNOR I’M NOT

13
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:33,371
GOING TO HAVE THAT AUTHORITY,

14
00:00:34,673 --> 00:00:36,207
BUT HERE’S WHAT I WOULD DO,

15
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,709
THERE’S NOT GOING TO BE ANY

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,112
SANCTUARY CITIES IN THE STATE OF

17
00:00:41,113 --> 00:00:41,479
FLORIDA.

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,515
AND IF THERE IS A LOCAL OFFICIAL

19
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:45,717
IN ITS IN A CATEGORY WHERE THE

20
00:00:45,718 --> 00:00:48,119
GOVERNOR CAN DO THIS, ANY

21
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,124
THAT FROM THEIR POSITION IF I’M

22
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:53,525
ALLOWED TO.

23
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:58,330
SO HERE’S THE THING.

24
00:00:58,331 --> 00:01:00,332
IF YOU WANT TO DO ANOTHER

25
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,668
AMNESTY WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE

26
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:04,970
WANT TO DO, HONESTLY, HERE’S THE

27
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:08,140
PROBLEM WITH THE AMNESTY.

28
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:09,941
IT SENDS A SIGNAL TO PEOPLE TO

29
00:01:09,942 --> 00:01:11,410
COME ILLEGALLY AND IT’S A SLAP

30
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:13,478
IN THE FACE TO PEOPLE WHO COME

31
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:13,812
LEGALLY.

32
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:15,214
FLORIDA HAS ONE OF THE MOST

33
00:01:15,215 --> 00:01:16,949
VIBRANT POPULATIONS OF LEGAL

34
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,350
IMMIGRANTS, PLAYERS ARE TALKING

35
00:01:18,351 --> 00:01:20,953
ABOUT THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES

36
00:01:20,954 --> 00:01:22,988
AND THEIR KIDS?

37
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:23,922
THEY ARE CONTRIBUTING TO OUR

38
00:01:23,923 --> 00:01:24,923
SOCIETY.

39
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:29,395
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A LEGAL

40
00:01:29,396 --> 00:01:29,762
WORKFORCE.

41
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,134
IF YOU HAD A LEGAL WORKFORCE A

42
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:35,901
LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS WOULD NOT

43
00:01:35,902 --> 00:01:38,270
BE HERE AT THE FIRST FIVE OR TEN

44
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:38,571
YEARS.

45
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:43,108
PATH TO CITIZENSHIP?

46
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:46,712
>> I’M SAYING JUST THE OPPOSITE.

47
00:01:46,713 --> 00:01:52,685
I OPPOSE THE SHIMMER OBAMA.

48
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:55,488
BUT THAT IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO LET

49
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:59,625
LAWLESSNESS PREVAIL THE SUNSHINE

50
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:00,159
STATE.

51
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,761
WE CAN MAKE A DECISION, DO YOU

52
00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:03,129
WANT TO SHUT OFF THE MAIN

53
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,531
MAGNET, AND IF YOU DO THAT, WE

54
00:02:05,532 --> 00:02:08,334
WILL HAVE HUGE CONTRIBUTIONS

55
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:09,936
FROM LEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND PEOPLE

56
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:16,276
WON’T HAVE -- >> WHAT HAPPENS TO

57
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:18,945
THE 850,000 HERE ILLEGALLY?

58
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:21,781
>> IF YOU ARE HERE ILLEGALLY AND

59
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:22,849
IN THE E-VERIFY SYSTEM I DON’T

60
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,217
THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE A JOB THAT

61
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:26,186
AN AMERICAN WE WANT TO HAVE.

62
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,754
IT HAS DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON

63
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:28,989
WAGES AND IT’S NOT WHAT

64
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,723
PRESIDENT TRUMP CAMPAIGNED ON

65
00:02:29,724 --> 00:02:32,959
AND IT’S NOT SOMETHING I

66
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,127
SUPPORTED.

67
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:36,663
I’VE ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF

68
00:02:36,664 --> 00:02:37,831
AMNESTY AND SUPPORT ABOUT THINGS

69
00:02:37,832 --> 00:02:40,133
LIKE E-VERIFY, BORDER WALL AND

70
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:42,202
ENDING CHAIN MIGRATION AND THE

71
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:42,936
VISA LOTTERY.

72
00:02:42,937 --> 00:02:44,237
THAT’S THE DIRECTION WE SHOULD

73
00:02:44,238 --> 00:02:46,173
GO FEDERALLY.

74
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:48,775
>> WE WERE MENTIONED THERE, DO

75
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:49,876
YOU WANT TO RESPOND?

76
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:52,412
>> THAT IS THE DIRECTION YOU

77
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:55,115
SHOULD GO IN WASHINGTON.

78
00:02:55,116 --> 00:02:56,583
THEY HAVEN’T PASSED AN

79
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:58,318
IMMIGRATION BILL.

80
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,321
EMPLOYERS IN FLORIDA MUST HAVE A

81
00:03:01,322 --> 00:03:02,723
STABLE LEGAL WORKFORCE WITH NO

82
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,358
PATH TO CITIZENSHIP BUT YOU HAVE

83
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:05,926
TO HAVE AN IMMIGRATION FIX THAT

84
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:09,630
MEETS THE NEEDS OF THIS ECONOMY.

85
00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:10,998
GOVERNOR SCOTT DEALT WITH

86
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:11,932
E-VERIFY WITH HIS EXECUTIVE

87
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:17,338
THAT IS THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP

88
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:18,806
THAT GOVERNOR SCOTT HAS

89
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:20,941
PERFORMED HERE IN FLORIDA.

90
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:22,743
THAT’S WHAT FLORIDA FIRST

91
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,744
LEADERSHIP LOOKS LIKE.

92
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,212
WASHINGTON IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE

93
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:26,981
OUR PROBLEMS, WE NEED SOMEONE

94
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:30,351
WHO KNOWS FLORIDA BEST, WILL PUT

95
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:31,586
FLORIDA FIRST, AND KEEP OUR

96
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,155
ECONOMY MOVING IN THE RIGHT

97
00:03:34,156 --> 00:03:34,522
DIRECTION.

98
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:36,591
THE DEMOCRATS, THEY DON’T JUST

99
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:37,625
WANT SANCTUARY CITIES, THEY ARE

100
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:41,362
CALLING FOR FLORIDA TO BE A

101
00:03:41,363 --> 00:03:42,530
SANCTUARY STATE.

102
00:03:42,531 --> 00:03:44,332
THAT’S THE STATE OF THIS

103
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,734
ELECTION.

104
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:48,569
PLACES LIKE MARYLAND AND PLACES

105
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,505
IN CALIFORNIA EVEN ALLOW PEOPLE

106
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:52,941
WHO ARE HERE ILLEGALLY TO VOTE.

107
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,876
NOT ON OUR WATCH, NOT IN THE

108
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:59,614
SUNSHINE STATE.

109
00:03:59,615 --> 00:03:59,981
[APPLAUSE]

110
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:01,182
>> GOVERNOR SCOTT SIGNED THE

111
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:01,783
EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR THE

112
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,284
WORKFORCE AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN

113
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,354
ABLE TO SIGN E-VERIFY

114
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:07,355
LEGISLATION IF ADAM HADN’T

115
00:04:07,356 --> 00:04:08,957
WORKED TO KILL E-VERIFY.

116
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,759
WE CAN DO THINGS LIKE E-VERIFY

117
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,327
HERE IN FLORIDA, AND IF I’M

118
00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:14,496
GOVERNOR I WILL ABSOLUTELY

119
00:04:14,497 --> 00:04:16,131
PURSUE THAT COURSE OF ACTION.

120
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:17,833
HE SAID ON STRONG ON BORDERS AND

121
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:21,603
I THINK THAT’S A BIG REASON WHY

122
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:22,537
HE SUPPORTED ME.

123
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:24,406
>> WE WILL GO ONTO THE NEXT

124
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:24,706
TOPIC.

125
00:04:24,707 --> 00:04:25,841
AS WE MENTIONED IT BREAKING JUST

126
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:28,377
A FEW HOURS AGO, YET ANOTHER

127
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:30,479
DEADLY SHOOTING AT THE NEWSROOM

00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,181
OF THE CAPITAL GAZETTE IN IN AND

129
00:04:33,182 --> 00:04:33,749
ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND.

130
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,785
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE REPORTS OF

131
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:37,619
FIVE PEOPLE KILLED WHICH IS AN

132
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,123
ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR STORY.

133
00:04:41,124 --> 00:04:43,525
THE SHOOTING AT MARJORIE

134
00:04:43,526 --> 00:04:44,193
STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL

135
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:46,528
SHOOK THE NATION TO ITS CORE AND

136
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:48,130
AGAIN THRUST THIS ISSUE OF GUN

137
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:49,932
CONTROL AND SECOND AMENDMENT

138
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:52,368
RIGHTS INTO THE POLITICAL

139
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:52,735
SPOTLIGHT.

140
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:56,539
PHIL KEATING HAS MORE.

141
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,941
>> GUNS IN FLORIDA HAVE

142
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:01,911
HISTORICALLY BEEN BEST FRIENDS.

143
00:05:04,748 --> 00:05:06,749
BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT IS WHERE

144
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,318
THE STAND YOUR AROUND THE LOBBY

145
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,753
CAME BECAME INFAMOUS.

146
00:05:10,754 --> 00:05:12,321
BUT ON VALENTINE’S DAY THIS

147
00:05:12,322 --> 00:05:13,189
YEAR, PARKLAND HAPPENED.

148
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,291
THE DEADLIEST HIGH SCHOOL

151
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:21,998
OF ORLANDO’S PULSE NIGHTCLUB

152
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:23,166
MASSACRE WITH 50 DEAD.

153
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:24,400
BOTH TRIGGERING STRICTER CALLS

154
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:26,936
FOR GUN CONTROL.

155
00:05:26,937 --> 00:05:28,237
RICK SCOTT BUCK TO THE NRA,

156
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:34,344
DISTRICTS THE OPTION TO ARM

157
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:36,746
TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS WHICH THE

158
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:40,583
LARGEST HAVE REFUSED.

159
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:42,352
SINCE THEN, PARKLAND STUDENTS

160
00:05:42,353 --> 00:05:43,620
AND PARENTS DEMANDING ACTION ARE

161
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:44,587

165
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:05,809
REPUBLICANS.

166
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,948
>> RIGHT AFTER PARKLAND, A POLL

167
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:19,556
SUPPORTED A ASSAULT RIFLE BAND.

00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:22,726
AMONG VOTERS, 18-24 HAS THE

00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:24,795
LOWEST TURNOUT OF ANY AGE

BRACKET.

171
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:30,167

WANT TO BRAG ABOUT BEING A NRA

174
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:37,942
SELLOUT.

175
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:39,543
DO YOU STILL FEEL THAT WAY?

176
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:54,158
RESPONSIBLE AND SAFE GUN OWNERS

177
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,727

178
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:57,862
PARKLAND AND THE TERRORIST

179
00:06:57,863 --> 00:07:00,164
INSPIRED INDIVIDUAL WHO SHOT UP

180
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:01,365
THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB.

181
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:04,168
DO NOT LET THEM INFLATE IT, DO

182
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,607
HAVE BRANDS.

183
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:13,444
WE CANNOT ALLOW THEM TO SAY TO

184
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,251
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS BECAUSE

185
00:07:20,252 --> 00:07:21,986
OF WHAT MENTALLY UNSTABLE

186
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:23,488
INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE INSPIRED

187
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:26,191
BY A TERRORIST HAVE DONE TO SOFT

188
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:26,524
TARGETS.

189
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:30,228
IN FLORIDA, THERE ARE MORE THAN

190
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:32,964
2 MILLION LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS

191
00:07:32,965 --> 00:07:33,431
EXERCISING THEIR

192
00:07:33,432 --> 00:07:35,634
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS THROUGH

193
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:40,172
CWP’S AND CRIME IN FLORIDA IS AT

194
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:40,906
A SEVEN YEAR LOW.

195
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:43,508
IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT

196
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:46,778
WE DEFEND OUR RIGHTS AND PROTECT

197
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,580
OUR STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOLS.

198
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:50,849
THOSE TWO THINGS ARE NOT

199
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:58,157
INCOMPATIBLE.

200
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:01,560
AS YOU HEARD, FLORIDA VOTERS

201
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:02,261
OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTED SOME

202
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:04,163
OVER TIGHTENING OF GUN LAWS.

203
00:08:04,164 --> 00:08:05,631
BUT WHEN GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT

204
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:07,633
ALSO A STAUNCH DEFENDER OF THE

205
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:08,901
SECOND MINUTE SIGN THAT LAW, HE

206
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:10,569
SAID AT THE TIME YOU WOULD HAVE

207
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:21,847
WITH FLORIDA VOTERS?

208
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:22,281
>> NOT AT ALL.

209
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:22,948
MY WIFE AND I HAVE TWO YOUNG

210
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:24,750
KIDS OWE UNDER THE AGE OF TWO.

211
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:26,953
THE THOUGHT THAT SOMEONE WOULD

212
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:32,358
THOSE PARENTS MUST FEEL, I CAN’T

213
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:33,960
EVEN IMAGINE IT.

214
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:35,962
BUT IT WASN’T BECAUSE OF THE

215
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:37,562
SECOND AMENDMENT THAT THAT

216
00:08:37,563 --> 00:08:38,697
HAPPENED, IT WAS UTTER FAILURE

217
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:40,966
OF BOTH THE LOCALS AND THE FBI.

218
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:43,769
IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN GOVERNOR, I

219
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,771
WOULD HAVE SIGNED GUN CONTROL

220
00:08:44,772 --> 00:08:48,174
AND I WOULD HAVE REMOVED THAT

221
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:50,176
SHERIFF FROM BROWARD COUNTRY.

222
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:51,177
COUNTY.

223
00:08:51,178 --> 00:08:52,612
HE FAILED HIS CITIZENS AND HE

224
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:57,283
YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN THE FBI THAT

225
00:08:57,284 --> 00:08:59,552
GOT TWO PHONE CALLS ABOUT THIS

226
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:00,119
MONSTER.

227
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,589
THE FIRST ONE THEY LOVE, AND THE

228
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,858
SECOND ONE, THEY GET ANOTHER

229
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:05,825
ONE.

230
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:07,560
THEY PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER,

231
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:10,363
AND WHAT DID THEY DECIDE TO DO?

232
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:10,764
NOTHING.

233
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:11,865
THEY WENT OUT TO LUNCH.

234
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,237
THE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY IS

235
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:20,407
WHAT PUTS THOSE PEOPLE AT RISK.

236
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:22,609
THOSE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

237
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,946
FIRED THE NEXT DAY.

238
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:31,552
>> Bret: WOULD YOU HAVE FIRED

239
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:37,357
GO.

240
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:40,227
HE BROKE PROMISES TO THOSE

241
00:09:40,228 --> 00:09:40,928
STUDENTS, AND THAT HAS PUT ALL

242
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:43,564
OF OUR STUDENTS AT RISK.

243
00:09:43,565 --> 00:09:46,567
THAT INDIVIDUAL WAS EXPELLED FOR

244
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:47,167
A WEAPONS VIOLATION.

245
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:48,969
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT MADE THREE

246
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,771
DOZEN VISITS TO THEIR HOME.

247
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:51,405
DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND

248
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:52,973
FAMILIES VISITED THE HOME

249
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:54,775
BECAUSE HE POSTED YOUTUBE VIDEO

250
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:57,978
SAYING, I WANT TO BE A

251
00:09:57,979 --> 00:09:58,779
PROFESSIONAL SHOOTER.

252
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,614
EVERY SILO OF GOVERNMENT, THOSE

253
00:10:00,615 --> 00:10:02,383
CHILDREN WERE LET DOWN.

254
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:04,151
THEY WERE FAILED.

255
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:06,487
AND THAT CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN IN

256
00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:06,821
FLORIDA.

257
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:10,291
>> Martha: COMMISSIONER, SOME

258
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:11,826
HAVE SUGGESTED THAT EVEN A SILO

259
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:13,928
OF GOVERNMENT THAT YOU OVERWATCH

260
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:16,163
HAD SOME BLAME, BECAUSE THE

261
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:17,965
BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM, THE

262
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:19,367
COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT YOU OVERSAW

263
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:23,237
WAS DOWN FOR A FULL YEAR, AND

264
00:10:23,238 --> 00:10:25,339
DURING THAT PERIOD IS WHEN THE

265
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,675
POLLS SHOOTING OCCURRED.

266
00:10:27,676 --> 00:10:31,713
HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT?

267
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:37,485
COUNTRY WHO PUT THOSE CONCEALED

268
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:39,754
WEAPONS LICENSES THROUGH THREE

269
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:40,588
DATABASES.

270
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:41,723
TO OUR CRIMINAL BACKGROUND

271
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,557
CHECKS.

272
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,360
THE THIRD IS FOR NONCRIMINAL

273
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,562
OFFENSES.

274
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,564
DRUGS, MENTAL ILLNESS, AND

275
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,565
MIGRATION ISSUES, DISHONORABLE

276
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,767
DISCHARGES FROM THE MILITARY.

277
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,438
WHEN I LEARNED WE HAD AN

278
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:57,272
EMPLOYEE THAT WAS NOT DOING

279
00:10:57,273 --> 00:11:04,446
THEIR JOB, I HELD THAT EMPLOYEE

280
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:04,846
ACCOUNTABLE.

281
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:07,449
AND YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT

282
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,617
SOMETHING THEY NEVER PUT PUBLIC

283
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:10,786
SAFETY AT RISK BECAUSE THAT SAME

284
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:12,955
DATABASE PREVENTED THEM FROM

285
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:14,256
PURCHASING A FIREARM AT THE

286
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:14,990
POINT OF SALE.

287
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:16,558
SO FLORIDIANS ARE SAFE.

288
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,393
THE INDIVIDUAL WHO LED US DOWN

289
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:20,596
IS NO LONGER WITH MY DEPARTMENT,

290
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,197
AND I HELD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE.

291
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:23,999
THAT’S WHAT LEADERS DO WHEN YOU

292
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:27,970
YOU DISCOVER THE PROBLEM, YOU

293
00:11:27,971 --> 00:11:30,372
INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM AND YOU

294
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,574
HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE.

295
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:32,775
THAT IS WHAT RICK SCOTT HAS DONE

296
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,577
FOR FLORIDA AND THAT IS WHAT I

297
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:39,782
WILL DO AS GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA.

298
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:40,583
>> Congressman DeSANTISL0:

299
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:42,385
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT ANSWER IS

300
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:44,220
THOUGH, HE DIDN’T ACT LIKE A

301
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:45,554
LEADER, HE COVERED IT UP.

302
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:47,523
IT WAS TO COVER DISCOVERED BY

303
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:49,158
THE MEDIA.

304
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,326
WHEN GOVERNOR SCOTT FOUND OUT

305
00:11:50,327 --> 00:11:51,527
ABOUT IT, HE SAID IT WAS

306
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:53,229
DISTURBING THAT NO ONE HAD TOLD

307
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:53,963
HIM.

308
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,965
IF YOU WERE A LEADER, YOU WOULD

309
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,400
HAVE TOLD THE GOVERNOR SCOTT AND

310
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,267
GOVERNOR SCOTT WOULD HAVE COME

311
00:11:58,268 --> 00:11:59,769
OUT PUBLICLY AND SAID, THIS IS

312
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,570
WHAT HAPPENED.

313
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:02,572
WE HAD TO FIND OUT FROM NEWS

314
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:05,775
LEADERSHIP.

315
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:07,577
I BELIEVE IN TRANSPARENT

316
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:08,177
LEADERSHIP.

317
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:09,812
YES, THINGS HAPPEN IN AN AGENCY

318
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,416
LEVEL WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND

319
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:15,852
BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

320
00:12:15,853 --> 00:12:19,622
AND NOT TRY TO COVER IT UP.

321
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:20,623
>> Bret: COMMISSIONER?

322
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:21,357
>> Commissioner Putnam: I HELD

323
00:12:21,358 --> 00:12:23,293
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE AND I HELD

324
00:12:23,294 --> 00:12:24,227
MYSELF ACCOUNTABLE.

325
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:26,496
I WENT BEFORE THE PRESS AND

326
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:27,497
ANSWER QUESTIONS UNTIL THEY RAN

327
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:28,431
OUT OF QUESTIONS.

328
00:12:28,432 --> 00:12:29,633
WE HAVE PUT SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE

329
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:31,468
TO MAKE SURE THIS DOESN’T HAPPEN

330
00:12:31,469 --> 00:12:32,469
AGAIN.

331
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,938
AND KEEP IN MIND, THE REAL ISSUE

332
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:37,240
HERE IS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE ON

333
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:39,609
THE LEFT WHO WANT TO TAKE AWAY

334
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,877
YOUR GUNS.

335
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:42,179
WHO WANT TO UNDERMINE THE

336
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,348
SECOND AMENDMENT WHILE MAKING

337
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:50,854
LEADERS ADMIT WHEN YOU HAVE A

338
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:53,924
BREAKDOWN IN YOUR PROCESS AND

339
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:56,794
YOU FIX IT, AND YOU MOVE ON, AND

340
00:12:56,795 --> 00:12:57,628
YOU MAKE FLORIDA A STRONGER,

341
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:04,401
THOSE TWO BACKGROUNDS AND HAS

342
00:13:04,402 --> 00:13:08,606
WEIGHED OUR TWO RECORDS, AND

343
00:13:08,607 --> 00:13:13,177
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS FIRMLY IN MY

344
00:13:13,178 --> 00:13:13,477
CAMP.

345
00:13:16,982 --> 00:13:18,983
SHERIFF’S KNOW THAT I WILL BE

346
00:13:18,984 --> 00:13:20,785
THE BEST GOVERNOR TO KEEP

347
00:13:20,786 --> 00:13:23,454
FLORIDIANS SAFE, TO PROTECT YOUR

348
00:13:23,455 --> 00:13:24,221
LIBERTIES.

349
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:24,922
TO ELIMINATE THE GANG

350
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:25,590
ACTIVITIES.

351
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:28,259
TO CRACK DOWN ON THE OPIOID

352
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,794
CRISIS AND TO PROTECT OUR

353
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:31,596
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IN THE

354
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:31,929
PROCESS.

355
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,764
THAT’S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

356
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:36,768
[APPLAUSE]

357
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:38,369
>> Bret: LETS TURN TOPICS TO

358
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,371
THE ISSUE OF TRADE.

359
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:41,806
CONGRESSMAN, A STUDY ON TRADE

360
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:43,374
ESTIMATES THAT FLORIDA COULD

361
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,776
LOSE NEARLY 25,000 JOBS AS A

362
00:13:44,777 --> 00:13:47,512
RESULT OF THE STEEL AND ALUMINUM

363
00:13:47,513 --> 00:13:48,346
TARIFFS.

364
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:50,815
THE EUROPEAN UNION JUST ANNOUNCE

365
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:51,583
RETALIATORY TARIFFS TARGETING

366
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:55,353
GOODS SUCH AS ORANGE JUICE AT

367
00:13:55,354 --> 00:13:55,720
25%.

368
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:58,523
SO IS PRESIDENT TRUMP’S TRADE

369
00:13:58,524 --> 00:14:02,794
POLICY GOOD FOR FLORIDA?

370
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:03,561
>> Congressman DeSANTISL0: I

371
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:05,764
HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE IN THE

372
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:06,398
CONGRESS FOR GETTING MORE

373
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,400
FUNDING FOR SOME OF OUR PORTS,

374
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:09,401
LIKE IN JACKSONVILLE BECAUSE I

375
00:14:09,402 --> 00:14:11,369
THINK THAT CAN BE AN ECONOMIC

376
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,604
DRIVER.

377
00:14:12,605 --> 00:14:14,973
BUT HERE’S THE THING YOU HAVE TO

378
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:15,607
UNDERSTAND.

379
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:16,608
DONALD TRUMP WROTE THE ART OF

380
00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:18,210
THE DEAL.

381
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:19,211
I TALKED TO HIM ABOUT THIS AND

382
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:20,812
HE DOES NOT WANT TO SEE HIM AND

383
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:22,981
STATE WHERE WE HAVE HIGH TARIFFS

384
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:24,816
ACROSS THE BOARD BUT HE ALSO

385
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:25,484
LOOKS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND

386
00:14:25,485 --> 00:14:27,319
SAYS WE HAVE OTHER COUNTRIES

387
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,687
THAT SELL GOODS TO US AND WE

388
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:30,756
DON’T CHARGE MUCH OF A TARIFF,

389
00:14:30,757 --> 00:14:32,624
AND YET WE CAN’T SELL SOME OF

390
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,159
OUR PRODUCTS THEY ARE.

391
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,927
SO HE’S LOOKING AT THAT

392
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:36,729
IMBALANCE AND SAYING HE WANTS TO

393
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,597
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

394
00:14:38,598 --> 00:14:39,765
SO IF HIS NEGOTIATING ISN’T

395
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:41,667
WORKING, I THINK HE WILL TRY

396
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:42,134
SOMETHING ELSE.

397
00:14:42,135 --> 00:14:43,602
THIS IS NOT THE DIRECTION HE’S

398
00:14:43,603 --> 00:14:47,172
GOING TO SAY WE WANT HIGH

399
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:48,574
TARIFFS, HE’S TRYING TO GET

400
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,375
CONCESSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE

401
00:14:49,376 --> 00:14:50,509
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I THINK WE

402
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,578
SHOULD GIVE HIM THE CHANCE TO DO

403
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:53,712
HIS THING.

404
00:14:53,713 --> 00:14:56,749
HE IS THE MASTER NEGOTIATOR.

405
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,552
B6 EVEN IF IT’S PAINFUL IN THE

406
00:14:59,553 --> 00:15:00,219
SHORT TERM?

407
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,987
>> Congressman DeSANTIS: I

408
00:15:04,891 --> 00:15:09,395
BUT I ALSO THINK, IF YOU LOOK AT

409
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:10,763
WHAT CHINA HAS DONE, THEY STEAL

410
00:15:10,764 --> 00:15:11,564
OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND

411
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:13,199
THEY CHEAT ON OUR DEALS, AND WE

412
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,369
ARE JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE IT’S

413
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:16,969
HUNKY-DORY.

414
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,504
AND TO DONALD TRUMP’S CREDIT, NO

415
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:20,239
ONE ELSE WAS WILLING TO TALK

416
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,407
ABOUT THAT UNTIL HE CAME ON THE

417
00:15:21,408 --> 00:15:23,409
SCENE AND HE IS LEADING WITH

418
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:23,943
CONVICTION ON THIS.

419
00:15:23,944 --> 00:15:26,379
SO I WANT TO SEE FLORIDA WITH

420
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,847
INTERNATIONAL TRADE ACROSS ALL

421
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:29,649
OF OUR GREAT PORTS BUT I ALSO

422
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,284
WANT TO HAVE FIRE DEALS FOR ALL

423
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:32,485
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I

424
00:15:32,486 --> 00:15:34,654
THINK THAT’S WHAT

425
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,388
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRYING TO DO.

426
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:38,792
>> Martha: ALONG THE SAME

427
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:39,592
LINES, COMMISSIONER PUTNAM, YOU

428
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:41,528
SEEM TO ECHO HIS TOUGH TALK ON

429
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:41,995
TRADE.

430
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:44,164
HE TALKED ABOUT THE MEXICAN

431
00:15:44,165 --> 00:15:45,498
STRAWBERRY GROWERS HAVING AN

432
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:46,967
ADVANTAGE OVER THE U.S. FARMERS.

433
00:15:46,968 --> 00:15:49,603
BUT NOW AS YOU SAY, CHINA IS

434
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:53,607
THE OTHER THINGS.

435
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:54,775
EXPERTS WERE AMERICAN FARMERS

436
00:15:54,776 --> 00:15:56,576
ARE IMPACTED HERE.

437
00:15:56,577 --> 00:15:58,612
SO AS FLORIDA’S TOP AGRICULTURAL

438
00:15:58,613 --> 00:16:00,647
OFFICIAL, DO YOU SUPPORT OR

439
00:16:00,648 --> 00:16:07,221
OPPOSE THIS TRADE WAR?

440
00:16:07,222 --> 00:16:12,626
>> Commissioner Putnam: I WAS

441
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:14,161
THERE WHEN I FLORIDA SIGNED A

442
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:15,996
BAD DEAL THAT PUT FLORIDA

443
00:16:15,997 --> 00:16:17,564
RANCHERS AND FARMERS AT A

444
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:18,799
DISADVANTAGE AND PUT THEM OUT OF

445
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,199
BUSINESS.

446
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,402
I HAVE SEEN THIS UP CLOSE AND

447
00:16:21,403 --> 00:16:21,769
PERSONAL.

448
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,705
THE HAND-WRINGING THAT HAS BEEN

449
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:27,408
GOING ON ABOUT A TRADE WAR.

450
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:29,176
CHINA HAS BEEN IN A TRADE WAR

451
00:16:29,177 --> 00:16:32,913
AGAINST THE UNITED STATES FOR

452
00:16:32,914 --> 00:16:34,381
DECADES, AS HAS MEXICO.

453
00:16:34,382 --> 00:16:36,517
THEY DEVALUE THEIR CURRENCY,

454
00:16:36,518 --> 00:16:38,619
THEY STEAL OUR TECHNOLOGIES.

455
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,788
I HAVE SEEN -- GO BACK TO RUSKIN

456
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:42,990
AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER.

457
00:16:42,991 --> 00:16:48,196
I CARE MORE ABOUT THE JOBS IN

458
00:16:48,197 --> 00:16:51,399
RUSKIN THEN WHAT’S GOING ON

459
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,167
IN -- IT HASN’T EVEN BEEN

460
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:54,469
ENFORCED TO AN EXTENT THAT

461
00:16:58,607 --> 00:16:59,574
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE FIRST

462
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:14,856
PRESIDENT TAKE ON THE TRADE WARS

463
00:17:14,857 --> 00:17:16,791
WHO WILL BENEFIT AMERICAN

464
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,326
WORKERS, FLORIDA WORKERS,

465
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:21,363
FLORIDA BUSINESSES AND FLORIDA

466
00:17:21,364 --> 00:17:23,565
FARMERS.

467
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:24,766
>> Bret: GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU.

468
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,402
>> Martha: NOW MOVING ONTO THE

469
00:17:27,403 --> 00:17:28,403
ISSUE OF ENTITLEMENT.

470
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:29,571
COMMISSIONER PUTNAM, STAYING

471
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:30,806
WITH YOU ON THIS ONE.

472
00:17:32,575 --> 00:17:33,175
GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT FOR

473
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:34,576
EXPANDING MEDICAID BECAUSE IT

474
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,814
YOUR RECORD ON ENTITLEMENTS

475
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,816
AGAINST YOU THIS FALL.

476
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:42,784
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO ALMOST A

477
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:44,620
QUARTER OF FLORIDIANS WHO DEPEND

478
00:17:44,621 --> 00:17:47,856
ON THOSE PROGRAMS FOR THEIR

479
00:17:47,857 --> 00:17:48,791
HEALTH CARE?

480
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:49,658
>> Commissioner Putnam: THERE

481
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:51,894
IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THE

482
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:52,561
DEMOCRATS WILL TALK ABOUT

483
00:17:52,562 --> 00:17:53,595
EXPANDING GOVERNMENT.

484
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:54,997
THEY WILL TALK ABOUT A

485
00:17:54,998 --> 00:17:55,998
GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTH CARE

486
00:17:55,999 --> 00:17:57,399
PROGRAM AND THEY WILL TALK ABOUT

487
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,567
HOW MANY WAYS TO RAISE YOUR

488
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:01,403
TAXES TO PAY FOR IT.

489
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:03,606
I’M AGAINST THE EXPANSION OF

490
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:05,141
MEDICAID UNDER OBAMACARE BECAUSE

491
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,182
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

492
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:16,585
THERE ARE OVER 40 COUNTIES IN

493
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:18,988
FLORIDA WHO ONLY HAVE ONE

494
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:19,789
INSURANCE PROVIDER.

495
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,592
HOW IS OBAMACARE WORKING OUT FOR

496
00:18:26,864 --> 00:18:28,798
42% OF THE BUDGET.

497
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,200
MEDICAID IS ONE-THIRD OF THE

498
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:38,207
UP THE STATE BUDGET, MORE THAN

499
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,909
EDUCATION, MORE THAN

500
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,610
INFRASTRUCTURE, MORE THAN

501
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:41,611
NATURAL RESOURCES.

502
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:51,888
HAVE HIGHER PAYING JOBS, GREATER

503
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:53,390
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND GOOD

504
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:54,224
CAREERS.

505
00:18:54,225 --> 00:18:55,792
THAT’S THE REPUBLICAN PLAN FOR

506
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:57,394
STRENGTHENING OUR ECONOMY AND

507
00:18:57,395 --> 00:18:59,596
GIVING PEOPLE ACCESS TO

508
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,196
AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY

509
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:01,531
HEALTH CARE IN FLORIDA.

510
00:19:01,532 --> 00:19:03,800
>> Martha: IT LET ME ASK YOU

511
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:05,368
QUICKLY, A LOT OF STATES ARE

512
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:06,503
IMPLEMENT IN PROGRAMS OF WORK

513
00:19:06,504 --> 00:19:07,370
FOR MEDICAID.

514
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:09,606
YOU JUST MENTION HOW MEDICAID IS

515
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,208
GOBBLING UP FUNDING IN FLORIDA.

516
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:12,609
DO YOU SUPPORT WORK FOR

517
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:17,581
>> Commissioner Putnam:

518
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:18,382
ABSOLUTELY.

519
00:19:18,383 --> 00:00:00,000
IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE ON PUBLIC
