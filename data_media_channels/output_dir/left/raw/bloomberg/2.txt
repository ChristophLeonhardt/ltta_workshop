1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,460
The Netherlands is known as a cyclists paradise.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,240
Its safety levels, one of the best in the
world,

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,320
are in staggering contrast with the US,

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,640
where you’re around 20 times more likely to be injured while riding a bike.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,420
In the Dutch capital nearly half the working
population

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,220
commutes daily on over 500 km of dedicated
cycle paths.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,220
But the city only narrowly avoided

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,380
being taken over by cars.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,920
Here’s how Amsterdam put the brakes on cars

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,300
to give bikes a chance.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,659
Following the Second World War, the mobility and

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,880
affordability of cars started changing people’s lives.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,809
Neighbourhoods around the world were being
flattened

14
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:40,539
to make way for busy highways.

15
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,769
“Chicago is moving a city”

16
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:44,479
“New York striving to keep abreast

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,540
of the ceaseless teeming traffic”

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,100
Amsterdam wasn’t going to be left behind.

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,660
Streets, once considered public

20
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,479
space in the Netherlands, were changing.

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,180
Their new function was purely for traffic.

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,320
The number of bikes in Amsterdam plummeted.

23
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:03,010
Between 1960 and 1970 the number of cars in
the country quadrupled,

24
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,000
jamming the traditionally narrow streets.

25
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,930
Engineers and city planners wanted to modernise

26
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,220
Amsterdam to make it more car-friendly.

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,410
They proposed ideas like; filling in the famous
canals with concrete,

28
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,480
levelling historic neighbourhoods, and building
expressways and monorails.

29
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,520
This is what Amsterdam would have looked like
in 2000

30
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,840
if the Das brothers had realised their futuristic vision.

31
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,300
Unsurprisingly, there was opposition.

32
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,290
Anarchist group Provo came up with the world’s
first bike and car sharing schemes.

33
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,810
They didn’t take off at the time, but the
sentiment to keep Amsterdam light on cars

34
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,520
was shared.

35
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,380
Dutch road fatalities peaked in 1972.

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,500
In response, protest groups like Stop De Kindermoord,
or “Stop Murdering Children"

37
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,740
were organising blockades of areas with high
accident rates to make their point.

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,960
Then, in 1973,  the oil crisis sent fuel
prices skyward, prompting the Dutch government

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,100
to ban motor vehicles for one day a week.

40
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,060
“Reaction here to the Sunday motoring ban
has been mixed.

41
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,479
The unions and the hoteliers are angry and
annoyed.”

42
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,740
But the sales of bicycles started to rise.

43
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,100
Pressure groups jumped at the opportunity
to show citizens how Amsterdam could look

44
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,080
without cars.

45
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,200
The government took notice and in 1978 introduced
the Traffic Circulation Plan

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,560
to make Amsterdam less attractive to drivers.

47
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,340
It called for the closure of certain streets
to traffic, reduction in car parking spaces

48
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,100
and gave priority to cyclists and pedestrians.

49
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,620
Amsterdam started embracing ‘Woonerf’
-

50
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,030
or ‘living streets’ - a concept that was
already successful

51
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,980
in reducing traffic casualties outside of
the capital.

52
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,200
The specially designed zones are landscaped
to slow drivers down.

53
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,159
Without sidewalks, drivers share the space
with cyclists and pedestrians and have to

54
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,600
move at walking pace.

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,920
Making Amsterdam more bike-friendly was really
about making the city less friendly for cars.

56
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,080
Now, almost a quarter of the Dutch population
cycles every day,

57
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,980
with 75% of children cycling to secondary
school.

58
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:18,299
The number of cyclists on the road also makes
it safer -

59
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,740
research shows a correlation between higher
numbers of bikes and lower casualties among cyclists.

60
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,000
If Amsterdam’s story is anything to go by
 - there is not only safety but also power

61
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,239
in numbers.

62
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,080
Just as important as cycling lanes and car
controls,

63
00:03:34,160 --> 00:00:00,000
is getting people on bikes in the first place.
