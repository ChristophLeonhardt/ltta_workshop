Donald Trump this past weekend once again said something incredibly stupid on Twitter a lot of people compared it to Regina George from the movie Mean Girls when Donald Trump tweeted out basically saying why would Kim jong-il call me Kim jong-un call me old I would never call him short and fat which was Donald Trump's snide way of calling Kim jong-un's short and fat now keep in mind these are two mentally unstable world leaders who both potentially have access to nuclear weapons so in response to Donald Trump's asinine tweet chief of staff John Kelly was interviewed in Vietnam where he's travelling with Donald Trump about Donald Trump's tweets and how they affect his staff to which Kelley replied I don't let our staff our White House staff uh check Donald Trump's tweets I do not let them pay attention to what Donald Trump is tweeting out and I don't either so Donald Trump's chief of staff the entire White House staff according to the chief of staff is not allowed to see some of the crazier things that Donald Trump puts out there on Twitter for the entire world to see now don't you think that that's something these people should know about if if their boss the guy they're working for in the White House is out there antagonizing a mentally unstable North Korean dictator don't you think they should know about that if their lives are gonna be in danger because of the stupid that Donald Trump says on Twitter don't you think they should pay attention don't you think they might should be on guard a little bit instead of just going about their day thinking everything's fine meanwhile the president's potentially raged tweeting us into another war no you cannot ignore Donald Trump's tweets because as he said himself and as Kellyanne Conway has come forward and said on behalf of the President that's his preferred method of speaking to the American public these things are essentially presidential records at this point you cannot ignore them pretending that they aren't there does not mean that they are not there and the rest of the world is judging this entire country by what they see and Donald Trump's Twitter feed the least you could do John Kelly is one either take the damn phone away from Trump and stop him from tweeting or to at least allow your staff the entire White House staff and even yourself to see how insane the man that these people are working for truly is and then maybe they can make educated decisions about whether or not they want to remain within his staff if you're thinking about subscribing to our channel I strongly encourage you to do that but if you're not thinking about subscribing I would encourage you to start thinking about it and then once you're thinking about it actually go and do it you can see the subscribe button right there on the screen or if you're watching on a different platform go to youtube.com slash the Ring of Fire
