take a look at this 1929 painting by Emily Carr it has inexplicably becoming a lightning rod of controversy not due to anything on the canvas mind you but thanks to the title of this artwork namely Indian church yes apparently Indian is the new n-word when used to describe native so naturally because this is 2018 this painting has been renamed to prevent any progressive snowflakes from experiencing a meltdown historical revisionism is defined as the reinterpretation of the historical record it was something that became a dark art form under the tyrannical rule of Stalin during the darkest days of the Soviet Union but now revisionism is being practiced by self-proclaimed goody two-shoes on the progressive left these days barely a month goes by when the call goes out to remove a statue of someone who no longer passes the PC sniff test and so it is according to a CBC report that the Art Gallery of Ontario has scrubbed the word Indian from the painting Indian church after all curator Georgina bull Iraq says Indian is a word that causes pain how does that word cause pain who is in pain from hearing that word if the curator is implying that the native population is collapsing on mass at the mere mention or sight of that word then she is certainly doing that segment of the population a grave disservice in any event the painting is now called Church at you quit village which is the name of the BC indigenous community where the church was located but really in tangible terms does such virtue signaling really accomplish anything there are problems big problems on many Canadian reserves but does anyone of any political stripe think that renaming a painting that was rendered almost a century ago is going to solve any of those problems and who truly is upset over the paintings original name our individual natives really losing it over a piece of art called Indian church I mean really I think it's prudent to separate the full outraged voice by predominantly white progressives and the official spoke Sinise who head up native organizations case in point do you recall that 2016 poll commissioned by the Washington Post that went out exclusively to American Indians to gauge their opinion on the Washington Redskins name and logo more than 90 and of Native Americans had no problem with the name and the logo and kudos to the posts for actually publishing the results rather than burying the data because surely this was not their desired outcome of this poll now I wonder what other AI names face the acts in the days ahead especially given that this is the last year for the Cleveland Indians chief wahoo logo can we expect I don't know Indian motorcycles to be towed away to the scrap heap of obsolescence indeed just to be on the safe side folks if you happen to be in the northern hemisphere and you experience a period of unseasonally warm and dry weather in either autumn or spring time please please refrain from referring to this climatic condition as Indian summer wouldn't want to trigger some sensitive progressives after all for the rebel dog media I'm David the men's Lloyd Menzies hey folks Saturday June the 2nd is fast approaching that's the date of the annual rebel live event in Toronto Katie Hopkins Sheila Gunn read John Cardillo the big bossman is relevant we'll all be there go to the rebel live.com and buy your tickets today you
