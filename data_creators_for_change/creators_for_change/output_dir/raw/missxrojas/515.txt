25
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,710

33
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,210
this more than anything miss you

34
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,530
experience has made me realize that I

35
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,810
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of belong there or in a city or</font>

36
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,100
something I didn't I think I have to

37
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,780
keep going with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world finding places</font>

38
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,450
and until I find someone that makes me

39
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,189
feel whether London<font color="#E5E5E5"> did Chicago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> came</font>

40
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,259
pretty close<font color="#E5E5E5"> i very much like shikaka</font>

41
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,320
and but<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking of big cities and you</font>

42
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,470
know economic hubs and that sort of

43
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,430
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't wait around</font>

44
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,259
conversation I've been reading this book

45
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,030
for the past three<font color="#CCCCCC"> months or so good</font>

46
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,130
affluenza by oliver james there's a new

47
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,020
who follow me on<font color="#E5E5E5"> twitter which you</font>

48
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,759
obviously will should because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

49
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,189
come out with little gems of wisdom<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I</font>

50
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,439
date well<font color="#E5E5E5"> there that recently I've had a</font>

51
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,509
small obsession with oliver james who is

52
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:40,710
I think a psychologist or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

53
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,850
psychoanalyst or I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

54
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">difference between them burn I'm gonna</font>

55
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,090
say that one of them anyway that he

56
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,220
writes articles for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Saturday</font>

57
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">Guardian I think the family section</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

58
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,759
but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Guardian</font>

59
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,740
website and enter his name is search him

60
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,060
but he wrote this book quite a few

61
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,090
answer and it's all about how selfish

62
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,070
capitalism's like forcing us into

63
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,490
emotional distress and just how empty

64
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,259
our consumerist<font color="#CCCCCC"> LiveScience grace</font>

65
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,149
absolutely fabulous it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 500 pages</font>

66
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,639
long I mean clear to turn really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad in</font>

67
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,139
the party under page so it shouldn't

68
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,700
really be talking about it until I've

69
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,720
read<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole thing but</font>

70
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,130
really gives a crap because I've learned

71
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,330
loads of interesting stuff already in

72
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,490
the first 300<font color="#E5E5E5"> pages my dad loves</font>

73
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,310
self-help books<font color="#E5E5E5"> like loves them this</font>

74
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,070
whole it has I would say at least one

75
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,780
book shelf thought of self-help books

76
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,940
things like pure bliss which i think is

77
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,880
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and the secret which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

78
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,140
actually makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick my</font>

79
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,390
fingers down my throat because its just

80
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,430
oh I suppose like the law of attraction

81
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,200
but they just repackaged it but into a

82
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,310
book that looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> The Da Vinci Code</font>

83
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't really a secret and it</font>

84
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,830
capitalized the one where it's just

85
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes me really angry and stressed and</font>

86
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,100
talk very quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> but hey more than</font>

87
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,810
self-help books I like helpful books and

88
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,120
I think that affluenza is a helpful book

89
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,890
to read even if you don't agree with all

90
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,530
it says just read it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yeah about it</font>

91
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">how it's gonna make us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all just very</font>

92
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,720
unhappy and comparing the people who are

93
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,170
happy people who aren't and in the in

94
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,270
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the world he's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> written a more</font>

95
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,190
recent book this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was written in 2007 his</font>

96
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,500
russian movies look I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> updates in</font>

97
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,570
2010 called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Britain on the couch which</font>

98
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,790
is just focus on Britain but I think I

99
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,230
probably read after but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

100
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,270
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> general grand scheme of things</font>

101
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,280
and first but he's written those books

102
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,890
as well so can<font color="#E5E5E5"> poke around and find this</font>

103
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,130
I'm so<font color="#CCCCCC"> excited to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go home and literally</font>

104
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,560
just thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about like you know having</font>

105
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,880
a tubes that aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> being able to go</font>

106
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,209
wherever I want within reason and just

108
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,350
come which I did it doesn't seem very

109
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,610
likely because there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of snow</font>

110
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,470
across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UK right now here we've got</font>

111
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,110
trench of rain and I think at home it's

112
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,880
really really cold and damp but I'm

113
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,430
