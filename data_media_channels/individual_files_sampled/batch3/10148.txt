hey I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report peace brother you know we're all about peace peace and loves not like there's other channels that promote war and weapons and hey I love you the question is if Lockheed Martin wanted to give you a hundred million dollars to place an ad in between these segments yeah they call me all the time I know I did I'm only into love bombs just let them let love everywhere mmm nourish all right well you know what something amazing happened in the past week or so and you know we're gonna skip the like the the fast breaking headline news who cares about the markets going up or down right we don't care about that we care about the fact that after eight years in office and now he's two years out of office Barack Obama who remember he passed that thing called Affordable Care Act haha funniest name ever right of course because it's the unaffordable Care Act if you haven't been here so he was out on the campaign trail helping Democrats and what he said is that we need Medicare for all oh really which everybody was telling him at the time when he was doing deals with a big pharma and the big hospitals and the big insurance companies well I want to look at one story coming from those with Medicare okay here's what Medicare for all might mean in the context of how our system works here soaring bankruptcy rates signal quote a coming storm of broke elderly study finds three of people 65 and over filing for bankruptcy grew nearly two hundred and four percent from 1991 to 2016 a study published by the social science research Network found and the percentage of seniors among all US bankruptcy filers increased by nearly five times over the same period researchers looking at data from the consumer bankruptcy project found that high health care cost combined with reduced incomes and a widespread decline of pensions are all contributing the growing trend of financially broken retirees so it's health care cost is the number one thing we'll get into that data ok health care costs are killing people yes that's that is correct so a Barrack Obama of course remember he took Dennis Kucinich up in the plane the Air Force one Dennis Kucinich wanted to do health care no Medicare for all Medicare for all yeah Anna back Obama put the shoulder lock on them and then came a few nuggies and they didn't decided no they're not gonna do he back down now it's important and we're not going to be able to go into it but there's there are many ways to do single-payer you know and you just look at Europe there they have single-payer for the most part universal health care but it you have the difference like the United Kingdom even the doctors and hospitals work for the government to save France where they're all it's similar to here Medicare for all there but rates are not extreme here so elderly once you hit 65 you go on Medicare yeah so the these are the costs medical costs are frequent tipping point for older bankruptcy filers to study found although Medicare is a great start for covering seniors health care cost many people don't realize that it doesn't cover everything long-term care hearing aids most dental treatment eye exams for glasses and foot care for the many things Medicare Part A and B plans do not cover Medicare can also involve co-pays coinsurance and deductibles that may be difficult for some seniors on reduced incomes to afford in fact a study by fidelity found that the average 65 year old retiring and entering Medicare will need two hundred and eighty thousand dollars in health care costs before they pass away 280,000 edition of genetic Medicare yeah medicare covers a lot more but you will need to if you have any money if you're not on Medicaid if you're not you don't qualify for Medicaid and that's for poor people you will have to come up with two hundred and eighty thousand dollars so this is something to also keep in mind when you hear those numbers about oh my god the average American the baby boomer entering retirement only has like fifty thousand dollars in savings probably because they start to think well if you have three hundred thousand dollars in savings well two hundred and eighty thousand is gonna go to the doctor so you might as well just apply for Medicaid you might as well just be spend all that to into the need thousand get be poor enough to get Medicaid and Medicaid will cover everything so the way to make a billion dollars obviously it would be to take Dignitas which is the Swiss suicide clinic and I franchises available all across America so that enhance towns and Hamlet's from coast to coast Dignitas which is an established suicide clinic can take patients who can no longer afford health care in America and go quietly into that long night this a huge billion dollar play and I don't see why not it's not as if the government is not asking people to commit suicide it's not as if suicide rates in America are not already skyrocketing okay why are they going up so fast it's because people realize that the government's trying to kill them so why not just make money on it look at the mick suicide you know McDonald's can get into give me a give me a coke of fries and kill me you know for $9.99 you know why not a Jeff besos can have a suicide drone come to your home and shoot you dead for like 12 bucks right I mean I'll deliver that why not there was a moment when Stephen Fry of course she was a famous British comedian lives in Britain so has the free health care system there no no cost at at point of views where he did a cross-country trip in America and he ended in New York City and he he interviewed this taxi driver while he was in a yellow cab in the back and he happened to get to the point where he asked the guy what you know what when he planned to retire and the guy said retire I can't afford to retire my retirement plan is a bullet to the head that's the way to go that's the American Way so another remarkable statistic here is out-of-pocket health care costs for Americans on Medicare ate up 41% of the average Social Security income in 2013 the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation no relation to this Max Keiser those costs are expected to rise to 50% of the average Social Security income by 2030 that it found I just love these stories because to me like having lived in Europe for 20 years and seeing that there's actually like 300 million people in Europe I've already figured out how to make this system work where you don't have to have this absurd elaborate folk Octus system of this elaborate system of you know forcing people to go bankrupt and all the stress and and taking all they're considered a human right okay continental Europe you know in France and Germany you know I think the UK is kind of a special case we won't talk about it at this time but in France certainly it's considered a human right to have access to affordable health care for real through your throughout your life because yeah the idea is that the government the state the person that you give taxes to they have a few responsibilities one would be to protect you against let's say foreign invaders the other one would be give you some transportation options to get around yeah another one would be okay we're going to make health care affordable for you you know we're a huge buyer you know it's amazing that in America people will join a Groupon group to save nine dollars on sushi with their friends on Groupon and using the group affected by health care but if you said you know why you apply that Groupon logic to health care so that you can afford health care and it won't make you bankrupt they're like the socialism I would never but that they get all because they've been trained by the professional media hypocrisy industry and propagandists who run the big media outlets for people to have a trigger response to affordable health care equals communism and they their little sphincters get it all puckered up okay so you can hear it all across America three hundred millions fingers oh my god it's called meters so you know I mean while they're gonna check into Dignitas and blow their brains out for 12 bucks to make Jeff Bezos a dollar so speaking of communism that's in the headlines today as well on my next headline here and apparently with the the new the neo communist of our modern world China money talks and is certainly talking Spanish these days Latin America says US has itself to blame for Chinese entry into region that it opposes the Trump administration announced last week that it was at least temporarily pulling its ambassadors out of El Salvador and Dominican Republic and the charged affair out of Panama after the three countries broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan in an effort to get closer with China a US trade adversary China doesn't recognize Taiwan's independence the Trump administration is saying that the China's signature one belt one road is actually just a debt like system and they're just gonna load you up a debt and take your your assets and your infrastructure but leaders across Latin America largely shrug their shoulders at American warnings they need cash for infrastructure projects they need new roads telecommunications equipment and energy systems and China is willing to provide it in ways that the United States has not people want the infrastructure they want simple things they want health care you know they want these sort of things and like our masters of the universe our elites are the people who live in DC in New York and these bubbles they can't understand why the people outside their bubble want this things like a road a train health care a promise and you have a system based on a Ponzi scheme and a fiat money like you have an America with a central bank of the US dollar it's a like a Bernie Madoff where you need ever more gouging of those around you to support those at the top or as Frederic Bastiat famously said in one of his famous 18th or 19th century books that if it's looting at the top expect looting at the bottom and so America is basically a loot aa cracy it's run by looters by looters for looters and everyone down the down the ladder is equally looting in in their own regard in the case of health care because the patients are right there look there's no reason why any of these health insurance companies would start just harvesting people's kidneys for five dollars if they sure that's coming they'll be like here's a coupon for a five dollar off on your next kidney removal that we need to help pay the bill that we just sent you for no reason Tim Geithner sent you a kidney you know coupon to get five dollars off your next kidney removal normally like a different model that offers more benefits and like a better system like normally like you know if you're if American travels to Europe like we did and we live there we see that the health care system there is way better not even just like a little bit better it just is so much less stressful so much less bureaucratic so much easier don't think about it and you don't think about it it's easy it's just a simple thing it's like a utility side water yeah you don't think of and then you come here and it's so time-consuming so thick with paperwork and just insanity and overpriced right so it makes better senses here on the geopolitical geo-economic scale here's a quote from an unnamed ambassador who wanted to remain anonymous a diplomat from one of these latin-american countries who of course did not want to be killed by the Emperor for saying such a thing but he says or she says quote you left some space ie America did and the other guy moved in a Latin American diplomat told McClatchy speaking in anonymously so he could more freely discuss the relationship with the United States and China quote the region will work first with the people who bring the money show me the money and and I'll deliver right I stopped a show it's about peace and love in America equates war and hatred with love America kills people for love and the China is building infrastructure for people for love there's a big difference and people are there infrastructure for love built and have their heads blown off by America for love building yeah I think you know you can look back for the last two three thousand years and one can see that Empire is only an empire can act violently only they could act with hubris only they can shoot you in the head and take your money and leave because they're the ones that are always exceptional and they're the ones with the shining like city on the hill they're the only ones that always allowed to do it with its Rome or Spain or Britain or the United States the we're the only ones that can get away with it right now so China doesn't have that option if they went in and threatened these nations it would be you know UN would meet and be like how can China threaten El Salvador you know you we can't they can't do it so they have to go and with money like that they're going in with is America's money that they gave China be it when they shop at China Walmart think about that for a second China is using your money anyway we got to take a break and when we come back there's gonna be a whole lot more don't go away welcome back to the Kaizen report I'm Max Keiser time to turn to Dominic Thomas of warbly dot IO we're a FinTech and blockchain meet Dominic welcome thank you thanks for having me max what is warbly so where Blees a compliant financial services blockchain really at its core supplying meaning we're bringing in the AML kyc verification for users I look very heavy as if you've undergone some stress is this ICO is this the crypto market and is it is it tough to keep stay in the game these days well we're not we're not trading yet so we're still in you know development stage we're launching our network on November 1st so we don't have to worry about the bear market too much we're privately funded just just building out the network and in getting our user account ready okay so my understanding of warbly is that you are trying to solve the problem of the fact that the user interface for a crypt that was terrible you know I'm thinking back in the 90s back in the 90s the internet was hard to navigate and then in 1997 Netscape went public I think was 1997 and suddenly had the browser and that was really the beginning of the internet boom as we know it because it suddenly was easy for people to get on with encrypted with Bitcoin it's not easy at all to get into this space it's pretty difficult so is this am i right is that part of what you're trying to do is to make it more user friendly absolutely we we see it as you know when when you're explaining crypto right now to a friend or a family member and trying to get him engaged it's it's kind of a manual process at this point you know you have to sit down with them or get on the phone and talk about wallets and private keys and we're just thinking that we don't see how that scales but we want to preserve the sort of core values of cryptocurrency the the transparency and all those things that come with it so we think that we're taking like an intermediary step right so I know in the case of AOS the user interface is very difficult very popular crypto out there and many still don't know how to vote for a block producer like us fish rocks for example is one that Stacy and Max are involved with and what are your thoughts on this in terms of put in these terms you know Steve Jobs and Wozniak were a pair and woz was kind of the tech guy and Steve Jobs was kind of the marketing guy you know I don't think he wrote any code in his life so you know we lack a Steve Jobs and I look at the landscape in crypto for example there's a cruise featuring a debate with people that support Bitcoin cash versus Bitcoin but they seems to be 180 degrees removed from what's happening why this is an important industry they've lost it they've lost the plot what do you think about that statement I do I think that there's a lot of people in the industry that aren't really thinking about how people are gonna actually use blockchain rights is what we talked about is most people don't understand the internet they don't know what's going on in the back end they're just logging into Facebook they want to be on Facebook they don't they don't care about servers and switches and you know same thing no one's gonna care about the blockchain people are not gonna get educated on what it distributed you know ledger is you know immutable like they don't care they only care about what is it gonna do what what kind of apps are gonna come out how is that gonna impact their life how's it gonna make things better you know hopefully what are the value propositions and so to us we know in the industry that blockchain can do a lot for people but until they can access it easily and safely securely right blockchain is about freedom freedom of money and that's great and we'll preserve what we're calling like the manual option so for the advanced crypto user you want to hold all your own private keys do all that stuff great absolutely we're gonna have an insured wallet option for somebody who wants to not deal with that and have insurance and not have to worry about their private key and insured wallet options okay so the all these wallets and exchanges that the problem has been they've been hacked Oh going back to mount cox hacked and there's been many exchanges and wallet systems that have subsequently been hacked so you got an insurance company to vacu with an insurance product for your wallet is that correct or how does that work exactly we have an underwriter that we've been working with that's going to offer an insurance policy it's part of the procedures that we're creating so the fact that users are well adjusted they have to go through I mean is it the first insured product of its type I think so I'm not aware of anybody else who's one of the first certainly an innovator pioneer so I mean the insurance industry would be loath to get involved with this because this is part of the maturation of this asset class now if you've got insurance companies coming in and saying this is insurable that's pretty significant yeah in terms of respect given to this as an asset class and so what tell me more what else what other features you got going over there what else is happening part of the insurance is that there needs to be security right they want to know what their downside risk is so we're going you know publishing our security protocols with them and in public - to everyone but there's going to be auditing of daps on our chain for security you know what what measures are they taking or not we have a what's called a pen testing company penetration testing that we're working with that will kind of white hack applications on the chain to make sure that they're safe because this is all of the things that insurers want to see they just don't understand blockchain they're going to insure it eventually but most companies don't understand it the other features are in the user account we'll have you know sort of a dashboard where people can access the apps and the AML kyc data will always be private to the user controlled by the user but the DAPs can who require this type of compliance will query the user and the user can decide whether they want to release that they are in fact verified and so there's there's kind of a whole interchange here but we hope that this experience for a user will feel like a Google account does right now and then you can click to Google Play you can look at all the apps for your Android or whatever how old is this company about nine months so we started January and so and you say your financed you funded you're funded what's the headcount there well interestingly it's not that high we have about 30 people on the team and they worry about project of everywhere everywhere right so I'm here with people in New York West Coast London Hong Kong Australia do you have to engage in any jurisdiction shopping in other words a lot of crypto companies like you know why we got to be in Switzerland we got to be in Malta we got to be in this country because that's where they like that's what they want is they want to see how they want us there are you looking at that in those terms absolutely so what do you fund we're forming a foundation we're gonna use Singapore we think was kind of Singapore or Bermuda we pick Singapore because of the FinTech you know they have a FinTech base they have a lot of to have a lot of developers right our developers at some point they were holding companies hostage they were saying like we're developer you need to pay us a lot of money and the market was very tight is that still the case or because of the crash in crypto is the price for developing and coming down I think we've been fortunate that a lot of people who are blockchain and a kind of evangelists and innovators see the need for what we're doing so we've had developers who are willing to work for our token at this stage yeah but you know what I found is that developers are really nice for a while until they're not and then suddenly they're like you know what they hold a I have the keys your tech and I'm giving me a lot of money or I'm gonna blow town you know they're they're not credit they're not credible people for them what I found for the most part they're kind of scoundrels have you found that to be true no not yeah I hope I don't have to find that out ICO is a college friend of mine so I've known him for over 20 years mmm that helps and you're connected to a house in some way yeah so I was part of the team that helped develop one of the first or the first iteration of the worker proposal system and we just put out our sort of bid to the community to see if they like what we did worked with Thomas Cox on that and some other folks in the community for the last six months so he's out there competing with ëthere iam and card on oh and these other platform coins why why do you like e else if you like it why do you like us versus all the other coins you have a thought on that yeah so we looked at a lot of block chains well the idea was right we wanted to bring financial services to the blockchain what blockchain should we use and that was kind of a january/february experience and yos first and foremost the transaction speeds I think everybody understands that its fastest in the industry right now as far as I now are close to but account recovery is critical meaning the this this way in which US has this ability for me to designate Max Max was my good friend I trust you if I lose my private keys I can call up Max and there's a process and a procedure to recover that with a sort of a real-life person like a trustee and is a smart guy you know he's behind me out he's behind steam he's behind another one bitshares bitshares and this kind this idea of concentration in the network is one where bitcoin they say well it's distributed but you know what a lot of miners are kind of dominating and Asia and is it as distributed as we really wanted to be distributed and so you know he seems to have distressed that with yose with his designated blockchain producer for state delegate a proof of stake I should know because I'm involved in one of these things so so that's been up and running for a while what's the verdict so far I I think it's fairly distributed as far as if you're looking at things like geography would be the example and delegate a proof of stake like are we representative of global regions but there are some issues I don't think anybody would lie that into the voting there's probably some block producers who the community you know are kind of just backed by some whales and have a lot of votes and maybe aren't great I've heard that one of the block producers whose typically in the top five in standings is extremely slow and fairly technically behind we've seen some of that but it's really there's a little bit of friction there push back in terms of maybe some political shenanigans going on a bit but the idea is that if you have I think there's 21 block producers are in the main group and then there's voting this continuous and so there's just like this continuous kind of like rolling democratic process that is trying to weed out the weekends yeah and it seems to have done that so far thinking I think that the the 21 block producers seem as a whole to be fairly robust I agree and they're down to almost 50 paid positions now so in the backups so the 21 or your main producers and then there's backups who are voted they have to get at least point five percent of the vote for their their block producer team and so you know we're out 250 block producers that are actively being paid to secure the network and engage and so what aren't you gonna be in a year from now what's the gilt goal for you sook we here for now five years from now what where do you want to be so a year from now we hope that there's I hope at that point dozens and dozens of you know decentralized applications running on chain that our user base that has grown to we're projecting hoping to meet a goal of a million in the first year users the the net the second wave will be the challenge that'll be when we get I think outside of the existing blockchain community and start bringing in the people that don't know much about blockchain but can hear about us through our marketing and PR this this account that's easy to use and then applications that are driving people to it you know that's really the goal is to just keep expanding that out alright Dominic Thomas of warbly dot i/o thanks for being on the cars report thanks for having me all right well that's going to do it for this edition of the Kaiser report what's me Max Keiser and Stacey her but we want to thank all right gas Dominic Thomas of warbly wor bli dot IO if you want to catch us on twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye y'all
