well I think that the 4.5 billion was spent largely to keep everybody quiet to make this issue go away to say hush up Alberta look we're keeping this pipeline alive even if Kinder Morgan was gonna kill it and sort of a nudge nudge wink wink to environmentalists too with their inaction not with the 4.5 billion dollar purchase but the fact that they're not doing anything with this pipeline that they just bought it's kind of a hush up environmentalists we're on your side and we're not gonna move on this pipeline so the other day Shannon Stubbs who is the natural resource Shadow Minister for the Tories in Ottawa asked Jim Carr who is the natural resource minister for the Trudeau government oh hey how's that pipeline coming you know you you bought this pipeline and you said you were gonna go ahead with it one of the reasons you bought it was Kinder Morgan said it couldn't stand another missing another construction season construction seasons underway is the pipeline underway and Carr said well no there's some problems with the permitting process it's been lots lowered we thought not sure when the pipeline's gonna get started so that that makes it to me look like they're really not that serious about making about building this pipeline why did they buy it you know there's there's been discussion about whether or not they overpaid for the pipeline and Kinder Morgan's existing pipeline the company value that 2.5 billion we paid 4.5 billion is taxpayers in their most recent regulatory filings Kinder Morgan Canada listed their assets as 4.6 billion so that we got all those assets maybe we didn't overpay but the point is we bought the pipeline to make sure it was going to get built so that we wouldn't miss this construction season and we're gonna miss this construction season because the Liberals are too timid to actually do anything concrete with this pipeline watch an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including all two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
