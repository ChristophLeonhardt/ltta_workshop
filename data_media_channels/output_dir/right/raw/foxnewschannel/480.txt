1
00:00:02,108 --> 00:00:03,176
THIS FBI INVESTIGATION COULD

2
00:00:03,176 --> 00:00:06,246
HAVE STARTED A LONG TIME AGO.

3
00:00:06,246 --> 00:00:07,581
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP TONIGHT

4
00:00:07,581 --> 00:00:10,851
DIRECTING THE FBI TO DIG INTO

5
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:12,085
KAVANAUGH'S BACKGROUND FOR A

6
00:00:12,085 --> 00:00:14,087
SEVENTH TIME, SAYING, QUOTE,

7
00:00:14,087 --> 00:00:17,757
I'VE ORDERED THE FBI TO UPDATE

8
00:00:17,757 --> 00:00:19,693
KAVANAUGH'S FILE.

9
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:21,127
THIS UPDATE MUST BE LIMITED IN

10
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:22,996
SCOPE AND COMPLETED IN LESS THAN

11
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:24,364
ONE WEEK.

12
00:00:24,364 --> 00:00:27,300
DOJ PROSECUTOR IS HERE TO

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,668
SEPARATE FACT FROM FICTION ABOUT

14
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:29,469
HOW THIS IS REALLY GOING TO

15
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:29,870
WORK.

16
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,203
OKAY.

17
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:33,507
SO THE FBI, LET'S TALK ABOUT

18
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:35,208
THIS.

19
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,878
SHANNON, A WHITE HOUSE

20
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:40,681
CORRESPONDENT SAYS, A NOTE ON

21
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:44,051
WHAT THE FBI CAN OR CAN'T DO.

22
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:45,986
THEY CAN'T SUBPOENA RECORDS OR

23
00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:47,387
FORCE ANYONE TO TESTIFY.

24
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:48,588
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?

25
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:51,125
>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

26
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:59,299
MISCONCEPTIONS.

27
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:02,469
THE FBI WILL GATHER FACTS.

28
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:03,971
NOW, NORMALLY THIS IS DOWN FAR

29
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:05,606
PRIOR BEFORE WE GOT INTO A

30
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:07,307
PROCESS LIKE THIS, WHEN THINGS

31
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:08,675
ARE STILL CONFIDENTIAL.

32
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:10,310
THE FACT IS THAT NOW WE'RE

33
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,080
TIPPED OFF TO THESE ALLEGATIONS.

34
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,115
THE FBI IS KIND OF A HYBRID.

35
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:16,717
YOU'RE RIGHT.

36
00:01:16,717 --> 00:01:17,484
NO SUBPOENA AUTHORITY.

37
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:18,852
THEY CAN ASK QUESTIONS, THEY CAN

38
00:01:18,852 --> 00:01:20,521
ASK FOR STATEMENTS, THEY CAN GET

39
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:24,191
SOME RECORDS, BUT AGAIN, THERE'S

40
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:26,293
NO PHYSICAL OR FORENSIC EVIDENCE

41
00:01:26,293 --> 00:01:27,561
HERE, THERE'S NO ELECTRONIC

42
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:28,262
EVIDENCE HERE.

43
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:30,197
IT'S FAR TOO OLD FOR THAT.

44
00:01:30,197 --> 00:01:32,766
THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO BE

45
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:36,236
LIMITED TO ABOUT HALF A DOZEN

46
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:37,871
PEOPLE, LARGELY WHAT'S ALREADY

47
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:40,240
BEEN DONE BY THE SENATE.

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,210
>> EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS GIVEN

49
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,545
SOME KIND OF STATEMENT.

50
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:46,246
TONIGHT WE'RE HEARING FROM

51
00:01:46,246 --> 00:01:49,716
SEVERAL OF HERE AGAIN WILLING TO

52
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:50,751
PARTICIPATE.

53
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:51,752
NPR SAYING THIS.

54
00:01:51,752 --> 00:01:54,188
THE FBI WILL NOT GIVE ITS OWN

55
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:54,988
DETERMINATION ABOUT THE

56
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:57,424
TRUTHFULNESS OF WHAT WITNESSES

57
00:01:57,424 --> 00:01:57,691
SAY.

58
00:01:57,691 --> 00:02:02,196
THEY OPPOSED ACTIVATING THE

59
00:02:02,196 --> 00:02:02,930
BUREAU.

60
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,331
INVESTIGATORS PROBABLY WILL ONLY

61
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:05,799
CONDUCT INTERVIEWS AND PASS THEM

62
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,735
ONTO THE SENATE.

63
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:09,002
>> WE'RE GOING TO COME FULL

64
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:09,336
CIRCLE.

65
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:10,404
LET'S SAY AN INVESTIGATION IS

66
00:02:10,404 --> 00:02:12,106
BEING DONE OF ME BECAUSE I'M

67
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:15,008
BEING NOMINATED OF SOME

68
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:15,376
POSITION.

69
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:17,711
THEY TALK TO MY CHILDHOOD

70
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:19,546
FRIENDS AND THEY SAY I COMMITTED

71
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:22,850
ARENA ACT BACK THEN.

72
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,585
THEY MAY TALK TO PEOPLE, BUT

73
00:02:24,585 --> 00:02:26,320
THEY WON'T TRY TO PROVE OR

74
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,955
DISPROVE THE ACT HAPPENED.

75
00:02:27,955 --> 00:02:28,756
THEY'LL TAKE THE EVIDENCE TO THE

76
00:02:28,756 --> 00:02:31,492
SENATE AND SAY, "HERE YOU GO,

77
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:34,328
BUT YOU THE SENATE HAVE TO MAKE

78
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:35,562
THE DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR

79
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:37,431
NOT THIS IS CREDIBLE AND WHAT TO

80
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:39,767
DO WITH IT.

81
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:45,072
>> WHAT ABOUT A ONE-WEEK

82
00:02:45,072 --> 00:02:45,572
TIMEFRAME HERE?

83
00:02:45,572 --> 00:02:47,808
DR. FORD'S ATTORNEYS ARE SAYING

84
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:51,011
THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY

85
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:53,814
ARTIFICIAL GUIDELINES OR

86
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:54,448
RECONTRIBUTIONS ON THIS.

87
00:02:54,448 --> 00:02:56,484
IS THAT DOABLE?

88
00:02:56,484 --> 00:02:58,452
>> WHETHER OR NOT IT'S GOING TO

89
00:02:58,452 --> 00:03:03,090
PACIFY THE MINORITY, AND THAT'S

90
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,928
ANOTHER QUESTION ENTIRELY, I

91
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:09,330
GUARANTEE VERY LITTLE WILL COME

92
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,732
FROM THIS INVESTIGATION.

93
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:13,501
IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THEY WILL ADD

94
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:15,403
MUCH TO THIS PROCESS.

95
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,570
WHAT IS VERY LIKELY IS THAT

96
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,972
WHATEVER THEY FIND WILL BE

97
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:19,941
REJECTED BY THE MINORITY AS

98
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:20,374
INSUFFICIENT.

99
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:21,976
>> LYING IS A BIG PROBLEM.

100
00:03:21,976 --> 00:03:22,677
>> BIG PROBLEM.

101
00:03:22,677 --> 00:00:00,000
SAME AS LYING TO THE SENATE.
