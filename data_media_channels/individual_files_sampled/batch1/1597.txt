hello I'm hasn´t seeker this is counting the cost on al-jazeera your weekly look at the world of business and economics this week some of the world's biggest technology names out with earnings but there's a face-off with regulators in what's being called a tech lash also this week a golden era that's how the UK and China want to see their partnership but those golden fruits may prove difficult to harvest with brace it in the way plus I'm Wayne hey reporting from southern Thailand where we'll tell you about an ambitious coast-to-coast project that could have a major impact on shipping and security now some of the world's biggest technology names posted earnings over the past few days Facebook Apple Amazon alphabets and Microsoft produced quarterly revenues of around a hundred billion dollars altogether and that's likely to continue back in 2013 the economists predicted a looming tech lash in 2018 Internet giant's are under the microscope over the way they do business new data privacy rules will go into effect in the EU in May Germany is already investigating how Facebook uses the data from millions of its users the u.s. is looking at whether Apple broke laws with software updates which slowed older iPhones and Congress is holding more hearings on the use of social media platforms to allegedly disrupt US elections consumers too are asking if things like smart phones designed to keep us online for longer or just making companies richer at the expense of children's mental health so joining us now from New York is Daniel i's chief strategy officer and head of technology research at g bh insights thanks very much for being with so let me ask you there has been something of a backlash though against many of these tech giants a tech lash if you will as as we've been saying there's the whole issue of facebook and the all of the fake news that was allowed on their platform and and that they haven't been doing enough on that there's issues of privacy as well users and what their information is being used for and so on what sort of effect is that gonna have on on the industry and how is how what are they doing to address that are they doing enough to address it yeah it's not a big of fact if you look since the rush of meddling feek news it's really now you're seeing a lot more heat on facebook on Twitter an alphabet not just here in Capitol Hill but also in the EU and abroad and they really had to change a lot of their especially for Facebook the news feed they've really that's been a big moneymaker for monetization perspective so we're talking a few billion that was potentially a risk because they've made the move now for users to see Wes will call it advertising and more from friends and family they're definitely in the crosshairs of regulators and I think you see in Twitter as well as alpha and YouTube they're gonna be a lot more strict and a lot more focus than some of the content that's coming through as we're seeing the double-edged sword of social media the positives but also the negatives and they're right front and center in terms of the crosshairs of Capitol Hill you mentioned there what's authorities in Europe have been doing there there is we saw European regulators not not being shy about pushing back against tech giants we saw that with Apple and its tax payments the antitrust fine against uber what happens with Google as well and some of their businesses business practices do you think that the tide is turning now in terms of greater oversight of these companies and we are we gonna see more of that in the US as well yeah I mean that continued sort of boxing match between Silicon Valley and the EU is getting I would say it's getting more intense you know part of it just like you said they focused on Apple you've seen focused original Microsoft but now you are seeing stricter potential for regular tour oversight I think part of it is that these companies need to play nice in the sandbox as I'll call it they need to show to have olive branches out to EU I think you've seen that with Facebook in terms of some of their changes to the tax code and what they've done in Ireland and I think you're gonna see more of that as they're gonna have to sort of outreach more than you as it looks like you know they are looking to get a lot more stricter especially in the privacy stuff and that's why you're seeing a lot of these social media companies Facebook Twitter outfit in particular on YouTube trying to be more proactive now in terms of privacy content because they know coming down the pike there's a there's more potentially oversight coming and that would be a major issue for the business model you talk there about these companies needing to play nice in the sandbox as well what is what does that look like to you should there be more more transparency more data sharing perhaps and less of the kind of what we're seeing of bullying competitor ISM on search results and news feeds and that sort of thing yeah I mean look the reality is is that these companies at this point basically own I'll call the consumer Kingdom you could call it streaming on Netflix when you look at social media to advertising it is really Facebook Google and you could say Twitter a little further down the road did that own it so I don't think their core business model is changing but I do believe transparency I think a lot more oversight around content I mean Facebook said they're gonna stop crypto advertising and get coin advertising that's an example of just like they're like look if this could be an issue we're gonna take it off now of those in the near term effect the model right you're talking billions of dollars and say a risk but they need to do it because the last thing they can do right here is have another we'll call it news Russia meddling situation happen which would really put more heat in the kitchen form so they're gonna be a lot more proactive and look they're gonna have to spend what's called combine another 50 hundred million on security on content on people on regulatory potential issues in order to make sure that these things don't affect their business model they need to put guard rails around and make sure they're being more proactive than reactive interesting times in the tech industry will be keeping a close eye on what does happen thanks very much Daniel lives in Germany opposition MPs are demanding answers from the government about a scandal involving well-known car makers and diesel fuel tests a research group funded by BMW Daimler and Volkswagen reportedly forced volunteers and monkeys to inhale toxic exhaust gases the VW suspended one of its senior executives after the public outcry over the secret test Dominic Kane has more from Berlin this unfolding scandal involving three of Germany's largest car manufacturers Daimler BMW and Volkswagen has profound implications not just for the motor industry but also the closeness of the relationship between the German government and the motor manufacturers let's remember the importance of the German car industry the automotive industry to the German economy very important generates a great deal of revenue every year creates many many jobs in this country which explains why the government's successive governments have sought to have a close relationship the point also to make here is the motor manufacturers have tried to distance themselves from the tests that have taken place have deprecated them condemned them said that that could never happen again but underlying all of this as I say is the perception of what is happening in the motor industry let's be clear ethics certainly raised its head regarding the dieselgate scandal the devices the defeat devices that were created to allow the cars artificially to pass emissions tests well those have not faded from people's minds now the question people are asking is well how far does this idea of trying to get around rules doing things that might not be ethical how far does that extend and also there are some environmental lobbies saying well we that the government successive governments are too closely aligned with car firms and they want some kind of break up of that some kind of distancing to go ahead I still to come on counting the cost it's not only the financial markets that are booming I'm Rob McClendon the biggest market in traditional Chinese medicine that's going through the roof now Myanmar's economic prospects with the West are at risk after mounting international criticism over its handling of the Ray hinge of crisis Scott high-low reports from Yangon as the bustle of Yangon City winds down at the end of the day people streamed to the Riverside to commute to feed the seagulls and to soak in the last bit of light before sunset and when the Sun rises in a new day starts a reminder has arrived overnight another cargo ship from Myanmar's main trading partner China also a reminder of the dependence on its huge neighbor to the north something leaders here hoped would lessen when economic sanctions began to soften eight years ago but with mounting international criticism and pressure over the rehén jet crisis the nation seems to be turning its focus away from new partners in the West I think given the justified anger on the part of the international community in the UN instead of handling that criticism and dealing with the crisis in Rakhine in a professional political and moral manner the government just decided we'll just go back to the Chinese this new factory on the outskirts of Yangon supplies Myanmar rubber to tire manufacturers up in China it's about 70 percent of their business they want to expand to the west but this deepening rift between Western nations and the government here might force companies like this and the nation to remain reliant on trade with China Myanmar drew harsh comments from the US last week when it announced the government would buy six advanced su-30 fighter jets from Russia and they wear Ginza when was a political prisoner during military rule he says the timing of the fighter deal in closer military ties with Russia are related to the reinjure crisis after what happened in Rakhine and the discussions at UN Security Council are China and Russia flatly said that they would support a mo so this is something that I'm your mom military especially knows that it can count on analyst David Matheson feels that even though the two nations are providing for Myanmar now investments in defense assistance there's a long-term problem they do in a western donors because the Chinese and the Russians aren't going to provide health and education initiatives they want to sell weapons and they want to extract natural resources right now most of the people of Myanmar are not aware of any negative impact that the Rohini crisis might bring but some think that there will be a cost if there's further distancing from the international community and that could impede the progress of reform after years of isolation panama has its famous canal the suez canal cuts through egypt and now there's a plan to resurrect a 400 year old sealing in the south of Thailand the waterway would link the Indian Ocean and Andaman Sea with the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea Wayne hey traveled to see kau home to a coastal community during the wet season Thailand's Andaman Coast is often dark and moody tourists go home leaving local fishermen to ply their trade in relative peace but life could become a lot busier if a proposed shipping canal cuts through here some welcomed the prospect of investment while others doubt their lives would change for the better when it comes to mega projects that's never the people who benefit it's only the rich people big people from Bangkok who get more rich from it and never get anything and the government never helps at the moment ships sailing between Europe and China for example travel through the dangerous and congested malacca strait often stopping in singapore to refuel or unload before continuing the Thai canal would cut more than 1,000 kilometres off the journey but could drastically cut in to Singapore shipping trade the backers of this canal proposal have many problems to overcome not least of which is the location between here and the Malaysian border there is a separatist movement with armed Muslim groups fighting for independence from Thailand in the three southernmost provinces if the canal goes through here it could create something of a border and therefore embolden their claim because of the violence in the south Prime Minister Prayuth chan-ocha says he's reluctant about effectively cutting the country into supporters of the plan which includes some Thai business leaders and retired generals believe they can convince the Prime Minister to at least agree to a feasibility study he has to I come to the understanding that this is the project that will stimulate our economy faster than any other projects that we have right now the canal group says it has private sector support from China to help pay the estimated price tag of 30 billion dollars but it really needs Chinese government backing if it's to tap into Beijing's one belt one road economic and trade initiative to link East and West so far there's no sign of Chinese government money in the proposed Canal Zone is already concerned about the potential impact on tourism the environment and livelihoods our lives depend on this ocean this is our home this is where we find food people will start to come and take what belongs to the locals more people means more trash this place will no longer feel like home instead this sleepy coastal community could become one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world our Britain's Prime Minister has been in China this week talking trade as the UK looks to forge new partnerships for when it leaves the European Union the China will want to see what a final brexit deal looks like for making any big commitments there's a great deal at stake for both countries as Adrian Brown tells us Britain's relationship with China is complicated by history this is the remains of Beijing's old Summer Palace ransacked and looted by British and French troops more than a hundred and fifty years ago Chinese people are taught not to forget it we're in Santa Barbara so we should try every way to get these things back from Britain there are all China's national treasures they're ours Britain should return the things they've looted from China because they belong to China as she embarks on a three-day tour of China Theresa May will have larger concerns than historic grievances she's here on a mission to increase British trade with China that need is growing quickly following Britain's decision to leave the European Union she should have tried to convince Chinese leader that she's okay and her government he's okay and he will she can you know provide any I mean effort to have a stable and a smooth sprack seat and especially with doing the practice braclet process there will not be any negative impact on China Britain relations thirteen billion dollars worth of trade deals were signed on Wednesday significantly the prime minister said in spite of her earlier reported reservations Britain would now cooperate with China on its one belt one Road initiative President Xi Jinping's pet project a joint media conference with China's Premier Li Keqiang was dominated by questions about Britain's future after brixon we're determined to ensure that we get the best brexit deal for the United Kingdom and that means it is it will be a deal that will ensure that we take back control of our money of our laws and our borders but we're also able to maintain a good trading relationship with the EU for the future because that is good for both the United Kingdom and for the European Union do you hope you no matter what changes may happen in the UK's relations with other parts of the world China will remain committed in its policy of developing friendly relations with the UK and I have faith in the brighter prospects of China UK Thais Theresa May won't be going to Hong Kong the former British colony returned to China more than 20 years ago and we're calls are growing for her to address concerns about threats to political reform judicial independence and human rights Mae said that a so-called golden era in relations had now intensified the outcome of her visit will determine by just how much for joining us now from Hong Kong is Jean wushu a senior economists for natixis in China he's also an associate professor at Beijing Normal University thanks for being with us now I want to ask you first of all then how challenging is it going to be for the UK to get a good trade deal with China at this point it's going to be you know not as easy as people may think about it actually for the UK after Bob breaks it it needs to go through a lot of procedure to say any contracts any trade deals with the third country first it is to settle it's a brexit deal with the European Union before that it cannot even tisk discuss about the multilateral tariff scheme under the W framework so it's that is most difficult part after they took the still tongue the sub recs a deal with the European Union it can start to talk about them with the WTO and the other issues and after that it can start to talk about the bilateral preferential agreement with the third country so just a timeline for that and technically but and even for China if the UK does not settle down it's such specs a deal with the European Union cannot oh do not want to involve itself too early into the negotiation you talked a little bit there about how China is going to be viewing this and and now they're gonna be closely watching these brexit negotiations talk a little bit more about that and and and what what's in this for China particularly in its trade relations with the UK what's at stake for them the golden era between UK and the China was established while China was still part of while the UK was still part of with the European Union so China viewed the UK at the BRICS through into the European Union so that's the main target for China but the following brexit the UK was not part of the EU and any you know any efforts that China can make to get a better access to the UK may not offer a better access to the EU so the attraction made from the UK is actually less so for China at the moment so that's basically the general framework China faces when negotiating with the UK it's less attractive for the moment so let's look at possible scenarios then if there is what's called a hard break sit for the UK where UK just leave the European Union without without a deal with the EU and presumably reverse to WTO regulations what's that gonna mean for China then for China with rising you know become anti-globalization atmosphere everywhere and the China definitely is a friends and especially from the developed world and the most likely friend for China at that time is the UK who is shearing the golden eater with China so both countries have the intrinsic need to move on the air you know warm relationship with each other but for China's use realistic point is that it's used the year 27 I think more definitely more important than the UK it's not only because of the GDP because of the trade because the EU is actually the only power in the world can help China to bear as a more aggressive United States in fact that China has started to negotiate with the EU about a bilateral investment agreement from a very early stage but the just the progress is for the moment and slower than expected alright January Xu thanks very much for being with us thank you now scientists in the West have long disputed the therapeutic value of traditional Chinese medicine but it seems the ancient craft is gaining popularity at home and abroad it's even been hailed by Xi Jinping's government as the gem of Chinese science Rob McBride reports on the country's biggest traditional medicine market in the city of Bozo where business has never been better it's early and the trading hall is packed wholesale buyers pick over the pulls of the plants animal parts and minerals that are the basis for traditional Chinese medicine borders placed here set prices across China so it's you've been a trader for 20 years has only seen those prices go up I've seen tremendous changes over time this ingredient used to sell at 16 dollars for half a kilo now it's 30 times that at 475 dollars on the same handle treated as a pseudoscience by many for its followers and that includes most older Chinese it guarantees good health and increasing popularity abroad is not lost on China's leaders looking for soft power cultural exports to support China's growing international status traditional Chinese medicine has been given the best type of tonic with support from President Xi Jinping who's described it as the gem of traditional Chinese science and the Communist Party has been pushing for Chinese medicine to be given equal status with modern Western medicine but while many doctors agree that traditional medical principles and beliefs have a value they warn against using ancient remedies that could do more harm than good if you're taking the medicines used by the ancient Chinese they may contain things that are harmful to your health that's different from traditional medical theories back in the trading halls in Bojo such concerns are largely dismissed ancient remedies they say can exist happily alongside modern medicine don't see what the two are complementary you can go to a hospital to get modern treatment but traditional medicine works well in prevention this has become a belief for people with that belief comes increasing spending power to ensure the market for those potions keeps on booming and finally US crude is back the International Energy Agency saying earlier this month it expects American production to surpass Saudi Arabia climbing above 10 million barrels a day in 2018 and that is something we'll be looking at in next week's show but that is our show for this week get in touch with us by tweeting me at housing seeker and do use the hashtag a
