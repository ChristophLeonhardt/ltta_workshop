what is triggering communal violence in sri lanka muslims say they're being systematically targeted by the Sinhalese buddhist majority the government's declared a state of emergency but what will it take to end the recurrent religious friction long term this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Rochelle Carey a nationwide state of emergencies being enforced in Sri Lanka to prevent attacks on Muslims Buddhists mobs set fire to homes and businesses killing young Muslim the riots followed the death of a Sinhalese truck driver the unrest is a repeat of rioting four years ago and since then there's been rising tension between communities a varied mix of ethnicities and religions make their home on the island or the 26-year long civil war ended in 2009 guitar guests in a moment first though bunnell Fernandez reports on the Central District a candy a heavy military presence deployed to keep the peace witnesses say organized mobs from the single majority targeted mosques Muslim homes and businesses on Monday afternoon Mahmud fa√ßades brother Abdul died in their burning home one of many satellite early-morning today I came to inside the house for check with my parents so that time I saw my brother he was well down in the floor near the bathroom the attacks were sparked by the death of this man hd Kumar Singh her the 41 year old Singh Holly's driver was beaten by four reportedly drunk Muslim youths for not allowing them to overtake his vehicle days later he was dead Muslims were attacked on the day of his funeral after 30 years of brutal conflict Sri Lankans don't want more violence but amid increasing nationalist sentiment promoted by hardliners minorities are feeling vulnerable President Maithripala Sirisena acted to address those concerns imposing a state of emergency I express my deepest regret and pain to every family and relative who suffered the loss of life and property and I strongly condemn all acts of violence I've also asked the police to strictly enforce the law against whatever group individual or organization that was behind the unrest Sri Lanka has had a violent past helping form many theories on why and is happening today boils down to in a way the belief that the majority has that they own the country and all others outsiders some observers say police and Special Task Force personnel couldn't control the mobs that ran right in bigger Antonia on Monday and the state of emergencies aimed at preventing similar incidents senior minister Mangala summer Veera has said enough is enough calling for inciting racial violence to be made a non-bailable offense and politicians who lead such violence to be stripped of their civic rights min FN an des al-jazeera digna sri lanka sri lanka is a diverse country with different ethnicities different religions around three-quarters of the 21 million islanders are Sinhalese who lived mainly in the southwest it's estimated 70% are Buddhists less than 20% of Sri Lankans are Tamils who mostly follow the Hindu religion they're divided into two groups Tamils a Sri Lankan origin in the north and the east and Tamils with Indian roots in the south and center of the island other minorities include Muslim Moors Malays Vedas and Christian Berger's who are descendants of European colonial settlers let's bring in our guests now joining us from colombo via skype tiaki ruin party rihanna a legal adviser and human rights activists and an oxford Gehan gana tilaka legal director of Verte research in sri lanka and welcome to you all thank you for joining us let's let's start where things are right now which is this state of emergency that has been called for that is being enforced giaggi is is this the right answer to get this under control at least right now do you think so it's a difficult call and I think it's something that we can't judge right now because we're not in the ground we're not in we're not in any capacity to check if the violence is so much that the government hasn't been able to respond to it using normal methods of law enforcement it's I mean it's a case to be made that it's just that sustained inaction have led to this point and not taking enough action on perpetrators or having enough convictions in the past has involved in these perpetrators which has got us to the current situation so it's a call for government it's difficult to gauge at this point whether the state of emergency was called for a dot it also it remains to be seen in what they do and how human rights are protected in this current situation and actually that that's I'm glad you brought that up Tok that's a question I was going to put Gihon what what concerns if any do you have about what might happen during this state of emergency particularly as it pertains to human rights I think we have had a troubled past with emergency in Sri Lanka we've had a state of emergency for a very long time while there was a war going on and for several years even after the war so the state of emergency in Sri Lanka is naturally looked upon with suspicion so I think there are concerns that this state of emergency will be extended beyond what is absolutely necessary as the ADI said I think it's a call that is difficult to make it may be something that is necessary in the short term but certainly it is something that we in the past have had for a very long time where it was not necessary and leaders governmental officials have exploited emergency in the past to violate human rights alongside the state of emergency we also have news coming up that social media platforms are being blocked so now these are also indicative of a government agenda to not only focus on the perpetrators on the street but also look at wider opposition and I think this is something dangerous so why the state of emergency could be necessary in the short term it will certainly be viewed with suspicion in terms of the human rights implications particularly on freedom of speech the ability to oppose government and criticize government even in terms of its response to the violence that we are seeing at the moment so giaggi to the to the point that eaat is making so you know there's the state of emergency now and it's not really clear what the parameters are are you concerned that if at whatever point this this state of emergency is you know it's over that is there any type of checks and balances to pull back some of these extra powers or law enforcement have right now so far what's being said is that this is almost like a surgical intervention it's for a limited time period and the government has apparently given instructions to police and the army to make sure that human rights is central and that their actions are proportionate things like that but we've like you had mentioned I mean we have very given our past it's difficult to sort of be alright with a state of emergency it should come as a shock and a general law enforcement issue that that's Excel escalated so much is naturally an issue and these these attacks we've seen since 2014 in Alec Amidon last year November in given Tata then last week in Ankara and now in candy and in various areas and clearly it's spreading the human rights concerns it remains to be seen because it's also about what checks and balances are restricted what there's a lot of concern so and the government hasn't communicated any of this sofa to the public and like Han said whether it's absolutely necessary to go on restricting communication method social media platforms those are very critical things the government has done which could have been avoided we are going to bring in an additional voice in this conversation right now also in Colombo via skype is Alan Keenan senior analyst and Sri Lanka project director at the International Crisis Group thank you for joining the conversation for us Alan you have said that you think the the previous president Raja puska condoned previous incidents of anti-muslim violence over the years and what way well of course he would deny that but um the ability of the vote Obama Sina and other groups to commit violent acts and hate speech for months and months for really for two full years to campaign to have large rallies and you know without any kind of interference I think is one indication but there's also since the departure of Mahinda Rajapakse and his government a lot of people have been telling me about the links that they experienced odubel asana and military intelligence so they were and also senior police officers a lot of information has come out about the active cooperation between the senior security officials and boda polisena so I think it's fairly well I think the evidence is pretty much there for the actions a government spokesperson actually said there were mistakes on the part of local police some of these attacks happened in front of them that's that's quite an admission so how bad is it that there is such a breakdown in trust between the police and in the communities Jihan I think that's a really good question we have to try to understand what is going on and why we're seeing ethno-religious violence persisting even with the new government installed in 2015 this government was perceived as a minority friendly government the government that many minority voters voted for so it is curious as to why ethnologist violence is persistent now there's a simple answer to this and that is impunity there were 200 incidents of violence in 2013 200 incidents of violence in 2014 we had alikum of course that they are dimensioned and these incidents in number reduced in 2015 and 16 with the new government but what the new government failed to do was actually bring perpetrators to justice and there was a culture of impunity that even the new government has played a part in extending now these perpetrators now understand that they have a sense of impunity to act without any consequences and that is that the consequences of that impunity we are seeing today so the law enforcement officials are trapped in this situation because there's something more complex going on as well which is beyond government while the government is responsible for impunity it is in a sense beyond government in terms of what we see embedded in Sri Lankan society and that is the simple fact that single is Buddhists believe that the country belongs to them they have this entitlement complex they have the ability to exercise that entitlement complex through state structures and law enforcement unfortunately is part of that state structure so in a law-enforcement structure it comes in contact and in conflict with this entitlement unfortunately law enforcement has taken a hesitant stance on this and we're seeing this happening today and unfortunately we are not able to transcend that merely looking to legal institutions for help chiaki let me let me bring you into this first of all do you agree with what Gahan is saying that basically the majority Buddhist feel an ownership of the country and as a secondary question is it's a in your opinion a small segment of the Buddhist population that is trying to stir up other other Buddhists and perhaps if that weren't the case everyone would get along is it a small minority groups stirring the pot for lack of a better phrase I agree with you hone in surprised with this entitlement complex with the single east Buddhist it's something that that actually goes all the way up to the Constitution the Constitution guarantee is the foremost placed Buddhism so that entitlement is almost enshrined in law and coming down from that I think the fact that law enforcement authorities also feel backwards when it comes to doing their job because some of these perpetrators are actually religious leaders or leaders of hardline groups sometimes we see them facing a lot of difficulty trying to take them into custody or there's a lot of dynamics at play but like you had mentioned also one thing with the cases is that while there are some arrests we rarely see any convictions they the cases seem to sort of even not proceed beyond the point of an initial statement so what happens in most of these cases is that after a period of time when it all dies down these perpetrators are released again and the case sort of stops there so we don't see a lot of convictions with using the eggs law like we can see the ICCPR Act and the Penal Code that we could bring in to deal with these issues but we see while we see that this doesn't actually play out in practice Alan to that point about there being no convictions and very little accountability would you say that that's the case also for the riots that happened four years ago and even going before that to the Civil War has there been a reckoning almost that Sri Lanka has not wanted to have has not wanted to deal with no there's been no reckoning and there's been virtually complete impunity for pretty much any political crime or crime committed by a state agent whether that's the military during the war whether that's police in police stations every day beating people up or whether that's um for perpetrators of religious violence so impunity runs deep in Sri Lanka and and there's just ample ample evidence of that and it's a shame because this government came in on a platform of the rule of law and of cleaning up corruption and of performing state institutions so that the law would be applied equally and they promised to look into a whole series of past violations and criminal conduct under the previous regime and that was one of their one of their main sort of rallying points and main sources of support but they pretty much failed across the board on that and its particular shame because they had a chance I think to to shift Sri Lanka towards a more rights friendly and democratic form of governance and also and to do it in a way that could bring together Singh Alize and Muslims and Tamils all of whom in different ways over the years have suffered from impunity and unfortunately we're now you know now it's the Muslims bearing the brunt previous it's been Tamils but it's been Singh at least before and unfortunately if things aren't changed it would be Singh of these again at some of the Exxon later stage Jihan see is the solution to this political I mean where are the voices that can that can make this change it seems that a change in leadership really hasn't made a difference so far yeah I also want to respond to allons allons comment I think it's important to acknowledge that there's been a strategic failure on the part of civil society as well I think what are the failures of civil society is its unwillingness to place accountability at the helm post wars also and also with the new government in place I think there was a large debate over sequencing and what should be as in front of what which should be privatized in terms of that sequence and often civil society was willing to place truth in in as prioritized over justice and accountability and we were often told that we should wait for prosecutorial justice when the time is right now we are reaping the benefits or the consequences of that kind of strategy I think we have to take stock of the fact that placing accountability on the back burner and trying to bide time and trying to be strategic in terms of when to bring in accountability in in terms of Sri Lanka's transitional justice agenda has now had consequences very dire consequences in terms of the rule of law and we're seeing the consequences and and the unfortunate repercussions of that kind of sequencing so I'm afraid that civil society also has to take stock and and ownership of what we're seeing here the second problem and going to your question about political solutions I think what this is indicating is that the political solution that we're seeking in terms of power sharing is really very far from being realizable if you can use that word because the singular Buddhist majority are signaling that their dominance in terms of the entitlement complex their dominance in terms of the exceptionalism that they enjoy particularly the Buddhist Buddhist clergy is not to messed around with and the moment a minority demonstrates economic success like the Muslim community or struggles for autonomy like the Tamil community or is accused of conversion like the Christian community the moment there is some kind of threat to that dominant status there is a tendency for violence to be used to reinforce that dominance giaggi how much worse do you think this can get are you concerned about it spreading right now very concerned because this all sort of started two weeks ago but actually the violence that have erupted after the funeral and especially in a notably after certain religious leaders who've been accused of incitement in the past actually visiting the funeral house and this happened over Sunday and Monday and as of even last night while this occur - in the administrative district of candy we've still seen reports of attacks and the attacks are spreading at when I checked last it had gone all the way to a coroner so now we're almost going from diggin er area through what they gamma and we can see it going almost towards Corona Aguilar but we're not sure if it'll go that's that far because there is a curfew one and the army is deployed it's also up to law enforcement and even the army to be deployed intuitively we can't always try to wait for post facto try to douse the fire we're expecting law enforcement to get intel and dispersed in a smart way Allen in addition to just the simple danger and the loss of life and loss of property Tuesday the the the market in Sri Lanka dipped to its lowest point in about three weeks so this you know obviously has an effect on the economy as well overall how what are your concerns for how damaging this could be to Sri Lanka as a country if a handle isn't gotten on this and it continues to get worse well it's potentially very damaging I mean I think curly it's a it could affect the ability of the government to go to international investors and say come to Sri Lanka this is a peaceful stable well-educated workforce a country where you can make money that's been one of the main aims of this government that's gonna be harder tourism is gonna generally suffer if if this kind of unrest continues but I think I'm headed that I think at a deeper level or a wider level it this really complicates and perhaps kills for a while the whole gamut of reforms that this government was some has been pledging and not making too much progress on a new constitution I think a hans point earlier it makes it right that that's gonna be you know hard to our to win any support for now i was already hard because the government is deeply divided and fighting among themselves but this this i think the sense of chaos turmoil distraction this kind of violence has had and also just a deeply damaging the deeply damaged sort of sensibilities of muslims and I think by implication town was looking on being reminded of just what tell me what the sing of the dominated state can do to minorities I think that's extremely damaging to trust and then the points about civil society that gahan was saying I think there's a lot of of thought the thinking that's now going on about why have things gone wrong and I think there's lots to lots of stop taking but I think the real danger is is that we're heading into a period even if the violence can be contained now which I hope it will we're heading into a period where electioneering and political jockeying is going to take over and any real possibility of performing institutions is is really slipping by much too quickly Tiago you'll get the final question here how concerned are you is Allen talks about and you know elections coming that politicians will just try to manipulate or capitalize on this situation to their benefit as opposed to really trying to help people it's it's already a huge concern it's less than a month since the local government elections which basically came as a surprise to a lot of people and especially given that the stock contradictions or the the disagreements between the ruling coalition and then the opposition joint opposition asking for the Parliament to be dissolved and things like that so there's been a lot of instability in the past few weeks and as a result or as a response almost the government has decided to reshuffle the cabinet and as a consequence the law-and-order portfolio has been placed temporarily it seems with current prime minister so this all is sort of happening in that context and it's almost a test to see how the Prime Minister will react to this kind of violence why he holds that portfolio so we can't ignore the context also so it's always important to keep that in mind when we should ever make a judgement for us about what how the government is reacting because it's we operate in this political context with elections coming up in the near future okay and that will be the last word and thank you for that context appreciate it very much thank you all for joining us for this conversation Thiago Rouen paddy Rana Jehan gonna tilaka and Alan Keenan
