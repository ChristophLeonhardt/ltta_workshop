A FEW WEEKS AGO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY TOM PRICE WAS FORCED TO STEP DOWN BECAUSE OF HIS USE OF PRIVATE PLANES PAID FOR BY TAXPAYERS. IT LOOKS LIKE HE MIGHT NOT BE ALONE FOR THAT MUCH LONGER BECAUSE ANOTHER SECRETARY IS INVOLVED WITH A SIMILAR ACTIVITY, LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET SOME DISCUSSION GOING AROUND THAT THAT SOUNDS NICE, I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A WEEKEND SKI GETAWAY AGAIN, OFFICIAL TRIPS, THAT JUST MEANS TRIPS YOU PAID FOR HIM TO GO ON, YET HE'S GOING OFF AND HAVING FUN WITH THESE DONORS AND RAISING MONEY FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES. IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE THEY SHOULD OUTLAW THAT OR HAVE RULES TO REGULATE IT, AND THEY DO WHICH IS A DIFFICULT CASE TO MAKE WHEN YOU HAVE LITERALLY FLOWN THROUGH THE CLOUDS ON A TICKET PAID FOR BY ME AND CENK AND JAYAR OVER THERE. THEY'VE LOOKED INTO IT SO WHILE THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO CLOUD THE WATERS BY SAYING THAT THEY HAVE LISTENED TO THE OFFICE OF ETHICS INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEY HAVE COMPORTED THEMSELVES BASED ON THOSE RULES, IT'S CLEAR AT THIS POINT THAT THEY HAVE NOT, AND A NUMBER OF THESE FUNDRAISERS HE HAS GONE TO ARE THE SORT OF EVENTS WHERE PEOPLE ARE PAYING 2 TO $5,000 FOR PHOTOS OR TO SHAKE HIS HAND, RAISING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY WHILE BEING THERE OSTENSIBLY FOR OFFICIAL BUSINESS, BUT HE SURE SEEMS BUSY WITH SKI RESORTS. FIRST OF ALL JOHN, I HAVE BEEN ON SKI GETAWAYS. I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT IN THE POST GAME BECAUSE THERE ARE FUN STORIES IN THE OLD DAYS ABOUT CHICKEN NUGGETS AND NOT PAYING FOR THE EXPENSIVE BURGERS IN THE SKI LODGE. WE WILL DO THAT IN THE POST GAME FOR THE MEMBERS, BECOME A MEMBER AND GET ALL THE POST GAMES. NOW ONTO ZINKE, IT ON ONE OF THE TRIPS HE'S LIKE I WENT TO A FUNDRAISER BUT I ALSO HAD OFFICIAL BUSINESS. WHAT DID YOU DO? I TOURED YELLOWSTONE. TO BE FAIR HE'S THE INTERIOR SECRETARY. HE'S PROBABLY FINDING AREAS OF IT HE COULD SELL TO PRIVATE CORPORATIONS. DO WE HAVE OIL HERE? I SEE SOME COPPER. HE COULD GO TO YELLOWSTONE. IF I'M THE INTERIOR SECRETARY I PROBABLY WANT TO SEE YELLOWSTONE, LET'S PUT A COUPLE OTHER MEETINGS AROUND THERE SO WE DON'T WASTE TAXPAYER MONEY SO IT'S WORTHWHILE NO, HE WANTED TO GO TO THE FUNDRAISER, HE WANTED TO FIND AN EXCUSE, I GOT IT, YELLOWSTONE IS NEARBY. LET'S WALK THROUGH THE PARK. THIS ISN'T CORRUPTION OF THE SORT WERE LIKE YOU PAY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO GO TO A FOOTBALL GAME JUST TO LEAVE AND GIN UP RACIAL STRIFE IN THE COUNTRY, IT'S NOT PENCE BAD, BUT IT'S BAD. THEY DON'T RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW. TRUMP'S SPEECH DURING HIS CONVENTION WAS WE ARE GOING TO BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER, BUT THE HATCH ACT IS CLEAR, ANYONE WHO GOES AND WORKS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE KNOWS THAT, THEY KNOW THEY AREN'T SUPPOSED TO USE TAXPAYER MONEY FOR FUNDRAISERS WHERE THEY BASICALLY GET LEGALIZED BRIBES. THEY DON'T CARE, THEY THINK TRUMP HAS BROKEN EVERY RULE AND STILL GOT ELECTED, SO KISS MY ASS, I WILL USE YOUR MONEY, I WILL TAKE YOUR TAX DOLLARS EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN SAYING MY WHOLE LIFE THAT TAX DOLLARS ARE SACROSANCT, AND I WILL RAISE MORE MONEY FOR MY BIG DONOR FRIENDS. AND RAISING MONEY FROM DONORS NOW HAS BECOME SO COMMONPLACE, FOR US IT IS STILL A LITTLE REVOLTING, YOU HEAR ABOUT IT, THESE GUYS GO COUPLES PAID $5000 TO GET THEIR PICTURE TAKEN WITH ZINKE. I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYTHING THAT'S MORE WASTEFUL THAN THAT. I TOLD JAYAR, THEY COULD HAVE SAVED MONEY, GO TO A DELI, TAKE A PICTURE WITH A GUY, SAY IT'S ZINKE, NO ONE WILL KNOW. WHO IS GOING TO CALL YOU ON THAT? WHAT THEY REALLY WANT OF COURSE IS FAVORS. WE'VE ALL GOTTEN USED TO IT, BUT EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON, WHICH IS A SWAMP, THINKS WHAT DO YOU MEAN, I HAVE TO SUCK UP WITH DONORS AND TAKE PICTURES WITH THEM, AND THEN HEAR THE FAVORS THEY WOULD LIKE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YEAH, THAT'S CALLED BRIBERY, WE SHOULDN'T GET USED TO IT, SHOULD NEVER HAVE MADE IT LEGAL, WE SHOULD MAKE IT ILLEGAL AGAIN IN OUR DEMOCRACY. WOLF-PAC.COM. THE NEXT TIME RYAN ZINKE GOES TO YELLOWSTONE OR ANYONE ELSE, I WOULD LOVE HIM TO RUN INTO THE WOLF PAC. JUST THE POLITICAL KIND. WOLF-PAC.COM, GET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS.
