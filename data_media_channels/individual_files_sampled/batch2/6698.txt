Ford in much difficulty herself until the very end I think the point that she made at the end that they're there for other people three men Kavanagh judge PJ and a good friend of yours now Leland Kaiser so those are the four people you remember being there they don't they don't confirm corroborate what you had to say the Democrats once this is a talking point they could have handled this in July and August by turning it over to the FBI and having everybody interviewed confidentially and sharing that among the staff and make a decision but now that it's become public and was deliberately made public probably by a staff member for Dianne Feinstein this thing has become a Democrat cause cell Brahe it helps them with the electorate it keeps the focus on something they want and if they succeed in delaying it of so much the better but even if they don't they occupy valuable space in the weeks leading up to the midterm election he's making commentary on two things there one is oh we're screwed because she was totally credible and the Republicans could not damage her it is Karl Rove after all I mean and then he makes commentary on how they're in trouble politically because now the their Democrats are gonna use this but Carla you just said that she was very credible then you bum moan the fact that they're going to to say that Cavanaugh should not be on the Supreme Court because he might have attempted rape but but Rove sees that as only through a political lens that's right I think that's the problem I think that right now both sides it appears see this through a political lens and I wish that it wasn't the case like I wish that we focused on what's being alleged the importance of ensuring that someone who could have done this doesn't end up being a Supreme Court justice right like I think about it in terms of how would I feel if you know Democrats are in charge we have a Democratic lawmaker let's say Bernie Sanders in an ideal world is the President of the United States and he nominates someone who has similar allegations against him like take politics out of it I want an FBI investigation immediately I don't care if Bernie Sanders is the president I don't care if the Supreme Court justice is a progressive what I care about is justice you can't have a potential criminal being a Supreme Court justice there's a hundred million other progressives in the country we can just pick another one great so if the person actually did it and that's the huge if here but last thing you're Karl Rove remember worked with Kavanagh they worked together in the Bush administration he was in a lot of ways a mentor to Cavanaugh a Cavanaugh is a deeply political figure from day one so that's why it's unsurprising that karl rove in that case would be mad at the republicans for not being able to question Blasi Ford's credibility even though he acknowledges there that she is credible it's a classic car Rove complaint why didn't we rip her apart even though we know she's telling the truth look that's my interpretation you saw the video yourself you could interpret it any way you like but the bottom line is it's obvious even Karl Rove thought that she appeared very credible and and that's why he's mad at the Republicans thanks for watching this free clip of The Young Turks don't forget to become a TYT member today for more exclusive content join now at TYT calm slash join
