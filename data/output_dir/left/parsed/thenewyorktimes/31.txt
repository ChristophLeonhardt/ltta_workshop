“Over the past eight weeks,
I’ve witnessed firsthand
the Senate’s deep appreciation
for the vital role
of the American judiciary.”
“This confirmation process has
become a national disgrace.”
“The first thing
that makes a good judge
is independence,
not being swayed
by political or
public pressure —
that takes some backbone.”
“This whole two-week
effort has been
a calculated and
orchestrated political hit
fueled with apparent pent-up
anger about President Trump
and the 2016 election,
revenge on behalf
of the Clintons,
and millions of dollars
in money from outside
left-wing opposition groups.”
“The Supreme Court
must never, never be viewed
as a partisan institution.
The justices on
the Supreme Court
do not sit on opposite
sides of an aisle.”
“There has been a frenzy
on the left to come up
with something, anything.”
“The behavior of several
of the Democratic members
of this committee
at my hearing
a few weeks ago was
an embarrassment.”
“This is a circus.”
“The Supreme Court
is the last line of defense
for the separation of powers.”
“My judicial philosophy
is straightforward:
A judge must be independent.”
“I do not decide cases
based on personal or
policy preferences.”
“Are you saying that
Doctor Ford’s efforts
to come forward, to prepare for
the very difficult testimony
she gave today,
have all been part
of an orchestrated
political hit,
and are you
basically calling her
some kind of
political operative?”
“I’ve said, my family has
no ill will toward Dr. Ford.”
“But you’re not
saying in any way
that she is a political pawn,
political operative?”
“I said all allegations
should be taken seriously.”
“And you made the allegation
that she was coordinating it.
I do not think she
was coordinating —”
“I did not say that.
That‘s a —”
“You said — I’m sorry —
so you said that others
were making a coordinated —”
“Coordinated by people
in this room.”
“Not her. So she was not —”
“People in this room
coordinated it.”
