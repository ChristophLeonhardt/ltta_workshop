Tucker: BY NOW YOU HAVE HEARD THE CRUSHING NEWS ABOUT OUR COLLEAGUE AND DEAR FRIEND CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER. I HAVE ONLY A FEW WEEKS LEFT TO LIVE, CHARLES WROTE IN ONE OF HIS FINAL LETTERS. THIS IS THE FINAL VERDICT. MY FIGHT IS OVER." OVER THE COMING DAYS CHARLES WILL BE CELEBRATE AND ULTIMATELY EULOGIZED BY THOSE WHO KNEW HIM. FOR GENERATIONS HE WILL CONTINUE TO TOUCH AND GUIDE THOSE WHO DIDN'T KNOW HIM. HIS WORDS CLEAR AND CRISP AND TRUE WILL LONG OUTLIVE HIM. A LOT WILL BE SAID ABOUT CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD ONE THING. OVER THE MORE THAN 20 YEARS I KNEW HIM, CHARLES THOUGHT ABOUT DEATH EVERY DAY. HE TOLD ME THAT ONCE. IF THAT SOUNDS MORE MOROSE, IT'S THE OPPOSITE. HE WAS ONE OF THE RARE PEOPLE WITH THE COURAGE TO LOOK REALITY SQUARELY IN THE FACE. CHARLES RADIATED A CALM CHEERFULNESS. HE KNEW WHAT WAS COMING. HE HAD BEEN CLOSE TO IT BEFORE. HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE, BUT IT DIDN'T SCARE HIM. CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER IS A GENUINELY BRAVE MAN. FOR THAT REASON, HE IS A HAPPY MAN. "I LIVE THE LIFE THAT I INTENDED," HE WROTE. "THERE IS NO HIGHER ACHIEVEMENT THAN THAT." GOOD NIGHT. HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND.
