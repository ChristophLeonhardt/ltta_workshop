1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,529
>>DARRELL ISSA, IN A TOUGH
FIGHT, MAYBE THE FIGHT OF HIS

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:06,620
POLITICAL LIFE, WHAT'S HE GOING
TO DO?

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,620
LET'S FIND OUT --

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:20,470
>>[LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE GOT
HIM.]

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,640
>>DOWN GOES ISSA.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,740
MANN, DOUG
APPLEGATE KNOCKED HIM THE FUCK

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,250
OUT.

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,700
APPLEGATE WAS HIS OPPONENT
LAST TIME, IT WAS THE CLOSEST

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,900
RACE IN THE COUNTRY, APPLEGATE
SAID I'M COMING FOR YOU, ISSA

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,920
WAS LIKE, I'M RUNNING, I'M NOT
INTERESTED IN THAT FIGHT.

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,920
IT'S

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,370
GOING TO BE A REAL BAD YEAR FOR
REPUBLICANS.

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,440
DONALD TRUMP IS IN

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,380
FANTASYLAND SO HE DOESN'T
REALIZE THAT A 32% APPROVAL

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,649
RATING FOR HIMSELF IS
DISASTROUS.

16
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:55,649
IT WILL HURT THE

17
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,140
REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS
TREMENDOUSLY.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,140
REGULAR RULES OF

19
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,030
ORDER STILL APPLY, REALITY STILL
APPLIES.

20
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,030
JUST BECAUSE YOU WERE

21
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,560
UP AGAINST THE MOST UNPOPULAR
CANDIDATE EVER DOESN'T MEAN ALL

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,890
THESE GUYS WILL BE UP AGAINST
UNPOPULAR CANDIDATES.

23
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,890
ISSA IS UP

24
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,170
AGAINST APPLEGATE WHO WAS A
JUSTICE DEMOCRAT, THAT MEANS HE

25
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,670
DOESN'T TAKE ANY CORPORATE PAC
MONEY, HONEST, GRASSROOTS,

26
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,329
UNCORRUPTED, PROGRESSIVE, HIS
DISTRICT IS BECOMING MORE

27
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,990
PROGRESSIVE -- ? NA NA NA NA.

28
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,329
HE
WAS A GONER ANYWAY, HE WAS

29
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:29,369
RUNNING FROM THIS FIGHT, HE WAS
SCARED THAT APPLEGATE WAS GOING

30
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,560
TO KILL HIM, AND HE WAS, HE WAS
GOING TO EMBARRASS HIM.

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,090
LOOK AT THE OVERALL CONTEXT, WE
GO TO MOTHER JONES --

32
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:55,389
>>[LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE GOT
HIM]

33
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:58,869
>>SURE, DOWN GOES ROYCE, BUT
HE'S NOT THAT RELEVANT A FIGURE.

34
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:03,479
ISSA WAS THE HATCHET MAN FOR
REPUBLICANS, HE DID ALL THE

35
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,060
NONSENSE INVESTIGATIONS OF
DEMOCRATS THAT WERE TOTALLY

36
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,479
POLITICALLY DRIVEN, AND HE WAS
ONE OF THE WORST REPUBLICANS.

37
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,479
SO

38
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,989
THE FACT THAT A JUSTICE DEMOCRAT
HAS CHASED HIM OUT OF THAT SEAT

39
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:15,760
IS AWESOME.

40
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,200
BY THE WAY, IF YOU
DON'T KNOW, DOUG APPLEGATE IS

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,269
THE GUY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
HERE, LET'S SHOW YOU A PICTURE

42
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:23,680
BECAUSE YOU WILL GET TO KNOW
HIM, HOPEFULLY HE WILL BE YOUR

43
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,980
NEXT U.S. CONGRESSMAN FROM THIS
DISTRICT, AND HERE ARE HIS LINKS

44
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,300
BY THE WAY, THIS IS NOT THE TIME
TO LET UP, IT'S THE TIME TO HIT

45
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,800
THE GAS PEDAL EVEN HARDER.

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,290
AT
THIS POINT NOW CORPORATE

47
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,489
DEMOCRATS WILL PROBABLY GET REAL
THIRSTY AND TRY TO COME IN AND

48
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,600
MAKE SURE THAT SOMEONE WHO
SUPPORTED BERNIE SANDERS DOESN'T

49
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
WIN THAT RACE.

50
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,490
THEY DIDN'T GIVE
HIM MUCH SUPPORT LAST TIME

51
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,790
AROUND AT THE MOST BEAT ISSA
ANYWAY.

52
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,799
APPLEGATE PUT OUT A

53
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:48,799
QUOTE SAYING --

54
00:02:48,799 --> 00:03:18,130
>>COLONEL, WE NEED YOU TO TAKE
THAT HILL.

55
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,130
AND I BELIEVE HE

56
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,130
WILL.

57
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:33,409
AND APPARENTLY DARRELL
ISSA BELIEVES HE WILL, SO 

58
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:36,709
HE IS

59
00:03:36,709 --> 00:00:00,000
GOING, GOING, GONE.
