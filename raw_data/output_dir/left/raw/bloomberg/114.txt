00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,270
Amazon's planned acquisition of Whole Foods
highlights the explosive growth in organic

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,410
food sales.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,710
The U.S. Department of Agriculture says that
foods labeled organic must be grown without

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:18,349
synthetic fertilizers, and be free from Genetically
Modified Organisms. Meats must be from animals

5
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:26,119
raised without anti-biotics or growth hormones
and with access to the outdoors.

6
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:32,950
Its fans say organic foods have greater nutritional
benefits and can even help fight cancer. That's

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:38,109
why they , sometimes spend nearly twice as
much on for an organic food product compared

8
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:40,180
to a non-organic one.

9
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,200
But are organics really healthier? And are
they really worth the money?

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,460
Here's the Situation…

11
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,600
Concerns about the growing use of pesticides and use of antibiotics in animal feed

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,530
prompted some consumers to look for so called
organic food.

13
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,960
In 1990 Congress passed the Organic Foods
Production Act to develop national standards,

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,880
and organic products became more common.

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,060
Mainstream grocery chains started their own lines of
organic food, and larger food companies began

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,060
acquiring smaller health food companies to
get in on the action.

17
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:23,119
Now, from the big boxes to the small specialty
stores, three-quarters of U.S. grocers sell

18
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,119
organics foods.

19
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,590
Here's the Argument…

20
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,950
Proponents say that organic produce has more nutrients,
including antioxidants and vitamins, than

21
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:38,049
conventionally grown fruits and vegetables.
They also suggest eating organic limits exposure

22
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:41,979
to toxic chemicals that may lead to certain
cancers.

23
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:47,189
But while eating organic does reduce your
exposure to pesticides, there's not evidence

24
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:54,500
that the trace amounts in food are a danger.
Scientific surveys haven't found that organic

25
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,770
foods are much more nutritious. And, just
because food is organic, it doesn’t mean

26
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:06,180
that it's good for you. It may be nearly as
high in sugar, sodium or other unhealthy ingredients

27
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,119
as non-organic products.

28
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:15,069
Yet more farms are going organic to feed the
appetite for pure foods. With Big supermarket

29
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:21,510
chains like Kroger selling more organic products,
and Amazon's determination to drive down prices

30
00:02:21,510 --> 00:00:00,000
at Whole Foods, organic foods should only
increase in popularity. Healthy or not.
