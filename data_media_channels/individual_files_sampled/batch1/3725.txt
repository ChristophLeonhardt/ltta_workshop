welcome back to you ask and we answer let's start right in Francis snoot has asked us why don't you put posts on this site through a spell check before you post them that is a great question and that is the question that we ask our editors every day and I unfortunately think that the truth is that our editors are lazy la zy but fortunately we have given up trying to encourage spell checking and we've actually put a copy editing system in place which should be in place by the end of this week so hopefully things will improve but if they don't please keep complaining because that's our only weapon in this war against laziness on the part of our editors why is Tim Armstrong the CEO of AOL also going to be the chairman of the board in addition to the CEO in my opinion and this is Gordon speaking chairman should always be an outside director to minimize shenanigans usually I would agree with that in this case AOL has a lot bigger problems to worry about than whether tim armstrong is also the chairman of the company that really just retool the business but in any event yes probably would have been a good idea i think the other issue is that AOL has elected a very safe board pretty boring actually but probably decent governance in place so i wouldn't worry about that what i would worry about is how AOL gets out and rebuilds its business with regard to former goldman sachs alumni literally taking over the government and our financial system what can be done to extricate them that is a tough question from alert I don't know the answer I think the answer is we've got to hire some people from Morgan Stanley and I say that seriously we've got to hire from elsewhere in the economy but I don't see how you're ever going to fully eliminate this Washington Goldman corridor that is developed I think what actually is a lot more important is to put in provisions where taxpayers simply do not have to come to the rescue of Goldman Morgan and all the other firms and the simple solution there in my opinion is to not just not have firms that are too big to fail but to construct ways to allow them to fail without destroying the system and this I think is actually relatively easy to do by a system whereby their debt converts to equity if they get to a point where their capital is low enough we can set that up now you can not have such an issue that we had which is obviously Hughes moral hazard but I don't know how we're going to get away from Goldman Sachs actually being great training for the government if people can buy affordable health insurance that is not tied to the workplace well that spur innovation and entrepreneurs in America I don't know if it's Spurs innovation and entrepreneurs but I think it's a great idea you go back in history why is it that employers are supposed to pay for health care and any company that doesn't offer health care is a greedy company that isn't looking out for its employees that's because after World War two when we got into wage controls companies want to figure out some way of paying people more without actually raising their salary and that went to benefits they started offering health care and there we went that is sort of a silly system I think and ultimately it would be nice to dlink employers and healthcare put it onto the government put it somewhere but change the current system and yes hopefully that would free up capacity for people to be more entrepreneurial and so forth because one problem with being an entrepreneur or a sole practitioner or a freelancer or anything like that is that you don't have any health care is the recent influx of slide show posts more of a coincidence or part of a plan it is part of a plan and here at the business decider we do not call them slide shows we call them features so please ask us about features but in all seriousness I actually think that if you look at different media each one has a way of telling stories that is endemic to that media the media sort of is really particularly good for that in this case when we want to write a long post with a lot of different segments we have two choices you can either scroll a long way which some people like and we will definitely try to offer that option as much as possible or you can simply click a button and go through as if you were going through a presentation I think there's a lot to be said to the ladder and definitely it creates a lot more page views for us and lots of time that creates the opportunity for advertising so it's certainly good for us but i'd say that i actually prefer the slideshow motif a lot to having to scroll endlessly i think it breaks it up and it makes you an able to make a point and have an image with a reveal and everything else some of our editors just so if you keep complaining about that you'll definitely get some hoes an as in the newsroom but we will keep revisiting it will try not to completely data lose you what are your thoughts on senator Dodds proposal to create freeze credit card interest rates I think it's terrible not because companies aren't being absolutely outrageous in jacking up rates and we've had some stories on the site recently of Citigroup raising rates to thirty percent and so forth which is just outrageous but the idea of again the government coming in and artificially saying you got to freeze rates that certainly goes too far for my point of view in terms of what the government should be doing why have you guys de-emphasize the green sheet which is our segment that is focused on infrastructure and green technology and things like that we have emphasized it because the great editor of the green sheet jro is now moved over to media and we need an excellent new editor on the green sheet so if this is something you want to write about let us know are there any plans to have a free iPhone app for the site by this we have an iphone app that does sort of convert the site if you see it so you feel free to check that out I actually have turn it off because it doesn't get me to the comments which is a source of frustration that will be dealing with but it works for a lot of people and they like it we will at some point have a downloadable app I'm not sure how long that will take but hopefully in the next few months lastly is John Carney the editor of cluster stock actually the son of Ayn Rand the free market thinker he is actually break it to you and sort of by proof the free market thinking of John Carney if you've read his stuff this probably sort of reflects some of what you've seen on the site and some of his more free for all posts but yes he definitely does have a free market bent to him we have a lot more questions on the site that we didn't get to and we will try to answer some of those and in future segments will be breaking these up into two segments 14 s AI and one for the financial world but in the meantime thank you again we'll be back next week
