why do they have to incorporate a symbol
that has oppressed so many and led to so
many people's death that they have to
promote it and say hey this is the
biggest part of my history and you got
to deal with it
how are you so mad because it's my it's
my heritage you know I mean I've got
I've got relatives that fought in the
Civil War they were dirt poor farmers
okay they did not they can only any
sleep
look impaired father two weeks ago I got
on the bike for the first time I wrote
for a wheel I can comment on their in
the airport you see United States flag
and she's a Mississippi flag people have
a visceral reaction to that flag it is
not a hospitable symbol
