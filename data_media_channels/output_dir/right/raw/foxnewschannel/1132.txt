1
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:10,292
STEVE: WELL, OUR CONGRESS IS

2
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:10,993
STILL WAITING FOR ANSWERS ON

3
00:00:10,993 --> 00:00:11,994
THE FBI'S RUSSIA

4
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:12,427
INVESTIGATION.

00:00:12,427 --> 00:00:14,229
IN A NEW OP-ED CALLS ON THE

6
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:15,964
AGENCY'S DIRECTOR TO EXPLAIN

7
00:00:15,964 --> 00:00:16,765
HOW THE INVESTIGATION

8
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:19,034
STARTED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

9
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:20,902
COMPARING THE PROBE TO

10
00:00:20,902 --> 00:00:21,370
WATERGATE.

11
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,904
OUR NEXT GUEST ASKS WHAT DID

12
00:00:22,904 --> 00:00:25,641
THE FBI KNOW AND WHEN DID IT

13
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:25,974
KNOW IT?

14
00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:27,009
BILL MCGURN WROTE THAT IN

15
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:27,709
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL."

16
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:29,444
IS HE ALSO A FOX NEWS

17
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:29,845
CONTRIBUTOR.

18
00:00:29,845 --> 00:00:30,379
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

19
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:34,282
>> HI.

20
00:00:34,282 --> 00:00:35,550
STEVE: THESE ARE TROUBLING

21
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,318
DAYS AT THE FBI, AREN'T

22
00:00:36,318 --> 00:00:36,618
THEY.

23
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:37,986
>> THESE ARE VERY TROUBLING

24
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:38,487
DAYS.

25
00:00:38,487 --> 00:00:41,890
EVERY DAY WE LEARN SOMETHING

26
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:42,157
NEW.

27
00:00:42,157 --> 00:00:42,891
TWO SCANDALS.

28
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:43,992
HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL.

29
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:44,693
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

30
00:00:44,693 --> 00:00:46,461
AND IT'S THE SAME CAST OF

31
00:00:46,461 --> 00:00:47,295
CHARACTERS IN BOTH

32
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:49,398
INVESTIGATIONS.

33
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:50,165
STEVE: ONE OF THE THINGS YOU

34
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:52,601
SAY IN YOUR OP-ED IS WE HAVE

35
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:53,402
GOT DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER

36
00:00:53,402 --> 00:00:53,702
WRAY.

37
00:00:53,702 --> 00:00:54,803
HE HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR.

38
00:00:54,803 --> 00:00:56,304
I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I

39
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:59,541
CAN TO HELP CONGRESS.

40
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,709
>> IN HIS STATEMENT HE HAS

41
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:02,210
BEEN VERY CLEAR.

42
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,178
STEVE: HE IS PLAYING A

43
00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:03,879
DOUBLE GAME.

44
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:05,681
>> HE MADE END RUN EARLY ON

45
00:01:05,681 --> 00:01:06,515
THIS YEAR WHEN HE WENT TO

46
00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:07,783
THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE TO TRY

47
00:01:07,783 --> 00:01:09,584
TO PREVENT, YOU KNOW,

48
00:01:09,584 --> 00:01:10,719
COUGHING UP INFORMATION.

49
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,887
CHAIRMAN NUNES HAD

50
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:12,287
SUBPOENAED.

51
00:01:12,287 --> 00:01:14,056
AND I THINK ALSO AT A

52
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:15,223
HEARING IN DECEMBER, HE KIND

53
00:01:15,223 --> 00:01:17,159
OF SUGGESTED THAT HE

54
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:17,859
COULDN'T SHARE THIS

55
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:18,627
INFORMATION WITH CONGRESS

56
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:19,461
BECAUSE IT'S CLASSIFIED.

57
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:21,997
IT JUST GETS THE ARRANGEMENT

58
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:22,364
BACKWARDS.

59
00:01:22,364 --> 00:01:23,999
YOU KNOW, THE FBI AND EVERY

60
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:25,968
FEDERAL AGENCY IS

61
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:27,803
ACCOUNTABLE ULTIMATELY TO WE

62
00:01:27,803 --> 00:01:29,204
THE PEOPLE ACTING THROUGH

63
00:01:29,204 --> 00:01:31,373
OUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES.

64
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:32,040
STEVE: ONE OF THE OTHER

65
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,308
THINGS YOU ADDRESS, IS WE

66
00:01:33,308 --> 00:01:34,776
DON'T KNOW WHY THINGS GOT

67
00:01:34,776 --> 00:01:35,110
STARTED.

68
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,878
>> RIGHT.

69
00:01:36,878 --> 00:01:37,512
STEVE: ULTIMATELY THAT'S

70
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:38,280
WHAT CONGRESS IS TRYING TO

71
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,814
GET.

72
00:01:38,814 --> 00:01:39,848
THEY WANT TO SEAT SCOPE

73
00:01:39,848 --> 00:01:40,148
MEMO.

74
00:01:40,148 --> 00:01:44,386
THEY WANT TO SEE FISA STUFF.

75
00:01:44,386 --> 00:01:49,458
FBI AND DOJ SAY SORRY THAT'S

76
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,160
OFF LIMITS THAT'S A BIG

77
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,460
DEAL.

78
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,930
CHRISTOPHER STEELE.

79
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,665
HALPER, THE DIFFERENT FBI

80
00:01:56,665 --> 00:01:57,800
AGENTS, ANDY MCCABE.

81
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,834
WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT

82
00:01:58,834 --> 00:01:59,168
STARTED.

83
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:01,303
THE FBI AND DOJ HAS BEEN

84
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:02,805
VERY RESISTANT IN PROVIDING

85
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:04,339
THE DOCUMENTS THAT WOULD LET

86
00:02:04,339 --> 00:02:07,443
US KNOW HOW AND WHY THIS

87
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:07,876
STARTED.

88
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:08,877
STEVE: WHY IS THAT?

89
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:11,447
>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO WONDER.

90
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:13,416
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IS THAT

91
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,051
THE OFFICIAL START OF THE

92
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,953
INVESTIGATION, JULY 311st,

93
00:02:16,953 --> 00:02:18,421
WAS NOT REALLY THE START.

94
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:21,524
THEY WERE LOOKING INTO SOME.

95
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:22,358
STEVE: THE PRESIDENT TWEETED

96
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:28,831
SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT OUT

97
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:29,198
YESTERDAY.

98
00:02:29,198 --> 00:02:30,500
CARTER PAGE WAS CONDUCTED

99
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,602
ABOUT STEVEN HALPER.

100
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:33,503
HE WAS CONTACTED ABOUT THIS

101
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:35,338
IN MAY IT WASN'T HALPER THAT

102
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:35,805
CONTACTED HIM.

103
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:37,607
IT WAS A GROUP THAT HE WAS

104
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:40,776
HELPING AND PUTTING ON THE

105
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:41,244
CONFERENCE.

106
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:41,811
STEVE: WE ARE PUTTING

107
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:42,311
TOGETHER A PUZZLE.

108
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:42,845
>> RIGHT.

109
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:44,447
>> THERE ARE A MR. PIECES ON

110
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:46,048
THIS TABLE.

111
00:02:46,048 --> 00:02:47,216
WE LITTLE PIECE HERE, AND

112
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:48,251
HERE AND HERE.

113
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,819
STARTING TO ALL COME

114
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:50,286
TOGETHER.

115
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:51,587
ULTIMATELY IT KIND OF MAKES

116
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:52,755
THE FBI LOOK REALLY

117
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:53,122
POLITICAL.

118
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:53,789
AT LEAST SOMEBODY THERE.

119
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:55,258
>> IF YOU REMEMBER, DEVIN

120
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,126
NUNES HAS NOT SAID WHAT HE

121
00:02:57,126 --> 00:02:58,995
SAW WHEN HE READ THE

122
00:02:58,995 --> 00:02:59,595
ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION

123
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:01,497
THAT LAUNCHED THE --

124
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:03,166
OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED THE

125
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:03,833
INVESTIGATION.

126
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,801
BUT HE DID SAY IT DIDN'T

127
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:06,869
HAVE INTELLIGENCE IN IT.

128
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:08,538
IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE BASED

129
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:09,672
ON AN INTELLIGENCE PRODUCT.

130
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:11,674
THAT'S A TROUBLING QUESTION.

131
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:14,944
ALSO, IT SHOULD BE A BIG

132
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:15,611
DEAL TO INVESTIGATE A

133
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:17,146
CAMPAIGN OR GET A FISA

134
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:18,181
WARRANT ON AN AMERICAN

135
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:18,514
CITIZEN.

136
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:20,216
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THIS WAS

137
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:23,819
DONE MORE CASUALLY THAN

138
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:24,387
SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

139
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:24,987
STEVE: THERE ARE PEOPLE

140
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:25,621
ARRANGED THE PRESIDENT OF

141
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:26,289
THE UNITED STATES WHO SAY

142
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,926
THIS WAS SIMPLY, AT ITS

143
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:31,561
ORIGIN A BRAZEN PLOT TO DOOM

144
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:31,994
DONALD TRUMP.

145
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:32,695
>> RIGHT.

146
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:34,030
WELL, WE DON'T KNOW THAT

147
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,298
IT'S TROUBLING TO HEAR AN

148
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,632
FBI AGENT TALK ABOUT AN

149
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:37,767
INSURANCE POLICY.

150
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:38,134
RIGHT?

151
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,702
STEVE: YOU KNOW.

152
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:40,870
YOUR DAD WAS AN FBI AGENT

153
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,404
FOR YEARS.

154
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:42,471
>> I HAVE A LOFT AFFECTION

155
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,339
FOR THE FBI.

156
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:45,007
I KNOW GREAT MEN AND WOMEN

157
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,175
THAT WERE AGENTS AND ARE

158
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:47,643
AGENTS AND SO FORTH.

159
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:49,145
BUT, AT THE TOP, THIS

160
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:53,416
LEADERSHIP, I THINK, IS JUST

161
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:58,187
BEEN SCANDALOUS.

162
00:03:58,187 --> 00:03:59,088
STEVE: CHRIS WRAY COULD FIX

163
00:03:59,088 --> 00:03:59,488
THIS TODAY.

164
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:00,823
>> HE COULD.

165
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,925
HE GAVE IN HIS PRESS

166
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:04,093
RELEASE, SAID I'M DOUBLING

167
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:05,228
THE NUMBER OF STAFF.

168
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:06,295
THAT'S AN INPUT.

169
00:04:06,295 --> 00:00:00,000
THE QUESTION IS THE OUTPUT.
