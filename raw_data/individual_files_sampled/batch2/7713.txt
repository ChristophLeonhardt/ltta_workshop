joining me now is Alexander bove he is one of the students that is organizing to fight back against all the school shootings that that are happening he's from Bethesda Maryland Alexander great to have you here on rebel headquarters thank you for hanging on no problem so let's talk about what you did after the Parkland shooting to organize a your school and beyond um so immediately after the Parkland shootings I organized a I joined a group that was just being organized called Montgomery County students for gun control our first actions were to immediately start forming plans for a walkout um cuz there was a walkout that was going to happen across the nation but we wanted to develop it into something more so we brought around three and a half thousand students to DC to show our legislators that were gonna you know come to their door staff and we're gonna show them you know what we think Alex how old are you I am sixteen sixteen not sixty okay and what we're great are you in I'm a sophomore don't wait okay bless your heart man you've got some people that are attacking some of the students the new president of the NRF Oliver North now famously or infamously referred to people protesting in favor of gun control as civil terrorists in fact you refer to the students as civil terrorists how do you respond to it well how can I be the terrorist kid he's part of the group that's helping to contribute to the shooting up of schools that's terrorism not what I'm doing are you disheartened to see adults not acting responsibly on an issue like this well I am to start heartened but that is what I have grown to expect from the adults on this issue they have clearly not stepped up and so now it's the students turn what was the the role your role in the role of the group that you're in in organizing the rally March 14th for the rally on March 14th our main goal was to have a lot of publicity make this the conversation for that week and sort of drum off more of a conversation about it in that week some 10 days before March 4 our lives which obviously is much bigger and would draw more attention but we wanted to sort of start ramping that up in addition um March for our wives was a student events um and so was our event but we included legislators we had Nancy Pelosi speak John Lewis speak Chuck Schumer speak we wanted to sort of have something that we could share with the legislators that agree with us um legislators that we need in order to make the change that we seek and that was the goal of March 14th when did George Soros approach you was it when you were in junior high school because I'm led to believe that Soros has organized all these protests and not students like you well um I guess around a year ago he approached me he gave me a $20,000 check and said man I'll send you to college if you can just overthrow the government I mean people grown-ass people actually believe in insanity like that so I mean you're 16 he would have had to approach you but you're almost in elementary school like man if he's that smart and he knows how good you're gonna be at the age of 16 maybe he's on to something okay anyway so back to planet Earth after the Texas shooting at Santa Fe High School there was also an action on Capitol Hill what was that um so it was a very spontaneous action my group thought we needed to have an immediate response we can't just let the you know NRA try to sort of slide by unnoticed with this we had to let the legislators know that they're still on notice um we haven't had a major public act since April 20th and we need to stay in the picture and so we organized lions where some of our members got arrested in front of all rands office okay so the people who are selling the guns that are killing the kids are not arrested but the kids who are protesting the massacres are arrested I just want to review for the people at home that is exactly correct okay I understand okay uh now you also have events that are coming up what do you want people to do how can they fight back so the rallies are good but what action do you want them to take well the most profound action Macon pay is primaries are going on right now you have to vote for gun sense candidates use usual with endorsements from organizations like moms demand action or the Brady Campaign that's who you vote for if you want to keep people safe that's who you vote for and then come the general election um assuming those candidates win you have to continue to support them and you know it doesn't matter whether they're a Democrat or a Republican as long as they're interested in keep getting guns off the street in keeping students safe without the whole side of turning schools into prisons that is your goal so lieutenant governor camp Patrick today in Texas said he had a right idea in fact he said this right after the shootings he added absurdities today to it today but he said it's not the guns are not the problem the doors of the problem that there's just too many doors in the schools well you go to a school right now have you noticed the epidemic of too many doors in your school um certainly not the doors are necessary for the order of the day to go about my school has two and a half thousand students there's no way you know we could get people you know on and off the buses in a timely manner in the morning if we did not have you know Doris and this is what I was saying earlier about turning schools into prisons we can't do that because then we're letting these terrorists win yeah and he mentioned other political issues and and of course the video games there back in in Japan where they have the same exact video games no one gets shot because they don't guns so do any of your friends play video games and have you has that led to any massacres as far as you know no video games just don't lead to massacres um I don't engage in that sort of video games plenty of my friends do they're all perfectly sane people perfectly normal people none of them would ever commit a mass shooting but they also do don't have guns um and that is as you said that's the defining factor in whether you're capable of a mass shooting Alexander had they ever thrown their video games at anyone or herdin no no okay got you alright because yeah alright video games are not designed to kill people what guns are right I almost forgot there for a second I mean look I I say all this stuff sarcastically because the the points that they make are preposterous they keep circling a circling around the real issue the real issue it's thing is that it's the guns it's the guns that like so Alexander when you're a sophomore and you're a sophomore now and in high school right yeah I don't know if you guys do active shooter drills in your school but are you afraid of trenchcoats as Hugh Hewitt said today and other right-wing pundit are you afraid of video games are you afraid of any that god has been taken out of school are you afraid of bullets I'm afraid of the bullets um you know I'm not afraid of the trench gun I'm afraid of the gun under the trench kept it trench coat is immaterial to me I don't care what you wear I don't care what video games you play just as long as you're not coming into my school with your gun to kill me that is all I care about all right Alexandre Bove doing great work already at the age of 16 really appreciate you coming on the show and they handle their on Twitter is moko students for gun control I assume that that is Montgomery County and not some sort of coffee drink right it is like oh my godness okay alright but since you guys are new DC organizing a lot of events in DC and super helpful to the people who want sanity back in this country so thank you Alex we appreciate it i D
