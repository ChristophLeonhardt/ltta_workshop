this is what helps me survive it keeps me alive for Aundre Hampton health insurance is a life saver what would happen if you didn't have this coverage quite honestly did I couldn't afford medication type 1 diabetes cost Hampton the site in his left eye in 2004 the medications he uses to avoid further problems cost more than $700 a month all covered by insurance Americans like Andre Hampton have to make some difficult choices he's unemployed and gets his healthcare through the Medicaid program for the poor but it only covers individuals who make less than $17,000 that makes it hard to pay those premiums so he might be in a position where he has to choose between a job and having health insurance yeah with the US healthcare system in crisis being sick in America is getting more expensive we actually pay more per person than every other developed country and we actually have lower bang for our buck the research firm a Villere says the price of the most popular plans and the insurance exchanges created by the 2010 act known as Obamacare will rise on average 15% that's due largely to the Trump administration's cuts in federal subsidies and the planned repeal next year of the so-called individual mandate requiring every u.s. resident to have health insurance for public hospitals like Strowger Cook County that mandate has been a money saver and it's stabilized us in a substantial way of financially in the 1990s one in four patients at Strowger had insurance now most do 58 percent taxpayers spend less than a quarter of what they did in 2009 if the teeth are taken out of the end of the individual mandate or if the health care premiums on the marketplace go up because of a lack of will and the part of the government to underwrite and subsidize those plans then we will be back to the Stone Age again with more people who are uninsured showing up at our at our facilities Andre Hampton fears that could cost lives like his no matter what race creed or color everyone gets sick you know don't take away the care and the plan that we have now for now his remains a success story in one of the few developed countries where life expectancy is going down john Hendron al-jazeera Chicago
