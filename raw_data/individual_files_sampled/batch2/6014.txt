the remains of a suspected poacher were found in a wildlife reserve in South Africa the poacher or alleged poacher was attacked by a pride of lions lion pride pride of lions I don't know what's the why they got my lions okay in fact ladies and gentlemen we got him okay so let me give you the details according to reports it seems the victim was poaching in the game park when he was attacked and killed by lions they ate his body nearly all of it and just left his head and some remains that is a police spokesperson who released a statement about this now the reason why they suspect he was a poacher is because he had a loaded weapon and it's unclear whether he was looking to poach lions or if he was there to poach rhinos because rhinos are usually poached in the area that he's in and the reason why poachers go after the Rhino is because they want the horn rhino horn is used in so-called traditional medicine it doesn't actually work to cure anything at all but some people in some countries think that it does last year several lines though were found poisoned near a farm in the same province with their heads and paws sawn off and and by the way lion body parts are sometimes used in traditional medicine as well on the one hand it's gruesome all there is left is a rifle and a guy's head on the other hand cutting off Lions heads and paws is also gruesome and doing that the Rhinos and sometimes they cut the horn while they're still alive sometimes they kill them and then cut the horns off and so poachers are the second most guilty here the most guilty of the people who buy this crap that's right and so look I'm torn on whether to have any sympathy at all for that guy so let's let's talk a little bit about our thought process in regards to this story because you know during our production meeting this story comes up I pitch it and at first neither one of us had much sympathy for the for the victim here for the person who lost his life and then the point a very good point was brought up regarding how he could have been living in poverty desperately needed the money and then there's the market for this type of stuff for the rhino horn for the lion paws because they think that it will cure their ailments or whatever it is and so then I started feeling a little bit of sympathy for the guy because if you're poor and you know that there's like this black market that you can make decent money off of I mean what are you gonna do are you gonna feed your kids or you know have your principles so I don't know I don't know much about the guy we don't know much about the victim in fact they can't even really identify him at the moment because of the fact that he only has a head left and it's hard to identify who he is now with that said though you're absolutely right the people that you should have no sympathy for are those who keep buying these animal parts we're not talking about big-game hunters who do this legally we're talking about poachers illegally murdering these animals and then selling these body parts to people who think that it's going to cure them from illnesses and you know it's slightly worse than that because sometimes it's secure illnesses and sometimes it's because they think it's gonna make their penis larger it's true it is true and so look I don't know that that makes it a worse but it feels worse like like but that's really stupid and it's one thing if you're desperate for cure to cancer because your aunt has cancer so another thing if you're desperate for an extra inch and you're willing to slaughter these animals to to get it when there's absolutely no evidence that would even help you even if it were to help you is that's the wrong thing to do etc and of course it doesn't help you of course it doesn't and so look the other thing about poachers and and hunters to some degrees let you sign up for something you signed up to to kill lions in that particular case they get the fight back you just watch the video by The Young Turks the home of the Revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member tea white tea network.com slash join
