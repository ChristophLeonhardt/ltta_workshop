while Steve King was speaking to Alison cammarata on CNN the issue of the border wall and how we're gonna pay for it came up and he believes that we should take money away from food stamps and also from Planned Parenthood to help fund the stupid border wall right okay well he also decided to pick on Michelle Obama and her initiative when the Obama administration was in office she just wanted to ensure that school lunches were healthier right let's have better standards for school lunches so we can tackle the obesity epidemic well here's his reaction in response to all of that in the context of the border wall conversation we built the program because to solve the problem of malnutrition in America and now we have a problem of obesity and when you match up the EBT card with the with the scale say on some other folks I think it's worth looking at Michelle Obama looked at it Republicans should be able to look at it too okay um he's just so incredibly ignorant right like he knows nothing about why the obesity epidemic is a problem it's not because people are getting fat off food stamps the more poor you are the less likely you have access or the ability to afford healthier foods right that obviously keep you healthier help you keep a healthier body weight I mean it's just look the reason why a lot of people living in poverty are more likely to be overweight or obese is because they end up spending what little money they have on cheap quick foods right you fast food cheap junk food when when you could barely survive and you need food stamps to be able to eat you're not worried about organic produce yeah your pet beef you're not going to Whole Foods okay that's not what's happening the average income of a household on food stamps is less than 10,000 a year these guys are always talking about like all they got they got cell phones which you made that up you have no idea what kind of phones they have or don't have Oh what was that they have refrigerators like that apparently that's like a crime to ever frigerator right so no the reality is poor being less than $10,000 a year and and and ironically yes when you eat those cheap processed foods you you do gain weight now you want to know the real reason why because of high fructose corn syrup that we've put in all that food and why don't we put high fructose corn syrup because it's so cheap why is that because corn has a gigantic subsidy now who pushes for that corn subsidy legislators from Iowa like Steve King that's crony capitalism that's what makes us obese is a country far more obese than any other country because we have so much more high fructose corn syrup in our food and ironically that's because of Steve King help us build independent media together TYT Network aam /join
