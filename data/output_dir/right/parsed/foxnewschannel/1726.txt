>> Neil: IT IS LOOKING
BETTER FOR GINA HASPEL TO BE
THE FIRST WOMAN TO HOLD THE
CIA DIRECTOR AS SOME KEY
SENATE REPUBLICANS AND A
NUMBER OF TOP DEMOCRATS HAVE
SAID THEY WOULD BE YEA VOTES
FOR THE PRESIDENT'S CHOICE
TO HEAD THAT, INCLUDING MARK
WARNER WHO HAS SAID THAT HE
WOULD SUPPORT HER IN THAT
EFFORT.
SO FAR, NOT SUCH A
COMMITMENT FROM REPUBLICAN
KENTUCKY SENATOR RAND PAUL.
HE JOINS US RIGHT NOW.
SENATOR, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> THANKS, NEIL.
>> Neil: I DID CATCH YOUR
LETTER TO MS. HASPEL TO FIND
OUT HOW SHE STANDS ON A
COUPLE OF KEY ISSUES.
MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK
THIS HAS TO DO WITH TAR
TEMPERATURE.
YOUR LETTER ADDRESSES FAR
BIGGER ISSUES.
COULD YOU EXPLAIN?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M
CONCERNED THERE ARE REPORTS
THAT JOHN BRENNAN WAS
COOPERATING WITH BRITISH
INTELLIGENCE TO SPY ON THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.
SOME ARE SAYING OH IT WAS
INCIDENTALLY COLLECTED.
IT'S STILL A BIG DEAL.
THERE IS A QUESTION, THERE
ARE SOME ACCUSATIONS
ACTUALLY ORDERED BY
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
ADMINISTRATION EITHER
THROUGH JOHN BRENNAN OR
OTHERS.
GINA HASPEL IS THE ACTING
DIRECTOR OF THE CIA.
SHE IS HIGH ENOUGH UP IN THE
CIA.
I THINK WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT
SHE KNOWS ABOUT WHETHER THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS
SURVEILLED UPON.
WE DO KNOW THAT JOHN
BRENNAN, SINCE HE HAS LEFT
GOVERNMENT, HAS BECOME AN
OUTSPOKEN PARTISAN AGAINST
THE PRESIDENT IN VERY
DEFAMATORY TERMS.
SO, YES, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT
GINA HASPEL BEING A CLOSE
ACHE LIGHT OF JOHN BRENNAN.
I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
FROM HER IF SHE IS APPOINTED
IF SHE IS INDEED APPOINTED,
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT
DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT THE
SURVEILLANCE OF THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN AND WHY WAS THE CIA
INVOLVED.
>> Neil: DO YOU THINK THAT
SHE SHARES FORMER DIRECTOR
BRENNAN'S CONTEMPT?
>> I THINK THAT SHE IS A
CLOSE ACHE LIGHT OF JOHN
BRENNAN.
I THINK SOME HAVE CALLED HER
A PROTEGE.
I WORRY NOW WE HAVE SEEN
JOHN BRENNAN'S STRIPES.
IS HE A PARTISAN.
HATER OF DONALD TRUMP.
SO I DON'T WANT PEOPLE
RUNNING OUR INTELLIGENCE
AGENCIES THAT HAVE AN AX TO
GRIND OR HAVE SOME SORT OF
PARTISANSHIP LURKING BENEATH
THE SERVICE.
NUMBER OF REASONS WHY I
OPPOSE HER.
NUMBER ONE IS TORTURE.
THE CIA WAS.
SENDING PEOPLE TO BE
TORTURED IN ASSAD, SYRIA.
NOW, WE SAY ASSAD IS A
TERRIBLE GUY BECAUSE HE
GASSED HIS PEOPLE IN ALL
LIKELIHOOD.
WELL, SOMEBODY IN THE CIA
THOUGHT HE WAS A GREAT GUY
BECAUSE HE WAS SO BEARING
AND TORTURE PEOPLE.
THE PROBLEM IS 20% OF THE
PEOPLE THAT WERE TORTURED
WRONG IDENTITY GOT THE WRONG
PEOPLE.
THAT IS A MISTAKE AND DARK
PERIOD FOUR HISTORY AND WE
SHOULDN'T REWARD SOMEONE
LIKE GINA HASPEL.
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE
REVELATIONS OUT OF THE NORTH
KOREANS WANT OUT.
TIME BEING WITH THE SOUTH
KOREANS?
SOME SAY THAT IS A PREVIEW
TO MAYBE WALKING OUT
UPCOMING TALKS WITH THE
PRESIDENT.
>> I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT
IS IMPORTANT WE ARE TALKING
BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAT THE
SOUTH KOREANS ARE TALKING.
DIRECT TALKS BETWEEN NORTH
AND SOUTH KOREA ARE
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.
THE ONLY WAY PEACE COMES TO
THE PENINSULA IS WHERE THEY
ARE ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN
TALKS.
I HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED OVER
THE PAST MONTH THAT THERE
HAS BEEN MORE TALK THAN
THERE HAS BEEN FOR A LONG
TIME.
>> Neil: FOR F. FOR SOME
REASON THE NORTH KOREANS ARE
SUDDENLINELY MAKING BIG ADO
ABOUT JOINT MILITARY
EXERCISES WITH THE SOUTH
KOREANS.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?
DO YOU BELIEVE WE SHOULD DO
SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THAT OR
WHAT?
>> WELL, I THINK THEY HAVE A
GOOD FAITH STOPPED THEIR
TESTING SO FAR AS WE CAN
TELL.
MAYBE BECAUSE THEY HAVE
COMPLETED ALL THEIR TESTING.
THEY HAVE AT LEAST AGREED TO
STOP THEIR NUCLEAR TESTING.
I THINK NOT DOING MILITARY
EXERCISES WOULD ACTUALLY BE
A SHOW OF GOOD FAITH ON OUR
PART.
IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING
PERMANENTLY.
BUT DELAYING THAT UNTIL
AFTER TALKS I THINK WOULD BE
A GOOD IDEA.
>> Neil: MUCH HAS BEEN MADE
OF THESE COMMENTS THAT A
WHITE HOUSE AIDE MADE
CONCERNING JOHN MCCAIN.
THEY WERE CRUDE, RUDE, IN
POLITIC, MANY ADMINISTRATION
PEOPLE HAVE COME ON MY AIR
AND SAYING THE SAME THING.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT
AND WHETHER THE
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE
ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THAT?
SHOULD SHE GO?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> JOHN MCCAIN AND I HAVE
HAD MANY SPIRITED
DISAGREEMENTS BUT WE
ACTUALLY DO AGREE ON TORTURE
AND GINA HASPEL THAT SHE
SHOULDN'T BE NOMINATED TO BE
THE HEAD.
SO I TRY TO FIND AREAS OF
AGREEMENT WHEN I CAN WITH
JOHN MCCAIN AND I THINK IT'S
SOMETHING THAT IS OBVIOUSLY
INAPPROPRIATE AND SHOULD NOT
HAVE BEEN SAID.
>> Neil: WOULD YOU FIRE THE
PERSON WHO SAID IT?
>> IF THEY WORKED FOR ME.
>> Neil: DOES IT TROUBLE YOU
SHE IS ON THE JOB?
>> I CAN'T CONTROL
EVERYTHING.
I CAN'T CONTROL WHITE HOUSE
DECISIONS AT THE WHITE
HOUSE.
I DO THINK IT WAS
INAPPROPRIATELY SAID.
I DO THINK WHERE WE CAN FIND
AGREEMENT WE SHOULD.
WHEN WE HAVE DISAGREEMENTS
WE SHOULD TRY NOT TO MAKE
THEM PERSONAL IF POSSIBLE.
>> Neil: PRESIDENT MUCH MORE
CONCERNED WITH THE LEAK
ITSELF.
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT.
>> WELL, IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT YOU BE ABLE TO DISCUSS
THINGS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS
AND THAT YOU HAVE NOT HAVE
EVERYTHING SAID IN PUBLIC.
AND SO I THINK THEY DO HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THE WHITE
HOUSE WITH LEAKS.
BUT I THINK BOTH THE
INSULTING NATURE OF WHAT WAS
SAID AND THE LEAK.
>> Neil: PUSHING DONALD
TRUMP'S BUDGET PLAN, IS IT
YOUR CONCERN HERE NO MATTER
WHAT YOU DO, THEY WILL JUST
KEEP SPENDING WILLY-NILLY?
>> REPUBLICANS SAY THEY ARE
CONSERVATIVE THEY SAY AND
VOTE FOR BALANCED AMENDMENTS
AND DO THE OPPOSITE VOTE TO
BUST THE BUDGET CAPS AND
GIVE US MORE DEBT.
I'M PUTTING FORWARD A
BALANCED BUDGET IN FIVE
YEARS.
CALLED THE PENNY PLAN.
CUT ONE PENNY OF EVERY
DOLLAR.
THIS SEX SEEDINGLY POPULAR
WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.
IT'S WHAT WE SAY WE ARE FOR.
GIVE SENATORS ON THURSDAY A
CHANCE TO VOTE ON THIS.
IT WILL BE A PRIVILEGE VOTE.
I WILL GET A VOTE AND
CONSERVATIVES WILL BE PUT ON
RECORD WHETHER THEY ARE
REALLY CONSERVATIVE OR NOT.
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.
IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.
I WANT TO HAVE YOU BACK AND
