00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so a couple of weeks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was invited to a press screening of</font>

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,460
the phone men women and children and the

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">PR people working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> film said we'd</font>

5
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:08,760
love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sponsor a video where you give a</font>

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,440
fair and honest review about the film

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,330
and you also talk a little bit about

8
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,070
your relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> with social media and</font>

9
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">any insights you basically have to share</font>

10
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,240
about that I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to rehash a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plot</font>

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,740
summary because that really wasn't my

12
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,660
way into the film my way into the film

13
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,340
was that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a story about a community</font>

14
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">and because these are parents and</font>

15
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,430
children the high school community the

16
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,869
local school community where those

17
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,340
stories intersect but they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

18
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">discrete experiences it was kind of like</font>

19
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,140
if you think that too maybe 2008 John

20
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,700
Green terms of talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about his books</font>

21
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,350
it's like a lot of parallel or train

22
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,790
tracks but if you looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shape of</font>

23
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,140
them they would intersect but they would

24
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,790
come apart again and intersect again

25
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,710
many many<font color="#CCCCCC"> times and each of those train</font>

26
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,480
tracks is a different parent or child or

27
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,710
student or teacher within the high

28
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,000
school community now<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,140
protagonists<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this thumb have a</font>

30
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,460
certain relationship to the internet

31

whether it is that they love it or hate

32
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,820
it will fear it what they find within it

33
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,260
whether they use it just for facebook

34
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,730

39
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,220
very different reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> for using the</font>

40
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,080
internet the story was trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> very hard</font>

41
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,450
to present a very unbiased view of

42
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,070
online experience and how different

43
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">people use the internet but more often</font>

44
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,280

traditional view of the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

47
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,140
kind of dangerous something bit sinister

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> more likely to be used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

wrong would put someone in danger than

50
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,270
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be celebrated something</font>

51
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,770
where amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> communities happen</font>

52
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,939
something that we ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

53
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,799
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and understand in a sort of</font>

54
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,299
more organic way rather than being

55
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,700
afraid of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and entering the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

56
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,880
in terms of a sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess more</font>

57
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">capitalist culture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or consumer culture</font>

58
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,960
of what can it give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> in exchange for</font>

59
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,280
this thing in exchange for this

60
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,810
interaction in exchange for this

61
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,040
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> which I don't think is</font>

62
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,850
necessarily how humans always behave I

63
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,259
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's always the case and I</font>

64
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,390
also don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's how at its most</font>

65
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,790
enriching the internet works three big

66
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,409
aspects of the film that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

67
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,759
about the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

68
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,380
going to spoil any plot points for there

69
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,909
is something that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the mothers</font>

70
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,390
does that made<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of my friends and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

71
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">all went to see the breastfeeding at the</font>

72
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,479
same time we all just issued this

73
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,120
collective gasp about something huge

74
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,099
invasion of privacy this huge invasion

75
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,840
of personal experience that his mother

76
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,510
did with one small<font color="#E5E5E5"> action on the</font>

77
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,670
computer the second point is that Ansel

78
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,860
Elgort character is really really really

79
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,140
in to things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> World of Warcraft and</font>

80
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">his dad is completely mystified by them</font>

81
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:29,190
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one scene when his dad goes</font>

82
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,989
into his room and the game is off<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

83
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:32,549
computer and he starts to press the

84
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:34,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">little arrow keys and like moves the guy</font>

85
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">around left right and center and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

86
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">could have been such a beautiful moment</font>

87
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,690
of understanding or at least of some

88
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,670
level of appreciating the fun that could

89
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,930
be found<font color="#E5E5E5"> within the game and the</font>

90
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,340
communities that can be created<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

91
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,450
these games and kind of just

92
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,670
experiencing a sense of wonder at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

93
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,099
yeah appreciating it for what it is but

94
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,709
instead the film<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes in a different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

95
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:53,879
and the father has a very different

96
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,200
attitude and I don't know whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

97
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,120
part of my personal frustration with

98
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,430
certain generations just deciding to

99
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,260
actively shut out the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and deny</font>

100
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,390
that it's any good and<font color="#E5E5E5"> denied that there</font>

101
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,250
can be valuable things found<font color="#E5E5E5"> within</font>

102
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,980
online communities and within video

103
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,170
games as well or whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

104
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually just as a sort of walking path</font>

105
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,459
there that was not taken the road not

106
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:15,720
taken and one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

107
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,130
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really did love about the story</font>

108
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,200
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it opens with narration by Emma</font>

109
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,030
Thompson and that carries on for a

110
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,620
certain portion of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> films as you</font>

111
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,389
basically just looks in at this

112
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:26,220
community from outside and<font color="#CCCCCC"> is making</font>

113
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,200
commentary<font color="#E5E5E5"> you never see her face is</font>

114
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">just her voice it's just her voice</font>

115
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,989
narrating it I really spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one of</font>

116
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:32,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ways that a lot of us use the</font>

117
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,900
internet to kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on</font>

118
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,430
absolutely everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write our own</font>

119
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,370
narratives and to take agency in that

120
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,410
sense even in a sarcastic sometimes

121
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,000
slightly derisive sort of way just

122
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,340
comment on the humans and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weird</font>

123
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,900
things that you're experiencing your

124
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">day-to-day like the existence of her</font>

125
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,440
commentary really highlighted that for

126
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,940
me it reminded me of<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that my</font>

127
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,530
sister said quite recently because one

128
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,449
of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> sisters is really into terror and</font>

129
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:55,530
she said that one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

130
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">my one of my most problematic elements</font>

131
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,519
is the parade<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is something that</font>

132
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,709
came up and she was doing my cards and

133
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,620
my needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of live a certain life</font>

134
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,449
on parade and on show but I think that

135
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:08,760
that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something difficult but it</font>

136
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,129
is also something that I do enjoy at

137
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:12,900
least within certain measurements I like

138
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,730
sharing my<font color="#E5E5E5"> life but it's not just a one</font>

139
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,260
waiting i also like reading<font color="#CCCCCC"> about other</font>

140
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,358
people's lives and using the internet

141
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,450
and using social media to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

142
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,430
experience but then also read other

143
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,530
people's experience and experience of a

144
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,910
people's<font color="#CCCCCC"> lives through their own words</font>

145
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,260
and through their pictures and through

146
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,790
there emerges and all of that sort of

147
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,840
stuff like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

148
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,550
necessarily a shallow way into

149
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,070
communicating with each other and

150
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,060
forging connections with communities

151
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,440
because if I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'd be such a</font>

152
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,900
hypocrite when so much of my life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

153
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,639
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the best things in my life have</font>

154
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,260
come from these amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> online</font>

155
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,400
communities and there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">serious and sad and triggering</font>

157
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,240
storylines in this film and there are

158
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,940
some parts of the internet that I wish I

159
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,820
didn't identify with but I did that I

160
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,160
portrayed in this film and that I did

161
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,870
relate to<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that I did wish like oh I</font>

162
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,190
wish that hadn't been part of my

163
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,080
relationship with the internet but I

164
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,610
don't believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the good cancels out</font>

165
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,290
the bad and the less that the bad

166
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,970
effects the good they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just exist again</font>

167
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,100
on two separate planes they sometimes

168
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,200
intersect but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't cancel each</font>

169
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,690
other out and they don't make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

any less valid I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting for the</font>

171
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,310
generation of filmmakers who aren't

172
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,900
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a point about whether the</font>

173
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,460
internet and whether social media as a

174
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,220
whole is a good inherently or bad

175
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,020
inherently thing because I think that

176
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,520
misses the larger point about the

177
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,320
internet which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about community and</font>

178
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">how strong those bonds are that you form</font>

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,229
