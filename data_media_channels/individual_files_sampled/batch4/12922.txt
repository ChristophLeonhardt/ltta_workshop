after months of high-stakes negotiations the Trump Kim summit is finally back on that's right Kim Kardashian is coming to the White House she's gonna be talking about criminal justice reform I know that's the Kim summit you've all been waiting for we will analyze the political and philosophical ramifications of the Kim summit there's actually a lot to see here and a lot of new directions for the administration then Allie Stuckey will stop by to give me advice on love and sex and marriage and children at least at three three of those four we will get to her and we'll talk about other things as well and then we will have the mailbag because I'm going away on my honeymoon for a week and I wanted people to talk to you you people you people who might love so much I want to be able to talk to you before I go away I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Knowles show before we get to the Kim Summit before we get to the Kim Kardashian summit I guess we still have to talk about Roseanne right we still have to talk about it Roseanne has been trending on Twitter for the last 48 hours just consecutively and listen I get it you know she's actually been pretty gracious about all this she says don't try to defend my tweet it's indefensible it's a bad joke I'm sorry I said I didn't mean oh whatever right the thing I really don't want us to lose sight of while everybody is criticizing Roseanne is that Valerie Jarrett is a terrible person I don't want us to fall into this trap conservatives fall into this trap where we really don't want Democrats to call us racists so then we tried it when now we're like defending Valerie Jarrett Valerie Jarrett is awful just a quick little run down she was the top personal aide to Barack Obama for his entire presidency and really before the presidency she goes back in Chicago a long ways with Barack and Michelle the Obama White House these are people who work for Barack Obama referred to her as the nightstalker she who must not be challenged she would follow the Obamas into the private residence at night and keep talking to them Rahm Emmanuel Barack Obama's chief of staff regularly referred to Valerie Jarrett alternately as day and cou say Hussein they did not have AI opinion of her she had a staff of three dozen and she did everything from decide who goes to state dinners to what gifts should be given to foreign heads of state she might have been behind the idea of Obama giving Queen Elizabeth a pod an iPod full of his own speeches who knows but she also was in charge of the advising on who should be nominated to the Supreme Court advising on who should be appointed as certain ambassadors really a wide breadth of power she was considered effectively the chief of staff that's why she butted heads with all of Obama's chiefs of staff it was her idea to appoint Van Jones 9/11 truth or Van Jones to Tua's our position at the White House she pushed Solyndra at the White House she got Barack Obama to give a speech at cilinder Solyndra ed core she helped crush American business when she was the White House liaison to the business community who obviously the Obama White House was terrible on business she was the main liaison there Larry Summers by the way agreed with that another Obama official agreed with that when Valerie Jarrett comes from Chicago she is a crony corrupt Chicago politician on the order of Barack Obama but only more so so when she was in Chicago she was the CEO of this crony Democrat Chicago real estate firm called the habitat company when she was CEO of the habitat company Valerie Jarrett built some of the worst public housing slums in the entire country many of those required federal intervention to fix she was practically a slumlord in 2011 a Valerie Jarrett disrespected a four-star general because she was in an event with him and she ordered a drink from him she wanted him to she thought that he was a waiter or something like that I'm gonna keep going on because there's a lot more to say about Valerie Jarrett but before we do that I have to thank candid company candid Co candid go is really really good you might notice as as I'm describing you know all of these awful political things I'm smiling and you see my pearly whites you see either nice and in line there they're white and everything I have to thank candid CO candid is helping people gain confidence through accessible and affordable orthodontic care candid makes the process of straightening your teeth convenient and easy by having the customer take the process into their own hands even though the customer is taking the process into their own hands there are these highly trained orthodontists at candids Network and that they review each and every case and direct the entire aligner plan when I was a kid when we were all were kids orthodontics were very very expensive you had to go to doctor visits all the time candid is an amazing solution to your orthodontic troubles you get straighter and brighter teeth in an average of six months and candid costs sixty-five percent less than braces no office visits needed I know look I'm a millennial I don't want to leave my chair ever I don't want to do anything that takes more than five minutes ever candid makes that possible you don't have to go to the orthodontist office the clear aligners are sent directly to your home they are customized specifically for you to straighten your teeth they they fix crooked teeth crowding protrusions and gaps it's really important think think of how you waste money in your life on things that

orthodontist frequently until candid now candid really fills that need it's really really good you get a real worth of dontist that's the main reason that that you can pick candid you know other

defending Valerie Jarrett like a bunch of dum-dums so she was practically a slumlord when she was the head of that company habitat company in Chicago uh if she demanded a full security detail when she was in the White House even though it wasn't quite clear what her job was other than just being a powerful person behind the scenes lasted the entire presidency she demanded a full security detail a lot of Obama aides said it was for simple prestige she was a flatterer she's a crony she's got long-standing ties to the Muslim Brotherhood spoken as a keynote at Muslim Brotherhood affiliated organization national events so many of her family were anti American radical Communists associated with communists that she her family members were under FBI surveillance for that reason stop defending Valerie Jarrett stop it a lot of conservatives are saying right now that we we have to disavow Roseann we have to call her Hitler we have to say Rosanna's a neo-nazi and she's terrible and I hate her and her no-good stinkin dog too otherwise Democrats will call us racist that's what they say and this is the worst logic of conservatives it is such weak sauce don't do it who cares if a Democrat calls you a racist you know what you know why I don't care when Democrats call me a racist because I'm not a racist because I don't despise people because of their race I don't want to discriminate against people because of their race so I don't care when Democrats say that a key to a happy life is not caring what your political opponents say who cares what Democrats say about you they have no moral authority they have no credibility I do not care they can slap me on the back and call me Charlie for all I care it doesn't matter I am NOT a racist I don't care what Democrats say who they are morally bankrupt Democrats I would much rather be called a racist than a Democrat by the way because a Democrat is an actual racist right who I mean that is one of the worst epithets you can call somebody is Democrat they're morally bankrupt what their their their words on this matter have no effect stop sucking up to them stop trying to get your approval they're going to call you all manner of evil things regardless of what you do be good do the right thing don't you know discriminate against people because of their race don't hate people because of their race and don't care what Democrats say it's very very foolish okay let's get into the big news of the day Kim is coming to the White House we thought those we thought these peace talks had all broken down but no can't the supreme leader kim kardashian is coming to the White House that cultural dictator Kim Kardashian is gonna make it to the White House I am obviously you might have thought I was talking about the

Kim Kardashian talk means plus we'll have some mailbag and talking to Allie Stuckey because this Kim Kardashian talk actually really does matter and and we should pay attention because it's not just a little sideshow it is it is an important piece of policy that's going on right now before all of that I got to tell you about dynatrap I love dynatrap dynatrap has revolutionized my home summertime is

elegant and nice get it okay so we're running low on time here but I'm gonna fly through these Kim Kardashian what's she going to the White House to talk about she's going there to meet with Jared Kushner that prison reform criminal justice reform this is something this is one of these issues that lefties are pushing and conservatives who want to seem like cool guys and get approval from the left they are pretending is important now to criminal justice reform what it really means is letting criminals out of prison when you hear criminal justice reform usually what you're hearing is let's let bad guys out of prison so anyway Kim Kardashian wants to go and talk to Kushner about this but a part of the reason that Kushner really cares about this issue is that Jarrod Kushner's father went to prison for tax evasion illegal campaign contributions witness tampering when Kushner was a younger younger boy and so now he wants to get Republicans to back letting criminals out of prison so Kushner is pushing this bill called the first-step Act the first-step Act this is what Kushner said it illustrates a total misunderstanding of this issue but we can explain why that is he says if we start showing that we can make the prisons more purposeful and more effective at lowering the recidivism rate over time that may help the people who are trying to make the argument for sentencing reform so Trump said he would sign this bill it just passed the House overwhelmingly three 6259 this is where Jared Kushner's Democrat Court is showing and I hope Republicans don't fall for this so it's the first step act right and it what they do in DC is they make these acts they ads like these very long acronyms so it's the formerly incarcerated reenter society transformed safely transitioning every person Act what it does is it gives out goodtime credits to prison inmates and it can cut a week per year off of their sentence but it works retroactively Lee so there are going to be people who when this passes they'll just get out of jail immediately it's gonna be a get-out-of-jail-free card they also are now proposing a quarter billion dollars in extra spending for educational and rehabilitative programs for these inmates and the Kushner explained the core of this issue the core of this total misunderstanding by he said quote the single biggest thing we want to do is really define what the purpose of a prison is is the purpose to punish is the purpose to warehouser is the purpose to rehabilitate yeah while all of those things that's the purpose I know what he wants us to say is that it's just to rehabilitate that's what he wants he says it was just a rehabilitate this gets to a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of prison and of justice there are three kinds of punishment retributive punishment deterrence and rehabilitation those are those are the three purposes of punishment and of our prison system to exact retribution for crimes that were committed to deter and to rehabilitate but now we only ever talked about the latter two and really just the last one we really only talked about prison as therapy is that we're sending them to some nice to turks and caicos so they can work out their problems we're talking about criminals no you're punishing them mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent as Adam Smith said criminal justice I talked to a lot of people in this field in the criminal justice field criminologists I kid you not I said I asked them what's the purpose of criminal justice and almost uniformly they they say it's sometimes deterrent and to rehabilitate they don't talk about the retributive aspect but I say okay well that's criminal justice huh that's your explanation so where does the justice come in does justice have anything to do with criminal justice they say oh I kid you not I've talked to people who have PhDs in this they say I've never thought about that before I've never thought that criminal justice maybe should have anything to do with justice and we're totally missing this we're missing this now because our a ability to discuss questions about virtue and morality and the moral order in the metaphysical world is so so weakened it's it's become so as so degraded and it's a decayed so much that we don't even know that that's a possibility there's another large push now on so-called criminal justice reform to treat 21 year old criminals as though they are children they want that them to be tried in juvenile courts 21 year old commits some heinous crime oh he's just a kid he's just a kid isn't he is I mean now we have 30 year olds living with their parents and refusing to be evicted so I suppose maybe that's they maybe there should be 30 year olds next they all say oh my brain made me do it this is why we don't punish people anymore is because we're trying to defer moral responsibility we say I'm not responsible for my actions it was society it was my circumstances it was poverty it was a lack of education or finally which is what we've gotten to you my brain made me do it I just couldn't control myself just my brain the random physical material synapses in my brain just made me commit the crime so you can't punish me because that's true if materialism is true then you certainly shouldn't punish anybody for a crime they have no moral culpability they could walk up and slit your throat it's not how dare you punish them they didn't do it their brain made them do it so this is the the morally idiotic and practically idiotic aspect of so-called criminal justice reform it morally it doesn't make any sense it's totally incoherent you know now we're referring we don't call people juvenile delinquents anymore the new term is justice involved youth that's the Obama era term which is ironic because they're explicitly injustice engulfed youth but you listen if we quibbled about every word we'd be here for the next for my entire honeymoon it doesn't make sense it's morally idiotic it's also practically idiotic people say we have too many people in prison in America do we I don't know is our crime rate zero then I know that then I think we have too few people in prison in America don't we there was that famous headline in the New York Times Fox Butterfield wrote it it was something to the effect of the crime continued crime rate continues to fall despite prisons filling he's a disco dine so you're locking up all of the criminals and the criminal crime rate is falling yeah that's probably despite that's probably the word I would use to describe it dummies of the New York Times so anyway Tom cotton opposes this Tom cotton has basically exactly the view that I have we don't have an overpopulation problem in prison we have an under population problem in prison we need to lock up more criminals and we need to stop pretending that people don't have any moral culpability whatsoever it is it is a recipe for social disaster let's get to the mailbag in the remaining few minutes I don't know I'm gonna have to ask the control room how many more minutes I have to get through these mailbag questions I'll try to fly through them the first question is from Evan a dear soon to be shackled Michael Knowles will the daily wire be live streaming the blessed day Evan you know that we were going to livestream at the blessed night but I got such a negative reaction to my Valentine's Day promotion video with the short little smoking jacket and my dainty little legs that I I didn't want to subject myself to that sort of insulting criticism again so no we won't be live-streaming the day or the night so there so there Evan from Spencer oh Maximus Rex Kofi phenols oom what do you think makes done to his Divine Comedy stand out among the other classics of the Western canon as a work of singular genius what would you say are its most fundamental themes and what are the most important lessons we take away from reading Dante since you've quoted Dante in both Italian and English I figured you must have carefully studied the comedy at some point I look forward to hearing your insights on the poem so my basic insights are that it is so shockingly beautiful and it is so unified that this is what strikes me most you don't really catch this in the English but he employs a scheme called terza rima these these rhymes of three that just very quickly the beginning of the poem it sounds just listen to the sounds if you don't speak Italian just hear Nelnet so they'll come in D nostra Vita Miri travaille para una salvos Cora que la Drita Viera Morita I quanto a dear koala echo Sidora as the Selva salvages a Forte can l pensiero novella power there's this usually you can hear those rhymes in those sets of three so it's very beautiful and that goes on for a hundred Conti and also it's all unified so instead of giving you my thoughts on this I asked a close friend of mine Catherine Illingworth who is a Dante's scholar and coincidentally was a TA of mine in college and I asked her for her thoughts because she's a real expert on this and she said exactly what I think in much better words with there are three aspects here a universality what makes it stand out the universality of it you go from the depths of evil to the heights of holiness and it touches on all things seen and unseen of the human condition it masters all previous art and literature Dante is led by Virgil Dante has drunk up and read and consumed all of the art and culture and literature of his time and then he creates something original out of it because he's totally absorbed it and turns it into something new and because it's so beautiful are the most fundamental themes or that human love is rooted in God all of it all of human love the erotic love fraternal love love of your friends love of the the Divine Love all that love from whatever you were doing on Saturday night to whatever you were doing Sunday afternoon is all of that is rooted in God you see Beatrice a girl that wasn't Dante's wife leads him to salvation because he's following her through to to salvation to God there's the unity of the private and the public so the idea here is that the world will be orderly when people are virtuous it won't just become peaceful and orderly if you have vicious people or bad people and there's a unity here of what you do in your private life and what you do in your public life sometimes in politics and other works we try to divorce those things you can't there is a unity there is a Catholicism right there's a universality here and there's the relationship between love and knowledge here so - for Dante one leads to the other and and together they both lead to salvation to it - a total transformation not following a set of rules to being utterly transformed by divine love and some lessons from Dante read a lot you have to read a lot of books just like Dante did so that you can absorb all of that and it can really save your civilization and save your soul another lesson is that grace is real this is an utterly graceful poem and you should accept grace because it's the only goodness it doesn't matter how lost you are when you begin that journey what age you begin that journey at it there's this utter grace you see people in in paradise who weren't always such great people Saint John Vianney said not all the Saints started well but they all ended well as you see that and and that love is always good it's a third lesson love is always good but you shouldn't just settle for a little piece of it just a little fragment of love you should follow it to its logical conclusion Beatrice Dante finds this girl when he's a little kid he falls in love with her marries another woman you know she died he's totally in love with with Beatrice and he follows Beatrice not to just devour Beatrice to make an idol of his love for Beatrice but to follow that love and allow that love to be ennobling and lift him toward the very heights of heaven - the love that moves the Sun and the other stars we could talk about Dante forever and ever especially when I'm hearing all these good thoughts from Kathryn Illingworth before we get to the next question I got to talk about another cool story so one is gonna be really fun this is a great narrative this is a good narrative story and ennobling story and this one's fun and you can listen to it in your car I'm really excited to tell you about a cool new show called this sounds serious a new cast Vox creation it tells a fictional murder story that

do that CBC is this is that and pan a please Dexter guff is smarter than you stars Peter oldring Dexter guff is smarter than you and Carly Pope from arrow suits and Elysium each episodes about 25 minutes long perfect for a commute or a road trip go to WWE okay I've got only four minutes before we can get to my conversation with Allie she gives me pretty mind-blowing advice on marriage whether or not I should run away right now I haven't gotten married yet I could still leave a Michael shaped hole in the wall somewhere but let's try to get one or two more questions in from William dear His Holiness of the Michael a trend among liberal hit job interviews is to barrage conservative interviewees with a host of questions that are designed to misrepresent the views of the person being interviewed and put the onus on them to debunk an argument that they never make he cites the example of Jordan Peterson who does Jordan Peterson answers that British interviewer perfectly reasonably and then she twists it and tries to make him look like a monster monster rather is it interviewing etiquette for the person who's being interviewed not to call the interviewer out for nefarious tactics or would it be smarter to hold interviewers to their own standards before allowing the conversation just to skip to the next point without forcing the interviewer to concede both the tactic and the point I really really like that love to show keep it co FF a William okay yes so what they do what the left does and the mainstream media do when they're interviewing you they basically ask conservatives do you still beat your wife that is the question they ask you do you still beat your wife then any answer you give it's not gonna look very good for you they always do this so the the way to do this now is to be a bulldog with these people I mean be an AB hold them out on everything be very clear I've had many reporters call from Fox and the New York Times or whatever and I'm not I'm cordial to them but I'm not nice and I don't you know I'm pretty open with my feelings about what they do what kind of broadly speaking what hit jobs they do another way for conservatives to do this is not to agree to pre taped interviews because they always mess those up they always mix them up and make us look like racist mean-spirited evil people so don't agree to that broadly if you're going to agree to one make sure there's a live component to it or make sure that you're filming them filming you that's a real key because otherwise they're gonna make you look awful from Tim dear Rachel Maddow's estranged brother does Ben pay you in shekels or cold Tim well Ben doesn't pay me at all of course I mean hasn't paid me in a long time he did give me a lump of coal for Christmas but I like to think of that more as a future diamond I think that that's really been wanted to get me like a nice big diamond ring or something and you know I will say he just sent me a wedding present and he got me a blender here this is a true story really did get me a blender and I don't know why I don't know why when Ben thinks of me in my future he just thinks of very sharp blades spinning around very fast turning formerly solid entities into mush I don't know but it's very nice you know I like I like the blender very much from Kyle dear patron saint of smug Catholics everywhere I've been hearing a lot recently about how the American Constitution has a somewhat Protestant foundation to it but I'm not exactly sure what this means could you discuss it further Thanks PS any tips on getting started with cigars would be appreciated yes you should light them that would be the the first step to getting started with cigars cutting them is good too but lighting is probably the most important one as to the question about the Protestant foundations of America in the Constitution there's a little truth to that good old Papa Knowles who came over on the Mayflower grandpappy Samuel fuller and the others were Protestant religious zealots I mean they would be shocked and horrified by the flagrant potpourri of their progeny so if there is an aspect of this and it manifests in a few ways that rugged individualism that distaste for many institutions I I will concede that has some Protestant foundations I will point out though that America the americas have a catholic foundation their don't have a protestant foundation was Christopher Columbus a devout wonderful serious devout charitable wonderful brilliant fabulous terrific Catholic man Christopher Columbus that's a Catholic foundation so the Americas broadly have that I think it's totally ridiculous to say that Catholics don't have the pioneer spirit or want to go and spread spread the word of God and glory and freedom to every end of the earth if that isn't true so yes you can concede that there's a largely Protestant foundation in the United States but you know this the Americas baby that was the first one that was the original 1492 not a Protestant thing about it okay it's too bad because we've got some great questions to delve into but sadly we just can't we just can't get to them today I'll try to answer them I will point out other just before we go one person who wrote in said hey Michael I just got my helix sleep mattress and Boeing brand sheets in the mail today it's quite possibly the greatest combination in the history of the world thank you for the mountains of coffe fa and left us tears that i take straight to the dome daily you're welcome i wanted to get that little sponsor plug in

boulders and you can try not to drown and left us tears go to daily wire.com we'll be right back with my interview with Ali Stuckey so you know alleys Stuckey alleys been with us since the beginning alley stopped by LA on her way I don't know she's such a jet setter she stopped by right before I flew out to so we talked about the really important things because after this folks the next time you see me I'm gonna be about fifty pounds heavier probably sweaty or unshaven you know pushing a lawnmower in the suburbs somewhere ten kids around me I'm getting married okay that's what I'm saying I got a little advice from a least uh key on it on that and many other topics here is my interview with Allie Stuckey Allie it's good to see you Michael it's great to see you so listen we're on a time constraint here yeah Allie has a flight in about 17 hours so you have to leave for LAX right now I'm LA scares me the traffic is horrific I I just I'm worried and I don't know LAX and so I just have to make sure that I get there on time you know I do this I this is a I know you're intend to do a Praeger video part of it talks about sexual differences between men and women yes this is a sexual difference between men and women the airport arrival time yeah I I go I was going back to New York for Christmas this was Christmas week I showed up 35 minutes before departure not before boarding or chat just before departure I made it it was fine plus you know you got that pre check the pre-check is the greatest invention but you just never know and I feel like people in California are just kind of crazy there's some predictable there it's very unpredictable it is also they're the worst drivers in the country yes that's the problem sweet little ELISA does this too though we'll be flying you know domestically and she'll say you know man we need to leave four and a half hours before we get there impression I'm sure that your fiancee doesn't say what you mean it's horrible like it is inaccurate er no I don't know how she sounds but I hope she doesn't sound like it 85 year old hag how dare you call my fiancee an 85 year old hag for me I'm just saying you might want to nail the impersonation before you leave for the honeymoon suite little ELISA got very upset because I did this podcast with Drew another Kingdom where I play all the characters in I know I listen to oh it's great so I told sweet little lace I said your voice and by your voice I mean the voice that I have created for you it plays a role in one of the characters she goes oh is it that pretty character Jane said no it's a rat woman it's a mutant rat Mac it's not it's not you're writing your own vows are you worried we're gonna get up there and then I'm just gonna do the bass for her I do she has a long a long life of suffering ahead of her but it'll be well she knows what she's getting herself into now on the topic of marriage yes a big marriage proponent you've been married you were selling fake marriage what if I said I wasn't that would be really troubling I would yeah well that I'm trying to get advice from all corners here before I make this major life decision well you've already made the decision my friend so you should stick to it no marriage is awesome it's the best thing that I've ever done best best second best decision I've ever made after following Christ and I love it I mean it really is I know it's so cliche everyone's like oh you get to marry your best friend but it's really true I mean what could be better than going home and being like I get to hang out with the person that I always want to be with all the time the only person that I really want to talk to the only person I really want to spend time with and watch Netflix with them really what is better than that I love all of that and I agree entirely with that sentiment but I do have to ask because I hear this and I only hear this from girls the marry your best friend thing is that come on yeah you don't think so I I mean he's he's my best friend now I love my other friends but he is my best friend he's the person that I want to spend time with all the time but when I don't you think there's a categorical difference like when I think of my best friend I think of you know going out and smoking cigars and you know carousing and I don't know doing whatever guys do you know I think I guess maybe it is a girl thing I think of my best friend is someone who I can be my most genuine self with all the time and there are just no barriers that's how I feel about the best friend but you know you have a different mentality about and it is true I mean practically speaking your your wife will be your best friend you that you hang out with that person all the time you know each other backwards four words you know yeah that's true I can't get it you know when I just think of that though it's now you'll figure it in masculine when I oh my gosh no you'll love it marriage is awesome now did you see there's a new comment out by a a I computer scientist the guy who invented that robot that looks a lot like a woman you know and it's like really uncanny and scary he says that we will be his name as a Victor David no David Victor I confuse him with Victor Davis Hanson anyway whatever his name is dr. so-and-so he says that we will be marrying robots by 2045 is I wonder one if that's gonna happen I mean we're already having sex with robots that already exists in 2018 I'm using wheat loosely by the way we're gonna edit that out and post that already exists do you do you see the culture moving in that direction I'm only half kidding do you think there will be a time when we're marrying artificial intelligence robots I think I think probably I think probably so I mean we've already devalued and cheapened marriage so much to the point to where it's just this kind of this transaction where you do it for a little bit if it works out where it's more like a contract that we sign it if you want to break it you can get out of it that kind of thing we've already devalued it and cheapen it so much that I have a hard time believing that humans have some kind of moral limit that we won't get to the point of objectifying or cheapening marriage that much to we're marrying artificial intelligence I would love to think that we do I would love to think that deep in the human heart something's just gonna wake up and say no that's not a real person but I will tell you that if the robots are anything like they are in West world it will be very very difficult to actually distinguish that's true because okay this is another gender difference have you watched Westworld I know my only experience of Westworld is the star of Westworld the blonde girl Dolores Evan Rachel Wood Evan Rachel Wood started a Twitter fight with me she was angry about something I said yeah and so I didn't know who she was I said oh pretty little actress okay I'll respond she's being very mean and I was being very respectful and then at the end she said something else mean and then she blocked me that's my old soured on Westworld right now those robots are me I know I blame it on the a oh yeah okay so here's a gender difference that's interesting with Westworld and I'll turn tie back into what we were actually talking about so season one you know that all the artificial intelligence that they're robots all the guys in my life all the people that I know that watch Westworld we all love season one together season two I still liked season two the girlfriends that I have liked season two no guy that I know that watched season one like season two and I think the reason is because they start to blur the lines between the robots and the humans to where you don't know anymore if who's a robot and who's not I don't mind that because to me I have a soft spot for the robots like they feel thanks too but all the guy is in my life they're like what the heck they're robots I don't really care if they get murdered I don't care if they get killed so I just think that's interesting and I wonder if that mentality will be true to win what if that'll be true when artificial intelligence starts infiltrating our lives if there will be a different perception between men and women of robots that yeah I wonder about that because women are just nicer and more pleasant and more nurturing generally and men yeah they're a little colder you know they're not as nurturing toward babies or animals and are very sentimental so you don't really sentimentalize a robot or something like that yeah I mean we've already got so much of them in our in our homes you know the government spying on us through Alexa and all of that I I'm so abusive to Alexa I am like if Alexa has rights in the in 2045 I'm getting booked and going to jail that's scary for what I know I want to talk about work okay I want to talk it you know there's marriage and there's work yeah that's how you says marriages work they say the there is a new study out that the number one cause of long-term poverty in America is not working I know this is shocking I know I didn't want to do that to you just before you're about to get on a flight what yeah that is the number one cause so the statistics that are being cited here 82% of people on food stamps are able-bodied adults 3800 I think it's 32 percent of them 32 or 38 or working at all not full-time just part-time a couple hours here and there at all the vast majority of them are not working one little bit how do we resolve this problem how do we how do we you know because we have this very sentimental view of it we say all these poor people we need to spend more money from the government more food stamps more whatever they're just not working but why would they work when they probably make more money off of the government they probably lose some money by getting a job when I spoke at UC Berkeley we had someone that drove for hours to come here our little panel and he was telling me his story afterwards how he used to be homeless and now he has a job and he has a lot of friends who are still homeless who don't understand why he transitioned from homelessness to having a job just because it's so much harder having a job and he's like it is I make less money than I did when I was homeless oh my isn't that crazy and so I I think it's abuse of the welfare system it really is it more lucrative to not have a job these days than to have one sometimes it depends on what kind of job you can get I guess I remember John Stossel did one of these you know sting things and he went out and dressed up like a bum and begged for money and then he annualized his income and tried to figure out how much he could make and it was something like 90 grand a year tax-free or something it's pretty good you know so insane so that's why I think like when ben Carson has said this and he's gotten you know he's gotten so much flack for it that a lot of times poverty is a mentality not in all cases certainly not in all cases but a lot of times it is and I honestly don't know how you shake someone out of that it's almost like Stockholm Syndrome long-term poverty it certainly is a mentality I mean people you know in economies people fall on hard times right for a period of time but long-term poverty certainly is a choice right you know do you saw this story about the Millennial the 30 year old kid the 30 there's a 30 year old kid he has a kid you know he's a dad oh and he's a daddy he's a 30 year old kid he has his own son is living in his parents house they beg him to leave or get a job or do anything five times they ask him send him notices they finally have to take him to court to do it is this a millennial that you know the Millennials are the I mean Millennials part of your Christian name I believe conservative millennial the it's a much-maligned group the Millennials get a lot of flack these days is it all deserved in this case absolutely but I don't know if it's the fact that she is a millennial and he's like really kind of on the edge of millenials anyway I think that you have deadbeats in every generation this guy is just a deadbeat guy I do think it's probably a trend in Millennials were certainly more entitled we don't know the value of the dollar as much as our parents did just because a lot of us didn't have to but I think it's something like a third of Millennials still live at home which again is not always a bad thing I have friends that who are now very successful who had to live at home right after college but it's this perpetual adolescence and this prolonged immaturity that we see among Millennials that scares me those are the people that are voting for Bernie Sanders that's true I will say it is a little rich of me I'm about to go on a three day long bachelor party to be talking about irresponsibility and carousing and things but yeah that that that does seem to be certainly the case I want to ask you before I let you go because you're an expert on Millennials you're an expert on marriage now having done it and you you're also an expert on Christianity now listen expert but you talk about it a lot you're a practicing Christian and you know I'm not going to pull out the squirt gun of Catholic holy water and spray you and try to bring you back home to Mother Church I've had enough potpourri on the show recently what I do want to know though evangelicals have been getting a lot of flack recently - mmm this week has been a rough week for evangelicals it's been a tough week for evangelicals and I want to know specifically evangelicals are being called hypocrites for supporting Trump there was that big piece in the Atlantic last month by Michael Gerson I think how they sold their soul to support Trump I don't understand these arguments at all what do you make of them because you know listen I'm a Catholic so we're we have a little more loosey-goosey view on some of these things you know yeah so that's a good way to describe what is your take on that on the hypocrisy the alleged hypocrisy of evangelicals who support Donald right it's only hypocritical if you're saying simultaneously oh actually having sex with a porn star while you're married is totally fine and over here saying adultery is wrong but I don't see and I'm not saying no easy angelical czar doing that but even Robert Jeffress who has been quite a mouthpiece for Donald Trump and I don't agree with everything he has said in favor of Donald Trump but even he has said you know we still stand where we stand morally we don't think it's okay to have sex with a porn chart we don't think it's okay to cheat on your wife but he is the most pro-life president that we've ever had moving the embassy to Jerusalem is a big deal to them even things like deregulation and promoting capitalism is a big deal to Protestants Protestantism and capitalism really have gone hand in hand since the Protestant Reformation so we have these values that we feel like Donald Trump is promoting and I do think it's important that we say hey we disagree with a lot of the personal moral choices that he's made and we can hold him accountable for that but at the same time we support him actually advancing our agenda whereas under Barack Obama we felt like there was a lot of antipathy towards evangelicals and so we didn't support him do you think there was antipathy because he said that they're all bible-thumping gun clinging ingrates and idiots basically and then he painted the White House in rainbow colors just cuz a little bit of that and Lois Lerner maybe just like a little bit of that so yeah I think I think that's probably what is I think they more see him and I don't want to objectify him but they almost see him as a tool to advance our agenda and a useful tool to advance our agenda more than they see him as a Ronald Reagan some stalwart of Christian values I think we all know that he's no choirboy but I think it's important also for evangelical leaders to make that distinction and to say that and maybe they haven't done a good job of that but to say it's hypocritical everyone is hypocritical everyone holds personal values that probably differ from any politician I would hope so that all the people that voted for Hillary Clinton don't think that all the things that she's done in her life are morally okay I kill that guy I don't know I'm not making any so I I just I just think it's silly it's just it's just a way for them once again to virtue signal to say there's no way that you can either be a religious or a good person and vote for Donald Trump and that's just not true yeah absolutely right well said I gotta let you get out of here yeah you're on CR TV you're the stuff you're putting out is fabulous it's really really good where can people find you so my podcast is every Wednesday it's called relatable you can find out iTunes SoundCloud all of that obviously
