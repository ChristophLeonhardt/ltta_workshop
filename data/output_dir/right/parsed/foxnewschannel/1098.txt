>> Julie: SO DEMOCRAT JOE
MANCHIN HINTING HE COULD SUPPORT
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 2020.
THE WEST VIRGINIA SENATOR FACING
A TOUGH RE-ELECTION BATTLE IN
NOVEMBER SAYS HE REGRETS BACKING
HILLARY CLINTON IN 2016.
HE TELLS POLITCO, I'M OPEN TO
SUPPORTING THE FIRST WHO I THINK
IS BEST FOR MY COUNTRY AND MY
STATE.
IF HIS POLICIES ARE BEST, I'LL
BE RIGHT THERE.
JOINING US NOW, FORMER
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR
SENATOR MARCH RUBIO, ISAAC
WRIGHT.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE TODAY.
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.
>> Julie: YOU AS A DEMOCRAT,
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF MANCHIN'S
HINT OF SUPPORTING PRESIDENT
TRUMP?
>> BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PEOPLE
LIKE JOE MANCHIN AND WASHINGTON
POLITICIANS, WHETHER YOU AGREE
WITH HIM OR NOT, JOE MANCHIN
TELLS YOU WHAT HE THINKS, WHERE
HE STANDS.
THAT'S WHY HE'S BEEN SO
SUCCESSFUL.
HE STOOD UP FOR THE ISSUES IN
WEST VIRGINIA OVER AND OVER
AGAIN AGAINST WASHINGTON NO
MATTER WHAT THE POLITICAL PRICE.
HE TELLS YOU HOW HE FEELS, TELLS
YOU WHAT HE BELIEVES.
HE STICKS BY IT.
>> AS A DEMOCRAT, DO YOU SUPPORT
HIM SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT?
>> I SUPPORT RETAKING THE SENATE
MAJORITY.
I THINK JOE MANCHIN WILL FIGHT
FOR THE PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA
AND DO IT IN GOOD CONSCIOUS.
WHEN THE RUBBER HIT THE ROAD AND
DONALD TRUMP PUT UP A TAX PLAN
TO SABOTAGE AMERICAN HEALTHCARE
THAT HAS LED TO MILLIONS LOSING
THEIR HEALTHCARE, UP TO 33
MILLION MORE LOSING THEIR
HEALTHCARE, THE TAX CODE SAYING
80% WILL GO TO THE WEALTHIER,
JOE MANCHIN TOLD HIM NO.
AT THE SAME TIME, HE WORKED FOR
THE PRESIDENT ON OTHER ISSUES.
MAYBE HE CAN REIN IN THE BAD
IDEAS.
>> Julie: ALEX IS THIS THE CASE
OF BUYER'S REMORSE?
>> NO.
WHAT WE HEARD IS A GOOD SPIN.
THAT'S WHAT JOE MANCHIN IS DOING
RIGHT NOW.
MANCHIN OPPOSED PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S AGENDA, VOTED AGAINST
THE TAX CUTS, REPEALING AND
REPLACING OBAMACARE AND NOW
FACING A TOUGH RE-ELECTION
BECAUSE HE'S TOO LIBERAL FOR THE
STATE, OUT OF STEP WITH TRUMP
WHO IS WILDLY POPULAR.
SO NOW HE'S SAYING THE NICE
THINGS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT,
SAYING HE MIGHT SUPPORT HIM IN
2020.
I WOULD WELCOME HIS SUPPORT.
IT WOULD BE A BIG DEAL FOR
HAVING MANCHIN SUPPORTING HIM.
BUT LET'S BE CLEAR, MANCHIN IS
PLAYING POLITICS.
>> Julie: OR IS HE A CHAMELEON?
IT IS JUST SURPRISING TO HEAR
THAT MANCHIN WILL ACTUALLY
CAMPAIGN AGAINST A REPUBLICAN
AND BELIEVE THAT DEMOCRATS ARE
GOING TO BUY THAT HE HIMSELF IS
GOING TO FOLLOW IN LINE WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN HE'S BEEN
OF COURSE, A BIG SUPPORTER OF
COAL MINERS.
HE APPLAUDED THE STATE OF THE
UNION ADDRESS.
HE BACKED GINA HASPEL.
HE MADE A NUMBER OF MOVES AWAY
FROM TRUMP LIKE OPPOSING
OBAMACARE REFORM AND TAX REFORM.
HOW ARE DEMOCRATS --
>> HE OPPOSED OBAMACARE
SABOTAGE.
HE OPPOSED THE SABOTAGE OF
HEALTHCARE FOR 33 MILLION
AMERICANS.
HE OPPOSED RESTRUCTURING THE TAX
CODE IN A WAY THAT DEVASTATES
WORKING WEST VIRGINIANS.
WHETHER IT'S D, R, WHATEVER
WASHINGTON WANTS TO SAY, JOE
MANCHIN STANDS UP FOR THE PEOPLE
OF WEST VIRGINIA.
IN THE END, THAT WILL COUNT.
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.
PEOPLE WILL IDENTIFY WITH THAT,
NOT WITH A NEW JERSEY LOBBYIST
MOVED TO WEST VIRGINIA TO TURN
POLITICIAN.
>> Julie: GO AHEAD, ALEX.
>> LOOK, YOU'RE HERING THE
ATTACKS ON PATRICK MORRISEY.
VERY WELL-RESPECTED IN WEST
VIRGINIA, RUNNING A STRONG
CAMPAIGN AND WILL PROBABLY
WIN --
>> WELL-RESPECTED BY THE OPIOID
LOBBY.
>> HOWEVER, JOE MANCHIN IS
PLAYING POLITICS HERE.
HE VOTED AGAINST THE PRESIDENT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND FACING A
TOUGH CHALLENGE AND NOW HE LOVES
THE PRESIDENT.
THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE HAD A ABOUT
WASHINGTON D.C. AND WHY THEY
DON'T LIKE POLITICIANS.
>> Julie: IT IS POLITICS --.
>> WEST VIRGINIA IS THE APEX
FROM THE OPIOID CRISIS, THIS IS
A PHARMACEUTICALS --
>> Julie: IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD
FOR MANCHIN.
THE REPUBLICAN IS OBVIOUSLY
AHEAD THERE.
SO --
>> NOT ACCORDING TO THE LAST
PEOPLE.
55% APPROVAL RATINGS.
TRUMP IS 57% --
>> Julie: WE STILL HAVE MONTHS
AWAY.
IF WE LOOK AT THE PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION, THEN CANDIDATE TRUMP
WON THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA
BY MORE THAN 40 POINTS.
SO MAYBE HE'S GOING TO TRY TO
LATCH ON TO THE WINNER?
THAT'S THE WHOLE PART OF WHAT
WE'RE TRYING TO SAY.
>> AND OBAMA WAS OUTPERFORMED.
>> Julie: AND THE FACT THAT HE'S
GETTING BEHIND THE PRESIDENT IS
HELPING HIM.
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE IF DEMOCRATS
