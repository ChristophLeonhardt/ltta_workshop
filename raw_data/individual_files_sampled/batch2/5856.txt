day 606 of the Trump administration and it appears we are going to be covering yet another Brett Kavanaugh hearing next week but it's not the kind of hearing the Trump administration was expecting or looking forward to Brett Kavanaugh is path to the Supreme Court just got supremely complicated tonight the Senate Judiciary Committee announced it will hold a public hearing next Monday with Cavanaugh and his accuser dr. Christine Blasi Ford a college professor in California NBC News reports that Cavanaugh spent roughly nine hours inside the White House today and that a White House official described him as quote chomping at the bit to testify in an off-the-record interview with The Washington Post Ford alleged quote one summer in the early 1980s Cavanaugh and a friend both stumbling drunk corralled her into a bedroom during a gathering of teenagers at a house in Montgomery County Maryland while his friend watched she said Cavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her when she tried to scream she said he put his hand over her mouth I thought he might inadvertently kill me said Ford in an interview this morning her attorney spoke out about the allegation she clearly considers this an attempted rape she believes that if it were not for the severe intoxication of Brett Kavanaugh she would have been raped Miska it's your client willing to testify before the Judiciary Committee publicly and tell this story she is she's willing to do whatever it takes to get her story forth yes she has taken a polygraph she's a credible person these are serious allegations and again her client has now given an on-the-record interview with The Washington Post today for his part Cavanaugh issued another strong denial of the accusation with this statement quote this is a completely false allegation I have never done anything like what the accuser describes to her or to anyone because this never happened I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday he goes on to say I am willing to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation from 36 years ago and defend my integrity today President Trump was standing by his nominee and indicated he is willing to allow the process to move forward at its own pace judge Cavanaugh is one of the finest people that I've ever known he's an outstanding intellect and outstanding judge respected by everybody never had even a little blemish on his record the FBI has I think gone through a process six times with him over the years where he went to higher and higher positions he is somebody very special at the same time we want to go through a process we want to make sure everything is perfect everything is just right if it takes a little delay it'll take a little delay it shouldn't certainly be very much president's senior advisor Kellyanne Conway also made an appearance stressing if not leading the White House messaging about Cavanaugh's accuser let me make very clear on behalf of the president with him I've spoken at length about this so put aside all the nonsense it's on TV and in print from people couldn't possibly be a source familiar with his thinking she should not be ignored or insulted she should be heard members of the Senate Judiciary Committee now have one week to prepare for this next hearing this afternoon Republicans on the hill weighed in on the accuser and the next steps do you think that any of these claims are legitimate no I don't I think they're I think this woman whoever she is is mixed up and but I can't speak for her all I can say is no I don't do you believe dr. Ford I don't know enough about dr. Ford and her allegations yet to reach that kind of judgment if judge Kavanagh has lied about what happened that would be disqualified because there the person but you believe her story but he is still all fight to survive I'd have a hard time putting some money on the court that thought tried to rape somebody the Judiciary Committee's Democrats were pushing to delay this week's vote on Kavanagh before this they're now arguing for a closer examination of the allegation against Kavanagh before another hearing is held as a former prosecutor there's no way that I would put a crime victim on the stand without an investigation let alone a witness before the entire American people it's a disservice to her and a disservice to Judge Cavanaugh there should be a thorough FBI investigation especially when the two principals are contradicting each other why are the group of people who left this Supreme Court seat vacant with Merrick garland for over a year suddenly are so anxious to go ahead with these and the this process is really mind-boggling in my view and raises some issues with that let's bring in our leadoff panel on a busy Monday night Peter Baker chief White House correspondent for the New York Times Sam Stein politics editor for The Daily Beast and Cynthia auxin is back with us a former federal prosecutor and a veteran of the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department good evening and welcome to you all Cynthia you're the lawyer here so I'd like to begin with you first of all let's talk about your takeaway from what is known thus far and the possible optics of next Monday with the GOP side made up of 11 white males on the Judiciary Committee well let's start first with the case itself I was a sex crimes prosecutor that's the way I started as a prosecutor and I and I've looked at hundreds of those cases over my career and it really is a base credibility balancing and we won't be able to know that until she testifies and that's why it's so disturbing that somebody like senator hatch would already announced that he doesn't believe her because he's never spoken to her he's never read her statement he doesn't know anything about her polygraph he doesn't know anything about her statement to her husband or to the psychiatrist or anybody else she ever spoke to about this before it was released so it it's hard to believe that he could be allowed to make a credibility determination since he's already made up his mind but that's the job here of the people on the committee and and I would agree with Senator from Hawaii that this should have been happened by the FBI first before they go forth and have this public hearing but it is going to be a credibility balancing act her credibility with the prior consistent statements and the polygraph which is very unusual in a case like this we don't polygraph rape victims ever so you would never have a rape case or an attempted rape case or a sexual assault case with a polygraph because we just never do that so that's interesting judge Kavanagh has had trouble in this hearing with credibility Senator Leahy has accused him of being untruthful with a committee so it's all gonna play out on the credibility front so Cynthia I have a dual question for you number one year I've not known you to be a political person you think it would be standard operating procedure or something close to it to have the FBI come in well I think the FBI should come in you never have a criminal case where you do the first thing you do is put all the witnesses on the stand in front of the jury that's not the way that that's not the way our criminal justice system that's no way our justice system works first there's an investigation by people who are specialized in doing investigations and then their discussion with the police or the FBI and actually in rape cases more often the police because it's usually a state crime but you would have a discussion between the prosecutor and the investigating agencies and you make a decision about how to go forward and they spend time with the victim and you'd figure out what to do next you don't just throw everybody on national television that's a dumb way to do an investigation and it doesn't serve Judge Cavanaugh well and it doesn't serve the victim well and Cynthia here's here's part 19 of my original three-part question then we'll move on to you gentlemen when Lindsey Graham kind of skeptically says on Sean Hannity as he did tonight that she hired an attorney in August paid for a polygraph in August he's just surprised that she wasn't planning to share her story all along what's to come back to that it's just snarky that's what it is it's Lindsey Graham being a tad snarky and it's unnecessary and unhelpful I mean the question now is what happened not how it happened that it finally came to pass I mean the only smart thing to do if you're a lawyer and you're looking at this case is telling is to give her the advice well you're going to be taken through the wringer and let's try to make some steps in case this comes out as things inevitably do that we're prepared to battle that and and having a polygraph you know there's a lot of talk back and forth about polygraphs because of television and what people think about polygraphs as somebody whose polygraph tower had I don't do the polygraphs myself but who have used polygraphs in numerous cases they are a wonderful tool in in the prosecutors toolkit to figure out who is being deceitful and who isn't and I think it's amazing that she passed that polygraph in fact I would love it if maybe judge Kavanaugh wants to get on the we call it being in on the box maybe judge Kavanaugh wants to get on the box and while he's there let's ask him if he's gonna overturn roe v wade Wow Cynthia auxin II thank you Peter Baker on to you to what we witnessed at the White House today I think you'll agree that was as controlled and as on message as we've seen the president in recent memory what do you think is going on in the West Wing and in the residence tonight well listen you're right that's that was a president who was listening to his coaches listening to his advisors for a change they told him don't inflame it don't tweet about it don't attack the accuser don't make this worse than it is and in fact that's what he tried to do he still try to stay on the line that a lot of presidents would if they were under certain similar circumstances that is expressing your confidence in your nominee saying that you're willing to take a delay in the hearing in order to hear out the accuser and not not do anything to insult or or to you know further make this you know the polarized process it already is and it's you're right it's surprising because we haven't seen him do that very often it does suggest that he does have the capacity to do it when he chooses to but we'll see how long that lasts you know we it's tuned again again at 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m. tomorrow after he's watched Fox and Friends we'll see what the Twitter feed says Sam Stein to paraphrase the reporting of Ashley Parker of the Washington Post tonight quoting to intimates with the president they say he had no the president has never had a special connection or affinity with Cavanaugh if it comes to it he'll have to move on Sam to your knowledge is there a plan B well let me just say you know we spent all day reporting what a plan B might look like and theoretically you can invent you can envision it which is get Cavanaugh to withdraw his nomination perhaps before this public hearing on Monday install someone new try to push it through and if force comes to worse have a vote in the lame-duck session you'll still have the Senate Republican majority then that would be the plan B but from everything that I could get from my reporting talking to officials who are close to the White House officials in the White House they have no desire to go down that route and it's for two reasons one is they fundamentally believe that if they are to give in at this point on Cavanaugh it will invite further Democratic opposition to whoever is that replaces Cano in any other future Supreme Court nominee and secondarily in a crassly political calculation Trump knows that his reputation with conservatives hinges on two things one is an appetite for these political fights and the second is delivering them the type of conservative judges that they dream of and if you were to back away from Cavanaugh at this juncture he would be disappointing them on both those fronts right before 50 days before the midterm election so the White House is actually in a different type of mode they are not looking at Plan B's they are trying to rally the troops are trying to threaten lawmakers not to get wobbly they're looking for ways to assure some evangelical leaders who may have been getting wobbly and they're planning to forge ahead it depends what happens of course on Monday because it could all blow up in their faces hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click
