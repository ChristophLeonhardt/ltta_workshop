1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,639
>>ACCORDING TO VANITY FAIR,
STEVE BANNON, WHO YOU MIGHT KNOW

2
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:09,500
AS THE HEAD OF BREITBART NEWS OR
MORE IMPORTANTLY AS THE WHITE

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,130
SUPREMACIST ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT
DONALD TRUMP, IS APPARENTLY

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,060
CONSIDERED RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,060
AND I KNOW WHAT

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,519
YOU'RE THINKING, YOU LOOK AT
THAT PICTURE AND THERE'S NO WAY

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,039
HE WILL LAST LONG ENOUGH TO DO
THAT.

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,509
BUT LIKE DICK CHENEY HE

9
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:27,840
MIGHT ACTUALLY LIVE LONG ENOUGH.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,650
LET'S BREAK DOWN SOME OF THESE

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,879
QUOTES BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ONLY
THAT NEWS, THERE IS QUOTES ABOUT

12
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:34,570
ANIL TRUMP THAT ARE FASCINATING
--

13
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:47,149
>>YOU MIGHT THINK, WELL, HE
KNOWS TRUMP, HE KNOWS TRUMP IS

14
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:50,010
HAVING A HARD TIME, IT'S VERY
TIRING, IT'S A LOT OF WORK -- OR

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,089
IT'S ANY WORK -- SO MAYBE HE
THINKS HE JUST WON'T WANT TO RUN

16
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:56,719
AGAIN, BUT HE ALSO SAID IN
PRIVATE CONVERSATION --

17
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:08,880
>>SO HIGH UP IN HIS MIND ISN'T
THAT TRUMP WILL SIMPLY STEP DOWN

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,290
BUT THAT HE WILL BE REMOVED
EITHER BY HIS IMPEACHMENT OR HIS

19
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,460
OWN CABINET COMING TOGETHER AND
REMOVING HIM.

20
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,140
>>LET'S PAUSE THERE.

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,610
>>THAT'S SIGNIFICANT.

22
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,090
>>SUPER SIGNIFICANT.

23
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,090
WILL GET
BACK TO HIM THINKING HE COULD BE

24
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,760
PRESIDENT IN A MINUTE, BUT
BANNON NOW TALKING ABOUT THE

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,260
25TH AMENDMENT -- IT'S SUPER
INTERESTING TO ME THAT THE FIRST

26
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,300
PERSON WHO MENTIONS ALZHEIMER'S
IS ROGER STONE, NOW THERE'S A

27
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:40,500
SMALL MOVEMENT FOR THE 25TH
AMENDMENT, BLESS THEIR HEARTS,

28
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,030
BUT BANNON NOW TALKING ABOUT THE
25TH AMENDMENT?

29
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,290
WHERE IS HE

30
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,560
GOING WITH THIS?

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,310
ACTUALLY HE HAS
MORE QUOTES THERE, IT MAKES YOU

32
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,760
WONDER EITHER A) WHAT DOES
BANNON KNOW ABOUT TRUMP THAT WE

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,930
DON'T KNOW, OR B)

34
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,070
WHAT ARE THEY
SETTING UP HERE?

35
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,070
IS IT AN ESCAPE

36
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,070
HATCH?

37
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,510
>>AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE TO
BEAR IN MIND THAT I CAN'T THINK

38
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,429
OF ONE SINGLE REASON TO BELIEVE
A WORD BANNON HAS EVER SAID OR

39
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,690
WILL EVER SAY.

40
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,280
BUT HERE ARE
THINGS THAT VANITY FAIR IS

41
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
SAYING ABOUT BANNON --

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:26,400
>>THAT'S A DIFFERENT AGE THAN I
WOULD PUT ON HIM AS A

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,690
METAPHORICAL CHILD BUT IT'S
STILL VERY CHILDLIKE.

44
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,690
LOST A

45
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,710
STEP.

46
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,260
YOU CAN SAY THAT ABOUT AN
ATHLETE, MAY BE, AND HAVE IT BE

47
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,640
PHYSICAL, BUT IF YOU ARE TALKING
ABOUT A SENIOR CITIZEN LOSING A

48
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,640
STEP, I DON'T THINK YOU
MEAN PHYSICALLY.

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,050
I THINK YOU MEAN MENTALLY.

50
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,500
>>OF COURSE HE MEANS MENTALLY,
HE SAYS HE'S NOW THE MENTAL

51
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,069
EQUIVALENT OF AN 11-YEAR-OLD.

52
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:51,020
>>I THINK HE JUST MEANS THAT
HE'S FILLED WITH GLEE FOR THE

53
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,020
WORLD.

54
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,860
>>IT SOUNDS LIKE A FUN, KOOKY
STORY FROM STEVE BANNON, BUT

55
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,810
HERE'S A GUY WHO STILL TALKS TO
THE PRESIDENT FREQUENTLY, HE WAS

56
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,920
HIS CHIEF STRATEGIST BOTH ON THE
CAMPAIGN AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

57
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,190
THERE'S A REASON HE'S PUTTING
OUT STATEMENTS, AND IT'S NOT

58
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,970
LIKE HE'S NOT MEDIA SAVVY, HE
RUNS A MEDIA ORGANIZATION AND

59
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,580
PRIDES HIMSELF ON BEING MEDIA
SAVVY.

60
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,580
AND HE'S TALKING TO

61
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,290
PEOPLE ABOUT HOW THE PRESIDENT
HAS LOST A STEP, IS LIKE AN

62
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,010
11-YEAR-OLD, THEY MIGHT USE THAT
WHEN HE FIFTH AMENDMENT ON HIM.

63
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,040
LARGELY PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT
IMPEACHMENT, HE BRINGS IN THE

64
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,300
25TH AMENDMENT.

65
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,930
I'M TELLING YOU,
THERE ARE ONLY TWO REASONS

66
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,670
THAT'S POSSIBLE, ONE, TRUMP HAS
LOST HIS MIND AND EVERYONE, EVEN

67
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,830
STEVE BANNON, KNOWS IT.

68
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,569
BUT I
SEE HIM TODAY AND HE LOOKS JUST

69
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:38,890
AS STUPID TODAY AS HE DID A YEAR
OR TWO AGO.

70
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,890
BANNON IS NOT

71
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,631
STUPID, HE'S GOT A LOT OF
PROBLEMS, STUPIDITY IS NOT ONE

72
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:49,819
OF THEM, HE'S DOING THIS FOR
STRATEGY WHATEVER THE REASONS.

73
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:53,310
THE SECOND REASON IS, HE KNOWS
AND TRUMP KNOWS THEY ARE GOING

74
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,270
TO GET HIM, IF YOU ARE IN HIS
BANK ACCOUNT AT DEUTSCHE BANK

75
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,520
YOU WILL GET HIM.

76
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,250
IF MUELLER
GETS HIM, THEY NEED AN ESCAPE

77
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,250
HATCH.

78
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:08,110
THE ESCAPE HATCH IS,
DEMENTIA, ALZHEIMER'S, HE HAD TO

79
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,459
STEP DOWN.

80
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:11,950
YOU KNOW THAT'S MY
THEORY.

81
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:17,358
>>I THOUGHT EARLIER IN THE
CAMPAIGN BEFORE HE WON HE MIGHT

82
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,458
STEP DOWN IF HE THOUGHT HE WAS
GOING TO LOSE, BUT IF HE THOUGHT

83
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,060
HE WOULD BE TAKEN DOWN, TO ME IF
THE OPTIONS ARE STEP DOWN AND

84
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,030
TRY TO SAVE FACE -- HE DOESN'T
EVEN REALLY HAVE THAT UNDER THIS

85
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,110
BECAUSE STEPPING DOWN BECAUSE
YOU'RE CRAZY ISN'T RELEASE

86
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,139
SAVING FACE -- VESUS LASHING OUT
AT THOSE COMING FOR YOU, TRUMP

87
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,919
SEEMS LIKE THE LASH OUT GUY AS
OPPOSED TO THE STEP DOWN GUY.

88
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:38,919
AT

89
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:40,020
THIS POINT WE HAVE TO
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EITHER ONE OF

90
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,360
THOSE OUTCOMES IN THE SHORT TERM
ARE A FAIRLY LOW PROBABLY,

91
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:52,720
IMPEACHMENT OR THAT 25TH
AMENDMENT.

92
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,889
>>NOT ACCORDING TO BANNON.

93
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:02,330
>>HE KNOWS A LOT OF THINGS
ABOUT TRUMP THAT WE DON'T KNOW.

94
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,509
HE WAS WITH HIM THROUGH
ALL THOSE TIMES.

95
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:08,810
AND HE SAYS HE ONLY HAS A 30%
CHANCE OF SERVING OUT HIS TERM.

96
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,499
>>HE ALSO APPARENTLY SAID THAT
DESPITE THESE INSULTS AGAINST

97
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:15,819
TRUMP HE THINKS THAT TRUMP IS,
WHAT WAS THE ACTUAL QUOTE?

98
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:16,819
HE'S

99
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:20,499
THE GREATEST ORATOR SINCE
WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN.

100
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:21,499
WHICH

101
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:23,849
GETS INTO PENCE TERRITORY.

102
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:26,330
NO
HE'S NOT.

103
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,330
IT'S LIKE WILLIAM

104
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,330
JENNINGS BRYAN, TAYLOR SWIFT,
DONALD TRUMP.

105
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,410
DOWN HERE.

106
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,500
HE HAS

107
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,280
OTHER THINGS TO SAY BECAUSE WE
WILL HAVE THEIR REACTION TO THIS

108
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,660
REPORTING AND A SECOND BUT
UNDERSTAND THAT STEVE

109
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,280
BANNON, TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF
AND WHAT HE CAN DO, HE SAYS --

110
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,259
>>DRIVE THEM OFF A CLIFF.

111
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,400
AND
HE CAN.

112
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,620
HE HAS SUPPORTED SOME

113
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,129
CANDIDATES THAT HAVE GONE ON TO
LOSE, HE CHOSE TO STICK WITH ROY

114
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:55,960
MOORE AND THAT MADE BREITBART I
THINK LOOK RIDICULOUS, BUT HE

115
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,090
DID IT -- THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE
DOESN'T HAVE POWER THOUGH.

116
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,090
IN

117
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,800
RESPONSE TO THIS REPORTING
COMING OUT OF VANITY FAIR,

118
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
BANNON'S SPOKESPERSON SAID --

119
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:18,710
>>THE PRESIDENT WHO IS AN
11-YEAR-OLD CHILD.

120
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,039
>>FINALLY, IF STEVE BANNON WERE
TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, IS THAT A

121
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,599
LEGITIMATE THREAT?

122
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:27,050
TRUMP WON, SO
IS IT REMOTELY POSSIBLE?

123
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,050
NO.

124
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,569
>>I TWEETED PLEASE GOD, I BEG
YOU, RUN FOR PRESIDENT.

125
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:34,589
>>AT THE TIME PEOPLE WERE
SAYING THAT ABOUT TRUMP I WAS

126
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:37,710
NOT, I WAS SAYING BE CAREFUL
WHAT YOU WISH FOR BECAUSE A

127
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,949
POPULIST IS VERY LIKELY TO WIN.

128
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,270
BUT A POPULIST THAT WAS A TV

129
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,969
STAR, REALITY STAR, FOR DECADES,
AND THAT IS KNOWN BY ALL MOST

130
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:50,869
EVERY AMERICAN, IS ONE THING.

131
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:54,940
THIS GUY WHO IS OUTWARDLY RACIST

132
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:02,050
AND A LOT OF THE THINGS HE SAYS,
THAT IS NOT WELL-LIKED -- YES

133
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:08,289
AMONG HIS ALT-RIGHT FOLLOWERS HE
MIGHT BE POP A SMURF, BUT TO THE

134
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:10,419
REST OF THE COUNTRY, I CAN'T
BELIEVE I'M GOING TO FINISH THIS

135
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:13,009
ANALOGY, HE'S GARGAMEL.

136
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:16,749
>>I VAGUELY GET THAT REFERENCE.

137
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:17,819
JUST A LITTLE.

138
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:24,300
>>I THINK DICK CHENEY'S
POPULARITY ONCE DIPPED TO 9%, SO

139
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:30,379
THE EVIL GUY BEHIND THE GUY, THE
SITH LORD, THE SNOKE, ISN'T

140
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:34,099
GOING TO WIN ELECTIONS, HE MIGHT
GET THE POWER IN OTHER ROUTES AS

141
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:37,960
STEVE BANNON DID, THAT'S WHY I'M
NOT DERIDING HIS INTELLIGENCE,

142
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,610
BUT IF YOU THINK SNOKE CAN WIN
AN ELECTION -- I'M ONTO STAR

143
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:47,750
WARS NOW -- IF PEOPLE WHO SAY
YES, I HATE THE OTHER SIDE --

144
00:07:47,750 --> 00:00:00,000
>>WAS THAT GARGAMEL?
