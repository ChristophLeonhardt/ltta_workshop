musicians have always been on the front line pushing against the establishment the counterculture the punks the rebels the madmen however it seems like now most artists are no more boundary-pushing than any late-night host you see on TV or more just a guitar carrying mouthpiece for the mainstream media everyone just saying the exact same thing however one rock legend ban refuses to stand in line for the cameras and the liberal elites and they are rock stars I've been to Hollywood Paul Stanley one of the lead vocalist for one of the most iconic classic rock bands of all time kiss made headlines after they paused their concert to say how great it is to support the military how it's cool to be patriotic and gave a rocking version of the national anthem Paul Stanley said quote you should remember patriotism is always cool loving your country is always cool standing up respecting and honoring our military is always cool rock on before he also donated a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to a military foundation and they absolutely rock out a version of the national anthem it's fantastic now you may think that this is not counterculture this isn't edgy this isn't brave really what would happen if imagine dragons stood up and said yeah you should all stand for the national anthem or what would happen if Justin Bieber said yeah it's okay to support the president or what if you're Taylor Swift and just don't talk about politics at all and because of that you're berated or what if a rapper said hey you don't have to live like a victim oh wait Kanye did say that and the Sharks came in the water and named me one of the band willing to not go step in step with the mainstream narrative you see what I mean it's not edgy for ariana grande to do what her managers or record label executives tell her to do while they're living in the Hollywood Hills producing a song and music video called God as a woman that has intended to smash the patriarchy it's not edgy for jay-z and Beyonce to have the entire world worship at their fevered dancing in front of great historical art at the Louvre trying to show how black bodies and art have been pushed aside for the more white mainstream art culture sorry guys you ain't edgy and you're not rebels you're not the counterculture you're mainstream it's not brave when the whole leftist run media and entertainment outlets around the world will praise you and worship at your feet for saying what they want you to say what kiss did was edging it's the way that rock bands should be an individual making art for what they believe in in spite of the potential backlash or the audience not liking it as much now I'm not saying that all musicians should be like this many artists or band members can do their own thing and refuse to support different things or say whatever they want but what I'm saying is when every single rapper or rock or pop artist I'll say and believe the exact same thing you're no longer a band you're more like a cog in the mainstream machine and you then are allowed to perform and play and have airtime on the radio because you're saying exactly what the mainstream culture wants you to say and that's not edgy rock on kiss I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood in awesome news like super awesome news you can now download the rebel media app and you can take me with you and have access to the entire rebel lineup
