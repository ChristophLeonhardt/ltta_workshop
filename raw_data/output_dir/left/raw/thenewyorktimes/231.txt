1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,320
Our Milky Way galaxy
is strewn with billions

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:10,380
of planets, alien worlds
still unseen by human eyes —

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,970
at least for now.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,640
Only three decades
ago we didn’t know

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,818
if there were planets
beyond our own solar system.

6
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:24,410
In 1995, astronomers
discovered that a star

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,740
in the constellation Pegasus
was wobbling back and forth,

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,387
tugged by the gravity of an
unseen planet, an exoplanet,

9
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:39,630
a hot and hellish world
unfit for life as we know it.

10
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,060
The wobble method
of planet hunting

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,240
relies on sensitive
spectroscopes.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,020
As an orbiting planet tugs
on its star, the starlight

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,090
we see shifts from blue
to red and back again.

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,980
The Kepler space telescope
was launched in 2009.

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,180
It found thousands of exoplanets
by staring at a small patch

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,720
of the Milky Way.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,200
Kepler didn’t look for wobbles.

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,700
It looked for small
dips in starlight,

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,350
when a planet crosses
in front of its star.

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,760
Kepler found systems of planets,
groups of worlds swirling

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:24,270
around their star, lonely
planets encased in ice,

22
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,840
other worlds scorched
by fire, newborn planets

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,580
shrouded in dust,
waterworlds, and planets

24
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,890
swept by global storms,
planets dancing in orbit

25
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,630
with two stars, or even
three, and even planets

26
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:49,060
from other galaxies that were
swallowed up by the Milky Way.

27
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,520
In recent years,
astronomers have

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,290
taken the first direct images
of exoplanets, blurry pixels

29
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,320
of alien landscapes.

30
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,600
We’ve discovered a free-floating
planet not bound to any star.

31
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,860
And we’ve seen signs
of planets being born,

32
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,975
infant worlds scoring dark rings
in the dust around their stars.

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,290
Now a new planet hunter
will join the search.

34
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,690
On April 16, 2018, the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey

35
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,420
Satellite, or TESS, will
lift off from Cape Canaveral.

36
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,580
TESS will spend two years
scrutinizing the entire sky,

37
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,340
watching nearby
stars for minute dips

38
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,270
in brightness caused by
a nearby alien world.

39
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:49,350
TESS’ four cameras cover a swath
of the sky 96 degrees tall.

40
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,020
TESS will divide the
sky into sections

41
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,050
like the slices of
an orange and stare

42
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,930
at each section for 27 days,
then move on to the next.

43
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:06,200
After two years we will
have covered the whole sky.

44
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,580
TESS will fly an unusual orbit,
swooping as far out as the moon

45
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,340
every two weeks before
falling back close to Earth

46
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,650
and dumping a torrent of
data to eager astronomers.

47
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,440
TESS is a target hunter.

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,700
The planets it
finds can be studied

49
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,760
by the next generation
of telescopes on Earth

50
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,860
and in space.

51
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,110
With luck TESS will
discover worlds

52
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,920
suitable for lakes and
oceans, with rich atmospheres

53
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,150
and chemical signals
we can detect.

54
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,420
Their gases could tell
us whether these planets

55
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,900
are habitable or inhabited
by the likes of us.

56
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,820
The Milky Way holds more planets
than stars and a diversity

57
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,860
that we still haven’t
begun to plumb

58
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,670
In the search for life
and meaning in the cosmos,

59
00:03:57,670 --> 00:00:00,000
our own world is still
the gold standard.
