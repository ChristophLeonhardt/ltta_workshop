1
00:00:02,282 --> 00:00:04,418
PROMISES TO SURRENDER HIS

2
00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:05,586
NUCLEAR PROGRAM IF PRESIDENT

3
00:00:05,586 --> 00:00:06,520
TRUMP PROMISES NOT TO INVADE.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,525
THAT WAS PART OF WHAT WAS

5
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:13,093
REVEILED.

6
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:14,128
GENERAL JACK KEANE.

7
00:00:14,128 --> 00:00:15,429
JOHN BOLTON ANSWERED QUESTIONS.

8
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:17,064
HE BELIEVES THE MEETING WILL

9
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:19,366
HAPPEN.

10
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:21,902
ONE OF THE QUIBBLES WHERE DOES

11
00:00:21,902 --> 00:00:22,603
IT HAPPEN.

12
00:00:22,603 --> 00:00:25,072
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE THIS

13
00:00:25,072 --> 00:00:28,108
MEETING TAKES PLACE IF KIM

14
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:31,679
GIVES UP HIS NICK LAR PROGRAM.

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,851
>> I THINK THEY'RE LOOKING AT

16
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:38,218
SINGAPORE.

17
00:00:38,218 --> 00:00:39,687
KIM JONG-UN DOESN'T LIKE TO

18
00:00:39,687 --> 00:00:40,020
TRAVEL.

19
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,589
THEY'LL AGREE ON A PLACE AND

20
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:42,656
TIME BECAUSE THESE TWO LEADERS

21
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:45,125
WANT THIS TO TAKE PLACE.

22
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,795
I THINK THE FRAMEWORK CERTAINLY

23
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:49,897
FROM OUR POSITION IS VERY CLEAR.

24
00:00:49,897 --> 00:00:52,066
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO

25
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:54,101
DISCUSS CERTAINLY.

26
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:57,638
U.S. HOSTAGES.

27
00:00:57,638 --> 00:00:58,839
JAPANESE ABDUCTIES AND

28
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:00,474
BALLISTIC MISSILES AND ONE

29
00:01:00,474 --> 00:01:02,443
CENTRAL ISSUE FOREMOST ON THE

30
00:01:02,443 --> 00:01:08,449
MIND OF THE UNITED STATES,

31
00:01:08,449 --> 00:01:09,016
COMPLETE VERIFIABLE

32
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:10,351
DENUCLEARIZATION, THE CENTRAL

33
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:10,784
ISSUE.

34
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:12,453
WHAT KIM WILL LIKELY DO, DON'T

35
00:01:12,453 --> 00:01:13,854
KNOW FOR SURE.

36
00:01:13,854 --> 00:01:17,124
HE MAY WANT TO DRAG THIS OUT

37
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:18,892
OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS FROM

38
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:20,661
FREEZE TO DISARM, GET ECONOMIC

39
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:22,763
SANCTIONS AND THEN IF HE IS

40
00:01:22,763 --> 00:01:24,398
PLAYING US, THEN HE IS LIKELY

41
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:26,033
TO HOLD ON TO SOME OF HIS

42
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:28,135
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AT THE END.

43
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:29,570
WE WON'T BUY INTO THAT AND

44
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,237
ACCEPT THAT.

45
00:01:30,237 --> 00:01:31,872
>> Bill: I WANT TO SHOW YOU A

46
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:33,073
CLIP OF THE VIDEO FROM LAST

47
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:35,175
FRIDAY THAT I FIND THE MOST

48
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:35,576
INTRIGUING.

49
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:37,745
HERE IS A MAN NOW SAUNTERING

50
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:39,947
ACROSS THE BORDER, HE IS YOUNG.

51
00:01:39,947 --> 00:01:41,949
HE LOOKS ENTIRELY COMFORTABLE.

52
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:44,518
HE CLEARLY HAS PERSONALITY AND

53
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:46,086
HE -- HE IS ENTIRELY

54
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:47,321
COMFORTABLE WITH WHO HE IS.

55
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:49,223
I DON'T THINK THE WORLD HAS

56
00:01:49,223 --> 00:01:50,858
EVER SEEN HIM LIKE THAT BEFORE,

57
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:51,191
GENERAL.

58
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:54,595
>> I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF

59
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:55,529
MISINTERPRETATION ABOUT KIM

60
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,431
JONG-UN, ONE, BECAUSE OF HIS

61
00:01:57,431 --> 00:02:01,068
YOUTH, TWO, BECAUSE OF HIS

62
00:02:01,068 --> 00:02:06,440
BELLICOSE NATURE AND OUTRAGEOUS

63
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,408
STATEMENT HE MADE RAINING DEATH

64
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:09,008
ON AMERICA.

65
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:11,145
THE CIA HAS THE BEST PROFILE ON

66
00:02:11,145 --> 00:02:11,412
HIM.

67
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:13,547
THE DIRECTOR OF THE C.I.A., MR.

68
00:02:13,547 --> 00:02:14,882
POMPEO, MET WITH HIM AND I

69
00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:16,517
BELIEVE THE REASON WHY THERE IS

70
00:02:16,517 --> 00:02:18,619
OPTIMISM IN THE WHITE HOUSE --

71
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:21,689
NOT OVER THE CHARTS OPTIMISM.

72
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:23,524
CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM IS THIS,

73
00:02:23,524 --> 00:02:24,458
BECAUSE I THINK AFTER POMPEO

74
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,360
MET WITH HIM HE CAME BACK AND

75
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,863
TOLD THE PRESIDENT LOOK AT, I

76
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:32,933
THINK THIS GUY IS SERIOUS.

77
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,969
HE UNDERSTANDS KIM JONG-UN

78
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:37,371
BASED ON THE INTELLIGENCE

79
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:37,838
C.I.A. ACT.

80
00:02:37,838 --> 00:02:40,674
HE BELIEVES THAT KIM JONG-UN IS

81
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:41,642
A RATIONAL ACTOR AND BELIEVE HE

82
00:02:41,642 --> 00:02:42,910
IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT

83
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,277
DIRECTION.

84
00:02:43,277 --> 00:02:44,678
BUT THEY HAVE TO HAVE EVIDENCE.

85
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:46,313
AND THAT EVIDENCE IS NOT GOING

86
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:47,881
TO BE THERE UNTIL WE ACTUALLY

87
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:48,882
GET INTO THE MEETING.

88
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:51,452
LOOK AT ALL THE STEPS HE IS

89
00:02:51,452 --> 00:02:54,388
TAKING TO CONVINCE US THAT THIS

90
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:55,089
IS REAL.

91
00:02:55,089 --> 00:02:57,191
HAVING A MEETING WITH MR. MOON,

92
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:58,358
THE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA.

93
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:00,461
THE DESIRE TO END THE WAR.

94
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:02,262
JUST RECENTLY OVER THIS WEEKEND

95
00:03:02,262 --> 00:03:04,665
HE SAID LOOK AT, THE INSPECTORS

96
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:07,167
CAN COME IN MAY AND LOOK AT MY

97
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:08,435
CLOSED NUCLEAR TEST SITE IF

98
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:09,369
THEY WANT TO.

99
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:11,905
SO HE IS TRYING TO LAY ONE SHOE

100
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:13,807
AFTER ANOTHER TO MAKE CERTAIN

101
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:15,242
THAT THE UNITED STATES

102
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:17,177
UNDERSTANDS I'M SEAROUS.

103
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:18,646
>> Bill: DOES THAT FACILITY IN

104
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:20,080
THE NORTH EVEN WORK?

105
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,749
I KNOW WHAT HE SAID BUT I DON'T

106
00:03:21,749 --> 00:03:23,050
KNOW WHAT THEY'LL FIND WHEN

107
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,517
THEY GET THERE.

108
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:25,152
THE POINT YOU MAKE IS VERY

109
00:03:25,152 --> 00:03:26,320
IMPORTANT, I THINK FOR OUR

110
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,656
VIEWERS AS WE GO THROUGH THIS

111
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:28,989
PROCESS.

112
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:30,558
THAT ISN'T GOING TO LAST A

113
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:31,025
MONTH, GENERAL.

114
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:32,893
THIS WILL GO ON FOR MONTHS IF

115
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:34,528
NOT YEARS, YOU WOULD AGREE WITH

116
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:34,995
THAT, CORRECT?

117
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:35,896
>> ABSOLUTELY.

118
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:38,732
>> Bill: AS WE WATCH THAT

119
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:39,967
PROCESS IS HE GIVEN A LITTLE IN

120
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:42,069
ORDER TO FEED HIS PEOPLE AND

121
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:44,204
GET THE TRADE SANCTIONS LIFTED

122
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:47,741
A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME WHERE HE

123
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:49,143
PRESERVES ULTIMATELY A PIECE,

124
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:51,045
BE IT SMALL OR LARGE, OF HIS

125
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:52,780
OWN NUCLEAR PROGRAM FOR HIMSELF

126
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,215
AS A BARGAINING CHIP DOWN THE

127
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:55,683
ROAD?

128
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:58,052
OTHERWISE I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH

129
00:03:58,052 --> 00:03:59,687
OF IT EVEN MAKES SENSE FOR A

130
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:02,022
GUY WHO LIVED HIS LIFE TO BUILD

131
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:02,756
THIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM TO

132
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:05,092
SURRENDER IT AND GIVE IT UP.

133
00:04:05,092 --> 00:04:06,060
LAST WORD.

134
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,963
>> THAT COULD BE HIS STRATEGY

135
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:10,364
TO DRAG IT OUT AND GET

136
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:10,864
SOMETHING BACK.

137
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:12,733
THE UNITED STATES WON'T BUY

138
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:13,434
THAT.

139
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:16,170
WE'LL WANT TO GO QUICKLY,

140
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,805
FREEZE, DISARM, DISMANTLE AND

141
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:20,574
DO IT AT BEST OVER A YEAR AND A

142
00:04:20,574 --> 00:00:00,000
HALF AND TWO YEARS.
