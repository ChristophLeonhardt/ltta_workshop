1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,670
- My name is Jesse,
and I wanted to ask you

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,670
about Spanish language mainstream
meet conservative media.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,330
So at this point in 2018, we
still have over 41 million

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,100
Spanish speakers all
across the United States,

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,230
second only to Mexico in
terms of Spanish speaking

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,740
population worldwide, 15
million in California.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,580
Yet we still don't have any
kind of conservative media

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,590
in Spanish on any kind of mainstream

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,670
or even alternate media basis.

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,280
There's only very
disparate YouTube channels

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,830
or Facebook pages and what have you.

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,810
I was wondering two things.

13
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,960
One is why is this still the case?

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,160
Second, I was wondering
if you and Daily Wire

15
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,030
would be interested in
being able to make a shift

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,570
in the culture and a shift in our country

17
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,640
in being pioneers in this venture,

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,500
and was wondering if I
could partner with you?

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,430
I grew up as a Christian
missionary kid in Lima, Peru

20
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,640
in South America, so I'm a US
citizen and grew up overseas,

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,280
dual citizen of US and Peru.

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,870
I'm fully bilingual in
English and Spanish,

23
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,690
also in French as well 'cause
I was a missionary in France.

24
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,960
- Yeah, the answer to your question

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,520
is absolutely, send us a resume.

26
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,563
Conservatism is not
limited to one language.

27
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,970
(audience cheering)

28
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,370
When I spoke at the
California Republican Party,

29
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:11,610
I gave the keynote address
to the California Convention

30
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,960
probably five years ago,
I actually suggested

31
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,810
that everybody in the room
ought to try learning Spanish.

32
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,740
I'm working on it right now,

33
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,640
I've been working on it
for years, I keep failing,

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,360
but that doesn't mean that
we shouldn't be reaching out

35
00:01:20,360 --> 00:00:00,000
in other languages, so yes,
send us a resume, absolutely.
