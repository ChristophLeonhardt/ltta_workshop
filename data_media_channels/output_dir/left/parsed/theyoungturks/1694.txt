THE TRIP IN MINISTRATION IS
ANNOUNCED A NEW CRACKDOWN ON
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES CROSSING THE
BORDER AND IN DOING SO THEY ARE
SHOWING A WILLINGNESS TO
PROSECUTE AND EVEN SEPARATE
FAMILIES THAT WE HAVE RARELY
SEEN IN RECENT HISTORY.
UP UNTIL RIGHT NOW, CROSSING
THE BORDER ILLEGALLY IS A
MISDEMEANOR PUNISHABLE BY UP TO
SIX MONTHS 
IN JAIL.
IN THEORY THEY COULD OF BEEN
LOCKED UP BUT IT WAS NOT
TYPICALLY THE CASE THAT WOULD
HAPPEN.
ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN AREAS.
IT 
REALLY DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING
WHEN YOU GET DONE WITH THE
SENTENCE.
THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING BY 
THE
WAY.
WHICH IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF
THING THAT WOULD PROTECT HER
FAMILY FROM BEING SEPARATED
HOWEVER NOW IT WILL NOT.
IN SAN DIEGO THEY DID NOT TARGET
FAMILIES LIKE THIS.
THAT IS APPARENTLY NOT THE CASE
PREVIOUSLY BUT NOW THEY ARE
GOING TO BE DOING THAT.
>>SO THEY ARE WASTING A
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF
TAXPAYER MONEY ON PEOPLE WHO ARE
NOT DANGEROUS.
THE PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE TO LET
THE KIDS GO IN THREE WEEKS.
IT WAS PREVIOUSLY NOT A PROBLEM
UNTIL THE TRUMPET MINISTRATION
SAYS I WOULD LIKE TO LOCK UP
THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS FOR LONGER
EVEN THOUGH WHAT THEY ARE DOING
IS AT BEST A MISDEMEANOR BY
CROSSING THE BORDER.
IN SOME CASES THEY ARE TRYING TO
SEEK ASYLUM.
BUT THEY SAY THAT YOU DIDN'T GO
TO THE RIGHT PORT OF ENTRY SO
I'M GOING TO IMPRISON YOU FOR
SIX MONTHS, THEN TAKE YOUR
KIDS AWAY AND RELEASE THEM IN
THREE WEEKS.
KNOWS WHERE YOUR KIDS ARE GOING
TO GO AND HOW LONG WE WILL
KEEP YOU IMPRISON.
BUT AS A WHOLE OTHER ISSUE TO
ADD.
JEFF SESSIONS SAYS THERE IS
NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER
MINISTRATIONS DID, YOU HAVE
A WHOLE SET OF CHOICES.
YOU ARE CHOOSING TO BREAK THIS
FAMILIES APART AND CHOOSING TO
BE DRACONIAN AND WASTE A
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OUR
RESOURCES FIGHTING PEOPLE WHO
ARE NOT DANGEROUS THEREBY ALSO
NOT SPENDING RESOURCES ON PEOPLE
WHO ARE DANGEROUS.
>>TO BE FAIR THIS IS ONE OF THE
AREAS WHERE THEY ARE VERY
CLEAR WHAT THEY WOULD DO.
I KNOW SOME PEOPLE WANT TO
BELIEVE THAT IT IS ALL THE
SAME ACROSS ADMINISTRATIONS BUT
SOME OF THE TRUMPETS AND HE
PUTS PEOPLE LIKE JEFF SESSIONS
THERE, HE KNOWS HIS BASE WANTS
HIM TO BE CRACKING DOWN ON THESE
PEOPLE, SO HE'S GOING TO DO IT.
HE'S WASTING TONS OF MONEY ALONG
THE WAY.
>> IMMIGRATION PROSECUTIONS
HAVE TAKEN UP ABOUT HALF THE
CRIMINAL DOCKET SINCE 2008.
BUSH CHANGE THE PROCEDURE THERE.
ALL OF A SUDDEN INSTEAD OF GOING
AFTER VIOLENT CRIMINALS THE
FEDERAL DOCKET IS FULL TO THE
BRIM WITH CRIMINALS
CROSSING THE BORDER.
BUT OBAMA DID NOT CHANGE THE
POLICY AND HE CONTINUED.
NOT TRUMP COMES IN AND PUTS 
IT
ON STEROIDS.
NOW WE ARE GOING TO WASTE EVEN
MORE MONEY.
AND BY THE WAY WHEN OUR
ANCESTORS DO?
MAYBE I'M EXEMPT
BECAUSE WE CAME OVER LEGALLY.
IF YOU ARE HERE IN AMERICA
EARLIER DID YOU COME WITH
PAPERS?
DID PILGRIMS HAVE
PAPERS?
I DON'T THINK SO.
SO NOW INSTEAD OF HAVING HALF OF
OUR FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR
PROSECUTION GOING TOWARDS THAT
WASTE OF MONEY WHICH COULD'VE
APPLIED TO ALMOST ALL OF US, WE
ARE NOW HAVING EVEN MORE
RESOURCES WASTED.
THE ONE PART I WILL AGREE
WITH JOHN ON 100%
IS THIS IS WHAT YOU VOTED FOR.
IT'S NOT LIKE HE DIDN'T SAY HE
WAS GOING TO GO AFTER
PEOPLE WHO CROSS THE BORDER.
HE SAID ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS.
IS GOING TO TRY TO CRUSH
FAMILIES IN SOME CASES ESCAPING
FROM OPPRESSION AND THEN
SPLIT THEIR FAMILIES APART.
REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID ABOUT
BOMBING PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE
EAST?
HE SAID THEY ARE
TERRORISTS.
BY THE WAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE
CIVILIANS NOT TERRORISTS
THAT WE KILLED.
ARE YOU SURPRISED IS GOING AFTER
PEOPLE'S FAMILY?
HE SAID HE
WOULD MURDER THE FAMILY MEMBERS
OF PEOPLE HE CONSIDERED
TERRORISTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST
AND HE SAID HE WOULD GO AFTER
PEOPLE CROSSING THE BORDER IN
DRACONIAN WAYS.
I GUESS MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
CONGRATULATIONS AMERICA.
