ABC AFTER LEAD ACTOR MADE SOME REMARKS ON TWITTER THAT SHE REGRETTED. FOR NOW OUR EYES ARE ON THE PRESIDENT WHO HAS ENJOYED RISING APPROVAL RATINGS AND INTERVENING MORE AND EARIVELY BEFORE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. MID TERMS TYPICALLY GO BADLY FOR THE INCUMBENT PARTY: WE ARE JOINT TONIGHT BY SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST BRIT HUME. WOULD THESE HELP THE CANDIDATE. THE CANDIDATE WHO IS. Tucker: FOR WHOM THE PRESIDENT IS STUMPING. I THINK IN THIS CASE. THE STATE OF TENNESSEE IS A STATE THAT THE PRESIDENT CARRIED EASILY. THERE IS A REASONABLY POPULAR CANDIDATE ON THE OTHER SIDE PHIL BRED SON WHO WAS GOVERNOR AND HAS BEEN WELL-REGARDED IN THE STATE. HE IS AHEAD IN WHAT FEW POLLS THERE ARE. SO, BUT MARSHA BLACKBURN HAS A REAL CHANCE TO TAKE THE SEAT FOR THE REPUBLICANS AND SHE WILL NEED THE SUPPORT OF THE TRUMP. SHE WILL CERTAINLY NEED THAT AND HIS BEING THERE HELPS WITH THAT OTHER THING ABOUT IT OF COURSE IS HE LOVES THIS. Tucker: HE DOES LOVE IT. NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. IN WASHINGTON HE FEELS COOPSD UP AND CRITICIZED AND KIND OF LIKE A MAN ON AN ISLAND AND HE GETS OUT TO THESE RALLIES WHERE HE PACKS THESE HUGE HOUSES AND ALL FULLY ADVANCED BY HIS TEAM AND PEOPLE COME AND CHEER WILDLY FOR HIM AND IT MAKES HIM FEEL GOOD BILL CLINTON WAS THE SAME WAY. HE GOT ENERGY FROM IT. PEOPLE WHO COVERED HIM ON HIS CAMPAIGN, WHICH I COVERED HIM AS PRESIDENT BUT NOT ON THE CAMPAIGN WOULD SAY AT THE END OF THE DAY, EVERYONE WOULD BE EXHAUSTED AND HE SEEMED TO BE SOME RALLY AND PEOPLE CHEERING LIKE MAD AND HE WAS FULL CRY AND ROARING WITH ENERGY AND COULDN’T GET ENOUGH OF IT TRUMP SEEMS MUCH THE SAME WAY. Tucker: THE DEBATE OVER WHOSE PARTY IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IT’S TRUMP’S PARTY. IT IS. BUT CONSIDER I THINK IT’S ALSO FAIR TO SAY, TUCKER, FOR ALL THE TALK ABOUT HOW THE PARTY HAS BEEN COMPLETELY TAKEN OVER BY TRUMP AND THE AND IT WILL NOT IT WILL BE HIS PARTY IN PERPETUITY, I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND ITS INFLUENCE ON HIM THAN HE HAS HAD ON THEM. Tucker: WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT THE ISSUES, RIGHT? TAXES. HE TALKED ABOUT THAT. THAT’S A CENTRAL REPUBLICAN TENET. STRONGER DEFENSE, ALSO, LIKEWISE A CENTRAL REPUCK REPUBLICAN TENET. DEREGULATION, THAT’S A BEEN A REPUBLICAN RED LETTER ISSUE FOREVER. ONLY ISSUES WHICH HE HAS DEPARTED ARE IMMIGRATION AND TRADE. IT’S NOT AT ALL CLEAR WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE WHETHER WHAT COMES OUT OF ALL OF THIS THE POLICIES THAT EMERGE ARE OBJECTIONABLE TO THE REPUBLICAN MAINSTREAM. Tucker: IF THERE WERE A THIRD PARTY CHALLENGE. WHAT WOULD THE THIRD PARTY CHALLENGER RUN ON EXACTLY. WELL A THIRD PARTY CHALLENGE TO TRUMP OR A CANDIDATE? Tucker: CANDIDATE. IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ON THE ISSUE OF PERSONAL CHARACTER. PEOPLE WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW, WHICH IS THE ISSUE THAT GOT GEORGE W. BUSH ELECTED BUT NOT NECESSARILY WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN RANKS. WHITE HOUSE, OF COURSE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE CLINTON SCANDALS THAT CARRIED WEIGHT AND DAMAGING TO AL GORE WHO HAD TO FIGHT HE HAD TO MAKE THE DECISION HOW CLOSELY TO LINK HIMSELF TO CLINTON AND THE ROBUST ECONOMY AND WAS ARGUED FOREVER THAT HE DIDN’T DO THAT ENOUGH OR HE DID IT TOO MUCH. THAT WAS A BURDEN ON HIM FOR SURE. AND BUSH CAPITALIZED ON IT. WHETHER THAT WILL WORK IN A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY AT THIS STAGE I DON’T THINK SO. I THINK TRUMP HAS TAKEN OVER MOST OF THE REPUBLICAN AGENDA. Tucker: SO ON THE ISSUES, YOU DON’T SEE ANY KIND OF CHALLENGE FOR THE NOMINATION? WELL, PEOPLE. I DON’T THINK ANYONE CAN CHALLENGE HIM FROM THE LEFT ON IMMIGRATION OR PARTICULARLY ON TRADE. ALTHOUGH ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH TRUMP’S TRADE AGENDA IS THAT IT COULD GO WRONG. AND WE COULD END UP, YOU KNOW, WITH TRADE BARRIERS UP. WE HAVE SORT OF BACKED INTO OR, YOU KNOW, SORT OF AND THE ECONOMY COULD GET HURT BY THAT. AND, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HAVE SOMEBODY RUNNING AGAINST HIM ON THE ECONOMY. BUT THE ECONOMY WOULD HAVE TO GO PRETTY FAR SOUTH FROM WHERE IT IS NOW FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. HOW BOOYED DO YOU THINK TRUMP IS REPUBLICANS ARE BY THE POTENTIAL NORTH KOREAN DEAL? WELL, I THINK TRUMP WAS PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT, ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF IT I WILL SAY THIS. MY CONCERN HAS BEEN AND IS NOW THAT HE GETS INTO THE SUMMIT AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A DEAL THAT WOULD DENUCLEARIZE IT AND END THE KOREAN WAR AND THE REST OF IT THAT HE MAKES A BAD DEAL. THAT HE GETS EUCHRED WHICH IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE REPEATEDLY. SO FAR THOUGH, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT DESPITE HIS EXCITED TALK AND HIS BUYING IN AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT TO THE NOBEL PRIZE TALK, HIS WILLINGNESS TO SAY OKAY, THIS IS OFF SUGGESTS TO ME THAT, YOU KNOW, HE HAS HIS EYES WIDE OPEN AND THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM DO, TOO. IF HE GETS OVER THERE OR IF THEY TRY TO ORGANIZE THIS THING AND IT’S COMING TO PUT THAT, THAT HE IS WILLING TO WALK AWAY. BUT IF HE DIDN’T DO THAT. AND HE GOT INTO A BAD DEAL, THAT MIGHT LEAVE VULNERABILITY. YOU POINTING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR REPUBLICANS, FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY CERTAINLY LOOK A LOT BETTER THAN THEY DID SIX MONTHS AGO. Tucker: MUCH BETTER. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF DEMOCRATS FAILED TO RETAKE THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES? WHAT WOULD THE RECKONING BE LIKE DO YOU THINK WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY? IT WOULD BE PRETTY SERIOUS. I THINK THE MESSAGE THAT WOULD PROBABLY COME OUT OF THAT WOULD BE THAT BEING, YOU KNOW, JUST OVERWHELMINGLY ANTI-TRUMP IS NOT ENOUGH. THAT WHILE THAT AWAKENS THE SENTIMENTS IN THE BASE AND RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF THE ENERGY IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THESE DAYS, THAT THAT IN ITSELF IS NOT ENOUGH. IT’S TOO NEGATIVE. DOESN’T PAINT A PICTURE OF HOW MUCH BETTER THINGS COULD BE. IT DOESN’T REALLY AROUSE PEOPLE MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT PASSIONATE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. MOST PEOPLE WILLING TO VOTE ON A MIDTERM WANT TO HEAR FROM SOMEBODY WHO SAYS, LOOK, I CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR YOU AND HERE IS HOW. AND IF YOU HAVEN’T GOT THAT IN A WAY THAT AND IF YOU RUN AS A DEMOCRAT, SOME DEMOCRATS SEEM PREPARED TO DO IT. VOTE FOR ME, I WILL RAISE YOUR TAXES. THAT’S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WORK EITHER. Tucker: DO YOU SEE ANY STIRRINGS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH IS REALIGNS AGO I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THOUGH IT GETS LITTLE COVERAGE. ANY STIRRINGS OF A POSITIVE AGENDA. WE ARE AGAINST TRUMP OF COURSE WE ARE BUT HERE IS WHAT WE ARE FOVMENT DO YOU SEE ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES. GROW. I’M NOT SURE HOW WE WOULD KNOW. THE TRUTH IS WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO IT, TUCKER, THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF NEW IDEAS. YOU ARE USUALLY FOR REIGNING IN GOVERNMENT. CONTROLLING SPENDING ALTHOUGH REPUBLICANS HAVE KIND OF GIVEN UP ON THAT. AND AT LEAST IN RECENT TIMES. LOWER TAXES. STERNER DEFENSE. TOUGHER FOREIGN POLICY. ALL OF THAT RIGHT? SOFT REGULATION. DEMOCRATS ARE FOR THE OPPOSITE THINGS. AND THEY ALWAYS WILL BE. THAT’S WHAT THEY ARE ABOUT. YOU KNOW, SO YOU CAN RUN ON A PLATFORM THAT SAYS LOOK, YOU KNOW, TRUMP IS DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT. IS HE LETTING THE CORPORATE MOGULS RUN AMUCK AND BIG BANKS ARE CASHING IN AS NEVER BEFORE. WE HAVE GOT TO PUT A STOP TO THIS. THAT WILL ATTRACT SOME SUPPORT. THAT SEEMS PRETTY TIRED RIGHT NOW.
