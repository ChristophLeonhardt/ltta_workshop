the Democrats are in full-scale panic and they should be Hillary Clinton has been dropping like a stone in the polls weeks ago she was up well over seven points in the Real Clear Politics poll average she's now down to a 2.8 percent lead in a four-way race in the state polls Trump has been gaining steadily to the point where axiom strategies now has Trump down just one point in Colorado and two in Pennsylvania and up four in Florida for Nevada to a North Carolina five in Ohio if that's anywhere close to right this election is now on a knife's edge and all of it is HIGHlarious every accusation Democrats made about Trump during this election cycle is now blowing up in their faces and Democrats are running around like Joe Biden drunk with shotgun endangering themselves and others here are five reasons this news cycle is the greatest news cycle actually in human history first Hillary has now told the FBI to come clean yes really she told the FBI to come clean Hillary has now said the FBI should reveal what it knows about Anthony Weiner's emails they have to come clean to demonstrate to the American public there is there's either something there or there isn't it turns out that there is someone else who knows whether there's something there or not lady named Hillary Clinton may have heard of her her pathological need to hide information led to this entire bizarre scenario she set up the private server she hid the existence she deleted thousands of emails and now she wants the FBI to come clean this is the equivalent of the Menendez brothers killing their parents and then falling on the mercy of the court because they're orphans Anthony Weiner second thing about this victim a is and yes Anthony Weiner Hillary spends her entire political career worrying about rogue Weiner only to be laid low by rogue Weiner bill clinton officiated weiners wedding to hillary aide Huma Abedin who's been paid by literally every Clinton associated group in history today oh the Clinton Foundation the State Department now weiners unfortunate tendency to explode and send pictures of his junk to random females allegedly including underage females has come back to bite Hillary Clinton after Houma already decided to publicly dump him oh the hilarity and if you don't think that's funny you should just watch Joe Biden's reaction to weiners involvement the moment will show it's pretty amazing third Democrats hate James Comey all of a sudden the New York Daily News accused FBI director Comey of being a bomber really New York Times columnist Charles blow who does blow essentially stated that Comey had rigged the election on behalf of Donald Trump after months of complaining that Trump undermined democracy itself by calling into question the decency of American institutions like the FBI and saying that Republican attacks on Comey specifically undercut the country's best interests now the Democrats want to take Comey out and pound on him with a shovel in Iowa like Joe Pesci at the end of Casino fourth democratic spokespeople on Comey are seriously the worst people in the world so who are the Democrats trotting out to yell at Comey well they've decided to unleash former AG Eric Holder the most corrupt Attorney General in American history a dude under contempt of Congress who facilitated gun running and fast and furious and lied about it who oversaw the transition of the DOJ into into a racial grievance squad who used the DOJ to target journalists like James Rosen who labeled Fort Hood workplace violence he's their go-to guy criticizing James Comey on ethics and then there's Senator Harry Reid a sociopathic liar who once said that MIT Romney paid no taxes without any evidence and then said that was fine just so long as Romney lost now Reid is accusing Comey of violating the Hatch Act he hasn't and stating that Comey is covering up trumps relationship with Russia with no evidence and the media naturally are taking it seriously because of course they are finally President Obama is now openly campaigning for someone under three FBI investigations Hillary's private server remains under investigation Anthony Weiner's device his other device is now under investigation and the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Foundation is under investigation too Barack Obama is going around telling Americans Hillary is the most qualified president ever yes for prison this is the best it's hilarious should Comey have dropped this bombshell well he had no other choice after killing the private server investigation for political reasons back in July if he'd waited two weeks to drop this information people would rightly have said that he stopped the investigation back in July for Hillary and started up again after her election well now Hillary's got troubles and it sure is sweet i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show all righty okay so here we are happy Halloween to everyone and we love you okay so first have to start so

things that you need to know about this scandal because it's it's know it feels like tsunami I mean it's like drinking from a firehose so you know last Friday we we started the show right as this was breaking so now we know a little bit more but here let's break it down into kind of discrete parts at first the new emails were uncovered by the FBI in the Weiner probe and I just I love the fact that we use the phrase Weiner probe in in political parlance now it's kind of awesome so anthony weiner's penis troubles have become kind of well known at this point he has a habit of sending his pictures of his penis to every female within a 3,000 mile radius of any age and and i have to acknowledge that the FBI agent who is tasked with the responsibility for looking at these emails has the unluckiest job in the world because basically is going through the emails and it's like penis penis penis classified information penis penis yoga email wedding email penis I mean that's a really crappy job the FBI was investigating weiners magic devices and found emails related to Clinton investigations that's first thing you need to know second the Weiner device yes the Weiner device has 650 thousand emails on it according to The Wall Street Journal and they say the metadata suggests thousands of those messages could have been sent to or from Hilary Clinton's private server third FBI director Comey's letter didn't really say much we pointed this out last week there wasn't a lot there in the letter it basically just said we found some new information and I'm letting you know about it he has sent a letter by now to all of the FBI employees and it says quote because those emails appear to be pertinent to our investigation I agreed we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review them of course we don't ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was complete hey fourth this is amazing FBI agents knew for weeks that these emails were on the Weiner server and now he I mean Weiner has a private server a server for money do what he wants it to do but the FBI agents they say that they have found they found these emails weeks ago and they only let Co me know about it on Thursday so Comey didn't want to look hidden want to be a perjurer so he immediately let Congress know and then it went public v Huma Abedin has already testified under oath to give up any device with any Hillary Clinton email on it so that's not true right so that's not true and that's going to come back to bite her obviously 6th the DOJ and this really is amazing according to The Wall Street Journal the FBI was investigating the Clinton Foundation and Loretta Lynch or as Andrew Cleveland likes to call her the blandly sinister Attorney General tried to shut it down now lest we forget Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton on the tarmac at an Arizona Airport just before James Comey decided not to push for indictment on Hillary's private server here's what the Journal says quote the Justice Department was Stern icy dismissive of the Clinton Foundation case anti-corruption prosecutors at the Justice Department told the FBI at the meeting they would not authorize more aggressive investigative techniques such as subpoenas formal witness interviews or grand jury testimony deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe was the guy responsible for shutting down the investigation under severe pressure from the DOJ and finally Democrats are absolutely losing their minds and that's the theme of today's show so I thought last Friday I said that this week would be nuts because you would see the Democrats Trump every piece of terrible oppo on Trump they had if they had if they had a tape a sex tape of Trump with a horse they would use it right this would be the time to do it they apparently don't because they're panicking I mean that's the dead giveaway is that they are running around with their hair on fire they are losing their minds it's it's it's like Rosie O'Donnell after a three based a three-day starvation diet I mean they have lost whatever tenuous connection they had to reality and it's over for them they don't have anything else so they just have to wait this sucker out and hope that everything goes okay that's essentially what they what they that's it right I mean they have to wait the sucker out and hope that they have enough of a lead that it's enough going into election day now as I say the polls have been tightening they were tightening even before this revelation Hillary was down to like three points in the national lead and was very tight in a lot of states as it's enough to put Trump over at the top unlikely but it depends how his week goes because there's still enough of a gap in most of these states and enough red states in play or purple states in play for Hillary that she still has a pretty sizable advantage that's why the oddsmakers still say that he has about a three to one advantage on him in terms of winning the presidency but she's handling this about as badly as you can handle this so Hillary Clinton this this news breaks last Friday and then Hillary Clinton does a presser and here's what she had to say at her press conference so the American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately the director himself has said he doesn't know whether the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not I'm confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July therefore it's imperative that the Bureau explained this issue in question whatever it is without any delay it's the best okay so now we got Hillary Clinton telling the FBI you need to release my emails lady I know someone else who had access to your emails I'm looking at her unfortunately like she's right there she's wearing blue I have a hint she's wearing also a necklace that appears to be made of dragons eggs from Game of Thrones but Hillary Clinton you know like really you're saying the FBI they need to release what they've got if you had just released what you had none of this would be an issue in the first place then Hillary goes on and she starts lying so here's Hillary lying about how the FBI is politicized basically no we have not been contacted by anyone first we knew about it is I assume when you knew about it when this letter sent to Republican members of the House was released so we don't know the facts which is why we are calling on the FBI to release all the information that it has even director Comey noted that this new information may not be significant so let's get it out okay so she's she's obviously desperate at this point when she says only Republicans received the letter by the way she said that at one point during this press conference that's just it's not true I mean Democrats got the letter - so that's all imploding Hillary sends out one of her campaign representatives to cut an online video and this is the weakest routine I have seen in a very long time a director James Comey released to Congress an unbelievably vague letter that was light on facts and heavy on innuendo and it only serves to give Republicans a new line of attack against Hillary Clinton but the more information that has come out the more overblown this all seems and the more concern it has created about director Comey's actions let's walk through what we know Republicans said at the beginning of this that the FBI case that was closed in July had been reopened but that's been debunked and law enforcement sources say that the emails in question were never withheld by Hillary Clinton or the Clinton campaign reports say that the emails were not - or from Hillary Clinton or even ever on her server in fact it's entirely possible that they are all duplicates of emails the FBI already looked at months ago so if that's the case why send this letter in the first place you're probably just as puzzled and outraged as we are former Justice Department Center this year so we've got block emic block of wood telling us that there's nothing to see here the real reason as I said last week that James Comey did this is because he got the notice that these emails were there he was afraid that if he waited for three weeks to announce it it would look like he shut down the investigation in July held it off until Hillary was elected and then released all of the emails after she was already the president-elect so you let it go now and the Hillary people are just fighting mad about this they're very very upset meanwhile Donald Trump is on cloud nine and with his usual sort of subtlety he goes forward and he thanks Anthony Weiner we never thought we were going to say thank you to Anthony Weiner okay we never thought okay first of all Thank You Weiner is also Trump's secondary campaign slogan but but I love the fact that he said he's right by the way he of course he should be thanking Anthony Weiner is kind of amazing but the most amazing video of the day actually is Joe Biden's here's Joe Biden's reaction when he finds out that all of these emails were found on Anthony Weiner's private device well Oh God Oh Anthony Weiner I should not come in and Auntie Weiner I'm not a big fan and I wasn't before he got in trouble so I shouldn't come in Anthony Weiner I love that I like I like when he starts lecturing himself I shouldn't comment on this but I'm gonna comment on like he has no filter between his brain in his mouth and you can see they're all going nuts even Obama is going nuts oh it just came out right before the show we have time to cut this but Josh earnest over at the White House he has now come out and he has said that the White House doesn't really have any criticism for James Comey so they're throwing Hillary right under the bus they figure she's got enough of a lead she'll survive but it's bad news for Hillary people are abandoning her on all sides of her now Democrats stick with her and there's a point I'm going to talk about a little bit later in the program the Democrats no matter what stick with their woman no matter how corrupt she is now that's either a good thing for you or a bad thing for you I understand the argument it's a good thing because Democrats are unified Republicans haven't been on the other hand it just demonstrates the Democrats have no values and Republicans actually do so that's worth noting here but the media have been trying to they've been trying struggling for a way to let Hillary off the hook and they're having a tough time doing it because the truth is that the Clinton people just don't have any answer so John Podesta was on with I think it's with Chris Wallace and and he says no Huma Abedin it wasn't to choose hiding emails if she tried to comply she did her very much telling Jake Tapper have you asked Abidine why she did not turn over this computer that is now being reviewed by the FBI look I think whom has been completely cooperative with the authorities and and they've recognized that she's worked with her attorneys to turn over relevant Tyrael uh but we don't know what this is all about really so it's it's very hard John she hasn't been completely cooperative if she didn't turn over every device that had State Department ideals on this one later I think it's clear that she she uh uh complied to the best variability turn everything over that she had in her possession I don't know anything more than the speculation that's running a wild in in the press now about what this is about I've talked to her you tosser have you asked have you asked Huma Abedin what is on the computer and why she didn't turn it over when she said you know what mr. Comey is talking about you're assuming a lot of facts that we don't know okay John Podesta is so confused and angry at this point that his head is actually shrinking into two dimensionality it's pretty amazing so they they have no good answers on this so we take a break really quick and say hello to our sponsors over at naturebox calm and I'm one of the people who eats a lot of crap at the office and so does everybody else here it's why we're all fat so naturebox calm as the solution to all of that because naturebox.com/tyler the 100 delicious snacks to choose from they've healthy they've indulgent with artificial it look at this box and this is good stuff over here so we've got the crispy snickerdoodles which obviously I mean come on and we've got Gary fruit peels this all this all looks like solid stuff we're gonna have a tasting a little bit later this week on the podcast with all the with the members of The Daily wire crew including Taylor who is joining us a little bit earlier and yes the tattoos are real but naturebox Commons the place you go if you want to pick these great snacks and they are they are very affordable and they are healthy and they have terrific variety so that doesn't take that long to get to you it comes pretty quickly and they relaunch new snacks like every 12 weeks so right now you get two free snacks when you go to nature box combats nature box calm for free and people in the office have already tried them and they say that they're really fantastic so nature box calm you want to see more John Podesta struggling around like a like a guy blundering into I mean he's like he's sort of like a character in an old at this point an old horror novel or blunders into the mores and there's and there's some sort of monster in the Moors that's going to eat him here it is with Jake Tapper and you're gonna watch him blunder right into an abyss in the Moors but it's not that they haven't read any of them obviously the FBI agents who stumbled upon them read some of them and determined them to be too I realized they didn't have do you know that that's accordingly that really it's according to I just tell me though according to the reporting of Evan Perez our Justice Department correspond and it's not as though they didn't know anything in the emails they stumbled upon them found that they seem to be pertinent to the Clinton email server investigation and that is why seems that you might not be significant eleven days before the election is that something you toss on the table or do you take the time to do what other prosecutors have done in the past and make sure that if it that it is so significant that you had to go forward with it so I don't fault him for taking a look at whatever he's found we don't really know what that is but at this stage having taken this step then he at least ought to explain uh you know if he if he thinks they're significant or not significant let's let him come forward and say why John Podesta is voice rising into dog ranges he realizes there's no way to explain away why it is that Hillary Clinton hit all these emails me now is James commis fault that he's not revealing all of the emails before he's had a chance to review all of them well unfortunately we have to say goodbye to all of our folks over at facebook.com as well as YouTube but if you go over to Daley wire.com become a subscriber then you can join all of the fun we have more Halloween fun plan a little bit later here daily wire.com and eight bucks a month you get a free copy of my new book which comes out in print tomorrow true allegiance and and I will sign it for you as well so make sure that you head over to Daley wire.com and join the most popular conservative podcast in America you
