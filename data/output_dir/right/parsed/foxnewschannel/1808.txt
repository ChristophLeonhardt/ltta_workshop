WITH TECHNOLOGY OUR DIAMOND &
SILK SOCIAL MEDIA STARS AND
TRUMP SUPPORTERS DIAMOND & SILK

PETE: GREAT SALUTE TO MOMS
EVERYWHERE.
ED: SO THERE IS THIS GUY TOM STY
RE, HE'S A LIBERAL YOU KNOW
HIM FOR PUSHING ADS ABOUT GLOBAL
WARMING AND HORRIFIC THINGS ARE
HAPPENING AND HE WANTS TO
IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND NOW
HE HAS THIS AD THAT WE WANT YOU
TO REACT TO REACHING OUT TO MOMS
ON MOTHER'S DAY SAYING, YOU KNOW
, GO AFTER YOUR KIDS WHO
MIGHT BE CONSERVATIVE SUPPORTING
TRUMP, WATCH.
>>  I STARTED NOTICING SOME
ISSUES WITH HIM MAYBE IN MIDDLE
SCHOOL.
HE WAS NEVER AFRAID TO TALK WITH
GIRLS, BUT THINGS NEVER REALLY
WORKED OUT FOR SOME REASON.
I'M WORRIED WHEN HE WENT TO
COLLEGE BUT HE CAME HOME OFTEN,
I GUESS HE NEVER REALLY LEARNED
TO DO HIS OWN LAUNDRY.
IT WASN'T UNTIL I MET HIS
COLLEGE BUDDIES THAT I REALIZED
THAT IT MIGHT BE TOO LATE.
THIS MOTHER'S DAY, TALK TO YOUR
CHILD ABOUT THE GOP.
ED: SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
ABOUT THAT?
>>  WELL YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDS
LIKE WHAT'S WRONG WITH THESE
DEMOCRATS IS THEY'RE TRYING TO
RECREATE THEIR HISTORY OR HIDE
THEIR HISTORY BUT WE ALL KNOW
THE REAL HISTORY ABOUT THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HOW THEY WERE
THE PARTY OF THE KKK, THAT
CREATED THINGS AND THE PARTY
THAT'S NOW BEEN FIGHTING OUR
COUNTRY AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT
IT'S TIME TIME TO VOTE THESE
DEMOCRATS OUT THIS IS THE PARTY
DOING HATRED IN OUR COUNTRY AND
THAT WE DON'T NEED RUNNING
ANYTHING AROUND.
>>  IT'S REALLY FUNNY THE
DEMOCRAT IS ALL FOR GUN CONTROL
BUT OKAY WITH KILLING BABIES.
PETE: WELL THINK ABOUT THE
IMPLICATION IF YOU SUPPORT THE
GOP YOU MUST BE MARCHING IN
CHARLOTTESVILLE WITH TIKI
TORCHES AND YOU'RE A WHITE
SUPREMACIST.
FROM?
>>  LISTEN THE GOP IS THE PARTY
OF FREEDOM OKAY?
FREEDOM, FREE TO THINK FOR
YOURSELF AND TO DO WHATEVER YOU
WANT TO DO . THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS
THEY WANT TO CONTROL YOU AND
HAVE YOU IN A MINDSET, BUT IT'S
NOT GOING TO WORK AND ALL
AMERICANS NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT
WHOSE TRYING TO REPRESENT THEIR
COUNTRY.
THIS PARTY RIGHT HERE IS --
ABBY: SPEAKING ABOUT DEMOCRATS
AND SOMEONE THAT STILL WANTS TO
REPRESENT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
HILLARY CLINTON WHO DID HER BOOK
TOUR HERE IN THE UNITED STATES
NOW SHE'S GONNABROAD, RECENTLY
IN AUSTRALIA AND MELBOURNE HAD A
LOT TO SAY ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP
AND THE IRAN DEAL BUT AT ONE
POINT SHE TALKED ABOUT WOMEN AND
HOW AMERICANS FEEL UNEASY ABOUT
WOMEN PARTICULARLY IN LEADERSHIP
POSITIONS.
LISTEN TO THIS.
>>  THERE IS STILL A VERY LARGE
PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION
THAT IS UNEASY WITH WOMEN IN
POSITIONS OF LEADERSHIP, AND SO
THE EASIEST WAY TO KIND OF AVOID
HAVING TO LOOK AT SOMEONE ON HER
MERITS IS TO DISMISS HER ON HER
LOOKS.
ABBY: REACTION TO THAT LADIES?
>>  WELL YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT
UNEASY ABOUT WOMEN.
WE WERE UNEASY ABOUT HER ABUSING
HER POWER AND WE UNDERSTAND SHE
MAY HAVE HAD IT ON HER BUCKET
LIST TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, BUT
GUESS WHAT?
THOSE BUCKETS WERE FULL OF SAND
AND EMPTY PROMISE AND THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THAT SO
LISTEN SHE DON'T GET TO PLAY
MUSICAL CHAIRS WITH THE
PRESIDENCY.
WE'VE ALREADY HAD A CLINTON IN
OFFICE, IT'S TIME FOR HER TO GO
DRINK A GLASS OF CHARDONAY AND
SIT DOWN TO WHERE SHE'S NOT
RUNNING ANYTHING.
>>  OR STAY IN THE WOODS.
ABBY: WOW THERE IS SOME TOUGH
WORDS.
PETE: YOU KNOW, A MOTHER'S DAY
MESSAGE YOU MIGHT SAY ON THIS
MOTHER'S DAY I THINK EVERY
MOTHER YOU WOULD AGREE SHOULD
HAVE A GLASS OF CHARDONAY THIS
MORNING, RIGHT?
>>  YES, A GLASS OF GOOD OLD
CHARDONAY, ESPECIALLY HILLARY
CLINTON.
ABBY: DIAMOND & SILK GOOD TO SEE
YOU.
PETE: APPRECIATE YOU.
>>  WE LOVE YOU.
ABBY: I'D LOVE TO MEET THEIR MOM
