I don't want to give the party thing because misleading I ever I never vote so that's the truth look I didn't vote this time I never do vote then you don't have a right to give your opinion I do and in fact I do and I'm registered actually with the party that I sincerely despise because I think it's really a force for bad in this country and it's a democratic party but I'm registered because I live in the district it's a one-party state and the one election I always vote in as the mayor's race because it matters and I own property there I raise four children there I live in the city and I think it's worth voting in that election so I always do I always vote for the more corrupt candidate over the idealist always the person who will just like be happy taking payoffs from developers and leave me alone it's always the kid it's like a meaningful decision in my life and it's every four years there's always some guy who's like I'm gonna make your life better I vote against that person every single time you know what I mean and it's usually some honestly it's you just it's it's some progressive candidate who's got big plans for me and so I just vote for the for the status quo corrupt criminal operation that runs the city and I'm really happy with that well Tucker that's great I have a hundred more questions but we're out of time and I've got a hundred more it's good thank you thank you you
