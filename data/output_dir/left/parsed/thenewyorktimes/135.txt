With Andres Manuel
López Obrador’s victory,
Mexico has elected
a new president
willing to push back
against Donald Trump.
López Obrador has
shown a willingness
to go toe to toe with Trump,
who often taunts Mexico.
He’s been sharply critical
of the border wall.
And of Nafta.
López Obrador has been
compared to Nicolas Maduro
for being a populist on the left.
And with Donald Trump
for his protectionist
and anti-establishment
approach.
But he insists
he’s his own man.
