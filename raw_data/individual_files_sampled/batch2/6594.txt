Chuck Todd is reacting to Republican praise of Donald Trump right after the tax cut bill he's a little surprised by it I'm amused by his reaction I don't wanna beat him up too much over it I'm glad that he recognizes the Trump's problems but anyway let's watch it and then I'll tell you what I've we're a week removed from the president dividing the party disgustingly in half at times over Roy Moore and yet the words that were used to describe the president today by that his fellow Republicans extraordinary exquisite a miracle one heck of a leader makes this presidency great the greatest in generations or in a navy ever I think I did not hear broad shoulder today my personal favorite um Mitch McConnell extraordinary accomplishment for the Trump administration exquisite presidential leadership wow I was I am surprised at how much they all they didn't just hug the president they went all in yeah so look bless is hard for pointing out what those problems have said and putting them on the record so overall good segment but I guess I'm surprised at his surprise and that's what frustrates me about a lot of the television coverage the Republicans don't have principles just let it go let it go and by the way it's not a partisan thing a lot of the most of the Democrats who take donor money also don't have principles so I know you guys think they're having a debate they're not having a debate bob Corker said that he changed his mind on the tax bill after taking a long walk maybe I'm taking a long check but not a long walk so the fact that they give these guys credence is what surprises and amuses me after all of these years Chuck they're gonna do what their donors say 100% of the time and it is by the way it's not just my speculation and it's the Princeton and Northwestern did a study they studied 1,800 policy positions over 20 years and this was even before Citizens United it was after money started entering politics in 1976 and 1978 Supreme Court decisions Buckley v Valeo in' and Bilotti after that corporations poured money into politicians through campaign contributions eventually independent expenditures and all the different ways that they got them this money and then the politicians did what they were told to do by the people who wrote them their checks I know that that continues to be a shock to people on TV but everyone else in the country gets it 93% of Americans say that politicians thought partisan politicians serve their donors not their voters but so I am not at all surprised that the Republicans ever go go Justice Roy Moore thing I might play well in Alabama but you know I might lose a couple of votes in Illinois or wherever I am so I'm gonna say no to that now turn around go yes the historic wonderful Donald Trump why because this was their number one priority was their donors number-one priority they were going to kiss the Ahnold Trump's ass on this no matter what I mean if they were gonna have moral qualms with Donald Trump wouldn't they have already had them you're really surprised that they have no principles or no ethics that's amazing to me by the way the other part of this that's important is that the Republican base hasn't really moved they had the same issues in Alabama they peeled away dojos peeled away a tiny percentage of the Republicans and it was enough for him to win by a point and a half but look at the numbers here Alabama Republicans voted for more ninety one to nine percent he's forgot ninety-one percent of the vote let alone the fact that he's an insane conspiracy theorist who now thinks the Muslims might have stolen the election in Alabama what and he's a child molester and he's all those things and he still got 91 percent of the Republican vote so those senators think well my base is a bunch of knuckleheads they'll vote for me no matter what especially if Trump's on my side and and and I'm not a child molester so I you know I'm gonna win easy okay and and and my donors are gonna be thrilled so please look is a good segment it's good to point out that the that the Republicans are completely hugging completely on the side of Donald Trump but that that's been clear all along because this is the one place where they're all lined up both Trump and those Republican senators serve their donors you have private financing of Elections they work for private interests I hope you like that clip of The Young Turks if you did I got great news for you we got a whole show online for you guys you can get it by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
