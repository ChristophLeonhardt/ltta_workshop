1
00:00:05,358 --> 00:00:07,259
JESSE: THE LIBERAL MEDIA MELTING

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,928
DOWN OVER KANYE'S MEETING WITH

3
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,864
THE PRESIDENT ON THURSDAY.

4
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:14,266
HERE IS SOME OF WHAT KANYE HAD

5
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:15,200
TO SAY.

6
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:17,870
>> WHEN I PUT THE HAT ON IT MADE

7
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:20,239
ME FEEL LIKE SUPERMAN.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,941
THE LIBERALS ARE TRYING TO

9
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:24,777
CONTROL BLACK PEOPLE BECAUSE

10
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:27,312
THEY KNOW WE ARE EMOTIONAL

11
00:00:27,313 --> 00:00:28,047
PEOPLE.

12
00:00:28,048 --> 00:00:30,115
ILLEGAL GUNS ARE THE PROBLEM.

13
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:31,316
NOT LEGAL GUNS.

14
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:33,085
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.

15
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:34,853
HE WANTS TO BRING JOBS INTO

16
00:00:34,854 --> 00:00:35,654
AMERICA.

17
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:37,923
OUR BEST EXPORT IS ENTERTAINMENT

18
00:00:37,924 --> 00:00:38,791
AND IDEAS.

19
00:00:38,792 --> 00:00:41,360
BUT WHEN WE MAKE EVERYTHING IN

20
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:43,328
CHINA AND NOT AMERICA, WE ARE

21
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:46,031
CHEATING ON OUR COUNTRY.

22
00:00:46,032 --> 00:00:48,967
JESSE: THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAS

23
00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:51,370
BEEN HITTING ON KANYE EVER SINCE

24
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:55,340
HE CAME OUT AS A TRUMP

25
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:55,707
SUPPORTER.

26
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:59,711
>> KANYE IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

27
00:00:59,712 --> 00:01:00,746
NEGROES DON'T READ.

28
00:01:00,747 --> 00:01:04,083
WE HAVE THIS NOW AND DONALD

29
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:06,585
TRUMP WILL USE IT AND PERVERT IT

30
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:10,456
AND HE'LL HAVE SOMEBODY TO TAKE

31
00:01:10,457 --> 00:01:12,024
PICTURES WITH.

32
00:01:12,025 --> 00:01:15,661
HE'S AN ATTENTION WHORE LIKE THE

33
00:01:15,662 --> 00:01:16,462
PRESIDENT.

34
00:01:16,463 --> 00:01:19,364
HE'S THE TOKEN NEGRO OF THE

35
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:20,466
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

36
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:21,900
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

37
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:26,004
NOBODY SHOULD BE TAKING KANYE

38
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:27,773
WEST SERIOUSLY.

39
00:01:27,774 --> 00:01:33,679
JESSE: WOW, HERE REACT, ROB,

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,848
DOES IT OFFEND YOU?

41
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:39,017
>> LOOKING AT THAT CLIP, I WOULD

42
00:01:39,018 --> 00:01:42,688
SAY DON LEMON WENT FROM AN

43
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:47,459
ANCHOR AT CNN TO THE CHIEF

44
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,661
OVERSEER ON THE CLINTON

45
00:01:49,662 --> 00:01:50,696
FOUNDATION.

46
00:01:50,697 --> 00:01:51,997
IT'S DISGUSTING TO ME.

47
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:53,432
WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IS

48
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:55,968
SEND A MESSAGE TO ANY OTHER

49
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:57,169
BLACK AMERICAN OR BLACK

50
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,871
CONSERVATIVE THAT SUPPORTS THE

51
00:01:58,872 --> 00:02:00,005
PRESIDENT, THIS IS WHAT WE'LL DO

52
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:02,241
TO YOU IF YOU ARE VOCAL ABOUT

53
00:02:02,242 --> 00:02:02,941
THAT SUPPORT.

54
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:06,712
JESSE: WENDY, WHAT DO YOU THINK

55
00:02:06,713 --> 00:02:07,980
ABOUT THAT?

56
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:09,915
>> MY PROBLEM IS THAT HE WAS

57
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,483
GIVEN THE ABILITY TO GO TO THE

58
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:14,653
OVAL OFFICE AND HE BASICALLY

59
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:16,255
PERFORMED IN IGNORANCE.

60
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:18,223
WHEN HE WENT THERE HE COULD HAVE

61
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:20,159
TALKED TO DONALD TRUMP ABOUT

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,661
WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHICAGO, HE

63
00:02:22,662 --> 00:02:25,898
COULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT STOP AND

64
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:27,966
FRISK AND HE COULD HAVE ASKED

65
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:31,370
DONALD TRUMP WHY HE CUT

66
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:33,172
HEALTHCARE AND EDUCATION.

67
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:35,707
>> I COMPLETELY DISAGREE.

68
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,709
>> IT'S FINE FOR YOU TO

69
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,076
DISAGREE.

70
00:02:38,077 --> 00:02:39,578
I THINK THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY,

71
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:42,447
THE GOP HAS TO DECIDE WHEN IS IT

72
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:44,650
OKAY FOR BLACK ATHLETES AND

73
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:46,251
PERFORMERS TO SHUPT AND DRIBBLE

74
00:02:46,252 --> 00:02:48,554
OR BECOME THE BEACON OF HOPE FOR

75
00:02:48,555 --> 00:02:49,388
YOUR PARTY.

76
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:51,456
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

77
00:02:51,457 --> 00:02:54,293
JESSE: HE DID BRING UP STOP AND

78
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:54,760
FRISK.

79
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:58,931
HE SAID HE DOESN'T LIKE TO AND

80
00:02:58,932 --> 00:03:00,832
FRISK AND TOLD THE PRESIDENT TO

81
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,567
KNOCK IT OUT.

82
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:04,703
>> FOR YOU TO CALL IT A MINSTREL

83
00:03:04,704 --> 00:03:07,839
SHOW YOU ARE DOING WHAT EVERY

84
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,410
OTHER BLACK PERSON IS DOING.

85
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:13,245
KANYE WEST TALKED ABOUT THE

86
00:03:13,246 --> 00:03:13,979
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BLACK

87
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,881
PEOPLE AND THE POLICE.

88
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:17,883
HE TALKED ABOUT SUPPORTING THE

89
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:19,685
PRESIDENT AND MAKING AMERICA

90
00:03:19,686 --> 00:03:20,052
GREAT.

91
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:23,822
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE FOUL

92
00:03:23,823 --> 00:03:25,390
LANGUAGE WHEN YOU ARE IN THE

93
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:27,593
OVAL OFFICE.

94
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:30,195
YOU SHOULD NOT BANG ON THE TABLE

95
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:33,198
IN THE OVAL OFFICE.

96
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:33,899
JESSE: PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON

97
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,436
DID SOME PRETTY INDECENT THINGS

98
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:38,370
IN THE OVAL OFFICE.

99
00:03:38,371 --> 00:03:41,773
>> THERE WASN'T ALL THIS OUTCRY

100
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:43,609
WHEN RICK ROSS WAS IN THE OVAL

101
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,844
OFFICE AND HIS ANKLE BRACELET

102
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:47,946
WENT OFF.

103
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:51,917
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU, DO YOU

104
00:03:51,918 --> 00:03:53,986
WANT BLACK ATHLETES AND

105
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:55,721
ENTERTAINERS TO SHUT UP AND

106
00:03:55,722 --> 00:03:58,090
DRIBBLE OR BECOME YOUR NEW

107
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:58,590
MASCOT.

108
00:03:58,591 --> 00:04:01,693
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE

109
00:04:01,694 --> 00:04:03,161
SHUTTING UP AND DRIBBLE.

110
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:04,730
IT'S ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE HAVING A

111
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:05,864
SEAT AT THE TABLE.

112
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:08,000
YOU WANT TO MAKE IT SO

113
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:09,601
CONTROVERSIAL FOR ANY BLACK

114
00:04:09,602 --> 00:04:11,103
PERSON TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

115
00:04:11,104 --> 00:04:13,605
WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION.

116
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:15,674
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

117
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:18,343
ONLY 8% OF BLACK PEOPLE VOTED

118
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:20,078
FOR TRUMP.

119
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,080
YOU CAN VOTE FOR TRUMP IF YOU

120
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:24,216
WANT TO.

121
00:04:24,217 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT YOU SHOULD NOT VOTE FOR
