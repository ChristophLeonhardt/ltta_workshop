the solution this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I am Hashem hal Bala it's a revolution against the man who led the revolution in Nicaragua 39 years ago Daniel Ortega and his army of sandanista rebels were victorious in deposing president Anastasio Somoza the left-wing rebel fighters called him a dictator which is exactly what many are calling Ortega now the three-time presidents defied almost four months of protests against his rule at least 300 protesters killed thousands injured and condemnations from all over the world from both friends and foes many are living in fear as gamma roam the streets including in former rebel stronghold Mariana Sanchez reports from more nimble thirty-year-old I began Antonio Hernandez had disappeared for three days but on Friday his family

outside the house but since those are attack going on we couldn't go out since security and pro-government forces launched a so-called clean-up operation in Messiah on Tuesday to lift barricades a caravan of heavily armed and masked gunmen have taken control of morning Bois driving around in vehicles without license plates many businesses and homes here are still closed but the roadblocks have been lifted there are still some tensions here in the neighborhood of morning Bois as a paramilitary continued to patrol these streets food vendor oana popa dough says she's out selling stew for the first time in more than two months but she's still afraid because of the situation we can't talk we can't say anything but we are ok because we are back to work messiahs police say the cleanup operation was ordered by President Daniel Ortega and his wife vice-president Rosario Maria Ortega says the government confronted protesters to bring back stability after weeks of turmoil it has been our duty once again to defend peace for everyone it's been a painful battle because we've confronted an armed conspiracy violent protests in Nicaragua have left nearly 300 people dead morning Bois was a bastion of rebel resistance since the Sandinista revolution 39 years ago and also during these months of protests on Tuesdays confrontations at least two people were killed but the crackdown is not yet over Mariana Sanchez al Jazeera one in BO Nicaragua they send in Eastern a tional Liberation Front or FSLN rose to power in 1979 by overthrowing President Anastasio Somoza anding more than 40 years of his family's war in 1980 the FSLN Revolutionary Government led by Daniel Ortega introduced widespread land reforms to benefit formerly landless peasants two years later right-wing rebels called the Contras who were backed by the United States of America began attacks and a state of emergency was declared the Contra war led to the deaths of more than 30,000 people in 1984 the first free and fair elections were held with a landslide victory for the FSLN but in 1990 the Sandinistas were defeated the new president elected was violated Chamorro was support from Washington the United States immediately stopped backing for the Contras fast forward to 2014 when changes to nicaragua's constitution came into effect allowing President Ortega to run for a third consecutive term he won the election in 2016 and appointed his wife rosario maria as his vice president let's introduce our panel in washington d.c Vanessa joy Minh the founder and CEO of asymetric a consultancy that specializes in Latin America in Manchester UK Colin Harding director of the firm Latin form and via Skype from Managua Alan Blandon a student demonstrator in Nicaragua welcome to you all Vanessa are we talking here about an outcry against the dictator or is it something else oh yeah thank you for having me on yes no it absolutely is an outcry against the dictator I'm originally from Venezuela and I have been on your show several times to discuss those dynamics what we're seeing here is very similar you're seeing that there was a group that sort of couched itself in this left-wing revolutionary you know rhetoric that had at one point some reason for being right there the the agrarian reform inequality corruption dictatorship etc woman assault we didn't have a dictatorship when there when these when Chavez came in but what has happened is that these these guys the people have realized that what were these left wingers have now you know taken control of all the powers of state taken control of a lot of means of production control of the media and they they want the requestion to end this is what happens when people stay in power too long they become authoritarian and repressive and they're under strain right now so that's exactly what this is this is a real outcry for democracy they want their rights back mr. Kollin Ortega says this is a satanic sect backed by the United States of America to undermine his government well yes that's the government's rhetoric Ortega has never abandoned his left-wing anti imperialist rhetoric but of course when he once he was back in power after 2006 he implemented much more pragmatic policies he actually developed quite a successful economic model in conjunction with the the private sector who representatives of business were included on advisory panels and contracts government contracts were handed out to the parabola sector and this worked rather well the economy was growing about four percent a year or more for several years until very recently and I think the reference to Venezuela really is is quite interesting because they're they're playing by the Venezuela playbook now Venezuela bankrolled the the the the the Ortega government in recent years well 600 million dollars a year worth of oil on very easy terms and credits were flowing from Caracas to Managua miss enabled this this model to to keep functioning it's when it started drying up and one of the things they have to do is increase contributions to pensions by both they did workers and by employers that the the protest broke out Allen you are a demonstrator tell us about how it feels being a protest against Daniel Ortega in the capital Managua what's the atmosphere right now it's been three months already a little tired we never expect to be like protecting for so many times and we have seen horrible things happening and especially for our generation is something really new because we never faced something line like this before so we have to be creative and still like motivating no but with experience and now it's it's hard because the government it's not making anything to to get out of this situation I feel like under everything and the dialogue is isn't working okay can I ask you this question Alan do you fear for your safety is it for easy for you to come openly on the streets to denounce the government like hunting people especially people that is on home protest they are following them and put them put them in the air so it's not really safe staying now and by being visible to them because they are going to Vanessa the heavy-handed approach by the government seems to be paying off at least for the time being do you think that ortega in a way or another has won this battle well I think you might I mean you know the parallels between the what's happening in Nicaragua what happened in Venezuela are tremendous I mean it's exact same formula and you know the protests I'm gonna as well I started for real in 2014 so Venezuela has been at this for four years and the streets are you know there are actually many about 30 protest a day but but they have there is no end in sight to liberation you know to the dictatorship in Venezuela so if that lasted for years and this is more brutal in other words this is sort of more people dead in a shorter period of time a more effective government repression and more brutal government repression then we can see this lasting for a very long time as well either that or it sort of devolves interest of a war which of course Nicaragua has a history of but the people are by and large not armed and the use of the paramilitary forces and the censorship and in the and and the paramilitary forces are on motorcycles are particularly frightening and again we had that too is you know means that this can go on for a long time and it gives the government some form of like plausible deniability you know down down the line but so you know that I unfortunately I think that the the people the student protesters have a very long battle ahead of them I don't see your take a letting go anytime soon and I you know for the last three years at least that we know of the Russians have been training and arming the military and the paramilitary forces in Nicaragua and so they and they have backing by Cuban intelligence as well so this is not you know they're they're no amateurs ok mr. Kollin but at the same time we've seen thousands of Pro Ortega supporters on the streets saying that their revolution is now being hijacked by the West well this reflects the changes that took place in recent years the the money particularly flowing in from Venezuela enabled the government to massively expand the public sector the the state bureaucracy there's a very large number of people in Nicaragua are dependent on on the state for employment and the pro-government demonstrations are very largely composed of people who've been ordered by their superiors to to attend and they know which side their bread is buttered on they don't want to lose their jobs that happened is their livelihood and the the Sandinista youth organization particularly which is very young people who don't remember the Sandinista revolution but they they've been brought up under the the this regime they form a large part of the the the shock troops of the the paramilitary shock troops of the regime Allen there's no indication to suggest that there might be any political dialogue with Ortega in the near future so what is the next step for you for the protesters what are you planning to do in the future but there are like four aspects that students are asking for government that it's the most important is like a stop within violence so it's implied to stop sending the police to the of the cities and for the beginning and stuff but if they continue with the same strategy the citizens the dialogue is not going to start everybody is a bad Idol but we don't still like the government it's really interesting on its in the dialogue as a exit for this situation a student are going to stay on the street like trying to protect themselves because what is following them everywhere but and I think in the next week or something like that it's going to be a mystery because it's a student but many many part of the society here in Nicaragua thanks again the government Alan blundin from Managua thank you very much indeed for your time I appreciate that thank you vanessa is it now boiling down to what should be next for Daniel Ortega is the opposite opposition adamant Ortega must go now yes yes I think that it that that he he must go I mean it so beyond any point of of unfortunately I think of dialogue and I know I keep comparing it it's because the real power laws are so striking you know we've had a intermittent dialogue and the parallels are striking because it's the same people behind it it's the same relationships that you know dialog in Venezuela hasn't worked and it's just not going to not going to happen well partly because you have all of these proxy interest of Russia of Cuba that are that are propping it up so they really need to the fourth they got to sort of stay stay in power and that's even more important relate that in some ways it's a it's a stronger older relationship for them there than it is and when as well so I don't see how dialogue is going to work Daniel Ortega does need to go I think that once you start murdering her own people you know because they want free and fair elections using paramilitary forces and he's been asking by the way another parallel is that they've been asking for and gotten are getting are going to get forces from Venezuela to help keep Daniel Ortega in power so if you're supposed to be a liberator who's against foreign intervention but apparently some foreign intervention is okay as long as it's backed by the same people so they're gonna fight that turf war as well so there's no there's no there's no end in sight he needs to go there's there's no job opportunity I think for a dialogue resolution here mr. column you've been talking previously about the financial aid provided by the Venezuelan government to Ortega Chavez like Ortega like Fidel Castro will all promoting or trying to advance the Bolivarian form of socialism for you the unrest in in Latin America is it a sign that Bolivarian socialism doesn't work anymore well I mean it works as long as there's plenty of money I mean the the the thing about Chavez of course you have a very abundant oil resources which he was able to splash around at the same time undermining the basis of the economy so when the oil menu started running out with him in there that there's no productive capacity in the economy and the state controls that have been introduced meant there were known centers for anybody who still had a business to try and produce that this book of course means that the this kind of model has a very limited lifespan and it was precisely because the Venezuelan model started running out of steam with the collapse in the oil price that the aid to Nicaragua started dwindling on this court the whole Nicaraguan model into into into question as well but of course the Nicaragua has learnt of the Ortega has learned from Maduro from from from Venezuela that if you're prepared to kill as many people as it takes you can dig in and you can defy both domestic pressures and also foreign pressures to to to give way Ortega has said that he's interested in dialogue but in fact he the the the bishops who are supposed to be acting as mediators in the national dialogue he's accused them of being cool mongers themselves I mean the idea of having people mediating talks when the president one side regards them as I was trying to overthrow him it's obviously farcical it's not going to happen funny so do you think that the Roman Catholic Church has the potential to salvage a political settlement no I mean only because I don't think that a political settlement is really going to work here unfortunately I'm you'll forgive my my ongoing skepticism I do think that in theory with a slightly different set of circumstances they could they are they are credible they have moral authority this is Central America the church is very strong which is partly why you see Ortega saying that that that the ones trying to overthrow him are certain some diabolical force right it's because religions still resonate so strongly not only that the church in Central America even more so than then in South then in Venezuela for instance is a huge provider of health care education and everything else so it's very deeply rooted in the grassroots of you know the poor in rural areas and it also commands you know the loyalty even of the highly educated you know professional classes no matter what you go to church you know so I think they could but they could bring sort of the business cars in the poor class together but you remain skeptical about an outcome from this oh but it's just not gonna happen yeah mr. Kollin with we've heard some very strong words from the United States Secretary of State Pompeyo what can the Americans do they still have some leverage given their past involvement in Nicaragua well of course it's one of the the arguments of the government of the Ortega government that their fight against imperialism this is a plot involving in international organized crime in league with coup mongers at home and also with terrorists and the imperialists so this does have a certain traction with some sections of the population the Americans can do what they've done to Venezuela they can introduce sanctions on named individuals stopping them from travelling freezing their bank accounts and generally ramping up the kind of pressure to go beyond that is very problematic president Trump's talked about it they were considering a military intervention saying that as well I don't think even he would consider a military intervention in Nicaragua and of course it's not going to happen in Venezuela there either because it would be very strongly opposed everywhere else in the continent but they can try a widening the scope of the entity of the individual sanctions and of course all kinds of international organization can come out with resolutions deploring what's going on calling on the government to enter a dialogue call off the paramilitaries and so on but this has very limited effect somebody who is determined to hang on to power venice' by the same time we've seen some Sandinistas former allies of Ortega denouncing or at least distancing themselves from the clamp down on the protesters is this something that could convince ultimately Ortega to say I'm off well I hope so I but I still remain skeptical because we've also seen that elsewhere we've seen that I'm going to I mean you you do have some true believers right the Sandinista movement had a reason for being there were people who believed that you know that you you needed a very informed so they they came into existence and you had a based in it in a certain set of circumstances and they you have true believers in the rights of the poor or equality and all of that so what you're seeing is the fracture of the true believers versus the ones who have just sort of become a little cabal or a little cartel of power and money and they're rebelling they view it as a betrayal of their movement now I would be curious to see whether the the people who are speaking out against him are perhaps not is not as deeply located in the part of government money that's a possibility but yeah we'll see mr. Curran isn't it interesting that in more than eight years Nicaragua was run by two political dynasties the Somoza and then the Ortega with Ortega grooming his wife to take over what is the problem here where the country is it more about the political elite or is it that the politics the know the way we know it in the Western world does not really function properly in a place like Nicaragua well the institution's are not as well as tablet and I've caught it the country does have a history a recent history of instability of course these things take time to do to overcome yes one did is T followed by another one and one of the features of the Ortega government is that one thing that's exasperated the private sector is that increasingly sandanista militants and and relatives and so on have been cornering what bits of the economy are still functioning well will we even barley the the general rate of growth has been slowing down these things need time to for political institutions to begin functioning but I think what we have in in a number of Latin American countries were particularly in in Nicaragua is a little determination by the government to make sure this this doesn't happen there's there's no way forward under the present circumstances and then finally the last question would be whether or Tara is going to heed international calls and step aside or stick to a power Venetia Norman Colin Harding thank you very much indeed for your presence today looking forward to seeing you in the near future and thank you too for watching you can see the program again any time by visiting our website aljazeera.com for further discussion go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com forward slash AJ inside story you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle is at aj inside story from be hashem Muhammad and the whole team here bye for now you you
