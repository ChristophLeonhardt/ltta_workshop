Donald Trump apparently dictated a memo to the New York Times lying about Donald Trump juniors meetings with people they believed to be connect to the Russian government so now the Washington Post has broken that story and we know that Trump dictated the memo himself personally and was definitely involved so now we go to his lawyer before this story broke he had gone on air earlier as the Donald Trump jr. emails were going out there and everybody was saying to the president no and here's what his lawyer had to say so the President signed off on that statement does he feel he was misled by his son and by by Jared Kushner if indeed bait and tell him about these emails that they both received the president didn't sign off on on anything was coming back from the g20 the the statement that was released on Saturday was released by Donald Trump jr. and I'm sure in consultation with his lawyers the president wasn't involved in the New York Times says that he was involved in it that several people on the plane were involved in his oh so you're just at your dispute that's incorrect that account from the New York Times yes the president didn't sign off on anything that appears to be a bald-faced lie but he's not done lying yet one more the president was not did not draft the response the response and was came from Donald Trump jr. I'm sure in consultation with his lawyer but we're very careful to say the president didn't draft the statement that isn't what I asked did the president get a heads-up on the statement did he sign off on the statement did was he asked to read the statement before it was given the New York Times on Air Force One no I mean I can't say whether the president was told a statement was gonna be coming from it from his son on that I don't have that I didn't have that conversation and let me let me say this the president but I do want to be clear the president was not involved in the drafting of the statement and did not issue the statement it came from Donald Trump jr. so that that's what I can tell you because that's what we know at the time was not involved in drafting this statement now we know from people on the plane and inside administration officials those are Trump guys saying yes he drafted the statement very much involved in drafting the statement so that is Trump's lawyer clearly lying on channel television maybe you're not surprised but at least for the press they're like okay it's hard to say he says she said on this one he appears to be definitively lying secular puts out a statement now that he's been caught red-handed he says apart from being of no consequence the characterizations are that he was lying aren't misinformed inaccurate and not pertinent I love the beginning of that a part of apart from being of no consequence in other words yeah i mighta lied but come on what's the big deal its of no consequence you gonna bust my jobs over some brazen lies I said on TV come on there's a trump administration we have alternative facts and Donald Trump Jr's attorney is asked about okay wait so who did draft a statement he said it was quote a communal situation in other words yes they definitely drafted it together that couldn't be any clearer if you like this clip of The Young Turks you know there's a whole live two-hour show 6 to 8 p.m. Eastern every day and you could download it or stream in and watch it without ads if you become a member TYT Network comm /join
