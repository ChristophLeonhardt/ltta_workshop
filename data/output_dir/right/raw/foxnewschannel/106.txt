1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:05,504
THIS IS "THE FIVE."

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,106
>> Jesse: PRESIDENT TRUMP

3
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:07,873
HAMMERING DEMOCRATS WITH A STERN

4
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,942
MID-TERM MESSAGE.

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,644
>> President Trump: COME

6
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,646
ELECTION DAY, AMERICANS WILL

7
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,748
REMEMBER KAVANAUGH AND THEY WILL

8
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,549
REMEMBER ALL SORTS OF OTHER

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,518
THINGS, BECAUSE THAT WAS A

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,055
SHAMEFUL ACT.

11
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:28,160
THIS WILL BE AN ELECTION OF

12
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,262
KAVANAUGH, THE CARAVAN, LAW AND

13
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,431
ORDER, AND COMMON SENSE.

14
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:36,769
BUT THE CHOICE COULD NOT BE MORE

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,204
CLEAR, DEMOCRATS PRODUCE MOBS.

16
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,107
REPUBLICANS PRODUCE JOBS.

17
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,042
>> Jesse: DEMOCRATS DON'T SEEM

18
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:43,943
TO BE ABLE TO GET ON THE SAME

19
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,744
PAGE.

20
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,680
FOR EXAMPLE, TEXAS SENATE

21
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,682
HOPEFUL BETO O'ROARKE IS

22
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,418
DOUBLING DOWN ON IMPEACHING

23
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:52,751
TRUMP.

24
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:53,919
>> I WOULD LIKEN IMPEACHMENT TO

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,021
AN INDICTMENT.

26
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,189
THERE IS ENOUGH THERE TO PROCEED

27
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,224
WITH A TRIAL FOR A FULL VETTING

28
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,327
OF THE FACTS, AND MAKES THE BEST

29
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,528
INFORMED DECISION IN THE

30
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,896
INTERESTS OF THIS COUNTRY.

31
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,266
AND OUR FUTURE.

32
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,600
>> Jesse: SENATOR SPARTACUS,

33
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,436
COREY BOOKER, MAKING THIS

34
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,971
BIZARRE CLAIM, CANADA IS MORE

35
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,773
AMERICAN THAN AMERICA.

36
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,343
>> EVERY COUNTRY WE ARE

37
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:18,677
COMPETING WITH, IS DRIVING DOWN

38
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,613
THE COST OF COLLEGE.

39
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,316
GERMANY COST IS 0 AND 4% MEDIAN

40
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,353
INCOME GOING TO COLLEGE.

41
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,922
CANADA, I CAN'T STAND HOW

42
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,256
AMERICAN CANADA IS, TRUDEAU,

43
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,360
HE'S GREAT.

44
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,195
COST ABOUT 6% OR 7% OF MEDIAN

45
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,763
INCOME FOR COLLEGE.

46
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,700
IN AMERICA 5, 2% MEDIAN INCOME.

47
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,769
WHY ARE OTHER NATION MORE

48
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,136
AMERICAN?

49
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,005
>> Jesse: AND NANCY PELOSI,

50
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,339
EXPLAINING WHY SHE DOESN'T

51
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,207
REALLY CARE ABOUT SOCIALIST

52
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,808
POLICIES HURT AMERICANS.

53
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:53,112
>> I THINK THAT WE OWE THE

54
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,281
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO BE THERE FOR

55
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,451
THEM, FOR THEIR FINANCIAL

56
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,053
SECURITY, RESPECTING THE DIGNITY

57
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:01,887
AND WORK OF EVERY PERSON IN THAT

58
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:05,324
COUNTRY.

59
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:09,161
AND IF THERE'S SOME COLLATERAL

60
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,262
DAMAGE, FOR OTHERS WHO DO NOT

61
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,897
SHARE OUR VIEW, SO BE IT.

62
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,032
BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE OUR ORIGINAL

63
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,333
PURPOSE.

64
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,169
>> Jesse: ALL RIGHT, DANA,

65
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,205
SMORGAS BORG OF DEMOCRATIC --

66
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,340
DEMOCRATS TRYING TO GRASP AT

67
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,074
ANYTHING TO GET THE MESSAGE

68
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,542
BEFORE THE ELECTION.

69
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,544
>> Dana: TWO OF THOSE, COREY

70
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,079
BOOKER AND BETO O'ROARKE ARE

71
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,014
RUNNING FOR 2020.

72
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,083
NANCY PELOSI PROBABLY THE MOST

73
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,851
MESSAGE DISCIPLINED, REMEMBER

74
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,319
SHE'S THE ONE SAYING WE'RE NOT

75
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,421
GOING TO DO IMPEACHMENT,

76
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,189
EVERYBODY STOP THAT, BETO

77
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,058
O'ROARKE IS ACTUALLY, SAYING

78
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:39,691
THAT AN INDICTMENT AND

79
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,294
IMPEACHMENT ARE THE SAME THING.

80
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,896
WHICH IS JUST LEGALLY NOT TRUE.

81
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,298
AND HE SHOULD KNOW THAT IF HE'S

82
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:46,832
RUNNING FOR SENATE.

83
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,101
I THINK IF HE ENDS UP LOSING IN

84
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,502
TEXAS, YOU WILL SEE HIM ON ALL

85
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,005
OF THE SHOWS FOR THE NEXT WEEK,

86
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:53,939
WHERE THE HOST WILL BEG HIM TO

87
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,541
RUN IN 2020.

88
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,308
PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD WANT THAT

89
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,309
TO HAPPEN.

90
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,344
THAT IS NOT A STRONG MESSAGE.

91
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,547
COREY BOOKER, WHERE IS HE GIVING

92
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:01,947
IN A SPEECH?

93
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,282
IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

94
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,684
IS HE IN SOUTH CAROLINA?

95
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,420
HE'S HELPING CONGRESSIONAL

96
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:09,922
DEMOCRATS WHO ARE WANTING TO --

97
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:10,689
CHALLENGERS TO REPUBLICANS, THEY

98
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,491
WANT TO WIN.

99
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,192
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING IN SOUTH

100
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,493
CAROLINA.

101
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,528
UNLIKE LINDSAY GRAY MAM, FOR

102
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,897
EXAMPLE, GOING OUT ON A 12-STATE

103
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,265
TOUR AFTER KAVANAUGH SO HE CAN

104
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,700
DO ALL THOSE THINGS.

105
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,001
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HIS CLOSING

106
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,703
ARGUMENT IS GOING TO BE

107
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,307
KAVANAUGH, THE CARAVAN, LAW AND

108
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,108
ORDER AND COMMON SENSE.

109
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,343
2 1/2 WEEKS UNTIL THE ELECTION

110
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,445
IN THIS NEWS CYCLE IS RISKY, BY

111
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,646
SATURDAY WE COULD HAVE A NEW

112
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,014
CLOSING ARGUMENT, IF YOU THINK

113
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,150
ABOUT IT, KAVANAUGH WAS JUST TWO

114
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:38,517
WEEKS AGO.

115
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,219
BUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE BAILING

116
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,953
OUT OF THREE IMPORTANT RACES

117
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,821
TODAY.

118
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:46,458
DOWN IN TEXAS 23rd, WILL HERD,

119
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,292
THAT WAS A DISTRICT THAT HILLARY

120
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,594
CLINTON WON BUT HE'S PULLING

121
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,661
AHEAD, DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO

122
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:50,963
TAKE MONEY OUT OF THAT, PUT

123
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,832
SCHMIDT WHERE ELSE.

124
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,600
ALSO IN NEBRASKA 2 AND MINNESOTA

125
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,068
8.

126
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,402
PLACES WHERE THE DEMOCRATS THINK

127
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,570
THEY HAVE PICKUPS, THOSE ARE OUT

128
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,272
OF REACH FOR THEM.

129
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,039
POSSIBLY, OF COURSE IT DEPENDS

130
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,274
ON TURNOUT.

131
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,642
IF THEY AREN'T GOING TO PUT

132
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:04,776
MONEY IN IT SHOWS SOMETHING.

133
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,779
THE DEMOCRATS' CLOSING MESSAGE,

134
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,647
HEALTHCARE, SPECIFICALLY

135
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:09,448
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, WHICH

136
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,182
WE CAN TALK ABOUT MORE IF YOU

137
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:10,983
WANTED.

138
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,385
IF YOU SEE THEIR ADS, THEY'RE

139
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,221
STARTING TO SAY, CHECK ON

140
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:16,988
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

141
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,689
VOTE FOR A CHECK ON PRESIDENT

142
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,357
TRUMP.

143
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,425
IF YOU ARE A CHALLENGER TO A

144
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,027
REPUBLICAN IN CONGRESS, THE AD

145
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,962
WOULD SAY, JESSE WATTERS VOTES

146
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:24,897
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP 98% OF THE

147
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:25,898
TIME.

148
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,499
YOU DON'T WANT THAT, DO YOU?

149
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,034
THAT'S HOW THEY'RE TRYING TO

150
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,103
MOTIVATE THE BASE.

151
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:31,803
REPUBLICANS --

152
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,906
>> Jesse: JUST 98%?

153
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,808
>> Dana: WELL THE IF YOU HEDGE A

154
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,044
LITTLE, ON A COUPLE OF THINGS.

155
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,846
REPUBLICANS, YOU SEE THEIR ADS,

156
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,314
IT'S IMMIGRATION, AND SUPPORT

157
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,715
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.

158
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,351
THIS IDEA THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT

159
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,986
PRESIDENT TRUMP, IT REALLY IS.

160
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,955
HE SHOULD EMBRACE IT, BASICALLY,

161
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,890
OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL ALL

162
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:52,224
WEEKEND.

163
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,026
AND I THINK THAT THE

164
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,594
REPUBLICANS, IF THEY CAN KEEP

165
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,962
FOCUS, A 4R0689 RACES THAT

166
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,865
DEMOCRATS -- A LOT OF THE RACES

167
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:00,632
DEMOCRATS THOUGHT THEY COULD WIN

168
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,034
WILL BE OUT OF THEIR REACH.

169
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:02,935
>> Jesse: WHAT DO YOU THINK

170
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,870
ABOUT THE MID TERMS, GREG?

171
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,737
>> Greg: I TRY NOT TO THINK

172
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:06,705
ABOUT IT THAT MUCH.

173
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,407
>> Jesse: IT'S YOUR JOB.

174
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,408
>> Greg: WEEKEND COMING UP,

175
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,709
HAVING FUN.

176
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,144
WHEN YOU WATCH THE RALLY, YOU

177
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,579
KNOW WHAT TRUMP'S MESSAGE IS.

178
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,747
IT'S REALLY SIMPLE, YOU KNOW,

179
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,182
IT'S NATIONAL SECURITY, CRIME,

180
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,516
BORDERS.

181
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,117
IT'S LAW AND ORDER.

182
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,219
IT'S REALLY HARD TO FIND OUT

183
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,520
WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE FOR.

184
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,189
YOU ONLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

185
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,523
AGAINST.

186
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,390
HIM, AND THEY'RE ALSO AGAINST

187
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,925
BEING OUT OF POWER.

188
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,894
THAT LEADS YOU INTO THE ARENA OF

189
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,563
WHAT NANCY PELOSI SAID,

190
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,065
PARTICULARLY LOATHSOME, THAT

191
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,366
COLLATERAL DAMAGE IS ACCEPTABLE.

192
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,201
WE KNOW THIS, WE KNOW THAT THE

193
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,736
END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS BY ANY

194
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:38,503
MEANS POSSIBLE, THEY NEED THEIR

195
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,371
POWER.

196
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,907
YOU SAW WITH KAVANAUGH, HIS

197
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,408
FAMILY, COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

198
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,277
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING

199
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,046
NOW WITH THE CARAVAN, THE

200
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,982
COLLATERAL DAMAGE ARE THOSE

201
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,383
PEOPLE WHO MAY SUFFER GRAVE

202
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,918
INJURY TRYING TO CROSS A RIVER

203
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,620
OR BEING SEXUALLY ABUSED.

204
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:55,454
THEY WANT THAT SPECTACLE, THEY

205
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,555
WANT THAT.

206
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,056
THAT'S COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

207
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,826
THEY WANT TO RAISE TAXES,

208
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,461
INCREASE REGULATION THAT, HURTS

209
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,729
BUSINESSES, COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

210
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,565
YOU GO BACK TO OBAMACARE,

211
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,066
COLLATERAL DAMAGE, YOU LOST YOUR

212
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,737
DOCTOR, YOUR RATES WENT UP.

213
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:12,404
THAT WAS COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

214
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,505
BECAUSE THE IDEA OF GOVERNMENT

215
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,773
RUNNING HEALTHCARE, SUCH A BIG

216
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,141
IDEA, DIDN'T MATTER IF YOU LOST

217
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,276
YOUR DOCTOR.

218
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,977
THEIR MESSAGE, IT'S NOT ABOUT

219
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,146
IDEAS, NOT ABOUT PROGRESS, IT'S

220
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:21,780
ABOUT POWER BY ANY MEANS

221
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:22,914
NECESSARY.

222
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,117
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT IDEOLOGY,

223
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,718
THAT MEANS COLLATERAL DAMAGE IS

224
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,987
NOT JUST ACCEPTABLE, IT'S

225
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:29,821
PRACTICALLY THE ONLY THING YOU

226
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,424
HAVE, THEY'RE NOT DEMOCRATS,

227
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,560
THEY'RE DAMAGE-CATS.

228
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,596
>> Jesse: OH, JUAN.

229
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,131
YOU RESPOND TOO THAT.

230
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,365
>> Juan: THE SHOCKING POINT IS

231
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,533
THAT REPUBLICANS DON'T HAVE A

232
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,336
MESSAGE RIGHT NOW.

233
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,470
THE PRESIDENT COMES OUT AND SAYS

234
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,505
THE MESSAGE IS KAVANAUGH AND

235
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,973
CARAVAN.

236
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,908
HE COULD HAVE THROWN IN THERE

237
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,810
KAEPERNICK AND KANYE, JUST GO

238
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,945
FULL RAPPER.

239
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,048
>> Jesse: 3Ks, 4Ks.

240
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,049
>> Juan: HE'S STRUGGLING WITH

241
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,750
THE ABSENCE OF A MESSAGE.

242
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,686
LOOK AT THE ADVERTISING PUT ON

243
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,988
THE AIR, EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT

244
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:03,989
WAS GOING TO BE ALL ABOUT TAX

245
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,991
CUTS FOR THE REPUBLICANS, WE

246
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:06,758
DELIVERED ON THE TAX CUT TO THE

247
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,859
FORGOTTEN MAN.

248
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,195
WHAT YOU SEE IS REPUBLICANS ARE

249
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,163
NOT RUNNING COMMERCIALS ABOUT

250
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,398
TAX CUTS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

251
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,099
HAVING ANY TRACTION WITH THE

252
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,667
VOTERS.

253
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,669
SO THAT MEANS YOU GO BACK TO RED

254
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,005
MEAT, YOU GO BACK TO THE MOST

255
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,006
KIND OF CULTURAL WAR ISSUES YOU

256
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,208
CAN FIND.

257
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,143
FOR TRUMP, YOU KNOW, HIS NUMBER

258
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,978
ONE HIT ON THE ROAD IS ALWAYS

259
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:27,713
IMMIGRATION, BUILD THE WALL, GO

260
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:28,580
AFTER 'EM.

261
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,481
AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S TRYING TO

262
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,183
DO.

263
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,884
TRYING TO GET HIS BASE REVVED UP

264
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,120
FOR THE MID TERMS, WITH THESE

265
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,222
RED MEAT ISSUES.

266
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,891
IT'S SO FAR THAT THE BIG ABSENCE

267
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,793
IS THAT REPUBLICANS DON'T HAVE A

268
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,461
STRONG MESSAGE.

269
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,161
WHEN THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE

270
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,596
GOING TO HAVE A MESSAGE.

271
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,933
I TELL YOU --

272
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:48,500
>> Jesse: THE ECONOMY.

273
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,868
>> Juan: EVEN ON THE IMMIGRATION

274
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,404
ISSUE, AT THE WHITE HOUSE

275
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,305
THEY'RE HAVING BIG FIGHTS

276
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,875
BETWEEN JOHN BOLTEN AND JOHN

277
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,811
KELLER, CHIEF -- KELLY, WITH THE

278
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,579
RHETORIC, A SPIKE, MEAN MANY

279
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,780
COMING AND CROSSING.

280
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,248
THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

281
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:03,982
RIGHT POLICY WOULD BE AT THE

282
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,283
KWHOUS.

283
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,118
BUT THEY WANT TO SAY -- AT THE

284
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,085
WHITE HOUSE.

285
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:07,819
THEY WANT TO SAY IT'S THE

286
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,020
DEMOCRATS.

287
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,789
TRUMP SAYS IT'S THE DEMOCRATS

288
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,224
WHO ARE PAYING TO HAVE THE

289
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,392
CARAVAN COME, JESSE.

290
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,627
THIS IS RIDICULOUS, ABSURD, BUT

291
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,462
I GUESS SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE

292
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,197
SUCKERS OUT THERE AND BUY THAT

293
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:19,598
FOOLISHNESS.

294
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,466
>> Jesse: PEOPLE ARE GOING DOWN

295
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,269
THERE FROM AMERICA TO HELP THE

296
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:24,803
CARAVAN COME NORTH.

297
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,304
>> Juan: OH, COME ON.

298
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,239
>> Jesse: THAT'S IN AN ARTICLE,

299
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,841
I'LL SHOW YOU.

300
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,077
BEFORE WE GET TO KENNEDY, I WANT

301
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,779
TO ADDRESS THE TAX CUTS.

302
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,781
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY TAX CUTS.

303
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,116
WHEN HE SAYS JOBS, WHEN HE SAYS

304
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:39,750
THE ECONOMY, WHEN HE SAYS GDP,

305
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:41,485
THAT'S UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF

306
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:42,052
EVERYTHING HE'S DONE

307
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,356
ECONOMICALLY.

308
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,224
THAT'S INCLUDING GETTING ACROSS.

309
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,159
>> Juan: DOES THAT INCLUDE DRIVE

310
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,929
UP THE DEFICIT 17% IN ONE YEAR?

311
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,865
>> Dana: THAT IS LAUGHABLE, A

312
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,201
DEMOCRAT TALKING ABOUT THE

313
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,102
DEFICIT.

314
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,470
>> Juan: REPUBLICANS SAYING

315
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,505
DEFICITS DON'T WATER BECAUSE

316
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,206
DEMOCRATS AREN'T IN THE WHITE

317
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,307
HOUSE.

318
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,242
>> Jesse: THE U.S. IS COMING

319
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,710
FROM THE LEFT.

320
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,046
>> AS OON INDEPENDENT VOTER AND

321
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,548
WOMAN WHO DOESN'T FIT NEATLY

322
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,350
INTO ANY CATEGORY OR BOX I LOOK

323
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,586
AT FREEDOM-KILLING DEFICIT

324
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,454
SPENDING AND IT IS ATROCIOUS.

325
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,189
FROM BOTH PARTIES.

326
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,990
THEY'RE SO SIMILAR IN THAT

327
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,525
REGARD, IT REALLY IS, THIS IS A

328
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,628
THING THAT IS GOING TO HAMSTRING

329
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:24,996
GENERATIONS AND CURTAIL ECONOMIC

330
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,731
MOBILITY, WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR

331
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,033
THINGS LIKE HIRING NEW EMPLOYEES

332
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,469
AND GOING OUT AND SPENDING

333
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,769
MONEY.

334
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,505
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CONSUMER

335
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,739
OPTIMISM, ONE OF THE BIG DRIVERS

336
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,541
FOR THE ECONOMY, AND FOR THE

337
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,410
STOCK MARKET, THAT IS COMPLETELY

338
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,145
STIFLED WHEN WE FINALLY GET THE

339
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,480
BILL FOR THIS OUTRAGEOUS MONEY

340
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,080
THAT WE'RE SPENDING ON

341
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,381
EVERYTHING.

342
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:47,385
AND NO ONE, PAUL RYAN CAME INTO

343
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,887
POWER AS THIS WONKY SPENDING,

344
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,089
YOU KNOW, HE WAS A PERSON OF

345
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,190
NEUTRALIZED SPENDING AND TALKED

346
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,126
ABOUT CUTTING COSTS.

347
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,428
AND THE DEBT IS NOW $21

348
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,263
TRILLION.

349
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,365
WHEN NANCY PELOSI GOES OUT, AND

350
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,666
WHEN SHE IS THE MOUTHPIECE FOR

351
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,169
THIS PARTY, WHEN SHE TALKS ABOUT

352
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,938
THE HOUSE IS GOING TO ONCE AGAIN

353
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,707
REST IN DEMOCRAT HANDS, THAT

354
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,375
RILES UP REPUBLICANS MORE THAN

355
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,343
ANYTHING, AND INDEPENDENTS,

356
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,077
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT A LIKABLE

357
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,512
PERSON.

358
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,146
SHE'S NOT ONLY UNLIKABLE, SHE'S

359
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:15,814
A PERSON WHO DOESN'T HAVE A

360
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:16,948
MESSAGE.

361
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,083
YOU CAN JOKE THAT REPUBLICANS

362
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,551
DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE, AND YOU

363
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,386
MAY NOT AGREE WITH IT, BUT

364
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,656
SOMETHING IS SIMPLE, AS JOBS NOT

365
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,691
MOBS THAT, RESONATES.

366
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,126
PEOPLE WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE

367
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,829
JOBS AND MONEY FOR THEIR KIDS

368
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,931
THAN RUN UP AGAINST A WALL OF

369
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:33,899
PROTESTERS WHO ARE GOING TO CALL

370
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,768
THEM NAMES AND SPIT ON THEM AND

371
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:37,869
STOP THEIR CAR AND VANDALIZE

372
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,806
NICE CITIES.

373
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,408
>> Greg: COREY BOOKER, WE
