as has often been the case over the past year year and a half Friday has brought another round of not just big news but in this case indictments in the Moller investigation of the last presidential election and these indictments they're pretty big ones so we're now we're gonna go to a press conference from earlier today Rob Rosen sign who's going to explain some of those indictments the indictment charges 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies for committing federal crimes while seeking to interfere in the United States political system including the 2016 presidential election the defendants posed as politically and socially active Americans advocating for and against particular candidates they establish social media pages and groups to communicate with unwitting Americans after the election the defendants allegedly staged rallies to support the president-elect while simultaneously staging rallies to protest his election for example the defendants organized one rally to support the president-elect and another rally to impose to oppose him both in New York on the same day now there is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election he had neglected to mention there was one American that was also charged Donald J Trump ladies and gentlemen we got him yeah just kidding okay no the Trump is not charged I know that as soon as you anyone saw Muller indictments Russian meddling no so the Russians are charged and and they there's one guy who was a conspirator of some sort that set up the fake accounts here but there's no Ally pinedo of California yes Ricky strong no although they're still looking into them hey and you should be looking into them as well at youtube.com slash TYT sports anyway but no no one not not anyone in his campaign that was knowingly involved at least with these people in that word now that are now charged with meddling in the election yeah so let's talk a little bit more about those charges all there's 13 individuals three organizations all were charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States 3 with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud and five with aggravated identity theft and we have a statement from the initial indictment which is it's it's a little bit long we've looked through it it's 37 pages but we're gonna give you some of the broad strokes it says this from in or around 2014 to the present defendants knowingly and intentionally conspired with each other and with persons known and unknown to the grand jury that's interesting too defrauded the United States by impairing obstructing and defeating the lawful functions of the government through fraud and deceit for the purpose of interfering with the US political and electoral processes including the presidential election of 2016 and so many of the actual indictments have to do with fraud of various natures the ways that these organizations used money and hid the fact they were using the money in that way the way they transferred that information and coordinated all of that that thus giving you a lot of these fraud charges all right so John's absolutely right that that one word in there is very interesting known and unknown to the grand jury so what Don Rumsfeld ears are ringing so the known knowns are that that these guys did conspire and what they don't know is are there other Americans that they conspired with so they're not foreclosing that possibility they're not saying oh it's definitive that the Trump team did not work with these guys they did not say that okay but right now don't get me wrong there is no evidence presented of that okay so just giving you the full context so and if if they conclude all their investigations then you can say no they didn't have any evidence that the Trump team work with the Russians in the meddling of the elections wittingly right but that's super important yeah yeah yeah I mean I would probably mention the fact that you there's a lot of unwitting people after all as he points out this extremely complicated and well-funded organization which is still there and is still trying to manipulate not just our elections and our politics but a number of other countries would hide their identity and try to fool everyone into thinking they're regular Americans and thus many of the people they would communicate with thought they were speaking with Americans and so that makes you if you worked with them unwitting however if you've got an email saying that Russia wanted to elect your father and was going to give you information damaging to Hillary Clinton to do that and then you responded that you loved it and then you have a meeting with that person you're slightly more witting even if you're a generally unwitting sort of person yeah and and now rod Rosenstein emphasized there in the clip that we showed you now they did try to agitate on different sides and that is true but the context of that is very important so they pretended to be black activists for example on the left as well as Trump supporters on the right and Rosenstein kind of left it there in the clip that you guys just saw now there's two reasons why he might not have given it the proper context one he's a Republican to Trump's been all over his ass so he wants to say that difficult votes I do it see Trump I was fair Trump I was fair and remember I'm a Republican and so the Democrats might've also been tricked by the Russians and and that definitely did happen but it's super important to point out the severity and the magnitude on each side yes see the response yes so if the amount of support that went to Trump as opposed to the Democrats was overwhelming it was mainly in favor of Trump overwhelmingly in favor of Trump okay now if Trump didn't have anything to do with it okay then you take it for what it's worth well let's go get these guys and be done with it right but they clearly wanted Trump to win yeah and even some of the stuff that they had on the left was aimed at black activists for example but told them dovo and and go support Hillary just stay home instead so and there are people who might have bought into don't vote or go vote for anyone but Hillary Clinton but even that was aimed at make sure Trump wins yeah yeah they were trying to drive apathy and try to stop as many people as possible from voting and in particular and they make clear in the indictment throw they were targeting various religious and racial minority groups they didn't want those people to feel active it's one of the ways they were sowing discord if you like this video bless your
