their bowls because if you saw my last
vlog then you will know me and how he
bought them some new balls and there is
there is nothing we could have done to
make them eat of them so let's see how
they are this morning yeah mmm the
answer to that is nope still not eating
out of the balls
oh for goodness sake I got an ace sauce

through this before I get dressed for
the day and see if there's anything in

tortoise shell buttons on it it's like
stretchy material that's nice oh I love
this this is a little spotty skirt this
is from pull and bear again I love
polymer and it's got pockets here
buttons down it and a little split down
the front I'm half tempted to wear that
today as well maybe with a pair of bands
oh and then I got this this is pull and
bear again I think woman collection
I'm bear yeah this is pullin bear again
this little spotty crop top that's off
the shoulder and it's got like a little
thrill on it I love that excuse the
noise they're playing with a toy I think
this is a little jumpsuit yeah this is
nice brand is there Abercrombie and
Fitch
it's like a trouser 3/4 length jumpsuit
which I really like this would be lovely
with a white t-shirt underneath actually
another potential for today speaking of
white t-shirts I got this one with
frilly sleeves that was just an ASIS one
okay look at this little body it's got
really it's a very straight cut fit but
it's so cute because it's like all
freely
that's so cute love is this another
jumpsuit I need to stop with the
jumpsuit this one is but it's more it's
got massive like drop crotch so I was
thinking this is more like to throw on
after a bath or like in the evenings are
when I'm having like a day at home it's
just it looked really comfortable so
it's got elastic on the bottom but then
it's like hugely baggy around the crotch
area and then like that on the front and
then I got this shirt how cute is this
this is just a sauce and it's got short
sleeves v-front neck lines little
buttons down all the way down it and
then it has these little eyes on it so
there we go I will leave a link to
everything I've just shown in the
description box so if you want to go and
have a look
it's all down there right I'm happy with
everything actually Oh some free Purcell
now that I finished filming you've
stopped playing why is that well I have
you both frozen and if you're wondering
whether they ate their breakfast or not
the answer is no I left it there for
ages I walked away I have my own
breakfast and I went back and they were
still barking at the balls so I have to
go back to using the original bowl but I
emptied the water out of put knowledge
food in let Nala a her food emptied that
cleaned that out put buzzes food in
there emptied that clean that out and
then put more water in it I think today
on the way to the office I might have to
stop off at another place at home and
see if they have the balls because they
ain't gonna eat out those bowls right
I'm gonna jump in the shower and then do
my makeup
