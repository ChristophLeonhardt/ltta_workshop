here's Obama here is the speech that they sent around that made a big splash on Twitter because it sounded like a rebuke to Donald Trump this cup number one lecture about you have to believe in facts without facts there's no basis for cooperation if I say this is a podium and you say this is an elephant it's going to be hard for us to cooperate unfortunately too much of politics today seems to reject the very concept of objective truth people just make stuff up they just make stuff up we see it in the growth of state-sponsored propaganda we see it in internet driven fabrications we see it in the in the blurring of lines between news and entertainment we see the the utter loss of shame among political leaders where they're caught in a lie and they just double down and they lost them all so that's what Obama said but I wanted you to hear what I heard so I had the guys here Rob and Emily and Austin I haven't put together what I heard as Obama was speaking this is another one of these things that I didn't think I had to lecture about you have to believe in facts without facts there's no basis for cooperation blistering report tonight out saying the Obama administration in general and former attorney General Eric Holder in particular repeatedly lied to the family of a slain Border Patrol officer about the weapons used in his death and stonewalled efforts to get at the truth it's gonna be hard for us to cooperate let me take the IRS situation first I first learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this unfortunately too much of politics today seems to reject the very concept of objective truth there was a hateful video that was disseminated on the Internet it had nothing to do with the United States government and it's one that we find disgusting and reprehensible it's been offensive to many many people around the world that sparked violence in various parts of the world including violence directed against Western facilities including our embassies and consulates people just make stuff up if in fact IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that have been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups then that's outrageous and there's no place for it and they have to be held fully accountable we see it in the growth of state-sponsored prop again you're saying if you were to rupture there at all no that's not what I'm saying that's actually no no but I want to know what you were say you're the lead absolutely you're saying no corruption not no there were some there was some boneheaded decisions Sloan heads out of a mass corruption not even mass corruption not even a smidgen of corruption okay we see it in internet driven fabrications the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order that's just not the case we see it in the in the floor lines between news and entertainment we have stopped the spread of nuclear weapons in this region because of this deal the international community will be able to verify that the Islamic Republic of Iran will not develop a nuclear weapon we see them the utter loss of shame among political leaders where they're caught in a lie and they just double down and they lost them all you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it if you like the plan you have you can keep it if you like your plan and you like your doctor you won't have to do a thing you keep your plan if you like your health care plan you will be able to keep your health care plan if you've got health insurance you can keep it if you like your health care plan you will keep your plan it was exactly the same his form of line I noticed Obama's form of line when he was a candidate I actually wrote a piece for The Wall Street Journal that the Wall Street Journal wouldn't didn't publish and I sent it to them while he was running the first time the first time he was running in 2008 saying this guy doesn't lie like other politicians lives he lies with a smoothness and an ease and an immediacy that is not even like other politicians when he says Bill Ayers was just a guy in the neighborhood when he says oh yeah I just never really heard what Jeremiah Wright said in church even being there for 20 years he lied and he his lies were much more substantial than Trump's Trump's lies oh you know I said 'would when I wouldn't men wouldn't there really carnival barker lies Obama lied about substance and and they just worshipped him and that is the difference is the kind of you know the noise that overrides everything that Donald Trump does and didn't override the silence that surrounded everything that Obama did Obama is still over there
