it's just so ungrateful let's praise us going in and it does say something about the culture the culture is obsessed with politics now and I don't know if that symptom or if that's cause but everything was about politics so even the jokes they weren't even clever they were just this low-hanging fruit so Jimmy Kimmel made a joke about how Trump is a racist tee-hee-hee right that we never heard that one before Wow great and he made a joke about how Mike Pence was made uncomfortable by that movie about pederasty as though we shouldn't be uncomfortable with it and like Mike bench could give a rat's whether they make that move right right is he like America it certainly didn't see it didn't see it you know I have to just say one thing I was talking about the difference between right-wing culture which is open-minded hilarious we're always laughing and arguing and all this stuff and left-wing culture was just furious the funny thing was that Donald Trump went to that press dinner the other night he was funnier than Kimmel he breaking joke he made it he made a joke where he said I man he said to the New York Times I'm glad you're here you're in New York icon I'm in New York icon too and the only difference is I still own my building I mean that's pretty good that's pretty good material you know and Kimmel is sitting there doing garbage base it's a low bar Kimmel hasn't been funny since the 90s I think there was a joke on Family Guy about how they were gonna tune in every night and watch Jimmy Kimmel try you know he isn't a great talent but he's either really just do based he made a couple of pot jokes right those were the funniest jokes he made all night were about Steven Spielberg having pot on him and it's just that that's the hue that is the highest form of humor that this guy is capable of and it's really sad because there were a couple decent speeches Sam Rockwell who deserved his award yep in a category of great performances he gave a nice speech it was fun it was modern it was it wasn't some great eloquent thing but it was just gracious and he said thank you gary oldman comes out and thanks america for giving him opportunities Winston Churchill for his greatness and his mother and the Academy and he left that now mercifully them because we had to reverse it so it used to be Best Actor was the last who came after Best Actress now they flipped it because me too hashtag me too
