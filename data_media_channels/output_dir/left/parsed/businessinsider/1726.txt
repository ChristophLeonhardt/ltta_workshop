the worst thing an enemy could do to our
country is to attack our ports and to
sink ships in the channels and to stop
the flow of Commerce if an enemy wanted
to make a real and lasting impact then

impacting Western Europe you're
impacting South America you're impacting
China if you're driving down and causing
loss of value in assets and equities
you're really having a huge impact so if
there were as an enemy sophisticated
enough to figure out how to
simultaneously attack multiple ports and
shut down for an enduring time the
ability of East Coast West Coast the
southern state ports to me that's that's
our big vulnerability
