former British Chancellor George Osborne has predicted that the UK will maintain freedom of movement with the EU freedom of movement is one of the four freedoms of the European Union so when we leave the EU we were expected to scrap freedom of movement in fact that's one of the things we voted for if you were a brexit ear we voted to leave the EU so that we could control our own borders and freedom of movement would go and one of the reasons Barney a has been so difficult to negotiate with is because of this freedom of movement issue in order to stay in their internal market we have to keep freedom of movement along with the three other so-called freedoms now the politicians want us to stay in this internal market despite the fact that we voted to leave it but hey-ho what's reality these days the politicians don't seem to care about anything you'll say one thing they'll do the other Barney a has advised the politicians at every step of the way throughout these and negotiations that have been going on for well two years now two years crazy every step of the way is remind them that it simply is impossible to stay in the internal market without having those four freedoms so it's interesting to hear that George Osborne is predicting that the UK will maintain freedom of movement I wonder if that's a sign of things to come sky reports on this and they say George Osborne has predicted there will still be free movement of people after brexit hinting that his close friend Michael Gove supports the idea the former Chancellor said the emerging option was that Britain will remain in the European Economic Area EEA after it formally quits the EU in March next year the EEA is an area where people's services and goods flow freely across borders all 28 EU countries are in it apart from Croatia which is in it with provisions as well as Iceland Norway Liechtenstein and Switzerland I've discussed this before actually on this show specifically Michael goes plan to maintain free movement because Gove had been reported as talking about staying in the EE as a part of brags if that was his idea at least it seemed to be one of one thing that he was quite keen on that he kept talking to politicians about and he wanted that so that we could stay in the single market of course a betrayal of Bragg's it but at the big tent festival in Cambridge which was if he had not heard of it it was an idea of bringing people together outside of the realms of a normal political party conference bringing lots of different ideas together and talking about stuff when I say lots of different ideas you can bet the only people there were led down Tories and labor but I digress Osborn said that this festival I first started having conversations about Europe with him when we were 18 years old he who has impeccable brexit credentials and is probably one of the most influential people over 20 or 30 years and bringing Britain to the point that we decided to leave suggests that we should remain in the EE a people who haven't even thought about our membership of the EU say that's a betrayal I think it's an interesting option so could we stay in the EEA as part of this checkers deal or at least a change of the checkers deal a renegotiation could the new plan be to stay in the EEA and maintain freedom of movement well I've said for a while actually that I think Theresa May is gonna maintain freedom of movement she's just gonna rename it and in fact that's what the provisions are in the checkers do she says the freedom of movement will go but it still makes it easier for people across Europe to come to the UK as opposed to the rest of the world that's free movement in my books Sarris think that it will be kept and it will be renamed and it sounds to me with this news that maybe I'm right catch up with all the rebel stories on our brand-new app which you can download now from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store you
