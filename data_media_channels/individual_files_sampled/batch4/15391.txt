when you read the allegations against Brokaw one woman said that he came up behind her and tickled her now in one context that could be really creepy in another it's not Harvey Weinstein esque you know this is somebody you work with every day and you have a friendly rapport and a friendly banter and it's a little frenetic in the newsroom and you come up behind them and you're like hey how you doing in your run you're I mean maybe it's inappropriate yeah right - the level of sexual harassment that should cost somebody their job or jail time no even in the context of it being creepy and inappropriate and this is something that Matt Damon got almost excommunicated from Hollywood for when he said that there are degrees of this type of stuff let me just say as a woman if a drunk guy at an office party or a bar something a bar someone I don't know if it walks up to me and squeezes my waist or slaps my butt or something like that yeah it's gross and it's weird and I would probably throw my drink at him but the the emotional repercussions that I would suffer from that are almost non-existent compared to the emotional repercussions that I would suffer from something like a like sexual assault or rape so please bringing up these these tiny instances of you know someone tickling you that muddies the water of people who have legitimate concerns and complaints hi great look I've always said that I've always said that people who cry wolf do a real disservice to true victims number one absolutely desensitize the public to it with these frivolous allegations that they're frivolous number two they tie up law enforcement and criminal justice system resources when they can be deployed when they could otherwise be deployed to go after the real bad guys and that's the problem right not 1992 somebody said he'd tickle them it could have been construed in many many ways what's one person's inappropriate is another's hey that's my buddy you know joking around with me and then a 50 year old allegation that shouldn't even be factored in the totality of the circumstance it's Jenna and honestly tickling like I'd be more pissed off if somebody walked by me and crop-dusting me tickling is not a big deal yeah I was actually ready to file a complaint against you when you didn't order a second round the shots last time we were in DC when I did or didn't when you did it that maybe you didn't I just forgot for the second round but I probably ordered the fifth and sixth round yeah that's pretty true I think you did it no seriously I don't like these frivolous allegations no look when we hear about when Matt Lauer did that's a little different that's like traveling someone in his office but the hidden buzzer okay that's a special kind of weirdo that warranted the action taken Harvey Weinstein should be spending the rest of his life in a jail cell well slansky should be in a jail cell for the rest of his life but I don't know tickling somebody outside the clothing maybe they you know we don't know if she was flirting with him we don't know if they had a flirtation going on we don't know what was going on back then what man to come forward 26 years later somebody else 50 years later and no one's really alleging unless I've missed something Amanda no one's really alleging anything from Tom Brokaw beyond that right correct yeah and and you know it's almost a symptom of our culture in general this conflation of you know degrees of severity we've seen this we saw it throughout the the 2016 election season with the term racism people people would call someone a racist for something completely innocuous and now as a result when you call someone a racist it really doesn't even hurt because it's like wow that's just that's that's the argument that you resort to when you don't have something substantial to offer I want to keep bringing you this content every single day I want to keep bringing you this show as comprehensively as I can to help me do that I subscribe to our premium service at wwww forward slash goes
