CATASTROPHIC LIFE-THREATENING

15
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:28,432
DAMAGE, STORM SURGE, AND

16
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:30,868
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS IN EXCESS

17
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,469

18
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,737

WE GET INTO THE NEXT COUPLE

23
00:00:41,346 --> 00:00:45,516
HOURS AS WE APPROACH LANDFALL.

24
00:00:45,517 --> 00:00:48,552
THE STORM IN THE TEXTBOOKS IS A

25
00:00:48,553 --> 00:00:50,187
PERFECT LOOKING HURRICANE.

26
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:53,324
ALL FOUR QUADRANTS HAVE FILLED

27
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:53,591

28
00:00:53,592 --> 00:00:59,964

00:01:08,607 --> 00:01:09,039
APALACHACOLA.

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,107
WE'RE EXPECTING A LANDFALL

35
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:11,675
BETWEEN 1:00 AND 3:00, YET TO BE

36
00:01:11,676 --> 00:01:12,443
DETERMINED, BUT THE STRENGTH OF

37
00:01:12,444 --> 00:01:13,744
THE STORM IS GOING TO BE

38
00:01:13,745 --> 00:01:15,179
UNFORTUNATELY THE LEGACY OF IT.

39
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,414
STORM SURGE IS GOING TO BE

40
00:01:17,415 --> 00:01:17,915
AN ISSUE.

41
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,383
TAMPA BAY, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 3

42
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:22,620
TO 4 FEET, BUT AS WE GET UP

43
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:25,556
NORTHWARD TO HORSESHOE BAY, FISH

44
00:01:25,557 --> 00:01:27,358
CREEK, SAINT MARKS, WE COULD

45
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,393
HAVE A STORM SURGE UP TO

46
00:01:29,394 --> 00:01:31,428
14 FEET, THAT IS ABOVE YOUR

47
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:32,963
HOMES IN SOME CASES.

48
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:35,299
THAT IS GOING TO BE

49
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,933
EXTRAORDINARILY DANGEROUS.

50
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:37,434
THE STORM SURGE, THE WATER PUSH

51
00:01:37,435 --> 00:01:39,470
IS WHAT KILLS THE MOST PEOPLE IN

52
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:40,571
THESE HURRICANES.

53
00:01:40,572 --> 00:01:46,577
FLOODING IS GOING TO BE A BIG

54
00:01:46,578 --> 00:01:47,411
CONCERN, 4 TO 8 INCHES, ISOLATED

55
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:48,112
AMOUNTS OF 12 INCHES PLUS.

56
00:01:48,113 --> 00:01:48,846
THIS IS GOING TO MOVE NORTH AND

57
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:49,580
EASTWARD AND COULD AFFECT AREAS

58
00:01:49,581 --> 00:01:50,347
IMPACTED BY HURRICANE FLORENCE.

59
00:01:50,348 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.
