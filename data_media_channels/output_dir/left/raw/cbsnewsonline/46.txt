1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,537
IN ADDITION, YOU HAVE MENTIONED 

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:05,638
THAT HE WAS DECLARED BY THE 

3
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:07,040
JUDGE AFTER A HEARING AS A 

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,607
SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR. 

5
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,109
THAT WILL AFFECT HIM ONCE HE IS 

6
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:09,676
OUT OF PRISON. 

7
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,877
>> THE ONE BIG PIECE OF 

8
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,245
INFORMATION THAT WE ARE STILL 

9
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:20,453
WAITING FOR IS THE BAIL ISSUE 

10
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,588
AND IF HE GOES STRAIGHT TO 

11
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:22,989
PRISON OR IF HE IS OUT FOR A 

12
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:23,456
TIME BEFORE HAND. 

13
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:25,158
>> THAT MAY BE FOR HIM JUST AS 

14
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,159
IMPORTANT AS THE THREE TO 10 

15
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:26,393
YEARS. 

16
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,894
BECAUSE HE WILL MOVE IF THIS 

17
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:34,000
JUDGE DENIES IT THEY -- THE 

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,934
LAWYERS WILL IMMEDIATELY GO TO 

19
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,069
AN APPELLATE JUDGE AND THEY 

20
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,504
WILL ASK THAT HIS SENTENCE  BE 

21
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,071
STAYED, PENDING APPEAL. 

22
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,405
WHAT THEY MEAN BY THAT IS THAT 

23
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:40,907
THEY WANT HIM TO GO HOME WHILE 

24
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:41,641
THE APPEAL IS PENDING. 

25
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,477
AND THE REASON FOR THAT, IN HIS 

26
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:49,783
PARTICULAR SITUATION IS HIS 

27
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:49,983
AGE. 

28
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:50,817
BECAUSE HIS APPEAL, WHICH COULD 

29
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,553
TAKE A COUPLE OF YEARS, AND IF 

30
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,621
IT IS ULTIMATELY DECIDED IN HIS 

31
00:00:54,621 --> 00:01:02,862
FAVOR, NO COURT REALLY WANTS 

32
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:03,796
HIM SERVING A SENTENCE THAT 

33
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:04,464
COULD BE REVERSED. 

34
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,298
BUT THIS JUDGE IS VERY 

35
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,432
CONFIDENT, I'M SURE, THAT HE 

36
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:07,167
DID NOT COMMIT ADDITIONAL 

37
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:07,400
ERROR. 

38
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,501
>>> WE MENTIONED THAT YOU ARE 

39
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:12,205
OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM AND WHAT 

40
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:12,972
ARE YOU HEARING AND SEEING 

41
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:13,205
THERE? 

42
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:14,073
>> Reporter: WE ARE HEARING 

43
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:16,142
PEOPLE LOUD.  

44
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:17,177
WE ARE HEARING PEOPLE SHOUTING. 

45
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,211
WE HEAR THAT THE JUDGE SAID 

46
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:32,091
THAT THE VERDICT, THE VERDICT 

47
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,393
OF THE JURY FROM APRIL MUST BE 

48
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,360
HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR. 

49
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,094
WE ARE ALSO HEARING THAT 

50
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,228
SEVERAL OF THE ACCUSERS OF BILL 

51
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:37,397
COSBY ARE IN THAT COURTROOM 

52
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,298
AND, AS THAT SENTENCE WAS READ, 

53
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,232
THEY WERE ARM AND ARM. 

54
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,167
SOME OF THEM WERE EVEN SOBBING. 

55
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:51,110
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT 

56
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,978
ANDREA COSTAND MUST BE FEELING 

57
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:52,846
AT ALL OF THIS. 

58
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:53,846
SHE ACTUALLY READ A VERY SMALL 

59
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:54,681
PORTION OF HER VICTIM'S IMPACT 

60
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,615
STATEMENT YESTERDAY BUT WE WERE 

61
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,117
ABLE TO GET A FULL COPY OF WHAT 

62
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:57,950
SHE SAID TO THE COURT. 

63
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,652
I WANT TO READ SOME OF THIS TO 

64
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,053
GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT SHE 

65
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:01,788
MUST BE FEELING RIGHT NOW. 

66
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,922
SHE SAYS I HAVE OFTEN ASKED 

67
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:03,957
MYSELF WHY THE BURDEN OF BEING 

68
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,891
THE SOLE WITNESS IN TWO 

69
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,025
CRIMINAL TRIALS HAD TO FALL TO 

70
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:06,191
ME. 

71
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:07,327
THE PRESSURE WAS ENORMOUS, SHE 

72
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,494
SAID, BUT I HAD TO TESTIFY. 

73
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:09,628
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DEAL. 

74
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:11,130
SHE GOES ON TO SAY THAT BILL 

75
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:11,697
COSBY TOOK MY BEAUTIFUL, 

76
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:14,867
HEALTHY, YOUNG SPIRIT AND 

77
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:15,235
CRUSHED IT. 

78
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,536
HE ROBBED ME OF MY HEALTH AND 

79
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,537
VITALITY, MY OPEN NATURE, AND 

80
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,771
MY TRUST IN MYSELF AND OTHERS. 

81
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,072
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO LOOKING 

82
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:20,339
FORWARD. 

83
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:21,774
I WANT TO GET TO THE PLACE 

84
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:22,709
WHERE THE PERSON THAT I WAS 

85
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:33,019
MEANT TO BE GETS A SECOND 

86
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:33,286
CHANCE. 

87
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,153
SO AGAIN, JUST TO REITERATE, 

88
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,255
THIS CASE GOES BACK ALMOST 3 

89
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,289
YEARS WHEN BILL COSBY WAS 

90
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:36,822
CHARGED WITH AGGRAVATED 

91
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:38,458
INDECENT ASSAULT AT THE END OF 

92
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,526
DECEMBER 2015, CLOSE TO THE 

93
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:41,828
TIME THAT THE STATUTE OF 

94
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,162
LIMITATIONS WAS ABOUT TO RUN 

95
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:43,563
OUT. 

96
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:44,297
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 

97
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,999
REOPENS THIS CASE AND GOES TO 

98
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:56,142
TRIAL IN 2017. 

99
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,577
AS YOU RECALL, IT WAS IN HIS 

100
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,411
TRIAL BECAUSE THE JURY COULD 

101
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,445
NOT REACH A UNANIMOUS VERDICT. 

102
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,580
IN THAT SECOND TRIAL, IN APRIL, 

103
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,614
IT WAS A CONVICTION ON ALL 

104
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:14,460
COUNTS FOR BILL COSBY, AS YOU 

105
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,228
MENTIONED, HEARING THAT HE WILL 

106
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,562
BE GOING TO STATE PRISON, 3 TO 

107
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:17,197
10 YEARS SENTENCE. 

108
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,231
WE ARE GETTING EMAILS AS WE 

109
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,164
SPEAK FROM THE PEOPLE INSIDE. 

110
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:20,133
IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT 

111
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:20,867
THE APPEALS ARGUMENTS ARE 

112
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,001
UNDERWAY, SO WE ARE NOT SURE 

113
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,303
WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF THE 

114
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,404
BAIL, WHETHER OR NOT BILL COSBY 

115
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,704
WILL BE ABLE TO GO HOME TONIGHT 

116
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:38,651
OR IF YOU WILL SPEND TIME  IN A 

117
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,251
COUNTY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY 

118
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:40,153
AND THEN BE TRANSFERRED TO THE 

119
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:40,920
STATE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTE OF 

120
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,187
PHOENIX. 

121
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,055
A COURT OFFICIAL EARLIER TOLD 

122
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,356
ME THAT IF HE IS REMANDED, HE 

123
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,257
WILL BE BROUGHT OUT IN 

124
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,258
HANDCUFFS AND PROCESSED AT THE 

125
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:45,891
MONTGOMERY COUNTY CORRECTIONAL 

126
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:46,893
FACILITY ABOUT SIX MILES FROM 

127
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,093
HERE. 

128
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:47,827
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE WAITING TO 

129
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,028
HEAR FROM SOME OF THOSE 

130
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:49,762
ACCUSERS AS WELL AS ANDREA 

131
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:50,863
COSTAND, THE WOMAN AT THE HEART 

132
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:51,798
AND SOUL OF THIS CASE. 

133
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,967
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. úWE HAV 

134
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,135
THE COURTROOM WHO HAS SAID THAT 

135
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,236
THERE WERE SEVEN VICTIMS IN A 

136
00:03:57,236 --> 00:04:08,681
ROW BEHIND HIM, ARM IN ARM, ALL 

137
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,582
CRYING, AS THIS TOOK PLACE. 

138
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,416
BILL COSBY, AGAIN, SENTENCED 

139
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,651
TODAY, MOST AGO TO THREE TO 10 

140
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,985
YEARS IN PRISON. 

141
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:14,153
HE WAS TALKING A LITTLE BIT 

142
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:17,957
ABOUT WHERE HE WILL END UP. 

143
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,726
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT? 

144
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,027
>> SHE IS CORRECT THAT HE WILL 

145
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,060
BE ASSESSED FIRST AT THE 

146
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,265

00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:31,704
GOING TO GO INTO A STATE PRISON 

148

SYSTEM. 

149
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:33,106
WHEN HE IS ASSESSED, HE COULD 

150
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:33,973
WIND UP IN GENERAL POPULATION 

151
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:40,146
WHICH ARE CELLS OF TWO EACH AND 

152
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,547
HE COULD END UP IN A MEDICAL

00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,282

154
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,883

DIFFICULTIES. 

162
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:54,761
>> BREAKING NEWS, AND WE HEARD 

163
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,396
THAT THE JUDGE HAS REACHED YOU 

164
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:07,073
REFUSED HIS REQUEST FOR BAIL. 

165
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:07,740
STRAIGHT TO PRISON.

PENDING APPEAL, BASED ON ERRORS 

169
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:11,644
THAT THEY BELIEVE WERE 

170
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,412
COMMITTED AT THE TRIAL. 

171
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,613
THEY HAVE A LAUNDRY LIST OF 

172
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:13,846
ERRORS. 

173
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:14,480
THEY HAVE SUBSTANTIAL ISSUES 

174
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,414
BUT THEY ARE NOT FRIVOLOUS. 

175
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:18,584

SHE SAID I HAVE OFTEN ASKED 

250
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:38,637
MYSELF WHY THE BURDEN OF BEING

THE PRESSURE WAS ENORMOUS BUT I 

255
00:10:58,524 --> 00:10:59,658
HAD TO TESTIFY BUT IT WAS THE 

256
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:00,559
RIGHT THING TO DO.

CRUSHED IT, SHE SAYS. 

260
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:04,363
HE ROBBED ME OF MY HEALTH AND 

261
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,131

262
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,231
TRUST IN MYSELF AND IN OTHERS.

264
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:07,466
FORWARD. 

265
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:08,667
I WANT TO GET TO THE PLACE 

266
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:09,935

268
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:16,742
CHANCE. 

269
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:17,743
ON TOP OF BEING SENTENCED TO

VIOLENT PREDATOR. 

274
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:21,781
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 

275
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,882
IT MEANS THAT HE WILL BE 

276
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,216
REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A SEX 

277
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,584
OFFENDER FOR THE REST OF HIS

WELL AS HIS NAME, ADDRESS, AND 

283
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:31,891
WHAT HE HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF. 

284
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,025
IT WILL APPEAR ON THE STATE 

285
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,994

286
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:41,400

TIME AT HOME ON HOUSE ARREST. 

290
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:45,103
THE PROSCUTION WAS ADAMANT 

291
00:11:45,103 --> 00:11:49,341
THAT IT WOULD BE A GET OUT OF 

292
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,643
JAIL FREE CARD ACCORDING TO THE 

293
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,076
DISTRICT ATTORNEY. 

294
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:51,844
THEY WERE REALLY OFFERING TO 

295
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:52,912
SEE THAT BILL COSBY SPENT TIME 

296
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:53,279
BEHIND BARS. 

297
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,580
I AM HEARING A LITTLE BIT OF 

298
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,783
ACTIVITY BEHIND ME. 

299
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,084
FOLKS ARE COMING OUT OF THE 

300
00:11:59,084 --> 00:11:59,384

THERE. 

304
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,256
THEY ARE RECESSING APPARENTLY 

305
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:12,231
TO HEAR THE ARGUMENTS ON BAIL. 

306
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:12,998
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT 

307
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,099
IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE 

308
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:14,867
JUDGE DENIED THE REQUEST FOR 

309
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:15,234
BAIL. 

310
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:19,705
THAT WOULD MEAN THAT BILL COSBY 

311
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:20,272
COULD PRESUMABLY SPEND THE 

312
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,774
NIGHT AND THE REST OF THE NEXT 

313
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:22,708
FEW NIGHTS AND YEARS IN PRISON. 

314
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,210
SO WE ARE WAITING TO FIND OUT 

315
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,311
IF THAT WILL REMAIN THE CASE. 

316
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,411
THE BAIL IS DENIED. 

317
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:34,720
WHAT THAT ULTIMATELY MEANS IN 

318
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,755
TERMS OF HIM BEING REMANDED 

319
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,789

00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,368
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

326
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:50,870
IF YOU CAN HANG OUT FOR US FOR 

327
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,203
A SECOND. 

328
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,504
I WANT TO BRING IN RICKY 

329
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:53,539
KLEEMAN THAT IS JOINING ME ON 

330
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:53,839
THE SET. 

331
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,140
I WENT TO PICK UP THE LAST 

332
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,845
POINT THAT EUREKA HAD ABOUT THE 

333
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:00,045
BAIL. 

334
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:00,946
ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THAT? 

335
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:01,880
>> NOT WITH THE JUDGE. 

336
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,015
THE JUDGE HAS BEEN STRICT IN 

337
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:03,382
THIS CASE. 

338
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,717
IT IS CLEAR HOW HE FEELS ABOUT 

339
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,150
THIS DEFENDANT. 

340
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:11,357
HE HAS DEALT WITH THIS 

341
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,424
DEFENDANT AND HIS MARIETTA OF 

342
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,425
LAWYERS FOR TWO TRIALS AND A 

343
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,527
SLEW OF MOTIONS AND THE JUDGE 

344
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,561
WAS READY TO SAY ENOUGH IS 

345
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:15,961
ENOUGH.  

346
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,361
SO NO. 

347
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:26,272
IT DOES NOT SURPRISE ME. 

348
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,773
AT THE SAME TIME, WE CANNOT, IF 

349
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:28,907
WE LOOK AT IT FROM A LAWYER'S 

350
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:30,108
POINT OF VIEW AS OPPOSED TO 

351
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:31,510
FROM A WOMAN'S POINT OF VIEW -- 

352
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,545
AS A LAWYER, I SAY THIS. 

353
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,412
THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL ISSUES 

354
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:33,812
HERE FOR APPEAL. 

355
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,080
THIS IS NOT A FRIVOLOUS APPEAL. 

356
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,215
THERE ARE ISSUES THAT GO ALL 

357
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,416
THE WAY BACK TO THE FACT THAT, 

358
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,450
WHEN YOU FIRST DEAL WITH THAT 

359
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,352
BILL COSBY AND HE ENTERED INTO 

360
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:45,090
THE CIVIL LITIGATION, WAY BACK, 

361
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,958
THAT HE EVENTUALLY SETTLED FOR 

362
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:46,892
$3.4 MILLION WITH ANDREA 

363
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,027
CONSTANT, THAT HE TESTIFIED 

364
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:57,469
WITHOUT FEAR OF HIS TESTIMONY 

365
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:58,904
WITH THE BELIEF THAT HE SAYS HE 

366
00:13:58,904 --> 00:13:59,838
HAD A PROMISE FROM THE PREVIOUS 

367
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:00,940
GA THAT HE WOULD NOT BE 

368
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,340
PROSECUTED. 

369
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,274
HE COULD HAVE TAKEN THE FIFTH 

370
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:02,574
AMENDMENT. 

371
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:03,042
HE DID NOT. 

372
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,243
THE STATEMENTS IN THAT 

373
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,413
DEPOSITION THEN EVENTUALLY, 

374
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,280
WHEN THE DEPOSITION GOT 

375
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,114
UNSEALED, SO MANY YEARS LATER, 

376
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:16,689
OPENED THE DOOR FOR THE RATHER 

377
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,323
EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER, SOMEWHERE 

378
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,189
IN THE VICINITY OF 60 WOMEN, 

379
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:19,158
THAT HAVE ACCUSED BILL COSBY 

380
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,359
AND NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE SO 

381
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,226
UNTIL THAT DEPOSITION BECAME 

382
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:21,459
PUBLIC. 

383
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,495
>> I WANT TO BE CLEAR. 

384
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,630
WHEN YOU ARE SAYING THAT HE 

385
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,731
GAVE THE DEPOSITION, DO YOU 

386
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:26,665
BELIEVE THAT THE ATTORNEYS HAVE 

387
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:39,478
SOLID LEGAL FOOTING TO COME BACK

388
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,145
AND APPEAL THIS? 

389
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,180
>> THEY HAVE GROUNDS FOR 

390
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:41,413
APPEAL. 

391
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,414
WHETHER OR NOT THE CASE IS 

392
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,616
ULTIMATELY REVERSED IS UP TO AN 

393
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,817
APPELLATE COURT BUT THIS IS NOT 

394
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:45,784
JUST LAWYERS SAYING WE ARE 

395
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:46,184
GOING TO APPEAL. 

396
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:47,286
HE HAS ISSUE AFTER ISSUE AFTER 

397
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,287
ISSUE WITH THIS CASE.  

398
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,521
I WANT TO BRING IN JERICKA 

399
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,522
DUNCAN THAT HAS NEW DETAILS TO 

400
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:50,823
REPORT. 

401
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:51,957
>> Reporter:  I AM JUST HEARING 

402
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:52,891
FROM SOMEBODY INSIDE THAT THE 

403
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:53,826
JUDGE SAYS THAT THE COURT 

404
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,160
DENIED BAIL, PENDING AN APPEAL, 

405
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,595
BUT WILL CONSIDER ARGUMENTS 

406
00:14:56,595 --> 00:15:00,132
FROM THE DEFENSE AND A MEMO 

407
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,066
PRESENTED TO HIM FROM THE 

408
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,335
COMMONWEALTH IN HIS DECISION. 

409
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,603
SO WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SENSE 

410
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,806
OF ALL OF THAT. 

411
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:08,908
I WILL LEAVE IT TO YOU. 

412
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,176
TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT 

413
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:11,810
MEANS. 

414
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,778
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY, 

415
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:13,979
PENDING AN APPEAL? 

416
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:20,452
>> DURING THE APPELLATE 

417
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:21,420
PROCESS, WHICH COULD TAKE A 

418
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,320
COUPLE OF YEARS, THE QUESTION 

419
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,555
IS, IS BILL COSBY GOING TO 

420
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,023
SPEND THOSE COUPLE OF YEARS IN 

421
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:29,528
PRISON AND, WITH A CHANCE THAT 

422
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,796
THE CASE COULD BE REVERSED ON 

423
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:31,830
APPEAL, IN WHICH CASE HE WOULD 

424
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,432
NOT HAVE HAD TO DO A DAY SO IN 

425
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:41,473
LIGHT OF HIS AGE, AND WHAT 

426
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,374
CLEARLY APPEARS THAT HE IS NOT 

427
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,776
A FLIGHT RISK AND HE HAS BEEN 

428
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,643
HERE THROUGH ALL OF THESE 

429
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:45,577
YEARS, WHAT THE DEFENSE IS 

430
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:46,512
SAYING IS, JUDGE, WAIT A 

431
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:46,745
MINUTE. 

432
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,480
WE HAVE ALL OF THESE ISSUES FOR 

433
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,882
APPEAL. IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT 

434
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:50,449
WE ULTIMATELY WIN. 

435
00:15:50,449 --> 00:16:02,528
BUT THEY DO HAVE MERIT. 

436
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,261
THE COMMONWEALTH, THE 

437
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:03,995
PROSECUTION, IS SAYING, NONE OF 

438
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:04,830
THESE ISSUES ULTIMATELY HAVE 

439
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,063
MERIT. 

440
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:05,864
THEY HAVE BEEN FULLY LITIGATED, 

441
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,366
AND THE CASE IS NOT GOING TO BE 

442
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:07,633
REVERSED. 

443
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,635
SO IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO FACE 

444
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:18,477
THE PIPER. 

445
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,711
SO WHAT IS YOUR SENSE BUT I 

446
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,279
KNOW THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A 

447
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,147
CRYSTAL BALL BUT THE WAY THAT 

448
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,082
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM WORKS, HE 

449
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,383
IS 81 AND HE HAS CITED HIS 

450
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,316
EYESIGHT AS BEING AN ISSUE, 

451
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:25,884
HEALTH ISSUES. 

452
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:26,818
WHERE DO YOU SEE THIS GOING? 

453
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:27,786
WILL HE ULTIMATELY SERVE TIME 

454
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:28,153
IN PRISON? 

455
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:28,921
>> WELL, ULTIMATELY, YES. 

456
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,022
WHETHER THAT IS TODAY  OR 

457
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,156
WHETHER THAT MAY BE YEARS FROM 

458
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,458
NOW,  ONE BELIEVES THAT HE IS 

459
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,592
GOING TO SERVE SOME OF THIS 

460
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:39,431
TIME IN PRISON, AND THIS JUDGE 

461
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,833
-- I CANNOT SEE THIS JUDGE 

462
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,266
REVERSING HIMSELF. 

463
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,034
I THINK THAT THIS JUDGE IS 

464
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:51,009
GOING TO SEND HIM NOW. 

465
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,144
AND IT WOULD BE UP TO AN 

466
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,078
APPELLATE COURT TO SAY, OKAY, 

467
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:53,846
WAIT A MINUTE. 

468
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,379
HE IS 81. 

469
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,313
HE MIGHT DIE BEFORE THE APPEAL 

470
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:55,981
IS EVER DECIDED. 

471
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,216
AND SO, WE SHOULD SEND HIM 

472
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:57,416
HOME. 

473
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,383
THE COMMONWEALTH, THE 

474
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:01,887
GOVERNMENT, HAS THE RIGHT TO 

475
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:02,721
SAY, LOOK, WE HAVE FACILITIES 

476
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:03,956
THAT DEAL WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE 

477
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:04,156
OLD. 

478
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,958
WE HAVE FACILITIES THAT DEAL 

479
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:12,431
WITH PEOPLE WITH HEALTH, 

480
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:13,165
INCLUDING THE ISSUE OF HIS 

481
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:13,464
BLINDNESS. 

482
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:14,665
THAT DOES NOT PASS HIM FROM 

483
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:14,866
THIS. 

484
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:15,800
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS A 

485
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,869
VERDICT FOR THE ME, TOO 

486
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:18,137
MOVEMENT? 

487
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:18,770
>> HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT. 

488
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,704
IT IS THE VERY FIRST CRIMINAL 

489
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:20,638
VERDICT OF GUILTY AND NOW 

490
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:21,940
SENTENCED TO PRISON THAT HAS 

491
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,642
HAPPENED IN THIS COUNTRY. 

492
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:33,418
KEEP THIS IN MIND AS WELL. WE 

493
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:34,720
HAVE HAD TWO TRIALS OF BILL 

494
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:34,953
COSBY. 

495
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:35,821
TRIAL NUMBER ONE WHICH ENDED IN 

496
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,322
A HUNG JURY IN THE SUMMER OF 

497
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,257
2017 WAS A TRIAL THAT CAME 

498
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:45,898
BEFORE THE ONSLAUGHT OF ROGERS, 

499
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,099
RILEY, AS THE DOMINOES FELL TO 

500
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:47,733
HARVEY WEINSTEIN WHICH CLEARLY 

501
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:53,539
LED TO THE UN-BURDENING OF THE 

502
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:53,939
ME, TOO MOVEMENT. 

503
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:54,773
BILL COSBY THEN DOES TRIAL 

504
00:17:54,773 --> 00:18:05,083
NUMBER TWO IN APRIL OF 2018, 

505
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,018
ALMOST A YEAR LATER, AT THE 

506
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,319
HEIGHT OF THE ME, TOO MOVEMENT. 

507
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,086
TIMING IS EVERYTHING IN LIFE. 

508
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:09,388
IF BILL COSBY HAD GONE TO TRIAL 

509
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,923
THE SECOND TIME BETWEEN JUNE 

510
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:18,096
AND OCTOBER OF 2017, IT IS 

511
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,364
POSSIBLE THEY -- I AM NOT 

512
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,299
SAYING THAT IT IS PROBABLE -- 

513
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,433
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU MIGHT 

514
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,702
HAVE HAD ANOTHER HUNG JURY.  

515
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:24,803
AND EVEN, LOOKING AT THE HUNG 

516
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:28,407
JURY THAT IT WAS CERTAINLY SAID 

517
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:28,974
THAT THERE WERE ENOUGH 

518
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:29,841
ACQUITTAL VOTES IN THAT HUNG 

519
00:18:29,841 --> 00:18:38,550
JURY, I SUPPOSE IT IS -- IT IS 

520
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,384
POSSIBLE THAT HE COULD HAVE 

521
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:39,784
BEEN ACQUITTED. 

522
00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:40,719
ONCE THE ME, TOO MOVEMENT 

523
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:41,720
STARTED, THERE WAS A WHOLE 

524
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,788
SHIFT IN HOW WE REGARD THE 

525
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,155
ALLEGATIONS OF ONE WOMAN, LET 

526
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:46,325
ALONE A WOMAN THAT IS THEN 

527
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,492
BOLSTERED, IN THIS CASE, BY 

528
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:58,337
FIVE OTHER ACCUSERS. 

529
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,471
SO IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF 

530
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,572
THE ME, TOO MOVEMENT, AND IT 

531
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,506
WILL BE A WATERSHED MOMENT. 

532
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:02,908
I WANT TO GO BACK TO JERICKA 

533
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:03,141
DUNCAN. 

534
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:04,243
WHAT IS THE REACTION FOR SOME 

535
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,543
OF THESE ACCUSERS THAT ARE IN 

536
00:19:05,543 --> 00:19:06,010
THE COURTROOM TODAY? 

537
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,945
>> Reporter: AGAIN, WHAT WE 

538
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:07,913
WERE HEARING IS THAT MANY OF 

539
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:08,947
THEM, AGAIN, NOT NECESSARILY  

540
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,249
PART OF WHAT GOT BILL COSBY THE 

541
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,116
CONVICTION BUT THE ONES THAT 

542
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:21,860
HAVE BEEN HERE THROUGHOUT, THE 

543
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,794
FIRST, THE SECOND TRIALS AND 

544
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:23,695
SOME FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY 

545
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:24,630
THAT CAME AND SUPPORTED ANDREA 

546
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,731
COSTAND AND SOME WHO HAVE SAID 

547
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,665
THAT BILL COSBY SEXUALLY 

548
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,432
ASSAULTED THEM AS WELL, WERE 

549
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,433
ARM IN ARM, APPARENTLY, WHEN 

550
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:32,471
THE SENTENCE WAS READ. 

551
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,572
SOME OF THEM WERE SOBBING AT 

552
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,139
TIMES, VERY EMOTIONAL. 

553
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,641
THE JUDGE SAID AT ONE POINT A 

554
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:36,575
JURY VERDICT MUST BE HEARD LOUD 

555
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,277
AND CLEAR, KIND OF GOING BACK 

556
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,647
TO WHAT SHE MENTIONED ABOUT HER 

557
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:42,581
NOT SEEING THE JUDGE REVERSING 

558
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,515
THE DECISION AND REFERENCE TO 

559
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:43,882
THIS APPEAL. 

560
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:50,088
WE SEE A FEW ACCUSERS THAT HAVE 

561
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:50,622
COME OUT. 

562
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,690
ONE WOMAN, YOU CANNOT SEE HER 

563
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,691
-- SHE ACTUALLY TESTIFIED IN 

564
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,124
THE SECOND TRIAL. 

565
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:54,793
I JUST SAW JANICE DICKINSON WHO 

566
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:59,297
ALSO TESTIFIED IN THE SECOND 

567
00:19:59,297 --> 00:19:59,531
TRIAL. 

568
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,632
I THINK THAT SHE MIGHT BE 

569
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:01,399
TALKING TO OUR AFFILIATE. 

570
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:11,443
WE ARE WAITING. THERE IS A 

571
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:11,676
RECESS. 

572
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:12,778
I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE SOME 

573
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:13,145
PEOPLE INSIDE. 

574
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,079
WE ARE GETTING NOTES FROM THEM. 

575
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,380
WE ARE WAITING TO GET ANY 

576
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:15,647
UPDATES. 

577
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:16,615
AGAIN, THIS IS A GOOD DAY 

578
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,716
WITHOUT A DOUBT FOR ANDREA 

579
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,151
COSTAND BECAUSE SHE SAW THIS 

580
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:27,225
THING 30. 

581
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,327
I EVEN REMEMBER IN THAT FIRST 

582
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,461
TRIAL, EVEN THOUGH IT DID NOT 

583
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,696
END THE WAY THAT SHE WANTED, I 

584
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:31,563
REMEMBER HER POSTING A SHORT 

585
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,231
VIDEO ON TWITTER, WHERE SHE IS 

586
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:42,040
PLAYING BASKETBALL AND SHE SAYS 

587
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,774
SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF 

588
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:43,341
ALWAYS FOLLOW THROUGH. 

589
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:44,643
WE KNOW THAT SHE IS A FORMER 

590
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:45,410
BASKETBALL PLAYER AND SHE 

591
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,511
ACTUALLY MET BILL COSBY WHEN 

592
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,379
SHE WAS WORKING AT TEMPLE 

593
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,947
UNIVERSITY AS THE OPERATIONS 

594
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:49,214
MANAGER. 

595
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,082
IT SPEAKS TO HER COMMITMENT TO 

596
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:50,849
SEEING THIS CASE THROUGH. 

597
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:51,783
HERE SHE WAS, SOMEBODY THAT 

598
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,085
WENT TO THE POLICE IN 2005, AND 

599
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,219
THE CASE WAS PRETTY MUCH CLOSED 

600
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,887
AFTER TWO WEEKS OF LOOKING INTO 

601
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,355
IT UNDER A DIFFERENT DISTRICT 

602
00:20:57,355 --> 00:21:03,028
ATTORNEY. 

603
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:03,828
THE NEW EVIDENCE, INFORMATION, 

604
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:04,463
CAME FORWARD FROM THE 

605
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,297
DEPOSITIONS, FROM A CIVIL 

606
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,064
LAWSUIT, AND THAT IS WHAT 

607
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:06,798
PROMPTED THIS DISTRICT 

608
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,133
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO TRY AND 

609
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:19,711
FIGURE OUT IF THEY HAD ENOUGH 

610
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:20,311
INFORMATION AND EVIDENCE TO 

611
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:21,580
PURSUE A CASE AND COME IN THAT 

612
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,514
CASE, THEY DECIDED THAT 

613
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:23,281
AGGRAVATED INDECENT ASSAULT WAS 

614
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:24,116
WHAT THEY COULD CHARGE BILL 

615
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,051
COSBY AND WHAT THEY BELIEVE THE 

616
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:32,090
EMAIL -- THREE YEARS AGO THAT 

617
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,292
THEY COULD GET A CONVICTION ON. 

618
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,526
AGAIN, I KNOW IN THE VERY 

619
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,093
BEGINNING, PEOPLE ARE JUST 

620
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:35,660
TUNING IN. 

621
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,995
WE WANT TO GO BACK TO SOME OF 

622
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:37,929
THE THINGS THAT ANDREA COSTAND 

623
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,064
SAID IN HER VICTIM IMPACT 

624
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:39,364
STATEMENT. 

625
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:52,344
I OFTEN ASK MYSELF WHY THE 

626
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,378
BURDEN OF BEING THE SOLE 

627
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,212
WITNESS IN TWO CRIMINAL TRIALS 

628
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,213
HAD TO FALL ON ME. 

629
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:55,880
THE PRESSURE WAS ENORMOUS. 

630
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,815
I HAD TO TESTIFY. 

631
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,949
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. 

632
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:58,884
SO AGAIN, THIS SPEAKS TO 

633
00:21:58,884 --> 00:21:59,918
SOMEBODY THAT HAS TALKED ABOUT 

634
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:00,952
HAVING A REALLY TOUGH TIME WITH 

635
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:01,219
THIS. 

636
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:01,919
HER MOTHER TESTIFIED YESTERDAY. 

637
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:02,854
WITH A VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT. 

638
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:03,855
HER FATHER AND HER OLDER 

639
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:04,088
SISTER. 

640
00:22:04,088 --> 00:22:04,890
REALLY, THEY BASICALLY TALK 

641
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,824
ABOUT HOW THIS HAS CHANGED HER 

642
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,191
WHOLE LIFE. 

643
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:17,869
SHE DOES NOT REALLY HAVE CLOSE 

644
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:18,402
FRIENDS, SO TO SPEAK. 

645
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:19,337
SHE ONLY TRUST HER FAMILY. 

646
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:20,539
SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW THIS HAS 

647
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,406
CREATED TRUST ISSUES FOR HER, 

648
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:22,140
EVEN AS AN ADULT. 

649
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,074
WE ARE INTERESTED IN HEARING 

650
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:23,442
FROM HER. 

651
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,243
WE ARE NOT SURE IF SHE WILL BE 

652
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:25,843
MAKING ANY STATEMENTS LATER. 

653
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:38,290
SHE DID NOT AFTER THE SECOND 

654
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,191
TRIAL, WHICH WAS THE 

655
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,125
CONVICTION, BUT WE IMAGINE THAT 

656
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:40,892
MAYBE SHE MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE 

657
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,027
SOMETHING TO SAY TO THE GENERAL 

658
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:42,794
PUBLIC, TO THE MEDIA. 

659
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:43,995
SHE OBVIOUSLY SAID THANK YOU TO 

660
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,230
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE VICTIM 

661
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:45,997
IMPACT STATEMENT FROM THE 

662
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:46,932
DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO THE TWO 

663
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,066
PROSECUTORS WHO ALSO WERE VERY 

664
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:48,599
DILIGENT ABOUT GETTING A 

665
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:48,900
CONVICTION. 

666
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,101
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 

667
00:22:50,101 --> 00:22:50,301
THAT. 

668
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:51,436
THE BURDEN OF BEING THE SOLE 

669
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:52,337
WITNESS AS SHE HAD TALKED 

670
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:52,604
ABOUT. 

671
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:57,342
PART OF THE ISSUE THAT I HEARD 

672
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:07,152
TEST -- HER TESTIMONY WAS VALUE 

673
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,086
BECAUSE OF THE STATUTE OF 

674
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:08,419
LIMITATIONS. 

675
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:09,221
THERE ARE FIVE DECADES OF OVER 

676
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,155
60 PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD, 

677
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:10,789
ACCUSING BILL COSBY. 

678
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:11,923
DO YOU EVER SEE THAT LAW 

679
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:12,189
CHANGING? 

680
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:13,124
SO MANY WOMEN THAT HAVE FACED 

681
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:14,092
SEXUAL ASSAULT HAVE NOT BEEN 

682
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,393
ABLE TO COME FOR BECAUSE OF THE 

683
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,328
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS EXPIRED. 

684
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,294
IS THAT EVER GOING TO CHANGE? 

685
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:18,130
>> IT IS, STATE-BY-STATE, 

686
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:18,630
LITTLE BY LITTLE. 

687
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,298
IT IS NOT ONLY A RESULT OF THE 

688
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,066
ME, TOO MOVEMENT BECAUSE WE 

689
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,001
REALIZE, AS A SOCIETY THAT WOMEN

690
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:26,371
DO NOT COME FORWARD IN 80% OF 

691
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:38,650
THE CASES OR MORE AT THE TIME 

692
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,451
THAT THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE OF 

693
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,419
FEAR, BECAUSE OF SHAME, BECAUSE 

694
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,253
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 

695
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:41,586
RETALIATION. 

696
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,754
WHAT WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED -- WE 

697
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,321
ARE IN PENNSYLVANIA. 

698
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,255
WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE PREDATORY 

699
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:44,823
PRIEST CASES. 

700
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:45,623
YOU HAVE COME IN PENNSYLVANIA, 

701
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:47,359
HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS -- 

702
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,793
HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN THAT 

703
00:23:48,793 --> 00:23:58,003
BECAME A PART, AS ADULTS, OF A 

704
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:58,436
GRAND JURY REPORT. 

705
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,104
ALTHOUGH THE STATUTE OF 

706
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,005
LIMITATIONS EXPIRED, THERE WAS 

707
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:00,639
CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE BECAUSE 

708
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,540
THE CHURCH HAD KEPT RECORDS OF 

709
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,974
THIS ABUSE AND MOVING PEOPLE 

710
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:09,848
AROUND. 

711
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:10,681
SO THIS IS HAPPENING STATE-BY-

712
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:10,915
STATE. 

713
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:11,917
WE HAVE SEEN IT HAPPENING IN 

714
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:12,217
CALIFORNIA. 

715
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:13,351
WE HAVE SEEN IT HAPPENING IN 

716
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,452
NEW YORK WERE THE STATUTE OF 

717
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,019
LIMITATIONS IS GOING AWAY. 

718
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:16,187
I THINK THAT IT IS PARTICULARLY 

719
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:17,455
VALUABLE, NOT ONLY IN THE CASE 

720
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:24,629
OF WOMEN AND PERHAPS MEN THAT 

721
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,564
HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF SEXUAL 

722
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,032
ASSAULT BUT FOR THE WORK THAT I 

723
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,066
HAVE DONE IT WORKING AT THE 

724
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,000
RAPE TREATMENT CENTER WHEN I 

725
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,134
WAS LIVING IN LOS ANGELES, IT 

726
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:30,802
IS CRITICAL FOR CHILDREN. 

727
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,903
IT IS JUST CRITICAL THAT WHAT 

728
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:40,979
HAPPENS AS A CHILD REACHES THE 

729
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,013
AGE OF 18 AND THEN THE STATUTE 

730
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,215
WAS ALWAYS TOLD UNTIL THEN BUT 

731
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,082
THEN IT RAN FAST. 

732
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,016
SO IF SOMEBODY KNOWS THAT THEY 

733
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,051
WERE ABUSED AS A CHILD, 

734
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,385
PERHAPS, REPEATEDLY BY A 

735
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:54,759
TRUSTED INDIVIDUAL, BY A LOVED 

736
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:55,894
ONE, LET ALONE A STRANGER AND 

737
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,329
THEY REACH THE AGE OF 18 AND 

738
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,563
THEY CANNOT COME TO GRIPS WITH 

739
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,664
IT AND IT TAKES YEARS FOR THEM 

740
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,431
TO GET INTO THERAPY. 

741
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:01,733
AND THEN TO GO BACK AND TALK 

742
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:02,666
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BY PERHAPS 

743
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,002
NOT ONLY A MEMBER OF THE CLERGY 

744
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,203
OR A RELATIVE BUT A COACH. 

745
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,204
WE HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN IN THE 

746
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,740
LARRY NASSAR CASE, THIS IS 

747
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,740
UNFORTUNATELY NOT UNUSUAL. 

748
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:20,652
SO THE ENDING OF MANY OF THE 

749
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:21,786
STATUTES OF LIMITATION, IT WILL 

750
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:22,086
TAKE WORK. 

751
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:22,820
BUT STATE-BY-STATE, I PREDICT 

752
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,422
THAT EVENTUALLY THEY WILL ALL 

753
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,523
GO AWAY. 

754
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:26,458
>> WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL 

755
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:26,725
ASSAULT. 

756
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:27,859
>>> REMARKABLE TO HEAR YOU SAY 

757
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,159
THAT. 

758
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,497
WE HAVE MORE DEVELOPMENTS, 

759
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:33,064
SHAMIKA DUNCAN OUT AT 

760
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:33,998
NORRISTOWN AND WE ARE EXPECTING 

761
00:25:33,998 --> 00:25:35,300
THE 2:40 PM COURT TO TAKE UP 

762
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,434
THE ISSUE OF THE BAIL. 

763
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:37,636
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THAT LIVE 

764
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,505
AND WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE. 

765
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:41,540
YOU CAN JOIN US THROUGHOUT THE

00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,374
