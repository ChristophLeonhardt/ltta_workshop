THE CAMPAIGN THAT HE'S WORKING FOR SOME MOMENTUM ON IN CONGRESS FOR SOME MOMENTUM ON IN CONGRES CONGRESS. KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE ACTIVITY OVER AT THE WHITE HOUSE THIS EVENING. IN THE MEANTIME, BY PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE AGREEING WITH THE PRESIDENT TELLING ME EARLIER THAT IT'S TIME FOR ROBERT MUELLER TO WRAP UP THIS PROBE. I JUST THINK FOR THE SAKE OF THE COUNTRY, AND I THINK IT'S TIME THAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WRAP IT UP AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY AN OPINION WIDELY SHARED BY PEOPLE ALL ACROSS AMERICA. Martha: HILLARY CLINTON'S FORMER TOP ADVISOR AGREES. HE WROTE A VERY FORCEFUL PIECE ON THIS TODAY. JOINING ME NOW MARK PENN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL POLLSTER AND ADVISOR TO BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON. AND TEXAS CONGRESSMAN JOHN RATCLIFFE, A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, VERY INVOLVED IN THIS INVESTIGATION AS WELL. GENTLEMEN, GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT. THANKS FOR BEING APPEAR ON THE ROOFTOP WITH US. HE WROTE TODAY THAT THE DEEP STATE IS IN A DEEP STATE OF DESPERATION, WHAT DID YOU MEAN? I THINK THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT IS COMING OUT. I THINK DEVIN NUNES IS FINDING OUT WHAT WERE THE ORIGINS OF THE INVESTIGATION. AND THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A REAL CONCRETE INTELLIGENCE ORIGIN FOR THIS INVESTIGATION AND WITHOUT A FOUNDATION, ONE WONDERS WHAT DID WE SPEND AN ENTIRE YEAR ON? WHAT DID WE DISRUPT EVERYONE WHO WAS IN THE CAMPAIGN, EVERYONE WHO WAS IN THE ADMINISTRATION, AND I'VE SEEN I SPENT A YEAR FIGHTING THIS THING WITH KEN STARR AND I THINK THIS THING IS JUST PLAIN WRONG THAT HAS GOT TO BE ENDED AT STOPPED. Martha: THE REACTION THIS MORNING ON A LOT OF CHANNELS TO THE REPORT THAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT HAPPENED DURING HIS CAMPAIGN AND WHO MAY HAVE BEEN INFILTRATING HIS CAMPAIGN PERHAPS TO ENSNARE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE CAMPAIGN. THE WORDS THAT WERE USED THIS MORNING, AND ABUSE OF POWER, ERIC HOLDER SAYS THIS INQUIRY IS DANGEROUS AND THREATENING. I DON'T SEE IT IS DANGEROUS AND THREATENING. I THINK IT APPEARS THE FBI RAN SOME STING OPERATIONS. WE REALLY SEE AND HEAR PEOPLE INDICTED FOR UNRELATED CHARGES IN ORDER TO FLIP ON THE PRESIDENT. WE FOUND PEOPLE'S LIVES BEING TOTALLY DISRUPTED AND RUINED IN ORDER TO GET THE OBJECTIVE OF GET THE PRESIDENT. WE GET THE PRESIDENT THROUGH ELECTIONS. AND IF WE DON'T GET BACK TO WINNING OUR BATTLES ON ISSUES, DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, IT'S 1998 ALL OVER AGAIN AND THAT THE PATTERN WE'VE SEEN. WE'VE SEEN THE LESS THEY COME UP WITH THE MORE THEY INVESTIGATE INSTEAD OF THE OPPOSITE. Martha: THESE FOLKS ARE VERY UNSETTLED BY THIS WHOLE THING. JOHN BRENNAN TWEETED THIS TODAY. LET'S PUT IT UP ON THE SCREEN AND SHOW EVERYBODY AT HOME. HE THINKS THAT THIS IS AN OUTRAGE, WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE. THERE IT IS. McCONNELL AND SPEAKER RYAN, IF MR. TRUMP CONTINUES ALONG THIS DISASTROUS PATH YOU WILL BEAR MAJOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE HARM DONE TO OUR DEMOCRACY. IF YOU CONTINUE TO ENABLE MR. TRUMP'S SELF-SERVING ACTIONS. JOHN BRENNAN HAS BEEN ON A TEAR UNLESS FOR SOME TIME. HERE'S JAMES CLAPPER. SO IF THERE WAS SOMEONE THAT WAS OBSERVING THAT SORT OF THING, THAT'S A GOOD THING. Martha: TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THE CAMPAIGN. BRENNAN AND KLAPPER AND COMEY. THEY ALL HAVE A LOT AT STAKE HERE. THEIR DECISIONS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE BEING LOOKED AT. THE ACTIONS THAT THEY TOOK ARE REALLY AT THE BASIS OF WHAT THE CHAIRMAN ARE TRYING TO GET THESE DOCUMENTS RELATING TO, HOW DID THIS INFILTRATION OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN OR FOLKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CAMPAIGN BEGAN? AGAIN, NOT THE IDENTITY OF THE INFORMANT, BUT THE PREDICATE DOCUMENTS, THE FBI 302S AND THE 1023S THAT WILL ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS AN APPROPRIATE PURPOSE BEHIND THIS AS OPPOSED TO AN INAPPROPRIATE POLITICAL PURPOSE. Martha: THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW CIRCULAR THIS WHOLE THING WAS. DID THEY HAVE SOMEONE, AND INFORMANT, BECAUSE THEY HAD EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON? OR DID THEY HAVE THE INFORMANT BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO BAIT PEOPLE INTO DOING SOMETHING WRONG? RIGHT. THAT'S ULTIMATELY THE QUESTION, THESE ARE FAIR QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO GET THE ANSWER TO THAT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THOSE ANSWERS ARE IN CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVEN'T SEEN. APPARENTLY SOME MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA HAD SEEN THEM AND IT RAISES QUESTION IN AND OF ITSELF. BUT WE GOT TO KEEP PRESSING ON THIS. MARK RAISES FAIR POINTS. WE'VE SEEN UNPRECEDENTED ACTIONS TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH POLITICAL CANDIDATES AND CAMPAIGNS AND FOR THE COMMUNITY AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY. THESE ARE FAIR QUESTIONS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT. Martha: THIS IS A 400 PAGE DOCUMENT. THERE IS A LOT IN THERE AND A LOT OF FOLKS ARE SWEATING IT OUT LOT OF FOLKS ARE SWEATING IT OU OUT. THAT'S WHY I SAID THE DEEP STATE IS IN A DEEP STATE OF DESPERATION. IF THIS REPORT IS REALLY CRITICAL OF COMEY AND OTHERS IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IT WILL OPEN A FLOODGATE AGAINST THEM. AND IF YOU GO BACK AND READ THE McCABE REPORT, YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYONE DOCUMENT TICK TOCK, MINUTE-BY-MINUTE AS THIS GUY HORWITZ DOES. AND I THINK COMEY WILL BE KNOCKED OUT AS A WITNESS AND A LOT OF OTHER QUESTIONS WILL GET ASKED. Martha: 400 PAGES, YOU THINK IT'S ABOUT A WEEK OUT? ABOUT A WEEK OUT. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OF THE FBI HAVE A DRAFT COPY OF IT. IT'S BEING REVIEWED FOR CLASSIFIED MATERIAL. OTHER INFORMATION MAY BE INCORRECT. I ASSUME WE WILL SEE IT IN ABOUT A WEEK. AS MARK SAID, 400 PAGES, IT DOESN'T TAKE 400 PAGES IF
