00:00:00,824 --> 00:00:01,992
NOW THREE SIGNATURES SHORT.

2
00:00:01,992 --> 00:00:03,026
KRISTIN FISHER JOINS US NOW LIVE

3
00:00:03,026 --> 00:00:04,228
ON CAPITOL HILL WITH THE BACK

4
00:00:04,228 --> 00:00:05,062
STORY HERE TONIGHT.

5
00:00:05,062 --> 00:00:07,664
HI, KRISTIN.

6
00:00:07,664 --> 00:00:09,233
>> HEY, MARTHA.

7
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:10,601
REPUBLICANS WHO JUST LEFT AN

8
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:13,003
HOUR LONG MEETING IN RYAN'S

9
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:15,005
OFFICE SAFE THEY ARE MAKING GOOD

10
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:15,405
PROGRESS.

11
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:16,106
SAY THEY ARE OPTIMISTIC THEY

12
00:00:16,106 --> 00:00:18,208
WILL BE ABLE TO FIND A PATH

13
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,810
FORWARD TO AVOID THIS DISCHARGE

14
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:20,711
PETITION, BUT AS OF NOW, THERE

15
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:23,380
IS STILL NO DEAL AND THE TIME IS

16
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:23,914
REALLY RUNNING OUT.

17
00:00:23,914 --> 00:00:28,619
A DISCHARGE PETITION IS A FAIRLY

18
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:29,253
OBSCURE, RELATIVELY RARE

19
00:00:29,253 --> 00:00:31,789
LEGISLATIVE MANEUVER.

20
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:34,324
PUT FORWARD BY ABOUT TWO DOZEN

21
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:36,260
MODERATE REPUBLICANS, MODERATE

22
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,395
REPUBLICANS LIKE CONGRESSMAN

23
00:00:38,395 --> 00:00:39,096
CARLOS CABELLO AND JEFF DENHAM

24
00:00:39,096 --> 00:00:42,099
FOR TRYING TO WANT TO FIND A

25
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:43,367
PERMANENT FIX FOR THE DREAMERS

26
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:43,834
NOW.

27
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:45,803
THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO WAIT

28
00:00:45,803 --> 00:00:46,804
FOR A BIG COMPREHENSIVE

29
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:47,638
IMMIGRATION BILL.

30
00:00:47,638 --> 00:00:49,406
THAT'S ONE SIDE.

31
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:51,608
THEN YOU HAVE CONSERVATIVES AND

32
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:52,176
THE HOUSE LEADERSHIP.

33
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:54,278
HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN AND

34
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:54,945
MAJORITY WHIP STEVE SCALISE.

35
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:55,779
THEY DO NOT WANT A VOTE ON DACA

36
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:58,015
BECAUSE THEY SAY THE BILL DOES

37
00:00:58,015 --> 00:00:59,616
NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN ENFORCEMENT

38
00:00:59,616 --> 00:01:00,317
MEASURES THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

39
00:01:00,317 --> 00:01:01,819
WANTS TO SECURE THE BORDER.

40
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:03,020
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE

41
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,221
DEVASTATING AT SOMETHING LIKE

42
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:06,423
THE DREAM ACT PASSED BECAUSE

43
00:01:06,423 --> 00:01:08,025
NUMBER ONE IT ACTUALLY THREATENS

44
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:08,525
NATIONAL SECURITY.

45
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:09,960
IT DOES NOT SECURE THE BORDER.

46
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,564
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS GET A REAL

47
00:01:13,564 --> 00:01:15,432
AGREEMENT THAT SECURES THE

48
00:01:15,432 --> 00:01:17,067
BORDER.

49
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:17,868
>> IF THESE RENEGADE MODERATE

50
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:19,903
REPUBLICANS ARE ABLE TO GET THE

51
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:21,071
218 SIGNATURES THAT THEY NEED

52
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:21,939
AND RIGHT NOW THEY ARE ONLY

53
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:23,674
THREE SIGNATURES SHORT, IF THEY

54
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:26,210
ARE ABLE TO DO THAT IT WOULD

55
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,412
FORCE A VOTE ON DACA AS EARLY AS

56
00:01:28,412 --> 00:01:28,779
JUNE 25TH.

57
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:31,048
IT WOULD ALSO COME AS YOU SAID,

58
00:01:31,048 --> 00:01:33,250
IT WOULD BE A HUGE EMBARRASSMENT

59
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,418
FOR THE HOUSE LEADERSHIP,

60
00:01:34,418 --> 00:01:35,118
ESPECIALLY SPEAKER PAUL RYAN.

61
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,121
THE LEADERSHIP THAT HAS ARTIE

62
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:38,889
WARNED ITS MEMBERSHIP THAT ALL

63
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:41,058
OF THE INFIGHTING ON IMMIGRATION

64
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:42,593
HAS REALLY CAUSED THE PARTY ITS

65
00:01:42,593 --> 00:01:44,194
MAJORITY IN NOVEMBER BUT THESE

66
00:01:44,194 --> 00:00:00,000
MODERATES ARE ARGUING THAT THESE
