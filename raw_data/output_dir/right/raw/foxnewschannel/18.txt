1
00:00:01,956 --> 00:00:03,523
THEY FEEL THEY CAN FIND OUT MORE

2
00:00:03,524 --> 00:00:06,627
BY NOT BLOWING IT UP.

3
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:08,662
BRING IN SARAH SANDERS FROM THE

4
00:00:08,663 --> 00:00:10,197
WHITE HOUSE, OBVIOUSLY PRESS

5
00:00:10,198 --> 00:00:10,897
SECRETARY.

6
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:12,766
SARAH, YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ALL

7
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:14,601
THIS LAST NIGHT TO TODAY, FROM

8
00:00:14,602 --> 00:00:15,869
THE PRESIDENT'S RALLY AND

9
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,203
BEYOND.

10
00:00:16,204 --> 00:00:17,270
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

11
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:19,006
LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER CRITIC OF THE

12
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:21,842
PRESIDENT WAS TARGETED, ROBERT

13
00:00:21,843 --> 00:00:23,977
DE NIRO, JOE BIDEN WHO MIGHT BE

14
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:24,845
RUNNING AGAINST THE PRESIDENT

15
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:26,380
AND CRITICAL OF HIM.

16
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:27,247
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?

17
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:28,949
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN MADE

18
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,517
AWARE OF THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS

19
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:31,652
THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE THIS

20
00:00:31,653 --> 00:00:31,985
MORNING.

21
00:00:31,986 --> 00:00:34,855
AS HE SAID YESTERDAY, AS HE

22
00:00:34,856 --> 00:00:36,657
CONTINUED TO SAY FROM DAY ONE OF

23
00:00:36,658 --> 00:00:38,759
TAKING OFFICE, THAT WE CONDEMN

24
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,460
VIOLENCE IN ALL FORMS.

25
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:42,629
THIS IS A DESPICABLE ACT AND

26
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,730
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT SHOULD

27
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:45,599
NEVER TAKE PLACE IN AMERICA.

28
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,000
STEVE: ABSOLUTELY.

29
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:50,737
ONE HOUR AGO THE PRESIDENT TREAT

30
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:52,005
TWEETED THIS OUT, A VERY BIG

31
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:53,707
PART OF ANGER WE SEE IN OUR

32
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,709
SOCIETY IS CAUSED BY THE

33
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,977
PURPOSEFULLY FALSE AND

34
00:00:56,978 --> 00:00:58,278
INACCURATE REPORTING THE

35
00:00:58,279 --> 00:00:59,680
MAINSTREAM MEDIA I REFER TO AS

36
00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:00,380
FAKE NEWS.

37
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:02,816
IT HAS GOTTEN SO BAD AND HATEFUL

38
00:01:02,817 --> 00:01:04,384
IT IS BEYOND DESCRIPTION.

39
00:01:04,385 --> 00:01:06,920
MAINSTREAM MEDIA MUST CLEAN UP

40
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:07,854
ITS ACT FAST.

41
00:01:07,855 --> 00:01:08,789
WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT SAYING

42
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,089
THERE?

43
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,490
>> CERTAINLY THE MEDIA HAS A

44
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:14,761
ROLE TO PLAY IN THIS PROCESS.

45
00:01:14,762 --> 00:01:16,163
WHEN 90% THE COVERAGE ABOUT THIS

46
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:17,597
PRESIDENT IS NEGATIVE, DESPITE

47
00:01:17,598 --> 00:01:21,702
THE HISTORIC SUCCESSES, WHEN

48
00:01:21,703 --> 00:01:25,138
IDEAS ARE PERPETUATED OF AN

49
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:26,540
CONTINUED NEGATIVITY NOT HELPFUL

50
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:27,708
FOR THE AMERICAN DISCOURSE.

51
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:28,709
CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT IS

52
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,943
CALLING ON EVERYONE TO COME

53
00:01:29,944 --> 00:01:30,310
TOGETHER.

54
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:31,812
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ONE

55
00:01:31,813 --> 00:01:33,513
ANOTHER, LET'S VOICE THAT BUT

56
00:01:33,514 --> 00:01:35,248
LET'S DO SO PEACEFULLY AND DO

57
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:36,950
THAT AT THE BALLOT BOX.

58
00:01:36,951 --> 00:01:38,351
AINSLEY: WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO

59
00:01:38,352 --> 00:01:41,488
STEVE SCALISE WHERE HE WAS SHOT.

60
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:42,789
WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU AND

61
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,357
YOUR FAMILY IN THE RESTAURANT.

62
00:01:44,358 --> 00:01:46,193
WE HAVE MAXINE WATERS THAT IS

63
00:01:46,194 --> 00:01:48,862
CALLING FOR PEOPLE TO GET INTO

64
00:01:48,863 --> 00:01:52,299
THE FACE OF FOLKS IN THE

65
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,834
ADMINISTRATION THEY DON'T AGREE

66
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:54,134
WITH.

67
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:55,569
HILLARY CLINTON SAYS WE WON'T BE

68
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,437
CIVIL UNTIL DEMOCRATS ARE IN

69
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:57,738
POWER.

70
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:59,306
NOT JUST SAYING IT IS DEMOCRATS

71
00:01:59,307 --> 00:02:01,408
BUT IT IS ON BOTH SIDES BUT IS

72
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,243
THIS A GOOD REMINDER TO US WE

73
00:02:03,244 --> 00:02:05,679
ALL NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK?

74
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,414
WE CAN DISAGREE ABOUT POLITICS,

75
00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:09,082
BUT IS THIS PRETTY SCARY TO YOU,

76
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,650
WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE

77
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:12,786
VIOLENCE AND THREATS?

78
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:13,620
>> ABSOLUTELY.

79
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:17,057
AS THE PRESIDENT SAID YESTERDAY,

80
00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:18,225
POLITICAL VIOLENCE HAS NO PLACE

81
00:02:18,226 --> 00:02:20,460
IN OUR COUNTRY, AND IT IS

82
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:21,461
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE

83
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:25,298
WON'T TOLERATE, WE WON'T STAND

84
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:25,599
FOR.

85
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,401
WE'LL CONTINUE TO CONDEMN IT.

86
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:29,870
WE'LL PROVIDE EVERY RESOURCE

87
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:30,971
POSSIBLE THAT THE FEDERAL

88
00:02:30,972 --> 00:02:32,672
GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ONLY TO

89
00:02:32,673 --> 00:02:34,241
PREVENT AND STOP THESE TYPES OF

90
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:35,242
INCIDENTS BUT ALSO GET TO THE

91
00:02:35,243 --> 00:02:36,943
BOTTOM OF WHO IS TRULY

92
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:38,378
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

93
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:40,380
THAT IS THE PERSON WHO SENT THE

94
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:42,482
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES AND WE'RE

95
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:44,217
GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO ALL WE

96
00:02:44,218 --> 00:02:46,620
CAN TO HELP SUPPORT LAW

97
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:47,454
ENFORCEMENT, THE SECRET SERVICE,

98
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:49,489
THE FBI, TO MAKE SURE WE FIND

99
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,191
OUT DETERMINE WHO EXACTLY THAT

100
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:51,458
WAS.

101
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,160
BRIAN: SARAH, WHAT IS HOMELAND

102
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:53,994
SECURITY DOING RIGHT NOW?

103
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:56,029
FBI IS TAKING THE LEAD.

104
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,131
LOCAL POLICE FORCES ARE FANNING

105
00:02:58,132 --> 00:02:59,633
OUT WHETHER DELAWARE, NEW YORK,

106
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:01,868
LOS ANGELES OR FLORIDA, WHEREVER

107
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:04,805
CITY DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ IS

108
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:06,373
IN, SO I'M WONDER WHAT IS

109
00:03:06,374 --> 00:03:07,674
HOMELAND SECURITY'S ROLE?

110
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:08,942
>> THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY

111
00:03:08,943 --> 00:03:09,409
CAN.

112
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,812
THEY'RE WORKING WITH STATE AND

113
00:03:11,813 --> 00:03:13,780
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, WITH THE

114
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:14,781
FBI, WITH THE UNITED STATES

115
00:03:14,782 --> 00:03:16,483
SECRET SERVICE.

116
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:18,084
EVERY LEVEL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

117
00:03:18,085 --> 00:03:20,620
THAT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY, WE ARE

118
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,889
WORKING WITH THEM AND

119
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,890
COORDINATING, MAKING SURE THEY

120
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:25,192
HAVE RESOURCES NEEDED TO GET TO

121
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:26,760
THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

122
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:28,795
STEVE: SARAH, LAST NIGHT AT THE

123
00:03:28,796 --> 00:03:30,730
WISCONSIN RALLY, THE PRESIDENT

124
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:32,999
CALLED FOR A MORE CIVIL TONE.

125
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,403
THE NATION MUST STOP TREATING

126
00:03:36,404 --> 00:03:39,806
POLITICAL OPPONENTS AS MORALLY

127
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:40,540
DEFECTIVE.

128
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,242
IS THE PRESIDENT GOING FORWARD

129
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:43,476
CHANGING HIS APPROACH TO THE

130
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:44,811
RALLY AND CRITICIZING HIS

131
00:03:44,812 --> 00:03:45,212
OPPONENTS?

132
00:03:45,213 --> 00:03:46,780
>> I THINK YOU SAW THAT LAST

133
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:47,080
NIGHT.

134
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:48,081
CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT WILL

135
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:49,783
CONTINUE TO POINT OUT CONTRASTS

136
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:52,586
OF POLICY BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND

137
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:52,986
REPUBLICANS.

138
00:03:52,987 --> 00:03:54,621
PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY HAVE A CHOICE

139
00:03:54,622 --> 00:03:57,891
TO MAKE ON WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN

140
00:03:57,892 --> 00:03:59,759
AND IT COULDN'T BE CLEARER.

141
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,994
WE COULD SEE THAT HAPPEN THE

142
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:02,162
NEXT COUPLE WEEKS WHEN THE

143
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:03,029
ELECTIONS TAKE PLACE.

144
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,197
THE PRESIDENT WILL CONTINUE TO

145
00:04:04,198 --> 00:04:05,765
LAY OUT THAT CASE BUT AT THE

146
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:07,400
SAME TIME, WE'RE CONDEMNING

147
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:08,835
VIOLENCE AND CALLING ON ALL

148
00:04:08,836 --> 00:04:10,270
AMERICANS TO COME TOGETHER.

149
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:11,671
BRIAN: WHAT IS INTERESTING,

150
00:04:11,672 --> 00:04:13,373
SARAH, I THINK WE GET IT MORE

151
00:04:13,374 --> 00:04:14,941
THAN MOST, WE KNEW THE PRESIDENT

152
00:04:14,942 --> 00:04:17,944
BEFORE HE WAS PRESIDENT, AS YOU

153
00:04:17,945 --> 00:04:20,614
SEE HIM GO HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH

154
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:22,482
MARCO RUBIO AND IT GOT PERSONAL.

155
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:24,017
HE WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH TED

156
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:26,052
CRUZ AND IT WAS PERSONAL, HE

157
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:29,022
WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH

158
00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:32,592
RAND PAUL, IT GOT PERSONAL HE

159
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:34,060
HEALED THOSE FRIENDSHIPS.

160
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:35,295
DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT

161
00:04:35,296 --> 00:04:37,964
DEFINED HE IS COMPETING WITH

162
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:40,133
ISSUES NOT PEOPLE, AND IT IS NOT

163
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:41,701
PERSONAL AND HE CAN GO FURTHER

164
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:42,936
AND DEFINE THAT?

165
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:45,505
>> THE PRESIDENT DID EXACTLY

166
00:04:45,506 --> 00:04:47,908
THAT LAST NIGHT.

167
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,075
SCOTT WALKER WAS ALSO SOMEBODY

168
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:50,343
THE PRESIDENT CAMPAIGNED AGAINST

169
00:04:50,344 --> 00:04:51,344
AT ONE POINT.

170
00:04:51,345 --> 00:04:53,380
HE WAS OUT AT HIS BIGGEST

171
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:54,681
CHAMPION LAST NIGHT, LAYING OUT

172
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:56,616
THE CASE, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

173
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:57,550
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.

174
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:59,920
THERE IS A MAJOR POLITICAL

175
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:01,588
PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

176
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:02,756
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND

177
00:05:02,757 --> 00:05:05,292
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH

178
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:06,293
POINTING THOSE DIFFERENCES OUT.

179
00:05:06,294 --> 00:05:07,460
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG TAKING

180
00:05:07,461 --> 00:05:08,862
IT TO THE POINT OF VIOLENCE

181
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:10,697
WE'RE LOOKING AT, TAKING PLACE

182
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:12,265
OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS.

183
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:14,534
THE PRESIDENT HAS CONDEMNED

184
00:05:14,535 --> 00:05:15,101
THAT.

185
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:17,404
ALL OF US HAVE BUT CERTAINLY

186
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:19,205
PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE AND FRANKLY

187
00:05:19,206 --> 00:05:20,307
THE PRESIDENT'S RESPONSIBILITY

188
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:21,775
TO LAY OUT THE POLITICAL

189
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:22,642
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEMOCRATS

190
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:30,050
AND REPUBLICANS AS WE HEAD INTO

191

192
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:32,719
PRESIDENT HAS HAD A GREAT TWO

YEARS IN OFFICE, HE HAS A STORY

194
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:35,855

00:05:35,856 --> 00:05:38,291
EXPRESS THAT AND TALK ABOUT IT

196
00:05:38,292 --> 00:05:40,126
AND CONTRAST.

197
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:41,995
AINSLEY: PACKAGES WERE SENT IN

198
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:43,330
THE PAST TO REPUBLICANS.

199
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:44,965
ALL THESE IN THE PAST TWO DAYS

200
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:46,533

THERE ARE CRAZY PEOPLE OUT

206
00:05:52,506 --> 00:05:52,806
THERE.

207
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:54,774
HAS THIS CHANGED THE WAY YOU

208
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:55,608
LIVE YOUR LIFE?

209
00:05:55,609 --> 00:05:57,477
>> THANKS CHANGED THE WAY I WAS

210
00:05:57,478 --> 00:05:59,913
LIVING MY LIFE OVER THE LAST

211
00:05:59,914 --> 00:06:00,914
SEVERAL MONTHS.

212
00:06:00,915 --> 00:06:03,717
NOT FORGET AN MSNBC ANCHOR SAID

213
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:05,185
SOMEONE SHOULD RING MY NECK.

214
00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:06,586
A "WASHINGTON POST" COLUMNIST

215
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:09,856
SAID I DESERVE AD LIFETIME OF

216
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:10,256
HARRASSMENT.

217
00:06:10,257 --> 00:06:12,125
I WAS FIRST WHITE HOUSE PRESS

218
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:13,126
SECRETARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE

219
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:14,294
WHITE HOUSE HAVE TO HAVE UNITED

220
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:15,562
STATES SECRET SERVICE.

221
00:06:15,563 --> 00:06:17,097
THEY DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE

222
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:18,665
SOMEBODY SAID NASTY THINGS.

223
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,233
THEY DO THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE

224
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:21,234
CREDIBLE THREATS.

225
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:23,236
ABSOLUTELY I UNDERSTAND THIS AND

226
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:24,504
THREATS PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING

227
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:26,039
OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS.

228
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,774
I THINK IT IS DESPICABLE, I

229
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:28,775
THINK IT IS HORRIBLE.

230
00:06:28,776 --> 00:06:29,909
WHY THE PRESIDENT IS EXACTLY

231
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,446
RIGHT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:37,150
CONDEMN THIS VIOLENCE CALL IT

00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:39,285

234
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:41,287
STEVE: THE PRESIDENT CALLED FOR

235
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:42,555
A MORE CIVIL TONE.

MAILED AROUND, THAT IS THE

239
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,160
PRESIDENT'S FAULT.

240
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:49,929
>> I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY

241
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,264
DISGRACEFUL THAT ONE OF THE

242
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:53,833
FIRST PUBLIC STATEMENTS WE HEARD

243
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:56,403
FROM CNN YESTERDAY WAS TO PUT

244
00:06:56,404 --> 00:06:59,039
THE BLAME AND RESPONSIBILITY OF

245
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,373
THIS DESPICABLE ACT ON THE

246
00:07:00,374 --> 00:07:02,675
PRESIDENT AND ON ME PERSONALLY.

247
00:07:02,676 --> 00:07:04,044
WHEN THE PERSON THAT IS

248
00:07:04,045 --> 00:07:05,879
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS IS THE

249
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,314
PERSON WHO MADE AND CREATED AND

250
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:11,718
PUT THESE SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES IN

251
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:13,987
THE HANDS, IN THE ARMS OF

252
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:15,555
INNOCENT AMERICAN CITIZENS.

253
00:07:15,556 --> 00:07:16,689
THAT'S THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE.

254
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,324
I FIND THAT DISGRACEFUL THAT WAS

255
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:20,527
ONE OF THE FIRST STATEMENTS IS,

256
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:22,095
THEY MADE THIS AND TRIED TO PUT

257
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:24,130
THE BLAME ON THE PRESIDENT.

258
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:26,666
BRIAN: YOU ANSWERED JEFF ZUCKER

259
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:28,201

260
00:07:28,202 --> 00:07:29,636
HE HAS NOT RESPONDED.

261
00:07:29,637 --> 00:07:30,637
WE SEE PUBLICLY.

262
00:07:30,638 --> 00:07:32,405
WE SAW "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

263
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:32,705

264
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:35,075
THEY DO HAVE A FANTASY, A

265
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:36,776
FANTASY SCENARIO FROM FICTION

266
00:07:36,777 --> 00:07:37,877
WRITERS TALKING ABOUT ONE

267
00:07:37,878 --> 00:07:39,179
SCENARIO WHERE THE PRESIDENT

268
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,147
GETS ASSASSINATED, WHERE THE

269
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:42,715
SECRET SERVICE COLLABORATES WITH

270
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:43,716
RUSSIANS TO KILL HIM.

271
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:45,585
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THAT?

272
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:48,154
>> I FIND IT ABSOLUTELY

273
00:07:48,155 --> 00:07:49,389
ABHORRENT AND DISGRACEFUL.

274
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:53,526
IT IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF THING

275
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:54,661
THE PRESIDENT WAS TALKING ABOUT

276
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:58,498

284
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:12,045
BRIAN: THEY'RE SCRAMBLING WHAT

285
00:08:12,046 --> 00:08:13,446

DO YOU WANT TO ANNOUNCE ANYTHING

296
00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:29,395

00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:16,876
DISGRACEFUL.

CLEAN UP YOUR ACT.

ACT.

345
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:42,302
IT IS THE PERSON WHO MADE AND

BRIAN: NO REACTION DIRECTLY TO

353
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:56,382
JOHN BRENNAN WHO SEEMS TO BE

354
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:58,251
BREAKING WITH TRADITION AS A

355
00:09:58,252 --> 00:10:00,119
FORMER HEAD OF THE CIA, BECOMING

356
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,689
WHAT SEEMS TO BE A PUNDIT?

357
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,091
>> I THINK WE'VE MADE OUR

358
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:07,060
OPINIONS ON FORMER DIRECTOR

359
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:10,063
BRENNAN PRETTY CLEAR OVER THE

360
00:10:10,064 --> 00:10:12,365
PAST SEVERAL MONTHS.

361
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:14,033
CERTAINLY DON'T SUPPORT THE TYPE

362
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:17,604
OF ACTIVITY THAT HE IS ENPAGED

363
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:19,739
IN AND DON'T THINK IT IS

364
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,873
BECOMING SOMEONE A FORMER

365
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:22,842
DIRECTOR OF THE INTELLIGENCE

366
00:10:22,843 --> 00:10:24,010
AGENCY THAT HE WAS.

367
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:26,112
STEVE: SIDE NOTE, OF COURSE THE

368
00:10:26,113 --> 00:10:27,447
MIDTERM ELECTIONS ARE A LITTLE

369
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:28,681
LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AWAY.

370
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:30,550
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT AND HIS

00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:33,620
APPARENTLY HE WILL MAKE SOME

373
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:34,354
OTHER STOPS.

374
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:35,655
GIVEN WHAT IS GOING ON WITH

375
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:39,359
THESE PACKAGES, WILL HE CONTINUE

376
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,660
ON THIS VERY AGGRESSIVE

377
00:10:40,661 --> 00:10:42,228
CAMPAIGNING WITH THE RALLIES AND

378
00:10:42,229 --> 00:10:43,763
WHAT NOT?

379
00:10:43,764 --> 00:10:45,465
OR WILL THEY PARE THINGS BACK OR

380
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:47,033
WHAT IS GOING ON?

381
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:49,035
>> CERTAINLY AS OF RIGHT NOW THE

382
00:10:49,036 --> 00:10:50,003
PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO LAY OUT

383
00:10:50,004 --> 00:10:51,471
THE CASE AND POLITICAL

384
00:10:51,472 --> 00:10:53,273
DIFFERENCES OF DEMOCRATS AND

385
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:55,141
REPUBLICANS, AS HE CERTAINLY

386
00:10:55,142 --> 00:10:55,575
SHOULD.

387
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:57,143
FUTURE AND HISTORY OF OUR

388
00:10:57,144 --> 00:10:59,112
COUNTRY IS AT STAKE.

389
00:10:59,113 --> 00:11:00,280
AMERICANS HAVE A DECISION TO

390
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:02,515
MAKE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS

391
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:04,784
AND PRESIDENT WILL LAY OUT THE

392
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:07,820
CASE FOR WHY REPUBLICANS HAVE

393
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:09,756
BEEN SUCCESSFUL OVER THE LAST

394
00:11:09,757 --> 00:11:11,124
TWO YEARS UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP.

395
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,792
WE HAVE A BOOMING ECONOMY.

396
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:15,361
WE HAVE A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF JOB

397
00:11:15,362 --> 00:11:16,896
CREATION, PARTICULARLY IN

398
00:11:16,897 --> 00:11:17,797
MANUFACTURING, WE HAVE TRADE

399
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:19,032
DEALS THAT EVERYONE SAID

400
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:19,899
COULDN'T BE DONE.

401
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,302
WE HAVE A NATIONAL SECURITY

402
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:24,470
ISSUE AT THE BORDER AND WE HAVE

403
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:25,938
TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT

404
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:27,740
LAW AND ORDER AT THE BORDER OR

405
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:29,542
WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT OPEN

406
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:29,876
BORDER.

407
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:31,244
THE PRESIDENT WILL LAY OUT THE

408
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:32,979
CASE AND AMERICANS WILL MICK A

409
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,814
DECISION AND I THINK THEY WILL

410
00:11:34,815 --> 00:11:36,215
MAKE RIGHT ONE.

411
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:37,950
BRIAN: 12 DAYS AND COUNTING.

412
00:11:37,951 --> 00:00:00,000
