1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:02,474
As more victims come out against
Brett Kavanaugh,

2
00:00:02,474 --> 00:00:06,778
conservatives are trying out all the same
tactics that they have in a past.

3
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:11,049
Like, having him on Fox News for a puff piece
where he even went as far as to say

4
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:14,720
he was a virgin. And this morning
my problematic fav Tomi is back

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,554
to talk about it!

6
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:18,457
I think all of us who watched
that interview last night

7
00:00:18,457 --> 00:00:19,825
couldn’t help but
feel for the guy.

8
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:22,661
Once again, we arrived at
‘he said, she said’ situation.

9
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:25,530
And look, I'm not saying
every accusation is the same,

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,633
I'm not saying every instance
of sexual misconduct is the same.

11
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:31,503
But in this case you are actively
making a choice to believe

12
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:34,272
one side over the other.
And you can’t even argue that

13
00:00:34,272 --> 00:00:37,476
the victim came out of nowhere
to “ruin this person.”

14
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:40,445
But what’s happening right now is
not only a left wing conspiracy,

15
00:00:40,445 --> 00:00:43,715
but it’s just wrong from a human
level Claiming this is a left

16
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:47,753
wing conspiracy is kind of lazy,
especially since Dianne Feinstein

17
00:00:47,753 --> 00:00:51,556
didn’t originally reveal this information,
it was the Intercept that revealed it.

18
00:00:51,556 --> 00:00:54,226
And especially since every other
attempt to smear the victim or

19
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:57,696
portray her as biased was
disproven fairly quickly.

20
00:00:57,696 --> 00:01:00,599
Also you really can’t make a case
that this was a last second

21
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:05,137
attempt, unless you really think
Dr. Ford had a vendetta against

22
00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:08,740
Kavanaugh for decades for some
reason. Since she mentioned this

23
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,210
incident to her therapist in the past,
long before Kavanaugh was

24
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,311
the SCOTUS nominee.

25
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:15,714
And the people who say:
‘What if it was your daughter?’

26
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:19,051
That's a great point. But I also go back at
them and say, "What if it was your son?"

27
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:21,386
Again, do false accusations exist?

28
00:01:21,386 --> 00:01:22,054
Sure.

29
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:24,656
Could they be damaging
for a person’s future?

30
00:01:24,656 --> 00:01:26,158
In some instances, yes.

31
00:01:26,158 --> 00:01:30,128
But false accusations make up
around 2% of the overall charges.

32
00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:33,131
Especially when you consider
that around 40% of the sexual assaults

33
00:01:33,131 --> 00:01:36,535
go unreported, it’s like choosing
the side that’s the victim 2% of the time

34
00:01:36,535 --> 00:01:39,604
as opposed to the 98% – also
this assumes that men are

35
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:42,641
exclusively the perpetrators and
never the victims –

36
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:44,409
which also isn’t true.

37
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:46,978
But go on.
What does Tomi has to say about this?

38
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:50,248
I will remind those so vocal on
the left, especially the men,

39
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:54,286
that are so vocal on the left to
denounce Kavanaugh and to talk

40
00:01:54,286 --> 00:01:56,655
about the survivor and to talk
about the allegations as if

41
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:58,056
they’re gospel truth – I will

42
00:01:58,056 --> 00:02:01,093
remind them that it only takes
one person to come out against them,

43
00:02:01,093 --> 00:02:03,428
from way back in their past
or in their present –

44
00:02:03,428 --> 00:02:06,364
and their lives, their career,
their families could be ruined.

45
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:09,366
Look, you know I make a lot of jokes,
and I say dumb shit all the time.

46
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:11,403
I've certainly said dumb
shit in the past and I probably

47
00:02:11,403 --> 00:02:14,272
going to continue to say dumb
shit in the foreseeable future.

48
00:02:14,272 --> 00:02:17,175
I’ve even also warned against
the weaponization of #MeToo,

49
00:02:17,175 --> 00:02:20,445
especially by bad faith virtue
signalers on the right.

50
00:02:20,445 --> 00:02:23,548
So it’s important to analyze everything
on a case by case basis.

51
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:26,852
But no one is trying to eliminate due
process, and they’re certainly

52
00:02:26,852 --> 00:02:30,122
not trying to do that here.
These right wing attacks aren’t

53
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:32,757
about arriving at the truth,
or due process.

54
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:34,926
Republicans don’t
want due process,

55
00:02:34,926 --> 00:02:36,128
they want silence.

56
00:02:36,128 --> 00:02:40,665
After all, Dr. Christine Ford is willing to
testify, despite the barrage of attacks

57
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:43,101
from right wing figures.
The only other principle

58
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:46,938
involved in the incident who’s
refusing to testify: Mark Judge,

59
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:50,108
who has a personal history of
creepy sexual exploits himself.

60
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:52,944
And all of this is being
discussed without the second

61
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:55,780
accusation Ronan Farrow and Jane
Meyer uncovered on Sunday night

62
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,884
from Yale, everyone involved on
this segment certainly was aware

63
00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:01,186
of that but they're refusing to
discuss that.

64
00:03:01,186 --> 00:03:04,656
I guess what I'm saying is:
believing women just means:

65
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:07,125
don’t reflexively
disbelieve women.

66
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:10,495
It doesn’t mean that relationships can’t be
complicated, or that every man

67
00:03:10,495 --> 00:03:13,698
is going to go to jail for being
in a toxic relationship with a woman.

68
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:18,904
It simply means: let’s take a look at these issues,
especially when a lifetime appointment

69
00:03:18,904 --> 00:03:23,341
for a person who will be making decisions about
women’s autonomy is what at stake here.

70
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:26,912
I’m Hasan Piker, if I made some sense
through all the nonsense

71
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:29,347
please share this video with your friends,
and don’t forget to leave your thoughts
