00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,184
ABOUT ALL KINDS OF ISSUES BUT

34
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:25,054
THE STATEMENT THAT HE ALLEGEDLY

35
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:27,856
SAID ABOUT RECORDING THE

00:01:27,857 --> 00:01:29,691

39
00:01:33,263 --> 00:01:35,564
>> NOW HE SAID HE WAS SAYING IT

40
00:01:35,565 --> 00:01:36,665
SARCASTICALLY AND JOKE.

41
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,700
SINCE HE SAID THAT HE DIDN'T

42
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:41,570
REALLY MEAN THAT IN A SERIOUS

43
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:44,673

IN HIS OP ED HE WRITES THIS.

48
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,352
THIS WAS THE PLAN.

49
00:01:57,353 --> 00:01:59,755

AGENTS ALL WHO SAY THIS WAS A

55
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:13,268
SERIOUS PLOT.

56
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:14,670
THIS WASN'T A JOKE.

57
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:16,271
THERE WAS A REAL DISCUSSION IN

58
00:02:16,272 --> 00:02:18,607

THINK ABOUT HOW EXTRA ORDINARY

63
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:27,015
THAT IS.

00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:29,351

00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:38,560

00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:01,884
HE HAS TO COME IN AND ANSWER

78
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:02,251
QUESTIONS.

79
00:03:02,252 --> 00:03:04,953

96
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:42,925
WHEN HE SAID HE BELIEVED

97
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:44,626

00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:47,796

ABOUT THE BIG LIE THE MORE THEY

00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:03,805

132
00:05:03,806 --> 00:05:06,642
THAT'S THE TECHNIQUE AND METHOD

133
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:11,680

SIMPSON WAS WORKING FOR THE

142
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:27,796
OPPOSITION.

143

00:05:43,112 --> 00:05:45,147
THAT'S NEVER SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN

151
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:46,848

IS HE A WITNESS?

159
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:04,399
>> EXACTLY RIGHT, THERE ARE ALL

160
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,635
KINDS OF CONFLICTS HERE.

161
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:10,972
WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN IN

162
00:06:10,973 --> 00:06:12,808
CONFLICT IN ARGUING ABOUT WHO

163
00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:14,209
SHOULD BE REDUCED.

164
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,745
BOTH OF THEM SHOULD BE REDUCED.

165
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:18,480
>>Reporter: LET ME ASK YOU

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,763
NO, THERE ARE.

00:06:34,764 --> 00:06:39,801
LIKE YOU SAID, BOTH OF THEM

174
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:41,336

00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:45,707
ROSENSTEIN WROTE THE MEMO THAT

WAS GIVEN TO THE PRESIDENT ONE

178
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:55,317
OF THE THINGS MUELLER IS LOOKING

00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:57,519
INTO IS OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

180
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,855
NEITHER SHOULD BE INVOLVED.

181
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:02,591
MCCABE ISN'T BECAUSE HE'S BEEN

182
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:04,693
FIRED.

183
00:07:04,694 --> 00:07:05,861
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE

184
00:07:05,862 --> 00:07:08,196
WOULDN'T FIRE ROSENSTEIN, SHOULD

185
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:10,265
HE STEP DOWN?

186
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:12,534
>> WELL, LOOK, I'M NOT A FAN OF

187
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:15,370
MR.  ROSENSTEIN.

188
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:18,006

THE SCOPE.

192
00:07:26,716 --> 00:07:30,252
WE ASKED FOR SPECIFIC PORTIONS

193
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:33,288
OF THE FISA AND HAVEN'T BEEN

194
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:34,322
ABLE TO SEE THAT.

195
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:38,560
WE ASKED FOR 302s DETAILS WHAT

196
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:40,695
HE SAID AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN

197
00:07:40,696 --> 00:07:41,696
THAT.

198
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:43,732
JON, THE GUY PUT IN CHARGE OF

199
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:46,067
THE U.S. ATTORNEY WE HAVEN'T HAD

200
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:48,170
ONE REPORT IN THE LAST SIX

201
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:55,243
MONTHS SINCE BEEN ON-THE-JOB.

202
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:59,114
TAKE ALL OF THAT THAT'S WHAT

203
00:07:59,115 --> 00:08:00,816
FLUSTRATES ME AND YOU AND THE

204
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:02,350
MEDIA AND THOSE PEOPLE A CROSS

205
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:04,352
THE GREAT COUNTRY THAT WANT TO

206
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:10,025
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

207
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:12,060
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE

208
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:12,494
IMPLICATIONS.

209
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:14,596
YOU JUST RATTLED OFF A FEW

210
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:18,166
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE PUBLIC.

211
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:21,303
WILL THE PRESIDENT DECLASSIFY

212
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:26,341
THESE.COM

213
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:26,374
THESE DOM

214
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,242
THESE DOCUMENTS?

215
00:08:27,243 --> 00:08:30,111
>> LET'S HOPE SO, I A FEW WEEKS

216
00:08:30,112 --> 00:08:32,147
AGO THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD

217
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:34,082
DECLASSIFY THEM.

218
00:08:34,082 --> 00:08:37,084
HE ALTERED THAT AND SAID HE WILL

219
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:39,354
RUN IT BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL.

220
00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:41,456
I THINK WE'LL GET THE

221
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:41,857
INFORMATION.

222
00:08:41,857 --> 00:08:43,591
WE NEED TO BECAUSE AGAIN, WE

223
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:45,927
HAVE TO GET ANSWERS FROM THE

224
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:47,229
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT GO TO

225
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,764
THE HEART OF THE IDEA THAT IT

226
00:08:49,765 --> 00:08:51,500
SHOULD BE EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER

227
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:52,801
THE LAW.

228
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:54,936
IT'S SUPPOSE TO BE THE RULE OF

229
00:08:54,937 --> 00:08:55,437
LAW.

230
00:08:55,438 --> 00:09:00,108
THAT'S HOW THE FBI STARTED AND

231
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:04,312
LOST AND RAN THE INVESTIGATION.

232
00:09:04,313 --> 00:09:07,516
>> THEY WERE OVERSEEING TWO

233
00:09:07,517 --> 00:09:07,983
INVESTIGATIONS.

234
00:09:07,984 --> 00:09:10,452
AT THE SAME TIME THEY RAN THE

235
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:11,119
INVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY

236
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,854
CLINTON AND HER E-MAIL SCANDAL

237
00:09:12,855 --> 00:09:15,824
AND THOSE TWO WERE HANDLED VERY

238
00:09:15,825 --> 00:09:16,224
DIFFERENTLY.

239
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:18,059
YOU SAID IT, THIS IS ABOUT

240
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,595
AMERICA AND THE RULE OF LAW.

241
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:22,831
THIS SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED.

242
00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:25,867
PEOPLE OF POWER PUT THEIR FINGER

243
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:28,537
ON THE SCALE.

244
00:09:28,538 --> 00:09:31,740
WILL THERE BE ACCOUNTABILITY.

245
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,909
>> I HOPE WE GET A JUSTICE

246
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,911
DEPARTMENT THAT WILL HOLD PEOPLE

247
00:09:35,912 --> 00:09:36,311
ACCOUNTABLE.

248
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:39,581
THE FLUSTERING PART IS THE

249
00:09:39,582 --> 00:09:40,081
PATTERN.

250
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:46,221
WE HAD THE IRS TARGET THEM AND

251
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:47,756
SHE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE CONGRESS.

252
00:09:47,757 --> 00:09:50,592
WE HAD BRYAN SET UP THE E-MAIL

253
00:09:50,593 --> 00:09:50,926
SEVERS.

254
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:53,428
HE WAS CALLED AND TOOK THE

255
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:53,929
FIFTH.

256
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,565
WE HAVE GLENN SIMPSON THE GUY

257
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:58,700
PAID FOR BY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN

258
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:02,137
AND PUT TOGETHER THE FAKE

259
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:02,470
DOSSIER.

260
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:03,738
HE WILL COME IN FRONT OF

261
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:09,444
CONGRESS AND TAKE THE FIFTH AS

262
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:09,744
WELL.

263
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:12,380
IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE ALL

264
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:15,817
GETTING AWAY WITH IT.

265
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:17,586
>> THAT HE SAYS WHAT DRIVING

266
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:18,887
AMERICANS CRAZY.

267
00:10:18,888 --> 00:10:24,626
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT

268
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:27,462
STANDARDS THAT'S WHY I'M

269
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:29,397
DETERMINED TO GET THE SUBPOENAS

270
00:10:29,398 --> 00:10:33,134
WE NEED AND PROSECUTE PEOPLE WHO

271
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:33,902
DESERVE IT.

272
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:35,904
>> THERE IS A BIG IF.

273
00:10:35,905 --> 00:10:38,340
IF YOU HOLD ONTO IT MAJORITY.

274
00:10:38,341 --> 00:00:00,000
MANY WONDER IF THEY WILL
