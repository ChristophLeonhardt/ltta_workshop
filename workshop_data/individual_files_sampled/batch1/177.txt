the condemnation was Swift the disappointment evident along with the US flag documents representing a Rasna clear deal were burned in Parliament politicians are now assessing their options at home and abroad if Europe and important countries like Russia and China fill this international vacuum perhaps there will be a way to continue otherwise the Islamic Republic of Iran will bring the u.s. to its senses with its nuclear actions they have to know that under such circumstances Iran has no commitment to remain in the nuclear position it was in before minutes after the u.s. pola from the 2015 nuclear deal Iran's president Hassan rouhani said the US has once more proved itself to be an unreliable negotiating partner that charge of it how they've done nothing except put empty signatures on pieces of paper without doing anything about it the Iranian mission on the other hand has agreed to everything and accomplished all its responsibilities newspaper headlines show disagreements on how Iran shall respond moderates want the deal to go on without Trump hardliners though stressed the deal should be completely scrapped but both sides are not bracing for an economic impact the withdrawal means more pressure will be exerted on the people and the country we'll go back to the days of resorting to smuggling to bring in goods and bypass sanctions despite the u.s. pulled out rouhani isn't giving up without a fight he championed the nuclear agreement in the face of hardline critics at home who said it was unlikely to succeed any Iranian hopes of still benefitting from the deal and keeping it alive now rests in the hands of the country's foreign minister who helped negotiate it following his President's speech javad zarif tweeted that he would spearhead diplomatic efforts he hopes to convince other signatories to isolate the US and not give in to pressure from the White House but that approach is questionable in the face of crippling US sanctions on Iran and the threat of secondary sanctions on countries and companies the does business with Iran's not going to give the u.s. any kin sessions neither on it regional role and it's what it sees as it struggle against extremism nor with regards to its defense capabilities and its missile defense because it knows that the only thing that prevents the United States from attacking Iran is its defense capabilities president rouhani has always said that his government pursued dialogue to avoid conflict but in his speech he spoke about old wars with the u.s. the kinds of things that the nuclear deal was designed to leave in the past katia dopest of a yawn al-jazeera
