I lived in Israel for four years and I
demonstrated a lot fare for Palestinian
rights and it feels very similar to
there there might be a little less
hostile elite hostility by the police
towards the towards the protesters here
so I guess I'll come I commend that I
understand but yeah it feels it feels
like Israel even with the two sides and
everything and the the stupid shouting
and like the whole thing
you
