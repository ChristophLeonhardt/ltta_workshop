inequality is a word that's been hijacked by the left to invoke a visceral response when said but when translated it merely means I have no idea what I'm talking about look how virtuous I sound look at me it's a word constantly used to manipulate and propagandize certain popular socialist and communist themes around the world for example an article in the BBC titled inequality in India can be seen from space who sounds awful and scary right well let's see I've been Davies this is pure olive oil let's just break down how propaganda works I'm on snapchat and I see a photo of India from space at night all lit up but words over it saying inequality in India can be seen from space two things happen here first your mind says this is a huge problem ie from space and the words tell you this is terrible hook line & sinker for most people with absolutely zero empirical evidence given and also that India looks pretty lit up from space at night seems like they're doing pretty good but do you see what they did there India actually opened its economic doors about three decades ago and it seemed a vast improvement and no not perfect even in the past seven years its poorest of poor have been shrunk by 1/3 in just seven years and its total economic growth has skyrocketed thus the lights from space not more honest photo of inequality would be in North Korea and South Korea from space but I digress first off inequality means everyone makes something different and what politicians and Marxist sympathizers cannot say anymore is that the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer because they're not everyone is getting richer in the past two decades capitalism in the free market have brought 1 billion people out of abject poverty that's half in two decades so the truth is the richer are getting richer and the poor are getting richer as well but here's how they still complain let's just say the poorest people live on one dollar a day and they get a 10% increase now they make a dollar 10 a day that's a huge increase in these people's state of living and at the same time the entrepreneurs and the rich also see a 10% increase say they make a million dollars a day and they see an increase of $100,000 they can then invest expand their business or just spend elsewhere but they say the inequality has increased and thus that's the problem this is propaganda the a solution to this inequality is simple take the money from the few people who are stimulating the entire comedy and bringing people out of abject poverty and distribute their wealth among the millions of people they all get maybe I don't know a penny extra a day people feel happy and virtuous and the 1 entrepreneur leaves and the entire country turns into Venezuela you know like when the government sees private business and their number-one export here's a simple example for you in the NBA there is a vast inequality in players LeBron James is way better than everyone else he gets paid more - however he also allows players who are awful to get paid more and go to the NBA Finals every year is this fair no we should put a rule on minutes and make sure everyone gets paid exactly the same because that would elevate the quality of the game right drink the drive of the players and level of play would increase or decrease with this new formula viewership would tank salaries would decrease and the game would be awful but hey inequality would be eliminated right just a friendly reminder the next time this buzzword inequality as espoused by one of your friends simply ask them show me a country that has done the most to eliminate inequality within its borders Building scoff and say it's never been tried properly before before they go and burn all the history books showing the hundreds of millions of citizens imprisoned and killed by their own governments all in the name of equality I've been Davey this is pure Hollywood all right so if you enjoyed that video please consider becoming a Premium Member - the rebel that way you have first access to pure Hollywood and the entire rebel lineup you
