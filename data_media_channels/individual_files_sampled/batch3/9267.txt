Shepard: BREAKING NEWS COMING IN NOW. THIS IS A LIVE PICTURE AND THE CAMERA IS ON A SWIVEL AT THE MOMENT. WE'VE GOT QUITE A RUCKUS. LISTEN. ARRESTS ARE BEING MADE. THIS IS THE HEART SENATE OFFICE BUILDING IN D.C. PHILIP A. HART SENATE BUILDING AND LOCATED AT SECOND STREET NORTHEAST BETWEEN CONSTITUTION AVENUE AND C STREET. A LOT OF PROTESTERS HAVE BEEN OUT THERE. THEY MADE THEIR WAY INTO THE BUILDING. THE POLICE JUST A SHORT TIME AGO AS WE WERE WATCHING WHILE YOU WERE IN COMMERCIAL ORDERING EVERYBODY TO CEASE AND DESIST, I SUPPOSE. THEN BE AGAIN MAKING ARRESTS. THEY'RE MAKING NUMEROUS ARRESTS AS THE NEWS IS BREAKING. THAT'S A LOOK UP TO THE CENTER OF THE BUILDING. THERE'S A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN CONGREGATE AND HERE THAT AREA IS. LISTEN TO WHAT SOUNDS LIKE A BIT OF CHAOS IN THERE. . THERE'S BEEN PROTESTS, OF COURSE, AS EXPECTED AND ORGANIZED FROM MINUTE WHEN IT WAS CLEAR THAT THIS VOTE WOULD GO THIS WAY. THE PROTESTERS ARE OUT AND ABOUT ALL OVER THE DISTRICT THIS AFTERNOON, I'M TOLD. THE SENATE COULD MAKE A FINAL DECISION AS WE'VE BEEN REPORTING HERE BY SATURDAY, MAYBE SUNDAY IF THIS PRELIMINARY VOTE GETS UNDERWAY AS SCHEDULED. THE PRELIMINARY VOTE LET'S GET TO CHAD PERGRAM WHO IS LIVE ON CAPITOL HILL WHAT ARE WE THINKING HERE? I'VE BEEN TOLD IN THE PAST TEN MINUTES, THEY WOULD EXPECT THIS PROCEDURAL VOTE TO COME SOMETIME IN THE LATE MORNING TOMORROW BUT BEFORE LUNCH. WHEN HAPPENS WHEN YOU VOTE TO CUT OFF A FILIBUSTER IN DEBATE? IT TAKES 51 VOTES. IT INITIATES A 30-HOUR CLOCK. SO LET'S SAY THEY VOTE AT 11:00 A.M. IT TAKES 30 MINUTES TO HAVE THAT ROLL CALL VOTE. THEY CLOSE IT AT 11:30 AND COUNT 30 HOURS PASSED THAT. THAT WOULD GET TO 5:00, 6:00 SATURDAY NIGHT IF THE DEMOCRATS BURN ALL 30 HOURS. YOU CAN MAKE THE SUNRISE IN THE WEST IF YOU GOT UNANIMOUS CONCERT. THEY CAN MOVE IT UP OR BACK IF ALL 100 SENATORS AGREE. WHAT IS UNKNOWN IF THE DEMOCRATS WILL USE THEIR TIME ONCE IT'S PUT IN MOTION SOMETIME TOMORROW, SHEP. Shepard: THESE DEMONSTRATIONS NOT UNEXPECTED I GUESS. RIGHT, THIS IS A BIG NOMINATION, TENSIONS ARE HIGH HERE. A LOT OF PROTESTERS IN THE BUILDING. I WAS OUTSIDE THE CAPITOL. THEY PUT UP A BARRICADE AROUND THE CAPITOL THAT ONLY PEOPLE WITH HARD PASSES CAN GET IN OR OUT. THEY'RE ESCORTING SENATORS TO AND FROM VOTES. I FOLLOWED LISA MURKOWSKI FROM ALASKA. SHE LEFT THE SKIFF WHERE THEY WERE BRIEFING SENATORS ON THE FBI REPORT. I TOOK THIS PASS THROUGH THE BASEMENT OF THE CAPITOL, THROUGH THE VISITORS CENTER AND CAME OUT ON THE HOUSE SIDE. THAT'S WHERE I TALKED TO HER ABOUT 1 1/2 HOURS AGO. SHE SAYS THAT SHE HAS NOT YET MADE A DECISION. SHE DOES SAY THAT IT IS DECISION TIME. WHAT WE THINK THE MATH IS RIGHT NOW, AT A MINIMUM, MITCH McCONNELL WILL GET 50 VOTES IN THIS NOMINATION. IF HE GETS COLLINS, JEFF FLAKE, MAYBE LISA MURKOWSKI. IF HE'S 50/50, THE PRESIDENT HAVE BREAK A TIE. NEVER HAS A VICE PRESIDENT BROKEN THE TIE. IS THAT YOUR NOT TALKING ABOUT JOE MANCHIN. HE'S NOT GOING TO BE THE 51st VOTE. HE SIGNALLED YESTERDAY THAT HE MIGHT BE LEANING IN THAT DIRECTION, BUT WE'RE NOT SURE, SHEP. Shepard: IF IT'S A DONE DEAL, IT'S A POSSIBILITY AGAIN. HE'S IN THE SKIFF STILL LOOKING AT THIS. CHAD, STAY WITH US, IF YOU COULD. WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THE DEMONSTRATIONS. THE ARRESTS APPEAR TO BE HAPPENING IN SOMEWHAT ORDERLY FASHION.
