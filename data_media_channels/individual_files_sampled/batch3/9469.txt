GRIFF JENKINS REPORTING LIVE FROM TALLAHASSEE. THANK YOU. Sandra: JOINING IS NOW, MARCO RUBIO. SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR CALLING IN THIS MORNING. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE SEEING? WE JUST FINALLY BEGAN TO GET A LOOK AT THE ACTUAL DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION TO YOUR STATE. I LIVE THROUGH HURRICANE ANDREW, MULTIPLE HURRICANES, BUT ANDREW WAS THE ONE THAT'S MOST STRUCK ME. AFTER THE STORM, THE OFFICIAL REPORTS, IT'S NOT TOO BAD, AND SUDDENLY, THEY WERE LIKE OH, MY GOODNESS. IT'S STILL EARLY. THAT'S THE KIND OF NEWS THAT I AM GETTING FROM PEOPLE ON THE GROUND. WE DODGED THE BULLET, BUT THE SUN HAS COME UP. PEOPLE STARTED TO SEE IT. PANAMA CITY, THE ELECTRIC GRID IS UNJUST OR DAMAGED, IT STRUTTED. SO IT WILL HAVE TO BE REBUILT, NOT JUST RESTORED. SOMEBODY TOLD ME POINT BLANK, TALK TO THEM LAST NIGHT, THEY SAID OF MEXICO BEACH IT'S GONE. THE CHARMING OLD FLORIDA TOWN. I THINK THE BIGGEST FEAR HERE OF COURSE, THIS IS GOING TO BE AN INCREDIBLE CHALLENGE FOR MONTHS TO COME. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO STEP UP AND REALLY BE HELPFUL. THIS IS THE KIND OF EVENTS THAT COULD CHANGE THE CHARACTERISTIC OF A COMMUNITY. FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE IT AND TAKE A DECADE TO RECOVER IF IT'S NOT DONE APPROPRIATELY. SO I THINK THIS JUST TURNED OUT TO BE AS BAD AS WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE. POTENTIALLY WORSE. WE WILL LEARN MORE THROUGHOUT THE DAY, BUT WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS THERE ARE A LOT OF LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN DISRUPTED, AND IT IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REBUILD. I'M HEADED TO THE FEMA HEADQUARTERS IN A FEW MINUTES. I WILL BE HEADED TO NORTHWEST FLORIDA. OBVIOUSLY, I HOPE MY EARLY ASSESSMENT IS WRONG. I FEAR I'M NOT. Sandra: WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS VIDEO. IT IS JUST AWFUL. ABOUT DOWNED WIRES AND TREES CAUSING ALL LOTS OF THREATS, STI CAUSING ALL LOTS OF THREATS, STL POSING AS TO THOSE IN THE AREA. WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR? WHAT DOES YOUR STATE NEEDS IN TERMS OF FEDERAL RESOURCES? WELL, I THINK IT'S GOING TO NEED A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING. I'VE BEEN UPDATING PEOPLE ON TWITTER ABOUT SORT OF THE FEDERAL RESOURCES THAT ARE ON STANDBY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE READY TO OFFER AND SO FORTH. RIGHT NOW, WE ARE STILL ON THE SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION MISSIONS. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF EFFORTS DEPLOYED. THE LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST, AND IS ON THE HARD WORK BEGINS. RESTORING POWER APPEARED WITHOUT POWER, YOU HAVE NO CELL PHONE POWERS, NO ABILITY TO SUSTAIN LIFE. THE MINUTE YOU TURN THE POWER ON, YOU COULD KILL SOMEONE, YOU COULD START A FIRE. ALL SORTS OF THINGS CAN HAPPEN. IT IS A VERY COMPLICATED THING THAT LIES AHEAD. IT IS NOT JUST THE HURRICANE, BUT THE WATER DAMAGE. THE HOMES LOOK INTACT, ABOUT THE WATER DAMAGE IS GOING TO FORCE AT HOME TO BE DEMOLISHED. I THINK WHAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED HIS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE, AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A MASSIVE HOUSING PROBLEM HERE. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SHELTER THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME WITH WHO WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES. BECAUSE OF DOWNED POWER LINES, OBSTRUCTIONS IN THE ROAD. SO THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE SORT OF WHERE DO WE HOUSE PEOPLE? THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE NO PLACE TO LIVE HERE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I'M GOING TO PRESS ON WHEN I GO TO FEMA HERE IN A FEW MINUTES WHEN WE ARE DONE WITH THAT BRIEFING. Sandra: OBVIOUSLY, THE IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC TOLL WILL BE THE HEADLINE IN ADDITION TO THE LOSS OF LIFE THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPERIENCED. THEN CONSIDERING THAT TOURIST DESTINATION THAT SO MANY OF THESE CITIES AND TOWNS IN FLORIDA ARE, THE LONG TERMS AFFECT I'M SURE WILL BE A LONG-TERM EFFECT. I HAVE TO ASK YOU WHILE WE HAVE YOU ABOUT THIS. ABOUT THE STILL MISSING SAUDI JOURNALIST. OBVIOUSLY, WAS A BIG CRITIC OF THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT. THIS IS A BIG HEADLINE. CONGRESS IS STEPPING IN. THEY ARE TAKING THE LEAD ON THIS. YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. WHAT'S ARE YOU ASKING FOR? WHAT DOES YOUR COMMITTEE WANT TO KNOW? WE HAVE TRICKLED AN ENTIRE INVESTIGATION. THIS IS GOING TO GO BEYOND SANCTIONS. OBVIOUSLY, I AM PRIVY TO SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHICH I CANNOT SHARE. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I AM NOT SAYING THAT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED, BUT WE WILL LEARN IT SOON ENOUGH. THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT DEMANDED A GUIDE TO BE OBJECTIVE, THEY SENT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE INTO KILL HIM AND CHOP THEM UP, IF THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED, I AM TELLING YOU WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE IS A COMPLETE REVOLT AGAINST OUR POLICIES WITH SAUDI ARABIA. IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT PARTNER IN MIDDLE EASTERN STRATEGY TO CONTAIN SORT OF IRAN'S NEFARIOUS ACTIVITIES IN THE REGION. BUT IF THEY HAVE GONE SO FAR AS TO KILL THIS GUY, CUT THE BODY UP, AND SEND A CREW HERE TO DO THAT, IF THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT, AND I'M NOT SAYING THEY ARE, WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT WHEN THE EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED. BUT IF THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED, THEN I AM TELLING YOU WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE IS GOING TO BE IN AN EFFORT TO COMPLETELY FUNDAMENTALLY ALTERED THE RELATIONSHIP. I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION IS AWARE OF THAT TOO. I HOPE THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. I HOPE THIS GENTLEMAN IS ALIVE, BUT I FEAR THAT THIS THING IS GOING TO TAKE A NEGATIVE TURN HERE PRETTY QUICKLY, ESPECIALLY IF ANY OF THE STUFF THAT IS OUT HERE TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE. Sandra: JAMAAL KHASHOGGI IS THE NAME OF THE JOURNALIST. YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING INTO THIS FURTHER. ANY IDEA WHAT WOULD HAVE INSPIRED AND ACT LIKE YOU ARE SUGGESTING? I AM SPECULATING, BUT GOVERNMENTS THINK THAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH SILENCING CRITICS BY ELIMINATING THEM, THEY HAVE BEEN DOING SO RECENTLY. YOU HAVE SEEN THAT IN CHINA FOR EXAMPLE, THEY ARRESTED THE HEAD OF INTERVAL. KILLED PEOPLE, OPPONENTS OF VLADIMIR PUTIN WANDA PRETTY MUCH ROUTINELY DYING, FALLING OUT OF WINDOWS. A MYSTERIOUS HEART ATTACKS, OR JUST FLAT OUT POISON. OBVIOUSLY SAW WHAT NORTH KOREA DID TO HIS OWN BROTHER BECAUSE HE WAS RUNNING LOOSE. SO IF THIS IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE, IT WOULD BE IN LINE WITH WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS DO AROUND THE WORLD. I JUST HOPE FOR KHASHOGGI SAKE, FOR HIS FIANCEE, THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A COMPLETE AND TOTAL REVOLT ON CAPITOL HILL, BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT. IT'S AN IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP, BUT WE CANNOT ALLOW FOR THAT TO SILENCE US IN THE FACE OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS IF THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED. Sandra: SENATOR MARCO RUBIO, THANKS FOR CALLING IN THIS MORNING. HOPEFULLY HE CAN KEEP US UPDATED ON THIS AND THE OTHER STATE THAT
