FIGHT SURROUNDING HIS NOMINATION, MIER IF VENT HOPE IS THAT MY FERVENT HOPE IS THAT NOMINATION, MIER IF VENT HOPE IS THAT MY FERVENT HOPE IS THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH WILL WORK TO LESSEN THE DIVISIONS IN THE SUPREME COURT. SO THAT WE HAVE NAR FEWER 5-4 DECISIONS, FAR FEWER. SO THAT PUBLIC CONFIDENCE, IN OUR JUDICIARY AND OUR HIGHEST COURT, IS RESTORED. Sean: MORE SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS CRITICIZING THE PARTISANSHIP THROUGHOUT THE KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION HEARING, HER, HOPE THAT JUSTICE KAVANAUGH KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION HEARING, HER, HOPE THAT JUSTICE KAVANAUGH WILL RESTORE OUR SYSTEM. SENATOR TED CRUISE, IN 32 DAYS ARE YOU ON THE BALLOT. YES. Sean: GOING UP AGAINST, WHAT’S HIS NAME, BETO O’ROARKE, I KEEP READING A CULT FIGURE. IN SPITE OF AWFUL THINGS HE’S WRITTEN ABOUT WOMEN, A, AND APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO A POLICE REPORT GOT A DUI AND LIED ABOUT APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO A POLICE REPORT GOT A DUI AND LIED ABOUT LEAVING THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT, ACCORDING TO THE REPORT. HOW WOULD HE VOTE IN THE SENATE, WOULD HE VOTE FOR SENATOR SCHUMER, WOULD HE HAVE VOTED AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH? BETO O’ROARKE IS A HARD KNOW ON BRETT KAVANAUGH. HE WAS A HARD NO BEFORE THE ALLEGATIONS, HE’S A HARD NO NOW. HE’S RUNNING A FAR LEFT CAMPAIGN ALLEGATIONS, HE’S A HARD NO NOW. HE’S RUNNING A FAR LEFT CAMPAIGN LIKE ELIZABETH WARREN, BERNIE SANDERS. TODAY WAS A GOOD DAY. TOMORROW, JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH IS GOING TO BECOME JUSTICE BRETT TOMORROW, JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH IS GOING TO BECOME JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH. BUT WE WON BY THE SLIMMEST OF MARGINS. IT’S WHY THIS ELECTION MATTERS, WHY IT MATTERS THAT WE COP OUT AND STAND UP. THE SMEAR CAMPAIGN, WE HAVE SEEN, PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS HAS BEEN A NEW AND DISGRACEFUL LOW FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE. IT’S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO JUST GO AFTER AND SLANDER JUDGE KAVANAUGH, SLANDER HIS FAMILY. FEET HIS KIDS TO THIS KIND OF HORRIFIC ABUSE. IT’S NOT RIGHT. Sean: SENATOR, I LIVE IN NEW YORK, ROUGH AND TUMBLE, OF NEW YORK. PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE STREET WISE THAN I SHOULD BE IN LIFE. BUT I’D RATHER LIVE IN TEXAS, BECAUSE YOU PAY NO STATE INCOME TAXES. AND NEW YORK STATE . WE’D LOVE TO HAVE YOU, SEAN. Sean: I WANT TO ASK THIS. YOU’VE BEEN IN ROUGH AND TUMBLE RACES. YOU AND THE PRESIDENT HAVE DISAGREEMENTS. YOU HAVE SUPPORTED THE AGENDA OF THE BIGGEST TAX CUT, SECURING OUR BORDERS. ABSOLUTELY. Sean: CONSERVATIVE ORIGINALIST ON THE SUPREME COURT. YOU ARE KNOWN FOR YOUR NL OF THE CONSTITUTION, YOUR KNOWLEDGE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE DANGERS, IF THIS BEHAVIOR WERE TO BE REWARDED? WELL, WHAT WE’VE SEEN IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IS THE EXTREME LEFT, IS JUST FILLED WITH RAGE, THEY’RE FILLED WITH ANGER, THEY’RE FILLED WITH HATRED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. IT’S SPILLING OUT, IT’S SPILLING OUT IN NASTY AND ANGRY PROTESTS IT’S SPILLING OUT, IT’S SPILLING OUT IN NASTY AND ANGRY PROTESTS DURING THE KAVANAUGH HEARING. FIRST DAVE OF THE HEARING, 07 PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED WITH THE ACTIVE COMPLICITY OF DEMOCRATIC SENATORS. JUST YESTERDAY, 300 PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED AT THE CAPITOL. WE’RE SEEING AN ANGER, BITTERNESS. YOU KNOW, THIS WEEK WE HAD SOME ONE SEND WHITE POWDER TO OUR CAMPAIGN OFFICE IN TEXAS THAT ENDED UP HAVING HAZ-MAT AND THE FBI CALLED IN BECAUSE THE CONCERN WAS THAT IT WAS ANTHRAX. TURNED OUT TO BE NEGATIVE. BUT WE’RE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE’S AN ANGER, A RAGE, A FURY, AND IT’S WRONG. IT IS WRONG TO JUST SMEAR SOME ONE’S CHARACTER LIKE THEY HAVE DONE ON TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH. IT’S WRONG TO DO WHAT THE DEMOCRATS DID TO OUT DR. FORD. SHE ASKED THAT THE ALLEGATIONS BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL. THE CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS DIDN’T CARE, THEY OUTED HER AGAINST HER WILL. THAT IS WRONG. WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO DISAGREE WITH EACH OTHER BUT STILL ENGAGE WITH CIVILITY, TREAT EACH OTHER WITH DECENCY. Sean: YOU KNOW, YOU WERE IN A TOUGH PRIMARY WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. IT’S NOT BEANBAGS. SURE. Sean: YOU GAVE, TOOK. NUDZ A DEBATE AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU WERE ASKED, WELL, WHY DID YOU MAKE THE DECISION TO GO ALONG WITH THE PRESIDENT. YOU SAID I’M HERE TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS. SEEMS LIKE THAT CAMPAIGN, I KNOW THE PRESIDENT IS A DISRUPTOR, HE SEEMS LIKE THAT CAMPAIGN, I KNOW THE PRESIDENT IS A DISRUPTOR, HE BREAKS A LOT OF DISHES, BUT WE SEE THE RESULTS, DON’T WE. AND YOU PUT THE PEOPLE OF YOUR STATE AHEAD. NOTHING EVER HAS BEEN THIS BAD. I’VE NEVER SEEN THINGS THIS AWFUL. THE ANGER, THE FURY, THE FRANKLY THREATS OF VIOLENCE ARE REALLY DISTURBING. Sean: DUE PROCESS. SENATORS, PEOPLE SHOWING UP AT THEIR HOUSE, THREATENING THEIR FAMILY. IT’S NOT GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY. AND YOU LOOK AT THIS HEARING, THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF DUE PRINCIPLES OF THE PRESUMPTION OF PROCESS, AS YOU SAID, THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE PRESUMPTION OFINNOCENCE, YOU’RE INNOCENT UNTIL INNOCENCE, YOU’RE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. YOU KNOW, LISTEN, ONCE THESE ALLEGATIONS WERE MADE THEY WERE SERIOUS. NEEDED TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT. WE NEEDED A FULL AND FAIR HEARING, AND WE DID. WE NEEDED TO GIVE DR. FORD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TREAT HER WITH RESPECT AND WE DID. BUT WE NEED TO GIVE JUDGE KAVANAUGH AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND HIMSELF. AND HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TREATED WERE RESPECT AND HE WASN’T. THEY DID THEATRICS AND MOCK THE DEMOCRATS COULDN’T, INSTEAD, OUTRAGE. SHOCKED, SHOCKED THAT TEENAGERS DRINK IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. GOODNESS GRACIOUS. AND THEY WERE EVEN MORE SHOCKED THINGS IN THEIR YEAR STUPID THAT 17-YEAR-OLDS SAY STEW PILD THINGS IN THE YEAR BOOKS. ITS WAS A RIDICULOUS CIRCUS. THEY WERE WILLING TO SMEAR A GOOD MAN AND HIS FAMILY FOR POLITICAL ENDS. Sean: AND NO CORROBORATION, NO CORROBORATION. YES. Sean: I WATCHED YOU AND I KNOW YOUR WIFE, HEIDI, GET RUN OUT OF A RESTAURANT. WE’VE SEEN IT HAPPEN TO SECRETARY NIELSEN. PAM BONDI, SARAH SANDERS, MITCH McCONNELL. I DON’T THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE THE HALLS OF THE SENATE OPEN. AND I’M SAYING THAT FOR THE SAFETY, PROTECTION OF PEOPLE WE ELECT. I FEEL FOR EVERYONE’S SAFETY AT THIS MOMENT. THERE ARE A LOT OF SENATORS WHO ARE HAVING THAT CONVERSATION. MONDAY NIGHT, HEIDI WAS UP IN D.C. AND THE TWO OF US WENT OUT ABOUT 9:00 AT NIGHT TO DO A DATE D.C. AND THE TWO OF US WENT OUT ABOUT 9:00 AT NIGHT TO DO A DATE NIGHT, TWO OF US, WE DON’T GET TO DO THAT VERY OFTEN. WE SHOWED UP AT A RESTAURANT THAT WE LOVE. UNFORTUNATELY SOMEHOW THE PROTESTERS WERE THERE WAITING FOR US AS WE WALKED IN, THEY SURROUNDED US, THEY SCREAMED AT US, THEY BASICALLY SHUT DOWN THE SURROUNDED US, THEY SCREAMED AT US, THEY BASICALLY SHUT DOWN THE RESTAURANT AND THEY MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE DINNER. SO HEIDI AND I GOT UP TO LEAVE, THEY BLOCKED HER FROM GETTING OUT. WHEN WE LEFT THE RESTAURANT, THIS ACTUALLY HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED, BUT WE LEFT THE RESTAURANT, WENT OUT THE DOOR AND AROUND THE BACK ALLEY. THIS MOB OF ABOUT 15 SCREAMING LEFT INTEREST PROTESTERS CHASED HEIDI AND ME DOWN THE ALLEY SCREAMING AND YELLING AT US. A WAITER FROM THE RESTAURANT LET US IN THE BACK DOOR TO THE KITCHEN. AND WE TOOK SHELTER IN THE KITCHEN WITH THIS SCREAMING MOB OUTSIDE. NOW, I TELL YOU A HAPPY ENDING, ABOUT 10 MINUTES LATER THE POLICE ARRIVED AND THEY REMOVED THE PROTESTERS. AND I ASKED HEIDI, WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE? SHE SAID NO. I LIKE THIS RESTAURANT, LET’S HAVE DATE NIGHT. WE WENT BACK THROUGH THE KITCHEN, SAT DOWN AT THE SAME TABLE AND HAD A DELIGHTFUL ROMANTIC DINNER. JUST THE TWO OF US. Sean: GOOD ENDING TO THE STORY. SENATOR, YOU’VE ALWAYS STOOD UP FOR THE CONSTITUTION, DEEPLY HELD PRINCIPLE’S OF DUE PROCESS. AND PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. AND YOUR ELECTION IS IMPORTANT IN 32 DAYS. WE WISH YOU ALL THE BEST.
