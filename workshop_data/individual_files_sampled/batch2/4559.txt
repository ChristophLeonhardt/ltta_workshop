day 518 of the Trump administration few details lots of confusion about how to make the president's executive order ending the separation of migrant families an actual reality the White House would prefer the focus be on these images of the first lady showing compassion doing some damage control admittedly a day after her husband's policy walked back Melania Trump went to McAllen Texas today an unannounced visit to a children's shelter there that currently houses about 60 migrant children think of that most of them teenagers her trip a clear contrast to the images and sounds of children and what appeared to be cages and crying out for their parents the same images same sounds that made this both the humanitarian and publicity crisis let me begin to recognize each of you and thanking you for all what you do for your heroic work that you do every day and what you do for those children they also like to ask you how I can help to these children to reunite with their families the visit was largely uneventful and well reviewed as you heard there the first lady asked how she could help reunite children with their parents instead though the day will be remembered by a choice the first lady made her choice in jackets on an 81 degree day in Washington she wore a green military jacket printed on the back with the statement I really don't care do you she did not wear it during her visit of the children shelter she did wear it getting on and off the plane at Andrews and was seen wearing it after her return to the White House on route to the west wing it has even made the cover of tomorrow's New York Post in the president's home city when asked about the jacket the first lady's office said quote it's just a jacket there's no message but about an hour after she returned to DC the president thought differently about it and wrote on Twitter quote I really don't care do you written on the back of milania's jacket refers to the fake news media Melania has learned how dishonest they are and she truly no longer cares but back to the central question here following this forced policy change when will there be a mechanism to reunite children including infants and toddlers with their families and early look at next week's New Yorker magazine cover shows the profound imagery the artist Barry blitt shows to illustrate these family separations tonight the Washington Post says at least 13 states that it knows of are home to shelters for those children again some as young as a few months old despite repeated requests NBC News cameras have not been allowed inside any of the shelters around the country the Department of Health and Human Services has released these new handout pictures these are government controlled pictures showing conditions inside facilities in Florida and Virginia and that's all we know immigration and the executive order were on the agenda today's cabinet meeting at the White House where the president made sure to show toughness on immigration I signed a very good executive order yesterday but that's only limited no matter how you cut it it leads to separation ultimately I'm directing HHS DHS and DOJ to work together to keep the illegal immigrant families together during the immigration process and to reunite these previously separated groups Mexico by the way is doing nothing for us nothing they have the strongest immigration laws they can do whatever they want they can keep people out of Mexico you have a two thousand mile journey of Mexico they walk through Mexico like it's walking through Central Park Mexico is doing nothing for us except taking our money and sending us drugs meanwhile NBC News has confirmed what was first reported by The Washington Post that HHS has asked the Pentagon to house upwards of 20,000 migrant children on our military bases also the Justice Department has asked a federal judge to allow the government to detain migrant families for long periods of time which brings us to Attorney General Jeff Sessions here he is speaking about the separation policy today and a few months back the American people don't like the idea that we are separating families we've never really intended to do that what we intended to do was to make sure that adults who bring children into the country are charged with the crime they've committed instead of giving that special group of adults immunity from prosecution which is what in effect we were doing if you don't want your child to be separated so with the Attorney General caught in a direct contradiction there with the president telling the story his way nothing from Congress today Speaker Paul Ryan has delayed a vote on a compromised immigration bill as they hunt for that magic majority number of 218 208 votes let's bring in our leadoff panel shall we on a Thursday night Todd Gilman Washington bureau chief for the Dallas Morning Morning News he was a pool reporter today traveling with the first lady kimberly atkins chief washington reporter for the Boston Herald and Peter Baker chief White House correspondent for the New York Times welcome to you all let's begin with the only man among you who made the trip today Todd tell us about how the trip came about to your understanding what was the stated goal of the trip and what ended up defining the day well the first lady's office told reporters traveling aboard her plane to McAllen this morning that she decided two days ago that she really wanted to see these facilities she told her husband and that he was supportive of it but that it was her idea 100% this of course was about two days after she went public on Sunday putting out a statement saying that she was not happy about the family separations the the press was assembled very secretly yesterday for this trip that that began this morning we were told by the first lady's office that secrecy was important to to protect the first lady because they didn't have time to have an advance team down there and of course all of the federal assets were you know they had their hands full but there probably was another agenda that they didn't want protestors to know exactly when and where she would pop up so this the goal of it was to put a spotlight on this policy and for the first lady to see for herself what the conditions were of at least some of these migrant children Kim looking back at the first lady's day to quote a great man was this a case of one step up and two steps back you know I don't doubt that the recent images and sounds of these children moved the first lady and that she was concerned about it and that made her go down there I think the issue over her wardrobe which sort of took over social media today is perhaps a Twitter twirl Twitter troll for reporters to seize on and so that makes me hesitant to do it I thought the most interest thing about the first lady's trip honestly was the statement she put out afterwards calling for bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform she made that called Congress she really should be making that call to her husband because the closest that Congress came to tackling immigration reform at all those efforts were completely torpedoed by President Trump and now we have a Congress that is again hamstrung on this issue and refuses to move chooses to refuse to move unless they have a bill that they are certain that the president will sign well no one is certain of what the president will do anything and so they are ceding their legislative authority to the White House and so for her after this trip to sort of place this issue on Congress Democrats and Republicans I think it was really puzzling when she's in the White House with the person who is in the biggest position to do something about this Peter Baker what's to stop this story from just dragging the way it is people are still red-hot over this at airports around the country these kinds of flash mobs form when flights arrives that activists think might be carrying children to a shelter in their area and of course these kids are now out there and a lot of them are going to remain out there a toddler can't tell you where they came from their home address their parents names or cell phone numbers yeah I know it's reminiscent of this first days of the trouble administration when they tried to put on that travel ban on mostly majority Muslim countries and there was great confusion a great deal of conflict a great deal of protest as you say at the airport sort of spontaneous people rushing to the to the airports to make their feelings known to try to express solidarity with the people who they saw were being targeted by these orders and you have a situation here where the president decided yesterday the reverse course without really having insight of how to do it and there's so many unanswered questions today you mentioned the report about 20,000 children potentially being housed in these military bases well we don't know yet whether that would include families are just unaccompanied minors we don't know yet whether they're really going to continue with the prosecutions that under the zero-tolerance policy that attorney general sessions put in place or not the Justice Department says one thing you hear a different thing from the Border Patrol so they haven't yet got their act together in this 24 hours since the president's order and it's left everybody pretty confused so Todd what's the agenda for them in the coming days it was it was hard for the president rhetorically to move the bar on Mexico I think he actually succeeded today however depends on which way you define the bar but what is their what is their plan to manage this rollout well as Peter says they really don't have their act together and I think part of the problem is that the president himself doesn't really understand how the process works he's very angry about illegal immigration he's frustrated that that we have so many migrants and it's on his watch but one of the main solutions to this would be to process these cases much more quickly and that requires a lot more immigration judges lo and behold there are legislative proposals to do just that and the president has said repeatedly this week I don't want judges people want to hire thousands of judges which is an exaggeration but I don't want judges I just don't want people coming to this country well okay you don't want judges but you also want these migrants to not have to stay in detention for extended periods of time where you have children wailing and it's a terrible PR problem so I think the president probably needs to do a little bit more homework and the people around him need to get them up to speed on what some of the the nitty-gritty solutions are to the the subproblems within this overall situation Kim I don't want people to think this is a gender-based question but so many people are still stuck on this jacket and I should share with our viewers Kim is a lot of things journalists lawyer and on the side you have had a fashion design business for years in your life so as you're talking about the jacket I'm seeing it going up the air stairs at Andrews coming down the air stairs at Andrews and the last photo in the sequence we showed was on the colonnade adjacent to the Rose Garden as the first lady was walking to the west wing where I understood she wore it in the Oval Office they say in the airline business we know you have a and air travel and we're so happy you chose us for your flight today she has a choice in jackets or say to not wear one on an 81 degree day in Washington so more than eight roll there's got to be a story here yeah I agree with you in that in the fashion industry and of course the first lady is a former model and is very aware of the fashion industry she has stylists there is no optic in the world of fashion that is accidental everything is very purposely placed so there was a purpose for that jacket it was not inadvertent the way her her spokesperson initially said perhaps the president was right perhaps it was a message to the media but I think whoever convinced her to do it or if it was her idea it was a really poor way to message before going to visit children some of whom don't know what where their parents are or if they're if they will ever see them again so whether it was a media troll a jab it wasn't an accident and it was a really unfortunate choice hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click
