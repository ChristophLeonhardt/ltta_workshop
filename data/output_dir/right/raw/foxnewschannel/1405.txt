00:00:01,622 --> 00:00:03,157
WANT THIS MORE THAN THE UNITED

2
00:00:03,157 --> 00:00:03,624
STATES.

3
00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:06,160
TRUMP HAS THE UPPER HAND DEANLT

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,795
KRATZ HAVE NO HAND.

5
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:10,764
HERE TO REACT FORMER WHITE HOUSE

THE GREAT AMERICA COMMITTEE.

11
00:00:23,177 --> 00:00:25,813
DO YOU GUYS GET ALONG.

12
00:00:25,813 --> 00:00:28,315
DO YOU THINK EVERYTHING WILL BE

13
00:00:28,315 --> 00:00:28,749
OKAY?

14
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:31,151
>> WE GOT FIRED.

15
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:32,319
A SELECT GROUP.

16
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:35,522
JESSE: YOU GOT FIRED, THEN THEY

17
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:38,625
BRING IN MAN FOR THE  *.

00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,228

MANAFORT.

20
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:44,898
>> WE ARE FIRED BUT LOYAL.

21
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:47,568
JESSE: A VERY SMALL GROUP,

22
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:48,702
HOPEFULLY GETTING SMALLER.

23
00:00:48,702 --> 00:00:51,305
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY

24
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:52,272
BRILLIANT COMMENTARY.

25
00:00:52,272 --> 00:00:55,242
>> THE LEFT WILL NEVER GIVE THIS

26
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:57,177
PRESIDENT THE CREDIT HE

27
00:00:57,177 --> 00:00:57,544
DESERVES.

28
00:00:57,544 --> 00:00:59,146
FIRST HE WASN'T GOING TO BE

29
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:00,514
PREPARED FOR THE MEETING.

30
00:01:00,514 --> 00:01:03,951
NOW HE PERSONALLY NEGOTIATED THE

31
00:01:03,951 --> 00:01:06,120
RELEASE MUCH THREE AMERICAN

32
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,722
HOSTAGES, HE GETS NO CREDIT FOR

33
00:01:08,722 --> 00:01:09,723
THAT.

34
00:01:09,723 --> 00:01:14,428
HE'S MOVING TOWARDS THE

35
00:01:14,428 --> 00:01:16,296
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN

36
00:01:16,296 --> 00:01:17,531
PENINSULA AND HE NEVER GETS

37
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:18,432
CREDIT FOR THAT.

38
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:21,935
THEY SAY HE'LL NEVER BE PREPARED

39
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:22,703
FOR THIS MEETING.

40
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:25,873
JESSE: WHY DO YOU THINK

41
00:01:25,873 --> 00:01:27,775
DEMOCRATS SIDE WITH PEOPLE LIKE

42
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:28,375
KIM JONG-UN.

43
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,011
DON'T THEY SEE THIS IS NOT SMART

44
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:31,378
POLITICS?

45
00:01:31,378 --> 00:01:32,913
>> THEY ARE SO SCARED OF THE

46
00:01:32,913 --> 00:01:33,881
PRESIDENT.

47
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:35,883
HE'S NOT A POLITICIAN IN THE

48
00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:36,650
CLASSIC SENSE.

49
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,752
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE SOUND

50
00:01:38,752 --> 00:01:40,821
BITES, THEY ARE OUT OF THE SAME

51
00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:42,022
PLAYBOOK.

52
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:43,991
THE PRESIDENT IS OPERATING OUT

53
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:46,393
OF A DIFFERENT PLAYBOOK.

54
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:48,295
IT'S A BUSINESSMAN'S PLAYBOOK.

55
00:01:48,295 --> 00:01:50,264
THEY ARE SO FEARFUL THAT HE'LL

56
00:01:50,264 --> 00:01:52,599
WIN WITH HIS NEGOTIATING STYLE

57
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:55,536
AND IT WILL CAUSE THE MAYOR WHAT

58
00:01:55,536 --> 00:01:57,971
PEOPLE TO DO WHAT THEY ARE

59
00:01:57,971 --> 00:01:59,540
ALREADY STARTING TO DO, WHY DO

60
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,676
WE NEED THESE GUYS.

61
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:05,212
JESSE: IF GOOD THINGS HAPPEN FOR

62
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:06,880
AMERICA AND DONALD TRUMP, BAD

63
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,049
THINGS HAPPEN FOR THE DEMOCRATIC

64
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:09,750
PARTY.

65
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,418
THAT'S HOW THEY SEE IT.

66
00:02:11,418 --> 00:02:13,487
THEY CAN'T ALLOW THE PRESIDENT

67
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:18,759
TO HAVE A FOREIGN POLICY

68
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,092
SUCCESS.

69
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:21,595
>> THEY HATE THIS PRESIDENT MORE

70
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:24,364
THAN THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRY.

71
00:02:24,364 --> 00:02:27,367
BUT IT'S SO TRUE.

72
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:30,804
30 YEARS OF FAILED FOREIGN

73
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:31,471
POLICY.

74
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:33,974
IT FAILED AND IT FAILED AND IT

75
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:34,474
FAILED.

76
00:02:34,474 --> 00:02:37,511
WHAT HAPPENED WAS JOHN KERRY

77
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:38,145
FAILED.

78
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:40,314
DONALD TRUMP CAME IN AND SAID I

79
00:02:40,314 --> 00:02:41,982
AM GOING DO IT DIFFERENTLY.

80
00:02:41,982 --> 00:02:44,918
NOW WE ARE SEEING SUCCESS IN

81
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:48,055
NORTH KOREA FOR THE FIRST TIME.

82
00:02:48,055 --> 00:02:50,958
JESSE: LET ME GET YOUR REACTION

83
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,961
TO JAMES COMEY.

84
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:59,900
SPYGATE HAS BLOWN INTO THE

85
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,300
ATMOSPHERE.

86
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,802
>> AS FAR AS I CAN TELL IT'S

87
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:02,469
MADE UP.

88
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:04,771
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S GETTING

89
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:05,305
THAT FROM.

90
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:06,907
>> DO YOU FIND THAT TO BE

91
00:03:06,907 --> 00:03:08,308
POSSIBLE OR PROBABLE THAT THERE

92
00:03:08,308 --> 00:03:10,878
WAS A SPY INSERTED INTO HIS

93
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:12,980
CAMPAIGN BY AN INTELLIGENCE

94
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,313
AGENCY?

95
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:15,215
>> I DON'T FIND IT POSSIBLE AND

96
00:03:15,215 --> 00:03:18,852
I KNOW IT NOT TO BE TRUE.

97
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:22,055
JESSE: MAYBE JAMES CLAPPER HAD

98
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:23,156
DIFFERENT TAKE ON THIS.

99
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:24,958
LET'S HEAR WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.

100
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,861
>> WAS THE FBI SPYING ON TRUMP'S

101
00:03:27,861 --> 00:03:28,528
CAMPAIGN.

102
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:30,163
>> NO, THEY WERE NOT.

103
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:33,033
THEY WERE SPYING ON A TERM I

104
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:35,202
DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE, WON'T

105
00:03:35,202 --> 00:03:36,203
RUSSIANS WERE DOING.

106
00:03:36,203 --> 00:03:39,239
WERE THE RUSSIANS TRYING GAIN

107
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:40,474
ACCESS AND LEVERAGE AND

108
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:41,141
INFLUENCE.

109
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:42,342
THIS IS WHAT THEY DO.

110
00:03:42,342 --> 00:03:44,912
>> WHY DOESN'T HE LIKE THAT.

111
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:47,214
HE SHOULD BE HAPPY.

112
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:48,782
EACH SHOULD BE.

113
00:03:48,782 --> 00:03:50,918
JESSE: WHO DO YOU BELIEVE, THE

114
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:53,654
LIAR OR THE LEAKER?

115
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:57,424
>> WAIT COMES DOWN TO IS JAMES

116
00:03:57,424 --> 00:03:58,992
COMEY LIED BEFORE CONGRESS SO

117
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:00,961
MANY TIMES.

118
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:02,462
HIS DEPUTY ANDREW McCABE LIED

119
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:04,765
TO THE FBI ON THREE DIFFERENT

120
00:04:04,765 --> 00:04:05,699
OCCASIONS.

121
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:08,635
CLAPPER AND BRENNAN PROBABLY

122
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:12,940
PERPETUATED THE WORST CRIME IN

123
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,807
POLITICAL AMERICAN GOVERNMENT

124
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:14,474
HISTORY.

125
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:16,476
NOW THEY ARE SCURRYING RATS.

126
00:04:16,476 --> 00:04:18,045
THEY ARE ALL POINTING THE

127
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:19,813
FINGERS AT EACH OTHER.

128
00:04:19,813 --> 00:04:22,115
THEY HAVE MANY BAD DAYS IN FRONT

129
00:04:22,115 --> 00:04:22,816
OF THEM.

130
00:04:22,816 --> 00:04:27,554
EVERY TIME THEY GO ON TELEVISION

131
00:04:27,554 --> 00:04:29,723
THEY CAN'T KEEP THEIR STORIES

132
00:04:29,723 --> 00:04:30,090
STRAIGHT.

133
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,893
JESSE: YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR

134
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:34,461
STORIES TOGETHER IF

135
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:35,896
INVESTIGATORS ARE GOING TO BE

136
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:38,465
ASKING YOU QUESTIONS.

137
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:41,234
>> HE COULD HAVE GONE IN WHEN HE

138
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:43,136
WAS A CANDIDATE AND SAID WE ARE

139
00:04:43,136 --> 00:04:44,171
WORRIED ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS AND

140
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:45,906
WE ARE GOING TO PUT PEOPLE IN

141
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:47,941
PLACE TO PICK UP RUSSIAN

142
00:04:47,941 --> 00:04:48,375
INTELLIGENCE.

143
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:52,879
THE PRESIDENT IS A TOTAL PATRIOT

144
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,147
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE WITH

145
00:04:54,147 --> 00:04:55,382
IT.

146
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:57,017
THEY WERE FEARFUL HE WAS GOING

147
00:04:57,017 --> 00:05:01,254
TO WIN, SO THEY DID ITA IN A

148
00:05:01,254 --> 00:05:04,725
WERE

149
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:04,758
-RE

150
00:05:04,758 --> 00:05:05,158
--E

151
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:15,135
--DID IT IN A SEREPTITOUS WAY.

152
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,571
>> THEY TOOK $5 MILLION OUT OF

153
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:30,417
THEIR CAMPAIGN WAR CHEST, PAID

154
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:30,951
AN.

155
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:33,286
DID THEY ALSO DO THAT WITH A

156
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:35,222
CAMPAIGN THAT PAID $5 MILLION TO

157
00:05:35,222 --> 00:05:36,823
GO TO RUSSIA?

158
00:05:36,823 --> 00:05:38,025
WE KNOW THE ANSWER NOISE.

159
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:40,160
THIS WAS THEIR INSURANCE POLICY

160
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,532
AGAINST A TRUMP SUCCESS.

161
00:05:45,532 --> 00:05:49,236
JESSE: YOU HAVE HILLARY CLINTON

162
00:05:49,236 --> 00:05:51,638
DEALING WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES

163
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:54,941
WHO DONATE MILLIONS TO HER

164
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:55,342
FOUNDATION.

165
00:05:55,342 --> 00:05:57,911
I WOULD SAY THERE IS MORE

166
00:05:57,911 --> 00:05:59,179
FOREIGN INFLUENCE INTO THE

167
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:01,415
CLINTON CAMPAIGN FROM CHINA,

168
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:03,050
MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES, FROM

169
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,152
THE RUSSIANS THAN THERE WAS FROM

170
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:07,220
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

171
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,990
>> THE NEXT MOVE WILL BE TO

172
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,591
COMPLETELY PROTECT THEM.

173
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:13,126
GOD FORBID IF ANYTHING HAPPENS

174
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:16,096
TO THEM, THERE ARE TWO BIG

175
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:17,931
DOMINOES THAT WILL KNOCK

176
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:19,132
EVERYBODY OUT.

177
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:22,035
JESSE: ALSO ANSWERING QUESTIONS,

178
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:26,139
THE NFL FINALLY HAS A POLICY

179
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:28,241
ABOUT KNEELING.

180
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:30,544
THE FANS DIDN'T LIKE THE

181
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:30,977
DISRESPECT.

182
00:06:30,977 --> 00:06:33,046
TRUMP WAS ASKED ABOUT THAT.

183
00:06:33,046 --> 00:06:35,048
CHANGE IN POLICY.

184
00:06:35,048 --> 00:06:37,184
IF THEY DO KNEEL, NOT ON THE

185
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:38,185
FIELD.

186
00:06:38,185 --> 00:06:40,120
IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

187
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,655
BRIAN KILMEADE CAUGHT UP WITH

188
00:06:41,655 --> 00:06:42,389
THE PRESIDENT.

189
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:43,190
PRESIDENT TRUMP: YOU HAVE TO

190
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,959
STAND PROUDLY FOR "THE NATIONAL

191
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,494
ANTHEM" OR YOU SHOULDN'T BE

192
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,062
PLAYING, YOU SHOULDN'T THEREBY,

193
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:50,931
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN THE

194
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:51,264
COUNTRY.

195
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:55,168
JESSE: THAT FREAKED EVERYBODY

196
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:56,169
OUT.

197
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:58,472
>> THERE ARE RULES FOR EVERY

198
00:06:58,472 --> 00:06:59,573
ORGANIZATION THAT PEOPLE WORK

199
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:00,006
FOR.

200
00:07:00,006 --> 00:07:02,242
ONE OF THE RULES ARE SIMPLE.

201
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:05,178
STAND UP AND ACKNOWLEDGE "THE

202
00:07:05,178 --> 00:07:05,679
NATIONAL ANTHEM."

203
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:07,414
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS

204
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:10,550
EVEN A CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION.

205
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,221
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RESPECT THE

206
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:18,125
FLAG THAT MEN HAVE DIED FOR.

207
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,527
DON'T PLAY A SILLY GAME WHERE

208
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:22,762
YOU MAKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

209
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:24,631
IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO PLAY THAT

210
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:28,301
GAME, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO

211
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:32,906
WILLING TO TAKE YOUR SPOT.

212
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:35,375
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY PEOPLE

213
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,577
WALKED AWAY FROM THE NFL AND THE

214
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:39,045
RATINGS WENT DOWN AND THAT

215
00:07:39,045 --> 00:07:40,580
SCARED ALL OF THEM.

216
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,883
BUT THEY ARE UP AGAINST IT WITH

217
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:44,684
THE PLAYERS' UNION.

218
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:46,820
TO ME I THINK THEY MADE THE

219
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,287
RIGHT DECISION.

220
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:50,824
I THINK THERE IS ANOTHER WAY TO

221
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:53,326
PROGRESS PEACE AND SOCIAL

222
00:07:53,326 --> 00:07:54,027
JUSTICE.

223
00:07:54,027 --> 00:07:55,962
THAT IS A GAME OF ENTERTAINMENT

224
00:07:55,962 --> 00:07:57,697
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T

225
00:07:57,697 --> 00:08:00,500
LIKE THEY ARE DOING.

226
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,770
JESSE: ONE OF THE COACHES WHO

227
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,672
DISAGREES WITH YOU HAD THIS TO

228
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:07,541
SAY ON THE NEW POLICY.

229
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:16,183
>> BASICALLY TRYING TO USE THE

230
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:17,417
ANTHEM, NATIONALISM, AIRING

231
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:20,787
PEOPLE IT'S IDIOTIC.

232
00:08:20,787 --> 00:08:23,356
I AM PROUD TO BE IN THE LEAGUE,

233
00:08:23,356 --> 00:08:25,692
BUT UNDERSTAND FATISM IN AMERICA

234
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:28,962
IS ABOUT FREE SPEECH AND

235
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:29,930
PROTESTING.

236
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,965
OUR PRESIDENT DECIDED TO MAKE IT

237
00:08:31,965 --> 00:08:33,033
ABOUT THAT.

238
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:37,770
THE NFL FOLLOWED SUIT.

239
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,707
PANDERED TO THEIR FAN BASE.

240
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:44,211
JESSE: HE'S WRONG IT'S NOT ABOUT

241
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:48,481
THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

242
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:52,352
WHEN YOU ARE AT YOUR EMPLOYER'S

243
00:08:52,352 --> 00:08:57,791
PLACE OF WORK, HE'S PAYING YOU

244
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,426
TO PLAY FOOTBALL, YOU HAVE TO DO

245
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:00,794
WHAT HE WANTS YOU TO DO.

246
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:06,566
>> THE NBA SIGNED INTO THEIR

247
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:08,401
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT

248
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:12,806
THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO STAND FOR

249
00:09:12,806 --> 00:09:13,807
"THE NATIONAL ANTHEM."

250
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:15,475
JESSE: THEY ALL STAND THERE.

251
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:17,978
SO WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

252
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:22,182
>> IT'S SIGNED CONTRACTUALLY

253
00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:23,984
INTO THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

254
00:09:23,984 --> 00:09:24,351
AGREEMENT.

255
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:26,853
>> YOU PAY A GAME, YOU MAKE A

256
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:29,155
LOT OF MONEY IT'S AN

257
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:29,789
ENTERTAINMENT THING.

258
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:33,693
YOU STAND UP, SHOW RESPECT FOR

259
00:09:33,693 --> 00:09:35,629
THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN WHICH WE

260
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:36,062
LIVE.

261
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:38,064
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO STAND FOR

262
00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:39,966
THE ANTHEM.

263
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:41,468
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

264
00:09:41,468 --> 00:09:46,172
GOOD LUCK MAKING THAT MONEY IN

265
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:46,506
ROMANIA.

266
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:49,876
JESSE: POLICE BRUTALITY AND

267
00:09:49,876 --> 00:09:52,112
RACISM IS A SERIOUS ISSUE IN

268
00:09:52,112 --> 00:09:52,912
THIS COUNTRY.

269
00:09:52,912 --> 00:09:59,452
AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS OTHER

270
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:03,757
AVENUES.

271
00:10:03,757 --> 00:10:08,128
>> MOHAMMED ALI SAID IT WAS A

272
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:09,829
WHITE MAN'S WAR AN LEFT BOXING

273
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:11,865
TO MAKE THAT PROTEST.

274
00:10:11,865 --> 00:10:14,868
I AM NOT SAYING PEOPLE SHOULD DO

275
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:17,671
THAT, I'M JUST SAYING LOOK AT

276
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:19,706
POWER AND COURAGE IT TOOK TO DO

277
00:10:19,706 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT 50 YEARS AGO.
