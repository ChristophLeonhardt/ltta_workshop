YESTERDAY THERE WAS THE NATIONAL
WALKOUT TO MEMORIAL THOSE WHO
WERE VICTIMS IN THE SHOOTING IN
PARKLAND AND ALSO TO PROTEST GUN
VIOLENCE.
ONE OF THE PARENTS OF
A STUDENT IN ARKANSAS WHO
PARTICIPATED IN THE WALKOUT
TWEETED THIS.
HER NAME IS
JERUSALEM GREER:
CORPORAL PUNISHMENT IS STILL A
THING IN SCHOOLS.
IT IS
OUTLAWED IN 31 STATES.
IT IS
STILL OKAY IN 19 STATES, PER
THE WASHINGTON POST.
I THINK
THAT IS A STAT FROM A FEW
YEARS AGO.
THEY ARE CALLED
SWATS.
THAT IS A PROGRAM THAT
HE WAS ADMINISTERED.
SWATS ON
THE THIGH WITH A PADDLE.
HERE
IS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE
POLICY:
CORPORAL PUNISHMENT 
IS STILL A
THING.
HOW OLD ARE THE STUDENTS?
HIGH SCHOOL?
THE IMAGE OF A HIGH SCHOOL
STUDENT GETTING SLAPPED OR
SWATTED, IT IS MIND-BOGGLING TO
ME.
AND ALLOWING THEMSELVES TO
BE.
I WONDER WHAT THE OTHER OPTION
WAS?
THE OTHER THING WAS A TWO DAY
IN SCHOOL SUSPENSION.
HE IS
LIKE, LET'S JUST GET IT OVER
WITH.
THEY ARE HARD-CORE.
THE STUDENTS ARE WONDERFULLY
BRAVE.
HE WAS THE FIRST
ONE TO WALK OUT, THIS PARTICULAR
GUY.
LET ME GIVE YOU HIS NAME.
WILEY A. GREER.
HE SAID WHEN HE STOOD UP TO WALK
OUT ON THE DAY
THERE WERE GASPS IN
THE CLASSROOM AND EVERYONE
WAS LOOKING AT HIM LIKE, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?
BECAUSE LOOK, IN OUR BUBBLE, IN
A BIG CITY LIKE L.A., A LOT
OF PEOPLE ARE LIBERAL.
IF
YOU DO NOT WALK OUT PEOPLE
LOOK AT YOU KIND OF FUNNY LIKE,
YOU WANT GUNS IN SCHOOL?
ARE YOU A WEIRDO?
OVER THERE WALKING OUT IS A
HUGE SIGN OF COURAGE AND HE
SAID HE WENT OUT AND THEN HE SAT
ON THE PARK BENCH IN FRONT
OF THE SCHOOL AND HE WAS LIKE,
IS ANYBODY GOING TO JOIN ME?
HE SAID FINALLY TWO OTHER KIDS
CAME OUT AND HE SAID THEY WERE
THE TWO SMARTEST KIDS IN THE
SCHOOL.
THAT WAS MY FAVORITE
PART OF THE STORY.
I ALSO LOVED THAT THAT
STUDENT SAID THAT HE WAS
CONFOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT
HIS SCHOOL'S ADMINISTRATORS
WOULD MEET A PROTEST OF GUN
VIOLENCE WITH MORE
VIOLENCE, CORPORATE VIOLENCE.
AND NOT MY WORDS BUT HIS, BUT I
JUST THOUGHT I WAS VERY
POWERFUL.
SO GREAT, MAN.
HE COULD HAVE
TAKEN IN SCHOOL SUSPENSION.
IF
I, KEEPING IT REAL, I WOULD
MUCH RATHER TAKE THE SWATS THAN
THE TWO DAYS OF IN SCHOOL
SUSPENSION WHICH IS LIKE
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, YOU LOSE
YOUR MIND IN THERE AND I HAVE A
HIGH THRESHOLD FOR PAIN, BUT OF
COURSE THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE
CORPORAL PUNISHMENT, WE SHOULD
NOT BE SWATTING PEOPLE WITH A
PADDLE AND LUCKILY THERE ARE
SOME RULES AND REGULATIONS AND
SO THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER ADULT
PRESENT WHICH, THAT WAS AMAZING.
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS
PADDLING?
I WANT TO
MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS SAFE HERE
BUT HE SAID HE TOOK THE
PUNISHMENT TO MAKE A POINT ABOUT
THE VIOLENCE.
IT WAS NOT JUST
THAT HE PREFERRED THE SWATTING.
HE SAYS NO,
CORPORAL PUNISHMENT
SHOULDN'T EXIST IN THE SCHOOL
SO HE TOOK IT FOR THE POINT.
DON'T YOU THINK IT IS SO
HYPOCRITICAL AND BACKWARD OF ANY
SCHOOL THAT IS TRYING TO TEACH
KIDS HOW TO THINK CRITICALLY AND
WON'T ALLOW THEM TO DO SOMETHING
THAT IS PART OF THE NATIONAL
CONVERSATION?
THAT IS WHAT A LOT
OF PARENTS THINK AND I BACK THEM
UP ON IT IS LIKE, IF I HAD A KID
AT THAT AGE, I WOULD SAY STAND
UP FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN, BUT
YOU BETTER BE ABLE TO DEFEND IT,
DON'T JUST DO IT BECAUSE YOUR
FRIENDS ARE DOING IT, DO IT
BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND WHY AND
ISN'T THAT WHAT SCHOOLS ARE FOR?
IT'S JUST SO WEIRD WITH THAT
MOMENT HAS TO BE LIKE WHEN YOU
WERE IN THE PRINCIPALS OFFICE
AND YOU ARE LIKE IN TROUBLE AND
SOMEONE COMES OUT WITH A PADDLE.
THE IDEA THAT LIKE, I
UNDERSTAND
THE IMPULSE TO HAVE TWO PEOPLE
AROUND, BUT THAT MEANS THAT
THERE IS SOMEONE IN THIS ROOM
WHERE A KID IS GETTING BEATEN
JUST TO WATCH.
WHAT?
WHO VOLUNTEERED FOR THAT?
OH, YOU ARE PADDLING THE
STUDENTS?
I WILL BE THE WITNESS.
THE
OTHER REGULATION IS IT CAN'T BE
EXCESSIVE, AGAIN, PADDLE, AND
THAT IT CAN'T BE DONE WITH ANY
MALICE.
YOU ARE HITTING A KID ON THE
THIGH, YEAH, HE SAID ENDED
UP NOT HURTING, THE PRINCIPAL
THE QUOTED, HIS STATEMENT, HE
WAS LIKE, IT IS NOT ALWAYS LIKE
THAT.
THE PRINCIPAL WAS LIKE SOMETIMES
IT HURTS MORE, BE THANKFUL
OR LIKE IT IS SUPPOSED TO
HURT MORE.
I WISH I COULD DO IT AGAIN, BUT
I CAN'T ACT WITH MALICE.
WAS THE PRINCIPAL
BEING LIKE WINK, WINK I GOT
YOU, I'M ON YOUR SIDE,
SORT OF THING?
YOU CAN'T TELL BUT THAT WAS
MY READING OF IT.
TO BE FAIR TO THE PRINCIPAL
HE SAID THAT HE RESPECTED THE
ADULTS, THEY DID NOTHING WRONG
AND THEY ARE PUT IN THIS
AWKWARD SITUATION WHERE THE
PRINCIPAL HAS TO COME OUT
AND TELL THE KIDS WHEN THEY ARE
DOING THE WALKOUT, DO
UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCE OF
YOUR ACTIONS?
AND EXPLAIN THAT YOU ARE GOING
TO GET BEAT FOR THIS OR
SWATTED FOR THIS.
I GOT THE
SENSE FROM WILEY'S LETTER
THAT THE PRINCIPLE WAS LIKE
OKAY, BUT THE NEXT TIME IT
MIGHT ACTUALLY HURT.
EVEN IF THE PRINCIPAL WAS NOT
THAT WAY, IT IS A GREAT WAY TO
DEFAME WHAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A
CRITICISM OF HIM WHICH IS LIKE,
HE DOES NOT LIKE HIS PRINCIPAL.
HE WAS LIKE, THE PRINCIPAL WAS
ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT
WAS, WE WERE ALL PROFESSIONALS
THERE AND MEANWHILE I AM 16.
HE IS SO MUCH GRACE IN HIS
LETTER THAT HE WROTE FOR THE
SCHOOL OFFICIALS AND NOT TO
MINIMIZE WHAT WILEY AND ALL
THESE OTHER STUDENTS HAVE DONE
BECAUSE IT IS SO COURAGEOUS, BUT
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK THROUGH
HISTORY AND THE WAY THE HISTORY
HAVE CHANGED THE COURSE OF
HISTORY THROUGH WALKOUTS AND
PROTESTS, THE CONSEQUENCES THAT
STUDENTS TODAY
ARE FACING ARE DIFFERENT,
MARKEDLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT
THEY FACED WHEN THE KKK MIGHT'VE
TARGETED YOU WHEN YOU WERE
MARCHING IN YOUR SCHOOL AND
TRYING TO FIGHT FOR
DESEGREGATION
OR INTEGRATION IN THE SCHOOLS,
SO AGAIN, NOT TO MINIMIZE WHAT
THE STUDENTS HAVE DONE, BUT JUST
TO SHOW HOW POWERFUL THESE
STATEMENTS CAN BE AND HOW MUCH
CHANGE IF THEY CAN REALLY
AFFECT WHEN YOU LOOK BACK
THROUGH TIME.
AND OF COURSE, PROBABLY THE
MOST FAMOUS INSTANCE OF
FIGHTING AGAINST SEGREGATION WAS
IN ARKANSAS AS WELL.
