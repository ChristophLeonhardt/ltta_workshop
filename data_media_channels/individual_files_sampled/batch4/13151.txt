the United Nations has taken time off from sending peacekeepers to enslave women in the Congo and abuse children on the Ivory Coast and run prostitute rings in Bosnia to warn us all that climate change is going to destroy the world again the UN's Committee on screaming over unbelievable disasters or unsound has announced that because of climate change we must dismantle capitalism worldwide where everyone will die if we do dismantle capitalism everyone will still die but they'll die with a lot less money the UN says that because of climate change there will soon be heat waves rain storms and floods these will be much worse than the heat waves rain storms and floods we have now because there'll be no capitalism so everyone will be poor now you can see why climate change is so bad now many people have grown dubious with predictions of climate disaster because they're simply tired of Al Gore dressed in nothing but a towel chasing masseuses around his hotel room screaming the world is going to end so touch me now but the UN says their latest prediction of disaster is much worse than their previous predictions of disaster because they are predicting a much worse disaster so when it doesn't happen it'll be much worse than the other disasters that didn't happen in the past still there can be little doubt that the climate is changing and that everyone will die in a spectacular fiery Cataclysm just as soon as one of these climate predictions turns out to be correct how can we avoid this horrifying yet visually stunning faint well the models show that if we get rid of all fossil fuels within four years we could actually stave off the apocalypse then we would be able to proudly tell our great grandchildren we've saved the planet so you can live horrible primitive lives in a socialist hellscape or we can say screw it and let the little Rugrats fend for themselves now for that trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right we're back in

so you want to do that right away and we will get your to your questions tomorrow so everybody is talking about the Cavanaugh effect what effect will the nominated confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court what effect will that have on the midterms and the answer is we don't know it really does seem that it has scrambled everything that people are going to be voting on whether they want you know to be governed by mob rule and anybody who gets accused is guilty or whether they want the rule of law in the Constitution that so that's essentially what you'll be voting for is your vote whether to to support Trump Trump's Republican Party or the Democrats but the one thing we do know about the Kavanaugh fact we do know that it has driven the left in saying they have lost the plot of America they are acting like absolute crazy people Trump is actually running on this now if you would go to cut for and you can hear he is playing this up to the hill Mike rats have become totally unhinged they're gonna think I'm crazy now they've got crazy but the Democrats have become too extreme and they become frankly too dangerous to govern and they become a mob and this is the thing they have become a mob it's not just the people who were banging on the Supreme Court doors it's the people who were chasing some of them paid for by George Soros who were chasing senators down the halls the guys who cut cornered the women who cornered Jeff Flake in the elevator paid for agents by Jeff by George Soros that's mob behavior chasing Ted Cruz out of restaurants mob behavior surrounding the home Homeland Security lady in the movie theaters around the ER and spitting at her and shouting at her and bullying or that's mob behavior the left the Democrat mob does not like to be called a Democrat mob and there's a reason for this the reason is they're a Democrat mob and so the Democrat mob does not like being called out so of course who do they call upon to run interference for them the media so MRC one of our favorite websites News Buster's put out a montage of the dint of the media standing up against the idea that a mob is a mob here it is when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out of restaurants by a mob totally a mob it is without a doubt there's no other word it's a stop mr. Trump accused Democrats of using mob tactics he says the Democrats are an angry Brandin Democrats as an angry mob Democrats and the woman mom David a mob mob just this angry mob mob mob mob mob mob mob mob mob and then to call the mob the mob the mob on the Left Democratic mob the mob the mobs part of an angry mob an angry mob he says what about the people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the walls what do you call that the subjugated majority in this country and they're being made out to be violent and disruptive I mean it really wasn't a mob accusing the left of being this angry wild mob is just ridiculous describing protesters as a mob doesn't fit the facts and it's really funny because Trump loves mob his talk of a mob rule and so on I mean rook have you have you been to a trump rally Donald Trump over the weekend called them a mob and compared them to arsonists calling liberals the angry dangerous mob and this is a actually a tactic that Hitler yeah well if you wait long enough they get they Hitler Hitler was just sit up in his grave and bump his head against his coffin every time although I guess he wasn't going to golf but that but there it is yeah you know what I love about this is like if it walks like a mob talks like a mob sounds like I'm up it's a mob and you know Don Lemon who is a just a lemonhead Don Lemon was saying oh well it's not you know we have a constitutional right to go into a restaurant and harass a senator no you actually don't that is not what free speech is that is not how free people behave it is absolutely not within the realm of free speech to go screaming at people to DOX them to so that people go to their houses it is absolutely mob rule and they're encouraging it you know we played Hillary Clinton the other day say you know we can't be civil anymore until we win well I but you know we don't want to be civil when we're out of power we you know they when we were out of power that's when we become uncivil Eric Holder we got to stop for a minute Eric Holder is obviously thinking of running for president this is former attorney general under Barack Obama only attorney general in the history of the United States be held in contempt of Congress for what it was because when they got he got caught out and investigated for running a for running guns essentially the Fast and Furious operation in which they allowed Mexican gangsters to buy guns because they were gonna trace the guns that was the idea they were gonna trace the guns and it got they just lost the guns and the Mexican gangsters got the guns while the feds were sitting there watching them and finally a border agent was killed by this so they investigated he refused to hand over the documents so they could see it and Barack Obama refused to have the Justice Department investigate him and prosecute him for contempt of Congress because he claimed it was he was protecting executive privilege the old Bill Clinton trick like everybody from his mother to his cook had executive privilege under Clinton because he didn't want to admit this you know I got a lot of feedback about the max boot interview that I did have never Trump or max boot and you know there were two people two kinds of feedback I got one was why did you play that why did you let him say those stupid things and the other was I'm glad you let him say those two good things so I could hear them but the one thing that what everybody found incredible was his idea that Barack Obama was somehow a great honest guy who didn't violate the Constitution which is my big argument that Trump for all they yell about him and all his his rudeness in his strange sometimes behavior he hasn't violated constitutional governance at all and Obama did it routinely he transformed the government into a Democrat machine like in Chicago so here's Eric Holder telling people what he wants them to do they have used the power that they have gotten for all the wrong things they want to keep themselves in power they want to cater to the special interests it is time for us as Democrats to be as tough as they are to be as dedicated as they are to be as committed as they are Michelle always says Michelle Byrom I love her you know she and my wife like really tight which scares me abrupt says you know when they go low we go no they go low we kick when they go low we kick them and that you know and people are encouraging they're encouraging people to basically attack you know congressman's senators who was it was Cory Booker played Cory Booker is Spartacus telling people they should go after people in get up in the faces of Congress people please don't just come here today and then go home go to the hill today get up and please get up in the face of some Congress people yeah so I mean there it's you can't say it's not a mob when you're encouraging people to be a mob you don't see Donald Trump Donald Trump arrives up his base there's no question about it but he doesn't rile them up to violence he doesn't rile him up to attack people he never said that he never said go kick him I mean during when he was campaigning I used to rail at him against this when he was campaigning he sometimes skirted the edge and it really bugged me and it bugs me still that he did it but since he's become president he hasn't been doing that and they are they have become his worst self as I always say Trump at his worst is the Democrats that's why they hate him but more important than this more important than the model is the fact that what they are fighting for what the left is actually fighting for is to destroy constitutional governance I mean one of the things that I keep saying about you know people say well Donald Trump had all these you know women who said he did these nasty things well all of the women who accused them they accused them of things that were creepy mischief you know putting his hands where he shouldn't have put him of looking up their skirts when they were walking above and that kind of thing kind of you know creepy stuff but but not assault they didn't only his ex-wife during a divorce proceeding accused him of really raping her and then said no that was the lawyers talking it was just part of the divorce settlement everything but the thing is he was running against and this was another disagreement I had with boot he was running against a career criminal a woman who was you know he listened to Ken's star talk about her he was on this close to going after her for perjury after her testimony she stonewalled everybody but a career criminal who openly did not support the first and second amendment she openly did not support the Heller decision which said this second amendment guarantees your personal right to bear arms and she didn't support the Citizens United decision which said which basically supported your right to to have political speech I mean it was the First Amendment this is what they're going after listen to some of the stuff that they've been saying and Milhiser who is George Soros guy from the the site Think Progress so he is the Justice editor there and he writes this piece after Cavanaugh gets confirmed the Constitution of the United States has failed and this thing is amazing it is just like a it is really like a 19 year old who's just read that idiot to Howard Zinn and he's like wow you know sometimes bad things happened in America it's not all good and so he hates America and he says Americans speak of our Constitution as if it were a religious text to label a law unconstitutional is not simply to say that it violates some procedural rule or legal technicality it is to label it fundamentally an American he has a problem with this this is exactly right it is fundamental yet on America but our Constitution has not served us nearly as well as we would have been served by other systems adopted by our pure nations in other words in Europe and Scandinavia all of which live at are under our protection under our umbrella using our machines our innovation our financial security all of which are essentially client states of this great country and none of them would even exist at the level of diversity and freedom that they exist in if it weren't for our inspiration which gave it their their first the first birth of free of true freedom on the planet so his complaints the electoral college allows people he disagrees with to get elected he doesn't like that in the electoral college the Trump did not have a popular majority though he would have had be he been running in a popular election he would have run his campaign differently it would haven't won that way and he doesn't like the fact that you can't distribute well if it were just guys like him just George Soros radical hacks like him that would be one thing but MSNBC you know wherever Lawrence stop the hammering o'donnell you know he's over there complaining about the electoral college too he's there is stop the amory he wants to stop while he's stopping the hammer and he wants to stop the Electoral College he tweeted out the founders design flaw and democracy the electoral college and he wants to get rid of the Senate two Senators per state no matter what size or population and that you know stop this constitutional stuff in Alexandria Google eyes Cortes you know that no nothing I mean talk about a woman every time she opens her mouth she I think she may actually lose one of the most democratic districts in the country but she tweeted out it's well past time we eliminate the Electoral College a shadow of slavery's power on America today so what is it they're saying that Senate the Electoral College it gives power to the states it means that if you live in Wisconsin what a great state by the way I was just there what a beautiful beautiful town Madison is what nice people with great food but they the left does not want them having the same power as the people in California and the people in New York because that's them and they hate you they hate the rest of the country they hate the people who don't think like them and they think because they they are so righteous they should have the right to reach out from LA which knows nothing about Madison which knows nothing about Arkansas which knows nothing about Tennessee they should be able to reach out and tell those people how to live and that's why they keep going back to Democrat institutions like slavery and Jim Crow because there are times there were times when states rights was used to defend bigotry that's that is true they're right about that but there was all Democrats it was all Democrats doing that now that it's Republicans we don't have that problem they're just trying to live the way they want to live in their locality not the way you want them to live in your locality and they despise them and if you don't think they despise them listen to the way you know if they're obviously they're racist about white people they have this they've used words like white male as a pejorative which is the sky I just find that disgusting if I use the word blackmail as a they'd come in here Shapiro would come in here and drag me out I mean they're like that no seriously nobody on the right things like this nobody on the right wants to think like this nobody respectable on the right I'm not talking about that people who go nuts in the comment sections I'm talking about the mainstream but the mainstream of the left is talking about whites as if that's somehow wrong but then if you're black if you're Kanye listen to the way they talked about Kanye on the lemon show there's a number eight Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read and and we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it and pervert it and he's gonna have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures listen black folks are about to trade Kanye West and the racial draft okay they've had it with him he's not that well I do i do know that reference I know that that is an old Dave Chappelle skit I know I mean listen to that they they're ejecting Kanye regalia's gonna have lunch with the president today and of course it isn't working it's only it only is working because black people under Trump are doing great you know the economy is great jobs are their record low unemployment and the white guy Jesse Lee Peterson said the white guy was a coward Jesse Lee just doesn't hold back you know I love that's why I love him that he just says we si but he should have said you know this is racism they eject you from their identity groups if you don't agree with them anyway that's the Kavanaugh fact the Cavanaugh effect is driving them nuts I think it's going to be good for us in the midterms this is not a crazy country this is not a radical country while we're talking about the thing thing the way this country isn't however we really have to go back and follow this Jamal Khashoggi case which is just getting uglier and uglier it sir saying that a 15 Saudis this is the he's a Washington Post columnist he lived in Virginia he was possibly Lord to Turkey he said he wanted to get divorce papers he went to Turkey and went into the Saudi consulate there and vanished he's vanished without a trace the Turks say he has been assassinated cut to pieces and thrown out this is bad this is bad stuff what's what is wonderful however what is a good the good part of this if I can say that is that the we Americans are united right and left in calling for action on this and not letting this pass you cannot let a Washington Post columnist be killed by our putative allies are supposed to they're supposed to be our allies the Saudis are supposed to be reforming here is both Chuck Schumer and Lindsey Graham talking about it well it's despicable and the whole world is watching you know the crown prince is portraying himself as a reformer who's trying to improve and open up Saudi society reformers don't kill their political opponents I've never been more disturbed than them right now if this did in fact happen if this man was murdered and the Saudi consulate in Istanbul they have across every line of normality in the international community if it did happen they would be hell to pay if they're this brazen it shows contempt contempt for everything that we stand for contempt for the relationship and I don't want a prejudge but if it goes down the road that I'm worried about it going down and content will be met with contempt and and don't forget I mean this is very complicated because the Saudis are supposed to be our pals and Jared Kushner has been you know cozying up to them hoping they'll help with peace in the Middle East but this is also happening with Putin and the Russians you know they reached out this guy Nikolai glushko if this was on the front page of The Wall Street Journal God loved them for doing it he was one of these Russian oligarchs who raped the Soviet Union after a collapse and escaped and then was fell out of thought a favor with Putin and he was on trial and the trial was going to embarrass Vladimir Putin by showing parts of history they didn't like and he was found a strangled to death with his dog's leash and Putin says oh well it was a homosexual killing Putin always blames the gays always blames the Jews I mean this is this is his big trick that he uses you know this is the third one of these emigres Russians to be murdered by obviously by Putin it seems to me in England we cannot let this stuff go on we have to call it out and do not listen to the people hammering Trump about this Maggie Haberman the Clinton hack was over at the New York Times she tweeted out that somebody shouted at Trump you know what wasn't this Khashoggi journalists killed because you said that journalists are the enemy of the people no and they're saying oh he's gonna sweep this under the rug no he's not I mean this set cannot stand this cannot stand and it is good to see Americans uniting over this it is good to see Schumer joining with Lindsey Graham because clearly the left has forgotten what America is about in America but let's not forget what they are about in the rest of the world so it is good hey you know this some of this stuff is causing Democrats to wake up because there are only two parties Republicans and Democrats and one of them has lost the plot of the country one of them has forgotten what this country is about and that is why I really you know have come to support Trump why so many never never Trump errs have come around he is defending the country as it stands he is not always a person I like but he is always a person so far who has stood up for constitutional governance Brendan Brandon Streck it is made this video saying he was walking away he was a gay liberal and he wanted to walk away from the left which he said and he started to encourage people to walk away and he has started a movement and he is organizing a walk away March in Washington DC for October 27th and we had him on the show and talked about him a really entertaining guy in an entertaining interview this is October 27th the walk away March and here is Brandon struck ah Brandon struck thank you very much for coming on thank you so let's let's start at the beginning what what is it that made you walk away in the first place made you make this walk away video well I had been watching for years as I felt like the ideology of liberalism was becoming more and more kind of toxic and intolerable and so I was already starting to feel sort of pushed away and isolated and you know kind of turned off by that and then but it was really after the election of Donald Trump that you know I voted for Hillary and I was really really devastated that Donald Trump had been elected because I believe the liberal media I mean I was I was an ardent follower of the liberal media and so when they said things like he was you know racist a bigot and not see the second coming of Hitler I I really thought that we were in a lot of danger I mean I really really believe them and so it wasn't until you know I was going on social media and like ranting and raving and asking all these people you know I grew up in Nebraska and I was like why did you people vote for him like what were you thinking what's wrong with you and and then finally somebody this woman who used to babysit me when I was a baby got in touch with me and she she prevent presented me with a YouTube video which was a compilation of footage showing the ways in which the liberal media had taken moments out of context and isolated them and spun a narrative and you know and basically if you watch the entirety of you know these different clips or see these moments in proper context what the media was leading us to believe wasn't true at all huh and I mean I feel a little bit like an idiot sitting here telling you this today because it's so obvious the kind of thing that once you see it you can't ever unsee it you know I'm like what how did I miss this but you know I'm not alone millions and millions of people are falling for what the liberal media is telling them and that was really what happened to me you know I had this almost the exact same experience I'm a lot older I had it with Reagan because I have the I was same thing right down the line liberal believe the media and then everything he did worked and I thought something is wrong here so ya know that's that so you you put out you put out a video were you shocked when it became as popular as it was hmm I don't you know I like at anytime I do something I like to dream really big and kind of you know dream for this shoot for this shoot for the moon you know and so I didn't know what would happen obviously I had no idea and I definitely contemplated the possibility that I would put this video out and maybe 50 people would ever see it and those would be the 50 people who would for the my life would be in charge of telling you know whether or not I got a job or a place to live or you know these would be like all my future bosses but um no I mean I had hoped that it would be as successful as it has been and and so but that's I'm absolutely amazed and I'm you know so touched that it has had this effect on people have you gotten any pushback I mean I know I know you said once you were a few service in a store but has yeah has it gone beyond that hmm I don't know if it's gone beyond that I mean there's there's sort of different categories of hate that one receives so there's definitely the you know being denied service in the store hate there's the hate where the people who are your friends since elementary school reach out to you and say that they're going to go to the media and tell horrible things about you to people they're the people who use that you know I I'm almost four years sober so there are people who love to say that you know go on social media and say that I'm doing drugs or that I'm drinking and you know I mean you name it but yeah to answer your question yes there has been pushback yeah I mean the viciousness of the left almost confirms what you're you're talking about it you do you it does do you find now that I mean obviously you must be falling in with some evil conservatives like me do you find do you find them to be a different breed of people I really do yeah I mean I really really do I mean for for a number of reasons first of all there's there's the aspect of conservatives I find can even disagree with each other yeah you know not not just disagree with liberals but disagree with each other and still be okay you know and still not feel the need to you know burn somebody's house down or you know push them out a window or blow up their car you know there's that but also I just feel that in general what it means to be a Republican or conservative has changed I mean I think that I'm finding that the Republican Party which is where I consider myself to be now is very inclusive it's becoming more and more diverse we're seeing now that african-american support for Trump just one year goes at 15% now it's over 35% you're welcome no but you know it's you know I just I think that things are changing and opening up you know and so that's why I was a liberal years ago you know in the first place is because I felt like that's where the tolerance the diversity the inclusion was but you know what it really is what what I see so clearly now is that they are they're diverse and they're tolerant in the most superficial of ways what they really care about is what is the color of your skin what is you know are you a different religion that I mean they it's all about the appearance of you know but it's like when it actually comes to diversity of thought or diversity of actual belief or not so much they it's one it's a one-way road yep I know I find this too I mean I always tell people I became a conservative because I'm a liberal because I believe into an actual diversity what about on the issue of gays I mean this is still place where I get I get a lot of flack for my openness of to gay life and and my feeling that people should be whatever they are if you find you get are you getting pushback from conservatives there mm-hmm not at all not at all no I mean no not at all and to be honest like I'm not being at all exaggerative or hyperbolic when I say I at this point I've gotten tens of thousands of messages from people all over the world and definitely all over the country most of them conservatives saying you know how much this movement means to them how much my speaking out and stepping forward means to them and many of them I mean out of all of those messages I've maybe received two or three from somebody who's just like a total knucklehead who says something really stupid you know something you know like love what you're doing don't support you being gay I'm like okay but the majority the majority of the people who read honest honest to god like maybe three I've gotten like that but the 99.99999% of them are people who I mean even people who don't understand it and don't really get it I you know sometimes I'll get messages for someone who's people say I'm an 87 year old straight woman from Iowa I don't understand what being gay means but I don't care I love you I think what you're doing is amazing thank you so much for standing up for our country this has been my experience among conservatives too I mean I find them the most tolerant open-hearted people on earth by and large I mean as you get your knuckleheads but not as many as you would get I you you're having a March is that correct that's correct yes tell me about that when is this okay so it's the walk away march on Washington it's a weekend law it's a March weekend we're doing on October 26th through the 28th so what we're doing is on Friday night October 26 we're having a really nice gala dinner which is still sort of in the works but that's probably probably going to be at the Trump International Hotel we anticipate having very big-name speakers and you know different kind of package levels at which people can be you know VIP dinner or just regular admission dinner on Saturday October 27th will be the March and the rally we will be marching from the DNC to our nation's capitol we will quite literally be walking away from the Democratic Party we will assemble in front of our nation's capital at the same spot as the inaugurations have been held we will be having again an amazing rally with incredible speakers some high-profile conservative voices will be stepping up to talk and address our nation right before the midterm elections but also you know I want to make clear the walkaway campaign is really about giving a voice to the people and it's about giving the power the the voice and the acknowledgement back to the people so we'll also be having everyday Americans who have amazing walkaway stories to tell well let them step up and have the mic for a bit too to address the American people and and then on Sunday October 28th we'll have our closing brunch and give people the day to travel back home so now that Trump has been in office I don't know what it feels like about 15 years but I think there's only two how do you feel about how do you feel about what he's doing oh I think he's amazing I think he's amazing yeah yeah I do i i i can't wait to vote for him in 2020 because of course i didn't vote for him in 2016 and so sadly I'll only have the opportunity to get to pull that lever one time but but I think he's doing an amazing job I mean I think the numbers speak for themselves I think the confidence that Americans are feeling speaks for itself it's really only the people who are running around you know with tinfoil on their heads screaming I mean it's really only those people that are unhappy and I you know I would I feel for them but it's like you know at the same time I'm like honey pick a xanax everything's fine well as you go forward what what are you hoping to see you I mean when you're talking about talking about actual things like policy actual things and you'd like to see in the happen in the country what are you hoping for well what I'm really hoping for particularly going forward with the walk away campaign is I want to see more and more well more people in general but particularly minorities begin to open their eyes and see that they have been lied to and used and manipulated by the democratic party and that they don't really care about them they are manipulating them and they are using them and that you know I always say walk away is a journey not a destination now I happen to find myself in the Republican Party but I don't tell people where to go or what to think I don't encourage people to leave groupthink and come into more group thing all I say is take a look at what's going on to the left take a look at what's going on in the Democratic Party really do your research and and and look at the history of this party is it deeply steeped in racism it's deeply steeped and divisive miss and these days the liberal media doesn't know they're the truth from a hole in their heads I don't know if that made any sense they wouldn't know the truth if it bit them in the in the you know what so it's like they need to take a look at these things and see what's going on I want to encourage more minorities to walk away and something that really concerns me I'd like to say really fast because I want to try to get this message out as much as possible going forward because it's something I've recently discovered and it's I'm very concerned about it I believe that what the Democratic Party is going there their next tactic is going to be because they seem to be pushing more and more for this far left socialist sort of communist platform I you know they're even starting to run these Democratic socialists very openly I mean that's what you know I think that what they're going to do is find candidates who anywhere they can find them who are black Hispanic gay transgender run them on this extremely fringe left socialist platform and their tactic their strategy is going to be that when people object to this platform they're going to say it's because they're transphobic or homophobic or racist so they are intentionally going to run minorities on this platform so that they can use their minority status to help push that socialist platform and excuse anyone else of being a bigot who objects to it and what I'm even more concerned about is that black people and gay people and transgender people are going to think that they have to be socialists because they're gay or because they're transgender this concerns me a lot and so I want to make sure that we give voices out to these communities these racial minority communities the LGBT community to let them know you don't have to be a socialist and you don't have to be a Democrat you don't have to be a liberal there is room for you on the right in the middle anywhere else just get out of there mmm no it's really interesting I think that is a strategy they've been using for years Brenda Strack thank you very much for coming on and I wish you luck with the March thank you so much that's October 27th in Washington DC is the walk away March do it listen before we get to the tickety-boo news I've got to play this thing I've never seen this before this is Gil Fulbright honest politician hi I'm Gil Fulbright the people who run my campaign they've made this commercial and I'm in it this campaign is not about me it's about crafting a version of me that will appeal to you a version of visits random work sites with paid actors pointing at things a version of me that doesn't find old people loathsome or pointless as a conventionally attractive yet curiously still family listening to my constituents legislating these are things I don't do what I do is spend about 70 percent of my time raising funds for re-election I'd do anything to stay in office my name's Gil Fulbright but hell I'll change my name to Phil golbright or Bill fulbrighter fill my mouth with parts these are the things that are important to me and these are the fine people that finance my campaign now in order to do these things I have to stay in office and stay in office I have to keep these guys happy now any of these things make these guys unhappy well my hands are tied so come November the choice is clear do you want another spineless mouthpiece for special interests and lobbyists or a spineless mouthpiece for special interest in lobbyists I'm Phillip a mouth with farts and I approve this message it's really funny actor Frank Rizzoli playing evil fulbright the ominous mullet is the only honest Pollak all right tickety-boo news all right the Atlantic Monthly to my shock ran a piece by a stone left winger every it's just the opening of this piece is so obnoxious but the meat of the piece comes from a report that was recently published called hidden tribes a study of America's polarized landscape and the study was written by more in common an organization that was founded in memory of Joe Cox the British MP was murdered in the rump to the brexit referendum she was a part of me a Labour politician was murdered by far-right lunatic and they put out this report a query report 25% of Americans are traditional or devoted conservatives okay 25% 8% of Americans are progressive activists and they are absolutely outside of the mainstream okay two-thirds of Americans who don't belong to either far right or far left or I don't know conservative or left wing crazies uh-huh are they call them an exhausted majority they are exhausted with the battle between both sides so that's 80 percent right - I'm sorry two-thirds so that's 66 percent there they're members share according to this report share a sense of fatigue with our polarized national conversation a willingness to be flexible in their political viewpoints and a lack of voice in the national conversation notice by the way that my estimate that 70 percent of people agree with 70 percent of the thing turns out to be actually almost exactly right as is almost exactly right but here listen to this most members of the exhausted majority and then some dislike political correctness they all hate political correctness among the general population 80 percent believe the political correctness is a problem in our country young people seventy-four percent ages 24 to 29 79 percent under age 24 everybody hates political correctness whites are slightly less likely than average to believe the political correctness is a problem in the country 79 percent of them share the sentiment Asians 82 percent Hispanics 87 percent and American Indians 88 percent who are most likely to oppose political correctness ever it's somebody says it seems that every day you wake up something has changed you say Jew or Jewess is a black i afro-american you're on your toes because you never know what to say political correctness in that sense is scary and it is scary because you can lose your job and so forth what I'm telling you is because all these people who apologize the minute they get caught out saying something politically correct all these corporations that fold all these spokesmen all these artists who come on their knees as if they're at a Stalinist show trial with a sign saying thought-criminal you know every one of them they're all playing to the minority every single one of them what does that mean it means for those of us who believe in the Constitution those of us who believe in freedom those of us who believe in that America is a great country and can be greater still if we can remain free all of us we are in the majority we are the majority and those of us who believe that law should not that our time sorry in culture should not be restrained restricted by political correctness you know there was an article in The Times about this the guy saying that he's getting an attack for disliking something that was done by a black guy what could because it was done by a black guy everybody hates it everybody hates it this is one more reason why you should celebrate this clayvin full
