but do you believe in for a particular vocation meaning do you think there is a particular calling by God for each person pertaining to whether they should marry what they should do for work etc yes I mean I think that your skillset generates a personality generates certain choices in life and I think that all of us are tailored for particular choices and how we act in accordance with those choices you can make us happier or less happy so if you have a skill set that is tailored for one profession and you have an aptitude for that profession to liking for that profession we like another one a lot more and you suck at it then you're probably doomed to be unhappy because the fact is that you should be finding the place where you can do something you like something that you're good at and something you feel makes the difference if you can find the sweet spot that has all three of those characteristics then you're likely to have a happier life do you find that you do you think that you have a job that has all three of those characters well yeah I mean I I love what I do and I'm pretty good at talking it turns out and I'm a pretty good writer I love the inflection when you talked about I love what I do I'm so tired right now Alicia
