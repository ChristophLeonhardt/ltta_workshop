<font color="#CCCCCC">millay in my pants which I was actually</font>

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to buy our so close buying it and</font>

20

21
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,750
shouldn't buy this so I went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,489
up and luckily in my library have like

23
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:48,780
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> online service which means that you</font>

24
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,870
can get books out from any library in

25
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">the London borough I've been enjoying</font>

26
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,020
that and they're already<font color="#E5E5E5"> lovely editions</font>

27
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,020
and it's it's a beautiful book smells

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,609
good as well but couldnt what I lost

29
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,649
girls in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their married bliss in my pants</font>

30
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,149
the only reason that I picked this up is

31
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,589
because it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little quotation from</font>

32
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,510
Philip Roth<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front who says that Edna</font>

33
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,729
O'Brien who wrote this is the most

34
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,439
gifted women now writing fiction in

35
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,619
English I I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty good</font>

36
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,549
endorsement and it's it's not huge and

37
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:19,439
it looks quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> good so that's gonna be</font>

38
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the read this one set in Mexico</font>

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,799
and it looks slightly spooky it's called

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,479
a zigzag way in my pants but I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

41
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,880
decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't really know much</font>

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,409

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,020
got more poetry 73 poems in my pants by

48
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,180
e cummings partly after the insistence

49
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,270
of Alan but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he Cummings is a fabulous</font>

50
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">poet nothing and also after hearing a</font>

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,200
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> and John's ba</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TVs and so on and</font>

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,680
looking up someone internet that I have

53
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,850
made me think who I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't read any and</font>

54
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,009
arrived and I reserved it and is a nice

55
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,240
surprise because when you go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say oh</font>

56
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,770
I wanted to collect my<font color="#E5E5E5"> collected poems</font>

57
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,750
very simple it's in Malay and he's like

58
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,399
all you have another book and actually

59
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,320
had two other books but I couldn't get

60
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,788
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> third one because i already had ten</font>

61
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:10,919
books out this one's completely random

62
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">American Gothic in my parents it's all</font>

63
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,260
about this painting and it's nonfiction

64
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,099
and it's just I don't know really

65
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:19,840
interested me a kind of study<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what it</font>

66
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">means in different interpretations of it</font>

67
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:22,750
and things like that I've just<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

68
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">intrigued by it but it's just one of</font>

69
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,299
those completely random books that a pic

70
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:26,709
because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it on display in the</font>

71
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:27,940
library they're really effective like

72
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,590
that there's a book that they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

73
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,420
selling my book shop for a while unwind

74
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,310
in my pants it seems kind of futuristic

75
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,519
and gory and it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing that</font>

76
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:38,769
I would enjoy recommending this isn't

77
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:40,780
fiction this is questions from the

78
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,190
frontiers of cosmology it's all about

79
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,170
the universe and I'm probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

80
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,730
understand a word of it but I'm excited

81
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be about to read the infinite cosmos</font>

82
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,950
in my pants that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be quite big</font>

83
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,319
there it's all about like the structure

84
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,940
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the universe and dark matter and</font>

85
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,200
everything and I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited to</font>

86
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,450
read it but it's not too big<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

87
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,150
writing well it's tiny but it could be

88
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,879
smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I'm finally getting around</font>

89
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,700
to reading this I read quite a bit of it

90
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,410
at one point<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then never picked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it up</font>

91
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,870
again I don't like film covers but it's

92
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay brideshead revisited in my pants</font>

93
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,670

94
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,049
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think is gonna make them worn</font>

95
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:19,030
oxford this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just something completely</font>

96
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,590
rounded the infinite wisdom of Herot

97
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,329
rose in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> pants which i think is were</font>

98
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,250
about someone who's softcore writings

99
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,959
get published by her parents I didn't

100
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:27,459
I'd know nothing about it looks quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

101
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:29,349
hairy fairy and I just would really like

102
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:31,000

and it only came out of the UK last year

109
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,889
I know it's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> out in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

112
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,620
of books barely standing up next to the

116
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,650

118
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:03,639
