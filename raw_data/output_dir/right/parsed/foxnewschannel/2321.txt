ELIZABETH: THAT'S RIGHT, OF
COURSE.
THANK YOU, APPRECIATE IT.
HERE TO WEIGH IN, FOX NEWS
NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN
POLICY ANALYST WALID PHARES.
YOU'VE HEARD GREG PALKOT SAY
THAT THIS HAS GONE WRONG IN THE
PAST.
MY FIRST QUESTION, WHAT EXACTLY
DOES HE WANT, AND I'M SPEAKING
OF KIM JONG-UN AND ALSO, AS
THESE CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE, IF
THEY CONTINUE, HOW CAN WE SORT
OF DECIPHER PROGRESS?
>> THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.
THAT'S THE QUESTION OF THE DAY.
THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER, OR
DICTATOR, WANTS BASICALLY TO
PROTECT HIS REGIME, AND HE'S
MEASURING HOW MUCH HE'S GOING TO
BE PAYING FOR THIS.
STOPPING THE MISSILE TEST, HE
COULD DO THAT.
MAYBE START TO REDIRECT THE
PROGRAM, HE COULD DO THAT.
THE THING, HIS RED LINE, WOULD
BE DO NOT TOUCH MY REGIME, IT'S
A ONE-PARTY REGIME AND THAT'S
THE CHALLENGE, THERE COULD BE
CHANGES ON THE GROUND.
NORTH KOREANS COULD BE GIVEN
POSSIBILITIES AND THAT COULD BE
A RISK FOR HIM.
ELIZABETH: THERE WAS ONE
STATEMENT PUT OUT THIS MORNING,
NUCLEAR-FREE ZONE, PENINSULA, IF
YOU WILL.
MY QUESTION TO YOU WOULD MEAN
THAT WOULD PROBABLY INCLUDE
PROBABLY THE 28,000 TROOPS IN
SOUTH KOREA TO LEAVE AND THAT'S
PROBABLY NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN?
>> IT COULD, BUT, YES, AT THIS
POINT IN TIME THE 20,000 TROOPS
ARE BASICALLY FACING THE
MILITARY TROOPS TO THE NORTH.
SO, IT'S REALLY THE TASK FORCES
THAT WE HAVE IN THE OCEAN,
VERSUS THE MISSILES.
SO IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM A
BALANCE OF POWER, IF HE DISARMS
HIS MISSILES THEN WE COULD
REDEPLOY:
IF HE WOULD LISTEN HIS MILITARY
IN THE NORTH, WE COULD REDEPLOY.
THE MAJOR QUESTION THAT I HAVE
HERE, HOW DO WE MEASURE THAT
HE'S GOING TO THAT DIRECTION.
WE HAVE THE MILITARY MONITORING,
OF COURSE, AND SURVEILLANCE,
VERY STRICT, BUT ALSO THE MOST
IMPORTANT FACTOR, WILL HE ALLOW
HIS CITIZENS TO VISIT THE SOUTH?
THAT WILL BE A MAINLY GAME
CHANGER.
ELIZABETH: I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
THAT.
I'M SORT OF CURIOUS ON WHO HAS
THE UPPER HAND GOING INTO THE
MEETINGS AND AS WE GO INTO THE
MEETINGS, WOULD HE SORT OF TREAD
LIGHTLY AND MAYBE NOT ASK FOR
SANCTIONS TO BE RELEASED
IMMEDIATELY?
WOULD HE START SORT OF LOWERING
THE BAR, IF YOU WILL?
>> NORMALLY HE WILL ASK FOR
EVERYTHING HE WANTS TO ASK FOR
AND THEN, OF COURSE--
>> HE READ ART OF THE DEAL,
MAYBE.
>> YES, MAYBE TRANSLATED TO HIM,
BUT REMEMBER, THERE'S ALSO CHINA
BEHIND HIM.
HE HAS BEEN PREPPED BY THE CHINA
DURING HIS VISITS SO THEY WILL
BE BASICALLY DOING THE LARGER
NEGOTIATION WITH US, WITH THE
UNITED STATES, AND HE WILL BE
PART OF THAT NEGOTIATION,
BASICALLY.
>> BEFORE YOU GO, I DO WANT TO
SHIFT TO SORT OF A LARGER
FOREIGN POLICY OUTLOOK.
OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS A BIG WEEK
WITH THE WHITE HOUSE, WE SAW THE
FRENCH PRESIDENT, SAW THE GERMAN
CHANCELLOR.
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE AWAY THIS WEEK
ON WHERE WE STAND IN THE WORLD?
>> WELL, BASICALLY THE TWO
EUROPEAN LEADERS WERE HERE FOR
ONE SPECIFIC ISSUE, THE IRAN
DEAL.
THEY FEEL THAT THE PRESIDENT AND
HIS ADMINISTRATION ARE HEADING
TOWARDS WITHDRAWING FROM THE
DEAL.
THEY FEEL THERE'S A MAJORITY IN
CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC
WHO DO NOT TRUST THE DEAL.
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO,
CONVINCE THE PRESIDENT, LOOK, WE
HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE FOR YOU, WE
HAVE ANOTHER DEAL, BUT DO NOT
LET GO OF THE DEAL BEFORE HAVING
THE ALTERNATIVE.
AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S
POSITION IS, FIRST I'LL WITHDRAW
FROM THE DEAL, BUT I'M READY TO
RENEGOTIATE SO IT PUTS PRESSURE
ON HIM AT THIS POINT IN TIME.
ELIZABETH: HE'S MAKING THAT
DECISION ON MAY 12TH.
>> HE'S MAKING THE DECISION ON
