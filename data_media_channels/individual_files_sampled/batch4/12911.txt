if you were watching the show yesterday you know that I I started the show by kind of bragging a little bit about my globe here would end for good reason because a globe when you add a globe into the situation it immediately makes everything classier and more professional and more intelligent so even though I don't have a real studio or a real set I do have the globe and the point that I made was well yeah the other guys at the Daily wire they've got a studio they've got a set they don't have a globe though do they so who really has the most professional show with the daily wire that that was that was my argument anyway but after the show a lot of people informed me that actually Clavin does have a globe on his set I never noticed it before but I went back and I and I watched and yeah there is kind of off in the corner it's not displayed prominently like my globe but he does have a globe so this is what I'm gonna do I didn't want to have to do this but I'm going to add a second globe and so now I have the most Globes both in terms of globe quantity and also total globe it's all you and if it's really necessary for me to pull out the big guns and I and I'm kind of hesitant here because I well I don't mean the show-off but if I really need to also have this and I could do the entire show with this globe as well and what would look more professional or more intelligent than that okay but I won't I won't yet unless it's really necessary now these globes are kind of relevant to what I want to talk about and before I get into the real subject in all seriousness I should add a little bit of a parental disclaimer parental advisory if you're watching this or listening to this and you have little kids around you may want to pause it and come back to it because we're gonna talk about some things that are a bit graphic and upsetting but also necessary in order for me to make the point that I want to make so ben shapiro wrote a piece yesterday for the daily wire taking note of a report which was published in science magazine and the report yet again reveals the the unbelievable scale of human sacrifice and barbarity among the ancient Aztecs and Shapiro is using this to make the point that we tend to romanticize foreign cultures especially Native American cultures and in the process when we romanticizing them we kind of tend to ignore just the sheer savagery that was and in some cases still is so common in certain cultures what Shapiro is really the point he was really making is that this kind of cultural equivalency that we do where we say ah all cultures are equal you can't judge any cultures no culture is better than any other culture that is clearly not the case as evidenced by the human sacrifices among lastic the Spanish culture the Spanish who conquered the Aztecs their culture in their civilization was clearly better than the Aztec culture and this is me talking now not been the Spanish culture was superior in every way now when I say superior that is not a racial designation it's not it's got nothing to do with race its superior because it was superior in terms of its scientific achievements its artistic achievements its even its philosophical and political achievements yeah the Aztecs had big big cities and they had they had a big temples that they built they even had some artwork although their art was largely hideous and grotesque and terrifying but they had all that stuff but they had not advanced anywhere near as far as the European said but when I say that the Spanish civilization was a superior civilization I mean primarily morally it was a morally superior civilization the Spanish weren't perfect by any means and they did practice some they practice slavery but then again every single civilization in the world in 16th century practiced slavery so that's not much of a surprise none of that compares to the Aztecs though the Aztecs would build these great temples where ritual and sacrifices would occur with the brutality and in a volume that is just incomprehensible some historians estimate that the Aztecs sacrificed up to 50,000 human beings a year keep in mind there were only about 4 or 5 million people living in Aztec territory so that means that they would have sacrificed about 1 percent of their total population on an annual basis that is an astronomical figure and when I say sacrifice we should understand what that means what it means is that they would they would they would take the offering up to the top of the pyramid they would put him down on a slab they would plunge and a priest would plunge a knife into the chest of the person and cut a big hole reach his hand then and while the person is still alive rip out his beating heart and then they would cut off his head and his limbs his torso would be rolled down the steps and then his limbs would often time be ritualistically consumed by the other Aztec priests there was a period of about four days when the Aztecs were coordinating a new temple that they had just built where they carried out this process with 80,000 people in four days they sacrificed 80,000 people in four days and they would furnish themselves with sacrifices mainly by conquering and subjugating neighboring tribes so when you hear about how the Europeans showed up and they stole land and they did all that well the Aztecs like many other Indian civilizations the land that they possess they had themselves stolen it and when the Aztecs stole your land they didn't just feel your land they would then start taking your people and bringing them to the top of a temple and ripping out their hearts that's what the Aztecs would do if you in fact if you're curious curious about how the and that's how Aztecs treated their own people and other Indians if you're curious about how the Aztecs treated the Spanish here is a I just briefly read a passage is a book called Cortez about the clash of civilizations between the Spanish and the Aztecs by Richard Lee Marx is a great book I recommend reading it it's it's it's non biased very objective book but here's just a quick passage so this is later on in the book after this after the fighting had begun between the Spanish and the Aztecs up until this point the Spanish had been relatively merciful toward the Aztecs but then some Spanish were caught by the Aztecs they were prisoners of war and while the other Spanish soldiers stood off at a far distance a few miles away watching this this this is what happened to the to these Spanish prisoners they were all taken they were stripped naked they were brought to the pyramid to the to the temple they were brought up the steps they were forced to dance naked in front of the in front of the demonic idols of the Aztecs and then here's what happened after an hour this is an hour of dancing of these of these prisoners dancing naked after an hour a high priest signaled and the dancing was terminated though the beating of the drum and the jangling of the bells and tambourines continued as tech priests rushed forward and took back from the dancers their headdresses and plumes then the first victim was pulled to the sacrifice stone thrown down on his back and held spread-eagle the high priest came forward held above his head the Flint knife and drove it into the victims chest he then cut across the ribs and plunging his hand into the chest cavity tore loose the beating heart the priest held aloft the Spaniards heart with which with its few final spasms gush blood that fell on the priests face while a din of shrieking rose from the other people but the other Indians were watching this the other priests took the heart into the temple placed it before the idols while others systematically cut off the victim's head arms and legs and disdainfully rolled the split open torso to the top of the steps with a few kicks sent it downward and this was repeated for all the victims now as I said up to that point they asked the Spanish had been relatively merciful towards the Aztecs but now they're watching this take place and this again this is just barbarity and savagery that the Europeans had never encountered before they couldn't even conceive of it and they're watching this happening and now their policy of being relatively merciful well that was out the window and I think understandably so they realized that okay if we're gonna beat these people we're gonna have to be pretty brutal about it now the significance of this report in science magazine which which cites new archaeological evidence is that it corroborates the testimony from the Spanish themselves the Spanish told stories of finding these temples stacked with human skulls like thousands of human skulls that have been stacked and were being displayed like trophies and nobody no one's ever doubted that these sacrifices took place that's a matter of historical record but some for a long time have tried to argue that the Spanish exaggerated the scale of it well we now have the remains of these giant skull racks and so it's pretty clear that that the Spanish did not exaggerate I think we can glean two important things from all this number one it's you know what been argued is correct that not all cultures are equal the Aztecs were clearly a more brutal more savage more frankly evil culture and if it was a white civilization doing this if it was if it was a white civilization enslaving thousands of people and ripping their hearts out and eating them everybody would agree that that that that that's a country needs to that needs to be invaded and the ruling forces need to be toppled aggressively but in this case we kind of see it as some kind of travesty that this brutal regime was toppled just because of the racial dynamics at play and by the way when Cortes launched his final siege of the capital city where what is now Mexico City it's true that ultimately the entire city was destroyed and almost every inhabitant was slaughtered but most of the wholesale slaughter did not happen on the part of the Spanish it was on the part of the Indian allies of the Spanish who had been oppressed for years by the Aztecs and so they were they wanted vengeance and so the other Indians went into the you know they they they went in with the Spanish and they started pulling men women and children out of their homes and just slaughtering them in the streets but here's the second thing that we can glean from all this it's okay for us in the West to admire and honor the great men who built our civilization men like Cortez for instance they were flawed you know they certainly were flawed and Europeans were guilty of atrocities of their own but nobody tells Native Americans that they can't be proud of their heritage nobody tells them that even though in the case of the Aztecs and many other Indian civilizations they they were guilty of just barbaric atrocities but no one tells Native Americans you can't be you can't be proud of your past and you can't have your own heroes that you looked by the way the Mayans also practiced human sacrifice in fact archaeologists recently uncovered in Mayan territory a mass grave of toddlers who had been sacrificed the Incas down in South America around the same time they were also avid human sacrifices that they were that they would take children fatten them up lead them to the top of a mountain and then strangle them to death or leave them there to die of exposure in the cult and the Mayans Incas Aztecs these were the three major Indian civilizations throughout Central and South America all of them were unspeakably brutal yet we don't indict them for it and we don't say that those who have that heritage shouldn't be proud of it but this is how it goes every non Western non-white country is allowed to celebrate its history allowed to celebrate its heritage they're allowed to celebrate the great men and women who helped build their civilizations even if those men and women are guilty of terrible things and even if they they also stole land and enslaved and did all those things I mean you could go to Mongolia and find Staten monuments to Genghis Khan Genghis Khan raped half the women women in Asia I mean Genghis Khan just went throughout Asia enslaving conquering and raping that was his entire career yet they build monuments to him and nobody would ever even dream of telling a Mongolian that you shouldn't look up the Genghis Khan even though Genghis Khan was a was a horrible person yet in the West we're supposed to hold our heroes and our pioneers to this impossibly high standard and if they committed any crime if they were guilty of any sin even if it was a sin utterly common to their time and shared by almost everyone of all races like slavery well in that case we're supposed to tear down their monuments and spit on their graves that's only in the West we don't expect anyone else to do that it's only in our civilization in our culture that we're required to do that take Columbus as another example Columbus you know our treatment of Columbus in modern times is just disgraceful and utterly stupid Columbus was a great man a great great man who achieves something spectacular achieve something earth-shattering world-changing he achieved something far more significant than anything you will ever in your life achieve or me will never even come close to doing what Columbus did and yet now we treat him with with like contempt and we focus on how this is the bad thing that he did look at these bad things at dumbest of all people will go you know that this is this this is the stupidest thing when people say say well what Columbus didn't even mean to discover America and he never set foot on North America and the Vikings got there first haha what an idiot Columbus was he didn't even mean to yeah those are nice little tidbits of information that you acquired from Facebook memes but they're not relevant to anything of course Columbus didn't mean to discover America nobody knew that America existed how could they no one knew it was there no one had seen it and if that's if the Vikings did stumble upon Newfoundland at some point centuries prior they didn't establish a lasting colony they didn't continue their exploration they didn't understand the significance of their discovery or leave clear records of it so as far as Europe knew in 1492 the world consisted of one giant landmass and a huge ocean in but you know separating one side from the other that's as far as anyone knew how could anyone know differently somebody had to get in a ship and sail across this unknown body of water to find out what was on the other side because you know it's not like anybody out west what's going to get in a ship and go that way the Aztecs and the Mayans and the Incas they weren't getting in ships and exploring anything so Columbus had to be the guy he didn't have satellites okay Columbus navigated mostly with dead reckoning through completely uncharted waters he covered like 5,000 miles of Uncharted ocean with nothing but dead right you know dead reckoning is that's like you you you figure out your last fixed point so the last port where you were at and and you you you figure out based on mathematical calculations and you come up with kind of an estimate of where you're headed but part of that calculation you know what you need for that calculation you need to know how fast you're going well in 1492 how do you figure out how fast your ship is going again you don't have GPS so you know what they had to do they called it heaving the log okay this is how they would for us we just check in a you know the the speedometer but for them it was heaving the log and so that literally meant that they would take a piece of wood and they would throw it into the water and then just judge based on how long it you know how long it takes for the wood to drift away from them they would from there that extrapolate their speed and then they would factor that in with the last fixed point and the other calculations and then they would figure out where they were going so using that method across unknown waters Columbus managed to make it to the Caribbean and then make it back there three more times you want to try that okay start in Spain with nothing but a compass and a piece of wood get into a ship and make your way to Cuba you think you can do it alive I think that's quite an achievement you know and you'd think that that a bunch of people in modern society who can't even locate their local supermarket two-and-a-half miles away without GPS you think we'd be pretty impressed with Columbus like in order for you if you wanted to to go ten miles down the road on a highway you're going to be using your GPS which is connected to a network of satellites in space I mean you need a network of satellites in space communicating with your phone at the speed of light just to make it you know fifty block down the street so yeah I think we should be pretty impressed with Columbus on the other explorers and what about the Indians that at that Columbus encountered yeah some of them were peaceful but we've taken this image of the peaceful Indians to ridiculous lengths I mean bear in mind there was a tribe called the carrots and they rained terror on the region where Columbus landed knees were brutal and violent people who regularly feasted on human beings this again is a concept utterly foreign to European the idea of eating other people and this was not uncommon among Indian tribes now on his first voyage Columbus never encountered any Caribes but he heard about them and then he encountered them on his second voyage here's something they don't they don't teach you in school Columbus actually tried to free actually did free a number of Indian captives that the Caribes were preparing to eat so in one village on an island where Columbus had stopped the Spaniards they found a young boy tied up in a cage and he was being fattened for consumption and so when Columbus encountered stuff like that he would oftentimes free the people so you know Columbus he never governed with the the savagery of of an Aztec king or or even a Carib chieftain but he was a pretty bad governor in his own right and he did took take slaves he was a man of his time in that way and he was a pretty incompetent governor but we have to keep in mind back in those days if you were an explorer and a sea captain you were expected to be I mean you had to be a navigator captain an astronomer a mathematician and when you made it to your destination you also had to be a politician and a governor and a king I mean you had to be all of those things and very few of those men could do all of those things perfectly I don't think any man in the world could so I think all in all it should be said that Columbus was brilliant on the sea not so brilliant on land this kind of a common dynamic Cortez was a great warrior when he conquered the Aztecs he wasn't a very good governor afterwards Magellan was an incredible navigator who sailed the circumference of the globe almost but he got himself killed in an unnecessary battle with a tribe in the Philippines so you know he also had his flaws and a Magellan you know Magellan is another guy that we now look to and we judge for his his ruthlessness but you think about what he was up against he was looking for a passage so that he could sail all the way around the globe in the 1500s again without GPS without anything and along the way he had to deal with you know with hostile tribes that he encountered he had to deal with starvation you had to deal with disease he had to deal with mutinies and so yeah he was a little bit brutal in fact when he made it to South America and they they decided to to kind of camp out in a harbor over for winter there was a mutiny took place and now I mean just think about Magellan he's got his he's got his ships he's on the other side of the world he's in this unknown wilderness he's thousands of miles away from any kind of authority and now he's got a mutiny on his hands so what does he do he he brutally squashes the mutiny and he takes one of the mutineers as an example he hasn't executed and he it quarters him which means he cuts off his limbs and he puts his limbs on different parts of the ship as a warning to the others not to not to try that again now we can look at that and we could say oh that's just that's just very bad that's so you see this is not a man that we can look up to or admire well again let me ask you how do you handle that you're a thousand you're thousands of miles away from any kind of help you're on this expedition now you've got a mutiny on your hands and all your men are ganging up to take over the the ship and kill you I mean what do you do how do you handle that so I think ultimately what we're left with with you know a lot of our cultural heroes were left with this legacy of flawed men who are also responsible for some of the greatest achievements in the history of mankind and maybe you can look at them and say well I could have done that better I guarantee that you couldn't but you could say that I know that I couldn't done it any better but the real fact of the matter is you wouldn't have even tried you would not have gotten into a ship and said all right I'm gonna sail that way across this body of water and I have no idea what's on the other side of it or if there even is anything on the other side you wouldn't even done that that takes courage I mean that takes boldness that requires a visionary that requires a truly great man to do something like that and the only reason why we exist today the only reason why our civilization exists is that great men took great risks and did great things and yeah I think we ought to look up to them and admire them and build statues to them and tell our children about them and honor them and I think it's a it's a it's a huge mistake when we start apologizing for and erasing our own history and it's also just a disgraceful way to treat these men who gave you everything I mean the people that complain about Columbus you aren't you're just sitting back on your butt on on the sofa you know eating a snack watching TV living off the fat of the land living off of this civilization that wouldn't have existed without men like Columbus oh you're just sitting there yeah but you know what he did this and that wrong so yeah you know what I don't need that guy there's a very good chance you know that if the Europeans had never come to the new world they would still be ripping you'd still have the Aztecs ripping out hearts and you'd still have the Incas killing children as sacrifices to their gods I mean there's a very good chance that would still be happening if the Europeans hadn't shown up all right just going to move my globe there as you can see both of them thank buddy thanks for listening Godspeed you
