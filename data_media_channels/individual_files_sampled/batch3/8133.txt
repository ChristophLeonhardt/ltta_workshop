ASSETS BEFORE. HOW WAS LAST NIGHT'S STRIKE DIFFERENT. DAVID LEE? YOU MAKE A VERY GOOD POINT. THIS WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST STRIKES IN YEARS. HOW MUCH SO? THIS WAS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF MILITARY ISRAELI ACTION WE'VE SEEN IN SYRIA SINCE THE END OF THE YOM KIPPUR WAR IN 1973. ISRAEL RARELY ACKNOWLEDGES ANY TYPE OF MILITARY ACTION BUT NOW WE ARE SEEING ISRAELI MILITARY MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR EVENTS OVER THE LAST 12 HOURS. ISRAEL IS SAYING ITS FIGHTER JETS DESTROYED THE IRANIAN ROCKET LAUNCHER THAT IRAN'S ELITE AL QUD FORCE USED HOURS EARLIER AND CAUSED SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE IRANIAN MILITARY INFRASTRUCTURE IN SYRIA, SPECIFICALLY HITTING A LOGISTICS HEADQUARTERS, WAREHOUSE AND A WAR MONITORING GROUP IS SAYING THAT THERE ARE 23 DEAD, 18 OF WHOM ARE FOREIGNERS, THAT IS NON-SYRIANS. AS FOR IRAN, THEY ARE NOT COMMENTING ON THE ISRAELI ATTACK. SYRIA, THOUGH, SAYING ONE OF ITS OWN RADAR BASES WAS HIT ALONG WITH A WEAPONS DEPOT AND ITS AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM. AT THIS HOUR, BILL, HERE ON THE GOLAN HEIGHTS, THINGS ARE QUIET BUT VERY, VERY TENSE. PEOPLE HERE KNOW THE SITUATION CAN CHANGE LITERALLY ANY MINUTE. Bill: WHAT IS SYRIA'S ROLE IN IRAN'S ATTACK AGAINST ISRAEL? WELL, WHAT'S NOTEWORTHY HERE IS THE ISRAELIS SAY IT WAS THE IRANIANS THAT LAUNCHED THIS ATTACK BUT DID SO FROM SYRIAN TERRITORY. PRELIMINARY REPORTS NOW SUGGEST THAT THE REGIME OF ASSAD IS TRYING TO DISTANCE ITSELF FROM THE LATEST IRANIAN MILITARY AGGRESSION. FOX NEWS LEARNED THAT EUROPEAN SOURCES HAVE BEEN TOLD ASSAD AND SENIOR SYRIAN LEADERS HAD NO KNOWLEDGE AND DID NOT CONSENT TO THE ATTACK LED BY THE IRANIAN AL QUD FORCE AND ITS GENERAL. SOURCES SAY THAT THEIR COMMANDER USED FURY AND MILITARY RESOURCES IN THE LATEST ATTACK AGAINST ISRAEL WITHOUT DAMASCUS. HE COMES AS A FREE AGENT. THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY WHATSOEVER TO DAMASCUS. SO THIS SEEMS TO UNDERSCORE THAT THERE IS A LACK OF AWARENESS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSAD LEADERSHIP ABOUT WHAT THE IRANIANS MAY BE DOING ON THE GROUND IN THEIR VERY OWN COUNTRY. LASTLY, BILL, IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN ISRAEL HAS SAID IT WILL NOT TOLERATE ANY IRANIAN MILITARY PRESENCE
