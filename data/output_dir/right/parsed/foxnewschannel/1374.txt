GOODED TO SEE YOU.
DR. MARC SIEGEL.
>> Arthel: THANK YOU.
ON THIS MEMORIAL DAY, WE WANT
TO TELL YOU ABOUT OUR SERVICE
MEMBERS WHO RUMBLE AROUND THE
BATTLEFIELD IN HEAVILY ARMORED
VEHICLES WHILE THE TRANSPORTS
MAY SAVE THEM FROM AN I.E.D.
DETONATION, GETTING OUT OF THE
MANGLED VEHICLE SAFELY IS A
DIFFERENT CHALLENGE.
WE LOOK AT HOW THEY PREPARE.
>> TRYING TO SIMULATE A
TRAINING SCENARIO IN CASE YOUR
VEHICLE ROLLS, HIT AN I.E.D.,
OR SOME DAMAGE OF THAT SORT.
>> IF YOU WERE TO ROLL INTO A
CANAL, GIVE ME REAL WORLD
STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR
GUYS THERE AND HOW IT HELPS
THERE.
>> REAL WORLD, A VEHICLE ROLLS
ON A SERPENTINE AND IT GOES
DOWN, ARMOR ON IT WITH WEIGHT
THROWN AROUND.
LANDING ON A WEIRD ANGLE.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT DOORS ARE
CRUSHED OR OPEN.
THE MARINES ARE DISORIENTED.
THEY HAVE TO GET OUT OF THERE
QUICKLY, ESPECIALLY TALKING
ABOUT A BODY OF WATER.
WE DEVELOP THIS SYSTEM TO
TRAIN TO ALLOW US TO ROLL OVER
A VARIETY OF ANGLES.
THE OPERATOR OUTSIDE WILL
UNLOCK A DOOR.
YOU HAVE TO FIND A DOOR TO GET
OUT.
IT WILL INCREASE YOUR COMFORT
AND THE FAMILIARITY GETTING
OUT OF A VEHICLE, ESPECIALLY
IF YOU'RE DISORIENTED IN THE
ROLLOVER SITUATION.
>> THERE IS A BALANCE HERE.
THROUGHOUT THE WARS IN IRAQ
AND AFGHANISTAN, YOU LEARNED
THAT HUMVEES WERE MORE
VULNERABLE TO I.E.D. AND
AMBUSHES.
YOU ADD ARMOR AND YOU HAVE A
RISK OF THE ROLLOVERS THAT GO
UP.
>> YOU CAN'T NEGATE CASUALTIES
OR INCIDENT.
YOU HAVE TO MITIGATE.
I'D RATHER HAVE A ROLLOVER
VEHICLE WITH LOWER RISK OF
INJURY AND PERSONNEL WHERE
THEY ARE STILL ALIVE IN
ARMORED SITUATION THAN LIGHTLY
OR UNARMORRED VEHICLE WHERE I
DON'T KNOW IF MY PEOPLE ARE
WALKING OUT OF IT.
>> HOW DOES IT APPLY TO A MORE
CONVENTIONAL WAR?
>> THE BIG THING IS HYBRID
WARFARE.
IT USES CROSS OF THE
CONVENTIONAL TACTICS TAN
UNCONVENTIONAL TACTICS.
