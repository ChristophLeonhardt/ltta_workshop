00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so speaking today about</font>

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,270
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> self image videos that I and so</font>

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,890
many other youtubers made back at the

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">beginning of 2013 and I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,300
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> single video on</font>

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,550
your channel is a sort of self image

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,019
video I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I watch a few video</font>

8
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,250
brothers videos after that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

9
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,079
framing them as what if the title<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

10
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,910
this had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> self image 2013 or</font>

11
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,830
whatever I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found it really revealing and</font>

12
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,390
I just kind of suggests that as a

13
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,920
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you think that if I were</font>

14
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,390
to make a specifically self image video

15
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,519
now halfway through 2013 my outlook

16
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,900
would be quite different my job has

17
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,119
changed and then also it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

18
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,040
time of<font color="#E5E5E5"> year and very seasonal I</font>

19
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely hate winter I can't stand it</font>

20
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,780
makes me so so miserable it's so dark

21
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,420
and it's horrible but June which like

22
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,559
even though it hasn't been that amis

23
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,149
been warm today even though it hasn't

24
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:43,950
been that warm the days are longer and

25
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,140
it just makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me so much happier I'm</font>

26
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like completely yeah a completely</font>

27
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,340
different person really one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I have</font>

28
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,110
been thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot though is the</font>

29
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,379
sort of brand idea of the channel I'm

30
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting so many like business proposals</font>

31
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,309
and that sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff through my</font>

32
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,440
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> and email and like a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,760
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't even really look at</font>

34
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,040
I'm obviously made me correspond with

35
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">publishers when they tell me about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

36
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,920
these new exciting books that they're

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,840
releasing that's been really cool game

38
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,479
to read more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of them just</font>

39
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,340
before they're out so get let's get you

40
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,990
on it and get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of know my stuff</font>

41
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,520
just as I used to but other than that I

42
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,830
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to be kind of brand focus less</font>

43
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,560
about brand in terms of what I want to

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,270
sell the money I want to make less the

45
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,119
commercial side of a brand but more what

46
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,220
I want my videos to stand forward and

47
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,869
you know I guess the value aspect of the

48
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:35,970
brat what we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is extremely</font>

49
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,920
valuable<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that isn't something you</font>

50
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,479
can really put a price on and the

51
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,860
conversations we do have here of

52
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,540
extremely valuable and then I think the

53
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,159
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge to me at least is having</font>

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,409
decided what I value<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of being</font>

55
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,600
as consistent as possible with it

56
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,340
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's obviously I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think always</font>

57
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,570
going to be points where you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

58
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,729
different for you don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> live up</font>

59
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,340
to what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to live up to as long</font>

60
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,869
as you're being at least fairly

61
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,600
consistent and in trying to get there um

62
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,420
I think that's a big thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

63
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,219
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big plus it's hard because I</font>

64
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,360
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about this but I don't want</font>

65
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to name any specific companies or</font>

66
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,940
specific projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would like</font>

67
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,770
identify anyone there have been things

68
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,330
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

69
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,000
been offered just like yeah I could do

70
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,700
it and then I can get money but<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if</font>

71
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,380
you guys didn't news or respect for me

72
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,090
which if I reviewer I would lose all

73
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,890
respect for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be what the</font>

74
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,930
channel is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Forrest channel has never</font>

75
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,110
been a cash cow it's never been a way

76
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,090
for me to make money and those times

77
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,340
that I do kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of promote things like my</font>

78
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,350

00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,580
to do also something that I hope you

83
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,530
never feel is like an obligation like

84
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,690
you have to buy it to watch the channel

85
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,130
or anything like that because that's so

86
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,620
could not be farther from the truth it's
