51
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,140
he's kinda<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the stereotypical Nancy</font>

52
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,369
person you would normally cast as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nancy</font>

53
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:03,960
automatically but she's did really well

54
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,299
and then the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> two if I used to have</font>

55
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,520
a higher regard or just<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone down in my</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit envelopes yet I really like</font>

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">this I didn't want say too much because</font>

71
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,460
for fear of spoiling it it was brilliant

72
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,830
and I happen that I am slightly produce

73
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">case books where the cover has some wood</font>

74
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,730
the head calls because I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone reads trash and Easter which</font>

76
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,990
is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and website which post reviews</font>

77
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,300
about books generally aimed at the

<font color="#E5E5E5">female market and but all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reviews</font>

79
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">which owned by women I think in general</font>

80
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,320
and that's great great website don't put

81
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,360
a link somewhere over here or<font color="#CCCCCC"> over here</font>

82
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,410
and yes but in the UK a lot of books

83
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that their marketing is trashy have</font>

people's heads cut off<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's such a</font>

85
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,020
shame<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm really really really</font>

86
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,110
good books like this one we go unnoticed

87
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,900
and past cast aside is trashing because

88
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,880
they're on the same level as some really

89
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,860
really bad but which also have woman

90
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,660
with the head cough so I was slightly

91
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,850
prejudiced but it was great<font color="#E5E5E5"> and okay and</font>

92
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,320
doing a spoiler too much but I'm sure

93
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,790
you will know that at some point the

94
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,410
main<font color="#CCCCCC"> character goes to London it's</font>

95
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,450
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing to see it's like London</font>

96
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,590
as well from a different person

97
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,870
perspective but to still have it like an

98
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,940
accurate description because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will not</font>

99
