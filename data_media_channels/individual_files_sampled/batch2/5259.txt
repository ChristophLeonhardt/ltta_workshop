Governor John Kasich of Ohio joins us right now Governor Kasich of what do you make of the leadership coming from the White House on this issue of a lost US resident well Chris it I think it's just terrible look let's just say that the president's right we don't know okay because nobody really knows yet for sure even though the the the Germans the French the British have all called for an investigation the evidence has mounted in terms of US intelligence picking things up by what I've read a lot I've studied a lot of thought a lot about this but let's just give them the benefit of the doubt okay well then you don't go to a conference over there being so they can extend their economic power you don't talk about having arms sales you say we're gonna freeze the arms sales we're not gonna do that until we get to the bottom of this and Chris you know look I've heard people save heard the president's say this is about you know money the arms trade you know I had somebody say to me the other day America is an idea it is an idea the things that we believe in the things that we stand for that we believe in human rights and all these things that we have stood for for the last 70 years so money does not Trump it should never Trump our foreign policy actions and also Chris we gotta say that a lot of these CEOs who thought that they needed to be in Saudi Arabia from many many big companies in the United States stood up and said we're not going and they deserve credit for that they need to be they need to be held up and we need to be able to say to them that they've put some principle ahead of profit which is what is critical for the economic system of our country but Trump the president saying he's out there for Raytheon he's out there for Boeing he's out there for US producers he's acting like he's their you know commercial Trade Representative yeah well Chris that's not how you do foreign policy foreign policy is not just about gentlemen course we'd like to have jobs we want economic contacts it's why we you know we shouldn't be in all these trade wars we should try to get our to get our tariffs down so we can have more free trade we believe in free enterprise we believe in profit but we also believe there are principles that underlie Provident look'd is I know you're a guy that studies a lot of these philosophers Michael Novak the great Catholic theologians you know he said a a free enterprise system that is not under laid with a set of values as bankrupt we're not gonna go around and say okay we could sell more weapons to Saudi Arabia therefore we ought to look the other way I mean come listen Chris this is unanimous right this is this is a bipartisan outrage about this in at the meantime you don't go to the conference minuchin shouldn't go to the conference praise the CEOs that are not going to the conference and don't sell them any more weapons don't do that now till we get to the bottom of it and we will get to the bottom of it well governor this is the first time this isn't the first time the Trump has elevated the assurances of despotic leaders over his own intelligence community clinic oats look at this perhaps more than any president modern history Donald Trump is often willing and sometimes even eager to uncritically repeat the assertions of authoritarian leaders breaking with his own government experts let's take a look at some of those examples he said you know funny guy he's a very smart guy he's a great negotiator he loves his people not that I'm surprised by that but he loves his people I have great confidence in my intelligence people but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today a great honor and privilege because he's become a friend of mine to introduce President erawan of Turkey he's running a very very difficult part of the world he's involved very very strongly and frankly he's getting very high marks what do you make in that governor I mean this some on Chris look what is he do this good you remember that clarion moment when Reagan in the beginning said you know to dick out on the former national security adviser in regard to the Soviet Union we win and they lose he was standing up against repression now we look just not in the video an audio that you have just played but you think about the developments in Poland you think about the developments that are happening in Hungary right now a loss of the press the shutdown of the courts you know here's the thing Chris you can't look the other way when it comes to autocrats if you look the other way they're emboldened to do things that take away people's rights I was just with a European ambassador the other day that said when you start playing with fire with the extreme right any of these people who border on demagogues and that of course would occur to the stream extreme left as well you play with fire and you embolden people so this notion that somehow you know they're okay no they're terrible and we ought to point out where they're wrong that doesn't mean we have to go to war with them but we should be clear about the need for human rights freedom of the press freedom of religion freedom of speech these are essential elements for freedom in the Western world it's what our people went and fought and died for it when they landed on the beaches in World War two this is what we're about I know the other one I'm trying not to get emotional too much about this but that's what you should act rifice is for these things and we did you honor them you know with Jack Kennedy said along the lines you were just speaking there he said those who ride the tiger end up in its mouth thank you very much Governor John Kasich of Ohio a great honor and the passion
