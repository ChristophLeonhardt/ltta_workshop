1
00:00:01,294 --> 00:00:03,296
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

2
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:04,531
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?

3
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:07,534
>> WE KNEW THE PRESIDENT'S HANDS

4
00:00:07,534 --> 00:00:10,103
WERE TIED ONCE THE JUDICIARY

5
00:00:10,103 --> 00:00:10,870
COMMITTEE SHOULD THE REQUEST TO

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,838
THE WHITE HOUSE FOR THE

7
00:00:11,838 --> 00:00:15,809
PRESIDENT TO ASK THE FBI TO OPEN

8
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,611
UP A SUPPLEMENT INVESTIGATION

9
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:19,646
INTO JUDGE KAVANAUGH BACKGROUND.

10
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:20,947
THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T HAVE MUCH

11
00:00:20,947 --> 00:00:21,281
CHOICE.

12
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:24,618
WE GOT THE STATEMENT FROM THE

13
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:26,586
PRESS SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS

14
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:31,024
WHO SAID I ORDERED THE FBI TO

15
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:32,726
CONDUCT A SUPPLEMENT

16
00:00:32,726 --> 00:00:33,160
INVESTIGATION.

17
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,729
THIS MUST BE LIMITED IN SCOPE

18
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:43,537
AND COMPLETED IN LESS THAN ONE

19
00:00:43,537 --> 00:00:44,538
WEEK.

20
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:46,239
THAT WILL BE THE ARGUMENT.

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,943
WHAT IS THE SCOPE BE LIMITED?

22
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:50,310
.

23
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,647
THE REQUEST FROM THE JUDICIARY

24
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:57,050
SUBMIT WAS FOR ALL ALLEGATIONS

25
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,720
TO BE INVESTIGATED?

26
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:09,062
DOES THAT INCLUDE RAMIREZ AND

27
00:01:09,062 --> 00:01:13,533
THE AVANATI CLIENT?

28
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:14,568
THEY WOULD INTERVIEW PEOPLE WHO

29
00:01:14,568 --> 00:01:16,870
WERE SAID TO BE AT THE PARTY.

30
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,107
THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL

31
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:20,540
INVESTIGATION.

32
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,442
THIS IS MERELY COLLECTING

33
00:01:22,442 --> 00:01:23,643
BACKGROUND INFORMATION.

34
00:01:23,643 --> 00:01:28,315
IT DOES NOT COME TO ANY KIND OF

35
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:28,749
CONCLUSION.

36
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:30,283
ANY CONCLUSION WOULD HAVE TO BE

37
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:31,985
MADE BY THE WHITE HOUSE OR THE

38
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:32,619
SENATE IN THIS CASE.

39
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:33,887
IT'S GONE THROUGH THE JUDICIARY

40
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:34,621
COMMITTEE.

41
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:35,622
IT WILL BE THE FULL SENATE THAT

42
00:01:35,622 --> 00:01:38,425
HAS TO CONSIDER ALL OF THIS.

43
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:39,826
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH RELEASED A

44
00:01:39,826 --> 00:01:41,261
STATEMENT SAYING: THROUGHOUT

45
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:42,262
THIS PROCESS I HAVE BEEN

46
00:01:42,262 --> 00:01:45,833
INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI, I HAVE

47
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,101
DONE BACKGROUND CALLS DIRECTLY

48
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:51,538
WITH THE SENATE AND YESTERDAY I

49
00:01:51,538 --> 00:01:53,507
ANSWERED QUESTIONS UNDER OATH.

50
00:01:53,507 --> 00:01:56,510
I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY HAVE

51
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,079
REQUESTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO

52
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,480
COOPERATE."

53
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,882
GERALDO SAID THIS IS WAR AND HE

54
00:02:01,882 --> 00:02:03,050
IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

55
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,754
WHAT HAS GONE ON WITH THIS

56
00:02:06,754 --> 00:02:07,721
NOMINEE, IT'S ALL OUT WAR

57
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:08,989
BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND

58
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:09,723
DEMOCRATS.

59
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:11,291
I TALKED TO A REPUBLICAN

60
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,994
POLITICAL OPERATIVE WHO TOLD ME

61
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:15,696
WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT SEAT IN THE

62
00:02:15,696 --> 00:02:18,499
SUPREME COURT COMES UP.

63
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:20,100
MAYBE IT'S RUTH BADER GINSBURG.

64
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,937
RATHER THAN NOMINATING A MORE

65
00:02:22,937 --> 00:00:00,000
LIBERAL JUDGE THE PRESIDENT MAY
