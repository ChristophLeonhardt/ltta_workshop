Hi my name is Ivan Orkin and this is my shop.

2
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,639
We’re going to talk about the best ways
to eat a bowl of ramen.

3
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:19,500
The most important thing is to eat the ramen
while its hot.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,700
Any good ramen shop will serve you a bowl
of ramen that’s smoking hot and you need

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,619
to eat it right away because the noodles are
overcooking.

6
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:28,220
Its a lot like pizza.

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,930
If you’re a real New Yorker you know that
you don’t wait for the pizza to cool down,

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,500
you eat it while its hot and you risk burning
your mouth.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,560
Ramen is absolutely the same.

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,280
You need to slurp.

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,430
What it does is cool down the noodles.

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,500
Don’t fight the noodles.

13
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:50,860
Take a little less than you think you wanna
eat.

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,560
You want to pull them out from the pile cause
otherwise you’ll never be able to slurp.

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,540
easy on the toppings if you’re a first timer.

16
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,670
So when you order your first bowl of ramen
ever, just get it simple.

17
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,509
Taste it, see if you really like ramen.

18
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:10,220
And then you can start dumping on the toppings
and going for the shop’s special of the day.

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,420
Don’t forget to hydrate.

20
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,580
I’ve been to ramen shops in Tokyo where
afterwards my whole face is swollen with salt.

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,060
Its just the nature of the beast, so drink
up.

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,340
Ramen comes with a terrible spoon.

23
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,279
Its called a Renge, Chinese in origin.

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,569
Its a great way to be able to dip it into
the bowl.

25
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:34,780
But in Japan its totally cool to just pick
up the bowl and drink from it.

26
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,700
And remember, there are no real rules at the
end of the day.

27
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:41,679
You’re letting your hair down, you want
to have fun.

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:00:00,000
Get splashy, get noisy, get messy, but most
importantly enjoy yourself.
