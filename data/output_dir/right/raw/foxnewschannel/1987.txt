1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:01,412
YEARS JUST AS HE SUPPORTED

2
00:00:01,412 --> 00:00:02,980
BILL CLINTON AND TED KENNEDY AND

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:03,715
HARVEY WEINSTEIN.

4
00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:05,083
THEY'VE GOTTEN A PASS FOR ALL OF

5
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:05,383
THAT.

6
00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:06,884
THIS TIME IT'S WORTH GETTING TO

7
00:00:06,884 --> 00:00:07,919
THE BOTTOM OF THEIR COMPLICITY

8
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,520
IF ANY OF THIS.

9
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,122
TAMMY BRUCE IS A RADIO SHOW HOST

10
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:11,622
IN NEW YORK CITY.

11
00:00:11,622 --> 00:00:15,126
SHE JOINS US NOW.

12
00:00:15,126 --> 00:00:17,095
HOW LONG BEFORE ERIC

13
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:17,829
SCHNEIDERMAN'S ALLEGED ABUSES

14
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:20,098
BECOME THE ABUSE OF ALL MEN?

15
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:22,734
THIS IS REALLY A MACRO PROBLEM.

16
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:23,601
SHOULDN'T WE PAUSE BEFORE WE

17
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:26,371
SHIFT RESPONSIBILITY TO EVERYONE

18
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:28,573
AND ASKED WHO KNOW ABOUT THIS

19
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:29,307
SPECIFIC EYE?

20
00:00:29,307 --> 00:00:30,308
>> YES.

21
00:00:30,308 --> 00:00:32,176
I MEAN, LOOK, THIS IS STILL

22
00:00:32,176 --> 00:00:34,212
SINKING IN IT SO HORRIFIC.

23
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:35,146
IT'S ONE THING TO BE ARGUING

24
00:00:35,146 --> 00:00:36,481
ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN

25
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:37,115
TREATING WOMEN BADLY OR

26
00:00:37,115 --> 00:00:39,684
UNEQUALLY IN THE ONE PLACE, BAD

27
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:40,084
ENOUGH.

28
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:42,487
THESE ARE STORIES OF PHYSICAL

29
00:00:42,487 --> 00:00:43,321
VIOLENCE, OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE,

30
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:44,355
WHICH HAS NOT BEEN DEALT WITH A

31
00:00:44,355 --> 00:00:46,758
GREAT DEAL WHEN IT COMES TO THE

32
00:00:46,758 --> 00:00:49,193
#MeToo MOVEMENT AND A MAN WHO

33
00:00:49,193 --> 00:00:49,961
WAS LAW ENFORCEMENT.

34
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:52,330
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE

35
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,331
STATE AND IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY

36
00:00:53,331 --> 00:00:55,900
DYNAMIC AND WE KNOW THAT THESE

37
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,736
ISSUES TRANSCEND POLITICS AND

38
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,671
HERE IS THAT THESE ARE MEN,

39
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:01,606
WHETHER WITH HARVEY WEINSTEIN OR

40
00:01:01,606 --> 00:01:04,809
BILL CLINTON OR THE KENNEDYS ARE

41
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:05,443
NOW THIS MAN WHO WRAPPED

42
00:01:05,443 --> 00:01:08,679
THEMSELVES IN THE CLOAK OF THE

43
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:09,981
#MeToo MOVEMENT, OF FEMINISM

44
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:10,648
WHO SAID THAT THEY WERE THE

45
00:01:10,648 --> 00:01:14,085
CHAMPIONS FOR WOMEN AND ENDED UP

46
00:01:14,085 --> 00:01:14,952
BEING THE MAN THOUGHT THEY WERE

47
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:17,989
WARNING EVERYONE ABOUT AND THE

48
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:18,723
PROBLEM IS AS YOU MENTIONED IN

49
00:01:18,723 --> 00:01:21,292
THE RONAN STORY IS THAT FOR

50
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:24,095
WOMEN ON THE LEFT, LIBERAL WOMEN

51
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:26,130
HAVE BEEN TOLD AND EFFECTIVELY

52
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,365
CONDITIONED THAT YOU'VE GOT TO

53
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:29,667
EFFECTIVELY GIVE UP YOURSELF A

54
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:31,302
WAY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO HELP

55
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:34,939
THE MOVEMENT OR HELP THE LIBERAL

56
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:35,673
NARRATIVE THAT IRONICALLY THESE

57
00:01:35,673 --> 00:01:37,608
WOMEN WERE TOLD BY THEIR FRIENDS

58
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:39,977
OR EVEN DECIDED THEMSELVES IN

59
00:01:39,977 --> 00:01:40,945
ONE CASE THAT THEY WOULD PUT UP

60
00:01:40,945 --> 00:01:44,682
WITH THIS BECAUSE HE WAS TOO

61
00:01:44,682 --> 00:01:45,383
IMPORTANT, THAT THE ARGUMENT

62
00:01:45,383 --> 00:01:50,054
THAT WE WANT TO FIGHT TO PROTECT

63
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:50,755
WOMEN, THAT WE ARE GOING TO

64
00:01:50,755 --> 00:01:51,456
PROTECT A MAN WHO IS VIOLENT

65
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:52,323
TOWARDS THEM.

66
00:01:52,323 --> 00:01:53,925
THERE'S GOT TO BE -- THIS IS ONE

67
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:54,926
THING TO EXPOSE THEM, BUT

68
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:56,828
LIBERAL WOMEN HAVE TO ASK

69
00:01:56,828 --> 00:01:57,562
THEMSELVES WHAT OTHER LIES HAVE

70
00:01:57,562 --> 00:01:59,297
WE BEEN TOLD?

71
00:01:59,297 --> 00:02:01,265
WHAT OTHER THINGS HAVE WE BEEN

72
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:04,068
TOLD, HOW TO BEHAVE, OR WHAT WE

73
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:05,369
SHOULD SACRIFICE OURSELVES FOR

74
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,440
AND HERE'S THE OTHER REVELATION

75
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,608
HERE.

76
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:12,310
SCHNEIDERMAN EXPECTED IN SOME

77
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,312
WAYS, WE BELIEVE, TO BE PART OF

78
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:14,812
HILLARY CLINTON'S

79
00:02:14,812 --> 00:02:15,279
ADMINISTRATION.

80
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:17,582
WEINSTEIN AND SOME REPORTS WAS

81
00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:18,316
HER BEST FRIEND AND VERY CLOSE

82
00:02:18,316 --> 00:02:20,418
TO HER.

83
00:02:20,418 --> 00:02:21,953
THE THING THAT HAS MADE ALL OF

84
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:23,154
THIS POSSIBLE TO COME OUT

85
00:02:23,154 --> 00:02:25,790
BESIDES RONAN PHARAOH'S GREAT

86
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,524
REPORTING AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS

87
00:02:26,524 --> 00:02:28,059
AS WELL LIKE JANE MEYER IN THIS

88
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:29,894
REPORT IS THE FACT THAT

89
00:02:29,894 --> 00:02:30,461
HILLARY CLINTON LOST.

90
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:34,031
IF SHE HAD WON ALL OF THESE

91
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:36,300
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN STILL

92
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,034
PROTECTED AND THEY WOULD HAVE

93
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:40,738
STILL BEEN VICTIMIZING WOMEN IN

94
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:42,673
MANY INDUSTRIES, BUT CERTAINLY

95
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:44,909
THIS UPPER CRUST OF THE LIBERAL

96
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:45,576
FRAMEWORK WITH MEN AND WOMEN

97
00:02:45,576 --> 00:02:49,947
THAT HAVE PROTECTED THEM WHO

98
00:02:49,947 --> 00:02:50,615
HAVE CONTINUED TO VICTIMIZE

99
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:53,818
WOMEN AND NOW ARE AT A POINT

100
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:55,219
WHERE REALLY, I CONTEND, IN THIS

101
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:57,054
FRAMEWORK, THIS LARGEST OMELETTE

102
00:02:57,054 --> 00:02:59,724
IS THAT IT'S ABOUT THE LIBERAL

103
00:02:59,724 --> 00:03:01,726
IDEOLOGY THAT THE RIGHT HAS BEEN

104
00:03:01,726 --> 00:03:03,160
SO DEMONIZED THAT YOU'VE GOT TO

105
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,596
PROTECT EVERYONE IN YOUR REALM

106
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:06,497
BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT AND

107
00:03:06,497 --> 00:03:07,231
CONSERVATIVES WHO ARE SUPPOSED

108
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:09,700
TO BE THE DEADLY ONES.

109
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,935
AND IT'S HER OWN VICTIMIZERS

110
00:03:10,935 --> 00:03:11,636
THERE ON THE LEFT.

111
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:13,204
>> Tucker: NO ENEMIES ON THE

112
00:03:13,204 --> 00:03:13,504
LEFT.

113
00:03:13,504 --> 00:03:15,106
I'VE SEEN THIS ALL MY LIFE.

114
00:03:15,106 --> 00:03:16,507
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO SAY

115
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:17,341
THAT THERE ARE CREEPY PEOPLE ON

116
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:19,777
BOTH SIDES, THAT'S FOR SURE.

117
00:03:19,777 --> 00:03:20,511
BUT THERE'S ONE STRAIN OF THIS

118
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:21,679
BEHAVIOR THAT REALLY IS

119
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:24,482
PARTICULAR TO THE LEFT AND THAT

120
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:26,317
IS THE OVERWEENING HYPOCRISY.

121
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:28,085
WE ARE ALL HYPOCRITES, I GET IT,

122
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:29,487
BUT THE IDEA THAT THE GUY

123
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:31,989
TELLING YOU YOU CAN'T HAVE A

124
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:32,657
WOODSTOVE BECAUSE OF CARBON

125
00:03:32,657 --> 00:03:33,758
EMISSIONS ARE FLYING IN A

126
00:03:33,758 --> 00:03:34,625
PRIVATE CHAT OR THE PERSON WHO

127
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,528
SAYS YOU CAN OF GUNS AN ARMED

128
00:03:37,528 --> 00:03:38,329
BODYGUARD FOR THE #MeToo

129
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:39,363
ACTIVIST BEATING UP WOMEN.

130
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:41,432
NORMAL PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE THAT

131
00:03:41,432 --> 00:03:42,733
HYPOCRITICAL -- NORMAL PEOPLE

132
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:43,968
COULDN'T DO THAT.

133
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:45,102
I WILL PICK ANOTHER ISSUE.

134
00:03:45,102 --> 00:03:45,970
I KNOW I'M BEATING UP WOMEN SO

135
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,139
I'M NOT GOING TO BE LIKE THE

136
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:49,173
#MeToo SPOKESMAN BUT LIBERALS

137
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:50,308
DO THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN, WHY?

138
00:03:50,308 --> 00:03:52,543
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

139
00:03:52,543 --> 00:03:54,979
>> I WOULD CONTEND THEY DON'T

140
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:55,580
BELIEVE IN THE ISSUES.

141
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,415
ANYMORE THAN BARACK OBAMA CARED

142
00:03:57,415 --> 00:03:58,849
FOR HEALTH CARE OR GETTING RID

143
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:00,918
OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS OR ISIS.

144
00:04:00,918 --> 00:04:01,819
THESE ARE MECHANISMS FOR THEIR

145
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:04,188
OWN POWER.

146
00:04:04,188 --> 00:04:04,889
THEY USE THEM AND ON THE LEFT

147
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:07,692
YOU GET PROTECTED BECAUSE YOU'VE

148
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:08,426
ALREADY CONVINCED EVERYONE ELSE

149
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:09,560
THAT YOU WERE NOT THE ENEMY.

150
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,129
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S HYPOCRISY

151
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:13,264
BECAUSE TO BE A HYPOCRITE I

152
00:04:13,264 --> 00:04:14,065
SUPPOSE YOU HAVE TO KIND OF SORT

153
00:04:14,065 --> 00:04:14,865
OF BELIEVE IN THE ISSUE AND THEN

154
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:16,666
DO THE OPPOSITE.

155
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,303
THEY DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IN IT

156
00:04:19,303 --> 00:04:20,971
AND THIS IS OUR PROBLEM, THAT'S

157
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:23,741
THE LIBERAL PROBLEM NOW IS THAT

158
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:25,009
HAS THIS JUST BEEN A GAME?

159
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,744
DOES NO ONE BELIEVE IN THE

160
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:27,445
ISSUES AND FOR THE WOMEN THAT

161
00:04:27,445 --> 00:04:30,681
HAVE BELIEVED IN IT, LET THIS AT

162
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:31,349
LEAST HOPEFULLY MAYBE BE A

163
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:34,919
CRACK -- YOU WANT A BROKEN GLASS

164
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:35,553
CEILING?

165
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:37,455
IT IS ONLY HAPPENING BECAUSE

166
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:38,155
HILLARY CLINTON LOST AND NOW

167
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:41,525
THERE'S A CHANCE FOR LIBERALS TO

168
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:42,893
BE HONEST AND MAYBE IT'S THE

169
00:04:42,893 --> 00:04:43,394
KANYE WEST THEORY.

170
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:46,497
MAYBE THEY CAN HAVE FOR YOUR

171
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:49,533
MINDS WHICH WILL LEAD TO SAFER

172
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:50,801
LIVES AND GENUINE INDEPENDENCE,

173
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:52,036
WHICH IS WHAT LIBERALS AND

174
00:04:52,036 --> 00:04:55,072
CONSERVATIVES, ALL AMERICANS

175
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:56,307
GENERALLY WANT TOGETHER.

176
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:57,241
WE CAN STOP ALIENATING OURSELVES

177
00:04:57,241 --> 00:04:58,109
FROM EACH OTHER AND COME

178
00:04:58,109 --> 00:04:58,876
TOGETHER FOR THE THINGS THAT WE

179
00:04:58,876 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE IN COMMON.
