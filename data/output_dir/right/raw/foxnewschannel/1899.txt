1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:07,112
ALMOST EVERY SITUATION.

2
00:00:07,112 --> 00:00:09,181
>> Neil: THANKS, RICH.

3
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:10,415
SPEAKING OF CHUCK SCHUMER.

4
00:00:10,415 --> 00:00:12,184
REMEMBER WHEN THE IRANIAN DEAL

5
00:00:12,184 --> 00:00:14,920
WAS CRAFTED BY BARACK OBAMA?

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,256
THIS WAS CHUCK SCHUMER.

7
00:00:17,256 --> 00:00:19,191
>> WE SHOULD NOT GO FORWARD WITH

8
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:19,791
THIS AGREEMENT.

9
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,394
THIS EVIL REGIME HAS STAYED IN

10
00:00:22,394 --> 00:00:24,096
POWER WITHOUT A SLIGHT THREAT TO

11
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:27,032
THEIR BEING OVERTHROWN.

12
00:00:27,032 --> 00:00:32,171
THE ODDS ARE TOO HIGH, TOO HIGH

13
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:42,247
THAT IT WILL STAY FLAWED.

14
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:43,448
>> Neil: THIS DANGEROUS

15
00:00:43,448 --> 00:00:44,816
AGREEMENT, THE EVIL AGREEMENT.

16
00:00:44,816 --> 00:00:46,151
YOU'D THINK WHEN THIS PRESIDENT

17
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:48,253
WALKED AWAY FROM IT, CHUCK

18
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:51,223
SCHUMER WOULD WELCOME IN.

19
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:51,723
OF COURSE.

20
00:00:51,723 --> 00:00:57,496
TAKE A LOOK.

21
00:00:57,496 --> 00:01:00,632
>> THERE'S NO REPORTS THAT IRAN

22
00:01:00,632 --> 00:01:02,467
HAS VIOLATED THE AGREEMENT.

23
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:05,737
>> Neil: ENTER ABBOTT AND

24
00:01:05,737 --> 00:01:06,138
COSTELLO.

25
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:09,541
BUT BACK IN 2015 -- I DON'T

26
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:10,609
KNOW.

27
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:12,110
INCONSISTENCY.

28
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,846
FORMER CIA ANALYST, BUCK SEXTON.

29
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:15,948
BUCK, COME ON.

30
00:01:15,948 --> 00:01:18,617
HE WAS AMONG FOUR SENATORS THAT

31
00:01:18,617 --> 00:01:19,952
WAS AGAINST THIS FOR VALID

32
00:01:19,952 --> 00:01:20,752
REASONS AT THE TIME.

33
00:01:20,752 --> 00:01:22,854
THE HOUSE TOOK IT UP AS A

34
00:01:22,854 --> 00:01:23,255
RESOLUTION.

35
00:01:23,255 --> 00:01:23,956
DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE.

36
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:26,225
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS, CAN

37
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:26,491
YOU?

38
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,093
>> IF YOU'RE CHUCK SCHUMER YOU

39
00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:30,696
THINK YOU CAN.

40
00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:32,431
LOOK, THE IRAN DEAL WITHDRAWAL

41
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:34,132
BY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A PROMISE

42
00:01:34,132 --> 00:01:35,534
KEPT.

43
00:01:35,534 --> 00:01:37,135
I THINK THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT

44
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:38,203
CARE ABOUT CONSTITUTIONALISM,

45
00:01:38,203 --> 00:01:41,173
SEPARATION OF POWERS, WE

46
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:44,676
SHOULDN'T HAVE A PRECEDENT THAT

47
00:01:44,676 --> 00:01:45,944
PRESIDENTS CAN USE THEIR

48
00:01:45,944 --> 00:01:47,546
DISCRETION TO BIND DEALS THAT

49
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:48,547
DON'T GO THROUGH THE SENATE.

50
00:01:48,547 --> 00:01:50,115
THAT'S ANOTHER ADDED BENEFIT OF

51
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:50,415
THIS.

52
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:51,850
ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT IT WAS A

53
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,351
BAD DEAL.

54
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:55,320
DIDN'T DEAL WITH SOME ISSUES

55
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,855
THAT WERE CLEARLY CENTRAL TO

56
00:01:56,855 --> 00:02:00,292
WHAT WE WANT WITH IRAN, WHICH IS

57
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:01,927
DEFANG WHAT WILL BE A NUCLEAR

58
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:03,862
STATE AT SOME POINT IN THE

59
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:04,196
FUTURE.

60
00:02:04,196 --> 00:02:05,597
NORTH KOREA, BY THE WAY, SAYING

61
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:06,999
THIS IS NO BIG DEAL, KIM JONG-UN

62
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:09,033
COULD VERY WELL HAVE HELD ON TO

63
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:10,535
THOSE HOSTAGES TO GIVE HIM

64
00:02:10,535 --> 00:02:11,837
ADDITIONAL LEVERAGE GOING INTO

65
00:02:11,837 --> 00:02:13,005
THIS SUMMIT.

66
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:14,973
I THINK THAT IF HE HAD NO PLANS

67
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:16,675
TO EVEN HEAR TRUMP OUT, THAT

68
00:02:16,675 --> 00:02:18,477
MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE WAY FORWARD

69
00:02:18,477 --> 00:02:18,877
FOR HIM.

70
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:21,813
AT A MINIMUM, IT'S A CONFIDENCE

71
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:23,215
BUILDING MEASURE AND OBVIOUSLY

72
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:24,116
GREAT NEWS FOR THE AMERICAN

73
00:02:24,116 --> 00:02:26,051
PEOPLE AND THE FAMILIES THAT GET

74
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:27,719
BACK THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.

75
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,554
I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE

76
00:02:29,554 --> 00:02:30,656
CHEERFULNESS FROM DEMOCRATS ON

77
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:31,990
THAT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.

78
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,659
>> Neil: YOU KNOW, FOR OBVIOUS

79
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:35,494
REASONS, I HAVE TO ASK YOU A

80
00:02:35,494 --> 00:02:36,762
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING

81
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:37,195
ON.

82
00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:40,198
THE OIL MARKET RESPONSE TO THIS.

83
00:02:40,198 --> 00:02:41,867
SEEMS A LITTLE ARCANE HERE.

84
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:44,069
BUT OIL IS RUNNING UP.

85
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:45,804
STILL AT MULTIYEAR HIGHS.

86
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:48,740
THE FEELING SEEMS TO BE THAT WE

87
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,142
COULD SEE OIL TAKEN OFF THE

88
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:50,475
MARKET.

89
00:02:50,475 --> 00:02:52,744
THE IRANIANS COULD BE IN A WORLD

90
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:54,046
OF HURT HERE.

91
00:02:54,046 --> 00:02:54,413
SANCTIONS.

92
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:55,847
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

93
00:02:55,847 --> 00:02:57,149
IF THE WORLD FINANCIAL MARKETS,

94
00:02:57,149 --> 00:02:58,550
OUR OWN INCLUDED WERE CONCERNED

95
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,786
ABOUT IT, THEY HAD A FUNNY WAY

96
00:03:00,786 --> 00:03:01,853
OF SHOWING IT.

97
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:02,788
WHO IS RIGHT HERE?

98
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:05,190
>> A LOT OF THAT IS PRICED INTO

99
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,124
THIS, NEIL.

100
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:07,626
PEOPLE WERE EXPECTING THAT TRUMP

101
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:09,094
FOR QUITE A WHILE WAS GOING TO

102
00:03:09,094 --> 00:03:10,329
PULL OUT OF THIS DEAL.

103
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:13,432
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CAPACITY OF

104
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:14,933
THE U.S. BECAUSE OF SHALE AND

105
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:16,435
ALSO JUST THE EXCESS CAPACITY ON

106
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:17,636
THE MARKET AROUND THE WORLD

107
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:18,937
RIGHT NOW, I'M NOT SURE THAT

108
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:20,972
ANYONE WOULD EXPECT TO BE A

109
00:03:20,972 --> 00:03:22,774
MAJOR OIL SHOCK FROM IRAN HAVING

110
00:03:22,774 --> 00:03:26,211
ITS CAPACITY TAKEN OFF OF THE

111
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:26,611
MARKET.

112
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:27,713
CERTAINLY FROM A GLOBAL

113
00:03:27,713 --> 00:03:29,114
FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE, TRUMP HAS

114
00:03:29,114 --> 00:03:31,016
DONE SO MUCH THAT I THINK HAS

115
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:33,652
GIVEN THE MARKET THE SENSE OF

116
00:03:33,652 --> 00:03:34,586
STABILITY THAT WE'RE NOT GOING

117
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:35,654
TO SEE SHOCKS FROM THINGS LIKE

118
00:03:35,654 --> 00:03:36,488
THE IRAN DEAL.

119
00:03:36,488 --> 00:03:38,357
WE WON'T SEE PEOPLE ALL OF A

120
00:03:38,357 --> 00:03:39,491
SUDDEN GET SPOOKED.

121
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:41,326
A LOT OF THE CONVENTIONAL

122
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:43,695
WISDOM, THE PEOPLE USING GEO

123
00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:45,831
POLITICS -- OR THAT USE GEO

124
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:46,665
POLITICS FOR A BAROMETER FOR

125
00:03:46,665 --> 00:03:49,234
WHERE THE MARKET IS GOING HAVE

126
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:51,236
BEEN PROVEN WRONG TIME AND TIME

127
00:03:51,236 --> 00:03:51,536
AGAIN.

128
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:53,839
SO THAT FACTORS INTO THE

129
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:54,206
THINKING.

130
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:55,107
>> Neil: SO RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

131
00:03:55,107 --> 00:03:57,309
WHAT IF WE'RE THE ONLY ONES THAT

132
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:57,776
DO THIS?

133
00:03:57,776 --> 00:03:59,578
IN OTHER WORDS, THE FIVE

134
00:03:59,578 --> 00:04:02,647
COUNTRIES THAT SIGNED ON,

135
00:04:02,647 --> 00:04:04,683
ENGLAND, FRANCE, GERMANY, CHINA,

136
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:05,951
THEY DON'T SIGN ON TO WHAT WE'RE

137
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:07,719
DOING AND WE'RE DOING THIS

138
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,520
ALONE, THEN WHAT?

139
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,722
>> I THINK WE HAVE MORE LEVERAGE

140
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:12,090
WITH OUR ALLIES.

141
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,358
PERHAPS THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT

142
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:13,658
WORDS.

143
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:15,093
WE HAVE BETTER WAYS OF

144
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:16,194
ESTABLISHING WITH THEM A MEANS

145
00:04:16,194 --> 00:04:17,428
OF GETTING A NEW DEALS.

146
00:04:17,428 --> 00:04:18,529
KEEP IN MIND, THE TRUMP

147
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:19,798
ADMINISTRATION IS NOT SAYING WE

148
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,565
JUST WANT SANCTIONS WITH IRAN.

149
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:22,901
WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE PLANNED.

150
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:26,171
THEY WANT A RENEGOTIATION OF THE

151
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:26,471
DEAL.

152
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:28,206
PRESIDENT RUN THE RAN AS A

153
00:04:28,206 --> 00:04:28,607
NEGOTIATOR.

154
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:30,475
HE'S GOING TO ALLIES WHERE

155
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:31,977
POMPEO AND THE REST OF THE TEAM

156
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:34,613
AND SAY LOOK, WE HAVE THE UPPER

157
00:04:34,613 --> 00:04:39,618
HAND HERE IN DEALING WITH THE

158
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:40,919
IRANIANS.

159
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:43,889
THEY CAN HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPONS

160
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:44,222
PROGRAM.

161
00:04:44,222 --> 00:04:45,690
THEY CANNOT HAVE BOTH.

162
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,659
WE, MEANING US AND OUR ALLIES,

163
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:50,061
SHOULD BE WORKING TOWARDS THAT

164
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:50,328
END.

165
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:51,530
THAT INCLUDES BALLISTIC MISSILES

166
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,165
AS PART OF THIS.

167
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:55,100
THAT INCLUDES INSPECTIONS OF

168
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,935
MILITARY SITES THAT THE IRANIANS

169
00:04:56,935 --> 00:04:58,570
HAVE THAT WERE EXCLUDED AND NO

170
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,838
SUN SET PROVISIONS.

171
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:01,907
THAT WAS THE FATAL FLAW FROM THE

172
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:02,674
BEGINNING THAT EVERYBODY SAID

173
00:05:02,674 --> 00:05:04,976
AND SAID UNLESS YOU GET A

174
00:05:04,976 --> 00:05:06,611
RADICALLY DIFFERENT REVISION,

175
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:09,014
THE RADICALS WILL BE IN CHARGE.

176
00:05:09,014 --> 00:00:00,000
HOW COULD THIS WORK?
