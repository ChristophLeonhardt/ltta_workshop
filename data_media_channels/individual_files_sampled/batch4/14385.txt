I thought I'd give you the Coles Notes version of her ramblings and dissector crazy commentary to indicate how just about everything she screams about is a leftist tactic to shut is to shut up wrong think and remember folks she's teaching the next generation so for starters as I mentioned earlier the news peg for the men on the street interviews that day was a CBC report stating Hussein had visited Isis websites and upon overhearing this because I wasn't even talking to this woman to begin with she says this can you please not descend into racist things right now please what I'm sorry what did I say that was racist don't come here the rebel really you didn't you don't need to be here right now this is our community did I say anything that was shooter had visited Isis web sites that is not I said CBS in the u.s. I said CBS in the u.s. is reporting that hey the rebel is not okay that is does not represent Canadian values why are you so mad ma'am it this is this is a news report that broke today can I call you back this is not war about I'm sorry this is not what Canada's about Canada is not about racism yeah right off the bat she employs tactic number one of the left the racism card but how is a gunman having links to Isis racist Isis is not a race Islam is not a race in fact Isis will gladly take any recruit who wants to be a jihadi in terms of being a pawn to bring down the society and install that Islamic caliphate as long as you're willing to strap on a suicide bomb and carry out some carnage Isis will accommodate you gotta say this about Isis they just don't discriminate when it comes to recruiting their angels of death and destruction even so that's the thing with the left today every slight or perceives light is racist even if race is completely irrelevant to the issue at hand which brings us to left this tactic number 10 as CBS in the u.s. is reporting that he had yes that's like that's like reporting on Fox they can really fake the rebel fake news fake news what's real news people that actually have a media outlet that is real and not racist CBC is dude yes like CBC it's better it's not perfect but it's definitely better ah yes fake news you see when the messenger is stating something contrarian to the worldview of a leftist then it's just got to be fake news right and how odd that she seems to think that the left of center CBS is just the same as the right-of-center Fox News but that's the crux of the matter isn't it even if a news source that is politically aligned to her worldview reports something that's not in keeping with her viewpoint then it is therefore fake news that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
