Wednesday night Donald Trump was on Air Force One and there were a number of reporters there he had an extended interview with them and originally it was off the record but in an about-face the White House released a partial transcript of those conversations and in a number of different topics it is a lot of fun in some places very scary we're gonna break down both of those here today first the Air Force One comments of Donald Trump on North Korea in China he said this a big thing we have with China was if they could help us with North Korea that would be great they have pressures that are tough pressures and I understand and you know don't forget China over the many years has been at war with Korea you know wars with Korea it's not like oh gee you just do whatever we say they've had numerous wars with Korea and I had not known any of this they have an eight thousand year culture so when they see 1776 to them that's like a modern building the White House was started was essentially built in 1799 to us that's really old to them that's like a super modern building right so you know they've had tremendous conflict over many many centuries with Korea so it's not just like you do this but we're gonna find out what happens that was in response to how China could potentially help us with a nuclear-armed North Korea but we found out a lot of an architecture that's interesting and he thinks the White House is a teardown Whateley fair somebody tells them that the British actually burned it down and we had to rebuild it later right and he's gonna be like God the British knew where China's not gonna have any respect for it okay so I'm actually defend them a little bit believe it or not on this and I know that the bar is now super low right so yes he talks like a child but there's two different issues here one is how he talks into is what he's saying so he you you can't fix how he talks he's he's a child he can't put together sentences it is what it is right and yeah we can have fun with that and it's hard not to right but the question is does he know what he's doing I think that's a much more important point and that's point number two now he gets a lot of facts wrong and a part that John didn't quote he talked about 50 million people good good over the border of China you know there's only 25 million people in North Korea okay and and he says things like he just discovered him because he probably just discovered them like they have an eight thousand year history did you know that yeah yeah we all knew that except you only an extremely strong Christian conservatives gonna be annoyed by that eight thousand year history remark okay big deal so as Trump said it but they changed their entire ideology did we say six thousand eight thousand years old is how old the earth is set up with the Chinese anyway but in the substance of it he's talking about the the issue that China would have with people crossing the border that is true that's very real right and he's talking about how they've had a long history with North Korea South Korea he calls it Korea what were that means right but it's true in naval of course had conflict back and forth and it's complicated to us we all already knew North Korea was incredibly complicated I'm glad that Trump is on to it now and then he realizes that trade is the lever that you have with China and that you have to balance out trade with how tough you want China to be with North Korea and again he just figured it out it turns out you can't just tell China to do something yeah you have to somehow get them there diplomatically etc they're just not gonna listen to you so even though he gets there pretty late and and in some remarkable ways he's not wrong about the substance of the issue on the trade one more quote because it's interesting he goes on we're not gonna read like four or five paragraphs about how all the trade deals we've had with China are terrible they're terrible he makes good deals we've made bad deals he'll make good deals in the future but then he ends with this but the biggest strength we have are these horrendous trade deals like with China that's our strength but we're gonna fix them but in terms of North Korea our strength is trade well if it if it's our biggest strength we really want to fix it at that point oh this is weird to me I know it's just the way he talks but I he talks like that to the reporters and then we make fun of it and that's all well and good but at some point he sits down with the leaders of these states does he talk like of course he does there is no other way this it's not an act and that proof of that is that he didn't even know that this was on was off the red that the reporters thought that this entire press conference on Air Force One was off the record during that time they learned later that it was on the record yeah and he came back and said he was he was surprised that they thought it was off the record yeah and my favorite part of that was the White House officials were like all the record off the record because he's saying crazy stuff later he says even crazier stuff so this is actually like I said it's not totally crazy it's just sounds funny let's get into crazy though okay hold on hold on and then and then so Trump goes back to the his guys and he's like all right where's all the press stories about what I said cuz I thought it was pretty good they're like you know that was pretty good we had that off-the-record he's like no no what are you talking about I want to see that in the press I think so they go back Jesus that was on the record okay go ahead and print it yeah but it just speaks to the way you know this is how he speaks to everybody right off on the record he doesn't even know and he speaks in a certain way all the time help us build independent media together come join us TYT Network comm slash join
