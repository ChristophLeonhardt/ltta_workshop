1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,920
I visualize what
it’s going to feel

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,940
like to stand out in the
arena and I force myself

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,730
to stay 100 percent
focused on my blades

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,290
and my body and my breath.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,490
And the more that I can
dive into the moment,

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,040
the slower it seems
like the time is going.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,860
I can feel the crowd
getting more excited.

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,840
Inevitably, there are times when
I am actually picturing myself

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,759
making mistakes or falling.

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,820
And I have this
little voice saying

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,260
that it’s happened before.

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,280
It could happen again.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,030
I just continue to breathe.

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,437
I watch Zach.

15
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:46,020
Every time that something goes
wrong in my head and every time

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,180
I get distracted by that,
I make myself start over.

17
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,070
Maybe it takes me
an hour or two hours

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,670
to get through the full
program from start to finish,

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,340
visualizing it the way that
I want, but by the end,

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,830
I have the feeling that
I’m more in control.

21
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,590
In my mind, I’m
just putting myself

22
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,820
in a place of commitment.

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,180
We breathe together before.

24
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,530
I try to make everything
tactile so that I’m fully

25
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,260
aware of my body and hers.

26
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,440
Right before the warm
up, I’m in the locker

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:26,050
room tying my skates, and
everything becomes hyper aware.

28
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,745
And I know that I’ve tied
my skates a million times,

29
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:38,700
and yet my feet feel different,
or it doesn’t feel quite right.

30
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,060
I have so much energy going
through my arms and legs.

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,366
I just need to keep moving.

32
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:47,630
I try and take everything in,
and the crowd, the scores,

33
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,630
and all this other stuff,
and I just kind of try

34
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,760
to turn it into a blur.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,820
I don’t try to think
of anything else.

36
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,361
It’s just be.

37
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:53,550
You can’t control.

38
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,900
You have to be in the moment.

39
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,810
You have to live in the moment.

40
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,560
The tighter you squeeze
a fistful of sand,

41
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,720
the more it falls out.

42
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,180
And then they call our
name, and there’s no choice.

43
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,910
You just have to go and
do what you’ve practiced

44
00:02:05,910 --> 00:00:00,000
to do for the last 12 months.
