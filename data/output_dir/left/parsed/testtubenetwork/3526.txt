April 2015
Bujumbura, Burundi
Violent anti-government riots erupt in the
capital of the small African nation.
Protesters are lashing out against President
Pierre Nkurunziza’s third-term bid for office.
They’re calling his nomination illegal since
it violates the country’s two-term limit.
The constitutional clause was implemented
after Burundi’s brutal civil war in 2005.
Human rights activists fear this crisis could
result in yet another war or ethnic massacre.
At least 19 people have been killed, and more
than 50,000 people have fled.
