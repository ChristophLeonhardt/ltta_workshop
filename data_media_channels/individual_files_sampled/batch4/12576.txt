according to the news media the White House is in chaos the administration is falling apart and Donald Trump will never be able to win the Republican nomination for president a way to scratch that last one and little in the election for President awake well anyway let's move on all across this great land from New York to Los Angeles and nowhere in between the mainstream media is declaring that President Donald Trump's administration is in disarray the resignation of michael Flynn reveals a White House that can never possibly match such landmark accomplishments of the last administration as ah wait I'm thinking the guy was in office for eight years he must have accomplished something what was his name again skinny coffee colored guy had a name like a terrorist I forget but to return to the ineffectiveness of the Trump administration the media having scoured the opinions of the populace from 57th Street in Manhattan all the way to 43rd had decided that this is an administration doomed to failure mainstream journalists mendacious race hire says there's absolutely no indication that a man like Donald Trump can succeed mr. race hire was a reporter for The New York Times a former newspaper until he was fired in the latest round of cutbacks there and evicted from his apartment the former reporter for the former paper gave a press conference in his former apartment standing in his underwear before an array of empty wine bottles and saying quote why on earth would anyone think Donald Trump could accomplish anything as president sure he was a successful real estate developer and a TV star and he won his presidential campaign but can he do this mr. race higher then held a cigarette lighter to his backside and caused the flame to explode clear across the room he was immediately hired to work at CNN it's apparently a talent they'd look for their other journalists are now claiming that Trump is mentally ill former blogger Andrew Sullivan speaking from the former bloggers home for the consistently ridiculous told CNN quote Trump is a pathological liar first he said he'd removed the Martin Luther King bus from the Oval Office and it turned out he hadn't then he said he had threatened to invade Mexico when he hadn't then he went on to say he was easing sanctions on Russia which he wasn't unquote when Sullivan was told these were all lies told by journalists rather than Trump he responded quote oh well then maybe it's the journalists were mentally ill that would explain why they never covered the fact that sarah palin hit someone else's baby in her womb for nine months unquote all in all journalists agree that the Trump White House is ineffective dishonest and in disarray has New York Times editor blithering prevarication the third told a room full of former reporters who were packing up their bags after being fired quote hi could tell you stories about the chaos of the White House but unfortunately I don't have time right now

in the swamp we're going to come crawling out an attack him back and they've come after him and taking out michael Flynn or at least help to take out Michael Flynn with weird leaks and all kinds of stuff that's going on that is now being picked up by the press yesterday I said that you got to choose a side because this is what you know they call it the deep state that's a little bit science fictiony your thriller novel II to me but but this is the bureaucratic state that basically thinks it should be able to rule that your toilet is a waterway and therefore the EPA has the right to regulate how you use it I mean this is what these guys think they think they should be regulating without legislation every aspect of your life and when Donald Trump says starts to take that away he's been gutting Obamacare he's just yesterday's help started to gut dodd-frank and absolutely appalling piece of legislation that puts the government in every business you know boardroom in America and he's doing this and these guys are losing their power and they're coming back and they're coming after me I said you have to choose sides whatever you think of Trump you gotta two sides between the state and Trump yesterday Bill Kristol a never Trumper wife well he tweeted this I obviously strongly prefer normal democratic and constitutional politics but if it comes to it i prefer the deep state to the Trump stake well folks that to me that to me is making an idol out of your personal feelings you know he doesn't like Trump he doesn't like the fact that he you know he did everything he could to try and stop him that he made in my opinion a complete and utter fool of himself but that he didn't do anything as bad as choosing this bureaucratic slavery and that's what it is it's a completely unamerican over trumpet it's ridiculous it is ridiculous I don't care what Trump's flaws are so let's take a look at what I'm because there's still a lot of questions it's a little bit of mysterious you remember obviously everyone knows at this point michael Flynn the national security adviser had to resign after he lied to pants apparently about conversations he had had with the Russian ambassador about sanctions that Obama had put on Russia after Russia hacked into our election system and tried to basically skew the election so the big question that the media the media is spinnin this is Russia's taken over our government and the big question they're asking is why it took so long so yesterday Sean Spicer my second favorite person in the administration i really love tense i think that's is great but that's a big spider I just think he got to come out like Justin leather with a whip at this point so hey God and he explains what what was going on so this is the first yeah the number five we've been reviewing and evaluating this issue with respect to general Flynn on a daily basis for a few weeks trying to ascertain the truth we got to a point not based on a legal issue well based on a trust issue where the level of trust between the president and general Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change the president was very concerned that general Flynn had misled the Vice President and others he was also very concerned in light of sensitive subjects dealt with by that position of national security advisers like China North Korea in the Middle East that the president must have complete and unwavering trust for the person in that position the evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation in a series of other questionable instances is what led the president to ask for general Flynn's resignation so you know the one thing that kept asking everybody kept asking the Kellyanne Conway yesterday why did it take so long they they warned you that Flynn would be subject of all nura below Russian blackmail why didn't call the person who warned them was the acting Attorney General Sally Yates who you will remember he had to fire when she refused to enforce his travel ban so Sally Yates was an Obama operative who never should have been there in the first place that he didn't trust her take her advice means nothing to me but the way they're trying to spend this now the New York Times their big headline is today that other other members of trumps campaign had contact with Russia Russian intelligence listen to this story this is from the New York Times a former newspaper phone records an intercepted call show that members of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and other trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election according to for current and former American officials so Obama operatives feeding stuff to the New York Times American law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the communications around the same time they were discovering evidence that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee three of the officials said the intelligence agencies then sought to learn whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking the officials interviewed in recent weeks said that so far they have seen no evidence of such cooperation so they're talking to the Russians Trump had a lot of business dealings with Russian Russia and they especially singled out Paul man afford who has had contact with Russia that I consider unsavory but they were illegal I mean they were completely legal right and they so they said one of the guys was Paul Manafort and they didn't name the other people so of course manna for assistance with Russia I mean the guy was practically you know the publicity guy for the president of the Ukraine and mana fort's response was this is absurd I have no idea what this is referring to I've never knowingly spoken to Russian intelligence officers and I've never been involved with anything to do with the Russian government or the Putin administration or any other issues under investigation today the point is that they talk to businessmen in in Russia the businessmen and the intelligence officers you cannot tell them apart this is this is a nothing burger story okay it's a nothing burger story and and by the way you know spice are also dealt with this there was no illegality involved with what Flynn did there's no reason why this administration even before they come into office can't call up another government even if you don't happen to like the government and say you know we don't like the sanctions that were imposed on you or you know did you hold your fire until we get into office or whatever nothing illegal about this they can do I mean they talk about the Logan act as I said no one's ever been prosecuted no one ever could be prosecuted on it as far as I'm concerned because it violates the First Amendment so okay let's just take a look you remember in 2012 when Obama famously left the mic open when he's talking to the outgoing President Medvedev Medved jamais ever did you have get a lot of ease whatever his name he was going out Putin was coming in and Obama leaned over and was talking about our missile defense system right he was talking about our missile defense system and was caught on a hot mic saying oh I'll have a lot of flexibility after after the next election because it's my last election now I went to play number three cut number 3 which is the waist CBS News covered this story okay here it is President Obama was overheard giving Medvedev a very candid political assessment of his ability to deal with the major problems we between the US and Russia all of the issues can be solved the president told Medvedev but he stressed that it was particularly important for incoming brezin President Vladimir Putin to give him space on the missile defense system which the US and NATO want to install in Europe my life so much lately yes and after my election I have more question Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney said the overheard remark signaled that the president plans to cave to Russia on missile defense that is an alarming and troubling development this is no time for our president to be pulling his punches with the American people White House officials shrugged off Republican criticism as campaign rhetoric but Scott they did acknowledge the president's remarks and in the statement they said since 2012 is an election year in both countries it's clearly not a year in which we are going to achieve a breakthrough and you can't see it in this cut but Scott Pelley the anchorman and a Democrat hack his smirking was the whole thing he's rocking are not like spam campaign rhetoric it's also now listen to Chuck Todd covering remember remember these sanctions that we're talking about these sanctions were imposed by Obama as a political ploy to basically be legitimize the election of Donald Trump they were jus was just making a big fuss over this hacking into the election you know he was making a big show of it which we would never have done it he would never have done it I don't think if hillary was elected here's Chuck Todd covering Flynn's resignation good evening I'm checked out here in Washington welcome to MTV daily and welcome to day one of what is arguably the biggest presidential scandal involving a foreign government since iran-contra take a breath hyperbole aside folks hunker down because this is a class five political hurricane Getty not putting in our missile defense system you know whispering to the Russians that we don't worry about it I'm not going to put in the missile defense system that's just campaign rhetoric but having a perfectly legal conversation with you know the Russian ambassador about some silly sanctions that's a class-five hurricane the worst thing since iran-contra that the only scandal they covered because it was written scandal that's the only reason he knows it happened he doesn't know about any of the scandals without enduring Obama hey we're going to do the mailbag on the other side of the break but you got to come to the daily wire calm to hear it or you can subscribe and you can watch the whole show on the site and put your questions in for next week
