1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,620
the Academy Awards gets it wrong way

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,870
more than they get it right I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,130
at the list of some of these best

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,950
picture winners crash Shakespeare in

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,250
Love Chicago I mean come<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and they'll</font>

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,870
probably get it wrong again this year

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,150
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a knock on the nominees</font>

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,920
but I can't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't even</font>

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,050
nominate what I consider to be the best

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,560
movie of 2014 the<font color="#CCCCCC"> interview and I'll</font>

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,869
tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> why yes I'll admit the pic is</font>

12
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,420
partially motivated by politics the

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,980
filmmakers made a<font color="#E5E5E5"> classic piece of</font>

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">satire in the tradition of chaplains the</font>

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,640
Strangelove both of which were nominated

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,530
for Best Picture the interview

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely paid a price for taking risks</font>

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">the retaliatory sony hat cost the studio</font>

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,090
millions and ended at least one

21
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,059
high-profile career but to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sony's credit</font>

22
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,250
they made the movie anyway and what they

23
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,110
may it is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the funniest comedies</font>

24
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,149
I've seen in<font color="#CCCCCC"> years I've seen it three</font>

25
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:59,000
times now and it gets better every time

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,219
my favorite line of the year liking<font color="#E5E5E5"> Katy</font>

27
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,248
<font color="#E5E5E5">Perry and drinking margaritas is gay who</font>

28
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:07,679
wants to be straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh not me bor-ring</font>

29
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:10,079
another reason it's my pick for best of

30
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">the year is that it provided me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

31
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,119

escape it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was New Year's Day my alabama</font>

33

34
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:23,700
crushing our hopes of winning a national

35
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,100
championship when the game ended my

36
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,899
friends and I immediately rented the

37
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:31,380
interview on<font color="#E5E5E5"> iTunes and it helped it</font>

38
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,810
helped me forget

39
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,000
and that's what movies are supposed to

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">do somehow the Academy missed that this</font>

41
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,130
year but I sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> as hell didn't</font>
