>>>  WE WANT TO TAKE YOU NOW TO 
THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU THERE 
NOW. 
>> TRAINING PROGRAM CALLED 
MERGING LEADERS. 
IT'S AN ADAPTATION OF THAT 
PROGRAM FOR OUR VETERANS 
HELPING THEM TRANSITION FROM 
MILITARY LIFE INTO PRIVATE 
SECTOR IF THEY DESIRE TO START 
THEIR OWN JOBS AND THEIR OWN 
COMPANIES AND BE ENTREPRENEURS. 
SO ONCE AGAIN WE THANK THE 
PRESIDENT VERY MUCH FOR THIS 
AND IT WILL BE PUT TO VERY GOOD 
USE. 
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. 
>> THANK YOU, ADMINISTRATOR 
MCMAHON. 
NOW I'D LIKE TO BRING UP 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER 
AMBASSADOR JOHN BOLTON TO 
DISCUSS THE WITHDRAWAL FROM THE 
OPTIONAL PROTOCOL AND DISPUTE 
RESOLUTION TO THE VIENNA 
CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS. 
TAKE SOME QUESTIONS AFTER SOME 
REMARKS, AND THEN I'LL BE UP TO 
TAKE QUESTIONS OF THE DAY. 
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 
EARLIER TODAY SECRETARY OF 
STATE POMPEO MADE A VERY 
IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT 
REGARDING THE PRESIDENT'S 
DECISION TO TERMINATE THE 1955 
TREATY OF AMITY WITH IRAN, A 
TREATY IRAN MADE A MOCKERY OF 
WITH ITS SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM, 
PROVOCATIVE BALLISTIC MISSILE 
PROLIFERATION AND MALINED 
BEHAVIOR -- MA LINED BEHAVIOR 
THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST. 
TODAY'S DECISION BY THE 
INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE 
WAS A DEFEAT FOR IRAN. 
IT CORRECTLY REJECTED NEARLY 
ALL OF IRAN'S REQUESTS, BUT WE 
ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE 
I.C.J. 
FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT HAS 
NO JURISDICTION TO ISSUE ANY 
ORDER WITH RESPECT TO SANCTIONS 
THE UNITED STATES IMPOSES TO 
PROTECT ITS OWN ESSENTIAL 
SECURITY UNDER THE TREATY. 
INSTEAD THE COURT ALLOWED IRAN 
TO USE IT AS A FORM FOR 
PROPAGANDA. 
THE IRANIAN REGIME HAS 
SYSTEMICALLY PURSUED A POLICY 
OF HOSTILITY TOWARDS THE UNITED 
STATES THAT DEFAMES THE CENTRAL 
PREMISE OF THE TREATY OF AMITY. 
THE REGIME CANNOT PRACTICE 
ANIMOSITY IN ITS CONDUCT AND 
THEN ASK FOR AMITY UNDER 
INTERNATIONAL LAW. 
IN ADDITION TO THE TREATY OF 
AMITY, I AM ANNOUNCING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS DECIDED THAT THE 
UNITED STATES WILL WITHDRAWAL 
FROM THE OPTIONAL PROTOCOL AND 
DISPUTE RESOLUTION TO THE 
VIENNA CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS. 
THIS IS IN CONNECTION WITH A 
CASE BROUGHT BY THE SO-CALLED 
STATE OF PALESTINE NAMING THE 
UNITED STATES AS A DEFENDANT, 
CHALLENGING OUR MOVE OF OUR 
EMBASSY FROM TEL AVIV TO 
JERUSALEM. 
THE UNITED STATES REMAINS A 
PARTY TO THE UNDERLYING VIENNA 
CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS, AND WE EXPECT ALL 
OTHER PARTIES TO ABIDE BY THEIR 
INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER 
THE CONVENTION. 
OUR ACTIONS TODAY ARE 
CONSISTENT WITH THE DECISIONS 
PRESIDENT REAGAN MADE IN THE 
1980s IN THE WAKE OF THE 
POLITICIZED SUITS AGAINST THE 
UNITED STATES BY NICARAGUA, TO 
TERMINATE OUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE 
OPTIONAL COMPULSORY 
JURISDICTION OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE 
UNDER ARTICLE 362 OF THE I.C.J. 
STATUTE AND HIS DECISION TO 
WITHDRAW FROM A BILATERAL 
TREATY WITH NICARAGUA. 
IT IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE 
DECISION PRESIDENT BUSH MADE IN 
2005 TO WITHDRAW FROM THE 
OPTIONAL PROTOCOL TO THE VIENNA 
CONVENTION ON CONSULAR 
RELATIONS FOLLOWING THE 
I.C.J.'S INFERENCE IN OUR 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. 
SO OUR ACTIONS TODAY DEAL WITH 
THE TREATIES AND CURRENT 
LITIGATION INVOLVING THE UNITED 
STATES BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL 
COURT OF JUSTICE. 
GIVEN THIS HISTORY AND IRAN'S 
ABUSE OF THE I.C.J., WE WILL 
COMMENCE A REVIEW OF ALL 
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS THAT 
MAY STILL EXPOSE THE UNITED 
STATES TO PURPORTED BINDING 
JURISDICTION DISPUTE RESOLUTION 
IN THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF 
JUSTICE. 
THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT SIT 
IDLY BY AS BASELESS POLITICIZED 
CLAIMS ARE BROUGHT AGAINST US. 
THAT CONCLUDES THE STATEMENT. 
I'D BE HAPPY TO TRY AND ANSWER 
A FEW QUESTIONS. 
YES, SIR. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 
AMBASSADOR. 
IN RESPONSE TO THE ACTIONS THAT 
YOU'VE JUST ANNOUNCED, IRAN'S 
FOREIGN MINISTER HAS TOLD THE 
U.S. -- HAS CALLED THE SUT AN 
OUTLAW REGIME. 
I WANT TO ASK YOU THAT. 
AND I ALSO WANTED TO ASK YOU, 
IF I MAY, MR. AMBASSADOR, WITH 
NORTH KOREA ABOUT THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE SECRETARY 
OF STATE IS GOING TO BE 
TRAVELING TO PYONGYANG. 
DO YOU TRUST KIM JONG-UN? 
DO YOU PERSONALLY TRUST KIM 
JONG-UN? 
>> WELL, WITH RESPECT TO 
QUESTIONS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF 
OUR WITHDRAWAL FROM THESE TWO 
TREATIES, I'M GOING TO PASS ON 
THOSE BECAUSE WE WANT TO 
EMPHASIZE THE STEPS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT AUTHORIZED IN 
CONNECTION WITH THOSE TWO 
TREATIES. 
YOU KNOW, IRAN IS A ROGUE 
REGIME, IT HAS BEEN A THREAT 
THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST, NOT 
ONLY FOR ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
AND BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAMS, 
BUT ITS ACTED FOR DECADES AS 
THE CENTRAL BANKER OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND ITS 
HOSTILE AND AGGRESSIVE MILITARY 
BEHAVIOR IN THE REGION TODAY IS 
A BREACH OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE 
AND SECURITY. 
SO I DON'T TAKE WHAT THEY SAY 
SERIOUSLY AT ALL. 
SIR. 
>>REPORTER:  TWO QUESTIONS FOR 
YOU. 
FIRST, ARE THERE ANY PRACTICAL 
 SECOND, ARE YOU 
AT ALL CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
PEOPLE OF IRAN'S -- [ INAUDIBLE 
] 
>> LOOK. 
OUR DISPUTE IS WITH THE 
AYATOLLAHS WHO HAVE TAKEN IRAN 
FROM A RESPECTED POSITION IN AN 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO 
BEING A ROGUE STATE, OUR 
DISPUTE HAS NEVER BEEN WITH THE 
PEOPLE OF IRAN. 
WE ONLY WISH THEY HAD THE 
ABILITY TO CONTROL THEIR OWN 
GOVERNMENT. 
>>REPORTER:  AND THEN ON THE 
INTERSECTION PART? 
>> NO, IT WON'T HAVE ANY EFFECT 
ON THAT. 
SIR. 
>>REPORTER:  MR. AMBASSADOR, 
CANCELING THOSE TWO TREATIES, 
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT 
ARE THE OPEN PATH FOR POTENTIAL 
TALKS YOU STILL HAVE WITH IRAN 
AND ACTUALLY THE PALESTINIANS? 
>> THIS IS REALLY -- THIS 
REALLY HAS LESS TO DO WITH IRAN 
AND THE PALESTINIANS THAN WITH 
THE CONTINUED CONSISTENT POLICY 
OF THE UNITED STATES TO REJECT 
THE JURISDICTION OF THE 
INTERNATINAL COURT OF JUSTICE 
WHICH WE THINK IS POLITICIZED 
AND INEFFECTIVE. 
IT RELATES OBVIOUSLY IN PART TO 
OUR VIEWS ON THE INTERNATIONAL 
CRIMINAL COURT AND THE NATURE 
OF SO-CALLED PURPORTED 
INTERNATIONAL COURTS TO BE ABLE 
TO BIND THE UNITED STATES. 
SIR. 
>>REPORTER:  IT IS CLOSING 
DOORS IN THE END. 
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO -- 
>> IT'S CLOSING DOORS THAT 
SHOULDN'T BE OPEN TO 
POLITICIZED ABUSE WHICH IS WHAT 
WE'VE CONSISTENTLY SEEN IN THE 
I.C.J. 
JOHN. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 
AMBASSADOR. 
AS YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY THE 
FRENCH GOVERNMENT DENOUNCED THE 
IRANIAN GOVERNMENT OR A TERROR 
PLOT IN PARIS AGAINST THE 
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF IRANIAN 
RESISTANCE, LEADING GROUP 
OPPOSING THE AYATOLLAHS. 
YOU'RE AWARE -- WAS THAT A 
FACTOR IN ANY OF THE DECISION 
THAT YOU'VE MADE WITHDRAWING 
FROM THESE TWO PROTOCOLS? 
>> NO. 
THESE DECISIONS WERE MADE 
BEFORE WE WERE AWARE OF THE 
FRENCH DECISION. 
BUT I HAVE TO SAY WHAT THE 
FRENCH HAVE DONE IS EXACTLY THE 
RIGHT THING. 
THEY ARRESTED AND OTHER 
EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS ARRESTED 
ACCREDITED IRANIAN DIPLOMATS, 
ACCREDITED IRANIAN DIPLOMATS 
FOR CONSPIRACY TO CONDUCT THIS 
ATTEMPTED ASSAULT ON THE RALLY 
IN PARIS. 
SO THAT TELLS YOU I THINK 
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW 
ABOUT HOW THE GOVERNMENT OF 
IRAN VIEWS ITS RESPONSIBILITIES 
IN CONNECTION WITH DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS, AND I HOPE IT'S A 
WAKEUP CALL ACROSS EUROPE TO 
THE NATURE OF THE REGIME AND 
THE THREAT THAT THEY POSE. 
MA'AM. 
>>REPORTER:  ARE THESE ACTIONS 
RAMPING UP TENSIONS BETWEEN THE 
UNITED STATES AND IRAN? 
AND WHAT IS OUR INTELLIGENCE 
WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR SYSTEMS 
THERE, THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS, 
ET CETERA, AT THIS MOMENT? 
>> WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO GET 
INTO WHAT OUR INTELLIGENCE 
STATES, BUT THE ISSUE IS 
PROTECTING THE UNITED STATES 
AGAINST THE POLITICIZED USE OF 
THESE INTERNATIONAL 
INSTITUTIONS. 
AS I'VE SAID, THIS GOES BACK 
NOW CLOSE TO OVER 30 YEARS 
REALLY IN CONNECTION WITH U.S. 
POLICY OF REJECTING 
JURISDICTION OF THESE COURTS, 
AND IT'S A CONTINUATION I THINK 
IN THE INTEREST OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
>>REPORTER:  SO DOES THIS 
PROVIDE ANY KIND OF ATTEMPT TO 
TRY TO COME TOGETHER ON WHAT 
WAS TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM IN 
CLOSING -- 
>> THEY'RE BRINGING A LAWSUIT 
AGAINST US IN IN THE I.C.J., IT 
HAS NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH 
A DIPLOMATIC EFFORT TO RESOLVE 
OUR DIFFERENCES. 
IT WAS A POLITICIZED USE OF THE 
COURT THAT EXACERBATED THE USE 
OF THE DIFFERENCES. 
MA'AM. 
>>REPORTER:  CAN YOU RESPOND TO 
THE IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
THAT THE U.S. IS DRIVEN BY 
REGIME CHANGE? 
>> I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, MAYBE 
LISTEN THIS TIME. 
OUR POLICY IS NOT REGIME 
CHANGE, BUT WE DO EXPECT 
SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN THEIR 
BEHAVIOR. 
THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT HAS 
DIRECTED ALL OF US IN THE 
GOVERNMENT TO COME UP WITH 
STEPS TO REIMPOSE THE ECONOMIC 
SANCTIONS AND TO DO WHATEVER 
ELSE IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE WE 
BRING MAXIMUM PRESSURE ON THE 
REGIME TO STOP ITS MALIGNED 
BEHAVIOR ACROSS THE BOARD, NOT 
JUST IN THE NUCLEAR FIELD, BUT 
ACROSS THE BOARD. 
>>REPORTER:  THE E.U. 
AND OTHER PARTNERS ARE STILL 
PART OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL, DOES 
IT MAKE THE UNITED STATES' 
EFFORTS TO TRY TO FORCE IRAN TO 
ABANDON OR AT LEAST TRY TO 
DISMANTLE IGHTS NUCLEAR PROGRAM 
ANY WEAKER -- ITS NUCLEAR 
PROGRAM ANY WEAKER? 
>> I DON'T THINK IRAN IS 
DSMANTLING ITS NUCLEAR 
PROGRAM. 
IF ANYTHING, RECENT REPORTS 
THAT ARE PUBLIC INDICATE IT'S 
INCREASING THEIR ACTIVITY. 
>>REPORTER:  HOW DO YOU 
CONVINCE YOU DON'T HAVE THE 
E.U. 
PARTNERS ON BOARD. 
>> WELL, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO 
APPLY THE MAXIMUM AMOUNTOF 
LEVERAGE THAT WE CAN. 
WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR EUROPEAN 
PARTNER, THE BRITISH, THE 
FRENCH, THE GERMANS AND THE 
OTHERS. 
THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO REMAIN IN 
THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. 
BUT AS I'VE SAID TO THEM, IT 
WAS LIKE A BOOK THAT WAS 
WRITTEN SEVERAL DECADES AGO AND 
THIS COUNTRY WAS SOMETHING 
CALLED LIKE THE SIX STAGES OF 
GRIEF. 
FIRST YOU HAVE DENIAL, THEN YOU 
HAVE ANGER, EVENTUALLY YOU GET 
TO ACCEPTANCE. 
I THINK THAT'S THE DIRECTION 
THE EUROPEANS ARE MOVING IN. 
I CAN TELL YOU EUROPEAN 
COMPANIES IN DROVES ARE 
FORESWEARING BUSINESS 
OPPORTUNITIES IN IRAN BECAUSE 
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE CAUGHT UP 
IN THE PRESSURE CAMPAIGN THAT 
WE'RE APPLYING. 
>>REPORTER:  MR. AMBASSADOR, 
YOU JUST ADDRESSED PALESTINE 
AND SAID IT IS A SO-CALLED 
STATE. 
IS THAT LANGUAGE PRODUCTIVE IN 
ACHIEVING THE PRESIDENT'S -- 
BUT THE PRESIDENT RECOMMITTED 
TO -- THE PRESIDENT IN NEW YORK 
CITY AS YOU KNOW RECOMMITTED 
HIS GOAL TO ACHIEVING A TWO-
STATE SOLUTION. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
>>REPORTER:  SO IS USING THAT 
SORT OF LANGUAGE PRODUCTIVE IN 
HIS GOAL? 
>> YEAH, SURE, OF COURSE. 
IT'S NOT A STATE NOW. 
IT DOES NOT MEET THE CUSTOMARY 
INTERNATIONAL LAW TEST OF 
STATEHOOD. 
IT DOESN'T CONTROL DEFINED 
BOUNDARIES, IT DOESN'T FULFILL 
THE NORMAL FUNCTIONS OF 
GOVERNMENT. 
THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF 
REASONS WHY IT'S NOT A STATE. 
IT COULD BECOME A STATE AS THE 
PRESIDENT SAID, BUT THAT 
REQUIRES DIPLOMATIC 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAEL AND 
OTHERS. 
SO CALLING IT THE SO-CALLED 
STATE OF PALESTINE DEFINES 
EXACTLY WHAT IT HAS BEEN, A 
POSITION THAT THE UNITED STATES 
GOVERNMENT HAS PURSUED 
UNIFORMLY SINCE 1988 WHEN THE 
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY DECLARED 
ITSELF TO BE THE STATE OF 
PALESTINE. 
WE DON'T RECOGNIZE IT AS THE 
STATE OF PALESTINE, WE HAVE 
CONSISTENTLY ACROSS DEMOCRATIC 
AND REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS 
OPPOSED THE ADMISSION OF 
PALESTINE. 
IT'S NOT A STATE. 
>> THE I.A.E.A. 
IS SAYING IT DOESN'T TAKE ON 
FACE VALUE THAT NETANYAHU'S 
CLAIMS THAT IRAN IS HARBORING A 
SECRET ATOMIC WAREHOUSE. 
DO YOU AGREE WITH THE ISRAELI 
PRIME MINISTER THAT THIS SHOULD 
-- THERE SHOULD BE AN 
INSPECTION AND WHAT'S YOUR 
REACTION TO THE COMMENTS? 
>> WELL, I HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE 
COMMENTS. 
I WILL SAY WE HAVE BEEN -- OUR 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN 
REVIEWING THE MATERIAL THAT 
ISRAEL EXTRACTED FROM IRAN AND 
GOING OVER IT IN QUITE SOME 
DETAIL, AND I'LL SAY IT'S 
EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE, AND WE'VE 
BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE 
ISRAELI EFFORT AND SUPPORTIVE 
OF THE I.A.E.A. 
TAKING NEW STEPS TO FOLLOW UP 
ON IT. 
THE SENATE JUST CONFIRMED A FEW 
DAYS AGO, AMBASSADOR JACKIE 
WALCOTT WHO WILL BE TAKING UP 
HER NEW POSITION AS U.S. 
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. AGENCIES 
IN VIENNA, SPECIFICALLY THE 
INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY 
AGENCY AND SHE'LL BE ON THE JOB 
SHORTLY MAKING OUR CASE THERE. 
SIR. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, SIR. 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT IN 
SUPPORT OF A TWO-STATE SOLUTION 
AT THE U.N. LAST WEEK, PRIME 
MINISTER NETANYAHU RESPONDED 
HE'S CONFIDENT ISRAEL WOULD 
RETAIN SECURITY CONTROL OF THE 
WEST BANK UNDER ANY WHITE HOUSE 
PLAN. 
IS THAT CORRECT, OR ARE YOU 
OPEN TO A PALESTINIAN STATE 
WITH NO SECURITY PRESENCE FROM 
ISRAEL INSIDE THEIR BORDER? 
>> WE'VE BEEN WORKING, AS YOU 
WELL KNOW, ON A PEACE PLAN 
INVOLVING ISRAEL AND THE 
PALESTINIANS. 
WE'LL BE ROLLING IT OUT IN DUE 
COURSE WHEN WE DECIDE IT'S THE 
MOST APPROPRIATE TIME TO DO IT, 
AND I'M SURE THAT WILL ANSWER 
YOUR QUESTION. 
AND I SEE A LADY OVER HERE. 
>> WE'LL TAKE ONE LAST 
QUESTION. 
>> I'M SORRY. 
I ACTUALLY DID TRY TO RECOGNIZE 
THIS GENTLEMAN. 
I GUESS I DIDN'T POINT 
ACCURATELY ENOUGH. 
SO MY APOLOGIES. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, 
AMBASSADOR. 
FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN 
KERRY YESTERDAY SAID HE HAS NOT 
MET WITH THE IRANIANS SINCE THE 
U.S. PULLED OUT OF THE DEAL, 
BUT HE HAS MET WITH THEM ON 
SEVERAL OCCASIONS BEFORE. 
DO YOU THINK HE VIOLATED THE 
LOGAN ACT BY DOING SO AND WAS 
HE SUBVERTING THE POLICY OF THE 
UNITED STATES? 
>> WELL, I THINK SECRETARY 
POMPEO ADDRESSED THAT 
PREVIOUSLY AND I'LL STICK WITH 
HIS REMARKS. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> THANK YOU, AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON. 
A COUPLE OF QUICK REMINDERS. 
FEMA IN COORDINATION WITH THE 
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS 
COMMISSION WILL CONDUCT A 
NATIONWIDE INTEGRATED PUBLIC 
ALERT AND WARNING SYSTEM TEST 
OF THE EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM 
AND THE WIRELESS EMERGENCY 
ALERTS LATER TODAY. 
THIS WILL TAKE PLACE IN TWO 
PARTS, THE W.E.A. 
PORTION STARTING AT 2:18 P.M. 
EASTERN FOLLOWED BY THE E.A.S. 
PORTION AT 2:20 P.M. 
EASTERN. 
THIS IS THE FIRST NATIONWIDE 
W.E.A. 
TEST AND THE FOURTH FOR THE 
E.A.S. 
THE OVERALL TEST WILL ASSESS 
THE OPERATIONAL READINESS OF 
THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR 
DISTRIBUTION OF A NATIONAL 
MESSAGE AND DETERMINE WHETHER 
TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE 
NEEDED. 
LOOKING AHEAD TO MONDAY, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL TRAVEL TO 
ORLANDO, FLORIDA TO ADDRESS THE 
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
CHIEFS OF POLICE. 
AS THE LARGEST GATHERING OF 
OLICE LEADERS, THE PRESIDENT 
WILL SPEAK ABOUT THE WORK OF 
THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROTECT 
AMERICAN COMMUNITIES BY 
RESTORING LAW AND ORDER, 
SUPPORTING LOCAL LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AND SECURING THE 
BORDER. 
LASTLY, ON THE NIGHT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP NOMINATED JUDGE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, SENATOR SCHUMER 
DECLARED THAT DEMOCRATS WOULD 
OPPOSE THIS NOMINATION WITH 
EVERYTHING THEY HAD. 
BEFORE A SINGLE DOCUMENT WAS 
PRODUCED, A SINGLE MEETING WITH 
A SENATOR OR A HEAR WAS EVER 
SCHEDULED, CHUCK SCHUMER AND 
THE SENATE DEMOCRATS 
TELEGRAPHED A STRATEGY TO THROW 
THE KITCHEN SINK AT THE JUDGE 
WITH NO REGARD FOR THE PROCESS, 
DECENCY OR STANDARDS. 
THEY'RE NOT OPPOSED TO JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S JUDICIAL VIEW, 
THEY'RE LITERALLY TRYING TO 
UNDERCUT THE VOICE OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN THEY 
ELECTED DONALD TRUMP. 
THEY HAVE QUESTIONED HIS 
LEGITIMACY AND CASUALLY TOSSED 
AROUND VICIOUS ACCUSATIONS OF 
PERJURY, ALL FALSE AND 
BASELESS. 
BUT NOW THEY'VE SUNK LOWER AS 
THEY SPRANG THESE 11th-HOUR 
ACCUSATIONS AND A FULL-SCALE 
ASSAULT ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
INTEGRITY. 
THIS IS A COORDINATED SMEAR 
CAMPAIGN. 
NO EVIDENCE, NO INDEPENDENT 
CORROBORATION, JUST SMEARS. 
HERE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE 
EXAMPLES. 
CHUCK SCHUMER SAID, AND I 
QUOTE, THERE'S NO PRESUMPTION 
OF INNOCENCE OR GUILT. 
CHRIS WHO SITS ON THE COMMITTEE 
SAID KAVANAUGH, AND I QUOTE, 
NOW BEARS THE BURDEN OF 
DISPROVING THESE ALLEGATIONS, 
RATHER THAN DR. FORD AND MS. 
RAMIREZ. 
MAZIE HIRONO WHO ALSO SITS ON 
THE COMMITTEE SAID THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH DOES NOT DESERVE THE 
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE 
BECAUSE OF HIS JUDICIAL VIEWS. 
ONE THING IS CLEAR, DEMOCRATS 
WANT TO BLOCK KAVANAUGH AND 
HOLD THIS SEAT OPEN UNTIL THE 
2020 ELECTION. 
THIS IS ABOUT POLITICS AND THIS 
IS ABOUT POWER, PURE AND 
1EU6R7LE. 
AND THEY'VE DESTROYED JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S REPUTATION, 
UNDERMINED DR. FORD'S PRIVACY 
AND TRIED TO UPEND OUR 
TRADITIONS OF INNOCENT UNTIL 
PROVEN GUILTY IN THE PROCESS. 
IT'S A COMPLETE AND TOTAL 
DISGRACE. 
WE WILL RECEIVE AND SUBMIT THE 
F.B.I.'S SUPPLEMENTAL 
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION ON HIS 
NOMINATION TO THE SENATE. 
úAS L 
KAVANAUGH DESERVES A PROMPT 
VOTE AND WE EXPECT HIM TO GET 
ONE. 
AND WITH THAT I'LL TAKE YOUR 
QUESTIONS. 
JOHN. 
>>REPORTER:  SARAH, THE THREE 
PEOPLE WHO WERE MOST IMPORTANT 
IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS ARE 
SENATORS MURKOWSKI, COLLINS AND 
FLAKE. 
THIS MORNING TWO OF THOSE 
SENATORS, FLAKE AND COLLINS 
WERE EXTREMELY UPSET ABOUT HOW 
THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD AT THAT 
RALLY IN MISSISSIPPI. 
KNOWING HOW SENSITIVE THIS 
ISSUE IS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT 
WOULD BE IF THE F.B.I. 
INVESTIGATION SHOWS NO OTHER 
COMPELLING EVIDENCE TO KEEP 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH FROM THE COURT 
THAT THESE PEOPLE NEED TO BE 
COMFORTABLE WITH VOTING FOR, 
WHY DID THE PRESIDENT SAY WHAT 
HE DID LAST NIGHT IN THE WAY 
THAT HE SAID IT? 
>> THE PRESIDENT WAS STATING 
THE FACTS, AND, FRANKLY, FACTS 
-- AND, FRANKLY, FACTS THAT 
WERE SHOWN IN MITCHELL'S 
REPORT. 
THE SENATE HAS TO MAKE A 
DECISION BASED ON THOSE FACTS 
AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY SEEN 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO BE QUALIFIED 
TO HOLD THE POSITION ON THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
EVERY SINGLE WORD JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH HAS SAID HAS BEEN 
PICKED APART, EVERY SINGLE 
WORD, SECOND BY SECOND OF HIS 
TESTIMONY HAS BEEN PICKED 
APART, YET IF ANYBODY SAYS 
ANYTHING ABOUT THE ACCUSATIONS 
THAT HAVE BEEN THROWN AGAINST 
THEM, THAT'S TOTALLY OFF LIMITS 
AND OUTRAGEOUS. 
THIS ENTIRE PROCESS HAS BEEN A 
DISGRACE AND THE ONLY REASON 
THAT IT'S BEEN THAT WAY IS 
BECAUSE SENATE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T 
DO THIS THE WAY THAT IT SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN DONE, AND THEY CIRCUM 
VENTED THE ENTIRE SYSTEM, AND, 
FRANKLY, THEY'VE UNDERMINED AN 
ENTIRE JUDICIAL BRANCH BY THE 
WAY THEY'VE ACTED AND THE 
INAPPROPRIATENESS THEY'VE 
CONDUCTED THEMSELVES. 
>>REPORTER:  YOU'RE POINTING 
OUT INCONSISTIES IN IS ONE 
THING, BUT THE TONE THE 
PRESIDENT DID IT LAST NIGHT 
CLEARLY HAD A KEY AFFECT ON TWO 
KEY SWING VOTES FOR HIS 
NOMINATION. 
IS THE PRESIDENT -- 
>> THE PRESIDENT IS VERY 
CONFIDENT IN HIS NOMINEE, AS HE 
STATED TIME AND TIME AGAIN, AND 
WE EXPECT THE SENATE TO VOTE 
AND WE HOPE THEY DO THAT SOON. 
ZEKE. 
>>REPORTER:  TWO QUICK WEES 
ABOUT KAVANAUGH. 
FIRST, DOES THE WHITE HOUSE 
HAVE ANY RESPONSE TO THE 
REPORTS ABOUT RICIN TO PENTAGON 
OFFICIALS, HAS THE PRESIDENT 
BEEN BRIEFED? 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS CERTAINLY 
BEEN MADE AWARE, BUT AS WE 
STATED YESTERDAY, I WOULD REFER 
YOU TO THE U.S. SECRET SERVICE 
TO RESPOND TO THOSE. 
>>REPORTER:  DO YOU HAVE 
ANYTHING ON THE PRESIDENT'S 
MEETING WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL 
ROD ROSENSTEIN THAT WAS 
SUPPOSED TO BE LAST WEEK? 
>> AGAIN, WE DON'T HAVE ANY 
UPDATES ON THAT FRONT. 
IF THERE'S A MEETING WE'LL LET 
YOU KNOW, BUT AT THIS POINT 
THEY CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER 
AND BOTH SHOW UP EVERYDAY AND 
DO THEIR JOBS. 
>>REPORTER:  ONE MORE. 
YOU SAID A COUPLE MINUTES AGO [ 
INAUDIBLE  ] FOR UNDERMINING 
DR. FORD'S PRIVACY AND THE 
PRESIDENT  
PRESIDENT OUT ON STAGE LAST 
NIGHT ESSENTIALLY MOCKING HER. 
>> NOT AT ALL. 
WE'RE POINTING OUT THE 
HYPOCRISY. 
AGAIN, NONE OF THIS WOULD BE 
TAKING PLACE IF DEMOCRATS HAD 
DONE THIS IN A NORMAL ORDER AND 
NOT EXPLOITED DR. FORD AND 
ATTACKED JUDGE KAVANAUGH IN 
SUCH A PUBLIC MANNER. 
ALL OF THIS COULD HAVE BEEN 
HANDLED COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY 
AND THE SENATE DEMOCRATS HOLD 
ALL OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
THAT PROCESS. 
JOSH. 
>>REPORTER:  THE "NEW YORK 
TIMES" REPORTED YESTERDAY THAT 
THE PRESIDENT HAD ENGAGED IN 
OUTRIGHT TAX FRAUD THROUGHOUT 
THE '90s WITH SUSPECT TAX 
SCHEMES AND BASICALLY GETTING 
MORE MONEY FROM HIS PARENTS 
THAN HE SAID IN THOUSANDS OF 
DOCUMENTS. 
HE REBUTTED THE STORY. 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT'S 
INACCURATE ABOUT THAT STORY IF 
THERE IS ACTUALLY ANYTHING 
THAT'S INACCURATE ABOUT IT? 
>> IT'S A TOTALLY FALSE ATTACK 
BASED ON AN OLD RECYCLED NEWS 
STORY. 
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT AND GO 
THROUGH EVERY LINE OF A 14,000-
WORD STORY. 
THE ONLY THING -- I WILL SAY 
ONE THING THE ARTICLE DID GET 
RIGHT IS IT SHOWED THAT THE 
PRESIDENT'S FATHER ACTUALLY HAD 
A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE IN 
HIM. 
IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT BROUGHT 
HIS FATHER INTO A LOT OF DEALS 
AND THEY MADE A LOT OF MONEY 
TOGETHER, SO MUCH SO, THAT HIS 
FATHER WENT ON TO SAY THAT 
EVERYTHING HE TOUCHED TURNED TO 
GOLD. 
THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER 
ADDRESSED SOME OF THE SPECIFIC 
CLAIMS AND WALKED THROUGH HOW 
THE ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD AND 
TAX EVASION ARE 100% FALSE AND 
HIGHLY DEFAMATORY. 
THERE WAS NO FRAUD OR TAX 
EVASION BY ANYONE. 
HE WENT ON MUCH FURTHER, AND I 
WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ 
EVERY WORD OF HIS STATEMENT 
WHICH COMPLETELY UNDERCUTS THE 
ACCUSATIONS MADE BY THE "NEW 
YORK TIMES." 
>>REPORTER:  THE PRESIDENT'S 
TAXES STILL UNDER AUDIT? 
>> I KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF HIS 
TAXES ARE STILL UNDER AUDIT. 
>>REPORTER:  FROM THE '90s AND 
THE 2000s? 
>> I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO 
YOU. 
>>REPORTER:  IS HE RELEASING 
ANY OF HIS TAX RETURNS? 
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY. 
>>REPORTER:  IT WAS JUST A WEEK 
AGO THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD A VERY 
CREDIBLE WITNESS, VERY 
CREDIBLE, VERY COMPELLING. 
NOW HE'S BASICALLY MAKING HER 
OUT TO BE A LIAR, SO WHICH IS 
IT? 
>> CERTAINLY THE TESTIMONY BY 
DR. FORD WAS COMPELLING, BUT 
YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS DECISION 
BASED ON EMOTION. 
IT HAS TO BE BASED ON FACT. 
THEY HAVE TO DETERMINE WHAT THE 
FACTS ARE OF THIS CASE. 
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT 
THEY ASKED AND BEGGED FOR THE 
F.B.I. 
AND DELAYED A HEARING VOTE IS 
SO THEY COULD GET MORE FACTS ON 
THIS CASE. 
WE EXPECT THE F.B.I. 
TO TURN THOSE FACTS OVER TO THE 
SENATE AND THEY CAN MAKE A 
DETERMINATION BASED ON THAT. 
THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR. 
>>REPORTER:  YOU SAID THAT HE 
WAS STATING THE FACTS OF AT 
THAT CAMPAIGN RALLY, BUT THIS 
WAS SO MUCH MORE THAN STATING 
THE FACTS. 
THIS WAS A FULL-SCALE CAMPAIGN 
RALLY ASSAULT ON A WOMAN WHO 
SAYS SHE'S THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL 
ASSAULT. 
WHAT DO YOU GET OUT OF THAT? 
IS THAT TO HELP KAVANAUGH'S 
NOMINATION? 
IS THIS TO RALLY THE BASE? 
IS THIS GOING TO HELP WITH THE 
MIDTERMS? 
LIKE WHAT'S THE POINT IN DOING 
THAT? 
>> AGAIN, I DISPUTE THAT IT 
WASN'T ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE 
PRESIDENT STATING FACTS. 
IN FACT, FACTS THAT WERE LAID 
OUT IN THE PROSECUTOR'S MEMO 
THAT SHE PUT FORWARD TO THE 
SENATE. 
EACH OF THE THINGS THAT HE 
CALLED OUT WERE THINGS THAT 
WERE LAID OUT IN THAT MEMO. 
>>REPORTER:  THANKS, SARAH. 
THERE IS CONFLICTING FEELINGS 
ON CAPITOL HILL RIGHT NOW OVER 
WHETHER THE F.B.I. 
INVESTIGATION INTO JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE MADE PUBLIC 
OR NOT. 
DOES THE WHITE HOUSE COMMIT TO 
TRANSPARENCY ON THIS EFFORT AND 
LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SEE THE 
FULL REIGN OF THIS 
INVESTIGATION REGARDLESS OF THE 
FINDINGS? 
>> LOOK, WE'VE BEEN VERY OPEN 
AND TRANSPARENT THROUGH THE 
PROCESS. 
THE PRESIDENT IS THE ONE THAT 
ORDERED THE F.B.I. 
INVESTIGATION TO TAKE PLACE AND 
HAS ALLOWED THE SENATE TO 
ACTUALLY CONTROL AND DICTATE 
THE TERMS AND SCOPE OF THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO THAT AND 
ALLOWING THE F.B.I. 
TO ACTUALLY DO IT AS THEY DO 
BEST, AND THAT'S THEIR JOBS TO 
DO THIS INVESTIGATION. 
>>REPORTER:  ANOTHER QUESTION 
FOR YOU, IF I MAY, ON 
DECLASSIFICATION SINCE WE 
HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN A WHILE. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID -- 
>> YOU GUYS TOO. 
>>REPORTER:  THE PRESIDENT SAID 
THAT HE WOULD REFER THE 
DECLASSIFICATION PROCESS TO THE 
D.O.J. 
INSPECTOR GENERAL, BUT HE WANTS 
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN QUICKLY. 
WHAT DOES QUICKLY MEAN? 
ARE WE GOING TO SEE THESE 
DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS? 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO WALK 
THROUGH A TIMELINE, BUT WE'RE 
CONTINUING TO WORK THROUGH THAT 
PROCESS, AND WHEN WE HAVE AN 
UPDATE ON IT, WE'LL CERTAINLY 
LET YOU KNOW. 
ALEX. 
>>REPORTER:  WHY DID YOU SAY 
EARLIER THIS YEAR MICHAEL COHEN 
WAS -- THIS YEAR THAT MICHAEL 
COHEN WAS ACTING ON HIS OWN IN 
AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING TO 
KEEP STORMY DANIELS FROM DOING 
A TELEVISION INTERVIEW WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT ACTUALLY DIRECTED 
THAT MOVE? 
>> AS YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOING 
TO GET INTO A BACK AND FORTH. 
THAT'S AN ISSUE FOR THE 
PRESIDENT'S OUTSIDE COUNSEL. 
I DIRECT YOU THERE TO ANSWER 
IT. 
JOHN. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, SARAH. 
FIRST, THE IMPACT AND MEANING 
OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS IN 
MISSISSIPPI NOTWITHSTANDING, IT 
IS A FACT THAT SENATORS CLINZ, 
MURKOWSKI, -- COLLINS, FLAKE, 
MURKOWSKI AND MANCHIN, THE 
VOTES CRITICAL TO THE 
NOMINATION, ARE THERE ANY PLANS 
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO CALL ANY 
OF THEM BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT 
WEEK AND MAKE ONE FINAL PITCH, 
PERHAPS EXPLAIN HIS REMARKS A 
LITTLE BIT MORE? 
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF A SPECIFIC 
SCHEDULED CALL, BUT WE 
CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE 
CONTACT WITH A NUMBER OF 
MEMBERS AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO 
DO SO UP UNTIL THE VOTE. 
BLAKE. 
SORRY. 
GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  I WAS GOING TO ASK 
WAS TWO OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
EARLY SUPPORTERS IN THE HOUSE 
COLLINS OF NEW YORK AND DUNCAN 
HUNTER OF CALIFORNIA ARE 
RUNNING UNDER INDICTMENT. 
THERE ARE RULES OF THE NATIONAL 
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL 
COMMITTEE BARRING SUPPORT FOR 
MEMBERS WHO ARE UNDER 
INDICTMENT. 
DOES THE PRESIDENT STILL 
SUPPORT BOTH OF THEM FOR RE-
ELECTION? 
>> I CAN'T GET INTO A LOT OF 
DETAILS, ONE, FOR HATCH ACT 
VIOLATION, BUT ALSO WITH AN 
ONGOING INVESTIGATION I'M NOT 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON 
THAT HERE. 
>>REPORTER:  YES, SARAH, THANK 
YOU. 
AS THIS BRIEFING WAS BEGINNING, 
BLOOMBERG PUT OUT AN ARTICLE 
ABOUT THE F.B.I. 
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION AND 
BLOOMBERG IS REPORTING RIGHT 
NOW THA THE F.B.I. 
HAS AN -- HASN'T INTERVIEWED 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH OR DR. FORD 
BECAUSE THE WHITE HOUSE HASN'T 
GIVEN INVESTIGATORS CLEAR 
AUTHORITY TO DO SO. 
IS THAT INDEED THE CASE? 
>> AS WE'VE SAID SEVERAL TIMES, 
THE PRESIDENT HAS INDICATED 
THAT WHOEVER THE F.B.I. 
DEEMS NECESSARY TO INTERVIEW 
HE'S FINE WITH THAT, BUT HE'S 
ALSO ASKED THAT THE SENATE BE 
THE ONES THAT DETERMINE THE 
SCOPE OF WHAT THEY NEED IN 
ORDER TO MAKE A DECISION ON 
WHETHER THEY VOTE KAVANAUGH UP 
OR DOWN. 
I CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT BOTH 
KAVANAUGH, JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 
DR. FORD WERE QUESTIONED IN THE 
MOST PUBLIC WAY POSSIBLE BY THE 
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE WHO WERE 
ULTIMATELY THE ONES WHO HAVE TO 
MAKE THE DETERMINATION ON 
WHETHER OR NOT THEY VOTE FOR 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
IF THEY HAD ADDITIONAL 
QUESTIONS FOR EITHER ONE OF 
THEM, THEY HAD A TIME AND AN 
OPPORTUNITY CERTAINLY TO ASK 
THOSE. 
>>REPORTER:  DOES THE WHOIS 
BELIEVE IT IS APPROPRIATE THEN? 
DOES THE WHITE HOUSE BELIEVE IT 
IS APPROPRIATE FOR THESE TWO -- 
>> WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW THE 
F.B.I. 
TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION OF 
THE SCOPE. 
>>REPORTER:  IESHA, GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKED 
YESTERDAY A LOT ABOUT THIS 
ISSUE OF BEING CONCERNED ABOUT 
MEN BEING GUILTY BEFORE -- 
BEING FOUND GUILTY BEFORE 
PROVEN INNOCENT AND THIS IDEA 
OF DUE PROCESS. 
BUT IN THE PAST WELFARE THE 
CENTRAL PARK FIVE, HE PUT OUT 
AN AD BASICALLY CALLING FOR THE 
DEATH PENALTY BEFORE THEY HAD 
BEEN FOUND CONVICTED AND EVEN 
AFTER THEY WERE EXONERATED, HE 
STILL BASICALLY SAID THAT THEY 
MAY BE GUILTY, AND EVEN AS 
PRESIDENT HE HAS TALKED ABOUT 
-- PRESIDED OVER RALLIES WHERE 
PEOPLE SAY LOCK HER UP TALKING 
ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. 
SO I GUESS IS THERE A 
DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT IS INTERESTED IN DUE 
PROCESS FOR SOME BUT NOT FOR 
OTHERS? 
>> NOT AT ALL. 
THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY 
ENCOURAGED THE SENATE TO HEAR 
DR. FORD'S SENATE IN THE SAME 
WAY HE ENCOURAGED THEM TO HEAR 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S. 
HE IS SIMPLY STATING THE FACT 
THAT WE ARE A COUNTRY OF LAW 
AND ORDER, WE ARE A COUNTRY 
THAT STILL BELIEVES THAT YOU'RE 
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY, 
AND WE WANT TO SEE THAT PROCESS 
GO THROUGH IN ITS ENTIRETY AND 
IT SHOULD BE ON A FAIR PLAYING 
FIELD. 
THAT'S SIMPLY THE ONLY CLAIM 
HE'S MAKING. 
>>REPORTER:  THE CRIME IS 
GUILTY, DOES HE FEEL THAT NOW? 
>> I'D HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT THE 
SPECIFIC COMMENTS. 
DAVE. 
>>REPORTER:  THAT'S A REAL 
QUESTION IN THE MIDST OF THIS. 
>> I'M SORRY. 
DAVID, GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  THE PRESIDENT HAS 
TAKEN THIS MOMENT TO SAY HE'S 
BEEN AFFECTED PERSONALLY BY ALL 
OF THESE ALLEGATIONS, AND HE'S 
PICKING AND CHOOSING JUST AS 
THE QUESTION WAS. 
HE SAID THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE 
WAS GUILTY, AND THEN HE HAS 
MADE BILL CLINTON GUILTY. 
HAS HE DECIDED TO CHANGE HIS 
MIND ON THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE 
AS THEY HAVE BEEN EXONERATED? 
>> IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU 
BRING UP BILL CLINTON. 
NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR THOSE 
ACCUSERS' VOICES BE HEARD, BUT 
YOU'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO HEAR 
ALL THE OTHERS. 
DAVID, GO AHEAD. 
I'VE ADDRESSED THIS. 
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO 
ADD. 
>>REPORTER:  IS HE STILL 
TALKING TO THEM? 
>>REPORTER:  SARAH, SEVERAL 
TIMES IN THE LAST WEEK THE 
PRESIDENT HAS TRIED TO REASSURE 
VOTERS THAT PROTECT PEOPLE WITH 
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS FROM 
LOSING THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE. 
DOES THAT -- IS THAT A SIGN 
HE'S WORRIED THAT REPUBLICANS 
ARE LOSING THE ARGUMENT ON 
HEALTHCARE IN THIS ELECTION? 
>> I THINK IT'S A SIGN THAT 
PEOPLE WANTS TO PROTECT PEOPLE 
WITH PRE-EXISTING HEALTH 
CONDITIONS. 
I THINK IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. 
HE SAID HE SUPPORTS THAT AND HE 
WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S 
NOT SOMETHING THAT GETS LOST. 
JIM. 
>>REPORTER:  WE GO BACK TO THIS 
-- I MEAN, IT WAS PRETTY 
OBVIOUS THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 
MOCKING CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD 
LAST NIGHT. 
HE SAID HOW DID YOU GET HOME? 
I DON'T REMEMBER. 
HOW DID YOU GET THERE? 
I DON'T REMEMBER. 
WHERE IS THIS PLACE? 
I DON'T REMEMBER. 
HE SEEMED TO BE TO THE DELIGHT 
OF THE CROWD THERE IN 
MISSISSIPPI MOCKING HER 
REPEATEDLY. 
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING WRONG 
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES MOCKING SOMEBODY 
WHO SAYS SHE WAS SEXUALLY 
ASSAULTED? 
>> IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE WAS 
STATING FACTS  THAT DR. FORD 
HERSELF LAID OUT IN HER 
TESTIMONY. 
ONCE AGAIN, EVERY SINGLE WORD 
THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS SAID 
HAS BEEN LOOKED AT, EXAMINED, 
PICKED APART BY MOST OF YOU IN 
THIS ROOM, BUT NO ONE IS 
LOOKING AT WHETHER OR NOT THE 
ACCUSATIONS MADE ARE 
CORROBORATED, WHETHER OR NOT 
THERE'S EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT 
THEM. 
EVERY PERSON THAT SHE NAMED HAS 
COME OUT AND SAID EITHER THEY 
DIDN'T RECALL IT OR IT DIDN'T 
HAPPEN OR THEY WEREN'T THERE. 
EVERY SINGLE BIT OF EVIDENCE 
AND FACTS  THAT WE'VE SEEN IN 
THIS MOMENT HAVE SUPPORTED 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S CASE, AND THE 
PRESIDENT SIMPLY POINTING OUT 
THE FACTS OF THE MATTER AND 
THAT'S WHAT THE SENATE WILL 
HAVE TO USE TO DETERMINE 
WHETHER OR NOT THEY SUPPORT HIM 
OR NOT. 
>>REPORTER:  ARE YOU SAYING 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS THE VICTIM 
IN ALL THIS? 
>> I THINK BOTH DR. FORD AND 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH ARE VICTIMS AT 
THE HANDS OF THE DEMOCRATS. 
I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY 
DISGRACEFUL WHAT THEY'VE DONE 
AND EXPLOITED THIS PROCESS. 
THEY EXPLOITED DR. FORD, 
THEY'RE EXPLOITING ALL OF THE 
WOMEN THAT HAVE COME OUT TO 
MAKE ANY TYPE OF ACCUSATION. 
THIS ISN'T THE PROCESS THAT 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE, AND 
CERTAINLY EVERYBODY DESERVES TO 
BE HEARD, BUT THAT INCLUDES 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, AND THAT 
SHOULD BE PART OF THIS PROCESS, 
AND THE FACTS HAVE TO BE LOOKED 
AT AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK 
AT THE PROSECUTOR'S MEMO. 
THOSE ARE WHERE YOU SEE ALL OF 
THOSE FACTS LAID OUT AND I 
THINK SHE MAKES A VERY 
COMPELLING CASE. 
JOHN, GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  YOU DON'T HAVE ANY 
PROBLEM DEFENDING -- 
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM 
STATING FACTS, NO. 
JOHN. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, SARAH. 
>> I KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY 
SOMETHING YOU DO HAVE A PROBLEM 
WITH, BUT I DON'T. 
>>REPORTER:  ACTUALLY, SARAH, 
WE DO STATE THE FACTS. 
I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN MANY 
OCCASIONS WHERE YOU DON'T STATE 
THE FACTS, IF I MAY RESPOND. 
>> JOHN, GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, SARAH. 
JUST FIVE DAYS AGO ON FRIDAY 
THE PRESIDENT WHEN ASKED ABOUT 
DR. FORD'S TESTIMONY BEFORE THE 
SENATE SAID THAT SHE WAS A VERY 
CREDIBLE WITNESS AND WE SAW A 
DIFFERENT TONE, A DIFFERENT 
SUBSTANCE LAST NIGHT IN THOSE 
REMARKS TO THAT CAMPAIGN RALLY 
AUDIENCE IN MISSISSIPPI. 
WHY THE CHANGE IN TONE? 
AND DOES THE PRESIDENT STILL 
BELIEVE WHAT HE SAID ON FRIDAY 
THAT SHE WAS A VERY CREDIBLE 
WITNESS? 
>> I'VE ADDRESSED THIS A NUMBER 
OF TIMES. 
THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAID SHE HAD 
A VERY COMPELLING STORY. 
AND NOBODY DISAGREES WITH THAT. 
HOLD ON. 
>>REPORTER:  CREDIBLE -- 
>> NOBODY DISAGREES WITH THAT. 
BUT THE PRESIDENT IS SIMPLY 
STATING THE FACTS THAT SHE LAID 
OUT IN HER OWN TESTIMONY AND 
THAT THE PROSECUTOR LAID OUT IN 
HER MEMO. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE 
SENATE HAS TO MAKE A DECISION 
ON WHERE THEY STAND. 
TAKE ONE MORE. 
>>REPORTER:  DOES HE STILL -- 
DOES THE PRESIDENT STILL 
BELIEVE THAT DR. FORD'S 
TESTIMONY WAS CREDIBLE WHEN SHE 
TESTIFIED UNDER OATH? 
>> THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE 
CONFIRMED. 
HE HAS A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN 
HIM AND HE'D LIKE TO SEE A VOTE 
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. 
>>REPORTER:  JUST A COUPLE 
QUESTIONS. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SEEMED TO 
LINK THE CREDIBILITY OF A CLAIM 
WITH HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED 
SINCE THE INDIVIDUAL MADE IT. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALSO CALLED 
THE SEX ABUSE SCANDAL IN THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH VERY SAD, BUT 
MANY OF THOSE VICTIMS WAITED 
DECADES BEFORE COMING FORWARD. 
WHY DOES THE PRESIDENT SEEM TO 
ASSUME MEN WHO ARE CLAIMING 
ABUSE BUT WAIT TO COME FORWARD 
ARE TELLING THE TRUTH BUT NOT 
WOMEN? 
>> THAT'S JUST COMPLETELY 
UNTRUE. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS SUPPORTED, 
AGAIN, THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE 
PROCESS DR. FORD'S ABILITY TO 
COME FORWARD AND TELL HER 
STORY. 
HE'S THE ONE THAT ORDERED THE 
F.B.I. 
TO DO A BACKGROUND -- FURTHER 
SUPPLEMENTAL BACKGROUND CHECK 
TO LOOK INTO EACH OF THE 
ACCUSATIONS AND ALLEGATIONS 
THAT THE SENATE DEEMS NECESSARY 
 
HE'S ALSO BEEN MORE THAN HAPPY 
TO GIVE A PLATFORM TO THE 
ACCUSERS THAT HAVE COME OUT 
AGAINST THEN PRESIDENT BILL 
CLINTON. 
TO SAY THAT HE'S NEVER SIDED 
WITH WOMEN IS JUST RIDICULOUS. 
>>REPORTER:  HE HAS IMPLIED 
THAT THEY'RE COMING OUT OF THE 
WOODWORK ALL OF A SUDDEN AND 
CITED THAT AS A REASON WHY -- 
EVEN THOUGH HE HAS CALLED FOR 
AN INVESTIGATION -- 
>> HE'S SAYING THAT BECAUSE 
AFTER JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN 
IN PUBLIC SERVICE AND IN THE 
PUBLIC EYE FOR OVER 26 YEARS, 
BEEN THROUGH SIX BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATIONS, NOW PART OF A 
SEVENTH THAT THIS IS THE FIRST 
TIME THAT YOU'RE EVER HEARING 
OF ANY OF THESE ALLEGATIONS, 
THE FACT THAT THROUGH ALL OF 
THOSE BACKGROUND CHECKS, NOT 
EVEN AN INKLING OF ANY OF THOSE 
THINGS HAS EVER COME UP, 
DESPITE THE FACT HE WAS ONE OF 
THE TOP PROSECUTORS FOR KEN 
STARR AND IN A MAJOR PUBLIC 
POSITION, NONE OF THESE THINGS 
CAME UP. 
WHEN HE WAS NOMINATED TO BE ON 
THE FEDERAL BENCH, NONE OF 
THESE THINGS CAME UP. 
HE HAS BEEN A PUBLIC FIGURE AND 
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF 
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO RAISE 
THIS ISSUE AND IT NEVER HAS. 
AND NOW AT THE 11th HOUR THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE EXPLOITED THIS 
PROCESS AND DONE SO PUBLICLY 
AND IT'S A SHAME, AND HE'S 
SIMPLY CALLING THAT OUT. 
THANKS SO MUCH, GUYS. 
WE'LL SEE YOU SOON. 
>> THE PRESIDENT IS JUST 
STATING THE FACTS. 
THAT COMES FROM SARAH HUCKABEE 
SANDERS, PRESS SECRETARY THERE 
WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS OVERNIGHT 
REGARDING -- EXCUSE ME, THE 
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS AT A RALLY 
CRITICIZING AND COMING OFF AS 
MOCKING DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD AND HER TESTIMONY. 
WE ALSO HEARD FROM AMBASSADOR 
BOLTON WHO SPOKE ABOUT NORTH 
KOREA AND IRAN AND ALSO THE 
PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI CONFLICT AS 
WELL. 
WE'LL GET TO ERROL BARNETT WITH 
THAT. 
BUT A LOT OF THIS FOCUSED ON 
KAVANAUGH AND EXACTLY WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY WHEN HE 
DID MOCK DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD IN THAT RALLY YESTERDAY. 
AND WE HEARD FROM SARAH 
HUCKABEE SANDERS SAYING THAT 
SHE WAS -- HE WAS JUST STATING 
THE FACTS, POINTING OUT 
DISCREPANCIES IN HER STORY AND 
STATING THE FACTS. 
THAT WAS SORT OF THE BOTTOM 
LINE THAT SHE HAD TO SAY. 
DOES THIS JEOPARDIZE REPUBLICAN 
VOTES? 
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS SAID I 
DON'T THINK SO. 
WHEN WE HEARD FROM BOLTON, HE 
ALSO TALKED ABOUT NORTH KOREA, 
HE WAS ASKED POINT BLANK BY A 
REPORTER IF HE TRUSTS KIM JONG-
UN AS MUCH AS THE PRESIDENT 
DOES, AND HE DODGED THAT 
QUESTION AND CHOSE NOT TO 
ANSWER IT. 
BUT WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT 
KAVANAUGH, JUDGE KAVANAUGH WITH 
CBS NEWS WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT WEIJIA JIANG WHO 
WAS AT THE BRIEFING. 
WEIJIA, WE WERE JUST TALKING 
ABOUT HOW SHE WAS ASKED -- 
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS WAS 
ASKED IF THIS WOULD JEOPARDIZE 
VOTES? 
I DON'T THINK SO WAS HER 
RESPONSE. 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE 
HEARD TODAY? 
>>REPORTER:  WELL, YOU KNOW, 
REENA, WHAT ELSE WAS SHE GOING 
TO SAY IN THIS IS A VERY TOUGH 
POSITION HAVING TO DEFEND 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AFTER HE WENT 
THERE LAST NIGHT. 
AND EVEN THOUGH SARAH SANDERS 
AND OTHER ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS INSIST THAT HE WAS 
NOT MOCKING DR. FORD, THAT 
CERTAINLY WAS THE TONE THAT 
MANY PEOPLE ARE PERCEIVING THIS 
TO BE, INCLUDING THOSE CRITICAL 
REPUBLICANS WHO WILL 
ESSENTIALLY DECIDE WHETHER 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS CONFIRMED. 
AS WE KNOW SENATORS COLLINS AND 
FLAKE WHO ARE ON THE FENCE CAME 
OUT THIS MORNING AND, YOU KNOW, 
CALLED WHAT HE SAID IN HIS TONE 
APPALLING. 
AND SO THE BIG QUESTION FOR 
SARAH SANDERS TODAY WAS IS IT 
WORTH IT? 
IS IT WORTH USING THAT SORT OF 
RHETORIC TO TALK ABOUT DR. 
FORD, AND SHE MAINTAINED THAT 
HE WAS SIMPLY POINTING OUT THE 
FACTS, POINTING OUT 
INCONSISTENCIES IN HER STORY 
BASED ON WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE 
SAID AS WELL SO FAR IN THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
BUT POINTING OUT DISCREPANCYIES 
AND WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE 
PRESIDENT ARE TWO VERY 
DIFFERENT THINGS, RIGHT? 
AND SO SHE DIDN'T GIVE AN 
ALTERNATIVE TO THE CLAIMS THAT 
HE WAS MOCKING HER, BUT SHE WAS 
VERY FIRM THAT HE WASN'T 
MOCKING HER, THAT HE WAS SIMPLY 
TRYING TO POINT OUT THE FACTS. 
BUT TO YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION, 
REENA, I THINK, YOU KNOW, THIS 
IS THE LINE OF DEFENSE RIGHT 
NOW. 
YOU KNOW, WE TALK TO SOURCES 
THIS MORNING AS WELL WHO SAY 
THE SAME THING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING 
WRONG BECAUSE HE JUST WANTS TO 
PRESENT THE MOST ACCURATE 
VERSION OF THIS STORY, WELL, 
THEN WHY NOT WAIT? 
WHY NOT WAIT FOR THE F.B.I. 
úTO 
PRESENT WHAT IT FOUND BEFORE 
DECIDING ON HIS OWN? 
OF COURSE THE PRESIDENT HAS 
SEEMED TO DECIDE ON HIS OWN 
SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING HERE 
ABOUT WHETHER HE BELIEVES DR. 
FORD, EVEN THOUGH HE SAYS THE 
F.B.I. 
OUGHT TO INVESTIGATE AND THAT 
HE WANTS TO HEAR HER TESTIMONY, 
ON THE OTHER HAND MANY TIMES HE 
HAS SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, IT IS 
HER BURDEN TO PROVE THAT. 
AND SO -- 
>> SORRY. 
BOTTOM LINE THE SENSE FROM THE 
WHITE HOUSE, IS IT OPTIMISM 
THAT THIS NOMINATION WILL 
ULTIMATELY GO THROUGH WHEN IT 
GOES DOWN FOR A VOTE? 
>>REPORTER:  YES, ABSOLUTELY. 
THEY BELIEVE THAT DESPITE THESE 
HANDFUL OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS 
 
BELIEVE THAT HE WILL IN FACT BE 
CONFIRMED. 
AT LEAST THAT'S THEIR MESSAGE, 
BUT CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, THERE 
IS A CONCERN HERE BECAUSE, 
AGAIN, THE WHOLE REASON WHY THE 
SENATE HAS NOT VOTED ALREADY IS 
BECAUSE OF THIS UNCERTAINTY AND 
THIS UNCERTAINTY WILL NOT BE 
RESOLVED UNTIL THEY HEAR FROM 
THE F.B.I. 
SO I THINK THEY ARE GETTING 
AHEAD OF THEMSELVES IN ASSUMING 
THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE JUST 
FINE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THOSE 
SENATORS WOULD HAVE AGREED TO 
VOTE ALREADY, BUT THEY ARE 
STANDING FIRM AND THEY WANT TO 
HEAR WHATEVER THE F.B.I. 
FINDS AND DESPITE THE OPTIMISM 
HERE THAT IS BEING PRESENTED, I 
DO THINK THAT THERE'S AN 
UNDERCURRENT OF CONCERN, 
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT, 
YOU KNOW, THOSE KEY REPUBLICANS 
REACTED IN THAT WAY TO WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID LAST NIGHT 
AT THAT RALLY. 
>> INTERESTING TO SEE WHETHER 
OR NOT THEY WILL FALL IN LINE 
AND VOTE WITH THE PRESIDENT AS 
WELL. 
WEIJIA, I WANT TO THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR JOINING US. 
>>REPORTER:  THANKS, REENA. 
>>>  WELL, AS WE HEARD EARLIER, 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JOHN 
BOLTON REFERRED TO THE UNITED 
NATIONS INTERNATIONAL COURT OF 
JUSTICE THAT RULED THIS MORNING 
THAT THE UNITED STATES MUST 
EASE SANCTIONS ON IRAN. 
WELL, HERE'S WHAT SECRETARY OF 
STATE MIKE POMPEO HAD TO SAY 
ABOUT THE COURT'SDECISION. 
>> I'M ANNOUNCING THAT THE 
UNITED STATES IS TERMINATING 
THE 1955 TREATY OF AMITY WITH 
IRAN. 
THIS IS A DECISION, FRANKLY 
THAT IS 39 YEARS OVERDUE. 
>> THE DECADES-OLD TREATY DEALT 
WITH ECONOMIC AND CONSULAR TIES 
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND IRAN. 
CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT ERROL 
BARNETT WAS AT SECRETARY 
POMPEO'S BRIEFING AND HE JOINS 
US NOW FROM WASHINGTON. 
SO, ERROL, WHAT WAS THE REASON 
THAT POMPEO GAVE FROM PULLING 
OUT OF THIS TREATY AND WHAT DO 
YOU THINK IT MEANS WHEN IT 
ULTIMATELY COMES DOWN TO 
U.S./IRANIAN RELATIONS? 
>>REPORTER:  WELL, THE BOTTOM 
LINE HERE IS THAT DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED 
STATES AND IRAN ARE BAD AND 
THEY'RE GETTING WORSE. 
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO 
PULLING OUT OF THIS TREATY 
WHICH EFFECTIVELY ESTABLISHES 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AND, YOU 
KNOW, BENEFICIAL ECONOMIC TRADE 
BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS AT A 
TIME WHEN SANCTIONS ARE ABOUT 
TO HIT ON IRAN ON NOVEMBER 4th 
BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
DECISION TO PULL OUT OF THE 
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. 
THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER 
JOHN BOLTON AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
THIS AFTERNOON REITERATING THE 
SECRETARY'S POINTS AND 
EFFECTIVELY SAYING THAT, LOOK, 
ALL OF THESE MULTI-NATIONAL 
BODIES, NOT JUST AT THE U.N. 
BUT ELSEWERE ARE BIASED, 
INEFFECTIVE AND HAVE NO REAL 
JURISDICTION WHEN IT COMES TO 
THE UNITED STATES DOMESTIC AND 
FOREIGN POLICY. 
THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER 
JOHN BOLTON ALSO SAYING THAT 
THE U.S. IS PULLING OUT OF THE 
VIENNA CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS BECAUSE PALESTINIANS 
BROUGHT A COMPLAINT TO THAT 
ENTITY BECAUSE THE U.S. MOVED 
ITS JERUSALEM AND ISRAEL FROM 
TEL AVIV TO JERUSALEM. 
SO THIS IS A FEW HITBACKS FROM 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN THE 
WAKE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S U.N. 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY SPEECH WHICH 
WAS ABOUT SOVEREIGNTY AND THE 
LIMITS OF MULTI-NATIONAL BODIES 
AND THE U.S. IS SHOWING THAT IT 
DOES NOT FIND A LOT OF THESE 
ENTITIES TO BE EFFECTIVE, TO BE 
LEGITIMATE, AND IT IS NOW 
PULLING OUT OF THEM. 
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO 
SAYING THE RELATIONSHIP WITH 
IRAN IS NOT POSITIVE AND 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER 
BOLTON SAYING THE SAME THING, 
BUT THEIR BEEF IS WITH THE 
AYATOLLAHS, WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT, WITH THE 
LEADERSHIP. 
THEY BOTH MADE POINTS TODAY TO 
SAY IT IS NOT WITH THE IRANIAN 
PEOPLE. 
>> YOU KNOW, POMPEO WE KNOW, 
ERROL, IS ALSO TRAVELING TO 
NORTH KOREA LATER THIS WEEK. 
WHAT DID HE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT 
THAT UPCOMING VISIT? 
>> THAT'S RIGHT.  
BE HEADING TO JAPAN, NORTH 
KOREA, SOUTH KOREA AND CHINA AS 
HE TRIES TO PULL TOGETHER U.S. 
ALLIES IN THE REGION TO MAKE 
PROGRESS TOWARD THIS TRACK FOR 
A FULL VERIFIABLE AND 
IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION 
OF THE NORTH KOREAN PENINSULA. 
BUT HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW. 
THE DEADLINE FOR THIS LOFTY 
GOAL IS THE END OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S FIRST TERM IN JANUARY 
2021. 
AND WE KNOW THAT NORTH KOREA IN 
THE SHORT TERM WANTS THE U.S. 
TO OFFICIALLY DECLARE AN END TO 
THE KOREAN WAR BY THE END OF 
THIS YEAR. 
THERE'S NO SIGNS YET FROM THE 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THAT WILL 
HAPPEN. 
WE KNOW THAT THE U.S. WANTS A 
FULL I10ARY FROM NORTH KOREA. 
-- ITINERARY FROM NORTH KOREA. 
WHAT KIND OF NUCLEAR ASSETS DO 
YOU HAVE, WHERE ARE THEY IN THE 
COUNTRY, SO THEN THEY CAN 
EFFECTIVELY MEASURE HOW CLOSE 
KOREA IS GETTING TO 
DENUCLEARIZE OR OPEN UP THESE 
SITES FOR INTERNATIONAL 
INSPECTORS AND THAT HAS YET TO 
HAPPEN. 
SO SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO AT 
THIS STAGE IS PAINTING DIALOGUE 
AS SUCCESS, THE FACT THAT THE 
U.S. AND NORTH KOREA'S TOP 
DIPLOMAT, POMPEO AND HIS 
COUNTERPART SPOKE TO EACH OTHER 
AT THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY, 
HE SAYS THAT'S PROGRESS. 
THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLING KIM 
JONG-UN ROCKET MAN ANY MORE, HE 
SAYS THAT IS PROGRESS, AND HE 
HOPES IT WILL RESULT IN 
SOMETHING TANGIBLE SOON. 
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE, YOU 
KNOW, WHAT THAT IS UNTIL AFTER 
HE DOES HIS ASIAN TOUR THIS 
WEEKEND. 
>> IT'S INTERESTING, THOUGH, 
THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON STOPPED SHY 
OF ACTUALLY DIRECTLY SAYING 
THAT HE TRUSTS KIM JONG-UN. 
WHAT'S THE MOOD, ERROL, IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE, DO THEY TRUFTZ? 
DO YOU THINK POMPEO TRUSTS KIM 
JONG-UN THE WAY THE PRESIDENT 
DOES? 
>>REPORTER:  WELL, LOOK, IF YOU 
LISTEN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
MOST RECENT COMMENTS AT ONE OF 
HIS RALLIES, HE AND KIM JONG-UN 
FELL IN LOVE AND KIM JONG-UN 
SENT TWO BEAUTIFUL LETTERS TO 
HIM THAT HE SAYS ARE WORKS OF 
ART. 
THAT'S ON THE PRESIDENTIAL 
FRONT. 
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISER JOHN BOLTON 
AND HIS HISTORY, HE HAS BEEN A 
HAWK HERE IN WASHINGTON WHEN IT 
COMES TO CONFRONTING EITHER 
NUCLEAR POWERS OR POTENTIAL 
NUCLEAR POWERS AROUND THE 
WORLD. 
AND SO HIS VIEWS ON IRAN ARE 
QUITE FIRM, AND I THINK THAT'S 
WHAT YOU HEARD HIM DODGE 
ANSWERING THAT QUESTION OF 
TRUSTING KIM JONG-UN BECAUSE 
THAT FAMILY HAS NOT PROVED 
ITSELF TO BE TRUSTWORTHY WITH 
ANY U.S. ADMINISTRATION IN 
DECADES PAST. 
BUT HE'S CERTAINLY SOMEONE TO 
WATCH BECAUSE SINCE BOLTON CAME 
ON BOARD, THE ADMINISTRATION, 
YOU'VE SEEN A MUCH MORE 
AGGRESSIVE POSTURE WHEN IT 
COMES TO THE INTERNATIONAL 
STAGE. 
IT'S SOMETHING TO KIND OF WATCH 
CLOSELY HERE IN THE WEEKS AND 
MONTHS AHEAD AS THE U.S. DEALS 
WITH TWO, YOU KNOW, ALMOST 
NUCLEAR POWERS WITH IRAN AND 
NORTH KOREA AND WHAT TO DO 
ABOUT THEM. 
>> WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE 
EXACTLY HOW THIS GOES DOWN. 
ERROL BARNETT, GRATEFUL YOU 
COULD JOIN US, ERROL. 
>>REPORTER:  OF COURSE. 
>>>  WELL, EVERY AMERICAN WILL 
RECEIVE A NOTIFICATION ON THEIR 
CELL PHONES FROM PRESIDENT 
TRUMP TODAY WHETHER OR NOT YOU 
WANT. 
THE ALERT WILL READ THIS IS A 
TEST OF THE NATIONAL WIRELESS 
EMERGENCY ALERT SOMETHING S. 
FEMA SAYS ALERTS LIKE THIS WILL 
ONLY BE NECESSARY IF WE'RE IN A
