there are two intravenous drug use needle exchange programs coming to Canadian prisons with more in the works now I joke about inmates running the asylum all the time but maybe just maybe they really are Canada's correctional service will be handing out free needles to intravenous drug users inside Canadian prisons starting in June that's right hard time used to mean three square meals and a cod but now it means all of those things plus all the hypodermics you can stick in your arm now phase one of the needle exchange program will begin with one men's institution the Atlantic institution in Rena Snee Brunswick as well as one women's facility the Grand Valley institution in Kitchener Ontario the program will then roll out to other institutions across the country after that now all of this is being done under the auspice of harm-reduction that the poor addicted inmates doing smuggled drugs are having to resort to reusing needles to get their illegal intravenous drug fix inside Canadian big houses now according to Corrections Service Canada HIV rates in prison are 200 times higher than that of the general population and hepatitis C rates are 260 times higher but for both of those diseases though the rates within prisons have decreased considerably in the past ten years now this is insane first off high risk lifestyles can land you in the clink and there's a strong and obvious overlap between high-risk lifestyle choices and infectious disease rates prison doesn't necessarily cause infectious disease rates to go up but the kinds of people who go to prison often live the lifestyles that contribute to someone contracting infectious diseases like homelessness prostitution and yeah drug addiction it's sad but it's true I don't like it but it's reality now what's next giving out knives so inmates don't have to turn their toothbrushes into SHIVs as part of an ongoing commitment to inmate dental health maybe how about toilet bowl winemaking classes or should we just cut out the middleman and give them the wine now now I started looking into where all this madness came from and further to my working theory that all bad ideas somehow come from Ontario this needle exchange idea was born from an Ontario lawsuit in 2012 the lawsuit was brought by the Canadian hiv-aids legal network prisoners with hiv-aids support Action Network which is an aids information group endorsed by Canada's public health agency and the canadian aboriginal aids network which is a coalition of groups that provide support and advocacy for aboriginal people living with aids now that lawsuit claimed it was a violation of the charter rights of prisoners to not have the taxpayer provide them with needles so they could inject their illegal drugs with fresh needles from inside their jail cells the lawsuit claimed it was discrimination to give drug users clean needles outside of jails but not give them inside huh and they tell me not to worry about those slippery slopes now this here information about contraband in Canadian prisons is wild and it was uncovered in a rare act of journalism committed by the CBC in 2014 so you know credit where it's due but just look at this data obtained by CBC News under access to information shows Corrections Service Canada seized eight thousand nine hundred and eighty entre banned items behind bars in 2013 and 2014 up from seven thousand four hundred and fifty eight items two years earlier an increase of twenty percent the number of seizure incidents though dropped by 11 percent to sixty two hundred in 2013 2014 from over 6800 in 2011-2012 okay let's just stop here for a second the prison officials are finding more contraband in fewer seizure events does this mean they are looking less but finding more it seems like it might be effective to look more frequently to stem the flow of increasing contraband like drugs into Canadian prisons but let's go on in this article let's find out what that contraband is and how it's getting into Canadian prisons again from the CV see article the list of contraband seized items include marijuana hash and drug paraphernalia and hard drugs such as crack cocaine crystal meth LSD and ecstasy dangerous weapons were also seized including explosives and incendiary devices hacksaws rope in thousands of weapons handmade by prisoners and 108 televisions were intercepted in that year alone other unauthorized or contraband items seized in federal penitentiaries include alcohol so distilled and brewed alcohol materials for making alcohol and store-bought booze tobacco including cigarettes cigars and loose tobacco communications devices like cell phones cameras cables computer components SIM cards and storage devices other things like government property pornography tattoo guns in paraphernalia money security keys and a grappling hook the items were seized from inmates the public and Corrections staff wait a minute here Corrections staff are doing some of the smuggling that is certainly something the government needs to get a handle on here but now instead of dealing with the criminal elements on the government's payroll the government is helping make life easier to be a drug addict in prison have we forgotten what prison is even for it's punitive of course if you find yourself behind bars it's for punishment but the left keeps telling me prison is about rehabilitation how the heck is the system rehabbing people if Corrections Canada is giving them the tools to break the rules of the prison system and the law while behind bars for another crime look I don't want people to get HIV or the alphabet soup of hepatitis either but that's sort of why I don't want them using drugs or engaging in high-risk lifestyles in the first place and I especially don't want them using drugs while in the care and control of the government this seems like maybe the best time to help people get straight when their every move is supposed to be carefully controlled instead of spending money to help people avoid the rehabilitation part of prisons that's the part the left keeps telling me is so important wouldn't it be more compassionate to the inmate to make sure that prisons are safe for everyone for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read what you just saw there was my daily video that I do here at the rebel but did you know that I have my own weekly
