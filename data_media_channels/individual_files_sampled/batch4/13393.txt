well how many times have you said to yourself I wish this endless campaign would be over so we can finally bring the term of one of the worst presidents in United States history to an end and begin the term of another of the worst presidents in United States history how many times have you said I can't wait until we can finally vote be disgusted with the results start the next endless campaign and so on until my life is thankfully over well congratulations Election Day is here and yes you're also another day closer to death so things are going just the way you want it this is the day when you put to use your ultimate power as a United States citizen the power to drive by a polling place at high speed with your pants down and your backside hanging out the window so whether you're a Hillary Clinton voter or a sentient being it's time for each of you to ask yourself what are the pros and cons of your candidate for Hillary Clinton voters the cons are that your candidate is patently dishonest and greedy that she sold access to her government positions and return for personal wealth and that's her decisions concerning Benghazi Qaddafi and which man she should marry have each led to disaster on the pro side her dental hygiene seems good and her cackling laughter sounds exactly like the crows from the telephone wire scene in Alfred Hitchcock's the birds which turned out to be a much better movie on second viewing than we thought it was at first also Hillary would not only make history as the first woman president her presidency would almost certainly guarantee no woman would ever be elected to that office again so if you're the sort of sexist who doesn't believe there should be a glass ceiling when you can get one made of concrete that's certainly a plus for Donald Trump voters the pros are that by putting an ill educated unprincipled lout in the Oval Office will probably be raising the tone of the presidency from where it is now and since Trump has clearly never read the Constitution he'll only be violating it by accident as opposed to Hillary who would be doing it on purpose also as president Trump rampages through the nation like Godzilla stomping on the lives and reputations of anyone who opposes him there's a strong mathematical probability that we'll get to see him crush some of the people we don't like before he stomps on us most importantly Trump is promised to appoint a Supreme Court justice who will prosecute Hillary for exposing classified information which would be absolutely great if Preem Court justices actually did that sort of thing instead of other Supreme Court etype activities but more seriously if elected Donald Trump will embody the righteous anger of the people and will do their will when it comes to ending free trade and maintaining our system of entitlements so those are the cons trigger warning i'm andrew Clavin and this is the andrew Clavin show come sweet meteor of death from our agony you know i went by my church this morning and there was a line out the door and I thought oh hurray America is coming back to God then I realize it's a polling place and I thought crap yeah people are voting this is a terrible terrible thing so my endorsement is that you run out and buy my memoir the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ is still only $2.99 on ebooks and you're gonna need it because this is the end of the world these are the last days so I did you guys vote that everybody vote so I voted I voted for Trump I was I did it without a qualm but I was sad I will tell you and I know people get angry I see the the comments people leave on Facebook and everything and they're angry at me because I keep saying what a bad guy Trump is and all I can tell you about that is this that this is a marketplace the place where we talk about ideas on radio or on podcasts or in newspaper anywhere it's a marketplace and where the people go that's where the information will be and so if you want people to lie to you you will get lies because it's a marketplace if what you want that's you know the the audience the customer is always right if you want people who lie to you you'll get lies if you want people to tell you that you're righteous that angry self-righteous feeling you have is in fact the truth people will do that that's what they'll do but it won't be me because that's you know I'm here to tell you the way I see it it's the only thing I have to offer you it's the only reason I'm here is to tell you and I'll tell you why you know I'll tell you how I came to the decision because there's still a lot of people including I think Ben is still nevertrump is nice too yeah you still never Trump um hey you know I make fun I have made fun from the very beginning on the fact that Trump voters are angry I'm you know I did that video I'm angry so I'm voting for Trump I think you've got like 16 million it's on Facebook but I'm not making fun of the anger I totally understand why people are angry and I especially understand with this when we have a news media that is so arrogant that it can actually that a network who runs on public air can appoint George Stephanopoulos a Clinton hack to run their news department and think nothing of it and think there's there's no way that anybody can touch them no way that anybody can reach them that they can control information in the entertainment industry that they can ask you to go to a movie where you just want to see people shoot each other and fall in love and I'll do all the things that people do in movies and then insult your beliefs by attacking you know conservative principles you know it makes people angry we're sort of in the position of a guy who has a really really bitchy wife like a wife who just is constantly running him down telling him that he's nothing embarrassing him in public insulting his manhood and finally he hauls off and clauser totally understandable completely in the wrong you know that's that's the way it is if you you don't hold your anger in check then you put yourself in the wrong and that's what I think we have done with Donald Trump and of course you know the political correctness is what drives people crazy Shelby Steele who is one of my favorite political writers one of the very few people I've ever met I can't I can count them one hand the people I've met who have ever overawed me like I couldn't think I shook his hand I couldn't think of anything to say to him because I admired his the clarity of his thought and his beautiful beautiful prose so much I didn't you know I mean I admit I've met all these Hollywood stars I've had lunch with Hollywood Hollywood stars not you know second-tier guys I had lunch with totally top-notch Holly you know it's never really I mean I admire their work and all that and I'm glad to do it but it's it guy like Shelby Steele just knocks me out he wrote a piece today in the Wall Street Journal about political correctness and what is his meant and what it means in terms of Donald Trump I'll read you just a little bit of it but it's worth going and looking at the whole thing he says the current election regardless of its outcome reveals something tragic in the way modern conservatism sits in American life as an ideology and certainly as a political identity conservatism is less popular than the very principles and values it stands for in other words the policy when you say you're a conservative you're less popular then the things you're actually pushing which I found to be true whenever I should speak to left wingers there is a presumption in the culture that heartlessness and bigotry are somehow endemic to conservatism that the rigors of freedom and capitalism literally require exploitation and inequality this despite the fact that so many liberal policies since the 1960's have only worsened the inequalities they sought to overcome and then he goes on to say why is this he says it's because of slavery and past unfairness to minorities and to women that has created the idea that the u.s. is indebted to these people and this is hard the hidden obscured the fact that the u.s. is the most enlightened nation in history he says how do we pay this debt in a word deference since the 1960s when America finally became fully accountable for its past deference toward all groups with any claim to past or present victimization became mandatory deference has become an almost universal marker of simple human decency that asserts when innocence one's innocence of the American past deference has been codified in American life as political correctness and political correctness functions like a despotic regime it is an oppressiveness that spreads its edicts further and further into the crevices of everyday life and he finally says at the end societies like individuals have intuitions Donald Trump is an intuition at least on the level of symbol maybe he would push back against the hegemony of deference if not as a liberator than possibly as a reformer simply he could lift the word responsibility out of its son ambulant stigmatization as a judgmental and bigoted request to make of people in other words it's not bigoted to ask people to take care of themselves this added to a fundamental respect for the capacity of people to lift themselves up could go a long way toward a fairer and better America there's almost an endorsement of Trump he's saying just the fact that he's politically incorrect is worthwhile and there is another thing that I have talked about a lot but you know it's worth mentioning one more time is that the evils of the right and there are evils in capitalism the evil of inequality the evil of people being left behind the evil of people with no recourse when they run out of funds when they run out of luck when their bad behavior catches up with them just because they acted badly doesn't mean we as a society want to sit there and watch them rot and die there are there are problems with freedom problems with capitalism that we set out to that we set out to solve the problems with socialism are invisible the problem with socialism are inherent to social you know steven crowder my pal and a very funny guy that a Praeger video Prager University video where he talked about he talked about how socialism is inherently bad here's here's a little bit of it where he explains the argument unlike capitalism free enterprise which can only occur truly through voluntary transaction socialism can only occur at gunpoint that's what it comes down to if you don't pay your taxes once you get through the IRS and the auditing and the lawyers and the PR stunts people make you give the government your money increasing amount of your money the more successful you are or they send in scary men with guns to take you away now so long as the people having their stuff taken away at gunpoint are in the minority and the majority feels that they'll get to benefit from more said taken stuff you'll always be able to win that decision through a popular vote and claim the moral high ground through democracy putting the word democratic in front of your socialism doesn't make it any inherently more moral nor less violent did you get that American want to be socialists also get a job that's the thing of socialism is force socialism is pure naked force they are taking your money giving it to somebody else because they think they should and by the way the way it works is it's always the middle class who gets stung because what they they take the money from people who look rich to the lower classes but not the real rich George Soros isn't losing any money if to socialism you know it's the guy who makes $250,000 which is a lot of money if you're making twenty thousand dollars you know it seems like a lot of money but it's not really that much money if you're living in LA or New York that's you know kind of a middle-class existence but the point is yeah you're rich to the lower classes but you're not really rich they're really rich never really get taxed under socialism and so eventually what it does is it forces the middle class into poverty and so you have these two tiered system socialism is a two tiered system capitalism if it's worked well is a many tiered system where there are people all up and down the scale so the only question to me is since I believe that Clinton is slightly more of a socialist than Trump although Trump will not reform entitlements the only question was did I have to choose and this is the argument that that Ben and I have been having behind the scenes and Jeremy boring the god-king of The Daily wire and I have been having behind the scenes where is is it truly a binary choice where if you don't choose Trump you are choosing Hillary and I wrestled with this question because I'm a simple guy I look forward it looks to me like I'm a conservative vote if that conservative vote doesn't go to the conservative it's going to the liberal that essentially is giving a vote to the liberal so I think there is sense to that I felt I feel that this country which to which I owe everything I have I have two ways that I love this country I love this country in a high noble way for what it stands for the Republican values the limited government the individual freedom these are the things that I that I love it for at a high level and when it betrays those things or abandons those things I love it less because it no longer represents what I love is the principles and when it doesn't represent those principles I love the country left last but I also love the country the way you love your mother you know you love your mother whether if she drinks whether she's annoying you love her because she bore you because she made you who you are because she raised you this country did all that for me and by the way happened to do it during the 50 greatest years of human history so I was there for the 50 most peaceful most prosperous most fair most just years in all of human history all of human history from its beginning to this moment I lived through and and I'm insanely grateful to America for that and so when it asked me to make a choice even though it's a choice that I find awful I find this to be an awful choice I gotta make it I have to make it if I decide that Hillary and Trump are just as bad then I don't have to make it then I can vote for a third candidate because what difference does it make but it seems to me the Trump is clearly clearly better than Hillary Clinton I believe that after all the panic is over I believe Trump will be a mediocre middle-of-the-road political politically middle-of-the-road president who will do a couple of things that'll make us all cringe we're all go like oh did you really say that and if you know in the office of the presidency you know then he'll be gone he's 70 years old he's not gonna be around forever you know I think he'll be a kind of middle-of-the-road president he'll stumble around but he'll be fine Hillary Clinton is a corrupt lying cheating anti-constitutional bully who has announced that she wants to destroy the first and second amendment she has said that she wants to destroy the first and second amendments when people say that she's not as corrupt as Richard Nixon that her corruption her scandals are not as bad as Watergate I think that's absurd because they're not what they're not factoring in is they're not factoring in the ideological corruption that Barack Obama has already imposed on the IRS on the Justice Department on all the all the organs of government that Obama has corrupted to become purely leftist purely political organs instead of the organs of justice and fairness that they are supposed to be so she'll be walking into this machine and taking it over and adding her own money corruptness which Obama doesn't seem to be money corrupt she'll be adding her own greedy selfish money corruptness to the corrupt system that's already in place you know people say well it's not as bad as Watergate because people were lost their jobs and went to prison over Watergate the fact that people haven't lost their jobs and gone to prison over the IRS scandal is part of the scandal part of the scandal is our press which remember was after Nixon but has turned a blind eye as see no evil is is basically decided to see no evil with the first black president hallelujah so you know to me it seems easy to say the Trump is the better choice and we will talk about this more and look at the closing arguments but first we have to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube so you got to come on over to the Daily wire to hear the sensational rest what's that oh and tonight and come tonight and hear their of course here are fantastic amazing election a drunken election coverage it's gonna be drunken if I have anything to do with it that's for sure
