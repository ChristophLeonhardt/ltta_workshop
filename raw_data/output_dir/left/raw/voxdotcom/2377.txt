1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
3, 2, 1...

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,700
Interstellar space, beyond our solar system, where the Voyagers will drift, endlessly.

3
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:17,100
In 5 billion years, all humans will have become extinct, or evolved into other beings.

4
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,900
None of our artifacts will have survived on Earth,

5
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,500
and the evolution of the sun will have burned the Earth to a crisp.

6
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And far from home, untouched by these remote events,

7
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,700
the Voyagers, bearing the memories of a world that is no more, will fly on.

8
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,000
We can't know how much of the records they would understand,

9
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,100
but being much more advanced scientists and engineers than we -- otherwise,

10
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,800
they'd never be able to find and retrieve the small, silent spacecraft in interstellar space --

11
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,800
perhaps the aliens would have no difficulty understanding

12
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:34,300
what is encoded on these 'golden records.' Perhaps, they would recognize the tentativeness

13
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:40,900
of our society, the mismatch between our technology and our wisdom.

14
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,500
Had we destroyed ourselves since launching Voyager, they might wonder,

15
00:04:49,200 --> 00:00:00,000
or had we gone on to greater things.
