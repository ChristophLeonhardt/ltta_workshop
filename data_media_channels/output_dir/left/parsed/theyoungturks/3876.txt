HILLARY CLINTON BOOK IS GETTING
A LOT OF ATTENTION BECAUSE
SHE HAS WRITTEN SOME PRETTY
INSANE THINGS.
ONE OF THE MORE INSANE THINGS
THAT WAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT WAS A
PORTION OF HER BOOK WHERE SHE
COMPARES HERSELF TO CERSEI
LANNISTER FROM GAME OF THRONES.
LET ME READ YOU THAT PORTION 
OF
THE BOOK.
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
HAVE
NO IDEA WHO SHE IS, SHE IS BEST
KNOWN FOR BEING THE RUTHLESS
POWER-HUNGRY VILLAINOUS WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS
OF THOUSANDS JUST SO SHE CAN SIT
ON THE IRON THRONE.
WOW.
>>NOT THE COMPARISON YOU WANT TO
MAKE.
THAT WAS ONE SCENE WHERE
YOU FELT SYMPATHY FOR HER.
>>SHAME.
SHAME.
SHAME.
>> BETWEEN CERSEI LANNISTER AND
THEIR RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS YOU HAVE
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE LESSER OF
TWO EVILS, AND YOU ARE STUCK IN
A PRETTY BAD SITUATION AND YOU
REALLY DID NOT WANT TO GO WITH
THE RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS BUT CERSEI
LANNISTER WASN'T MUCH OF A
CHOICE EITHER.
IF YOU WANT TO TRY TO BE COOL,
DO A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH AND
ASK PEOPLE AROUND YOU IF CERSEI
IS A GOOD GUY OR BAD GUY.
IS A TYPICAL FAIL FROM A
CAMPAIGN THAT WAS OTHERWISE
GREAT IF IT WASN'T FOR
BERNIE, JAMES,, RUSSIA, THE
WEATHER, AND EVERYTHING ELSE â€“
SHE WOULD'VE ONE.
>> EVERY TIME ANYBODY BRINGS
ANYTHING UP AND YOU GUYS LAUGH
ABOUT IT, I WILL SAY I DON'T
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BUT I
AM NOT IN THE SPOTLIGHT.
IF I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND
I'M PUTTING SOMETHING OUT I
WOULD SAY WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
BEFORE I SAY IT.
IT IS SIMPLE.
>>IF YOU WATCH IT YOU KNOW
CERSEI IS NOT WHO YOU WANT TO
COMPARE YOURSELF TO.
ALMOST EVERY OTHER PERSON
WATCHES THAT SHOW IN AMERICA, SO
ASK SOMEONE THAT WATCHES THE
SHOW.
I COMPARE MYSELF TO LITTLE
FINGER BECAUSE I BELIEVE LORD
BAELISH NAILED IT.
