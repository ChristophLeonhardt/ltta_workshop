1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,259
A GOP LAWMAKER THINKS IT'S A BAD
IDEA THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO GET

2
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:07,800
TREATED IF THEY GO TO THE
EMERGENCY ROOM.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,800
IN FACT, SHE

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,670
THINKS THAT WE COULD SAVE
DOCTORS IN THIS WHOLE HEALTHCARE

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,330
SYSTEM A LOT OF MONEY IF WE
DIDN'T HAVE TO TREAT EVERYONE

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,360
THE SHUTTLE TO THE EMERGENCY
ROOM.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,400
THIS IS REPRESENTATIVE

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,660
DIANE BLACK.

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,599
SHE IS IN
TENNESSEE AND SHE WAS SPEAKING

10
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:24,669
TO CHUCK TODD ABOUT THIS ISSUE
AND I WANT YOU TO HEAR FROM

11
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:26,519
HER AND WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY.

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,519
TAKE A LOOK THAT.

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,939
YOU ARE BEING FORCED INTO
FIGURING OUT HOW TO

14
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:31,980
SUBSIDIZE THAT FREE HEALTHCARE
THAT NOBODY PAYS FOR AT THE

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,340
EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR.

16
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,950
LET ME TELL YOU, CHUCK THAT I
AM AN EMERGENCY ROOM NURSE.

17
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,910
THEIR PEOPLE CAME INTO MY
EMERGENCY ROOM THAT I, THE NURSE

18
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,230
WAS THE FIRST ONE TO SEE THEM
THAT I COULD'VE SENT THEM TO A

19
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,350
WALK-IN CLINIC OR THEIR DOCTOR
THE NEXT DAY BUT BECAUSE OF A

20
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,430
LAW THAT CONGRESS PUT INTO PLACE
TO SAY NO, I HAVE TO TREAT

21
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,720
EVERYONE THAT WALKS INTO THE
EMERGENCY ROOM, YOU TOOK AWAY

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,590
OUR ABILITY TO SAY NO.

23
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,730
AN
EMERGENCY ROOM IS NOT THE

24
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:56,970
PROPER PLACE.

25
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,880
AND THEN HE PUT A BURDEN ON TOP
OF THAT TO SAY YOU MUST DO THAT.

26
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,120
AND YOU WOULD GET RID OF THE
LAW THAT MANDATES EMERGENCY

27
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,810
ROOMS TO SEE EVERY PATIENT THAT
SHOWS UP.

28
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,570
I WOULD GET RID OF A LAW THAT
SAYS YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED AS

29
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,549
A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL TO
MAKE THAT DECISION ABOUT

30
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,530
WHETHER SOMEONE CAN BE
APPROPRIATELY TREATED THE

31
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,149
NEXT DAY OR AT A WALK-IN CLINIC
OR AT THEIR DOCTOR.

32
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:23,950
SO I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IF
ALL YOU HEARD WAS THAT YOU MIGHT

33
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,149
WALK AWAY THINKING, THAT SEEMS
REASONABLE.

34
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:27,170
THAT IS A PERSON

35
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,539
WHO PRACTICED THIS AS A NURSE
AND KNOWS WHAT IT IS AND SHE

36
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:34,590
SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE HER
JUDGMENT AND IF SOMEBODY

37
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,439
CAME IN WITH THE FLU YOU COULD
SAY HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

38
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:39,749
COME TO THE CLINIC TOMORROW
INSTEAD OF TAKING UP SPACE IN

39
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:41,649
THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

40
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:43,679
BUT THAT'S
IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE HISTORY OF

41
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:46,770
IT AND AS A CONGRESSWOMAN NOW
RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR, SHE SHOULD

42
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,899
KNOW IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND
THE CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD FLOW

43
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:49,899
FROM IT.

44
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:51,789
THE PERSON WHO
ACTUALLY SIGNED THE LAW INTO THE

45
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:55,450
EFFECT WAS A WELL-KNOWN LIBERAL
NAMED RONALD REAGAN.

46
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,020
IT WAS THE

47
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,009
EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT AND
ACTIVE LABOR ACT.

48
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:01,009
I'M GOING TO

49
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:03,189
PSYCHOACTIVE LABOR IN THE SECOND
BUT THE REASON THEY DID IT IS

50
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,950
BECAUSE BACK IN THE DAY
HOSPITALS WOULD DO WITH A CALLED

51
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,950
PATIENT DUMPING.

52
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,110
SOMEONE
WALKING TO THE HOSPITAL AND THEY

53
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,409
WOULD GO HE DOESN'T HAVE
INSURANCE AND IT IS GOING TO

54
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:17,069
COST A LOT AND THEY WOULD JUST
REFUSE TO TREAT HIM AND THEY

55
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,909
WOULD EITHER JUST DRIVE THEM OUT
TO THE STREET AND SAY GOODBYE

56
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:23,140
AND GOOD LUCK OR THEY WOULD MAKE
IT THIS DIFFERENT HOSPITAL TAKE

57
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,330
THEM AND THEY KEPT DOING THIS
PATIENT DUMPING TO THE POINT

58
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,030
THAT CONGRESS HAD TO PASS THE
LAW AND REAGAN SIGNED INTO

59
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,319
EFFECT.

60
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,350
SO BEFORE YOU GO
RUNNING AROUND TALKING ABOUT,

61
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,030
THEY TOOK MY FREEDOM AWAY TO
DENY YOU HEALTHCARE.

62
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,030
LOOK INTO

63
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,120
IT A LITTLE BIT AND FIND OUT,
NORMALLY I THINK OF THE LAWS

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,100
OUTRAGEOUS, THERE MUST'VE BEEN A
GOOD REASON FOR THAT MAYBE AT

65
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,459
SOME POINT, LET ME FIND OUT WHY
DOTS AND SHE DIDN'T OF COURSE DO

66
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:54,230
THAT AND ACTIVE LABOR PART IS
BECAUSE WOMEN WOULD, IN PREGNANT

67
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,219
IN THE MIDDLE OF LABOR AND
HOSPITALS WOULD DUMP THEM ANYWAY

68
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,670
IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE
AND SO THAT IS WHY EVEN THE

69
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,090
PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT WAS LIKE THAT
IS A FETUS.

70
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,090
THAT IS THE ONE

71
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,360
THING WE CARE ABOUT.

72
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,879
AND YOU ARE SENDING THEM AWAY IN
THE MIDDLE OF LABOR?

73
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,670
THAT CAN COST OR MEND HIS
PROBLEM SO THAT IS WHERE

74
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,860
THEY PASS THE LAWN
THE FIRST PLACE.

75
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,790
THAT IS WHY THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY.

76
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,379
YOU ARE GIVING HER THE
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT IN SAYING

77
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:25,519
THAT MAYBE SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE
HISTORY OF WHY THIS LAW WASN'T

78
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,390
ACTED IN THE FIRST PLACE, BUT I
THINK EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY

79
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,239
SOMEONE WHO'S A CURRENT LAWMAKER
KNOWS THAT EMERGENCY ROOM'S END

80
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,650
UP SERVING AS A LAST RESORT FOR
THE POOR WHO HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

81
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,209
TO PROVIDE OR PAY FOR
HEALTHCARE, WHO HAVEN'T HAD

82
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:44,769
ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE AND
SO THEIR HEALTH CONDITIONS GET

83
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:47,870
SO BAD THAT THEY END UP IN
EMERGENCY ROOMS.

84
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,769
YEAH, THEY

85
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:52,200
SHOULD BE SEEN BY DOCTORS IF
THEY SHOW UP TO THE EMERGENCY

86
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,269
ROOM AND LOOK, MAYBE I AM TOO
REAL AND MAYBE I SEE THE DARK

87
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:00,790
SIDE OF HUMANITY A LITTLE TOO
MUCH BUT I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO

88
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,920
BE THE ARBITER OF WHETHER OR NOT
SOMEONE DESERVES CARE THAT

89
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,940
MOMENT.

90
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,140
SO SHE BRINGS UP
SOMEONE WHO HAS A SORE THROAT

91
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,999
FOR A WEEK OR SOMEONE WHOM I
HAVE THE FLU BUT I AM NOT BUYING

92
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:13,909
FOR A SECOND THAT THOSE ARE THE
ONLY INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD BE

93
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:14,950
TURNED AWAY.

94
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,279
WE ALL KNOW THAT
MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE TURNED AWAY

95
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,359
FOR MORE SERIOUS CONDITIONS AND
SOMETIMES YOU GO TO THE

96
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,560
EMERGENCY ROOM NOT KNOWING
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU AND MAYBE

97
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,340
THE SYMPTOMS DON'T SEEM THAT
SERIOUS TO THE PERSON YOU ARE

98
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,720
DESCRIBING IT TO THAT IT MIGHT
END UP BEING SOMETHING

99
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,460
INCREDIBLY SERIOUS.

100
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,590
WHAT IF YOU JUST GOT HIT IN THE
HEAD AND YOU ARE WORRIED

101
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,500
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SUFFER A
CONCUSSION?

102
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,800
THESE ARE THINGS YOU SHOULD BE
TREATED FOR AND SO WHEN YOU KNOW

103
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,220
THE HISTORY AND WHEN YOU KNOW
THAT DEMOGRAPHIC THAT TYPICALLY

104
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,319
ENDS UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM,
YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THAT LAW

105
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,970
WASN'T ACTED IN THE FIRST PLACE
BUT BY THE WAY, ANOTHER THING I

106
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,430
WANTED TO STAY IS THAT IF YOU
ARE A HOSPITAL THAT IS NOT

107
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,380
RECEIVING ANY MEDICARE FUNDS,
YOU CAN TURN PEOPLE AWAY.

108
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,380
IT IS

109
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,880
TO SIT IF YOU ARE RECEIVING
TAXPAYER MONEY, YOU CAN'T DO IT.

110
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,450
YOU CAN'T TURN IT AWAY.

111
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,620
SO IF
YOU ARE GENUINELY AGAINST THIS

112
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,000
TYPE OF LAW AND YOU DON'T WANT
TO ABIDE BY IT THEN STOP

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,160
RECEIVING MEDICARE MONEY AND
THEN HE CAN GO AHEAD AND

114
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
PATIENT.

115
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,170
AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.

116
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,640
HERE IN LA AND OUR HEALTHCARE

117
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,690
PLAN WE HAVE URGENT CARE AS
OPPOSED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

118
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,820
IS FOR LIGHTER STUFF THAT
HAPPENS TO YOU AND I LOVE IT

119
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,539
BECAUSE EVERYBODY OF COURSE
KNOWS THE LINES IN THE EMERGENCY

120
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:26,539
ROOM.

121
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:27,539
IT'S A REAL HASSLE.

122
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,099
WE
KNOW THAT THAT IS A REAL ISSUE

123
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:32,560
SO URGENT CARE HAS COME UP NOW
AND THAT'S MUCH BETTER IN THE

124
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
SYSTEM.

125
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,740
SO WE'RE NOT SAYING
THAT THE LINES IN THE EMERGENCY

126
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,440
ROOM ARE NOT AN ISSUE BUT
REMEMBER, IT'S NOT LIKE THE

127
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,600
TREATMENT REQUIRES YOU TO TAKE
SEVEN HOURS WITH THE PERSON.

128
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,360
THEY JUST HAVE A SORE THROAT AND
THEY SAT THERE WHATEVER THEY HAD

129
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,000
TO SIT THROUGH AND THEY GOT TO
YOU SAY OKAY IS A BILL FOR YOUR

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,750
THROAT AND WE'RE DONE WITH IT.

131
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,370
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU ARE MANDATED

132
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,419
TO DO ANYTHING ELSE.

133
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,039
IN FACT,
IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE YOU

134
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,599
ALMOST THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME
TO DISMISS THAT.

135
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:56,599
BECAUSE HOW DO

136
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:58,360
YOU KNOW IF THEY HAVE A SORE
THROAT OR THEY DON'T.

137
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,030
WHICH LEADS TO THE STORY OF MINE
WHICH IS PRETTY TRAGIC.

138
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,030
REALLY

139
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,030
GOOD FRIEND OF MINE.

140
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,030
FATHER OF
HIS WAS IN TURKEY AND EXISTENCE

141
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,780
OF WHAT COULD GO WRONG.

142
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,780
HIS
FATHER WAS INVOLVED IN AN

143
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,370
ACCIDENT AND THE DOCTORS LOOKED
AT HIM AND THOUGHT HE WAS FINE.

144
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,090
IT TURNS OUT THEY WERE
NEGLIGENT.

145
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,090
HE WASN'T FINE.

146
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,389
HE HAD INTERNAL BLEEDING AND HE
DIED.

147
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:19,979
SO THAT IS WHY, WHEN YOU

148
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,729
GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM YES,
SOMEONE SHOULD TAKE A COUPLE

149
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:27,780
MINUTES OUT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE
OKAY AND NOT DUMP YOU ON THE

150
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,840
STREETS AND GO I AM USING MY
GOOD JUDGMENT TO MAKE SURE I

151
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,160
DON'T TREAT YOU.

152
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,150
THAT IS NOT
THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE SHOULD

153
00:06:34,150 --> 00:00:00,000
BE.
