When I was 12 my mother had an unexpected, baby
I
Wanted to learn how to do everything feed her change her entertain her
She was kind of scoring me, and she never liked to get her nails clipped
and so I went to clip this one nail and almost cut the tip of her thumb off I
Swooped her up and ran downstairs and called my mother. She just really calmly
Told me to wrap something around her thumb distract her and just make sure that she was
comfortable
You know you don't learn everything first and then apply it it all just happens and figure it out
When I was 18 they told me that I had PCOS
They've always said when you get older. It's gonna be hard for you to have children I
Was 25 working for a financial company, I was also hostessing on a bar at night I
thought I was just like gaining weight, and I was just like so tired I
Had been on the pill. I was like. Eh, maybe I should just take a pregnancy test I
was terrified I
Was finishing a PhD and that seemed like a reasonable time to start thinking about having a baby
I
Really didn't think there was anything wrong
We finally went to see reproductive endocrinologist
At 30 I had no eggs it made me feel cheated
Trying to do things according to some kind of plan was obviously not working I
Found out that I was you know five months 20 weeks along
they said that I could go you know if I did want to terminate the pregnancy there are a few states I
Cried on my sister shoulder probably the whole day I still felt like a baby
It just felt like this incredible slap in the face
My baby sister is now gonna. Have a baby and I'm gonna have to help
because I love her so much and I
Would do anything for her?
And yet, I thought this would be the hardest thing I would ever have to do
She was like if you
Want to terminate I'm there with you and I'll fly with you
I will totally support you and any choice a you make I
Think I asked her once or twice even then are you sure I would be okay if you weren't sure
I never thought about changing my mind I
Slept in her hospital room
With our boy on the cot with me curled up three of us for that first night
I remember saying do you see now yeah you see what you gave to me? I?
hope you
realized how
Huge
That was I mean yeah
It's the bravest most amazing thing I've ever seen anyone do
You
