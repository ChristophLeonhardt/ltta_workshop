1
00:00:00,112 --> 00:00:00,612
>> THANK YOU.

2
00:00:00,612 --> 00:00:01,313
>> Jason: BEST REPORTERS SO

3
00:00:01,313 --> 00:00:02,948
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US

4
00:00:02,948 --> 00:00:03,849
TONIGHT AND THANK YOU FOR

5
00:00:03,849 --> 00:00:05,717
GREAT PIECE YOU PUT OUT.

6
00:00:05,717 --> 00:00:07,285
ALSO, YESTERDAY, HOUSE

7
00:00:07,285 --> 00:00:08,653
INTELLIGENCE CHAIRMAN, THE

8
00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:09,654
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN DEVIN NUNES

9
00:00:09,654 --> 00:00:11,156
AND THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT

10
00:00:11,156 --> 00:00:12,557
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN TREY GOWDY

11
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:13,325
ACTUALLY WENT TO THE

12
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:15,293
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO VIEW

13
00:00:15,293 --> 00:00:15,827
DOCUMENTS.

14
00:00:15,827 --> 00:00:17,629
THEY HAVE BEEN ASKING AND WERE

15
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:18,663
UNDER SUBPOENA FOR MONTHS.

16
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:22,033
BUT SOURCES TELL FOX NEWS THAT

17
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:26,104
NUNES AND GOWDY WERE ONLY

18
00:00:26,104 --> 00:00:26,438
BRIEFED.

19
00:00:26,438 --> 00:00:27,472
ANOTHER MEETING IS SCHEDULED

20
00:00:27,472 --> 00:00:28,540
FOR THEM TO SEE IT.

21
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,175
BUT THE BEST WAY TO GET THE

22
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:31,810
INFORMATION IS TALK TO SOMEONE

23
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,778
IN THE MEETING.

24
00:00:32,778 --> 00:00:35,814
TREY GOWDY AND ALSO JOHN

25
00:00:35,814 --> 00:00:36,915
RATCLIFFE FROM TEXAS.

26
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:37,816
BOTH ARE FEDERAL PROSECUTORS

27
00:00:37,816 --> 00:00:38,650
AND BEEN THROUGH THE SYSTEM

28
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,651
AND THROUGH THE PROCESS.

29
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:40,952
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON

30
00:00:40,952 --> 00:00:43,121
THIS BEAUTIFUL FRIDAY NIGHT.

31
00:00:43,121 --> 00:00:44,756
CHAIRMAN GOWDY, DID YOU GET A

32
00:00:44,756 --> 00:00:46,458
LOT OF LIP SERVICE?

33
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:47,826
DID YOU GET TO READ THE

34
00:00:47,826 --> 00:00:48,226
DOCUMENTS?

35
00:00:48,226 --> 00:00:50,095
WHAT DID THEY TELL YOU?

36
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:51,530
>> JASON, IT WAS A PRODUCTIVE

37
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,631
MEETING YESTERDAY.

38
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:55,066
I THINK EVERY QUESTION I ASKED

39
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:57,469
THE BUREAU AND THE DEPARTMENT

40
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:02,107
NOW UNDERSTAND THEY ARE

41
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:04,575
RELEVANT, MATERIAL, THEY ARE

42
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:05,277
SPECIFIC AND POINTED.

43
00:01:05,277 --> 00:01:06,478
THERE IS A REASON CONGRESS

44
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:07,445
WANTS TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO

45
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:08,613
THE QUESTIONS.

46
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:10,582
IT WAS A CONSTRUCTIVE -- I

47
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:12,150
KNOW THAT IS NOT GOOD NEWS

48
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,418
FROM THE MEDIA STANDPOINT THAT

49
00:01:13,418 --> 00:01:15,520
WE HAD A BORING, CONSTRUCTIVE

50
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,588
MEETING YESTERDAY BUT THAT IS

51
00:01:16,588 --> 00:01:17,322
WHAT IT WAS.

52
00:01:17,322 --> 00:01:18,924
SO CONSTRUCTIVE WE HAVE AGREED

53
00:01:18,924 --> 00:01:19,758
TO MEET NEXT WEEK.

54
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:26,765
YOU ASK IF WE SAW SOMETHING.

55
00:01:26,765 --> 00:01:30,302
I CAN LEARN WITH MY EARS AND

56
00:01:30,302 --> 00:01:30,769
MY EYES.

57
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:32,337
I CAN GOT TO ASK QUESTIONS.

58
00:01:32,337 --> 00:01:34,306
WE WERE PROSECUTORS AND I KNOW

59
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:36,474
THE QUESTIONS TO ASK IN AN

60
00:01:36,474 --> 00:01:43,515
INVESTIGATION LIKE THIS.

61
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:44,115
YESTERDAY WAS ACTUALLY

62
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:44,583
PRODUCTIVE.

63
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,183
>> Jason: WHEN DO YOU

64
00:01:45,183 --> 00:01:45,984
ACTUALLY GET TO SEE THEM?

65
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,885
>> WELL, LET ME SAY THIS.

66
00:01:46,885 --> 00:01:48,687
I WORKED IN ALL THREE BRANCHES

67
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:49,120
OF GOVERNMENT.

68
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,223
THERE IS TENSION, THERE

69
00:01:51,223 --> 00:01:52,390
INTENTIONAL TENSION PUT

70
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,258
BETWEEN THE BRANCHES.

71
00:01:53,258 --> 00:01:54,593
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT

72
00:01:54,593 --> 00:01:55,827
HAPPEN IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH

73
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:56,928
THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS CAN'T

74
00:01:56,928 --> 00:01:57,229
SEE.

75
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,563
THERE ARE THINGS THAT HAPPEN

76
00:01:58,563 --> 00:02:00,198
IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THAT

77
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:01,933
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS CAN'T SEE.

78
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:03,869
THERE ARE THINGS WE DO, JASON,

79
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,570
AS YOU RECALL IN CONGRESS WE

80
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,439
DON'T LET ANYBODY ELSE SEE.

81
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,642
THAT TENSION WE HAVE GOT TO

82
00:02:10,642 --> 00:02:11,877
WORK THROUGH.

83
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:12,911
I LEARNED INFORMATION THIS

84
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:13,278
WEEK.

85
00:02:13,278 --> 00:02:14,713
YOU STILL WANT TO SEE THE

86
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:15,080
DOCUMENTS.

87
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,381
THEY HAVE TAKEN THE REQUEST

88
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:18,250
UNDER ADVISEMENT AND

89
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,251
REGRETTING FARTHER TAKING THIS

90
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:20,785
APPROACH, MEETING EYEBALL TO

91
00:02:20,785 --> 00:02:23,722
EYEBALL OPPOSED TO EXCHANGING

92
00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:24,990
LETTERS AND SEEING WHO CAN

93
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,824
LEAK THEM THE QUICKEST.

94
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:27,158
THAT IS NOT CONSTRUCTIVE.

95
00:02:27,158 --> 00:02:28,560
WHAT IS CONSTRUCTIVE IS TO

96
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,728
HAVE A CONVERSATION AND WE'RE

97
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:30,896
MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD ACCESS

98
00:02:30,896 --> 00:02:31,396
THE DOCUMENT.

99
00:02:31,396 --> 00:02:32,530
>> Jason: IT'S A SHAME THAT

100
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,199
NUNES HAD TO ISSUE A SUBPOENA

101
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:37,035
AND THREATEN CONTEMPT AND THE

102
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:38,136
SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN IN TREY

103
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:39,137
GOWDY COMING OUT.

104
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:41,439
I'M GLAD YOU ARE MAKING

105
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,908
INCREMENTAL PROGRESS STEP BY

106
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:43,275
STEP.

107
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:45,143
I WANT TO GO TO JOHN RATCLIFFE

108
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:46,745
AND GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON

109
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:47,345
JAMES COMEY.

110
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:48,780
HE IS FRESH OFF A BOOK TOUR

111
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,148
AND HE HAS SAID A LOT OF

112
00:02:50,148 --> 00:02:51,283
THINGS AND WE HAVE LEARNED

113
00:02:51,283 --> 00:02:52,784
MORE ABOUT DIRECTOR COMEY.

114
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:54,019
HAS HE MADE THE SITUATION

115
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:55,220
BETTER OR WORSE FOR HIMSELF

116
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,454
AFTER THE BOOK TOUR AND THE

117
00:02:56,454 --> 00:02:57,589
THINGS WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT

118
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:58,990
HIS ACTIONS WHILE HE WAS THE

119
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,695
F.B.I. DIRECTOR?

120
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:05,330
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

121
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,865
ONE THING THAT HAS COME OUT OF

122
00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:08,133
JAMES COMEY'S INTERVIEWS ON

123
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:10,335
THE BOOK TOUR AND THE RELEASE

124
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:12,737
OF HIS SECRET MEMOS, IT'S

125
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:14,272
IRONIC TO ME THAT HE IS THE

126
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:15,440
ONE THAT CREATED THE

127
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,942
ALLEGATION OF OBSTRUCTION OF

128
00:03:16,942 --> 00:03:18,076
JUSTICE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.

129
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:19,611
NOW HE IS THE SAME PERSON WHO

130
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:25,583
HAS EFFECTIVEL TORPEDOED THE

131
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,152
ABILITY TO PROVE OBSTRUCTION.

132
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:28,753
I SAY THAT BECAUSE THE 15

133
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:30,689
PAGES OF THE SECRET MEMOS

134
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:32,123
NEVER MENTION "OBSTRUCTION OF

135
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:33,158
JUSTICE" A SINGLE TIME.

136
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:36,161
IN FACT, ONE OF THE MEMOS DOES

137
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:37,262
THE OPPOSITE.

138
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:38,496
IT SAYS THAT IT IS AN

139
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:39,631
ADMISSION BY THE FORMER

140
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:40,765
DIRECTOR THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

141
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:43,034
ASKED HIM TO FULLY INVESTIGATE

142
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:45,971
WHETHER OR NOT ANYONE, THAT

143
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:47,739
COLLUDING WITH THE RUSSIANS.

144
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:49,574
THAT IS WHY TREY AND I REFER

145
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:52,243
TO THE MEMO AS DEFENSE EXHIBIT

146
00:03:52,243 --> 00:03:54,112
"A" IN ANY CHARGES THAT WOULD

147
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:55,113
BE BROUGHT AGAINST DONALD

148
00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:55,447
TRUMP.

149
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:57,248
I THINK HE HAS ALSO HURT THE

150
00:03:57,248 --> 00:03:58,350
MUELLER CASE AND THE ABILITY

151
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,150
TO PROVE THAT.

152
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,785
YOU CAN'T BUILD A CASE AROUND

153
00:04:00,785 --> 00:04:03,588
A STAR WITNESS WHO HAS DAMAGED

154
00:04:03,588 --> 00:04:04,990
HIS OWN CREDIBILITY AND HURT

155
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,158
HIS OWN REPUTATION AS I THINK

156
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:08,593
JAMES COMEY HAS DONE OVER THE

157
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:09,761
LAST FEW WEEKS ON THIS BOOK

158
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:10,161
TOUR.

159
00:04:10,161 --> 00:04:12,063
>> Jason: DO YOU THINK --

160
00:04:12,063 --> 00:04:13,832
DOES HE HAVE ANY LEGAL

161
00:04:13,832 --> 00:04:16,134
JEOPARDY HIMSELF, DIRECTOR

162
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:16,601
COMEY?

163
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:17,836
>> I THINK THE BEST ANSWER TO

164
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:19,170
THAT, JASON, WILL COME WITH

165
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,940
THE RELEASE OF THE INSPECTOR

166
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,640
GENERAL REPORT.

167
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,476
YOU KNOW WE ALL ANTICIPATE

168
00:04:24,476 --> 00:04:26,277
THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN SHORTLY.

169
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:27,946
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE

170
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:30,048
INSPECTOR GENERAL MICHAEL

171
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:31,016
HOROWITZ HAS PROVEN HIMSELF TO

172
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:32,550
BE A FAIR UMPIRE.

173
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,185
SOMEONE WHO CALLS BALLS AND

174
00:04:34,185 --> 00:04:39,257
STRIKES FAIRLY AND WHERE

175
00:04:39,257 --> 00:04:40,658
APPROPRIATE MAKING CRIMINAL

176
00:04:40,658 --> 00:04:43,828
REFERRAL OF THE DEPUTY

177
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:44,195
DIRECTOR.

178
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:46,064
HAVING NOT HAVING SEEN THE

179
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:47,599
REPORT I'D BE SURPRISED IF

180
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:49,134
THEY DON'T FIND MISCONDUCT BY

181
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:50,201
FORMER DIRECTOR COMEY.

182
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:51,770
I THINK HE WILL FIND THAT HE

183
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,571
VIOLATED THE EMPLOYMENT

184
00:04:53,571 --> 00:04:54,639
AGREEMENT AND MADE

185
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,774
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURES OF

186
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:56,841
THE F.B.I. DOCUMENTS.

187
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:58,209
WHETHER THEY ARE CLASSIFIED OR

188
00:04:58,209 --> 00:04:59,878
NOT, THEY ARE IMPROPER LEAKS.

189
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:08,853
I THINK YOU WILL FIND HE MADE

190
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:10,588
DEMONSTRABLY FALSE STATEMENTS.

191
00:05:10,588 --> 00:05:11,790
THEY HAVE CONFLICTED WITH THE

192
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:20,999
PUBLIC INTERVIEWS HE IS GIVEN.

193
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:22,100
I THINK MICHAEL HOROWITZ WILL

194
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,934
MAKE IF RECOMMENDATION.

195
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:24,602
>> Jason: WHEN DO YOU THINK

196
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:26,771
WE WILL SEE THIS?

197
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:27,806
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT OUT OF

198
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:28,106
THIS?

199
00:05:28,106 --> 00:05:30,075
DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE ANY

200
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:31,309
CRIMINAL REFERRALS COMING FROM

201
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:31,709
THIS?

202
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:34,979
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE

203
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,148
CRIMINAL REFERRALS.

204
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:38,683
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS I TRY TO

205
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:40,952
AVOID ACCUSING PEOPLE OF

206
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:41,653
COMMITTING CRIMES.

207
00:05:41,653 --> 00:05:42,687
THAT WAS MY OLD JOB.

208
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:44,089
I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO DO IT.

209
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:46,458
ALL THREE OF US HAVE

210
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,559
TREMENDOUS CONFIDENCE IN

211
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:48,660
MICHAEL HOROWITZ, THE

212
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,661
INSPECTOR GENERAL.

213
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:51,863
A FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR.

214
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:54,132
A STRAIGHT ARROW.

215
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:54,566
FACT-CENTRIC.

216
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:55,900
I THINK THE REASON IT IS

217
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,436
TAKING LONGER, JASON, THAN HE

218
00:05:58,436 --> 00:05:59,804
ANTICIPATED IS HE IS FINDING

219
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:00,371
MORE INFORMATION.

220
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:02,340
SO WHAT I WOULD TELL MY

221
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,142
COLLEAGUES IN THE HOUSE GIVE

222
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:05,844
HIM THE TIME, INDEPENDENCE AND

223
00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:07,045
THE RESOURCES TO DO EVERYTHING

224
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:08,313
HE NEEDS TO DO.

225
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:09,547
I KNOW WE WANTED IT IN

226
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:10,882
FEBRUARY AND MARCH AND THAT IS

227
00:06:10,882 --> 00:06:12,784
HUMAN NATURE TO WANT IT

228
00:06:12,784 --> 00:06:14,018
QUICKER BUT I WANT IT TO BE

229
00:06:14,018 --> 00:06:14,385
COMPLETE.

230
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:16,387
I WANT IT TO BE FULSOME.

231
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:18,189
I WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO

232
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:19,057
HAVE CONFIDENCE IN WHAT

233
00:06:19,057 --> 00:06:19,891
HOROWITZ HAS DONE.

234
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:21,392
IF HE COULD REPRESENT THAT HE

235
00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:23,294
IS ACCESSED EVERY DOCUMENT AND

236
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:27,532
EVERY WITNESS, I MEAN HE FOUND

237
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:30,502
THE PAGE-STROZK TEXT AND FOUND

238
00:06:30,502 --> 00:06:31,703
SOME WERE DELETED AND THROUGH

239
00:06:31,703 --> 00:06:33,238
HIS HELP THEY WERE

240
00:06:33,238 --> 00:06:34,172
RECONSTRUCTED.

241
00:06:34,172 --> 00:06:35,340
I'M AS IMPATIENT AS EVERYONE

242
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:35,673
ELSE.

243
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:36,407
I KNOW THIS.

244
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:39,744
I WANT HOROWITZ TO PRESENT A

245
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:40,979
FULSOME PICTURE WHEN HE COMES.

246
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,847
IF IT MEANS WAITING ANOTHER

247
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:44,215
COUPLE OF WEEKS SO BE IT.

248
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:45,750
>> Jason: DO YOU HAVE A

249
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,084
DATE?

250
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:47,552
DO WE HAVE A DATE WHEN YOU ARE

251
00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:48,520
HAVING THE HEARING?

252
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,787
>> WE HAVE SET ONE AND WE

253
00:06:49,787 --> 00:06:50,288
MOVED IT.

254
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:51,422
YOU REMEMBER HOW THAT USED TO

255
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:51,789
BE.

256
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:53,391
WE ARE SHOOTING FOR THE FIRST

257
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:53,992
WEEK OF JUNE.

258
00:06:53,992 --> 00:06:55,593
I WILL SAY WITH THIS CAVEAT.

259
00:06:55,593 --> 00:06:58,897
YOU KNOW HOROWITZ, JASON.

260
00:06:58,897 --> 00:07:00,498
HE IS NOT GIVING ME ANY

261
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:01,599
UPDATES ON HIS INVESTIGATION,

262
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,468
NOR SHOULD HE, NOR WOULD I

263
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:05,170
ASK.

264
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:06,204
LIKE TO SCHEDULE THE HEARING

265
00:07:06,204 --> 00:07:08,206
AND I WILL PICK A DATE AND HE

266
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:09,541
WILL TELL ME WHETHER OR NOT HE

267
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,309
THINKS HE WILL MAKE THE TARGET

268
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:12,143
DATE OR NOT.

269
00:07:12,143 --> 00:07:13,311
I HAVE NO INSIDE INFORMATION

270
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:14,712
AND I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO.

271
00:07:14,712 --> 00:07:16,147
>> Jason: REAL QUICKLY,

272
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:17,348
CONGRESSMAN RATCLIFFE IN TEN

273
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:19,150
SECONDS, DIRECTOR MUELLER.

274
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,351
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT

275
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:21,252
CONTINUES TO GO ON?

276
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:22,754
WILL IT IMPACT THE 2018

277
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:26,391
ELECTION OR WILL HE WRAP THIS

278
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:29,561
THING UP?

279
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:31,696
>> HI HAS TO BE CAREFUL -- I

280
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:32,931
THINK HE HAS TO BE VERY

281
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:34,265
CAREFUL.

282
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:36,267
MUELLER HAS TO NOT MAKE THE

283
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:37,802
MISTAKE THAT THEY CRITICIZED

284
00:07:37,802 --> 00:07:39,604
COMEY FOR TO ALLOW THE

285
00:07:39,604 --> 00:07:42,740
INVESTIGATION TO IMPACT AN

286
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,107
ELECTION.

287
00:07:43,107 --> 00:07:44,142
WHICH THE REPUBLICANS AND THE

288
00:07:44,142 --> 00:07:45,643
DEMOCRATS AGREED HAPPENED IN

289
00:07:45,643 --> 00:07:46,077
2016.

290
00:07:46,077 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Jason: GENTLEMEN, IT'S
