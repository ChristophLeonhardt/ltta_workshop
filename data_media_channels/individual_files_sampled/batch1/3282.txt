obviously any foreign breach of our cyber security measures is disturbing and I strongly condemn any such efforts if you look at the story and you take a look at what they said there's great confusion nobody really knows and hacking is very interesting once they hack if you don't catch them in the act you're not going to catch them they have no idea of its Russia or China or somebody it could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace I don't know who did the hacking Chuck the article is based on a lie that the RNC was hacked so the entire premise of the article is false the sources are unnamed and the report was inconclusive listen I don't want anyone hacked okay the point is though we need to find out more facts about this situation then we can make intelligent decisions later and you and I can have more intelligent conversation about what to do about it the fact that the CIA and FBI disagree shows the need for a bipartisan investigation that gets to the bottom of this the investigation should be tough strong and bipartisan and should have access to all materials classified and not the Russians have interfere din a lot of other elections the Russians have hacked into some of our most secret military information the Russians have been active using as a tool as part of Vladimir Putin's ambition to regain Russian prominence and dominance in some parts of the world we got to take a hard look at the role that the Russians played in this election process we will see where the investigation goes but but Donald Trump to summarily dismiss all of this makes no sense to me at all obviously any foreign breach of our cyber security measures is disturbing and I strongly condemn any such efforts I agree with Senator Schumer's chairman McCain burr and others this simply cannot be a partisan issue
