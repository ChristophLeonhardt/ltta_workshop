1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,040
Valued at nearly $10 billion dollars,

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,140
Theranos and its CEO were flying high in Silicon Valley,

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,500
but the blood-testing startup

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,100
wasn’t all that it seemed.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,920
My first tip came in early 2015.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,340
A former employee who had agreed to talk anonymously

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,820
was alleging the possibility of fraud

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,600
and public endangerment,

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,080
so I talked to my editor, Mike Siconolfi,

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,760
and he agreed I should investigate.

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,040
I began tracking down corroborating sources,

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,260
which wasn’t easy due to the NDAs everyone had signed.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,320
After months spent collecting the accounts

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,719
of whistleblowers, doctors, and patients,

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,980
it became clear that Theranos was misrepresenting

16
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,080
the scope and the accuracy of their technology.

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,640
When we confronted them with our findings,

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,800
they responded by threatening us with litigation,

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,520
intimidating our sources,

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,280
and pressuring us to kill the story.

21
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,780
Despite the harassment and legal threats,

22
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,220
the Journal held its ground

23
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,660
and published my 10-month long investigation in October of that year.

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,440
The response was explosive.

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,040
People woke up to the excesses of the Silicon Valley boom.

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,840
Eventually, federal health regulators

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,720
corroborated our reporting,

28
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,980
forcing Theranos to void tens of thousands of blood tests

29
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,080
that could have endangered the public.

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,620
The SEC and Justice Department also launched investigations,

31
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,980
triggering a wave of lawsuits and dire consequences

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,940
that would heavily impact the company.

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
To this day, the fallout continues,

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,580
and I intend to cover it to the very end.

35
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,560
My name is John Carreyrou,

36
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,660
and I’m an Investigative Reporter

37
00:01:33,660 --> 00:00:00,000
for The Wall Street Journal.
