huge mobs of left-wingers took to the streets of Hamburg Germany during the g20 conference over the weekend starting violent riots injured hundreds of people and destroyed the livelihood of the locals as part of the left's ceaseless attempt to bring peace and economic justice to the world the leftists were protesting something something something in the hopes of establishing something else or perhaps raising awareness of something and somehow making the world a better place by wearing masks and hitting people with sticks before setting fire to their stores the rioters describe themselves as anti-fascists the word fascist here meaning someone who oppresses people with violence and the word anti meaning absolutely nothing left-wing anarchist hooligan Bund Umberger was kind enough to take time off from beating a woman into the pavement to answer our questions about his motives von dun Berger said quote unbridled capitalism is elevated many nations to untold wealth and freedom lifting people around the world out of poverty and leading to advances in technology farming and education never before seen in history this must stop and be replaced by socialism which makes everything mediocre and miserable then at last everyone will be as unhappy as I am because my mother never loved me and I'm overweight unquote mr. von dung Berger then took a picture of himself protesting capitalism with his iPhone 7 and returned to beating up innocent people for the greater good another protester Francois Nazi face said he was burning stores and driving hardworking locals into poverty in order to give voice to the complaints of marginalized sexual perverts mr. Nazi face said quote here in the West we must have serious discussions about men who pretend they're women as if that were some kind of a thing instead of a mental illness that had been turned into a political issue because we have no real problems if a child who has been designated as a boy plays with a dhow his body must be mutilated and injected with destructive hormones so that he grows up psychotic enough to believe the gender is mutable before killing himself only then will every sexual justice in the world unquote yet another rider we interviewed was Fernando Fernando Gonzalez Riviera Diego Fernando nicknamed el useless stupido who rested from throwing rocks at the police long enough to tell us why he was rioting el stupido said quote basically I am a criminal who enjoys hurting people and destroying things and so I became a leftist because leftism offered me the best opportunities for travel and promotion unquote and a final rider we spoke to was New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio who left his city during a vigil for a murdered police officer in order to join the Hamburg protests against something something something and to establish a better something somewhere other than the city he's supposed to be running de Blasio said quote I am here in solidarity with these rioters thugs and criminals because I am an idiotic lowlife and a leftist but I repeat myself unquote trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show just take it easy there's a way we also sing she sits atop the low altitudes if anything it's a wonder and here we are on our beautiful new set and I promised you there would be naked dancing girls and chocolate fountains and elephants and they're all here but it's a family show so we have to keep them behind the camera but let me tell you they are gorgeous I mean it is a beautiful beautiful thing to see and the rest of it it looks pretty nice as well and if our technology works which is an open question even having a

Washington DC all the way from Washington DC I call him this because we were in Dallas and we went to see the spot where John F Kennedy was shot obviously a history-making spot and Noel's picked some grass off the hill and tweeted out a picture of himself as the grassy knolls to which somebody on Twitter responded too soon Knowles too stupid oh so one talking I should say Knowles is going to come

for the year and then my friend you get the leftist tears mug the official leftist tears mug out of which I'm drinking actual leftist tears that's how it works and you could get that for an annual subscription plus you get to be in the mailbag ask all your questions while I'm plugging things go over to city journal and read my new short story the end of the Working Day you will be glad you did we'll read it and say you are happy that you read this so this week this last week I just feel like the left is in flames I mean we had two things going on on the one hand I know they kind of suppress a lot of these images in the mainstream media but Hamburg was on fire I mean it was hundreds of people were injured flames and these anarchists and socialists and all these people nobody even knows what they're protesting nobody knows what they want do they want to be less free or less rich or something and meanwhile I don't want to make too big a thing out of this but I really have to bring this up about Donald Trump and the Marines I mean I'm sure most of you saw this but just in case here's CNN and you can just hear I don't not sure who this is it sounds a little like Allison camera or whatever name is but if you just hear the pain at having to report something that obviously makes Donald Trump look good watch Trump as he picks up the hat of a Marine after it blows off the Marines head the president has returned to the US this from just moments ago you've gotta come and watch this this was actually a light moment we just wanted to play it for you provide a little a little release as we recovered all the serious news you see a marine alongside marine one lost his cap the president goes to help put it back in it falls off again as he passed them on the side he goes he grabs it again so windy obviously from the helicopter he's trying to right the ship here and help out the marine who's standing alongside apparently cannot move from his current position and then the president board so obviously the chopper blades were blowing and it blows off the Marines hat he's not allowed to leave his position guards outside well now just standard attention but it wasn't moment really he's saying or promise me in tweets he raids the office of the presidency this moment he elevated devotion presidency especially in light of the last president long Thomas all of the shadow is mister son will give it a lovely detail yeah okay so this Bahama something yeah you know it's easy to forget his name because his legacy is now kind of like a brown dog to try to cross the interstate while the big rigs running fast and gets run over and it's not even like a shape what it did groundhog emerges kind of dark stained my way we're Obama's legacy used to be so it's easier to get a name look at this moment when it started to rain and Donna asked the Marines basically order the release commanders you holding umbrella over this head while you walk about the IRS tickler I am going to go ahead and ask folks want you when we get a couple of Marines they're going to look good next to us just because I I want to I've got to change it suits but I don't know about the R prime R prime minister there we go that's good I'm you guys I'm sorry about but but let me let me make sure that the I answer a specific question I can assure you that I certainly did not know anything about the IG report before the IG report had been leaked through press through the press so you're on video watch on Facebook were on the deal I don't know if you're just looking to necessarily arm extended outward its directly out holding the umbrella over Obama said more Obama lies that the teacher the IR s against conservatives okay so you looking to sell Qaeda something differently is not easy to hold your arm out like that for any extended period of time it's just it's just only different than attitude you know one one things about Trump that sometimes we have second is Teddy can be brought in say things about people when maybe you're unkind but part of it is because he actually conceives of himself as an ordinary person he doesn't see himself as better than that worried and that understands that that memory is a pretty gullible character serving the country and so when his hapless all Delta most powerful man in the entire world Stoops that brings it back it goes up again he chases after it and does it again I'm sorry but that says something really positive about the man just as it seems to me that Obama had been practicing to be king of America since he was a little kid and basically what it was Marines as a service you know it's just part of the vision the optics as they say now of this last week and the optics were the left was burning down Hamburg while Donald Trump made a beautiful beautiful speech defending Western civilization in Poland the left and reacted to this saying oh my gosh Western civilization is a dog whistle for racism as he's just being racist to Nazi Western civilization muscle talked about Western civilization when leftist activist and leader of the women's marches Linda Sarsour calls for jihad never he says Oh jihad jihad means you know we all know that this is a spiritual jihad you know so they they understand it's basically damning Western culture and celebrating jihad you know and meanwhile that you know it's very hard to tell what exactly happened in Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin but it seemed to be to go pretty well they got this Syrian ceasefire for as long as it lasts out of it there was some kind of controversy about the you know whether Trump but whether Trump conceded Putin basically said Putin's people basically said the Trump believe Putin when he denied meddling with the election that is not what Donald Trump says happened Trump apparently really gave it to Putin for a good 45 minutes over this question it really went on and on and he was really putting it to him later Trump sent out a kind of silly tweet saying then we're going to have some joint cybersecurity thing which is ridiculous we're not sharing I wouldn't share my my password with the Russians I have nothing on my computer that they want to see but Trump later said that's not going to happen it would be nice thing if it could but he can't so it just it just seemed that it was a basically a two hour meeting where they were exchanging the ideas and trying to come together and and then kind of Rex Tillerson sort of blew it a little bit he was describing it to reporters and he sort of put it that they were talking about Syria as if we were Russia and America were actual full allies listen we spent a very very lengthy period in home Syria with a great amount of detail exchanged on the agreement we had concluded today that was announced but also where we go and trying to get much greater clarity around how we see this playing out and how Russia sees are playing out and where do we share a common view and where do we have a difference and do we have the same objectives in mind and I will tell you that by and large our objectives are exactly decided how we get there we each have a view but there's a lot more commonality to that then there are differences so we want to build on the commonality and we spend a lot of time talking about next steps and then where others difference is we have more work to get together and understand maybe they've got the right approach and we've got the wrong approach so there was a substantial amount of time spent on Syria so we can cut Tillerson a break he's um he's trying to be diplomatic diplomat trying to be diplomatic but it's nonsense I mean the our objectives and the Russian objectives in Syria are completely different objects of the professions objectives are to build a lot of bases of Syria and keep their monster Assad in power and our objectives are of course or to make it a better country of people you know bring a little peace to the region and keep Russia's influence to a minimum so we do not have the same objectives John McCain with his usual restraint and you know good nature and quiet calm reacted to tiller son's comments do the Russians have the right hand make that up you can't thank that up these are the same people that use precision guided weapons to strike hospitals in Aleppo we're sick and wounded people are this is just you know I'm preparing myself mentally to be on the show I said John you're not going to get and how can I get emotional but I've met the white hats I know what the slaughter has been I know that the Russians knew that Bashar Assad was going to use chemical weapons and to say that maybe we've got the wrong approach look III agonized over voting for or against Tillerson for Secretary of State not that I didn't admire success and all the great things he's done but the things that he said in the past he has divorced a fundamental of American democracy the reason why we are though the shining city on the hill is Ronald Reagan used to say is because they look up to us because of our principles and our beliefs and our advocacy or freedom for freedom that's what America is supposed to be all about not whether they're right it will wrong oh no I actually agree with McCain here I mean I agree you know we have no connection to what the Russians are doing to people we have no Canadian we bombed them Trump bombed them in answer to the their use of Syria's use of chemical weapons that he shot down a plane that was bombing allies we shot down a plane that was bombing our allies in the field and the Russians threatened to retaliate and there are actions we have shown that we are still standing up for ourselves and for our principles what would it have cost McCain I wonder to just say you know the Tillerson isn't still a neophyte and he made a mistake here instead of basically accusing of burning down the American ideal and could make a drink John like cool it all right we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube which means you will not get to see this amazing set and at any moment one actually strands you know straggle out in front of the in front of the camera you never know what will happen but if you come over to the daily wire comm you can watch the whole thing there and while you're there subscribe it's allows you ten bucks a month if you do it for a year it's 100 bucks and you get the drink liberal tears mug so come on over ah
