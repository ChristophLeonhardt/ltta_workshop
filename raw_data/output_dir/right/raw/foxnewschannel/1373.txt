THE MID-2000s.

10
00:00:23,037 --> 00:00:25,005

TO SHARE IN THE PODCAST.

26
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:56,437
>> THE THING FOR ME BIGGEST

27
00:00:56,437 --> 00:00:59,540
PART OF SHARING MY STORY IS

28
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,411
THE RELATABILITY THAT ANYBODY

29
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:05,012
ELSE MIGHT HAVE.

30
00:01:05,012 --> 00:01:06,980
FOR ME, COMING OUT OF THE

31
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,549
MILITARY YOU COME HOME TO A

32
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,517
GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T

33
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:11,718
UNDERSTAND WHY YOU ARE BEEN

34
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:12,086
THERE.

35
00:01:12,086 --> 00:01:14,188
SO FOR ME TO SHARE THE

36
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:15,289
INTIMATE DETAILS OF THE

37
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:16,723
EXPERIENCES IS MY HOPE THAT

38
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:20,494
WHOEVER HEARS IT KNOWS THAT

39
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:22,129
THEY HAVE HOPE AND THEY ARE

40
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:24,098
NOT ALONE.

41
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:25,632
IN WHAT WAYS DO YOU FEEL IT

42
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:28,302
HAS BEEN THE MOST CHALLENGING

43
00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:30,304
FOR PEOPLE TO BE IT YOUR

44
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:31,605
FAMILY OR YOUR FRIENDS, THE

45
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:32,906
PEOPLE YOU SEE AT THE GROCERY

46
00:01:32,906 --> 00:01:39,580
STORE TO RELATE TO YOU POST

47
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,614
COMBAT?

48
00:01:40,614 --> 00:01:42,082
>> POST COMBAT, I KNOW

49
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:46,820
VETERANS WERE STUCK IN THE

50
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,322
MINDS.

51
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:49,923
WE WERE TRAINED TO DO THINGS A

52
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:52,092
CERTAIN WAY AND THEN TO ASK

53
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:54,828
FOR HELP IS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS

54
00:01:54,828 --> 00:01:55,629
WHEN YOU ARE ACTIVE.

55
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:57,030
SO WHEN YOU COME HOME YOU

56
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,332
ALMOST DON'T KNOW HOW TO

57
00:01:58,332 --> 00:01:59,366
VOCALIZE THAT WITH THE PEOPLE

58
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:00,534
YOU ARE CLOSE TO.

59
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:02,202
ESPECIALLY YOUR FAMILY AND

60
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:03,570
YOUR FRIENDS THAT YOU KNEW

61
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,004
BEFORE.

62
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:05,439
ESSENTIALLY TO THEM IT'S TWO

63
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:05,939
DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

64
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,541
THE PERSON THEY KNEW BEFORE

65
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,876
YOU DEPLOYED VERSUS THE PERSON

66
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:09,743
THAT COMES HOME.

67
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:12,079
>> Arthel: WELL, THERE IS

68
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:12,946
CERTAINLY NOTHING WEAK ABOUT

69
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:15,415
WHAT IT IS ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE

70
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:18,085
DONE AND CONTINUE TO DO.

71
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:20,287
HOW CHALLENGING IS IT TO CARE,

72
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:21,688
FOR YOU TO CARE FOR THE

73
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:23,223
RETURNING COMBAT VETS?

74
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:24,892
DO YOU ASSIST THEIR FAMILIES

75
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:26,960
AS WELL?

76
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,796
>> BASICALLY, I HAVE KEPT UP

77
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:32,332
AN OUTREACH WITH THE NUMEROUS

78
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:34,234
PEOPLE I SERVE WITH OR ANYONE

79
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:36,603
I MET AFTER THE SERVICE.

80
00:02:36,603 --> 00:02:37,738
THAT THE RET RANS.

81
00:02:37,738 --> 00:02:40,440
WE DIDN'T -- THAT THE VETERANS

82
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,375
AND THAT WE DIDN'T SERVE

83
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:41,742
TOGETHER.

84
00:02:41,742 --> 00:02:44,144
I MAKE IT A POINT TO LET THEM

85
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:45,045
KNOW THEY HAVE OPTIONS.

86
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:46,513
IT COULD BE A FRIEND.

87
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:47,080
SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF.

88
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,016
I WOULD BE THE FAMILY, THE

89
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:51,885
LOVED ONES THE SPOUSE.

90
00:02:51,885 --> 00:02:54,188
REACHING OUT TO THE V.A. IF

91
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:56,089
THEY HAVE THE BENEFITS AND

92
00:02:56,089 --> 00:03:00,761
GOING THAT ROUTE OR PRIVATE

93
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:01,895
CARE.

94
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:03,797
THE BIGGEST THREAT TO COME

95
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:05,599
HOME FROM OVERSEAS AND BEING

96
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,833
DEPLOYED IS KNOWING THEY HAVE

97
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,135
THINGS IN PLACE TO GO TO IF

98
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:09,570
THEY NEED IT.

99
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,505
>> Arthel: WHERE DO YOU FIND

100
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:13,607
YOUR PERSONAL STRENGTH?

101
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:15,242
>> I THINK I FOUND MY PERSONAL

102
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:20,147
STRENGTH IN MY FAMILY,

103
00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:21,014
ESPECIALLY.

104
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:22,849
THE PEOPLE THAT STOOD BY ME

105
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:24,151
SINCE I HAVE COME HOME.

106
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:26,253
WITH MY VETERAN FAMILY IT'S

107
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:27,454
NICE TO KNOW YOU CAN PICK UP

108
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:28,889
THE PHONE SIX YEARS AFTER NOT

109
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,357
SEEING SOMEBODY AND SAY HEY,

110
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:33,327

00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:38,932
