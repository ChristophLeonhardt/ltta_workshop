1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,900
Throw them out!

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,860
Enough is enough!

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,520
Anti-gun activists in the U.S. have been pushing for gun law reform.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,480
Australia, having made substantial changes
to its gun laws, is often held as an example.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,680
The country has a very low rate of gun-related homicide when compared to the U.S.,

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,640
where people are at least 20 times more likely to
be murdered by firearms.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,360
Stricter gun controls can’t stop every mass shooting, but they have made Australia a significantly safer place.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,000
Here’s how.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,499
Australia used to have a serious problem with
gun violence.

10
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:44,870
Researchers define mass shootings as five
or more deaths, not including the perpetrator.

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,220
From 1979 to 1996 there were 13 mass shootings,

12
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,840
resulting in over 100 deaths and more than 50 injuries.

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,120
However, due to the gun lobby and politicians
sympathetic to their firearm-owning voters

14
00:00:58,129 --> 00:00:59,559
little was done to stop gun deaths.

15
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:07,680
If being a politician and living in that bloody
house is the most important thing to them,

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,380
then they’re not worth it.

17
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,500
In April 1996 that all changed.

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,040
On the island of Tasmania, the worst massacre
in Australia’s history is finally over.

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,100
At least 34 people were killed, and four others
critically wounded.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:28,330
Armed with two rifles - an AR-15 and a .308
FN - Martin Bryant made his way through

21
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,460
Port Arthur historic site killing 35 people and
injuring a further 23.

22
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:39,380
Both guns were semi-automatic, rapid-fire
weapons and both were legal in the state of Tasmania.

23
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,500
At the time, the Port Arthur massacre was
the worst single-person mass shooting in global history.

24
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,240
It utterly shocked Australians and reignited
public outrage .

25
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,610
Just 12 days later, the then Prime Minister
John Howard pushed through a sweeping set

26
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,960
of gun regulations, despite a lack of support
from his rural constituency.

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,780
I’m sorry about that, but there is no other
way.

28
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,520
There is no other way.

29
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,260
Within a month, the government passed the
National Firearms Agreement,

30
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,039
transforming gun legislation in the country.

31
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,780
Before the Port Arthur massacre gun laws varied
from state to state.

32
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,940
What the agreement did was standardize the laws nationally.

33
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,640
Certain semi-automatics and self-loading rifles
and shotguns were banned.

34
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,700
New licensing requirements were adopted and
a national firearms registry was established.

35
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,420
The law says Australians need a “genuine
reason” for having a firearm,

36
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,600
such as sport shooting or for agricultural use.

37
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,750
It doesn’t include self-defense.

38
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,760
People must go through background checks and
wait 28 days before they can buy a gun.

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,520
The government also spent $375 million ,
to buy back 640,000 civilian-owned guns

40
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,380
and then destroyed them.

41
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,560
After the gun law reform, the total number
of homicides involving a firearm decreased by half.

42
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,920
The total number of gun-related deaths fell
rapidly as well,

43
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,880
dropping more than half in 2016 compared with 1996.

44
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,500
Australia didn’t see a single mass shooting
from 1996 to 2018, more than 22 years.

45
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,020
However, anti-gun activists warned that following
years of lobbying by pro-gun groups,

46
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,720
Australia’s strict gun laws have been eroded.

47
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,890
And gun numbers are almost back to the same
level as at the time of the Port Arthur massacre.

48
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,950
In May 2018, a family of seven - including
four children - were shot dead in an apparent

49
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,000
murder-suicide in the state of Western Australia.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,620
It’s brought back painful memories and uncertainty
about the issue many thought had been resolved.

51
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,140
Australia is not totally immune to mass shootings,

52
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,260
but its response to the Port Arthur massacre
demonstrated how strong political leadership

53
00:03:46,260 --> 00:00:00,000
and strict gun control policies can help curb
violence and save lives.
