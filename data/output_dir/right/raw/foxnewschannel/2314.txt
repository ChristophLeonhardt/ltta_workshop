1
00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:02,498
WOMEN, FEMALE, UNEMPLOYMENT,

2
00:00:02,498 --> 00:00:07,437
LOWEST LEVEL IN 18 YEARS.

3
00:00:07,437 --> 00:00:11,474
JESSE: JOINING ME NOW

4
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:14,510
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,745
TURNING POINT U.S.A. AND NEW

6
00:00:15,745 --> 00:00:19,782
STAR IN AMERICA CANDACE OWENS.

7
00:00:19,782 --> 00:00:21,751
HE SPOKE ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT

8
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:23,219
BEING AT RECORD LOW AND TALKED

9
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:26,422
ABOUT HIS NEW FRIEND KANYE WEST.

10
00:00:26,422 --> 00:00:28,491
DO YOU THINK KANYE IS THROWING

11
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:29,759
HIS SUPPORT BEHIND PRESIDENT

12
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,794
TRUMP BECAUSE OF HIS ECONOMIC

13
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:33,596
POLICIES FOR BLACK AMERICA?

14
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:34,564
>> FOR SURE.

15
00:00:34,564 --> 00:00:37,033
I THINK WHAT KANYE WEST IS DOING

16
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:39,535
IS ASSESSING THE CONTINUES

17
00:00:39,535 --> 00:00:41,204
BETWEEN HOW BLACK AMERICA IS

18
00:00:41,204 --> 00:00:43,206
DOING NOW VERSUS HOW IT WAS

19
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:44,440
DOING UNDER OBAMA'S

20
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:44,907
ADMINISTRATION.

21
00:00:44,907 --> 00:00:47,310
WE KNOW THAT KANYE HAS

22
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,412
PARTICULARLY CARED A LOT ABOUT

23
00:00:49,412 --> 00:00:51,948
CHICAGO AND ITS COMMUNITY AND

24
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:54,450
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON OVER THERE

25
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,785
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE HE'S FROM.

26
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:57,920
THEY ARE DOING BETTER UNDER THIS

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,454
ADMINISTRATION.

28
00:00:58,454 --> 00:01:00,590
SO I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHERE

29
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,458
BLACK AMERICA IS GOING TO HEAD

30
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,994
AND EXCITED THAT KANYE WEST

31
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:06,996
JUMPED ON BOARD FULLY AND HE

32
00:01:06,996 --> 00:01:08,564
SEEMS TO BE DOUBLE DOWN AND

33
00:01:08,564 --> 00:01:10,967
TRIPLING DOWN WITH HIS SUPPORT.

34
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:15,905
JESSE: BLACK AMERICA, 90% VOTES

35
00:01:15,905 --> 00:01:17,106
DEMOCRATS.

36
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:21,344
WHITES ARE EVENLY SPLIT.

37
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:23,479
ASIANS 60-30.

38
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:25,715
WHY DO YOU THINK AS A BLACK

39
00:01:25,715 --> 00:01:27,617
WOMAN IN AMERICA THAT THERE IS

40
00:01:27,617 --> 00:01:30,386
UP A MONOLITHIC GROUP THAT

41
00:01:30,386 --> 00:01:32,288
SUPPORTS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN

42
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:32,622
AMERICA.

43
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:34,223
>> IT'S SIMPLE.

44
00:01:34,223 --> 00:01:36,425
I COME FROM THE LEFT I WAS A

45
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:36,893
LIBERAL.

46
00:01:36,893 --> 00:01:39,662
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE

47
00:01:39,662 --> 00:01:40,329
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.

48
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:43,399
WE LEARN THAT LBJ WAS THE

49
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:44,867
GREATEST PRESIDENT FOR BLACK

50
00:01:44,867 --> 00:01:46,235
AMERICA AND THAT COULDN'T BE

51
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:47,236
MORE FALSE.

52
00:01:47,236 --> 00:01:49,639
WHAT HE DID IS EVEN SLAVE US

53
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:52,842
WITH THE GREAT SO -- WHAT HE DID

54
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:56,979
WAS ENSLAVE US WITH THE GREAT

55
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,649
SOCIETY.

56
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:02,018
OUR FATHERS ARE NOT IN OUR HOMES

57
00:02:02,018 --> 00:02:04,420
BECAUSE THAT WAS I SEASON

58
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,192
TOUGHIZED BY LBJ'S GREAT SOCIETY

59
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:10,626
ACT.

60
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:12,862
THEY HAVE ALL OF US VOTING FOR

61
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:14,931
THEM FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS.

62
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:16,399
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND OUR HISTORY

63
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:18,568
AND DON'T UNDERSTAND THE

64
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:19,802
ECONOMIC POLICIES BEHIND IT.

65
00:02:19,802 --> 00:02:22,271
JESSE: YOU THINK THE EDUCATION

66
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:24,740
SYSTEM IN OUR COUNTRY TEACHES

67
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,043
AMERICA THAT THE BIG GOVERNMENT

68
00:02:27,043 --> 00:02:29,412
POLICIES STARTED UNDER LBJ ARE

69
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:31,681
GOOD FOR THEM, BUT YOU ARE

70
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:34,083
SAYING THOSE GOVERNMENT POLICIES

71
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,919
HAVE MAYBE STIFLED THE GROWTH OF

72
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,820
BLACK AMERICA.

73
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,289
>> IT'S NOT A MATTER OF OPINION.

74
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:41,724
IT'S A MATTER OF FACT.

75
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:43,526
I CAME UP IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL

76
00:02:43,526 --> 00:02:45,127
EDUCATION.

77
00:02:45,127 --> 00:02:48,130
WE ALSO LEARNED, THE REPUBLICAN

78
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,034
PARTY IS VIRTUALLY DEMONIZED IN

79
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:53,269
OUR TEXTBOOKS.

80
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,371
MOST OF BLACKS BELIEVE THE

81
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:57,807
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC

82
00:02:57,807 --> 00:03:00,776
PARTIES SWITCHED IN THE 1970s

83
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:01,644
SWITCHED.

84
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:03,045
THAT'S A MYTH.

85
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:04,714
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

86
00:03:04,714 --> 00:03:05,815
SOMETHING CALLED THE SOUTHERN

87
00:03:05,815 --> 00:03:06,249
STRATEGY.

88
00:03:06,249 --> 00:03:08,651
THEY ARE LEARNING TO BE IGNORANT

89
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:10,887
IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND ONCE

90
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:13,756
AGAIN AT HOME VIA CULTURE.

91
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:16,192
THEY ARE IDOLIZING PEOPLE WHO

92
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:18,661
ARE NOT TELLING THEM ACCURATELY

93
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:20,229
WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR

94
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,596
COUNTRIES.

95
00:03:20,596 --> 00:03:22,932
JESSE: I KNOW WHEN I HIT THE

96
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:28,104
STREETS AND YOU ASK PEOPLE IF

97
00:03:28,104 --> 00:00:00,000
ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS A REPUBLICAN
