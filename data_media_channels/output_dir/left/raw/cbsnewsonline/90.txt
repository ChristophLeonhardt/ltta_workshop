369
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:51,596
THINK ABOUT IT, LIBERATING 

370
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:53,098
TOWNS WHERE YOU WOULD WALK DOWN

WE'RE GETTING THEM OUT. 

378
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,214

00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:09,447
TOWNS. 

380
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:11,517
IT HITS HOME WHEN YOU GREW UP

00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:11,750
THERE. 

382
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,885
THAT'S WHERE IT REALLY HITS 

383
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,287
WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE 

384
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:15,654
IT'S HAPPENING. 

385
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,424

413
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,997
>>> TODAY I SENT A LETTER TO 

414
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,799
STATE AND LOCAL LEADERS ACROSS

00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,068
OUR NATION ASKING THEM TO

00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:36,702

00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:43,942
AND CBC. 

420
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:46,879
SADLY, IN RECENT MONTHS 

421
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,782
INCREDIBLY, I HAVE TO SAY, 

422
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,750
INCREDIBLY, A COALITION OF OPEN 

423
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,318
BORDERS, EXTREMISTS AND TO ME 

424
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:54,787
THAT MEANS CRIME, PEOPLE THAT 

425
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,187
DON'T MIND CRIME. 

426
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,122
THEY MIND IT WHEN IT HAPPENS TO 

427
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:57,322
THEM. 

428
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:59,191
THEY DON'T MIND IT WHEN THEY 

429
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:03,528
HAVE TO WATCH IT ON TELEVISION. 

430
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:04,863
HAVE WAGED AN UNPRECEDENTED 

431
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,066
ASSAULT ON AMERICAN LAW 

432
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,333

COUNTRY FROM HORRIBLE PEOPLE, 

438
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,346
AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE EVENTS 

439
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:20,646
AND CRIMES. 

440
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,083
IN MAJOR CITIES ACROSS THE 

441
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,050
NATION, THESE OPEN BORDER 

442
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,420
RADICALS HAVE BLOCKED ACCESS TO 

443
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:28,687
I.C.E. 

444
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,956
BUILDINGS, TO FACE PUBLIC 

445
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,624
PROPERTY AND THREATENED PUBLIC 

446
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:32,857
SAFETY. 

447
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:35,327
AND WHAT YOU HEAR IN THE 

448
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,196
NEWSPAPERS AND ON THE NEWS IS 

449
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,799
NOTHING COMPARED TO THE WAY IT 

450
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,933
REALLY IS. 

451
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:43,435
AND WE'RE STOPPING IT VERY VERY 

452
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:43,702
STRONGLY. 

453
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:48,440
BUT THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH 

454
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,476
WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH AND 

455
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:54,580
HAVING TO BE DEMEANED BY PEOPLE 

456
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,514
THAT HAVE NO IDEA WHAT STRENGTH 

457
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,882
IS REALLY VERY SAD, AND WE 

458
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,650
FIGHT IT VERY HARD, AND I CAN 

459
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,119
TELL YOU ALL OF THESE PEOPLE 

460
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,554
RIGHT HERE, AND ALL OF THE 

461
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,356
PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, WE WILL

00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:08,260
NEVER LET YOU DOWN, AND I WILL 

463
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,561
ALSO SAY, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 

464
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:13,265
THE VAST MAJORITY, I DON'T MEAN 

465
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:13,665
LIKE 51%. 

466
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,666
I MEAN LIKE 88%, 93%, I HAVE 

467
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,403
SEEN NUMBERS, THEY'RE ALL WITH 

468
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:17,603
YOU. 

469
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,104
IT'S JUST A SMALL GROUP THAT 

470
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,372
GETS A LOT OF PUBLICITY, 

471
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,075
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO COURAGE, 

472
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:26,178
THEY HAVE NO GUTS, THEY JUST 

473
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,779
HAVE BIG, LOUD MOUTHS. 

474
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:31,016
AND WE DON'T WANT TO PUT UP 

475
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:31,350
WITH NAY. 

476
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,784
AND I -- UP WITH THAT. 

477
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:34,887
AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW, 

478
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,256
YOU'RE LOVED AND RESPECTED AS 

479
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,791
MUCH AS ANYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY 

480
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,992
IS RESPECTED. 

481
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:48,500
LAST MONTH, THE MAYOR OF 

482
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,235
PORTLAND, OREGON,  ORDERED 

483
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,971
LOCAL POLICE TO STAND DOWN. 

484
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,407
LEADING MEMBERS OF THE DEMOCRAT 

485
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,808
PARTY HAVE EVEN LAUNCHED A 

486
00:17:56,808 --> 00:17:59,911
CAMPAIGN TO ABOLISH I.C.E. 

487
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:03,282
IN OTHER WORDS, THEY WANT TO 

488
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:03,849
ABOLISH AMERICA'S BORDERS. 

489
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,251
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT I'M 

490
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,953
WORKING ON IT ALL THE TIME, 

491
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,555
THEY COME IN, WE'RE PROTECTING 

492
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,423
BORDERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT 

493
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,125
WE DON'T PROTECT OUR OWN 

494
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:13,392
BORDERS. 

495
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:13,925
HOW ABOUT THAT. 

496
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:15,527
SPENDING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS 

497
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,695
OF DOLLARS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, 

498
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,497
IN SOME CASES, PLACES WE 

499
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,932
SHOULDN'T BE, TO PROTECT THEIR 

500
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:24,470
BORDERS, BUT WE DON'T PROTECT 

501
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,270
OUR OWN BORDER. 

502
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:30,008
WE CONDEMN THE SHAMEFUL ATTACKS 

503
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,610
ON OUR GREAT LAW ENFORCEMENT. 

504
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,644
ANY POLITICIAN WHO PUTS 

505
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:33,712
CRIMINAL ALIENS BEFORE AMERICAN 

506
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,380
CITIZENS SHOULD FIND A NEW LINE 

507
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:35,680
OF WORK. 

508
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:41,153
BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK. 

509
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:41,986
NOT GOING TO WORK. 

510
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:46,558
AND ANY POLITICIANS THAT GET UP 

511
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,927
AND SAY THAT OUR COUNTRY WAS 

512
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:54,800
NEVER GREAT, YOU HEARD THAT, I 

513
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,235
THINK THAT'S THE END OF THAT 

514
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:56,368
CAREER. 

515
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,109
CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS HAVE 

516
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,078
OPPOSED KATE'S LAW. 

517
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:09,248
OPPOSED LEGISLATION TO CRACK 

518
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:09,948
DOWN ON MS13 THUGS. 

519
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,483
AND SUPPORTED DEADLY SANCTUARY 

520
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,118
CITIES, WHICH ARE A DISASTER 

521
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,454
AND WHICH ARE BECOMING ON A 

522
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:19,458
WEEKLY BASIS MORE AND MORE 

523
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,158
UNPOPULAR WITH THE PUBLIC. 

524
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:24,062
A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST 

525
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:24,362
TWO YEARS. 

526
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:25,664
LAST MONTH HOUSE DEMOCRATS, 

527
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,900
EVEN BOYCOTTED A RESOLUTION 

528
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,901
SUPPORTING OUR BRAVE I.C.E. 

529
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:30,802
OFFICERS AND AGENTS. 

530
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,338
BUT I WILL SAY THIS, THE 

531
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:40,212
REPUBLICANS WERE WITH YOU ALL 

532
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,480
THE WAY. 

533
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:42,981
ALL THE WAY. 

534
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,717
AND WE WON. 

535
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,220
WE ACTUALLY WON. 

536
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,389
THIS NEW WAVE OF ANTI-BORDERS, 

537
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,056
ANTI-LAW ENFORCEMENT EXTREMISM 

538
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,357
AND SHAMEFUL, DANGEROUS, 

539
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,326
HORRIBLE IN EVERY WAY, AND IT'S 

540
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,093
GOING TO STOP. 

541
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,496
IT'S GOING TO STOP RIGHT NOW. 

542
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,164
IT'S GOING TO STOP TODAY. 

543
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,866
WE LOAD IT DOWN. 

544
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,566
NOW WE'RE STOPPING IT. 

545
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:04,703
WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER OUR 

546
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:11,476
NATION TO THE FORCES OF AN AIR 

547
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,346
KEY AND CHAOS -- ANARCHY, AND 

548
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:14,613
CRIME. 

549
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,448
THE POISONS ARE FLOWING ACROSS 

550
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:20,986
OUR BORDER, AND WE'RE HITTING 

551
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,321
IT FROM EVERY ANGLE. 

552
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,822
BUT WE NEED NEW LAWS. 

553
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:24,823
WE NEED BORDER LAWS. 

554
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:25,791
WE NEED IMMIGRATION LAWS. 

555
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,892
WE NEED THEM FAST. 

556
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,627
WE'RE GOING TO GET THEM. 

557
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:29,661
HOPEFULLY THE MIDTERMS WILL 

558
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,662
HELP TOWARD THAT END. 

559
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,997
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO VERY 

560
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,865
WELL IN THE MIDTERMS AND THIS 

561
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:36,735
IS ONE OF THE VERY BIG REASONS, 

562
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,870
THE FACT IS PEOPLE RESPECT LAW 

563
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,339
AND ORDER, AND THEY LOVE OUR 

564
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,140
LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND I THINK 

565
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,543
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE 

566
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:47,045
OF A RED WAVE THAN WHAT YOU'RE 

567
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:51,483
GOING TO SEE AS A PHONY BLUE 

568
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:51,683
WAVE. 

569
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:52,451
BLUE WAVE MEANS CRIME. 

570
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,186
IT MEANS OPEN BORDERS. 

571
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:54,453
NOT GOOD. 

572
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:57,789
WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THE VILE 

573
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:58,422
SMEARS, THE HATEFUL ATTACKS, 

574
00:20:58,422 --> 00:21:00,892
AND THE VICIOUS ASSAULTS ON THE 

575
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,661
COURAGEOUS MEN AND WOMEN OF 

576
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,496
I.C.E., AND BORDER AND PATROL, 

577
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,763
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. 

578
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:08,467
WE WILL PROTECT THOSE WHO 

579
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,100
PROTECT US. 

580
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,037
THE EXTREMISTS WHO ATTACK 

581
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:12,270
I.C.E. 

582
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,207
AND CBS, LIKE TO PORTRAY 

583
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,442
THEMSELVES AS CHAMPIONS OF 

584
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,745
SOCIAL INJUSTICE, THEY ARE NOT. 

585
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:23,448
BUT THEIR RADICAL POLICIES ARE 

586
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,583
THE ULTIMATE INJUSTICE HURTING 

587
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,052
INNOCENT AMERICANS AND SPILLING 

588
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,420
INNOCENT BLOOD. 

589
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,555
PEOPLE ARE DYING BECAUSE OF 

590
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,825
THEIR EITHER LACK OF KNOWLEDGE, 

591
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:37,963
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OR JUST 

592
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,398
PLAIN STUPIDITY. 

593
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,199
LAST YEAR ALONE, SANCTUARY 

594
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:41,699
JURISDICTIONS AND LOCAL 

595
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:42,734
COMMUNITIES UNLEASHED NEARLY 

596
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,537
8000 CRIMINAL ALIENS ONTO TOUR 

597
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:46,271
STREETS. 

598
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,038
OUR LAWS ARE NO GOOD. 

599
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:48,106
OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS ARE 

600
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:48,373
BROKEN. 

601
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,842
THEY HAVE BEEN BROKEN FOR MANY 

602
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,310
YEARS. 

603
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,712
AND THE WORLD IS LAUGHING AT 

604
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:53,979
US. 

605
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,515
THE WORLD IS LAUGHING AT THE 

606
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:59,551
STUPIDITY OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE 

607
00:21:59,551 --> 00:21:59,951
WITH IMMIGRATION. 

608
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,453
BUT WE'RE GETTING IT CHANGED 

609
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,155
AND IT'S ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE 

610
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,824
MUCH MORE SO AND MUCH QUICKER, 

611
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,292
I THINK, THAN ANYBODY 

612
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,460
UNDERSTANDS BECAUSE PEOPLE 

613
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,395
REALLY NOW UNDERSTAND THE 

614
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,464
PROBLEM. 

615
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:16,101
WE'RE PUSHING VERY VERY HARD. 

616
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,670
IN CALIFORNIA, SANCTUARY 

617
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,438
POLICIES RELEASED A DOMESTIC 

618
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:19,771
ABUSER. 

619
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,206
HE IS A SUSPECTED KILLER. 

620
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:25,944
THEY THINK HE KILLED HIS 

621
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,714
GIRLFRIEND JUST TWO WEEKS AFTER 

622
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:30,047
HIS RELEASE. 

623
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:30,782
IT WILL BE DETERMINED VERY 

624
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,517
SHORTLY, AND I HAVE A FEELING 

625
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,686
YOU ALL KNOW THE ANSWER. 

626
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,854
IN THE SANCTUARY CITY OF 

627
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,521
PHILADELPHIA, LOCAL OFFICIALS 

628
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,756
REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH 

629
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:38,089
I.C.E. 

630
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:39,558
WE HAVE A LOT OF I.C.E. 

631
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,759
PEOPLE HERE THAT KNOW EXACTLY 

632
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,894
WHAT HAPPENED THERE, AND THEY 

633
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,362
RELEASED A PREVIOUSLY DEPORTED 

634
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:47,399
ILLEGAL ALIEN BACK ONTO THE 

635
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,201
STREETS AFTER HIS RELEASE. 

636
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:52,604
THE ILLEGAL ALIEN RAPED AND 

637
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:53,405
BATTERED A CHILD. 

638
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,573
IN RECENT WEEKS, AN ELDERLY 

639
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,641
HOMELESS WOMAN IN NEW YORK CITY 

640
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,978
WAS ALLEGEDLY BEATEN TO DEATH 

641
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,380
BY A TWICE DEPORTED ILLEGAL 

642
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:02,613
ALIEN. 

643
00:23:02,613 --> 00:23:06,385
TWO WOMEN IN OREGON WERE 

644
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,486
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY AN 

645
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,354
ILLEGAL ALIEN PREVIOUSLY 

646
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:09,921
DEPORTED 20 TIMES. 

647
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,490
DID YOU HEAR THAT, 20 TIMES. 

648
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,960
THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. 

649
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,994
THE TRUE CHAMPIONS OF JUSTICE 

650
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:19,531
ARE RIGHT HERE IN THIS ROOM. 

651
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,968
AND THEY'RE PROUDLY WEARING THE 

652
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,102
BADGE OF AMERICAN LAW 

653
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:24,435
ENFORCEMENT. 

654
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:26,505
MY PLEDGE TO EACH AND EVERY ONE 

655
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,073
OF YOU IS THAT MY 

656
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,976
ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT REST 

657
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,244
UNTIL YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES, 

658
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:33,878
THE TOOLS, AND THE AUTHORITIES 

659
00:23:33,878 --> 00:23:36,515
YOU NEED TO DO YOUR JOB AND DO 

660
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,951
IT PROPERLY AND DO IT STRONG. 

661
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:40,519
YOU'RE SAVING LIVES. 

662
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:44,389
YOU'RE SAVING A LOT OF 

663
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:44,689
AMERICANS. 

664
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,992
WE WILL STOP SANCTUARY CITIES. 

665
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:49,494
WE WILL END THE RIDICULOUS 

666
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:50,462
POLICY OF CATCH AND RELEASE. 

667
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,712
THINK ABOUT THIS, YOU CATCH 

668
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,948
SOMEBODY, BAD, YOU TAKE THEIR 

669
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,615
NAME AND RELEASE THEM. 

670
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,517
EXCEPT FOR POLITICS, THE 

671
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,720
DEMOCRATS ALL KNOW IT'S WRONG. 

672
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,857
BUT POLITICS IS ABSOLUTELY 

673
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:19,858
PARAMOUNT OVER LAW ENFORCEMENT 

674
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,192
SAFETY, CRIME, WE HAVE TO GET 

675
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:23,962
PEOPLE IN THAT ARE GOING TO DO 

676
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:24,329
WHAT'S PROPER. 

677
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:24,863
I'LL DO WHAT'S PROPER. 

678
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,431
I WOULD VOTE THE OTHER WAY IF I 

679
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,633
THOUGHT IT WAS THE PROPER THING 

680
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,100
TO DO. 

681
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,202
I DON'T HAVE PARTY LINES. 

682
00:24:31,202 --> 00:24:33,605
WE WILL PASS AT SOME POINT 

683
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,541
HOPEFULLY IN THE NOT TOO 

684
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,743
DISTANT FUTURE, KATE'S LAW. 

685
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:41,646
IT'S A GREAT LAW, AND IT'S 

686
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,516
SITTING WAITING FOR A VOTE. 

687
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:48,420
WE WILL DESTROY MS13, AND WE 

688
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,188
WILL SECURE OUR BORDER ONCE AND 

689
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:50,354
FOR ALL. 

690
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:57,896

692
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:00,665

AND YOU ARE THE WARRIORS FOR

00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:24,422
I'M HONORED EVERY SINGLE DAY TO

POINT OUT THAT ESPECIALLY IN 

734
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,577

740
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,322
HE MADE A POINT OF PEOPLE

00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:40,465
QUOTE ABOLISH AMERICA'S VOTERS. 

744
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,702
IT IS WORTH REMINDING VIEWERS, 

745
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:44,636
BOTH I.C.E. 

746
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,705

747
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:47,772

ROOTS OUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 

751
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,181
INTERNALLY, AND THE CALLS ARE 

752
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,083
NOT CALLS TO ABOLISH BORDER 

753
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:58,616
PATROL. 

754
00:26:58,616 --> 00:26:59,517
THOSE ARE TWO DISTINCT 

755
00:26:59,517 --> 00:26:59,884

756
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:00,417

HE CALLED THOSE ARRESTS 

761
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,260

762
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:09,660

THE PRESIDENT ALSO MENTIONED 

764
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:12,630

TRAFFICKING AND CHILD 

766
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:15,533
EXPLOITATION VICTIMS. 

767
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:17,335
HE SAYS I.C.E. 

768
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:18,602

BROKEN, AND HE CALLED FOR A RED 

773
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,878
WAVER AT MIDTERMS, NOT A BLUE 

774
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:30,849
WAVE WHICH THE PRESIDENT SAYS 

775
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,317
WOULD STAND FOR CRIME AND OPEN 

776
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:32,483
BORDERS. 

777
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,187
