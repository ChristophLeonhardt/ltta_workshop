Michael Wolf's book fire in fury includes a portion that was recently tweeted about by Katie tore on MSNBC it had to do with how far Donald Trump was willing to go to bed his friends wives and he actually used according to Michael Wolf's account his secretary in order to make these sexual rendezvous come to fruition so according to the book Trump liked to say that one of the things that made life worth living was getting your friends wives into bed let's just pause there to just soak in what a terrible human being is I mean a lot of his defenders will go I mean he's just a broke man he's just doing locker room talk no no it's not just talk and if you knew him he'd try to sleep with your wife and I if you're into that okay I know that I know there's a word for that right it's a legitimate fetish like yeah like some guys like to be cooks like that that's really what they want to do and do you do you and I remember when he pulled the guy onstage once during the campaign and then he said Oh your wife is hot maybe she'd prefer and he was dressed like Donald Trump the the fan was and he's like maybe she'd like the real deal instead and and so but look he was your fan so and I know some of the Magra goes like okay but if he was your friend he would also try to sleep with your wife and now now if you think that's no big deal first of all you're a weird weird person right right I mean that's isn't that the biggest bro rule there is that that don't mess with each other's girlfriends and wives I don't think we know any of the bro rules to be fine but here's the thing okay it's it's one thing if Trump was like this suave sexy cool guy and then wives ended up cheating on their husbands because they were so attracted to Trump but that's not what was happening he was a conniving sneaky terrible little shit that did horrible things in order to you know convince the wives to sleep with him so let me give you the details on that okay so in pursuing a friend's wife he would try to persuade the wife that her husband was perhaps not what she thought then he his secretary asked a friend into his office once the friend arrived Trump would engage in what was for him more or less constant sexual banter so for example he would say to the husband in the room okay you must you must have had a better expletive than your wife tell me about it I have girls coming in from Los Angeles at 3 o'clock we can go upstairs and have a great time I promise by the way all the while Trump would have his friend's wife on the speakerphone listening in on their conversation oh he's such a bad guy Wow can you imagine if someone in your personal life did that I mean if a co-worker did that to you how much would you hate them but if it turned out it was one of your best friends who try to ambush you like that so not only so that your wife would hate you and divorce you but so that he could have sex with your wife I mean that is on a scale 1 to 10 of bad that's an 11 that's a hundred and ten Wow I feel like a lot of his behavior is it stems from insecurity right and look everything that he says everything that he does reeks of insecurity it's about proving that he can get the women proving that he is attractive proving that he has you know a decent sized you know area down there but exactly like everything he does stems from insecurity like he is the ultimate example of daddy issues right because his dad was constantly disappointed in him and I know that that's tough on men that's tough on people in general right and I feel like his entire life has been about proving to everyone that he's great that he's smart that he's attractive that he's rich that he's this that he's that and and trying to sleep with the wives for me like I don't I don't think that he's like some crazed sex maniac I think it was about proving to himself that he can get the wives to cheat on their husbands and sleep with him I just look of all the revelations in the book and all the things we've covered in all these years are the things that are worse for the country of course right there's policies that he's done that are despicable and gutting the environment being against all those different racial groups two genders then there's the the you know perhaps working with Putin which is you get to find out more about in this book but in terms of who he is his moral character whether you're in the left wing the right wing the mitt or the middle it doesn't matter and you look at that story and it just doesn't get any worse than that right if you see that story and you still think he's a good guy there's something really really wrong with you if you liked this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through Friday come enjoy ad-free by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
