I am here today not
because I want to be.
I am terrified.
I am here because I
believe it is my civic duty
to tell you what happened
to me while Brett Kavanaugh
and I were in high school.
I was pushed onto the bed
and Brett got on top of me.
He began running his
hands over my body
and grinding into me.
I yelled, hoping that someone
downstairs might hear me.
And I tried to
get away from him,
but his weight was heavy.
Brett groped me and tried
to take off my clothes.
He had a hard time because
he was very inebriated
and because I was wearing
a one-piece bathing suit
underneath my clothing.
I believed he was
going to rape me.
I tried to yell for help.
When I did, Brett put
his hand over my mouth
to stop me from yelling.
This is what
terrified me the most
and has had the most
lasting impact on my life.
It was hard for me to breathe,
and I thought that
Brett was accidentally
going to kill me.
Both Brett and Mark
were drunkenly laughing
during the attack.
They seemed to be
having a very good time.
Mark seemed ambivalent,
at times urging Brett on,
and at times
telling him to stop.
A couple of times,
I made eye contact with Mark
and thought he
might try to help me.
But he did not.
During this assault,
Mark came over and
jumped on the bed twice
while Brett was on top of me.
Then the last time that he
did this, we toppled over
and Brett was no longer
on top of me.
I was able to get up
and run out of the room.
Directly across
from the bedroom
was a small bathroom.
I ran inside the bathroom
and locked the door.
I waited until I heard
Brett and Mark leave
the bedroom laughing
and loudly walk down
the narrow stairway,
pinballing off the walls
on the way down.
I waited, and when I did
not hear them come back
up the stairs, I left
the bathroom, went down
the same stairwell
through the living room
and left the house.
I remember being on
the street and feeling
this enormous sense of relief
that I had escaped that house
and that Brett and Mark were
not coming outside after me.
Brettâ€™s assault on me
drastically altered my life.
