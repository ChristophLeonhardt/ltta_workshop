“Give me your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses yearning
to breathe free” is
just a poem on a statue.
When it comes to
protecting America
from undocumented immigrants
and asylum seekers,
the government is
finally stepping up.
This isn’t the first time
we’ve detained thousands of people
we’re afraid of.
During World War II, we protected our country
by forcing Japanese-Americans
into internment camps.
We even made this
handy propaganda film
to make us all
feel fine about it.
The uncertainty of
what would happen
among these people in case
of a Japanese invasion
still remained.
That is why all Japanese
within the coastal areas
should move inland.
We are protecting
ourselves without violating
the principles of
Christian decency.
In Romans 13:
“To obey the laws
of the government
because God has
ordained the government.”
History won’t repeat
itself on its own.
It takes good old-fashioned
elbow grease.
Whether it’s immigration
or the travel ban,
we’ve got your back.
Newly arrived immigrants
full of potential
come to the border
looking for safety
and to pursue their
American dream.
Little do they know that
dream is dead.
Now, zero tolerance
doesn’t mean zero fun.
We first launched our program
with special tender-age
centers.
Sorry, parents.
This is a kids-only zone.
They receive three
square meals a day,
shiny blankets and trauma
they can keep for the
rest of their lives.
We give them meals, we give them education.
We give them medical care.
There’s videos.
There’s TVs.
The Army provided
housing, plenty
of healthful, nourishing
food for all.
The residents of the new community set
about developing a way of life
as nearly normal as possible.
We know this
probably looks crazy.
But don’t worry,
the administration
knows exactly what
they’re doing.
No more free passes,
no more get-out-of-jail-
free cards, no
more lawlessness.
I hate the children
being taken away.
The Democrats have to change
their law, that’s their law.
We would like to
fix these loopholes.
And if Democrats want
to get serious about it
instead of playing
political games —
They can’t do it through
an executive order.
Thank you, sir, for
your leadership.
Thank you very much.
Great job.
O.K.
You‘re going to have a lot
of happy people.
Naturally, the newcomers looked
about with some curiosity.
They were in a new area,
on land that was raw,
untamed, but full of opportunity.
Here they would build schools,
educate their children,
reclaim the desert.
More than 2,300 children were
separated from their parents
since April, with no imminent
plans to reunite them.
But after the president’s executive order,
families will
be detained together.
And it’s all being done
in the name of deterrence.
Another way of saying,
scaring the  out
of immigrants who
are already scared
so  they’ve left
everything behind and risked
their life.
Now, deterrence isn’t
a long-term solution.
But it sure sounds like it’s keeping you safe.
