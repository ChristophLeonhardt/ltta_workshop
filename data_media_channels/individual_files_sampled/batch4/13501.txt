as market surged after Trump shreds NAFTA we have to ask ourselves is it possible that the smart people are stupid and the stupid people are smart then speaking of dopes one in seven Americans smokes pot we will analyze the growing popularity of Haitian oregano in the u.s. left-wing shill Lanny Davis admits that admitted liar Michael Cohen is a liar CNN pays no heed then more demagoguery of dead people hashtag me to Hollywood hypocrites why everybody is suddenly transgender and bad parents I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Noel's show we've got a lot to get to today as you can tell and oh oh this this whole thing for those of you who are not listening you might be confused I'm wearing an American flag bow tie right now that is of course because it is national bowtie day I could not let that day pass unheeded this brings up a long-standing debate among American conservatives is it super cool to wear the American flag is clothing or is it disrespectful to the flag every this always happens you wear like Chubby's has those little shorts you know the swim trunks and they look like an American flag and then some conservatives say that's disrespectful and then others say it's awesome it's awesome it's great where where the American flag the reason you should do it this isn't true at all times in history and in all cultures but our culture is so anti-american right now anyway that you can get the flag out there that's good do it where it's great there's another debate of course over bowties which is our bowties you know like American conservative mid-century cool or do they always look terrible there is there's just no acceptable time to wear them you know which side of that argument that I come down on but I'd be interested to hear your thoughts in the comments so we've got to talk about dopes today we've got a lot of dopes in America we've got stupid smart people smart stupid people and everybody is getting high there's a new study out that shows that one in seven Americans smokes pot in his smoke pot within the last year for comment on this we turn to daily wire pot correspondents Cheech and Chong we're pretty interesting yeah I I would have to agree that is some heavy stuff man that's some heavy stuff one in seven Americans the question is who cares if we're smoking pot this is this perennial debate among not just the left and the right but within the right between the libertarians and the conservatives hey let's just legalize it and this issue this issue of legal pot is one of the great examples of conservatives throwing their hands up and saying oh who cares I don't want to fight anymore that's okay blah blah blah I am gonna make the point that perhaps we shouldn't be gung-ho about legalizing pot and there are a few reasons for this one right now in America one in five people live in a state with legal pot because lefty states with big populations are more likely to have legalized pot the pot industry is pretty big the pot into the legal pot industry was almost six billion dollars last year I have no idea how big the illegal pot industry which is still still accounts for the majority of it in America 50% of people have tried pot at least once the majority at least 50% the majority of Americans have tried pot at least once judging by my outfit today as you can guess I too have tried the old Haitian oregano once or a few times and I'm not saying that I haven't done it a lot of people have done it and it leads to bizarre results as much as you're looking at right here 11% of Americans are regular users of pot so the and and one-in-seven have had it within the last year they might not be regular users they might not be waking and baking or smoking every night or something but they have it every so often you know once you cut twice a year and that number is way way up that number has doubled within either the last decade or the last few decades it breaks down by sex so for women the number has doubled since 1984 for men the number has doubled since of around the year 2000 but the numbers are way way up what does this mean obviously pot is being mainstreamed why is it being mainstreamed it's being mainstreamed by the culture and it's being mainstreamed by the government a lot of states are pushing for legalization a lot of states have legalized medical marijuana a lot of states have legalized recreational marijuana in my own town of la-la-land Holly there were giant billboards on the street that say get we'd delivered to your door come on it's really use a nap and you get pot delivered to your door the the debate around pot is very very stupid I'm not saying that there aren't good points on both sides I'm saying that the debate is always extremely stupid because it usually goes something like this well man you know man pot is way better for you than better than booze because booze gets you angry man a pipe just mellows you out yeah and it's totally not addictive and it's and it really expands your mind you know like what if the color you see is red I see is blue you know man it just makes you so smart doesn't make you smart it makes you stupider and less funny and and the trend one of the really awful things about pot and I can tell you this from experience it's not like I've never smoked pot before is that you think you think when you're a smoking pot that you're smarter and funnier but you're not you just think that because you have become stupider I remember you know in I'll give examples of this because when I say that I've smoked pot on more than one occasion and I did inhale like it's actually very hard for me to inhale though because I smoked cigars and I've smoked cigars since I was a kid so when I tried to smoke pot which was much later I couldn't do it like I just I still would coffee you know dramatically even I can't have a cigarette you know for that reason but in I think it was chef on South Park who says that there is a time and a place for everything in that place is college so there is this thing at Yale which is Spring Fling and every every year on Spring Fling you know they bring bands in and you know it's a big party every year the they treat pot brownies like it's a sacrament you know like it's just very popular at least it was when I was there and so I would try this and this put to rest a lot of my thoughts on pot because we're always told oh it's not very potent it's not it doesn't it's not dangerous it's not whatever like that is total nonsense that is total nonsense first of all it is addictive there are new studies out that show that it is quite addictive it can be addictive but in between 11 and 17 percent of users and also it can be very very potent it actually can put you at risk especially when you ingest it so when you ingest unlike you know you smoke a joint or something if you ingest pot depending on the concentrations of THC which now are sold at your local dispensary in Los Angeles you can really mess you up you get your heart rate gets much much faster you get totally disoriented it'll eat you can lead to death of brain cells it can lead to memory loss especially if you do it when you're young especially if you do it over time so what does this have to do with the policy debate which it should be legalized pot shouldn't we legalize pot obviously more Americans are using pot today than they did even a decade ago dramatically more this is coinciding with the laws being liberalized I think you have to look at it from the social perspective if from a broader social context not just some stupid libertarian talking point of well you the government doesn't have a right to tell you what the government tells you a lot of things to do or well it doesn't hurt anybody well it hurts you well it doesn't hurt the guy that you run over in a car when you're driving higher it can hurt people but look at our particular point in time right now Americans are killing themselves they're killing themselves in record numbers with booze with drugs and with and and with weapons they're committing suicide at very high rates right now in the United States self-injury is as self-injury is the seventh leading cause of death it's more deadly than diabetes at this point and what the libertarians say here is well the government shouldn't intervene but the legalization of marijuana is the government intervening this is why the pot alcohol thing is so stupid alcohol has been around our culture since the dawn of time we you know Jesus Christ his first miracle on earth after the Incarnation was to make really good wine for drunk people for people who were already very drunk he made wine for them that booze has been around forever it's going to be around forever this is not an argument for booze but it's it's making a non ideological point for conservatism which is that we are we don't just pop out of nowhere we don't come into the world in floating in the air without any context we come within a social and historical context and that social and historical context has boozin it for better or worse rates of drinking have decreased dramatically since the 19th century say but it's just around us we're not going to get rid of it I don't think we really would want to get rid of it entirely there's probably a reason it's stuck around so long the question is why would you want to introduce a new drug because in the West pot doesn't come from our tradition it hasn't been around for 2,000 years Jesus didn't perform the miracle of I don't know turning oregano into marijuana that's that's not in our culture that's not in our history so why would you want to introduce a new one all of the arguments that the pro pot people say against alcohol are also arguments for not legalizing marijuana by saying that one is better than the other it's not saying that they're good right they're both bad for you there's a lot of tar in marijuana it's bad for your health it makes you stupid or it makes you it also one thing about alcohol is it's a social lubricant so if you go like this is one of the reasons why it's persisted in culture for so long is you know just unless you're very depressing you don't just sit in your room alone and guzzle whiskey you know you I mean I I do it for breakfast obviously but that's just to get ready for to meet you for my show I have a nice and nice short stack of pancakes and a gallon of room-temperature gin but you know it's a social lubricant it kind of amps you up a little bit you have to talk to people whereas pot is very much a its best in solitude because it makes you stupid and because it makes you less funny it really just they they always say well it really makes you think it really makes you expands your mind right it doesn't do that but it's a drug for solitude so if we've got this problem we've got this major drug problem is major opioid epidemic these these people killing themselves with stimulants and drugs and whatever why would we allow a new one to be introduced the government the government just like us doesn't come from nowhere it's not just floating it comes from a historical context right now pot is broadly illegal if pot is legalized that is not the lack of government intervention that specifically is government intervention to legalize that why would we want to do it last year alone seventy-two thousand people died from drug overdoses in the United States this is a record number and 20 teen is already on track to blow past that number why would you want to do it you know this is a big mistake of libertarianism I noticed this whenever conservatives give up an issue they always say well now I'm a libertarian on this issue but it's only after they lose the issue though now I'm a libertarian so they do this sometimes for that for those who became pro-choice in favor of abortion during the the height of abortion advocacy you know the 1990s it's really pro-choice they would say oh well I'm a libertarian I'm a lipid there's nothing libertarian about killing a baby there's nothing in the libertarian ideology or doctrine that says you have to be able to kill babies of course not libertarianism protects a life liberty and property life comes first not not liberty the same thing they did this on gay marriage they'll say the conservatives who'd said marriage has a definition and sexual difference in hears in marriage sexual difference has something to do in marriage and that's why it's not that gay people can't get married it's that marriage does not involve a marriage demand sexual difference now that the left seems to have won that battle at the Supreme Court in the culture they say on the libertarian there's nothing libertarian about saying we have to adopt this very radical new definition of marriage but not previous definitions and not other definitions there's nothing libertarian about saying that marriage has to now be defined as a union of two people regardless of sex who love each other for whatever purpose you want rather than the previous definition which is it's the union of husbands and wives for family or some other definition why doesn't why isn't it libertarian to say that marriage involves the polygamous union of same-sex people why is that isn't isn't that libertarian why don't we have that no it's just a total cop-out and they do this with drugs they say well when it comes to drugs I'm a libertarian this is this presents a very mistaken view of virtues and of the tradition that we come out of and a political philosophy drugs enslave you I'm not I'm not saying that you can't have little you know a glass of wine and moderations of whiskey and moderation even a smoke of pot in moderation I'm saying that when you become addicted when you use drugs excessively when you abuse drugs they enslave you you were giving in to your appetite you're not you're not living rationally you're not living consciously you're not living in freedom there's nothing libertarian about that that's that's libertine not libertarian and it's a it's a big mistake conservatives shouldn't give this one up they shouldn't give up anything they shouldn't be feel bullied and be intimidated by the left to give up points and needlessly and then pretend that that's libertarianism that creates a nation of dopes and this point was underscored beautifully by President Trump just this past week because what were we told during the election Trump is he's gonna be terrible for the economy and if he if he gets rid of NAFTA the North American Free Trade Agreement the agreement between Canada the United States and Mexico the economies could implode it through the awful prices are gonna rise where it's gonna be awful from Mexico for Canada especially for the United States so President Trump rips up NAFTA he creates a bilateral trade agreement with Mexico and says remember Mexico we were never going to be able to deal with Mexico now we've got a great relationship with Mexico all the smart people told us it would be terrible we have a great relationship with Mexico and the president from says Canada is more than welcome to come in but if they're not going to agree to our terms they can stay out what happened when this was announced NAFTA ripped up bilateral trade deal all the smart set predicted it instead of the economy crashing the markets reach record highs record highs the sp500 was up almost one percent yesterday Nasdaq was up almost 1% yesterday the Nasdaq broke 8,000 I think that's an all-time record the Dow jumped 259 points all the way up this was the first time yesterday that the Dow was above 26,000 since February the markets universally responded well to this news about NAFTA we also found out today that consumer confidence is at an 18-year high but remember this you've got to remember this because it always gets blown over in the media nobody ever talks about this in the mainstream media so you just forget that these things happen you forget when these pundits when the smart set when the the self-appointed betters and sophisticates and self-styled smart people when they predict things they get it totally wrong and then they get to go right on making predictions here thus just just to refresh your memory here is a little prediction from these self-appointed smart set the stupid smart people of what was going to happen to the economy if President Trump was elected are you saying that if Trump wins and I do to offer that the markets are going down fifteen percent ten percent I think ten percent it may actually if it looks like he's close it may drift a little before but the net effect will be about ten percent he has no real strategy for creating jobs just a string of empty promises and maybe we shouldn't expect better from someone whose most famous words are you're fired Donald Trump offers no real solutions for the economic challenges we face I have my Trump hedge on in the event Donald wins I have no doubt in my mind the the market tanks Donald Trump's ideas about the economy and the world will cause millions of Americans to lose their jobs and what happened what what could we ask what happened let's let's because these guys say Hillary Clinton who is that Mark Cuban the billionaire who just goes runs his mouth on TV all these predictors don't lose sight of what they're saying they're saying millions of jobs will be lost the economy will tank they're making actual predictions none of which happened and yet we still look to them they're the smart people they're the stable people Hillary Clinton she's stable she's the stable sure she's the reasonable choice Oh pish-posh we can't vote for Trump he's crazy Hillary she's stable she's she's stable wrong she's very in a very stable way she's wrong her predictions did not come true here is what actually happened confidence is the highest it's been in many years just came out manufacturing the highest level of confidence they've had since they started doing it many years ago and business it has the highest level of confidence I was president Trump in the Cabinet Room earlier today he also pointed out which he likes to do but it's a fact look at the chart Dow is up more than 5,000 points in one years never done that for 70 new highs for the Dow Jones Industrials remember when everyone said the market was just gonna tank the day after the election and fall through the floor didn't happen historic tax reform on top of that 3% GDP growth and a forecast to potentially do 4% in the third quarter we'll see if that happens moments ago the numbers for America's economic growth or GDP were just released and I am thrilled to announce that in the second quarter of this year the United States economy grew at the amazing rate of 4.1% we're on track to hit the highest annual average growth rate in over 13 years and I will say this right now and I'll say it strongly as the trade deals come in one by one we're going to go a lot higher than these numbers and these are great numbers during each of the two previous administrations we averaged just over 1.8 percent GDP growth by contrast we are now on track to hit an average GDP annual growth of over 3% and it could be substantially over 3% remember those images remember those two clips that you just saw because I think sometimes sometimes I get accused of being a little too favorable to President Trump to president khofifah sometimes people think I'm flagging for him or something like that I don't know why they would ever think that fix my American flag bow tie I think I get accused of that I think that's totally unfair because what I'd like to point out are those two clips all of this all of the smart people all of the serious sophisticated you know they're stable leaders all of those people we're totally wrong they have been totally wrong in their predictions and Donald Trump who is regularly pilloried as an absolute idiot not just by people on the left but also by people on the right by a lot of people on the right hilary him is an idiot and incompetent political newbie dummy doesn't know what he's doing that guy that person who has been pill rina on the left on the right as an idiot has been right about almost everything he's been right about virtually everything did the numbers don't lie we're just talking about the economy right now this extends in many many ways so I just want you to remember that when when you see someone and say oh he's being too favorable to President Trump President Trump has been right about virtually all of these things and it all the smart said on the left and the right have been wrong they have been wrong since the beginning this should cause us to maybe take a step back and have a little a moment of reflection here this is true not just on the economy another great example of the smart set actually probably the perfect example is a global warming climate change the Paris Accord remember the Paris Accord if we didn't sign on to the Paris Accord where all the nations are gonna get together and hug each other and that's for some reason that's going to be really good for the environment if if that doesn't happen the world will implode that's what we were told we were told that even by some people on the right but but certainly by the entire left and the president Trump said I'm not gonna sign on to that Paris Accord he was utterly pilloried for it here's just one example President Trump announcing that he's gonna pull out of the Accord and a little example of how the Left reacted the rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris agreement they went wild they were so happy for the simple reason that it put our country the United States of America which we all love at a very very big economic disadvantage what are you talking about they were happy because they secured a landmark victory for the future of the planet you go maniac firing against the United States so just keep that in mind keep that you effing maniac what are you doing yeah yeah right right Trump's the idiot and John Oliver representing the entire left in the anti-trump right he's the he's the smart guys are you so are you an idiot are you effing kidding me well it turns out Trump was entirely right and that guy was entirely wrong we have new numbers that have come out which shows that the United States is leading the world in reducing carbon dioxide emissions the United States which pulled out of the Paris agreement which said go pound sand international community you're trying to entrap us in an agreement that forces us to give up some of our freedom that forces us to play by unfair rules that gives an international advantage to other people you're not serious about helping the environment we are serious we're going to do it on our own that's what president from said pilloried by dum-dums like John Oliver and everybody else mocked laughed by frivolous frivolous audiences on HBO and then what happened the United States is leading the world in reducing co2 emissions and the signatories to the Epirus Accord are not only not keeping their promises they are increasing their co2 emissions which means that they weren't serious about the Paris Accord it means they didn't want to help the environment they weren't getting ready for this landmark international kumbaya moment they just wanted to entrap the United States in an agreement that they would not play fairly by means that Donald Trump was entirely right about this and the left and John Oliver in particular were completely wrong Canada Spain the European Union and China all increased their co2 emissions since that Paris agreement all of them we were told this agreement this is Seoul and Markey is India and China are finally gonna play along well they didn't we now know that they didn't and that guy that the stupid guy the stupid orange/mango Mussolini what an idiot he doesn't know anything about anything was completely right about this and all of the really smart people with glasses were completely wrong imagine just imagine that Hillary Clinton had won my third cousin once removed just imagine that for a second I haven't watched a clip of Hillary in a while and I just watched her you know seeing it on the show right now imagine that imagine how awful that would be because she was the responsible choice all of my friends who have lots of degrees you know they have PhDs and master's degrees and law degrees and doctors and all do to do to do all of them they were horrified that I voted for Donald Trump horrified they say you can't that's irresponsible that's your respect he's not competent he's not smart he's reckless he's that guy's been totally right Hiler all of Hillary's predictions were not and not only have not come true but the opposite has actually come true and then we got news today that her email server that competent Hillary expert Hillary stable Hillary that her email server that we already know has been hacked by bad actors was also hacked by the Chinese that information came out today her email server was hacked by the Chinese they installed a code such that her emails emails that were going to her from her were being sent to these to this Chinese entity in real time that's stable Hillary that's the smart person I don't have Donald Trump's emails been hacked by multiple foreign adversaries has that happened yet maybe it'll happen I don't right that hasn't happened yet I haven't seen that that big that big dummy who doesn't know anything he's managed to avoid that but all the smart people like Hillary Clinton and they get their emails hacked by multiple major foreign adversaries unbelievable and and then the story gets better it gets like a if someone wrote this movie and then pitched it to a Hollywood studio the studio would say no it's too on-the-nose that's too obvious that's too you couldn't do it this the the hack by China was reported to the FBI multiple times and the FBI did nothing about it and and who was it at the FBI who did nothing about it Peter struck ladies and gentlemen that lover boy disgraced the FBI agent who testified before Congress and looked like the devil incarnate you know that maniacal face and smile and horns spreading out of his head Peter struck it was that guy and the reason that this would be rejected if it were a Hollywood pitch is that it's like I thought there were more FBI agents than that how come this guy keeps popping up you think aren't there hold on a second all right there they're more than like five people that work at the FBI right but this guy Peter struck seems to always crop up at the center of corruption at all times the emails with his lover girl trying to nail Trump investigating Trump based on faulty paid-for Democrat hack dossiers then he's on a Muller investigation trying to get Trump again he actually gets fired for that reason and he's the one who won't report that Hillary has been incompetently handling her emails unbelievable you know all of this should serve as a warning then I've got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube all of this I bring up to you all the way from the pot and those dope heads to the dope heads on CNN HBO the left always tries to intimidate us and I'll even go more broadly than the left the left and the preening anti Trump right always try to intimidate us by making conservative people think we're stupid they try to they try to make us think that we're stupid they say we're really smart look we were tweed we have tweed jackets ago we have bowties we have special glasses you know we go we sip Shelley you don't even know what Shelley is we sip Shelley we know we're the competent ones were the stable ones you can't vote for Trump he's an idiot he's a fool he's a dummies doesn't know what he's doing he's a bla bla bla bla bla just remember that in a broad array of issues over just the last year or two years that self-appointed smart set has been utterly wrong have been made to look like total fools and the stupid people the hacks the partisans the Trump apologists the lackeys the Magga crowd the blah blah blah have been correct about everything just keep that in mind I'd like people to remember that because I think sometimes this gets forgotten and and we'll get to why that gets forgotten it's because the new not only are the news media stacked against us but everything around the news media are stacked against us this has just come out in the last day before we get to that I've got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube donut this is very frustrating because we've got so much more to talk about but we'll talk about it once we see you at the Le wire comm if you're at Daily wire comm thank you very much you helped keep the lights on you keep Kofi Fay in my cup you keep me in still bowties and tweed jackets if you're not there if you're on Facebook and YouTube you won't be for long cuz they're going to censor us so go over to daily wire it's ten bucks a month 100 dollars for an annual membership what do you get you get me you get the Enric Laban show you get the Ben Shapiro show you get to ask questions in the mailbag that's coming up Thursday you test questions in the conversation that's gonna be the big boss Ben Shapiro coming up very soon none of that matters here it is here mmm-hmm was this brew was this imported from Mexico or from Canada with this made right here in the United States I don't know but this is the NAFTA brew this is the NAFTA brew and it and it tastes like yeah it tastes like the Nasdaq hitting 8,000 that's what it tastes like it tastes like the S&P hitting records and it tastes like mmm yeah I'm getting a slight hint on the top of the palate of the Dow Jones breaking 26,000 for the first time since February I'm getting justyou can kind of get it a little hint on the nose go to Daly wire.com we'll be right back we had a lot more to talk about so why do we always forget that the smart people are stupid and the stupid people are smart the reason is that the news media are not only totally turned against conservatives and the Trump administration but everything around the news media are as well there's a new piece out it's a PJ Media I suggest you go read it by Paula bully yard that shows she just searched Trump in Google News Google News major news source I check it constantly and just search Trump ninety-six percent of the results even for her who is a conservative you would think they might be more tailored to skew conservative for her ninety six percent of the results were from left-wing news sources ninety-six percent of them the only wire doesn't seem to crop up does it but voxcom certainly does 96 percent and the sources by the way are liars we have this story out today CNN ran a story about how Donald Trump knew about Russian collusion and knew of the Russia meeting at Trump Tower and knew about all of this knew about all of this the source for those stories was lanny davis the left-wing hacky attorney for Michael Cohen so the source really is Michael Cohen through that just within the last day Lanie Davis has come out and said oh yeah I was just kidding do I was just kidding I don't I can't say I don't know that Donald Trump knew ahead of time about the Russian meeting oh I don't I can't say I don't what do I know I don't know but last week he was saying Bob Muller should talk to Michael Cohen we've got damaging information on Trump and Russia we're we he's got a lot that he should hear and now he's completely changed his tune so Lanny Davis was the source for this story was reported everywhere after it made it to CNN and all the confirming sources were Lanny Davis turnouts turns out it wasn't true Lanny Davis himself is saying yeah I lied and who knows if he lied her if Michael Cohen lied I don't know but what I do know is CNN won't retract the story some people are noticing that CNN worded their story in such a way that they can probably get away with it because it's just extraordinarily misleading but it's it's a dishonest I mean these are people who are lying by omission or misleading in such a way that it's a lie the media Research Center is also showing the extent of Big Tex censoring us because you hear it from us look we see our views fluctuate very wildly depending on changes in these social media algorithms and depending on what who they're censoring that week but these are just little anecdotes the media Research Center went in and went past the insinuation to get to some specifics we know that Twitter specifically with shadow banning people whose profiles used the words America or God because they thought they were robots can you imagine for a second if you just a met just pity the Twitter executives here let's not ascribe it to malice let's describe a district they think they're in such an anti-american bubble they're in such an absurd left-wing bubble that they think that if you use the words America or God you can't be a human being you have to be a robot and their shadow banning people for that they also won't run ads for pro-life advocacy groups they will run ads for Planned Parenthood that's one specific area we know that they put specific care behind the trending hashtags Podesta emails and DNC leaked during the election they suppress that they shadow banned those hashtags even though they were they were clearly making the rounds among popular users on Facebook Facebook shadow banned or suppress trending stories from Mitt Romney's CPAC and Rand Paul on the flip side when black lives matter was not trending Facebook bumped that up and made it trending news to spread the message of black lives matter that's another specific it's not just the news - it's not just these platforms that's not just Google News Google search also is favoring Democrats so when you search for any of these things not in news but in the regular google.com you're gonna get a slew of left-wing articles over right-wing articles is it any wonder that we think this that the stupid smart people are smart and the smart stupid people are stupid it's because all of the curation around our information is tailored to give us that false impression why else we know that YouTube is censoring videos we know that Google YouTube and Twitter are partnering with far-left organizations the Southern Poverty Law Center I have a great honor because it said that my Prager you video is the most egregious one that's a great I want like a I want to frame that statement and make it a prize we know that Twitter's advisers on content or twelve to one skew leftist twelve to one and we know that they partner with these fact checkers which are far far left-wing Facebook partners with Snopes the fact checker Snopes Snopes flagged the babylon be an obviously satirical publication for criticizing CN n flagged it on facebook and it went through outrageous we don't have a ton of time but i want to call your attention to that cuz when you're using google when you're using google news you have to be aware that there is a very intentional narrative being built around you there is a force at work that is trying to convince you that the smart people are stupid and the stupid people are smart and that's why you think that it's why it's a prejudice in public discourse is because people sitting at these companies are creating it for you speaking of fact checks speaking of fact checks we do need to fact check the media and the memes here we have to get to some more demagoguery of dead people i've tried to avoid talking about john mccain or Molly Tibbets too much to people who have died recently who have become major news stories obviously and who have been injected into public debate i don't really blame people for injecting them into public debate first of all john mccain is a public figure so that goes for that saying and that molly Tibbets news story was a major national news story before politics got involved at all so i'm not really blaming people but right now there is a debate going on because molly Tibbets was killed by an illegal alien the left is so upset with this that they're trying to pretend that he wasn't an illegal alien but he was an illegal alien all of the evidence we have at our disposal says he was an illegal alien and this is in an obvious point for conservatives who say if if we enforce our laws that guy wouldn't have been in the country simple as that we enforced our laws that guy wouldn't've been in the country that's not to say that illegal aliens murder more people than native-born people do that's not to say that illegal aliens murder more people than other immigrant groups like legal immigrant groups do it's not to say any of those things it's just to say very simply that person wasn't supposed to be in the country it was a failure of law enforcement and really a failure of politics was in the country and that what that girl would be alive today if he wasn't in the country if we enforced our border laws that's a simple observation now the left is doubling down there saying how dare you this is awful and there's a statement that's floating around that is people are purporting is from the Tibbets family writ large or that it's from Mali tippins's mother it's actually from a woman named sandy Tibbets Murphy and Sandy Tippett's Murphy is not Molly tippins's mother even though that has been reported in various social media platforms that isn't the case she's a cousin of Molly Tibbets and she sent at this statement that was very left-wing excoriated the GOP I just I just want to read this to show you how ridiculous it is I'm not really I'm criticizing her statement I'm not criticizing her because she's grieving a family member has died but we have to correct the record because you can't let this kind of actual fake news fester sandy Tibbets Murphy sent out this statement it reads this what no no no no especially for those of you who did not know her in life you do not get to usurp Molly and her legacy for your racist false narrative now that she is no longer with us molly was killed in a man has been arrested and charged with her murder yes that man is an immigrant to this country he's not an immigrant he's an illegal alien but I go on with uncertainty as to his legal status it's not really uncertain all of the evidence says he's illegal I go on but it matters not he could have been a citizen born in this country he could have been an older white man from anywhere he could have been a man from Molly's world I'll go on and then we can discuss this because the the political propaganda in this statement is very frustrating she goes on he is a man whose path in life crossed that of Molly's life with tragic results he is a man who felt entitled to impose himself on Molly's life without consequences he's a man who because of his sense of male entitlement refused to allow Molly the right to reject his advances the right to her own autonomy molly was murdered me as a man denied her right to say so our national discussion needs to be about violence committed in society mostly by men it is not your right to exacerbate this grievous act by hijacking Molly and all she believed with your racist fear-mongering you do not get to use her murder to inaccurately promote your permanently separated hyper you do not have permission to callously use this tragedy to demonize an entire population for the acts of one man no we reclaim our Mali respectfully respectfully sandy Tibbets Murphy you do not have the right to use this murder to push your sexist propaganda just that you're saying that we don't we don't have the right to push a an ostensibly racist propaganda you don't have the right to push a sexist propaganda look at this she said it's not because he was an illegal alien it's cuz he is a man again I'm not crime not really criticizing this girl I don't know this girl she's probably very much in mourning because her cousin is dead but we have to correct this record because what she's saying is don't blame illegal aliens blame all men how is that how is that fixing the painting with a broad brush you're saying we're painting a small group of the broad brush you're painting a gigantic group with a broad brush that isn't true she says well it could have been a different man it could have been a white guy could have been a middle-aged guy right but it wasn't it wasn't any of those things he was an illegal alien the reality all of the probabilities collapse into this reality and that's the reality that we have to deal with she says that we shouldn't push the permanently separated hyperbole that's not hyperbole Molly Timmons has been permanently separated from her family we shouldn't have to tell a member of her family that I'm very sorry for those who are grieving that isn't hyperbole that's a real that's a real fact and we have to deal in facts we have to deal in reality and not deal with a bunch of fake news and political propaganda if if people aren't going to if the family doesn't want this to be politicized I totally understand that but then one should not be politicizing it on the other side as well we're running so late as usual so I do want to get to - Luisi Kane Michael Ian Black speaking of toxic masculinity Toria it was a toxic masculinity louis c.k you remember this we remember when louis c.k exposed himself to a bunch of women and co-workers and people now he showed up recently in a comedy club and he started performing people were surprised you know someone complained and said I didn't know he was going to be here this is nine months after five women co-workers you know accused him of assaulting them so Michael in black Lefty par XL he comes out and he tweets this quote will take heat for this but people have to be allowed to serve their time and move on with their lives I don't know if it's been long enough or his career will recover or if people will have him back but I'm happy to see him try ok so Michael Ian Black is the guy who previously tweeted quote this is right after Trump was elected tonight I explained sexual assault to my 13 year old daughter hashtag Magga okay he also tweeted at Ted Cruz he said hi Ted Cruz this was when the race was going on in Alabama for the Senate hi Ted Cruz just wondering if you've seen the latest allegation of sexual assault of a 16 year old by Roy Moore and if you still endorse his candidacy so that's Michael Ian Black and now he's coming around when it's one of his when it was a Republican who's been accused of sexual crimes then he's on his high horse he's sanctimonious when it's a friend of his all of a sudden we need a little grace we need a little mercy we need to let people have you know come on man let them recover this is total hackery and it brings up this point that we've talked about a little earlier with the dupes I think sometimes people think that I'm advocating too much for Donald Trump right play favorites or something like that and that isn't the case I'm not being partisan here I'm just being honest and these people are not being honest people like Michael Ian Black self-serious on his high horse sanctimonious until it's his friend and then all of a sudden it's completely different because Michael Ian Black obviously does not care about sexual assault he doesn't seem to care about it one little bit he's just scoring political points had he not said that about louis c.k then perhaps we could take him seriously he's trying to score political points and there are a lot of people this happens in politics too when people try to tell you oh I don't have a preference here oh no I don't know no I'm just I'm floating above it all I'm above it all I'm just you know I'm I'm self-righteous in this or whatever you can tell that those guys have a partisan agenda and they're just not being honest Ben has said this very well about the daily wire and CNN people say the daily wire is right-wing he said yes we have a point of view but we're open about our point of view CNN is not open about its point of view that's why they're fake news and we're not fake news this is very important because demagogues always do this they always try to sell I'm floating above all this how dare you how dare you get on your high horse but honest people are gonna deal honestly with you and president Trump does this very very much in in his daily politics which is he doesn't pretend to be something other than he is he doesn't pretend to have different goals than he has he doesn't pretend that his politics are in his politics he's openly political he is a guilelessly political this is horrifying to some who have been soaked in this incompetent mucky culture of Lies and oiliness and it's refreshing to others who say Oh at least I know where I stand Oh he said he was gonna rip up NAFTA and then he did oh he said he was gonna lower taxes and then he did oh he said he was good I know where I stand this is a very good thing we have you know gosh we have so much more to get to but we're at a time we're out of time that's too bad because we have I do want to talk about there's a new study at a brown that shows that transgenderism gender confusion is a social contagion and this is of course been suppressed by the PC crowd the so-called party of science that can't that doesn't like when science contradicts their own ideological narratives and there are some very important reasons as to why this is happening in our culture it dates back to the stay in history which is when Prince Prince Charles and Princess Diana got divorced not just their divorce but divorce broadly I guess we're just gonna have to talk about it tomorrow how's that for a cliffhanger huh it's that good because it's really politically incorrect in fact I'm you know what we've got to talk about it tomorrow so that this episode gets to stay up then I'll say this it's probably the least politically correct thing you can ever say tomorrow and my show will get cancelled but at least we'll have gotten a good one in the can okay that's our show get your mailbag questions in for Thursday in the
