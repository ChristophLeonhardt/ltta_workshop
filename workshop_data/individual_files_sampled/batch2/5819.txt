welcome back as we've said senator McCain's death will have a profound effect on the Senate but it's not just that the Senate is losing a statesman it's also losing one of the few Republicans willing to stand up to President Trump especially when it comes to issues of national security without McCain Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe is the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee and he is a lot more friendly to President Trump than McCain was moments ago senator Inhofe reportedly said listen to this McCain is partially to blame for the White House flag controversy I'm joined now by Rhode Island senator Jack Reed the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee that McCain chaired senator first off to to this this news from Senator Inhofe I think he was speaking to CNN when he said that Senator McCain was responsible for the White House not keeping the flag at at half-staff today because he was so vocally outspoken against this president well I believe the president should have maintained the flag at half-staff it's honoring an individual who gave his life for the country and it you know I think senator nado understands and respects the sacrifices of Senator McCain met made for his country so I think the the president ultimately made the right decision and I think engaging in sort of a dissection of that decision at this point what about Senator Inhofe saying that McCain was it was at fault for it well I don't I I think that is not accurate simply because senator McCain's actions should not have prompted a response in any way shape or form of the president something that appeared to me to be petty rather than presidential and frankly I think it ultimately appeared to the President to be inappropriate he reversed his decision he issued a proclamation of the flags will be at half-staff appropriately until Senator McCain is buried at Annapolis and that's the right thing to do so I'm Senate senator corker is also retiring an opening in the Foreign Relations Committee as well with with corker gone next year and with McCain now gone are you concerned about the void in in Republican leadership in these very important committees with Republicans who are willing to push back on the president especially when it comes to to issues of national security well we're losing several powerful voices that the most policy is John McCain but bob Corker has been a very thoughtful and very statesman like colleague in the Senate there has to be individuals will step up and it has to be all of us not just Republicans but also Democrats stepping up trying to do it as John McCain did it so often on a bipartisan basis issue by issue ultimately I hope what convinces my colleagues to take the appropriate action is that what we do ultimately affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of young Americans in uniform and they deserve are not anything unless I should say then then our commitment to the country and our commitment to the Constitution I hope that inspires my colleagues including myself to step up more if there was a Democratic president would you think if you were the leader of the Armed Services Committee important important too to be skeptical of the commander and commander in chief why would you think and be important to be skeptical if you agree well I think it's very important to be skeptical because first of all we have an independent role in the Congress we have independent powers and we have to ensure the decisions are made regardless whether it's a fellow Democrat or Republican are the best in terms of the country and to the future of the nation that requires not blind loyalty it requires very observant and it's sometimes critical but critical in a way that's not simply partisan disruptive but constructive and that's what I hope we can do with John McCain gone who's gonna who's gonna fill that void who will be the next John McCain well I think what you're going to see younger members of the Senate and other colleagues stepping up I think what you'll see also will be an issue-by-issue basis there'll be an issue that that really engages someone they'll step forward and they'll take the lead they'll be followed by it we hope bipartisan group of senators I don't think that anyone right now who's been being prepared for groom for you know taking the place of John McCain first of all I think it'd be virtually impossible to take his place individually I think what you're going to see is and what I hope you see is all of us stepping up significantly to fill the gap that he's left in this highly partisan climate that we're living in where if you go against the president you're likely to lose your seat won't be able to win a primary it's why corker is not running for reelection it's why flake isn't running for re-election John McCain knotti not popular in his home state of Arizona by a majority of Republicans any longer because of what he said about the president in this partisan climate is it possible for lawmakers to defy their leader well what will make it possible is the American people if it's very clear in these elections in November that they want a change in behavior change in tone a change in outlook then you'll see that happen that is the governing frankly and thankfully the governing factor in the United States it's the will of citizens and that's why it's important for all of our colleagues our American citizens not just our colleagues and Senate to get involved get active and to vote because they have to send the message and if the message is if you're a Republican just follow a president blindly or if it was a Democratic president the same message that's not going to be helpful it has to be a message of responsibility and respect for the Constitution let me switch gears and ask you about present trampin and the ongoing legal drama that seems to be closing in on him what happened last week with his longtime fixer his his former personal lawyer saying that he did commit a crime admitting to being a felon and implicating the president and it was it was a pretty big deal one of your Democratic lawmaker colleagues in the House Jerry Nadler was on Meet the Press over the weekend and and just listen to what he said well I think the Muller investigation has to continue first and foremost and the committee has to defend the Muller investigation against the president's and the Republicans in Congress attempts to sabotage it to discredit it and to discredit the FBI and the Department of Justice Congress is supposed to be a check and balance on the executive and we ought to be holding investigations representative Nadler says we ought to be holding as Democrats ought to be holding investigations do you believe Democrats are doing enough are you holding enough investigations or trying to hold enough investigations considering all of the all of this very serious legal questions that surround the president and the fact that his former lawyer has implicated him in a crime well the the reality is that the investigatory processes of the center in the house are controlled by the Republican majority they set the agenda they set the chair the hearings they certainly spent a great deal of time looking into the behavior and activities of secretary State Clinton they have not spent the same amount of time with perhaps the exception of the Senate Intelligence Committee senator Brewer and Senator Warner on a bipartisan basis have looked and continue to look at some of these issues involving Russian reaction and interaction or not campaign but I believe that Gerry's right we have to be much more aggressive but I don't think that will happen as long as the Republicans are controlling the procedural mechanisms of the House and Senate Senator Jack Reed senator thank you very much thank you hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so
