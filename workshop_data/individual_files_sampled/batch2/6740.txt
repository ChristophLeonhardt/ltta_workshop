there have been calls from progressives to abolish ice and if you look into some of the allegations against members of ice you'll understand why there have been two individuals involved in immigration control that have faced some serious criminal charges as of late first there's Blake North way from organ it turns out that State Police Detectives arrested Blake North Way who was 55 years old in Medford Oregon last Thursday following a joint investigation between the Oregon State Police and ices Office of Professional Responsibility and he has been charged with 10 felony charges of sodomy and one charge of incest officials stated that the charges have nothing to do with his role at ice but even though we don't know the exact details of what he allegedly did these are some pretty serious accusations or charges 10 felony charges of sodomy and one charge of incest now these charges came forth after another individual who's connected with border patrol had been arrested in connection to four murders so Juan David Ortiz is the u.s. Border Patrol supervisor who was arrested and he's been charged with murder in the deaths of four female sex workers following what authorities call a two-week killing spree that ended with a fifth woman escaped from him at the Texas gas station she then went to go find help when authorities were looking for him they eventually found him he fled and was found hiding in a truck in a hotel parking lot in Laredo Texas also two of the women who were victims were US citizens but the nationalities of the other two were not yet known and people were concerned that he was probably getting information about the manhunt about him because he's in law enforcement so he might have been receiving that information but as it turns out luckily the fifth woman escaped found a state trooper who did a great job and and they pursued him and they got him the part of the story that I have to confess that I liked was him hiding in a truck in the hotel parking lot the tough guy when you're going to go commit those you know violent acts against women and that you think have no power but when you think people are coming to get you all of a sudden you're quivering in a you know hiding from the authorities and not so tough after all what's crazy about this story is after authorities found him he did confess to the murders and a few of the murders actually two of them took place in the hours after the fifth woman had escaped and alerted authorities so I'm it's such a tragic story I'm glad they caught him but I think it's important to highlight these stories because you know when we have conversations about immigration in the country all immigrants who are here and and who are not documented are defamed and slandered as criminals and rapists and members of ms-13 I think it's about time we take a good hard look at some of the criminals that we've employed to keep immigration under control well look two things about that as we've shown you over and over again crime statistics show that people were American citizens commit crime at higher rates than undocumented immigrants as significantly higher rates now that doesn't mean that make assumptions about American citizens we're all American citizens here noting that we're all in the immortal words of Donald Trump criminals and rapists but to say that a group that commits significantly less crime than the average American are criminals or rapists Trump called them is outrageous especially when it turns out when some of the people that are guarding the border theoretically against those potential criminals are the ones that are criminals themselves and and finally you know we're told whenever there's accusations against the powerful or law enforcement know just bow your head how dare you say that the cops are always right ice is always right these people just want to have open borders in the case of ice and they just want to let everybody run free without the rule of law turns out these are the guys who don't want rule of law these two particular guys I'm talking about and so should we trust anyone well unquestioningly of course not and so that includes yes sometimes law enforcement now again law enforcement is the guy who are the folks holes are caught these guys so have a I hope a little bit more sophisticated and nuanced look at the whole picture and understand that somebody's job or even citizenship doesn't necessarily mean that they are more credible than other Americans and other people in the country like what you see click this subscribe button below and don't forget to ring the bell to never miss another video from the Young Turks
