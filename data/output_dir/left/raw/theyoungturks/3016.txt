1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,360
WE GOT THE DETAILS ON THE

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,070
COMPROMISE PLAN ATTEMPTING TO
MELD THE HOUSE AND SENATE GOP

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,100
VERSIONS OF THE TAX BILLS, WHICH
HAS THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,830
FROM BOTH VERSIONS, WHICH IS
EXPECTED, THE VERSIONS WERE

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,950
DIFFERENT SO YOU NEED A VERSION
THAT'S IDENTICAL TO PASS IN

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:19,950
BOTH.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,119
THIS IS WHAT THEY WILL
ATTEMPT TO VOTE ON ON TUESDAY,

8
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,970
HERE ARE SOME OF THE DETAILS
THAT STAND OUT.

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,970
WE TALKED ABOUT

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,710
THIS EARLIER THIS WEEK, IN THE
SENATE VERSION THE TOP TAX

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,150
BRACKET WOULD STAY AT 39.6, I
THINK IN THE HOUSE IT WAS 38,

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,290
THOSE ARE DIFFERENT, UNIQUE
COMPROMISE, BY TAKING IT DOWN TO

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,290
37.

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,540
IT WILL ACTUALLY BE LOWER.

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,180
THE SENATE ACTUALLY HADN'T CUT

16
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,550
THE TOP TAX RATE SPECIFICALLY
FOR THE WEALTHIEST INDIVIDUALS

17
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,180
BUT IN THE NEW VERSION IT WILL
BE CUT.

18
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,309
IT DROPS THE CORPORATE

19
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:57,039
TAX RATE TO 21% FROM THE CURRENT
35, ONE PERCENTAGE POINT HIGHER

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,760
THAN IN THE SENATE VERSION OF
THE BILL, A DRAMATIC CUT TO

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,860
CORPORATE TAXES.

22
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,289
IT HAS A 20%
BUSINESS INCOME DEDUCTION FOR

23
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:10,109
THE FIRST APPROXIMATELY $300,000
IN INCOME EARNED BY PASS-THROUGH

24
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:13,790
BUSINESSES, THAT'S SOMETHING
WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT, THERE

25
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,060
ARE LEGITIMATE USES FOR THIS
AREA OF THE TAX CODE BUT ALSO

26
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,939
ALLOWS A LOT OF WEALTHY
INDIVIDUALS LIKE DONALD TRUMP

27
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:23,229
AND HIS FAMILY TO SORT OF
PRETEND TO BE CORPORATIONS FOR

28
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:26,780
THE PURPOSE OF PERSONAL INCOME
AND WILL ALLOW THEM TO PAY A

29
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,639
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER TAX RATE
THROUGH THIS.

30
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:31,740
THIS BILL, LIKE

31
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,599
THE SENATE BILL, CUTS THE
MANDATE FOR OBAMACARE, IT IS

32
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,600
BELIEVED THAT IN THE MEDIUM-TERM
THIS WILL KICK ABOUT 13 MILLION

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,229
PEOPLE OFF THEIR HEALTH
INSURANCE, AND LONG-TERM MIGHT

34
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,750
UNDERMINE AND DESTROY THE
ENTIRETY OF THE ACA.

35
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,750
IT

36
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,539
ELIMINATES THE CORPORATE
ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX WHICH IS

37
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:52,329
ONE OF THE NODS TO FISCAL
RESPONSIBILITY IN THE SENATE

38
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:55,689
BILL, THAT IS NOW GONE, THAT'S
GOOD.

39
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:57,959
THE DEATH TAX, THE WAY

40
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,789
THEY CALL IT, IT'S ACTUALLY THE
ESTATE TAX, WILL REMAIN, BUT THE

41
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,490
EXEMPTION FROM IT WILL BE
DOUBLED, SO TECHNICALLY THERE

42
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,899
WILL STILL BE AN ESTATE TAX BUT
YOU CAN SHIELD TWICE AS MUCH

43
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,818
MONEY FROM IT IF YOU ARE ONE OF
THE WEALTHY PEOPLE WHO FALLS

44
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:11,590
UNDER THAT.

45
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,760
RUBIO GOT HIS
INCREASE TO THE CHILD TAX

46
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,879
CREDIT, IT'S GOING UP TO $2000
PER CHILD FROM 1000, AND THE

47
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,099
PLAN WOULD LIMIT BUT NOT
ELIMINATE STATE AND LOCAL TAX

48
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,650
DEDUCTIONS, WHICH IS ONE OF THE
BIGGEST CHANGES THAT WILL AFFECT

49
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,250
MOST PEOPLE WATCHING THIS SHOW.

50
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,700
IT WILL ALLOW A DEDUCTION OF UP

51
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,349
TO $10,000 IN STATE AND LOCAL
SALES AND INCOME AND PROPERTY

52
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,659
TAXES WHEREAS PREVIOUSLY THAT
WOULD BE ELIMINATED.

53
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:36,650
SO THIS

54
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,260
BILL AS IT STANDS IS NOT ONLY
STILL TARGETED AT WEALTHY

55
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,480
INDIVIDUALS AND CORPORATIONS, IT
IS IN FACT, FOR THE PURPOSE OF

56
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,000
INDIVIDUALS, IT'S EVEN MORE
LUXURIOUS.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,750
>>A COUPLE TAKES ON THIS.

58
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,930
FIRST
OF ALL, THE GIANT WINNERS HERE

59
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,500
ARE NOT INDIVIDUAL RICH PEOPLE,
IT'S CORPORATIONS.

60
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
EVENTUALLY

61
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,999
THAT OF COURSE GOES TO CORPORATE
EXECUTIVES, ETC., AND TO SOME

62
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:09,030
SHAREHOLDERS, BUT CORPORATIONS
MAKE OUT LIKE BANDITS HERE.

63
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,030
IN

64
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,409
THIS FINAL VERSION THERE ARE
SOME SLIGHT IMPROVEMENTS OVER

65
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:17,499
THE MORE DRACONIAN MEASURES, AND
WE SHOULD GIVE THE DEVIL IT'S

66
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:23,409
DUE AND EMPHASIZE TWO OF THOSE,
THE FACT THAT AT LEAST YOU CAN

67
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:27,709
KEEP YOUR STATE AND LOCAL TAX
DEDUCTIONS UP TO $10,000, THAT

68
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,510
PROTECTS THE MIDDLE-CLASS A
LITTLE BIT MORE.

69
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,010
>>THAT WOULD BE DEVASTATING
IF THEY PUT THAT IN,

70
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,829
ESPECIALLY IN PLACES LIKE
CALIFORNIA.

71
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:37,859
>>WHERE THAT SUNSET WHERE THE
OTHER THINGS WILL STAY?

72
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:42,749
>>MY GUT WILL SAY THAT THE ONES
TARGETING LOWER AND MIDDLE

73
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:46,120
INCOME INDIVIDUALS WILL, LIKE IN
THE SENATE VERSION, SUNSET.

74
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,950
>>WE DON'T KNOW YET.

75
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,650
>>IT JUST CAME OUT YET.

76
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,610
>>PEOPLE ARE STILL TRYING TO
PROBABLY DECIPHER THE

77
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,370
HANDWRITING IN THE MARGINS OF
THE BILL.

78
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,700
>>AT LEAST IT'S A SLIGHT
IMPROVEMENT, ANOTHER SLIGHT

79
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,620
IMPROVEMENT IS YOU WILL ONLY BE
ABLE TO SHIELDS $22 MILLION IN

80
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:12,200
PERSONAL WEALTH FOR THE ESTATE
TAX, IF YOU HAVE BILLIONS MOST

81
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,918
OF THAT WILL BE TAXED, IT'S NOT
DONALD TRUMP BEING TAXED, IT'S

82
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,119
DONALD TRUMP, JR.

83
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,720
BEING TAXED.

84
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,330
>>YOU AREN'T TALKING ABOUT A
HUGE NUMBER OF ESTATES THAT ARE

85
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,180
AFFECTED SO TO THINK THAT THIS
SOMEHOW MAKES ALL THIS GREAT IS

86
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,479
RIDICULOUS, IT DOESN'T. THERE
AREN'T THAT MANY ESTATES THAT

87
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,150
ARE AFFECTED BY THIS.

88
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,090
THE CRIME
IN HERE HAS TO DO WITH THE

89
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,870
PERMANENCE OF THAT CORPORATE TAX
AND IT GOING DOWN TO 21%, EVEN

90
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,340
THOUGH THERE WAS A 1% CONCESSION
BECAUSE INITIALLY IT WAS GOING

91
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,150
TO BE 20%, COME ON.

92
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,961
I THOUGHT IT WAS RIDICULOUS WHEN
THEY WERE GOING BACK TO 22

93
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,680
AND I GUESS REPUBLICANS FIGURED
OUT HOW TO GET IT LOWER.

94
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,920
ANYTHING ON MORTGAGE INTEREST?

95
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,740
>>I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING, I READ
THAT AT LEAST YESTERDAY THE

96
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,360
MASSIVE CHANGE TO HOW THEY TAX
GRADUATE STUDENTS WAS BEING

97
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,460
DROPPED, THAT WOULD BE
DEVASTATING.

98
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,460
I'M GLAD YOU

99
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,460
BROUGHT UP THE ESTATE TAX.

100
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,460
SOME
OF THESE IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO

101
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,110
KNOW IF IT AFFECTS YOU, IF IT
DOESN'T ALL. AND I KNOW BECAUSE

102
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:21,729
OF HOW THE ESTATE TAX -- THE
SIMPLE WAY TO TELL IS, DO YOU

103
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:23,650
LIVE ON AN ESTATE?

104
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:29,849
I DON'T, SO I
WON'T BENEFIT FROM THIS.

105
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:31,710
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.

106
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,430
>>NOT QUITE LITERAL BUT I LIKE
YOUR POINT.

107
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,000
>>THE HEADLINE, CENK, YOU WENT
TO THE MEAT OF THE CORPORATE

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,060
TAX, THE HEADLINE IS THIS
OBAMACARE STUFF.

109
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,060
THAT WILL

110
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,150
ADVERSELY AFFECT MIDDLE CLASS
PEOPLE.

111
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,479
AND I THINK THERE IS NO

112
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:51,830
QUESTION THAT THIS IS A WAY THAT
THEY ARE ABLE, THAT THE

113
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,039
PRESIDENT SPECIFICALLY, CAN SAY
WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO IT

114
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,150
DIRECTLY WITH HEALTHCARE SO WE
WILL SQUEEZE IT IN HERE.

115
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,150
THIS

116
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,659
ISN'T ANYTHING NEW WE ARE JUST
LEARNING TODAY.

117
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:01,659
BUT THIS TO ME

118
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:05,409
IS THE MOST IMPACTFUL PART OF
THIS AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE

119
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:06,860
MOST EGREGIOUS.

120
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,330
AGAIN ALSO WE
SHOULD SAY WE KNEW THIS WOULD

121
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,330
HAPPEN.

122
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,060
WE KNEW THEY WOULD GET
THIS DONE NO MATTER WHAT, I

123
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,949
DON'T THINK THERE WAS EVER A
DOUBT.

124
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:17,639
EVERY VICTORY FROM THE

125
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,080
NUCLEAR DEAL TO OBAMACARE
PROTECTION TO WHATEVER LITTLE

126
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,850
VICTORIES HAVE HAPPENED IN
CONGRESS JUST BY VIRTUE OF THE

127
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,919
FACT THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T GET
SOMETHING DONE, THIS WE

128
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,509
ALWAYS KNEW WAS SOMETHING THEY
WOULD GET.

129
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:32,199
>>IT ALWAYS GREATLY ANNOYED ME
WHEN RIGHT-WINGERS OR THE

130
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,650
MEDIA WOULD PRETEND THIS
WAS UP IN THE AIR.

131
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,580
IT ISN'T, THIS IS WHAT THEY
GOT PAID FOR, EVERY DONOR

132
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,550
WANTED THIS, THERE WAS NO WAY IT
WASN'T GOING TO GET DONE.

133
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,170
THEY RUN THE COUNTRY.

134
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:51,150
>>RUBIO HAD BEEN SAYING HE WAS
GOING TO HOLD IT UP.

135
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,949
>>I THINK RUBIO IS THE MOST
POORLY ADVISED MEMBER OF THE

136
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,379
U.S. SENATE.

137
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:00,350
EVERY SINGLE TIME
HE HAS A CHANCE TO SET HIMSELF

138
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,349
APART FROM A PACK THAT HE WANTS
TO SET HIMSELF APART FROM

139
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:06,879
IF HE WANTS TO RUN FOR
PRESIDENT, HE DOES THE

140
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,270
OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE SHOULD DO.

141
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:18,939
>>IN ADDITION, CORKER, WHO VOTED
AGAINST THE PREVIOUS SENATE

142
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,780
VERSION OF THE BILL, THE
REPUBLICAN, SAID HE WILL

143
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,870
VOTE FOR THIS.

144
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,930
>>OF COURSE HE WILL, IT WAS ALL
A LIE.

145
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,189
HE CLAIMED HE CARED ABOUT

146
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:30,180
THE $1.5 TRILLION DEFICIT THIS
CREATES, IT STILL CREATES THAT.

147
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,860
HE DOESN'T CARE.

148
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:40,070
>>DO WE KNOW, FLAKE WAS ON THE
SIDE WHEN I LAST HEARD?

149
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,229
AT LEAST

150
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:44,440
SENATOR LUTHER STRANGE, WHO WAS
ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE OF ALABAMA

151
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,870
EXCEPT THAT HE WASN'T, AND
THERE'S A NEW SENATOR WHO WAS,

152
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,290
WILL BE ABLE TO VOTE ON THIS.

153
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,199
BUT GOING BACK TO CORKER,

154
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:55,020
YESTERDAY THERE WAS A POLL OUT
OF TENNESSEE THAT SAID THAT PHIL

155
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:03,560
BREDISON, FORMER MAYOR OF
NASHVILLE, WILL 

156
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
RUNNING INTO

157
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,270
MARSHA BLACKBURN, BREDISON
IS UP BY TWO POINTS.

158
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:11,120
AS SOON AS CORKER SAW THAT, THE
MOMENT I SAW THAT POLE I

159
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,099
SAID WE LOST CORKER NOW, BECAUSE
HE NEEDS TO GET POLITICALLY

160
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:18,129
A TAX CUT TO TENNESSEE THAT HE
DIDN'T STAND IN THE WAY OF

161
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:21,849
SO REPUBLICANS LOOK LIKE THEY
HELPED WITH TAXES, THAT WAS

162
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:23,009
MY FIRST READ IMMEDIATELY.

163
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:27,669
>>WE SHOULD HOPE THEY DON'T SEE
THE DETAILS OF THIS THOUGH.

164
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:29,780
>>THERE WILL LOSE IN TENNESSEE.

165
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,729
THEY WILL LOSE EVERYWHERE, THAT

166
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:34,830
THE SEPARATE CONVERSATION, GREAT
ANALYSIS ON THE POLITICS BY

167
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,530
MICHAEL, BUT THE HEART OF THIS,
DON'T GET ME WRONG, I TOLD YOU

168
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,059
THE TINY LITTLE BIT THAT WAS
SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE

169
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:46,900
HORRIBLE VERSION EARLIER, BUT
THEY MOVED THE OVERTON WINDOW SO

170
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,850
FAR TO THE RIGHT BY TRUMP FIRST
SAYING HE WOULD CUT CORPORATE

171
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,860
TAXES TO 15%, THEN 20, THEN 21,
AND IT SEEMS LIKE, BOY, WHAT

172
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,470
CONCESSIONS.

173
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,220
THEY LOWERED IT
FROM 35 TO 21.

174
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,320
>>THIS IS A HISTORIC TAX CUT FOR
CORPORATIONS.

175
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,700
>>CORPORATIONS RUN THIS COUNTRY,
OKAY?

176
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,700
THOSE ARE NOT OUR

177
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,790
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY ARE THE
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CORPORATE

178
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:19,690
DONORS THAT HAVE TAKEN OVER THE
BODY POLITIC COMPLETELY.

179
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,690
YOU

180
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,890
CAN'T GET RID OF TAXES, WE STILL
NEED SCHOOLS, BRIDGES, WHAT THEY

181
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,920
DO IS THEY SHIFT THE TAXES ON TO
YOU.

182
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,050
THAT'S WHY MICHAEL ASKED

183
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,870
ABOUT THE SUNSET PROVISION,
BECAUSE IN 2017

184
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,790
THEY TAKE AWAY ALL THE BENEFITS
THAT COME TO YOU BUT LEAVE

185
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,640
THE BENEFITS FROM CORPORATIONS.

186
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
>>2027.

187
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,950
>>YES, SORRY, 20 YEARS FROM NOW.

188
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,160
THAT MEETS EVERYONE MAKING UNDER

189
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:51,870
75,000 WILL GET A TAX INCREASE.

190
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,870
AND YOU CAN SEE HOW DISINGENUOUS

191
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,580
THEY ARE WITH ONE EXAMPLE, THE
PASS-THROUGH TAX.

192
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,580
THE

193
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,400
PASS-THROUGH TAX IS A PERFECTLY
GOOD, NORMAL THING, YOUNG TURKS

194
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,080
USED TO BE A PASS-THROUGH
CORPORATION, SO WHAT DOES THAT

195
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,080
MEAN?

196
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,250
IT MEANS IT PASSES THROUGH
AND YOU ONLY GET TAXED ONCE FOR

197
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,550
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE OWNERS OF
THAT PRIVATELY HELD CORPORATION.

198
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,920
THAT'S LOGICAL, THAT IS FINE,
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO

199
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,920
DO CORPORATIONS.

200
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,720
>>EXPLAINED THAT A LITTLE BIT.

201
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,580
>>THE CORPORATION DOESN'T GET
TAXED -- IF YOU ARE NOT AT

202
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,540
PASS-THROUGH, CORPORATE TAXES
USED TO BE 35%, THEN YOU HAVE

203
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,850
YOUR OWN PERSONAL INCOME TAXES.

204
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,370
IF YOU ARE A CORPORATION DOING

205
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,370
GREAT, USED TO PAY 35% AND THE
GUY, WHOEVER IS AT THE END OF

206
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,740
THAT, WILL PAY IN THE OLD DAYS
AROUND 39%.

207
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,740
THAT IS ACTUALLY

208
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,470
DOUBLE TAXATION BUT THERE'S A
GOOD REASON FOR THAT, BECAUSE

209
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,410
THE GUY IS NOT THE SAME THING AS
THE CORPORATION.

210
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,410
BUT IF YOU ARE

211
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,850
A SMALLER BUSINESS, YOU SAY, YOU
KNOW WHAT?

212
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,150
WE DON'T NEED TO TAX

213
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,320
THIS GUY TWICE, BOB IS THE OWNER
OF XYZ PLUMBING.

214
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,680
>>HE'S BASICALLY THE
CORPORATION.

215
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,910
>>HE IS XYZ PLUMBING.

216
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,500
YOU CAN
PASS-THROUGH AND YOU WILL GET

217
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,550
TAXED, BOB WILL GET TAXED, BUT
XYZ PLUMBING WON'T. ITS SINGLE

218
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,550
TAXATION.

219
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,000
WHEN YOU GET LARGER,
YOU AREN'T ALLOWED TO DO THAT,

220
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,110
ETC., BUT IN THIS BILL WHAT THEY
DO IS OKAY, YOU ARE STILL

221
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,420
ALLOWED TO PASS THROUGH, NO ONE
IS DISPUTING THAT, BUT THEN WE

222
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,670
ARE GOING TO LOWER IT.

223
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,720
WHY?

224
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,870
YOU
ARE ONLY GETTING TAXED ONCE

225
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,220
ANYWAY, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO LOWER
IT TO 20%?

226
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,241
IF YOU DO THAT, EVERY

227
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:30,760
RICH PERSON IN THE COUNTRY WILL
GO, 37%?

228
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,190
WE ONLY LOWERED IT TWO

229
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,190
POINTS?

230
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:38,570
I'M NOW THE OWNER OF XYZ
DENTISTRY, XYZ DOCTOR OFFICE,

231
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:43,350
XYZ LEGAL OFFICE, XYZ WHATEVER
THE HELL ELSE I'M GOING TO

232
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,520
PRETEND TO HAVE.

233
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,560
>>XYZ STEAKS.

234
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,240
>>AND THEY WILL ALSO
PASS-THROUGH INCOME AND THE RICH

235
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,010
JUST GOT THEIR TAXES CUT DOWN TO
20%.

236
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,980
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS, THEY TOOK

237
00:11:53,980 --> 00:00:00,000
ALL YOUR MONEY AND GIVE IT TO
THE RICH.
