00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,730
weekdays in which I post very short

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,340
entries about five minutes long and to

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,400
start off this official release I

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,510
thought I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would record today's podcast</font>

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,590
live on this video now so here goes

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,949
nothing hello everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope all is well</font>

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,200
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> miles dire and you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> listening</font>

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,840
to podcast 376 I just come back from

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,649
central London because Sky News invited

12
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,930
me today to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come down to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their studio</font>

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,239
for an interview about a news article

14
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,800
today in which eric schmidt's the head

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,300
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> google had concerns and we express</font>

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,369
concerns in which he believes many many

17
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:07,049
young people are actually people across

18
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,619
the board who use the internet and post

19
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,840
videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> of themselves and express</font>

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,119
themselves openly will actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

21
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,150
change their identity get a new name at

22
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,979
some point in the future due to

23
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,930
embarrassment or the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they may</font>

24
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,960
have ruined their reputation which is

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,920
now online forever and when asked about

26
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,470
this on sky knees i was only interviewed

27
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,079
for about five minutes obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font>

28
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,329
have liked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have longer to express my</font>

29
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,119
views so am a lot of the thoughts<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had</font>

30
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,060
written down beforehand and before<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,159
went on air I've actually kept with me

32
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,189
and I thought I'd express them now but

33
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,420
primarily I'd like to know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

34
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,869
think do you feel being open on the

35
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a good thing d what caution</font>

36
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,439
cautions do you think should be advised

37
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,100
to new users of the internet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you</font>

38
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,579
foresee people in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future getting new</font>

39
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,899
identities because of what they've

40
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,780
posted online previously so you know

41
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,890
comment

42
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,470
with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hughes first and now I'll</font>

43
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,630
explain what I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you disagree</font>

44
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,120
please do let me know why and if you

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,450
agree I'm all the same for me it's about

46
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,120
common sense and what I'm talking about

47
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,720
common sense it's about social etiquette

48
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,600
you know I'm a very open person I'm very

49
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">open person online its broadcast to the</font>

50
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,040
world but I'm very<font color="#E5E5E5"> open in person as</font>

51
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">well I wouldn't go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a nightclub and</font>

52
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,989
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving out my phone number</font>

53
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:44,459
randomly I wouldn't give my bank details

54
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,760
i wouldn't give my home address there's

55
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,989
you know there's you gotta tell you

56
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:52,110
gotta be careful now with children it

57
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,670
might be different who are Neath the

58
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,940
internet and that's about parental

59
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,489
guidance<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean because they aren't out</font>

60
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:02,280
and about and they are only typing words

61
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,440
on the screen or recording video footage

62
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,690
that goes on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet they may not</font>

63
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,330
feel that direct association with giving

64
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,130
a stranger their details so in that

65
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,250
sense yes there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a danger but for me</font>

66
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,280
and how it relates<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me is a video i</font>

67
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,010
post four years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I may express a</font>

68
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,600
particular view but I might think

69
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,420
something different<font color="#CCCCCC"> now now videos are a</font>

70
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,610
snapshot<font color="#E5E5E5"> in time just like photographs</font>

71
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,500
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only difference is that in</font>

72
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,750
videos people are watching a real person

73
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,510
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them and they feel it is in the</font>

74
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,160
present time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again it's about you</font>

75
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,799
know just discretion and using your<font color="#E5E5E5"> head</font>

76
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,720
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I've got a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different haircut</font>

77
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,440
back then or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the video and</font>

78
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,540
you see the date of its original that

79
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,220
where it was originally published the

80
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,130
chances are i may have got a new view by

81
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,829
now and if it was an extreme view which

82
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:03,989
caused<font color="#CCCCCC"> offence people think oh this is</font>

83
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,360
what he's like now you know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

84
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,670
take a step back and rationalize wisely

85
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,459
they could look at the person's official

86
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,340
youtube channel for example and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

87
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,950
ask him directly or see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what their new</font>

88
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,959
content is because there may be some

89
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,548
revelation where they did change their

90
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:23,010
mind but you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is such a wide</font>

91
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,210
spectrum of issues and for me and what I

92
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:27,690
said on

93
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,150
news was if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take meeting up with</font>

94
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,180
people on the internet years ago it was

95
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,680
old they're never going to be who they

96
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,350
say they are pedophiles are out there

97
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,840
etc and the point I make is the media

98
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,860
hype it up with the pur- the most

99
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,050
negative possible outcome and in

100
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,700
overtime they build it up to normality

101
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,910
when actually it's not that bad and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

102
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,680
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google may have it was earlier a</font>

103
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,480
little comment he made but I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

104
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,000
maybe it's put a spin on an issue which

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,310
really isn't that much of a big deal of

106
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,400
course there are people who get death

107
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,760
threats you would have seen me point

108
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,350
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the podcast I just win</font>

109
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,780
it to myself then but you know in life

110
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,850
you have to deal with it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

111
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,090
deal with things and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay online is in</font>

112
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,730
the open where many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are watching</font>

113
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">but there are lots and lots of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

114
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet anyway so it's all</font>

115
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,060
saturated and it's all relative and on

116
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,560
that note<font color="#CCCCCC"> I must end because my five</font>

117
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,860
