00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
hi guys so today's challenge was to be a

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,620
secret be kind ninja of you know Joyce

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,180
wedding you know you get those days

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,589
sometimes when you wake up and you can I

5
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,910
just feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this you don't really</font>

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to talk to one you certainly don't</font>

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to think about doing anything</font>

8
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,079
productive in the slightest everything

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,789
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of overwhelming for no particular</font>

10
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,890
reason I woke<font color="#E5E5E5"> up feeling like that and i</font>

11
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,390
read the challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> day and i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to say</font>

12
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost audibly groaned because i</font>

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,990
didn't want to think about anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

14
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,730
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted to drown my melancholy</font>

15
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,650
and sit around watching old episodes of

16
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,269
West Wing as usual maybe a couple of

17
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,070
wear watches of easy a but not the other

18
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,809
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of person who really hates feeling</font>

19
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,520
like she's failed things even if those

20
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,050
things are Tigers of challenges so I

21
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,670
sucked it up and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> bought some chocolate</font>

22
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,020
bars and<font color="#E5E5E5"> spreads and joy with some</font>

23
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,399
chocolate bars through some metal boxes

24
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,920
of people who I I hoped would appreciate

25
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,660
them a bit of a little envelopes and had

26
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,680
their names on them so it wasn't

27
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything huge or particularly original</font>

28
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,500
or anything but I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it really a</font>

29
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,670
few people stay a little bit brighter

30
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there were people who I know who</font>

31
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:53,460
have recently been having those kinds of

32
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,710
days like this the least we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do is</font>

33
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,850
look out for each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I know</font>

34
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,079
he said today's challenge kind of plays

35
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">in icing with a book that i've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

36
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,870
reading called the gift by<font color="#CCCCCC"> lewis hide</font>

37
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,520
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sister's actually gave me his</font>

38
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">other book which is called tricksters</font>

39
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,820
make this world and that was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

40
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of years ago something for</font>

41
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,520
Christmas of my birthday<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a really</font>

42
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,290
wonderful book for anyone who's creative

43
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,970
or interest in thinking about creativity

44
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,890
critically in some way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the gift</font>

45
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,450
however he's scrutinizing kind of

46
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,130
commodity culture and the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gift</font>

47
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,659
giving I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> read very far into it</font>

48
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:19,830
so far but some of you might be familiar

49
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,600
with the phrase engine giving which is

50
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,860
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of giving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something but</font>

51
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,479
expecting something in return and we

52
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">generally see that as a bad they where</font>

53
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,479
we give someone gif we expected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay</font>

54
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:28,740
in one<font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and stay in their lives</font>

55
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,600
forever but as Lewis I'd put out once

56
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,549
you've done that it stops becoming a

57
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,770
gift it becomes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it doesn't</font>

58
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,450
become<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing that's in motion and</font>

59
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,320
what you might remember the

60
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,850
circumstances surrounding that gift<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

61
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,740
it might have particular like emotional

62
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,729
importance to you what you're

63
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,320
remembering with the act of<font color="#CCCCCC"> being given</font>

64
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,970
that gift<font color="#E5E5E5"> so anyone really enjoying it</font>

65
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,049
so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of stressing the</font>

66
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,310
importance<font color="#CCCCCC"> of keeping things in motion</font>

67
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,950
and not becoming solid and still as a

68
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,659
person I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kind of my</font>

69
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,100
philosophy at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment keeping things</font>

70
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,930
moving going keep things ticking over

71
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,939
let the great world spin as a well I

72
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,140
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you cling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on to things about</font>

73
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,280
the time you are then should find

74
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,840
yourself empty how did all these sorts

75
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,460
of other ways and it's fun to give gifts

76
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,270
whether those gifts are letters or

77
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,890
as they Frank put it at VidCon this year

78
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're really perfectly constructed</font>

79
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,098
facebook message or something bigger and

80
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:10,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">more tangible like chocolate let me know</font>

81
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:12,430
if any of you guys did you acts of

82
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,319
kindness ninjas today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recommend</font>

83
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,790
becoming a member of The Sisterhood of

84
00:02:15,790 --> 00:00:00,000
the Traveling<font color="#CCCCCC"> pandas it's a thing</font>
