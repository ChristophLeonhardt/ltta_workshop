anyone who is familiar with the self-help world knows who Tony Robbins is even if you're not really into the self-help psychology book and seminar thing you probably know who he is because of pop culture he's kind of a celebrity within that room and he's even made some cameos in movies notably in the Jack Black Gwyneth Paltrow movie I think from the early 2000s called Shallow Hal now he's been making news lately for some not-so-great reasons back in 2016 about 40 people who attended a Tony Robbins seminar in Dallas suffered minor burn injuries after walking across hot coals in what was described as a motivational event now that was really bizarre to me I guess because hello are we in Tibet or Indonesia or something no this was Dallas Texas good ol USA by the way it costs anywhere from six hundred to three thousand dollars to attend his seminars so and if you've got three thousand dollars to spend on a self-help seminar maybe there are more effective or equitable ways of spending your money to fix your props if you've got that kind of money to throw around I will take venmo or Western Union or money order anyway he is back in the news again as many are excoriating him for his misunderstanding or maybe more accurately insensitivity to the hashtag me to movement in a seminar here in California last month he said that women coming out and announcing their victimhood in the wake of the me2 movement were trying to gain significance and we've got a clip for you here that the organization now this posted online on Friday to try to get significant certainty by attacking the show basically is a drug called significant yourself the woman in the clip nanine McCool called Tony Robbins out after he praised hotel mogul and casino magnate Steve Wynn who has since resigned his position as chairman and chief executive after being accused of sexual misconduct anyway vice which used to offer varying points of view but has since turned into a very left-wing site they reached out to miss McCool over the phone and she offered these comments what I heard him say was hashtag me too is great and all but it's being used by all these women who don't want to deal with their own problems and they think being a victim is a way to work out their pain by making their perpetrators suffer and that doesn't help them it happened years ago and they need to let it go all right so here are my thoughts on this and then I want to know what you guys think all right while there are many women within this nitu movement who have legitimate complaints there are certainly many instances of people using this movement as a means of gaining exposure or sympathy or even fame and as we have seen with this movement many of the women coming out are making these types of allegations from literally decades ago especially in Hollywood and I am sorry to say this is probably going to seem very insensitive to some people I'm sure but the thought always crosses my mind that many of these women sacrifice their own integrity at the time and kept quiet so that they could move higher up the ladder in Hollywood or whatever their respective career or field was they didn't say anything then and are possibly now only saying something because they had a cushy and well-paying and established career now I realized that is not the case across the board I absolutely acknowledge that but perhaps these instances that I'm talking about are also the instances that Tony Robbins was referring to who knows or maybe he's just an insensitive jerk what do you guys think comment below and let us know thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebel subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com
