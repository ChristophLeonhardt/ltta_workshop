00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,279
Hillary Clinton's not yet formally
released memoir making headlines already

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,389
today for something she says about her
opponent in the Democratic presidential

3
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:15,480
primary campaign senator Bernie Sanders
here's an excerpt from the book titled

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,300
what happened he isn't a Democrat that's
not a spear that's what he says he

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,619
didn't get into the race to make sure a
Democrat won the White House he got in

6
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,800
to disrupt the Democratic Party I am
proud to be a Democrat and I wish Bernie

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,260
was too let's get back to our panel and
Brianna you've read these excerpts at

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,760
the book I think is formally released
next week but already this is causing

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,200
quite a stir she's in effect saying you
know Bernie Sanders he's not a Democrat

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,730
and she's in effect also saying he's
partly responsible for her loss to

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,350
Donald Trump as someone who frequently
complains that some of these candidate

12
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,020
books and now she of course our
political futures behind her I

13
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,840
complained sometimes that these
candidate books should be accompanied by

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,610
a defibrillator because they can be so
whitewashed and boring this may be isn't

15
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,049
that maybe this is going to be really
honest and for that I am very interested

16
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,990
in reading this but at the same time it
speaks to an issue that Hillary Clinton

17
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,020
has had I think we've all seen this
where she struggles sometimes to take

18
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,159
responsibility now we're looking at an
excerpt we need to see the entirety of

19
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,799
the book so this all this evaluation
could change as we see that but she came

20
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,479
in with weaknesses that were completely
self created and for an opponent to

21
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,840
ignore those things to not really run
them you know the emails and in a number

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,140
of things to not really capitalize on
them would have been political

23
00:01:43,140 --> 00:00:00,000
negligence
