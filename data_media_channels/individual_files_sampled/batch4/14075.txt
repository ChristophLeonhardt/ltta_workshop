good morning and welcome to Declassified live first things first everybody want to know if sound in video look okay I know yesterday we had a little problem cut off to a short start with that so need you guys to tell me how we're looking on that front and because we kind of pointless for me to go on and do a show for you if we don't have if we don't have sound in video but a lot of things a lot of things I want of but well Michael Cohen Trump's attorney apparently dropped the tape and he Wow my shirt looks really wild on camera now doesn't it so Trump's attorney Michael Cohen leaked I guess he leaked the tape or he dropped the tape or he did something with a tape of Trump somehow the tape wound up in the hands of hey Jim how are you hey Jim how's the audio for you today I know we got off to a rough start yesterday morning just want to make sure we're not having those same problems today hey from Ireland hey Kath how are you guys so really talking about the Michael Cohen tape so CNN winds up with this tape of Michael Cohen and Donald Trump Donald Trump's former attorney right and the tape is a big nothing the tape is a big nothing it's Trump and Cohen discussing whether or not maybe they'll buy some material from the parent company of the National Enquirer Mary Ann Garcia from San Diego Matthew from Oregon we got Tim in Canada we've got let's see Ireland everybody's in the house yeah so there's big nothing right so you got a let me break down the CNN tape for you because it appears that CNN puts Chris Cuomo in a room like he gets to go on stage and I take him off off the set they lock him in a room where they don't allow him to look at television the internet newspapers Telegraph's from a Morse code machine he's hysterical so you got lanny davis on CNN you've got you've got this Michael : taping in the tape you have the bombshell of a lawyer and a client discussing the perfectly legal purchase of something that they ultimately decide not to legally purchase they don't wanna buy it so what does lanny davis Michael Cohen's attorney Bill Clinton's good buddy what does he go on CNN and say well Trump said a cash payment and that's what drug dealers and mobsters do now look you got to be Sidney Rosa from Sidney Tom from Missouri yeah a big rally with the president Missouri yesterday Tom I watched it over at the veteran the Foreign Wars was a lot of fun Melbourne Australia Ontario Canada you guys are awesome all right so you got this tape right so you got this this perfectly legal transaction so lanny davis now remember that he was Clinton's guy he's clinton's a lawyer and confidant and closest friend at the time bill clinton this is what the irony of this is so rich at the time back in 1990's dollars that bill clinton paid off paula jones 850 grand to settle sexual abuse claims nearly a million bucks Trump hasn't paid anybody very like that they were gonna buy the rights to some footage to squash the story to make it a dead story but it never happened so in the tape Trump accessibility that it contains a cache well Lenny Davis says that's what drug dealers and mobsters do Chris Paul moles are cash oh my god you've got to be a moron to not understand what that means if you've ever engaged in any business not even mean business business I mean if you've ever walked into a car dealership to buy a new car the salesman says hey is this a cash deal lease or a finance a cash cash deal just means you're paying upfront in one lump sum payment by check or wire transfer I mean the entire analysis of the Cohan tape on CNN was just dumb it was just dumb they go through this entire recording and they're gonna set up companies under which to purchase so they're gonna do all of these things to make the transaction perfectly legal they're gonna spend all this money to make it perfectly legal and then at the final step they're gonna bring in a duffel bag with dollars in is so dumb it's just stupid - deal clearly means a lump sum payment you're ready check your wire the money so idiotic it's so idiotic it defies logic but that's that is CNN look I love I love that Trump waived privilege on these tapes I love that Trump said to the government and a Michael Cohen release them yeah release them because there's nothing on them there's nothing on them CNN is running a headline about what really is that forget that I'm a trump supporter right forget that I'm a Republican forget that I'm a conservative forget that I backed this administration this is a guy this was about the boring conversation I've ever heard having done business it doesn't get any dumber than this doesn't get any dumber than this and it doesn't get any more boring than this home it will buy something yeah if we did buy it how would we go about structuring the deal here's what we're gonna do it we're gonna do cash we're gonna finance well I set up funding with some people from the organization and let's not even bother all right by you know talk to you tomorrow I mean that's really the crux of the tape that really did I read a summary of the tape it is so stupid but of course it's headline news prosecutors have 12 Cohen tapes I wish prosecutors had 1,200 Cohen tapes because something tells me this is the one that was released this is the one that played on CNN which means that the 11 others are even more boring or even more innocuous or even more irrelevant to anything nothing to do with Russia nothing to do with any crime committed this is just idiotic stupid as stupid as it gets as dumb as it gets as dumb as it gets so now what's the new narrative well do narrative is Trump lied about wanting to pay a playboy model who cares who cares I don't care if Trump hooked up with stormy Daniels I don't care if Trump wanted to buy a playboy tape the US GDP is it like it for we had we saw a 4.3 percent GDP increase there's a whisper number of five percent North Korea is dismantling nuke sites the world is safer less tax money is being taken out of our who cares if a billionaire wanted to buy some freaking porn star out I don't care nobody cares look this shows you how how hysterical Democrats are they've got nothing going into the midterms nothing nothing they've got nothing at all what are they better than that would they have a legal immigration Acacio cortes terrorism raising taxes Democrats a platform reads like like the worst episode of Jeopardy ever we've got the categories are terrorism raising your taxes Alexandria Acacio Cortes abolish ice and eliminate boarders I'll take a lemonade borders for 800 Alex I mean this is it's terrible it is they've got nothing so they're dropping recordings between lawyers and clients look I don't care who you are I don't care who you are at the end of the day in America and I assume around the world you're an economic vote you're an economic voter you care about your bottom line I say it on this show on others all the time money safety family if your family's doing better if you've got more money in your pocket and you and your family are safe you're happy you're happy you don't care about let me have alexandria kasnia court has a democratic socialism for 600 Alex what is your a moron I mean this is ridiculous for CNN the New York Daily News laid off 50% of its staff you know why oh you see the left-wing media if you're out there on social media you see the left-wing media it's it's uh Dressen Leslie Sylvan is his ran thing she hates drama Trump was ready to pay cash cash period so what that's not what he meant but even if he dative he had a receipt it's perfectly legal on a bill it says this note is legal tender for all debts public and private so whether you pay by wire by cash or by buy a check it's legal if you want to use a duffel bag again nobody would it's legal there's nothing there did this week people don't adjust that you for you my audience gets it but the left doesn't understand understand this is this dumb it is dumb they've got no platform they've got nothing nothing to run on so this is what we're gonna see a lot of a lot of smears a lot of innuendo a lot of dredging up stuff no one cares about it you know what it's like what a bar or a restaurant is doing really really badly and they're in their death throes like those final two weeks and then they start throwing all these weird promotions like it's Asian over 75 senior singles I like they're just they're just grasping it's sad and it's weak and it's pathetic that's what's going on with the Democratic Party that's what's going on with the Democratic Party they've got nothing they've got nothing and it's it's just oh my god you watch this stuff and and I'm like now let's talk about CNN for a second because they're the ones who released it CNN needs to finally stop promoting the illusion that they're hard news that they're hard news that's what they need to do CNN is biased opinion commentary look I bring you facts but I admit to you every day I am a right-wing opinion commentator I'm not a news guy all right it's not a teleprompter in front of me where I read the news yeah I don't do that you know there was a car accident on i-95 today two people were seriously injured and taken to the hospital the director the home Florida Highway Patrol said X I don't do that I don't do that I give you my opinion through the lens on the right I don't try to make believe I don't try to make believe that on this hard news commentator but CNN does CNN does and and I need I mean I I truly am worried about Chris Cuomo Cuomo's mental well-being I mean I seriously think they've locked this guy in a room he doesn't even understand anything about anything I was just walking my dogs this morning I went to bed I was a little tired last night when sleep early and didn't really focus on this Cowan thing it started to break right around the time I was going to sleep and so got a very early this morning about five o'clock and I'm out there walking my dogs about 5:30 I'm reading the Kohen stuff and I'm I'm laughing and I'm I was genuinely like I'm the only guy on the street it's pitch black me and my dogs and I'm laughing to myself turbot Jones thanks for the donation by the way you could be like turbo donate a couple of bucks you see the super chat icon turbo says CNN's new show called Trump versus a wild yeah Trump yeah Trumpy and afraid is it going let's come up with names for Trump shows Trump E and afraid Trump week on the Discovery Channel I don't know where to begin with this I don't so I'm reading this currently I'm like people are like oh my god he was gonna pay he was gonna pay cash he was gonna bake it so what let me it's his money he it's his money I don't care if he wanted a break bearer a garbage truck fully nickels a dump truck full of nickels a tractor trailer full of pennies I don't care nobody cares his money they're his pennies they're his nickels nobody cares it's ridiculous but back to see an answer CNN look I'm a First Amendment guy CNN is free to exist they're free to thrive if people are dumb enough to watch them but they should admit if they don't have news people Jim Acosta needs to admit I am a far left by a commentator who happens to have a seat in White House pressroom I am NOT an objective reporter I am NOT an objective White House correspondent this is ridiculous this is oh my god as Leslie Sullivan is losing her mind retract your misrepresentation of me but he was willing to pay cash all right Leslie I retracted retracted you voted for Trump great yeah okay but I still don't care I was gonna make cash if he was gonna pay my check if he's gonna buy I don't care I don't care nobody cares George Ross says Brian alka-seltzer for brian Stelter you know I go back and forth with Stelter on Twitter all the time and he's never been like I almost feel bad for the guy cause he's so unhinged but he's never really been a jerk to me like he's never been a dick but he he continues to put out these just dumb easily debunked reports and he shows and yell contradict l how are you this morning Jim Kyle Acosta is the rudest person ever in the news he's yeah he's rude but he's very mature when he was over in Helsinki I was 15 you to point because they had already been security cleared and that was thus most secure way and the fastest way to get them around security there was just overwhelming and they so this friend of mine very well-known media figure sitting next to another very well-known media figure from Fox I'm texting with him and he said to me that Acosta pretty much threw a tantrum the entire trip he didn't to wait in lines he was annoyed the bus was crowded he was annoyed that he had to wait for Putin and Trump to come out he was annoyed that he had a way to eat he was annoyed that he had a wait for the bathroom like they said Acosta it was just a whiny complaining little baby the entire time so apparently what you see on what you see in the press room is what you get in real life with Jim Acosta but see what else we got here oh wow you got the comments are coming fast and furiously today in turbo by the way thanks for that question much appreciated my friend it's a good idea let's take turbo Joneses idea and come up with names and from shows let's Trump Trump a fortune trump week on the Discovery Channel Trumpy and afraid I don't know I could go all forged in Trump American Trump errs let's keep on going all right George Watson's opinion on the Toronto shooting yeah let's switch gears there well I think that Faisal Hussein's family came out awfully quick with a statement of fact a Candace Malcolm who does some work for us here at the rebel I had an interesting tweet let me find it she said um let me so she's saying that the the the notification that this guy here she goes Candace tweeted that polished statements tweeted this overnight Candace treated it's at at Candace Malcolm on Twitter she tweeted that polished statement from the Hussein family following the Danforth shooting it was provide by a professional activist associated with the NDP and the National Council of Canadian Muslims the group formerly called care Canada now that's interesting right because care here in the United States real quick Maryanne Garcia thank you for your donation I'll only stop I'm doing for those paying viewers and Maryanne says what Trump did prior to this election is not my business how I feel nor is it mine couldn't care less Maryanne couldn't care less now back to this shooting so Candice makes a great point so care the council for American Islamic relations had a Canadian chapter care is a really bad group of people I've done some stories on care I get a quite a few in-depth exposé A's my previously a previous show here at the rebel the classified show the recorded show in short care is very close to Hamas care was very close to the family of a 9/11 mastermind and the London subway bombings in New York City subway bombings he was killed by he was killed him Pakistan fighting without Keita in Pakistan this guy his mother his family still lives here in South Florida on property owned by a mosque that's very close to care so care is of closely alignment terror no doubt about that we have many many connections but the statement now what Candice is saying is that the statement about Faisal who's saying being mentally ill he's of course the Greek town the danforth's shooting in Toronto he's the statement was prepared by someone close to care care is close to terror and Candice goes on to tweet the this undermines the legitimacy and claims made in the statement it amounts the political spin not an authoritative piece of the puzzle every claim mental illness psychosis meds need to be independently verified and media should cite the real sources she's right because here you have a guy here you have a guy Marianne rights care the San Diego School District and Mary Ann the acronym is actually C AI R the Council on american-islamic relations there in the San Diego School District they're in too many school districts in my opinion care is a bad bad group of people and I suggest you like the name Faisal Hussain or a similar name comma kills a bunch of people or shoots a bunch of people kills two others and then the immediate the immediate narrative is mental illness it seems to me to be a sanitization of the narrative especially in light of the fact that Canadian authorities didn't want to release his name and I have not seen unless I'm missing it any official statement ruling out terror but man that family and those care representatives sure jumped on it quickly and said not terror mental illness he was off his meds ridiculous absolutely ridiculous absolutely ridiculous so let's go back for the thing as Lesley Sylvan is saying you're in absolutely First Amendment advocates oh am i I don't care about being challenged Lesley but it's clear to anyone who's done business that cash a cash payment does not mean cash in a duffel bag it means a wire transfer or bank check because in the American finance system a wire transfer or a bank check is equivalent to cash at a closing so that's the term used I was in business before I was in media it's a common business term and a finance here a guy like Trump when he said a cash deal that's what he means because they're equivalent if I wire transfer a car dealership money or I go to the bank and get them a certified check it's identical to me giving them a briefcase full of cash bar mail donated to us Bob thank you very much very generous this is a good one it's not the 1990s anymore Trump voters don't care we enjoy winning yes we do barb right on barb excellent comment but that's what cash means let's go back to the Danford shooting in physalis on 1/1 okay I gotta address Leslie's question Leslie sure people can pay off inspectors with cash but they were setting up a company to buy the rights from the National Enquirer you don't go through that trouble and then bring a bag of cash Leslie they were creating a paper trail that's public record on a state's Division of corporations website they were bringing an asset into that corporation thereby increasing its value you don't do that if your intention is if a cash in a bag you got to read and listen to the totality of the situation and deduce from that now it's uh it's go back to the Toronto shooting so I'm always suspect I'm always very concerned when I see a shooting with somebody's clearly a Muslim and the immediate narrative is sanitized because I'm gonna say I'm gonna go on a limb here and say that's what happened in Toronto is that the government held the information backs I didn't want a stereo and now and now we've got Katy boo will die so she loves my voice well thank you Katie Moo thank you very much it's uh typically a little beat up I do this many hours a day so uh it always concerns me when these narratives appear sanitized because I have to ask why why it's some troubling but it's not unique to Canada we see liberal cities do it here in the US we see cities here in the US that do it we sanitize and sanitize narratives there was that moronic referendum before the New York City Council a couple of years back where far left New York City Council people wanted to prevent none of you saw this or heard about this and luckily sanity prevailed the NYPD lost their minds and for those you don't know I spent the first half of my adult life with the NYPD the the new city council wanted to prevent 9-1-1 dispatchers from giving police the race of suspects think about that so you're robbed at gunpoint by a male black you call 911 just robbed at gunpoint by a male black he's running South down Fifth Avenue he just passed 50th Street Midtown Manhattan he's wearing a black hoodie blue jeans and white sneakers he's got a red bandana in his pocket he's carrying a handgun the New York City Police Department well the New York City Council wanted dispatches at the New York City Police Department only give police a man about 5 foot 10 and a black shirt and blue jeans and white sneakers now the New York City Police Department let's say it's a November day and they get there and there are five men in black hoodie black hoodies blue jeans and white sneakers pretty common looking outfit in a city in late fall or winter well think about the unintended consequence of this politically correct stupidity now when you can't give the race the white guy is stopped the gunpoint the asian guy is stopped at gunpoint the indian guy is stopped at gunpoint he you know the hispanic guy is stopped at gunpoint and the african-american guy is stopped at gunpoint so instead of only being the suspect and somebody that matches the suspects description four other perfectly innocent people just going about their day or stop the gunpoint that's the unintended consequence of political correctness ok mem three give us a donation I don't know I agree with you thank you very much by the way Sharia is a better option than today's left I don't know if I agree with you but it's pretty funny point and uh I get I get the point point taken yeah the left is pretty bad the left is pretty bad let's see what else we got here what a star taking some of your comments but uh to finish up yeah I think I think they tried to sanitize the narrative the narrative in in Toronto when they couldn't there now well they try to hide the narrative by not releasing his name I should say and when they couldn't they decided to sanitize it or the family did anyway Matthew Hoffman's off to work see you tomorrow Matt's great to see you every morning let's see yeah Jimmy's forty nine is like van driver in North York was mental also true seems like all of these people all of these terrorists seem to have mental illness seem to have mental illness a lot of calls the free Tommy Robinson yes what happened to Tommy is a travesty but like I tell you every morning that is really as was really doing amazing work on that and so I'm really leaving it up to him on that story he's in touch with the family with people close to Tommy he's in touch with the lawyers as we're going to be going back over there when there's additional information from the court because he's so on top of the story I'm focusing on the u.s. issues with the rebel some of the Canadian issues like the shooter anything that's criminal or anti-terror I'll cover but really as was doing such a great job I would do I would do the story at this service so i really suggest pay attention Ezra's twitter and he shows here on the rebel he has I would say Ezra's got worldwide global there's nobody in media right now with better information on Tommy's casein is row and so that should really he should really be your go-to guy for that story not that I don't want to cover it just he's doing such a great job like I said he's so on top of it I would do it a disservice and so I I follow as Ron it you know we chat offline about what's going on and he he really I truly believe in fact I don't think it's disputable Ezra has the the best insight on the Tommy story of any journalist in the world right now so stick with him for that one evil bastard says the DC City Councilwoman tried to propose that crime surveillance 42 be classified and kept secret I mean if the perpetrators are minorities yeah it's a trend around the country man it is the trend around the country they don't want to put the description out and it really does fly in the face of the Constitution right so a little backstory little education on that mm-hmm and how cops go about doing this here in the US so there was a landmark case Terry the Ohio back in 1964 so you hear the term stop question and frisk the alternative description is a Terry stop and there are so what it means is here in the US we have levels of suspicion levels of probable cause for the police all right mere suspicion doesn't really give you the right to do anything mere suspicion is I'm an officer on patrol in a warehouse district at 3 o'clock in the morning and that's my typical patrol area and the and I know the area and I know that nobody's walking around that area that time of night so I see a guy looking in one of the windows of one of the buildings but it's a warehouse type building machine shop clearly it's on his friends house or his house and I seen him trying the door that's mere suspicion doesn't look right I can approach him in today hey what's going on everything all right and you can say to me I won't talk to you and I could say to him well then you got to be they know I could stand right here on the sidewalk I could say you know what you can you're legally allowed in that but you can't touch that door it's private property or the guy might say hey officer I work here I left my backpack it's got the keys to my house and I locked myself out I'm just looking inside there's usually an overnight security guard I just want to see if he's in there so I can bang on the door okay that makes a little more sense to me and I might say all right let me shine my light in there let me see if we can get them on the phone for you because it's phones hoods backpack that's near suspicion reasonable suspicion is that guy is pulling that door on the side of the building and I noticed he's got a screwdriver and a pry bar in his pocket that's a little more suspicious to me right and I asked him what are you doing here and he says oh my aunt lives around really within while you trying this industrial facilities door and two o'clock in the morning with a pry bar at that point I could ask him some questions and if I see a bulge in his pockets or a shape under his clothing indicative to that of a weapon or if I see those what we'd call burglars tools that pry bar that screwdriver that wrench those could be used as weapons I'm allowed legally to Pat down the outside of his clothing I'm allowed to do that now another reason I'd be able to put hands on him and Pat down the outside of his clothing is if a call came in to 911 gave me a detailed description of him so if a call for example came in a 911 from the apartment building across the street from this warehouse and they said hey look we got a 9-1-1 caller ID and we have another caller we have callback numbers they see this guy he's out of place they know all the employees he's not one he's a male Hispanic five foot ten a gray sweatshirt with a hood blue jeans and black sneakers and they think he's trying to break into the place that gives me automatic reasonable suspicion I can Pat this guy down that's why race is so important in a description to the police because it enables them to automatically raise their probable cause level raise their suspicion level and it enables them to put their hands on someone to detain that person while they conduct a summary investigation this is why it is so stupid when leftists who don't understand this propose these moronic things like hiding security camera footage or taking race out of suspect descriptions because the unintended consequences it actually infringes on the rights of others who might not be involved because now the description is more broad more general so it gives the police more suspects to approach so perfectly innocent people the guy who may very well be the night security guard at this warehouse who also just happens to be wearing a gray sweatshirt and dark pants he's now going to be stopped by the police under suspicion when he he's a perfectly innocent guy just going to work that's why taking race out of the description is moronic that's why now luckily it didn't happen nobody you know cooler heads prevailed and sanity prevailed and it never never happened but that's why it's it's a very stupid policy let's um back some of your questions here but I thought that was in oh you know a lot of people talking about gun control in Canada oh this is an interesting one firuze okati says UK cops always describe the race of a suspect by using IC codes IC one is what euro IC 3 is black what's wrong with that because why do it why bother it why substitute one for the other male black male Hispanic why bother why sanitize it there's nothing wrong with being a male black there's nothing wrong with being a male white there's nothing wrong being a male Asian there's nothing wrong with being a male Hispanic there's nothing wrong with that why do we have to make believe that it's bad to say male Hispanic committed a crime male black committed a crime male white committed a crime keep looking at crimes it's like it's just why add a step when it comes to police response for izzie we should be doing all we can to shorten the response time not lengthen it by adding these unnecessary descriptors that's what I find wrong with that let's see Robert Carr says Isis has claimed he's one of their soldiers in the Sun today meaning Faisal Hussain they claimed responsibility for everybody but I I want to take me seriously I don't want to just say mental illness mental illness let's say mmm how can someone I don't want to get into this queue nonsense that is just the dumbest I've given that idiot enough time on the show hangman John Ruth says my local news which is owned by the New York Times sanitized his descriptions other stations give full description yeah we see that a lot right we we see that a lot crypto sisters please do not promote this queue nonsense it's it's fake its fake so yeah these these news outlets it always infuriates me five are dead in a gang-related shooting huge suspects are under arrest the suspects are described as males 24 and 27 what is wrong with giving us the race they want to sanitize the narrative that's all it's about top space and coffee coffee but be safe out there but non so this is different q I don't know that means Oh Jonathan brain is saying it's a joke oh it's so stupid oh my god oh my god if only I were if only I were an unethical guy and I could spew these conspiracy theories oh how wealthy I'd be I know we're having a little bit of a fuzzy stream problem there my shirt looks Funkadelic huh look at my shirt when the stream goes low-res looks like you guys are on an acid trip it's wild mm-hmm and yeah I don't know I wish we could do something to bump this stream I'm as I'm talking to you guys I'm running a speed test and we've got yet it's trippy isn't it Wow my shirt is incorrect I wish my shirt actually looked like the Hat that is awesome you know it's funny though I only have that in one in one machine and another everything looks pretty good so yeah my shirt is shape-shifting Nigel gave me a donation Thank You Nigel it says free Jeremy Bamber in the UK 33 years of injustice honestly not familiar with the case I typically focus on us-based stories so but it would love to learn more about it let's see uh oh you're talking about Star Trek that Q I'm sorry guys all right my mistake yeah my stream is going a little funky here huh I'm diggin the shirt I might think it's still shot of this and see if I can get this shirt made that is just too much I feel like I'm in a video and like 1983 Oh YouTube no matter what you do to me I'm gonna make lemonade out of lemons I'm gonna make lemonade Allen's hangman hangman John root said John your shirt makes more sense than q.i that was good that was good this is awesome this is oh yes I dudes mask from The Watchmen Robert Jackson said I love that movie people didn't like that movie I thought was a great movie I thought it was a great movie there we go the stream is better but you took my good shirt away now my shirt just looks like a television with rabbit ears from the 1970s can't get the signal this is um anyway a lot of comments about this terrorist in Toronto and yeah it looks like the family is moving to sanitize this narrative listen I'm always torn on that one right because because I don't know if it's because the families radicalized and they don't want the truth to come out or they're just mortified that they the terrorist an alleged terrorist in their family but somebody here is saying let's see you said that so one of the viewers said this Howard G said msn said the family was very religious so ah yeah what's my take on Trudeau taking personal days after a shooting I I don't I'm not a fan of anything Justin Trudeau this I think he tagged it Barack Obama and Bill DeBlasio all rolled into one that's what I think yep and we lost our stream in now they're just making it my shirt looks like it's wool I like the funky shirt better I don't really miss uh Ernie what was the garden in the Jeremy Bamber let me see I don't know this case you gotta be smarter yeah I don't know anywhere near enough about that case I don't know anywhere near enough oh I got funky shirt back I don't know near enough about that case to comment on it but uh so Graham Advan asks is it wrong that attorney-client conversations are on CNN seems wrong to me well Cohen should be disbarred for originally leaking that the tape existed but Trump waived privilege and when Trump waived privilege no it's okay he gave permission for the for the for it to be released psychic from New Zealand says audio is good you sure it's giving me a headache how dare you that's the greatest shirt in the history of shirts this is uh I really you know it's it's so troubling I'm running so I run a speed test and I'm gonna run another and it's telling me that our speed is really really blazing but we always have these streaming problems and I just I don't I just don't understand it I'm gonna run another because I really want to give you guys a high quality show but pardon okay Feroze okati it doesn't make what you're saying doesn't make any sense no I hear you're a you right I hear your answer but an icy code does shorten the description saying I see one instead of white North European over the radio as far easier well what cop would ever say white North European I don't know where he's from male white male white is faster than I see one no white black hoodie blue jeans white sneakers running north on Fifth Avenue he's pretty quick and simple to me I don't care if he's a white North European or a white southern European or a white guy from Oregon or a white guy from Manitoba I don't care white guy he's a white guy nigel is asking me to help Jeremy Bamber in the UK thank you for the donation nasal oh yeah alright that was a good comment hold on who made that somebody said my shirt is strobing worse than Eugene Levy on SCTV that was awesome that was awesome the my clang doesn't hear for the shirt did I am gonna wear I said I almost want the screen to stay a little fuzzy at this point if all my shirts but these patterns could look this good this is gonna be awesome a lot of Popo for say african-american wat white or black one well yeah that's true I never said that male black most departments are ok with that I mean you got it it's about getting there fast MDS if AIESEC Isis claimed responsibility for the Toronto killings last I checked yes don't know if that's changed since I've been here on air but I don't presume it has they take credit even when it's not them hangman John Ruth loves my gift shirt jiffy shirt again my shirt is strobing worse than Eugene Levy on SCTV let's see uh here we go Jonathan Bryan is saying Europeans have different shades of skin tone it's irrelevant for police work if a guy Rob's a story's white he's Hispanic he's you know tan white male white male tan of white male possibly Hispanic a police officer doesn't know someone's ethnicity it's political correctness gun-crazy that's all it is sidekick says Soros has his finger on the internet Killswitch maybe testing before the midterms if he does that he's making my shirt look damn good George Soros is doing me right today he really is oh Jesus this stream is looking better my shirt is not funky anymore Nigel I thank you for the donations but there's not much I can do for Jeremy Bamber raise a little awareness here in the US but the 33 year old case both Robert Spencer and David woods say that Isis doesn't claim jihad that's not theirs I believe I uh Roberts a good guy yeah I trust Robert implicitly so if Spencer is saying that he's skeptical of the ISIS claim I'd listen to Robert on this one he's uh Roberts very knowledgeable I I know him well and he's uh one of my go-to guys quite frankly on these issues so I like this let's see you don't need video even the outstanding only the standing audio my show is great well thank you evil I appreciate that Howard Jesus we're in a holy war we just can't admit it great wait you know I I agree I look at it another way Islam is we're not because we won't acknowledge that they are and so you make a great point you make an excellent point Nigel says every bit counts please brothers and sisters help look Nigel I don't know enough about the case this guy was convicted so I can't advocate for somebody convicted of murder based on and I believe you're a great human being and an incredibly honest person but before on this show or any show I do I would ever advocate on behalf of someone convicted of a double homicide I need to know a lot more about the case because right now they are guilty of murder they were convicted and found guilty of murder maybe it's accurate maybe it isn't but until I know more about the case I can't advocate for them I'll have to dig in too and I promise you I will I'll look into this case this is my subject matter it's in my wheelhouse I'll look into it but I I don't know enough the first time I heard about this case was today when you told me about it in 1985 I was a little kid I knew nothing about this and never even as I are as I can recall maybe us media don't trip says it was more than a double homicide okay even more reason for me to not to not advocate for it renina dose as your shirt is making me cross-eyed sorry now they go to the ophthalmologist how dare you sir my shirt is or ma'am my shirt is beautiful my shirt isn't work of art my shirt made this show today in fact I just have the shirt do the show tomorrow let's see ok compa says aren't the police anything other
