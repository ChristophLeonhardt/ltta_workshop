Yazeed ii fighters reportedly kidnapped and executed 52 civilians from two Iraqi tribes back in June this year the Yazidi czar an ethno-religious group in the country which abide by their own moral code the revelations have emerged in a new report by Human Rights Watch witnesses claimed the Yazidi forces killed men women and children fleeing the fighting between ISIL and government backed forces the victims were from tribes that had reportedly sheltered and helped ISIL militants and we talked to Human Rights Watch activists balkis villi there are two tribes these are Sunni Arab tribes one called Intuit the other jahesh these are famous tribes from the area of Sinjar the historical homeland of the CD's according to the Yazidis these two specific tribes were complicit with Isis and the day that Isis arrived in the area these tribes helped Isis to round up ECB's turn women into sex slaves and to Massacre other members of the Yazidi community since then I have spent much time with you see the elders who told me they had drawn up lists of individuals and of tribes and would target them and kill them if they had the chance heard of incidents where what is now a group of Yazidi fighters a Yazidi militia empowered on the payroll of the Baghdad government that has targeted members of these two tribes but what we we understand is that they're targeting anyone from these tribes women children men not because they were specifically involved in in Isis abuses and abuses against the Yazidis but just be careful because they carry the name of this tribe according to top Iraqi officials in 2014 alone almost 7,000 Yazidi people were kidnapped by ISIL as far as we understand there are 3,000 still missing the man would offer us as gifts in the evenings they would get together and trade the women and have their fun with us yeah it was indescribable funny but I've turned them to endless suffering tears and hunger I couldn't do anything like cry as I soul loses ground in Iraq Volkers villi again says they are lawful killings and torture of tribe members by Yazidi forces are yet another dark chapter for the war-torn country if the aim in these battles against Isis has been to end a horrific cycle of violence and era of violence in Iraq allowing groups of armed actors to target tribes to target women children men who may have had nothing to do with the crimes of Isis with complete impunity allowing them to torture and execute with impunity really will spell disaster for for the next steps in Iraq and any hopes of reconciliation for communities
