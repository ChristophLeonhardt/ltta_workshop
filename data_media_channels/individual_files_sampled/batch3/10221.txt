the deteriorating situation around the last anti-government militant stronghold in Syria Italy province was not heated discussion at the UN Security Council on correspondents Kayla more been in New York and engaged Arnoff in Tehran bring us the latest as the 15-member body that leads the United Nations assembled to discuss the situation in Syria sidled province we heard some rather emotional language coming from representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom there are more babies in it Lib than there are terrorists and I think that should give those engaging in military action pause for thought when Russia and the Assad regime's say they want to counterterrorism they actually mean they want to bomb schools hospitals and homes now the envoy's n ting the Russian Federation tried to give a more even headed and clear picture of the actual situation as the Syrian government is looking to retake control of its province in which there's quite a few terrorists they're trying to minimize civilian casualties this is how the Russian representative explained the situation we are firmly under the impression that our Western partners are stoking hysteria around ad lib and in any way or attempting to prevent the fall of the last major terrorist stronghold in Syria and this is far more geopolitical than this stated humanitarian concerns when nikki Haley representing the United States took the floor she made some rather heated accusations the Assad regime and its enablers Russia and Iran have a playbook for this war first they surround a civilian area next they make the preposterous claim that everyone in the area is a terrorist so every man woman and child becomes a target now the actual situation in Tehran is quite the opposite of what we heard from nikki Haley this is how our correspondent on the ground has described what's being said there the leaders took really more about civilians in rather than anything else really and there was a big big agenda here on the on the line today because well when it comes to terrorists it is pretty much a done deal everyone Iran Syria Turkey and Russia agree that they have to be dealt with that they have to go that Syria should be freed from them but what to do with civilians and how to do it when especially terrorists are using civilians as human shields well that's just there's no easy way around it here's what Russian President Vladimir Putin had to say about this everyone knows that there are a lot of civilians in Italy and we must take that into account the Russian military and the Syrian army have always tried to guarantee the evacuation of civilians according to Russia Iran and Turkey the path forward right now is for terrorists in Italy to put down their weapons effectively this is their second chance they had been already presented with such an offer from the Syrian government but well they ignored it and fled to will this northern Syrian province so now it is their last bastion the Turkish president floated a more radical idea if I may say so that there should be a ceasefire put in place and if we declare a ceasefire this will be a victory for the summit and the most important step in the process will give peace of mind to civilians but Vladimir Putin the Russian president while agreeing that this would be a success he also reiterated that it takes two to tango have a listen the Turkish president is right but we cannot speak the terrorists and the armed opposition they are not here what's complicating things even further is the Menace of a chemical attack the Russian Defense Ministry and the Russian Foreign Ministry both have warned that the al-nusra front that has a 10,000 strong presence in Idlib it's the dominant faction there that they are planning a false flag attack to we'll postpone whatever's coming their way and to remain in control of the of the area as long as possible the UN has confirmed that the two indeed believe that the al-nusra front does have a chemical stockpile in the north of Syria the government on one hand and al-nusra which is an organization declared terrorist by the Security Council are having the capability to produce weaponized chlorine well frankly before the summit it looked like that bloodshed in Italy was inevitable well now there's very very tentative hope that it could be avoided you'll suspect - Richard black a Republican virginia state senator who's just returned for middle if he believes the West is focusing on the wrong problem there's an uplift spirit among the people the terrorists have been driven out of many places and people are looking forward to peace it's not only terrorists that we need to be concerned about the West is concerned about rescuing the terrorists but the Syrians are concerned about rescuing the ordinary people many of these they talk about the families of Isis and the families of Al Qaeda who have gone there but often these are slave these are you zitty and christian women who have been enslaved and and raped and they're simply passed from one jihadist to the other and impregnated these are women who need to be liberated they need to be rescued and the Syrians understand that but the Western press portrays it as though somehow there'll be this terrible event where where civilians are killed history does not show that the Syrian army has caused widespread civilian deaths unlike the situation in Mosul and Raqqa where the Western forces simply did carpet bombing and killed everyone you
