00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:05,628
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS FROM JULY OF 2018, IS SHORT-SIGHTED.

2
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:12,836
OF 2018, IS SHORT-SIGHTED. IT DOESN’T SEEM TO BE SOUND

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:13,169
IT DOESN’T SEEM TO BE SOUND ADVICE.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:22,278
ADVICE. >> MICHAEL FLYNN WILL MAKE HIS

5
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:22,779
>> MICHAEL FLYNN WILL MAKE HIS FIRST HEARING.

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,382
FIRST HEARING. QUOTE THE REPEATED DELAYS IN

7
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,751
QUOTE THE REPEATED DELAYS IN FLYNN’S SENTENCING HAS LED TO

8
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,986
FLYNN’S SENTENCING HAS LED TO SPECULATION THAT PROSECUTORS

9
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:31,388
SPECULATION THAT PROSECUTORS BELIEVE HIS TESTIMONY COULD BE

10
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,989
BELIEVE HIS TESTIMONY COULD BE USEFUL AT SOME FUTURE TRIAL OR

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,791
USEFUL AT SOME FUTURE TRIAL OR THAT THE SENTENCING PROCESS

12
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,826
THAT THE SENTENCING PROCESS MIGHT DISCLOSE SOME ASPECT OF

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,995
MIGHT DISCLOSE SOME ASPECT OF THE INVESTIGATION THAT MUELLER

14
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,331
THE INVESTIGATION THAT MUELLER STILL WISHES TO KEEP SECRET.

15
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:44,268
STILL WISHES TO KEEP SECRET. SO WE HAVE A COURT DATE ON THE

16
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:46,069
SO WE HAVE A COURT DATE ON THE CALENDAR, WHAT WILL WE BE

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,403
CALENDAR, WHAT WILL WE BE EXPECTING?

18
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,439
EXPECTING? >> I THINK THEY WANT TO FIGURE

19
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,576
>> I THINK THEY WANT TO FIGURE OUT WHEN THEY SET THAT

20
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:53,710
OUT WHEN THEY SET THAT SENTENCING DAY.

21
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:58,281
SENTENCING DAY. AND IT COULD MEAN THAT FLYNN

22
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,918
AND IT COULD MEAN THAT FLYNN HANDED OVER SOME INFORMATION.

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,487
HANDED OVER SOME INFORMATION. IF YOU REMEMBER BACK EARLY

24
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:04,988
IF YOU REMEMBER BACK EARLY DECEMBER, WHEN WE SAW THESE

25
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,624
DECEMBER, WHEN WE SAW THESE FINAL CHARGING DOCUMENTS, IT

26
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,127
FINAL CHARGING DOCUMENTS, IT CAME TO THE FACT THAT HE LIED TO

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:10,828
CAME TO THE FACT THAT HE LIED TO THE FBI.

28
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:13,597
THE FBI. BUT A LOT IN HIS PAST THAT WAS

29
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,933
BUT A LOT IN HIS PAST THAT WAS NOT PUT INTO INDICTMENT.

30
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:25,643
NOT PUT INTO INDICTMENT. WE WANT TO SEE WHAT THEY CHARGE

31
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:26,377
WE WANT TO SEE WHAT THEY CHARGE HIM WITH -- IT MIGHT MEAN THEY

32
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:35,953
HIM WITH -- IT MIGHT MEAN THEY HAVE GOTTEN EVERYTHING FROM

33
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:36,253
HAVE GOTTEN EVERYTHING FROM FLYNN.

34
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,588
FLYNN. TO ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT WHO MIGHT

35
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,457
TO ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT WHO MIGHT DIRECTED HIM TO HAVE THOSE

36
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,393
DIRECTED HIM TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE RUSSIAN

37
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:42,826
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR.

38
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:43,961
AMBASSADOR. IT WOULD MAKE SENSE THAT THEY

39
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:54,572
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE THAT THEY WOULD WANT TO GO AHEAD WITH

40
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:54,972
WOULD WANT TO GO AHEAD WITH SENTENCING.

41
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,841
SENTENCING. >> BURSTS OF NEWS THAT HAVE COME

42
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:59,377
>> BURSTS OF NEWS THAT HAVE COME OUT PERIODICALLY, SOMETIMES

43
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:00,878
OUT PERIODICALLY, SOMETIMES COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE SOMETIMES

44
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:03,280
COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE SOMETIMES SURPRISES WITHIN THOSE

45
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:03,648
SURPRISES WITHIN THOSE SURPRISES.

46
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,284
SURPRISES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS COURT DATE

47
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,253
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS COURT DATE FOR MICHAEL FLYNN, HOW MUCH

48
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,253
FOR MICHAEL FLYNN, HOW MUCH CLARITY DO YOU THINK THIS WILL

49
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:14,258
CLARITY DO YOU THINK THIS WILL GIVE US ABOUT WHERE THIS FITS

50
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:14,592
GIVE US ABOUT WHERE THIS FITS INTO IT.

51
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:18,663
INTO IT. >> IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH

52
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:27,071
>> IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH INFORMATION JUDGE SULLIVAN

53
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,206
INFORMATION JUDGE SULLIVAN DEMANDS IN COURT.

54
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:31,509
DEMANDS IN COURT. AND THAT’S FOR ALL OF THE

55
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:33,611
AND THAT’S FOR ALL OF THE REASONS THAT YOU HAVE DISCUSSED.

56
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,713
REASONS THAT YOU HAVE DISCUSSED. BUT IT HURTS THE DEFENDANT IF HE

57
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:38,449
BUT IT HURTS THE DEFENDANT IF HE OR SHE IS SENTENCES TOO EARLY.

58
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,618
OR SHE IS SENTENCES TOO EARLY. IT MEANS PROSECUTORS CAN’T GIVE

59
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:44,589
IT MEANS PROSECUTORS CAN’T GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR ALL OF THEIR

60
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:45,389
THEM CREDIT FOR ALL OF THEIR KOOFGS

61
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:45,790
KOOFGS COOPERATION.

62
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,926
COOPERATION. WE KNOW THAT FLYNN ENGAGED IN A

63
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:50,328
WE KNOW THAT FLYNN ENGAGED IN A LOT MORE MISCONDUCT THAN WHAT HE

64
00:02:50,372 --> 00:02:52,197
LOT MORE MISCONDUCT THAN WHAT HE IS CHARGED WITH.

65
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,332
IS CHARGED WITH. IT IS LIKELY HE HAS EXPLORED

66
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,535
IT IS LIKELY HE HAS EXPLORED WITH PROSECUTORS THE RANGE OF

67
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:57,935
WITH PROSECUTORS THE RANGE OF HIS CONDUCT.

68
00:02:57,946 --> 00:03:00,638
HIS CONDUCT. TO SEE IF THE COOPERATION IS

69
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:02,440
TO SEE IF THE COOPERATION IS VALUABLE ENOUGH SO THEY WON’T

70
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:11,182
VALUABLE ENOUGH SO THEY WON’T CHARGE HIM WITH OTHER COUNTS AND

71
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:13,919
CHARGE HIM WITH OTHER COUNTS AND >> AND BY THE WAY, THE QUOTE

72
00:03:13,929 --> 00:03:15,453
>> AND BY THE WAY, THE QUOTE AGAIN FROM THE ARTICLE ABOUT

73
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:16,855
AGAIN FROM THE ARTICLE ABOUT MICHAEL COHEN AND HIS

74
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:18,423
MICHAEL COHEN AND HIS MOTIVATION, THE IDEA ABOUT

75
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:21,259
MOTIVATION, THE IDEA ABOUT CHANGING THE NARRATIVE HERE, I

76
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,962
CHANGING THE NARRATIVE HERE, I WONDER WHETHER IT IS WITH COHEN

77
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:26,198
WONDER WHETHER IT IS WITH COHEN OR FLYNN, THE ENTIRE QUESTION OF

78
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:28,333
OR FLYNN, THE ENTIRE QUESTION OF RUSSIA AND TRUMP, IS THAT

79
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:30,135
RUSSIA AND TRUMP, IS THAT NARRATIVE CHANGEABLE IN THE

80
00:03:30,145 --> 00:03:31,870
NARRATIVE CHANGEABLE IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION IN ANY

81
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,170
COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION IN ANY WAY.

82
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,672
WAY. >> THE RESULT IS WHAT IS

83
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:35,073
>> THE RESULT IS WHAT IS ULTIMATELY WHAT IS GOING TO

84
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:42,113
ULTIMATELY WHAT IS GOING TO MATTER HERE.

85
00:03:42,157 --> 00:03:43,081
MATTER HERE. SO MANY MACHINATIONS.

86
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:47,586
SO MANY MACHINATIONS. IT SEEMS LIKE AGES AGO THAT

87
00:03:47,596 --> 00:03:49,922
IT SEEMS LIKE AGES AGO THAT MICHAEL FLYNN AGREED TO THIS

88
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:50,255
MICHAEL FLYNN AGREED TO THIS DEAL.

89
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:52,090
DEAL. THIS IS PLAYING OUT, THIS IS

90
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,093
THIS IS PLAYING OUT, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO

91
00:03:55,103 --> 00:03:58,463
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE, THEY ARE STILL

92
00:03:58,473 --> 00:04:00,098
CONTINUE, THEY ARE STILL DELAYING THE SENTENCING.

93
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:01,900
DELAYING THE SENTENCING. PROSECUTORS THAT WANT TO BUY

94
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,269
PROSECUTORS THAT WANT TO BUY MORE TIME.

95
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:06,672
MORE TIME. WE HAVEN’T HAD PRESIDENT TRUMP’S

96
00:04:06,682 --> 00:04:08,373
WE HAVEN’T HAD PRESIDENT TRUMP’S INTERVIEW BEING SCHEDULED.

97
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:11,476
INTERVIEW BEING SCHEDULED. SO THIS IS ALL KIND OF IN THE

98
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:12,911
SO THIS IS ALL KIND OF IN THE COURSE OF A MUCH BROADER THING

99
00:04:12,922 --> 00:04:15,414
COURSE OF A MUCH BROADER THING THAT YOU KNOW, THESE MINUSCULE

100
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:16,682
THAT YOU KNOW, THESE MINUSCULE MOMENTS ARE NOT GOING TO ADD UP

101
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:17,683
MOMENTS ARE NOT GOING TO ADD UP TO A LOT.

102
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:20,018
TO A LOT. >> WE TALK ABOUT FLYNN, WE TALK

RELATED TO MUELLER’S CORE OBLIGATION TO LOOK AT RUSSIAN

OBLIGATION TO LOOK AT RUSSIAN COLLUSION WITH THE TRUMP
