thanks to you at home for joining us this hour in 2016 so the last time we had elections congressman Lee Zeldin was up for re-election for the first time Lee Zeldin a Republican member of Congress from Long Island in New York he had been elected to Congress for the first time in 2014 2014 was an election year that was pretty good for Republicans and that year in 2014 Lee Zeldin had turfed out a Democratic incumbent and and taken that seat in Congress for the Republican Party so he's up for reelection for the first time in 2016 but his district had been Democratic pretty recently he was seen as vulnerable the Republican Party ended up dumping resources into his race you know 2016 was a presidential election year it looked like it might go better for Democrats right Lee's Elden 2016 was definitely on the bubble as to whether or not he was going to be just a one-term congressman but at the apex of that crucial race for him in 2016 congressman Lee's Eldon's campaign did something that was a little hinky especially in retrospect it seems really hinky but even at the time people could tell there was something wrong at the height of that campaign in 2016 Lee's Eldon's campaign sent out a mailer that apparently targeted specific voters in his district and that mailer told voters that they had to mail in their absentee ballots a day after the deadline when those ballots were due oops if voters in Zelda's district had actually followed the instructions on that mailer from their own congressman their vote wouldn't have counted he's telling them to send in their votes a day late well that's terrible right terrible now was that a mistake the Zeldin campaign said of course that was just a mistake but you wonder right I mean we said we see stuff like this we see things like this around the country and lots of different elections right I mean famously in the 2012 presidential election you might remember Maricopa County had a scandal something like this Maricopa County Arizona is the county where more people live in that state than any other County Maricopa County in 2012 put out voter registration information from the county in English and the English language voter registration information listed the correct date for the election that year the county also put out the same document in Spanish it's a Spanish language version of the same document only the spanish-language version gave a date for the election that was actually two days after the election would have been over so that's Maricopa County saying hey english-speaking voters turn up to vote on Election Day hey spanish-speaking voters turn up two days later nice subtle maybe it's just a mistake but this sort of thing seems to happen a lot at least around this time of year right when it when it comes to getting close to a hotly contested election sort of tis the season for these kinds of things this past week a Republican state legislature in Kansas who's supporting Republican candidate Kris Kobach for governor that year this year this Republican state legislature just got ding just got a whole bunch of unfavorable press statewide for a Facebook posting in which he said this quote make sure you know when to vote Republicans vote November 6th Democrats vote November 8th so Republicans vote on Election Day Democrats vote two days after that says Republican Kansas state lawmaker and maybe that's a joke right maybe it's an honest mistake you know maybe it was a printing error or a typo who can tell right these things seem to happen a lot but maybe they're all just innocent when it comes to Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin in New York this time we can tell for sure that it wasn't a mistake because in Lee's Eldon's case after sending out a mailer in his district in 2016 that told people to absentee vote after the deadline had passed he did that in 2016 now in 2018 Lee Zeldin has just done the exact same thing again which is actually sort of making it easy for the local paper in Long Island which is called Newsday they just get to keep writing the same story about Lee Zeldin every couple of years honestly it's almost word-for-word the exact same story like this is the Newsday article on Zeldin when he did this in 2016 it was literally ran this same week two years ago you see the headline there Lee Zeldin mailer gives wrong deadline for absentee ballots quote a Lee's Elden campaign mailer gives voters the wrong date to send in absentee ballots Sheldon's campaign spokeswoman said the mailing was a mistake that's 2016 now it is two years and four days later and here again is the new reporting from that same paper from Newsday I swear they only had to change one word in the headline now instead of Lee Zeldin mailer gives wrong deadline it's Lee's Elton Taylor uses wrong deadline for absentee ballots quote for the second consecutive election a Lee Zeldin campaign mailer has the wrong deadline for voters to return absentee ballots and once again quote Sheldon's campaign said the incorrect date was a mistake quote Sheldon's Democratic opponent Perry Gerson's campaign says the mailers targeted likely Democratic voters in the district such as college students so you know in 2016 you try to pull this off you target democratic-leaning voters in your district and you try to trick them into voting late so their votes won't be counted and you get caught and you say it was a mistake Oh terribly sorry we didn't mean that at all then two years later you pulled the exact same trick it's almost honorable and it's stick-to-itiveness right but the one thing you can't do when you try this for a second time is you can't once again say oops it's a mistake exact same mistake we made last time but that is how Republican congressman Lee Zeldin is trying to hold on to his seat in in New York State in Congress tis the season for this kind of thing but honestly know if you live in that district man think about how it must feel to know that your member of Congress your representative in Washington is trying to get reelected by tricking you into voting on the wrong day so your vote won't count watch your wallet man in that district right this is how he wants to represent you by conning you into maybe screwing up your so it won't count cue evil mustache twirling cartoon villain but he did it once he got away with it in 2016 he's now trying to get away with it again in 2018 presumably if he gets reelected this year he'll keep doing it every two years sorry suckers but that's what time it is right now in politics tis the season for this sort of thing Election Day two weeks from tomorrow I've already started taking more vitamins I've started feeling extra guilty about never going to the gym I'm not not actually going to the gym any more than I was but I am feeling worse about it all the time which is your way of knowing that I'm getting excited this is my way of preparing lots of people all over the country are quite obviously very excited for the election in two weeks and some of that you can see at polling places we'll talk about that in just a second but the level of excitement for the election is actually something that pollsters try to quantify every year as well there's a new NBC Wall Street Journal poll that's just out one of the things they asked in this poll is they ask Americans how strong is your interest in voting this year please tell us on a scale of one to 10 with 10 being the highest how interested are you in voting in this year's elections and I know it seems like sort of an esoteric question but this is one of those questions that they've been asking in this poll for years and years and years and they ask it exactly the same way every year so we can compare different year's election results to the response to that question it turns out to actually be a fairly predictive question and you can see it in past elections this is just looking at elections where we didn't have a presidential race on the ballot so this congressional midterm elections going back the last few this is 2018 last time we had a congressional midterm election was 2014 before that is 2010 before that it was 2006 in 2006 you might remember that ended up being a big Democratic year Democrats took the house in the Senate that year ahead of that election in 2006 this was the response to that question in that poll Democrats showing intense interest in voting that year in 2006 69 percent of Democrats that year said they're interested in voting that year they'd rate a nine or ten on a scale of one to ten and that far outpaced the Republicans who said the same thing the election results followed that very same pattern that was 2006 four years later in 2010 you might remember that was a big Republican year and again that polling question predicted it Republican voters that year much more highly interested in the election than Democrats and the election results followed that same pattern the following year 2014 the next midterm election year that was another good midterm year for the Republicans and again that specific polling question predicted that specific electoral result in 2014 ahead of the 2014 midterms where Republicans did very well Republican voters told this poll that they were much more interested in voting that year than Democrats were and it proved to be true on election day well now here are the results for 2018 tighter than it was in those previous years right this is a closer spread but Democrats are more psyched to vote in this year's elections then Republicans are and Democrats are more psyched to vote in this year's elections than they have been in forever I mean Democrats had a huge year back in 2006 they took both houses of Congress was this big rebuke to george w bush for the iraq war and all the rest of it democrats even that year we're not as excited to vote as they are this year but it's tight republicans are excited too and what that means is that democrats think their chances are pretty good in terms of taking the house maybe right but that pretends a hard-fought election night in two weeks when both sides are excited that means it's going to be probably big turnout it also means both sides have a lot of room to run it also tells you why early vote numbers appear to be breaking records all over the country already we're going to have more on that coming up later on this hour but the combination of very high Democratic enthusiasm for this year's election and lots of people turning out all ready to vote that is more nervous making for Republicans than it is for Democrats when more people vote Democrats tend to do better lower turnout elections tend to favor Republicans so you can see some signs of Republican nervousness and some of the ways that it's manifesting this year are frankly in terms of Republican dirty tricks Seattle Times is reporting now on Republican activists sending out a whole slew of fake ads and fake mailers in Washington State these are conservatives who appear to be mostly funded by a controversial Trump donor in the state of Washington they created a fake progressive PAC that they call themself conscience of the progressives they're not actually progressives it's conservatives who made this pact but under this progressive name they've been sending out mailers to Democratic voters in key districts all over Washington State telling those Democratic voters that their local Democratic candidate isn't really progressive enough isn't really liberal enough and so real Democrats shouldn't vote for that Democratic candidate real Democrats real progressives should instead write in another name and each districts mailer has picked another fairly well-known local Democrat who's run for some other office recently in the past few years as the supposed write-in candidate that real progressives should pick instead of voting for the actual Democrat who's on the ballot so it's clever right this is apparently a fairly expensive campaign these are professional-looking Flyers and ads they're the product of actual local research where they had to pick seemingly plausible alternative candidates to try to undermine the Democrat who's actually on the ballot Seattle Times though has started to pick apart this scheme and they're now seemingly finding evidence of it all over the state this Republican dirty tricks campaign all over Washington State to try to split the Democratic vote and depress the Democratic vote apparently this one is an effort to try to flip the state legislature in Washington or at least to stop Democrats from taking more Republican seats in that legislature I mean hard-fought elections close elections theoretically should bring out the best in everybody right in terms of the campaign's ability just to hustle and and and be efficient and make the most of their resources the competition for under sided voters the race to knock on every door the race to get people to the polls you know the effort to win the argument based on the issues right and I'm sure there are close races around the country this year where that is in fact what is happening in democracy is working the way it ought to but what we are also seeing in these close hard-fought elections is that they're bringing out the worst in terms of trickery and disinformation and vote in efforts and people like congressman Lee Zeldin trying to con their own constituents out of either voting or at least of having their vote counted the remedy to that of course is always the same thing you know know your rights vote don't let anybody stop you from voting help other people in your community to know their rights and to help them vote too right that's always been the remedy for this sort of thing that's what you do in the face of trickery when somebody's trying to con you out of your vote that's the same thing you do in the face of thuggery as well that tries to intimidate you or threaten you from turning out at all in the 2012 election presidential year of course I remember vividly covering these threatening anonymous billboards that went up in low-income predominantly black neighborhoods in the crucial swing state of Ohio we first covered this when these threatening billboards went up in black neighborhoods around Cleveland and it turns out there were dozens of them all over Ohio and cities like Cleveland and Columbus they were all seemingly targeting low-income black neighborhoods quote voter fraud is a felony up to three and a half years and a $10,000 fine you see the big gavel there right you can also see that it's anonymous paid for by a private family foundation in 2012 who started reporting on those billboards in Ohio we later learned that threatening billboards like that were also going up in black neighborhoods and low-income neighborhoods in Wisconsin again seemingly targeting low-income minority neighborhoods in particular in Wisconsin they seem to be up all over Milwaukee eventually there was enough of an outcry over these things over these anonymous threatening billboards and minority communities that made it seem like you might get arrested if you turned up to vote there was enough of a public outcry over these things that the company that controlled the billboards themselves pulled them down in Cleveland the City Council put up billboards in their place that said it is not a crime to vote it is of course illegal to threaten or intimidate anybody out of voting the company that operated those billboards in 2012 said those threatening billboards in particular violated their company's own policy against anonymous political advertising but you know had there not been news coverage of that have there not been a public outcry over that those billboards those threatening warrants would have stayed up through the election in 2012 this year in 2018 we're seeing the same exact kind of blunt threats over voting making it seem like you might be in legal jeopardy if you turn out to vote this year we're not necessarily seeing it on Billboard's we're seeing it online and this year it's not some anonymous donor making these threats this year the threat is from the President of the United States who this weekend posted this on Twitter quote all levels of government and law enforcement are watching carefully for voter fraud including during all caps early voting sheet at your own peril violators will be subject to maximum penalties both civil and criminal really the president is promising maximum penalties in case of prosecutions for any crimes like that the president allowed to get involved in criminal cases like that I mean there is a history of this kind of intimidation and threatening behavior and threatening messaging around voting in our recent past we saw that in 2012 right in Wisconsin and Ohio those threatening billboards there's also of course a rich history of this in our distant past plus or minus the available technology in 1922 somebody flew biplanes over Oklahoma City and dropped leaflets out of planes over black neighborhoods right around election time those leaflets carried a message that was essentially the 1922 version of the president's tweet that voted the leaflets said quote do not attempt to vote unless you are legally registered those cards dropped over black neighborhoods in Oklahoma in 1922 they also had a little illustration next to the text a guy in a hood with the initials KKK written on the hood the Washington Post a few years ago dug up the coverage from the Topeka State Journal at the time of that leaflet drop the way the Topeka State Journal covered it that year in 1922 is with this headline quote scared away from the polls Dateline Oklahoma City August first quote following the dropping of cards from airplanes over the Negro districts Negro voting has been light up to noon in today's primary just it's not like we don't have a rich history of this right a rich and affective history of this as a country targeting specific voters and specific communities that if they dare to turn out to vote they are gonna make maybe get themselves in trouble maybe the law will come down on them it's very threatening it's very dangerous you could find yourself in prison we have a long history of this but this is the time of year when we see it right tis the season we're also now seeing a late-breaking swerve from the Republican Party and from the White House in particular on policy issues that are supposed to cause a whole different kind of fear a whole different kind of fear that they also believe could help them with the election in two weeks and that stories next stay with us hey there are sales from MSNBC thanks for
