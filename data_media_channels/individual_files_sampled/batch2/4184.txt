I said let's get into the details of this NBC News has learned that Trump attorney Michael Cohen is trying to silence adult film star stormy Daniels from speaking out about her quote intimate relationship with Donald Trump according to documents obtained by NBC Cohen got a secret temporary restraining order against Daniels just over a week ago from a private arbitrator the order barred her from disclosing confidential information related to a non-disclosure agreement that was signed in October 2016 Daniels whose real name is Stephanie Clifford filed a lawsuit against the president Tuesday alleging that a non-disclosure agreement she previously signed is invalid because mr. Trump never signed it according to the suit Cohen attempted to intimidate Daniels and quote shut her up by initiating with the lawsuit calls of bogus arbitration hearing against her White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said yesterday an arbitration case against Daniels had been won but did not offer detail she also said as far as she's aware President Trump did not know his lawyer had paid Daniels $130,000 to ensure her silence did the president approve of the payment that was made in October of 2016 by his longtime lawyer and advisor Michael Cohen look the president has addressed these directly and made very well clear that none of these allegations are true this case has already been won in arbitration and anything beyond that I would refer you to the president's outcome outside counsel and did he know about the payment not that I'm aware of you said that there's arbitration that's already been won by whom and when president's personal attorneys and for details on that I would refer you to them a lawyer for stormy Daniels responded to Sanders comments last night on MSNBC it's absolutely bogus it's nonsense any claim by the administration that Donald Trump a won in arbitration is no different than me claiming that I won the Super Bowl a few weeks ago president Trump's attorney Michael Cohen previously has said rumors of a sexual encounter had been vehemently damadam I denied by President Trump and by Miss Clifford who's also known as stormy Daniels so Joe that same attorney for stormy Daniels said yesterday on a different show implying that he didn't want to say yet but that he may have information that could show president from directed mr. Cohen to make this payment Jonathan a lot of people have looked at what Michael Cohen have done especially attorneys that I know discouraged that had looked at the sloppiness of setting up a corporation that could be traced back to their client this agreement that that he drafted what what's your takeaway what red flag raised it's really otherworldly I've never seen anything like this it sort of falls in that category of you know if we keep our eyes closed no one can see us I mean it just doesn't make any any sense at all legally so people can see you if you close just a mature not just more Denari practice but from logic I mean using all these fake names which will be which by the way you then put in parens aka with a line for the real name and it sort of like why are you going through this exercise so he could not Cohen could not have made the situation worse for his client or for himself ultimately none of this is following a trajectory we've seen before even the use of an arbitrator to issue this type of prior restraint doesn't make any sense it doesn't make any sense to say that he wanted arbitration that the other party has never been a party to so we're in a strange area now and this is not going to turn out well for any of the any of the parties in terms of store McDaniel she took a hundred thousand thirty thousand dollars into to stay quiet and so on in terms of Trump not signing it there is still a plausible argument that she has a contractor that's to be fulfilled on the other hand the contract itself is is riddled with problems and so her lawyer has some very good arguments to make in my view that this is not binding including the argument that Cohen himself nullify the agreement I can't imagine also on another side of it Federal Elections laws I can't imagine a congressman or a senator having a personal lawyer pay somebody off a hundred and thirty thousand dollars out of their own pocket before a couple of weeks before their election came about and then I guess Trump still the candidate still hasn't paid back the attorney and I mean speaking of barbecue if somebody gave me a barbecue dinner at a fundraiser we meticulously figured out how much that barbecue was worth and we had to immediately report it to the FEC as an in-kind contribution if you're talking about a hundred and thirty thousand dollars in hush money this does remind you of remind me of Jonathan John Edwards there there are real federal laws here there are a better issue look at this I've said for weeks know that the stormy Daniels issue represents a serious threat if the mauler actually can pursue this issue within his mandate and he can ask the president if he sits down with them about the details of that affair and that is a road that we've seen other politicians go down it has not come out well so the question I have also is the ethical one I tell my students all the time when we go through hypotheticals who are you at this point you know I don't know who Cohen was when he was signing that document was he a friend of the president was he a fixer with it didn't seem like he was a lawyer lawyers don't pay settlements or pay money like this on behalf of clients so who does this oh no one I know of I mean this is like taking yourself a stitch sort of watch it and go wow doing this for someone what are they friends or well that's that's the the odd thing here is that if the situation is even worse because of the report that Cohen said later that he was delayed in paying the money because he couldn't reach the president and then there was a suggestion that he might have complained others that Trump hadn't actually pony up the money so all of that creates a rather target-rich environment for a prosecutor this is it's not a stretch to say that this can be a campaign finance violations I mean it is but as you've already noted someone got indicted for something like this John Edwards Moeller would not be moving too far off as mandate to ask about and we so so Jeremy you say we know that Muller has gone there but we know that Muller is asking questions about Michael Cohen this kind of gets overlooked in the other pursuits of Muller's mana for gates Flynn but how has but there's a lot out there right it's a bit but it does get lost that people who have spoken with the with Muller's team have said recently that Cohen appears to be focused now we don't know whether or not he was asking about stormy Daniels but I think after the developments in the last few days it's safe to assume that he certainly will now really hey you know Casey a Bob Muller is already looking at Michael Cohen we should remind people as part of the Russian investigation deals that may or may not have been made at Trump Tower so his eyes are already on Michael Cohen his eyes may already be on emails of Michael Cohen so this could sort of metastasize into something else if you lay in the stormy Daniels layer on top of it very easily and I mean the thing about we were just talking here about what kind of role did Michael Cohen actually play I mean you can't have a conversation about nearly anything to do with President Trump without talking about Michael Cohen I mean this is somebody who was by his side day in day out if you wandered into Trump Tower any time if you were covering the campaign I mean I was there for the announcement I would cover Trump on the road he was there he knows everything is all of the things Jonathan Charlie that you were saying fixer friend you know behind the scenes cleanup it's I just I do not there's no way that all of his activities are not you know central to all of this and you know I just keep going back to this how is it that we're talking about this this is the President of the United States and I mean legal questions aside I mean the man has an affair with a porn star pays her off and this is not okay like forget make America great again we're gonna need to make America good again because this does not sound like a very good man at all leaving the country Joe mica I'll just say two things about Michael Cohen someone who I have had interactions with over the course of the last decade or so he is - they're two things one he is the ultimate Trump loyalist we know there are lots of loyalists around Donald Trump this is a person who has freely said to journalists and others that he would happily take a bullet for Donald Trump it may be that he is actually about to taking a bullet for Donald Trump and the second thing is that the notion that Michael Cohen I mean the notion that any lawyer is Jonathan Turley just said would go out and write a check on behalf of a client I'm anybody who's had any dealings with lawyers knows how implausible that is let alone 130 thousand dollar check without having discussed it first with his client I mean in this case given Donald Trump's the cheapness let's put it that way there's no way that Michael Cohen didn't went out and wrote one hundred and thirty thousand dollar check on behalf of Donald Trump without having consulted Donald Trump before and before doing so so those are I think you're right Joe I think you know the the john edwards case another case i'm very familiar with they did not have the facts and the end to get a conviction there but this is dangerous territory because it does wrap up for the first of all as a scandal that could bring into the public view if there are photographs that are compromising if those photographs exist they will come out and so there's that element of that tied into the facts that touch on federal election law and then tied into michael cohen who not just on this case but on a variety of other levels related to business dealings of donald trump's overseas it is also himself a target-rich environment so can you explain john hama not that i really want to hear this but what is the potential that there might be photographs how did that come into this conversation well there's a legal document in one in one of the exchanges in these legal documents the the Daniel's team says that part of this this this confidentiality agreement that was struck back in 2016 and and part of the ongoing confidentiality agreement relates to communications between stormy Daniels and Donald Trump under their aliases and one of the things that's pointed to in a very suggestive way is the notion that there are potentially compromising photographs that she might have in her possession her possession again no one knows what that whether a whether they actually exist and although they are pointed to I believe more than once in the document and no one knows what those might be although again having some some if you think about the past of the kind of scandals of this nature a photograph of Donald Trump and stormy Daniels at mar-a-lago would not really follow the category potentially compromising so it has raised among many people to speculation that those photographs might be intimate photographs of the President and mica I will I'll hope as you conjure an image of that I'll try to just urge you not to throw up in your mouth so Willie we you you have to look at the personal side of this the personal of mention of this people who are president the United States and their family members have to deal with so much even under normal circumstances and you look at this and certainly the chaos that this obviously will bring the anyone's personal life and it's hard not to ask whether this is in part part of the drama and part of the chaos that has caused the president the United States to be churning the way he has over the past week well any right-thinking human being would be concerned if there was something like what John's describing possibly going to be thrown out and the public view lay on top of that the to the president of united states that yeah i think that would would concern you i agree i think you know conservative and republican support for this president remains incredibly high although his new numbers will talk about overall high 30s you have to look at this at some point the evidence becomes undeniable that there was an alleged affair that there was an alleged payment that he hasn't allegedly paid back the person who made the payment on his behalf that it allegedly all took place at a week or two before the election how can you say when you look at all these pieces this is fake news this is made-up the media is out to get my President of the United States if you are one of the evangelicals you'll talk you're talking about how can you stand by and watch this and support the man if you if you actually look at all the reporting and you look at all the evidence that's in front of us and you don't believe it boy I think you're living in some other fantasy world well it was that the question that Willie just asked is the same question that every evangelical that I knew and I knew a lot because Southern Baptist my whole life it's the same question they were asking of Democrats in the 1990s but they support Bill Clinton I heard it time and time again this proves that the Democratic Party and Democrats are immoral they they don't care about anything but power mm-hmm it's what I heard every Sunday and every Wednesday night as Democrats blindly stood by Bill Clinton that's now a question of course that Democrats are asking of evangelicals well they're being asked a lot of them at this point because they've really stretched to get to this point but this is this could be tough thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and
