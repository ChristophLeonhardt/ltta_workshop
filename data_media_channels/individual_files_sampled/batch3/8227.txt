ELIZABETH: THE GRANDSON OF NASCAR DRIVER DALE EARNHARDT WILL LOOK TO CONTINUE A FAMILY LEGACY OF PATRIOTISM THIS WEEKEND. HERE NOW WITH HOW HE PLANS TO HONOR THE FAMILIES OF SOLDIERS FALLEN IS JEFFREY EARNHARDT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. HOW ARE YOU? I'M DOING PRETTY GOOD. ELIZABETH: YOU HAVE A BIG RACE ON MONDAY. WHAT WILL BE DIFFERENT ABOUT YOUR CAR ON THIS BIG RACE DAY COMING UP? WE'VE PARTNERED WITH NYLON APPAREL WHO THEY DO A LOT WITH A LOT OF FOUNDATIONS THAT ARE SUPPORTING OUR MILITARY AND EVEN THE ONES, THE PEOPLE WHO SERVED FOR OUR MILITARY AND PAID THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE AND THIS WEEKEND WE PARTNERED WITH ANGELS OF AMERICA'S FALLEN WHO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND GIVE TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF THOSE WHO PAID THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE AND IT'S REALLY TOUCHING WHENEVER YOU SEE THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE CAME OUT THIS WEEKEND AND THEN ALL THE NAMES THAT WE HAVE ON THE HOOD OF OUR CAR FROM THE SOLDIERS, MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE PAID THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE TO SUPPORT OUR COUNTRY AND ALLOW US THE FREEDOM TO LIVE IN AMERICA. ELIZABETH: TO ATTEND RACES LIKE YOURS. WE TALK ABOUT THE SOLDIERS AND THE MEN AND THE WOMEN AND WE DO TRY TO FOCUS ON THE CHILDREN TOO. AND THAT IS SO IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY ON A HOLIDAY WEEKEND LIKE THIS BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY CHILDREN WHO HAVE TO GO THROUGH MILESTONES IN THEIR LIFE WITHOUT THEIR MOTHER OR THEIR FATHER. WHY DO YOU WANT THE ATTENTION TO BE FOCUSED ON THOSE CHILDREN? THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I FEEL YOU DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT UNTIL IT'S BROUGHT TO YOUR ATTENTION, YOU KNOW, AND IT HIT HARD HERE JUST A LITTLE EARLIER TODAY, RIGHT BEFORE PRACTICE, TWO LITTLE CHILDREN, LITTLE BOY AND LITTLE GIRL FROM THE SOLDIER WHO WE HAVE ON THE DOOR OF OUR CAR, THEY'RE AT THE RACE THIS WEEKEND AND THEY'RE TOUCHED BECAUSE WE HAVE THEIR DAD'S NAME ON THE CAR. IT HITS HOME, YOU KNOW. IT'S VERY TOUCHING AND IT'S JUST AN EMOTIONAL WEEKEND. ELIZABETH: WHEN YOU MEET CHILDREN WHO HAVE LOST A PARENT, A FAMILY MEMBER, WHAT DO YOU TYPICALLY SAY TO THEM? THEY LOOK UP TO YOU. YOU'RE A SUPERSTAR. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M THE SUPERSTAR. THEIR FAMILY MEMBER THAT PAID THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE, THEY'RE THE REAL HEROS. I'M JUST VERY FORTUNATE TO TRY AND CONTINUE TO PAY THE RESPECTS AND BRING THEIR ATTENTION TO THEIR NAME. YOU CAN'T EVER PAY ENOUGH RESPECT TO SOMEONE WHO HAS PAID THAT ULTIMATE SACRIFICE AND TO BE ABLE TO TRY AND PUT A SMILE ON THOSE KIDS' FACES MEANS THE WORLD TO ME AND SHOWING THEM THAT PEOPLE STILL RESPECT AND ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT THEIR FATHER OR MOTHER HAVE DONE FOR OUR COUNTRY. ELIZABETH: SO OUR VIEWERS KNOW, THE NAMES OF FALLEN SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN WILL BE ON YOUR HOOD AND OBVIOUSLY ON THE DOOR ALSO OF YOUR RACING CAR BUT NINE LINE APPAREL, AND I THINK THE WEBSITE IS NINELINEFOUNDATION.ORG, THAT WILL STAY PERMANENTLY ON YOUR CAR, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. IS THAT CORRECT? YEAH. SO THEY HAVE A FOUNDATION AS WELL THAT WE'RE GOING TO RAISE MONEY TO-SO WE'RE DONATING A CHECK TO ANGELS OF AMERICA'S FALLEN THIS WEEKEND, A CHECK FOR $15,000. AND THEN ALSO FOR THE NINE LINE FOUNDATION, FOR THE DAYTONA RACE, WE'RE GOING TO RAISE MONEY TO SUPPORT THEIR FOUNDATION AS WELL, WHICH THEY TRY TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THOSE SOLDIERS WHO HAVE CAME BACK FROM DUTY AND ARE JUST NEEDING A HAND UP TO REALLY GET ON THEIR FEET AND PUT THEM IN HOUSING AND PUT THEM IN JOB PLACEMENT. SO REALLY SUPPORTING THOSE TWO BIG FOUNDATIONS. THERE'S TONS OF THEM OUT THERE. I WISH WE COULD DONATE THE WORLD TO. BUT THOSE ARE THE TWO THAT WE'RE WORKING REALLY HEAVY WITH, THEY MEAN A LOT TO ME, THEY MEAN A LOT TO NINE LINE APPAREL AND TYLER MERIT, THE OWNER OF TYLER MERIT, THE OWNER WF TYLER MERIT, THE OWNER WHO IS A VETERAN. IT'S EXCITING TO BE PARTNERED AND TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN KEEPING RECOGNITION TO THOSE WHO FIGHT FOR OUR FREEDOM. ELIZABETH: WE HAVE IT UP ON OUR SCREEN, SO JEFF, WE WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK.
