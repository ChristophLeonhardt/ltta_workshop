1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,331
THE UNITED STATES, HE WILL BE IN

2
00:00:02,332 --> 00:00:03,131
THE EAST WING OF THE WHITE HOUSE

3
00:00:03,132 --> 00:00:06,802
ANY MOMENT, WE'LL GO NOW TO

4
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:07,703
CATHERINE HERRIDGE.

5
00:00:07,704 --> 00:00:09,304
SEVERAL DEVICES FOUND IN NEW

6
00:00:09,305 --> 00:00:12,941
YORK, WASHINGTON, FLORIDA.

7
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:13,742
CATHERINE, WHAT DO YOU HAVE AS

8
00:00:13,743 --> 00:00:14,843
THE LATEST?

9
00:00:14,844 --> 00:00:16,712
>> Reporter: DANA, AS YOU

10
00:00:16,713 --> 00:00:18,714
MENTIONED, WE'VE GOT MULTIPLE

11
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:21,483
SUSPECT DEVICES RECOVERED ACROSS

12
00:00:21,484 --> 00:00:22,417
MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS.

13
00:00:22,418 --> 00:00:24,019
I JUST WANT TO DRAW YOUR

14
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,088
ATTENTION TO THE PHOTO OF THE

15
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:27,890
DEVICE THAT WAS RECOVERED AT

16
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:28,257
CNN.

17
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:30,459
I WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO

18
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,128
A COUPLE OF TELL-TALE SIGNS OF

19
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:34,363
WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT ALWAYS SAYS

20
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:36,331
TO PAY ATTENTION TO ON THESE

21
00:00:36,332 --> 00:00:37,799
SUSPECT PACKAGES.

22
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,534
THE EXCESSIVE POSTAGE.

23
00:00:39,535 --> 00:00:41,770
ALSO, THE EXCESSIVE PACKAGING AS

24
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:42,070
WELL.

25
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:44,773
YOU CAN JUST KIND OF SEE THAT.

26
00:00:44,774 --> 00:00:45,674
YELLOW TAPE.

27
00:00:45,675 --> 00:00:47,175
THEN ALSO WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE

28
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:50,412
AS ALMOST A VERY SIMPLISTIC,

29
00:00:50,413 --> 00:00:53,181
ALMOST EXCESSIVE ADDRESS ON THAT

30
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:53,515
PACKAGE.

31
00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:56,418
IT'S ADDRESSED TO THE FORMER CIA

32
00:00:56,419 --> 00:00:58,887
DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN.

33
00:00:58,888 --> 00:01:01,690
HE IS AN ENDLESS CONTRIBUTOR FOR

34
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:02,691
NBC, NOT CNN.

35
00:01:02,692 --> 00:01:05,427
BUT THE PACKAGE WAS RECOVERED.

36
00:01:05,428 --> 00:01:07,729
AS WE LEARNED EARLIER TODAY, IT

37
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,633
WAS NOT JUST CONTAINING

38
00:01:11,634 --> 00:01:12,868
EXPLOSIVES, BUT ALSO A WHITE

39
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:13,535
POWDER.

40
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:15,938
THEY'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE

41
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:17,205
WHETHER THAT IS SOMETHING

42
00:01:17,206 --> 00:01:18,073
SERIOUS LIKE ANTHRAX.

43
00:01:18,074 --> 00:01:21,610
LET'S LISTEN.

44
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:23,111
>> RESPONDING OFFICERS

45
00:01:23,112 --> 00:01:24,746
IDENTIFIED A DEVICE THAT

46
00:01:24,747 --> 00:01:28,951
APPEARED TO BE A LIVE EXPLOSIVE

47
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:29,284
DEVICE.

48
00:01:29,285 --> 00:01:31,386
THE BOMB SQUAD RESPONDED,

49
00:01:31,387 --> 00:01:33,488
SECURED THE DEVICE AND REMOVED

50
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:34,823
IT FOR INVESTIGATION.

51
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:36,325
ADDITIONALLY THERE WAS AN

52
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:37,893
ENVELOPE CONTAINING WHITE POWDER

53
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:39,494
THAT WAS DISCOVERED AS PART OF

54
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:41,029
THAT ORIGINAL PACKAGING.

55
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,931
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF

56
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:44,533
INVESTIGATING THAT RIGHT NOW.

57
00:01:44,534 --> 00:01:47,436
>> Reporter: IT MADE HEADLINES,

58
00:01:47,437 --> 00:01:48,971
OFFICIALS CONFIRMING THAT THERE

59
00:01:48,972 --> 00:01:51,239
WERE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE

60
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,876
DEVICE THAT WAS RECOVERED IN

61
00:01:54,877 --> 00:01:55,711
CHAPPAQUA, NEW YORK, AS WELL AS

62
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,212
THE DEVICE SENT TO FORMER

63
00:01:57,213 --> 00:01:59,314
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA AT HIS

64
00:01:59,315 --> 00:02:00,449
RESIDENCE HERE IN WASHINGTON,

65
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:00,716
D.C.

66
00:02:00,717 --> 00:02:02,818
AS YOU'VE EMPHASIZED, THESE

67
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:04,519
DEVICES WERE INTERCEPTED BY THE

68
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,656
SECRET SERVICE SCREENING OF

69
00:02:07,657 --> 00:02:07,956
MAIL.

70
00:02:07,957 --> 00:02:10,125
THAT'S ROUTINE.

71
00:02:10,126 --> 00:02:12,427
SO IT NEVER REACHED THE

72
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:13,061
RESIDENCE IN QUESTION.

73
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:14,596
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE

74
00:02:14,597 --> 00:02:15,831
INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE TARGETED,

75
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:17,833
THEY WERE TARGETED BY THE SAME

76
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,901
PERSON OR PERSONS IS THAT THEY

77
00:02:19,902 --> 00:02:21,703
ARE HIGH PROFILE DEMOCRATS.

78
00:02:21,704 --> 00:02:23,572
BUT WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MORE

79
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:25,507
ABOUT WHETHER THERE WAS ANY KIND

80
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:27,109
OF POLITICAL MOTIVATION.

81
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,577
BUT AT THE NEWS CONFERENCE

82
00:02:28,578 --> 00:02:30,912
EARLIER TODAY, THEY TALKED ABOUT

83
00:02:30,913 --> 00:02:32,914
TERRORISM, WHICH IS AN ACT OF

84
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:35,917
VIOLENCE TO PROMOTE POLITICAL.

85
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:38,320
AND THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE

86
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:39,621
TENSE ENVIRONMENT LEADING UP TO

87
00:02:39,622 --> 00:02:42,057
THE MIDTERMS.

88
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:43,025
LET'S LISTEN.

89
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:45,427
>> THIS IS A POLITICAL YEAR.

90
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:47,429
IT'S A POLITICAL SEASON.

91
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,333
WE ARE WEEKS FROM AN ELECTION.

92
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:54,302
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY IN THE AIR.

93
00:02:54,303 --> 00:02:56,104
THAT'S AN OBVIOUS FACTOR.

94
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:59,341
KEEPING THE DEBATE AND THE

95
00:02:59,342 --> 00:03:00,976
DIALOGUE CIVIL IS VERY, VERY

96
00:03:00,977 --> 00:03:01,343
IMPORTANT.

97
00:03:01,344 --> 00:03:04,780
AND FOR ELECTED LEADERS WHO IN

98
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:08,917
MANY WAYS SET THE TONE, IT IS

99
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:09,751
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT.

100
00:03:09,752 --> 00:03:11,853
>> Reporter: JUST IN CLOSING,

101
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:13,855
GOVERNOR CUOMO ALSO CONFIRMED

102
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:15,257
LITERALLY IN REAL-TIME DURING

103
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:16,992
THAT NEWS CONFERENCE THAT A

104
00:03:16,993 --> 00:03:18,593
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE HAD ALSO BEEN

105
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:20,328
RECEIVED AT HIS OFFICE AND IT

106
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,229
WAS BEING INVESTIGATED.

107
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,598
HE ADDED THAT HE ANTICIPATED

108
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,033
THAT THERE COULD BE MORE DEVICES

109
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:27,202
IN THE DAYS OR WEEKS AHEAD.

110
00:03:27,203 --> 00:03:28,336
IN OTHER WORDS, THAT HE WAS

111
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:29,738
CONCERNED THIS MAY JUST BE THE

112
00:03:29,739 --> 00:00:00,000
FIRST WAVE OF SOMETHING BIGGER,
