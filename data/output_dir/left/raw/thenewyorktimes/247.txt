1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,710
The snow monkeys of
Japan live further north

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,400
than any other
nonhuman primate.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,960
And one troop has become
downright famous

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,290
because they’re the only
monkeys in the world

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,120
to spend hours in the winter
soaking in hot springs.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,970
Only recently, scientists
have started investigating

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,800
the behavior of the macaques.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,000
But before we get to that,
here’s a brief history

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,790
of how a group of macaques
developed the hot tub habit

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,850
in the first place.

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,150
Macaques live all over Japan.

12
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,910
But this group’s
home is near Nagano,

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,760
where the winter temperatures
are often below freezing,

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,480
but the landscape is sprinkled
with natural hot springs.

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,640
But it wasn’t until 1963,

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,630
so the story goes, that a monkey
first joined human visitors

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,310
in a hotel bathing pool.

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,150
Of course, one macaque in the pool

19
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,550
soon became many macaques,
which upset the humans.

20
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,110
The solution: build a park
and hot spring bathing pools

21
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,670
just for the monkeys.

22
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,520
Happy monkeys, happy humans.

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,560
The macaques soon
became an attraction,

24
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,610
drawing more attention
and more visitors

25
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,780
to the mountains of Nagano.

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,000
Back to the present.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,870
Researchers are now
focusing on why the monkeys bathe.

28
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,280
Probably to stay warm,
but that’s just an assumption.

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,610
Since cold causes stress,
increasing levels of hormones

30
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,470
called glucocorticoids,

31
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,310
scientists tested levels of
these hormones in the monkeys.

32
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,500
They didn’t draw blood
or collect saliva.

33
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,910
They collected and tested feces.

34
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,890
And since the monkeys
are so used to human tourists,

35
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,530
they paid no attention
to the researchers.

36
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,020
As suspected, stress levels
were lower during periods

37
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,760
when the macaques were bathing.

38
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,130
Interestingly, the
higher-ranking females

39
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,820
had more access to the pool
and more time bathing.

40
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,290
Takeshita herself found a kind of
nonscientific inspiration

41
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,460
in the monkey bathing.

42
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,010
Many times after coming
back from the field

43
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,020
I would go
to hot springs.

44
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,360
They also show
how a small group of animals

45
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,050
can develop a unique behavior,
their own kind of culture,

46
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,508
passed down from
generation to generation.

47
00:02:09,508 --> 00:00:00,000
I wonder what they think
about while they soak.
