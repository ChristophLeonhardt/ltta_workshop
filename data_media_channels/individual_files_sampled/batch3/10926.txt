hello I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report the show that dares to go deeper max we're back in New York City and we're gonna talk about the trade war because of course right across from us used to be the World Trade Center it is the place where all trade goes through and it's the center of the u.s. global financial empire but china says bully united states started a trade war the united states has started a trade war and china will defend itself Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Xuan said last week urging the United States to take the gun of tariffs away to smooth the way for talks quote the measures taken are against the interests of China they're against the interests of the United States businesses consumers workers and farmers they are hampering global economic growth they are just a trade bully yeah but you know you got these global trade organizations that are gamed by China and the u.s. gets a short end of the stick so Trump is tearing up the playing board and saying I will start all over from scratch that's the right thing to do we're actually have some analysis on that and by the way I just want you to say that if you want to find analysis that confirms what the Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce said you could tune in to CNBC or MSNBC or fox or CNN there because they're all unanimous that this is a disaster but I'm gonna look at some alternative headlines about the other side of this one from the voter and one from wolf Richter who says well maybe this is leveling the playing field and you've got to protect your own economy at home because for example you know there's something like 26 million cars were sold in China 25 million of them were made in the country because of 25 percent import taxes on cars made overseas so you know if you want to protect your own industrial industry at home you've got to have these but many manufacturing communities feel like they're in a long-running trade war one in which for decades America never fired a shot on their behalf and he's talking about a New Republic article titled the inevitable death of global trade as we know it because as Dan Collins has said for many years on the Kaiser report that we've had a trade war in the trade and the United States has lost wages in us go down because of the financialization of the economy which rewards bankers and Finance ears at the expense of workers and they again I'll say they use global trade organizations and trade institutions to gain for themselves in the case of China at the expense of the US so now the u.s. is simply saying wait a minute let's let's increase wages and let's bring jobs back to the US and China squealing of course but that's the way it goes it's squealing because it it's that old adage if you owe the bank a thousand dollars you're in trouble if you owe the bank ten million dollars they're in trouble and this has proven to be the case is that the u.s. imports so much more than it exports especially with China so China was trying to basically impose equal tariffs on the 200 billion that Trump imposed recently the most recent tariffs and they couldn't find the biggest export from the u.s. to China is garbage literally garbage yeah we're exporting tanker you know China would send over tankers and ships full of stuff and then the US would put all their garbage onto these ships and send them back to China and China would recycle the garbage the cardboard this time there's a woman there who's become the billionaire just recycling American cardboard okay but now they realize that there's not enough stuff that we export to penalise so they have to come to the table and do a deal so back to this article about the voters and why the voters are always going to vote to dismantle the system it's something we've talked about with the US election and also with breaks it if they can kick you in the teeth they will because a common fear expressed by critics of Trump's trade policy is that over time his recklessness risks the end of the global trading system a framework of rules put in place after World War two that they claim have brought about stability and security retaliatory tariffs piled upon tariffs will eventually make those rules irrelevant and at that point the entire system would collapse but that system was inherently unstable as it boosted corporate profits at the expense of millions of workers Trump or no Trump a backlash was inevitable and if the global trading system is to survive as gross imbalances must be corrected right those folks who support those protests member in Geneva against the g7 against the g8 against all these global confab against Bilderberg all those protestors should be supporting Trump because Trump is essentially doing what they want no I don't think that because I don't think it's an individual and I know this is something you and I have always discussed you think leaders are you know somebody that lead people but I think the pits Trump is just a symptom of this trade system that has been in place for 4050 years well 70 years since the end of World War two the same with breaks it it doesn't matter if you've you Max Keiser or me Stacy Herbert thinks it's insane because we live in cities and we travel to New York City and London and Paris and we see all the great benefits of it it doesn't matter because we live in democracies and these people get a vote the ones that got it left out and as this article points out like they kept on being told eventually don't worry just take these losses of jobs we'll retrain you things a little bit get better eventually you know all the jobs sent overseas will be replaced by higher value jobs but everybody now works at McDonald's or some shopping center that's now being kicked out of business by Amazon as I said over decades since World War two the trade policies and organizations put in place had a creeping financialization that disenfranchised the worker who then voted for Trump who's been doing what he was elected to do as the leader of this group of people who were disenfranchised including those who are protesting the g7 Occupy Wall Street it has a champion in Trump sodas breaks it if they're dismantling the system that they've got destroyed by I know you don't like breaks it but I think like if these people want a kick in the teeth of the global order as it was because they lost by whatever the global order was whatever the system was whatever the that the paradigm was they were losing and it was bound if you gave them a vote if you gave these people a right to vote and change that system they were gonna destroy actually you only gave them a vote kind of tinker around the edges and if you but you gave them a vote to like take it all down by voting for somebody like Trump or voting for breaks it they would take it and we'll see how it plays out these two very distinct countries the United States and Britain in the u.s. the deposition or the disposition of the ruling elite will have one effect under Trump and the rise in wages and in the UK getting rid of David Cameron and breaks it we'll see how that plays out but they are gonna have two very distinct outcomes just as the Democrats in America refused to look at the role that Hillary and their own policies played in the loss of the US election both parties I think will if they fail to confront this next paragraph I'm gonna read they will always be kicked in the teeth by the voter the United States lost five million manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2014 while the US trade deficit peeked at nearly six percent of gross domestic product economists like David ohter calls this the China shock because it incurred on a similar timeline as a country's 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization the bounty of cheap Chinese goods had a real human cost here at home you could choose to try to ignore the real human cost who did the Democrats the and the Republicans the two parties that run this country they're united in this policy they have a huge almost violent you know social divisions between the two parties but they're united on these trade policies on NATO on WTO on NAFTA on W on all the trade deals there's no difference not a not a sliver of difference between what the Democrats and Republicans want so the real you know there are real consequences and they could choose to ignore it or not and they'll keep on getting a Trump but there's nothing wrong that's what I'm saying I mean the people put a populist in office like they put Thomas Jefferson in office they put George Washington in office they put Abraham Lincoln in office they put John F Kennedy in office they put Donald Trump in office that's the what's that voters do he's doing what the voters want and the country is better for it I mean that's the way the American system works and the unification of like the likes of Bill Kristol and Hillary Linton United against the voter right now they're focusing at all on the individual that is trunk but really what they're united against is the voter who's upset about these trade policies and the fact that they their livelihoods have been destroyed so yeah the pundits who are wrong their livelihoods are destroyed and all the mainstream media the fake news in America hopefully will get blown out of the water and bring in some real news bringing some competition there is another holy sort of entity here in New York City and that is the stock market all the pundits and all the political elite will agree that the stock markets are America that is the heart and soul of America and this is what we impose around the world and that speaks a different truth to what they are speaking about this trade war stock markets see the u.s. winning the trade war defying corporate lobby and media propaganda since the Trump imposed these tariffs and it keeps them imposing them and all the pundits on television are united against him doing this they're saying he's saying that that this is corporate America's propaganda machine they're getting a lot of airtime on all the networks to say this is grave you know they they keep on having you know manufacturers on television CEO isn't saying this is a horrible thing and Trump is destroying jobs and blah blah blah but chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets researched John Lansky well he looked at the market consequences since Trump impose these tariffs and what he found is that there actually hasn't them been that much impact in US markets in fact they're a little bit up but if you look at China's Shanghai Composite it's down 6.8% since June 14th when you first impose tariffs 14.2% year-to-date Korea's Cosby index is down 5.7 percent since June 14th Germany's DAX down four point seven in japan's nikkei and you know those are the huge surplus nations the markets are saying they're gonna lose not the u.s. so Trump is a freakin genius and everything he said would happen is happening and the professional pundit class is completely wrong and that's thank God Hilary was kept out of office again moody says in their assessment of what this means the fact that these stock markets and the surplus nations overseas have crashed and the US has not they they sum it up as the reasons that moody cited as being behind the markets moves up in the u.s. down in big trade surplus countries are the obvious ones that the markets have been seeing from day one but that the US media are totally and willfully blind to the US has less dependent on exports in these countries in terms of overall business activity the US has a huge trade deficit with these countries and thus imports far more from them than exports to them and any retaliation by those countries would by definition hit those countries far harder than the US the US economy is currently strong and now well outperforms other major economies so you know this is why one must question more because as Wolfe Richter points out when he's watching all the news they are unanimous they all agree that Trump is his trade policies and his tariffs are a disaster let's make the comparison to UK and breaks it versus the US policies versus global trade so Donald Trump goes to the global trading environment with the ability with leverage America's got a leverage in that economy and he can reshape the global economy the UK went against the EU with no leverage they have a zero leverage against the EU therefore they've lost tragically against you and they're kind of being marginalized and isolated as a result of it they completely misstated or misunderstood there the equation between the UK and the EU when it comes to business and trade yes but I do not believe the elite wanted the brexit it's the voter that one of the brexit and that is what is united in these two countries is not as financially literate as the average American voter because America Nouriel country and Britain is is a vassal state of the monarchy it's a very different economy very different population very different country well we got to take a break and when we come back a lot more coming your way welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm max Kaiser time now to go to Galya Bernard see of bank or Galya welcome thank you for having me nice to see you all right now you've just had an event at Bretton Woods and it sounds very exciting but first we wanted to get into this late-breaking news with Bank core of course there was a hack so tell us a little bit about the hack what was stolen and what's going on yeah so it's been an eventful week for Bank or and for the industry at large as most weeks seem to be basically a criminal a thief a hacker was able to access one of the wallets owned by Bank or and to withdraw from their significant amount of cryptocurrency and the initial amount was somewhere around twenty three and a half million dollars worth of tokens and then shortly thereafter we were able to retrieve about ten million dollars worth of the BNT the bank or network token bringing the total to about thirteen million dollars worth of crypto mostly these were ether tokens a few other tokens as well as the B and T which we were able to retrieve now I saw you put out kind of a message to the community that you're trying to get together put together some kind of community effort to attack this type of behavior I saw that on my Twitter stream can you speak about that a little bit yeah absolutely basically the idea is that one projects loss is everyone's loss in this space of course we battle PR in terms of people's confidence in crypto and confidence in the space and of course we've battled the security together as the as the thieves and criminals advance with their technology as the industry advances with our technology and so the idea really is that we're stronger together that they're what we learned from this experience is that there's so much chaos that happens after an incident like this where if all of the parties were better coordinated if there was if you will a hotline if we could share information more transparently if we could be quicker about getting flagged accounts or flagged wallets into the to the exchanges so that they could track those as well we would all be much better off I think that everyone together doesn't want to see criminals win this whole industry though it goes against the idea of cooperating in a lot of ways going all the back to the Bitcoin foundation which was very difficult to sustain because of the infighting that went on and this idea of individual sovereignty is rife throughout the entire industry and its really and I anarchy the idea of anarchy is huge in this industry and it's kind of everyone's on their own so totally - it goes against this idea of trying to put together anything of a cooperating nature because there's a huge fear of any kind of you know organized centralized group at all so how do you fight that under undertow that tenant within this industry that any organization attempt is bad so this is one of those beautifully complex issues and I think that anyone who thinks being alone is better will quickly discover that in order to get where we're going in this industry we're going to have to stick together this doesn't mean necessarily centralized control and this is one of the interesting parts you don't have to be either centralized or decentralized you don't have to be either black or white you don't have to be either on your own or together we can develop third ways we can develop better models for how we coordinate how we collaborate and yet maintain both individual and organizational sovereignty it's not actually that hard to do we just need to build a framework and follow that okay so you mentioned centralized versus decentralized the bank or hack has triggered a debate about decentralization charlie lee / litecoin quote in exchange is not decentralized if it can lose customer funds or if it can freeze customer funds bank or does both so you're responsible we just don't believe that this is true in exchange and a network is decentralized on a number of very as parameters so for example do users own their own wallets and do users maintain custody over their funds at all time in the bank where liquidity network absolutely yes even in a situation like a breach that we experienced last week users were able to access their funds at any time even during the breach withdraw their funds move their funds move to different wallets and so decentralization is is something that you look at on a spectrum and on many many different parameters having some kind of centralized design mechanism does not make a network centralized especially when these mechanisms are transparent are openly discussed are very clearly explained how and if they will be used I think that we can do a better job as an industry looking at what are the best practices for these kinds of centralized emergency mechanisms but just as you know the US or other democracies can call on unique parameters in times of extenuating circumstances in order to affect decision making in a way that might avoid a collateral damage or further damage to the society so can networks and and token networks have mechanisms which allow the designers that are the most interested in the well-being of the network to make quick decisions in a moment of need of course you need great governance around that you need great transparency and that's in fact why we're out and talking to the community as much as we can about both what happened and what we intend to do about it in the future see anytime exchange gets hacked it brings back memories of Mount GOx which is probably an industry's worst nightmare and period and in response to that a lot of decentralized exchanges were talked about and now some are coming online so in the case of Bank or when you talk about a liquidity network this is the kind of a hybrid isn't it because it's not the the liquidity network means that prices are being kind of maintained if you will from an internal mechanism correct prices are being determined by an algorithm which is open-source and transparent and completely predictable and predetermined still demand dictates whether you're moving up along a price curve or down this is what was the vector from which the attack came no this has actually nothing to do with it so let's talk about the security of smart contracts some of the biggest thefts and crypto have come via flaws in the smart contract tell us how and why and how to deliver more security at the smart contract stage yeah so these are very new technologies and their promise is as great as their as their potential vulnerability this is like saying you know in the 90s that email is super vulnerable to Nigerian scams yes it was and that doesn't mean that we didn't continue to get great usage out of email and that doesn't mean that there weren't a few people that fell for those scams I think the important thing to understand here is that the technology is new and to continue asking ourselves why do we want to advance this technology to begin with the mission of Bank or is clear to enable freedom of currency to enable anyone to create a currency and to enable currencies to be freely and openly traded between each other without needing to pay middlemen without needing to pay exorbitant listing fees to exchanges even without needing to match buyers and sellers so that liquidity is not related to volume this actually brings me to two small is beautiful and and the gift that we brought you guys today even lightly traded currencies even small local and community currencies even small project currencies currencies that may begin small and may become very large should be able to be freely and fairly traded amongst those who wish to use them and we believe that the bank or protocol in this open source network is a very significant innovation in allowing us to do this in allowing anyone to create a currency and allowing people to achieve true freedom through the exchange of value between us right so schumacher of course contemporary of keynes right sure and so you're gathering at Bretton Woods of course is war canes from posed a bank or originally rather than the US dollar for a world global trade currency now you may be the only Keynesian in in crypto talk about that a little bit yeah so again we are not kansian we are bank orion and this specific proposal made by keynes at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 was truly brilliant and perhaps there wasn't the kind of political will or courage at the time to adopt such a proposal but times have changed and we think the time is now the proposal specifically made by Keynes called banker and he made it with Schumacher the author of life of small is beautiful basically had two main components one was we cannot allow the global reserve currency to be tied to a specific nation such as the u.s. such as China such as anyone why because the conflict of interest between international and domestic monetary policy is too great for any nation to responsibly manage and the benefit of universal liquidity or global liquidity to that nation whose currency is also the global reserve creates a very very asymmetric landscape and we see this we've seen this play out over the last seventy four years the proposal that Keynes made was to have a supranational currency which wouldn't be owned by any nation of course he didn't have crypto at the time you didn't even have computing but we have been inspired by this proposal and asked ourselves what is the modern version of that that we can apply modern technologies to and what are the benefits so we talked about global reserve currency status to a nation and this would be the same thing whether it was the US China or whether it was a corporation and the other major component of the system that was devised at Bretton Woods which Keynes with his banker proposal proposed the path not taken is this relationship between debtor and nations so when you set up a system that basically says the country in debt is the one responsible to close the trade deficit or to pay back the debt you're setting everyone up in a sense for failure it may not feel that way if you're the creditor nation and everyone owes you but we see this playing out now over decades when everyone is in debt to someone the system cannot thrive so Keynes was seeking to eradicate this huge trade imbalances essentially and and so today what Donald Trump takes a wrecking ball to world trade what you're saying is this is what eventually happens is that without this type of global unit of account you end up with these eventually these blow-ups that we're seeing now in the world trade and we only have like 20 seconds' sure it's just like student debt if you tell all the students that from day one they need to start paying back their debt before they have jobs before they have credibility your shackling them to the debt system forever if you as the university or as the creditor nation say you know what for the next five years I'm gonna pay your debt once you're strong once you're solid then you can start paying it back you might have the version of a much more balanced and healthy system where everyone is actually working together for the sustainability of the whole network all right we gotta leave it there thanks for being on the Kazi thank you thanks for having me all right that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me max guys aren't Stacy ever I'd like to thank our guest Galia Ben Narcy of Bank or if you want to reach us on Twitter its kind of report until next time bye Oh
