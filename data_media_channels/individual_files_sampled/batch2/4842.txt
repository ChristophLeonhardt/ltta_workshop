tell us about your thinking I know we talked earlier today about what this means to America and our values today in 2018 well I think first of all I think ABC you got to applaud ABC for acting quickly the way they did the this is not acceptable in 2018 America you know it's interesting you know slavery is one of our original sins in this country and you know I think all of us are many of us felt like we were moving in the right direction once so Barack Obama had been elected president we said okay an african-american can be President and we are pushing past this original sin but I like many of us didn't realize that there was this variant strain of racism underneath all that who resented the fact that an African American was president and Donald Trump tapped into that and so we what we see now is maybe the last battle of the Civil War but what we're also seeing is that that classic two steps forward one step back and I think what we have I'm glad we're having this conversation but just like the me2 movement things are moving in the right direction and the fact that ABC moved as quickly as they did is gonna is gonna speak volumes now the question is does the commander-in-chief does the President of the United States come out and say that ABC in no uncertain terms ABC did the right thing and that's what we're gonna have to see no more there's good people on both sides no more you know dog whistles and then you know here's my african-american over here we will have to see a president and come out and say that and if he doesn't then it's it's gonna tell us that that who he is is appealing to is a racist base Nancy tell us your thinking on this when you heard the news today and right now well first off I have to applaud Reverend Rob Reiner because he he took us all to church just then and I agree with everything that he said I was shocked and then gratified at how fast how quickly ABC cancelled the show I find it interesting that Roseanne made such a bigoted nasty statement the woman who is most responsible for her show being on the air Channing Dungey who's the head of ABC entertainment is a black woman I mean did she forget that her boss was black or she's so empowered with that bigotry that like the president she thought you know it wouldn't matter and the other thing I just want to throw in but hurt me the most not her show getting canned but the people that work for this show the crew the other cast members these are the people whose names no you know are really little and they go by really quickly in the crawl all of them lost their jobs these are working people working-class people with families and mortgages and her bigotry her racism went so deep she didn't even care about the other people that she was hurting but yeah I'm really I'm gratified at ABC I think they did the right thing and it just horrible Chris well I'm so glad you're on the show Nancy thank you the way you talk about this we're gonna talk a few more minutes congressman cleaver tell us about this you know I just think back the guys I've known in the caucus the Black Caucus and you know such wonderful people like Mickey Leland I love the guy I loved them and their people and I was watching the NBA game last night all those African American guys I just I get sort of inspired by this develop in this country how good it looks like we're getting and then and then this and I wonder this wasn't a dog whistle this was goes back to the primordial hell that we started with in this country at the very beginning this basis of whites are superior to blacks in some sort of genetic way this goes back to the raw seed of the hell that we originally sin yeah yeah this was not a dog whistle this was a burning cross in the yard this there was no confusion about this this statement and the the thing that I think is really really horrible about this whole episode with Miss bar is that she apparently has such little regard for people of color maybe it's us and if OB I'm not sure what it is that she probably thought and believed that she would be applauded and about what she said she may have even wanted some of to come to her from Washington and I think in the absence of that she may have realized not that she was wrong but that she got caught and that she may have to pay for it and I think that's what what her regret for me as an African American and I look at look at her supposedly apologetic tweet and and it means nothing to me it means and what people don't know they hurt people they actually hurt human beings and they can dismiss it and walk away let me get back to Nancy because this is a I say like Rob a surprise it's so horrible but the joke is she called it was the same Joe she told if it's not a joke of course at the same racial/ethnic what she looks like kind of slur she did against Susan Rice that's what is the same reference the same but I'm not gonna use the language but now the same exact joke or I calling it this slur absolutely Center generic generic slur about a race well those were the kind of slurs that were made back when we first arrived in this country as property to dehumanize black people and and you know she has a black character on the show and it makes me wonder I mean she talks a lot about political correctness it makes me wonder why she had that character with this kind of feeling about black people being a combination of Muslims by the way not denigrating Muslims I love Muslims I have friends that are Muslims but to put that together with 1/8 it's just it's totally unacceptable and those kind of images were used against President Obama against Michelle Obama and cartoons and in Twitter and you know it's she's connected enough to Trump for this to me to be just an extension of what goes on with his ilk I thought Rob you responded here's Barry Jarrod herself talking today about President Trump let's watch ya tone does start at the top and we like to look up to our president and feel as though he reflects the values of our country but I also think every individual citizen has a responsibility to and it's up to all of us to push back our government is only going to be as good as we make it be and as Reverend always taught me you have to be people on the inside have to push hard and people on the outside have listen well what are you making this because you really with you know you're a part of history Rob with on the family of course I went a number of different directions and it was fun and and yet it was changing in the country and a lot of the country changed with it and when the humor there was real humor there and there's stuff that we wouldn't do today we're going here but you know but we wouldn't even say today what was on that show this yeah times have changed so well we were making fun of that we were criticizing it we hadn't a character who was pushing a back against that saying this is ignorance this is stupidity this is racism yeah you have in in Roseanne you have a character who embodied that and I said it from the from the get-go ABC was gonna have a lot of problems with her because she was good I knew she was thinking these things I'm just gonna say this listen Trump started his whole political campaign by denigrating Barack Obama and saying he wasn't born in America and that was a race another not not a dog was a lot dog bullhorn you know and so he stirred up that racist base inside and then and it cannot it stand in America today just about the congressman about this because you deal with you know you've got a diverse response was he let me ask you about the history of these kinds of not dog whistles but blatant racist comments you know I don't know how to read it but Howard Cosell which everybody liked in the old days you know his relation Muhammad Ali that teasing relationship was wonderful we all love that the fun of that and then he made his comment about the guy running like a monkey that running back and then you got the comment to me that Greek and they don't have the necessaries we've been through that everybody had a few drinks one day at lunch I think it Duke Siebert's here in DC what do you think of these the the primordial voices not the tricky political stuff but when it comes out what people really think or sound like they think well the two issues here one most people who who say racist things will never even at gunpoint admit that they're racist I mean there is nothing that you can do to convince that them that their race is no matter what there's a woman who said that it's about time we get someone in the White House who looks like a real first lady Wow later in an interview she said long uh traces mean that's the problem in her own heart because she's decided with no evidence that she can present to herself that she's not racist and that's that's the problem that we we have to face in this country the people who are unaware of their own bigotry and in this country people are are going to do everything they can possibly do to avoid any kind of discussion of race on race anyway you know what he's doing oh I think Trump is probably not guilty of racism he just knows how to use it politically the game is something you can't make it a separation yeah you can't say that he's not racist but he knows the game and he's using it politically that makes you a racist Obama ba Carabas white mother from Kansas went over I'm sorry it's Ludacris went over to get to it East Africa had to Kenya to have the baby there so they named him her Brock Hussein Obama yeah and did that with the idea that 35 years later he'd be constitutionally eligible to be President I don't think anybody believes that intellectually Cecil actually Chris about America's Trump and his history of racism he took out full-page ads in the New York Times when those young men were unfairly arrested welding the Wilding controversy even after they were released and and you know found not guilty they were totally innocent he still maintains and stands by the fact that he thought they should go exactly exactly I mean Rob's got a point they were he was trying to punish people just to punish them because he didn't like them yeah but I think it's reaiiy do think an extra three at the bottom of the escalator the first things he said about Mexican Americans you can't the business aunt dog whistling this is loud there are no good at you know fine Nazis and white supremacist what do you you know no it doesn't exist it's what percent of the United States buys this hooks a line and sinker twenty percent I would say twenty in other words it likes what they heard from Roseanne Barr let's just hope it's like funny I would gets lower I would like to believe that it's lower but I I don't know I don't know but here's the thing you know everybody says you know you can't just tar all Trump supporters with the broad nester right Minsky how many is it but wait a minute but there are a chunk of racists and it may be 20 percent it may be 15 30 who knows right but the point is whoever out makes up the rest to that forty percent is okay with that yeah you see what I'm saying Jason is what they are racist I'm only glad about this incident happening for one reason I got your fine voices on today Rob I love having you on the show whenever Nancy thank you so much it's been your last thought Cashman look I just wanted to say Paul Ryan the Speaker of the House after the president made some comments about a Mexican judge he said and I quote this is textbook racism yeah and the problem is that if that's what it is why in the world is that are my colleagues in Congress on the Republican side side hugging him hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on
