39
00:00:58,899 --> 00:00:59,199
THING.

40
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,334
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

41
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:00,801
A GOOD THING?

00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:02,903
TRUMP.

44
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:04,705
WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT THIS

45
00:01:04,705 --> 00:01:05,606

46
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:07,174

00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:20,421
LOOKING OUT FOR OURSELVES.

62
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:21,789
>> NO ONE SHOULD BE

63
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:22,856
SURPRISED BY THIS BECAUSE

64
00:01:22,856 --> 00:01:23,924
DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN ALL

65
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:25,058
OVER THE PLACE ON A LOT OF

66
00:01:25,058 --> 00:01:25,392
ISSUES.

67
00:01:25,392 --> 00:01:27,261
HE HAS BEEN CONSISTENT ON

68
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:27,594
TARIFFS.

69
00:01:27,594 --> 00:01:28,495
SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED HE IS

70
00:01:28,495 --> 00:01:28,796
DOING.

71
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:29,730
THIS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT

72
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,232
I THINK AND WHAT MACRON OR

73
00:01:32,232 --> 00:01:33,434
JUSTIN TRUDEAU THINKS.

74
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:34,401
HE IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE

75
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:35,402
HIS MIND.

76
00:01:35,402 --> 00:01:36,069
>> Neil: DO YOU THIS WITH

77
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:36,670
YOUR FRIENDS.

78
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,138
>> I THINK THIS IS PAT WHO

79
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:39,072
PROMISED TO BRING HIS

80
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,040
BUSINESS STYLE TO THE WHITE

81
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,340
HOUSE.

82
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,242
THIS IS WHERE HE IS MOST

83
00:01:42,242 --> 00:01:42,643
COMFORTABLE.

84
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:44,044
I THINK HE LIKES TO DO.

85
00:01:44,044 --> 00:01:45,212
THIS ONLY PROBLEM HERE IN

86
00:01:45,212 --> 00:01:48,215
SORT OF THE FREQUENT, YOU FREE

87
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:49,016
MARKET YOU CAN WALK AWAY

88
00:01:49,016 --> 00:01:49,983
FROM THE DEAL FIND ANOTHER

89
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:50,951
COMPANY TO DO THE DEAL WITH.

90
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:52,352
YOU CAN'T SAY I'M GOING TO

91
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:53,187
FIND ANOTHER CANADA TO DEAL

92
00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:54,721
WITH RIGHT NOW.

93
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:55,656
THE CHALLENGE HERE IS THIS

94
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:56,790
IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF DEAL

95
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,858
THAT HE IS DOING WITH

96
00:01:57,858 --> 00:01:59,159
COUNTRIES RATHER THAN WITH

97
00:01:59,159 --> 00:01:59,526
COMPANIES.

98
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:01,228
BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S JUST

99
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:03,030
THE WAY HE LIKES TO RUN

100
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,430
THINGS.

101
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,164
>> Neil: HOW ABOUT WE SPREAD

102
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:04,998
OURSELVES TOO THIN?

103
00:02:04,998 --> 00:02:05,899
WE SEEM TO FIGHT WITH

104
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:06,266
EVERYBODY.

105
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:07,134
>> THERE IS ALWAYS THAT ONE

106
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:09,169
PERSON WHO WANTS TO GO AT

107
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:09,536
EVERYBODY.

108
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,272
>> IF THEY HAVE A VALID

109
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:12,573
POINT.

110
00:02:12,573 --> 00:02:13,640
IN FACT, IF THE FAX BACK UP

111
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,875
WHAT HE SAYS.

112
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:15,542
>> Neil: I HAVE LOOKED AT

113
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:16,009
THESE NUMBERS.

114
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:18,378
HE HAS A LOT OF LEGITIMATE

115
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:19,546
BEEFS WITH THESE GUYS.

116
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:20,414
WE ARE ALSO DEALING WITH

117
00:02:20,414 --> 00:02:21,115
CHINA AND NORTH KOREA.

118
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:22,249
GOT TO PICK AND CHOOSE.

119
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:23,217
>> PEOPLE ARE WORRIED THAT

120
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:25,652
WE ARE ISOLATING OURSELVES

121
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:26,320
FROM OUR FRIENDS.

122
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,654
SO MANY OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS

123
00:02:27,654 --> 00:02:29,089
WITH OUR ALLIES COME DOWN TO

124
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:29,923
OUR DEFENSE WITH THEM AND

125
00:02:29,923 --> 00:02:30,824
RELATIONSHIPS THAT WERE

126
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:32,059
FORGED THROUGH COMMON 70S.

127
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:33,761
AND I WILL TELL YOU OUR

128
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:34,595
ALLIES THEY ARE GOING TO BE

129
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:36,597
THERE FOR US WHEN THEY NEED

130
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:36,864
US.

131
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:38,532
THEY ARE GOING TO BE OUR

132
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:40,734
FRIENDS WHEN THEY NEED US.

133
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:41,402
>> Neil: YOU ARE VERY YOUNG

134
00:02:41,402 --> 00:02:42,936
TO BE SO JADED.

135
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:45,372
>> HISTORICALLY TRUE.

136
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:47,141
I'M SURE NOT EVERYONE HAS

137
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:48,809
SEEN EYE TO EYE

138
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:49,243
HISTORICALLY.

139
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:50,210
MAYBE KEEPING UP APPEARANCES

140
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,345
THEY DO IN FRONT OF THE

141
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:52,346
CAMERAS AND BEHIND THE

142
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:52,680
SCENES.

143
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,215
>> NOTHING ANYONE CAN DO TO

144
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:55,549
CHANGE.

145
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:57,351
THIS IS HE GOING TO KEEP

146
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:58,085
TWEETING WHETHER YOU LIKE IT

147
00:02:58,085 --> 00:02:59,186
OR NOT.

148
00:02:59,186 --> 00:03:00,554
>> Neil: I WOULD BE REMISS

149
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:01,388
IN QUESTION MENTION IT

150
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:02,222
FIGHTING OVER THE PEOPLE WHO

151
00:03:02,222 --> 00:03:03,257
COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND

152
00:03:03,257 --> 00:03:04,792
DON'T GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

153
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:05,826
NBA CHAMPIONSHIP OVER THE

154
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:07,428
BASKETBALL ONE?

155
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:08,629
THE PRESIDENT ALREADY HAD

156
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:10,030
THIS TO SAY ABOUT A

157
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,698
POTENTIAL WHITE HOUSE VISIT

158
00:03:10,698 --> 00:03:11,565
FROM THE WINNING TEAM.

159
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:13,133
TAKE A LISTEN.

160
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,336
>> I DIDN'T INVITE LEBRON

161
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:15,636
JAMES.

162
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:18,005
AND I DIDN'T INVITE STEPH

163
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:18,305
CURRY.

164
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:19,707
WE ARE NOT GOING TO INVITE

165
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:20,140
EITHER TEAM.

166
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,475
BUT WE HAVE OTHER TEAMS THAT

167
00:03:21,475 --> 00:03:22,476
ARE COMING.

168
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:23,577
MY ATTITUDE, IF THEY WANT TO

169
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:25,279
BE HERE, IT'S THE GREATEST

170
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,080
PLACE ON EARTH.

171
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,880
I'M HERE.

172
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,881
IF THEY DON'T WANT TO BE

173
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:29,783
HERE, I DON'T WANT THEM.

174
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:30,417
>> Neil: WHAT DO YOU THINK

175
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:30,751
OF THAT?

176
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:32,052
>> YOU KNOW, I AGREE WITH

177
00:03:32,052 --> 00:03:33,754
THE PRESIDENT ON A LOT OF

178
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:34,088
THINGS.

179
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:34,755
HERE I DON'T THINK THE WHOLE

180
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:36,290
TEAM SHOULD BE PENEL

181
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,958
PENALIZED OR PUNISHED JUST

182
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,226
BECAUSE OF A COUPLE PLAYERS.

183
00:03:39,226 --> 00:03:45,032
LAST YEAR WHEN THE ASTROS

184
00:03:45,032 --> 00:03:50,070
WON BELL AND CORE

185
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,571
WON BELL.AND CORE

186
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:53,674
-- JUST BECAUSE HAVE YOU

187
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:56,010
LEBRON AND STEPH CURRY.

188
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,877
BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU DON'T

189
00:03:56,877 --> 00:03:57,878
AGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT

190
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:59,179
DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T

191
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:01,649
RESPECT THE OFFICE OF THE

192
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:02,082
PRESIDENT.

193
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:02,750
>> Neil: HOTS FAULT IS IT.

194
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,084
>> GUILTY BY ASSOCIATION.

195
00:04:04,084 --> 00:04:04,952
MOST OUTSPOKEN PEOPLE ON THE
