>>EACH YEAR, THE AMERICAN
PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION DOES A
SURVEY OF A REPRESENTATIVE
SAMPLE OF AMERICANS TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT STRESSES THEM OUT THE
MOST, IN THIS YEAR THE RESULTS
ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM
PREVIOUS ONES SO I WANTED TO
SHARE THE RESULTS.
THEY FOUND
THAT MOST AMERICANS ARE STRESSED
OUT ABOUT AMERICA.
THE STATE OF
POLITICS AND EVERYTHING THAT
ENTAILS --
>>AND KEEP IN MIND, THEY ARE
TALKING TO A REPRESENTATIVE
SAMPLE, NOT JUST A MILLENNIALS.
THEY ARE HAVING CONVERSATIONS
WITH PEOPLE, OR SURVEYING
PEOPLE, WHO LIVED THROUGH
WORLD WAR II, AND THEY THINK THE
MODERN DAY, TODAY, IS WORSE
THAN IT WAS BACK THEN.
>>AND VIETNAM, AND 9/11,
AND ALL THOSE MOMENTS.
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT
REASONS FOR ALL THAT, WHICH
WE WILL GET INTO.
>>OKAY, SO --
>>IF YOU BREAK DOWN WHAT THEY
MEAN BY THAT, HERE IS WHAT YOU
WILL FIND.
43% ARE RIGHT ABOUT
HEALTHCARE, 35% ABOUT THE
ECONOMY, 30% ARE CONCERNED WITH
TRUST IN GOVERNMENT, CRIMES, AND
TERRORIST ATTACKS.
>>A LOT OF INTERESTING NUMBERS
HERE.
62% ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
MONEY, VERY NORMAL.
61% ABOUT
WORK, NORMAL.
BUT CONCERNED
ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
FUTURE OF THE NATION IS ACTUALLY
HIGHER THAN THEIR CONCERN ABOUT
MONEY OR THEIR JOBS, THAT'S
AMAZING.
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT
BEFORE.
PART OF IT IS BECAUSE
THEY REALIZE, OH, RIGHT, WHAT
GOVERNMENT DOES AFFECT ME.
I
DON'T HAVE HEALTHCARE, I'M
WORRIED THAT SOMEONE IN MY
FAMILY WILL DIE, OR IT'S
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE AND IT'S
KILLING US.
THE PAYMENTS, ETC.
BUT TO ME THE OTHER AMAZING
NUMBER WAS NOT JUST SPECIFIC
THINGS LIKE I'M WORRIED ABOUT
THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE I MIGHT
NOT HAVE HEALTHCARE AND I MIGHT
DIE, THAT'S SPECIFIC AND
UNDERSTANDABLE, THE STATE OF THE
ECONOMY, I MIGHT NOT HAVE A JOB
-- BUT 30% SAID THEY WERE
CONCERNED, AS YOU SAW ON THAT
CHART, ABOUT TRUST IN
GOVERNMENT.
SO THIS IS A THING
THAT PUNDITS ON TV SAID NOBODY
CARES ABOUT, RIGHT?
CAMPAIGN-FINANCE REFORM,
CORRUPTION, THESE ARE MINOR
ISSUES.
NO THEY AREN'T. PEOPLE
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE GETTING
IT, WE DID A POLL IN CALIFORNIA,
THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE WAS MONEY
IN POLITICS.
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CAPTURED
BY THE DONORS, AND AS LONG AS
THE GOVERNMENT AND POLITICIANS
ARE WORKING FOR THAT TINY GROUP
OF RICH PEOPLE WE WILL NEVER GET
ANYTHING.
NOT DECENT HEALTHCARE,
MEDICARE FOR ALL, DECENT WAGES,
AND WE ARE SLOWLY BEING
CRUSHED, AND THAT HAS
DAWNED ON PEOPLE.
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE DEPRESSED
ABOUT IT.
>>AND PEOPLE ARE LAYING AWAKE AT
NIGHT WORRIED ABOUT THESE
THINGS.
IF YOU LOOK AT
DEMOGRAPHICS, THE SURVEY FOUND
THAT WOMEN ARE SUFFERING FROM
HIGHER STRESS LEVELS THAN MEN --
>>THAT'S ANOTHER AMAZING PART
OF THE SURVEY.
TRUMP APPEALS TO
MEN MORE, BUT IT'S AMAZING HOW
IT WORKS ON A MACRO LEVEL.
A LOT
OF GUYS, OF COURSE NOT ALL OF
THEM, OF COURSE THESE ARE GIANT
MACRO LOOKS AT THE COUNTRY, BUT
A LOT OF GUYS VOTED FOR TRUMP,
AND WHEN HE WON THEY ARE LIKE,
THANK GOD WE ARE BACK IN CHARGE.
AND THEIR STRESS LEVELS WENT
DOWN.
AGAIN IT'S AN
OVERGENERALIZATION BUT IT'S IN
THE NUMBERS.
I WAS SURPRISED
BECAUSE I WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT
ECONOMIC ANXIETY AND ALL THE
DIFFERENT ANXIETIES OVERALL
WOULD'VE AFFECTED MEN, BUT
NO, THIS YEAR THEY ARE LIKE,
THINGS ARE A LITTLE BETTER.
AT LEAST SOME PERCENTAGE OF MEN.
>>I'M JUST GUESSING, THIS IS
SPECULATION, BECAUSE THE WOMEN
DON'T GIVE A REASON FOR WHY IT
IS THAT THEIR STRESS LEVELS ARE
HIGHER THAN MEN, BUT MY
SPECULATION IS, THINK ABOUT THE
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS THAT HELP
SINGLE MOTHERS.
THE EQUALITY
ISSUES WE ARE FINALLY SEEING
SOME PROGRESS ON THAT NOW IS
BECOMING MORE OF A REGRESSIVE
THING.
WE ARE SEEING THE COUNTRY
REGRESS IN CERTAIN WAYS WHEN
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
WE DID SEE PROGRESS, AND I THINK
LOOKING BACK NOW I FEEL LIKE I
KIND OF TOOK THAT FOR GRANTED.
>>BUT A LOT OF CONSERVATIVE MEN
DIDN'T SEE THAT AS PROGRESS.
THEY KEPT SAYING WE WANT OUR
COUNTRY BACK.
MEANING, WE WANT
IT BACK FOR US.
BUT AGAIN, DON'T
READ TOO MUCH INTO OUR
SPECULATION ON IT BECAUSE THEY
DID NOT BREAK DOWN BY GENDER WHY
THEY ARE UPSET OR LESS UPSET,
THEY JUST BROKE IT DOWN OVERALL,
AND EXPLAINED THAT THE GENDERS
DO VIEW IT A LITTLE DIFFERENT.
>>ANOTHER PIECE OF INFORMATION
OR DATA THAT I THOUGHT WAS
INTERESTING --
>>MORE AMERICANS ARE STRESSED
OUT, THEY ARE FEELING MORE
ANXIETY, AND IT IS AFFECTING
THEM PHYSICALLY AS WELL BECAUSE
THEY ARE GETTING LESS SLEEP, AND
WHEN YOU ARE STRESSED OUT, YES,
IT'S AN EMOTION BUT IT ALSO HAS
A PHYSICAL REACTION IN THE BODY,
YOU RELEASE MORE CORTISOL, YOU
ARE EATING UNHEALTHY FOODS,
SLEEPING LESS, SO THIS WILL
AFFECT OUR HEALTH AS WELL.
AND I
KNOW I CAN DEFINITELY SYMPATHIZE
WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST
SLEEP OVER THESE ISSUES.
>>IN SOME WAYS I'M SURPRISED
THAT THE ANXIETY IS GREATER, AND
GOD HELP US IF THERE IS ANY KIND
OF ECONOMIC CRASH BECAUSE THIS
WILL SHOOT THROUGH THE ROOF.
LOOK, MINIMUM WAGE IS $7.25,
THAT'S $15,000 A YEAR, HOW DO
YOU NOT LAY AWAKE AT NIGHT IF
YOU ARE MAKING $15,000 A YEAR?
HOW DO YOU LIVE ON THAT?
AND
THAT'S TRUE FOR 
A LOT OF
AMERICANS.
AND SO MANY AMERICANS
NOW HAVE BEEN CRUNCHED DOWN TO
MINIMUM WAGE, THEY USED TO HAVE
GOOD JOBS AND THEY DON'T
ANYMORE.
AND THEY NEED
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE AND THAT
HURTS THEIR SENSE OF
SELF-RESPECT.
AND CONSERVATIVES
THINK THEY ARE ALL BOMBS, THEY
ALL WANT HANDOUTS.
THEY DON'T
WANT HANDOUTS, THEY MAKE $7.25,
THEY NEEDED FOR THEIR KIDS.
THEY
AREN'T BOMBS.
A LOT OF THESE
PEOPLE ARE WORKING POOR AND THE
MIDDLE CLASS, IT'S HARD NOT TO
GET STRESSED OUT.
I HOPE WE
DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF ECONOMIC
CRASH, IF IT DOES THESE NUMBERS
ARE GOING 
TO BE ASTRONOMICAL.
