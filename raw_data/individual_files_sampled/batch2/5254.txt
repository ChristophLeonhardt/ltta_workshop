NBC News national security reporter Kendall a nyan has been reporting on today's rather short White House meeting on election security his story right now is on nbcnews.com its headline the Trump administration has no central strategy for election security and no one's in charge ken thanks for joining me tonight great CRE thanks for having me your story digs in deeper than just what is blatantly odd about this meeting and it's it's brevity a walk us through what former and current officials are telling you yeah and this is not some great scoop some great feat of investigative reporting re this is simply talking to folks and listening to cabinet officials talk in public about their efforts to combat for an election interference and what they say like for example the Department of Homeland Security secretary in an interview with our own Peter Alexander in in Aspen talked about the things that DHS is doing working with the states on election security but then she said but you know what that's not enough we really need a whole-of-government strategy what she didn't say was there isn't one but that's what everybody you talk to about this has said and I was flabbergasted when the White House released a statement tonight that said that there has been such a strategy since Donald Trump took office I haven't found anyone who's ever seen that strategy but I've talked to a lot of people who say that no such strategy exists and what I mean by that look the FBI is doing things they have created a foreign influence task force they are trying to focus on this problem of the Russians and others interfering in our politics the Russians are on social media as we speak manipulating American public opinion the NSA the National Security Agency has said that they are stepping up their efforts in cyberspace most of that is secret but what we don't have is anything that knits this together we have no leadership from the Oval Office and this is the kind of issue that really requires it because there are some really hard problems like you know the Russians playing on Twitter and Facebook those are private companies there are First Amendment issues at play there may be there may be required changes in law or some public policy issues and when you don't have the executive branch leadership on this you really lose the power of the full federal government you don't have a strategy have different agencies trying to do what they can and don't forget some of these officials testified Congress including Chris Rea the FBI director that they had never been asked by the president to tackle Russian election interference so it's hard to know what the White House is talking about when they say they've had a strategy from day one right and you mentioned the companies there's also all these different states involved and we have a system that decentralizes our elections something that didn't get a ton of attention was I was a proposal in the house to put 380 million into the state state efforts to combat this I led by Democrats that was defeated by Republicans there how much does this effort also require upgrading what states can handle when the Moller investigation has revealed how these country backed efforts are going after individual states that may not have the cyber know-how right now yeah I mean every state official you talked to says they need more money they need upgraded technology they need more resources but I actually think that while this the sort of vulnerabilities of state election systems are troubling when you think of the three ways the Russians attack the election they did hack into they tempt it into breach 21 States and they got into seven that may have been the least effective method that they use though re the most effective was they hacked the Democratic National Committee they hacked John Podesta they stole their emails and they released them and then the second most effective arguably was their manipulation of public opinion and social media it's really even hard to measure how much influence that had on the election and that's still going on they may know they may not touch a state election database this time around for their own reasons but they are every day playing on social media there's a website called Hamilton 68 that measures some of it on Twitter in there and they're trying to divide Americans on race on guns on all sorts of issues and Dan coats the Director of National Intelligence gave a speech the other day and he said this is happening they're interfering our politics what he didn't say was there's really nothing that we're doing about it we haven't deterred we the US government has not deterred this behavior at all and the attempted hack of Claire McCaskill suggests that the Russians are not deterred from trying again to hack into political campaigns either re-write it's a huge story and when we look at some of the footage that looks different over time you think about what's we're learning about the kaskell it's just scratching the surface and we're just only about a hundred days out from these midterms so a lot going on Ken Delaney an NBC News national reporter thanks for being here on a Friday night I appreciate it thanks a lot it has been a big news day we have a lot to get to including what happens when you are less than truthful
