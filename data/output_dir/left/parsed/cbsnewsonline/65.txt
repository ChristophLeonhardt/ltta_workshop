TRUMP RALLY, RIGHT? 
WE HAVE A GOOD TIME. 
WE HAVE A GOOD TIME.

STATE BY A LOT.

HIGHS.

SENATE IS CONSIDERING A TRULY 
EXCEPTIONAL NOMINEE FOR THE 
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT -- 
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH.  
 
>> HE IS DOING REALLY WELL, BUT 
DO YOU BELIEVE THE ANGER AND

IT IS SICK. 
THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS NOW SEEING 
HIS AMAZING INTELLECT AND HIS 
BRILLIANT LEGAL MIND,  JUDGE

EVERYBODY HAS TO GET OUT AND

I'M HERE FOR A SPECIFIC REASON, 
PLEASE WELCOME THE PERSON THAT 
WE HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR, HE IS 
NOW LEADING IN THE POLLS.

ALWAYS PUT MONTANA FIRST, AND 
STICK WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP  TO 
MAKE SURE THAT WE ADVANCE HIS 
AGENDA. 
.  
>> WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL AND 
REPLACE OBAMACARE, AND GIVE YOU 
OPTIONS ON HEALTHCARE THAT YOU 
CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD. 
WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT YOUR 
PUBLIC LANDS, AND FIGHT AGAINST

TO GRAB YOUR GUNS. 
   
>> WE ARE GOING TO CONFIRM OR 
JUSTICES, LIKE NEIL COURSE 
SUCH, AND KAVANAUGH, PEOPLE 
THAT WILL UPHOLD THE 
CONSTITUTION,  AND DEFEND YOUR 
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS. 
.  SPEAKING OF THE 
SECOND AMENDMENT -- WE HAVE 
SOME BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT. 
WE WERE INFORMED AND LEARNED 
LAST NIGHT THAT THE NRA HAS 
ENDORSED MY CAMPAIGN. 
  
>> WE ARE GOING TO SECURE OUR 
BORDERS, ENFORCE OUR LAWS, AND 
BUILD THAT WALL. 
   
>>  BUILD THAT 
WALL, BUILD THAT WALL.  
BUILD THAT WALL. 
BUILD THAT WALL. 
BUILD THAT WALL. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO KEEP THIS 
ECONOMY GOING, YOUR TAXES LOW, 
AND GET GOVERNMENT OFF OF YOUR 
BACK, AND OUT OF YOUR WALLET. 
  
>> WE HAVE ALL SEEN THE 
PROBLEMS WITH BIG GOVERNMENT, 
POLITICIANS REPRESENTING 
THEMSELVES AND NOT US, 
INTOXICATED WITH PRIVILEGE AND 
POWER, THEY START WORRYING 
ABOUT THE NEXT ELECTION INSTEAD 
OF THE NEXT GENERATION. 
 
>> RESIDENT TRUMP, I AGREE WITH 
YOU, WE NEED TERM LIMITS. 
.  
>> THAT IS WHY, IF YOU ELECT ME,
I PROMISE TO SERVE NO MORE THAN 
2 TERMS. 
THE PEOPLE OF MONTANA SUPPORT 
TERM LIMITS. 
THEY BELIEVE IN DOING YOUR JOB 
AND RETURNING HOME AND SODA 
WHY. 
  
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP, THANK YOU 
FOR YOUR SUPPORT.  
WE NEED EVERYONE ACROSS THE 
STATE TO STEP UP AND WE CAN WIN 
THIS RACE. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I ARE 
COUNTING  ON YOU TO HELP US 
HERE. 
   
>> SO, TONIGHT I HUMBLY STAND 
BEFORE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU
AND ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THIS 
NOVEMBER.

MAY GOD BLESS EACH AND EVERYONE 
OF YOU,  AND THE UNITED STATES 
OF AMERICA. 
THANK YOU. 
 
>> THANK YOU MATT, VERY MUCH. 
THANK YOU. 
.  
>> MATT ROSENDALE.  
VERY VERY IMPORTANT A VERY VERY 
IMPORTANT. 
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ELECT 
MATT ROSENDALE AND OTHER 
REPUBLICANS. 
WE HAVE TO GET THE REPUBLICANS. 
WE WILL GET THINGS WE WANT, WE 
HAVE STARTED THE WALL,  
EVERYBODY WANTS OF THE WALL. 
WE HAVE SPENT $3.2 BILLION ON 
THE WALL. 
WE HAVE TO GET THE REST OF THE 
FUNDING. 
WE ARE GOING TO GET IT. 
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO OBSTRUCT 
THAT, THEY WANT TO OBSTRUCT OUR 
GREAT JUSTICES. 
BY THE WAY, YOU OBSTRUCT THESE 
JUSTICES, YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE 
YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. 
YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE YOUR RIGHT
TO THOSE GUNS, YOU'RE GOING TO 
LOSE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. 
SO, BE CAREFUL. 
BE CAREFUL. 
  
>> AND, DON'T FORGET, TESTER IS 
GOING TO VOTE WITH THE WATERS 
AND -- PELOSI, CAN YOU IMAGINE, 
MAXINE WATERS IS YOUR NEW 
LEADER IN THE PARTY YOU MARK 
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? 
MAXINE WATERS. 
SHE IS SOMETHING. 
BUT, IS GOING TO VOTE FOR 
SCHUMER, THEY'RE GOING TO DO 
WHATEVER THEY SAY. 
I WILL SAY THIS -- ONE THING -- 
THEIR POLICIES ARE HORRIBLE, 
THEY ARE FOR OPEN BORDERS, 
MEANING -- LITTLE THE CRIME 
COME IN. 
THEY ARE AGAINST SO MANY THINGS 
THAT YOU WANT. 
I HAVE BEEN SAYING IT STRONGLY, 
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAYÃ
THEY'RE GOING TO HURT YOUR 
SOCIAL SECURITY SO BADLY, AND 
THEY ARE KILLING YOU ON 
MEDICARE, JUST REMEMBER THAT. 
I'M GOING TO PROTECT YOUR 
SOCIAL SECURITY, WE ARE GOING 
TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR SOCIAL 
SECURITY. 
MATT ROSENDALE IS GOING TO MAKE 
SURE  WE ARE NOT TOUCHING YOUR 
SOCIAL SECURITY, AND YOUR 
MEDICARE IS ONLY GOING ONE WAY, 
THAT IS STRONGER. 
THEY'RE GOING TO END UP TAKING 
IT AWAY FROM YOU, AND YOU WANT 
EVEN KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. 
AND, ON TOP OF THAT, YOU WILL 
PAY MORE TAXES. 
IT IS CRAZY. 
JOHN TESTER WILL NEVER DRAIN 
THE SWAMP, BECAUSE HE HAPPENS 
TO LIVE IN THE SWAMP, AND HE 
LOVES THE SWAMP. 
JOHN TESTER -- -- I FEEL A 
LITTLE GUILTY, BECAUSE HE DID 
RUN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL 
COMMERCIAL. 
I HEARD YESTERDAYÃIT STARTED 
-- AND HE IS LIKE MY BEST 
FRIEND, PRESIDENT TRUMP , 
PRESIDENT TRUMP THIS, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP THAT. 
IT IS AMAZING, WHEN YOU WHEN A 
STATE BY A LOT OF POINTS, HOW 
EVEN DEMOCRATS CAN LIKE YOU, 
ISN'T THAT CRAZY? 
BUT, THE PROBLEM IS HE IS NEVER 
GOING TO VOTE FOR ME. 
HE IS NOT GOING TO VOTE. 
BUT, HE IS TAKING MORE CRASHÃ
CASH FROM LOBBYISTS THEN ALMOST 
ANYONE IN THE ENTIRE SENATE. 
HE IS CONTROLLED BY HIS DONORS. 
ONE OF THE SADDEST THINGS THAT 
I HAVE SEEN IS WHEN JOHN TESTER
, AND WHAT HE DID TO A GREAT, 
GREAT MAN -- ADMIRAL RONNIE 
JACKSON. 
  
>> ADMIRAL JACKSON WAS SUBJECT 
TO HORRIBLE LIES AND SMEARS. 
NOW, I AM -- YOU KNOW, A VICTIM 
OF THAT TOO, BUT I'M GETTING 
USED TO IT. 
AT LEAST IT IS MY JOB. 
YOU KNOW, I WAS GOING TO SAYÃ
I'M A POLITICIAN. 
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I WOULD 
SAY THAT I AM A POLITICIAN. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE -- I GUESS THAT 
I AM A POLITICIAN. 
YOU KNOW? 
. 
>> I GUESS THAT I'M A 
POLITICIAN. 
THINK OF IT --  I DIDN'T WANT 
TO SAY THAT. 
ONE OF THE FEW TIMES THAT I 
HAVE SAID IT, YEAH. 
I'M A POLITICIAN. 
BUT, YOU KNOWÃI HAVE ONLY RUN 
ONCE, AND THAT WAS FOR 
PRESIDENT, AND I ONE, HOW DID 
THAT HAPPEN, RIGHT? 
IS THAT NICE? 
I ONE ONCE, SO --   
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SPENT 
THEIR LIVES TRYING TO BE 
PRESIDENT, SOME WE RESPECT IN 
SOME WE DO NOT RESPECT TOO MUCH.
BUT, RONNIE JACKSON, HE IS A 
DOCTOR, HE IS AN ADMIRAL, HE IS 
ACTUALLY THE DOCTOR THAT GAVE 
ME MY PHYSICAL, AND HE SAID -- 
THAT I'M IN GREAT SHAPE. 
  
>> AND THE DEMOCRATS AND 
LIBERALS, AND DEEP STATE, THEY 
WERE UPSET TO HEAR THAT. 
SO, THEY GOT TOUGHER AND TOUGHER
AND THEY LIED MORE -- THEY 
WRITE MORE BOOKS NOWÃI NEVER 
SAW -- I HAVE BOOKS STACKED UP 
THE SIDE. 
ACTUALLY -- THE ONES THAT ARE 
REALLY GOOD ARE NUMBER ONE, 
TWO, AND THREE ON THE BEST 
SELLERS LIST, THE ONES THAT ARE 
-- THE REALLY GOOD ONES. 
YOU KNOW, I CALL IT JUSTICE, 
BUT SHE IS -- JUDGE, BUT SHE IS 
JUSTICE TO ME, JENNY, WE LOVE 
HER. 
JUDGE JENIN, BY GREG GERRIT HOW 
ABOUT ONES YOU KNOW, HE HAS A 
VERY SUCCESSFUL BOOK . SO MANY, 
AND THEY'RE ALL DOING GREAT. 
THAT IS WHAT MAKES ME HAPPY. 
BUT, THE MEDIA DOES NOT TALK 
ABOUT THOSE BOOKS. 
ONLY TALK ABOUT THE BAD ONES. 
OF WHICH, THERE ARE PLENTY. 
THEIR ALLIES, BUT THEY ARE 
PLENTY. 
ABOUT TELESIS ADMIRAL JACKSON, 
HIS REPUTATION WAS ATTACKED AND 
ALL THOSE HORRIBLE THINGS THAT 
WERE SAID ABOUT HIM TURNED OUT 
TO BE LIES AND THEY TURNED OUT 
TO BE FALSE. 
REMEMBER? 
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT. 
IN THE LAST ELECTION WASHINGTON 
DEMOCRATS PUT JOHN TESTER IN 
CHARGE OF ELECTING EXTREME 
LIBERALS. I MEAN, I'M TALKING 
ABOUT SERIOUS LIBERALS. 
MANY OF WHOM YOU ARE WATCHING 
ATTACK JUDGE KAVANAUGH , AND 
LOOKING LIKE FOOLS, FRANKLY. 
LOOKING LIKE FOOLS. 
 
>> AND ONE OF THEM WILL MOST 
LIKELY BE A CANDIDATE TO RUN 
AGAINST HER FAVORITE OF ALL 
TIME PRESIDENT, ME. 
 
>> BUT, WHEN I SEE THE ANGER IN 
THEIR EYES, WHEN I SEE THE 
ANGER OF WHAT THEY SAY, TO AN 
INTELLECT FAR GREATER THAN 
THEIRS, NOT EVEN A CONTEST. 
BUT, I SEE THE ANGER AND HATRED,
WHAT ARE THEY DOING? 
WHAT ARE THEY DOING? 
THEY ARE LOSING BY DOING IT, 
THEY ARE LOSING BY DOING IT. 
I JUST WANT TO FINISH OFF -- 
WHAT TESTER DID TO ADMIRAL 
JACKSON SHOULD NEVER BE 
ALLOWED. 
RONNIE JACKSON IS A GREAT MAN. 
RONNIE JACKSON HAS LED A GREAT 
AND BEAUTIFUL LIFE. 
AND TO HAVE LIES TOLD ABOUT HIM,
I WOULD NEVER REPEAT WHAT THEY 
ARE. 
SEE, IN MY CASE THEY REPEAT 
THEM. 
AS THEY DO NOT REPEAT THEM, 
THEY'RE TERRIBLE. 
THEY SAY NO, WE ARE GOING TO 
DENY THEM. 
.  
>> I LOVE -- BUT, HERE'S THE 
ONLY THINGÃHE PUTS OF ALL 
THESE LOSERS THAT SAID HORRIBLE 
THINGS. 
I HAVE TO TALK TO HIM. 
ONE AFTER ANOTHER. 
DONALD TRUMP -- HE HAS LOST IT 
UP HERE. 
YOU KNOW, IT IS PRETTY TOUGH. 
I STAND UP HERE GIVING SPEECHES 
FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF, MANY 
TIMES WITHOUT NOTES, AND THEN 
THEY SAY HE HAS LOST IT, AND 
YET WE HAVE 25,000 PEOPLE 
SHOWING UP TO SPEECHES AND BY 
THE WAY, LOOK AT ALL THE FAKE 
NEWS BACK THERE. 
  
>> DONALD TRUMP -- THEY GO 
DONALD TRUMP, YOU KNOW WHAT IS 
REALLY FUNNY -- DONALD TRUMP 
HAS LOST IT, SOÃI DETAILÃ17 
GREAT REPUBLICANS. I MEAN, 
SENATORS, THE GOVERNORS, A 
COUPLE OF PEOPLE, GREAT PEOPLE, 
LIKE BEN CARSON, BEN CARSON WAS 
TOUGH. 
BUT, I BEAT 17 GREAT PEOPLE. 
AND RESPECTFULLY SAY I BEAT THE 
BUSH DYNASTY. 
OKAY. 
.  
>> PRETTY RECENTLY. 
OKAY. 
NOW I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF 
GOING AGAINST CROOKED HILLARY 
CLINTON. 
  
>> SO I BEAT CROOKED HILLARY [ 
CHEERING ]  
>> I BEAT CROOKED HILLARY, AND 
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS HARD. 
FRANKLY -- IF WE DIDN'T KNOW 
BETTER, MAYBE WE ARE STARTING 
TO FIND THINGS OUT THAT WE 
DIDN'T KNOW, IT IS HARD. 
IT IS HARDER TO WIN THEN 
POPULAR VOTE. 
POPULAR VOTE, YOU GO TO 3-4 
STATES AND YOU WIN. 
IT IS LIKE THE HUNDRED YARD 
DASH VERSUS RUNNING THE MILE. 
HE PRACTICE DIFFERENTLY. 
SHE FORGOT THAT. 
SHE FORGOT TO GO TO A VERY 
IMPORTANT STATE. 
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO GO 
TO MICHIGAN TOO MUCH. 
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO GO 
SHE SAID TO WISCONSIN. 
I DO HEAR THAT HER HUSBAND SAID 
YOU KNOWÃYOU HAD BETTER GO TO 
MICHIGAN, YOU HAD BETTER START 
GOING TO WISCONSIN. 
FORTUNATELY, SHE DID NOT LISTEN 
TO THAT. 
BUT -- BUT, THINK OF IT -- SO, 
I BEAT THE REPUBLICANS, 
GOVERNOR SANDERS. 
I BEAT THE BUSH DYNASTY, 
RESPECTFULLY. 
I BEAT HILLARY, WHO STOLE IT 
FROM BERNIE, BERNIE SHOULD HAVE 
ONE, BUT THAT IS OKAY. 
THEY STOLE IT. 
SUPER DELEGATES. 
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT? 
BERNIE SHOULD BE ANGRY, WHY IS 
HE NOT ANGRY? 
CRAZY BERNIE. 
HE IS SO CRAZY, BUT YOU KNOW 
WHAT? 
I SAW HIM THE OTHER DAY ON 
TELEVISION. 
AND HE IS RANTING AND RAVING. 
HE IS SITTING BEHIND A 
MICROWAVE. 
I'M GOING TO DO THIS -- I'M 
GOING TO DO THAT. 
THE HAIR IS FINE, HE IS GOING 
CRAZY. 
HE IS GOING CRAZY. 
AND I SAID TO MY WIFE -- HONEY, 
LOOK AT THAT GUY. 
YOU HAVE TO HAND IT TO HIM, YOU 
KNOW, YOU HAVE TO HEADED TO 
HIM. 
HE DOES NOT QUIT, HE DOES NOT 
GIVE UP. 
I JUST DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE 
ALLOWED TAT TO HAPPEN, AND HE 
GOES BACK INTO BEING AN 
INDEPENDENT, BUT NOW HE IS 
COMING BACK IN, AND I GUESS 
THAT HE IS GOING TO RUN, BUT 
THINK OF IT -- SO, YOU BEAT TWO 
DYNASTIES, YOU BEAT ALL THESE 
POLITICIANS, WHEN I ANNOUNCED 
THAT I WAS GOING TO RUN, -- [ 
CHEERING ].  
>> HE SAID WHY WOULD HE RUN? 
HE SAID THIS IS THE FINEST FIELD
OF REPUBLICANS EVER ASSEMBLED. 
ACTUALLY, LOOKED AT MY WIFE AND 
I SAID YOU KNOW -- THAT IS HIS 
BUSINESS, HE JUST SAID THESE 
ARE THE FINEST EVER ASSEMBLED. 
WHY AM I DOING THIS? 
I SAID THAT IS OKAY. 
I WILL DO IT ANYWAY, LET'S SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS. 
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
SO, I BEAT ALL THE SENATORS, 
ALL OF THESE GOVERNORS, ALL OF 
 
MINDS. 
THEN, I BEAT THE OTHER SIDE, 
AND THEN I LISTENED -- IS HE 
CONFIDENT? 
I THINK I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT, 
RIGHT? 
 .  
>> IS HE COMPETENT? 
AND THEIR RATINGS ARE DOWN THE 
TUBES, YOU KNOW WHY? 
BECAUSE PEOPLE GET IT, THEY 
REALLY GET IT. 
BUT, IT IS FUNNY TO HEAR THAT 
YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE VICTORIES 
-- YOU KNOW WHAT? 
MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE ARE 
WINNING IN THE UNITED STATES 
NOW. 
WE ARE WINNING ON TRADE, WE ARE 
WINNING WITH OUR MILITARY, WE 
ARE KNOCKING THE HILL OUT OF 
THE TERRORISTS . WE ARE WINNING 
NOW IN THE UNITED STATES. 
YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON. 
WE HAVE NEW DEALS BEING MADE. 
WE HAVE A DEAL THAT WE JUST 
MADE WITH MEXICO, THAT IS A 
FAIR DEAL. 
IT IS NOT THAT HORRENDOUS DEAL 
THAT WAS MADE YEARS AGO, THAT 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHANGED YEARS 
AGO. 
WE ARE NEGOTIATING WITH CANADA. 
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
WE ARE IN A LITTLE BIT OF A 
SKIRMISH, BUT DOING REALLY WELL 
WITH CHINA. 
YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. 
REALLY WELL. 
 
>> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE 
PRESIDENT OF CHINA, BUT 
HONESTLY -- WE HAVE TO BE 
TREATED FAIRLY. LAST YEAR, WE 
HAD A TRADE DEFICIT OF ANYWHERE 
FROM 375 MILLION DOLLARS -- 
BILLION DOLLARS. 
EITHER ONE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. 
SO, WE ARE DOING THAT, AND IT 
IS WORKING OUT VERY WELL. 
I JUST CAME ON STAGE, AND I WAS 
TOLD THAT KIM JONG-UN SAID SOME 
TERRIFIC THINGS ABOUT ME. 
HE SAID THAT I HAVE FAITH IN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
THINK OF THIS -- YOU DON'T HEAR 
THAT --   
>> AND, JUST MOMENTS AGO, THEY 
PUT ON THAT -- HE SAID, VERY 
STRONGLY THAT WE WANT TO 
DENUCLEARIZE NORTH KOREA DURING 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S  TENURE. 
THAT IS A NICE --   
>> -- EVEN IF HE DIDN'T JUST 
SAY IT, WE GOT OUR HOSTAGES BACK
THERE ARE NO MORE MISSILE 
TESTS. 
THERE HAS BEEN NO MORE ROCKETS 
FLYING OVER JAPAN. 
THERE HAVE BEEN NO MORE NUCLEAR 
TESTS. 
WE HAVE A GOOD FEELING, I LIKE 
HIM, HE LIKES ME, WHO KNOWS 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN? 
BUT, I CAN TELL YOU WHY, THEY 
ID BEFORE HE TOOK OFFICE, AND 
EVEN, I MUST SAY, BECAUSE AS 
YOU KNOW, THE RHETORIC WAS 
FAIRLY TOUGH. 
IT IS INTERESTING, WITH HIM, I 
HAD VERY TOUGH RHETORIC, AND 
THE FAKE NEWS WAS SAYING -- IT 
IS TOO TOUGH, HE IS GOING TO 
GET US INTO THE WAR. 
IT IS TERRIBLE. 
HE IS BEING TOO TOUGH. 
IT IS HORRIBLE. 
WHAT DOES HE KNOW ABOUT THIS? 
HE KNOWS NOTHING. 
I WATCHED ALL THESE GUYS WHO 
HAVE BEEN LOSING FOR 30 YEARS 
EXPLAINING WHY MY METHOD OF 
NEGOTIAION WAS NOT WORKING. 
   
>> RIGHT? 
AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY. 
I RESPECT HIM, HE RESPECTS ME. 
I THINK SOMETHING IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN. 
TAKE YOUR TIME. 
I SAY -- TAKE YOUR TIME, 
SANCTIONS ARE ON, BUT THINK OF 
-- WE GOT BACK OUR HOSTAGES. 
I DID NOT PAY $1.8 BILLION. 
WE GOT BACK OUR HOSTAGES. 
WE PAID NOTHING. 
  
>> BUT, IT IS FUNNY, YOU KNOW, 
BECAUSE OTHER THAN NATO, 
BECAUSE I GOT THEM TO PAY 
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS MORE, BECAUSE WE ARE 
PAYING FOR NATO. 
WERE PAYING THIS MASSIVE 
PERCENTAGE OF COST. 
WE ARE PROTECTING EUROPE. 
BUT, GET THEM TO PAY BILLIONS 
OF DOLLARS MORE, AND THE FAKE 
NEWS SAIDÃHE WAS NOT 
ESPECTFUL TO THE LEADERS OF 
OTHER COUNTRIES. 
AND, THERE RIGHT ANYWAY BECAUSE 
I SAID LISTEN FOLKS, I'M SORRY, 
YOU HAVE TO PAY UP. 
YOU ARE DELINQUENT. 
YOU KNOW? 
IN REAL ESTATE WE SAY YOU ARE 
DELINQUENT. 
AND, SOMEBODY ASKED ME -- IT IS 
REALLY AMAZING THAT THEY DON'T 
COVER THIS, IF THEY DO THEY 
WOULD HAVE SAID THIS IS 
TERRIBLE. 
ONE OF THE LEADERS IN FRONT OF 
THE OTHERS -- 28 NATIONS, ONE 
OF THE LEADERS I GET ALONG WITH 
ÃTHE RESPECT IS NOW, BECAUSE 
THEY COULD NOT BELIEVE -- FOUR 
YEARS LATER SPENDING WAS GOING 
LIKE THIS, AND BY THE WAY, THE 
SUSPENDING TO PROTECT THEM 
AGAINST RUSSIA. YOU KNOW, THEY 
KEEP TALKING ABOUT RUSSIA. 
WE ARE PROTECTINGÃI GOT THEM 
TO PAY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
MORE, OKAY? 
BUT -- THEY SAID SIR, COULD WE 
ASK YOU ONE QUESTIONÃIT IS 
ALWAYS NICE WHEN A PRESIDENT OR 
PRIME MINISTER CALLS YOU SERVE. 
THAT MEANS THAT HE HAS A 
CERTAIN RESPECT -- HE SAID IF 
YOU DON'T WALK AWAY FROM THESE 
MEETINGS WITH US PAYING WHAT WE 
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PAIN, OR 
MUCH MORE, WILL YOU LEAVE US? 
I SAID YES I WILL. 
AND THEY'LL SETTLEÃ
   
>> THEY ALL SAID WE WILL PAY, 
WE WILL PAY. 
NOW, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA 
DOESN'T WANT ME TO SAY THAT. 
THEY WANT ME TO SAYÃNO, NO 
SIR, WE WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU. 
BUT, THEN THERE IS NO REASON 
FOR THEM TO PAY, RIGHT? 
WHY WOULD THEY PAY? 
SUPPOSING THEY ASK THE SAME 
QUESTION. 
AND, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
BILLIONS. 
LAST YEAR -- SECRETARY 
STOLTENBERG, SECRETARY-GENERAL 
ÃHEAD OF NATO . HE IS LIKE MY 
BIGGEST FAN. 
AND I LIKE HIM TOO. 
BUT, HE GOES AROUND THE SAME -- 
LAST YEAR, THAT WAS WHEN I JUST 
ÃYOU KNOW, I WAS ONLY AN 
OFFICER ABOUT 14 SECONDS, SO I 
CANNOTÃYOU KNOW, I DID NOT 
WANT TO USE TOO MUCH BRAVADO, 
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I PAID EXTRA? 
$44 BILLION. 
THAT WAS LAST YEAR. 
THIS YEAR, IT IS MUCH HIGHER, 
BECAUSE NOW I FEEL COMFORTABLE. 
I ASKED HIM IN A MORE FIRM 
MANNER, AND THEIR PAIN. 
AND THEY SHOULD PAY. 
BUT -- THEY WERE SAYING THAT IT 
DID NOT TREAT THEM WELL. 
IF I WOULD HAVE DONE WHAT THEY 
SAID, OR IF I WOULD HAVE'S SAID 
ÃDONE WITH THESE CONSULTANTS 
AND THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE 
WATCHING TELEVISION, USED TO DO 
THIS STUFF, THEY ALL FAILED. 
THEY FAILED MISERABLY. 
SO, WE HAVE OUR OWN WAY, IT IS 
A GREAT WAY, BUT IT IS REALLY 
INTERESTING, BECAUSE WHEN I WAS 
DEALING WITH NORTH KOREA, AND 
THEY SAID HE IS TOO TOUGH, HE 
IS TOO TOUGH. 
ONE OF MY BEST MEETINGS EVER 
WAS WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. AND 
THEY SAID -- HE WAS TOO NICE. 
HE WAS TOO NICE. 
THEY WANTED ME TO HAVE A BOXING 
MATCH ON THE STAGE. 
WE HAD A GREAT MEETING. 
WE TALKED ABOUT UKRAINE, WE 
TALKED ABOUT SYRIA. 
WE TALKED ABOUT THE PROTECTION 
OF ISRAEL. 
WE TALKED ABOUT SO MANY GREAT 
THINGS. 
BUT, THEY CAME BACK AND THEY 
SAID -- THAT WAS TERRIBLE. 
I SAID WHAT WAS TERRIBLE? 
WE HAD A GREAT MEETING. 
AND WHEN I CAME OFFSTAGE THEY 
SAID THAT WAS A GREAT MEETING, 
THAT WAS A GREAT -- AND I GOT 
ONTO THE PLANE AND THEY SAID 
SIR, I DON'T THINK THEY'LLÃI 
SAID, THEY LIKED IT. 
THEY JUST -- THEIR FATE, THEIR 
FAKE NEWS. 
WE HAD A GREATÃWE HAD A GREAT 
MEETING. 
IT WAS A GREAT MEETING. 
AND YOU KNOW, THE FUNNY THING, 
IF I WAS TOUGH, IF I WAS -- YOU 
ARE NEVER GOING TO DO THIS 
AGAIN. 
THERE WILL BE NO MORE OF THIS, 
AND NO MORE OF THAT. 
AND, STOOD HIM AND THEN STARTED 
BOXING, -- YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD 
HAVE HAPPENED? 
THEY WOULD HAVE SAID HE IS TOO 
TOUGH, THAT WAS A DISGRACE TO 
OUR NATION. 
THE TRUTH IS -- WITH THESE 
PEOPLE, YOU CANNOT WIN. 
BUT, WE ARE WINNING. 
I'M PRESIDENT. 
YOUR PRESIDENT, WE ARE WINNING. 
. 
>> SO, EVERYBODY KNOWS -- JOHN 
TESTER'S GAME, HE SAYS ONE 
THING IN MONTANA, BUT DOES THE 
EXACT OPPOSITE IN WASHINGTON. 
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS. 
HE WILL COME HOME AND TELL YOU 
ABOUT YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT, 
THEN HE WILL VOTE FOR SOMETHING 
WHERE YOU ARE NOT THE HILL OUT 
OF IT.  
JOHN TESTER TALKS LIKE HE IS 
FROM MONTANA, BUT HE DOES LIKE 
HE IS NANCY PELOSI, THAT IS 
WHAT HE BUILDS, HE IS A NANCY 
PELOSI -- KNOW, LOOK AT HIS 
VOTING. 
IT IS THE SAME VOTING AS 
SCHUMER, NANCY PELOSI, AND THE 
LEGENDARY MAXINE. 
JOHN TESTER VOTED NO ON TAX 
CUTS, AND HE VOTED FOR THE 
OBAMA CARE DISASTER, WHICH WE 
ALMOST REPEALED AND REPLACED, 
BUT WE WILL GET IT DONE, AND 
REMEMBER THISÃREMEMBER THIS 
-- WE GOT RID OF THE MOST 
UNPOPULAR ELEMENT OF OBAMA 
CARE, RIGHT? 
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. 
 
>> WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL 
MANDATE THAT WAS THE MOST 
UNPOPULAR SINGLE -- THAT IS 
WHERE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO PAY 
A FORTUNE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF 
NOT HAVING TO PAY A FORTUNE FOR 
BAD HEALTHCARE. 
RIGHT? 
IT IS INCREDIBLE. 
BUT, WE GOT RID OF IT AND WE 
ARE GETTING RID OF ALL OF IT. 
ONE THING I HAVE TO SAY ALSO -- 
OBAMACARE WAS GOING UP 115%, 
125%, 80%, 60%, 53% OF ALL 
DIFFERENT PLACES. 
IT WAS GOING UP MASSIVELY. 
YOU KNOW, WE WANT TO REPEAL AND 
REPLACE IT, AND IF WE GET 
ENOUGH REPUBLICANS WE WILL, AND 
WE WILL HAVE A MUCH BETTER 
HEALTHCARE, WE HAVE ALREADY 
COME UP WITH SOME OF THEM, 
ASSOCIATION CARE AND -- ETC. 
BUTÃ
   
>> BUT, TO DO IT, AND WE WILL 
DO IT, WE HAD IT, WE HAD IT 
DONE. 
WE HAD IT DONE. 
BUT, REMEMBER -- TESTER VOTED 
NO. 
HE VOTED NO ON CASE LAW, CASE 
LAW, WHAT COULD BE BETTER THAN 
-- 
 
>> SHE VOTED NO ON ENHANCED 
VETTING FOR REFUGEES. 
LET'S JUST LET THEM COME RIGHT 
ON INTO MONTANA, AND YOU SEE 
WHAT IS GOING ON. 
AND JOHN TESTER VOTED IN FAVOR 
OF DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES. 
  
>> THAT IS NOT A PERSON FROM 
MONTANA. 
I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS IN 
MONTANA. 
I DO NOT GET IT. 
HOW DID HE GET ELECTED? 
HOW DID HE GET ELECTED? 
JOHN TESTER VOTED FOR VERY 
LITTLE OBAMA JUDGES. 
99% OF THE TIME. 
AND YET, HE WOULD MAKE IT 
IMPOSSIBLE FOR AN INCREDIBLE, 
DISTINGUISHED, AT, DR., NOT TO 
GET IN. 
THINK AT THAT ONE? 
BUT, SUPER LIBERAL JUDGES, MANY 
OF WHOM ARE MOCKED AND SCORNED, 
AND JOHN TESTER VOTED AGAINST 
OUR INCREDIBLE SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE, NEIL COURSE SUCH, HOW 
DO YOU DO THAT? 
FIRST IN HIS CLASS AT HARVARD, 
FIRST IN HIS CLASS AT OXFORD, 
AND HE DECIDES, I THINK I WILL 
VOTE NO. 
AND BY THE WAY, HE IS GREAT AND 
HE IS DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. 
AND, JUST AS KAVANAUGH WILL DO 
THE SAME. 
  
>> IT IS EMBARRASSING TO WATCH 
THOSE PEOPLE MAKE FOOLS OF 
THEMSELVES AS THEY SCREAM AND 
SHOUT AT THIS GREAT GENTLEMAN. 
THIS ELECTION, YOU ARE NOT JUST 
VOTING FOR A CANDIDATE, YOU ARE 
VOTING FOR WHICH PARTY CONTROLS 
CONGRESS -- VERY IMPORTANT 
THING, VERY IMPORTANT THING. 
I JUST BRING IT UP, BECAUSE I 
VIEW IT AS SOMETHING THATÃYOU 
KNOW, THEY LIKE TO USE THE 
IMPEACH WORDS. 
WE WILL IMPEACH HIM. 
BUT, HE DID NOT DO ANYTHING 
WRONG, DOES NOT MATTER. 
WE WILL IMPEACH HIM. 
WE WILL IMPEACH -- BUT, I SAY 
HOW DO YOU IMPEACH SOMEBODY 
THAT IS DOING A GREAT JOB? 
THAT HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING 
WRONG? 
OUR ECONOMY IS GOOD. 
HOW DO YOU DO IT? 
   
>> HOW DO YOU DO IT? 
WE WILL IMPEACH HIM. 
BUT, HE IS DOING A GREAT JOB. 
DOESN'T MATTER, REMEMBER THAT 
FINALÃIS DOING A GREAT JOB, 
THAT IS NOT MATTER, WE WILL 
IMPEACH HIM. 
IT IS A HILL OF A PLACE IN 
WASHINGTON. 
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKINGÃIF 
THAT HAPPENED,  EVERY TIME A 
REPUBLICAN, OR DEMOCRATÃ
OPPOSITE, GOT ELECTED 
PRESIDENT, SO LET'S A DEMOCRAT 
GET SELECTED SUNDAY, HOPEFULLY 
IT IS A LONG TIME -- 
  
>> LET'S SAY A DEMOCRAT GET 
SELECTED, AND WE HAVE A 
REPUBLICAN HOUSE, WE WILL 
IMPEACH THAT DEMOCRAT, RIGHT? 
AND THEN, A REPUBLICAN, WE WON 
BY A LOT, WE WON BY A BIG 
MARGIN, THAT IS A LOT OF -- 
THAT IS A LOT, THAT ELECTORAL 
COLLEGE, WE WON BY A LOT. 
SO, WE ARE IN THEIR, WE HAVE 
THE BEST EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS IN 
OUR HISTORY. WE HAVE THE BEST 
ECONOMY IN OUR HISTORY. 
YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS IN 
EVERY CATEGORY, IT IS GREAT. 
WE ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. 
WE ARE PUTTING ON PHENOMENAL 
JUDGES. 
AND, YOU TAKE THAT AND YOU DO 
THEN -- WHAT, YOU WILL HAVE A 
COUNTRY THAT IS GOING TO TURN IN
TO A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY. 
BECAUSE, IF THE OPPOSITE PARTY 
BECOMES PRESIDENT, EVERY TIME, 
BEFORE IT EVEN STARTS, BEFORE 
YOU HAVE EVEN FIND OUT WHETHER 
OR NOT HE OR SHE IS GOING TO DO 
A GREAT JOB, THEY WILL SAY WE 
WANT TO IMPEACH THEM, AND YOU 
WILL IMPEACH THEM. 
THIS OR RIDICULOUS. 
BUT, WE WILL WORRY ABOUT THAT 
IF IT EVER HAPPENS. 
BUT, IF IT DOES HAPPEN, IT IS 
HER FAULT, BECAUSE HE DID NOT 
WANT TO VOTE. 
OKAY? 
YOU DID NOT GO OUT TO VOTE. 
YOU DO NOT GO OUT TO VOTE. 
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY THAT IT 
COULD HAPPEN. 
I WILL BE THE ONLY PRESIDENT IN 
HISTORY THAT WILL SAY WHAT A 
JOB HE HAS DONE, BY THE WAY, WE 
ARE IMPEACHING HIM. 
TWO DAYS DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS 
HELD HOSTAGE BY HEATERS. 
ABSOLUTE HEATERS. 
LEFT WING HATERS. 
ANGRY MOBS, DEEP STATE 
RADICALS, AND THEIR FAKE NEWS 
ú 
THOSE PEOPLE ARE THE BEST. 
THEY ARE THE BEST ALLIES -- 
  
>> I MEAN, YOU LOOK AT THE 
WASHINGTON POST, OR THE NEW 
YORK TIMES, I COULD NEVER GET A 
GOOD STORY. 
I MEAN, YOU LOOK AT THIS 
HORRIBLE THING THAT TOOK PLACE 
TODAY, IT IS REALLYÃIS IT 
SUBVERSION, TREASON? 
IT IS A HORRIBLE THING. 
YOU KNOW THE GOOD THING ABOUT 
THAT? 
EVEN LIBERALS THAT HATE ME SAY 
THAT IS TERRIBLE WHAT THEY DID. 
AND IT IS, REALLY TERRIBLE. 
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WON THE 
ELECTION, THE NEW YORK TIMES -- 
ALL THEIR SUBSCRIBERS WERE 
LEAVING., WHEN I AM ULTIMATELY 
NO LONGER PRESIDENT AND 
HOPEFULLY ABOUT 6 1/2 YEARS 
FROM NOW -- 
  
>> THE NEW YORK TIMES WILL GO 
OUT OF BUSINESS. 
ALL OF THEM WILL BE OUT OF 
BUSINESS. 
CNN WILL BE OUT OF BUSINESS. 
THEY ARE ALMOST OUT OF BUSINESS 
NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR 
RATINGS. 
BUT, THEY WILL BE OUT OF 
BUSINESS. 
BUT, THE NEW YORK TIMES, YOU 
REMEMBER, IT IS VERY FAMOUS, 
NOBODY HAS SEEN IT BEFORE, 
MAYBE NEVER DONE BEFORE. 
THEY APOLOGIZED FOR THEIR BAD 
COVERAGE OF ME. 
THEY APOLOGIZED TO THEIR 
SUBSCRIBERS, BECAUSE AFTER I 
WANT EVERYBODY SAID WHAT 
HAPPENED? 
WHAT HAPPENED? 
WE ARE READING THIS PIECE OF 
GARBAGE, AND THE GUY THAT THEY 
KILL EVERY DAY, HE WON. 
SO, THEY WROTE -- DOES ANYBODY 
REMEMBER? 
THEY WROTE AN APOLOGY TO THEIR 
SUBSCRIBERS. 
TO STOP THE FLOW OF PEOPLE 
LEAVING AND GIVING UP THEIR 
SUBSCRIPTION TO THE NEW YORK 
TIMES. 
IT WAS QUITE AMAZING TO WATCH. 
AND YOU KNOW, HONESTLY, FOR TWO 
WEEKS THEY REALLY COVERED ME 
WELL. 
AND THEN IT BEGAN -- AND THEN 
IT GOT WORSE AND WORSE. 
NOW, WE HAVE REACHED AN ALL-
TIME LEVEL, THE LEVEL OF HATRED 
ISÃTHAT IS OKAY. 
ON THEÃON THE WAY OVER HERE I 
CITED LIBERAL PENDANT. HE WAS 
FILLED WITH ANGER, AND HE WAS 
ATTACKING ME AND MY GREAT 
ADMINISTRATION. 
WE HAVE GREAT PEOPLE. 
I WILL TELL YOU, THE WHITE 
HOUSE IS WORKING GOOD. 
MY WIFE PUT OUT A TWEET TODAY, 
DID YOU SEE -- SHE DOESN'T NEED 
TO DO THIS. 
SHE PUT OUT A TWEET -- [ 
APPLAUSE ] 
>> THEY HAVE BEEN STOMPING 
AROUND SCREAMING WITH ANGER UP 
IN MY AREA OF THE WHITE HOUSE, 
WHERE I LIVE WITH MY WIFE AND 
SON. 
THEY HAD ME SCREAMING, SHOUTING 
 
TELEVISION, SAID WHAT ARE THEY 
SAYING? 
I WAS IN THE OVAL OFFICE. 
WE ARE HAVING A TALK ON TRADE. 
ACTUALLY, IT HAPPENED TO BE 
TRADE WITH CANADA. 
THEY WERE TELLING WHAT IS 
HAPPENING. 
AND THEY SAID SIR, YOU'RE NOT 
UP THERE SCREAMING AND RANTING 
AND RAVING. 
YOU ARE TALKING. 
THAT IS HOW DISHONEST IT HAS 
BECOME. 
BUT, ASKED A YOUNG, BRIGHT 
STAFFER OF MINE, WHY ARE THEY 
SO FILLED WITH THIS MUCH HATRED?
WHY? 
UR COUNTRY IS THRIVING, 
PROSPERITY IS SOARING, AND THE 
FUTURE HAS NEVER LOOKED 
BRIGHTER FOR THE USA. 
AND THE YOUNG AIDE LOOKED AT ME 
AND SAID MR. PRESIDENT, THESE 
LIBERAL PUNDITS, THE HATERS, 
BUT THEY ARE SO ANGRY BECAUSE 
YOU HAVE UPSET THEIR ENTIRE WAY 
OF LIFE. 
IT IS TRUE. 
   
>> I SAID -- BUT, LET'S GET 
THIS STRAIGHT, SO THE COUNTRY 
IS REALLY DOING WELL, AND THEY 
LOOKED AT ME, HE SAID SOMETHING 
THAT MAYBE IS TRUE. 
I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE. 
HE SAID SIR, THEY JUST DON'T 
CARE. 
IT IS REALLY PRETTY SAD, RIGHT? 
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT 
IS HAPPENING WITH ALL OF IT 
INCLUDING THE MILITARY, 
REBUILDING. 
AND, EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE 
BUILDING IS BEING MADE RIGHT 
HERE. 
THE BEST MISSILES IN THE WORLD. 
THE BEST PLANES AND SHIPS IN 
THE WORLD. 
THAT IS ALL MADE RIGHT HERE. 
THE SO-CALLED RESISTANCE IS 
ANGRY BECAUSE THERE HORRIBLE 
IDEAS HAVE BEEN REJECTED BY THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND IT IS 
DRIVING THEM CRAZY. 
CRAZY. 
THEY ARE THE ONES HONESTLY THAT 
HAS BEEN DRIVEN CRAZY. 
THE LATEST ACTIVE RESISTANCE IS 
THE OP-ED PUBLISHED IN THE 
FAILING NEW YORK TIMES BY -- AN 
ANONYMOUS GUTLESS COWARD. 
YOU JUST LOOK -- NOBODY KNOWS 
WHO HE IS OR SHE, THEY PUT ME, 
BUT BELIEVE THAT IS A LITTLE 
DESCRIBED,ÃDISGUISE, THAT 
MEANS IT IS A SHE. 
BUT, FOR THE SAKE OF OUR 
NATIONAL SECURITY, THE NEW YORK 
TIMES SHOULD PUBLISH HIS NAME 
AT ONCE. 
I THINK THERE REPORTER SHOULD 
GO AND INVESTIGATE WHO IT IS. 
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD SCOOP. 
 .  
>> THAT WOULD BE A GOOD SCOOP. 
UNELECTED, DEEP STATE 
OPERATIVES WHO DEFY THE VOTERS 
TO PUSH THEIR OWN SECRET AGENDAS
ARE TRULY A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY 
ITSELF. 
AND I WAS SO DISHEARTENED WHEN 
I LOOKED. 
I THINK IT WAS -- SERIOUSLY, 
PEOPLE THAT DON'T EXACTLY DIG 
US, AND THEY DON'T EXACTLY LIKE 
ME, BUT THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR 
US. 
IT IS INCREDIBLE. 
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL THING. 
WE HAVE PICKED UP A LOT OF 
SUPPORT, BECAUSE AT SOME POINT, 
THIS WHOLE THING IS GOING TO BE 
EXPOSED, AND IT IS REALLY BAD, 
AND IT IS REALLY DANGEROUS, AND 
IT IS REALLY SAD FOR THE MEDIA, 
AND THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, IT 
REALLY IS SAD. 
BUT I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE GOOD 
NEWS COMING OUT OF KOREA TODAY, 
THEY WILL HARDLY EVEN REPORT IT.
IF THIS WERE PRESIDENT OBAMA, 
THAT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST STORY 
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
BUT, IT IS GOING TO BE SOONER 
OR LATER, IT WILL BE EXPOSED. 
THE POLICIES OF OUR POLITICAL 
OPPONENTS HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT 
ONLY FAILURE, DESTRUCTION, AND 
HUMILIATION TO OUR COUNTRY. 
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED. 
LOOK AT WHERE WE WERE, AND LOOK 
AT WHERE WE ARE. 
   
>> AND WE HAVE TREMENDOUS 
POTENTIAL UPWARD, AND OTHER 
COUNTRIES ARE NOT DOING WELL AT 
ALL. 
AND HAD I NOT ONE, WE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN IN NEGATIVE. 
WE WOULD NOT BE AT 4.2, WE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN IN NEGATIVE 
NUMBERS. 
WE WERE GOING DOWN. 
WE WERE LOW, AND WE WERE HEADED 
DOWN. 
WE FREED UP THIS COUNTRY WITH 
THE REGULATIONS, AND THE TAX 
CUTS, WE FREED UP OUR COUNTRY, 
AND IT IS GREAT TO WATCH. 
  
>> BUT, IF YOU DO NOT ELECT 
NOT, I WILL TELL YOU -- THEY 
CAN CHANGE IT VERY QUICKLY. 
NANCY PELOSI SAID YESTERDAY, 
SHE WANTS TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. 
  
>> OKAY, IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE 
A POPULAR THING TO DO? 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN 
SO FAR LEFT. 
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DON'T 
TALK ABOUT RED WAVES. 
I MEAN, HISTORICALLY THE PERSON 
THAT IS PRESIDENT, WHEN YOU 
HAVE THE PARTY -- HAVING THE 
PRESIDENT, THEY DO NOT DO WELL 
IN MIDTERMS, BUT NOBODY HAS 
EVER HAD EVERÃAN ECONOMY LIKE 
WE HAVE HAD. 
NOBODY HAS EVER HAD THIS 
ECONOMY, HOPEFULLY YOU WILL 
REMEMBER THAT. 
THEY ROBBED OUR MIDDLE CLASS. 
THAT WAS WHILE SPENDING 
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON 
ADVENTURES OVERSEAS. 
AND WE ARE PULLING WAY BACK BUT 
WE ARE SO RESPECTED NOW, YOU 
CAN PULL BACK A LITTLE BIT. 
BUT, WE ARE SO RESPECTED. 
THEY'RE NOT PLAYING GAMES WITH 
US ANYMORE. I DO NOT WANT TO 
TEMPT THEM TOO MUCH BY TELLING 
YOU BUT THINGS THAT DO NOT HAVE 
ANYMORE, BECAUSE THERE IS NO 
REASON FOR ME TO TELL YOU. 
BUT, WHEN YOU SEE SOME OF THE 
THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUR 
YEARS AGO IN SIX YEARS AGO AND 
EIGHT YEARS AGO, YOU TAKE A 
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED, AND YOU 
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS NOW, WHERE 
WE TOOK THAT HORRIBLE IRAN DEAL 
AND WE TERMINATED IT, AND YOU 
LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON -- 
 
>>  
BUT THESE PEOPLE ENRICH 
THEMSELVES WHILE SHIPPING OUR 
JOBS TO OTHER COUNTRIES. 
AND THEY OVERSAW THE GREATEST 
TRANSFER OF WEALTH IN THE 
HISTORY OF THE WORLD. 
IT'S TRUE. 
THIS IS THE GREATEST TRANSFER, 
NAFTA WAS SUCH A BAD DEAL, SOME 
PEOPLE SAY, OH, PLEASE, WOULD 
YOU EXTEND NAFTA? 
I SAID WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE 
IT. 
IT'S SUCH A BAD DEAL. 
WHEN I WAS CAMPAIGNING, I'LL 
SAY WE WILL EITHER TERMINATE IT 
OR RENEGOTIATE. 
BUT SO FAR IT LOOKS LIKE WE 
WILL RENEGOTIATE IT. 
THESE DISASTROUS POLICIES WERE 
ON THE BALLOT BOX, IN 2016 AND 
THEY LOST AND THEY LOST BIG. 
THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE. 
>>  
>> IN 2016, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
VOTED TO REJECT THIS CORRUPT 
GLOBALISM. 
THEY VOTED TO RECLAIM THEIR 
INDEPENDENCE AND THEIR PRIDE. 
AND THEY VOTED MOST IMPORTANTLY,
TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
IT'S VERY SIMPLE. 
>> 
>> SOON WE'LL BE CHANGING THEIR 
TUNE! 
KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 
KEEP AMERICA GREAT, SOON. 
WHEN SHOULD WE DO THAT, BY THE 
WAY? 
WAIT A MINUTE. 
SOON WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 
CHANGE. 
BECAUSE WE ARE DOING WELL. 
SO WHEN DO WE CHANGE, MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN TO KEEP 
AMERICA GREAT? 
I DON'T KNOW. 
SOON. 
SOON. 
WE'RE DRAINING THE SWAMP. 
AND THE SWAMP IS FIGHTING BACK. 
BUT DON'T WORRY. 
WE WILL WIN. 
WE WILL WIN. 
WE ALWAYS WIN. 
WE ALWAYS WIN. 
THIS NOVEMBER, YOU NEED TO VOTE 
REPUBLICAN. 
VOTE FOR MATT ROSENDALE AND 
VOTE TO PUT AMERICA FIRST. 
HAVE TO DO IT. 
HAVE TO. 
>>  
>> REPUBLICANS STAND FOR 
STOPPING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, 
FIXING HORRIBLE TRADE DEALS, 
CUTTING YOUR TAXES IN A MAJOR, 
MAJOR WAY, BIGGEST TAX CUT IN 
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
>>  
>> AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE 
GOT AND MORE, -- YOU KNOW WHAT 
THAT IS IN ALASKA, ANWR, WE GOT 
THAT APPROVED AS PART OF THAT 
PLAN. 
WE'LL BE DEFENDING YOUR SOCIAL 
SECURITY WHICH THE DEMOCRATS 
WILL DESTROY. 
AND WE ARE GOING TO BE 
DEFENDING YOUR MEDICARE AND 
PROTECTING THE SAFETY NET FOR 
TRULY NEEDY AMERICANS, PEOPLE 
THAT NEED HELP, THAT ARE 
AMERICANS, NOT FOR PEOPLE THAT 
COME INTO OUR COUNTRY 
ILLEGALLY. 
>> 
>> DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE YOUR 
TAXES, THEY WANT TO RAISE THEM, 
I DON'T GET IT. 
I DON'T THINK I COULD WIN -- 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M GOING 
TO RAISE YOUR TAXES, ALICE, I 
DON'T THINK WE ARE VOTING FOR 
THAT GUY. 
THEY WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. 
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE THEY KNOW 
SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW. 
BLUE WAVE? 
GOING TO RAISE YOUR TAXES, 
GOING TO LET CRIME GO 
THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY, GOING 
TO GET RID OF I.C.E. 
SO AS THE CRIME COMES IN, WE'RE 
GOING TO HAVE NONE OF OUR 
PEOPLE THAT ARE SO TOUGH THESE 
ARE GREAT PEOPLE. 
BUT THESE ARE TOUGH, STRONG, 
THESE ARE WARRIORS. 
THESE ARE WARRIORS. 
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT. 
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT. 
I'M LOOKING AT THESE PEOPLE IN 
THE FRONT ROW, TWO OF WHOM I 
KNOW, THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT. 
I.C.E. 
DOESN'T LIKE -- HEY, IT'S LIKE, 
LET'S GO OUT TO DINNER, THEY 
HAVE DONE AN IN KABUL JOB, SO 
THEY WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES 
-- THEY WANT TO OPEN YOUR 
BORDERS -- AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 
THEY WANT CRIME TO POUR IN 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO 
HAPPEN WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR 
BORDERS. 
HOW ABOUT THE GOVERNOR, THE 
GOVERNORSHIP OF CALIFORNIA? 
HE JUST ANNOUNCED HE WANTS TO 
OPEN BORDERS. 
AND HE WANTS TO LET ANYBODY 
COME IN THAT WANTS TO. 
AND THEN HE WANTS TO PAY FOR 
ALL MEDICAL, ALL SCHOOL, WHAT 
HAPPENS I SAID IF THE ENTIRE 
WORLD DECIDES TO GO TO 
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY GET 
FREE HEALTHCARE, FREE MEDICAL 
CARE? 
AND FREE EDUCATION? 
CALIFORNIA HAS JUST INCREASED 
IN SIZE TO 500 MILLION PEOPLE. 
CALIFORNIA HAS JUST BECOME ONE 
REALLY LARGE PERSON. 
CALIFORNIA, THINK OF IT, HE 
SAYS, I WANT TO OPEN THE 
BORDER, I WANT EVERYONE TO COME 
IN. 
AT THE SAME TIME, FOR ILLEGAL 
ALIENS, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, A 
LOT OF DIFFERENT NAMES, HE 
WANTS TO GET RID OF I.C.E. 
HE WANTS TO CUT DOWN ON LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
AND HE WANTS TO PAY FOR THEIR 
MEDICAL, THEIR HEALTHCARE AND 
EDUCATION. 
BUT I REALLY ASKED -- IT'S ALL 
ABOUT COMMON SENSE, RIGHT? 
I THINK I WON BECAUSE OF COMMON 
SENSE. 
AND BECAUSE, LIKE YOU, LIKE YOU,
YOU, ME, WE'RE SMART. 
WE'RE REALLY SMART. 
BUT I SAID TO MYSELF, JUST 
COMMON SENSE, EVERYONE'S GOING 
TO COME IN. 
I MAY EVEN TO -- I MAY EVEN 
MOVE TO CALIFORNIA TO GET FREE 
HEALTHCARE. 
I MAY MOVE THERE. 
THE LAST TIME DEMOCRATS WERE IN 
POWER, THEY CUT MEDICARE BY 
MORE THAN $700 BILLION TO PAY 
FOR THE SCANDALOUS
OBAMACARE. 
NOW DEMOCRATS WANT TO STEAL 
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM 
MEDICARE, GOING TO RUIN YOUR 
MEDICARE, WATCH, THEY WANT TO 
TURN AMERICA INTO VENEZUELA. 
I DON'T THINK SO. 
>> 
>> DEMOCRATS WOULD DESTROY 
MEDICARE WITH MEDICARE FOR ALL. 
YOU HEARD THAT, MEDICARE FOR 
ALL. 
UNTIL THEY RUN OUT OF MONEY 
WHICH WILL BE LIKE, IN THE 
THIRD DAY. 
AND THEN IT WILL BE MEDICARE 
FOR NONE. 
OR IT WILL BE 110th MEDICARE 
WHAT YOU USED DEGETTE. 
THEY WANT TO ROB OUR SENIORS OF 
THEIR MEDICARE BENEFITS. 
AND THEY WANT TO RAID YOUR 
SOCIAL SECURITY, THEY WILL 
DESTROY YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY 
AND I'M GOING TO SAVE YOUR 
SOCIAL SECURITY, WE ARE NOT 
TOUCHING YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, 
REMEMBER WHEN I RAN? 
REMEMBER WHEN I RAN I SAID I'M 
NOT TOUCHING SOCIAL SECURITY? 
EVERYBODY SAID, EVERYBODY ELSE 
WANTED TO DO THINGS WITH SOCIAL 
SECURITY AND I SAID WE ARE NOT 
TOUCHING YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. 
RIGHT? 
I DIDN'T TOUCH YOUR SOCIAL 
SECURITY. 
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID? 
GROWTH, GROWTH WILL TAKE CARE 
OF IT. 
AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. 
WE ARE GROWING. 
A BEYOND WHAT ANYBODY EXPECTED, 
BEYOND WHAT THOSE PEOPLE 
THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE, WE ARE 
GROWING, IT'S CALLED GROWTH, A 
LOT OF MONEY IS COMING IN. 
DEMOCRATS ALSO WANT OPEN 
BORDERS. 
AND ALL OF THAT EQUALS MASSIVE 
COSTS, MASSIVE, AND MASSIVE 
CRIME AND MASSIVE TEARS, TEARS. 
YOU LOOK AT THE FAMILIES THAT 
HAVE BEEN SO BADLY HURT. 
REPUBLICANS WANT STRONG 
BORDERS, WE WANT TO FINISH THE 
WALL, WE ARE UP TO 3.2 BILLION, 
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON THE 
WALL, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THAT'S 
OKAY. 
GOING TO FINISH THE WALL. 
AND WE'LL GET THAT APPROVED, WE 
ARE GOING TO GET IT APPROVED, 
MOVE IT ALONG, I'D LIKE TO DO 
IT, I COULD DO THAT IN ONE YEAR 
BUT THESE GUYS ARE HOLDING 
BACK, THE ONLY THING DEMOCRATS 
ARE GOOD FOR IS OBSTRUCTION AND 
RESISTING. 
THEIR WHOLE CAMPAIGN IS RESIST, 
RESIST. 
I DON'T GET IT. 
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE NO CRIME, 
WE WON, TO PROTECT AMERICA'S 
GREAT PEOPLE. 
AND IT'S GREAT CITIZENS. 
WE WANT TO PROTECT AMERICAN 
BENEFITS AND WE ARE DOING THAT 
AND I'VE DONE IT. 
IN MARYLAND, THE DEMOCRATIC 
CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR WANTS TO 
GIVE ILLEGAL ALIENS FREE 
COLLEGE TUITION. 
COURTESY OF THE AMERICAN 
TAXPAYER. 
>> 
>> COME ON IN. 
FREE COLLEGE. 
IN FLORIDA, THE DEMOCRATIC 
NOMINEE FOR GOVERNOR WANTS TO 
ABOLISH I.C.E. 
AND RELEASE HUNDREDS OF 
CRIMINALS ONTO OUR STREETS. 
HE WANTS TO ALSO TAKE CARE OF 
THEIR MEDICARE AND EVERY OTHER 
THING YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF, YOU 
NAME IT. 
HE WANTS TO TAKE CARE OF IT. 
AND FLORIDA WILL BE A DISASTER, 
FLORIDA IS ONE OF THE MOST 
SUCCESSFUL STATES IN OUR UNION, 
IT WILL BE A DISASTER. 
YOU HAVE A GREAT CANDIDATE IN 
FLORIDA. 
IT'S CALLED THE REPUBLICAN 
CANDIDATE, RON DeSANTIS. 
>> 
>> RON BOONE GOVERNOR. 
THIS ELECTION, IS A CHOICE 
BETWEEN DEMOCRATS WHO WANT TO 
ABOLISH I.C.E. 
AND REPUBLICANS WHO WANT TO 
ABOLISH MS-13, IT'S VERY 
SIMPLE. 
PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA HOW BAD 
THEY ARE. 
NANCY PELOSI GOT EXTREMELY 
ANGRY AT ME WHEN SHE STARTED 
YELLING, THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS. 
DON'T TALK TO THEM LIKE THAT. 
DON'T CALL THEM ANIMALS. 
REMEMBER, SHE SAID DON'T CALL 
THEM ANIMALS. 
THEN YOU SEE WHAT THEY DO AND 
HOW THEY DO IT AND THE 
VICIOUSNESS OF IT, NO, I'M 
SORRY, NANCY, I'M VERY SORRY, 
HATE TO TELL YOU, NANCY, YOU'RE 
GOING UP THE WRONG TREE, NANCY. 
REPUBLICANS STAND PROUDLY WITH 
THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF 
I.C.E.
, WITH BORDER PATROL, AND WITH 
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
>>  
>> EVERY SINGLE DAY, I.C.E. 
IS CRACKING -- TRACKING DOWN 
DRUG DEALERS, CHILD PREDATORS, 
GANG MEMBERS, AND VICIOUS 
KILLERS. 
AND WE ARE EITHER THROWING THEM 
THE HELL IN JAIL OR GETTING 
THEM THE HELL OUT OF OUR 
COUNTRY. 
AND WE'RE DOING IT FAST. 
>> 
>> THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT 
SAFETY. 
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT JOBS. 
IT'S SAFETY AND IT'S JOBS. 
THANKS TO REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP,
OUR ECONOMY IS BOOMING LIKE 
NEVER BEFORE IN OUR HISTORY. 
THINK OF IT. 
IN OUR HISTORY. 
NOBODY KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO 
HAPPEN. 
IF I WOULD HAVE SAID THIS ON 
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, IF I WOULD 
HAVE USED 4.2, YOU SAW IT WAS 
ADJUSTED UPWARD FROM 4.1, 4.2 
GDP, THE PRESS WOULD HAVE GONE 
AFTER ME, THEY WOULD HAVE SAID 
IMPOSSIBLE. 
JOBLESS CLAIMS JUST FELL TO A 
50-YEAR LOW, 50 YEARS. 
>> 
>> WE'VE CREATED OVER 4 MILLION 
NEW JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION. 
AND LIFTED ALMOST 4 MILLION 
AMERICANS OFF OF FOOD STAMPS, 
THINK OF THAT. 
NOT ONLY IS IT GOOD FOR THEM, 
OUR COUNTRIES SAVES A 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT 
IT'S GOOD FOR THEM, THEY HAVE 
JOBS. 
WE'VE ADDED OVER 400,000 NEW 
MANUFACTURING JOBS. 
THAT THE DEMOCRATS SAY ARE 
GONE. 
AND THAT NUMBER IS GOING TO 
VERY SHORTLY, WITH WHAT'S 
HAPPENING IN CERTAIN AREAS, BE 
WELL OVER 600,000 MANUFACTURING 
JOBS. 
>>  
>> SOMETHING THAT MAKES ME VERY 
HAPPY, MAKES A LOT OF MY 
FRIENDS VERY HAPPY, AFRICAN-
AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT RECENTLY 
ACHIEVED -- THINK OF THIS -- 
THE LOWEST RATE -- THE LOWEST 
EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF 
OUR COUNTRY. 
>>  
>> 
>> REMEMBER I SAID WHAT DO YOU 
HAVE TO LOSE? 
GO WITH ME, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO 
LOSE? 
SO GOOD, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE 
TREMENDOUS AFRICAN-AMERICAN 
SUPPORT. 
BECAUSE THEY SAY AND THEY SEE 
-- BEFORE I SAID WHAT DO YOU 
HAVE TO LOSE? 
NOW I SAY, SEE? 
LOOK WHAT'S GOING ON. 
THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
HISPANIC AMERICAN AND ASIAN 
AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE ALSO 
REACHED THEIR LOWEST RATES IN 
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
HISTORY. 
YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS JUST 
REACHING ITS LOWEST RATE IN 
NEARLY HALF A CENTURY. 
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR AMERICANS, 
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT, WITHOUT A 
HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA, HAS REACHED
THE LOWEST LEVEL
EVER RECORDED. 
THINK OF THAT. 
WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT, RECENTLY 
REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE IN 
NEARLY 65 YEARS. 
WE'VE ADDED 100,000 JOBS. 
BUILDING PIPELINES AND 
SUPPORTING THE PRODUCTION OF 
OIL AND NATURAL GAS. 
>> 
>> WE'VE ADDED SOMETHING GREAT 
TO OUR PORTFOLIO. 
BY INCREASING EXPORTS OF CLEAN, 
BEAUTIFUL COAL, BY OVER 60%. 
60%! 
>> 
>> AND MONTANA KNOWS SOMETHING 
ABOUT COAL. 
THINK OF THAT, OVER 60%, WE 
FREED IT UP, IT'S A GREAT 
NATURAL RESOURCE FOR US. 
I CALL IT CLEAN, BEAUTIFUL COAL,
WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH CALL 
TODAY. 
IN THE FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF 
2018, MONTANA COAL PRODUCTION 
INCREASED BY 2.5 MILLION TONS. 
THAT'S A LOT. 
THAT'S A LOT. 
RIGHT? 
TO CONTINUE THIS INCREDIBLE 
MOMENTUM, WE NEED TO ELECT MORE 
REPUBLICANS, LIKE MATT 
ROSENDALE, YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT. 
BECAUSE IT CAN BE TURNED OFF, 
IT CAN BE TURNED OFF SO 
QUICKLY. 
LAST WEEK, WE MADE ANOTHER 
TRULY HISTORIC ANNOUNCEMENT. 
WE ARE REPLACING NAFTA WITH A 
BEAUTIFUL NEW BRAND, BECAUSE 
IT'S A MUCH DIFFERENT DEAL. 
IT WILL BE CALLED THE 
U.S./MEXICO TRADE DEAL. 
>>  
>> ONE-ON-ONE. 
AND HOPEFULLY CANADA WILL COME 
INTO THAT DEAL AND IF THEY 
DON'T, THAT WILL BE FINE AND IF 
THEY DO THAT WILL BE FINE, 
EITHER WAY WE CAN LIVE, WILL BE 
VERY HAPPY. 
I THINK THEY WILL. 
BECAUSE WE LOVE CANADA, WE DO 
LOVE CANADA. 
THEY'VE TREATED US PRETTY BADLY 
IN TRADE FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS, 
BUT THAT'S OKAY. 
WASN'T MY FAULT. 
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A FAIR DEAL 
WITH CANADA. 
JUST LIKE WE DID WITH MEXICO. 
WE ARE CRACKING DOWN ON UNFAIR 
TRADE PRACTICES. 
EMANATING FROM CHINA. 
AMERICA IS TIRED OF GETTING 
RIPPED OFF. WE ARE GOING TO GET 
A GREAT DEAL FOR OUR FARMERS 
AND RANCHERS AND FACTORY 
WORKERS. 
WE ARE GIVING OUR WORKERS AND 
BUSINESSES A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD
. REPUBLICANS PASSED THE 
BIGGEST PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS, 
AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, TAX 
REFORMS, THE AVERAGE MONTANA 
FAMILY OF FOUR WILL TAKE HOME 
2,281 EXTRA DOLLARS THIS YEAR. 
AND MANY WILL TAKE HOME MUCH 
MORE THAN THAT. 
>> 
>> AND OUR TAX CUTS SAVE FAMILY 
FARMS AND RANCHES AND SMALL 
BUSINESSES FROM UNFAIR ESTATE 
TAX. 
ALSO KNOWN AS THE DEATH TAX. 
SO NOW YOU LEAVE, YOU ARE A 
GUY, BEAUTIFUL FARM, HUSBAND, 
WIFE, AND YOU LOVE YOUR KIDS, 
BY THE WAY IF YOU DON'T LOVE 
YOUR KIDS, DON'T LEAVE IT TO 
THEM, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. 
THE -- THIS WON'T HELP TOO 
MUCH. 
BUT YOU'D LIKE YOUR KIDS TO 
TAKE OVER THE FARM. 
BUT YOU COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE 
THEY HAD TO BORROW A FORTUNE IN 
ORDER TO WORK IT OUT. 
WE GOT RID OF THAT TAX, THAT'S 
A BIG DEAL. 
THAT'S A BIG, BIG DEAL. 
SO YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR SMALL 
BUSINESS OR YOUR FARM OR YOUR 
RANCH AND THEY WON'T HAVE TO GO 
INTO A BIG BANK AND SAY, GEE, 
SHE WEARS, WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT 
IF WE COULD BORROW SOME MONEY --
GEE WHIZ, WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT? 
BY THE WAY WE ARE CANCELING 
OBAMA'S ILLEGAL ANTI-COAL SO-
CALLED CLEAN POWER PLAN, SOUNDS 
SO BEAUTIFUL. 
RIGHT? 
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. 
YOU KNOW, WHEN I DID IT I SAID, 
MAN, THIS IS A TOUGH ONE, 
SOUNDS SO NICE, CLEAN POWER 
PLAN, ONLY ONE PROBLEM, IT 
DOESN'T WORK, DOESN'T WORK, IT 
WILL PUT OUR COUNTRY OUT OF 
BUSINESS. 
IT TOOK AWAY OUR GREATEST 
NATURAL RESOURCES, WE COULDN'T 
DO ANYTHING WITH IT, IT WAS 
SUCH A PRETTY TIME, CLEAN POWER 
PLAN. 
IT'S OUT OF BUSINESS NOW. 
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE CLEAN 
POWER BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE 
UNDER THE CLEAN POWER PLAN. 
AND WE ARE STRONGLY PROTECTING 
OUR PUBLIC LANDS FOR HUNTERS 
AND FISHERMEN. 
AND EVERYONE WHO LOVES THE 
OUTDOORS LIKE MY SON DON WHO 
COMES HERE A LOT. 
>> 
>> MY SON HERE IT COMES -- MY 
SON COMES HERE A LOT, A LOT OF 
YOU KNOW MY SON, HE LOVES 
HUNTING. 
WE PASSED VETERANS CHOICE, 
GIVING OUR VETERANS THE RIGHT 
TO SEE A PRIVATE DOCTOR IF HE 
HAS TO WAIT IN LINE FOR THE 
REST OF HIS LIFE. 
AND WE ALSO PASSED THE LANDMARK 
VA ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. 
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO PASS 
BOTH OF THEM FOR MORE THAN 45 
YEARS. 
I GOT THEM BOTH PAST. 
-- PASSED. 
AND WITH ACCOUNTABILITY NOW OF 
A BAD GOVERNMENT WORKER -- 
ABUSES ONE OF OUR GREAT 
VETERANS, AND WE LOVE OUR 
VETERANS, WE TURN TO THEM AND 
WE SAY, YOU'RE FIRED. 
BOOM! 
>> 
>> WE SECURED A RECORD $700 
BILLION FOR OUR MILITARY THIS 
YEAR AND $716 BILLION NEXT YEAR 
FOR OUR MILITARY. 
>>  
>> AND AT MY DIRECTION, THE 
PENTAGON IS WORKING HARD TO 
CREATE A SIXTH BRANCH OF THE 
UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES. 
THE SPACE FORCE. 
SO IMPORTANT. 
>>  
>> SO IMPORTANT. 
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW, I MEAN, 
WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT 
GOING UP TO THE MOON, GOING UP 
TO MARS, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
YOU NEED IT. 
NOW YOU NEED IT. 
YOU LOOK AT RUSSIA, YOU LOOK AT 
CHINA, YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING 
ON, WHAT THEY'RE DOING, IT WILL 
BE THE BEST IN THE WORLD VERY 
SHORTLY. 
IN SPACE. 
I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES 
FROM THE HORRIBLE IRAN DEAL. 
AND I ALSO RECOGNIZED THE 
CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND OPENED 
THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN 
JERUSALEM. 
BIG DEAL. 
THAT WAS A BIG ONE. 
>>  
>> AND THE EMBASSY IS ALREADY 
BUILT. 
IT'S BUILT ABOUT 20 YEARS AHEAD 
OF BUDGET AND SCHEDULE. 
I WOULD SAY WE ARE PROBABLY 
ABOUT 20 YEARS, YOU KNOW THAT 
STORY, WE BUILT IT REAL FAST, 
WE HAD THE BEST LOCATION. 
THEY WERE ALL LOOKING FOR A 
LOCATION. 
AND A FRIEND OF MINE, THE 
AMBASSADOR SAID, NO, WE ALREADY 
HAVE THE BEST PIECE OF LAND IN 
ALL OF ISRAEL. 
BEST PIECE OF LAND IN 
JERUSALEM. 
AND WE HAVE A BUILDING ON IT, 
LET'S RENOVATE. 
INSTEAD OF SPENDING 1.2 
BILLION, WE SPENT $400,000. 
THAT WAS A SAVINGS. 
>>  
>> AND INSTEAD OF OPENING IN 10 
OR 20 OR 30 YEARS OR MAYBE 
NEVER, WE OPENED IT ABOUT FOUR 
MONTHS LATER. 
IT'S BEEN OPEN FOR A LONG TIME 
ALREADY, A LOT OF PEOPLE WORK 
IN THERE. 
SO WE HAVE THE EMBASSY ALREADY 
OPEN. 
DO I GET CREDIT FOR SAVING A 
BILLION BUCKS? 
NOT REALLY. 
SOMEDAY. 
SOMEDAY. 
YOU KNOW WHEN ABRAHAM LINCOLN 
MADE THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS 
SPEECH, THE GREAT SPEECH, DO 
YOU KNOW HE WAS RIDICULED, HE 
WAS RIDICULED? 
HE TOOK THE HORSE AND CARRIAGE 
UP FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. 
HE RODE IT PARTIALLY IN THAT 
CARRIAGE AND PARTIALLY -- HE 
WROTE IT PARTIALLY IN THE 
LINCOLN BEDROOM WHICH IS 
INCREDIBLE BY THE WAY, IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE, AND HE WENT UP TO 
GETTYSBURG, AND HE DELIVERED 
THAT SPEECH. 
THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS. 
AND HE WAS EXCORIATED BY THE 
FAKE NEWS. 
THEY HAD FAKE NEWS THEN. 
HE WAS EXCORIATED. 
THEY SAID IT WAS A TERRIBLE, 
TERRIBLE SPEECH. 
THEY SAID IT WAS FAR TOO SHORT. 
IT'S NOT LONG. 
MANY OF US KNOW IT. 
BY MEMORY. 
IT WAS FAR TOO SHORT AND IT WAS 
FAR TOO FLOWERY. 
IT WAS TOO FLOWERY, FOURSCORE 
AND SEVEN YEARS AGO, RIGHT? 
TOO FLOWERY. 
AND HE DIED, 50 YEARS AFTER HIS 
DEATH, THEY SAID IT MAY HAVE 
BEEN THE GREATEST SPEECH EVER 
MADE IN AMERICA. 
>> 
>> RIGHT? 
PRETTY GOOD. 
PRETTY GOOD. 
I HAVE A FEELING THAT'S GOING 
TO HAPPEN WITH US. 
IN DIFFERENT WAYS, THAT'S GOING 
 
FOR YEARS, YOU WATCHED AS YOUR 
LEADERS APOLOGIZED TO OTHER 
COUNTRIES FOR AMERICA. 
THEY APOLOGIZED. 
WE'RE SO SORRY. 
WE'RE SO SORRY. 
SO SORRY. 
NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO'S 
STANDING UP FOR OUR COUNTRY. 
I'M STANDING UP FOR AMERICA. 
>> 
>> LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT 
GUY. 
MAN. 
LOOK AT THIS GUY, DO I LIKE 
HIM? 
WOW. 
MAN. 
>> 
>> 
>> WE ARE NOT GOING TO MESS 
WITH HIM TONIGHT, I TELL YOU. 
THANK YOU, MAN, THAT'S COOL, 
THAT'S REALLY GREAT, THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH. 
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR YOUR 
VALUES, WE ARE STANDING UP FOR 
MONTANA, AND WE ARE STANDING UP 
FOR OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM AND OUR 
FLAG. 
>> 
>> BUT IF DEMOCRATS GET BACK 
INTO POWER, THEY WILL TRY TO 
REVERSE ALL OF OUR INCREDIBLE 
GAINS, GAINS LIKE NOBODY 
THOUGHT POSSIBLE. 
SO THIS NOVEMBER, YOU NEED TO 
GET YOUR FRIENDS, GET YOUR 
FAMILY, GET YOUR COWORKERS, AND 
GET OUT AND VOTE REPUBLICAN. 
GET OUT AND VOTE FOR MATT 
ROSENDALE. 
HE'S GOING TO BE A GREAT 
SENATOR AND HE'LL ALWAYS VOTE 
FOR WHAT WE WANT. 
HE WILL ALWAYS VOTE FOR AMERICA 
FIRST. 
FOR MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
MATT WILL ALWAYS BE VOTING FOR 
US. 
WON'T JUST BE TALK. 
LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED 
BUILD THIS COUNTRY. 
AND TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK 
OUR COUNTRY. 
SOMETIMES NOT SO EASILY. 
BUT IT'S HAPPENING AND IT'S 
HAPPENING FAST. 
>>  
>> WE ARE RETURNING POWER BACK 
TO WHERE IT BELONGS. 
BACK TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
OUR AMERICAN ANCESTORS BRAVED 
THE OCEANS, TAMED THE 
WILDERNESS, WON A REVOLUTION, 
AND FOUGHT TO VICTORY IN TWO 
WORLD WARS. 
WE DEFEATED FASCISM, TRIUMPHED 
OVER COMMUNISM, AND WE DELIVERED
MILLIONS INTO FREEDOM. OUR 
ANCESTORS BUILT THE RAILROADS, 
LINKED THE HIGHWAYS, AND THEY 
PROUDLY PLANTED AN AMERICAN FLAG
ON THE FACE OF THE MOON. 
WHICH IS NOT SHOWN IN THAT 
MOVIE. 
THEY DID NOT SHOW THAT IN THE 
MOVIE. 
SEE, WHAT THEY'RE MISSING IS 
THAT THAT MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
A MUCH BIGGER SUCCESS IF THEY 
PLANTED THE FLAG LIKE THEY WERE 
SUPPOSED TO. 
WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF 
GENERATIONS OF AMERICAN PATRIOTS
WHO KNEW HOW TO WORK, KNEW HOW 
TO FIGHT, AND KNEW HOW TO WIN. 
>> 
>> JUST LIKE THEM, WE'RE GOING 
TO KEEP ON FIGHTING AND WE'RE 
GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING. 
WE WILL NOT BEND. 
WE WILL NOT BREAK. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP. 
WE WILL NEVER, EVER BACK DOWN. 
AND WE WILL ALWAYS FIGHT ON TO 
VICTORY. 
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE VICTORY. 
GOING TO KEEP IT GOING. 
BECAUSE WE ARE AMERICA, AND OUR 
HEARTS BLEED RED, WHITE, AND 
BLUE. 
>> 
>> WE ARE ONE PEOPLE, ONE 
FAMILY, AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION 
UNDER GOD. 
AND TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE 
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG 
AGAIN. 
IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE 
AGAIN. 
AND ABOVE ALL, WE WILL MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MONTANA. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU.
