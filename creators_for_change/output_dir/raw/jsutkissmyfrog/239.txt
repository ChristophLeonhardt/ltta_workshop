00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,660
much happier to give my money to this

227
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,150
company who I respect kind of I don't

228
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,430

229
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,530
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i really like packaging a lot more</font>

230

238
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,150
my family favorites must've been using

239
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,610

00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,190
questions about your plans oh well you

245
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">know how many plans that's very awkward</font>

246
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,950
to now continue a conversation with

247
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,970
somebody about your wedding when you

249
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,510
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have about two years which is</font>

250
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">like so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much 2014 which is ages away but</font>

251
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,400
you kind of tab stop lying your stuff

252
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,870
and we've looked at like a venue already

253
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,430
but I don't know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Benny</font>

254
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,710
and if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> won that venue if we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

255
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,060
venue don't let me turn into bridezilla

256
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,830
weddings are weird it's like do you do

257
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,160
the whole let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just invite some people</font>

258
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,479
were like a close people and spend a lot

259
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,070
of time than that day and you know it be

260
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,600
bit worried free<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

261
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,370
wedding and it's you know relaxed and

262
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,539
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to plan do much because</font>

263
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,060
not too many people there or do you do

264
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,380
big wedding for everyone because you

265
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,120
love everybody and you want oil friends

266
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,589
to be there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see the you know because</font>

267
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:36,059
the funnest part for me of a wedding

268
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,440
isn't the game to look at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

269
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,450
night<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the dancing embarrassing</font>

270
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,309
dancing on the you know tacky dance for

271
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,409
it it's the ceremony I like seeing the

272
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:45,089
ceremony<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I want you know other</font>

273
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:46,440
people to get to experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and be</font>

274
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,450
part of the actual marriage not part of

275
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,740
our marriage because that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird</font>

276
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know part of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ceremony because</font>

277
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,130
that's the cool bit

278
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,340
but everything I'm organizing a event

279
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,850
for like 300 plus people which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font>

280
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">it probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be if we did include</font>

281
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,690
everybody including family and you know

282
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,820
you know the night friends like close

283
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,380
friends don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> like people the</font>

284
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,300
peripheral you hardly know like that

285
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,510
that would just be friends like

286
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,860
submission is a massive event mission if

287
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't have the money to like hire a</font>

288
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">wedding planner or something potentially</font>

289
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,690
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if I did have the money to</font>

290
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,430
like hire a wedding planner I don't

291
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I would because I don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

292
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,730
I do it myself and like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of wedding</font>

293
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,810
and those sounds really really bitchy

294
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,910
lot of weddings to me look really tacky

295
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,310
and please right how many providers have

296
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,020
you seen you can't buy the right wedding

297
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,190
dress size and they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like all</font>

298
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,720
that like they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they've sucked</font>

299
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,740
their stomach in but actually their

300
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,030
stomachs just coming over their breasts

301
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,370
line and like out of that what what I

302
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,980
just buy the right size not fooling

303
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,390
anybody we're not gonna sneak backstage

304
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,220
and see the size you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like just</font>

305
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">by the right sides why do you insist on</font>

306
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,360
like instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having a veil you have</font>

307
