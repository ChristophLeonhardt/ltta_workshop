1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
everybody is sad when their side loses

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,560
an election but the day<font color="#CCCCCC"> after we have to</font>

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,870
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're actually all on one</font>

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,820
team this is an intramural scrimmage

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,470
we're not Democrats first we're not

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,210
Republicans first we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> Americans first</font>

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,990
we're Patriots first we all what want

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,890
what's best for this country that's what

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">I heard Mr Trump's remarks last night</font>

10
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:35,360
that's what I heard when I spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> to him</font>

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,230
directly and I was hardened by that

12
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,430
that's what the country needs a sense of

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,710
unity a sense of inclusion a respect for

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">our institutions our way of life rule</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

15
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,660
law and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a respect for each other I hope</font>

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,190
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he maintains that spirit throughout</font>

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,700
this transition and I certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope</font>

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,280
that's how his presidency has a chance

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:00:00,000
to begin
