this is the conscious investor presented by Naveen I'm here with Rekha Unnithan the impact investing portfolio manager for Naveen so you managed a nearly billion dollar portfolio focused on impact investing what exactly is impact investing and how does it differ from socially responsible investing so impact investing is one facet of the socially responsible investing spectrum if you will impact investors are looking for intentional outcome orientation with respect to the investments they choose to make it's providing a certain good or service to a part of the population that may be largely underserved it may be innovation using technology it may be looking at themes like climate change and energy efficiency to create a product or services that doesn't exist today or needs to be improved upon so can you give me some examples of the types of deals that you're looking at for your portfolio yeah I can give you two examples that make up you know big part of our portfolio strategy in the United States affordable housing is a big area focus for us and really it's preserving existing affordable housing stock one in four households in the United States does not have access to affordable housing ie they're paying more than 30% of their income on rents which basically means they're spending less on other important things like education health access to good and healthy food and so affordable housing preservation is taking existing affordable housing stock and keeping it affordable for the long term making those apartments available to families that are working that are fabric of our society creating a safe place for them to live and for those communities to thrive and what is an investment in that look like like who are you and who are you giving money to and what are they doing with it and then how do you measure what success they're having in keeping that housing affordable yeah so an investment in affordable housing is actually investment in the property itself it's finding the operators and developers who are focused on this asset class who believe that there is an attractive investment story there who believe that the real estate itself is very attractive because it is it's built in a way that's sustainable that can be preserved using energy retrofits it's a way to make it more efficient so it's investment it's buying the actual property it's managing the property efficiently it's like I said doing energy retrofits were possible it's also creating a community space and residence services for the tenants so affordable housing will often have underutilized community rooms so if it's a family focused property it's a place where after-school programs can be conducted so the kids getting off the school bucks at 4 o'clock have a place to go if it's a senior focused affordable housing property that's creating ways for them for the seniors to engage both with each other as well as get access to services where it's about you know meals on wheels or libraries or things like that and honey is there a trade-off between how much money you can make out something like that and how much good you can do and how do you define success how do you monitor these investments in all of you we are not making investments that have any conversation about trade-off both opportunities needs to exist so there needs to be an intentional focus on outcome creation in this case retaining existing affordable housing stock and making it available and then financial returns which is a big part in affordable housing is driven by rental income so cash on cash return from maintaining these properties and collecting rents and then over the long term holding these properties and selling them to another buyer who will preserve them right so financial return and impact outcomes for us go hand-in-hand with respect to metrics that we would look to monitor for affordable housing for instance is the percentage of income these tenants are paying for rent the energy retrofits that have been put in place in those properties to make them more efficient the Walk Score and the transit scores of the properties so where are these properties located relative to access to transit good schools etc and can you give me an example of us something else that's in your portfolio that is a good example of being able to make money and also benefit a community inside we're outside the US oh absolutely so 40% of our portfolio is in emerging and frontier markets economies where there's a ton of growth and Financial Inclusion is one theme that really plays out in our portfolio essentially it's providing access to credit savings insurance to marginalized groups so groups that are not part of the mainstream financial systems so one might have heard of the concept of microfinance which is essentially providing credit to groups of women who we believe are credit worthy but don't have access to bank accounts and credit and so that's one type of investment in our portfolio where its group lending its groups of women who take out a loan or responsible for repayment of that loan and then use that for working capital for their small enterprises which they often operate out of their own homes so that's one example of an impact investment another recent investment we made is in the remittance space so migrant populations living would leave their home country some sub-saharan Africa or Southeast Asia and move to develop nations like the US or the UK people like taxi drivers need to send money back home right and average costs of remittance from mainstream remittance providers is seven to twelve percent of cost of funds that's a lot of money that you're giving away to just send money back home so we made recently an investment in an online based remittance provider that basically focuses on channels in sub-saharan Africa and Southeast Asia that is looking to lower the cost of doing this to 4% or some 4% so more money in the pockets of the working poor and really this is enabled by in you know leveraging technology to deliver something that required a bricks-and-mortar approach in the past and how did you come to be in charge of all this how what was your interest in impact investing and when did that start so I grew up in emerging markets I grew up in Bombay and studied economics at Yale and my senior year I took a class in developmental economics which really shaped kind of my curiosity about the secretary that's where I first learned about microfinance I learn about traditional economic development in aid and it's quite kind of this this interest to kind of figure out how do you tie capital to some of the biggest challenges facing our people in our planet so and so I had been searching for ways to get involved in impact investing and at Nuveen you know we helped design basically the portfolio that we've been implementing today and we continue to do in a really innovative work here because now the sector is maturing and a lot more people are at the table having this conversation and we're excited to be part of it and how do you decide what the goals of the portfolio are the goals of the portfolio were designed really to address our ability to do this well where we could play a leadership role in terms of the type of capital we were willing to provide which is long term in nature the risk adjusted returns we needed to see from those portfolios which drove sector selection so some of the sectors are I described before provide those opportunities and frankly it was also the expertise that we had in-house right investing in private equity investing in real estate are things that firm like Nuveen does well and so we thought when we play a leadership role in impact investing it should be an extension of that expertise and do you have any advice for people that want to have an impact but don't have access to say like a private your fund or things like that but want to have a positive impact when they're investing is there anything that they can do to to get over that hurdle and figure out what they're doing yeah absolutely so the UN launched the sustainable development goals in 2016 basically the roadmap for once again challenges and opportunities facing our people in our planet and it has 17 goals that provide frameworks for things that are much needed right so as investors thing to a place capital it's one way to articulate you know where they want to invest is it around issues of hunger poverty you know income inequality sustainable cities so the SDGs the sustainable development goals provide a framework to have the discussion with financial advisors investors and really that is picking up because corporations are talking about it governments are talking about it are so our investors great and last question what do you think people get most wrong about impact investing I think what people get most wrong about impact investing and this is slowly changing is that impact investing must mean giving up return that it's some sort of philanthropic tool we really see impact investing is really being an investment discipline like every other one is you know coming-of-age right it's taking into account material and intentional outcome orientations and while impact investors could choose to have subsidized returns they could also choose to have risk adjusted returns and that's a growing theme you
