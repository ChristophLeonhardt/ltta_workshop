now normally the u.s. press is almost uniformly on the side of the Israeli government whether it's a right-wing government a left-wing government a moderate government the u.s. usually will frame it in and the administration's both Republican and Democratic will frame it largely as there was nothing Israel could do they had to start a war they had to kill Palestinians and in the Palestinians made him do it etc this case to be fair to the rest of the media it has been split and and and there has been a lot of good coverage even on TV saying that yes in this case Doctors Without Borders the United Nations New York Times reporters and all other reporters there indicate that the protesters were largely unarmed and even the stones that some of the protesters were throwing had no prayer of reaching the Israeli soldiers let alone hurting them and people that were near the border whether they were armed or unarmed were mowed down and we had dozens of cash casualties meeting people who were killed in two thousand four hundred wounded so Fox and Friends are of course outraged there would be any balance in the media so they're gonna speak out against it let's watch for the last eight weeks they've been having them along the security fences in Israel and today's supposed to be the last day but you know what yesterday they used the embassy as a great excuse to make a lot of mess so you got twenty seven hundred were injured a lot of people say way to saying what do you mean by injured their doubt that number it's way too high about 130 serious 58 did lose their lives there was sending flaming kites over to Israel starting one wildfire in the end when you go running at somebody's border especially when there's something like this happening with 800 people under attend marking this ceremonial move you got to protect yourself but I'm amazed at how the media's portraying this well many news outlets gave equal or greater coverage to the demonstrations in fact let's just take a look at the papers here in New York the cover the New York Post has the opening of the embassy and then the New York Times Israelis killed dozens in Gaza and then the New York Post daddy's little ghoul fifty-five slaughtered in Gaza but Ivanka all smiles at the Jerusalem embassy unveil now the New York Times headline is fact Israelis did kill dozens that's exactly what happened there like a look at this the New York Times reporting reality we don't like that we don't want to report reality we just want to blame the Palestinians here what he said he said the embassy was used as a great excuse to make a lot of mess the move of the embassy to Jerusalem the Palestinians view is an end to the peace process and negotiations so they basically been told by the us through that symbolic act that they will never get a state and how dare they make a mess and they made a mess by protesting Israel killed 60 of them and all those wounded and injured now my favorite was the flying kite they said oh they said there's a kite was lit on fire and this isn't a lot of the press this is the best that Israeli propaganda can do they're like well I would there was no evidence of any guns or any bombs we try to have that fly and it didn't fly all the reporters said no there's no evidence of that but there was a kite that was on fire a kite a kite they sent a kite over can you believe that think about that for a second they sent a kite they got no weapons man they're throwing stones like they were from two 3,000 years ago they're flying kites that are on fire to try to get inside Israel the other side literally has nukes and they have snipers from firing from 700 meters away and executing people but you're blaming them for the kites there's more this nonsense so the idea was Hamas would try to grab as many headlines as they possibly could while this was going on over at the embassy and they got a lot of attention and now they're taking the Israelis are a lot of heat for the fact that they fired upon these I saw keith Ellison said mainly unarmed people see those look like mainly unarmed people they're throwing rocks and throwing Molotov cocktails they say they're throwing Molotov cocktails and the guy kicks a tear gas canister launched by the Israeli Defense Forces and do they look mainly unarmed no those three four guys you showed don't look unarmed and in fact there were more than well more than those guys there was other guys who were throwing stones as well but there was forty thousand protesters well you didn't show them did you because if you showed them yet they are overwhelmingly unarmed as every reporter on the scene says this is Fox News and then they have the audacity to blame the rest of the press for not covering it factually that is hilarious two easy ways for the young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of our videos
