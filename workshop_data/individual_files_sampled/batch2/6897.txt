during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper Republican representative Jim Jordan from Ohio admitted that he has never heard Donald Trump tell a single lie so this leads us to wonder one maybe Jim Jordan is suffering from some kind of undiagnosed deafness or - Jim Jordan might just be an idiot so take a look at the clip and see Jim Jordan kind of squirm when Anderson Cooper presses him on the issue of whether or not Trump has ever lied but come on I mean you you you got to admit this president has said things which are just a monster ibly not true time and time again I mean the list is a very long run almost on a daily basis I think Andrew McCabe is that said things that aren't true and the Inspector General did I make it right and was and was fired because of that right and so you could say you're very you're very bold and calling on Andrew McCabe not too bold on the president United States it wasn't it wasn't me calling him Kaiba it was his colleagues I mean it was you have heard a lot you haven't heard the president lie I've not heard the president I've been always been square with me that's for darn sure what American people the American people elected him president of the United States what I'm asking you and I'm not and the American people feel like what the treatment he's received from the top yeah I know how you can talk about all of the American people but I'm asking you just yourself have you ever heard the president lie I'm not really so when the Washington Post counts hundreds and hundreds of times none of those are believable to you I've not seen what the Washington Post reported your acident is a president communicated something that wasn't accurate to me I'm not no no no I'm not to you has the president publicly said anything that is a lie well I mean look I I don't know of it nothing comes to mind but look people who talk as much as you and I do I my guess is probably Anderson you may have said something at some point um listen Representative Jordan if you're having a little trouble coming up with any lies that Donald Trump is told let's just go back to the very beginning in the first days of his presidency when he lied about the crowd sighs at his inauguration he then lied about three to five in illegal voters in the 2016 election he lied about other crowd sizes he lies damn near every day he'll just this morning he lied about why he fired James Comey on Twitter completely contradicting what he said last year so yeah if you need an example of a time that Donald Trump lied the easiest thing to do is just go to his Twitter feed and read the most recent tweet Donald Trump has a problem admitting to reality he lies about his poll number lies about his favorability ratings lies about jobs coming back to America and companies coming back to America and middle-class workers getting a tax cut those are all lies that the president has told in the last 24 hours but yeah go ahead and tell Anderson Cooper that you can't think of a single one because that's what a good loyal little Republican does for Donald Trump if you're thinking about subscribing to our channel I strongly encourage you to do that but if you're not thinking about subscribing I would encourage you to start thinking about it and then once you're thinking about it actually go and do it you can see the subscribe button right there on the screen or if you're watching on a different platform go to youtube.com slash the Ring of Fire
