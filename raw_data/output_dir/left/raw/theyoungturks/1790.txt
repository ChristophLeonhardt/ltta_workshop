1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,960
TODAY, BILL COSBY
WAS FOUND GUILTY IN HIS SEXUAL

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,910
ASSAULT RETRIAL.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,579
HE WAS FOUND
GUILTY ON THREE FELONY COUNTS OF

4
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:11,450
AGGRAVATED INDECENT ASSAULT
TODAY IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY,

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,560
PENNSYLVANIA.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,329
THIS COMES FROM
LAST JUNE WHEN HIS LAST TRIAL

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,329
WAS DECLARED A MISTRIAL AND IT
WAS PRETTY SURPRISING FOR A LOT

8
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:21,609
OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED.

9
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:23,409
AFTERWARD, SOME OF THE WOMEN IN

10
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:27,260
THE COURTROOM WERE SEEN SOBBING,
HUGGING EACH OTHER, I THINK WE

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,710
HAVE VIDEO.

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,970
A MEMBER OF THE WOMEN'S
BASKETBALL OPERATION.

13
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:31,970
I'M SORRY.

14
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,860
GUILTY OF ALL THREE COUNTS.

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,080
WE HAD THE VERDICT.

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,300
BILL
COSBY, GUILTY ON ALL THREE

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,300
COUNTS.

18
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,850
I REPEAT, BILL COSBY IS
GUILTY ON ALL THREE COUNTS.

19
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,190
THAT IS THAT INDECENT AGGRAVATED
FELONY ASSAULT, GUILTY.

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,190
THAT

21
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,830
MEANS THEY FOUND HIM GUILTY ON
PENETRATION WITHOUT CONSENT,

22
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,120
THEY FOUND HIM GUILTY OF
PENETRATION WHILE SOMEONE

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,680
WAS UNCONSCIOUS AND ALSO WHILE
SHE WAS INTOXICATED.

24
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,220
AN INCREDIBLE TURN OF EVENTS.

25
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,420
THIS WAS REGARDING ANDREA
CONSTAND SPECIFICALLY BUT IT

26
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,900
HINGED ON A LOT OF PEOPLE
BECAUSE AS YOU'LL REMEMBER,

27
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,210
THERE WERE 50 ACCUSERS AGAINST
BILL COSBY THOUGH CONSTAND'S

28
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,920
TRIAL WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT
RESULTED IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL.

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,630
SO WE ARE TALKING A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

30
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,630
COURTROOM.

31
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,390
IT'S OF COURSE NOT
FILMED BUT KRISTIN FEDEN WHO WAS

32
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,620
THE ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY
IN HER CLOSING REMARKS SAW THAT

33
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,500
BILL COSBY SEEM TO BE SMILING
AND LAUGHING AS SHE POINTED OUT:

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:46,240
ON THE OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
KATHLEEN BLESS ONE OF HIS

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:59,030
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS.

36
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:04,770
SHE IS REFERRING SPECIFICALLY
TO THE ME TOO MOVEMENT, GOING ON

37
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,970
TO SAY:

38
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:30,959
TO 

39
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,140
WHICH HER SIDE SAID, NO.

40
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,870
HE
IS THE CON.

41
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,000
IF YOU DO NOT MIND, I CANNOT
HELP BUT JUMP IN RIGHT NOW.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,270
THIS IS EXACTLY THE REASON WHY A
LOT OF WOMEN DO NOT COME FORWARD

43
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,670
WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED
IN THIS WAY, BECAUSE IT MEANS

44
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,690
THAT YOUR CHARACTER WILL BE
CALLED INTO QUESTION WHEN YOU

45
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,130
ARE IN COURT AND IT IS AN
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT THING TO GO

46
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,450
THROUGH IF YOU ARE IN FACT A
VICTIM OF ANY TYPE OF SEXUAL

47
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,220
MISCONDUCT AND I REALLY DO
COMMEND THE WOMEN WHO WERE BRAVE

48
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,620
ENOUGH TO COME FORWARD AND GO
THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND THAT IS

49
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,470
NOT TO SAY THAT THE WOMEN WHO
DIDN'T GO THROUGH IT OR NOT

50
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,160
BRAVE, BUT IT IS JUST AN
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT THING TO GO

51
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,220
THROUGH AND IN ORDER FOR ANY
JUSTICE TO BE SERVED, YOU NEED

52
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,030
TO TAKE HIM TO COURT AND
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU HAVE TO SIT

53
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,810
THROUGH THOSE DISGUSTING
ARGUMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO

54
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,260
BE MADE BY THE DEFENSE.

55
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,260
THANK YOU.

56
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,709
THAT IS EXACTLY
RIGHT.

57
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,330
THE MOST DISGUSTING

58
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,870
THING IS THAT THEY DISPARAGE
THOSE WOMEN, THOSE WOMEN WHO

59
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,840
WERE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED, PREYED
UPON, THEY DISPARAGE THEM AND

60
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,620
CALLED THEM LIARS AND
OPPORTUNISTS.

61
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,270
IT IS DISGUSTING

62
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,670
AND THEY SHOULD APOLOGIZE BEYOND
THE JUDGMENT.

63
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,670
THIS GUY IS GOING

64
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,340
ON ICE FOR 30 YEARS OR WHATEVER.

65
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,590
SCREW HIM.

66
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,590
HE ABUSE TO THESE

67
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,260
WOMEN AND THIS ONE WOMAN WHO
ACTUALLY GOT TO THE THRESHOLD OF

68
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,360
A TRIAL THE REMEMBER THE STATUE
OF LIMITATIONS IS UP FOR A

69
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
SCORES OF OTHERS.

70
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,159
AS SHE SAID
THERE WERE UPWARDS OF 50 AND

71
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,230
THOSE ARE JUST THE ONES WHO
STEPPED FORWARD.

72
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,210
IT IS A SAD

73
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,810
FACT THAT THE SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR
THE MUDDYING OF THE REPUTATIONS

74
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,161
OF THESE WOMEN AND THEN AFTER A
SOUND JUDGMENT IS REACHED, THERE

75
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:16,548
IS NO APOLOGY FROM THE OTHER
SIDE.

76
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,048
IT IS TRULY SAD.

77
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,219
FOR ME,

78
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,010
TODAY, HAVING WITNESSED WHAT HAD
HAPPENED IN THIS TRIAL, IT WAS

79
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,600
BITTERSWEET.

80
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,680
THE SWEET PART IS SEEING THIS
GUY FINALLY BROUGHT TO

81
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,110
JUSTICE, BUT THE BITTER PART IS
ALL OF THE DAMAGE HE DID TO

82
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,430
THE REPUTATIONS OF THOSE WOMEN
OR TRIED TO DO TO THEM

83
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,430
ALONG THE WAY.

84
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,190
I MEAN THAT WAS THE CRUX OF
COSBY'S LAWYER'S ARGUMENTS WAS

85
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,190
TO

86
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,540
DISCREDIT EACH ONE OF THESE
WOMEN, TO DISCREDIT THIS

87
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,790
MOVEMENT.

88
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,750
SHE KIND OF DID
CHARACTERIZE THEM NEGATIVELY.

89
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,930
SHE DID SAY QUESTIONING AN
ACCUSER IS NOT VICTIMIZING,

90
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,930
SHE

91
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:56,180
CALLED THEM MONEY HUNGRY AND
FAILURES IN THEIR LIVES.

92
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,180
I

93
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,170
THINK THAT IS SHAMING, OR MAYBE
NOT SHAMING SO MUCH AS

94
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,620
SLANDERING.

95
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,139
AND ALSO KEEP IN MIND, THIS
IS NOT A CIVIL LAWSUIT, THIS IS

96
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:11,600
A CRIMINAL CASE AND THESE ARE
WOMEN WHO ARE BRAVE ENOUGH TO

97
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,230
TESTIFY IN A CRIMINAL CASE WHERE
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET MUDDY.

98
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,410
THEY ARE HOPING TO GET JUSTICE
AND LUCKILY IN THIS CASE THEY

99
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,410
DID.

100
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,150
WHAT I ALSO FOUND
INTERESTING WAS THAT THE

101
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,760
PROSECUTOR WAS CONCERNED ABOUT
COSBY POTENTIALLY BEING A FLIGHT

102
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,020
RISK AND ASKED THAT THE JUDGE
NOT GRANTS BAIL AND COSBY

103
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,490
LOST IT.

104
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,770
YOU HAVE THE DETAILS ON THAT BY
ANY CHANCE?

105
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,770
I DON'T.

106
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,930
COSBY LOST AND STARTED
CURSING AT THE PROSECUTOR.

107
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,930
THE

108
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,479
JUDGE ENDED UP DECIDING TO GRANT
BAIL AND SO THE JUDGE DOES NOT

109
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,000
SEE HIM AS A FLIGHT RISK BUT THE
ARGUMENT MADE BY THE PROSECUTOR

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,220
WAS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A PRIVATE
JET AND HE MIGHT TRY TO FLEE,

111
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:58,250
BUT AGAIN, THE JUDGE DID NOT BUY
THAT SO HE WILL BE ABLE TO POST

112
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,780
ELLEN WAIT UNTIL HE GETS
SENTENCE.

113
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,780
HE'S APPARENTLY
FACING

114
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,900
10 YEARS FOR EACH CHARGE.

115
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,900
THAT IS A MAXIMUM SENTENCE I
THINK WAS 80 YEARS.

116
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,900
WAS IT?

117
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,900
I ONLY SAW IT IN ONE PLACE.

118
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,900
MULTIPLE REPORTS INDICATED
THAT EACH CONVENTION

119
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,900
CARRIES UP TO 10 YEARS IN PRISON
SO IT IS 30 YEARS.

120
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,900
BUT HE IS 80.

121
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,900
THEY SAID YOU CAN SERVE
CONSECUTIVELY OR AT THE

122
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,900
SAME TIME.

123
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,900
CONCURRENTLY OR
CONSECUTIVELY.

124
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,900
IT IS NOT CLEAR.

125
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,900
HE DID SURRENDER HIS PASSPORT
JUST AS A FACT SO HE

126
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,900
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY IS ONE IMPORTANT THING

127
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,900
BUT THE OTHER MOMENT AND I LOVE
THAT CAN MENTIONED THIS, DURING

128
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,259
THE SUMMATION WHEN COSBY DID
LAUGH, THAT MOMENT IS A GREAT

129
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:25,430
MOMENT TO SEIZE IF YOU ARE A
PROSECUTOR AND THAT PROSECUTOR

130
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:30,290
DID SEIZE ON IT AND TURN TO HIM
AND SAID AS KIM WAS NOTING, YOU

131
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,510
MAY THINK THIS IS FUNNY MR.

132
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,510
COSBY, BUT THERE IS NOTHING

133
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,750
FUNNY ABOUT THIS AND THAT IS A
MOMENT THAT CAN PIERCE THROUGH

134
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,321
RIGHT AT THE END OF A TRIAL AND
CLEARLY SOMETHING DEAD AND

135
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:42,200
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THAT DID
NOT HER CASE.

136
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,150
EXACTLY DOTS OF THIS CASE WAS
SPECIAL OR MORE SPECIAL BECAUSE

137
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,310
LAST TIME THEY ONLY ALLOWED ONE
OTHER ACCUSER TO TALK ABOUT HER

138
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,590
DEALINGS WITH BILL COSBY.

139
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,440
THIS
TIME THERE WERE FIVE OTHERS AND

140
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,150
THIS WAS TO SHOW THAT COSBY HAD
A PATTERN OF DOING SPECIFIC

141
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,400
THINGS TO HIS VICTIMS.

142
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,610
THEY
INCLUDED JANICE DICKINSON WHO IS

143
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:16,830
THE FORMER, FIRST SUPERMODEL,
JANICE BAKER KENNY, SO LOST IT

144
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,690
WAS ACTUALLY CRYING THROUGH A
LOT OF HER TESTIMONY AND

145
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,060
ACTUALLY CALLED OUT TO COSBY
ACROSS THE COURTROOM AFTER

146
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,210
DESCRIBING, BECAUSE THIS
HAPPENED WHEN SHE WAS 17.

147
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,210
HE

148
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,630
TOOK HER TO HIS HOTEL ROOM TO
HELP HER WITH HER MODELING

149
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,690
CAREER AND SHE CALLED OUT TO
HIM AND SAID, YOU REMEMBER,

150
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,690
DON'T YOU MR.

151
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,690
COSBY?

152
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,690
IN THE MIDDLE OF HER
COURTROOM.

153
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,240
IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL

154
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,900
BUT THOSE WOMEN SEEM TO BE
ELATED WITH THE RESULT ARE.

155
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:47,100
AND I WAS ACTUALLY CONCERNED
ABOUT JANICE DICKINSON'S ROLE IN

156
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,230
THIS CASE BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH
SHE DID TESTIFY AGAINST HIM,

157
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,570
DURING I BELIEVE CROSS
EXAMINATION SHE HAD SAID

158
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,180
SOMETHING ABOUT HOW SHE MADE
THINGS UP ABOUT COSBY AND ONE OF

159
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,610
HER BOOKS AND SO THEY QUESTIONED
HER CREDIBILITY IN MAKING

160
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,819
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST COSBY AS A
RESULT AND THAT MADE ME WORRY

161
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,610
BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE ONE PERSON
MAY HAVE EMBELLISHED THINGS FOR

162
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,260
HER BOOK DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE
OTHER VICTIMS ARE MAKING THINGS

163
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,260
UP.

164
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,060
I DID NOT WANT THAT
UNDERMINE WITH THE OTHER VICTIMS

165
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,039
HAVE GONE THROUGH AND LUCKILY,
BASED ON THESE THREE CHARGES

166
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:26,740
THAT HE IS NOT CONVICTED OF, HER
TESTIMONY IN HER BOOK DID NOT

167
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,000
UNDERMINE.

168
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,699
THEY DID TARGET HER BOOK BECAUSE
THEY SAID YOU DIDN'T SAY THIS

169
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:34,120
HAPPENED IN YOUR BOOK AND THEN
