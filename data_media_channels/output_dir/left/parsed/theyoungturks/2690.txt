WE WERE EXPECTING TO COME IN
TODAY AND TALK ABOUT THE
THIRD DAY OF THE SHUTDOWN OF
GOVERNMENT, BUT INSTEAD WE
HAVE SOMETHING ELSE.
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE WORSE.
A DEAL HAS APPARENTLY BEEN
REACHED BETWEEN REPUBLICANS
AND MOST BUT NOT ALL OF THE
DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE AND
MOST RECENTLY, RIGHT BEFORE WE
WENT LIVE, IN THE HOUSE AS WELL.
BOTH CHUCK SCHUMER WHO WAS
INSTRUMENTAL IN THIS AND
MITCH MCCONNELL HAD STATEMENTS.
MITCH MCCONNELL SAID THIS: I
HOPE AND INTEND THAT WE CAN
REACH A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION ON
ISSUES SUCH AS MILITARY
SPENDING, IMMIGRATION, AND
BORDER SECURITY AND DISASTER
RELIEF BEFORE THE FEBRUARY 8 THE
DEADLINE, AND A DEADLINE THEY
ARE SETTING UP, THEY ARE GOING
TO FUND THE GOVERNMENTAL
UNTIL THEN.
HE SAYS SHOULD THESE ISSUES NOT
BE RESOLVED BY THE TIME THE
FUNDING BILL BEFORE IT EXPIRES,
SO LONG AS THE GOVERNMENT
REMAINS OPEN, IT WOULD BE MY
INTENTION TO TAKE UP LEGISLATION
HERE IN THE SENATE THAT WOULD
ADDRESS DACA, BORDER SECURITY
AND RELATED ISSUES.
HE
FURTHER PROMISED THAT THE FUTURE
IMMIGRATION DEBATE WOULD HAVE A
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WERE
SENATORS FROM BOTH PARTIES COULD
OFFER AMENDMENTS WHICH CERTAINLY
WOULD BE SOMETHING NEW IN THE
SENATE THESE DAYS AND SO
CHUCK SCHUMER IS GETTING A LOT
OF HEAT OVER THIS.
HE WAS ENTHUSIASTIC AND I KNOW
THAT SOME PEOPLE, I WAS
LISTENING TO ANGUS KING, EXCITED
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT
THIS COULD WORK OUT IN THE LONG
RUN, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE INCREDIBLY CRITICAL BECAUSE
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
PILLARS OF THIS IS THAT YOU
NEED TO SORT OF TRUST
MITCH MCCONNELL WHO YOU
SHOULDN'T TRUST ON FAITH
ALONE AND CERTAINLY ON PAST
RECENT EXPERIENCE.
TALK TO SUSAN COLLINS ABOUT HOW
MUCH YOU SHOULD TRUST MITCH
MCCONNELL AND WE ARE BEING ASKED
TO TRUST HIM.
MCCONNELL PROMISED LAST YEAR
FOR VOTES ON HEALTHCARE
WHERE THE DEMOCRATS WOULD BE
ABLE TO DO AMENDMENTS AND
IMMIGRATION, STILL WAITING.
LOOK, THE MINUTE SOMEBODY SAYS
MITCH MCCONNELL PROMISES, THE
CORRECT ANSWER IS LOL, NOT
LIKE OH, MITCH IS PROMISING IT,
THAT WILL PROBABLY COME TO
FRUITION.
HAVING SAID THAT, THIS DEAL HAS
UPSIDES AND DOWNSIDES.
YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED TO HEAR
THAT FROM ME BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS
YELLING AT THE DEMOCRATS TO
TOUGHEN UP AND NOT TAKE CONSTANT
COMPROMISES.
THERE IS A LOT OF THAT IN THIS
DEAL, BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME
UPSIDES TOO SO I WANT TO GIVE
YOU BOTH POINTS OF VIEW.
I'M GOING TO LET JOHN CONTINUE
HERE AND THEN WE WILL BREAK
DOWN WHY IT MAKES SENSE AND WHY
IT DOES NOT.
GOOD POINT.
AS I WAS SAYING, A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE PROSPECT
THAT MITCH MCCONNELL'S WORD IS
GOING TO BE SORT OF THE
IMPORTANT PART IN THIS AND THE
NUMBER OF THE SENATORS WHO
VOTED AGAINST IT, PREDOMINANTLY
DEMOCRATS ALTHOUGH THERE
WERE A COUPLE OF REPUBLICANS
BUT IN STATEMENTS, A LOT OF
THEM ECHOING THIS.
ONE AS AN EXAMPLE IS KAMALA
HARRIS WHO SAID:
THE MAJORITY LEADERS COMMENTS
ARE SHORT OF THE IRONCLAD
GUARANTEE.
I REFUSE TO PUT THE LIVES OF
700,000 YOUNG PEOPLE,
REFERRING TO THE DACA PROGRAM,
IN THE HANDS OF SOMEONE WHO HAS
REPEATEDLY GONE BACK ON HIS
WORD.
YOU CAN FIND SIMILAR
QUOTES LIKE
THAT FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
SENATORS AND WE WANT TO
SHOW YOU THE LIST OF THOSE WHO
DID ACTUALLY VOTE NO ON THIS.
THIS IS THE FIRST SET RIGHT
HERE.
IF YOU BRIEFLY THAT GLAZE OVER
THIS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME
STANDOUTS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT OF
EXPECTED BUT THEN SOME THAT, IF
YOU ARE LOOKING AHEAD TO 2020
SORT OF MAKE SENSE OF SOME OF
THEM WERE BE THERE AND IF WE GO
AHEAD, A FEW MORE THERE.
CHRIS MURPHY, NICE.
AND THEN YOU HAVE MIKE LEE AND
RAND PAUL AS WELL BUT
PROBABLY FOR THE NOT FOR THE
RIGHT REASONS.
A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ON THAT.
LET'S KEEP IT REAL.
1ST OF ALL, ANY VOTE THAT IS A
PROGRESSIVE VOTE, I WILL
TAKE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.
I WHILE WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT
THAT ARE SOME OF THE 2020
CANDIDATES MAKING SURE THAT THEY
ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF
THE PROGRESSIVE BASE YEAR?
OF COURSE.
OF COURSE.
AND GOOD, WONDERFUL.
THERE ARE REAL PROGRESSIVES ON
THE LIST, THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO ARE TRYING TO PLEASE
PROGRESSIVES THAT ARE
LISTED BY THE WAY, IN WASHINGTON
THAT IS FROWNED UPON, THEY
HAD ABOUT THAT WAY.
THERE'S LITERATURE TO THAT THAT
OTHERWISE THEY PROBABLY
WOULDN'T HAVE.
AND IT'S YOU GUYS MAKING THEM
VOTE THAT WAY.
GOOD, PUT ON MORE PRESSURE.
AND THE THIRD PART OF THAT
LIST IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE
PRIMARIES COMING UP.
DIANE FEINSTEIN IS ONE OF THE
MOST CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS
IN THE COUNTRY.
SHE VOTED FOR BUSH'S TAX CUTS
WHEN NOBODY WAS PAYING
ATTENTION, TO REPEAL THE ESTATE
TAX WHEN NO ONE IS PAYING
ATTENTION, THE IRAQ WAR, THE
LIST GOES ON AND ON TO ALL
THIS AND SHE IS IN A PRIMARY IN
CALIFORNIA WHERE THE DREAM
ACT IS PRETTY RELEVANCE AND
HER PRIMARY OPPONENTS ARE
PUTTING HEAT ON HER AND SHE'S
LIKE NO DREAM ACT?
THEN I SAY NO.
GLAD TO SEE YOU WOKE UP BUT THAT
IS PART OF THE MOTIVATION HERE.
ALL GOOD BOTH, I WILL TAKE THEM,
BLESS THEIR HEARTS ARE
A BY THE WAY IT'S ENOUGH TO
MAKE YOU THINK THAT WE
SHOULD HAVE MORE THESE PRIMARIES
A.
MAYBE LONG-TERM IS A GOOD THING
FOR THE PARTY.
GEEZ I WONDER IF THAT'S HOW
POLITICS WORKS?
BEFORE WE GET INTO SOME OF
THE NITTY-GRITTY OF WHAT
CHUCK SCHUMER WAS ABLE TO GET
AND WHAT HE REALLY WAS NOT AND
MAY NOT BE CONCERNED ENOUGH
ABOUT, DONALD TRUMP HAD A
STATEMENT SAYING I AM PLEASED,
GET READY FOR 
THE SPIN.
IF YOU BELIEVE THE UPCOMING
DEAL, OR MEMBER THIS IS
COMING FROM A PRESIDENT WHO IS
SAYING WHATEVER YOU GUYS
GIVE ME APPLE SIGNED UP TO COVER
THAT TWO WEEKS AGO THAT HE
NOW SPENDS AT THE ENTIRE
DISCUSSION IS ABOUT HOW
UNFAIR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS.
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN FOR THE
FUTURE RIGHT THERE AND BY THE
WAY, WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF
SHUTDOWNS LIKE THIS AS IN 2013
WHEN THE DEMOCRATS PUT OUT A
SEPARATE BILL BEFORE THE
SHUTDOWN TO MAKE SURE THAT
MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY GOT
PAID DURING THE SHUTDOWN WHICH
DIDN'T NECESSARILY BE THE
WAY THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN.
THEY TRIED TO DO THE SAME THING
HERE BUT THE REPUBLICANS
WOULD ALLOW ANOTHER SPINNING AS
THE DEMOCRATS TRYING TO
STOP MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY
FROM BEING PAID.
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S ACTUALLY
IN THIS.
WE HAVE A CONTINUING RESOLUTION
THAT FUNDS THE GOVERNMENT
FOR THREE WEEKS WHICH IS
DEFINITELY HOW THE MOST
POWERFUL AND INFLUENTIAL COUNTRY
IN THE WORLD SHOULD CONTINUE
TO FUNCTION, BEING FUNDED AND
THREE WE CAN COMMENCE.
IF WE DON'T HAVE A DEAL ON
DOCK AT THE MEANTIME MITCH
MCCONNELL SAYS THAT HE WILL
BRING IT UP FOR A VOTE ON
THE SENATE ALTHOUGH WE DON'T
KNOW WHAT THAT BILL THAT WILL
BE BROUGHT UP WILL BE AND PAUL
RYAN ISN'T BOUND TO DO ANYTHING
IN THE HOUSE AND WE DON'T KNOW
IF TRUMP IS OR IS NOT GOING
TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT DEBATE OR
WHAT HIS POSITION MIGHT BE
THAT I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS WHAT
HIS POSITION MIGHT BE.
THE PLUS SIDE I GUESS AT LEAST
IS THAT IN NO PART OF THE DEAL
DID THEY MAKE ANY, DID THEY GIVE
AWAY THE WALL FUNDING OR CHANGES
FOR LEGAL IMMIGRATION OR
ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THE PLUS
SIDE, THE ONE GOOD THING IS THAT
THEY DID GET SIX YEARS OF
FUNDING FOR CHIP.
WE'VE BEEN WAITING MONTHS FOR
THIS DIVE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE
THAT THEIR KIDS ARE ON CHIP AND
THEY ARE WORRIED THEY'RE
GOING TO BE TURN OFF THEIR
INSURANCE.
NOW WE DON'T HAVE TO GET A
FUNDED ONE MONTH AT A TIME
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
6 YEARS OF FUNDING WHICH IS
SIGNIFICANT.
IT IS.
LOOK, I KNOW A LOT OF
PROGRESSIVES ARE UPSET
ABOUT INEZ USUAL, TO NOT INCLUDE
THE DREAM ACT.
I'M GUESS I'M NOT AS UPSET AS
OTHER PEOPLE IS BECAUSE I'M
NOT SURPRISED.
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A LOT MORE
HOPE THAN I DO.
THEY'RE LIKE I REALLY THINK
CHUCK SCHUMER IS GOING TO
DELIVER.
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
BUT TO BE FAIR TO CHUCK SCHUMER
AND THE OTHER NEGOTIATORS HERE,
IT IS ONLY A THREE WEEK
EXTENSION AND AT LEAST CHIP IS
OFF THE TABLE.
NOW I AM NOT UNAWARE OF HOW WE
GOT HERE.
BACK IN SEPTEMBER THE
REPUBLICANS TOOK TWO HOSTAGES.
ONE WAS CHIP.
IT WAS BIPARTISAN SINCE ITS
CREATION IN 1997.
IN FACT ONE OF ITS CREATORS IS
ORRIN HATCH OF ALL PEOPLE.
TED KENNEDY AND ORRIN HATCH.
AND CHIP HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY
SUCCESSFUL.
NOW CHILDREN ON CHIP HAVE AS
GOOD AS INSURANCE IF NOT
BETTER THAN THE PRIVATE MARKET
AND IT HAS REDUCED SICKNESS
AMONG CHILDREN.
IT IS WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF
GOVERNMENT SUCCESS.
THAT IS WHERE THE REPUBLICANS
TURN AROUND AND GO WE MUST THINK
ABOUT KILLING IT.
INCLUDING ORRIN HATCH.
NOW THE TIMES OF GOTTEN MUCH
MORE VICIOUS AND WHETHER THEY
WANTED TO KILL IT OR NOT,
ULTIMATELY, THIS IS THE
BEGINNING OF THAT PROCESS, THE
MORE IMPORTANT THING SHORT TERM
WAS TAKEN HOSTAGE SO THAT WHEN
YOU GIVE IT BACK TO THE REPUBLIC
THE DEMOCRATS COUPLE MONTHLY TO
GIVE YOU THE WHOLE BUDGET AND
THE OTHER HOSTAS THEY TOOK WITH
DOCTOR SO TRUMP SAID THAT'S IT,
WERE NOT PROTECTING THE DREAMERS
ANYMORE, WE MADE THAT DECISION
UNILATERALLY AND SINCE SEPTEMBER
THOSE TWO THINGS THAT WERE
BIPARTISAN AND WERE APPROVED ALL
ALONG FOR ALL OF THESE YEARS ALL
OF A SUDDEN BECAME PART OF THE
NEGOTIATION SO NOW THE DEMOCRATS
ARE FIGHTING LIKE HELL TO TRY TO
GET BACK TO THE STATUS QUO OF
SEPTEMBER 2017 WHEN TRUMP WAS
ALREADY IN CHARGE.
THIS IS HOW THE REPUBLICANS PLAY
THE GAME.
ONE HOSTAGE AFTER ANOTHER.
CHILDREN MIGHT LOSE THEIR HEALTH
INSURANCE?
THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS
REACTION TO THAT.
WAY, IS A DONOR CHILDREN?
NO?
THEY DON'T CARE.
DREAMERS.
YOUNG KIDS WHO ARE DOING WELL
IN AMERICA WHO DO NOT EVEN
KNOW THE COUNTRY THEY CAME FROM.
WHAT DO THE REPUBLICANS CARE?
THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THAT AT
ALL.
THAT IS WHY THEY DON'T MEAN
TAKING HOSTAGES WHEREAS A LOT OF
DEMOCRATS DO MINDED THAT'S WHY
THE REPUBLICANS KEEP DOING IT.
THE WAY THAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO
WORK AS THE MANY THEY TAKE
THE HOSTAGE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING
TO WORK AT AND GO LOOK AT
THESE MONSTERS WHO JUST ENDED
THIS INSURANCE PROGRAM FOR KIDS.
LOOK AT HOW SUCCESSFUL IT WAS
NATION FOR LITTLE KIDS TO
HAVE CHIP THAT ARE NO LONGER
GOING TO GET HEALTH
INSURANCE AND THAT MIGHT DIE.
INSTEAD, DEMOCRATS DO NOTHING,
PLEASE GIVE IT BACK TO US.
NOW I'M ACTUALLY A LITTLE
EXCITED WE GOT CHIP BACK
AND FOR JUST A THREE WEEK
EXTENSION.
WE GOT HALF THE HOSTAGES BACK.
UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS DAY AND
AGE THAT'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS
DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP CAN DO.
LOOK OVERALL, AFTER SPENDING
THE DAY GETTING UPDATES ON THIS
AND FINDING OUT, IS ELECTION
GOING TO PASS AS ORIGINALLY THAT
WHITE HOUSE WAS AGAINST IT AND
THEY WERE FOR IT, NOW IT LOOKS
LIKE IT PASSED THE HOUSE DUST I
HATE THE HOT TAKES.
HIT THE UNINFORMED KNEE-JERK
HOT TAKES THAT THERE WERE
PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO DECLARE
VICTORY WHEN THEY SOUGHT
REGARDLESS OF THE DETAILS.
THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING
TO DAMN IT REGARDLESS OF THE
DETAILS.
BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DOES
ORBIT, I THINK THESE PLUSES
ARE GOOD, BUT, I THINK THAT THE
DEAL LOOKS BAD AND IS BAD
WHICH ARE DIFFERENT THINGS FOR
BOTH OF THEM ARE BAD.
I DON'T THINK THEY THAT THEY
SHOULD'VE DONE THIS EVEN THOUGH
THERE ARE SOME GOOD THINGS IN
HERE, I THINK THAT CHUCK SCHUMER
AND SOME OF THE OTHER DEMOCRATS
EITHER HAD SO LITTLE RESPECT FOR
THEIR OWN ABILITY TO FOR
SOMETHING BETTER OR JUST A FEAR
THAT AN ONGOING SHUTDOWN WOULD
MAKE THEM LOOK BAD THAT THEY
FELT THE NEED TO BLINK AND I
DON'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO MAKE
THEM LOOK BAD, I THINK THEY
COULD'VE HELD OUT FOR LONGER AND
LOOK, BEST CASE SCENARIO, MIXED
IN WITH WORST-CASE SCENARIO SO
REGULAR SCENARIO, AND THREE
WEEKS, WE MIGHT GET DOCK A
OR IN LESS THAN THREE WEEKS.
THAT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE REALLY
HAVE TO WAIT AND FIND OUT
THAT ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY KNOW
FOR SURE THE MONTH WHERE WE
ARE GOING TO BE IS LENGTHY
BECAUSE NOBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS.
DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T KNOW, CHUCK
SCHUMER DOESN'T KNOW THAT
WE HAVE TO SEE.
THIS COULD'VE BEEN WORSE BUT IT
COULD'VE BEEN BETTER AND I
THINK THAT THIS IS THE SORT OF
THING THAT CHUCK SCHUMER
AND THE OTHER DEMOCRATS IN
LEADERSHIP DO IT, DOES IT
JUST HAD THEM NOW, LINGERING
HURT BECAUSE WHETHER IT IS
IN THREE WEEKS A TRUCK, IT LOOKS
LIKE A BETRAYAL RIGHT NOW.
I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT
THIS.
AS I JUST TOLD YOU, I THINK IT
IS THE BEST THAT DEMOCRATIC
LEADERSHIP CAN DO.
IT IS NOT THE BEST WE CAN GET,
NOT EVEN MILES FROM THAT.
SO IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY SHOULD
HAVE DONE, I AGREE WITH JOHN.
DACA PULLS ANYWHERE BETWEEN 70
AND 80% DEPENDING ON THE WHEN
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT
RIGHT NOW THERE'S A 20
POINT GAP ON WHO PEOPLE WOULD
BLAME, THEY WOULD BEEN
BLAMED THERE PUBLICANS AND TRUMP
THAT YOU CAN'T ANSWER BUT A
SITUATION AND THAT POLITICALLY.
WHERE THE EXCUSES THE DEMOCRATS
USED WAS THAT WE HAVE A 14 POINT
LEAD GOING INTO THE 2018
ELECTIONS ON GENERIC BALLOTSÖ
BUT, THAT'S IN AND.
BECAUSE WHEN THEY ARE DOWN, I'VE
BEEN COVERING IT FOR OVER
20 YEARS, THE DEMOCRATS GO, BUT
WE CAN'T BECAUSE WE'RE DOWN
IN THE POLLS AND THIS WILL MAKE
US LOOK BAD.
IF YOU ARE DOWN IN THE POLLS YOU
CAN'T FIGHT, IF YOU ARE UP
IN THE POLLS YOU CAN'T FIGHT.
WHEN DO YOU FIGHT?
AND THE ANSWER WITH DEMOCRATIC
LEADERSHIP IS ALMOST ALWAYS,
NEVER.
RESISTANCE IN THEIR CASE
APPARENTLY IS FUTILE.
IT IS TINY,
MICROSCOPIC RESISTANCE.
THE CORRECT THING TO DO WOULD
BE, I DON'T THEY HEARD US.
TRUMP LIKES TO SHOUT, OKAY, WE
CAN SHOUT BACK, BUT WE
DIDN'T STUTTER.
NO DREAM ACT, NO BUDGET.
WE'RE DONE.
AND SO THAT IS THE CONVERSATION
WE'RE HAVING WE'RE NOT GOING
BACK TO THE TABLE SO YOU CAN GO
SCREAM ALL YOU WANT, YOU CAN
CALL OTHER COUNTRIES AND OTHER
PEOPLE ANY NAME YOU LIKE BUT WE
ARE NOT, THERE'S NO DEAL BECAUSE
WE ACTUALLY FIGHT FOR VOTERS.
HOW WOULD THAT BE OR WE FIGHT
FOR AMERICANS, WE FIGHT FOR
OUR SIDE.
HOW GREAT WOULD THAT BE.
BUT THE DEMOCRATS NEVER HAVE
THAT COURAGE BECAUSE THEY VIEW
THEIR CONSTITUENTS IS NOT THERE
VOTERS BUT THEIR DONORS SO
WHY DOES CHUCK SCHUMER ACTUALLY
PANIC?
HE IS ON THE PHONE 4 TO 5 HOURS
A DAY RAISING MONEY.
ALMOST EVERYONE HE IS ON THE
PHONE WITH IS A MILLIONAIRE.
ALMOST ALL OF THEM HAVE A LOT OF
MONEY IN THE STOCK MARKET.
ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE PROBABLY
TELLING HIM, HEY, WRAP THIS UP.
IF THIS HURTS THE MARKETS, IT
HURTS ME WHICH HURTS YOU.
WRAP IT UP ALREADY.
