I'm gonna give you my predictions for 2018 on the biggest news stories of 2017 now these are my predictions based on events over the past year my analyses the way we've seen things shake out and resolve and what sources close to the events we'll be discussing are telling me these are only my predictions so there's not gonna be any supporting evidence because we don't know what's gonna happen but let's go on the way we've seen things resolved what we're gonna do is throughout the year I'm gonna grade myself on these predictions and at the end of 2018 we're gonna score my report card and I'm hoping to get an A plus plus because hey what I do let's talk about Hillary Clinton and her team are they gonna face justice well Hillary Clinton probably not and I hope she does and there's a part of me that's slightly optimistic my prediction is that Hillary Clinton personally yeah I can give it a 25 to 30% chance she'll face some kind of justice with the current DOJ leadership with Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein running DOJ know if that changes I'm gonna bump that number and depending on who the new Attorney General is I'm gonna modify that prediction and hopefully I can bump that into the 70 to 80% range of likelihood now I do put do put the probability of Gerald Mills and Huma Abedin facing some kind of criminal justice issue in 2018 at 50% maybe a bit over 50% and that number will skyrocket in the 8090 percent range if we have a change at the Department of Justice over at FBI I predict Christopher raise stays right where he is Andrew McCabe is gone Andrew McCabe is already internally a goner and I predicted he's not already uh quietly fired and they're just letting him bite his time he's going to either be retiring or severed from the FBI early into 2018 but again that deal could have already been cut we don't know we simply don't know I believe that Peter stroked the agent with the damning text message about that Trump will face internal punishment because I think once the inspector general's report is released it's gonna be be very busy it's gonna be very very hard the backpedal from that report and what I'm told by sources and federal law enforcement is that Horowitz Michael Horowitz the DOJ Inspector General well this guy doesn't pull punches with the federal law enforcement agency he has nothing to prove except that he's not a puppet there's nothing to prove except that he is truly independent and I have 50 percent confidence that he'll do his job properly and that he'll put onto paper that his report will prove what most of us simply know by instinct and common sense so I give it a 50% chance we're gonna see real punitive punishments for the McCabe's and the strokes now I give it a hundred percent that culture within the FBI is going to have to change and that Christopher is going to do some dramatic things who reinstall public confidence in the FBI because right now there is ZERO public trust in the Department of Justice and in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and in the United States of America that's a very very dangerous thing when our two premier law enforcement agencies on the on the investigatory and prosecutorial sides have no public confidence in them whatsoever Oh Christopher Rea has to use something to restore that public confidence and I put them down that number at about a hundred percent I have 20 percent confidence at best that Robert Muller will go away quietly I have a hundred percent confidence that Robert Muller will find no Russia collusion in 2018 or in 2019 or 2020 or in 2120 is there was no collusion with Russia but with 100% certainty I can say there is not going to be any bombshell drop that President Trump or anyone close to him colluded with rush or that anyone colluded with Russia and even if they did collusion is not a crime there is no federal statute that criminalizes collusion if that being said I predict nothing even remotely resembling that happened I put that at a hundred percent however I'd put it 20 percent the fact that Muller will go quietly he's going to drop something I put it 80 percent he'll drop something damning or politically damaging or what he thinks is politically damaging on Trump robably something related it Trump's tax returns which is a very sad thing that Muller can act ethically as a quick aside I spoke to a decades-long FBI veteran and told me this narrative that Muller is a man of integrity is all nonsense it's all other and complete nonsense Robert Muller is one of the most petty thin-skinned people I've ever come across he ruined careers over minor personal issues the man cannot be told he's wrong he cannot accept that he's wrong and if anyone dares point something out that he did wrong he destroys them he destroys their career these were agents I was told this by a d1 agent with a long history about agents that were decorated even Awards by Muller himself and they dared disagree with him on something minor he moved in and destroyed them right their careers let them know they would go no further not a decent die these are non-political non agenda driven rank-and-file people within the FBI so I put it out a hundred percent Muller will find nothing damning on Team Trump because remember he's only got processed crime so far and he got manna Ford and gates on old financial crimes unrelated the campaign I predict I'll find nothing material on Team Trump 100% I put that 100% I predict in 2018 our economy will continue to soar I think will consistently approach 4% growth job growth will continue the Dow will continue to remain strong and America will become prosperous again America is already becoming great again I predict in 2018 that when we'll put North Korea in check I don't think we go to a shooting war with North Korea they know they can't win it I predict in 2018 we will further decimate Isis to a point where they were a shell of them former above their former selves and I predict that will be done that will be done early into 2018 early in the 2018 the Trump will do something and literally around a year that Obama couldn't do in half a decade I predict that will then move on to Al Qaeda and al Shabaab and Boko Haram and will really start to decimate these global terror networks unfortunately I also predict that Europe will see an uptick in terror attacks because their appeasement policy with migrants and I predict the United States will become much safer due to Donald Trump's America first national security strategy combined with is outstanding so far outstanding performance on border security ice Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents tell me they've never been busier their boss Tom Holman says that Trump is one of the best presidents he's ever come across with regards to border security in this guy excuse me has been around since Reagan but I predict our nation will continue to become more prosperous and safer i predict the intangibles like american exceptionalism coming to the forefront eat create ism i'm back during the Obama years had to be embarrassed to say we were conservative we had to be embarrassed to say we were Republicans we had to be embarrassed to admit that we loved our country no more Ameri might come back to where it was during World War two in terms of national pride and our stature around the world is already coming back I predict in 2018 that will only grow stronger just look at Donald Trump's 2017 China trip when Obama went to China they made him walk down the service entrance at the back of Air Force One when Trump got there they rolled out the red carpet at marching bands the world respects Donald Trump because they know he will not trifle with them they know that if they get out of hand Donald Trump is going to put them in their place so I predict America will once again become a global economic and military leader when you combine that with Donald Trump eradicating nation-building and and promoting an America first national security strategy would become even stronger they're not meddling needlessly for the globalist agenda were more worried about securing and making our nation the richest healthiest most powerful nation on earth I predict that we're going to do pretty well in the midterms because of all these things is it all saying that goes back to the Bush 41 administration it's the economy stupid well tax reform and deregulation have our economy soaring like I've told you in previous segments venture capital and private equity is gonna come back into the markets new companies are gonna spring up we haven't yet seen the next Google next Facebook the next Twitter the next Amazon but they're out there and there's an investment bank somewhere there's a venture capital from a private equity firm that's investing in them right now and we're gonna see those companies pop up and I suspect that's going to happen and it's gonna start happening in 2018 so I think our economy is only gonna get stronger and leading into the midterm when you combine this this soaring economy and the new national security strategy Republicans are gonna be positioned pick up seats in the House and hopefully take every one of the ten Democratic Senate seats that are up for grabs in states that Donald Trump won handily in the 2016 election and that to me would be the greatest 2018 I don't get ahead of myself but that would be the greatest 2018 Christmas present for all of us wouldn't it to pick up a supermajority in the Senate and and close to a supermajority which we don't really need in the house we've got it but close to full and total control of the house the only thing that would be better that would be better would be a conservative speaker and we might get that present as well because Paul Ryan said he's retiring and if we can pick up all or most of those 10 outstanding Democratic Senate seats in state Donald Trump one they've got more seats in the house and get a conservative in the speaker's office real conservative a Speaker of the house not a RINO like Paul Ryan while 2018 will be as spectacular as 2017 has been or conservatives again I hope I'm right we're gonna grade me periodically throughout the year and then a rat right around this time next year we're gonna we're gonna score my report card I'm like I said hopefully it's an A plus plus plus Merry Christmas Happy Hanukkah happy holidays Happy New Year I want to keep bringing you these segments throughout the new year and not only I'm gonna bring them to you I'm gonna be bringing
