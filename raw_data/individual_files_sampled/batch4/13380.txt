God gives us the power to choose just as he gave Adam and Eve the power to choose he also gives us the power to choose and though they chose wrongly and we inevitably suffer the consequences of that wrong choice still we have the power to choose rightly now you can't help it if you were born to a broken family divorced parents abusive father whatever but you can help carrying that on you can help it if you make the same choice your likelihood of making the same choice may be increased because your parents were terrible but you don't have to make the same choice you could make a different choice and if you end up in the same situation you know if your parents were abusive terrible and then you end up abusive and terrible I think your parents deserve a lot of the guilt and blame for that because they set you on that course but you also deserve 100 percent of the guilt and blame because in the end you still made a choice
