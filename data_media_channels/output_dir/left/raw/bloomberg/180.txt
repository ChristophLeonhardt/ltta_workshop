00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,220
On March 22nd 2016, two suicide bombers blew
themselves up at Brussels' Zaventem airport.

2
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:18,560
11 people were killed and more than 100 injured.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.

3
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,349
Air travel has always been a target
for terrorism. Since aviation began, there's

4
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:29,869
been more than 20 attacks on airports and
more than 100 attempted airline bombings.

5
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:35,670
And with increasing risk comes increased security,
most notably after the attacks of September 11th.

6
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,620
Airport security prevented liquids over
certain size on board. They enforced shoe checks.

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:48,190
They even started using body scanners.
Since 9/11 the positioning of the security

8
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:54,120
cordon as it were has really been at that
crossover between what we call the landside

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,500
of an airport that anyone can access and airside.
That means that anyone entering the airside

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,220
area and subsequently going onto a plane has
been scanned, searched, but what it's done

11
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:13,749
at the same time is leave large areas of the
airport essentially unprotected. Airports

12
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:18,640
in Tel Aviv, Nairobi, Mumbai: they all have
security checks before entering the terminal

13
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,920
building. There are certainly experts who
suggest that all that does is cause large

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,659
numbers of people to queue on the street in
just the place where they're potentially most

15
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:37,719
vulnerable; that you'll simply swap bombings
for drive by shootings. In other words, you'll

16
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:43,119
create a bottleneck and that will still put
people at risk. There's not only the question

17
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:49,899
of whether or not you simply move the terrorist
threat to another area; there are also costs

18
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:54,299
involved. Costs to the airports themselves.
But there are certainly also costs in terms

19
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,659
of time and the length of the passenger journey
and whether you actually make people not want

20
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:05,119
to even travel anymore. So no matter what
security officials decide there's always going

21
00:02:05,119 --> 00:00:00,000
to be a toss up between the need for security
and the hindrance of travel.
