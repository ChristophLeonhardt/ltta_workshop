WERE WILLING TO ALLOW THIS KIND OF RESOLUTION TO GO THROUGH.

18

00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,844
-- ATTENTION TO IT. BUT THEY COULD HAVE HAD A ROLL CALL VOTE

39
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,012
COULD HAVE HAD A ROLL CALL VOTE AND VOTED AGAINST IT.

40
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,146
AND VOTED AGAINST IT. >> THEY COULD HAVE. I DON’T

41
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,015
>> THEY COULD HAVE. I DON’T THINK THEY WERE PREPARED TO GO

42
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:34,151
THINK THEY WERE PREPARED TO GO THAT FAR. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE

43
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,419
THAT FAR. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY, HEY, I SUPPORTED

44
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,954
TO SAY, HEY, I SUPPORTED RESOLUTION IN FAVOR OF NATO, BUT

45
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,823
RESOLUTION IN FAVOR OF NATO, BUT THEY DON’T WANT TO SAY IT TOO

46
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,057
THEY DON’T WANT TO SAY IT TOO LOUDLY, LESS THE PRESIDENT

47
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:42,560
LOUDLY, LESS THE PRESIDENT HEARS. YOU KNOW, THIS IS

48
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,661
HEARS. YOU KNOW, THIS IS UNFORTUNATELY THE HISTORY IN THE

49
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,030
UNFORTUNATELY THE HISTORY IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF, WHICH IS

50
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:50,234
LAST YEAR AND A HALF, WHICH IS ALMOST COMPLETE CAPITULATION IN

51
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,769
ALMOST COMPLETE CAPITULATION IN THE GOP AND IN THE SENATE AS

52
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,638
THE GOP AND IN THE SENATE AS WELL. THIS COMES AS I THINK ONE

53
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:55,473
WELL. THIS COMES AS I THINK ONE OF THE MOST PAINFUL REALIZATIONS

54
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:56,841
OF THE MOST PAINFUL REALIZATIONS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. AND

55
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:59,276
OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. AND THAT IS NOT WHAT A TERRIBLE

56
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:00,044
THAT IS NOT WHAT A TERRIBLE PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WOULD

57
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,580
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WOULD TURN OUT TO BE, WHICH WAS ALL

58
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,683
TURN OUT TO BE, WHICH WAS ALL TOO PREDICTABLE, BUT HOW

59
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:14,492
TOO PREDICTABLE, BUT HOW COMPLICIT THE GOP WOULD BE. AND

60
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:17,829
COMPLICIT THE GOP WOULD BE. AND I THINK THAT HAS PUT OUR

61
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:19,063
I THINK THAT HAS PUT OUR DEMOCRACY AT REAL RISK BECAUSE

62
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:22,867
DEMOCRACY AT REAL RISK BECAUSE IN THE FACE OF REPEATED ASSAULTS

63
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:25,403
IN THE FACE OF REPEATED ASSAULTS ON OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS,

64
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:27,105
ON OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, THE REPUBLICAN REACTION HAS BEEN

65
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:29,474
THE REPUBLICAN REACTION HAS BEEN EITHER TO RUN AWAY OR REMAIN

66
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:29,774
EITHER TO RUN AWAY OR REMAIN MUTE.

67
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:31,209
MUTE. >> I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION

68
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,378
>> I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD TO

69
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:36,414
TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY, INCLUDING HIS ATTACK ON A

70
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:38,483
SAY, INCLUDING HIS ATTACK ON A NATO MEMBER GERMANY SAYING THEY

71
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,418
NATO MEMBER GERMANY SAYING THEY WERE BASICALLY COMPLETELY

72
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:41,686
WERE BASICALLY COMPLETELY DOMINATED AND UNDER THE CONTROL

73
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:42,186
DOMINATED AND UNDER THE CONTROL OF RUSSIA.

74
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:44,021
OF RUSSIA. >> WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT IT

75
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:45,723
>> WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT IT REMINDED ME OF, FRANKLY, IS THAT

76
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,892
REMINDED ME OF, FRANKLY, IS THAT DEBATE EXCHANGE WITH HILLARY

77
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,726
DEBATE EXCHANGE WITH HILLARY CLINTON WHERE HILLARY CLINTON

78
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,897
CLINTON WHERE HILLARY CLINTON SAID, YOU KNOW, VOTERS DON’T

79
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:55,500
SAID, YOU KNOW, VOTERS DON’T WANT A PUPPET FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN

80
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,335
WANT A PUPPET FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN AND TRUMP’S REACTION WAS, YOU’RE

81
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:59,504
AND TRUMP’S REACTION WAS, YOU’RE THE PUPPET. I KNOW YOU ARE BUT

82
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,439
THE PUPPET. I KNOW YOU ARE BUT WHAT AM I KIND OF GRADE SCHOOL

83
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:03,041
WHAT AM I KIND OF GRADE SCHOOL RESPONSE. WE SEE THAT HERE WITH

84
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:07,812
RESPONSE. WE SEE THAT HERE WITH HIM ATTACKING MERKEL AND GERMANY

85
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:10,148
HIM ATTACKING MERKEL AND GERMANY FOR BASICALLY BOWING BEFORE

86
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:12,017
FOR BASICALLY BOWING BEFORE RUSSIA WHEN, IF THERE IS ANY

87
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:14,452
RUSSIA WHEN, IF THERE IS ANY LEADER AROUND THE GLOBE THAT HAS

88
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:16,688
LEADER AROUND THE GLOBE THAT HAS BOWED BEFORE PUTIN IT IS DONALD

89
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:18,857
BOWED BEFORE PUTIN IT IS DONALD TRUMP. BUT THIS IS VERY MUCH THE

90
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,025
TRUMP. BUT THIS IS VERY MUCH THE TRUMPIAN STRATEGY, WHICH IS

91
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:22,127
TRUMPIAN STRATEGY, WHICH IS WHATEVER IS ACCUSED OF YOU, YOU

92
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:24,262
WHATEVER IS ACCUSED OF YOU, YOU LEVEL THAT ACCUSATION AGAINST

93
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:25,864
LEVEL THAT ACCUSATION AGAINST OTHERS. THE OTHER THING THAT

94
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:27,332
OTHERS. THE OTHER THING THAT LEAPT OUT AT ME ABOUT THE

95
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:29,067
LEAPT OUT AT ME ABOUT THE PRESIDENT’S PARTICIPATION AND

96
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,802
PRESIDENT’S PARTICIPATION AND COMMENTS ON NATO IS HIS PUSHING

97
00:03:30,846 --> 00:03:33,572
COMMENTS ON NATO IS HIS PUSHING THE IDEA OF NOT A 2%

98
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:35,474
THE IDEA OF NOT A 2% CONTRIBUTION OF DEFENSE SPENDING

99
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:38,477
CONTRIBUTION OF DEFENSE SPENDING BUT DOUBLING IT TO 4%. BASICALLY

100
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,379
BUT DOUBLING IT TO 4%. BASICALLY SIGNALING TO OUR NATO ALLIES

101
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:43,081
SIGNALING TO OUR NATO ALLIES THAT HE IS NOT GOING TO BE

102
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:44,115
THAT HE IS NOT GOING TO BE SATISFIED WITH ANYTHING THEY DO.

103
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,752
SATISFIED WITH ANYTHING THEY DO. IN FACT, HE DOESN’T WANT TO BE

104
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:48,353
IN FACT, HE DOESN’T WANT TO BE SATISFIED. HE WANTS A FIGHT WITH

105
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:50,088
SATISFIED. HE WANTS A FIGHT WITH NATO. THAT’S JUST WHERE HE’S

106
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:52,190
NATO. THAT’S JUST WHERE HE’S COMING FROM AND IT IS

107
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,792
COMING FROM AND IT IS DESTRUCTIVE TO OUR COLLECTIVE

108
00:03:53,802 --> 00:03:55,494
DESTRUCTIVE TO OUR COLLECTIVE SECURITY FOR ALL THE REASONS

109
00:03:55,504 --> 00:03:56,595
SECURITY FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT JACK REED POINTED OUT.

110
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:58,497
THAT JACK REED POINTED OUT. >> CONGRESSMAN, AFTER YOU SPENT

SO MUCH TIME STUDYING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN’S RELATIONSHIP AND

113
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:05,704
CAMPAIGN’S RELATIONSHIP AND INTERACTIONS WITH RUSSIA, WE SEE

114
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:07,806
INTERACTIONS WITH RUSSIA, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT ON HIS WAY TO A

115
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:09,608
THE PRESIDENT ON HIS WAY TO A MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN, A

116
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:11,009
MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN, A SUMMIT WITH HIM. WE ARE TOLD

117
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:12,978
SUMMIT WITH HIM. WE ARE TOLD THERE WILL BE A ONE-ON-ONE

118
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:15,113
THERE WILL BE A ONE-ON-ONE MEETING WHERE IT WILL SIMPLY BE

119
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:16,615
MEETING WHERE IT WILL SIMPLY BE PUTIN, TRUMP AND THE

120
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:17,416
PUTIN, TRUMP AND THE TRANSLATORS. DO YOU HAVE

121
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:18,617
TRANSLATORS. DO YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT?

122
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:20,519
CONCERNS ABOUT THAT? >> I CERTAINLY DO. AND I THINK

123
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,720
>> I CERTAINLY DO. AND I THINK THERE IS CLEARLY A REASON WHY

124
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:27,125
THERE IS CLEARLY A REASON WHY THEPUTIN. HE WANTS TO BE

125
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:28,761
THEPUTIN. HE WANTS TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE THAT MEETING AND

126
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:31,297
ABLE TO LEAVE THAT MEETING AND BE ABLE TO MAKE ANY CLAIM, NO

127
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:32,531
BE ABLE TO MAKE ANY CLAIM, NO MATTER HOW AT ODDS WITH THE

128
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:33,766
MATTER HOW AT ODDS WITH THE FACTS ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE,

129
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,134
FACTS ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE, KNOWING THAT PUTIN WILL NOT

130
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:36,635
KNOWING THAT PUTIN WILL NOT CHALLENGE HIM ON IT, KNOWING

131
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:39,738
CHALLENGE HIM ON IT, KNOWING THAT HE COULD REPRESENT WHATEVER

132
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:40,706
THAT HE COULD REPRESENT WHATEVER IS IN HIS INTERESTS EVEN THOUGH

133
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:42,341
IS IN HIS INTERESTS EVEN THOUGH HE ISN’T GOING TO BE WILLING TO

134
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:44,643
HE ISN’T GOING TO BE WILLING TO CONFRONT PUTIN ON OUR ELECTIONS,

135
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:47,246
CONFRONT PUTIN ON OUR ELECTIONS, HE’S NOT GOING TO BE WILLING TO

136
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:48,681
HE’S NOT GOING TO BE WILLING TO CONFRONT PUTIN ON RUSSIA’S

137
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:50,616
CONFRONT PUTIN ON RUSSIA’S INVASION OF ITS NEIGHBOR OR

138
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:52,318
INVASION OF ITS NEIGHBOR OR SUPPORT OF WAR CRIMINALS IN

139
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:53,352
SUPPORT OF WAR CRIMINALS IN SYRIA, BUT TRUMP CAN CLAIM

140
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:55,921
SYRIA, BUT TRUMP CAN CLAIM WHATEVER HE WANTS. THAT IS

141
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:57,423
WHATEVER HE WANTS. THAT IS CERTAINLY DANGEROUS, I THINK, TO

142
00:04:57,433 --> 00:04:59,558
CERTAINLY DANGEROUS, I THINK, TO OUR INTERESTS. WE DON’T KNOW

143
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:00,993
OUR INTERESTS. WE DON’T KNOW WHAT REPRESENTATIONS HE WILL

144
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:02,561
WHAT REPRESENTATIONS HE WILL MAKE TO PUTIN, WHAT UNDERSTANDS

145
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:04,329
MAKE TO PUTIN, WHAT UNDERSTANDS THEY ARRIVE AT. BUT IT IS VERY

146
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:07,366
THEY ARRIVE AT. BUT IT IS VERY MUCH IN RUSSIA’S INTEREST. I CAN

147
00:05:07,376 --> 00:05:09,569
MUCH IN RUSSIA’S INTEREST. I CAN ONLY SAY AND MUCH AS I

148
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:11,638
ONLY SAY AND MUCH AS I APPRECIATE THE KIND OF LUKEWARM

149
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:13,973
APPRECIATE THE KIND OF LUKEWARM GESTURE WE SAW OUT OF THE HOUSE

GESTURE WE SAW OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE ON NATO, REPUBLICANS

151
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:18,277

AUTHORITARIANISM RISING AROUND THE WORLD, THEY NEED TO WAKE UP.
