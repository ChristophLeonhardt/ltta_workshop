[LAUGHTER]

4
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:13,409
IT WAS THE MOVIE IT MADE FOR

5
00:00:13,409 --> 00:00:14,444
HIM, A FILM TO CAPTURE HIM.

6
00:00:14,444 --> 00:00:17,714
A FACE MELTING SALES TOOL FOR

7
00:00:17,714 --> 00:00:18,715
FREEDOM WHICH MR. TRUMP PLAYED

8
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:27,357
WITH THE NEW ULTRA NORTH KOREAN

9
00:00:27,357 --> 00:00:27,757

00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:29,159
STORY OF OPPORTUNITY, A NEW

12
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:30,026
STORY, A NEW BEGINNING.

13
00:00:30,026 --> 00:00:35,932
TWO MEN, TWO LEADERS, ONE

14
00:00:35,932 --> 00:00:36,266
DESTINY.

15
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:38,601
A STORY ABOUT A SPECIAL MOMENT

16
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:41,938
IN TIME WHEN A MAN IS PRESENTED

17
00:00:41,938 --> 00:00:45,475
WITH ONE CHANCE THAT MAY NEVER

18
00:00:45,475 --> 00:00:45,875
BE REFUTED.

19
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:46,342
WILL HE CHOOSE?

20
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:51,314
TO SHOW VISION AND LEADERSHIP OR

21
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:51,581
NOT.

22
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:55,051
A NEW WORLD TO BEGIN TODAY.

23
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:59,088
ONE OF FRIENDSHIP, RESPECT AND

24
00:00:59,088 --> 00:00:59,455
GOODWILL.

25
00:00:59,455 --> 00:01:02,926
BE A PART OF THAT WORLD WHERE

26
00:01:02,926 --> 00:01:03,927
THE DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY ARE

27
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:05,829
READY TO BE OPENED.

28
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:08,364
GREG: WHERE DO I SIGN UP?

29
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:11,401
HERE IS THE QUESTION -- WHY?

30
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:13,670
WHO WOULD DO THIS IT'S CRAZY.

31
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,207
IT'S NOT.

32
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:18,441
THE FILM SHOWS THE TYRANT WHAT

33
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:26,015
COULD BE IF HE STOPPED BEING A

34
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:33,156
[BLEEP].

35
00:01:33,156 --> 00:01:33,923
>> IT WAS A CHILD'S PRESENTATION

36
00:01:33,923 --> 00:01:35,158
TO ANOTHER CHILD TO CONVINCE HIM

37
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:36,059
TO COME TO THE PARTY.

38
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:36,960
>> THERE WERE REPORTERS IN THE

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,127
ROOM WHO THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE

40
00:01:38,127 --> 00:01:39,162
SOMETHING WITH THE NORTH KOREAN

41
00:01:39,162 --> 00:01:39,729
HAVE PUT TOGETHER.

42
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:40,763
>> IT WAS STRANGE AND I THINK

43
00:01:40,763 --> 00:01:41,764
THE POWER OF PROPAGANDA VIDEO

44
00:01:41,764 --> 00:01:44,934
LIKE THAT IS EXTREMELY OVERRATED

45
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:45,735
LIKE THAT IS EXTREMELY OVERRATE

46
00:01:45,735 --> 00:01:46,102
OVERRATED.

47
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:46,603
GREG: WHAT IDIOTS.

48
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:47,337
LOOK, IF YOU LIVE IN AMERICA

49
00:01:47,337 --> 00:01:51,641
WITH AN IPHONE, IPAD, THAT VIDEO

50
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:52,108
WASN'T FOR YOU.

51
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:54,410
IT WAS FOR THE NORTH KOREANS.

52
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,747
DO YOU JACKASSES LOOK AT A AFTER

53
00:01:57,747 --> 00:01:58,481
BABY FOOD AND SAY THAT

54
00:01:58,481 --> 00:01:59,782
COMMERCIAL IS SO STUPID I'M NOT

55
00:01:59,782 --> 00:02:05,755
A BABY?

56
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:06,990
WHAT IS THIS BUS STOP DOING FOR

57
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,357
MY HOUSE?

58
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:08,925
I DON'T NEED A BUS, I LIVE HERE.

59
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:15,698
LET ME SAY THIS SLOWLY.

60
00:02:15,698 --> 00:02:16,633
THE VIDEO IS NOT FOR YOU.

61
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:17,567
IT'S AN INTERVENTION MADE TO

62
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:21,905
PERSUADE TO SHOW OTHER OPTIONS

63
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:22,472
BESIDES ANNIHILATION.

64
00:02:22,472 --> 00:02:23,539
ISN'T THAT WHY YOU SHOWED IT TO

65
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:23,940
ME, DONALD?

66
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,308
THAT IS THE FUTURE.

67
00:02:25,308 --> 00:02:26,542
>> I SHOWED IT TO YOU BECAUSE

68
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:27,143
THAT IS A FUTURE.

69
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:30,947
THAT COULD VERY WELL BE THE

70
00:02:30,947 --> 00:02:36,819
FUTURE AND THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE

71
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:37,654
IS NOT A GOOD ALTERNATIVE.

72
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:38,554
GREG: YEAH, IT'S NOT VERY GOOD.

73
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:39,355
IT IS THIS OR DIE.

74
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:43,993
THAT'S NOT THE

75
00:02:43,993 --> 00:02:44,027
THAT'S NOT AHE

76
00:02:44,027 --> 00:02:44,460
THAT'S NOT APPEASEMENT BUT

77
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:44,894
SALESMANSHIP.

78
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:45,695
THAT IS TRUMPS TOOL AND HE GETS

79
00:02:45,695 --> 00:02:48,464
YOU INTO THE CAR.

80
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:49,565
ONCE THE DEALER GETS YOU TO

81
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:50,566
TESTDRIVE THE COURT THAT YOU

82
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:53,269
HAVE TWO OPTIONS.

83
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:54,304
NOT IN THE CORVETTE, IN THE

84
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:54,671
CORVETTE.

85
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:57,307
A LIFE OF SHINY FUN VERSUS A

86
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:58,141
PREVIOUS THAT STINKS UP TACO

87
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:02,011
BELL WRAPPERS.

90
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:14,457
THAT VIDEO LET KIM TESTDRIVE

91
00:03:14,457 --> 00:03:14,857
PROSPERITY.

92
00:03:14,857 --> 00:03:15,758
IT MAY FAIL BUT CRITICS, WHAT

93
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:16,693
YOU HAVE BESIDE MOCKERY?

94
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:17,860
YOU ARE MAD BECAUSE TRUMP DID IT

95
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,161
FIRST.

96
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,128
HE BEGAN WITH THE THREAT OF

97
00:03:19,128 --> 00:03:20,129
NUKES, ADDED SANCTIONS AND THEN

98
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:20,596
THE PERSUASION.

99
00:03:20,596 --> 00:03:28,438
HE SWUNG THE STICK AND THEN GAVE

100
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:28,838
THE CARROT.

101
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:29,405
IT IS SO ODD.

102
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:30,540
WASN'T THE LEFT A PIECE OF PARTY

103
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,908
IN THE RIGHT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE

104
00:03:31,908 --> 00:03:32,408
THE WAR PIGS.

105
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:33,309
OBAMA WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING

106
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:34,043
WORLD PEACE, NOT TRUMP.

107
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:35,244
MY GOD, NOW WE HAVE AN ORANGE

108
00:03:35,244 --> 00:03:35,578

[LAUGHTER]

110
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:36,813
NO WONDER THE LEFT IS A MESS.

111
00:03:36,813 --> 00:03:40,450
TRUMP STOLE THE LIBERAL PLAYBOOK

112
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,718
AND BEAT HIM OVER THE HEAD WITH

113
00:03:41,718 --> 00:03:41,985
IT.

114
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:43,152
YOU WOULD THINK THE LEFT WOULD

115
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:48,858
EMBRACES BUT NOT TRUMP IS BEHIND

116
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:49,125
IT.

117
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,226
THEN THEY TELL ALL OF US TO BE

118
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:50,593
SKEPTICAL.

119
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:51,561
THE LEFT IS THE LEAST SKEPTICAL

120
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:52,028
BUNCH ON EARTH.

121
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:53,062
THESE ARE THE SAME PIECE BLINDLY

122
00:03:53,062 --> 00:04:02,638
EMBRACE BOGUS CLIMATE

123
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:03,339

POSTMODERN DRIP ABOUT RACE OR

126
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:06,342
GENDER AND THE SAME PEOPLE WHO

127
00:04:06,342 --> 00:04:07,143
DEMAND SKEPTICISM WOULD APPLAUD

128
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:09,579
A SIX-YEAR-OLD MAN TO SELF

129
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:10,279
IDENTIFY AS A HAIRLESS CAT.

130
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:12,915
THAT WAS A SHOUT OUT TO BRIAN

131
00:04:12,915 --> 00:04:15,251
STELTER.

132
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:15,618
[APPLAUSE]

133
00:04:15,618 --> 00:04:27,964
A CHEAP SHOT.

134
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:28,931
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO STILL SAY

135
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:30,333
THE SUMMIT GAVE KIM A PHOTO OP,

136
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,168
THIS IS NORTH KOREA.

137
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:32,702
CREATE ONE.

138
00:04:32,702 --> 00:04:33,536
YOU THINK HE DOESN'T HAVE

139
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:37,240
PHOTOSHOP BACK IN HIS CASTLE?

140
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,307
IF THE SUMMIT IS A CONFESSION

141
00:04:38,307 --> 00:04:39,342
THEN YOUR SOLUTION ULTIMATELY IS

142
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:40,643
WAR BECAUSE THAT IS ALL YOU HAVE

143
00:04:40,643 --> 00:04:41,144
WITHOUT DIALOGUE.

144
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:42,211
I AM BEGINNING TO SOUND LIKE A

145
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:42,545

THE MEDIA COULD BE WRONG BUT AND

192
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:11,033
MAYBE THIS WHOLE THING IS ABOUT

193
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:11,567
SOMETHING ELSE.

194
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:13,569

THIRD COUNTRY WITH WHICH NORTH

196
00:06:16,706 --> 00:06:17,406
KOREA HAS A BORDER?

197
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:19,142
NORTH KOREA HAS A TINY LITTLE

198
00:06:19,142 --> 00:06:22,745
BORDER WITH A THIRD COUNTRY.

199
00:06:22,745 --> 00:06:23,880
IF YOU TAKE THAT BRIDGE AND THEY

200
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,148
LET YOU CROSS THE BORDER WHERE

201
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:30,286
YOU END UP IS RUSSIA.

202
00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:30,720
GREG: RUSSIA.

203
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:39,495
THAT IS THE TICKET.

204
00:06:39,495 --> 00:06:40,163
THAT IS ALWAYS THE TICKET.

205
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:40,830
NOT AVERTING NUCLEAR WAR.

206
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,130
CRAZY.

207
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:41,797
ANYWAY, I'M OPTIMISTIC AND

208
00:06:41,797 --> 00:06:42,198
HERE'S WHY.

209
00:06:42,198 --> 00:06:42,832

212
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:49,438
HILLARY, BEN RHODES, CARRIE.

213
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:50,573
OUR TEAM IS THE THREE MUSKETEERS

214
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:54,510

LONGER A NUCLEAR THREAT FROM

238
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:39,789

00:07:42,692 --> 00:07:43,593
WAS TELLING US OUR LIVES WERE IN

00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:43,926
DANGER?

246
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:44,694
IT GAVE ME A RUSH.

00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:48,130
DUDE.

249
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:48,931

BE AFRAID ANYMORE?

00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:36,399

342
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,133
IS INNOVATIVE BUT TYPICAL.

343
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:38,067

348
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:47,309
LOVED AMERICAN POP CULTURE AND

349
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:48,511
FIGURED OUT ALL THE THINGS THAT

350
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:49,912
HE LIKED AND SAID LET ME PUT

351
00:10:49,912 --> 00:10:53,783
THIS IN HERE TO CONVINCE HIM TO

352
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:54,350
BE A BETTER MAN.

353
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,684
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS THE

354
00:10:55,684 --> 00:10:56,952
FEAR THAT IN ANY WAY IT WAS

355
00:10:56,952 --> 00:10:57,420
ELEVATING HIM.

356
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,754
THIS IS A GUY WHO IS A MASS

357

360
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:04,493

362
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:07,096
WITH AMERICAN PRESIDENT BUT WITH

363
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:10,032
THAT BEING SAID I THINK THAT IT

364
00:11:10,032 --> 00:11:11,333
WAS VERY, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE

365
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,569

376
00:11:36,492 --> 00:11:37,193

00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:39,061
WHAT YOU THINK, CAT?

380
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:39,795
KAT: I WATCH THIS VIDEO WITHOUT

381
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:40,496
EVEN LOOKING AT MY PHONE ONE

382
00:11:40,496 --> 00:11:40,796
TIME.

383
00:11:40,796 --> 00:11:43,299
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE 2008

384
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:44,033
I THINK IT WAS AN INTERESTING

385
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:49,805
VIDEO WITH A BIZARRE VIDEO.

386
00:11:49,805 --> 00:11:50,606
I DON'T LIKE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE

387
00:11:50,606 --> 00:11:51,340
ROOTING AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP

388
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,909
BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WORKING

389
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:54,577
THINGS OUT WITH NORTH KOREA

390
00:11:54,577 --> 00:11:58,047
BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD HAVE TO BE

391
00:11:58,047 --> 00:12:01,116
WRONG.

392
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:01,784
THINGS ARE WORKING OUT WITH

393
00:12:01,784 --> 00:12:02,518
NORTH KOREA MEANS WAR A LOT OF

394
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:02,918
DEAD PEOPLE.

395
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:10,059
I DON'T LIKE TO BE WRONG BUT IF

396
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:10,726
MAYBE RIGHT MEANS A LOT OF

397
00:12:10,726 --> 00:12:11,360
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE I

398
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,094
ACTUALLY WOULD AIR ON THE SIDE

399
00:12:12,094 --> 00:12:20,536
OF ALLOWING PEOPLE TO LIVE.

400
00:12:20,536 --> 00:12:21,103
GREG: NICE OF YOU.

401
00:12:21,103 --> 00:12:21,871
KAT: APPARENTLY THAT IS A RARE

402
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:22,171
THING.

403
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:22,938
GREG: ESPECIALLY IN THE MEDIA I

404
00:12:22,938 --> 00:12:23,239
THINK.

405
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:23,906
TYRUS, DEPICTIONS ON THIS?

406
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:24,507
TYRUS: I LIKE THE BEST.

407
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:34,083
AND THAT WAS GREAT.

408
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,117
I WOULD PAY MONEY TO SEE -- NO,

409
00:12:35,117 --> 00:12:36,285
I'M JUST SAYING THAT I'M GLAD

410
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:37,152
BROTHERS WERE GETTING MORE WORK.

411
00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:37,653
WE ARE EVERYWHERE.

412
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:38,954
I'M ON FOX NEWS, WERE IN NORTH

413
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:39,855
KOREA.

414
00:12:39,855 --> 00:12:40,256
IT'S GREAT.

415
00:12:40,256 --> 00:12:40,623
[LAUGHTER]

416
00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:41,423
I LOOKED AT IT A DIFFERENT WAY.

417
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:44,994
IF YOU SHOW THAT VIDEO TO HIS

418
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:46,061
COUNTRY AND THEN KIM DOES NOT

419
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:46,495
COME THROUGH.

420
00:12:46,495 --> 00:12:56,171
HE WILL HAVE A PROBLEM.

421
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:56,705
GREG: THAT'S TRUE.

422
00:12:56,705 --> 00:12:57,473
TYRUS: THEY'VE DONE A VERY GOOD

423
00:12:57,473 --> 00:12:58,474
JOB OF KEEPING THEM SHELTERED

424
00:12:58,474 --> 00:12:59,508
AND SEALED IN THE ORIGINAL

425
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:00,476
VERSION OF THE VIDEO THEY SHOWED

426
00:13:00,476 --> 00:13:01,310
AMERICA WE WERE EATING THEIR

427
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:01,677
CHILDREN.

428
00:13:01,677 --> 00:13:02,211
GREG: THAT'S TRUE.

429
00:13:02,211 --> 00:13:02,778
TYRUS:

430
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:02,811
.YRUS:

431
00:13:02,811 --> 00:13:02,845
.TYUS:

432
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:02,878
.TYRU:

433
00:13:02,878 --> 00:13:04,513
.TYRUS: NOW THEY ARE LIKE THEY

434
00:13:04,513 --> 00:13:08,651
RIDE THEIR HORSES IN AMERICA?

435
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:11,253
[LAUGHTER]

436
00:13:11,253 --> 00:13:11,654
>> EXACTLY.

437
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:12,388
TYRUS: THE ONLY THING THAT WAS

438
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:14,790
MISSING WAS A VEGAS SHOT OR A

439
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:22,598
COUPLE MCDONALD'S BUT HE IS

440
00:13:22,598 --> 00:13:23,265
SHOWING THEM THE LIGHT.

441
00:13:23,265 --> 00:13:24,066
>> WHAT IS FUNNY IS DEMOCRATS

442
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:25,234
GET APPLAUDED FOR THE STUFF ALL

443
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:25,601
THE TIME.

444
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:26,635
WHEN THEY DO STUFF THAT THE

445
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:28,938
MEMBER WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS

446
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:40,282
RUNNING AND

447
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:49,892
IT WAS A SCENE FROM A MOVIE AND

448
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:51,060
IT WAS BUILT UP THEY GET

449
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,694
APPLAUDED FOR ALIGNING

450
00:13:51,694 --> 00:13:52,494
THEMSELVES WITH WHAT HOLLYWOOD

451
00:13:52,494 --> 00:13:53,495
BUT WHEN TRUMP DOES SOMETHING

452
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:54,163
THAT'S OUTSIDE THE BOX TO

453
00:13:54,163 --> 00:13:55,264
CONVINCE A TYRANT TO MAYBE FIND

454
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:56,465
A BETTER WAY HE GETS DEMONIZED

455
00:13:56,465 --> 00:13:56,799
FOR IT.

456
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,900
YOU HAVE TO PICK ONE FOR EITHER

457
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,435
IT'S A GOOD IDEA OR YOU HAVE TO

458
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:00,302
BE PICKING ON BOTH INDIVIDUALS

459
00:14:00,302 --> 00:14:00,803
WERE DOING IT.

460
00:14:00,803 --> 00:14:01,604
THE SELECTIVE OUTRAGE IS

461
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:02,071
HUMOROUS TO ME.

462
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:02,838
GREG: WALTER, DO YOU THINK THAT

463
00:14:02,838 --> 00:14:03,872
HE'S BEING TOO DEFERENTIAL OR IS

464
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:05,107
THIS AN OBVIOUS THAT WE ALL KNOW

465
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:05,708
WHAT HE'S DOING?

466
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,642
>> HE'S GOT SUCH A BIG EGO

467
00:14:06,642 --> 00:14:07,176
EVERYONE PRINTS IT.

468
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:08,177
HE GAVE THE SPOTLIGHT TO KIM.

469
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:08,577
GREG: TRUE.

470
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:13,782
WITH THAT SAID, SCOTT SAYS HE

471
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:14,683
USED HIS EGO AS A THERMOSTAT

472
00:14:14,683 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT HE TURNS UP AND DOWN.
