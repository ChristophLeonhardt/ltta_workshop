the main thing about Cuban cigars is the fact that it's kind of the forbidden fruit just because the cigars Cuban doesn't mean it's good and just because a cigar is not cumin doesn't mean it's bad we just got back from Cuba and we got a couple of boxes of cigars which were bought a couple of different ways first off we bought a box of Romeo y Julieta number ones at the hotel Havana Libre in their official Habanos sort of merchant outpost this was a hundred and ten dollars we got twenty-five cigars off the bat I'm looking at this and this looks absolutely real if you look at the quality of the box the watermark of the tax stamp you have a surgeon general's warning here you can look at the band look how beautiful and perfect it is this is a real Cuban cigar yeah it's ready to ready to smoke it's constructed very well this is a great cigar so then we bought this box in an apartment very black market for $100 okay off the bat you can tell that this is this is not a real box of Cubans they may be our Cuban and from Cuba but they're not the real deal if you look at the watermark that it has there's no hologram on it it's it's very cheap it also does not have the surgeon general's warning if you open it up and we take a look this is terrible it looks like some type of paper towel that was put here obviously a little bit wet to keep these cigars humidified which is a very bad way to do it now if we look at the actual cigars a thousand percent you could tell these are not authentic the bands are not uniform the cigars are not uniform you don't have a triple cap on the foot that's another thing usually Cubans have a flat foot just not a good cigar just not it's not a pleasant taste it's very low grade tobacco you need to go to a reputable tobacco dealer to make sure and look for those marks there are many different things that just even on the outside of the box before you open it and look at the cigars that will be a telltale sign of if you have an authentic product or not and you're not going to get a Cuban cigar for less than a certain price you get what you pay for that's what it comes down to
