beaucoup today the Stan Collymore show comes to beautiful Milan in Italy Italy will not be at the FIFA World Cup for the first time in a long long time but they'll be represented by a famous Italian company this is the 2018 version welcome to panini for Brit Co I'm delighted that you can join us here at panini headquarters in the center of Milan this is actually the first ever panini book give us a little bit of a history how panini started and how it got involved in making football stickers the panini family story is a typical Italian story of the 50s and 60s so after war the search or the noon live forget about the past they started their activity in the publishing area by means of buying a little kiosk in the centre of Modena and from there they've expanded the activity through the period between 1945 and 1962 first a distribution agency and then reworking the the so-called unsold copies of other publishers in into packets called surprise packets it was a success and that gave Josep a panini the eldest brother the idea to generate their first collection and that's where it all started hello my name's Stan lovely to meet you watch a let's have a look what you've got new school oh wow straight away the Three Lions yeah I like it give us an idea how difficult it is to formulate a squad so far out and how you keep managing to do it oh is working on the creation of the squads is the office of the sports editors hmm what is working the most normally is a crystal ball concentrate on this Cristobal and they they put all the information they have in it one of the information besides all the the work you normally do during the four years before the event the world still the iconic World Cup and of course it's in Mexico the Azteca Stadium so this really was a fantastic opportunity to to sell panini and the idea of collecting stickers around the world give us an idea of how successful that ended up becoming well is it to say this was the first album which was conceived to be international so with multilingual captions very simple captions about players just hard facts Bayers buyers and stance and was a big success it was it was and gave the panini brothers the confidence to carry on for the future at international level look at that well Cup 2018 for nearly stickers these are work without the idea we are 20 subject Mia okay and this is the base for mixing and after for baking so what happens next Simona next we are the mixing because we not mix together there all speakers she associated badge so there's the England's yeah three lions Poland Colombia can see they're got Pele that we interviewed on the stand Collymore show we've got the French team of 1998 Frank LeBoeuf doing this on the show how many stickers and this is and this is all they complete so we go every country every player Wow swapsies anybody hello bomb a broken please powder for random stickers at a time so you have a country and a player a different player different country different orders so that's where they're all mixed we have a pound week and we have 100 we close to the boxes here's one and this money I remember this one because this was a book for the PFA wasn't so it was strange because I remember that they turned up to the Liverpool training ground and may just just put on a PFA switch it was a terrible photo yeah and there's me with Robbie Fowler the pictures are so much better now in the proper panini stickers but there's me wait 13 starting 11 pounds first time a little bit heavier than that now 24 and Robbie Fowler and I scored a 102 goals between us for two seasons remember this like it was yesterday oh my goodness yes some of the stadium's still there now this was my favorite ever World Cup look at some of these players for Italy grazie Arne Boettiger Paolo Rossi Pietro Ferrero vaad Dino Zoff that played well into his forties for me the team that made me want to play football Junior Falcao serginho edy Zee Sergio Socrates and there's the man Alta and doing his Coimbra and I can remember filling these books in as if it was yesterday fantastic Simona thank you very much for the memories the memories of stickers yesteryear right the way up to the FIFA World Cup in Russia in 2018 as you can see we have the beautiful Kremlin and Red Square behind what Bosnia she's with me we're super excited Boz let's get straight into it first one France against Belgium the lowlands against the team that have won it before in 1998 both knocked out South American opposition what'd she take on France first well Fran started a tournament like real champions ooh they were lucky to get that result the win against Australia they've built themselves exploded against Argentina and did what they had to do against Uruguay they're looking very very good Belgium but must be feeling bulletproof you talked about knocking out South American countries they knocked out the favorites in Brazil so they must think that they can beat anyone big decision for Roberto Martinez but the Belgium manager who is he going to play got it technically right against Brazil does he stick with the same team or does he go a little bit different but for me I still think France had got the edge big decision for Deschamps as well in midfield does he bring back maturity or does he stick with ELISA two talented teams I think Fred's will take it out how important is this for the Premier League over the last two or three years everybody talks about Ronaldo Messi La Liga is the best this is a massive shot in the arm when you've got Paul Pogba so I'm for France when you've got Kevin de Bruyne ER and a lot of these Belgium players playing in the Premier League for the Premier League itself well course it is and the Premier League in my opinion is the most entertaining league in the world by far whoever and odds the best is very very difficult to judge but one thing I will say the depth I would say it goes deeper than any other league in the world and this is just showing that now the representatives you just mentioned the Tottenham player is playing for England and that as well and for France you've got the recent people like that it is great for any Li around the world to have players represented at the very highest level and especially at the biggest competition in the world give us your prediction for France against Belgium in the FIFA World Cup semi-final are in some petersburg tight game France to take it out probably after extra time right the second one we've both got a bit of skin in the game as they say I'm proud anglish Minh you are awesome proud you never guess him as he was yeah but wait for him Croatian heritage but both semifinals Croatia beating the host valiant effort by the Russian team but Luka Modric in Co got past it rocky teach and then England vanquishing black vanquishing Sweden tell me what you thoughts on on both of those quarterfinals well first and foremost Croatia look I just have to hold my hands up to Russia forget about it being a great World Cup as we've spoken about millions inside that team performed fantastically well we were both very concerned after last year's Confederations Cup as to what would have I would Russia go Russia in the first half were by far the better team totally deserve their lead crazy come back into it second half probably just edged it but then once again Russia fought back and got that equaliser right before the penalty shootout penalty shootouts no matter how much you bring it down to a fine science still comes down to a little bit of luck we had that luck like we had the game before against Denmark as well but little bit concerned two games 120 minutes and penalties a little bit concerned especially playing in Sochi which as you know is very very hot England I thought was a very convincing performance against Sweden I thought they should have put Colombia away before the last 10 minutes or so I thought Colombia will pour up until that point but then played really well and made you think why didn't they play like that throughout the whole game you think Croatia I do I do and one of the first times in my life I don't think I can lose because I spent over half my life in England Croatian heritage so it whichever way it goes it doesn't really matter but yes I do believe that England will beat Croatia and they'll play France in the final quite incredible to think I mean France against England is more of a famous rugby game than it is a football game but two countries separated by 22 miles of English Channel I love or LaMarche if you're French friendship that's Buzzy's prediction I want to ask you and pick your brains about goalkeeping there have been lots of penalty shootouts in this tournament the psychology of a taker Gareth Southgate we've both played with him he missed a big penalty in Euro 96 and he's had psychologists involved in the England set up he wants to own the process tell us what it's like for a goalkeeper is it much easier than a penalty taker and what goes through your mind when somebody's stepping up to take a big big penalty number one definitely much easier it's your opportunity as a goalkeeper to be a hero which comes few and far between for a goalkeeper your mentality when a player comes up to take a penalty difference from a shootout than it does from regular place if it's regular play you pretty much know who the penalty taker is gonna be okay it's gonna be staying calm I know where he likes to go but let's just sort of wait and see in a shootout it's a lot different well it was for me anyway it was like okay they're gonna be five so the ones who are gonna be taking two three four and five they're gonna be watching you so for those first couple I'm gonna stay still for as long as I possibly can and go the last minute if the people are going to take the other penalty see you moving they'll just say right he moves very quickly so basically I can put it in my way or I can change my mind lately he'll move if they wait and they see you watching what you want to do is to make sure that that head goes down of the penalty taker because once the head goes down then it's your time to go the non kicking foot is the important thing the vast majority of penalty takers that non-kicking foot points the way that the penalty is going to go excellent stuff boss as always great insights we're here in the last few days of the FIFA World Cup but it is the eve of the semi finals will it be France will it be Belgium will it be England or Croatia taking their place at the Luzhniki stadium Sunday hence for the FIFA World Cup final
