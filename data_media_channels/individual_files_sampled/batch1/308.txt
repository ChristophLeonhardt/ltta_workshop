Tommy Robinson has been jailed for 13 months for contempt of court he's often held up as a head of the farm hello and Richard gives burden you're at the listening post here are some of the stories were covering this week extremist voices and the media to give them a platform or not that is the question Ethiopia the new Prime Minister and the media so far so good but how real will the reforms prove to be a Bangladeshi photojournalist appears on al Jazeera speaks his mind and ends up behind bars I mean how ridiculous is that and the Saudi Twitter account that crashed and burned after evoking memories of 9/11 we begin with a question on the rise of far-right anti-immigration movements in countries like Great Britain do such movements and the support that they attract Drive media coverage or is it the other way around do the news media through excessive coverage help manufacture that support take Tommy Robinson who calls himself a warrior for freedom of speech on issues such as migration when he rails against the supposedly creeping influence of political Islam in UK society that resonates with audiences but what came first his newfound popularity or the coverage of him a recent academic study suggests that right-wing anti-immigration political parties such as the UK Independence Party you Kip owe more of their success to the news media than they would care to admit the news outlets do far more than just reflect current events this is a story about British politics but the issue at the core of it the relationship between the far-right and the news media is a dynamic at play in many countries around the globe our starting point this week is London Robinson leader of the ADL when it comes to figures like Tommy Robinson's PLAs Jim isn't just when to cover him or huh do you take any responsibility for that being a speaker you think I'm asking do you think the larger question is why when you scroll back to the beginning when Robinson had no tangible following did the British media cover him and provide him with a platform in the first place the intuitive idea that I think a lot of people have in their minds many journalists included is that if you see some sort of idea or actor that you find troubling let's say with respect to the public interest you want to go and report on that you want to say look this might be a problem the counterintuitive model which is I think the one that actually holds in reality is that it actually ends up being a feeding frenzy to say nothing to you these figures further and further into public support this is what right-wing extremism in the UK looks like 14 months ago a man plowed his van into a crowd near a mosque in London there were nine casualties and one fatality at the trial the court was told that the driver Darren Osborne wanted to kill Muslims was a follower of Tommy Robinson and had been in email contact with him just days before the attack British broadcasters saw nothing wrong with interviewing Robinson giving him airtime the day after the attack and again once the trial concluded Tommy Robinson has repeatedly being bailed out by the media Darren was born mode a bunch of pedestrians down for no other reason than that he assumed they were Muslims he did so inspired by Tony Robinson's ideology I would start with buying all Muslim I would temporarily halt Muslim immigration into this country was very day after the murder they put him on good morning Britain the day after down Osborne goes to jail they bring Tommy Robertson onto BBC Newsnight and give him the chance to represent himself as a martyr we had free terrorist attacks in quick succession and rather than talk about them as a radicalism factor for why this man required this known reactor when they put it on the fact that I'd report the truth every single time the media has given him a platform and made a politician out of somebody who was essentially a far-right football hooligan one of the most dangerous games that the the political and political liberals and the left have played over recent years has been to call for the banning of views they don't like because underlying all of this is the contemptuous underestimation of our fellow citizens who we assume are going to be easily duped easily turn into racists easily influenced I think that's a very dangerous contemptuous way of treating our fellow citizens lots of people talk about media coverage anecdotally impressionistic Lee but relatively few quantify it and analyze it an academic study published last week in the British Journal of political science examined more than a decade's worth of coverage by British newspapers of UK the UK Independence Party an anti-immigration party which fought for Britain's departure from the European Union the authors looked at the chicken and egg question of what came first was that UKIP's rise in popularity followed by increased coverage or did the press coverage of the party precede its surgeon support and have a causal effect we found that media coverage is a predictor of public support in future periods but we did not find any evidence that public support is a predictor of media coverage so there appears to be a unique causal effect between media coverage of these far-right wing populist parties and their rise in electoral significance I don't think that the media should be in the business of making moral decisions about what kind of voices are heard on the media I don't think the media is to blame for the rise of Thomas Robinson Tommy Robinson has opinions which should be heard argued over and discussed and that's not the same as saying that you endorsed those opinions depriving him of mainstream media coverage just means that he gains a certain mystique as though his ideas are so frightening that you have to keep them out of the mainstream the British media have been creating a space for whatever reason for the far right well in advance of any ostensible support for them and to justify it by saying ah but if we put them on television we'll expose them and what turns out to be the case is the journalists know very little about the history of the far-right about the history of the individuals they are arguing with about their politics or even about how to engage with or challenge their most defensive claims in the end they end up being played by the far-right one of the broadcaster's that interviewed Tommy Robinson over the Darren Osbourne case last year and has since given airtime to his supporters is the BBC this is how it explained its decision to provide them with a black flag there will be some politicians public figures or views featured in our news coverage that some of our audience will find unpalatable we wouldn't however censor a political viewpoint as we have a duty to create a platform whereas wider range of voices as possible can be heard we aim to analyse and scrutinize the facts so our audience can make up their own minds BBC wasn't the only British media outlet we approached with questions we also wrote to ITV and a radio station LBC neither chose to comment they've let their work speak for itself generally journalists are relatively inhospitable to extreme fringe far-right wing populist viewpoints but once those actors do force themselves onto the agenda then there's a feeding frenzy that occurs so that's how I think media and journalists specifically can produce a reality that they actually don't really want to see with the governing Conservatives divided over breakfast the opposition Labour Party split over the same issue and the mostly pro brexit tabloid press still pushing its agenda British politics is already in a messy state and when the broadcast media even with the best of journalistic intentions put the likes of Tommy Robinson on their air so that they can grill him they find they cannot do so without giving him the exposure he craves they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions that is where Britain seems to find itself today and the news media are just reporting the story many times they have a hand in driving it we're discussing other media stories that are on our radar this week with one of our producers Johanna who's Joe in Bangladesh a photojournalist has been arrested over comments that he made on this channel what specifically hasn't been charged with well the charges of giving false information now Bangladeshi police arrested Shahid Oh alum for that and for allegedly making provocative comments on al Jazeera during an interview about protests that have flared up across the country over how dangerous the roads are I saw the police going ganging up on students the law was charged under is the information and communications technology acts or ICT and this is a statute that media right groups say is often used to target journalists now alarm criticized the excessive use of force by police and protesters and set the demonstrations are motivated by factors larger than road safety alone among those factors he says the government's gagging of the media and corruption and alam isn't the only Bangladeshi journalist who's paid a price after covering these protests is he far from it supporters of the Awami League government and the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina have reportedly attacked more than a dozen reporters covering the protests beating them and damaging their equipment now as for the ICT at least 25 journalists and several hundred bloggers and Facebook users were prosecuted under the law last year alone over online content alleged to be defamatory or blasphemous now the government has promised to change that law but has yet to deliver moving on now to a story within a few months back Hungary and the ever tightening grip that the government there has on the media now one of the few remaining critical news outlets has had a change of editorial tune how did that happen exactly well Richard the outlet is hair TV which has now been bought out by jolt and Yaga's an ally of Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his ruling fee - party now here TVs former owner Leo Sami chica used to be close to the president as well but ever since relations turned sour three years ago he's become outspoken and critical which was reflected in hair TVs content now just hours after the takeover the channel's new owner shut down hairs leading news program and fired several senior employees various other journalists resigned in protest and I spoke with one of them Adam bihari a former reporter at the channel I mean you don't know when your media outlets gonna have a change of ownership or gonna have a change of voice or gonna have a change of structure editorial structure and new plans new values and you have your own values you're trying to stick to them but it's really really really hard to stick to your values and have a job actually in Hungary if you work in the media now now this transaction the sale of heel TV it's part of a larger trend isn't it media outlets that are critical suddenly ending up in the hands of or bonds supporters it is indeed and we've been tracking it in the past few years there have been a number of new media owners in Hungary orbán associates like Anne Davina Heinrich bachina and Lawrence majoras now here is what Bihari had to say about this a lot of televisions a lot of other outlets news portals journals have changed owners and all of these media outlets have been both either by really close friends of the Prime Minister himself or business people who have some kind of relationship with the governments so the map of the Hungarian media changes in a really dramatic way and in really fast way because it all happened in the last two years and that was Adam Bihari formerly of hair TV ok thanks Joe it was just six months ago after years of protests then a state of emergency that East Africa's most populous country Ethiopia saw an unexpected changing of the political guard the surprise resignation of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn led to a leader from the Oromo tribe a BA Achmed taking power in the four months since he became prime minister he has not only forged an historic agreement to end the 20-year standoff with Eritrea he's also made bold promises to end the authoritarianism of former Prime Minister's and to heal social tensions among Ethiopia's Oromo Amhara and Tigre ethnic groups the media specifically social media are central to this story because it was ethiopians constant use of platforms like Facebook and Twitter to coordinate protests and amplify grievances beyond the reach of government censorship that preceded all the changes the listening posts flow Philip's now on how social media both inside and outside the country shaped Ethiopia's political revolution and what some of the most influential Ethiopian journalists are now hoping for under their new prime minister on April 2nd a new prime minister an orally addressed Ethiopians as one nation hooligans democracies Lambada met the mountain he taken there was hope there was optimism you could take it as a sort of Obama's moment for Ethiopians is a very naive approach but the regime has 7m Achilles msr7 I met that I gave my touch recommend static method Lika Perugia bad weather allowing freedom of the press or to open up the space for for the opposition or even to restore peace with with Eritrea you gotta Toulon alumni to is a two-way da garage - I'm Alison ah ha got a tuna limited - Mel mathematician Lu the judgments are written in the cabinet Roland and I was very much impressed by his articulation his vision and how we would like to change things quite in a different way than we used to know des baux a guy who knew my chest Yemen Yemen a yak Mohammed hollow mangas he has buckle guy know prior to Prime Minister Abbey er meds rised power Ethiopia had had just two prime ministers in 23 years Mallinson are we who spent his 17 years consolidating power around his ethnic group that agreeance and Haile Mariam dessaline II whose leadership only preserved the status quo ignoring widespread calls for reforms during that period Ethiopia's democracy was stained with sham elections and clamp downs of media criticism draconian legislation such as the 2004 Criminal Code and the 2009 anti-terror proclamation was repeatedly abused landing thousands of journalists and political activists in prison and sending countless others into exile I've been in prison nine times for over nine years and for what for it simply writing my views not nothing more this the final time I was in prison for six and a half years I was charged as a terrorist of course I've never been a terrorist this is what you get for working as a journalist and tourism and dictatorships critical media was you know being decimated one way or another and journalists were leaving the country we saw that kind of yawning up in the media and of course the 2009 media no in itself put a lot of restrictions on media registration and access to funding to the media and all these things that really systematically eliminated independent media of the ground despite the Ethiopian authorities tight control of the mainstream media and the internet social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter broke the government's hold on information increased access to smartphones and improvements in Internet connectivity led tech savvy Ethiopians to use social media to talk politics by 2015 massive demonstrations against government land grabbing in the Oromia region had broken out social media proved crucial for the coordination of protests and the airing of grievances JAMA Mohammed an activist and journalist from our Amir became a key player from his base in the United States beyond the reach of the Ethiopian authorities four years ago he turned his living room in Minnesota into a kind of newsroom posting and tweeting eyewitness accounts of government abuse for his millions of followers back home sharing protest tactics and strategies and using his platforms to help Ethiopians collect you cannot imagine this revolution this change without social media people from all corners of the world will snap a picture record the video and send it to us who was support through Facebook and we take that we verified we edited and we Arab button and they take our production in the ferry tour Mahmoud was the one central figure that played a very decisive role in galvanizing the protest he has become a virtual space for the gathering of the message of the protesters who have been silenced it who have been killed who could not trust the media to tell their stories they trust Joe they sent their stories to him and he broadcasts it back and you can disagree with him I have a lot of things that I disagree with him but you can't deny him that significant role he played in this in this protest he was involved in mobilizing people you know to come out and and ask and demand their their freedom in when there's absence of democracy journalists are forced to double as activists for democracy and that's what drama does that he wasn't fighting for a specific political life he was advocating for fundamental democratic rights because unless there's fundamental democratic democratic rights there's no journalism the kind of fast change that we've seen over the last three years without the Media would have been impossible and the mainstream media and this you know it hurts my ego to admit that we were back burners in this whole process we were blade cameras and hoods it has taken us too long to understand this shift and the ability to use the social media to affect the kind of change that the political activists have done quite successfully Ethiopian journalists working in the Diaspora like Jawa Mohammed have spent the last few years supporting movements for political change from afar now with a new prime minister it's time to assess whether a Bey Ahmed will follow through on his promise to open up the space for free expression and for them to work out their own journalistic role in this new Ethiopia emerge she de is the Minister for communication affairs we asked him about the government's plans to review the restrictive media legislation still in place we have already set up a legal professionals Council to review different laws that prohibits or that limits citizens exercise of their political right whether it is in the media context or in the political party context and definitely it's going to be addressed this is part of the deepening of democratization and of reforms that has been articulated and managed and led by the prime minister and Ethiopians are already seeing the results since the beginning of this year more than 6,000 political prisoners many of them journalists like a skinned Onaga have been released and on June 22nd a buyers chief of staff tweeted the 264 websites and TV channels including critical media outlets like Java muhammad's or a mere media network had been unblocked there are still significant roadblocks to a genuinely free press including repressive laws that remain on the books but the government's call for journalists to help restructure Ethiopia's media landscape is being taken up some of them are coming home the kind of freedom that we see anything appear today is unprecedented but everybody has this doubt in their mind is this is this a dream as I going to last is this guy going to go to another dictator I will be traveling back to the country to build the media we have now established our headquarters our office in an Sabha where were 20 not supporting but we are going to hold his feet to the fire as well because there are a lot of promises it must kill does not deliver the promise of democracy then we'll be back to social media we'll go back to advocating for democracy for transparency for equality and we'll end up clashing with the government if so I'm prepared to go back to prison again so whether there's democracy or no democracy it's back to work there's no choice and finally a diplomatic spat involving Canada and Saudi Arabia this past week unfolded over Twitter and featured an account called infographic KSA KSA as in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia the account was quote managed by a group of Saudi youth interested in technology and social media when Canada's foreign minister expressed grave concern over the kingdom's jailing of civil society activists Saudi Arabia instantly expelled the Canadian ambassador suspended trade relations and a graphic appeared on that Twitter account showing an airliner heading towards Toronto's CN Tower it was all very 9/11 the image was quickly pulled down an apology was tweeted and Saudi officials ordered the account closed but the damage was done the bad taste noted the Saudis are currently engaged in information battles on many fronts and infographic KSA had been part of that effort ever since 2015 weighing in on Saudi conflicts with Iran and Qatar among other issues we leave you now with some of the graphics posted on the newly defunct account and we'll see you next time here at The Listening Post
