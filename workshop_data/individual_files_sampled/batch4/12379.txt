so now the Clintons are back in the news because history doesn't look kindly on those people who stand for nothing and the other problem by the way with people who stand for nothing is they can really become radicalized Hillary more than her husband had leftist convictions she wrote her whole college thesis on Saul Alinsky on rules for radicals she'd loved the guys who write to him all the time and the trouble is when the spirit of the age moves far left moves in a radical direction they are there they become radicals and Hillary more than her husband tried to push the spirit of the age in that direction as well so now they're going on this big stadium tour to do I don't know to do a two-man show to do a little vaudeville act probably a bad idea though during the me2 age because do you outlook I don't know if you're a history buffs or not but Bill Clinton had a few accusations thrown against him and they were much more credible than Brett Kavanaugh so Christiane Amanpour to her credit she's a terrible journalist but to her credit she asks Hillary Clinton what about the allegations against your husband here's what she has to say you're gonna be prepared to have questions about that moment in 1998 the impeachment the allegations of sexual harassment against your own husband are you prepared to answer those questions is he prepared to answer them and how do you see that similar or different from what President Trump is being accused of and Cavanagh and others today well there's a very significant difference and that is the intense long-lasting partisan investigation that was conducted in the 90s if you know the Republicans starting with President Trump on down want a comparison they should welcome such an investigation themselves excuse me what we you were asked about the allegations you were asked about the elegant she says oh it's the difference is that darn monster Ken Starr that's the difference the vast right-wing conspiracy so well maybe you could talk about the allegations first also if you want an investigation Brett Kavanaugh just testified more than all other Supreme Court nominees combined and he he also had his seventh FBI so even that doesn't make any sense but just look at that she learns nothing first of all she doesn't believe anything that's why for her it always just goes back to this investigation and they wronged me and me me me me me but she she was singing this exact same tune in the 1990s here is Hillary Clinton could have been yesterday though it was actually 20 years ago talking to Matt Lauer on The Today Show about the allegations against her husband First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton candidly answered questions with NBC's Matt Lauer on The Today Show this morning she wasted no time and slamming special prosecutor Kenneth Starr accusing him of being behind the allegations that have rocked the presidency we get a politically motivated prosecutor who is allied with the right-wing opponents of my husband who has literally spent four years looking at every telephone a million dollars and more than that now but looking at every telephone call we've made every check we've ever written scratching for dirt intimidating witnesses doing everything possible to try to make some accusation against my husband if he were to be asked today mrs. Clinton do you think he would admit that he again has caused pain in this marriage no absolutely not and he shouldn't the great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president that's that's the story the vast right-wing conspiracy that was her phrase by the way I had to change the clip there at the end talk about conspiracies when you watch that first clip on YouTube the audio cuts out when you get to the money line when you get to the vast right-wing conspiracy I don't know there might be a vast left-wing conspiracy there but that's what she said it's all about the vast right-wing conspiracy forget the allegations she was singing that same tune then she doesn't learn anything she doesn't learn that you can't call half the country deplorable and irredeemable she's still doing it two years later she doesn't learn any of these things she's unable to see the hypocrisy two of the investigations you heard there you know Matt Lauer chiming and Owen spends 30 million dollars all it's been so ah and now I wonder what Hillary Clinton thinks about the Muller investigation into Trump I wonder what she thinks about special counsels
