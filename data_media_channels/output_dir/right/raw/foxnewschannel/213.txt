1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:04,694
I'M ROBERT GRAY, NOW BACK TO.

2
00:00:04,695 --> 00:00:05,195
"WATTERS' WORLD."

3
00:00:05,196 --> 00:00:08,598
JESSE: THE RNC HITTING BACK AT

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:11,601
THE VIOLENT LEFT AFTER A WEEK OF

5
00:00:11,602 --> 00:00:14,838
RAGING PROTESTS AGAINST JUSTICE

6
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,007
BRETT KAVANAUGH.

7
00:00:17,008 --> 00:00:22,946
NEW ANTIFA ATTACKS IN PORTLAND.

8
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:24,914
>> WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE KICK.

9
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:27,584
>> IF YOU SEE ANYBODY IN A

10
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:30,320
RESTAURANT, IN A DEPARTMENT

11
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,122
STORE, AT A GASOLINE STATION,

12
00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:34,891
YOU GET UP AND YOU CREATE A

13
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:35,392
CROWD.

14
00:00:35,393 --> 00:00:37,327
AND YOU PUSH BACK ON THEM, AND

15
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:44,434
YOU TELL THEM, THEY ARE NOT

16
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:45,235
WELCOME.

17
00:00:45,236 --> 00:00:48,772
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THERE

18
00:00:48,773 --> 00:00:50,907
AREN'T UPRISING ALL OVER THE

19
00:00:50,908 --> 00:00:51,241
COUNTRY.

20
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:56,313
MAYBE THERE WILL BE.

21
00:00:56,314 --> 00:00:59,082
>> YOU CANNOT BE CIVIL WITH A

22
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,117
POLITICAL PARTY THAT WANTS TO

23
00:01:01,118 --> 00:01:03,153
DESTROY WHAT YOU STAND FOR, WHAT

24
00:01:03,154 --> 00:01:05,021
YOU CARE ABOUT.

25
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:07,657
>> GET UP AND PLEASE, GET UP IN

26
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:10,560
THE FACE OF SOME CONGRESS

27
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:10,894
PEOPLE.

28
00:01:10,895 --> 00:01:13,630
JESSE: TUCKER CARLSON IS HERE.

29
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:17,000
HE'S THE HOST OF "TUCKER

30
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:20,337
CARLSON" AND AUTHOR OF "SHIP OF

31
00:01:20,338 --> 00:01:23,039
FOOLS" WHICH IS SITTING FIRST ON

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,741
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" BEST SELLER

33
00:01:24,742 --> 00:01:25,041
LIST.

34
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:27,410
WITHOUT THE POWER OF THE STATE,

35
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:30,146
LIBERALS DON'T HAVE THE HOUSE,

36
00:01:30,147 --> 00:01:31,681
THE SENATE OTHER WHITE HOUSE.

37
00:01:31,682 --> 00:01:34,284
SO THERE IS NO WAY FOR THEM TO

38
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:35,452
DEPLOY LIBERALISM.

39
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:37,153
SO THEY ARE FORCED TO GO TO THE

40
00:01:37,154 --> 00:01:39,689
STREETS AND BULLY AND INTIMIDATE

41
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,023
PEOPLE.

42
00:01:40,024 --> 00:01:41,424
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS

43
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:41,758
TACTIC.

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,560
>> I THINK THAT IS TRUE.

45
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,829
I THINK THEY HAVE THE POWER OF

46
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,731
THE H.R. DEPARTMENT IN MOST OF

47
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:48,131
COMPANIES.

48
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:50,567
I THINK THEY HAVE THE POWER OF

49
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,002
THE TECH MONOPOLIES WHICH

50
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:54,771
CONTROL ALL HUMAN INFORMATION.

51
00:01:54,772 --> 00:01:57,407
BUT THE PURPOSE OF THESE MOBS IS

52
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,809
TO AFFECT THE POLITICAL END.

53
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,212
IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY ARE MAD,

54
00:02:02,213 --> 00:02:04,047
THOSE KIDS ARE PROBABLY MAD.

55
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:05,949
THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD TO BE MAD SO

56
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,984
THEY CAN REACH AN OBJECTIVE

57
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:11,121
WHICH IS GETTING DEMOCRATS

58
00:02:11,122 --> 00:02:13,223
ELECTED TO POSITIONS OF POWER.

59
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:15,759
JESSE: IT'S ALL ABOUT

60
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,159
PERSUASION.

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,128
THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO

62
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:20,163
ARTICULATE AN IDEA AND CONVINCE

63
00:02:20,164 --> 00:02:21,731
VOTERS TO CHOOSE THAT IDEA.

64
00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:24,701
THEY ARE TOLD TO SCREAM AND

65
00:02:24,702 --> 00:02:26,903
HARASS THEIR POLITICAL ENEMIES

66
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:30,373
AND MAKE THEM COWER IN FEAR.

67
00:02:30,374 --> 00:02:32,375
>> LIBERALS, DEMOCRATS, IF THEY

68
00:02:32,376 --> 00:02:36,479
WANTED TO MAKE A CASE FOR MIDDLE

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,581
CLASS ECONOMICS THEY WOULD

70
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:39,382
PROBABLY JUST WIN.

71
00:02:39,383 --> 00:02:41,518
JESSE: DON'T SAY THAT.

72
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,820
THERE COULD BE LIBERALS

73
00:02:43,821 --> 00:02:44,187
WATCHING.

74
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:46,756
TRUMP WINS OUT OF NOWHERE, WHY

75
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:52,061
NOT STEAL HIS IDEAS AND MAKE

76
00:02:52,062 --> 00:02:52,996
THEM YOUR OWN.

77
00:02:52,997 --> 00:02:55,765
JESSE: THEY NEVER DID A REAL

78
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:59,869
ASSESSMENT OF WHY THEY LOST IN

79
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,170
2016.

80
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:01,671
THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE WORKING

81
00:03:01,672 --> 00:03:04,007
CLASS MEN AND WOMEN IN THIS

82
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:05,642
COUNTRY AND DOUBLED DOWN ON

83
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,709
IDENTITY POLITICS.

84
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,479
THEY COULD BE TALKING ABOUT

85
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,815
HEALTHCARE AND COLLEGE TUITION.

86
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,416
NOW THEY ARE DWELLING ON

87
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:15,118
KAVANAUGH WHICH IS A LOSING

88
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,820
ISSUE FOR THEM.

89
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,255
>> THE IDEA THE CALF ENOUGH

90
00:03:19,256 --> 00:03:23,993
DEBATE WAS ABOUT RACE.

91
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:26,563
THAT'S CRAZY TALK.

92
00:03:26,564 --> 00:03:29,065
IT'S THE CUL-DE-SAC OF IDENTITY

93
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:29,432
POLITICS.

94
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:32,135
MAYBE YOU GET TO WIN A MID-TERM

95
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:34,137
ELECTION ON THAT, BUT YOU

96
00:03:34,138 --> 00:03:36,005
DESTROY THE COUNTRY YOU ARE

97
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:38,541
GOVERNING IN THE END.

98
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:40,410
EVEN DEMOCRATS ARE LIKE I DON'T

99
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:41,945
KNOW, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

100
00:03:41,946 --> 00:03:43,847
MOST OF PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF

101
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:44,681
THAT KIND OF STUFF.

102
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,217
>> THE DEMOCRATS VERY AFRAID OF

103
00:03:47,218 --> 00:03:49,252
KANYE WEST AND HIS RELATIONSHIP

104
00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:51,120
WITH DONALD TRUMP.

105
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:53,656
HERE IS KANYE SPREADING SOME

106
00:03:53,657 --> 00:03:56,226
LOVE TO THE PRESIDENT IN THE

107
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:56,526
OVAL.

108
00:03:56,527 --> 00:04:00,396
>> I LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

109
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:06,135
I LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

110
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:08,071
PRESIDENT TRUMP: THAT'S FROM THE

111
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:08,371
HEART.

112
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:12,108
JESSE: THE MEDIA REACTION

113
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:12,942
APOPLECTIC.

114
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:14,577
>> WOW!

115
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:15,912
I AM DOING THIS FOR EVERYBODY

116
00:04:15,913 --> 00:04:17,347
WHO IS WATCHING.

117
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:19,082
TURN YOUR VOLUME DOWN.

118
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,684
NOW YOU CAN PUT IT UP AGAIN.

119
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:23,353
THAT WAS BONKERS.

120
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:25,922
>> IF YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING

121
00:04:25,923 --> 00:04:29,092
TO GET A THOUGHTFUL PLAY BY PLAY

122
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:30,960
AND POLITICAL ANALYSIS YOU

123
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:31,294
AREN'T.

124
00:04:31,295 --> 00:04:34,597
>> THAT WAS A SHINY OBJECT IN

125
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:37,467
THE OVAL OFFICE WEARING A RED

126
00:04:37,468 --> 00:04:38,568
HAT.

127
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,336
HE WAS IN FRONT OF MOSTLY WHITE

128
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:42,472
PEOPLE EMBARRASSING HIMSELF AND

129
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:44,541
EMBARRASSING AMERICANS, BUT

130
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:46,109
MOSTLY AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

131
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,611
KANYE'S MOTHER IS ROLLING OVER

132
00:04:48,612 --> 00:04:49,245
IN HER GRAVE.

133
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:53,016
>> A BLACK MOUTH IS MOVING BUT

134
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:54,851
WHITE RACIST IDEALS ARE FLOWING

135
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:58,688
FROM KANYE WEST'S MOUTH.

136
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:01,057
JESSE: I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

137
00:05:01,058 --> 00:05:02,659
>> I DO.

138
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,460
THE LAST GUY CALLING RACISM

139
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:06,930
LIVES IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

140
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:11,568
A RICH, WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD.

141
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:13,336
JESSE: THAT'S MICHAEL ERIC

142
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:14,070
DYSON.

143
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:14,837
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

144
00:05:14,838 --> 00:05:16,272
THIS IS WHAT THEY THINK THEY

145
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:18,808
HAVE TO SAY TO MAKE SURE NONE OF

146
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:22,812
US TAKE WHAT KANYE WEST SAID

147
00:05:22,813 --> 00:05:23,179
SERIOUSLY.

148
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,316
HE SEEMS PRETTY ECCENTRIC TO ME,

149
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:28,351
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S NOT

150
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:29,586
TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT A COUPLE

151
00:05:29,587 --> 00:05:31,120
OF THINGS.

152
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:33,489
IF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS SO

153
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,159
GREAT FOR BLACK PEOPLE, WHY IS

154
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,395
CHICAGO AND THE DETROIT AREA IN

155
00:05:39,396 --> 00:05:41,097
SUCH DISARRAY.

156
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:43,766
IF THEY THINK HE'S CRAZY, WHY

157
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:45,034
ARE THEY ATTACKING HIM.

158
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:49,439
IF YOU ATTACKED A CRAZY HOMELESS

159
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,940
PERSON ON THE BUS YOU WOULD BE A

160
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:51,908
BAD PERSON.

161
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:56,713
THESE ARE AUTHORITARIAN TACTICS

162
00:05:56,714 --> 00:05:57,747
AGAINST THE GUY.

163
00:05:57,748 --> 00:06:00,817
JESSE: WHEN HE'S SAYING GEORGE

164
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,886
BUSH DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BLACK

165
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:04,754
PEOPLE, THEY ARE NODDING THEIR

166
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:05,355
HEADS.

167
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:07,590
BUT THEN HE SAYS MAKE AMERICA

168
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:09,325
GREAT AGAIN, THEY ARE SHAKING

169
00:06:09,326 --> 00:06:11,628
THEIR HEADS AND CALLING HIM

170
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:11,928
CRAZY.

171
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:14,664
JESSE:Y WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

172
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,667
WHERE IS DR. FORD, WHERE IS

173
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,203
STORMY DANIELS?

174
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:24,474
WHERE IS STORMY DANIELS AND HER

175
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:24,807
CASE?

176
00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:27,043
THESE THREE PEOPLE WERE GOING

177
00:06:27,044 --> 00:06:29,479
TO -- THESE WERE ICONS.

178
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,748
AND THE MEDIA GAVE THEM THE BIG

179
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:34,117
HUG AND WAS PROTECTING THEM AND

180
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:36,085
SHOWCASING THEM, AND THEY HAVE

181
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:36,586
BEEN DROPPED.

182
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:39,022
>> THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE.

183
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,392
WHERE IS RICHARD JEWEL WHO WAS

184
00:06:42,393 --> 00:06:45,428
BLAMED FOR THE ATLANTA BOMBING.

185
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:48,464
WHAT HAPPENED TO GARY CONDITT

186
00:06:48,465 --> 00:06:52,402
WHO WAS ACCUSED OF MURDER.

187
00:06:52,403 --> 00:06:54,737
>> WE USE PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA TO

188
00:06:54,738 --> 00:06:56,105
MAKE OUR POINT.

189
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:59,242
