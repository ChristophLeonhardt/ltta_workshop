>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IN CLEVELAND
YESTERDAY AHEAD OF TUESDAY'S
PRIMARIES WHICH HAVE FORMER U.S.
CONGRESSMAN DENNIS KUCINICH HEAD
TO HEAD WITH ELIZABETH WARN FOR
THE GUBERNATORIAL NOMINATION.
THIS AS CORDUROY ATTACKS HIS 0
OPPONENT'S FOX NEWS APPEARANCES
MPLE HE KNOWS THE GAME HE'S
PLAYING.
HE'S BROUGHT ON SO THEY CAN SAY
HE'S FAIR AND BALANCED.
HE'S THEIR HOUSE POODLE.
HE PLAYED THE GAME, TOOK THEIR
MONEY, MADE HIS CHOICES.
>> HERE TO REACT, 2008
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE DENNIS CUE
CANDIDATE DENNIS KUE
CANDIDATE DENNIS KUCINICH.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE THIS
MORNING.
YOUR REACTION TO THE ATTACK AD
THAT YOU ARE FOX NEWS' HOUSE
POODLE.
>> LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY THAT
MR. CORDRAY WAS THE WATCHDOG AT
THE CONSUMER PROTECTION BOARD
BUT THE CATCH DOG WALKED AWAY
FROM HIS POST AND COST MILLIONS
DOLLARS.
I THINK IF HE'S GOING TO STAY
MAKING CANINE COMPARISONS, WE
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FACT THAT
WHEN HE LEFT HIS POST, HE TURNED
THE KEYS OF THE FINANCE
PROTECTION BUREAU OVER TO THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.
SO YOU KNOW, I THINK HE HAS SOME
ACCOUNTING TO DO ON THAT.
>> ALL RIGHT.
SO RICHARD CORDRAY BACKED BY
ELIZABETH WARREN.
THE PRIMARY IS THIS COMING
TUESDAY, A STATE THAT PEOPLE ARE
WATCHING CLOSELY.
THE PRESIDENT THERE YESTERDAY
TOUTING TAX REFORM.
WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF WHERE THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS IN THE STATE
OF OHIO.
YOU LOOK AT CORDRAY CLEARLY WITH
LIBERAL POLICIES
POLICY
POOLICY
POLIICY
POLICIY
POLICIES.WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GI
POLICIES.WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GG
POLICIES.WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GT
POLICIES.WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GO
HAPPEN ON TUESDAY?
>> ELIZABETH WARREN IS OPPOSED
TO ASSAULT WEAPONS IN HER STATE
OF MASSACHUSETTS BUT APPARENTLY
IS FOR THEM IN THE STATE OF OHIO
BECAUSE MR. CORDRAY IS FULL ON
WITH THE NRA ON THAT.
IT'S A CONTRADICTION THERE.
BUT AS FAR AS THE OTHER ISSUES,
DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
GIVE THE PEOPLE A REAL CHOICE,
WHETHER IT'S UNEMPLOYMENT OR
FULL EMPLOYMENT ECONOMY OR
RISING STUDENT DEBT OR FREE
COLLEGE, FOR-PROFIT HEALTH CARE,
NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH CARE.
ASSAULT WEAPONS OR A BAN ON
ASSAULT WEAPONS.
I'M TRYING TO HELP THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY DEFINE ITSELF
SO IT CAN WIN IN NOVEMBER.
IF NOT, IT'S GOING TO BE THE
SAME OLD SAME OLD.
WE HAVE TO OFFER THE AMERICANS A
REAL CHOICE.
>> THERE'S A DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER
WARNING THAT THE BLUE WAVE HAS
STALLED.
HE SAYS DEMOCRATIC MOMENTUM HAS
STALLED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS.
DEMOCRATS HAVE APPEARED LESS
FOCUSED ON THE ISSUES THAT
ENGAGE THE PRESIDENT TRUMP
VOTER, AT THE SAME TIME, WHITE
WORKING CLASS MEN COULD POINT TO
A CONSERVATIVE POLICY
ACHIEVEMENT.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT
STATEMENT COMING FROM A
DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER BEING
CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS
LOOZEING THEIR MOMENTUM.
THEY'RE NO FOCUSED ON THE ISSUES
THAT AMERICANS ARE FOCUSED
ABOUT.
>> IT'S NOT JUST WHITE FOLK THAT
ARE CONCERNED.
WE HAVE TO TURN OUT WORKING
PEOPLE, WHATEVER THEIR COLOR AND
TO RESPOND TO THEIR PRACTICAL
ASPIRATIONS FOR GOOD PAYING
JOBS, FOR NOT JUST BETTER WAGES
BUT FOR BENEFITS.
YOU KNOW, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
LOST TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE YEARS
AGO WHEN IT WENT WITH THESE
TRADE DEALS THAT TOOK JOBS OUT
OF OUR COUNTRY, WHEN THEY
CONTINUED TO FUND THE WARS, WHEN
THEY BAILED OUT THE BANKS ON
WALL STREET.
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR THE REAL
DEMOCRATS TO SHOW UP.
AND I'M A REAL DEMOCRAT.
THE DEMOCRATIC ACCOMPLISHMENT
WANTS TO WIN CONTROL FOR
THEMSELVES, NOT FOR THE PEOPLE.
AND BOTH PARTY ESTABLISHMENTS
ARE LOCKED INTO YESTERDAY.
SO YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT
THERE'S ANOTHER SHAKEUP COMING
IN 2018 IN BOTH PARTY
ESTABLISHMENTS BETTER WATCH OUT.
>> WE WILL SEE.
