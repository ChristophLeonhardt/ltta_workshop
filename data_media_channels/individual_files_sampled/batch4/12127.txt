with me now host of the michael Nolls show on The Daily wire Michel Noel's Michael good to see you Liz good to see you alright Michael this article from Tennessee coats in the Atlantic I mean you saw the picture in the introduction essentially having Kanye West in white face half of his face was showered in this basically whitewash the rest of him was black this article proves Kanye's point that they are telling him they are defining the left wants to define who he is as a black person and if he does not toe their ideological line they will demean him and tell him that he is not who he says he is that's right this comes from Tom ez Coates who is every white liberals favorite magazine writer you see similar accusations coming in from Donald Glover childish gambino who did that video this is America and what we're seeing here in Tana hazy coats's argument is it opens up and it says I'm not black I'm Kanye which is a play on a Jason's line so to begin doneghy Coates compares Kanye to a double murderer wife beater then he compares him to Michael Jackson a child molesting drug addict and later accuses Jackson and Kanye of trying to destroy black bodies of trying to destroy blackness what we're seeing here is the play toward white liberals I think this is the new form of minstrel see in the old days the minstrel shows were played for white Democrats and they portrayed black people as inept and unable to help themselves and unable to better their situation and what writers like Tommy Z Coates do on the pages of the Atlantic and what singers like Donald Glover and childish gambino do in the popular culture are precisely the same thing the minute that a black American has the audacity the temerity to say I'm willing to think for myself this country has allowed me to make something of myself to advance economically you can't keep me down there's nothing there's no boot on my head keeping me down if I want I can make something of my life the minute a black man has the audacity to do that they smear him they tar him they say he's in authentically black they've done this to Thomas soul they've done it to Candis Owens they did it to Clarence Thomas now they're doing it to Kanye West it's pathetic it's a new form of minstrel show and the people who do it like Tanya hazy coats should be ashamed right I mean it's the same as one racist put on blackface show this is white face this should not be acceptable no matter what your political affiliation is Michael it really boils down to the fact that liberals think that people should vote based only on the color of their skin that's it furthermore they demagogue it they say that if you are black that means you should vote for Democrats and I think if you are any color you should never even consider voting for Democrats I wrote a whole book on this actually called reasons to vote for Democrats you can read it in about 20 seconds but what they demagogue this and they say that if you are born a certain color you would be a traitor to your race you would be if you have the audacity to think for yourself you're a traitor and what the Republican Party has always offered is freedom we've always defended freedom the party was founded to free the slaves from Democrat the party has defended that freedom now human dignity for natural rights to life liberty in the pursuit of happiness Kanye West has the audacity to say not even I'm a Republican or not even I'm a conservative but to say I have independent thought and they're trying to shut him up you'll notice that the right doesn't try to shut people up it's the left that tries to shut people up and harangue them and throw invective and ad hominem attacks the right says give us your ideas say what you think will defeat bad ideas with truth you don't get that from the left and it tells you the whole story right my grandpa always says everybody's entitled to their own stupid opinion which I think I I think encapsulate pretty much what conservatives think you can say what you want but we're free to think it's stupid if we want I wanna go back to this article just for a second though before we run out of time jenissi Coates literally said Kanye West is the mouthpiece of police brutality murder and white supremacy I mean this proves my point this is what I've said all along that liberals when they don't like you they had not only immediately say that you're a racist they immediately now that's morphed a little bit now they say you're a white supremacist because they are racist against white people coat coats is a charlatan his own life proves that the points he tries to make are not true he's made a huge success of himself he's a very good prose writer unfortunately what he writes is false bile but his own life Kanye's own life tells you there isn't a boot keeping you down on the head you can succeed both of these men have exceeded tremendously Kanye is allowing his own life and career to cause him to think that some of the logical conclusions force down his throat aren't true and Coates is desperately trying to cover that up
