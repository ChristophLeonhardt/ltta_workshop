1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,230
AS WE PREDICTED ON LAST WEEK'S
POWER PANEL, THE LARGEST ICEBERG

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,979
IN HUMAN HISTORY HAS NOW BROKEN
FREE FROM ANTARCTICA, TEARING

3
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:10,710
ITSELF OFF OF THE LARSEN SEA ICE
SHELF --

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:32,200
IT HAS BROKEN FREE AS IT HAS
BEEN EXPECTED THAT IT WOULD, AND

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,000
IS FLOATING OFF TO GOD KNOWS
WHERE.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
THAT'S AN AMAZING

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,150
STATISTIC, THAT ICE SHELF LOST
SO MUCH ICE WHEN IT BROKE OFF

8
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,500
THAT IT HAS DROPPED DOWN TO
FIFTH LARGEST ICE SHELF IN

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,680
ANTARCTICA TO FOURTH.

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,400
NOW IT'S FLOATING OFF WHERE IT
MIGHT CAUSE PROBLEMS IN

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,290
SOUTH AMERICA, ON SHIPPING LANES
AND THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT

12
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,650
CERTAINLY IT'S A BAD SIGN FOR
THE DIRECTION OUR PLANET IS

13
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,570
MOVING, OR THAT WE ARE MOVING IT
IN.

14
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,960
IT'S SO LARGE THAT THEY ARE
CONSIDERING REDRAWING THE MAP OF

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,330
ANTARCTICA.

16
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,220
THAT'S AMAZING,
THAT'S HOW BIG OF A PIECE WILL

17
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,320
FLOAT INTO THE SEA.

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,920
IT'S ABOUT
TWO THIRDS OF THE SIZE OF

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
CYPRUS.

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,550
IF YOU SEEN CYPRUS ON A MAP,
IT'S UNDER TURKEY, IT'S BIG.

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,710
IT'S A BIG PORTION OF THE SIZE
OF HAWAII.

22
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,250
FOUR LONDONS.

23
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:37,750
ALMOST THE SIZE OF HAWAII OR
CYPRUS JUST FLOATING AROUND.

24
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,490
TRUMP WILL BUILD A HOTEL ON
IT.

25
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,690
IF HE HAS A CONNECTION TO THE
PRESIDENT OF ANTARCTICA, TRUST

26
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,790
ME, HE WILL TRY.
AND HE WILL SEND DON, JR.

27
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:54,690
THERE, AND HE WILL SAY HE DIDN'T
COLLUDE AT ALL.

28
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,760
THERE'S AN INTERESTING DEBATE
GOING ON THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:02,270
BEFORE THE SHOW, WE KNOW THAT
THIS PARTICULAR ICEBERG BREAKING

30
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,760
OFF IS NOT GOING TO IMMEDIATELY
RAISE OCEAN LEVELS OR ANYTHING

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,900
LIKE THAT, IT WAS A PORTION OF
THE ANTARCTIC WHICH IS ALREADY

32
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,179
IN THE WATER, SO IT DOESN'T
CHANGE FOR IT TO HAVE BROKEN

33
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:13,910
OFF, BUT THERE ARE CONCERNS
ABOUT WHAT SORT OF SIGN THIS

34
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,910
GIVES US FOR CLIMATE CHANGE.

35
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,310
AND
THE SCIENTISTS SEEM TO DISAGREE

36
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,770
A LITTLE BIT IN THIS PARTICULAR
CASE.

37
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,820
A GLACIOLOGIST FROM THE

38
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:40,480
MIDAS TEAM, MARTIN O'LEARY, SAID
--

39
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,520
BECAUSE AS WE EXPLAINED ON
LAST WEEK'S SHOW, WHEN THIS

40
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,590
FRONT FACING SECTION OF THE ICE
SHELF BREAKS OFF IT MAKES IT

41
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,880
EASIER FOR THE ICE FURTHER UP ON
THE ICE SHELF TO GO BEHIND IT.

42
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,400
AND A LOT OF THAT ICE IS NOT
ALREADY IN THE OCEAN, IS

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,620
ACTUALLY ON LAND.

44
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,180
SO WHEN THAT
MOVES AND BREAKS OFF AND GOES

45
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,860
INTO THE OCEAN THAT WILL RAISE
OCEAN LEVELS GLOBALLY.

46
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,860
MARTIN

47
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,370
O'LEARY SAYS THEY DON'T HAVE ANY
SPECIFIC TO HUMAN -INDUCED

48
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,910
CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT NOT ALL
SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT.

49
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,910
ONE

50
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:21,590
SCIENTIST, CHRISTOPHER SHUMAN,
WHO WORKS IN THE AREA 

51
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:29,260
SAID --

52
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:37,090
HISTORICALLY THIS IS JUST THE
LATEST SCARY SIGN --

53
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:48,250
IN THE PREVIOUS DECADE THERE
WAS ANOTHER LARGE SECTION THAT

54
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,250
BROKE OFF.

55
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,890
WE HAD RHODE ISLAND,
NOW WE HAVE DELAWARE, IS THE

56
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,890
NEXT ONE CONNECTICUT?

57
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,550
WILL BE
EVENTUALLY HAVE TEXAS?

58
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,920
WE MIGHT EVENTUALLY GET INTO
RED STATES.

59
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,410
DAMMIT, JOHN, I'M

60
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,920
NOT A SCIENTIST, TALKSHOW HOST.

61
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,230
SO IT'S HARD FOR ME TO JUDGE

62
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,849
WHICH OF THESE SCIENTISTS ARE
RIGHT, AND I'M NOT IN THE

63
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,500
RIGHT-WING CAMP WHICH SAYS
SCIENTISTS, I DON'T BELIEVE

64
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
THEM.

65
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,730
IF A MAJORITY OF THEM SAY
IT'S NOT RELATED TO CLIMATE

66
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,099
CHANGE, AND IT'S NOT A MAJORITY,
THEY ARE SPLIT, THIS IS NOT AN

67
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:23,059
ISSUE WHERE YOU HAVE 97% OF THE
WORLD'S SCIENTISTS ON ONE SIDE,

68
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:25,139
THEN I WILL SAY I GUESS THEY
KNOW BETTER THAN I DO.

69
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,139
BUT AS A

70
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:29,879
MATTER OF LOGIC I'M ON THE SIDE
OF SCIENTISTS WHO SAY OF COURSE

71
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,889
IT'S RELATED.

72
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:35,069
THE REASON WHY IS,
WELL, IF YOU HAVE GLOBAL

73
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:38,990
WARMING, WHICH ALL THE
SCIENTISTS AGREE TO, 97% OF THE

74
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,039
WORLD'S SCIENTISTS, IT WILL MAKE
THAT ICE SHELF WARMER, MAKING IT

75
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:45,810
MORE LIKELY TO BREAK OFF.

76
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,889
THAT
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S THE ONLY

77
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,159
FACTOR, OR EVEN THAT IT WOULDN'T
NECESSARILY HAPPEN OTHERWISE,

78
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:55,800
BUT COULD IT BE HAPPENING
QUICKER BECAUSE IT IS WARMER?

79
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,550
LOGIC SEEMS TO INDICATE ALMOST
CERTAINLY.

80
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,889
AND THEN WHEN YOU

81
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:04,960
LOOK AT JOHN WAS TELLING YOU,
LARSEN A ICE SHELF BROKE OFF IN

82
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:13,770
95, LARSEN B IN '02, AND THIS
ONE IN 2017, THAT'S A TON OF ICE

83
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:18,039
BREAKING OFF EASILY, ESPECIALLY
GIVEN THAT LARSEN B HAD BEEN IN

84
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:21,889
PLACE FOR 10,000 YEARS.

85
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,229
IT SEEMS
TO ME THAT THE WARMING LOGICALLY

86
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:28,469
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT,
AND OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THE

87
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:29,960
SCIENTISTS COME OUT
ON THAT SIDE.

88
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,789
BUT IT'S A LITTLE LESS CLEAR
THAN MOST OF THE CLIMATE

89
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:33,789
CHANGE ISSUES.

90
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:34,789
I WOULD NOT CALL MYSELF AN
EXPERT YET, ALTHOUGH I'M WORKING

91
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:35,789
ON IT, I'VE STUDIED IT A LOT
BOTH IN ACADEMIA AND MORE

92
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:36,789
RECENTLY, I THINK THE STANCE OF
MOST SCIENTISTS IS LESS THAN IT

93
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:37,789
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HUMAN
-INDUCED CLIMATE CHANGE AND MORE

94
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:38,789
THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO
SPECIFICALLY POINT TO THE

95
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:39,789
CONNECTION.

96
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:40,789
THEY DO THE SAME
THING WITH NATURAL DISASTERS,

97
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:41,789
STORMS, INCREASING SIZE AND
INTENSITY OF HURRICANES, YOU

98
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:42,789
CAN'T SAY THAT THIS HURRICANE
WOULDN'T HAVE EXISTED IF NOT FOR

99
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:43,789
CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT YOU WILL SEE
MORE HURRICANES OF A PARTICULAR

100
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:44,789
SORT.

101
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:45,789
AND ALSO, BY THE WAY, THIS
IS THE THING ABOUT SCIENTISTS

102
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:46,789
THAT THE RIGHT-WING KNOWS
NOTHING ABOUT --

103
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:47,789
SCIENTISTS FOR THE MOST PART ARE
MORE HUMBLE THAN THEY SHOULD BE.

104
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:52,960
THEY ARE SLOW TO CLAIM A
CONNECTION UNTIL

105
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,210
PEER-REVIEWED STUDIES SHOW IT.

106
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,849
I DON'T THINK MANY WOULD SAY
THERE IS NO CONNECTION.

107
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:03,849
IF ALL THEY ARE SAYING IS YOU
CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE IF THIS

108
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:07,979
PARTICULAR HURRICANE IS
CONNECTED TO GLOBAL WARMING, OR

109
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,490
THIS PARTICULAR ICE SHELF
BREAKING OFF, THEN OF COURSE WE

110
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,229
AGREE WITH THAT, WE DON'T WANT
TO INHOFFE IT, I STILL HAVE A

111
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:18,830
SNOWBALL SO THERE MUST BE NO
CLIMATE CHANGE, THERE HURRICANES

112
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,689
SO THERE MUST BE CLIMATE CHANGE
-- OF COURSE NOT, THERE WERE

113
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:24,259
HURRICANES BEFORE, ICE SHELVES
HAVE BROKEN OFF BEFORE.

114
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,259
THE

115
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,060
QUESTION IS THE SEVERITY, THE
DEGREE, AND THE SPEED WITH WHICH

116
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,180
IT'S HAPPENING.

117
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,369
I THINK MOST
SCIENTISTS AGREE IT'S A

118
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:38,199
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR, THEY ARE
JUST BEING OVERLY CAUTIOUS IN

119
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,710
OUR INTERPRETATION, THE BEST WE
CAN TELL, IN SAYING YOU CAN'T

120
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,949
TELL THAT IT'S THE PROXIMATE
CAUSE FOR THIS PARTICULAR ICE

121
00:06:44,949 --> 00:00:00,000
SHELF.
