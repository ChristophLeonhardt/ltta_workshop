DERSHOWITZ'S BOOK WE HAVE THE
PROFESSOR WITH US RIGHT NOW, THE
CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING DONALD
TRUMP.
GOOD MORNING.
YESTERDAY WAS CRAZY.
SATELLITE ROD ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD EITHER
RESIGNED, ABOUT TO RESIGN OR WAS
ABOUT TO BE CANNED.
CHAOS IN THE WEST WING, THEY
WERE TRYING TO GET THE STORY
TOGETHER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO
HAPPEN THURSDAY WHEN THEY HAVE A
HEART-TO-HEART?
>> HE IS NOT GOING TO BE THE
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AFTER
THE ELECTION.
THE QUESTION IS TIMING, WHETHER
OR NOT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO
FIRE HIM, WHETHER HE WOULD
PREFER TO HAVE HIM RESIGN,
WHETHER HE WANTS HIM TO BE AN
ELECTION ISSUE, WHAT HAPPENS IN
TERMS OF SUCCESSION, WHO
REPLACES HIM, WHAT IMPACT IT HAS
ON MUELLER, BUT IF YOU ASK ME
WHO IS THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY
GENERAL THE UNITED STATES
STARTING IN JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR
IT WILL NOT BE ROD ROSENSTEIN.
BRIAN: DOES IT MATTER IF HE QUIT
OR IF HE IS FIRED?
>> SURE.
IT BECOMES LESS OF A POLITICAL
ISSUE IF HE RESIGNED BUT EVEN IF
HE RESIGNS THE DEMOCRATS WILL
TURN IT INTO HE RESIGNS AS A
PROTEST AND IS FORCED OUT.
BRIAN: THE PRESIDENT COULD
IMMEDIATELY PUT SOMEBODY IN AS
OPPOSED TO CONFIRMING SOMEBODY.
>> KNOW.
THE PRESIDENT COULD APPOINT AN
INTERN AND HAS TO CONFIRM.
THE DAY HE MENTIONED THE 25TH
AMENDMENT HE WAS OUT.
THIS SHOWS INCREDIBLE IGNORANCE
OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AS A
HARVARD STUDENT, I CAN'T
ATTRIBUTE THAT TO HIM OR A BIAS.
THE 25TH AMENDMENT WAS INTENDED
FOR PRESIDENT WHO WAS SHOT, HAD
A STROKE, IS INCAPACITATED.
NOT A PRESIDENT YOU DISAGREE
WITH OR THINK IS CREATING HAVOC
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
YOU DON'T USE THE 25TH AMENDMENT
PROMISCUOUSLY AND EVEN
MENTIONING THE 25TH AMENDMENT,
THE NEW YORK TIMES STAND BY ITS
STORY, NO JOKE, A SERIOUS
DISCUSSION.
THAT IS DISQUALIFYING.
AINSLEY: THE 25TH AMENDMENT HAS
BEEN TALKED ABOUT FOR WEEKS, IT
HAS BEEN IN HEADLINES BEFORE THE
NEW YORK TIMES STORY ABOUT
ROSENSTEIN, THE ANONYMOUS OP-ED,
YESTERDAY AT THE UN, AMBASSADOR
NIKKI HALEY AND SECRETARY OF
STATE MIKE POMPEO WERE ASKED
ABOUT THIS, IT IS NOT SOMETHING
EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT.
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY CABINET
MEMBERS TALKING ABOUT THAT.
IT IS COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY
ABSURD.
>> NO DISCUSSION WITH ME ABOUT
THE 25TH AMENDMENT IN THE
REPORT, THERE ARE TWO SENIOR
LEADERS WHO SAID THE QUESTION
WAS LUDICROUS.
>> I HAVE BEEN AT THE CENTER OF
THIS ADMINISTRATION WITH OTHER
FOLKS FROM VIRTUALLY DAY ONE.
I NEVER HEARD ANYONE TALK ABOUT
IT, WHISPER ABOUT IT, JOKE ABOUT
IT IN ANY WAY.
AINSLEY: DID YOU BUY IT?
>> THE 25TH AMENDMENT WOULD
CONSTITUTE AN UNLAWFUL COUP FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN AMERICAN
HISTORY.
IT WOULD BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL.
AND NOBODY SHOULD BE TALKING
ABOUT IT.
IF THIS PRESIDENT REMAINS
HEALTHY AND CAPABLE OF MAKING
DECISIONS, NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE
DISAGREE WITH THEM, THE 25TH
AMENDMENT IS OFF THE TABLE.
PETE: WE WILL KNOW ON THURSDAY
NIGHT OF ROD KEEPS HIS JOB.
THURSDAY NIGHT WE WILL ALSO KNOW
ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF BRETT
KAVANAUGH BEFORE THE COMMITTEE.
LAST NIGHT WITH MARTHA
MACCALLUM, DENYING THE
ACCUSATIONS.
>> I HAVE NEVER SEXUALLY
ASSAULTED ANYONE, NOT IN HIGH
SCHOOL, NOT EVER.
I HAVE ALWAYS TREATED WOMEN WITH
DIGNITY AND RESPECT.
I'M LOOKING FOR A FAIR PROCESS.
A PROCESS WHERE I CAN DEFEND MY
INTEGRITY AND CLEAR MY NAME.
ROB: ARE YOU GETTING IT?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
IT DEPENDS ON HOW TOUGH THE
LAWYER IS IN HIS
CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THE ACCUSER
AND HE MUST BE OR SHE MUST BE
TOUGH.
SHE CAN'T JUST BE ALLOWED TO SAY
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND DIDN'T
REMEMBER IT AND IT TOOK ME SIX
DAYS TO RECONSTRUCT MY MEMORY.
A GOOD CROSS-EXAMINING LAWYER
HAS TO BE GENDER FREE, RAISE THE
SAME KIND OF TOUGH QUESTIONS
ABOUT REPRESSED MEMORY AND HOW
TO RECONSTRUCT MEMORY AND
EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS TOLD, BY
WHOM SHE WAS TOLD, WHO MADE
SUGGESTIONS TO HER, HOW DID HER
MEMORY IMPROVE OVER TIME, WE
KNOW BIOLOGICALLY MEMORIES DON'T
IMPROVE OVER TIME.
THEY RECEDE OVER TIME.
HOW DID HER MEMORY GET SO MUCH
BETTER OVER SIX DAYS EVERYTHING
WITH HER LAWYER?
THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF
APPROPRIATE CROSS-EXAMINATION
AND ANY WOMAN OR MAN WHO IS
AFRAID TO BE TOUGH IN
CROSS-EXAMINING HER OR
CROSS-EXAMINING HIM SHOULD NOT
ACT.
PETE: A FEW THAT MEN WILL LOOK
LIKE BULLIES IN THIS ME TOO ERA.
>> THE WOMAN HAS TO BE JUST AS
TOUGH ON BOTH OF THEM.
PETE: DEMOCRATS ARE ASKING THE
FBI TO LOOK INTO THAT AND THE
HIGH SCHOOL STORY.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
>> WHEN YOU ARE UP FOR A
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT THE FBI
SHOULD BE CONTINUOUSLY UPDATING
ITS INVESTIGATION, THE MINUTE AN
ALLEGATION COMES OUT THE FBI
SHOULD BE ON TOP OF IT.
DOESN'T NEED TO START SOMETHING
A NEW.
I HAVE 500 STUDENTS TO APPOINTED
POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY, I HAVE
BEEN INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI OVER
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, NO
MATTER HOW TRIVIAL THE ISSUE IS,
THEY WILL ASK ME ABOUT IT.
IT CAN ONLY BE DONE IN A BRIEF
PERIOD OF TIME.
IT CAN BE DONE WITHIN 3 OR 4
DAYS.
PETE: YOU SAID AVENATTI IS
HURTING YOUR PROFESSION,
DEMOCRATS, YOU ARE NOT HELPING.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T THINK HE HELPS HIMSELF.
HE MAY HELP HIMSELF IN THE SENSE
OF GETTING MORE CLIENTS BUT HE
HAS ACTED LESS THAN RESPONSIBLY.
NOT ONLY IN THIS INSTANCE BUT
OTHER INSTANCES AS WELL.
BRIAN: WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE
HEARING?
>> IT DEPENDS.
IF BRETT KAVANAUGH IS AS
PERSUASIVE AS HE WAS ON
TELEVISION THE OTHER DAY, AND
SHE IS CROSS-EXAMINED
EFFECTIVELY, MOVED TO A
CONFIRMATION.
HEARINGS ARE UNPREDICTABLE AND
