hello and Happy New Year you're probably
thinking Alex supposed to be on a
meditation retreat well that's true
right now I'm probably sitting in
silence in Gloucester not saying
anything to anyone or doing anything
just for ages just nothing but I'm also
here in my boat with a nice fire going
eating a vegan burger made of gluten on
the opposite of gluten-free I just need
a big lump of gluten in a bun and a
vegan pizza with cheese vegan ham
mushrooms artichokes and olives
it's pretty nice than it George is not
in these are both for me I couldn't
decide between the Peter in the burgers
so I just bought both and I thought I
just felt like playing your song it's
not related to the food that's just me
sitting a sink way this is a song from
my most recent album I don't think I've
ever played it to you before it's about
I see okay so I write a lot of songs
about love and girls and I wanted to
write a song that was just about my
mates and one of the people that stick
by me and that I know I can count on
this is a song about them
excuse me hello darlin oh yeah I'm all
right mate can i phone you back in like
a couple of minutes cuz I'm just filming
a video the moment
all right cool I'll you back in a
bit
there will be winter there will be
there will be keeping me
I lost my head
then I see you and your garden do
I'll try my best to make time to express
my gratitude
for y'all
Peola partners in crime
