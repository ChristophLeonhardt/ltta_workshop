Laura: A FEW MORE LIBERAL REPUBLICANS ARE PUSHING A BILL IN THE HOUSE TO LEGALIZE B12 AND PROTECT THE SO-CALLED DREAMERS FROM DEPORTATION. HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN DISMISS THE MEASURE AS A SHOW PONY AND SAID HE WANTS TO BUILD A PRESIDENT CAN SIGN. THE BILL IS ALSO AT ODDS WITH HOW CONSERVATIVES WHO FAVOR CONGRESSMAN BOB GOODLATTE TOUGH, SMART, PRAGMATIC IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT MEASURE. LET'S DISCUSS WHERE THIS IS ALL HEADING. IT'S A THREE CARD MONTE GOING ON ABOUT IMMIGRATION. DAVE BRAT, THIS IS WILD BECAUSE IF PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS MODERATE LIBERAL REPUBLICAN PUSH FOR A DACA BILL AND SAYING THAT IS THE PATHWAY TO THE GOODLATTE BILL, WHAT? IT'S NOT A PATHWAY TO THE GOOD LOVE BILL. IT'S A NIGHTMARE. THERE IS A COMPLICATED TECHNICAL THING. FOUR BILLS AND PLAY. GOODLATTE WON'T PASS. WHAT DOES PASS QUESTIONING THE DREAMER BILL. 3.6 MILLION DREAMERS WITH JANE IN TEN YEARS IT'S 10 MILLION ILLEGAL GRANTED PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP. SPEAKER RYAN SAID WE ARE GOING TO PASS THE GOODLATTE BILL. IT IT IS IN COMMITTEE. MEMBERS TOLD ME IT HASN'T PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE. THAT'S THE FIRST STEP. IF THEY WANT TO WHIP IT, THEY CAN GET THE GOODLATTE BILL. Laura: EVERYONE WATCHING NEEDS TO KNOW PAUL RYAN, WE LIKE PAUL RYAN BUDDIES ON HIS WAY OUT HAS NOT MOVED THIS BILL IN THE COMMITTEE. THE COMMITTEE HAS TO MOVE IT OUT TO CONSIDER ABOUT ON THE FLOOR. IT HAS TO GO TO THE SENATE. THE SENATE IS NOT GOING TO PROVE THE GOODLAD BILL. 60 VOTES IN THE SENATE IS A PROBLEM. YOU CAN USE IT FOR THE MIDTERMS. CAN I PLAY SOMETHING FOR YOU. THE PRESIDENT TONIGHT WAS IN INDIANA. THIS MADE ME SMILE. LET'S WATCH. JOE DONNELLY VOTED AGAINST ENHANCED VETTING. THINK OF THAT. WHAT, WHAT IN THE WORLD WOULD ANYBODY BE DOING VOTING AGAINST ENHANCED VETTING? WHY? THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. Laura: ENHANCED VETTING FOR PEOPLE COMING INTO THE COUNTRY. WHO THEY ARE, WHY THEY'RE HERE, REFUGEES OR ANYONE ELSE. THE GOODLAD BILL DOES EVERYTHING WE WANT. E-VERIFY, CHAIN MIGRATION, BUILDS THE WALL. EVERYTHING. SENATOR OBAMA WAS FOR ALL OF THAT. Laura: HE WAS MR. BORDER HAWK. THE GOODLATTE BILL IS A COPPER VISE. THE DEMOCRATS ASKED THOUSAND DACA, GET THEM OUT OF THE SHADOWS MIGHT GIVE THEM PATHWAY TO STATUS. WE SAID OKAY, WILL COMPROMISE WITH YOU. TRUMP OFFERS 2 MILLION. A BIGGER COMPROMISE. DEMOCRATS SAY NO. NOW WE HAVE 25 REPUBLICANS DOING AN END RUN WITH 200 DEMOCRATS. THAT'S THE PLAY. THE PEOPLE AT HOME MISSED THE MAIN POINT, IT'S 25 REPUBLICANS LEAPFROGGING OVER LEADERSHIP. IF THEY GET 25 Laura: ALL THEY NEED IS 25. AND THEN DACA IS THE LAW OF THE LANDS. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. EVERYBODY WATCHING UNDERSTANDS WE NEED THE GOODLATTE BILL. IT'S A TRICK PONY. IT'S NOT A SHOW PONY. IT'S A TROJAN HORSE. Laura: WE ARE ON EVERY EQUINE REFERENCE HERE.
