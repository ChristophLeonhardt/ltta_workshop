welcome to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser coming to you from Pensacola Florida where we're gonna hear some Blues later on this evening and Mixon kind of get involved and some of the interesting things happening here in Pensacola a lot of guys with dark eye glasses and baseball hats seems almost like a CIA confab or something Stacey I think you'll find it's NSA down here if anything it's interesting because we're in the civil quarter of Pensacola it's like a hundred years old this building is a hundred years old we're in a bar you might hear some noise behind us because we've been here for about half an hour and it's been super quiet and suddenly as soon as we start recording everybody starts working behind us so you'll hear some noise around us but like hopefully we'll have some b-roll to show you the the ceiling the walls how amazing the structure is we have these giant moose heads on the wall and that's relevant to this first headline here the construction how solid this foundation is how so versus tell us everything a 58 story skyscraper in San Francisco is tilting and sinking and residents say their multi-million dollar condos are nearly worthless millennium tower is a luxury residential high-rise that has sunk 17 inches and tilted 14 inches since it was completed in 2008 though in an inspection by the city showed it safe to occupy the situation has sparked an exodus from the building residents say they are selling multi-million dollar condos at a loss with the value of their homes tumbling by three hundred and twenty thousand dollars on average it's the city's fourth highest skyscraper as one of these luxury condos that has gone up in San Francisco I believe we talked about this with Wolfe Richter a few like two three years ago at that time was only tilting like four inches that's 14 inches and I say it safe well it's the leaning tower of geeks deleting tower of nerds over there in San Francisco have all these tourists over there with those photos of with the relationship shots of them pushed keeping the tower up and they'll get a lot of people doing those photos it's a moneymaker though make money on the leaning tower of geeks in San Francisco I predict so well let's go over some of the points that Business Insider points out here it was completed in 2008 and the first five weeks of sales millennium tower sold 100 million dollars worth of condos the San Francisco Chronicle reported the units range in price from 1.6 million to 10 million dollars and the developers of millennium tower Millennium Partners argue that construction nearby is to blame for any sinking or tilting a city transportation hub the trans Bay Transit Center broke ground next door in 2010 and they call it a process of dewatering so when they were building this transportation hub next door what they had to do is they had to drain all the water out of the ground in order to make sure that the the ground under the transportation hub was stable good subside ins as they call it in the retail trade yes the San Francisco's 9/11 this is the geek apocalypse there are 5 million dollar condos there tilting and falling into the Bay Area oh my gosh well the important thing is actually San Francisco sits on the San Andreas Fault which is known to have massive earthquakes and the fact that the next door neighbor the neighboring building had to be water suggests that this is ground prone to liquefaction so this is really important that when earthquakes happen and really bad things buildings fall down as partly because the ground beneath them becomes like liquid so any building it doesn't matter how strong the structure is it's gonna fall yeah we said there should be an after that like snapchat could build glasses with built in kind of video cameras so that if the building starts to shake violently the glasses automatically adjust for the violent shaking and he look like you're completely stable so they shouldn't panic there because they've got an app for earthquake it got an app for the apocalypse it's all solved so as I said this building the millennium tower was not built into the bedrock so this is quite important because millennium tower sits on land prone to liquefaction the process by which loose sand and silt behave like liquid in the event of an earthquake the seismic activity causes water pressure in the sediment to increase and grains of sand to lose contact with each other according to the US Geological Survey the soil may give out under large heavy structures well you know it's ironic that the Silicon Valley has people living in a tower that's about to be engulfed by silicon which is basically sand sand is ya know what that's what it is that's where that comes from sand this is why I haven't become a 500 billion dollar player in San Francisco yet I'm confusing this these two things well anyway so what I'm saying is here's a building it's one of these mega structures we've been covering here in Kaiser report with Wilfred der Waal street comm looking at the bubble in San Francisco property prices are booming but now it turns out a lot of these projects were put up rapidly they're not built into the bedrock they've been D watered a situation nearby so the ground is subsiding and we have this giant structure tilting wildly now speaking of not being built in the bedrock I'm gonna segue to another story here really good segue there a subtle I hardly noticed it well I thought you would run with segue I know you like to have a segue now which I you know drive around the house and property with it's the segue mini they go ups up to ten kilometers an hour so I'm gonna try to draw an analogy between the millennium Tower tilting by 14 inches sunk 17 inches not built into the bedrock subject to collapse because of liquefaction to the Democratic Party Oh Harvey Weinstein okay so no no no we've already covered that but we're going back to the Democratic Party because right now they're still like seeking some sort of a leader they've they've thrown everything behind Hillary Clinton and she was not built on solid foundation of a bedrock so here we have the headline democratic advantage for 18 might not be what it seems a democratic and in preference for the 2018 midterm elections fades to insignificance among the most likely voters in the latest ABC news/washington post poll signs of the Democrats and during challenges and turning out their voters in off year contests so in a hypothetical National ballot mac's Democratic congressional candidates hold a rebus 11-point lead over their GOP counterparts but it's a dead heat if you look at just those who are likely to vote that's a dead heat between the Democrats and the Republicans despite all the craziness of the Trump administration what songs popularity is on the way up so he got rid of a lot of the garbage that he had to get done in year one and now he's going to roll out some showcase programs and of course America keeps going higher and the Hillary Clinton fans and Democrats they have a problem of putting all of their efforts into chasing the fake Russia gaint hoax and they're not there for they don't have the resources to go field new candidates that might have a chance of 2018 so if they were to drop the Russia Gate hoax and focus on just finding candidates to run in 2018 they might have a chance but at this rate they don't have a chance which means that they probably won't have a chance to 2020 either well you know I I don't mean to belabor this analogy but the fact is that these buildings that are not put into the bedrock on a land prone to seismic shifts you know this is the the voter will change their mind if you don't provide them with some sort of economic policies or financial is you know policies or anything they don't want to hear though though they'll shift if you don't have some sort of bedrock policy and right now I think when we look at the Democrats they're not they're just a little bit nicer on the progressive a social sort of level but their policies their economic policies are just as brutal as what the mainstream Republicans are now Trump came along obviously and we've already covered this a thousand times and he offered basically Bernie Sanders economic platform he went out to the Rust Belt and he said I'm gonna get rid of TPP and TTIP and all these trade deals that are making you lose everything and they went with that so they but they built everything on Hillary Clinton who was like one of these sinking candidates tilting and built not on red bedrock but she was subject to liquefaction and falling over and tumbling in the actual vote look we just drove all the way through the state of Georgia and we saw Trump pants trump pants and everybody in that area they have the Cracker Barrel you know they were talking Trump pants you know they're still solidly behind Trump no reason not to be he's talking jobs jobs are up markets up there's no reason for them not to be behind Trump and so they're looking good for 18 and 20 again like going back the article here is about the Democrats the fact that they don't have a platform all they have is a Trump is a trump tweets too much Trump is they have a platform it's called the gallows you know and once they put the noose around these folks like Clinton Hillary and the rest they are gonna open up the trapdoor and then we can get rid of these bums for once and for all so back to this article they talk about the Democratic polls where where they are actually not gaining any support where they are actually going to have a problem in 2018 what the polls show is that the main change for congressional Democrats from their peak in 2009 moreover is diminished trust and some of their key support groups under 30s are down 27 points in trust Democrats themselves down 26 points and liberals down 21 points so they're losing trust among the younger population I mean obviously there's a shift a seismic shift on what you know we've had we've had for the last 30 years the baby boomers running everything they've been the largest voting bloc everything is geared towards what they want a need now the Millennials are the bigger block nobody knows what they want to need Bernie Sanders with his anti trade deal stories and pitch did grab on to something Trump's people whether it was Trump or his people were smart enough to steal his best ideas wearing up to 2016 remember Michael Moore a very publicly stated tenors how Trump can win they said he could win it was constant he could appeal to voters he laid out the Trump gameplan and this is exactly what Trump did Trump won the electoral college exactly as Michael Moore who's a lefty predicted Trump RIT would win let me return the favor and say here now exactly how the Democrats can win 2018 in 2020 I can give you the game plan right now but you'll ignore it because you're idiots simply go after Wall Street banks go after the bankers even though there are your big source of funds you've got to bite the bullet and appeal to the voter and say we're going to go after financial crime we're going to go after bankers are going to start raising interest rates so your money is worth something that's a winning strategy for 2018 or 2020 if they won't do it because they are on a suicide mission call the Democratic Party and of course there's no pushback from their favored media MSNBC you know they're speaking to those same voters that are already got the baby boomers that the both parties but especially the Democratic Party has liked that all their policies are about the baby boomers so here is the consequence of it and this next chart as well that kind of goes with these polling going on because you would think with all these scandals investigations Story screeching outrage hashtag the resistance all of this stuff that there was you know an apocalypse facing the Republican Party but here's this chart in a 2016 rematch Clinton loses more base support than Trump percentage of East candidates party who say they voted for their nominee in 2016 versus how many would do so again so you see the blue line Clinton is has lost far more than Trump has lost it's like weekend in Hillary's oh my god Hillary is a political corpse she's gone she's left the hurt prop corpus is long gone and do the either stay tuned for the second half a whole lot more welcome back to the cosmic port time now to go to San Francisco let's talk with wolf Richter of Wolfe Street calm blades gentle wolf Richter yay wolf welcome back well thanks for having me back on your show max all right wolf we've talked to you over the years about the housing bubble which seems to grow more insane by the year in the retail sector one which has definitely imploded let's get an update first on housing what's going on wolf well we have some very interesting very big housing bubbles in various cities around the country and just a little study yesterday on what's going on in San Francisco we had an enormous spike in single-family house prices in October I mean enormous going up to almost 1.6 million dollars and that's a that's a huge jump it's a 13 percent jump from a year ago at the same time and they're kind of nuts in San Francisco because you really aren't that many houses it's mostly apartments or condos what we call tea I see so tendency in common apartments and which is sort of a different version for condo and rental apartments so there's not that many there's not a lot of single family houses so what sells is mostly really apartment units and in the condo sector they have levelled out so that they jump up and down you know but they year over a year they were down just a little bit since 2015 condos really have and outside of the noise you know they're jumping up and down but really haven't moved much so it seems like their condos have bumping into a ceiling but on the house and there's a new phenomenon that we ran into now it's kind of a regular phenomenon for October is we have we had 38 very expensive houses that sold in October and when you have a median price when the number of sales at the extreme ends increase it really moves up the median price and so this is a kind of an unusual circumstance for the rest of the year but in October it's a fairly common occurrence that we have a large number of luxury sales that move the scale and then usually in November December this drops back down and and and then we get to point at the collapse and house prices in San Francisco for a few months yeah but wolf you know Apple Computer it's gonna be worth a trillion dollars and all those nasdaq listed technology stocks are worth trillions of dollars and people live there they're good and it's funny money you know what's the big if I'm making twenty you know a million in months at Google yeah or more so what I pay two million for a house what's the big deal it's nothing I mean they got a lot of almost people there and that's a big problem is it going to be like that city I'm I'm reading about that's got a huge problem now with disease on the street hepatitis due to the feet the fecal matter that's accumulated on the street it's now infecting everybody they've got an outbreak of hepatitis in San Francisco is it similar they've got like rolling fecal matter up and down the sidewalk from the homeless people due to the billionaires that are basically defecating onto the American economy and not paying any taxes well there certainly are a lot of homeless people not just from San Francisco it's just a very easy climate a relatively easy climate to be homeless in so these people come from other parts of the country but it is a huge problem it is a huge problem for a number of reasons one it just clearly shows the disparity between a very small part of the economy that is doing really well and I mean even Apple employees unless you're way up there you know you're struggling with with finding decent housing these days and and but at the at the middle-class level so I know teachers and firemen and and those kinds of people lost jobs you know it is what we call a housing crisis and it's the other end of the housing crisis that we used to have this is a crisis for a middle-class do HR in a household can afford to live in some of those cities in the Bay Area and and they're leaving yeah and those that get pushed out by our rents or by by extraordinary home prices no no some of them myself have left and and they wanted a larger home that could make it in San Francisco yeah they leave the Bay Area or they they yeah they leave San Francisco at least and so this is a this is called the limit we're seeing and in the combat area commas are you know in San Francisco they're they're not the similar more luxury condos but most of our the central middle class and when in the middle class can't afford them anymore they you know they stop buying them and so we have this sort of ceiling in condo prices were for the last two years that I really haven't been able to get past that and that makes perfect sense because you you know a lot of jobs a lot of companies are moving jobs out of San Francisco to it because it's too expensive and they can't they can't really make it work here and so employment has stalled in San Francisco and the Bay or in general we've had some declines recently in total employment numbers so it's it's a it's a system that's out of whack but there's starting to be some sort of sense that it can't go out of whack much more before you know the it will shift and the shift may not be what we would like by the way the city with the fecal matter that is engulfing the population and hepatitis is San Diego over there in the West Coast not far from you you know listen T described a problem of unaffordable housing I mean why doesn't Tim Cook CEO of Apple who just moved his tax-dodging Affairs from Ireland to Jersey in the UK why can't he put up a few thousand folks in Jersey where his money is you know it's not it's not getting any taxable income in America he might be able to house these people it's like a battery chicken farm you know they put in like ten thousand chickens into a coop and then they just squeeze the eggs here Tim Cook's got a battery coating farm you've got all these bright Harvard graduates cranking out code and mining Bitcoin and Tim Cook's got them living in a freaking dumpster it's beautiful it's capitalism it's America yeah they're already starting to build some housing for their own employees Facebook is starting to plan on that and some other companies are trying to do that near their campuses yeah the problem with Apple is that this money actually isn't an island or in Jersey or wherever it's actually in the United States it's invested in US bonds and government bonds and corporate bonds all kinds of things the the problem is that and that's you can't do that it's no problem what he cannot do is invest this money in its business and so I can't use this always needs money to buy back its own shares and they can't use it we have to do some other business thing so it yeah it's served its invested it's not like it's right I think that's an important distinction in other words Apple's got roughly and last I checked two hundred sixty billion dollars that they park overseas but that's a misnomer it's actually right there in Cooper town Cooper do whatever Silicon Valley but they just have it on the books it says you know France but it's actually just a big pile of cash in the backyard of Apple but they call it you know France they call it Jersey but they can't use it for different purposes because then that would be a tax liability and God forbid Tim Cook's of painting taxes I mean after all you know he's got some magnificent slave-labor made goods over there but anyway so San Francisco it's the housing bubble and we started off by talking about the retailing also the retail sector is that just by another good hearted American capitalist Jeff besos teaming dr. mengele of Wall Street what's happening in the retail sector well we have one point of the retail sector that is booming and that's online retail and it's ecommerce that is soaring the there's a structural shift underway in the United States globally really from buying at local stores and buying at malls to buying online I have some younger neighbors here I don't know if they ever go out tomorrow they get new packages every day and and you know some of the Generation X people and some of the baby boomers still show up at the mall but it's really a massive shift and you know there's some retail that is so-called ecommerce proof for now that's new and used vehicle sales and that's yeah that's 21 percent of total retail it's gasoline sales it's another seven and eight percent of retail restaurants and bars another big chunk and groceries there Amazon would love to get into groceries and it's trying to get into groceries but it just it's greatest frustration it's it's not easy in the United States to sell groceries online so those sectors combined about 55 percent of total retail and they're not under there kind of an attack but it's really they're defending themselves in there so far they've been holding off online sales but the other 45% of retail are completely open to attack from online retailers and and that's mostly what is being sold at malls and so their share of what they've lost to online retailers large is it's between 20% and a quarter in toys it's like 35 percent of toy sales I've moved on I have moved to online if you come video games it's even higher so these percentages are very large once you focus on the types of retailers that are being attacked by by e-commerce and once you eliminate those that are still getting a free ride for now right well of course Amazon's Jeff Bezos wants to get into prescription drugs and you know you merge that with the opiate crisis in America you've got out-of-control pharmaceutical companies who are getting millions of people hooked on heroin synthetic heroin for profit the crystal knocked of the pharmaceutical business has arrived in America and then combine that with Amazon and you've got Jeff Bezos arriving to your home via drone and he'll shoot you up on your doorstep if you're a Mossad prime it cost $20 for that hit and you can get away watching Netflix and Kevin Spacey molest somebody it's a deal I'm telling you it's a deal yeah now they're they're coming up with the new system or you don't even have to open the door where the with with the help of a camera and a smart door lock you know the Amazon delivery guy can can come in the house and so maybe you don't even have to step outside - yeah smack he'll come into your house and give you the anecdote you know the Epis up the I forget if they call it but that's great you know that's American capitalism in and we should applaud that because it's it's leading to some really interesting outcomes so going forward what are you see in 2018 more drugs and housing bubbles yeah the housing bubbles will go on in some markets i I suspect that the housing bubble in San Francisco is running into a problem right now I see that in condo sales there's a lot of supply coming on the market that's the case in other cities - rents are already heading down and some of the most expensive markets including San Francisco New York City and others so you know there's some there are some basic issues involved here were yeah we got to wrap it up well basically I think the rents are coming down in these markets because a lot of the tenants are actually now dead alright well thanks for being on the show well thanks for having me all right well that's going to do it for this edition there's on be a pocalypse version of Kaiser report want to thank our guest wolf Richter if you want to catch us on Twitter it skies the report until next time bye
