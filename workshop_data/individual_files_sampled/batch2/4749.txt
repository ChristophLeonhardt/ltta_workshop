justice correspondent Pete Williams is standing by and Pete I understand you've got some some new information here as it relates to the number of those who have been killed and how many are students and how many years are teachers and staff right several things here first of all we're now told by several officials that the total number of deaths is not as 10 9 students and one teacher one adult at the school for a total of 10 is the number of people we believe is the current correct number about how many were killed in the shooting today the second thing I would just point out having watched these live reports from the scene of these other searches it's not clear to us that in fact explosive devices were found at these other locations that are being searched we know that they were found inside the school we believe it's two or possibly more but at least two pipe bombs were found in the school and we don't believe that they went off the authorities are now trying to or were earlier trying to render them safe so I suspect that's been done but the logical question they ask is where were they built were there other explosive devices that they had made so they're naturally going to search locations connected with the two suspects they have the 17 year old male whose name we're now going to report we've been holding off on this but the 17 year old will talk we're told by a large number of local and federal officials is Demetrios podg√≥rze Asst PA geo you RT z is who was a student our currently is not sure about whether he still as a student athlete there are certainly a student at one time a member of the football team whether he still is or not I don't know that for sure but we've been looking for the last couple of hours at social media connected with him and nothing stands out to us nor according to the federal officials I've been talking to does it to them that would indicate a possible motive here there's no expressed interest for example in any kind of radical ideology no no interest in Isis no interest in any kind of domestic radical extremism of any ilk nothing stands out about him that we've been able to see here so why this happened of course remains a huge mystery and then of course we're still trying to determine how many weapons were used in the shooting and whether the shooting happened inside or outside the school we still don't know the answer to that can you give us the last name one more time Pete Demetrius can can you spell it one more time yeah so it's Demetrios di M ITR i/os haggart's Asst PA G o u RT Z is a 17 year old student at the school who at one time at least was a student athlete a member of the football team and Pete this this other person who is also in custody who's been detained rather this person of interest what more do we know about this person he's been identified to us we're still trying to confirm the name from some from more than two or three sources here but we believe that he is not 17 that he is older than 17 he's and whether he's a current student or not I don't know but you know to your point what was his role in this we don't know the answer to that yet do we know anything about his relationship with the 17 year old student suspect no we don't okay our justice correspondent Pete Williams continuing to talk to sources and provide some new information we now have a name of the gunman a name that we will not be using at nauseam here on the air but we have a name of the gunman a student athlete at one point at least at this school he was according to Pete a member of the football team as well Pete also updating the total number of dead at this point we know that there are according to sources nine students and one teacher who had been killed at Santa Fe High School here in Texas this is just outside Houston Texas Santa Fe of the city of about 13,000 about 30 miles southeast of Houston Texas
