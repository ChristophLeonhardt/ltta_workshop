walnuts oatmeal is one of the foods with

the highest amount of soluble fiber

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,950
soluble fiber stays in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> stomach for</font>

12
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,519
black beans are great for energy because

13
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">they have two nutrients that are key</font>

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,130
protein and fiber protein and fiber help

you to feel full for longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also</font>

00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,730
really gets you nourished and sustained

23
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,949
for hours and prevents energy crashes

24
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,660
these foods are all very similar when it

25
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes to helping with energy levels</font>

26
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,379
