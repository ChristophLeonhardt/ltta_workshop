but I think Evan Soloman got under her skin a bit this time because he asked her about Jason Kenney who's probably going to be the premier of Alberta next year and Doug Ford who could well be the Premier of Ontario this year and Brad wall the outgoing he's the former premiers of schedule three prominent articulate political leaders who are utterly opposed to her carbon tax and unlike 99% of reporters Evan Soloman didn't drop the question after one go he pressed her with supplemental questions and she started to look ridiculous and then I don't think she meant to she went off message track and she's sort of lashed out look at this but let's be clear like climate change has huge costs now I have no time for folks who are like you know we shouldn't take action like you know yeah no time you gotta have time you got it well your job is to have time for folks that care about this issue and understands you gotta have this is this is the problem that people say the Liberals smack of arrogance your job is to have time for people who disagree with you I have time for Canadians who disagree with me a flash of anger there no time for folks who are don't deniers that's what she calls people who disagree with her deniers on anything really they're deniers an appropriate appropriate and the phrase Holocaust deniers I've seen global warming extremists do this before they claim that global warming it's like a Holocaust and if you disagree with their theories and their plans you're a denier like a Holocaust denier and so your skepticism doesn't have to be answered your questions are not valid because you're just a climate not seen we don't debate Nazis we don't debate whether the Holocaust I'm not exaggerating they try and apropriate that here's an example in Australia a couple years ago there's a theatrical play called kill climate deniers not very subtle oh and they actually named a global warming skeptics buying names so yeah it's part of the extreme demonization we don't debate deniers now let me back up a minute and ask a very basic question of our pull the string pre-recorded message climate Barbie what did she mean by denier someone who denies that the globe is warming like the United Nations itself that has noticed an 18 year hiatus where the world's climate has actually stayed the same according to satellite measurements or maybe someone who denies its warming enough to be a problem as in someone who notes that the globe has been very very gradually warming for about 150 years and in fact we're still actually emerging from the great Ice Age about 10,000 years ago someone maybe she means someone who denies that mankind has anything to do with this that we're just literally a drop in the ocean compared to natural global warming including the number-one source of global warming which is water vapor or maybe she means someone who denies that we in the West especially here in Canada have really anything to do with this noting that China is by far the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide or maybe she means someone who denies that putting a carbon tax on Canadians will actually deal with anything I've just mentioned I mean theoretically you can believe that the earth is warming because of your SUV and still deny that paying Justin Trudeau and Catherine McKenna more taxes would do anything about it you'd still be labeled a denier and Catherine McKenna doesn't want to have anything to do with you at all and you know I bet if you ask most Canadians if they deny any link in that chain the world is warming we caused it it's warming too much it's our fault here in Canada we can do something about it and the carbon tax is way to fix it I bet seriously that a majority of Canadians would challenge at least one of those parts of that syllogism in fact I know they - that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch The Daily Show every day including always - interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
