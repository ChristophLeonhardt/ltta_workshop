well the standoff between Washington and Pyongyang is set to continue in 2018 with North Korea's leader targeting the u.s. in his New Year speech Kim jong-un stressed he had the nuclear button at hand the entire US mainland is within the range of a nuclear strike and the button is always on the table in my office they should clearly know that this is certainly not a threat but rather a reality well to discuss this situation further we can cross live now to Chinese international relations specialist Victor gavotte - thank you very much indeed for joining us this New Year's day well what's your reaction then to Kim's nuclear button warning thank you happy new year I think the remark by the leader of DPRK is highly irresponsible and is to be stopped or discouraged by all means why Oh DPRK has the right to defend itself to threaten to use the nuclear weapon against another country to cover all its territory is really beyond any reasonable statement and I hope personally that such rhetoric either by the side of DPRK by its supreme leader or by the United States through its president donald trump will calm down the world does not need such jingoism or war rhetorics the world need peace and we need to work with every party concerned to bring about peace on the Korean Peninsula and in that particular region well Kim says the Pyongyang's nuclear treatments they would deter the u.s. from ever attacking but do you agree I personally do not agree I think DPRK has a legitimate point to defend itself and to repair any kind of an invasion from outside but to use nuclear weapon as a mean to achieve this goal is really beyond reasonable calculation especially because this is completely against all the resolutions adopted by the United Nations Security Council as well as by the I ei and therefore I think a DPRK should negotiate with the United States and all the other relevant parties to make sure that they can maintain stability and the peace while giving up the nuclear weapons this will be the highway this will be the better way okay and that's therefore looking it's a diplomatic solution but do you expect international pressure to grow against North Korea in the wake of these latest comments I think there are already a whole range of international sanctions initially by the United Nations Security Council they are putting pressure on DPRK but as far as DPRK nuclear weapon program is concerned it's not achieving the magic result at all and it is expected that DPRK will continue to develop and soften to make it more sophisticated their nuclear weapons system therefore I'm afraid that the situation of the DPRK and on the Korean Peninsula is faster reaching a tipping point something need to be done and I think before everything is exhausted we still need to rely on peace and negotiation and diplomacy before any attempt is tried to find other ways to achieve denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and victim very briefly if you could just sum up how do you see the North Korean u.s. relationship unfold the sharing in just a sentence or two what do you think now I think DPRK is worried about threats from the United States in terms of regime change or assassination of its leader or are simply invasion into its territory and they have developed the nuclear weapon in order to achieve survival of the regime and defending their country but by threatening to use the nuclear weapon against the United States is very irresponsible and I think it's not to be tolerated in Dayton we'll leave it there victory our Chinese international relations specialists thank you few thoughts thank you
