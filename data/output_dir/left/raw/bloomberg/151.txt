1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,040
It's been awful year for apple at least
by the company's high standards

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,280
and I have an uninspiring message for the
company's fans and investors

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,930
wondering when Apple's tide will turn:

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,430
Wait until
next year.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,960
Apple's revenues declined for the last
two quarters and probably will continue

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,550
to fall for the next six months. The last
time apple sales dropped for 12 months

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,060
straight was 2001. Mark Zuckerberg was
still in high school.

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,710
Apple stock has also dropped twenty six
percent from an all-time high in

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,270
February 2015. The company's product
wizards are keeping busy but the next

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,340
year won't be a blockbuster. The newly
updated iPhones Apple will show off

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,390
at an event on wednesday

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,989
no matter what they're called will be
more like tweaked versions of the iPhone 6s

13
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,760
breaking with Apples pattern of
having significant updates in

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,949
even-numbered years. Also coming are
fresh models of some Mac computers and a

15
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,170
second generation Apple watch.

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,339
None of these products will be surprises
but they should help Apple sales grow

17
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,290
again least modestly after this holiday
season. The big hopes for a major sales

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,689
rebound are riding on 2017. Expectations
are building that Apple will pull out a

19
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,680
dramatically different iPhone a year
from now with a new type of super thin

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,159
screen that could spark a big wave of
new iPhone sales

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,890
it's been five years since Tim Cook took
over as Apple CEO and the company has

22
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,780
become even more financially successful
but it doesn't have a breakout new "wow"

23
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,270
product category under his watch.

24
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,009
Wait until next year isn't a great
rallying cry but it's the best Apple can do.

25
00:01:41,009 --> 00:00:00,000
