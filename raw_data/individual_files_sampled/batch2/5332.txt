for NBC News Steve Kornacki joining me once again Steve again you've been watching these numbers it seems like we have an answer we have an apparent winner in the battle Vania special election for the House District in the 18th Connor Lamb the Democrat NBC News is declaring the apparent winner over Rick ciccone the Republican now I can take you through what that wording means obviously we have been telling you all night well since about 11 o'clock last night we're waiting on Washington County we're waiting on the absentee vote in Washington County and you had a lead there of about 750 votes for Connor Lam district wide coming into that so what was gonna happen in Washington County we knew it was a Republican County the question was hey and these absentee x' was that gonna be a little different so I can show you finally oh my god we waited all night for these numbers here are the absentee numbers from West from Washington County for Conner Lam 609 he netted 609 from that pool and for rick Ciccone for the republican louis 547 so that was what we suspected was gonna happen in public in County but we were saying these absent T's were favoring lam throughout the district we saw it in Allegheny we saw in Westmoreland a Republican County we said we think we'll see it in Washington but we got to see it to say we saw it well now we see it he beat out rick Ciccone in the absentee ballots in washington county so what does that do that actually increases his lead their district wide just a little bit so we say he's the apparent winner it is a very close margin here as you can see that is 641 votes that's separating them right now 641 we still have a couple of pieces of business here just keep this in mind Greene County has 200 absentee ballots they will be counted today I hope those 200 absentee ballots we really do have a pattern here though where these absentee counts lam is doing a lot better than the absentee than in the election day so again you don't really see Ciccone making up anything based on everything we've seen in those 200 in Greene then what do we have we got military ballots they're gonna be counted within the next week probably about a week from now how many of those are there we're not sure we think dozens you know 75 may be in the district again ciccone is probably gonna win more of those than lam but we're talking dozens here we're not talking a lot then the final little piece here is provisional ballots there's you know in the low hundreds of these you know maybe 200 something like that again we don't know the exact number we suspect when you get up here in Allegheny County probably gonna favor lamb there we're not sure the rest of the district but what you're seeing as you can see when you get outside of Washington County what we just announced so few outstanding votes outside Washington County sit here ciccone you needed to take the lion's share of land oh that's I wouldn't rely on share of lambs li you needed to take that out in these votes from Washington completely failed to do that and that leaves Taccone with you know look again yeah legally is he gonna try to pursue some kind of recount here we'll see the Republicans want him to try to do that we'll see something absolutely crazy I suppose could happen with these few outstanding you know provisional ballots or whatever but honestly this is the thing this is the thing we were waiting for we waited all night to see could rick Ciccone beat that trend we'd been seeing and really get a big number out of Washington the absentee ballots he completely did not do that in so Connor Lam is the apparent winner hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
