I think all around Canada is very lucky to have Justin Trudeau as their prime minister this is one of the best Prime Minister's Canada I've had and I've been living here for 20 years hey there you go here is a loonie for you sir now we're asking people about Justin Trudeau's India trip and how he's wearing you know very know nothing about it you know nothing about it get my loonie back well that was quite the haberdashery Justin Trudeau was wearing on his whiz-bang trip to India the sort of clothing one would wear at an Indian wedding or if one were starring in a Bollywood film in fact one commentator remarked that Justin Trudeau's clothing was too Indian for Indians that being said what do members of generation Trudeau after-dark have to say about the Prime Minister's latest wardrobe malfunction let's find out no we're just asking people sir what they think about our Prime Minister's clothing choices on his trip to India I feel like Justin Trudeau he knows what he's doing and I feel like his clothing choices are strong enough as it is I post a statement nowhere remember what country goes I feel like even though he goes to India like he's still represented Canadian culture and I feel like at that point like he's just representing Canada you know like well I'm I'm Indian myself this is fantastic what do you think about it then I think he was just trying to you know show appreciation I don't think he was appropriating at all yeah I mean I see how people thought that and I think they were just like personally I think they were just making a bigger deal out of it than they should've let me just say this Justin Trudeau even as a person is magnificent and the fact what makes a magnificent sir his views on everything whether it's political social or anything else I just agree with him 100% and the fact that he dressed the way he did um just shows respect he was just trying to show respect to the people who were from India do you think he was like overdoing it I mean it's kind of if Indian Prime Minister Modi came to Canada and he dressed up as a Mountie or a lumberjack he owned he was walking around going how's it goin eh don't you think that would bring ridicule in this country I mean it's apples and oranges you you don't you don't see the same sort of moves pulled on by like those kind of people so like Modi coming to Canada is very different than Trudeau going to India and with Trudeau's agenda I see why he did that and it like what is his agenda in dressing this way trying to portray inclusivity way more than his predecessors which is fine but he seemed to be wearing clothing that's very formal even by Indian Sanders things you wear to an Indian wedding or if you're in a Bollywood film and you know there's been a lot of ridicule about it but you think it's a good choice what he's been wearing no I feel like he's embracing the culture and I feel like at that point he's just trying to it's created the closer's I'm gonna make everybody feel like it's the first real society you know like at that point everybody it's Greece the Canadian culture was his idea you know now that kind of clothing is pretty expensive it's undoubtedly being charged with the taxpayer is that a good idea - I feel like he should just be himself right I feel like he should go to these business trips and just wear what he would normally wear and not try to suck up to like whatever country he's going to you okay okay like Justin Georgia Oh what do you like about him sir he's a good guy like he's so friendly like his election it respects all there are like different cultures per honestly Justin Trudeau's pretty dope guy bro like no matter what he wears he's pretty good-looking guy yeah you say you say dope that's doping a good sense or he is a dope and a good sense it's like probably the best-looking Prime Minister like like no homo like the best-looking Prime Minister of all time a lot of people are saying he's kind of going over the top of it it's very like Bollywood ish and Indian formal wedding where kind of thing but if he's celebrating a tradition that like where is that - where why would you not wear it why would you be like I'm gonna wear pants and your culture you wouldn't do that you wouldn't so that's not over the top it's not over the top if he went to say Scotland would you want him to wear a kilt to be Gozer if he wanted to the Prime Minister of India mr. Modi if he came to Canada and he wore like a lumberjack outfit or a Mountie uniform you know what do you think that would be applauded or would it be mocked I think in the city of Toronto I mean like it would be one of those things where it's like you know I kind of applied these kind of I accept these kind of alternative you know point of views from these other kind of but the seems to be a good thing if he did that it would maybe be good fame but you sought to look out for the residents of the on you know Ontario in Canada large mr. Modi would have to do that well I don't know man like III really don't want to see anything you know specific about a certain individual I mean that would be politically you know not in favor of my position right now but what is your position by the way in terms of Indian haberdashery you know if you look back at the history of it the you know Aboriginal Indian it's kind of very touchy subject hey folks if you like that report please become a premium subscriber and never miss another revel video
