1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
“The United States, like
many other countries,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,720
suffers from a lack of trust.”

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,910
Rob Porter was a high-
ranking White House

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,880
aide with a low public profile.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,700
He was the man responsible for
managing all documents that

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,880
were seen by the president.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,430
But unlike some
people Donald Trump

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,960
brought to the
White House, Porter

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,880
was no stranger to
Washington politics.

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,980
“One of the president’s
most trusted advisers.”

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,570
“She says he choked her.”

12
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,570
“He says he’s innocent.”

13
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,570
Porter was
forced to resign after his two

14
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,700
ex-wives came forward
with allegations

15
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,840
of domestic violence.

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,610
“Rob followed me to the
shower and pulled me out

17
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,010
of the shower to
continue the rage.”

18
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,220
Former classmates and
colleagues described

19
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,070
Porter as confident and capable,
but others described his behavior

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,470
as cocky and overly ambitious.

21
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,650
He served as chief of staff
for Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah

22
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,690
for over two years.

23
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,060
The clean-cut Republican
went to Harvard Law School

24
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,770
and was a Rhodes scholar.

25
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,970
“Indeed, in these three areas
the facts of the campaign

26
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,662
point to George W. Bush as
the clear and essential choice

27
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,120
for president of
the United States.”

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,660
His father was a former aide
to President George H.W. Bush

29
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,260
and is a professor at
Harvard.

30
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,570
While in law school,

31
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,990
Porter took two years off to go
on a Mormon mission in London.

32
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,090
Both of Porter’s
ex-wives have spoken out

33
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,820
about the Mormon church’s 
role in their relationships.

34
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,220
Jennifer Willoughby said

35
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,250
Recently, The
Daily Mail reported

36
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,650
that Porter was in a
relationship with Hope Hicks

37
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,240
the White House communications
director.

38
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,350
Porter was a rising star 
in Washington politics.

39
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,930
His abrupt exit puts
another unwanted spotlight

40
00:01:36,930 --> 00:00:00,000
on the White House.
