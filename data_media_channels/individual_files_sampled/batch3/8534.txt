ADDRESSED. TECHNICALLY CONCLUDED WITH A TRUCE AND NEVER REPLACED BY A FORMAL PEACE TREATY. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. RETIRED FOUR-STAR GENERAL JACK KEANE. GOOD TO HAVE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU. Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN TONIGHT. MONTHS AGO, THEY WERE CARRYING OUT BALLISTIC MISSILE TESTS. NUCLEAR TESTS. YOU'VE BEEN ONE OF THE ONCE, NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I ASKED, YOU THOUGHT THIS MEETING WOULD COME TO FRUITION. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR. I THINK WE ARE GETTING OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT. KIM JONG UN REQUESTED THE ONE-ON-ONE MEETING. INTERPRETERS ONLY. I THINK HE REALLY WANTED TO GET A FEEL FOR THE PRESIDENT AND GET HIMSELF COMFORTABLE. SAVING FACE IS A MAJOR ISSUE. I DON'T THINK HE WANTED TO SHOW ANY DISCOMFORT IN FRONT OF HIS OWN ADVISORS AND THAT'S WHY HE WANTED THE ONE-ON-ONE MEETING. NOT SO MUCH TO ACCOMPLISH MAJOR SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES BUT TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER. WHAT I THINK IS HAPPENING HERE IS KIM JONG UN'S ADVISORS AND KIM JONG UN HIMSELF HAS ALREADY TOLD SECRETARY POMPEO HE IS WANTING TO DENUCLEARIZE. THE PROOF OF THAT AND I THINK THAT'S WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SHOWN SOME OPTIMISM ABOUT THE SUMMIT THAT'S UNDERWAY. THE REAL ISSUE WILL BE HOW DO WE TELL IF THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO COME TO PASS? HERE'S HOW. WE INTO A DISCUSSION. YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY AND LOCATE FOR US YOUR NUCLEAR ARSENAL. I MEAN THEY HAVE TEN TO 20 WEAPONS. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE ALL OF THEM ARE. THEY HAVE TO IDENTIFY AND LOCATE WHERE THOSE WERE BIZARRE, WHERE THE FUEL SITES ARE FOR THE WEAPONS, FOR THE RESEARCH SITES ARE, THE STORAGE SITES. THEY'VE GOT 70 TO 80 BALLISTIC MISSILES. WE KNOW WHERE MOST OF THEM ARE BUT NOT FOR ALL OF THEM ARE. THEY HAVE TO IDENTIFY AND LOCATE THAT THROUGH US. THAT'S WHEN YOU START TO SEE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IF THEY ARE WILLING TO COME FORWARD WITH THAT INFORMATION WHICH IS AFTER ALL THEIR MOST SECRET AND GUARDED INFORMATION. Shannon: WHAT THEY FEEL GUARANTEES THE SAFETY OF THEIR REGIME. YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD DEAL FOR THEM. I WANT TO REDO SOMETHING FROM A COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY LAW PROFESSOR. IN THE "LOS ANGELES TIMES" HE SAYS "IF YOU SIGN A PEACE TREATY WITHOUT DENUCLEARIZATION, YOU WERE GIVING DE FACTO RECOGNITION TO NORTH KOREA AS A NUCLEAR STATE. YOU ARE GIVING NORTH KOREA EXACTLY WHAT IT WANTS AND PERPETUATING THE PROBLEM." WE HAVE DISCUSSED, ONE OF THE MAIN GOALS THE CONVERSATION. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. WHAT COULD LIKELY HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THIS SUMMIT IS TO BEGIN THE PROCESS THAT WOULD LEAD TO ENDING THE KOREAN WAR AND THE ARMISTICE WHICH LEADS ALSO TO A PEACE TREATY. IN OTHER WORDS, WE COMMIT TO THE PROCESS. WE DON'T COMMIT TO THE END STATE. BUT ABSOLUTELY THE INTERMEDIATE OBJECTIVE THAT HAS TO BE ACHIEVED BEFORE ANY PEACE TREATY IS BROUGHT FOR RATIFICATION IS THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA. THAT'S AN ABSOLUTE IMPERATIVE. THE TRUMP TEAM IS VERY COGNIZANT OF THAT FACT. THEY WILL NOT TRADE AWAY A PEACE TREATY AND ENDING THE WAR PRIOR TO DENUCLEARIZATION. WHAT THEY WILL DO IS COMMIT TO THE PROCESS. THE OTHER THING THEY CAN COMMIT TO IS A PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION WITH NORTH KOREA. SO WE CAN EXCHANGE LIAISON OFFICERS ET CETERA. THAT'S JUST A PROCESS. THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED AT THE SUMMIT THAT PUTS IN MOTION WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE FOR THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS DENUCLEARIZATION THAT'S COMPLETE AND ALSO VERIFIABLE. IF THEY START TO COMMIT FOR IDENTIFICATION AND LOCATION AND THEN THE NEXT QUESTION I'M SURE SECRETARY POMPEO PUT ON THE TABLE IS WE NEED TO VERIFY IT. WE WANT U.S. INSPECTORS INVOLVED. WE'RE WILLING TO HAVE OTHER INDEPENDENT INSPECTORS. WERE NOT GOING TO TURN INTO THE IAEA AS HAS BEEN DOWN IN THE PAST. THEY HAVE MADE FALSE CLAIMS. THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT HAS TO DROP. Shannon: WE KNOW THEY HAVE HAD MANY OTHER AGREEMENTS OVER NUMEROUS ADMINISTRATIONS AND THEY'VE ENDED WITH A MISSILE TEST OR SOME OTHER TEST NORTH KOREA HAD AGREED THEY WEREN'T GOING TO DO. WE KNOW IT'S A DETAILED, TEDIOUS PROCESS. THIS ADMINISTRATION AND PRESIDENT TRUMP PROBABLY WANTING A MORE EXPEDITED TIMETABLE ON THE DENUCLEARIZATION THAT WHAT KIM JONG UN WOULD AGREE TO. WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW THEY
