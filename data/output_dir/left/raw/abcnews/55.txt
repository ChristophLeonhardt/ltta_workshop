CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND ULTIMATELY

12

MOVE THE EMBASSY THERE.

13
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:42,008
IT'S A CONTROVERSIAL DECISION 

14
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,677
FROM PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THE 

15
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,646
STATUS SHOULD BE HANDLED IN 

16
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:47,113
PEACE TALKS.

17
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,215
MANY U.S. PRESIDENTS PROMISED TO

18
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,083
MAKE THIS MOVE.

19
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,450
PRESIDENT TRUMP THE FIRST TO 

20
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,051

25
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:07,266
HE LEARNED YOU CAN'T SNAP YOUR 

26
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:08,902
FINGER AND MOVE AN EMBASSY.

27
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,672
HE'S BEEN UNDER I AM MENS 

28
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,174
PRESSURE TO MAKE THIS MOVE.

29
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,543
IF THE EMBASSY DOESN'T OPEN ANY 

30
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,144
TIME SOON -- IT'S EXPECTED TO 

31
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:20,513
TAKE YEARS.

32
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,114
THIS WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO 

33
00:01:22,114 --> 00:01:26,152
PAINT THIS AS A CAMPAIGN PROMISE

34
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:27,820
FULFILLED PERHAPS AT THE EXPENSE

35
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,954
OF THE PEACE PROCESS. 

36
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:32,158
>> I WANT TO BRING IN MARTHA 

37
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:32,391
RADDATZ.

38
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:36,996
YOU'VE SEEN OUR ALLIES IN EUROPE

39
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:37,396
CONDEMN THIS MOVE.

40
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:39,165
THEY SAY IT'S GOING TO BE 

41
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,499
DANGEROUS AND COMPLICATE THE 

42
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:41,400
PEACE PROCESS. 

43
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,103
>> IT CERTAINLY WILL, GEORGE.

44
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,439
WHATEVER PEACE PROCESS THERE IS,

45
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,475
WHATEVER PEACE NISH TRIF THERE 

46
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:51,910
IS -- OF COURSE JARED KUSHNER 

47
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,978
HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS.

48
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:55,781
I THINK IT'S A SIGNAL THINGS 

49
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:57,217
HAVING BEEN GOING WELL.

50
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,385

>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ENTERING WITH

52
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:03,522
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. 

53
00:02:03,522 --> 00:02:03,957
>> THANK YOU.

54
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,525
WHEN I CAME INTO OFFICE, I 

55
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:10,229
PROMISED TO LOOK AT THE WORLD'S 

56
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,999
CHALLENGES WITH OPEN EYES AND 

57
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,868
VERY FRESH THINKING.

58
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:17,803
WE CANNOT SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS BY 

59
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:20,006
MAKING THE SAME FAILED 

60
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,641
ASSUMPTIONS AND REPEATING THE 

61
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,011
SAME FAILED STRATEGIES OF THE 

62
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:25,211
PAST.

63
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,715
OLD CHALLENGES DEMAND NEW 

64
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:29,349
APPROACHES.

65
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,317
MY ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY MARKS THE 

66
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,754
BEGINNING OF A NEW APPROACH TO 

67
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,423
CONFLICT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE 

68
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:41,060
PALESTINIANS.

69
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,927
IN 1995 CONGRESS ADOPTED THE 

70
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:44,931
JERUSALEM EMBASSY ACT URGING THE

71
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,866
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RELOCATE 

72
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,535
THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO 

73
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:53,906
JERUSALEM AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT 

74
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:58,011
THAT CITY AND SO IMPORTANTLY IS 

75
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,046
ISRAEL'S CAPITAL.

76
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,182
THIS ACT PASSED CONGRESS BY AN 

77
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,518
OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN MAJORITY

78
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:09,755
AND WAS REAFFIRMED BY UNANIMOUS 

79
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:12,258
VOTE OF THE SENATOR, ONLY SIX 

80
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,159
MONTHS AGO.

81
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,930
YET FOR OVER 20 YEARS EVERY 

82
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,266
PREVIOUS AMERICAN PRESIDENT HAS 

83
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,002
EXERCISED THE LAWS WAIVER 

84
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,571
REFUSING TO MOVE THE U.S. 

85
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:29,408
EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM OR TO 

86
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,578
RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM AS ISRAEL'S 

87
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:33,479
CAPITAL CITY.

88
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,448
PRESIDENTS ISSUED THESE WAIVERS 

89
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,184
UNDER THE BELIEF THAT DELAYING 

90
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,618
THE RECOGNITION OF JERUSALEM 

91
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:42,288
WOULD ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF 

92
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:42,622
PEACE.

93
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,124
SOME SAY THEY LACKED COURAGE, 

94
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,059
BUT THEY MADE THEIR BEST 

95
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:49,995
JUDGMENT BASED ON FACTS AS THEY 

96
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:53,299
UNDERSTOOD THEM AT THE TIME.

97
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,835
NEVERTHELESS THE RECORD IS IN.

98
00:03:55,835 --> 00:04:00,072
AFTER MORE THAN TWO DECADES OF 

99
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:03,075
WAIVERS WE ARE NO CLOSER TO A 

100
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:04,443
LASTING PEACE AGREEMENT BETWEEN 

101
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:08,247
ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS.

102
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:10,549
IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO ASSUME 

103
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:12,751
REPEATING THE EXACT SAME FORMULA

104
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:15,688
WOULD NOW PRODUCE A DIFFERENT OR

105
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:16,088
BETTER RESULT.

106
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:19,257
THEREFORE I HAVE DETERMINED THAT

107
00:04:19,257 --> 00:04:22,762
IT IS TIME TO OFFICIALLY 

108
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,399
RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM AS THE 

109
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,601
CAPITAL OF ISRAEL.

110
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,271
WHILE PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS HAVE 

111
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:34,440
MADE THIS A MAJOR CAMPAIGN 

112
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,310
PROMISE, THEY FAILED TO DELIVER.

113
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,480
TODAY I AM DELIVERING.

114
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,814
I'VE JUDGED THIS COURSE OF 

115
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:46,051
ACTION TO BE IN THE BEST 

116
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:49,422
INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES 

117
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,657
AND THE PURSUIT OF PEACE BETWEEN

118
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:53,226
ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS.

119
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,861
THIS IS A LONG OVERDUE STEP TO 

120
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:57,830
ADVANCE THE PEACE PROCESS AND TO

121
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,401
WORK TOWARDS A LASTING 

122
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:01,668
AGREEMENT.

123
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,969
ISRAEL IS A SOVEREIGN NATION 

124
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:08,140
WITH THE RIGHT LIKE EVERY OTHER 

125
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,675
SOVEREIGN NATION TO DETERMINE 

126
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:11,277
ITS OWN CAPITAL.

127
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:14,079
ACKNOWLEDGING THIS AS A FACT IS 

128
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,482
A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR 

129
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,684
ACHIEVING PEACE.

130
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:22,021
IT WAS 70 YEARS AGO THAT THE 

131
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:26,225
UNITED STATES UNDER PRESIDENT 

132
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,461
TRUEMAN RECOGNIZED THE STATE OF 

133
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,362
ISRAEL.

134
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,996
EVER SINCE THAT ISRAEL HAS MADE 

135
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:33,065
ITS CAPITAL IN THE CITY OF 

136
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:34,100
JERUSALEM.

137
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,371
THE CAPITAL THE JEWISH PEOPLE 

138
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:44,076
ESTABLISHED IN ANCIENT TIMES.

139
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:46,412
TODAY IT IS THE SEAT OF THE 

140
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,147
MODERN ISRAELRY GOVERNMENT.

141
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,950
IT'S THE HOME OF THE ISRAELRY 

142
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,320
PARLIAMENT AS WELL AS THE 

143
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,622
ISRAELRY SUPREME COURT.

144
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,857
IT'S THE LOCATION OF THE 

145
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,824
OFFICIAL RESIDENCE OF THE PRIME 

146
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:01,928
MEN AND THE PRESIDENT.

147
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,630
IT IS THE HEAD QUARTERS OF MANY 

148
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,132
GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES.

149
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,568
FOR DECADES VISITING AMERICAN 

150
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,003
PRESIDENTS, SECRETARIES OF STATE

151
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:14,573
AND MILITARY LEADERS HAVE MET 

152
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:18,410
THEIR ISRAELI COUNTER PARTS IN 

153
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,449
JERUSALEM AS I DID ON MY TRIP TO

154
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,351
ISRAEL EARLIER THIS YEAR.

155
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,219
JERUSALEM IS NOT JUST THE HEART 

156
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,887
OF THREE GREAT RELIGIONS.

157
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:31,057
IT'S NOW ALSO THE HEART OF ONE 

158
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,192
OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL 

159
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,827
DEMOCRACIES IN THE WORLD.

160
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:39,265
OVER THE PAST SEVEN DECADES THE 

161
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:44,403
ISRAELI PEOPLE HAVE BUILT A 

162
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:53,012
COUNTRY WHERE JEWS, MUSLIMS AND 

163
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,380
CHRISTIANS CAN WORSHIP ACCORDING

164
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,315
TO THEIR CUSTOMS AND BELIEFS.

165
00:06:56,315 --> 00:07:00,186
JERUSALEM IS TODAY AND MUST 

166
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,287
REMAIN A PLACE WHERE JEWS PRAY 

167
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:03,723
AT THE WESTERN WALL.

168
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,658
WHERE CHRISTIANS WALK THE 

169
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:09,695
STATIONS OF THE CROSS AND WHERE 

170
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:13,999
MUSLIMS WORSHIP AT THEIR MOSQUE.

171
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,568
HOWEVER THROUGH ALL OF THESE 

172
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:20,706
YEARS PRESIDENTS REPRESENTING 

173
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,008
THE UNITED STATES HAVE DID HE 

174
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:22,575
CLI 

175
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,077
DECLINED TO OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZE

176
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,280
JERUSALEM AS ISRAEL'S CAPITAL.

177
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,316
IN FACT, WE HAVE DECLINED TO 

178
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,451
ACKNOWLEDGE ANY ISRAELI CAPITAL 

179
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:33,653
AT ALL.

180
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,122
TODAY WE FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE

181
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,890
OBVIOUS, THAT JERUSALEM IS 

182
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,559
ISRAEL'S CAPITAL.

183
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,694
THIS IS NOTHING MORE OR LESS 

184
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:47,466
THAN A RECOGNITION OF REALITY.

185
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,602
IT IS ALSO THE RIGHT THING TO 

186
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:49,768
DO.

187
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:53,172
IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE 

188
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:53,372
DONE.

189
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,642
THAT IS WHY CONSISTENT WITH THE 

190
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,478
JERUSALEM EMBASSY ACT I AM ALSO 

191
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:00,846
DIRECTING THE STATE DEPARTMENT 

192
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:03,416
TO BEGIN PREPARATION TO MOVE THE

193
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,319
AMERICAN EMBASSY FROM TEL AVIV 

194
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,154
TO JERUSALEM.

195
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,255
THIS WILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THE 

196
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:13,625
PROCESS OF HIRING ARCHITECTS, 

197
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,661
ENGINEERS AND PLANNERS SO THAT A

198
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:20,733
NEW EMBASSY, WHEN COMPLETED, 

199
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,668
WILL BE A MAGNIFICENT TRIBUTE TO

200
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:22,901
PEACE. 

201
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:24,903
>> IN MAKING THESE ANNOUNCEMENTS

202
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:28,474
I ALSO WANT TO MAKE ONE POINT 

203
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,275
VERY CLEAR.

204
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,443
THIS DECISION IS NOT INTENDED IN

205
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:34,078
ANY WAY TO REFLECT A DEPARTURE 

206
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:36,515
FROM OUR STRONG COMMITMENT TO 

207
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:39,118
FACILITATE A LASTING PEACE 

208
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:39,418
AGREEMENT.

209
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,720
WE WANT AN AGREEMENT THAT IS A 

210
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,723
GREAT DEAL FOR THE ISRAELIS AND 

211
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:48,060
A GREAT DEAL FOR THE 

212
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,393
PALESTINIANS.

213
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:50,763
WE ARE NOT TAKING A POSITION OF 

214
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,966
ANY FINAL STATUS ISSUES, 

215
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,734
INCLUDING THE SPECIFIC 

216
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:58,103
BOUNDARIES OF THE ISRAELI 

217
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:00,472
SOVEREIGNTY IN JERUSALEM OR THE 

218
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:03,376
RESOLUTION OF CONTESTED BORDERS.

219
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,012
THOSE QUESTIONS ARE UP TO THE 

220
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,547
PARTIES INVOLVED.

221
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:11,050
THE UNITED STATES REMAINS DEEPLY

222
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,952
COMMITTED TO HELPING FACILITATE 

223
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:17,389
A PEACE AGREEMENT THAT IS 

224
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:21,093
ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES.

225
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,796
I INTEND TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY 

226
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:28,167
POWER TO HELP FORGE SUCH AN 

227
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:28,467
AGREEMENT.

228
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,401
WITHOUT QUESTION JERUSALEM IS 

229
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:31,570
ONE OF THE MOST SENSITIVE ISSUES

230
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,006
IN THOSE TALKS.

231
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,375
THE UNITED STATES WOULD SUPPORT 

232
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:40,312
A TWO-STATE SOLUTION IF AGREED 

233
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:44,784
TO BY BOTH SIDES.

234
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,985
IN THE MEANTIME I CALL ON ALL 

235
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:50,189
PARTIES TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS 

236
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:54,160
QUO AS JERUSALEM'S HOLY SITES 

237
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,830
INCLUDING THE TEMPLE MOUNT.

238
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,432
ABOVE ALL OUR GREATEST HOPE IS 

239
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:01,801
FOR PEACE.

240
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:06,171
THE UNIVERSAL YEARNING IN EVERY 

241
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:06,839
HUMAN SOUL.

242
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:12,845
WITH TODAY'S ACTION, I REAFFIRM 

243
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,413
MY ADMINISTRATION'S 

244
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,048
LONG-STANDING COMMITMENT TO A 

245
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,817
FUTURE OF PEACE AND SECURITY FOR

246
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:18,617
THE REGION.

247
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:23,489
THERE WILL OF COURSE BE 

248
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:27,226
DISAGREEMENT AND DI SENT 

249
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,928
REGARDING THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

250
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,262
WE'RE CONFIDENT AS WE WORK 

251
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,297
THROUGH THESE DISAGREEMENTS 

252
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:36,168
WE'LL ARRIVE AT A PEACE AND A 

253
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,904
PLACE FAR GREATER IN 

254
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,773
UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION.

255
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,407
THIS SACRED CITY SHOULD CALL 

256
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:46,245
FORTH THE BEST IN HUMANITY, 

257
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:49,081
LIFTING OUR SIGHTS TO WHAT IS 

258
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,649
POSSIBLE, NOT PULLING US BACK 

259
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:54,920
AND DOWN TO THE OLD FIGHTS THAT 

260
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,090
HAVE BECOME SO TOTALLY 

261
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,225
PREDICTABLE.

262
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,727
PEACE IS NEVER BEYOND THE GRASP 

263
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,430
OF THOSE WILLING TO REACH IT.

264
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,033
SO TODAY WE CALL FOR CALM, FOR 

265
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:11,103
MODERATION AND FOR THE VOICES OF

266
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,806
TOLERANCE TO PREVAIL OVER THE 

267
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,809
PURVEY ORS OF HATE.

268
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,578
OUR CHILDREN SHOULD INHERIT OUR 

269
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,947
LOVE, NOT OUR CONFLICTS.

270
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,850
I REPEAT THE MESSAGE I DELIVERED

271
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,819
AT THE HISTORIC AND 

272
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:35,027
EXTRAORDINARY SUMMIT IN SAUDI 

273
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,730
ARABIA EARLIER THIS YEAR.

274
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,165
ITS PEOPLE ARE BRILLIANT PROUD 

275
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:43,135
ANDY VERSE, VIBRANT AND STRONG.

276
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,571
THE INCREDIBLE FUTURE AWAITING 

277
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:53,946
THIS REGION IS HELD AT BAY BY 

278
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:59,351
BLOOD SHED, IGNORANCE AND 

279
00:11:59,351 --> 00:11:59,584
TERROR.

280
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:00,252
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE WILL 

281
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:04,156
TRAVEL TO THE REGION TO REPEAT 

282
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,626
OUR COMMITMENT TO DEFEAT THE 

283
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,128
RADICALISM THAT DASHES THE HOPES

284
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,296
AND DREAMS OF FUTURE 

285
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:11,697
GENERATIONS.

286
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,799
IT IS TIME FOR THE MANY WHO 

287
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:18,136
DESIRE PEACE TO EXPEL THE 

288
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:22,174
EXTREMISTS FROM THEIR MIDSTS.

289
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,776
IT IS TIME FOR ALL SIF LIEZED 

290
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:27,313
NATIONS AND PEOPLE TO RESPOND TO

291
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,148
DISAGREEMENT WITH REASONABLE 

292
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:32,284
DEBATE, NOT VIOLENCE.

293
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,386
IT IS TIME FOR YOUNG AND 

294
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:40,025
MODERATE VOICES ALL ACROSS THE 

295
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:43,095

297

BEAUTIFUL FUTURE.

298

TODAY LET US REDEDICATE 

299
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,270
OURSELVES TO A PATH OF MUTUAL 

300
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,638
UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT.

301
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:56,208
LET US RETHINK OLD ASSUMPTIONS 

302
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,345
AND OPEN OUR HEARTS AND MINDS TO

303
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,780
POSSIBLE AND POSSIBILITIES.

304
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,917
FINALLY I ASK THE LEADERS OF THE

305

REMARKS ASKING FOR PEACE AND 

318
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:37,683
CALM.

319
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,652
AFTER PLACING HIM IN THE 

320
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,453
TRADITION OF HARRY TRUEMAN THE 

321
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,988
FIRST U.S. PRESIDENT TO

00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,089
RECOGNIZE ISRAEL.

323
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,223
PRESIDENT TRUMP BECOMING THE 

324
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:47,125
FIRST AMERICAN PRESIDENT TO 

325
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,061
RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM THE CAPITAL 

326
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:50,328
OF ISRAEL.

327
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:52,665
PUTTING HIS SIGNATURES ON THE 

328
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:52,898
PAGINGS.

329
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,801
HE SAYS AFTER PLANNING HE'LL 

330
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,670
MOVE THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY 

331
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,206
FROM TEL AVIV TO JERUSALEM.

332
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:02,207
THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAYS THIS IS 

333
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:04,742
A RECOGNITION OF REALITY.

334
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:06,011
JERUSALEM IS THE CAPITAL OF 

335
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:06,244
ISRAEL.

336
00:14:06,244 --> 00:14:07,746
HE'S SAYING IT'S ALSO THE RIGHT 

337
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:08,747
THING TO DO.

338
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,716
WHERE IT MIGHT NOT BE A 

339
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,985
RECOGNITION OF REALITY IS HIS 

340
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,320
POINT THIS DOES NOT SIGNAL A 

341
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,489
DEPARTURE FRFT PEACE PROCESS. 

342
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,458
>> THAT'S NOT HOW OUR ALLIES IN 

343
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,427
THE ARAB WORLD SEE IT. 

344
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:24,163
>> AND ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

345
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,465
NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS 

346
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,901
THEIR EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM.

347
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,003
NOW THE UNITED STATES WILL IF 

348
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:31,870
THIS CONTINUES.

349
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,972
ASK YOURSELF WHY.

350
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,641
THE REASON IS BECAUSE EVERY 

351
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,242
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS 

352
00:14:37,242 --> 00:14:38,810
RECOGNIZED HOW DANGEROUS, HOW 

353
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,779
INTENTIONALLY EMOTIONAL, HOW 

354
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,214
PROFOUND AN ISSUE THIS IS.

355
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,149
SACRED GROUND FOR THREE OF THE 

356
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,085
WORLD'S MAJOR RELIGIONS.

357
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,786
NOT ONLY DOES THIS PUT THE 

358
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,621
UNITED STATES OUT OF STEP WITH 

359
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:53,959
ARAB ALLIES AND EUROPEAN ALLIES 

360
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,294
IT PUTS US OUT OF STEP WITH 

361
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:57,629
LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD.

362
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:01,266
IT NULL FIES THE POSSIBILITY OF 

363
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:02,234
NEGOTIATION ON THIS PROCESS.

364
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,170
HE SAYS THAT HE'S STILL OPEN TO 

365
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,374
A TWO-STATE SOLUTION.

366
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,441
PALESTINIANS WHO ALSO BELIEVE 

367
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,309
THAT JERUSALEM IS THEIR CAPITAL 

368
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:12,411
NOW FEEL THAT CONVERSATION HAS 

369
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,679
BEEN CLOSED.

370
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,414
THE UNITED STATES REALLY GOT 

371
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:19,118
NOTHING FORGIVING AWAY THIS 

372
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,319
CONCESSION IN THESE 

373
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,153
NEGOTIATIONS.

374
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,354
IT'S A UNILATERAL STEP OUT OF 

375
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,156
STEP WITH COUNTRIES AROUND THE 

376
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:24,389
WORLD. 

377
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:26,191
>> IT WAS A FULL THROATED 

378
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,358
ARTICULATION OF THE ISRAELI 

379
00:15:27,358 --> 00:15:27,826
POSITION.

380
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,996
I WANT TO BRING IN JON KARL.

381
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,098
THERE'S A LITTLE AN LOG TO THE 

382
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,468
PRESIDENT'S APPROACH TO DOMESTIC

383
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:36,735
POLITICS. 

384
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,838
>> STRONG SUPPORTER OF ISRAEL, 

385
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,674
STRONG SUPPORTER OF BENJAMIN 

386
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:43,175
NETANYAHU. 

387
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,078
>> FOCUSING ON KEEPING WHAT WAS 

388
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,212
A CORE CAMPAIGN PROMISE.

389
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:50,749
HE PROMISED LIKE MANY REPUBLICAN

390
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,484
CANADA DATDS IN THE PAST HE 

391
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,152
PROMISED HE WOULD RECOGNIZE 

392
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:55,520
JERUSALEM AS THE CAPITAL.

393
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,989
HE PROMISED HE WOULD MOVE THE 

394
00:15:57,989 --> 00:15:59,825
U.S. EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM.

395
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,960
HE DID HOLD BACK A LITTLE BIT.

396
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,829
HE SAID HE'LL BEGIN THE PROCESS 

397
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,630
OF STUDYING AN MOVING TOWARDS 

398
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,066
MOVING THE EMBASSY.

399
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,600
IF HE WANTED TO GO FURTHER HE 

400
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,568
COULD HAVE.

401
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,370
THERE IS A U.S. KONS LATE IN 

402
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:11,637
JERUSALEM.

403
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,107
THAT COULD BE IMMEDIATELY CHRIS 

404
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,776
EVENED AS THE EMBASSY.

405
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,144
HE STOPPED SHORT OF THAT.

406
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,545
THERE IS STILL NEGOTIATION ON 

407
00:16:20,545 --> 00:16:21,680
THIS POINT BECAUSE THE WHITE 

408
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,648
HOUSE IS NOT RULING OUT THE 

409
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:24,983
POSSIBILITY OF A PALESTINIAN 

410
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:27,018
STATE HAVING ITS CAPITAL IN 

411
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:30,755
JERUSALEM AS WELL, HAVING ITS 

412
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:32,191
CAPITAL IN EAST JERUSALEM.

413
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,826
IT'S NOT AS FAR AS HE COULD HAVE

414
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:35,026
GONE.

415
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:37,429
THE WHITE HOUSE IS TRYING TO SAY

416
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,331
THEY'RE LEAFING OPEN THE PEACE 

417
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:39,765
PROCESS. 

418
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,399
>> THEY'RE SAYING IT COULD TAKE 

419
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,336
YEARS TO MOVE THE EMBASSY.

420
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,972
LET ME BRING BACK MARTHA 

421
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:47,239
RADDATZ.

422
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,209
HE SAID OLD CHALLENGES NEED NEW 

423
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:50,709
APPROACHES.

424
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,179
WHAT WE DIDN'T HEAR IS ANY 

425
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,780
'NUANCE YAGS WHAT THAT APPROACH 

426
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,582
MIGHT LOOK LIKE. 

427
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,217
>> EXACTLY GEORGE.

428
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,951
BASICALLY HE LEFT IT AS IF IT'S 

429
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:02,154
THE ONLY REASON WE DIDN'T HAVE A

430
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,856
PEACE AGREEMENT BEFORE BY 

431
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:06,458
DECLARING JERUSALEM THE CAPITAL.

432
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,227
ALSO HAVE TO SAY IT'S A BIG 

433
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,060
WORLD OUT THERE.

434
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,396
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT DOMESTIC 

435
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:12,731
POLITICS.

436
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,833
WE'RE AT A PLACE IN THE WORLD 

437
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,067
WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY 

438
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:17,869
CONFLICTS STILL ONGOING.

439
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:20,839
LOOK AT IRAQ.

440
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,906
WE'RE TRYING TO STABILIZE IRAQ.

441
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:22,574
LOOK AT NORTH KOREA.

442
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:25,143
A LOT OF PEOPLE, A LOT OF 

443
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:28,880
ALLIES, A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE 

444
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,116
ARAB WORLD ARE SAYING WHY NOW?

445
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,150
WHY THROW FLAMES. 

446
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,886
>> WE WANT TO GO TO JAMES 

447
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:37,089
LONGMAN IN THE REGION.

448
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,590
JAMES, THE PRESIDENT CALLED FOR 

449
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,826
CALM IN THAT STATEMENT AS WELL.

450
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:45,464
THIS IS A TENSE REGION NOW. 

451
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,199
>> GEORGE, IT ABSOLUTELY IS.

452
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,601
WHAT PEOPLE WILL BE LOOKING FOR 

453
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:53,071
THE CLARITY T. DONALD TRUMP MADE

454
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,673
NO MENTION OF THE WORDS EAST OR 

455
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:55,174
WEST.

456
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,508
HE SAID ISRAEL SHOULD HAVE A 

457
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,877
CAPITAL CITY AND THAT SHOULD BE 

458
00:17:58,877 --> 00:17:59,378
JERUSALEM.

459
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,613
PALESTINIANS WILL BE LOOKING FOR

460
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:01,846
CLARITY.

461
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:03,114
MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY 

462
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:03,982
BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP WOULD MAKE 

463
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,617
THIS SORT OF STATEMENT.

464
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,653
THERE WAS SOME DISBELIEF HERE.

465
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:11,156
AS THE REALIZATION STARTS TO 

466
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,359
SINK IN -- DON'T UNDERESTIMATE 

467
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,527
THE SYMBOLISM.

468
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,962
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING THIS FOR 

469
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,763
THE FIRST TIME, THE UNITED 

470
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,432
STATES SAYING SOMETHING LIKE 

471
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,468
THIS, THAT KIND OF SYMBOLISM TO 

472
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:24,970
THE EAST COULD MEAN TROUBLE.

473
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,037
FOR THE MOMENT PALESTINIANS 

474
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:27,072
TAKING IT IN.

475
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,907
I THINK IT COULD MEAN TROUBLE AS

476
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:33,645
THE WEEK GOES ON. 

477
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,748
>> LET ME GO BACK TO IS HE 

478
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:40,018
CECILIA VEGA.

479
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,486
JARED KUSHNER HAS BEEN THE POINT

480
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:44,990
PERSON ON THIS, BUT HE JUST SAID

481
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,958
HE WAS SENDING THE VICE 

482
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,258
PRESIDENT. 

483
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:49,161
>> YES.

484
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:53,632
VERY PROM DANTLY DISPLAYED 

485
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,167
BEHIND PRESIDENT TRUMP.

486
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,937
PERHAPS A NOD TO THE 

487
00:18:58,937 --> 00:18:59,270
EVANGELICALS.

488
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,107
HE HAS FACED A LOT OF PRESSURE 

489
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:11,182
FROM PRO ISRAEL GROUPS 

490
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:13,418
PARTICULARING SHELDON, A HUGE 

491
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:13,885
DONOR.

492
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:14,686
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THAT WAS 

493
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:15,620
PART OF THE PRESSURE THIS 

494
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,622
PRESIDENT FACED.

495
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,724
HE HAS TO SIGN THE WAIVER AGAIN.

496
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:19,858
HE DIDN'T WANT TO SIGN IT 

497
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,793
WITHOUT LOOKING LIKE HE WASN'T 

498
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:22,794
FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THE 

499
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,663
CAMPAIGN PROMISE.

500
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,897
IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN GEORGE 

501
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:28,199
GOING FORWARD WHAT WILL HAPPEN 

502
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:28,967
WITH THIS.

503
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,969
THERE ARE NO PLANS TO BUILD THE 

504
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:31,470
EMBASSY.

505
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,738
WE'LL SEE WHETHER IT HAPPENS 

506
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:35,373
UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP TENURE OR 

507
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:35,974
SOMEONE ELSE. 

508
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,010
>> DRAMATIC MOVE FROM PRESIDENT 

509
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,210
TRUMP.

510
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,313
