00:00:09,953 --> 00:00:11,588
PETE: WELL, A HISTORIC MOVE IN

4
00:00:11,588 --> 00:00:14,357
IRELAND AS THE COUNTRY VOTED TO

5
00:00:14,357 --> 00:00:15,925
REPEAL A LAW BANNING ABORTION.

6
00:00:15,925 --> 00:00:16,926
SOME IN THE U.S. MEDIA MARKING

7
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:17,460
THIS AS A VICTORY.

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,329
LISTEN.

9
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:22,232
>> IN IRELAND, A ALLOW AND

10
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:23,767
EMPHATIC "YES" AS VOTERS REPEAL

11
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:26,186
A CONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON ABORTION

12
00:00:26,186 --> 00:00:26,436
A CONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON

13
00:00:26,436 --> 00:00:26,836
ABORTION.

14
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:29,572
>> THE FINAL TALLY SHOWING

15
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:30,340
OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR WOMEN'S

16
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,041
REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN THE

17
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:31,708
MOSTLY CATHOLIC COUNTRY.

18
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:33,710
>> THIS VOTE MARKS A DRAMATIC

19
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,578
SHIFT IN WHAT WAS ONCE DESCRIBED

20
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:38,481
AS THE MOST CATHOLIC COUNTRY IN

21
00:00:38,481 --> 00:00:38,848
THE WORLD.

22
00:00:38,848 --> 00:00:41,184
PETE: SO, DOES THIS MOVE MOVE

23
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:42,152
THE CATHOLIC FAITH MORE TO THE

24
00:00:42,152 --> 00:00:44,321
LEFT AS RELIGION BECOMES MORE

25
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:46,256
PROGRESSIVE TO WELCOME MORE

26
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:47,157
PEOPLE IN?

27
00:00:47,157 --> 00:00:49,926
IS THAT A GOOD THING OR SHOULD

28
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:50,994
WE STICK TO THE ORIGINAL TENETS?

29
00:00:50,994 --> 00:00:53,096
THAT IS THE CORE QUESTION HERE,

30
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:54,898
SHOULD RELIGION STAY

31
00:00:54,898 --> 00:00:56,199
CONSERVATIVE TO THE CORE TENETS

32
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:57,150
OR FOLLOW THE PROGRESSIVE TRENDS

33
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,400
OR FOLLOW THE PROGRESSIVE

34
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,901
TRENDS-of-SOCIETY?

35
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:58,702
LET'S BRING IN OUR RELIGIOUS

36
00:00:58,702 --> 00:01:00,570
PANEL TO DISCUSS.

37
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:07,177
DR. MENEZAFRIDI IS A MUSLIM

38
00:01:07,177 --> 00:01:09,879
SCHOLARLY, DR. RAZZ IS THE

39
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:10,914
NATIONAL LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE,

40
00:01:10,914 --> 00:01:14,050
RABBI COOPER IS AN ASSOCIATE

41
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,751
DEAN IS HE SIMON WIESENTHAL

42
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:15,885
CENTER, AND FATHER JONATHAN

43
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:17,120
MORRIS IS A FOX NEWS RELIGION

44
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,520
CONTRIBUTOR.

45
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,388
A GREAT PANEL.  I COULD START IT

46
00:01:18,388 --> 00:01:20,890
OUT THIS WAY.

47
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,327
A MUSLIM SCHOLAR, EVANGELICAL

48
00:01:24,327 --> 00:01:25,895
PASTOR, AND CATHOLIC PIECE ENTER

49
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:27,130
A JAR.

50
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:27,564
BUT I WON'T.

51
00:01:27,564 --> 00:01:28,698
IT WOULD BE THE START OF A GREAT

52
00:01:28,698 --> 00:01:28,998
JOKE.

53
00:01:28,998 --> 00:01:30,266
NO LAUGHING MATTER, A SERIOUS

54
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:30,600
SUBJECT.

55
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,205
FATHER JOHN, I WANT TO START

56
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:35,572
WITH YOU.

57
00:01:35,572 --> 00:01:36,206
IRELAND, A PREDOMINANTLY

58
00:01:36,206 --> 00:01:37,140
CATHOLIC COUNTRY, WHAT IS THIS

59
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,008
VOTE SAYING ABOUT THE CURRENT

60
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:40,276
STATUS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH?

61
00:01:40,276 --> 00:01:42,145
>> WE SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT THE

62
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:43,380
LEADERSHIP OF THE CACHE STOOD UP

63
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,948
AGAINST THE REPEAL OF THIS

64
00:01:44,948 --> 00:01:45,982
AMENDMENT, SO IT WASN'T THAT THE

65
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:47,784
CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS SAID NO,

66
00:01:47,784 --> 00:01:49,119
THIS IS THE DIRECTION WE WANT TO

67
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,920
GO IN.

68
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,625
BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE

69
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,826
AUTHORITY OR THE PERSUASIVENESS

70
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:57,761
SUFFICIENT IN ORDER TO SAY "NO"

71
00:01:57,761 --> 00:02:00,680
TO THIS REPEAL OF THIS AMENDMENT

72
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:00,930
TO THIS REPEAL OF THIS

73
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,297
AMENDMENT.

74
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:04,033
AND SO IT SAYS THAT,

75
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:05,902
UNFORTUNATELY, SOCIETY HAS MOVED

76
00:02:05,902 --> 00:02:07,137
IN THIS DIRECTION SO STRONGLY OF

77
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:08,738
PRO-ABORTION, YOU CALL IT WHAT

78
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:11,207
YOU WANT, YOU COULD SAY NO, IT'S

79
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:13,376
JUST, YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST

80
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:17,180
ALLOWING FREE CHOICE, BUT THE

81
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,381
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ALONE

82
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:19,682
SINCE WE'VE HAD UPWARDS OF 40

83
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:22,285
MILLION ABORTIONS.

84
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:22,886
40 MILLION?

85
00:02:22,886 --> 00:02:25,321
THAT IS A HUGE NUMBER, AND THE

86
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:27,157
FACT THAT IRELAND, A CATHOLIC

87
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:28,425
COUNTRY, A CHRISTIAN COUNTRY IS

88
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:29,659
GOING IN THAT DIRECTION IS

89
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:30,326
NOTHING TO CELEBRATE

90
00:02:30,326 --> 00:02:30,560
NOTHING TO CELEBRATE.

91
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,462
PETE: ABRAHAM, YOU CALL IT A

92
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:32,896
PROTEST VOTE.

93
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:34,063
WHY?

94
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:36,199
>> WELL, I THINK WHAT WE'RE

95
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:39,102
LOOKING AT IN IRELAND IS AN

96
00:02:39,102 --> 00:02:40,603
EMBRACE OF THE, YOU KNOW, EU

97
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:41,504
ENVIRONMENT.

98
00:02:41,504 --> 00:02:43,406
IRELAND'S DONE VERY WELL BY

99
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:45,975
TAKING A LEAD IN THE EUROPEAN

100
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:49,279
UNION.

101
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,013
AND, YOU KNOW, AS AN ORTHODOX

102
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:50,880
RABBI IT'S NOT FOR ME TO COMMENT

103
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,449
ON WHICH A THE CHURCH SHOULD DO,

104
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:53,783
BUT CLEARLY THAT SOCIETY THAT

105
00:02:53,783 --> 00:02:56,286
HAS MADE A MOVE AND NOW YOU HAVE

106
00:02:56,286 --> 00:03:02,025
A CHURCH WHERE IT'S STILL A

107
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:02,725
PREDOMINANT FAITH, THERE'S

108
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:03,460
PREDOMINANT TEACHERS, BUT THERE

109
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,929
HAS TO BE A SHIFT IN TERMS OF

110
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:06,596
PERSUASION RATHER THAN THE

111
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:08,465
STARTING POINT, WELL, THESE ARE

112
00:03:08,465 --> 00:03:10,066
THE RULES, YOU FOLLOW THEM, YOU

113
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:11,835
KNOW, OUR WAY OR OUT THE DOOR.

114
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:14,003
IT IS A PIVOTAL MOMENT.

115
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:15,271
PETE: SAMUEL, PIVOTAL MOMENT

116
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:18,308
OVERALL AS WELL, FROM AN

117
00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:18,975
EVANGELICAL PERSPECTIVE, IS

118
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:20,243
PROGRESSIVISM CREEPING INTO OUR

119
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:20,910
FAITH?

120
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,379
AND IF SO, WHAT IMPACT IS THAT

121
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,582
HAVING ON NOT JUST IRELAND, BUT

122
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:27,450
AMERICA AND THE WORLD AT LARGE?

123
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,821
>> WELL, THE IDEA OF PROGRESSIVE

124
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:33,423
CHRISTIANITY IS OXYMORONIC IN

125
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:35,341
ITS DEPICTION AND ITS EXPRESSION

126
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:35,592
ITS DEPICTION AND ITS

127
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:35,992
EXPRESSION.

128
00:03:35,992 --> 00:03:36,759
YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH PROGRESSIVE

129
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,193
CHRISTIANITY.

130
00:03:37,193 --> 00:03:39,095
LET ME EXPLAIN.

131
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:40,597
CHRISTIANITY IS ABOUT THE GOSPEL

132
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:41,798
THE GO TO SLEEP OF JESUS NEVER

133
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:42,131
CHANGES.

134
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:44,634
IT'S TRUTH, LOVE, GRACE, HOPE,

135
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:46,569
AND FAITH, REGARDLESS OF THE

136
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:48,071
TIME, THE CULTURE, SOCIETY.

137
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:50,907
TRUTH, LOVE, GRACE, AND HOPE

138
00:03:50,907 --> 00:03:51,841
SHOULD NEVER BE SACRIFICED ON

139
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:56,546
THE ALTAR OF POLITICAL, CULTURAL

140
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:57,046
OR SEXUAL EXPEDIENCY

141
00:03:57,046 --> 00:03:57,280
OR SEXUAL EXPEDIENCY.

142
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,617
PETE: ABSOLUTELY.

143
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:01,885
MENAZ, BRIEFLY ON THIS, WHAT

144
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:03,386
DOES ISLAM HAVE TO SAY ABOUT

145
00:04:03,386 --> 00:04:04,954
ABORTION AND LIFE AS IT PERTAINS

146
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,556
NOT JUST TO IRELAND BUT THE

147
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:06,956
WHOLE ISSUE?

148
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,791
>> WELL, ISLAM, LIKE ALL THE

149
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,927
OTHER ABRAHAMIC FAITHS, BELIEVES

150
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:12,128
THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE IS A VALUE

151
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:14,964
OF HUMAN LIFE.

152
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,166
HOWEVER, IT'S ALSO A VERY

153
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,134
PRACTICAL RELIGION WHERE THERE

154
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:20,870
HAVE BEEN CERTAIN LEGAL SCHOLARS

155
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,272
THAT HAVE SAID THAT IF THERE IS

156
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:25,575
A DANGER OF MOTHER'S HEALTH OR

157
00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:27,844
THERE IS SOME KIND OF DISEASE,

158
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:30,580
THAT IT IS PERMISSIBLE UNDER A

159
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,049
CERTAIN KIND OF LEGAL SITUATION.

160
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:34,918
IT'S NOT THAT MUSLIMS DON'T --

161
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,388
ARE PROMOTING ABORTION AT ALL,

162
00:04:38,388 --> 00:04:39,122
BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE

163
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:43,893
CERTAIN LOOPHOLES IN THE ISLAMIC

164
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:44,594
LAW, AND THERE ARE CERTAIN FATWA

165
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:44,861
LAW, AND THERE ARE CERTAIN

166
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:46,195
FATWAS WHICH IS JUST A LEGAL

167
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:47,130
OPINION FROM SCHOLARS THAT DO

168
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,364
ALLOW IT UNDER CERTAIN

169
00:04:48,364 --> 00:04:48,798
CIRCUMSTANCES.

170
00:04:48,798 --> 00:04:49,933
IT'S A VERY MULTILAYERED ISSUE.

171
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:51,301
I'M THE ONLY WOMAN HERE ON THE

172
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:52,468
PANEL SO I WOULD LIKE TO SAY

173
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:54,337
THAT IT IS AN ISSUE THAT'S VERY

174
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:55,805
COMPLEX FOR ALL WOMEN, WHETHER

175
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:57,774
THEY ARE PRO-ABORTION OR AGAINST

176
00:04:57,774 --> 00:04:58,141
ABORTION.

177
00:04:58,141 --> 00:04:58,641
PETE: OF COURSE.

178
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:02,378
>> I ALSO DON'T LIKE THE TERM "

179
00:05:02,378 --> 00:05:02,645
>> I ALSO DON'T LIKE THE TERM

180
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:03,112
"PRO-ABORTION."

181
00:05:03,112 --> 00:05:04,530
I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS PRO-

182
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:04,781
I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS

183
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:05,214
PRO-ABORTION.

184
00:05:05,214 --> 00:05:06,516
I THINK WE'RE ALL PRO-LIFE AND

185
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:08,418
IT'S ABOUT HOW WE SEE LIFE IS

186
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:09,852
IMPORTANT TO US IN OUR FAITH

187
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:10,086
IMPORTANT TO US IN OUR FAITH.

188
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:11,955
PETE: ONE MORE TOPIC, TRY TO GET

189
00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:13,723
YOU ALL TO CHIME IN ON IT

190
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:15,491
BRIEFLY.

191
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:16,092
IS THE U.S. PLUMMETING

192
00:05:16,092 --> 00:05:16,826
BIRTHRIGHT A SIGN THAT A FOCUS

193
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:18,211
ON FAMILY VALUES ARE DIMINISHING

194
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:18,461
ON FAMILY VALUES ARE

195
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:19,896
DIMINISHING?

196
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:20,630
THE NEW STATS FROM THE NATIONAL

197
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,364
CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS

198
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:24,400
SHOWS THAT LESS BABIES ARE BEING

199
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,068
BORN IN THE UNITED STATES.

200
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:25,702
THE REPLACEMENT RATE IS

201
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:28,137
GENERALLY TWO KIDS PER FAMILY,

202
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:30,306
BUT YOU SEE THOSE NUMBERS, THE

203
00:05:30,306 --> 00:05:32,609
NUMBER OF BABIES BORN PER YEAR

204
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:33,009
IS DROPPING.

205
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:35,345
FATHER JOHN, LET ME START WITH

206
00:05:35,345 --> 00:05:35,612
YOU.

207
00:05:35,612 --> 00:05:36,846
THE STEREOTYPE OF COURSE IS THAT

208
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:38,715
CATHOLIC FAMILIES HAVE LOTS OF

209
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:39,015
KIDS.

210
00:05:39,015 --> 00:05:39,782
IF THAT IS CHANGING, WOULD THAT

211
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:41,584
BE A SIGN THAT THE VIEW OF

212
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:43,386
FAMILIES IS CHANGING FOR

213
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:44,654
CATHOLICS AS WELL?

214
00:05:44,654 --> 00:05:46,222
>> I THINK SO.

215
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:48,057
I MEAN, I THINK THE SEXUAL

216
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:49,659
REVOLUTION HAS AFFECTED THE

217
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:50,326
CATHOLIC CHURCH, THE UNITED

218
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:51,828
STATES OF AMERICA IN A PROFOUND

219
00:05:51,828 --> 00:05:52,528
WAY, SAYING SEX HAS NOTHING TO

220
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:56,432
DO WITH PROCREATION.

221
00:05:56,432 --> 00:05:57,033
AND IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT

222
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:57,467
PROCREATION.

223
00:05:57,467 --> 00:06:06,209
IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE UNITIV

224
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:07,744
ACTION, BUT THERE'S ALSO VERY

225
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:09,979
PRACTICAL POLITICAL THINGS THAT

226
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:11,714
ARE CHANGING IN THE UNITED

227
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:12,048
STATES.

228
00:06:12,048 --> 00:06:12,749
FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE ARE

229
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:13,483
GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE WITH

230
00:06:13,483 --> 00:06:14,951
$200,000 OF DEBT, AND ARE THEY

231
00:06:14,951 --> 00:06:19,322
GOING TO GET MARRIED TO SOMEBODY

232
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:20,890
WHO HAS $200,000 OF DEBT AND

233
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,824
START OFF A FAMILY THAT'S

234
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:23,359
$400,000 OF DEBT AND HAVE

235
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:23,726
CHILDREN?

236
00:06:23,726 --> 00:06:25,294
IT'S NOT EASY.

237
00:06:25,294 --> 00:06:26,496
THAT'S WHY POLITICS MATTER.

238
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:28,131
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE

239
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:28,665
FAMILY LIFE

240
00:06:28,665 --> 00:06:28,898
FAMILY LIFE.

241
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:30,600
PETE: ABRAHAM, FOR EACH OF YOU

242
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,802
WITHIN I WANT TO GET YOU ALL IN,

243
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:34,937
I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME YET.

244
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,205
WHAT IS ABOUT BIRTHRATE THAT

245
00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:37,774
MATTERS IN DEMOGRAPHICS?

246
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:39,308
>> TAKE A LOOK AT OUR TWO ALLIES

247
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:41,544
JAPAN AND ISRAEL.

248
00:06:41,544 --> 00:06:42,445
JAPAN'S VERY AFFLUENT.

249
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:43,379
THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GO

250
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:46,516
FROM 130 MILLION TO 80 MILLION

251
00:06:46,516 --> 00:06:46,849
PEOPLE.

252
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:47,583
THEY'RE NOT BRINGING CHILDREN

253
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,785
INTO THE WORLD.

254
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:50,253
I THINK THEY'VE LOST THEIR

255
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:50,887
VALUES.

256
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:52,188
ISRAEL, YOU YOU GUYS COVER THEM

257
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:55,491
EVERY DAY, IT'S UNDER THE GUN,

258
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:56,492
EXISTENTIAL THREATS.

259
00:06:56,492 --> 00:06:58,061
THE BIRTHRATE AMONG RELIGIOUS

260
00:06:58,061 --> 00:06:59,128
AND SECULAR PEOPLE IS GOING UP

261
00:06:59,128 --> 00:06:59,962
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SENSE OF

262
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,197
THEIR PAST AND FUTURE.

263
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:03,366
AS FAR AS AMERICA, IT'S CALLED

264
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:04,634
THE iPHONE.

265
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:05,902
THIS IS THE ME GENERATION.

266
00:07:05,902 --> 00:07:07,737
MY SUGGESTION IS SHUT THE DAMN

267
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:09,706
THING OFF AND GO BACK TO BASIC

268
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:10,039
VALUES

269
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:10,273
VALUES.

270
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:12,158
PETE: SAMUEL, WHY DO KIDS MATTER

271
00:07:12,158 --> 00:07:12,408
PETE: SAMUEL, WHY DO KIDS

272
00:07:12,408 --> 00:07:13,076
MATTER?

273
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:14,410
>> KIDS MATTER.

274
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,813
IT'S A DE FACTO OUTCOME OF A

275
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:17,847
CONSTANT MOCKERY OF THE

276
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:20,316
INSTITUTION OF THE FAMILY.

277
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:21,584
WE SEE THAT CULTURALLY IN FILMS

278
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:23,720
AND MOVIE AND CONTENT, IN

279
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,321
WRITINGS, PUBLICATIONS, SOCIAL

280
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:25,621
MEDIA.

281
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:27,156
THE FAMILY NOW IS A JOKE, AND

282
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:28,725
EVEN THE IDEA OF A MODERN FAMILY

283
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:29,625
A TRADITIONAL FAMILY FOR

284
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,893
WHATEVER -- HOWEVER YOU WANT TO

285
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:32,128
DESCRIBE IT IS A JOKE.

286
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:34,330
SO IT'S UNDER ASSAULT, KIDS

287
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,199
MATTER, IT'S THE FUTURE OF

288
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,467
AMERICA, THE FUTURE OF MORALITY

289
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:39,335
AND SPIRITUALITY, THE FUTURE OF

290
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:41,304
OUR HUMAN EXISTENCE INDEED

291
00:07:41,304 --> 00:07:41,537
OUR HUMAN EXISTENCE INDEED.

292
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:42,839
PETE: MENAZ, YOU SPECULATE THAT

293
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,540
THE ECONOMY HAS SOMETHING TO DO

294
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,308
WITH BIRTHRATES AS WELL.

295
00:07:45,308 --> 00:07:46,843
>> ABSOLUTELY.

296
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:47,777
I MEAN, I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT

297
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:49,612
STATISTICS AND IF YOU LOOK AT

298
00:07:49,612 --> 00:07:51,814
DATA, WOMEN ARE HAVING KIDS

299
00:07:51,814 --> 00:07:53,716
LATER, WOMEN HAVE TROUBLE HAVING

300
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:54,650
KIDS LATER BECAUSE THEY'RE

301
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,885
LOOKING FOR A PROFESSIONAL LIFE.

302
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:59,021
THEY HAVE TO BOTH BE WORKING, A

303
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,724
MAN AND WOMAN OR ANY KIND OF

304
00:08:01,724 --> 00:08:02,759
RELATIONSHIP YOU HAVE TO BOTH

305
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,660
HAVE INCOMES.

306
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,229
I THINK THE ECONOMIC FACTOR IN

307
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:07,130
THE UNITED STATES MAKES IT VERY

308
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:11,534
HARD FOR MIDDLE CLASS AND LOWER

309
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:13,402
MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES TO HAVE A

310
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:14,403
WHOLE REALISTIC ECONOMIC PLAN.

311
00:08:14,403 --> 00:08:16,205
AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE

312
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:19,542
GETTING MARRIED LATER, EVEN IN

313
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:20,276
THE MUSLIM-AMERICAN COMMUNITY I

314
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:21,944
SEE THIS AS A BIG IMPACT

315
00:08:21,944 --> 00:08:22,178
SEE THIS AS A BIG IMPACT.

316
00:08:22,178 --> 00:08:22,912
PETE: IT'S AN AMAZING CULTURAL

317
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:23,746
CONVERSATION BECAUSE IN THE WEST

318
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:25,882
FAMILIES ARE HAVING LESS KIDS,

319
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:28,050
BUT A LOT OF THE REFUGEE OR

320
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,985
IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS MOVING

321
00:08:28,985 --> 00:08:29,919
INTO THOSE COUNTRIES ARE HAVING

322
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,587
MORE KIDS, WHICH CHANGES THE

323
00:08:31,587 --> 00:08:33,089
WHOLE RELIGIOUS, CULTURAL, AND

324
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:34,023
SOCIAL DYNAMIC IN THOSE

325
00:08:34,023 --> 00:08:34,624
COUNTRIES.

326
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:35,892
IT TRULY MATTERS.

327
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:36,826
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU GUYS

328
00:08:36,826 --> 00:00:00,000
BACK, I HAVE A FEELING, ON
