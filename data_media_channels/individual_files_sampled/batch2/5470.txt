but we're gonna start tonight with the French president visiting Washington today president Emmanuel macron and president Trump they've had some awkward moments I still find it almost impossible to watch the excruciating footage of the terrible death grip walking handshake contest for they each tried to prove possession of the bigger stronger longer grabbing your pokie or handshake it was like watching an arm wrestling contest where you win not by forcing the other dudes arm down you win by giving the other guy cooties or at least the willies it's very very awkward there was also president Trump's previous trip to France which had its own specific kind of awkwardness president Trump's so enthralled with the military parade he witnessed on that trip that he immediately came home and started demanding that we hold a military parade for him in Washington - I mean that's awkward on its face but it was also awkward because the president by all accounts was unable to shake his fixation on this military display even in like obviously inappropriate settings for example when the president came back from France to Washington after watching that parade it was right in the middle of Republicans in Congress losing their bid to kill Obamacare in the middle of that loss while this thing is falling apart in Congress the president held a last minute meeting with Republican members of Congress in which he reportedly couldn't even focus on what was going on with health care he couldn't focus on the legislature because he was still so transfixed by that military parade that he had just seen on his trip to France the president quote implored them to hurry up and get the bill to his desk but it was Paris and the flag-waving festivities he had witnessed alongside French president Emmanuel macron that occupied much of his attention during the conversation in an interview Republican Senator Steve Daines described the group's conversation at the White House as loose quote the president talked about France and Bastille Day and then they lost the health care vote two months later President Trump again met with French president Makram they met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York and he was still obsessed with the same thing and one of the greatest parades I've ever seen it was two hours on the button and it was military might and I think a tremendous thing for France for the spirit of friends we see that and you see all the victories and to a large extent because of what I witnessed we may do something like that on July 4th in Washington it was really a beautiful beautiful day it was really so well done but I came back and one of my early calls were I think we're gonna have to start looking at that ourselves so we're actually thinking about 4th of July Pennsylvania Avenue having a really great parade to show our military strength can I just tell you I cut and edited that tape myself like we went through the transcript like I could have shown you twice that much tape of him going on and on and on and on and on about the print this is months after he'd seen it the president was quite taken with this now the president has thus far not been able to get his compete with the French military parade not yet but honestly when France decided to invite President Trump to see that parade they had his number in terms of how he had to get inside his head he has been obsessed ever since well tomorrow now that President McCrone is visiting Washington President McCrone and President Trump will get a chance to review the troops on the White House lawn so it's possible that we'll scratch that itch a little bit for president Trump it seems likely to me that the president will talk once again about how much he loved that parade and once one of his own that review of the troops will precede the first state dinner of the trump presidency tomorrow night President Trump has decided that this state dinner will be the first one in modern history to include precisely one member of the opposite political party one Democrat is invited Democrat John Edwards the governor of Louisiana he will also invite zero press to this state dinner no journalists which is an awkward thing to do to the leader of another major democracy right invite them to a gala event in their honor which makes history for its groundbreaking partisanship and hostility to the freedom of the press but there's one other thing to know here about this trip because Mike Pompeo stammen a ssin is still in process all of this stuff about this visit is all happening while there is no Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has been gone for a while now there's no replacement for him yet who's providing diplomatic advice to the President on the occasion of this state visit this first state dinner of the Trump presidency and this already awkward relationship with this important ally who has already displayed the capacity to ring this president like a bell whenever he feels like it as far as we know his chief adviser on these matters now at least for the time being appears to be this man whose current gig has just started as president Trump's third and newest National Security Advisor but today NBC News has an eye-opening report on John Bolton's immediate past gig before he took the National Security Adviser job he was the chairman of something called the gatestone Institute well if the French president and his advisors who are with him on this trip if they wanted to take the measure of this presidency not just President Trump himself but who has the president's ear on national security especially with no security of no Secretary of State in place the French president and his advisors might have googled some of the work carried out at this gatestone incident excuse me gatestone Institute while John Bolton was running the place if so they would have found articles like these headline Emmanuel macron useful idiot of Islamism quote France on the verge of total collapse quote Europe's childless leaders sleepwalking us to disaster in which Emmanuel macron is singled out for not having kids quote as Europe's leaders have no children they seemed no reason to worry about the future of their continent oh also uh Frances McCrone submits to the Arab world this is John Bolton's gatestone Institute which he was running up until the time he became national security adviser three weeks ago this is the stuff that John Bolton has been selling for years which is what it is but what does it mean to the French president to be visiting our president who has picked this guy to be the top national security official in the White House not crawling presidents we have that last one there president of the elites and the Islamists it's not just France John Bolton's organization has a line like this for everyone Germany seems to be an area of particular focus Germany infectious diseases spreading as migrants settle in Germany migrant rape crisis sowing terror and destruction women and children sacrificed here's one in the UK is the United Kingdom an Islamist colony Obama's traditional Muslim bias against Christians here's another great headline from John Bolton's gatestone incident quote Europe the great white death that means exactly what you think it does until he took his job as national security adviser three weeks ago John Bolton was running this organization that was proclaiming that white people are on the way to being extinguished because of immigration the great white death arguments like these that open societies are dangerous and democracy is a failure and white people are gonna die out unless they turn against the non-white people among them these are favorite arguments of a lot of different extremist movements in our own country but they're also favourite arguments about the West in Russian propaganda and so John Bolton's gatestone incident has been a popular source for Russian state-run media outlets like RT & Sputnik they've also found themselves enthusiastically promoted online by Russian BOTS including accounts controlled by the internet research agency which is the Russian organization was recently indicted by robert muller for its role in the pro-trump russian attack on our 2016 presidential election NBC news documents today that John Bolton's gatestone group has been funded well-funded by Robert and Rebecca Mercer the top Trump donors who also funded Breitbart in Cambridge analytic a they also of course were the main funders behind John Bolton's super PAC before he went to the White House a super PAC which has reportedly created ongoing concerns about Bolton's conflicts of interest in his new role as national security advisor NBC reporting that those conflict of interest meetings with White House lawyers have continued since he has started the job but he has started the job he is national security advisor now which is amazing to a lot of Americans because of who John Bolton is but it is hard to fathom how that may be received by foreign leaders like the one visiting today useful idiot of Islamism here's what here's one last thing to watch when it comes to John Bolton he has only been on the job for three weeks now but since he has been there the people who had previously been charged with national securities have thought those security issues at the White House they've been dropping like flies I'm going to have to use the wall here for a second you ready ready take your Dramamine we're moving mm since John Bolton arrived in the past three weeks we have seen the departure of the spokesman for the National Security Council he announced he was resigning when Bolton came on board but then it later emerged that he didn't have a choice he was told resigned today or be fired the next we were told about the next we were told about the departure of the White House Homeland Security Adviser that was Tombaugh sir that's a very senior national security role he's out too then next it was a very highly regarded deputy national security adviser over here this would be this one of several who have already departed that's Nadia shablow she wrote the current national security strategy she was pulled she was pushed out once Bolton arrived as well soon to be followed by yet another deputy national security adviser that's Rick Waddell who's also a major general in the US Army then we got the surprise departure of the White House cybersecurity of sir who left his job at the White House and went back to the National Security Administration now tonight we have learned about another senior national security departure from the Trump White House the chief of staff to the National Security Council Keith Kellogg is also leaving that gig although he too will be getting a soft landing he will be moving to the staff of vice president Mike Pence you might remember Mike Pence last week made a move to try to hire a national security adviser for himself who he would share with the staff of UN Ambassador nikki Haley President himself reported the kibosh to that idea so instead Mike Pence will take Keith Kellogg off the National Security Council where he had been serving as chief of staff and that's fine and good but that is a lot of departures suddenly from the national security staff it wasn't just National Security Advisor HR McMaster it's all of these other people in senior national security jobs that have gone suddenly in the past three weeks at least a half dozen of them John great white death Bolton has really cleaned the place out quickly but it's worth noting that he hasn't replaced these people we've had word thus far about John Bolton hiring one person since he started someone he brought over from the White House personnel office but that's it all of those these new folks are out since Bolton started just three weeks ago and actually while we've got the wall here there's one more change involving the wall that you should know about it concerns a guy we have him up here somewhere this guy Oh control we just got my hair and said no idea anyway intelligence director at the National Security Council that guy was fired months ago as the intelligence director at the National Security Council that is a guy who was fired after he apparently helped Republican congressman Devin Nunez pull off that weird stunt at the White House that got Nunez investigated for mishandling classified material this was the stunt where Devin Nunez tried to say that he had the proof the proof that President Obama really had wiretap Trump Tower remember that congressman said he had to rush to the White House to tell President Trump what he had found well President Obama did not wire trap wiretap Trump Tower and whatever congressman Nunez had he reportedly got from the White House in the first place so we didn't need to rush it back in thereafter he just took it from them the stuff that he got from the White House he got reportedly from a young guy who Mike Flynn had installed on the National Security Council in the wake of that mishegoss that guy who Flynn had a desire had installed in the National Security Council who helped out Devin Nunez with that stunt that guy got fired from the National Security Council however according to a report from Bloomberg News that guy his name is Ezra Cohen Watney he's now back in government service specifically he's now been hired on at the Justice Department to work in Attorney General Jeff Sessions his office as jeff sessions his national security adviser he was reportedly hired for that job because quote president donald trump personally ordered the Department of Justice to hire him now we don't know why the president wants this guy at the Justice Department but the Democratic leader of the Senate had an idea about it Chuck Schumer spokesman told Bloomberg quote given Ezra Cohen watt Nix reported role in helping congressman Nunez turn the House Intelligence Committee investigation into a partisan breeding ground for conspiracy theories mr. Cohen wat Knicks new position with the Attorney General at such a sensitive time is deeply troubling mr. Cohen watt Nick must not come anywhere near the Muller investigation and Democrats will watch like a hawk to ensure that is the case so this guy fired from the White House before for his involvement with what really look like an effort to Monkeywrench the russia investigation we don't know why President Trump has ordered him to be hired again by the Trump administration and specifically ordered that he be given a job in the office of attorney general Jeff Sessions we don't know why the President himself would personally reach down and issue an order to put that particular guy in that particular place but as of today Ezra Cohen what Nick has reportedly just finished his first week on the job now at the Department of Justice there's been so much turmoil and turnover in the administration it continues tonight but it's been happening for long enough that people previously cast out are starting to get recycled into new even more controversial jobs heads up on this one hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
