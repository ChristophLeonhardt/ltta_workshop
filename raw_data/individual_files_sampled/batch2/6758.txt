late night comedian Jimmy Kimmel has apologized to the LGBTQ community following a tweet that he sent out in response to Sean Hannity and this was all in the middle of a feud an ongoing feud between the two that began last week when Kimmel had made a joke about Melania Trump's accent on his own program now again it all started with a joke about milania's accent that was made by a comedian on the comedian's late-night show Hannity didn't like it and his response to Kimmel was rather harsh but keep in mind Hannity is not a comedian and here's what he had to say in response to Kimmel making fun of milania's accent brutal liberal Jimmy Kimmel making fun of the First Lady of the United States and her involvement in the White House Easter Egg Roll even her accents Jimmy you're a despicable disgrace hey mr. Kimmel that's her fifth language how many do you speak so he was outraged by it and he went on the warpath digging up old clips of Kimmel in order to attack him as a so-called pervert we'll get to that in just a second but I just want to comment on Hannity being incredibly out offended at the First Lady getting made fun of or having jokes made about her you know because Hannity would never say disparaging things about the first lady or FoxNews would never say disparaging things about the first lady oh wait a minute Fox News had non-stop negative commentary about Michelle Obama when she was the first lady in fact here was a clip that really stood out to me during the Obama administration take a look at what Keith Ablow had to say about Michelle Michelle Obama when she was trying to encourage kids to get healthy and be active gel Obama it is so like the Duchess when she's seen about she is because she needs to drop a few my mom I want nutrition let's be honest like I mean there's no french fries happen that's all kale and carrots I don't buy it okay so let's go ahead and attack the first lady when the first lady happens to be Michelle Obama and she's trying to help kids get healthy that's fine but what about Hannity did Hannity ever say anything negative about Michelle Obama here's his reaction to a rap video that she put together in an effort to encourage kids to go to college I don't know maybe it's just me but when older people try and look like they're hip and cool and young it doesn't work for me anyway does this prove to you that the Obamas are completely out of touch later on in his commentary he made a point about how America is under attack by radical Islam and the first lady is making rap videos so he is also called Michelle Obama bitter and angry made fun of Michelle Obama's clothes he also wrote it's been suggested that one of Obama's voluntary relationships is more revealing of his radicalism anti Americanism and anti capitalism than all of the others his choice of marital partner so he has viciously attacked the first lady under Obama over and over again but now when Jimmy Kimmel makes a joke about the first lady of Trump I am so offended who would ever be uncivil enough attack a First Lady Sean Hannity as usual a gargantuan hypocrite liar person with bad intent and it's you think we don't have access to your own books and to the videos you have on Fox News but he does it all the time and there's two different standards which unfortunately is exactly the point of this story as Kimmel begins to back away and Hanny doesn't have to because a pig likes mud and so he's gonna roll and roll and roll around in it a pig likes mud and other pigs also like mud so there are very different standards for people who make these types of comments on the right versus people who make these types of comments on the left and we'll get to that now a Hannity further attacked Kimmel by bringing up old clips from the man show which Kimmel was the co-host of these are clips from 1999 to 2004 and apparently Hannity had sent out 30 tweets about this between April 6th and April 7th okay so let's go to graphic 55 he drew on videos of Kimmel on his earlier show man show in which the comedian invited women to feel his crotch Hannity use the clip to accuse Kimmel of being Harvey Weinstein jr. he also played one clip where Kimmel asked women on the street to guess what was in his pants and made suggestive comments and other work Kimmel interviewed women about their feelings on penis size while wearing a protruding object in his pants so you get the sense of what the show was like but it was a satirical show it was meant to poke fun at men's behavior and how ridiculous that behavior could be it was not done in a serious way to sexually harass women on camera but nonetheless it doesn't matter if Kimmel was the comedian doesn't matter what the context of the show is doesn't matter if it was satirical Hannity is gonna go ahead and attack him anyway now fast forward to what Kimmel said in response to all of this that it got him into quite a bit of trouble he had said something about don't worry just keep tweeting you'll get back on top or just Trump prefer you on bottom either way keep your chin up big fella XO so the LGBT community at least some members of the LGBT community felt that that was a homophobic response and Kimmel was criticized pretty aggressively as a result of that and following that criticism Kimmel apologized specifically to the LGBT community and said that he no longer wished to engage in this feud with Hannity because of the vitriol that it's leading to he said that he did have fun with our back-and-forth the level of it although he had fun with the back-and-forth the level of vitriol from all sides mine and me included does nothing good for anyone and in fact is harmful to our country so there we are okay lots more on this so to be fair Kimmel had also said when your clown makeup rubs off on Trump's ass does it make his butt look like a creamsicle interesting and perhaps fair question done in jest but some people didn't warm to that joke so look it's one thing if LGBTQ community says hey look when you're making fun of someone don't use reference the gay sex to do because it has a demeaning aspect to it I think it's a really interesting and fair point to make and it makes you have a conversation about why do we say things like that why do we have phrases that seem to again demean people in that community okay but when Sean Hannity pretends to be aggrieved really Sean you're standing up for the LGBT community and that's why you're worried really you're standing up for all first ladies you're not standing up for any of those people who are you kidding so all you're standing up for is your buddy Donald Trump so and and so Kimmel backs down and I guess is that he backed down for a couple of reasons one is man I didn't mean to you know get people angry in the LGBT community they're my friends and and I certainly didn't mean in any bad way and I was just had trying to have fun with Hannity who was a really really bad guy another reason might be keeping it real executives come and talk to him at ABC and go hey listen we don't want to piss off all of our conservative viewers it's the one thing when you were talking about your personal experience with your kid but now you're on a feud with you know one of the top of services in the country and it might affect advertisers now those are all the pressures that come with both being successful in the case of Jimmy Kimmel and being a decent person anywhere you actually care about other people's feelings Kennedy doesn't have much of those pressures first of all Rupert Murdoch made it clear the owner of Fox News that he thought it was the wrong idea for executives to back away from Laura Ingraham when advertisers started to peel away sending a message I don't care let our hosts say whatever terrible thing they want to say and back them up we are not going to back down okay so his boss has got his back so he doesn't have financial pressure and then in terms of decency he has no moral core or Center he doesn't care about offending Kimmel or Michelle Obama or gay people or anything else so he says oh yeah I'm gonna come and double down and triple down on tonight's show and he's going to and he keeps calling Kim oh I'm a sick twisted creepy perverted weird because Kimmel was the the public figure who vociferously supported Roy Moore who was accused of child molestation right it was Kimmel who did that or was it Hannity no I'm done I'm done like listen that's part of this story that actually frustrates me the most is the standards of speech that we have on the left versus the standards of speech that they have on the right on the right there are no standards they will lie and do character assassinations in order to destroy those they disagree with they will make things up in order to destroy those they disagree with they will do whatever it takes in order to basically ruin the careers in the lives of their opponents and by the way they'll even peddle conspiracy theories against minors who just experienced their classmates and their teachers get gunned down before their very eyes but then on the left we're policing what comedians say we're policing what people can say on college campuses when they're giving speeches we're police we have ridiculous standards for one another first of all let's take a quick look at Kimmel what is Kimmel's history when it comes to the LGBT community has he been terrible to the LGBT community by the way is top and bottom only unique to gay sex or does that happen in heterosexual sex as well I mean I didn't see his you know his response to Hannity as something that was meant to be homophobic I think intent matters I think who it's coming from matters and unfortunately we're too busy debating about whether or not it makes sense and whether or not it's acceptable to punch a Nazi as opposed to having a look at the bigger picture and the bigger problem that's the reason why we keep losing allies on the left that's the reason why people like Sean Hannity and and those on the right are able to successfully determine the narrative of every political discussion that happens in the country right now so we need to have a real honest discussion about what's worth criticizing who's worth destroying and how we can actually move forward in in going after the right wing and the destructive rhetoric that they're actually pushing for okay so take up things to back up what you're saying Chelsea Handler also got in trouble when she tweeted out Jeff Sessions is definitely a bottom when asked to apologize she said no she said you know who else the bottom I am so what and so I have to confess that I kind of like that attitude as to who started this fight and the vitriol in the first place look Jimmy Kimmel made a joke about the first lady his job is to make jokes but he made a joke about her accent my family members have accents I joke around about their accents I don't think it's that big a deal at all okay fine you're a little offended by it I get it and it needs a snowflake but what did Hannity do he struck back with calling him a despicable disgrace and quote an assclown now the right-wing who pretends to care about civility and not cursing Harry Trump the other day hilariously on TV said they can't he can't believe people are cursing about his dad is that curses non-stop okay anyway he said he called Kimmel an ass clown and Kimmel responded with if I'm an ass clown you're the whole ass circus see that's funny that's like the creamsicle comment I'm sorry it's funny and that's what his job is okay and so but the the right wing that pretends to care about values of morality doesn't care the tear about the terrible things that Sean Hannity says doesn't care about his cursing but the minute the left wing strikes back at all a comedian making a joke which is what he's supposed to do making power fun of the powerful because Hannity is connected to the president it doesn't get any more powerful now that's exactly his job title we on the Left go oh my god you're not allowed to do that we have to disarm everything right so finally I loved Kimmel's parting shot here at the very end of his long statement apologizing for the LGBT community and saying he's gonna bring down the rhetoric he said I am hopeful too Sean Hannity will learn from this too and continue his newly found advocacy for women immigrants and first ladies and that he will triumph in his heroic battle against sexual harassment and perversion see that is also very funny very right and we have to be able to distinguish be making an important although I would say more minor point about saying hey let's make sure we criticize these guys in the right way and monsters on the other side who are okay with Roy more sleeping or trying to sleep with fourteen year olds sexually harassing and assaulting 14 year olds 16 year olds by the way Sean Hannity also defending the sexual harassment that Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly did on a massive scale let alone defending the sexual harassment and assault of President Trump you have to understand not only the mainstream media but us on the Left we have to understand those two
