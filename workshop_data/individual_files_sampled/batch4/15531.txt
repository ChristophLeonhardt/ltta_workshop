the usual left-wing hipster journalists are at it again they're mocking the working class taking the moral high ground or he's trying to and presenting a straw man argument about the Cadbury halal certification controversy in order to make normal people look stupid but here are the facts about the Cadbury how out Easter could travers√©e many high-profile conservative and counter jihad pundits and politicians have been urging people to avoid brands like Cadbury this Easter are into their health certification in fact we have this every year with uproar about major chocolate makers countering to Islam and it goes beyond how our certification in fact major confectionary brands are removing the word Easter from the front of their packaging entirely the Sun is reported that only one in ten Easter eggs this year will have the word Easter on the front of its packaging I mean I guess these are just nondenominational non-religious egg themed chocolates right I mean that they just so happened to be sold at Easter time give me a break so some it seems like this might be a trivial argument to have and maybe it is in the grand scheme of things but this shows a clear appeasement of a minority in England who do not celebrate Easter anyway so why we all know that Easter eggs so I remove the word it's political it's clearly political the manufacturers know it the media know it and the stores that sell them know it and yet they continue to sneer and mark anyone who suggests that this is a sign of something more sinister so here's what the press have been saying the story after story with left-wing journalists chortling a horrible Christian racists questioning Cadbury on their halal certification status water is halal for instance as is air they say yeah no kidding but that's not the argument and they know it Kaveri say that their Easter eggs in the UK or halal but not halal certified we know what howell means we know that there are no meat products in there chocolate and so it's how our by default practically all chocolate is but Cadbury claims that their eggs are not halal certified is only true in the UK in fact tampering is halal certified in many countries across the world including Australia which is why one nations Pauline Hanson speaks out about it every year this is on their own website Cadbury does this elsewhere across the world as well now this doesn't change the contents of the chocolate and the sneering left-wing journalists are either assuming so of the working class that they think we're just stupid enough to not understand this or they know that we understand this and they're mocking us anyway and I really care about how our certification and so should you if Capra is certifying products as hell then they're potentially funding terrorism and here's how how our certification simply means that authorities in Islam have confirmed that a product is halal or permissible for a Muslim to consume certification worked by companies paying a Muslim body to confirm the products halau this money is then donated to Muslim causes and organizations that work to promote Islam so for instance in Canada the main Howell certifier is the Muslim Association of Canada the MA see then dishes out these funds to Muslim organizations including to Hamas link charity earth and Canada this is a banned charity group that was declared a terrorist organization by the Canadian Conservative government in April 2014 if I'm received around 300 K from M AC and is reported to have transfer fourteen point six million worth of resources to numerous organizations connected with Hamas Hamas there's a long list of extremist Islamic organizations that offer how our certification it's commonplace and it's that which we oppose there's the eysie Dave were founded by the former leader of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood it's an hour at our there's the Islamic religious authority of Austria which encouraged the use of Islamic textbooks by use of al-qaradawi a spiritual advisor for Hamas who endorsed killing Jews with swords and called suicide attacks martyrdom operation and there's the Islamic Center of Munich I said M which also provided how our certification the former head of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt Marty a keV was the director of the eyes of them in the eighties and today the German government recognizes the izm as the German headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood the list goes on and on how our certification means funding extreme with some potentially even terrorism and that's why we care about Cadbury being Harold certified it might not be in the UK but it is elsewhere and that money goes in part towards funding people who hate this country who attack us who kill and rape our children and who won't stop until our entire civilization is brought crashing down certification funds the people who shed blood on our streets and when left-wing journalists sneer at what they see is knuckle-dragging commoners they're willfully defending this evil they're quick to come together and saying don't look back in anger when our children are blown up at a stadium but they'll do everything they can to mock and jeer people who have legitimate concerns about the funding of terrorists so this Easter ignore the jeering don't buy Cadbury's go for brands that don't fund extremist organizations or better yet forget the non religious secular chocolate holiday style confectionery eggs stop buying the newspapers that keep lying about us and have a very happy Easter with your family and your loved ones you
