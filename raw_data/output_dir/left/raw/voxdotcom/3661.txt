1
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,500
These monkeys live on a giant rock
called Gibraltar, which is a part of the

2
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:27,160
mainland of Spain, here on the Iberian
Peninsula but it's right on the very tip

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,259
and it actually belongs to Britain. Back
when the world would fight wars with

4
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:36,640
like big countries fighting each other,
this place was very strategic for Britain.

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,690
They have all these military
assets up here that are a holdover from

6
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:46,080
when they had this whole place decked
out and militarized for war.

7
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:53,739
Gibraltar, the town of 30,000 people has a
really weird feel to it. It is Spanish,

8
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:57,940
kind of, kind of feel Spanish, you know
it's kind of sun-soaked and things like that.

9
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,390
But it's totally British at the same
time. It's abnormal, it's extraordinary.

10
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,700
To add to the strangeness, there are
monkeys here.

11
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,920
These monkeys are a part of

12
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,060
the Barbary macaques species. They're the
only primates living in the wild here in

13
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,100
Europe, besides humans. The monkeys have
been here for no-one knows how long.

14
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:42,759
They're indigenous to northern Africa,
but you'll notice that there is a large

15
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:49,210
body of water called the Mediterranean
Sea in between this place and Africa so

16
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,630
no one really knows how they got over here. There's
a lot of theories and legends.

17
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,960
Some people say pirates brought them
over in like the 14th century from

18
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,259
Morocco, some people think they came
across like thousands of years ago, but

19
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:04,270
there's been a lot of digging on this
rock and there's really no evidence that

20
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,659
that's the case. One thing I love about
these monkeys is that the male's play a

21
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:13,180
huge role in raising the infants. In fact
all sexes and all ages are involved in

22
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,100
the raising of children. I respect that.
So, there's actually a problem with these

23
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,260
monkeys in Morocco being exploited for
tourism. When they eat food that is given

24
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,540
to them by humans,
or are subject to having photos taken of

25
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,950
them all day, it can cause some really
bad and psychological outcomes for

26
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,120
monkeys. What the people in Gibraltar
have tried to do is basically ban anyone

27
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,659
from feeding them. This guy found food on
his own. And they've also trained the

28
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,230
monkeys, they've almost domesticated them
in a way to where interaction with

29
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,840
humans is not psychologically stressful.
That being said, they are the biggest

30
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,439
tourist attraction of Gibraltar. And of
course during World War Two this place

31
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,159
was bombed everyone had to flee, but the
monkeys have stuck around. The British

32
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,060
Army actually took the monkeys under
their wing and actually had in their

33
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,239
budget, nuts and berries and apples for
the monkeys. So while the whole global

34
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,480
empire, strategic value of this place is
long gone,

35
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,010
there still is value for Britain to have
this place. So much of the world's trade

36
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,629
comes through this little bit of water
between Europe and Africa, and Gibraltar

37
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:22,859
is situated right here on and strait.
There's actually weird superstition that has

38
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:25,919
made it into politics. Some British
people have thought in the past, that as

39
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,819
long as the monkey stay here
Britain will for sure have control. After

40
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,979
World War Two, Winston Churchill
reportedly heard that because of the

41
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:39,150
bombing and things there were only seven
monkeys left, and because of this

42
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,199
superstition he ordered that the monkey
population be replenished.

43
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,069
So this place is strategic, it probably will
stay strategic in some ways and Britain

44
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:50,740
has no plan to give it back to Spain.

45
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,120
The Borders documentaries are finally
launching. Up until now I've been making

46
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,269
these dispatches, just little videos
while I've been traveling, but all of

47
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:17,930
this has been to build six documentaries.
I'm going to be publishing the first

48
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,460
borders documentary on October 17th, and then
publishing weekly thereafter on Tuesdays.

49
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,639
The videos are going to be publishing on
Facebook and YouTube, and if you don't

50
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,220
want to miss the updates on when they
publish, you can sign up for the

51
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,400
newsletter, which I'm putting the link
down in the description. Really excited to

52
00:04:31,400 --> 00:00:00,000
share these with you, you should tune
back October 17th to watch the first one.
