1
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,717
>> Sean: HERE WITH REACTION.

2
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:21,588
STEVE SCALISE WAS SHOT A YEAR

3
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:25,158
AND FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL,

4
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:25,926
PAM BONDI.

5
00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:29,229
YOU WENT TO SEE THE "MR. ROGERS"

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,196
MOVIE.

7
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,133
>> IT'S A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT

8
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,372
>> Sean: TELL PEOPLE HOW BAD IT

9
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:39,639
WAS.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,974
THEY'RE CALLING YOU EVERY NAME

11
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:41,908
IN THE BOOK.

12
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,343
YOU HAD YOUR BECOME WITH YOU.

13
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:43,977
>> RIGHT.

14
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:45,512
>> Sean: WHAT DID THEY SAY TO

15
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:45,812
HIM?

16
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:47,113
>> OH, WE GET THERE.

17
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:48,982
WE'RE WAITING IN LINE TO GET

18
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:49,316
TICKETS.

19
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:53,386
YOU KNOW A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT

20
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,354
MR. ROGERS.

21
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:55,755
THIS WOMAN STARTS TELLING ME

22
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:59,726
THAT I'M RIPPING BABIES OUT OF

23
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,533
THE PETER FONDA LINE ABOUT

24
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:06,866
MELANIA.

25
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,935
I SAID I'M GLAD YOU'RE VIDEOING

26
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:09,202
ME.

27
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:10,503
LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU.

28
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:13,473
I NEVER AGREED FROM SEPARATING

29
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:14,841
THE BABIES FROM THEIR MOTHERS.

30
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:15,942
I'M GLAD THE PRESIDENT SIGNED

31
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:16,509
THE EXECUTIVE ORDER.

32
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,311
I SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A

33
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:19,212
CONGRESSIONAL ISSUE.

34
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:20,647
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO THEIR

35
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:21,514
CONGRESSMEN WERE.

36
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,283
SO WHEN THEY REALIZED THAT

37
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:32,592
>> THEY WERE USING THE P WORD,

38
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,661
THE A WORD, THE F WORLD.

39
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:37,230
>> COME ON, AREN'T YOU GOING TO

40
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:37,931
PROTECT HER?

41
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:38,999
>> Sean: WHAT THEY CALLING HIM

42
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,137
TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

43
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:44,504
>> YES.

44
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:48,508
>> Sean: IF HE WOULD HAVE

45
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,578
RESPONDED, HE GETS ARRESTED.

46
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:52,979
>> THAT'S HOW I STOPPED HIM.

47
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:57,784
THERE WERE TWO MORE ALTERCATIONS

48
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,686
AFTER THAT, AFTER I THOUGHT THEY

49
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:00,320
WERE GONE.

50
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:01,855
>> Sean: AND BIG GUYS, TOO.

51
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,790
>> BLOCKED ME FROM WALKING IN.

52
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,425
>> Sean: WHY ARE YOU -- IF

53
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,894
SOMEBODY GETS IN YOUR GRILL LIKE

54
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,696
THAT, IS THAT NOT -- IT'S AN

55
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,500
FROM LEAVING.

56
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:14,334
YOU KNOW WHAT?

57
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:15,535
THEY WHAT THEY WANTED.

58
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:19,839
I WASN'T GOING TO GIVE THE FIVE

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,907
MINUTES OF FAME.

60
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,510
>> Sean: WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS

61
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:24,778
TO YOU?

62
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:26,479
SARAH SANDERS, SECRETARY NIELSEN

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,113
AND CHILDREN?

64
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,416
WE'RE GOING AFTER BARON, THE

65
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:31,584
4-YEAR-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER OF

66
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:31,918
IVANKA.

67
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,619
TOUGH GUYS.

68
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,687
I'M AVAILABLE.

69
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:34,854
COME AFTER ME.

70
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:35,455
FOLLOW ME.

71
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:36,489
I'LL HANDLE IT.

72
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,190
>> THAT'S IT.

73
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:38,792
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE

74
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:39,459
TALKING ABOUT.

75
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,628
SO THEN THEY HAD TWO HOURS WHILE

76
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:42,595
I WAS IN THE MOVIE.

77
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,230
>> Sean: AND THEY GATHERED MORE

78
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,665
PEOPLE.

79
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,767
>> OF COURSE.

80
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,605
THAT IS THE VIDEO AFTER THE

81
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:52,906
FACT.

82
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:54,507
THE POLICE SAID WE'RE GOING TOO

83
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,909
TAKE YOU OUT THE BACK DOOR.

84
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,777
I SAID NO WAY.

85
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,580
I'M WALKING OUT THE DOOR I CAME

86
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:00,847
IN.

87
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,515
THEY'RE NOT GOING BULLY ME.

88
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,717
>> Sean: CONGRESSMAN, GREAT PLAY

89
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:04,551
AT SECOND BASE.

90
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:09,622
THAT WAS AN UNBELIEVABLE PLAY.

91
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,224
YOU WERE IN -- THE FIRST PLAY OF

92
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:12,425
THE GAME.

93
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,894
I WATCHED YOUR PIECE WITH BUDDY

94
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:15,295
PETER DOOCY.

95
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,901
BASICALLY IN ONE FOOT.

96
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:22,402
IS THAT CORRECT?

97
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,937
>> YEAH, THE LEFT FOOT STILL HAS

98
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,271
A LOT OF NERVE DAMAGE.

99
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:31,745
AS WEEK.

100
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:33,680
>> Sean: HERE'S MY QUESTION.

101
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:36,249
DO YOU CONNECT THEIR -- WHAT YOU

102
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,151
SAW WITH SECRETARY NIELSON AND

103
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:39,385
WHAT HAPPENED TO SARAH, WHAT

104
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,587
HAPPENED TO PAM AND THE THINGS

105
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,822
THAT ARE BEING SAID ABOUT

106
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,591
BLOWING UP A WHITE HOUSE AND THE

107
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,192
THINGS SAID ABOUT BARON TRUMP

108
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:49,262
AND THE PRESIDENT'S

109
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:51,231
GRANDDAUGHTER, DO YOU THINK

110
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:57,103
RESULT IN SOMEBODY GETTING

111
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,239
SEVERELY INJURED OR MAYBE EVEN

112
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,572
KILLED?

113
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,942
>> SEAN, CLEARLY THEY'RE

114
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:03,309
INCITEFUL.

115
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,379
I'VE SEEN HOW THAT KIND OF

116
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,848
INCITEFUL LANGUAGE CAN LEAD TO

117
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:09,649
SOMETHING DANGEROUS.

118
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,117
THERE'S FINE LINES TO CROSS.

119
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,852
WE'RE A NATION THAT WAS BUILT ON

120
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:16,623
THIS GREAT IDEA THAT YOU CAN

121
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,124
DISAGREE WITH PEOPLE.

122
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,994
>> Sean: IS MAXINE WATERS AND

123
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:25,932
TRUMP IN GAS STATIONS AND

124
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,133
RESTAURANTS, CONFRONT THEM,

125
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,471
EXCEPT CREATE A SITUATION THAT

126
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:32,505
IS GOING TO BLOW?

127
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,607
>> I THINK IT CROSSES THE LINE,

128
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,642
SEAN.

129
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,944
AGAIN, THIS IS ABOUT CIVILITY.

130
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,580
YOU SHOULD GO IN ONE OF -- WIN

131
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,882
YOUR IDEAS IN A DEBATE OF PUBLIC

132
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:43,216
OPINION.

133
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:44,651
IF YOU'RE IDEAS ARE WORSE, WHICH

134
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:45,985
I THINK CONSERVATIVE IDEAS WIN

135
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:50,657
AND VIOLENCE.

136
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:53,126
THAT'S WHERE I THINK IT CROSSES

137
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,594
THE LINE.

138
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,930
>> Sean: YOU'RE LUCKY TO BE

139
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:58,264
ALIVE TODAY.

140
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:00,867
TO THINK THAT TWO CAPITOL HILL

141
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,969
POLICE OFFICERS WALKED IN A WIDE

142
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,572
OPEN FIELD WITH PISTOLS AGAINST

143
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:13,580
A RIFLE, THAT WAS BASICALLY A

144
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:15,181
>> THE MIRACLES OF GOD.

145
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,916
GOD PERFORMS REAL MIRACLES.

146
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,184
WE SHOULDN'T GET TO THIS.

147
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,986
WE DIDN'T TOLERATE IT UNDER

148
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:20,286
OBAMA.

149
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,988
YOU AND I AND SO MANY OTHERS

150
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,357
DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIS POLICIES.

151
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,326
BUT WE NEVER CONDONED THIS

152
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:26,659
ACTION.

153
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,560
>> Sean: DO YOU AGREE WITH ME

154
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,762
THIS ISN'T A THEIR LOSING, THEY

155
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:33,600
LOST, THAT THE PRESIDENT IS

156
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:34,634
SUCCESSFUL, HIS FOREIGN POLICY

157
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,703
AND THE FACT THAT MUELLER'S

158
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:38,504
WITCH HUNT, THE GREAT HOPE IS

159
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,473
CRUMBLING, IS THAT WHAT IS

160
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:40,940
CAUSING THIS?

161
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:44,644
THE ELECTION PENDING?

162
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,145
>> PEOPLE ARE SO ANGRY THE

163
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:49,415
PRESIDENT IS SUCCEEDING AND THE

164
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,917
COUNTRY IS THRIVING AND THEY'RE

165
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,552
LASHING OUT AT THE EXPEND OF --

166
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,420
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF BUT AT

167
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,723
THE EXPENSE OF THESE PEOPLE IS

168
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:57,123
RIDICULOUS.

169
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:58,124
>> Sean: I THOUGHT THEY CARED

170
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,526
ABOUT WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND HAD

171
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:04,597
THIS IS ABOUT POLITICS.

172
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,132
THE REASON I RAN THE HISTORY

173
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,334
LESSON IS BECAUSE THEY DO IT

174
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,702
EVERY TWO AND FOUR YEARS.

175
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,204
IT'S THEIR ONLY PLAYBOOK.

176
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,205
SOMEBODY WILL GET KILLED.

177
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,507
MARK MY WORDS, I PRAY TO GOD I'M

178
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:14,807
WRONG.

179
00:06:14,808 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS IS GETTING SCARY.
