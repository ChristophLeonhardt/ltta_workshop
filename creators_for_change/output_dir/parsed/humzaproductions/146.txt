because like I'm scary in it and then I
found something yet listen up some man
you must have gone up to prophesy
Rosalyn I like you asked o Messenger of
Allah which person of all people
everyone in it it's best entitled to
kind treatment and the good
companionship from me nah that's a
serious question this man he like you go
back over he must have been questions on
his mind yet and prophet salallahu

selling or salaam was like your father
so basically if your father yeah you
don't even get bronze black brown i'm
gonna tell my dad that you know i was
like reading this other story here and i
was about this on the man and i think
his mom like she couldn't go hajj I know

don't really know you know what he did
brother he gave her a piggyback and and
they did Hajj together
he took her all the way and did that
whole Hajj think what

mommy to masala but basically what I'm
saying is if there's anyone in this
world that deserves your patience
deserves your kindness deserves your
affection and deserves your respect that
one person is your mom
