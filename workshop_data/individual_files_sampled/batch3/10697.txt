oh I was born deaf in age 14 I was diagnosed with Usher syndrome 23 I lost my eyesight in 2014 everyone was gathering round to watch the World Cup and I was thinking how am I going to watch this ask for help from some friends and hey Leo agreed to help I grabbed a cardboard box and started tearing it to make a big square who represents a football field we began filming and had no idea would go viral emotions were running high at the end of the game Carolus was very moved if it was me famous people telling me that although I don't see why but I know that we've had many views on social networks and that makes me happy well I thought that it would be fantastic if we could get to the World Cup final with that buzz in the stadium and the flags flying I would love to go to Moscow and be at the final in Russia you
