very nice luxurious plush and classy
area madam with a very very quiet
neighborhood where it's located
South fool hello hello hey I was
wondering the Jasmine is around I need
to speak to her really
so do you know that she by yard what why
for the past few months
disco she comes into work late she
doesn't do her work on time and then the
other day I go to me some tenants come
back the office doors look sad to walk
me I had to walk all the way to the back
and that's when I call her I call her
doing drugs
that's why glass knock on glass what
that doesn't sound like her at all what
drug was she taking I don't know some
white stuff is all over knows she was
completely out of it
listen maybe you can give her another
chance I mean everyone makes mistakes
I did I told her that she needs to prove
to me that she's gonna change and no
more games and there from now on
she's gonna be on this trip narrow no I
mean so what happened what happened
she's been missing for the last few days
I'll call her her phone goes straight to
voicemail and then I was on trial fire
from voice mob that's another 50 P is
this how much money like yeah something
has always been my best friends but even
I saw a change in her when she got with
TJ her asked you towards others living
life like she didn't care about the
consequences I'm not giving a shit about
what anyone thought she was just a good
girl that went off the rails
recently should be coming into it marks
all over her face when you ask her it's
excuse after excuse so downstairs I
bumped into a wall and then she comes
into her own some big goggles like she's
in some 57 video shoot she was wearing
no no could it suck outfit up told her
to take off she took her off some booze
all of our face that that's when I knew
he's been beaten a lot so when the last
time you saw her since that day we had
that fight here and I moved out
now I actually did see her I was in the
park with humza when she walked past
they both just looked at each other but
no one said a word I could tell it got
to her do you reckon that seeing humza
after three years and her boyfriend
being her rock
I'm just feeling pretty empty inside is
the reason she's taking drugs I don't
know quite frankly I don't care
by the way detective our house is awful
what do you mean you don't care we need
to do something no no no no no no not we
you you need to help her because that's
your best friend actually I do need to
do something I need to replace her
brushes then for you chief
look EJ is dangerous I found out that
him and two of his boys were the ones
that beat up Hamza sister what yeah

know that this guy is nothing but
trouble

you mean nothing to me

every day
I sacrificed we
I left him for you
I lost my best friend because of you all
you've done is abuse me why did you ruin
my life why did you do that TJ
you're not going to get away with this
DJ I'm going to go to the police and I'm
going to tell them exactly what you did
you had me
guess you made a bad choice teeth
I'm sure it's crazy to see what I've
become from what once was the feels that
with every bad decision I make the
deeper I dig my own grave I've
experienced betrayal to the highest
level but they say that forgiveness
doesn't excuse one's behavior
forgiveness prevents their behavior from
destroying your heart and even though I
know I'm in a very dark place you can't
keep on dancing with the devil and then
wonder why you're still in now hello yes

yeah it was good it was like Yvonne
South for Broadway but what was the
point of it man I want K to know that
