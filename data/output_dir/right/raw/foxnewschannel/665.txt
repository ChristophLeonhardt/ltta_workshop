1
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:10,193
JESSE: DURING HIS MONTANA RALLY

2
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:13,163
THURSDAY HE LAUNCHED HIS LATEST

3
00:00:13,164 --> 00:00:15,565
ATTACK ON ELIZABETH WASHEN.

4
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:18,936
HE CALLS HER POCAHONTAS.

5
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:20,804
PRESIDENT TRUMP: WHEN I

6
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:21,672
ANNOUNCED THEY ARE GOING TO

7
00:00:21,673 --> 00:00:23,674
ENDORSE ME, SHOULD I LOSE OR IF

8
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:26,143
I DON'T RUN, THEY ARE OUT OF

9
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:26,510
BUSINESS.

10
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:29,613
ARE THEY GOING TO COVER BERNIE?

11
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:33,183
THEY ARE GOING TO COVER LIKE

12
00:00:33,184 --> 00:00:34,718
SLEEPY JOE BIDEN?

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,254
THEY ARE GOING TO COVER

14
00:00:37,255 --> 00:00:37,654
POCAHONTAS?

15
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:42,926
THINK OF IT.

16
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:46,563
WHAT TRIBE IS IT.

17
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:50,300
LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT ONE.

18
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:52,836
SHE BASED HER LIFE ON BEING A

19
00:00:52,837 --> 00:00:54,571
MINORITY.

20
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:54,972
POCAHONTAS.

21
00:00:54,973 --> 00:00:56,506
THEY ALWAYS WANT ME TO APOLOGIZE

22
00:00:56,507 --> 00:00:58,909
FOR SAYING IT.

23
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,546
I HEREBY.

24
00:01:02,547 --> 00:01:04,982
POCAHONTAS I APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

25
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:06,183
I APOLOGIZE.

26
00:01:06,184 --> 00:01:09,119
TO YOU I APOLOGIZE.

27
00:01:14,292 --> 00:01:16,259
IT'S CAUSING HER PROBLEMS.

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,961
BECAUSE NOW EVEN THE LIBERALS

29
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:19,696
ARE SAYING TAKE A TEST.

30
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:20,998
TAKE A TEST.

31
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:23,867
YOU KNOW, I TELL YOU -- I

32
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:24,634
SHOULDN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE I

33
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:27,571
LIKE NOT TO GIVE AWAY SECRETS.

34
00:01:27,572 --> 00:01:29,639
LET'S SAY I'M DEBATING

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,674
POCAHONTAS.

36
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,309
I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO THIS.

37
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,411
YOU KNOW THOSE LITTLE KITS THEY

38
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:38,215
SELL ON TELEVISION FOR $2?

39
00:01:38,216 --> 00:01:39,983
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DEBATE WHEN

40
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:42,719
SHE PROCLAIMS THAT SHE IS OF

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,788
INDIAN HERITAGE BECAUSE HER

42
00:01:49,594 --> 00:01:52,963
EVIDENCE, THAT HER MOTHER SAID

43
00:01:52,964 --> 00:01:55,165
SHE HAD HIGH CHEEKBONES.

44
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,933
WE'LL GENTLY TAKE THAT KIT AND

45
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:58,935
SLOWLY TOSS IT, HOPING IT

46
00:01:58,936 --> 00:02:01,638
DOESN'T HIT HER AND INJURE HER

47
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:01,938
ARM.

48
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,446
I WILL GIVE YOU A MILLION

49
00:02:10,448 --> 00:02:11,681
DOLLARS YOUR FAVORITE CHARITY

50
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:13,984
PAID FOR BY TRUMP IF YOU TAKE

51
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:20,957
JESSE: THAT WAS ONE OF THE BEST

52
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,260
PERFORMANCES I HAVE SEEN THE

53
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:24,428
PRESIDENT DELIVER IN A WHILE.

54
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:27,364
DO YOU THINK POCAHONTAS IS GOING

55
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:28,231
TO TAKE THE TEST?

56
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:32,469
>> SHE SHOULD COME CLEAN.

57
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,271
SHE SHOULD COME CLEAN ABOUT HER

58
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:36,273
HERITAGE AND ALSO COME CLEAN

59
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:40,577
INSTEAD OF BLAMING PRESIDENT

60
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,145
TRUMP SHE NEEDS TO COME CLEAN

61
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:44,781
AND LET EVERYBODY KNOW HOW THEY

62
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:46,416
WERE BEING HYPOCRITES.

63
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:49,252
SHE DID NOT PROTEST AGAINST

64
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,655
OBAMA AND HIS ADMINISTRATION

65
00:02:51,656 --> 00:02:53,323
WHEN HE HAD CHILDREN LOCKED UP

66
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:54,925
IN CAGES.

67
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:55,926
JESSE: THAT'S TRUE.

68
00:02:55,927 --> 00:02:59,129
I DON'T MEAN TO DISPARAGE HER

69
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,299
WHEN I CALL HER POCAHONTAS.

70
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:10,907
HERSELF AND SHE COULD BRIT TO AN

71
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:12,676
END BUT I DON'T THINK SHE'LL

72
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:14,211
TAKE THE TEST.

73
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,920
MAXINE WATERS.

74
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:30,193
I.Q. INDIVIDUAL.

75
00:03:30,194 --> 00:03:31,194
MAXINE WATERS.

76
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:35,298
SHE IS SOMEWHERE IN THE MID

77
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,399
60s.

78
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,101
HE'LL BE IMPEACHED.

79
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,736
I WILL IMPEACH HIM.

80
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:41,471
EVEN THE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING,

81
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,440
HOW ARE YOU SAYING THAT?

82
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:45,542
THEY DON'T WANT TO USE THAT WORD

83
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:46,676
BECAUSE IT GETS THE REPUBLICANS

84
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:48,111
OUT TO VOTE.

85
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:52,616
THEY SAY STAY AWAY FROM THAT

86
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:52,916
WORD.

87
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:56,286
JESSE: MAXINE IS IN A BIT OF A

88
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:58,522
BEEF WITH TOP DEMOCRATS.

89
00:03:58,523 --> 00:04:02,159
CHUCK SCHUMER TOLD HER TO PIPE

90
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,930
NOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING

91
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:12,102
SIDE.

92
00:04:12,103 --> 00:04:13,603
>> YES, IT IS.

93
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:16,973
THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT.

94
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:19,409
MAXINE WATERS I.Q. IS VERY LOW.

95
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,813
WE LOOK AT HER AS A DOMESTIC

96
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:24,181
TERRORIST.

97
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:26,116
SHE IS TELLING AMERICANS TO

98
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:27,884
ATTACK OTHER AMERICANS.

99
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:29,686
MAXINE WATERS AND HER RHETORIC

100
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,655
IS THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING

101
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:34,191
TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BECAUSE

102
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:37,661
SHE REPRESENTS THE PARTY OF

103
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:38,461
DIVISIVENESS.

104
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:40,497
JESSE: I WOULDN'T GO SO FAR AS

105
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:42,232
TO CALL HER A DOMESTIC

106
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:42,799
TERRORIST.

107
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,801
THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE OVER THE

108
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:48,672
LINE, BUT LASTLY, REMEMBER

109
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:50,974
SINBAD FROM BACK IN THE DAY?

110
00:04:50,975 --> 00:04:52,142
>> YES, WE DO.

111
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:54,144
JESSE: I THINK HE POPPED OUT OF

112
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:58,348
THE PIRATE SHIP AND REEMERGED ON

113
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:00,784
SOME CABLE NEWS STATION AND TOOK

114
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:04,554
A SHOT AT THE PRESIDENT'S

115
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:05,388
TWITTER HABITS.

116
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:09,192
TO FACE.

117
00:05:09,193 --> 00:05:12,662
>> ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT NOT

118
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:14,497
UNLIKE DRAKE'S OBSERVATION

119
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:16,533
PEOPLE WITH TWITTER FINGERS

120
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:18,168
AREN'T AS HARD-CORE WHEN YOU

121
00:05:28,846 --> 00:05:30,914
KEYBOARD.

122
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:33,783
>> WHAT'S WRONG WITH SINBAD,

123
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:39,990
BUT LOOK AT HIS OWN STUFF.

124
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:42,692
HE'S STILL LIVING IN A DIFFERENT

125
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:44,761
WORLD OR ANOTHER WORLD.

126
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,630
LISTEN, WE DON'T LOOK AT HIM AS

127
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:47,998
A COMEDIAN.

128
00:05:47,999 --> 00:00:00,000
WE LOOK AT HIM AS NOTHING BUT A
