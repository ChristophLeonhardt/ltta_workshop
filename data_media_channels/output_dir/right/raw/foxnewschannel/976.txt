WHERE WE COULD BRING THIS UP,

00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,594
BUT OUR GOAL HAS BEEN TO EMPOWER

30
00:00:34,594 --> 00:00:36,396
THE SPEAKER NOT ONLY WITH THE

00:00:42,802 --> 00:00:43,203

38
00:00:46,806 --> 00:00:49,009
A PERMANENT FIX FOR DREAMERS,

39
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,610

AND AS OF NOW WE DON'T HAVE US

45
00:00:58,618 --> 00:00:59,853
>> Martha: I THOUGHT I HEARD

COME AROUND.

49
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:04,925
ARE THEY BEING PRESSURED BY

50
00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:06,026
PAUL RYAN OR KEVIN McCARTHY

51
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:08,228
NOT TO GET ON BOARD WITH YOU?

52
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:08,962
>> WE HAVE MEMBERS STANDING BY

53
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:12,198
IN THE HOUSE WAITING TO SIGN

54
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:13,300
DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS.

55
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,201
ULTIMATELY WITH THE FREEDOM

56
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:16,670
CAUCUS AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY

57
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,204
ARE GOING TO SUPPORT

58
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:20,240
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS FOUR

59
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,573
PILLARS.

60
00:01:20,573 --> 00:01:21,274
>> Martha: WHO DOES THIS HELP?

61
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:23,143
WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING FOR IT SO

62
00:01:23,143 --> 00:01:23,443
HARD?

63
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:25,445
IN TERMS OF THE MIDTERM

64
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:26,446
ELECTION, WHAT'S YOUR ARGUMENT

65
00:01:26,446 --> 00:01:27,781
VERSUS WHAT PAUL RYAN IS SAYING

66
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:29,816
IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON THE

67
00:01:29,816 --> 00:01:31,217
PARTY?

68
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:32,953
>> LO, I BELIEVE WE'VE GOT TO

69
00:01:32,953 --> 00:01:34,287
HAVE A SOLUTION HERE.

70
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:36,056
NOT ONLY DO WE NEED A CERTAINTY

71
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:37,624
FOR DREAMERS, THE PRESIDENT GAVE

72
00:01:37,624 --> 00:01:38,525
US OUR FIRST OFFICIAL DEADLINE

73
00:01:38,525 --> 00:01:40,794
ON IMMIGRATION, THAT WAS

74
00:01:40,794 --> 00:01:41,561
MARCH 5TH AND WE'VE DONE NOTHING

75
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:43,029
ON THE ISSUE.

76
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:44,597
I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE

77
00:01:44,597 --> 00:01:46,666
CERTAINTY FOR DREAMERS, BUT WE

78
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:47,934
ALSO HAVE TO HAVE BORDER

79
00:01:47,934 --> 00:01:48,635
SECURITY AS WELL.

80
00:01:48,635 --> 00:01:50,804
THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED ABOUT

81
00:01:50,804 --> 00:01:51,438
HIS FOUR PILLARS.

82
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:52,505
OUR CONFERENCE TALKED ABOUT IT.

83
00:01:52,505 --> 00:01:54,274
WE HAD A TWO HOUR CONFERENCE

84
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:54,941
LAST WEEK.

85
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:56,643
WE ARE CONTINUING TO HAVE THESE

86
00:01:56,643 --> 00:01:57,377
NEGOTIATIONS AND MEETINGS BUT

87
00:01:57,377 --> 00:01:59,746
ULTIMATELY WE HAVE TO HAVE

88
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:01,081
SOMETHING THAT IS WILLING TO

89
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:01,614
COME TO THE FLOOR.

90
00:02:01,614 --> 00:02:03,616
I DON'T THINK THAT REPUBLICANS

91
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:04,517
SHOULD BE AFRAID TO FACE THIS IN

92
00:02:04,517 --> 00:02:06,152
THE ELECTION.

93
00:02:06,152 --> 00:02:10,389
WE OUGHT TO BE NOT ONLY FIGHTING

94
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,124
FOR CERTAINTY FOR DREAMERS BUT

95
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:12,092
WE ARE TO BE CHAMPIONING THE

96
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:12,993
FACT THAT WE ARE GOING TO SECURE

97
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:14,594
OUR BORDERS.

98
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:15,662
>> Martha: WHAT ABOUT

99
00:02:15,662 --> 00:02:16,830
PAUL RYAN AND WHAT ABOUT THE

100
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,098
CHARGE THAT THIS IS TO EMBARRASS

101
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:20,266
THEM, TO HUMILIATE HIM AS A

102
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,469
LEADER BY GOING AROUND HIS BACK?

103
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:23,303
>> IT'S NOT GOING AROUND HIS

104
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:24,237
BACK.

105
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:25,638
I TALKED TO THE SPEAKER ALMOST

106
00:02:25,638 --> 00:02:27,607
EVERY DAY AND WE HAVE CONTINUED

107
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:28,808
TO EMPOWER THE SPEAKER TO BRING

108
00:02:28,808 --> 00:02:30,844
THIS UP, TO LET HIM KNOW WHEN

109
00:02:30,844 --> 00:02:33,246
PEOPLE ARE SIGNING AND HOW MANY

110
00:02:33,246 --> 00:02:35,015
PEOPLE ARE SIGNING EACH DAY, BUT

111
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:35,849
ULTIMATELY THE SPEAKER HAS

112
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:37,650
ALWAYS KNOWN THAT THIS IS OUR

113
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,685
DEADLINE, THE SPEAKER IS GOING

114
00:02:38,685 --> 00:02:40,620
TO HAVE TO WORK WITH THE REST OF

115
00:02:40,620 --> 00:00:00,000
OUR CONFERENCE TO FIND ENOUGH
