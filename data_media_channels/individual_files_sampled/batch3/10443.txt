Infante you know we should give these people an opportunity to get things right so you must be happy with that but how important is it from you coming from a different part of business life to have professional and ex professional footballers involved in the sport that they have given their lives to well and I think if we have one single achievement today after one year after 18 months of assignment is definitely credit that we are giving back to former football players and to active football players by having them as our ambassadors we have bobbing former football player from as the Mira was my deputy in charge of football he's also the one behind the VI air for example the video assistant referee program we have mr. Marco van Basten everybody know masala legend of football being also part of the senior management team because he's heading the technical division Africa your pride African Senegal ranked 23 in the world it's the highest ranking for quite some yeah Pele we interviewed in London famously said 20-30 years ago it will be when not if an African nation wins the the World Cup I guess really would cap a perfect year for you as secretary-general at the top of the of the global game for an African nation might be Tunisia Egypt your beloved Senegal Nigeria to do really well in this World Cup and it would be important for the continent of Africa well I think we have five good team being represented at the African continent level as you remember well Stan Senegal for sports cars repition in a World Cup in 22 went up to the quarterfinals I think that they can only do better we spoke to sidearm on air it was just him we were at live up in Liverpool and he said that that generation of players in 2002 were vitally important in his love of the game so I guess again from an Africans perspective it's important for all of those nations to inspire the next generation of African footballers within the European besty many African players so it's all normal that when they come back home really to play for their country that they demonstrate the same level of commitment with a club that with their country so I have no doubt this year and I really hope that that will be the case that African teams will be really going very far in this competition how important is it for Russian sport for the host nation to have a good tournament well let's say what do we experience during the summer 2017 through the FIFA Confederations Cup just sent a very strong signal on what a World Cup hosted by Russia could be I really was fascinated by the level of commitment of local authorities and more importantly by the warm welcome what if what pleased you the most from that Russian welcoming in the summer for the Confederations Cup because I was here and one of my roles I believe is as a black man to speak honestly about whatever country I broadcast in and I've been here six or seven times now another fantastic time people don't look at me differently on the street people don't treat me differently which is against some of the stereotypes that we are presented with and so so tell us what what pleasantly surprised you about the Confederations graphically what you just described when I came for the first time in Russia it was in July last year one month after my assignment and definitely like every African person I was just feeling to be treated differently and I was ready also to help people think differently about Africa and Africans but as we speak I've been here for at least twenty times altogether I haven't suffered any Russia issues wherever I go to explain what FIFA is doing how FIFA is modernizing its image I have received a warm welcome last year during the Confederation Cup the people from even different culture who were visiting for the first time and who happen to be Muslim receive a very special treat in Kazan because it's somehow the state where we have a large majority of the first stadium and first city in world history it will have a predominantly Muslim population and they were sending me messages since the configuration cup telling me there are five Arabic nations that qualified for the World Cup three are in Africa Fatma please know that you can count on us what you think about Russia is not the reality and to live the reality and to reap fantastic and amazing tournament you definitely need to be here in a June finally there are going to be people watching this in Arabic in Spanish in English around the world through a huge audience if there was one message that you wanted to give football fans around the world in this next year what would it be well they have to come and this is a wonderful fun experience safety and security are guaranteed and very seriously implemented at all levels in the hostages you will be discovering a country that has a variety of cultural diversity you can experience many different also let's say gastronomic all right lots of different things in Kazan in particular as you may well say and you have the thirty two of the best team in the world coming here and the world will be stopping for one month towards the World Cup so don't miss the opportunity to discover a new lifestyle and also a country that is really warm normally welcoming a fans of food well around the world secretary-general has been an absolute pleasure I hope that if England play Senegal we can be friends afterwards delighted to be joined by Paul Parker Premier League winner England international as well back here in in London delighted to have you here at RT HQ Paul Italia 90 an iconic football tournament you were a relative rookie coming into that England squad I think only four or five cups before being called up by Sir Bobby Robson firstly how much of an honor was it for you to play and to be picked for your country first and it was the biggest thing ever for me because I grew up wanting to play for a bigger team as possible and that time I was a little bit of a Spurs fan and then to plan an FA Cup final and play for England and if I was to go to now it all it is now with kids is to play in a Champions League when you say it's one of our playing for England and want to play Champions League but during that time maybe the same four year time stone is it it's about playing as high as you can and more than anything is to represent the country and that's what I wanted to do and ask fortunate enough to do it I believe English players will put their club and Champions League before their country I think the managers are telling them the most important thing for them is their place and wanting to play in the Champions League and because the majority of the managers are foreign they don't really care about the national team so and the players have got their in their heads and they believe the Champions League is what's putting them out there so they are they are fighting - for now to play in a Champions League not to play for their country because they really are not dealing with the criticism they're getting to represent their country and to be honest representing your country is a challenge and when you actually have a challenge you're willing to take the good and I had the good but you have to take the bad as well and I'm very very fortunate is because of weapon to me representing my country and then I was just Paul Parker who played for Queens Park Rangers and all of a sudden I come back and I'm Paul Park who played in the World Cup semi-final playing for Queens Park Rangers yes that lifted my status immensely but more than anything knows QPR fans haven't forgotten it but for me it just lifted me to a level which I'd never knew before in my life growing up in the 80s there was a lot of racial abuse remember viv Anderson the first black player got death threats letters by just being the first black player to wear an England shirt so when you get into the England squad and you've only had four or five caps with that backdrop of racism still in the game still in the stands was it more of a challenge for a black man to represent England then it was tough on him again when we was in when was in Italy we have training session Oakland training session and there was quite a few of them have come in and watched Bobby Robson let him in I think Bobby Robson knew he made a massive mistake having an open session because made John bounds and Dez Walker got a very Legends yeah got it very very badly I look at the point of when I saw Bobby asked me and Gaza to go and play in a in a threat arm an England B game in Iceland and it must have been about minus twenty five it was absolutely freezing I remember Tony Dirigo got hypothermia Paul Stewart couldn't play he was too cold but we played a game and I got abused playing in the B game and it was like a gang of these neo-nazis who turned up just to abuse me did you feel you had to prove yourself going into that world cup my honest belief in that was that I come there and I was a little bit content to be you know to be there from when Gary Stevens got injured because Bobby Robson was so loyal to those players during that periods but when you mentioned about a challenge I spent a hold of my pedometer the start of my Korean times in it that she believed in because I was black and I've always been brought up in that way and it was said to me I can't many years ago no no it wasn't my dad since Ted wasn't football or inside him I mean one of my cousins said you're you're black and whatever you do you could never be an equal to a white man you have to be better than him to stand a chance of surpassing him if you're equal they're always gonna go for the white man and that's the way it was that was my mentality I always had to be better and do a job better to give myself the opportunity to play Germany a World Cup semi-final the first World Cup semi-final since 1966 we relaxed because the Germans were overwhelming favourites nothing changed tomorrow what I've done before nothing change at all the bit I think where it really suddenly caught me the things that changed me all the sudden you know three years prior I was playing in a third division with Fulham all of a sudden now I'm playing the World Cup semi-final with England's was was in that tunnel when I was just looking at all these Germans doesn't matter how tall they were or how small they were they were absolutely immaculate there was like some it was like there was the 11 Manor Kings down there was just everything there was muscles in the right place they were stomachs like that and I turn around and I look around and I see Peter Beardsley I see Chris Waddle I'm just seeing all different body shapes of us English nativism there was you know if I would have been a worse than they could have been a worst team in the world bums if he judged certainly judging appearances the front cover and they were absolutely immaculate oh be honest I think I wanted to be one of them I wanted to just look smart and but then you get on the pitch and the way we started a game was was incredible so great your role because you're involved in two goals is talk about the second one took about the first one okay free-kick Germany have tell us how you saw that goal Bobby Robson wanted me because he saw me as the quickest to get there and close down I did my job Oh block the ball I've changed you know the direction of oil having changed difference was it went up it seemed like it flatlined I don't know how far shelters was off his line we can question should he a Galia but the end the day I changed the movement of the ball after that when in the first thing I thought about was Besame that's that's maybe name to cut cost England the World Cup by that by that happening you just thought that on the pitch I did think that on the picture and then the positive happens you down the right hand side bombing forward as you always do long raking ball right to left to the center look towards the edge of the 18-yard box which is a central striker is perfect because there's chaos at that point you just want somebody to see the pass you saw the pass Gary Lineker capitalizes on some panic and did you feel Redemption oh yeah without a doubt I mean it was just it was just I mean I want to say phoria but I couldn't do anything because I think I got jumped on by I'm Peter Beardsley in Gaza so for me because I'm saying again is that that's not an area of the park I was generally always in I was all proprietor that I was always in the middle I was never knocking him bought an area and all I done and I called a percentage past it was an opportunity to try and put a ball in behind and that's what I done then it is it was the percentage once I've hit in the first two and a half didn't deal with it very well and Gary being Gary's in there on his own and he picked up the pieces and that's what Gary was great at you know that was Gary Lineker that was his strength draw at the end of the game and it goes to penalties did you feel nervous excited because you were on one side step away from getting into the World Cup final but you're also one kick or one miss away from glorious failure how we feeling that penalty by penalty I was just caught up in it I was like I was like a fan just looking it that way not but not even thinking I was going to take when I was just watching income wow look where I am and that's how I was but did I think the Stuart Pearce was going to miss the penalty not in a million years because he was another one you'd have almost put your house in him scoring goals he scored so many for forests penalties you never believed that Stuart Pearce was ever going to miss a penalty you mentioned about Chris Waddle how good seed were you when he missed his penalty everyone was gutted Chris Chris was loved by everybody and he's another one you'd believe it was gonna score but everyone was disappointed I think it was him he was obviously more and the men on which he missed it Stuart Pearce was very very upset but no one was trying to you know help Stuart a comfort and relief in Stuart you left him in his own space to get himself through it Chris was a little bit down Schulz was telling himself he went the right way every single time and Chris Chris and Waddell reminded him there maybe should have died five minutes earlier than he might have got there how did you feel finally when you landed at Luton Airport and there were three four five hundred thousand people waiting for the team did that shocked you did it surprise you did it make you think crikey what if we'd have won this it did but I did wonder if some kind of ban was on the plane behind or something like that you know because you thought there was a big pop band aterna maybe the Beatles had got back together us and Barrow him because it was absolutely crazy manic trying to drive home down in one and it was scary stand driving home because people would go and pass the car coming in front heads out trying to take pictures I think some people followed me all the way back I was living in Woking and Berkshire then and I think some people for him and I don't think they lived anywhere near there so they're following me almost Holmes were to drive around a little bit just to lose rooms I didn't know where I lived and then when I did when I arrived home my player lives in a place a state called woofs hill and woken them and as I driving to me colder sake there was a big banner up welcomed me home and had a big street party for me I think after about an hour I had to go cuz I think the occasion got to me had two or three drinks I went into the house and I crashed out I've been living around there then for about over a year not really even stopped in the street if people have said to me do I know y'all said Paul Parker Cooper they've gone yeah but no one knew me face and after that it was just something after that there's just things really poor Parker really appreciate you joining us great to see you and thank you very much you woke up memory thank you very much you
