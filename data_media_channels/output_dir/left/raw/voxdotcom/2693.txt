1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,160
"The President of the United States
stands accused of sexual misconduct by

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,260
more than a dozen women over a period of
decades." "His hands were all over me."

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,139
Donald Trump is no stranger to scandal
and allegations of sexual misconduct.

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,400
"Grab 'em by the pussy."
And each time Trump seemingly escapes

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,130
consequences unscathed. "Donald Trump
approached me then his hand touched the

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,480
right inside of my breast." But recent
lawsuits brought against Trump

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,430
may put his whole presidency at risk. And
it may not even matter if the women

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,640
behind them are successful in court.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,800
The woman suing Trump are porn actress and

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,480
director Stephanie Clifford
who's better known by her stage name

11
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,739
Stormy Daniels and former contestant on
The Apprentice Summer Zervos. Daniels

12
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,879
claims she had consensual extramarital
sex with Trump at a golf tournament in 2006

13
00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,510
"A guy walked up on me and said to
me leave Trump alone forget the story"

14
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,349
She also claims that she and her child
were later threatened to keep silent and

15
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,450
that she was essentially paid hush money
to sign a nondisclosure agreement.

16
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,560
To put it simply she's suing Trump and his
lawyer Michael Cohen to void that

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,090
agreement. Summer Zervos on the other
hand claims she was sexually assaulted

18
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,760
by Trump at a hotel in Beverly Hills.
Zervos isn't suing Trump for sexual

19
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,150
assault though â€” the statue of limitations
on that is passed. Instead she's suing

20
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,600
for defamation which means she's
accusing Trump for ruining her

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,950
reputation through comments he made that
she was a liar and that she invented

22
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,540
these accusations for attention. The
thing is the lawsuits brought by either

23
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,610
Daniels or Zervos could be incredibly
damning for Trump's presidency even if

24
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,189
they ultimately lose their cases.
The first risk to Trump is if either

25
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,360
case moves into the discovery phase the
process were lawyers seek information

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,950
from opposing parties to build their
case. Trump may not be able to fend off

27
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,470
these requests. If the lawyers did find
evidence of misconduct related to their

28
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,910
clients' cases or even evidence involving
other individuals they would be able to

29
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:14,700
release those documents to the press or
to the public. The next big risk for

30
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,170
Trump is the prospect of a deposition
if deposed Trump would have to answer

31
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,670
questions under oath and Trump who has a
strained relationship with the truth

32
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:30,120
would likely be at a particularly high
risk of perjuring himself.

33
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,330
We've actually been here before. Paula Jones sued former President Bill Clinton in 1994.

34
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,290
Now Jones ultimately lost her case but that didn't matter.

35
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:44,220
Clinton perjured himself in deposition
and ended up impeached though he was

36
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,739
later acquitted by the Senate. Zervos and
Daniels are far from alone in accusing

37
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,940
Trump of sexual misconduct. "I didn't know
any of these women I didn't see these

38
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,190
women these women the woman on the plane
the woman - I think they want either fame

39
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,840
or her campaign did it." These lawsuits
could be a chance for these women

40
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:12,030
to be vindicated.

41
00:03:12,030 --> 00:00:00,000
