I'm here in Malin Beck it's in Brussels it's known as the jihadi capital of Europe this place has been the breeding ground for the jihadis that have attacked us in Paris in the batter clan at Charlie Hebdo this is where they came from and in this tiny place which is only six kilometers squared it has 95,000 people there are in the order of 20 - mosques in a six kilometer squared area my plan today in the jihadi capital is to go around with my trusty board and label them and show you how many mosques there are and ask the question why would you need so many mosques for such a small area with such a small population so I came here tomorrow Mecca doing the 22 mosque marathon and I have gone to every single mosque in maan and back to identify them the bleep thing that happens is moths don't always look like mops they don't look like you might imagine sometimes they're just like a door or someone's lounge or sometimes like a weird garage door and that turns out to be the most and that's the thing here there's formal mosques and there's informal moss and it tends to be that where the problems occur is in the informal mosques that can't be policed by the bureaucrats I'm here to bring you the truth from the jihadi capital of Europe we've kept expenses to an absolute minimum but if you can contribute I'd be grateful at Hopkins worldcom
