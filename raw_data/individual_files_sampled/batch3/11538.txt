US president is urging North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program Donald Trump claims the North can become very rich if it agrees to Washington's demands that's ahead of a summit between the countries leaders scheduled for June we make a deal I think Kim jong-un is going to be very very happy I really believe he's going to be very happy and he'll get protections that will be very strong his country would be very rich his people are tremendously industrious if you look at South Korea this would be really a South Korean model in terms of their industry in terms of what they do they're hard-working incredible people well you have to remember that for the last several decades Donald Trump has been very well known as a businessman he actually wrote a book a best-selling book called the art of the deal so we shouldn't be surprised to see Donald Trump out front promising all kinds of riches to North Korea if they agreed to his deal and furthermore we shouldn't be surprised with him indicating that things might not be so rosy if they don't go along with it this is another statement we've heard from Donald Trump and I think when John Bolton made that statement yeah I think that's what denuclearization means and we have very much in mind the Libya model from 2003 2004 he was talking about if we're going to be having a problem because we cannot let that country have nukes we just can't do it the model if you look at that model with Gaddafi that was a total decimation we went in there to beat him now that model would take place if we don't make a deal most likely now Libya by bringing that up that's certainly a threat now Libya was the most prosperous country on the African continent until 2011 the government was overthrown and the country has been in a state of civil war ever since you know people are fleeing it's just in utter chaos so bringing that up is is certainly you know using both the carrot and the stick as some would say now we've recently heard North Korea threatening to pull out of the negotiations over the provocative military exercises that are taking place in South Korea you have the u.s. forces there and they're essentially a rehearsal according to North Korea for invading North Korea and the United States Kim jong-un and Donald Trump you know playing a hard negotiation game in the lead-up to this planned meeting hopefully resolving the crisis on the peninsula so the whole world is watching them waiting to see what happens next you
