joining us now Troy Revere but Troy you're gonna help me with that pronunciation in a second running for mayor in Chicago Troy how do we say low Ravi a Troy the Ravi a love Ravi a yeah okay well you gotta use that name because Troy I'm super psyched about you I I think that your chance of winning is significant I think your chance to do some great things in the future is significant and and so really glad to get a chance to talk to you so you're running in Chicago you've got a couple of proposals that I think are important and different but before we get to that I want to get into your background just a little bit so you're in two different Bernie Sanders ads which is interesting and and you campaign for Chuy Garcia when he ran for mayor against Rahm Emanuel but he's not in the race this time around so is it fair to conclude that you're the most progressive person in this very crowded field I'm glad you asked that they actually the same question and on the show a local show called Chicago tonight they ran down the list of all of the candidates and asked him which ones were progressive and there was only one name he responded to with a yes and that was my name and so I felt some affirmation and that because Chuy and I both associated with the Bernie Sanders campaign with progressive platform and when he named me as the only progressive in in the in the field that was a big boost to the campaign and next of course would be the Bernie Sanders endorsement but you know Bernie is notorious for waiting until the last month or so and so but we're still gonna push for it all right and and given that you're in a couple of his ads I think that's probably a fair ask of you to test for that endorsement yeah and and I think that your background of which you talk about in the ad that we're showing is also really interesting so you were a student a teacher a principal and a parent at public and private schools in Chicago SILS right so let's start with that topic here's a broad question what are what's wrong with the schools in Chicago they're understaffed and they're set up to fail that's what's wrong with business it's not necessarily anything wrong with the schools is what's wrong with the government that runs the schools Chicago Public Schools is the most understaffed school system in Illinois we ranked 857 out of eight hundred fifty-eight school districts and the ratio of students to certified staff what that basically means is that the average Illinois school has 59 staff for every 600 kids Chicago has 37 staff for every 600 kids and so we have 22 fewer staff not than the top Illinois schools but 22 fewer stabbed in the average Illinois schools and that was not the case before Ron Emmanuel took over he came in and we can't begin a systematic program of disinvestment in our neighborhood schools in an attempt to set them up set them up to fail and so one of my proposals is that we Institute or that we create 10,000 new teaching and staff positions for Chicago public schools so that our kids can get the staffing that they deserve that means 22 additional staff on average in every Chicago public school that means a counselor it means a social worker it means a truant officer it means a case manager it means more teachers to reduce class sizes someone to teach music drama theater arts a foreign language the same thing Ron's kids get over at the lab school we want for every child in Chicago and we believe we can have it and that's what our proposal is designed to do so Republicans and and corporate Democrats like Rahm Emanuel would then say wow look at all the things that they want but wait a minute that's what everybody else in Illinois gets why is it unfair for Chicago to ask for the minimum for the minimum of what everybody else gets and and and it's that mentality that drives me crazy but try to follow up on that I want to ask you so Rahm Emanuel I you and I know differently but in Washington is a celebrated Democrat so why do you think he's systematically underfunded the schools in Chicago corruption one of the things that attracted me to the Bernie Sanders campaign was his analysis of the basic problem of our system that economy funnels most of our wealth to a small portion or a tiny percentage of our population and then that small group of people then use that wealth to corrupt our political system to make it work for them and not for us and Rahm Emmanuel is the perfect example of the kind of politician who's been corrupted by that money the Chicago Tribune did a front page story in 2015 and repeated that story in 2017 that showed that his top 60 of his top 100 campaign contributors all got something in return from our public tax dollars 60 of his top 100 got a contract got an appointment got some kind of benefit from City Hall there's a custodial company right now that's leaving Chicago Public Schools filthy they're getting hundreds of millions of dollars from our tax dollars oh and also by the way they just happen to donate a quarter million dollars to our mayor's campaign fund his holy and completely corrupt it is open it is blatant and there's no candidate in the race for Chicago who's willing to simply say it not just as a candidate but who has the record of saying it for the last five years the last six years and even saying it when I was subject to being disciplined and fired by the same administration that I was criticizing I was a Chicago public school principal and risked my job repeatedly to expose one corrupt contract after another because my job was not as important as the future of the young people that I was serving and that's exactly the attitude that I'm going to take in the City Hall no I love your strengths there's like three other things I spring from that I want to do as quickly as we can so you mentioned that vote you were up for presidency of the Chicago principals and administrators Association logically so you'd actually done a great work at your school that your principal that I want to get back to that as well and then what happened next so I was up for the presidency of the principals Association after spending several years relentlessly critiquing the corruption in this administration I exposed the custodial scandal charter school scandals I exposed the Barbara Byrd Bennett scandal and at by that time I was really focused on this custodial scandal and so I was up for the presidency of the Association and at that time the Emmanuel administration moved in and removed me from my job to create this cloud of suspicion over my name and they were doing that in hopes of me not of creating enough of a cloud of suspicion to affect the election and at the same time they created this crowd of suspicions they ran another candidate against me two of Emanuel's appointees their names were actually on his petitions and so they ran this candidate against me and that the story line became who are the principal's born to vote for troyler OVA or roms candidate so it became somewhat of a stand-in for a troyler OVA versus Rahm Emanuel's competition and I eventually won that election for the presidency of the Chicago principals and administrators association with over 70% of the vote and so it backfire his attempt to remove me actually galvanized principles behind me because they have had to suffer under the same corruption that we suffered under when I was principal at Blaine elementary school and they suffered even worse because I was at least in a well-to-do community that could raise money when the budgets got cut I spoke out on behalf of other communities and other principals who could not do that and they appreciated me speaking out on their behalf and they rewarded me with the presidency of this association as a result so when you're a principal at Blaine Elementary was ranked number one neighborhood school of Chicago how'd you do that three things number one using research and evidence all too often what the private eyes errs and the one person people who backed the agenda of the 1% do is they use ideology this insane choice ideology or the school competition ideology that no basis in the research what the research actually says is that you invest in building the capacity of the teachers who were in front of the children and so that's what we did number two I walked into a school frankly that was extremely inequitable and how it distributed resources to wealthy white students on one end and black and brown students who were not so wealthy on the other end and so we systematically began a process of taking the resources that have been historically given to the kids in the gifted program were predominantly white kids and using those resources to actually bring some equity to those kids who have been the store historically neglected in that program and that's exactly what I intend to do in the city of Chicago because our city suffers from the same inequity that that school suffered from and just as that program to bring equity to the school and equity means you give the most to the people who need the most and Chicago's the exact opposite we give the most of the people who need the least and we give the least to the people who need the most my administration is going to be going to change that we're going to invest in the south and west sides of this city and just as it did it playing in terms of investing in those who needed the most brought up the entire school investing in the people who need the most in the city is going to bring up all of Chicago Troy what I hear in you is strength and I love it so it's a crowded field Rahm Emanuel is not running and Troy is clearly the most progressive person in the race I think that if you were progressive you might want to visit Troy for Chicago calm and and obviously he's uncorrupted so donations and volunteers make a huge huge difference Troy there's so much more to talk about crime segregation etc and Chicago I look forward to doing that when you're the mayor absolutely thank you the TYT Plus app is now available on iOS and Android download to get more TYT
