1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,670
YESTERDAY THERE WAS THE NATIONAL

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,140
WALKOUT TO MEMORIAL THOSE WHO
WERE VICTIMS IN THE SHOOTING IN

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,790
PARKLAND AND ALSO TO PROTEST GUN
VIOLENCE.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,330
ONE OF THE PARENTS OF

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,590
A STUDENT IN ARKANSAS WHO
PARTICIPATED IN THE WALKOUT

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,630
TWEETED THIS.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:32,558
HER NAME IS
JERUSALEM GREER:

8
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,070
CORPORAL PUNISHMENT IS STILL A
THING IN SCHOOLS.

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,070
IT IS

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,070
OUTLAWED IN 31 STATES.

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,951
IT IS
STILL OKAY IN 19 STATES, PER

12
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:44,089
THE WASHINGTON POST.

13
00:00:44,089 --> 00:00:46,079
I THINK
THAT IS A STAT FROM A FEW

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,079
YEARS AGO.

15
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,870
THEY ARE CALLED
SWATS.

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,769
THAT IS A PROGRAM THAT

17
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:52,539
HE WAS ADMINISTERED.

18
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:55,320
SWATS ON
THE THIGH WITH A PADDLE.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
HERE

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,499
IS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE
POLICY:

21
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:13,220
CORPORAL PUNISHMENT 
IS STILL A

22
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,830
THING.

23
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,719
HOW OLD ARE THE STUDENTS?

24
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,719
HIGH SCHOOL?

25
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:23,600
THE IMAGE OF A HIGH SCHOOL
STUDENT GETTING SLAPPED OR

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,420
SWATTED, IT IS MIND-BOGGLING TO
ME.

27
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,450
AND ALLOWING THEMSELVES TO
BE.

28
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,759
I WONDER WHAT THE OTHER OPTION
WAS?

29
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,110
THE OTHER THING WAS A TWO DAY
IN SCHOOL SUSPENSION.

30
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,110
HE IS

31
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,110
LIKE, LET'S JUST GET IT OVER
WITH.

32
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,530
THEY ARE HARD-CORE.

33
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,700
THE STUDENTS ARE WONDERFULLY
BRAVE.

34
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,640
HE WAS THE FIRST

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,649
ONE TO WALK OUT, THIS PARTICULAR
GUY.

36
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,539
LET ME GIVE YOU HIS NAME.

37
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,689
WILEY A. GREER.

38
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,930
HE SAID WHEN HE STOOD UP TO WALK
OUT ON THE DAY

39
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,770
THERE WERE GASPS IN
THE CLASSROOM AND EVERYONE

40
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,070
WAS LOOKING AT HIM LIKE, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

41
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,009
BECAUSE LOOK, IN OUR BUBBLE, IN
A BIG CITY LIKE L.A., A LOT

42
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:04,009
OF PEOPLE ARE LIBERAL.

43
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:05,470
IF
YOU DO NOT WALK OUT PEOPLE

44
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,360
LOOK AT YOU KIND OF FUNNY LIKE,
YOU WANT GUNS IN SCHOOL?

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,080
ARE YOU A WEIRDO?

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,020
OVER THERE WALKING OUT IS A
HUGE SIGN OF COURAGE AND HE

47
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,130
SAID HE WENT OUT AND THEN HE SAT
ON THE PARK BENCH IN FRONT

48
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,670
OF THE SCHOOL AND HE WAS LIKE,
IS ANYBODY GOING TO JOIN ME?

49
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,070
HE SAID FINALLY TWO OTHER KIDS
CAME OUT AND HE SAID THEY WERE

50
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,000
THE TWO SMARTEST KIDS IN THE
SCHOOL.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,230
THAT WAS MY FAVORITE

52
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,710
PART OF THE STORY.

53
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,680
I ALSO LOVED THAT THAT
STUDENT SAID THAT HE WAS

54
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,520
CONFOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT
HIS SCHOOL'S ADMINISTRATORS

55
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,420
WOULD MEET A PROTEST OF GUN
VIOLENCE WITH MORE

56
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,380
VIOLENCE, CORPORATE VIOLENCE.

57
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,620
AND NOT MY WORDS BUT HIS, BUT I
JUST THOUGHT I WAS VERY

58
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,940
POWERFUL.

59
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,870
SO GREAT, MAN.

60
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,210
HE COULD HAVE
TAKEN IN SCHOOL SUSPENSION.

61
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,210
IF

62
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,620
I, KEEPING IT REAL, I WOULD
MUCH RATHER TAKE THE SWATS THAN

63
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,840
THE TWO DAYS OF IN SCHOOL
SUSPENSION WHICH IS LIKE

64
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,730
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, YOU LOSE
YOUR MIND IN THERE AND I HAVE A

65
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,040
HIGH THRESHOLD FOR PAIN, BUT OF
COURSE THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE

66
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,480
CORPORAL PUNISHMENT, WE SHOULD
NOT BE SWATTING PEOPLE WITH A

67
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,990
PADDLE AND LUCKILY THERE ARE
SOME RULES AND REGULATIONS AND

68
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,350
SO THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER ADULT
PRESENT WHICH, THAT WAS AMAZING.

69
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,100
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS
PADDLING?

70
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,100
I WANT TO

71
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,320
MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS SAFE HERE
BUT HE SAID HE TOOK THE

72
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,390
PUNISHMENT TO MAKE A POINT ABOUT
THE VIOLENCE.

73
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,490
IT WAS NOT JUST

74
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,990
THAT HE PREFERRED THE SWATTING.

75
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,990
HE SAYS NO,

76
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,840
CORPORAL PUNISHMENT
SHOULDN'T EXIST IN THE SCHOOL

77
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,910
SO HE TOOK IT FOR THE POINT.

78
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:43,440
DON'T YOU THINK IT IS SO
HYPOCRITICAL AND BACKWARD OF ANY

79
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,810
SCHOOL THAT IS TRYING TO TEACH
KIDS HOW TO THINK CRITICALLY AND

80
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,140
WON'T ALLOW THEM TO DO SOMETHING
THAT IS PART OF THE NATIONAL

81
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,550
CONVERSATION?

82
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,410
THAT IS WHAT A LOT
OF PARENTS THINK AND I BACK THEM

83
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,180
UP ON IT IS LIKE, IF I HAD A KID
AT THAT AGE, I WOULD SAY STAND

84
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,670
UP FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN, BUT
YOU BETTER BE ABLE TO DEFEND IT,

85
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,250
DON'T JUST DO IT BECAUSE YOUR
FRIENDS ARE DOING IT, DO IT

86
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,820
BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND WHY AND
ISN'T THAT WHAT SCHOOLS ARE FOR?

87
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,260
IT'S JUST SO WEIRD WITH THAT
MOMENT HAS TO BE LIKE WHEN YOU

88
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,760
WERE IN THE PRINCIPALS OFFICE
AND YOU ARE LIKE IN TROUBLE AND

89
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,490
SOMEONE COMES OUT WITH A PADDLE.

90
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,810
THE IDEA THAT LIKE, I
UNDERSTAND

91
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,360
THE IMPULSE TO HAVE TWO PEOPLE
AROUND, BUT THAT MEANS THAT

92
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,409
THERE IS SOMEONE IN THIS ROOM
WHERE A KID IS GETTING BEATEN

93
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:30,099
JUST TO WATCH.

94
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:31,469
WHAT?

95
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:34,919
WHO VOLUNTEERED FOR THAT?

96
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,870
OH, YOU ARE PADDLING THE
STUDENTS?

97
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,870
I WILL BE THE WITNESS.

98
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,120
THE
OTHER REGULATION IS IT CAN'T BE

99
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,050
EXCESSIVE, AGAIN, PADDLE, AND
THAT IT CAN'T BE DONE WITH ANY

100
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,050
MALICE.

101
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,710
YOU ARE HITTING A KID ON THE
THIGH, YEAH, HE SAID ENDED

102
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,939
UP NOT HURTING, THE PRINCIPAL
THE QUOTED, HIS STATEMENT, HE

103
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:57,720
WAS LIKE, IT IS NOT ALWAYS LIKE
THAT.

104
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,099
THE PRINCIPAL WAS LIKE SOMETIMES
IT HURTS MORE, BE THANKFUL

105
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:03,550
OR LIKE IT IS SUPPOSED TO
HURT MORE.

106
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,539
I WISH I COULD DO IT AGAIN, BUT
I CAN'T ACT WITH MALICE.

107
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:11,389
WAS THE PRINCIPAL
BEING LIKE WINK, WINK I GOT

108
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:13,180
YOU, I'M ON YOUR SIDE,
SORT OF THING?

109
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,550
YOU CAN'T TELL BUT THAT WAS
MY READING OF IT.

110
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,080
TO BE FAIR TO THE PRINCIPAL
HE SAID THAT HE RESPECTED THE

111
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,699
ADULTS, THEY DID NOTHING WRONG
AND THEY ARE PUT IN THIS

112
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:25,310
AWKWARD SITUATION WHERE THE
PRINCIPAL HAS TO COME OUT

113
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,971
AND TELL THE KIDS WHEN THEY ARE
DOING THE WALKOUT, DO

114
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:30,389
UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCE OF
YOUR ACTIONS?

115
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,690
AND EXPLAIN THAT YOU ARE GOING
TO GET BEAT FOR THIS OR

116
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,250
SWATTED FOR THIS.

117
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,870
I GOT THE
SENSE FROM WILEY'S LETTER

118
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,570
THAT THE PRINCIPLE WAS LIKE
OKAY, BUT THE NEXT TIME IT

119
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,810
MIGHT ACTUALLY HURT.

120
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,770
EVEN IF THE PRINCIPAL WAS NOT
THAT WAY, IT IS A GREAT WAY TO

121
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,210
DEFAME WHAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A
CRITICISM OF HIM WHICH IS LIKE,

122
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,340
HE DOES NOT LIKE HIS PRINCIPAL.

123
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,449
HE WAS LIKE, THE PRINCIPAL WAS
ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT

124
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:57,539
WAS, WE WERE ALL PROFESSIONALS
THERE AND MEANWHILE I AM 16.

125
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,810
HE IS SO MUCH GRACE IN HIS
LETTER THAT HE WROTE FOR THE

126
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,529
SCHOOL OFFICIALS AND NOT TO
MINIMIZE WHAT WILEY AND ALL

127
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,830
THESE OTHER STUDENTS HAVE DONE
BECAUSE IT IS SO COURAGEOUS, BUT

128
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,969
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK THROUGH
HISTORY AND THE WAY THE HISTORY

129
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,580
HAVE CHANGED THE COURSE OF
HISTORY THROUGH WALKOUTS AND

130
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,400
PROTESTS, THE CONSEQUENCES THAT
STUDENTS TODAY

131
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,759
ARE FACING ARE DIFFERENT,
MARKEDLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT

132
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,439
THEY FACED WHEN THE KKK MIGHT'VE
TARGETED YOU WHEN YOU WERE

133
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,490
MARCHING IN YOUR SCHOOL AND
TRYING TO FIGHT FOR

134
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,490
DESEGREGATION

135
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,969
OR INTEGRATION IN THE SCHOOLS,
SO AGAIN, NOT TO MINIMIZE WHAT

136
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:32,550
THE STUDENTS HAVE DONE, BUT JUST
TO SHOW HOW POWERFUL THESE

137
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,689
STATEMENTS CAN BE AND HOW MUCH
CHANGE IF THEY CAN REALLY

138
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,879
AFFECT WHEN YOU LOOK BACK
THROUGH TIME.

139
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,740
AND OF COURSE, PROBABLY THE
MOST FAMOUS INSTANCE OF

140
00:06:42,740 --> 00:00:00,000
FIGHTING AGAINST SEGREGATION WAS
IN ARKANSAS AS WELL.
