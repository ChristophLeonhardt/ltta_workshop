flashpoint between Israel Syria and Iran first a suspected Iranian drone is shot down then an Israeli war plane crashes it's a major escalation in the conflict in Syria so what's next in an already volatile region this is inside story hello I'm Hoshi Mahalo welcome to the program the spillover from the civil war in Syria to neighboring countries is not new but an Israeli war plane being shot down by Syrian air defenses is a first the f-16 fighter jet crashed after what the Israeli army says was massive anti-aircraft fire serious said it was responding to Israeli aggression the downing of the f16 follow the shooting down of what Israel said was an Iranian drone and the violation of its sovereignty by flying in the occupied Golan Heights also on Saturday Syrian air defenses reported repelling two Israeli raids on military bases so where will this escalation lead we'll talk to our guests in a moment Israel has repeatedly attacked targets in Syria over the years some confirmed by Damascus others denied they include a weapons supply hub attacked last year near Damascus Airport Syrian rebels said the target was weapons sent from Iran for the Lebanese group Hezbollah also last year the Syrian army said Israeli rockets will find at a military airbase near Damascus the Syrian government denied an attack 11 years ago on a nuclear reactor under construction the first Israeli strike on Syria since the 1973 Middle East war was 15 years ago the target was a suspected training camp for Palestinian fighters the Syrian government requested a special meeting of United Nations Security Council to condemn the attack let's now bring in our guests joining us from Tahara mohammed miranda professor of North American Studies at the University of Tehran from Tel Aviv is nari Silber adjunct fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East policy and from a man is mamoon Ivana WA a retired Jordanian Air Force general welcome to you all I'd like to start by asking mrs. Elba this the downing of the f-16 jet is it an isolated incident or do you see it as a new face in the Syrian conflict well good to be with you we don't quite know if it's going to be an isolated incident it is though the first time I would say in about 30 years that an Israeli fighter jet has been taken down due to hostile fire so that in and of itself is significant whether the Syrian regime and its military has the continued capability to do this so it's an open question but it is very concerning issue and precedent that took place this morning mr. Martin G so the according to the Israeli account these rallies have intercepted an Iranian drone then they launched airstrikes targeting Iranian targets in Syria and then the anti-aircraft batteries of the Syrian government targeted the f-16 fighter jet are we likely to see a new face of a confrontation between the Israelis and the Iranians well the Israelis don't have a history of honesty the drone the Syrians and the Iranians say that it had nothing to do with any airspace outside of Syrian airspace the drones were there basically and all the drones are there to monitor what Isis and al-qaeda are doing we know that I our Qaeda is protected by Israel they treat their injured they give them funding and they attacks here in government positions regularly the Israeli regime in support of al-qaeda and whenever the al-qaeda forces are losing and also on the other and another part of the border near Jordan Isis exists alongside the Israeli border and as the former Minister of Defense once said they once mistakenly lobbed a mortar into Israel and they immediately apologized so the relationship between Israel Isis and al-qaeda I think is pretty clear they want to protect these groups because they want to keep a buffer zone between themselves in Syria whether this escalates is is really up to the Israeli regime this round they've definitely lost mr. aboah why you served as general in the Jordanian Air Force you know they're not so on balls of this whole industry and the business and the process procedures involved I mean by the time the Syrians pushed the button and decided to bring down the fighter jet what kind of message were they sending to the Israeli government right I think the drones first of all I disagree what the years it gets suggest the drone has been shut down over Israel or nearby the Golan high I think the Russian know about the Iranian know about it all radar in Syria are connected to him he me mmm airbase Tel Aviv Israeli have a direct hotline with this command of Russian command so seems to be that everybody knows about the movement of this drone which been shut down on the Golan eyes as I said now I think the red line of Netanyahu being checked now I think the communication all the talks between him and Putin they're not valuable or have no value Putin is looking for his national interest so that's what is concerned him I think also that's checked on Israel if they want to make sort of a buffer zone nearby Golan I doubt they can do that so the Iranian influence the land bridge is there Iranian officers are nearby the Golan within seven kilometers of the Israeli so the Israeli can do nothing at this stage let's see at the what's gonna happen at the end of the day escalation is there but I don't think they will escalate any further as you know the Israeli diplomacy is working out through the American or the Russian also up to now we didn't see any I mean you know all the concern this and there I see a point wedding okay eight Minh misses misters Elba the Israeli policy so far in Syria has been the following they would only interfere when they saw one with the gut intelligence that the Iranians are trying to send some game-changing weapons systems to Hezbollah now we're seeing a new pattern which is basically going after what the Israelis considered to be a growing Iranian military presence in Syria is this an indication that in the near future what we're going to see is basically a new showdown between the Iranians and the Israelis well that's correct Israel has made its red lines in Syria clear for a number of years now initially was game-changing weaponry sent by to Iran to its allies in Lebanon Hezbollah via Syria as well as Iran in Lebanon trying to in Hezbollah trying to set up a terrorist base on the Golan Heights border now Israel is seeing something a bit more severe which is Iran actually trying to turn Syria into a Forward Operating Base for itself for its military forces in Syria as well as installing in Syria more precision guided missiles that obviously pose a threat to Israel so these red lines have been made very clear by Netanyahu and his government for a few months now they act on those red lines which again they've made very clear and the the onus I would say is on Iran and the Assad regime and its other allies to behave with responsibility and caution given the very real threat of escalation due to their nefarious behavior cimarron TV israelis sent senior diplomats to Washington and Moscow over the past few months to express concern about what they consider to be a growing influence of Iran in Syria and this is basically what they say they say that they have seen a pattern which is the Iranians trying to expand their arc of influence all the way from Tehran to link up with Hezbollah in Lebanon through the Golan Heights I mean what is the what is the Iranian narrative when it comes to this particular accusation leveled against them by the Israelis well the Israeli narrative is very similar to its sister apartheid regime in South Africa back in the days when we had apartheid their apartheid South Africa like the Israeli regime abused the natives and would regularly attack its neighbors just like the Israeli regime on the other hand the ANC the African National Congress and the late Nelson Mandela they were terrorist organizations they were communists according to apartheid South Africa and Western countries basically mimicked that position and we know that not President Nelson Mandela was still a terrorist according to US law when he was the president of South Africa and he couldn't enter the United States because he was a terrorist and so as they and see the Israeli machine does the same thing they use Iran like the apartheid South Africa and Western governments and the Western media back then to create fear so that they would turn attention away from the reality and that is the subjugation of the people of that black Africans in South Africa and the subjugation of people in neighboring countries that's exactly what Israel is doing as well the Iranians are in Syria with the permission of the Syrian government the Iranians are there to help defeat Isis and al Qaeda which they are doing we know for example that the head of Israeli Defense Intelligence said that we prefer Isis over the Syrian government and he also he was deeply concerned that the Syrian government would survive so when you see that sort of that sort of language and on the other hand when you see the language of the former head of Mossad who admitted on al-jazeera that the Israeli regime treats the wounded of al Qaeda remember this is al Qaeda the group that carried out 9/11 and he said we do this because they do not attack us they do not target us so it's obvious who is siding with the extremists and who isn't and the in again the Syrians and the Iranians say that the drones are out there to defend Syria against the extremists and let's imagine that's let's let's say that somehow this drone went over an Occupy Syrian territory and straight into Israel the Israelis have been flying over Lebanon bombing Syria not just Hezbollah or anyone else they've mostly been bombing ok Syrian army targets in defense of the extremists on their border with Syria mm-hmm there's no comparison mr. Abu Noir this is not the first time that the Israeli government launched air strikes against targets inside Syria we've they've done that in the past although they never admit responsibility for that but why this time the Syrian government decided to retaliate an actual fact the Syrian government retaliate if you remember Hashim nine month ago when they fired service to air missile man he service to service my side towards the Israeli raid a nearby dry rot that malaria it is a message for the Israeli that you can't do anything about the Iranian influence it is there the land branch is there and it's a fact let's face it Israel cannot conduct I think a two-front operation at this moment the nature of Wars change Hezbollah and these France got like a hundred fifty thousand missile the Israeli air defense system the Iron Dome hates the arrow missile I don't think they can handle this mess of firing that would be a saturation of the air defense of the Israeli and that's will affect their infrastructure high-value targets cetera and we might see a regional war sort of thing and I don't think both sides want to do that so I think we might see some diplomatic effort which can gonna contain this with some limited surgical Flight strike on the Israelis okay so really so if all the parties are trying to say away from any escalation or confrontation in the near future mrs. Elba we have now four key players as far as the conflict in Syria is concerned Iran Russia sorry three key players Iran Russia and Israel do you think that Russia could step in and try to broker a deal well I think that's that's what the Netanyahu government is hoping that Russia steps in and restrains it's a Syrian and Iranian allies I will just say as far as context goes that after the last real direct Israel Syria war in 1973 for about forty years the Syrian Israeli border was Israel's quietest border and only in recent years with the onset of the Syrian civil war and Hezbollah and Iran's involvement in that war a real bloody involvement targeting innocent men men women and children in many cases bombing hospitals and bakeries and so on Israel actually stepped in to take care of its own strategic interests and that those interests should be taken into account in any future actions mm-hmm what is it that mr. Bundy Russia has intervened in 2014 tilting the ground in favor of President Bashar al I said it has implemented the s400 missile defense system which gives it huge leverage over the conflict in Syria are they likely to be best positioned this time to try to prevent any further descent into violence well I think as your guess in Jordan rightly pointed out the nature of war has changed the Israelis have carried out numerous onslaughts against the people of Gaza and they've massacred thousands of people during these attacks but they failed to take the city a city that's surrounded that's often on the verge of starvation but the Israelis failed in Lebanon Hezbollah defeated Israel and now we see that the Israeli Air Force is more vulnerable than we think and I believe that probably better air defense weapons exist but are currently kept under lock and key so I think the Israeli regime has to be careful about how it tries to implement its interests the United States and Israel both supported the extremists in Syria from almost day one they're just as I mean the United States is guilty then more guilty than anyone else because of what happened in in Syria we know from the 2012 Defense Intelligence Agency document where the United States knew that the extremists were the major fighting force in Syria from early on in the fighting and they knew that neighboring countries were supporting these groups and as general Flynn Michael Flynn on al-jazeera admitted the United States took a willful decision to support these extremists and later on we saw that Europe paid the price the Israeli regime is also for its so-called national interests it's supporting I Isis at least indirectly and al-qaeda directly and this is something that I think the international community should take note of countries like China and Russia should take note that Israel is a country that alongside the United States who will use extremists as tools and that could be dangerous for Central Asia in the future so I think that ultimately Israel is paying a price at the international level and also it's being seen as the aggressor in Syria mister because it downs a drone allegedly flying over here by bombing Syria and it's bomb Syria repeatedly and by using Iran as a scapegoat it's just like what apartheid South Africa did with regards to a and C they blamed the Russians the Soviet Union the Communists in order to subjugate Africans and the West supported it okay now if we look if we try to look the next step forward mr. abou Noir this is the political reality now in Syria a weakened President Bashar al Assad but with the backing from Iran and Syria and Russia is managing now to reverse some of the gains made by the made by the rebels the Americans influence in the region is waning so we're left with two key players inside Syria Iran and Russia is this going to have any kind of impact in the near future about President Bashar al Assad are we going to see him likely to gain more ground or what no I think Iran is gonna stay in Syria and fluence wise has been established within I mean in Lebanon Syria up to the sea in actual fact now brush I need Iran on especially on tactical level there they have the differences on a strategic but they're gonna be as an axis in the future I think both Russia Iran's supporters had to remain Stan as they try to Aston eyes sushi and the gana Aston eyes also jenavian the future but I could see that solution may maybe come up like federal of Syria North Kurds that's what's up by the American also we can be SDF that would not work out for the American Turkey adlib and the area and the center part of I said new Syria but I think I said will lose power or or he should not control these federal state in the future that's the the way I see as a solution but Assad will stay there for a while till we got might be because there is no political framework really now working to have a right solution you see mr. Silber I mean the Syrian government has managed to take over an area which is about 13 kilometer from Mount Hermon and over the past few months they hold narrative words about what is going to happen in places like Italy but what we're seeing now is talks about potential confrontations when the fight goes back to areas like that and Canadia is this something which has been closely monitored by the Israeli government do they consider this to be another red line if it happens absolutely this has been a red line for quite some time an Iranian and Hezbollah presence in southern Syria on the border with the Golan Heights and with Israel is a red line for the Israeli government and that should be made very clear to everyone not only to the Assad regime and to Iran but also Russia as well as the United States I will just say that yes the nature of war might be changing but Israel still has the most powerful military in the area and that if there is really an escalation which we all hope won't be the case but if there is an escalation then I believe the Syrians and the Iranian interest inside Syria as well as perhaps Lebanon if Hezbollah Dane's to to get involved will suffer a lot more than than Israel and the Israeli population hmm mr. Milan G Burchard Netanyahu said a few days ago that he would never allow the Iranians to maintain a permanent military presence in Iran for quite some time the debate about Syria was about the need to find a peaceful way out of this crisis where thousands of people were killed but suddenly this whole narrative is shifting towards something else the potential for an explosive situation where the Iranians might find themselves fighting against the Israelis how is this seen by the Iranian decision-makers well my understanding is that in Iran the view is basically that this is more about Netanyahu and his wife than anything else this recent event and they basically want to turn attention away from the charges that are being leveled against them and this of course the fact that the Israelis loss a very highly advanced f-16 I think make this makes this actually much worse for Netanyahu the Iranians are will stay in Syria as long as the Syrian government wants and they will help the Syrians regain their full sovereignty the Americans like the Israelis don't want this to happen that's why they continue to support extremists and in in the East and in the north they've aligned themselves with PKK allied groups that is outraged turkey so that the policies of the United States we see have isolated it both in Iraq and in Syria and the Israelis are not going to fare much better and as with regards to the point that the the claim made about the power of Israel Israel is no match for Iran Israel its powers basically linked to the United States Iran is not going to initiate any conflict with the Israeli regime Iran believes that Israel must see to exist because it is an apartheid state like its sister apartheid regime in in South Africa I see by the way the Israelis gave the apartheid regime in South Africa me clear weapons too but but the Israelis should recognize that if they initiate any conflict against Iran or against friends of Iran Israelis will definitely not okay let me go to mr. Aborn Obama set up on a while what if the Israelis decided to retaliate and then the Iranians decided to fire back what kind of scenario do you see for the future of Syria and the region I could see that a containment for the this escalation gonna be and I don't know I can't speculate in days possibly but we will see continuous of Israeli strike face-saving for the red card of nittany our rather than that that is right knows very well and as their general that's the nature of war has been changing there is two front with 150,000 missile that's an effect of course Israel is a nuclear power but it's not gonna be escalating to that much that they're gonna use small tactical nuclear so what we gonna see is I think containing the this escalation a couple of days or less than that I can't speculate and there and preventing it from spinning out of control also there's very important point that Israel or American all the Russian cannot stop the Iranian manoeuvring and our thank you thank you do it very skillfully mr.
