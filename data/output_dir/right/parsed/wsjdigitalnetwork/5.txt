(calm music)
- I want lawmakers to
see that it's just not
one high school trying to create change.
It's multiple high schools,
it's multiple students,
and it's the nation that
wants to see change.
- I think the walkout is a way to show
how strong our generation is
and how much power we have
and the power of our voices as a whole.
- I think that it's the same point
that we've been trying to make all along,
just in a more symbolic way,
that we're not going away.
- For us it has been
overwhelming being in the media
and being in the public
eye, but we need to be.
And all schools need to be because
it shows that we need to be safe.
- As hard as they try to
maybe make the country
ignore us or divert the attention
away from it, we're not going away.
We're not gonna let that happen.
- My feelings are like a wave.
At some points I feel nothing at all
and that's really hard because
I don't want to feel okay.
It's a weird things to say,
but I want to feel upset.
But the points I'm upset I just
wonder when will this feeling end?
Like when will I feel okay again?
- We, out of everybody,
understand the consequences
of ignoring this kind of
thing over and over again
and we're not gonna let that
happen to another community.
- What happened to me and my school
will forever change the rest of my life
and I would forever fight
for what I believe in
and for gun reform and gun control
because it just hits so hard to home.
