regarding Paul Manafort getting charged eight out of 18 of the charges in his trial and also news of Michael Cohen taking a plea deal where he confesses that he paid to women Karen McDougal and stormy Daniels hush money at the direction of Donald Trump Donald Trump had a meltdown which is to be expected now he went on a you know rally or did a rally in West Virginia but today he decided to like break everything down from his perspective and here's what he had to say first he gave Paul Manafort a lot of credit I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family justice took a 12 year old tax case among other things apply tremendous pressure on him and unlike Michael Cohen he refused to break make up stories in order to get a deal such respect for a brave man ok so let's review what he just got ran afford just got convicted for ok a jury of his peers listened to the trial on eight huge charges they and likely to go to prison for the rest of his life among the things that he was convicted of was not reporting thirty million dollars to in taxes hit it offshore and he did that fraud that he while he was working for the pro-russian Ukrainian government so that unlike you he wouldn't have to pay tax that's right okay that he could just hide it offshore cuz he's rich enough to hide it offshore and to violate the laws of this country and then he can't committed other fraud to take more money that he didn't deserve from in the form of loans etcetera Trump is like what a brave man what what a brave man for hiding his money what a brave man for breaking the law the only thing that matters to Trump for obvious reasons is whether or not these associates or former associates are gonna turn on him men afford so far has not turned on him and so that's what he considers brave like oh he's willing to take the fall for me because Manta Ford could have negotiated some sort of plea deal he didn't and so that's what Trump is applauding him for by the way just to be absolutely clear Manta for worked as a foreign agent did not tell the US government about it made sixty million dollars over the course of ten years doing that hid 30 million dollars from the US government so he wouldn't pay taxes then went broke he went broke after making sixty million dollars just let that sink in for a second and then since he was so broken desperate for cash lied to banks to obtain loans that's what manna fortune he is a disgusting human being so so I'm gonna say one more thing here he said he refused to break you know what he sounded like he sound like a mob boss he was a good man he refused to break why are you so afraid of him breaking like I know you Magga guys you're so unbelievably stupid that you think oh no no they would break and make up store like all of them I bet the mob guys also would break and make up make up stories no they break it they tell the truth okay and he's just saying it right in front of you he's a go it's good man he wasn't a rat you know what I'm saying it wasn't a rat he didn't give us up okay gee I wonder what you did with him before I wasn't sure that he did something with Manta port I knew Manta fort was crooked now he's convicted we know that who which President goes out after a guy's convicted of all these crimes he goes what a great guy what a wonderful criminal that's Donald Trump you want to celebrate criminals along with Donald Trump don't ever say you're for rule of law don't ever say you're for law and order cuz you're not you're unbelievable hypocrite and if you think really breaking meant that he was gonna make up stories you're also an idiot breaking means he's gonna tell the truth about Trump so now I dunno it turns out man afford does have stuff Trump otherwise Trump wouldn't be worried about him breaking so they're the manna for saga isn't over he's facing another federal lawsuit in Washington DC so just something to keep in mind for the future but more importantly there is talk about whether or not mana Ford might take some sort of deal in the sentencing process for the crimes that he has been convicted of because if he does have dirt on Trump there is some possibility that he could trade that information for a lesser sentence I think that that's unlikely to happen this is just my speculation my prediction because Trump has made it in my opinion clear that he is ready and willing to pardon people and it seems as though mana Ford is banking on Trump pardoning him we'll see that's just my prediction for the future all right now what else did he have to say Michael Cohen pled guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime wrong New York that's why he pled guilty that's kind of the definition of guilty the judge accepted it the prosecutors charged it he agreed everyone in the system agreed it was a crime that's why he's facing three to six years in prison you don't go to prison if you didn't commit a crime I know he's talking about it as if it's someone who cheated on their diet like hey did you eat that extra piece of cake that you weren't supposed to eat like people say that colloquially hey it's not a crime right except when it's an actual crime that you just got convicted of yes there's more if anyone is looking for a good lawyer I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Cohen his longtime fix-it attorney fix-it lawyer all of a sudden he's like I know don't hire that guy yeah I mean all it Giuliani was talking about how you know Cohen has a long long history of lying and deceit then why did Trump hiram exactly and why did he keep him for all those years if he has a long long history of deceit because that's the one part Giuliana is telling the truth about yes Cohen does have a long history of lying or Donald Trump that's why Donald Trump hired yeah I'm jumping around a little bit but let's go back to mana for it this was my last favorite tweet from Trump in this meltdown that he had he said a large number of counts 10 could not even be decided in the mana fort Paul Manafort case witch-hunt no but he was convicted of eight of them and it was a mistrial when it came to the other charges because not all of the jurors agreed right so that doesn't anyway like no no no but that's what's hilarious about this it's like you get convicted of you know rape and murder and bank robbery but the jury deadlocked on whether you're a co-conspirator on jaywalking and you know and and a mugging ha ha not guilty you know what I'm saying right no he's going to prison for the rest of his life that's pretty guilty two easy ways for the Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on YouTube
