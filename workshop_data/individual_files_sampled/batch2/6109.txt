we have some new poll numbers on gun reform to share with you first let's go to some numbers from CNN 70% support stricter gun control it was just 52 percent in October so that's a giant tick up in the numbers there 27 percent opposed stricter gun control let's take a look at the USA Today poll 76% want to ban people with mental illnesses from purchasing guns sixty-three percent want semi-automatic weapons banned and then I saved the doozy for the final one here jank look at the Quinnipiac poll ninety-seven percent of people support universal background checks so that includes obviously you know overwhelming majority of Democrats but in overwhelming majority of independents overwhelming majority Republicans overwhelming majority of gun owners which actually gets to a point that you make all the time which is the real problem it's not even the NRA the real problem is the leadership of the NRA because the leadership of the NRA is bought by the gun makers so if you speak to you know regular runner that run-of-the-mill gun owner they're gonna tell you yeah I don't want anybody getting a gun without a background check because then they think that that affects their right to own a gun so we're all on the same page here but there's this mucked up fake debate that's what it looks like to me because the people who make the guns want there to be a fake debate and they have money in power so a couple points off that when asked in a another part of the poll how many of you do you think have excellent or or just good faith that Congress is going to take action on this only 19% said yes that they have any faith now 97% believe we should have universal background checks but only 19% think we're gonna get them do you think we live in a democracy because apparently the American people don't think we live in a democracy if 97% of the people believe something in a democracy well it would certainly become law but not in our country because now the NRA and before it wasn't as bought by the gun man if I just went in first started it really was for the members it was for people who were actually used when hunting use rifles etc now they have get more money from weapons manufacturers it's all about the money Lebowski so they take some portion of that and they give it to the politicians thirty million dollars to Donald Trump three million dollars to Marco Rubio by the way over seven million dollars to John McCain and the list goes on and on of millions of dollars the NRA has funneled for the weapons manufacturers to the politicians so 97% of you agree who cares what do you think this is a democracy and and by the way why is that that gun owners want that universal background check well if you say if you're a law-abiding citizen and you go to your local shop to buy a gun you got a through go through a background check but you just go to a gun show and there are no rules there and you can just anybody can buy a gun yep well number one that's not fair yeah right number two anyone can see that that totally gets rid of the rule where you have to buy it legally number three you can see how the bad guy would immediately go to a gun show to buy the guns and it's against the rule of law and and kinda made a really important point there if you abuse the Second Amendment this much and say there are no rules at all to the second Ameri it's not constrained by anything I could get an RPG and fire you know missiles at you and I can get a tank and I can get a nuke and I can get it illegally to get well not illegally now it's legal at a gun show without any background checks guess what they're gonna do finally at some point people are gonna go maybe the Second Amendment sucks maybe we should take it away and people who like the Second Amendment go wait wait no no why aren't we doing background checks on people then the bad guys will get guns yeah and there's another really important point here too which is hey Democrats run on this issue they're not running on this issue and you know what's really fascinating about this on many issues the Democrats and the Republicans have similar donors so you kind of see why it is that the Democrats are weak on like Wall Street for example and why they often do you know center-right policies and the Republican light but on the issue of guns this is a rare issue where they're actually not bought off by the NRA the overwhelming majority of Democrats do not take any money from the NRA or gun makers so this shows you the fundamental weakness of the Democrats because even when they're not bought off they're still doing the wrong policy they're still not fighting for it and you know I covered a story on my show a few weeks ago about how even in red districts this issue was popular if you run on universal background checks for example even if you go as far as a ban on high-capacity magazines even in red districts people are like yeah we want this because you know what regular people have kids and they see how often these kids are getting massacred at schools but the Democrats are failing to fight back and it shows you that they're weak and they have no clue how to win elections they're utterly clueless well that's the unfortunate byproduct of a system that systematically selects weak Democrats now they select weak Democrats so that they'll lay down to Wall Street so they'll lay down to the pharmaceutical companies and the oil companies and the defense companies but once you've selected a person whose job is to lay down when he gets to the gun manufacturers he's like I don't know I've been trained to lay down so I'm gonna lay down now this is not theoretical but we covered a story last week where Senate Democrats talked to reporters on the hill and said we're not gonna run on this issue because it might hurt Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp chances in their races and they said well then the other side will say that we're trying to take away everyone's guns well you could counter that by talking and making your own points but they're so used to surrendering and they've been pre-selected to surrender that even on an issue where they're not bought they surrender because that's that's in their nature I mean for God's sake we know for a fact that it's not in dispute the Democrats have said individual Democrats can run in their own districts or States on this issue but there will be no Nash messaging from the Democratic Party on this issue they will not fight on this issue if you don't fight on an issue where you have 97 percent of the American people behind you what will you find out and the answer is absolutely nothing well they're gonna do is break down the barriers and they're gonna be stronger together and they're gonna use some more platitudes and cliches that's the message yeah if if you act if they actually fought on this they could win not only policy fights in a new Congress but you could win politically it would actually help you to get more victories I don't know if you know this but when 97 percent of the people are on your side that's usually a winning electoral strategy and by the way you know we keep using a 97% number and that's the layup but put that aside that's a specific issue of universal background checks in the gun show loophole etcetera but two-thirds of Americans 66 percent say they want tighter gun control across the board two-thirds across the board you got two-thirds of American people on your side you don't fight then retire go step aside let Justice Democrats come in let progressives come in let uncorrupted progressives come in just surrender already though of course the only time they ever actually do fight is in primaries when there's a chance the progressives against the progressives who are uncorrupt you just watch the video by The Young Turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member
