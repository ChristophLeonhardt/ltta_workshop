00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,429
hey everyone miles<font color="#E5E5E5"> died here bleh 376</font>

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:05,279
now there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font>

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,830
lately as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine review stage a</font>

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,080
part of this TV show up stage and

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,269
there's no point<font color="#CCCCCC"> in explaining it now I</font>

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,610
accept read the description<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you want</font>

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of background but I don't feel I</font>

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,260
could say it all just<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the top of my</font>

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">head so I've had to write it down and I</font>

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,430
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to position the camera so it didn't</font>

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,260
look like I was reading it but then it

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,810
didn't have sort of the natural flow so

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really turn out but</font>

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,740
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> meanings all there and the reason</font>

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,210
I'm reading it is because I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

16
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,100
sure i tackle every aspect of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because</font>

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,260
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very delicate issue so here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we go</font>

18
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">so today I returned from the town of</font>

19
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,829
bristol in southwest England where we

20
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,110
had completed 24 hours of broadcasting

21
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,450
on a brand new online and BBC television

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,610
show called up stage with a group of

23
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,920
bloggers from across the UK<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iraq</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,980
called you stage and we were through to

25
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,899
the finals and as you can imagine the

26
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,010
other members<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I are</font>

27
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,109
absolutely amazed and we are so so

28
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,789
grateful for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the support say thank</font>

29

you thank you thank you there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been an</font>

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,188
to an artificial world none of us have

<font color="#E5E5E5">ever experienced before and it's only</font>

33
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,960
now that I'm able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> relax reflect and</font>

34
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,790
respond<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some of the comments throwing</font>

35
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,159
our way although the vast majority were

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,229
positive I think it's important to

37
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:17,930
respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other end of the spectrum</font>

38
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using this format so it is possible</font>

39
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">to present a thoughtful and uncensored</font>

40
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,619
response previously this<font color="#E5E5E5"> could not been</font>

41
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,600
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> due to the editorial control and</font>

42
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,210
censorship of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BBC which they had</font>

43
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,939
applied the past four days<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it was</font>

44
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun Istanbul reasons the main accusation</font>

45
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,790
is that we have no talent and this

46
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,650
ignites the discussion at so many

47
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,170
different levels talent is a subjective

48
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,479
thing and what it is will differ from

49
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,729
one person to the next let's quickly

50
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,799
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> to dictionary definitions of</font>

51
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,920
what the word talent means first so the

52
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,750
first definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's a special</font>

53
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,799
natural ability or attitude and I say we

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,360
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who all bring something to</font>

55
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,570
the team in the act of you stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

56
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,329
two is the capacity for achievement or

57
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,910
success and with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we have</font>

58
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,949
proven success in that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> created</font>

59
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:11,840
such a large

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">munity of support enough to help us</font>

61
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,830
winning stage and from scratch we have

62
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,420
formed a team and demonstrated as

63
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,819
intended that communities can achieve

64
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:22,580
anything we hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build on this</font>

65
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,319
success in the same way that we all hope

66
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,940
to build on any goal you reach in life

67
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,580
and for us you stages our goal has now

68
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,530
moved to the point of wanting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to win</font>

69
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,900
this entire competition back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main</font>

70
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,580
discussion though what is entertaining

71
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,040
and what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Talon these elements are</font>

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,349
subjective and this could quite possibly

73
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:41,390
be the reason why there is a need for

74
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,700
voting or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just missing the</font>

75
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,489
point a decision does have to be made by

76
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:49,220
and we like everyone else are playing by

77
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,140
the rules and are controlled by the same

78
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,150
regulations we're not cheating we're not

79
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,519
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything different it is all fair</font>

80
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,620
but let's look at the competition we

81
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">have entered as this will make it clear</font>

82
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:02,450
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it was expected of us and what</font>

83
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,040
we did expect to the competition<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

84
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">equate from the BBC upstage website of</font>

85
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:10,670
what is up stage it says and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

86
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite it to be part of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> upstage wanna be</font>

87
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,040
contenders must make a profile of

88
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,049
themselves online including a

89
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:20,239
description and video<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their acts or</font>

90
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,030
idea have you got a hidden talent or

91
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,739
special skill have you got a brilliant

92
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:27,680
idea or amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> invention remember it's</font>

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,280
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a stage it could be a value a</font>

94
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,269
space or a platform whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it</font>

95
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:37,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be we're not just looking for</font>

96
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:40,190
performers either but I'd is an event

97
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that not only attract an audience but</font>

98
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,940
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> them interested the whole event</font>

99
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,680
will last up to eight hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the</font>

100
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,000
contenders were already performed for

101
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,669
six so already you know it's not

102
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:52,419
narrowly about who has the most talent

103
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:55,069
to get specific on the act that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

104
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,470
currently under fire that's right us I

105
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,510
will not only quote from the upstage

106
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,549
website itself but what was presented to

107
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:03,889
us beforehand when we were asked by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

108
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:06,230
BBC to enter the competition yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

109
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,750
right the BBC approached<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and asked us</font>

110
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,370
to be in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> competition as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as the</font>

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,380
other vloggers just before<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas in</font>

112

113
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking because they know that we appeal</font>

we offer through our<font color="#E5E5E5"> vlogs and live</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet this show is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all about the</font>

120

internet with the BBC attempted to

combine the<font color="#CCCCCC"> elements of television and</font>

two mediums have ever been brought

together on such a large scale and

127
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,600
therefore it is a journey<font color="#E5E5E5"> of true</font>

128
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,590
discovery on our first day<font color="#CCCCCC"> after the</font>

129
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,240
vlogger team had met for the first time

130
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,580
we recognize that things didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go great</font>

131
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,440
something we admitted there and

<font color="#E5E5E5">something we admit now but something we</font>

133
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,669
also admitted is we did improve over the

00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:04,100
four days and this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> forever shown by</font>

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,900
feedback if as said by some that we

137
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,639
haven't been entertaining and we only

138
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,100
want due to a fan base this suggests we

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are to truly deal with the issue of</font>

how talent is subjective remember that

145
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:28,550
people did vote regularly because they

146
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,260
kept watching the show and therefore

147
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,440
they were entertained if they won are

would have kept<font color="#CCCCCC"> going with the voting</font>

sake of winning that<font color="#CCCCCC"> my friends is a</font>

157
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,340
true question of integrity<font color="#E5E5E5"> and forms a</font>

158
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,320
whole new argument I for one<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

159
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,639
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> question the integrity of</font>

160
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,889
every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> person who supported us nor</font>

161
00:05:57,889 --> 00:05:59,750
will I for those that are against us

162
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,300
this is a competition<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with the rules</font>

163
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,180
being kept to buy all acts it is

164
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,729
officially fair fairness<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a huge issue</font>

165
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:09,800
addressed by people that do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not like the</font>

166
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,020
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> we took the competition by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> storm so</font>

167
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,510
far and once again there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many levels</font>

168
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,510
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this the overall view is that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

169
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,699
an unfair advantage because we have a

170
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,010
huge internet following I'm sorry to

171
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">break it to you but this is an online</font>

172

competition you have to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

criteria when applying for a competition

and you go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if you feel you have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it takes I mean you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

177
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:35,449

<font color="#CCCCCC">planing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was unfair because the</font>

guessed it more adapt to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> competition</font>

181
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,039
of long-distance running if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are to</font>

182
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,719
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the support we have though this</font>

183
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:49,460
is support that didn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall out of</font>

184
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,159
the sky this has been earned and is

185
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,779
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> available to anyone who has</font>

186
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:55,249
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with the show I</font>

187
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,900
personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been vlogging for almost</font>

188
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,300
two years now and I've built up the fan

189
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,370
base<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I have but wait are you</font>

190
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,189
telling me musicians comedians artists

191
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:06,110
performers were only allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build up</font>

192
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,400
a fan base when the competition<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

193
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,430
announced surely not some acts who are

194
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,629
being against have been together<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

195
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:14,089
over two years is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that unfair so i can</font>

196
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:15,889
test that they've had longer to build up

197
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:18,770
as a fan<font color="#E5E5E5"> base more than me if we had</font>

198
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,050
have applied for such a show two years

199
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago would we have had an a disadvantage</font>

200
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,210
well sure but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm afraid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to break it to</font>

201
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,339
you but life doesn't exist in a timely

202
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:32,330
convenient fashion for everyone it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

203
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,699
absurd that such a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment is thrown our</font>

204
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:36,499
way because a big part of entertaining

205
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,960
is having a passion for what you do the

206
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,430
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nine thousand</font>

207
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,439
subscribers alone isn't just so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can go</font>

208
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:44,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">on TV and kill off the competition as</font>

209
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,039
some people put it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I've</font>

210
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:47,330
always been passionate for what I've

211
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,819
done and I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> enjoyed the ride and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

212
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:51,439
is the matter if I wish to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it on a</font>

213
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,089
new platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> which gives me that</font>

214
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:55,279
opportunity if we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the basis on</font>

215
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,110
talent we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to avoid ignorance</font>

216
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,939
assuming that talent is all that it

217
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:01,479
comes down to the website says promote

218
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:03,279
entertainment suggest having an audience

219
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,839
let's take the metaphor of the tree

220
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,249
falling down in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> woods everyone's</font>

221
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:08,479
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that but apply it to this</font>

222
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,419
context so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it this way if a</font>

223
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:13,959
comedian tells the world's best joke

224
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,759
internet in an empty<font color="#E5E5E5"> home how many</font>

225
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:19,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">people will experience the tongue as</font>

226
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:21,289
much as we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make those behind us</font>

227
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:24,620
already proud we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this to get</font>

228
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,419
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on board with this internet</font>

229
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:28,009
experience that has enhanced our lives

230
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,169
completely and we have already<font color="#E5E5E5"> succeeded</font>

231
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:33,049
with new people who've walked past the

232
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,789
box and<font color="#CCCCCC"> who've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been just watching online</font>

233
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,099
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started vlogging and that's</font>

234
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,630
an amazing thing we've achieved what

235
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,659
we've done even if it's just one person

236
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,230
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are succeeding on so many different</font>

237
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,430
but then the question is what is success

238
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,730
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that again is another video so we</font>

239
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,620
are accused by some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of being boring a</font>

240
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,260
disgrace<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the competition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worse than</font>

241
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,960
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> paint dry then you should put</font>

242
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,790
all your efforts in supporting the other

243
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,220
teams that we face<font color="#CCCCCC"> because if you wanted</font>

244
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,470
to create a solution to such injustice

245
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,050
you should be constructive and support

246
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,839
the acts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a quote I</font>

247
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,550
hold close to my heart of the much

248
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,860
experience of scrutiny and criticism for

249
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">what I've done over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the past couple</font>

250
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,970
years is you can please some people some

251
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,890
of the time but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't please all</font>

252
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,520
people all the time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some it</font>

253
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,380
may be boring for some people but not

254
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,960
for those that are voting and let me

255
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">remind you this competition is decided</font>

256
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,720
on vase so just like how society works

257
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,790
in everyday life how life works in

258
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,040
democracies the<font color="#CCCCCC"> majority that can be</font>

259
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,980
bothered<font color="#CCCCCC"> to act make ultimate decisions</font>

260
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,110
it's been said that we have just been

261
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,870
playing games and acting<font color="#E5E5E5"> like children</font>

262
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,820
once again or in total to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their opinion</font>

263
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,680
but let me remind you that some of the

264
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,570
most popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows on TV and radio have</font>

265
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,820
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> constructed of such such as panel</font>

266
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,980
shows and programs like whose line<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font>

267
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,570
anyway or give us a clue just a minute

268
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,800
this is an online show for the online

269
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">community and we are playing along with</font>

270
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,360
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something new and</font>

271
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,370
radical we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> competing against</font>

272
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,680
traditional entertainment necks and it's

273
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,270
therefore not surprising that there is a

274
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,160
clash of cultures we are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

275
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,900
traditional<font color="#CCCCCC"> at we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to be</font>

276
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,670
ourselves having a good time taking on

277
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,830
board criticism when constructive and

278
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,050
trying to work with all viewers to make

279
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,170
this as entertaining as possible we have

280
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,180
six weeks until we return and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we</font>

281
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,680
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an understanding of how this show</font>

282
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,470
works and what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about us</font>

283
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,540
outside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box literally and</font>

284
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,940
metaphorically we look<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward to</font>

285
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting whatever the competition has to</font>

286
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,440
press in terms of performance and not as

287
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,020
a critical perspective we hope to<font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font>

288
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,370
you in what we have yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show as</font>

289
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,990
individuals we demonstrate our abilities

290
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,180
to connect with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and our team is a</font>

291
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,450
testament to that 400 people in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chat</font>

292
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:53,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">room</font>

293
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,960
one time having feedback from people

294
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,780
engaged from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Canada Australia</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the USA</font>

295
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,200
mexico germany holland and many others

296
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,750
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply on these appeal on a</font>

297
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,540
global scale it's not surprising how

298
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,060
scary this is to some people even to us

299
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,840
and more so as an intimidating aspect to

300
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,850
this competition to our competitors and

301
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,370
this is why the creation of frustration

302
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,530
occurs to those that do not like our act

303
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,930
I mean it's understandable if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

304
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,090
like an act and you wonder why they keep

305
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,400
winning and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do not like our act</font>

306
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,050
and think it's a disgrace we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> won</font>

307
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,690
the way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have so far I will let you</font>

308
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first irrational belief is</font>

309
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,520
that life is fair and that's only if I

310
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,200
were to agree view with your argument

311
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,600
about unfairness because as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I stated</font>

312
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,730
before in terms of rules and how the

313
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,590
show has been set up we are winning

314
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,160
fairly just by a huge margin if people

315
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,840
criticize us and say certain aspects

316
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel good but the general thing was</font>

317
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,990
rubbish then you've already proven the

318
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,880
point that not all things are liked by

319
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,490
all people some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people get it and some</font>

320
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,950
people just don't that's how life<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font>

321
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,870
could be said that we are great online

322
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,360
but not in a box as some people have

323
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,630
said but I'm sorry to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you that the</font>

324
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,720
box was actually broadcasted online when

325
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,670
people throw us comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are</font>

326
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,580
talentless it does get to us it does you

327
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,650
know I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be honest and I know it gets</font>

328
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,690
to the others because in an ideal world

329
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,660
we would love to entertain everyone but

330
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,520
we just can't we all have different

331
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,650
tastes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we can do is take on</font>

332
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,510
constructive criticisms that involve

333
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,490
comments such as this is what you should

334
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,830
do and work on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve our niche</font>

335
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,990
whilst not compromising what we are

336
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,690
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do from the start the fact we</font>

337
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,640
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> prompted a huge response of people</font>

338
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,230
to make critical video responses and

339
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,940
feedback to our show can surely

340
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,170
demonstrate a great deal of

341
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,240
entertainment perhaps because at the end

342
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,340
of the day we all like drama don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait</font>

343
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,440
there is so much that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be said but</font>

344
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,330
with these points per<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ford as the court</font>

345
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,680
defense to those that say we have no

346
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">talent and that we have an unfair</font>

347
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,330
advantage I hope you are open-minded to

348
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,980
understand that this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

349
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,440
and with it being a competition you

350
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,910
should strive to help how those

351
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,560
if you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> support when they take</font>

352
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,410
the stage finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd just like to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

353
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,820
big thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> support we</font>

354
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,860
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had across the board as without it</font>

355
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,410
we would not be aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how I act is</font>

356
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,780
truly going winning this competition is

357
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,130
only a midpoint of what we wish to

358
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">achieve and what would it be worth with</font>

359
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,120
we won<font color="#CCCCCC"> upstage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> without having achieved</font>

360
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,710
the real goals that we had originally

361
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">gone into the box to do you know</font>

362
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,510
representing community and showing how

363
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,150
it brings people<font color="#E5E5E5"> together and how the</font>

364
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,390
internet is an amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

365
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,310
finally if huge thanks to Chris Cohen

366
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,440
and the high flyers because in my

367
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,320
opinion for<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it's worth the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

368
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,330
talented of our competitors were then

369
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,550
and interestingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough the most</font>

370
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">gracious in defeat thank you and a th</font>

00:13:49,180 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">till</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next time</font>
