Some day
When im awfully low
 
when the world is cold
i will feel a glow just
thinking of you
and the way you look
tonight
oh but your love
-ly
with your smile so warm
and your cheeks so soft
there is nothing
for me but to love you
 
just the way you look
 
tonight
 
with each word
your tendornes grows
tearing my fear apart
and that laugh
that wrinkles your nose
touches my foolish
heart
lovely
dont you ever change
 
keep
that breathless charm
wont you please arrange
it
cause i love you
and the way you look
tonight
and that laugh that wrinkles your nose
touches my foolish heart
lovely dont you ever change
keep that breathless charm
wont you please arrange it
cause i love
you
just the way you look
tonight
just the
way you look
tonight
