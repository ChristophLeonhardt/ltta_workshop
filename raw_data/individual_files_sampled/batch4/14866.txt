I have an old town Warsaw and they have a street festival going on where they have children dressed in traditional clothing doing traditional dance and it's so nice to see because we tend to not really have that in America no one really does the neat traditional dancing you just see people dancing to Beyonce or something and in the UK they actually discourage traditional dancing they call it racist they say all sorts of stuff about it and it's just dying out they really don't like traditional dance there it's so nice to see traditional dance being embracing young kids doing these traditional dances really embracing their culture and their heritage the costuming is amazing the music is so nice and it's so nice to see young people really embracing their culture and as you can see this little festival that's going on right now it's a Sunday people are going to mass they're in church and they started implementing laws to shut down stores on Sunday so that people can spend time with their families and this is exactly what's going on everyone's out there interacting with each other they're dancing it's so nice to see this is the type of things that we need to see in the West more often and I'm so glad Poland is doing it I'm Martina Marco de with rebel dot media if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
