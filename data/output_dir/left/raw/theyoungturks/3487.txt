00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">you remember of course when Donald Trump</font>

captured now of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course he said that</font>

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,390
with the convenience<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having avoided</font>

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Vietnam draft</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and in fact that's</font>
