US.
>> Tucker: THANK YOU FOR THAT,
I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON
THIS.
>> I ENJOY IT, IT'S ALWAYS FUN.
>> Tucker: MIKE PENN WAS FOR
MANY YEARS ONE OF THE HIGHEST
ADVISORS TO HILLARY CLINTON.
MARK, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.
>> Mark: THANK YOU.
>> Tucker: YOU WROTE AN
AMAZING PIECE THE OTHER DAY AND
THE HILL, TITLED SOMETHING LIKE,
QUESTIONS I HAVE FOR ROBERT
MUELLER.
TELL US SOME OF THE QUESTIONS
THAT YOU HAVE.
>> Mark: REMEMBER I SPENT A
YEAR WORKING FOR
PRESIDENT CLINTON AGAINST KEN
STARR AND THAT.
I FOUND THAT WAS CHILD'S PLAY
COMPARED TO WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE.
I FOUND MUELLER HAS SOME
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE
PRESIDENT WAS THINKING WHEN HE
FIRED CALL ME, BUT I CERTAINLY
HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HE WAS
THINKING WHEN HE FIRST WENT TO
APPLY FOR THE FBI JOB IN THE
FIRST PLACE WITH ROSENSTEIN, AND
THEN TURNS AROUND THE NEXT DAY.
WHEN HE PUT THAT TEAM TOGETHER,
AND THERE WASN'T A SINGLE
TRUMPED OWNER, WHAT WAS HE
THINKING THEN?
WHEN HE LOOKED AT THESE DOSSIERS
AND DISCOVERED THERE WAS NO
FOUNDATION THERE, HOW DID HE
DEAL WITH THAT, AND HOW DOES HE
JUSTIFY THESE KINDS OF REALLY
STORMTROOPER TACTICS, WHICH IS
PERHAPS NOT AN EXAGGERATION WHEN
YOU GO GUNS DRAWN AND POLITICAL
ENACTMENTS.
WHILE HE WANTS TO QUESTION THE
PRESIDENT, IT SEEMS THAT NO ONE
COULD REALLY QUESTION EITHER
MUELLER OR CALL ME OR
ROSENSTEIN, WHICH IS PRECISELY
THE PROBLEM.
>> I HATE TO ADMIT IT SINCE I
SUPPORTED THE KEN STARR
INDEPENDENT COUNSEL
INVESTIGATION, AND I LOOK BACK
AND SHAME BECAUSE OF THAT.
BUT THAT WAS THE CASE THE
CLINTON PEOPLE MADE AT THE TIME,
THERE IS NO OVERSIGHT THERE.
IN YOUR PIECE YOU MADE REFERENCE
TO HIS BEHAVIOR IN BOSTON WHEN
HE WORKED THERE.
BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THAT IF YOU
WOULD, I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY
INTERESTING.
>> Mark: REALLY THE QUESTION,
AND I THINK PROFESSOR DERSHOWITZ
HAS BEEN OUT ON THIS THING, BUT
IN THAT CASE THERE WERE FOUR
INNOCENT PEOPLE IN JAIL DUE TO
PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT.
AND HE WAS HEAD OF THE OFFICE.
AND, YOU DON'T REALLY FIND HIM
IN THE LEGAL CASES BUT HE WAITED
UNTIL THE COURTS OVERTURNED
THINGS TO RELEASE THE PEOPLE.
SO WHAT WAS HE THINKING WHEN
THAT WAS HAPPENING?
HOW DID HE PERMIT THAT, HOW DID
HE PERMIT THOSE KIND OF GROSS
ABUSES, AND HOW DOES HE THEN
SUPERVISE AN INVESTIGATION NOW
THAT SEEMS TO BE FILLED WITH
THEM.
>>  >> Tucker: WILL THANKS FOR
