FOXES WERE FROM THAILAND. SUCCESSFULLY RESCUED IN THE TOTAL DARKNESS. THE MISSION TO SAVE THE REMAINING YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR SOCCER COACH EXPECTED TO RESUME LATER TODAY. ARTHEL: THE FOUR BOYS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO HOSPITAL WHERE THEY ARE RECOVERING FROM A TWO-WEEK APOLOGIST AND CONTRIBUTOR, VERY GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING. WE'LL GET YOU THE EFFECTS OF THE BOYS. WHAT WILL THEY BE CHECKING FOR AND WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO IN FOR DEHYDRATION, LOSS OF WEIGHT, OXYGEN LEVELS, ALL OF WHICH CAN BE CORRECTED VERY EASILY. THEY WILL ALSO BE CHECKING FOR INFECTIONS BECAUSE THE THEY IODINE ON THE SOLES OF SEED BECAUSE THESE KIDS CAN HAVE BRUISES AND CUTS ON THEIR FEET FROM WALKING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY AND THERE MAY BE BUGS DOWN THERE THAT ARE MORE INFECTIOUS THAN THE ONES WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO. THEY WILL BE CHECKING FOR MOST YOUNG KIDS LIKE THIS WHO'S CAVE AND APPEAR TO BE ACTING APPROPRIATELY FROM THE VIDEOS WE HAVE SEEN RESPOND VERY WELL. SUPPORT IN ADDITION TO THEIR FAMILIES. SO THE OUTLOOK I THINK IS VERY PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. ARTHEL: NOW WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ONE STILL LEFT THERE. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OXYGEN LEVELS. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT OVER. KIDS AGED 12 TO 16 FEET LIKE WEEDS BECAUSE THEY ARE GROWING. WHAT IS THE IMPACT IS THE CRITICAL PART RIGHT NOW. IN THE TRILLION 2010 DISASTER WHERE THEY HAD 33 MINERS CAN FIND FOR 69 DAYS. THEY WOULD PUT OXYGEN DOWN. WHEN IT GOES BELOW 19%, AND THEY START TO GET WOOZY BECAUSE THE BRAIN USES UP ABOUT 25% OF THE OXYGEN WE ARE BRINGING IN. THE LOWER OXYGEN IS THE BRAIN THAT GETS IT. IF IT GETS DOWN TO 15%, WHICH IS WHAT THEY ARE STATED SO FAR IN THE ENVIRONMENT, THE PERSON CAN BECOME VERY DISORIENTED AND UNABLE TO MOVE PROPERLY WHICH IS INCREASINGLY MORE IMPORTANT TO RESCUE THEM. AND IF IT GETS BELOW 10%, DEATH CAN OCCUR WITHIN CONSCIOUSNESS, CONVULSIONS ALL BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF OXYGEN. THEY COULDN'T DO IT THE WAY THEY DID IT, AND THE OXYGEN IS JUST BEING USED UP. IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A NARROW BRING IN OXYGEN TANKS FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THEY ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY. ARTHEL: GIVEN THOSE MADE FOR HIRE OXYGEN LEVELS, HOW MUCH TIME DO THEY HAVE COME INTO THE RESCUERS HAVE TWO GET THE VOICE TO SAFETY WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THEIR BRAIN. MATZO PHYSICAL AS WELL AS EMOTIONAL. THAT IS TRICKY. THEY SAID THEY BEEN ABLE TO NOW IT'S RAINING AND THEY CAN'T STOP WATER FROM COMING IN FROM ALL DIFFERENT SIDES AND RAISING THE LEVELS. THEY HAVE JUST A FEW DAYS TO BE ABLE TO GET AROUND SAFELY. IF IT WILL WORK. IT IS 11 TO 16-YEAR-OLD IN THE 11-YEAR-OLDS ARE IN THE MOST JEOPARDY. WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE GUYS LEFT BEHIND IN TERMS OF FINDING OUT THAT THEY'RE A TEAM THAT'S COMING IN AND OUT SAFELY. THAT IS A HUGE LIFT IN THE COMMUNICATIONS IS A HUGE LIFT AND THAT MEANS THEY CAN DO IT. SO THAT'S A GREAT IMPACT. THE EMOTIONAL TOLL, LOOKS LIKE THE SCOUT, THE GUY IN CHARGE HAS HANDLED THEM VERY NICELY WHILE THEY WERE CONFINED FOR 10 DAYS UNTIL THEY WERE RESCUED. HE ALSO IS THE ONE WHO'S MOST AT RISK FOR EMOTIONAL ISSUES AND PTSD. ARTHEL: BECAUSE HE ALSO BROUGHT THEM THERE. AND IS APPARENTLY GIVEN OVER A LOT OF THIS FOOD AND THINGS TO SAID YOU THINK THEY GOT THE STRONGER BOYS OUT FIRST TO SEE IF IT WORKS. IS THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE STRONG STRONG ENOUGH NOT TO PANIC. START PANICKING, EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN IN YOU. THAT IS WHY PEOPLE DROWN IN THE OPENING. PEOPLE WHO SUDDENLY CAN'T SWIM QUITE WELL AND THEY PANIC WHEN THE RESCUERS COME AND THEY CAN PULL THE RESCUERS DOWN. IT WOULD PUT THE DIAPERS AT RISK ALSO. THEY START PANICKING BECAUSE AT A MOMENT IN TIME WHEN THE MASK ISN'T WORKING WHEN THEY ARE SQUEEZING THROUGH A PASSAGE OR SOMETHING. IT IS A DANGER FOR BOTH THE KIDS IN THE RESCUERS. ARTHEL: ANYTHING WE HAVE A NASTY THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT? JUST THE APPRECIATION COME IN THE IMPORTANCE OF OXYGEN. WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT 21%. IF IT GOES LOWER THAN NOT, THE PERSON GETS CONFUSED, HALLUCINATING AND DOESN'T FUNCTION IN A WAY THAT'S HELPFUL. STILL LIKE ALL OF US FROM A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE YOU REMAIN HOPEFUL. HOPEFULLY ONCE THEY GET OUT THOUGH BE PHYSICALLY OKAY.
