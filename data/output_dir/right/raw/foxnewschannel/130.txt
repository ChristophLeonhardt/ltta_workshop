REPUBLICANS HEADING INTO THE

8
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,142

00:00:23,487 --> 00:00:24,420
DEMOCRATS WON'T APPROVE

17
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:25,688
LEGISLATION THAT WILL ALLOW

18
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:27,557
LAWS FOR PROTECTION OF OUR

19
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:27,890

THE CARAVAN.

30
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:42,872
THERE WAS ALREADY A SURGE AT

31
00:00:42,873 --> 00:00:43,273
THE BORDER.

32
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:43,740
>> YEAH.

33
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:45,074
THE NUMBERS ARE UP ON FAMILY

34
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:45,508

38
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:51,514
AS ICE DIRECTOR I WENT TO

40
00:00:52,816 --> 00:00:54,517
LAWMAKERS ABOUT CLOSING

00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:57,153
TWO BIGGEST LOOPHOLES IS

00:00:58,422 --> 00:01:00,456
JUST GOT TO SAY A COUPLE

45
00:01:00,457 --> 00:01:02,358
MAGIC WORDS THAT THE

46
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,326
CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS TEACH

00:01:03,327 --> 00:01:04,460

00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:13,870
CAN'T DETAIN FAMILIES MORE

53
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:14,671
THAN 20 DAYS NOT QUICK

54
00:01:14,672 --> 00:01:16,706
ENOUGH TO SEE A JUDGE NO.

55
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:17,940
CONSEQUENCES, NO DETERRENCE.

56
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:19,208
GET IN AND GET RELEASED

57
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,110
NEVER SHOW UP IN COURT WHY

58
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:23,179
WOULDN'T THEY STOP COMING?

59
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,013
AINSLEY: BRING MORE JUDGES

60
00:01:24,014 --> 00:01:26,082

61
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,317
>> HIRING A LOT OF JUDGES.

62
00:01:27,318 --> 00:01:29,052
THIS ISSUE, THIS CARAVAN

63
00:01:29,053 --> 00:01:30,286
ISSUE LAYS AT THE FEET OF

64
00:01:30,287 --> 00:01:31,287
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY UP ON

65
00:01:31,288 --> 00:01:32,288
THE HILL.

66
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:34,924
LIKE I SAID, THEY HAVE BEEN

67
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:35,958
EDUCATED WHAT THESE

68
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,526
LOOPHOLES ARE.

69
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:38,261
THEY DON'T WANT TO CLOSE THE

70
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:38,628
LOOPHOLES.

71
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:39,395
THEY WANT THE PRESIDENT TO

72
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:40,596
HAVE A FAIL ON THEIR.

73
00:01:40,597 --> 00:01:41,531
I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

74
00:01:41,532 --> 00:01:43,132
ARE PAYING ATTENTION.

75
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:44,167
THIS ISN'T THE PRESIDENT'S

76
00:01:44,168 --> 00:01:44,667
FAILURE.

77
00:01:44,668 --> 00:01:45,968
THIS ISN'T THE SECRETARY'S

78
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:46,302
FAILURE.

79
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:47,337
THIS IS THE DEMOCRATS'

80
00:01:47,338 --> 00:01:47,670
FAILURE.

81
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:49,072
THEY KNOW THE ISSUE AND THEY

82
00:01:49,073 --> 00:01:50,206
REFUSE TO FIX IT.

83
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:51,974
THEY ARE PUTTING THEIR

84
00:01:51,975 --> 00:01:53,343
POLITICAL AMBITIONS AHEAD OF

85
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:54,110
PUBLIC SAFETY, NATIONAL

86
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:54,677
SECURITY, AND BORDER

87
00:01:54,678 --> 00:01:55,645
CONTROL.

88
00:01:55,646 --> 00:01:57,380
SIMPLE AS THAT.

89
00:01:57,381 --> 00:01:58,748
STEVE: YOU KNOW, TOM, BACK

90
00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:00,049

AND MEXICO AND SAID IF YOU

00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:08,591

00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:10,059

98
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,993
HERE, WE ARE GOING TO CUT

99
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:11,728

100
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:13,229
HE NEVER REALLY FOLLOWED

101
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:13,796
THROUGH ON THAT.

102
00:02:13,797 --> 00:02:15,131
AND NOW THOSE PEOPLE, SOME

103
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:16,833
OF THE PEOPLE WOUND UP

104
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:17,667
EVENTUALLY GETTING TO THE

105
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:19,135
BORDER AND SEEKING ASYLUM.

106
00:02:19,136 --> 00:02:20,269
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

107
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,970
HAPPENED TO THEM.

108
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:22,138
WE ARE AT THE SAME PLACE

109
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:22,805
RIGHT NOW.

110
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:24,607
WE ARE DEPENDING ON MEXICO

111
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:25,608
TO ACTUALLY ENFORCE THEIR

112
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:26,776
SOUTHERN BORDER AND THEY SAY

113
00:02:26,777 --> 00:02:28,144
OKAY, WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET

114
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:29,645
ANYBODY ACROSS WITHOUT A

115
00:02:29,646 --> 00:02:30,012
PASSPORT.

116
00:02:30,013 --> 00:02:31,581
NONE OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE

117
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:31,948
PASSPORTS.

118
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:32,315
>> RIGHT.

119
00:02:32,316 --> 00:02:34,283
THE LAW IS CLEAR THAT IN

120
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:35,051
MEXICO PEOPLE IN CENTRAL

121
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:36,853
AMERICA CANNOT TRANSIT

122
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:39,589
THROUGH MEXICO WITHOUT WHAT

123
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,691
WE CALL TRANSIT VISA.

124
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:42,859
THEY CAN STOP THEM AT THE

125
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,559
SOUTHERN BORDER AND TURN

126
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,728
AROUND OR LET THEM APPLY FOR

127
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:46,763
ASYLUM IN MEXICO.

128
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:48,264
IF THESE PEOPLE ARE REALLY

129
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:49,665
ESCAPING FEAR AND

130
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,933
PERSECUTION IN HONDURAS

131
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:52,135
WHERE THEY ALREADY WENT

132
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:52,668
THROUGH GUATEMALA.

133
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:53,770
THEY ARE GETTING TO MEXICO.

134
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:54,704
THEY DON'T NEED TO GET TO

135
00:02:54,705 --> 00:02:55,338
THE UNITED STATES.

136
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:57,173
THIS ISN'T REALLY ABOUT

137
00:02:57,174 --> 00:02:58,107
ESCAPING FEAR AND

138
00:02:58,108 --> 00:02:58,508
PERSECUTION.

139
00:02:58,509 --> 00:02:59,909
THIS IS ABOUT GETTING TO THE

140
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,910
UNITED STATES AND TAKING

141
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:01,911
ADVANTAGE OF THE LOOPHOLES

142
00:03:01,912 --> 00:03:02,578
IN THE SYSTEM.

143
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:03,746
LET ME ADD ONE MORE THING.

144
00:03:03,747 --> 00:03:05,314
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS

145
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:06,682
ON THE FAMILIES THAT ARE

146
00:03:06,683 --> 00:03:08,651
CLAIMING FEAR AND

147
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:09,652
PERSECUTION, 8 OUT OF THE 10

148
00:03:09,653 --> 00:03:10,953
LOSE THEIR CASES WHEN THEY

149
00:03:10,954 --> 00:03:12,255
FINALLY GET TO IMMIGRATION

150
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,555
COURT.

151
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:13,256
THIS IS FRAUD.

152
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:15,224
THIS IS JUST FRIVOLOUS

153
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:15,591
FRAUD.

154
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:16,392
BRIAN: THE WORD IS OUT THAT

155
00:03:16,393 --> 00:03:17,660
CATCH AND RELEASE IS STILL

157
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:19,862
PRESIDENT'S PUSH.

158
00:03:19,863 --> 00:03:21,531
GETTING ANKLE BRACELETS AND

159
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:22,865
GETTING LET OUT INTO THE

160
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:23,199
COUNTRY.

161
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,866
THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE

162
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:24,567
SEPARATION OF FAMILIES,

163
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:26,169
WHICH WAS POORLY EXECUTED

164
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,171
AND INTRODUCED WAS SUPPOSED

165
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:29,439
TO BE ABOUT.

166
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,306
A DETERRENT.

167
00:03:30,307 --> 00:03:31,741
WASN'T TO BREAK UP FAMILIES.

168
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:33,009
LET THEM KNOW THAT'S NOT THE

169
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,011
WAY TO GET HERE.

170
00:03:35,012 --> 00:03:37,246
MEXICO IS RESPONSE WE ARE

174
00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:42,618
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS

175
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:43,886
ADMINISTRATION, THE NEW ONE,

176
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:45,455

179
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:49,625
BORDER, WHEN THEY BUSTED

180
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:50,393
GUATEMALA'S BORDER?

181
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:51,961
>> LOOK, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

182
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:53,463
A WARRIOR WHEN IT COMES TO

183
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:55,031
BORDER SECURITY AND

184
00:03:55,032 --> 00:03:56,699
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT.

185
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,700
WE COULDN'T HAVE A BETTER

186
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:58,801
PRESIDENT THAN WE HAVE RIGHT

187
00:03:58,802 --> 00:03:59,068

188
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:00,736
THIS MAN HAS THE BACKS OF

189
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:02,305
THE BORDER PATROL AND ICE.

190
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:03,539
THIS MAN BELIEVES IN BORDER

191
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:03,906
SECURITY.

192
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:05,007
THAT'S WHY EVERYBODY,

193
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:06,709
REGARDLESS OF REPUBLICAN,

194
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,710
DEMOCRAT, THERE IS NO

195
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:10,179
DOWNSIDE IN SECURING THE

196
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,580
BORDER.

197
00:04:10,581 --> 00:04:11,447
BRIAN: I SHOULD BE CLEAR,

198
00:04:11,448 --> 00:04:13,082
TOM, I WANT TO KNOW IF

199
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,450
MEXICO IS GOING TO REINFORCE

200
00:04:14,451 --> 00:04:15,485
THEIR BORDER SO THEY DON'T

201
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:19,355
GET TO OUR BORDER?

202
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:21,123
I THINK MEXICO WILL HELP.

203
00:04:21,124 --> 00:04:21,557
I REALLY DO.

204
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:22,358
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

205
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:23,493
CATCH AND RELEASE, BRIAN,

206
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:24,627
THIS IS ANOTHER FAILURE OF

207
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:26,929
CONGRESS THAT NO ONE IS

208
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,497
TALKING ABOUT.

209
00:04:27,498 --> 00:04:28,865
ICE JUSTIFIED THE NEED FOR

210
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:30,600
FUNDING FOR 51,000 BEDS.

211
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:31,934
CONGRESS WANTS TO GIVE THEM

212
00:04:31,935 --> 00:04:32,268
40,000.

213
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:34,270
PEOPLE ARE BEING RELEASED

214
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:35,271
BECAUSE ICE HASN'T BEEN

215
00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:42,345
PROPERLY FUNDED EITHER.

216
00:04:42,346 --> 00:04:43,079
ANOTHER FAILURE.

217
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,413
NO ONE WANTS TO SEE FAMILIES

218
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:46,816
SEPARATED BUT WHEN THEY

219
00:04:46,817 --> 00:04:47,550
SEPARATED THOSE PEOPLE CROSS

220
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:49,285
INTO THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY

221
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:51,053
NUMBERS WENT DOWN 22% IN TWO

222
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:51,354
WEEKS.

223
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:52,221
IF THEY WOULD HAVE STUCK

224
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:54,190
WITH THAT FOR 30, 60 DAYS

225
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:56,025
THERE WOULDN'T BE A CARAVAN

226
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:56,392
TODAY.

227
00:04:56,393 --> 00:00:00,000
STEVE: NEWT GINGRICH SAID
