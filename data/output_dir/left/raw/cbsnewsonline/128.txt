1
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,838
HELSINKI YESTERDAY WITH 

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:05,105
MELANIA. 

3
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:06,840
HE SPOKE ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS 

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,440
FROM THE MEETING. 

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,275
>> Reporter: WHAT'S YOUR GOAL 

6
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:10,075
FROM THE PUTIN MEETING? 

7
00:00:10,075 --> 00:00:13,313
>> I WILL LET YOU KNOW AFTER 

8
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:13,680
THE MEETING. 

9
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,048
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY -- IT WAS 

10
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,583
MUTUALLY AGREED, LET'S HAVE A 

11
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:16,850
MEETING. 

12
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,052
I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING TO 

13
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:19,252
MEET. 

14
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,087
I BELIEVE IN MEETINGS, AND 

15
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,455
LOOK, I BELIEVE HAVING A 

16
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,591
MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN KIM WAS A 

17
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,560
GOOD THING, AND I THINK HAVING 

18
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,795
MEETINGS WITH THE PRESIDENT OF 

19
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,329
CHINA WAS A VERY GOOD THING. 

20
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:32,899
I BELIEVE IT'S GOOD. 

21
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,502
HAVING MEETINGS WITH RUSSIA, 

22
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:36,903
CHINA, NORTH KOREA, I BELIEVE 

23
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:37,170
IN IT. 

24
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,738
NOTHING BAD WILL COME OUT OF 

25
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,440
IT, AND MAYBE SOME GOOD WILL 

26
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:40,907
COME OUT. 

27
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,842
I GO IN WITH LOW EXPECTATIONS. 

28
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:45,678
I'M NOT GOING IN WITH HIGH 

29
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:46,011
EXPECTATIONS. 

30
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:47,113
I DON'T REALLY -- I CAN'T TELL 

31
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,380
YOU WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, 

32
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,750
BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT I WILL 

33
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,418
BE ASKING FOR, AND WE WILL SEE 

34
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:53,686
IF SOMETHING COMES FOR IT. 

35
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,255
>> Reporter: THE RUSSIANS WHO 

36
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,490
WERE INDICTED, WOULD YOU ASK 

37
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,825
PUTIN TO SEND THEM HERE? 

38
00:00:58,825 --> 00:00:59,892
>> WELL, I MIGHT. 

39
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:01,861
I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT BUT I 

40
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,929
WILL CERTAINLY ASK ABOUT IT. 

41
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:05,098
IT WAS DURING THE OBAMA 

42
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:05,965
ADMINISTRATION, AND THEY WERE 

43
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,800
DOING WHATEVER IT WAS DURING 

44
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,302
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, AND I 

45
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,337
HEARD THAT THEY WERE TRYING, OR 

46
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,873
PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO HACK INTO 

47
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,575
THE RNC, TOO, THE REPUBLICN 

48
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,243
NATIONAL COMMITTEE, BUT WE HAD 

49
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,478
MUCH BETTER DEFENSES, AND I 

50
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,914
HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT BY A NUMBER 

51
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,247
OF PEOPLE. 

52
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,516
WE HAD BETTER DEFENSES, AND 

53
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:24,316
THEY WOULDN'T. 

54
00:01:24,316 --> 00:01:26,119
I THINK THE DNC SHOULD BE 

55
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,487
ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR 

56
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,055
ALLOWING THEMSELVES TO BE 

57
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:29,288
HACKED. 

58
00:01:29,288 --> 00:01:30,390
THEY HAD BAD DEFENSES, AND THEY 

59
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,325
WERE ABLE TO BE HACKED. 

60
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,027
I HEARD THEY WERE TRYING TO 

61
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,528
HACK THE REPUBLICANS, TOO, BUT, 

62
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:40,366
AND THIS MAY BE WRONG, BUT THEY 

63
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,433
HAD MUCH STRONGER DEFENSES. 

64
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:43,770
>> Reporter: LUKE COFFEY FROM 

65
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,139
WASHINGTON, THE DIRECTOR AT THE 

66
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:46,906
CONSERVATIVE HERITAGE CENTER 

67
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:47,673
FOR FOREIGN POLICY. 

68
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:49,275
GOOD TO TALK TO YOU, LUKE. 

69
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,344
>> Reporter: HI, GOOD MORNING. 

70
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:54,280
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOUR 

71
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,982
EXPECTATIONS ARE, YOUR ANALYSIS 

72
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,351
OF THIS MEETING WITH VLADIMIR 

73
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,785
PUTIN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS. 

74
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:01,821
>> WELL, I HAVE VERY LOW 

75
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,790
EXPECTATIONS AS WELL, AND IN 

76
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,091
PRINCIPLE, I THINK IT'S A 

77
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,960
POSITIVE THING THE TWO LEADERS 

78
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,195
ARE MEETING, AND I THINK IT'S 

79
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,663
IMPORTANT IN DIPLOMACY TO HAVE 

80
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,765
HEADS OF STATE, BEING ABLE TO 

81
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,667
MEET WITH ONE ANOTHER FROM TIME 

82
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,236
TO TIME, AND I THINK PRESIDENT 

83
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,870
TRUMP NEEDS TO GO INTO THE 

84
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,906
MEETING WITH HIS EYES OPEN, AND 

85
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,808
PRESIDENT PUTIN HAS BEEN AROUND 

86
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,577
THE BLOCK A FEW TIMES, AND HE'S 

87
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,145
MET THREE DIFFERENT PRESIDENTS, 

88
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,880
BILL CLINTON, BUSH, AND 

89
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,015
PRESIDENT OBAMA IN THE PAST, 

90
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:32,452
AND HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING, 

91
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,820
AND NOTHING SINCE 1999 WHEN 

92
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,388
PRESIDENT PUTIN CAME TO POWER 

93
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,590
FOR THE FIRST TIME SHOWS THAT 

94
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,125
HE CAN ACTUALLY BE A 

95
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,827
TRUSTWORTHY PARTNER FOR THE 

96
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,194
UNITED STATES. 

97
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,261
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT 

98
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:44,897
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP GOES INTO 

99
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:48,634
THIS IN A REALISTIC MANNER. 

100
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:53,373
>> LUKE, IS THERE AIDINGER IN 

101
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,141
-- IS THERE A DANGER IN 

102
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,576
APPROACHING A MEETING LIKE THIS 

103
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:57,610
WITHOUT AN AGENDA? 

104
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,379
>> Reporter: A LOT OF THE 

105
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,282
RHETORIC IS THAT IT'S NOT AS 

106
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:02,582
STRUCTURED. 

107
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:03,916
I THINK THE AMBASSADOR SAID 

108
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,451
IT'S A MEETING NOT AS 

109
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,552
STRUCTURED, BUT THERE'S SOME 

110
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:08,888
STRUCTURE BEHIND IT, AND SOME 

111
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:10,056
SORT OF, AT LEAST INFORMAL 

112
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,958
AGENDA, AND I THINK AT THIS 

113
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,726
POINT, IT'S PROBABLY OKAY, AND 

114
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,262
IT'S GOING TO BE, YOU KNOW, IN 

115
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,597
TERMS OF SUMMITS A SHORTER 

116
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,699
SUMMIT, AND THEY WILL HAVE 

117
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,769
ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF 

118
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,237
TOGETHER, JUST WITH 

119
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,238
TRANSATORS, AND INTERPRETERS, 

120
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,207
AND THEN, PARALLEL TO THAT, 

121
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:32,111
THERE'S ANOTHER MEET BETWEEN 

122
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,413
SECRETARY POMPEO AND HIS 

123
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,348
RUSSIAN COUNTERPART, AND THEN 

124
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,783
AFTER THOSE TWO MEETINGS RUN 

125
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,684
SIDE-BY-SIDE, THERE'S A WORKING 

126
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,786
LUNCH WHERE THE TWO SIDES WILL 

127
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:40,219
GET TOGETHER. 

128
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:45,391
I THINK IN THIS CONTEXT, UNDER 

129
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,526
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, IT'S MORE 

130
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,560
RELAXED, INFORRAL FORMAT THAT 

131
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,093
IS APPROPRIATE. 

132
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:50,430
>> IT'S INTERESTING, THE 

133
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,564
PRESIDENT ALSO SUGGESTED THIS 

134
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,766
MEETING WILL BE, AT LEAST THE 

135
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,835
WAY HE SEES IT, HE ALSO HAS 

136
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:56,836
VERY LOW EXPECTATIONS, BUT 

137
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,405
THERE'S A LOT OF ANALYSIS OUT 

138
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,473
THERE, THAT SUGGESTS, VLADIMIR 

139
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,941
PUTIN AND THE RUSSIANS HAVE 

140
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:05,078
ALREADY GOTTEN A LOT OUT OF 

141
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,279
THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 

142
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,181
UNITED STATES, SUCH AS IT 

143
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:12,752
EXCITES THAT THEY HAVE BEEN 

144
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:25,898
ABLE TO  SHOW THEY HAVE THE 

145
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:26,766
PRESIDENT SUGGESTING RUSSIA BE 

146
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,035
REINSTATED FOR WHAT WOULD BE 

147
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:29,602
THE U8. 

148
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,970
IF YOU'RE THE RUSSIANS, AREN'T 

149
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,005
YOU ALREADY SEEING WHATEVER 

150
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:34,941
THIS IS, IT'S A FORMALITY, A 

151
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,610
LOT OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER 

152
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,345
THE LAST YEAR OR YEAR AND A 

153
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,915
HALF HAS BEEN A WIN THE WAY THE 

154
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:43,315
RUSSIANS SEE IT. 

155
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:45,118
>> Reporter: CERTAINLY SOME OF 

156
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,954
THE RHETORIC FROM THE WHITE 

157
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,722
HOUSE DOES HELP THE RUSSIAN 

158
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,791
NARRATIVE OF THE WEST BEING 

159
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,659
FRACTURED, AND THE WEST BEING 

160
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:54,694
DISUNITED, BUT IF YOU MOVE 

161
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,696
BEYOND THE RHETORIC, PRESIDENT 

162
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:59,031
TRUMP HAS BEEN SURPRISINGLY 

163
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:00,032
TOUGH AGAINST RUSSIA, AND, IN 

164
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:02,802
FACT, I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS 

165
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,670
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PARADOXES OF 

166
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,539
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SO 

167
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:06,739
FAR. 

168
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,307
HE HAS PROBABLY BEEN THE 

169
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:13,846
TOUGHEST PRESIDENT ON RUSSIA, 

170
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:19,819
IN TERMS OF POLICIES, SINCE 

171
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,186
RONALD REAGAN. 

172
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,788
HE HAS PROVIDED ADVANCED 

173
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,257
WEAPONS TO UKRAINE AND GEORGIA, 

174
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,358
SOMETHING THE OBAMA 

175
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,692
ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOT DO FOR 

176
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:29,796
8 YEARS, AND EVEN WITH HIS 

177
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,764
WHINING AND COMPLAINING, AND 

178
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,833
RIGHTFULLY SO, OF EUROPE'S LACK 

179
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,668
OF DEFENSE SPENDING, THE TRUMP 

180
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,969
ADMINISTRATION HAS INCREASED 

181
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,505
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THE U.S. 

182
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,742
SPENDS ON EUROPEAN DEFENSE BY 

183
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,177
40 PERCENT FROM THE OBAMA 

184
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,144
ADMINISTRATION. 

185
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,813
WHILE SOME OF THE RHETORIC IS 

186
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,214
ALARMING, THE ACTUALLY POLICIES 

187
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,515
OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION ARE 

188
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,250
VERY SOUND ON RUSSIA. 

189
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,017
>> WHY USE THE RHETORIC? 

190
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:52,818
>> I DON'T KNOW. 

191
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:54,453
THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION. 

192
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:55,855
I THINK THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

193
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,757
PROBABLY LIKES THE ATTENTION, 

194
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,560
AND IT DRIVES THE NEWS CYCLE, 

195
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,529
AND THE AGENDA, AND HE LIKES TO 

196
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,064
-- HE FANCIES HIMSELF AS A 

197
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,566
GREAT DEAL MAKER, AND HE LIKES 

198
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,434
TO THROW THINGS OUT THERE TO 

199
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,336
SEE WHAT WILL STICK AHEAD OF 

200
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,437
ANY TALKS OR NEGOTIATIONS, AND 

201
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,273
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ARE 

202
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,908
SEEING TODAY, AND, YOU KNOW, 

203
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,044
ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE, THE HEAD 

204
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,013
OF THE NATO SUMMIT, THE OPENING 

205
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,381
STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP 

206
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,184
WAS ON THE GAS PIPELINE, GOING 

207
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,652
DIRECTLY FROM RUSSIA TO 

208
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:27,720
GERMANY, BYPASSING ALL OTHER 

209
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,822
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AND THIS IS 

210
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:30,890
SOMETHING THAT IS CONTROVERSIAL 

211
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,492
ACROSS EUROPE, AND IT'S 

212
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,360
SOMETHING THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN 

213
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,528
TAKES VERY SERIOUSLY AND 

214
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,729
SUPPORTS VERY MUCH, AND HIM 

215
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,264
BLASTING THAT IN THE OPENING 

216
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:42,301
STAGES OF THE NATO SUMMIT WAS 

217
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,170
NOT FOLLOWING THE MOSCOW 

218
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,371
PLAYBOOK AS YOU WOULD EXPECT. 

219
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,773
>> YOU WROTE A PIECE FOR THE 

220
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:48,541
HERITAGE FOUNDATION WEBSITE, 

221
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,377
AND JUST TO SORT OF POINT OUT, 

222
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:56,115
VLAD, YOU KNOW, SORT OF POINTED 

223
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,017
OUT, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION IS 

224
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,085
DEDICATED TO BUILDING A 

225
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,019
CONSERVATIVE PUBLIC POLICY, AND 

226
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,420
WE WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW WHERE 

227
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,222
YOU'RE COMING FROM, BUT IN THE 

228
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,457
PIECE YOU POSTED ON THE 

229
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,826
WEBSITE, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 

230
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,427
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS, OBAMA 

231
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,261
ADMINISTRATION, AND THE BUSH 

232
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:11,464
ADMINISTRATION, AND WHERE DO 

233
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:16,836
YOU THINK THE TWO 

234
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:20,239
ADMINISTRATIONS FAILED? ú>> WEL 

235
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,474
2001, SOON AFTER MEETING PUTIN 

236
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,808
FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE LOOKED 

237
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:26,379
INTO HIS EYES AND SAW A MAN WHO 

238
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,880
WAS HONORABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY, 

239
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,483
AND THAT TURNED OUT TO BE A 

240
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,953
HUGE ERROR IN JUDGMENT, AND 

241
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:38,724
PRESIDENT PUTIN IS A FORMER 

242
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:38,957
K.G.B. 

243
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:39,725
OFFICER PROBABLY LOOKED INTO 

244
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:43,128
HIS EYES AND SAW A CASE NUMBER, 

245
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:44,397
AND GEORGIA HAD BEEN INVADED, 

246
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,934
AND 20% OF THE COUNTRY WAS 

247
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:54,040
OCCUPIED, AND THERE WERE 

248
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,374
ADVANCED CYBER ATTACKS. 

249
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,778
AND OBAMA, 7 OR 8 MONTHS AFTER 

250
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:02,682
THE INVASION OF GEORGIA, 

251
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,082
SECRETARY CLINTON PUSHING 

252
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:05,851
AWKWARDLY AND SYMBOLICALLY, THE 

253
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:07,687
RUSSIAN RESET BUTTON, AND THAT 

254
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,056
RESET HAS ESSENTIALLY TURNED 

255
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:19,865
INTO A REGRET BY THE NEXT TERM, 

256
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:22,401
RUSSIA INVADING CRIMEA AND 

257
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,737
STRIKING A WAR IN UKRAINE. 

258
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:28,074
PRESIDENT PUTIN HAS TAKEN 

259
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,308
MEASURES TO DESTABILIZE OR 

260
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,743
UNDERMINE AMERICA AND ITS 

261
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:30,976
ALLIES. 

262
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:32,278
I HOPE PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL 

263
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:41,754
LEARN FROM THE PREVIOUS 

264
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,190
ADMINISTRATIONS  ON THIS. 

265
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,426
>> DO YOU THINK HE WILL LOOK AT 

266
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:51,163
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND SEE A CASE 

267
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:51,396
NUMBER? 

268
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:53,532
AT TIMES HE DOES NOT EDIT 

269
00:08:53,532 --> 00:09:00,973
HIMSELF, IN TERMS OF  

270
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,040
EXPRESSING HIS EMOTIONS. 

271
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,809
DO YOU THINK HE'S AN EASY MARK 

272
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,244
FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN? 

273
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,879
>> THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN 

274
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,180
EXPERIENCE IN PRESIDENT TRUMP 

275
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,282
AND PRESIDENT PUTIN IN DEALING 

276
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:13,419
WITH THE MAJOR POLITICAL 

277
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:13,652
ISSUES. 

278
00:09:13,652 --> 00:09:15,287
PRESIDENT PUTIN HAS, AS I SAID 

279
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:18,524
EARLIER, HAS BEEN AROUND THE 

280
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:18,757
BLOCK. 

281
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:19,992
HE'S BEEN INVOLVED IN HIGH-

282
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,193
LEVEL, HIGH-STAKES NEGOTIATIONS 

283
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,695
FOR YEARS, FOR DECADES, AND 

284
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,331
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NEW ON THE 

285
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,866
SCENE, AND LIKE I SAID, HE 

286
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,701
SEEMS HIMSELF AS A GREAT DEAL 

287
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,970
MAKER,  BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT 

288
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,406
SORT OF DEAL HE WILL GET FROM 

289
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:33,939
PRESIDENT PUTIN BECAUSE 

290
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:36,942
PRESIDENT PUTIN IS NOT GOING TO 

291
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:38,377
GO INTO THE MEETING, WILLING TO 

292
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,679
GIVE EVERYTHING ANYTHING OR 

293
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:46,218
ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER, 

294
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,155
UNLESS -- GIVE EVERYTHING OR 

295
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,123
ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER AWAY, 

296
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,925
UNLESS IT BENEFITS RUSSIA. 

297
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,993
>> PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS 

298
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,828
HAVE MADE ERRORS AND MISTAKES 

299
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,496
WITH THE RUSSIANS, AND THIS IS 

300
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:58,798
THE THIRD PRESIDENT VLADIMIR 

301
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,032
PUTIN HAS SEEN, AND HE'S 

302
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:03,636
DEFINITELY BEEN AROUND THE 

303
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:03,869
BLOCK. 

304
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,705
A FORMER KBG SPY, AND HE'S WELL 

305
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,441
VERSED IN POLITICS, AND HERE'S 

306
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,809
ANOTHER QUESTION, THEN, THE 

307
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,977
FACT THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, 

308
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:13,312
PRESIDENT TRUMP GOES TO MEET 

309
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,282
WITH KIM JONG-UN, COMES OUT OF 

310
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,384
THAT MEETING, AND NOW SAYS, WE 

311
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,886
ARE GOING TO BE SUSPENDING 

312
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,955
MILITARY EXERCISES WITH SOUTH 

313
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,658
KOREA AND THE JAPANESE IN THE 

314
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,259
REGION, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT 

315
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,594
PYONGYANG HAS BEEN AFTER FOR 

316
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,363
MANY, MANY YEARS. 

317
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:32,498
AS YOU POINT OUT, VLADIMIR 

318
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,766
PUTIN IS NOT GIVING ANYTHING 

319
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,668
AWAY, AND THE FACT IT APPEARS 

320
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:38,904
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS REALLY, FOR 

321
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:39,839
WHATEVER REASON, REALLY WANTING 

322
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,841
VLADIMIR PUTIN TO LIKE HIM, YOU 

323
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,109
POINT OUT, HE'S BEEN TOUGH ON 

324
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,211
SANCTIONS AND TOUGH IN POINTING 

325
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,580
OUT THE ISSUES WITH REGARDS TO 

326
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,115
GERMANY AND THE PIPELINE AND 

327
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:55,721
THE OIL BEING SOLD, BUT HE DOES 

328
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,857
APPEAR TO WANT PUTIN TO LIKE 

329
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:58,057
HIM. 

330
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,024
IN JUST HAVING THE MEETING, 

331
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:00,693
DOES IT APPEAR ON THE FACE OF 

332
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,895
IT, IT'S A WIN? 

333
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,530
THE PRESIDENT HAS REFUSED TO 

334
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,065
PUBLICALLY, AT LEAST, CONDEMN 

335
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,666
ANYTHING THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN 

336
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,100
HAS DONE. 

337
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,668
ALL THE THINGS YOU MENTIONED, 

338
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:11,704
AND THEY ARE THINGS THAT PAST 

339
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:12,638
PRESIDENTS SHOULD HAVE, 

340
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,874
PERHAPS, NOT LET HAPPEN, THE 

341
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,509
PRESIDENT HAS NOT BEEN WILLING 

342
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:21,847
TO CRITICIZE VLADIMIR PUTIN. 

343
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,715
AGAIN, THERE'S A HUGE 

344
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,817
DIFFERENCE FROM THE RHETORIC OF 

345
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,085
THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TWITTER 

346
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,119
ACCOUNT AND WHAT THE POLICIES 

347
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,354
ARE ON THE GROUND. 

348
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:37,730
IF I WAS A UKRAINIAN SOLDIER, I 

349
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,231
WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE TANK 

350
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:42,268
MISSILE RATHER THAN A NICE 

351
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:42,501
TWEET. 

352
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,836
I TRY TO LOOK OBJECTIVELY AND 

353
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,203
SAY THERE'S A REASON HE'S 

354
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:47,506
TWEETING AND THE THINGS HE'S 

355
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,742
SAYING AND SAYING THE THINGS 

356
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,075
HE'S SAYING. 

357
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,611
IT'S UP TO DEBATE WHY HE'S 

358
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,780
DOING THIS, BUT WHEN THE RUBBER 

359
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,382
HITS THE ROAD, THE POLICIES 

360
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,983
COMING OUT OF THE 

361
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,351
ADMINISTRATION ON RUSSIA HAVE 

362
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,687
BEEN TOUGH, AND THEY ARE VERY 

363
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,289
MUCH WELCOMED, BUT YOUR POINT 

364
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,990
ABOUT, AGAIN, FOCUSING ON THE 

365
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,492
LACK OF EXPERIENCE BETWEEN THE 

366

TWO LEADERS ON THE BIGGER 

367
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,462
ISSUES IS VERY IMPORTANT, 

368
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,198
ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF 

369
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,333
THE ONE-ON-ONE MEETING THAT IS 

370
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,202
SCHEDULED, AT LEAST, TO LAST 

371
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:20,039
FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF. 

372
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,674
THIS IS THE ASPECT OF THE 

373
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,676
SUMMIT THAT CONCERNS ME THE 

374
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:23,909
MOST. 

375
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,811
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP COMES OUT, 

376
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:29,281
AFTER THE SUMMIT, AND REPEATS 

377
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,917
WHAT HE SAID IN SINGAPORE, 

378
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,053
ABOUT U.S. MILITARY EXERCISES 

379
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,120
BEING SUSPENDED, BECAUSE THEY 

380
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,894
ARE PROVOCATIVE, IT WOULD BE A 

381
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:42,161
DISASTER. 

382
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,230
NATO'S COLLECTIVE DEFENSE IS 

383
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,465
NECESSITATED BY THE LEVELS OF 

384
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:50,803
READINESS AND DEFENDING THE 

385
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,871
TERRITORY OF MILITARY STATES. 

386
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:54,206
THE EXERCISES ARE NOT 

387
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,941
PROVOCATIVE BECAUSE NATO IS A 

388
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:56,408
DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE. 

389
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,577
>> LUKE, BEFORE WE LET YOU GO, 

390
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,280

391
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,749
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE FACT 

392
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:07,386
THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS AN 

393
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,320
EXPERIENCED GEOPOLITICAL 

394
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,288
STRATEGIST, AND PREVIOUS 

395
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,856
PRESIDENTS WITHOUT EXPERIENCE 

396
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,659
HAVE COME ACROSS THE RUSSIAN 

397
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:14,727
LEADERS, MOST FAMOUSLY KENNEDY, 

398
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,897
COMING OUT OF THE FIRST MEETING 

399
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,900
SAYING HE WAS MAN HANDLED, BUT 

400
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,234
AT LEAST, WITH PRIOR PRESIDENTS 

401
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:26,872
F YOU LOOK AT  -- IF YOU LOOK 

402
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,841
AT THE CANVAS OF HISTORY, THEY 

403
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,743
WERE STRONG IN THEIR 

404
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:31,076
CONVICTIONS. 

405
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,478
PRESIDENT REAGAN WAS NOT AS 

406
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,480
WELL VERSED EITHER IN DEALING 

407
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,316
WITH THE RUSSIANS, BUT HE HAD 

408
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,484
THE STRENGTH OF HIS 

409
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,818
CONVICTIONS, AND I WONDER IF 

410
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,521
YOU, AND IT'S JUST A QUESTION 

411
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,624
BECAUSE OF THIS INTERESTING 

412
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,159
DISCUSSION, IF YOU OR ANYONE 

413
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,695
KNOWS HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP FEELS 

414
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,196
ABOUT RUSSIA, THE THREAT OF 

415
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:55,000
RUSSIA, SUCH AS IT EXITS, OR 

416
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,200
NOT. 

417
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,469
ARE WE ABLE TO DISCERN WHAT HIS 

418
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,071
CONVICTIONS ARE LIKE PRESIDENT 

419
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,006
REAGAN ABOUT THE SOVIET UNION 

420
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:08,914
OR PRESIDENT KENNEDY ABOUT THE  

421
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:09,882
SOVIET EXPANSION? 

422
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,484
>> THE WAY HE TWEETS, RUSSIA IS 

423
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:13,719
DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE 

424
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,252
INVESTIGATION FOR HIM. 

425
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:16,622
>> HE CALLS IT A WITCH HUNT, 

426
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,923
EVEN THOUGH ON FRIDAY 12 

427
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,092

428
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,894

429
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,562
INTERFERING WITH OUR ELECTIONS, 

430
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,665
AND HE SURPRISINGLY SAYS IT 

431
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:27,032
DIDN'T HAPPEN. 

432
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:27,165
. 

433
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:31,470
>> Reporter: WELL, I THINK,

UNTIL THEY ARE PUSHED BACK. 

440
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,147

442
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,249
ELECTIONS AS WELL, AND THIS 

443
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:50,422
SHOULD BE ONE OF THE TOP ISSUES 

444
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,957
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP RAISES IN 

445
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,158

446

THESE, AND HE IS TAKING TOUGHER 

453
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:06,672

THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN IN THE ONE-

1247
00:55:56,785 --> 00:55:58,221

ONE-ON-ONE MEETING. 

1256
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,404
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALREADY

THE WORLD. 

1279
00:57:13,729 --> 00:57:15,064
HE HOSTED IT, IT WAS FLAWLESS, 

1280
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:17,734

HE'S THE MAN TO BRING RUSSIA IN 

1285
00:57:24,173 --> 00:57:25,508
FROM THE COLD SO HE DOESN'T 

1286
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:29,078
HAVE TO WALK OUT OF THIS WITH 

1287
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:29,345
ANYTHING. 

1288
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:31,113
HE'S ALREADY GOT A GREAT  

1289
00:57:31,113 --> 00:57:31,380
VICTORY. 

1290
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:32,748
>> IT IS INCREDIBLE TO THINK IN 

1291
00:57:32,748 --> 00:57:35,384

U.S.-RUSSIAN PRESS CONFERENCE 

1297
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:47,297
WITH PUTIN IN MORE THAN A 

1298
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,031
DECADE BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA 

1299
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,432
REFUSED TO DO THAT. 

1300
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:50,533
DOES THAT GIVE PUTIN SOME SORT 

1301
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:51,601
OF STANDING THAT HE'S NOT HAD 

1302
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:54,603
IN THE PAST DECADE? 

1303
00:57:54,603 --> 00:57:55,003
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

1304
00:57:55,003 --> 00:57:58,241

00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,243
TROUBLING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

A REGIONAL POWER AND THAT 

1364
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:57,059
SEEMED TO IRK PRESIDENT PUTIN. 

1365
00:59:57,059 --> 01:00:01,197
HE WANTED TO BE SEEN AS A 

1366
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:01,797

1384
01:00:24,486 --> 01:00:27,056
NOT SO MUCH ABOUT PROSECUTION 

1385
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:28,491
BUT IT'S ABOUT DETERRENCE. 

1386
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:30,093

AND THIS PRESS CONFERENCE OF 

1452
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:06,355
THEM STANDING SIDE BY SIDE, 

1453
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,391
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE, I 

1454
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:14,030
THINK, 2005 WHEN BUSH 43 HAD A 

1455
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,231
-- WE LEARNED BETTER, WE 

1456
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,866
LEARNED NOT TO DO THAT AGAIN 

1457
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:17,934
BECAUSE WHAT IS VLADIMIR PUTIN 

1458
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:19,001
GOING TO SAY STANDINGNEXT TO 

1459
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:20,436

STATES IN TERMS  OF, NO, WE 

1461
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:25,374
DIDN'T DO IT, IS DUMP GOING TO 

1462
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:26,909
-- DONALD TRUMP GOING TO SAY 

1463
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,245
YES YOU DID, IT MATTERS IF YOU 

1464
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:33,115
ATTACK AMERICA EVEN IF I WASN'T 

1465
01:02:33,115 --> 01:02:35,952
IN THE OVAL OFFICE AT THE TIME 

1466
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:36,118
-- 

1467
01:02:36,118 --> 01:02:36,953
>> I'M DOWNPLAYING THIS 

1468
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:38,320
QUESTION OF INTERFERENCE 

1469
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,388
BECAUSE THERE'S THINGS WE NEED 

1470
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:41,757
TO WORK WITH RUSSIA ON? 

1471
01:02:41,757 --> 01:02:42,191
>> RIGHT. 

1472
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:43,292
>> SO THAT SETS THE 

1473
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:44,994
EXPECTATIONS HIGH FOR THIS 

1474
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:48,698
WHICH IS TO SAY THIS 

1475
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:49,632
INTERFERENCE PEOPLE ARE WORRIED 

1476
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:52,101
ABOUT, LET'S NOT FOCUS ON THAT, 

1477
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,070
LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT WE CAN DO 

1478
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:54,337
TOGETHER. 

1479
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:55,871
WHAT CAN RUSSIA AND U.S. DO 

1480
01:02:55,871 --> 01:02:56,906
TOGETHER, WHAT WOULD BIG 

1481
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:57,974
ACHIEVEMENTS BE FROM THIS 

1482
01:02:57,974 --> 01:02:58,241
MEETING? 

1483
01:02:58,241 --> 01:02:59,141
>> VLADIMIR PUTIN'S STRATEGY 

1484
01:02:59,141 --> 01:03:00,509
HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE HE 

1485
01:03:00,509 --> 01:03:03,079
SAID YOU NEED ME, EVEN IF I 

1486
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:04,080
MISBEHAVE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU 

1487
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,850
HOW MUCH YOU NEED ON SOME OF 

1488
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:08,618
THESE INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS. 

1489
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:09,619
IN TERMS OF DELIVERABLE -- WE 

1490
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,387
ARE HOPING FOR THE MOST LOW  

1491
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:13,322
HANGING FRUIT IS TRYING TO 

1492
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:15,291
EXTEND THE EXISTING SO-CALLED 

1493
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,093
NEW START TREATY, WHICH, YOU 

1494
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:19,829
KNOW, PUTS SOME CAPS ON 

1495
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:22,164
BALLISTIC MISSILES AND THE 

1496
01:03:22,164 --> 01:03:22,364
LIKE. 

1497
01:03:22,364 --> 01:03:23,198
HOWEVER, RUSSIA IS ALREADY 

1498
01:03:23,198 --> 01:03:25,701
ACHIEVING ON THE INF TREATY 

1499
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:27,603
WHICH IS ANOTHER NUCLEAR ARMS 

1500
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:28,537
CONTROL AGREEMENT. 

1501
01:03:28,537 --> 01:03:30,139
PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD EXTEND 

1502
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,541
THAT, THERE'S ALREADY A 

1503
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:34,176
PROVISION IN NEW START THAT 

1504
01:03:34,176 --> 01:03:36,545
WOULD ALLOW HIM TO DO IT AND 

1505
01:03:36,545 --> 01:03:37,746
PUT THE TRUMP BRAND ON IT. 

1506
01:03:37,746 --> 01:03:38,848
WILL HE ACCEPT IT? 

1507
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,683
I DON'T KNOW. 

1508
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:42,852
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT WITH THE 

1509
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:44,320
NUCLEAR -- WILL HE DO THAT 

1510
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:44,887
HERE? 

1511
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:45,287
THAT'S THE HOPE. 

1512
01:03:45,287 --> 01:03:48,925
THE OTHER THINGS ARE SOME SORT 

1513
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:51,127
OF WINDOW DRESSING, SOME 

1514
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:52,194
HUMANITARIAN ACCESS THEY ARE 

1515
01:03:52,194 --> 01:03:54,597
ASKING FOR, NFC OFFICIALS SAID 

1516
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:55,631
YESTERDAY TO ME THEY WERE 

1517
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,600
ASKING TO BE ABLE TO BRING AID 

1518
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,867
CONVOYS INTO SYRIA, TO THE 

1519
01:03:58,867 --> 01:03:59,902
SOUTHERN PART OF THAT COUNTRY 

1520
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:01,837
WHICH IS UNDER ASSAULT RIGHT 

1521
01:04:01,837 --> 01:04:03,172
NOW IN VIOLATION OF AN 

1522
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,373
AGREEMENT THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN 

1523
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:06,943
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE TWICE 

1524
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:11,647
IN VIETNAM AND IN GERMANY IN 

1525
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:11,847
2017. 

1526
01:04:11,847 --> 01:04:14,016
SO THAT'S WHAT'S INTERESTING, 

1527
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,117
THIS IDEA APPROACHING, WE CAN 

1528
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:16,419
HAVE ANOTHER AGREEMENT WITH 

1529
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:17,720
RUSSIA IN SYRIA AT THE TIME 

1530
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,488
WHEN THEY ARE ACTIVELY 

1531
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:20,923
VIOLATING THE ONE THAT WE 

1532
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:21,290
ALREADY HAVE. 

1533
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,660
THEY ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT 

1534
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:25,394
POSSIBLY WHETHER OR NOT TO 

1535
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:26,529
BRING UP WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN 

1536
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:30,032
THE IDEA OF ASKING FOR HELP, 

1537
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,434
EVACUATING SOME OF THOSE THE 

1538
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:32,735
U.S. PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED LIKE 

1539
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:34,804
THE WHITE HELMETS, THE RESCUE 

1540
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,706
WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN HELPING 

1541
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,173
OUT SYRIANS IN DISTRESS. 

1542
01:04:38,173 --> 01:04:40,943
>> THE CONCERN IS THAT VAD 

1543
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:42,278
PUTIN WILL -- VLADIMIR PUTIN 

1544
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:44,146
WILL RUN CIRCLES AROUND 

1545
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:45,547
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

1546
01:04:45,547 --> 01:04:46,983
HE'S HAD 20 YEARS EXPERIENCE AS 

1547
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:47,983
PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA. 

1548
01:04:47,983 --> 01:04:49,452
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE'S GOING 

1549
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:51,654
TO APPROACH THIS BY WINGING IT, 

1550
01:04:51,654 --> 01:05:01,297
THE SORT OF WE WILL  SEE 

1551
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:01,597
MENTALITY. 

1552
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:03,065
LET'S BRINGIAN BREMER IN. 

1553
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:03,966
HOW CONCERNING IS THAT? 

1554
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:07,203
>> I THINK IT'S CONCERNING TO 

1555
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:08,671
TRUMP'S OWN ADMINISTRATION, TO 

1556
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:10,940
HIS ADVISORS, WE CERTAINLY SAW 

1557
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,275
IN THE NATO MEETINGS THAT TRUMP 

1558
01:05:13,275 --> 01:05:16,879
WAS RUNNING ALL OF THESE 

1559
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:17,346
BILATERALS HIMSELF. 

1560
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:19,748
HE WASN'T GOING TO HIS ADVISORS 

1561
01:05:19,748 --> 01:05:23,853
EVEN AS HE DID AT THE G7 WITH 

1562
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:30,525
LARRY  LADLO. 

1563
01:05:30,525 --> 01:05:31,827
IT'S THE TWO OF THEM. 

1564
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,729
HE'S GOING TO BRING UP RUSSIAN 

1565
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:35,297
INTERFERENCE IN U.S. ELECTIONS. 

1566
01:05:35,297 --> 01:05:37,032
WHAT'S HE GOING TO SAY? 

1567
01:05:37,032 --> 01:05:38,734
HOW IS TRUMP GOING TO RESPOND 

1568
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:39,034
TO THAT. 

1569
01:05:39,034 --> 01:05:40,136
TRUMP IS THINKING, TO THE 

1570
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:42,004
EXTEND THIS GUY WAS -- EXTENT 

1571
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:43,572
THIS GUY WAS INVOLVED, HE WAS 

1572
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:45,341
SUPPORTING ME, HE WAS GOING 

1573
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:47,376
AFTER THE DNC, HE WAS GOING 

1574
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:48,243
AFTER HILLARY. 

1575
01:05:48,243 --> 01:05:49,278
THAT'S CLEARLY ONE OF THE 

1576
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:52,515
MEETINGS HE HAS TO HAVE THE 

1577
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:54,483

01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:27,603
TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT  

1629
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:31,907
CHINA, OUR MUTUAL FRIEND, 

1630
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:32,308
PRESIDENT XI. 

1631
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:33,075
CHINA.

1632
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:49,692
OUR MUTUAL FRIEND, PRESIDENT XI.

1633
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:51,527
>> I THINK WE HAVE GREAT 

1634
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:53,328
OPPORTUNITIES TOGETHER AS TWO 

1635
01:08:53,328 --> 01:08:55,064
COUNTRIES THAT, FRANKLY, WE 

1636
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:56,098
HAVE NOT BEEN GETTING ALONG 

1637
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:57,600
VERY WELL FOR THE LAST NUMBER 

1638
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,066
OF YEARS. 

1639
01:08:58,066 --> 01:09:00,368
I'VE BEEN HERE NOT TOO LONG BUT 

1640
01:09:00,368 --> 01:09:01,537
IT'S GETTING CLOSE TO TWO 

1641
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:03,404
YEARS, BUT I THINK WE WILL END 

1642
01:09:03,404 --> 01:09:06,107
UP HAVING AN EXTRAORDINARY 

1643
01:09:06,107 --> 01:09:06,441
RELATIONSHIP. 

1644
01:09:06,441 --> 01:09:06,741
I HOPE SO. 

1645
01:09:06,741 --> 01:09:08,477
I'VE BEEN SAYING AND I'M SURE 

1646
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:09,411
YOU'VE HEARD OVER THE YEARS AND 

1647
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:11,247
AS YOU CAMPAIGN, THAT GETTING 

1648
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:12,615
ALONG WITH RUSSIA IS A GOOD 

1649
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:13,782
THING, NOT A BAD THING. 

1650
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:15,517
 HEARD  

1651
01:09:15,517 --> 01:09:17,152
TWO YEARS THAT GETTING ALONG 

1652
01:09:17,152 --> 01:09:17,953
WITH RUSSIA IS A GOOD THING, NOT

1653
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:33,536
A BAD THING.

1654
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,174
>> AND I REALLY THINK THE WORLD 

1655
01:09:39,174 --> 01:09:41,176
WANTS TO SEE US GET ALONG. 

1656
01:09:41,176 --> 01:09:43,578
WE ARE THE TWO GREAT NUCLEAR 

1657
01:09:43,578 --> 01:09:43,812
POWERS. 

1658
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:46,749
WE HAVE 90% OF THE NUCLEAR AND 

1659
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:48,082
THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING. 

1660
01:09:48,082 --> 01:09:50,886
IT'S A BAD THING, AND I THINK 

1661
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:52,321
WE HOPEFULLY CAN DO SOMETHING 

1662
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:54,757
ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT A 

1663
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:56,158
POSITIVE FORCE, IT'S A NEGATIVE 

1664
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:57,926
FORCE SO WE WILL BE TALKING 

1665
01:09:57,926 --> 01:09:59,195
ABOUT THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS. 

1666
01:09:59,395 --> 01:09:59,561
 

1667
01:09:59,561 --> 01:10:00,295
BE TALKING ABOUT THAT AMONG 

1668
01:10:00,295 --> 01:10:15,844
OTHER THINGS.

1669
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:23,852
>> AND WITH THAT THE WORLD 

1670
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:25,788
AWAITS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO 

1671
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:27,256
OUR PERSONAL DISCUSSION, WHICH 

1672
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:28,190
I THINK BEGINS NOW AND THEN WE 

1673
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:29,692
ARE GOING TO MEET OUR WHOLE 

1674
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:29,892
TEAM. 

1675
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:32,728
YOU HAVE QUITE A FEW 

1676
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:33,328
REPRESENTATIVES, AND WE ALL 

1677
01:10:33,328 --> 01:10:34,429
HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND 

1678
01:10:34,429 --> 01:10:36,365
HOPEFULLY WE WILL COME UP WITH 

1679
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:37,465
ANSWERS, MOST IMPORTANTLY. 

1680
01:10:37,465 --> 01:10:38,500
IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. 

1681
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:38,900
 

1682
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,469
HOPEFULLY WE'LL COME UP

1683
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:41,203
>> THANK YOU. 

1684
01:10:41,336 --> 01:10:41,770

1685
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,605
ANSWERS HOPEFULLY.

1686
01:10:43,605 --> 01:10:54,817
IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

1696
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:10,165
K YOU VERY.

1697
01:11:10,298 --> 01:11:12,801
>> AND THERE YOU SEE THAT 

1698
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,769
HANDSHAKE AND WARM WORDS 

1699
01:11:14,769 --> 01:11:16,305
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

1700
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:18,307
PRESIDENT PUTIN AS PRESIDENT 

1701
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:20,509
TRUMP CONGRATULATING PUTIN ON A 

1702
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:21,910
VERY SUCCESSFUL WORLD CUP, THAT 

1703
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:25,047
HE SAYS EVERYBODY WATCHED AND 

1704
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:25,947
WAS SPECTACULAR. 

1705
01:11:25,947 --> 01:11:26,949
ELIZABETH PALMER IS HERE WITH 

1706
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,684
ME AND HAS COVERED PRESIDENT 

1707
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:30,119
PUTIN FOR DECADES SINCE HE HAS 

1708
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:30,952
BEEN IN POWER. 

1709
01:11:30,952 --> 01:11:33,088
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF HIS 

1710
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:33,355
COMMENTS? 

1711
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:35,958
WHAT DID HE MAKE OF HIS BODY 

1712
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:36,225
LANGUAGE? 

1713
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:38,761
>> HE WAS LOOKING RELAXED BUT 

1714
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:39,061
NOT EAGER. 

1715
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:40,396
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS LEANING 

1716
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:42,831
FORWARD WITH IN INTENSITY. 

1717
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:44,032
PUTIN ALMOST LOOKED BORED, WAY 

1718
01:11:44,032 --> 01:11:45,333
TOO STRONG BUT SLIGHTLY  

1719
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:45,600
DETACHED. 

1720
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,670
>> IS THAT INTENTIONAL? 

1721
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:48,003
>> PROBABLY. 

1722
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:50,939
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER HE'S AN EX-

1723
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:52,374
SPY, HE'S BEEN TRAINED IN MIND 

1724
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:54,810
GAMES AND HE WAS ALSO VERY 

1725
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,578
NONCOMMITTAL ABOUT WHAT THEY 

1726
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:57,880
WOULD TALK ABOUT WHEREAS 

1727
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,081
PRESIDENT TRUMP ACTUALLY PUT 

1728
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:00,182
SOME SUGGESTIONS ON THE TABLE. 

1729
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:01,950
SO PUTIN IS PLAYING HIS CARDS 

1730
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:03,652
VERY CLOSE TO HIS CHEST. 

1731
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:04,553
>> WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS 

1732
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:08,190
THE WORLD WANTS TO SEE US GET 

1733
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,224
ALONG, GETTING ALONG WITH 

1734
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:11,827
RUSSIA IS A GOOD THING, HOW 

1735
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:13,428
DOES THAT SQUARE WITH WHAT THE 

1736
01:12:13,428 --> 01:12:17,166
REST OF THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION 

1737
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,435
IS SAYING IN RUSSIA'S CURRENT 

1738
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:20,936
EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE AMERICAN 

1739
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:21,769
DEMOCRACY THROUGH CYBER ATTACKS 

1740
01:12:21,769 --> 01:12:22,637
AND OTHER MEANS? 

1741
01:12:22,637 --> 01:12:23,805
>> GETTING ALONG WITH RUSSIA 

1742
01:12:23,805 --> 01:12:25,240
CLEARLY IS A GOOD THING. 

1743
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,475
THE QUESTION IS, AT WHAT COST, 

1744
01:12:27,475 --> 01:12:30,112
YOU KNOW AND IF IT MEANS 

1745
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:31,914
PUTTING UP WITH RUSSIA'S 

1746
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:34,383
CONTINUING ATTACKS ON AMERICAN 

1747
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:37,986
INSTITUTIONS AND TRYING TO 

1748
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:39,922
ENLARGE ITS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE 

1749
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:42,057
IN EUROPE AND  UNDERCUTTING 

1750
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:44,092
NATO, THEN PROBABLY MOST OF THE 

1751
01:12:44,092 --> 01:12:44,793
AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS WOULD 

1752
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:46,728
SAY, NO, THE COST IS TOO HIGH 

1753
01:12:46,728 --> 01:12:48,430
AND IT'S  UNLIKELY THAT PUTIN 

1754
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,899
IS GOING TO LEAVE THIS 

1755
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:52,034
CONFERENCE HAVING GIVING 

1756
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,502
ANYTHING UP, LET'S JUST SAY 

1757
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:53,869
RIGHT NOW. 

1758
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,003
>> NOW THIS HISTORIC SUMMIT 

1759
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:56,738
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM THAT 

1760
01:12:56,738 --> 01:12:57,806
SOME IN THE ADMINISTRATION ARE 

1761
01:12:57,806 --> 01:13:00,642
TRYING TO DOWNPLAY AS JUST A 

1762
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:03,344
MEETING, BUT AN EXTRAORDINARY 

1763
01:13:03,344 --> 01:13:04,780
HOUR AND A HALF SCHEDULED, HOUR 

1764
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,849
AND A HALF PRIVATE MEETING THAT 

1765
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:09,084
UMP CALLED A PERSONAL MEETING 

1766
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,053
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM AND 

1767
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,655
THEN A PRESS CONFERENCE, MAJOR 

1768
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:14,757
GARRETT HAS BEEN COVERING 

1769
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:17,359
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS HE TRAVELS 

1770
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:17,959
THROUGH EUROPE. 

1771
01:13:17,959 --> 01:13:19,428
WHAT ELSE STRIKES YOU ABOUT 

1772
01:13:19,428 --> 01:13:20,495
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP MENTIONED 

1773
01:13:20,495 --> 01:13:22,830
JUST THIS MORNING? 

1774
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:24,800
>> WELL, TALKING ABOUT THE HOPE 

1775
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,734
FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY 

1776
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:27,202
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA SETS A 

1777
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:28,103
PRETTY HIGH BAR. 

1778
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:30,205
ONE THING I THINK IT'S WORTH 

1779
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:31,039
REMEMBERING AS PRESIDENT TRUMP 

1780
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,107
GOES INTO THIS SUMMIT, HE'S GOT 

1781
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:34,142
A COUPLE OF THINGS ON HIS MIND 

1782
01:13:34,142 --> 01:13:35,344
IN RELATIONSHIP TO VLADIMIR 

1783
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:35,577
PUTIN. 

1784
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:37,513
HE WILL COME IN AND SAY OUR 

1785
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:39,381
ECONOMY IS VERY STRONG. 

1786
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:40,282
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

1787
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:41,617
ADMINISTRATION HAS AUTHORIZED 

1788
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:43,384
THE EXPORT OF LIQUEFIED NATURAL 

1789
01:13:43,384 --> 01:13:44,419
GAS TO EUROPE. 

1790
01:13:44,419 --> 01:13:47,089
IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET BUT IT'S 

1791
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:47,389
IN PROCESS. 

1792
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:48,657
THAT'S A COUNTER WEIGHT TO 

1793
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:50,259
RUSSIAN INFLUENCE OVER ENERGY 

1794
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,292
SUPPLIES THROUGHOUT EUROPE. 

1795
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:52,661
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ALSO 

1796
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:54,363
APPROVED THE MOVEMENT OF LETHAL 

1797
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:55,563
WEAPONS TO UKRAINE. 

1798
01:13:55,563 --> 01:13:57,299
THAT HASN'T CHANGED THE 

1799
01:13:57,299 --> 01:13:58,800
MILITARY DYNAMIC THERE IN ANY 

1800
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,235
WAY BUT IT'S A STEP THAT THE 

1801
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:01,203
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T 

1802
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:02,838
TAKE SO THE PRESIDENT WOULD 

1803
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:06,475
ARGUE HERE IN HELSINKI HE DOES 

1804
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:09,545
DONE THINGS TO SEND A SIGNAL TO 

1805
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:10,979
PUTIN THAT HE IS GOING TO BE 

1806
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:14,316
TOUGHER ECONOMY CLEE IN TERMS 

1807
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:16,218
OF -- ECONOMY IN TERMS OF 

1808
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:17,185

COVERED RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 

1848

VLADIMIR PUTIN FOR YEARS IS 

1849
01:15:34,128 --> 01:15:37,599
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE BODY 

1850
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:37,866
LANGUAGE? 

1851
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:39,234
WHEN YOU SEE VLADIMIR PUTIN 

1852
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:40,535
RELAXED AS HE IS IN THAT CHAIR, 

1853
01:15:40,535 --> 01:15:42,104
WHEN HE SAW HIM GET OFF THE 

1854
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:43,004
PLANE, WHAT DO YOU THINK? 

1855
01:15:43,004 --> 01:15:44,172
>> YEAH, HE CAME OUT OF THE

01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:45,407
PLANE RIGHT AWAY VERY 

1857
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:46,541
CONFIDENT, SORT OF SWAGGERING,

01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:54,182

01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:56,985
SOLDIERS THAT WERE THERE TO

01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:57,452
MEET THEM. 

1862
01:15:57,452 --> 01:15:59,387
HE SEEMS READY TO GO. 

1863
01:15:59,387 --> 01:16:01,390
THERE IS -- SUSAN GLASSER OVER 

1864
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:05,160
THE WEEKEND, THIS IS LIKE  

1865
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,496
MUHAMMAD ALI FIGHTING SORT OF A 

1866
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:07,863
FEATHER WEIGHT. 

1867
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:09,163
PUTIN IS PREPARED. 

1868
01:16:09,163 --> 01:16:14,769
HE IS A TRAINED OFFICER. 

1869
01:16:14,769 --> 01:16:16,438
ONE TRUMP HASN'T DONE MUCH 

1870
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:18,240
PREPARATION FOR. úTHE BODY LANG 

1871
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,507
OF THIS MEETING ARE ALL VERY 

1872
01:16:19,507 --> 01:16:20,575
IMPORTANT FOR SORT OF 

1873
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:21,476
DETERMINING HOW OVER THE NEXT 

1874
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:22,144
FEW HOURS THIS GOES. 

1875
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:24,479
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS CERTAINLY 

1876
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:25,380
BEEN EXPRESSING THE GENERAL 

1877
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,415
TOPICS THAT HE'S INTERESTED IN. 

1878
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,617
HE DID SO RIGHT HERE, HE TALKED 

1879
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:29,952
ABOUT NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION, 

1880
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:32,054
TALKED ABOUT TRADE, TALKED 

1881
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:32,654
ABOUT CHINA BUT AT THE SAME 

1882
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:34,256
TIME AS HE'S BEEN ASKED ABOUT 

1883
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:35,323
THIS MEETING, HE'S INSISTED 

1884
01:16:35,323 --> 01:16:37,459
THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A REAL 

1885
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:39,161
AGENDA, THAT IT'S -- AND HE HAS 

1886
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:40,228
SORT OF GONE BACK AND FORTH 

1887
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:42,064
BETWEEN CALLING IT A SUMMIT AND 

1888
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:43,999
A MEETING AND IS IT CASUAL, NOT 

1889
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:45,534
CASUAL, THAT SORT OF THING. 

1890
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:47,135
IS THERE A BENEFIT TO NOT 

1891
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:49,504
HAVING A SET AGENDA WHEN YOU'RE 

1892
01:16:49,504 --> 01:16:50,939
MEETING PRESIDENT PUTIN FOR THE 

1893
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:51,406
FIRST TIME? 

1894
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:51,873
>> I DON'T THINK SO. 

1895
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:53,075
I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING 

1896
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:54,309
TO LOWER EXPECTATIONS, 

1897
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:55,409
ESPECIALLY OVER THE WEEKEND. 

1898
01:16:55,409 --> 01:16:56,611
WE SAW AMBASSADOR HUNTSMAN SAY, 

1899
01:16:56,611 --> 01:16:57,813
LIKE YOU MENTIONED, THIS ISN'T 

1900
01:16:57,813 --> 01:17:00,248
A SUMMIT, THIS IS JUST A 

1901
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:00,515
MEETING. 

1902
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:01,883
THIS IS THE SEVENTH -- I WOULD 

1903
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:03,952
CALL IT A SUMMIT, SUMMIT 

1904
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,588
BETWEEN U.S. AND RUSSIAN 

1905
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:08,623
LEADERS, THE FIRST SINCE THE 

1906
01:17:08,623 --> 01:17:11,025
RUSSIAN INVASION OF CRIMEA. 

1907
01:17:11,025 --> 01:17:13,128
IT IS A BIG DEAL THIS IS 

1908
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:14,062
HAPPENING AT ALL. 

1909
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:16,198
I THINK TO GO INTO THIS WITHOUT 

1910
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:17,065
ANY OBJECTIVES, WITHOUT A CLEAR 

1911
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:20,502
SENSE OF WHAT A VICTORY IS OR 

1912
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:22,237
WHAT'S DEALING OVER THIS  

1913
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:22,737
MEETING, THE MUELLER 

1914
01:17:22,737 --> 01:17:24,172
INVESTIGATION AND OTHER ACTIONS 

1915
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:26,508
IN UKRAINE TO ME IS VERY RISKY, 

1916
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:27,409
VERY RISKY THING TO DO. 

1917
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:28,777
>> IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE 

1918
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:30,979
PRESIDENT DID LAY OUT AN AGENDA 

1919
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:33,248
OF SORTS WHERE VLADIMIR PUTIN 

1920
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:34,983
DIDN'T LAY OUT ANYTHING. 

1921
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:38,153
HE WAS POKER FACED THE ENTIRE 

1922
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:39,154
TIME THROUGHOUT THIS LITTLE 

1923
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:41,089
INTRODUCTION THAT THEY JUST HAD 

1924
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:42,290
HERE AND YET AS THE PRESIDENT 

1925
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:43,158
LAID OUT SOME OF THE THINGS 

1926
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,326
THAT HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT, 

1927
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,094
HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE 

1928
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:46,728
ELECTION MEDDLING AND I DON'T 

1929
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:48,130
KNOW IF THAT WAS PERHAPS THE 

1930
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:48,897
RIGHT AND APPROPRIATE TIME TO 

1931
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:50,132
DO SO BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO 

1932
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,333
LAY OUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS 

1933
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,034
THAT YOU EXPECT TO TALK TO 

1934
01:17:53,034 --> 01:17:54,136
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR 

1935
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:55,170
PUTIN ABOUT, WHY NOT SAY, ALSO 

1936
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,439
WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT 

1937
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:00,642
CYBER SECURITY AND CYBER 

1938
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:02,077
THREATS AND, YOU KNOW -- WHAT'S 

1939
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:03,712
YOUR TAKE ON WHY YOU DON'T 

1940
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:06,715
BRING THAT PART OF THE 

1941
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:07,082
DISCUSSION UP? 

1942
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:08,216
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT 

1943
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:10,786
TO GET OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT 

1944
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:12,053
FROM THE GET GO? 

1945
01:18:12,053 --> 01:18:13,021
>> LINGERING OVER THIS WHOLE 

1946
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,656
THING IS THE RUSSIAN MEDDLING 

1947
01:18:14,656 --> 01:18:15,791
IN THE U.S. ELECTION AND A LOT 

1948
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:16,958
OF PEOPLE SAYING THIS SUMMIT 

1949
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,493
SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING AT ALL. 

1950
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:21,697
WE SAW THE INDICTMENT OF 12 

1951
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,365
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS ON FRIDAY AND 

1952
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,066
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION KNEW 

1953
01:18:25,066 --> 01:18:25,967
ABOUT THAT AND DESPITE THAT 

1954
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:27,235
FACT DECIDED TO GO AHEAD WITH 

1955
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:28,069
IT  ANYWAY. 

1956
01:18:28,069 --> 01:18:29,704
SO THE FACT THAT TRUMP DIDN'T 

1957
01:18:29,704 --> 01:18:32,741
COME OUT FORCEFULLY AND SAY 

1958
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:33,809
RIGHT AWAY, YOU KNOW, AND TALK 

1959
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:35,310
ABOUT THIS ISSUE IS VERY 

1960
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:36,678
TELLING AND I THINK HE GOES 

1961
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:38,480
INTO THIS MEETING SORT OF IN A 

1962
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,681
SIMILAR POSITION AS VLADIMIR 

1963
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:41,550
PUTIN TRYING TO TAMP DOWN THE 

1964
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:42,850
IDEA THAT RUSSIAN HAD ANY 

1965
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:44,186
IMPACT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE 

1966
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:45,387
ELECTION AND I THINK AS 

1967
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:46,855
AMERICANS THAT'S SOMETHING WE 

1968
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:47,922
SHOULD SEE AS PROBLEMATIC. 

1969
01:18:47,922 --> 01:18:51,359
>> WE WERE TALKING TO LUKE 

1970
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:53,094
COFFEY FROM THE HERITAGE 

1971
01:18:53,094 --> 01:18:53,694
FOUNDATION, A CONSERVATIVE 

1972
01:18:53,694 --> 01:18:54,529
LEANING FOUNDATION AND HIS 

1973
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:56,798
POINT WAS, SURE, YOU CAN LISTEN 

1974
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:57,632
TO THE RHETORIC, LISTEN TO WHAT 

1975
01:18:57,632 --> 01:18:58,500
THE PRESIDENT SAYS BUT IF YOU 

1976
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,668
LOOK AT WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION 

1977
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:01,369
HAS DONE, THE ADMINISTRATION 

1978
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:03,371
HAS MAINTAINED A HARD LINE WITH 

1979
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:03,604
RUSSIA. 

1980
01:19:03,604 --> 01:19:05,239
THE SANCTIONS ARE IN PLACE. 

1981
01:19:05,239 --> 01:19:06,908
THEY EXPELLED A BUNCH OF 

1982
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:08,210
DIPLOMATS IN LINE WITH A NUMBER 

1983
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:12,214
OF OTHER ALLIES AFTER THE 

1984
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:13,315
POISONING IN BRITAIN AND TO 

1985
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:14,416
YOUR POINT, THE JUSTICE 

1986
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,784
DEPARTMENT HAS JUST INDICTED A 

1987
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:18,620
BUNCH OF RUSSIANS, MILITARY 

1988
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:18,820
GUYS. 

1989
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:19,855
SO MAYBE WE ARE HEARING ALL 

1990
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:22,023
THIS TALK BUT REALLY IT DOESN'T 

1991
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:24,793
ACCOUNT FOR ANYTHING -- DOESN'T 

1992
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:27,829
COUNT FOR ANYTHING, ALL IT IS 

1993
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:28,129
IS ACTION. 

1994
01:19:28,129 --> 01:19:30,332
>> THE REST OF CONGRESS AND THE 

1995
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:32,067
ADMINISTRATION HAS A HARD LINE 

1996
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:33,335
AGAINST RUSSIA MATTER ON 

1997
01:19:33,335 --> 01:19:34,369
SANCTIONS, CONGRESS CAN STOP 

1998
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:38,173
THE U.S. FROM UNDOING THIS. 

1999
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:38,940
ON SYRIA, THERE ARE PLENTY OF 

2000
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,041
THINGS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION 

2001
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,476
CAN DO AND CONGRESS CAN DO THAT 

2002
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:43,144
HE DOESN'T HAVE AN IMPACT ON. 

2003
01:19:43,144 --> 01:19:44,446
BUT THE VERY FACT OF THE 

2004
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:45,647
PRESIDENT GOING TO MEET WITH 

2005
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:46,381
THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT IN THE 

2006
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:47,948
FIRST PLACE IS AMAZING. 

2007
01:19:47,948 --> 01:19:49,283
THE VERY FACT THAT HE DOES SO 

2008
01:19:49,283 --> 01:19:56,524
IN A WEEK WHERE HE ALSO BEMOANS 

2009
01:19:56,524 --> 01:19:57,525
NATO IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT 

2010
01:19:57,525 --> 01:20:02,164
SHIFTS THE BROADER LANDSCAPE, 

2011
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:03,565
GEO POLITICAL LANDSCAPE  BECAUSE

2012
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:05,433
-- AND BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER 

2013
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:07,535
THINGS THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN CAN 

2014
01:20:07,535 --> 01:20:08,370
SEE AS SYMBOLS OF THE U.S. 

2015
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:10,372
ISN'T GOING TO HIT BACK IN A 

2016
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:11,706
WAY THAT PREVIOUS 

2017
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:12,173
ADMINISTRATIONS HAD. 

2018
01:20:12,173 --> 01:20:13,074
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. 

2019
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:14,676
THERE ARE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES 

2020
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:16,378
WHERE IT MATTERS MORE THAN 

2021
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:17,512
OTHERS BUT I THINK THE IDEA 

2022
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:19,280
THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT HE 

2023
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,082
-- YOU KNOW, WATCH WHAT THE 

2024
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:23,552
ADMINISTRATION DOES, NOT WHAT 

2025
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,552
TRUMP SAYS IS UNFAIR. 

2026
01:20:24,552 --> 01:20:26,554
>> YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT, 

2027
01:20:26,554 --> 01:20:29,391
WHICH IS THAT THE CONGRESS IS 

2028
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:30,858
THERE TO CHECK THE PRESIDENT OF 

2029
01:20:30,858 --> 01:20:32,427
THE UNITED STATES AND IF YOU 

2030
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:33,562
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER 

2031
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:34,896
THE LAST WEEK OR SO SINCE 

2032
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:39,401
PRESIDENT TRUMP ARRIVED IN 

2033
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:42,070
EUROPE, THE PRESIDENT -- IN A 

2034
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:43,571
WEEKEND INTERVIEW WITH JEFF 

2035
01:20:43,571 --> 01:20:46,174
GLOR SUGGESTED THAT THE EU WAS 

2036
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:47,709
A BIGGER FOE THAN RUSSIA WAS 

2037
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:48,843
AND YET WHAT WE SAW FROM 

2038
01:20:48,843 --> 01:20:50,345
CONGRESS WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS 

2039
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:53,048
GOING AFTER NATO IS PAUL RYAN 

2040
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:54,749
SAYING THAT NATO IS 

2041
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:55,483
INDISPENSABLE, NOT TALKING 

2042
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:56,351
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE 

2043
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:57,451
STEPPED UP THEIR COMMITMENTS. 

2044
01:20:57,451 --> 01:20:59,187
THEY HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO DO 

2045
01:20:59,187 --> 01:20:59,620
THAT BY 2024. 

2046
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:01,489
THAT WAS AGREED IN 2014. 

2047
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:05,426
IT SEEMS AS IF PRESIDENT TRUMP 

2048
01:21:05,426 --> 01:21:07,629
WAS DRAGGED KICKING AND 

2049
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:09,030
SCREAMING TO IMPOSE THOSE 

2050
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:09,330
SANCTIONS. 

2051
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:10,699
HE SAYS NO ONE HAS BEEN TOUGHER 

2052
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:11,900
ON RUSSIA THAN HIM. 

2053
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:12,534
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED 

2054
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:15,904
STATES HAS BEEN TOUGH ON 

2055
01:21:15,904 --> 01:21:16,137
RUSSIA. 

2056
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:17,038
IT TOOK CONGRESS TO GET THOSE 

2057
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:17,471
SANCTIONS IN PLACE. 

2058
01:21:17,471 --> 01:21:18,239
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

2059
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:19,441
TWO AREAS IN PARTICULAR WHERE 

2060
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:20,875
THE ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS 

2061
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:23,678
HAS BEEN TOUGH, SANCTIONS AND 

2062
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:25,547
PASSED IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR 

2063
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:27,182
THIS BILL CALLED CATSA WHICH 

2064
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:28,650
FORCES THE PRESIDENT TO PUT 

2065
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:29,617
SANCTIONS PRESIDENT ONLY ON 

2066
01:21:29,617 --> 01:21:31,953
RUSSIA BUT OTHER COUNTRIES AND 

2067
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:38,760
FOR -- BUT ALSO ON UKRAINE úWHE 

2068
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,228
AUTHORIZED THE SENDING OF 

2069
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:41,563
LETHAL WEAPONS THERE IN A MOVE 

2070
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,131
THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 

2071
01:21:43,131 --> 01:21:43,964
REFUSED TO DO. 

2072
01:21:43,964 --> 01:21:46,167
SO THERE'S PLENTY THAT THEY ARE 

2073
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:47,368
DOING TO PUSH BACK AGAINST 

2074
01:21:47,368 --> 01:21:48,603
CONGRESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION 

2075
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:49,938
TO PUSH BACK AGAINST RUSSIA BUT 

2076
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:51,573
IT'S REALLY -- IT COMES DOWN TO 

2077
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:52,207
THE PRESIDENT. 

2078
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:56,945
WHAT'S THE PRESIDENT'S WORD? 

2079
01:21:56,945 --> 01:21:58,113
AND VLAD, IN THE SAME WEEK HE 

2080
01:21:58,113 --> 01:21:59,714
CALLS THE EU A FOE AND SITS 

2081
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:01,349
DOWN WITH THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 

2082
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:01,515
-- 

2083
01:22:01,515 --> 01:22:02,750
>> AND CALLS HIM A COMPETITOR. 

2084
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:03,818
>> YES AND POSSIBLY ONE THAT WE 

2085
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:05,286
CAN SEE MORE OF AS A FRIEND IN 

2086
01:22:05,286 --> 01:22:11,693
THE FUTURE, I THINK THAT'S  

2087
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:12,193
INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC. 

2088
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:13,962
>> WHAT'S A WIN FOR VLADIMIR 

2089
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:14,195
PUTIN? 

2090
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:15,663
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT 

2091
01:22:15,663 --> 01:22:18,133
AREAS I'M SURE HE'S INTERESTED 

2092
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:20,368
IN BUT HOW DOES HE WALK AWAY 

2093
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:22,037
WITH A WIN CONSIDERING THERE 

2094
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:23,738
ISN'T GOING TO BE ANY MAJOR 

2095
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:24,906
CONCRETE DECISIONS MADE HERE? 

2096
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:30,512
>> YOU ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT 

2097
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:30,912
BODY LANGUAGE. 

2098
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:32,380
I THINK VLADIMIR PUTIN COMES TO 

2099
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:33,782
THIS MEETING NOT WANTING TO 

2100
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:35,550
SHOW BOAT ABOUT WHAT HE'S 

2101
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:35,883
ACCOMPLISHED. 

2102
01:22:35,883 --> 01:22:37,318
THERE ARE LITTLE SMIRKS BUT  HE 

2103
01:22:37,318 --> 01:22:37,484
-- 

2104
01:22:37,484 --> 01:22:44,459
>> I POINTED OUT THERE WAS. 

2105
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:45,660
>> THERE WILL BE MORE OF THAT. 

2106
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:46,494
HE'S IN A DELICATE POSITION 

2107
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:48,630
BECAUSE HE HAS ACHIEVED A GREAT 

2108
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,164
DEAL OF WHAT HE HAS DONE IN 

2109
01:22:50,164 --> 01:22:51,533
TERMS OF DIVIDING NATO, IN 

2110
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:54,836
TERMS OF POSSIBLY GETTING 

2111
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:56,204
RUSSIA BACK INTO THE G8, NOW 

2112
01:22:56,204 --> 01:22:58,472
THE G7, IN TERMS OF UKRAINE. 

2113
01:22:58,472 --> 01:23:00,208
HE DOESN'T WANT TO SHOW BOAT 

2114
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,176
BECAUSE CONGRESS IS VERY UPSET 

2115
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:03,078
WITH RUSSIA AND HE DOESN'T WANT 

2116
01:23:03,078 --> 01:23:05,080
TO FLAUNT THAT IN FRONT OF 

2117
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:05,280
THEM. 

2118
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,148
JUST THIS MEETING IS A VERY 

2119
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:07,748
IMPORTANT ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR 

2120
01:23:07,748 --> 01:23:08,783
HIM AND I THINK THERE ARE OTHER 

2121
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:10,051
ISSUES WHERE HE WILL TRY TO 

2122
01:23:10,051 --> 01:23:15,123
WORK OUT SUBTLY ON UKRAINE, 

2123
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:16,123
SYRIA AND IRAN, OTHER THINGS 

2124
01:23:16,123 --> 01:23:18,827
THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH RUSSIAN 

2125
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,462
PREROGATIVES BUT HE'S TRYING TO 

2126
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:22,297
TAMP DOWN EXPECTATIONS A BIT. 

2127
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:23,131
>> WHAT'S INTERESTING TOO THAT 

2128
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:24,399
THE PRESIDENT IN EACH INSTANCE 

2129
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:26,367
WHERE HE'S ASKED ABOUT WHETHER 

2130
01:23:26,367 --> 01:23:30,171
IT'S MEDDLING, WHETHER IT'S 

2131
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:36,111
RUSSIA'S ANNEXATION OF  CRIMEA, 

2132
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:37,712
HE PIVOTS TO BLAMING PRESIDENT 

2133
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:38,846
OBAMA ABOUT THAT. 

2134
01:23:38,846 --> 01:23:41,649
EVEN PRIOR TO THAT PRESIDENT 

2135
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:43,118
BUSH'S ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN 

2136
01:23:43,118 --> 01:23:44,786
PLAYED BY RUSSIA, HE'S 

2137
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:45,553
PRESIDENT CURRENTLY AND WHEN I 

2138
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:49,891
READ A QUOTE LIKE THIS THAT THE 

2139
01:23:49,891 --> 01:23:51,259
GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER, SAID 

2140
01:23:51,259 --> 01:23:52,260
THIS, TO MAINTAIN OUR 

2141
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,061
RELATIONSHIP, OUR PARTNERSHIP 

2142
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:54,195
WITH THE U.S.A. 

2143
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:55,363
WE MUST READJUST IT. 

2144
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:56,831
THE FIRST CLEAR CONSEQUENCE CAN 

2145
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:59,300
ONLY BE THAT WE NEED TO ALIGN 

2146
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,236
OURSELVES MORE CLOSELY IN  

2147
01:24:01,236 --> 01:24:01,469
EUROPE. 

2148
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:03,138
IN OTHER WORDS, THE GERMAN 

2149
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:04,038
FOREIGN MINISTER IS SAYING,  

2150
01:24:04,038 --> 01:24:05,106
LOOK, WITH THE RHETORIC COMING 

2151
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:07,041
OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, WE CAN 

2152
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:08,376
NO LONGER RELY ON THE UNITED 

2153
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,478
STAES AS A RELIABLE PARTNER 

2154
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:12,013
FOR WHAT WE NEED TO DO SO 

2155
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:13,047
THEREFORE, EUROPE NEEDS TO 

2156
01:24:13,047 --> 01:24:14,549
MAINTAIN ITS INTEGRITY BY EVEN 

2157
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:16,150
BECOMING STRONGER THAN EVER. 

2158
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:17,418
IF YOU'RE VLADIMIR PUTIN, ISN'T 

2159
01:24:17,418 --> 01:24:23,591
THAT ONE OF YOUR GOALS TO DRAW 

2160
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:25,226
THE EUROPEANS CLOSER TO RUSSIA 

2161
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:25,893
AND DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM 

2162
01:24:25,893 --> 01:24:26,828
THE UNITED STATES? 

2163
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:28,696
>> YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. 

2164
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:30,264
EMMANUEL MACRON WAS IN RUSSIA 

2165
01:24:30,264 --> 01:24:32,133
FOR THE WORLD CUP FINALE BUT 

2166
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:34,102
ALSO TO TALK WITH THE RUSSIAN 

2167
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:35,103
PRESIDENT ABOUT VARIOUS 

2168
01:24:35,103 --> 01:24:39,006
INTERESTS OF FRANCE AND 

2169
01:24:39,006 --> 01:24:40,041
NETANYAHU IS THERE AS WELL, 

2170
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:41,442
THERE ARE A LOT OF FOREIGN 

2171
01:24:41,442 --> 01:24:43,044
LEADERS GOING TO RUSSIA TO TALK 

2172
01:24:43,044 --> 01:24:43,978
TO VLADIMIR PUTIN AND I THINK 

2173
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:44,645
THAT IS -- 

2174
01:24:44,645 --> 01:24:45,613
>> EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE 

2175
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:47,982
SANCTIONS IN PLACE TOO, PUTIN 

2176
01:24:47,982 --> 01:24:49,083
HAS ACTUALLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT 

2177
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:50,818
HOW TRADE HAS GOTTEN BETTER 

2178
01:24:50,818 --> 01:24:51,653
WITH EUROPE OVER THE PAST 

2179
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:53,354
COUPLE OF MONTHS, EVEN WITH 

2180
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:53,754
THOSE SANCTIONS. 

2181
01:24:53,754 --> 01:24:56,491
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND 

2182
01:24:56,491 --> 01:24:58,293
EUROPE SEIZE SANCTIONS AS -- 

2183
01:24:58,293 --> 01:25:00,561
SEES SANCTIONS AS A COMPLICATED 

2184
01:25:00,561 --> 01:25:02,530
THING, THEY HAVE MUCH MORE 

2185
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:04,332
TRADE RELIANCE BUT MORE BROADLY 

2186
01:25:04,332 --> 01:25:05,567
WITH THE RUSSIANS AND PLENTY OF 

2187
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:07,035
OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE 

2188
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:08,203
INTERESTED IN DOING BUSINESS 

2189
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:08,536
WITH RUSSIA. 

2190
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:14,142
THERE'S A BROADER ISSUE TOO 

2191
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:15,109
ABOUT EUROPE AND THERE ARE 

2192
01:25:15,109 --> 01:25:16,578
PLENTY OF OTHERS WHO ARE 

2193
01:25:16,578 --> 01:25:17,579
LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING ON 

2194
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:18,580
BETWEEN THE NATO SUMMIT AND 

2195
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:19,314
THIS MEETING WITH PUTIN AND 

2196
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:21,049
SAYING WE DO HAVE TO GO IT 

2197
01:25:21,049 --> 01:25:21,282
ALONE. 

2198
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:22,350
MORE THE QUESTION IS, CAN THEY 

2199
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:23,985
DO THAT AND TO WHAT EXTENT ARE 

2200
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:25,119
THEY WILLING TO USE RESOURCES 

2201
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:25,954
TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THEIR 

2202
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:26,854
POSITION IN THE WORLD. 

2203
01:25:26,854 --> 01:25:28,155
>> HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS FOR 

2204
01:25:28,155 --> 01:25:30,325
PUTIN, THE WAY IT PLAYS AT 

2205
01:25:30,325 --> 01:25:30,558
HOME? 

2206
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:31,559
BECAUSE I'M SURPRISED TO HEAR 

2207
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:32,694
THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME 

2208
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:33,428
IMPROVEMENTS IN TRADE BECAUSE 

2209
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:35,997
WE KNOW THAT THE ECONOMY IS 

2210
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:38,233
FALLING APART BECAUSE OF 

2211
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:39,567
SANCTIONS IN RUSSIA. 

2212
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:40,635
SO THIS HAS GOT TO BE SOMETHING 

2213
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:41,903
THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR HIM. 

2214
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:44,605
I KNOW MAYBE THE NEXT ELECTION 

2215
01:25:44,605 --> 01:25:46,608
ISN'T IN QUESTION FOR HIM, 

2216
01:25:46,608 --> 01:25:47,875
PERHAPS, BUT HAVING SUPPORT OF 

2217
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:49,510
THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE HAS TO HAVE 

2218
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:49,743
VALUE. 

2219
01:25:49,743 --> 01:25:53,781
>> YEAH, I THINK PUTIN HAS TWO 

2220
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:54,348
BROAD PREROGATIVES. 

2221
01:25:54,348 --> 01:25:57,385
ONE IS TO MAINTAIN ENOUGH 

2222
01:25:57,385 --> 01:25:58,453
ECONOMIC PROSPERITY THAT HIS 

2223
01:25:58,453 --> 01:25:59,687
POLL NUMBERS AND SUPPORT 

2224
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:01,355
CONTINUES TO GO UP. 

2225
01:26:01,355 --> 01:26:03,057
HE -- THE WORLD CUP WAS A 

2226
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:05,660
MASSIVE SUCCESS FOR HIM BUT 

2227
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:09,964
DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME HE 

2228
01:26:09,964 --> 01:26:13,635
HAS INSTITUTED A CONTROVERSIAL 

2229
01:26:13,635 --> 01:26:14,002
PENSION REFORM. 

2230
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:18,139
ON THE GLOBAL SIDE PUTIN HAS 

2231
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:19,707
BILLED HIMSELF AS DELIVERING 

2232
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:21,175
RUSSIA BACK ONTO THE GLOBAL 

2233
01:26:21,175 --> 01:26:24,145
STAGE, SHOWING IT IS A POWER TO 

2234
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:30,051
BE IF NOT   RECKONED WITH, AT 

2235
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:32,186
LEAST HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. 

2236
01:26:32,186 --> 01:26:33,154
RUSSIA HAS A DEEP SENSE THEY 

2237
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:34,855
SHOULD BE PART OF THE GLOBAL 

2238
01:26:34,855 --> 01:26:35,389
CONVERSATION, THEY ARE 

2239
01:26:35,389 --> 01:26:36,123
IMPORTANT POWER AND PUTIN IS 

2240
01:26:36,123 --> 01:26:37,225
LIVING UP TO THAT AND BY 

2241
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:39,127
MEETING WITH THE U.S. 

2242
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:39,427
PRESIDENT. 

2243
01:26:39,427 --> 01:26:41,362
>> IN YOUR ANALYSIS, GIVEN 

2244
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:44,132
THAT, LOOK, WE ALL KNOW THAT 

2245
01:26:44,132 --> 01:26:46,334
PRESIDENT TRUMP FANCIES HIMSELF 

2246
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:47,835
AS A DEAL MAKER, GENERALLY WHEN 

2247
01:26:47,835 --> 01:26:51,973
HE COMES OUT OF THESE MEETINGS, 

2248
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:55,143
WHETHER IT'S WITH KIM JONG-UN, 

2249
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:56,311
NATO, EU LEADERS, HE COMES OUT 

2250
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:57,478
AND SUGGESTS TO THE WORLD, 

2251
01:26:57,478 --> 01:26:58,579
THROUGH THE MEDIA, HERE'S WHAT 

2252
01:26:58,579 --> 01:27:00,047
WE  AGREED, WE HAVE GOTTEN THIS 

2253
01:27:00,047 --> 01:27:00,915
AND IT'S A WIN. 

2254
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:02,116
HE WANTS TO BE ABLE TO COME 

2255
01:27:02,116 --> 01:27:03,451
BACK TO THE UNITED STATES 

2256
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:05,687
SAYING, LOOK WHAT I DID, I 

2257
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:06,120
ACCOMPLISHED THAT. 

2258
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,622
THIS IS SUCH A DELICATE MEETING 

2259
01:27:07,622 --> 01:27:10,558
WITH SUCH HIGH STAKES AT PLAY, 

2260
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:13,328
I JUST WONDER, AND I'M -- I'M 

2261
01:27:13,328 --> 01:27:15,496
ASKING YOU TO SPECULATE HERE 

2262
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:16,631
BUT JUST GIVEN THE TRACK RECORD 

2263
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:18,132
AND GIVEN THE HISTORY, GIVEN 

2264
01:27:18,132 --> 01:27:19,500
THE FACT THAT HE CAME OUT OF 

2265
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,169
THAT MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN 

2266
01:27:21,169 --> 01:27:23,237
AND SAID, LOOK, WE ARE GOING TO 

2267
01:27:23,237 --> 01:27:24,972
SUSPEND MILITARY OPERATIONS, 

2268
01:27:24,972 --> 01:27:25,572
MILITARY DRILLS WITH SOUTH  

2269
01:27:25,572 --> 01:27:27,575
KOREA, WHICH WAS NEWS TO THE 

2270
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:28,843
SOUTH KOREANS, SOMETHING THAT 

2271
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:30,445
PYONGYANG HAD WANTED FOR  

2272
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:30,712
DECADES. 

2273
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:31,813
HE BASICALLY GAVE THAT UP IN A 

2274
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:32,747
PRESS CONFERENCE THAT HE 

2275
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:34,048
DELIVERED RIGHT AFTER THE 

2276
01:27:34,048 --> 01:27:36,451
MEETING WAS BARELY OVER. 

2277
01:27:36,451 --> 01:27:39,187
COULD THAT BE A PROBLEM FOR THE 

2278
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:39,554
UNITED STATES? 

2279
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:41,889
>> THERE ARE MULTIPLE RISKS. 

2280
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:43,056
YOU MENTIONED MILITARY  

2281
01:27:43,056 --> 01:27:50,298
EXERCISES, THERE ARE JOINT U.S. 

2282
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:51,766
COULD BE GIVEN UP IN A SIMILAR 

2283
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:51,966
WAY. 

2284
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:53,000
I THINK OTHER ISSUES YOU COULD 

2285
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,068
SEE ARE ON UKRAINE. 

2286
01:27:55,068 --> 01:27:58,806
PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED CRIMEA, 

2287
01:27:58,806 --> 01:28:00,441
IF HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE 

2288
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:03,110
ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA AND SAYS 

2289
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:03,511
-- 

2290
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:04,712
>> YOU KNOW THAT QUESTION IS 

2291
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:05,446
GOING TO COME UP. 

2292
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:06,947
IF THERE'S A PRESS CONFERENCE 

2293
01:28:06,947 --> 01:28:08,482
THEY ARE GOING TO ASK THE 

2294
01:28:08,482 --> 01:28:11,486
PRESIDENT WHAT IS THE UNITED 

2295
01:28:11,486 --> 01:28:13,988
STATES' POSITION ON CRIMEA. 

2296
01:28:13,988 --> 01:28:16,156
YOU'RE NOT IN THE U.K. 

2297
01:28:16,156 --> 01:28:17,091
YOU'RE ON THE WORLD STAGE WITH 

2298
01:28:17,091 --> 01:28:18,626
THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT, THE MAN 

2299
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:22,663
WHO ANNEXED CRIMEA FROM 

2300
01:28:22,663 --> 01:28:23,064
UKRAINE. 

2301
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:24,132
IF HE PIVOTS, IF HE DOES 

2302
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,266
ANYTHING IT'S GOING TO BE 

2303
01:28:25,266 --> 01:28:25,566
REMARKABLE. 

2304
01:28:25,566 --> 01:28:28,002
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND I 

2305
01:28:28,002 --> 01:28:30,271
THINK -- I MEAN, IN THE CONTEXT 

2306
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:31,939
OF UKRAINE, THE DE FACTO 

2307
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:33,241
SITUATION IS THE RUSSIANS DO 

2308
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:33,541
CONTROL IT. 

2309
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:35,443
BUT I THINK THE IDEA THAT A 

2310
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:36,043
PRESIDENT -- U.S. PRESIDENT 

2311
01:28:36,043 --> 01:28:37,879
WOULD COME OUT AND SAY THAT 

2312
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:42,216
IT'S -- ONE, WE ACKNOWLEDGE A 

2313
01:28:42,216 --> 01:28:43,117
TERRITORIAL INCURSION AND 

2314
01:28:43,117 --> 01:28:44,085
BASICALLY STEALING OF LAND FROM 

2315
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:45,986
A NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, ONE THAT 

2316
01:28:45,986 --> 01:28:47,622
U.S. HAS COMMITTED TO, AT LEAST 

2317
01:28:47,622 --> 01:28:50,157
WITH RESPECT TO TERRITORIAL 

2318
01:28:50,157 --> 01:28:52,393
SOVEREIGNTY WILL BE REMARKABLE 

2319
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:54,162
BECAUSE MAYBE GIVE RUSSIA SORT 

2320
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:55,462
OF CAUSER AT LARGE TO DO THINGS 

2321
01:28:55,462 --> 01:28:58,032
IN OTHER PARTS OF ITS NEAR 

2322
01:28:58,032 --> 01:29:01,269
ABROAD, IN GEORGIA, IN THE 

2323
01:29:01,269 --> 01:29:02,437
BALTICS, THAT WOULD MAKE NATO 

2324
01:29:02,437 --> 01:29:04,838
ALLIES AND U.S. ALLIES FEARFUL. 

2325
01:29:04,838 --> 01:29:08,543
>> SO THE PRESIDENT AND --  

2326
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:10,378
BOTHMENTS, PUTIN AND TRUMP -- 

2327
01:29:10,378 --> 01:29:12,346
BOTH PRESIDENTS, PUTIN AND  

2328
01:29:12,346 --> 01:29:14,015
TRUMP, SPOKE EARLIER. 

2329
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,149
PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF SOUND SO 

2330
01:29:15,149 --> 01:29:17,318
YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF WHAT THE 

2331
01:29:17,318 --> 01:29:18,052
PRESIDENT THINKS THIS MEETING 

2332
01:29:18,052 --> 01:29:18,552
WILL BE ABOUT. 

2333
01:29:18,552 --> 01:29:19,821
>> WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS 

2334
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:22,557
TO TALK ABOUT AND THINGS TO 

2335
01:29:22,557 --> 01:29:23,056
TALK ABOUT. 

2336
01:29:23,056 --> 01:29:24,091
WE HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON 

2337
01:29:24,091 --> 01:29:25,693
EVERYTHING FROM TRADE TO 

2338
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:28,830
MILITARY TO MISSILES TO NUCLEAR 

2339
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:30,130
TO CHINA TO -- WE WILL BE 

2340
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:33,334
TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT  

2341
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:37,839
CHINA, OUR MUTUAL FRIEND, 

2342
01:29:37,839 --> 01:29:38,906
PRESIDENT XI. 

2343
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:40,141
I THINK WE HAVE GREAT 

2344
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:41,108
OPPORTUNITIES AS TWO COUNTRIES 

2345
01:29:41,108 --> 01:29:42,777
THAT FRANKLY WE HAVE NOT BEEN 

2346
01:29:42,777 --> 01:29:44,278
GETTING ALONG FOR THE LAST 

2347
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:45,779
NUMBER OF YEARS. 

2348
01:29:45,779 --> 01:29:47,849
I HAVE NOT BEEN HERE TOO LONG 

2349
01:29:47,849 --> 01:29:49,217
BUT IT'S GETTING CLOSER TO TWO 

2350
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:50,785
YEARS BUT I THINK WE WILL END 

2351
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:52,219
UP HAVING AN EXTRAORDINARY 

2352
01:29:52,219 --> 01:29:52,553
RELATIONSHIP. 

2353
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:54,455
I HAVE BEEN SAYING AND I'M SURE 

2354
01:29:54,455 --> 01:29:55,389
YOU'VE HEARD OVER THE YEARS AND 

2355
01:29:55,389 --> 01:29:56,591
AS I COMPLAINED THAT GETTING 

2356
01:29:56,591 --> 01:29:57,692
ALONG WITH RUSSIA IS A GOOD 

2357
01:29:57,692 --> 01:29:59,526
THING, NOT A BAD THING. 

2358
01:29:59,526 --> 01:30:01,295
AND I REALLY THINK THE WORLD 

2359
01:30:01,295 --> 01:30:03,530
WANTS TO SEE US GET ALONG. 

2360
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:05,533
WE ARE THE TWO GREAT NUCLEAR 

2361
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:05,766
POWERS. 

2362
01:30:05,766 --> 01:30:08,669
WE HAVE 90% OF THE NUCLEAR AND 

2363
01:30:08,669 --> 01:30:09,870
THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING. 

2364
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:10,971
IT'S A BAD THING. 

2365
01:30:10,971 --> 01:30:13,074
AND I THINK WE HOPEFULLY CAN DO 

2366
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,842
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BECAUSE 

2367
01:30:14,842 --> 01:30:16,043
IT'S NOT A POSITIVE FORCE. 

2368
01:30:16,043 --> 01:30:17,044
IT'S A NEGATIVE FORCE. 

2369
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:18,179
SO WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT 

2370
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:20,381
THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS. 

2371
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:21,749
>> SO THERE THE PRESIDENT WENT 

2372
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:23,384
THROUGH A WHOLE LIST OF STUFF, 

2373
01:30:23,384 --> 01:30:25,486
SOME THINGS, OBVIOUSLY, NOT 

2374
01:30:25,486 --> 01:30:27,755
THERE, LIKE CRIMEA, LIKE SYRIA. 

2375
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:29,924
HE DID FINISH OFF BY TALKING 

2376
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:30,491
ABOUT NUCLEAR PROCEED LIVE 

2377
01:30:30,491 --> 01:30:36,163
VACATION AND THAT IT'S -- 

2378
01:30:36,163 --> 01:30:38,266
NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION AND IT'S 

2379
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:38,699
BAD. 

2380
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:39,500
HE REITERATED THIS IDEA THAT 

2381
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,035
IT'S A GOOD THING IF AMERICA 

2382
01:30:41,035 --> 01:30:42,870
GETS ALONG WITH RUSSIA, RIGHT, 

2383
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:43,203
VERY SIMPLE? 

2384
01:30:43,203 --> 01:30:45,606
IS IT A GOOD THING AND IS IT 

2385
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:47,608
POSSIBLE WITH PUTIN AS THE 

2386
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:47,908
PRESIDENT? 

2387
01:30:47,908 --> 01:30:50,278
>> IT IS ABSOLUTELY A GOOD  

2388
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:54,081
THING, BUT IT'S PLAGUED, IT'S 

2389
01:30:54,081 --> 01:30:55,216
TROUBLED EVERY SINGLE U.S. 

2390
01:30:55,216 --> 01:30:56,684
PRESIDENT FOR THE LAST FEW 

2391
01:30:56,684 --> 01:30:56,951
DECADES. 

2392
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:58,085
WE HAVE SEEN WITH OBAMA, WITH 

2393
01:30:58,085 --> 01:31:01,322
BUSH, WITH PRESIDENTS OF EITHER 

2394
01:31:01,322 --> 01:31:02,456
PARTY, USUALLY AN ATTEMPT 

2395
01:31:02,456 --> 01:31:03,391
WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR TO GET 

2396
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:07,929
ALONG WITH RUSSIA AND THEN SOME 

2397
01:31:07,929 --> 01:31:11,065
CRISIS UKRAINE, GEORGIA, THE 

2398
01:31:11,065 --> 01:31:15,469
SHOOTING DOWN OF AIRCRAFTS OVER 

2399
01:31:15,469 --> 01:31:16,771
UKRAINE, BLOW IT UP. 

2400
01:31:16,771 --> 01:31:18,439
WE ARE AT AT CRISIS IN TERMS OF 

2401
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:20,408
THE U.S. AND ELECTION AND 

2402
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:22,209
RUSSIAN'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE 

2403
01:31:22,209 --> 01:31:22,776
U.S. ELECTION. 

2404
01:31:22,776 --> 01:31:24,077
THE VERY FACT THIS MEETING 

2405
01:31:24,077 --> 01:31:25,513
HAPPENING PROBABLY WOULDN'T 

2406
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:26,747
HAVE HAPPENED OVER MOST U.S. 

2407
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:28,115
PRESIDENTS AND I THINK THE U.S. 

2408
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:29,650
AND RUSSIA SHOULD GET ALONG. 

2409
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:32,320
THERE ARE PLENTY OF ISSUES, 

2410
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,321
NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION BEING THE 

2411
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:34,055
MOST IMPORTANT WHERE WE CAN 

2412
01:31:34,055 --> 01:31:35,456
WORK TOGETHER BUT THE QUESTION 

2413
01:31:35,456 --> 01:31:38,092
IS ON WHAT TERMS, RIGHT? 

2414
01:31:38,092 --> 01:31:38,359
>> YEAH. 

2415
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:39,593
>> IT IS INTERESTING, GABE, 

2416
01:31:39,593 --> 01:31:40,828
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE 

2417
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:42,129
TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE, I'M A 

2418
01:31:42,129 --> 01:31:43,264
STUDENT OF HISTORY AND AS YOU 

2419
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:45,766
LOOK BACK AT THE NUMBER OF 

2420
01:31:45,766 --> 01:31:47,368
PRESIDENTS WHO HAD HAD TO DEAL 

2421
01:31:47,368 --> 01:31:48,635
WITH RUSSIAN LEADERS WHETHER IT 

2422
01:31:48,635 --> 01:31:51,072
WAS UNDER THE SOVIET UNION OR 

2423
01:31:51,072 --> 01:31:52,974
AS RUSSIA AS THE RUSSIAN  

2424
01:31:52,974 --> 01:31:57,111
FEDERATION, IT'S BUT FRAUGHT 

2425
01:31:57,111 --> 01:31:57,511
WITH DANGEROUS. 

2426
01:31:57,511 --> 01:31:58,446
PRESIDENT OBAMA SUGGESTED THAT 

2427
01:31:58,446 --> 01:32:01,315
RUSSIAN WAS A SECOND -- RUSSIA 

2428
01:32:01,315 --> 01:32:02,283
WAS A SECOND RATE NATION. 

2429
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:04,051
IT WAS SORT OF TO SUGGEST THAT 

2430
01:32:04,051 --> 01:32:06,921
RUSSIA WAS NOT EVEN A FACTOR IN 

2431
01:32:06,921 --> 01:32:09,056
GEO POLITICS ANYMORE -- 

2432
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:09,957
>> WHICH PROBABLY CONTRIBUTED 

2433
01:32:09,957 --> 01:32:11,125
TO THE BAD RELATIONSHIP HE HAD 

2434
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:11,692
WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN. 

2435
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:12,426
>> OF COURSE IT DID. 

2436
01:32:12,426 --> 01:32:14,094
IT WAS A FUNDAMENTAL MISREADING 

2437
01:32:14,094 --> 01:32:18,299
OF WHAT RUSSIA -- WHAT RUSSIA'S 

2438
01:32:18,299 --> 01:32:19,166
NATIONAL INTERESTS ARE AS IT 

2439
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:20,868
RELATES TO THE REST OF THE  

2440
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:21,268
WORLD. 

2441
01:32:21,268 --> 01:32:23,004
AND I WONDER, WE SAY, LOOK, 

2442
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:23,938
VLADIMIR PUTIN DOESN'T HAVE TO 

2443
01:32:23,938 --> 01:32:25,339
WORRY ABOUT POLLS, HE DOESN'T 

2444
01:32:25,339 --> 01:32:26,540
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT REELECTION. 

2445
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:27,708
HE CAN DO WHAT HE WANTS. 

2446
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:28,976
HE'S GOT A BROAD BRUSH TO DO 

2447
01:32:28,976 --> 01:32:30,511
WHAT HE WANTS. 

2448
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:33,714
WHEREAS AMERICAN PRESIDENTS 

2449
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:36,517
HAVE OUR -- ARE BEHOLDEN TO THE 

2450
01:32:36,517 --> 01:32:37,518
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND ELECTIONS 

2451
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:38,986
SO THAT, I THINK, MAKES IT FEEL 

2452
01:32:38,986 --> 01:32:40,788
AS IF THE RUSSIANS HAVE A LONG 

2453
01:32:40,788 --> 01:32:42,723
GAME AND THAT GAME ISN'T 

2454
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:45,226
PREDICATED ON THE 2020 MIDTERMS 

2455
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:46,960
-- SORRY, THE 2018 MIDTERMS OR 

2456
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,128
THE 2020 ELECTIONS. 

2457
01:32:48,128 --> 01:32:49,363
IT'S PREDICATED ON WHERE RUSSIA 

2458
01:32:49,363 --> 01:32:51,132
WILL BE STANDING ON THE WORLD 

2459
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:52,433
STAGE IN YEARS AND PERHAPS EVEN 

2460
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:53,800
DECADES TO COME. 

2461
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,001
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS? 

2462
01:32:55,001 --> 01:32:56,703
>> I THINK -- WELL, FOR PUTIN, 

2463
01:32:56,703 --> 01:32:58,773
AGAIN, IT IS THIS IDEA OF 

2464
01:32:58,773 --> 01:32:59,974
DELIVERING RUSSIA BACK ONTO THE 

2465
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:01,275
GLOBAL STAGE BUT IT'S BROADER 

2466
01:33:01,275 --> 01:33:01,676
THAN THAT.  

2467
01:33:01,676 --> 01:33:05,112
IT'S ABOUT  REASSERTING ITS 

2468
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:06,880
INFLUENCE IN POST SOVIET 

2469
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:07,748
STATES, STATES THAT WERE 

2470
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:10,384
PREVIOUSLY PART OF THE SOVIET 

2471
01:33:10,384 --> 01:33:10,617
UNION. 

2472
01:33:10,617 --> 01:33:11,718
IT'S ABOUT REASSERTING ITS 

2473
01:33:11,718 --> 01:33:12,887
INFLUENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST IN 

2474
01:33:12,887 --> 01:33:15,122
PARTICULAR, AND THAT'S WHAT THE 

2475
01:33:15,122 --> 01:33:17,091
WARDEN SERIES IS ABOUT, NOT 

2476
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:18,859
ONLY PROPPING UP SUPPORT FOR 

2477
01:33:18,859 --> 01:33:19,927
ASSAD BUT ALSO IN OTHER PARTS 

2478
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:23,831
OF THE WORLD AND BEING A SORT 

2479
01:33:23,831 --> 01:33:25,565
OF EXPANDING RUSSIAN COMMERCE 

2480
01:33:25,565 --> 01:33:26,533
AROUND THE WORLD. 

2481
01:33:26,533 --> 01:33:28,002
WE SEE, FOR EXAMPLE, 

2482
01:33:28,002 --> 01:33:30,104
COOPERATION BETWEEN RUSSIA AND 

2483
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:31,271
VENEZUELA AND OTHER COUNTRIES 

2484
01:33:31,271 --> 01:33:33,440
IN AFRICA AND THIS IDEA THAT 

2485
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:37,545
RUSSIA IS NOT AS, I THINK, 

2486
01:33:37,545 --> 01:33:38,646
OBAMA MISTAKENLY CHARACTERIZED 

2487
01:33:38,646 --> 01:33:39,914
IT A SECOND RATE POWER BUT IT 

2488
01:33:39,914 --> 01:33:42,183
IS A GLOBAL PLAYER BOTH IN 

2489
01:33:42,183 --> 01:33:44,551
ECONOMICS AND POLITICS. 

2490
01:33:44,551 --> 01:33:46,653
>> GABE LIPTON, THANK YOU SO 

2491
01:33:46,653 --> 01:33:46,854
MUCH. 

2492
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:47,488
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO 

2493
01:33:47,488 --> 01:33:49,824
BE WITH US FOR THE REST OF THE 

2494
01:33:49,824 --> 01:33:50,024
DAY. 

2495
01:33:50,024 --> 01:33:51,125
>> I DON'T KNOW BUT WE CAN CHAT 

2496
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:51,325
MORE. 

2497
01:33:51,325 --> 01:33:52,793
>> WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

2498
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:53,026
BREAK. 

2499
01:33:53,026 --> 01:33:53,861

WE ARE EXPECTING A PRESS

CONFERENCE AFTER THE TWO 

2505

LEADERS MEET. 

2506
01:33:59,533 --> 01:34:00,801
WE ARE GOING TO BRING THAT TO

LATEST CHART TOPPING ALBUM BY

THE KILLERS. 

2514
01:37:10,557 --> 01:37:12,826
NO, THE BAND IS NOT AT ALL AS 

2515
01:37:12,826 --> 01:37:15,195
MENACING AS THEIR NAME 

2516
01:37:15,195 --> 01:37:15,462

HE IS NOT NEW TO THIS. 

2983
01:57:16,796 --> 01:57:17,830
THIS IS THE THIRD U.S. 

2984
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:18,831
PRESIDENT HE HAS DEALT WITH. 

2985
01:57:18,831 --> 01:57:21,567
>> Reporter: PRESIDENT BUSH 

2986
01:57:21,567 --> 01:57:23,169
SAID THAT HE SAW INTO HIS SOUL, 

2987
01:57:23,169 --> 01:57:26,272
I THINK HE REGRETTED THAT. 

2988
01:57:26,272 --> 01:57:30,042
HE SAID VLADIMIR PUTIN TOYED 

2989
01:57:30,042 --> 01:57:30,843
WITH OBAMA. 

2990
01:57:30,843 --> 01:57:34,514
>> I'VE MET HIM TWO TIMES, MOST 

2991
01:57:34,514 --> 01:57:36,115
OF YOU PEOPLE WERE THERE WHEN I 

2992
01:57:36,115 --> 01:57:36,482
MET HIM. 

2993
01:57:36,482 --> 01:57:45,291
I THINK THAT I MAY HAVE A VERY 

2994
01:57:45,291 --> 01:57:46,325
GOOD RELATIONSHIP, AND I THINK 

2995
01:57:46,325 --> 01:57:47,460
I MAY HAVE A VERY BAD 

2996
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:49,896
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. 

2997
01:57:49,896 --> 01:57:50,563
I'VE NO IDEA. 

2998
01:57:50,563 --> 01:57:51,730
I LOVE THAT THE UNITED STATES. 

2999
01:57:51,730 --> 01:57:52,598
HE OBVIOUSLY LOVES RUSSIA. 

3000
01:57:52,598 --> 01:57:55,234
HE IS FOR RUSSIA; I AM FOR THE 

3001
01:57:55,234 --> 01:58:00,940
U.S. WE WILL SEE WHAT COMES OF 

3002
01:58:00,940 --> 01:58:01,106
IT. 

3003
01:58:01,106 --> 01:58:02,475
WE HAVE A CHANCE FOR A VERY 

3004
01:58:02,475 --> 01:58:02,908
GOOD RELATIONSHIP. 

3005
01:58:02,908 --> 01:58:04,310
THE COUPLE OF TIMES I MET HIM, 

3006
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:07,380
WE GOT ALONG VERY WELL. 

3007
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:08,748
IF I GOT ALONG WITH THEM, THAT 

3008
01:58:08,748 --> 01:58:09,615
IS A GOOD THING. 

3009
01:58:09,615 --> 01:58:11,083
WE ARE A MAGNIFICENT POWERFUL 

3010
01:58:11,083 --> 01:58:11,350
COUNTRY. 

3011
01:58:11,350 --> 01:58:13,585
THEY ARE A VERY POWERFUL 

3012
01:58:13,585 --> 01:58:14,086
COUNTRY. 

3013
01:58:14,086 --> 01:58:19,559
WE ARE BOTH NUCLEAR COUNTRIES. 

3014
01:58:19,559 --> 01:58:20,826
GETTING ALONG IS A GOOD THING, 

3015
01:58:20,826 --> 01:58:22,028
NOT A BAD THING. 

3016
01:58:22,028 --> 01:58:23,062
BUT MAKE THE RUSSIANS INDICTED, 

3017
01:58:23,062 --> 01:58:25,097
WOULD YOU ASK VLADIMIR PUTIN TO 

3018
01:58:25,097 --> 01:58:28,100
SEND THEM HERE? 

3019
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:28,801
>> I MIGHT. 

3020
01:58:28,801 --> 01:58:34,473
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT. 

3021
01:58:34,473 --> 01:58:35,374
THIS WAS DURING THE OBAMA 

3022
01:58:35,374 --> 01:58:35,741
ADMINISTRATION. 

3023
01:58:35,741 --> 01:58:36,842
THEY WERE DOING WHATEVER IT WAS 

3024
01:58:36,842 --> 01:58:37,577
DURING THE OBAMA 

3025
01:58:37,577 --> 01:58:37,944
ADMINISTRATION. 

3026
01:58:37,944 --> 01:58:38,844
I HEARD THAT THEY WERE TRYING 

3027
01:58:38,844 --> 01:58:40,613
OR PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO HACK 

3028
01:58:40,613 --> 01:58:42,748
INTO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL 

3029
01:58:42,748 --> 01:58:45,585
COMMITTEE AS WELL, BUT WE HAD 

3030
01:58:45,585 --> 01:58:50,623
MUCH BETTER DEFENSES. 

3031
01:58:50,623 --> 01:58:51,958
I THINK THE DNC SHOULD BE 

3032
01:58:51,958 --> 01:58:53,726
ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR 

3033
01:58:53,726 --> 01:58:54,926
ALLOWING THEMSELVES TO BE 

3034
01:58:54,926 --> 01:58:56,128
HACKED. 

3035
01:58:56,128 --> 01:59:02,268
>> THE GOAL OF THE MEETING, HE 

3036
01:59:02,268 --> 01:59:07,139
SAID HE WOULD TELL US AFTER. 

3037
01:59:07,139 --> 01:59:08,274
WE ASKED ABOUT THE TONE HE 

3038
01:59:08,274 --> 01:59:09,141
WOULD LIKE TO STRIKE. 

3039
01:59:09,141 --> 01:59:09,976
HE BROUGHT UP INVESTIGATIONS 

3040
01:59:09,976 --> 01:59:10,776
AND SAYING THEY HAMPER 

3041
01:59:10,776 --> 01:59:12,177
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND 

3042
01:59:12,177 --> 01:59:12,611
RUSSIA. 

3043
01:59:12,611 --> 01:59:14,347
I ALSO ASKED THE PRESIDENT AT 

3044
01:59:14,347 --> 01:59:15,448
ONE POINT WHO HE THOUGHT 

3045
01:59:15,448 --> 01:59:20,319
AMERICA'S BIGGEST GLOBAL FOE  

3046
01:59:20,319 --> 01:59:25,024
IS AT THIS POINT. 

3047
01:59:25,024 --> 01:59:27,660
>> I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF 

3048
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:30,296
OPPONENTS, THE EUROPEAN UNION 

3049
01:59:30,296 --> 01:59:35,935
IS A FOE.  

3050
01:59:35,935 --> 01:59:37,469
WHAT THEY DO TO US WITH TRADE. 

3051
01:59:37,469 --> 01:59:43,042
RUSSIA IS A FOE IN  CERTAIN 

3052
01:59:43,042 --> 01:59:44,042
RESPECTS, CHINA AS WELL, THAT 

3053
01:59:44,042 --> 01:59:45,077
DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE BAD. 

3054
01:59:45,077 --> 01:59:46,112
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING, IT 

3055
01:59:46,112 --> 01:59:53,252
MEANS THEY ARE COMPETITORS. 

3056
01:59:53,252 --> 01:59:54,687
THEY WANT TO DO WELL, AND WE 

3057
01:59:54,687 --> 01:59:55,421
WANT TO DO WELL. 

3058
01:59:55,421 --> 01:59:56,922
>> I FOLLOWED UP AND SAID SOME 

3059
01:59:56,922 --> 01:59:58,123
PEOPLE MAY BE SURPRISED TO HEAR 

3060
01:59:58,123 --> 02:00:00,059
YOU LISTED THE EU AS THE FIRST 

3061
02:00:00,059 --> 02:00:05,031
FOE . HE DOUBLED DOWN. 

3062
02:00:05,031 --> 02:00:06,499
HE SAID THIS IS THE FOCUS RIGHT 

3063
02:00:06,499 --> 02:00:07,667
NOW FOR HIM AND THE 

3064
02:00:07,667 --> 02:00:08,434
ADMINISTRATION IS ON THIS 

3065
02:00:08,434 --> 02:00:09,935
TRADE, ON REDOING THESE DEALS 

3066
02:00:09,935 --> 02:00:13,739
AND THE NATO PAYMENTS. 

3067
02:00:13,739 --> 02:00:15,508
HE STOOD BY THAT. 

3068
02:00:15,508 --> 02:00:20,846
>> BUT THEN YOU RESPONDED, BUT 

3069
02:00:20,846 --> 02:00:23,716
IF ANYONE SAYS THAT WE ARE IF OH

3070
02:00:23,716 --> 02:00:29,955
-- THAT WE ARE A FOE, YOU SAY 

3071
02:00:29,955 --> 02:00:32,658
IT IS FAKE NEWS.  

3072
02:00:32,658 --> 02:00:35,761
>> IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE EU

3073
02:00:35,761 --> 02:00:36,929
INJECTED ITSELF INTO THE DEBATE 

3074
02:00:36,929 --> 02:00:37,797
AS WELL. 

3075
02:00:37,797 --> 02:00:48,641
CLEARLY, IT IS A TOPIC THAT IS 

3076
02:00:48,641 --> 02:00:49,709
RUBBING SOME FOLKS THE WRONG 

3077
02:00:49,709 --> 02:00:50,476
WAY ON BOTH SIDES. 

3078
02:00:50,476 --> 02:00:51,911
BUT IT IS ONE THAT I DON'T 

3079
02:00:51,911 --> 02:00:52,945
THINK, AS WE'VE SEEN CLEARLY, 

3080
02:00:52,945 --> 02:00:54,113
THE PRESIDENT WILL LET GO OF 

3081
02:00:54,113 --> 02:00:54,980
RIGHT NOW. 

3082
02:00:54,980 --> 02:00:56,982
>> YOU CAN SEE MORE OF HIS 

3083
02:00:56,982 --> 02:00:59,218
CONVERSATIONS TONIGHT ON THE 

3084
02:00:59,218 --> 02:01:00,652
CBS EVENING NEWS AND ON 

3085
02:01:00,652 --> 02:01:02,254
WEDNESDAY. THE PRESIDENT WILL 

3086
02:01:02,254 --> 02:01:05,791
SIT DOWN WITH JEFF FOR A SECOND 

3087
02:01:05,791 --> 02:01:09,362
POST SUMMIT INTERVIEW IN 

3088
02:01:09,362 --> 02:01:10,262
WASHINGTON. 

3089
02:01:10,262 --> 02:01:12,698
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MEETING 

3090
02:01:12,698 --> 02:01:14,133
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS RIGHT NOW. 

3091
02:01:14,133 --> 02:01:19,105
LET'S GO BACK TO NORA. 

3092
02:01:19,105 --> 02:01:23,409
>> Reporter: GOOD ONE. 

3093
02:01:23,409 --> 02:01:24,210
THE PRIVATE MEETING BETWEEN 

3094
02:01:24,210 --> 02:01:26,679
THEM IS EXPECTED TO LAST AN 

3095
02:01:26,679 --> 02:01:32,952
HOUR AND A HALF. 

3096
02:01:32,952 --> 02:01:33,919
RESIDENT TRUMP WHO BRAGS ABOUT 

3097
02:01:33,919 --> 02:01:35,388
HIS ABILITY TO MAKE A DEAL IS 

3098
02:01:35,388 --> 02:01:36,856
SITTING ON WITH ONE OF THE MOST 

3099
02:01:36,856 --> 02:01:37,590
EXPERIENCED PLAYERS ON THE 

3100
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:38,123
WORLD STAGE. 

3101
02:01:38,123 --> 02:01:39,458
DURING HIS TIME IN POWER, HE IS 

3102
02:01:39,458 --> 02:01:40,459
MET WITH EVERY U.S. PRESIDENT 

3103
02:01:40,459 --> 02:01:45,564
SINCE BILL CLINTON. 

3104
02:01:45,564 --> 02:01:46,799
GEORGE BUSH SAID HE LOOKED INTO 

3105
02:01:46,799 --> 02:01:48,801
HIS EYES TO GET A SENSE OF HIS 

3106
02:01:48,801 --> 02:01:55,341
SOUL. 

3107
02:01:55,341 --> 02:01:56,509
NONE OF THESE LEADERS IN THE 

3108
02:01:56,509 --> 02:01:57,877
PAST SAID THEY WANTED TO HAVE A 

3109
02:01:57,877 --> 02:01:58,711
GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. 

3110
02:01:58,711 --> 02:02:02,348
>> HE IS A CIPHER. HE CAME 

3111
02:02:02,348 --> 02:02:08,187
SEEMINGLY OUT OF NOWHERE. 

3112
02:02:08,187 --> 02:02:12,958
EVERYONE SINCE THEN HAS BEEN 

3113
02:02:12,958 --> 02:02:14,159
TRYING TO READ THE TEA LEAVES 

3114
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:16,195
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF GUY 

3115
02:02:16,195 --> 02:02:18,063
HE IS. 

3116
02:02:18,063 --> 02:02:22,535
BUT HE IS VERY PRIVATE. 

3117
02:02:22,535 --> 02:02:29,575
BEFORE THERE IS KREMLIN APOLOGY 

3118
02:02:29,575 --> 02:02:35,281
-- THE STUDY OF KREMLIN, BUT 

3119
02:02:35,281 --> 02:02:43,856
NOW HE IS HIS OWN CIPHER. 

3120
02:02:43,856 --> 02:02:44,923
>> VLADIMIR PUTIN IS OFTEN 

3121
02:02:44,923 --> 02:02:45,925
CALLED A MODERN-DAY CZAR HE 

3122
02:02:45,925 --> 02:02:51,597
WALKS LIKE A MAN IN CHARGE. 

3123
02:02:51,597 --> 02:02:53,032
HE WAS TRAINED AS A KGB AGENT, 

3124
02:02:53,032 --> 02:03:00,473
AND IT IS IN HIS DNA TO VIEW 

3125
02:03:00,473 --> 02:03:01,507
THE UNITED STATES AS AN 

3126
02:03:01,507 --> 02:03:01,807
ADVERSARY. 

3127
02:03:01,807 --> 02:03:02,874
HE IS AN OLD FASHION HE-MAN, 

3128
02:03:02,874 --> 02:03:03,742
THE OPPOSITE OF POLITICALLY 

3129
02:03:03,742 --> 02:03:03,975
CORECT. 

3130
02:03:03,975 --> 02:03:04,743
HIS NEGOTIATING TACTICS INCLUDE 

3131
02:03:04,743 --> 02:03:05,177
MIND GAMES. 

3132
02:03:05,177 --> 02:03:11,283
HE ONCE TOOK HIS DOG TO A 

3133
02:03:11,283 --> 02:03:12,251
MEETING WITH ANGELA MERKEL WHO 

3134
02:03:12,251 --> 02:03:13,652
IS AFRAID OF THEM AND HE KEPT 

3135
02:03:13,652 --> 02:03:15,120
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAITING FOR 40 

3136
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:20,793
MINUTES. 

3137
02:03:20,793 --> 02:03:22,228
HE IS ALSO A POPULIST WHO CAN 

3138
02:03:22,228 --> 02:03:23,295
TURN ON THE CHARM ESPECIALLY 

3139
02:03:23,295 --> 02:03:24,296
DURING HIS EPIC ASK THE 

3140
02:03:24,296 --> 02:03:25,097
PRESIDENT CALL IN SHOWS. 

3141
02:03:25,097 --> 02:03:26,131
HE LOVES WEALTH AND THE 

3142
02:03:26,131 --> 02:03:27,733
TRAPPINGS OF POWER AT AN -- AT 

3143
02:03:27,733 --> 02:03:34,240
ALMOST ANY COST. 

3144
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:35,441
HE STOOD AT THE OLYMPIC'S WHILE 

3145
02:03:35,441 --> 02:03:38,244
RUSSIAN ATHLETES WERE DOPING ON 

3146
02:03:38,244 --> 02:03:39,078
A MASSIVE SCALE. 

3147
02:03:39,078 --> 02:03:46,785
HE RESPECTS STRENGTH BOTH 

3148
02:03:46,785 --> 02:03:47,453
POLITICAL AND MILITARY. 

3149
02:03:47,453 --> 02:03:48,888
HE HAS A BLACK BELT IN JUDO. 

3150
02:03:48,888 --> 02:03:50,455
OPPONENTS SAY HE IS NIMBLE AND 

3151
02:03:50,455 --> 02:03:51,891
RUTHLESS. 

3152
02:03:51,891 --> 02:03:53,492
A FORMER CIA OFFICER STATIONED 

3153
02:03:53,492 --> 02:03:54,527
IN MOSCOW: 

3154
02:03:54,527 --> 02:04:00,199
>> HE WILL LOOK FOR SUBTLE 

3155
02:04:00,199 --> 02:04:00,900
SIGNALS AND VULNERABILITIES 

3156
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:02,101
THAT HE COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 

3157
02:04:02,101 --> 02:04:02,634
IN THE MEETING. 

3158
02:04:02,634 --> 02:04:03,736
A ONE-ON-ONE MEETING IS THE 

3159
02:04:03,736 --> 02:04:04,470
BEST OPPORTUNITY TO DO 

3160
02:04:04,470 --> 02:04:05,104
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 

3161
02:04:05,104 --> 02:04:06,772
>> Reporter: HE ONCE SAID THAT 

3162
02:04:06,772 --> 02:04:15,614
THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET 

3163
02:04:15,614 --> 02:04:16,549
UNION WAS THE GREATEST 

3164
02:04:16,549 --> 02:04:17,283
CATASTROPHE OF THE 20th 

3165
02:04:17,283 --> 02:04:17,550
CENTURY. 

3166
02:04:17,550 --> 02:04:18,684
EVERYTHING HE SAYS AND DOES IS 

3167
02:04:18,684 --> 02:04:19,485
ABOUT REVERSING THE COLLAPSE, 

3168
02:04:19,485 --> 02:04:21,020
IN SHORT, MAKING RUSSIA GREAT 

3169
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:24,356
AGAIN. 

3170
02:04:24,356 --> 02:04:25,224
THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING 

3171
02:04:25,224 --> 02:04:26,458
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO BE 

3172
02:04:26,458 --> 02:04:30,162
ABLE TO IDENTIFY WITH. 

3173
02:04:30,162 --> 02:04:31,330
>> AS THEY HAVE THAT MEETING 

3174
02:04:31,330 --> 02:04:31,697
RIGHT NOW. 

3175
02:04:31,697 --> 02:04:33,198
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A CLOSER 

3176
02:04:33,198 --> 02:04:33,999
LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP 

3177
02:04:33,999 --> 02:04:38,971
BETWEEN THESE TWO PRESIDENTS. 

3178
02:04:38,971 --> 02:04:40,940
>> AT THE START OF THE SUMMIT, 

3179
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:43,542
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD THE PLAN 

3180
02:04:43,542 --> 02:04:44,476
REPORTED THAT THE WORLD WANTS 

3181
02:04:44,476 --> 02:04:49,114
TO SEE US GET ALONG. 

3182
02:04:49,114 --> 02:04:49,949
WE HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT 

3183
02:04:49,949 --> 02:04:51,349

UP. 

3202
02:08:22,261 --> 02:08:23,695
THE LEAD UP A BEING THAT THE 

3203
02:08:23,695 --> 02:08:24,763
PRESIDENT WAS WITH THE NATO 

3204
02:08:24,763 --> 02:08:25,030
LEADERS. 

3205
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:27,266
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT 

3206
02:08:27,266 --> 02:08:29,134
MEETING? 

3207
02:08:29,134 --> 02:08:30,402
>> THE EMERGENCY SESSION WHERE 

3208
02:08:30,402 --> 02:08:34,840
THEY ASKED THE GEORGIAN AND 

3209
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:35,640
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTS TO LEAVE 

3210
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:36,909
IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR 

3211
02:08:36,909 --> 02:08:37,242
PRESENTATION. 

3212
02:08:37,242 --> 02:08:39,912
APPARENTLY, PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS 

3213
02:08:39,912 --> 02:08:41,446
SAYING OKAY, WE'RE DONE WITH 

3214
02:08:41,446 --> 02:08:45,017
YOU NOW. 

3215
02:08:45,017 --> 02:08:46,185
THE BIG THING WAS HE WASN'T 

3216
02:08:46,185 --> 02:08:47,085
GETTING COMMITMENTS FROM OTHER 

3217
02:08:47,085 --> 02:08:47,820
LEADERS TO SPEND MORE. 

3218
02:08:47,820 --> 02:08:49,621
MANY OF THEM SAID WE HAVE TO 

3219
02:08:49,621 --> 02:08:50,288
ASK OUR PARLIAMENTS. 

3220
02:08:50,288 --> 02:08:51,690
WE CAN JUST TELL YOU WE WILL 

3221
02:08:51,690 --> 02:08:52,123
SPEND MORE. 

3222
02:08:52,123 --> 02:08:53,926
TRMP TURNS AROUND TO THE 

3223
02:08:53,926 --> 02:08:58,197
TURKISH PRESIDENT AND SAYS, 

3224
02:08:58,197 --> 02:09:03,202
EXCEPT FOR HIM OVER HERE, HE 

3225
02:09:03,202 --> 02:09:04,336
DOES THINGS THE RIGHT WAY AND 

3226
02:09:04,336 --> 02:09:05,737
HE FIST BUMPS THE TURKISH 

3227
02:09:05,737 --> 02:09:06,538
PRESIDENT. 

3228
02:09:06,538 --> 02:09:08,307
IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT 

3229
02:09:08,307 --> 02:09:12,311
EXTENT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE 

3230
02:09:12,311 --> 02:09:17,749
WITH HIM, THIS IS VERY VISIBLE. 

3231
02:09:17,749 --> 02:09:18,683
IT'S A VERY VISIBLE SUGGESTION. 

3232
02:09:18,683 --> 02:09:24,456
>> WHY WOULD THE AMERICAN DOSE 

3233
02:09:24,456 --> 02:09:25,691
WHY WOULD THEY BE NERVOUS TO 

3234
02:09:25,691 --> 02:09:27,092
HAVE THE MARKET PRESIDENT 

3235
02:09:27,092 --> 02:09:37,169
TALKING TO THE TURKEY PRESIDENT?

3236
02:09:37,169 --> 02:09:38,237
TURKEY IS HARDLY A LIBERAL 

3237
02:09:38,237 --> 02:09:38,537
DEMOCRACY. 

3238
02:09:38,537 --> 02:09:39,271
ANOTHER THING THAT WAS 

3239
02:09:39,271 --> 02:09:40,005
INTERESTING IS THAT APPARENTLY 

3240
02:09:40,005 --> 02:09:41,073
THE DUTCH PRIME MINISTER WAS 

3241
02:09:41,073 --> 02:09:42,274
THE LAST PERSON TO INTERVENE AT 

3242
02:09:42,274 --> 02:09:50,983
THE SUMMIT BEFORE TRUMP HAD HIS 

3243
02:09:50,983 --> 02:09:51,450
PRESS CONFERENCE. 

3244
02:09:51,450 --> 02:09:52,584
HE BASICALLY SAID LOOK, YOU ARE 

3245
02:09:52,584 --> 02:09:53,452
REALLY FRUSTRATED, WHY DON'T 

3246
02:09:53,452 --> 02:09:55,053
YOU JUST TAKE A VICTORY LAP. 

3247
02:09:55,053 --> 02:09:57,689
SAY THAT THE ALLIES HAVE BEEN 

3248
02:09:57,689 --> 02:09:59,324
SPENDING $33 BILLION MORE SINCE 

3249
02:09:59,324 --> 02:10:04,229
YOU BECAME PRESIDENT, TAKE A 

3250
02:10:04,229 --> 02:10:04,830
CREDIT FOR IT. 

3251
02:10:04,830 --> 02:10:06,098
THAT WAS THE LAST THING TRUMP 

3252
02:10:06,098 --> 02:10:07,099
HEARD BEFORE HE LEFT THE 

3253
02:10:07,099 --> 02:10:08,333
MEETING, AND IT WAS THE FIRST 

3254
02:10:08,333 --> 02:10:08,901
THING HE SAID. 

3255
02:10:08,901 --> 02:10:10,736
>> IT WOULD MAKE A FIST BUMP 

3256
02:10:10,736 --> 02:10:11,937
REALLY DISTURBING FOR PEOPLE TO 

3257
02:10:11,937 --> 02:10:12,137
SEE. 

3258
02:10:12,137 --> 02:10:16,241
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE COMMENTS

3259
02:10:16,241 --> 02:10:17,675
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT 

3260
02:10:17,675 --> 02:10:21,446
PUTIN MADE? 

3261
02:10:21,446 --> 02:10:23,315
>> INTERESTING THAT TRUMP 

3262
02:10:23,315 --> 02:10:26,985
SPECIFICALLY TALKED ABOUT CHINA 

3263
02:10:26,985 --> 02:10:28,686
A FAIR BIT MORE THAN ANYTHING 

3264
02:10:28,686 --> 02:10:29,554
ELSE. 

3265
02:10:29,554 --> 02:10:32,257
>> HE DID NOT MENTION RUSSIAN 

3266
02:10:32,257 --> 02:10:33,425
MEDDLING. 

3267
02:10:33,425 --> 02:10:42,901
>> HE SAID HE WOULD BRING IT 

3268
02:10:42,901 --> 02:10:43,101
UP. 

3269
02:10:43,101 --> 02:10:44,803
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT DO 

3270
02:10:44,803 --> 02:10:48,473
BELIEVE THAT LONG TERM, THE 

3271
02:10:48,473 --> 02:10:49,541
UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA SHOULD 

3272
02:10:49,541 --> 02:10:50,375
HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. 

3273
02:10:50,375 --> 02:11:02,087
CHINA IS THE PROBLEM. 

3274
02:11:02,087 --> 02:11:02,888
CHINA IS THE EMERGING 

3275
02:11:02,888 --> 02:11:03,188
SUPERPOWER. 

3276
02:11:03,188 --> 02:11:04,189
CHINA IS ACTUALLY THE TRUE 

3277
02:11:04,189 --> 02:11:04,689
COMPETITOR UNDERMINING 

3278
02:11:04,689 --> 02:11:05,390
AMERICANS AND UNDERMINING THE 

3279
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:05,857
RUSSIANS LONG-TERM. 

3280
02:11:05,857 --> 02:11:06,758
I THINK THAT WAS STEVE 

3281
02:11:06,758 --> 02:11:07,993
O'BANNON'S VIEW WHEN HE WAS THE 

3282
02:11:07,993 --> 02:11:09,027
CHIEF STRATEGIST FOR THE WHITE 

3283
02:11:09,027 --> 02:11:09,260
HOUSE. 

3284
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:10,429
I THINK IT IS INTERESTING THAT 

3285
02:11:10,429 --> 02:11:11,229
TRUMP IS CLEARLY TURNING 

3286
02:11:11,229 --> 02:11:12,164

THE ON HELPFULNESS IN THE NORTH 

3289

KOREAN PERSPECTIVE, I THINK THAT

3290
02:11:19,271 --> 02:11:19,771
SET THE. 

3291
02:11:19,771 --> 02:11:20,973
THE OTHER THING IS 

3292
02:11:20,973 --> 02:11:21,373
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

3293
02:11:21,373 --> 02:11:23,008
>> WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT RIGHT 

3294
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:26,445

SIDES OF THE AISLE SAY THEY 

3419
02:21:47,298 --> 02:21:48,499
HOPE THE PRESIDENT WILL BRING 

3420
02:21:48,499 --> 02:21:50,101
UP RUSSIA MEDDLING IN THE 2016 

3421
02:21:50,101 --> 02:21:55,540
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. 

3422
02:21:55,540 --> 02:21:56,540
YOU CAN HEAR OTHER CURRENT 

3423
02:21:56,540 --> 02:21:57,174
DIPLOMATS AND INTELLIGENCE 

3424
02:21:57,174 --> 02:21:58,176
OFFICIALS SAYING THAT ONLY WHAT 

3425
02:21:58,176 --> 02:21:59,677
RUSSIA HAS DONE IN THE PAST, 

3426
02:21:59,677 --> 02:22:00,578
BUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING RIGHT 

3427
02:22:00,578 --> 02:22:01,812
THIS DAY IN TERMS OF ATTACKING 

3428
02:22:01,812 --> 02:22:02,280
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. 

3429
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:03,481
THIS COMES JUST DAYS AFTER THE 

3430
02:22:03,481 --> 02:22:09,053
INDICTMENT OF 12 RUSSIAN AGENTS.

3431
02:22:09,053 --> 02:22:10,421
THEY ARE FACING A NUMBER OF 

3432
02:22:10,421 --> 02:22:11,022
ELECTION RELATED CHARGES 

3433
02:22:11,022 --> 02:22:20,331
INCLUDING CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT 

3434
02:22:20,331 --> 02:22:21,165
COMPUTER CRIMES AND IDENTITY 

3435
02:22:21,165 --> 02:22:21,398
THEFT. 

3436
02:22:21,398 --> 02:22:22,567
IT SHOULD NOT GO UNNOTICED WITH 

3437
02:22:22,567 --> 02:22:23,401
THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 

3438
02:22:23,401 --> 02:22:24,201
INTELLIGENCE SAYING JUST BEFORE 

3439
02:22:24,201 --> 02:22:25,236
THE SUMMIT STARTED, THE THREAT 

3440
02:22:25,236 --> 02:22:28,172
OF A CYBER ATTACK IS STILL 

3441
02:22:28,172 --> 02:22:33,544
WIDESPREAD. 

3442
02:22:33,544 --> 02:22:35,113
SOME U.S. OFFICIALS WHO ARE 

3443
02:22:35,113 --> 02:22:38,616
WORRIED ABOUT POTENTIAL 

3444
02:22:38,616 --> 02:22:39,384
CONCESSIONS, THE PRESIDENT MAY 

3445
02:22:39,384 --> 02:22:40,451
MAKE THEM IN THE PRIVATE 

3446
02:22:40,451 --> 02:22:40,718
MEETING. 

3447
02:22:40,718 --> 02:22:45,690
>> GOOD MORNING. 

3448
02:22:45,690 --> 02:22:46,791
AS YOU SAID, IT IS 

3449
02:22:46,791 --> 02:22:47,625
UNPRECEDENTED FOR AN AMERICAN 

3450
02:22:47,625 --> 02:22:49,193
PRESIDENT TO HAVE THIS MUCH 

3451
02:22:49,193 --> 02:22:51,628
TIME ALONE WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. 

3452
02:22:51,628 --> 02:22:52,629
IT IS NOT UNPRECEDENTED FOR 

3453
02:22:52,629 --> 02:22:53,698
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S APPROACH TO 

3454
02:22:53,698 --> 02:22:53,998
DIPLOMACY. 

3455
02:22:53,998 --> 02:22:57,167
REMEMBER EARLY ON, HE MET ONE-

3456
02:22:57,167 --> 02:23:00,505
ON-ONE WITH THE CHINESE 

3457
02:23:00,505 --> 02:23:01,339
PRESIDENT. 

3458
02:23:01,339 --> 02:23:10,715
HE PREFERS ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS 

3459
02:23:10,715 --> 02:23:11,749
BECAUSE HE HAS THIS BOTTOMLESS 

3460
02:23:11,749 --> 02:23:12,483
SELF-CONFIDENCE ABOUT TAKING A 

3461
02:23:12,483 --> 02:23:13,751
WORLD LEADER IN THE SPACE WHERE 

3462
02:23:13,751 --> 02:23:14,986
THERE'S JUST TWO OF THEM AND 

3463
02:23:14,986 --> 02:23:15,753
NEGOTIATING ON THEIR BEHALF. 

3464
02:23:15,753 --> 02:23:19,223
WITHOUT ANY OTHER INTERFERENCE. 

3465
02:23:19,223 --> 02:23:21,059
IT GRATES AN OPPORTUNITY BUT IT 

3466
02:23:21,059 --> 02:23:26,431
CREATES RISKS. 

3467
02:23:26,431 --> 02:23:27,398
IN BRUSSELS, I ENCOUNTERED MANY 

3468
02:23:27,398 --> 02:23:28,199
NATO MINISTERS WHO WERE 

3469
02:23:28,199 --> 02:23:29,033
SOMEWHAT ANXIOUS ABOUT THE 

3470
02:23:29,033 --> 02:23:29,834
PROSPECT OF RUSSIAN RESIDENT 

3471
02:23:29,834 --> 02:23:33,671
VLADIMIR PUTIN TALKING 

3472
02:23:33,671 --> 02:23:34,706
PRESIDENT TRUMP INTO MAYBE AN 

3473
02:23:34,706 --> 02:23:35,506
OFFICIAL OR UNOFFICIAL SEMI 

3474
02:23:35,506 --> 02:23:36,274
RECOGNITION OF RUSSIA'S 

3475
02:23:36,274 --> 02:23:40,578
ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA. MAYBE 

3476
02:23:40,578 --> 02:23:41,345
CANCELING JOINT NATO EXERCISES 

3477
02:23:41,345 --> 02:23:43,014
AND DOING THINGS FROM A NATO 

3478
02:23:43,014 --> 02:23:46,017
PERSPECTIVE WOULD WEAKEN THE 

3479
02:23:46,017 --> 02:23:58,896
ALLIANCE AND STRENGTHEN RUSSIA. 

3480
02:23:58,896 --> 02:24:00,331
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT MAY COME 

3481
02:24:00,331 --> 02:24:01,532
OUT OF THE PRIVATE MEETING OR 

3482
02:24:01,532 --> 02:24:02,967
IF WE WILL GET A CLEAR READ 

3483
02:24:02,967 --> 02:24:03,934
FROM EITHER OF THOSE PRESIDENTS 

3484
02:24:03,934 --> 02:24:04,969
ABOUT JUST EXACTLY WHAT THEY 

3485
02:24:04,969 --> 02:24:05,269
DISCUSSED. 

3486
02:24:05,269 --> 02:24:10,875
THERE WILL BE A WORKING LUNCH. 

3487
02:24:10,875 --> 02:24:12,310
THEN A PRESS CONFERENCE FROM 

3488
02:24:12,310 --> 02:24:15,546
BOTH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESENT

3489
02:24:15,546 --> 02:24:16,480
WHERE WHITE HOUSE ADVISORS 

3490
02:24:16,480 --> 02:24:26,123
ASSURED ME AGAIN JUST THIS 

3491
02:24:26,123 --> 02:24:27,125
MORNING THAT THEY WILL TAKE 

3492
02:24:27,125 --> 02:24:27,892
QUESTIONS FROM THE PRESS. 

3493
02:24:27,892 --> 02:24:28,993
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED IN MORE 

3494
02:24:28,993 --> 02:24:29,727
THAN A DECADE. 

3495
02:24:29,727 --> 02:24:30,795
IT WILL BE EXTRAORDINARY TO SEE 

3496
02:24:30,795 --> 02:24:31,996
THOSE TWO LEADERS ON THE STAGE 

3497
02:24:31,996 --> 02:24:32,429
TAKING QUESTIONS. 

3498
02:24:32,429 --> 02:24:33,631
FOR MORE ON WHAT TO EXPECT, 

3499
02:24:33,631 --> 02:24:35,066
LET'S GO BACK TO JOHN IN NEWARK 

3500
02:24:35,066 --> 02:24:39,070
-- NEW YORK. 

3501
02:24:39,070 --> 02:24:49,847
>> MARGARET BRENNAN IS HERE, 

3502
02:24:49,847 --> 02:24:51,048
WILLIAM BURNS IS WITH US AS 

3503
02:24:51,048 --> 02:24:51,281
WELL. 

3504
02:24:51,281 --> 02:24:52,250
HE SERVED AS AMBASSADOR TO 

3505
02:24:52,250 --> 02:24:53,284
RUSSIA FROM 2005 THROUGH 2008 

3506
02:24:53,284 --> 02:24:54,584
AND MET PRESIDENT VLADIMIR 

3507
02:24:54,584 --> 02:24:56,320
PUTIN. 

3508
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:57,555
YOU SAID THAT THE BEST THING 

3509
02:24:57,555 --> 02:24:58,523
THAT CAN HAPPEN FROM THIS 

3510
02:24:58,523 --> 02:24:59,791
MEETING IS THAT IT WOULD BE 

3511
02:24:59,791 --> 02:25:01,559
HIPPOCRATIC WHICH IS TO SAY THE 

3512
02:25:01,559 --> 02:25:11,402
HIPPOCRATIC OATH, DO NO HARM. 

3513
02:25:11,402 --> 02:25:12,637
>> FIRST MEANS IT IS ESSENTIAL 

3514
02:25:12,637 --> 02:25:13,571
THAT THE PRESIDENT MAKE CLEAR 

3515
02:25:13,571 --> 02:25:14,605
TO PRESIDENT PUTIN THAT THE 

3516
02:25:14,605 --> 02:25:15,406
ELECTION MEDDLING WHICH WAS 

3517
02:25:15,406 --> 02:25:17,041
DOCUMENTED LAST WEEK IS A MAJOR 

3518
02:25:17,041 --> 02:25:18,476
ASSAULT ON OUR DEMOCRACY. 

3519
02:25:18,476 --> 02:25:19,443
IT IS VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS. 

3520
02:25:19,443 --> 02:25:20,878
I THINK IT MEANS NOT SUCCUMBING 

3521
02:25:20,878 --> 02:25:21,712
TO THE ILLUSION THAT PERSONAL 

3522
02:25:21,712 --> 02:25:22,346
RAPPORT CAN TRANSFORM 

3523
02:25:22,346 --> 02:25:24,515
RELATIONSHIPS OR THAT THEY ARE 

3524
02:25:24,515 --> 02:25:25,550
HAVING GRAND BARGAINS TO BE 

3525
02:25:25,550 --> 02:25:25,817
MADE. 

3526
02:25:25,817 --> 02:25:27,385
AND I THINK YOU CAN FOCUS ON A 

3527
02:25:27,385 --> 02:25:28,386
FEW PRACTICAL STEPS ESPECIALLY 

3528
02:25:28,386 --> 02:25:29,820
IN ARMS-CONTROL WITH THE NEW 

3529
02:25:29,820 --> 02:25:35,560
START PROCEDURE EXPIRES IN A 

3530
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:35,927
COUPLE YEARS. 

3531
02:25:35,927 --> 02:25:36,994
THAT IS A CONVERSATION WE 

3532
02:25:36,994 --> 02:25:41,199
SHOULD RESUME WITH THE RUSSIANS.

3533
02:25:41,199 --> 02:25:42,300
>> THE PERSONAL RAPPORT POINT 

3534
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:43,301
COME IS THAT SOMETHING EVERY 

3535
02:25:43,301 --> 02:25:44,702
PRESIDENT NEEDS TO LEARN? 

3536
02:25:44,702 --> 02:25:48,940
GEORGE W. BUSH, THEY SAID WE 

3537
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:50,808
ARE GOING TO FALL FOR A COZY 

3538
02:25:50,808 --> 02:25:52,777
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RUSSIAN 

3539
02:25:52,777 --> 02:25:53,678
LEADER, THERE ARE INTEREST 

3540
02:25:53,678 --> 02:26:03,754
SEPARATE AND APART. 

3541
02:26:03,754 --> 02:26:04,421
>> PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS 

3542
02:26:04,421 --> 02:26:05,623
MATTER, BUT THEY HAVE TO BE 

3543
02:26:05,623 --> 02:26:06,891
TETHERED TO HISTORY FOR A SENSE 

3544
02:26:06,891 --> 02:26:08,226
OF WHAT IT IS YOU WANT TO 

3545
02:26:08,226 --> 02:26:08,526
ACCOMPLISH. 

3546
02:26:08,526 --> 02:26:09,527
THIS IS ABOUT JUST GETTING 

3547
02:26:09,527 --> 02:26:10,528
ALONG WITH ANOTHER LEADER, IT'S 

3548
02:26:10,528 --> 02:26:11,529
ABOUT PURSUING AMERICAN IS JUST 

3549
02:26:11,529 --> 02:26:12,630
-- AMERICAN INTERESTS. 

3550
02:26:12,630 --> 02:26:21,839
>> IS IT A FAIR CRITICISM? 

3551
02:26:21,839 --> 02:26:23,241
>> IN THE TWEET THE PRESENCE OF 

3552
02:26:23,241 --> 02:26:24,442
THIS MORNING, HE SAID NOT ONLY 

3553
02:26:24,442 --> 02:26:25,542
OUR RELATIONS AT THE LOW-END, 

3554
02:26:25,542 --> 02:26:27,078
BUT IT IS BASICALLY HIS 

3555
02:26:27,078 --> 02:26:29,981
PREDECESSOR'S FAULT. THAT ISN'T 

3556
02:26:29,981 --> 02:26:33,317
NECESSARILY TETHERED TO HISTORY.

3557
02:26:33,317 --> 02:26:37,455
THE INTERVENTION IN SYRIA AND 

3558
02:26:37,455 --> 02:26:38,890
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS 

3559
02:26:38,890 --> 02:26:41,192
IN 2016. 

3560
02:26:41,192 --> 02:26:50,568
>> IN OPENING COMMENTS, 

3561
02:26:50,568 --> 02:26:51,535
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE WILL 

3562
02:26:51,535 --> 02:26:53,070
ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS, AREN'T 

3563
02:26:53,070 --> 02:26:53,971
WE PAST THE POINT OF ASKING 

3564
02:26:53,971 --> 02:26:54,271
QUESTIONS? 

3565
02:26:54,271 --> 02:26:55,139
THAT HAPPENED AT THE LAST 

3566
02:26:55,139 --> 02:26:55,406
MEETING. 

3567
02:26:55,406 --> 02:26:56,440
DON'T WE NEED ANSWERS RIGHT 

3568
02:26:56,440 --> 02:26:56,640
NOW? 

3569
02:26:56,640 --> 02:27:02,947
>> AS THE PRESIDENT SAID, WHAT 

3570
02:27:02,947 --> 02:27:03,481
DO YOU EXPECT? 

3571
02:27:03,481 --> 02:27:04,282
A PERRY MASON MOMENT? 

3572
02:27:04,282 --> 02:27:05,549
HE SEEMS TO BE DISMISSING THIS 

3573
02:27:05,549 --> 02:27:08,352
IDEA THAT A CONFRONTATION IS 

3574
02:27:08,352 --> 02:27:09,386
NEEDED EVEN THOUGH HE PRIDES 

3575
02:27:09,386 --> 02:27:10,721
HIMSELF ON TOUGH TALK. 

3576
02:27:10,721 --> 02:27:12,456
THE QUESTION, I THINK IS, HE 

3577
02:27:12,456 --> 02:27:14,692
WANTS TO TURN THE PAGE AND PUT 

3578
02:27:14,692 --> 02:27:20,965
THE TRUMP BRAND ON IN TERMS OF 

3579
02:27:20,965 --> 02:27:22,099
A NEW DEAL WHETHER IT'S ARMS-

3580
02:27:22,099 --> 02:27:23,000
CONTROL OR SOME TYPE OF 

3581
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:24,068
BREAKTHROUGH IN SYRIA OR THE 

3582
02:27:24,068 --> 02:27:24,335
UKRAINE. 

3583
02:27:24,335 --> 02:27:25,869
THE CONCERN LEADING UP TO THIS 

3584
02:27:25,869 --> 02:27:27,271
IS, LET'S JUST HAVE OUR FINGERS 

3585
02:27:27,271 --> 02:27:29,707
CROSSED THAT NATO IS GOOD 

3586
02:27:29,707 --> 02:27:31,309
ENOUGH AND HE DOESN'T GIVE 

3587
02:27:31,309 --> 02:27:35,947
PUTIN ANYTHING. 

3588
02:27:35,947 --> 02:27:37,048
THEY ARE CONCERNED HE COULD 

3589
02:27:37,048 --> 02:27:38,049
CALL OF MILITARY EXERCISES IN 

3590
02:27:38,049 --> 02:27:39,216
THE BALTIC, LIKE WHAT HE DID 

3591
02:27:39,216 --> 02:27:40,518
WHEN HE MET WITH THE NORTH 

3592
02:27:40,518 --> 02:27:41,285
KOREAN LEADER, CALL SOMETHING 

3593
02:27:41,285 --> 02:27:42,286
OFF WITHOUT GETTING ANYTHING IN 

3594
02:27:42,286 --> 02:27:42,519
RETURN. 

3595
02:27:42,519 --> 02:27:44,087
COULD HE DO SOMETHING LIKE IT 

3596
02:27:44,087 --> 02:27:46,490
RECOGNIZE THE ANNEXATION OF 

3597
02:27:46,490 --> 02:27:51,796

IN A VERY LOOSELY PREPARED 

3623
02:28:40,811 --> 02:28:42,013

02:49:16,579 --> 02:49:19,616
[ LAUGHTER ] I WAS DOING 

3959
02:49:19,616 --> 02:49:24,721
FUNDRAISING, I WAS ACTUALLY 

3960
02:49:24,721 --> 02:49:25,722
RAISING MONEY FOR THE LA 

3961
02:49:25,722 --> 02:49:27,957
MISSION FROM THE BAY AREA 

3962
02:49:27,957 --> 02:49:29,058
CALLING TO ORANGE COUNTY WHICH 

3963
02:49:29,058 --> 02:49:30,493
IS A VERY CONSERVATIVE AREA. 

3964
02:49:30,493 --> 02:49:31,261
I WOULD SAY HI. 

3965
02:49:31,261 --> 02:49:35,331
HOW ARE YOU DOING. WE'RE JUST 

3966
02:49:35,331 --> 02:49:36,298
TAKING A SURVEY AND MAKING 

3967
02:49:36,298 --> 02:49:38,301
SURE, DID YOU SUFFER ANY OF THE 

3968
02:49:38,301 --> 02:49:41,137
BREAK-INS TODAY? 

3969
02:49:41,137 --> 02:49:42,205
SOAK YOUR CAR IS OKAY? 

3970
02:49:42,205 --> 02:49:43,006
BECAUSE ACTUALLY I'M CALLING 

3971
02:49:43,006 --> 02:49:44,040
FROM THE LOS ANGELES MISSION, 

3972
02:49:44,040 --> 02:49:45,675
AND WE HAVE A NEW PLAN TO STOP 

3973
02:49:45,675 --> 02:49:47,076
ALL OF THAT. 

3974
02:49:47,076 --> 02:49:48,645
WHAT WE ARE DOING IS WE WANT TO 

3975
02:49:48,645 --> 02:49:51,147
GET ALL OF THE POOR PEOPLE, WE 

3976
02:49:51,147 --> 02:49:52,382
WANT TO TAKE ALL OF THE 

3977
02:49:52,382 --> 02:49:53,182
HOMELESS PEOPLE FROM YOUR 

3978
02:49:53,182 --> 02:49:54,183
NEIGHBORHOOD AND MOVE THEM TO 

3979
02:49:54,183 --> 02:49:54,884
DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES. 

3980
02:49:54,884 --> 02:49:57,987
WE NEED HELP, BECAUSE WE ARE 

3981
02:49:57,987 --> 02:49:59,254

3982
02:49:59,254 --> 02:50:04,160
THEM AND GIVE THEM JOBS. 

3983
02:50:04,160 --> 02:50:05,628
I FELT OKAY ABOUT IT BECAUSE I 

3984
02:50:05,628 --> 02:50:06,629
WAS RAISING MONEY FOR A 

3985
02:50:06,629 --> 02:50:07,597
HOMELESS MISSION, BUT I ALSO 

3986
02:50:07,597 --> 02:50:09,666
FELT TERRIBLE ABOUT IT. 

3987
02:50:09,666 --> 02:50:11,034
>> I WILL ASK THIS QUESTION IN 

3988
02:50:11,034 --> 02:50:13,303
MY WHITE VOICE. 

3989
02:50:13,303 --> 02:50:19,142
[ LAUGHTER ] YOU TALK ABOUT 

3990
02:50:19,142 --> 02:50:19,976
NURSING THIS GRIEVANCE, BUT 

3991
02:50:19,976 --> 02:50:21,177
THIS SCRIPT TOOK A LITTLE WHILE 

3992
02:50:21,177 --> 02:50:24,247
TO GET TO THE GATEKEEPERS, TALK 

3993
02:50:24,247 --> 02:50:24,714
ABOUT THAT. 

3994
02:50:24,714 --> 02:50:25,882
>> I FINISHED WRITING IT IN 

3995
02:50:25,882 --> 02:50:26,082
2012. 

3996
02:50:26,082 --> 02:50:27,317
WE PUBLISHED IT AS ITS OWN 

3997
02:50:27,317 --> 02:50:30,553
PAPERBACK BOOK IN 2014. THEN I 

3998
02:50:30,553 --> 02:50:37,460
WENT TO THE SUNDANCE LABS IN 

3999
02:50:37,460 --> 02:50:38,461
2015 AND SUNDANCE DIRECTORS LAB 

4000
02:50:38,461 --> 02:50:38,861
IN 2016. 

4001
02:50:38,861 --> 02:50:39,962
WE SHOT IT LAST YEAR. 

4002
02:50:39,962 --> 02:50:46,836
IT HAS BEEN SIX OR 7 YEARS OF, 

4003
02:50:46,836 --> 02:50:48,004
WE ARE GOING TO START SHOOTING 

4004
02:50:48,004 --> 02:50:48,771
AT THREE MONTHS NOW. 

4005
02:50:48,771 --> 02:50:50,073
>> DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT 

4006
02:50:50,073 --> 02:50:50,473
GIVING UP? 

4007
02:50:50,473 --> 02:50:50,907
>> NO. 

4008
02:50:50,907 --> 02:50:52,442
I BASICALLY PAINTED MYSELF INTO 

4009
02:50:52,442 --> 02:50:56,913
A CORNER. 

4010
02:50:56,913 --> 02:50:58,414
I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO MAKE 

4011
02:50:58,414 --> 02:50:59,782
GOOD ON THE LIE THAT I WAS 

4012
02:50:59,782 --> 02:51:00,983
TELLING WHICH WAS THAT WE WERE 

4013
02:51:00,983 --> 02:51:01,984
GOING TO SHOOT A MOVIE. 

4014
02:51:01,984 --> 02:51:03,419
>> IT'S AN ABSURD DARK COMEDY 

4015
02:51:03,419 --> 02:51:04,287
WITH AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE. 

4016
02:51:04,287 --> 02:51:07,090
>> I THINK THERE IS AN OPTIMISM 

4017
02:51:07,090 --> 02:51:08,191
THAT COMES THROUGH THE MOVIE 

4018
02:51:08,191 --> 02:51:09,992
THAT EVEN THOUGH THE WORLD IS 

4019
02:51:09,992 --> 02:51:12,762
MESSED UP, THERE IS A WAY TO 

4020
02:51:12,762 --> 02:51:14,097
CHANGE IT. 

4021
02:51:14,097 --> 02:51:18,935
THERE IS AN ANALYSIS THAT SHOWS 

4022
02:51:18,935 --> 02:51:20,103
THAT THE PEOPLE CAN DO THINGS 

4023
02:51:20,103 --> 02:51:25,141
LIKE WITHHOLD THEIR LABOR AND 

4024
02:51:25,141 --> 02:51:25,974
TAKE HOLD OF THINGS. 

4025
02:51:25,974 --> 02:51:27,176
THERE IS AN OPTIMISM THAT COMES 

4026
02:51:27,176 --> 02:51:28,044
FROM THAT. 

4027
02:51:28,044 --> 02:51:34,083
>> AND SHOCKING TWISTS AND 

4028
02:51:34,083 --> 02:51:35,318
TURNS IN THE MOVIE, THAT'S ALL 

4029
02:51:35,318 --> 02:51:35,952
I WILL SAY. 

4030
02:51:35,952 --> 02:51:37,353
YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY. 

4031
02:51:37,353 --> 02:51:38,588
YOU WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE THE 

4032
02:51:38,588 --> 02:51:38,821
SPIRIT. 

4033
02:51:38,821 --> 02:51:40,256
>> THIS IS A MOVIE THAT YOU 

4034
02:51:40,256 --> 02:51:42,024
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GUESS 

4035
02:51:42,024 --> 02:51:43,893
WHAT'S HAPPENING. 

4036
02:51:43,893 --> 02:51:45,328
HE DIDN'T GIVE UP, AND IT IS 

4037
02:51:45,328 --> 02:51:46,295
PAYING OFF. 

4038
02:51:46,295 --> 02:51:51,667
>>> SARTRE -- SORRY TO BOTHER 

4039
02:51:51,667 --> 02:51:55,037
YOU IS IN THEATERS. 

4040
02:51:55,037 --> 02:52:01,744
>>> AND WE HAVE LIFE LESSONS 

4041
02:52:01,744 --> 02:52:02,145
COMING UP. 

4042
02:52:02,145 --> 02:52:03,012
>>> ORIGINAL REPORTING EVERY

HERE IS MY VIDEO JOURNAL. 

4047
02:55:16,539 --> 02:55:21,010
I REMEMBER SEEING MY DAD WHEN 

4048
02:55:21,010 --> 02:55:23,012
WE SAID GOODBYE TO HIM, HE 

4049
02:55:23,012 --> 02:55:25,715
STARTED CRYING, BUT HE TURNED 

4050
02:55:25,715 --> 02:55:28,851
AWAY SO THAT WE COULDN'T SEE IT.

4051
02:55:28,851 --> 02:55:30,686
LEAVING YOUR HOMELAND FEELS LIKE

4052
02:55:30,686 --> 02:55:38,594
LEAVING PART OF YOUR SOUL. 

4053
02:55:38,594 --> 02:55:39,929
>> CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT IT WAS 

4054
02:55:39,929 --> 02:55:40,930
LIKE TO INTEGRATE INTO GERMAN 

4055
02:55:40,930 --> 02:55:41,197
SOCIETY? 

4056
02:55:41,197 --> 02:55:42,598
>> IT IS LIKE A WAVE, EITHER 

4057
02:55:42,598 --> 02:55:44,000
YOU WRITE IT OR YOU FIGHT IT. 

4058

>> MY DREAM IS TO BE A DOCTOR. 

4059
02:55:46,202 --> 02:55:47,870
I WANT TO STUDY AT HARVARD. 

4060
02:55:47,870 --> 02:55:49,672
I WANT TO GO BACK TO SYRIA AND

4062
02:55:52,475 --> 02:55:58,814
THAT IS MY DREAM. 

4063
02:55:58,814 --> 02:56:04,320
>>> HELLO EVERYONE. 

4064
02:56:04,320 --> 02:56:05,053

THEY ADDRESSED REPORTERS TODAY. 

4069
02:56:15,097 --> 02:56:16,098
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THE WORLD 

4070
02:56:16,098 --> 02:56:17,299
WANTS TO SEE THE U.S. AND 

4071
02:56:17,299 --> 02:56:19,735
RUSSIA GET ALONG. 

4072
02:56:19,735 --> 02:56:20,770
HE CALLED THE NATIONS THE 

4073
02:56:20,770 --> 02:56:21,370
WORLD'S GREATEST NUCLEAR 

4074
02:56:21,370 --> 02:56:21,603
POWERS. 

4075
02:56:21,603 --> 02:56:29,078
THE MEETING COMES JUST DAYS 

4076
02:56:29,078 --> 02:56:29,912
AFTER THE U.S. JUSTICE

02:56:29,912 --> 02:56:30,679
DEPARTMENT CHARGE 12 RUSSIAN 

4078
02:56:30,679 --> 02:56:31,313
INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS FOR 

4079
02:56:31,313 --> 02:56:32,114
HACKING INTO THE DEMOCRATIC 

4080
02:56:32,114 --> 02:56:32,948
NATIONAL COMMITTEE DURING THE 

4081
02:56:32,948 --> 02:56:33,382
2016 ELECTION. 

4082
02:56:33,382 --> 02:56:34,583
HERE IS SOME OF WHAT THE 

4083
02:56:34,583 --> 02:56:36,585
PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY EARLIER. 

4084
02:56:36,585 --> 02:56:38,187
>> WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS 

4085
02:56:38,187 --> 02:56:39,955
TO TALK ABOUT AND THINGS TO 

4086
02:56:39,955 --> 02:56:44,126
TALK ABOUT. 

4087
02:56:44,126 --> 02:56:45,061
WE HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON 

4088
02:56:45,061 --> 02:56:45,761
EVERYTHING FROM TRADE TO 

4089
02:56:45,761 --> 02:56:48,764
MILITARY AND MISSILES AND CHINA

4090
02:56:48,764 --> 02:56:50,232
. WE WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT 

4091
02:56:50,232 --> 02:56:50,599
ABOUT CHINA. 

4092
02:56:50,599 --> 02:56:52,668
OUR MUTUAL FRIEND. 

4093
02:56:52,668 --> 02:56:54,270
I THINK WE HAVE GREAT 

4094
02:56:54,270 --> 02:56:58,507
OPPORTUNITIES TOGETHER. WE 

4095
02:56:58,507 --> 02:57:00,041
FRANKLY HAVE NOT BEEN GETTING 

4096
02:57:00,041 --> 02:57:02,111
ALONG VERY WELL FOR THE PAST 

4097
02:57:02,111 --> 02:57:06,215
FEW YEARS. 

4098
02:57:06,215 --> 02:57:08,317
I THINK WE WILL END UP HAVING 

4099
02:57:08,317 --> 02:57:11,954
AN EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP. 

4100
02:57:11,954 --> 02:57:13,089
GETTING ALONG WITH RUSSIA IS A 

4101
02:57:13,089 --> 02:57:16,592
GOOD THING, NOT A BAD THING. 

4102
02:57:16,592 --> 02:57:17,860
I REALLY THINK THE WORLD WANTS 

4103
02:57:17,860 --> 02:57:19,862
TO SEE US GET ALONG. 

4104
02:57:19,862 --> 02:57:23,299
WE ARE THE TWO GREAT NUCLEAR 

4105
02:57:23,299 --> 02:57:23,532
POWERS. 

4106
02:57:23,532 --> 02:57:29,371
WE HAVE 90% OF THE NUCLEAR. 

4107
02:57:29,371 --> 02:57:30,572
THAT IS NOT A GOOD THING. 

4108
02:57:30,572 --> 02:57:31,440
THAT'S A BAD THING. 

4109
02:57:31,440 --> 02:57:32,608
I THINK WE HOPEFULLY COULD DO 

4110
02:57:32,608 --> 02:57:35,878
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. 

4111
02:57:35,878 --> 02:57:37,313
IT IS NOT A POSITIVE FORCE, IT 

4112
02:57:37,313 --> 02:57:38,114
IS A NEGATIVE FORCE. 

4113
02:57:38,114 --> 02:57:39,415
WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT 

4114
02:57:39,415 --> 02:57:41,350
AMONG OTHER THINGS. 

4115
02:57:41,350 --> 02:57:44,820
>> WE SPOKE TO IAN BREHMER 

4116
02:57:44,820 --> 02:57:46,522
ABOUT THE MEETING. 

4117
02:57:46,522 --> 02:57:48,858
>> HE HAS SET IT UP TO BE A 

4118
02:57:48,858 --> 02:57:50,359
GREAT MEETING. IT IS CLEARLY 

4119
02:57:50,359 --> 02:57:52,194
GOING TO BE THE WARMEST OF HIS 

4120
02:57:52,194 --> 02:57:53,829
TRIP. 

4121
02:57:53,829 --> 02:57:55,197
IT REMINDS ME OF THE FIRST TRIP 

4122
02:57:55,197 --> 02:57:57,666
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE WHERE THE 

4123
02:57:57,666 --> 02:58:02,338
BEST PART WAS SAUDI ARABIA. 

4124
02:58:02,338 --> 02:58:03,706
I SOON AS HE STARTS WORKING HIS 

4125
02:58:03,706 --> 02:58:05,173
WAY TOWARDS EUROPE, THINGS GET 

4126
02:58:05,173 --> 02:58:06,976
WORSE. 

4127
02:58:06,976 --> 02:58:07,977
IT HAS BECOME AN ENHANCED 

4128
02:58:07,977 --> 02:58:11,046
VERSION OF THAT. 

4129
02:58:11,046 --> 02:58:11,881
EUROPEAN ALLIES ARE BESIDE 

4130
02:58:11,881 --> 02:58:15,484
THEMSELVES WITH DISCONTENT. 

4131
02:58:15,484 --> 02:58:16,752
PUTIN IS RELAXED, COOL AS A 

4132
02:58:16,752 --> 02:58:17,019
CUCUMBER. 

4133
02:58:17,019 --> 02:58:17,352
SITTING BACK. 

4134
02:58:17,352 --> 02:58:21,857
LETTING TRUMP DO THE LIFTING. 

4135
02:58:21,857 --> 02:58:23,292
I THINK IT WILL BE THE SAME 

4136
02:58:23,292 --> 02:58:24,493
THING WHEN THEY DO THE PRESS 

4137
02:58:24,493 --> 02:58:24,993
CONFERENCE AFTERWARDS. 

4138
02:58:24,993 --> 02:58:26,095
I THINK TRUMP WILL BE TALKING 

4139
02:58:26,095 --> 02:58:30,933
AN AWFUL LOT AND PUTIN WILL BE 

4140
02:58:30,933 --> 02:58:34,236
HAPPY TO LET HIM. 

4141
02:58:34,236 --> 02:58:35,204
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE 

4142
02:58:35,204 --> 02:58:36,739
INDICTMENTS IN THE U.S., 12 

4143
02:58:36,739 --> 02:58:37,807
INDICTMENTS AGAINST ACTUAL 

4144
02:58:37,807 --> 02:58:40,876
RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE AGENTS FOR 

4145
02:58:40,876 --> 02:58:43,646
HACKING IN THE U.S. ELECTION. 

4146
02:58:43,646 --> 02:58:48,017
WE HAVE TRUMP'S OWN CYBER CZAR 

4147
02:58:48,017 --> 02:58:49,451
SAYING THAT WE ARE HEADING 

4148
02:58:49,451 --> 02:58:56,392
TOWARDS A NEW COLD WAR. 

4149
02:58:56,392 --> 02:59:03,499
ALL IN ALL, I DON'T EXPECT IT 

4150
02:59:03,499 --> 02:59:04,700
IN A 90 MINUTES OF ONE-ON-ONE, 

4151
02:59:04,700 --> 02:59:05,767
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION 

4152
02:59:05,767 --> 02:59:06,569
ON IT PERSONALLY ANYWAY. 

4153
02:59:06,569 --> 02:59:07,937
>> IF HE DOESN'T BRING UP THIS 

4154
02:59:07,937 --> 02:59:09,104
SORT OF STUFF, IS IT BASICALL 

4155
02:59:09,104 --> 02:59:10,306
SAYING GO HAD, WE HAVE ANOTHER 

4156
02:59:10,306 --> 02:59:11,774
ELECTION COMING UP, DO YOUR 

4157
02:59:11,774 --> 02:59:12,608
BEST? 

4158
02:59:12,608 --> 02:59:14,009
>> IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE EVEN 

4159
02:59:14,009 --> 02:59:19,081
WHAT HE MIGHT SAY FORMALLY. I 

4160
02:59:19,081 --> 02:59:20,115
CAN IMAGINE THEM SAYING OKAY, 

4161
02:59:20,115 --> 02:59:21,517
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS 

4162
02:59:21,517 --> 02:59:22,685
QUESTION, BUT WE BOTH KNOW THAT 

4163
02:59:22,685 --> 02:59:28,223
TRUMP IS PERSONALLY, AT LEAST 

4164
02:59:28,223 --> 02:59:29,825
NOT IN DIFFERENT ABOUT THE FACT 

4165
02:59:29,825 --> 02:59:30,692
THAT TO THE EXTENT THE RUSSIANS 

4166
02:59:30,692 --> 02:59:31,527
WERE INVOLVED, THEY WEREN'T 

4167
02:59:31,527 --> 02:59:31,894
HURTING HIM. 

4168
02:59:31,894 --> 02:59:34,763
THEY WEREN'T HURTING THE 

4169
02:59:34,763 --> 02:59:35,564
REPUBLICANS, THEY WERE HURTING 

4170
02:59:35,564 --> 02:59:35,931
THE DEMOCRATS. 

4171
02:59:35,931 --> 02:59:39,001
THEY WERE GOING AFTER HILLARY. 

4172
02:59:39,001 --> 02:59:40,201
TRUMP CERTAINLY CAN'T SAY 

4173
02:59:40,201 --> 02:59:43,873
PUBLICLY THAT HE IS HAPPY ABOUT 

4174
02:59:43,873 --> 02:59:45,274
IT, BUT I THINK WE ALL KNOW 

4175
02:59:45,274 --> 02:59:46,709
PRIVATELY HE IS HAPPY ABOUT 

4176
02:59:46,709 --> 02:59:48,077
THAT. 

4177
02:59:48,077 --> 02:59:49,812
AND IF RUSH IS GOING TO DO MORE 

4178
02:59:49,812 --> 02:59:53,115
OF THAT GOING FORWARD, IT IS 

4179
02:59:53,115 --> 02:59:54,383
NOT CLEAR THAT HE HAS A GREAT 

4180
02:59:54,383 --> 02:59:55,484
DEAL OF PERSONAL INTEREST IN 

4181
02:59:55,484 --> 02:59:55,851
STOPPING THEM. 

4182
02:59:55,851 --> 02:59:56,852
IT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN 

4183
02:59:56,852 --> 02:59:58,087
OTHERS IN A CHUMP 

4184
02:59:58,087 --> 03:00:06,395
ADMINISTRATION. 

4185
03:00:06,395 --> 03:00:09,765
-- TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 

4186
03:00:09,765 --> 03:00:11,133
>> GIVEN THE NEWS THAT CAME OUT 

4187
03:00:11,133 --> 03:00:12,501
OF THE NATO MEETINGS, AND THE 

4188
03:00:12,501 --> 03:00:15,771
IDEA THAT FOR SOME BRITONS, HE 

4189
03:00:15,771 --> 03:00:17,706
MAY HAVE DERAILED THERESA MAY'S 

4190
03:00:17,706 --> 03:00:18,006
GOVERNMENT. 

4191
03:00:18,006 --> 03:00:20,843
THE GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAID

4192
03:00:20,843 --> 03:00:23,245
THAT EUROPE CAN NO LONGER RELY 

4193
03:00:23,245 --> 03:00:29,018
ON THE WHITE HOUSE. 

4194
03:00:29,018 --> 03:00:30,019
THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW FOR 

4195
03:00:30,019 --> 03:00:31,020
VLADIMIR PUTIN, THERE ARE NO 

4196
03:00:31,020 --> 03:00:31,820
EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE HE COMES 

4197
03:00:31,820 --> 03:00:33,022
IN WITH SEVERAL WINS IN HIS 

4198
03:00:33,022 --> 03:00:38,961
TICK MARK BOX. 

4199
03:00:38,961 --> 03:00:40,195
JUST TALK TO US ABOUT THE 

4200
03:00:40,195 --> 03:00:41,163
RAMIFICATIONS OF THE TRIP, THE 

4201
03:00:41,163 --> 03:00:42,398
NATO SUMMIT, THE MEETING WITH 

4202
03:00:42,398 --> 03:00:43,766
THERESA MAY IN THE UK, AND HOW 

4203
03:00:43,766 --> 03:00:45,267
IT WILL ALL PLAY OUT IN THE 

4204
03:00:45,267 --> 03:00:46,201
MONTHS AHEAD. 

4205
03:00:46,201 --> 03:00:48,437
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP CANNOT STAND 

4206
03:00:48,437 --> 03:00:50,072
THE EUROPEAN UNION. 

4207
03:00:50,072 --> 03:00:54,977
>> HE CALLED IT A FOE. 

4208
03:00:54,977 --> 03:00:56,512
>> IT WAS THE FIRST FOE HE 

4209
03:00:56,512 --> 03:01:01,417
MENTIONED WITH  JEFF GLOR . IT 

4210
03:01:01,417 --> 03:01:02,351
IS A MULTILATERAL INSTITUTION. 

4211
03:01:02,351 --> 03:01:04,119
THE UNITED STATES IS NOT A PART 

4212
03:01:04,119 --> 03:01:04,520
OF IT. 

4213
03:01:04,520 --> 03:01:06,755
IT IS ALLIED WITH AMERICANS. 

4214
03:01:06,755 --> 03:01:09,024
BUT FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE ON 

4215
03:01:09,024 --> 03:01:13,261
DEFENSE, ON TRADE, ON VALUES, 

4216
03:01:13,261 --> 03:01:14,296
THESE ARE ALL ISSUES WHERE 

4217
03:01:14,296 --> 03:01:16,465
TRUMP WOULD RATHER SEE THE EU 

4218
03:01:16,465 --> 03:01:17,299
GO AWAY. 

4219
03:01:17,299 --> 03:01:21,804
HE DIRECTLY TOLD THE FRENCH 

4220
03:01:21,804 --> 03:01:22,972
PRESIDENT, YOU SHOULD LEAVE THE 

4221
03:01:22,972 --> 03:01:23,205
EU. 

4222
03:01:23,205 --> 03:01:25,407
I WILL GIVE YOU A BETTER 

4223
03:01:25,407 --> 03:01:29,945
BILATERAL TRADE DEAR -- TRADE 

4224
03:01:29,945 --> 03:01:34,750
DEAL THAN HE CAN HAVE OVER 

4225
03:01:34,750 --> 03:01:35,017
THERE. 

4226
03:01:35,017 --> 03:01:36,185
HE TOLD THERESA MAY, I THINK 

4227
03:01:36,185 --> 03:01:39,221
YOU SHOULD BE HANDLING BREXIT A 

4228
03:01:39,221 --> 03:01:39,621
LOT TOUGHER. 

4229
03:01:39,621 --> 03:01:41,090
MAKE A CLEAN BREAK, AND IF YOU 

4230
03:01:41,090 --> 03:01:44,526
DON'T DO THAT,  I AM OUT. 

4231
03:01:44,526 --> 03:01:45,828
THERE WILL NOT BE A BILATERAL 

4232
03:01:45,828 --> 03:01:46,761
U.S.-UK RELATIONSHIP. 

4233
03:01:46,761 --> 03:01:49,798
HE WENT MOST HARD AGAINST 

4234
03:01:49,798 --> 03:01:52,434
ANGELA MERKEL. 

4235
03:01:52,434 --> 03:01:53,736
HE WANTS TO RIP APART THE 

4236
03:01:53,736 --> 03:01:55,270
FABRIC OF THE EU. 

4237
03:01:55,270 --> 03:02:00,542
AND ON NATO, HE IS ACTUALLY 

4238
03:02:00,542 --> 03:02:02,177
PILING ON AN ALREADY VERY 

4239
03:02:02,177 --> 03:02:03,012
WEAKENED INSTITUTION THAT IT 

4240
03:02:03,012 --> 03:02:04,380
DOESN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT ITS 

4241
03:02:04,380 --> 03:02:04,813
PURPOSE IS. 

4242
03:02:04,813 --> 03:02:05,848
AT THESE TWO THINGS ARE 

4243
03:02:05,848 --> 03:02:09,718
OBVIOUSLY PRINCIPAL GOALS OF 

4244
03:02:09,718 --> 03:02:10,318
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR 

4245
03:02:10,318 --> 03:02:11,086
PUTIN. 

4246
03:02:11,086 --> 03:02:14,790
HE WANTS A WEAKER EUROPE. 

4247
03:02:14,790 --> 03:02:16,191
HE WANTS A DIVIDED 

4248
03:02:16,191 --> 03:02:18,427
TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP. 

4249
03:02:18,427 --> 03:02:20,029
THAT WAS ALL HAPPENING BEFORE 

4250
03:02:20,029 --> 03:02:25,267
PRESIDENT TRUMP. IT DOESN'T 

4251
03:02:25,267 --> 03:02:29,038
MATTER. 

4252
03:02:29,038 --> 03:02:29,838
HIS PRESIDENCY IS FACILITATING 

4253
03:02:29,838 --> 03:02:30,239
THAT. 

4254
03:02:30,239 --> 03:02:31,640
AND FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN'S 

4255
03:02:31,640 --> 03:02:33,175
PERSPECTIVE, YOU DON'T NEED TO 

4256
03:02:33,175 --> 03:02:35,244
SAY ANYTHING. 

4257
03:02:35,244 --> 03:02:36,345
>> WHAT ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL 

4258
03:02:36,345 --> 03:02:37,913
ARGUMENT THAT HEY, ALL OF A 

4259
03:02:37,913 --> 03:02:39,014
SUDDEN THESE NATO MEMBERS ARE 

4260
03:02:39,014 --> 03:02:40,783
PROMISING TO ANTE UP. 

4261
03:02:40,783 --> 03:02:42,017
CONGRESS IS MAINTAINING THE 

4262
03:02:42,017 --> 03:02:45,187
SANCTIONS THAT THE U.S. EXPELLED

4263
03:02:45,187 --> 03:02:48,523
A NUMBER OF DIPLOMATS IN LINE 

4264
03:02:48,523 --> 03:02:51,593
WITH OTHER ALLIES WHEN THERE 

4265
03:02:51,593 --> 03:02:57,266
WAS THE POISONING IN LONDON. 

4266
03:02:57,266 --> 03:02:58,867
ESSENTIALLY, THERE IS TALK, BUT 

4267
03:02:58,867 --> 03:03:00,502
THE ACTION, THE ACTIONS OF THE 

4268
03:03:00,502 --> 03:03:02,237
U.S. ADMINISTRATION ARE 

4269
03:03:02,237 --> 03:03:07,209
MAINTAINING A DISCIPLINED POINT 

4270
03:03:07,209 --> 03:03:23,859
OF VIEW ON RUSSIA. 

4271
03:03:23,859 --> 03:03:24,893
>> THE CHUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS 

4272
03:03:24,893 --> 03:03:25,928
BEEN TOUGHER OVERALL ON RUSSIA 

4273
03:03:25,928 --> 03:03:26,295
THAN OBAMA. 

4274
03:03:26,295 --> 03:03:27,563
THAT IS TRUE ON SANCTIONS AND 

4275
03:03:27,563 --> 03:03:28,130
KICKING OUT DIPLOMATS. 

4276
03:03:28,130 --> 03:03:29,364
THAT IS TRUE ON ARMING THE 

4277
03:03:29,364 --> 03:03:29,998
UKRAINIANS AGAINST RUSSIAN 

4278
03:03:29,998 --> 03:03:30,331
INTERVENTION. 

4279
03:03:30,331 --> 03:03:38,474
HAVING SAID THAT, TRUMP 

4280
03:03:38,474 --> 03:03:39,241
PERSONALLY HAS NOT BEEN 

4281
03:03:39,241 --> 03:03:40,309
INTERESTED IN PROMOTING ANY OF 

4282
03:03:40,309 --> 03:03:40,709
THOSE POLICIES. 

4283
03:03:40,709 --> 03:03:41,743
BEHIND THE SCENES, HE HAS 

4284
03:03:41,743 --> 03:03:42,744
PUSHED BACK PRETTY HARD AGAINST 

4285
03:03:42,744 --> 03:03:43,379
HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION. 

4286
03:03:43,379 --> 03:03:44,880
IT IS THE ONE PLACE IN THE 

4287
03:03:44,880 --> 03:03:45,848
ADMINISTRATION WHERE YOU SEE A 

4288
03:03:45,848 --> 03:03:46,815
VERY CLEAR AND DEFINABLE BREAK 

4289
03:03:46,815 --> 03:03:47,583
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

4290
03:03:47,583 --> 03:03:48,216
LITERALLY EVERYBODY ELSE. 

4291
03:03:48,216 --> 03:03:48,817
IT IS STRANGE. 

4292
03:03:48,817 --> 03:03:50,886
ON NATO, DID ACTUALLY ASK FOR 

4293
03:03:50,886 --> 03:03:51,687
MORE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE 

4294
03:03:51,687 --> 03:03:53,388
NATO ALLIES AND IF THEY WERE 

4295
03:03:53,388 --> 03:03:57,426
PRINTED -- IF THEY WERE 

4296
03:03:57,426 --> 03:04:03,232
PREPARED TO GIVE IT TO THEM, 

4297
03:04:03,232 --> 03:04:04,733
PUTIN WOULDN'T LIKE THAT. 

4298
03:04:04,733 --> 03:04:11,973
AND WHEN HE KICKED THE GEORGIAN 

4299
03:04:11,973 --> 03:04:13,041
AND UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTS OUT OF 

4300
03:04:13,041 --> 03:04:14,476
THE ROOM, HE SAID THAT WE ARE 

4301
03:04:14,476 --> 03:04:15,644
GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I'M 

4302
03:04:15,644 --> 03:04:16,478
GOING TO TALK ABOUT. 

4303
03:04:16,478 --> 03:04:17,880
THE LEADERS SAID WE CAN'T MAKE 

4304
03:04:17,880 --> 03:04:18,313
THIS HAPPEN. 

4305
03:04:18,313 --> 03:04:19,681
VISIT EVEN IF WE WANTED TO GIVE 

4306
03:04:19,681 --> 03:04:21,116
MORE MONEY, WE WOULD HAVE TO 

4307
03:04:21,116 --> 03:04:22,684
GET APPROVAL FROM OUR OWN 

4308
03:04:22,684 --> 03:04:23,986
HOMEGROWN PARLIAMENTS AT WHICH 

4309
03:04:23,986 --> 03:04:29,458
POINT TRUMP TURNS TO THE 

4310
03:04:29,458 --> 03:04:30,292
TURKISH PRESIDENT, NOT EXACTLY 

4311
03:04:30,292 --> 03:04:31,093
A PROPONENT OF LIBERAL 

4312
03:04:31,093 --> 03:04:31,393
DEMOCRACY. 

4313
03:04:31,393 --> 03:04:34,363
HE SAYS EXCEPT HE DOES THIS AT 

4314
03:04:34,363 --> 03:04:36,398
THE RIGHT WAY AND HE JUST BUMPS 

4315
03:04:36,398 --> 03:04:37,533
THE TURKISH PRESIDENT. 

4316
03:04:37,533 --> 03:04:43,071
I SWEAR. 

4317
03:04:43,071 --> 03:04:46,909
YOU ARE GIGGLY BECAUSE IT'S 

4318
03:04:46,909 --> 03:04:47,209
DISBELIEF. 

4319
03:04:47,209 --> 03:04:48,177
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'VE HEARD 

4320
03:04:48,177 --> 03:04:49,411
FROM THE ALLIED COUNTRIES 

4321
03:04:49,411 --> 03:04:50,979
SITTING AT THE ROOM AROUND THE 

4322
03:04:50,979 --> 03:04:51,380
TABLE. 

4323
03:04:51,380 --> 03:04:52,981
THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. 

4324
03:04:52,981 --> 03:04:54,849
AS MUCH AS THEY CONTINUE TO TRY 

4325
03:04:54,849 --> 03:04:58,453
TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE WAY 

4326
03:04:58,453 --> 03:04:59,721
TRUMP OPERATES, THEIR CAPACITY 

4327
03:04:59,721 --> 03:05:01,523
TO CONTINUE TO BE SURPRISED BY 

4328
03:05:01,523 --> 03:05:04,259
HIM IN THE FLESH, WHEN HE MAKES 

4329
03:05:04,259 --> 03:05:05,427
DETERMINATIONS LIKE THIS, THE 

4330
03:05:05,427 --> 03:05:09,932
FACT THAT HE, WHEN WE FIRST SAT 

4331
03:05:09,932 --> 03:05:10,899
DOWN AND TALKED ABOUT THE 

4332
03:05:10,899 --> 03:05:12,400
SECOND MEETING THAT VLADIMIR 

4333
03:05:12,400 --> 03:05:16,138
PUTIN AND TRUMP HAD AT THE G 20 

4334
03:05:16,138 --> 03:05:21,410
THAN HER. 

4335
03:05:21,410 --> 03:05:22,444
THE ALLIES WERE SO CONCERNED, 

4336
03:05:22,444 --> 03:05:23,712
BECAUSE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ALL 

4337
03:05:23,712 --> 03:05:28,517
OF THEM, HE HAD NO CONCERN 

4338
03:05:28,517 --> 03:05:29,418
ABOUT THE RADICALLY MORE 

4339
03:05:29,418 --> 03:05:31,853
FRIENDLY RELATIONSHIP WITH 

4340
03:05:31,853 --> 03:05:33,088
LATIMER PUTIN THAN HE DID WITH 

4341
03:05:33,088 --> 03:05:34,223
ANY AMERICAN ALLY. 

4342
03:05:34,223 --> 03:05:36,191
HE SHOWED THAT THE TURKISH 

4343
03:05:36,191 --> 03:05:40,395

4351
03:05:51,506 --> 03:05:52,507
WRONG WAY. 

4352
03:05:52,507 --> 03:05:54,742
THE TRUMP, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 

4353
03:05:54,742 --> 03:05:58,013

4357
03:06:05,087 --> 03:06:08,290
TOWARDS MORE AUTHORITARIAN RULE.

WHY HE CHOSE TO DO WHAT HE DID,

THIS NEW VIDEO? 

4431

4432
03:08:42,411 --> 03:08:43,011
THE TEMPERATURE CONSIDERABLY. 

4433
03:08:43,011 --> 03:08:43,779
JUST LOOKING AT THE 

4434
03:08:43,779 --> 03:08:44,546
DEMONSTRATIONS LAST NIGHT AS 

4435
03:08:44,546 --> 03:08:45,614
COMPARED TO THOSE ON SATURDAY

NIGHT, THE ONES LAST NIGHT 

4437
03:08:47,015 --> 03:08:50,685
INVOLVED A FEW DOZEN PEOPLE, 

4438
03:08:50,685 --> 03:08:51,653
AND THERE WERE NO MAJOR 

4439
03:08:51,653 --> 03:08:51,953
INCIDENCES. 

4440
03:08:51,953 --> 03:08:52,888
ON SATURDAY NIGHT, WHEN THE 

4441

SUSPECT HAD BEEN SHOT IN THE 

4443
03:08:57,826 --> 03:09:00,262
BACK AS HE FLED, THOSE RUMORS 

4444
03:09:00,262 --> 03:09:02,097
STOPED A LOT OF TENSIONS AND 

4445
03:09:02,097 --> 03:09:04,966
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNTS OF 

4446
03:09:04,966 --> 03:09:06,101
CONFRONTATION WITH THE POLICE. 

4447
03:09:06,101 --> 03:09:08,370
THE VIDEO, AS THE POLICE 

4448
03:09:08,370 --> 03:09:10,538
RELEASED IT SHOWS A DIFFERENT 

4449
03:09:10,538 --> 03:09:13,208
STORY. 

4450
03:09:13,208 --> 03:09:14,242
THAT DID LOWER THE TEMPERATURE 

4451
03:09:14,242 --> 03:09:24,386
ON THE STREET. 

4452
03:09:24,386 --> 03:09:25,454
>> WILL THEY RELEASE MORE 

4453
03:09:25,454 --> 03:09:25,687

TOOK PLACE. 

4461
03:09:36,598 --> 03:09:37,999
IT IS LIKELY THAT WE ARE GOING 

4462
03:09:37,999 --> 03:09:41,069
TO SEE DIFFERENT ANGLES OF THIS 

4463
03:09:41,069 --> 03:09:41,469
SAME INCIDENT. 

4464
03:09:41,469 --> 03:09:49,578
WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHEN. 

4465
03:09:49,578 --> 03:09:51,012
>> I WAS GOING TO SUCCUMB OFTEN 

4466
03:09:51,012 --> 03:09:52,013
WITH VIDEO, EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE 

4467
03:09:52,013 --> 03:09:53,281
ARE LOOKING AT THE IMAGES, THEY 

4468
03:09:53,281 --> 03:09:54,049
ARE STILL HAVING DEBATES. 

4469
03:09:54,049 --> 03:09:55,083
PEOPLE STILL WONDER IF WHAT 

4470
03:09:55,083 --> 03:09:56,084
THEY ARE SEEING IS ACTUALLY 

4471
03:09:56,084 --> 03:09:59,287
WHAT THE POLICE ARE SAYING. 

4472
03:09:59,287 --> 03:10:00,121
I'M WONDERING ABOUT THE 

4473
03:10:00,121 --> 03:10:00,956
ATTITUDE TOWARDS POLICE. 

4474
03:10:00,956 --> 03:10:03,892
WE COULD SEE THAT THE PROTESTS 

4475
03:10:03,892 --> 03:10:05,460
CONTINUED EVEN AFTER THE VIDEO 

4476
03:10:05,460 --> 03:10:06,094
WAS RELEASED. 

4477
03:10:06,094 --> 03:10:08,630
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

4478
03:10:08,630 --> 03:10:11,132
AND LISA SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON 

4479
03:10:11,132 --> 03:10:12,334
AS WELL AS THE POLICE IN 

4480
03:10:12,334 --> 03:10:13,801
GENERAL ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO 

4481
03:10:13,801 --> 03:10:18,206
THE EMOTIONS ON THE STREET NOW. 

4482
03:10:18,206 --> 03:10:19,674
THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF WHAT 

4483
03:10:19,674 --> 03:10:23,478
TOOK PLACE BACK IN 2014 WHEN 

4484
03:10:23,478 --> 03:10:24,813
LOOK JUAN McDONALD WAS SHOT 16 

4485
03:10:24,813 --> 03:10:29,017
TIMES BY A POLICEMAN AND THE 

4486
03:10:29,017 --> 03:10:30,185
VIDEO OF THAT INCIDENT WAS NOT 

4487
03:10:30,185 --> 03:10:33,088
RELEASED FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. 

4488
03:10:33,088 --> 03:10:34,055
JOHNSON SAID IT WAS INCUMBENT 

4489
03:10:34,055 --> 03:10:39,828
ON HIM TO TRY TO CALM THE 

4490
03:10:39,828 --> 03:10:40,128
SITUATION. 

4491
03:10:40,128 --> 03:10:41,630
THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WAS TO 

4492
03:10:41,630 --> 03:10:44,466
RELEASE THIS VIDEO. 

4493
03:10:44,466 --> 03:10:45,267
THERE WERE DEMONSTRATIONS LAST 

4494
03:10:45,267 --> 03:10:46,501
NIGHT, BUT IT WAS NOTHING LIKE 

4495
03:10:46,501 --> 03:10:47,869
WHAT HAPPENED ON SATURDAY NIGHT

4496
03:10:47,869 --> 03:10:50,906
. VERY LITTLE OF THE ANGER THAT 

4497
03:10:50,906 --> 03:10:52,173
WAS TAKING PLACE ON SATURDAY 

4498
03:10:52,173 --> 03:10:56,444
NIGHT CARRIED OVER INTO SUNDAY. 

4499
03:10:56,444 --> 03:10:57,945
>> WE EXPECT MORE PROTESTS 

4500
03:10:57,945 --> 03:10:59,648
TODAY? 

4501
03:10:59,648 --> 03:11:04,553
I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT THERE ARE. 

4502
03:11:04,553 --> 03:11:06,120
BUT IT'S VERY EARLY IN THE 

4503
03:11:06,120 --> 03:11:07,622
MORNING HERE IN CHICAGO. 

4504
03:11:07,622 --> 03:11:08,423
THERE MAY BE OTHER 

4505
03:11:08,423 --> 03:11:08,790
DEMONSTRATIONS. 

4506
03:11:08,790 --> 03:11:12,193
LIKE I SAID, THE RELEASE OF 

4507
03:11:12,193 --> 03:11:15,330
THAT VIDEO WAS TIMED TO LOWER 

4508
03:11:15,330 --> 03:11:17,332
THE TEMPERATURE ON THE STREET 

4509
03:11:17,332 --> 03:11:20,201
AND TO DISPEL MISINFORMATION 

4510
03:11:20,201 --> 03:11:23,138
THAT WAS OUT THERE. IT APPEARS 

4511
03:11:23,138 --> 03:11:24,806
TO HAVE DONE WHAT IT WAS 

4512
03:11:24,806 --> 03:11:29,678
SUPPOSED TO DO. 

4513
03:11:29,678 --> 03:11:35,850
>>> COMING UP, WHILE THE THAI 

4514
03:11:35,850 --> 03:11:36,618
SOCCER TEAM CONTINUES TO 

4515
03:11:36,618 --> 03:11:37,385
RECOVER, THEY'VE REUNITED WITH 

4516
03:11:37,385 --> 03:11:38,687
ONE OF THE RESCUERS THAT THEM 

4517
03:11:38,687 --> 03:11:43,391
SAFE INSIDE THE CAVE. 

4518
03:11:43,391 --> 03:11:44,559
>> AND A WOMAN WHO PLUNGED 

4519
03:11:44,559 --> 03:11:45,794
HUNDREDS OF FEET OVER A CLIFF 

4520
03:11:45,794 --> 03:11:46,628
IN CALIFORNIA TELLS HER 

4521
03:11:46,628 --> 03:11:50,031
INCREDIBLE STORY OF SURVIVAL. 

4522
03:11:50,031 --> 03:11:51,132
CBS NEWS, ALWAYS ON. 

4523
03:14:43,705 --> 03:14:44,972
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

4524
03:14:44,972 --> 03:14:47,342
PRESIDENT NEWTON OUR MEETING 

4525
03:14:47,342 --> 03:14:51,880
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IN 

4526
03:14:51,880 --> 03:14:52,313
HELSINKI, FINLAND. 

4527
03:14:52,313 --> 03:14:53,414
THEY ARE EXPECTED TO HOLD A 

4528
03:14:53,414 --> 03:14:54,749
JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE AFTER 

4529
03:14:54,749 --> 03:14:55,082
TALKS. 

4530
03:14:55,082 --> 03:14:59,187
WE ARE LIVE FROM HELSINKI. 

4531
03:14:59,187 --> 03:15:00,355
PUT THIS MEETING IN CONTEXT. 

4532
03:15:00,355 --> 03:15:06,027
WHAT IS AT STAKE? I THINK IT IS 

4533
03:15:06,027 --> 03:15:07,061
HARD TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY 

4534
03:15:07,061 --> 03:15:08,129
WHAT'S AT STAKE, BECAUSE WE 

4535
03:15:08,129 --> 03:15:09,531
DON'T KNOW WHAT IS ON THE 

4536
03:15:09,531 --> 03:15:09,764
AGENDA. 

4537
03:15:09,764 --> 03:15:13,935
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE

4538
03:15:13,935 --> 03:15:20,041
. FIRST THE ONE-ON-ONE MEETING 

4539
03:15:20,041 --> 03:15:20,842
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENTS, AND 

4540
03:15:20,842 --> 03:15:21,910
THEN THE EXTENDED MEETING WHERE 

4541
03:15:21,910 --> 03:15:24,112
LOTS OF IT ADVISORS WILL BE IN 

4542
03:15:24,112 --> 03:15:25,547
THE ROOM TO TRY TO HASH OUT 

4543
03:15:25,547 --> 03:15:27,181
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN SET IN 

4544
03:15:27,181 --> 03:15:29,651
MOTION. 

4545
03:15:29,651 --> 03:15:30,451
PRESIDENT TRUMP, FOR WHATEVER 

4546
03:15:30,451 --> 03:15:31,252
REASON HAS BEEN COMPLETELY 

4547
03:15:31,252 --> 03:15:32,253
VAGUE ABOUT HIS OWN INTENTIONS 

4548
03:15:32,253 --> 03:15:33,822
GOING IN TO THIS SUMMIT. 

4549
03:15:33,822 --> 03:15:36,357
WHAT ISSUES DOES HE CARE TO 

4550
03:15:36,357 --> 03:15:39,194
DRIVE WITH THE RUSSIAN 

4551
03:15:39,194 --> 03:15:39,494
PRESIDENT? 

4552
03:15:39,494 --> 03:15:40,394
WHAT INTERESTS OF THE UNITED 

4553
03:15:40,394 --> 03:15:42,497
STATES IS HE GOING TO BRING THE 

4554
03:15:42,497 --> 03:15:43,832
BEAR UP AGAINST A RUSSIAN 

4555
03:15:43,832 --> 03:15:46,301
LEADER, AND WHAT IS HE GOING TO 

4556
03:15:46,301 --> 03:15:47,368
EXTRACT IN TERMS OF CONCESSIONS 

4557
03:15:47,368 --> 03:15:48,703
FROM THE RUSSIANS? 

4558
03:15:48,703 --> 03:15:49,904
OR TO GET THEM SOMETHING TO 

4559
03:15:49,904 --> 03:15:51,539
LIVE UP TO AGREEMENTS THEY'VE 

4560
03:15:51,539 --> 03:15:52,373
ALREADY MADE WITH THIS 

4561
03:15:52,373 --> 03:15:54,342
PRESIDENT IN PLACES FOR EXAMPLE 

4562
03:15:54,342 --> 03:15:56,978
LIKE SYRIA? 

4563
03:15:56,978 --> 03:15:58,046
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 

4564
03:15:58,046 --> 03:15:59,013
PRESIDENT WANTS OUT OF THIS 

4565
03:15:59,013 --> 03:15:59,280
MEETING. 

4566
03:15:59,280 --> 03:16:06,788
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS UNTIL 

4567
03:16:06,788 --> 03:16:07,755
YESTERDAY WHEN HE DECLARED THIS 

4568
03:16:07,755 --> 03:16:09,257
A SUMMIT ON TWITTER, ALL OF HIS 

4569
03:16:09,257 --> 03:16:10,058
SENIOR ADVISORS PUBLICLY AND 

4570
03:16:10,058 --> 03:16:10,892
PRIVATELY WERE SAYING TO 

4571
03:16:10,892 --> 03:16:11,960
REPORTERS LIKE ME, DON'T CALL 

4572
03:16:11,960 --> 03:16:12,527
THIS A SUMMIT. 

4573
03:16:12,527 --> 03:16:13,294
IT IS A MEETING. 

4574
03:16:13,294 --> 03:16:14,762
A SUMMIT HAS TOO BIG OF AN 

4575
03:16:14,762 --> 03:16:16,097
AGENDA AND SETS EXPECTATIONS 

4576
03:16:16,097 --> 03:16:17,131
TOO HIGH. 

4577
03:16:17,131 --> 03:16:18,433
THEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLS IT A 

4578
03:16:18,433 --> 03:16:19,133
SUMMIT. 

4579
03:16:19,133 --> 03:16:24,706
THAT SUGGESTS A COUPLE OF 

4580
03:16:24,706 --> 03:16:24,939
THINGS. 

4581
03:16:24,939 --> 03:16:26,040
ONE IS A DECOUPLING FROM HIS 

4582
03:16:26,040 --> 03:16:27,075
ADVISORS ABOUT HOW TO SET 

4583
03:16:27,075 --> 03:16:28,409
EXPECTATIONS AND ALSO, IT 

4584
03:16:28,409 --> 03:16:30,311
SUGGESTS THAT EVEN WHEN THOSE 

4585
03:16:30,311 --> 03:16:31,412
CLOSEST TO THE PRESENT ARE 

4586
03:16:31,412 --> 03:16:38,953
TRYING TO HELP HIM BY 

4587
03:16:38,953 --> 03:16:39,954
MAINTAINING A LOW LEVEL OF 

4588
03:16:39,954 --> 03:16:40,521
EXPECTATIONS, THE PRESIDENT 

4589
03:16:40,521 --> 03:16:41,556
EITHER DOESN'T TAKE THE HELP 

4590
03:16:41,556 --> 03:16:42,724
SERIOUSLY OR DEFIES IT FOR HIS 

4591
03:16:42,724 --> 03:16:43,191
OWN REASON. 

4592
03:16:43,191 --> 03:16:44,792
I CAN TELL YOU, WHEN I WAS IN 

4593
03:16:44,792 --> 03:16:46,194
BRUSSELS TALKING TO MINISTERS 

4594
03:16:46,194 --> 03:16:51,566
OF NATO EACH AND EVERY MOMENT 

4595
03:16:51,566 --> 03:16:57,338
THAT HE SPENDS WITH PUTIN 

4596
03:16:57,338 --> 03:17:00,808
RAISES THE ANXIETY HERE BACK 

4597
03:17:00,808 --> 03:17:01,609
HOME, BECAUSE IN THIS 

4598
03:17:01,609 --> 03:17:04,879
STATECRAFT, PUTIN IS A MUCH 

4599
03:17:04,879 --> 03:17:05,479
MORE EXPERIENCED NEGOTIATOR. 

4600
03:17:05,479 --> 03:17:07,248
HE KNOWS WHAT HIS AGENDA IS 

4601
03:17:07,248 --> 03:17:09,918
ANTI-DRIVES HIS BARGAIN HIS 

4602
03:17:09,918 --> 03:17:10,151
WAY. 

4603
03:17:10,151 --> 03:17:11,686
CAPABLE OF A FLATTERING, NOT 

4604
03:17:11,686 --> 03:17:14,022
JUST AS PRESIDENT, BUT OTHER 

4605
03:17:14,022 --> 03:17:14,856
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND GETTING 

4606
03:17:14,856 --> 03:17:16,491
HIS WAY MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. 

4607
03:17:16,491 --> 03:17:19,327
SO THAT IS A CONSTRUCT THAT 

4608
03:17:19,327 --> 03:17:20,561
CREATES SOME DEGREE OF ANXIETY 

4609
03:17:20,561 --> 03:17:24,666
AMONG AMERICAN ALLIES. 

4610
03:17:24,666 --> 03:17:26,601
WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAPPEN IN 

4611
03:17:26,601 --> 03:17:29,604
THIS PRIVATE ENCOUNTER AND WHAT 

4612
03:17:29,604 --> 03:17:30,838
WILL VLADIMIR PUTIN SAY ON THE 

4613
03:17:30,838 --> 03:17:32,373
OTHER SIDE OF IT IN TERMS OF 

4614
03:17:32,373 --> 03:17:32,707
ISSUES? 

4615
03:17:32,707 --> 03:17:36,577
BY ENTERING WITH A VAGUE AGENDA

4616
03:17:36,577 --> 03:17:37,779
, IT CREATES AN OPENING, AT 

4617
03:17:37,779 --> 03:17:39,013
LEAST AN OPENING FOR VLADIMIR 

4618
03:17:39,013 --> 03:17:43,484
PUTIN TO GET MORE OF WHAT HE 

4619
03:17:43,484 --> 03:17:44,452
WANTS BECAUSE HE WILL HAVE 

4620
03:17:44,452 --> 03:17:46,120
DEFINED IT UPFRONT. 

4621
03:17:46,120 --> 03:17:47,322
>> WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE 

4622
03:17:47,322 --> 03:17:49,991
SAYING ABOUT THE VAGUE AGENDA 

4623
03:17:49,991 --> 03:17:51,392
ONE FOR A LOT OF AMERICANS IN 

4624
03:17:51,392 --> 03:17:53,294
CONGRESS, THERE COULD BE A 

4625
03:17:53,294 --> 03:17:54,062
COUPLE SPECIFIC THINGS THE 

4626
03:17:54,062 --> 03:17:55,696
PRESIDENT SAYS HE WANTS TO TALK 

4627
03:17:55,696 --> 03:17:56,931
ABOUT. 

4628
03:17:56,931 --> 03:17:58,299
HE COULD SAY HE WANTS TO TALK 

4629
03:17:58,299 --> 03:17:59,867
ABOUT THE POISONING OF UK 

4630
03:17:59,867 --> 03:18:05,206
CITIZENS ON THEIR SOIL. 

4631
03:18:05,206 --> 03:18:06,641
YOU COULD SAY HE WANTS TO TALK 

4632
03:18:06,641 --> 03:18:07,475
ABOUT THE 12 RUSSIAN 

4633
03:18:07,475 --> 03:18:08,075
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS THAT 

4634
03:18:08,075 --> 03:18:09,110
WERE JUST INDICTED BY THE 

4635
03:18:09,110 --> 03:18:09,643
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. 

4636
03:18:09,643 --> 03:18:11,312
BUT HE LEFT IT TO, WE WILL TALK 

4637
03:18:11,312 --> 03:18:12,947
ABOUT CHINA AND TALK ABOUT 

4638
03:18:12,947 --> 03:18:13,214
NUCLEAR. 

4639
03:18:13,214 --> 03:18:14,349
WE WANT TO HAVE A GOOD 

4640
03:18:14,349 --> 03:18:14,682
RELATIONSHIP. 

4641
03:18:14,682 --> 03:18:16,050
HOW IS THE WHITE HOUSE 

4642
03:18:16,050 --> 03:18:17,051
RESPONDING TO THAT LINE OF 

4643
03:18:17,051 --> 03:18:25,326
THINKING FROM OTHER AMERICANS? 

4644
03:18:25,326 --> 03:18:26,527
>> THAT THE PRESIDENT SETS THE 

4645
03:18:26,527 --> 03:18:26,828
AGENDA. 

4646
03:18:26,828 --> 03:18:28,162
HE IS THE DEALMAKER AND WHAT HE 

4647
03:18:28,162 --> 03:18:28,596
SAYS GOES. 

4648
03:18:28,596 --> 03:18:29,831
THAT IS GOING BACK TO THIS 

4649
03:18:29,831 --> 03:18:30,598
DECOUPLING I TALKED ABOUT. 

4650
03:18:30,598 --> 03:18:33,034
WILL WE DESCRIBE THIS AS A 

4651
03:18:33,034 --> 03:18:41,743
SUMMIT OR MEETING. 

4652
03:18:41,743 --> 03:18:43,044
A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKED OVERTIME 

4653
03:18:43,044 --> 03:18:44,212
TO SAY IT'S JUST A MEETING. 

4654
03:18:44,212 --> 03:18:45,446
AND THEN THE PRESIDENT CALLS IT 

4655
03:18:45,446 --> 03:18:45,813
A SUMMIT. 

4656
03:18:45,813 --> 03:18:47,048
THAT MEANS HE IS RUNNING THE 

4657
03:18:47,048 --> 03:18:47,248
SHOW. 

4658
03:18:47,248 --> 03:18:48,883
HE IS AT THE TOP AND HE DEFINES 

4659
03:18:48,883 --> 03:18:49,851
HIS OWN REALITY AND DEFINES 

4660
03:18:49,851 --> 03:18:50,918
WHATEVER THE CONTOURS OF WHAT 

4661
03:18:50,918 --> 03:18:52,120
HE WANTS TO NEGOTIATE IN THE 

4662
03:18:52,120 --> 03:18:52,987
MOMENT AT THAT TIME. 

4663
03:18:52,987 --> 03:18:54,155
THEN HE LEAVES IT TO HIS 

4664
03:18:54,155 --> 03:18:55,590
ADVISORS TO TRY TO SORT OUT AND 

4665
03:18:55,590 --> 03:18:56,958
COPE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES. 

4666
03:18:56,958 --> 03:19:02,530
LET'S REMIND US HOW THAT PLAYED 

4667
03:19:02,530 --> 03:19:03,097
OUT IN SINGAPORE. 

4668
03:19:03,097 --> 03:19:04,165
NO ONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION 

4669
03:19:04,165 --> 03:19:06,167
EXPECTED THE PRESIDENT TO GIVE 

4670
03:19:06,167 --> 03:19:07,201
UP A JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES 

4671
03:19:07,201 --> 03:19:08,569
WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN 

4672
03:19:08,569 --> 03:19:10,238
GOVERNMENT. 

4673
03:19:10,238 --> 03:19:12,040
YET HE DID. 

4674
03:19:12,040 --> 03:19:13,041
WHEN HE ANNOUNCED IT, IT 

4675
03:19:13,041 --> 03:19:14,075
SURPRISED THE SOUTH KOREANS AND 

4676
03:19:14,075 --> 03:19:15,042
THE PENTAGON AND OUR JAPANESE 

4677
03:19:15,042 --> 03:19:15,343
ALLIES. 

4678
03:19:15,343 --> 03:19:20,982
YET THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. 

4679
03:19:20,982 --> 03:19:22,450
HE MADE A DEAL IN THE MOMENT 

4680
03:19:22,450 --> 03:19:23,217
FACE-TO-FACE WITH KIM JONG-UN. 

4681
03:19:23,217 --> 03:19:24,819
AND EVERYONE ELSE HAD TO ADAPT 

4682
03:19:24,819 --> 03:19:25,286
AFTERWARDS. 

4683
03:19:25,286 --> 03:19:26,621
IN SO ANNOUNCING THE END OF THE 

4684
03:19:26,621 --> 03:19:28,089
JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES, 

4685
03:19:28,089 --> 03:19:29,123
PRESIDENT TRUMP USED THE VERY 

4686
03:19:29,123 --> 03:19:31,526
LANGUAGE THE NORTH KOREAN 

4687
03:19:31,526 --> 03:19:32,160
REGIME HAD USED. 

4688
03:19:32,160 --> 03:19:36,464
THEY WERE PROVOCATIVE. 

4689
03:19:36,464 --> 03:19:37,665
THAT IS AN EXAMPLE, A CLASSIC 

4690
03:19:37,665 --> 03:19:38,699
THERE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE 

4691
03:19:38,699 --> 03:19:39,867
EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN 

4692
03:19:39,867 --> 03:19:44,539
THESE ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS WHERE 

4693
03:19:44,539 --> 03:19:45,573
THE PRESIDENT WALKS IN AND 

4694
03:19:45,573 --> 03:19:46,574
THOSE AROUND THEM DON'T KNOW 

4695
03:19:46,574 --> 03:19:47,775
HIS AGENDA AND THEY DON'T KNOW 

4696
03:19:47,775 --> 03:19:48,810
WHAT HE WILL AGREE TO. 

4697
03:19:48,810 --> 03:19:50,044
HE AGREES TO IT AND TURNS 

4698
03:19:50,044 --> 03:19:50,978
AROUND TO EVERYONE ELSE AND 

4699
03:19:50,978 --> 03:19:51,846
SAYS MAKE IT WORK. 

4700
03:19:51,846 --> 03:19:53,514
THERE IS SOME ANTICIPATION HERE,

4701
03:19:53,514 --> 03:19:55,550
WHAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP GOING 

4702
03:19:55,550 --> 03:19:56,918
TO TURN AROUND AND SAY TO HIS 

4703
03:19:56,918 --> 03:20:00,354
ADVISORS AFTER THIS LENGTHY 

4704
03:20:00,354 --> 03:20:01,355
MEETING WITH PUTIN, THAT'S WHAT 

4705
03:20:01,355 --> 03:20:06,494
I AGREED TO, MAKE IT WORK. 

4706
03:20:06,494 --> 03:20:07,728
BUT WE SEE NO INDICATION THAT 

4707
03:20:07,728 --> 03:20:09,063
HE IS PASSIONATELY OR 

4708
03:20:09,063 --> 03:20:12,400
POETICALLY MOTIVATED TO DRIVE 

4709
03:20:12,400 --> 03:20:13,401
THIS RUSSIAN MEDDLING HARD TO 

4710
03:20:13,401 --> 03:20:15,670
PAST OR PRESENT. 

4711
03:20:15,670 --> 03:20:16,671
AND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN 

4712
03:20:16,671 --> 03:20:17,472
SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS ABOUT WHAT 

4713
03:20:17,472 --> 03:20:20,675
TO SAY ABOUT RUSSIAN INCURSION 

4714
03:20:20,675 --> 03:20:21,309
IN CRIMEA. 

4715
03:20:21,309 --> 03:20:28,015
THEY HAVEN'T SAID THEY 

4716
03:20:28,015 --> 03:20:28,816
RECOGNIZED IT OFFICIALLY BUT 

4717
03:20:28,816 --> 03:20:29,917
THEY HAVEN'T RULED IT OUT. 

4718
03:20:29,917 --> 03:20:31,052
THAT IS AN OPENING FOR THE 

4719
03:20:31,052 --> 03:20:31,319
RUSSIANS. 

4720
03:20:31,319 --> 03:20:32,419
I CAN TELL YOU IN BRUSSELS, 

4721
03:20:32,419 --> 03:20:33,921
ANOTHER BIG TOPIC, IT IS NOT A 

4722
03:20:33,921 --> 03:20:35,890
HUGE ISSUE, BUT ONE CENTRAL TO 

4723
03:20:35,890 --> 03:20:37,024
THE FUTURE OF THE NATO 

4724
03:20:37,024 --> 03:20:37,557
ALLIANCE, JOINT MILITARY 

4725
03:20:37,557 --> 03:20:38,425
EXERCISES IN THE BALTICS. 

4726
03:20:38,425 --> 03:20:39,826
VLADIMIR PUTIN WANTS THOSE TWO 

4727
03:20:39,826 --> 03:20:42,196
AND. 

4728
03:20:42,196 --> 03:20:52,773
-- WANTS THOSE TO END. 

4729
03:20:52,773 --> 03:20:54,008
>> WITH IDENTIFIED IN THE 12 

4730
03:20:54,008 --> 03:20:54,842
RUSSIAN OFFICERS WERE CHARGED 

4731
03:20:54,842 --> 03:20:56,010
WITH HACKING INTO THE DNC, I 

4732
03:20:56,010 --> 03:20:57,812
THINK MY QUESTION IS, THE 

4733
03:20:57,812 --> 03:20:58,880
PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT HE 

4734
03:20:58,880 --> 03:21:04,552
MIGHT RING IT UP. 

4735
03:21:04,552 --> 03:21:05,920
IT'S NOT REALLY ON THE TOP OF 

4736
03:21:05,920 --> 03:21:07,221
THE AGENDA, BUT WHAT CAN HE 

4737
03:21:07,221 --> 03:21:07,622
REALLY SAY? 

4738
03:21:07,622 --> 03:21:08,388
WHAT ARE HIS OPTIONS? 

4739
03:21:08,388 --> 03:21:09,223
PRESIDENT OBAMA FAMOUSLY TOLD 

4740
03:21:09,223 --> 03:21:11,492
VLADIMIR PUTIN TO CUT IT OUT 

4741
03:21:11,492 --> 03:21:13,294
AND IT DIDN'T MAKE MUCH OF A 

4742
03:21:13,294 --> 03:21:21,102
DIFFERENCE. 

4743
03:21:21,102 --> 03:21:22,270
>> WHEN IT COMES TO OPTIONS, 

4744
03:21:22,270 --> 03:21:23,504
YOU CAN USE THE VOICE OF 

4745
03:21:23,504 --> 03:21:24,472
AMERICA, THE PRESIDENCY OF THE 

4746
03:21:24,472 --> 03:21:25,473
UNITED STATES, AND AS THE 

4747
03:21:25,473 --> 03:21:26,274
ESSENTIALLY REPOSITORY AT THE 

4748
03:21:26,274 --> 03:21:27,742
TOP OF THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY 

4749
03:21:27,742 --> 03:21:32,813
TO SAY WE IN AMERICA CARE ABOUT 

4750
03:21:32,813 --> 03:21:33,780
DEMOCRACY AND WE WILL PROTECT 

4751
03:21:33,780 --> 03:21:34,582
IT. 

4752
03:21:34,582 --> 03:21:41,155
YOU INVITED -- YOU INVADED IT. 

4753
03:21:41,155 --> 03:21:41,956
THE FACTS ARE REAL. 

4754
03:21:41,956 --> 03:21:42,990
THIS HAPPENED AT THE HIGHEST 

4755
03:21:42,990 --> 03:21:46,627
LEVELS OF YOUR GOVERNMENT. 

4756
03:21:46,627 --> 03:21:47,895
WE KNOW IT, YOU SHOULD KNOW 

4757
03:21:47,895 --> 03:21:49,297
THAT WE KNOW IT, AND WE WILL 

4758
03:21:49,297 --> 03:21:50,498
TAKE EVERY SINGLE STEP WE CAN 

4759
03:21:50,498 --> 03:21:52,600
TO STOP IT IN THE FUTURE. 

4760
03:21:52,600 --> 03:21:53,167
THAT IS NOT A CONTROVERSIAL 

4761
03:21:53,167 --> 03:21:53,801
THING TO SAY. 

4762
03:21:53,801 --> 03:21:54,802
IT IS A DIRECT FORCEFUL 

4763
03:21:54,802 --> 03:21:56,137
RESPONSE TO A HOSTILE ACT BY A 

4764
03:21:56,137 --> 03:21:56,604
HOSTILE GOVERNMENT. 

4765
03:21:56,604 --> 03:21:58,339
MANY IN CONGRESS HAVE ASKED FOR 

4766
03:21:58,339 --> 03:22:00,741
THE PRESIDENT TO SAY PRECISELY 

4767
03:22:00,741 --> 03:22:01,642
THOSE WORDS AND SAY THEM IN 

4768
03:22:01,642 --> 03:22:06,747
PUBLIC AND REINFORCE THEM IN 

4769
03:22:06,747 --> 03:22:07,014
PRIVATE. 

4770
03:22:07,014 --> 03:22:08,149
ONE OF THE THINGS THE AMERICAN 

4771
03:22:08,149 --> 03:22:09,383
GOVERNMENT CAN DO WHICH IT IS 

4772
03:22:09,383 --> 03:22:10,585
SLOW TO HAVE DONE UNDER THE 

4773
03:22:10,585 --> 03:22:11,419
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS FORTIFY 

4774
03:22:11,419 --> 03:22:12,920
CYBER DEFENSES, GATHER ALL OF 

4775
03:22:12,920 --> 03:22:15,089
THE STATES VARIOUS ELECTION 

4776
03:22:15,089 --> 03:22:16,857
OFFICES AND SECRETARY OF STATE 

4777
03:22:16,857 --> 03:22:18,726
AND HELP THEM FORTIFY THEIR 

4778
03:22:18,726 --> 03:22:23,197
DEFENSES. 

4779
03:22:23,197 --> 03:22:24,432
MAKE IT A PROJECT TO MONITOR 

4780
03:22:24,432 --> 03:22:25,799
AND INTERCEPT AND CALL OUT 

4781
03:22:25,799 --> 03:22:29,737
PUBLICLY ANY FUTURE EFFORTS BY 

4782
03:22:29,737 --> 03:22:30,070
THE RUSSIANS. 

4783
03:22:30,070 --> 03:22:31,138
ALL OF THOSE ARE OPTIONS 

4784
03:22:31,138 --> 03:22:31,939
AVAILABLE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

4785
03:22:31,939 --> 03:22:32,907
MANY IN CONGRESS IN BOTH 

4786
03:22:32,907 --> 03:22:33,941
PARTIES ARE HOPEFUL HE WILL 

4787
03:22:33,941 --> 03:22:35,409
MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. 

4788
03:22:35,409 --> 03:22:40,881
>> I WANT TO POINT OUT HIS 

4789
03:22:40,881 --> 03:22:41,616
DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL AND 

4790
03:22:41,616 --> 03:22:42,917
FOCUS, WE CAN HEAR THAT THERE 

4791
03:22:42,917 --> 03:22:43,684
IS ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT VERY 

4792
03:22:43,684 --> 03:22:44,585
CLOSE TALKING VERY LOUD. 

4793
03:22:44,585 --> 03:22:47,321
YOU STATE FOCUS ON US. 

4794
03:22:47,321 --> 03:22:48,356
>> WE APPRECIATE THAT AS 

4795
03:22:48,356 --> 03:22:48,589
ALWAYS. 

4796
03:22:48,589 --> 03:22:49,991
AND WE SHOULD POINT OUT, WITH 

4797
03:22:49,991 --> 03:22:50,991
REGARDS TO HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP 

4798
03:22:50,991 --> 03:22:54,028
IS TREATING THIS MEETING AND 

4799
03:22:54,028 --> 03:22:55,463
TREATING THE RUSSIANS, HE 

4800
03:22:55,463 --> 03:22:58,766
TWEETED EARLIER, OUR 

4801
03:22:58,766 --> 03:22:59,567
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA HAS 

4802
03:22:59,567 --> 03:23:00,801
NEVER BEEN WORSE THANKS TO MANY 

4803
03:23:00,801 --> 03:23:01,769
YEARS OF U.S. FOOLISHNESS AND 

4804
03:23:01,769 --> 03:23:03,437
STUPIDITY, AND NOW THE RIGGED 

4805
03:23:03,437 --> 03:23:07,207
WITCHHUNT, THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN 

4806
03:23:07,207 --> 03:23:08,075
MINISTRY OF AFFAIRS, THROUGH 

4807
03:23:08,075 --> 03:23:08,676
THEIR TWITTER ACCOUNT 

4808
03:23:08,676 --> 03:23:16,784
RESPONDED, WE AGREE. 

4809
03:23:16,784 --> 03:23:18,219
>> IT IS REMARKABLE TO THINK OF 

4810
03:23:18,219 --> 03:23:18,486
THAT. 

4811
03:23:18,486 --> 03:23:20,421
THAT IS PART OF PRESIDENT 

4812
03:23:20,421 --> 03:23:23,891
TRUMP'S SENSE OF HIMSELF AND A 

4813
03:23:23,891 --> 03:23:28,962
SENSE OF HIS PRESIDENCY AS 

4814
03:23:28,962 --> 03:23:30,031
BEING SO DIFFERENT FROM ANY 

4815
03:23:30,031 --> 03:23:30,831
PRESIDENCY THAT CAME BEFORE. 

4816
03:23:30,831 --> 03:23:32,500
ON THIS AND SO MANY OTHER 

4817
03:23:32,500 --> 03:23:33,701
ISSUES. 

4818
03:23:33,701 --> 03:23:34,701
IT'S AS IF THE AMERICAN 

4819
03:23:34,701 --> 03:23:35,469
PRESIDENCY DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE 

4820
03:23:35,469 --> 03:23:36,871
HE ARRIVED THERE OR IF IT DID, 

4821
03:23:36,871 --> 03:23:38,706
IT WAS SO MISDIRECTED AND SO 

4822
03:23:38,706 --> 03:23:42,009
FOOLISH, SO STUPID THAT IT IS 

4823
03:23:42,009 --> 03:23:43,010
THE CAUSE OF ALL CURRENT 

4824
03:23:43,010 --> 03:23:44,245
PROBLEMS HE IS TRYING TO SORT 

4825
03:23:44,245 --> 03:23:44,478
OUT. 

4826
03:23:44,478 --> 03:23:45,246
NOTHING COULD PLEASE THE 

4827
03:23:45,246 --> 03:23:46,480
RUSSIANS MORE THAN TO HAVE THE 

4828
03:23:46,480 --> 03:23:49,850
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

4829
03:23:49,850 --> 03:23:51,152
AS HE WALKS INTO A PRIVATE 

4830
03:23:51,152 --> 03:23:52,653
MEETING WITH PUTIN ESSENTIALLY 

4831
03:23:52,653 --> 03:23:55,389
EMBRACE THEIR INTERPRETATION. 

4832
03:23:55,389 --> 03:23:56,223
IT IS NOT US. 

4833
03:23:56,223 --> 03:23:57,224
IT'S NOT US INVADING UKRAINE 

4834
03:23:57,224 --> 03:23:59,627
AND TAKING OVER CRIMEA. IT IS 

4835
03:23:59,627 --> 03:24:02,096
NOT AS RIGGING AGREEMENTS WE 

4836
03:24:02,096 --> 03:24:03,097
MADE WITH YOU IN SYRIA. 

4837
03:24:03,097 --> 03:24:08,035
IT IS NOT US MEDDLING IN YOUR 

4838
03:24:08,035 --> 03:24:08,835
ELECTIONS PAST AND POSSIBLY 

4839
03:24:08,835 --> 03:24:09,102
PRESENT. 

4840
03:24:09,102 --> 03:24:10,438
IT IS NOT US, AS YOU MENTIONED, 

4841
03:24:10,438 --> 03:24:14,041
POISONING A BRITISH CITIZEN IN 

4842
03:24:14,041 --> 03:24:16,344
BRITAIN. NONE OF THOSE THINGS 

4843
03:24:16,344 --> 03:24:17,545
HAVE HARMED THE U.S. 

4844
03:24:17,545 --> 03:24:20,581
RELATIONSHIP. IT'S THE PAST 

4845
03:24:20,581 --> 03:24:21,048
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS. 

4846
03:24:21,048 --> 03:24:22,149
FOR THAT, VLADIMIR PUTIN WOULD 

4847
03:24:22,149 --> 03:24:24,485
HAVE ALMOST WANT TO EXTEND A 

4848
03:24:24,485 --> 03:24:25,853
METAPHORICAL AND LITERAL 

4849
03:24:25,853 --> 03:24:27,321
BOUQUET OF THANKS. 

4850
03:24:27,321 --> 03:24:29,823
IT COULDN'T HAVE SET A BETTER 

4851
03:24:29,823 --> 03:24:36,263
PREDICATE FOR THE CONVERSATION. 

4852
03:24:36,263 --> 03:24:37,665
IT IS MORE THAN HALFWAY TO WHAT 

4853
03:24:37,665 --> 03:24:38,499
THE RUSSIANS ALREADY BELIEVE 

4854
03:24:38,499 --> 03:24:39,300
ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THE 

4855
03:24:39,300 --> 03:24:39,633
RELATIONSHIP. 

4856
03:24:39,633 --> 03:24:50,611
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

4857
03:24:50,611 --> 03:24:52,880
>>> BEFORE THE MEETING, HE 

4858
03:24:52,880 --> 03:24:56,517
SPOKE WITH JEFF GLOR  IN 

4859
03:24:56,517 --> 03:25:01,589
SCOTLAND. 

4860
03:25:01,589 --> 03:25:02,990
>> WHAT IS YOUR GOAL FROM THE 

4861
03:25:02,990 --> 03:25:03,290
MEETING? 

4862
03:25:03,290 --> 03:25:04,658
>> I WILL LET YOU KNOW AFTER 

4863
03:25:04,658 --> 03:25:05,092
THE MEETING. 

4864
03:25:05,092 --> 03:25:07,762
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY, IT WAS 

4865
03:25:07,762 --> 03:25:08,829
MUTUALLY AGREED, LET'S HAVE A 

4866
03:25:08,829 --> 03:25:09,096
MEETING. 

4867
03:25:09,096 --> 03:25:10,364
I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING TO 

4868
03:25:10,364 --> 03:25:10,631
ME. 

4869
03:25:10,631 --> 03:25:11,599
I DO BELIEVE IN MEETINGS. 

4870
03:25:11,599 --> 03:25:13,100
I BELIEVE THAT HAVING A MEETING 

4871
03:25:13,100 --> 03:25:14,201
WITH CHAIRMAN KIM WAS A GOOD 

4872
03:25:14,201 --> 03:25:14,434
THING. 

4873
03:25:14,434 --> 03:25:15,636
I THINK HAVING MEETINGS WITH 

4874
03:25:15,636 --> 03:25:18,272
THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA WAS A 

4875
03:25:18,272 --> 03:25:24,512
VERY GOOD THING. 

4876
03:25:24,512 --> 03:25:25,579
HAVING MEETINGS WITH RUSSIA AND 

4877
03:25:25,579 --> 03:25:27,114
CHINA AND NORTH KOREA, I 

4878
03:25:27,114 --> 03:25:33,087
BELIEVE IT. 

4879
03:25:33,087 --> 03:25:34,321
NOTHING BAD IS GOING TO COME 

4880
03:25:34,321 --> 03:25:34,922
OUT OF IT. 

4881
03:25:34,922 --> 03:25:36,123
AND MAYBE SOME GOOD WILL COME 

4882
03:25:36,123 --> 03:25:36,323
OUT. 

4883
03:25:36,323 --> 03:25:37,591
BUT I GO IN WITH LOW 

4884
03:25:37,591 --> 03:25:37,924
EXPECTATIONS. 

4885
03:25:37,924 --> 03:25:39,226
I'M NOT GOING WITH HIGH 

4886
03:25:39,226 --> 03:25:40,027
EXPECTATIONS. 

4887
03:25:40,027 --> 03:25:41,228
I DON'T REALLY, I CAN'T TELL 

4888
03:25:41,228 --> 03:25:42,496
YOU WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. 

4889
03:25:42,496 --> 03:25:44,064
BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT I WILL 

4890
03:25:44,064 --> 03:25:44,732
BE ASKING FOR. 

4891
03:25:44,732 --> 03:25:45,966
WE WILL SEE IF SOMETHING COMES 

4892
03:25:45,966 --> 03:25:46,300
OF IT. 

4893
03:25:46,300 --> 03:25:47,334
>> THE RUSSIANS INDICTED, WOULD 

4894
03:25:47,334 --> 03:25:57,478
YOU ASK HIM TO SEND THEM HERE? 

4895
03:25:57,478 --> 03:25:58,045
>> I MIGHT. 

4896
03:25:58,045 --> 03:25:59,079
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT. 

4897
03:25:59,079 --> 03:26:00,581
BUT I WILL BE ASKING ABOUT IT. 

4898
03:26:00,581 --> 03:26:01,682
BUT THIS WAS DURING THE OBAMA 

4899
03:26:01,682 --> 03:26:02,049
ADMINISTRATION. 

4900
03:26:02,049 --> 03:26:03,184
THEY WERE DOING WHATEVER IT WAS 

4901
03:26:03,184 --> 03:26:03,717
DURING THE OBAMA 

4902
03:26:03,717 --> 03:26:04,084
ADMINISTRATION. 

4903
03:26:04,084 --> 03:26:05,386
I HEARD THAT THEY WERE TRYING 

4904
03:26:05,386 --> 03:26:06,387
OR PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO HACK 

4905
03:26:06,387 --> 03:26:07,655
INTO THE RNC, THE REPUBLICAN 

4906
03:26:07,655 --> 03:26:08,656
NATIONAL COMMITTEE, BUT WE HAD 

4907
03:26:08,656 --> 03:26:13,594
MUCH BETTER DEFENSES. 

4908
03:26:13,594 --> 03:26:14,795
I THINK THE DNC SHOULD BE 

4909
03:26:14,795 --> 03:26:16,397
ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR 

4910
03:26:16,397 --> 03:26:17,998
ALLOWING THEMSELVES TO BE 

4911
03:26:17,998 --> 03:26:23,904
HACKED. 

4912
03:26:23,904 --> 03:26:25,139
THEY HAD A BAD DEFENSES, AND 

4913
03:26:25,139 --> 03:26:26,307
THEY WERE ABLE TO BE HACKED. 

4914
03:26:26,307 --> 03:26:27,474
I HEARD THAT THEY WERE TRYING 

4915
03:26:27,474 --> 03:26:28,509
TO HACK THE REPUBLICANS AS 

4916
03:26:28,509 --> 03:26:28,742
WELL. 

4917
03:26:28,742 --> 03:26:30,143
AND THIS MAY BE WRONG, BUT THEY 

4918
03:26:30,143 --> 03:26:31,412
HAD MUCH STRONGER DEFENSES. 

4919
03:26:31,412 --> 03:26:32,813
>> AND JEFF GLOR IS HERE WITH 

4920
03:26:32,813 --> 03:26:35,249
US NOW.  

4921
03:26:35,249 --> 03:26:36,784
THIS WAS SUCH A FASCINATING 

4922
03:26:36,784 --> 03:26:38,686
INTERVIEW. 

4923
03:26:38,686 --> 03:26:39,887
I KNOW YOU WILL INTERVIEW THE 

4924
03:26:39,887 --> 03:26:44,592
PRESIDENT AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY, 

4925
03:26:44,592 --> 03:26:45,626
YOUR MEET AND GREET MADE 

4926
03:26:45,626 --> 03:26:46,861
HEADLINES AROUND THE WORLD, 

4927
03:26:46,861 --> 03:26:47,862
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

4928
03:26:47,862 --> 03:26:54,401
UNITED STATES SUGGESTED THAT 

4929
03:26:54,401 --> 03:26:55,469
HIS OPPONENTS WERE THE EUROPEAN 

4930
03:26:55,469 --> 03:26:56,937
UNION AND HE CALLED RUSSIA A 

4931
03:26:56,937 --> 03:26:58,806
COMPETITOR. 

4932
03:26:58,806 --> 03:27:03,477
>> IT CAME UP WHILE WE WERE 

4933
03:27:03,477 --> 03:27:04,712
TALKING ABOUT NATO, I SAID WHO 

4934
03:27:04,712 --> 03:27:06,113
WAS YOUR BIGGEST COMPETITOR 

4935
03:27:06,113 --> 03:27:06,814
RIGHT NOW? 

4936
03:27:06,814 --> 03:27:08,782
THE FIRST THING HE SAID WAS THE 

4937
03:27:08,782 --> 03:27:09,950
EUROPEAN UNION. 

4938
03:27:09,950 --> 03:27:11,185
HE FOLLOWED THAT UP WITH CHINA 

4939
03:27:11,185 --> 03:27:12,620
AND RUSSIA AS WELL. 

4940
03:27:12,620 --> 03:27:14,054
AND I FOLLOWED UP, I SAID SOME 

4941
03:27:14,054 --> 03:27:15,222
PEOPLE MAY BE SURPRISED TO HEAR 

4942
03:27:15,222 --> 03:27:16,723
YOU SAY THE EU FIRST. 

4943
03:27:16,723 --> 03:27:20,361
HE REALLY DOUBLE DOWN. 

4944
03:27:20,361 --> 03:27:21,395
THERE IS THIS INTENSE FOCUS 

4945
03:27:21,395 --> 03:27:25,633
RIGHT NOW I'M TRYING TO 

4946
03:27:25,633 --> 03:27:26,300
INCREASE NATO PAYMENTS. 

4947
03:27:26,300 --> 03:27:27,334
AND REDOING THESE TRADE DEALS. 

4948
03:27:27,334 --> 03:27:28,469
IN THAT SENSE, I BELIEVE THAT 

4949
03:27:28,469 --> 03:27:30,571
THIS WHITE HOUSE AND PRESIDENCY 

4950
03:27:30,571 --> 03:27:32,940
THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A FAUX IN 

4951
03:27:32,940 --> 03:27:34,141
THAT SENSE, THAT IT IS 

4952
03:27:34,141 --> 03:27:36,410
SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE TO, 

4953
03:27:36,410 --> 03:27:37,978
NOT AN ENEMY IN WAR, BUT 

4954
03:27:37,978 --> 03:27:40,514
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT THEY 

4955
03:27:40,514 --> 03:27:42,116
BELIEVE HAS TO BE DEALT WITH 

4956
03:27:42,116 --> 03:27:45,686
IMMEDIATELY. 

4957
03:27:45,686 --> 03:27:47,354
>> DO YOU GET A SENSE OF WHAT 

4958
03:27:47,354 --> 03:27:48,589
HE WOULD CONSIDER A WIN COMING 

4959
03:27:48,589 --> 03:27:51,825
OUT OF THIS? 

4960
03:27:51,825 --> 03:27:57,664
>> HE DOES LIKE THESE ONE-ON-

4961
03:27:57,664 --> 03:27:57,998
ONE SETTINGS. 

4962
03:27:57,998 --> 03:27:59,333
AND HE BELIEVES THAT HE CAN GET 

4963
03:27:59,333 --> 03:28:00,935
A READ ON SOMEONE FAIRLY 

4964
03:28:00,935 --> 03:28:03,003
QUICKLY, BUT THAT YOU GET TO 

4965
03:28:03,003 --> 03:28:04,038
KNOW SOMEONE EVEN BETTER THE 

4966
03:28:04,038 --> 03:28:05,639
MORE TIME YOU SPEND WITH THEM. 

4967
03:28:05,639 --> 03:28:07,041
SO I DO THINK THAT WHETHER IT 

4968
03:28:07,041 --> 03:28:09,342
IS VLADIMIR PUTIN OR ANGELA 

4969
03:28:09,342 --> 03:28:15,215
MERKEL OR EMMANUEL McCRONE, 

4970
03:28:15,215 --> 03:28:15,849
WHEREVER THOSE RELATIONSHIPS 

4971
03:28:15,849 --> 03:28:20,454
HAVE GONE, HE WANTS TO SPEND 

4972
03:28:20,454 --> 03:28:20,921
MORE TIME. 

4973
03:28:20,921 --> 03:28:23,023
DOES HE WANT TO HAVE MORE OF AN 

4974
03:28:23,023 --> 03:28:24,158
OPEN CONVERSATION AND SEE HOW 

4975
03:28:24,158 --> 03:28:24,525
IT GOES? 

4976
03:28:24,525 --> 03:28:24,758
YES. 

4977
03:28:24,758 --> 03:28:25,359
I THINK SO. 

4978
03:28:25,359 --> 03:28:27,594
DOES VLADIMIR PUTIN PROBABLY 

4979
03:28:27,594 --> 03:28:30,030
HAVE MORE CONCRETE AGENDA IN 

4980
03:28:30,030 --> 03:28:31,832
TERMS OF DELIVERABLES THAT HE 

4981
03:28:31,832 --> 03:28:33,467
WANTS? 

4982
03:28:33,467 --> 03:28:33,934
YES. 

4983
03:28:33,934 --> 03:28:36,570
ARE THOSE WORKABLE BETWEEN THEM?

4984
03:28:36,570 --> 03:28:40,774
WE WILL HAVE TO SEE, SURE. 

4985
03:28:40,774 --> 03:28:42,042
BUT WHAT WILL BE INTERESTING TO 

4986
03:28:42,042 --> 03:28:43,644
SEE IS WHO BOTH OF THEM, 

4987
03:28:43,644 --> 03:28:45,679
PRESIDENT -- ESPECIALLY 

4988
03:28:45,679 --> 03:28:46,680
PRESIDENT TRUMP SPEAK TO AFTER 

4989
03:28:46,680 --> 03:28:48,315
BEFORE GOING TO THE JOINT PRESS 

4990
03:28:48,315 --> 03:28:48,648
CONFERENCE. 

4991
03:28:48,648 --> 03:28:49,683
ALSO HOW LONG THE PRESS 

4992
03:28:49,683 --> 03:28:50,016
CONFERENCES. 

4993
03:28:50,016 --> 03:28:51,285
THERE WAS THIS FASCINATING 

4994
03:28:51,285 --> 03:28:54,822
EXHAUSTIVE LONG PRESS 

4995
03:28:54,822 --> 03:28:57,925
CONFERENCE AFTER SINGAPORE. 

4996
03:28:57,925 --> 03:28:59,259
IT WAS AN HOUR AND 15 MINUTES, 

4997
03:28:59,259 --> 03:29:01,095
WILL THAT HAPPEN POST PUTIN? 

4998
03:29:01,095 --> 03:29:03,130
WHAT WILL HE SAY? 

4999
03:29:03,130 --> 03:29:11,238
>> THE OTHER INTERESTING THING, 

5000
03:29:11,238 --> 03:29:12,473
YOU ASKED HIM ABOUT THE RUSSIAN 

5001
03:29:12,473 --> 03:29:13,273
NATIONALS WHO HAVE BEEN 

5002
03:29:13,273 --> 03:29:13,540
INDICTED. 

5003
03:29:13,540 --> 03:29:16,477
THE UNITED STATES DOESN'T HAVE 

5004
03:29:16,477 --> 03:29:17,344
AN EXTRADITION TREATY WITH 

5005
03:29:17,344 --> 03:29:17,577
RUSSIA. 

5006
03:29:17,577 --> 03:29:18,746
THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE 

5007
03:29:18,746 --> 03:29:20,180
INDIVIDUALS TO FACE JUSTICE IS 

5008
03:29:20,180 --> 03:29:28,489
TO HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

5009
03:29:28,489 --> 03:29:29,556
UNITED STATES TO ASK THE 

5010
03:29:29,556 --> 03:29:30,524
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT AND HE SAID 

5011
03:29:30,524 --> 03:29:31,625
HE HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT. 

5012
03:29:31,625 --> 03:29:32,826
>> NOT JUST ONES WERE INDICTED 

5013
03:29:32,826 --> 03:29:34,228
IN THIS ROUND, BUT IN THE LAST 

5014
03:29:34,228 --> 03:29:34,828
ROUND AS WELL. 

5015
03:29:34,828 --> 03:29:36,063
YOUR TALK ABOUT A COUPLE DOZEN 

5016
03:29:36,063 --> 03:29:36,864
WHO WOULD BE EXTRADITED. 

5017
03:29:36,864 --> 03:29:38,465
IT IS HARD TO SEE A WORLD IN 

5018
03:29:38,465 --> 03:29:39,900
WHICH PUTIN WOULD SEND THEM 

5019
03:29:39,900 --> 03:29:40,734
HERE. 

5020
03:29:40,734 --> 03:29:41,969
BUT THE QUESTION IS, HOW MUCH 

5021
03:29:41,969 --> 03:29:43,470
PRESSURE IS APPLIED, HOW THAT 

5022
03:29:43,470 --> 03:29:46,640
RIP QUEST -- HOW THAT REQUEST 

5023
03:29:46,640 --> 03:29:48,776
IS MADE AND IF THERE IS ANY 

5024
03:29:48,776 --> 03:29:51,078
WIGGLE ROOM. IT IS HARD TO SEE 

5025
03:29:51,078 --> 03:29:52,479
THAT HAPPENING IN ANY WAY. 

5026
03:29:52,479 --> 03:29:55,282
BUT HE SAID HE WOULD THINK 

5027
03:29:55,282 --> 03:30:03,924
ABOUT IT. 

5028
03:30:03,924 --> 03:30:05,359
>> IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN IT COMES 

5029
03:30:05,359 --> 03:30:06,293
TO RUSSIAN MEDDLING, IT IS 

5030
03:30:06,293 --> 03:30:07,127
CONNECTED TO THE RUSSIAN 

5031
03:30:07,127 --> 03:30:07,761
INVESTIGATION FOR HIM. 

5032
03:30:07,761 --> 03:30:08,996
HE CAN'T SEPARATE THE TWO OF 

5033
03:30:08,996 --> 03:30:09,229
THEM. 

5034
03:30:09,229 --> 03:30:10,964
HE REPEATEDLY CALLED IT A WITCH 

5035
03:30:10,964 --> 03:30:13,634
HUNT AGAIN. 

5036
03:30:13,634 --> 03:30:14,868
>> I DO THINK THE SEPARATION 

5037
03:30:14,868 --> 03:30:16,070
FROM IT, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT 

5038
03:30:16,070 --> 03:30:17,805
TO TALK ABOUT, THE MEDDLING IN 

5039
03:30:17,805 --> 03:30:21,909
THE RUSSIA INTERFERENCE IS ONE 

5040
03:30:21,909 --> 03:30:23,544
THING, I THINK HE SAYS IT IS A 

5041
03:30:23,544 --> 03:30:24,845
WITCH HUNT WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT 

5042
03:30:24,845 --> 03:30:26,180
HOW IT IS GOING AFTER HIM IN 

5043
03:30:26,180 --> 03:30:26,480
PARTICULAR. 

5044
03:30:26,480 --> 03:30:27,448
THAT HE DIDN'T NECESSARILY DO 

5045
03:30:27,448 --> 03:30:27,848
ANYTHING WRONG. 

5046
03:30:27,848 --> 03:30:29,283
HOWEVER YOU DEBATE, HOW MUCH 

5047
03:30:29,283 --> 03:30:33,387
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE AFFECTED 

5048
03:30:33,387 --> 03:30:34,487
OUR ELECTION, BUT THE 

5049
03:30:34,487 --> 03:30:38,425
INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS WHAT 

5050
03:30:38,425 --> 03:30:39,226
THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 

5051
03:30:39,226 --> 03:30:40,227
INTELLIGENCE SAID, WE ARE AT 

5052
03:30:40,227 --> 03:30:43,564
THIS CRITICAL POINT AGAIN WHEN 

5053
03:30:43,564 --> 03:30:44,298
IT COMES TO OUR DIGITAL 

5054
03:30:44,298 --> 03:30:44,665
INFRASTRUCTURE. 

5055
03:30:44,665 --> 03:30:45,966
HE THINKS WE ARE AT THIS POINT 

5056
03:30:45,966 --> 03:30:47,134
LIKE WE WERE PRE-9/11 IN TERMS 

5057
03:30:47,134 --> 03:30:56,143
OF CLOSE TO A POTENTIAL MAJOR 

5058
03:30:56,143 --> 03:30:56,476
BAD ATTACK. 

5059
03:30:56,476 --> 03:30:57,678
THOSE ARE THE SIGNS THAT THEY 

5060
03:30:57,678 --> 03:30:58,679
ARE SEEING FROM THE RUSSIANS 

5061
03:30:58,679 --> 03:30:59,980
AND NORTH KOREANS IN TERMS OF 

5062
03:30:59,980 --> 03:31:01,581
WHAT THEY MAY BE ABLE TO 

5063
03:31:01,581 --> 03:31:04,818
PENETRATE. 

5064
03:31:04,818 --> 03:31:05,786
>> AND THE NORTH KOREANS. 

5065
03:31:05,786 --> 03:31:07,020
>> THE WORLD HAS CHANGED IS 

5066
03:31:07,020 --> 03:31:07,588
EVIDENT IN YOU. 

5067
03:31:07,588 --> 03:31:08,889
YOU CARRY OUT TERROR ATTACKS IN 

5068
03:31:08,889 --> 03:31:10,123
DIFFERENT WAYS THAN YOU DID 20 

5069
03:31:10,123 --> 03:31:10,491
YEARS AGO. 

5070
03:31:10,491 --> 03:31:11,925
I ASKED HIM ABOUT WHAT THE D 

5071
03:31:11,925 --> 03:31:15,829
AND I SAID. 

5072
03:31:15,829 --> 03:31:18,632
HE SAID HE WAS AWARE OF THAT. 

5073
03:31:18,632 --> 03:31:19,867
I THINK SOME OF THE COMMENTS 

5074
03:31:19,867 --> 03:31:28,375
HAVE BEEN INTERESTING. 

5075
03:31:28,375 --> 03:31:29,777
>> YOU PLAN TO INTERVIEW HIM ON 

5076
03:31:29,777 --> 03:31:30,778
WEDNESDAY, GIVEN WHAT HE SAID 

5077
03:31:30,778 --> 03:31:32,079
THIS WEEKEND AND WE EXPECT TO 

5078
03:31:32,079 --> 03:31:33,280
SEE COME OUT OF THIS RUSSIA 

5079
03:31:33,280 --> 03:31:36,450
MEETING, GIVE US A PREVIEW. 

5080
03:31:36,450 --> 03:31:37,918
>> WE WILL ASK HIM ABOUT WHAT 

5081
03:31:37,918 --> 03:31:38,986
HAPPENED IN HELSINKI AND WHAT 

5082
03:31:38,986 --> 03:31:40,120
HIS SENSE OF, HE WILL HAVE 

5083
03:31:40,120 --> 03:31:41,889
TALKED ABOUT IT A COUPLE TIMES. 

5084
03:31:41,889 --> 03:31:43,991
I THINK WHAT IS INTERESTING AND 

5085
03:31:43,991 --> 03:31:45,425
APPEALING FOR US IS WE GET A 

5086
03:31:45,425 --> 03:31:47,427
CHANCE TO TALK TO HIM AT THE 

5087
03:31:47,427 --> 03:31:49,730
WHITE HOUSE WHEN I THINK HE HAS 

5088
03:31:49,730 --> 03:31:51,198
HAD A CHANCE TO RESET A LITTLE 

5089
03:31:51,198 --> 03:31:51,765
BIT BACK HERE. 

5090
03:31:51,765 --> 03:31:53,466
AND TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THINGS 

5091
03:31:53,466 --> 03:31:55,502
GO POST MEETING AND POST SUMMIT.

5092
03:31:55,502 --> 03:31:58,038
WHATEVER YOU CARE TO CALL IT. 

5093
03:31:58,038 --> 03:32:00,240
AFTER THAT, WHAT COMES NEXT WITH

5094
03:32:00,240 --> 03:32:01,842
VLADIMIR PUTIN NOW THAT THEY 

5095
03:32:01,842 --> 03:32:08,549
WILL HAVE MET 3 1/2 TIMES. 

5096
03:32:08,549 --> 03:32:09,817
>> WE HAVE BEEN ANALYZING BODY 

5097
03:32:09,817 --> 03:32:10,084
LANGUAGE. 

5098
03:32:10,084 --> 03:32:14,688
THAT'S ALL WE HAVE REALLY HAD. 

5099
03:32:14,688 --> 03:32:16,290
SO I WANT TO GET A SENSE FROM 

5100
03:32:16,290 --> 03:32:17,357
YOU, THAT HE SEEMED RELAXED? 

5101
03:32:17,357 --> 03:32:18,125
>> IT'S THE SAME. 

5102
03:32:18,125 --> 03:32:19,193
THE PRESIDENT PREFERS TO SIT 

5103
03:32:19,193 --> 03:32:20,994
FORWARD LIKE THIS. 

5104
03:32:20,994 --> 03:32:22,596
AND VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS A LITTLE 

5105
03:32:22,596 --> 03:32:27,901
BIT MORE, HE HAD HIS LIEN. 

5106
03:32:27,901 --> 03:32:28,702
IT WAS THE SAME. 

5107
03:32:28,702 --> 03:32:30,103
THE WAY I EXPECTED HIM TO SIT 

5108
03:32:30,103 --> 03:32:36,643
IN ALL OF THESE, AND FOR ME, 

5109
03:32:36,643 --> 03:32:37,578
SITTING ACROSS, I'M TRYING TO 

5110
03:32:37,578 --> 03:32:38,612
BE COMFORTABLE AND MAKE SURE 

5111
03:32:38,612 --> 03:32:41,048
WHOEVER IT IS I'M COMFORTABLE, 

5112
03:32:41,048 --> 03:32:43,117
THAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE. 

5113
03:32:43,117 --> 03:32:44,818
YOU COULD TALK ABOUT THE BODY 

5114
03:32:44,818 --> 03:32:46,653
LANGUAGE ALL DAY LONG. 

5115
03:32:46,653 --> 03:32:48,355
WHETHER IT IS THIS OR WHETHER 

5116
03:32:48,355 --> 03:32:50,023
IT IS VLADIMIR PUTIN AND TRUMP 

5117
03:32:50,023 --> 03:32:56,163
MEETING. 

5118
03:32:56,163 --> 03:32:57,197
IT IS SUPER FASCINATING TO 

5119
03:32:57,197 --> 03:32:57,597
SPECULATE ABOUT. 

5120
03:32:57,597 --> 03:32:58,832
I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH IT 

5121
03:32:58,832 --> 03:32:59,232
ACTUALLY MEANS. 

5122
03:32:59,232 --> 03:33:00,200
BUT IT IS INTERESTING. 

5123
03:33:00,200 --> 03:33:01,401
>> WE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS 

5124
03:33:01,401 --> 03:33:04,238

MADE. 

5135
03:33:19,719 --> 03:33:20,921

ONE FATHER TOLD US IT WAS VERY 

5221
03:36:03,216 --> 03:36:04,384
SPOOKY FOR HIM, BECAUSE HE HAD 

5222
03:36:04,384 --> 03:36:05,419
BEEN REPAIRING HIMSELF FOR THE 

5223
03:36:05,419 --> 03:36:07,320
IDEA THAT HIS SON MIGHT NEVER

SHE MANAGED TO SURVIVE IT FOR 

5234
03:36:25,739 --> 03:36:33,313
SEVEN DAYS BEFORE SHE WAS FOUND.

5235

WE SAID THERE IS A BUMPER, 

5237
03:36:36,116 --> 03:36:36,483
THAT'S WEIRD. 

5238
03:36:36,483 --> 03:36:37,751
WE CAME AROUND ANOTHER BEND AND 

5239
03:36:37,751 --> 03:36:38,351

ROCKY 250 FOOT CLIFF. 

5251

THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER AFTER 

5252
03:37:05,579 --> 03:37:14,121
THAT WAS WAKING UP. I COULD 

5253
03:37:14,121 --> 03:37:15,088
FEEL WATER RISING OVER MY 

5254
03:37:15,088 --> 03:37:15,321
KNEES. 

5255
03:37:15,321 --> 03:37:16,890
I WAS ABLE TO BREAK OUT OF MY 

5256
03:37:16,890 --> 03:37:18,158
CAR AND JUMP INTO THE OCEAN. 

5257
03:37:18,158 --> 03:37:19,359
I SWAM TO SHORE AND FELL 

5258
03:37:19,359 --> 03:37:19,593
ASLEEP. 

5259
03:37:19,593 --> 03:37:21,027
SHE SAYS THE NEXT FEW DAYS WERE 

5260
03:37:21,027 --> 03:37:21,394
A BLUR. 

5261
03:37:21,394 --> 03:37:22,696
SHE WANTED THE BEACH YELLING IN

SHE FOUND A 10 INCH HOSE IN HER

5265
03:37:25,298 --> 03:37:26,466
>> SHE WOULD LAY UNDER THE 

5266

ROCKS AND LET WATER DRIP OFF OF 

5267
03:37:27,934 --> 03:37:30,704
THE ROCKS ONTO THE HOSE. 

5268
03:37:30,704 --> 03:37:31,972
WE TURNED AROUND AND SHE WAS 

5269
03:37:31,972 --> 03:37:38,712
RIGHT THERE ON THE ROCKS. 

5270
03:37:38,712 --> 03:37:39,646
IT JUST LOOKED LIKE HELL.

03:37:42,282 --> 03:37:42,916
ACROSS THE SHORE. 

5274
03:37:42,916 --> 03:37:44,117
I THOUGHT SHE WAS A DREAM. 

5275

BUT WHAT MAKES HIM TICK? 

5324
03:42:17,557 --> 03:42:20,226
HE WAS TRAINED AS A KGB AGENT 

5325
03:42:20,226 --> 03:42:21,628
DURING THE COLD WAR, AND IT IS 

5326
03:42:21,628 --> 03:42:22,995
IN HIS DNA TO VIEW THE UNITED 

5327
03:42:22,995 --> 03:42:23,863

03:56:39,017 --> 03:56:40,185
WE HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON 

5572
03:56:40,185 --> 03:56:43,022
EVERYTHING FROM TRADE TO 

5573
03:56:43,022 --> 03:56:44,657
MILITARY TO MISSILES TO NUCLEAR 

5574
03:56:44,657 --> 03:56:48,227
TO CHINA, WE'LL BE TALKING A 

5575
03:56:48,227 --> 03:56:50,962
LITTLE BIT ABOUT CHINA. 

5576
03:56:50,962 --> 03:56:51,996
A MUTUAL FRIEND, PRESIDENT XI. 

5577
03:56:51,996 --> 03:56:53,766
I THINK WE HAVE GREAT 

5578
03:56:53,766 --> 03:56:55,434
OPPORTUNITIES TOGETHER AS TWO 

5579
03:56:55,434 --> 03:56:57,036
COUNTRIES THAT FRANKLY, WE HAVE 

5580
03:56:57,036 --> 03:56:58,103
NOT BEEN GETTING ALONG VERY 

5581
03:56:58,103 --> 03:56:59,638
WELL FOR THE LAST NUMBER OF 

5582
03:56:59,638 --> 03:56:59,871
YEARS. 

5583
03:56:59,871 --> 03:57:01,206
I HAVE BEEN HERE NOT TOO LONG, 

5584
03:57:01,206 --> 03:57:02,508
BUT IT'S GETTING CLOSE TO TWO 

5585
03:57:02,508 --> 03:57:04,677
YEARS, BUT I THINK WE WILL END 

5586
03:57:04,677 --> 03:57:06,111
UP HAVING AN EXTRAORDINARY 

5587
03:57:06,111 --> 03:57:06,444
RELATIONSHIP. 

5588
03:57:06,444 --> 03:57:06,778
I HOPE SO. 

5589
03:57:06,778 --> 03:57:08,647
I HAVE BEEN SAYING IT, AND I'M 

5590
03:57:08,647 --> 03:57:09,982
SURE YOU'VE HEARD OVER THE 

5591
03:57:09,982 --> 03:57:11,417
YEARS AND AS I CAMPAIGNED THAT 

5592
03:57:11,417 --> 03:57:12,885
GETTING ALONG WITH RUSSIA IS A 

5593
03:57:12,885 --> 03:57:14,820
GOOD THING, NOT A BAD THING. 

5594
03:57:14,820 --> 03:57:16,555
AND I REALLY THINK THE WORLD 

5595
03:57:16,555 --> 03:57:18,924
WANTS TO SEE US GETTING ALONG. 

5596
03:57:18,924 --> 03:57:23,295
WE ARE THE TWO GREAT NUCLEAR 

5597
03:57:23,295 --> 03:57:23,528
POWERS. 

5598
03:57:23,528 --> 03:57:24,897
WE HAVE 90% OF THE NUCLEAR AND 

5599
03:57:24,897 --> 03:57:26,198
THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING. 

5600
03:57:26,198 --> 03:57:27,866
IT'S A BAD THING, AND I THINK 

5601
03:57:27,866 --> 03:57:29,468
WE HOPEFULLY CAN DO SOMETHING 

5602
03:57:29,468 --> 03:57:31,837
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A 

5603
03:57:31,837 --> 03:57:32,237
POSITIVE FORCE. 

5604
03:57:32,237 --> 03:57:33,772
IT'S A NEGATIVE FORCE. 

5605
03:57:33,772 --> 03:57:35,674
SO WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT 

5606
03:57:35,674 --> 03:57:37,209
AMONG OTHER THINGS. 

5607
03:57:37,209 --> 03:57:38,711
>> LET'S TURN TO CBS NEWS CHIEF 

5608
03:57:38,711 --> 03:57:39,745
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT MAJOR 

5609
03:57:39,745 --> 03:57:42,381
GARRETT, HE JOINS US NOW FROM 

5610
03:57:42,381 --> 03:57:42,648
HELSINKI. 

5611
03:57:42,648 --> 03:57:44,983
MAJOR, PUT THIS MEETING IN 

5612
03:57:44,983 --> 03:57:45,984
CONTEXT FOR US. 

5613
03:57:45,984 --> 03:57:47,085
WHAT IS AT STAKE? 

5614
03:57:47,085 --> 03:57:48,787
AND I THINK IT'S HARD TO FIGURE 

5615
03:57:48,787 --> 03:57:50,089
OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S AT STAKE 

5616
03:57:50,089 --> 03:57:52,925
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S ON 

5617
03:57:52,925 --> 03:57:53,825
THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA, REALLY. 

5618
03:57:53,825 --> 03:57:54,860
>> Reporter: RIGHT, WE DON'T 

5619
03:57:54,860 --> 03:57:56,027
KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE. 

5620
03:57:56,027 --> 03:57:57,429
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT ON 

5621
03:57:57,429 --> 03:57:59,331
THE OTHER SIDE OF THESE TWO 

5622
03:57:59,331 --> 03:58:02,034
MEETINGS, FIRST THE ONE ON ONE 

5623
03:58:02,034 --> 03:58:04,269
MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP 

5624
03:58:04,269 --> 03:58:06,772
AND PRESIDENT PUTIN, THEN THE 

5625
03:58:06,772 --> 03:58:07,973
EXTENDED MEETING WHERE RUSSIAN 

5626
03:58:07,973 --> 03:58:09,108
ADVISERS, AND AMERICANS WILL BE 

5627
03:58:09,108 --> 03:58:10,709
IN THE ROOM TO HASH OUT WHAT 

5628
03:58:10,709 --> 03:58:12,044
WAS SAID IN THE PRIVATE 

5629
03:58:12,044 --> 03:58:12,311
MEETING. 

5630
03:58:12,311 --> 03:58:13,011
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR WHATEVER 

5631
03:58:13,011 --> 03:58:14,546
REASON HAS BEEN COMPLETELY 

5632
03:58:14,546 --> 03:58:16,715
VAGUE ABOUT HIS OWN INTENTIONS 

5633
03:58:16,715 --> 03:58:18,850
GOING INTO THIS SUMMIT. 

5634
03:58:18,850 --> 03:58:20,686
WHAT ISSUES DOES HE CARE TO 

5635
03:58:20,686 --> 03:58:21,920
DRIVE WITH THE RUSSIAN 

5636
03:58:21,920 --> 03:58:22,821
PRESIDENT, WHAT INTERESTS OF 

5637
03:58:22,821 --> 03:58:24,256
THE UNITED STATES IS HE GOING 

5638
03:58:24,256 --> 03:58:26,225
TO BRING TO BEAR UP AGAINST THE 

5639
03:58:26,225 --> 03:58:27,659
RUSSIAN LEADER AND WHAT IS HE 

5640
03:58:27,659 --> 03:58:31,029
GOING TO TRY TO EXTRACT IN 

5641
03:58:31,029 --> 03:58:32,498
TERMS OF CONCESSIONS FROM THE 

5642
03:58:32,498 --> 03:58:32,965
RUSSIANS. 

5643
03:58:32,965 --> 03:58:34,767
OR TO GET THEM SIMPLY TO LIVE 

5644
03:58:34,767 --> 03:58:35,834
UP TO AGREEMENTS THEY HAVE 

5645
03:58:35,834 --> 03:58:36,869
ALREADY MADE WITH THIS 

5646
03:58:36,869 --> 03:58:38,036
PRESIDENT IN PLACES, FOR 

5647
03:58:38,036 --> 03:58:38,837
EXAMPLE, LIKE SYRIA. 

5648
03:58:38,837 --> 03:58:39,872
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 

5649
03:58:39,872 --> 03:58:42,174
PRESIDENT WANTS OUT OF THIS 

5650
03:58:42,174 --> 03:58:42,441
MEETING. 

5651
03:58:42,441 --> 03:58:43,675
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS UNTIL 

5652
03:58:43,675 --> 03:58:45,110
YESTERDAY WHEN THE PRESIDENT 

5653
03:58:45,110 --> 03:58:46,845
DECLARED THIS A SUMMIT ON 

5654
03:58:46,845 --> 03:58:49,281
TWITTER, ALL OF HIS SENIOR 

5655
03:58:49,281 --> 03:58:50,048
ADVISERS, PUBLICLY AND 

5656
03:58:50,048 --> 03:58:52,985
PRIVATELY WERE SAYING TO 

5657
03:58:52,985 --> 03:58:54,119
REPORTERS LIKE ME, DON'T YOU 

5658
03:58:54,119 --> 03:58:55,420
DARE CALL THIS A SUMMIT. 

5659
03:58:55,420 --> 03:58:56,087
IT'S A MEETING. 

5660
03:58:56,087 --> 03:58:58,657
A SUMMIT HAS TOO BIG OF AN 

5661
03:58:58,657 --> 03:58:59,992
AGENDA, SETS TOO HIGH OF 

5662
03:58:59,992 --> 03:59:00,893
EXPECTATIONS, THEN WHAT DOES 

5663
03:59:00,893 --> 03:59:02,027
PRESIDENT TRUMP CALL IT ON 

5664
03:59:02,027 --> 03:59:03,595
TWITTER, HE CALLS IT A SUMMIT. 

5665
03:59:03,595 --> 03:59:05,030
THAT SUGGESTS A COUPLE OF 

5666
03:59:05,030 --> 03:59:06,965
THINGS, ONE, A DECOUPLING FROM 

5667
03:59:06,965 --> 03:59:08,600
HIS OWN ADVISERS ABOUT HOW TO 

5668
03:59:08,600 --> 03:59:10,969
SET EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS 

5669
03:59:10,969 --> 03:59:12,371
ENCOUNTER, AND TWO, IT SUGGESTS 

5670
03:59:12,371 --> 03:59:14,940
THAT EVEN WHEN THOSE CLOSEST TO 

5671
03:59:14,940 --> 03:59:16,542
THE PRESIDENT ARE TRYING TO 

5672
03:59:16,542 --> 03:59:18,677
HELP HIM BY MAINTAINING A LOWER 

5673
03:59:18,677 --> 03:59:19,711
LEVEL OF EXPECTATIONS, THE 

5674
03:59:19,711 --> 03:59:22,448
PRESIDENT EITHER DOESN'T TAKE 

5675
03:59:22,448 --> 03:59:23,682
THAT HELP SERIOUSLY OR DEFIES 

5676
03:59:23,682 --> 03:59:25,517
IT FOR HIS OWN REASON AND I CAN 

5677
03:59:25,517 --> 03:59:29,121
TELL YOU WHEN I WAS IN BRUSSELS 

5678
03:59:29,121 --> 03:59:30,355
TALKING TO NATO MINISTERS AND 

5679
03:59:30,355 --> 03:59:31,857
TALKING TO THOSE IN THE UNITED 

5680
03:59:31,857 --> 03:59:32,958
STATES IN PREPARATION FOR 

5681
03:59:32,958 --> 03:59:34,326
COVERING THIS SUMMIT, EACH AND 

5682
03:59:34,326 --> 03:59:35,494
EVERY MOMENT IN THIS EXTENDED 

5683
03:59:35,494 --> 03:59:37,029
PERIOD OF TIME THAT PRESIDENT 

5684
03:59:37,029 --> 03:59:38,363
TRUMP SPENDS ONE ON ONE WITH 

5685
03:59:38,363 --> 03:59:40,032
VLADIMIR PUTIN RAISES THE LEVEL 

5686
03:59:40,032 --> 03:59:42,267
OF ANXIETY, AND EUROPEAN 

5687
03:59:42,267 --> 03:59:44,469
CAPITALS AND BACK HOME. 

5688
03:59:44,469 --> 03:59:44,770
WHY? 

5689
03:59:44,770 --> 03:59:46,371
BECAUSE IN THIS STATE CRAFT, 

5690
03:59:46,371 --> 03:59:48,407
PUTIN IS A MUCH MORE 

5691
03:59:48,407 --> 03:59:50,175
EXPERIENCED NEGOTIATOR, KNOWS 

5692
03:59:50,175 --> 03:59:53,545
WHAT HIS AGENDA IS, DRIVES HIS 

5693
03:59:53,545 --> 03:59:54,880
BARGAIN HIS WAY, CAPABLE OF 

5694
03:59:54,880 --> 03:59:55,848
FLATTERING NOT JUST THIS 

5695
03:59:55,848 --> 03:59:57,549
PRESIDENT BUT OTHER AMERICAN 

5696
03:59:57,549 --> 03:59:59,151
PRESIDENTS AND GETTING HIS WAY 

5697
03:59:59,151 --> 04:00:01,353
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. 

5698
04:00:01,353 --> 04:00:03,522
SO THAT'S A CONSTRUCT THAT 

5699
04:00:03,522 --> 04:00:05,524
CREATES SOME DEGREE OF ANXIETY 

5700
04:00:05,524 --> 04:00:06,358
AMONG AMERICAN ALLIES. 

5701
04:00:06,358 --> 04:00:09,528
WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAPPEN IN 

5702
04:00:09,528 --> 04:00:10,596
THIS PRIVATE ENCOUNTER AND WHAT 

5703
04:00:10,596 --> 04:00:11,930
WILL VLADIMIR PUTIN SAY ON THE 

5704
04:00:11,930 --> 04:00:13,932
OTHER SIDE OF IT IN TERMS OF 

5705
04:00:13,932 --> 04:00:16,869
ISSUES HE'S TRIED TO DRIVE WITH 

5706
04:00:16,869 --> 04:00:18,637
THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT. 

5707
04:00:18,637 --> 04:00:20,038
BY ENTERING WITH A VAGUE 

5708
04:00:20,038 --> 04:00:21,173
AGENDA, IT CREATES AN OPENING, 

5709
04:00:21,173 --> 04:00:22,941
AT LEAST AN OPENING FOR PUTIN 

5710
04:00:22,941 --> 04:00:24,943
TO GET MORE OF WHAT HE WANTS 

5711
04:00:24,943 --> 04:00:26,844
BECAUSE HE WILL HAVE DEFINED IT 

5712
04:00:26,844 --> 04:00:27,646
UP FRONT. 

5713
04:00:27,646 --> 04:00:29,715
>> AND MAJOR, WHAT IS THE WHITE 

5714
04:00:29,715 --> 04:00:30,849
HOUSE SAYING ABOUT THAT VAGUE 

5715
04:00:30,849 --> 04:00:32,351
AGENDA WHEN FOR A LOT OF 

5716
04:00:32,351 --> 04:00:33,785
AMERICANS, A LOT OF MEMBERS OF 

5717
04:00:33,785 --> 04:00:35,087
CONGRESS, THERE COULD BE A 

5718
04:00:35,087 --> 04:00:36,255
COUPLE OF SPECIFIC THINGS THE 

5719
04:00:36,255 --> 04:00:37,890
PRESIDENT COULD SAY HE WANTS TO 

5720
04:00:37,890 --> 04:00:38,223
TALK ABOUT. 

5721
04:00:38,223 --> 04:00:40,826
HE COULD SAY HE WANTS TO TALK 

5722
04:00:40,826 --> 04:00:41,193
ABOUT CRIMEA. 

5723
04:00:41,193 --> 04:00:42,661
HE COULD SAY HE WANTS TO TALK 

5724
04:00:42,661 --> 04:00:44,062
ABOUT THE POISONING OF UK 

5725
04:00:44,062 --> 04:00:45,030
CITIZENS ON THEIR SOIL. 

5726
04:00:45,030 --> 04:00:47,299
HE CAN SAY THAT HE WANTS TO 

5727
04:00:47,299 --> 04:00:48,734
TALK ABOUT THOSE 12 RUSSIAN 

5728
04:00:48,734 --> 04:00:49,968
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS THAT 

5729
04:00:49,968 --> 04:00:52,271
WERE JUST INDICTED BY THE 

5730
04:00:52,271 --> 04:00:53,438
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, BUT YET 

5731
04:00:53,438 --> 04:00:55,474
HE LEFT IT TO WE'RE GOING TO 

5732
04:00:55,474 --> 04:00:56,842
TALK ABOUT CHINA, WE WANT TO 

5733
04:00:56,842 --> 04:00:58,343
TALK ABOUT NUCLEAR, WE WANT TO 

5734
04:00:58,343 --> 04:00:59,344
HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. 

5735
04:00:59,344 --> 04:01:00,212
HOW IS THE WHITE HOUSE 

5736
04:01:00,212 --> 04:01:02,781
RESPONDING TO THAT LINE OF 

5737
04:01:02,781 --> 04:01:03,948
THINKING FROM OTHER AMERICANS? 

5738
04:01:03,948 --> 04:01:05,517
>> Reporter: THAT THE PRESIDENT 

5739
04:01:05,517 --> 04:01:07,753
SETS THE AGENDA, AND THAT'S IT, 

5740
04:01:07,753 --> 04:01:09,388
AND HE'S THE DEAL MAKER AND 

5741
04:01:09,388 --> 04:01:10,622
HE'S THE CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, AND 

5742
04:01:10,622 --> 04:01:13,191
WHAT HE SAYS GOES, THAT GOES 

5743
04:01:13,191 --> 04:01:14,359
BACK TO THIS DECOUPLING I 

5744
04:01:14,359 --> 04:01:15,260
TALKED ABOUT, WHETHER TO 

5745
04:01:15,260 --> 04:01:16,995
DESCRIBE THIS AS A SUMMIT OR A 

5746
04:01:16,995 --> 04:01:18,897
MEETING, ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ON 

5747
04:01:18,897 --> 04:01:20,098
BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT WERE 

5748
04:01:20,098 --> 04:01:22,301
WORKING OVERTIME TO SAY IT'S A 

5749
04:01:22,301 --> 04:01:23,268
MEETING, LOWER EXPECTATIONS, 

5750
04:01:23,268 --> 04:01:24,670
THE PRESIDENT CALLS IT A 

5751
04:01:24,670 --> 04:01:24,937
SUMMIT. 

5752
04:01:24,937 --> 04:01:25,971
THAT MEANS HE'S RUNNING THE 

5753
04:01:25,971 --> 04:01:26,171
SHOW. 

5754
04:01:26,171 --> 04:01:28,106
HE'S AT THE TOP AND HE DEFINES 

5755
04:01:28,106 --> 04:01:29,441
HIS OWN REALITY AND DEFINES 

5756
04:01:29,441 --> 04:01:30,809
WHATEVER THE CONTOURS OF WHAT 

5757
04:01:30,809 --> 04:01:32,544
HE WANTS TO NEGOTIATE IN THE 

5758
04:01:32,544 --> 04:01:36,515
MOMENT AT THAT TIME. 

5759
04:01:36,515 --> 04:01:39,251
THEN HE LEAVES IT TO HIS 

5760
04:01:39,251 --> 04:01:41,753
ADVISERS TO SORT OUT AND COPE 

5761
04:01:41,753 --> 04:01:42,754
WITH THE CONSEQUENCES, LET'S 

5762
04:01:42,754 --> 04:01:44,022
REMIND OURSELVES HOW THAT 

5763
04:01:44,022 --> 04:01:45,190
PLAYED OUT IN SINGAPORE WITH 

5764
04:01:45,190 --> 04:01:46,591
THE SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN. 

5765
04:01:46,591 --> 04:01:47,659
NO ONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION 

5766
04:01:47,659 --> 04:01:48,961
EXPECTED THE PRESIDENT TO AT 

5767
04:01:48,961 --> 04:01:50,495
THAT MEETING GIVE UP JOINT 

5768
04:01:50,495 --> 04:01:51,496
MILITARY EXERCISES WITH THE 

5769
04:01:51,496 --> 04:01:52,431
SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT, YET 

5770
04:01:52,431 --> 04:01:54,766
THE PRESIDENT DID, AND WHEN HE 

5771
04:01:54,766 --> 04:02:00,505
ANNOUNCED IT, IT SURPRISED THE 

5772
04:02:00,505 --> 04:02:01,974
SOUTH KOREANS, THE PENTAGON, 

5773
04:02:01,974 --> 04:02:02,740
OUR JAPANESE ALLIES. 

5774
04:02:02,740 --> 04:02:05,344
THE PRESIDENT MADE A DEAL IN 

5775
04:02:05,344 --> 04:02:06,345
THE MOMENT, FACE-TO-FACE, AND 

5776
04:02:06,345 --> 04:02:08,780
EVERYONE ELSE HAD TO ADAPT TO 

5777
04:02:08,780 --> 04:02:10,148
IT AFTERWARDS AND IN SO 

5778
04:02:10,148 --> 04:02:11,650
ANNOUNCING THE END OF JOINT 

5779
04:02:11,650 --> 04:02:12,351
MILITARY EXERCISES, PRESIDENT 

5780
04:02:12,351 --> 04:02:13,852
TRUMP USED THE VERY LANGUAGE 

5781
04:02:13,852 --> 04:02:15,821
THE NORTH KOREAN LANGUAGE HAD 

5782
04:02:15,821 --> 04:02:17,756
ALREADY USED, THEY WERE 

5783
04:02:17,756 --> 04:02:19,891
PROVOCATIVE, SO THAT'S AN 

5784
04:02:19,891 --> 04:02:21,293
EXAMPLE, A CLASSIC, THEREFORE, 

5785
04:02:21,293 --> 04:02:23,996
EVERYONE TO SEE EXAMPLE OF WHAT 

5786
04:02:23,996 --> 04:02:25,063
CAN HAPPEN IN THESE ONE-ON-ONE 

5787
04:02:25,063 --> 04:02:26,031
MEETINGS WHERE THE PRESIDENT 

5788
04:02:26,031 --> 04:02:27,432
WALKS IN, THOSE AROUND HIM 

5789
04:02:27,432 --> 04:02:29,668
DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS AGENDA IS, 

5790
04:02:29,668 --> 04:02:32,437
DON'T KNOW WHAT HE AGREES TO, 

5791
04:02:32,437 --> 04:02:37,476
AGREES TO IT, AND TURNS AROUND 

5792
04:02:37,476 --> 04:02:40,512
TO EVERYONE ELSE AND SAYS MAKE 

5793
04:02:40,512 --> 04:02:40,812
IT WORK. 

5794
04:02:40,812 --> 04:02:41,880
WHAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP GOING 

5795
04:02:41,880 --> 04:02:44,016
TO SAY TO HIS ADVISERS AFTER 

5796
04:02:44,016 --> 04:02:45,550
HIS LENGTHY MEETING WITH PUTIN 

5797
04:02:45,550 --> 04:02:46,952
AND SAY THAT'S WHAT I HAVE 

5798
04:02:46,952 --> 04:02:48,220
AGREED TO, MAKE IT WORK. 

5799
04:02:48,220 --> 04:02:50,756
TO YOUR POINT, HE HAS GIVEN NO 

5800
04:02:50,756 --> 04:02:53,258
INDICATION THAT HE IS 

5801
04:02:53,258 --> 04:02:54,293
PASSIONATELY OR INTELLECTUALLY 

5802
04:02:54,293 --> 04:02:55,327
OR POLITICALLY MOTIVATED TO 

5803
04:02:55,327 --> 04:02:56,795
DRIVING THIS ISSUE OF RUSSIAN 

5804
04:02:56,795 --> 04:02:58,864
MEDDLING IN THE ELECTION HARD, 

5805
04:02:58,864 --> 04:03:00,632
PAST OR PRESENT, AND HIS 

5806
04:03:00,632 --> 04:03:01,900
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN 

5807
04:03:01,900 --> 04:03:05,470
SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS ABOUT WHAT 

5808
04:03:05,470 --> 04:03:06,805
TO SAY ABOUT RUSSIANS IN 

5809
04:03:06,805 --> 04:03:07,038
CRIMEA. 

5810
04:03:07,038 --> 04:03:08,273
THEY HAVEN'T SAID THEY WILL 

5811
04:03:08,273 --> 04:03:09,107
RECOGNIZE IT OFFICIALLY BUT 

5812
04:03:09,107 --> 04:03:10,408
THEY HAVEN'T RULED IT OUT. 

5813
04:03:10,408 --> 04:03:11,443
THAT'S AN OPENING FOR THE 

5814
04:03:11,443 --> 04:03:13,679
RUSSIANS, AND I CAN TELL YOU IN 

5815
04:03:13,679 --> 04:03:14,613
BRUSSELS, ANOTHER BIG TOPIC, 

5816
04:03:14,613 --> 04:03:17,182
IT'S NOT A HUGE ISSUE BUT IT'S 

5817
04:03:17,182 --> 04:03:19,951
ONE THAT'S CENTRAL TO THE 

5818
04:03:19,951 --> 04:03:22,554
FUTURE OF THE NATO ALLIANCE, 

5819
04:03:22,554 --> 04:03:24,089
JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES IN THE 

5820
04:03:24,089 --> 04:03:26,858
BALTICS, NATO WANTS THEM TO 

5821
04:03:26,858 --> 04:03:28,593
CONTINUE AS A SIGNAL TO MOSCOW, 

5822
04:03:28,593 --> 04:03:29,695
DON'T MESS AROUND IN THE 

5823
04:03:29,695 --> 04:03:31,063
BALTICS, YOU HAVE TO KEEP AN 

5824
04:03:31,063 --> 04:03:32,197
EYE ON THAT AS WELL. 

5825
04:03:32,197 --> 04:03:33,398
>> YOU BROUGHT UP THE RUSSIAN 

5826
04:03:33,398 --> 04:03:34,733
MING AND OF COURSE THIS IS 

5827
04:03:34,733 --> 04:03:39,438
COMING AFTER WE FOUND OUT ON 

5828
04:03:39,438 --> 04:03:40,538
FRIDAY, 12 RUSSIAN OFFICERS. 

5829
04:03:40,538 --> 04:03:41,840
I THINK MY QUESTION TO YOU 

5830
04:03:41,840 --> 04:03:43,075
MAJOR IS, YOU KNOW, THE 

5831
04:03:43,075 --> 04:03:44,443
PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT HE 

5832
04:03:44,443 --> 04:03:46,411
MIGHT BRING IT UP, NOT REALLY 

5833
04:03:46,411 --> 04:03:48,780
SORT OF TOP OF HIS AGENDA, BUT 

5834
04:03:48,780 --> 04:03:51,249
WHAT CAN HE REALLY SAY. 

5835
04:03:51,249 --> 04:03:53,518
WHAT ARE HIS OPTIONS, YOU KNOW, 

5836
04:03:53,518 --> 04:03:54,419
PRESIDENT OBAMA FAMOUSLY TOLD 

5837
04:03:54,419 --> 04:03:58,490
VLADIMIR PUTIN TO CUT IT OUT, 

5838
04:03:58,490 --> 04:03:59,390
DIDN'T MAKE MUCH OF A 

5839
04:03:59,390 --> 04:03:59,925
DIFFERENCE. 

5840
04:03:59,925 --> 04:04:02,360
>> Reporter: WHEN IT COMES TO 

5841
04:04:02,360 --> 04:04:03,962
OPTIONS, YOU CAN USE THE VOICE 

5842
04:04:03,962 --> 04:04:07,499
OF AMERICA, THE PRESIDENCY OF 

5843
04:04:07,499 --> 04:04:09,101
THE UNITED STATES, AND AS THE 

5844
04:04:09,101 --> 04:04:10,435
ESSENTIALLY REPOSITORY AT THE 

5845
04:04:10,435 --> 04:04:11,570
TOP OF THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY 

5846
04:04:11,570 --> 04:04:13,872
TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, WE IN 

5847
04:04:13,872 --> 04:04:14,773
AMERICA CARE ABOUT OUR 

5848
04:04:14,773 --> 04:04:16,875
DEMOCRACY, AND WE'RE GOING TO 

5849
04:04:16,875 --> 04:04:19,444
PROTECT IT, AND YOU INVADED IT 

5850
04:04:19,444 --> 04:04:20,478
IN A HOSTILE ACT. 

5851
04:04:20,478 --> 04:04:22,881
WE KNOW IT, THE INDICTMENTS ARE 

5852
04:04:22,881 --> 04:04:24,515
REAL, THE FACTS ARE THERE. 

5853
04:04:24,515 --> 04:04:25,549
THIS HAPPENED AT THE HIGHEST 

5854
04:04:25,549 --> 04:04:26,651
LEVELS OF YOUR GOVERNMENT. 

5855
04:04:26,651 --> 04:04:27,786
WE KNOW IT, YOU SHOULD KNOW 

5856
04:04:27,786 --> 04:04:29,688
THAT WE KNOW IT, AND WE WILL 

5857
04:04:29,688 --> 04:04:31,123
TAKE EVERY SINGLE STEP WE CAN 

5858
04:04:31,123 --> 04:04:32,757
TO STOP IT IN THE FUTURE. 

5859
04:04:32,757 --> 04:04:35,393
NOW THAT'S NOT A CONTROVERSIAL 

5860
04:04:35,393 --> 04:04:36,261
THING TO SAY. 

5861
04:04:36,261 --> 04:04:37,662
IT'S A DIRECT FORCEFUL RESPONSE 

5862
04:04:37,662 --> 04:04:40,098
TO A HOSTILE ACT BY A HOSTILE 

5863
04:04:40,098 --> 04:04:40,398
GOVERNMENT. 

5864
04:04:40,398 --> 04:04:41,933
MANY IN CONGRESS HAVE ASKED FOR 

5865
04:04:41,933 --> 04:04:44,202
THE PRESIDENT TO SAY PRECISELY 

5866
04:04:44,202 --> 04:04:45,604
THOSE WORDS AND SAY THEM IN 

5867
04:04:45,604 --> 04:04:46,738
PUBLIC AND REINFORCE THEM IN 

5868
04:04:46,738 --> 04:04:48,372
PRIVATE, AND ONE OF THE THINGS 

5869
04:04:48,372 --> 04:04:49,274
THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT CAN DO, 

5870
04:04:49,274 --> 04:04:52,043
WHICH IS SLOW TO HAVE DONE 

5871
04:04:52,043 --> 04:04:53,578
UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

5872
04:04:53,578 --> 04:04:56,014
IS FOUR TO FIVE CYBER DEFENSES, 

5873
04:04:56,014 --> 04:04:58,917
GATHER ALL THE STATES OF 

5874
04:04:58,917 --> 04:05:00,786
VARIOUS ELECTION OFFICES, 

5875
04:05:00,786 --> 04:05:02,020
SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE 

5876
04:05:02,020 --> 04:05:03,789
LIKE, AND HELP THEM FORTIFY 

5877
04:05:03,789 --> 04:05:06,224
THEIR DEFENSES AND MAKE IT A 

5878
04:05:06,224 --> 04:05:08,326
PROJECT TO MONITOR AND 

5879
04:05:08,326 --> 04:05:10,061
INTERCEPT AND CALL OUT PUBLICLY 

5880
04:05:10,061 --> 04:05:11,763
ANY FUTURE EFFORTS BY THE 

5881
04:05:11,763 --> 04:05:12,030
RUSSIANS. 

5882
04:05:12,030 --> 04:05:13,665
ALL OF THOSE ARE OPTIONS 

5883
04:05:13,665 --> 04:05:15,500
AVAILABLE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

5884
04:05:15,500 --> 04:05:17,269
AND MANY IN CONGRESS IN BOTH 

5885
04:05:17,269 --> 04:05:18,637
PARTIES ARE AT LEAST HOPEFUL HE 

5886
04:05:18,637 --> 04:05:19,738
WILL MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. 

5887
04:05:19,738 --> 04:05:21,740
>> I WANT TO POINT OUT MAJORS 

5888
04:05:21,740 --> 04:05:23,041
DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL AND 

5889
04:05:23,041 --> 04:05:24,609
FOCUS BECAUSE WE CAN HEAR 

5890
04:05:24,609 --> 04:05:25,710
THERE'S ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT 

5891
04:05:25,710 --> 04:05:27,946
VERY CLOSE TO YOU TALKING VERY 

5892
04:05:27,946 --> 04:05:29,748
LOUD, AND YOU STAYED FOCUSED ON 

5893
04:05:29,748 --> 04:05:29,981
US. 

5894
04:05:29,981 --> 04:05:33,351
>> YEAH, WE APPRECIATE THAT AS 

5895
04:05:33,351 --> 04:05:34,519
ALWAYS, MAJOR, AND MAJOR, WE 

5896
04:05:34,519 --> 04:05:35,720
SHOULD POINT OUT FOR OUR 

5897
04:05:35,720 --> 04:05:36,822
AUDIENCE WITH WITH REGARDS TO 

5898
04:05:36,822 --> 04:05:38,857
HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TREATING 

5899
04:05:38,857 --> 04:05:40,692
THIS MEETING AND TREATING THE 

5900
04:05:40,692 --> 04:05:41,827
RUSSIANS, HE TWEETED EARLIER 

5901
04:05:41,827 --> 04:05:42,828
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA 

5902
04:05:42,828 --> 04:05:44,729
HAS NEVER BEEN WORSE THANKS TO 

5903
04:05:44,729 --> 04:05:49,434
MANY YEARS OF U.S. FOOLISH 

5904
04:05:49,434 --> 04:05:50,769
STUPIDITY, AND NOW THE RUSSIAN 

5905
04:05:50,769 --> 04:05:52,771
FOREIGN MINISTRY OF AFFAIRS 

5906
04:05:52,771 --> 04:05:54,406
THROUGH THEIR TWITTER ACCOUNT 

5907
04:05:54,406 --> 04:05:55,206
RESPONDED WE AGREE. 

5908
04:05:55,206 --> 04:05:59,644
SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT 

5909
04:05:59,644 --> 04:06:00,011
NOW. 

5910
04:06:00,011 --> 04:06:00,544
>> THAT'S REMARKABLE. 

5911
04:06:00,544 --> 04:06:02,814
IT'S JUST REMARKABLE TO THINK 

5912
04:06:02,814 --> 04:06:05,417
OF THAT, AND THAT IS PART OF 

5913
04:06:05,417 --> 04:06:07,018
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SENSE OF 

5914
04:06:07,018 --> 04:06:08,920
HIMSELF, AND SENSE OF HIS 

5915
04:06:08,920 --> 04:06:10,055
PRESIDENCY AS BEING SO 

5916
04:06:10,055 --> 04:06:11,122
DIFFERENT THAN ANY PRESIDENCY 

5917
04:06:11,122 --> 04:06:12,257
THAT CAME BEFORE IT. 

5918
04:06:12,257 --> 04:06:15,560
ON THIS AND SO MANY OTHER 

5919
04:06:15,560 --> 04:06:15,861
ISSUES. 

5920
04:06:15,861 --> 04:06:16,795
IT'S AS IF THE AMERICAN 

5921
04:06:16,795 --> 04:06:17,796
PRESIDENCY DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE 

5922
04:06:17,796 --> 04:06:20,932
HE ARRIVED THERE, OR IF IT DID, 

5923
04:06:20,932 --> 04:06:23,301
IT WAS SO MISDIRECTED AND SO 

5924
04:06:23,301 --> 04:06:24,369
FOOLISH, SO STUPID, THAT IT'S 

5925
04:06:24,369 --> 04:06:26,137
THE CAUSE OF ALL CURRENT 

5926
04:06:26,137 --> 04:06:29,007
PROBLEMS HE'S TRYING TO SORT 

5927
04:06:29,007 --> 04:06:29,207
OUT. 

5928
04:06:29,207 --> 04:06:29,908
NOTHING COULD PLEASE THE 

5929
04:06:29,908 --> 04:06:31,576
RUSSIANS MORE THAN TO HAVE THE 

5930
04:06:31,576 --> 04:06:32,811
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

5931
04:06:32,811 --> 04:06:36,848
AS HE WALKS INTO A PRIVATE 

5932
04:06:36,848 --> 04:06:37,849
MEETING WITH PUTIN, ESSENTIALLY 

5933
04:06:37,849 --> 04:06:38,884
EMBRACE THEIR INTERPRETATION. 

5934
04:06:38,884 --> 04:06:40,584
HEY, IT'S NOT US. 

5935
04:06:40,584 --> 04:06:44,556
IT'S NOT US INVADING UKRAINE 

5936
04:06:44,556 --> 04:06:45,891
AND TAKING OVER CRIMEA, IT'S 

5937
04:06:45,891 --> 04:06:47,092
NOT US BREAKING AGREEMENTS WE 

5938
04:06:47,092 --> 04:06:49,394
HAVE MADE WITH YOU IN SYRIA. 

5939
04:06:49,394 --> 04:06:50,996
IT'S NOT US MEDDLING IN YOUR 

5940
04:06:50,996 --> 04:06:52,464
ELECTIONS, PAST AND POSSIBLY 

5941
04:06:52,464 --> 04:06:53,465
PRESENT. 

5942
04:06:53,465 --> 04:06:56,634
IT'S NOT US, AS YOU MENTIONED, 

5943
04:06:56,634 --> 04:06:58,570
VLAD, POISONING A BRITISH 

5944
04:06:58,570 --> 04:06:59,437
CITIZEN IN BRITAIN. 

5945
04:06:59,437 --> 04:07:00,505
NONE OF THOSE THINGS HAVE 

5946
04:07:00,505 --> 04:07:02,940
HARMED THE U.S. RELATIONSHIP. 

5947
04:07:02,940 --> 04:07:05,010
IT'S THOSE PAST AMERICAN 

5948
04:07:05,010 --> 04:07:05,310
PRESIDENTS. 

5949
04:07:05,310 --> 04:07:06,511
FOR THAT, VLADIMIR PUTIN WOULD 

5950
04:07:06,511 --> 04:07:11,549
ALMOST, I THINK, WANT TO EXTEND 

5951
04:07:11,549 --> 04:07:12,984
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP A 

5952
04:07:12,984 --> 04:07:13,885
METAPHORICAL AND LITERAL 

5953
04:07:13,885 --> 04:07:16,488
BOUQUET OF THANKS, BECAUSE IT 

5954
04:07:16,488 --> 04:07:17,622
COULDN'T SET A BETTER PREDICATE 

5955
04:07:17,622 --> 04:07:18,823
FOR THEIR CONVERSATION. 

5956
04:07:18,823 --> 04:07:21,159
IT'S MORE THAN HALFWAY TO WHAT 

5957
04:07:21,159 --> 04:07:22,160
THE RUSSIANS ALREADY BELIEVE 

5958
04:07:22,160 --> 04:07:24,162
ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THIS 

5959
04:07:24,162 --> 04:07:24,495
RELATIONSHIP. 

5960
04:07:24,495 --> 04:07:25,229
IT'S PRETTY AMAZING. 

5961
04:07:25,229 --> 04:07:27,132
>> MAJOR GARRETT IN HELSINKI 

5962
04:07:27,132 --> 04:07:31,269
FOR US, MAJOR, THANK YOU VERY 

5963
04:07:31,269 --> 04:07:33,338
MUCH. 

5964
04:07:33,338 --> 04:07:35,673
>> YOU GOT IT. 

5965
04:07:35,673 --> 04:07:40,111
>>> ALEX CLEMENTE US, WRITE 

5966
04:07:40,111 --> 04:07:41,846
FORKER SIGNAL, ALEX, THE 

5967
04:07:41,846 --> 04:07:43,915
SIGNIFICANCE OF PRESIDENT PUTIN 

5968
04:07:43,915 --> 04:07:44,916
FORMALLY SITTING DOWN WITH 

5969
04:07:44,916 --> 04:07:48,520
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE WAKE OF 

5970
04:07:48,520 --> 04:07:49,854
ALL THAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE 

5971
04:07:49,854 --> 04:07:50,956
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BETWEEN 

5972
04:07:50,956 --> 04:07:52,090
THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA, 

5973
04:07:52,090 --> 04:07:53,658
AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT 

5974
04:07:53,658 --> 04:07:55,026
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

5975
04:07:55,026 --> 04:07:56,061
STATES TWEETED THAT THE 

5976
04:07:56,061 --> 04:07:58,930
TENSIONS AND THE CHALLENGES AND 

5977
04:07:58,930 --> 04:07:59,563
THE PROBLEMS, THE DIFFICULTIES 

5978
04:07:59,563 --> 04:08:00,565
THAT EXIST BETWEEN THE UNITED 

5979
04:08:00,565 --> 04:08:03,668
STATES AND RUSSIA ARE DUE TO 

5980
04:08:03,668 --> 04:08:05,470
U.S. FOOLISHNESS AND STUPIDITY. 

5981
04:08:05,470 --> 04:08:06,304
SOMETHING THAT THE RUSSIAN 

5982
04:08:06,304 --> 04:08:07,138
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 

5983
04:08:07,138 --> 04:08:07,605
AGREED WITH. 

5984
04:08:07,605 --> 04:08:09,374
>> WELL, LOOK, I THINK THE FACT 

5985
04:08:09,374 --> 04:08:11,443
THAT THEY'RE SITTING DOWN IS ON 

5986
04:08:11,443 --> 04:08:14,980
ITS FACE A WIN FOR PUTIN, 

5987
04:08:14,980 --> 04:08:15,714
RIGHT. 

5988
04:08:15,714 --> 04:08:20,618
IN A NUMBER OF RESPECTS. 

5989
04:08:20,618 --> 04:08:22,120
ONE, IT GIVES PUTIN THE ABILITY 

5990
04:08:22,120 --> 04:08:23,621
TO SAY WE HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF 

5991
04:08:23,621 --> 04:08:25,290
ALL THESE THINGS, AND THE U.S. 

5992
04:08:25,290 --> 04:08:26,491
PRESIDENT IS NOT ONLY WILLING 

5993
04:08:26,491 --> 04:08:29,227
TO SIT DOWN WITH US BUT ALSO TO 

5994
04:08:29,227 --> 04:08:31,129
ACCEPT THE RUSSIAN NARRATIVE 

5995
04:08:31,129 --> 04:08:33,064
THAT THE DETERIORATION IN 

5996
04:08:33,064 --> 04:08:34,899
RELATIONS, WHICH IS AN 

5997
04:08:34,899 --> 04:08:35,567
OBSERVABLE DETERIORATION IN 

5998
04:08:35,567 --> 04:08:38,837
NATIONS IS IN FACT THE U.S.' 

5999
04:08:38,837 --> 04:08:40,371
FAULT AND NOT RUSSIA'S FAULT. 

6000
04:08:40,371 --> 04:08:41,272
TRUMP HAS SAID REPEATEDLY 

6001
04:08:41,272 --> 04:08:43,575
HAVING A GOOD RELATIONSHIP IS A 

6002
04:08:43,575 --> 04:08:44,843
GOOD IDEA, HAVING A GOOD 

6003
04:08:44,843 --> 04:08:46,811
RELATIONSHIP IS A GOAL OF HIS. 

6004
04:08:46,811 --> 04:08:48,513
HE'S RIGHT, HAVING A GOOD 

6005
04:08:48,513 --> 04:08:51,750
RELATIONSHIP IS IN PRINCIPLE A 

6006
04:08:51,750 --> 04:08:53,518
GOOD THING. 

6007
04:08:53,518 --> 04:08:58,256
WHAT IS NOT IN THE 

6008
04:08:58,256 --> 04:09:00,358
CONVERSATION, IT IS A TOOL 

6009
04:09:00,358 --> 04:09:01,493
EFFECT OTHER OUTCOMES THAT YOU 

6010
04:09:01,493 --> 04:09:03,328
WANT, AND IT'S NOT EXACTLY 

6011
04:09:03,328 --> 04:09:05,497
CLEAR WHAT TRUMP IS GOING INTO 

6012
04:09:05,497 --> 04:09:07,098
THE MEETING POTENTIALLY SEEKING 

6013
04:09:07,098 --> 04:09:07,465
FROM PUTIN. 

6014
04:09:07,465 --> 04:09:09,934
WE'RE AWARE OF WHAT PUTIN IS 

6015
04:09:09,934 --> 04:09:13,505
SEEKING FROM TRUMP, THE GREEN 

6016
04:09:13,505 --> 04:09:20,578
LIGHT, THE LETBY GONES BE. 

6017
04:09:20,578 --> 04:09:22,347
>> IS A GOOD RELATIONSHIP EVEN 

6018
04:09:22,347 --> 04:09:23,848
REALISTIC WHEN WE'RE TALKING 

6019
04:09:23,848 --> 04:09:25,016
ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN? 

6020
04:09:25,016 --> 04:09:27,285
>> IT'S INTERESTING, ON ONE 

6021
04:09:27,285 --> 04:09:28,520
LEVEL THERE ARE CERTAIN 

6022
04:09:28,520 --> 04:09:29,421
DIVERGENCES BETWEEN WHAT RUSSIA 

6023
04:09:29,421 --> 04:09:31,923
WANTS AND WHAT THE U.S. WANTS. 

6024
04:09:31,923 --> 04:09:33,925
RUSSIA WANTS TO BE TREATED AS A 

6025
04:09:33,925 --> 04:09:36,227
GREAT POWER IN A WORLD IN WHICH 

6026
04:09:36,227 --> 04:09:38,897
ITS ACTUAL ECONOMIC AND 

6027
04:09:38,897 --> 04:09:42,300
MILITARY POWER IS NOT REALLY UP 

6028
04:09:42,300 --> 04:09:44,468
TO SNUFF. 

6029
04:09:44,468 --> 04:09:47,238
RUSSIA WANTS TO SEE A WORLD IN 

6030
04:09:47,238 --> 04:09:48,506
WHICH U.S. MORAL LEADERSHIP AND 

6031
04:09:48,506 --> 04:09:49,874
MULTILATERAL LEADERSHIP WHERE 

6032
04:09:49,874 --> 04:09:51,809
THERE'S A WAY. 

6033
04:09:51,809 --> 04:09:53,011
TRADITIONALLY THE U.S. HAS NOT 

6034
04:09:53,011 --> 04:09:54,779
WANTED THAT TO HAPPEN. 

6035
04:09:54,779 --> 04:09:56,114
NOW YOU HAVE TWO LEADERS, PUTIN 

6036
04:09:56,114 --> 04:09:58,750
AND TRUMP WHO HAVE A SIMILAR 

6037
04:09:58,750 --> 04:10:02,320
WORLD VIEW, NEITHER OF THEM 

6038
04:10:02,320 --> 04:10:04,622
SEES A PARTICULAR VALUE IN 

6039
04:10:04,622 --> 04:10:04,822
NATO. 

6040
04:10:04,822 --> 04:10:05,122
BOTH VIEW. 

6041
04:10:05,122 --> 04:10:06,558
EU AS A CHALLENGE, RATHER THAN 

6042
04:10:06,558 --> 04:10:07,024
AN OPPORTUNITY. 

6043
04:10:07,024 --> 04:10:10,562
AND NEITHER OF THEM WISHES TO 

6044
04:10:10,562 --> 04:10:13,832
SEE THE U.S. AS KIND OF 

6045
04:10:13,832 --> 04:10:16,468
EXERTING MORAL LEADERSHIP OVER 

6046
04:10:16,468 --> 04:10:17,635
A MULTILATERAL STRUCTURE. 

6047
04:10:17,635 --> 04:10:18,670
BOTH COME FROM DIFFERENT ORIGIN 

6048
04:10:18,670 --> 04:10:20,071
POINTS BUT THE FACT IS THEY 

6049
04:10:20,071 --> 04:10:20,938
HAPPEN TO OVERLAP. 

6050
04:10:20,938 --> 04:10:21,873
THAT'S THE BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN 

6051
04:10:21,873 --> 04:10:23,974
YOU LOOK AT THE U.S. SIDE OF 

6052
04:10:23,974 --> 04:10:24,642
THE RELATIONSHIP. 

6053
04:10:24,642 --> 04:10:25,977
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS IN MANY 

6054
04:10:25,977 --> 04:10:28,213
INTERVIEWS SUGGESTED THAT MUCH 

6055
04:10:28,213 --> 04:10:29,581
OF THESE PROBLEMS, IF WE'RE TO 

6056
04:10:29,581 --> 04:10:36,955
PARSE WHAT HE PUT ON TWITTER 

6057
04:10:36,955 --> 04:10:39,624
ABOUT U.S. FOOLISHNESS AND 

6058
04:10:39,624 --> 04:10:41,059
STUPIDITY, IT MIGHT BE SUGGESTS 

6059
04:10:41,059 --> 04:10:41,292
OBAMA. 

6060
04:10:41,292 --> 04:10:43,228
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THE 

6061
04:10:43,228 --> 04:10:44,195
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND BUSH 

6062
04:10:44,195 --> 04:10:45,363
ADMINISTRATION COULD HAVE DONE 

6063
04:10:45,363 --> 04:10:45,696
DIFFERENTLY. 

6064
04:10:45,696 --> 04:10:47,532
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WHEN 

6065
04:10:47,532 --> 04:10:48,700
THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO INDICATE 

6066
04:10:48,700 --> 04:10:49,968
THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS THE 

6067
04:10:49,968 --> 04:10:52,203
GOAL IN AND OF ITSELF AS YOU 

6068
04:10:52,203 --> 04:10:53,438
SAID, WHEN YOU DISREGARD ALL 

6069
04:10:53,438 --> 04:10:54,873
THE THINGS THAT RUSSIA HAS 

6070
04:10:54,873 --> 04:10:56,674
DONE, I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T EVEN 

6071
04:10:56,674 --> 04:10:58,409
TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT 

6072
04:10:58,409 --> 04:11:00,478
RUSSIA SHOT DOWN A CIVILIAN 

6073
04:11:00,478 --> 04:11:04,516
AIRLINER WITH 300 SOULS ON 

6074
04:11:04,516 --> 04:11:05,382
BOARD OVER UKRAINE, MALAYSIAN 

6075
04:11:05,382 --> 04:11:06,584
AIRLINES 17. 

6076
04:11:06,584 --> 04:11:08,019
>> OR THEY SUPPLIED THE MISSILE 

6077
04:11:08,019 --> 04:11:12,390
THAT WAS USED TO SHOOT THAT 

6078
04:11:12,390 --> 04:11:13,024
AIRCRAFT DOWN. 

6079
04:11:13,024 --> 04:11:15,026
>> THAT THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE 

6080
04:11:15,026 --> 04:11:16,728
POISONED IN BRITAIN, THERE IS 

6081
04:11:16,728 --> 04:11:17,362
THIS ANNEXATION. 

6082
04:11:17,362 --> 04:11:18,863
THERE'S A MILLION THINGS WE CAN 

6083
04:11:18,863 --> 04:11:19,263
TALK ABOUT. 

6084
04:11:19,263 --> 04:11:21,132
IS IT ENOUGH THAT WE HAVE THIS 

6085
04:11:21,132 --> 04:11:21,665
GOOD RELATIONSHIP. 

6086
04:11:21,665 --> 04:11:23,168
IS THAT ENOUGH SO THAT PUTIN 

6087
04:11:23,168 --> 04:11:25,370
SAYS I'M NOT GOING TO DO THOSE 

6088
04:11:25,370 --> 04:11:25,936
THINGS AGAIN? 

6089
04:11:25,936 --> 04:11:28,940
>> WELL, LOOK, I MEAN, IF THESE 

6090
04:11:28,940 --> 04:11:30,341
THINGS HAVE HAPPENED, AND HE 

6091
04:11:30,341 --> 04:11:31,643
STILL GETS TO ENJOY A GOOD 

6092
04:11:31,643 --> 04:11:32,477
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. 

6093
04:11:32,477 --> 04:11:38,916
>> THEN IT'S A WIN FOR HIM. 

6094
04:11:38,916 --> 04:11:39,483
>> RIGHT. 

6095
04:11:39,483 --> 04:11:39,784
YEAH. 

6096
04:11:39,784 --> 04:11:43,655
>> IT'S HARD FOR BY GONES TO BE 

6097
04:11:43,655 --> 04:11:45,490
BY GONES, THEY'RE IN 

6098
04:11:45,490 --> 04:11:46,023
POSSESSIONOVER CRIMEA. 

6099
04:11:46,023 --> 04:11:47,926
THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO MEDDLE 

6100
04:11:47,926 --> 04:11:49,527
IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION RIGHT 

6101
04:11:49,527 --> 04:11:50,195
NOW. 

6102
04:11:50,195 --> 04:11:52,130
>> WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS 

6103
04:11:52,130 --> 04:11:53,197
THESE ARE BOTH REVISIONIST 

6104
04:11:53,197 --> 04:11:55,700
LEADERS IN THEIR OWN WAY. 

6105
04:11:55,700 --> 04:11:57,435
PUTIN WANTS TO REVISE THE POST 

6106
04:11:57,435 --> 04:12:00,438
COLD WAR ORDER IN WHICH RUSSIA 

6107
04:12:00,438 --> 04:12:01,940
WAS WEAK AND HUMILIATED AND NO 

6108
04:12:01,940 --> 04:12:03,741
ONE PAID ATTENTION TO RUSSIA. 

6109
04:12:03,741 --> 04:12:04,776
HIS BEEF IS WITH THE 

6110
04:12:04,776 --> 04:12:05,610
INTERNATIONAL ESTABLISHMENT, IF 

6111
04:12:05,610 --> 04:12:07,645
YOU WILL, AND TRUMP'S BIG BEEF 

6112
04:12:07,645 --> 04:12:09,280
IS WITH THE AMERICAN POLITICAL 

6113
04:12:09,280 --> 04:12:09,647
ESTABLISHMENT. 

6114
04:12:09,647 --> 04:12:10,982
RIGHT, SO THEY BOTH COME AT IT 

6115
04:12:10,982 --> 04:12:13,952
FROM THIS KIND OF OUTSIDER, 

6116
04:12:13,952 --> 04:12:14,852
SORT OF ISOLATED REVISIONIST 

6117
04:12:14,852 --> 04:12:15,987
PERSPECTIVE, AND I THINK THEY 

6118
04:12:15,987 --> 04:12:17,922
HAVE SOME KIND OF COMMON GROUND 

6119
04:12:17,922 --> 04:12:18,222
ON THAT. 

6120
04:12:18,222 --> 04:12:21,593
BUT AS YOU SAY, LOOK, I MEAN, 

6121
04:12:21,593 --> 04:12:23,127
IF THE U.S. PRESIDENT IS GOING 

6122
04:12:23,127 --> 04:12:25,163
TO HOLD RUSSIA TO ACCOUNT FOR 

6123
04:12:25,163 --> 04:12:27,298
THESE THINGS, THERE HAS TO BE A 

6124
04:12:27,298 --> 04:12:28,666
CLEAR MESSAGE, RIGHT? 

6125
04:12:28,666 --> 04:12:30,001
I MEAN, PUTIN GOES INTO THIS 

6126
04:12:30,001 --> 04:12:31,502
AND IF THERE'S NO PUSH BACK 

6127
04:12:31,502 --> 04:12:33,071
FROM TRUMP, IF HE DOESN'T SAY, 

6128
04:12:33,071 --> 04:12:34,806
HEY, YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULDN'T 

6129
04:12:34,806 --> 04:12:36,407
HAVE BEEN DOING THESE THINGS, 

6130
04:12:36,407 --> 04:12:37,842
AND NOT ONLY YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE 

6131
04:12:37,842 --> 04:12:39,544
DOING THESE THINGS, BUT HERE 

6132
04:12:39,544 --> 04:12:41,879
ARE THE COSTS IT YOU TRY TO DO 

6133
04:12:41,879 --> 04:12:43,448
IT AGAIN, YOU DON'T SEE THE 

6134
04:12:43,448 --> 04:12:45,149
MESSAGE COMING FROM TRUMP. 

6135
04:12:45,149 --> 04:12:46,417
>> TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT THE 

6136
04:12:46,417 --> 04:12:47,585
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, WHAT 

6137
04:12:47,585 --> 04:12:49,087
WOULD A WIN LOOK LIKE FOR THE 

6138
04:12:49,087 --> 04:12:50,488
UNITED STATES IF WE ARE TALKING 

6139
04:12:50,488 --> 04:12:51,656
ABOUT WINS THE WAY THE 

6140
04:12:51,656 --> 04:12:53,791
PRESIDENT LIKES TO TALK ABOUT 

6141
04:12:53,791 --> 04:12:54,792
THEM, SOMEBODY WINS, SOMEBODY 

6142
04:12:54,792 --> 04:12:59,497
LOSES, WHAT WOULD A WIN LOOK 

6143
04:12:59,497 --> 04:13:00,531
LIKE, THE SUMMIT IS OVER. 

6144
04:13:00,531 --> 04:13:02,367
>> FOR THE UNITED STATES OR 

6145
04:13:02,367 --> 04:13:03,601
TRUMP HIMSELF, I THINK THOSE 

6146
04:13:03,601 --> 04:13:04,568
ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. 

6147
04:13:04,568 --> 04:13:05,636
>> GIVE ME BOTH. 

6148
04:13:05,636 --> 04:13:08,039
>> WELL, LOOK, I MEAN, FROM 

6149
04:13:08,039 --> 04:13:09,974
TRUMP'S PERSPECTIVE HE CAN COME 

6150
04:13:09,974 --> 04:13:16,180
OUT OF IT SAYING, LOOK, I BROKE 

6151
04:13:16,180 --> 04:13:21,786
THE TABOOS, I ALONE WAS ABLE TO 

6152
04:13:21,786 --> 04:13:23,721
MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH. 

6153
04:13:23,721 --> 04:13:25,423
THIS IS THE THIRD PRESIDENT 

6154
04:13:25,423 --> 04:13:27,025
THAT HAS TRIED TO RESET 

6155
04:13:27,025 --> 04:13:28,058
RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. 

6156
04:13:28,058 --> 04:13:31,095
WE'LL SEE IF TRUMP IS MORE 

6157
04:13:31,095 --> 04:13:32,230
SUCCESSFUL THAN TWO 

6158
04:13:32,230 --> 04:13:34,265
PREDECESSORS, A REAL WIN FROM 

6159
04:13:34,265 --> 04:13:36,000
THE U.S. KIND OF BROADER 

6160
04:13:36,000 --> 04:13:36,734
NATIONAL INTEREST PERSPECTIVE, 

6161
04:13:36,734 --> 04:13:37,668
I THINK THERE'S RELATIVELY 

6162
04:13:37,668 --> 04:13:41,372
LITTLE SCOPE FOR THAT. 

6163
04:13:41,372 --> 04:13:45,576
IF YOU GOT PROGRESS ON SAY A 

6164
04:13:45,576 --> 04:13:47,111
NEW ARMS CONTROL, RIGHT, THERE 

6165
04:13:47,111 --> 04:13:48,279
ARE TWO TREATIES THAT ARE 

6166
04:13:48,279 --> 04:13:49,514
CURRENTLY PROBLEMS WITH THE 

6167
04:13:49,514 --> 04:13:50,915
TREATIES, ONE IS THE START 

6168
04:13:50,915 --> 04:13:53,985
TREATY WHICH NEEDS TO BE 

6169
04:13:53,985 --> 04:13:56,487
RENEWED IN 2021. 

6170
04:13:56,487 --> 04:13:57,354
ANOTHER IS AN INTERMEDIATE 

6171
04:13:57,354 --> 04:13:59,390
FORCES TREATY THAT THE RUSSIANS 

6172
04:13:59,390 --> 04:14:00,758
HAVE BEEN VIOLATED FOR SEVERAL 

6173
04:14:00,758 --> 04:14:00,991
YEARS. 

6174
04:14:00,991 --> 04:14:02,160
IF YOU CAN GET PROGRESS, THAT 

6175
04:14:02,160 --> 04:14:03,394
WOULD BE A WIN. 

6176
04:14:03,394 --> 04:14:05,129
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET PUTIN 

6177
04:14:05,129 --> 04:14:06,664
TO SAY HEY, I'M SORRY ABOUT 

6178
04:14:06,664 --> 04:14:08,166
MEDDLING IN THE ELECTIONS AND 

6179
04:14:08,166 --> 04:14:09,867
I'M WILLING TO COME CLEAN ABOUT 

6180
04:14:09,867 --> 04:14:10,033
IT. 

6181
04:14:10,033 --> 04:14:11,636
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET PUTIN 

6182
04:14:11,636 --> 04:14:13,338
TO FOLD ON UKRAINE AND SAY YOU 

6183
04:14:13,338 --> 04:14:15,807
CAN HAVE IT, IF NATO AND THE EU 

6184
04:14:15,807 --> 04:14:18,176
WANT TO MAKE A MEMBER, GO 

6185
04:14:18,176 --> 04:14:18,409
AHEAD. 

6186
04:14:18,409 --> 04:14:19,510
I THINK THE ACTUAL SCOPE FOR 

6187
04:14:19,510 --> 04:14:21,245
THE U.S. TO HAVE A BIG WIN OUT 

6188
04:14:21,245 --> 04:14:25,883
OF THIS SUMMIT IS ACTUALLY 

6189
04:14:25,883 --> 04:14:26,450
PRETTY SMALL. 

6190
04:14:26,450 --> 04:14:27,752
>> MUCH ADIEU ABOUT NOTHING IF 

6191
04:14:27,752 --> 04:14:28,953
NOTHING CONCRETE IS LIKELY TO 

6192
04:14:28,953 --> 04:14:29,687
COME OUT OF THIS. 

6193
04:14:29,687 --> 04:14:32,923
>> WE GO BACK TO THE SYMBOLISM, 

6194
04:14:32,923 --> 04:14:34,192
WHO WINS MOST FROM THE 

6195
04:14:34,192 --> 04:14:34,492
SYMBOLISM. 

6196
04:14:34,492 --> 04:14:35,693
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY EXPECTED 

6197
04:14:35,693 --> 04:14:36,761
SERIOUS OR SUBSTANTIATIVE, 

6198
04:14:36,761 --> 04:14:38,596
LEAST OF ALL, PRESIDENT TRUMP, 

6199
04:14:38,596 --> 04:14:39,864
HE TRIED TO SET LOW 

6200
04:14:39,864 --> 04:14:41,232
EXPECTATIONS, HE FRONT RAN THE 

6201
04:14:41,232 --> 04:14:42,900
IDEA THAT IF THE SUMMIT WAS A 

6202
04:14:42,900 --> 04:14:44,869
BUST, IT WOULD BE BECAUSE THE 

6203
04:14:44,869 --> 04:14:46,437
MEDIA WAS NEVER GIVING HIM A 

6204
04:14:46,437 --> 04:14:46,837
FAIR SHAKE. 

6205
04:14:46,837 --> 04:14:48,373
THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT, THE 

6206
04:14:48,373 --> 04:14:50,375
SUBSTANCE WAS NEVER WHAT THIS 

6207
04:14:50,375 --> 04:14:50,774
WAS ABOUT. 

6208
04:14:50,774 --> 04:14:53,378
IT'S MAINLY ABOUT SYMBOLISM AND 

6209
04:14:53,378 --> 04:14:59,250
IT'S A WIN MORE FOR PUTIN THAN 

6210
04:14:59,250 --> 04:14:59,483
TRUMP. 

6211
04:14:59,483 --> 04:15:02,553
>> IT'S INTERESTING, THE FACT 

6212
04:15:02,553 --> 04:15:05,123
THAT WE ARE GRASPING AT WHAT A 

6213
04:15:05,123 --> 04:15:06,657
WIN POLITICALLY BEGS THE 

6214
04:15:06,657 --> 04:15:07,759
QUESTION, OTHER THAN THE 

6215
04:15:07,759 --> 04:15:08,926
SYMBOLISM SITTING DOWN WITH THE 

6216
04:15:08,926 --> 04:15:10,061
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT, WHICH IS A 

6217
04:15:10,061 --> 04:15:11,763
GOOD THING IF YOU CAN GET FACE 

6218
04:15:11,763 --> 04:15:12,897
TO FACE BEFORE THE RUSSIAN 

6219
04:15:12,897 --> 04:15:14,599
PRESIDENT, I GUESS THAT'S A 

6220
04:15:14,599 --> 04:15:17,368
GOOD THING, THEN WHY HOLD IT 

6221
04:15:17,368 --> 04:15:19,203
NOW, WHY EVEN DO IT AT ALL, IF 

6222
04:15:19,203 --> 04:15:20,638
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PRESS ON 

6223
04:15:20,638 --> 04:15:22,540
THE THINGS THAT MATTER TO THE 

6224
04:15:22,540 --> 04:15:23,640
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 

6225
04:15:23,640 --> 04:15:25,476
TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED 

6226
04:15:25,476 --> 04:15:28,346
STATES, TO OUR ALLIES AND OUR 

6227
04:15:28,346 --> 04:15:29,647
PARTNERS AROUND THE WORLD WHEN 

6228
04:15:29,647 --> 04:15:31,182
YOU HAVE THE GERMAN FOREIGN 

6229
04:15:31,182 --> 04:15:32,784
MINISTER SUGGESTING THAT THEY 

6230
04:15:32,784 --> 04:15:34,519
CAN NO LONGER RELY ON THE WHITE 

6231
04:15:34,519 --> 04:15:35,987
HOUSE, WHY HOLD THIS MEETING 

6232
04:15:35,987 --> 04:15:36,521
NOW AT ALL? 

6233
04:15:36,521 --> 04:15:38,022
>> I JUST DON'T THINK THOSE ARE 

6234
04:15:38,022 --> 04:15:39,457
THE CALCULATIONS THAT GO 

6235
04:15:39,457 --> 04:15:43,995
THROUGH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HEAD. 

6236
04:15:43,995 --> 04:15:45,430
I THINK IT'S MORE ABOUT 

6237
04:15:45,430 --> 04:15:46,764
CREATING AN AURA AND MYSTIQUE 

6238
04:15:46,764 --> 04:15:47,665
AROUND HIS PRESIDENCY, HIS 

6239
04:15:47,665 --> 04:15:49,300
ABILITY TO SIT DOWN WITH AND 

6240
04:15:49,300 --> 04:15:50,802
GET, YOU KNOW, GET A 

6241
04:15:50,802 --> 04:15:52,036
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GUYS THAT 

6242
04:15:52,036 --> 04:15:54,672
NO ONE ELSE IS WILLING TO TALK 

6243
04:15:54,672 --> 04:15:54,838
TO. 

6244
04:15:54,838 --> 04:15:56,174
HE'S WILLING TO TALK TO TOUGH 

6245
04:15:56,174 --> 04:15:57,375
NASTY GUYS AND FORM A 

6246
04:15:57,375 --> 04:15:58,443
RELATIONSHIP AND BE ABLE TO 

6247
04:15:58,443 --> 04:16:00,344
DEAL WITH THEM IN A WAY THAT 

6248
04:16:00,344 --> 04:16:00,844
OTHERS COULDN'T. 

6249
04:16:00,844 --> 04:16:03,181
I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT 

6250
04:16:03,181 --> 04:16:04,081
FROM TRUMP'S PERSPECTIVE. 

6251
04:16:04,081 --> 04:16:06,584
I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT A 

6252
04:16:06,584 --> 04:16:07,318
CALCULATED APPROACH TO 

6253
04:16:07,318 --> 04:16:07,952
ADVANCING NATIONAL INTEREST. 

6254
04:16:07,952 --> 04:16:12,923
>> AND IT'S INTERESTING, TOO, I 

6255
04:16:12,923 --> 04:16:15,993
THINK THAT FOREIGN POLICY PLAYS 

6256
04:16:15,993 --> 04:16:17,862
OUT ON THE WORLD STAGE, BUT IT 

6257
04:16:17,862 --> 04:16:19,964
DOESN'T ALWAYS MATTER THAT MUCH 

6258
04:16:19,964 --> 04:16:20,297
BACK HOME. 

6259
04:16:20,297 --> 04:16:22,333
I THINK ABOUT GEORGE H. W. BUSH 

6260
04:16:22,333 --> 04:16:26,070
WINNING THE FIRST GULF WAR AND 

6261
04:16:26,070 --> 04:16:27,672
LOSING THE ELECTION TO BILL 

6262
04:16:27,672 --> 04:16:27,939
CLINTON. 

6263
04:16:27,939 --> 04:16:28,973
I REMEMBER BEING IN COLLEGE AT 

6264
04:16:28,973 --> 04:16:30,274
THE TIME OR RIGHT OUT OF 

6265
04:16:30,274 --> 04:16:32,343
COLLEGE AND I REMEMBER THINKING 

6266
04:16:32,343 --> 04:16:33,811
TO MYSELF, THERE'S NO WAY BUSH 

6267
04:16:33,811 --> 04:16:35,179
LOSES TO THE GOVERNOROF 

6268
04:16:35,179 --> 04:16:36,581
ARKANSAS AND YET HE DID BECAUSE 

6269
04:16:36,581 --> 04:16:39,016
AMERICANS WERE VERY HAPPY WITH 

6270
04:16:39,016 --> 04:16:40,918
THE WIN, BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY 

6271
04:16:40,918 --> 04:16:42,587
TRANSLATOR ANY KIND OF 

6272
04:16:42,587 --> 04:16:43,588
SIGNIFICANT VICTORY BACK HOME 

6273
04:16:43,588 --> 04:16:44,956
DURING THE ELECTIONS AND I JUST 

6274
04:16:44,956 --> 04:16:46,423
SOMETIMES WONDER IF A LOT OF 

6275
04:16:46,423 --> 04:16:48,993
THIS STUFF, IT LOOKS GREAT ON 

6276
04:16:48,993 --> 04:16:49,994
TRUMP'S RESUME, BUT DOESN'T 

6277
04:16:49,994 --> 04:16:52,730
ACTUALLY CHANGE ANYTHING HERE. 

6278
04:16:52,730 --> 04:16:53,931
>> I AGREE WITH YOU. 

6279
04:16:53,931 --> 04:16:54,932
I DON'T THINK THESE FOREIGN 

6280
04:16:54,932 --> 04:16:56,601
POLICY THINGS HAVE MUCH OF AN 

6281
04:16:56,601 --> 04:16:56,834
EFFECT. 

6282
04:16:56,834 --> 04:17:01,706
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT TRUMP 

6283
04:17:01,706 --> 04:17:02,940
DOES ON TRADE OR IMMIGRATION, 

6284
04:17:02,940 --> 04:17:05,309
THAT'S A WIN FOR SURE. 

6285
04:17:05,309 --> 04:17:06,410
THIS IS MORE ABOUT HIS 

6286
04:17:06,410 --> 04:17:09,881
PERCEPTION OF HIMSELF AS THIS 

6287
04:17:09,881 --> 04:17:11,382
KIND OF REVISIONIST NEW KIND OF 

6288
04:17:11,382 --> 04:17:12,917
PRESIDENT WHO'S DOING THINGS 

6289
04:17:12,917 --> 04:17:14,785
THAT, YOU KNOW, BOLDLY GOING 

6290
04:17:14,785 --> 04:17:16,954
WHERE NO ONE ELSE WOULD GO 

6291
04:17:16,954 --> 04:17:18,122
BEFORE AND OFTEN WITH LESS 

6292
04:17:18,122 --> 04:17:19,690
PREPARATION THAN HE MIGHT HAVE. 

6293
04:17:19,690 --> 04:17:21,292
>> YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE LIVE 

6294
04:17:21,292 --> 04:17:22,527
PICTURE WHERE WE EXPECT THE 

6295
04:17:22,527 --> 04:17:23,594
JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE AND IT 

6296
04:17:23,594 --> 04:17:24,962
WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT 

6297
04:17:24,962 --> 04:17:25,730
COMES OUT OF THAT. 

6298
04:17:25,730 --> 04:17:27,498
>> DO WE HAVE ANY DETAILS ABOUT 

6299
04:17:27,498 --> 04:17:28,966
THAT, IF THEY'RE TAKING 

6300
04:17:28,966 --> 04:17:30,334
QUESTIONS OR BRIEF STATEMENTS? 

6301
04:17:30,334 --> 04:17:32,970
>> LET'S ASK OUR CONTROL ROOM? 

6302
04:17:32,970 --> 04:17:36,908
GUYS ARE WE A HEARING THEY'RE 

6303
04:17:36,908 --> 04:17:37,908
GOING TO TAKE QUESTIONS? 

6304
04:17:37,908 --> 04:17:38,542
>> HAVEN'T HEARD YET. 

6305
04:17:38,542 --> 04:17:43,114
>> IT WILL BE INTERESTING. 

6306
04:17:43,114 --> 04:17:44,048
MY GUESS IS NOT. 

6307
04:17:44,048 --> 04:17:44,648
>> PROBABLY NOT. 

6308
04:17:44,648 --> 04:17:46,617
>> BUT THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO 

6309
04:17:46,617 --> 04:17:46,817
TALK. 

6310
04:17:46,817 --> 04:17:48,052
BOTH PRESIDENTS LIKE TO TALK. 

6311
04:17:48,052 --> 04:17:49,921
VLADIMIR PUTIN, WHAT IS HE, 

6312
04:17:49,921 --> 04:17:51,455
IT'S A WEEKLY THING. 

6313
04:17:51,455 --> 04:17:54,191
>> IT'S A YEARLY THING WHERE HE 

6314
04:17:54,191 --> 04:17:55,960
DOES A CALL IN SHOW WITH THE 

6315
04:17:55,960 --> 04:17:57,094
ENTIRE, ALL OF RUSSIA. 

6316
04:17:57,094 --> 04:17:59,630
HE SITS THERE FOR 3, 4 HOURS, A 

6317
04:17:59,630 --> 04:18:01,264
MARATHON THING, PEOPLE CALL IN. 

6318
04:18:01,264 --> 04:18:02,532
>> HE ENJOYS IT. 

6319
04:18:02,532 --> 04:18:05,503
HE'S VERY GOOD AT IT. 

6320
04:18:05,503 --> 04:18:08,539
HE HAS A REAL, I COVERED RUSSIA 

6321
04:18:08,539 --> 04:18:10,340
IF MANY YEARS. 

6322
04:18:10,340 --> 04:18:12,610
HE HAS A REAL CHARISMA WITH 

6323
04:18:12,610 --> 04:18:13,010
PEOPLE. 

6324
04:18:13,010 --> 04:18:15,646
IT'S HIGHLY STAGED, EVERYTHING 

6325
04:18:15,646 --> 04:18:17,214
FROM A FARMER IN SIBERIA, HIS 

6326
04:18:17,214 --> 04:18:23,254
SEEDS WEREN'T DELIVERED ON 

6327
04:18:23,254 --> 04:18:23,454
TIME. 

6328
04:18:23,454 --> 04:18:24,922
TRUMP SAYS I WILL COME DELIVER 

6329
04:18:24,922 --> 04:18:26,791
THE SEEDS FOR YOU. 

6330
04:18:26,791 --> 04:18:27,791
>> PUTIN. 

6331
04:18:27,791 --> 04:18:29,026
>> INDICT ME, VLAD, INDICT ME. 

6332
04:18:29,026 --> 04:18:30,895
>> BOTH PRESIDENTS ARE VERY 

6333
04:18:30,895 --> 04:18:31,729
GOOD WITH THE MEDIA. 

6334
04:18:31,729 --> 04:18:33,364
>> THEY HAVE A LOT OF 

6335
04:18:33,364 --> 04:18:35,433
SIMILARITIES, RIGHT, WE WERE 

6336
04:18:35,433 --> 04:18:37,468
TALKING ABOUT THIS EARLIER FROM 

6337
04:18:37,468 --> 04:18:38,669
THEIR MAKE OUR COUNTRY, RUSSIA 

6338
04:18:38,669 --> 04:18:40,071
OR AMERICA GREAT AGAIN TO THEIR 

6339
04:18:40,071 --> 04:18:43,107
SORT OF SENSE OF BEING 

6340
04:18:43,107 --> 04:18:46,344
OUTSIDERS AND RULE BREAKERS, 

6341
04:18:46,344 --> 04:18:49,446
SHAKING THINGS UP. 

6342
04:18:49,446 --> 04:18:51,816
AND EVEN SORT OF THE PROJECTION 

6343
04:18:51,816 --> 04:18:52,683
OF BEING STRONG MEN, 

6344
04:18:52,683 --> 04:18:54,385
INTENTIONALLY A STRONG MAN IN 

6345
04:18:54,385 --> 04:18:55,886
THE TRADITIONAL SENSE OF THE 

6346
04:18:55,886 --> 04:18:58,422
WAY FOR OUR PRESIDENT, BUT THEY 

6347
04:18:58,422 --> 04:19:01,559
HAVE SO MANY SIMILARITIES IN SO 

6348
04:19:01,559 --> 04:19:03,794
MANY WAYS, JUST VERY DIFFERENT 

6349
04:19:03,794 --> 04:19:04,561
AGENDAS, I THINK. 

6350
04:19:04,561 --> 04:19:07,632
>> I INTERVIEWED THE PRESIDENT 

6351
04:19:07,632 --> 04:19:11,435
RIGHT BEFORE HE ANNOUNCED HIS 

6352
04:19:11,435 --> 04:19:12,970
CANDIDACY, HE HAS THIS WAY OF 

6353
04:19:12,970 --> 04:19:16,607
KNOWING WHEN THE CAMERA IS ON, 

6354
04:19:16,607 --> 04:19:23,681
HOW HE TALKS TO YOU OFF CAMERA 

6355
04:19:23,681 --> 04:19:26,550
IS VERY DIFFERENT. 

6356
04:19:26,550 --> 04:19:27,652
HE'S CHARISMATIC, AND GENTLE, 

6357
04:19:27,652 --> 04:19:28,853
HE FLATTERS YOU. 

6358
04:19:28,853 --> 04:19:30,054
WHICH IS PERHAPS WHY HE LIKE 

6359
04:19:30,054 --> 04:19:31,288
VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS BEEN SO 

6360
04:19:31,288 --> 04:19:32,322
AGGRESSIVE WITH THE MEDIA. 

6361
04:19:32,322 --> 04:19:33,557
TRUMP KNOWS HOW THE MEDIA 

6362
04:19:33,557 --> 04:19:36,193
WORKS, HAVING BEEN A MEDIA 

6363
04:19:36,193 --> 04:19:39,130
DARLING FOR SO MANY YEARS, 

6364
04:19:39,130 --> 04:19:40,598
ALMOST HIS WHOLE LIFE THAT HE 

6365
04:19:40,598 --> 04:19:41,431
HAS DISDAIN FOR IT. 

6366
04:19:41,431 --> 04:19:47,204
>> I THINK BOTH OF THESE GUYS. 

6367
04:19:47,204 --> 04:19:53,010
PUTIN IN HIS AUTO BIOGRAPHY, A 

6368
04:19:53,010 --> 04:19:54,478
CHILDHOOD FRIEND ASKS WHAT HE 

6369
04:19:54,478 --> 04:19:54,678
DID. 

6370
04:19:54,678 --> 04:19:56,814
THIS IS WHEN HE'S IN THE KGB. 

6371
04:19:56,814 --> 04:20:00,217
HE SAID I'M A SPECIALIST IN 

6372
04:20:00,217 --> 04:20:00,650
HUMAN RELATIONS. 

6373
04:20:00,650 --> 04:20:02,586
ON THE ONE HAND, BEING A SPY IS 

6374
04:20:02,586 --> 04:20:04,622
BEING A SPECIALIST, BUT 

6375
04:20:04,622 --> 04:20:07,725
UNDERSTANDING HOW TO WORK 

6376
04:20:07,725 --> 04:20:08,926
PEOPLE, HOW TO DEVELOP SOURCES, 

6377
04:20:08,926 --> 04:20:11,094
HOW TO DEVELOP INFORMATION. 

6378
04:20:11,094 --> 04:20:12,897
TRUMP IS A SPECIALIST IN HUMAN 

6379
04:20:12,897 --> 04:20:14,365
RELATIONS BECAUSE HE'S A REAL 

6380
04:20:14,365 --> 04:20:16,934
ESTATE TYCOON WHO MADE HIS 

6381
04:20:16,934 --> 04:20:19,102
MONEY IN THE CITY IN THE 1980s. 

6382
04:20:19,102 --> 04:20:21,372
HE VIEWS THE RELATIONSHIP AS 

6383
04:20:21,372 --> 04:20:23,207
THE THING ITSELF, AS THE GOAL 

6384
04:20:23,207 --> 04:20:23,440
ITSELF. 

6385
04:20:23,440 --> 04:20:24,775
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT IT. 

6386
04:20:24,775 --> 04:20:27,010
HE SAYS HAVING A RELATIONSHIP 

6387
04:20:27,010 --> 04:20:28,846
WITH PUTIN IS GREAT. 

6388
04:20:28,846 --> 04:20:31,182
WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP, 

6389
04:20:31,182 --> 04:20:34,552
IT'S A KIND OF TRANSACTIONAL 

6390
04:20:34,552 --> 04:20:37,555
SORT OF RELATIONSHIP APPROACH 

6391
04:20:37,555 --> 04:20:38,121
TO POLITICS. 

6392
04:20:38,121 --> 04:20:40,291
IN WHICH, YOU KNOW, AGAIN FROM 

6393
04:20:40,291 --> 04:20:42,626

6394
04:20:42,626 --> 04:20:43,293

6395
04:20:43,293 --> 04:20:43,894
HUMAN RELATIONS. 

6396
04:20:43,894 --> 04:20:44,995

6397
04:20:44,995 --> 04:20:47,164

IT WAS MUTUALLY AGREED, LET'S 

6494
04:26:07,918 --> 04:26:09,520
HAVE A MEETING, I THINK IT'S A 

6495
04:26:09,520 --> 04:26:10,554
GOOD THING TO MEET. 

6496
04:26:10,554 --> 04:26:12,255
I DO BELIEVE IN MEETINGS. 

6497
04:26:12,255 --> 04:26:13,723
LOOK, I BELIEVE THAT HAVING A 

6498
04:26:13,723 --> 04:26:16,894
MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN KIM WAS A 

6499
04:26:16,894 --> 04:26:17,227
GOOD THING. 

6500
04:26:17,227 --> 04:26:19,530
I THINK HAVING MEETINGS WITH 

6501
04:26:19,530 --> 04:26:21,165
THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA WAS A 

6502
04:26:21,165 --> 04:26:22,499
VERY GOOD THING. 

6503
04:26:22,499 --> 04:26:25,302
I BELIEVE IT'S REALLY GOOD, SO 

6504
04:26:25,302 --> 04:26:27,938
HAVING MEETINGS WITH RUSSIA, 

6505
04:26:27,938 --> 04:26:29,840
CHINA, NORTH KOREA, I BELIEVE 

6506
04:26:29,840 --> 04:26:30,107
IN IT. 

6507
04:26:30,107 --> 04:26:31,408
NOTHING BAD IS GOING TO COME 

6508
04:26:31,408 --> 04:26:33,010
OUT OF IT, AND MAYBE SOME GOOD 

6509
04:26:33,010 --> 04:26:35,112
WILL COME OUT, BUT I GO IN WITH 

6510
04:26:35,112 --> 04:26:38,682
LOW EXPECTATION, I'M NOT GOING 

6511
04:26:38,682 --> 04:26:39,549
WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS. 

6512
04:26:39,549 --> 04:26:40,684
I DON'T REALLY, I CAN'T TELL 

6513
04:26:40,684 --> 04:26:41,985
YOU WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT 

6514
04:26:41,985 --> 04:26:43,587
I CAN TELL YOU WHAT I'LL BE 

6515
04:26:43,587 --> 04:26:44,922
ASKING FOR, AND WE'LL SEE IF 

6516
04:26:44,922 --> 04:26:45,688
SOMETHING COMES OF IT. 

6517
04:26:45,688 --> 04:26:48,025
>> THE RUSSIANS WHO WERE 

6518
04:26:48,025 --> 04:26:51,261
INDICTED, WOULD YOU ASK PUTIN 

6519
04:26:51,261 --> 04:26:52,596
TO SEND THEM HERE? 

6520
04:26:52,596 --> 04:26:53,563
>> WELL, I MIGHT. 

6521
04:26:53,563 --> 04:26:55,866
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT. 

6522
04:26:55,866 --> 04:26:57,568
CERTAINLY I'LL BE ASKING ABOUT 

6523
04:26:57,568 --> 04:26:57,768
IT. 

6524
04:26:57,768 --> 04:26:59,603
THIS WAS DURING THE OBAMA 

6525
04:26:59,603 --> 04:26:59,970
ADMINISTRATION. 

6526
04:26:59,970 --> 04:27:00,871
THE WERE DOING WHATEVER IT WAS 

6527
04:27:00,871 --> 04:27:01,772
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 

6528
04:27:01,772 --> 04:27:03,373
AND I HEARD THAT THEY WERE 

6529
04:27:03,373 --> 04:27:06,076
TRYING OR PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO 

6530
04:27:06,076 --> 04:27:09,046
HACK INTO THE RNC, TOO, THE 

6531
04:27:09,046 --> 04:27:10,314
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE. 

6532
04:27:10,314 --> 04:27:11,415
BUT WE HAD MUCH BETTER 

6533
04:27:11,415 --> 04:27:11,682
DEFENSES. 

6534
04:27:11,682 --> 04:27:13,317
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT BY A 

6535
04:27:13,317 --> 04:27:14,217
NUMBER OF PEOPLE. 

6536
04:27:14,217 --> 04:27:16,453
WE HAD MUCH BETTER DEFENSES SO 

6537
04:27:16,453 --> 04:27:16,886
THEY COULDN'T. 

6538
04:27:16,886 --> 04:27:18,889
I THINK THE DNC SHOULD BE 

6539
04:27:18,889 --> 04:27:20,090
ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR 

6540
04:27:20,090 --> 04:27:21,225
ALLOWING THEMSELVES TO BE 

6541
04:27:21,225 --> 04:27:21,458
HACKED. 

6542
04:27:21,458 --> 04:27:22,759
THEY HAD BAD DEFENSES AND THEY 

6543
04:27:22,759 --> 04:27:24,060
WERE ABLE TO BE HACKED. 

6544
04:27:24,060 --> 04:27:26,263
I HEARD THEY WERE TRYING TO 

6545
04:27:26,263 --> 04:27:27,965
HACK THE REPUBLICANS, TOO, BUT, 

6546
04:27:27,965 --> 04:27:33,036
AND THIS MAY BE WRONG, BUT THEY 

6547
04:27:33,036 --> 04:27:34,504
HAD MUCH STRONGER DEFENSES. 

6548
04:27:34,504 --> 04:27:36,573
>> AND JEFF GLOR IS HERE WITH 

6549
04:27:36,573 --> 04:27:36,974

6550
04:27:36,974 --> 04:27:37,574

HEADLINES AROUND THE WORLD 

6560
04:27:48,285 --> 04:27:49,419
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

6561
04:27:49,419 --> 04:27:51,021
UNITED STATES SUGGESTED IN 

6562
04:27:51,021 --> 04:27:52,990
ANTICIPATION OF THIS MEETING 

6563
04:27:52,990 --> 04:27:54,691
THAT THE FOE, HIS FOE, THE WAY 

6564
04:27:54,691 --> 04:27:56,360
HE SAW IT WAS THE EUROPEAN 

6565
04:27:56,360 --> 04:27:59,163
UNION AND HE CALLED RUSSIA A 

6566
04:27:59,163 --> 04:27:59,463
COMPETITOR. 

6567
04:27:59,463 --> 04:28:00,898
>> IT'S NOT A PLAIN QUESTION, 

6568
04:28:00,898 --> 04:28:02,199
SORT OF CAME UP DURING THE 

6569
04:28:02,199 --> 04:28:03,367
COURSE OF THE CONVERSATION AS 

6570
04:28:03,367 --> 04:28:04,735
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT NATO. 

6571
04:28:04,735 --> 04:28:06,503
I SAID WHO'S YOUR BIGGEST 

6572
04:28:06,503 --> 04:28:07,838
COMPETITOR RIGHT NOW, YOUR 

6573
04:28:07,838 --> 04:28:08,906
BIGGEST FOE GLOBALLY, AND THE 

6574
04:28:08,906 --> 04:28:11,441
FIRST THING HE SAID WAS THE 

6575
04:28:11,441 --> 04:28:11,841
EUROPEAN UNION. 

6576
04:28:11,841 --> 04:28:13,343
HE DID FOLLOW UP WITH CHINA AND 

6577
04:28:13,343 --> 04:28:14,244
RUSSIA AS WELL. 

6578
04:28:14,244 --> 04:28:16,213
AND I FOLLOWED UP WITH HIM, I 

6579
04:28:16,213 --> 04:28:17,748
SAID SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE 

6580
04:28:17,748 --> 04:28:19,983
SURPRISED TO HEAR YOU SAY THE 

6581
04:28:19,983 --> 04:28:21,451
EU FIRST AND HE DOUBLED DOWN. 

6582
04:28:21,451 --> 04:28:22,553
THERE IS THIS INTENSE FOCUS 

6583
04:28:22,553 --> 04:28:25,756
RIGHT NOW ON TRYING TO INCREASE 

6584
04:28:25,756 --> 04:28:26,957
THESE NATO PAYMENTS, AND ON 

6585
04:28:26,957 --> 04:28:30,794
REDOING THESE TRADE DEALS N. úT 

6586
04:28:30,794 --> 04:28:32,229
WHITE HOUSE AND THIS PRESIDENT 

6587
04:28:32,229 --> 04:28:35,766
SEE THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A FOE 

6588
04:28:35,766 --> 04:28:36,833
IN THAT SENSE, THAT IT'S 

6589
04:28:36,833 --> 04:28:40,504
SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE TO NOT 

6590
04:28:40,504 --> 04:28:42,205
AN ENEMY IN WAR, BUT CERTAINLY 

6591
04:28:42,205 --> 04:28:44,174
SOMETHING THAT THEY BELIEVE HAS 

6592
04:28:44,174 --> 04:28:45,341
TO BE DEALT WITH IMMEDIATELY. 

6593
04:28:45,341 --> 04:28:46,877
>> DID YOU GET A SENSE OF WHAT 

6594
04:28:46,877 --> 04:28:48,612
HE WOULD CONSIDER A WIN COMING 

6595
04:28:48,612 --> 04:28:50,681
OUT OF THIS SUMMIT OR MEETING, 

6596
04:28:50,681 --> 04:28:52,382
CONSIDERING HE SORT OF SAID TO 

6597
04:28:52,382 --> 04:28:55,419
YOU HE DIDN'T HAVE AN AGENDA 

6598
04:28:55,419 --> 04:28:55,952
GOING INTO IT? 

6599
04:28:55,952 --> 04:28:57,054
>> THE PRESIDENT, HE CLEARLY 

6600
04:28:57,054 --> 04:28:59,623
DOES LIKE THESE ONE ON ONE 

6601
04:28:59,623 --> 04:29:02,125
SETTINGS, AND DOES BELIEVE THAT 

6602
04:29:02,125 --> 04:29:04,528
HE CAN GET A READ ON SOMEONE 

6603
04:29:04,528 --> 04:29:04,961
FAIRLY QUICKLY. 

6604
04:29:04,961 --> 04:29:06,129
YOU GET TO KNOW SOMEONE BETTER 

6605
04:29:06,129 --> 04:29:10,133
THE MORE TIME YOU SPEND WITH 

6606
04:29:10,133 --> 04:29:10,333
THEM. 

6607
04:29:10,333 --> 04:29:13,370
I DO THINK WHETHER IT'S 

6608
04:29:13,370 --> 04:29:16,173
VLADIMIR PUTIN OR ANGELA MERKEL 

6609
04:29:16,173 --> 04:29:18,408
OR EMMANUEL MACRON HOWEVER 

6610
04:29:18,408 --> 04:29:19,810
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS HAS GONE, 

6611
04:29:19,810 --> 04:29:22,412
HE WANTS TO SPEND TIME IN ONE 

6612
04:29:22,412 --> 04:29:23,246
ON ONE SETTINGS. 

6613
04:29:23,246 --> 04:29:24,848
DOES HE WANT TO HAVE MORE OF AN 

6614
04:29:24,848 --> 04:29:27,050
OPEN CONVERSATION AND SEE HOW 

6615
04:29:27,050 --> 04:29:28,751
IT GOES, YEAH, I THINK SO. 

6616
04:29:28,751 --> 04:29:30,254
DOES VLADIMIR PUTIN PROBABLY 

6617
04:29:30,254 --> 04:29:33,357
HAVE A MORE CONCRETE AGENDA IN 

6618
04:29:33,357 --> 04:29:36,093
TERMS OF DELIVERABLES THAT HE 

6619
04:29:36,093 --> 04:29:36,393
WANTS? 

6620
04:29:36,393 --> 04:29:36,593
YEAH. 

6621
04:29:36,593 --> 04:29:38,328
ARE THOSE WORKABLE BETWEEN 

6622
04:29:38,328 --> 04:29:38,595
THEM? 

6623
04:29:38,595 --> 04:29:38,795
SURE. 

6624
04:29:38,795 --> 04:29:39,329
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE. 

6625
04:29:39,329 --> 04:29:40,998
I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO BE 

6626
04:29:40,998 --> 04:29:43,600
REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE IS 

6627
04:29:43,600 --> 04:29:45,035
WHO BOTH OF THEM, ESPECIALLY 

6628
04:29:45,035 --> 04:29:46,570
PRESIDENT TRUMP, SPEAK TO 

6629
04:29:46,570 --> 04:29:48,238
AFTER, BEFORE THEY GO TO THIS 

6630
04:29:48,238 --> 04:29:49,640
JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE AND THEN 

6631
04:29:49,640 --> 04:29:54,577
HOW LONG THAT PRESS C■ONFERENCE 

6632
04:29:54,577 --> 04:29:54,878
IS. 

6633
04:29:54,878 --> 04:29:56,513
THERE WAS THIS FASCINATING, 

6634
04:29:56,513 --> 04:29:57,047
EXHAUSTIVE LONG PRESS 

6635
04:29:57,047 --> 04:29:57,781
CONFERENCE AFTER SINGAPORE, 

6636
04:29:57,781 --> 04:30:00,717
RIGHT, WHERE IT WAS AN HOUR AND 

6637
04:30:00,717 --> 04:30:01,117
15 MINUTES. 

6638
04:30:01,117 --> 04:30:03,386
IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN POST 

6639
04:30:03,386 --> 04:30:06,923
PUTIN MEETING,AND WHAT WILL HE 

6640
04:30:06,923 --> 04:30:07,190
SAY. 

6641
04:30:07,190 --> 04:30:07,457
>> RIGHT. 

6642
04:30:07,457 --> 04:30:08,425
THE OTHER INTERESTING THING, I 

6643
04:30:08,425 --> 04:30:11,228
THINK, QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED 

6644
04:30:11,228 --> 04:30:12,596
WHICH GOT A MORE PECULIAR 

6645
04:30:12,596 --> 04:30:13,763
RESPONSE FROM THE PRESIDENT, 

6646
04:30:13,763 --> 04:30:14,765
YOU ASKED ABOUT RUSSIAN 

6647
04:30:14,765 --> 04:30:15,899
NATIONALS THAT HAVE BEEN 

6648
04:30:15,899 --> 04:30:17,467
INDICTED. 

6649
04:30:17,467 --> 04:30:19,036
THE UNITED STATES DOESN'T HAVE 

6650
04:30:19,036 --> 04:30:20,070
AN EXTRADITION TREATY WITH 

6651
04:30:20,070 --> 04:30:21,738
RUSSIA, THE ONLY WAY TO GET 

6652
04:30:21,738 --> 04:30:24,608
THEM TO FACE JUSTICE IS FOR THE 

6653
04:30:24,608 --> 04:30:26,343
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

6654
04:30:26,343 --> 04:30:27,477
TO ASK THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT, 

6655
04:30:27,477 --> 04:30:28,812
AND HE SAID HE HADN'T THOUGHT 

6656
04:30:28,812 --> 04:30:29,279
OF THAT. 

6657
04:30:29,279 --> 04:30:30,547
>> NOT JUST THE ONES INDICT 

6658
04:30:30,547 --> 04:30:33,984
INSTEAD THIS ROUND BUT THE LAST 

6659
04:30:33,984 --> 04:30:37,454
ONES, TOO, A COUPLE DOZEN NOW 

6660
04:30:37,454 --> 04:30:38,388
POTENTIALLY WOULD BE 

6661
04:30:38,388 --> 04:30:38,688
EXTRADITED. 

6662
04:30:38,688 --> 04:30:40,323
IT IS HARD TO SEE A WORLD IN 

6663
04:30:40,323 --> 04:30:41,992
THAT PUTIN WOULD SEND THEM 

6664
04:30:41,992 --> 04:30:44,895
HERE, BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW 

6665
04:30:44,895 --> 04:30:46,296
MUCH PRESSURE IS APPLIED, HOW 

6666
04:30:46,296 --> 04:30:47,597
THAT REQUEST IS MADE, WHETHER 

6667
04:30:47,597 --> 04:30:49,800
THERE'S ANY WIGGLE ROOM TO HAVE 

6668
04:30:49,800 --> 04:30:50,133
THAT DONE. 

6669
04:30:50,133 --> 04:30:54,705
AGAIN, HARD TO SEE THAT 

6670
04:30:54,705 --> 04:30:55,705
HAPPENING IN ANY WAY. 

6671
04:30:55,705 --> 04:30:58,075
BUT HE SAID HE WOULD THINK 

6672
04:30:58,075 --> 04:30:58,541
ABOUT IT. 

6673
04:30:58,541 --> 04:31:01,078
AND NOW WOULD ASK PUTIN ABOUT 

6674
04:31:01,078 --> 04:31:01,511
IT. 

6675
04:31:01,511 --> 04:31:02,479
>> IT CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE WHEN 

6676
04:31:02,479 --> 04:31:04,047
IT COMES TO THE RUSSIA 

6677
04:31:04,047 --> 04:31:05,048
INVESTIGATION OR RUSSIAN 

6678
04:31:05,048 --> 04:31:05,949
MEDDLING, THAT TOPIC, IT'S 

6679
04:31:05,949 --> 04:31:06,983
CONNECTED TO THE RUSSIA 

6680
04:31:06,983 --> 04:31:07,717
INVESTIGATION FOR HIM. 

6681
04:31:07,717 --> 04:31:09,219
HE CAN'T KIND OF SEPARATE THE 

6682
04:31:09,219 --> 04:31:13,523
TWO, AND HE REPEATEDLY CALLED 

6683
04:31:13,523 --> 04:31:15,458
IT A WITCH HUNT AGAIN. 

6684
04:31:15,458 --> 04:31:16,927
>> I DO THINK THE SEPARATION IS 

6685
04:31:16,927 --> 04:31:18,762
IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THAT 

6686
04:31:18,762 --> 04:31:20,030
THE MEDDLING AND THE RUSSIAN 

6687
04:31:20,030 --> 04:31:21,764
INTERFERENCE IS ONE THING. 

6688
04:31:21,764 --> 04:31:23,767
HE SAYS IT'S A WITCH HUNT WHEN 

6689
04:31:23,767 --> 04:31:25,168
HE TALKS ABOUT JUST GOING AFTER 

6690
04:31:25,168 --> 04:31:26,603
HIM IN PARTICULAR, AND THAT, 

6691
04:31:26,603 --> 04:31:29,339
YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T NECESSARILY 

6692
04:31:29,339 --> 04:31:31,241
DO ANYTHING WRONG, HOWEVER YOU 

6693
04:31:31,241 --> 04:31:33,643
DEBATE HOW MUCH RUSSIANS 

6694
04:31:33,643 --> 04:31:35,145
AFFECTED OUR ELECTION, BUT THE 

6695
04:31:35,145 --> 04:31:38,448
INTERESTING PART ABOUT THIS IS 

6696
04:31:38,448 --> 04:31:39,583
WHAT THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 

6697
04:31:39,583 --> 04:31:40,517
INTELLIGENCE DAN COATES SAID 

6698
04:31:40,517 --> 04:31:43,086
THE OTHER DAY, WE ARE AT THIS 

6699
04:31:43,086 --> 04:31:46,590
CRITICAL POINT WHEN IT COMES 

6700
04:31:46,590 --> 04:31:47,357
OUR DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE, 

6701
04:31:47,357 --> 04:31:49,359
LIKE WE WERE PRE9/11, IN TERMS 

6702
04:31:49,359 --> 04:31:53,630
OF CLOSE TO A POTENTIAL MAJOR 

6703
04:31:53,630 --> 04:31:54,664
VERY BAD ATTACK. 

6704
04:31:54,664 --> 04:31:56,867
AND THOSE ARE THE SIGNS THEY'RE 

6705
04:31:56,867 --> 04:31:58,402
SEEING FROM THE RUSSIANS AND 

6706
04:31:58,402 --> 04:32:00,337
THE NORTH KOREANS AND OTHERS 

6707
04:32:00,337 --> 04:32:01,872
AGAIN, IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY 

6708
04:32:01,872 --> 04:32:03,039
MIGHT BE ABLE TO PENETRATE. 

6709
04:32:03,039 --> 04:32:04,907
>> AND THE NORTH KOREANS. 

6710
04:32:04,907 --> 04:32:07,010
>> AND THE WORLD HAS CHANGED IN 

6711
04:32:07,010 --> 04:32:07,343
17 YEARS. 

6712
04:32:07,343 --> 04:32:09,212
YOU ATTACK, YOU CARRY OUT 

6713
04:32:09,212 --> 04:32:10,080
TERROR ATTACKS IN DIFFERENT 

6714
04:32:10,080 --> 04:32:11,848
WAYS THAN YOU DID 20 YEARS AGO. 

6715
04:32:11,848 --> 04:32:14,284
I DID ASK HIM ABOUT WHAT THE 

6716
04:32:14,284 --> 04:32:16,086
DNI SAID. 

6717
04:32:16,086 --> 04:32:17,954
HE SAID, LISTEN, I'M AWARE OF 

6718
04:32:17,954 --> 04:32:18,154
THAT. 

6719
04:32:18,154 --> 04:32:19,423
HE DIDN'T BITE TOO MUCH ON 

6720
04:32:19,423 --> 04:32:19,623
THAT. 

6721
04:32:19,623 --> 04:32:22,893
BUT I THINK SOME OF THE 

6722
04:32:22,893 --> 04:32:24,995
COMMENTS FROM COATES HAVE BEEN 

6723
04:32:24,995 --> 04:32:25,328
INTERESTING. 

6724
04:32:25,328 --> 04:32:27,097
>> AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, YOU 

6725
04:32:27,097 --> 04:32:28,031
PLAN ON INTERVIEWING THE 

6726
04:32:28,031 --> 04:32:28,865
PRESIDENT WEDNESDAY, GIVEN WHAT 

6727
04:32:28,865 --> 04:32:30,167
HE SAID THIS WEEKEND, AND WHAT 

6728
04:32:30,167 --> 04:32:31,835
WE EXPECT TO SEE COMING OUT OF 

6729
04:32:31,835 --> 04:32:33,170
THIS RUSSIA MEETING, GIVE US A 

6730
04:32:33,170 --> 04:32:34,337
PREVIEW OF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING 

6731
04:32:34,337 --> 04:32:35,272
TO HEAR FROM HIM? 

6732
04:32:35,272 --> 04:32:37,808
>> WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKING HIM 

6733
04:32:37,808 --> 04:32:39,242
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN HELSINKI 

6734
04:32:39,242 --> 04:32:41,111
HERE, WHAT HIS SENSE OF, YOU 

6735
04:32:41,111 --> 04:32:42,245
KNOW, HE'LL HAVE TALKED ABOUT 

6736
04:32:42,245 --> 04:32:43,580
IT A COUPLE OF TIMES. 

6737
04:32:43,580 --> 04:32:44,614
I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING AND 

6738
04:32:44,614 --> 04:32:46,116
APPEALING FOR US IS WE'LL GET A 

6739
04:32:46,116 --> 04:32:48,118
CHANCE TO TALK TO HIM, YOU 

6740
04:32:48,118 --> 04:32:49,753
KNOW, AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN I 

6741
04:32:49,753 --> 04:32:51,188
THINK HE'S HAD A CHANCE TO 

6742
04:32:51,188 --> 04:32:53,423
RESET A LITTLE BIT BACK HERE. 

6743
04:32:53,423 --> 04:32:56,092
AND FIGURE OUT WHERE THINGS GO 

6744
04:32:56,092 --> 04:32:57,360
SORT OF POST MEETING, POST 

6745
04:32:57,360 --> 04:32:58,895
SUMMIT, WHATEVER YOU CARE TO 

6746
04:32:58,895 --> 04:32:59,228
CALL IT. 

6747
04:32:59,228 --> 04:32:59,996
>> RIGHT. 

6748
04:32:59,996 --> 04:33:01,865
>> AFTER THIS. 

6749
04:33:01,865 --> 04:33:03,500
AND THEN WHAT COMES NEXT WITH 

6750
04:33:03,500 --> 04:33:05,068
VLADIMIR PUTIN, NOW THAT THEY 

6751
04:33:05,068 --> 04:33:07,070
WILL HAVE MET, WHATEVER IT IS, 

6752
04:33:07,070 --> 04:33:08,004
3, 3 1/2 TIMES. 

6753
04:33:08,004 --> 04:33:09,573
>> WE HAVE BEEN ANALYZING THE 

6754
04:33:09,573 --> 04:33:09,939
BODY LANGUAGE. 

6755
04:33:09,939 --> 04:33:11,374
THAT'S ALL WE HAD AT THIS 

6756
04:33:11,374 --> 04:33:12,809
INITIAL MEETING THAT WE SAW. 

6757
04:33:12,809 --> 04:33:14,578
SO I WANT TO GET A SENSE FROM 

6758
04:33:14,578 --> 04:33:16,846
YOU, DID HE SEEM RELAXED. 

6759
04:33:16,846 --> 04:33:18,882
>> HE SEEMED LIKE IT'S THE 

6760
04:33:18,882 --> 04:33:20,417
SAME, YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT 

6761
04:33:20,417 --> 04:33:21,884
PREFERS TO SIT FORWARD LIKE 

6762
04:33:21,884 --> 04:33:25,488
THIS, AND YOU KNOW, PUTIN WAS A 

6763
04:33:25,488 --> 04:33:25,989
LITTLE MORE. 

6764
04:33:25,989 --> 04:33:27,023
>> BUT IN YOUR INTERVIEW. 

6765
04:33:27,023 --> 04:33:29,626
>> OH, IN THE INTERVIEW, IT WAS 

6766
04:33:29,626 --> 04:33:29,992
THE SAME. 

6767
04:33:29,992 --> 04:33:31,628
THE WAY I EXPECTED HIM TO SIT, 

6768
04:33:31,628 --> 04:33:34,296
THE WAY HE ALWAYS SITS IN ALL 

6769
04:33:34,296 --> 04:33:35,966
OF THESE MEETINGS AND FOR ME AT 

6770
04:33:35,966 --> 04:33:37,133
LEAST SITTING ACROSS, I'M JUST 

6771
04:33:37,133 --> 04:33:38,133
TRYING TO BE COMFORTABLE, 

6772
04:33:38,133 --> 04:33:39,803
TRYING TO MAKE SURE WHOEVER IT 

6773
04:33:39,803 --> 04:33:44,608
IS I'M TALKING TO IS COMFORT  

6774
04:33:44,608 --> 04:33:45,876
-- COMFORTABLE, AND YOU'RE ABLE 

6775
04:33:45,876 --> 04:33:46,442
TO SPEAK OPENLY. 

6776
04:33:46,442 --> 04:33:49,112
>> YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE BODY 

6777
04:33:49,112 --> 04:33:49,713
LANGUAGE ALL DAY. 

6778
04:33:49,713 --> 04:33:53,049
>> WHETHER IT'S THIS, WHETHER 

6779
04:33:53,049 --> 04:33:55,252
IT'S PUTIN, AND TRUMP MEETING, 

6780
04:33:55,252 --> 04:33:56,753
IT'S SUPER FASCINATING TO 

6781
04:33:56,753 --> 04:33:57,152
SPECULATE ABOUT. 

6782
04:33:57,152 --> 04:33:58,788
I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH IT 

6783
04:33:58,788 --> 04:34:00,056
ACTUALLY MEANS BUT IT IS 

6784
04:34:00,056 --> 04:34:00,623
INTERESTING. 

6785
04:34:00,623 --> 04:34:00,990
>> ALL RIGHT. 

6786
04:34:00,990 --> 04:34:02,359
WE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS 

6787
04:34:02,359 --> 04:34:03,593
INTERVIEW ON WEDNESDAY, JEFF. 

6788
04:34:03,593 --> 04:34:04,860
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING. 

6789
04:34:04,860 --> 04:34:06,529
>> AND WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE 

6790
04:34:06,529 --> 04:34:07,731
TONIGHT ON THE EVENING NEWS, 

6791
04:34:07,731 --> 04:34:09,331
AND WE HAVE YET TO RELEASE MOST 

6792
04:34:09,331 --> 04:34:10,266
OF THIS INTERVIEW. 

6793
04:34:10,266 --> 04:34:11,468
THERE'S A LOT MORE TO COME. 

6794
04:34:11,468 --> 04:34:13,003
I THINK YOU'LL SEE THE 

6795
04:34:13,003 --> 04:34:14,169
PRESIDENT GET A LITTLE MORE 

6796
04:34:14,169 --> 04:34:15,639
REFLECTIVE AND THERE'S OTHER 

6797
04:34:15,639 --> 04:34:18,942
NEWS, I THINK, THAT MIGHT BE 

6798
04:34:18,942 --> 04:34:20,644
MADE. 

6799
04:34:20,644 --> 04:34:21,744
>> WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. 

6800
04:34:21,744 --> 04:34:23,113
>> JEFF GLOR, THANK YOU VERY 

6801
04:34:23,113 --> 04:34:23,312
MUCH. 

6802
04:34:23,312 --> 04:34:25,282
>>> NEARLY A YEAR AFTER TWO 

6803
04:34:25,282 --> 04:34:28,350
DEADLY HURRICANES WREAK HAVOC 

6804
04:34:28,350 --> 04:34:30,220
ON PUERTO RICO, MORE THAN 1000 

6805
04:34:30,220 --> 04:34:32,922
HOMES AND BUSINESSES ARE 

6806
04:34:32,922 --> 04:34:34,422
WITHOUT ELECTRICITY. 

6807
04:34:34,422 --> 04:34:35,057
OFFICIALS PROMISED ELECTRICITY 

6808
04:34:35,057 --> 04:34:36,359
WOULD BE RESTORED TO THE ENTIRE 

6809
04:34:36,359 --> 04:34:38,728
ISLAND TWO MONTHS AGO. 

6810
04:34:38,728 --> 04:34:40,529
VOLUNTEERS ARE CONTINUING TO 

6811
04:34:40,529 --> 04:34:42,632
DELIVER SOLAR POWERED LAMPS AND 

6812
04:34:42,632 --> 04:34:44,200
SUPPLIES TO THOSE IN REMOTE 

6813
04:34:44,200 --> 04:34:44,433
AREAS. 

6814
04:34:44,433 --> 04:34:46,169
>> POWER POLES HAVE BEEN 

6815
04:34:46,169 --> 04:34:47,203
INSTALLED, AND ALMOST 200 

6816
04:34:47,203 --> 04:34:48,371
