1
00:00:00,479 --> 00:00:01,412
THEN HE CONTINUES TO CONDEMN

2
00:00:01,413 --> 00:00:03,881
VIOLENCE IN ALL FORMS.

3
00:00:03,882 --> 00:00:05,483
>> Dana: THANK YOU.

4
00:00:05,484 --> 00:00:06,551
PRESIDENT TRUMP REACTED TO THE

5
00:00:06,552 --> 00:00:08,686
NEWS AT HIS RALLY IN WISCONSIN

6
00:00:08,687 --> 00:00:09,520
LAST NIGHT.

7
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:10,722
>> President Trump: MY HIGHEST

8
00:00:10,723 --> 00:00:12,690
DUTY, AS YOU KNOW AS PRESIDENT

9
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:16,728
IS TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE.

10
00:00:16,729 --> 00:00:18,896
ANY ACT OR THREAT OF POLITICAL

11
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:20,865
VIOLENCE ARE AN ATTACK ON OUR

12
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:23,901
DEMOCRACY ITSELF.

13
00:00:23,902 --> 00:00:30,541
WE WANT ALL SIDES TO COME

14
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:31,242
TOGETHER IN PEACE AND HARMONY.

15
00:00:31,243 --> 00:00:34,078
THE MEDIA ALSO HAS A

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:34,779
RESPONSIBILITY TO SET A CIVIL

17
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,885
TONE AND STOP THE ENDLESS

18
00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:41,619
HOSTILITY AND CONSTANT NEGATIVE

19
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,057
AND OFTENTIMES FALSE ATTACKS.

20
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:47,759
>> Dana: PAM, CAN WE START

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,159
WITH YOU?

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,660
TRACE GALLAGHER'S THING THAT WE

23
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:51,529
CONFIRM THEY ARE HONING IN ON

24
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,331
FLORIDA AS A POSSIBLE PLACE

25
00:00:53,332 --> 00:00:55,633
WHERE THESE PACKAGES WERE SENT

26
00:00:55,634 --> 00:00:55,933
FROM.

27
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:56,634
>> Pam: WITHOUT DETAILS

28
00:00:56,635 --> 00:00:58,336
SPECIFICALLY TO FLORIDA COME AS

29
00:00:58,337 --> 00:01:00,905
A CAREER PROSECUTOR, I'VE SEEN

30
00:01:00,906 --> 00:01:02,340
SO MANY OF THESE CASES WITH

31
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:03,141
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES.

32
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:04,742
THERE IS A WEALTH OF

33
00:01:04,742 --> 00:01:07,078
INFORMATION, DANA, AND THE

34
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:07,745
PACKAGES.

35
00:01:07,746 --> 00:01:08,446
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

36
00:01:08,447 --> 00:01:09,113
EVEN THE DUCT TAPE.

37
00:01:09,114 --> 00:01:13,117
I HAD A MURDER CASE.

38
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:14,519
STAMPS THAT YOU USED TO LICK.

39
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,154
NOW WE HAVE TOUCHED DNA.

40
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:17,488
IF THEY TOUCH THE STAMP, WE CAN

41
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:19,891
GET DNA OFF THE STAMP.

42
00:01:19,892 --> 00:01:20,691
AS TO THE POST OFFICE, WE CAN

43
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:22,093
EVEN GET THE ORIGIN AS TO WHERE

44
00:01:22,094 --> 00:01:22,727
IT CAME.

45
00:01:22,728 --> 00:01:24,996
I THINK THEY ARE WORKING ON ALL

46
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:27,098
THAT.

47
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:28,533
WAS IT WELL-PLANNED?

48
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:29,100
YES AND NO.

49
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:30,301
THEY ALL WENT OUT

50
00:01:30,302 --> 00:01:31,002
SIMULTANEOUSLY.

51
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:33,905
HOWEVER NO, IN THAT NAMES WERE

52
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:34,539
SPELLED WRONG.

53
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,074
SOME OF THE ADDRESS AS WE KNOW

54
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:38,142
ARE WRONG AND GOT RETURNED TO

55
00:01:38,143 --> 00:01:38,476
SENDER.

56
00:01:38,477 --> 00:01:39,710
>> Dana: DO YOU THINK THAT

57
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:41,312
COULD'VE BEEN ON PURPOSE?

58
00:01:41,313 --> 00:01:42,914
>> Pam: MAY BE.

59
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:44,082
I KNOW THAT THEY KNOW A LOT MORE

60
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,450
THAN WE KNOW AND THAT'S HOW IT

61
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:46,717
SHOULD BE RIGHT NOW AND I REALLY

62
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:48,419
HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEY WILL

63
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,520
CATCH THIS PERSON VERY FAST.

64
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:50,855
I SAW THE PRESIDENT YESTERDAY

65
00:01:50,856 --> 00:01:52,824
THE WHITE HOUSE, AND HE WAS SO

66
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:53,157
SOMBER.

67
00:01:53,158 --> 00:01:53,591
YOU SAW HIM.

68
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:57,328
HE WAS SO SOMBER.

69
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:57,995
VERY SERIOUSLY, EVERYONE IS

70
00:01:57,996 --> 00:02:00,131
TAKING THIS.

71
00:02:00,132 --> 00:02:01,199
THE FBI'S ALL OVER IT.

72
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,069
>> Dana: GREG, LET'S GO TO YOU

73
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,336
YOU.

74
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:05,903
ONGOING CONVERSATION.

75
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:07,672
YOU SEE THE ACTIVITY THIS

76
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:08,306
MORNING?

77
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:08,972
>> Greg: I DON'T KNOW WHAT

78
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:10,874
TIME IT WAS.

79
00:02:10,876 --> 00:02:13,911
I AM A FEW BLOCKS FROM THERE, SO

80
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:14,679
I WOKE UP TO THE HELICOPTERS

81
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,114
THAT WERE I GUESS ABOVE ME FOR

82
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:25,323
AT LEAST A FEW HOURS.

83
00:02:25,324 --> 00:02:26,057
I GOT UP AND TOLD MY WIFE, I GO,

84
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:26,657
"SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.

85
00:02:26,658 --> 00:02:27,291
IT'S DEFINITELY DOWNTOWN."

86
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:28,226
AND THEN IT WENT ON FOR A COUPLE

87
00:02:28,227 --> 00:02:29,527
HOURS.

88
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:30,828
>> Dana: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF

89
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:33,498
THE CONVERSATION TODAY THAT WAS

90
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:33,965
INEVITABLE ABOUT

91
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:34,932
PRESIDENT TRUMP, HIS TONE, IS

92
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:37,201
SAYING THAT THE MEDIA NEEDS TO

93
00:02:37,202 --> 00:02:39,070
WATCH THE STONE.

94
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:40,404
>> Greg: ALL THESE THINGS

95
00:02:40,405 --> 00:02:43,207
COMING OR GOING TO GET

96
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:43,674
FINGER-POINTING.

97
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:44,475
EVERYONE CAN POINT FINGERS,

98
00:02:44,476 --> 00:02:45,143
DEPENDING ON WHAT GROUP YOU

99
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:47,311
BELONG TO.

100
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:49,480
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO TAKE ADVICE

101
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:51,482
FROM THE MEDIA OVERHEATED

102
00:02:51,483 --> 00:02:54,485
RHETORIC, BECAUSE IF YOU WERE TO

103
00:02:54,486 --> 00:02:56,687
SUBTRACT THE HEATED RHETORIC OF

104
00:02:56,688 --> 00:02:57,021
TRUMP.

105
00:02:57,022 --> 00:02:59,056
LET'S SAY THE CAUSTIC BEHAVIOR,

106
00:02:59,057 --> 00:03:00,224
THE JOKES ABOUT SLEEPY EYES AND

107
00:03:00,225 --> 00:03:01,559
LOCK HIM UP.

108
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,694
IF YOU TOOK IT ALL AWAY, YOU

109
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:05,696
WOULD STILL HAVE SPEAKERS ON

110
00:03:05,697 --> 00:03:06,264
CAMPUS BEING HARASSED.

111
00:03:06,265 --> 00:03:10,067
HE WOULD STILL HAVE ANTIFA

112
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:11,302
CHASING DOWN PEOPLE ON STREETS.

113
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:13,871
HE WOULD STILL HAVE POLITICIANS

114
00:03:13,872 --> 00:03:15,072
INCITING FACE-TO-FACE

115
00:03:15,073 --> 00:03:15,473
HARASSMENT.

116
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:16,174
KATHY GRIFFIN, JOHNNY DEPP,

117
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:17,708
MADONNA.

118
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,310
THEY ALL DID THAT STUFF EARLY

119
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:19,577
ON.

120
00:03:19,578 --> 00:03:25,216
YOU HAVE MIKA ASSESSING OVER THE

121
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:26,884
25TH AMENDMENT.

122
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:29,287
EVENT TWO YEARS OF QUESTIONING

123
00:03:29,288 --> 00:03:29,954
TRUMP'S SANITY, CALLING HIM

124
00:03:29,955 --> 00:03:30,288
HITLER.

125
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:32,690
AND YOU ARE UPSET ABOUT HE MADE

126
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:34,692
A JOKE ABOUT A BODY SLAM.

127
00:03:34,693 --> 00:03:36,928
DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

128
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:37,895
>> Dana: I THINK THE LEFT

129
00:03:37,896 --> 00:03:40,097
WOULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY.

130
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:42,533
>> Juan: I THINK THE LEFT

131
00:03:42,534 --> 00:03:43,701
FEELS LIKE IT'S A DIFFICULT

132
00:03:43,702 --> 00:03:44,735
MOMENT FOR ALL OF US.

133
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:45,903
IT'S A VERY DIVIDED COUNTRY

134
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:47,038
RIGHT NOW, AND I THINK IT'S KIND

135
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,440
OF SAD THAT WE'VE REACHED THIS

136
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:49,740
POINT.

137
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:52,109
I THINK PEOPLE ON THE LEFT ARE

138
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,544
KIND OF TAKEN ABACK.

139
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:55,146
THE PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT SEEMED

140
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:55,913
TO BE MORE PRESIDENTIAL AND

141
00:03:55,914 --> 00:03:58,115
SAYING THAT WE NEED TO UNIFY,

142
00:03:58,116 --> 00:03:58,716
COME TOGETHER.

143
00:03:58,717 --> 00:03:59,550
YOU CAN'T ATTACK POLITICAL

144
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:00,351
OPPONENTS.

145
00:04:00,352 --> 00:04:01,686
THIS MORNING HE SHIFTS AGAIN, AS

146
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:03,955
YOU ARE SUGGESTING TO GREG, AND

147
00:04:03,956 --> 00:04:04,689
SAYS THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA NEEDS

148
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,091
TO CLEAN UP ITS ACT IN TERMS OF

149
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:07,792
SETTING THE TONE.

150
00:04:07,793 --> 00:04:09,994
THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN PRETTY

151
00:04:09,995 --> 00:04:10,294
CLEAR.

152
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:12,029
JEFF ZUCKER, THE HEAD OF CNN,

153
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,097
AND OTHERS SAYING THAT THE TONE

154
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:15,766
IS REALLY SET BY THE POLITICIAN,

155
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:16,200
THE PRESIDENT.

156
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:18,803
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO IS

157
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:19,769
TALKED ABOUT SECOND AMENDMENT

158
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:21,939
PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF HILLARY

159
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,708
AND BODY SLAMMING REPORTERS.

160
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:24,175
I CAN GO ON.

161
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:26,677
EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS.

162
00:04:26,678 --> 00:04:27,945
EVEN IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, WITH

163
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:29,113
FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES.

164
00:04:29,114 --> 00:04:31,549
I THINK THERE'S A SENSE THAT HIS

165
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,850
INSTINCT IS TO BE A COMBATIVE

166
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:36,621
PRESIDENT AND THAT IN FACT AS A

167
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:37,321
POLITICAL STRATEGY APPROACHING

168
00:04:37,322 --> 00:04:39,290
THE MIDTERMS, HE SEES THE

169
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,091
DIVISION AS FIRING UP HIS BASE

170
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:42,293
AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST

171
00:04:42,294 --> 00:04:44,929
WORRY THAT YOU CAN'T -- WE CAN'T

172
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,330
AS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KEEP

173
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:48,599
GOING DOWN THIS PATH WITHOUT

174
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,735
RESPECTING, DARE SAY LOVING EACH

175
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:51,736
OTHER, AS FELLOW AMERICANS.

176
00:04:51,737 --> 00:04:54,305
>> Dana: LAST WEEK AND THE NBC

177
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:55,139
"WALL STREET JOURNAL" POLL, 90%

178
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,540
OF AMERICANS SAID WE ARE THE

179
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,842
MOST DIVIDED WE'VE EVER BEEN.

180
00:04:57,843 --> 00:05:00,745
WE ACTUALLY AGREE ON SOMETHING.

181
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:02,580
THE CONVERSATION WE COULD HAVE

182
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:04,215
ABOUT RHETORIC COULD HAVE

183
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:04,782
HAPPENED WITHOUT THESE

184
00:05:04,783 --> 00:05:05,516
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES.

185
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:07,118
IT'S BASIC THAT'S TRUE.

186
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:09,220
IT'S BEEN BOILING UP FOR A LONG

187
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:09,754
TIME.

188
00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:11,889
TALKING ABOUT TONE, JUAN BROUGHT

189
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,725
UP, WE MAKE FUN OF CROOKED

190
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:15,426
HILLARY AND WE SAY POCAHONTAS

191
00:05:15,427 --> 00:05:17,695
AND MAKE FUN OF SPARTACUS.

192
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:20,131
>> Greg: AND THAT IS JUST YOU.

193
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:22,066
>> Jesse: WE GO AFTER PEOPLE'S

194
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:23,000
POLICIES AND WE MOCK THEM IF

195
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:23,901
THEY ARE BEING DECEITFUL AND

196
00:05:23,902 --> 00:05:25,102
WHAT HAVE YOU.

197
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:26,370
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY THIS TABLE

198
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:40,785
SAYS THIS PERSON IS A NAZI.

199
00:05:40,786 --> 00:05:41,485
THIS PERSON HATES OTHER ETHNIC

200
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:41,819
GROUPS.

201
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,486
I WANT TO SEE THIS POLITICAL

202
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:43,154
OPPONENT, I WANT TO SEE HARM

203
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:43,688
DONE TO THAT PERSON.

204
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:44,255
I THINK WE ARE PRETTY

205
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:44,889
RESPONSIBLE AT THIS TABLE.

206
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,623
WHEN STEVE SCALISE WAS SHOT, NO

207
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:46,857
ONE AT THIS TABLE BLAMED

208
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:49,093
BERNIE SANDERS.

209
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:49,994
BERNIE SANDERS HIMSELF NEVER

210
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:50,561
ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY.

211
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:54,532
PELOSI NEVER ACCEPTED

212
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:56,133
RESPONSIBILITY WHEN PEOPLE RAISE

213
00:05:56,134 --> 00:05:56,801
QUESTIONS ABOUT DEMOCRATIC

214
00:05:56,802 --> 00:05:57,168
RHETORIC.

215
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:00,137
GREG LAID IT OUT.

216
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:01,138
THE LIST IS LONG.

217
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,540
PEOPLE'S RIBS HAVE BEEN CRACKED,

218
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,875
PEOPLE UP AND TRIED TO BE

219
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:06,711
STABBED, CARS HAVE BEEN

220
00:06:06,712 --> 00:06:07,545
FIREBOMBED.

221
00:06:07,546 --> 00:06:09,747
ANTHRAX AND RICIN HAVE BEEN SENT

222
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:10,548
AROUND.

223
00:06:10,549 --> 00:06:11,315
KATHY GRIFFIN, SNOOP DOGG,

224
00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:12,116
HILLARY CLINTON THE OTHER DAY

225
00:06:12,117 --> 00:06:13,951
SAYING THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO BE

226
00:06:13,952 --> 00:06:14,352
CIVIL.

227
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:16,554
SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO BE UNCIVIL.

228
00:06:16,555 --> 00:06:17,555
WE NEVER MAKE DEMOCRATS

229
00:06:17,556 --> 00:06:18,356
ACCESSORY TO THE CRIMES

230
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:18,756
POLITICALLY.

231
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:20,324
WHAT THE LEFT IS DOING NOW AS

232
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:22,893
THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE

233
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:24,562
DONALD TRUMP AN ACCESSORY TO

234
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:25,262
THESE ATTEMPTED MAIL BOMBINGS

235
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:26,897
AND SAYING THAT YOU ARE AN

236
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:27,665
ACCESSORY AND THEREFORE YOU NEED

237
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,134
TO STOP ATTACKING THE MEDIA AND

238
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:31,502
YOU NEED TO STOP ATTACKING

239
00:06:31,503 --> 00:06:32,636
DEMOCRATS BEFORE THE MIDTERM

240
00:06:32,637 --> 00:06:33,504
ELECTIONS.

241
00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:34,505
I DON'T THINK HE HAS A

242
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:36,540
RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT.

243
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,943
I AGREE, TRUMP TALKS TOUGH

244
00:06:38,944 --> 00:06:39,310
SOMETIMES.

245
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:41,245
SOMETIMES IT'S TOO TOUGH.

246
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:42,113
A LOT OF TIMES HE'S BEING

247
00:06:42,114 --> 00:06:42,947
TONGUE-IN-CHEEK AND THE MEDIA

248
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:44,749
HAS NO SENSE OF HUMOR AND THEY

249
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,983
DON'T GET IT.

250
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:47,718
I AGREE SOMETIMES HE DOES CROSS

251
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:48,119
THE LINE.

252
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,720
WHEN YOU ARE SLAMMING SOMEONE IN

253
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:50,755
THE VIDEO YOU'RE GOING LIKE THIS

254
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:52,656
AND YOU'RE MOCKING SOMEONE

255
00:06:52,657 --> 00:06:54,392
GETTING PUNCHED, IT'S A LITTLE

256
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:56,527
DIFFERENT THAN WHEN THE MEDIA

257
00:06:56,528 --> 00:00:00,000
CALLS YOU A MENTALLY ILL NAZI
