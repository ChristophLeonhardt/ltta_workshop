1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,009
much of America has reacted swiftly and
strongly to donald trump's grotesque

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,490
suggestion that there is a moral
equivalence between the white

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,900
supremacist who converged last weekend
on Charlottesville Virginia and those

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,520
who protested against them but the
delayed qualified and often

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,960
mealy-mouthed reactions of many in
America's leadership class tell a

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,279
disturbing story about the country's
elites and the reason we are living in

7
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,800
an age of populist rebellion the least
respected of today's leaders are of

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,880
course politicians the public largely
views them as Craven and cowardly

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,739
pandering to polls and focus groups and
that is how to many republican officials

10
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,570
have behaved in the face of Trump's
words and actions men and women who

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,160
usually cannot stop pontificating on
every topic on live TV with some

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,079
honorable exceptions have suddenly gone
mute on the biggest political subject of

13
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,510
the day I know they worry about the base
about primaries about right-wing donors

14
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,619
but shouldn't they also worry about
their country and their conscience

15
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,130
shouldn't they ask themselves why they
went into public service in the first

16
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,600
place and if they see someone at the
highest level trampling on the values of

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,890
the country shouldn't they speak up
directly forcefully and without

18
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,020
qualification business leaders meanwhile
are still among the most respected and

19
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,189
envied people in America today
they run vast organizations get paid on

20
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,250
a scale that makes their predecessors
from just 25 years ago

21
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,479
look middle-class and live in a bubble
of private planes helicopters and

22
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,220
limousines in other words they have all
the wealth power and security that

23
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,140
should allow them to set standards and
well lead instead for the most part

24
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,030
business leaders have also been cowards
most of them surely think Trump is a

25
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,860
charlatan a snake oil salesman in the
past many chose not to do business with

26
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,110
him because they believed he was
unethical

27
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,759
others were initially amused by his
candidacy but regarded his rhetoric on

28
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,280
trade immigration refugees as lonesome
and yet almost none of them spoke out

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,878
against him display if you even
distanced themselves from him after he

30
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,140
blame on many sides for the violence in
charlottesville had

31
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,790
books CEO Kenneth Fraser not resigned
from one of trumps advisory boards it's

32
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,410
unclear whether others would have spoken
out and even then some JumpShip only

33
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,730
when it became clear there was really no
alternative after Trump doubled down on

34
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:33,150
his initial comments America once did
have more public minded elites but they

35
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,740
came from a small club II work the
Protestant establishment not all were

36
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,580
born rich but they knew they had a
secure place atop the country they

37
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,200
populated the country's boardrooms
public offices and its best schools this

38
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,300
security gave them greater comfort in
exercising moral leadership today we

39
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,110
have a more merit-based elite what is
often called a meritocracy it has

40
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,100
allowed people from all walks of life to
rise up into positions of power and

41
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,890
influence but these new elites are more
insecure anxious self-centered

42
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,100
politicians are likely to be solo
entrepreneurs worried about the next

43
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,480
primary or the fundraiser CEOs live with
the constant fear that they might lose

44
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,310
their jobs or their company might lose
its customers in an instant they may not

45
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,840
think they have the luxury to be
high-minded but they do they are all

46
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,299
vastly more secure than most people in
America or in human history if they

47
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,370
cannot act out a broader interest who
can the group of leaders who deserve the

48
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,900
most praise this week are the military
brass in a remarkable act of leadership

49
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,310
for people who work under the President
all five of the heads of the Armed

50
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,530
Forces independently issued statements
unequivocally denouncing racism and

51
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,549
bigotry perhaps this is because the
military has been the institution that

52
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:55,620
has most successfully integrated
America's diverse population perhaps it

53
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,100
is because the military remains an
old-fashioned place where a sense of

54
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,170
honor standards and values still holds
the military chiefs have shown why they

55
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,180
still command so much respect in the
country America's other release should

56
00:04:09,180 --> 00:00:00,000
perhaps take note
