we've told you about Mick Mulvaney he was the director of the Office of Management and Budget he is massively for tax cuts for the rich says it all the time oh that tax plan winds up raising taxes on the middle class in the poor oops we do that accordance it ends well that wasn't enough for Mick Mulvaney so he wants to move over to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Donald Trump has appointed him as the Acting Director even though technically and legally he's not supposed to be the acting director by law the acting director is the deputy director so they made a mess of it it's an absolute constitutional nightmare but why have they gone through these extra lengths and potentially illegal acts to get Mulvaney into that Bureau because it's in the name it's supposed to protect consumers and they don't want that Mulvaney in the past has called it a sick sad joke this agency he has come in to destroy and and has authored legislation to completely eliminate the agency so he is there to destroy they just say not to run it and we told you in a recent TYT investigates report that according to the data maintained by the Center for Responsive Politics Mulvaney's thirty one thousand seven hundred dollars in donations put some nice on the list of members of Congress receiving donations from the payday loan industry taking in more money than almost all House representatives and all but two senators so he is owned by the payday loan industry among the biggest contributors to his campaigns by the way also takes money from giant banks also regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and that's why he'd like to destroy it because his donors are not happy with it in fact one of those payday loan companies as we reported to you earlier told Donald Trump we want you to intercede on our behalf about a month ago when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau set laws that would protect consumers against these payday lenders and now the Trump administration is interceding now the new report is that it turns out Mulvaney's chief of staff recently resigned and you're not gonna believe where he's going to work it turns out he's now a lobbyist for the payday loan industry Wow look their corruption is so brazen the trope ran against the swamp and now they're like they're taking pictures of them swimming through the swamp having a good time you know having a party having drinks inside the swamp so let me tell you about this particular corner of the swamp al Simpson reportedly and he was the former chief of staff to Mulvaney reportedly got Mulvaney into politics as a south carolina state legislator has served as Mulvaney's chief of staff from 2010 through January of this year shortly before Mulvaney left Congress to take the helm at the Office of Management and Budget that month Simpson became a managing director of Washington lobbying powerhouse mercury public affairs hmm I wonder what mercury Public Affairs is going to get paid to do well let's find out as Jonathan Larson reports it CID investigates since that Simpson has registered as a lobbyist for seven companies three which are financial firms one of those firms is Harpeth financial services at payday lender which does business as advanced financial so he is of course hard at work trying to protect not consumers but the payday lenders that are ripping them off Simpson's registration formless only a single issue on which he anticipated lobbying for Harpeth and that is Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reform then he calls up his former boss because hey I got a great idea why don't you just take over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and light it on fire and then that way the lobbyist well he's the lobbyists the companies are paying me to lobby will get a great return on investment and by the way Ted look you hear you'll see how much he got paid in the month afterward according to Mercury's most recent disclosure form Harper's paid $10,000 for Simpson to lobby Congress and the office of administration about Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reform and look at how easily and cheap that they're bought so the former chief of staff of Mulvaney goes and becomes a lobbyist it's paid ten thousand dollars and he's like Oh okay we're not protecting consumers that's for sure okay they're trying to pass rules against payday lenders pay the atlanta's which are basically modern loan sharks their interest rates are in the hundreds of percents over 300 percent interest rates it's preposterous it's insane they there used to be laws against that at the state level there's still laws against that but they pay off national congressmen like Mulvaney who then go into the administration and their lobbyists they paid to them campaign contributions motivating $31,000 that's all it took to buy them the amount of money that is involved is billions of dollars the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau returned twelve billion dollars to you guys because of fraudulent schemes that banks and other financial institutions ran they were they were so fraudulent that even with their army of lawyers the banks said yeah you got us okay here's 12 billion dollars back that's how they protected you at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau now you pay off Mulvaney with $30,000 you pay off as chief of staff with $10,000 and they come in and they destroy the place that's the battle plan one last thing every once in a while you'll hear conservatives or Republicans say no it's okay it's okay we have full transparency no no we tell you who we're getting bribed by and and and and you know and then it's up to the voters right no there is no transparency here Simpsons forum that he's supposed to fill out as a lobbyist did not disclose that he used to serve as chief of staff to Mulvaney although the lobbying Disclosure Act requires lobbyists to disclose pass work for members of Congress Simpson's position as chief of staff is not listed even on forms filed for other clients disclosing he was lobbying Mulvaney's Office of Management and Budget directly so no there's no transparency they do take the legalized bribes they put it in their pockets and then they turn it and they don't tell you about it and then they pretend that they're honest actors and all of television goes oh there's a debate about what to do with the Protection Bureau there's a oh you know is financial regulation help to consumers or is deregulation the way to go maybe if we let the banks have no rules at all and no protect friend consumers have no protection at all that that might help the consumers I don't know it's an honest debate it's not an honest debate we legalized corruption in this country wolf dash pack.com to get the money out you need to pass an amendment otherwise these legalized criminals are gonna come in and rob you and that's what they're trying to do by destroying this agency so at least we caught our Simpson even though he did not do what was required by the law and figure in telling you who he actually worked for so now with the armed with that information you know you are you are at least understand what is going on here and a scam that's being played and if you voted for Trump thinking that he was gonna protect you from the global financial elites they're laughing their ass off at you the head of Goldman Sachs is now the top economic advisor for Donald Trump he's Treasury Secretary worked for Goldman Sachs he's got about five people in the West Wing that were from Goldman Sachs these payday lenders have now come in and bought off the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and they are laughing at you as we speak you won't get any more protection the unfortunately with no cops on this on the street particularly on Wall Street the robberies are about to go wild you just watch the video by The Young Turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a
