1
00:00:00,786 --> 00:00:02,385
- Megyn, we're so excited to have you.

2
00:00:02,385 --> 00:00:03,853
- Hi, excited to be here.

3
00:00:03,853 --> 00:00:06,077
- I don't think you need
much by way of introduction,

4
00:00:06,077 --> 00:00:08,736
but I will give just a couple points.

5
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:10,913
You got into journalism at 32,

6
00:00:10,913 --> 00:00:12,924
had been a lawyer in a previous life.

7
00:00:12,924 --> 00:00:14,719
12 years at FOX.

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,159
You now have two shows over at NBC.

9
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:19,793
One in the morning on the
Today Show hour at 9:00 a.m.

10
00:00:19,793 --> 00:00:22,200
Quite a morning for you I assume.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,254
And then you've done
a lot to shine a light

12
00:00:24,254 --> 00:00:26,864
on sexual harassment over
the years and on your show.

13
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:29,014
And you're not afraid
to reinvent yourself.

14
00:00:29,014 --> 00:00:30,171
So a lot to dive in,

15
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:32,314
but we gotta address the
elephant in the room first.

16
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:34,754
Matt Lauer, holy cow.

17
00:00:34,754 --> 00:00:36,686
When you woke up this morning did you know

18
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:38,255
that this was brewing?

19
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:39,787
What were your thoughts?

20
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:41,274
- No, I didn't.

21
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,727
You know, I --

22
00:00:42,727 --> 00:00:43,780
- [Alyson] Not at all?

23
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,110
Not like, Variety and New York Times

24
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,260
had been working on stories.

25
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,525
You don't hear about these things?

26
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:50,515
- So, I didn't have
any official knowledge.

27
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,924
But because of the work I
do and the stories I cover,

28
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:55,775
and the connections I
have in the industry,

29
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:57,927
I have a general feel for, I mean,

30
00:00:57,927 --> 00:01:00,669
I knew the Charlie Rose thing was coming.

31
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:02,452
And I had heard rumors about Matt.

32
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:04,018
But that's all they were.

33
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:05,693
My feeling on it was a
rumor is not the same

34
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:07,276
as reportable fact.

35
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:10,135
And it was also that
I hear a lot of rumors

36
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:12,384
about myself too that
are completely untrue,

37
00:01:12,384 --> 00:01:14,235
and when you're a public
figure, people do make up

38
00:01:14,235 --> 00:01:17,024
things about you and put them in print.

39
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:18,814
So I had no inside knowledge at all.

40
00:01:18,814 --> 00:01:21,689
But I knew people were
sniffing around the issue,

41
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,922
and hoped it wasn't true,

42
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:26,282
and wouldn't have been
surprised if none of that

43
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:29,070
had been materialized and he had a long

44
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,894
and enjoyable last
whatever, however many years

45
00:01:31,894 --> 00:01:34,228
he wanted to be at the Today Show.

46
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:36,215
- You said on your show this morning

47
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:37,791
it did hit close to home.

48
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,166
This is now a colleague of yours.

49
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,528
This is now the second
colleague of yours, at least,

50
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:43,277
who has had something like this happen.

51
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:44,329
- A third, really.

52
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:45,463
I mean, well, fourth.

53
00:01:45,463 --> 00:01:46,543
- [Alyson] Yeah, Bill O'Reilly.

54
00:01:46,543 --> 00:01:48,658
- Because looking back at FOX it's like

55
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:51,527
O'Reilly was a colleague,
Roger Ailes was my boss.

56
00:01:51,527 --> 00:01:54,328
Eric Bolling was a friend.

57
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:56,705
I'm losing track of all, but yeah, a lot.

58
00:01:56,705 --> 00:01:58,140
- So sad.

59
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,473
You've got quite enough experience
with this unfortunately,

60
00:02:01,473 --> 00:02:05,040
and as someone also who's
had it happen to them.

61
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,894
One thing that happened
to you is Roger Ailes

62
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,514
had been your boss and your mentor.

63
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:13,084
I believe he sounded really
supportive of you at the time.

64
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:14,496
He promoted you twice, I think,

65
00:02:14,496 --> 00:02:15,903
when you were on maternity leave.

66
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:17,319
- At least.

67
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,997
- And just saw you as a
star and helped you rise

68
00:02:18,997 --> 00:02:21,415
through FOX but then you
have this great mentor

69
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:24,328
who in your first year or two at FOX

70
00:02:24,328 --> 00:02:26,177
you say he sexually harassed you.

71
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:29,054
How did you cope with that as a woman

72
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:32,059
who had this happen to her?

73
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:36,121
- Well, I mean, he harassed me
early on in my tenure at FOX

74
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:37,956
and we got past it.

75
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:39,643
So those promotions and all that happened

76
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:41,627
after we got past it.

77
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:43,696
But I was scared when it happened to me.

78
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,360
I was second year reporter at FOX.

79
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,434
I wasn't the me that I am now.

80
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,314
I had no power in the industry at all.

81
00:02:50,314 --> 00:02:51,730
And no power at FOX News.

82
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,749
I was working the D.C. bureau,

83
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:55,332
and I was doing it.

84
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:58,599
I was doing well.

85
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,211
I was making my bones.

86
00:03:00,211 --> 00:03:02,741
I was reporting on big
cases at the Supreme Court

87
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:05,224
using my legal background, breaking news.

88
00:03:05,224 --> 00:03:08,291
The Duke alleged rape case
was a big case for me,

89
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,188
and I got that one right
and most reporters didn't.

90
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:12,742
It was good for me.

91
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:14,788
My career was going well.

92
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:18,065
So when he started it wasn't clear.

93
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,655
Like, he was always bawdy

94
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:21,923
and had an inappropriate sense of humor.

95
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:23,874
But I've never been, some
people feel differently,

96
00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:25,271
but I've never been somebody who really

97
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,104
takes offense at that.

98
00:03:28,111 --> 00:03:30,962
So I was quick to write
off the comments, like,

99
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:33,595
"Oh, that's just him."

100
00:03:33,595 --> 00:03:35,401
The harassment that I went through wasn't

101
00:03:35,401 --> 00:03:37,054
obviously harassment in the beginning,

102
00:03:37,054 --> 00:03:39,149
and then it graduated.

103
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:40,870
It just got worse and worse and worse,

104
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,934
to the point where you couldn't deny it.

105
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:46,195
It was explicit quid pro
quo sexual harassment,

106
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:48,017
which was basically,

107
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:50,283
you sleep with me and
I'll give you a promotion.

108
00:03:50,283 --> 00:03:53,638
And even in those moments
I tried to laugh it off,

109
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:55,631
and pretend I wasn't
hearing what I was hearing,

110
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:58,116
or try to pretend that
I had misunderstood,

111
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:01,800
because I didn't want a
direct confrontation with him.

112
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,941
I didn't want to have to
reject him explicitly,

113
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:06,785
and I think this is telling,

114
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:08,808
because a lot of women
to whom this happens

115
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:10,514
in the workplace have this calculation

116
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:11,958
where you're thinking,

117
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,863
"Holy you know what.

118
00:04:13,863 --> 00:04:15,717
"My whole job is on the line right now

119
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:20,196
"The last thing I want to do
is upset and reject my boss."

120
00:04:20,196 --> 00:04:21,687
We generally want to charm our bosses

121
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:24,979
and have them feel good about us.

122
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:28,621
And truly the culmination
of it was in his office,

123
00:04:28,621 --> 00:04:31,216
because when you'd go in
there and he'd shut the door

124
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:32,898
and he'd lock the door.

125
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,339
- [Alyson] That's terrifying.

126
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:36,680
- You would sort of shrug it off,

127
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,757
because he was known to be
very paranoid about security.

128
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:42,638
But that feeling I'll never forget

129
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:46,459
of going in there and
having him lock that door.

130
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:49,298
So it culminated in him trying
to be with me physically.

131
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:51,858
And it was only at that
point where you couldn't

132
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,960
pretend it wasn't happening anymore

133
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,647
that I really had to come to terms with it

134
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:58,394
and I ran out of the guys office

135
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:00,802
and he tried to grab me three times.

136
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:03,640
Make out with me, which he didn't.

137
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,198
But I had to shove him off of me.

138
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:06,216
And he came back.

139
00:05:06,216 --> 00:05:07,271
And I shoved him again,

140
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:08,589
and he came back a third time.

141
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:09,882
And then when I shoved
him off a third time

142
00:05:09,882 --> 00:05:11,843
he asked me when my contract was up.

143
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:13,513
- Oh my God.

144
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,600
Wow.

145
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,293
So how do you,

146
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:18,093
you clearly went on from that.

147
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:19,749
I think in your book you talk
about you distanced yourself

148
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:21,620
as much as you could from
him after he's saying --

149
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,321
- Well, I reported it to the supervisor

150
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:25,893
who told me just to stear clear of him,

151
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,277
which really at the time
seemed like good advice,

152
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:29,928
because it was a good
way to navigate forward.

153
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:33,511
But in retrospect was
terrible, terrible advice.

154
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:35,413
- You were in a powerless
position at the time.

155
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:37,659
When you finally did speak out about it

156
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:39,468
after other colleagues
starting talking about it,

157
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:41,394
you were in a powerful position.

158
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:43,510
A lot of women that are
having to come forward now

159
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,944
are not powerful and as you
talked about on your show

160
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:48,442
this morning you don't
see the pain that they're

161
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:51,412
going through as something
like Matt Lauer is addressed.

162
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:52,693
So what advice do you have for them

163
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:54,128
if they're scared to come forward

164
00:05:54,128 --> 00:05:56,288
if they're maybe not
in a powerful position?

165
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:57,570
- I understand that because I feel like

166
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,522
it's all well and good
for me to sit here now

167
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:01,770
in the position I now am in and say,

168
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,984
"Report it.

169
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:04,875
"Go to human resources."

170
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,533
Human resources was not an
option for me at all at FOX News.

171
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,180
It was entity completely
controlled by the CEO, Ailes,

172
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,680
who was my harasser.

173
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,393
I mean, it would have
been totally pointless.

174
00:06:14,393 --> 00:06:16,019
And I did report it to a
supervisor for that matter

175
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,011
who did nothing about it, predictably.

176
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:22,140
So I want to say to
those women I understand,

177
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,025
and it's not that I am
oblivious to how hard it is

178
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:27,942
to go report but I also
want to say find a way.

179
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:32,386
Because the culture, I don't
want to say has changed,

180
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:36,133
but it is changing
meaningfully by the moment

181
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:39,776
thanks to the women who
are finding the courage,

182
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:41,960
somehow who are finding the courage.

183
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,604
Let me tell you when this happens to you

184
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:46,431
by somebody's who's not
that much above you,

185
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:48,466
it's not as scary to report it.

186
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:49,972
The women who don't tend
to report are the ones

187
00:06:49,972 --> 00:06:52,129
who are very low on the totem pole

188
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:53,535
who are having it happen to them

189
00:06:53,535 --> 00:06:55,370
by somebody who's in a lot
of power who they know,

190
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,805
because they're not idiots,

191
00:06:56,805 --> 00:06:58,957
the company is likely to protect.

192
00:06:58,957 --> 00:07:02,419
They have a vested interest in this man.

193
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:04,453
And I think to those women
they need take a look

194
00:07:04,453 --> 00:07:06,846
at the broader culture
right now and see how

195
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:09,509
companies are being forced to respond,

196
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:12,409
and men who have been doing this

197
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:15,071
now have real skin in the game.

198
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:17,344
Look at the number of
men who have been fired.

199
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:20,030
Powerful men who are
considered indispensable.

200
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,637
We never would have thought Roger Ailes

201
00:07:21,637 --> 00:07:23,032
would have been fired by FOX News.

202
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:23,865
Ever.

203
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,951
Bill O'Reilly, he was
considered indispensable.

204
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:28,597
Wrong.

205
00:07:28,597 --> 00:07:31,171
Charlie Rose, on and on it goes.

206
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:33,315
So I think they have to find the courage

207
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:35,305
to seek somebody out and
if they can't make it be

208
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:37,378
someone in power, someone
with real responsibility

209
00:07:37,378 --> 00:07:40,714
at the company, go to someone like me.

210
00:07:40,714 --> 00:07:42,578
Someone who maybe doesn't have a mandatory

211
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:44,551
reporting obligation within the company,

212
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:46,299
but who would be there to advise you.

213
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,076
And let me tell you, if a
woman came to me at NBC News

214
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:49,734
and said this is happened
to me by somebody,

215
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,459
A, I would advise her on what to do,

216
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:54,496
B, I would work it behind the scenes.

217
00:07:54,496 --> 00:07:56,875
Even if I had to go into
the bosses office and say

218
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,888
here's a name, go investigate.

219
00:07:58,888 --> 00:08:00,667
You have to do some sort of looking.

220
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,127
I'm not gonna tell you who reported it.

221
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:03,701
I don't have to.

222
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:06,081
But I think powerful
women need to be there

223
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:09,088
for less powerful women
so that they can grow

224
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,346
into powerful women so
that they're not scared

225
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:13,721
out of the workforce or
effectively shoved out

226
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:16,551
because so often what we
see is a woman gets moved.

227
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:18,949
Suddenly her work product
isn't as good, right.

228
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:20,830
She chooses to leave
because she doesn't want

229
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,963
to live like that.

230
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:26,282
So these companies are
bleeding awesome female talent,

231
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:29,026
because women don't want
to deal with this nonsense.

232
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:30,493
So if it gets to the point
where they just can't

233
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:32,187
take it anymore and they don't feel like

234
00:08:32,187 --> 00:08:36,034
there's any meaningful
avenue, they'll leave.

235
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:37,885
- I could talk to you
about this the entire time,

236
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,328
but there's so much other ground to cover.

237
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:41,136
So I want to transition a little bit.

238
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:42,958
Still a little bit on
the harassment lines,

239
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,508
you were a subject of this but,

240
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:47,305
the last two years for you,

241
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:49,896
I want to go back to
the August 2015 debate,

242
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:53,119
the first presidential debate
when you asked this question

243
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:56,374
that rocked the world
and sent ripple effects.

244
00:08:56,374 --> 00:08:58,530
And I want to set the scene
for it a little bit too.

245
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,802
You and Trump had had some
interactions the week prior.

246
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:03,262
He seemed nervous about you.

247
00:09:03,262 --> 00:09:05,658
He had actually hung up
the phone on you that week.

248
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:07,159
He had been calling
your bosses being like,

249
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,803
"What's Megyn gonna do in the debate?"

250
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:10,960
Were you worried about that night

251
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,789
knowing what you were gonna
be asking him about women?

252
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:17,594
- I mean, I could feel a storm coming.

253
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:19,067
That's how it felt.

254
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:20,563
He was angry with me and he yelled at me

255
00:09:20,563 --> 00:09:23,774
and hung up on me the Monday
before that Thursday debate

256
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:26,495
because of a segment I
had done on the Kelly File

257
00:09:26,495 --> 00:09:29,524
about his alleged rape of Ivana Trump.

258
00:09:29,524 --> 00:09:31,094
A story that had been
reported in the news,

259
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:32,639
it was based on her sworn
deposition testimony

260
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,176
saying he had raped her.

261
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:37,302
And then she later recanted.

262
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:40,009
Anyway, this was made
an issue in the press

263
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:41,806
in the course of his presidential run,

264
00:09:41,806 --> 00:09:43,638
and we covered it on the Kelly File,

265
00:09:43,638 --> 00:09:45,350
which he was not happy about.

266
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,835
So he called me up and yelled
at me and screamed at me,

267
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:48,085
and ba, ba, ba.

268
00:09:49,014 --> 00:09:51,841
My question that I asked
that night about women

269
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,590
had long been in the bank.

270
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,930
It wasn't like I wrote
that after he yelled at me.

271
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,597
But it certainly did

272
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:02,301
make me realize he's already angry,

273
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,932
and he's not gonna like this question.

274
00:10:05,932 --> 00:10:07,682
But what can you do?

275
00:10:07,682 --> 00:10:08,604
You're a journalist.

276
00:10:08,604 --> 00:10:10,493
Sometimes you make people angry.

277
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:12,994
- So you asked and it has,

278
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:15,013
Trump's clearly not happy.

279
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:18,156
He goes and talks about you
bleeding out of wherever.

280
00:10:18,156 --> 00:10:22,284
His lawyer tweets about you
being gutted or gutting her.

281
00:10:22,284 --> 00:10:24,084
- We can gut her.

282
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:27,724
- Tell me about what the
weeks and months were like

283
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:31,217
being as Maureen Dowd
put it, Trump's chew toy.

284
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:33,660
(audience chuckles)

285
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,209
- I know you're laughing,

286
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:36,823
but I really don't like that.

287
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:38,071
I didn't like that.

288
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:38,904
At all.

289
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:41,684
And objected,

290
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,566
I didn't like the way she phrased it.

291
00:10:44,566 --> 00:10:45,851
It was bullshit.

292
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:47,984
Can you swear here?

293
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:48,817
I wasn't.

294
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:51,788
I never backed down from him.

295
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:55,010
I never stopped covering him fairly,

296
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,061
the controversies he generated.

297
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:58,956
I never was cowed out of fear,

298
00:10:58,956 --> 00:11:00,366
even though the security threats

299
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:02,817
in my life went like this.

300
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:05,563
And my children's lives like this.

301
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:07,717
And it was hard to go out
there night after night

302
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:10,239
and do that and find the
courage to cover him fairly,

303
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:11,735
but not over correct
to the point where you

304
00:11:11,735 --> 00:11:13,452
bashed him because he was coming after you

305
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:16,499
and causing this issue in your life.

306
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:18,867
I was not his chew toy.

307
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:21,446
He continued to try to bully me,

308
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:23,306
and I call it an attempted bullying,

309
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:26,028
because an effective
bullying causes change

310
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:27,785
in the other persons behavior.

311
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:28,618
He didn't.

312
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:34,182
And at the end of nine
months of relentless,

313
00:11:34,182 --> 00:11:37,599
relentless attacks over a hundred tweets,

314
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:43,429
the guy, Dan Scavino,
who's now the White House

315
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:45,661
Director of Social Media,

316
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:48,397
who was relentless too and
orchestrated a campaign

317
00:11:48,397 --> 00:11:50,918
against me online, Michael Cohen,

318
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,855
who's the one who's Trump's lawyer,

319
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:54,595
he's now working for
the President, who said,

320
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:56,386
"We can gut her."

321
00:11:56,386 --> 00:11:58,520
I mean, tens of thousands
of people he's tweeting,

322
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,896
"We can gut her"

323
00:11:59,896 --> 00:12:03,487
when there's a fever
pitch already against me.

324
00:12:03,487 --> 00:12:04,996
It wouldn't stop.

325
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:07,316
Nothing would stop the behavior.

326
00:12:07,316 --> 00:12:09,566
He never could get past it.

327
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:12,684
And finally I decided to
take the situation in hand

328
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:15,996
and go right to Trump
Tower and stand him down,

329
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:17,596
which is what I did.

330
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:19,435
- Right, but that's after
your daughter, I think,

331
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:20,594
your daughter came to you and said,

332
00:12:20,594 --> 00:12:22,538
"Mom, what's a bimbo?"

333
00:12:22,538 --> 00:12:23,736
and asked you,

334
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:25,524
"Does Donald Trump want to hurt you?"

335
00:12:25,524 --> 00:12:28,710
and you had people showing
up at your door at your home.

336
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,252
Your family's security is at stake.

337
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:32,419
That must have been awful.

338
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:36,452
- The Yardley moment was maybe
the lowest moment of all.

339
00:12:36,452 --> 00:12:37,902
It was one of the lowest moments.

340
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:39,029
- [Alyson] And Yardley is your daughter.

341
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:39,862
- She's my daughter.

342
00:12:39,862 --> 00:12:41,482
She's six now.

343
00:12:41,482 --> 00:12:44,208
We didn't share with our kids
at all any of his nonsense,

344
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,933
because they have enough to worry about,

345
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,800
and worrying about presidential politics

346
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,084
and certainly not anything involving me

347
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:52,669
and the possible president.

348
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:54,269
But they heard things.

349
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:56,460
They live in this world.

350
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,714
Yardley came home one day and asked me,

351
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:01,131
"What's a bimbo?"

352
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,995
'Cause he had tweeted that out about me.

353
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:08,513
The thing about it that was so devastating

354
00:13:08,513 --> 00:13:11,691
is a year earlier, not a
year, but not long earlier,

355
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,655
I can't remember exactly the timing,

356
00:13:13,655 --> 00:13:14,969
but I had taken her with me to Fortune

357
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:17,213
Most Powerful Women Conference,

358
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:21,921
and she said to me on the
train ride down there,

359
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:23,569
"What is this thing we're going to?"

360
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,505
And I said,

361
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:26,167
"This is a conference that talks about

362
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:28,061
"really powerful women
who've done great things

363
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:29,899
"and celebrates them."

364
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:30,923
And she looked at me and said,

365
00:13:30,923 --> 00:13:32,673
"Are we two of them?"

366
00:13:35,904 --> 00:13:39,640
I thought about the loss
that my child had suffered

367
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,666
without even knowing it
of going from thinking

368
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:46,113
she was at five, or four at the time,

369
00:13:46,113 --> 00:13:48,974
a Fortune Most Powerful Woman,

370
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:51,391
to asking me what a bimbo is.

371
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:55,828
To this moment it's painful.

372
00:13:55,828 --> 00:13:58,731
It's not, listen, I can take,
a lot of people call me names.

373
00:13:58,731 --> 00:14:00,474
I can take it.

374
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:02,265
But there was a loss in that moment.

375
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:03,848
She lost something.

376
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:09,704
Every time a man, whether
it is our president,

377
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:13,621
or a news anchor, demeans
or diminishes a woman

378
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:18,480
by grabbing her ass or
talking about her body,

379
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,526
or coming on to her instead
of asking for her ideas

380
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:24,428
and treating her like a professional

381
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:28,532
in the workplace setting,
they lose something too.

382
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:30,930
It's not a small matter.

383
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,347
It's a huge deal.

384
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:37,414
It's been happening
systemically for far too long.

385
00:14:37,414 --> 00:14:39,257
I feel like this is the first moment

386
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:41,208
we're starting to think maybe it doesn't

387
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,355
have to keep happening.

388
00:14:43,355 --> 00:14:46,578
Maybe we won't be "the
nice" women and girls

389
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:48,958
we've been raised to be.

390
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,519
That is what is prized
among women and young girls.

391
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,352
Niceness.

392
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:54,936
Go along to get along.

393
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,659
Don't cause waves.

394
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:58,571
Enough of that.

395
00:14:58,571 --> 00:14:59,821
Enough of that.

396
00:15:00,658 --> 00:15:02,596
- You're talking about
that a lot on your show,

397
00:15:02,596 --> 00:15:05,875
and using that to power
the empowerment revolution

398
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,555
as I think you like to say.

399
00:15:07,555 --> 00:15:10,150
But I want to talk about
how you came to NBC.

400
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,042
You come off this very tough year

401
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:17,402
being the subject of a
hundred Trump tweets,

402
00:15:17,402 --> 00:15:19,825
and you realize what?

403
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:21,711
What was it about FOX
that made you be like,

404
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:22,544
"I need something else.

405
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:23,795
"I want something new."

406
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:25,853
NBC is a big change.

407
00:15:25,853 --> 00:15:27,774
- It was a combination of a lot of things.

408
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:30,784
First and foremost I was not
seeing my children grow up.

409
00:15:30,784 --> 00:15:33,233
I would leave for work at 3:00, 3:30,

410
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,107
which is exactly when your
kids get home from school.

411
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:39,292
They had aged into that school schedule.

412
00:15:39,292 --> 00:15:40,649
When I started the Kelly File they were

413
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,968
four, three, and newborn.

414
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:44,639
By the time I left they were

415
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,898
two out of three in school 'til 3:00.

416
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:48,419
So I wasn't seeing them.

417
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:50,315
I wasn't seeing two out
of my three children

418
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:52,572
Monday through Friday
except for that 45 minutes

419
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:54,216
in the morning where
you're just yell at them

420
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:56,816
to get their backpack and
their sneakers and get out.

421
00:15:56,816 --> 00:15:59,068
Which is not meaningful.

422
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:00,522
So I wasn't happy.

423
00:16:00,522 --> 00:16:02,119
It wasn't good enough.

424
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:03,433
I'm fine being a working parent.

425
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:04,560
I need to be a working parent.

426
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,272
I love my work.

427
00:16:06,272 --> 00:16:07,604
That wasn't good enough.

428
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:09,534
The balance had tipped too far.

429
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:11,096
Professionally, I really felt like

430
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,124
there was no more growth
for me at FOX News.

431
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:17,287
That I had done all the
things I wanted to do there.

432
00:16:17,287 --> 00:16:18,896
- I would press you on,

433
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,680
I think a lot of people
would say that right now

434
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,502
is the most important time in
history of American politics.

435
00:16:23,502 --> 00:16:26,090
And you were seen as a leader.

436
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,311
You had this great following on FOX.

437
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:32,025
You have the bases ear watching your show.

438
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,498
Why take yourself out
of politics right now?

439
00:16:34,498 --> 00:16:35,671
Don't you think the world needs more

440
00:16:35,671 --> 00:16:38,500
of that hard-hitting journalism?

441
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,310
- I'm all for hard-hitting journalism.

442
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,371
However, I do feel that
in the era of Trump

443
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:44,115
you might as well go stand
on the edge of the Pacific

444
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:47,568
and scream at the top of
your lungs all day every day.

445
00:16:47,568 --> 00:16:48,902
- [Alyson] Um, okay.

446
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:50,524
- I can tell you..

447
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:52,173
(audience chuckles)

448
00:16:52,173 --> 00:16:55,000
Truly, I anchored on the FOX
News Channel at 9:00 p.m.,

449
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,144
one of, if not the most
powerful time slot there,

450
00:16:58,144 --> 00:17:01,823
for a full year and I covered
every controversy of his

451
00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:04,490
earnestly and in a tough manner.

452
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,666
From the Gold Star family, Judge Curiel,

453
00:17:09,723 --> 00:17:12,049
women, you name it, right.

454
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,953
I was the first to call
out his misogyny publicly.

455
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:18,087
Did it do any good?

456
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:19,681
Were hearts and minds changed?

457
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:21,438
Was there an available audience to me

458
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:23,443
at the FOX News channel of Republicans

459
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,846
and Independents and
Democrats who are open minded

460
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:28,346
who were there for persuading?

461
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:30,526
You tell me.

462
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:34,075
It's not to say that there's no value

463
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:35,261
in political journalism.

464
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:37,311
I do believe that journalists
are the first draft historians

465
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:39,425
and there's value in that.

466
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:43,592
But if you are covering politics
to try to persuade people,

467
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:47,670
which is what I think
people wanted me to do,

468
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,523
you're wasting your time.

469
00:17:49,523 --> 00:17:52,446
The Trump voters are dug in on Trump.

470
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,529
The Trump haters are dug in on Trump.

471
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:58,445
There's so much that goes into

472
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,858
their very strong views on him,

473
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:03,510
and frankly I thought to myself

474
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,367
I could also get into a bath every morning

475
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:09,578
of carcinogens and just
roll around in it all day,

476
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:12,556
but that's not good for me either.

477
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:14,599
I really, my whole feeling,

478
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,090
it's not just Trump,

479
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,909
my feeling on the
beltway on political news

480
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:22,826
is the folks inside the
beltway are dead to us.

481
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,945
We have to forge on without them.

482
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:29,398
The leaders, to me, nine times out of ten

483
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:33,045
are feckless and spineless
and often controlled

484
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,223
by big money interests
and don't seem to have

485
00:18:36,223 --> 00:18:38,838
any real appetite anymore
for getting things done

486
00:18:38,838 --> 00:18:40,724
or reaching across the aisle
or reaching compromises

487
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:42,304
that work for the American people.

488
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:44,682
We have to do an end around.

489
00:18:44,682 --> 00:18:48,849
I would love to be part of
raising powerful boys and girls,

490
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,865
sending messages out into
the world and our country

491
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:56,178
that are more positive and inspirational

492
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,967
and aspirational and
celebrating the people

493
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:00,859
who have had challenges in their own lives

494
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:02,827
and showing people a
way to deal with them.

495
00:19:02,827 --> 00:19:04,780
That, I think, has value.

496
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,929
That is not screaming into the Pacific.

497
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:10,038
So I admire those who do
it, don't get me wrong.

498
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:11,219
It's hard.

499
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:12,778
It's harder than it's ever been

500
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:14,460
to be in political journalism.

501
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,394
I tip my hat to my colleagues who do it,

502
00:19:16,394 --> 00:19:18,061
and I know them all.

503
00:19:19,464 --> 00:19:22,230
But I can see on most of them

504
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,730
the wear and tear,

505
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:30,155
how hard it is and how
not rewarding right now.

506
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,808
- It sounds like
screaming into the Pacific

507
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:36,518
it almost felt like a helpless situation

508
00:19:36,518 --> 00:19:37,790
no matter what you said.

509
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,434
- I would never use that
word about me or my life.

510
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:42,257
- Right, well, fair.

511
00:19:42,257 --> 00:19:44,406
But at NBC you're trying,

512
00:19:44,406 --> 00:19:46,895
it sounds like you're hoping
to reach the core of America

513
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,746
and influence their values
and do that with your show.

514
00:19:49,746 --> 00:19:53,369
Has it been, you've
interviewed Trump, Putin,

515
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:55,312
dealt with all sorts of things.

516
00:19:55,312 --> 00:19:56,302
- Big Bird.

517
00:19:56,302 --> 00:19:57,345
- Big Bird, of course.

518
00:19:57,345 --> 00:19:59,036
- The full range.

519
00:19:59,036 --> 00:20:01,858
- Has it been harder than you
thought to do a morning show

520
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:04,813
where things are happy
and cheery and lighter?

521
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:06,586
- No, it hasn't been hard.

522
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:09,824
I don't really think about
challenges in my life as hard.

523
00:20:09,824 --> 00:20:12,477
I don't think that's helpful thinking.

524
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,265
I like challenges.

525
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:17,304
I said to my husband when I
was thinking about leaving FOX

526
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:19,431
that we were actually in Lake Placid,

527
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:20,561
we were hiking up this mountain.

528
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:21,521
It was a small mountain.

529
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,347
I'm not an exerciser.

530
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,678
But we got to the top and I said,

531
00:20:25,678 --> 00:20:27,857
I was thinking about
do I leave, do I stay?

532
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:28,690
And I said,

533
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,661
"You know, sometimes the
ascent is more enjoyable

534
00:20:32,661 --> 00:20:35,009
"than being at the summit."

535
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:36,766
Building something, creating something,

536
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:39,136
building new muscles, growing.

537
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:41,303
And that's what I'm doing.

538
00:20:42,837 --> 00:20:47,011
My friends who know me,
they see the me they know

539
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:49,158
on the Today Show.

540
00:20:49,158 --> 00:20:51,225
People who only knew me
from snip-its of FOX News

541
00:20:51,225 --> 00:20:53,331
think I'm all sharp elbows,

542
00:20:53,331 --> 00:20:56,654
and I have them and I can
use them and I still will.

543
00:20:56,654 --> 00:20:58,555
But that's not all of me.

544
00:20:58,555 --> 00:21:00,913
And I actually think it's
been a very sexist meme

545
00:21:00,913 --> 00:21:02,769
for people to suggest
that because you can throw

546
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:04,752
a sharp elbow when necessary

547
00:21:04,752 --> 00:21:07,106
that you have no softness to you.

548
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:09,103
I would submit that is not true of me,

549
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:10,709
nor any woman I know,

550
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:13,332
nor any man for that matter.

551
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:15,898
So for me, it's been a delight,

552
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:17,544
because I have this platform where I can

553
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:20,195
tap into the other pieces of me

554
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,667
and if you need to be hard-hitting

555
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:23,057
in any given interview, and
I've already had a couple

556
00:21:23,057 --> 00:21:25,453
of those on my show, you can be.

557
00:21:25,453 --> 00:21:27,335
But I also have these other venues at NBC

558
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:29,822
that will allow me to
do political journalism.

559
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,968
I'll be on air for NBC on
the big political nights.

560
00:21:32,968 --> 00:21:35,147
And on the Sunday Show where I did Putin,

561
00:21:35,147 --> 00:21:37,382
and all that's still fair game.

562
00:21:37,382 --> 00:21:40,056
It's just my focus is
on something that I hope

563
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:43,954
is more uplifting than
this stoking of outrage

564
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:46,454
you get in political coverage.

565
00:21:50,414 --> 00:21:52,679
- If you were hoping to
not be the story anymore,

566
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,659
I think that that has not happened.

567
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,231
You are constantly in the news.

568
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,356
- Let's see that point.

569
00:21:57,356 --> 00:21:58,967
- You have a very big fan at Jezebel

570
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:00,309
who writes about you quite often

571
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:01,142
and you invited --

572
00:22:01,142 --> 00:22:02,094
- Bobby Finger.

573
00:22:02,094 --> 00:22:03,413
- Yes, yes, your favorite.

574
00:22:03,413 --> 00:22:06,652
And he came on your show and
it was kind of a funny moment,

575
00:22:06,652 --> 00:22:09,417
but how do you deal with the criticism

576
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:12,765
and the ratings talk and
is there pressure from NBC

577
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,502
to really nail this morning hour?

578
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,652
- They've been great.

579
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:18,373
NBC has put zero pressure on me.

580
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:20,306
I've only felt supported by them.

581
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:21,978
You know, we're little babies.

582
00:22:21,978 --> 00:22:25,705
We're like a little nine
week old baby on my show,

583
00:22:25,705 --> 00:22:27,466
and so we're getting it going, you know.

584
00:22:27,466 --> 00:22:29,771
It's like right now we're
starting to find our voice,

585
00:22:29,771 --> 00:22:32,341
hit our stride, things are growing.

586
00:22:32,341 --> 00:22:35,228
So I feel good about it and
they feel good about it.

587
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,152
They've done nothing
other than support me.

588
00:22:38,152 --> 00:22:40,212
Criticism, it's part of the game.

589
00:22:40,212 --> 00:22:41,412
I'm not gonna lie.

590
00:22:41,412 --> 00:22:42,651
It isn't pleasant.

591
00:22:42,651 --> 00:22:44,541
It's not like I'm some,
I'm impervious to it.

592
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,651
I'm just this, I'm fine.

593
00:22:46,651 --> 00:22:49,993
I cry, I hold my husband and say,

594
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,576
"Why does it have to be so hard?

595
00:22:51,576 --> 00:22:53,423
"Why does it have to be this way?"

596
00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:55,829
But then I pick myself
up, dust myself off,

597
00:22:55,829 --> 00:23:00,023
and just do the damn job and
that's what you have to do.

598
00:23:00,023 --> 00:23:02,149
If you go through it enough
times it does get easier,

599
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:04,369
which is what I want to tell others.

600
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:07,025
So if a big crisis hits you in your life,

601
00:23:07,025 --> 00:23:08,803
or you find yourself on the receiving end

602
00:23:08,803 --> 00:23:09,900
of great criticism,

603
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,067
whether it's as public as I
have or some other amount,

604
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:18,145
you should welcome it because
it's an opportunity to grow.

605
00:23:18,145 --> 00:23:19,994
You will emerge out
the other side stronger

606
00:23:19,994 --> 00:23:22,883
than when you began and
there's value in that.

607
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:25,122
- You are not someone who's
afraid to speak your mind,

608
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:26,594
to do what you believe is right,

609
00:23:26,594 --> 00:23:28,187
even if it is unpopular.

610
00:23:28,187 --> 00:23:30,246
At times it is, and at times you've been

611
00:23:30,246 --> 00:23:31,622
proven really right.

612
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:33,813
So I would say one of
those moments is Alex Jones

613
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:37,455
had a lot of flack for interviewing him,

614
00:23:37,455 --> 00:23:39,435
and then the interview came
out and people were like,

615
00:23:39,435 --> 00:23:41,954
"Oh, this is actually
important journalism."

616
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:45,208
You had a moment on FOX News
where you defended women

617
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:47,687
in the workplace to the
point where a stranger

618
00:23:47,687 --> 00:23:49,990
named Sheryl Sandberg
called you up and said,

619
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,550
"I love you" which is amazing.

620
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,926
But you've also had moments where,

621
00:23:54,926 --> 00:23:56,850
when you're constantly speaking your mind,

622
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,142
you're gonna say things
that don't always resonate

623
00:23:58,142 --> 00:23:59,338
or people don't agree with.

624
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:00,842
I think one notable one is

625
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:03,680
Santa is white on FOX as a moment.

626
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,936
The first week of your show
there were a few statements

627
00:24:05,936 --> 00:24:08,097
that rubbed people the
wrong way about Jane Fonda

628
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:11,402
and plastic surgery and things like that.

629
00:24:11,402 --> 00:24:13,856
Upon further reflection
do you regret anything

630
00:24:13,856 --> 00:24:18,023
that you've said out there
and is Santa still white?

631
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:20,870
- I regret a lot of what I've said.

632
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,786
I mean you're gonna be on
the air several hours a week,

633
00:24:23,786 --> 00:24:27,604
live television, you're
gonna say stupid shit.

634
00:24:27,604 --> 00:24:30,023
That's just the reality.

635
00:24:30,023 --> 00:24:31,934
So yeah, there's a lot I'd like to go back

636
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:33,601
and say differently.

637
00:24:35,506 --> 00:24:38,848
All I can tell you is I think
the lens is a truth teller.

638
00:24:38,848 --> 00:24:40,403
And people who watch you day after day

639
00:24:40,403 --> 00:24:44,672
will see who you are without
the caricature of you

640
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:46,088
that's put out there by websites

641
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:48,338
and so on looming over you.

642
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,435
You know, one of my great struggles at FOX

643
00:24:55,435 --> 00:24:57,913
was I felt everything I
did was viewed through

644
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,916
a negative prism by
those who didn't like FOX

645
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,906
or what it stands for.

646
00:25:02,906 --> 00:25:05,075
And I hated that.

647
00:25:05,075 --> 00:25:06,711
I think there's a lot of people over there

648
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:09,756
who are good people and
solid journalists who I love,

649
00:25:09,756 --> 00:25:12,000
who struggle with that.

650
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,090
And I'm sure people at other
stations have the same thing.

651
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,895
People have a world view
about certain journalists

652
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:19,101
or their organizations.

653
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,958
I really hope that in my new position

654
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:25,585
people will just see me for who I am

655
00:25:25,585 --> 00:25:27,835
and not through that prism.

656
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:31,753
So far I feel like it's happening,

657
00:25:31,753 --> 00:25:33,270
but I feel like time will tell.

658
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,524
You'll see me and you'll
figure out who I am

659
00:25:35,524 --> 00:25:38,345
and then people will accept or not accept

660
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:42,093
based on what they see and
that's all I can ask for anybody.

661
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:44,943
- I want to, like I said, I
could talk to you for hours.

662
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,348
But we don't have that much time,

663
00:25:46,348 --> 00:25:49,038
so I just want to wrap it up
with your philosophy on life.

664
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:51,698
You wrote a best seller
called "Settle For More."

665
00:25:51,698 --> 00:25:54,528
It came from when you were a lawyer.

666
00:25:54,528 --> 00:25:56,410
You were a high-powered
lawyer on track to become

667
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:59,602
a partner in your early 30s
and you watched Dr. Phil

668
00:25:59,602 --> 00:26:02,693
on Oprah and he said something
that really just resonates.

669
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:06,679
What was that and then how
did you put it to action?

670
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:07,706
- He said,

671
00:26:07,706 --> 00:26:09,966
"The only difference between
you and someone you envy

672
00:26:09,966 --> 00:26:12,549
"is that you settled for less."

673
00:26:14,043 --> 00:26:15,704
And honestly I resolved in that moment

674
00:26:15,704 --> 00:26:16,882
that I would settle for more,

675
00:26:16,882 --> 00:26:18,014
that I would change my life.

676
00:26:18,014 --> 00:26:19,158
I had been a very unhappy lawyer.

677
00:26:19,158 --> 00:26:20,325
I had no life.

678
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:24,018
I didn't understand,

679
00:26:24,018 --> 00:26:25,906
I became a lawyer because I really thought

680
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:28,356
that it would help
people take me seriously.

681
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:30,071
I thought it was somehow
gonna legitimize me

682
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:32,583
to have an Esq. after my name.

683
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,356
And it did to some extent, it did.

684
00:26:34,356 --> 00:26:35,773
But at what cost?

685
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:38,492
I wasn't happy.

686
00:26:39,622 --> 00:26:43,789
After 9/11, I was in Chicago
for 9/11 practicing law

687
00:26:44,992 --> 00:26:47,301
and I saw these journalists
out there on the street

688
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:50,398
at great risk to themselves
reporting the news

689
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:54,398
fairly, professionally,
appropriately, humanely.

690
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:58,269
Like they didn't lose
their humanity in doing it,

691
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:00,926
but they also weren't making
the story about themselves.

692
00:27:00,926 --> 00:27:03,550
I just thought wow, I admire them.

693
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,985
I admire them.

694
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:06,886
And I had always thought
about broadcast journalism,

695
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:10,196
and I was feeling of the
reporters a certain kind of envy

696
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:13,279
of their doing a public service to me

697
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:17,235
right now as a viewer watching this.

698
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,069
So it was after that I heard Dr. Phil,

699
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:21,068
and my life was miserable.

700
00:27:21,068 --> 00:27:22,502
And I decided to settle for more

701
00:27:22,502 --> 00:27:25,285
and just try something else.

702
00:27:25,285 --> 00:27:26,704
And it worked out.

703
00:27:26,704 --> 00:27:28,118
I didn't know anybody in journalism.

704
00:27:28,118 --> 00:27:29,444
I didn't have any connections.

705
00:27:29,444 --> 00:27:32,348
I didn't come from a family
with connections of any kind.

706
00:27:32,348 --> 00:27:36,045
But there was a woman named
Meredith in my guitar class

707
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:39,322
and as it turned out not long after that

708
00:27:39,322 --> 00:27:40,713
she wasn't there.

709
00:27:40,713 --> 00:27:42,641
I found out it was because
she worked at WMAQ,

710
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:45,998
the Chicago NBC O&O and I said,

711
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,736
"Oh my God, you're in news.

712
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:49,791
"Can I take you out for a cup of coffee?"

713
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:52,025
And she said yes and she
helped me make a resume tape,

714
00:27:52,025 --> 00:27:56,131
which is what you need to get
an on-air job as a reporter,

715
00:27:56,131 --> 00:27:58,131
and the rest is history.

716
00:27:59,877 --> 00:28:01,963
- So you've become
extremely successful at,

717
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:03,621
I think you own a green
t-shirt I read that says,

718
00:28:03,621 --> 00:28:05,315
"I want it all."

719
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:07,117
I would say that you do.

720
00:28:07,117 --> 00:28:10,295
To quote this good friend now
of yours, Dr. Phil, he said,

721
00:28:10,295 --> 00:28:11,853
"Successful lawyer, top journalist,

722
00:28:11,853 --> 00:28:13,919
"wife, mother of three, if that's a bimbo,

723
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,457
"I hope all of my granddaughters
grow up to be bimbos."

724
00:28:16,457 --> 00:28:18,500
(laughter)

725
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,970
So now that you do have
it all are you happy?

726
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,178
Are you exhausted?

727
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:24,083
Is it possible to become too successful?

728
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:26,333
- Happy and exhausted, yes.

729
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,466
I would say I'm as happy as
an Irish Catholic can be.

730
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:30,517
I don't know.

731
00:28:30,517 --> 00:28:31,858
(laughter)

732
00:28:31,858 --> 00:28:34,804
There's a lot of guilt. (chuckles)

733
00:28:34,804 --> 00:28:36,197
I am happy.

734
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:37,651
I am.

735
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:40,027
It like my happiness doesn't revolve

736
00:28:40,027 --> 00:28:44,664
so much around my job, although
my job right now is joyful.

737
00:28:44,664 --> 00:28:47,940
It revolves around the
core people in my life

738
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,754
who make me me, who help make me me.

739
00:28:50,754 --> 00:28:54,849
So your job, I think, it can
drive you to unhappiness.

740
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:56,827
I've certainly seen that and
it can stir up your happiness,

741
00:28:56,827 --> 00:28:59,608
like maybe take it up a notch or two.

742
00:28:59,608 --> 00:29:01,291
But I am happy because I have Doug

743
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,043
and I have my three children,

744
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:06,090
and I have my good friends,

745
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,596
and they make me feel connected

746
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:09,827
to other human beings in this world.

747
00:29:09,827 --> 00:29:11,608
My children make me feel hopeful.

748
00:29:11,608 --> 00:29:15,982
My husband makes me feel
connected and supported.

749
00:29:15,982 --> 00:29:17,738
That's what I need.

750
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:19,338
To me, it's very empowering,

751
00:29:19,338 --> 00:29:21,732
because I feel like whether
it was my job at FOX,

752
00:29:21,732 --> 00:29:23,695
my job at NBC, my job as a lawyer,

753
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,178
none of that has power over me.

754
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:29,518
I don't lie awake at night
worrying about that stuff

755
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:33,473
because it can come and it
can go and I'll be just fine.

756
00:29:33,473 --> 00:29:37,316
I am still here and I have
my people and I have myself,

757
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:40,641
and I believe in what I stand for,

758
00:29:40,641 --> 00:29:44,061
and I know who I am because
I've been self-reflective

759
00:29:44,061 --> 00:29:45,370
and I've thought about it.

760
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,370
I've tried to be better.

761
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,824
I think too often we give too much power

762
00:29:50,824 --> 00:29:54,052
to the things that drive our ego.

763
00:29:54,052 --> 00:29:57,923
I think one of the blessings
of the launch of my show,

764
00:29:57,923 --> 00:30:00,767
which has not been without
some bumps in the road,

765
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:03,277
has been the joy I've felt
for the past nine weeks,

766
00:30:03,277 --> 00:30:07,893
because I think it's a tell
that my happiness is real.

767
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:09,815
It is connected to the work I'm doing

768
00:30:09,815 --> 00:30:12,539
and the people I've
surrounded myself with.

769
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,837
There's not some outside
ego-driven thing happening

770
00:30:14,837 --> 00:30:18,797
of my power or my reach or my whatever.

771
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:21,147
It isn't about the money or
the ratings or any of that.

772
00:30:21,147 --> 00:30:23,397
It is about the way I feel.

773
00:30:24,453 --> 00:30:25,943
The same way they say you
know who your friends are

774
00:30:25,943 --> 00:30:28,200
by the way you feel
when you're around them.

775
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,288
I feel like you know whether you've made

776
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:32,657
the right life choices by the way you feel

777
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:34,503
when you're around those choices.

778
00:30:34,503 --> 00:30:37,388
When I am around my
NBC family and my show,

779
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:39,262
I feel great.

780
00:30:39,262 --> 00:30:40,810
I feel like this.

781
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,234
I really do.

782
00:30:42,234 --> 00:30:43,803
When I'm around my
husband I feel like this,

783
00:30:43,803 --> 00:30:44,712
and it wasn't always thus.

784
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:45,886
I used to be married to somebody else

785
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,298
and it didn't work out.

786
00:30:48,298 --> 00:30:49,929
It was part of settling for more,

787
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:51,857
and he wound up married
to a woman he loves

788
00:30:51,857 --> 00:30:53,160
and they have three children too.

789
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,815
So it worked out well for both of us.

790
00:30:55,815 --> 00:30:58,274
But I think it believes
with an honest gut check.

791
00:30:58,274 --> 00:30:59,356
You have to do it.

792
00:30:59,356 --> 00:31:01,657
So you can lie to an
many people as you want

793
00:31:01,657 --> 00:31:03,915
about your level of happiness
and what works for you,

794
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:06,491
but you must not lie to yourself.

795
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:07,842
- Alright, well Megyn, thank
you so much for the time.

796
00:31:07,842 --> 00:31:08,675
It's been fun.

797
00:31:08,675 --> 00:00:00,000
- My pleasure.
