1
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,760
You know I don't want to come.
I didn't want to come back,

2
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,730
but when I heard about
the conveyor belt of death

3
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,268
that the politicians were
trying to set in motion.

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:38,071
I guess I knew that I wouldn't
be able to live with myself

5
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,806
if I didn't come back and try
to do something.

6
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,007
You know, if I were to
just sit around

7
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:43,276
and let these
people be killed.

8
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:47,647
I would have to think about
that for the rest of my life.

9
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,282
Thank you, guys,
you know.

10
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,789
I felt the need to
come down here.

11
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,224
I don't know any of the
individuals personally,

12
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,794
but I know what they're going
through of course because I

13
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:05,131
spent time on H-Unit death row,
down in McAlester, Oklahoma.

14
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,400
and I was actually there for
12 and a half years,

15
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,835
16 and a half
overall.

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,141
And you also have a
personal plea from

17
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,977
an exonerated death row inmate
that was put on death row at

18
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:21,214
the age of 19 and spent 16
and a half years for a crime

19
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,784
I did not commit. I plead for
empathy for those seven souls.

20
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,386
OK. Thank you.

21
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:27,120
You're welcome.

22
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:27,921
And your name?

23
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,389
My name is
Paris L. Powell.

24
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:30,557
Hi, Paris.

25
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,568
I came to this state just for
this reason, to ask for empathy.

26
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,904
Is the governor considering
granting clemency?

27
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,041
The governor is continuing
to review the clemency

28
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,742
application, he hasn't
made any decisions yet.

29
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,511
Do you know when
he'll make a decision?

30
00:01:51,511 --> 00:00:00,000
I do not.
