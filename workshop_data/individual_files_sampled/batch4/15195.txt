get ready to be confused and wonder if you've walked into another country the Meg is the surprise box-office hit of the summer so far so how can a movie that openly depicts a masculine hero saving women and children that openly objectifies and sexualizes a person and even depicts them being spied on while they're naked taking away their dignity and their identity how can the media not criticize it let this happen because no guy cares if you fawn over their ripped abs and take a peek afterwards and guess what apparently neither does any other foreign box office guess what deranged leftist you're all alone I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood the mag was over ten years in the making it was made for a whopping 130 million dollars this movie was a huge risk to make and apparently this movie will pay off which is insane because it is so weird so awkward makes no sense to me whatsoever and it still could crush the box that was controlling it and you can see this from the fact that it opened up in very few foreign box offices China being one the number one that pulled in over fifty million dollars opening week and almost the entire movie takes place in China and has tons of Chinese lead characters but don't worry I'll explain the difference and it's hilarious alright so as a movie I'm gonna give this a 3 out of 5 honestly when I watch this movie I was pretty thrown I was looking forward to it because I was doing what the box office critics kind of liked it but this movie the reason I couldn't enjoy it because it didn't make any sense it didn't know what it was is it a horror movie uh definitely not is it an 80s action flick a little bit is it a slapstick comedy probably so let's just spend 130 million dollars and make it all three if you can manage to turn your brain off when you go to this movie you will definitely enjoy it it's still very entertaining however I could not get over the difference in an Asian market movie and a Hollywood movie for instance the lead actors are acting completely different they go over the top and then melodramatic it was literally like watching an anime people be really serious for a second Ellison there's an awkward pause a weird joke a monster ripping someone in half and then you have the lead Chinese love interest soo-eun fawning over the hunky Jason Statham like right afterwards oh here comes a giant prehistoric shark to kill us all it's just like all that's going on the same time is absolutely crazy what is this okay so as a critic I'm gonna give this movie a 2 out of 5 boilers ahead this movie was hilarious literally it was the most classic 80s action movie setup of all time they're like these people down there they need to be saved there's nothing we can do there is one person we can call no dear God man we can't possibly ask him to come back he's washed up he'll never come back but we have to try sure enough they find Jason Statham bring him back and they give him a physical before they dive down there to rescue these people at the very bottom of the ocean and they give him a physical like dear God he's in perfect physical condition and Jason his stands up kids and gets in this submarine starts descending it like a hundred miles an hour just impossible and then they're like what's he doing he's turning off all vitals he's burning all the jee-in to the thrusters to get there faster and he's like going darkman like it's like so classic and funny and awesome and just so you know the part that I was referencing in my opening monologue Jason Statham has this scene where he has his shirt off in the lead girl so you and walks in there's like whoa you're naked so you and just checks him out kind of giggles walks off and then she's like spying through the window on him while he's naked changing clothes like this would never fly in any other movie right now Jason Statham by the way is an action stud the dudes 50 completely shredded and in amazing shape and commands the scenes every single time he's on camera he's by far the best person in the movie but what also kind of makes this movie work is that it doesn't take itself too seriously the movie knows they're completely pandering to the Chinese market they even have some wink and nod they're talking about Shark Week to give a nice cultural reference to the American market it's like there's hey we know guys this doesn't make any sense just just it's okay it's fun just enjoy it question is why this movie do well well these foreign markets really do like monster movies and the lead characters themselves stay in their lanes we want our heroes to act like action heroes yes it's unbelievable yes it's stupid yes is on the nose but it's fun to actually watch our heroes be heroic and take down sharks I know that's shocking to a lot of liberal critics now my faith in values is actually a four out of five I know what are you getting out of four to five because just like regular Americans the foreign box-office like their heroes to behave and act and be depicted like heroes Jason Statham's character Jonah see what they did there Jonah the big fish yeah is a manly rugged sacrificial guy that struggle with making a very difficult choice and was reeling from the consequences but he steps up when the time comes to save the people he loves he is sacrificing the entire movie he's a man's man and he's the kind of guy people want to look up to and have them be their action hero anyway on all the Meg was definitely not my kind of movie apparently a lot of people like it and these are the reasons why I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood did you enjoy that video of course you enjoyed that video so now you need to become a premium member to the rebel that way you have first access to pure Hollywood and
