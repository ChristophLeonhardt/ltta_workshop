00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,059
i'm joined with Jim lanzone he's the

2
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,060
founder and<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEO of clicker which is a</font>

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,520
web video site to help you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font>

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,859
good online to watch is that a fair

5
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,539
description yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I think we call</font>

6
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,910
ourselves the first complete programming

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,980
guide for for internet television so

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not just all the video that's out</font>

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,130
there I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you can search on youtube</font>

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a clip you want but when you want to</font>

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,809
find true episodic programming the

12
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:40,980
things that you would normally watch on

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">your television but that are now</font>

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,219
migrating online we're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only way to</font>

15
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,230
really effectively find what's available

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to watch and where to watch it so what's</font>

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,280
on click or is that music videos is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,890
full episodes of movies<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually all</font>

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,770
three of those it is 450,000 full

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,289
episodes and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything from real</font>

21
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,239
television shows that are on line two

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,260
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would deem to be</font>

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,780
broadcast<font color="#CCCCCC"> quality they're native to the</font>

24
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet you know a cooking video from</font>

25
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">the New York Times for example that you</font>

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,180
would watch in your television if it was

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,700
available so 450,000 episodes of that

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,640
across 1,200 categories and then also

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,630
50,000 movies and sorry 30,000 movies in

30
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,020
50,000 music videos so one of the kind

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,090
of descriptions I that I've seen around

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web is sort of a TV Guide for for</font>

33
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,530
web video TV Guide<font color="#E5E5E5"> was something people</font>

34
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,659
would read in the bathroom whereas web

35
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,310
video is something there you know kind

36
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">of doing more actively how do you make</font>

37
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that people come to your site</font>

38
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,040
before they go to youtube or find a

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,869
video<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a blog or something like that I</font>

40
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,520
30 to say how<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we're</font>

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">washed in the bathroom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh that was the</font>

42
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,590
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> question well I mean I just think</font>

43
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,659
things are changing when TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> Guide just</font>

44
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,909
started it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1953 there were three</font>

45
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,280
networks and there were 48 modules on

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,740
the schedule grid and what we do is if

47
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,110
think if you're creating TV got in 2009

48
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,210
what would that look like the next 50

49
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,399
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to be not a scheduled</font>

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,320
programming but a world of infinite

51
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,360
video on demand which is great it's a

52
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,310
great opportunity but it's a huge

53
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,199
problem to find anything

54
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,080
order so in the future you'll be

55
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,170
watching things whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's on your</font>

56
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">iphone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blackberry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or on your laptop</font>

57
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,519
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your plasma off of one corpus one</font>

58
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:22,950
grid of programming and and so that's

59
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we bring some order</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to so there's</font>

60
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,599
kind of a movement<font color="#E5E5E5"> toward hardware and</font>

61
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,069
software products that are that are

62
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:30,660
designed to make web video a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

63
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,030
like TV like there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> roku box and</font>

64
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,760
software from boxy and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple TV and</font>

65
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,470
things like that do you have to be

66
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,750
installed on those devices as well in

67
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,370
order to kind of be in every situation

68
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,530
where someone will be watching web video

69
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,360
or are you just trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick to the</font>

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,980
computer and maybe the cell phone know

71
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,040
both so we were already in talks with a

72
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,959
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those people and last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> night for</font>

73
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,480
example we just demoed our appt at the

74
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">boxy beta launch here in New York and</font>

75
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,590
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to people at grow to about</font>

76
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,299
integration of clicker I mean our goal

77
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:02,579
is is that when you see our logo in our

78
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:04,019
name you know that's the way to navigate

79
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,760
programming in this next<font color="#E5E5E5"> generation</font>

80
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,530
whether that's on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your cat</font>

81
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">your laptop or on your regular</font>

82
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,670
television<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes what we the thing is it's</font>

83
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,130
a database of programs and so it can

84
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,989
it's really agile it can go anywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

85
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:17,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can reflect the landscape of what's</font>

86
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,170
available on any device in any situation

87
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,410
and you used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work at ask.com how does</font>

88
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,180
video search kind of work into clicker

89
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,519
and it you know is that some place where

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,440
you have to have better technology than

91
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google or is the search kind of in the</font>

92
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">back end and not something that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> user</font>

93
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,109
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on um well there's two</font>

94
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:38,609
different ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> really effectively</font>

95
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:41,010
find this stuff one is searching and we

96
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,569
do obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think a very good job of</font>

97
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're search guys but also browsing</font>

98
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,950
so we were broken down into<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,200</font>

99
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,049
categories and subcategories you can go

100
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:50,250
into comedy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you can navigate</font>

101
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,590
down to stand up sketch or even things

102
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,540
like African American comedy if you want

103
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,160
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very narrow and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do</font>

104
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that all browsing without actually</font>

105
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,859
having to use your keyboard you could

106
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:00,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">just use a remote for something like</font>

107
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so we do it both ways but it's very</font>

108
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,700
technology driven so we identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

109
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,709
sources that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want in our system and</font>

110
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:09,510
then everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from their own is all</font>

111
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology-based it's all automated to</font>

112
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:13,829
maintain an understanding of what's

113
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:16,079
available what's changing for example

114
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now it's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unpredictable and</font>

115
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,478
seinfeld is a great example it's not an

116
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:22,889
NBC it's actually hosted on

117
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:25,830
TBS and they have six to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten episodes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

118
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,509
a time they come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and down off the web</font>

119
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,210
and very random fashion and so clicker

120
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,740
stays on top of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all automated</font>

121
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,870
without people having to kind of do that

122
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,969
and we do that across thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shows</font>

123
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:37,680
across thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different websites</font>

124
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,210
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way it's fragmented</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right now</font>

125
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,219
that's one way for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not have</font>

126
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:43,469
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about what you know of these 50</font>

127
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:45,120
websites I need to go to to find where

128
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,919
signs old is playing your kind of

129
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,240
pulling it all into<font color="#CCCCCC"> one place we're</font>

130
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,620
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousands of places where</font>

131
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,029
programming is scattered and then you

132
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,949
have the situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> where some things are</font>

133
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:55,830
free and some things are paid and we've

134
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,539
now integrated netflix and amazon VOD

135
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adding itunes and others in the</font>

136
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:01,439
future<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know you might want to</font>

137
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,879
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's not available</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the web</font>

138
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> available if it were if you were</font>

139
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,129
to join<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflix or something and and so</font>

140
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:10,379
we you know we view our job is telling

141
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:13,229
you what's available online and whether

142
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,849
that's free or paid that's online<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

143
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:16,319
you make the decision of where you want

144
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,939
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> or how you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know access</font>

145
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:20,460
it great thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> joining me Jim that</font>

146
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">was Jim lands owned from clicker check</font>

147
00:05:22,080 --> 00:00:00,000
it out
