1
00:00:11,215 --> 00:00:17,254
>> Bret:

2
00:00:17,255 --> 00:00:18,622
>> I'M SAYING THIS PRESIDENT HAS

3
00:00:18,623 --> 00:00:19,890
DONE A HORRIBLE THING.

4
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:21,591
AND NOT STANDING UP AND SPEAKING

5
00:00:21,592 --> 00:00:23,860
THE TRUTH ARE SUPPORTING THE

6
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:25,662
PRESIDENT IN A WAY THAT

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,204
THEM, WHAT HAVE YOU.

8
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:36,573
SO WHEN I SAID I STAND BY MY

9
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:39,876
STAND UP.

10
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:41,478
MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD AND

11
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,312
EXPLAINED WHY YOU THINK THEY ARE

12
00:00:42,313 --> 00:00:44,681
WRONG AND YOU ARE RIGHT.

13
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:50,620
SHOULD CALL FOR THE HARASSMENT

14
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:51,321
OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS.

15
00:00:51,322 --> 00:00:53,724
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

16
00:00:57,662 --> 00:00:58,562
DEMOCRATS THOUGHT THAT MAXINE

17
00:00:58,563 --> 00:01:00,430
WATERS DID OVER THE WEEKEND,

18
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:01,965
REACTING TO THE STORY ABOUT

19
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:04,668
SARAH SANDERS BEING THROWN OUT

20
00:01:04,669 --> 00:01:06,203
OF THE RESTAURANT IN VIRGINIA.

21
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:12,109
YOU NEED TO TELL THEM THEY ARE

22
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,878
NOT WELCOME ANYWHERE, ANYMORE.

23
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,881
THE PRESIDENT TWEETING OUT ABOUT

24
00:01:27,392 --> 00:01:30,460
EXTRAORDINARILY LOW IQ PERSON,

25
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:31,661
AS COME TOGETHER WITH

26
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:32,462
NANCY PELOSI.

27
00:01:32,463 --> 00:01:36,299
SHE HAS JUST CALLED FOR HARM FOR

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,167
SUPPORTERS, OF WHICH THERE ARE

29
00:01:37,168 --> 00:01:39,102
MANY INDIAN MAKE AMERICA GREAT

30
00:01:39,103 --> 00:01:39,569
AGAIN MOVEMENT.

31
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,506
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR,

32
00:01:42,507 --> 00:01:44,441
MAX."

33
00:01:44,442 --> 00:01:49,880
WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT ALL THIS?

34
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:51,248
CHARLES HERBERT, OPINION EDITOR

35
00:01:51,249 --> 00:01:54,451
FOR "THE WASHINGTON TIMES" ."

36
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:54,785
CHARLIE?

37
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:56,486
>> YOU KNOW YOU HAVE PROBABLY

38
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:57,854
GONE TOO FAR WHEN YOU HAVE

39
00:01:57,855 --> 00:02:01,691
CHUCK SCHUMER AND NANCY PELOSI

40
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:04,261
PULLING HER CHAIN BACK A LITTLE

41
00:02:04,262 --> 00:02:05,462
BIT.

42
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:06,663
YOU KNOW, IT'S TOUGH.

43
00:02:06,664 --> 00:02:08,231
I KNOW THAT THIS IS THE KIND OF

44
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:11,902
THING THAT REALLY EXCITES A LOT

45
00:02:11,903 --> 00:02:15,305
OF A SORT OF THE MOST RABID

46
00:02:15,306 --> 00:02:18,475
SUPPORTERS ON THE LEFT, NOT

47
00:02:20,478 --> 00:02:22,379
LEFT, THE MOST VOCIFEROUS HATERS

48
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:22,879
OF DONALD TRUMP.

49
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,815
BUT IT'S NOT HELPING THEM WIN

50
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:26,883
ANY NEW VOTERS IN THE MIDDLE.

51
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:31,922
WITH THE VAST COMPLEXITIES ON

52
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:33,256
THE BORDER, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

53
00:02:33,257 --> 00:02:35,625
SOME WAY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM

54
00:02:39,263 --> 00:02:40,464
IF THE OTHER CHOICES MAXINE

55
00:02:40,465 --> 00:02:42,265
WATERS GOING OUT AND SAYING,

56
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:44,835
PESTER THESE PEOPLE IN PUBLIC.

57
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:47,704
I THINK MOST VOTERS ARE GOING TO

58
00:02:47,705 --> 00:02:50,874
SORT OF GO OR BE FORCED TOWARDS

59
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:51,508
THE TRUNK VERSION.

60
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:52,876
>> Bret: IF THIS DOES HAPPEN A

61
00:02:52,877 --> 00:02:54,678
LOT IT SEEMS WHEN DEMOCRATS ARE

62
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:55,679
LOOKING AT A POLITICAL UPSIDE,

63
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,881
FOR A STORY THAT IS MEATY

64
00:02:57,882 --> 00:02:58,882
CRATERING ON THE REPUBLICAN

65
00:03:04,255 --> 00:03:06,590
HEIDI HEITKAMP AND JOE DONNELLY,

66
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:15,365
PARTY TO BE THE LEFT WING MIRROR

67
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:17,300
IMAGE OF THE THINGS THEY DON'T

68
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:22,472
LIKE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.

69
00:03:22,473 --> 00:03:24,107
AND THAT IS THE CHALLENGE.

70
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:26,176
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S WRONG BECAUSE

71
00:03:26,177 --> 00:03:28,144
THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT WHEN

72
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:29,479
DONALD TRUMP DID IT.

73
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,847
SECOND OF ALL IT'S TACTICALLY

74
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:31,615
STUPID BECAUSE IT WILL BACKFIRE

75
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:36,186
HIS SUPPORTERS ARE THE VICTIMS

76
00:03:36,187 --> 00:03:37,687
OF THE LEFT WING MOB.

77
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:39,990
SO IT'S NOT GOING TO LEAD TO

78
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:41,525
ANYTHING GOOD FOR DEMOCRATS AND

79
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:43,860
THAT'S WHY YOU SAW HER CALLED

80
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:45,328
OUT AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE

81
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:51,968
THE MERITS.

82
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:53,136
>> IT'S ENCOURAGING THAT SOME

83
00:03:53,137 --> 00:03:55,272
PEOPLE HAVE CHALLENGED WHAT THEY

84
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:57,307
HAVE SAID, AND DAVID AXELROD

85
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:02,546
NUMBER OF FOLKS ON THE LEFT TO

86
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:03,480
APPLAUD THE EXPULSION OF SARAH

87
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:04,114
HUCKABEE SANDERS FROM THE

88
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:06,483
RESTAURANT AND THEN WENT ON TO

89
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:15,458
THERE IS NO LONG-TERM UPSIDE IN

90
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:16,726
THIS KIND OF INCIVILITY.

91
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:17,893
POLITICS IS THE ART OF

92
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:19,929
PERSUASION AND OF THE PEOPLE WHO

93
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,930
MAKE LONG-TERM GAINS IN POLITICS

94
00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:22,599
ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DO A BETTER

95
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,934
JOB OF PERSUADING OTHERS THAT

96
00:04:27,672 --> 00:04:29,472
TAKE POLITICAL MOMENTS AND MAKE

97
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:30,674
THEM POLITICAL MOVEMENTS.

98
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:33,276
THESE ARE NOT ABOUT ARGUMENTS,

99
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:35,412
WERE NOT PERSUADING ANYBODY.

100
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:37,681
IF DEMOCRATS FOLLOW MAXINE

101
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:38,882
WATERS' ADVICE AND GET IN THE

102
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:40,317
FACE OF DEMOCRATS AND HARASS

103
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:45,488
THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS?

104
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:47,490
AND IT GOES THE OTHER WAY TOO.

105
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:49,693
DONALD TRUMP MADE ONE OF THOSE

106
00:04:49,694 --> 00:04:51,294
COMMENTS, DID HE ACTUALLY THINK

107
00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:52,896
HE MIGHT CONVERT A DEMOCRAT THAT

108
00:04:52,897 --> 00:04:55,131
COULD BE PERSUADED BY AN

109
00:04:55,132 --> 00:04:56,566
ARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF HIS

110
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:56,900
POLICY?

111
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:01,404
SHORT TERM.

112
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:02,672
>> Bret: IT RIGHT.

113
00:05:05,676 --> 00:05:07,877
I SAID I WAS GOING TO COME AS OF

114
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:12,282
LATE FRIEND OF

115
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:12,882
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.

116
00:05:12,883 --> 00:05:15,285
HERE'S WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT WHAT

117
00:05:15,286 --> 00:05:15,919
IT MEANS POLITICALLY.

118
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,621
>> THEY DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE,

119
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:18,955
THIS IS THE SAME REGION THAT

120
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:20,123
HILLARY WAS.

121
00:05:20,124 --> 00:05:20,957
THEY ARE NOW FIXATED ON TRUMP

122
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:24,127
AND IT'S ALL ON THE RESISTANCE,

123
00:05:24,128 --> 00:05:24,628
ALL ABOUT TRUMP.

124
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:26,162
BUT THINK OF THE BIG PICTURE,

125
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:28,565
WHY DO THEY WANT TO WIN THE

126
00:05:28,566 --> 00:05:29,532
HOUSE?

127
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:29,933
ONE REASON.

128
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:32,535
NOT TAX REFORM, NOT JOBS.

129
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:33,970
THEY WANT TO WIN SO THEY CAN

130
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:35,171
START ON IMPEACHING THE

131
00:05:35,172 --> 00:05:37,407
PRESIDENT AND UNDOING THE

132
00:05:37,408 --> 00:05:38,742
ELECTION OF 2016.

133
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:39,943
THAT'S OF THE BIGGEST POLITICAL

134
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:40,710
MISTAKE AND POLITICAL STRATEGY I

135
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:42,812
HAVE EVER SEEN AND I THINK

136
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:45,515
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT A

137
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:47,450
WORTHY CAUSE.

138
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:48,885
>> Bret: ONE YEAR AGO THIS

139
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:49,853
WEEK.

140
00:05:54,558 --> 00:05:55,558
THROUGH LONG COMPLICATED LEGAL

141
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:58,695
PROCESSES IS NOT THE WAY TO GO.

142
00:05:58,696 --> 00:06:01,231
WE WILL ALWAYS BE DYSFUNCTIONAL

143
00:06:01,232 --> 00:06:02,966
PEOPLE, AND THEY MUST BE STOPPED

144
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:04,601
AT THE BORDER AND NOT BE BROUGHT

145
00:06:04,602 --> 00:06:05,268
ANY LEGALLY.

146
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,903
IF THIS IS DONE, ILLEGAL

147
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:07,637
IMMIGRATION WILL BE STOPPED IN

148
00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:10,674
ITS TRACKS AND, THIS IS THE ONLY

149
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:13,677
REAL ANSWER AND WE MUST CONTINUE

150
00:06:13,678 --> 00:06:14,711
TO BUILD THE WALL.

151
00:06:14,712 --> 00:06:16,646
>> IS SO LAST WEEK DONALD TRUMP

152
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:18,682
HAD EVERYTHING THROWN AT HIM BY

153
00:06:18,683 --> 00:06:19,883
EVERYBODY BASED ON THESE IMAGES

154
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:21,418
DOWN ON THE BORDER, SOME OF

155
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:27,223
AND OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR OF

156
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:29,859
COURSE BEING THE PHOTOSHOP COVER

157
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,494
OF "TIME" MAGAZINE, WHERE IT HAS

158
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:32,896
DONALD TRUMP LOOKING AT THIS

159
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:33,763
GIRL WHO IS CRYING AT IT TURNS

160
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:35,665
OUT THAT CHILD WAS NEVER

161
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,133
SEPARATED FROM HER PARENTS AND

162
00:06:37,134 --> 00:06:39,102
IN FACT, FOR THE REPORTING'S

163
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,570
SHOWS OF THE MOTHER HAD LEFT HER

164
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:42,806
OTHER CHILDREN BACK HOME WHICH

165
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:45,975
SUGGESTS THAT MAYBE IT'S A SIGN

166
00:06:45,976 --> 00:06:47,711
SHE IS NOT GOING TO SUCCEED IN

167
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:48,678
GETTING ASYLUM AND DOESN'T

168
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:50,714
DESERVE ASYLUM BASED ON THE

169
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:51,715
CRITERIA.

170
00:06:51,716 --> 00:06:53,483
BUT NOW AFTER A WEEK OF THE

171
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:55,485
HYSTERIA HAS SORT OF PAST AND,

172
00:06:55,486 --> 00:06:58,388
WE ARE STILL DOWN TO A REALLY

173
00:06:58,389 --> 00:06:59,689
COMPLICATED SITUATION ON THE

174
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,391
BORDER, I THINK THAT MOVED BY

175
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:05,495
DONALD TRUMP TO TALK ABOUT

176
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:06,863
KEEPING PEOPLE FROM GETTING INTO

177
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:09,466
THE COUNTRY SO WE DON'T HAVE TO

178
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:12,102
GIVE THEM DUE PROCESS, IT'S AN

179
00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:14,904
ARGUMENT FOR BUILDING A WALL.

180
00:07:14,905 --> 00:07:16,539
OR ANYTHING, SOMETHING THAT

181
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,608
PREVENTS THEM FROM GETTING

182
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:19,776
ACROSS THE BORDER BORDER.

183
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:21,511
>> I AGREE LAST WEEK WAS A BAD

184
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:25,915
PRETTY MUDDLED.

185
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,517
WE ARE STRONG ON BORDERS, THE

186
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:29,486
DEMOCRATS ARE WEAK ON BORDERS,

187
00:07:29,487 --> 00:07:30,720
THAT SAFER GROUND FOR HIM.

188
00:07:34,692 --> 00:07:36,459
A DON McGAHN ASYLUM PROCESS IS

189
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,328
TO SEE WHETHER THEY DESERVE TO

190
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:40,196
BE LET INTO THE COUNTRY OR NOT.

191
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:43,833
TO DECIDE BY FEE AT THAT THEY

192
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:45,502
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO, OR SEND

193
00:07:45,503 --> 00:07:48,571
THEM OVER THE BORDER TO MEXICO,

194
00:07:48,572 --> 00:07:50,273
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A

195
00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:55,912
UNDERCOVER.

196
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:57,280
THE FORMER HOMELAND SECURITY

197
00:07:57,281 --> 00:07:59,115
CHIEF JAY JOHNSON TALKING ABOUT

198
00:07:59,116 --> 00:08:01,484
NOT ONLY CHILD SEPARATION BUT

199
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:02,786
STOPPING PEOPLE AT THE BORDER.

200
00:08:02,787 --> 00:08:04,587
>> WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE IMAGES

201
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:07,390
AND THE REALITY FROM 2014 JUST

202
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:13,296
DETENTION.

203
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:15,732
WE HAD THEN 34,000 BEDS FOR

204
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:18,501
FAMILY DETENTION AND ONLY 95 OF

205
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:20,270
34,000 EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH

206
00:08:24,475 --> 00:08:26,476
WE BELIEVED IT WAS NECESSARY AT

207
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:35,251
FAMILIES.

208
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:38,387
WE CAN'T HAVE CATCH AND RELEASE.

209
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:40,990
>> WHILE THERE WERE NO PEOPLE

210
00:08:40,991 --> 00:08:41,891
BEING KICKED OUT OF RESTAURANTS.

211
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:46,763
LOTS OF THINGS WERE MISSING BUT

212
00:08:46,764 --> 00:08:49,465
ONE THING THAT WAS MISSING WAS

213
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,535
WHAT WE WERE SEEING WASN'T ON

214
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:53,503
PRECEDENT.

215
00:08:53,504 --> 00:08:56,372
THE REASON IT WAS HAPPENING IN

216
00:08:56,373 --> 00:08:56,940
INCREASING NUMBERS WAS

217
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:57,373
UNPRECEDENTED.

218
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,709
IT WAS A RESULT OF IT POLICY

219
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,643
DECISION THAT THE TRUMP

220
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:01,511
ADMINISTRATION HAD MADE BECAUSE

221
00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:04,547
I WANTED THIS TO SERVE AS A

222
00:09:04,548 --> 00:09:04,914
DETERRENT.

223
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:05,682
THE ALL OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAD

224
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:06,850
A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO IT AND

225
00:09:06,851 --> 00:09:08,651
THEY ARGUED THAT WHAT THEY DID,

226
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:11,521
THEY HAD TO DO, AND IT WAS

227
00:09:11,522 --> 00:09:11,921
REGRETTABLE.

228
00:09:11,922 --> 00:09:12,689
BUT IT HAPPENED.

229
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,123
WE DIDN'T HEAR IT HAPPEN UNTIL

230
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:15,458
SEVERAL DAYS INTO THE DEBATE

231
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:17,560
WHICH WAS A FAILURE ON

232
00:09:17,561 --> 00:09:18,161
MAINSTREAM MEDIA.

233
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:20,563
CHARLIE IS RIGHT, THERE IS ALL

234
00:09:20,564 --> 00:09:21,598
THIS NAVEL-GAZING AMONG

235
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:22,432
JOURNALISTS THESE DAYS ABOUT

236
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:24,767
WHAT THEY CAN DO TO RESTORE

237
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:25,168
CREDIBILITY.

238
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:27,170
WHILE THE FIRST THING IS GET THE

239
00:09:27,171 --> 00:09:27,804
STORY RIGHT.

240
00:09:31,642 --> 00:00:00,000
BY A MISLEADING IMAGE.
