00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
before I say what I want to say I'm

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,799
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little story and it</font>

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,160
is of when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was at secondary school or</font>

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,880
high school here in America I was 17

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,820
turning 18 and I was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> frustrated</font>

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the way it was run there was a lot</font>

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,080
of bullying going on which wasn't dealt

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,060
with there was drug dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that wasn't</font>

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,460
dealt with there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of corruption</font>

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,740
and what I learned was that as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,140
your parents contributed a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font>

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,359
to the school but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would be okay no</font>

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,690
matter what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did and I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very angry</font>

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,820
with the way I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> treated by the</font>

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,399
teachers and I decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take action</font>

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,410
every year we had a public<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking</font>

17
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,510
competition where you would speak for

18
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,530
five minutes you could do an

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,690
after-dinner speech which is comedic he

20
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,300
could do a persuasive speech which is

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,770
what I chose to do or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do</font>

22
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,270
debates and my talk went on for nine

23
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,910
minutes and i wrote a massive speech

24
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,309
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> injustice within the school</font>

25
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,289
and when i write this speech i did the

26
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,449
respectful thing I went to teachers I

27
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,220
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the head of my year the head of</font>

28
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,470
sixth<font color="#E5E5E5"> form and I said this is what i</font>

29
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,080
plan to say to which they said I'm

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,210
really sorry you feel this way it

31
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,189
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be good to end the year on bad</font>

32
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,380
terms though and i highly recommend you

33
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't do it I stuck to my principal I</font>

34
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,490
turned up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I did the speech it was</font>

35
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first public speaking competition</font>

36
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,180
ever where the headmaster didn't turn up

37
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,200
I got a lot of support people that used

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,720
to disrespect me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and although the school</font>

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,490
wanted to take action against me the

40
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,900
reason they couldn't do anything was

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,909
because a lot of the teachers especially

42
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,439
in the staff room after I made the

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,299
speech agreed with what I had to say I

44
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,799
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on anymore but i will put the</font>

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">speech I learn off by heart and as it</font>

46
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,020
was written at the time in a journal and

47
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,939
paste it in description so go check<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

48
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,590
out if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want but where's this going</font>

49
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,840
well the ephah today get a really tough

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,369
time in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media I'm sure you will</font>

51
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,869
agree I get really sick<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hearing the</font>

52
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,360
constant negativity but at the same time

53
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,829
I do acknowledge there's a lot of

54
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:04,140
problems out there there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

55
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,960
teenagers that do cause problems and

56
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,360
feed the media with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to give</font>

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,670
us all a bad reputation I don't know how

58
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,730
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is worldwide but in</font>

59
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,319
England it definitely is a big problem

60
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,390
and recently I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> across a charity</font>

61
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,239
which is hoping to<font color="#E5E5E5"> improve the situation</font>

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,519
with the you for today so with the story

63
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,379
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I told there's a big point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

64
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:28,159
and it is as use we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> want respect we</font>

65
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,799
can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect to get it we need to</font>

66
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:32,420
show we can contribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> some constructive</font>

67
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to society and we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show you that</font>

68
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,010
we are all as the media depicts us so

69
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,390
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to leave the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> video there but</font>

70
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,390
all I will say is over the next several

71
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,310
weeks there is a great cause going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

72
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,290

76
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,660
youtubers who will be doing talks on

77
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,609
other issues as well and all I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want</font>

78
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,560
to say is if you've never blogged before

79
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,540
if you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've never had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

80
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,569
