00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,509
cut I can't imagine what it must be like

37
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,470
to have 17 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work and things that</font>

38
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,799
you choose to reveal to fans things like

39
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,810
illustrations and maps and things that

40
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,970
aren't explicitly stated in the books

41
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,549

the books have all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> published</font>

43

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,240
fantastic website and the net for

46
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,560
someone to do that especially after all

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,690
cease and desist letters and

48
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,130
allegedly anyway I just I don't

49
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,920

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,400
how you can do that really and then to

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,010
go and to Warner Brothers as well for

62
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,480
herself to be a very grounded person so

63
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,670
the fact that there's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're suing</font>
