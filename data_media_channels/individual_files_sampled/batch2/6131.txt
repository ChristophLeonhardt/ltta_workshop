after Trump was elected the how we discussed people that voted for Trump and this them versus us it became evident to me that that kind of stuff we got to cut it out you know I mean I have five brothers a couple of them voted for Trump I'm not gonna not say that what I'm in Texas of course I got people that voted for Trump they're awesome individuals they just wanted to throw the table up they wanted to throw the table up and you know what sometimes I want to throw the table up to about the Democrats I was throwing it to throw the table up when we didn't put anybody in jail after Wall Street I wanted to throw the table up when we didn't get a public option I wanted to throw the table up when we didn't get any lots of stuff done in the Barack Obama administration that I took off a year of my life to help the let because we wanted to get along with people that was our opportunity and so I think we need to have this reckoning all right welcome we're here to talk about as we often are that the Democratic Party who better to join us than a Democrat Lilian Salerno running for Congress in Dallas is it suburban Dallas in part part of Dallas or lots of Dallas and then a lot of the suburbs so gerrymandered district called the Texas 32 is this being an expensive process here she is in Washington where a lot of political money circulates people come here they try to grab a little bit of it and take it back to their district spend it on winning now lilian in order to get where she has now had to win a runoff earlier if people remember that the famous one was the Laura Moser primary but they were turned out other primaries in Texas that same day and she advanced along with Colin Allred the runoff election will be on the 22nd of May right so you're in the homestretch I'm Colin Allred I'm running for Congress in Texas is thirty second congressional district I'm Lillian Salerno and I'm the Democratic candidate for the 32nd district and a runoff on May 22nd it's not that it's going to be a cakewalk to beat Pete sessions he's a formidable opponent we're never going to really out spin Pete sessions I think what we can do is have a lot more excitement I'm running against the young lawyer we had our first debate real debate last night and I just did a con of my experience in his and basically I've been standing up to power for most of my life coming to Washington DC advocating for small businesses and nurses and I just want to come up here and fight for people and that makes it so maybe I'm not the favorite child of the old-school Democratic Party but I'm an old-school Texas Democrat and that's why I'm running your opponent has the the d-triple-c endorsement did he get that after the first round of the primary yes it was after the primary now normally when we when we do these there's something fairly obvious about a person's background you say oh well that's why that person got the d-trip background they're their corporate lawyer or their whatever whatever they are I Collins Collins a different kind of cannon he was he was a linebacker in the NFL went on to work for the Obama administration it kind of in a civil rights lawyer nothing that nothing that jumps out and screams kind of establishment why do you think that the d-triple-c ended up going with him rather than you given that both of you have you know viable paths both to winning the primary and also to winning the general well I think there's a lot of folk powers-that-be at play one is I mean we both raising the same kind of money we had another candidate in our race who was a good candidate and there was seven of us and it just was strange that they came in because of course they were talking to me and the other candidate and Colin he got more votes for sure so that that's their reason but I believe that votes matter but I also believe this is a this a runoff election I'm confident we're gonna win because we need to win because we need to win back the house and I believe I have a clear path to victory and I believe that the Democratic Party sometimes doesn't want somebody that they can't control and they can't control me is this your first time running yes all of us in this primary were first-time candidates so you you have the endorsement of Emily's list what was what was that like to get and what's it been like to work with him is because III asked for a reason I've heard from some other candidates who have been excited when they get the endorsement of not just emily's list this this applies to progress of lefty groups to centrist groups to everybody one thing at the these endorsements sometimes they have to then have their consultants on all their conference calls and they're sharing all of their their budgeting and their their campaign information and they say glad I got that endorsement but can you kind of just leave me alone for a minute so what what what has the what's been the most surprising thing about that endorsement or other ones that you've gotten well it's always one of those things where for me I'm a I'm a business person I look at everything sort of as an entrepreneur and as an entrepreneur you'd never go out and say hey I don't know what I'm doing but I have to raise a million dollars now let me figure out what I'm doing it should always go hey I'm gonna get these votes by doing a B and C now let me go tell the public why I need five hundred thousand dollars the consultancy class seems to have something as goofy way goofy because they just come up with these amounts and then you have to feed into it so the process is a little bit backwards in my mind so for me just as a just as an individual it's been a little crazy that the way they do their spreadsheets and everything is completely opposite people would run a normal business it's all about the money it's a lot about the money it's a lot about the money and so in other words they'll say you need two hundred fifty thousand dollars this quarter yeah or you know nobody really knows but we think we're gonna need thirty mailers and we're gonna need digital this I don't know if you need thirty mailers maybe you just need a good candidate maybe you just need a good message maybe you just need people to figure out what you're gonna do different is it all about that you have to hire XY and Z person to win this election because it couldn't be and this is what the money I mean I'm sure my opponent I think he's in New York today raising money I flew in I fly back tomorrow because I don't like to be out of district nobody does as close to an election but you have to come get all your family and friends to give you all their money I worked for the Obama administration for five years I'm asking all people that are concerned about things like corporate concentration and food and nutrition from USDA and care about poor people means a lot of those people work in nonprofits they don't have the $2,700 checks so I to have a little bit more fundraisers than your standard Democrat tell us about your store how did you get into anti-monopoly work how'd you get into corporate concentration so that is that the thing I think for our viewers that really does differentiate you around the country they're a handful of and at the intercept we actually wrote about your race months and months ago is one one of a handful that we're actually making monopoly issues central to their campaign and how people respond to that yeah it's been hard this is another thing you know when you do polling you know it's not like people wake up and figure out why their wages haven't increased in the last 10 years in a place like Texas I mean we still have our minimum wage is $7.25 right I mean it ain't going anywhere and it was you know the average person in my district or in the North Texas area where I'm running makes I mean it's like 55 or $60,000 a year we don't have any wage increase but they don't instantly apply that that's because there's only two companies in telecom or there's only four companies and the people that just distribute eyeglasses or medical supplies and so me I had it very personal I started a small company with my partners back in the middle of the AIDS epidemic where we came up with a new way to protect nurses to make it so nurses felt safer of treating HIV patients and we went to the marketplace we were category right so syringes so that when you got a needle stick you wouldn't contract HIV or hepatitis it was something nurses wanted it was a public health need the National Institutes of Health gave us our first grant and our first monies and then when we went up we just got stopped by the big monopolist and we had to sue him and they settle with us and we sued him again but we never did get the kind of relief we should have gotten from the agencies in here in DC like the FTC in the antitrust department and that was then and that's 20 years ago and now it's even worse than it was then I assume you were in contact with the party with the d-triple-c throughout the primary were you surprised when they came in and endorsed your opponent or did you did you see that coming I didn't really see it coming I you know I mean I have you know all of us that have worked campaigns I worked on the Obama campaign ever a couple of other campaigns you know you know people and I just figured you know what I've given money to the Democratic Party I'm somebody who does what they asked me to over my career when I when I've been able to I didn't agree with them about Obamacare because I wanted a public option so I've certainly thrown down a few times and keep doing that I guess but right now I feel like our race is sort of a it's almost like a microcosm of really what's wrong with the party they ought to stay out of these races that'll let the people in the 32nd district decide and I don't think putting their thumb on it really helps and it also makes it so instead of talking about local issues like education and health care and a living wage we get all we talk about is DC and that makes it in these gerrymandered districts I can't win with that Republicans demand independence and I don't want to win without them because I don't want to just represent 50% of the population I think all of us out there running now realize we got to do better we can't come up here just with our democratic you know brand on we gotta fight for country right now and that makes it so when we're talking about all this stuff the Republicans and independents they're like oh here they go again so that's interesting so when the National Party from Washington comes in to these races and inserts itself I think it actually it backfires in a number of ways one of them you think is that it shifts the conversation that people started thinking Eric any questions what's the conversation like in your district on daca and Medicaid for all yeah doc is the first first in question always we got 124 thousand recipients in just my in Texas and so it's one of those things that's my opponent also we're both you know strident on this issue we should throw down we both you know for sure for me I have two Mexican kids you know that I adopted I would fight for daca recipients like I would my own kids it's something we need to take care of immediately and then for Medicaid for all place like Texas complete rejection any Medicaid expansion and so we just leave all this money on the table and we talked about that in our debate last night and you know we've got crazy politics in Texas and I don't think people realize when we have crazy politics because we have such a big congressional delegation second only to California with 38 people coming up here when we send crazy people up here we mess it up for all of us and so when I speak to my audience tonight in Washington DC or anywhere I always say you really need to care about what happens in Texas because when we're off especially with representatives because we only have three women out of a delegation of 38 we haven't elected a new woman to Congress for 22 years it throws the entire conversation off as seen through a woman's woman's lens you know
