KENTUCKY CURRENTLY HAS ONE
ABORTION CLINIC WHERE WOMEN CAN
HAVE THEIR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
AND CARRY OUT AN ABORTION SHOULD
THEY CHOOSE TO NOT THROUGH WITH
A PREGNANCY.
HOWEVER, LAWMAKERS IN KENTUCKY
ARE FIGHTING RATHER
AGGRESSIVELY TO SHUT THAT LAST
ABORTION CLINIC DOWN AND
THE WAY THAT THEY PLAN ON DOING
SO IS BY USING AND ENFORCING
A LAW THAT FORCES THEM TO HAVE
HOSPITAL ADMITTING PRIVILEGES.
THERE ARE MANY RED STATES THAT
HAVE TRIED TO IMPLEMENT A
SIMILAR POLICY.
COURTS HAVE ARTIE RULED ON THIS
POLICY.
NONETHELESS, THE RIGHT WING HE'S
FIGHTING ON WITH THIS.
THEY MAKE THE CLAIM THAT WELL,
THIS ABORTION CLINIC NEEDS TO
MAKE SURE THAT IF ANYTHING GOES
WRONG WITH THIS ABORTION
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEND
THIS INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY
ARE TREATING TO HOSPITAL.
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS IN MOST
RED STATES A LOT OF THESE
HOSPITALS REFUSED TO GIVE
ADMITTING PRIVILEGES TO THE
CLINICS BECAUSE THE HOSPITALS
THEMSELVES HAVE SOME RELIGIOUS
SLANTS AND FEEL LIKE IT IS
AGAINST THEIR MORALS TO DO SO
BUT IN THIS CASE, THE ABORTION
CLINIC DID HAVE HOSPITAL
ADMITTING PRIVILEGES, IT WAS
JUST CONSIDERED INSUFFICIENT BY
THE GOVERNOR 
OF KENTUCKY.
LET ME BEGIN TO BREAK THAT DOWN.
1ST OF ALL, I THOUGHT
REPUBLICANS WERE AGAINST
BURDENSOME REGULATIONS.
IT TURNS OUT THEY LOVE THEM WHEN
IT SUITS THEIR PURPOSES.
I THOUGHT THEY WERE FOR SMALL
GOVERNMENT.
IT TURNS OUT
THEY LOVE BIG GOVERNMENT WITH
ALL THE REGULATIONS GETTING
BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR.
YOU ARE NOT SURPRISED BY THAT.
2ND OF ALL, THAT IS A VERY
CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT IN
2016 SAYING LOOK, IT IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO INTERFERE
WITH A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO AN
ABORTION AND THE STATE OF TEXAS
CLEARLY AND POST AN UNDUE BURDEN
THAT INTERFERED WITH THE RIGHT
TO CHOOSE BASED ON NONSENSE OF
BURDENS BURDENSOME REGULATIONS A
SAID YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THIS
PROCEDURE AND THAT ONE WITH
NEARBY HOSPITALS AND YOU KNOW
WHY YOU ARE DOING THAT.
THE CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT
SAID YOU WERE NOT TRICKING
ANYONE.
WE KNOW YOU ARE TRYING TO LIMIT
ABORTIONS AND THESE ARE NOT
ACTUAL NECESSARY REGULATIONS.
YOU HAVE TO ENJOY THE IRONY
THAT EVEN AS CONSERVATIVE
SUPREME COURT SAYS IT IS
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE FOR
BURDENSOME UNNECESSARY
REGULATIONS.
NONETHELESS, KENTUCKY SAYS I DO
NOT CARE.
I'M GOING TO PASS THE SAME
EXACT LOT EVEN THOUGH IT GOT
DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL YEAR
AGO.
AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT, IT
TURNS OUT, NOTE.
THIS CLINIC WAS ACTUALLY
FOLLOWING THE RULES OF
KENTUCKY AND DID HAVE
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE
HOSPITALS EXACTLY LIKE THEY WERE
SUPPOSED TO AND THEY HAVE
HAD THEM FOR YEARS AND YEARS.
MAP EVAN COMES IN AND IS LIKE I
DON'T LIKE THE LAW.
I AM LIKE TRUMP.
HE DOESN'T LIKE THE LAW, SHERIFF
JOE DOESN'T LIKE THE LAW.
WHEN WE DON'T LIKE BLAH WE JUST
VIOLATED.
HE IS LIKE THE REGULATIONS THAT
WE PREVIOUSLY SAID WERE
SUFFICIENT, NO.
I'M JUST GOING TO SAY NOW THEY
ARE DEFICIENT.
I JUST DID AN EXECUTIVE ORDER
AND A SENSE AT THE STATE
LEVEL SAYING THAT I AM GOING TO
IMPOSE FURTHER REGULATIONS
ON YOU AND THERE IS NO WAY YOU
CAN REAP MEET THEM BECAUSE
IT IS MY JUDGMENT CALL.
THEY MAKE IT INCREASINGLY
DIFFICULT FOR THESE CLINICS
TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE
REGULATIONS AND AS SOON AS
THEY DO MEET THEM, THEY WILL
MAKE THEM EVEN MORE
STRINGENT, EVEN MORE IMPOSSIBLE
TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE
IN THIS CASE THEY DID MEET
THE REGULATIONS.
EVAN COMES IN AND GOES, THAT'S
YOUR OPINION.
I SAY YOU DIDN'T MEET THEM.
SO HOW CAN I MEET THEM?
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU
IT TELLS YOU HOW DISINGENUOUS
THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY DON'T
ACTUALLY THINK THAT THESE
PROCEDURES ARE SO DANGEROUS
THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE THESE
VERY SPECIFIC HOSPITALS
ADMITTING PRIVILEGES IN CASE OF
AN EMERGENCY.
NO, THEY JUST WANT TO MAKE IT AS
DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR THIS
ONE ABORTION CLINIC TO REMAIN
STANDING AND SO A FEDERAL JUDGE
HAD ARTIE RULED ON THIS AND SAID
OKAY, YOU WERE NOT ALLOWED TO
SHUT DOWN THIS CLINIC WHILE THIS
CASE IS PENDING AND SO A FEDERAL
COURT WILL MAKE A DECISION ON
THIS LEGISLATION SOON BUT
THE THING THAT I WANT TO BRING
UP IS IT'S A HUGE WASTE OF
TAXPAYER MONEY IN THE STATE OF
KENTUCKY BECAUSE AGAIN, THE
SUPREME COURT HAS ALREADY RULED
ON THIS AND SO OKAY, YOU
ARE GOING TO A FEDERAL COURT.
YOU ARE GOING TO SPEND TAXPAYER
MONEY TO FIGHT THIS AND IN
THE END, IT JUST DISPLAYS OUT
THE WAY THAT IT IS SUPPOSED
TO, IT WILL BE FOUND AS AN UNDUE
BURDEN AND THE CLINIC WILL
NOT SHUT DOWN.
AND STOP LYING.
WE KNOW YOU ARE PRO-LIFE AND YOU
ADMITTED.
JUST SAY, I WANT TO OVERTURN ROE
VERSUS WADE.
I KNOW THIS IS AN ILLEGAL LAW, I
KNOW IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
I WANTED TO ANYWAY BECAUSE
EVERYTHING WE ARE ONCE GO
TO THE SUPREME COURT AND TRY
AGAIN AND AGAIN.
BUT YOU ARE NOT BEING HONEST
ABOUT IT.
INSTEAD YOU ARE NOW SAYING
YOU ARE A CHAMPION OF
BURDENSOME REGULATIONS.
IT IS A LIE.
YOUR REPUBLICAN CONSTITUENTS
KNOW IT'S A LIE TOO.
GREAT, MATT BEVAN FOR FURTHER
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.
