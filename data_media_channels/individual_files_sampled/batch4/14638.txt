welcome to Declassified live Zoey's that weird little delay when I start this show isn't there there's only that strange little delay when I'm waiting to see if the stream goes live got a lot to talk about today we have two pretty big stories out there the first is Lisa Paige the FBI lawyer who was the attorney to some very senior people Andrew McCabe James Comey she then worked on Robert Mulder's team of course you know Lisa Paige being her boyfriend Peter stroke who were both having extramarital affairs well they exchanged about 50,000 anti-trump text messages pretty reprehensible stuff well now in the true spirit of today's FBI and DOJ the FBI and DOJ that have an absolute disdain or America and for justice he's defying a congressional subpoena a testify she will not testify the other story is about comedian Sacha Baron Cohen who used to be really funny when he did the Ali G show and something disgraceful that he did to Sarah Palin and also remember you can super chat with us there's that little icon down there it looks like a dollar sign chat stream is getting busy or you just loved the show donate a couple of bucks throw a couple of bucks our way I'll go to lunch and think about you know it'll what it'll do is it'll put your chat up in a very bold banner that graphic it'll make it stand out it'll go to the top of a priority list and that's the topic we'll discuss John ceiling good morning my friend Akash Singh Indian National Congress don't know what you mean by that but welcome to the show and Guf per lick says hi all well hi well I'm sure he does have seen it by now lisa page the texting mistress of embattled disgraced could be fired FBI agent Peter Strahm is refusing to testify now she was subpoenaed to testify before the House Judiciary and oversight committees they're they're doing a joint committee meeting committee hearing Bob Goodlatte the chairman of the House Judiciary is the lambing er Chuck Grassley is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Bob Goodlatte of the House lambing her blamming her now represented run DeSantis is slamming her as well here's what Bob Goodlatte said I'm reading from a fox news piece well lisa page is a key witness and it is critical that she come before our committees to answer questions as part of our investigation he said she had known for months he Bob Goodlatte said this quote it appears that Lisa Paige has something to hide he has known for months that the House Judiciary Committee has sought her testimony as part of our joint investigation with the Oversight Committee into decisions made by the Justice Department in 2016 and she has no excuse for her failure to appear I mean Goodlatte is right Ron de santis conservative representative from here in Florida's district is up on the Treasure Coast near Kennedy Space Center he's also running for governor of Florida he's the front-runner now on the Republican side and he'll be the big frontrunner he said he tweeted yesterday anti-trump FBI lawyer Lisa page defying a congressional subpoena because she doesn't want to answer questions or be held accountable pathetic representative Jim Jordan said lisa page ignores congressional subpoena once again showing the double standard one set of rules for regular Americans a different set of rules for the swamp and house freedom caucus leader representative mark meadows of north carolina said the statement from lisa pages attorneys could have been better summed up in one short sentence we're choosing to ignore a congressional subpoena now Paula Reid her attorney basically I won't review the whole statement because it's kind of pointless and useless and it's really just a big excuse her attorney is saying well we didn't have enough time to prepare for this testimony nonsense you've known you were under investigation since 2017 you were under OIG investigation you've known Congress wants to talk to you but your claim you don't have time to prepare well then they changed their statement a little bit and said well we needed documents from the FBI to prepare we went up to FBI headquarters Lisa Paige and her lawyer in this statement through her lawyer I'm paraphrasing we're one of the FBI headquarters and they made us sit around for three hours and they didn't give us anything now that I believe because the FBI won't even give documents to Congress nor will the Department of Justice so it the whole thing is just really really really pathetic really pathetic and John vivillon says Trump kicking ass at NATO he is but I want to do NATO tomorrow because I want to see what shakes out today we do the show so early in the day I think things are gonna get really frosty today with their responses and everything else but John I'm glad you brought it up because I know people will want to know about NATO but I I'm gonna do Nate her tomorrow cuz I think we'd have a lot more content and I'm sure Trump is gonna give us some singers I'm sure he's gonna insult people at the pointer I'm gonna laugh trying to tell you about it but let's wait on that one for one day and then these stories today are pretty topical well of course Lisa Paige is defying a subpoena now Peter struck is set to testify tomorrow for the joint committee biggie scheduled for something like two hours could go longer you don't he's probably gonna do he's gonna be as smug and defiant as he was in the closed-door Committee me hell why would he why would he tell the American people anything that he wouldn't tell Congress people in a classified setting in a closed-door setting I think is gonna be smug defiant plead the fifth now any other any other excuse me any other sitting FBI agent hold that thought would probably be fired well they already probably would have been fired see the FBI has a different administrative process for firing and other agencies under DOJ the DEA the Drug Enforcement Administration for example there's an administrative process to fire a DEA agent the FBI treats their agents more like private sector employees you're essentially they used to call it an at-will employee you can be fired at any time for cause well I would say while you're on the taxpayer clock bending your mistress fifty-thousand biased text messages against an investigative subject over your government phones yeah that's cause to be fired I would assume on any planet as the FBI James Comey former FBI director James Comey likes to say any reasonable prosecutor any reasonable person any reasonable and so we we we now at least a page in Peter Straub being incredibly defiant now let's be realistic Lisa page in all probability isn't defying the subpoena because she doesn't have some records she's defying the subpoena because she's screwed if she pleads the fifth she looks ridiculously guilty if she tells the truth he sinks a lot a lot of people and probably exposes Muller and you could bet your bottom dollar that right now Lisa page lisa page is being pressured from all sides from all sides and and mb Meditech i'm gonna read one comment right now it's pertinent so Rosenstein probably gave all the documents the committee didn't ask for my last try and meeting them out as slow as they can oh okay she's saying that they didn't that Rosenstein didn't provide document no i don't think they're gonna even slow drip the documents out i think whatever the FBI and DOJ has is so damning so damning that too many heads would roll and they are terrified doing damage control but again lisa page refusing to testify Peter struck being this mug the to be quite honest if they are they are proving proving that Jeff Sessions is completely completely checked out completely powerless powerless terrible terrible terrible we have zero leadership at the Department of Justice the FBI is a subordinate agency to the Department of Justice the FBI director reports to the United States Attorney General the United States Attorney General is doing nothing this this ridiculous dog and pony show appointing John Huber the US attorney in Utah special prosecutor to understand something there's a big difference between a special prosecutor and a special counsel a special counsel acts as you see with Muller as its own sort of independent mini Department of Justice if tremendous power too much power unconstitutional many argue that I now am convinced it's unconstitutional or critically though I wouldn't mind seeing this but second Special Counsel because the first special counsel is so corrupt so I think we need a second special counsel to investigate the first special counsel and then let's put special counsels to bet if DOJ is too incompetent or too powerless to do the job then let's change the top of DOJ all right that's a special counsel they run like a mini DOJ a lot of power a lot of power their own budget autonomist a special prosecutor that ubirr is is merely a United States Attorney from one district with an extended geographical mandate to work in a different district the problem there is Huber still reports to Rosenstein who's the number-two man a DOJ so nothing's gonna get done with Huber Sessions doesn't want to do anything Rosenstein doesn't want to do anything but ubirr is not gonna do anything well Brendon Hall you don't need to impeach Jeff Sessions he serves at the leisure of the President of the United States the president can fire the Attorney General because it's a rainy Tuesday and the president doesn't like rainy Tuesdays the executive branch the president the United States doesn't need any reason to fire either his FBI director he doesn't need any reason to fire his Attorney General he doesn't need any reason to fire any cabinet secretary Administrator anybody under his control now Meditec also just referenced the book Alan Dershowitz his new book the case against impeaching Trump the last thing Democrat in the u.s. I've spoken Alan Dershowitz several times over the last couple of weeks on this and he thinks that Robert molars investigation is patently unconstitutional he believes special councils are unconstitutional he believed and Starr was the under bill claim believe that Fitzgerald was during George W Bush and he believes Robert Muller is now and and Alan Dershowitz is being excoriated for this a longtime friend of his up on Martha's Vineyard that she wanted to stab him in the chest devam in the chest because of his support for Trump Yael Kaufman is asking me do I think Jeff Sessions is doing nothing because he knows more he has no Ria's reasons for his silence no that's one of those conspiracy theories no no a leader leads Jeff Sessions need to be up on a podium saying I realize there are issues we're getting to the bottom of it Jeff session i'ma tell you this for my sources in DC he is completely checked out I was asked by people about a month and a half ago very close to the White House he'll go easy on Jeff sessions they said there may be more going on behind the scenes we were just read into something there may be more go easy on sessions you might see something you like very soon about a week and a half after that they said nope false alarm he's completely useless he's doing nothing I had somebody very very close who the President of the United States say to me Jeff Sessions was the biggest mistake we ever made don't believe again I tell you every day don't believe these cueing on conspiracies and Jeff Sessions his stealthy assassin behind the scenes taking down the deep state Jeff Sessions was the deep state for decades in the Senate he's not taking anybody down Jeff Sessions thought he was gonna go out there prosecute legal we'd do some civil asset seizure go after immigration and have it easy run as a criminally centric Attorney General he never thought he's gonna have to deal with massive massive institutional government corruption Jeff Sessions maybe he knows more than he's letting on but he ain't gonna do anything about it okay Jeff Sessions is not this stealthy silent assassin in the background believe me believe me James farmer asks why was Rod Rosenstein and Giuliani smiling in each other like they're buddies well they know each other for a long time they both worked in the Department of Justice for many many many years that doesn't mean that they won't be adversarial Giuliani is on the offensive Rosenstein is on the defensive look they're friends we're colleagues they walk into a room with each other they can smile say hello I'm sure over the years their families have gotten to know each other they've gone to the same parties never easy people don't live in a bubble they don't live we don't live in this in this insulated bubble Giuliani's career began in the Department of Justice he was the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York he was a very well-known federal prosecutor prior to that appointment and so he and rod Rosenstein know each other he and James homie know each other he and Bob Mulder know each other for years these guys were senior DOJ people and colleagues but it doesn't mean that all that doesn't change that dynamic doesn't change and now they're adversaries because at the end of the day I think Rudy Guiliani is perplexed by all this and if you remember you probably don't but Rudy Giuliani's mayoral tea in New York back in the 1990s from 1990 or he actually was elected in 93 took office in January 94 in New York City as mayor elect mayor elections on off years and his his his tenure ran through to 2001 Rudy Giuliani uh was up for reelection two months after 9/11 and he was turned out I'm sorry my mistake he wasn't up for reelection Michael Bloomberg gave himself a third term Rudy Giuliani was turned out they wanted to extend his term but the City Commission didn't he City Council didn't want to do it a whole long story they did have been from Bloomberg's he paid for it but oh another show yeah but Giuliani ran New York City through the 1990s and if you remember anything about it that's what I was with the police department Giuliani's mayoral tea was really a microcosm of Trump's presidency he treated the media the same way as very hostile he ran the city ran as a Republican and people said he's too conservative but he actually ran as a Republican liberal interestingly enough Giuliani was pretty open-minded on social issues but he was a doer he was a results-oriented guy he just wanted to get from A to B in the most efficient way possible and make be a success so that's how Giuliani is not treating his role as Trump's attorney and Lisa Paige back to the topic at hand the FBI lawyer is not defying a correctional subpoena is giving him even more ammunition much more ammunition uh seven seven seven seven is saying after the ceteris disclosure yesterday Rosenstein is implicated is one of the most crooked of the crooks I don't believe it I don't believe that a DEA and an ATF agent he'll set rich mmm sorry I know Jack Burkman the radio host and TV host behind this I know jack I have been alike Jack the Jack's a really good guy and he's a really smart guy I think jack is way off on this one and I think that they are putting together very loosely collected investigative evidence to come up with a theory that'll get them some media attention hi I'm sorry I don't buy it and I don't buy it and I say that and I consider Jack a colleague and an ally I think it's a good guy and I like the guy I think this is just way out there and they're running dangerously close to implicating law enforcement people in something they didn't do not good for the country not good for the rich family or what's worse is that we have Lisa paid defying a congressional subpoena we have a Peter struck defying he's gonna he's gonna show up a Peter struck is gonna show up and he's gonna do what we expect him to do right he's gonna blow it off he's gonna make a mockery of it he's gonna treat it as unimportant he's gonna treat it as his little playground why wouldn't he why wouldn't he Andrew McCabe was criminally referred he's not been charged James Comey was criminally / DOJ by Congress he's not been charged Peter Straub gets to go to work every day in the FBI with a badge and a gun right he was escorted out of the building that one time probably cuz they were searching his office last I heard he's back in the building if he so wishes Lisa's truck was able to voluntarily leave the FBI we know that these agencies were weaponized against Donald Trump we know that now there's no mystery we know that the FISA warrant was obtained under false pretenses none of this is a secret anymore none of this is a secret I'm with David bars I'm gonna get the Sasha Baron Cohen in a moment but but none of this is a secret nobody wants to do anything though MD asks fair statement ah recession but what's next why doesn't Trump eject the useless son of a gun replace with somebody who actually acts let me address that very pertinent what we're talking about Jeff Sessions got there and he thought it was gonna be a typical Attorney General run prosecute some crimes have a couple of high-profile cases he never thought he had to take on the entire US government Steve many of those people colleagues of his for decades all right an older man he simply didn't want to do it he didn't want to do what he wants all this to go away the reason Trump can't just replace him is Mitch McConnell they're old friends he and Jeff Sessions metropic Connell has made it clear to the president I've been told this by many many sources in DC very close to the White House and it comports I was even told this by the chief of staff to a sitting u.s. senator who disagrees with this Mitch McConnell basically went to the President and said Jeff's our guy leave him alone we will never confirm anybody if you fire him if Jeff gets tired and he steps down on his own do what you want to do but until then he's staying Attorney General if you want to get if you want to get your judges and other appointments through and that's what it's all about Mitch McConnell and the other old guard senators want their buddy Jeff Sessions is AG and they don't want him to be embarrassed with the firing the help of the country and the confidence in federal law enforcement be damned and that's why and that's and that's why Jeff Sessions is still there and it's kind of deep State II write institutional senators not as sexy or conspiratorial as you think the secret information that's just that his buddies in the Senate don't want to see him fired in disgrace though they're playing a political game and saying hey look you're fired jeff Sessions we're not gonna confirm anybody else and then what happens well then you're stuck with rod Rosenstein really running the Department of Justice that one's a lose-lose for Trump he never should have appointed sessions ain't never could've appointed sessions hon David says it official then it's all been a toothless dog and pony show yeah it has it really really has the IG report if you really dig into the IG report the IG report really only finds administrative when you understand how to read these things and then you've dealt with them over the years doesn't indicate criminality nothing prosecutable in the IG report now with regards to Peter struck nothing he's done to date appears to be prosecutable sending text messages should be honorable but it's not criminal however if we find out that he altered the 302s the witness report and those alterations resulted in charges against people like general Flynn and George papadopolis well then we're talking about obstruction of justice then we're talking about abuse of authority then we're talking about criminal charges evidence tampering big ones then we're talking about something else the OIG is looking into that now do you have a lot of confidence I don't but if we had an ethical and honest system and an investigative process and infrastructure then we'd probably see criminal charges if big if they could prove they had probable cause that he altered the 302s that's a big if right now when you look at the totality of everything else going on but totality of everything else going on mb says so put the bloody Armand McConnell to convince sessions to move out how he's the Senate Majority Leader right now we've got a Supreme Court judge to get through and about a hundred other appointments to fill that need confirmation by the Senate politics being what they are right now McConnell's holding the cards on that sort of thing but you got to play his game you'll eventually have leverage on McConnell Trump will but that's just the ebb and flow nature of politics right now he does it now if more damning information surfaces that really put sessions at a negative light well then you have leverage on McConnell right then you go to McConnell and you say okay Mitch you're gonna convince him to step down or we're gonna bring this to light and we're gonna go to the American people and tell them that you're the reason he's staying as attorney general that you will not confirm anyone else Trump goes out there and he says hey Rosenstein is worse he's worse Mitch McConnell won't confirm anybody America what are you gonna do about it but there's a time to do that there's a time to do that Yael Cochran brings up an interesting point or cokeman Gail sorry if I said your name incorrectly or what about the face sir well the you talk about the FISA warrant application that Rosen Stein said well he didn't even read he just signed it terrible but he's getting away with it at any other point in history he'd be called the task on that but again Jeff Sessions is his boss that's the guy who should be calling them out and he won't he won't what are you gonna do when you've got these these DOJ former employees and mind you HIDA struck at least a page or not really senior people they're not really seeing your people they're you know middle to upper level management but they're not people that made policy struck with a senior investigator Paige was a lawyer reporting to senior people she wasn't an agent he was an a a gun and badge carrying sworn FBI agent she was merely a lawyer for the agency and hmm she she's 45 since thanks for the stream thanks for watching sorry I had to leave so quickly I know we're doing these early now um but least Paige wasn't even an agent he was a lawyer who happened to start sleeping with an agent who was in the node they both hated Trump what you find is that many many government agencies are institutionally Democrat why because Democrats like big government government employees who like power like big government they like to be your ruling overlords don't they CIA is institutionally left forget the State Department I don't think you could ever clean that out I'm never gonna be able to clean that out anything says makes sense John here's hoping I've always liked sessions but this is really scum damn up never thought sessions with a coward but that's the only word for this I have to agree I think Jeff Sessions a nice man I think he's an honorable man but he was a senator a lot of years and when you're one of a hundred it's very hard to be the top guy when you're one of a hundred and you were never the leader I mean you were never leadership majority leader he leader you weren't a governor you weren't in an executive position very hard to then take the reins of an executive executive level agency and not manage by consensus and that appears to be what Jeff Sessions did he fell back on his Senate experience and he managed by consensus consulting with Rosen Stein and Bruce or and James Comey at the time all people working against Donald Trump sessions was advised to recuse he was advised to do many many things to weaken him at DOJ and he did him he's again he was so used to being a senator one of a hundred and he didn't know how to step in and say no no no I want everything on my desk by 7:30 tomorrow morning I'm gonna go through it I'm gonna see what the hell went on here I'm gonna make a decision and if I determine heads are gonna roll they're gonna roll that's what a leader would have done what jeff Sessions wasn't in that role for 30-some odd years he was one of 100 senators who had to go along to get along the cut deals to get stuff done he was the wrong guy Rudy Giuliani was mayor of New York City many people call it the second most difficult political job in the country after president Giuliani would have gone in and said exactly that on my desk I want to know what the hell's going on I'm gonna make decisions and heads are gonna roll and I'm gonna decide who those heads are we appointed the wrong guy Attorney General we appointed the wrong guy 777 is asking them wired the upper echelon following and slow walking all the documents possibly jeopardizing themselves in the process jeopardizing themselves with whom there the people have to make the call to prosecute them robert muller is there a lie Trump is being advised by lawyers inside the White House to not appoint a second Special Counsel to go easy being given very bad advice that's why I keep saying Trump needs a second I don't he special counsels I hate them but he needs a second special counsel to investigate the first special counsel on the Department of Justice is the Office of Inspector General Michael Horowitz the Inspector General still reports the Jeff Sessions and as a result rod Rosen Stein the whole thing is corrupt can't investigate yourself when there's extensive wrongdoing in your ranks can't investigate yourself just can't do it that's why we need a second Special Counsel or we need the Office of Inspector General can no longer fall under the Department of Justice the OIG after this might need to be an independent entity who reports only to the President of the United States a lateral agency to DOJ mmm equal in power where it's where it's agency head is cabinet-level and they report to the president the chief of staff for the White House but I would even want them to report only to the president bypassing the chief of staff that's what I think we need now onto this story about Sasha Baron Cohen how disgusting so you remember this guy he did the Ali G show and it's really disappointing I thought it was pretty damn funny when he did it his interviews were great well gotten you a show for Showtime and the show is called what's the show called who what's the name of the show who is America well in it Cohen and is European frailty you know that little beta boy it's like the mock Americans conservative American goes after Dick Cheney it's a really bad one it's Sarah Palin now full disclosure I've gotten to know Sarah Palin I really like her she's a really nice woman great family really nice good people they did nothing to deserve their attacks when they ran in when she ran as VP in 2008 alongside John McCain Sarah Palin's a good person very down-to-earth very nice like I said I've gotten to know her spent a lot of time with her in DC I'm on month and a half ago we were at we Co hope sort of put together the same event where she was the keynote speaker and we have a mutual colleague a very close friend of mine is a close friend of hers and we got to know each other professional and actually spin a a really interesting David Sarah Palin at the Smithsonian when I was in D we got a private tour of the Smithsonian's gun collector awesome it was awesome that's a whole nother story for another show anyway Sarah Palin was asked by Sacha Baron Cohen I traveled across the country to be interviewed didn't know it was him he thought she was being asked to travel across the country when one of her daughter she often travels with one of her daughters he thought she was going across the country to be interviewed by a disabled veteran she thought she was helping out a veterans charity when she got there it was Cohen disguised as a disabled veteran mocking her mocking Americans and in effect mocking disabled veterans let me read you Sarah Palin's quote and quote out of respect for what I was led to believe would be a straight would be a thoughtful discussion with someone who had served in uniform i sat through a long interview full of Hollywood isms disrespect and sarcasm but finally had enough and literally physically removed my mic and walked out much to Cohen's pergrin the disrespect of our US military and middle-class Americans via Cohen's foreign commentaries under the guise of interview questions was perverse he went on to say mock politicians and innocent public personalities all you want if that lets you sleep at night but how dare you mock those who have fought and served our country truly sick a Sarah Palin's son served in combat in Iraq he's a combat veteran her daughter Bristol's had a baby Sarah Palin has a grandchild the father of which is the coda Meyer the Medal of Honor recipient this is a military family that sacrifice but even if they weren't how disgraceful how disgraceful of Sacha Baron Cohen a mock disabled veterans look I'm all for controversial comedy I am I'm a First Amendment God but I've got my First Amendment rights no and I think Sasha Baron Cohen is a reprehensible sick piece of trash who to use a disabled veteran persona that was blown up in combat buddy in their 20s that might have lost limbs how sick do you have to be to impersonate one of these American heroes so you can mock somebody and degrade them and insult them what kind of empty sick person does that Hollywood is is really devoid of morals and values and ethics there are disgusting they are disgraceful they are absolutely absolutely disgraceful and we'll take some comments on that but I want to go back to some of your comments on Muller you guys are fast and furious here and remember you could super chat you can donate a couple of bucks it'll pop up let's see you just saw a good one that I like we have so many comments on here mm-hmm well con David said he hoped for a Muller style investigation and investigated Hillary and her gang yet good luck that's not gonna I wanted to but no fate oh here's the one Morgan we're gonna Dundee said if I told government auditors at the bank where I work sorry but I defy you ha exactly if any other American Jim Jordan was right there's a different set of rules if any other American any other person in the world defied the law as much as people in this Department of Justice an FBI may be in prison already oh wait general Flynn has already had already plead guilty for a bogus charge of misstatements the badge is any American if you're a conservative if you're not aligned with Hillary Clinton's cabal you get criminally charged if you are you get immunity you get immunity Johnse Lenin says and about presumably Jeff Sessions a little possum let down Trump Trump felt obliged to give him the job from will replace um after the you after the Russian wheat run is over yeah I agree I agree he'll replace I mean yeah he was pressured to give him the job he was really pressured hi from cardiff UK will be 400 a well how you doing how are you doing love that we have our international audience brian London says I'm gonna have to wait till I see what Sasha actually puts out sure but you know what I don't need to Brian I respect that it's probably the better way to go but I know governor Palin I know she wouldn't lie about this because of her family's military sacrifices her word is good enough for me on this but you know what I encourage people watch it let me know what you think I do think however there are certain things that could be off-limits impersonating disabled veterans amok conservatives should be one of them and again you know what everybody's entitled to their opinion I'm entitled to mine thinking anybody that would do it as a reprehensible piece of trash let's see what else we had a lot on judge sessions I'm a lot on Jeff Sessions did you know it it goes to the I want to go back to Brian's point about seeing what he puts out doesn't that enable if we we on the right say well we want to see what he puts out doesn't that encourage Showtime to air it and them to profit off it and by the way there are Palin won Showtime not Arab but if they do air it he said and I agree with her they should donate all the proceeds to a veteran charity all the profits the veterans chair and I agree they should they won't they won't they're the far left they hate someone they won't but they should they should donate all the all the proteins II veteran charities but to Brian your point if we say well let's be more open-minded let's be better than the left let's let's see what they put out it makes some money doesn't that encourage them to just keep doing it look this other moron Michelle wolf that idiot who performed at the White House Correspondents Dinner who who insulted Sarah Huckabee Sanders for no reason her appearance by the way Michelle wolf is gross he's insulting Sarah Huckabee Sanders like honey look in the mirror now she had a special on show time where she was doing a salute to abortion for Independence Day here in the US that's sick that's sick I don't care what your view is on abortion doing a salute to the termination of of life that's sick the left is sick it's reprehensible female white conservative says I love Sarah Palin yeah she's very cool actually really a very cool person she's fun to hang out with as well the Alcott read says like Phil P Peter Fonda and disgusting veneer oh well exactly exactly yeah exactly Hollywood B Hollywood elites they hate us normal Americans they hate us they hate our guts they find us beneath them they find us low-rent they find us uncool no they're better in their little elite bubble they're better and their little elite bubble let's see I wonder why he never considered Giuliani 4aj before he hired sessions Anthony Emmerich asks he did prompt wanted Giuliani is the Attorney General Rudy Giuliani wanted to be Secretary of State and Trump just didn't think he was the right guy for Secretary of State and that's why Giuliani was not appointed attorney general he said no hurting down he didn't want it he said the Trump look I don't want to be Attorney General I've been at DOJ I want Secretary of State or nothing at all we'll be friends and I'll help you out and advise you from time to time so he was the first pick Rudy Giuliani that's some insight DC baseball this really only wanted to be Secretary of State what I was told is Rudy Giuliani had prostate cancer back in the day and it weakened him and he's dealt with some health issues um he's a bit older and Trump just didn't feel that he had the as Trump says stamina to be Secretary of State that offended Rudy a bit and I think he was a little a little insulted by that decided to not take a job of the administration at all I think in retrospect he realizes it was a bad move he should have taken the Attorney General spot country would be in a much better place yan moon dogle says michelle wolf said says god bless abortion and she was she was gross I'm gonna address Robert Clute supposedly there's a witness to the set bridge murder I don't believe it I know the guy doing this Jack Burkman he's a nice guy but he's a bit of a showman this is a very shoddy investigation a very loose fact pattern I'm not giving this any credibility whatsoever I think this is just more crazy conspiracy nonsense I put certain people in the limelight I like Jack I think he's a good guy we're colleagues on another thing I work on I think he's off base on this and then that's what I'll say on that I don't want to give it too much attention but we'll be 400 says what's my view on Britain overall great people dysfunctional leadership right now that's my view on Britain over Hull I love my friends from the UK they're great bear witty and they're funny and they're cool and they're you know many of them are as conservatives we are here in the US unfortunately they're just burdened by this function of leadership especially in London what Sadiq Khan is mayor that's my view on Britain no and it's often the case around the world people are great their government sucks let's say what do we got here Giuliani stated they regretted that decision Yale says about not taking a G's job yeah that's true that's true uh you know III worked with many people who know Rudy very well back in New York and I know him but not well fended for a room together it's how are you but not a person I interact with yes he regrets the decision I can tell you that from somebody I worked within the police department who's a good friend who's very close the Rudy very very close they actually work together now and he does regret it he does regret Anthony Emmerich says Trump sorted this chris Christie to will he really didn't that was Jared Kushner Trump couldn't have Chris Christie in the administration no no no if you guys know this but chris Christie was the US attorney in New Jersey who prosecuted and put Jared Kushner's dad in prison and that would have been a little awkward having those two guys in the White House together or in the administration together yeah that's why Christie didn't come in Jared Kushner and Chris Christie cannot stand each other Christie prosecuted and imprisoned Jared Kushner's dad yeah Michiko says nice forgotten man painting oh oh oh right behind me yeah that was given to me really here's an interesting story about that that um it's a print actually it's not the painting it was given to me by my former neighbor my former neighbor when I lived in Miami they owned a couple of art galleries they were in their 80s and they were Cuban couple and he was a member of Task Force 2506 that was the the pro-freedom rebels fighting Castro at the Bay of Pigs and so I would go to their house he would tell me these amazing stories show me these amazing photos John F Kennedy of course left them on the beach to die the Democrats were even dysfunctional back then he was really fascinating guy and when I moved out of the neighborhood he gave me that they gave me that as a going away as a going-away gift so I really loved it and a back story behind it is pretty damn cool there are really really nice people and in their late 80s now and still kicking still doing really well mmm scuse me my allergies are terrible and having a talk for an hour straight exacerbate but yeah they were their own greatest generation so thanks for asking about the friend it's a cool story behind it yeah Anthony Emmerich says oh yeah real awkward yeah I would have been pretty awkward having Jared Kushner senior advisor to the president having to sit in meetings the guy who put his dad in print though it's uh it's um yeah that would have been a little a little bit little odd Healy guy says asking for Jerusalem any and by the way thanks tuning in love having my international audience any hope for cleansing the USA from its Sodom and Gomorrah corruption gonna take a lot it's gonna take a lot to clean out the deep state are you ever gonna get them all out now because there's no political test for a government job and so is there a chance of reducing it yes is there a chance of reducing it significantly no is there a chance of cleaning it out totally ever never I don't wanna lie to you it's not going to happen not gonna happen hmm yeah and Anthony Emmerich says about Jared Kushner and Chris Christie chris Christie oh yeah technical knock that's a good way to phrase that I might have to steal that from you and use it not but you're right it is it was a technical knockout absolutely it really was there wasn't much um it wasn't much uh was it wasn't much there yet Ron Rufus and Sarah Palin is the kind of woman I'm looking at marry a bad choice feel pretty attractive in her 50s and a lot of fun funny let's see what else you guys have for me hmm oh you said about Britain as I am a Brit I cannot believe how bad it has become I tell America felt for eight years under Barack Obama but take a look at where we are now there is a light at the end of the tunnel you're starting to hear whispers about he am Boris Johnson aren't ya so look everything is cyclical right without Jimmy Carter look at the u.s. without Jimmy Carter we wouldn't had Ronald Reagan without Barack Obama we wouldn't have had Donald Trump it really needs to get pretty dark before people see the light and do the right thing when they when elections come around so don't get discouraged there's uh there's hope there's hope as chica says I just wish we'd see some equal justice to make an example of some of the worst ones all of America does well all of normal America does all of normal conservative America does liberal America and not so much not so much they love corruption and they love obstruction of justice as long as it suits their agenda but here's the more important part of your point that's chica we need to see some equal justice right now we need it there's a tremendous crisis of confidence tremendous crisis of confidence in federal law enforcement and if we can't trust the FBI if can't trust the DOJ well what do we trust our entire system falls down I'm not saying trust government but we have to at least know that investigations are being handled excuse me investigations and prosecutions are being handled fairly ethically and partially right now we don't know Don Zeeland says u.s. ambassador is talking up Trump Boris Johnson meeting further blow to embattled Teresa may yeah the other day I said to you guys I by the skin of her teeth threesome a might survive this I'm not so sure right now I am not so not so sure and this point it's looking like Gooden out def qk says and you're right it could still get worse in the UK we could still get socialist corbin god help you if that happens god help you if that happens we'll be 400 says well britain become great again I'm 16 and I don't have hope well first of all you're 16 I love that you're watching second of all AB 16 have hope have hope I was 11 years old when Ronald Reagan was in office I was just going into high school when he left and I'll tell you this have hope it gets better it gets better and now I watched Barack Obama nearly destroy this country boldly and throw it off a cliff booby as empathy Emmerich says it will keep your head high and then we got Donald Trump and Donald Trump righted the ship pun intended in he he undid eight years of Obama disaster go be in like a year eighteen months now hang in there you're sixty it's gonna get a lot better didn't get better because you see it you're the future of your country you're the future of Great Britain you're informed you're learning you're tuning in here you're consuming content you're doing your own research you're gonna be the informed voter who pushes socialism out don't get discouraged you are the front line of this you're the tip of the spear you're the one who's got to be out there driving the charge man I hope you run for office that's what you need to do or or or guys and girls like you need to do that you need to change things from the inside Christopher Eliot says greetings from the mountain State West Virginia one of the most beautiful places I have ever been West Virginia is absolutely beautiful one of the places on my short list to buy some property you guys have an absolutely beautiful beautiful state up there very good friend of mine went to high school with and he became a marine jag officer now lives he's a lawyer in Charleston he fell in love with your state moved his family there and set up his law practice they fell in absolute love with a beautiful beautiful place Allie client is telling Goldie don't ever lose hope they win if you lose stay strong absolutely 1177 talking about DOJ and FBI as foundations of truth and justice has crumbled how can it be rebuilt without transparency great question it cannot we need full transparency full full full transparency MV says here my first legal vote was for Ronald Reagan as president John we should cut him in mind I was too young wish it could have been mine but it couldn't I was little kid let's see what else we got here Wow we're getting more comments now let's see let's see let's see Merkel might be getting the boot Oh God helps though I hope so that is long overdue she's absolutely terrible and I love that Trump is caller an ally of Russia we're gonna do NATO tomorrow cuz I'm sure there gonna be some many many more good comments david blyde says anyone else think the baby trump balloon is cute if they are trying to make fun of him with that they failed oh it was an epic fail and trump's gonna have some funny comment about it and people here in the US are laughing at it and think Sadiq Khan is an absolute moron I'm a LESBIAN ask questions about that I see Corbin putting a leash on his front bench I really did it I did not I haven't I did not see that um this is interesting MD says to David Bligh that you see where a GoFundMe was set up and almost instantly fully funded for a Cintiq on baby below I wonder if they'll get that permitted I didn't see that but it's interesting and you know what we're gonna follow that and the thanks for bringing that to my attention we're gonna see if that thing gets going and if they pull the permit on that Christopher Elliott says we hate Jobe AMA yo man Cheney yes and that is joe Manchin's real name man Cheney he shortened that he was Italian I don't know why he did it I did enjoy mine a mansion is really all over the map isn't he now I'm hearing on very good authority that Joe Manchin is gonna be a yes vote on Cavanaugh to save his skin when he needs to run for re-election Oh Christopher Eliot let me ask you an honest question and I hope you respond to me here what's the what is the real sentiment toward Joe Manchin in West Virginia because a guy keeps getting elected I keep hearing you guys are over him you want to go with the Republican why does he keep getting reelected that's the part I don't get and why does he have support all right so you're telling me that that's fairly that's saying again Joe Manchin and for those that don't know Joe Manchin was governor of West Virginia he's now he's u.s. senator from West Virginia he's a conservative Democrat but then he'll caucus with Democrats and disappoint the more conservative base Oh Christopher Eliot is saying Joe Manchin walked through a parade last year and was booed continuously the second largest trade in West Virginia well he's got to either switch parties and become a conservative or he's got to go but what do you think Christopher the chances of West Virginians voting him out when he's up for reelection or if he doesn't switch over to the Republican Party and move hard right what do you think let's see and her head sucks is someone needs take an air rifle to that Trump balloon well in England you'd probably go to jail for like 2,000 years from your Lee possessing an air rifle I think I don't advise that don't advise that Christopher Elliott says southern West Virginia loves Joe Manchin why why do they love him is it more liberal down there like I said I think you have an absolutely beautiful state I just don't understand the political breakdown of your state geographically all that way okay so explain why northern West Virginia loves joe Manchin and southern lore that was Virginia hate some southern loves him rich Abe says joe jeff Sessions a swamp creature I think he's just really really beaten down by this one meditech says they'll presumably meaning the conservative Democrats will vote YES on Kavanagh because they know he lost already so what I was told yesterday by someone in Alabama who's got someone in Doug Jones the democratic senators office guy was just elected because Roy Moore was a terrible candidate Jones and mansion or yes votes they're working on Donnelly from Indiana because they know their constituency will not tolerate they are both in pretty conservative states now and their constituencies will not tolerate them being no votes being obstructionist I think that having all passes easily he's confirmed easel whose measly John's even said she can't be a flip-flopper forever well that's true that's true this for Elliott Cole Union loves Democrats difficult but why why the Democrats want to destroy the coal industry this is what I don't understand or they want to privatize well they will not make it public rather they want to socialize it under the Bureau of Land Management which generates about two billion a year off coal while regulating the private coal industry out of existence I'll never understand it rule B says my dad my father gave me the views I have today he is right minded and hates labor your dad sounds like an awesome guy you'd have him watch the show and chat with us we'd love to chat with him he's setting a great example for you look cool do you keep it up you keep it up at 16 be sewing for men or I don't know if you're an hour woman tire girl but I'm going to say man uh your father Udo well there you go go to your dad was a Royal Marine while that is badass please thank your dad for his service now I really want to have him on the show mr. president either does he can't understand why in the cold unions vote for Democrats don't know why any ended would vote for Democrats they want to crush private industry they eat the private sector left to their own devices Democrats would destroy the private sector private sector is evil to them evil to them especially the coal industry the environmental lobbies want to regulate it out of existence they want to put coal miners out of work they wanna make their family starve and have them go to work on wind farms is bizarre to me nope the grain asks are assault and Meursault knives available in the UK might be a market for an entrepreneur will be is a guy okay Goldie glad now I don't feel bad that I called you man I wouldn't talk about any knives in the UK they want to ban kitchen knives soon you're not going to be able to butter your bread in the UK you don't have to use a spoon until somebody gets cut with a spoon they're gonna ban those and then then they use your finger that's how you have to cut your steak terrible good bail garner says why does no one talk about Northern Ireland when it comes to how wrong gun control can be how to talk about the whole world where guns have been seized by oppressive governments terrible terrible terrible thing what do you mean Anthony I'm at a campaign against article 13 please explain I'm not seeing campaigning I'm oh oh oh this is in the EU I thought you were talking about something here okay let's see someone was arrested for carrying a potato peeler in the UK is that true that's true that is really sad oh my god hmm oh my god Felix code says I do have a question concerning Cole if I may assume in the trade war with China keeps on going in China's economy implodes from population problems and built in economic rackets what's question won't that hurt the coal industry no now now a lot of uses for clean coal here in the US a lot of uses I think in the US is gonna become the largest producer and exporter of oil by 2023 I saw a story that that timeline might even be accelerated I think the US energy industry is uh it's gonna be doing just fine hmm goldie says his interests in common there's a lot of tension in my school between Muslims and white boys they're always fighting yeah you guys have a problem with that over in the UK keep the faith man keep the faith in your dad as a royal marine I'm sure he you said he was a real marine ah once you're when one of those special units you're always in one of those special units I was out I had a drink last night with a buddy of mine he was SEAL Team six for five years 14 years in the Navy there 12 12 of those with the seals bill team four then over to SEAL Team six for his last five years two full years of combat deployments these guys are always heals or Royal Marines or US Marine credit to your dad again thank him for his outstanding outstanding service yeah look there there crystals talking about Democrats in West Virginia we have a lot we have a lot of comments coming in about that look Democrats or Christmas time can be forgetting his name correct I'm guessing it's the Elliott the Christopher is easy it's my brother's name and common name Elliott well I grew up in New York City a lot of different names how to learn how to pronounce him but yeah the Democrats here well I think they're an in major trouble during the midterm in the Supreme Court speak any unions the frame court just ruled against well couple of weeks ago before the end of the term ruled against public sector unions they can no longer charge dues to those who don't want to be members but those non-members can still benefit from the collective bargaining so I think you're gonna see more and more people drop out of the union why be part of the Union why deal with their socialism in their dictatorial style if you don't have to and you can still benefit from the collective bargaining I think that I think that there's gonna be a tremendous exodus from unions people left to their own devices and there should be there should be unions or I think unions useless I think they were necessary at a time we didn't have cell phone cameras and regulatory agencies making sure that factories and dangerous workplaces were safe but now they simply exist as an arm of the Democratic Party as a shadow form of socialist institution and they donate most of their money the Democrats I don't think there's any reason for union any more unions anymore but by garner says did you hear about the guy in the UK that defended himself from a robbery in his home and is now being charged with a racial hate crime I've seen many many of these stories I should say many but I've seen several of these come out of the UK they blow my mind living in the u.s. living in Florida State with the castle doctrine where we can use deadly force to stop home invasion this is in Spain to me this is insane to me bubi says I'm at a British veteran the other day for in World War two he spotted me wearing a Royal Marine shirt and said thanks for supporting and keeping support alive the different breed back man those guys different breed outstanding ladies still alive glad he's still alive even with our own problems some of what passes for law enforcement and justice in the UK seen on this side of the pond is downright terrifying MD said that I agree and again I know many police officers from the UK I'm in groups with them law enforcement groups haven't been in my PB I speak to them they're not happy about this remember something don't blame the police the police are instruments of domestic policy or left politicians set domestic policy the police would love to do their job which cops British cops and most hardcore cops I ever met what they are handcuffed unintended by liberal politicians amendment to the Constitution nationwide Castle Doctrine and stand-your-ground laws yeah we'd love to see it but then again an infringes on states rights it infringes on states right unfortunate but it does and the guy's been another awesome awesome show with you today I'll be back here tomorrow morning with you at 7:30 a.m. he's tuned in your questions ready pretty sure we're
