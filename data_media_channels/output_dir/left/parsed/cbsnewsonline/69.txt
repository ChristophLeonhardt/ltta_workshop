ARIZONA RIGHT NOW TO GOVERNOR 
DUCEY THERE WHO IS ANNOUNCING 
THE OFFICIAL REPLACEMENT FOR 
SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN WHICH AS 
OUR ED O'KEEFE HAS MENTIONED IS 
JON KYL. 
>> IT'S BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT 
WEEK FOR OUR STATE AND OUR 
COUNTRY. 
JOHN McCAIN WAS AN AMERICAN 
HERO, AND WE WERE VERY BLESSED 
TO HAVE HIM AS OUR SENATOR. 
WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE SIZE OF 
THE VOID JOHN McCAIN LEAVES. 
OUR PRAYERS AND OUR HEART 
REMAIN WITH CINDY McCAIN AND 
THE ENTIRE McCAIN FAMILY, AND 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO CELEBRATE 
THE LIFE OF JOHN MCCAIN. 
I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING 
THAT WE ALL HOPED TODAY WOULD 
NEVER COME. 
DECISION THIS IS AND THAT THERE 
IS NO REPLACING SENATOR JOHN 
McCAIN. 
BUT THE LAW REQUIRES ME TO DO 
IT AND THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA 
DESERVE REPRESENTATION IN THE 
U.S. SENATE. 
IT'S A DECISION THAT I MADE 
WITH CAREFUL AND THOUGHTFUL 
DELIBERATION. 
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, I RECEIVED 
A LOT OF ADVICE FROM PEOPLE 
ABOUT THIS SELECTION, MOST OF 
IT UNSOLICITED. 
HOWEVER, THE BEST PIECE OF 
ADVICE THAT I RECEIVED WAS FROM 
ANOTHER GOVERNOR WHO SAID JUST 
DO THE RIGHT THING, PICK THE 
BEST POSSIBLE PERSON REGARDLESS 
OF POLITICS. 
IT WAS REALLY GOOD ADVICE AND 
CLARIFYING ADVICE, AND IT MADE 
MY JOB EASY. 
AS I CONTEMPLATED WHO COULD 
BEST SERVE OUR STATE IN THE 
U.S. SENATE, I KEPT COMING BACK 
TO ONE NAME AND ONE PERSON, JON 
KYL. 
THERE IS NO ONE IN ARIZONA WITH 
THE STATURE OF SENATOR JON KYL. 
HE'S A MAN WITHOUT COMPARABLE 
PEER. 
WITH NEARLY TWO DECADES 
EXPERIENCE IN THE SENATE 
SERVING ALONGSIDE JOHN McCAIN, 
SENATOR KYL IS PREPARED TO HIT 
THE GROUND RUNNING. 
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS, 
SENATOR KYL HAS BEEN WORKING 
CLOSELY WITH THE WHITE HOUSE ON 
THE SENATE CONFIRMATION OF 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S 
NOMINEE TO THE U.S. SUPREME 
COURT, BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
NOW SENATOR KYL CAN CAST A VOTE 
FOR KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION. 
SENATOR KYL IS A BEACON OF 
INTEGRITY, HIGHLY REGARDED BY 
PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE 
AISLE, AND ABLE TO WORK ACROSS 
PARTY LINES TO GET RESULTS. 
THERE'S A REASON HE WAS 
CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BEST 
SENATORS IN THE COUNTRY. 
IT'S BECAUSE HE WAS. 
HE'S AN EXPERT ON THE MATTERS 
FACING ARIZONA, WATER, LAND USE 
AND ISSUES FACING OUR NATIVE 
AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. I 
WANTED SOMEONE WHO COULD ENTER 
AND LEAD ON THOSE 
CONVERSATIONS. 
FOR THOSE REASONS I'VE ASKED 
SENATOR JON KYL TO STEP FORWARD 
ONCE AGAIN IN THE SPIRIT OF 
SERVICE TO AID OUR STATE AND 
SERVE IN THE SEAT VACATED BY 
ARIZONA'S MOST BELOVED ADOPTED 
SON, JOHN McCAIN. 
PEOPLE AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME 
THAT THIS APPOINTMENT WILL 
SERVE THROUGH 2020. 
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT 
ASSURANCE FROM SENATOR KYL YET. 
WHAT I HAVE GOTTEN IS A 
COMMITMENT TO SERVE ARIZONA 
THROUGH AT LEAST THIS SESSION 
OF CONGRESS, AND IT'S MY HOPE 
THAT HE SERVES LONGER. 
THERE'S FAR TOO MUCH WORK 
BEFORE THE SENATE, WORK THAT IS 
IMPORTANT AND CONSEQUENTIAL TO 
OUR STATE AND OUR NATION, WORK 
THAT DEMANDS IMMEDIATE 
ATTENTION. 
IT'S NOT THE TIME FOR 
NEWCOMERS, AND NOW IS NOT THE 
TIME FOR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING. 
ARIZONA NEEDS SOMEONE WHO CAN 
HIT THE GROUND RUNNING ON DAY 
ONE. 
AND THAT'S JON KYL. 
THE FACT IS EVERY SINGLE DAY 
THAT JON KYL REPRESENTS ARIZONA 
IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE IS 
A DAY WHEN OUR STATE IS BEING 
WELL SERVED. 
AT THE MEMORIAL HERE IN THE 
STATE CAPITAL LAST WEEK SENATOR 
KYL SPOKE OF HOW SENATOR McCAIN 
ALWAYS PUT THE INTERESTS OF 
ARIZONA AND AMERICA BEFORE ALL 
ELSE. 
SENATOR KYL HAS DONE THE SAME 
THROUGHOUT HIS OWN SERVICE TO 
OUR STATE AND NATION AND WILL 
DO SO AGAIN. 
LASTLY, I WANT TO THANK CAROL 
KYL. 
SHE'S BEEN SO KIND AND GIVING 
AND SELFLESS, AND WE SO 
SINCERELY APPRECIATE HER. 
THANK YOU, CAROL. 
NO QUESTION THESE ARE DIFFICULT 
CIRCUMSTANCES, FOR WE ARE 
BLESSED TO HAVE THE LEADERSHIP 
AND STATESMANSHIP OF JON KYL AS 
WE COME TOGETHER AND MOVE 
FORWARD. 
THANK YOU. 
>> GOOD MORNING. 
I AM GRATEFUL FOR GOVERNOR 
DUCEY'S COMPETENCE IN ME AND 
HONORED TO ACCEPT THIS 
APPOINTMENT. 
WE'RE ALL SADDENED BY THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT REQUIRED THE 
APPOINTMENT AND APPRECIATE THAT 
THERE WAS ONLY ONE JOHN McCAIN. 
JOHN AND I SERVED THE PEOPLE OF 
ARIZONA TOGETHER FOR NEARLY 20 
YEARS, AND IN THAT SPIRIT, 
ALONG WITH SENATOR FLAKE, I 
WILL DO MY BEST TO ASSURE THAT 
ARIZONANS CONTINUE TO BE WELL 
REPRESENTED IN THE U.S. SENATE. 
THE GOVERNOR ASKED ME TO SERVE 
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM 
AND HAS MADE SOME VERY 
CONVINCING POINTS. 
I HAVE COMMITTED TO SERVING AT 
LEAST THROUGH THE SECOND 
SESSION OF THE 115th CONGRESS. 
I DO KNOW I WILL NOT SEEK THIS 
SEAT IN 2020, NOR ANY OTHER 
OFFICE IN THE FUTURE. 
I'M ACCEPTING THIS APPOINTMENT 
TO FILL A SEAT VACATED BY THE 
PASSING OF MY DEAR FRIEND 
BECAUSE OF MY SENSE OF DUTY TO 
THE STATE I LOVE AND THE 
INSTITUTION OF THE SENATE IN 
WHICH I SERVED FOR 18 YEARS. 
AND BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR ASKED 
FOR MY HELP AND BECAUSE I'M 
PUTTING MY COUNTRY FIRST, JUST 
AS THIS SEAT'S PREVIOUS 
OCCUPANT DID EVERY SINGLE DAY 
FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS. 
FOR NOW THERE IS MUCH 
UNFINISHED BUSINESS ON THE 
SENATE'S CALENDAR, INCLUDING 
CONFIRMATION OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S NOMINEE TO JUDICIAL AND 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH POSITIONS. 
I LOOK FORWARD TO GOING TO 
WASHINGTON AND GETTING TO WORK. 
THANK YOU, GOVERNOR. 
>> WE'LL TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS. 
LET ME START OFF WITH THE 
OBVIOUS ONE, GOVERNOR, I'VE 
KNOWN THE GOOD SENATOR [ 
INAUDIBLE  ]
THERE WAS SOME COMMENT THAT MR. 
McCAIN  ANOTHER 
OLD WHITE GUY. 
>> HOWIE, I WANTED TO PICK THE 
BEST PERSON REGARDLESS OF 
POLITICS. 
THERE IS BIG WORK TO BE DONE IN 
THE UNITED STATES SENATE. 
NO ONE IN ARIZONA HAS THE 
STATURE OF JON KYL. 
I ASKED, AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT 
HE ACCEPTED. 
>>REPORTER:  SENATOR, WHY 
COULDN'T YOU COMMIT TO SERVE 
PAST THE END OF THE YEAR, AND 
DOES YOUR LOBBYING WORK FOR A 
FEW YEARS NOW, DOES THAT IN ANY 
WAY IMPEDE YOUR ABILITY TO 
SERVE IN THE SENATE? 
>> THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND 
QUESTION IS, NO. 
AND THE REASON I DID NOT WANT 
TO COMMIT TO BE ON THE END OF 
THIS CONGRESSIONAL SESSION IS 
BECAUSE WHEN I LEFT THE SENATE 
ALMOST SIX YEARS AGO, I HAD NO 
INTENTION OF RETURNING. 
I NEEDED TO BE WITH MY FAMILY, 
TO COME BACK TO ARIZONA MORE 
AND TO BE AT THEIR SIDE. 
SO IN THAT SPIRIT I'M WILLING 
TO SERVE CERTAINLY THROUGH THE 
END OF THIS SESSION AT LEAST IN 
ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 
BUSINESS THAT IS CURRENTLY 
ONGOING IS TAKEN CARE OF. 
BUT I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A 
COMMITMENT AND BEYOND THAT. 
>>REPORTER:  GOVERNOR DUCEY, 
SHOULD SENATOR KYL STEP DOWN 
BEFORE 2020, ONE, WHO DO YOU 
THINK YOU WOULD APPOINT THEN, 
OR, TWO, WOULD YOU LEAVE THE 
SEAT OPEN UNTIL 2020? 
>> WELL, LIKE I'VE SAID, I'M 
HOPING THAT THE SENATOR WILL 
CONSIDER SERVING LONGER. 
I'LL FULFILL MY 
RESPONSIBILITIES AS THEY COME 
DUE. 
RIGHT NOW SENATOR KYL IS GOING 
TO BE HEADING TO SKY HARBOR 
AIRPORT TO FLY BACK TO 
WASHINGTON D.C. WE'RE WORKING 
WITH OUR SECRETARY OF STATE AND 
THE SECRETARY OF THE SENATE AND 
LEADER MCCONNELL TO HAVE 
SENATOR JON KYL SWORN IN TO THE 
UNITED STATES SENATE TO 
COMPLETE THE WORK OF THIS 
CONGRESS. 
>>REPORTER: [ INAUDIBLE 
] >>REPORTER:
>> I'VE BEEN CLEAR ON THAT FROM 
THE BEGINNING. 
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. 
I AM NOT IN THE UNIVERSE OF 
POTENTIALS FOR THIS. 
I LOVE THE JOB THAT I HAVE, AND 
I WANT TO RETAIN IT. 
WHEN I ACTUALLY CONSIDERED 
ENTERING PUBLIC LIFE, I WENT 
AND VISITED WITH SENATOR KYL AT 
THE TIME AND TOLD HIM I WAS 
THINKING OF GETTING INVOLVED IN 
PUBLIC SERVICE. 
AND THE FIRST QUESTION HE ASKED 
ME WAS DO YOU HAVE AN EXECUTIVE 
PERSONALITY OR A LEGISLATIVE 
PERSONALITY, AND I KNEW THE 
ANSWER IMMEDIATELY. 
I SAID AN EXECUTIVE 
PERSONALITY. 
HE SAID THEN DON'T CONSIDER 
CONGRESS, AND I'M GOING TO 
STICK RIGHT HERE. 
>>REPORTER:  GOVERNOR, YOU SAID 
THAT YOU WANTED TO MAKE THIS 
DECISION REGARDLESS OF 
POLITICS, BUT WITH ALL DUE 
RESPECT, SENATOR KYL HAS BEEN 
WORKING WITH THE WHITE HOUSE IN 
AN APPARENTLY -- INHERENTLY 
POLITICAL PROCESS WITH THE 
KAVANAUGH APPOINTMENT. 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN 
SAY THIS IS A NON-POLITICIZED 
APPOINTMENT WHEN HE'S SOMEBODY 
WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED IN THE 
POLITICAL PROCESS. 
>> I THINK IT IS IN PICKING THE 
BEST POSSIBLE PERSON, THE 
PERSON WHO HAS THE EXPERIENCE, 
THAT HAS DONE THE JOB AND CAN 
SOOTHE THE CITIZENS IN TERMS OF 
WHAT THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH. 
JON KYL HAS A RECORD, HE'S 
WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE, AND HE 
HAS BEEN LAUDED BY BOTH SIDES 
OF THE AISLE. 
AND HE'S GOING TO DO A GOOD 
SCWROOB FOR THE STATE OF 
ARIZONA -- A GOOD JOB FOR THE 
STATE OF ARIZONA. 
>>REPORTER:  SO YOU'RE NOT 
PICKING HIM JUST BECAUSE HE'S 
VOAGHTD FOR KAVANAUGH? 
>> I'M PICKING HIM BECAUSE HE'S 
THE BEST PERSON. 
>>REPORTER:  
PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE LATE 
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN'S FAMILY, 
CLEARLY YOU HAVE GIVEN THEIR 
FEELINGS AND THEIR OPINIONS. 
 
>> WELL, OF COURSE. 
I THINK YOU SAW LAST WEEK WAS 
ALL ABOUT HONORING SENATOR JOHN 
McCAIN, OF COMFORTING THE 
FAMILY AND THE CITIZENS OF 
ARIZONA. 
I DO WANT TO HOLD THOSE 
CONVERSATIONS IN CONFIDENCE, 
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THE 
CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH 
CINDY THIS MORNING WAS 
INCREDIBLY POSITIVE AND I WOULD 
POINT YOU TO HER OWN SOCIAL 
MEDIA FEED AS TO HER RESPONSE 
TO THIS DECISION. 
>>REPORTER:  HOW WOULD YOU 
DESCRIBE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP? 
>> I DON'T REALLY HAVE A 
RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 
I HAVE ONLY MET HIM ON ONE 
OCCASION SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. 
BUT IT IS MY HONOR TO BE 
HELPING ON THE KAVANAUGH 
NOMINATION. 
I BELIEVE IN JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 
AND IN THAT CAPACITY I'VE BEEN 
ABLE TO SUPPORT NOT JUST JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH BUT THE 
ADMINISTRATION AND I THINK THE 
PROPER ADMINISTRATION OF 
JUSTICE. 
>>REPORTER:  SENATOR, YOU 
DESCRIBED HIS STYLE AS BOORISH 
AND AS HIS OWN WORST ENEMY. 
DO YOU STILL STAND BY THAT? 
>> I THINK SOMETIMES HIS DESIRE 
TO JUMP INTO THE MIDDLE OF A 
FIGHT OR MAYBE EVEN CREATE A 
FIGHT -- BY THE WAY, THAT 
REMINDS ME OF SOMEBODY. 
BUT SOMETIMES THAT CAN BE 
DETRIMENTAL TO WHAT HE'S TRYING 
TO ACHIEVE, AND THAT'S WHAT I 
SAID AND I STAND BY THAT 
COMMENT. 
>> WE'RE HEARING FROM NEWLY-
APPOINTED SENATOR JON KYL OF 
ARIZONA, REPLACING THE SEAT 
LEFT OPEN BY THE LATE JOHN 
McCAIN. 
I WANT TO BRING IN CHIEF 
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT ED 
O'KEEFE WHO JOINS ME NOW. 
ED, WE KNOW -- WE JUST HEARD 
FROM SENATOR KYL SAYING WHEN I 
LEFT THE SENATE IN PARTICULAR, 
I WENT INTO MORE OR LESS SAYING 
THAT HE WENT INTO LOBBYING WITH 
THE UNDERSTANDING THAT HE WOULD 
NEVER RETURN TO THE SENATE. 
IS IT PROBLEMATIC, THOUGH, THAT 
HE'S BEEN HELPING -- SEEING THE 
CRITICISM ALREADY OF SOME FOLKS 
TO THE RIGHT SAYING -- TO THE 
LEFT SAYING HE'S BRINGING THE 
COURTS TO THE RIGHT, WILL THAT 
BE A PROBLEM FOR HIM? 
>>REPORTER:  WELL, LOOK, I 
THINK WHAT THIS ULTIMATELY 
PROVES NOW IS THAT DUCEY HAS 
BASICALLY PUT A BAND AID ON 
WHAT COULD BECOME A BIGGER 
PROBLEM. 
A FEW THINGS TO UNPACK HERE. 
YES, ARIZONA NOW HAS A RELIABLE 
REPUBLICAN SERVING IN THE SEAT 
ONCE HELD BY JOHN MCCAIN. 
AND, YES, HE WILL PROBABLY 
ALMOST CERTAINLY VOTE FOR BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
SO THAT CHECKS ONE BOX OF 
CONCERN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
MITCH McCONNELL UP HERE IN 
WASHINGTON. 
HE THEN, THOUGH, SAYS THAT HE 
IS ONLY COMMITTED TO SERVING TO 
THE END OF THE 115th CONGRESS. 
THAT IS BY MY MATH JANUARY 3rd 
OR JANUARY 4th OF NEXT YEAR 
WHICH COULD MEAN THAT DUCEY, 
SHOULD HE BE RE-ECTOMIED IN 
NOVEMBER OR THE GUY WHO BEATS 
DUCEY IN NOVEMBER WOULD HAVE TO 
POTENTIALLY PICK A NEW SENATOR 
YET AGAIN COME JANUARY. 
SO THIS NOW RAISES THE STAKES 
ARGUABLY FOR ARIZONA'S 
GOVERNOR'S RACE WHICH IS NOT 
AMONG THE MOST COMPETITIVE, BUT 
NOW CERTAINLY COULD DRAW MORE 
ATTENTION TO DUCEY AND TO HIS 
DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT DAVID 
RIVERA INL IS THE GUY'S NAME. 
AND SO THIS IS NOT THE END OF 
THIS. 
THIS IS POTENTIALLY NOW GOING 
TO BE A BIGGER PROBLEM GOING 
FORWARD SHOULD KYL DECIDE TO 
LEAVE. 
YOU ALSO HEARD HIM THERE SAY 
HE'S ONLY MET PRESIDENT TRUMP 
ONCE AND BASICALLY GAVE MILK 
TOAST ENDORSEMENT OF THE 
PRESIDENT SAYING THAT HE'S GOT 
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT HIS 
TEMPERMENT AND DOESN'T KNOW 
MUCH MORE ABOUT HIM BECAUSE 
THEY'VE ONLY REALLY CHATTED ONE 
TIME. 
AND, YES, HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 
IN THE HEARING ROOM TODAY 
ALONGSIDE BRETT KAVANAUGH 
SERVING AS HIS SO-CALLED SHERPA 
OR ASSISTANT ESSENTIALLY 
THROUGHOUT THE CONFIRMATION 
PROCESS, AND NOW HE'S NOT 
THERE. 
BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT HE'S 
PROBABLY ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING 
TO VOTE FOR KAVANAUGH. 
SO REPUBLICANS AT LEAST HERE IN 
WASHINGTON ARE GOING TO BE 
HAPPY ABOUT THIS. 
REMEMBER, DUCEY WAS HERE IN 
WASHINGTON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY 
FOR THE MEMORIAL SERVICES HERE 
AT THE CAPITOL AND AT THE 
NATIONAL CATHEDRAL. 
THAT GAVE HIM PLENTY OF TIME TO 
CONSULT WITH THE WHITE HOUSE, 
WITH LEADER MCCONNELL AND OTHER 
REPUBLICANS ABOUT THIS CHOICE. 
ULTIMATELY HE HAS MADE A SAFE 
CHOICE, SOMETHING THAT 
MAINTAINS STATUS QUO THROUGH AT 
LEAST JANUARY, BUT IT'LL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE IF KYL 
COMMITS TO GOING MUCH BEYOND 
THAT. 
HE IS A LUCRATIVE LOBBYIST, 
MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS NOW 
COMPARED TO THE SIX-FIGURE 
SALARY HE MADE FOR MORE THAN 20 
YEARS IN THE SENATE. 
THAT'S PROBABLY PART OF THE 
REASON HE DOESN'T WANT TO HANG 
OUT HERE TOO LONG. 
>> LOOKING AT THE COMMENTS ON 
TWITTER, TECH FOLKS ARE PUSHING 
BACK SAYING HE HAD A HUGE HAND 
IN FACEBOOK, LOOKING INTO 
ANTIBIAS ON THE RIGHT. 
SO IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO 
EXACTLY HOW THAT SHAKES DOWN. 
ED O'KEEFE, I WANT TO THANK YOU 
SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. 
ED, WE'RE GOING TO CHECK BACK 
IN WITH YOU IN A BIT. 
WE'LL TAKE YOU BACK TO THE 
KAVANAUGH HEARING AND WE WILL 
HAVE MORE REACTION OUT OF THE 
HEARING. 
>> THE NUMBER THE NATIONAL 
ARCHIVES RELEASED AFTER THE 
REVIEW, ONE REASON IS BECAUSE 
WE'RE ABLE TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO 
CALL OUT THE EXACT DUPERY CAT E-
MAILS INSTEAD OF HAVING TO -- 
DUPLICATE E-MAILS INSTEAD OF TO 
READ 13 TIMES AN E-MAIL JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH SENT TO 12 WHITE 
HOUSE COLLEAGUES, WE ONLY HAD 
TO READ THE E-MAIL ONCE. 
SECOND, THE 6% FIGURE COUNTS 
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PAGES 
OF IRRELEVANT STAFF SECRETARY 
DOCUMENTS THAT WE NEVER EVER 
REQUESTED OR NEEDED. 
MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE RECEIVED 
100% OF THE DOCUMENTS WE 
REQUESTED FROM JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S TIME AS AN 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH LAWYER. 
AND WHILE WE MAY HAVE RECEIVED 
99% OF JUSTICE KAGAN'S WHITE 
HOUSE RECORDS, WE RECEIVED ZERO 
RECORDS FROM HER MOST RELEVANT 
LEGAL SERVICE AS A SOLICITOR 
GENERAL, THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT'S TOP SUPREME COURT 
ADVOCATE, WE RECEIVED MUCH LESS 
THAN 99% OF RECORDS AS A 
LAWYER, AND WE DIDN'T RECEIVE 
60,000 E-MAILS FROM JUSTICE 
KAGAN, SO 99% IS AN 
OVERESTIMATE. 
AND EVEN THOUGH WE NEVER 
RECEIVED THEM, JUSTICE KAGAN'S 
SOLICITOR GENERAL RECORDS WERE 
MUCH MORE NEEDED AT THE TIME 
BECAUSE KAGAN WAS A BLANK SLATE 
AS A JUDGE, INSTEAD, UNLIKE 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, WITH HIS 12 
YEARS OF JUDICIAL SERVICE AND 
OVER 10,000 PAGES OF JUDICIAL 
WRITINGS ON THE NATION'S MOST 
IMPORTANT FEDERAL CIRCUIT 
COURT, JUSTICE KAGAN HAD ZERO 
YEARS OF JUDICIAL SERVICE AND 
ZERO PAGES OF JUDICIAL
