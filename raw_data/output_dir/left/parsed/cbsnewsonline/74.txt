>> USA, USA, USA! 
 
>> EVANSVILLE, YOU ARE VERY 
SPECIAL PEOPLE. THANK YOU, 
INDIANA. 
THANK YOU. 
>>  
>> WE HAD GREAT SUCCESS IN 
INDIANA, AS YOU KNOW. 
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE.
AND, WE REALLY HONOR YOU, YOU 
ARE VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE. 
THANK YOU, VERY MUCH. 
>>  
>> I KNOW YOU WELL. 
I KNOW YOU LOVE OUR COUNTRY. 
YOU ARE PROUD OF OUR HISTORY. 
AND YOU ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT
AMERICAN FLAG. 
>> 
USA! 
USA! 
USA! 
 
>> THIS IS A REALLY INCREDIBLE 
TIME FOR YOUR COUNTRY. 
THIS IS A TRULY AMAZING PERIOD 
OF TIME. 
WE HAVE THE BEST ECONOMY IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
>>  
>> FACTORIES ARE REOPENING, 
JOBS ARE POURING BACK INTO THE 
UNITED STATES. 
>>  
>> WE ARE PUTTING YOUR GREAT 
INDIANA COAL MINERS AND 
STEELWORKERS BACK TO WORK. 
>>  
>> WE ARE RECLAIMING OUR 
NATIONS PROUD AND YOU 
FRACTURING HERITAGE AND PUTTING 
TARIFFS ON AND PRODUCERS WHO 
CHEAT OUR WORKERS AND CHEAT OUR 
COMPANIES. 
NOT FAIR. 
NOT FAIR. 
AS PRESIDENT McKINLEY ONCE SAID,
A LONG TIME AGO, WE BELIEVE IN 
AMERICAN WORK FOR AMERICAN 
WORKERS. 
AMERICAN WAGES FOR AMERICAN 
LABORERS. 
AND AMERICAN HOMES FOR AMERICAN 
CITIZENS. 
>>  
>> JUST THIS WEEK WE MADE 
ANOTHER CHILLY HISTORIC 
ANNOUNCEMENT. 
WE ARE REPLACING NAFTA WITH A 
BEAUTIFUL BRAND-NEW U.S. AND 
MEXICO TRADE DEAL. 
>> 
>> AS WE SPEAK. 
CANADA, AND WE LOVE CANADA, 
RIGHT? 
BUT THEY HAVE GOT TO GET RID OF 
THOSE BARRIERS AND THOSE BIG 
TARIFFS. 
CANADA SHOWED UP AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
>>  
>>  USA! 
USA! 
USA! 
 USA! 
USA! 
USA! 
>> WHERE THE HELL DID SHE COME 
FROM? 
>> 
>> AND NOW TOMORROW YOU ARE 
GOING TO READ HEADLINES, TRUMP 
HAD PROTESTERS ALL OVER THE 
PLACE. 
BECAUSE OF ONE PERSON. 
ONE PERSON. 
MAJOR PROTEST. 
BUT ARE THEY GOING TO TALK 
ABOUT THE THOUSANDS AND 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INSIDE OF 
THIS ARENA AND OUTSIDE OF THE 
ARENA, WHERE WE HAD TO PUT 
SCREENS? NO. 
BECAUSE THINGS ARE HAPPENING. 
LET ME JUST TELL YOU REALLY 
QUICKLY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT 
DID HAPPEN. 
LAST WEEK, YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT
, BECAUSE IT GETS READINGS THEY 
PUT IT ON TELEVISION. 
IF IT DIDN'T GET READINGS THEY 
WOULD NOT BE ON. 
BUT LAST WEEK, YOU SAW I WAS IN 
THE GREAT STATE OF WEST 
VIRGINIA. 
WE WERE IN A FANTASTIC ARENA. 
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT SMALLER 
THAN THIS. 
IT WAS A GREAT PLACE. 
WE HAD CROWDS THAT WERE 
INCREDIBLE. 
AND THE ENTHUSIASM, I HATE TO 
TELL YOU, THE ENTHUSIASM THAT 
YOU HAVE HERE WAS THE SAME AS 
IT WAS IN WEST VIRGINIA. 
>>  
>> AND THE FEELING NEW YORK 
TIMES, AND BY THE WAY, IF I WAS 
NOT HERE THEY WOULD BE OUT OF 
BUSINESS. 
THE WASHINGTON POST AND THE NEW 
YORK TIMES. 
CNN. 
SO A WRITER FOR THE NEW YORK 
TIMES THAT PRETENDS SHE KNOWS 
WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT, BUT 
HAS NOT GOT A CLUE, I AM 
TELLING YOU THE ENTHUSIASM WAS 
THE SAME. 
THE PLACE WAS PACKED. 
SHE MADE THE STATEMENT THAT 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS 
DISAPPOINTED TO SEE SOME EMPTY 
CHAIRS. 
MAYBE THEY WERE GOING TO THE 
BATHROOM. 
AND LISTEN, AND HE WAS SO 
DISAPPOINTED THAT THE TONE -- 
ABOUT THE TONE IN THE ROOM. 
BUT WE LEFT THAT EVENT AND 
THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING. 
THEY ARE JUST TERRIBLE 
DISHONEST PEOPLE. 
TERRIBLE. 
NOT ALL OF THEM. 
HONESTLY, NOT ALL OF THEM. 
I WOULD SAY 85%. 
SO, WE MADE A GREAT DEAL WITH 
MEXICO. 
AND, AS YOU KNOW, CANADA DID 
NOT WANT TO DO WHAT NEEDED TO 
BE DONE. 
AND AFTER THE DEAL WAS MADE WITH
MEXICO, THE CAME ALONG AND THEY 
ARE NEGOTIATING AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE RIGHT NOW. 
IN OUR TERRITORY. 
IT COULD HAPPEN. 
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
AND IF IT DOES NOT HAPPEN, WE 
WILL PUT TARIFFS ON THE CARS 
COMING IN FROM CANADA AND THAT 
WILL BE EVEN BETTER. 
BUT, I THINK IT IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN. 
WE HAVE DEVELOPED A GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP. 
WE LOVE CANADA BUT THEY HAVE 
GOT TO TREAT US FAIRLY. 
AND THEY HAVE NOT HERDED US 
THOROUGHLY. 
I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WITH 
CANADA. 
DAIRY PRODUCTS. 
THEY PUT TARIFFS ON OUR DAIRY 
PRODUCTS GOING INTO CANADA, 
ALMOST 300%. 
WE CANNOT HAVE THAT. 
WE CANNOT. 
AND A LOT OF OTHER BARRIERS. SO 
WE WILL OPEN IT UP AND WE WILL 
BE, MAYBE EVEN BETTER. 
EITHER WAY IT WILL WORK 
BEAUTIFULLY. 
THAT, I PROMISE. 
BECAUSE, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. 
THIS COUNTRY IS TIRED OF BEING 
RIPPED OFF BY OTHER COUNTRIES. 
>>  
>> TIRED OF IT. 
AND WE ARE DOING SOME GREAT 
DEALS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES AS 
WELL. 
YOU HAVE BEEN READING ABOUT IT. 
THEY ARE GETTING DONE ONE BY 
ONE. 
AND WE COME OUT ALMOST BETTER. 
THAT IS THE WAY IT IS. 
WE ARE THRILLED TO BE JOINED 
TONIGHT BY MANY OF YOUR STATES 
GREAT REPUBLICAN LEADERS. 
AND I HAVE TO SAY, I HAVE TO 
SAY, AND MEN WHO FOLLOWED A 
VERY HARD ACT. 
OUR GREAT VICE PRESIDENT, MIKE 
PENCE. 
BUT A MAN WHO FOLLOWED MIKE, 
THAT IS A HARD ACT TO FOLLOW. 
MIKE DID A GREAT JOB AS YOUR 
GOVERNOR AND HE IS DOING A 
GREAT JOB FOR US NOW IN 
WASHINGTON. 
AND, YOU HAVE A GOVERNOR, ERIC 
HOLCOMB WHO IS DOING A 
FANTASTIC JOB. 
>>  
>> THANK YOU, VERY MUCH, ERIC. 
GREAT JOB. 
AND MRS. HOLCOMB, THANK YOU, 
VERY MUCH. 
YOU ARE A GREAT TEAM. 
A GREAT TEAM. 
PEOPLE THAT HAVE REALLY HELPED 
ME IN WASHINGTON. 
WE DID A LOT OF THINGS, 
INCLUDING CUTTING YOUR TAXES. 
THE BIGGEST TAX DECREASE EVER. 
>>  
>> CONGRESSMAN LARRY BOUCHER AND
TODD, THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
ALSO, A VERY SPECIAL INDIANA 
CHAIR, KYLE. 
THANK YOU, KYLE. 
GREAT JOB. 
KYLE, HOW ARE WE DOING IN 
INDIANA? 
YOU ARE GOING TO BE JOE 
DONNELLY. 
YOU WILL BE JOE DONNELLY. 
YOU HAVE TO BECAUSE WE NEED THE 
VOTES. 
JOE IS NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR US 
OR ANYBODY. 
HE IS MAYBE GOING TO VOTE FOR A 
GREAT JUDGE RIGHT NOW. 
BUT, BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THAT, 
I WANT TO BRING A PERSON UP TO 
THE STAGE WHO HAS REALLY DONE 
AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 
HE WENT THROUGH A PRIMARY WITH 
A COUPLE OF REAL PROS. 
AND, I HAVE GOT TO SAY, THEY 
HAVE BEEN SO FANTASTIC. 
WE DID SO WELL. 
AND WE APPRECIATE IT. 
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING 
ABOUT. 
YOU KNOW. 
INCREDIBLE. 
INCREDIBLE. 
BUT, HE WENT THROUGH AND HE DID 
GREAT. 
PEOPLE LOVED HIM. 
HE HAS BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL 
BUSINESSMAN. 
AND THAT REALLY IS WHAT OUR 
COUNTRY NEEDS. 
A LOT OF THIS IS BUSINESS AND 
IT IS COMMON SENSE. 
AND I JUST SAW A POLL A LITTLE 
WHILE AGO, A REAL POOL. 
THEY HAVE THOSE FAKE 
SUPPRESSION POLLS. 
IT IS CALLED A SUPPRESSION POOL.
THEY MAKE YOU THINK YOU CANNOT 
WIN SO YOU GO TO SEE A MOVIE. 
DON'T GO TO SEE A MOVIE. 
THEY HAVE SAID IT WOULD BE 
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO GET 270 
VOTES. 
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THEY SAID. 
REMEMBER THE LINES FROM NBC, 
WHICH IS PROBABLY WORSE THAN 
CNN? 
THE WORD IS THAT THEY ARE 
FIRING THE HEAD OF NBC. 
WHAT A GREAT THING TO DO. 
THAT IS THE WORD. 
WHO KNOWS. 
WITH THESE PEOPLE YOU NEVER 
KNOW. 
BUT, TAKE A LOOK. 
TODD, EVERYBODY, GOVERNOR, LOOK 
AT HOW MANY CAMERAS YOU HAVE 
BACK THERE? 
THIS IS LIKE THE ACADEMY 
AWARDS. 
HE CAN'T GET ENOUGH. 
WHEN YOU START SCREAMING FAKE 
NEWS YOU SEE THOSE RED LIGHTS 
GO OFF FOR A WHILE. 
THEY HAVE TECHNICAL 
DIFFICULTIES AND THEN THEY GO 
BACK ON. 
>>  
>> YOU KNOW, IN THE STUDIO, 
THEY SAY HE IS ABOUT READY TO 
GO. 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE 
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. 
AND THEN THEY COME BACK AND SAY 
THAT THEY ARE BACK. 
BUT WHAT THEY HAVE TO PUT UP 
WITH. 
IT IS NOT EASY FOR THEM EITHER. 
IT IS TOUGH TO HAVE A NETWORK 
WHERE YOU ARE CALLING THEM FAKE 
NEWS AND THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO 
BE PROUD. 
THAT JUST SHOWS THAT WHEN YOU 
HAVE GOOD RATINGS, YOU CAN SAY 
ANYTHING. 
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS. 
THEY HAVE GOOD RATINGS. 
FINALLY, I JUST WANT TO SAY, I 
WANT TO GET MIKE UP HERE. 
HE IS A SPECIAL MAN AND HE IS 
GOING TO BE A TRULY GREAT 
SENATOR. 
MIKE, PLEASE. 
>> 
>> NEVER A DULL MOMENT IN THIS 
PURSUIT, IS IT? 
>> I LOVE WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
SAID. 
WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS YOU CANNOT 
DO SOMETHING, FOR SOME OF US, 
IT CAUSES US TO WORK EVEN 
HARDER. 
>>  
>> WHEN I WATCH THIS MAN 
CLEARED THE FIELD BACK IN 2016, 
WHEN THEY SAID IT COULD NEVER 
BE DONE, -- 
>>  
>> THERE WAS NOT ONE PERSON ON 
THAT STAGE THAT COULD HAVE 
BEATEN HILLARY CLINTON, OTHER 
THAN THIS MAN HERE. 
>> 
>>  
>> THE OTHER THING THAT YOU 
NEED TO KNOW, POLITICIANS, TOO 
OFTEN, SAY SOMETHING AND THEN 
THEY DON'T FOLLOW UP ON IT. 
THIS MAN MAKES PROMISES AND 
KEEPS THEM. 
>> 
 
>> AND HE NEEDS A TRUE ALLY. 
NOT SOMEBODY THAT SAYS SOMETHING
WHEN YOU ARE IN INDIANA THE -- 
INDIANA AND DO SOMETHING 
DIFFERENTLY IN DC. 
JOE DONNELLY VOTED AGAINST TAX 
REFORM. 
AS A CONGRESSMAN, HE VOTED FOR 
OBAMACARE. 
AND THEN, WHEN HE COULD HAVE 
HAD THE DECIDING SO, HE VOTED 
AGAINST REPEALING IT. 
HE VOTED FOR THE IRANIAN DEAL. 
AND THANK GOODNESS WE UNDID 
THAT. 
IT IS A SAD STORY. 
HE PROMISED A DREAM. HE 
PROMISED TO DRAIN THE SWAMP. 
I WANT TO BE AN ALLY. 
YOU CAN PROMISE WHEN I GET 
THERE THAT I WILL BE GOING 
THERE FOR THE RIGHT REASONS. 
>>  
>> I AM NOT GOING THERE FOR THE 
PAY OR THE PERKS. 
OR THE PENSIONS THAT THEY GET, 
LIKE NONE OF THE REST OF US DO. 
I AM GOING THERE TO MAKE THIS 
MAN HAVE AN ALLY THERE THAT YOU 
CAN COUNT ON EVERY TIME. 
>>  
>> SO, GET YOUR FRIENDS, GET 
YOUR NEIGHBORS OUT. 
I AM GOING TO NEED HELP TO TAKE 
IT ACROSS THE FINISH LINE. 
JOE HAS GOT TO GO. 
JOE HAS GOT TO GO. 
JOE HAS GOT TO GO! 
>>  JOE HAS GOT TO 
GO! 
JOE HAS GOT TO GO! 
>> THANK YOU ALL. 
I WILL SEE YOU. 
>>  
>> HE WILL BE A GREAT SENATOR. 
A VOTE FOR MIKE BRAUN  IS A VOTE
TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
>>  
>> AND YOU KNOW OUR NEW SLOGAN 
THAT WE WILL BE SWITCHING TO 
BECAUSE WE ARE WAY AHEAD OF 
SCHEDULE WITH MAKING AMERICA 
GREAT AGAIN. 
IT IS KEEP AMERICA GREAT!. KEEP 
AMERICA GREAT! 
THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. 
WE ARE SO FAR AHEAD OF 
SCHEDULE. 
PEOPLE COME UP TO ME ALL THE 
TIME AND THEY GO, THANK YOU, 
MR. PRESIDENT. 
JUST BACKSTAGE, RIGHT NOW. 
PEOPLE SAID THANK YOU, MR. 
PRESIDENT, FOR SAVING OUR 
COUNTRY. 
OUR COUNTRY WAS IN SERIOUS 
TROUBLE. 
WHEN YOU HEAR THEM TRYING TO 
TAKE CREDIT FOR WHAT WE, YOU, 
ME, WHAT ALL OF US HAVE DONE, 
IF WE DID NOT COME ALONG, YOU 
WOULD HEAD -- HAD HAVE -- HAD 
NEGATIVE NUMBERS. 
THE COUNTRY WAS CHOKING WITH 
REGULATIONS AND HIGH TAXES. 
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN IN NEGATIVE 
NUMBERS AND THAT IS WHAT WAS 
HAPPENING. 
YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN SOME REAL 
MESS. 
AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE, 
ALTOGETHER, BECAUSE THIS IS ONE 
OF THE GREAT REVOLUTIONS. 
YOU CAN CALL THE REVOLUTION IF 
YOU WOULD LIKE. 
IT IS THE GREATEST THAT HAS 
EVER TAKEN PLACE IN OUR 
COUNTRY. 
AND WE WANT TO KEEP IT GOING. 
A VOTE FOR JOE IS A VOTE FOR 
CHUCK SCHUMER, NANCY PELOSI, 
AND WHO ELSE. 
MAXINE WATERS. 
YOU KNOW, I GAVE MIKE, A LITTLE 
WHILE AGO, SOMETHING THAT I SAW.
BUT HE HAS ALREADY SEEN IT. 
THE INDIANAPOLIS STAR DID A 
STORY AND I GUESS IT IS A POLL 
OF SOME KIND. 
JOE DONNELLY RATED LEAST 
EFFECTIVE DEMOCRAT IN SENATE IN 
A NEW STUDY. 
IT SAYS, WHO IS THE LEAST 
EFFECTIVE DEMOCRAT IN THE 
UNITED STATES SENATE? SENATOR 
JOE DONNELLY, ACCORDING TO THE 
CENTER FOR EFFECTIVE LAWMAKING, 
WHO SAID THAT THE DEMOCRAT FROM 
INDIANA WAS THE WORST. 
ACCORDING TO THE CENTER, 
DONNELLY INTRODUCED TWO BILLS 
IN THE 114th CONGRESS. 
THAT WAS BETWEEN 2015 AND 2016 
THAT RECEIVE SOME SORT OF 
ACTION IN COMMITTEE. 
NEITHER OF THOSE ADVANCED TO 
THE FLOOR. 
NOW, THIS WAS NOT AN ANOMALY IT 
SAYS. 
THE CENTER JUST SAID THIS. 
THIS IS NOT JUST A ONE TIME OR 
ONE YEAR UNUSUAL THING OR 
ANOMALY. 
IT RANKED DONNELLY 55 OUT OF 57.
THAT AMONG DEMOCRATS IN THE 
113th CONGRESS. 
SO I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU THAT 
IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT 
REPRESENTING INDIANA, YOU CAN 
HAVE IT. 
>>  JOE HAS GOT TO 
GO! 
JOE HAS GOT TO GO! 
>> JOE DONNELLY VOTED NO ON TAX 
CUTS AND ON OBAMACARE. 
WE WOULD HAVE HAD OBAMACARE.IF 
HE WOULD HAVE RAISED HIS HAND. 
HE VOTED NO ON REPEAL AND 
REPLACE OF OBAMACARE. 
BUT WE DID GET RID OF THE 
INDIVIDUAL AND EIGHT AND WE 
BROUGHT IT DOWN. 
IT IS GONE AND IT IS LEAVING 
FAST. 
JOE DONNELLY VOTED AGAINST 
ENHANCED VETTING OF REFUGEES. 
LET THEM COME IN. 
OPEN UP THE BORDERS. 
OPEN THEM UP. 
HE SAYS, OPEN UP THOSE BORDERS 
AND LET THEM IN. 
HE VOTED AGAINST STOPPING 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM GETTING 
WELFARE. 
AND DONNELLY REPEATED VOTING 
FOR AMNESTY. 
HE WANTS AMNESTY. 
DONNELLY ALSO VOTED FOR LIBERAL 
OBAMA JUDGES WHO WANT TO TAKE 
AWAY YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT AND 
LOTS OF OTHER RIGHTS. 
WE NEED TO ELECT SENATORS WHO 
WILL VOTE FOR JUDGES WHO FOLLOW 
OUR LAWS AND OUR CONSTITUTION 
AS WRITTEN. 
>>  
>> LIKE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 
NEIL GORSUCH, WHO IS DOING A 
GREAT JOB. 
AND JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH. IN 
THIS ELECTION, YOU ARE NOT JUST 
VOTING FOR A CANDIDATE. 
YOU ARE VOTING FOR WHICH PARTY 
CONTROLS CONGRESS. 
IT IS VERY CLOSE. 
PEOPLE SAY WE HAVE THE MAJORITY 
-- BUT HOW MUCH -- BY HOW MUCH? 
IF SOMEBODY HAS A COLD, WE NO 
LONGER HAVE THE MAJORITY. 
WE NEED REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS.
TODAY, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, IS 
HELD HOSTAGE BY LEFT-HAND 
HATERS, DEEP STATE RADICALS, 
ESTABLISHMENT CRONIES AND THEIR 
FAKE NEWS ALLIES. 
OUR BIGGEST OBSTACLE, AND THEIR 
GREATEST ALLY, ACTUALLY IS THE 
MEDIA. 
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT. 
WE HAVE GOT STORIES THAT ARE SO 
BIG THAT THE MEDIA DOES NOT 
PICK THEM UP. 
WE HAVE STORIES THAT, IF THAT 
WAS ABOUT A REPUBLICAN OR 
CONSERVATIVE, IT WOULD BE FRONT 
PAGE OF EVERY NEWSPAPER. 
AND WE HAVE THEM AND THEY JUST 
DON'T WANT TO WRITE THEM. 
IT IS A DISHONEST GROUP OF 
PEOPLE. 
I WILL TELL YOU THAT. 
YOU CAN HAVE THE BIGGEST STORY 
ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. 
THEY CAN HAVE THAT. 
LET'S SEE IF THEY GET AWAY WITH 
IT. 
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT OUR 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, AND OUR FBI,
INSIDE, THEY HAVE INCREDIBLE 
PEOPLE. 
BUT OUR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND 
OUR FBI HAVE TO START DOING 
THEIR JOB AND DOING IT RIGHT 
AND DOING IT NOW. 
PEOPLE ARE ANGRY. 
PEOPLE ARE ANGRY. 
WHAT IS HAPPENING IS A 
DISGRACE. 
AND AT SOME POINT, I WANTED TO 
SAY THAT IF IT DOES NOT 
STRAIGHTEN OUT PROPERLY, I WANT 
THEM TO DO THEIR JOB. 
I WILL GET INVOLVED AND I WILL 
DO THAT IF I HAVE TO. 
IT IS DISGRACEFUL. 
AND THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING 
IN THE WHOLE WORLD GETS IT. 
THE DEMOCRATS CALL THEMSELVES 
THE RESISTANCE. 
THEY ARE OBSTRUCTIONISTS. 
EVERY DAY THEY ARE RESISTING 
THE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
AND TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE 
VERDICT OF OUR DEMOCRACY, 
DELIVERED SO STRONGLY IN 2016, 
LIKE NEVER BEFORE DELIVERED. 
>>  
>> THE MOST AMERICA THING ABOUT 
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS HOW 
TRULY UNDEMOCRATIC THEY REALLY 
HAVE BECOME. 
>> WE ARE GETTING RID OF THOSE 
BAD IDEAS ONE BY ONE. 
AND IT IS DRIVING THEM CRAZY. 
THEY ARE THE OLD AND CORRUPT 
GLOBAL RULING CLASS. 
THEY SQUANDERED TRILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS ON FOREIGN ADVENTURES. 
THEY DON'T WANT TO BUILD A WALL 
HERE BUT WE HAVE STARTED. 
IT IS NOT EASY. 
BUT THEY WILL BUILD WALLS IN 
OTHER COUNTRIES. 
THEY WILL CREATE BORDERS IN 
OTHER LANDS SO FAR WAY. 
BUT OVER HERE, LET EVERYBODY 
POUR IN AND WE DON'T WORRY 
ABOUT THE CRIME. 
IT IS A DISGRACE. 
THEY HAVE MADE THE WORST TRADE 
DEALS IN THE HISTORY OF THE 
WORLD. 
AND WHO WOULD MAKE THEMSELVES 
RICH WHILE PRESIDING OVER 
AMERICAN JOBS AND AMERICAN 
COUNTRIES AND AMERICAN WEALTH? 
IT WAS THE GREATEST TRANSFER OF 
WEALTH IN THE HISTORY OF THE 
WORLD. 
WHAT WE DID, WHAT WE DID TO OUR 
COMPANIES AND OUR JOBS, WE 
SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF OUR 
LEADERSHIP. 
BUT NOT THIS LEADERSHIP. 
WE ARE BRINGING THEM BACK. 
>> WHEN WE PLEDGED TO WORK ON 
CORRUPTION IN WASHINGTON, THESE 
ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT. 
SO IN THIS ELECTION, WE CANNOT 
LET UP. 
WE ARE GOING TO DRAIN THE SWAMP!
>>  WE 
HAVE REPLACED DEMOCRATIC 
LAWMAKERS WITH AMERICA FIRST 
REPUBLICANS AND IT IS 
HAPPENING. 
WE WANT PEOPLE LIKE MIKE BRAUN. 
REPUBLICANS STAND FOR STOPPING 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. 
FIXING BAD, HORRIBLE AND 
OBSOLETE TRADE DEALS. 
UNLEASHING AMERICAN ENERGY. 
CUTTING TAXES AND SUPPORTING OUR
MILITARIES AND OUR GREAT 
VETERANS. 
>>  USA! 
USA! 
USA! USA! 
>> REPUBLICANS STAND FOR 
PROTECTING SOCIAL SECURITY AND 
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND 
STRENGTHENING AND THE SAFETY 
NET FOR AMERICANS, NOT FOR 
ILLEGAL ALIENS AND PEOPLE THAT 
COME INTO OUR COUNTRY TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF US. 
DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE YOUR 
TAXES. 
AND WE WANT TO LOWER YOUR 
TAXES. 
BY THE WAY, THAT DOES NOT SOUND 
LIKE A GREAT CAMPAIGN THEME. 
WE ARE GOING TO RAISE YOUR 
TAXES. 
WE ARE GOING TO FIRE I.C.E. 
A WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. 
WE WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR 
REGULATIONS. 
THEY WANT TO INCREASE YOUR 
REGULATIONS. 
THEY WANT TO MAKE OUR MILITARY 
WEAKER. 
WE WANT MONEY FOR THE MILITARY 
AND THEY WANT MONEY FOR THINGS 
THAT YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE. 
THEY WANT TO SHUT DOWN YOUR 
COAL MINES. 
THAT IS NOT HAPPENING. 
BUT YOU ARE UP LIKE 60%. 
YOU ARE DOING ALL RIGHT. 
I HAVE HAD SUCH AN INCREDIBLE 
EXPERIENCE WITH THE MINORS. 
JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO, 
BACKSTAGE, THERE WERE NINE OF 
THEM. 
THESE ARE TOUGH GUYS. 
I LOOKED AT THEM AND SAID I DID 
NOT WANT TO FIGHT THESE GUYS. 
OF THE NINE, EIGHT OF THEM WERE 
CRYING. 
AND I LOOKED AT THE NINTH, 
CRYING OUT OF HAPPINESS BECAUSE 
THEY ARE BACK. 
I LOOKED AT THE NIGHT SKY AND 
SAID WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM. 
WHY ARE YOU NOT CRYING. 
AND HE SAID HE DOESN'T CRY. 
AND I SAID THAT'S OKAY. 
EIGHT OUT OF NINE WERE CRYING. 
WITH HAPPINESS. 
>>  
>> AND THEY WANT TO RAISE 
MEDICARE TO PAY FOR SOCIALISM. 
SOMEHOW, I DON'T SEE INDIANA 
BEING THE NEXT VENEZUELA. 
I JUST DON'T SEE IT. 
WE DON'T SEE IT. 
THAT IS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AS 
WELL. 
AT THE CENTER OF THIS ELECTION, 
IS THE ISSUE OF VOTER SECURITY. 
WE HAVE NOW STARTED THE WALL IN 
SAN DIEGO. 
AND WE ARE DOING ANOTHER 90. 
IT IS LIKE PULLING TEETH TO GET 
THE MONEY FROM DEMOCRATS. 
WE HAVE $1.6 BILLION AND THEN 
WE JUST GOT ANOTHER $1.6 
BILLION. 
NOW WE ARE ASKING FOR A LOT 
MORE. 
WE COULD DO THAT THING SO 
QUICKLY BUT THEY REALLY -- 
HONESTLY -- EVEN THOUGH, IN 
2006, ALMOST ALL OF THEM VOTED 
IN FAVOR OF THE WALL. 
NOW THEY THINK IT IS 
POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT TO DO 
ANYTHING THAT TRUMP WANTS, 
PLEASE GO AGAINST IT. 
BECAUSE, THEY ARE NOT LIKING MY 
POLL NUMBERS, EVEN A LITTLE BIT.
AND, WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY, I HAVE GOT TO SAY THIS. 
WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, 
THE HIGHEST POLL NUMBERS, I 
THINK IT IS 92%. THE HIGHEST 
POLL NUMBERS EVER IS WHAT I 
HAVE. 
ISN'T THAT CRAZY? 
I ACTUALLY ASKED THEM. 
I SAID, DID THEY DO POLLING WHEN
ABE LINCOLN WAS AROUND? 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, NOBODY HAS 
BEEN ABLE TO GIVE ME THAT 
ANSWER. 
I AM ASSUMING THEY DID. 
SO WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE 
BEATING HONEST ABE. 
DEMOCRATS WANT TO OPEN BORDERS, 
WHICH REALLY EQUALS ALLOWING 
INTO OUR COUNTRY, MASSIVE 
AMOUNTS OF CRIME. 
REPUBLICANS WANT STRONG VOTERS. 
WE WANT NO CRIME. 
WE WANT GREAT LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
AND BY THE WAY, WE LOVE OUR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
>> 
>> IF YOU WANT TO SUMMARIZE THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEMOCRATS 
AND REPUBLICANS, JUST REMEMBER 
THIS. 
DEMOCRATS WANT TO ABOLISH 
I.C.E. 
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM? 
BY THE WAY, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
, I KNOW THE PEOPLE HERE TOO 
WELL. 
I KNOW THEIR WEAKNESSES. 
BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO GO 
INTO A NEST OF MS-13. 
THEY CALL IT A NEST. 
IT IS A NEST. 
THESE ARE EVIL PEOPLE IN HERE. 
THIS IS A GROUP OF GANG MEMBERS
. I CANNOT SAY ANIMALS ANYMORE 
BECAUSE NANCY PELOSI GOT VERY 
MAD WHEN I CALLED THEM ANIMALS. 
SHE WENT CRAZY. 
>> THEY WANT TO SLICE PEOPLE 
UP. 
YOUNG GIRLS WALKING HOME FROM 
SCHOOL 16 YEARS OLD. 
AND THEY SLICED THEM UP. 
THEY DIED. 
THEY DIED. 
THEIR PARENTS ARE INCREDIBLE 
PEOPLE. 
THEY ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. 
THEY ARE DEVASTATED. 
THE REASON IS BECAUSE IT WAS 
MORE PAINFUL. 
THEN, I CALL THEM ANIMALS AND 
NANCY PELOSI GETS UPSET BECAUSE 
I'M TALKING ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS. 
THEY DON'T GET IT. 
THEY DON'T GET IT. 
SO, WE WANT TO ABOLISH MS-13, 
THEY WANT TO ABOLISH I.C.E.. 
I HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT MS-13. 
WE HAVE TOWNS IN LONG ISLAND,  
I GREW UP IN THAT AREA AND WE 
KNOW ALL OF THOSE TOWNS. 
YOU WOULD LEAVE YOUR DOOR OPEN 
YOU WOULD NEVER LET -- LOCK 
YOUR DOOR. 
NOW, THEY ARE INFESTED WITH MS-
13. 
BUT WE ARE GETTING THEM THE 
HILL OUT SO FAST.  
THEY ARE GOING. 
WE ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. 
 WE ARE DOING A 
GREAT JOB. 
AND WE HAVE NO LAWS TO WORK 
WITH. 
WE HAVE REALLY NO LAWS TO WORK 
WITH. 
THE LAWS ARE HORRIBLE. 
THEY ARE THE WORST AND DUMBEST 
IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. 
AGAIN, BETWEEN THE TRADE WORLD 
AND OUR IMMIGRATION, HORRIBLE 
LIST LAWS IN THE WORLD. 
BUT WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT. 
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT? 
I.C.E., WE CALL  I.C.E. 
AND THEY GO INTO THOSE TOWNS 
AND THEY GRAB THOSE GUYS BY THE 
NECK  AND THEY THROW THEM INTO 
THOSE PETTY WAGONS. 
THEY COULDN'T CARE LESS. 
 
>> AND YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT, 
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT, 
BUT WE HAVE SOME REALLY BAD 
PEOPLE THAT WERE ALLOWED INTO 
THIS COUNTRY UNDER PRESIDENT 
OBAMA AND OTHERS. 
AND WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT. 
AND YOU KNOW? 
THESE TOWNS THAT I KNOW SO WELL,
WE GET I.C.E. 
OUT AND THE PEOPLE ARE STANDING 
AT THEIR WINDOWS  CHEERING. 
THEY ARE CLAPPING FOR I.C.E.. 
THERE CLAPPING BECAUSE  THESE 
ARE BRAVE PEOPLE. 
THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE ALSO, BUT 
THEY ARE TOUGH. 
THEY ARE STRONG AND THEY ARE 
TOUGH AND I.C.E. 
IS AFRAID OF THEM BECAUSE  THEY 
ARE MUCH TOUGHER AND THAT IS 
WHAT HAPPENS I HATE TO SAY IT. 
SO, THEY GET OUT AND YOU KNOW 
THE SAD THING? 
IT IS SAD ACTUALLY, IT IS LIKE 
THE TOWNS ARE BEING LIBERATED 
LIKE IT IS A WAR. 
AND YOU ARE GETTING FINALLY THE 
ENEMY OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. 
THE TOWNS ARE BEING LIBERATED 
FROM THIS SCUM. 
AMAZING. 
 
>> SO, THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO 
ABOLISH I.C.E. 
AND THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO 
CHERISH I.C.E..  
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT. 
AND I THINK THAT EVERYBODY IN 
THIS ROOM RESPECTS AND REALLY 
ADMIRES BORDER PATROL, I.C.E., 
ALL OF OUR  LAW ENFORCEMENT, 
EVERYBODY. 
NOT AN EASY JOB. 
NOT AN EASY JOB. 
 
>> A VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS IN 
NOVEMBER IS ABLE TO ERASE OUR 
BORDERS AND LEAVE INNOCENT 
AMERICANS AT THE MERCY OF 
HARDENED CRIMINALS. 
THAT IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN. 
WE NEED STRONG LAW AND ORDER. 
A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A 
VOTE TO SUPPORT THE BRAVE 
HEROES OF I.C.E., BORDER 
PATROL, LAW ENFORCEMENT,  AND 
ALL OF THE OTHER GROUPS THAT 
WORK WITH US. 
 
>> EVERY DAY, I.C.E.,  WHICH 
HAS BEEN SO BADLY TREATED, THAT 
IS WHY I WILL SOMETIMES GO MORE 
AND MORE IN FAVOR OF TALKING 
ABOUT I.C.E..  
BECAUSE WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
DOING TO THE MORALE OF THESE 
BRAVE PEOPLE IS INCREDIBLE. 
IT IS INCREDIBLE. 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 
IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEM, THEY 
WOULD BE CALLING UP BEGGING, 
SAYING WHERE IS IT? 
WE NEED I.C.E.. 
WE NEED SOMEBODY TO HELP.  
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT SAFETY, 
AND THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT JOBS.
 
>> THE BEAUTY OF THE JOBS, THE 
PEOPLE THAT WERE STUCK IN ONE 
JOB AND DID NOT LIKE IT, THEY 
NOW HAVE SIX DIFFERENT 
ALTERNATIVES, THEY GET ONE THAT 
THEY LIKE AND THEY ARE MAKING 
MORE MONEY. 
WAGES ARE GOING UP, NOBODY 
THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO 
HAPPEN. 
EXCUSE ME, YOU READY? 
3.8%, ISN'T THAT NICE? 
NOBODY THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING 
TO HAPPEN. 
 
>> THANKS TO REPUBLICAN 
LEADERSHIP, OUR ECONOMY IS 
BOOMING LIKE NEVER BEFORE. 
IT HAS NEVER BEEN LIKE THIS. 
ECONOMIC GROWTH, LAST QUARTER 
HIT A NUMBER THAT NOBODY 
THOUGHT POSSIBLE. 
THIS NUMBER WAS 1, LESS THAN 1 
AND GOING DOWN TO NEGATIVE, 
NEGATIVE TERRITORY. 
WE HAVE CREATED NEARLY 4 
MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE THE 
ELECTION AND LIFTED ALMOST 4 
MILLION AMERICANS OFF OF FOOD 
STAMPS. 
 
>> WE HAVE ADDED ALMOST 500,000 
NEW MANUFACTURING JOBS SINCE 
ELECTION, 500,000. AND IF I 
WOULD HAVE COME HERE, AND I DID 
COME TO INDIANA A LOT, AND YOU 
KNOW WHO I BROUGHT WITH ME? 
DID I BRING? 
THE GREAT BOBBY KNIGHT. 
 
WHAT A COACH. 
YOU KNOW THE STORY WITH BOBBY, 
RIGHT? 
A YEAR BEFORE I WAS GOING TO RUN
BOBBY KNIGHT CALLED AND THEY 
SAID SIR, DO YOU KNOW BOBBY 
KNIGHT? 
I SAID THE COACH? 
THIS IS BEFORE I RAN. 
AND I SAID ARE YOU TALKING 
ABOUT THE COACH, MY SECRETARY, 
A GREAT PERSON SAID YES SIR, I 
THINK THEY -- HE SAID HE IS A 
COACH. 
I PICK UP AND I SAID HELLO? 
HE GOES -- TRUMP? 
THIS IS BOBBY KNIGHT AND YOU 
HAVE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND 
OUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOU. 
AND I SAID THAT IS BOBBY KNIGHT.
RIGHT? 
 
>> THAT IS BOBBY KNIGHT. 
AFTER THE FIRST WORD I KNEW IT 
WAS BOBBY KNIGHT. 
AND I SAID WELL, YOU KNOW BOBBY 
FIRST OF ALL I RESPECT YOU AND 
YOU ARE A WINNER AND THE JOB 
YOU DID YOU ARE A GREAT GUY. 
HE DOESN'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW 
THAT BUT HE HAS A BIG HEART. 
HE WOULD BE DEVASTATED IF HE 
HEARD THAT I SETTLEÃƒBUT HE 
HAS A BIG HEART. 
I SAID I HAVE NOT DECIDED TO 
RUN, BUT IF I DO I WILL CALL 
YOU. 
AN AMAZING THING HAPPENED. 
I WROTE DOWN HIS NUMBER, IT WAS 
A CELL. 
I WROTE IT DOWN AND I HAVE A 
STACK OF PAPERS ON MY DESK IN 
NEW YORK. 
I HAVE NOT BEEN THEREÃƒHAVE 
NOT BEEN TO THAT OFFICE BECAUSE 
I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THAT 
STUFF ANYMORE. 
ONLY CARE ABOUT WHAT IS GOOD 
FOR US, I COULD NOT CARE LESS 
-- THAT IS TRUE. 
 
>> THEY WILL NOT TELL YOU THAT, 
BUT IT IS TRUE. 
SO, I TAKE THIS NUMBER AND I 
PUT IT ON MY DESK AND I PUT IT 
IN THE MIDDLE OF A STACK OF 
PAPERS IT IS SORT OF A FILE OF 
THINGS THAT YOU MAY NEED 
SOMEDAY, BUT PROBABLY NOT. 
AND THEN WHEN YOU GO THROUGH 
THEM ABOUT THREE YEARS LATER 
ABOUT 95% OF IT YOU THROW OUT. 
RIGHT MARK BUT I HAD TO BIG ÃºST 
YOU WILL SEE PICTURES OF ME IN 
THE OFFICE. 
AND NOW I SAY I'M GOING TO RUN. 
WE DID GREAT, WE WERE 
CENTERSTAGE OF EVERY SINGLE 
DEBATE, RIGHT? 
EVERY SINGLE DEBATE. 
CENTERSTAGE MEANS WE WERE NEVER 
IN SECOND PLACE AND IF WE WERE, 
THEY WOULD LET YOU KNOW ABOUT 
IT TOMORROW MORNING. 
WE WERE NEVER IN SECOND. 
I WAS CENTERSTAGE ON EVERY -- 
WELL, HOWEVER MANY DEBATES. 
ANYWAY, I'M DOING WELL, WE WON 
NEW YORK, WE WON THIS ONE, WE 
WANT ABOUT ONE WE WON NEW 
HAMPSHIRE, WHILE, NEW HAMPSHIRE 
WAS SO GREAT. 
WE WON SOUTH CAROLINA AND NORTH 
CAROLINA. 
EVERYTHING, RIGHT? 
EVEN THOUGH THEY SETTLEÃƒIN 
ALL FAIRNESS I HAVE TO SAY 
THIS. 
WE WERE SO FAR AHEAD THAT I 
THINK THAT EVEN INDIANA WAS NOT 
GOING TO HAVE TOO MUCH -- BUT, 
I WANTED TO WIN INDIANA. 
A FRIEND OF MINE, HE IS FROM 
INDIANA. 
A GREAT GUY. 
I SAID HOW MY DOING IN INDIANA? 
HE SAID GREAT. 
I SAID GOOD. 
HE SAID WHAT CAN I DO TO ENSURE 
-- WELL, IF YOU COULD GET LIKE 
BOBBY KNIGHT TO ENDORSE YOU 
THAT WOULD AND INDIANA. 
I SAID, YOU KNOW IT IS FUNNY 
YOU MENTIONED THAT, BUT HE 
CALLED ME A YEAR AGO WANTING ME 
TO RUN. 
HE SAID THE COUNTRY NEEDS IT 
AND I SETTLEÃƒAND PUT HIS 
NUMBER RIGHT HERE. 
I WAS AT MY DESK, I PUT HIS 
NUMBER RIGHT HERE, ANDÃƒTRUE, 
TRUE -- I BET YOU I HAVE 2000 
PAGES OF STUFF, MORE, AND I PUT 
IT RIGHT HERE. 
I LIFTED UP THE STACK LIKE -- 
IN THE MIDDLE. 
I LIFTED IT UP, AND THERE IS A 
LITTLE CARD THAT SAYS BOBBY 
KNIGHT WITH A NUMBER. 
IT WAS THE WEIRDEST -- 
  
>> WELL -- CRAZY. 
I SAID HERE IS HIS NUMBER. 
THE GUY ACTUALLY LOOKED AT ME 
AND SAID THAT IS AMAZING. 
AND I DIALED IN FRONT OF HIM. 
I DIALED THE NUMBER. 
AND BOBBY KNIGHT DID NOT EVEN 
ASK WHO WAS ON THE PHONE. 
I GUESS HE SEES NEW YORK AND HE 
SEES MAYBE TRUMP ORGANIZATION. 
HE GOES -- I HAVE BEEN WAITING 
FOR YOU TO CALL. 
RIGHT? 
AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT -- 
BOBBY KNIGHT -- WAS ANYBODY 
HERE THE NIGHT THAT I TRAVELED 
IN WITH BOBBY KNIGHT, WHEN WE 
-- 
 
>> NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
BEFORE IN MY LIFE. 
WE WALKED INTO THIS MASSIVE 
ARENA, AND I INTRODUCED BOBBY 
KNIGHT, AND I'M TELLING YOU -- 
THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA, THEY 
WENT CRAZY. 
THAT THING NEVER STOPPED. 
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. 
AND BOBBY KNIGHT, AND I CALLED 
HIM AND SAID YOU KNOW? 
I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU TODAY 
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO INDIANA. 
AND I DON'T NEED YOU TO COME 
FROM WHERE YOU ARE. I JUST 
WANTED TO SAY HELLO TO BOBBY 
KNIGHT BECAUSE HE WAS SPECIAL 
AND HE WORKED HARD ON OUR 
CAMPAIGN. 
AND HE WAS VERY HAPPY TO GET 
THAT -- 
 
>> BOBBY KNIGHT -- WE LOVE 
WINNERS. 
WE LOVE WINNERS. 
BOBBY -- JACK NICHOLAS, TIGER, 
HOW ABOUT TIGER, THE COME BACK, 
RIGHT? 
TIGER. 
 
>> DID YOU SEE THE FAKE NEWS 
TRY TO FIGURE OUT TIGER. 
THEY DID NOT DO TOO WELL. 
TIGER IS SHARP. 
WE LOVE WINNERS. 
OUR COUNTRY IS BECOMING A 
WINNER, AND OUR COUNTRY IS 
RESPECTED AGAIN. 
YOU SEE THAT. 
  
>> WE HAVE CREATED NOT MILLIONS 
OR BILLIONS, BUT TRILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS OF WEALTH IN JUST A 
SHORT TIME SINCE OUR ELECTION. 
TRILLIONS. 
 
>> WE ARE THE TALK OF THE WORLD.
EVERY FOREIGN LEADER THAT COMES 
TO SEE ME, ALMOST -- THEY WALK 
IN AND THEY START OFF -- MR. 
PRESIDENT, CONGRATULATIONS ON 
THE INCREDIBLE SUCCESS YOU ARE 
HAVING WITH YOUR ECONOMY. 
CONGRATULATIONS. 
EVERY -- 
 
>> -- ALMOST EVERYONE. 
AND, SOMETHING THAT I AM VERY 
PROUD OF. 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT 
RECENTLY ACHIEVED THE LOWEST 
RATE EVER RECORDED IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
 
>> AND WE ARE FIGHTING EVERY DAY
FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS, FOR MORE 
JOBS, FOR HIGHER WAGES, FOR 
SAFER COMMUNITIES, FOR GREAT 
ÃºS 
CHOICE. WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE -- 
WE ARE FIGHTING HARD. 
IT IS GOING TO MAKE A BIG 
IFFERENCE. 
BUT, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, THE 
LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT IN HISTORY. 
HISPANIC AMERICANS -- AND ASIAN 
AMERICANS, THE UNEMPLOYMENT HAS 
RECENTLY REACHED THE LOWEST 
RATES IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 
COUNTRY. 
  
>> AND I WOULD REMEMBER AND YOU 
REMEMBER, WHEN I USED TO GO -- 
AND I WOULD GO TO A BIG ARENA 
LIKE THIS BIGGER. 
THIS IS A PRETTY BIG ONE, I 
MUST SAY. 
OH, BY THE WAY IF THEY WRITE 
TOMORROW -- THE ENTHUSIASM IN 
THE ROOM WAS WANTING. 
YOU KNOW, THERE LIKE -- WANTING.
SEE, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND -- 
I HAVE A BETTER EDUCATION THAN 
THEY DO, FROM A MUCH BETTER 
SCHOOL. 
HE LEAD, THEY ARE THE ELITE. 
THEY ARE THE ELITE. 
I WENT TO BETTER SCHOOLS, I 
WENT TO BETTER EVERYTHING. 
AND, BY THE WAY -- BY THE WAY, 
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? 
AND I AM PRESIDENT AND THEY ARE 
NOT. 
  
>> BUT IT IS US, IT IS US. 
IT IS A MOVEMENT, IT IS A 
MOVEMENT LIKE THIS COUNTRY -- 
AND PROBABLY THE WORLD, BUT 
LIKE THIS COUNTRY HAS NEVER 
SEEN. 
THAT IS A BIG STATEMENT, BUT I 
MAKE THAT STATEMENT, I DON'T 
GET CORRECTED AND THEY WOULD 
CORRECT ME INTO SECONDS. 
THIS IS A MOVEMENT LIKE THIS 
COUNTRY HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. 
I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. 
IF CRICKET HILLARY CLINTON HAD 
ONE -- 
  
>> AND SHE CAME TO INDIANA TO 
HAVE A RALLY FOR THE OPPONENT 
WHO WAS RATED THE WORST IN THE 
SENATE. MIKE BRAUN. 
IF YOU HAD 500 PEOPLE, 
SERIOUSLY -- IF YOU HAD -- A 
WILL NOT TELL YOU THIS, BUT WE 
DO NOT HAVE -- WE HAVE AN 
ELECTION COMING UP, WE DO NOT 
HAVE A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
COMING UP, YOU DO NOT GET BIG 
CROWDS -- IF CRICKET HILLARY 
CAME HERE AND SHE HAD 300-500Ãƒ
FIRST OF ALL, SHE WOULD NOT BE 
IN THIS BUILDING, SHE WOULD BE 
IN A HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM. 
IT WOULD BE A CONFERENCE -- 
  
>> IT WOULD BE A CONFERENCE 
ROOM. 
I'M NOT SAYINGÃƒI'M JUST 
SAYING -- I'M JUST SAYING 
SOMETHING INCREDIBLE IS 
HAPPENING WITH OUR COUNTRY 
HAPPENING TO HAVE THIS. 
SOMETHING INCREDIBLE. 
YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS JUST 
REACHING ITS LOWEST RATE IN 
NEARLY 50 YEARS THAT IS A 
BIGGIE. 
UNEMPLOYMENT, THIS IS SO 
IMPORTANT, AND EMPLOYMENT FOR 
AMERICANS WITHOUT HIGH SCHOOL 
DIPLOMAS HAS REACHED THE LOWEST 
RATE EVER RECORDED. 
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL? 
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL? 
AND PRISONERS ALL RIGHT? 
PRISONERS WERE HAVING A 
TREMENDOUSLY TOUGH TIME FROM 
THE BEGINNING. 
BECAUSE EMPLOYERS DID NOT WANT 
TO HIRE THEM. 
AND NOW, THE GREATEST THING 
THAT WE HAVE IS AN INCREDIBLE 
ECONOMY. 
WHERE EMPLOYERS NEED PEOPLE. 
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER 
REALLY. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT PROGRAMS 
TO HELP. 
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER 
EMPLOYERS ARE HIRING PRISONERS. 
THEY ARE GETTING A SECOND AND 
IN SOME CHANCES A THIRD CHANCE. 
 
>> AND I HAVE A FRIEND WHO 
HIRED PRISONERS. I SAID THAT IS 
GREAT. 
AND HE SAID, YOU WOULDN'T 
BELIEVE HOW GREAT THEY ARE. 
THEY ARE BETTER THAN MY OTHER 
PEOPLE. 
NOW, HE HAS A COUPLE OF CASES 
WHERE HE IS NOT SO HAPPY, AND 
THAT IS THE END OF THAT, THAT 
IS FINE. 
BUT, HE SAID THESE ARE 
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. 
AND, I GUARANTEE YOU I WILL HAVE
THEM IN HERE FOR 25-30 YEARS. 
THEY ARE GETTING A SECOND 
CHANCE AND IN A COUPLE OF CASES 
IT WAS A THIRD CHANCE. 
 
>> BUT, IT IS UNFAIR. 
THEY GET OUT OF PRISON, THEY 
MADE A MISTAKE. 
THEY GOT OUT OF PRISON, AND 
NOBODY HIRES THEM. 
AND THEN OF GOING BACK. 
THEY HAVE -- I MEAN, THEY 
CANNOT LIVE, THEY CANNOT EAT, 
THEY CANNOT ANYTHING. 
NOW, THEY GET THAT SECOND 
CHANCE. 
WE ARE WORKING HARD ON THAT IN 
MY ADMINISTRATIO AND THAT IS 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE 
REALLY HAPPY ABOUT. 
REALLY HAPPY. 
  
>> INCREDIBLE TO WATCH. 
THEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB. 
ALL RIGHT, WOMEN -- THIS IS NOT 
GOOD. 
SO, AFRICAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN 
AMERICAN, ALL HISTORICALÃƒ
SORRY WOMEN. 
I LET YOU DOWN AGAIN. 
WOMEN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 
RECENTLY REACHED ONLY THE 
LOWEST RATE IN 65 YEARS. 
 
>> I LET YOU DOWN, I AM SORRY. 
 
>> WHAT CAN I DO? 
BUT, YOU KNOW, I PREDICT -- 65 
YEARS FOR WOMEN, MOST OF THE 
OTHERS ARE HISTORIC. 
THE WOMEN, I PROMISE YOU, I 
THINK -- I HAD BETTER SAY THAT 
I THINK WITHIN 3-4 WEEKS YOU 
WILL ALSO BE AT HISTORIC LEVELS 
I THINK. 
WE WILL SAY 65 YEARS IS NOT 
GOOD ENOUGH. 
A BIG ONE THAT JUST CAME OUT -- 
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN OUR 
COUNTRY IS AT AN 18 YEAR HIGH, 
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL? 
A BIG THING. 
AND A BRAND-NEW POLL JUST 
SHOWED THAT 85% OF BLUE-COLLAR 
WORKERS, I LOVE BLUE-COLLAR 
WORKERS. 
 
>> ACTUALLY LIKE THEM BETTER 
THAN WHITE-COLLAR WORKERS, BUT 
PROBABLY -- I WILL NOT SAY TOO 
LOUD, I LOVE OUR BLUE-COLLAR 
WORKERS. 
AND, SO DO OUR WHITE-COLLAR 
WORKERS. 
BUT, OUR BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS 
BELIEVE THEIR LIVES ARE HEADED 
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND THE 
POLL NUMBERS ARE MASSIVE. 
WE HAVE INCREASED EXPORTS OF 
CLEAN, BEAUTIFUL COAL. 
ONE OF OUR GREAT RESOURCES THAT 
THEY WANTED TO CLOSE UP BUT 
LISTEN TO THIS -- BY 60% IN 
JUST THIS LITTLE SHORT PERIOD 
OF TIME. 
60. 
 
>> AND THANKS TO OUR VERY STRONG
TRADE POLICIES, WHERE WE DON'T 
ALLOW OTHER NATIONS TO RIP US 
OFF AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US 
ANY LONGER -- AND IF THEY DO, 
WE PUT TARIFFS ON THEIR 
PRODUCTS COMING IN. 
SORRY FOLKS. 
STEEL DYNAMICS ANNOUNCED A 75 
BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN 
COLUMBIA CITY AND A $400 
MILLION INVESTMENT IN TERRE 
HAUTE. 
 
>> AND US STEEL ANNOUNCED A 
$750 MILLION INVESTMENT IN 
GARY, INDIANA. 
 
>> AND US STEEL IS OPENING UP 
AT LEAST SEVEN PLANTS, AND THEY 
ARE GOING TO BE SPENDING 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BUILDING 
THIS. 
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT -- STEEL, 
WE WERE DEAD. 
IT WAS OVER. 
NOW, WE ARE GOING TO BE USING 
OUR MINDS. 
WE ARE OPENING UP -- IT IS LIKE 
IT IS THE HOTTEST THING THAT IS 
HAPPENING. 
OUR STEEL INDUSTRY, BECAUSE WE  
AND IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO DUMP, 
LIKE IF CHINA IS GOING TO DUMP, 
OR OTHER COUNTRIES ARE GOING TO 
DUMP STEEL TO HURT OUR 
COMPANIES, AND OUR WORKERS, 
THEY ARE PAYING 25% TARIFFS ON 
THE STUFF THAT THEY DON'T. 
NOW, THEY WILL NOT DUMP SO 
MUCH. 
WE ARE BUILDING A NEW STEEL 
INDUSTRY. 
AND IT IS AN AMAZING THING TO 
WATCH. 
BECAUSE AMERICA IS WINNING 
AGAIN. 
AND AMERICA IS BEING RESPECTED 
AGAIN. 
  
>> I AM PROUD TO SAY, THAT I 
WAS ASKED TO HELP, BECAUSE THEY 
WERE NOT GETTING ANY HELP. 
IT WAS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH 
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. 
AND WE ARE BRINGING BACK THE 
SUMMER OLYMPICS IN 2028, AND WE 
ARE BRINGING THE WORLD CUP IN 
2026 BACK TO OUR NATION. 
 
>> THOSE ARE JUST THE LITTLE 
THINGS. 
BY THE WAY -- THE OLYMPICS AND 
WORLD CUP, I MEAN -- THE BIG 
STUFF, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS. 
WE PASSED THE BIGGEST PACKAGE 
OF TAX CUTS AND REFORMS IN 
AMERICAN HISTORY. 
INDIANA FAMILIES ARE SAVING $5 
BILLION ON THEIR TAXES THIS 
YEAR ALONE. 
5 BILLION. 
 
>> IN ITALY PEOPLE, THE TYPICAL 
AMERICAN FAMILY OF FOUR EARNING 
75,000 WILL TAKE HIM $2000 AT 
LEAST EXTRA THIS YEAR AND MANY 
WILL TAKE HIM, REALLY, MUCH MORE
THAN THAT. 
THAT IS A LOT. 
 
>> AND ONE THAT PEOPLE LOVE 
BECAUSE THEY SAID IT WOULD BE 
IMPOSSIBLE TO DO -- OUR TAX BILL
SAVES SMALL BUSINESSES AND 
FAMILY FARMS, RANCHES, AND ALL 
OF THE OTHER THINGS ASSOCIATED 
WITH -- IF YOU DIE, YOU PAY A 
BIG TAX AND YOUR CHILDREN LOSE 
IT. 
WE HAVE GOTTEN RID OF THE 
ESTATE TAX, ALSO KNOWN AS THE 
DEATH TAX. 
  
>> VERY IMPORTANT FOR THIS 
AREA. 
WE ARE CANCELING PRESIDENT 
OBAMA'S ILLEGAL ANTI-CALL, SO-
CALLED CLEAN POWER PLAN. 
YOU KNOW, THERE IS AN EXAMPLE, 
IT IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL NAME, 
CLEAN POWER, RIGHT? 
THEY WANT TO HAVE WINDMILLS ALL 
OVER THE PLACE. 
WHEN THE WIND DOES NOT BLOW, 
WHAT DO WE DO? 
WE HAVE PROBLEMS. 
WHEN THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF 
BIRDS LANE AT THE BASE OF THE 
WINDOW, WHAT DO WE DO? 
ISN'T THAT AMAZING, THE 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS -- WE LIKE 
WINDMILLS, REALLY? 
WHAT ABOUT THE THOUSANDS OF 
BIRDS THAT THEY ARE KILLING? 
TRY GOING TO THE BOTTOM OF A 
WINDMILL SOMEDAY, IT IS NOT A 
PRETTY PICTURE. 
BUT, REALLY? 
WHEN THE WIND DOESN'T BLOW YOU 
HAVE PROBLEMS. 
IF YOUR HOUSE IS STARING AT A 
WINDMILL, NOT GOOD. 
WHEN YOU HEAR THAT NOISE GOING 
ROUND AND ROUND AND YOU WERE 
LIVING WITH IT AND THEN YOU GO 
CRAZY AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS 
-- NOT GOOD. 
AND THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY 
OH, ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL? 
WE HAVE ENDED THE WAR ON CLEAN 
COAL. 
WE HAVE ALSO REPEALED  THE 
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, IT IS GONE. 
LAST MONTH, THE FDA APPROVED 
MORE AFFORDABLE GENERIC DRUGS 
THAN AT ANY TIME EVER IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR ECONOMY. 
 
>> AND THANKS TO OUR EFFORT, 
MANY DRUG COMPANIES ARE 
FREEZING OR REVERSING PLANNED 
PRICE INCREASES. 
REMEMBER TWO WEEKS AGO, PFIZER 
-- AND I TAKE MY HAT OFF TO 
THEM. 
I LIKE THEM. 
THEY INCREASED THEIR PRICES. 
SUBSTANTIALLY, OF DRUGS. 
I GOT ANGRY ABOUT IT. 
ÃºI THINK  
REALIZED WHAT GREAT POWER WE 
HAVE. 
I GOT ANGRY. 
NOVARTIS, SAME THING. 
THEY INCREASED THEIR PRICES. 
I AM DECREASING THE PRICES. 
I GOT REALLY ANGRY ABOUT IT. 
AND THEY ANNOUNCED THE 
FOLLOWING DAY THAT THEY ARE NO 
LONGER GOING TO INCREASE PRICES 
OF THEIR DRUGS, AND THOSE 
PRICES ARE GOING TO COME DOWN. 
BECAUSE WE PUT MECHANISMS AND 
WORK, LOTS OF DIFFERENT -- I 
WILL NOT BORE YOU WITH THE 
COMPLICATIONS, IT IS ACTUALLY 
-- WE HAD MIDDLEMEN THAT WERE 
SO RICH, THEY WERE MAKING A 
FORTUNE ON DRUGS, PRESCRIPTION 
DRUGS. 
WE ARE GETTING RID OF ALL OF 
THAT. 
DRUG PRICES ARE COMING DOWN. 
LIKE THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN. 
INCREASES ARE STOPPING, LIKE 
WITH PFIZER AND NOVARTIS. 
AND WE ARE STOPPING HOSPITALS 
FROM OVERCHARGING LOW INCOME 
SENIORS FOR THESE SAME 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. 
 
>> WE PASSED VETERANS CHOICE, 
OUR VETERANS ARE THE GREATEST, 
YOU KNOW WHEN I GOT INVOLVED I 
SAID THAT IS A BAD SITUATION 
GOING ON WITH THE VETS. 
THEY ARE REALLY BEING TREATED 
BADLY. 
THESE ARE REALLY OUR GREATEST 
PEOPLE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. 
 
>> AND THE VETS WOULD WAIT ON 
LINE, TO SEE A DOCTOR SIX DAYS 
-- NINE DAYS -- 21 DAYS -- 34 
DAYS. 
SOME OF THEM WOULD HAVE A MINOR 
CONDITION BY THE TIME THEY SAW 
THE DOCTOR THEY WERE TERMINALLY 
ILL. 
AND I SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO 
LET THAT HAPPEN. 
AND I CAME UP WITH AN IDEA THAT 
I THOUGHT WAS BRILLIANT. 
I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT? 
WE HAVE ALL OF THESE DOCTORS, 
SOME OF THEM REALLY GOOD, 
TALENTED DOCTORS IN THE 
NEIGHBORHOODS CLOSER THAN WHERE 
THE VETS ARE TRYING TO GET 
TAKEN CARE OF. 
WE WILL LET THE VETS GO AND SEE 
THOSE DOCTORS, AND WE ARE GOING 
TO PAY THEIR BILL, RIGHT? 
  
>> AND I SAID -- I SAID, THIS 
IS SO BRILLIANT. THEN I 
PRESENTED IT TO CONGRESS, AND 
CONGRESS WENT YES SIR, WE HAVE 
BEEN TRYING TO PASS THIS FOR 45 
YEARS. 
SO -- IT IS COMMON SENSE, 
WOULDN'T YOU THINK? 
THE PROBLEM IS THEY COULD NOT 
GET IT PASSED. 
WE GOT IT PASSED. 
IT IS CALLED VETERANS CHOICE. 
THE VETERANS HAVE A CHOICE. 
THEY CAN GO HERE OR THEY CAN GO 
OUT TO SEE A DOCTOR. 
WE PAY THE BILL. 
 
>> WE ALSO PASSED A LANDMARK -- 
THIS WAS JUST AS TOUGH, BELIEVE 
IT OR NOT. 
VA ACCOUNTABILITY LAW. 
WHERE PEOPLE THAT WORK AT THE 
VA ARE NOW HELD ACCOUNTABLE. 
SO, NOW IF A GOVERNMENT WORKER 
ABUSES ONE OF OUR GREAT VETERANS
WE TURN TO THEM AND WE VERY 
TOUGH LYCC -- SORRY, YOU ARE 
FIRED. 
-- WE VERY TOUGH LEE SAY -- 
SORRY, YOU ARE FIRED. 
 
>> -- TRUE. 
VERY TOUGH THINGS TO GET PAST. 
I GUESS THAT I'M GOOD AT 
GETTING THINGS PASSED. 
BUT, WE HAD GREAT HELP BY THE 
REPUBLICANS, BY THE REPUBLICANS 
IN CONGRESS. 
WE HAD VIRTUALLY NO HELP BY THE 
DEMOCRATS. 
VERY IMPORTANTLY, MY 
ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO STANDING 
UP FOR THE FREE SPEECH RIGHTS 
OF ALL AMERICANS -- FREE SPEECH 
RIGHTS. 
LOOK AT SOCIAL MEDIA -- IT IS A 
THING CALLED FREE SPEECH 
RIGHTS. 
LOOK AT GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, 
TWITTER -- AND OTHER SOCIAL 
MEDIA GIANTS, AND I MADE IT 
CLEAR THAT WE AS A COUNTRY 
CANNOT TOLERATE POLITICAL 
CENSORSHIP, LIKE LISTING AND 
RAID SEARCH RESULTS. 
YOU KNOW, IT CAN GO THE OTHER 
WAY ALSO. 
WE WILL NOT LET LARGE 
CORPORATIONS SILENCE 
CONSERVATIVE VOICES, AND IT 
CAN. 
IT CAN GO THE OTHER WAY TO 
SOMEDAY. 
IT CAN PLAY LITTLE TRICKS WITH 
THEM. 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THEM 
CONTROL WHAT WE CAN AND CANNOT 
SEE, READ, AND LEARN FROM. 
WE CANNOT DO THAT. 
AMERICA IS A FREE COUNTRY AND 
WE ARE GOING TO STAY ALWAYS A 
FREE COUNTRY. 
 
>> WE ARE DEFENDING AMERICAN 
VALUES AND OUR GREAT AMERICAN 
INTERESTS ALL OVER THE WORLD. 
WE HAVE SECURED A RECORD $700 
BILLION FOR OUR MILITARY THIS 
YEAR AND 716 BILLION DOLLARS, 
ANOTHER RECORD NEXT YEAR. 
WE ARE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY, 
BIGGER AND BETTER AND STRONGER 
THAN EVER -- 
 
>> AND AT MY DIRECTION, THE 
PENTAGON HAS WORKED TO CREATE A 
SIXTH BRANCH OF THE UNITED 
STATES ARMED FORCES, IT IS 
CALLED SPACE FORCE. 
SO IMPORTANT. 
  
>> I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES 
FROM THE HORRIBLE IRAN NUCLEAR 
DEAL. 
AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING TO IRAN, THEY ARE NOT 
TOO HAPPY. 
YOU KNOW, WHEN I CAME INTO 
OFFICE, THEY WERE A BIG POWER, 
A BIG POWER. 
AND IT WAS A QUESTION OF -- 
WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO TAKE 
OVER THE WHOLE MIDDLE EAST? 
THEY'RE GOING INTO IRAQ, SYRIA, 
YEMEN. 
THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE 
MEDITERRANEAN FAR AWAY. 
THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE IT ALL 
OVER. 
AND I SAID -- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M 
GOING TO DO? 
I'M GOING TO TERMINATE THIS 
STUPID DEAL MADE BY THE 
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. 
 
>> AND I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING,
IRAN IS NOT LOOKING AT THE 
MEDITERRANEAN ANY LONGER. 
>> HOPEFULLY THAT WILL ALL WORK 
OUT BETWEEN US AND IRAN. 
BUT THEY HAVE TO LIVE BY A 
CERTAIN SET OF RULES. 
THAT WAS A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE 
DEAL. 
REMEMBER THEY WERE GIVEN $150 
BILLION, AND THEN THEY WERE 
GIVEN $1.8 BILLION, WHAT DOES 
THAT LOOK LIKE IN CASH? 
$1.8 BILLION. 
HARD TO BELIEVE. 
YOU REMEMBER THAT? 
I ALSO RECOGNIZE THE CAPITAL OF 
ISRAEL AND OPEN THE AMERICAN 
EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. 
 
>> BECAUSE INSTEAD OF 
APOLOGIZING FOR AMERICA, WE ARE 
STANDING TALL FOR AMERICA, THE 
COUNTRY THAT WE LOVE. 
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE 
HEROES WHO PROTECT AMERICA, WE 
ARE PROUDLY STANDING UP FOR OUR 
NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
  
>> BUT IF DEMOCRATS GET BACK 
INTO POWER, THEY WILL TRY TO 
REVERSE ALL OF THE INCREDIBLE 
GAINS THAT WE HAVE MADE, 
INCLUDING VERY SUBSTANTIALLY 
INCREASING YOUR TAXES. 
  
>> IF YOU WANT MORE JOBS, 
SAFETY AND OPPORTUNITY, THEN 
YOU NEED TO GET YOUR FRIENDS, 
GET YOUR FAMILY, GET YOUR 
COWORKERS AND GET OUT AND VOTE 
REPUBLICAN, AND VOTE OVER HERE 
FOR A GREAT GENTLEMAN NAMED 
MIKE BRAUN. 
 
>> YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR MIKE 
BRAUN. 
LOCAL CITIZENS. 
YOU LOVE YOUR STATE, YOU LOVE 
YOUR COUNTRY, YOU ARE LOYAL, 
YOU HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY. 
TOGETHER, WE ARE TAKING BACK 
OUR COUNTRY, RETURNING POWER TO 
WHERE IT BELONGS. 
WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE, THAT IS WHAT 
WE ARE DOING. 
 
>> FROM BLOOMINGTON TO MADISON 
AND FROM SOUTH BEND TO RIGHT 
HERE IN BEAUTIFUL EVANSVILLE. 
THIS GREAT STATE WAS BUILT BY 
PATRIOTS AND PIONEERS, 
MECHANICS AND MINISTERS AND 
FARMERS AND FACTORY WORKERS. 
WITH AMERICAN HANDS AND 
AMERICAN GRIT, YOUR ANCESTORS 
BUILT A HOME FOR THEMSELVES AND 
FOR THEIR BEAUTIFUL FAMILIES. 
THEY WERE TOUGH, AND THEY WERE 
STRONG, AND THEY WERE SMART. 
THEY WERE PROUD AMERICANS, AND 
TOGETHER THEY TURNED INDIANA 
INTO A POWERHOUSE OF AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
AND AMERICAN INGENUITY. 
 
>> WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THIS 
GREAT PLACE -- THEY DID NOT 
HAVE A LOT OF MONEY OR LUXURY. 
THEY LOVED THEIR FAMILIES, THEY 
LOVED THEIR COUNTRY, AND THEY 
LOVED THEIR GOD. 
 
>> WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF 
GENERATIONS OF AMERICAN 
PATRIOTS WHO KNEW HOW TO WORK, 
KNE HOW TO FIGHT, -- THEY KNEW 
HOW TO FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT. 
AND YOU KNEW HOW TO WIN, JUST 
LIKE THEM WE ARE GOING TO KEEP 
ON FIGHTING, WE ARE GOING TO 
KEEP ON WINNING, WE ARE GOING 
TO KEEP ON WINNING FOR OUR 
NATION, OUR CHILDREN, OUR 
FAMILIES, FOR OUR FREEDOM. 
  
>> WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP, WE 
WILL NEVER GIVE IN. 
WE WILL NEVER BACK DOWN. 
AND WE WILL FIGHT ON TO 
VICTORY, WE WILL ONLY HAVE 
VICTORY, BECAUSE WE ARE 
AMERICANS, AND OUR HEARTS BLEED 
RED, WHITE, AND BLUE.

>>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AT A RALLY IN 
INDIANA WHERE HE WAS 
CAMPAIGNING FOR REPUBLICAN, 
MIKE BRAUN WHO WAS RUNNING 
AGAINST DONNELLY AND THE SENATE 
RACE. 
WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT AT THE 
VERY END OF HIS REMARKS MENTION 
MIKE BRONSON NAMES -- NAME, BUT 
A LOT OF THE SPEECH, AS HAS 
HAPPENED AT OTHER RALLIES, WAS 
FOCUSED ON THE PRESIDENT 
HIMSELF AND HIS OWN 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS HE VIEWS 
THEM. 
LET'S TURN TO ANDY DOWNS RIGHT 
NOW, DIRECTOR OF THE MIKE DOWNS 
CENTER FOR POLITICS AT PURDUE 
UNIVERSITY, FORT WAYNE. 
HE IS JOINING ME DOWN. 
-- NOW. 
GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT EXACTLY 
THE PRESIDENT WAS THERE TO DO 
IN THE STATE OF INDIANA THERE IS
A RACE BETWEEN MIKE BRAUN AND 
JOE DONNELLY THERE, A DEMOCRAT 
THAT IS SEEN AS VULNERABLE IN 
THAT RED STATE. 
TELL US ABOUT THAT. 
>> THIS IS A STATE THAT QUITE 
FRANKLY A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT 
DONNELLY GOT VERY LUCKY WHEN HE 
WON THE SEAT SIX YEARS AGO. 
SOMEBODY MANAGED TO KNOCK OFF
