00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,440
Most people who visit LA come to see something like this,

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,060
But I come to see stuff like this.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,600
This Grimey part of LA is Hawthorne California

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,460
It's not a lot to look at but it is where all the aerospace companies are located

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,260
The old ones, the new ones like spaceX

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,060
and then even newer companies like the one we are gonna visit today

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,220
that are trying to build rockets faster and cheaper than ever before

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,060
Relativity and its two founders - Tim and Jordan - have a plan to make rockets faster and cheaper than anyone else.

9
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,320
To do this, they're looking to build every part of a rocket.

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,060
its engine, its fuel tanks and its body - with giant 3D printers.

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:00,000
Relativity’s building the first autonomous rocket factory in launch service.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,040
The basic problem that these guys are trying to solve is that rockets remain very expensive and hard to make.

13
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:13,460
SpaceX is the cheapest, most nimble rocket company around, and it charges about $60 million per launch

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,420
So raw materials and propellant are 5% or less of the cost. 80 or 90% are labor

15
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,140
and then the rest are kind of operational fees and things on the launch side.

16
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,480
And so it’s really how do you take that raw material, make a rocket that’s actually going to work,

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,760
and then fly it in the most efficient way.

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,360
We believe autonomous manufacturing, which is how we think of 3d printing,

19
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,780
really gets us to that point where we save a lot of money.

20
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,120
At this point, you may be thinking, dear god, not another 3D printing thing.

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,420
But here's the deal.

22
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,880
Relativity wants to sell it's rockets for 10 million dollars each

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,020
Hitting that low low everyday price, can only happen if machines replace humans on factory floor

24
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,060
and to put a novel twist on it's 3d printers,

25
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,120
Relativity's making it's own metal, with this guy's help

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,760
So I’m Sam Thomaslan, I’m the lead materials engineer at relativity,

27
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,020
I’ve been in charge of sourcing alloys, designing alloys, and tailoring all the processes

28
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,540
to get the best material properties out of all the parts that we’re printing.

29
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,660
We are looking at the structure of the materials on a micron level,

30
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,600
and so we wanna see ductility, strength, formability, all that stuff.

31
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,660
It's insane to try and build a rocket.

32
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,360
It's even more insane to have to build the world's largest 3D printer along the way.

33
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,140
But there's some reason to think that these two guys in their 20s have a chance at succeeding.

34
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:54,040
The founders both built rockets at USC. After school, Tim took a job at Jeff Bezos's rocket company

35
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,020
Blue Origin

36
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,380
where he specialized in 3D printing rocket parts.

37
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,700
Jordan ended up at SpaceX, working on engines.

38
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:07,200
Relativity has only been in business for a couple of years and hopes to fly it's first rocket in 2021.

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,400
They've raised about $10 million in funding and count Mark Cuban as their lead investor.

40
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,240
Tell me how you first made your pitch to Mark Cuban, what was the subject line of your email.

41
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,540
The subject line was “3d printing an entire rocket, space is sexy”

42
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,220
and he bit

43
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,780
and he bit, within 5 minutes like, his email game is crazy

44
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,900
With a bit of luck. Okay, with a few thousand metric tons of luck,

45
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,920
these guys hope not just to make rockets but to alter the course of how

46
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,500
and where humans make all kinds of stuff.

47
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,560
So we think a fully automated 3d printed factory with intelligent manufacturing with a small footprint

48
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,960
is what we need when we’re going out to mars and colonizing outside of space.

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,980
So relativity’s long term mission is we wanna 3d print the first rocket on mars

50
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,800
this is like a stepping stone towards a future on mars?

51
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,140
To get to this million people living and working on mars,

52
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,580
you’re going to need industrial technology to compliment that.

53
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,660
Being able to send these machines and 3d printers will really leverage and augment what their able to set up

54
00:04:11,660 --> 00:00:00,000
early on.
