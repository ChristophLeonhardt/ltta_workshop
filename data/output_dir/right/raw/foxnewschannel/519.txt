I AM TERRIFIED.

00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:04,078
IMPORTANCE OF IT YOU ARE HEARING

00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:07,248
THAT THIS HAS HAD ON MY LIFE AND

39
00:01:07,248 --> 00:01:09,517
ON MY FAMILY.

40
00:01:09,517 --> 00:01:12,053
I GREW UP IN THE SUBURBS OF

41
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:13,254
WASHINGTON, D.C.

42
00:01:13,254 --> 00:01:16,157

44
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:26,000

00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:28,336
DURING MY TIME AT THE SCHOOL,

48
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:32,173
GIRLS ARE FREQUENTLY MET AND

49
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:35,076
BECAME FRIENDLY WITH ALL BOYS

50
00:01:35,076 --> 00:01:38,813
SCHOOLS, INCLUDING GEORGETOWN

51
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:39,113

52
00:01:39,113 --> 00:01:43,084
AS WELL AS COUNTRY CLUBS AND

53
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:44,852
OTHER PLACES WHERE FAMILY

54
00:01:44,852 --> 00:01:45,253
SOCIALIZED.

55
00:01:45,253 --> 00:01:47,055
THIS IS HOW I MET BRETT

56
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:50,859
KAVANAUGH, THE BOY WHO SEXUALLY

57
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:51,659
ASSAULTED ME.

58
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:52,794
DURING MY FRESHMAN AND SOPHOMORE

59
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:55,897
SCHOOL YEARS, WHEN I WAS 14-15

60
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:58,266
YEARS OLD, MY GROUP OF FRIENDS

61
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:00,668
INTERCEPTED WITH BRETT AND HIS

62
00:02:00,668 --> 00:02:02,303
FRIENDS FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF

63
00:02:02,303 --> 00:02:03,304
TIME.

64
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:06,041
I HAD BEEN FRIENDLY WITH THE

65
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,375
CLASSMATES OF BRETT FOR EVERY

66
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,077
TIME DURING MY FRESHMAN AND

67
00:02:09,077 --> 00:02:09,676
SOPHOMORE YEAR.

68
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:11,079
IT WAS THROUGH THAT CONNECTION

69
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:13,281
THAT I ATTENDED A NUMBER OF

70
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:13,982
PARTIES THAT BRETT ALSO

71
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:14,349
ATTENDED.

72
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:16,451
WE DID NOT KNOW EACH OTHER WELL,

73
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:19,421
BUT I KNEW HIM, AND HE KNEW ME.

74
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:24,659
IN THE SUMMER OF 1982, LIKE MOST

75
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:26,294
SUMMERS, I SPENT ALMOST EVERY

76
00:02:26,294 --> 00:02:28,163
DAY AT THE COLUMBIA COUNTRY CLUB

77
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:29,464
IN CHEVY CHASE MARYLAND,

78
00:02:29,464 --> 00:02:32,901
SWIMMING AND PRACTICING DIVING.

79
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:35,070
ONE EVENING THAT SUMMER, AFTER A

80
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,438
DAY OF DIVING AT THE CLUB, I

81
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:38,907
ATTENDED A SMALL GATHERING AT A

82
00:02:38,907 --> 00:02:42,444
HOUSE IN THAT AREA.

83
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:44,646
THERE WERE FOUR BOYS I REMEMBER

84
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:45,380
SPECIFICALLY BEING AT THE HOUSE.

85
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,451
BRETT KAVANAUGH, MARK JUDGE, A

86
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:54,289
BOY NAMED PJ, AND ONE OTHER BOY

87
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:56,057
WHO I CANNOT RECALL.

88
00:02:56,057 --> 00:02:59,227
I ALSO REMEMBER MY FRIEND

89
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:00,462
"LELAND, ATTENDING.

90
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:02,464
I DO NOT REMEMBER ALL OF THE

91
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:03,398
DETAILS OF HOW THAT GATHERING

92
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:05,667
CAME TOGETHER, BUT LIKE MANY

93
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,268
THAT SUMMER, IT WAS ALMOST

94
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:09,471
SURELY A SPUR OF THE MOMENT

95
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:09,871
GATHERING.

96
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:11,906
I TRULY REMEMBER I COULD BE MORE

97
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:12,907
HELPFUL WITH MORE DETAILED

98
00:03:12,907 --> 00:03:15,043
ANSWERS TO ALL OF THE QUESTIONS

99
00:03:15,043 --> 00:03:16,544
THAT HAVE AND WILL BE ASKED

100
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:18,146
ABOUT HOW I GOT TO THE PARTY AND

101
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:19,948
WHERE IT TOOK PLACE AND SO

102
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:20,248
FORTH.

103
00:03:20,248 --> 00:03:24,286
I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS,

104
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:25,253
AND I DON'T REMEMBER AS MUCH AS

105
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:26,888
I WOULD LIKE TO.

106
00:03:26,888 --> 00:03:27,656
BUT THE DETAILS ABOUT THAT NIGHT

107
00:03:27,656 --> 00:03:29,858
THAT BRING ME HERE TODAY ARE THE

108
00:03:29,858 --> 00:03:32,894
ONES I WILL NEVER FORGET.

109
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:34,763
THEY HAVE BEEN SEARED INTO MY

110
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:35,664
MEMORY AND HAVE HAUNTED ME

111
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:39,101
EPISODICALLY AS AN ADULT.

112
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,236
WHEN I GOT TO THE SMALL

113
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:43,238
GATHERING, PEOPLE WERE DRINKING

114
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:46,441
BEER AND A SMALL LIVING

115
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:47,676
ROOM/FAMILY ROOM TYPE OF AREA ON

116
00:03:47,676 --> 00:03:48,610
THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE HOUSE.

117
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,614
I DRINK ONE BEER.

118
00:03:52,614 --> 00:03:54,049
BRETT AND MARK WERE VISIBLY

119
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:54,349
DRUNK.

120
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:57,653
EARLY IN THE EVENING, I WENT UP

121
00:03:57,653 --> 00:03:59,188
A VERY NARROW SET OF STAIRS,

122
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:01,657
LEADING FROM THE LIVING ROOM TO

123
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:03,959
A SECOND FLOOR TO USE THE

124
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:04,326
RESTROOM.

125
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:06,895
WHEN I GOT TO THE TOP OF THE

126
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:08,130
STAIRS, I WAS PUSHED FROM BEHIND

127
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,466
INTO A BEDROOM ACROSS FROM THE

128
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:11,833
BATHROOM.

129
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:15,904
I COULDN'T SEE WHO PUSHED ME.

130
00:04:15,904 --> 00:04:17,105
BRETT AND MARK CAME INTO THE

131
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:17,773
BEDROOM AND LOCKED THE DOOR

132
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:20,242
BEHIND THEM.

133
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:24,613
THERE WAS MUSIC PLAYING IN THE

134
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:24,947
BEDROOM.

135
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:27,049
IT WAS TURNED UP LETTER BY

136
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:27,749
EITHER BRETT OR MARK ONCE WE

137
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:30,052
WERE IN THE ROOM.

138
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:32,154
I WAS PUSHED ONTO THE BED, AND

139
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:34,857
BRETT GOT ON TOP OF ME.

140
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,792
HE BEGAN RUNNING HIS HANDS OVER

141
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:40,863
MY BODY AND GRINDING INTO ME.

142
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,699
I YELLED, HOPING THAT SOMEONE

143
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:45,067
DOWNSTAIRS MIGHT HEAR ME, AND I

144
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,869
TRY TO GET AWAY FROM HIM, BUT

145
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:50,139
HIS WEIGHT WAS HEAVY.

146
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:51,874
BRETT GROPED ME AND TRIED TO

147
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,474
TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES.

148
00:04:52,474 --> 00:04:54,209
HE HAD A HARD TIME BECAUSE HE

149
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:57,046
WAS VERY INEBRIATED.

150
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,648
AND BECAUSE I WAS WEARING A ONE

151
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:00,816
PIECE BATHING SUIT UNDERNEATH MY

152
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:02,852
CLOTHING.

153
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:05,054
I BELIEVED HE WAS GOING TO RAPE

154
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:05,321
ME.

155
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:08,624
I TRIED TO YELL FOR HELP.

156
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:10,326
WHEN I DID, BRETT PUT HIS HAND

157
00:05:10,326 --> 00:05:12,662
OVER MY MOUTH TO STOP ME FROM

158
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:13,295
YELLING.

159
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:15,631
THIS IS WHAT TERRIFIED ME THE

160
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:16,866
MOST, AND IT'S HAD THE MOST

161
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:19,068
LASTING IMPACT ON MY LIFE.

162
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,404
IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO BREATHE,

163
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,538
AND I THOUGHT THAT BRETT WAS

164
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:26,842
ACCIDENTALLY GOING TO KILL ME.

165
00:05:26,842 --> 00:05:28,644
BOTH RHETT AND MARK WERE

166
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:30,279
DRUNKENLY LAUGHING DURING THE

167
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:30,613
ATTACK.

168
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:32,281
THEY SEEMED TO BE HAVING A VERY

169
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:35,251
GOOD TIME.

170
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:35,952
MARCUS SEEMED AMBIVALENT AT

171
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:39,455
TIMES, URGING BRETT ON.

172
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,624
AT TIMES TELLING HIM TO STOP IT.

173
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:42,825
A COUPLE OF TIMES, I MADE EYE

174
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:45,461
CONTACT WITH MARK AND THOUGHT HE

175
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:46,329
MIGHT TRY TO HELP ME.

176
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:49,265
BUT HE DID NOT.

177
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,868
DURING THIS ASSAULT, MARK CAME

178
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:54,137
OVER AND JUMPED ON THE BED TWICE

179
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:57,673
WHILE BRETT WAS ON TOP OF ME.

180
00:05:57,673 --> 00:05:59,208
AND THE LAST TIME THAT HE DID

181
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,311
THIS, WE TOPPLED OVER, AND BRETT

182
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:04,380
WAS NO LONGER ON TOP OF ME.

183
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,414
I WAS ABLE TO GET UP AND RUN OUT

184
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:09,419
OF THE ROOM DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM

185
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:09,852
THE BEDROOM.

186
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:12,455
A SMALL BATHROOM.

187
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,222
I RAN INSIDE THE BATHROOM AND

188
00:06:13,222 --> 00:06:15,658
LOCKED THE DOOR.

189
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:19,629
I WAITED UNTIL I HEARD BRETT AND

190
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,831
MARK LEAVE THE BATHROOM,

191
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:24,033
LAUGHING, AND LOUDLY WALK DOWN

192
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:24,967
THAT NARROW STAIRWAY, PIN

193
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:25,735
BOWLING OFF THE STAIRS ON THEIR

194
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:29,038
WAY DOWN.

195
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:30,840
I WAITED, AND WHEN I DID NOT

196
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,076
HEAR THEM, I LEFT THE BATHROOM,

197
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:35,645
WENT DOWN THE SAME STAIRWELL,

198
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,480
THROUGH THE LIVING ROOM, AND

199
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,648
LEFT THE HOUSE.

200
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,951
I REMEMBER BEING ON THE STREET

201
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:42,752
AND FEELING AN ENORMOUS SENSE OF

202
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:44,754
RELIEF THAT I HAD ESCAPED THE

203
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:47,724
HOUSE, AND THAT BRETT AND MARK

204
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:50,426
WERE NOT COMING OUTSIDE AFTER M

205
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:50,693
ME.

206
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:53,663
BRETT'S ASSAULT ON ME

207
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,397
DRASTICALLY ALTERED MY LIFE FOR

208
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:56,232
A VERY LONG TIME.

209
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:59,169
I WAS TOO AFRAID AND ASHAMED TO

210
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,439
TELL ANYONE THESE DETAILS.

211
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,473
I DID NOT WANT TO TELL MY

212
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:06,976
PARENTS THAT I AT AGE 15 WAS IN

213
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:10,847
A HOUSE WITHOUT ANY PARENTS

214
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,249
PRESENT, DRINKING BEER WITH

215
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:12,882
BOYS.

216
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:14,417
I CONVINCED MYSELF THAT BECAUSE

217
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:17,487
BRETT DID NOT RAPE ME, I SHOULD

218
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:18,555
JUST MOVE ON, JUST PRETEND THAT

219
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:20,890
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

220
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,794
OVER THE YEARS, I TOLD A VERY,

221
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:26,429
VERY FEW FRIENDS THAT I HAD THIS

222
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:28,565
TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE.

223
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:31,101
I TOLD MY HUSBAND BEFORE WE WERE

224
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:33,169
MARRIED THAT I HAD EXPERIENCED A

225
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:34,638
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

226
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:37,274
I HAD NEVER TOLD THE DETAILS TO

227
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:39,676
ANYONE, IS THE SPECIFIC DETAILS

228
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:41,244
ON TILL MAY 2012 DURING A

229
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:43,313
COUPLES COUNSELING SESSION.

230
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:45,482
THE REASON THIS CAME UP IN

231
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:47,851
COUNSELING IS NOT MY HUSBAND AND

232
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:51,054
I HAD COMPLETED A VERY

233
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,023
EXTENSIVE, VERY LONG REMODEL OF

234
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:55,158
OUR HOME, AND I INSISTED ON A

235
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:57,828
SECOND FRONT DOOR.

236
00:07:57,828 --> 00:07:59,429
AN IDEA THAT HE AND OTHERS

237
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:01,498
DISAGREED WITH AND COULD NOT

238
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:03,033
UNDERSTAND.

239
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:05,535
IN EXPLAINING WHY I WANTED A

240
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:07,237
SECOND FRONT DOOR, I BEGAN TO

241
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,641
DESCRIBE THE ASSAULT IN DETAIL.

242
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:11,341
I RECALL SAYING ABOUT THE BOY

243
00:08:11,341 --> 00:08:13,944
WHO ASSAULTED ME COULD SOMEDAY

244
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:16,880
BE ON THE U.S. SUPREME COURT AND

245
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,082
SPOKE A BIT ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND

246
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,952
AT AN ELITIST ALL BOYS SCHOOL IN

247
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:23,220
BETHESDA, MARYLAND.

248
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,255
MY HUSBAND RECALLS THAT I NAMED

249
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:29,026
MY ATTACKER AS BRETT KAVANAUGH.

250
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:32,029
AFTER THAT MAY 2012 THERAPY

251
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:33,230
SESSION, I DID MY BEST TO IGNORE

252
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,767
THE MEMORIES OF THE ASSAULT

253
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:37,568
BECAUSE RECOUNTING THEM CAUSED

254
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:40,236
ME TO RELIVE THE EXPERIENCE AND

255
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:45,442
CAUSE PANIC AND ANXIETY.

256
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,478
OCCASIONALLY, I WOULD DISCUSS

257
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:49,480
THE ASSAULT AND INDIVIDUAL

258
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,448
THERAPY SESSIONS, BUT TALKING

259
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,783
ABOUT IT BECAUSE MORE RELIVING

260
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,651
OF THE TRAUMA, SO I TRIED NOT TO

261
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:56,687
THINK ABOUT IT OR DISCUSS IT.

262
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:58,856
BUT OVER THE YEARS, I WENT

263
00:08:58,856 --> 00:08:59,757
THROUGH PERIODS WHERE I THOUGHT

264
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:03,460
ABOUT THE ATTACK.

265
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,461
I HAD CONFIDED IN SOME CLOSE

266
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,563
FRIENDS THAT I HAD HAD AN

267
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:10,467
EXPERIENCE WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT.

268
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,535
OCCASIONALLY, I STATED THAT MY

269
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:12,770
ASSAILANT WAS A PROMINENT LAWYER

270
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,471
OR JUDGE, BUT I DID NOT USE HIS

271
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,639
NAME.

272
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,474
I DO NOT RECALL EACH PERSON I

273
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,877
SPOKE TO ABOUT BRETT'S ASSAULT,

274
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:22,079
AND SOME OF THOSE FRIENDS HAVE

275
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:23,647
REMINDED ME OF THESE

276
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,649
CONVERSATIONS SINCE THE

277
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:26,083
PUBLICATION OF

278
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,520
"THE WASHINGTON POST" STORY ON

279
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,855
BUT UNTIL JULY 2018, I   I HAD N

280
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:28,352
BUT UNTIL JULY 2018, I   I HAD V

281
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:31,889
SEPTEMBER 16TH 2018.

282
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:32,122
BUT UNTIL JULY 2018, I   I HAD R

283
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:34,625
NAMED MR. KAVANAUGH AS MY

284
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:38,462
ATTACKER OUTSIDE OF THERAPY.

285
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:42,633
THIS CHANGED IN EARLY JULY 2018.

286
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:43,401
I SAW PRESS REPORTS STATING THAT

287
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:47,438
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS ON THE

288
00:09:47,438 --> 00:09:48,706
SHORT-LIST OF A LIST OF VERY

289
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:51,409
WELL-QUALIFIED SUPREME COURT

290
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:51,842
NOMINEES.

291
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,312
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY CIVIC DUTY

292
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:58,049
TO GIVE MY INFORMATION ABOUT THE

293
00:09:58,049 --> 00:09:59,250
CONDUCT SO THAT THOSE

294
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,017
CONSIDERING THE NOMINATION WOULD

295
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,153
KNOW ABOUT THIS ASSAULT.

296
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:05,990
ON JULY 6, THERE WAS A SENSE OF

297
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,392
URGENCY TO RELAY THE INFORMATION

298
00:10:08,392 --> 00:10:11,896
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BEFORE A

299
00:10:11,896 --> 00:10:12,463
NOMINEE WAS SELECTED.

300
00:10:12,463 --> 00:10:14,532
I DID NOT KNOW HOW SPECIFICALLY

301
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:18,436
TO DO THIS.

302
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:19,270
I CALLED MY CONGRESSIONAL

303
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,272
REPRESENTATIVE AND LET HER

304
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:23,040
RECEPTIONIST NOW THAT SOMEONE ON

305
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,741
THE PRESIDENT SHORT-LIST HAD

306
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:27,411
ATTACKED ME.

307
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:30,815
I ALSO SENT A MESSAGE TO THE

308
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:32,817
ENCRYPTED "WASHINGTON POST" TIP

309
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:34,218
LINE.

310
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:35,186
I PROVIDED THE NAMES OF BRETT

311
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:36,821
KAVANAUGH AND MARK JUDGE.

312
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:40,458
I STATED THAT MR. KAVANAUGH HAD

313
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,894
ASSAULTED ME IN THE 1980s IN

314
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:44,829
MARYLAND.

315
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:45,596
THIS WAS AN EXTREMELY HARD THING

316
00:10:45,596 --> 00:10:50,068
FOR ME TO DO, BUT I FELT THAT I

317
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:51,736
COULDN'T NOT DO IT.

318
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:54,873
OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS, I TOLD A

319
00:10:54,873 --> 00:10:56,474
COUPLE OF CLOSE FRIENDS ON THE

320
00:10:56,474 --> 00:10:59,310
BEACH IN CALIFORNIA THAT

321
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,013
MR. KAVANAUGH HAD A SEXUALLY

322
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:03,214
ASSAULTED ME.

323
00:11:03,214 --> 00:11:05,383
I WAS VERY CONFLICTED AS TO

324
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:07,852
WHETHER TO SPEAK OUT.

325
00:11:07,852 --> 00:11:09,454
ON JULY 9TH, I RECEIVED A RETURN

326
00:11:09,454 --> 00:11:13,024
PHONE CALL FROM THE OFFICE OF

327
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:13,791
THE CONGRESSWOMAN, AFTER

328
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:18,062
MR. KAVANAUGH HAD BECOME THE

329
00:11:18,062 --> 00:11:18,463
NOMINEE.

330
00:11:18,463 --> 00:11:20,031
I MET WITH HER STAFF ON

331
00:11:20,031 --> 00:11:23,301
JULY 18TH, AND WITH HER ON JULY

332
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:24,436
JULY 20TH, DESCRIBING THE

333
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:25,203
ASSAULT, AND DISCUSSING MY FEARS

334
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:28,840
ABOUT COMING FORWARD.

335
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,441
LATER, WE DISCUSSED THE

336
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:31,676
POSSIBILITY OF SENDING A LETTER

337
00:11:31,676 --> 00:11:33,178
TO RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN, WHO

338
00:11:33,178 --> 00:11:35,580
IS ONE OF MY STATE SENATORS,

339
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,317
DESCRIBING WHAT OCCURRED.

340
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:41,386
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

341
00:11:41,386 --> 00:11:43,788
REPRESENTATIVE, OR OFFICE

342
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:47,392
DELIVERED A COPY OF MY LETTER TO

343
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:47,926
FEINSTEIN'S OFFICE.

344
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:50,996
THE LETTER INCLUDED MY NAME, BUT

345
00:11:50,996 --> 00:11:54,799
ALSO REQUEST THAT IT BE KEPT

346
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,235
CONFIDENTIAL.

347
00:11:57,235 --> 00:11:59,638
MY HOPE WAS THAT PROVIDING THE

348
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:00,839
INFORMATION CONFIDENTIALLY WOULD

349
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,675
BE ENOUGH FOR THE SENATE TO

350
00:12:03,675 --> 00:12:05,076
CONSIDER THE SERIOUS MISCONDUCT

351
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:06,545
WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE MYSELF,

352
00:12:06,545 --> 00:12:10,682
MY FAMILY, OR ANY WOMAN'S FAMILY

353
00:12:10,682 --> 00:12:11,683
VULNERABLE TO THE PERSONAL

354
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:14,252
ATTACKS AND INVASIONS OF PRIVACY

355
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:15,353
THAT WE HAVE SEEN SINCE MY

356
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:17,856
INFORMATION BECAME PUBLIC.

357
00:12:17,856 --> 00:12:21,059
AND A LETTER DATED AUGUST 31ST,

358
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:22,461
SENATOR FEINSTEIN WROTE THAT SHE

359
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:24,596
WOULD NOT SHARE THE LETTER

360
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:25,363
WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT CONSENT, AND

361
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:28,834
I APPRECIATED THIS COMMITMENT.

362
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:29,868
SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS SHOULD BE

363
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:31,503
ABLE TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES

364
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:34,239
WHEN AND WHETHER THEIR PRIVATE

365
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:36,741
EXPERIENCE IS MADE PUBLIC.

366
00:12:36,741 --> 00:12:39,778
AS THE HEARING DATE GOT CLOSER,

367
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:42,647
I STRUGGLED WITH A TERRIBLE

368
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:42,981
CHOICE.

369
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:47,619
DO I SHARE THE FACTS AND IT PUTS

370
00:12:47,619 --> 00:12:49,321
MY FAMILY IN THE SPOTLIGHT?

371
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:52,023
OR DO I PRESERVE OUR PRIVACY AND

372
00:12:52,023 --> 00:12:52,891
ALLOW THE SENATE TO MAKE ITS

373
00:12:52,891 --> 00:12:56,528
DECISION WITHOUT KNOWING THE

374
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:58,197
FULL TRUTH OF HIS PAST

375
00:12:58,197 --> 00:13:00,265
BEHAVIORS?

376
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:01,900
I AGONIZED DAILY ABOUT THIS

377
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,804
DECISION THROUGHOUT AUGUST AND

378
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:07,105
SEPTEMBER 2018.

379
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:09,208
THE SENSE OF DUTY THAT

380
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,642
ORIGINALLY MOTIVATED ME TO REACH

381
00:13:10,642 --> 00:13:12,678
OUT CONFIDENTIALLY TO

382
00:13:12,678 --> 00:13:13,479
"THE WASHINGTON POST" AND IT

383
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:16,448
TO'S OFFICE, WHEN THERE WAS

384
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:23,489
STILL A LIST OF EXTREMELY

385
00:13:23,622 --> 00:13:24,723
SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS ALWAYS THE

SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS ALWAYS THA

SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS ALWAYS THS

394
00:13:25,925 --> 00:13:17,082
SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS ALWAYS THO

395
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:25,958
QUALIFIED CANDIDATES, AND

396
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:26,392
SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS ALWAYS THF

397
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:28,461
SPEAKING OUT OF STARTED TO

398
00:13:28,461 --> 00:13:30,196
EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE.

399
00:13:30,196 --> 00:13:33,699
IT DURING AUGUST 2018, THE PRESS

400
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:34,667
REPORTED THAT MR. KAVANAUGH'S

401
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:36,635
CONFIRMATION WAS VIRTUALLY

402
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:40,873
CERTAIN.

403
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:42,675
PERSONS PAINTED HIM AS A

404
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:44,677
CHAMPION OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND

405
00:13:44,677 --> 00:13:45,211
EMPOWERMENT.

406
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:48,013
AND I BELIEVED THAT IF I CAME

407
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:49,448
FORWARD, MY SINGLE VOICE WOULD

408
00:13:49,448 --> 00:13:50,649
BE DROWNED OUT BY A CHORUS OF

409
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:53,419
POWERFUL SUPPORTERS.

410
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:55,454
BY THE TIME OF THE CONFIRMATION

411
00:13:55,454 --> 00:13:56,255
HEARINGS, I HAD RESIGNED MYSELF

412
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:58,524
TO REMAIN QUIET.

413
00:13:58,524 --> 00:14:00,860
AND LETTING THE COMMITTEE AND

414
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,628
THE SENATORS MAKE THEIR DECISION

415
00:14:02,628 --> 00:14:03,195
WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT

416
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:06,232
MR. KAVANAUGH HAD DONE TO ME.

417
00:14:06,232 --> 00:14:08,601
ONCE THE PRESS STARTED REPORTING

418
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:12,705
ON THE EXISTENCE OF THE LETTER,

419
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:14,940
I FACED MOUNTING PRESSURE.

420
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,076
REPORTERS APPEARED AT MY HOME

421
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:19,812
AND AT MY WORKPLACE.

422
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:22,047
DEMANDING INFORMATION ABOUT THE

423
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:22,648
LETTER.

424
00:14:22,648 --> 00:14:25,017
IN THE PRESENCE OF MY GRADUATE

425
00:14:25,017 --> 00:14:26,786
STUDENTS.

426
00:14:26,786 --> 00:14:28,954
THEY CALLED MY BOSSES AND

427
00:14:28,954 --> 00:14:30,456
COWORKERS AND LEFT ME MANY

428
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:33,025
MESSAGES, MAKING IT CLEAR THAT

429
00:14:33,025 --> 00:14:35,228
MY NAME WOULD INEVITABLY BE

430
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:36,662
RELEASED TO THE MEDIA.

431
00:14:36,662 --> 00:14:38,965
I DECIDED TO SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY

432
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:40,066
TO A JOURNALIST WHO HAD

433
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:42,301
ORIGINALLY RESPONDED TO THE TIP

434
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:43,669
I HAD SENT TO

435
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:44,370
"THE WASHINGTON POST" AND WHO

436
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,571
HAD GAINED MY TRUST.

437
00:14:45,571 --> 00:14:48,074
IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO

438
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:48,874
DESCRIBE THE DETAILS OF THE

439
00:14:48,874 --> 00:14:53,246
ASSAULT IN MY OWN WORDS.

440
00:14:53,246 --> 00:14:55,081
SINCE THE SEPTEMBER 16TH, THE

441
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:56,983
DATES OF "THE WASHINGTON POST"

442
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:59,652
STORY, I HAVE EXPERIENCED AN

443
00:14:59,652 --> 00:15:00,420
OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT FROM

444
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,423
PEOPLE IN EVERY STATE OF THIS

445
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,756
COUNTRY.

446
00:15:03,756 --> 00:15:05,658
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF

447
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:07,360
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR LIVES

448
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,162
DRAMATICALLY ALTERED BY

449
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:12,065
SEXUAL VIOLENCE HAVE REACHED OUT

450
00:15:12,065 --> 00:15:13,066
TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCE AND

451
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:14,500
HAVE THANKED ME FOR COMING

452
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:14,834
FORWARD.

453
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:18,838
WE HAVE RECEIVED TREMENDOUS

454
00:15:18,838 --> 00:15:19,639
SUPPORT FROM FRIENDS AND

455
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,206
COMMUNITY.

456
00:15:20,206 --> 00:15:22,542
AT THE SAME TIME, MY GREATEST

457
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:24,277
FEARS HAVE BEEN REALIZED, AND

458
00:15:24,277 --> 00:15:25,578
THE REALITY HAS BEEN FAR WORSE

459
00:15:25,578 --> 00:15:28,247
THAN WHAT I EXPECTED.

460
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:30,850
MY FAMILY AND I HAVE BEEN THE

461
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,285
TARGET OF CONSTANT HARASSMENT

462
00:15:32,285 --> 00:15:33,920
AND OF DEATH THREATS, AND I HAVE

463
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,455
BEEN CALLED THE MOST VILE AND

464
00:15:35,455 --> 00:15:38,825
HATEFUL NAMES IMAGINABLE.

465
00:15:38,825 --> 00:15:40,827
THESE MESSAGES, WHILE FAR FEWER

466
00:15:40,827 --> 00:15:41,694
THAN THE EXPRESSIONS OF SUPPORT,

467
00:15:41,694 --> 00:15:44,430
HAVE BEEN TERRIFYING AND HAVE

468
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,000
ROCKED ME TO MY CORE.

469
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,268
PEOPLE HAVE POSTED MY PERSONAL

470
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:51,037
INFORMATION AND THAT OF MY

471
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:53,440
PARENTS ONLINE ON THE INTERNET.

472
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,608
THIS HAS RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL

473
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:57,677
EMAILS, CALLS, AND THREATS.

474
00:15:57,677 --> 00:16:00,280
MY FAMILY AND I WERE FORCED TO

475
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,614
MOVE OUT OF OUR HOME.

476
00:16:01,614 --> 00:16:02,882
SINCE IT SEPTEMBER 16TH, MY

477
00:16:02,882 --> 00:16:05,218
FAMILY AND I HAVE BEEN VISITING

478
00:16:05,218 --> 00:16:08,655
ANNA VARIOUS SECURE LOCATIONS,

479
00:16:08,655 --> 00:16:10,624
AT TIMES SEPARATED, AND AT TIMES

480
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:11,992
TOGETHER, WITH THE HELP OF

481
00:16:11,992 --> 00:16:13,226
SECURITY GUARDS.

482
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:15,228
THIS PAST TUESDAY EVENING, MY

483
00:16:15,228 --> 00:16:17,597
WORK EMAIL WAS HACKED, AND

484
00:16:17,597 --> 00:16:19,799
MESSAGES WERE SENT OUT, TRYING

485
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:22,669
TO RECANTS MY DESCRIPTION OF THE

486
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:24,638
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

487
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:27,007
APART FROM THE ASSAULT ITSELF,

488
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:28,108
THESE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS HAVE

489
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:30,210
BEEN THE HARDEST OF MY LIFE.

490
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,578
I HAVE HAD TO RELIVE THIS TRAUMA

491
00:16:31,578 --> 00:16:34,014
IN FRONT OF THE WORLD.

492
00:16:34,014 --> 00:16:36,483
AND I HAVE SEEN IN MY LIFE

493
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:37,150
PICKED APART BY PEOPLE ON

494
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:41,388
TELEVISION, ON TWITTER, OTHER

495
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:41,822
SOCIAL MEDIA.

496
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:44,925
OTHER MEDIA, WHO HAVE NEVER MET

497
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:48,395
ME OR SPOKEN WITH ME.

498
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:50,297
I HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF ACTING

499
00:16:50,297 --> 00:16:52,199
OUT OF PARTISAN POLITICAL

500
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:52,533
MOTIVES.

501
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:53,200
OF THOSE WHO SAY THAT DO NOT

502
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,836
KNOW ME.

503
00:16:55,836 --> 00:16:59,506
I AM AN INDEPENDENT PERSON, AND

504
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:00,774
MY MOTIVATION AND COMING FORWARD

505
00:17:00,774 --> 00:17:04,912
WAS TO BE HELPFUL AND TO PROVIDE

506
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:08,248
FACTS ABOUT HOW MR. KAVANAUGH'S

507
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:09,650
ACTIONS HAVE IMPACTED MY LIFE SO

508
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,252
THAT YOU COULD TAKE INTO SERIOUS

509
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:14,021
CONSIDERATION, AS YOU MAKE YOUR

510
00:17:14,021 --> 00:17:16,256
DECISION ABOUT HOW TO PROCEED.

511
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:18,825
IT IS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY TO

512
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:19,792
DETERMINE WHETHER MR. KAVANAUGH

513
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,595
DESERVES TO SIT ON THE

514
00:17:21,595 --> 00:17:23,063
SUPREME COURT.

515
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:23,830
MY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO TELL YOU

516
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,866
THE TRUTH.

517
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:30,604
I UNDERSTAND THAT A PROFESSIONAL

518
00:17:30,604 --> 00:17:32,239
PROSECUTOR HAS BEEN HIRED AT TO

519
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:33,907
ASK ME QUESTIONS, AND I AM

520
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:35,542
COMMITTED TO DOING MY VERY BEST

521
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:36,643
TO ANSWER THEM.

522
00:17:36,643 --> 00:17:38,278
I HAVE NEVER BEEN QUESTIONED BY

523
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:40,414
A PROSECUTOR, AND I WILL DO MY

524
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:40,981
BEST.

525
00:17:40,981 --> 00:17:42,449
AT THE SAME TIME, BECAUSE THE

526
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:44,451
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL BE

527
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:45,486
JUDGING MY CREDIBILITY, I DO

528
00:17:45,486 --> 00:17:46,753
HOPE TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE

529
00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:49,490
DIRECTLY WITH EACH OF YOU, AND

530
00:17:49,490 --> 00:00:00,000
AT THIS POINT, I WILL DO MY BEST
