>>DONALD TRUMP WANTS A VARIETY
OF MILITARY OPTIONS FOR NORTH
KOREA, IT'S NOT BEING TALKED
ABOUT MUCH BUT HE HAS ASKED THE
PENTAGON TO SUPPLY THOSE
OPTIONS, AND NOW A LEAK OUT OF
THE PENTAGON HAS SAID THEY DON'T
WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE
AFRAID THAT IF THEY PROVIDE
OPTIONS HE IS GOING TO CHOOSE
ONE, AND THAT IS CAUSING A COLD
SWEAT TO ROLL DOWN THE NECK OF
SOME OF OUR MOST EXPERIENCED
GENERALS.
AND THERE'S A REASON
FOR THIS, BECAUSE THERE IS SORT
OF A RIFT BETWEEN DIFFERENT
PORTIONS OF THE WHITE HOUSE ON
WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT
NORTH KOREA --
>>WHICH SOUNDS TO ME LIKE ALL
OUT WAR, BUT THEY ARE PITCHING
IT AS JUST GETTING RID OF THE
ARSENAL.
NOW --
>>AND IF YOU FOLLOW HIS TWITTER
THAT'S A CONCERN, THAT HE MIGHT
DO SOMETHING WHEN IT COMES TO
NORTH KOREA.
SO MCMASTER
REPRESENTS THE HAWKISH PART OF
THE WHITE HOUSE, SUPPOSEDLY
THERE IS A PART THAT ONCE MORE
CAUTION WHEN IT COMES TO
NORTH KOREA --
>>WHICH SOUNDS GOOD, BUT THEN
YOU FIND OUT THAT --
>>YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE
COOLER HEADS, BUT YOU ARE THE
ONES CALLING FOR THE STRIKE.
WHO
DO YOU THINK, JARED IS GOING TO
STAND AGAINST IT.
ASK BARRON.
>>THERE IS SO MUCH REVERSE
PSYCHOLOGY.
WE NEED TO LAY OUT
HOW WE WANT THE BABY TO PLAY
WITH SOMETHING BUT NOT MY KEYS
OR MY CELL PHONE, SO JUST PUT
OTHER THINGS IN HERE.
DO WE GIVE
THE BABY THREE OPTIONS OR FIVE
OPTIONS, OR JUST THE TOY?
IT'S VERY UNCLEAR.
>>THERE IS A LOT OF THIS IN THE
CHAIN OF GOVERNMENT, WHERE THEY
KICK IT UP AND THEY THINK
SO-AND-SO -- THERE'S A FAMOUS
CASE IN THE ARMY WHERE THERE WAS
A DESERTER WHO WAS EXECUTED AND
THE JUDGE WHO PRESIDED OVER HIS
FIRST COURT-MARTIAL/EXECUTION
TRIAL SAID I VOTED FOR EXECUTION
BUT I THOUGHT WHEN HE APPEALED
IT WOULD BE OVERTURNED, I DIDN'T
THINK THEY WOULD ACTUALLY
EXECUTE HIM. AND THEY SHOT HIM,
FIRING SQUAD.
SAME THING HERE,
YOU ARE THE COOLER HEADS, AND
THERE IS NO LIMITED NUCLEAR OR
OTHER EVEN CONVENTIONAL MILITARY
STRIKE ON NORTH KOREA, CAN'T BE
DONE.
IT WILL IMMEDIATELY BRING
ABOUT REPRISALS, AND A
CONFLAGRATION OF THE SORT THAT I
THINK COULD KILL MILLIONS.
IT'S
EXTRAORDINARY TO ME, IT'S A
STANDOFF THAT COULD LEFT ALONE
JUST SIT FOR FOUR YEARS.
I DON'T
THINK TRUMP HAS TO ACT ON THIS,
THERE IS NO IMPERATIVE APART
FROM THE FACT THAT TRUMP FEELS
INSULTED BY THIS GUY WHO INSULTS
EVERYBODY.
BUT TRUMP MAKES HIM
LOOK POLITE.
SO APART FROM EGO AND MACHISMO I
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS
GOING ON IN THAT WHITE HOUSE.
>>WHAT ELSE IS THERE WHEN IT
COMES TO U.S. FOREIGN POLICY?
EGO AND MACHISMO PRETTY MUCH
COVERS IT.
>>IF YOU GO BACK FAR ENOUGH
THERE HAS BEEN SOME FOREIGN
AID THAT WAS HELPFUL,
RECONSTRUCTING AFTER THE WAR.
>>THERE WAS?
>>ONE THING WE DO FROM A
DIPLOMATIC STANDPOINT IS BE
CO-OPTED GOVERNMENTS, FIRST WE
GO IN WITH MONEY, YOU ARE GOING
TO HAVE OUR CORPORATIONS, U.S.
CORPORATIONS GO IN, AND WE WILL
TAKE OVER YOUR COUNTRY
ECONOMICALLY.
AND OF COURSE IF
YOU DON'T DO THAT THAT'S WHEN WE
ASSASSINATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND
BRING IN OUR OWN GUY.
BUT NONE OF THAT HERE, THIS IS
ALL ABOUT STUFF THAT GOES BANG.
>>IT'S A GOOD COP/COUP COP.
>>WHERE IS DENNIS RODMAN?
HE
CAN SOLVE THIS WHOLE THING.
IT
IS REALLY SAD TO SEE THAT OUR
TOP MILITARY LEADERS ARE EVEN
THINKING ABOUT PUTTING DIFFERENT
VARIATIONS OF APOCALYPSE IN
FRONT OF THIS CHILD, WHEN IT'S
SO CLEAR WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
IN NORTH KOREA AND HOW TO EASE
TENSIONS.
STOP HAVING REGULAR
WARGAMES.
THE UNITED STATES
NEEDS TO STOP SIMULATING AN
ATTACK ON NORTH KOREA.
SIMPLE.
THAT WOULD APPEASE SO MANY
PEOPLE.
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE
BASICALLY PRETENDING LIKE WE ARE
ALREADY ATTACKING NORTH KOREA.
IMAGINE IF NORTH KOREA PRETENDED
TO ATTACK THE UNITED STATES
EVERY YEAR FOR SHITS AND
GIGGLES.
>>TO HER POINT,
THAT'S ALL THEY WANT.
JUST STOP YOUR WARGAMES AND WE
WILL STOP OUR NUCLEAR
DEVELOPMENT.
>>AND LOOK HOW WE FREAK OUT WHEN
THEY TEST MISSILES.
>>THAT IS LOST IN THIS RHETORIC,
THEY HAVEN'T ASKED FOR
ANYTHING THAT WE COULDN'T
PROVIDE.
WE COULD STOP THE WARGAMES AND
THIS WHOLE THING STOPS.
>>I TRY TO REMIND PEOPLE AS MUCH
AS POSSIBLE, IT'S IMPORTANT
TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE WERE
TO DO SOME SORT OF STRIKE
AGAINST NORTH KOREA, EVEN IF
WE WERE TO DESTROY THEIR
ENTIRE NUCLEAR ARSENAL, THAT IS
LARGELY IRRELEVANT BECAUSE
IF THEY STRIKE BACK, WHETHER
AGAINST US, PROBABLY NOT,
JAPAN, LOWER CHANCE, BUT
DEFINITELY SOUTH KOREA,
THEY DON'T NEED NUCLEAR WEAPONS
TO KILL TENS OR HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN
JUST A FEW DAYS.
THEY CAN DO THAT WITH THEIR
CONVENTIONAL ARTILLERY THAT
IS DUG INTO THE MOUNTAINSIDE
AND WOULD BE VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE TO GUARANTEE BEING
ABLE TO DESTROY EVEN IN A
WELL-PLANNED FIRST STRIKE.
THAT IS THE NO NUCLEAR OPTION
CONSEQUENCE, HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF DEAD PEOPLE.
NUCLEAR JUST AMPSIT UP.
>>KIM JONG-UN, WHAT DOES HE
WANT?
OBVIOUSLY THE PEOPLE, A
STRIKE MIGHT BE LIKE, THANK GOD,
GET US OUT OF THIS NIGHTMARE.
YOU SEE THAT SATELLITE IMAGERY
OF NORTH KOREA, THE ENTIRE
COUNTRY IS LIVING IN SQUALOR.
OBVIOUSLY OUR COUNTRY HAS NO
INTENTION OF LIBERATING THE
NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE, WE DON'T
GIVE A SHIT, BUT KIM, WHAT DOES
HE WANT?
>>KIM WANTS TO STAY IN POWER,
THAT'S ALL HE CARES ABOUT.
HE
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT HIS PEOPLE,
WE KNOW THAT, AND AS FRANCESCA
SAID IT'S DEMONSTRABLY THE CASE
ACROSS NORTH KOREA THAT THE
PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING.
HE WANTS TO
STAY IN POWER.
THAT'S THE
INSURANCE POLICY AGAINST THERE
BEING ANY CONFLICT.
HE DOESN'T
WANT CONFLICT WITH THE U.S., SO
IT'S NOT A PART OF THE WORLD YOU
HAVE TO CONCERN YOURSELF WITH
APART FROM RHETORIC, AND THAT'S
WHAT EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON
KNOWS EXCEPT FOR DONALD TRUMP.
AS TO THE ONE THING YOU SAID,
THOSE POOR NORTH KOREANS, WHO AS
YOU SAY HAVE NOTHING, REMIND ME
OF SO MANY OF THE IRAQIS.
WE
TALKED ABOUT IRAQ, THOSE PEOPLE
HAVE IT AWFUL UNDER SADDAM
HUSSEIN, THEY WILL WELCOME
AMERICAN TROOPS, NO.
ONCE THE
BOMBS START FALLING EVERYBODY IS
A PATRIOT TO THE COUNTRY THAT
THEY ARE LIVING IN.
THE NORTH
KOREANS WOULD DIG IN.
>>THERE IS NO RIGHT WAY TO
WELCOME A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST.
>>NO ONE IS SAYING THANK YOU FOR
ENDING THIS.
>>JUST TO UPDATE US, SOME OF
THAT STUFF WAS FROM PREVIOUSLY,
BUT DONALD TRUMP AT THE STATE OF
THE UNION SAID THIS --
>>THERE IS A LOT TO CRITICIZE
AND HOW VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS
OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS HAVE
DEALT WITH NORTH KOREA, BUT HERE
IS WHAT THEY DIDN'T LEAD TO --
NUCLEAR WAR. AND THEY DID PUT
OFF THEM HAVING NUCLEAR WEAPONS
FOR A LONG TIME.
SO YES THERE
WERE MISTAKES, BUT NOT
APOCALYPTIC MISTAKES.
LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY.
>>ALSO, ALL TRUMP LIVES FOR AND
REPRESENTS IS AGGRESSION AND
PROVOCATION.
THIS IS AN
AGGRESSION AND PROVOCATION
PRESIDENT.
HE'S LIKE, IF THERE
WILL BE ANY AGGRESSION AND
PROVOCATION IT'S COMING FROM ME.
FOLDED ARMS.
>>THAT'S A GREAT POINT, HE IS
AGGRESSION AND PROVOCATION,
THAT'S FAIR.
BY THE WAY, THE WAY
WE KEPT THIS ENTIRE SITUATION
WITH NORTH KOREA KIND OF COOL
FOR ALL THIS TIME IF YOU WANT TO
CALL IT THAT, THE WAY WE HANDLED
THE SITUATION WAS WITH MONEY.
IT'S THE U.S. WAY.
WE BOUGHT KIM
OUT. AND SANCTIONS AS WELL.
THEY HAVE OBVIOUSLY BEEN
INEFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF
COMPLETELY STOPPING HIS NUCLEAR
DEVELOPMENT BUT THAT HAS
BEEN THE COURSE.
>>DO YOU MEAN AID, OFFERING THEM
SOME AMOUNT OF AID?
>>WE DRENCHED HIS DAD IN MONEY
TO KIND OF CHILL HIM OUT.
NOW IT'S ABOUT SANCTIONS, WE'VE
SEEN THAT THOSE SANCTIONS
HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN EFFECTIVE.
>>BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN TO SOME
EXTENT CONTRAVENED BY OTHER
COUNTRIES GETTING IN THERE.
>>HE MAKES BACKDOOR DEALS WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES.
>>THIS WILL HAVE TO BE OUR LAST
THOUGHT ON THIS.
>>THERE IS A NUCLEAR FOOTBALL,
IT'S NOT AN ACTUAL FOOTBALL,
SUPER BOWL SUNDAY, IT'S GOING TO
BE A FOOTBALL TOMORROW, AND IT
FOLLOWS HIM AROUND.
AND FOR
PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T AROUND OR
DON'T REMEMBER THE SECOND WORLD
WAR, IT IS VERY REAL.
ANYWAY,
JUST PUT THAT IN YOUR PIPE AND
SMOKE IT.
>>IT'S DESIGNED FOR HIM TO BE
ABLE TO ACT QUICKLY BECAUSE THAT
WAS SET UP FOR HIM TO ACT IN
RESPONSE TO WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO
BE A SOVIET THREAT.
THAT IS WHY
HE AND HE ALONE CAN LAUNCH
WITHOUT ANY APPROVAL WHATSOEVER.
BUT IT'S A HORRIFYING SCENARIO.
