as the jet stream across the Atlantic speeds up in response to climate change I think we will see eastbound flights speeding up and westbound flights slowing down my name is paul williams and i am a professor of atmospheric science in the Department of meteorology at the University of Reading we have evidence that the wind patterns between 30 and 40 thousand feet where planes crews are changing because of climate change in particular the jet stream which flows from west to east across the Atlantic Ocean for example is speeding up and that's going to make eastbound transatlantic flights faster but it's also going to make westbound crossing slower because of the stronger headwinds so I think we'll see more record-breaking ly fast eastbound transatlantic flights in future but also a lot more delayed arrivals into North America from Europe because of the stronger headwinds there might already be some evidence that this is happening because there was a five-day period a couple of years ago when the jet stream was blowing very quickly at over 200 miles an hour and in fact there were planes that took off from London Heathrow heading to New York with what should have been enough fuel to get all the way to New York but they got part way across and realized that actually they didn't have enough fuel because the headwinds were so strong they were making so little progress they had to make an emergency stop in Maine to refuel before they could continue on to JFK and in the same five-day periods of British Airways flight from JFK Airport in New York to Heathrow in London took only five hours and 16 minutes because the tail winds were so strong and that's then actually broke the record for a crossing the non Concorde record so these are the kind of things our feet will see more of in future as climate change continues to speed up the jet stream
