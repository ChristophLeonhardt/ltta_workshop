Saul Martinez 
spent six days
at a border patrol
detention center in 2014,
after a month-long
trek from El Salvador.
He was part of the
surge of children
who arrived at the
southern border alone,
mostly from Central America.
And back then, like now,
the government wrestled
with how to handle thousands
of children caught up
in the immigration system.
“We now have an actual
humanitarian crisis on the border
that only underscores the 
need to drop the politics
and fix our immigration 
system once and for all.”
Images like these
led to public outcry
on the treatment of
vulnerable children.
But he did tell his story 
when he testified
before members of Congress.
The panel wanted to hear 
why he had come.
He wanted to tell them 
what had happened
once he arrived.
He remembers the
rooms being filled
with children 
and mothers waiting
for their names to be called.
After six days, he was flown 
to a shelter in Miami,
run by a separate 
government agency.
He says it was
very comfortable.
And on Mother’s Day, 
he was finally reunited
with his mother.
Four years later, 
Saul has a green card,
a job and one year 
left of high school.
And there is 
a new crisis unfolding
at the southern border.
But for kids like Saul, it feels 
like history is repeating itself.
