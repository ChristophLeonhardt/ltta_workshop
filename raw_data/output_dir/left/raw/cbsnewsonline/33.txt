1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,936
ASIDE EVERY NOTION OF DECENCY 

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:03,869
AND DUE PROCESS. 

3
00:00:03,869 --> 00:00:04,637
NOBODY'S SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. 

4
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:07,306
BUT EACH OF YOU WILL HAVE A 

5
00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:10,510
CHANCE IN JUST FOUR WEEKS TO 

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,614
RENDER YOUR VERDICT ON THE 

7
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:22,789
DEMOCRATS' CONDUCT AT THE 

8
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:23,390
BALLOT BOX. 

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,526
ON NOVEMBER 6, YOU WILL HAVE 

10
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,828
THE CHANCE TO STOP THE RADICAL 

11
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,963
DEMOCRATS AND THAT'S WHAT 

12
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:31,330
THEY'VE BECOME. 

13
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:37,470
BY ELECTING A REPUBLICAN HOUSE 

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,842
AND A REPUBLICAN SENATE. 

15
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:44,643
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICANS. 

16
00:00:44,643 --> 00:00:47,646
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICANS. 

17
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:48,414
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICANS. 

18
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:50,850
EVERY AMERICAN HAS NOW SEEN THE 

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,752
PROFOUND STAKES IN THE UPCOMING 

20
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:53,820
ELECTION. 

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,187
YOU KNOW SEE IT. 

22
00:00:55,187 --> 00:01:01,427
WE HAVE BEEN ENERGIZED. 

23
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:02,929
WE HAVE BEEN ENERGIZED. 

24
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:03,963
IF DEMOCRATS ARE WILLING TO 

25
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:07,433
CAUSE SUCH DESTRUCTION IN THE 

26
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:14,240
PURSUIT OF POWER, JUST IMAGINE 

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,010
THE DEVASTATION THEY WOULD 

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:29,022
CAUSE IF THEY GOT THE POWER 

29
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:34,561
THEY SO DESPERATELY WANT.

30
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,728
WE HAVE POSITIONS TO BE FILLED. 

31
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:47,640
IT COULD BE THREE, FOUR, A LOT. 

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,676
AND IF YOU ALLOW THE WRONG 

33
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,144
PEOPLE TO GET INTO OFFICE, 

34
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:51,611
THINGS COULD CHANGE. 

35
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,211
THEY COULD CHANGE FAST AND 

36
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:56,616
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THAT 

37
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:56,849
HAPPEN. 

38
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:05,258
WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. 

39
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,459
IT COULD CHANGE VERY FAST. 

40
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,161
YOU DON'T SEE THAT HAPPEN. 

41
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,762
YOU DON'T HAND MATCHES TO AN 

42
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,497
ARSONIST AND YOU DON'T GIVE 

43
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:18,871
POWER TO AN ANGRY LEFT WING 

44
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:19,071
MOB. 

45
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:28,147
THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE BECOME. 

46
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:30,016
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME TOO 

47
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,617
DANGEROUS AND TOO EXTREME TO BE 

48
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:31,884
GOVERNED. 

49
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:32,685
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE IN THE RULE 

50
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:43,696
OF LAW, NOT THE RULE OF THE 

51
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:44,731
MOB. 

52
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:50,637
WE ARE DRAINING THE SWAMP AND 

53
00:02:50,637 --> 00:03:18,731
WE WANT TO BEAT THE DEMOCRATS.

54
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,633
AMERICA IS WINNING BECAUSE 

55
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:24,337
WE'RE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA 

56
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,706
FIRST. 

57
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:33,980
WE ARE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. 

58
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,618
YESTERDAY IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT 

59
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:42,555
UNEMPLOYMENT HAS FALLEN TO 

60
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:42,889
3.7%. 

61
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:48,361
THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN 

62
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:53,466
50 YEARS. 

63
00:03:53,466 --> 00:04:00,506
WE

64
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:03,776
IF I EVER SAID THAT THE FAKE 

65
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:09,949
NEWS MEDIA WOULD GO AND SAY 

66
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:10,249
IMPOSSIBLE. 

67
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:10,549
IMPOSSIBLE. 

68
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:13,886
THEY ARE FAKE. 

69
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:20,293
MANUFACTURING CONFIDENCE IS AT 

70
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,995
AN ALL-TIME HIGH. 

71
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:24,497
CONFIDENCE, VERY IMPORTANT. 

72
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,198
AT AN ALL TIME HIGH. 

73
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:32,538
WE HAVE THE BEST ECONOMY IN THE 

74
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,071
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 

75
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:37,009
THE BEST. 

76
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:39,812
WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR 

77
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,314
VETERANS. 

78
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,681
PROTECTING OUR GREAT SENIORS. 

79
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:44,217
AND REBUILDING AMERICA'S 

80
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:53,326
MILITARY MIGHT LIKE IT HASN'T 

81
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,026
BEEN BUILT BEFORE. 

82
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:55,595
BUT IF DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL, 

83
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,698
THEY WILL TRY TO PLUNGE OUR 

84
00:04:58,698 --> 00:04:59,365
COUNTRY INTO GRIDLOCK, POVERTY 

85
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:05,104
AND CHAOS AND THAT'S WHAT'S 

86
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,806
GOING TO HAPPEN. 

87
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:16,316
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO 

88
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,551
SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE YOUR TAXES. 

89
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:23,188
THEY WANT TO IMPOSE SOCIALLY. 

90
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:23,689
LIKE VENEZUELA. 

91
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,391
DISMANTLE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND 

92
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:25,891
ELIMINATE OUR BORDERS. 

93
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:30,897
THEY WANT TO HAVE NICE OPEN 

94
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:31,164
BORDERS. 

95
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,400
NO WAY. 

96
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,968
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME THE 

97
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:36,468
PARTY OF CRIME. 

98
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:40,907
THEY HAVE BECOME THE PARTY OF 

99
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:41,140
CRIME. 

100
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,775
THINK OF IT. 

101
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,646
REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY OF 

102
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:50,783
LAW AND ORDER AND JUSTICE. 

103
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,018
AND WE REALLY HAVE BECOME EVEN 

104
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,887
MORE SO THAN EVER BEFORE THE 

105
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,723
PARTY OF OPPORTUNITY AS WELL. 

106
00:05:57,723 --> 00:06:00,159
THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING. 

107
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,328
WITH CREATES WEALTH FOR 

108
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:02,762
EVERYONE. 

109
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,331
WHETHER IT'S SMALL BUSINESSES, 

110
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,033
BIG BUSINESSES, PEOPLE WANTING 

111
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:07,333
GREAT JOBS. 

112
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,000
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. 

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,870
WAGES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 19 

114
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,005
YEARS, WAGES ARE GOING UP. 

115
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,040
AND JOBS, YOU CAN CHOOSE THE 

116
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,878
JOB YOU WANT FOR THE FIRST 

117
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:26,018
TIME. 

118
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,721
WE ARE JOINED BY A NUMBER OF 

119
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,090
YOUR STATES, TERRIFIC 

120
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,325
REPUBLICAN LEADERS. 

121
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:37,029
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I 

122
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,130
WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. 

123
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,533
BUT THIS IS SUCH A BIG DAY. 

124
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,268
THIS WAS SUCH A BIG DAY. 

125
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,669
I WAS SUPPOSED TO CALL YOU. 

126
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,773
DO YOU MIND CALLING THEM AND 

127
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:50,443
TELLING THEM THAT BECAUSE OF 

128
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,545
THE FACT THAT WE ARE TODAY 

129
00:06:52,545 --> 00:07:00,553
GETTING THIS GREAT, GREAT 

130
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,120
TALENTED WONDERFUL SUPREME 

131
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,487
COURT JUDGE. 

132
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,122
CAN YOU CALL THE PEOPLE OF 

133
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,024
KANSAS AND TELL THEM WE CAN'T 

134
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:05,658
MAKE IT TONIGHT? 

135
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:10,797
I DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO. 

136
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:21,707
I DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE. 

137
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,043
SIR, WE'RE SIGNING THE NEXT 

138
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,778
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT 

139
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,045
JUSTICE. 

140
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:26,579
YOU HEARD IT. 

141
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,612
THE BIGGEST THING A PRESIDENT 

142
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:34,887
CAN DO, THEY ALWAYS SAID IT, IS 

143
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:40,860
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. 

144
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,999
WE'VE HAD TWO IN LESS THAN TWO 

145
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:47,399
YEARS I GUESS. 

146
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,569
IT'S THE BIGGEST THING YOU CAN 

147
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:49,735
DO. 

148
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,572
SO THEY SAID SIR, DO YOU MIND 

149
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,372
CANCELING KANSAS TONIGHT? 

150
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,742
I SAID NO WAY I'M CANCELING 

151
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:56,975

152
00:07:56,975 --> 00:08:05,084
NO WAY. 

153
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:05,317
NO WAY. 

154
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:06,586
I HAD THAT PHONE WORKING. 

155
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,487
I HAD THAT PHONE WORKING ON 

156
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:08,787

157
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:13,392
I HAD THAT SIGNATURE GOING ON 

158
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,660

159
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,060
AND HERE WE ARE. 

160
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,228
BY THE WAY, YOU THINK THIS 

161
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:16,962
CROWD INSIDE IS BIG? 

162
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:20,800
YOU OUGHT TO SEE THE CROWD 

163
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,204
THAT'S OUTSIDE. 

164
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,272
WE JUST PUT UP BIG MOVIE 

165
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:34,513
SCREENS BUT I THINK THIS IS 

166
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:34,780
BETTER. 

167
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,013

00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:40,479
RIGHT? 

190
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,614
AND AFTER WHAT I JUST DID FOR 

191
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,215
YOU WITH THE NEW DEAL, WITH 

192
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:46,218
MEXICO AND CANADA, I THINK WE 

193
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:55,728
SHOULD DOUBLE IT UP. 

194
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:55,961
USMCA. 

195
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:57,096
USM A. I REFUSE TO CALL IT 

196
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:02,435
NAFTA BECAUSE NAFTA WAS SUCH A 

197
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:02,802
HORRIBLE DEAL. 

198
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,003
YOU DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE. 

199
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,705
50,000 PLANTS AND FACTORIES 

200
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:06,038
EMPTIED OUT. 

201
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:10,776
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF JOBS 

202
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:10,976
LOST. 

203
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:19,418
SO, WE NEGOTIATED A NEW DEAL. 

204
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:20,786
USMCA. 

205
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,421
AND WE OPENED UP AGRICULTURE. 

206
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:22,854
WE OPENED UP DAIRY. 

207
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:25,825
WE OPENED UP A LOT OF THINGS AN 

208
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:26,392
EVERYBODY'S REALLY HAPPY. 

209
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,061
DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE DOING IN 

210
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:34,333
THE OTHER PLACES BUT THEY'RE 

211
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:34,734
REALLY HAPPY. 

212
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:35,201
SO CONGRATULATIONS. 

213
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:35,601
CONGRATULATIONS. 

214
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,169
AND WE ALSO SIGNED A GREAT NEW 

215
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,270
DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA. 

216
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,240
AND THE FARMERS WILL BE 

217
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,941
BENEFITING THERE TOO. 

218
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,677
AND, WE'RE WORKING RIGHT NOW, 

219
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:50,516
THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL. 

220
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:54,753
WE'RE WORKING ON A DEAL WITH 

221
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:54,986
CHINA. 

222
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:55,287
WE'LL SEE. 

223
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:55,587
WE'LL SEE. 

224
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:56,789
LOOK, THEY'VE BEEN HITTING US 

225
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:57,623
HARD FOR A LONG TIME. 

226
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:01,627
WE NEVER HAD A PRESIDENT THAT 

227
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:02,428
DID ANYTHING ABOUT IT. 

228
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,496
$500BILLION A YEAR. 

229
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:06,799
THAT'S A BIG ONE. 

230
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,102
SO, RIGHT NOW, WE'RE DOING 

231
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:10,469
EXTREMELY WELL. 

232
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:11,069
AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 

233
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:14,240
MAYBE WE'LL DO IT AND IF WE 

234
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,878
DON'T, WE'LL BE AN EVEN BETTER 

235
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:19,145
POSITION. 

236
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:26,185
YOU UNDERSTAND. 

237
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,888
I WANT TO THANK AN INCREDIBLE 

238
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:34,894
MAN OF INTEGRITY AND CLASS. 

239
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:35,461
YOUR GOVERNOR, JEFF COLIER. 

240
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:40,432
THERE IS JEFF? 

241

00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,238
THANKING JEFF.

00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,674

WHEN I BACKED CHRIS, AND, YOU 

245
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,209
HAVE WON HECK OF A GOVERNOR. 

246
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:52,978

247
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:56,682
ABOUT BRINGING HIM DOWN TO 

248
00:11:56,682 --> 00:12:01,320
WASHINGTON OR SOMETHING. 

249
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,854
GREAT GOVERNOR. 

250
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:05,324
A GREAT MAN.

YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM? 

267
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:50,936
HE'S BEEN FANTASTIC. 

268
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,707
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. 

269
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:55,140
THANK YOU MICHAEL. 

270
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,778
THEY ALL COME FROM KANSAS.

00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:04,283
THEY ALL COME FROM KANSAS. 

272
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,452
I GUESS THAT'S HOW WE WIN. 

273
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:13,392
WE GET FROM KANSAS, YOU WIN. 

274
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:18,731
ALONG WITH OUR AMAZING 

275
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:29,909
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO. 

276
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,812
HE IS DOING A GREAT JOB. 

277
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,916
HE'S HEADED OFF. 

278
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:37,482
THIS GUY TRAVELS. 

279
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:37,683
YEAH. 

280
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,117
GOT TO DO THAT. 

281
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,585
IF YOU'RE HOME A LOT, YOU'RE 

282
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,955
NOT DOING MUCH OF A GOOD JOB. 

283
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,023
WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB WITH 

284
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:44,456
NORTH KOREA. 

285
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:50,396
WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB WITH 

286
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:50,796
EVERYBODY. 

287
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:51,329
MIKE POMPEO FROM KANSAS. 

288
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:52,698

GOVERNMENT.

WINK HARTMAN. 

293
00:13:59,237 --> 00:14:02,675
THANK YOU WINK. 

294
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,944
THANK YOU WINK. 

295
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,914
SO, A MAN THAT'S BEEN WITH ME 

296
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:09,582
FROM THE BEGINNING. 

297
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,184
HE'S STRONG AND I HATED THAT HE 

298
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,952
RAN BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE LOVED 

299
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:18,357
TO HAVE BROUGHT HIM INTO MY 

300
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:18,791
ADMINISTRATION. 

301
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,625
IF HE LOSES. 

302
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,527
I HOPE HE LOSES BECAUSE I WANT 

303
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,628
HIM SO BADLY. 

304
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,029
BUT DON'T DO THAT. 

305
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:24,396
DON'T DO THAT. 

306
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,698
I WAS ANGRY WHEN HE DID IT. 

307
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:28,734
I SAID DON'T DO IT. 

308
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,538
SIR, I WANT TO BE THE GOVERNOR 

309
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:32,838
OF KANSAS. 

310
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,974
I LOVE MY PEOPLE. 

311
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,910
I SAID GO AHEAD. 

312
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,277
GO AHEAD. 

313
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:42,881
I WAS VERY UNHAPPY. 

314
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:46,784
I WAS VERY, VERY UNHAPPY. 

315
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:50,723
HE'S BEEN WINNING AND DOING AN 

316
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,090
INCREDIBLE JOB. 

317
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:56,161
I WANT TO INTRODUCE THE NEXT 

318
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:56,928
GOVERNOR OF KANSAS. 

319
00:14:56,928 --> 00:15:18,751
CHRIS KOBAK. 

320
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,798
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP, WELCOME TO 

321
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:39,938
TRUMP COUNTRY. 

322
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:42,407
IT IS SUCH AN HONOR AND A 

323
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:43,075
BLESSING TO HAVE PRESIDENT 

324
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,078
TRUMP HERE IN THE CITY WHERE I 

325
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:46,344
GREW UP. 

326
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:50,683
THIS IS MY CAMPAIGN IN THE 

327
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:58,891
STATE WE ALL LOVE. 

328
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,893
I WANT TO GIVE PRESIDENT TRUMP 

329
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:01,793
CREDIT FOR SOMETHING. 

330
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:07,299
THE MOST IMPORTANT IS STOPPING 

331
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:29,555
THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. 

332
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,590
I'M SO GLAD THAT AMERICA HAS A 

333
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,457
PRESIDENT WHO GETS IT. 

334
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:35,126
AND KNOWS THAT ILLEGAL MEANS 

335
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:42,767
ILLEGAL. 

336
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,703
I WANT TO TELL YOU A QUICK 

337
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:45,804
SHORT STORY ABOUT ILLEGAL 

338
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:46,137
IMMIGRATION. 

339
00:16:46,137 --> 00:16:49,174
I WAS WORKING ON THIS ISSUE IN 

340
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,075
THE TIME OF 9/11. 

341
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,877
I WAS THERE DURING 9/11 AND WE 

342
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:52,978
ALL REMEMBER HOW THE WORLD 

343
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:53,312
CHANGED. 

344
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,782
BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING 

345
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,150
YOU MAY NOT KNOW. 

346
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,986
ALL 19 HIJACKERS CAME INTO THIS 

347
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,421
COUNTRY LEGALLY ON TEMPORARY 

348
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:02,688
VISAS. 

349
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,692
FIVE OF THEM BECAME ILLEGAL 

350
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,593
MOSTLY BY OVERSTAYING THEIR 

351
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:07,893
VISAS. 

352
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,295
FOUR OF THOSE FIVE WERE STOPPED 

353
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,632
BY STATE AND LOCAL LAW 

354
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,032
ENFORCEMENT FOR SPEEDING 

355
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:20,739
VIOLATIONS. 

356
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,340
THE COPS DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE 

357
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,209
HERE ILLEGALLY AND DIDN'T MAKE 

358
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:24,509
AN ARREST. 

359
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:26,678
THEY COULD HAVE IF THEY HAD 

360
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,380
THAT INFORMATION AT THEIR 

361
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,014
FINGERTIPS. 

362
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,849
THREE OF THOSE FOUR ILLEGAL 

363
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,317
ALIENS THEY ARRESTED WERE 

364
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:32,784
PILOTS. 

365
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:34,853
SO, IF THEY HAD MADE THOSE 

366
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,524
ARRESTS, THEY COULD HAVE 

367
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,391
STOPPED 9/11 FROM HAPPENING. 

368
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,026
THOSE NUMBERS HAVE SHAPED MY 

369
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:41,259
CAREER. 

370
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:43,328
THE GRAVITY OF THAT HAS NEVER 

371
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:43,595
LEFT ME. 

372
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:43,995
AND I WILL NOT. 

373
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:45,964
AND I KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL 

374

378
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:07,986
STOPPING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS 

379
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,889
ABOUT OUR NATION'S SECURITY AND 

380
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:19,131
THAT COMES FIRST. 

381
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,799
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS AN ISSUE 

382
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,801
IN THE CAMPAIGN FOR GOVERNOR. 

383
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,337

IS THAT FAIR? 

400
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:09,214

THERE'S ANOTHER BIG ISSUE THAT

PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I HAVE BOTH 

410
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,186

BECAUSE OF THE LAW THAT I

PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP.

EVERY TIME AN ALIEN VOTES,

EVERY TIME AN ALIEN VOTES, IT 

428

CARE ABOUT VOTER CANCELLATION 

433
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:38,937

DON'T CARE ABOUT U.S. CITIZENS

443
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:13,505
IN KANSAS, OUR STATE TAXES ARE 

444
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:14,339
THE HIGHEST IN THE REGION. 

445
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,542

THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN KANSAS

YOU BETTER GET OUT AND VOTE FOR 

601
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,407
STEVE WATKINS, PLEASE. 

602
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:12,710
THE MAJORITY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS 

603
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,511
HAVE ALREADY SPONSORED A 

604
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:25,423
SOCIALIST TAKEOVER OF HEALTH 

605
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,424
CARE. 

606
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:26,957
THE DEMOCRATS' PLAN WOULD 

607
00:30:26,957 --> 00:30:28,326
DESTROY HEALTH CARE FOR 20 

608
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:28,726
MILLION SENIORS. 

609
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,896
WE WANT TO PROTECT MEDICARE. 

610
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,431
WE WILL AS REPUBLICANS PROTECT 

611
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,133

613
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:42,840

00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,245
AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT 

615
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,346
AMERICANS WITH PREEXISTING 

616
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:48,646
CONDITIONS. 

617
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:52,950
WE WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR GREAT 

618
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,186
AMERICANS WITH PREEXISTING 

619
00:30:55,186 --> 00:31:02,727
CONDITIONS. 

620
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:03,928
TODAY'S DEMOCRATS HAVE EMBRACED 

621
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:05,095
RADICALISM AND OPEN BORDERS. 

622
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:06,831
IF YOU DON'T HAVE BORDERS, YOU 

623
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:08,733
DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY FOLKS, YOU 

624
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:09,299
DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY. 

625
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,669
EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT IN THE 

626
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,872
U.S. SENATE HAS SIGNED UP FOR 

627
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:16,941
THE OPEN BORDERS AND IT'S A 

628
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,176
BILL CALLED THE OPEN BORDERS 

629
00:31:19,176 --> 00:31:19,544
BILL. 

630
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,545
WHAT'S GOING ON? 

631
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:26,918
AND IT'S WRITTEN BY, GUESS WHO? 

632
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:34,158
DIANE FEINSTEIN. 

633
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:39,797
REMEMBER THE LEAKING, RIGHT? 

634
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:43,401
THE LEAKING DIANE FEINSTEIN. 

635
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,470
DID YOU LEAK, DIANE? 

636
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,606
NO, NO, NO. 

637
00:31:49,606 --> 00:31:49,773
NO. 

638
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:50,040
I DIDN'T. 

639
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,574
I DON'T THINK. 

640
00:31:50,574 --> 00:31:50,808
WAIT. 

641
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,043
DID WE LEAK? 

642
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,211
NO, HE SAID NO. 

643
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:54,846
WE DIDN'T LEAK. 

644
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:55,046
OKAY. 

645
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,247
WAS THAT THE WORST BODY 

646
00:31:56,247 --> 00:32:01,052
LANGUAGE YOU HAVE EVER SEEN? 

647
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,187
WAS THAT THE WORST? 

648
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:03,488
NO. 

649
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,155
I DIDN'T LEAK. 

650
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:09,861
NO, SHE DIDN'T LEAK. 

651
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,964
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DEALING 

652
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:13,331
WITH. 

653
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,967
IF THE DEMOCRATS' BILL BECOMES 

654
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,603
LAW, DRUGS AND CRIME WOULD POUR 

655
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:22,073
INTO YOUR NATION LIKE NEVER 

656
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:22,406
EVER BEFORE. 

657
00:32:22,406 --> 00:32:24,876
DEMOCRATS ALSO SUPPORT DEADLY 

658
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,877
SANCTUARY CITIES THAT RELEASE 

659
00:32:26,877 --> 00:32:29,280
VIOLENT PREDATORS AND BLOOD 

660
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:34,886
THIRSTY KILLERS LIKE MS-13 INTO 

661
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:39,089
OUR COMMUNITIES. 

662
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:42,794
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THIS SHOULD 

663
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,898
BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-ABIDING 

664
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:47,198
AMERICANS. 

665
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:50,201
NOT CRIMINAL ILLEGALS. 

666
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,035
AND, REPUBLICANS STAND PROUDLY 

667
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:56,741
WITH THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF 

668
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:56,941
ICE. 

669
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:57,308
BORDER PATROL. 

670
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:06,117
AND LAW ENFOREMENT. 

671
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:10,922
THEY WANTED TO FUND ICE, CAN 

672
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:11,489
YOU BELIEVE THAT? 

673
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,790
WHEN MS-13 SEES ICE COMING THEY 

674
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,224
SAY LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. 

675
00:33:14,224 --> 00:33:15,559
BUT THEY CAN'T. 

676
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:16,093
BECAUSE THEY GET CAUGHT. 

677
00:33:16,093 --> 00:33:24,936
THEY GET THROWN OUT OF THE 

678
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:25,203
COUNTRY. 

679
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:28,606
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO GET RID 

680
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:28,839
OF US. 

681
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,008
ICE ARE GREAT AMERICANS. 

682
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:30,841
THEY HAPPEN TO BE TOUGH PEOPLE. 

683
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:37,014
I THINK WE NEED SOME TOUGH 

684
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:37,615
PEOPLE. 

685
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:37,848
TOUGH! 

686
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:38,382
MS-13 DOESN'T LIKE ICE. 

687
00:33:38,382 --> 00:33:43,821
AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE ICE. 

688
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:44,722
BUT THEY'RE GREAT AMERICANS, 

689
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:49,127
THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND 

690
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,193
THEY'RE NOT TREATED PROPERLY. 

691
00:33:50,193 --> 00:33:52,096
THEY GO INTO A COMMUNITY. 

692
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,531
I GREW UP IN THAT VICINITY. 

693
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,233
I KNOW EVERY COMMUNITY OUT 

694
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:55,533
THERE. 

695
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,701
THEY GO INTO THESE COMMUNITIES 

696
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:01,505
AND THESE ARE ROUGH, ROUGH 

697
00:34:01,505 --> 00:34:02,807
PEOPLE. 

698
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:03,040
MS-13. 

699
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,643
HOW THEY EVEN COME IN, SO MANY 

700
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:06,043
PEOPLE BEFORE US. 

701
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:09,313
AND OUR LAWS ARE SO BAD. 

702
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:13,317
AND WE NEED MORE REPUBLICANS. 

703
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:14,083
BUT THEY COME IN. 

704
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:14,618
AND, WE SEND ICE. 

705
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:19,623
AND THEY GET IN THERE AND THEY 

706
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:20,690
GET THEM OUT. 

707
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,527
IT'S LIKE WE'RE LIBERATING 

708
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:22,893
THEM. 

709
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:25,830
IT'S LIKE A WAR. 

710
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,429
A FOREIGN INVADER. 

711
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:31,335
A FOREIGN INVADER FINALLY IS 

712
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:31,835
BEING TAKEN OUT. 

713
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:32,703
THEY'RE LIBERATING THE COUNTRY, 

714
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,772
THE CITY OR THE TOWN. 

715
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:39,976
THESE PEOPLE ARE LIBERATING 

716
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:43,347
THESE TOWNS. 

717
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,782
YOU KNOW THE STORY, YOU'VE 

718
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:45,114
HEARD IT. 

719
00:34:45,114 --> 00:34:49,654
THEY CUT PEOPLE UP BECAUSE THEY 

720
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,355
DON'T WANT TO USE GUNS BECAUSE 

721
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,456
IT'S NOT PAINFUL ENOUGH. 

722
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:55,192
AN WHEN THEY SAID ANIMALS. 

723
00:34:55,192 --> 00:34:56,793
NANCY PELOSI SAID HOW DARE YOU 

724
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:58,896
SPEAK THAT WAY ABOUT A HUMAN 

725
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:02,700
BEING. 

726
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,737
THIS WOMAN JUST SAID IT TO ME. 

727
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,806
HOW DARE YOU CALL THEM. 

728
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:10,841
THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS. 

729
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:11,975
THESE ARE ANIMALS, FOLKS. 

730
00:35:11,975 --> 00:35:12,643
THESE ARE ANIMALS. 

731
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:18,382
AN WE NEED LAW ENFORCEMENT AND 

732
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,718
ICE AND BORDER PATROL. 

733
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:25,423
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. 

734
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,958
AND IF YOUR COMMUNITY HAS A 

735
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,092
PROBLEM, DON'T WORRY. 

736
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:29,393
GIVE US A CALL. 

737
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,228
DEMOCRATS ARE ALSO FIGHTING TO 

738
00:35:31,228 --> 00:35:33,564
GIVE WELFARE AND FREE HEALTH 

739
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:34,198
CARE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS. 

740
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:37,367
PAID FOR BY YOU THE AMERICAN 

741
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:38,836
TAXPAYER. 

742
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,672
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

743
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:45,610
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT THE 

744
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,811
PUBLIC BENEFITS MUST BE 

745
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,214
PROTECTED FOR THE TRULY NEEDY 

746
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:50,815
AMERICANS. 

747
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,785
AMERICANS THAT NEED HELP. 

748
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,587
NOT ILLEGAL ALIENS. 

749
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,789
IF YOU WANT, SAY, IF YOU WANT A 

750
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:06,897
BORDER, IF YOU WANT AMERICA TO 

751
00:36:06,897 --> 00:36:08,766
REMAIN A SOVEREIGN GREAT 

752
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:09,867
COUNTRY THEN ORGANIZE, 

753
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,470
MOBILIZE, REGISTER AND VOTE 

754
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,805
REPUBLICAN. 

755
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:17,074
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICAN VOTES. 

756
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,410
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT SAFETY. 

757
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,145
AND IT'S ALSO ABOUT PROSPERITY. 

758
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:24,549
SINCE THE ELECTION, WE HAVE 

759
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:29,353
CREATED OVER 4.2 MILLION NEW 

760
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,821
JOBS AND LIFTED ALMOST 4 

761
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,823
MILLION AMERICANS OFF OF FOOD 

762
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:37,428
STAMPS. 

763
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:42,900
AND WE HADED NEARLY ONE-HALF 

764
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,668
MILLION MANUFACTURING JOBS. 

765
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:44,602
THINK ABOUT THAT. 

766
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,270
HAVE I EVER SAID THAT? 

767
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:46,670
LOOK HOW MANY. 

768
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:46,937
OH MAN. 

769
00:36:46,937 --> 00:36:53,577
YOU ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE 

770
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:53,810
PEOPLE. 

771
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,212
LOOK HOW MANY REPORTERS. 

772
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:58,616
LOOK. 

773
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,819
THAT'S A LOT. 

774
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:02,119
WOW. 

775
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,353
YOU KNOW WHAT I CALL IT? 

776
00:37:03,353 --> 00:37:07,792
I CALL IT THE ACADEMY AWARDS. 

777
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:17,368
THAT'S THE ACADEMY AWARDS. 

778
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,003
OUR POLLS CAME OUT. 

779
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,638
THEY NEVER REPORT THAT. 

780
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,340
THEY NEVER DO. 

781
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,340
AND IT'S MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT. 

782
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,742
THEY SAY WHEN THEY DON'T WANT 

783
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,710
TO TALK ABOUT IT, THAT MEANS 

784
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,477
THEY'RE VOTING FOR TRUMP. 

785
00:37:27,477 --> 00:37:30,280
AM I SUPPOSED TO BE THRILLED? 

786
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,817
BUT WE'LL TAKE IT, RIGHT? 

787
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,786
WE'LL TAKE IT. 

788
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:36,554
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN 2016. 

789
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:41,759
A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO 

790
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,459
TALK ABOUT IT. 

791
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:43,360
AND, OKAY. 

792
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,427
BUT NOW, THEY LEARNED. 

793
00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:45,696
THEY LEARNED THEIR LESSON. 

794
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:50,835
WHEN THEY DON'T TALK, THEY'RE 

795
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,870
TRUMP VOTERS. 

796
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:57,675
ALL ACTION. 

797
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:58,208
ALL ACTION. 

798
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:58,475
NO TALK. 

799
00:37:58,475 --> 00:38:01,579
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT 

800
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:06,884
HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 

801
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:12,123
RECORDED HISTORY. 

802
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,692
AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY HAS

00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:22,299
REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE EVER 

804
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:22,566
RECORDED. 

805
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,034
BY THE WAY, BY THE WAY. 

806
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:26,837

00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,539

AFRICAN-AMERICANS? 

812
00:38:34,477 --> 00:38:34,878
HOW DO YOU WIN? 

813
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:39,883
HOW DO YOU BEAT US ON THAT? 

814
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:42,119
IT'S ONLY HABIT. 

815
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,722
BECAUSE FOR 100 YEARS, AFRICAN-

816
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,223
AMERICANS HAVE GONE WITH 

817
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:46,523
DEMOCRATS. 

818
00:38:46,523 --> 00:38:48,959
BUT NOW, THEY'RE CHANGING AND 

819
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:58,436

BIG JIM. 

826
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:11,515
WE COULD USE HIM RIGHT NOW IN 

827
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,017

00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,480
EVERY NIGHT BEFORE I GO TO 

882
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,720

CORY BOOKER. 

885
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:14,898
POCAHONTAS. 

886
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:18,102
I'VE GOT MORE INDIAN BLOOD IN 

887
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,604
ME THAN POCAHONTAS AND I HAVE 

888
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:20,837
NONE. 

889
00:42:20,837 --> 00:42:21,071
SADLY. 

890
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:21,404
I HAVE NONE. 

891
00:42:21,404 --> 00:42:26,744
BUT I HAVE MORE THAN SHE DOES. 

892
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:30,848
THEY SAID TO HER WHY DO YOU SAY 

893
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,115
YOU'RE OF INDIAN HERITAGE? 

894
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:35,319
MY MOTHER SAID I HAD HIGH 

895
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:35,619
CHEEKBONES. 

896
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,021
DO YOU HAVE ANY DOCUMENTATION? 

897
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:37,354
NO WE DON'T. 

898
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:40,624
WELL I HAVE HIGH CHEEKBONES 

899
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:40,991

900
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:41,725
HEY, MAYBE I'M AND INDIAN. 

901
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,094
AND I'M GOING TO DO VERY WELL. 

902
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:47,297
BUT THINK OF IT. 

903
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:47,931
THIS IS HER REASON. 

904
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:50,400
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO BE CAREFUL. 

905
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,570
I'M TAKING OUT SO MANY OF THESE 

906
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:53,803
PEOPLE. 

907
00:42:53,803 --> 00:42:54,872
I'M HITTING THEM SO HARD, 

908
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:58,342
THEY'RE DISAPPEARING AND I 

909
00:42:58,342 --> 00:42:59,309
DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. 

910
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:00,444
I MAY GET SOMEBODY THAT'S GOOD 

911
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,613
TO RUN AGAINST ME AND THAT 

912
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:03,113
WOULD NOT BE GOOD. 

913
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:05,883
I'LL TAKE OUT ALL THE EASY ONES 

914
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,718
AN MAYBE I'LL GET STUCK WITH 

915
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,219
SOMEBODY WHO IS ACTUALLY GOOD. 

916
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:14,825
BUT I DON'T SEE ANY ON THAT 

917
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:18,395
SIDE. 

918
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,898
WELL, SLEEPY JOE BIDEN WHO RAN 

919
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:24,368
FOR PRESIDENT TWO OR THREE 

920
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:24,768
TIMES, YOU KNOW. 

921
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:30,140
I THINK I REMEMBER A THIRD TIME 

922
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,608
IN THERE. 

923
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:34,645
BUT HE HAD 1% WITH AN ARROW 

924
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:35,012
POINTING LEFT. 

925
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:38,015
THEN OBAMA TOOK HIM OFF THE 

926
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:38,315
TRASH HEAP. 

927
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:39,549
WELL HE'S ONE OF THE PEOPLE. 

928
00:43:39,549 --> 00:43:42,119
REMEMBER, HE CHALLENGED ME TO A 

929
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:42,352
FIGHT. 

930
00:43:42,352 --> 00:43:46,790
I'D LIKE TO TAKE HIM BEHIND THE 

931
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:46,990
BARN. 

932
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:47,424
I'D LOVE THAT. 

933
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:53,030
THAT WOULDN'T LAST LONG. 

934
00:43:53,030 --> 00:44:04,842
THAT WOULD NOT LAST LONG. 

935
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,076
THAT WOULDN'T LAST LONG. 

936
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,410
HE'S DOWN AND NEVER GET UP. 

937
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,178
HE WILL NEVER GET UP. 

938
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:11,014
NO, I HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR 

939
00:44:11,014 --> 00:44:11,414
CANDIDATES ALONE. 

940
00:44:11,414 --> 00:44:13,450
SOMEBODY ACTUALLY SAID YOU HIT 

941
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:20,824
THESE CANDIDATES REALLY HARD. 

942
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,259
THERE'S A NONCANDIDATE YOU 

943
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:22,459
KNOW. 

944
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:22,792
BLOOMENTHOL. 

945
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:26,864
HE SAID WHEN I WAS IN THE 

946
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,365
DONANG PROVINCE IN VIETNAM AND 

947
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:32,903
MEN WERE GOING LEFT AND RIGHT 

948
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:33,803
OF ME, THEY'RE DYING. 

949
00:44:33,803 --> 00:44:35,773
BEING STRUCK BY BULLETS BUT I 

950
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:36,640
WENT BACK TO THEIR RESCUE. 

951
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,774
I WENT BACK AND I GOT THEM. 

952
00:44:37,774 --> 00:44:42,346
AND THEN I MADE A SECOND 

953
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:42,613
ATTEMPT. 

954
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:43,847
AND BULLETS ARE GOING LEFT AND 

955
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,749
RIGHT AND OVER MY SHOULDERS AND 

956
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:46,750
THEY'RE HITTING MY MEN. 

957
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,519
AND I USED TO THINK, WOW, 

958
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,753
THAT'S A PRETTY GREAT GUY. 

959
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:53,523
THEN I FOUND OUT HE'S A FRAUD. 

960
00:44:53,523 --> 00:45:00,164
HE NEVER WAS IN VIETNAM. 

961
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:00,964
AND HE STOPPED CAMPAIGNING 

962
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:05,803
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY HE 

963
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:06,537
COULD WIN. 

964
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:06,770
NO WAY. 

965
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,338
AND BECAUSE IT'S CONNECTICUT, 

966
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:10,407
WHERE, I GUESS, ONLY A 

967
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:11,375
DEMOCRAT, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? 

968
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:15,979
THAT'S WHY CONNECTICUT'S SUCH A 

969
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:17,081
MESS RIGHT NOW. 

970
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:18,482
ONLY A DEMOCRAT, IT'S A MESS. 

971
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:22,886
GENERAL ELECTORATE JUST MOVED 

972
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:23,086
OUT. 

973
00:45:23,086 --> 00:45:25,455
THAT DOESN'T HELP. 

974
00:45:25,455 --> 00:45:26,522
THEN I SEE HIM TALKING ABOUT A 

975
00:45:26,522 --> 00:45:28,258
MAN WHO IS NUMBER ONE IN YALE. 

976
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,093
WHO HAS A PERFECT RECORD. 

977
00:45:30,093 --> 00:45:30,794
THE MOST INCREDIBLE RECORD. 

978
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:36,300
ONE OF THE REASONS I PICKED 

979
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,000
HIM. 

980
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,138
HE'S LIKE A PERFECT PERSON. 

981
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:45,909
AND DA NANG DICK WHO SAID HE 

982
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,978
WAS A GREAT WAR HERO AND HE 

983
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,545
NEVER SAW THE COUNTRY. 

984
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:56,854
THIS WASN'T LIKE SAYING YEAH, I 

985
00:45:56,854 --> 00:46:00,791
WAS IN THE ARMY. 

986
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:02,159
THIS IS DA NANG. 

987
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,093
HE'S TAKING BULLETS LEFT AND 

988
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:03,460
RIGHT. 

989
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:10,600
AND HE NEVER SAW THE PLACE. 

990
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:16,606
HE WAS IN THE RESERVES. 

991
00:46:16,606 --> 00:46:23,880
I DEMAND HONESTY, INTEGRITY. 

992
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:39,496
THAT'S THE GUY THAT LIED. HOW 

993
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:41,431
BAD. 

994
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:45,502
YOU DON'T WANT THOSE PEOPLE IN 

995
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:45,769
OFFICE. 

996
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,705
AND COMPARE THAT WITH WHAT YOU 

997
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:52,209
HAVE SEEN WITH JOHN CORNEN WHO 

998
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:54,211
ASKED THAT QUESTION TO DIANE 

999
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:54,511
FEINSTEIN. 

1000
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:57,047
AND, LINDSAY GRAHAM WHO DID 

1001
00:46:57,047 --> 00:47:07,291
SUCH A GREAT JOB. 

1002
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,825
HOW GOOD WAS LINDSEY? 

1003
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:12,161
HOW GOOD WAS LINDSEY? 

1004
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:12,896
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 

1005
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:14,764
HE WAS SPEAKING FROM THE HEART. 

1006
00:47:14,764 --> 00:47:16,800
BY THE WAY, IT TOOK A WEEK, BUT 

1007
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,472
THE EXTRA WEEK WAS A GREAT 

1008
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:22,873
THING. 

1009
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,308
BECAUSE IT SHOWED NO 

1010
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:24,675
CORROBORATION. 

1011
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:24,975
NO NOTHING. 

1012
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:28,978
BY THE WAY, NO NOTHING. 

1013
00:47:28,978 --> 00:47:29,912
NO NOTHING. 

1014
00:47:29,912 --> 00:47:38,722
HOW GOOD WAS SENATOR SUSAN 

1015
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:38,988
COLLINS? 

1016
00:47:38,988 --> 00:47:39,322
REALLY GOOD. 

1017
00:47:39,322 --> 00:47:42,092
REALLY GOOD. 

1018
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:46,195
AND CHUCK GRASSLEY. 

1019
00:47:46,195 --> 00:47:47,330
I TELL YOU WHAT. 

1020
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:48,432
CHUCK WAS GREAT. 

1021
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:51,068
HE'S GOT TO BE VERY HAPPY WITH 

1022
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:54,871
WHAT WE DID. 

1023
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:57,140
GREAT CHUCK FROM IOWA. 

1024
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,576
GREAT STATE. 

1025
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,446
AND MITCH MCCONNELL. 

1026
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:02,713
HOW GOOD? 

1027
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,180
HOW GOOD? 

1028
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,147
HE WAS GREAT. 

1029
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,416
HE WORKED HARD. 

1030
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:12,155
AND WE GOT OURSELVES THE FINEST 

1031
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:12,756
LEGAL MIND. 

1032
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:14,825
ONE OF THE FINEST HUMAN BEINGS. 

1033
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:17,427
AND HA HIS FAMILY TOOK, THE 

1034
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:20,430
HORROR THEY HAD TO ENDURE BY 

1035
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,799
THESE PEOPLE LIKE BLUMENTHAL 

1036
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:27,904
AND CORY BOOKER WHO WAS A 

1037
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:29,139
DISASTER AS THE MAYOR. 

1038
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:32,442
WHAT THEY HAD TO TAKE WAS A 

1039
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:32,742
DISGRACE. 

1040
00:48:32,742 --> 00:48:33,810
THE ONLY REASON TO VOTE 

1041
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:37,047
DEMOCRAT IS IF YOU'RE TIRED OF 

1042
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:37,314
WINNING. 

1043
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:37,547
RIGHT? 

1044
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,115
TIRED OF WINNING. 

1045
00:48:39,115 --> 00:48:42,586
WE WANT TO WIN, WIN, WIN. 

1046
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,655
NEVER GET TIRED OF IT. 

1047
00:48:45,655 --> 00:48:49,159

REPUBLICANS PASS THE BIGGEST 

1060
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:28,432
PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS AND REFORMS 

1061
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:37,474
IN AMERICAN HISTORY BY FAR. 

1062
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,208
WE ALSO PASS VETERAN'S CHOICE. 

1063
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:39,509

1064
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,178
GIVE OUR VETERANS THE RIGHT TO

14 DAYS. 

1071
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:52,289
SIX DAYS. 

1072
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:55,792
THEY GO OUT AND THEY SEE A 

1073
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:56,192

1093
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:12,369

AMERICAN ARMED FORCES. 

1096
00:51:19,008 --> 00:51:21,644
THE SPACE FORCE. 

1097
00:51:21,644 --> 00:51:25,314
WE'RE VERY SERIOUS. 

1098
00:51:25,314 --> 00:51:26,582
AND IT'S HAPPENING QUICKLY. 

1099
00:51:26,582 --> 00:51:26,983

THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT. 

1101
00:51:27,483 --> 00:51:29,585
YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHERE IT'S AT. 

1102
00:51:29,585 --> 00:51:31,521
DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT, BUT IT'S 

1103
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:32,856
RIGHT. 

1104
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:38,028
THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT. 

1105
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:43,233

1107
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:47,537
I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES 

1108
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:50,740
FROM THE HORRIBLE ONE SIDED 

1109
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:54,778
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. 

1110
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:55,745
BEFORE I CAME PRESIDENT, THEY 

1111
00:51:55,745 --> 00:52:02,052
WERE TAKING OVER THE MIDDLE 

1112
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:02,752
EAST. 

1113
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:07,858
THEY WERE TAKING SYRIA, YEMEN. 

1114
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:08,458
THEY WERE TAKING EVERYTHING. 

1115
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,161
SINCE I TOOK OVER, THAT 

1116
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:11,827
OPERATION, THAT HORRIBLE, 

1117
00:52:11,827 --> 00:52:22,772
HORRIBLE DEAL THAT WAS, THINK 

1118
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,106
OF IT. 

1119
00:52:24,106 --> 00:52:26,676
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION 

1120
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:27,443
GAVE IRAN $150 MILLION. 

1121
00:52:27,443 --> 00:52:33,250
AND EVEN CRAZIER, THEY GAVE HIM 

1122
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,250
$1.8 BILLION IN CASH. 

1123
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:34,751
CASH. 

1124
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:35,452
AIRPLANES FULL OF CASH. 

1125
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,654
IN FACT, I GOT IN. 

1126
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:38,755
I SAID, DOES THE PRESIDENT OF 

1127
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,591
THE UNITED STATES ACTUALLY HAVE 

1128
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:46,997
THE POWER TO GIVE AWAY $1.8 

1129
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:47,664
BILLION IN CASH? 

1130
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,365
THE ANSWER IS ACTUALLY NO, THEY 

1131
00:52:49,365 --> 00:52:49,766
DON'T. 

1132
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:52,135
WHAT THEY DID THERE IS A 

1133
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:52,402
DISGRACE. 

1134
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:54,271
THEY GAVE HIM 1.8 IN ORDER TO 

1135
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:55,271
HAVE A TERRIBLE DEAL. 

1136
00:52:55,271 --> 00:52:58,641
WELL, THAT WAS A HOSTAGE. 

1137
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:04,481
THEY PAID A BILLION EIGHT FOR 

1138
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,081
HOSTAGES. 

1139
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:05,481
CAN YOU IMAGINE? 

1140
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:10,820
AND WE GOT OUR HOSTAGES BACK 

1141
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,223
FROM NORTH KOREA. 

1142
00:53:14,223 --> 00:53:15,791
WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. 

1143
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:17,394
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS. 

1144
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,863
BUT I THINK GOOD THINGS HAPPEN. 

1145
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,230
NO MORE MISSILE TESTING. 

1146
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,832
NO MORE ROCKET TESTING. 

1147
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,534
NO MORE NUCLEAR TESTING. 

1148
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,669
WE GOT THE REMAINS OF OUR 

1149
00:53:26,669 --> 00:53:30,807
GREAT, GREAT HEROS FROM 75 

1150
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,075
YEARS AGO BACK. 

1151
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:33,209
AND THEY KEEP COMING. 

1152
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:42,085
AND, WE GOT OUR HOSTAGES BACK. 

1153
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,286
AND GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING. 

1154
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:43,553
YOU KNOW? 

1155
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:48,291
JUST BEFORE WE SIGN THE DEAL 

1156
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:50,426
WITH CANADA AND MEXICO. 

1157
00:53:50,426 --> 00:53:50,827
WHO KNOWS. 

1158
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:51,895
IT'S A DEAL. 

1159
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:52,195
WHO KNOWS? 

1160
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:53,897
I LIKE IT. 

1161
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,698
IT TAKES TALL PRESSURE OFF. 

1162
00:53:55,698 --> 00:53:55,998
WHO KNOWS? 

1163
00:53:55,998 --> 00:53:56,700
WHO KNOWS? 

1164
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:02,872
BUT I THINK WE'RE DOING VERY 

1165
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:06,776
WELL. 

1166
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:09,044
THE FAKE NEWS SAYS WHY AREN'T 

1167
00:54:09,044 --> 00:54:09,579
YOU GOING FASTER? 

1168
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,514
LISTEN, I JUST GOT BACK THREE 

1169
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:12,682
MONTHS AGO. 

1170
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:13,983
I WAS THERE WITH KIM JONG UN. 

1171
00:54:13,983 --> 00:54:16,286
I WAS THERE THREE MONTHS AGO, 

1172
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:16,619
CHAIRMAN KIM. 

1173
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:19,122
THEY SAID WHY AREN'T YOU GOING 

1174
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:20,857
FASTER? 

1175
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:22,792
I SAID WHAT HAVE PEOPLE DONE 

1176
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:26,763
FOR 75 YEARS? 

1177
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,766
THIS IS THREE MONTHS. 

1178
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,802
ONE OF THE ANCHORS SAID WHY HAS 

1179
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:34,237
THE PRESIDENT GIVEN AWAY SO 

1180
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:34,537
MUCH? 

1181
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,471
WHAT HAVE I GIVEN? 

1182
00:54:35,471 --> 00:54:37,172
I HAVEN'T GIVEN ANYTHING. 

1183
00:54:37,172 --> 00:54:47,484
WE GOT OUR HOSTAGES BACK. 

1184
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:48,384
FOR NOTHING. 

1185
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:49,952
OUT OF RESPECT. 

1186
00:54:49,952 --> 00:54:54,957
THE TESTING ALL STOPPED. 

1187
00:54:54,957 --> 00:54:55,958
THE NUCLEAR TESTING. 

1188
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:57,193
I SAID TELL ME. 

1189
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:58,662
WHAT HAVE I GIVEN? 

1190
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,230
WELL, YOU AGREED TO MEET. 

1191
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,498
THAT DIDN'T COST ME VERY MUCH. 

1192
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:02,699
I GET TO MEET. 

1193
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:03,132
I LIKE TO MEET. 

1194
00:55:03,132 --> 00:55:14,276
WHAT DO WE LOSE BY MEETING? 

1195
00:55:14,276 --> 00:55:19,215
I ASKED THE PREVIOUS 

1196
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:19,916
ADMINISTRATION. 

1197
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:21,317
I AGREED TO MEET. 

1198
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,719
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW WELL WE 

1199
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:29,826
WOULD DO IF WE HAD FAIR PRESS? 

1200
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:30,827
CAN YOU IMAGINE? 

1201
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,862
INSTEAD OF FAKE NEWS. 

1202
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:33,930
I AGREED TO MEET. 

1203
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,164
I'M SORRY. 

1204
00:55:35,164 --> 00:55:35,932
I AGREED TO MEET. 

1205
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:37,867
THEN THEY SAID THAT YOU KNOW 

1206
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:41,137
THE RHETORIC WAS EXTREMELY 

1207
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:42,539
TOUGH THAT FIRST COUPLE OF 

1208
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:42,772
MONTHS. 

1209
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:44,941
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID AT MY 

1210
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:45,374
MEETING WITH HIM. 

1211
00:55:45,374 --> 00:55:46,743
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE BY 

1212
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:47,343
FAR IS NORTH KOREA. 

1213
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,112
THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO WAR. 

1214
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:50,413
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 

1215
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:51,681
WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. 

1216
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,148
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. 

1217
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:56,219
AND I SAID TO SOMEBODY IN THEIR 

1218
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:58,054
ADMINISTRATION, HAVE YOU EVER 

1219
00:55:58,054 --> 00:55:58,888
TALKED? 

1220
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:03,226
HAVE YOU EVER AGREED TO MEET? 

1221
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:07,230
WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT. 

1222
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:07,730
WE'LL MEET ANYBODY. 

1223
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:11,368
BUT WE HAVE THEM COMING IN. 

1224
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,268
IT'S THE GREATEST POWER WE EVER 

1225
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:12,368
HAD. 

1226
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:27,183
GREATEST POWER IN THE WORLD. 

1227
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:27,550
716MILLION. 

1228
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,485
GREATEST POWER IN THE WORLD. 

1229
00:56:29,485 --> 00:56:32,221
BUT WE'RE DOING GREAT. 

1230
00:56:32,221 --> 00:56:34,891
AND WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE 

1231
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:41,664
CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND OPENED 

1232
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,266
THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN 

1233
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:43,566
JERUSALEM. 

1234
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,700
THAT'S THE OTHER STORY. 

1235
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,703
THAT'S THE OTHER STORY WE TELL. 

1236
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:48,137
THAT'S A BIG ONE. 

1237
00:56:48,137 --> 00:56:50,973
THAT'S A BIG, BIG STORY. 

1238
00:56:50,973 --> 00:56:51,441
YOU KNOW WHY? 

1239
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:53,143
BECAUSE, OTHER PRESIDENTS ALL 

1240
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:53,776
SAID, MANY, MANY PRESIDENTS. 

1241
00:56:53,776 --> 00:56:55,078
WE'LL DO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO 

1242
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:55,244
DO. 

1243
00:56:55,244 --> 00:56:56,546
THEN THE PRESSURE IS ON AND 

1244
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:58,213
THEY DON'T DO IT. 

1245
00:56:58,213 --> 00:56:58,948
I SEE WHY. 

1246
00:56:58,948 --> 00:56:59,749
I DON'T BLAME THEM. 

1247
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,716
THEY SAY DON'T DO IT. 

1248
00:57:00,716 --> 00:57:03,586
PLEASE DON'T DO IT. 

1249
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:09,959
DON'T DO IT. 

1250
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:10,493
YOU KNOW THE STORY. 

1251
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:13,162
TELL THEM I'LL CALL THEM BACK 

1252
00:57:13,162 --> 00:57:13,462
THURSDAY. 

1253
00:57:13,462 --> 00:57:13,962
NEXT WEEK, WEDNESDAY. 

1254
00:57:13,962 --> 00:57:15,365
TELL THEM I'M CALLING THEM BACK 

1255
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:15,765
ON THURSDAY. 

1256
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,134
I LOOK FORWARD TO SPEAKING WITH 

1257
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:18,334
THEM. 

1258
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:19,135
THEN I SIGN THE DEAL. 

1259
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,538
THEN I CALL THEM BACK. 

1260
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:22,204
HI, HOW YOU DOING? 

1261
00:57:22,204 --> 00:57:22,504
WHAT'S UP? 

1262
00:57:22,504 --> 00:57:22,705
WOW. 

1263
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:29,512
WE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT 

1264
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:29,879
ISRAEL. 

1265
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:30,813
BUT IT'S A LITTLE LATE. 

1266
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:34,651
AND THE OTHER THING THAT WAS 

1267
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,886
GOING TO CAUSE OVER A BILLION 

1268
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:42,992
DOLLARS, WE BUILT IT FOR ABOUT 

1269
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,661
400,000. 

1270
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:50,867
IT WOULDWE TOOK A PIECE OF LAND 

1271
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:51,401
WE ALREADY OWN. 

1272
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:57,273
WE FIXED THE BUILDING UP A 

1273
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:57,606
LITTLE MORE. 

1274
00:57:57,606 --> 00:57:59,342
WE USED EVEN JERUSALEM STONE. 

1275
00:57:59,342 --> 00:57:59,976
IT IS BEAUTIFUL. 

1276
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,779
HOW NICE IS THAT? 

1277
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:03,980
AND YOU KNOW, JERUSALEM STONE 

1278
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,014
IN JERUSALEM SOUNDS ABOUT 

1279
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,783
RIGHT. 

1280
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,351
AND WE GOT IT FOR THE RIGHT 

1281
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:08,584
PRICE. 

1282
00:58:08,584 --> 00:58:12,488
AND WE BUILT IT FOR LESS THAN 

1283
00:58:12,488 --> 00:58:12,755
$500,000. 

1284
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:13,489
THINK OF THAT. 

1285
00:58:13,489 --> 00:58:14,757
AND IT'S OPEN NOW. 

1286
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:15,457
WE HAVE OUR EMBASSY. 

1287
00:58:15,457 --> 00:58:21,364
SO WE SAVED A BILLION DOLLARS 

1288
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:22,165
IN 20 YEARS. 

1289
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:26,002
WE COULD DO THAT WITH HUNDREDS 

1290
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:26,269
OF THEM. 

1291
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,772
FOR YEARS, YOU WATCHED AS YOUR 

1292
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:30,672
LEADERS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. 

1293
00:58:30,672 --> 00:58:32,775
AND NOW, YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT 

1294
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:42,785
WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA. 

1295
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:48,791
WE'RE STANDING UP FOR YOUR 

1296
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:49,792
VALUES. 

1297
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:51,393
WE'RE STANDING UP FOR KANSAS. 

1298
00:58:51,393 --> 00:58:55,131
WE'RE STANDING PROUDLY FOR OUR 

1299
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:57,166
GREAT NATIONAL ANTHEM. 

1300
00:58:57,166 --> 00:59:08,811
RIGHT? 

1301
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:10,380
AND I JUST HOPE CANADA AND THE 

1302
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,414
NFL MAKE THE DEAL THEY HAVE 

1303
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:14,216
BEEN TRYING TO MAKE FOR YEARS. 

1304
00:59:14,216 --> 00:59:18,788
CANADA WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF 

1305
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:19,188
THE NFL. 

1306
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:20,590
IT TOOK ME TWO SECOND. 

1307
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:23,593
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY, BUT NOT 

1308
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:25,128
COMPARED TO CORN AND CROPS AND 

1309
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:28,231
DAIRY AND MILK AND CARS AND 

1310
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:28,998
STEEL AND EVERYTHING ELSE. 

1311
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:29,332
IT'S PEANUTS. 

1312
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:31,367
YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF IT. 

1313
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:32,969
BECAUSE I WANT TO HELP AMERICAN 

1314
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:34,871
COMPANIES. 

1315
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:37,073
IT TOOK ME LIKE TWO MINUTES. 

1316
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,408
AND I GOT A CALL FROM THE 

1317
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,510
COMMISSIONER OF THE NFL AND I 

1318
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,746
THOUGHT HE WAS CALLING ME TO 

1319
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:47,183
ASK ME TO STOP HAUNTING THEM 

1320
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:48,117
ABOUT STANDING FOR THE AMERICAN 

1321
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:51,153
FLAG AND FOR OUR NATION. 

1322
00:59:51,153 --> 00:59:51,854
AND HE DIDN'T. 

1323
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:54,190
HE CALLED ME TO THANK ME. 

1324
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:56,759
HE SAID THE PREVIOUS 

1325
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,528
ADMINISTRATION COULD NOT GET 

1326
00:59:58,528 --> 00:59:58,761
INDONE. 

1327
00:59:58,761 --> 00:59:59,695
YOU GOT IT DONE. 

1328
00:59:59,695 --> 01:00:02,632
WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE 

1329
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:06,969
TRYING TO DO IT. 

1330
01:00:06,969 --> 01:00:08,838
SO NOW THEY'LL HAVE A LOT MORE 

1331
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:10,539
MONEY TO GIVE TO THEIR PLAYERS 

1332
01:00:10,539 --> 01:00:14,777
AND THEIR PLAYERS WILL STILL 

1333
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:15,110
HATE ME. 

1334
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:15,511
BUT THAT'S OKAY. 

1335
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:17,847
JUST AS LONG AS THEY STAND FOR 

1336
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:18,114
OUR FLAG. 

1337
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:18,481
AND OUR ANTHEM. 

1338
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:20,983
I DON'T CARE HOW THEY FEEL 

1339
01:00:20,983 --> 01:00:25,888
ABOUT IT. 

1340
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:30,860
BUT, TO CONTINUE OUR INCREDIBLE 

1341
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,227
MOMENT. 

1342
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:34,631
YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR FRIENDS, 

1343
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:38,534
YOUR FAMILY, YOUR COWORKERS, 

1344
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:42,772
GET OUT AND VOTE REPUBLICAN. 

1345
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:45,908
WE NEED MORE PEOPLE. 

1346
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:47,844
VOTE TO SEND KRIS KOBACH TO THE 

1347
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:51,481
GOVERNOR'S MANSION AND VOTE TO 

1348
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:56,753
SEND STEVE WATKINS TO CONGRESS. 

1349
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:57,253
ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN. 

1350
01:00:57,253 --> 01:01:00,289
A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A 

1351
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,692
VOTE FOR LOWER TAXES. 

1352
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:03,092
LESS REGULATION. 

1353
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:04,393
AND MORE PRODUCTS MADE RIGHT 

1354
01:01:04,393 --> 01:01:09,798
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. 

1355
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:10,900
FINALLY. 

1356
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:11,167
FINALLY. 

1357
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,101
WE WANT IT MADE HERE. 

1358
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:14,603
IT'S A VOTE TO RESPECT OUR 

1359
01:01:14,603 --> 01:01:16,639
BORDERS AND RESPECT OUR 

1360
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,474
CONSTITUTION AND RESPECT THE 

1361
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:19,776
HEROS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. 

1362
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:22,879
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE. 

1363
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:27,250
THEY'RE OUR HEROS. 

1364
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:32,755
AND A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS 

1365
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:34,791
TO REJECT THE DEMOCRAT POLITICS 

1366
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:38,761
OF ANGER AND DIVISION AND 

1367
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:39,695
DISRUPTION AND RECLAIM 

1368
01:01:39,695 --> 01:01:41,497
AMERICA'S TRUE HERITAGE AND 

1369
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:41,930
RIGHTEOUS DESTINY. 

1370
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:44,367
WE'RE LOSING THAT WITH THESE 

1371
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,701
CRAZY LOCO PEOPLE. 

1372
01:01:45,701 --> 01:01:47,270
TO EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM 

1373
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:47,670
TONIGHT. 

1374
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:50,806
THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. 

1375
01:01:50,806 --> 01:01:51,974
TO EVERY CITIZEN WATCHING 

1376
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:52,475
ACROSS OUR LAND. 

1377
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:55,511
THIS IS YOUR TIME TO CHOOSE. 

1378
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:56,946
IT'S A TIME TO CHOOSE WHETHER 

1379
01:01:56,946 --> 01:02:00,249
WE TURN BACKWARD TO THE FAILURE 

1380
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:02,485
AND FRUSTRATION OF THE PAST. 

1381
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,120
OR WHETHER WE CONTINUE FORWARD 

1382
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:13,095
INTO A FUTURE OF AMERICAN 

1383
01:02:13,095 --> 01:02:13,796
GREATNESS. 

1384
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:14,763
IT'S NOT UP TO THE MEDIA. 

1385
01:02:14,763 --> 01:02:18,567
IT'S NOT UP TO THE PUN DIDN'TS. 

1386
01:02:18,567 --> 01:02:28,878
IT'S UP TO YOU TO DECIDE YOUR 

1387
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:29,111
FAITH. 

1388
01:02:29,111 --> 01:02:29,545
AND REMEMBER THIS. 

1389
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:30,480
WHAT HAPPENED IN 2016 AND 

1390
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,585
WHAT'S HAPPENING EVEN MORE SO 

1391
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:36,252
NOW I BELIEVE. 

1392
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,354
ONE OF THEM SAID HE MADE A LOT 

1393
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:42,792
OF PROMISES AND HE ACTUALLY 

1394
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:49,165
PRODUCED MORE THAN HE MADE 

1395
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:51,400
PROMISES. I 

1396
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:51,600
DID. 

1397
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,470
YOU HAVE THE POWER WITH YOUR 

1398
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,472
VOTE TO DEFEND YOUR FAMILY, 

1399
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:58,673
YOUR COMMUNITY, YOUR COUNTRY. 

1400
01:02:58,673 --> 01:03:01,277
AND EVERYTHING WE HOLD SACRED 

1401
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:01,877
AND RIGHTEOUS AND TRUE. 

1402
01:03:01,877 --> 01:03:04,280
LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELP 

1403
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,314
BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND 

1404
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:08,751
TOGETHER, WE ARE TAKING BACK 

1405
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:09,085
OUR COUNTRY. 

1406
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:14,757
RETURNING POWER TO EVERY DAY 

1407
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:19,395
GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOTS. 

1408
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:24,200
THE STATE OF KANSAS WAS SETTLED 

1409
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,602
BY TOUGH PIONEER MEN. 

1410
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:27,002
AND STRONG WOMEN. 

1411
01:03:27,002 --> 01:03:29,405
WHO DEFIED DANGER AND BRAVED 

1412
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:32,775
THE WILDERNESS TO BUILD A 

1413
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:38,881
BEAUTIFUL LIFE ON THE PLAINS. 

1414
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:39,181
BEAUTIFUL. 

1415
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:40,283
BEAUTIFUL. 

1416
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:40,583
BEAUTIFUL. 

1417
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:45,888
STRONG WOMEN. 

1418
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:46,889
STRONG WOMEN. 

1419
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:51,194
STRONG WOMEN. 

1420
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:54,897
I'M SORRY FELLOWS. 

1421
01:03:54,897 --> 01:04:00,936
STRONGER THAN THE MEN. 

1422
01:04:00,936 --> 01:04:01,370
I'M SORRY FELLOWS. 

1423
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,672
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 

1424
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:02,905
MONEY. 

1425
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:04,407
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 

1426
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:04,740
LUXURY. 

1427
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:09,011
BUT THEY ALL HAD ONE THING IN 

1428
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:09,244
COMMON. 

1429
01:04:09,244 --> 01:04:11,179
THEY LOVE THEIR FAMILIES. 

1430
01:04:11,179 --> 01:04:14,382
THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRY. 

1431
01:04:14,382 --> 01:04:30,533
AND THEY LOVED THEIR GOD. 

1432
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,867
THESE COURAGEOUS PATRIOTS DID 

1433
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:33,803
NOT SHED THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT, 

1434
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:35,137
AND TEARS SO WE COULD SIT AT 

1435
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:37,306
HOME WHILE OTHERS TRY TO ERASE 

1436
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:40,943
THEIR LEGACY AND DESTROY THEIR 

1437
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:42,011
