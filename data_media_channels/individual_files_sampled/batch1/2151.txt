there's one problem facing America the politicians actually agree on we're a trillion or two trillion dollars short in terms of necessary infrastructure repair we have airports that are obsolete we have the worst transportation system and train system we are living off the investments and the hard work of our parents and our grandparents and when that infrastructure fails the costs can be staggered 35w bridge is at the water a levee break the size of a football field is slowly flooding New Orleans and there's the cost of delay you're not attracting jobs you're not getting to school to the movies to the restaurant once we were the model for the world now we're falling well behind I mean have you ever heard of a levee breaking in the Netherlands so I wanted to know why it keeps happening here or why our commutes take so long for why my flights always delayed or why it takes a freight train a day to move across Chicago we have a fight on our hands we're competing with other countries that are taking our business how do we become the united states of disrepair and can we fix it California's Central Valley it's hot it's dry so why are we in Sacramento talking about floods well half a million people live here at the intersection of two rivers in the city is seven rainy days away from ruin what would the worst case scenario look like for the urban area of Sacramento we could be having casualties equivalent to that New Orleans it could be a thousand five thousand lives lost the damage totals economic losses be catastrophic in the billions of dollars civil engineer Mike Mears was among many national experts who say Sacramento could be the next Katrina if it's flood protection fails the main thing protecting the city these levees you might not even realize that's what you're looking at right now some of them were in great shape but not all the linchpin and that's what makes them so important most of us don't think about water danger in our daily lives but chances are you live in a county protected by a levee 156 million Americans do and those levees could be the only thing between you and a wall of water climate change and rising sea levels have brought a wave of destruction and our water protection systems aren't always up to the task in the case of a flood event this could be one of the danger areas for all of Sacramento at the Sacramento River winds its way around the city it pushes right up against this aging levee here and this levee is protecting a huge residential area called the pocket by building the levee and reducing the risk to what's out there now other people will move in to that levee protected area and so the risk in that area actually increases to help combat the problem miRs WA wants to shore up the Sacramento we're a barrier intended to divert and slow water flow when the water gets high enough on the river it'll begin to overtop the weir and move down a bypass system so it's saving $500 in people's lives by allowing the levees to function better but it's a 100-year old system so 100-year old system that's right definitely in need of a rehabilitation which brings us to the next problem California's levee maintenance only gets thirty million dollars of funding per year if we want to maintain the system to what it is designed to be at it would take a hundred and thirty million dollars per year for just sixteen hundred miles of levees so four times more than the budget allocation is currently that's right America used to invest in itself the Tennessee Valley Authority of the 1930s tamed our rivers the Transcontinental Railroad of the 1800s and the interstate system of the 1950s connected the nation and Unleashed our economies true potential now not so much Europe Asia everybody is in five ten percent of their GDP they're investing in infrastructure we're at less than two and politicians across the spectrum agree on its importance we need to invest more in infrastructure our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports our water systems we will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet Earth the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow politicians and voters alike used to agree on the necessity of funding these types of projects so what changed President Obama says it comes down to philosophical differences between the parties because of an ideology that says government spending is necessarily bad that mindset has led to us not investing in those things that we have to do together Harvard Business School's Roosevelt Moss Kanter has become a leading voice on this topic says these divisions have become systemic the people pushing are in silos rail pushes for rail air has a whole agenda the auto manufacturers have their agenda we don't always put that together and until we have national leadership that understands how to bring them together convene one grand conversation we're not going to really make progress so we've seen why water protection fails in this country it's often overlooked underfunded and misunderstood but why are my flights delayed my commute so long or our trains so slow well it turns out Chicago answers all three so I set out for the Windy City it didn't take long to get stuck we are currently driving any so-called express lane on the i-90 four and we are moving at zero miles an hour now we are stopped in an express lane which is somewhat par for the course for Chicago because this highway right here is the most congested highway in America we actually spend way more per year on highways than any other form of infrastructure investment but our roads are still in a consistent state of disrepair the state of roads in Illinois right now is - projected to get down to a sixty percent state of good repair in the next five years so sixty percent of the roads will be in good state of good repair that means 40 percent won't that's an unacceptable statistic that story repeats itself across the country one-third of America's major roads are in poor or mediocre condition somewhat counter-intuitively we don't necessarily need to build more roads increasing capacity often leads to greater congestion not less it's often the least sexy stuff that matters most there's potholes there's congestion so that really becomes our first and foremost primary mission critical is to fix what we have if you are doing maintenance correctly nobody notices that's not something that politicians like they like to get noticed that's the case with our bridges - one in nine of them are structurally deficient meaning they require significant maintenance rehabilitation or replacement congested crumbling roads and bridges hit your wallet at the pump at the mechanic and at the store - trucks move 2/3 of our Freight in this country and when they can't move around costs get passed on to the consumer everything is dependent upon this infrastructure that operates in the background when it works well but when it starts to fail people will notice that so if we spend more on highways than anything else and it's still nowhere near enough to even maintain what we have imagine how far behind we are elsewhere in this country more people travel by air than anywhere else by far I'm one of them I've flown dozens of times in the last couple of years and my flights are delayed at least half the time why because many of our airports most built decades ago operate beyond their design capacity many experts estimate that the United States economy loses somewhere between 22 and 30 billion dollars a year in lost economic output due to flight delays and cancellations one of the biggest culprits is this Airport right here Chicago O'Hare International every time you come through this Airport on average you're adding 34 minutes travel time round-trip and O'Hare isn't even the biggest offender all three New York airports are worse and LaGuardia takes the cake adding an average of 56 minutes to every round-trip on the other side of the world this is what Airport investments look like Singapore's Changi Airport is considered the best in the world look at its spacious terminals indoor rainforest art installations smooth operation Tokyo's Haneda is a gleaming Cathedral and as on-time departures are tops in the world greater than 90% so what's standing between us and this for one we need to replace the FAA s radar based flight systems with satellites faster safer routing and decreased gaps between plane takeoffs and landings that's in the works now but only if Congress funds not cuts the FAA s budget Changi and Haneda also benefit from coordinated federal and private funding but here airports are owned and operated by a hodgepodge of local county and state groups and our airports can't raise passenger fees for improvements above a meager federal cap set more than a decade ago another reason why US airports are overburdened a lack of comparable options if we did more to have rail be a great alternative the way it is in Europe or the way it is in Japan then not many people would be flying we do have high speed rail in this country the fastest is the Acela Express in the Northeast Corridor due to track issues it can only reach a top speed of 150 miles an hour in two short locations along its route meanwhile maglev trains in Japan and China reached top speeds in excess of 250 miles an hour this is a major reason why we can't achieve that here look at these six lines of track running directly across one another shared by freight commuter and Amtrak alike it's the infamous 75th Street corridor it really is the Gordian knot in Chicago that needs to be untangled it would be like two major interstates meeting each other at a four-way stop sign it really is impactful on the entire nation in terms of moving traffic through when various lines share track as is true on the Acela in the Northeast it slows everyone to a standstill this matters because 40% of ton miles traveled by Freight in this country goes by rail that's your food your cars your packages and the third of it goes through Chicago there's no other mode of transportation where a third of something goes anywhere you can do everything right everywhere else from from sea to shining sea on our network and Chicago is the goal line and you can't fumble on the goal line in many cases it takes 48 hours to move rail freight from LA to Chicago and a day just to move it across the city six of the seven major railroads in this country connect in the city the only place that happens so to start untangling this mess the rail companies working with Amtrak the city of Chicago the state of Illinois and the Department of Transportation want to build a flyover that would separate the north-south and east-west tracks from one another we get support letters from Houston Seattle Tacoma it's not a local neighborhood job it's one of global significance to avoid getting stuck in transit I order a lot of things online I'm sure many of you do too and if you shift it by UPS it's likely your package went through this rail yard CSX is bed park it's the busiest yard in the city and it underscores how many big complex things have to go right before your orders get to you what are we looking at right here what's what's what's going on right now right now they are lining up our train going to Kearny New Jersey this train will go out about 10,000 feet tonight and it'll have carry close to 300 boxes on this train the yard measures how busy it is by lips' loading a container onto or taking a container off a train how many lifts will this facility do this year I think we're going to do close to 950 thousand nine hundred and fifty thousand container lifts in this one yard so when freight trains are held up at intersections like the 75th Street corridor huge operations like this can't run smoothly for all these issues it all comes down to a collective failure of leadership if public and private interests politicians and voters can unite to fix our crumbling infrastructure the payoffs could be huge from better global competitiveness to world-class travel experiences what do you see as the future vision of what the infrastructure system in this country is going to look like in 20 30 40 years from now I think it'll be things that use technology are much more integrated in multimodal where you'll be able to connect from one form to another fairly seamlessly will have walkable cities that feel human while all this technology makes it easier for us the rise of Technology and big data are breaking through new frontiers that we never even dreamed possible ten years ago but those will mean nothing if the fundamental system is not maintained and repaired this is a connected system and we should see it that way and we should think about leading our leaders to do more about it I really hope that the millennial generation will take this on and start imagining the way things could be and then push
