EVIDENCE ABOUT IRAN LYING ABOUT

00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,093
THE NUCLEAR DEAL, IF YOU HAD THE

13
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:28,828
DECISION OF A U.S. SENATOR,

14
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,162
WOULD YOU VOTE TO END THAT

15
00:00:30,162 --> 00:00:30,896
DEALER DO YOU THINK IT’S WISER

16
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:34,700
TO CONTINUE IT?

17
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,435

TENNESSEE AND WEST VIRGINIA.

IT’S COUNTRY ROADS HERE, FOLKS.

>> Martha: DULY NOTED.

23
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:47,980
DULY NOTED.

24
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,482
>> WE ARE PROUD WEST VIRGINIANS.

25
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:50,984
WE GET PUT DOWN SO MANY TIMES,

00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:54,854
PEOPLE MAKE FUN OF US, SO THAT’S

27
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,890
WHAT MY CANDIDACY, WHAT MY LIFE

28
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,357
HAS BEEN ABOUT.

29
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,157
STANDING UP FOR WHO WE ARE AND

00:00:58,157 --> 00:01:00,326
WHAT WE BELIEVE.

31
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,729
SORRY TO JUMP IN.

32
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,363
IT’S ABOUT WEST VIRGINIA.

33
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,732
IT’S WEST VIRGINIA BRIDE.

34
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,468
>> Martha: WHAT ABOUT IRAN?

35
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:11,237
>> THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL WAS A

36
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,105
DISASTER.

37
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,507
THE IDEA THAT WE CUT PALLETS OF

38
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,409
CASH BEING SHIPPED TO IRAN.

39
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,544
BARACK OBAMA MADE A DISASTER IS

40
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:17,844
DEAL.

41
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:21,915
WE’VE GOT A DEADLINE COMING UP.

42
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:22,983
DONALD TRUMP SHOULD END THE IRAN

43
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:23,283
DEAL.

44
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,452
>> Martha: EVEN THOUGH THE

45
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:26,620
LEADERSHIP IN IRAN HAS SAID THAT

46
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,088
THEY WOULD INSTANTLY RESTART

47
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:28,789
THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM IF THE

48
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,523
DEAL WERE ENDED, YOU ARE OKAY

49
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:32,092
WITH THAT?

50
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,227
>> I RESPECT THE STATE OF

51
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:34,561
ISRAEL.

52
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,263
I HAVE BEEN WITH

53
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,132
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IN JERUSALEM.

54
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,869
I UNDERSTAND THE FORCES OF EVIL

55
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,904
THAT ARE ALL AROUND JERUSALEM.

56
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,739
THE STATE OF ISRAEL IS

57
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:46,306
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL.

58
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,275
WHICH SUPPORT THEM, WE DEFEND

59
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:48,909
THEM.

60
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,911
THE IDEA THAT IRAN AND THEIR

61
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,246
NUCLEAR PROGRAM, IT WAS A

62
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:53,814
TERRIBLE DEAL, IT NEEDS TO BE

63
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:54,114
ENDED.

64
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,449
WE NEED TO GO BACK AND NEGOTIATE

65
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,417
A BETTER DEAL THAT WILL PROTECT

66
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:59,320
THE WORLD.

67
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,287
>> Bret: PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

68
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,223
TALKED ABOUT GETTING U.S. TROOPS

69
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:03,124
OUT OF SYRIA.

70
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,925
HE ALSO, AFTER MEETING WITH THE

71
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,728
FRENCH PRESIDENT MACRON TALKED

72
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:08,496
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY FOR HAVING

73
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,631
THEM STAY FOR SOME TIME.

74
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,232
WHAT’S THE RIGHT CHOICE?

75
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:14,302
>> I DON’T THINK ANYBODY UP YOUR

76
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:15,903
NOSE WITH THE RIGHT CHOICES.

77
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:17,071
I DON’T AGREE WITH GOING AROUND

78
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:18,906
THE WORLD AND PUTTING OURSELVES

79
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:19,640
IN HARM’S WAY WHEN ENEMIES ARE

80
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,242
FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER.

81
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,911
BUT BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

82
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:24,712
ENERGY, THERE IS 19,000 OF THEM,

83
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:26,147
OR SOMEBODY TOLD ME.

84
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:26,848
I NEVER MET ONE.

85
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:29,117
I PRODUCED MORE ENERGY THAN

86
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:30,184
ANYONE IN THE HISTORY OF THIS

87
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,653
AREA SO IT DOESN’T MAKE ANY

88
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:32,120
SENSE.

89
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,488
I WOULD BE FOR CUTTING THE

90
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:34,622
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TO ABOUT

91
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:38,326
200 PEOPLE AND GETTING RID OF

92
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,127
ABOUT 18,800.

93
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:40,462
>> Bret: NUMBER ONE THREAT

94
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:42,697
FACING THE U.S.?

95
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:45,100
>> I THINK WE HAVE TO GO BACK

96
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,101
AND LOOK.

97
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:46,768
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS VERY

98
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:48,603
ADROITLY HANDLED ISIS AND I

99
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:50,705
THINK WHAT’S GOING ON IN THE

100
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:52,340
MIDDLE EAST REMAINS A POWDER

101
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:52,607
KEG.

102
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:54,876
BUT NORTH KOREA, I STILL AM VERY

103
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:55,610
DISTRUSTFUL OF WHAT’S GOING ON

104
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,179
BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND

105
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:57,579
SOUTH KOREA.

106
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:00,282
I COMMEND THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE

107
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:01,283
HIS TOUGH TALK HAS ACTUALLY

108
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:03,118
GOTTEN THIS TO A PLACE, PERHAPS,

109
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:05,253
UNDER THIS PRESIDENT WE ARE NOT

110
00:03:05,253 --> 00:00:00,000
GOING TO HAVE A REPEAT OF THE
