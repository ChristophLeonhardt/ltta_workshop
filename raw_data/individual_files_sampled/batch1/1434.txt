mining has always been part of South Africa's rich economic history but the sector is now shrinking companies are planning to cut thousands of jobs even as many struggle to find work so what impact will it have this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Mohammed Jim Jim South Africa has some of the world's biggest reserves of platinum gold iron ore and coal but mining now makes up less than 7 percent of its economic output a steep fall from 20% in the 1970s companies are blaming low prices and soaring production costs for the decline mining is also intertwined with race relations the people who work deep underground and often dangerous conditions are overwhelmingly black while the executives overseeing them are mainly white some of the firms have pushed back against government plans to make them bring back more black shareholders we'll bring in our guests in a moment but first femida Miller reports from rustenberg from the depths of this mine comes one of the world's most valuable metals despite the value of platinum above ground at the Impala mine in rustenberg many workers live in poor conditions but Impala platinum says productivity and profits are down and it now has to restructure its operations it plans to slash about a third of its workforce thus miner who doesn't want to be identified says while working conditions are often difficult miners are desperate to save their jobs it's rare form for our management to come the underground didn't see the challenges they were facing as an employees day so under the guard of asthma producing actually I think it's an excuse the concerns they always did we can apply for us to or for the shaft actually to go higher on production and stuff in parlor platinum declined al-jazeera's request for an interview but released a statement saying the cutbacks would be done responsibly and it would try to save as many jobs as possible mining in the rustenberg area makes up at least 70 percent of economic activity with mines employing at least half of the people working here three of the largest ones have spent tens of millions of dollars on education health and local housing programs so a decline in production would mean more than just job losses for thousands of people this is where six years ago thousands of mine workers at the neighboring Lonmin mine went on strike demanding higher paid and better living conditions police opened fire on the crowd killing 34 miners and injuring 78 others the wounds of that day are still war in this community the sense of the volatility and what this could be leading to was already given in January and February where there were protests within within within rustenberg these took his own a phobic form but they were clearly to do with with the growing sort of social desperation which is coming with the downturn in the platinum mining industry there while most of South Africa's conventional platinum mines like Impala Platinum are losing money further job cuts are not easy to swallow in a country where the unemployment rate has risen to just over 27% workers union AAMCO says it won't accept the job cuts and is considering mass action the concern for many is that the job cuts could further escalate simmering labour and social unrest femida mela al jazeera Rustenburg northwest province all right let's bring in our panel who are joining us from Johannesburg LeBeau hyung Paco is a senior research fellow at trade collective a non profit organization promoting social justice Millette kopaka Dee is the deputy general secretary of the South African Federation of trade unions and Ralph motika is a researcher and lecturer at the University of the Western Cape welcome to you all Ralph let me start with you why are these job cuts and cutbacks necessary what is the rationale behind them well I think that first of all there is pressure when it comes to the price of commodities and mining companies are feeling a great deal of pressure they're off so they cannot carry on as they see it with maintaining their jobs within that sector but I also think there is another sector as well because one who say that day at least they should be willingness on the side of mining companies to stay of this not to react in the manner in which they are doing to wait for maybe recovery of Christ within commodities but the biggest problem as well which makes it difficult for them to have a positive outlook it is just a very uncertain policy environment where they believe that government seems not to be clear when it comes to policies and if you look at South Africa now policy discourse it is very very tense and I think that we have a very tense conflict within the policy environment and that is the reason why mining companies prefer to cut and run instead of waiting of this because they do not see any positive outlook in a medium-term LeBeau hung the wealth gap in the country continues to widen are there measures that the government is taking to help to close that gap there are a few things the one is a national minimum wage which has been discussed over the last couple of years and has finally been poured into you know put in place I mean that's supposed to exactly do that to decrease the inequalities of wages and also increase the inequality no class inequalities I think another thing that's quite important though is that we come from you know a structural legacy of inequality a structural legacy of wage inequality and end poverty and comes from spacial a lack of spatial democracy where people travel huge long distances to get to work and so a huge amount of their savings is expended on transport the second is that our our coal industry and a lot of our our our capital our industries are capital intensive including coal which is not sustainable so we know we need to think about low-carbon in 10 sectors and and also the third thing would be that our sense of spatial geography means that the migration from rural to urban areas has resulted in a really four lon agricultural agricultural economic landscape which is racially skewed and which has also meant that a lot of people don't see agriculture as a sunrise sector and as one that is viable and yet that is one that is extremely viable and that we need to like look at in order to democratize the opportunity for jobs between urban and rural areas and of course between and with it and within racial groups malleco it looked to me as though you were nodding to what level hung was saying did you want to add to what she was talking about a part of I agree but the greater part laundry the reality is that the South African mining industry have strived on the backbone of true one being the migrant labor system three being low paid workers thirdly be the issue of who in condition to else standard you would appreciate the fact that workers are rising up to allow businesses to demand better wages will appreciate that there is an introduction of the national minimum wage despite the fact that you are opposed to it it cannot necessarily be an issue that the miners are bringing up that there now cost of mining is such that they cannot be able to keep that amount of workers I think is just sheer arrogance they have headed the easy way is the sheer greed so to say they want to continue to amass profit at all cost the reality of the issues that industries have been changing and they need to be some form of changes including the lives of workers in their own Ami's our economy has relied on two aspect one being Miami the second being aquaculture so it cannot be correct that therefore mines will just run to cut drop purely because of market fluctuations ralphe government officials there have been calling for dialogue with the mining sector they've been calling for this dialogue repeatedly I mean has that actually happened has it started well the problem is that government officials political leaders in South Africa they have actually lost legitimacy to mediate this dialogue the problem is that whenever they ask the trade unions to moderate on the waste demand with the aim to grow the economy trade unions have got a valid case to make against government to say that day wait a minute you actually have got no leg to stand on you have not implemented policy you have been marred by corruption and actually you are acting in the interest of the mining process this is one of the reasons why if you look at the standoff in the mining sector the strikes are becoming quite Lona government has lost that moral ground actually to rally everyone around and to say that let us find amicable ways in which to deal with this and in a situation such as this in a situation where government lack that moral legitimacy to mediate the tension between the mining bosses that is the employers and the trade unions you end up with a direct confrontation between mining bosses and and and the trade unions it is a very unhealthy environment it has a lot to do with government's inability to assume this moral high ground and say that we are acting in the interest of the broader society as we speak it becomes very suspicious when government comes to and say to the trade union that they should moderate their demand and also in South Africa as well government has not been able to manage its relationship with the private sector very well that is why trade unions are very suspicious as I speak now I think South Africa's trade unions are becoming more and more impatient they become more and more radicalized there are more and more willing to walk away from the table because they don't believe that government act in the interest of everyone that is a moral problem that we have Monica what do you think about the prospect of government mediation or moderation I mean is there hope that something like this can succeed or as ralph was saying has the government really giving up any kind of moral high ground on this issue I think government is just blowing hot air the fact of the matter is that it is taking sides when you going back into your memory and you remember that today is one of the critical days that workers in South Africa will never forget in this is as a result of the commemoration of the lives of workers that were lost during the Americana man waka struggle the issue is simple the issue as a matter between employers employees who are in workers were demanding a decent wage a 12,500 to be exact but the intervention by government through state and it's apparatus was quite biased was in the interest of ensuring that the employers as in this case mining companies which for obvious reasons they seems to be part of will continue to oppress workers and people wages government is not necessarily taking a firm stance when it goes about intervening within the crisis you have in the labor market and we don't believe that they have got the capabilities to do so within policy tragically that they have they are driving you cannot have sitting just what exit is that they want to achieve Laveau hung because melaka brought up Marikana i mean it is striking that this discussion is really intensifying you know this particular week you know six years on the families of the Maracana 34 still haven't gotten justice or compensation why is that yeah it's a lot of that's a very good question I mean the one reason would be political will and just a really sluggish a sluggish sense of obligation and I think that's to do with the really combative and slightly parochial attitude that the state has towards workers but the state has exhibited towards trade unions and at the status quo has also exhibited towards the widows and and and the broader community that have been impacted by the Marikana Massacre I think secondly it's also to do with a really at this engagement with the fact that the economy is changing and shifting it is shifting not only geographically it is also shifting in terms of the way that the economy happens so geographically jobs are moving to different places which i think is a horrible a horrible model because this suggests that companies and industry continues to go-go-go rent-seeking across the world in search of the lowest form of wages low to cheapest cheapest form of wages which also mean the cheapest form of arm working conditions I think thirdly aligned to that is that we have not been intentional in this country about our policy our policy framing as Ralph was saying earlier on so we've got excellent ideas about what needs to be done we know what we need to do we need to we need to close down the spatial geographic lack of democracy in this country we need to also deal with the skills gap we need to have a transitional economy which means that people are multi skilled and able to participate in different parts of the economy we need to do with the climate aspects of our economy because as I said previously it's a labor intensive capital intensive carbon intensive economy which is finite I don't think that fracking is the way to go forward and also we also need to think about our our global our participation in regional value chains I'm not very much in favor of global value chains because obviously those are those are those are determined by different dictates World Trade Organization etc and northern countries which have their own you know policy and trade parameters which are disadvantages to an economy like South Africa we need to not think much more clearly around how we leverage African economics and regional global regional value chains we have done none of the above so we have the National Development Plan where the new growth paths we have the industrial policy plan we have a whole host you know a menu of things that need to be done and we know what needs to be done but the point is when are we actually going to put one policy in place and allow it they let the levity and the longitudinal access to actually happen five to ten years or three to five years is not long enough for some things to actually work effectively Ralph I saw you nodding along rather vigorously to many of the points that LeBeau hung was making there so so I want to ask I mean did you have did you want to add to what she was saying as far as the solutions she was offering up for the economic woes I fully agree with my colleague Delhi Wuhan because it is about the focus of policy and if you look at South Africa's policy and what has happened the policy trajectory in the last 80 so so the policy has actually been appropriated by interest groups who have been able to influence politicians in a manner that resulted in lack of focus so if you if you have if you have that lost opportunity on the side of government to implement policy in a sustained manner to try it out and evaluate the policy and find a way forward if you ever lost that you cannot demonstrate that it becomes very difficult for South Africa to actually react to the global economic challenges that you are having I mean sometimes you listen to South Africa's policy makers and I think there is lack of awareness when it comes to the hostile global economic environment where we are globally multilateralism a globalization is almost failing there is more of unilateralism and bilateralism but multilateralism is dead as we know countries are throwing ultimatums at each other you do have the trade wars that are underway so a country such as South Africa an emerging market coming from this historical legacy of inequality you just cannot waste an opportunity with those self-inflicted problem such as state CAPTCHA such as loss of focus when it comes to police implementation the world is not going to wait for us and the world economy is actually shifting by the time we get this thing right my fear is that someone out there will have found the way to manufacture platinum in a laboratory they will no longer be needing these mines and that would be a lost opportunity we need to understand that the world is not going to wait for us we cannot waste an opportunity welcome to policy focus malleco president cyril ramaphosa you know came into office promising to be a stable and steady hand to advance the economy there in South Africa first of all how do you think he's doing and secondly I mean are the systemic problems in the economy there are they essentially bigger than Rama poza no mom if the surah mufasa's presidency does not excite us we have analyzed this hundred years alessandra days in office pardon me we were not excited even at the time that he was now taking the helm of government we knew that there is nothing that you can expect from the party that he leads the police is that they are driving we knew that the Newton is nothing but just a claw what any false hope and you would appreciate that the working class in South Africa are suffering the motor is other it is even worse under his administration we have been meted with the tax increase of about one percent to be exact seven percent as I met the unemployment rate is increasing profit is not been addressed they mean that the wages have been driven low to be exact you would appreciate that people are losing jobs the current economy does not create any if anything is to go by we are losing jobs you can go into even other sectors you can go into that culture and sector you can go into the public service now which we have been informed about fifty thousand blend blend to a job I mean it is about a plan to do about away with thirty thousand jobs so Cyril Ramaphosa does not give us any glimmer of hope so far as we are concerned however we will never forget the Mattias pose Americana because we believe they were quite clear had they achieved the twelve thousand five hundred they have done one of the two things Mohammed first thing that they would have done they would have broken down a wage structure in South Africa that is in our view based on race gender and a man is from their colonial times apartheid times and is perpetuating they would have brought hope to what South Africans but color ordinary working-class we would have at least seen the first phase of the implementation of the Freedom Charter that's where the issues of police is coming to play you cannot divorce land you cannot divorce labor from mining that rely intertwined and we have to talk to them barring a balanced way such that one does not necessarily get lost in the equation lastly is the issue of mining communities you would appreciate that mining communities have been displaced because certain companies we want to take over such then is merely for purpose of extracting that exporting it and for that matter which I define a finish good there is no reason why South Africa should not be no more nationalizing minor establishes a minor company where we can equal him mine and even beneficiate there is no reason why that's not happening will not behave in the American decision that government being decisive in its own macroeconomic policy system is LeBaron they'd like the big boots operas were cosy LeBeau hung malleco was talking about mining communities was talking about the workforce there so I want to step back for a moment from the facts and figures whom talk about the politics behind all this I want to talk specifically about the human toll in all of this when it comes to these workers that have been laid off how dire are the circumstances for them how are they able to survive are they able to get jobs in the short term or are their communities completely devastated I mean look there's destitution that's involved in this remember that a lot of these communities as I mentioned earlier many people have have come from a situation of structural inequality so there are three layers that we need to deal with the structural which is the historical and and the economic the systemic which is the way that we do what we do and the current the purpose the social political which is you know the kind of policy choices that we can make in the medium to short term to obviate this so one thing that we haven't been able to do is to deal with as I mentioned earlier skills transitioning skills transferring and multi skilling to enable any worker to to take on a job in another sector for transferable skills secondly our social benefits are really shocking many of the workers by the way that are now destitute and their communities according to some of the research that my our think tank has also been conducting also not only from South Africa so this is a regional issue the question of portability of social benefits the portability of firm of funds and retirement annuities and in turn and the portability of basically human dignity is also one that really we have not touched on even though sudda the Southern African Development Corporation does have a protocol on on labor and migration but many in many cases there's such a dissonance between what is what is the in the protocol and the way in which states and nations and governments relate to that protocol and lastly I think that it's also important to note that you know many of these mining companies are not necessarily from this country and there's a debate about whether foreign direct investment and foreign companies are are best placed to produce jobs to produce well-being to build up by mining communities to build up houses education and the things the social amenities that would give community members an enhanced sense of life and an enhanced life choices my opinion is that the state must always have a role to play we cannot allow foreign capital no matter what they'll dress their intentions may be to continuously run roughshod over our local in our local policy and development priorities contaminating the environment disrespecting labor rights and also disrespecting the lives of people once they have discarded them from the workforce so I think that this is very important discourse around what foreign direct investment actually means and how we need to recapitalize our local economy so that it works for us Ralph what about the trade unions there I mean how strong are they now and are they actually able to protect workers I mean as we speak now you do have a new Federation you have software and software is a trade union that has been born out of dissatisfaction with the relationship but Cassatt you affiliated trade unions have had with government they have found that relationship not to be in the interest of the worker so you do have trade unions that are saying that wait a minute we need to redefine the relationship that we have in government trade unions are becoming very wary of having an intimate relationship with government are they protecting the workers I think that the difficulty is that there is just massive job drop cards and they are suffering when it comes to membership of the decline of membership within trade unions I mean you talk to trade unions such as AAMCO as well they have taken a very I mean clear position in relation to government they are not interested in having an intimate relationship with them they are not interested in going into government and I believe this is house off to also understand itself so there is a very serious realignment within the labor sector and I think but something that is even more thing as well is that even trade unions that are related to casado that is close to government I actually trying to build a relationship with trade unions Federation such as South two that are not aligned because they are realizing that the classical alliance that they've had with government it's not improving the condition of where castes or trade units in South Africa I really I think taking the fight fair that they are aligned to civil society organization which I think it is very much interesting they're beginning to try to redefine that labor space but they are confronted with the reality that their declining membership that is the reality that they're dealing with as well all right we have run at a time so we are gonna have to leave it there thanks to all our guests LeBeau hyung Peck oh well Echo Park ad and Ralph motika and thank you too for
