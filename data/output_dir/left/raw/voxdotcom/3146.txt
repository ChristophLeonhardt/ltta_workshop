1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,929
VIKKI: They’re so expressive. You just can’t
believe it.

2
00:00:02,929 --> 00:00:06,800
GK: The primates are so real and so close
to us.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,700
This is G.K. and Vikki Hart. They're the husband
and wife stock photography team behind those great

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,599
office baboons you’ve probably seen online
over the past year.

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,539
Those video clips that, oddly enough, seem
to perfectly illustrate the subtle emotions

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:23,359
of everyday human life.
Like when you’re in a meeting that was called

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,579
in order to plan another meeting.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,240
Or when the recipe calls for ground rose petal and grape molasses.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:42,740
Or when your boss emails to ask if you can work on Saturday.

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,140
The Harts couldn’t have predicted that their

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,000
work would become prime fodder for animated gifs

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,570
because they filmed the baboons 13 years ago. That was before the birth of twitter, tumblr, and reddit.

13
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,040
This is what the internet looked like 13 years
ago

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,480
There were animated gifs back then but they looked
like this.

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,780
The Harts just thought it’d be fun.
VIKKI: We’ve been working with animals for

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,450
ages. GK: And the great thing about the animals
is they’re universal, and so people love them everywhere.

17
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,749
Their images go onto greeting cards, books,
ads. And before the internet found the baboons,

18
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:15,429
they appeared in a Steve Carell movie.

19
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,869
VIKKI: And it’s so funny, we go to the movie
and we sit and watch it and we go 'Oh, it’s

20
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:24,889
our baboons! It's our baboons!' and everyone thinks we’re crazy.

21
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:27,529
"He's eating paper!"

22
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,520
It wasn’t until April 2014 that digital
artist Steph Davidson came across the baboons

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,819
while looking for stock footage and she made a
gif for her tumblr.

24
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:38,899
Then, a year later, the baboons really took
off on twitter.

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,439
The Harts spent about a month preparing for the

26
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,179
shoot. They made special baboon-sized props
like the newspaper

27
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,720
and rigged up the chairs so they could turn them by pulling a wire.

28
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:06,889
The trainers for the 3 baboons involved in
the shoot knew in advance which behaviors

29
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:10,889
they would need, like typing and holding phones.
GK: And then the best stuff was the stuff

30
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,270
that we never expected. And those are always
the fun takes.

31
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,170
The one who ate the paper...that was 100%
baboon improv.

32
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,070
And so was this.

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,960
VIKKI: It was a brand new laptop!

34
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,760
GK: And I still remember looking through camera and thinking

35
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,830
oh no! And i’m so glad I kept the film rolling
or I would have missed the whole thing.

36
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,970
That pile of money was real too.
GK: A few hundred dollars and it was pretty

37
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,170
well torn up by the end of the shoot. So we
have some souvenirs.

38
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,400
The baboon video clips are managed by Getty
but the Harts own the copyright. Still they’re

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,340
refreshingly relaxed about the unlicensed
use of their work.

40
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,940
VIKKI: Sure it would be nice if they made more money but to make people laugh

41
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,600
and for people to take it and use it their own way

42
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,700
-- you just can’t buy that.

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,720
I just wanted to give a shoutout to Melvin Backman. He interviewed the Harts back in September,

44
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,320
which is how I found their names. I also wanted to one of my favorite baboon clips

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,880
which isn't part of the office baboons series, but was filmed by G.K. and Vikki on the same day.

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a baboon in a chef hat.
