Champion.
>> Sandra: WE HAVE A LOT MORE
TO DO AND WE CAN'T RISK LOSING
OUT ON THESE MIDTERMS SO
COMPLACENCY WILL BE OUR ENEMY,
AND ANYONE WHO DOESN'T EMBRACE
THE TRUMP AGENDA AND RECOGNIZED
THE ISSUES THAT PROPELLED US TO
VICTORY IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS
GOING TO BE MAKING A MISTAKE.
>> Sandra: THAT WAS RONNA
McDANIEL, ON OUR SISTER
NETWORK, FOX BUSINESS.
LAST WEEK THOSE COMMENTS SENT
OFF A THEORY OF CRITICISM AND
COME UP HERE TO EXCLUSIVELY
EXPLAIN THOSE WORDS IS RONNA
McDANIEL, CHAIR OF THE
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE.
GOOD EVENING TIO.
>> Ronna: GOOD EVENING, GREAT
TO BE HERE.
AND, IF YOU COULD CLARIFY, AND
IT'S PROBABLY THE LEAST
THREATENING PERSON YOU ARE GOING
TO FIND BUT, IT'S SOMETHING I'M
SEEING AND HEARING AS I TRAVEL
AROUND THE COUNTRY.
I WANT TO SEE OUR CANDIDATES
SUPPORTING OUR PRESIDENT BECAUSE
OUR PRESIDENT SUPPORTS US.
HE'S HELPED USHER IN 3 MILLION
NEW JOBS, RECORD UNEMPLOYMENT.
ISIS IS ON THE RUN, AND YOU ARE
SEEING OUR ECONOMY BOOMING.
THAT'S WHY THEY VOTED TO PUT HIM
IN OFFICE AND THAT'S WHY THEY
WANT TO SEE HIM KEEP THESE
MAJORITIES AND HAVE CANDIDATES
THAT ARE SUPPORTING THE AGENDA.
>> Sandra: IT SO IT IS THAT
THE WINNING STRATEGY HEADING
INTO NOVEMBER TO EMBRACE THE
PRESIDENT AND HIS POLICIES?
>> AND, TO EMBRACE THE POLICIES.
GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN
THIS COUNTRY.
WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE ENTERING THE
WORKFORCE AND VETERANS ARE BEING
TAKEN CARE OF.
LOTS TO RUN ON FOUR REPUBLICANS
AND THESE ARE THINGS THAT
PROPELLED DONALD TRUMP.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ISSUES THAT
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO
AMERICANS AND EVERY REPUBLICAN
SHOULD EMBRACE THAT BECAUSE
THAT'S HOW WE WILL WIN AND KEEP
THE MAJORITY.
>> Sandra: IT SEEMS SOME STILL
ON THE LEFT, DEMOCRATS, ARE
CHOOSING THAT ANTI-       ANTI-R
CHOOSING THAT ANTI-       ANTI-M
CHOOSING THAT ANTI-       ANTI-P
CHOOSING THAT ANTI-       ANTI-M
CHOOSING THAT ANTI-       ANTI-S
CHOOSING THAT ANTI-       ANTI-A
CHOOSING THAT ANTI-       ANTI-E
CHOOSING THAT ANTI-       ANTI-
MESSAGE.
HE ALSO HAPPENS TO BE
GEORGE W. BUSH'S FORMER ETHICS
LAWYER.
HE HAS PUT TOGETHER THIS AD
DEPICTING TRUMP AS A DUMPSTER
FIRE.
WATCH THIS.
>> SOME PEOPLE SEE A DUMPSTER
FIRE AND DO NOTHING BUT WATCH
THE SPECTACLE.
SOME ARE TOO SCARED TO FACE THE
DANGER OR THEY THINK IT WILL
BENEFIT THEM IF THEY LET IT KEEP
ON GOING.
OTHERS SHRUG AND SAY, ALL THIS
FAKE NEWS.
THERE IS AN INFERNO RAGING IN
WASHINGTON.
WE WOULD KNOW HOW TO PUT OUT A
FIRE.
>> Ronna: THEY HAVE FOCUSED ON
THIS REALIST AND STAND UP TO THE
PRESIDENT.
THEY ARE RESISTING BETTER PAY,
AND A STRONGER ECONOMY, SO MANY
GOOD THINGS OR HAVE BEEN AT THIS
COUNTRY, THE DEMOCRATS ARE
REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT.
THEY SHOULD BE EMBRACING THESE
THINGS.
SO ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR THE
PARTY OF NO, RESIST AND OBSTRUCT
OR ARE YOU GOING TO GO TO THE
DEPARTMENT THAT HAS ACTUALLY
DONE THINGS FOR THIS COUNTRY?
WE HAVE SEEN REPUBLICANS TURNING
OUT IN HIGHER NUMBERS AND
DEMOCRATS ON THESE VARIOUS
CURRENT POLICIES IN OHIO AND
NORTH DAKOTA.
BUT BEYOND THAT WE ARE
DELIVERING AND MAKING PEOPLE'S
LIVES BETTER.
>> Sandra: REALLY QUICK I WANT
TO PLAY THIS, CORY STEWART,
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE.
>>  >> THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TIED
OURSELVES TO PRESIDENT TRUMP.
WE ARE GOING TO INCREASINGLY WIN
AS WE GET CLOSER TO NOVEMBER.
I THINK THAT BY THAT POINT WE
WILL HAVE A RED TIDE BECAUSE OF
THE POPULARITY OF
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
>> Sandra: CLEARLY EMBRACING
THE PRESIDENT AND HIS POLICIES,
AND HE HAS WHAT SOME SEE AS
CONTROVERSIAL PAST.
I HADN'T SEEN WHETHER OR NOT THE
RNC IS SUPPORTING HIM AS A
CANDIDATE.
SO OBVIOUSLY, WE SUPPORT THE
NOMINEES OF STATES ACROSS THE
COUNTRY, BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE
IN THE MOST BATTLEGROUND STATES,
THE STATES WHERE WE CAN PICK UP
SENATE SEATS.
WE ALSO ARE LOOKING AT STATES
AND OTHER STATES THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED.
>> SO AS YOUR SUPPORT FORCE CORY
STEWART?
>> WE ARE NOT IN A STATEWIDE FOR
A VIRGINIA OR NEW JERSEY OR
MINNESOTA, WE ARE GOING TO BE
