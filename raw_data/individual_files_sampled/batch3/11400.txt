as thousands of England fans pack their bags for Russia this summer it seems one thing they won't be needing our travel guides forget Trip Advisor or Lonely Planet the Sun has all the crucial info along with a handy photo guide it's not for the faint-hearted though ultraviolence images ahead of the World Cup uses some pretty hard-hitting photos from a 2015 project by a Serbian photographer known as bougie well the images and captions certainly make an impression nationalistic pro-government messages labelled this photo of Army Cadets a tattooed pensioner nexts men drinking and smoking in broad daylight a woman with a bruised face perhaps a victim of those very Russian football thugs with a few references to ultras and drinking thrown in the article then finishes with a classic touch it all makes for a pretty grim picture of the upcoming World Cup although some comments under the piece certainly seem to disagree I would invite the Sun to roam around some of America's inner cities in its heartland Cleveland Detroit Chicago Baltimore and take pictures at night report back on what you find if you're still alive absolutely nothing connecting any of these photos with football hooliganism two men share a smoke and a beer in broad daylight oh my god say it ain't so let's assume for just a moment these are all Russian BOTS and trolls don't take their word for it we caught up with the photographer himself to see what he made of the sun'll story clearly taken out of context and that's pretty much it I trusted them they said it would be the article will be around my photos I never assumed it would be anything like this I thought you would be about my how wrong he was context is everything and looking at that article those fans summer football trips seemed more like a nightmare journey to Mordor the fact is the way I shoot the way I see things I usually capture some darts I think even if I shoot flowers and puppies it's gonna look dark there's nothing to do with the real situation come on it's gonna be perfectly safe no the world company of course and I feel safe in Moscow don't get us wrong these tough urban portraits are a stark reality of what you can find here in Russia as in every major world city but how does that relate to football many would agree that tabloid press pieces should be taken with a pinch of salt but this article is just one drop in the ocean of stories featuring the horrors of Russia and its football thugs waiting around every corner to jump unsuspecting visitors although none of that seems to have put off the tens of thousands of foreign fans who snapped up their tickets and will arrive here in just a few weeks from now well we've requested the Sun newspaper to comment on the photographer's claims who also told us he had asked to remove the article we'll update you as and when we hear a response you
