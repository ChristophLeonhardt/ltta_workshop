00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,640
black celebrities not stepping up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,220
speaking up on to the black lives matter

I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> breathe Eric garner and campaign</font>

32
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,799
I know jay-z was getting a bit of slack

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,210
about it but he actually helped

34
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,150
facilitate the shirts that were one worn

35
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,400
by the cleveland cavaliers and some

36
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,869
other basketball players the I can't

37
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:20,729
breathe shirts the ones that had them in

38
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,549
comic sans kind of made my soul sad but

39
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,619
I'm really appreciative just the effort

40
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,689
in general to stand up and seeing all

41
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:28,740
these celebrities kind of band together

42
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something than</font>

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,049
that cannot go<font color="#E5E5E5"> unsaid um and we do need</font>

clickbait and all that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> foxer should</font>

46
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,409
be taking it too far and quite frankly I

47
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:41,850
feel like a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times these headlines</font>

48
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,490
happen that are disrespectful<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

49
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,899
articles that are happening that are

50
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,399
blatantly disrespectful whether it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

51
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,470
women or black people<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatever</font>

52
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,970
minority people are subjugating at the

53
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,479
time it's just don't share it don't

54
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,950
because they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it because it</font>

55
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,570
gives them stability it builds their

56
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,640
brand awareness and it gets them<font color="#E5E5E5"> clicks</font>

57
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">and AG revenue that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where everyone</font>

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">does it that's why there's no chill when</font>

59
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,979
it comes to this stuff you know I know

60
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,420
every time you started this kind of

61
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,429
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the violence</font>

62
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,550
committed against the authority against

63
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,000
black people this

64
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,590
somebody always comments about what

65
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,410
about black-on-black crime now<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tommy</font>

66
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,480
easy khosro a really good article maybe

67
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">34 years ago in the Atlantic about</font>

68

<font color="#CCCCCC">schleich showing a physical information</font>

69
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,800
showing how communities have reacted to

70
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,510
this kind of theory and black on black

71
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,420
crime it's an oxymoron every person<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

72
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,510
America has a higher threat of being

73
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,490
killed or having crimes committed

74
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,590
against them by their own community

75
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,670
white if we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

76
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,170
black-on-black crime mice will talk

77
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,630
about white on white crime Chinese on

78
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,570
Chinese crime<font color="#E5E5E5"> Korean on Korean crime not</font>

79
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,480
a crazy thought these committees are

80
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,400
actively protesting and raising some

81
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,930
type of awareness about what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

82
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,400
the community and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's how am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font>

83
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,720
was earlier this summer there has been a

84
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,330
lot of talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is going on with</font>

85
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,120
the crime in Chicago it is a complete

86
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,970
warzone happening in Chicago now I into

87
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,440
the point that you know as much as I

88
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,480
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Nicki Minaj when she does a</font>

89
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,370
song a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little herb called shy rack I</font>

90
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,630
just couldn't stand behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I</font>

91
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,640
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't like the term shy rack</font>

92
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,970
I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it glorifies the idea of how</font>

93
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,430
bad the crime rate is in the

94
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,500
lower-income neighborhoods of Chicago

95
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,420
and on top of that I just doubly can't

96
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,280
get behind someone like achieve Keith uh

97
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,410
or any other kind of gangster rapper

98
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,700
that's glorifying these kind of

99
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,090
lifestyles<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's perpetuating a lot of</font>

100
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,590
the problems that are going on in<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

101
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,640
communities now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not to say that</font>

102
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">Chief Keith is to blame with a 300 squad</font>

103
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,590
at the honey whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> its to blame for</font>

104
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,209
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in neighborhoods like</font>

105
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,820
Chicago and other<font color="#CCCCCC"> garda neighborhoods</font>

106
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,620
that have similar issues but I think

107
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,150
Chicago is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most visible and kind of</font>

108
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,730
easiest to attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> upfront feeds kind of</font>

109
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,070
the complexity of the issue you know and

110
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,750
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's our duty to kind of as</font>

111
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,459
people even if we don't live in these

112
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:01,900
communities directly it doesn't directly

113
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,510
impact us you know as self-aware

114
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,370
individuals to be aware of the choices

115
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,310
that we make and how they might project

116
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,190
certain standards or lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> standards</font>

117
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,500
and it's also why I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking more of a</font>

118
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,418
note to stop watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> Coon television</font>

119
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:18,488

giving back to the holiday season we

164
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">could think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little further than just</font>

or tutoring or reading to a young child

172
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,639
or being active in your church or just

173
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,960
being active in your community and

hopefully every little bit of effort can

180
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,470
kind of come together and maybe we might

181
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,530

Negroes what they draws out neither but

237
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,010
it gets excessive when we start to think

238
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,960
that decorum is what's going to save our

239
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,690

253
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,680
where like Bill Cosby is really riding

254
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,500
this wave where he feels like he is

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,260
using this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of don't bring down the</font>

259
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,880
like the case against Bill Cosby is

260
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,740
inherently about bringing down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> black</font>

shaming you know this whole kind of

274
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,830
disposition of the Rolling Stone UVA

275
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,560
rape case and people really<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

276
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,780
attack and tear the story down and I

277

thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> both of my last pops night with</font>

280
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,420
about the rape culture at UVA and

281
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,760
instead of actually addressing the

282
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,220
problem that there it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't matter how</font>

283
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,920
grotesque the rape actually was it

284

happened somebody was sexually assaulted

285
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,890
and nothing was done about it and so why

286
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,980
are we trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deflect and blow up all</font>

287

the smoke and mirrors and not address

the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> of women's rights and and the</font>

woman<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideal and I'll really want to say</font>

309
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,769
too much more about the passing of TT

310
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:33,079
branch because honestly the washington

311
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:35,269
post article was basically a summer a

312
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:39,500
shin<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the lipstick alley board it's</font>

313
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,879
funny every time somebody passes away

314
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:43,970
recently and it's kind of like you can't

315
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,500
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> find any news sources you google</font>

316
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,939
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ellis head is always like I always</font>

317
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,160
the first on google search and so I

318
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,620
rented that thread so try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font>

319
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,939
where this information was coming from

320
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:55,040
and then so when I read The Washington

321
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,959
Post<font color="#E5E5E5"> article I'm like okay well this is</font>

322
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically just you know they summed up</font>

323
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,379
what whole woman said on the thread and

324
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:02,720
the only other person I talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

325
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the envy magazine so family has</font>

331
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,110
hypothesize too much about what was

332
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,879
going on because I don't know and I

333
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,319
respect for her and her family because

334
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:26,689
this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> rough in a very hard time</font>

335
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:28,670

us 10 days to even find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>
