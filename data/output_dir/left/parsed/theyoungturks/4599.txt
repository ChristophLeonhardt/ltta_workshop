>> HE DID RESPOND TO THIS
CRITICISM.
SOME 
PEOPLE DID
RESPOND ON TWITTER BECAUSE IT
TOOK HIM A DAY TO RESPOND.
ONE
PERSON SAID THIS.
DID YOU HAVE A
REACTION WHEN YOU SAW THIS?
I
DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE THE
WHEREWITHAL TO FILL MYSELF IN
THAT SPACE.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO
AUSCHWITZ.
>> IT IS JUST PULLING HER PHONE
AND FILMING SOMETHING.
THEY GIVE
YOU RULES, AND HE SEEMS TO
UNDERSTAND THERE IS A GRAVITY TO
WHERE HE IS AT.
HE JUST THINKS
THIS RULE DOESN'T APPLY TO HIM.
I SEE HIS INTENTION IS TO RAISE
SOME KIND OF AWARENESS ABOUT
SOMETHING.
THAT IS WHY THEY KEEP
AUSCHWITZ WHERE IT IS AS IT IS,
TO RAISE AWARENESS AND MAKE
PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THIS.
NOW THEY
ALSO SAY, HEY, IF YOU GIVE A
DAMN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE,
WE WOULD LIKE YOU NOT 
TO TALK.
I
THINK HE PROBABLY THOUGHT I NEED
TO MAKE A STATEMENT HERE.
AND HE
LINKED THIS VERY REAL MURDER
GENOCIDE SUFFERING TO HIS JOB
WITH HOMELAND SECURITY.
THAT IS
SOMETHING YOU CAN DO LATER.
YOU
CAN COMMUNICATE THAT LATER.
BUT
RIGHT THERE ALL WE HAVE IS
DOCUMENTATION OF YOU
POLITICIZING THIS WHICH IS
SOMETHING THEY JUST DON'T WANT
YOU TO DO.
>> I AM NOT ONE MUCH ON
CEREMONY.
HE IS ALLOWED TO HAVE
HIS POLITICAL OPINION ON
AUSCHWITZ.
I'M GLAD HE CARES
ENOUGH TO HIGHLIGHT IT IN HIS
APOLOGY.
BUT INSIDE THE GAS
CHAMBER TO DO A VIDEO?
A BIT
MUCH.
SO HE HAS RETRACTED IT AND
REALIZES HE SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE
IT.
IF YOU MADE IT AT A LATER
DATE, I WOULD NOT HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH IT.
I WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE A
PROBLEM WITH IT IF HE DID IT
OUTSIDE AS LONG AS HE IS
RESPECTFUL OF THE RULES THERE.
WHAT HE TAKES AWAY FROM IT IS
NOT HUMAN RIGHTS, IT IS NOT
CARING FOR MINORITIES.
THOSE
WOULD BE FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD.
HE GOES TO WE MUST PROTECT THE
HOMELAND.
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT IS KIND OF
WHAT THE OTHER SIDE SAID IN
THAT SITUATION.
