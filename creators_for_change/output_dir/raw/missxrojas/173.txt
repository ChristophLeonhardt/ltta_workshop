00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,009
hello we are nearing the end of my least

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,629
favorite month of the year which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font>

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,460
because it gets all the bad stuff out of

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,340
the way quickly but to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> honest I'm</font>

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,769
feeling like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm feeling inspired</font>

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,200
and overwhelmed and inspired<font color="#CCCCCC"> livewell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,730
them inspired live world and inspired

8
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,160
and overwhelmed and back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and forth and I</font>

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,619
think that's partly to do with not being

10
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,150
honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> with myself and not allowing</font>

11
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,630
myself to not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there are a lot of</font>

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,670
double negatives than that but basically

13
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's okay to not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be okay as they say</font>

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,679
going internet over the last couple of

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,600
years my friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I earn lots of new</font>

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,880
friends amazing big supportive network

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,040
of friends many of you were women have

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,680
one of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> incredible journey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of self</font>

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,780
belief<font color="#E5E5E5"> self confidence and being aware</font>

20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,210
of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have really damaged</font>

21
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,039
us over the years being aware of the

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,890
things societal individual that have

23
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,690
held us<font color="#E5E5E5"> back making an active decision</font>

24
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,610
to find a way to heal from that and to

25
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,230
progress from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also to take some</font>

26
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,219
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things and just put them over</font>

27
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,039
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside of our wonderful life</font>

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,859
existence bubble thing but I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

29
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> present that</font>

30
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,790
stuff to you guys you see it and you see

31
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,830
it in blog<font color="#E5E5E5"> posts and tweets and things</font>

32
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,600
like that on the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand it can be a</font>

33
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">good route to saying you can do this too</font>

34
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,340
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then on the other hand it also feels</font>

35
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,759
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this unattainable expectation this</font>

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,619
unattainable high like we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> having all</font>

37
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,720
the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that we love ourselves all</font>

38
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,330
the time and that a whole life charged

39
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,490
by this current of self-belief and a lot

40
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,920
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways they are but there's still so</font>

41
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,259
many mornings when I wake up and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

42
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,200
I can't do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am an absolute</font>

43
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,850
fave

44
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,720
I am so inadequate I am so terrible I am

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,780
horrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm ugly I am the worst person</font>

46
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,040
in the world I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> NOT an expert anything</font>

47
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,170
everyone hates<font color="#E5E5E5"> me all of this stuff like</font>

48
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,680
that stuff is something that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,600
know whether it ever goes away but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do</font>

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,220
think that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways of learning</font>

51
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">not to pay attention to it but I also</font>

52
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,850
would say that just because you're still

53
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">having those thoughts and just because</font>

54
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,270
you're still feeling that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way doesn't</font>

55
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,580
invalidate the amount progressive<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

56
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,069
made in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> life and it doesn't mean</font>

57
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:09,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you're not truly a self-confident</font>

58
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,399
or that you don't truly have that

59
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,620
self-belief there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a lot of</font>

60
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">doubts constantly when you're asserting</font>

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,350
yourself that doubt is just absolutely

62
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,360
everywhere and you don't realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

63
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,790
agreed it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is until</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you start fighting it</font>

64
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,830
off and when you're fighting off its

65
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,450
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was like really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stubborn and</font>

66
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,680
they just wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in there and it</font>

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,390
just once<font color="#E5E5E5"> and remind you that it's there</font>

68
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,459
even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's struggling and you're</font>

69
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:33,319
getting rid of so many quantities of it

70
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,120
so it gets more terrifying<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like</font>

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,310
fights for its life in it comes back

72
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,620
lash that you and tells you know you're

73
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,450
actually terrible it's not just because

74
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,190
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking in the wrong frame of</font>

75
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,660
mind it's because there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> deep</font>

76
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,190
down in you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is terrible that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

77
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,930
failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's an adequate all of</font>

78
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,750
that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that sometimes we</font>

79
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,640
don't talk about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of the</font>

80
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">charity and having these kind of honest</font>

81
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,420
conversations with yourself but while

82
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,859
you're feeling that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not to get too</font>

83
00:02:57,859 --> 00:02:59,600
introspective or too self-involved but

84
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,910
look that again me saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just then</font>

85
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's me doubting myself and thinking I</font>

86
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,310
sound so self involved in this video I

87
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,840
just sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> like someone who's obsessed</font>

88
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,880
talking about herself but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

89
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,980
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things and taking</font>

90
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,260
that doubt or taking wherever it is that

91
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,630
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting into your head whether it's</font>

92
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,370
someone else's toys whether it's the

93
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,510
voice of what you've heard over the

94
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,060
years whether it's just some what you

95
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,680
feel is some kind of entire learn

96
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,790
adequacy

97
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,459
that putting it over there and

98
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,019
recognizing it and recognizing what

99
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:32,299
needs you to think in that way I think

100
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,920
that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when you come up</font>

101
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,109
against other fears and anxieties that

102
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:37,939
you didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know or realize you</font>

103
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:40,129
had so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> my overwhelmed sighs</font>

104
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:42,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">it where I really manifest itself in my</font>

105
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:43,579
upper back that's probably partly

106
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:44,870
because I spend most of the day hutch

107
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,970
the computer like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I also think</font>

108
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,680
that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something to like the</font>

109
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,569
albatross and carrying the weight and

110
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:53,060
carrying the burden and having just

111
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,129
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of reach that you can't</font>

112
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:57,230
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix almost like the tricksters</font>

113
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">beetle and dr. hood I woke up and I say</font>

114
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:02,000
why am I feeling this way and I had four

115
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,530
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> five different things jump out at me</font>

116
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,689
and I paid attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to each one and</font>

117
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:07,760
address them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and address how I was going</font>

118
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,169
to tackle that problem now this isn't

119
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:11,480
always possible because something can be

120
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,569
so deeply integrate into your life or so

121
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:16,459
nebulous you can't quite hold on to it

122
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,470
so hold on to what you can do and tackle

123
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,570
those problems and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself is an</font>

124
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,880
achievement and then having<font color="#CCCCCC"> tackled that</font>

125
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,470
I think will give you the skills to

126
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,180
tackle the bigger stuff will give you

127
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,710
the skills to have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> courage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask</font>

128
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,180
someone else to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tackle the</font>

129
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,080
bigger stuff whether that's through

130
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,270
therapy through chatting to a friend so

131
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,070
I had a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worries and all</font>

132
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,490
this

133
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,199
stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of it was financial</font>

134
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">taxes and stuff the biggest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and most</font>

135
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,259
unexpected one which has actually come

136
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,940
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in conversation with a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of friends</font>

137
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,270
over the past few weeks or so is that

138
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,190
expectations thing is scrolling through

139
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,410
Instagram scrolling through blogs and

140
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,419
watching videos and seeing these little

141
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:52,009
windows and other people's lives and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

142
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:54,199
know factually that is a tiny section of

143
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,940
the life you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font>

144
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,220
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it not really or at least you know</font>

145
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,930
bits of it and bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a tree to share</font>

146
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">with you and yet sometimes that stuff</font>

147
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,669
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me feel so inadequate I was</font>

148
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:06,380
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone about scrolling</font>

149
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,699
through Instagram and looking into

150
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:10,280
people's amazing home and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these shots</font>

151
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,229
that are just so well put together and

152
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,240
they look like a show home but how does

153
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,039
someone live like that and if they're

154
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,900
pictures of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> put together it must</font>

155
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,280
mean that their life is really put

156
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,990
together and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have this chaos</font>

157
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,190
in their brain they don't have this

158
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,319
immense anxiety about things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

159
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't feel inadequate or if they do feel</font>

160
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,490
inadequate if it's a different kind of

161
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,139
inadequacy because they're not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

162
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:31,580
adequate they know and they can dismiss

163
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,710
it whereas I am actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> inadequate and</font>

164
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">my whole brain is telling me this and</font>

165
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,099
that's where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes we've been put up</font>

166
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:39,229
with images images of that to sell us

167
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:41,780
things and the images of that sure was

168
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,849
want a life is lacking and that's kind

169
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:45,919
of advertising that's how advertising I

170
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,990
think work I read this somewhere i think

171
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,280
it's based on a study but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do</font>

172
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,199
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> research and find out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if this pixel</font>

173
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,159
study then i'll link it in the

174
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,990
description bar below but if you create

175
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,520
a positive feeling with an advert then

176
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,900
it's much more successful than if you

177
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,370
create a negative feeling with an advert

178
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,900
so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about making you feel</font>

179
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,880
ugly and terrible and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font>

180
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,009
it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> making you think I could have</font>

181
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:05,720
that life I want that life

182
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,280
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of experiencing one that's the</font>

183
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,780
kind of feeling I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how we</font>

184
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,370
respond to images and then it's also

185
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,570
stopping yourself respond to these

186
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,610
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> as for the solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get me to</font>

187
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,040
be in that comfortable controlled happy

188
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,020
space is to buy the thing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

189
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,600
picture or is to have a lifestyle like

190
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,130
the person in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this picture even though</font>

191
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,540
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even really know fits their</font>

192
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,740
lifestyle because it's all put together

193
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,020
and framed and you know maybe they just

194
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,870
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a nice picture so it's just</font>

195
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of that stuff is still going on like</font>

196
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,390
we haven't somehow managed to squash

197
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,810
those things we're just still on this

198
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,580
road and we're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sharing the</font>

199
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,380
lessons that we've learned and you're

200
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,520
sharing the lessons that you've learned

201
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,340
with us and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are all</font>

202
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,650
making progress and I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

203
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,390
just because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know those doubts get</font>

204
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,700
into everyone's head some more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

205
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,690
others so I just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be honest about</font>

206
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">ramba you know where I'm at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world</font>
