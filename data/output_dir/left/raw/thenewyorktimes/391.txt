00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,430
Breaking news, North Korea
threatening to take action.

3
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,980
There's a threat of a
strike against Guam.

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,720
--with a threat to attack Guam.

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,620
--on the US territory of Guam.

00:00:09,915 --> 00:00:22,300


8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,180
And as I said.

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,030
They will be met
with fire, fury,

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,365
and frankly power the likes of
which this world has never seen

11
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:31,865
before.

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:01:12,990


13
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,890
Well, the North Korean missile
capability can point in many

14
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,060
directions.

15
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,810
So Guam is not the only place
that could be under threat.

16
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,270
I do not believe that there
is any imminent threat,

17
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,470
in my own view.
