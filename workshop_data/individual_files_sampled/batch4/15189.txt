I've got an important update to bring you about Finance Minister Bill Morneau is allegedly unethical dealings with his family business it's been a bit of a rough week in the House of Commons for Bill Morneau conservatives and to their credit even the NDP have been hammering more know about the sale of his shares in his family-owned business more no Chappelle just before Morneau announced a corporate tax hike in December 2015 that would ultimately go on to affect a stock market and more no Chappelle share price someone dumped six hundred and eighty thousand more no Chappelle shares totaling ten million dollars on about November 30th 2015 because those shares were sold before the announcement whoever sold those shares earned themselves an extra half a million dollars because as a result of Morneau's tax change announcement more no Chappelle shares dropped a full five percent it looks a lot like insider trading and Morneau has a lot to answer for so conservatives were asking the hard questions without getting any real answers and really it should have been an easy yes or no from Bill just watch the markets learned on December 7th the coming into force date of tax increases that moved markets but not before someone was able to get out and avoid the losses was that Minister that person this is a very nice opportunity for us to talk about promises that were kept or someone was able to sell their shares and save a half a million dollars was that person the Minister of Finance I'm not sure how we can be more clear the promise why's that seller the Minister of Finance yes or no in focusing on me what the opposition doesn't want to focus on is what we're actually doing for Canadians someone sold ten million dollars at Morneau Chappelle hairs why is it him once again was that the minister I will continue to advocate on that person is saved a cool half million dollars was the minister of that person we will continue to talk about what we're doing for Canadians but here's the rub Bill Morneau actually told journalist John Iverson that he sold six hundred and eighty thousand more no Chappelle shares at fifteen dollars a share Iverson said in a tweet that he saw a statement dated December 3rd 2015 this is important because on December 7th 2015 Bill Morneau in his role as finance minister announced tax changes that would affect Morneau Chappelle and their share prices so let's recap six hundred and eighty thousand shares of the finance ministers family business totaling ten million dollars just get dumped before an announcement that would affect the price of those same shares and then journalist John Iverson comes out and says that Bill Morneau told him that he sold the exact same number of shares at pretty much the exact same time I think we can all draw our own conclusions here but Bill Morneau also answers to the people of Canada and he needs to tell us what happened here were those his shares being sold just before the tax change announcement but if you thought the Liberals and their shadiness had reached its upper limits you'd be wrong you won't even believe what the Liberals did next the conservatives actually brought forward a motion to call on the finance minister to reveal all his assets that he's bought sold are held within all those private companies or trust funds since he became Finance Minister and the Liberals voted it down of course but pay attention to how the Liberals respond when Morneau stands up to vote here it's real industry minister LeBlanc she living his cheng'er this chiggers Quatro Quatro tomorrow these liberals actually applauded when Bill Morneau stands up to vote on a motion that concerns himself directly instead of having the good sense to turn to old bill and say maybe you should sit this one out because it could be perceived as the direct conflict of interest that it is I mean the motion actually had the words finance minister in it and yet the Finance Minister goes and votes on it the goal of these Liberals Bill Morneau is currently being examined by the Ethics watchdog because he tabled a bill to rewrite federal pension laws that could benefit Morneau chapelle directly Bill Morneau has been tabling laws that benefit his own company possibly selling his own shares to get around impending tax changes that he knows about in advance and now he's voting on issues that name him directly that's why we have to fire Bill Morneau he's using his role as the man in charge of the tax system to paint the rest of us as greedy tax cheats while he enriches himself and his family businesses please sign our petition asking Justin Trudeau to actually do something good for the middle class and get rid of his self-serving finance minister at fire Morneau calm for the rebel media I'm Shiela gun Reid doesn't matter what generation you are some things just never change it used to be the LeBron O's in the sponsorship scandal with the Liberals enriching themselves through government policy now its Finance Minister Bill Morneau to sign our petition calling on Justin Trudeau to do the right thing and fire Bill Morneau go to fire Morneau calm you
