BC's environmentalist government claims that they are blocking the transmat and pipeline to protect their oceans and waterways today I'm going to show you three ways they are complete raging hypocrites our marine economy is considerable our wild salmon stocks are depleting but yet there is considerable economic activity when it comes to our oceans when it comes to our majesty as you all know it's a beautiful place to visit our tourism industry would be severely compromised with an adverse diluted bitumen spill now that clip you saw right there of BC premier John Horgan is from just after the trans mountain pipeline Summit held in Ottawa between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Alberta premier Rachel Notley and Horgan himself over this past weekend the summit was an attempt to save the trans mountain pipeline expansion that BC continues to block from Edmonton to the BC coast now Horgan left that meeting still refusing to allow the pipeline expansion refusing to respect the Canadian Constitution and refusing to acknowledge BC's responsibilities within Confederation and Horgan also left without any real consequences from the Prime Minister BC will still receive their full federal transfers and infrastructure grants despite acting in such an unconcerned Abers and just as crazily nami and Trudeau have decided that their solution to overcoming these foreign funded radicals that they have both played footsie with in the past and who are now opposing the pipeline in British Columbia is to backstop the pipeline with Canadian tax dollars essentially moving the risk of Alberta and the federal government's own inaction onto the rest of us as though money was ever the problem here in the first place Kinder Morgan has money they have lots of investors what they need is the rule of law being enforced here in Canada and what BC needs to do is quit representing itself as though they are climate and environmental heroes because I have three really big examples of where BC fails to be the water keepers they really claim to be now the first example is that despite preening and behaving as though they are climate change evangelizers to the rest of us climate denying barbarians the City of Vancouver is North America's largest exporter of coal according to a report in the National Post BC exported thirty six point eight million tons of coal in 2017 way more than Norfolk Virginia the busiest coal port in the United States and deep in the heart of coal country in fact Vancouver's coal exports alone are larger than the total core production of the entire country of Mexico BC is using their ports to export their fossil fuels and yet they tell me my little pipeline will spell the end of humanity now my second example of British Columbia's hypocrisy is one we talk about quite frequently and it stays on the top of my mind because it is just so very gross according to a report in the Toronto Star British Columbia is responsible for almost 40 percent of all the untreated sewage that flowed into Canada's waterways and oceans in 2016 in 2016 BC dumped over forty five million cubic meters of raw sewage into their oceans and waterways now last month BC had four people contract cholera on Vancouver Island after eating herring eggs now cholera is usually contracted from bacteria in food and water sources infected with fecal matter and another 40 people have contracted norovirus after eating raw oysters and the most probable cause according to the BC Centre for Disease Control is human sewage in the ocean and my last big reason the BC government is a bunch of hypocrites has to do with a mining disaster that happened in 2014 in August 2014 a 40 meter high tailings pond dam at the Mount Polly mine near Williams Lake collapsed dumping 45 million cubic meters of contaminated mining tailings and sludge into the surrounding lakes and rivers including Paul II and quenelle lakes that torrent of copper and go Mining wastes contain contained high levels of arsenic and lead last year nearly three years after the accident and after an investigation that found poor practices and non-compliance of regulations in the lead up to the disaster the BC government granted a long-term permit for the mine to discharge treated mining waste into quenelle Lake now don't get me wrong I'm not against the permit to discharge treated mining waste into the lake I love mining and the town of likely British Columbia needs that mine and I know this permit was granted under the BC Liberals but I am against the hypocrisy of a province that claims to be such water defenders now allowing a company to restart work after such a massive environmental disaster while at the same time not allowing trans Mountains expansion to go ahead after trans Mountain has never caused a marine spill ever at the same time when an act of nature and a failure of boom cannons designed to frighten waterfowl away from a sin crude tailings pond led to the deaths of sixteen hundred ducks in 2008 in Alberta Syncrude paid a three million dollar fine the largest environmental penalty in Alberta history and environmentalists continue to not shut up about that incident ten full years later but back in BC Imperial metals were never charged for violating regulations and no fines were ever issued to them because in environmentalist British Columbia at the time B C's mining laws did not allow for administrative penalties as in B C's regulations were not as strict as Alberta's so I think BC can stop telling us that they are concerned about protecting the water or you know what here's a better idea Trudeau can stop buying you that stupid excuse to block Canadian oil and gas for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read what you just saw there is my daily
