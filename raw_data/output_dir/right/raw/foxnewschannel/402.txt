1
00:00:37,423 --> 00:00:38,256
MAYBE HE RESPONDED THE RIGHT WAY

2
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:39,490
BEFORE HE WENT BEFORE THE SENATE

3
00:00:39,491 --> 00:00:41,359
AND SHOWED RIGHTEOUS ANGER AND

4
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,766
INDIGNATION AFTER BEING ACCUSED

5
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:51,436
OF BEING A GANG.

6
00:00:51,437 --> 00:00:52,837
BEFORE I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF

7
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:53,638
SUSAN COLLINS DID THAT.

8
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:55,573
I THINK SHE IS A SERIOUS PERSON

9
00:00:55,574 --> 00:00:58,609
AND REALLY SET A STANDARD AND

10
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,813
SAID, LET'S GET AN INVESTIGATIO

11
00:01:01,814 --> 00:01:02,246
INVESTIGATION.

12
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:03,014
APPARENTLY THE FBI CAME BACK AND

13
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:05,016
SAID, THERE IS NOTHING THERE.

14
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:06,818
>> Sean: BUT THEY REITERATED

15
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:07,952
THE SENATE JUDICIARY

16
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:10,521
INVESTIGATION.

17
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:12,056
>> Newt: YES.

18
00:01:12,057 --> 00:01:14,025
SO MY GUESS IS YOU HAVE

19
00:01:14,026 --> 00:01:16,494
SENATOR COLLINS AND

20
00:01:16,495 --> 00:01:17,628
SENATOR MURKOWSKI WHICH ARE

21
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:20,231
SOLID PEOPLE THAT HAVE TALK THIS

22
00:01:20,232 --> 00:01:21,732
THROUGH, AND I THINK THEY WILL

23
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:25,970
TALK THIS THROUGH FOR THE JUDGE.

24
00:01:25,971 --> 00:01:27,872
I DON'T KNOW WHAT FLAKE WILL DO

25
00:01:27,873 --> 00:01:28,639
ALTHOUGH HE INDICATED PRETTY

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,875
CLEARLY IF THE FBI COMES UP WITH

27
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:32,677
NOTHING, HE WILL VOTE YES.

28
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:35,046
I THINK THE ODDS ARE PRETTY HIGH

29
00:01:35,047 --> 00:01:36,747
THAT JOE MANCHIN, THE SENATOR

30
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:37,482
FROM WEST VIRGINIA IS GOING TO

31
00:01:37,483 --> 00:01:40,251
VOTE YES.

32
00:01:40,252 --> 00:01:42,053
YOU WILL BE IN A STATE WHERE

33
00:01:42,054 --> 00:01:44,856
TRUMP GOT 46% MARGIN, IT'S A

34
00:01:44,857 --> 00:01:47,124
CERTAIN LEVEL OF, IF YOU ARE UP

35
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,259
FOR REELECTION, PRESUMPTION.

36
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,527
SO TONIGHT MAYBE THINGS WILL

37
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:51,963
CHANGE BUT MY SENSES TONIGHT

38
00:01:51,964 --> 00:01:53,631
THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE

39
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:57,235
EITHER SATURDAY OR MONDAY, A

40
00:01:57,236 --> 00:02:00,238
"YES" VOTE, AND HE WILL BE

41
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,205
CONFIRMED.

42
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:04,041
THE ONE I HOPE YOU ARE RIGHT.

43
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:04,575
34 DAYS FROM NOW.

44
00:02:04,576 --> 00:02:09,046
I KNEW YOU BACK IN '94.

45
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:10,448
I KNEW YOU THE DAY OF THE

46
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,251
ELECTION AND THE DAY BEFORE.

47
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:15,853
THAT'S A NIGHT YOU BECAME

48
00:02:15,854 --> 00:02:18,222
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.

49
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:19,423
RENEWING CIVILIZATION,

50
00:02:19,424 --> 00:02:20,124
CULMINATING A CONTRACT WITH

51
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,860
AMERICA AND CULMINATING THE

52
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:24,061
REPUBLICANS COMING TO POWER FOR

53
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:26,063
THE FIRST TIME IN 40 YEARS.

54
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:28,266
CONFIDENT, WE ARE GOING TO WIN.

55
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:30,067
THAT'S A PRETTY BOLD PREDICTION

56
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:31,269
CONSIDERING REPUBLICANS HADN'T

57
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,870
WON IN 40 YEARS, BUT WERE RIGHT.

58
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:35,072
YOU HAVE A DEGREE OF OPTIMISM

59
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:36,774
ABOUT THE ELECTION IN 34 DAYS

60
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:38,376
MAY BE BECAUSE I'M IRISH, OR

61
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:41,445
MAYBE BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS

62
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:42,513
EXPECTED THE WORST THE NEXT

63
00:02:42,514 --> 00:02:44,448
SECOND OF ANY DAY BUT I DON'T

64
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:46,417
HAVE THE CONFIDENCE YOU DO.

65
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:49,654
>> I THINK I'M A LOT LIKE REAGAN

66
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:51,455
IN THAT I REALLY BELIEVE IN THE

67
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:52,657
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

68
00:02:52,658 --> 00:02:53,925
I BELIEVE THE AVERAGE AMERICAN

69
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:56,127
SAW ALL OF THIS CHARACTER

70
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:00,064
ASSASSINATION, SMEARING,

71
00:03:00,065 --> 00:03:00,731
DISHONESTY AND MANIPULATION.

72
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:02,466
I THINK THEY LOOK AT A

73
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:03,734
REPUBLICAN TEAM LED BY TRUMP

74
00:03:03,735 --> 00:03:06,604
THAT IS A REALLY DELIVERING AND

75
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:08,072
GETTING THINGS DONE, AND SO

76
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:10,508
THEN, THEY LOOK OVER HERE AT THE

77
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:11,609
IS DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE REALLY

78
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,846
BEEN TRYING TO BLOCK EVERYTHING,

79
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:18,449
AND THEY HAVE IT RESULTS OVER

80
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,650
HERE, REAL RESULTS.

81
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:22,053
JOBS, BREAKTHROUGHS ON TRADE,

82
00:03:22,054 --> 00:03:23,154
THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING THAT

83
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:23,654
ARE TREMENDOUS.

84
00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:25,690
YOU LOOK OVER HERE AT THESE

85
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:27,858
PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO FIGHT

86
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:28,259
EVERYTHING.

87
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,062
I SAID, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO

88
00:03:31,063 --> 00:03:33,264
ME IN 2016, BECAUSE I REMEMBER

89
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:35,833
DOING A SHOW WITH MEGYN KELLY

90
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:37,034
TWO WEEKS OUT.

91
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:40,738
AND I FINALLY SAID, -- AND IT'S

92
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:41,439
IN THE TAPE.

93
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,007
I DON'T THINK AMERICAN PEOPLE

94
00:03:43,008 --> 00:03:44,241
ARE GOING TO LIKE SOMEBODY AS

95
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:46,110
CORRUPT AS HILLARY CLINTON.

96
00:03:46,111 --> 00:03:48,379
I JUST DIDN'T BELIEVE IT ABOUT

97
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,448
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

98
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:52,116
I DO NOT BELIEVE TONIGHT THAT

99
00:03:52,117 --> 00:03:55,319
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

100
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,255
REWARD LEFT-WING SOCIALISTS,

101
00:03:58,256 --> 00:04:01,025
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO OBSTRUCT

102
00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:01,659
EVERYTHING, BY GIVING THEM

103
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,361
POWER.

104
00:04:03,362 --> 00:04:04,829
SO I AM MODERATELY OPTIMISTIC.

105
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,063
I WOULDN'T BET THE FAMILY FARM

106
00:04:06,064 --> 00:04:09,266
BUT I WOULD BET A HORSE OR TWO.

107
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:11,068
>> Sean: I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW

108
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:13,738
YOU HAD HORSES BUT, GLAD TO HEAR

109
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:14,005
IT.

110
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:16,641
IT COMES DOWN TO INDIVIDUAL

111
00:04:16,642 --> 00:04:17,842
DISTRICTS.

112
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:19,443
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF NEW

113
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:21,512
PEOPLE, LOTS OF RETIREMENTS THIS

114
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:21,845
YEAR.

115
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:23,880
THAT RAISES AN UNKNOWN QUESTION.

116
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:25,483
I DO THINK JOE MANCHIN IS IN

117
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:27,918
TROUBLE, I THINK NELSON IS IN

118
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:34,692
TROUBLE, DONNELLY IS IN TROUBLE,

119
00:04:34,693 --> 00:04:36,260
HESTER AND MONTANA -- SOME OF

120
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:38,729
THESE RACES ARE VERY CLOSE

121
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,633
BUT -- >> Newt: I THINK THE

122
00:04:42,634 --> 00:04:44,268
SENATE, WE ARE VERY -- AND BY

123
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:45,736
THE WAY IN MINNESOTA, YOU HAVE A

124
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:47,271
VERY REAL POSSIBILITY OF AN

125
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:49,540
UPSET BECAUSE I THINK THE

126
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,176
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IS A VERY

127
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:56,814
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN AND THE OTHER

128
00:04:56,815 --> 00:05:03,087
NOMINEE HAS TO CARRY THE SOUL

129
00:05:03,088 --> 00:05:03,688
WRATH OF KEITH ELLISON.

130
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:05,690
HOW DOES SHE CAMPAIGN A TICKET

131
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:06,557
WHEN TWO DIFFERENT WOMEN SAY

132
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:08,959
THAT HE HAD TO USE THEM?

133
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,928
>> Sean: WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK

134
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:12,363
FOR AN FBI INVESTIGATION INTO

135
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:12,697
HIM?

136
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:15,032
OR IF WE ARE GOING BACK TO

137
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:15,766
KAVANAUGH'S TEENAGE SHEET YEARS

138
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:18,936
THEN WE COULD AT LEAST GO BACK

139
00:05:18,937 --> 00:05:20,438
TO THE TIME WHERE BILL CLINTON

140
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:22,106
WAS THE ARKANSAS

141
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:24,008
ATTORNEY GENERAL, WASN'T HE?

142
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:26,243
>> I JUST THINK THE PRESIDENT

143
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:26,944
WILL BE IN MINNESOTA TOMORROW

144
00:05:26,945 --> 00:05:30,414
AND HE WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO --

145
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:33,017
>> THESE ARE STATES THAT YOU

146
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:35,352
WOULDN'T THINK, WHERE THE HOUSES

147
00:05:35,353 --> 00:05:35,720
AND PLAY.

148
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:37,354
>> AND A NUMBER OF THESE PLACES

149
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:38,556
HE WILL BE ABLE TO GO IN AND

150
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:40,391
CAMPAIGN FOR THE HOUSE NUMBER

151
00:05:40,392 --> 00:05:48,065
AND YOU CAN SEE THE SWEET

152
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:48,866
BUILDING.

153
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:50,334
BE ONE WHERE THE HISTORIAN, IT'S

154
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:52,670
ONLY HAPPENED THREE TIMES IN 100

155
00:05:52,671 --> 00:05:53,471
YEARS.

156
00:05:53,472 --> 00:05:55,673
THE PARTY WINS THE WHITE HOUSE

157
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:57,374
AND DOESN'T LOSE SEATS IN THE

158
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,877
FIRST MIDTERM.

159
00:05:59,878 --> 00:06:00,678
>> I DON'T WANT TO SOUND SILLY

160
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:04,348
ABOUT THIS BUT, ALL I CAN TELL

161
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:08,385
YOU IS, YOU ARE IN A DIFFERENT

162
00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:09,253
WORLD RIGHT NOW.

163
00:06:09,254 --> 00:06:11,055
YOU GOT SOMEBODY WHO IS A GREAT

164
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:14,725
NATURAL CAMPAIGNER AND DRAWS

165
00:06:14,726 --> 00:06:15,459
HUGE CROWDS.

166
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,660
>> Sean: ALL THESE SUPPORTERS

167
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:18,129
UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT THEY VOTED

168
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,396
FOR IN 2016 THAT THEY HAVE TRIED

169
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:22,233
TO TEAR DOWN ALMOST FROM DAY

170
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:23,067
ONE, AND DESTROY HIM, DO YOU

171
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:25,169
THINK THAT THEY KNOW THAT THAT

172
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,305
IS ALL IN JEOPARDY?

173
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:31,075
>> Newt: I THINK THE LIBERALS

174
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:32,510
ASSAULT ON KAVANAUGH HAS AROUSED

175
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:35,913
CONSERVATIVES AND MODERATES,

176
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:36,647
DECENT PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO

177
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:39,083
BELIEVE IN THE RULE OF LAW AND

178
00:06:39,084 --> 00:06:40,084
PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN FAIRNESS.

179
00:06:40,085 --> 00:06:43,621
I WAS IN PHOENIX YESTERDAY WITH

180
00:06:43,622 --> 00:06:45,089
ABOUT 850 PEOPLE AT A

181
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,923
RADIO STATION.

182
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:47,892
THE ONE THAT'S NOT QUITE THE

183
00:06:47,893 --> 00:06:50,661
SIZE OF A TRUMP RALLY.

184
00:06:50,662 --> 00:06:51,262
I'M JUST TEASING.

185
00:06:51,263 --> 00:06:53,464
>> Newt: AND NEITHER HE NOR I

186
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:54,598
GET 6 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE

187
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:54,932
EVENING.

188
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:59,069
