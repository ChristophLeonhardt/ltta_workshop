1
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:12,499
It's just amazing, like 
I can see everything,

2
00:00:12,499 --> 00:00:20,549
like Central Park all the way down 
to the World Trade Center.

3
00:00:24,974 --> 00:00:30,506
It's just me, my partner 
and the window, that's it.

4
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:38,115
Up there you don't hear nothing,

5
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:41,115
it's just when you go down, 
all the way down,

6
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:45,459
that you hear the commotion of the 
cars and horns, you know all that stuff.

7
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:49,918
The firefighters, ambulance 
and stuff like that.

8
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:53,371
But once you're up there 
you don't hear nothing.

9
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:19,969
People think I'm crazy but,

10
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:24,599
I prefer to be in there looking at 
people working in the office,

11
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:30,023
than me working in the office, because I 
don't stay there on the computer all day.

12
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,490
And it's not that scary, you know,

13
00:01:32,490 --> 00:00:00,000
roller coasters are scarier than that.
