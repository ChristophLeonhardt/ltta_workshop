and actually cover that coming YouTube
it's me Evelyn and I have conditioner
all in my hair because I'm going to do
something I've never done before
I'm going to use BAM
what curlformers are are these little
plastic east bringing things and it
curls your hair by stringing it through
see you there
hair goes in here and using some magical
tool you get perfect curls I'm not sure
how my ends will be straight because
there's no tension on my ends when I
apply and I put on the curlformers but
we'll see this is not a tutorial because
I have not yet mastered it myself and
this will take me in a long time I have
orange and pink crow formers I don't
know what that means but I'll let you
know right here just set my hair I have
Jane Carter wrap and roll game card a
solution wrap and roll Bram here's the
price and you know for the price I think
it's worth it we need to get motions or
something at the supply store but um for
something like this where are you only
going to use it several times in a year
I say I guess you know invest in
something that has a little better
ingredients you know you feel me
okay so you boil it up you do the coil
as you can see so it's coiled
then you hate making sure the tip is wet
well below the look take the hook and
put it in like that okay so now my piece
of hair is here and the hook is right
there this is the part I don't know how
to do can you just pull your hair
through and as you can see my hair is
all from there and that is it so I'm
going to continue this in a mirror on
the mirror Adam here
it's not only and on
especially because to interest fears
oh it's finally done I'm gonna go dry my
hair under interlayer and under them
you
are you sure is a dry John no check
I mean my roots is dry my wrist is dry
what I'm gonna do the intro to was
attention ever done we just sing so
nobody can see me take it out of town
the round and then save touchdown
Kissimmee Chan supply and a long path
bad I need you to take seven beam me up
last time ten minutes go
they're nappy curdled make blue happy
screams gasps who was the part closest
to my ribs are straight because explicit
eyes in the end this way I didn't
understand that's why did think he's a
guard on a pearly because how do you
explain getting pens which are already
in here to the straight come down but uh
