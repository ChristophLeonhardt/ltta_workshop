BIPARTISAN WAY TO ENACT.

00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:05,171
PAYING JOBS. 

4
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,606
PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED TO

00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:07,841
DRAIN THE SWAMP. 

6
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,877
BUT HE'S TURNED IT INTO A 

7
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:11,143
CESSPOOL. 

8
00:00:11,143 --> 00:00:12,779

SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN

PEOPLE. 

17
00:00:24,056 --> 00:00:26,159
DEMOCRATS ARE HERE TO OFFER A 

18
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,828
BETTER DEAL FOR THE PEOPLE WITH

00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,095
BETTER JOBS, BETTER WAGES AND 

20
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:30,663
BETTER FUTURE. 

21
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,564
NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BE 

22
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:34,334
EXCUSED BECAUSE THEY HAVE MOVED 

23
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:37,303

>> WE COULD POSSIBLY DO THAT. 

28
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:47,046
IT DEPENDS ON HOW LONG IT TAKES 

29
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:47,847
WE'LL SEE. 

30
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:48,247
OKAY THANK YOU. 

31
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:49,282
THAT'S UP TO YOU BECAUSE I KNOW 

32
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:52,819
THE ROOM IS USED BY OTHERS 

33
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:53,119
FOLLOWING. 

34
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:53,953
>> SO NANCY PELOSI HAVING TO 

35
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,054
RUN OFF AND NOT TAKING 

36
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,689
QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS OF 

37
00:00:56,689 --> 00:01:00,359
MEDIA AND AUDIENCE THERE. 

38
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:00,994
SHE REITERATED HER 

39
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,428
DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE RUSSIA 

40
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:04,197
SUMMIT SAYING THAT THE 

41
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,131
PRESIDENT LOOKED FRIGHTENED. 

42
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:06,032
STANDING NEXT TO VLADIMIR 

43
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:06,265
PUTIN. 

44
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:09,169
AND THEN THERE WAS SORT OF A 

45
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,837
LONG LAUNDRY LIST OF OTHER WAYS 

46
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:13,806
IN WHICH SHE IS DISAPPOINTED BY 

47
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:14,307
THE PRESIDENT. 

48
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,575
BUT ONCE AGAIN THE INITIAL 

49
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:17,744
FOCUS WAS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF 

50
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,779
SHORING UP THE SECURITY FOR THE 

51
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,381
ELECTION SYSTEM HERE AS WE MOVE 

52
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,915
INTO OF COURSE MIDTERM 

53
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:23,215
ELECTIONS. 

54
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:25,051
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

55
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:25,284
BREAK. 

56
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:25,885
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN AND WE 

57
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,588
ARE ALWAYS ON. 

58
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,091
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS RAMPING 

59
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,225
UP HIS ATTACKS ON THOSE WHO 

60
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,625
HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF HIS 

61
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,793
SUMMIT WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. 

62
00:04:21,793 --> 00:04:24,430
MR. TRUMP TWEETED EARLIER TODAY

65
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,902
WITH THE REAL ENEMY OF THE 

66
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:30,203
PEOPLE. 

67
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,303
THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA. 

68
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:33,206
THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAID THAT HE 

69
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:37,677
NOW LOOKS FORWARD TO A SECOND 

70
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,477
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN. 

71
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:39,712
>>> REPUBLICAN SENATOR JAMES 

72
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,214
LANGFORD OF OKLAHOMA JOINS ME 

73
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,114

GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. 

78
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:50,456
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SENATOR

00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,557
FOR JOINING US. 

80
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:51,857
>> GLAD TO. 

81
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:53,493
>> SO WHEN THE PRESIDENT SPOKE 

82
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,862
TO JEFF GLOR, HE TOLD HIM THAT 

83
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,997
VLADIMIR PUTIN -- THAT HE TOLD 

84
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,298
VLADIMIR PUTIN IN THAT SUMMIT 

85
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:00,532
IN THAT PRIVATE ONE-ON-ONE 

86
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:03,035
MEETING, HE TOLD HIM TO STOP 

87
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:04,503
INTERFERING WITH OUR ELECTION. 

88
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:06,272
HE DIDN'T MENTION THAT DURING 

89
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:06,872
THE PRESS CONFERENCE. 

90
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:08,708
DO YOU WISH HE HAD SAID 

91
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,141
SOMETHING PUBLICLY? 

92
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:10,743
DO YOU THINK HE DID ENOUGH? 

93
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:11,944
>> WELL, WE'LL KNOW IN THE DAYS 

94
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,180
AHEAD WHETHER HE DID ENOUGH AND 

95
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,716
I DO WISH HE HAD SAID SOMETHING 

96
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:16,983
PUBLICLY. 

97
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,418
THAT WAS A GOOD MOMENT TO BE 

98
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,652
ABLE TO PUSH BACK. 

99
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,687
HE DIDN'T CHOOSE TO DO THAT. 

100
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:22,688
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID TO 

101
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:24,924
PRESIDENT PUTIN IN THE PAST 

102
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:25,825
KNOCK IT OFF. 

103
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,160
I THINK WAS THE PHRASE THAT HE 

104
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,627
USED TO BE ABLE TO TOYOTA. 

105
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:31,897
ULTIMATELY PUT -- STOP IT. 

106
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:32,965
ULTIMATELY PUT ADDITIONAL 

107
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,099
PRESSURE ON RUSSIA. 

108
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:35,601
WE HAVE SANCTIONS ON THE 

109
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,303
OLIGARCHS THAT FUNDED THE 

110
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:37,836
SOCIAL MEDIA ATTACK. 

111
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:39,104
IT'S TIME TO ALSO ADD SANCTIONS 

112
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:40,940
TO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE 

113
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,607
DIRECTLY ATTACKING OUR SYSTEMS. 

114
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,177
>> YOU KNOW THE WHITE HOUSE AND 

115
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,812
THE PRESIDENT HAVE SUGGESTED ON 

116
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,780
MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THERE 

117
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,215
ARE OTHER ACTORS ATTEMPTING TO 

118
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:49,849
INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTIONS, I 

119
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,317
WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF 

120
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,084
SOUND FOR SECURE THEN WE'LL 

121
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:54,720
TALK -- YOU AND THEN WE'LL TALK 

122
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,020
AFTERWARDS. 

123
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,492
>> I ACCEPT OUR INTELLIGENCE 

124
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,528
COMMUNITY'S CONCLUSION THAT 

125
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,698
RUSSIA'S MEDDLING IN THE 2016 

126
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,732
ELECTION TOOK PLACE. 

127
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:08,434
COULD BE OTHER PEOPLE ALSO. 

128
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,470
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT 

129
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:10,970
THERE. 

130
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,038
>> WEAR AWARE OF OTHERS THAT 

131
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,073
HAVE -- WE'RE AWARE OF OTHERS 

132
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,274
THAT HAVE MADE ATTEMPTS BUT I 

133
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,175
CAN'T GET INTO OTHERS AT THIS 

134
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:16,408
POINT. 

135
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,811
>> YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE 

136
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,446
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, ARE YOU 

137
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:21,680
AWARE OF OTHER ACTORS ATTEMPT 

138
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,753
TO BE MEDDLE IN THE U.S --   

139
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:29,655
U.S -- ATTEMPTING TO MEDDLE IN 

140
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,289
THE U.S. ELECTIONS? 

141
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,724
>> THE LEVEL THAT THE RUSSIANS 

142
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,526
HAVE DONE IS FAR AND AWAY 

143
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,494
GREATER THAN ANYONE ELSE THAT'S 

144
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:37,196
TRIED TO DO AND IT THE 

145
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,097
COORDINATION BETWEEN THE 

146
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,264
GOVERNMENT AND BETWEEN PRIVATE 

147
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:40,365
ENTITIES LIKE THE INTERNET 

148
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:41,868
RESEARCH AGENCY AND OTHER 

149
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,170
ENTITIES THEY'RE PUSHING OUT TO 

150
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,171
AFFECT OUR ELECTIONS DWARF 

151
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,105
ANYONE ELSE BY COMPARISON. 

152
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,206
THINK KEEPING THE FOCUS ON WHAT 

153
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:48,541
THE RUSSIANS HAVE DONE IS A 

154
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,942
GOOD THING TO BE ABLE TO DO BUT 

155
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:50,843
ALSO BEING AWARE THAT THEY'RE 

156
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,111
NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE OUT 

157
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:52,612
THERE. 

158
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:53,613
THAT COULD TRY TO INTERFERE IN 

159
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,113
OUR ELECTIONS. 

160
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,315
>> SO WHO ARE THESE OTHER 

161
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:56,548
ACTORS? 

162
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:57,849
OTHER COUNTRIES AND IS THE 

163
00:06:57,849 --> 00:06:58,483
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ATTEMPTING 

164
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:00,386
TO PROSECUTE THEM AS WELL? 

165
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:01,220
>> WELL, WE'RE GOING THROUGH 

166
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,121
INVESTIGATING I MEAN IT'S NOT 

167
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,723
AS EASY AS IT LOOKS ON THE 

168
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,258
MOVIE TO BE ABLE TO SEE AND 

169
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,158
IDENTIFY EXACTLY WHERE 

170
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:08,427
EVERYTHING IS COMING FROM. 

171
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:16,469
WHAT'S CALLED TRICK WHEN YOU 

172
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,470
SEE DIFFERENT -- AATRANSCRIBE 

173
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:17,737
USE. 

174
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:21,340
SOMETIMES YOU CAN TELL WHERE 

175
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:21,973
THAT'S COMING FROM AND STATION 

176
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:23,275
SOMETIMES IT MAKES MONTHS AND 

177
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:23,942
MONTHS OF RESEARCH. 

178
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:24,977
BUT IT'S A LISTENING TIME. 

179
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:25,811
AGAIN I COME BACK TO THERE'S NO 

180
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:27,547
ONE DOING IT LIKE THE LEVEL THE 

181
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,513
RUSSIANS ARE DOING IT. 

182
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:29,749
NOT ONLY ACROSS ALL OF EUROPE 

183
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,084
AND UKRAINE AND OTHER AREAS BUT 

184
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,585
AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. 

185
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:34,186
>> ALL RIGHT, SO IN INSPHERE 

186
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:35,788
VIEW BEFORE THAT SUMMIT. 

187
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,157
YOU TOLD NRP THAT THE 12 

188
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,625
RUSSIANS CHARGED WITH HACKING 

189
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,493
WOULD GIVE THE PRESIDENT 

190
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:43,396
LEVERAGE ONCE HE IS SITTING 

191
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,730
DOWN WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. 

192
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,798
YOU CALLED IT A GIFT FROM 

193
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,333
MUELLER BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE 

194
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,534
PRESIDENT COULD CITE CLEAR 

195
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,568
EVIDENCE THAT RUSSIA INTERFERED 

196
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:50,436
IN THE ELECTION. 

197
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,371
DO YOU BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT 

198
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,472
USED THAT INFORMATION AS 

199
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:56,008
LEVERAGE WHEN HE WAS WITH THE 

200
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:56,408
POTION PRESIDENT? 

201
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:57,676
>> YEAH THAT -- RUSSIAN 

202
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:58,244
PRESIDENT? 

203
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,345
>> YEAH THAT I DON'T KNOW 

204
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,380
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT 

205
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,215
HAPPENED IN THAT TWO HOUR 

206
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:04,617
CONVERSATION ON IT AND QUITE 

207
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,251
FRANKLY SHOULDN'T KNOW. 

208
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,852
I WOULD HOPE THAT HE WOULD VERY 

209
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:08,888
SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS DONE BY 

210
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,222
QUITE FRANKLY BY CHRIS WALLACE 

211
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:11,490
IN AN INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT 

212
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,625
PUTIN WHEN HE HAD THE 

213
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,359
INDICTMENT IN HIS HAND AND 

214
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,227
TRIED TO HAND IT RIGHT TO 

215
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:17,029
PRESIDENT PUTIN TO SAY THIS IS 

216
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,130
WHERE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS AND 

217
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,365
-- WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS AND 

218
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,900
OF COURSE PUTIN WOULDN'T ACCEPT 

219
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,066
IT. 

220
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,101
THE BIG ISSUE THOUGH IS WE DO 

221
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,202
HAVE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THAT. 

222
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:27,539
WE'VE HAD IT FOR A LONG TIME 

223
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:28,240
AND OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 

224
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,276
HAS SEEN IT FOR A LONG TIME. 

225
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,743
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I'M GLAD 

226
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,812
HAS COME OUT OF THE PUBLIC IN 

227
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,145
THE DETAIL THAT IT HAS AND TO 

228
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:35,548
BE ABLE TO USE THAT TO SAY TO 

229
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,649
THE RUSSIANS YOU'VE GOT TO BE 

230
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:37,883
ABLE TO STOP OR WE'LL CONTINUE 

231
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:38,851
TO ADD SANCTIONS TO YOU. 

232
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,253
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU A DEABOUT 

233
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:42,221
A TOPIC THAT SAY -- QUESTION 

234
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,056
ABOUT A TOPIC THAT SARAH 

235
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:44,690
SANDERS WAS ASKED ABOUT 

236
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:44,990
YESTERDAY. 

237
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,359
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS NOT YET 

238
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,161
REJECTED PUTIN'S INTEREST IN 

239
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:49,962
QUESTIONING SEVERAL AMERICANS 

240
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:54,033
INCLUDING FORMER AMBASSADOR TO 

241
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,034
RUSSIA MICHAEL McFALL FOR 

242
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:55,401
ALLEGED CRIMES. 

243
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,669
THAT WOULD BE IN EXCHANGE FOR 

244
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,137
THE U.S. QUESTIONING THE 12 

245
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,073
RUSSIAN OFFICERS CHARGED WITH 

246
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:01,573
HACKING INTO THE DNC. 

247
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:04,110
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD 

248
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:04,377
SUPPORT? 

249
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,245
>> I WOULD SAY ABSOLUTELY THAT 

250
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,580
IT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD NOT 

251
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:07,880
ENTERTAIN. 

252
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,382
NOT GOING TO TURN OVER AN 

253
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,783
AMERICAN CITIZEN TO A RUSSIAN 

254
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:11,917
COURT OR A RUSSIAN INVESTIGATOR 

255
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,419
TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THEIR 

256
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,921
LIFE AND THEIR PERSONAL LIFE. 

257
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,089
WE'VE SEEN LOTS OF ABUSES OF 

258
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:17,289
THAT. 

259
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:17,990
OBVIOUSLY RUSSIA DOES NOT HAVE 

260
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,725
FREE COURTS THEY DON'T HAVE A 

261
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,159
FREE PRESS. 

262
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,026
THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME 

263
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:21,761
INDEPENDENCE THAT WE HAVE IN 

264
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:22,928
THE UNITED STATES. 

265
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:25,431
AND I HAVE ZERO TRUST FOR THEIR 

266
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:25,764
LEGAL SYSTEM. 

267
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:27,366
SO I WOULD ABSOLUTELY OPPOSE 

268
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,167
ANY AMERICAN BEING TURNED OVER 

269
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,502
TO ANY RUSSIAN FOR QUESTIONING 

270
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,202
LIKE THAT. 

271
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,036
>> YOU KNOW ALL -- 

272
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:32,671
>> ESPECIALLY A DIPLOMAT. 

273
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,639
>> RIGHT. 

274
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,707
ALL THIS CONVERSATION ASIDE, 

275
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,676
WE'RE HEADING INTO THE MIDTERM 

276
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:37,076
ELECTION. 

277
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:37,776
YOU KNOW, AMERICANS ARE 

278
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:38,076
CONCERNED. 

279
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:40,545
WE KNOW NOW THAT THE RUSSIANS 

280
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:42,214
CONTINUE TO MEDDLE OR ATTEMPT 

281
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,583
TO MEDDLE IN OUR ELECTORAL 

282
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,051
SYSTEM. 

283
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:48,321
WHAT CONFIDENCE CAN YOU GIVE 

284
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,422
VOTERS THAT THE MIDTERM 

285
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,322
ELECTIONS WILL BE PROTECTED? 

286
00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:51,357
I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON A 

287
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:51,557
BILL. 

288
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,592
>> SURE, I AM WORKING ON A BILL 

289
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:55,561
A BIPARTISAN BILL WITH AMY 

290
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,628
KLOBUCHAR THAT WE WORKED ON FOR 

291
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:58,297
MONTHS AND MONTHS TO BE ABLE GO 

292
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:58,931
THROUGH THIS PROCESS. 

293
00:09:58,931 --> 00:09:59,999
HAD TWO HEARINGS IN THE RULES 

294
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,434
COMMITTEE RECENTLY AND WORKING 

295
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,969
TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT TO THE 

296
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:04,202
FLOOR. 

297
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:05,271
BUT INTERESTING A LOT OF 

298
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,272
REPORTING ON DIFFERENT 

299
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:06,872
STATEMENTS MADE BY THE 

300
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,008
ADMINISTRATION ONE WAY OR THE 

301
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:09,809
OTHER ABOUT RUSSIA BUT THEIR 

302
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,644
WORK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF 

303
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,746
HOMELAND SECURITY ON SECURING 

304
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:17,282
OUR ELECTIONS HAS BEEN STELLAR. 

305
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:20,786
THEY HAVE WORKS VERY HARD TO BE 

306
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,388
ABLE TO GIVE SECURITY 

307
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:22,688
CLEARANCE. 

308
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,290
WORKING TO EVALUATE THE CYBER 

309
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,825
PROTECTIONS FOR EVERY STATE 

310
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,392
THAT MADE THE REQUEST. 

311
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:28,227
OBVIOUSLY STATES RUN ELECTIONS 

312
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,029
BUT IF A STATE REQUESTED IT THE 

313
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:30,930
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS STEPPING 

314
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,164
IN TO PROVIDE THEM ADDITIONAL 

315
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,866
ASSISTANCE TO BE ABLE TO WORK 

316
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:37,103
ON MAKING SURE THEIR SYSTEM IS 

317
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:37,336
SECURE. 

318
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:37,937
WE JUST ALLOTTED $380 MILLION 

319
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,439
TO THE STATES TO BE ALLOWED TO 

320
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,439
UPGRADE THE SYSTEMS AND 

321
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:43,608
SECURITY UPGRADE ULTIMATELY 

322
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:43,975
THEIR MACHINES. 

323
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:45,010
NOW THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO 

324
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,078
CHANGE THE ELECTION MACHINES BY 

325
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,146
2018 BUT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO 

326
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,747
DO IT BY 2020. 

327
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:50,048
BUT AGAIN, I REPEAT. 

328
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:51,149
IT'S A STATE'S SPEEDOMETER TO 

329
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,250
BE ABLE TO -- RESPONSIBILITY TO 

330
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,218
BE ABLE TO RUN ELECTIONS. 

331
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:53,919
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN 

332
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,753
PARTNER WITH THEM BUT 

333
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:55,755
ULTIMATELY IT'S THE STATE THAT 

334
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,655
HAS TO RUN IT. 

335
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:58,924
>> ALL RIGHT, SENATOR JAMES

THE STUDY BY A HARVARD 

352

DAUGHTERS OF WORKING MOMS ARE 

354
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,625
MORE LIKELY TO ADVANCE IN THEIR

356
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,260
IT ALSO FOUND THAT WHEN THE

CARING FOR THEM.
