FACEBOOK, I DON'T THINK WE NEED

47
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,060
TO THROW OUR NAME OUT, HER NAME

48
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:33,795
IS MELINDA, BUT I DON'T THINK WE

49
00:01:33,796 --> 00:01:36,331
NEED TO THROW HER NAME OUT TO

50
00:01:36,332 --> 00:01:36,731
THE MASSES.

51
00:01:36,732 --> 00:01:37,532
SHE ASSAULTED JOHN AND KNOW WE

FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS?

00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:49,144
>> NOT REALLY.

56
00:01:49,145 --> 00:01:51,479
IT'S KIND OF CRAZY, BECAUSE WE

57
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,184
DO KNOW SOME PROMINENT AND VERY

58
00:01:56,185 --> 00:01:59,721
AND THIS IS -- SHE WAS UPSET AT

59
00:01:59,722 --> 00:02:01,089
JOHN FOR FILMING HER RIPPING

60
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,124
THESE FLYERS BECAUSE WE ARE JUST

61
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,526

62
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:05,794
SHE WASN'T HAPPY WITH THAT AND

63
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:08,597
SHE ATTACKED HIM FOR IT.

64
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:16,938
>> Laura: SO WAS IT -- DOES HE

65
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:18,840
FACED MORE PUSHBACK JUST BECAUSE

66
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:21,509
OF HIS FAMILY LINEAGE?

67
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,844
>> I THINK PERHAPS BUT I THINK

68
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:26,381
THE REASON HE PUSHES -- HAS

69
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:27,315
PUSHBACK ANYWHERE IS BECAUSE

70
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:29,250
HE'S A CONSERVATIVE ON A COLLEGE

71
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:31,152
CAMPUS PROMOTING INDIVIDUAL

72
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:37,525
LIBERTY.

73
00:02:37,526 --> 00:02:38,927
THE STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO

74
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:39,294
CONFORM.

75
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:40,929
>> Laura: THEN, KEEP DOING

76
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,497
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING

77
00:02:42,498 --> 00:02:43,999
BECAUSE GUESS WHAT, THERE ARE A

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,333
LOT MORE STUDENTS THAT AGREE

79
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:46,034

80
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:47,636
FUN DOING IT AND YOU HAVE TO
