BORDER. A LIVE REPORT FROM ISRAEL COMING UP IN OUR NEXT HOUR. ANXIOUSLY? AINSLEY: THANK YOU, PETE. TENNESSEE VOTERS TURNING UP IN DROVES TO THE RALLY LAST NIGHT. PRESIDENT TRUMP STILL HAD A STRONG WARNING. IN NOVEMBER, WE WILL REVERSE A TREND. WHEN YOU WIN THE PRESIDENCY, FOR SOME REASON, YOU ALWAYS END UP LOSING THE HOUSE. YOU GET COMPLACENT. YOU WIN. AND NOW YOU SIT BACK AND YOU RELAX. THAT'S THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN. ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU HAVE ANOTHER ELECTION. AINSLEY: WHO SHOULD BE MORE WORRIED HEADED INTO THE MID TERMS IN ABOUT SIX MONTHS? HERE TO DEBATE IS G.O.P. POLSTER JUSTIN WALLEN AND JOEL PAIN. JUSTIN, I WILL START WITH YOU. DEMOCRATS NEED TO FLIP 23 SEAT. EXPERTS ARE SAYING THEY PREDICT THEY WILL FLIP ANYWHERE BETWEEN 25 AND 40 SEATS. KNOWING THAT INFORMATION, IT'S GOING TO BE VERY TOUGH. WHAT DO REPUBLICANS NEED TO DO? THIS ELECTION, JUST LIKE PRETTY MUCH ANY OTHER IS ABOUT ISSUES. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT PERSONALITIES. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE MISSTEPS THAT COULD HAPPEN ON EITHER THE DEMOCRATIC OR THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. I TEND TO SEE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. I DON'T SEE THE MESSAGING OR THE THEMES QUITE AS STRONG WHERE REPUBLICANS ARE STRONG IS THERE WERE TWO HUGE ISSUES LAST YEAR THAT NEED TO BE PUSHED FORWARD. ONE WAS TAX REFORM. THE OTHER WAS HEALTHCARE REFORM. FAILED WITH HEALTHCARE REFORM. SUCCEEDED WITH TAX REFORM. AND THE THIRD ISSUE, WHICH IS MUCH SMALLER IS INFRASTRUCTURE. IF SOMETHING CAN BE DONE WITH THAT AT LEAST REPUBLICANS CAN CLAIM OWNERSHIP. OWNERSHIP IS BIG RIGHT NOW. ACTION IS IMPORTANT. WE NEED TO SEE THAT IN ORDER FOR REPUBLICANS TO HAVE A CHANCE TO BUCK THE HISTORICAL TREND OF MID TERMS. AINSLEY: JOEL, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE REASON IS FOR DEMOCRATS IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S IN FAVOR OF THE DEMOCRATS. DEMOCRATS WILL TAKE THE HOUSE. WHEN YOU HAVE NANCY PELOSI SAYING I WANT TO INCREASE YOUR TAXES, I WANT OPEN BORDERS AND SUPPORTING MS-13 BACKING THEM, HOW DO THE DEMOCRATS WIN WITH THAT MESSAGE? THAT'S A NONSENSE WAY TO LAY OUT THE DEMOCRATIC AGENDA. AINSLEY: CORRECT ME THEN. HOW DO YOU LAY IT OUT. THAT'S NOT TRUE. AINSLEY: THAT IS TRUE. SHE HAS SAID THAT. THAT'S NOT. BUT WE CAN AGREE TO DISAGREE. AINSLEY: OKAY. THE PRESIDENT IT'S VERY INTERESTING THAT HE WAS EVEN IN TENNESSEE LAST NIGHT. I HAVE WORKED IN POLITICS. I WORKED FOR THE FORMER MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID. AND THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE EVEN IN TENNESSEE AS A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHAT, THREE OR FOUR MONTHS BEFORE ELECTION DAY DEFENDING A SEAT THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO DEFEND, A STATE THAT THE PRESIDENT WON WITH OVER 60% OF THE VOTE IN 2016, THAT SHOWS YOU HOW WEAK IS HE IN TENNESSEE. THAT SHOWS YOU HOW RUTTERLESS THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT IS IN TENNESSEE BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS PUT THEM IN THAT POSITION. BECAUSE IS HE FAILING IN TRUMP COUNTRY. REPUBLICANS ARE RUN AWAY FROM HIM. MARSHA BLACKBURN IS GOING TO HAVE TO CLING ON HOLD ON FOR DEAR LIFE TO HOLD ON TO THAT SEAT. I THINK THAT'S THE BIG STORY FROM LAST NIGHT THAT THE PRESIDENT EVEN HAD TO DEFEND THAT SEAT IN TENNESSEE LAST NIGHT. THAT'S "THE BIG STORY." AINSLEY: WELL, EVERY PRESIDENT HAS DONE, THIS RIGHT, JUSTIN? EVERY PRESIDENT GOES INTO AREAS WHERE THE RACES ARE TIGHT TO TRY TO RALLY THE TROOPS? YEAH. SURE. ONE OF THE FUNNY THINGS ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID LAST NIGHT IS WHO IS THE OPPONENT? I NEVER HEARD OF HIM. SUCCESSFUL GOVERNOR OF TENNESSEE. I MEAN, IF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WAS GOING TO PULL TOGETHER THE RIGHT CANDIDATE FOR THIS RACE THAT'S THE CANDIDATE. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S TIGHT. IT'S NOT BECAUSE TRUMP IS LOSING SUPPORT IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY FOR REPUBLICANS. I MEAN, THIS IS MARSHA BLACKBURN NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT TRUMP. HIS NUMBERS ARE DOWN BY 10 POINTS. ACTUALLY THEY HAVE BEEN CONTRACTING EVER SINCE FALL. HE IS UPSIDE DOWN. I MEAN, WE'RE NOT PRETENDING ABOUT ANYTHING. IS HE UPSIDE DOWN. BUT THEY ARE CONTRACTING. AND TRUMP IS SEEN AS, YOU KNOW, RELATIVELY INDEPENDENT. HE IS NOT NECESSARILY FULLY TIED TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THIS CAN BE A GOOD THING AND IT CAN BE A BAD THING. AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT I SAID EARLIER STILL STANDS. IT'S ABOUT ISSUES. AND IF BLACKBURN OWNS THE ISSUES THAT MATTER TO
