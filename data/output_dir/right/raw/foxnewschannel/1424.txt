1
00:00:00,876 --> 00:00:03,846
BILLS ONTO THE FLOOR, AND 213

2
00:00:03,846 --> 00:00:05,581
MEMBERS HAVE SIGNED ON SO FAR.

3
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:05,848
ED.

4
00:00:05,848 --> 00:00:07,750
>>  CHAD, THANKS FOR THAT

5
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,250
REPORT.

6
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,352
LET'S TALK TO CONGRESSMAN JEFF

7
00:00:10,352 --> 00:00:10,686
DENHAM.

8
00:00:10,686 --> 00:00:12,321
HE'S KIND ENOUGH TO JOIN US

9
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:15,824
LIVE, GIVE US THE INSIDE SCOOP

10
00:00:15,824 --> 00:00:19,528
OF WHERE THIS IMMIGRATION DEBATE

11
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:20,029
STANDS.

12
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:21,096
SOMETIMES YOU HEAR SOMETHING

13
00:00:21,096 --> 00:00:25,634
THAT JUST STOPS YOU IN YOUR

14
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:27,102
TRACKS.

15
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:28,470
NANCY PELOSI SAYING YOUR EFFORT

16
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:37,479
IS TO, "MAKE AMERICA WHITE

17
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:37,780
AGAIN.

18
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:37,963
SGLILT

19
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:38,547
SGLIL

20
00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:38,814
"

21
00:00:38,814 --> 00:00:39,882
>>YEAH, DISAPPOINTING TO HEAR.

22
00:00:39,882 --> 00:00:42,351
WE'VE GOT TO GET SOMETHING DONE.

23
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:43,285
THERE WERE MANY PROMISES MADE

24
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:45,587
LAST YEAR TO BRING UP A BILL.

25
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,023
THERE WAS CERTAINLY A DEADLINE

26
00:00:48,023 --> 00:00:50,926
THAT THE PRESIDENT IMPOSED.

27
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,695
AND CONGRESS FAILED TO ACT.

28
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:55,164
WE NEED BORDER SECURITY AND WE

29
00:00:55,164 --> 00:00:58,200
NEED TO FIX THIS ISSUE WITH

30
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,569
DREAMERS, HAVE A PERMANENT FIX.

31
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:01,603
WE ARE WORKING TO DO BOTH.

32
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,239
>>  LET'S GET OUR VIEWERS INSIDE

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,675
THE HUDDLE, IF YOU WILL.

34
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:08,977
BASICALLY, AS CHAD EXPLAINED, IF

35
00:01:08,977 --> 00:01:11,480
YOU CAN GET 218 PEOPLE TO SIGN

36
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,115
ONTO THIS, WHAT HAPPENS?

37
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,150
>>  SO 218 WILL FORCE A VOTE.

38
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,286
I'VE GOT 218.

39
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,054
I'VE ALWAYS HAD 218.

40
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:21,256
THERE HAS BEEN A PLAN IN PLACE.

41
00:01:21,256 --> 00:01:23,325
BUT REALLY THIS WAS SET UP AS A

42
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:25,661
RULE INITIALLY TO SHOW HOW MANY

43
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:27,029
REPUBLICANS WE COULD HAVE IN THE

44
00:01:27,029 --> 00:01:30,065
HOUSE AND HOW MUCH SUPPORT TO

45
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:31,567
REALLY GIVE THE SPEAKER --

46
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:32,368
EMPOWER THE SPEAKER TO BRING

47
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:32,835
SOMETHING UP.

48
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:35,371
WE DIDN'T DO THAT, SO WE DID THE

49
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:35,738
DISCHARGE.

50
00:01:35,738 --> 00:01:39,408
AND NOW WE'RE HAVING A VERY

51
00:01:39,408 --> 00:01:40,142
PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION WITH THE

52
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,510
FREEDOM CAUCUS AND HOUSE

53
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,178
LEADERSHIP TO HOPEFULLY COME TO

54
00:01:43,178 --> 00:01:44,213
A SOLUTION AS SOON AS WE GET

55
00:01:44,213 --> 00:01:44,513
BACK.

56
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:46,482
BUT WE HAVE THIS DISCHARGE

57
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:49,151
PETITION THAT WILL BRING UP FOUR

58
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,254
DIFFERENT BILLS.

59
00:01:52,254 --> 00:01:54,623
THE GOODLATTE BILL -- HE

60
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:56,225
DESERVES A VOTE.

61
00:01:56,225 --> 00:01:57,760
THE PRESIDENT DESERVES A VOTE.

62
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,195
THAT'S WHY PAUL RYAN HAS HIS OWN

63
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:00,763
BILL IN THIS.

64
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:04,566
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE THEIR CLEAN

65
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:05,634
DREAM ACT.

66
00:02:05,634 --> 00:02:09,538
AND THEN WE HAVE THE USA ACT.

67
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,206
>>  SO WE UNDERSTAND THE

68
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:11,607
PROCESS.

69
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:12,908
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS SOME OF

70
00:02:12,908 --> 00:02:14,943
YOUR FELLOW REPUBLICANS ARE

71
00:02:14,943 --> 00:02:17,446
SAYING THAT WHAT MAY END UP

72
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:21,049
HAVING IS MOST VOTES WILL GO TO

73
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:23,752
SAY THE DEMOCRATIC DREAM ACT.

74
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:25,320
BARACK OBAMA WENT AROUND TO

75
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,323
EVERYBODY AND UNILATERALLY

76
00:02:28,323 --> 00:02:31,427
DECIDED THAT THE CHILDREN OF

77
00:02:31,427 --> 00:02:33,228
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THAT ARE HERE

78
00:02:33,228 --> 00:02:40,869
IN THE UNITED STATES, UNION LAT

79
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,906
-- UNILATERALLY HE DECIDED THEY

80
00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:45,274
COULD STAY HERE.

81
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:48,243
YOU'LL WIND UP WITHOUT BORDER

82
00:02:48,243 --> 00:02:50,345
SECURITY BUT WITH MAKING DACA

83
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:52,347
CODIFIED INTO LAW.

84
00:02:52,347 --> 00:02:54,049
>>  CERTAINLY, IT'S

85
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,285
DISAPPOINTING TO HEAR THIS TYPE

86
00:02:56,285 --> 00:03:03,091
OF RHETORIC WHEN THE GOD  --

87
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:05,761
GOODLATTE BILL IS AN EXTENSION

88
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:08,964
OF WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA DID.

89
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:10,933
I WAS AGAINST THAT EXECUTIVE

90
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:11,233
ORDER.

91
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,968
I THINK CONGRESS HAS TO DO ITS

92
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:13,235
JOB.

93
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,370
BUT IN A BIPARTISAN BILL, WE ARE

94
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,474
GOING TO ACTUALLY HAVE A BORDER

95
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:20,809
SECURITY PIECE, CYBERSECURITY,

96
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:22,411
AND DEAL WITH THE CHAIN

97
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,513
MIGRATION THROUGH MORE JUDGES SO

98
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:25,848
WE HAVE DUE PROCESS VERY

99
00:03:25,848 --> 00:03:26,482
QUICKLY.

100
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:27,649
THE REAL DEBATE IS DO

101
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:28,684
REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY WANT TO

102
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:31,220
GIVE A PERMANENT FIX FOR

103
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,154
DREAMERS?

104
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:35,791
IF THEY DO A 10 TO 12-YEAR

105
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,626
PROCESS, SHOULD THEY BE ABLE TO

106
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:39,661
GET CITIZENSHIP?

107
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:42,331
>>  SO BOTTOM LINE, WILL THE

108
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:43,599
WALL BE INCLUDED?

109
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,867
THE PRESIDENT SAID IF THERE'S

110
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:47,503
NOT FUNDING FOR A REAL WALL,

111
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:49,338
SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL, HE'S NOT

112
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:51,607
GOING TO SIGN IT INTO LAW.

113
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:52,975
EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING WON'T

114
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:53,442
MATTER.

115
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,411
HE WON'T SIGN IT INTO LAW.

116
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:57,846
WILL THE FINAL PRODUCT HAVE

117
00:03:57,846 --> 00:03:58,981
FUNDING FOR THE WALL?

118
00:03:58,981 --> 00:03:59,515
>>  ABSOLUTELY.

119
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:01,350
THE FINAL PRODUCT WILL NOT ONLY

120
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,051
HAVE BORDER SECURITY MONEY IN IT

121
00:04:03,051 --> 00:04:05,854
FOR THE WALL, BUT IT WILL HAVE A

122
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:07,289
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.

123
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,790
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'LL GET A

124
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,658
FIX ON THIS.

125
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:11,693
AND ULTIMATELY THIS IS NOT JUST

126
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:13,095
FOR REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS.

127
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:14,129
THIS IS ACTUALLY FOR AMERICANS

128
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,130
TO FIND AN AMERICAN SOLUTION.

129
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,533
THAT MEANS SIGNING IT INTO LAW.

130
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:19,166
WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE

131
00:04:19,166 --> 00:00:00,000
PRESIDENT TO HAVE A BILL HE'LL
