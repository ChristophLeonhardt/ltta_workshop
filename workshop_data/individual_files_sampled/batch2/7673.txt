Blasi Ford and after he mocked her the crowd behind him was seen cheering and specifically laughing you could hear the crowd laughing as well and what stood out to me was part of dr. blah C's testimony though the one thing she said she remembers vividly about the alleged assault so let's take a look at what her testimony was both Fred and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack they seemed to be having a very good time indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter the lap the uproarious laughter between the two and they're having fun at my expense they were laughing with each other and you were the object of the laughter I was you know underneath one of them that while the two left to fret two friends having a really good time with one another so we heard that testimony I'm we're gonna play this video for you guys again so we they asked her so you were the object of their laughter and she said yes just a little while later Trump and in rally in Mississippi did this and in this case I want you to pay attention to the crowd so many different charges guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous for our country that's very dangerous for our culture shouldn't happen to him shouldn't happen to him what he's going through 36 years ago this happened I had one beer right I had one beer well you think was it nope that was one beer oh good how did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was it I don't know I don't know what neighborhood was it and I don't know where's the house at her upstairs downstairs where was I don't know but I had one beer that's the only thing I remember and a man's life is in tatters a man's life is shattered his wife has shattered his daughters who have beautiful incredible young kids they destroy people they want to destroy people these are really evil people Oh were you the object of their laughter yes so they laughed at her again and to see those women laughing to a hole see one of them holding up a woman for Trump sign and and me I mean look a lot of the guys you just saw the video yourself was smiling throughout and there's the little kid there Jesus man what is this country become even other Republicans Collins like saying appalling I mean bringing up this issue in a political rally for is a it's terrible to begin with let alone mocking the survivor and then having everybody laugh along you know I know that his rallies are a circus and that's what they like about him he's an entertainer I've explained this before he's he's basically the WWE entertainer and he creates characters and the CNN and the other guys are the bad guys but that everybody has fun and asked for autographs afterwards even over Kosta the CNN anchor etc but there's some things that shouldn't be entertainment and so this is a critique I have often of the conservatives they just think it's a game and I guess for them it is a fun game they have power they get rich there's if they have a lot of benefactors but politics isn't a game it affects people's lives so that's a real person Christine Blasi Ford and most Republicans acknowledge that what happened here was real not all of them obviously acknowledged that it was Kavanagh but you're gonna mock a sexual assault survivor like that and the crowds gonna go nuts I mean here we are back in Rome and and in the Coliseum and people are being fed to the Lions symbolically and the crowd is entertained gee I wonder why sexual assault victims don't come out and report it as soon as it happens we have one more Ford video that I want to show you again this is from her testimony at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing I believed he was going to rape me I tried to yell for help when I did Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from yelling this is what terrified me the most and has had the most lasting impact on my life it was hard for me to breathe and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me somewhere Corey lewandowski's saying womp womp and the Republican Party if you still stand by these people you know it's one thing if you were scammed into voting for Trump during the election but if after all this you still support them she embarrass me like you make me embarrassed to be an American and and that's the overwhelming feel like a feeling I got today man the guy this is a sick guy and and unfortunately well I was just saying more people voted for him they didn't but it did he won the election either way and and tens of millions of fellow Americans voted for him enough for him to win and so what does this say about us not just Trump not just the people at that rally not just as his voters but about us and about humanity that we're willing let a monster like this be our leader because we're a little entertained the TYT Plus app is now available on iOS and Android download to get more TYT content at TYT comm slash app
