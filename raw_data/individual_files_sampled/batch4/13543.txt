the fourth of July is on the way that's the day we commemorate the start of the greatest nation in the world ever to create a generation of young people who think it's the worst nation in the world that's right after nearly two and a half centuries of an America that has produced unprecedented peace wealth science health freedom and equality we are now being condemned by the youngsters who created man buns and duck face selfies sure the young folks say when the founding fathers declared their independence from England on July 4th 1776 they were risking their lives to establish a new creed of Liberty that contained the Distilled political wisdom of humankind but could they binge-watch Big Bang Theory while texting emojis and painting their toenails with sparkles at the same time I don't think so the founding fathers included genius inventors and philosophers as well as international statesmen heroes soldiers and generals but they were all white men why admire them when you are surrounded by rainbow colored people of indeterminate gender who know how to make a loud renoise to protest white supremacy patriarchy and smallpox three things that no longer exist largely because of Americans but if there's one thing young people know it's that America is bad because it doesn't have a big enough government look at socialist countries like Cuba and Venezuela where you have free health care so if you get injured at a food riot you can go directly to an abandoned hospital building and get Michael Moore's autograph for absolutely no cost except your freedom and dignity here in rotten America because of all the slaveholding Indian killing worker exploiting capitalist patriarchal white men with smallpox you have to actually pay doctors for curing you before you send a text to have a three-course meal delivered direct to your dorm room so you don't have to interrupt your conversation about how awful America is because of July 4th American ideals creativity and prosperity have lifted the entire world to new levels of freedom and happiness but that was so unfair to those cultures that were marginalized simply because they were different wanted to remain in the Middle Ages where they could enslave and slaughter people and what about American women look how oppressed they are I would even say that American women had no voice except how would I then explain that loud whining noise coming from some of the most privileged and powerful females on the planet so as we approach this July 4th young people find themselves on the horns of a dilemma should they celebrate and memorialize the never-before-seen accomplishments of a nation more powerful peaceful and free than any that has ever existed or should they sit around in their parents basements and talk about how woke they are my suggestion try to contribute something to the beautiful culture you're privileged to find yourself in or conversely put a sock in your mouth which would be a contribution in and of itself trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show just to get even whispers a win we also say Nina she sits atop see the roses if anything it's a wonderful all right we are back in an unidentified bunker that we will be continuing to use until we have an actual studio which is being built I can see it out the window I can see the chocolate champagne fountains some of the naked dance entirely naked dancing girls amazing and elephants on parade that do tricks and everything that will be in there within a couple of weeks but now we're in this crummy little dive with the funny lamps from the no-tell motel behind me but but tomorrow is the mailbag day and I know what some of you are thinking you were thinking Oh only one more day and this miserable excuse for human

so let's talk about how much the media sucks okay we're talking about this you know we talk about the media lot and I want to explain why I hate them so much I've got a preview video coming out on Thursday or Friday I think it drops and it's about fake news and it's about the fact that it's not this story of that story this fake news it's it's the whole way the news is reported in most of the mainstream media in America and I think that that is the thing that we're looking at as we see the CNN scandal explode it's not just CNN it is one it's one CNN scandal left or another really it's not just CNN CNN is at the forefront there being caught out and they're being tripped up but it's all of them it's ABC CBS NBC News all the news departments and it's the New York Times and it's the Washington Post I want to talk about why it matters why what it has done to our country to have the news so one side isn't so corrupt and you know it's not that these people are bad people it really isn't it's that when you surround yourself with people only with people who agree with you after a while you become radicalized after a while you begin to think that this is the only way that people think and this is why we keep having the hilarious spectacle of these polls that come out and tell everybody oh the Democrats are going to win the Democrats is going to be a landslide and then suddenly we get to watch people on CNN with their faces falling as the shock of reality comes in like smoke like gas leaking under the door the reality comes in the sealed environment and suddenly they realized that they've just been talking to themselves not only is nobody watching them nobody believes them and why does nobody believe them because when you are sequestered among people only people who agree with you you start to make mistakes so three prominent journalists as CNN resigned on Monday after the cable news network was forced to retract and apologized for a story on its website involving a close ally of President Trump the article linking Anthony scaramouche II a hedge fund manager and Trump confidant to a Russian investment fund supposedly being investigated by the Senate was removed from cnn.com late last week after the network decided it could not fully stand by its reporting and after they were caught out online by people pointing out that the whole thing was ridiculous they had one anonymous source and they went with it completely against any standards of journalism frankly I think you should have to have a named source before you go with it's very rare that anonymous sources can be trusted not because sometimes they're not telling the truth but you never know when they're telling the truth and the reader or the viewer never notes the resignation is this is from the New York Times or a platformer newspaper are a black eye of a sensitive moment for the news organization which has a urghhh as a regular target of mr. Trump and his supporters the president relishes dismissing the network's coverage as fake news and his closest advisors have accused the channel of harboring a bias against mr. Trump well guess what we no longer have to accuse them we no longer have to suspect them now we know because our friends at Project Veritas have got suspended again they have gone in and sent a underground reporter as is their want and have exposed what they're doing this is James O'Keefe of course at Project Veritas extent in a an undercover reporter and he got this guy John Bonney field a supervisor and producer to talk about the way this station is run under Jeff Zucker and has been run for ever and you know well it we're going to play some of these takes I mean it is really worth looking at they have this hidden camera expose now remember this thing that happened to CNN this is the latest thing that has happened but remember there was Kathy Griffin who held up the severed head of Donald Trump and had to be fired for that there was a Reza Aslan who started to say all that filth you know spew filth on Twitter about Donald Trump and there was also that story where they where they said that James Comey in his testimony before Congress was going to say that it was inaccurate what Donald Trump had said that three times he had told me wasn't an under investigation in fact James Comey possibly inspired by Trump's threat of there being tapes was forced to say in fact that he had told Donald Trump three separate times that there was no investigation which has left this Russia story completely in the lurch and made all the ancillary investigations look utterly utterly ridiculous so let's take a look at some of this project Veritas stuff that O'Keefe has come up with all right first of all we have the guy this is John Bonney field CNN supervising producer and he's talking about liberal bias this is cut number three I think the arrows oddly liberal in want to be Trump really get scrutinize and I think if we would behave that way with President Obama and scrutinized everything that he was doing with the money we applied to Donald Trump and gardeners would have concern I think they would think we were attacking our viewers right now and I'm not thankful of our keepers are we or I think there's a lot of the trumpet for hurt that's a head okay now the problem with this I mean is that of course it's true that now cNN has liberal viewers but where did they come from you think conservatives wouldn't watch a fair news station of course they would you know they watch Fox News because it's the only station where they can hear themselves represented at all in a fair and balanced manner but they they would go to CNN you know MSNBC is hiring Hugh Hewitt and apparently their viewers are going crazy but MSNBC sees an opening this is a business opening because Fox News is floundering and so CMS so MSNBC is bringing in Hugh Hewitt is a wonderful conservative commentator and they gave him I think a Saturday morning show and of course their viewers like you know burst a blood-vessel but if in fact they were to become a balanced station with conservative and liberal views maybe their audience would expand maybe people's minds would expand maybe they would learn something the thing is the viewers the super liberal viewers the bond of field is talking about it CNN they came second to the bias of the station people stopped watching CNN because they were biased and now the only people there are the people who are having their biases confirmed so now their business model right their business model has to serve the people that are the only audience it's the only audience left the only audience left is the Liberals because they're liberals and so now they have to serve the Liberals and it's this spiral you get more and more and more liberal until finally you're just talking to yourself here is money field goes on talking about you know you learn about ethics in school but now we've got this business model we're fighting for our lives and so we just have to feed the beast is cut to all the night a little ethics they get talked about in journals that's adorable horrible especially cable you know cable News's New York Times that it's not it's not even like NBC News it's it I mean NBC News bill it's 20 million do versa night cable minutes was getting a billion so like they got they got to do what they got to do to make their money thing and so I love that I love the news business but I I find it so very cynical about it at the same time so remotes my comment probably not alone so you know I want to point out to that is there's a very specific kind of news media that I personally go after my friends at at News Buster's which I love when my favorite sites MRC the media Research Council I think it is that I just love their stuff but a lot of times they go after MSNBC and I've always whenever I talk to them I always say don't go after them they're an honest broker of left-wing news they give you left-wing commentary nobody goes to Rachel Maddow and thinks I'm going to get it fair and balanced you go to Rachel Maddow for the same reason you go to Sean Hannity to get their opinions on which are going to be on format out of the left and Hannity on the right you know what you're getting they're not is nothing dishonest about that there's nothing dishonest about that as long as they're talking about the facts and they're not making facts up you know sometimes they go astray and their vigor and their verb to get the opposition I don't like what Hannity is doing with the set the rich thing I unless he has information that I haven't seen he really should let that go but still still he's an honest guy he says I am a right winger here is my right-wing opinion Rachel Maddow honest I'm a left winger here's my left-wing opinion CNN the New York Times the network's Washington Post they pretend that they are the voice of truth they speak in that you know old-fashioned newsy voice this is the news this is the news and they are lying and they're not just lying in some small level where there's some level of bias where the reporter is biased and you know he's biased it is very very difficult now to pick up the New York Times and find the facts of the story there is actually now a profession that we here at the Daily wire are in of sifting through what the New York Times and all these other people say because they have the resources to send out reporters into the field which a lot of websites don't have of sifting through that information and trying to figure out what the real story is hey I want to mention again because we're gonna have to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube I want to mention again that it's mailbag tomorrow so come on over to the daily wire comm and subscribe and I do want to say before you go you know I just noticed before coming on the air that pop set like that which is Laura engrams Laure Ingram's website life set it has a part of pop culture called pop set has an article today called for podcast truly worth your time it includes Adam Carolla and Joe Rogan and it includes this guy the show you are listening to right this minute it says the podcast from novelist and conservative Andrew Clayman is the most political on this list but it's the creativity and thought he puts into his daily wire show that makes it stand apart from the others at Zachary Lehman clearly he doesn't listen to the show and he drinks but aside from that that's very complimentary and so this is what you get you will get if you come over to the daily wire.com and subscribe
