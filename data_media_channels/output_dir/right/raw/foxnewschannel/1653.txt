BRIAN: ALL RIGHT.

6
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:08,654
MANY IN THE MEDIA HAVE A

7
00:00:08,654 --> 00:00:10,022
NEW -- FEEL AS THOUGH THERE

8
00:00:10,022 --> 00:00:11,790
IS A NEW MEDIA DARLING OUT

9
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,090
THERE.

10
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,059
A NEW REPORT FINDS THAT

11
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:15,927
STORMY DANIELS ATTORNEY

12
00:00:15,927 --> 00:00:17,295
MICHAEL AVENATTI HAS

13
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:19,898
APPEARED ON CNN 74 TIMES IN

14
00:00:19,898 --> 00:00:22,034
JUST 10 WEEKS.

15
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:22,567
ABBY: UNBELIEVABLE.

16
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:24,703
HERE WITH HIS REACTION WHITE

17
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:26,371
HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY ARI

18
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:26,772
FLEISCHER.

19
00:00:26,772 --> 00:00:27,739
A CNN CONTRIBUTOR AT THIS

20
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:28,040
POINT.

21
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,007
>> I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE

22
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:30,442
PROMPT UNDERNEATH HIM SAYS,

23
00:00:30,442 --> 00:00:30,742
RIGHT?

24
00:00:30,742 --> 00:00:31,610
>> YOU COMPARE HIM TO THE

25
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,310
NUMBER OF TIMES THAT

26
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,345
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ON CNN

27
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:34,546
BEFORE HE WAS PRESIDENT, I

28
00:00:34,546 --> 00:00:35,914
THINK IT WAS LIKE 30.

29
00:00:35,914 --> 00:00:36,782
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

30
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:38,383
>> WELL, HERE'S THE THING,

31
00:00:38,383 --> 00:00:38,684
LOOK.

32
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:40,218
WE HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE TO

33
00:00:40,218 --> 00:00:41,887
A SMALLER DEGREE, LAWYERS

34
00:00:41,887 --> 00:00:42,921
COME, LAWYERS GO AND THEY

35
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:44,990
TRY TO GET ON TV AS MUCH AS

36
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,357
THEY CAN.

37
00:00:45,357 --> 00:00:46,224
IN THIS CASE I DON'T SEE

38
00:00:46,224 --> 00:00:47,526
WHAT THE LAWYERING IS.

39
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:48,960
HE COMES ACROSS MUCH MORE AS

40
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,661
A POLITICAL OPERATIVE.

41
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:50,962
IF THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO

42
00:00:50,962 --> 00:00:52,330
DO HE IS ENTITLED TO DO THAT

43
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,532
BUT HIS CLIENT, SHE ALREADY

44
00:00:53,532 --> 00:00:55,767
GOT THE 130,000 AND SPILLED

45
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:56,535
THE BEANS.

46
00:00:56,535 --> 00:00:57,536
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LEGAL

47
00:00:57,536 --> 00:00:58,537
ISSUES ARE THAT HE IS

48
00:00:58,537 --> 00:00:59,538
REPRESENTING OTHER THAN HE

49
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:01,440
WANTS TO TAKE DONALD TRUMP

50
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,807
DOWN.

51
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:02,507
STEVE: FORGET ABOUT THE FACT

52
00:01:02,507 --> 00:01:03,608
THAT HE IS ON THE CHANNEL.

53
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:06,278
CLEERLG THE

54
00:01:06,278 --> 00:01:06,344
CLEARLG THE

55
00:01:06,344 --> 00:01:07,379
CLEARLY THE CHANNEL SIN

56
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:07,846
VARIETYING HIM.

57
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:09,815
>> THIS IS THE BIGGER ISSUE

58
00:01:09,815 --> 00:01:12,017
WITH JOURNALISM TODAY CNN

59
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:14,186
AND MSNBC HAVE BECOME

60
00:01:14,186 --> 00:01:15,387
OPTIONAL NOT FACTUAL.

61
00:01:15,387 --> 00:01:17,089
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS

62
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:18,190
THE JOURNALISM IS NOT

63
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:18,523
WINNING.

64
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:19,858
MANY PEOPLE TRUST FOX.

65
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:21,159
MANY PEOPLE DON'T.

66
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,427
MANY PEOPLE DON'T TRUST CNN

67
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:26,531
AND NTSB.

68
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:28,633
THEY ARE PUTTING HIM ON WITH

69
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:29,801
POLITICAL ADVOCATE.

70
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:30,736
FREQUENCY HOW ASTOUNDING

71
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:32,104
THEY WANT HIM.

72
00:01:32,104 --> 00:01:33,438
BRIAN: HE HAS EXTREMELY THIN

73
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:34,406
SKIN.

74
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:35,474
EVIDENTLY HE THREATENED TO

75
00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:36,441
SUE THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER

76
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:37,609
FOR A NEGATIVE STORY.

77
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:38,844
FOX NEWS CONFIRMED THE STATE

78
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:40,312
BAR OF CALIFORNIA

79
00:01:40,312 --> 00:01:41,079
INVESTIGATING HIM.

80
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,280
THEY ARE LOOKING INTO HIS

81
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,781
BANKRUPTCY, TOO.

82
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:43,648
THEY ARE ALSO INVESTIGATING

83
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:46,184
HIM REGARDING ALLEGED UNPAID

84
00:01:46,184 --> 00:01:46,952
TAXES.

85
00:01:46,952 --> 00:01:48,453
SO HE IS STARTING TO SEE THE

86
00:01:48,453 --> 00:01:50,288
OTHER SIDE OF BEING THE

87
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:51,656
MEDIA DARLING.

88
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:52,958
THEY FIND OUT WHERE IS HE

89
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:53,258
FROM?

90
00:01:53,258 --> 00:01:54,126
WHAT HAS HE DONE?

91
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:56,161
BOTTOM LINE IS MOST OF HIS

92
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:57,062
CLIENTS ARE DEMOCRATIC

93
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:57,462
OPERATIVES.

94
00:01:57,462 --> 00:01:58,230
>> ALL TRUE.

95
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,297
THIS IS THE REASON I THINK

96
00:01:59,297 --> 00:02:01,166
HE GOES ON TV BECAUSE HE

97
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,367
ENJOYS BEING MORE THE

98
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:03,702
POLITICAL OPERATIVE THAN THE

99
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:04,736
COUNSEL REPRESENTING A

100
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:05,070
CLIENT.

101
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,938
HERE'S THE THING, HE IS A

102
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:07,539
SIDE SHOW.

103
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:09,374
THE REAL LAWYER HERE IS BOB

104
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:09,708
MUELLER.

105
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:10,308
THE REAL ISSUE THAT THE

106
00:02:10,308 --> 00:02:11,777
WHITE HOUSE DEALS WITH IS

107
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:12,210
BOB MUELLER.

108
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:12,944
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

109
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:14,312
MICHAEL COHEN AND WITH

110
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:15,881
MICHAEL AVENATTI IS A SIDE

111
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:16,181
SHOW.

112
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:17,849
THIS IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE

113
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:18,984
TRUMP PRESIDENCY IN ANY

114
00:02:18,984 --> 00:02:20,252
SERIOUS LEGAL OR POLITICAL

115
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:20,519
WAY.

116
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:21,987
AND SO I HAVE NEVER SEEN

117
00:02:21,987 --> 00:02:24,256
SOMEBODY WHO IS A SIDE SHOW

118
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:28,627
GET SO MUCH TV.

119
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:29,261
ABBY: PRESIDENT EVERY WAY

120
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:30,595
WHEN IT COMES TO THE STORMY

121
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:31,196
DANIELS SITUATION.

122
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:33,265
WITH YOUR EXPERTISE WOULD

123
00:02:33,265 --> 00:02:35,066
YOU ADVISE HIM TO DO STAY

124
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:36,334
AWAY OR NOT TOUCH THIS.

125
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:37,169
>> IGNORE HIM.

126
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:38,203
HE IS THE SIDE SHOW.

127
00:02:38,203 --> 00:02:39,371
THE ONLY THREAT TO THE WHITE

128
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:40,472
HOUSE IS BOB MUELLER.

129
00:02:40,472 --> 00:02:41,640
THAT'S A RECEDING THREAT

130
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,474
FRANKLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO

131
00:02:42,474 --> 00:02:44,776
EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION ISSUE

132
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:45,143
ANYWHERE.

133
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:45,811
FOCUS ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT

134
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:48,580
AND THE THINGS THAT ARE THE

135
00:02:48,713 --> 00:02:50,882
SIDE SHOWS AND PROBABLY THE

136
00:02:50,882 --> 00:02:53,385
MOST PAINFUL THING FOR YOU

137
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:54,653
WILL AVENATTI IS TO BE

138
00:02:54,653 --> 00:00:00,000
TREATED AS THE SIDE SHOW HE
