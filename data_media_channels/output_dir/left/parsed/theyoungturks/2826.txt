RIGHT NOW THE WHITE HOUSE IS
CONSIDERING LAUNCHING A
PREEMPTIVE ATTACK ON
NORTH KOREA.
BUT DON'T WORRY, WE'RE PRETTY
SURE IT WON'T LEAD TO A
NUCLEAR APOCALYPSE.
THAT IS THE RHETORIC THEY ARE
USING TO DEFEND THIS PLAN.
UNFORTUNATELY THAT COULD BE
FOLLOWED BY THE PRICE WE CAN ALL
PAY FOR THE WHITE HOUSE'S
BEHAVIOR.
SO THEY WANT TO USE THE PRETEXT
OF SOME SORT OF TEST TO ATTACK
NORTH KOREA AND THE GAMBLE IS
THAT HE WILL NOT RESPOND IN THE
WAY THAT YOU MIGHT THINK
HE MIGHT.
CERTAINLY STATEMENTS FROM THE
NORTH KOREAN REGIME IMPLY THAT
ANY SORT OF ATTACK WILL BE
INTERPRETED AS WAR, AND THAT
COULD HAVE TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES.
LET'S GO OVER SOME
NUMBERS REAL FAST.
IN MANY CASES AREAS HAVE BEEN ñ
YOU DON'T NEED ANY MISSILES OR
NUKES.
THEY CAN REIGN HOW LONG THE SOUL
AND KILL HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN A
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.
THE ALSO PREDICTED COULD
EVENTUALLY BRING CHINA, RUSSIA,
AND JAPAN INTO THE MIX WHICH
WOULD HAVE HUGE ADDITIONAL
NUMBERS OF CASUALTIES.
THAT IS IF THERE IS NO
NUCLEAR RESPONSE.
THEY ARE SAYING THEY WILL
RESPOND.
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
THIS WOULD ACCOMPLISH?
I KNOW IN
TRUMP'S MIND HE THINKS THIS WILL
SCARE NORTH KOREA OFF.
IT WILL DE-ESCALATE THE
SITUATION SOMEHOW, BUT I DON'T
THINK THAT IS THE CASE.
IT DOESN'T SEEM AS THOUGH KIM
JONG UN IS COMPLETELY
UNAWARE.
I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A POINT
ABOUT HOW ALL OF THE MEDIA.
THEY MAKE IT SEEM AS A TRUMPET
SITTING THERE HAVING
NEGOTIATIONS WITH MATTIS, HR
MCMASTER AND TILLER SEND.
WE TALKED ABOUT HIS SCHEDULE
YESTERDAY, HE IS NOT IN THE
NITTY-GRITTY OF THE SITUATION.
MY FEAR IS THAT HE WILL MAKE AN
UNEDUCATED, UNINFORMED DECISION
THAT COULD LEAD TO A LOT OF
PEOPLE LOSING THEIR LIVES.
I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO
ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING.
ONE OF THE COMMENTATORS I READ
SAID IT WOULD REALLY HARM KIM
JONG UN'S UNDERSTANDING ñ
IS INTERNATIONAL STANDING.
LIKE THAT HIS STANDING, PEOPLE
TAKING HIM SERIOUSLY AS A
RESULT OF TRUMP CARRYING OUT
THIS ATTACK.
DEFINITELY.
WHAT HE HAS TO EXERT INFLUENCE
IS THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE.
IF HE'S GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO
USE IT AND CHOOSES NOT TO,
DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE COULD IN
THE FUTURE BUT HE WOULD LOSE
SOME OF THAT THREATENING
PRESENCE.
IF HE CHOOSES TO RESPOND TO IT
IT DOES LEAD TO ALL-OUT WAR, HE
WILL LIKELY DIE ALONG WITH MOST
OF THE PEOPLE IN NORTH KOREA.
THE TIMING OF ALL OF THIS
SEEMS STRANGE.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
THEY READ A BOOK.
THIS IS THE KIND OF DESTRUCTION
THAT 
PRESIDENTS HAVE DONE TO
KEEP YOUR MIND OFF OF WHAT
IS HAPPENING.
YOU ARE RIGHT.
THAT'S WHY MEANT WHEN I SAID
STRANGE.
AND REMEMBER THIS IS
HAPPENING WHILE NORTH KOREA AND
SOUTH KOREA ARE FINALLY TALKING
AND NEGOTIATING WITH ONE
ANOTHER.
LATER ON WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW
NORTH KOREA IS GOING TO SEND
SOME OF ITS ATHLETES TO SOUTH
KOREA FOR THE OLYMPICS, AND
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN TRUMP
COMES OUT WITH THIS.
THE COUNTRIES YOU MENTIONED,
RUSSIA, CHINA, THEY DIDN'T
MENTION JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA.
SOUTH KOREA HAS THE MOST TO
LOSE, WITH THE FIRST DIRECT
RESPONSE WOULD COME.
I THINK THE IMPLIED IDEA IS
THAT IN ADDITION CHINA,
RUSSIA, AND JAPAN COULD BE
BROUGHT IN.
WE DON'T HAVE AN AMBASSADOR
TO SOUTH KOREA OR ANYONE WHO CAN
CALL UP AND GET ON THE STATE
DEPARTMENT PHONE AND TELL REX
TILLERSON I KNOW YOU ARE NOT
PUSHING FOR THIS BUT YOU HAVE TO
STOP THIS BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT
IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
WE ARE WOEFULLY UNDERMANNED AND
UNDER WOMANED IN THE STATE
DEPARTMENT ON ANOTHER PART THAT
IS UNDER DISCUSSED IS WHAT IT
MEANS ABOUT THE WAY HE IS
GETTING HIS INFORMATION.
WE SHOULD NOT KNOW THAT MCMASTER
AND TILLERSON SAYING THIS.
IT IS LIKELY ONE OF THOSE THREE.
FORGET WHO THE PRESIDENT IS
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS
TERRIBLE.
BASICALLY I THINK THIS IS A
GREAT CASE STUDY FOR WHAT WAS
REVEALED IN FIRE AND FURY AND
HOW THEY ACTUAL OPERATE.
HE IS NOT A PERSON WITH
LOTS OF HIS OWN.
YOU GET THESE FACTIONS THAT ARE
DUKING IT OUT, ALL OF THEM
USING LEAKING AT VARIOUS POINTS
TO ADVANCE THEIR AGENDA.
IT COULD BE THAT HR MCMASTER
IS LEAKING THIS.
TO GIVE THE VIEW THAT IT IS A
SERIOUS WHITE HOUSE OR IT COULD
BE THAT REX TILLERSON OR MATTIS
COULD BE LEAKING THIS TO GET
PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION SO HE
WILL BACK OFF.
VERY OFTEN TRUMPETERS HAVE THE
CYCLICAL SORT OF THOUGHTS AND
BRING SOMETHING UP BECAUSE
HE'S FRUSTRATED.
AND THEY PROBABLY HAVE BEEN
ATTEMPTING TO DISSUADE HIM
FROM STARTING A NUCLEAR
HOLOCAUST.
THEY COULD BE THIS IS THE MOST
RECENT WAY TO TRY TO STEP HIM
OFF OF THAT.
IS IT LIKELY THAT ON ANY GIVEN
DAY HE WILL LAUNCH AN ATTACK?
PERHAPS NOT.
BUT WE KNOW THAT HE CAN BE
SPARKED BY SOMETHING.
IF TOMORROW NORTH KOREA TEST
ANOTHER MISSILE, MAYBE THAT
WILL CAUSE THEM TO WANT
TO ATTACK.
IS POSSIBLE IT IS JUST A
DISTRACTION AND MAYBE WE SPENT
TOO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT, BUT
IT IS A TOPIC IN WHICH HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES
ARE ON THE LINE.
IT IS ALSO TERRIFYING TO KNOW
THAT THIS IS EITHER IN THE BACK
OF THE FRONT OF TRUMP'S MIND AND
IF THERE IS ANY PROVOCATION
FROM NORTH KOREA THIS IS A
POSSIBILITY.
WE ARE DEALING WITH TWO
COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT
RATIONAL ACTORS.
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY THAT
ABOUT THE UNITED STATES
PRESIDENT, BUT HE IS NOT A
RATIONAL ACTOR.
THE FORMER CEO OF EXXON CAN
TALK SENSE INTO HIM I HOPE.
