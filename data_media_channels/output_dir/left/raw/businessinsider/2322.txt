1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,750
Andrew what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is peak oil and what does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,330
mean yeah Peak Oil is essentially the

3
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,029
point at which<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stops being</font>

4
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,760
able to increase its usage at first rate

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,039
of usage of oil<font color="#E5E5E5"> and gas you know peak</font>

6
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,990
oil in my mind is essentially an

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,250
inventory measure what were you going to

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,320
put in the numerator a total amount of

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,660
barrels that the world has and how many

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">other rate that the the global uses oil</font>

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">and gas supplies and you know the actual</font>

12
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:41,370
initial work that what kind of is

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,770
credited mostly it was done by each king

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hubbert at Shell Oil back and I believe</font>

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,300
in 1960s and at the time he correctly

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,129
predicted the peak in US oil production

17
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,379
and using<font color="#E5E5E5"> his data a lot of folks</font>

18
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,820
thought that the peak and US oil

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,239
production was going to happen in a 2004

20
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,850
2009 time period of course it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,949
take a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years beyond that</font>

22
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,329
period for us to really assess if it

23
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,510
truly happened but fundamentally you

24
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,070
know we have two ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Peak</font>

25
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oil one is to add new resources which</font>

26
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,420
we've done through shale gas to shale

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,450
oil through you know potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,189
new deposits in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Gulf of Mexico and</font>

29
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,670
then on the denominator side excuse me

30
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,130
or we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> change is how quickly we use</font>

31
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,409
it and that comes where that's where

32
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,930
conservation carpooling and other such

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,720
kind of measures can help us out so how

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,159
those to balance that will open<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,229
determine when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Peak Oil occurs and I</font>

36
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,420
think right now we're right in the

37
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">middle of that assessment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so given</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,549
it's been on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the minds of people for the</font>

39
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,500
last four years is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's</font>

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,360
imminent or looming is it something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,030
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really need to plan for our</font>

42
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,070
governments around the world absolutely

43
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,220
I mean it's no one wants to wake up and

44
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,540
find<font color="#CCCCCC"> that before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly so that in my</font>

45
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">mind that's where we're going to see</font>

46
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,829
additional alternative resources come to

47
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,060
the forefront of course over last you

48
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,500
know couple generations has been nuclear

49
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,270
we've had hydro for a while you know we

50
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,729
had we've got a lot of coal you know the

51
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,739
question is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we scale up those</font>

52
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:11,390
additional

53
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,569
sources particularly solar hydro kind of

54
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,760
nuclear to kind of do it safely<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

55
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,250
sustainably so given<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that a lot</font>

56
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people think this should be a risk</font>

57
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,069
management scenario what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing or</font>

58
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:27,680
what's the estimated economic impact is

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that can you even quantify that oh there</font>

60
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,320
are probably a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more savvy economists</font>

61
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,720
out there that have an estimate on the

62
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">impact of switching to alternative fuels</font>

63
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,850
and that's sadly that's outside my

64
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,940
bailiwick there seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a dearth of</font>

65
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,550
case studies or programs dedicated to

66
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,380
what happens if when this actually

67
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,989
occurs should there<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more business</font>

68
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:54,170
school studies expansion of what we're

69
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,840
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> or is that going to solar going to</font>

70
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,900
grid are those the alternative ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow</font>

71
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,190
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will have to have a</font>

72
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,200
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possibilities you</font>

73
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,790
know a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

74
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,950
ethanol was a very big idea and of

75
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,330
course Brazil as i understand it has a

76
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,120
lot of ethanol supplies to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US you</font>

77
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">know given that the first presidential</font>

78
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,540
primary happens in Iowa you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we'll</font>

79
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,519
probably have corn based ethanol for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

80
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,850
while however it's it's going to take

81
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,950
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a generation or more for us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

82
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,540
determine<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether all these different</font>

83
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,760
ideas can actually be sustainable and

84
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,459
the scaled up to the size<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will need</font>

85
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:33,049
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it you know I have a meaningful</font>

86
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:35,360
impact on the overall use of energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

87
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,400
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> the depletion globally should the</font>

88
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,430
u.s. be more focused on our oil reserves

89
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,730
or what we can do as alternative energy

90
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,820
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of bringing it in house yeah</font>

91
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,160
certainly you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I think shale gas has</font>

92
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,230
has has helped kind of open people's

93
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,780
eyes that that possibility is there the

94
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,880
US for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most part is self-sustaining</font>

95
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,680
or North America self-sustaining on

96
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,870
natural gas side you know we import some

97
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">LNG from from outside North America but</font>

98
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,610
it's it's maybe ten percent of usage on

99
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,230
a daily basis whereas an oil side we're

100
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,299
importing you know I think sixty percent

101
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:10,910
or more of our oil usage so you know

102
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's jail gas is probably our best</font>

103
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:14,989
opportunity in the short term to kind of

104
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:17,089
alleviate those needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course then</font>

105
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,680
finding some ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get natural gas</font>

106
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,570
into the transportation infrastructure I

107
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,240
mean at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time oil is primarily a</font>

108
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,670
transfer

109
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,100
fuel<font color="#E5E5E5"> and gas and coal are primarily</font>

110
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,570
power fuels we have to find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to</font>

111
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of create that BTU parity great</font>

112
00:04:29,940 --> 00:00:00,000
thank you Andrew thank you
