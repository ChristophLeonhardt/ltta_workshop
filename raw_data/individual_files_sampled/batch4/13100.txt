at the Grammys on Sunday a great crime against humanity occurred with the entire world watching Adele won the top Grammy leaving Beyonce the greatest human being who has ever graced our planet out in the cold again why why God why race for them never mind that Adele's 25 was the top-selling album of the year while Beyonce's lemonade showed up at number 4 Adele had to apologize to Beyonce for winning the album of the year and then she split her Grammy in half and said quote I can't possibly accept this award the lemonade album was just so monumental yes lemonade his groundbreaking Beethoven asked a work of heartbreaking genius with which only heaven or heavens angel could have seen fit to grace us who else but Queen P could have given us these mortal lines y'all haters corny with dat illuminati mess paparazzi catch my fly and my cocky fresh the echoes of shakespeare ring in every romantic lyric so why would an artist of colour naturally assume that adult victory at the Grammys represents a new form of Jim Crow here's the New York Times quote before the 59th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday the music industry murmured about what it might mean for adults once again sweep the top awards leaving Beyonce snubbed in the major categories and with her third loss for album of the year having long faced accusations that the Grammys overlooked young progressive black artists the last woman to win Album of the year with Lauryn Hill in 1999 The Recording Academy faced a potential backlash for going all-in on a white traditionalist choice like Adele in the last five years especially albums by Frank Ocean mr. Lamar and Beyonce have been passed over for the top award in favor of releases by white artist Mumford & Sons Daft Punk Beck Taylor Swift and Adele so now the Grammys are just another repository of white racism but it's not enough that everyone in the music industry must pay tribute to Beyonce it's not enough for the top-selling artist on the planet to bow before Beyonce as required under international law no a Grammys must be boycotted until they recognise that incredibly rich incredibly beautiful world famous black people have to win awards otherwise they are just Bull Connor does anyone wonder why our culture is falling apart why the social fabric is fraying we can't even listen to music or watch a silly music award show without being hit with Colin Kaepernick lectures on the legacies of Lavery even while the whole world falls prostrate before the glories of juju celebrating ancient fertility rituals re-enacted on stages New Testament living tableaus yes Hollywood clearly has a problem but it isn't racism it's race-based stupidity I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show already so we will get to general fluent Elster in just one second and there's a lot to talk

late at night I'm all ready to go to bed and my kids to stop being a pain in the butt long enough for me to actually relax a little bit and then Donald Trump fires his national security advisor and all hell breaks I love my children but they didn't let me sleep a lot last night neither it turns out didn't Mike Flynn and Donald Trump so last night very late Donald Trump fires Mike Flynn so they're saying that Mike Flynn resigned and then Trump accepted the resignation it's the same difference it doesn't really make a difference bottom line is the national security adviser he submitted his resignation and Donald Trump accepted the resignation which raises a question what exactly did Michael Flynn do so you may have noticed that here on the bench Bureau show we have not been covering the unfolding Michael Flynn saga at all at all and it's a conscious choice and the reason it's a conscious choice is because there was no evidence that anything super wrong happened and there are a bunch of kind of rumors that maybe Flynn and talked to the Russians about sanctions before he was actually national security adviser well Obama was still president and then he had denied those rumors and then the FBI had investigated and they said they found nothing untoward and so we didn't cover any of that because it just seemed like a lot of back-and-forth and frankly even if it had come out that National Security Advisor General Michael Flynn had spoken with the Russian ambassador about sanctions I don't think it's that big a deal I don't I mean who's going to be the national security adviser in like three weeks trump was going to be president in three weeks Barack Obama was openly offering flexibility to the Russians in the middle of an election campaign as president of the United States in 2008 Barack Obama reached out to the Iranian government before he was president to tell them to just hold on he was coming to help so I didn't see that any of this as a big deal like I still don't understand what the huge deal here was here's sort of the timeline okay in February eight interviews according to Washington Post in a February 8th interview with The Washington Post Flynn categorically denied discussing sanctions with Russian ambassador surging a critically ACK repeating public assertions made in January by top trump officials so vice-president pence had said that that that's Lindh never talked to kiss lyac about about sanctions and so did Sean Spicer one day after the interview Flynn revised his account he told The Washington Post through a spokesman he couldn't be certain the topic never came up US intelligence reports during the 2016 campaign showed Chris lack was in touch with Flynn according to officials communications between the two continued after Trump's victory on November 8th according to officials with access to intelligence report on this matter so Trump officials including as I say Spicer and vice-president pence they'd said the same thing to the media that that Flynn had said which is that he never talked sanctioned now then it would this has been a big deal even if he did talk sanctions again I don't really see why it would I don't see why what nonetheless he has now resigned supposedly he resigned the reason that they're giving for him resigning is because they say that he lied depends that he told pence he didn't discuss sanctions he actually discussed sanctions and then pence went on national TV and then he was undercut by the fact that Flint had actually talked to engines and so he had to go maybe maybe I find it highly doubtful that that couldn't be fixed with an apology that Donald Trump couldn't just go on to Flint and say you need to apologize to pence I understand that you didn't think pence need to be on the loop on that but he needs to be in the loop on that you need to issue a public apology and we all move on with our lives and the idea that that was enough to fire him that doesn't seem particularly plausible clears Quinn's resignation letter so here's what he said he said in the course of my duties as the incoming national security adviser I held numerous phone calls with foreign counterparts ministers and ambassadors these calls were to facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessary relationship between the president his advisers and foreign leaders such calls are standard practice in any transition of this magnitude okay that seems like a pretty good excuse for everything that right there he says unfortunately because of the fast pace of events I inadvertently briefed the vice president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador I've sincerely apologized to the president and the VP and they've accepted my apology you would think that would be the end of it right but no he actually resigned and then he goes on to talk about how he's tendering his resignation and he's honored to serve President Trump and he wants to thank Trump for his personal loyalty and the friendship of people he worked with throughout the hard-fought campaign and he talks about president Trump's leadership etc etc etc so they're a bunch of theories floating around about what actually happened here because here's the deal okay there are a bunch of leaks that came out of the administration suggesting that Flynn had actually talked sanctions on the line but it was Trump that had to fire him Trump had to accept the resignation okay so this is on Trump the real question here is why Trump why he accepted the resignation we understand why the Intel community is targeting Trump a lot of the Intel community was appointed under Obama we understand they're members of the Intel community who are upset with the idea that Trump might be close to the Russians okay those are weeks they're not good and Trump has responded to that we'll get to the leaking in just a second but the real question here is why Trump accepted the resignation in the first place and there are a few theories floating around so I'm just going to offer you the theories and you decide for your based on evidence as it comes in Jerry what is he why depends he and presumably Trump didn't know about it either right and so Flynn basically went rogue and lied to everybody about having discussed sanctions on this call so I think that's a super plausible theory not only it's a super plausible theory that he was discussing sanctions on this phone call with the Russians and he lied to everybody and that pissed off Trump so much that Trump had to let him go that that does not seem super plausible to me specifically because Trump knew one month ago that this was the case and then he proceeded to appoint Flynn anyway so that seems implausible there's another theory and I think this is the most plausible theory which is that Trump said to Flynn you go ahead and you talk to the Russian ambassador say what you want to say he didn't explicitly tell him to talk about sanctions but Flynn talks about sanctions and then there was blowback and Trump didn't like the blowback and so he threw Flint under the bus so Flint offered his resignation and there was all these weeks coming out suggesting strong ties between Flynn and the Russians despite the fact that people have been accusing Flint of this for literally months and trump and going along with them and so Trump said okay you have to go and he used the depends thing as sort of a pretext then there's Theory three which is a pension right previously the RNC chair they have enough sway within the administration to force Trump to toss Flint out on his year for lying to them again I find that implausible Trump's the President of the United States if pence doesn't like it pence can stick it I mean Trump's alone with the power and then finally there's the fourth theory and this is the one the left is growing on to and that's the theory that the real reason that Trump decapitated Flynn is because he thought that this is going to lead back to him that he actually told Flynn go make nice with the Russians he was afraid that that was going to come out and then it did start to come out so he decapitated Flynn hoping out on the story right that's that sort of the the theory that the left is relying upon one thing is clear there is absolute chaos inside the administration so yesterday we played a clip of Stephen Miller the adviser to to senior advisor to to President Trump talking about how to say that we are in control events is significant understatement that's not what it looked like today and again if you're rooting for Trump to do well then you need him to do better than this if you're rooting for Trump to have a successful presidency you need him to do better than this and don't worry we'll talk about the democratic hypocrisy because there's tons of it we'll talk about the media wanting to get Trump because it really is vicious and nasty and drooling but first we got to talk about what's actually going on so yes there is chaos inside the administration that Cass was at was on full display yesterday Kelly on Conway goes on national TV this is like three 20 in the afternoon Pacific time she goes on national TV and she says the general Flint has Trump's full thrust yes general Flynn does enjoy the full confidence of the President and the big week for general Flynn he's the point of contact for many of these foreign visits if you look at the official schedule today we had the Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau here obviously for bilateral meetings on Wednesday we're welcoming Benjamin Netanyahu here to the White House and behind the scenes they're doing a number of different meetings where they're talking about trade the tournament terrorism security the fact that Canada the US are marrying a bottom line is she says it's when has Trump full trust and then literally within an hour's like it does about four o'clock Eastern Time so literally within an hour Sean Spicer comes out Nicias a statement saying we're going to be releasing a statement about this so clearly one hand is not talking to the other in any of this and remember Donald Trump said just like last Friday that he had no idea what's going on with Blaine he hadn't been reading any of the reports he said he didn't know what reports that people were even talking about this clip 19 I don't know about it I haven't seen what report is that 14:01 okay he hasn't seen it he'll look into it except that the report said that he was briefed on it over a month ago okay so there's a lot of confusion happening and then finally Flynn is gone and Paul Ryan comes out and says that Trump made the right decision on the Flynn resignation security is perhaps the most important function or responsibility of president has and I think the president made the right decision to ask for his resignation you cannot have a national security adviser misleading the vice president and others so I think the president was right to ask for his resignation okay so up in the air there's a communications gap because Trump says if Flynn offered his resignation and now Ryan is saying the Trump asks for his resignation right so there's all sorts of communications gaps here and a lot of confusion as to what exactly is going on one thing is clear we're not we don't know all the facts yet so all we can do is wait to hear all the facts again I'm puzzled the reason I'm you know talking about this and the reason I think it's interesting is because I'm puzzled as to why any of this aspire Bowl I just don't see like of all the things that people around Donald Trump have done throughout the campaign afterward that are they merit firing it seems to me that talking to the Russians about sanctions before you actually take office is like the last thing on the list that's really low on the list and fibbing to Mike Pence and Sean Spicer you think that Trump cares deeply about that maybe he does if so that'd be the first time that he's really been that tight with with either of those guys and Paul Ryan obviously as part of the sort of Reince Priebus wingman wants to see Flynn go so there's a lot of talk today about the conflict inside the administration between Steve Danon and his wing of the administration and the and the Rhines previous wing of the administration because ban and outlets like Breitbart today they're pushing Priebus like the headline at Breitbart today was that basically Priebus is responsible for flinty ouster even though Trump is the one who did the firing so a lot of confusion raining so the best available explanation the easiest available explanation and the minimum explanation is that there's a lot of amateurish nests and incompetence happening at the highest levels with regard to with regards to this particular issue and that's not a good thing now there's another issue that may be even deeper there's another issue here that may be even deeper and that is the leaks so again we don't because we don't know the of what exactly happened here why Trump fired Flynn again that's the big question why did he accept the resignation there is a secondary question and this is what Trump is focusing in on Trump tweeted out today that what the real issue here is leaks why is his administration so damn leaky he tweeted out the real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington will these leaks be happening as I deal on North Korea etc Trump is obviously very frustrated with the intelligence community he's been saying they've been leaking about him for literally months and he's not wrong they have been leaking about him for literally months there's a certain irony to Donald Trump being very angry at leaks considering that for literally a year and a half he was happy with leaks so long as they helped him now he's unhappy with leaks if they don't help him but it does demonstrate that the Intel community the the so-called deep state is very invested in hurting Donald Trump and taking out a lot of people around him is that for good reasons is that for bad reasons we don't know but it's not a good thing okay the Intel community is not supposed to be waging war against the administration that it's that's supposed to be serving and so Trump has a point here he does have a point now it still doesn't answer the question right the the Intel community could be leaking and Trump could have just said so what leak what you want I'm keeping Flynn deal but he didn't is that keeps that first question what is from doing on the table but yes the Intel community and their focus on Trump is going to be a long-standing problem for Trump I'm not sure how he cleans house I'm not sure what he does about it so two things can be true once the leaks can be really egregious and they can be really heavy and second there could be something nefarious going on inside the Trump administration and we have to have an explanation as to why Trump actually fired Flynn if nothing bad was happening here as again I'm looking at the scandal and I don't see the scandal like where's the scandal why is it a scandal the DS at the future NSA talks to the Russians I don't get it that Trump thought it was enough of a scandal to fire somebody so we're not getting the full story in all of that and that's and that's a problem it's still raising you know credibility issues Matt Lauer interview Kellyanne Conway about this and you can see the confusion you can see the fact that we now have a scandal on our hands because of what appears to be sort of a cover-up from the Trump administration here's Matt Lauer with Kellyanne Conway and Kellyanne looks really bad in this exchange well that's that's one characterization but the fact is that general flame continued in that position and was in the presidential daily briefings as part of the leader calls as recently as yesterday was there for the Prime Minister's visit from Canada yesterday and as time wore on obviously the situation to become unsustainable general Flint that makes no sense last month the Justice Department warned the White House that general Flynn had misled them and that as a result he was vulnerable to blackmail and at that moment he still had the complete trust of the president Matt I'm telling you what the president has said which is that he's accepted general foreigns resignation and he wishes and well and that we're moving on there are at least three candidates very strong candidates that will be considered for a permanent position here obviously general Keith Kellogg is the acting national security adviser starting today and the president is moving forward and she continues by saying we're not going to say what we knew and when we do it which is never a good sign okay you never want an administration saying that we're going to get to the hypocrisy of the Democrats in the media here in just a second because it is rich it is rich there's there's absolutely rich disgusting hypocrisy from the Democrats in the media the media are claiming this is the biggest cover-up the biggest story since iran-contra absolute garbage not true the Obama administration was replete with corrupt nasty officials who incorrupt nasty things were never fired by Obama at least Trump fired plain okay so we still have to know why I think that's the big question here because again I don't see what Flynn did that was so wrong here that an apology couldn't solve but the idea that this is unprecedented that this is something new that is the worst in Tehran Contra bunch of crap just absolute crap the National Security Adviser under Barack Obama Ben Rhodes was literally a fiction writer who literally wrote a fictional story about how Iran had reached out to the United States the moderates and Ron over an Iran nuclear deal the entire media swallowed the entire thing whole and then and then Rhodes came out and said he I fooled you all and no one cared okay Susan Rice the UN Ambassador went on national television and lied I was at 14 Times about how a YouTube video was responsible for what happened in Benghazi or she was wide too by the CIA it's the same sort of situation and no one seemed to care on the left so there's rich hypocrisy happening all over from the Democrats to media but
