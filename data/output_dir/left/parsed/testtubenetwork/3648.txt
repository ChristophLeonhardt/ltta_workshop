Tons of confiscated drugs are incinerated
in West Jakarta, Indonesia.
Indonesia has some of the strictest drug laws
in the world.
Currently, 11 drug smugglers, 7 of them foreigners,
are waiting to be executed via firing squad.
Australia is trying to stop the executions
of two citizens for heading a heroin drug
ring.
Australian PM Tony Abbott calls the executions,
“revolting,” and has threatened to stop
foreign aid to Indonesia.
However, Indonesia’s President defends the
decision.
In January, they executed 6 for drug trafficking.
