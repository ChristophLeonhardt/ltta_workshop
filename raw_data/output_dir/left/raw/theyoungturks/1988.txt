1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:02,350
SCOTT PRUITT'S WEEK OF
SCANDALS DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:07,330
GETTING BETTER, SO THE QUESTION
WE ARE LEFT WITH, WILL HE BE

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,570
THIS WEEK'S 6 PM WEST COAST
FIRING FROM THE TRUMP

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,130
ADMINISTRATION?

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,290
WE CAN'T GO BACK
THROUGH ALL THE SCANDALS BECAUSE

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,680
APPARENTLY EVERYONE AROUND HIM
WHO HAS DIRT ON HIM HAS DECIDED

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,710
TO FLOOD THE MARKETPLACE WITH
IT, BUT WE WILL TOUCH ON SOME OF

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:33,749
THE BIG ONES --

9
00:00:33,749 --> 00:00:42,359
SO 
THEY COULD PERHAPS LOOK

10
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,670
INTO THAT.

11
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,670
AND THERE ARE SO

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,839
MANY, THERE'S THE FACT THAT HE'S
GETTING THIS MASSIVELY

13
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:50,769
SUBSIDIZED HOUSING FROM SOMEONE
WHERE HE'S PUSHING FOR THEIR

14
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:55,989
CLIENTS, IT'S A HUGE QUID PRO
QUO, A SHADY REAL ESTATE DEAL,

15
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:00,739
HIS INSANE EXPENSES ON FIRST
CLASS AIR TRAVEL SEEMINGLY FOR

16
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:04,199
THINGS NOT RELATED TO HIS JOB,
HE HAS MORE SECURITY THAN

17
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:10,049
LEADERS OF MOST COUNTRIES,
SOUNDPROOF PHONE BOOTHS AND

18
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,560
OPPOSITION RESEARCHERS FOR THE
MEDIA, ALL OF THIS STUFF.

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
IT'S

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,359
CAUSING A LOT OF PROBLEMS FOR
HIM.

21
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,710
NOW, HE DOES HAVE SOMEONE

22
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,340
WHO APPARENTLY WANTS TO CLEAR
THE WHOLE THING UP AND GET RID

23
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:31,740
OF HIM --

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,130
THAT WAS EARLIER, AND SINCE
THEN DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY

25
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:52,950
TWEETED IN SUPPORT OF SCOTT
PRUITT, SAYING --

26
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,630
I HAVE A BELIEF, MAYBE IT'S
CRAZY, I THINK SOMEONE IN YOUR

27
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,749
ADMINISTRATION TALKED TO THE
WALL STREET JOURNAL, I THINK

28
00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:00,530
THAT IS PROBABLY AS CORRUPT AS
THE WHOLE THING IS.

29
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,530
I DON'T

30
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,530
THINK THEY MADE IT UP.

31
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,950
SO KELLY WANTS HIM OUT AND TRUMP
APPARENTLY DOESN'T WANT HIM

32
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,400
TO GO SO IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A
DISAGREEMENT AND PERHAPS

33
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,060
THERE IS A REASON FOR THAT,
THIS IS A REPORT AGAIN FROM

34
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:22,950
SOURCES INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE
--

35
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:30,580
THAT IS A TRIED AND TRUE
STRATEGIES OF FIVE-YEAR-OLDS

36
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,920
AROUND THE COUNTRY.

37
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,430
BUT WHAT I
LOVE ABOUT THAT IS THAT HE HAS

38
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,710
SAID THAT THE CHIEF OF STAFF, AN
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT POSITION

39
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,780
INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE, TRUMP
DOESN'T WANT IT, HE WANTS TO

40
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,640
ELIMINATE THAT AND DO THAT JOB
HIMSELF, WHICH IS LITERALLY A

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,890
SUBPLOT OF THE OFFICE.

42
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,560
THAT'S
WHAT DWIGHT DOES, HE BECOMES HIS

43
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,910
OWN NUMBER TWO.

44
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,920
DONALD TRUMP IS
WATCHING TOO MUCH NETFLIX.

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,330
EVERYONE SAYS WE WANT
BUSINESS PEOPLE TO RUN THE

46
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,030
GOVERNMENT, BUT IN DONALD
TRUMP'S WORLD RUNNING A BUSINESS

47
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,030
JUST MEANS DOING WHATEVER YOU
WANT AND HAVING NO ONE WHO IS

48
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,660
GOING TO CHECK YOU IN ANY WAY,
NOT HAVING ANY KIND OF

49
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:14,800
LEGISLATORS, ANY TYPES OF RULES
THAT ARE GOING TO STOP YOU, BUT

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,910
TO ME WHAT'S MORE FRUSTRATING
ABOUT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY SCOTT

51
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,770
PRUITT IS CORRUPT -- I KEEP
WANTING TO CURSE AND THEN I

52
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,920
REALIZE I CAN'T -- BUT IT'S ALL
MOST LAUGHABLE HOW BAD HE IS,

53
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:32,200
BUT IN THE MEANTIME HIS EPA HAS
BEEN TRAINED TO PUSH THROUGH 22

54
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,430
WAYS OF DEREGULATING
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS.

55
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,430
SO

56
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,940
THERE IS ACTUAL DAMAGE BEING
DONE BY THE PERSON IN THIS

57
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,300
POSITION, AND WHAT WE ARE SO
FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY ABOUT AND

58
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,780
THE REASON HE MIGHT GET KICKED
OUT IS BECAUSE HE IS CORRUPT AND

59
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,430
HE'S GETTING KICKBACKS ON HIS
RENT.

60
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,450
AND IN THE MEANTIME THOSE

61
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:56,620
ARE GOING TO BE LIFE-THREATENING
EFFECTS FROM THAT DEREGULATION.

62
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:03,090
BUT ISN'T THIS JUST, YOU
KNOW, SAME AS USUAL?

63
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,090
GOING

64
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,840
THROUGH THIS POLITICAL PROCESS
EVEN FROM THE BEGINNING, WE SEE

65
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,970
THE CORRUPTION OF MONEY EVEN
JUST AS A CANDIDATE.

66
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,970
IT STARTS

67
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,970
THERE.

68
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,810
OUR ENTIRE GOVERNMENT
RIGHT NOW, MOST OF THEM, AND I

69
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,450
WILL SAY THIS VERY BOLDLY, I
BELIEVE THEY ARE BOUGHT AND PAID

70
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,450
FOR.

71
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,350
I MEAN, THIS IS WHAT WE ARE
SEEING DOWN THE LINE, I'M SEEING

72
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,540
IT EVEN WITH THE PEOPLE I'M
RUNNING AGAINST.

73
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,540
THEY HAVE TAKEN

74
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,310
MONEY FROM CORPORATIONS AND THEY
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DEFENDERS OF

75
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,160
CERTAIN INDUSTRIES AND CERTAIN
INITIATIVES BUT YET THEY ARE

76
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,290
TAKING MONEY FROM EXACTLY THE
OPPOSITE, AND WE SEE THAT WITH

77
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,840
PRUITT, EVEN IN SOME OF THE
THINGS HE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF. AND

78
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,000
I SAY THIS REALLY IS STARTING
JUST EVEN FROM THE BASIS OF OUR

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,060
GOVERNMENT, AND THAT'S THE BASIC
ELECTED OFFICIAL ON UP, AND WE

80
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,060
ARE SEEING THAT.

81
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,820
AND UNTIL WE
START CHANGING THAT I THINK WE

82
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,770
ARE CRAVING AN ENVIRONMENT FOR
MORE JOHN KELLYS.

83
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,350
IT REMINDED ME OF ONE LAST
LITTLE ANECDOTE WHEN I WAS

84
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,760
REMINDED OF HOW HE WANTED THE
SIRENS PUT ON HIS CAR SO HE

85
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,710
COULD SPEED THROUGH TRAFFIC
FASTER, THAT REMINDS ME OF

86
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,690
RUSSIA IN KIND OF THE 90S AND
EARLY 2000 BECAUSE OF HER MEMBER

87
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,920
ALL THE TIME GOING AS A KID TO
VISIT FAMILY, YOU SEE ALL THESE

88
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,870
BLACK CARS GOING BY WITH THE
BLUE SIRENS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

89
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,700
YOU CAN DO IN A CORRUPT COUNTRY
LIKE THAT, YOU THROW THE THING

90
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,910
ON AND PASS EVERYONE BY.

91
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,270
WHICH LEADS ME TO MY POINT, I
WAS SURPRISED WHEN SCOTT PRUITT

92
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,870
WAS IN TROUBLE FOR SO-CALLED
CORRUPTION WHEN THAT IS CHILD'S

93
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,020
PLAY COMPARED TO WHAT TRUMP
DOES.

94
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,190
NOT ONLY DOES HE OF COURSE

95
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:39,310
SUPPORT PRUITT'S ACTIONS IN NOT
BATTLING CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE

96
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,650
FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY, ETC., BUT
THE $50 A NIGHT CORRUPTION WHERE

97
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,850
HE'S STAYING IS NOTHING COMPARED
TO TRUMP UNIVERSITY.

98
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,850
AND AS WE

99
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,730
REPORTED EARLIER IN THE WEEK
IT'S OBVIOUS SOMEONE IN THE

100
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,540
ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO PUT A
HATCHET IN PRUITT'S BACK, BUT

101
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,550
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WAS TRUMP
SO WHEN THE SPOKESPERSON CAME

102
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,360
OUT YESTERDAY AND SAID WE ARE
EVALUATING HIM AND WE DON'T KNOW

103
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,910
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, THAT'S
WHEN I THOUGHT HE WAS DONE

104
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:10,340
BECAUSE I THOUGHT TRUMP SENT HIM
OUT TO GIVE HIM THE OLD SENDOFF,

105
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,380
WE ARE EVALUATING, NOT SURE
ABOUT IT, BUT IT TURNS OUT, NO,

106
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,051
GUYS LIKE JOHN KELLY CLEARLY
WANTED TO GET RID OF HIM, THEY

107
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:21,750
WERE SOURCES FOR FOX NEWS, THE
WALL STREET JOURNAL, THE ONES

108
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,460
CLEARLY THROWING ALL THIS DIRT
ON HIM, BUT TRUMP APPARENTLY NOT

109
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,460
INVOLVED.

110
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,910
IN BY THE WAY IT'S
TRUMP, HE COULD CHANGE HIS MIND

111
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,420
EIGHT TIMES LATER TODAY.

112
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,280
HE
MIGHT BE LIKE HE'S GOOD, HE'S

113
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,520
TERRIBLE, THEN ONE DAY HE WILL
JUST BLURT OUT HE'S FIRED, AND

114
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,670
HE WILL BE GONE.

115
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,180
OR HE WON'T. MY
GUESS IS THAT KNOWING TRUMP'S

116
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,580
CHARACTER AND PRUITT'S
CHARACTER, THEY PROBABLY GET

117
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,290
ALONG WELL AND THAT'S WHY PRUITT
WAS TRYING TO MOVE UP THE RANKS

118
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,490
AND GET AN EVEN HIGHER POST IN
THE ADMINISTRATION.

119
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,490
THAT'S WHAT

120
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,860
MADE OTHER PEOPLE ANGRY AND
THAT'S WHY THEY LEAKED ALL THESE

121
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,360
THINGS AGAINST HIM, BUT TRUMP
MIGHT LIKE THAT.

122
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
HE LIKES PEOPLE

123
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,730
BATTLING AND PUNCHING EACH OTHER
IN THE FACE AND DOING UNTOLD

124
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,480
DAMAGE TO ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE
HE'S AMUSED BY IT, HE'S KING

125
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
JOFFREY.

126
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,360
THE CULTURE IS SET AT THE
TOP, AND ANY ORGANIZATION.

127
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
IF

128
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,340
YOU SET THAT TONE THAT'S HOW THE
PEOPLE WORKING FOR YOU, WORKING

129
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,740
WITH YOU, THAT'S HOW THEY ARE
GOING TO ACT.

130
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,620
WHEN HE SAYS SOMETHING, THERE
IS SO MANY LAYERS TO IT.

131
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,620
LIKE,

132
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,050
HE SAYS HE HAS MY SUPPORT --
OKAY, THOSE ARE THE LAST WORDS A

133
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,860
LOT OF PEOPLE IN YOUR
ADMINISTRATION HEARD THE FOUR

134
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,010
THEY WERE BOOTED, USUALLY WHILE
ON THE TOILET.

135
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,230
BUT I DO KNOW

136
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,850
THIS, WHEN HE LASHES OUT AT THE
MEDIA AND SAYS A STORY IS

137
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:44,320
UNTRUE, YOU CAN BET EVERY CENT
IT'S TRUE.

138
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,410
MAYBE HE GETS THROWN

139
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,610
OUT OF THE EPA, MAYBE HE
DOESN'T, BUT I CAN SAY THIS, HE

140
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,080
DEFINITELY WANTS HIM TO BECOME
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, THAT IS

141
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,160
OBVIOUSLY HIS GOAL HERE.

142
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,729
HE'S
HATED SESSIONS IN THAT POSITION

143
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:57,900
FOR A LONG TIME, EVERY MONTH OR
SO HE REMEMBERS TO TAKE HIM OUT

144
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,490
INTO THE PUBLIC SQUARE AND FLOG
HIM, HE DOESN'T WANT HIM IN

145
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,330
THAT POSITION AND THIS TWEET IS
PROOF OF THAT.

146
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,250
WITH THE TOP ADMINISTRATION
IT'S THE DEVIL YOU KNOW.

147
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,250
THAT'S

148
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,430
THE SCARY PART, SCOTT PRUITT
LEAVES HERE, WHO MIGHT POP UP

149
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,430
NEXT?

150
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,760
HE ALREADY GOT JOHN BOLTON
AS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR

151
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,870
WHICH TO ME IS THE MOST
TERRIFYING DEVELOPMENT WE'VE

152
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,340
SEEN, SO WHO COULD POSSIBLY COME
AFTER SCOTT PRUITT?

153
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,270
FINALLY I WANT TO TURN TO
JOHN KELLY BECAUSE I THINK IN

154
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,940
TODAY'S NEWS THAT'S THE MOST
INTERESTING PART, APPARENTLY HE

155
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,130
ALONG WITH SESSIONS ARE THE
PEOPLE WHO WANT PRUITT OUT

156
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,659
BECAUSE PRUITT IS TRYING TO MOVE
UP AND CREATE ALL THIS DRAMA AND

157
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,259
CAUSING TROUBLE FOR THE
ADMINISTRATION, A SMART MOVE BY

158
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:40,948
KELLY TO TRY TO GET RID OF THIS
GUY BEFORE HE BLEW UP ON THEM,

159
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:42,799
WHICH HE DID THIS WEEK.

160
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,079
BUT THE
MACHINATIONS AGAINST KELLY ARE

161
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:47,869
MORE INTERESTING BECAUSE HE'S
CHIEF OF STAFF, IT'S THE MOST

162
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:51,339
IMPORTANT POSITION ARGUABLY,
THAT'S WHO DETERMINES WHO GETS

163
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:54,020
TO SEE THE PRESIDENT AND WHO
DOESN'T, THERE ARE A LOT OF

164
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,089
KNIVES OUT FOR HIM BECAUSE HE'S
BEEN BLOCKING QUESTIONER AND

165
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:02,550
IVANKA TO SOME DEGREE, AND COREY
LEWANDOWSKI, SO THEY ARE ALL

166
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,550
AGAINST HIM.

167
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,930
SO THE PRESIDENT
DOING THIS CHILDISH THING OF I'M

168
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:11,170
NOT GOING TO PUT YOU IN THE
MEETINGS, THERE IS A TARIFF, I

169
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:17,740
DIDN'T TELL YOU -- JOFFREY-LIKE,
IT DOESN'T BODE WELL FOR KELLY.

170
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:23,040
KELLY'S ALLIES ARE TELLING CBS
NEWS THAT HIS RETREAT IS

171
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,720
STRATEGIC.

172
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,259
NO IT'S NOT, HE'S GETTING
SIDELINED AND HE'S

173
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:28,880
HUMILIATED AND EMBARRASSED.

174
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,689
AS HE SHOULD BE, AS SHOULD
ANYONE WHO IS WILLING TO

175
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:33,389
WORK FOR THIS PRESIDENT.

176
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:36,690
AND JOHN KELLY APPARENTLY
ACCORDING TO ALLIES IS HOPING TO

177
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,720
JUST MAKE IT ONE YEAR AND THAT
WOULD BE IN JULY, I'M NOT SURE

178
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,339
HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT.

179
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:45,529
AND I THINK THAT KELLY
IS IN BIGGER TROUBLE THAN PRUITT

180
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:48,670
BECAUSE TRUMP DOES NOT LIKE NO.

181
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,199
HE DOES NOT LIKE BEING TOLD THAT

182
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:52,199
HE IS AN IDIOT.

183
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:53,280
KELLY DOES NOT
SAY THAT WAY BECAUSE HE IS A

184
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,259
SMART GUY, HE GOES MR.PRESIDENT,
THAT IS A SMART IDEA,

185
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:58,259
BUT...

186
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:01,321
AND HE PHRASES IT IN A
MATURE WAY, BUT TRUMP DOES NOT

187
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:02,321
LIKE THAT.

188
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:04,040
HE JUST WANT TO GET RID OF

189
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,290
HIM SO HE CAN GO BACK TO MAKE
THE MESS THAT HE ENJOYS.

190
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,290
HE IS

191
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,439
LIKE, WHERE IS MY PLAY-DOH?

192
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:11,050
SO KELLY'S DAYS ARE

193
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,260
PROBABLY NUMBERED.

194
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,529
IT IS AMAZING HOW EACH PERSON
THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO SOME OF

195
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:22,610
THESE VERY IMPORTANT POSITIONS,
WHETHER IT'S EDUCATION, HOUSING,

196
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:27,819
ON TOP OF THE ENVIRONMENT, EACH
ONE HAS ALWAYS BEEN PUT IN THERE

197
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:30,230
TO TOTALLY DISMANTLE IT FROM THE
BEGINNING.

198
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,230
THAT HAS BEEN THE

199
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,230
AGENDA.

200
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,040
I DO NOT THINK ANY OF
THIS SHOULD BE A SURPRISE TO ANY

201
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,220
OF US BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN HIS
AGENDA FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,

202
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,329
IT'S A TOTAL PRO CORPORATE
STANCE AND THAT IS WHY WE EVEN

203
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:44,329
SEE A

204
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:46,990
LARGE NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS ON
BILLS THAT I AM ASTONISHED THAT

205
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,660
WE HAVE ANY DEMOCRATS VOTING YES
ON, THAT ARE VOTING YES ON THESE

206
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,059
THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING
SURE THAT THOSE BILLS GET PASSED

207
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:57,790
BECAUSE IT SUITS THE AGENDA OF
WHAT WE HAVE NOW IN OUR

208
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,410
HOUSE, AND ARE SENATE.

209
00:10:59,410 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE IN AMERICA.
