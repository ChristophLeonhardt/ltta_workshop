1
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,362
>> Laura: HIGH-STAKES TRAUMA

2
00:00:15,362 --> 00:00:20,167
CAN HAVE LAUGHS.

3
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:25,572
THE PRESIDENT'S CANDID QUIPS.

4
00:00:25,572 --> 00:00:30,077
HERE IS RAYMOND ARROYO.

5
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:31,345
COMMENTS ABOUT PHYSICAL

6
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:31,745
APPEARANCE.

7
00:00:31,745 --> 00:00:32,880
SPEAK WITH THE PRESIDENT GETS UP

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,848
AND THEY ARE TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS

9
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:36,183
AND HE

10
00:00:36,183 --> 00:00:36,817
SAYS THIS TO KIM JONG UN.

11
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:40,654
WATCH CLOSELY.

12
00:00:40,654 --> 00:00:41,689
>> VERY NICE.

13
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:46,126
GETTING A GOOD PICTURE EVERYBODY

14
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:54,601
SO WE LOOK HANDSOME AND THIN?

15
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:55,269
LAUGHTER >> Laura: HE LOOKS

16
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:58,439
THRILLED.

17
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,173
>> KIM JONG UN IS THINKING DID

18
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:07,614
HE SAY THIS TO THERESA MAY?

19
00:01:07,614 --> 00:01:10,985
IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF TRUMP,

20
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:13,454
THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE BACK AND

21
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:14,488
FORTH, DOMINATING KIM JONG UN.

22
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:15,990
THE HANDSHAKE, THE WAY HE

23
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,725
EMBRACED HIM, SHOWED HIM THE

24
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:18,058
WAY.

25
00:01:18,058 --> 00:01:18,892
THERE YOU SEE IT AGAIN.

26
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:22,696
>> Laura: HILARIOUS.

27
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:23,664
THERE WAS A LOT OF CONVERSATION

28
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:25,232
ABOUT THE LUNCHEON.

29
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:26,533
>> I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE CNN,

30
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:31,638
EVEN WITH BOURDAIN'S PASSING,

31
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:32,206
THEY HAVE A CULINARY

32
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:34,041
SENSIBILITY.

33
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,042
JUST LOOK.

34
00:01:35,042 --> 00:01:36,877
>> BY RELEASING THE DETAILS OF

35
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:39,680
THE MENU, THIS IS LEGITIMIZING

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,080
KIM JONG UN.

37
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,882
>> THE POOR NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE.

38
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:46,053
IF THEY KNEW WHAT'S BEING DISHED

39
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:46,320
OUT.

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,155
THEY CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THE

41
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:50,691
TYPES OF FOODS.

42
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:54,061
>> IT'S A POOR COUNTRY.

43
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:54,762
BECAUSE OF KIM JONG UN HIMSELF

44
00:01:54,762 --> 00:01:58,465
AND HIS FAMILY.

45
00:01:58,465 --> 00:02:01,068
BEEF SHORT RIBS, SWEET AND SOUR

46
00:02:01,068 --> 00:02:02,870
CRISPY PORK, FRIED RICE,

47
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,473
SOY-BRAISED CODFISH.

48
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:07,207
THAT SOUNDS REALLY YUMMY AND

49
00:02:07,207 --> 00:02:11,578
VERY EXPENSIVE.

50
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:11,945
[LAUGHTER]

51
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:13,580
>> Laura: WHAT ARE THEY

52
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,081
SUPPOSED TO SERVE?

53
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:16,950
>> RAMEN NOODLES OR FROZEN TV

54
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,284
DINNERS?

55
00:02:17,284 --> 00:02:19,753
>> Laura: I TOLD THEM TO BRING

56
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:20,454
IN-N-OUT BURGERS.

57
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:21,989
I'M SORRY BUT THAT WOULD BE

58
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:22,656
REALLY TASTY.

59
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:26,360
>> HOW DID IT TURN INTO A "PARTS

60
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,463
UNKNOWN" SEGMENT?

61
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:31,331
>> Laura: I LIKE HOW DON     DON

62
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:33,967
LEMMON TAKES HIS GLASSES OFF.

63
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:36,737
QUAIL EGGS ON THE MENU.

64
00:02:36,737 --> 00:02:43,177
WE LOVE THE BODY LANGUAGE.

65
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:44,511
>> CNN HAS THEIR OWN BODY

66
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:46,080
LANGUAGE EXPERT >> THE PERSON

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,681
WAS LEFT THE PICTURE,

68
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:49,983
KIM JONG UN IN THAT MOMENT, HAS

69
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:50,584
THE POSITION OF POWER.

70
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:52,820
THE PERSON ON THE LEFT, LEFT A

71
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,654
PICTURE WILL ALWAYS BE SEEN AS

72
00:02:53,654 --> 00:02:55,656
THE PERSON IN THE POWER

73
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:56,056
POSITION.

74
00:02:56,056 --> 00:02:59,059
FOR TRUMP, AS THEIR SHAKING

75
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:01,395
HANDS, TAKES 13 SECONDS.

76
00:03:01,395 --> 00:03:04,698
HE WILL DO AN UPPER ARM GRAB ON

77
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:06,333
KIM JONG UN.

78
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,802
>> I WANT TO POINT OUT I AM ON

79
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:10,537
THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND

80
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:11,472
I AM MORE DOMINANT AND I'M GOING

81
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:14,641
TO GIVE YOU THE ARM.

82
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:16,176
WHAT DOES BEING ON THE LEFT OR

83
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:19,446
RIGHT HAVE TO DO WITH DOMINANCE?

84
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:20,080
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

85
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,549
I GET THAT GRABBING A NEW

86
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,718
CONTROL BY GRABBING SOMEBODY'S

87
00:03:24,718 --> 00:00:00,000
ARM.
