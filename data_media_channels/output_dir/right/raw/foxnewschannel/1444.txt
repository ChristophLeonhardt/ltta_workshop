1
00:00:00,573 --> 00:00:01,975
ADMINISTRATION DID NOTHING.

2
00:00:01,975 --> 00:00:03,109
I SHUT DOWN ZTE.

3
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:10,183
NOW HE'S GOING TO REOPEN IT.

4
00:00:10,183 --> 00:00:10,333
NEIL

5
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:10,783
NEI

6
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:11,084
NEIL?

7
00:00:11,084 --> 00:00:11,818
>> Neil: JOHN ROBERTS AT THE

8
00:00:11,818 --> 00:00:12,251
WHITE HOUSE.

9
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:14,087
THANKS VERY MUCH.

10
00:00:14,087 --> 00:00:18,925
AND NOW TO THE SUMMIT.

11
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:23,363
CLAUDIA ROSETTE IS WITH US.

12
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:24,230
YOU'RE CONCERN IS THAT THE NORTH

13
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,232
KOREANS HAVE A LOT OF ABOUT

14
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:28,735
FACING ON COMMITMENTS AND THING

15
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:29,936
WOULDN'T BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME.

16
00:00:29,936 --> 00:00:30,670
>> EXACTLY.

17
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,338
THE THING THAT IS DIFFERENT THIS

18
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:35,274
TIME, PRESIDENT TRUMP INSTEAD OF

19
00:00:35,274 --> 00:00:37,110
THE USUAL U.S. DIPLOMATIC

20
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,012
PRACTICE OF CHASING AFTER THEM,

21
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:43,282
TRYING TO ENTICE THEM SAID OKAY,

22
00:00:43,282 --> 00:00:43,583
FINE.

23
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,618
I'M CANCELLING THE SUMMIT.

24
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:46,819
I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.

25
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:48,287
>> Neil: SO IF THE SUMMIT IS

26
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:50,356
BACK ON, WHAT WOULD CHANGE HERE?

27
00:00:50,356 --> 00:00:51,557
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S BACK ON FOR

28
00:00:51,557 --> 00:00:54,927
JUNE 12, WHICH EVERY DAY THAT

29
00:00:54,927 --> 00:00:56,729
GOES BUY MAKES THAT MORE

30
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:58,631
PROBLEMATIC WHAT DO YOU THROUGH?

31
00:00:58,631 --> 00:01:00,600
>> YEAH, I'VE BEEN SKEPTICAL

32
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,535
FROM THE BEGINNING THAT IT CAN

33
00:01:02,535 --> 00:01:05,972
ACHIEVE THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF

34
00:01:05,972 --> 00:01:09,776
NORTH KOREA BUT I THINK ACTUALLY

35
00:01:09,776 --> 00:01:11,477
THE WAY IT'S PLAYING OUT SO FAR

36
00:01:11,477 --> 00:01:14,013
HAS BEEN GOOD.

37
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:15,114
I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP CAUGHT

38
00:01:15,114 --> 00:01:21,187
THEM AS FAR AS THE KABOOKIE

39
00:01:21,187 --> 00:01:21,921
THEATER.

40
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:24,190
I THINK HE CAUGHT THEM

41
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:24,590
FLAT-FOOTED.

42
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,627
THE COINCIDENCE THAT THEY WERE

43
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:30,029
PUTTING ON THIS SHOW OF BLOWING

44
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:31,964
UP THEIR APPARENTLY ALREADY

45
00:01:31,964 --> 00:01:34,133
DEFUNCT NUCLEAR TESTING SITE AS

46
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:35,935
HE WAS RELEASING THE LETTER

47
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:37,336
CANCELLING THE SUMMIT, I

48
00:01:37,336 --> 00:01:38,905
THOUGHT -- NORTH KOREA IS NO

49
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:41,174
JOKE BUT THIS WAS ALMOST FUNNY.

50
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:43,276
YOU NOTICE THEY HAVEN'T MADE A

51
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:44,711
HUGE PROTEST OVER THAT.

52
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:47,880
THEY KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT IT

53
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,348
WAS AN EMPTY GESTURE.

54
00:01:49,348 --> 00:01:52,051
THEY WERE SORT OF OFFERING IT AS

55
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:55,488
ONE MORE GIVE-AWAY TO US.

56
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:57,890
IT WAS WORTH NOTHING.

57
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,259
A GREAT DANGER IN NORTH KOREA.

58
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:01,694
THE MORE THAT TRUMP GIVES THEM

59
00:02:01,694 --> 00:02:04,297
SOME OF THEIR OWN MEDICINE, THE

60
00:02:04,297 --> 00:02:05,331
BETTER I THINK THAT IS.

61
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:07,700
STILL LEAVES US WITH A PROBLEM

62
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,936
OF HOW DO WE STOP THE NORTH

63
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:11,537
KOREAN NUCLEAR THREAT.

64
00:02:11,537 --> 00:02:12,572
>> Neil: HOW DO WE?

65
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:14,407
PEOPLE SAY ALL ROADS GO THROUGH

66
00:02:14,407 --> 00:02:14,707
CHINA.

67
00:02:14,707 --> 00:02:16,209
I DON'T THINK IT WAS ACCIDENTAL

68
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,744
THAT THE PRESIDENT REFERRED TO

69
00:02:17,744 --> 00:02:21,380
THE CHANGE IN POSTURE OF THE

70
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,050
NORTH KOREANS POST KIM JONG-UN

71
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,486
MEETING WITH THE CHINESE

72
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:28,988
PRESIDENT THAT SOMETHING CHANGED

73
00:02:28,988 --> 00:02:31,190
SINCE THEN.

74
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,760
MAYBE IT WAS A MORE BELLICOSE

75
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,962
POSITION RECOMMENDED BY THE

76
00:02:35,962 --> 00:02:36,295
CHINESE.

77
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:37,563
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH IS

78
00:02:37,563 --> 00:02:37,864
THERE.

79
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:41,534
BUT NOW WE HAVE THIS DEAL TO GET

80
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:43,102
ZTE, THE CHINESE TELECOM CONCERN

81
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:44,070
BACK ON THE TROUBLE.

82
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,571
THAT MAYBE MEANS A TRADE

83
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:48,674
CONCESSION IS COMING, WHAT DO

84
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:51,611
YOU THINK?

85
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:55,214
>> YEAH, I DON'T THINK WE'VE

86
00:02:55,214 --> 00:02:58,050
SEEN MORE TO THIS IN THE PUBLIC

87
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,485
REALM.

88
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:02,355
ZTE IS IMMESHED WITH THE BACK

89
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:03,890
ROOM NEGOTIATIONS OF NORTH

90
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,190
KOREA.

91
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,462
I STILL WORRY ABOUT CHINESE

92
00:03:09,462 --> 00:03:10,096
BUYING.

93
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:13,966
I'M VERY WORRIED ABOUT

94
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:14,367
ELECTRONICS.

95
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:15,735
CHINA HAS PLANS THAT ARE NOT

96
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:18,371
FRIENDLY TO US TO NEXT 30 YEARS.

97
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:22,375
BY 2049, THEY WANT TO BE THE

98
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,776
DOMINANT WORLD POWER.

99
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,679
AS FAR AS NORTH KOREA, CHINA HAS

100
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:29,215
NEVER BEEN OUR FRIEND.

101
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:33,753
IN A WAY, CHINA IS NORTH KOREA'S

102
00:03:33,753 --> 00:03:35,788
NUCLEAR UMBRELLA.

103
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:38,724
WOULD THEY GO TO WORE WITH US

104
00:03:38,724 --> 00:03:40,193
OVER NORTH KOREA?

105
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:41,127
PROBABLY NOT.

106
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:42,895
NORTH KOREA HAS HAD CHINA'S OKAY

107
00:03:42,895 --> 00:03:45,164
TO PURSUE NUCLEAR WEAPONS FOR

108
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:45,464
YEARS.

109
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:48,234
CHINA COULD HAVE STOPPED THAT.

110
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:50,036
THEY DID NOT.

111
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:52,772
SO WHEN YOU READ THAT CHINA IS

112
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:54,540
DISMAYED ABOUT THEIR NUCLEAR

113
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,275
WEAPONS, NO.

114
00:03:56,275 --> 00:04:00,446
THE REAL NUCLEAR POWER IS CHINA,

115
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:02,548
AND RUSSIAN, BY THE WAY, THAT IS

116
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:03,549
BUDDIES WITH NORTH KOREA.

117
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:06,519
THERE'S BIGGER THREATS FURTHER

118
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,487
OUT BUT MUCH BIGGER.

119
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:11,958
CHINA I THINK USES NORTH KOREA

120
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:15,161
AS A TEST CASE, THAT'S HOW YOU

121
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:16,562
CAN PUSH THE ENVELOPE.

122
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:17,829
NORTH KOREA HAS GONE TOO FAR FOR

123
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,867
MANY YEARS TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE

124
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:23,836
WORLD THAT IF YOU PLAY CHICKEN

125
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:25,671
WITH THE UNITED STATES, WE WILL

126
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:26,172
BACK DOWN.

127
00:04:26,172 --> 00:04:28,541
THAT'S THE DIFFICULT GAME THAT

128
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,910
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TO PLAY.

129
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,745
WE CAN'T LET NORTH KOREA KEEP

130
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:33,880
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

131
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,148
I DOUBT HE CAN SOLVE THIS

132
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:36,749
DIPLOMATICALLY.

133
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:40,553
IT MAY COME TO MILITARY ACTION.

134
00:04:40,553 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Neil: WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
