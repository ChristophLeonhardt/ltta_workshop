00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:55,223
THAT ROSE UP AND PAID THE

88
00:02:55,223 --> 00:02:57,825
ULTIMATE SACRIFICE.

89
00:02:57,825 --> 00:02:58,760
AS A NATION, WE MUST ALWAYS A

90
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,194
MEMBER TO TAKE THE TIME OUT TO

91
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:04,065
NOT ONLY HONOR AND MEMORIALIZE

92
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:06,834
THOSE HEROES, BUT ALSO THE

93
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:07,502
FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES LEFT

94
00:03:07,502 --> 00:03:10,872
BEHIND AS A RESULT OF THAT.
