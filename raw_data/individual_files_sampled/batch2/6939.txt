now the total cost of the GOP tax plan is not one point six trillion that's how much it adds to the deficit it's actually five point eight trillion dollars and CNBC among many other outlets have explained all different parts that cost five point eight trillion dollars now that what it adds to the deficit according to the Joint Committee on taxation is the one point six trillion dollars I tell you that because it's important to have the context that there's another four point two trillion that almost no one ever talks about and that is in tax increases for the middle class so if you deduct a state and local taxes you're not allowed to deduct those anymore that's a tax increase for you and there's a whole bunch of exemptions that they took away from actual taxpayers now for corporations they have different rules and they did not get rid of almost any of their loopholes in fact there was a famous moment that we showed you on the program where they had a Republican congressman on MSNBC and they asked them to name just one corporate loophole that they took away and he couldn't name a single one so they're taking away your deductions in order to pay for the bill they also took away the in this bill so far the mandate in Affordable Care Act which will actually drive prices up so you'll have to pay a higher premium on your health care coverage so that four point two trillion dollars so causes a tremendous amount of damage and pain to the average American taxpayer and then on top of that they still couldn't fill the hole and they got a one point six trillion dollars that they are adding to the debt now that is terrible these are the guys who claim that they don't that they don't ever want unbalanced budgets and they don't want dead or deficits they were obviously not being truthful about that now I'm gonna get to how they're gonna make up that 1.6 trillion in a second and it is devastating but first I want you to know where the money is going so all that money where is it well 80% of the tax benefits would accrue to those in the top one percent households making more than a about nine hundred thousand dollars a year would see their taxes drop by more than two hundred thousand dollars on average so 80% of the money is going to the richest people in the country and in fact if you're basically a millionaire you're gonna get a two hundred thousand dollar tax cut your are if you're in the bottom 99 percent you think you're gonna get two hundred thousand dollars mm-hmm but for the millionaires they're averaging two hundred thousand dollars in their pockets because of this that's who this tax cuts for so how are they gonna pay for it well now that comes into play Paul Ryan who came out with tax plan in the first place says oh yeah we're gonna get it by cutting your entitlements they call it entitle most you know why they call Social Security and Medicare in tenements because you paid into it hence you are entitled to get it back it's your money he says nope we're gonna cut it we're gonna cut your money and give it to the rich that's literal hey you saw where the money's going so let me give you Ryan's quotes says we're gonna have to get back next year at entitlement reform which is how you tackle the debt and the deficit but that extra one point six trillion dollars in the debt wouldn't exist if you didn't give her a giant tax cut to a millionaires and billionaires yeah I know but yeah but I had to I had to they're my donors I had to give them all your money and so how am I going to tackle the deficit that I just created by taking away your Social Security and Medicare these people are the worst people on earth okay more from the hill health care entitlements such as Medicare and Medicaid are the big drivers of the debt Ryan said so we spend more time on the health care entitlements because that's really where the problem lies fiscally speaking the problem doesn't line the five point eight trillion dollars they just gave to the wrench.now problem lies that you're getting too much health care right if you're in the middle of Nebraska West Virginia Kentucky Montana California or wherever you are you have too much stuff right you have too much health care you're a lipid and they're living in the lap of luxury you're like I don't know what to do with all this health care I don't know what to do with all this Medicare oh please take mine away right they're gonna take away your Medicare which pulls that seventy seven percent you know why cuz it works they're gonna take that away to give to the rich it's unreal it's a reverse Robin Hood it is redistribution of wealth the thing that they warned you about is because it was action they were always doing redistribution of wealth and this is one of the greatest American robberies of all time I have more quotes so and the hill points that wait a minute during this his campaign Trump repeatedly promised not to cut Medicare Medicaid or Social Security so what's going on here well Paul Ryan's asked about that on a radio show listen to his answer here and are you thinking about trying to do any reforms with Social Security or Medicare at this point or do we you know President Trump hasn't seemed interested in those things yeah he has not shown as much interest and so we're working with the President on the entitlement that he wants to reform that he's supportive of do you do you get the sense that you're making a little bit of an impact on him when you talk to him about the importance of Medicare reform I do as you know Ross because you and I have known each other for years this has been my big thing yeah many many years I think it's the biggest in title but that's got to have reform and I think the president's understanding choice and competition works everywhere in health care especially in Medicare so if you were unclear that they were coming for Medicare they are progressives want Medicare for all because it works it keeps prices low and it gives you the health care that you need it's actually a remarkable success given that the rest of the health care insurance industry is an absolute mess with skyrocketing costs and not nearly enough coverage so he says no instead of doing that popular thing we're gonna cut that popular thing drive you back into the arms of he cause competition you know that is privatizing insurance how's that working out for the rest of us with prices that keep going up and up and up the government does not run insurance for people under the age of 65 private industry does and then they turn around and everyone so I'll blame the government no you're the one driving up prices and they say no no I want to make sure that happens to people above the age of 65 - this is grotesque now it's not just Paul Ryan Kevin Brady who's one of the worst of the worst he's in charge of the budget unfortunately in the house he's the head of the house and Ways and Means Committee which is the most important committee when it comes to the budget and he says welfare reform is up next okay and by welfare is he talking about what they would call handouts no but again from Inwood in the case Medicare Social Security you paid into it it's your money they're gonna rob you of that money gross beyond imagination now we go to Jeb hands early Republican from Texas the most important thing what you do with respect to the national debt he says what we need to do is obviously reform current entitlement programs for future generations ie make sure you don't get them if you're saying hey so far I've heard Medicare and I've heard Medicaid but I haven't heard Social Security yet Jay no problem can do here's Marco Rubio he says we need to institute structural changes to Social Security and Medicare for the future robbed from the average American to pay the richest American income inequality didn't happen magically it didn't happen on its own there were a set of rules that were put into place by corrupt bought off politicians that redistributed the wealth we didn't have this level of income inequality but in 1978 the Supreme Court said corporations can put money into politics and put it into the pockets of politicians and from there on they put millions and hundreds of millions then eventually billions of dollars into those pockets and slowly Jesus changed the laws to redistribute the tax burden from corporations and the rich onto the average middle class and one of the the taxes that went up as a percentage of the taxes paid was a payroll tax the rich don't even pay the payroll tax only the middle classes the poor pay it and that has gone up corporate taxes as a percentage of taxes paid overall has gone down now in this bill they're going to bring the corporate taxes down even further and redistribute the wealth to themselves and the tax burden on to you guys this is not a tax cut for you ten years from now according to their own admissions in this bill everyone making under $75,000 is going to get a tax increase let alone the fact that they're gonna cut your Social Security Medicare and Medicaid and your health care now as if all this wasn't enough one final thing and leave it to order that's to rub it in when people were concerned and they said hey wait a minute these people paid into Social Security and Medicare their whole lives now we're talking about cutting that to give a two hundred thousand dollar tax break to every millionaire in the country or it has said quote he had a rough time wanting to spend billions and billions and trillions of dollars to help people who won't help themselves won't lift a finger and expect the federal government to do everything their disdain for you is limitless if you're an average American and you pay your taxes and you work hard you bust your ass you go to work your wife goes to work your husband goes to work you guys sometimes were two jobs at a time you make if you make minimum wage god help you man that's $15,000 a year you've got to have two jobs your husband has to have a job just say if you had those three jobs you'd get all the way up to $45,000 that's one person working 80 hours a week that's another person working 40,000 f OE and they say that you're a bum and you don't want to lift a finger to help yourself but some of the rich just inherited the money not all of them but some of them they didn't do anything to get that money but for them tax break at hundreds of thousands of for several millions for guys like the Koch brothers and by the way also on the Left George Soros they make him the boogey man he's also gonna get billions of dollars in tax cuts okay now in his case he didn't ask for it the Koch brothers definitely asked for it Murtagh asked for it all the those guys the corporations ask for it but either way all of those billionaires are going to get untold amount of money for the some of them tens of billions of dollars in tax cuts but you're the bum you're the one who doesn't want to lift a finger and work hard enough if you vote for Republicans to steal your money and give it to the rich you ought to have your head examined every single Republican is voting for this in the senate bob corker voted against it everyone else including this so-called moderates which moderate republican there are no such things susan collins oh yeah that's okay i Connell told me we're not going to touch Medicare if it turns out we're touching it we're killing it we're cutting the hell out of it who cares I'm gonna vote for it anyway there are no moderate Republicans everyone in the house and everyone but one senator in the Senate all of the Republicans voted for this if you want them to keep robbing you keep voting for them look I got no love for the Democrats that might be a separate issue but if you vote for Republicans what just take your wand out and hand it to them unless you're rich in which case hey it's a good return on investment there's
