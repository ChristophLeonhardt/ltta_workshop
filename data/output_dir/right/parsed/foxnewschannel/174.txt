THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.
AINSLEY: WELCOME TO NEW YORK.
>> THANK YOU.
AINSLEY: REPUBLICANS SAYING
THEY'RE FOCUSING GETTING WALL
FUNDING DURING THE LAME-DUCK
SESSION.
>> RIGHT.
AINSLEY: IS THERE TRUTH TO THAT?
CAN THEY GET ALL THE FUNDING?
>> THE HOUSE HAS BEEN FIVE
BILLION FOR THE WALL.
EXCUSE ME, SENATE HAS
BILLION 1/2.
WE'LL CLOSE THE GAP.
DACA, REMEMBER THAT, 690,000
KIDS BROUGHT HER ON AVERAGE AGE
OF SIX.
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.
TRUMP WILL WIN IN COURT.
THE DAY HE WINS IN COURT WHAT
WILL WE DO THE YOUNG PEOPLE.
FULL WALL FUNDING FOR DACA.
BRIAN: THAT WILL BE INTERESTING.
GETTING INTO CHAIN MIGRATION.
>> NO, KEEP IT SIMPLE.
BRIAN: WE'LL SEE HOW THAT GOES.
STEVE: ONE OR ONE.
BRIAN: A GOOD THING, CONGRESS
WILL BE A DIFFICULT MAKEUP
SHORTLY.
>> MORE REPUBLICAN.
BRIAN: GUATEMALANS HEADING HERE
BIGGER THAN THE LAST CARAVAN,
WHAT DOES IT DO FOR IMMIGRATION
DEBATE AND DO FOR THE BORDER
SHORTLY?
>> MAKES THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE
MORE ON TRUMP TERMS.
THERE IS NO RIGHT TO COME TO
AMERICA.
WE CAN HAVE RULES ABOUT WHO
COMES.
WHERE IS MEXICO?
MEXICO NEED TO HELP US BECAUSE
LAST TIME I CHECKED YOU JUST
CAN'T WALK FROM GUATEMALA TO
HERE WITHOUT GOING THROUGH
MEXICO.
AINSLEY: WHY DOES IT TAKE SO
LONG?
REPUBLICANS SAY THERE NEEDS TO
BE REFORM, IMMIGRATION REFORM.
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE CRIMINAL
RECORD SHOULD COME IN VERY
QUICKLY BUT IT TAKES YEARS.
>> EVERYTHING IS A TRADEOFF.
THERE ARE 11 MILLION ILLEGAL I
AM MY GRANTS HERE CAME FROM POOR
COUNTRIES.
WHAT DO WE DO WITH THEM?
I WANT A MERIT-BASED IMMIGRATION
SYSTEM.
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
WORKING TOGETHER, BUILD A WALL,
CONTROL WHO BUILDS THE WALL THE
CAN NEVER IGNORE THE 11 MILLION,
THERE WILL NEVER BE A DEAL WITH
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT
DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE 11 MILLION
NON-FELONS BEEN HERE FOR 20, 30
YEARS, ONCE YOU GET THEM IN A
GOOD SPOT YOU CAN HAVE A NEW
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM.
STEVE: SENATOR, WE LOOK IN
MIDTERMS A COUPLE WEEKS, COUPLE
WEEKS AGO YOU WERE FRONT AND
CENTER WITH THE KAVANAUGH
HEARING.
>> YES.
STEVE: AMERICA LOOKED IN, SEEMS
LIKE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS
GAL VANNIZED.
>> THEY LOOKED IN AND SAW ME
PISSED.
STEVE: YOU WERE INDEED.
THE BIG QUESTION, DOES THE
MOMENTUM CARRY YOU THROUGH?
>> WITHOUT A DOUBT.
THIS ELECTION IS DOWN TO SIMPLE
THINGS.
ARE YOU FOR WHAT THEY DID TO
KAVANAUGH, OR HAVING YOUR
GOVERNMENT RUN BY A MOB OR RULE
OF LAW, PERSON IS PRESUMED
INNOCENT.
WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY DO YOU WANT
AND WHO YOU WANT TO RUN IT.
YOU WANT PEOPLE SPIT ON ME, YELL
AT ME BEING IN CHARGE?
OR DO YOU WANT A MORE ORDERLY
PROCESS.
JUDGE KAVANAUGH REPRESENTS THE
BEST IN OUR LEGAL COMMUNITY.
HE WAS TREATED LIKE GARBAGE,
DESPICABLE, I HOPE THEY PAY A
PRICE.
STEVE: WHO SPIT ON YOU?
>> PEOPLE OUT IN THE HALL?
>> SERIOUSLY?
>> SPIT AT ME?
BRIAN: HAZMAT WENT INTO SUSAN
COLLINS OFFICE.
>> CRAZY.
WALKING OUTSIDE, EVERY NINE
PEOPLE ARE NIGHT.
EVERY 10th ONE WANTS TO PICK
A FIGHT.
I SAW THIS ON I IMPEACHMENT.
THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE LEFT TO
YELL AT YOU, INTIMIDATE YOU.
THAT IS WHAT THIS ELECTION IS
ABOUT.
IF YOU WANT PEOPLE RUNNING THE
COUNTRY GIVE IN TO THAT.
VOTE DEMOCRAT.
BRIAN: I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT
IS LIKE.
AINSLEY: IS IT WORTH IT,
SENATOR?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
AINSLEY: WHY DO YOU PRESS ON?
>> GO TO AFGHANISTAN, GO TO
IRAQ, THESE GUYS AND GALS KEEP
TERRORISTS FROM COMING HERE.
I'M MAKING SURE CONSERVATIVE
JUDGES GET ON A COURT.
I VOTED FOR SOTOMAYOR AND KAGAN.
WHEN THEY WIN THEY GET TO
CHOOSE.
HE PICKED BEST PERSON ON THE
LIST.
BRETT KAVANAUGH.
BRIAN: SECRETARY OF STATE, YOU
KNOW, WHAT HAPPENS IN
SAUDI ARABIA, WITHOUT MBS
KNOWING IT.
STEVE: WHO IS MBS?
>> 33-YEAR-OLD CROWN PRINCE WHO
JUMPED OVER OTHER PEOPLE.
HE IS SON OF EXISTING KING.
I THINK HE IS ON A BAD TRACK.
I CAN NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH
SAUDI ARABIA AGAIN UNTIL WE GET
THIS BEHIND US.
BRIAN: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> THAT MEANS I'M NOT GOING BACK
TO SAUDI ARABIA AS LONG AS THIS
GUY IS IN CHARGE.
BRIAN: YOU'RE SAYING CROWN
PRINCE HAS TO LEAVE?
>> IT IS UP TO THEM.
I'VE BEEN THEIR BIGGEST DEFENDER
ON FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES.
THIS GUY IS A WRECKING BALL.
HE HAD THIS GUY MURDERED IN
CONSULATE IN TURKEY.
EXPECT ME TO IGNORE IT.
I FEEL USED AND ABUSED.
I WAS ON THE FLOOR EVERY TIME
DEFENDING SAUDI ARABIA BECAUSE
THERE IS GOOD ALLEY.
THERE IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A
COUNTRY AND INDIVIDUAL.
THE MBS FIGURE TO ME IS TOXIC.
HE CAN NEVER BE A WORLD LEADER
ON THE WORLD STAGE.
AINSLEY: WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT
DO?
SANCTION?
>> UP TO THE PRESIDENT.
I KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO,
WE'LL SANCTION THE HELL OUT OF
SAUDI ARABIA.
WE DEAL WITH BAD PEOPLE ALL THE
TIME.
THIS IS IN OUR FACE.
I FEEL PERSONALLY OFFENDED.
THEY HAVE OFFENDED US.
WHY WOULD YOU PUT A GUY LIKE ME
AND PRESIDENT AFTER YOU WILL THE
PRESIDENT HAS DONE?
THIS GUY HAS GOT TO GO.
A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU CAN CHOOSE
BUT MBS TAINTED YOUR COUNTRY
AND.
BRIAN: WHAT DO THEY DO TO
REPLACE HIM?
>> THAT IS NOT MY JOB.
THERE ARE A BUNCH OF THEM.
STEVE: HUNDREDS.
>> YOUR JOB, NOT MINE.
ON THAT CHEERY NOTE.
STEVE: ONE OF THE TOP STORIES IN
THE WORLD, LIZ BET WARREN, DNA
TEST, COULD BE ANYWHERE FROM
1/64 TO 1/THOUSAND
NATIVE-AMERICAN.
>> I WILL TAKE A DNA TEST.
I'VE BEEN TOLD MY GRANDMOTHER
MAY PART CHEROKEE INDIAN.
IT MAY BE JUST TALK.
YOU WILL FIND OUT IN COUPLE
WEEKS I WILL TAKE THE TEST.
STEVE: YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE IT.
>> I WILL TAKE IT.
RESULTS WILL BE REVEALED HERE.
THIS IS MY TRUMP MOMENT.
THIS IS REALITY TV.
I'M DYING TO KNOW.
I DIDN'T REALLY THINK MUCH ABOUT
IT.
BUT SHE IS LESS THAN .1 OF 1%.
I THINK CAN BEAT HER.
BRIAN: IF YOU BEAT HER WILL YOU
ASK FOR A MILLION DOLLARS FROM
THE PRESIDENT?
>> I WANT A CAN EVEN KNOW AND
MILLION BUCKS.
STEVE: CASINO ON THE LINE.
AINSLEY: PASTOR BRUNSON FROM
NORTH CAROLINA.
CAME BACK.
>> GOD LESS HIM.
AINSLEY: WHAT IS YOUR REACTION.
>> PRESIDENT DID A GREAT JOB.
HE SHOULD NEVER BEEN IN JAIL.
BETTER DAYS FOR TURKEY,
SAUDI ARABIA, ONLY WAY FOR
BETTER DAY, CLEAN UP THE MESS
THEY CREATED.
BRIAN: PRESIDENT IS GETTING
BETTER AND BETTER BEING
PRESIDENT.

>> HE TOLD ME WAS GETTING
BETTER.
HE IS HAVING SO MUCH FUN.
HE IS ROCKIN' IT KEEP IT UP,

BRIAN: GREAT PEOPLE.
