we have developed a very special bond best not make any more threats to the United States they will be met with fire and fury and have madmen out there shooting rockets all over the place you will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea Rocket Man is a sick puppy a frightened dog barks louder I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged u.s. dotted with fire as history has proven over and over again adversaries can indeed become friends both very honored to sign the document thank you today we had an historic meeting and decided to leave the past behind we're very proud of what took place today that worked out for both of us far better than anybody even predicted it's an honor to be with you I'll despite the two seeming to get on well Chairman Kim did look a little taken aback by one of president Trump's jokes Donald Trump wrapped up the summit in Singapore with an hour-long news briefing outlining his position on a number of issues calum open talks us through what he said and how its led some to question whether North Korea is right to trust him they've agreed to four basic points that were in the document that was signed by the President of the United States and the leader of North Korea first they agreed to a new u.s. DPRK relationship a new relationship between the two countries secondly they agreed to a lasting stable peace and working toward to facilitating a lasting stable peace on the Korean Peninsula they agreed to to commitment to denuclearization getting rid of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula and finally they did agree to return the bodies of POWs missing in action that the bodies of American soldiers who had died during the Korean War or the bodies of American soldiers in the Korean Peninsula those were the four points of agreement now speaking in his press conference following the meeting Donald Trump did clarify some things he first of all he said that they will not be lifting the sanctions until until there is a full denuclearization of the peninsula Donald Trump said he looked forward to lifting the sanctions but they will not be lifting the sanctions at the moment furthermore Trump said that they would be stopping the war games the the military exercises that North Korea has often said are very threatening to them and are essentially rehearsing for their destruction these military exercises will be stopped Donald Trump said that they were very expensive and very provocative and from there we we heard it some more talk about what would go on on the peninsula itself this is Donald Trump we're not reducing anything we're not reduce very little bit early for that we have to get things moving the sanctions will remain in effect we will be stopping the war games unless and until we see the the future negotiation is not going along like it should so you're saying there that the the number of troops on the Korean Peninsula will not be reduced at the moment now from there Donald Trump talks about the previous administration's and their record in dealing with North Korea and how difficult it was to make this meeting this historic meeting you know between two countries that have been basically at war with each other in a legal sense for the last sixty years how difficult it was to make this meeting happen this is Donald Trump talking about previous administrations and the difficulties they proceeded down a path in the past and ultimately as you know nothing got done in one case they took billions of dollars during the Clinton regime took billions of dollars and nothing happened that was a terrible thing and he actually brought it up to me I don't think they've ever had the confidence frankly in a president that they have right now for getting things done and having the ability to get things done well there's obviously a huge amount of optimism around the world in the aftermath of this historic meeting however there are different voices asking how how optimistic we really should be fo'c'sle recalling that Donald Trump did pull the u.s. out of the historic Iran joint plan of action the nuclear deal other people are wondering exactly how this dudn't denuclearization is going to take place with the sanctions not yet being lifted with you know troops remaining on the peninsula quite a journey to get here though the talks were first announced back in March but then by make in voiced his anger over military drills between South Korea and the US and threatened to call it all off then nine days later Trump canceled the meeting accusing Kim of hostility but the next day the White House and Pyongyang said things were back on track by the 1st of June Washington officially announced that the summit would go ahead after also quite the roller coaster you
