1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,040
Among the top 10 most valuable tech companies
globally are two China tech giants…

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,140
with many more up and coming startups making their
presence felt.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,020
The industry has become a serious rival to
Silicon Valley, but there are political hurdles ahead.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,340
This is your Bloomberg QuickTake on China’s
tech giants.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,900
Early on, Chinese companies like Tencent had
a reputation for being copycats.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:29,240
Its QQ instant messaging app originally looked a lot
like icq - a popular messaging app used in the U.S.

7
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,960
Comparisons are now harder to make.

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,609
Tencent’s 1 billion strong messaging app
WeChat has grown from simply a texting app,

9
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:03,070
to a platform for shopping, flirting, dating,
watching videos, playing games, and ordering

10
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,500
food and taxis…

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,640
There’s no U.S. equivalent.

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,170
Since the introduction of the internet in
China, the government has controlled the web

13
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,030
with a complex system of censors and gateways
known as The Great Firewall.

14
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,110
This has effectively quarantined China’s
technology ecosystem, blocking access to the

15
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,530
likes of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

16
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,240
That’s enabled locals to develop services
without competition from abroad and build

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,130
platforms with a uniquely Chinese flavor.

18
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,970
And because of China’s large population,
whos internet users more than double the entire

19
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:38,850
U.S. population... the companies grew to be
massive.

20
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,360
They became so successful that some U.S. companies
are taking note.

21
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,860
But there’s increasing pushback.

22
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,670
Donald Trump: “China...they’re draining
us, they’re taking our money, they’re

23
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,310
rebuilding themselves...”

24
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,630
President Donald Trump says China is stealing
overseas know-how and has imposed tariffs.

25
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,320
Bloomberg Businessweek uncovered that the
Chinese even planted chips in computers for

26
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,360
potential hardware hacks.

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,230
Yet Chinese tech company names that only recently
drew blank stares outside China are becoming

28
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,420
increasingly familiar.

29
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,030
Take Huawei,

30
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,330
it reached a pinnacle in 2018 by overtaking
Apple in smartphone share globally.

31
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,820
But for China’s big tech companies to keep
expanding, they’ll need to convince other

32
00:02:46,820 --> 00:00:00,000
nations that they mean no harm.
