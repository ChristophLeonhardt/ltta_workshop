turkey is threatening to break the legs of Greek officials as the two countries reopen or out of the sovereignty of two small islands Athens will feel the anger of Turkey we will break the arms and legs of any officers of the prime minister or of any minister who dares to step onto Emir in the Aegean unspeakable statements like these are alien to European political culture we have said this before it should know their place additionally we would like to remind him that the legal status of the Aegean is clear and guaranteed by international law here on the map you can see the uninhabited territories being disputed over Turkey has made recent incursions towards the islands after a Greek court denied the extradition of eight men Ankara says were involved in the failed coup last year originally the hours were part of the Ottoman Empire but have long been recognized by the EU as Greek the sovereignty issue ignited back in December 1995 when a Turkish boat ran a Greek vessel ashore it was a followed by a succession of Turkish and Greek attempts to remove each other's flags from the islands even by journalists former Belgian Parliament member and political expert load even Oost says he's not surprised by the route between Athens and Ankara Turkey and Greece have a past of military conflict I mean in the seventies they were even at war at some point it's not a surprise that these two NATO member states are in such a situation fornetti you won't make that much of a difference of course the other countries are very worried that this might get out of hand you know that of course they do not like to NATO members at war but NATO has always survives these kind of skirmishes especially in Greece and Turkey we should not forget that all rhetoric aside NATO always never bought democracy and human rights I mean when NATO was founded which was a military dictatorship and Turkey was a military dictator that did not him the NATO membership so I think on the whole things will go on as usual it's just the only thing that we have to take care of is that this does not get out of hand this can always happen of course
