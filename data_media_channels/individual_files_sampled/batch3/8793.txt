WE'RE JOINED BY PAUL FROM JOHANNESBURG. FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP IS SAYING SHE WANTS THIS TRIP TO BE MEANINGFUL AND ON DAY TWO OF A FOUR-COUNTRY SWING ACROSS THE AFRICAN CONTINENT THE FIRST LADY APPEARED TO USE WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN SEEN AS JUST A HISTORICAL TOURIST TIME-OUT INTO SPOERGT SUPPORT FOR ONE OF HER HUSBAND'S A FORMER HOLDING FACILITY FOR AFRICAN SLAVES. THE PRESIDENT UNDERTOOK HIS ADMINISTRATION IS FOCUSING ON AN ENDING THE ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC PRACTICE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. SIMPLY PUT THE MODERN PHRASE FOR SLAVERY. SLAVES WAITED UNTIL THEY WERE FORCED THROUGH THE DOOR OF NO RETURN AND ONTO SHIPS TO BE TAKEN TO AMERICA. THE FIRST LADY WAS CLEARLY DISTURBED BY WHAT SHE SAW HERE TELLING REPORTERS IT'S A TRAGEDY. ONE INSIDER TOLD US THE FIRST LADY TRIP WORKS FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ON SEVERAL LEVELS. TAKES SOME FOCUS OFF HER
