1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
HOW DID SHE DO IT??

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,220
Today we want to talk about transformations,

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,480
because we posted a picture on Instagram,

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,100
this one here, it is a incredible transformation of Mama Bee

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,020
and a lot of you guys have asked us on Instagram:

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,700
how did she do it, what's the secret,

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,500
are there any diets, what are the tips.

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,100
So here we are to talk about some things that Mama Bee that has done that has changed her life.

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,920
Phsically and mentally.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,040
Ok, Mama Bee take it away, cause you have notes.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,900
She has notes, I don't have notes.

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,960
You'll never see me doing a video on makeup tutorials or fashion,

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,040
2 things I have no idea about,

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,840
but getting healthy and getting your life back on track

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,160
and living your best life

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,620
I'm doing a lot of work on myself, so if I can help you

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,460
- That would be awesome.
- Those are the notes that she's looking at.

18
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,980
She's very prepared, this is why I marry her, because she's prepared, and now she's pinching me!

19
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:57,935
There's nothing wrong in being a lifelong student in life.

20
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:00,345
And now she's caressing me and scratching my back.

21
00:01:00,345 --> 00:01:02,200
You don't have to take any of our advice.

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,000
Furthermore, we're not actually selling anything in this video

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,660
No sales, no crazy diets, no profit

24
00:01:08,665 --> 00:01:11,760
Other than the ad that played before this video started.

25
00:01:11,765 --> 00:01:14,285
- Well you know, we've gotta eat
- We've gotta eat!

26
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:17,065
So this is more like an educational video

27
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:20,045
for people out there that we wanna help and want to inspire.

28
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:25,000
We would love for you to post pictures of yourself and tag us,

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,865
if you have decided to change your life, so you have to

30
00:01:28,865 --> 00:01:31,675
make that decision first for yourself none can make

31
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,665
that decision for you, but if you do get started, please

32
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:37,665
- let us know, let us be part of your journey
- let us know, tag us on Instagram

33
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:40,525
tag us on twitter, @EhBeeFamily

34
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:43,855
- There it is, ok.
- Ok, three things.

35
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:46,825
Very simple, nothing complicated, no secrets

36
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:49,845
Number one is DIET.

37
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:52,945
I hate the word "diet", "diet" to me means restrictions.

38
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:55,975
I don't restric myself of anything

39
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:59,045
I love having fast food, fried food, desert,

40
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:01,985
but I do it in moderation. Let's say

41
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:04,345
"eating habits" instead.

42
00:02:04,345 --> 00:02:07,115
So i like the term "eating habits", because then you're not restricting yourself,

43
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,259
you're not putting any pressure on yourself, your're making healthy choices

44
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,800
most of the time

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,240
80% of the time, we eat lean protein.

46
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,115
We eat a lot of fish, beans, I'll make

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,160
like bean stews with ground turkey or we have tofu.

48
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,140
For example, today, we came back from the gym

49
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,820
and we had this:

50
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,895
Mama Bee made salmon, tofu, some beans,

51
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:33,935
a nice balanced salad, we're drinking water.

52
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:36,645
Blackberries, yet some chicken,

53
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:39,260
there's no sauce on the chicken, this is just roasted chicken

54
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,200
sea weed salad... Would I love to

55
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,100
have a cheesburger and fries

56
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:47,305
Absolutely! You can have all those foods

57
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:50,055
we eat all of those foods, but we do it

58
00:02:50,055 --> 00:02:52,265
in moderation, so we will treat ourselves

59
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:55,275
once or twice a week, versus eating

60
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,035
that kind of food 7 days a week. If you are

61
00:02:58,035 --> 00:03:00,725
intaking too many caloris that you don't need

62
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:03,525
your body doesn't need, your body's gonna store that as fat

63
00:03:03,565 --> 00:03:06,555
So it's very simple guys. When you go to that

64
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:09,315
supermarket, there's the cali and the tomatoes

65
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:12,165
and the lettuce and the spinach

66
00:03:12,165 --> 00:03:15,205
and the brown rice, instead of the white rice,

67
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:18,405
oatmeal, that's what we eat most of the time, some Saturday mornigs

68
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:21,325
we'll wake up, "Let's go for breakfast", guess what

69
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:23,715
we're having, we're having wafles, we're having syrop

70
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:26,815
pancakes, we're slamming the bacon

71
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:29,575
- slamming the home fries
- we're like eating it all

72
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:32,915
and then with icing sugar on top

73
00:03:32,915 --> 00:03:35,945
it's balanced, and its about portion sizes

74
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:39,145
- Just having control.
- And one thing we feel

75
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:40,705
really strongly about

76
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:44,275
Soda. We do not drink soda. I used to.

77
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:47,325
If you eliminate soda from your life, i don't care

78
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:50,355
if it's diet or if its' ice tea

79
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,195
or whatever - any type of sugar soda

80
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:56,195
with high fructose corn syrop, the fake sugars and stuff

81
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:59,365
All that stuff your body doesn't know what to do with it, turns it into fat, so...

82
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,975
if you have challanges with your weight

83
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,795
and you drink soda, eliminate soda for 30 days.

84
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:07,805
- Starting now. Don't drink it.
- You know that

85
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:11,115
bottle or can that you have in front of you right now

86
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,525
Walk over to the toilet

87
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:16,235
- And dump it.
- Just dump it. Don't put it

88
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:19,185
into your body. If you're drinking coffee, please don't put

89
00:04:19,185 --> 00:04:22,335
6 creams and 6 sugars in your coffee

90
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:24,615
A little bit of milk, maybe 1 sugar

91
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:27,265
Once you start reducing the sugar your body will adjust

92
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:30,515
Get rid of soda, get rid of any sugary drinks and

93
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:33,345
only drink water for 30 days and see

94
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:36,225
the difference . Tweet us back, let us know.

95
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:39,005
Sorry, guys, we're just being honest.

96
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:42,045
People don't want to hear the truth. When you tell the truth

97
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:45,185
people call you controversial. We know what it was like

98
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:48,145
when we were consuming enormous quantities of

99
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:51,425
soda, might we go to a birthday party and have

100
00:04:51,695 --> 00:04:55,065
a can of soda, once a month, yeah, we probably will

101
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:57,995
it's cold, it's in a cooler, there's ice around it

102
00:04:57,995 --> 00:05:00,935
you know that you're gonna crack that can open and it's gonna taste really good

103
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:03,785
most of the time, we've disciplined our mind

104
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:06,655
- to make a right choices
- Also another big thing befoer

105
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:09,835
we get to the point #2 - breads. Breads,

106
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:12,575
crossaints, muffins,

107
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,645
bagles, bagguettes,

108
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:18,475
- Like with the butter.
- The crulers and the donuts

109
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:21,075
with that pretzel bread.

110
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:24,805
The cinamon pretzel!

111
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:28,495
Cinamon pretzel, big cinamon pretzels! Just cut down.

112
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:30,325
Cut down.

113
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:33,125
Numero dos!

114
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,045
So these are the three thing we're telling you guys, i've put a lot of work into this.

115
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:37,080
Alright, she's got the notes.

116
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,440
The dreaded word...

117
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,340
EXERCISEEE!!!

118
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:48,605
Sweating! Exercise is a

119
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:51,645
one million percent

120
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:54,495
- must.
- Getting your heart rate up whether is riding a bike

121
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:57,425
whether is running, but you have to sweat, you have to get

122
00:05:57,425 --> 00:06:00,115
your heart rate up. You can't just go out and just walk around.

123
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:03,135
No, you need to run, you need to jog, you need to ride a bike.

124
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:06,165
They haven't exercised for years and then they start to exercise

125
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:09,265
and they're like OMG, this is hard, i can't do this!

126
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:12,345
Yeah, it's hard! It's really hard!

127
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:15,205
- You have to work hard!
- You have to gasp, you have be feeling like

128
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:18,095
"I don't wanna do this!", but just keep going.

129
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:21,165
Keep going, you've gotta exercise, 3-5 times a week

130
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:24,115
for maybe half an hour, to 45 min

131
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:27,235
a day, if you can do that, it's like taking a shower.

132
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:30,315
- Well, i take a shower, it takes me 30 min.
- I know a lot of people

133
00:06:30,315 --> 00:06:33,605
- sitting on their phones
- Lot of people texting! For 30 min!

134
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:36,875
That can be used for something else to make yourself stronger.

135
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,685
So lot of people say:  "Why, I don't have the time,

136
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:42,505
I've got kids, I've got to work, I've got a job" - you wake up early.

137
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:45,285
It's your body. I would wake up at 6.00 AM

138
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:48,135
6.30 AM, i would work out at 11.00 o'clock at night

139
00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:51,215
Whenever i could, i would take half an hour

140
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:54,565
maybe 45 min, and just run and sweat

141
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:56,845
and do whatever it takes to just

142
00:06:56,845 --> 00:06:59,465
get my heart rate up. Talk to a doctor.

143
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:02,635
The doctor would say the exact same thign, yes, you need to exercise

144
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:05,205
- and this is what you can do.
- When you first start to

145
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:08,205
exercise and you haven't exercised in years

146
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:11,185
you are going to want to give up

147
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:13,945
Because you think "I can't do this, i can't even do 3 sit-ups

148
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:16,765
Well, you're gonna build now, so

149
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:19,985
today you're gonna do 2 sit-ups, and then the day after you're gonna do 3 sit-ups

150
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:22,965
And than maybe in a week you're gonna do 4 sit-ups

151
00:07:22,965 --> 00:07:25,685
But it's that progression, that you're looking at

152
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:27,065
Day 1, you're gonna wanna

153
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:28,995
You might get sick.

154
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,355
but then tommorow it's gonna

155
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:35,375
get better and its gonna get better, so don't give up, even the elite

156
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:38,475
athletes, in our crossfit gym, when they're done

157
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:41,305
their workout, they're on the ground

158
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:44,275
We have friends that are the olympic swimmers, olympic swimmers!

159
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:47,455
Incredible shape, and when they're finished working out, they're on the ground.

160
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,445
And Mama Bee is just starring at them while they're glicing on the gourn and...

161
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,700
Shadow to nemo, I'm married, i am blind!

162
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,315
No. 3 is... MINDSET.

163
00:07:58,315 --> 00:07:59,335
Mindset.

164
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:02,695
And that starts with self-care

165
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:05,805
and self-love. I love myself so much that

166
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:08,095
I'm gonna do this for myself, no matter what it takes

167
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:10,915
even if i have to sleepless night. So the #1

168
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:13,545
thing that you're gonna do when it comes to mindset is you'r gonna start

169
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:16,935
to love yourself, and you're gonna do things for yourself

170
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:19,875
And you're gonna start to really take a hard look at

171
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,755
the people in your life, who are the healthy people for you

172
00:08:22,755 --> 00:08:25,185
So for us, we have a lot of friends

173
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:28,205
at our crossfit gym, and they're super-positive

174
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:31,145
they are inspiring, they have the most

175
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:34,265
amazing things to say, they want us

176
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:37,005
to do well, they're constantly pushing us

177
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:39,835
- and bringing up the best in us.
- If you have a friend who'se also

178
00:08:39,835 --> 00:08:42,735
looking to improve , then work with them,even better

179
00:08:42,735 --> 00:08:45,725
go thogether, just get out there and run

180
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,835
- and sweat.
- One of my closest friends, Amy,

181
00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:51,285
i've had the best times with

182
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:54,285
because we would wake up on a Sunday morning, sit and have coffee for an hour

183
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:57,465
together, chat, then we would do

184
00:08:57,465 --> 00:09:00,185
two classes of yoga, it was just amazing to be able

185
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:03,255
to share that with someone, share something that I love

186
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:05,135
with someone that i love

187
00:09:05,135 --> 00:09:08,115
That's an amazing feeling, so try to surround yourself with people like that

188
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:10,395
and understand the difference between love

189
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:13,725
versus attachment. Through our life

190
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:16,765
we make attachments with people along the way

191
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,495
but there're certain point in your life when you need to make

192
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,020
a few detachments, and you're gonna upset

193
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,415
some people, but that's the only way

194
00:09:24,415 --> 00:09:27,175
for you to really grow, and to continouly surrond

195
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:30,045
yourself with people that make you better

196
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:32,895
and now want the best for you.
- So there it is guys.

197
00:09:32,895 --> 00:09:35,935
Those are the 3 main things, so:

198
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:38,615
Eating habits, exercise, mindset.

199
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:41,595
There are 3 thigns that both of us have actually worked on that transformed

200
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:44,095
our lives.

201
00:09:44,345 --> 00:09:47,615
Oh, and this is a secret tip - after you take a shower, and dry you hair, whatever.

202
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,675
don't dry the water on your body.

203
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
- Really??
- Yeah.

204
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,260
Why?

205
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:56,665
Because, that's a good moisture for your skin.

206
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:59,775
And you can use coconut oil as well.

207
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:02,135
So this is like an extra tip

208
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,485
She smells like oranges and coconut oil.

209
00:10:05,795 --> 00:10:08,545
- She smells delightful.
- So after you shower...

210
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,955
...don't towel-dry yourself.

211
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:14,145
Just stand there for 10 minutes

212
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:16,945
if you have the time, if not just...
- I'm telling you....
