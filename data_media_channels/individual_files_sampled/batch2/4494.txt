de 558 of the Trump administration and day one of the Paul Manafort trial the first big test for Robert Muller it is a trial about taxes and not Russia though Russia looms large in the background as it seems to and everything else these days mana forts being tried in federal court in Alexandria Virginia he was of course Trump's campaign chairman ran the RNC convention it's the first of two trials for him in this one he's looking at 18 counts of bank fraud tax evasion conspiracy charges in relation to his work for a pro-russian party in Ukraine before he went to work for the Trump campaign he has pleaded not guilty to all charges this trial is off to a lightning start so far a jury has been seated opening statements have been delivered in a witness has testified all on day one metaphor was a March to August chairman back in 2016 he helped Trump secure the nomination make no mistake and Trump said so at the time I have fantastic people Paul Manafort just came on he's great he doesn't have to do this like I don't have to he didn't need to do this but he wanted to Paul Menna Ford has done an amazing job he's here someplace where's Paul Paul man however more recently as men affort was awaiting trial the president sought to shall we say diminish his former campaign Chairman's role I know mr. Madoff what haven't spoken of in a long time but I know he was with the campaign as you know for a very short period of time I tell you I feel a little badly about if they went back 12 years to get things that he did 12 years ago you know what man afford worked for me for a very short period of time he worked for me what 449 days or something a very short period of time manna fort is the highest-ranking campaign figure charged so far he was also part of that 2016 Trump Tower meeting when Donald Trump jr. and Jared Kushner had those Russians come by also tonight multiple sources tell NBC News that Robert Muller has referred another group of Investigations to federal prosecutors up here in New York the Southern District of New York those sources say that former lobbyist Tony pizzette Podesta former Minnesota Republican congressman VIN Weber and former Obama White House Counsel Greg Craig are all under federal investigation the sources also say the inquiry into Tony Podesta whose brother John ran the Clinton campaign of course stems from Muller's investigation into the case of Paul Manafort as the special counsel and his team continue their inquiries the president is now embracing a new line of defense as we covered here last night and as floated out yesterday by Rudy Giuliani this morning Trump wrote on Twitter quote collusion is not a crime but that doesn't matter because there was no collusion except by crooked Hillary and the Democrats let us bring in our leadoff panel for a Tuesday night Josh Gerstein was inside the courtroom today for today's proceedings he is senior White House reporter for Politico also our very newest MSNBC contributor Cynthia auxin is back with us a former federal prosecutor and a veteran of the Civil Rights Division at DOJ and Sam Stein is back with us politics editor at The Daily Beast so Josh tone and tenor of day one so far what was the dynamic like in the courtroom well it was quite surprising I think to see the vigor with which Rick case was thrown under the bus by Paul manna forts campaign team I should say his defense team we were all expecting that there would be an effort to dirty gates up as a witness but to suggest as manna Ford's attorneys did that the entire enterprise that the government was alleging essentially all of the fraud the whole Special Counsel case stands on the shoulders of Rick Gates was a rather startling argument to hear from mana Ford's team and that was in fact the central a thrust of their defense we had a pretty good sense of what prosecutors were gonna say and and how they were gonna blame mana for for what took place here and described the luxury goods that he was indulging in and often paying for with transfers that came directly from bank accounts in shell company names in places like Cyprus and the Grenadines but the defense was a little more surprising and and they made this argument that somehow man of Ford's deputy had duped him into any wrongdoing that took place there listing all the items of his lavish lifestyle the big one that broke through today in the news media was a correct me if I'm wrong $15,000 ostrich jacket of course who among us hasn't owned one of those in the past right and the the the sums are significant especially when you add them up I mean the ostrich jacket is a colorful item but they're talking about him spending something on the order of maybe eight hundred thousand or a million dollars on suits over a few years period so it's a pretty dramatic level of spending the suit he was wearing in the courtroom today did not look quite as fancy Cynthia I've two questions lead off for you one is purely mechanical I've covered a number of trials I think we've all been on jury duty how in the world did they seat a jury have opening statements and already hear from one witness in the course of a day well it's the Eastern District of Virginia and they're not fooling around I mean they're not they're called the rocket docket for a reason and usually you know after you seat the jury you might have a little bit of a break but no it was stand up and let's do opening statements and then call your first witness that's just the way it goes in the Eastern District of Virginia there's a second question to you is about this defense case how tough is that we just heard Josh lay out the fact that they're gonna go after the star witness well yes they are because what else are they gonna do in prosecutorial circles all around the country this would be referred to as the so died defense some other dude did it and that's that's what we that's the sort of our shorthand they don't really have much else to do and the problem for them is it's a paper case and man afford signature is all over things and it's not probably not going to work it doesn't usually work and I would doubt it works in this case Sam I want to read you a quote from Frank Bruni's New York Times column entitled Paul Manafort trial is Donald Trump's - and the quote is Manta Ford is such a gilded sordid reminder of the company that Trump keeps and of how he sees and navigates the world it is true Sam he has represented unsavory x' all over the world it is also true this case is not about Russia and it's true that Russia is the backdrop for all of it yeah it's a weird it's a weird thing happening here in which you have obviously the former chairman of the Trump campaign and right in the middle of a very high profile obviously controversial trial and Donald Trump's name wasn't mentioned today Robert Mahler's name wasn't mentioned today this trial does not have to do with any conduct in the 2016 campaign nor does Rick gates involvement dovetail with what he did in the 2016 campaign or his work on the inaugural committee it is a highly separate trial involving past clients of Paul manna forts and I think if we're reading between the lines it is the prelude to something that's supposed to be bigger obviously the prosecutors have a case that they're bringing here but it does seem like they're looking down the road to try to get or compel Paul Manafort to participate in the larger mission which is the investigation into collusion in the Trump campaign and we're all sort of waiting to see what pinafore does under this type of pressure I do agree that the case the defense he's bringing seems highly uncompelled basically he's saying my underling did all this without my knowledge Paul Manafort is begging the jury to believe a story the prosecutors are telling them here are the receipts and so he's got a really bad card to playing if he's still playing it and it all begs the question why well what do why is he not trying to get some bigger deal done with Robert Walsh team and I don't know if there are our great answer to this other than he's waiting for potentially a pardon down the road hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
