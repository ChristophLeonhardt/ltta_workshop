the left has declared it will no longer act with civility as if it ever acted with civility in the first place or had even the slightest idea what civility means meanwhile the president is telling

are saying we're not going to be civil any more week what is civility Republicans you're not civil Democrats you're not civil and you're not nice and your civility and nice things are totally different and one aspect that they're missing about civility is manliness manliness and what better way to start off a conversation about manliness then to get an update on the World Cup you know the manliest game of all so we turn out of our sister network daily wire to and chief soccer sports correspondent Jeremy the god-king boring Jeremy bada-boom thank you Michael mich AAL it's good to be with you after what sports commentators all over the world are calling the most intense weekend of sweaty athletic men not scoring since Thermopylae yes I am talking about the FEMA World Cup for our American viewers that's the once every four years global sporting event that doesn't involve curling or figure skating or bombing Iraq in the most shocking match of the weekend or away with the GDP literally lower than Bill Gates defeated recent global superpower Russia by a staggering three points those being the only three points scored in the match after Tom Arnold responded to the match by promising to deliver never-before-seen video of US president Donald Trump covered in urine praising Russia on its near win and reminding his constituents that America isn't much better than said soccer if you really think about it hurgh ways coach responded to the alleged video by dying mysteriously of polonium poisoning in the all-important Group F this weekend saw Mexico GDP one point zero four trillion edged out South Korea GDP one point four trillion to one while Germany GDP three point four trillion defeated Sweden five hundred and eleven billion dollars by the same score you know what that means for Group F right Michael of what does that mean Jeremy yeah why would anyone know the answer to that well I was hoping you knew of course the most anticipated match of the day today is between one of the most gay friendly countries in Europe Portugal GDP 200 billion and nuclear wannabes and throwers of gaze off of cranes array of GDP 393 billion a quarter of which was a gift from John Kerry Iran has promised that their football program is only intended for peaceful purposes and that the fact that it fits neatly on the head of one of their enormous intercontinental ballistic missiles is strictly coincidental and also a lie told by the Great Satan who they hope dies but whom they mean no personal harm as they are a peaceful nation the beautiful sport the beautiful sport indeed but of course soccer isn't really Michael about who wins and who loses it's really about women thinking men with accents and zero body fat and stripy shorts are cute and everyone else rebuking America capitalism Western hegemony masculinity adulthood and Jesus either seriously Jesus never watched a single World Cup you can look it up that's in the Bible in the Bible evidence of this can be seen in much of the reporting on the world cup medium.com put out a list of 10 reasons you should watch the World Cup reason number 1 Team USA isn't in it take that America reason number 3 it's a great medicine against American arrogance al.com and there are five reasons you should be watching the World Cup said it's a true World Cup you guys four billion people cannot be wrong fortunately for our audience at home we here at daily wire to did an in-depth investigation into the question of whether or not for a billion people can be wrong and discovered this shocking information this is a map of all of the nations in the world that love soccer and this is a map of all of the nations in the world that have landed a man on the moon and returned him safely back to earth that's right losers it's America won everybody else zero a score soccer lovers the world over should be able to get their heads around Michael but a boom what do you Jeremy that is some incredible in-depth research that you have done I did have a question about the Iranian soccer game so do we have any information on whether all of the sanctions against Iran the international sanctions have prohibited Ford and Chrysler minivans from pulling up to the stadium there and picking up the children from the game you know interestingly enough Michael soccer moms in Iran actually are well equipped and in other good international news soccer moms in Saudi Arabia are now actually legally allowed to drive to the field to pick up those adorable six-year-olds as they learn basic motor skills that that is really wonderful I'm so glad that those World Cup players will now be able to get their juice boxes in some of those countries where heretofore the soccer moms couldn't drive Jeremy the god-king boring what an incredible recap I look forward to hearing more are you gonna be watching more of the games watching but upon Jeremy the god-king boring everybody really important update they're really really I thought it was gonna be able to make it through that with a straight face years and years of conservatory training not a chance absolutely not really good stuff I got to tell you the World Cup was kind of bothering me you know because I don't it I went to my favorite bagel place in LA this weekend my one refuge I thought from the kind of LAPC hippie dippie stuff I go to buy a bagel and what do I see - giant TVs with the World Cup on a big sign it says the place to watch the World Cup your bagel place and I think okay but watching those updates I think I'm really starting to change my opinion I'm getting a real kick out of this World Cup okay so moving on from you know the manliest sport the beautiful game of soccer let's start talking about manliness here because manliness is is the question of this you know Donald Trump saying act like a man Jimmy Kimmel and then people saying you're not being civil you're not what is this what it okay it's manliness and womanliness or misunderstood across the political spectrum and it's playing out in our politics you're seeing it in politics you're seeing it on TV you're seeing it in movies we're gonna we're gonna get to the incredibles by the end but feminism totally destroyed Incredibles - and it's really sad this misunderstanding of what of what manliness is over the weekend we'll begin with Donald Trump and Jimmy Jimmy Fallon and then we'll be able to move into I think Maxine Waters and Sarah Sanders getting kicked out of that restaurant and why that cartoon wasn't any good over the weekend here's where it began Donald Trump gave Jimmy Fallon important advice here's the exchange do we know if Donald Trump is part Italian he looked he looked very Italian in that photo that no I was actually I apparently that was a recreation that was Marlon Brando and was an Al Martino who played Johnny Fontane somebody yeah really I think they really captured the essence the era of President Trump and Jimmy Fallon Jimmy Fallon has been complaining for a little while over how mean the left was to him after he did that interview you remember he did an interview with Donald Trump on his show during the campaign and he kind of rubbed his hair he said I've got a question for you is your hair real and he says touch the hair and he goes rubs it oh the hair is real right just classic a Jimmy Fallon show you know Jimmy Fallon is the nice guy Stephen Colbert he's the left-wing political guy and Jimmy Kimmel he's the everyman your average Joe but he's a left winger too right and Jimmy Fallon's dick is that he's the nice guy and everybody likes him and he's not gonna ask you about abortion he's just gonna play games with you on his show you know he started playing board games with his guests and things like that Don Rickles was asked if he'd ever been on the Jimmy Fallon show he said no yes to learn how to play Jenga first you know I mean that's that's the tenor of Jimmy Fallon show so he has Trump on in plays with his hair and then by the way he had Hillary Clinton on the next week and he played stupid games with her too and it's just oh nice nice nice and he got eviscerated for this by the left not the right that was attacking him it was the left they said you're normalizing Trump as though the nominee of the Republican Party is and hasn't been normalized as though the guy that we've all known for 40 years in the pop culture he hasn't been normalized until Jimmy Fallon scratches him on the scalp then all of a sudden he's a real threat so they were so mean to him and it kind of broke the guy that this is gonna play an important role a little later in the discussion between the difference between civility and niceness because Jimmy Fallon man he's just a nice guy here is Jimmy Fallon just crying basically really upset and complaining about what the left did to him after he talked to Trump on the show I'm just doing five hours a week and I'm like working I get in at you know 10 the morning I work till it's 7:00 at night I'm just trying to make a funny show you know the grind so you know and you know me I should have been worried when we were number one and whatever so I never cared about that I never will I just want to make sure we had the best show possible yeah but it was definitely a down time and it's tough for morale for you know people is 300 people that work here and so people talking that bad about in ganging up onion really gang mentality on blow it was insane it was a people you wouldn't expect and your sensitive guy you go what you cook all right we get it I heard you right you made me feel bad so now what are you happy you I'm depressed do you want to push me more what do you do I know what I mean you let me kill myself what would make you happy get over it you've said your only regret about it really is that you didn't speak to quell the issue sooner is that right yeah I probably should just talked and just done interviews immediately after your like I don't dude I don't believe in well you don't do a lot of interviews and politicians I don't but it's like I hope to talk to you every night right why would I be on a show I'd the fact you know hopefully people do it in but I go yeah I'm sorry I don't want to make anyone angry and that's it there all he says pretty cool actually sort of feel bad for the guy because he didn't sign up for this he's actually trying to keep his late-night show nonpartisan but he said they all ganged up on me and the left loves ganging up these days the gang they first of all they're defending ms-13 they're defending one of the worst gangs in the world violent gangs then they can't you know Maxine Waters are saying gang up on it when you see someone gang up that that woman who owns the restaurant the Red Hen in Lexington Virginia said gang up on Sarah Sanders go gang up on her you will get to that in a minute he's seeing that oh they're all getting ganged up on me and that's what the left does they do gang up but that's just the way it is so of course president Trump responds here in his very trumpian way he says Jimmy Fallon is now whimpering that all he had that he did the famous hair show with me where he seriously messed up my hair and that he would have now done it differently because it is said to have humanized me he's taking heat he called and said monster ratings be a man Jimmy be a man Jimmy so of course it is kind of funny you know cuz he says he messed up my hair be a man right now that is a kind of funny juxtaposition but that last advice in there be a man Jimmy is really important it's something to lacking in the culture right now and the question is what is a man what is a man because the right gets this wrong sometimes to you it is true that the left is all these soy boys as they are called but the the the right sometimes has this obsession in dark corners of the internet with alpha males and beta males and bah blah I know I'm gonna kill dragon Baba right but that isn't manliness either you find manliness in the virtues for that's where the word virtue comes from its from vir vir which is which is man in Latin virtue there is a virtue in acting like a man Harvey Mansfield wrote that good book on it manliness and he says that you know manliness has a sort of brutal force to it but it also has a refinement into politeness so he gives the example sometimes the it's manly to hold the door for a woman and allow her to enter before you go in and then sometimes it's manly to push her out of the way and say get out of my way I've got to stop the bad guy right both of those things are manly and they seem they seem different but they they're part and parcel manliness is not nice Jimmy Fallon is nice that's why Donald Trump tells him he's got to act like a man manliness is not nice niceness is pleasantness to be nice as like over the oh he's such a nice guy's Pleasant he's agreeable being nicest being agreeable you know Alan Blum who wrote the closing of the American mind in the 1980s he indicted but all of the American students that he knew by saying that they were nice the nicest thing the best thing you can say about these students is that they were nice and we meant as their shallow they don't stand for anything they don't have any core beliefs they're uncultured they're uneducated they're not they're just that they're just nice and you know manliness is not nice it just isn't nice to be agreeable go along to get along be timid be a pushover that is not the same as being manly and Donald Trump is not nice our government right now is not nice it isn't doing nice things that doesn't mean it's uncivil you know manliness right now is paying dividends for our government and we're seeing it every day more and more each each day we see this manliness right now an unknown is respecting restoring civil government it's restoring civility to our government just look on foreign policy it came out today that the Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif is saying that ripping up the Iran nuclear deal could topple the Iranian regime now you've probably heard the name of javad zarif before he is John Kerry's boyfriend he was the guy you know like late at night on Saturday nights John Kerry picks up the phone once Teresa's gone to bed hello Javy Javy are you there Javy I'm just oh I miss you Javy I miss you I'm thinking of died miss you're through yeah I just I've been thinking about you a lot you don't call anymore Joe right I mean it and a half exaggerating here but he actually does still call this guy which is a whole separate issue that the former Secretary of State is undercutting u.s. foreign policy here by dealing directly with the foreign minister of Iran when that foreign minister is saying the current US policy that Donald Trump is pursuing the aggressive muscular masculine foreign policy is possibly gonna topple our regime and we're there's a lot of evidence that isn't just bluff from the foreign minister the Iranian rial the Iranian currency has just plunged to a record low against the US dollar there's a major Indian energy company it just cut its Iranian or oil imports by half Russia's second biggest oil producer has was going to start building projects in Iran it is halted all development there so there are actually real serious warning signs here and by the way all of the people who are these big Trump critics I think of some of the neoconservative types at some of the magazines you know they're they they're the ones pushing for regime change in Iran but they weren't able to affect it the Obama administration wasn't able to affect it obviously the Bush administration didn't pursue regime change in Iran it looks like Donald Trump is actually the one who's going to do it their protests pouring out into the streets right now we were told oh no if you rip up the Iranian nuclear deal you're going to embolden the regime in Iran it's ago they're gonna be emboldened by this was keeping them at bay well no that isn't what's happening a little muscle goes a long way Donald took out that ad in the New York Times in 1988 I think it was at the end of the Reagan era and he said there's nothing about us national policy that a little backbone can't cure we're actually seeing this that play out and it isn't nice but it is helpful that strong foreign policy has gotten North Korea to the table right gotten that crazy dictator with nuclear weapons to come to the table and possibly we can find to come to some sort of nuclear arrangement who knows we're in again we're in inning one or two of that but it got them to the table previous administrations were not able to do that how about on domestic policy that's that's the least and nice isn't it that's the area where Donald Trump you know is ripping babies from their mother's arms never mind that all the pictures that we've been shown aren't actually separated children never mind that they can't point to examples of that never mind that Barack Obama did the same thing actually on a much larger and worse scale never mind any of that they're saying it's so not nice it's mean it's inhuman Tom Arnold was in this room yelling at me and saying it's not human it's it's it's not nice it's mean it's blah blah blah so we cut to a poll right now from CBS mainstream media about half of Americans say that we need to send illegal families back 48% of Americans we catch them at the border we have to send them back that is just this is a recent poll that's despite the mainstream media spending 176 minutes during six days covering the poor little children in this very emotional coverage mainstream media spent six and a half minutes covering Barack Obama when he did exactly the same thing on a larger scale that means that I'm no math expert that means that the mainstream media spent 27 times more coverage on Donald Trump all of these emotional segments nevertheless about half of Americans they send them back because that's what we want it is maybe that's not nice maybe it would be more agreeable if we just rolled over and we're pleasant it so come into the country anyone who wants to come in come on in bro you want to bring drugs that's bring it it's okay I'm not gonna stop you cuz I'm a nice guy I'm a nice guy so why would I stay okthat's oh you want a traffic inhuman little babies and you want to have little kids come over and force them to work on farms oh that's okay I'm not gonna stop you I'm really agreeable oh that's what you want to sexually assault women at the border at a rate of 60 to 80 percent well I'm not going to because I'm such a nice guy no this is not a nice policy this is a civil policy this is a manly policy this is a law and order policy but that's what we need that's what we need right now and then America agrees with that do you know that right now half of Americans say that we need to build the wall half of Americans that that number would have been unthinkable even two or three years ago but we were now seeing when the rubber meets the road and you get rid of all of the sort of pleasantries and the shallow niceness what the issue is where the conflict really lies and Americans want to protect their border because we're a nation of laws we're not a nation of men that's not what we're supposed to be you know that it isn't nice but President Trump has put the mainstream media in their place this is the distinction manliness is not nice but it is civil civil it it means relating to citizens it comes from the Latin words she beliefs or key beliefs which is you know relating to the city relating to people who live within the city I noticed this distinction a left-wing reporter emailed me before this and asked me if it's not hypocritical they're Republicans now are saying people need to be civil even though in the past Newt Gingrich used to say you know they should be Republicans are too nice right so isn't that hypocritical no the right is not nice but it is civil the left is not civil but it is nice look at the Sarah Sanders situation so press secretary or Sarah Sanders was kicked out of a restaurant in Lexington Virginia called Red Hen I mentioned the restaurant so that you never ever go there obviously right I mean that's they she kicked her at the owner there was Stephanie wilkinson and here's how the event went down because I don't know if this parts totally been covered so Sarah Sanders goes in with some friends sits down at a table they start eating the staff at this restaurant calls up the owner Stephanie wilkinson calls her up at home and says the press Secretary's here what should we do and Sarah Stephanie Wilkinson said I'm gonna come down there and kick her out so she goes down she's sick she marches up to Sarah Sanders and she says you need to leave I don't want to serve you at my establishment so I want you to leave and what does Sarah Sanders do she leaves a for reaction we cut now Andrew Garfield what do you think about that we are sacred and we all belong so let's just bake a cake for everyone who wants a cake to be baked oh that's that's sort of surprising from the left there sit so she should have just served Sarah Sanders I guess right did Sarah Sanders order cake I don't know if she ordered cake maybe if she ordered cake or flowers then the left would demand that Sarah Sanders be served but maybe I don't know maybe was roasted chicken or something so a little bit look at that that's though I mean it is really incredible that on the left right now they say we need to serve everybody how dare you kick someone out just because you don't want to participate in his gay marriage ceremony how dare that's wrong that's terrible but if you don't if I don't like somebody I'm not gonna serve them it is Andrew being Sybil here no when he says bake a cake for everybody no that's just nice wouldn't it be nice if we just baked cakes for everybody but it's not civil because it actually undercuts how citizens relate to each other in a free republic by the way the Sarah Sanders story doesn't end there according to Mike Huckabee the owner of the Red Hen nobody has really talked about this yet followed the rest of the people across the street so Sarah Sanders and her husband go home the rest of their dinner party goes across the street she follows them across the street calls up other people organizes a protest to yell and scream at them from outside the other restaurant and create this scene definitely not civil civility is not nice it's not glib it's not charming it's not weak it's not timid it's not it's not all those things that we think it's civility means you can say hard things nice nice people can't say hard things civil people can say are things it's just a formal manner of behavior it's to say be an adult act like a man don't be like a little boy little children yell and scream and they do and that's why we don't let little children govern us the left ones to lower the voting age at this point I think two like seven but wait I checked my watch for that but you know they want to lower but when you you have to grow up and behave as though you're worthy of the freedom that we have in a republic as though you're worthy to be a citizen unfortunately we don't have that to to just put put a little button on it let's turn to the emblem of the left these days crazy ol Maxine Waters we're gonna end it no you're not you ain't seen nothing yet we have to protect the children we have to protect the children you can't do anything unless you want to kill them in the womb and then you can then do that but didn't definitely do that don't protect the children but but and but then that's actually that makes you a good person but otherwise you have to protect the children so of course of course I don't even know if she understands this I don't know if Maxine Waters understands very much but this is not going to turn out well what she is proposing is mob violence that's what she's asking for she says when you see somebody that you disagree with it you know like you surround them you physically intimidate them you scream at them you go to their place of residence and you keep them awake at night and you don't let them sleep and you drive them crazy so that bad things happen to them to their body to their lives to their families go and she's saying go to their house she's saying terrorize their families that's what that means go keep them because by the way if you if you have a screaming mob outside someone's house it doesn't just mean that they stay awake and their kids sleep soundly at night that's not how that works the kid it's just terrorized people that you disagree with this is this is civility from Maxine Waters right and and of course listen now she says if she goes they don't know the Bible Reverend Maxine father maxi bishop Maxine is telling us about the Bible right they don't know that but we know that God's on our side it's on our side right the irony of this of course it is a total misunderstanding of what civil society is what government is because guess what Maxine Maxine can criticize her opponents of things she might not understand what she's criticizing for exactly and we can criticize Maxine for things and then if our solution to that is to terrorize one another then we don't have a government we don't have a country we don't have a society anymore you can't communicate if what she what they are saying what the left is saying Maxine Waters as their mouthpiece saying stop communicating stop trying to get along and live together stop trying to deal seriously with issues but you know in a formal manner of politeness that allows us all to live in relative peace and harmony she's saying forget all that burn it all to the ground that's that's what they want you know how does one respond to this well the right should still be civil the right should still be manly you know I mean because that those two things civility and manliness it says everything about the person who's doing it it doesn't say anything about the opponent they're all kind of crazy Maxine Waters running around and that doesn't mean that we should get in the muck and start terrorizing her does it no we should we should say hard things we should we don't have to be nice about it but you don't want to get just you don't want to start keeping Maxine Waters his family up at night right Maxine she's always been like this by the way she loves violence during the LA riots in the early 90s she loved that she said oh this is what a wonderful thing how great oh this is such a pivotal moment and we're burning down all of LA that's great isn't that wonderful you know the sort of stuff that she's advocating we're seeing it all over the place already in Florida the Attorney General Pam Bondi I just came out she said three huge guys came up were screaming at her cursing at her one inch from her face then one guys spit on her head that's the world that Maxine Waters wants that's what she wants but it's okay because Donald Trump said a naughty word ten years ago that's okay Donald Trump is enforcing immigration law immigration law that Barack Obama also partially enforced immigration law that was passed 10 years ago more than that and parts of which were decided 20 years ago a keith ellison deputy chairman of the of the democrat party is now saying he's posing in photos with people who say the US has stolen land that's that's what they say they're undercutting the fabric of the united states itself and maybe the left is gonna tune in to my show if you know anybody on the Left tell them to tune in right now because they don't because I'm gonna give them important advice they they don't know what civil means they don't know what civility is you know they don't understand these semantic distinctions I did that Praeger video on why words matter on how these semantic distinctions actually matter a lot we don't teach civics in school and so it's no surprise that these people don't know what it means civics requires good faith it requires you to be an adult it requires virtue it requires the virtues all of our founding fathers talked about this they said you know this this free republic is only fit for a moral under religious people for an upright people for people who educates itself for people who works hard for people who isn't vicious who don't have who don't have all the vices who are you know who possess virtues and this isn't virtuous this isn't manly this isn't grown-up this is an adult they're acting like little children they're uneducated uncultured they just scream naughty words and they spout moral idiocy if they're behaving like little children but you got it people you've got if you're gonna try to preserve the country you got to act like a man you got to do what real Donald Trump said to Jimmy Fallon don't act like a little boy don't act like a little kid you got to grow up now speaking of children we're gonna talk about this kids movie which which gender politics and not being a man and all that sort of stuff has also destroyed before we get to it I gotta say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube I'm sorry I got so much to talk about on the incredibles I'm catching a little a lot of heat

we have to be a nation of laws and let people who have been waiting in line come in first and we can't just give him the spirit of mmm the majority of Americans approve of Donald Trump's handling of

know I was talking before about manliness as a kind of the difference between being a little child and being a grown man now I'm gonna talk about manliness as the opposite of feminism there's a subtle distinction here because feminism ruins everything it ruins everything it even managed to ruin the Incredibles I have kind of a fresh face on this you know I don't like superhero movies I don't ever see little kids movies I just don't go to them I only want to see like foreign films in like Lichtenstein II and with subtitles that I can wear a beret to and smoke cigarettes during in the theater I well you know I really like those kind of more pretentious movies but but this one a sweet little elisa saint little elisa saint little michael mrs. Knowles she wanted to go see Incredibles too and so I said alright I'll go see Incredibles too but I've never seen Incredibles one so I actually think I have a pretty good perspective on this because I watched the two movies back to back I watched just I went straight from Incredibles the original int and headed to the movie theater and saw the sequel the first movie is one of the best movies of the last 20 years if you haven't seen it go out and see it it is so good and the reason why it's so good it's it's about superheroes I guess but it's really not about superheroes I mean it is it is it's good in that genre but it's so much more than that and when movies are so much more than those genres I tend to like them like Logan the movie Logan is it I guess it's a superhero movie but it's so much more than that so I've really liked that movie or the Dark Knight even is a superhero movie and it and it is more than just a superhero movie it does have some some weight to it so I go into this with The Incredibles and Incredibles is about this family led by mr. incredible he's the husband and there's a last a girl as the wife and three kids but it's a movie about something it's a movie about a midlife crisis all of the other superhero movies are just basically popcorn movies where they all follow the exact same formula there aren't even spoilers that you can give to them because we all know exactly how those movies play out this movie isn't like that it's a movie about a midlife crisis it's a movie about a guy whose glory days were in the past when was a superhero fighting uh you know bad guys on his own he makes a point all the time he says I work alone I work alone they're telling you something it's because he's single because he's a bachelor because he's doesn't have kids and a job and a car into this and he's just got all of his adventures there and then he trades all of that in for a wife a stay-at-home wife and three kids and car and a desk job in the suburbs he trades all that in and he's kind of miserable about it you know and he's guys there's some drudgery to it so what does he start doing he starts doing things that guy's going through midlife crisis do he starts lying to his wife he starts staying at a little late with his friend and just try to try to relive the good old days and his friend is like what are we doing man come on right he buys a sports car and he starts going on his clandestine rendezvous with a beautiful young woman all without telling his wife and when when his selfishness when his recklessness finally gets him into trouble what happens it's his wife who comes and tries to find him because she's jealous she's nervous she you know his selfishness is about to ruin his family and she catches him in the arms of another woman now of course there because it's a kids movie they work around this in certain ways but that's the basic structure of even this movie is so good even the bad guy is his name is syndrome and it's a pun it's a pun on sin because this it's a movie about his own mr. Incredibles own original sin of pride his own selfish pride the bad guy in that movie if you haven't seen it I don't care about spoilers because this came out 14 years ago the bad guy was his biggest fan as a little kid he called himself incrediboy and you know you've really liked him he's just he's a manifestation of mr. Incredibles own selfish ego it's that syndrome right as s:y an or maybe s IM and the the you know the syndrome character he is just a mere mortal but he wants to be like a superhero which is to say make himself like a god so he creates all this technology to try to do it right and the only way that things come right in the end is when mr. incredible realizes that looking to the Past and is his old glory days as a bachelor is looking to them as the good old days you that's totally backwards he says to his kids he says and he says to his wife you're my greatest adventure my greatest adventure lies ahead of me because I'm moving forward in my life I'm not stuck in the past well you know and needing to drive a sports car to try to pick up chicks you worm and so they come together as a family and then they defeat the bad guy and as if this weren't clear enough that the these two old characters at the end Frank and Ollie one says he goes he goes oh that's old school they did it the old school way the other guy says there's no school like the old school right that's the like oh yes he did the traditional thing and that worked that saved the day even you know the way they beat the bad guy is they do things that families do they argue over a remote they the father throws a pass like a football pass to his son right it's so beautiful it's a really good movie I mention that because this new movie is so much worse it's so bad it's like if the second movie is an apology for the first movie the second movie begins there will be some spoilers later not quite yet the second movie begins exactly where the first movie left off so it's not like there's a huge time delay here and then it basically just undoes the first movie everything in the first movie it just says now never mind I'm sorry we shouldn't have said that so something you probably have already heard probably from the trailer is that this movie is much more focused on the wife on Elastigirl so here comes some spoilers she's got all the action sequences she's gonna you know she's gonna go she's gonna do the job she's gonna fight the bad guys and her her husband is gonna be stuck at home with the kids which he obviously screws up because what an idiot husbands are right I mean wives are just so much more confident than their husbands like can he even can even work a microwave ha ha ha right and look this is the oldest joke in in cheap humor right this is every sitcom every TV commercial for the past 30 years it's been about how the wife does everything great she's perfect she's the genius she's brilliant she's totally competent and the husband that guy can barely put his shoes on what a dummy what how does that guy how did he make it out of like his house is a kid I mean I use so without getting hit by a bus or something that that's what they set up here they the the movie can never give the wife any character flaws if she has to do everything perfectly and she did and and mr. incredibly is just sort of tangential but another reason again some more spoilers here why this is under it undercuts the first movie is it in the first movie it's mr. incredible who looks at his old days doing all the adventures with the bad guys and stuff and the wife says no you're a family man now get a job live in the suburbs raise your family be a good guy she doesn't want to go off and fight bad guys she doesn't want to go off on her own and have independent adventure and then in the second movie which begins exactly where the first movie lets off all of a sudden she said never mind no I want to go fight bad guys on my own again oh no that'll be fun oh that was so fun when I fought that bad guy on my own it's just this feminist undercutting of the whole thing and now some people are saying major spoiler here so close your ears for 20 seconds if you don't want to hear it that the the villain in this movie is a feminist she's like a sort of it's a embodiment of feminism right okay villainous things are villainous so that's true I mean that that is how that plays out in movies but it doesn't make up for it it doesn't make up for what the whole movie is saying at the end it's just it just becomes this popcorn movie I'm not saying that Incredibles 2 is a feminist screed you know and it's awful and it's ruining society it's just like men it's just if I had just seen Incredibles 2 and not seeing the original right beforehand I would say okay well I probably won't even talk about it I'd say well that was whatever compared to all the other stuff coming out of Hollywood whatever but because it's it's an answer to the first I think it's a real missed opportunity it took them 14 years to turn a wonderful life into an episode of Everybody Loves Raymond I mean it is so so frustrating so let me know what you think I know people have been tweeting me about this for two days since I put my review out so let me know what you think I'm happy to hear more about it but I have to tell you I'm completely right so that's the show today tune in again tomorrow we have some pretty crazy guests coming up I don't want to ruin it though and tell you all about it in
