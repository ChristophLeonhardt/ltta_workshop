GREGG DAVID WILL BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND HOMELESSNESS CRIPPLING CALIFORNIA. FIRST LIT'S GET TO THE BIG STORY. YOU WOULDN'T KNOW FROM THE REST OF THE MEDIA. JOBS, ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND INCOME EFFECT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND IT'S WHAT THE POPULOUS REVOLUTION IS ABOUT. THESE ARE OTHER NUMBERS I HAVEN'T SEEN COVERED. 5.4%. THAT'S THE LOWEST YOU THAT'S THE LOWEST UOU THAT'S THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR WORKERS WITH A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. ALSO .5% IS THE RISE IN EARNINGS FOR COLLEGE GRADUATES. THAT'S CLEAR EVIDENCE THE TRUMP ECONOMY IS HELPING THE PEOPLE THE PRESIDENT PROMISED TO HELP. THOSE LEFT BEHIND BY DECADES. JOINING ME NOW, THE HOST FROM FOX BUSINESS NETWORK KENNEDY IS HERE. SO NICE TO SEE YOU IN BEAUTIFUL LAS ANGELES. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THEY WOULD BACK TRUMP BECAUSE OF THIS BIG ISSUE OF THE ECONOMY. AT LEAST HE WILL GET THE ECONOMY MOVING. IT FEELS LIKE THAT IS HAPPENING. THERE IS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WASHINGTON SEES THE ECONOMY AND FAMILIES SEE THE ECONOMY. POPULISM DOESN'T MEAN STATISM OR GROUP THINK. IT'S ABOUT INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THAT LOOKED AT THE LANDSCAPE. THEY HAVE ASKED FOR YEARS WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME. YOU TALK ABOUT A WIN FALL ON WALL STREET. FOR SOME THAT'S GREAT. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS I DON'T STOP THEIR WEALTH. THAT'S REALLY GREAT. THOSE METRICS DON'T NECESSARILY APPLY TO THEM. WHAT THEY WANT IS SOMEONE WHO THINKS IN AN UNORTHODOX WAY THAT WILL SHAKE THINGS UP AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE THAT HAVE BEEN ABUSING THEIR POWER AND FORGETTING ABOUT THEM. IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WHEN YOU HERE HILLARY CLINTON AND PRESIDENT OBAMA AND BEN RHODES TALK ABOUT THE FAILURE OF THE 2016 ELECTION. IT WAS THEIR FAILURE TO LOOK AT THE PROBLEMS THESE PEOPLE WERE HAVING. YOU MENTIONED BEN RHODES. HE HAS THIS QUOTE IN IT. HE SPOKE ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE JUST SAYING. WHY THEY LOST AND OBAMA WONDERED WHY THE REASON HE WAS REJECTED WAS TO DO WITH RACE. HE SAID I WAS 10 OR 20TY YEARS 1 HE SAID I WAS 10 OR 20TY YEARS 0 HE SAID I WAS 10 OR 20TY YEARS O HE SAID I WAS 10 OR 20TY YEARS HE SAID I WAS 10 OR 20TY YEARS 0 HE SAID I WAS 10 OR 20TY YEARS Y HE SAID I WAS 10 OR 20TY YEARS A HE SAID I WAS 10 OR 20TY YEARS S LATER. THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION LEFT SO MANY PEOPLE BEHIND. THE ECONOMY WASN'T WORKING FOR WORKING PEOPLE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE SIMILARITIES YOU HAVE TWO BIG SPENDING PRESIDENTS THAT FELT THEY COULD JUST APPLY THEIR WORLD VIEW AND MAKE PEOPLES LIVES BETTER WHETHER IT WAS STANDARDING WARS IN STANDARDING WAR -IN STANDARDING WAR N STANDARDING WAR STARTING WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST OR HAVING MASSIVE SPENDING PROGRAMS. THAT MADE PEOPLES LIVES WORSE. IT MADE IT HARDER TO START A BUSINESS AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE DROPOUT OF THE WORK FORCE ENTIRELY. YOU HAD EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS GOING UP. YOU HAD A HUGE PART OF THE LABOR FORCE THAT WASN'T PARTICIPATING AT ALL. THAT'S WHAT IS CHANGING NOW. THEY TALK ABOUT THE 1%. THE PEOPLE REALLY BEN BE THE PEOPLE REALLY BENEFE THE PEOPLE REALLY BENEFITING RIGHT NOW WERE IN THE WORK FORCE. LOOKING AHEAD, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE IMPACT WILL BE OF THE TRADE STRATEGY. IT DEPENDS ON THE LONG-TERM GOAL. BOTH SIDES ARE EXCITED. THEY KNOW ECONOMIC PROTECTIONISM DOESN'T WORK. IF HE USES IT AS A SHORT-TERM STRATEGY. IF THIS IS A NEGOTIATION TOOL TO RECRAFT NAFTA AND HAVE MORE TRADE WITH THE E.U., CANADA, AND MEXICO. IF IT'S SHORT-TERM AND WORKS OUT AND LEADS TO MORE U.S. ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT'S GOOD. IF IT'S A LONG TERM STRATEGY. THAT WILL BE PROBLEMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. IT COULD BE A PROTRACTED TRADE WAR. THINGS LIKE STEEL AND ALUMINUM GO TO MAKING OTHER THINGS. IF THEY ARE MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE OF TARIFFS THAT WILL BE A BIG ISSUE WITH INFLATION ALSO ON THE RISE. I REALLY AGREE WITH THAT ANALYSIS. WE SHOULD BELIEVE WHAT HE SAYS. HE SAID I'M FOR FREE TRADE AND FAIR TRADE. IT'S THE BEGINNING OF A NEGOTIATION. I WANT TO SWITCH TO ONE MORE TOPIC. THIS REALLY GOT ME RILED UP. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT HE SAID ON THURSDAY OR FRIDAY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. MR. TRUMP WILL PROMOTE HIS NARRATIVE. HE WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO DISCREDIT THE FBI AND CIA AND OTHERS. I THINK, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, THE AMERICAN JUSTICE SYSTEM WILL PREVAIL IN THIS ENDEAVOR ABOUT WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN COLLABORATING AND WORKING WITH FOREIGN ACTORS. COLLABORATING AND WORKING WITH FOREIGN ACTORS. IT WAS YOU, JOHN, THAT GOT INVOLVED WITH THE DOSSIER. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE ARROGANCE OF THE PEOPLE. THE FBI EMPLOYED CHRISTOPHER STEEL FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME. I THINK JOHN LIKE JAMES COMBY ARE SAVIORS OF THE GILLED INSTITUTION. IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. WHAT HE'S DOING. ALL IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE DOING IS TRYING TO SHIELD THEMSELVES FROM ANY ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT TONIGHT. YES, THE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO ARE DEFENDERS OF THE PRESIDENT. I THINK HIS ATTACKS ARE SMALL MINDED. THEY ARE INCREDIBLY SHORTSIGHTED. THEY IMPROVE THE PRECEPTIAL OF THE COMMUNITY. IF THAT'S WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO HE NEEDS TO COME UP WITH A BETTER STRATEGY. HE HATES THE PRESIDENT AND OPPOSED TO WINNING POLITICALLY. HE'S DOING WHAT HE CAN TO HARM THE PRESIDENT IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE. I TOTALLY AGREE. THEY JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
