Donald Trump could end a program that has already granted work permits to hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who originally came to this country as children as early as originally reported today now they're saying perhaps over the weekend perhaps by Monday maybe they try to squeak it in when the news isn't watching as closely and it's already received a lot of opposition of some of the people opposing this move ending daca are the normal sorts of people that you would expect but there's also some voices that you might not and we're gonna go over some of those on today's show first here is Speaker Paul Ryan the president might be looking at pulling back doctor the dreamers act yeah I mean I actually don't think you should do that and I believe that this is something that Congress has to fix let me back up for a second President Obama did not have the legislative authority to do what he did but you can as an executive write law out of thin air and so that's very very clear we've made that very clear having said all of that there are people who are in limbo these are kids who know no other country who were brought here by their parents and and don't know another home and so I really do believe that there needs to be a legislative solution that's one that we're working on and I think we want to give people peace of mind in and so I've had plenty of conversations with the White House about this issue so uh obviously they have clashed on a couple of issues this looks like it's gonna be another one and he was talking there about the the people who he said in his words have never known another country and it's not a small group already nearly 800,000 have received work permits and deference from deportation and remember this program was only originally set up under President Obama it hasn't been around for decades and decades and so imagine how many people could help if Trump doesn't kill it this weekend right so look to be clear on a couple things so first of all in the substance of it yeah you had to be brought into a country when you were under 16 years old you have to be a quote/unquote productive member of society meaning there's specific definitions you have to have a job actually five percent of them have created their own jobs and our entrepreneurs and and the list goes on and you have to finish high school and then either go to college and listen the military some of them have purchased homes in the United States so these are people who came here when they were incredibly young they in a lot of cases came here when they were children and their parents smuggled them into the country and so this is the only country they've ever known and they've built their lives here and so the fact that Trump is considering just deporting them or ending this program under Obama is devastating not just for the individuals who will suffer from this deportation but also the US economy which is something that I think Trump supporters refuse to even acknowledge yeah yeah to Anna's point I believe sixteen percent of them either 12 or 16 percent have have homes have bought homes I just pictured like when I read that passage all these empty homes ghost homes well where are the people who bought them well they were deported based on something that has decades ago and keep in mind these are people who did not have access to government programs that Americans do right so in the vast majority of cases they didn't qualify for federal student loans they didn't qualify for government assistance despite what Republicans will tell you now certain states might have certain laws that do offer some help but the vast majority of these individuals built lives without any government assistance whatsoever these are to say their productive members of society doesn't go far enough right they were able to overcome certain obstacles that American citizens can't even overcome or don't have to overcome and to treat them as if there's some you know criminal group of people that don't deserve to be here is just disgusting and lacks compassion yeah I'm sorry on the issue of the of the mechanics of this Paul Ryan brought up executive orders so look I think there's an interesting case to be made there so Obama his position was the executive branch gets to enforce the law so I am NOT going to enforce the law against these people who were brought into their country not against their will that's too strong but having no volition in that even have legally consent yeah they couldn't consent they could not consent they were brought in by their parents as kids they they did not take any action as an adult so they're not like illegals as people put them and etc in order to do that you'd be an adult it said so he's saying I'm not enforcing that part of it I got some issues with that but the guy who or he's putting a far lower level of priority effectively zero priority that's right but you can't choose if I mean you only have so many resources like maybe we'll get to some later okay but let's be consistent here both us and the Trump supporters like all right so Trump then says well I I'm gonna sign executive orders and I'm going to say for example ok I'm not allowing Muslims in those sorry certain Muslims into the country well I mean did you pass a law barring Muslims from those countries who are not in pass a law I just did an executive order Trump passed a law banning transgender military members no he just decided randomly when he realized that there were no legislative wins under his administration that he was gonna pander to his base and send out early morning tweets about banning transgender people right yet even can't even talk to the Defense Department about that so this whole notion of like oh I didn't like what Obama did with you know this executive action please spare me the tears the reason why that happened was because members of Congress keep using the issue of immigration during their campaigns pretending as though they want to do something they want to be leaders they want to be tough but when it came to the issue of dreamers they didn't want to do anything there was absolutely no progress and so what are these kids gonna do what are these people gonna do they're worried they don't know how they're supposed to pursue their lives or their careers Obama take some leadership and he took some action I'm totally fine with that well look I just want to be clear to finish my point so these exam orders are tough because yes it does fall within the parameters of the executive branch they enforce the law but it can be abused and you can go too far and where you draw the line on these is not an easy issue and it's not a black-and-white issue but but we've got to be trying to be consistent on in either way and so these guys that's claim that they hate Obama's example love Trump's executive orders and so Paul Ryan luckily you're in a great position to do something you the Speaker of the House you can pass a law to Anna's point you should and everybody agrees Democrats and Republicans agree you should pass an actual law so get to work yeah and you can go back to any number of vague quotes from Donald Trump from the primary or the general election where he said he was going to treat this group of people with heart I'm sure he thought that was a policy statement it wasn't it was vague and he's gonna turn on on his previous words he batters that sorry John it because there was an update right before we came on the show you don't have to go back to the campaign for Trump absurd quotes about dreamers it he was asked about it today because this action is imminent and he said it might happen today it might happen over the weekend the White House earlier it said put out a statement saying it'll happen on Tuesday it might happen on Tuesday so Trump of course preempt him they anyway but when a reporter asked him about it he said Oh quote we love the dreamers we love everybody what does that mean how can you love the dreamers and they deport them out of the country it means that 8:00 p.m. tonight because it's Friday night and every Friday night he thinks about you know a new group of people that he wants to destroy he will go ahead and and the daca program I guarantee it Friday night that's what always happens yeah and I mean when you think about 800,000 people like as an appointed out the immediate economic impact and you could look at any number of different impacts of suddenly plucking a significant portion of the entire US population out and then throwing them overseas to a country that they know nothing about have no support structure and don't own a home don't have a job have no legal paperwork there either so that's a terrible idea but then think about the ripple effects from it that's potentially hundreds of thousands of spouses and children friendships clients and businesses you know they might be in schools at this point friendships that are disrupted organizations political or otherwise I mean the ripple effects are massive they're impossible to overstate and keep in mind okay and I'm gonna repeat this every time the issue of immigration comes up during the Trump administration keep in mind that while he threatens to deport these people who built their lives here in the United States he had applied to in race the cap of foreign workers coming into the country just so Trump industries can hire more foreign workers the day after he did that executive action Trump Industries applied for more foreign workers okay so this is disgusting to say the least I just want to show you two more the people are criticizing him it's not just Ryan first of all if we could jump ahead senator Orrin Hatch said I've urged the president not to rescind an action that would have further complicate a system in serious need of a permanent legislative solution he says that Congress should be that solution well I mean you got a senator you got Paul Ryan probably a rally up a couple of others if you want to actually do something about it but we also have not just politicians but pundits so as Jared Jackson pointed out in our morning production meeting it's apparently that time of the year where Geraldo is accidentally right about something and slightly naive and kind of ridiculous reasons but here is his advice for Donald Trump I just want to say this and I want to be crystal clear and unmistakable in my message to Donald Trump you you cannot do this you cannot make true the false stereotype that you are cruel and uncaring you must do the right thing these are the most vetted immigrants we have ever had we know their background they've been fingerprinted they they have to be crime free they have to either be a gainful employment allah j a many of them most of them have citizen siblings if if we were now to unleash the power of the federal government to root out eight hundred thousand of these DREAM Act students it would permanently tarnish the reputation and legacy of President Trump and it will affect of how I feel about oh my god it will affect the way or all the things about is like a feels about a little so look that sounds so ridiculous to ninety-nine point nine percent of Americans right however keep in mind that the one person who cares about what people think about him the most is Donald Trump and he is watching that and he's watching that and so he look Geraldo actually use what I believe a pretty smart tactic he's not trying to make any economic arguments he's not trying to talk about anything that's nuanced or smart he's just saying don't do this because people are really gonna dislike you and it's gonna ruin your legacy Ryan talk about it like you're talking to a child by shaming a child that's the only way who's gonna process it it's I don't know if he doesn't the problem is I don't think it really cares ofor all the things about it could get like dying oh there's a hey might so it was you look at first I read the quota for all those about how it will put make true the false statements about how you are cruel and I thought oh my god Geraldo is dumber than I thought and then I realized no no actually like you guys are saying it's it's he knows that that Trump is likely watching Fox News and it's actually somewhat of a savvy strategy to say now mr. president you are wonderful and everybody knows how great you are but don't let those false statements about dividing you be proven true by doing this thing that I'm against yeah I just in practice it sounds a little bit silly yeah it sounds preposterous but you you're right John he's talking to a child and that you know so in a petulant angry you know thin-skinned child so that is probably an effective way to talk to and finally I mean to put this in a slightly larger context I mean we've pointed out I know Anna has cited this statistic many times over the past couple of years that while there's been for decades upon decades concern about there just there's people slidin over the border in our country is just getting full of undocumented immigrants there's always fear the fear is not necessarily based on the facts just an emotional response as we point out many times people come in and people go out you know that's the way it is lots of people come out and lots of people go back the border is porous but not just in one direction it's in both directions that's right but the fear and the hysteria over the supposed like flood of immigrants led them to tighten up the border and make it more difficult to transit one way and then back so the people who came in couldn't afford to leave again because they didn't know what would happen to them after that so instead they simply stay every time they try to tighten the border to keep people out what they do is simply make it that anybody who does come in does not go the exact opposite of what they have hoped to achieve and so we don't know what might be coming after doc is destroyed or not but you can be sure based on history it's gonna be incredibly counterproductive so I last a couple thoughts so one is that I looked up the number it's 16 percent of them have homes so that would mean well over a hundred thousand abandoned homes it reminds me of like some of these TV shows the 4400 the leftovers where people are likes like mysteriously disappear there's all these missing people yeah and be missing people ghost towns etc it's preposterous and then your property values and then finally guys if you're worried oh look this isn't racial this is just about our wages are depressed because of immigrants etc they really pull the wool over your eyes to get you to think that the most powerless person in the country the guy who just crossed the border doesn't have any power at all it's the one that is affecting your wages and setting the rules and screwing you over no it's the powerful folks in the country that set the rules and so if you want your wages increased you should there's an easy way you should get legislators who would increase your wages now look they can't make you an engineer if you're not an engineer we're not talking about that we're just saying that if you're working hard you're working 40 hours a week and you got a minimum wage job the the minimum wage has not kept up with inflation it is preposterous it's criminal what's happening with minimum wage yeah argue for the powerful to increase the minimum wage which is actually going to help your family and it's actually going to increase your wages and instead of taking your aggression out on people that don't have anything new is setting those rules yeah and while it's easiest I think and most appropriate because of the fact that they are the least powerful to map out how the government can directly impact those at the lowest end of the wage scale the government thanks to the fact that they subsidized in the state and federal level business is in a hundred different ways in terms of tax incentives and regulation all of that they do have the ability to influence wages for those who make more than the minimum wage they could make all sorts of government money contingent on continually increasing wages at all different points of the wage scale they could do that if they wanted to you know who suppresses wages think about it for a second corporations do there's one person who can raise your wages he signs you're checking shoes is not - and you can be sure his wages are going out so now the reason that I point that look at such a matter of logic right so if a corporation is going to make more money if they pay their workers less you who's more powerful the CEOs and the executives in the lobbyists that give hundred billions of dollars to the politicians to set the rules on their behalf or the guy would just cross the border who affects your wages more are you insane of course is the people who are bribing I mean donating to politicians that's why your wages are low I'm showing you this chart before they diverge in 1978 productivity and wages were going along excellent so far since then productivity American productivity has been excellent the line continues to skyrocket but your wages flatline the difference between those two lines is 12 trillion dollars it didn't go to Mexican immigrants it went to the richest people in the country wakey-wakey all of this is fear-mongering to try to get you to go in the wrong direction support independent
