and now please welcome our keynote speaker he's a best-selling author the editor in chief ad Amy wire and host of the Ben Shapiro show a round of applause for Ben Shapiro how's it going y'all love you too dude well I got to admit I don't know why any of you are here it's a really nice day outside I mean like you're in California this isn't the East Coast so you really have no excuse I have an excuse for being here I have to be here I don't know why you're here but let's talk a little bit about your rights and why they're under assault and I promise you that we're gonna do a big Q&A because frankly I'm more interested in doing Q&A than I am in hearing myself talk today I'm sorry it's a Sunday hey I'm very grumpy as you can tell but I'll talk for a little while and then we can do some Q&A and that'll be a little bit more fun and when we get to the Q&A my rule stands that I have a colleges which is that if you raise your hand and you disagree with me then you go to the front of the line which is what makes for fun so today let's start by talking about your freedoms and why they are under assault so your freedoms are under assault from motivated thinkers on every side you have a group of people who believe that because there are problems in your life or in their life that they get to assault other people's rights and they get to redistribute the products of your labor they get to invade your rights on behalf of their own and the most extreme version of this is the identity politics that has suddenly infused large portions of the left it's actually generated a sort of response politics of identity politics on behalf of the right but this basic logic suggests that because you are a member of a particular victimized group in American society other people's rights don't matter the same way that your rights matter and what this creates on part of the left is the intersectional hierarchy this idea that if you're a member of a more victimized group you have more rights by nature than people who are members of less victimized groups because we have to somehow rectify the imbalances of America's history so in the intersectionality scale for the left it goes something like this in terms of the folks who are most victimized in American society those LGBT folks and then black folks and then Hispanics and then women and then Asians and then Jews and then right here at the bottom white folks and this matters because for the left this identity politics hierarchy decides how seriously we ought to take their views if you are lower on the intersectional politics hierarchy then we don't have to take your view particularly seriously in fact you should shut up and you should you should acknowledge your privilege if you are at the upper end of that echelon and then of course you should be able to not only say whatever you want but you should also be respected for what you have to say no matter how stupid it is and if your rights are violated and you're on the bottom end to that scale well that's just because that's the way the world has to work in order to fix the problems that we've had historically in the country well to understand the current assault on individual rights that's taking place across the country we first have to understand that there are two different visions of how rights work there's the negative rights vision and there's the positive rights vision the negative rights vision suggests that rights come from God you as an individual human being have rights that you would have in a state of nature without a government presence without any sort of overarching power you would have these rights you have the right to defend yourself you have the right to your own property you have the rights of freedom of speech you have the right to bear arms all of these things exist in a state of nature because they allow you to protect yourselves and own what it is that you do these are rights that come as a manifestation of you being an individual of worth of you being made in God's image then there's the positive rights view of how rights work and this is the idea that rights come from government there are no rights outside of government there's a big collective and that collective gets to tell you what your rights are and therefore if that collective decides that your rights are not as important as somebody else's rights then they can simply redistribute the rights they can circumscribe the rights that can prevent those rights from being evenly applied or available to everyone the US Constitution is based on negative rights the constitution of South Africa or the fact that the French Declaration of the Rights of Man those are based on positive rights Ruth Bader Ginsburg by the way suggests the notorious RBG she says the US Constitution is a worse Constitution than the South African Constitution because she is a devotee of positive rights this would be right to healthcare right to education right to housing now the way you can tell the difference between a negative right and a positive right just in practice is whether a right that is articulated requires somebody else's labor or time in order to effectuate so I have a right to bear arms that doesn't require anything of you I have a right to self-defense freedom of speech I have a right to my own property these require nothing of you other than you don't get to invade that right a right to housing by contrast suggest that I have to provide you housing a right to health care suggest I have to provide you health care and that if I am none willing to provide you these things then I have violated the social compact and I can be forced to at the point of gun you can see how these differences between negative and positive rights are manifest in today's politics and it's no surprise that the Constitution has come under attack from these positive rights advocates largely springing from the left now how do these positive rights intersect with the identity politics I was talking about early well the left has basically suggested that positive rights are not to be equally applied it's not that everybody has a right to housing or everybody has a right to health care it's that everybody has a right to housing and everybody has a right to health care and if we have to restrict somebody else's rights in order to guarantee that universal positive right then we will pick the groups that have historically benefited from the American system and we will penalize those groups so identity politics is really a redistributionist way of thinking about how rights are supposed to be manifest in American politics here's how all of this plays out in terms of your rights the Bill of Rights is filled with rights these are all negative rights all of the rights in the Bill of Rights with possible exception of Rights Council maybe all of these are negative rights there are rights that you have in a state of nature and that are not guaranteed to you by the government except by the government guaranteeing nobody else can invade those rights and all of those rights are currently under assault from the left that wishes to rewrite that social compact freedom of religion under the First Amendment obviously is being assaulted right now by folks who believe that rights are variable a freedom of religion suggests that I get to practice my religion as I see fit so long as I'm not harming you but what the left does is they say well your definition of harm isn't broad enough so if you run a business and you don't wish to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding you are somehow invading my rights well I'm not in any sort of negative rights world I'm obviously not invading your rights because I have no obligation to make you a cake it's my cake it's my shop I don't have a right to do you don't have a right to my cake univ rights my labor you don't have rights my time but the left has decided that freedom of religion must be quashed but specifically religions that have had historical dominance in the United States which is one of the reasons that you see all of this focus on the part of social activists on the Left focusing in on religious Christians and almost none focusing on religious Muslims for example if you go to a religious Muslim bakery they also will probably tell you that they are not interested in baking a cake for your same-sex wedding but you haven't seen any talk about that specifically because Muslims in the United States rank higher on the intersectional scale than Christians do well the same thing holds true when it comes to rights like freedom of speech and of the press the right to freedom of speech only applies under certain circumstances according to the left because some speech is harmful some speech is violence hate speech must be banned now nothing in the Constitution says any of this speech is speech violence is violence there is no such category under the Constitution or really in thought as hate speech we all know that there's such a thing as hate full speech but that's not the same thing as saying that you a subjective human being get to ban other people or use violence to stop other people from talking you can see that the left has engaged in a sort of mob politics where they grin and laugh when people's rights are shut down if I go to Berkeley then you'll see riots literal riots if I go to Berkeley because my speech is violence when I went to Berkeley requiring some 500 police officers or 600 police officers to protect the place people outside were literally chanting speeches violence which of course it is not but if the goal is to equate speech with violence then as soon as speeches violence we can shut down violence government has a role in preventing violence so if my speech is violence or causes violence then we can simply shut down my speech this is ugly stuff and you see unfortunately this this mindset becoming quite prominent across the country I'm not just talking about governmental attempts to shut down speech at this point I'm talking about an attitude of free speech that actually allows us to have a fulsome conversation about the issues you saw this manifest when it came to the me2 movement this idea that men had nothing to say about me to sit down and shut up you're men you don't know anything or abortion sit down and shut up you're men you don't know anything well we can't have a conversation if you're simply going to assume that I can't understand because of dint of birth I was born a man not my fault I mean I'll say I'm pretty happy about it but it doesn't actually mean that I can't have an opinion on matters that affect other groups more than they affect me because the entire basis of having any sort of Republic is the idea that we can talk beyond those barriers that we can have rational conversations with one another identity politics throws up a roadblock in the way of this my density politics prevents you from having these important conversations the left is assaulting the right to bear arms obviously now the right to bear arms was specifically created and meant to protect you from tyranny it wasn't meant for hunting it wasn't meant for sport shooting it was meant to protect you from tyranny and to prevent you from having your rights assaulted in your own home the left has decided however that that's not really a threat which leads to a really weird spectacle the left proclaims that President Trump is Hitler or Stalin but they want him to take all their guns which is a very weird response to Hitler or Stalin the fact is that if the left truly believed that Trump was all the things they say that he is they would be very much in favor of the right to their arms as a defense against the sort of tyranny that they specifically are afraid of but the real truth is that the attempt to take away the rights of our arms is based on the idea that your individual rights can be quashed in the name of the collective that there is a broader collective that has an interest in you not having a gun and therefore your guns should be taken away no matter how law abiding you are which is one of the weird things about gun control everybody left right and centre agrees we don't want people with severe mental illness having guns we don't want people with criminal records having guns we don't want people who are inherently dangerous having guns it's only the left that suggests we want people who are fully law-abiding to have their guns taken away from them because somehow this is going to make society safer which suggests perhaps there's an ulterior motive to the attempt to take away the right to bear arms and that is to remove obstacles between the government's control of human life and your right other elements of the Constitution that are being undermined right now other rights that are being undermined most obvious case in the last several weeks obviously is due process of law the British government violated the rights of colonists without due process of law on a regular basis now all due process of law means is that there is a fair legal system that allows adjudication of your rights and defense of those rights and due process of law requires that you be treated as an individual due process requires that your rights are yours in other words if you are an individual and you didn't do anything wrong you don't get to be thrown in jail based on what group you are a part of and yet we saw actually over the last several weeks that the left has basically decided that this is to no longer apply based on your membership in particular groups who saw this specifically with Brett Kavanaugh and due process of law the very concept of it went by the wayside the most obvious example that I saw in terms of public discourse was this grand attempt by the nation's op-ed papers to print piece after piece from women who who'd been sexually assaulted claiming that their sexual assault meant that Brett Kavanaugh was guilty Connie Chung wrote a piece like this for the Washington Post in which she talked about how as a 20 year old woman she was sexually assaulted by her doctor and she said I believe Christi and Blasi Ford because I was sexually assaulted when I was 20 well I'm curious you who are not Christian Blasi Ford was sexually assaulted by a man who is not Brent Cavanaugh and therefore Brett Kavanaugh assaulted Christine Blasi Ford this does not follow if we're going to start condemning people or removing due process of law or burden of proof or presumption of innocence simply on the basis of your identity or genetic identity it's very weird to see the same left that recognized that this was a bad thing when it came to race in the 1960s suddenly suggests that it is okay when it comes to sex in the 2010s a due process of law is the fundamental heart of our civilization removing that on the basis of identity politics is dangerous stuff obviously the most obvious example of a right being removed based on identity is the right to life and this notion that you get to simply adjudicate based on your own subjective feelings about whether you want to have a baby whether a baby is indeed a baby is just a complete violation of logic and law and common sense it makes no sense whatsoever if you want to actually make a pro-choice argument then make a pro-choice argument but that argument cannot be based on a woman has better judgment about what cons - toots life than a man and that a society that tries to protect individual human lives has no stake in what happens to the unborn that obviously is a bad argument unfortunately all of these arguments have become quite commonplace in America right now that means all of these rights are in serious danger and one of the reasons these rights are in serious danger too is because when you have a society that is focused only on rights and not at all on virtues it turns out that there's a backlash and this has been part of the problem and this is a problem for people on the right I'm not even talking about people who are not really on the right like the idiotic all right I'm not talking about folks on the right who don't actually believe in conservative principles I'm talking about the libertarian minded right folks like me there's been a problem we talk about rights all the time and that's good because we should talk about rights and how to defend them but because we very rarely talk about the virtues that are necessary to preserve freedom and preserve a free people we end up generating a backlash to the right itself so for example the right is very Pro capitalism right all of that is great I'm a I'm a virulent ly free-market individual but in order for free markets to actually operate the way they are supposed to you require a virtuous and decent people you require people who are going to abide by certain basic social rules you require people who have enough respect for each other that they're not trying to cheat each other at every turn who have enough respect for each other and the social fabric they're not trying to tear each other apart in the name of short-term gain you need a virtuous people because otherwise what happens is that bad things happen in the name of capitalism and then the left responds by saying capitalism is no good we need social control from the top you see the same thing happened with regard to freedom of speech I will defend anybody's freedom of speech including from people who disagree with me who threatened me who are who are legitimately awful human beings but if we are constantly using freedom of speech in the worst possible ways you're going to see a backlash an inevitable backlash on the part of people who have not thought about the relationship between rights and responsibilities and think that we ought to quash the right in order to make a better world that's dangerous stuff and so it's incumbent on all of us to become more virtuous in how he's weakened that's me - all right I've failed at this we all fail at this but the question is which direction are we moving can we make ourselves virtuous can we have conversations with other people without assuming the worst motives in the worst intent when it comes to the right to bear arms are we going to be responsible about how we treat our weaponry are we going to be responsible in getting trained are we going to make sure that the guns are locked up if you actually want to have good conversations while maintaining rights then what you need is a people who are committed to a certain baseline of morality due process of law means thinking beyond our confirmation bias requiring due process of law whether we like the person who is being attacked or whether we don't like the person who's being attacked we actually think through each individual case if we make ourselves better than we deserve our rights we have those rights whether we deserve them or not and the solution to misuse of Rights is not to quash the right but if we actually wish to be a free people who preserve our own rights then we have to be a more virtuous people and that's the other half of the equation every right has corresponding duties not duties on somebody else's behalf that's positive rights duties on your own behalf you have a right to free speech that means you have the obligation to think well and speak well you have the rights of property that means the you ought to treat people responsibly and make moral decisions with that property that doesn't mean we can take away your right but if you want a functioning society you need rights on the one hand and virtues on the other and if they go hand in hand then you have a functioning beautiful country that's I think what we all ought to be aiming for right left and center okay happy to take your questions and again the rule is that if you disagree and you raise your hand and go to the front of the line but I'll take it on faith that you're actually doing this not just to guess the front of the line hi Ben how's it going my name is Jesse and I wanted to ask you about spanish-language mainstream conservative media so at this point in 2018 we still have over 41 million Spanish speakers all across the United States second only to Mexico in terms of spanish-speaking population worldwide 15 million California and yet we still don't have any kind of conservative media in Spanish on any kind of mainstream or even alternative media basis there's only very you know disparate you know YouTube channels or Facebook Peters or what-have-you and when I was wondering two things one is why is this still the case second I was wondering if you and Daily wire would be interested in being able to make a shift in the culture and a shift on our country and being pioneers in this venture and was wondering if I could partner with him I grew up at the Christian missionary kentley up rune South America some of us as a group overseas dual system us in Peru I'm fully bilingual in English and Spanish and French as well because I was Miss Karen for yeah the answer your question is absolutely send us a resume conservatism is not is not limited to one language and when I spoke when I spoke at the Republican in the California Republican Party I gave the keynote address to the the California convention it's probably five years ago I actually suggested that everybody in the room want to try learning Spanish I'm working on it right now I've been working on it for years I keep failing but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be reaching out in other languages so yeah send us a resume absolutely it's beef Shapiro at Daily wire calm okay can I drop this off on the stage connected well yeah that's fine just wrap it yeah it's fine thank you okay all right hi Ben so I definitely lean to the left but I really appreciate what you do for free speech well thank you for coming I appreciate it when folks on the left Rock I listen to your show almost daily thank you so anyway so my question is since in the 1970s we've seen a polarization like steadily increase obviously right now with like Maxine Waters and like horseface it's pretty difficult to come to a more moderate politics but if it's possible to come to a more moderate politics in the next few decades how would you see that happen I mean I think that the way that this is going to happen is people are gonna get so ticks with each other then eventually they're gonna say the only way we get to live together in a society is to leave each other alone this is why I have a lot of hope for sort of the future of the libertarian movement not the party cuz the party's a joke but the movement itself I'm sorry to those of you who are members of the libertarian party you've had a naked guy prancing around with an iron cross at your convention you got nothing but what dad said I think what the left can learn from President Trump is that they don't want President Trump running their life and I think what the right has learned I knew from Barack Obama's they didn't want Barack Obama running their life which means devolution of authority to the lowest possible level that's the only way we're gonna be able to handle living in the same country with one another because if it's just a battle over who gets to control whose life then we have a real problem on our hands and so I think that you're seeing people come together around that although I think that's easier said than done in the social sphere then then the economic sphere because the left particularly is is fascinated with the idea of being able to manipulate economics from the top for a different distribution of wealth and that I think is a terrible idea I think again the only way you're gonna have a functioning society is if we leave each other alone basically thanks hi mr. Shapiro as the thing you liked you recommended that people read economics in one lesson yeah by Henry Hazlitt Yeah right that basically says that because of the broken window fallacy government spending isn't great for the economy so my question for you is is war good for the economy and if so is it good because of government defense spending and how does that impact your thoughts on whether World War two ended the Great Depression so world was so war is not good for the economy war is very bad for the economy it's a misallocation of resources toward breaking things and bombing people that could be used in their ways obviously as far as whether World War two ended the Great Depression only in terms of unemployment meaning that it was really the the return from if you take two hundred thousand people out well two hundred thousand you take millions of people out of the workforce immediately and start paying the money from future spending then there will be an immediate boost in the unemployment rate I mean a bunch of people who are unemployed now have jobs that doesn't necessarily mean the economy is getting a lot stronger in the aftermath of World War two but the rest of the world fundamentally destroyed that gave us an enormous market for us to export to basically their enormous number of countries who needed to buy our stuff and who required our stuff and that new export market combined with men returning from war and capital enthusiasm for getting back involved in the economy meant a lot also there were some deregulation that happened after World War two there was heavy regulation during World War Two itself the in fact has the leads off the beginning of his book basically by saying people think war is good for the economy war is not good for the economy it creates a short-term boost in spending which looks like it's good for the economy but it doesn't lead to any under it doesn't lead to any underlying significant growth in economic prosperity or in the creation of new products and services to make our lives better because people tend to equate unemployment rate with good economy that's not true the USSR had a 100% employment rate and a crappy economy Cuba has a 100% employment rate in a crappy economy what makes economies good is the number of goods and services that are that are life-changing powerful and widely available that make our lives better that's why your life is better now than it was in the 1970s hi you're hard man to reach - I'm glad I made it today my name is Felix I have a question for you about health care all right agree with you on this issue we spend more on per capita than any other country in the world and have some of the worst results according to the World Health Organization we were 37th in 2000 49th and 2009 and 50th in 2010 we also lead immortality' amenable to health care with over 45,000 people that will die every year because of it the top 17 countries and I have the list right here that have the best health care in the world uses some form of universal health care whether that be single-payer or too tired system or a government mandated program I am curious to know why you continue to deny that universal health care is an effective system and before you answer the question I personally would advocate for a too-tight system not single-payer okay so the answer is that it depends on what you are going for really it does so there's a couple reasons well let me put it this way here's the framework that I use when I'm thinking about health care the and sorry before that just organize my thoughts here before that the first thing to mention is that all of the countries that are doing really well on health care also we're doing well on health care before the implementation of a nationalized health care system it's not the national health care system that changed Sweden into a healthy country or Norway into a healthy country these were healthy countries before that happened that's just the way it is the United States is mainly unhealthy because we eat a bunch of shit here right okay that's it that really is the reason our diet is really different than it is in for example Japan or in Norway where people tend to exercise more and are healthier as an overall metric so comparing populations is not like it depends on where you are comparing if you compare Norwegians in the United States to people who live in Norway my guess is you probably wouldn't see an enormous difference in the level of healthcare obtained number two the United States healthcare system is a disaster area it's actually the worst of all possible worlds it is not a free market system and it's not a totally regulated system it's somewhere in between which means it's heavily regulated and heavily subsidized which leads to increased costs that's why it's so expensive when we say that we're spending an enormous amount per capita we should define who the we is the we is not the government the we is the government plus private expenditures on health care now it's my decision whether I want to spend a lot of money on end-of-life care it's my decision whether I want to spend a lot of money on immediate care so it's not quite a one-to-one ratio the way that people are making it out today and that's why in the United States for example when it comes to five-year cancer survival rates we actually ranked number one in the world that's because you actually have availability of health care if you can pay for it the question is how do you bring the cost down so now to my model of how I think about health care the Dan McLaughlin and National Review puts it this way he says you can have three things in health care you can have affordability universality and quality those are the three things that you're looking for in health care every system can guarantee no better than two so most of the systems that you're talking about if they are universal they are not affordable in the sense that the government does rack up enormous surcharges on that basis now that may not be as much as we're spending here because as I say we have the worst of all available systems we're not free market and we're not nationalized but Canada's health care system is extraordinarily expensive Britain's health care is extraordinarily expensive Norway's healthcare is extraordinarily expensive which is why the tax rates on people in the middle class and lower classes is still exorbitantly high like the United States actually has a far more progressive system of Taxation than Switzerland or Sweden or Norway right all of those countries have income taxes of 60% for folks making about 60 grand a year it's really really high there's a cost to it now the question is what are you looking for so what I am looking for is affordability and quality and not universality universal healthcare is good if you're looking for universality if you're looking for universality and affordability you don't spend a lot of money in your ration health care you see some single-payer systems that are like this if you're looking for universality and quality then you don't care that much about affordability you just spend an awful lot of money on it and if you are looking for quality and affordability then you have a free market system because that's what free markets generate they can generate near universality but not complete universality this is true for food products for example it's not true that everyone has equal access to food but food is extraordinarily cheap in the United States and very high-quality at least what you can get so the question is how do you wish to define the balance between rights and duties in a civilized society my answer is I want you know I want affordability and quality and I want social fabric picking up the rest particularly a local level and hopefully before you get to the governmental level the problem I have with the universal health care system is that it tends to drive down supply of doctors and nurses unless you spend exorbitant amounts of cash or you have to import people from other countries that work is what's happened in Britain where they're importing a lot of their healthcare system from India for example or you have to spend enormous sums of money so is there are there they're nationalized health care systems that are better than ours yeah there are Australia is better than ours Switzerland is better than ours and I agree with you if you were gonna do this you want a two-tiered system right which is more like Switzerland but in my view the best of all available systems would be a wild deregulation of the healthcare system itself leading to lowered costs higher quality and then what's left over it can be filled in with with relatively minimal investment Thanks let me - good afternoon Ben my question is on Marbury V Madison and yes you'll review would this be your primary argument against roe v wade that it was passed and it isn't in the Constitution and do you think as a follow-up to this do you think it would be a better stance for social conservatives to take a libertarian approach to say that you're against abortion for the moral reasons but that you would support it if it was passed through the states No so so the here's the so when it comes to Marbury vs. Madison in the place of judicial review I don't like judicial review as a basic element of the system I think it's quite controversial whether Marbury vs. Madison was correctly decided in the first place because I don't think that the founders meant to create a super legislature of people who are the wisest and best among us to decide what the Constitution means you know that it's still kind of hotly contested in conservative legal circles whether judicial review is a thing when it comes to abortion the chief argument I have against roe v wade on the constitutional level is nowhere in the Constitution does it say there's a right to abortion because there is no right to abortion in the in the actual Constitution of the United States in fact there's not anything even remotely approaching a right to abortion in the Constitution of the United States however when it comes to my moral and my moral stance on this I'm not libertarian on abortion in the same way that it would not be libertarian on slavery so in 1856 there was a very widespread debate in the United States between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas even though basically took the decentralized position on slavery said states should be able to decide for themselves whether or not they wish to preserve slavery or not why is it my business it's not my state it's not my life the same argument could easily be made about abortion why is it my business it's not my body it's not my life it's not my child so you know if state decides to be liberal about abortion well that's their business if you believe that human life is being violated on a fundamental level by abortion itself you cannot stand idly by and then kick it to States for a libertarian cause I'm fine with libertarianism on causes that do not involve a violation of the most basic right the right to live that is not something where I'm willing to devolve that to the lowest level the same way I'm not willing to suggest that any state that does not prosecute murder would would be allowed to do that under the Constitution the Constitution of the United States does not allow a state to simply say the murder isn't is no longer a thing or slavery is is fine I'm not going to to pretend that this is an issue on which libertarianism has anything to say in fact you can be a pro-life libertarian simply by saying that there is a fundamental rights of life that ought to be protected for those who are unborn I like the shirt the first time I see a ser press is overrated sure it will be a very great day so a lot of people especially here feel like you're just a fantastic debater destroyer of liberals and their arguments and that's not that something I've actually seen a lot in practice I've seen you a debate college students yeah so I've seen you out to bake college students but you know there are college students if you were debating 19 year old you I have no question that 19 year old you get absolutely destroyed and I see you have kind of fireside chit chats with you know Sam Harris Jordan Peterson and you're not really debating them in a substantial way either they have differences of opinions but I think you more focus on where you agree than where you disagree so my question is a if this is correct and there are some exceptions like the political debate last year why do you think this is are liberals afraid to debate you are you afraid to debate them are there a lot of examples of really great head-to-head debates that I'm just missing sure yeah I mean if you go back there that I did a series of debates in in Seattle with a group of folks when the local head of the n-double a-c-p writing for the Seattle stranger on race we did a debate with some government on experts on gun rights I mean I'm I've literally spent my entire life having my political life having conversations with folks on the left in fact those are the conversations that I enjoy the most as far as why they're all these tapes of me destroying liberals at college campuses it's because college students apparently have more courage than a lot of professional political pundits who don't actually want to get on a stage I've invited an inordinate number of folks on the left onto the Sunday special specifically because I actually prefer as opposed to the debate format the discussion format because it allows you to get a little bit deeper write debate formats themselves are built for how do you destroy the other side how do you how do you undermine a point right and that's fun I don't think it's necessarily the most productive conversation and as you see like when somebody gets up and they ask about nationalized health care I'm happy to have a conversation back and forth in a substantive way about health care looking at the different priorities and how they reflect and in fact if you actually go back and you watch all the speeches that I've made on college campuses I would say that there are many more exchanges of me talking with somebody on the left in respectful manner then there are tapes of me quote-unquote destroying anybody you know those are the ones that you like to watch because they're more fun but that doesn't mean that's what's actually happening on a daily basis afraid to debate you so my follow-up question was going to be under what circumstances would you although I'm not a famous liberal pundit ever be open to having a substantial long-form civil conversation with me I mean I'm more than happy to have one if we can both carve out the time and I'm not losing money and doing it right I mean this is this is the reality is that I only have so much time in my life and I've spent a lot of it talking with people that mean it's what my law school and college experience was about talking with folks on the Left I have friends on the Left who I speak with on a regular basis you know I don't want to name names for fear of ruining their careers but but those conversations largely do happen behind closed doors but people will have a fear of getting out in front of a camera specifically because we do live in an environment where the Rock'em Sock'em robot stuff tends to have more attention than the substantive discussion stuff hi I'm nuance bro I have a question about your position on the Iraq war cuz you have in the past you know made written articles about it and I think even today you still say that you're in support of the Iraq war so my question is well in the article that you wrote in 2005 you wrote that it's important to spread democracy and that Empire is a duty and not a choice and you said it would be good to put democracy into Iraq but when you did your Islamic radical video and you put you picked all these different populations saying how radicalized they are is it necessarily a good idea to democratize these areas and have them vote kind of like they did in the Gaza Strip and then elected Hamas no you're right I mean I think that I've bought a lot more realist on this issue no I totally like I still think the thing Iraq war didn't have to go how the Iraq war wins and I think they're pulling out precipitously from Iraq was a huge foreign policy blunder on the part of the Obama administration that if you actually wanted to form a more stable and lasting state there you had to you really did have to stay there for a longer period of time I also AM an agreement with the general hawkish foreign policy view that you can't run from the world and then expect the world to stay at your border and it's not the way that this works with that said I'm a lot less sanguine I think that I was in 2005 about the possibilities of implanted democracy in places like Iraq when there was a lot of hope about that yeah I still think that there's a possibility but it's not something that's gonna take root overnight I think there are a lot of us who are too optimistic about the possibility of that in 2005 I've been I am a fan but this is I'm in the disagree category that's fine okay there are studies which show young children find black babies dirty or not nice and that culturally black names on resumes and job applications get fewer callbacks do you think this is an example of systemic racism well I'm not gonna accuse a three-year-old of systemic racism so let's start with that I don't think that babies necessarily have the capacity to build an entire hierarchy of race like I have a four and a half year old in a two and a half year old and they can barely clean themselves and the two and a half year old can't clean himself so if he's a racist I have yet to see it manifest and he's not like burning a tiny cross in the front yard or anything as as far as you know as far as the the studies that show the the culturally black names being hired to lower Lissa rate there's actually a fascinating study that was done about last names so the question when it came to the first name study was our people being ruled out because of race are they being ruled out because of perception of culture and this makes a difference because you have what Thomas Sowell calls discrimination and then he basically has discrimination a and discrimination one a and then he has discrimination be so discrimination B is open racism you're black I'm not hiring you because I think you're inferior right that's everyone can agree is racist discrimination one right which is is basically the idea that I discriminate in my daily life between any number of choices I'm gonna discriminate today about whether I feel like having a hamburger or whether I have feel like having a cheese sandwich it doesn't have any moral content to the discrimination and then this oval talks about discrimination one a and this is where you don't have the information about the individual necessary to make a highly specific decision about that individual so instead you use the best group indicators available so for example he uses the example of criminal record President Obama in office tried to pass a regulation did pass a regulation that the federal government could not in considering on tractors could not in hiring take into account previous criminal record what this resulted in was the hiring of fewer black people because as it turns out a bunch of employers instead of looking at the individual criminal record of the person who's sitting in front of them simply said okay there's a better shot that this black guy in front of me is a criminal than the white guy in front of just by looking at the criminality rates or jail rates red have a previous criminal history rates in the two communities now is that racism or is that discrimination 1b which is operating in the absence of individual information I would say that's more discrimination one beat that's operating in the absence of individual information so will agrees that's why he uses that term now the reason that that matters with regard to the name study is because what the name study is is it's an attempt to use culture as a stand-in for race so what it is is okay if I have somebody who has a quote unquote culturally black name right which is to suggest that they maybe come from a neighborhood that is more impoverished than that maybe they may come from a a culture that is less focused on certain priorities then I'm gonna use that as the stands in for race now that may be bad instead what we would prefer is to look instead at the specifics of the resume but there's another study that was done and this sort of shows the Congress right and that was what they looked at his they looked at last names of black folks like historically black last names they looked at last names like Johnson and what they saw was that if you actually just used historically black last names there was no discrimination at all so if you put the historically black names last names on resumes and he sent them in and you put historically white last names or Jewish last names Greenstein or something on a resume they would get hired and precisely the same rates because people were actually using the name as it stands in for information they felt they did not have it wasn't that they were instead suggesting okay all black people are out so that's kind of fascinating this is not to suggest that there's no racism in American life there certainly is but we have to point to specific instances of racism gonna be very exact about where we're accusing people of racism and where we're simply accusing people of using the best information possible and if the only information that's possible that they are using is group information we have to make a better effort as a society to ensure that people can get better individualized information so they can judge on the basis of individual identity as opposed to group identity it could be discrimination but not racism right I've been my name is Neil on the student at USC and my question is do you know what smart guns are and if you do would you be in favor them as a way to reduce gun violence and so I mean as far as regulating people to use smart guns like forcing people to use smart guns no no definitely not but just as an option yeah so my understanding of smart guns is that they are not quite as reliable yet as they need to be in order for you to use them properly like it's the middle of the night somebody breaks into your house your hands are sweaty you grab the smart gun it doesn't operate and this has been according to at least the the gun experts that I've talked to one of the problems it's mark on if it did work right if it were reliable technology be the first thing that I would buy seriously cuz I've Yuling kids in my house now my guns are safe they're in a gun safe right and my kids don't have the code they don't have a combination or anything and we keep our guns obvious like they're in a gun safe and we make sure that they are not properly loaded so you know there's no possibility of anything happening but what I much prefer to have quicker access to a gun that's more reliable sure that would be that'd be great but I don't think the technology is quite there yet hello I'm Shawn and the part of yeah fat my UCR University and I take a very libertarian stance on drugs including hard drugs Portugal for example has had a major drug problem during the 80s and it wasn't until when they decriminalize drugs the number of drug-related deaths have dramatically gone down so what is your opinion or legalizing all drugs as you are for a non coercive government so as I've said I'm for decriminalization of marijuana I am torn I'll be honest with you I'm torn on harder drugs like for example heroin specifically because I am not convinced that the the basic argument of libertarianism is that people are capable of making rational decisions about their own lives one of the problems with addiction and drugs like heroin is that you become utterly incapable of making decisions about your own life this is one of the problems with severe addictions who hired drugs and with that said then the question just becomes efficacy you know is it more efficacious to prevent people from getting drugs by legalizing it and heavily regulating it or is it more efficacious to simply let it out onto the Mar or is it more efficacious to ban it outright and there I'd have to see the evidence on a specific drug and how it was decriminalized properly in a particular society so I will admit to not having enough information to make a call about some of the harder drugs but at the very least something obviously I don't I wish I had better solutions that something has to be done about the opioid epidemic and I'm not sure that the answer is necessarily decriminalization of opioids in a similar way to decriminalizing marijuana hey Ben my question is oftentimes I'll hear the argument that the Second Amendment protects the First Amendment so my question is why does that seem to not hold true when you look at other countries for example if you look at Japan has almost no guns but they have a protectant protection for a freedom of expression but for example if you look at Iraq and in Thailand they actually have more guns per capita in Thailand in Iraq Iraq is the sixth highest gun ownership rate and prote in the world and in Thailand you see specifically in the Constitution you are not allowed to criticize the king so my question is why does it seem like you look at these countries like Japan they don't have any guns but they have much better freedom of expression so how does that argument make any sense so the argument is basically that a country is built on a specific culture of that country so I'm not saying that the that every argument port of the Second Amendment in the United States is equally applicable everywhere although I will say that the Second Amendment is designed to prevent against ultimate government tyranny and that is I think a fairly Universal argument and the fact that people have not used their guns to protect against government tyranny in some of the places that you're mentioning that's not the fault of the guns that's the fault of the people the bottom line is that one of the reasons that you see the government fearful of violating certain rights is because there is high level of gun ownership in certain areas of America for example the reason that the right to bear arms remains pretty solid in the United States is because of the federal government ever contemplated going into Texas and taking away all the guns things would get really bad really quickly and the federal government knows that sup y'all hi I'm Robert Freeman I'm with vote matrix I'm a tech company and like you probably know a lot of technical subject to censorship by the government so I was just wondering how you would balance meeting government regulations and actually having hosting an open platform so I don't know anything about your company to start so if it turns out there's something bad about your company later I literally never heard of it it's not but it's but just to make that clear for the cameras and media matters in the room so the my view on regulation of tech companies is that I'm pretty well against virtually all of it I don't think that tech companies should should be regulated and the case that's been made for regulation of tech companies I think is fairly weak overall thank you thank you I've been I just want to start off by saying that a big fan of the show and I listen every day and used actually inspired me to start my own podcast oh great low that's great thank you thank you one thing though that I am a little bit concerned about is I would say that you don't have the best track record in terms so you make the compelling case as to why we have our rights are under attack you make the compelling case that the left is a threat for what is essentially evil in the United States not evil but destruction the destruction of American values you basically point that out but then like for example in 2016 election you were never Trumper and if Trump was not elected we would have somebody else to replace Antonin Scalia we would have had somebody else to plate replace Justice Kennedy in cases like the Alabama election Roy Moore we we saw recently how important it is to have a Senate majority and most recently in Brett Kavanaugh you said that if he was guilty of alleged sexual assault at at the age of 17 at a drunken in high school at a party that you would say that he is ineligible to be on the Supreme Court now if you truly believe in like for example in 2008 Heller versus DC well we were one vote away from misinterpreting the Second Amendment why would you suggest that you have to forego with these clear victories it's it's I think it's a moral mystery of how endangered we are as Americans to lose our rights and to lose this great rhetorical battle yeah so so as I said during the 2016 election if you believe the 2016 is the last election then you have to vote for Trump right if you believe that we're really on the precipice of tyranny and like full tyranny and then we're never gonna have another little there'll never be any recovery for the country we're literally at the cliffs point you have no choice but to vote for the lesser of the two available evils one of the what what I also said is that you know as far as president Trump number one I appreciate all the good things that he's done right I cheered Gorsuch I put on a maggot when you pet Gorsuch right when - I I've cheered I've cheered Kavanagh to a certain extent although I still would like to see his record on the bench but you know when it comes to tax cuts when it comes to Middle Eastern policy when it comes to moving to the embassy to Jerusalem when it comes to taking a harsher stance against Russia in actual harsher stance not just words but actual harsher stance presidential has been great on policy he's been really really good in a lot of different ways and I'm very grateful that he proved me wrong on all that stuff with all of that said my main concerns about President Trump were three most of the - two of those three have been alleviated one of them has not and this is this speaks to Roy Moore we still need to live in a country together and as we fall into the trap I'm saying that every decision is a lesser of two available evils we are going to start green-lighting worse and worse behavior and worse and worse standards in the name of beating the other guy and that's what you're seeing with things like Roy Moore okay so Roy Moore would he have voted for more of my priorities than Doug Jones of course he would have does it lower the general standard of America to have a credibly accused child molester in the Senate yes of course it does and if we are not willing to forego some temporary victories in order to preserve the character of the country if you believe that there is still the social fabric to preserve then we are contributing to the breakdown in that social fabric now maybe you believe the social fabric is gone and we're basically and we're basically at that point if you believe that then of course you have to back Roy Moore or whomever because you're preventing the ultimate evil this is why I'm well I while I deeply despise leftist ideology I think it's a mistake to castigate everybody who's on the political left as an enemy of the United States or to castigate the press is an enemy of the people or this kind of stuff I think it's dangerous stuff because it actually brings us closer it's a civil war than it does to any sort of cure for what ails the country even though I deeply disagree with the folks on the left as far as president Trump in the 2016 election where I stand for 2020 I had three main concerns with President Trump one is the president Trump was not going to govern conservatively that was based on his rhetoric which was all over the place he has completely alleviated my concerns on that score he is covering very very conservatively which is terrific and I'm deeply grateful for the second concern that I had was that he was going to Seoul suck the Republican Party to the extent that we were going to greenlight a bunch of policies and/or character issues that we really didn't like and there I think I was half right I mean you have the party now basically when he says stuff that like the the office of the presidency had been previously described by Bill Clinton it's not a great thing that the President of the United States says horseface right I mean like these are not wonderful things and so that's it but but my view there is that the damage has sort of already been done right he's not doing any worse damage today than he was doing yesterday he's just being himself which is like the damage was done the day he entered the office and then my so that means that that concern was both justified and alleviated based on the changing evidence and then my third concern which still is very much in order is whether he was going to toxify the image of the Republican Party among growing demographic groups in the United States that one's still very much on the table and we don't know the answer to that one yet but when you wrap that all up in a ball what that suggested that I'm more likely to vote for him in 2020 because some of my concerns have been alleviated and because circumstances have changed then I was in 2016 so that's that sort of where things are Kevin is the last one hi Ben so there is a study that shows that stays with more gun control have less gun deaths and states that border states with more gun control have less gun deaths so why do you not believe that this is evidence that gun control saves lives because if you actually look at the correlation between state gun control and the and the level of gun violence or murder rates murder rates probably better statistic in those states it looks like a it looks like a scatter plot it doesn't actually look like a direct line so for example there are states like New Hampshire and Vermont that have very lacks gun controls in very very low murder rates because as it turns out most the gun and most of the gun violence sensors in the United States our big cities and those also happen to be heavily regulated most of those big cities Washington DC Chicago and so the question of how much gun violence is in a particular state it's largely relegated to whether those cities compromise a large percentage of the population in Illinois for example or in Louisiana where New Orleans comprises a large percentage of the population has an insanely high murder rate so if you're the correlation simply doesn't actually statistically hold there's a good article in The Washington Post breaking down this data I'm trying to under the author of this I remember tweeting it out at the time all about looking at this specific argument it doesn't actually work so it's I do not think that gun control is the most effective means of preventing gun violence I think that the most effective means of preventing gun violence is the same means as preventing all violence which is establishing better family structure alleviating poverty you know a growth in economic potential these are the ways that gun violence actually goes down not taking away guns from folks particularly law abiding folks okay this is the last question right okay in response to your statement about where in the abortion where in the Constitution yes there the abortion right to abortion I want to ask you the same thing about the Heller decision where in the Constitution does it say an individual's right to a gun it doesn't say that in the Second Amendment okay what it actually says in the Second Amendment is that a militia being necessary to the preservation of a free State the right to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed right that's the actual language of the Second Amendment to understand what you mean by the militia you have to understand that that militia was a member where a bunch of individuals who would be summoned by the government to serve in that militia individual ownership of arms was extraordinarily prevalent in colonial America virtually in many in many societies in many states in colonial America the basic assumption is that if you were between the ages of 16 and 50 you were going to own a gun in your home which is why they could rely on the militia to actually assemble with any given point and go fight so there was an individual rights of their arms it is not a modifying or restricting Clause it is an explanatory clause not the same thing the the the clause that matters there is the individual is the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed the first Clause does not say if you're not a member of a militia you don't need a gun it's an explanatory clause for why guns are most necessary the formation of militias to preserve and defend freedom abroad and at home thank you so much gentlemen the big round of applause for ben shapiro thank you
