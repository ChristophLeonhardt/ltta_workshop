so last Friday President Obama gave his last press conference as commander-in-chief yeah undeterred by his would-be successors devastating loss to Donald Trump in the presidential election unswayed by Republicans complete domination of Congress state legislatures and governor mansions he maintained his cool and collected self aggrandizement why not according to Obama Obama has been a massive success perhaps the most hilarious moment of delusion came when he talked about terrorism he said over the past eight years no foreign terrorist organization has successfully executed in an attack on our homeland that was directed from overseas he then continued saying no attack had been executed in a rainstorm with the attacker driving a tractor with one hand drinking a Miller High Life with the other wearing a clown nose to be fair Obama didn't actually say that last part but he may as well have in order to find a way the problem of terrorism that has grown dramatically worldwide on his watch he simply spoke of terrorism is a problem of organized groups within defined territories which is not how terrorism actually works terrorist groups can recruit without formal structures that can operate as independent cells within various countries just three days after Obama's statements an alleged jihadi plowed her truck into a Christmas market in Berlin the same day a Turkish terrorists murdered the Russian ambassador to Turkey these latest attacks are not outliers in the past several years we've seen terrorist attacks in Turkey and Germany and Belgium Great Britain in Canada and Australia among others this sort of terrorism isn't relegated to foreign countries of course here's an incomplete list of radical Islam related terror attacks and attempts on American soil under Obama shootings of American military recruiters in Little Rock Arkansas the massacre at Fort Hood the Boston Marathon bombing and attempted bombing of the airport in Wichita Kansas Hatchett attacks on New York City police officers attempted shootings at the draw Muhammad events in Garland Texas the attacks had military recruiters in Chattanooga Tennessee the massacre at the San Bernardino inland regional center Darrell Andrew nightclub shooting the New York and New Jersey bombings in the Ohio State University car attack just to name some obama still thinks he can cover his abysmal record with closely drawn definitions of terrorism which is the equivalence of Bill Clinton saying he's been faithful to his wife except for certain areas like sex which is technically true so far as it goes but you didn't go all that far Americans know that and they reacted to Obama's consistent lying by omission by electing Trump a man who needs pretty much no evidence to jump to conclusions Obama is so careful to avoid spotting fact patterns he simply omits inconvenient data points Trump is so eager to spot fact patterns he simply includes convenient non data points but Americans would actually rather have from stumped conclusions mentality that Obama's avoid conclusions at all cost mentality Trump's mentality may lead to mistakes but those mistakes are less likely to cost Western lives so Obama can hawk his faux sophistication on terrorism as much as he wants if Democrats want to ensure that Republicans continue to win elections they ought to follow his lead I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show all righty so we are back we're back for this shortened Christmas week sorry I was on the road a little bit there's a picture that's going around of me and Ted Cruz and we are both

world is on fire of course when I'm here to the world's also on fire unlike Andrew clave now I'm out a tribute all world events to my absence from the political scene but we have to begin today by

the Democrats decided that it would be a great idea to double down on everything terrible that they ever thought about anything which is just a genius move one day thousands of years from now people will look back and they will see that Americans liked Lena Dunham or at least some Americans liked Lena Dunham for example and they will say to themselves why just why like why Lena why there's no answer I mean there's a cosmic questions that people will be asking themselves generations from now but the Democrats are addicted to Lena Dunham they love Lena Dunham because they love people who have the charisma and the and the brains and the looks of a russet potato but apparently the left just a lot of toast Oh Lena Dunham it was at the DNC as you recall they loved her so much they put her on stage at the DNC and here is what that looked like I am a pro-choice feminist sexual assault survivor with a chronic reproductive illness Donald Trump and his body think I should be punished for exercising my constitutional rights his rhetoric about women takes us back to a time when we were meant to be beautiful and silent meanwhile 22 years ago Hillary Clinton declared that women's rights are human rights okay so elements of this election cycle has been watching lena Dunham's continued mental meltdown over Donald Trump's victory well now Lena Dunham says that she wishes that she had had an abortion right she says she wishes that she'd had an abortion she said apparently she informed her audience on her podcast that while she's never had an abortion personally she wishes she had so she could do her part to reduce stigma around the issue and she said I can say I still haven't had an abortion but I wish I had okay so if Democrats are looking to win Americans probably the best way to do that is not to trot out at the DNC the lady who says that she wished that she had had a baby in her stomach just in her uterus just so that you could murder the baby so that she could feel the Solidarity and joy of having murdered a baby I mean really his pretty egregious stuff Democrats usually have the brains to cover up their enthusiasm about abortion they usually have the brains to say things like Bill Clinton safe legal and rare or it's a tragic decision a woman has to make right ignoring of course the fact that if it's a tragic decision then you shouldn't be allowed to do it right and the whole idea of legalizing abortion rests on the notion that it's not a tragic decision it's the same thing as removing Apollo but the Democrats usually don't speak in those lang in that sort of language because they understand that alienates people but Lena Dunham full-on embraces it she says that she wishes that she'd had an abortion so she could be part of the Select sisterhood of women who have engaged and and pursued the use of the right to murder a baby in her womb if this is the sort of thing that Democrats think is going to win elections by all means they should continue to because the fact is the vast majority of Americans don't think that abortion is a is a pro-social thing to do they don't think that abortion is a good thing to do even people who are pro-choice generally don't think abortion is a good thing they may think it's a necessary thing but most of them don't think it's a good thing because most of them still have a basic semblance of Uncle discomfort with abortion she actually said on this podcast that that was one of her one of the reasons she wishes she'd had one because people were talking about their abortions and she felt uncomfortable because deep down and lena Dunham's body there still resides a small spark of godly soul that says to her yeah you should be uncomfortable with people killing babies and she says I want to extinguish that by presumably getting pregnant and killing the baby she's now come out and apologized because whenever Democrats get caught doing stuff they come out and apologize falsely but that's of course what she thinks and that's not the only way in which Democrats have lost their minds and are doubling down on everything radical that they can possibly conceive of the other thing that came out over the last couple of days is of course this insane insane insane video from MTV so MTV released a video of a bunch of people who you would never want to associate with in real life like people who you just look at them and how smug and self-satisfied they're and you think I would not want to be within a hundred miles of these folks MTV released a video of resolutions for four white guys for 2017 they're telling you what your resolutions should be because there's nothing more ideologically fascistic than telling other people what they should aspire to be in the coming year here's MTV informing you remember what MTV used to put on music videos remember that yeah not anymore this is what it is now it's about to be a new year and there's a few things we think you could do a little bit better in 2017 first off try to recognize that America was never great for anyone who wasn't a white guy can we all just agree that black lives matter isn't the opposite of all eyes matter okay so sorry Austin is running back and forth to CV screen to computer it's amusing to watch I'm gonna continue this pattern but it's but that I love that the first gal gets options can we agree America was never great for anyone who wasn't a white male no we can't agree on that at all as a Jew with ancestors who were Jews I can pretty much agree America's the greatest country that God ever created by the way for black people living in today's America America is the greatest country that God ever created and even during Jim Crow America was a much better country for black people than the vast majority of countries around the world which is not a case in favor of Jim Crow god forbid but to suggest that America was never great for anybody except white men is just a bunch of crap I mean how about white women by the way white women have had a better in America than any place else on earth I mean America is is heaven for white women in white women now earned more than white men white women are going to college at a higher rate than white men even in the supposedly horrific terrible horrible horrible terrible 50s women were actually pretty happy if you look at the pulse of female satisfaction because they were living in a prosperous country and what a bunch of knots and then this woman says can we just agree that black lives matter doesn't just mean black lives matter all lives mattered is not a response to black lives matter no because the entire black lives matter movement is predicated on the notion that black lives are specifically under difference assault on other lives in the United States by white people and that is not true and then I do love the fact that where they go next in the 17 video is they say black lives matter you know it doesn't all eyez matter is not a proper response to black lives matter because of course all lives matter but we're just talking about black lives now and then the next thing they say is that not all lives matter black lives just matter there's no need to overcomplicate it also blue lives matter isn't a thing cops ball ball with blue skin right I mean dead they won't form blue stop bragging about being woke stop saying woke learn what mansplaining is and then stop doing it oh and if you're a judge don't prioritize the well-being of making Austin run back and forth is really amusing okay so don't you whoa how about you stop using loke it's obnoxious and no one knows what the hell you're talking about yeah oh you're woke woke - what did you awake did you wake up what why are you using a passive verb in place of an active one in any case that I do love the the I don't use woke also stop mansplaining to stop mansplaining to us man's planning is the stupidest word that anyone ever created mansplaining okay it's called an explanation if a man is doing it and it is worthwhile that does not mean that he's doing it as a man okay men used to have a word for women's blaming it was called nagging okay this is routine because these people desperately this is donald trump's reelection ad right here and it's fun to watch Ivy League athlete over the woman he assaulted we all love Beyonce and yes she's black so of course she cares about bike issues I'm talking to you FoxNews feel free to take Kanye West though you guys can happen you know what you did Kanye nobody who has black friends says that they have black friends it's just because you have black friends doesn't mean you're not racist you're gonna be racing with black friends look guys we know nobody's perfect but honestly you could do a little better in 2017 some of you guys do a great job some of you don't please because 2016 is bad 2017 can't be worse than this all right because this is bad okay I'm gonna listen to the to the black guy with the cat on his shirt telling me about what it means to be a better person because he's a black guy with a cat on a shirt that's basically what this comes down to I mean this video comes down to it's a bunch of not white males lecturing white males and that's okay because they have a moral superiority because they're not white males here's my question what do these people actually do does anyone know any of these people like I don't know any of these people I don't know them from Adam I don't care what color they are what their sex is doesn't matter to me do they do decent things I mean for all I know these people that this is a series of axe murderers that went to San Quentin and dragged out of prison to lecture white males the idea that these folks are granted some extra legitimacy because of their color or because of their sex well what a bunch of absolute nonsense I also love the fact there's an irony to the fact that you have the the one guy saying just because you don't say you have black friends that doesn't mean that you're not a racist and then this entire video is built around the concept that because they're showing a bunch of black people showing some black people and some Hispanic people sebacean people because they're showing various diverse people that means they can be racist against white people right so there's a certain irony to that as well but again all of this is designed all of this is designed not to win elections it is designed to further polarize the population they think that demographically in the next election cycle they're gonna have some advantages because they think that by 2020 Millennials will represent people who are currently Millennials will represent 40% of the voting base they think that the Hispanic base is gonna grow they think that they're just gonna out demographics the rest of the United States but it turns out that that's not how politics works as late as two years ago Democrats were saying we'd never win well six months ago Democrats were saying Republicans would never win another presidential election in 2008 their idea was Republicans who never win back Congress by 2010 they had people are people they have ideas their brains function and they're not just a set of physical characteristics on the outside and so you can't just suggest that white people are bad and everybody else is good and then hope to win elections that's not how any of this works but again Democrats don't know this and so they keep doubling down on the stupid I one of the more amusing sites over the weekend by the way was was Bill Clinton on Monday cast his electoral vote he was one of the electors from New York and he was hoping he'd be casting the winning electoral votes for Hillary he cast his electoral votes and he wept as he realized that Hillary would now be lurking around Chappaquiddick or Chappaqua some more and he'd have to find a different outhouse to stash his mistress yeah but I've never cast about I was prouder of you know I watched her work for two years I watched her battle through that bogus email deals be vindicated the engine secretary Powell's book and out she fought through that she fought through everything and she prevailed against at all but you know at the end we had to rush into me and the FBI do we she couldn't prevail against that she did everything experts the finest vote counter in america is nate silver he told you what cost of the election okay and then bill clinton by the way said that trump only knows how to win angry white males that was as those a summation of the election bill should know since that was a large part of his base in 1992 and 1996 where the same dispossessed white folks that voted for Trump voted for Bo Clinton in 1992 and 1996 again all of this stuff is just alienating the same voters they just lost there's no purpose to it other than they think that the demographics are going to save them demographics don't save you once you decide to blow off half the population more than half the population okay so now we gotta say hello before we go any further and we have some pretty stunning video coming up and a lot more to talk about including Trump's infrastructure plans and the and the the continued fallout from from what's happening over in Turkey and Russia but first we have to say hello to our advertisers over at sea so so see SOCOM is the place for comedy if you are interested in in watching comedy if you're a comedy addict then see SOCOM is for you use the promo code bending a tube three months they

really funny see SOCOM is the place to be 399 a month my wife and I really really enjoy it so see so calm use that promo code bed and get two months for free okay so again Democrats are intent on losing 2020 the same way they lost 2016 and so during the electoral college vote on Monday you can see how the protesters reacted to Wisconsin electors voting for Donald Trump go to Warren that is a crazy lady before the sava protesters one of the protesters has a ball the sense of Donald J Trump yeah that way too way to really draw in those voters and and really convince people that they were wrong screaming at the electors whose job it is to just confirm the vote and then there's this video which has been making the rounds this apparently is a trump supporter being beaten and dragged out of his car this is going around a couple of weeks ago apparently he's okay but this this video has been going around as well and then there is this guy being dragged alongside the car oh yeah that is awful so yeah that kind of stuff is definitely gonna help win Democrats back there they're voting base that they lost in this particular election cycle all so they can continue to Foskey Thole berman who has completely lost what was left of his tiny mind what was not occupied by his by his kittens and his agriculture degree from Cornell he's lost what was left of it and and now he is saying the best way to resist Trump is to never say president Trump never say it not using one word can be just as forceful as perpetually use another never address Trump as president he is Trump just Trump never president the title of president that we must protect for a happier and more honest time resistance means refusal resist peace he's been reduced to saying single words at a time because he can't speak in phrases anymore as his brain breaks down in front if you think that Republicans are going to be devastated because Keith Olbermann doesn't call him president Trump yeah right I also remember don't you remember when all the Democrats were saying that if you called Obama Obama and not President Obama it was racist that was the thing like very early on in his presidency if he called him Barack Hussein Obama fused his middle name that was racist and if he used his last name only that was racist you had to call him President Barack Obama or President Obama but you can do it against Trump and that is a way to resist peace I'm inside a box no one knows how to get out it's amazing and then he Keith Oldman may in fact be the first actual live speaking mime he's not actually a silent man he actually speaks and finally you have Robert Reich she's the former secretary of a labor under under Bill Clinton and he has a proposal to stop Donald Trump and here it is a lot of people are analyzing what's going right on right now not a lot are doing what you did and actually talking about a resistance agenda that talks about getting Democrats in Congress and across the country to pledge to oppose the Trump agenda to boycotting all Trump products real estate hotels resorts everything around the world can you go through what you're suggesting yes Amy generally I think we do have to regard this as not a normal presidency you know some people say oh well it's just a we've had conservative pompous narcissistic presidents before this is this is not normal this is really dangerous and we have to resist we have to have a peaceful they keep doing this we have to resist okay your resistance is just tears that Donald Trump will swing at night the idea that your boycott is gonna do anything to the Trump Organization is absolutely nonsense he now has the biggest brand on planet Earth he's the President of the United States so Robert righteous boycott means nothing also that you keep hearing Democrats use these sorts of words like we cannot normalize Trump we can't just say it's the new normal we can't normalize him it's not up to you it's not up to you he's gonna do it he's gonna do and people are either gonna like it or they ain't gonna like it but you don't get to decide what's normal you guys decided that Barack Obama's behavior as president was normal you decided that Bill Clinton's behavior as president was normal you don't get to decide what's normal and what's not I mean in your world it is not normal for a Christian Baker to be able to not bake a cake for a same-sex wedding but it is normal for a nine year old boy to be a nine year old girl so you definitely do not get to define normal for me you definitely not get to define normal I'm fine with the idea that Trump does things that are abnormal but Robert Ryan company do not get to decide what is abnormal and what should be normalized and what should not because they are so far beyond the pale of what is what is even reasonable that to have them draw the outer limit of normal and put Trump beyond that is just ridiculous okay so that brings us the end of our live broadcast at fit at Facebook
