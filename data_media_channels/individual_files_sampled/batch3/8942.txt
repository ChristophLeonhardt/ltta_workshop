INFORMANT WILL BE MADE ACCESSIBLE. Bret: CATHERINE HERRIDGE IN WASHINGTON. THANK YOU. MORE ON THIS WITH THE PANEL. TOP HOUSE REPUBLICANS AS RUSSIA'S GOAL IS TO CREATE CHAOS DURING THE UPCOMING MIDTERM ELECTIONS. HOW TO PREVENT THAT IS A MAJOR TALKING POINT TONIGHT. FOLLOWING A HIGH-LEVEL BRIEFING FROM SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS. CORRESPONDENT PETER DOOCY TELLS US FROM CAPITOL HILL APPARENTLY MANY IN CONGRESS ARE NOT THAT INTERESTED. IN A ROOM BENEATH THE CAPITAL, THE INTEL CHIEFS WHO CAME TO DELIVER A CLASSIFIED BRIEFING ABOUT ELECTION INTERFERENCE THAT EVERY HOUSE MEMBER WAS INVITED TO SHARE THOSE SECRETS WITH A LOT OF EMPTY SEATS. I WOULD SAY WE HAD 40 OR SO MEMBERS THAT ATTENDED. THAT'S 40 OUT OF 428 MEMBERS SERVING RIGHT NOW. ONE THEORY: CONGRESS DIDN'T WANT TO COMMUTE AN HOUR EARLY. HOMELAND SECURITY CHAIRMAN WAS SURPRISED SO MANY LAWMAKERS WHO TALK ABOUT ELECTION INTERFERENCE BLEW OFF THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, FBI DIRECTOR, AND DHS SECRETARY. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE THIS SUCH A BIG ISSUE AND ASKED FOR THIS BRIEFING FOR A LONG TIME AND WE FINALLY SCHEDULE IT AND IT'S CLASSIFIED AND 30 MEMBERS SHOW UP. EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS NOT RETIRING IS UP FOR REELECTION AND THE MIDTERMS BUT NONE ARE KNOWN TO BE IN THE CROSS HAIRS OF FOREIGN METALLURGIST. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NO INTEL THAT THERE IS A PARTICULAR INTEREST. SECRETARY NIELSEN SAID CHINA AND IRAN ARE CONSIDERED THREATS TO ELECTION INTEGRITY BUT THAT KIND OF INTERFERENCE THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT IN 2018 IS THE SAME KIND ELECTED IN 2016 WHERE BALLOTS AREN'T CHANGED BY SOCIAL MEDIA IS MANIPULATED TO CAUSE CHAOS. I THINK WE REMAIN CONCERNED CERTAINLY ON THE FOREIGN INFLUENCE I'VE HEARD WE HAVE SEEN THAT CONTINUALLY. DETAILS LIKE THAT DID NOT DAZZLE THE DEMOCRATS WHO DID ATTEND. I DIDN'T HEAR ONE BIT OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. THERE WAS NOTHING THAT I COULDN'T HAVE READ IN "USA TODAY" THAT WAS REVEALED. SO THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A LOW ATTENDANCE, IT DOESN'T MATTER. THIS WAS THE RARE RUSSIA-RELATED EVENT ON CAPITOL HILL THAT HAPPENED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, SO IT'S GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE IF THE HUNDREDS OF LAWMAKERS WHO DECIDED THEY DIDN'T WANT THE CLASSIFIED UPDATE TODAY DECIDED TO SHOW UP TO THE NEXT RUSSIA HEARING WHERE THE CAMERAS ARE ROLLING THE WHOLE TIME. BRET. Bret: PETER, MOMENTS AGO THE HOUSE PASSED LEGISLATION TO EASE BANKING RULES, ESSENTIALLY A REFORM OF THE DODD-FRANK LAW. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE BILL THAT'S ACTUALLY NOW HEADED TO THE PRESIDENT'S DESK? IT'S MAKING LIFE EASIER FOR SMALLER BANKS IN THIS COUNTRY. AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WITH THE DODD-FRANK REGULATIONS, THE FEDS PUT THE STRICTEST REGULATIONS ON BANKS THAT WERE WORTH $50 BILLION OR MORE. THEY SAID THOSE BANKS ARE TOO BIG TO FAIL. THEY MUST BE REGULAR. NOW TOO BIG TO FAIL IS BIGGER. $250 BILLION, FIVE TIMES THAT SIZE, IS NOW THE "TOO BIG TO FAIL" THRESHOLD WHICH MEANS THAT A LOT OF SMALLER BANKS ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT FEWER REGULATIONS. THIS DOES NOT REPEAL DODD-FRANK BUT IT DOES ROLLBACK A LOT OF IMPORTANT REGULATIONS AND IT IS THE RARE MEASURE THAT VERY
