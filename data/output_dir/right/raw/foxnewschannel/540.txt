PROTESTED A AND FORCED OUT

17
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:34,449
OF THE RESTAURANT.

18
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:35,117
STEVE: THEY WEREN'T FORCED

19
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:36,618
OUT OF THE RESTAURANT.

20
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:37,652
THE RESTAURANT ESCORTED THEM

21
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:40,288
TO A PRIVATE AREA.

22
00:00:40,288 --> 00:00:41,456
AINSLEY: THEY DID PROTECT.

23
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:42,524
STEVE: THEY WENT IN AND

24
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:43,792
FINISHED THEIR MEAL.

GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE.

00:00:46,294 --> 00:00:47,162
YOU KNOW HIM A MEMBER OF

00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:49,564
CONGRESS ON HOLD RIGHT NOW.

29
00:00:49,564 --> 00:00:50,232
MR. DESANTIS, WHAT DO YOU

30
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:52,200
MAKE OF GOING ON A NUMBER OF

31
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,502
PROTESTERS WHO SEE PUBLIC

32
00:00:53,502 --> 00:00:55,570
FIGURES AND THEN JUST KIND

33
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,007
OF TRY TO DRIVE THEM OFF?

34
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:01,109
>> I THINK THE LEFT IS

35
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:01,910
TOTALLY UNHINGED AND THEY

36
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,477
HAVE BEEN.

37
00:01:02,477 --> 00:01:03,979
IT'S NOT JUST WHAT THEY DID

38
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:04,980
TO SENATOR CRUZ.

39
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,314
OBVIOUSLY YOU SAW THE

40
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:07,215
KAVANAUGH HEARINGS WHICH IS

41
00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:08,183
A TOTAL DISGRACE.

42
00:01:08,183 --> 00:01:09,584
THIS STUFF CAN BE REALLY

43
00:01:09,584 --> 00:01:09,951
DANGEROUS.

44
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:11,920
IF YOU REMEMBER, LAST YEAR,

45
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,821
OUR REPUBLICAN BASEBALL

46
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:13,889
PRACTICE WAS SHOT UP BY ONE

47
00:01:13,889 --> 00:01:15,624
OF THESE LEFT WING

48
00:01:15,624 --> 00:01:15,991
ACTIVISTS.

49
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:17,759
SO THIS IS REALLY, REALLY A

50
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,461
BAD ROAD TO GO DOWN.

51
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:20,896
AND, YOU KNOW, LOOK, IF I

52
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,431
WAS A PRO-FRIRT OF THAT

53
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:23,766
STUFF I WOULD HAVE NO

54
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:24,767
TOLERANCE OF THAT STUFF IN

55
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:25,434
MY ESTABLISHMENT.

56
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:27,536
YOU WANT PEOPLE TO EAT IN

57
00:01:27,536 --> 00:01:27,903
PEACE.

58
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:28,837
STEVE: THEY DID ESCORT THEM

59
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:29,605
INTO PRIVACY.

60
00:01:29,605 --> 00:01:31,173
>> BOTTOM LINE IS IF I

61
00:01:31,173 --> 00:01:32,274
WALKED INTO A BAR OR

62
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:34,109
RESTAURANT AND I STARTED

63
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:35,377
THROWING PUNCHES, I WOULD BE

64
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:36,045
TOSSED OFF.

65
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:37,212
THESE PEOPLE WALKING AND

66
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:38,347
SCREAMING AND NOW THE

67
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:40,049
SENATOR AND HIS WIFE HAVE TO

68
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:40,349
LEAVE.

69
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:46,088
WHY IS THIS ALLOWED?

70
00:01:46,088 --> 00:01:56,398
THIS ANARCHY, BLAMING HIM

71
00:01:56,398 --> 00:01:58,233
FOR RED TIDE GOT HIM THROWN

72
00:01:58,233 --> 00:01:59,068
OUT OF THE RESTAURANT.

73
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:03,238
WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR

74
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:03,539
STATE?

75
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:06,842
>> YOU HAVE FAR LEFT WING

76
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:09,110
FRINGE REPRESENTED BY ANDREW

77
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,445
GILLUM.

78
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:10,346
THEY ARE RADICAL AND GOING

79
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:12,648
TO DO WHATEVER THEY CAN

80
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:14,550
NORMAL PROCESSES TO

81
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,584
INTIMIDATE PEOPLE WHO

82
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:16,418
DISAGREE WITH THEM.

83
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:17,720
THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRACY SAUL

84
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,020
ABOUT.

85
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,988
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE

86
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:19,355
CIVILITY.

87
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:21,523
THAT'S BEEN TOSSED OUT THE

88
00:02:21,523 --> 00:02:21,924
WINDOW.

89
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:22,591
AINSLEY: THE RESTAURANT DID

90
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:23,192
SEND OUT A TWEET.

91
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:28,197
THE RESTAURANT IS CALLED FEE

92
00:02:28,197 --> 00:02:30,366
WHEN THE SITUATION RESOLVED

93
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:31,267
THE GUEST RETURNED TO THANK

94
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:32,802
THE STAFF FOR THEIR SUPPORT

95
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:35,671
AND FINISH THEIR EXCEPTIONAL

96
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:35,971
MEAL.

97
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:36,972
YOU MENTIONED WITH HECKLERS

98
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:37,873
COME INTO THE MIDDLE OF A

99
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:39,675

100

101
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:40,576
IT'S AWFUL.

102
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:41,410
I DON'T EVEN THINK THEY

103
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,878
SHOULD BE ALLOWED IN THERE

104
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:44,280
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU IT

105
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,414
JUST DELAYS EVERYTHING.

106
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:46,716
THAT'S IN FRONT OF A GROUP.

107
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:49,852
IT'S NOT AS EMBARRASSING.

108
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:52,521
IF YOU ARE SINGLED OUT AND

109
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:54,390
SOMEONE VIDEOTAPES IT AND

110
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,857
GOES NATIONAL.

111
00:02:54,857 --> 00:02:55,424
>> ABSOLUTELY.

112
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:59,161
I THINK THAT IS JUST AN

113
00:02:59,161 --> 00:02:59,962
INVASION OF PEOPLE'S PEACE

114
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,163
OF MIND AND PRIFSZ TO HAVE A

115
00:03:01,163 --> 00:03:02,598
MEAL WITH YOUR FAMILY.

116
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:03,799
JUST TACTICS THAT I THINK

117
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:06,402
MOST AMERICANS REJECT.

118
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:07,269
STEVE: LET'S TALK A LITTLE

119
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:08,571
BIT ABOUT THE HOUSE FREEDOM

120
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:08,904
CAUCUS.

121
00:03:08,904 --> 00:03:10,373
THEY ARE CALLING ON ROD

122
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:11,140
ROSENSTEIN EITHER TESTIFY IN

123
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,375
FRONT OF THEM OR QUIT.

124
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,509
WE DO KNOW THAT HE IS GOING

125
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:14,410
TO SHOW UP AT THE WHITE

126
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,344
HOUSE TOMORROW AND THEY ARE

127
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:16,979
GOING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

128
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,583
ABOUT THESE MEMOS THAT HE

129
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,418
APPARENTLY WROTE -- RATHER,

130
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:24,387
ANDY MCCABE WROTE DISCUSSING

131
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:25,655
THAT ROSENSTEIN HAD OFFERED

132
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:28,524
TO WEAR A WIRE AND DISCUSS

133
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:30,259
THE WHOLE 25TH AMENDMENT

134
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:31,427
THING, LET'S GET RID OF THE

135
00:03:31,427 --> 00:03:32,395
PRESIDENT AND THINGS LIKE

136
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:32,695
THAT.

137
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:33,996
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE

138
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:35,197
HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS WHICH

139
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:36,265
IS VERY POWERFUL ON THE

140
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:38,100
REPUBLICAN SIDE IN THE HOUSE

141
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,235
DEMANDING THIS?

142
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:40,269
>> WELL, HE NEEDS TO ANSWER

143
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:40,970
THOSE QUESTIONS.

144
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,439
I MEAN, IF THAT IS TRUE,

145
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,140
CLEARLY, THAT'S

146
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,574
DISQUALIFYING.

147
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:46,075
TO TALK ABOUT THE 25TH

148
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:47,677
AMENDMENT, THAT IS JUST

149
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:48,845
TOTALLY OUTRAGEOUS.

150
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:50,279
TO SAY YOU ARE GOING TO RUN

151
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:51,147
A SURVEILLANCE OPERATION

152
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,149
AGAINST A SITTING PRESIDENT

153
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,150
FOR NO REASON?

154
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,119
AND OBVIOUSLY HE APPOINTED A

155
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:56,919
SPECIAL COUNSEL WITHOUT

156
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,687
HAVING GOOD REASON.

157
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:59,322
SO HE WAS BUNGLING A LOT OF

158
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,790
THINGS AROUND THAT TIME

159
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,124
PERIOD.

160
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:01,891
BUT, I WOULD SAY THIS.

161
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:02,925
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS

162
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:03,860
BEEN ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO BE

163
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,796
CAUTIOUS ABOUT THIS.

164
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:07,563
YOU KNOW FOR THE "NEW YORK

165
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:09,432
TIMES" TO RUN THAT I'M JUST

166
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:11,067
SKEPTICAL ABOUT THEIR

167
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:11,467
MOTIVATIONS.

168
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:12,535
I WONDER WHETHER IT'S TIED

169
00:04:12,535 --> 00:04:14,070
TO MCCABE.

170
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,271
MCCABE OBVIOUSLY ISN'T

171
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:16,139
TERRIBLY CREDIBLE.

172
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,173
I DO THINK HE NEEDS TO

173
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:17,940
ANSWER QUESTIONS UNDER OATH.

174
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,377
IF HE DID DO IT, THEN IT'S

175
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:21,878
DISQUALIFYING.

176
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:23,546
BRIAN: LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR

177
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:24,714
RACE YOU SAID ENOUGH OF

178
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:25,582
WASHINGTON I HAVE GOT TO

179
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:26,416
FOCUS ON FLORIDA.

180
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,750
YOU ARE RUNNING AGAINST

181
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,018
ANDREW GILLUM ON THE LEFT.

182
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,420
IS HE WAY TO THE LEFT ON THE

183
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,321
LEFT.

184
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:32,655
MOST POLLS YOU ARE TRAILING,

185
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:34,290
YET, YOU ARE REPLACING A

186
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,892
GOVERNOR WHO IS HANDING OVER

187
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:38,294
A STATE IN SURPLUS THAT BY

188
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:40,163
ALMOST ALL ACCOUNTS IS DOING

189
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:40,997
EXCEEDINGLY WELL.

190
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:43,466
WHAT MESSAGE DO YOU HAVE TO

191
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:45,735
GET OUT RON DESANTIS?

192
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:46,770
>> MY MESSAGE AND VISION FOR

193
