00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,620
Here's a look at it on the satellite picture, and...

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,200
Boy, this is not good.

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,350
It's exhausting knowing that you work a lifetime to acquire things,

4
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:26,530
You know, homes and different things of that nature. And then it all can be taken away so easily.

5
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,660
As we're coming on the tenth year anniversary,

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,900
talking about all of it, brings back a lot.

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:50,829
Everybody's Katrina is different. There's a lot of similarities, but there's so many different personal stories.

8
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:53,300
Okay guys, here's the deal in Gulfport.

9
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,700
As we mentioned, we were at 27 feet above sea level. Guess what? That's not high enough.

10
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,700
Basically we are part of the Gulf of Mexico right now.

11
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,700
I've got to ask you a question -- what are the options?

12
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:15,700
This is the first moment I've started to grasp what Hurricane Katrina has done.

13
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,700
Because everything we know is gone.

14
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:26,700
And I remember for a second I couldn't breathe. It kind of felt silly, but it was just that overwhelming.

15
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:34,900
And I remember getting to this one woman who was crying, and she said 'it killed my mother'

16
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,900
And I said 'what do you mean it killed your mother?'

17
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:45,000
And she said 'our house was full of water and I was holding her hand, and I was holding her hand. And then I couldn't do it anymore.'

18
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,400
An entire ward of this city -- the 9th Ward -- appears to be up to its rooftops in water.

19
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:03,100
That Monday morning it was dry. The storm had passed. But then, the levees started breaking.

20
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:09,700
When that water came, it knocked down houses. I mean, prone 'em up.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,900
And water just kept getting higher and higher. It seemed as though water was racing me up the ladder.

22
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,000
As we was walking up the bridge, there were people that I had seen every day. Dead.

23
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,300
We walked one way, they was alive. We walked back, they was dead.

24
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,300
Riding in that truck, we were tired, but no one knew what to say.

25
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,700
And as we turned off I-10 down into Hancock County to work our way down to Bay St. Louis

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:54,700
which was just a little coastal city, it was the most surreal bizarre scene I've seen.

27
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:03,200
The headlights are on, and people -- just bunches of people -- are walking north along this roadway.

28
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,600
Their clothes are shredded and they all look shell shocked.

29
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,300
Katrina taught me a lot of good things. And a lot of bad things.

30
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
It changed my life.

31
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:28,300
When you're at your home and in your city, that's where you find your normalcy, and none of it was there.

32
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:38,300
It's not about no money; it's about being treated like a person.

33
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,300
It's hard to explain, it really is.

34
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,300
I guess it's not a physical thing, it's more of a psychological thing.

35
00:03:46,300 --> 00:00:00,000
I lost my house, I lost my friends. You mourn what you lost, but eventually you have to move on.
