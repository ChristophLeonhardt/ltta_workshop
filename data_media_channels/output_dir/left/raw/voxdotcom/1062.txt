1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,600
You guys are not going to believe

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,230
what Trump just tweeted.

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:03,800
He–

4
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,300
Uh oh.

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,160
Sorry.

6
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,080
Try it again.

7
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,200
You guys are not going to believe what Trump—

8
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,780
Jesus.

9
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,700
What's wrong?

10
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,880
Um.

11
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,600
Nothing.

12
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,300
One more time.

13
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,520
You guys are not going to—

14
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,780
You know what?

15
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,440
Never mind.

16
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,040
Twitter's harassment problem is out of control

17
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,880
and it's changing the way we talk about

18
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,620
free speech on the internet.

19
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,670
Before we talk about what Twitter is,

20
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,009
we should talk about what Twitter was supposed
to be.

21
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,200
In the preamble to its original rules, Twitter
stated:

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,560
except in limited circumstances.”

23
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,440
In other words,

24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,280
Twitter was supposed to be a neutral platform

25
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,469
where you could say anything to anyone

26
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:48,860
with very few rules.

27
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,290
Twitter, and Blogger before it, were very
interested in

28
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,060
kind of committing to that principle of free
speech.

29
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,460
If you get the barriers out of the way, speech
will happen,

30
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,949
rich discussion will happen, the best ideas
will bubble forth.

31
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:03,149
That's Tarleton Gillespie, who's been studying
speech

32
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,489
on the internet since Napster was around.

33
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,540
What's Napster?

34
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,960
Am I old?

35
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,119
Twitter prided itself on being an anti-censorship
platform,

36
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,890
especially after it played a role in the Arab
Spring uprisings in 2011.

37
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,979
That was a very compelling idea for what Twitter
could be,

38
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:19,389
what citizen journalism could be.

39
00:01:19,389 --> 00:01:20,930
For a while, Twitter talked about themselves
as

40
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,450
the free speech wing of the free speech party.

41
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,649
Twitter's commitment to free speech was

42
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:26,789
baked into its design and structure.

43
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:27,990
You can tweet anonymously,

44
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,829
meaning you won't be punished for your opinions.

45
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:31,000
You can tweet at whoever you want,

46
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,469
meaning you don't need permission to talk
to

47
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:33,999
politicians and celebrities.

48
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:35,249
And maybe most importantly,

49
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:37,920
beyond copyright infringement and impersonation,

50
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,939
Twitter was not interested in monitoring what
you tweeted.

51
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,020
That was a very powerful commitment
for them

52
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,000
and made them design their tool in really
compelling ways.

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,240
Sorry, one second.

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,520
Jesus, someone tweeted that?

55
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,959
No, it's a text from my mom.

56
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,639
Twitter began as a radical experiment in free
speech.

57
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:59,020
But over time that experiment started to fall
apart

58
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,049
because the same features that made Twitter

59
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,429
so attractive to citizen journalists and political
dissidents

60
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:07,149
also made it a perfect environment for trolls:

61
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:09,758
neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and misogynists.

62
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,310
These users realized they could use Twitter's
anonymity

63
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,569
and structure to target and harass people
they didn't agree with.

64
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,460
And before long,

65
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,459
Twitter had a massive PR problem on their
hands.

66
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,370
Every few weeks, another story about Twitter

67
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,099
being overrun by abuse —

68
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,620
high-profile users like journalists, celebrities,
and authors

69
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,909
leaving the platform because of Twitter's
inability

70
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:30,100
to deal with harassment.

71
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,129
One of those users was Lindy West.

72
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:34,879
I am a contributing opinion writer for the
New York Times.

73
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,629
I wrote a book called Shrill that came out
in 2016.

74
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:40,760
I'm just a general sort of internet feminist.

75
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,409
West loved Twitter at first.

76
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:43,409
But over time,

77
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:46,480
her work made her the target of brutal harassment
campaigns.

78
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,349
Very quickly, my experience on Twitter became

79
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:50,730
one of endless constant harassment.

80
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,730
I'll just read them.

81
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,810
"No need for you to worry about rape, uggo."

82
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,920
"That big bitch is bitter that no one wants
to rape her."

83
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,489
"What a fucking cunt."

84
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:00,890
"Kill yourself you dumb bitch."

85
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,890
Is that enough?

86
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,519
Oh, there's so many more.

87
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,730
West recognized early on that that harassment

88
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,829
wasn't just mean.

89
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:07,820
It had a purpose.

90
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,700
They want you removed from the national conversation

91
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:18,640
and removed from whatever little shred of
power

92
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,030
you've managed to achieve.

93
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,400
And Twitter realized it too.

94
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,960
In 2015, former CEO Dick Costolo told employees,

95
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,080
Twitter's radical free speech experiment had
failed.

96
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,620
If you have a commitment to free speech

97
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:40,859
and some of your users are being shouted down,

98
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:43,079
threatened, and driven off the platform,

99
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,269
something's happening to their speech.

100
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:47,200
The idea that you can be neutral without any
moderation

101
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,660
is an illusion, and it's a very lazy, self-serving
illusion.

102
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,420
Sorry, sorry.

103
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,840
Twitter again?

104
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,840
So this is where things start to get really
dicey,

105
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,609
because Twitter has to answer this basic

106
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:12,139
but messy question:

107
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,579
Is Twitter really a neutral service provider,

108
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:17,899
like Verizon or Comcast, offering a semi-public
platform

109
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,649
without caring about what happens on it?

110
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,388
Or had Twitter become something else,

111
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:23,470
a community moderator that cares about

112
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,919
the content and behavior of its users?

113
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,670
So far Twitter's answer has been:

114
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,670
Eeeeeh.

115
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,150
On one hand, the company is clearly moving
away

116
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,120
from its radical free speech roots.

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,560
Twitter has slowly introduced tougher

118
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,460
and tougher rules for dealing with harassment,

119
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,199
prohibiting things like violent threats

120
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,780
and incitements to harass.

121
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,520
And in October, Twitter announced new rules

122
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,120
to deal with violent groups and hateful images.

123
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,699
Those are positive developments for victims
of abuse,

124
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:48,810
but enforcing those rules is making Twitter
answer

125
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,950
tougher and tougher questions about users’
content.

126
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,520
Is this harassment?

127
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,919
What about this?

128
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,870
What about now?

129
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,990
Is this harassment?

130
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,770
What about now?

131
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,400
Is this an example of hate speech?

132
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,580
What about this?

133
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
Is this a violent threat?

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,920
How about now?

135
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,180
What about now?

136
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,520
Is this a hate image?

137
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,140
What about this?

138
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,820
How about now?

139
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,250
Is this a dangerous group?

140
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,590
What about this?

141
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,310
There's no neutral way to answer these questions.

142
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,729
The amount of accounts they're looking at,

143
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,800
the kind of range they're looking at,

144
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,699
how they judge what someone's doing,

145
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,360
what their intent is, whether they're reading

146
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,250
the situation correctly, those are immensely
difficult things to do.

147
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,940
Twitter won't say how it's going to make these
calls.

148
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,060
It's just asking us to trust them.

149
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,000
And West worries those decisions might

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,800
end up making the problem worse.

151
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
The waters really get muddied.

152
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,930
I know black activists whose accounts

153
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,259
have been shut down for criticizing white
people

154
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,260
because it's "racist."

155
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,340
At the same time, Twitter still wants to be
treated

156
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,919
like a neutral speech platform.

157
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,590
In July, a month before the white supremacist
rally

158
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,360
in Charlottesville, Twitter rolled out

159
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,879
a "see every side" ad campaign,

160
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,729
celebrating its "everything's cool" approach
to politics.

161
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:11,080
Yep, that's a frat bro,

162
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,569
Chadwick I'm assuming,

163
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:14,470
tweeting about climate change being fake.

164
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,470
Sweet Chadwick.

165
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,770
When current Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was asked

166
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,240
what kind of tool Twitter is, Dorsey responded

167
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,280
To what?

168
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,139
What does that mean?

169
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,580
Closer to neo-Nazis?

170
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,440
Closer to the targets of our harassment?

171
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,740
Twitter is stuck between these competing visions

172
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,740
of its responsibility to its users.

173
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,629
Which is how we end up with a website that
bans

174
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,780
white supremacist content but verifies

175
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,220
actual white supremacists.

176
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,940
I don't envy Twitter.

177
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,630
You know, it's a huge problem.

178
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,830
It's very, very complicated.

179
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,020
I don't know how to fix it.

180
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,680
Did you tweet this at me?

181
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,360
Wrap it up!

182
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,020
Fine, look.

183
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,980
Any platform with rules has to have

184
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,180
a reason for those rules,

185
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,930
a goal those rules are trying to advance.

186
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,930
Twitter doesn't right now.

187
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,939
But by starting to crack down on abuse,

188
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:03,240
Twitter is kind of opening Pandora's box,

189
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,909
opening itself up to more and more responsibility

190
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:07,539
for what happens on its platform.

191
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:10,389
If you take the other view of free speech
that says,

192
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,610
"You have to make a venue where speech works,"

193
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,380
that requires having an aspiration.

194
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,660
It's not just, "Be more open and connected."

195
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:21,650
It's not just, "Talk to anyone you want to."

196
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,919
It's actually, "We're trying to build a conversation
here,

197
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,819
and if you don't look like you're building
a conversation

198
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:26,940
then you don't belong here."

199
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,009
That's a very hard kind of mental shift.

200
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:30,680
That's not necessarily a bad thing,

201
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,449
but if we're giving that much power to a private
company,

202
00:07:33,449 --> 00:00:00,000
we better hope it knows what it's doing.
