00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:14,080
CALIFORNIA HAS A NEW AD OUT.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,350
LET'S WATCH THE FIRST ONE.

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,420
DIANE, YOU'VE BEEN IN
CONGRESS FOR A QUARTER OF A

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,120
CENTURY WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE
READY FOR MEDICARE FRAUD?

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,060
WHAT JUST BE HONEST WITH THE
VOTERS AND SAY THAT YOU ARE

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,238
NEVER GOING TO BE READY
BECAUSE THAT IS NOT WHAT YOUR

8
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,679
DONORS WANT.

9
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,680
AFTER THAT TOWNHOUSE WHEN THIS
MONEY FROM HEALTHCARE

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,690
COMPANY AS WELL OUR FAMILIES ARE
SUFFERING.

11
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,970
THE PEOPLE OVERWHELMINGLY WANT
MEDICARE FOR ALL THAT THE

12
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,380
BIG PHARMA DONORS PROFIT OFF OF
SICK AMERICA.

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,390
THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS A
DEMOCRACY I'M GOING TO MAKE

14
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,289
SURE TO COUNTRY HEALTHCARE BY
FIGHTING FOR A MEDICARE

15
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:55,589
FOR ALL SYSTEM NOW.

16
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:59,870
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP
WAITING, FOR THIS NATION

17
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,969
THE PROSPEROUS PEOPLE.

18
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:09,270
YOU CAN MY FACE FOR YOU.

19
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,950
UNDERSTAND THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A
CENTER.

20
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,100
NOT FOLLOW THE MONEY.

21
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,390
DAMN.

22
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:26,530
THERE WE GO.

23
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:46,439
FEINSTEIN
HAS BEEN 

24
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,740
IN OFFICE FOR 15 YEARS.

25
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,500
SHE'S NEVER GOING TO DO MEDICARE
FOR ALL AND ALLISON HARTSON WAS

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,490
COMING WITH A 2 X 4 OVER THERE
SAYING WHILE OUR FAMILIES

27
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,579
WERE SUFFERING SHE WAS
COLLECTING CHECKS.

28
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,770
THIS IS WHY ALLISON HAS
OUTRAISED DIANE FEINSTEIN

29
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,150
AND ANOTHER PERSON IN THE RACE
COMBINED.

30
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,830
SHE HAS MORE VOLUNTEERS THAN
ANYONE ELSE IN THE RACE

31
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,290
COMBINED.

32
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,020
LET'S GO TO THAT ALLISON
HARTSON.COM/NOW.

33
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,870
IF YOU ARE IN CALIFORNIA GO
KNOCK ON DOORS, IT MAKES A

34
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,080
HUGE DIFFERENCE.

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,610
YOU CAN MAKE PHONE CALLS FOR
HER.

36
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,150
YOU CAN DO IT IN 15 SECONDS.

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,350
WE WILL HAVE THE LINKS DOWN
BELOW.

38
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:40,490
OF COURSE THOSE SMALL DOLLAR
DONATIONS MAKE ALL THE

39
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,680
DIFFERENCE.

40
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,190
DO A DONATION, SMALL DOLLAR
AMOUNT IS GREAT, AND A DONATION

41
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,950
IS GREAT SO WE CAN BEAT THOSE
CORPORATE DEMOCRATS AND GET

42
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,720
MEDICARE FOR ALL AND A REAL
PROGRESSIVE.

43
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,780
HERE COMES ALLISON.

44
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,740
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS YOU DO
WHEN YOU DON'T IT IS GIVEN THE

45
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,150
ABILITY TO RUN THAT ADD MORE IN
CALIFORNIA SO PEOPLE CAN FIND

46
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,240
OUT HOW AWFUL DIANE FEINSTEIN'S
RECORD IS.

47
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:20,050
SHE TELLS A CONSTITUENT I AM NOT
READY FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL YET.

48
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,320
THEN A WEEK LATER SHE GOES
AND COLLECTS CHECKS FROM

49
00:03:23,320 --> 00:00:00,000
HEALTHCARE INDUSTRIES AND
REPRESENTS YOUR DONORS INSTEAD.
