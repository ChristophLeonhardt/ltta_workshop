obviously very loyal and very dedicated to mr. Trump I think he's going to be not just a good president I think he's gonna be a great president fortunately mr. Trump has a significant number of people I'd like to keep myself in that little circle of extremely loyal people you'll do what it's necessary to protect him and the president the office of the presidency welcome back to am joy above all else Donald Trump Rises loyalty which is which is exactly what Michael Cohen is all about Trump's longtime fixer slash attorney who joined the Trump Organization ten years ago once said about Trump quote I'm the guy who would take a bullet for the president well that symbolic bullet has certainly arrived as Cohen finds himself in a lawsuit with a porn star that he paid off to keep quiet about her sexual encounter with Trump and under federal investigation for possible bake fraud and campaign finance violations that also means Cohen is finally in the orbit of trumps attention a place he's wanted to be for years Trump's Cohen's dream to become Trump's right-hand man is detailed in The Wall Street Journal where it's reported that after Trump headed to the White House without Michael Cohen Cohen told Trump quote boss I miss you so much I wish I was down there with you it's really hard for me to be here joining me now to discuss is the great lawrence O'Donnell host of the last word hey Lauren good morning you know Michael Cohen was named after I don't this is probably accidentally probably I was another but I think if you if your name is Cohen and and you're born around the time Michael Collins born Michael is a really big decision for a first name because America had won would you get only a couple of really famous really bad Jewish gangsters and Mickey Cohen was one of them Mickey Cohen was Bugsy Siegel's murderer guy yeah in Los Angeles he Mickey Cohen was born in Brooklyn and then grew up in Los Angeles and became a Las Vegas Los Angeles gangster thug pure bad guy and so is something I think when Michael Cohen was born was there any pause over that first name was there any pause what it seems to have done is infused young Michael Cohen with a Mickey Cohen kind of ambition yeah he wanted to grow up to be Mickey Cohen yeah so you know he went to cooley Law School and became tried to become Donald Trump's Mickey Cohen because the Wall Street Journal piece which is epic by the way I recommend everyone read it it talks about him bragging to friends sort of make himself sound like he was mobbed up even though people didn't keep him and he kind of operates like he thinks he's sort of that guy but then the way that Donald Trump treats him he's sort of more Fredo than it is anything else right it the way he treats me sort of cold this is one of the pieces from that from that Wall Street Journal article and it says after his saying he'd attend Cohen son's Bar Mitzvah in 2012 Trump was late and the blessings were delayed according to an attendee after Trump arrived he gave a speech telling guests he hadn't planned to come but he relented after Cohen had repeatedly called him his secretary and his children begging him to appear the guests laughed because everyone knew it was very realistic said no I know some of the sources in The Wall Street Journal article who I've spoken to privately about this and and so the all that character stuff I'd already heard about and but you don't have to know any of that because you just have to watch the way Donald Trump literally treats everybody so so the story is all about how brokenhearted Michael Cohen was that he wasn't the White House chief of staff right well okay now watch how Donald Trump treated the White House chief of staff good point and then watch how he treated the next White House chief his death watch how he treats you know his Secretary of State he treats them all the way Michael Cohen is described as being treated in The Wall Street Journal yeah and he's continuing to treat him you're right the same way this is a dump Trump was on Fox and Friends the sort of epic interview on Thursday and here's how he could have minimized Michael calling mr. president how much of your legal work was handled by Michael Cohen well as a percentage of my overall legal work a tiny in little fractions he represents me like with this crazy stormy Daniels deal he represented me and you know from what I see he did absolutely nothing wrong only took out supposedly a home equity loan on his own house and gave one hundred and thirty thousand dollars to stormy Daniels and saying tiny tiny little fraction my legal work means the judge now says well then that means only a tiny tiny fraction of what we seized from his house is covered by attorney-client and and listen I had a lot of fun with this interview one of the night it happened on my show I just want to for the record get this in here great credit to Steve Doocy for asking that question the the interesting thing about this interview which was very softball was even within the softball context they were asking good questions why did he take the fifth that's a good question and no one else was going to get a chance to ask that question so they had a bunch of good questions in this thing that gave us this material and what Donald Trump didn't realize is what all of his lawyers have been telling him whenever you do interviews anything public that has anything to do with any of these cases there are going to be landmines all around you right and you won't know what they are and you they don't say this part you won't know what they are because you're unbelievably stupid and you have grit gained nothing from your lifetime as a litigant as both a plaintiff and a defendant suing and being sued for fraud and being found culpable for fraud and Trump University you've learned nothing so when he said that thing about he does a tiny amount of my legal work which as far as we can tell is actually true yeah Michael Cohen's never appeared in a donald trump lawsuit ever he's never filed an appearance in court for donald trump who's been in you know court cases all his whole life what he did as everyone knows is give this incredible gift to the prosecutors and in new york city who immediately typed that quote into their communication with the judge that morning about why there really is no attorney-client privilege are not much of an attorney-client privilege to worry about yeah in these in this evidence we're looking at because his big client just said nothing yeah he's one of these big to be the other being kennedy observe you interviewed Michael have an idea live we've interviewed him a couple times on this show this little avenatti is becoming my co-host I just yeah I got a say and we don't even like you know he's not even scheduled to be on and then suddenly the stormy case horns up whether it's in the Michael Cohen context of the Donald Trump context and we call them and you know comes in one weekend yeah and Donald Trump seems to be helping his case this is avenatti on trump's Fox interview on Thursday I think the president should appear on Fox and Friends every morning that's what I think I thought it was exceptional for our case and I thought it was disastrous for him I think there's no question it implicates him and I do not believe there is any way you can reconcile what the president said on Fox and Friends with his statements on Air Force One with the prior statements of Michael Cohen those are all irreconcilable why is Donald Trump helping Michael avenatti and hurting Michael Cohen when Michael Cohen could in theory testify against him because Donald Trump does not know how to help himself he has no idea how to do that and so and because he's this blusterer you know talk addict he is addicted to hearing himself talk that that's the kind of person who's going to constantly get himself in trouble in these kinds of things and of course the White House of course after the world agreed this was a disastrous appearance by Donald Trump I mean even Fox News did not try to pretend you saw it on their faces oh my god I mean they they couldn't pretend while it was happening that this was a good thing in fact Rupert Murdoch obviously obviously called the control room and said end this before we end the Trump presidency and on Fox News because as you know I mean we know this business if you had the President on right now yeah and your director thought we're still going to the commercial someone would tell him no no we're not going to Marshall yeah and then eventually literally the presidents of networks would get involved yeah on the phone saying no no no keep this going right and so to shut down the president required Rupert Murdoch intervention which I'm sure occurred in this thing and so of course the White House and Kelly Ann Connolly have to say oh it was great yeah we're gonna do it every month that's of course their own review of how great it was you know and it's interesting because it it seems that everyone around Donald Trump including his attorneys have a really hard time managing him the people who seem to have a have an easy time managing him and who figured him out our foreign world leaders Emmanuel macron who just hand crazy handshakes have been pretends to be his best friend moon JM the president of South Korea who's I think brilliantly managing Donald Trump making it seem that he's about to win the Nobel Peace Prize for moon jae-in's work as is as is kim jong everyone every foreign leader knows it I mean it just couldn't be more obvious all you do is flatter and that's all you have to do and then you get whatever you want and and and Putin taught this to the world yeah because Putin at a certain point early in the campaign said something that Donald Trump took to be admirable about him is smart or some kind of thing like that and Donald Trump ran with it and they and they everyone saw oh okay so this is how you do it now they hoped that he wouldn't become president the United States but now you're the president of France you are stuck with this guy right you are trying to hold the Iran deal together because you care about the world and you care about world peace and oh by the way the guy who destroys the Iran deal does not get a Nobel Peace Prize okay that let's just put that the question and and so I watch McCrone and I just think the world is lucky that there are adults like that who do not indulge in their personal feelings for what they are experience experiencing of the person donald trump and they continue to conduct themselves and do their jobs the right way by the way it's good that the united states senate has those people too and that the House of Representatives has those people and in both parties who continue to go forward and realize he's the president the United States yes I'm gonna go to the meeting about guns in the White House because there's a billionth of 1% chance that something might come of that you never liked Democratic senators got criticized for going into that White House yeah to talk to this president about guns they were doing exactly the same thing that a Mary Emmanuel macron was doing exactly the same thing with the same kind of Hope hammock Ron hopes something might happen he knows the likelihood is that the madman will choose the mad thing yeah and Chuck and Nancy as Donald Trump was calling you know congresswoman nancy pelosi and congressman and Senator Chuck Schumer they played the same sort of moon jae-in macron game with him where they seem to be his friends I have to show you this this piece of tape Lawrence because this is how Donald Trump responds to praise as if there's a there's a visceral physical response to praise into the possibility of topping Barack Obama or getting prizes this is it and this is him talking about the Korea summit that's very nice thank you that's where Nobel I just want to get the job done no no no he doesn't just give it heat that is what he needs that adulation is the need is that the way to manage Donald Trump I personally will nominate him for Nobel Prize if he preserves the Iran deal and if Iran if and Korea is denuclearized if both of those things happen I will nominate him for Nobel price I will not nominate him for the Nobel Prize if he destroys the Iran deal yeah I will if they have an opposite prize he will get that absolutely okay I have to do a quick pivot here because everyone is talking about the White House Correspondents Dinner I know you know I just watched it after the fact but here is the really important and pointed criticism by comedian Michelle wolf of our profession take a listen you guys are obsessed with Trump did you use to date him because you pretend like you hate him but I think you love him I think what no one in this room wants to admit is that Trump has helped all of you he couldn't so steaks or vodka or water or college or ties or Eric but he has helped you he's helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV you helped create this monster and now you're profiting off of him it's fair Oh the best and most important line of the night you know a lot of the rest of it is is jokes and and some of it has has important some of it doesn't that was especially when it's a it's a dinner that is about the press and it's about the press celebrating itself it's about the press congratulating itself particularly the White House press corps congratulating itself which I have to say if you were to look at the history of the White House press corps it has less to congratulate itself for now than ever because it subjects itself to these ridiculous White House press briefings that are the stuff out of a totalitarian regime with a ridiculous person standing up there no matter who it is the woman or the man or the junior man it doesn't matter who it is who's standing up there lying no stop through every moment of it and that's that's what the White House press corps function has become to become the the props in that that kind of totalitarian regimes theater and so there's less to celebrate the network I think they have to reconsider the entire thing is there something going on here that is worth celebrating is there sand and if and by the way there's a lot of good in that dinner that no one ever pays attention dollars and that I certainly didn't pay attention to last night because I had I had no interested at all and then I saw on Twitter that the jokes were controversial so okay so I went on c-span org and I watched just the comedian yeah and and you know and and but there's all these journalism awards to young people that are important that they're doing in that event but they would need a room just a little bigger than this yeah for the good stuff they do and the rest of it is pure show business they've created a show business event they try to get 2,000 people into a hotel ballroom they use movie stars to do that when they could they can't do that anymore because Hollywood doesn't care about this event anymore because of Trump and so they created the White House Correspondents Association created a show business event they cannot complain when they get show business at the show business event yeah and the show business event has become modeled on the show business roast if they get roasted they cannot complain about that there you go I know how to get Trump to go next year Kanye's performing that's how you get in there lawrence O'Donnell the great lawrence O'Donnell you guys already watched the last word are you better it's a 10 p.m. on my 10 p.m. Monday through Friday I already know that
