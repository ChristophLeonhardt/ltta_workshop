ENJOYED THE DAY OFF FOR CLBLDZ.

-- COLUMBUS DAY.

6
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:33,383
SOME WANT IT CALLED INDIGENOUS

00:00:33,384 --> 00:00:35,218
PEOPLE DAY.

8
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,921
COLUMBUS, OHIO, IS DITCHING

THE AUTHOR OF "ERASING AMERICA"

00:00:46,864 --> 00:00:48,799
JOINS US TONIGHT.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,568
THIS IS PART OF A LARGER TREND

14
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:53,437
YOU WRITE ABOUT IN YOUR BOOK

15
00:00:53,438 --> 00:00:55,572
WHICH I HOPE OUR VIEWERS READ.

16
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:56,707
TELL US WHAT THAT TREND IS.

17
00:00:56,708 --> 00:01:02,079
>> WELL, THE TREND IS TO MAKE US

18
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,381
ALL FEEL ASHAMED TO BE AMERICANS

19
00:01:04,382 --> 00:01:06,516
AND LOOK AT EVERY ASPECT OF THE

20
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:09,486
AMERICAN STORY AND SAY THE

21
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:10,754
FOUNDERS WAS BAD AND THE

22
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:11,888
CONSTITUTION IS RACIST.

23
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:15,158
WHAT BETTER PLACE TO START THAN

24
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,727
WITH CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS?

25
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:19,229
HE WAS PATIENT ZERO OF THE

26
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,431
EUROPEAN INVASION OF AMERICA.

27
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:23,166
>> Tucker: I COULD NOT AGREE

28
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:23,967
WITH YOU MORE.

29
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,702
WHAT IS THE POINT OF THAT?

30
00:01:25,703 --> 00:01:28,271
WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO DO THAT?

31
00:01:28,272 --> 00:01:30,674
>> WELL, THE POINT IS IF WE FEEL

32
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,509
BAD ABOUT OUR COUNTRY AND ABOUT

33
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,980
THE PAST, THEY CAN REWRITE ANY

34
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:39,616
FUTURE THEY WANT.

35
00:01:39,617 --> 00:01:43,353
PROGRESSIVES WANT TO TURN THE

36
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:46,023
UNITED STATES INTO A SOCIALIST

37
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:46,356
COUNTRY.

38
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:47,090
IF YOU SAY EVERYTHING IN THE

39
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:50,160
PAST IS BAD, THEY CAN COME UP

40
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,294
WITH A FUTURE THAT FITS WHATEVER

41
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:53,530
THEY WANT TO MAKE IT.

42
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:55,732
>> Tucker: THEY ARE TELLING THE

43
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:58,969
REST OF US YOU DON'T HAVE THE

44
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,104
RIGHT TO DEFEND YOURSELF AGAINST

45
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:02,239
OUR ASSAULTS?

46
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,540
>> OH, DEFINITELY.

47
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,510
IT'S ABOUT SHAME AND BLAME.

48
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:08,211
THE ASSAULT ON COLUMBUS.

49
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,782
AS A BUCKEYE I AM SAID ABOUT

50
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,316
COLUMBUS, OHIO, DITCHING THE

51
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:13,650
HOLIDAY.

52
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:16,620
I THINK THEY SHOULD CHANGE THE

53
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:18,321
NAME OF THE CITY.

54
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:22,025
>> Tucker: I AGREE TO INDIGENOUS

55
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:22,359
CITIES.

56
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,260
>> [LAUGHING].

57
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:27,597
OR VIRTUE-VILLE.

58
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:28,699
>> Tucker: [LAUGHING].

59
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,100
OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON

60
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:32,402
IN ACADEMIA FOR SOMETIME.

61
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,671
IT SEEMS TO HAVE SPREAD TO

62
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:37,107
COLUMBUS, OHIO, WHICH IS A GREAT

63
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:40,310
TOWN FILLED WITH NORMAL PEOPLE.

64
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:43,346
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S BEEN

65
00:02:43,347 --> 00:02:44,781
INSINUATED INTO THE AMERICAN

66
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:47,317
EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR DECADES.

67
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:51,755
STARTING IN THE 1970s, WE HAD

68
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:52,856
REVISIONISM IN AMERICAN HISTORY

69
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:54,291
BOOKS.

70
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:59,129
WITH COLUMBUS, HE STARTS CHAPTER

71
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,066
1 IN THE REVISIONIST HISTORY OF

72
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:03,433
AMERICA.

73
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,268
PEOPLE SAY COLUMBUS IS A BAD

74
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:05,635
GUY.

75
00:03:05,636 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Tucker: UNBELIEVABLE.
