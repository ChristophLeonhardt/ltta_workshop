>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE A
STUPID COUNTRY ANYMORE.
WE'VE STOPPED IT.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE.
AND YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU
WANT, BUT I THINK BORDER
SECURITY AND SECURITY
GENERAL IS A GREAT ISSUE FOR
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
BRIAN: YOU KNOW WHAT?
I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S BEYOND
REPUBLICANS.
I THINK THE AVERAGE AMERICAN
WANTS BORDER SECURITY.
I THINK THAT'S THE MOST
CONFUSING ISSUE ON
DEMOCRATS.
I THINK EVERYBODY REALLY
WANTS SOME SECURITY ON THE
SOUTHERN BORDER.
THEY ARE CRAZY TO FIGHT THE
PRESIDENT ON THE BORDER.
AINSLEY: YOU KEPT SAYING THE
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS
DON'T WANT SANCTUARY CITIES
AND THEN ALL THESE CITIES
STARTED TO VOTE AGAINST IT
LET'S BRING IN TOMI LAHREN
WHO LIVES IN CALIFORNIA.
SHE IS A FOX NEWS
CONTRIBUTOR AND CAN WEIGH IN
ON THIS.
WHY IS BORDER SECURITY SO
IMPORTANT TO THE FOLKS WHO
DO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA.
THOSE WHO SUPPORT THE
PRESIDENT?
>> WELL, CALIFORNIANS AND
OTHER BORDER STATES WE
UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE THE
MOST VULNERABLE WHEN IT
COMES TO THESE ISSUES.
BUT IT'S NOT JUST US.
WE JUST DEAL WITH THE
PROBLEM MORE CLOSE TO HOME.
THIS IS AN AMERICAN ISSUE.
AS BRIAN SAID, WHEN I HEAR
OUR PRESIDENT DOUBLE DOWN ON
BORDER SECURITY, OF COURSE
THAT'S GOING TO BE A WINNING
AGENDA ITEM FOR THIS
PRESIDENT AND THOSE WHO
CHOOSE TO SUPPORT BORDER
SECURITY.
WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO ASK
IS WHY ARE THE DEMOCRATS SO
AGAINST IT WHY DO THE
DEMOCRATS NOT BELIEVE IN THE
INTEGRITY OF OUR BORDERS,
OUR LAWS AND PROTECTING THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE?
THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT
NEEDS TO BE ASKED.
NOT WHY IS TRUMP DOUBLING
DOWN.
OF COURSE THIS PRESIDENT IS
DOUBLING DOWN THIS PRESIDENT
BELIEVES IN A SECURE BORDER.
BRIAN: THERE IS A PUSH WITH
NATURE CORY GARDNER AND
MODERATES IN THE HOUSE TO
GET SOMETHING DONE ON DACA
BEFORE MID TERMS COME.
GO WITH THE MID TERMS WHAT
THEY HAVE DONE OR HAVEN'T
DONE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
THAT?
THE PRESIDENT MAY BE GOING
THERE AND SAYING GIVING ME
THE 25 BILLION FOR THE WALL
I WILL GIVE YOU DACA AND GO
BACK FOR CHAIN MIGRATION?
GO BACK FOR THE LOTTERY?
DO YOU THINK THAT BENEFITS
HIM OR US?
>> I THINK THIS PRESIDENT
HAS SAID MULTIPLE TIMES HE
IS WILLING TO COMPROMISE.
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT NOT
ONLY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT
FOR THE AMERICANS THAT VOTED
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAUSE
OF HIS PROMISE TO BUILD THE
WALL IS THAT BEFORE WE START
DEALING WITH THOSE THAT ARE
ALREADY HERE ILLEGALLY THAT
THAT HAS TO BE NUMBER ONE.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE TO
TRUST THAT FIRST AND THEN WE
CAN HAVE A BIGGER
CONVERSATION ABOUT
IMMIGRATION REFORM.
I THINK TO DO IT PETE MEAL,
I
PIECEMEALIS A MISTAKE.
AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL STAND
BEHIND HIM.
BRIAN: WHICH MEANS NOTHING
GETS DONE THOUGH.
>> IT MIGHT MEAN THAT
NOTHING GETS DONE
IMMEDIATELY.
BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS
GOING TO BE PRESSURE ON THE
REPUBLICANS AND EACH ON THE
DEMOCRATS TO DO SOMETHING.
AND NOT JUST PIECE BY PIECE
BUT HAVE REAL, TRUE
IMMIGRATION REFORM FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME.
THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE WANT.
US AS VOTERS, WE HAVE TO
MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKE THAT
CLEAR.
AND WE VOTE ON ISSUE THAT.
PETE: DEMOCRATS IN RESISTING
THIS PRESIDENT ON THE WALL
HAVE TRIED TO CHARACTERIZE
HIS POLICIES AS INHUMANE
WHEN A PHOTO SURFACED OF
CAGED MY GRANTS A COUPLE
DAYS AGO.
THEY WENT OVER THE EDGE.
JOHN FAVREAU FORMER SPEECH
WRITER FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA
TWEETED THIS IS HAPPENING
RIGHT NOW AND THE ONLY
DEBATE THAT MATTERS IS HOW
WE FORCE OUR GOVERNMENT TO
GET THESE KIDS BACK TO THEIR
FAMILIES AS FAST AS HUMANLY
POSSIBLE.
TURNS OUT OOPS THESE PHOTOS
ARE FROM 2014 WHEN BARACK
OBAMA WAS PRESIDENT.
>> TURNS OUT MANY ON THE
OTHER SIDE ARE NOT CONCERNED
WITH THE TRUTH SO LONG AS
THEY CAN ATTACK PRESIDENT
TRUMP.
THIS WAS A GREAT MISSTEP ON
THEIR PART.
AND IT JUST GOES TO SHOW
THAT THE LEVEL OF PARTISAN
POLITICS IN THIS COUNTRY HAS
REACHED SUCH ANTICS STREAM
LEVEL THAT THE TRUTH REALLY
DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.
HAVE YOU AN IMAGE, YOU
CIRCULATE IT AND WHAT THE
PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLS FAKE
NEWS IT LOOKS PRETTY BAD FOR
THEM.
MOVING FORWARD I HOPE THAT
AS DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
WE CAN DO WHAT'S RIGHT AND
STAND FOR OUR BELIEFS AND
NOT JUST PICK THE SIDE OF
WHO WE VOTED FOR OR OUR
PARTISAN LINE.
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS COUNTRY
IS BASED ON.
AINSLEY: MAINSTREAM MEDIA
HEARD THIS STORY OF HUSBAND
DEPORTED BACK TO MEXICO.
MAINSTREAM MEDIA RUNS WITH
IT AND SAYS FAMILY BROKEN
UP.
HUSBAND SENT BACK TO MEXICO.
THIS IS INHUMANE.
THIS IS WRONG.
LISTEN TO THE WIFE BEING
INTERVIEWED AND I DON'T
THINK MAINSTREAM MEDIA WAS
EXPECTING HOW CALM SHE WAS
AND HER LACK OF ANIMOSITY.
LISTEN.
>> I AM NOT UPSET AT OUR
GOVERNMENT DUE TO THE FACT
THAT I AM A U.S. CITIZEN AND
THAT OUR LAWS COME FIRST.
OUR LAWS ARE JUST BROKEN AND
NEED TO BE FIXED.
BUT, I CAN'T BE MAD AT TRUMP
FOR DOING HIS JOB BECAUSE
THAT IS HIS JOB TO PROTECT
US AS U.S. CITIZENS FROM
CRIMINALS.
BRIAN: OOPS.
I NEVER EXPECTED THAT
ANSWER.
IF YOU ARE ON CNN YOU DON'T
EXPECT THAT ANSWER, DO YOU?
>> OF COURSE YOU DON'T.
THIS JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT
LEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND EVEN
FAMILY MEMBERS OF IMMIGRANTS
EXPECT BORDER SECURITY THERE
IS A REASON PEOPLE COME TO
THIS COUNTRY AND WIN THE
AMERICAN DREAM.
IT'S FOR THE SAFETY WE
PROMISE OUR CITIZENS.
SO LEGAL IMMIGRANTS LOOK AT
OUR BORDER AND THEY WANT IT
TO BE SECURE AS WELL.
THAT'S WHY THEY LIVE IN THIS
COUNTRY IN PART SO THEY CAN
BE SAFE AND SECURE.
THERE IS NOT DOESN'T BELIEVE
WE NEED IMMIGRATION REFORM.
IT'S HARD TO SEE FAMILIES
BROKEN UP LIKE THIS.
THE FACT THAT SHE
APPRECIATES OUR COUNTRY AND
RULE OF LAW SPEAKS A LOT TO
THE CHARACTER OF THIS
PERSON.
BRIAN: IT'S AMAZING, THEY
SAY 70 PERCENT OF
IMMIGRATION REFORM WE ALL
AGREE ON.
30% WITH THE BORDER WALL AND
DACA AND THE ILLEGALS HERE
ALREADY WHICH STOPS THE
WHOLE PROCESS.
KEEP THE COUPLES TOGETHER
THOSE PEOPLE WHO MARRY
SOMEBODY FROM ANOTHER
COUNTRY.
ALL THAT STUFF JUST TAKES
TOO LONG AND IS TOO COSTLY.
THE LINE IS TOO LONG FOR
PEOPLE TO DO IT LEGALLY.
BUT WE ALL GET HUNG UP ON
