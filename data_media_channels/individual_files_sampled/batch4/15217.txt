hey folks remember this classic rock song from Queen alas what the hell was the late Freddie Mercury thinking when he recorded that insensitive tuned because in 2018 an increasing number of schools are now banning students from having best friends back in grade 8 when I was attending McDonald Drive junior high school in st. John's Newfoundland Darryl was my best friend don't get me wrong we weren't all that close in fact we had nothing in common it's just that we walked home from school the same way each day typically in silence but Darryl was one of the few kids that MacDonald Drive who didn't beat me up or stick gum in my hair you see given that I was a Toronto transplant and that I talked funny was just to say I pronounced boy as boy and not as bi well the born-and-bred Newfoundlanders would take out their hatred of Hogtown on yours truly except for Daryl who was merely indifferent or perhaps he just silently despised me in any event Daryl never acted on his contempt by physically kicking my four one six area code arse to the curb so by default Darryl was indeed my best friend even if he didn't know it but good thing that this friendship sprouted circa 1976 and not today because at certain schools best friends much like peanut products are banned from campus indeed in a recent Metro story it's noted that the term best friend is not allowed in some schools anymore because such terminology lacks inclusivity oh that's a laugh of course the concept of a best friend lacks inclusivity that's the bloody point look I'd like to eat a lot of fruit but cherries are my favorite am I supposed to pretend I like black berries as much as cherries in the name of being inclusive when it comes to the fruit aficionado community yet this is how a growing number of schools are rolling children are encouraged to have lots of good friends but are discouraged from having any best friends in fact some schools have actually forbidden that term to be uttered and I'd love to see how they enforce that Orwellian directive by the way it should be noted that while certain edge across in child psychologists are in favor banning best friends apparently this isn't a popular position in the real world as of now 91 percent of metro readers polled said they were opposed to best friend bans but hey what do we the great unwashed masses know about raising our kids and what you may ask can the school system do for non-core when it comes to yet more social engineering well how about this little doozy earlier this month at a Valentine's Day dance at the Kane's Vil elementary school in Utah students were told they could not say no if another student were to ask them to dance again in the name of inclusivity and protecting kids feelings from being crushed by rejection if one student asked another to dance the answer had to be yes welcome the camp bubble wrap yet talk about mixed messages for decades we've been told that a woman has the right to choose we've also been told that nausea that no means no G has the me - times up movement already come to a grinding halt given that the girls attending Kingsville Elementary are forbidden to choose or to actually say no pass the popcorn folks I think we're now witnessing a circus sideshow in which the progressives are cannibalizing themselves for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks download the new rebel media app from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store to take the rebel with you wherever you go you
