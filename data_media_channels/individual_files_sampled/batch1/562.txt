goofy rebels in Yemen's say they've built their own surface-to-air missile it comes days after Saudi Arabia said that it intercepted a ballistic missile that was fired towards its territory so is there an end game to this near three-year conflict this is inside story hello welcome to the program I'm Adrienne Finnegan it's a new year but the same old story in Yemen nearly three years on since the saudi-led coalition began its military campaign more people are dying at least 11 were killed in a Saudi airstrike on Wednesday that targeted a market in lowland Sadr province that region is a stronghold of Houthi rebels who've been in control of much of the country since 2015 well the fighting has killed at least 10,000 people and displaced millions more just this week Houthi rebels announced that they've built a new locally designed missile to fight against the saudi-led coalition and now the rebels are threatening to block the Red Sea shipping lanes if the coalition keeps pushing towards the western city of Hadi de which the Houthis control the UN is called Yemen the world's worst humanitarian crisis with 8 million people on the brink of famine thousands of others are suffering from malnutrition and disease including cholera but on Tuesday the World Health Organization said that more than 500 people have been infected with diphtheria 48 of them have died since the outbreak began in August so let's bring in our guests in Yemen's capital sana we're joined by Hakim Alma smari editor-in-chief of the Yemen Post Nabil curry is the former deputy chief of mission with the US Embassy in Yemen he joins us from Washington DC and finally from London Andreas Craig regional defense and security specialist and assistant professor with King's College London welcome to you gentlemen addressed let's start with you in December there was something like a 67 percent rise in the number of bombing raids carried out by the coalition recent reports would have us believe that the saudi-led coalition has now begun to make progress on the ground against Houthi rebels is that indeed the case is the coalition now beginning to win this war no we're far away from it unfortunately and this conflict is you know going into its third year and going actually and it's almost into its fourth year I mean it this has been going on it's a tit-for-tat with the shifting alliances on the ground where international backing particularly from the UAE in Saudi Arabia are playing one side of the contrary gainst the other and you know we have to make sure to say that there is no binary side to this cotton this is not a binary conflict this is not one side versus the other side this is a multipolar conflict where different people are shifting around all the time so it you know there are different battlefields with different actors in different spaces around the country and yes on some of these fronds they are sometimes some progress is made on other fronts progress is not made the problem generally is with this air power let operation is that targeting is very poor there's very poor intelligence on the ground in determining where the targets are and who you want to target if you actually look at the numbers two-thirds of all of these airstrikes that been conducted by the saudi-led coalition have actually missed their target or hit civilian targets and I would suspect that the saudi-led coalition didn't want to actually hit their civilian targets but they did so it's from an air power point of view it's been very unsuccessful actually to make to enable people on the ground because air power is always there to support forces on the ground and the forces on the ground have shifted and there the the the previous allies that the UAE and Saudi were supporting have not made the progress then they thought they could get saleh and his men on the side to use them as their ground forces then he was killed and the whole his own party is dissolving and backed up bogged down in a fight with the Houthis in the north the southern coalition which is led by the UAE themselves are trying to move from ties towards closer towards who data trying to take the port but here also I mean they've been region a very local progress has been made on the tactical level the issue though is that on the strategic level the military wing the air power wing of this Saudi coalition doesn't have the punch because it can't really achieve what a Ground Force actually has to achieve if you don't have a capable ground force to actually sees an old territory there's nothing that airpower can do particularly when our power targeting is so poorly done Nabil curry what do you make of that is this conflict any closer to ending anytime soon or is it completely intractable a quagmire it's a relative question by killing Ali Abdullah Saleh the Houthis have definitely shot themselves in the foot in a big way weakening themselves politically by losing most of the X ruling party the GPC and militarily by losing at least half of the armed forces that were loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh now with the reappearance of Tariq Saleh the nephew of the former president inside Yemen and apparently working with Ali Mohsen al-ahmar and now the the coalition led by Saudi Arabia is in a much stronger position and making moves towards pedido and towards breaking the Houthi siege around ties if the if the Houthis lose later entires they've essentially lost the war now the question is if you are trying to achieve a total defeat of the whole thing's how long would this take and what price and here is the problem is that even with the loss of Ferdinand Carnes the houthis would still be strong in sana and further north in sodom also on the ground which is where it matters the most the coalition against them is divided is working at cross-purposes sometimes and therefore they would not be able to stabilize any territory recovered from the Houthis which means a prolonged war at one level or another the sad part of this is that at some point this war has to end in a political agreement so what would be the point of thousands upon thousands more casualties if you could strike a bargain right now and and here's the sad part is that I don't think they're about to strike a bargain the Houthis are not politically astute in fact they were quite stupid and kicked in killing Saleh and it seems Saudi Arabia under its new leader is intent on a complete military victory so I don't see anything in the year ahead 2018 other than more fighting more casualties and more suffering by the Yemeni people Andres so if there was a serious international effort to end this conflict could it actually be done Yemen is not Syria it's not Libya I suppose you could draw parallels with Afghanistan or could you can a comprehensive peace deal ever be reached in Yemen given the tribal nature of much of its society and will it just continued to experience ongoing strife of some sort going into the future that just being the very nature of Yemen exactly it's the very nature of Yemen we have to understand that Yemen has never been a unitary nation-state it's never really applied to the Western idea of behaving territoriality in serenity there are multiple conflicts that were always simmering with in Yemen and these multiple conflicts all need to be somewhat addressed under Ali Abdullah Saleh he was able to kind of keep a lid on most of it by playing one side against the other but you know we have over the last couple of years always looked at it from a binary point of view the media has the media has either portrayed the Houthis as the evil and then the hardy government as the good government so it's like black and white but also even the UN has looked at it in a binary way as looked as the Union as the Houthi Saleh coalition versus the south and those the UAE Saudi coalition and bringing those two sides together in reality I mean especially since the Arab Spring and since Ali Abdullah Saleh has been ousted and then returned I mean this conflict this country has really RuPt it into multiple conflicts so any comprehensive solution has to be an inclusive one one where all the different parties have to come to the table and the problem with the UN approach is that a lot of the other very important players on the ground have not been included they're not even part of the approach that the UN is taking or the international community is taking so really what is needed then is something similar to the 2012 national dialogue which has to be inclusive and it has to be that inclusive to also include the Houthis and I could think that was part of the problem that the Houthis were somewhat alienated into leaving the National Dialogue and I think now the UAE Saudi coalition they seem to think that a solution could be found even with Allah slaw which the UAE opposed initially because they are affiliated or used to be affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood but they don't want to talk to the Houthis and the thing with the Houthis is and that's why I think there is a great comparison to be done here with Afghanistan is that they are very much a mountainous people who know how to operate as a guerrilla insurgency fourth force within a certain environment what they are not good at is politics they're not good at actual engagement and and reaching out also because they have been alienated multiple times before by various coalition's and by LNA and further by not including them in the process you're actually exacerbating the problem at the moment I think the who these think that they can still win in the north although they have been politically politically weakened and somewhat militarily we could they can fight another day because they could just retreat to the northwestern part of Yemen where they come from where they originated they don't have the ambition to rule all over Yemen and a comprehensive solution for Yemen means we need to address all these other conflicts that are going on in the Northeast that are going on in the south and then are going on in the Hydra mode in the East so I think we're looking at at least four or five different conflicts with different tribal factions and that can be brought together so the new balance means all these parties have to be included nabil Korea the UN and international powers being too simplistic in their approach to finding peace in Yemen this binary approach that we heard about are they to what extent are they are they talking to the wrong people in their attempt to bring peace to Yemen I think both you and diplomacy as well as United States diplomacy both have been very limited in terms of the people they've approached American diplomacy has practically been missing the UN unfortunately right now other than limiting itself to the people it's talking to also is not moving with good political skills I think right now there are two possible approaches to peace one is going back to the UN to the Security Council specifically to produce a new resolution that would hopefully have unanimity within the council and would start fresh with a new approach given that formal resolution to two one six is now pretty much obsolete failing a consensus at the Security Council and I think it's very hard to achieve that consensus the Yemeni parties need to forget about the region forget about the United Nations and world's peace among one another for that to happen you need a national leader of stature a strong figure who could inspire the Yemeni people inspire all the a manufacturing including the Houthis to bring them together and say let's hammer out an agreement if the Yemenis agree with one another no power outside can destroy that no power outside can continue the war if they themselves agree with one another unfortunately right now the Houthis are not showing that kind of political skill or leadership to inspire the country they failed miserably as as Hakeem said they they're a good guerrilla movement but they're not good at ruling with the death of Saleh you know with all that one can say for him or against them he was a very strong leader a national figure there's no one else right now with that kind of stature paddy is certainly not the person to do it so again I'm not optimistic but the wild wait for a Nelson Mandela of Yemen to appear I'm afraid we're just gonna see more misery for the year ahead well let's hear from Sanaa Hakim are you optimistic or pessimistic about finding a solution in the in the near term to this this conflict where does the blame for the continuation of it lie with the Houthis the saudi-led coalition Iran the u.s. the UK who all sides are to blame all sides are trying to flex their muscles in the war and not on the political dialogue or trying to reach a solution it's very sad to see that in sana right now basically no worry if this war continues for months and months or even longer than that they feel that they're they are powerful they are stronger than they were last year but this is not the case because after death expressing sorrow it's a different story over the last couple weeks we we visited numerous of the GPC officials to their houses try to join them with the who the officials trying to put them back on their feet they have to be involved in this political solution in the circle itself without the GPC the booth is no chance I don't see any hope in a peaceful resolution being reached without the DPC standing again on their feet putting the sufferings behind and taking lead in the political table this is Google take time as of now sadly unfortunately most of the GPC officials these ala party officials are under house arrest they do move but in their houses there are numerous with the Intel or officials who are with them all day so they need to restore their power in order to this move a wheel to move they have the experience they have the political experience the negotiation experience unlike the Houthis who are mainly focused on military activities and gathering intelligence so the only way I see that the political wheel will be moving is that the GPC starts standing again on their feet and the UN have a strong role then we said that over the last year or so last week the first visit of a UN official over the last 10 months alone so it completes stalemate by the UN side and lack of cooperation from both the saudi-led coalition and the Houthis here in San our so how can you talk about the Houthis you talk about the Houthis lack of political experience there's evidence to suggest that the key political players in Yemen are benefiting from the war economy it's not exactly in the Houthis interests to bring this conflict to a close is it some way or the other agree with that because right now they are in control and entirely in areas they control there are no rights given to the citizens when it comes to salaries electricity etc they have no intention of handing over salaries and if they do one month a year so they have no side that's pushing them to enforce to give the the rights of the people under their control so this gives the Houthis more power internally but locally and among the people generally their repetition is not doing well most of the people in sin are not allied with them but because of fear of aggression or fear of having problems with their duties they stay quiet or ignore any complication to them but again it's not about the Houthis is not about the DPC party or the saudi-led coalition allies it's about how to end this war as soon as possible to save the millions of lives who are suffering and if the UN international community and the world powers do not interfere politically then this war can take a very long time to solve and as of now over the last 18 months no side has gained ground on the ground but it's early each side has gained a couple of kilometers here and there but in general there has been no side gaining ground in either way so the only way to reach a solution is politically and through dialogue Andres Craig you were talking about the shifting sands in Yemen to what extent is time of the essence not only to bring about an end to the suffering but but given the ever-changing alliances on the ground is there a danger that the situation could simply become too complex to solve Yemen has always been complex obviously in - I completely agree whether the previous speakers said I mean the problem in Yemen is that we have an international it's it's a it's a proxy war whereby different international powers have their stakes in a conflict which essentially was a Yemeni conflict but the problem is that any weakness that Yemenis show or a different party show the more divided the Yemenis are the more they invite people to interfere from outside and I think that is pretty much the the key problem here the problem is that yes the the Emiratis have their own policy towards the South of Yemen the Saudis have their own policy towards the north of Yemen at least they pretend to have an objective to be achieved the GCC as as such doesn't exist anymore and there is no command GCC approach there is no and there are many other parties that are not represented by internationals the problem is also the absence of US leadership more than that even the US administration the Trump tration seems to be backing the saudi-led coalition giving them a blanket check to do whatever they deem necessary without actually trying to mediate so you have a multitude of different actors trying to thrive of what's going on domestically and then obviously domestically you have local order you don't have a yemeni order there is no such thing as a very many nation but there is a local order that somewhat is is keeping the country going but at a very very low level so I mean until people come to realization that there is nothing further to be gained from military action and I think the Houthis are still not at a point where they think they can they have nothing more to gain until that point fighting will continue so what the internet community should do is really address the nation states who are involved in it and that is in Iran and that is Saudi Arabia in the UAE and to a lesser extent also the United States they need to sit together and try to find a solution in order to enable those people on the ground to make concessions if you keep on giving money if you keep on weaponizing if you keep the military wing going I do think that parties on the ground have no incentive to actually sit down and talk to one another and actually that will be more dividing but ever longer the war exists the more dividing it will get the bakery do you agree with that should external actors who have interests in in Yemen should they be involved in in peace talks would any attempt to ignore them be successful well I mean obviously the ideal thing would be for international actors to put diplomacy first and to put peace first and to push very hard to make that happen the two parties that could do that are the United States and Saudi Arabia but the reality is that neither Saudi Arabia nor the u.s. seems to be interested in doing that the u.s. keeps supplying arms to the saudi-led coalition the Saudis keep pushing for a total victory and some people inside Yemen are supporting that I the UN has been flailing about without good leadership and good skills so as a result I don't think there's any hope of internationally reaching a solution that way that's why I say perhaps the burden should be on the Yemenis it is difficult to ignore foreign powers regional especially because they have so much vested interest but then peace is never easy the main thing is to get some sense of national unity going I'm sorry may be able to interrupt you hey Keene Alice Murray we're almost out of time and what do you make of that where does the key to solving the intractable problem that is Yemen lie what's it gonna take to get this war to end this as it was described by the UN's humanitarian coordinator for Yemen as an absurd war it's really complicated but and the problem is that most of the people or decides who are involved when right now in the mpany solution or a fire I'm not the winner or don't understand Yemen in general they have to understand Yemen to reach a solution now be my employee well the sheriff he tried his best he he gave our efforts but it seemed that he didn't understand the sides of him in the history of Yemen the side wants how the complications live uh Navid was here many years ago during the ex-presidents time and he knows he knows how how complicated it is so involving experts who know yet involving experts who know how to reach a solution who know the people on the ground it's not enough to talk from outside or talk to the officials you have to know on the ground it's happening and know how to meet a solution know the power makers on the ground the tribal leaders the political officials who are not in the design room now but they have a lot of influence but it could be a many as well we're now residing in Cairo etc so these sides who are respected by all the political parties India and whether the Saudi Airlines by the the Houthi coalition a clear being sidelined so these people should be given more power more influence along with the UN try to help reach a solution rather just focusing on the I'm gonna charity and having just UN statements we wonder so I came we're out of time many thanks indeed gentlemen for taking part in today's discussion Hakim Alma's Mary Nabil Curie and andreas Krieg thank you for watching don't forget
