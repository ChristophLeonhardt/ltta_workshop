first of all I have an announcement that's always fun second of all we're doing a brief drive so what is this well some of you guys already know membership and you know how the whole show works we got some of you might just see it on YouTube or Facebook or Hulu and all these different platforms that were on you might see one clip at a time but you know the show is 6 to 8 p.m. Eastern live every day two y-t-dot-com slash live and that's okay you don't have to catch it live you can catch the Young Turks and all of our shows if you remember so that's T y-t-dot-com slash join to become a member but what we're kicking off today is a drive to get to a hundred thousand members now we're gonna do some things that are extraordinary here and very out of the ordinary we're gonna have radical transparency we're gonna actually show you how many members we have yes now the reason why I say that Edward gives it almost no one in the industry does that we're gonna show it to you down to the person down to the actual account and we're gonna keep on showing it to you and then but we're also gonna tell you that our goal is impossible but we have done the impossible a number of times so I believe in you guys I believe in us and everybody that works here that we can get there so T y-t-dot-com /join do we have the thermometer can I see that so the campaign is B on the left side of history I'm gonna explain why in a second the number of paying subscribers we have right now is twenty-seven thousand six hundred and sixty-one as we go live on air now we are going to try to reach a hundred thousand by the end of the year well if you do the math on that that is extraordinarily difficult okay but I believe in all of us like I said we're not the Young Turks you're the Young Turks and so what what do you get if you've never heard of it it's basically like a progressive Netflix I'm gonna get into a little bit more detail in a minute about what you get for it and but what are we doing in the membership drive we're keep bringing you different videos about progressive positions and defending progressive positions and also going on the offense so whenever there's misinformation there every once in a while we will release a video that is specifically designed and it's tightly produced to say that you can share with your aunts uncles neighbors and cetera hey Medicare for all you hear on CNN or Fox News that it's expensive now let me show you what the reality is and how much it saves the country and on and on for all the progressive positions why higher wages for the average American makes sense and guys overall 2020 is coming and and the progressive wing of the Democratic Party must be defended and we are the ones that are going to do that defense and offense by the way so one of the things that stood out to me quite a bit since Trump's election especially is even though you have news outlets who you know claim to be the resistance against Trump every single news outlet that I've personally come across is afraid to be progressive to promote progressive ideas to to share what they genuinely think if they are progressives progressive voices especially when it comes to some of these justice Democrat candidates have been silenced have been censored in the media and we've been the only ones who have very aggressively endorsed progressive candidates and we do it in a way where we show that we're unafraid to share who we really are with our audience now at the same time in order for us to thrive and continue doing that and in order to have an even louder message we need to remain independent and the best way to do that is to rely on you guys I don't want to rely on outside funders I want to rely on our members period you guys are the ones who get to control the message and you believe in a progressive message which is why we want you guys to have more of a voice in what we do yeah so let me just add one quick thing to that that's really important look we then become Iraq and we become an immovable object if we're dependent on you guys alone Thomas Jefferson talked about how democracy should be I'm dependent on the people alone now it doesn't mean that we won't take other forms of revenue in terms of advertising different platforms at cetera but you see what's going on with YouTube Facebook and all platforms and you see that it is an uncertain ocean out there but if we have a hundred thousand members that is our Independence Day and and that means nobody can move us off of this sad day for them you know if this pulls out or that pulls out or this insider doesn't like what we're saying or that insider wants to do something else sad day for them once you have that you have progressive Netflix lockdown you get all the shows and a show no filter John show damage report are all podcasts within the network you've got aggressive progressives old school our post game after the show here you got the entire to the Young Turks and they'll never be able to take it away and as the 2020 election heats some of me you saw what we did in 2018 we backed all those wonderful progressive candidates Alexandra Castillo Cortez Andrew Gilliam all the people who want but we also back the people who lost we're proud of that because we fight for our ideas and our principles even if it's risky and we get to that safe haven of a hundred thousand subscribers and no one no force on earth can take that away from progressives so just in terms of what do you get in in terms of content let me just show you real quick and this is a relatively new feature that we put up some of you are already familiar with it $4.99 it used to be ten dollars for $4.99 you're getting access to the TYT member shows all of our shows including extras

once we get to those numbers that we're talking about we could then continue to grow and add more and more shows from there on it's gravy you want a progressive show we get a couple more members we get another progressive show and another and another when we build upon that but we've got to build this rock first so tea y-t-dot-com /join let's all do it together yes boom okay so we will be updating you throughout today's show and throughout all these shows on where we sat on the thermometer and what is exciting about this guys even if you don't care about the enters or you don't even like The Young Turks is either way you're gonna get to find out how we do it is going to be incredibly public and no one else takes risks like this but we do it because that's how we roll we take risks when it comes to backing progresses we take risks on air that's because we're here to fight for you guys when we look at the thermometer one more time okay just take a look okay now let's make note okay twenty-seven thousand six hundred sixty-one all right all right now can we get thirty thousand by the end of the show well that would be something but I like how bold Ana is that's why she
