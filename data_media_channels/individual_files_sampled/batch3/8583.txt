MY DAD USED TO REACH FOR THE BELT. HE NEVER HAD TO PULL IT OUT. AS LONG AS THE KIDS ARE SCARED THAT'S WHY YOU THINK, INSTILL FEAR. AS LONG AS YOU'RE AFRAID, MY DAD NEVER HAD TO PUNISH ME. THERE WAS NO PUNISHMENT BECAUSE IZ WAS SO SCAISHED I NEVER DID ANYTHING WRONG. DON'T PLAY FAIR. IF YOU'RE PLAYING CHESS OR SOMETHING YOU DON'T PRETEND TO LOSE TO MAKE YOUR KIDS HAPPY? NO. I'M IN THE PROCESS OF BEATING MY DAUGHTER AT CHESS RIGHT NOW. WE PAUSED THE GAME. DO NOT LET THEM WIN. THE WORLD IS NOT FAIR. WHEN THEY SAY DAD, THAT'S NOT FAIR. THE WORLD IS NOT FAIR.

HE USED TO DRAG US AROUND TO THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR SITES, THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL, THE FREEDOM TRAIL.
