we do have an update on the Thailand situation where 12 boys and their soccer coach are trapped in a cave essentially they went if you don't know the story they went cave exploring and then the rains hit they flooded the entrance to the cave and now the kids can't get out they were found after nine days very hungry but healthy currently efforts to get them out are incredibly difficult the problem is they have had divers you know go in there they've had medical personnel check on them and they're okay but the entranceway to the cave is a incredibly narrow it's two-and-a-half miles and most of it is flooded the water is very murky so it's it's you know we're talking about kids who are like 11 to 16 who can't just you know so a lot of them don't know how to swim so right now efforts to get them out are focused on maybe teaching them how to scuba dive maybe trying to pump water out of some portions of the cave system and it's it's a pretty precarious situation because it's July which means it's the start of monsoon season in Thailand and if the flooding gets any worse it could flood the cave that they're currently in so the clock is ticking sunday is is supposed to be heavy rains and you know on the on the plus side right now there they're all alive they're all healthy and the Thailand government is being helped by the UK Australia a lot of neighboring countries there there is a collective effort to get them out even Elon Musk has said that he'll you know give any kind of I know Elon and I have had beef recently but this is great I mean I mean I know I did Costa lutely are you know Ward him I mean well we both we did a little bit of swearing back yeah yeah but imma and Elon has that digging machine right yeah he said he'll help any way he can with the boring company I just understood why it's called that yeah what I don't understand so they have they are able to get things to them yes so if they can get stuff to them how come they can't get some sort of breathing kit that lets you because it's a six-hour like deep diving mission you're not a deep-diving it's just too different it's deadly it's already done for the divers I mean these are expert divers they they've you know I was listening to a radio interview with one of them and and it sounds like the path to even get to that stage of diving is is incredibly you know this is like the SWAT of diving right they refer to it and then the water is dark these kids don't know how to swim and what's worse is you know you'd think like we'll just tandem tie them to a diver and take one out at a time but some of these passageways are so narrow that even it's even difficult to get through them with the gear much less a second person yeah so I got really far in there - well it was dry at the time yeah that's that's the I mean it's just incredibly bad timing I mean we'll really have to see how this plays out because it's it's what is their plan at this point because I read earlier today that they had been attempting to do some draining and accidentally they pumped a bunch of extra water in there well so essentially what happened there was there were volunteers at the scene there's a lot of volunteers thankfully but some of them so that there's there's a way of there's an own way of trying to reduce flooding which is to pump water into the ground in this case they are under the ground so some volunteers were trying to do that thinking that they were helping and in fact they were making the flooding a bit worse but they do have pumping machines trying to get water out of some of them more difficult to navigate areas but there's even I mean the the toughest thing if there is a mile-long stretch that is all under water I've never swam 1/3 of a mile right and that under water yeah that's that's I mean you have to be an extremely experienced diver to do something like that and I mean like I said some of these kids don't know how to swim at all I mean they're 11 to 16 this is so I'm assuming that they're trying to dig down to them or something like that - there are yeah there are some other so they're also looking for for alternate shafts that they might be able to get to so so through the ground that aren't through like the known the known entrance to the cave that they came in through there was a report that some of the kids said that they had heard some other noise working and chickens or Brewster's yes like that and they are looking for tunnels because at some point they were looking for the ability to tunnel in some way now they're just looking for existing tunnels that way but it also could be a host nation it yeah that's that's a good thing it may I mean being trapped in the dark for nine days terrifies is terrifying yeah I mean that this is a you know my heart goes out to these kids this is it's so scary to do you're inside they're getting the I saw the pictures of them getting the old military telephone kind of contraption going so but they're trying to you know get it so these kids can talk to their family Wow Wow so sad so unexpected too and obviously that the worst part is that there is a time limit on how long they have before they can get them out right because they're afraid if it raining again it's you know two easy ways for the young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and ii is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you are notified of our videos
