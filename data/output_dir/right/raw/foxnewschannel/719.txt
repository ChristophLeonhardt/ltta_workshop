117
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,924

SKIN, BEATEN WITH A CINDER BLOCK

119
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:20,330
IN THE HEAD ON CAMERA, WATERS

120
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:21,564
PARTIED WITH THEM AFTER HIS

121
00:04:25,703 --> 00:04:27,503
WASHINGTON KNOWS THAT AND

122
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:28,338
DEMOCRATS DON'T CARE.

123
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:30,106
CHUCK SCHUMER DID CALLED WATERS

124
00:04:30,107 --> 00:04:33,142
IN HIS MOST RECENT REMARKS "NOT

125
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:34,644

126
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:43,953
THAT WAS THE THEME.

127

THE TOTALITARIAN BEHAVIOR IS

130
00:04:52,963 --> 00:04:54,163
SHOCKING AND HORRENDOUS.

131
00:04:54,164 --> 00:04:55,965
WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT.

132
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:57,567
>> THEY FOLLOW THE EXACT PATTERN

133
00:04:57,568 --> 00:05:00,770
THAT HAS OR HAS, HE IS EVIL.

134
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:02,171
AND AT THE THING IS, I THOUGHT I

135
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:04,107
WILL COME IN AND HE WOULDN'T

136
00:05:04,108 --> 00:05:05,775
REALLY KNOW BECAUSE HE HAS TO DO

137
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:08,544
HIS SHOWMANSHIP THING, BUT HE'S

138
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:08,845
EVIL.

139
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:12,315
>> THIS IS PURE AND SIMPLE RACE,

140
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:14,350
RACISM, THAT'S ALL THIS IS.

141
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:15,785
PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT HIM ARE

142
00:05:15,786 --> 00:05:18,588
FRIGHTENED TO DEATH OF THIS

00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:21,424
COUNTRY BECOMING THE BROWNING OF

144
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:25,995
INTERESTING IS HAPPENING.

145
00:05:25,996 --> 00:05:28,131
AS PROGRESSIVES BECOME MORE

146
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:29,699
AUTHORITARIAN AND LESS,

147
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,333
TOLERANT, THEY SEEM MORE

148
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:34,704
CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE FIGHTING

149
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:36,539
ACTUAL RATHER THAN THEIR FELLOW

150
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,540
AMERICANS.

151
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,742
THE MORE THEY ACCUSED THE

152
00:05:39,743 --> 00:05:41,277
ADMINISTRATION OF EXTREMISM, THE

153
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:45,948
ONCE YOU DECIDE THAT THE PEOPLE

154
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:49,152
WHO DISAGREE WITH YOU ARE NAZIS,

155
00:05:49,153 --> 00:05:49,919
EVERYTHING IS ALLOWED.

156
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,959
THIS COULD VERY WELL END IN

157
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,262
TRAGEDY, SOME PROGRESSIVE SEEMED

158
00:05:59,263 --> 00:06:00,730
TO WELCOME ALL THAT.

159
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:08,104
SUPPORTS DEMOCRATS.

160
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:10,740
IT IS SAYS THEY ARE ACCOMPLICES.

161
00:06:10,741 --> 00:06:13,109
THIS IS THE LANGUAGE OF TOTAL

162
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,943
WAR.

163
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:17,513
IT'S SCARY, NO PLACE IN

164
00:06:17,514 --> 00:06:17,880
POLITICS.

165
00:06:17,881 --> 00:06:19,248
THE ONLY PLACE THAT CAN STOP IT

166
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:21,350
ARE THE ADULTS ON THE LEFT.

167
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:25,655
THERE ARE STILL SOME DEMOCRATIC

168
00:06:25,656 --> 00:06:26,789
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, AND MEDIA

169
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,324
CHIEFTAINS LIKE JEFF ZUCKER AT

170
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:32,128
CNN OR ANTI-LAC AT CNBC.

171
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:32,862
THEY ARE COWERING AND COMPLICIT

172
00:06:32,863 --> 00:06:34,931
IN ALL OF THIS BUT THE COUNTRY

173
00:06:34,932 --> 00:06:35,932
BADLY NEEDS THEM TO COOL THE

174
00:06:40,370 --> 00:00:00,000
CHANNELS.
