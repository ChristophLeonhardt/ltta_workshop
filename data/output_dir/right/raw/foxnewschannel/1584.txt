00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:04,663
FOR SOME MOMENTUM ON IN CONGRES

4
00:00:04,663 --> 00:00:05,030
CONGRESS.

5
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,697
KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE

6
00:00:05,697 --> 00:00:06,999
ACTIVITY OVER AT THE WHITE HOUSE

7
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:07,799
THIS EVENING.

8
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,835
IN THE MEANTIME, BY

ROBERT MUELLER TO WRAP UP THIS

13
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,209
PROBE.

14
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:18,810
>> I JUST THINK FOR THE SAKE OF

15
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,845
THE COUNTRY, AND I THINK IT'S

16
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:21,380
TIME THAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL

17
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,449
WRAP IT UP AND I THINK THAT'S

18
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,820
PROBABLY AN OPINION WIDELY

19
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,589
SHARED BY PEOPLE ALL ACROSS

20
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:31,256
AMERICA.

21
00:00:31,256 --> 00:00:32,791
>> Martha: HILLARY CLINTON'S

22
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,259
FORMER TOP ADVISOR AGREES.

23
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:35,694
HE WROTE A VERY FORCEFUL PIECE

24
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:36,395
ON THIS TODAY.

25
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:38,830

AND TEXAS CONGRESSMAN JOHN

30

RATCLIFFE, A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE

00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:47,272
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, VERY

32
00:00:47,272 --> 00:00:48,440
INVOLVED IN THIS INVESTIGATION

33
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,041
AS WELL.

34
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:49,841
GENTLEMEN, GOOD TO SEE YOU

35
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:50,175
TONIGHT.

36
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,910
THANKS FOR BEING APPEAR ON THE

37
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:52,744
ROOFTOP WITH US.

38
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:54,413
HE WROTE TODAY THAT THE DEEP

39
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:56,081
STATE IS IN A DEEP STATE OF

40
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:58,850
DESPERATION, WHAT DID YOU MEAN?

41
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,751
>> I THINK THE INSPECTOR

42
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:02,621
GENERAL'S REPORT IS COMING OUT.

43
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:03,789
I THINK DEVIN NUNES IS FINDING

44
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:05,824
OUT WHAT WERE THE ORIGINS OF THE

45
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:06,258
INVESTIGATION.

46
00:01:06,258 --> 00:01:08,627
AND THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A

47
00:01:08,627 --> 00:01:09,795
REAL CONCRETE INTELLIGENCE

48
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:12,030
ORIGIN FOR THIS INVESTIGATION

49
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,066
AND WITHOUT A FOUNDATION, ONE

50
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,634
WONDERS WHAT DID WE SPEND AN

51
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:16,601
ENTIRE YEAR ON?

52
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:18,203
WHAT DID WE DISRUPT EVERYONE WHO

53
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,171
WAS IN THE CAMPAIGN, EVERYONE

54
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:20,372
WHO WAS IN THE ADMINISTRATION,

55
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:24,409
AND I'VE SEEN -- I SPENT A YEAR

56
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:25,243
FIGHTING THIS THING WITH KEN

57
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:27,479
STARR AND I THINK THIS THING IS

58
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,414
JUST PLAIN WRONG THAT HAS GOT TO

59
00:01:29,414 --> 00:01:30,248
BE ENDED AT STOPPED.

60
00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:33,618
>> Martha: THE REACTION THIS

61
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:34,619
MORNING ON A LOT OF CHANNELS TO

62
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:35,620
THE REPORT THAT THE PRESIDENT

63
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,590
WANTS AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT

64
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,926
HAPPENED DURING HIS CAMPAIGN AND

65
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:42,994
WHO MAY HAVE BEEN INFILTRATING

66
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:45,397
HIS CAMPAIGN PERHAPS TO ENSNARE

67
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,765
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE CAMPAIGN.

68
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:48,834
THE WORDS THAT WERE USED THIS

69
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,435
MORNING, AND ABUSE OF POWER,

70
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:52,504
ERIC HOLDER SAYS THIS INQUIRY IS

71
00:01:52,504 --> 00:01:54,606
DANGEROUS AND THREATENING.

72
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:56,007
>> I DON'T SEE IT IS DANGEROUS

73
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:57,742
AND THREATENING.

74
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,345
I THINK IT APPEARS THE FBI RAN

75
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:00,912
SOME STING OPERATIONS.

76
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,114
WE REALLY SEE AND HEAR PEOPLE

77
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:03,782
INDICTED FOR UNRELATED CHARGES

78
00:02:03,782 --> 00:02:06,785
IN ORDER TO FLIP ON THE

79
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:07,586
PRESIDENT.

80
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,622
WE FOUND PEOPLE'S LIVES BEING

81
00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:11,590
TOTALLY DISRUPTED AND RUINED IN

82
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,125
ORDER TO GET THE OBJECTIVE OF

83
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,793
GET THE PRESIDENT.

84
00:02:14,793 --> 00:02:16,628
WE GET THE PRESIDENT THROUGH

85
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:16,995
ELECTIONS.

86
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:18,396
AND IF WE DON'T GET BACK TO

87
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:22,701
WINNING OUR BATTLES ON ISSUES,

88
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:24,102
DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, IT'S

89
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,837
1998 ALL OVER AGAIN AND THAT THE

90
00:02:25,837 --> 00:02:26,404
PATTERN WE'VE SEEN.

91
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:28,240
WE'VE SEEN THE LESS THEY COME UP

92
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,242
WITH THE MORE THEY INVESTIGATE

93
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:30,842
INSTEAD OF THE OPPOSITE.

94
00:02:30,842 --> 00:02:31,910
>> Martha: THESE FOLKS ARE

95
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,044
VERY UNSETTLED BY THIS WHOLE

96
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:33,345
THING.

97
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:34,346
JOHN BRENNAN TWEETED THIS TODAY.

98
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:35,914
LET'S PUT IT UP ON THE SCREEN

99
00:02:35,914 --> 00:02:37,115
AND SHOW EVERYBODY AT HOME.

100
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,584
HE THINKS THAT THIS IS AN

101
00:02:39,584 --> 00:02:40,285
OUTRAGE, WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

102
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:40,685
HAS DONE.

103
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:43,221
THERE IT IS.

104
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:44,823
McCONNELL AND SPEAKER RYAN, IF

105
00:02:44,823 --> 00:02:46,224
MR. TRUMP CONTINUES ALONG THIS

106
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:47,592
DISASTROUS PATH YOU WILL BEAR

107
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:52,430
MAJOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

108
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,598
HARM DONE TO OUR DEMOCRACY.

109
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:55,433
IF YOU CONTINUE TO ENABLE

110
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:56,635
MR. TRUMP'S SELF-SERVING

111
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:56,968
ACTIONS.

112
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,470
JOHN BRENNAN HAS BEEN ON A TEAR

113
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,704
UNLESS FOR SOME TIME.

114
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:02,641
HERE'S JAMES CLAPPER.

115
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,642
>> SO IF THERE WAS SOMEONE THAT

116
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,511
WAS OBSERVING THAT SORT OF

117
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:09,214
THING, THAT'S A GOOD THING.

118
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:10,115
>> Martha: TALKING ABOUT THE

119
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:14,386
PEOPLE IN THE CAMPAIGN.

120
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:15,220
>> BRENNAN AND KLAPPER AND

121
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,587
COMEY.

122
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:17,822
THEY ALL HAVE A LOT AT STAKE

123
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:18,123
HERE.

124
00:03:18,123 --> 00:03:18,823
THEIR DECISIONS ARE THE ONES

125
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,826
THAT ARE BEING LOOKED AT.

126
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:22,561
THE ACTIONS THAT THEY TOOK ARE

127
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:26,031
REALLY AT THE BASIS OF WHAT THE

128
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:26,865
CHAIRMAN ARE TRYING TO GET THESE

129
00:03:26,865 --> 00:03:29,134
DOCUMENTS RELATING TO, HOW DID

130
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:32,604
THIS INFILTRATION OF THE TRUMP

131
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:34,039
CAMPAIGN OR FOLKS ASSOCIATED

132
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,607
WITH THE CAMPAIGN BEGAN?

133
00:03:35,607 --> 00:03:37,842
AGAIN, NOT THE IDENTITY OF THE

134
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,644
INFORMANT, BUT THE PREDICATE

135
00:03:39,644 --> 00:03:42,847
DOCUMENTS, THE FBI 302S AND THE

136
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,049
1023S THAT WILL ANSWER THE

137
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:45,317
QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE

138
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:46,551
WAS AN APPROPRIATE PURPOSE

139
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:49,221
BEHIND THIS AS OPPOSED TO AN

140
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:49,988
INAPPROPRIATE POLITICAL PURPOSE.

141
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:52,257
>> Martha: THE BIG QUESTION IS

142
00:03:52,257 --> 00:03:53,225
HOW CIRCULAR THIS WHOLE THING

143
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:54,226
WAS.

144
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:56,428
DID THEY HAVE SOMEONE, AND

145
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:57,295
INFORMANT, BECAUSE THEY HAD

146
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:58,029
EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS

147
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,599
SOMETHING GOING ON?

148
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,167
OR DID THEY HAVE THE INFORMANT

149
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:04,236
BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO BAIT

150
00:04:04,236 --> 00:04:05,570
PEOPLE INTO DOING SOMETHING

151
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,538
WRONG?

152
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:06,905
>> RIGHT.

153
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:10,442
THAT'S ULTIMATELY THE QUESTION,

154
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:11,209
THESE ARE FAIR QUESTIONS THAT WE

155
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,411
HAVE TO GET THE ANSWER TO THAT

156
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:14,412
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THOSE ANSWERS

157
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:17,048
ARE IN CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS THE

158
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,216
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVEN'T

159
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:18,516
SEEN.

160
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:19,284
APPARENTLY SOME MEMBERS OF THE

161
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:20,619
MEDIA HAD SEEN THEM AND IT

162
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:22,153
RAISES QUESTION IN AND OF

163
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:22,487
ITSELF.

164
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:24,322
BUT WE GOT TO KEEP PRESSING ON

165
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:24,856
THIS.

166
00:04:24,856 --> 00:04:26,424
MARK RAISES FAIR POINTS.

167
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:28,059
WE'VE SEEN UNPRECEDENTED ACTIONS

168
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,662
TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH

169
00:04:30,662 --> 00:04:33,231
POLITICAL CANDIDATES AND

170
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,600
CAMPAIGNS AND FOR THE

171
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:36,234
COMMUNITY AND OUR

172
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,602
LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY.

173
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:38,903
THESE ARE FAIR QUESTIONS THAT

174
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:39,638
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE REALLY

175
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:40,739
CONCERNED ABOUT.

176
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,008
>> Martha: THIS IS A 400 PAGE

177
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:43,375
DOCUMENT.

178
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,709
THERE IS A LOT IN THERE AND A

179
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:46,911
LOT OF FOLKS ARE SWEATING IT OUT

180
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:47,379
LOT OF FOLKS ARE SWEATING IT OU

181
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:47,812
OUT.

182
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:49,014
>> THAT'S WHY I SAID THE DEEP

183
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:50,849
STATE IS IN A DEEP STATE OF

184
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:51,249
DESPERATION.

185
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,020
IF THIS REPORT IS REALLY

186
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,187
CRITICAL OF COMEY AND OTHERS IN

187
00:04:56,187 --> 00:04:57,188
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IT

188
00:04:57,188 --> 00:04:58,857
WILL OPEN A FLOODGATE AGAINST

189
00:04:58,857 --> 00:04:59,824
THEM.

190
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:01,893
AND IF YOU GO BACK AND READ THE

191
