welcome I am just wondering Elina when did you know that you had to become a camera person when do you know this is my job I have to do it when my son was born 18 years before I knew I had to say camera it just looks so exciting and ability to tell my story my way and I never looked back did anyone choices dissuade you did anybody say that's a terrible idea don't do that yeah people ask me what is the woman doing the camera man's job and my answer was well you know take on them and the news would have a different angle different details before intuitive and we can bring bought the camera worked so why not give it let me share this with you this is from alia Chuck ty alia is an Al Jazeera English interactive journalism journalist she remembers the first journalist who inspired her was Kate ad who worked for the BBC really famous in fact soldiers in the UK forces whenever they saw k80 turning up they knew that they were in trouble and a crisis was about to happen hold her for you who inspired you to become a journalist well actually I was inspired by challenge myself it's not really what unfortunately when I started it was maybe dominated by men so yeah there were a few men who inspired me but I remember when I went started to work in the field that was as a as a producer as a field producer and more than once I was told you shouldn't go to that place that's not really a place for women especially in the Middle East and of course each time I was told that then I wanted to go more so and I wanted to prove that actually I could offer in certain areas despite the preconceptions and sort of stereotypes perceived and that's how media stood it was more of a challenge everyone was telling me I couldn't do it mmm best piece of advice that you were given when you were thrown onto the air what was it tell our audience well I was pretty funny I was told by someone quite famous oh remember your woman people don't listen to what you say they watch you more so I was sort of trying to end that might look imagine more than my words but on a more serious note that were still actually to always try to be myself and that's how I would actually be able to convey a message to the viewer let me just bring this bring you into the conversation I'm looking at some pictures of the 2004 tsunami which you covered extensively when you look at these pictures talk us through how it got the story how you told that story yeah and I look at that picture then I completely clearly remember how how difficult it was to cover this story because it was first of all very difficult to get there because everything was destroyed and then there was nothing there was just nothing left so basically I was very lucky I met a young student who offered me a place he still had a room and he still had some electricity so we can I camp out there I was still actually a VJ at the time I worked for Dutch television who I had to shoot my own story and the woman you just saw that was a woman I still admire a lot she actually lost her this woman she lost three children during the tsunami and I'm still a very good friend of hers and she's always been my example because how she pulled out of that awful situation has been very very admire about she's actually really one of the strongest women I've ever met in my life so it was a very very difficult story to cover I was there for like weeks in a row I lost five kilos and my mother became so worried that she actually asked the channel to pull me back which I totally refused you your mum rang up the channel and said you need to bring my daughter home yes because her friends and neighbours were getting so worried that they thought I was gonna die I was losing so much weight I was looking so awful more and more tired every day but I didn't want to give up let me show this picture here because on the picture we have because we're having trouble connecting with you so we're on the phone picture you we have a review on the phone is looking glamorous this is you 2004 where your mum is so worried about you she's calling the boss to bring you home did you come words with her stepdad was with her later I can't think of anything more embarrassing than having my parents cowork and tell them off what are you doing you know this is my mission my job but she actually was very proud of me that I did stay good yeah I want to get personal in this conversation because we're so lucky to have all of you here and we talk about your work all of the time but there's stuff that happens behind the scenes that we don't always share aleena many years ago 14 years ago you were at the Bethel and siege and yours are in mind people about that story because it was quite a long time ago so I want to show a little clip of what you did there your camera work there every morning Annetta goes to the memorial cemetery every morning she seeks forgiveness mommy didn't protect you mommy didn't save you I left you there I thought all three of us would die if we stayed why don't you come to me in my dreams yeah would you just recap because we played the clip just as you're about to describe what was happening so set the scene what was happening right there and the terrorists were negotiating Tibet they women it's out and she had to make choice terrible choice which one child behind Terri's saved a life every day she asked herself if she made the right choice and when I met her she didn't want to talk at all definitely not keep the interview TV on words but she wanted to share somebody I was story and it was absolutely heartbreaking at the end she decided to give us the meeting Anantha and hearing story seeing how she was able to leave Spain really gave me an amazing strength and a point the fact that she is really tough I actually asked her many times why you're a camera person why do you carry all these bags all the time why didn't you just remain as a producer but she has this eye while all the other camera and the same story are pointing at something Elena's going to take these little details that really make the story so good and actually makes your writing it inspires you to write a story to write a different storage it really has this very different I and I have to also tell you I've worked with Stephanie at a certain point she was producing me and she was ruthless I have to say so let's hear about this roof first Stephanie Stephanie so you're working in the field together we're looking at which of you working here together I want to share a couple of thoughts here from our online community who are watching this Deborah D'Souza says she's faced in in India and she writes for investopedia and has a bylines in vice and scroll and she said it's really frustrating the energy spent trying to ensure my personal safety and wrong about doing certain important stories because of fear of retaliation are there so you can share that fit into that category because I'm just going to show some of the the pictures that you sent to us and this is you in Libya back in 2012 and this is you in Mosul again so you are going to some of the hottest spots in the entire world as far as journalism is concerned safety how do you do that I think yeah safety it's always a team effort I think you know working for an organization like Al Jazeera's we're starved for privilege that we do work in a team for example freelancers haven't very you know different challenges because often they work alone so you know we assess things on the ground we plan I think you know there's there's different dangers there sort of the frontline danger of war but then you also have dangerous for example when you're working with local staff in a country where certain stories can get them in trouble you know if you're a foreigner and you're flying in you can do a story you can fly out or you but you can be deported but you need to think about the people that are working with you that are crucial to the story that are getting you access and who may face that retaliation later because they come from the country they are staying they have family they have children so these are things that also are also factored in behind the scenes that you probably don't hear up that much you know when the final product gets on air there's a lot of choices that go into that let me play this to you this is Liana agar janya and she is a journalist and this is what she told us about how she even Billy gates that idea about staying safe and also being on the front lines have a look whenever I know I'm going to find myself in a situation while reporting that would potentially make me feel unsafe and that goes for being in the US and abroad a tactic that I like to employ is to bring someone along with me and often when the magazine isn't able to send a photographer out or I can't find a fixed area the person that usually comes with me as my partner and his presence seems to create this invisible border around potentially unsafe situations anywhere from comments about my personal life to more dangerous issues like harassment bringing your partner with you is that even practical well I think what she's saying there is yeah is having that company like we have a team but many journalists and if they're freelancers and if they're women are on their own and I think that sometimes in certain situations in certain places can be a real challenge for a girl on her own so I can understand that whether it's your partner or you know your best friend or just someone you meet who you trust and say just come with me for the next couple of days to give you that sort of company because it can also be very lonely during it was really a panic moment on that road in Libya where the rebels were going back and forth and there was believe it or not in the middle of the desert there was a traffic jam because they were scarce and in the middle of all that there was a you're a freelance photographer standing with her carry on and was basically trying to hitchhike a ride back to Benghazi because her driver and her fixer basically fled because they got scared and they left her there alone and I remember being extremely shocked about that image of this photographer with all her cameras hanging around her neck this blue carry-on bright blue carry-on and poor girl I mean she was really scared I mean if we took her in with us and she spent the night with us where we had the location where we were but I kept on looking at here with lots of admiration next day we retreated and she decided to stay on on the front line and I thought I mean us as Stephanie said in TV we have a team we have a support system somehow but freelancers is extremely difficult and they completely abandoned to themselves and I'm not really sure whether they're you know headquarters or whoever they report to is really aware how difficult it is especially you I mean imagine you're all alone with a carry on and all around you it's basically men maybe 2% of the people around you're women what we're going to say go ahead what yeah what I often do in this is a kind of situation we we just started we will join forces basically also with freelancers in the field as because it's very important to have this team effort I have to say since I'm working for al-jazeera I feel my safety in that sense has increased compared to my work before as a video journalist when I was traveling alone a lot here in Indonesia to the point actually that al-jazeera really insist that we travel together I had a recent example of a trip to Farquhar where it's very difficult to get access to and the situation is very uncertain and at that point you weren't sure if the producer could actually come along because of us was a very small plane and then the death in Doha insisted that we would travel together because of the dangers that we face in which we would be alone and that's that's absolutely the case when you're travelling when you're working in the field you have to have someone who has your back very important there's some practicalities that you have to think about when you're working in these are conversations that we absolutely never have on TV so you are in the field you're perhaps in Mosul for instance Stephanie and then you have to think of basically your biological functions and needs you're absolutely right it's hydration so you just dehydrate because you don't drink yeah so we've just that's just something you don't do yeah and yes absolutely that time of the month I mean one thing is if you need to you know go for a wee somehow you can do it I remember once in Libya we were driving we were going to Xin tan it was open roads there wasn't a bush there was no protection and it was two cars and it was all men and it was just me and we radioed to the car and I said guys I'm sorry like I have to go so we stopped they will open the doors they all went to the other side and you know you just have to you think okay I'm a lady close your eyes and you just have to you just have to go away there's nothing to do about it but it's certainly certainly when it comes to that time of the month sometimes you don't have access to bathrooms you know for an entire day these very difficult things that no one talks about but as well but of course is the challenges that you have to just sort of get over and wet wipes become your new best friend for instance let me share this with you imagine that audience I'm not going to go into details here sometimes you don't get to shower or bath or anything tan yo Rasheed says on Twitter I am able to navigate different worlds and develop more nuanced stories and connections because she feels she has a insight into I suppose if we're looking breaking this down into gender that she has a way of telling stories in a different way aleena I know that resonates with you don't unpack that a bit more for us you know it's not a secret that women and ethnic minorities have to work much harder maybe sometimes twice as hard to get in a perceiving and opportunity a chance to put your story to tell your story to the world so we're you know we have to be you have to take that my many more risks that's that many more challenges on the order you know to be treated equally and of course you know you can always talk about the Payette gap and you know other forms of discrimination but I think women therefore that much more you know that much stronger and more talented and the work comes out better we're both quite short and you're surrounded by this you're in a man's world really especially the places we go to it and they sort of at the beginning look at us and think that you know these are two girls we anything can pass we can we can have the upper hand we can lead them and I know you once I remember and she the person was explaining why we couldn't do certain things and just looked at that person and said don't tell don't tell me about the pain show me the baby and I thought the guy's white just trying to repress it and actually after that well everything worked I knew there was a piece of advice that you were given when you started as a journalist that was so great that I need you to share it with the rest of the world okay you know I met this lady and she said there's one thing you should know there's no such a thing as a happy journalist in their 40s you have you proved that piece of advice wrong I haven't yet but you know it's a struggle it's a daily struggle your your job and you'll get out there with all the excitement you had 20 years ago and you know it keeps us it keeps us happy keeps us and outsoles and it keeps the work I think you can't do this job without loving it you have to love it it has to be part of you you want to tell people's stories because you know it can be so difficult and it can be so challenging and I think all of us you know and we're really a good sort of team of colleagues as well there's a lot of love and camaraderie between us and I think you really have to be committed because of the sacrifices you make also in your life you know we're traveling all the time you know I remember producing heard it many years ago which was actually the first time I came on air because about on al-jazeera because she had to go back were the northern Iraq and she had to go back to London to pick up her wedding dress so we agreed well the teams here staff why don't you go into a feature so Jota goes to London for the weekend she comes back with the wedding dress which got into our 4x4 you know over the equipment and we were all sort of taking good care of it so that was a very good example of you know how to balance your personal life and work life but also you know from behalf of my career as a correspondent thanks to her getting married let me let me end with one last clip here and this is takes us back to 2011 and this is Libya and how did a story about the women of Benghazi look at this claim station is difficult to handle for Layla her 21 years old son is at the front line and pray for him and suddenly some much awaited news on the fighter Benja what has been liberated an explosion of joy fills the school naina calls her son imagine yes I feel that joy as I'm watching you how - and you're telling that story if you could do any story now bearing in mind that al-jazeera is currently watching what story would you want to do next and I think it's very for me it's very important I mean I've done a lot of conflict a lot of frontline a lot of that excitement and adrenaline but I came to the conclusion that it's really giving voices to the people to the people who live these horrors to the people you know just give faces to all of these pictures and voices that might especially today in this polarized world but I really feel at this point it's much more important to try to sort of make it less sensational as the coverage of it of a war and bring it down - really there are human beings they are living Horrors these are traumatized people and these are the generation of the future this is what the mistake the world in the future and now with you know the biggest refugee crisis since World War two all these people all over the world mostly unwelcome all over the world with it 90 seconds left Hoda you've heard that in your ear before let me just quickly go around the other journalists so to be cheeky there step so you would like to cover next I want to go back to pop why I just have been there because there like a hunger malnutrition babies dying of hunger but also what I noticed there and that I think a class on being a woman women told me horrible stories when I was there and they probably wouldn't have told me same stories through a mere male colleague they also told me about domestic violence they had stories of the the man eating all the food and say they look really bad they all look very very skinny and very ill I really want to go back there and expose that story to the world it's a very much untold story in in prop one markeith of indonesia alright so Stefan's definitely anilina and Hodor thank you so much for being on our international women days special and looking at your journalism and also behind the scenes of how you get your stories onto the air really appreciate it take care everybody happy International Women's Day and I just have enough time to tell you about next week we are taking the string to the annual South by Southwest Conference for media music and technology in Austin Texas so
