DONALD TRUMP HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF
CRITICISM, FROM OUR SHOW
PRIMARILY, BUT FROM A LOT OF
QUARTERS, THAT HE DOESN'T
FUNDAMENTALLY KNOW THE FACTS
ABOUT HEALTH INSURANCE.
BUT A
LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT'S NOT
JUST HEY IT'S SAD THAT OUR
PRESIDENT DOESN'T KNOW THE
DETAILS OF ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT NEEDS TO
BE DONE, A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO
BE SOLVED IN AMERICA, BUT ALSO
THAT IT'S HURTING HIS PARTY'S
CHANCE OF PASSING SOME SORT OF
ALTERNATE PLAN.
SO HE CAN'T TALK
ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE SENATE BILL
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T SEEM TO
UNDERSTAND.
IF YOU GAVE HIM A
COUPLE OF TERMS HE WOULDN'T
REMEMBER THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE
ATTACHED TO ANY CONCEPTS IN HIS
BRAIN.
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY
THEY TRIED TO PREPARE HIM A
LITTLE BIT FOR THIS MEETING.
SO
JAYAR JACKSON WENT THROUGH AND
COMPILED SOME OF THE THINGS HE
REFERENCED ABOUT THE PLAN, NOW
HE IS TALKING ABOUT SPECIFICS
ABOUT IT, BUT WATCH THIS VIDEO
BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT
THE WAY HE TALKED ABOUT THOSE
SPECIFICS.
>>WE NEVER SELL OUR PLAN.
IF WE
ARE WEAK ON ANYTHING IT'S ABOUT
LETTING PEOPLE KNOW HOW GOOD IT
WAS SO WE WROTE THESE THINGS.
REPEALS THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE,
REPEALS JOB KILLING EMPLOYER
MANDATE, WILL SUBSTANTIALLY
LOWER PREMIUMS.
YOUR PREMIUMS
WILL BE DOWN 60 AND THESE
THINGS.
REPEALS THE INDIVIDUAL
MANDATE, REPEALS JOB KILLING
EMPLOYER MANDATE, WILL
SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PREMIUMS.
YOUR PREMIUMS WILL BE DOWN
60, 70%, PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT.
REPEALS BURDENSOME TAXES, BIG.
ALSO PROVIDES FOR EXPANDED
COVERAGE OPTIONS.
WILL STABILIZE
INSURANCE MARKETS.
WILL PROTECT
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION COVERAGE.
YOU WILL HAVE BETTER
PRE-EXISTING THAN THEY HAD IN
THEIR PLAN.
WILL ALLOW THE USE
OF PRETAX DOLLARS TO PAY
PREMIUMS.
WILL DEVOTE
SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO FIGHT
OPIOID AND OTHER SUBSTANCE
ABUSE.
WILL PROVIDE BETTER
COVERAGE FOR LOW-INCOME
AMERICANS.
PUTS MEDICAID ON A
SUSTAINABLE PATH, WHICH IT'S NOT
ON RIGHT NOW.
REFORMS MAJOR
ENTITLEMENTS, NOW A PRINCIPAL
DRIVER OF THE $20
TRILLION DEBT WE HAVE.
>>WE CAN PICK APART THE VARIOUS
LIES IMPLICIT IN THAT, THE 70%
PREMIUM DROPS, THAT'S ABSOLUTE
B.S., BUT JAYAR PRINTED UP HIS
TALKING POINTS BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT HE WAS GIVEN.
THEY KNEW HE
COULDN'T GO TO THAT MEETING AND
TALK ABOUT THE BILL WITH
AUTHORITY AND KNOWLEDGE, SO THEY
DID WHAT YOU SHOULD DO FOR
POLITICIANS, I'M NOT EVEN
KNOCKING THE AIDES, THEY PRINTED
UP THINGS FOR HIM TO SORT OF
EXTEMPORANEOUSLY REFER TO.
LET
ME TALK ABOUT THE TAXES, ETC.
BUT INSTEAD THIS KNUCKLEHEAD
JUST READS THE LITERAL WORDS IN
A BULLET POINT LIST BECAUSE THEY
DON'T MEAN ANYTHING TO HIM.
YOU
COULDN'T SEE ANA'S REACTION BUT
WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, HE SAID
YOU WILL HAVE BETTER
PRE-EXISTING THAN YOU HAVE NOW.
BECAUSE HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT THAT
MEANS.
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHY
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT PRE-EXISTING
CONDITIONS OR HOW HISTORICALLY
THEY MADE IT HARDER FOR YOU TO
GET HEALTH INSURANCE -- TO HIM
THE WORD PRE-EXISTING JUST MEANS
SOMETHING.
SO HE THROWS IT OUT
THERE IS A BUZZWORD.
THIS MEANS
NOTHING TO HIM.
>>IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WE
ALREADY KNOW, BASED ON POLLING,
THAT IS BASE HAS MADE VERY
LOYAL TO HIM.
BUT I'M CURIOUS
WHAT HIS BASE -- IF YOU SIT DOWN
AND HAVE A POLITE CONVERSATION
WITH THEM AND BRING UP THE FACT
THAT HE JUST SAID IT REPEALS THE
EMPLOYER MANDATE, THAT
ESSENTIALLY MEANS THAT IF YOU
ARE A COMPANY THAT EMPLOYS A
CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE UNDER
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT YOU ARE
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE HEALTH
INSURANCE.
HE JUST BRAGGED ABOUT
HOW THE REPLACEMENT PLAN WOULD
DO AWAY WITH THAT, SO YOUR
EMPLOYER DOESN'T HAVE TO PROVIDE
YOU THAT BENEFIT.
IS THAT
SOMETHING HIS BASE IS IN FAVOR
OF?
>>MAYBE SOME PEOPLE VALUE THEIR
COMPANY'S BOTTOM LINE MORE THAN
THEIR FAMILY'S HEALTH.
IT'S
POSSIBLE.
>>I THINK THEY BEEN DISTANT
FORMED TO THE POINT WHERE THEY
UNFORTUNATELY VOTE IN FAVOR OF
THINGS LIKE THAT WITHOUT
REALIZING HOW MUCH IT WOULD
NEGATIVELY AFFECT THEM.
BUT
AGAIN, HE JUST BRAGGED ABOUT
YEAH, YOUR EMPLOYER DOESN'T HAVE
TO PROVIDE THIS BENEFIT THAT
WOULD SAVE YOUR LIFE.
