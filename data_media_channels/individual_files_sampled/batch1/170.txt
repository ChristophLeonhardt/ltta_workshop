Qatar Airways seems to be adhering to an Arab proverb that says write the bad things in sand the good things on a piece of marble the state-owned airline says despite the challenges of the year-old blockade it received numerous industry accolades including best airline of 2017 it did impact us that it increased our flying time it put pressure on my operational cost but it did not stop the will and the determination of us to keep on our path of growth Qatar Airways says it's still auditing its books from last year and can't say exactly how much money the blockade has cost the airline but it says the losses are quote substantial prior to the blockade its profits were soaring in 2016 it earned more than five hundred million dollars a historic high and flew twenty percent more passengers than the year before Qatar Airways says it's defeating the blockade by implementing a strategy of expansion in the last year the airline has added a new fleet of planes allowing it to fly greater distances to more destinations when it lost access to routes in Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Egypt and Bahrain it added them elsewhere and it forged international partnerships in the United States and Italy but Qatar Airways has seen a drop in passengers the cargo division has managed to fill the void not only has it not posted any losses it has managed to maintain its perch as one of the top three cargo companies in the world former cargo perspective it's a lot easier to redeploy that capacity so what we have lost with the GCC countries we've managed to redeploy it the challenges are still not to be able to serve eighteen destinations that we used to serve the CEO of Qatar Airways says the airline can shoulder losses for the foreseeable future and there's no need to ask the government for a bailout but he admits it will be a very different scenario for the company if the blockade becomes a long-term reality for Qatar
