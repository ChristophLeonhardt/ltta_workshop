well the FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh now has more to work with tonight than it did last night including this statement tonight by Brett Cavanaugh's Yale roommate Chad Ludington I unfortunately believe that my oath may probably now experiences flying Brett Kavanaugh was questioned under oath last week about his drinking because he was accused of an attempted rape with his friend mark judge while he was drunk stumbling drunk according to dr. Christine glossy Ford and in the Senate confirmation hearing Brett Kavanaugh was questioned under oath about his drinking in college because Deborah Ramirez has accused Brett Kavanaugh of aggressively exposing himself to her while he was drunk stumbling drunk at a party in a Yale dormitory Deborah Ramirez says that when she had to push Brett Kavanaugh away she was forced to touch him in a way that disgusted and horrified her and so descriptions of Brett Kavanaugh being belligerent and aggressive while being drunk at Yale are now highly relevant to the FBI background investigation of Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh is under oath answers to last week questions last week's questions about drinking now the basis of this week's questions about perjury the New York Times is now reporting according to unnamed White House sources that the FBI will actually be allowed to interview anyone the FBI deems necessary in the Cavanaugh investigation after initial order from the White House limited the FBI investigation to interviewing only four people and those four people did not include Brett Kavanaugh or dr. Christine Blasi Ford but did include Deborah Ramirez Friday on this program two women who were roommates of Deborah Ramirez at Yale said that Brett Kavanaugh frequently got very drunk and they believe that his set of testimony minimizing his drinking was a lie because they themselves both drank with Brett Kavanaugh while in college both of the women's that they believe Deborah Ramirez Deborah Ramirezes accusations against Brett Cavanaugh yesterday Chad Ludington that Yale classmate of Brett Kevin was issued a written statement saying that he was deeply troubled by Brett Cavanaugh's description of his drinking at Yale Chad Ludington is now a professor at North Carolina State University he was a varsity basketball player at Yale Brett Kavanaugh was not on the varsity team but he enjoyed socializing with the varsity players according to Chad Ludington in his written statement professor Ludington said quote Brett was a frequent drinker and a heavy drinker I know because especially in our first two years of college I often drank with him on many occasions I heard Brett slur his words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption not all of which was beer when Brett got drunk he was often belligerent and aggressive on on one of the last occasions I purposefully socialized with Brett I witnessed him respond to a semi hostile remark not by diffusing the situation but by throwing his beer in the man's face and starting a fight that ended with one of our mutual friends in jail and tonight the New York Times has discovered corroborating evidence of the incident that Chad Ludington just described the New York Times has obtained the New Haven police report of an incident that occurred in September 1985 in which Brett Kavanaugh was questioned by police who responded to a bar fight in New Haven in the police report Dom cozily no says that he got into a fight with Brett Kavanaugh and his friends in that bar after Brett Kavanaugh threw ice at him according to the New York Times a witness to the fight said that Chris Dudley a Yale basketball player who was friends with mr. Cavanaugh then hit the man in the ear with a glass according to the police report mr. Cavanaugh did not want to say if he threw the ice or not the police report said the police report referred to the incident as quote an assault Professor Ludington told the story this way to the New York Times mr. Cavanaugh threw his beer at the the guy swung at Brett mister Ludington continued at that point mr. Dudley took his beer and smashed it into the head of the guy who by now had Brett in an embrace I then tried to pull Chris back and a bunch of other guys tried to pull the other guy back I don't know what Brett was doing in the melee but there was blood there was glass there was beer and there was some shouting in the police showed up and so Chad Ludington statement and the New Haven police report now add more corroboration to Deborah Ramirez description of Brett Kavanaugh as being physically aggressive and abusive while drunk NBC News is reporting tonight that Brett Kavanaugh was working on his defense against Deborah Ramirez as accusations before her accusation became public and that is a direct contradiction of Brett Cavanaugh's own testimony about that NBC News is reporting quote in the days leading up to a public allegation that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself to a college classmate the judge and his team were communicating behind the scenes with friends to refute the claim according to text messages obtained by NBC News Carey Bertram who was at Yale with both Kavanagh and his accuser Deborah Ramirez has tried to get those messages to the FBI for its newly reopened investigation into the matter but says she has yet to be contacted by the bureau in a statement to NBC News Carey Bertram who is now a partner in the law firm akin gump said I understand the president Trump in the US Senate have ordered an FBI investigation into certain allegations of sexual misconduct by the nominee Brett Kavanaugh I have no direct or indirect knowledge about any of the allegations against him however I am in receipt of text messages from a mutual friend of both Debbie and mine that raised questions related to the allegations I have not drawn any conclusions as to what the texts may mean or may not mean but I do believe they merit investigation by the FBI and the Senate Harry Burton's lawyer identified two texts for NBC News that indicated that Brett Kavanaugh knew about Debora Ramirez's accusation before the New Yorker made that accusation public on September 23rd before that article was published one friend of Brett Kavanaugh has texted quote that she had been in contact with Brett's guy and also with Brett whom wanted her to go on the record to refute Ramirez that friend of Brett Kavanaugh is also told Carrie Bertram quote that she turned over a copy of the wedding party photo to Kavanaugh writing in a text I had to send it to Brett's team too here's what Brett Kavanaugh said under oath when asked when he first heard of Deborah Ramirez's allegation when did you first hear of mr. Ramirez's allegations against you in the last in a period since then that New Yorkers story during our discussion now Heidi Prez Bella NBC News national political reporter Ron Klain former chief counsel the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill hearings and Barbara McQuade former federal prosecutor she is a professor of law at the University of Michigan and NBC News and MSNBC legal contributor and Heidi it's your reporting tonight about these texts that preceded the New Yorker article and these texts seem to contradict Brett Kavanaugh as under oath testimony that he first heard of the Ramirez accusations by reading The New Yorker article correct Lawrence so we obtained these texts from a third party essentially a woman who had been texting with another fellow classmate of Brett Kavanaugh who had all gone to Yale together she said to me look and she never really wanted to go public on this but she can't get the attention of the FBI she's tried several times to get these text messages through to the FBI and she believes that they prove potentially two things that need to be looked in further one that Brett was fully aware of their reporting that was about to come down to quite what his testimony was there that you just played that her friend who is named Karen yarrow savage was texting her that Brett was essentially trying to get her to do two things one produced that wedding photo because presumably it showed the two of them Debbie and Brett smiling together in a photo ten years after the alleged incident and two to get her to go on the record Karen to go on the record to refute Debbie's story of course Karen never did that she was an anonymous source refuting this story but still my source Kari thinks that this needs to be looked into further in terms of what Brett knew and what he was coordinating and trying to do behind the seeds to refute Debbie's story and secondly there's something I think that you need to point out lower down in the story that's really troubling potentially and that is that these remember this is private correspondence between two friends and Carrie Bertram says in that correspondence that she was very troubled by Debbie's behavior at that wedding ten years after the alleged incident that she said that Debbie wouldn't go near Brett or his friends that she clung to her even though they were technically in a separate peer group it was Debbie who was friends technically with Brett and his friends and yet she wouldn't go anywhere near them and she said in her memo outlining all of this that it all makes sense to me now and Heidi the in your reporting these are texts from Yale Friends of Brett Kavanaugh and so and they're referring to Brett certainly indicating that they there was direct contact with Brett himself about Debbie Ramirez before the New Yorker article came out and that what Brett was looking for was some way to refute what Debbie would say that's right and it was because my source Carrie Bertram who ultimately did go on the record with us about this memo was so concerned about that potential collaboration that she hired a lawyer because she wasn't getting through to the FBI on Sunday just yesterday she hired a lawyer to help her bring this information forth because these text messages specifically say Brett they say Brett wanted me Karen her friend to speak out to refute the claims then she says Brett steamed Brett's guy are trying to get her to do other things I had to hand over this photo to Brett's team for instance so clearly she is naming Brett by person by himself personally and his quote unquote team that was trying to collect this information to essentially undercut Ramirez's story before it came out and so Heidi as of now as of 10:00 p.m. any contact with the FBI about this nope so I've been in contact with my source all day of course in the course of today it was reported the White House is now ordering the FBI to expand its investigation but Lawrence this is a very much an open question as to whether this tight-knit group of Yale University students who know Brett cavernous so well is ever going to be questioned in the course of this very short investigation if there are text messages that exist between these two women there could potentially be a whole stream of text messages as well between Brett Kavanaugh and his close male friends as well who could have been witnesses to this alleged incident Ron Klain Carrie Bertram a partner in a major law firm trying to make contact with the FBI about this investigation and she can't get through to the FBI with this information about these texts which appear to indicate Brett Kavanaugh had an awareness that there was an accusation coming for some reason he knew there'd be some kind of accusation coming from Deborah Ramirez before he read it in The New Yorker and that's a contradiction of his under oath testimony that's right Lauren said I mean I think we've seen this all over today I saw multiple people on Twitter saying hey I have information about Brett kavanah the FBI won't call me hey I can confirm what people were saying about his behavior at Yale the FBI won't call me I mean I think we're gonna see whether or not FBI stands for fake background investigation because you know we know that's what the White House was trying to get done they were trying to just do barely enough to satisfy senator flakes senator Collins and they got called on it today and so may they've loosened the reins we don't really know we don't know how much the FBI is gonna do we do know that there are people literally holding up red flags saying please FBI call me and they aren't getting called and so you know this is gonna play out over the next three days now people have said this can't be done in this short period of time the FBI has to do very little but in 1991 the Judiciary Committee heard from 22 witnesses in three days of public testimony on anita hill so the FBI can contact all these people they can get it done by the deadline if need be and there's no excuse for not doing a full investigation barb McQuaid James Comey wrote a kind of surprisingly confident op-ed piece about what the FBI could do in this investigation even in a limited version of the investigation as it was first understood to be if the investigation is unhindered and if the FBI is allowed to follow the leads as it finds them as a former federal prosecutor working with FBI agents what do you believe the FBI is capable of well they're capable of incredible things you know they can surge a lot of agents to interview all of these people in very short order but what's artificial about it in the phrase of Jim Comey putting a shot clock on the FBI does not advance the interests of the the quest for the truth here because what you would ideally do is interview people in order you would talk to some people and then with that information you would use that information to find other people and ask follow-up questions of them instead what you probably have to do is assign dozens of agents to go out simultaneously to conduct the interviews and then come back so you don't get a chance to say I heard X what do you say about X if so-and-so said why would you believe they were lying you don't get the opportunity to sort of have that whole picture and so I think that does cause some problems no doubt they can get out and talk to all these people in a week but if you've got hundreds or dozens of agents doing it do you really have that comprehensive look that would be ideal and Heidi it seems that reporters like you and the New York Times are out there uncovering things before the FBI certainly the information that you've uncovered about these texts is something we know the FBI has not dealt with beef or you have because the people involved have tried to reach the FBI I can say definitively that my source Kari Bertram is among the people who actually did not want to have to go to the media and she in fact she didn't go to the media I obtained her memo that went to the FBI through other means but it was when I came to her and said look I have this information of these texts that you outlined will you please come forward that she did say to us in a statement that you know this this is something that needs to be looked into and she's essentially having to come out now because it's the media that's coming to her not the FBI I was in contact with her Lawrence just a couple of hours ago and she said hey I'm on try number three now they referred me to a field office I called the field office and they said we don't take that kind of information and run the New York Times reporting tonight that police report indicates that Brett Kavanaugh was indeed in a bar fight at Yale that corroborates a description of a bar fight a given the day before by his former roommate of a former of Yale varsity basketball player the the journalists at times Heidi and NBC News are finding the things that the FBI should be getting to first well they are and it does raise a question of how thorough the first background investigation was that's water under the bridge now it needs to be thorough now and I'm gonna say something it's kind of unpopular which is at the end of this week they really should have another hearing and bring Brett Kavanaugh back in because what's really stacking up Lawrence is a series of statements he made at the last hearing that these subsequent revelations are showing to be untrue or arguably unsure at least the stuff in the texts that Heidi uncovered this issue about the bar fight all the people yells say he was a bludger chunk and really in the end the FBI should create a record of these facts and then he should be brought back under oath to explain the contradictions between his testimony and what seems to be developing as this investigation unfolds barbar it seems that question tonight is how much perjury is too much perjury by Brett Kavanaugh and of course the prosecutors normally treat perjury to be some it has to be serious it has to be a material fact if you if you you know didn't tell the truth about you know what shoes you were wearing that day and that's not really a material fact in the case it's no big deal but the the things that Brett Kavanaugh is being challenged on on credibility do they sound like material facts to you for example did you ever get blackout drunk did you ever pass out drunk in high school or college did you get aggressive and belligerent while drunk which is it seems to be relevant to is the accusation against him at Yale Republicans trying to say you know this is a the Democrats have now turned to high school drinking as if that's an issue but when we've had under oath testimony about high school drinking and high school drinking involved in a sexual assault that seems to be in the strike zone of perjury yet proving perjury can be very difficult because you have to prove as you said that it's a material fact not some detail about what was meant by high school slang in a yearbook for example but perhaps the question about whether you were ever blackout drunk the other thing you have to prove is that the person then and there knew that what they were saying was false if he never remembers being blackout drunk because he was blacked out then he may not have been and they're known that the statement was false but I think what's more important is regardless of whether you can bring a criminal case against him for perjury which seems unlikely to me the question is is this someone who lies and assembles this is someone to be an officer of the court to preside over the United States Supreme Court this should be someone whose integrity is beyond reproach and if we have caught him minimizing and assembling is this someone we want on the highest court in the land and does that instead demonstrate the kinds of things that background check is designed to ferret out which is is this person suitable for this job ordinarily all of this stuff is done in background not on public display and so when you do find discomfort with someone's answers or their past they quietly go away and you move on to the next candidate and you say hey he made the shortlist isn't that great instead we had this on full display but nonetheless regardless of who's to blame and the tribal politics what we want is a good Supreme Court justice and if we don't have that in Brett Kavanaugh we ought to move on to the candidate Heidi
