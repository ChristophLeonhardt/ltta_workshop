thousands of years Hindus have been performing the last funeral rites according to specific religious guidelines including burning the dead cremation is the traditional method of disposing of the deceased but with 8.5 million Hindus dying each year funeral pyres exact a huge and mine mental toll felling over 50 million trees emitting 8 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air and adding to India's already critical air pollution problem but here in Delhi a team of environmentally conscious engineers has adapted this age-old tradition of cremation to today's needs to protect the environment Mogambo crematorium is the oldest and most sacred of Delhi's 375 open-air cremation sites or gods it's also the busiest cremating about 70 bodies per day it's sinking in now looking at all these burning bodies and immediately reminded of my own grandmother's passing last year brings up a lot of raw emotions that go with the passing of a loved one death is a difficult time for families and not particularly a moment when the environment is a primary concern but an organization called moxtra is trying to change all that you must be unsure yeah uncle Gard is an executive officer at the NGO when cremation is about to start they have just done a mahogany the initial lighting up of the pyre and how long does it keep up it takes about minimum 5 to 6 hours 5 to 6 hours I can see your eyes are watering yeah because of the the pollution and you can see it's totally dark smoke yeah really dark so this is the actual pollutant I see there is a little bit more activity now see now the chief mourner or the son he will do the most important part of the cremation process he will take this bamboo and he will hit the head of the dead person that is called Kapil kriya to give salvation to the deceased person everything is part of this time-honored tradition the gods in the open air the mourners gathered around the body even the use of wood is significant but it's also a major contributor to the environmental problem all of this is the wood that they've gathered here which gets chopped up into smaller pieces as the day goes on and as they get orders and as body start coming in they have this massive warehouse here which is full of wood is kuwaiti a charge Tsukiji hang a family just arrived with the deceased and I'm told they purchased the cartload full of wood which was 400 kgs 400 is here and then this is the change but then make it collected you're telling yourself hoora put it in my eldest around 200 quintals which is 20,000 kilos of wood goes through this area I just cannot begin to imagine the magnitude of the problem facing us when you extrapolate this to the rest of India no wonder our forests are disappearing as early as the 1960s the Indian government recognized the environmental impact of cremation and they tried to address the problem by introducing an alternative method so this is the CNG of gas based crematorium trolleys to put the body inside this type of cremation only cost 10 dollars which is less than half the cost of a traditional one even still there are few takers the main problem is the people cannot perform the rituals there is no use of wood and once the body is sent inside you can't do anything you just have to sit like this and after two hours or three hours you can take the ashes and then you can go back I mean I have to say this place looks really grim and industrial there's nothing absolutely nothing traditional about this even with the best government-subsidized intentions gas and other forms of more environmentally friendly methods of cremation haven't caught on dr. Ravi Singh a sociologist of funerary rituals has some thoughts on the subject why is cremation such an important element in Hindu tradition it comes from the scriptures one of the most important and central ways to sort of think of cremation is to begin to think about the dead person himself or herself participating in the ritual as our sacrifice we've seen wood being used in the cremation at this site is that an important and integral part of cremation as well in the Hindu tradition yes so would generically is very significant the pyre is an aesthetic that is seen with a certain degree of grace so that would explain the reluctance that Hindus exhibit in trying and adopting alternative ways of cremating I would think that it is part of a certain kind of orthopraxy that you you do what are you have been doing and this is very difficult to shed in case of death rituals University Indians might be resistant to change when it comes to saying goodbye to loved ones but the environmental impact of cremation can no longer be ignored as India's population approaches a staggering 1.3 billion more deaths and more cremations only spell further environmental problems for the living this is why most are unsure the organization has come up with a more ecologically friendly system which balances the environment with tradition instead of 400 kgs in a conventional using less wood also means this system costs less than a traditional cremation does this method allow for the traditional rituals to be performed the same way as a conventional fire might yes definitely this system we are using only good and whatever things people generally use in a conventional system only so there is no deviation in the rituals which we follow now that the body is in there it's work on two basic principles of science we have increased the combustion efficiency by providing proper air that is through the chimney and the hood so when more oxygen is coming in the combustion efficiency increases so it increase your heat energy in this the cremation process gets over within two hours MOOC star system has been around for 15 years a tiny amount of time when it comes to taking on a centuries-old tradition but Mona's are now beginning to consider it seriously promote has just cremated his father Archer to Toronto Cola rocky young ESL rocky versus other year better than a christian lacroix community or apply some federal say 30 solar hostel eco cremation pyres currently host up to seven cremations a day at this site it's still much less than the traditional ones but unchilled plans to open 60 more sites in ten Indian cinema it's really brought it home to me that the balance between sensitivity to death loss and tradition and the immediacy for the need to protect the environment is a rather delicate one as someone who cares about the environment deeply myself I know we have a long way to go however it also hardens me to find groups such as moksha who are finding alternatives that are starting to have real impact you
