>> THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE WE
SEEK FROM DIPLOMACY WITH
NORTH KOREA HAS NOT CHANGED.
THE COMPLETE AND VERIFIABLE AND
IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION OF
THE KOREAN PENINSULA IS THE ONLY
OUTCOME THAT THE UNITED STATES
WILL ACCEPT.
I CAN ONLY SAY THIS.
WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE WHAT
WILL BE SECURED A SYRINGES THAT
ARE DIFFERENT, UNIQUE, THAT HAVE
BEEN PROVIDED -- THAT AMERICA
HAS BEEN WILLING TO PROVIDE
PREVIOUSLY.
WE THINK THIS IS BOTH NECESSARY
AND APPROPRIATE.
>> Bret: PRETTY CUT AND DRY,
SECRETARY POMPEO TALKING TO
REPORTERS OVERNIGHT.
JUST TWO HOURS FROM NOW THE TWO
LEADERS WILL MEET NOT FAR FROM
HERE.
IT LET'S BRING IN A PANEL.
JOSH LETTERMAN IS FOREMAN
AFFAIRS REPORTERS FOR THE
ASSOCIATED PRESS AND ALISHA,
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
FOR PEOPLE AT HOME, I WANT TO
PAINT THE ATMOSPHERE, THE STUFF
THAT THEY DON'T REALLY GET TO
SEE ON THE GROUND AND PAINT THE
PICTURE AS YOU ARE SEEING.
FIRST TO YOU.
>> SINGAPORE IS ALREADY ONE OF
THE CLEANEST MOST ORGANIZED
SOUTHEAST ASIAN CITY STATE
THEORY AND SECURITY HAS BEEN
RATHER TIGHT ALL WEEKEND LEADING
UP INTO THE SUMMIT.
THERE HAS BEEN A CERTAIN
EXCITEMENT IN THE AIR HERE IN
SINGAPORE OF ONLOOKERS PULLED
OUT THEIR iPHONE CAMERAS AS
KIM JONG UN'S MOTORCADE PASSED
BY NOT JUST WHEN HE ARRIVED, BUT
ALSO WHEN HE WENT ON A LITTLE
SIGHTSEEING TRIP LAST NIGHT.
>> Bret: HERE SOME VIDEO OF
THAT.
>> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY
WHO HAS BEEN CONSIDERED THE
MURDEROUS DICTATOR OF A PARIAH
STATE GOING OUT SIGHTSEEING AT
SOME OF THE TOP PLACES TO SEE IN
SINGAPORE.
HE WENT TO A BOTANICAL GARDEN
AND HE TOOK A SELFIE WITH THE
FOREIGN MINISTER OF SINGAPORE
AND OUT OF THAT HE THEN WENT TO
MARINA BAY SANDS, THE ICONIC
THREE TOWERS THAT YOU OFTEN SEE
IN SINGAPORE SKYLINE SHOTS.
KIM JONG UN ON, JUST NINE OR TEN
HOURS OUT FROM THIS BIG HIGH
STAKES SUMMIT DECIDED TO TAKE A
LITTLE LOOK OUT.
>> Bret: IT IS A LITTLE
SURREAL IN THAT ASPECT.
>> IT IS.
THE SENSE ON THE GROUND IS THE
CALM BEFORE THE STORM.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS HOTEL,
KIM JONG UN LESS THAN A MILE
AWAY AT HIS HOTEL, BOTH IN THEIR
OWN WORLDS HUDDLED WITH THEIR
AIDES PREPARING FOR WHAT IS
LIKELY THE LARGEST MOST
IMPORTANT DIPLOMATIC MEETING OF
THEIR LIVES AND A LOT OF
MACHINATIONS ON BOTH SIDE WITH
TRUMP RESCHEDULING HIS DEPARTURE
TO LEAVE ABOUT 15 HOURS EARLIER
THAN ANTICIPATED AND A LOT OF
SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY
THAT MEANS FOR THE SUMMIT WE ARE
HEADING INTO.
>> Bret: WE ARE ALL TRYING TO
READ THROUGH THE TEA LEAVES
HERE.
WE TRY IN THE PRESS TO PRESS
SECRETARY POMPEO FOR SPECIFICS.
HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO
NEGOTIATE WITH THE MEDIA AND
HERE IS AN INTERESTING
SOUND BITE ABOUT VERIFICATION,
THE B WORD.
>> THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN
FOOLED BEFORE, THERE'S NO DOUBT
ABOUT IT.
MANY PRESIDENTS PREVIOUSLY HAVE
SIGNED OFF ON PIECES OF PAPER
ONLY TO FIND THAT THE
NORTH KOREANS EITHER DIDN'T
PROMISE WHAT WE THOUGHT THEY HAD
OR ACTUALLY RENEGED ON THEIR
PROMISES.
THE V MATTERS.
WE ARE GOING TO ENSURE THAT WE
SET UP A SYSTEM SUFFICIENTLY
ROBUST THAT WE ARE ABLE TO
VERIFY THESE OUTCOMES AND IT'S
ONLY ONCE THE V HAPPENS THAT WE
WILL PROCEED APACE.
>> Bret: HEARD THAT FROM A BUT
ELISE, WE ARE TRYING TO GET
SPECIFICS.
HOW DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING
TO RESPOND EITHER WAY?
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT COUPLE
OF HOURS?
>> THE GOAL IS TO KNOW WHERE ALL
OF NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR
FACILITIES ARE.
FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THERE
ARE A LOT OF SECRET SITES, WHAT
IS GOING ON UNDERGROUND.
RIGHT NOW NOT ONLY ARE OUTSIDE
INSPECTORS NOT KNOWLEDGEABLE
INSPECTORS
ABOUT IT, BUT OTHER
NATION-STATES ABOUT WHAT'S GOING
ON NUCEARIZED IN NORTH KOREA.
THERE IS GOING TO BE A PUSH TO
TRY TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF
WHERE EXACTLY ALL THE SITES ARE,
WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS THAT
MAKE UP NORTH KOREA'S ARSENAL
AND TO GET IN OUTSIDE ACTUAL
IAEA INSPECTORS.
>> Bret: WAS ALL THE TROUBLES
WITH IRAN AND IRAQ AND ALL OF
THE VERIFICATION PROCESSES.
JOSH, THE ADMINISTRATION IS
SUGGESTING THEY ARE NOT GETTING
ENOUGH CREDIT FOR JUST BEING
HERE, THAT ALREADY THE CRITICS
ARE TURNING AND SAYING WHAT'S
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OUT OF THIS
MEETING AS OPPOSED TO WHAT IS
HAPPENING CURRENTLY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, BUT ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT A LOT OF A LOT OF
LONGTIME NORTH KOREAN MARCHERS
HAVE POINTED OUT IS THAT THIS IS
A SUMMIT THAT REALLY WOULD HAVE
BEEN AVAILABLE TO ANY U.S.
PRESIDENT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL
DECADES THAT WANTED IT.
THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE BEEN VERY
EAGER TO HAVE THIS TYPE OF
MEETING, BUT PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS
THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS NOT WISE
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SEE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE KIND OF
CONCRETE PROGRESS EMANATE FROM
IT THAT THEY WANTED.
REALLY THE KEY QUESTION AS WE
HEAD INTO THE SUMMIT IS WILL IT
BE MORE THAN A HANDSHAKE?
WILL THERE BE SOMETHING
SUBSTANTIVE, CONCRETE THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABLE TO SHOW
AND IF NOT, HOW DOES HE DEFEND
THE RISK THAT HE TOOK WITH DOING
THIS?
>> Bret: 30 SECONDS, WHAT IS
THE LEADING EARLY TELL US, DOES
IT TELL US ANYTHING?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
KIM JONG UN IS REPORTEDLY
LEAVING QUITE EARLY AS WELL TO
RETURN TO PYONGYANG SO THERE
COULD BE SOMETHING ABOUT
SIGNALING NOT TRYING TO LEAVE
TOO FAR AFTER KIM JONG UN LEADS,
SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE.
>> Bret: OBVIOUSLY HE DOESN'T
WANT TO BE OUT OF THE COUNTRY
TOO LONG.
HE'S WORRIED ABOUT HIS OWN
STATUS.
>> THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN
INDICATIONS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE
IS TRYING TO LOWER EXPECTATIONS
AS IT HAS HEADED INTO THIS.
GONE ARE THE TALKS FROM JUST A
FEW DAYS AGO THAT MAYBE WE COULD
STRIKE AN END TO THE KOREAN WAR,
MAYBE WE COULD ACTUALLY GET A
NUCLEAR DEAL HERE.
NOW WE ARE POMPEO SAYING
HOPEFULLY WE WILL GO INTO THIS
LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR MORE
FUTURE SUCCESSFUL MEETINGS, SO
THERE'S A SENSE THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION HAS A FEELING
THAT THIS MAY NOT BE AS BIG AS
THEY WANTED TO BE AND DOESN'T
