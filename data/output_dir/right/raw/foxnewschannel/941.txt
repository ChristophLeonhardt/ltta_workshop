1
00:00:00,348 --> 00:00:01,583
HILARIOUS APOLOGY TO THE PEOPLE

2
00:00:01,583 --> 00:00:01,950
OF CANADA.

3
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,219
>> I'M GOING TO SAY ONE THING.

4
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:06,988
[BLEEP] TRUMP.

5
00:00:06,988 --> 00:00:10,559
I JUST WANT TO MAKE A NOTE OF

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,394
APOLOGY FOR THE IDIOTIC BEHAVIOR

7
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:17,566
OF MY PRESIDENT AND I APOLOGIZE

8
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:19,367
TO JUSTIN TRUDEAU AND THE OTHER

9
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:19,868
PEOPLE AT THE G7.

10
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:24,139
IT'S DISGUSTING.

11
00:00:24,139 --> 00:00:25,774
>> Tucker: A LOT OF PEOPLE GET

12
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:27,209
DEEPER AND MORE THOUGHTFUL AS

13
00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:28,577
THEY GET OLDER.

14
00:00:28,577 --> 00:00:29,911
NOT THE CASE WITH ROBERT DE NIRO

15
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:31,613
BUT HE'S GETTING SUPPORT FROM

16
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:32,180
HOLLYWOOD.

17
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,750
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR AMERICAN

18
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,117
POLITICS?

19
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:37,385
DOES THE IMAGE OF RICH ACTORS

20
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:38,620
SWEARING AT THE PRESIDENT AT AN

21
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,756
ORANGE SHOW HELP THE PRESIDENT

22
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:42,824
OR HURT HIM?

23
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:47,562
JOE PISCOPO JOINS US FROM THE

24
00:00:47,562 --> 00:00:50,165
STREETS OF THE METROPOLIS OF

25
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:50,799
8 MILLION.

26
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,435
>> GREAT TO SEE YOU FROM THE

27
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:57,205
BRONX, NEW YORK.

28
00:00:57,205 --> 00:00:59,407
OUR LADY OF MOUNT CARAMEL.

29
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:00,976
ST. ANTHONY FESTIVAL.

30
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:04,913
I'M GETTING MY BLESSINGS.

31
00:01:04,913 --> 00:01:06,748
GOD BLESS YOU, MY SON.

32
00:01:06,748 --> 00:01:09,584
OR WHAT EFFECT DOES THIS HAVE ON

33
00:01:09,584 --> 00:01:12,187
NORMAL PEOPLE, DO YOU THINK?

34
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:15,590
WHO WEREN'T IN THE AUDIENCE OR

35
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,491
AREN'T "HUFFINGTON POST" CHARTER

36
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:16,992
SUBSCRIBERS.

37
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:20,028
HOW DO THEY REACT TO ROBERT

38
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:21,797
DE NIRO'S SPEECH?

39
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:22,664
HIS 2-WORD SPEECH?

40
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:27,369
>> FROM THE STREETS OF THE BRONX

41
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:28,370
HERE, A GREAT ITALIAN-AMERICAN

42
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,138
COMMUNITY, WE IDOLIZE ROBERT

43
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:30,605
DE NIRO.

44
00:01:30,605 --> 00:01:31,339
GREAT RESPECT FOR THE BRILLIANCE

45
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:33,275
OF ROBERT DE NIRO BUT TO GO ON

46
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:36,678
LIVE TELEVISION.

47
00:01:36,678 --> 00:01:37,212
HE'S FROM NEW YORK.

48
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:41,116
I'M TELLING YOU THIS WILL ENSURE

49
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:44,186
DONALD TRUMP'S ELECTION IN 2020.

50
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:45,921
TO BE THAT REPREHENSIBLE AND TO

51
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:48,223
BE THAT VULGAR ON LIVE

52
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:49,591
TELEVISION.

53
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:50,292
AGAIN, I HAVE IMMENSE RESPECT

54
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:53,628
FOR THIS MAN, BUT IT WILL

55
00:01:53,628 --> 00:01:56,031
RESONATE WITH THE UNITED STATES.

56
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:57,833
WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE, YOU

57
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:00,368
HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT FOR.

58
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:02,037
THE G7 SUMMIT WAS A NEGOTIATION.

59
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:05,173
THE PRESIDENT SAID --

60
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:06,208
IT'S A NEGOTIATION.

61
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,577
THEN HE SITS DOWN WITH

62
00:02:08,577 --> 00:02:10,377
KIM JONG UN, IT'S MONUMENTAL.

63
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:11,246
IT'S EPIC, HISTORIC.

64
00:02:11,246 --> 00:02:13,782
THE COUNTRIES EMBRACING IT, AND

65
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:14,983
NORTH KOREA IS EMBRACING IT.

66
00:02:14,983 --> 00:02:16,685
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PEACE HERE,

67
00:02:16,685 --> 00:02:19,187
AND TO GET ONE OF YOUR HEROES TO

68
00:02:19,187 --> 00:02:22,090
BE THAT VULGAR ON LIVE

69
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,892
TELEVISION, TUCKER, IT DOESN'T

70
00:02:23,892 --> 00:02:26,228
PLAY ACROSS THE REST OF THE

71
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:26,661
UNITED STATES.

72
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:28,430
>> Tucker: IT'S A WEIRD

73
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:28,797
RESPONSE.

74
00:02:28,797 --> 00:02:30,699
ISN'T THE ARGUMENT AGAINST TRUMP

75
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:31,633
THAT HE'S VULGAR?

76
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:34,402
IT'S HARD TO MAKE THAT ARGUMENT

77
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:36,204
IF I AM SCREAMING F TRUMP AT AN

78
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:36,872
AWARDS SHOW.

79
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:40,175
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

80
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:42,978
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF BOBBY

81
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:45,280
DE NIRO CAUGHT UP THERE AND SAID

82
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,181
I HEARD THINGS.

83
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:47,582
I HEARD SOME THINGS.

84
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:48,583
I HEARD THINGS.

85
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,785
HE COULD HAVE FUN WITH IT.

86
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:54,789
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?

87
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:55,557
THE BRILLIANCE OF BROADWAY, THE

88
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:57,626
GREATEST ENTERTAINERS IN THE

89
00:02:57,626 --> 00:02:59,628
WORLD ON THE GREAT WHITE WAY.

90
00:02:59,628 --> 00:03:01,730
THE BRILLIANCE OF BROADWAY

91
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,297
TALENTS.

92
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:06,101
TO TAKE THAT SHOWED THAT LEVEL,

93
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:08,570
IT WAS VERY, VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

94
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,305
AND I AM BEING POLITE.

95
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:11,406
>> Tucker: ESPECIALLY SINCE HE

96
00:03:11,406 --> 00:00:00,000
HAS MADE SO MANY GREAT MOVIES.
