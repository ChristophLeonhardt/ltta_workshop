1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,019
DURING MICHAEL WOLFF'S
INTERVIEW WITH THE TODAY SHOW HE

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,320
TALKED ABOUT VARIOUS CONCERNS
AND CHRIS'S HIM THAT WHITE HOUSE

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,300
STAFF HAD, INCLUDING HOW
INCREDIBLY -- HOW MUCH HE LACKS

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,060
INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,831
LET'S HEAR FROM MICHAEL WOLFF
HIMSELF ON THE ISSUE.

6
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:23,100
>>YOU SAID THESE SENIOR PEOPLE
INSULT HIS INTELLIGENCE.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,470
WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS
PEOPLE WOULD SAY?

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,378
>>THEY SAY HE IS A MORON, AN
IDIOT, ACTUALLY THERE'S A

9
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:37,660
COMPETITION TO SORT OF GET TO
THE BOTTOM LINE HERE OF WHO THIS

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,710
MAN IS.

11
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:45,680
LET'S REMEMBER, THIS MAN
DOES NOT READ, DOES NOT LISTEN.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,230
HE'S LIKE A PINBALL JUST
SHOOTING OFF THE SIDE.

13
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,020
>>AGAIN, THAT IS ANOTHER PORTION
OF HIS BOOK THAT I THINK HAS

14
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,700
BEEN -- IT REINFORCES STUFF WE
ALREADY KNEW, BECAUSE WE KNEW

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,340
TRUMP DIDN'T LIKE THE
INTELLIGENCE BRIEFINGS, WE KNEW

16
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,690
PEOPLE HAD TO GIVE HIM BRIEFINGS
IN TINY SPURTS BECAUSE THEY

17
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,690
COULDN'T GET HIS ATTENTION FOR
LONG PERIODS OF TIME ON

18
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,970
IMPORTANT ISSUES.

19
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,150
SO THIS BOOK
IN MY OPINION KIND OF REINFORCES

20
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,710
THOSE ELEMENTS OF TRUMP THAT WE
ALREADY HAD LEARNED ABOUT.

21
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,180
>>AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
HAVE, I'VE NOT READ THE BOOK

22
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,460
YET, BUT EVERYTHING I HAVE HEARD
ABOUT IT IS EXACTLY WHAT I

23
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,690
EXPECT WHEN I DO READ IT, AND
YOU WILL REMEMBER HE GAVE A

24
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,010
PRESS CONFERENCE ON REPEAL AND
REPLACE, HE SAID WE WILL GET

25
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,500
THIS DONE, SOMEBODY ASKED HIM
WHAT HE WANTS TO CHANGE, AND HE

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,500
HAD NO CLUE.

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,180
HE HADN'T READ THE
HEALTHCARE BILL, HE DIDN'T KNOW

28
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,380
WHAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS
OTHER THAN THAT HE CALLED IT

29
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,990
OBAMACARE AND THAT WAS ENOUGH
FOR HIM, SO THAT'S CHILDLIKE.

30
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,990
IF

31
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,700
YOU LOOK AT HIS ENTIRE
ADMINISTRATION, IT'S REINFORCED

32
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,020
IN THESE PAGES.

33
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:09,949
>>LET ME DISAGREE WITH PART OF
WHAT YOU SAID, THERE IS 

34
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,949
NO WAY

35
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,750
IT WILL BE FOUR YEARS.

36
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:22,700
HIS
DEMISE IS SPEEDING UP, IT'S

37
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,610
BECOME KIND OF IRREFUTABLE.

38
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,970
WHEN
WE TALK ABOUT WHAT THE BOOK

39
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:39,130
SAYS, I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET
THE WRONG IMPRESSION.

40
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,130
BUT A

41
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,580
TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO
WORK AT THE WHITE HOUSE,

42
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:51,370
SOURCES, PEOPLE 
CLOSEST TO TRUMP

43
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,401
WHO WORK WITH HIM EVERY DAY, SAY

44
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:57,530
THESE THINGS ABOUT HIM. AND TO
ME THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, YES

45
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:14,280
HE'S NOT BRIGHT, WE KNOW THAT,
BUT HE SAID HE DOESN'T READ AND

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,870
DOESN'T LISTEN.

47
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,950
BUT FOCUS ON
THIS FOR A SECOND, IF YOU HAVE

48
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,500
THE MOST POWERFUL MAN ON EARTH,
IN CHARGE OF THE COUNTRY,

49
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,040
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
AND HE REFUSES TO LEARN

50
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,780
ANYTHING -- HE NEVER WORKED IN
POLITICS SO HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT

51
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,140
THE NUCLEAR TRIAD IS AND DOESN'T
WANT TO.

52
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,350
ANYONE THINKS HE KNOWS

53
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,800
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SUNNI
MUSLIM AND THE SHIITE MUSLIM?

54
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,780
AND THAT MAKES ALL THE
DIFFERENCE IN THE SAUDI

55
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,110
ARABIA/IRAN CONFLICT, BUT HE
DOESN'T KNOW IT AND NEVER WILL

56
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,540
AND WON'T LEARN IT, AND HE
DOESN'T EVEN LISTEN, BECAUSE IF

57
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,020
YOU AREN'T SAYING THE WORD TRUMP
HE DOESN'T CARE.

58
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,020
TO HAVE SOMEONE

59
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,240
THAT INDIFFERENT TO THE FATE
OF OUR COUNTRY AND THE

60
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,660
POLICIES WE HAVE ISN'T READILY
DANGEROUS.

61
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,010
>>YOU WANT THE LEADER OF THE
COUNTRY TO MAKE INFORMED POLICY

62
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,240
DECISIONS, AND IF HE'S NOT
WILLING TO LISTEN TO ANY

63
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,399
INFORMATION, THEN HE'S NOT GOING
TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS.

64
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,399
BUT

65
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,840
LOOK, ALL OF THIS STUFF KEEPS
REMINDING ME OF STORIES THAT WE

66
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,850
HAVE DONE RECENTLY.

67
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,930
REMEMBER,
THE BIG STORY, I BELIEVE IT WAS

68
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,391
LAST WEEK, WAS THE FACT THAT A
NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER GOT AN

69
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:34,720
IMPROMPTU INTERVIEW WITH TRUMP
AND DURING THAT INTERVIEW, TRUMP

70
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,530
FELT THE NEED TO SAY THAT HE
UNDERSTANDS ALL THE BIG BILLS.

71
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,280
HE KNOWS THE BIG BILLS BETTER
THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN U.S.

72
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
HISTORY.

73
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,780
AND THE FACT THAT HE
FELT THE NEED TO SAY THAT, AND

74
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,570
MENTIONED THAT IN THE INTERVIEW,
I THINK IS ALSO TELLING.

75
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,570
HE IS

76
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,470
OBVIOUSLY INSECURE ABOUT HOW
MUCH HE KNOWS ABOUT THE

77
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,060
LEGISLATION HE'S TOUTING AND
LOOSELY.

78
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,050
>>IT'S LIKE THE KID IN HIGH
SCHOOL WHO SCREAMS OUT, I'M NOT

79
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,550
GAY!

80
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,490
NOBODY ASKED YOU, WHY DID
YOU SAY THAT?

81
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,000
OR THE KID IN THE

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,590
OVAL OFFICE WHO SAYS I HAVE A
BIG BUTTON, BIGGER THAN YOURS,

83
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,860
AND IT DEFINITELY WORKS.

84
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,340
THERE
IS SOMETHING YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY

85
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,340
INSECURE ABOUT.

86
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:18,640
CAN YOU IMAGINE
IF OBAMA OR CLINTON, OR REAGAN,

87
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,110
HAD SAID I KNOW ALL THE BILLS, I
KNOW THE BIG BILLS BETTER THAN

88
00:05:22,110 --> 00:00:00,000
ANYONE.
