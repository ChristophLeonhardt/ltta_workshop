Hi, I’m Steven S.
DeKnight, director
of “Pacific Rim Uprising."
"Warning."
All right.
So here we are in Sydney,
where we have the introduction
of Obsidian Fury.
We wanted the introduction
of this rogue Jaeger
to be as spectacular
as we could make it.
So we picked the Sydney
Opera House as a backdrop.
"Gipsy: This is command.
Be advised that we
have a rogue Jaeger."
As Obsidian Fury
walks past that
cruise ship, that’s
actually right
outside my hotel room
that I spent the entire time in.
This part right here, where
the holographic missile
goes through the
Conn-Pod, we really
wanted in this next
installment of the movie
to take the outside and make
it interact with the inside
so it didn’t feel like you were
cutting inside a completely
separate room, that it was very
organic and very connected.
Here I had to
disable Gipsy briefly
to give Obsidian Fury a
chance to destroy those guns
and target Mako.
At one point, there was a
much more involved back story
of what Mako was doing,
that she was actually
vetting the drone
program, traveling around
the world making sure
everything was all right
before she gave her approval.
That got very much streamlined
as the story continued
and then we pared it down.
This entire action sequence,
we really went back and forth
and did a lot of work
with the visual effects
team, Double Negative,
and my visual effects
supervisor Peter Chiang.
In this exchange right
here, this first exchange
is something D Neg pitched.
And I thought it was fantastic.
D Neg also pitched
this chest canon
that Obsidian Fury
uses, which I thought
was a very, very cool idea.
And I wanted to
give Obsidian Fury
a couple of brutal,
intimidating weapons.
So we came up with this
idea of plasma chainsaws.
So that it’s just not a sword,
but an actual chainsaw.
We shot all of this
on location in Sydney.
Including the stuff inside
the Conn-Pod was also at Fox
Studios in Sydney.
This idea right here,
slicing a building in half
with a chainsaw, was
actually Mary Parent’s idea,
the producer.
She wanted to see
something that we
hadn’t seen in the
first movie and pitched
this idea of cutting a building
in half, which I loved.
It was not a cheap bit.
So it was great that it
actually came from a producer.
Mako’s helicopter
getting hit was
something I had pitched
from the beginning.
Gipsy’s gravity sling
was another weapon.
We wanted all the
Yeager’s to have
a Y button, a special ability.
We wanted to give Gipsy
a really cool upgrade.
So we came up with this
idea of a gravity sling.
