<font color="#E5E5E5">actually do better when we all start</font>

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,870
doing anything I would argue that we're

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing here for internal reasons which</font>

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,820
are also called intrinsic motivators

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,220
when I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> my blog 1,000 awesome</font>

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,230
things back in two thousand eight I did

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I want to cheer myself up but</font>

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,760

15
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,239
ton of hits or none at all I started

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,790
using those numbers as a replacement for

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">my own intrinsic motivation those stat</font>

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,500
counters turned into bestseller lists

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,020
and rankings and hit counts and all

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,969
kinds of variables it's just like that

21
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,039
at work you get a performance review<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>
