and the double standard between the way Trump is reported on and the way Obama was reported on the way Democrats a reporter has now gotten so egregious that I feel like we could just do the whole show about this every single day do you have a picture of the president congratulating Putin there he is oh wait that's the wrong president that's Barack Obama shaking hands with here's the report from the time this is in March 11th the Russian people and international observers may not see last Sunday's presidential election in Russia as legitimate but President Barack Obama has now officially endorsed the return of Russian past and future President Vladimir Putin President Obama called Russian president-elect and Prime Minister Putin to congratulate him on his recent victory in the Russian presidential election President Obama highlighted achievements in us-russia relations over the past three years this is a statement from the White House over the past three years with President Medvedev including cooperation on Afghanistan the conclusion and ratification of the START agreement Obama told Putin he looked forward to Putin's mavis same statement the exhibit has been said exactly the same thing that Trump said now you can say oh yes but then we didn't know about the Russian medley ridiculous it's ridiculous you know the Russians have been meddling with our elections forever the only reason we know about it now is because Trump was elected yeah we even had this thing where he says Obama told Putin that we could benefit economically from Russians joining the World Trade Organization and this could be in a reference to the administration of the Obama administration's efforts to get Congress to repeal the 1974 jackson-vanik law that prevents the u.s. from giving Russia permanent normal trade status and that law did get repealed although it got repealed they also attached the Magnitsky act to it but it deal I mean you have to remember this that Obama was telling businessmen he was bringing businessmen to Russia to try and set the big read that big red reset button that Hillary Clinton did say you know I'm all I'm saying is is this you know Trump has been much tougher on Russia than Obama ever was he's imposed new sanctions on him he signed sanctions for their human rights abuses and he has continued to punish Russia with like oh gosh it's not all these things he's proved the largest sale of lethal defense weapons to the Ukrainian forces that's a big one right because that was something that Obama never did
