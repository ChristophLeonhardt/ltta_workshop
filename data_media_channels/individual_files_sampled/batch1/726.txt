in a center dedicated to cutting-edge design a speech meant to give Labour's brexit strategy a sharper outline Jeremy Corbyn supporters say there's now a clear difference between the government and opposition on this crucial issue so layman would seek to negotiate a new comprehensive UK EU customs union to ensure there are no tariffs with Europe and to help avoid any need whatsoever for a hard border in Northern Ireland but we're also clear that the option of a new UK customs union with the EU would need to ensure that the UK has a say in future trade deals a new customs arrangement would depend on Britain being able to negotiate agreement for new trade deals in our national interest the existing customs union means Britain enjoys tariff free trade with the 27 other European Union members up to now Jeremy Corbyn has simply promised to push for the exact same benefits believing anything more would infuriate the sizable number of labour voters who backed brexit it's no coincidence that Jeremy Corbyn gave this speech in a strongly leave voting area all along labour has said it must respect the views of it brexit backing supporters but now there has been a shift a significant one many people say and one that could change the future of Britain Downing Street has again rejected any customs union saying the UK must be free to strike its own trade deals but the Confederation of British industry welcomed Corbin's shift saying it would put jobs and living standards first at this Coventry engineering firm they make parts mainly for commercial vehicles and a fifth of their business is with other EU countries 18 people work here and the boss says any sudden break with the EU would be very damaging it something can be done to hold on to those sighs still give ourselves a chance to break free of the EU if that's what has to happen then so be it but beginning new trade deals with other countries can take years and years so I think there could be a lot of years of hurt before anything is then put back to normal on Friday Prime Minister Theresa May will give her brexit speech but she could face a rebellion in Parliament from some in her party who wants to retain closer links with the EU the fact that she doesn't have an overall majority means this move by labour could be significant when Parliament votes on brexit in the coming months Nadine Barber al Jazeera Coventry
