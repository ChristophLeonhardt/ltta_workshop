one of our slogans is actually meat-free
more often and we want to make sure that
actually people are aware that actually
you do not have to eat as much meat as
people usually consume and I think
everybody can agree that we don't need
to eat as much meat as we re in and so
we want to make sure that everybody has
an option that's still tasty although it
has the vegan label you can still taste
just as good virtually it would does
good for the planet it does good for
your health and it does good for the
wider environment
I can fly
you
