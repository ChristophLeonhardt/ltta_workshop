I don't understand why are we prioritizing the world's sickest people I mean I have nothing against sick people I just think if we're gonna have immigration surely we should choose the people that are in our interest because we're gonna have to say no to most of the world why don't we choose the best right I mean there's just so many problems as we're with this policy and with the general approach that the Trudeau government takes towards immigration so you know we're talking about people who are going to call it that the government considers will cost excessive burden on our social services and on our health services as we're this changed they're literally amending the definition of those words so that they can change this policy and raising the threshold that it doesn't really add up to like you know the point of our immigration system is supposed to be about boosting the economy boosting the number of workers who can pay for Canada's socialist health care services and our social welfare net and then at the same time material government now wants to bring in the world sickest people medias people not not for a refugee category but through our mainstream immigration program and the worst part of all of it esra was that in the committee the report that they produced it showed that the government had not done any estimates or any calculations as to how much this program will cost Canadians they don't know how much it will cost to administer it how much the changes will cost whether or not it will create a huge surge of people who are sick all over the world wanting to come to Canada for our free health care the government hasn't done any of that work they've just sort of clumsily introduced these changes hoping that no one will notice yeah I mean the the cost of catastrophic care of a heart transplant of a serious AIDS patient the medical care there are health problems that can cost a million dollars and and if we have a million dollars I suppose there's two ways we could spend it we could spend it on Canadians who are citizens who have the right to be here who have paid into the healthcare system or if we wanted to do good in the world we could give I don't hope foreign aid or we could choose as many Canadians foreigners as possible to benefit under some other system but to simply say bring from the seven billion people in the world this sick is people here and just drain all our money and I just don't even understand it I mean the world has an unlimited supply of illness and these people have no particular moral claims you say they're they're not even refugees like they're not even they're just sick and this is Ahmed hustlaz way of saying yeah free stuff in Canada provinces will pay for it yeah what's the rationale I don't even understand it because even if you wanted to do the most good possible this doesn't do that I just don't get it can this what's the rationale well I think this is a perfect example a perfect case of special interest groups in Ottawa lobbying the government you know a small narrow group of people pushing for their you know their clients are their you know their special interests getting the ear of liberal politicians in Ottawa and you notice the way that they announce this it was like it had been some social justice victory like after 40 years of one policy the government is now opening its doors to people who have disabilities and severe illnesses as if it was some kind of a breakthrough to celebrate well the reality is that most Canadians are pretty open to immigration in general but it's things like this esra that are clearly just taking advantage of our generosity that are gonna end up displacing Canadians you know Canadians elderly Canadians who have paid in the system paid taxes done exactly what they were supposed to do their entire lives you know just to fund this system and they're gonna show up to the emergency room and be displaced by someone who just got off a plane from somewhere isn't a Canadian but that's no longer a problem because our health care system apparently is open to life that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
