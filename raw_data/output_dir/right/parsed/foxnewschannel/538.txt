AINSLEY: YALE LAW PROFESSORS
CANCELING 31 CLASSES ON
MONDAY AS STUDENTS PROTESTED
JUDGE KAVANAUGH
CONFIRMATION.
ORGANIZERS CALL KAVANAUGH A
YALE LAW SCHOOL ALUM A REAL
THREAT TO THE COUNTRY.
IS THIS WHAT SHOULD BE
HAPPENING AT ONE OF THE
COUNTRY'S LEADING LAW
SCHOOLS.
HERE WITH INCITE IS EDITOR
AND CHIEF FOR CAMPUS REFORM
LAWRENCE JONES.
WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO
THIS?
>> FIRST THING WAS THESE ARE
LAW STUDENTS.
THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT
ARE GOING TO BE OUR NEXT
LAWYERS, JUSTICE, JURISTS.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND, BASED
ON THE PROFESSORS TEACHING
THEM ABOUT DUE PROCESS.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE
RIGHT TO FACE YOUR ACCUSER.
AINSLEY: INNOCENT UNTIL
GUILTY.
>> INNOCENCE UNTIL PROVEN
GUILTY.
THIS IS THE NONSENSE WE HAVE
BEEN INVESTIGATING ON CAMPUS
REFORM.COM CLEAR
INDOCTRINATION OF KIDS.
NOT JUST YALE, MISSISSIPPI
STATE.
STUDENTS THERE PROTESTING
WERE THE FACULTY MEMBERS AND
PROFESSORS.
THEY WANTED TO HAVE A MOMENT
OF SILENCE AND PRAY FOR THE
ACCUSED.
AINSLEY: WILL THEY NOW HAVE
CLASSES AND CANCEL CLASSES
FOR THOSE PEOPLE IN SUPPORT
OF BRETT KAVANAUGH.
>> THEY PROBABLY WON'T.
THIS IS DEFINITELY A
POLITICAL AGENDA AND THIS
REALLY IS CONSISTENT WITH
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING
ON AT CAMPUS REFORM ABOUT
WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE
COLLEGE CAMPUSES.
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN DUE
PROCESS.
REMEMBER THE UVA CASE AND
THE ROLLING STONES CASE.
THE RAPE ALLEGATIONS.
THEY RELEASED AN ARTICLE
WITHOUT DOING FACT CHECKING,
WITHOUT AN INVESTIGATION
AND, GUESS WHAT?
THEY GOT IT WRONG AND THEY
HAVE TO PAY THESE BOYS.
THIS IS A NARRATIVE THIS
HAPPENED ON THE COLLEGE
CAMPUS WHERE THEY DON'T WANT
THIS DUE PROCESS AND THEY
ARE DESTROYING OUR
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AS
AMERICANS.
AINSLEY: THIS IS WHAT YALE
LAW SCHOOL RELEASED.
INDIVIDUAL FACULTY
RESCHEDULED A NUMBER OF
CLASSES ON MONDAY IN ORDER
TO GIVE THE COMMUNITY TIME
TO HOW VISDZ AND GROUPINGS
COULD WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE
THEIR VOICES HEARD DURING
THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS.
>> THIS IS MOB RULE.
EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE
CONCERNED LEGISLATORS ARE
TAKING THEIR CUES FROM THE
COLLEGE CAMPUSES.
WE REPORTED ON THIS YEARS
AGO THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE
TO HAVE A TRIAL.
THEY WANT THIS TO BE TRIED
