00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,180
In October 2017, a bombing in Somalia’s
capital of Mogadishu killed and injured hundreds

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,280
of people, in what’s been called the world’s
deadliest terror attack in recent years.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,090
It was also the third terror attack in Mogadishu
in 2017, and at least the tenth bombing in

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,070
the past two years.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,810
Somalia has experienced mass death and political
instability for decades, so why is the country

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,439
such a target for terrorism?

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,960
Well, since 1991, and the start of the Somali
Civil War, Somalia has wavered between being

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,569
a fragile and outright failed state.

9
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:34,860
When the government of Siad Barre was overthrown
by a military junta, which was the same way

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,250
Barre came to power in 1969, the country fell
into a power vacuum.

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,160
Warring factions, led by religious and regional
clans fought to establish control over their

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,440
local territories, displacing and killing
hundreds of thousands of civilians.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,920
Most notable in this power struggle was the
rise of a group known as the Islamic Courts

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
Union.

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,670
Despite the best efforts of international
and neighboring states to establish a military

16
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:02,220
force and stable government in Somalia, the
ICU was able to capture and control a large

17
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,920
southern portion of the country.

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,759
In 2006, the capital Mogadishu fell to the
ICU, and the group quickly implemented their

19
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,220
version of Islamic Law.

20
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,229
Although by the end of that year, the ICU
were forced out of Mogadishu and disbanded

21
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:20,990
by the newly formed transitional government,
Somalia continued to spiral out of control.

22
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,450
In particular, an offshoot of the failed ICU
began gaining power and committing terror

23
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,969
attacks countrywide.

24
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,869
The group, called Al-Shabaab, has claimed
responsibility for multiple bombings, particularly

25
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:33,889
since 2012.

26
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:38,100
This al-Qaeda aligned Islamist group, named
after the Arabic word for “Youth” has

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,899
specifically targeted government institutions
and non-Muslims.

28
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:46,649
Al-Shabaab has sought to establish an Islamic
state within Somalia, not unlike ISIS or the

29
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:47,719
former ICU.

30
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:51,149
And while some sources report that the terror
group has lost ground since their formation

31
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,009
around 2008, they do still control major regions,
and have continued terrorizing the country.

32
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,590
In short, Somalia has seen a massive increase
in terrorist groups, and lawlessness since

33
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,279
the start of its civil war.

34
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:05,549
Al Shabaab represents only a small fraction
of the damage the country has undergone.

35
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,119
Without the support of neighboring countries,
which have seen violence spill past their

36
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,820
borders, Somalia would likely have no functioning
government at all.

37
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,260
With so many groups vying for control of an
impoverished and oppressed region, the terrorism

38
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,900
and turmoil Somali citizens have experienced
is unlikely to end anytime soon.

39
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,171
As Somalia continues to struggle with terrorism
and corruption, a region of the country is

40
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:27,640
still seeking independence.

41
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Somaliland is in the northern-most part of
the of the east african country and has been

42
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,020
struggling for it own sovereign nation for
years now.

43
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,950

becoming its own country, check out this video.
