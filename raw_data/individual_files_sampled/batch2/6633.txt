ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO THE BOSTON GLOBE DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN. NOW, MIND YOU, TWO YEARS AGO AS APRIL 10, 2016, AND THAT'S WHEN THEY RAN THIS. AT THAT POINT TRUMP HASN'T WON THE PRESIDENCY YET, EVERYONE STILL THINKS HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY, BUT HE OBVIOUSLY HAS HAD SOME FIERY RHETORIC ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, SO THEY DID A MOCKUP OF WHAT THE BOSTON GLOBE COULD LOOK LIKE UNDER THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT, HERE'S THE TWEET THAT BEGINS TO EXPLAIN IT, THEY SAY THEY TELL YOU TO LOOK AT THE DATE AND ALL THE HEADLINES BECAUSE THE FIRST TOP HEADLINE IN THE PARODY IS DEPORTATIONS TO BEGIN. WELL, THEY HAVE. LET'S LOOK AND SEE IF THEY GOT THE REST RIGHT. NEW LIBEL LAW TARGETS AND SALUTES COME IN THE PRESS WELL, THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT IS HAPPENING. U.S. SOLDIERS REFUSE ORDERS TO KILL ISIS FAMILIES. IN FACT WE JUST HAD A STORY LEFT WEEK WHERE THE GENERALS WERE SHOWING A DRONE STRIKE TO DONALD TRUMP AND THEY SHOWED HIM THE TARGET LEAVING HIS HOUSE WHERE HIS FAMILY WAS, AND THEN THEY KILLED HIM AND THEY SAID THAT WAS TO AVOID CIVILIAN CASUALTIES, AND DONALD TRUMP SAID, WHY DID YOU WAIT? IN OTHER WORDS, WHY DIDN'T YOU KILL THE FAMILY MEMBERS? SO THAT'S AT LEAST 3-FOR-3, LET ALONE THERE WAS ANOTHER PART OF THE HEADLINE THAT SAID MARKETS SINK AS TRADE WAR LOOMS. MAINLY REVOLVING AROUND MEXICO IN CHINA. THAT'S 4-FOR-4. MAN, DID THEY UNFORTUNATELY GET THIS RIGHT, AND TWO YEARS LATER IT IS NO LONGER A PARODY, IT'S THE SAD FARCE THAT WE ALL LIVE IN.
