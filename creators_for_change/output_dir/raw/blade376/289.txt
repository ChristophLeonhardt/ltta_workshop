00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
I feel safe in stupid right now because

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,269
I've come back into<font color="#E5E5E5"> our room I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,660
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and my left ear is completely</font>

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,199
screwed because the swimming pool water

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,020
so it's blocked and as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like I'd</font>

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,560
dump all my laundry underneath the left

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,439
the the desk by my bed as I did our

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,060
sauce like moving a saint in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the corner</font>

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">there but my vision is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not good enough</font>

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I swear it's twitching I don't know</font>

11
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,000
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is and I hate spiders yes so I</font>

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,800
might look at that I'll keep turning the

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,600
light on trying to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out is somebody</font>

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,219
use this to zoom in so this is the first

15
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,629
time I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a good zoom up a</font>

16
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:44,250
bit if this freaks me out i'm getting

17
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,640
over but i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> only wearing a towel which</font>

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,489
isn't good so here goes nothing and if

19
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,149
you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,580
what is it

21
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't tell what it is see I swear is</font>

22
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:16,790
moving

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,030
I hate when your mind plays tricks on me

24
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,950
because now I'm going to go under here

25
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,229
but it won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> book my mileage you can do</font>

26
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:39,240
this what is it

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,790
Khan tell what it is it's a bit of fluff

28
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,400
it's not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> a solid object</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm such an</font>

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,490
idiot

30
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:13,630
yet it was just a bit of fluff my

31
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,459
coordination is completely messed up all

32
00:02:15,459 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of my ear I feel stupid adios</font>
