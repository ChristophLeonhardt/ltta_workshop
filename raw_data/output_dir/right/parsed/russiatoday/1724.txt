Ronde stabilizes this entire region it
supports proxy militias and terrorist
groups in arms it is an arms dealer to
the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Iran
conducts cyber hacking campaigns and it
supports the murderous assad regime as
well unlike the prior administration we
will not neglect the vast scope of
Iran's terrorism it is indeed the
greatest sponsor of terrorism the world
and we are determined to make sure it
never possesses a nuclear weapon the
Iran deal in its current form does not a
problem provide that assurance we will
continue to work with our European
allies to fix that deal but if a deal
cannot reach the president has said that
he will leave that deal
