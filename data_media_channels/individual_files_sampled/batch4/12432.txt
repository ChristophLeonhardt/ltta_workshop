now we have to get back into the news and think about dead elephants just less pleasant it's not as nice but in any case President Trump is walking back his administration's decision to end a three-year-old Obama era regulation banning big-game hunting trophies from Africa after a bunch of people who don't know anything about big-game hunting or conservation complained on Twitter even Republicans even conservatives are getting in on this because people don't seem to understand the rationale behind big-game hunting and trophies here uncle Jimbo explains we only kill animals to quote send out their numbers if we don't hunt then these animals will grow too big a number and they won't have enough food say you see we have to kill animals or else they'll die there it is it's simple enough we have to kill the animals or else they will die that's very very simple and you know it's it's comedic right it's so counterintuitive that hunting the animals will actually increase their numbers and lead to more conservation but just because you don't understand something doesn't mean it isn't true shallows are clear right and so the Atlantic summed up stupid coverage of this this weekend they wrote quote if you were an elephant you might be puzzling over human behavior this week well I'm not an elephant also elephants don't puzzle you know because they're animals but but this is how they think right if if I were the animal if animals were like people they'd go further they say if elephants are recognized as a legal persons a term the US courts have granted to corporations well and and New Zealand has given to a river and it's been extended to yada yada yada it would be more difficult to hunt them at all let alone import their body parts right so it is true let me try to explain this to the Atlantic how an elephant might not be a person but corporations are people corporations are are groups of people they're not groups of animals they're not buildings they're not newspapers they're groups of people working in corporation with one another and you don't surrender your rights your constitutional rights just because you work with other people that's why famously Mitt Romney he was pilloried for this but it nevertheless is the case corporations are people what else are they they aren't gates they are and Correns they are in buildings there people there groups of people working together now here is a statistic thirty thousand elephants a year are killed by poachers when we're talking about big-game hunting and giving out licenses we're talking about a handful of these things per year we're not talking about the thirty thousand they're killed because their tusks are so valuable that starving people in Africa who want to make a profit decide to kill them and they sell an ounce of it and they make a year's salary according to a 2005 paper in the journal of international wildlife law legalization of white rhinoceros hunting in South Africa motivated private landowners to reintroduce the species onto their lands so we're not just talking about in the preserves that are held by the public or held by the government or whatever we're talking about incentives so when this became legal the landowners realized oh interesting if we bring some of those things on here that are worth a ton of money and we allow people to hunt for them then we will make money too as a result there was an increase in white rhinos from fewer than one hundred individual rhinos to more than eleven thousand even while only a limited number were killed as trophies well how does this work it's because conservation is expensive so you remember this a couple years ago in May 2015 a Texan legally shot a critically endangered black rhino in Namibia so there's the species of black rhino they're critically endangered this guy goes over there and shoots one he bought a license for $350,000 that was money generated from the hunt was a totally managed hunt that money was reinvested in conservation maintaining habitats maintaining environments keeping people around to stop the poachers and the key here isn't even a money per se obviously in Namibia three hundred fifty thousand dollars goes a long way goes farther than it does in Los Angeles or New York but that isn't it it's about the system of incentives just like you know capitalism as as we describe it and I don't even like to use that term it's a term that was invented by socialists to pillory free markets but freedom economic freedom free markets protected by the rule of law and people making sure there's a level it's not just about all of the wealth of producers though it does the reason it produces that wealth is because all of the incentives are aligned so if we're just talking about conservation and only basing it on altruism there's a limit to human altruism but there isn't a limit to human humans looking after their own interests and hopefully producing good along the way meaning property meaning prosperity meaning jobs for people meaning wealth to invest in the environment we'll talk about this a little bit more on Thursday when we get to Thanksgiving but the pilgrims learn this lesson very hard after a couple years incentives are important here so for instance when this big-game hunting is illegal when trophies can be taken home then there's more of an incentive to have wild land and less farmland so it keeps the wild wild why is this well if landowners can make more money either the government or private landowners can make more money from selling licenses and letting people hunt these beautiful animals than they can from farming then they're going to do that right but but if they start farming then they're gonna cut down all of the grazing habitats anyway so controlled legalized hunting has also been beneficial for Zimbabwe elephants now that this is the big issue people love elephants I love elephants it's the symbol of my dear political party where elephant designs and things like that for just that reason there are those weird videos of elephants painting that are very terrifying you know they're clearly they exhibit some intelligence so they say well if we allow this these trophies then you know then the elephants are going to be endangered and all of their tusks are going to be taken and sold for the ivory but trophy hunting has doubled the area of that country under wildlife management relative to the 13 percent in state protected areas why is that because there's incentive incentive for wild areas to remain wild as a result the area of suitable land available to elephants and other wildlife has increased and by the way we're not talking about post hunt sales so we're not saying well there will be more and there will be a freer market and trading in these things so poachers are just gonna go ahead and get them and sell them there first of all they're already doing that poaching is the problem these big-game hunters are statistically insignificant when we're talking about big-game elephant rhinoceros is being killed but we're not even talking about post on sales we're talking about trophies so you have to hunt it you have to get it you have to bring it home you can't buy it from a poacher it doesn't change that market whatsoever now talking just about rhinos two rhinos per day were killed in Africa in 2012 well over 700 Africa's there is 700 rhinos South Africa alone 461 rhinos were killed in just the first half of 2013 South Africa is a major area for this so we know that that's the problem the problem is an Eric Trump going and hunting or some dentist from America or a guy who purchases a very expensive permit to go to conservation efforts it's difficult for lefties to consider these things beyond the the graphic even some conservatives have fallen into this I saw a lot of famous right-wing celebrities I won't name them because they're allies and they're usually right but they were wrong about this saying this is awful Donald Trump you have to get rid of this is so terrible but you know shallows are clear folks very often you know you see the picture you see the poor little rhinoceros or the animals or the cheetahs and you say we shouldn't do that but your gut emotional visceral reaction is not necessarily the way to protect these animals it isn't enough to say not that one oh look we saved sessile isn't that okay don't worry everything's fine now sessile isn't the issue the issue is 30000 - this is being killed every year the issue is or poachers because these these trophies have value to them and the challenge is to stop being emotional - stop saying well as long as we don't see anymore pictures that's all well and good you have to think beyond the pictures and think about creating incentives and systems that will actually protect those animals so as a result I hope that President Trump thinks about this thoughtfully and doesn't simply listen to all of the people on Twitter because people on Twitter very often don't know a thing
