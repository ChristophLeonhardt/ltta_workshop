IS A PART OF POSITIVE CAPITALIST
AND THE SHOW.
316.
HE SAID HE WOULD DRAIN THE SWAMP
IN WASHINGTON DC.
WHEN WE TAKE ON AN INDUSTRY OR
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL OR A MEMBER
ENTERTAINING WAY AND WE ALWAYS
DO IT IN A FAIR WAY BUT ABOVE
ALL WE DO IT BECAUSE WE REALLY
WANT TO SEE THE SYSTEM CHANGE.
WHEN WE DO SEE CHANGE AS A
RESULT OF OUR CAMPAIGNING WE
HELP OF THE GOVERNMENT
BUSINESS EXPERIENCE INTO
GOVERNMENT BUT THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE ALSO WANT TO KNOW THAT
WHEN BUSINESS LEADERS SERVING
GOVERNMENT REPRESENT THE
INTEREST OF ALL AMERICAN
BUSINESS, NOT JUST THEIR OWN.
AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION'S TRADE EFFORTS
IS COMMERCE SECRETARY WILBUR
ROSS WHO, IS IT TURNS OUT, IS NO
STRANGER TO THE STEEL INDUSTRY.
HE'S NEGOTIATING OVER SOUTH
KOREAN STEEL IMPORTS WHILE
MAKING MONEY FROM IMPORTING
SOUTH KOREAN STEEL.
CONFLICT OF INTEREST HERE THAT
SHIPS STEEL TO THE REST OF THE
OTHER HAND NEGOTIATING
TERRORISTS ON THE KOREAN STEEL.
THEY ALSO ARGUE THE POTENTIAL
SANCTIONS UNDER THIS BLOOD DON'T
AFFECT THE COMPANY THAT SHIPS
THE STUPID THINGS HAVE GOTTEN
WORSE FOR THE SECRETARY BUT IT'S
NOT BEEN REVEALED THAT WILL BE
LOST BUILT TO THE BEST A NUMBER
OF ASSETS THAT HE PROMISED HE
WILL SELL HIS ETHICS AGREEMENT
WITH THE PERMIT OF COMMERCE
PLEASE, MR. SECRETARY, DO THE
RIGHT THING.
HE NOW DONE THE RIGHT THING AT
LAST AND BEFORE OUR INITIAL
REPORT WE REACH OUT TO SECRETARY
ROSS INVITING HIM TO COME AND
STATEMENT AFTER THE SHOW AIRED
INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.
RUBBER CLOTH DEFENSE WAS TO
CLAIM HE WAS NOT VIOLATING ANY
ETHICS PUBLISHED WAS BECAUSE
TRADE NEGOTIATIONS DON'T AFFECT
THE COMPANIES HE PARTIALLY OWNS
BUT HOW COULD NEGOTIATIONS ON
TERRORISTS FOR SOUTH KOREA
FAILED TO AFFECT THE SHIPPING
COMPANIES THAT STEAL FROM AND
HOW COULD NEGOTIATIONS WITH
TENANT NOT AFFECT ANOTHER
SHIPPING COMPANY THAT CONDUCTED
BUSINESS WITH THE CHINESE STATE
OWNED COMPANY, PETRO CHINA.
WORSE THAN THAT CLAIM IN HIS
ACCORDANCE AGREEMENT SIMPLY WAS
NOT TRUE A FEW WEEKS LATER
OF ASSETS HEAPED WITH YOU SELL
INCLUDING STOCKS IN THE COMPANY
CALLED INVESTIGATIVE.
LAST WEEK THE VALUES OF THOSE
ASSETS GROUP EARNING HIS NET
TWO-$62 MILLION BUT THE DAY HE
PROMISED TO SELL THEM IN THE DAY
HE ACTUALLY SAID THEM SECRETARY
ROSS ADMITTED MISTAKE THE
CLAIMED HE WILL NOT SELL STOCKS
TO US HIDING BEHIND THE OFFICE
OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS CAME BACK
TO BITE HIM BECAUSE WHEN THEY
GOT WIND OF THE MILLIONS OF
IT --
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT ACTION.
YES, THAT WOULD BE US.
IN RESPONSE TO THE ETHICS OF
REACHED OUT TO THE OFFICE TO
VERIFY THAT THE SALES WILL
INCLUDE HIS INTEREST IN NAUTICAL
BUILDINGS, SHIPPING AND THE
TRANSPORTATION RECOVERY FUND,
ALL BUT REPORTED AS CONFLICT OF
INTEREST IN OUR ORIGINAL
STOPWATCH THEY CONFIRMED THAT
HIS SALES WILL INCLUDE THOSE
INTERESTS.
THAT IS GREAT NEWS.
AS I SAID, WILBUR ROSS HAS DONE
THE RIGHT THING.
YOU SHOULD NOW GET CREDIT FOR
THAT.
THE STORY WAS NEVER JUST ABOUT
WILBUR ROSS IT WAS ABOUT THIS
THING PRESIDENT TRUMPS DURING
THE SWAMP AGENDA.
IT'S THE BIGGEST MOST PROMISES
HE MADE THE 16.
