Donald Trump is officially right now as you surely know three hours away from making a decision that could outlast his presidency that could rewrite civil rights protections and abortion laws for a generation we want to begin by showing you the live view here this is right outside the Supreme Court we're told protesters plan a massive demonstration there tonight as a countermeasure to this much-anticipated 9 p.m. announcement Eastern time for Donald Trump's pick for the high court now top democratic senators already vowing to block any nominee he may pick that would overturn roe v wade at this moment we can also report their sources close to the White House saying Trump has already made this decision no clear leaks though on who it would be but there are rumors about four finalists and two frontrunners tonight judges Brent Cavanaugh and Thomas hardiman's seen his frontrunner Cavanaugh has worked for the Supreme Court as a clerk as well as for GOP favorite Ken Starr he also wrote a controversial decision against an immigrants right to seek an abortion in the United States and this is brand-new you can see a New York Times reporter posting this information on Twitter that Cavanaugh was just spotted leaving a federal courthouse in Washington and a black sedan accompanied by count'em for SUVs with security agents that is a big clue that it is a formal security retinue more on that in a moment the other frontrunner Hardiman serves on the same appellate court as Trump's sister his blue-collar background has said to be appealing to Donald Trump he overturned the conviction of an anti-abortion protester and has been seen as a very reliable supporter of individual gun rights meanwhile the president has been hyping the run-up to tonight's event I believe this person will do a great job but I'm I'm very close to making a decision have not made it official yet obviously have not made it final but we're very close to making a decision there were reports that Donald Trump is also concerned about the fight that could occur in this narrowly divided Senate as you probably know as well a single Republican defection could tip the balance of the court you see there and allow Democrats to block the pic that's assuming Democrats are united but get this the last time there was one of these situations in the Trump era three Democratic senators back Donald Trump tonight those three you see on your screen while they're declining invitations to attend Trump's announcement meanwhile other Democrats say they will do everything in their power to stop a bad pick if they vote for somebody who's going to change precedent it could be a career-ending move presidents outsource its decision to the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation I've never seen a president United States in effect make himself a puppet and if you don't like the ways that this new justice is going to impact everything speak up get active and vote monkey up the works I mean Democrats need to be I think a little bit more aggressive here this is a mobilizing moment there's a strategic question here with some Democrats banking on what could be their best hope to win this fight trying to get moderate Dems to hold the line push voters to the polls and get at least one moderate Republican to join them in blocking any pick that Donald Trump makes tonight I'm joined by my special panel Brian Fallon worked for secretary Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign as well as at the Justice Department under Eric Holder exactly director of demand justice a group that is spending five million dollars opposing Trump's pick is his current role Wendy Davis who many remember as a Texas State Senator who filibustered 13 hours trying to block a law that Kennedy ultimately struck down I'm also joined by former Democratic senator Wisconsin Russ Feingold who knows a lot about these fights as well as the money that can affect them in Kristen Clark a president executive director of the lawyers Committee for civil rights under law a dealer's choice I could start anywhere given a lot of the expertise here but senator having been through some of these fights I start with you what are the stakes tonight well they couldn't be higher and and I think it's clear apologies to senators my fault senator Feingold first then senator Davis hello senator do listen the stakes couldn't possibly be higher and what we have here is the United States Supreme Court is really changing its character first of all it was stolen this this whole seat was stolen but over the Scalia ski seat and then after that what you have is a president who wasn't even elected by the majority of Americans being able to pick that replacement set of Barack Obama and now you have the president picking more people when he's under investigation for probably illegal activity both before and after he became president so what we really have here is the United States Supreme Court is becoming a kangaroo court and the definition of a kangaroo court is a court where the outcome is predetermined and Senator Davis as we look at the Supreme Court where many activists are gathering tonight I want to play for you a person who has become sort of the shadow president in the Trump era when it comes to these appointments as you know not a household name but so important Leonard Leo who runs the Federalist Society and what I'm saying may sound like a criticism it may make Donald Trump sound like he's taking a kind of a backseat but it's what he and his advisor stressed as far back as the campaign that he wasn't going to really make these decisions himself take a listen to mr. Leo playing down the threat to roe v wade is it fair to say that anyone who made it on your list is likely to be an opponent of roe v wade no first of all nobody really knows so I think it's a bit of a scare tactic and rank speculation more than anything else senator Davis is that correct I cannot imagine for a minute that that is correct the Federalist Society has as one of its primary goals overturning roe v wade and I highly doubt that they would create a list of judicial potential judicial nominees if they weren't fairly certain that the people that were on that list were those who were going to be a vote to overturn Roe on the Supreme Court and Kristin your view of that I think that's right all of the nominees on president Trump's shortlist were hand-picked cherry picked by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation and we know because President Trump has made clear over and over again that his goal is to appoint two or three justices to this court who will overturn Roe versus Wade so there is every expectation to believe that the person he identifies as the nominee tonight is somebody who will carry out his agenda and so it's time for the Senate to do its job this fight it's not over it is just beginning it's time for the Senate to properly and fully vet the nominee identified by the president tonight we can't return to a world in which the reproductive rights and freedom of women is cast aside and Senator Feingold on the latest news here as everyone is bracing for what could be this gigantic fight I wonder your your view the significance is something we can put on the screen a New York Times reporter noting just moments ago that there's this buzz at the US courthouse because Brett Kavanaugh was spotted leaving in a black sedan with four black SUVs with security agents in The Times careful phrasing he said presumed to be Secret Service as you know senator Feingold there's a expression about people who roll deep or roll with many cars but that many SUVs is is a pretty clear signal that does that change your analysis go ahead no I mean look it doesn't matter which of the four it is it doesn't matter which of the 25 it is this is a predetermined situation Senator Bob Casey had it right today when he put out a tweet and said I'm voting against this nominee because all of this is part of a corrupt deal made by big corporations and by the Republicans and by Trump it has nothing to do with the merits of the individual candidate it has everything to do with delegitimizing the Supreme Court and destroying one of the most important institutions of our country Brian well yeah I mean certainly we don't know yet who the pick is gonna be but if it's Brett Kavanaugh this is somebody that fits the Trump litmus test to a tee and I think that the case that those of us on the progressive side of things will make against somebody let bright Cavanaugh is just go through the issues number one row in addition to the president's litmus test Brett Kavanaugh himself has given speeches praising the dissent the dissent in the roe v wade case on ACA Brett Kavanaugh did not join the opinion upholding the ACA when it came before the DC Circuit and in fact he gave a speech criticizing the rationale Justice Roberts used to uphold the ACA and then the coup de Gras the number three issue and the one that's probably most resonant with Donald Trump is Brett Cavanaugh has been outspoken for the last twenty years about his view that a sitting president cannot be indicted and that a president should be able to get to cherry-pick who gets to investigate him and fire them for any reason that is probably music to Donald Trump's ears so I think those are the three issues you're gonna hear to frame the case against Cavanaugh if indeed this motorcade coming out of the DC Circuit courthouse is any indication right and and we don't know why he was in that situation but we knew though that we do know that's a rare situation you don't see that kind of security for most federal judges a walking around or leaving court Wendy take a listen to Donald Trump in October 2016 in a statement that I know for your group and people affiliated with your organization would find chilling which was he said basically if he gets two to three picks Rowe goes automatically and we're speaking here tonight hours away from his second pick take a listen do you want to see the court overturned well if we put another two or perhaps three justices on that's really what's going to be had that's will happen and that'll happen automatically in my opinion because I am putting pro-life justices on the court contrast that to a large pro-life organization the Federalist Society that's created this list that we just showed denying it I mean your group is you've spoken out in been pro-choice these other groups seem to be pro-life up until the moment we have a confirmation fight and then they back away from it when their own candidate here now president has said this is what he's here to do this is pick number two in a stated public vow to overturn Roe right I mean we're in a very precarious situation because as you mentioned earlier re we have three Democrats who actually went along with the former Trump kick so what's going to happen with them can we depend or rely on pressure with Susan Collins actually to reject any of these picks the answer is likely no and the question then becomes what will the public response be will we finally understand that when we are abrogating our responsibility to vote for Senate leaders and a president who is going to place a Supreme Court that has respect in the constitutional values that have existed for decades when we abrogate our responsibility to do that we lose our rights in very significant and important ways and it's my hope that this will be a rally cry for Democrats all over the country particularly moderate independent women who for a long time felt that this was something that was never going to happen this was a right we could take for granted and I think tonight we're going to find the answer to that that right is no longer going to exist well and Kristin speak to that to Wendy's point broadening it out to other civil rights and other forms of progress that people consider because Justice Kennedy's legacy of course among other things is being a relatively conservative Republican who advanced marriage equality United States obviously we're looking at certain jurists who if they replaced that one vote and that issue comes back up it would go the other way we know we're the majority the Chief Justice excuse me Roberts is we know where the potential majority on the court is so how do those issues figure in as well and how does that play into the midterms if if people think that you have Democrats who don't seem to be able to stop the worst things in Washington in their view there is no shortage of incredibly important civil rights cases that are making their way up the Supreme Court pipeline and cases that will be before the court next term cases dealing with gerrymandering will return to the court voting rights cases criminal justice and you're right Justice Kennedy has been a critical swing vote on marriage equality on fair housing cases on race-conscious admissions policies in the higher ed context and so much more and so the balance of the court is at stake with this nomination I will say this that this fight is not over it's now time for the Senate to do its job they should not rubber stamp president Trump's nominee this evening we need thorough hearin stand the records underlying all of the folks on president Trump shortlist he has said over and over again that his commitment is to overturning Roe and to gutting health care which would impact the lives of vulnerable Americans all over the country and and it's time for us to vote and recognize that elections have consequences in our country it's not just the Supreme Court but we've seen President Trump make damaging selections to district and circuit courts all of place our country and so exercising the right to vote really is key so Brian on the strategy here what do you see as the best road to actually stopping the pic well I think that the analog situation here is that is the health care debate last year there are two people started off thinking that Democrats didn't have much of a shot of stopping the repeal effort but we did two things we successfully United Democrats and then we successfully peeled off these same moderate Republicans that we'll be targeting in this Supreme Court fight and the ACA is actually I think alongside Roe going to be a defining issue in the consideration of Trump's pick I say that because re as you know just last month the administration took the exceedingly rare step of declaring it would not be defending the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act in a lawsuit that has been brought by a bunch of Republican state attorneys general down in Texas the judge the district court judge presiding over that case in Texas is a former John Cornyn chief council formers political staffer for John Cornyn I can't imagine he's going to be very hospitable to an argument defending the ACA then in that case you could have it heard that case be heard by the Fifth Circuit was the most conservative circuit in United States so this challenge to the ACA brought by the Trump administration and Republican state attorneys general could very well end up in the lap of the Supreme Court we could have a third case in front of the Supreme Court I think as a result you're gonna see a lot of questions asked of this nominee on ACA Trump himself said he would only nominate somebody that would rule the opposite way of John Roberts and declare the ACA unconstitutional and the salience of this re as we know the ACA is an issue that unites our caucus and also can help peel off Collins and Murkowski and just tonight Joe Manchin in cating that he was declining the White House's invitation to go be there for the announcement of the nominee said that the number one issue he's going to use for assessing Trump's pick is whether that person will upholds the constitutionality of pre-existing conditions so look for this issue to be one that could perhaps unite those moderate red state Democrats in Trump won states well that's very interesting coming from you being involved in the fight and the notion that this is a different kind of battle between ACA between the real vote counting going on with Roe and then the wild card of the Moller probe and how this person might rule on things that effect existential questions in the trump presidency so almost impossible to predict hey I'm
