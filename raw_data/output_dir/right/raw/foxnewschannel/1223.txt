SERVED AS CHIEF FOR THE STATION

ALSO A CONTRIBUTOR.

13

THANK YOU GOOD TO SEE YOU.

14
00:00:18,116 --> 00:00:18,817
A BIG SURPRISE THIS WEEK WHEN

15
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:20,952
THE RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER, THE

16
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:23,655
RIGHT-HAND MAN OF PUTIN OF

17
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:24,956

18
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:25,757
VISIT TO PYONGYANG.

00:00:25,757 --> 00:00:30,028
REALLY THEY WERE MONUMENTAL

20
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:30,795
SITES AND MEETINGS.

21
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:34,933
WHAT TO MAKE OF HYMN SUDDENLY

22
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:38,069
GOING OFF TO KIM JONG-UN OWN?

23
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:38,837
>> WE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO

24
00:00:38,837 --> 00:00:39,738
TALKING ABOUT RUSSIA MEDDLING

25
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:42,140
IN OUR ELECTIONS.

26
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,008
NOW WE ARE SEEING THE RUSSIAN

27
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,175
MEDDLING IN OUR EFFORTS TO

28
00:00:44,175 --> 00:00:44,809
BRING PEACE TO THE KOREAN

29
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:50,582
PENINSULA.HE HAD NOT BEEN

30
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:51,449
THERE SINCE AT LEAST A DECADE.

31
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:52,684
HE APPARENTLY DID NOT HAVE ANY

32
00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:54,185
PRIVATE MEETINGS.

33
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:56,821
THIS IS FOR THE PUBLIC TO

34
00:00:56,821 --> 00:00:57,722
CONSUME AND IT WAS DEFINITELY A

35
00:00:57,722 --> 00:01:01,726
MESSAGE TO NORTH KOREA

36
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:02,127
LEADERSHIP.

37
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:03,161
HE HAD PUBLIC MEETINGS WITH KIM

38
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:04,062
JONG-UN AS WELL AS A MESSAGE TO

39
00:01:04,062 --> 00:01:06,231
THE UNITED STATES.

40
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:07,599
THE FOCUS WAS ON SANCTIONS AND

41
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,035
HE TALKED ABOUT RATIONING DOWN

42
00:01:10,035 --> 00:01:10,902
SANCTIONS BEFORE NORTH KOREA

43
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:16,141
TAKES THE ACTION THAT WE DEEM

44
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:16,808
NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE THE

45
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:17,409
NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARSENAL.

46
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:22,781
>> WHAT IS IN RUSSIA'S

47
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:23,148
INTEREST.

48
00:01:23,148 --> 00:01:24,115
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAID?

49
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:26,484
>> VERSUS RICK REMEMBER THAT

50
00:01:26,484 --> 00:01:27,385
NORTH KOREA IS AN OLD SOVIET

51
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:27,986
SATELLITE STATE.

52
00:01:27,986 --> 00:01:31,990
IN FACT THE FIRSTLY OF NORTH

53
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,791
KOREA, WAS A MAJOR IN THE

54
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:33,658
SOVIET ARMY AND FOUGHT AGAINST

55
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:36,361
THE JAPANESE DURING WORLD WAR

56
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:36,628
II.

57
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:37,329
THE SOVIETS INSTALLED HIM AS

58
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:38,630
THE LEADER OF THE FIRST LEADER

59
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,097
OF NORTH KOREA.

60
00:01:39,097 --> 00:01:39,798
IT IS NOT TAUGHT IN NORTH

61
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:42,767
KOREAN HISTORY BOOKS FOR THEIR

62
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:43,134
STUDENTS.

63
00:01:43,134 --> 00:01:45,070
BUT IT IS A TRUE FACT.

64
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,970
THE RUSSIANS ABSOLUTELY WANT TO

65
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:51,576
PLAY A ROLE IN THE DIPLOMACY IN

66
00:01:51,576 --> 00:01:51,976
THE REGION.

67
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:52,677
FIRST AND FOREMOST, THEY WANT

68
00:01:52,677 --> 00:01:57,315
TO COUNTER UNITED STATES

69
00:01:57,315 --> 00:01:57,916
STRATEGICALLY.

70
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:58,750
THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

71
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,651
THE UNITED STATES INFLUENCE IN

72
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:00,919
THE REGION BOTH MILITARILY AND

73
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:01,319
POLITICALLY.

74
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,988
THEY LIKE TO REDUCE OUR

75
00:02:03,988 --> 00:02:04,489
MILITARY PRESENCE.

76
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:04,989
AND OUR INFLUENCE.

77
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:06,291
SO I THINK THAT IS PART OF THE

78
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,192
REASON WHY THEY SUPPORT KIM

79
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:11,796
JONG-UN OWN BUT IS JUST A

80
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:12,997
LEGACY FROM THE SOVIET DAYS.

81
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:13,898
THEY ALSO SUPPORT KIM JONG-UN

82
00:02:13,898 --> 00:02:14,566
BECAUSE THEY FRANKLY, THEY

83
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:15,600
DON'T LIKE SANCTIONS TO WHICH

84
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,674
THEY HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED.

85
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:24,008
AND THEY WERE INTERFERING IN

86
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:24,876
ELECTIONS AND IN EUROPE AND THE

87
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:25,744
UNITED STATES POSSESSES THE

88
00:02:25,744 --> 00:02:26,478
POLITICAL AND POTENTIAL

89
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:29,814
ECONOMIC BENEFIT FROM RESISTING

90
00:02:29,814 --> 00:02:30,248
THE SANCTIONS.

91
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:31,316
THEY BELIEVE IF OUR

92
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:32,217
RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM JONG-UN

93
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:33,118
OWN AND NORTH KOREA DOESN'T PAN

94
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:34,419
OUT, THEY WANT TO BE THERE AND

95
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:36,421
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF INCREASED

96
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:36,721
TRADE.

97
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:38,656
THEY'RE ALREADY VIOLATING

98
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:39,557
SANCTIONS WITH THE EXPORT OF

99
00:02:39,557 --> 00:02:40,358
OIL IN LOAN NORTH KOREAN

100
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:44,195
WORKERS TO RESIDE AND WORK IN

101
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:44,529
RUSSIA.

102
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:47,165
BUT THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO A LOT

103
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:48,032
MORE ECONOMICALLY WITH NORTH

104
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:48,466
KOREA.

105
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:50,368
>> THEY WANT A PIECE OF THE

106
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:50,902
PIE.

107
00:02:50,902 --> 00:02:51,636
AND THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING THE

108
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:53,571
RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN CROSSING

109
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:54,839
SANCTIONS WITH OIL TANKERS,

110
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:57,375
TRANSPORTING OIL WHICH IS

111
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,310
AGAINST PYONGYANG.

112
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:05,617
AND EVADING SANCTIONS THAT THEY

113
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:06,418
BASICALLY VOTED FOR IN THE

114
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:07,118
SECURITY COUNCIL.

115
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:10,155
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

116
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:11,122
I THINK IT IS A BALANCING ACT

117
00:03:11,122 --> 00:03:11,489
FOR THEM.

118
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:12,223
AND OF THE NEED TO DO A LITTLE

119
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:13,358
BIT AND I THINK FRANKLY,

120
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:14,959
PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOWS STRENGTH.

121
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:15,760
THEY WERE NERVOUS ABOUT THE

122
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,229
POTENTIAL FOR HOSTILITY BETWEEN

123
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:19,397
THE UNITED STATES AND OUR

124
00:03:19,397 --> 00:03:19,998
ALLIES AND NORTH KOREA.

125
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:24,235
SO THEY DID TAKE SOME ACTION

126
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:25,570
WITH SANCTIONS BUT THEY HAVE

127
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,871
BEEN BUSTING THEM A LITTLE BIT.

128
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:30,408
OF COURSE THEY HAVE THE SITE OF

129
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:31,242
SOME EXPORTS OF RUSSIAN GOODS

130
00:03:31,242 --> 00:03:33,945
TO NORTH KOREA.

131
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:36,848
AND THIS IS 60 MILES FROM THE

132
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:37,749
NORTH KOREAN BORDER THAT IS THE

133
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:43,455
STRATEGIC PORT OF RUSSIA.

134
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:44,322
>> AND LAVROV POPPED UP.THIS

135
00:03:44,322 --> 00:03:45,256
IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD TO

136
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:45,723
SAY.

137
00:03:45,723 --> 00:03:48,359
>> I DID NOT LIKE THE RUSSIAN

138
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:48,860
MEETING YESTERDAY.

139
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,961
I SAY WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF

140
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:52,464
THAT?

141
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:53,364
BUT IT COULD BE A POSITIVE

142
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:53,698
MEETING.

143
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:54,632
IF IT IS A POSITIVE MEETING I

144
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:54,999
LOVE IT.

145
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:56,734
IF IT'S A NEGATIVE MEETING I'M

146
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:57,101
NOT HAPPY.

147
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:59,070
AND IT COULD VERY WELL BE

148
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,437
POSITIVE.

149
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:03,608
>> THEY ARE DISCUSSING A

150
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:08,980
POSSIBLE SUMMIT BETWEEN DONALD

151
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,814
TRUMP AND PUTIN PAY WHAT YOU

152
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:10,515
THINK THEY SHOULD DO?

153
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:11,382
>> I THINK THE PRESENT WOULD

154
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:12,617
KEEP IN MIND, THE FAILURES OF

155
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:13,952
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.

156
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,853
THE OBAMA MINISTRATION BELIEVED

157
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:18,857
RUSSIA WAS ON OUR SIDE.

158
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:19,224
IN SYRIA.

159
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:21,125
AND WHEN THE RUSSIANS SAID, WAS

160
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,861
SECRETARY LAVROV TOLD SECRETARY

161
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:24,429
KERRY THERE WAS NO MILITARY

162
00:04:24,429 --> 00:04:27,565
SOLUTION IN SYRIA, LAVROV WAS

163
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:33,204
LYING ABOUT THAT.

164
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:34,138
WE KNOW THAT RUSSIA DOES NOT

165
00:04:34,138 --> 00:04:37,041
HAVE OUR BEST INTEREST AT

166
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:37,342
HEART.

167
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:37,942
ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA.

168
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:38,743
I THINK THE PRESIDENT KNOWS

169
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:39,544
THAT AND I THINK SECRETARY

170
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:40,578
POMPEO WILL BE GREAT AS WELL

171
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:43,414
THE NEW DIRECTOR OF CIA, GINA

172
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:48,419
HASPEL WHICH IS A SUBJECT

173
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:49,187
MATTER EXPERT ON RUSSIA.

174
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:50,522
THE KEY RAN OVER THE

175
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:51,256
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY

176
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:52,123
FURNISHING THE PRESIDENT WITH

177
00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:52,957
THE INTELLIGENCE HE NEEDS TO HE

178
00:04:52,957 --> 00:04:55,126
WILL BE IN THE KNOW ABOUT WHAT

179
00:04:55,126 --> 00:05:00,164
RUSSIA AND VLADIMIR PUTIN 'S

180
00:05:00,164 --> 00:05:02,967
REAL INTENTIONS ARE.

181
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:03,801
THE BEST LEVERAGE WE HAVE

182
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:08,773
AGAINST NORTH KOREA IS BY

183
00:05:08,773 --> 00:05:09,607
PUSHING THIS BILATERAL

184
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:10,441
RELATIONSHIP THAT WE ENJOY

185
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:11,209
RIGHT NOW WITH THE NORTH

186
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:11,709
KOREANS.

187
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:12,577
I THINK THE PRESIDENTS MEETING

188
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:13,311
YESTERDAY WITH KIM YONG-CHOL,

189
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:13,912
THAT WAS EXTRA NEARLY

190
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:14,879
IMPORTANT.

191
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,415
THOSE ARE THE RELATIONSHIPS I

192
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:19,817
THINK THAT NEGOTIATIONS REALLY

193
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:20,218
DEPEND UPON.

194
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:21,386
WE SAW SECRETARY POMPEO WHO

195
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:26,324
VISITED NORTH KOREA TWICE.

196
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:27,158
MET WITH KIM YONG-CHOL TWO

197
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:27,825
TIMES THERE.

198
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:28,660
ESSENTIALLY DELIVER A WARM

199
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,294
TURNOVER TO THE PRESIDENT.

200
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:31,095
I THINK THAT IS HOW WE HANDLE

201
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:33,998
RUSSIA, BY FOCUSING ON THE

202
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:34,899
BILATERAL ENGAGEMENT WITH NORTH

203
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:35,199
KOREA.

204
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,467
TRY THE SIX PARTY TALKS AND TWO

205
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:40,271
OF THOSE PARTIES, RUSSIA AND

206
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:41,139
CHINA ARE NOT REALLY UP TO HELP

207
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:41,706
US TOO MUCH.

208
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:42,540
>> FINALLY I GUESS YOU WOULD

209
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,841
SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT UPSTAGED

210
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:45,109
PUTIN.

211
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:45,810
MAYBE THAT IS WHY LAVROV MADE

212
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,612
THE TRIP?

213
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:50,081
THAT PUTIN SEES HIMSELF ON THE

214
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:50,882
OUTS WERE NOT PART OF THIS

215
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:53,217
ONGOING PROCESS WITH THE

216
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:54,085
PRESIDENT ON THE JUNE 12 SUMMIT

217
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:56,821
WITH KIM JONG-UN.>> I THINK

218
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:57,589
THAT IS INSIGHTFUL.

219
00:05:57,589 --> 00:05:59,457
I WOULD AGREE 100 PERCENT.

220
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:00,258
I THINK THE RUSSIANS ARE A

221
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:03,995
LITTLE NERVOUS AT THE UNITED

222
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:04,796
STATES SEIZED THE INITIATIVE.

223
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:08,866
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT

224
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,134
PRESIDENT TRUMP SEIZED THE

225
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:10,868
INITIATIVE ON THE KOREAN

226
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:11,235
PENINSULA.

227
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:12,403
IT DOES CAUSE VLADIMIR PUTIN

228
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:12,837
SOME CONCERN.

229
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:13,905
THE ON THE OUTSIDE PRODUCE A

230
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:18,743
VERY PUBLIC STATEMENT.

231
00:06:18,743 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB
