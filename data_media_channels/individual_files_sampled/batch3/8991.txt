AVENATTI IS A BEAST. HE KEEPS POPPING TRUMP AND HIS FOLKS IN THE MOUTH. HE MAY BE THE SAVIOR OF THE REPUBLIC. HE IS A MASTER OF THE MEDIA CYCLE. I OWE AVENATTI AN APOLOGY. FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS I'M SAYING ENOUGH ALREADY, MICHAEL. I SEE YOU EVERY. WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE TO SAY? I WAS WRONG. YOU HAVE A LOT TO SAY. THE DEMOCRATS COULD LEARN SOMETHING FROM YOU. Tucker: SAVIOR OF THE ME RUB SAVIOR OF THE RELUB REPUBLIC. WHO GIVES THESE PEOPLE SHOWS. HUNDREDS OF MEDIA APPEARANCES PROPELLED HIM TO BE LEADING CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY. BUT THE CREEPY PORN LAWYER REMINDED THE PUBLIC WHILE EVIDENCE AND THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE MATTER. IT MAY HAVE SAVED BRETT KAVANAUGH IN THE PROCESS. SO NOW THE FORMER BENEFACTORS ARE MAD AND THEY ARE TURNING ON HIM. SOME OF YOUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES SAYING THE FELLOW DEMOCRATS' CASE AGAINST JUSTICE KAVANAUGH WAS WEAKENED BY MICHAEL AVENATTI. AVENATTI IS THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO KAVANAUGH. ALL THE DEMOCRATS FLIRTING WITH HIM HAVE TO BE EMBARRASSED. A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING AND ARE YOU HEARING THIS? THAT HE TOOK A SYMPATHETIC CASE WITH FORD AND TURNED IT INTO A CIRCUS LOSING THEM THE HIGH GROUND. YES. THE MICHAEL AVENATTI CIRCUS COMES TO TOWN. AVENATTI CAME IN WITH THE SWETNICK ALLEGATION OF THE DRUGGIE GANG RAPE STUFF THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN MUCH LESS TAKEN AS CREDIBLE. AVENATTI DUD A HUGE FAVOR TO THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE. Tucker: DAVID IS AN ATTORNEY AND FORMER ADVISER TO SENATOR PATTY MURRAY. HE JOINS US. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. Tucker: DID IT TURN OUT THAT STORMY DANIELS' FORMER LAWYER NOT IN THE END THE SAVIOR OF THE REPUBLIC AS MSNBC DUBBED HIM? IT GIVES HIM TOO MUCH CREDIT TO SAY HE WAS THE DECIDING FACTOR IN THIS. WE KNOW JUSTICE KAVANAUGH WAS CONFIRMED BECAUSE OF A PROCESS THAT THE REPUBLICANS RAN AND THEY WERE SINGLE-MIND AND DETERMINED TO ENSURE THE NOMINATION NO MATTER THE SERIOUS AND CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS THAT WERE RAISED AGAINST HIM. Tucker: I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT. I'M NOT SURE HE WAS DECISIVE IN THIS. THEY WEREN'T THE ONLY SINGLE-MINDED DETERMINED PARTY. THE DEMOCRATS WERE THOSE THINGS TOO. WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE ALLEGATION OF HIS CLIENT THAT SHE ATTENDED TEN CONSECUTIVE GANG RAPES, DIDN'T REPORT IT TO THE POLICE OR TELL FRIENDS OR RELATIVES AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH WAS PRESENT AT SOME OF THESE DRUGGING THE PUNCH. BUT WAIT, SHE SAYS LATER HE WASN'T. IS THAT A CREDIBLE ALLEGATION, DO YOU THINK? WHAT STRIKES ME ABOUT THE ALLEGATION AND I BELIEVE SHE SWORE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY IN HER DECLARATION. AS A LAWYER THAT SAYS SOMETHING TO ME. Tucker: SHE CONTRADICTED IT IN A LATER INTERVIEW. MY TAKE-AWAY, OCTOBER 2 THAT SHE WANTED THAT ALLEGATION TO BE INCLUDED THE SCOPE OF THE F.B.I. INVESTIGATION. TO ME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A RIGHT WAY FORWARD ALLOWING FOR THE F.B.I. TO FAIRLY AND IMPARTIALLY CREDIT HER ALLEGATION. HOW WOULD THEY DO THAT SINCE E GAVE HER DECLARATION UNDER OATH. SHE NAMED NO OTHER PERSON PRESENT OTHER THAN PEOPLE WHO ALREADY UNDER OAT DENIED UNDER OATH DENIED SHE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH. THERE WAS NOBODY LEFT TO INTERVIEW BUT HER AND SHE WAS MAKING CLAIMS SO STUPID EVEN SENATORS DIDN'T BELIEVE IT. THERE WERE NOT TEN GOING RAPES IN A ROW AND NOBODY KNEW IT. WHY DIDN'T THEY SAY C'MON, THIS IS NOT HELPFUL. I THINK YOU DID SEE MEMBERS GIVE MORE CREDENCE TO DR. CHRSTINE BLASEY FORD'S TESTIMONY. THE FOCUS ON FORD'S TESTIMONY WAS POEERFUL BECAUSE SHE FORWARD AND TESTIFIED AND THEY COULD ASK HER QUESTIONS. THE BROADER TAKE-AWAY FOR ME IS UNFORTUNATELY THE F.B.I. INVESTIGATION WAS NOT COMPREHENSIVE. IN FACT, JUSTICE KAVANAUGH AND DR. CHRSTINE BLASEY FORD WEREN'T EVEN INTERVIEWED AS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION. SO, I THINK IT WAS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR TO US CLEAR UP A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS. Tucker: I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. ARE YOU SAYING BECAUSE CREEPY PORN LAWYER'S CLIENT CLAIMED TEN CONSECUTIVE GANG RAPES THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AND YOU KNOW IT AS WELL AS I, THAT SHE WASN'T INTERVIEWED FROM THE F.B.I. MEANS HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED. I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE MR. AVENATTI USING THAT TERM. I DON'T WATCH YOUR SHOW. I'M NOT FULLY RIGHT. THE LAWYER WHO REPRESENTED STORMY DANIELS, SAVIOR OF THE REPUBLIC. I'M NOT SURE HE IS A LEADING CANDIDATE. Tucker: HE HAS BEEN INVITED BY DEMOCRATS IN EARLY PRIMARY STATES. ARE YOU SAYING THAT BECAUSE HIS CLIENT, THE TEN GANG RAPE IN A ROW CLIENT, SHE WASN'T INTERVIEWED ABOUT HER LIED CROSS CLAIMS THAT SOMEHOW KAVANAUGH SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED? THAT IS NOT WHAT I SAID. I WISH SHE HAD BEEN INTERVIEW AND THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE LOOKED AT THE STORY AND OFFERED A COMPLETE RECORD. I'M SAYING I THINK WE HAVE A MISSED OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THERE ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS OUTSTANDING BECAUSE THE F.B.I. INVESTIGATION WAS NOT ALLOWED TO BE AS COMPLETE AND HOLISTIC AS I THINK MANY MEMBERS, CERTAINLY THE DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS, YOU SAW THE STATEMENT WISH THEY HAD BEEN. Tucker: QUICKLY BOTTOM LINE IT. JUST ABOUT THE CREEPY PORN LAWYER, C.P.L. COMPONENT. ARE YOU HAPPY TO HAVE HIM IN THE PARTY AND KEEP DOING WHAT HE IS DOING? THAT IS WHAT THE DEMOCRATS STAND FOR OR GO BACK TO DOING WHATEVER HE DOES. WE ARE A BIG TENT PARTY SO I AM HAPPY FOR ANYONE STEPPING UP FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN BUT IT WILL BE A BIG CROWD FIELD SO I'M NOT GOING TO OFFER A FORECAST WHO IS THE NOMINEE. Tucker: I AM ROOTING FOR HIM. I'M NOT A DEMOCRAT BUT I AM
