far-right groups and white supremacists have been outnumbered by an anti-fascist counter protest outside the White House in Washington it was held on the anniversary of the infamous unite the right rally in Charlottesville Virginia that saw bitter clashes between the rival groups the deadly unrest charlottesville deep and political divisions in the u.s. his reminder of how events unfolded back then terrorism is is the use of violence to incite terror and fear and of course it was terrorism this egregious display of hatred bigotry and violence on many sides on many sites and a year after the tragedy some American politicians and I'm suggesting that Russia or was somehow behind the unrest I said in a closed session briefing probably two months ago about Charlottesville with the director of the FBI amongst others and asked if Russian inter meddling had to do with fomenting the flames of what happened in Charlottesville I was told yes it did well he says he got it from an FBI briefing which was not classified information I'd love to hear it so it Erica but it seems kind of bizarre to me that a congressman who says he's not running for re-election because he's having personal problems all of a sudden with a couple of a months left in his term takes the opportunity on CNN which will do anything to bash Trump in to accuse Russia of anything like that was Russia's fault last year well then let's where's the information if it's not classified tell us everything you found out so I don't I don't believe it I'd like this information let's see it but until I see it I'm not gonna go on I'm congressman get garrotxa word so I think that's ridiculous we asked people in Washington for their thoughts on the claim that Russia could be behind these racial divisions in the States do you buy into the idea that it's Russia's fault that the people having the rally over there somehow the fault of Russia Russian BOTS hackers Facebook yet not even a little why do you think that's so big in the mainstream media why are they pushing that so hard that's a good question I don't know I think it kind of it's comforting to hear that this is Russia's fault and not something that's been fleetly wrong with America since the foundation of this country it's nice to say it's Russia's fault and as Trump's fault and that once Trump is gone and once you know the elections are more you know secure then the racism will fade away because the Russian BOTS or the Russian hackers are no longer influencing people to be racist but that's not true it's it's just a nice story you can tell yourself to say this racism and this the white supremacy of the United States is not the fault of the United States the fault of Russia or you know whatever else the media is kind of using the Russia stuff as a way to go after the left says they're saying all these left-wing activists are you know being you know misled by Russia or Russia's behind it and you know even though their genuine grievances to be had with all sorts of things that in Russia plays a minor role if any and you know on the internet do you buy the idea that all this racism and all this division and all these protests are all caused by Russia no I I honestly think it's just what I want to highlight is the intersectionality of what happened today like there were a small amount of white supremacist here but there are a lot of people who are coming to counter protest them so I don't blame Russia well it seems blaming Russia is no bit easier over some of the accusations are so off the wall they need a real good stretch the imagination to be believed you
