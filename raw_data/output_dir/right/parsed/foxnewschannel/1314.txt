>> THANKS.
>> Martha: I HOPE YOU SCORE
A LOT OF GOALS.
BIG NIGHT IN NEW YORK CITY
BUT, FIRST, BREAKING
TONIGHT, "THE STORY" MAKING
NEWS AGAIN, MANY IN THE
MEDIA HAGEL TREY GOWDY'S
APPEARANCE HERE LAST NIGHT
FOR APPARENTLY DEBUNKING
WHAT THE PRESIDENT REFERS TO
AS SPY GATE.
LISTEN.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF
IN THE COMEY MEMO SAID IF
ANYONE CONNECTED WITH MY
CAMPAIGN WAS WORKING WITH
RUSSIA, I WANT YOU TO
INVESTIGATE IT.
AND IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE FBI
DID.
>> Martha: OUR OWN JUDGE
ANDREW NAPOLITANO JOINS US
IN A MOMENT.
HE SHARED A SIM MARCH
OPINION.
>>
SIMILAROPINION.
>> THE TRUMP PEOPLE THINK
THE FBI HAD UNDERCOVER AGENT
AND HIS WAY INTO THE
CAMPAIGN AND SPY ON THE
CAMPAIGN BASELESS.
NO EVIDENCE FOR THAT
WHATSOEVER.
>> Martha: HEAR SOME OF THE
STRONG REACTION FROM THE
MEDIA.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PRIOR
CONSPIRACY THEORY SPY GATE
WAS JUST DEBUNKED ON FOX
NEWS BY G.O.P. LAWMAKER, NO
LESS.
>> GOD BLESS TREY GOWDY FOR
SAYING THIS THAT THE FBI DID
IT BY THE BOOK.
>>
HIS REMARKS ARE ASTOUNDING.
>> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO A
FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST WHO
HAS BEEN A DEFENDER OF THE
PRESIDENT THROUGH AND
THROUGH.
HE CALLED THE PRESIDENT'S
CLAIM BASELESS.
>> NOTHING TO SEE HERE GUYS,
CHILL.
>> EARLIER THIS EVENING I
GOT JUDGE ANDREW
NAPOLITANO'S REACTION.
>> Martha: DO YOU AGREE WITH
THE COMMENTATORS WE JUST
SHOWED THAT YOU ARE CALLING
OUT THE PRESIDENT AND
BASICALLY DEBUNKING HIS
THEORY OF SPY GATE.
>> I'M RELYING ON THE
ACCURACY OF WHAT TREY GOWDY
REPORTED TO YOU AND WHAT
CANDIDLY HE TOLD ME ABOUT
BEFORE THE SHOW STARTED
BECAUSE HE KNEW I WAS GOING
TO BE ON LAST NIGHT TO
COMMENT.
HE HAS A TOP SECRET SECURITY
CLEARANCE.
HE SAW ALL THESE DOCUMENTS.
ASSUMING HE SAW THE RIGHT
DOCUMENTS AND WASN'T MISLEAD
BY DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
ROSENSTEIN OR FBI DIRECTOR
WRAY, WHICH I THINK IS
EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT THEY
WOULD HAVE MISLEAD HIM AND
HE BASICALLY SAID YES, THE
FBI USED AN INFORMANT AND BY
THE BOOK, NO, FBI DID NOT
HAVE A SPY INSIDE THE
CAMPAIGN THE PRESIDENT AND
HIS MOST ARTICULATE
SPOKESPERSON THESE DAYS ON
THE LEGAL SIDE, FORMER MAYOR
GIULIANI HAS BEEN CLAIMING.
SO, YES, I DO AGREE.
>> Martha: YOU AND EVERYBODY
ELSE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND
HAVE SAID THAT A SPY AND
INFORMANT ARE BASICALLY THE
SAME THING DEPENDING ON
WHICH SIDE OF THE FENCE YOU
ARE ON.
>> YES, YES.
>> Martha: WHY ARE THEY
DIFFERENT HERE.
>> SPY IS ANOTHER GUY'S
INFORMANT.
INFORMANT IS YOUR GUY.
COMEY SAID FBI AGENT UNDER
COVER IF BY SPYING THEY MEAN
A HUMAN BEING GOVERNMENT
AGENT PRETENDING TO BE
SOMEBODY ELSE ON THE INSIDE
OF THE CAMPAIGN WHETHER
RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS
PROTECTED.
WHERE THE 40 AMENDMENT
PROTECTS THE CONVERSATION
THEY WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE.
>> Martha: YOU THINK THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN BELIEVES FBI
HIRED PERSON WORKING IN THE
CAMPAIGN?
>> PRETENDING TO BE SOMEBODY
ELSE.
AN AGENT OF THE GOVERNMENT.
FOR THAT THEY NEED A SEARCH
WARRANT.
AND THAT'S WHAT TREY GOWDY
SAYS THERE IS ZERO EVIDENCE
OF.
>> Martha: I'M NOT SURE THAT
THEY HAVE CLEARLY SAID THAT
THEY BELIEF THAT IT WAS
SOMEONE WHO WAS BEING PAID
BY THE FBI AND WHO WAS
WORKING IN THE CAMPAIGN.
ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT THE
SAME PERSON THAT WE'RE ALL
TALKING ABOUT?
SOMEONE WHO IS ON THE
PERIPHERY OF THE CAMPAIGN
WHO WAS, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY
EMAILING OUT OF THE BLUE,
PAPADOPOULOS AND SAYING HEY,
LET'S MEET UP.
I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU.
CLEARLY FISHING TO SEE IF
THE RUSSIANS WERE GOING
AFTER THEM.
AND THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH
THAT BUT AREN'T WE ALL
TALKING ABOUT THE SAME
THING?
>> NOT ONLY IS THERE NO
PROBLEM WITH THAT, IT IS
UNREMARKABLE THAT WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT IT, BECAUSE
THE GOVERNMENT DOES THIS ALL
THE TIME.
RUDY GIULIANI PERFECTED THIS
WHEN HE WAS THE U.S.
ATTORNEY AND WAS UPHELD BY
THE COURTS.
YOU SEND WHO PRETEND TO BE
SOMEBODY OTHER THAN THEY ARE
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION IN A
PUBLIC PLACE.
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.
BECAUSE, IN A PUBLIC PLACE,
THE FOURTH AMENDMENT DOES
NOT PERTAIN.
IF SOMEBODY SHOWS UP AND
SAYS I WANT TO WORK FOR THE
CAMPAIGN AND MAKES HIS WAY
TO THE INSIDE AND THAT
PERSON IS REALLY AN
UNDERCOVER FBI AGENT?
>> Martha: SOME THESE
PERIPHERAL FOLKS ON THE
CAMPAIGN WERE BEING
APPROACHED BY RUSSIANS DID
RUSSIANS COME UP TO SAY AND
I HAVE DIRT ON HILLARY
CLINTON AND DID THEY GO BACK
AND FORTH ON THAT?
>> THOSE ARE LAWFUL
CONVERSATIONS.
>> Martha: ABSOLUTELY.
HERE'S WHAT'S DIFFERENT IN
THIS SITUATION.
THIS IS THE MIDDLE OF A
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN,
RIGHT?
DO ANY DIFFERENT RULES APPLY
GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE
OUTCOME OF THIS MOMENT IS
GOING TO PRODUCE A NEW
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES?
DID THEY HAVE AND YOU SAID
LAST NIGHT THAT'S A JUDGMENT
CALL WHEN I ASKED YOU ABOUT
THAT.
DID THEY HAVE THE ONUS ON
THEM TO SAY AND AS TREY
GOWDY POINTED OUT THE
PRESIDENT SAID LOOK, IF
THERE IS SOMEBODY I OBJECT
FILL TRADING THE CAMPAIGN.
SOMEBODY TRYING TO SPEAK TO
MY FOLKS FROM RUSSIA, I WANT
TO KNOW ABOUT IT.
>> Judge: I REALLY DON'T
KNOW.
I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT IF I
WERE MAKING THE CALLS, I
WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THE
CANDIDATE.
>> Martha: WHY DIDN'T THEY.
>> OR THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER.
THEY MADE A JUDGMENT NOT TO.
>> Martha: WHAT'S THE
MOTIVATION NOT TO?
>> Judge: THEY HAVEN'T SAID.
EITHER THEIR PRESENCE WAS
ILLICIT OR THEY THOUGHT BY
TELLING MORE PEOPLE THAN
NECESSARY THE WORD WOULD GET
OUT.
>> Martha: HOW ABOUT THIS
IDEA THAT IT DRIVES UP YOUR
LEAD INTO THE CAMPAIGN?
>> Judge: IT MAY VERY WELL
DO THAT THAT WOULD BE A VERY
LEGITIMATE LAW ENFORCEMENT
BASED REASON FOR NOT
ANNOUNCING YOUR PRESENCE.
THAT'S A JUDGMENT CALL.
>> Martha: JAMES COMEY SAID
HE WAS COMPELLED HE HAD TO
TELL THE PRESIDENT ABOUT
THAT PIECE.
BUT NOT ANY OF THE OTHER
STUFF.
SO DO THEY MAKE THAT
JUDGMENT CALL AND NOT THE
REST OF THE STORY?
>> YOU ARE ASKING THE WRONG
PERSON.
YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK COMEY
IF HE EVER WAS WILLING TO
SIT HERE.
AS I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT, I
DISAGREE WITH THEIR DECISION
NOT TO TELL TRUMP.
PAUSE, IF I WERE THE
CANDIDATE, I WOULD WANT TO
KNOW.
WAIT A MINUTE, MY CAMPAIGN
IS SURROUNDED BY THE FBI AND
THEY CLAIM THEY ARE HERE TO
PROTECT ME?
I WOULD WANT TO KNOW ABOUT
IT.
>> Martha: REASON IT RAISES
ALL THESE QUESTIONS FOR THE
PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE KNOWS
THE PEOPLE RUNNING THE
INVESTIGATION WERE SAYING
ALL THESE NASTY THINGS ABOUT
HIM IN A TEXT MESSAGES.
>> RIGHT.
>> Martha: MORE THAN THAT.
>> AGAIN, WE ARE TALKING
ABOUT THE PROFESSOR, WHOSE
NAME WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO
USE HERE, HAVING
CONVERSATIONS IN PUBLIC
PLACES WITH CARTER PAGE,
WITH SAM CLOVIS, WITH GEORGE
PAPADOPOULOS.
>> Martha: NOTHING ILLEGAL
ABOUT THAT.
>> CORRECT.
TALKING ABOUT A HUMAN BEING
WHO MADE IT TO THE INSIDE OF
THE CAMPAIGN.
>> Martha: THAT'S DIFFERENT.
>> THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A
CAMPAIGN WORKER AND THOUGHT
IT WAS AN FBI AGENT.
THEY NEED A SEARCH WARRANT
FOR THAT AND FOR THAT THERE
IS NO EVIDENCE.
>> Martha: JEFF SESSIONS,
THE PRESIDENT SAYS YOU KNOW
WHAT?
I SHOULDN'T HAVE HIRED HIM
THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD
LAWYERS OUT THERE.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT.
IT PAINS ME TO SAY IT
BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN A FRIEND
OF MINE FOR 20 YEARS.
THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT.
THE PRESIDENT IS ENTITLED TO
AN ATTORNEY GENERAL WITH
WHOM HE HAS AN OPEN
CONVERSATION, AN OPEN LEVEL
OF COMMUNICATION WITH GREAT
CONFIDENCE.
SORT OF LIKE BOBBY AND JACK
KENNEDY HAD.
ALMOST -- MITCHELL WENT TO
JAIL.
LIKE NIXON AND MITCHELL HAD.
INFINITE LEVEL OF
COMMUNICATION.
NOT ONE WHERE THE PRESIDENT
IS AFRAID OF WHAT HE IS
