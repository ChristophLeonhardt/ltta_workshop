for some reason that I cannot understand it is not massive news today that Donald Trump has pushed multiple times for an invasion of Venezuela now that sounds crazy but it has been confirmed confirmed now just by US government officials but also by officials of other countries as well he's done this he's done this multiple times he has done this despite the fact that many people around him people who I disagree with on foreign policy as well have cautioned him that this is a horrific idea but he is continuing to do it let's talk about how this began it started at a meeting last fall where he was talking with aides about sanctions on Venezuela and near the end of that meeting he said this why do sanctions why not just invade them now at the time HR McMaster and others took turns explaining to Trump how military action could backfire but Trump pushed back although he gave no indication he was about to order up military plans he pointed to what he considered past cases of successful gunboat diplomacy in the region according to the official who was on the record on this like the invasions of Panama and Grenada in the 1980s so referencing a couple of the many interventions that the US has historically done in Latin in South America we look back on those as horrific over reaches of American power that destabilized these countries in many cases they are the reason that we are experiencing the asylum crisis that we are today now Donald Trump he sees that as a pattern for future diplomacy which I call an invasion because that's what he was interested in and by the way so he had that one meeting and then they pushed back against him the next day August 11th Trump alarmed friends and foes alike with talk of a military option to remove the president of Venezuela from power shortly afterward he raised the issue again with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos two high-ranking Colombian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid antagonizing Trump confirmed that report in September Trump discussed it again this time at greater length than a private dinner with leaders from four Latin American allies who included the President of Colombia again the US official said Trump was specifically briefed not to raise the issue and told it wouldn't play well but the first thing the president said at the dinner was my staff told me not to say this Trump then went around asking each leader whether they were sure they didn't want a military solution according to the official who added that each leader told Trump in clear terms that they were sure they did not want to invade Venezuela the white house has been reached about these multiple times they've pushed for this invasion they have not provided any sort of response or comment on this but a National Security Council spokesman reiterated that the US will consider all options at its disposal and literally as of last week US Vice President Mike Pence told reporters the US will not stand idly by while Venezuela collapses I saw one article on Fox News about this the AP wrote an article which is awesome that has been spread on some sites and other than that the sound of silence that the president United States has multiple times repeatedly pushed for an invasion of Venezuela besides now why what is it's happening in Venezuela I mean again the time out going down the path of a dictatorship under module right so what's the answer that's what Trump inand been pensar saying that we're not going to allow them to have a dictatorship so invasion does what for that it completely up ends everything of course because of course you know where the United States it's not like we're gonna go into Venezuela and we're gonna you know be beat in night yeah so the point is to then do what afterwards I mean we already see the pattern for for the knee-jerk policies and agenda that that mainly headed by Trump now does and by the way his people a lot of times had have bad pauses and approaches to agendas have to tell him hey this one isn't gonna make much sense there guy yeah this one isn't really gonna work out for you um and again Rex Tillerson was one of the guys who was trying to war him against it when he was in a Secretary of State it's probably what the time when he called him an effing moron you don't remember that part which of course he was angry about that and I think was part of the fallout anyway goes there's no thought process as to how this would continue down after then invading he goes you got you don't wanna date I'm gonna talk to all these Latin American leaders and good okay you want invade I know you wanted they don't you know if we invade those that you guys can just kind of say you're a part of it and then we'll invade and you'll be happy right there's people say well how does that work what happens next this is never the thought the first thought is strong-arming they're proving your will and stomping on someone afterwards been like all the dictatorship is over just like his meeting on June 12th we can kim jeong-hoon hey it's all over hey you guys I tweeted about it it's all over because I sat down and and and kiss this guy's yeah yeah and look there have been a number of times that Maduro and Trump have launched bombs each other social media and speeches and all that ironically in terms of their personal relationship the only way I can see going forward that they will get along is if Maduro did somehow become a dictator then Trump would love him because that's the sort of person that he likes to do it that's not obviously the situation it frustrates me to no end that no one is talking about this they're still pushing for this Mike Pence is going around trying to rally support for this they might have been scared away by the lack of interest of our other Latin American allies but this is very much on Donald Trump's mind you know he was thinking about this then he got him pardons for a little bit maybe singing about some elections I know how his mind works he's gonna circle back around to this and for some reason I don't know if it's because we have such a low bar for him or we don't put any stock in what he says even though very often it ends up that he pursues these sorts of things that no one is paying attention to this is absurd and we could well be on the road to war with Venezuela and no one is doing anything to ward it off it is incredibly frustrating incredibly scary and people in the media should know better and should do better you can't else publicly a pushback on it who knows Mike Pence might think this is insane but my pence his his whole is I think his whole agenda right now is to sit back and let Trump do whatever he wants and kiss his butt and do do it that way so you can continue to have some kind of reign of power yeah it's all there is to it perhaps so no one's gonna stop it because who cares why not America it'll it'll all work out in the end with no plan it's what happened with the separation of families this is why it's the simple minded approach to everything that they do it's okay just be real mean you said it before he goes the dilemma is either being really nice which isn't the case be really nice and just getting getting walked all over or to be really mean and strong and then get considered a bad guy but no there's there's there's another option but he thinks that's his approach to everything and everything would just fall into place because we're a married we have over 900 days left of his presidency at this point and that was zooming that things work out well the next time we're playing about the Iraq war and however much of a mess that is but he thinks that another war as long as he's the one who's saying she's it isn't gonna be a mess I know that people people wanted to live this fantasy that he was gonna be a non-interventionist I said multiple times I quoted him before the election he said I am the most militaristic person in the world I know that's a juvenile thing to say it's ridiculous he said it okay anyway hopefully we won't invade Venezuela that would be nice maybe we can cruise through to the midterms without a war course if you want to raise your numbers we know how the American public responds to military conflict well if we is it impossible well if we do he'll get some points for it for sure from a lot of folks but hey you know at least they didn't go into that war he's fighting socialists I can see it now I'm sure Tucker Carlson really really ranked him over the coals for starting an unnecessary
