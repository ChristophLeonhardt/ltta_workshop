1
00:00:01,628 --> 00:00:04,998
DOWN HERE THIS MORNING.

2
00:00:04,998 --> 00:00:05,365
JESSE?

3
00:00:05,365 --> 00:00:05,999
>> Jesse: THANKS, CASEY.

4
00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:08,235
ALL RIGHT, KIMBERLY JUST SO

5
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:09,369
YOU KNOW ANOTHER HORRIBLE

6
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:10,871
TRAGEDY ON A FRIDAY IN THIS

7
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:12,239
COUNTRY IT SEEMS LIKE ALMOST

8
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:14,675
ONCE A MONTH AT THIS POINT.

9
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:16,877
WHAT JUMPS OUT AT YOU AFTER

10
00:00:16,877 --> 00:00:19,546
YOU HEAR SOMETHING LIKE

11
00:00:19,546 --> 00:00:19,847
THIS?

12
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:20,948
ANYTHING SPECIFIC AND

13
00:00:20,948 --> 00:00:21,648
ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN

14
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:23,917
REFLECT ON FOR THE AUDIENCE?

15
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:24,585
>> Kimberly: YEAH, WHEN YOU

16
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:26,286
THINK ABOUT IT, CAN YOU FEEL

17
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:28,555
IT, RIGHT?

18
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:28,989
IT'S HEAVY.

19
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:30,491
YOU HATE TO REPORT ON A

20
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:33,127
STORY LIKE THIS FAMILY

21
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:33,861
MEMBERS.

22
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:35,362
PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING.

23
00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:36,196
INCLUDING PARENTS OF EVEN

24
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:37,431
THE SHOOTER IN TERMS OF WHAT

25
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:38,699
HAPPENED, WHAT WENT WRONG.

26
00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:39,700
PEOPLE THINKING TO

27
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,667
THEMSELVES A SENSE OF GUILT

28
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:41,568
AND RESPONSIBILITY.

29
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:43,270
WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE TO

30
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,538
PREVENT SOMETHING, YOU KNOW,

31
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:44,905
LIKE THIS.

32
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:47,407
THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES IS

33
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:47,875
HEART-BREAKING.

34
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,042
THOSE INJURED AND THOUGHTS

35
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:50,177
AND PRAYERS TO THE FAMILIES

36
00:00:50,177 --> 00:00:51,745
AND ALSO TO THE HOSPITALS,

37
00:00:51,745 --> 00:00:53,480
YOU KNOW, WORKERS, THE

38
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,048
NURSES, THE DOCTORS.

39
00:00:55,048 --> 00:00:55,983
EVERYBODY WHO MOVED IN TO

40
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:57,584
TRY TO SAVE LIVES SO THAT

41
00:00:57,584 --> 00:01:02,556
THERE WEREN'T EVEN MORE

42
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:02,956
FATALITIES.

43
00:01:02,956 --> 00:01:04,090
I KNOW IN TERMS OF THE

44
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,159
INVESTIGATION THEY REALLY DO

45
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,426
HAVE TO DO A DEEP DIVE INTO

46
00:01:06,426 --> 00:01:07,895
HIS SOCIAL MEDIA, INTO THINK

47
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:09,163
KIND OF MOTIVE, MENTAL

48
00:01:09,163 --> 00:01:09,630
STATE.

49
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,998
BUT, ALSO IS THERE ANYONE

50
00:01:10,998 --> 00:01:12,065
ELSE THAT HE COMMUNICATED

51
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:12,399
WITH?

52
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:13,534
THEY WERE ALSO GOING TO BE

53
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:14,968
QUESTIONING A COUPLE OTHER

54
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:15,302
PEOPLE.

55
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:15,969
THEY ARE CONCERNED AND THEY

56
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:17,271
SET UP A VERY LARGE

57
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:19,039
PERIMETER IN CASE THERE ARE

58
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:22,743
ANY EXPLOSIVE DEVICES THAT

59
00:01:22,743 --> 00:01:25,078
HAD BEEN SECLUDED AROUND THE

60
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:26,213
AREA OF THE PROPERTY OR

61
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:27,214
SCHOOL THAT COULD STILL

62
00:01:27,214 --> 00:01:27,815
CAUSE HARM.

63
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:29,883
RIGHT AWAY YOU GOING TO BE

64
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:31,084
WANTING TO QUESTION THIS

65
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:32,286
INDIVIDUAL TO DETERMINE THAT

66
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:33,687
THERE IS NO FURTHER LOSS OF

67
00:01:33,687 --> 00:01:34,955
LIFE OR CASUALTY IN A

68
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:35,522
SITUATION LIKE THIS.

69
00:01:35,522 --> 00:01:36,924
AND YOU SEE KIND OF THE

70
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:37,858
ELEVATION SHOTS THAT THEY'RE

71
00:01:37,858 --> 00:01:39,059
GOING TO DO THAT AND REALLY

72
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:40,327
CHECK THE AREA TO MAKE SURE

73
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:41,461
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING ELSE

74
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:44,164
THAT DOESN'T GO UNDETECTED.

75
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:45,032
>> Jesse: HE WAS SUPPOSED TO

76
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:46,333
TAKE HIS LIFE.

77
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,701
DID HE NOT TAKE HIS OWN LIFE

78
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:48,502
AND HE IS IN CRITICAL

79
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:48,969
CONDITION.

80
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:50,037
SO, LAW ENFORCEMENT, GREG,

81
00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:51,638
GOING TO BE ABLE TO

82
00:01:51,638 --> 00:01:52,973
INTERROGATE HIM PRETTY

83
00:01:52,973 --> 00:01:53,373
THOROUGHLY.

84
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:53,707
>> YEAH.

85
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:55,576
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM

86
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:56,076
HIM.

87
00:01:56,076 --> 00:01:57,444
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE DID THIS

88
00:01:57,444 --> 00:01:59,913
FUN STORY FOR THE LAST

89
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:02,049
COUPLE DAYS THE LAUREL AND

90
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:02,616
YANNY THING.

91
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:04,084
I CAN'T HELP BUT SEE EVERY

92
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:05,118
NEWS STORY THROUGH THAT

93
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:05,419
PRISM.

94
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:06,587
EVERYBODY GOES INTO THEIR

95
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:07,855
SEPARATE SIDES.

96
00:02:07,855 --> 00:02:09,156
IT'S EITHER LAUREL, WHICH IS

97
00:02:09,156 --> 00:02:11,191
WE NEED MORE ARMED SECURITY

98
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:12,359
OR IT'S YANNY, THERE ARE TOO

99
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:14,194
MANY GUNS.

100
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:15,863
AND IT'S TOO MANY GUNS

101
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:19,533
VERSUS NOT ENOUGH ONLY WAY

102
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:20,868
TO GET THROUGH THIS STUFF

103
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:22,369
AND MOVE BEYOND IT IS GET

104
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:23,871
OUT OF THIS PRISON OF TWO

105
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:24,204
IDEAS.

106
00:02:24,204 --> 00:02:25,772
AND ACTUALLY SEEK A

107
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:27,040
COMPROMISE FROM BOTH SIDES

108
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,709
TO LOOK AT OKAY, WHAT

109
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:29,409
EFFECTIVE GUN CONTROL

110
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:30,310
MEASURE WOULD WORK?

111
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,712
I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT A SYSTEM

112
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:33,347
THAT TAGS CERTAIN PEOPLE

113
00:02:33,347 --> 00:02:35,249
CONSIDERED TO BE HIGH RISK

114
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:37,885
BY TEACHERS AND AUTHORITIES.

115
00:02:37,885 --> 00:02:39,286
A CIVIL COURT THAT TAGS THIS

116
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:40,387
PERSON SO THEY CAN'T HAVE

117
00:02:40,387 --> 00:02:40,687
GUNS.

118
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:42,289
THE PROBLEM IS WITH THIS GUY

119
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:43,891
HE GOT THE GUNS FROM HIS

120
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:44,224
PARENTS.

121
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:44,858
SO HE GETS THROUGH.

122
00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:46,293
SO THE OTHER THING THEN IS

123
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:47,961
TO TRAIN MORE ARMED

124
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:48,395
PERSONNEL.

125
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:50,063
BECAUSE THE VARIABLE THAT

126
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:51,531
EFFECTS CASUALTY RATE IS THE

127
00:02:51,531 --> 00:02:53,533
DURATION BETWEEN THE FIRST

128
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:55,702
GUN THAT IS UNHOLSTERRED AND

129
00:02:55,702 --> 00:02:57,070
THE SECOND GUN THAT ARRIVES

130
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,172
TO STOP HIM IF IT INDEED

131
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:00,340
STOPS HIM OR ANY KIND OF

132
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,875
HARD TARGET.

133
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,510
>> Kimberly: THE RESPONSE

134
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:03,911
WEAPON.

135
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:04,478
>> Greg: THESE ARE TWO

136
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:05,545
THINGS THAT COME FROM TWO

137
00:03:05,545 --> 00:03:05,846
AREAS.

138
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:07,581
ONE COMES FROM GUN CONTROL

139
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:09,049
WHEN WHICH IS A COURT THAT

140
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:10,284
PROVIDES A CIVIC TAG AND

141
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:11,885
THEN YOU ALSO HAVE ARMED

142
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:13,253
PERSONNEL WHICH IS WHAT

143
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:14,288
PEOPLE BELIEVE ENHANCES

144
00:03:14,288 --> 00:03:15,255
FREEDOM AND SECURITY IS TO

145
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:16,323
HAVE SOMEBODY THERE WHO

146
00:03:16,323 --> 00:03:17,190
KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

147
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,792
THE THIRD THING, AS ALWAYS,

148
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:19,393
IS THE MEDIA.

149
00:03:19,393 --> 00:03:20,761
AND THE MEDIA HAS TO BE

150
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:23,664
AWARE THAT BLANKET COVERAGE

151
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:24,598
CREATES INCENTIVE FOR MORE

152
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:26,967
OF THESE EVENTS BECAUSE IT

153
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:28,235
CREATES INFAMY.

154
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:29,670
AND THIS IS ABOUT INFAMY.

155
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,038
THIS IS NOT LIKE STREET

156
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:31,338
CRIME.

157
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:32,906
THIS IS THE TYPE OF CRIME

158
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:35,842
THAT IS SYMBOLIC NILISTIC

159
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:37,077
ACT THAT THE PERSON DOES SO

160
00:03:37,077 --> 00:03:38,645
THEY CAN LIVE FOREVER.

161
00:03:38,645 --> 00:03:39,579
AND IN OUR HEADS.

162
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,181
AND IT WORKS BECAUSE WE

163
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:42,249
CONSTANTLY DO BLANKET

164
00:03:42,249 --> 00:03:42,616
COVERAGE.

165
00:03:42,616 --> 00:03:43,784
SO IF WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW

166
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:44,985
TO PULL BACK FROM THIS AND

167
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:46,219
NOT TALK ABOUT THIS PERSON

168
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:47,554
AND NOT MENTION HIS NAME

169
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:48,455
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST GOING TO

170
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:49,356
CREATE MORE OF THEM.

171
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:52,159
IS HE TRENDING ON TWITTER.

172
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:52,826
>> Jesse: HE IS.

173
00:03:52,826 --> 00:03:53,627
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

174
00:03:53,627 --> 00:03:55,862
PEOPLE WERE ALARMED BY,

175
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:58,098
DANIEL, IS HE HAD THIS BIG

176
00:03:58,098 --> 00:03:59,366
TRENCH COAT IN TEXAS, WHICH

177
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:00,200
IS VERY HOT.

178
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,234
PEOPLE SAID WHY ARE YOU

179
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:03,170
WEARING A TRENCH COAT?

180
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:03,971
>> Dana: APPARENTLY THOUGH,

181
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:04,938
I HAD OPPORTUNITY TO ANCHOR

182
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:06,073
THE HOURS WITH TRACE

183
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:07,874
GALLAGHER AND ONE OF THE

184
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:08,742
PEOPLE -- ONE OF THE

185
00:04:08,742 --> 00:04:09,977
STUDENTS THAT WE INTERVIEWED

186
00:04:09,977 --> 00:04:11,378
SHE SAID HE WORE THE TRENCH

187
00:04:11,378 --> 00:04:11,979
COAT EVERY DAY.

188
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:13,413
WHAT WAS DIFFERENT TODAY WAS

189
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:15,215
THAT HE WORE A T-SHIRT UNDER

190
00:04:15,215 --> 00:04:17,384
NEATH IT THAT SAID BORN TO

191
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:17,884
KILL.

192
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:19,753
>> Jesse: OH, GOD.

193
00:04:19,753 --> 00:04:22,889
>> Dana: IT WAS INTERESTING

194
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:23,623
INTERVIEWING THOSE STUDENTS.

195
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:25,092
ALL THREE OF THEM WERE YOUNG

196
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:25,392
WOMEN.

197
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:27,361
THEY ARE SO POISED.

198
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:28,595
>> Jesse: ISN'T THAT

199
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:29,129
AMAZING.

200
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:30,230
>> Dana: MATURE AND

201
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,932
ARTICULATE AND ABLE TO PUT

202
00:04:31,932 --> 00:04:32,666
THEIR THOUGHTS TOGETHER.

203
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,968
I THINK IT WAS VERY

204
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:36,303
DISTURBING AND PARENTS ALL

205
00:04:36,303 --> 00:04:37,971
OF THEM SAID THEY WEREN'T

206
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:38,739
ENTIRELY SURPRISED.

207
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:39,940
THEY SORT OF EXPECTED THIS

208
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,108
MIGHT HAPPEN TO THEM

209
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:42,409
BECAUSE, AS GREG WAS JUST

210
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,077
SAYING WE COVER THEM AND IT

211
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:49,549
HAPPENS ALL TOO OFTEN OTHER

212
00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:50,984
THING SIMILAR THEY HAD JUST

213
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:52,419
DONE FIRE DRILLS AND ACTIVE

214
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:53,220
SHOOTER DRILLS AT THIS

215
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,654
SCHOOL AND THEY HAD SOME

216
00:04:54,654 --> 00:04:55,455
RESOURCES ACTUALLY THAT THEY

217
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:56,356
HAD TAKEN FROM THE STATE IN

218
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:57,557
ORDER TO GET THAT DONE.

219
00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:58,892
I ASKED ONE OF THEM DO YOU

220
00:04:58,892 --> 00:05:00,260
THINK IT HELPED TO SAVE

221
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:00,560
LIVES?

222
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,495
AND SHE SAID ABSOLUTELY

223
00:05:01,495 --> 00:05:02,863
BECAUSE THEY KNEW WHAT TO DO

224
00:05:02,863 --> 00:05:04,564
AND ONE OF THE TEACHERS, THE

225
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:05,799
BAND TEACHER WAS ACTUALLY

226
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:07,300
ABLE TO PUT THEM UP INTO A

227
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,769
ROOM THAT HAS A SOLID

228
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:09,803
CONCRETE WALL SO THAT NOBODY

229
00:05:09,803 --> 00:05:11,405
CAN HEAR THE MUSIC BEING

230
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:11,838
PLAYED.

231
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:14,207
SO THAT TEACHER WAS VERY

232
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:14,674
QUICK-THINKING.

233
00:05:14,674 --> 00:05:16,176
THE HOSPITAL HAD ALSO JUST

234
00:05:16,176 --> 00:05:17,411
DONE A DRILL.

235
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:18,745
SO, THEY ARE LEVEL ONE

236
00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:20,781
TRAUMA CENTER SO THEY WERE

237
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:22,983
ABLE TO SAVE LIVES VERY

238
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:23,717
QUICKLY.

239
00:05:23,717 --> 00:05:24,584
GREG INMADE THIS POINT VERY

240
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:25,285
WELL BEFORE.

241
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:26,420
ON ALL ENDS, LAW

242
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,254
ENFORCEMENT, SCHOOLS AND THE

243
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:28,722
MEDICAL TEAMS, IN

244
00:05:28,722 --> 00:05:30,223
PARTICULAR, MODERN MEDICINE

245
00:05:30,223 --> 00:05:31,258
IS AMAZING BUT BECAUSE THEY

246
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:32,426
HAVE DONE THESE DRILLS, THEY

247
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:33,860
ARE ABLE TO SAVE A LOT MORE

248
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,728
LIVES MORE QUICKLY.

249
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:37,764
I ALSO WOULD POINT PEOPLE TO

250
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:38,799
LOOKING TO CHARLES COOK.

251
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:40,567
HE WRITES ON NATIONAL REVIEW

252
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,969
ABOUT THIS OBSESSION OF

253
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,104
COPYING THE COLUMBINE HIGH

254
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:45,839
SCHOOL SHOOTERS.

255
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,374
IT'S ALMOST TEXTBOOK.

256
00:05:47,374 --> 00:05:49,042
AND YOU CAN GO THROUGH IT'S

257
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:49,810
VERY CHILLING WHEN YOU LOOK

258
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,578
AT IT AND BECOMES A LITTLE

259
00:05:51,578 --> 00:05:52,646
BIT OF THE THING IF WE'RE

260
00:05:52,646 --> 00:05:53,713
GOING TO BE IN THIS PRISON

261
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:55,015
OF TWO IDEAS WE ARE GOING TO

262
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:55,982
HAVE THIS FIGHT.

263
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:57,050
IN THE MEANTIME IT'S ALMOST

264
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,385
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO

265
00:05:58,385 --> 00:05:59,586
STOP IT BECAUSE THEY ARE

266
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:00,954
ONLINE AND THEY ARE DOING

267
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:01,288
THIS.

268
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:02,222
THE ONLY POSSIBLE THING THAT

269
00:06:02,222 --> 00:06:03,723
YOU COULD DO, MORE DRILLS

270
00:06:03,723 --> 00:06:07,094
AND HARDENING OF TARGET.

271
00:06:07,094 --> 00:06:07,761
CONGRESSMAN MICHAEL MCCAUL

272
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:08,762
FROM THAT DISTRICT.

273
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:10,197
THIS IS SUCH A SMALL WORLD

274
00:06:10,197 --> 00:06:11,665
THING, JUST YESTERDAY HE

275
00:06:11,665 --> 00:06:12,666
INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT

276
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,202
WOULD PROVIDE FOR GRANTS AND

277
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:16,403
MONEY FOR SCHOOLS ACROSS THE

278
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:17,804
COUNTRY TO TAKE ACTIONS AS

279
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:19,906
THEY SEE FIT BUT INCLUDING

280
00:06:19,906 --> 00:06:22,275
CERTAINLY THESE TYPES OF

281
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:22,609
DRILLS.

282
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:23,877
AND THEN I SAID WOULD THAT

283
00:06:23,877 --> 00:06:25,078
MONEY BE TIED TO ANYTHING IN

284
00:06:25,078 --> 00:06:25,479
PARTICULAR?

285
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:26,012
HE SAID NO.

286
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:27,881
THE LAST ONE I WOULD MAKE IS

287
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:29,349
THAT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR

288
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:30,283
GAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE AND

289
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:31,518
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE

290
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:32,686
SAID IS THAT THIS SHOOTER

291
00:06:32,686 --> 00:06:35,155
TOOK THE GUN FROM THE

292
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:35,489
FATHER.

293
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:37,157
HE IS ONLY 17 YEARS OLD.

294
00:06:37,157 --> 00:06:38,258
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE

295
00:06:38,258 --> 00:06:40,360
THE GUN IN ANY WAY.

296
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,129
THEY JUST IMPLORED PARENTS

297
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:43,063
IF YOU HAVE WEAPONS THAT YOU

298
00:06:43,063 --> 00:06:44,531
LEGALLY OWN, MAKE SURE THAT

299
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:45,732
THEY ARE LOCKED UP AND THAT

300
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:46,800
YOUR CHILDREN CAN'T GET

301
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,934
AHOLD OF THEM.

302
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:48,468
>> Jesse: THAT'S AN

303
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:49,236
EXCELLENT POINT.

304
00:06:49,236 --> 00:06:51,004
THE WEAPONS HE USED A 38

305
00:06:51,004 --> 00:06:54,441
REVOLVER AND A SHOTGUN.

306
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:54,774
RICHARD.

307
00:06:54,774 --> 00:06:58,345
RICHARD:  I THINK DANA IS

308
00:06:58,345 --> 00:06:58,645
RIGHT.

309
00:06:58,645 --> 00:06:59,679
I PULLED A QUOTE FROM A

310
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:00,780
YOUNG WOMAN.

311
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,815
NO, THERE WASN'T.

312
00:07:01,815 --> 00:07:03,150
IT'S BEEN HAPPENING ALL

313
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:03,450
OVER.

314
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,851
I HAVE ALWAYS KIND OF FELT

315
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:06,052
LIKE EVENTUALLY IT WAS GOING

316
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:06,853
TO HAPPEN HERE.

317
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:08,388
I WASN'T SURPRISED.

318
00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:11,291
I WAS JUST SCARED.

319
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,226
AND AS I WATCHED HER

320
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:14,661
INTERVIEW AND AS I WAS

321
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:15,629
PREPARING FOR THE SHOW, THAT

322
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:16,530
QUOTE STUCK OUT TO ME

323
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,064
BECAUSE I THINK I'M ONE OF

324
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:19,533
THE YOUNGER FOLKS AT THIS

325
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:21,568
TABLE AND I WAS JUST LIKE I

326
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:23,003
LITERALLY GRADUATED FROM

327
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:26,173
COLLEGE 10 YEARS AGO, AND WE

328
00:07:26,173 --> 00:07:27,741
NEVER HAD ACTIVE SHOOTER

329
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:28,642
TRAININGS WHEN I WAS IN HIGH

330
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:30,143
SCHOOL AND THAT WAS 14 YEARS

331
00:07:30,143 --> 00:07:30,810
AGO.

332
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,646
AND TO THINK THAT THESE

333
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:34,581
YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY ARE

334
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:36,416
SAYING AT 17, LIKE I ALMOST

335
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,751
EXPECTED IT TO HAPPEN AT MY

336
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:38,084
SCHOOL.

337
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:39,452
AND SO WHEN IT HAPPENED, I

338
00:07:39,452 --> 00:07:40,253
WASN'T SCARED.

339
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:42,289
TO ME, THIS IS SOMETHING HAS

340
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:43,490
GOT TO GIVE IN THIS COUNTRY

341
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,559
THAT WE HAVE GOT TO REALLY

342
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:46,726
DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER

343
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:47,894
AS ADULTS AND AS LAWMAKERS

344
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:49,062
AND AS PEOPLE OF INFLUENCE

345
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:50,330
TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY

346
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,198
SINGLE SCHOOL IN THIS

347
00:07:51,198 --> 00:07:53,266
COUNTRY IS SAFE, WELCOMING,

348
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,068
AND THRIVING.

349
00:07:55,202 --> 00:07:56,503
WE HAVE GOT TO MEET IN THE

350
00:07:56,503 --> 00:07:56,836
MIDDLE.

351
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:58,572
PART OF IT IS HOW WE HARDEN

352
00:07:58,572 --> 00:07:59,506
SOFT TARGETS AND THE OTHER

353
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:01,908
PART IS HOW WE RESTRICT

354
00:08:01,908 --> 00:08:03,043
ACCESS TO GUNS.

355
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:03,343
RIGHT?

356
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:04,444
AND PART OF IT IS MAKING

357
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:05,579
SURE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

358
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:07,547
GUNS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND

359
00:08:07,547 --> 00:08:08,548
MAKING SURE IF YOU ARE A GUN

360
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:09,549
OWNER AND PARENT AND HAVE

361
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:10,750
YOU YOUNG PEOPLE IN YOUR

362
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,918
HOUSE, YOU LOCK THOSE GUNS

363
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:13,720
UP SO THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS

364
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,721
TO THEM.

365
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:15,388
>> Kimberly: AND MENTALLY

366
00:08:15,388 --> 00:08:15,722
STABLE.

367
00:08:15,722 --> 00:08:16,256
>> ABSOLUTELY.

368
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:17,557
AND THE OTHER PART IS

369
00:08:17,557 --> 00:08:18,258
FIXING, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID

370
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:20,393
IT HIMSELF, MAKING SURE WE

371
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:21,661
COMMIT TO FIXING THE

372
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:22,862
BACKGROUND SYSTEM.

373
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:24,331
>> Dana: IN THIS CASE IN

374
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:24,731
PARTICULAR.

375
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:26,600
>> IT WOULDN'T HAVE SOLVED

376
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,968
IT AND I THINK THE OTHER

377
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:29,436
THING THAT MAKES THIS EVEN

378
00:08:29,436 --> 00:08:31,371
MORE SOBERING FOR ME IS THAT

379
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:33,006
THIS WEEKEND FOR THESE YOUNG

380
00:08:33,006 --> 00:08:34,441
PEOPLE IS GRADUATION

381
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:34,774
WEEKEND.

382
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:37,409
AND SO SOME -- AND A WE ARE

383
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,345
GOING TO HEAR MORE STORIES

384
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:39,479
AS WE GO INTO THIS WEEKEND

385
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,380
