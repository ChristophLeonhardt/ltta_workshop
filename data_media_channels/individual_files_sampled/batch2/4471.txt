I understood early that Facebook was how Donald Trump is going to win Twitter is how he talked to the people Facebook was gonna be how you want I think Donald Trump won but I think Facebook is was the method it was the high way in which his car drove on this week we learned a little bit more about how your top source for baby pics and engagement photos turned into a political battleground Facebook has banned Cambridge analytic affirm that ran the Trump campaigns data operations after reports emerged that the firm accessed the private information of more than 50 million users without permission Cambridge analytical has been backed by Trump mega donor Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon was once its vice president last fall special counsel robert muller asked for the emails of any cambridge analytical employees who worked on the Trump campaign in a series of interviews former employee turned whistleblower Christopher Wylie described how the firm weaponized personal data to wage a culture war we would know what kinds of messaging you would be susceptible to including the framing of it the topics the contents the tone whether it's scary or not that kind of thing websites will be created blogs will be created whatever it is that we think this target profile will be receptive to we will create content on the internet for them to find and then they see that and they click it and they go down the rabbit hole in a statement to NBC News camera general Anika denied Wiley's claims joining me now a Natasha Bertrand staff writer for The Atlantic Gabriel Sherman special correspondent for Vanity Fair and Curt bard Ella who's a former Breitbart media consultant and I want to start by playing another bite from mr. Wiley who spoke to the Guardian and this is about how Cambridge analytic I went about gathering up all of your data take a look have you joins the app I would not just see your Facebook profile I would see all of the Facebook profiles of everybody that you're friends with we would only need two to zero touch 400,000 people to expand into their entire social network which would then scale us to you know most of America those profiles were used as the basis of the algorithms that became the foundation of Cambridge on melodica itself you know Gabriel you know this mr. Wylie has said that in a sense Cambridge analytical developed psychographic profiles about 230 million Americans by extrapolating by saying this group of people said yes to the app downloaded it and gave their data but Facebook then gave all of their friends data who didn't give permission and so they're building these cyclic psychographic profiles and then using that to target you with just the thing that will get you yeah change your mind this is psychological warfare yeah how is it legal for this to be done through Facebook well really joy you raise a great point I think the the regulation is a complete gray area it's the Wild West as Facebook has slowly come to acknowledge they're just happy to rake in the money from the advertising platform that they've created and listen the only way companies change we know they're not altruistic they change either because their customers revolt or the government comes in and says you can't do this in the case of Facebook unfortunately the American people have decided even after all their data is being sold off and used against them they're still happy to use Facebook so now this is making the case that the government needs to take some action yeah and let's talk about what the what the Trump campaign actually got out of Cambridge analytic ah and this is three for my producers I didn't warn you in advance under the guidance of Brad Pascal who you just saw on the screen a little earlier Cambridge performed a variety of services former campaign officials said it included designing target audiences for digital ads fundraising appeals modeling voter turnout buying five million dollars in television ads and determining where Trump should travel to best drum up support Brad Parr scale who used Cambridge analytical to do these things is now going to be running the 2020 Trump campaign how worried should Americans be that their data is going to be manipulated and stolen again Brad parse Cal who directed the data operation under the purview of Jared Kushner this is something that adds an entirely new dimension to Muller's investigation it really raises questions about whether or not anything illegal has done during the election in terms of harvesting 50 million profiles on Facebook in order to target voters better and I think that one aspect of this that's really really interesting is that the person who created kind of who is the liaison between Cameron John ludica and Facebook who kind of helped develop this this software for lack of a better word to obtain this data was a Russian American based in st. Petersburg and there has been of course more reporting done on cameras analytic has ties to Russia we found out that as early as 2014 this Russian oil company was asking Cambridge analytic our SEL group that the parent company hey how can we learn more about the political targeting of American voters yeah there was a lot of confusion surrounding why a Russian oil company wanted to know how to target voters in the United States so these ties go back really these ties to Russia go back and they have been vehemently denied by Cambridge analytical and we just one more point on that I think there's a lot of speculation this has not been corroborated but that if somehow the Russian government or Russian state actors got a hold of the Trump campaign voter file and the psychographic profiles that Cambridge analytic I had made they could augment and amplify these messages by putting their bot army behind it which might be sort of a force multiplier of the Trump message yeah absolutely let's just look at the sort of organizational chart of the ties between Cambridge analytic and Trump or 'obviously of Robert Mercer and his daughter Becca the big Trump donors were invested 15 million dollars in Cambridge analytic gun are suspected of also meddling around and mucking around with brexit as well through that company Steve Bannon who was the campaign chairman who was on the board of Cambridge analytic and then you had Michael Flynn and that stands out to me Michael Flynn who was the former national security adviser for 27 days was an advisor to Cambridge analytic we know he's also taking money from the Kremlin sitting at a table with Vladimir Putin I want to go to one more little bite about what Chris Wiley said and come to Curt by b√©la on this on what banning in particular wanted out of this relationship Steve wanted weapons for his culture war that's what he wanted and that's one that we we offered him a way to accomplish what he wanted to do which was which was changed the culture of America and Kurt Mardela having worked for Breitbart and worked with ban and changed the culture of America in what way and change it into what well I think Steve has talked often times about his goal of destroying deconstructing the administrative state in this country of tearing down the pillars whether it's Free Press whether it's the mainstream media establishment political parties that's what his goal has been from all along and he wants to use social media Facebook all these profiles and data to wage that war to target people to immediately manipulate them to advance the idea really a feeding them their brand of news what we would probably call fake news and infiltrate how they think and turn people into what what does he want people to believe he wants them to be soldiers and is in his army a disruption of being of a sailing against everything that is normal everything that is establishment he wants to use these people to amplify their extreme messages their extreme rhetoric I think the key thing that stands out here is the realization that this data these 50 million profiles and information that that Cambridge has has clearly been shared with Bannen with Brett Brett with the Trump campaign that these profiles are out there this datasets are out there we don't know how far they go who has control of them as as Brad gonna use them in this coming campaign because they haven't been destroyed yeah indeed and the other people that were they were giving access to the same data to Russian oil companies we now have from the New York Times that lukoil a Russian oil company was interested in how data could be used to target American voters here's the quote from Christopher Wiley we're sending them stuff about political targeting they come and asked more about political targeting and he says that he added that Luke well just didn't seem to be interested in how the techniques could be used commercially so now you have commercial Russian oil companies also wanting this data why in the world might they want that well clearly and as we know in Russia the the state is intertwined with basically all big business in that country so the idea that just an oil company would be interested in Cambridge analytic Oh to me that shows that the Russian state is interested in using these profiles against American yeah and we also have Natasha news that from The Daily Beast that WikiLeaks is also connected to Cambridge analytic in that nicks is that one of the leaders of cams analytical wrote in an email that he reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange about Hillary Clinton's missing 33,000 emails so now we have one connection right and I would just have that there's a lot that we still don't know about the Trump campaigns and data operation there is you know there are a number of people that were connected to the campaign who were paid via you know LLC's and shell companies to conduct social media work and we don't know still what the what the what the content of that social media work was and there is one name that stands out in particular it's John I Donna see he's a Michael Flynn kind of guy and he was brought on by the campaign and yeah now he's of interest to before the house until committee was essentially shut down he was put on the list of potential witnesses to kind of figure out who this guy is why he was what whether he or not he was connected to Cambridge analytic and why he was paid via a venture capital firm by the Trump campaign which is of course was was perhaps used to kind of shield you know the the content of his work so the social media aspect of the Trump campaigns work during during the election of course is really still shrouded in a lot of secrecy and they're gonna do it in yeah I mean that clearly Brad Parks Cal is is running the campaign there's a lot of talk that Jared Kushner is gonna have a soft landing from the White House and move over to being sort of a campaign chairman so you're getting the old crew back together getting the old crew back together and Cardella without Bannen yeah well banning is in political exile right up but he's also right now in France in Italy trying to build new alliances with the extreme wings of the political parties the going on there and even after the election Cameron analytical at Alexander Nicks went on this global tour to try to promote what they were doing how they did it in the u.s. how they did it with Trump and they're trying to sell it to other countries they did the same thing in India with the opposition party of Prime Minister Modi Wow manufacturing consent worldwide natasha bertrand Gabrus erm interpret dela thank you guys an up next more reaction to stormy Daniel than the McCabe firing
