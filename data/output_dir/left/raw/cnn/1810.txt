00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149
this morning we can show you this we
have to be careful because of the

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,390
Twitter handle of the individual who
sent it in the first place the President

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,500
of the United States the President of
the United States retweeting a video on

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,400
Twitter that shows him hitting a golf
ball and then the golf ball striking

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,439
Hillary Clinton and knocking her down
you see it there the president of the

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:26,849
United States retweeted that this
morning why what he said bad news bad

7
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,970
news
you know traditionally historically

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:36,360
speaking weekends at Bedminster even at
an important time like weekend when he's

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,149
going into the United Nations General
Assembly for the first time as the

10
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,050
president the United States are risky
times he's maybe he's by himself maybe

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,230
he's not surrounded by as many aides as
you as he usually is certainly not at

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,449
this hour of the morning I think you
know Curren right he's a disrupter you

13
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,190
know and he has these impulses he enjoys
engaging on social media you hear him

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,489
talk about that that that's so important
to his identity and people want to hear

15
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:06,330
from him but it is unusual coming off of
these this this last couple of weeks we

16
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:13,290
can't find the words because it's he's
the president United States it is insane

17
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:20,040
a very unusual coinage I used the word
again

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,299
he loves the headlines when he will deal
with Democrats when he's seen as getting

19
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,920
things done when he's seen as you know
delivering on promises but then he'll

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,439
come out on a Saturday morning and sort
of blow himself up with these these

21
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,750
crazy tweets that are not presidential
they don't forward any particular agenda

22
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,780
of his I mean this wasn't about
immigration it wasn't about any policy

23
00:01:42,780 --> 00:00:00,000
thing it's just something I probably
thought it was funny
