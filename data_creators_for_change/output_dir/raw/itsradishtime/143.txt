18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,430
about their life choices I'm definitely

19
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,489
guilty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I'm sorry to everyone</font>

20

had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be around me when I first</font>

discovered environmentalism when I was

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,250
19 but at the root of all of this is

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,729
that we're fragile all we

24
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:08,130
want us to be loved and accepted and to

25
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,630
feel like we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> making the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right choices</font>

26
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,479

32
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,680
