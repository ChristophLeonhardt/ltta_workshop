more than 17,000 members have left the Labour Party in the last three months over the ongoing anti-semitism row in the party and this pressure keeps getting piled on poor old Jeremy Corbyn I can't help but think that this is a welcome taste of Labour's own medicine we all knew that Jeremy Corbyn was dangerous I mean he's refused to condemn the IRA as well as the president of Venezuela and despite being Pro brags that his entire political life the guy's now suggesting that we stay in the customs union after Briggs it's who is a professional at Pisa and this along with his long-held anti-israel views has created an anti-semitism storm and the outrage and criticism are well deserved I mean Corbin's associated with leaders from Hamas and called them his mates he's refused to condemn the anti-semitic posters and banners that can be seen at every alkyds Day rally in London an event actually that was sponsored by the Stop the War Coalition which he only recently stepped down as chair from after winning Labour's leadership and an investigation by The Telegraph found that Corbin had had a ten year long association with the dear yes in remember group which has been exposed for its anti-semitic views and even denial of the Holocaust I mean this isn't a smear the claims of anti-semitism in the Labor Party are serious when Corbin only has himself to blame if he isn't an anti-semite and I doubt that then Corbin is a political mr. magoo constantly bindery finding himself in unfortunate political positions bumping into anti-semites on the way and doping comically when he hears his friends and colleagues deny the Holocaust Oh Jeremy and momentum the most radical left-wing and anti-israel section of the Labour Party has tried to publicly disassociate with the anti-semitism as well which is funny I mean they admit the problem saying the claim shouldn't be dismissed as right-wing smears because well they're not but absurdly they tried to suggest that the Labour Party isn't doing enough to stamp it out well if labour wanted to take this seriously then they stamped momentum out for a start they're the most anti-semitic out of the lot of them but is it ever gonna happen I mean no labor only tackles anti-semitism when they're forced to write the recent case of one of their council candidates being suspended after his anti-semitic post going back about ten years or so we're exposed we just believe that the Labour Party actually would have cared about this if nobody had brought it up no chance this is political appeasement the politicians and the media class you don't seem to understand the problem with Islam in this country are no doubt extremely confused by the labour party the party of diversity and immigration being so anti-semitic but the answer is simple most of them votes mean more to the labour party than Jews because there's more of them there are fewer than 300,000 Jews in Britain according to our census I mean it's a very small minority of people here and not only that over half of them live in London so this means that British Jews are not a powerful voting bloc labour carries London parliamentary seats easily so the remaining hundred or so thousand Jews are scattered across the UK having minimal impact on individual seats whereas the Muslim population is notably bigger and much more scattered according to the outdated 2011 census Muslims make up almost 5% the population of England and Wales with over two and a half million living here there's more in 2018 and with the high birth rates and continued mass emigration from the east some projections suggest that the Muslim population of the UK could triple to 13 million by 2050 that makes the Muslim population a hugely powerful voting bloc now in an even more powerful one for the future so of course the Labour Party wants to nurture that voting base and they do that by appealing to their anti-israel sentiment sure the party denies their anti-semitism now while they still need to count on the support of the white working-class they continue to dupe into thinking they represent but when the white working-class is our less important voting bloc and when Labour can count on Britain's multicultural and Islamic ghettos for their safe seats will they deny it then this is the Labour Party getting a taste of their own medicine with all these attacks and not only am I glad to see them being exposed for the hateful nasty lot they are but it's good to know they must be tossing and turning at night uncomfortable with all the media attacks against their Dear Leader the left are calling this a mistrial they think it's unfair that Corbin's being given such a hard time in the press they claim it's a right-wing conspiracy but it's not the motive simple Muslim votes matter more than Jewish votes and the Labour Party is filled with Jew hating anti-israel activists who would make the National Front blush Jeremy Corbyn you deserve the scrutiny you're getting and it's about time that you were exposed for your political appeasement of a large religious minority which has an anti Jewish and an anti English agenda watch me and the rest of the
