why do you want to spend six hours on the golf course that's why people don't come to the game I'm Rocco Mediate PGA Tour champion player what I'm seeing now there's a couple people have built 12 hole courses six holes on the front obviously and six holes in the back I can't add think about that for a second you know if you're working all day and you have two hours to go to a club but when you're done you can't play a team you know maybe the summer sometimes right maybe you don't want to spend five hours maybe you want to spend two you played twelve holes in two hours I guarantee it but some of the stuff coming up I've heard of a couple that are going to be successful because why do you want to spend six hours on the golf courses that's why people don't come to the game you have a family and a job you can't go spend six hours on Saturday and Sunday you don't see your family ever when you're working all day from 9:00 to 5:00 you want to go play nine holes go play six bags you get your practice in go home see the kids I think I think it's cool what they're trying to do and then they move the tees up a lot of places why don't we got to play 9,000 hour courses why does it got to be that far to go out and enjoy yourself just because the Torah plays 7800 yards that means you know to go out and enjoy yourself and go forward that's making it go faster that would be cool then more people would come play just because you're not playing 18 holes or 36 holes or a 72 laughter and doesn't mean it's not gone
