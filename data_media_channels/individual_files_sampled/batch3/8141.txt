DANA PERINO AND GREG GUTFELD. IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK CITY, AND THIS IS. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STANDING FIRM ON HIS DECISION TO PULL THE PLUG ON A WHITE HOUSE INVITATION FOR THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPION PHILADELPHIA EAGLES. THE PRESIDENT INSTEAD POSTING A CELEBRATION OF AMERICA EVENT. WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY. WE RESPECT OUR FLAG AND WE PARLAY STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE UNDERSTOOD. WE STAND TO HONOR OUR MILITARY AND TO HONOR OUR COUNTRY AND TO REMEMBER THE FALLEN HEROES WHO NEVER MADE IT BACK HOME. Kimberly: AFTER THE TEAM WAS DISINVITED, THE PHILADELPHIA MAYOR SLAMMED THE PRESIDENT IS "NOT A TRUE PATRIOT" AND LAUNCHED A NEW PERSONAL ATTACK. THE GUY IS A SCARY GUY. I DON'T HOPEFULLY BY THE TIME HE IS GONE, WE CAN RECOVER FROM THIS MESS. BUT THIS IS A BAD TIME IN OUR I'M FRIGHTENED ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE HAS HIS HANDS IN THE NUCLEAR CODES, THAT HE THREATENS TO ANNIHILATE NORTH KOREA. Kimberly: MEANWHILE. SHAKING MY HEAD. MEANWHILE, THE WHITE HOUSE IS ACCUSING THE EAGLES OF PLAYING POLITICS. THIS WASN'T A POLITICAL STUNT BY THE EAGLES FRANCHISE, THEN THEY WOULD NOT PLAN TO ATTEND THE EVENT AND HAVE BACKED OUT OF THE LAST MINUTE. IF IT WASN'T A POLITICAL STUNT, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ATTEMPTED TO RESCHEDULE THE VISIT WHEN THEY KNEW THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO BE OVERSEAS. IF THIS WASN'T A POLITICAL STUNT, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE WAITED UNTIL MONDAY. Kimberly: JESSE IS A DIE-HARD EAGLES FAN AND HE WAS THERE FOR ALL THE ACTION AT THE WHITE HOUSE. HEY, JESSE. HEY, KAMIL E. Kimberly: HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT THIS? I KNOW YOU ARE A HUGE EAGLES FAN. HUGE FAN. LET'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT. BOTH ARE WINNERS. THE EAGLES BEAT THE PATRIOTS AND TRUMP BEAT CRICKET HILLARY. WE HAVE THAT. NO ONE IS GOING TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM US. IT'S TOUGH FOR ME. EAGLES, TRUMP. I AM A PHILLY GUY. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SIDE WITH TRUMP. THE EAGLES TRIED A TRICK PLAY, TRUMP SNIFFED IT OUT AND SHOW DOWN. I DON'T LIKE THE GAMESMANSHIP WITH THE GUEST LIST. IT WAS LESS THAN TEN PEOPLE. IT WAS LIKE OWNER, ASSISTANT COACH AND MASCARA. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE MAYOR COMING IN. HE DOESN'T SPEAK FOR THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES. HE SOUNDS LIKE JOY BEHAR. THE GUY IS A JOKE. WHAT MESSAGE THIS COUNTRY IN? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS GUY IS TALKING TO. EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY TO BE THERE. THEY DIDN'T SEE THE EAGLES. THEY SAW ME. I WAS KIND OF THE CONSOLATION PRIZE. ALTHOUGH ONE PERSON THOUGHT I WAS TED MOSBY. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHO THAT IS. ANOTHER PERCENTILE I WAS TUCKER CARLSON. Kimberly: WOW. YOU ARE REALLY WINNING OVER THERE. BIG DAY, HUGE DAY FOR JESSE. THAT'S FINE. BRIAN, YOU WANT TO CHIME IN? Brian: JESSE, IF WE ARE UNDERSTAND THIS ABOUT THE EAGLES DIDN'T SHOW. THEY MADE IT CLEAR LATE LAST WEEK THEY WERE GOING TO SHOP. THEY TRIED TO TRUMP TRUMP. WHEN TRUMP PULLED THE RUG OUT FROM THEM FROM WITHIN THE ATTACKS CAME. WHO IS THE WINNER? I DON'T GET IT. Jesse: LIKE I SAID, THEY ARE BOTH WINNERS. THE EAGLES HAVE THE TROPHY. THAT'S NEVER GOING TO CHANGE. TRUMP DOES WHAT HE DOES. HE DID THE SINGAPORE DANCE WITH LITTLE ROCKET MAN CANCELING THE MEETING AND THEN BRINGING IT BACK ON. THE EAGLES DON'T LOOK AT HERE BUT PHILADELPHIA FANS, I DON'T REALLY THINK THEY ARE GOING TO CARE VERY MUCH. WE ARE STILL GOING TO CHEER FOR THE EAGLES. THE TRUMP PEOPLE IN PENNSYLVANIA ARE STILL GOING TO PULL THE LEVER FOR DONALD. Kimberly: HERE WE GO. SUPPORTED HER NEEDS NEWS AT NIGHT. Juan: I AM DEEPLY OFFENDED. NOBODY SAID HEY, AREN'T YOU JUAN WILLIAMS? Jesse: NO, JUAN. I DID NOT HAPPEN. Juan: YOU NOY PULLING YOUR LEG. LAST WEEK, THE NFL OWNERS SAID THEY WERE SETTING NEW RULES FOR THIS COMING SEASON TO REQUIRE THE PLAYER SITTING FOR THE ANTHEM WILL REMAIN IN THE LOCKER ROOM. THIS MORNING HE IS TWEETING OUT NO ESCAPE TO THE LOCKER ROOM. THE OWNERS AREN'T EVEN ESCAPING. TRUMP IS BULLYING THE PLAYERS AND THE OWNERS, AM I WRONG? Jesse: I THINK BULLYING IS A TOUGH TERM, JUAN. I THINK WE ALL NEED TO GROW UP AND STOP BEING SO SENSITIVE ABOUT BULLYING HERE. THESE ARE BILLIONAIRE OWNERS MAKING A FORTUNE. I THINK EVERYBODY IS A GROWN UP HERE. HE DIDN'T LIKE THIS KIND OF IN BETWEEN DEAL WHERE YOU GET TO STAY IN THE LOCKER ROOM FOR THE ANTHEM OR YOU'RE GOING TO COME OUT AND STAND. HE WANTS IT ALL IN. YOU'RE EITHER 100% FOR THE COUNTRY AND THE FLAG, OR WE ARE NOT GOING TO PLAY BALL. HE'S GOING TO FIGHT UNTIL HE IS SATISFIED THAT AND WE WILL SEE WHO BACKS DOWN. SEEMED LIKE THE OWNERS BACKED DOWN A LITTLE BIT. Kimberly: JESSE, ANY MORE HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE DAY? Jesse: I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS BECAUSE WHEN I WAS TRYING TO TALK TO THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE WAS LEAVING, I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO. I LOST MY DAD FOR A SECOND, WHO I BROUGHT. I CAUGHT BACK UP WITH HIM AND I SAID DAD, WHERE WERE YOU? HE GOES, I JUST DID AN INTERVIEW WITH ABC. AND I'M LIKE, WAS A LOCAL ABC? HE GOES I DON'T KNOW. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN NATIONAL. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MY DAD SAID ON CAMERA TO ABC. I THINK HE IS JEALOUS THAT MOM TEXTS HAVE TAKEN OFF. Kimberly: I THINK YOUR DAD SHOULD GET AN AGENT NEXT, RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW. I'M GLAD YOU GUYS FOUND EACH OTHER. BUDDY SYSTEM AND ALL. SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS FUN. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE NOW, PARTING IS SUCH SWEET SORROW, JESSE. GET BACK TO WINNING. Brian: HOW COME PEOPLE SAY PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED ANYWAY. HE HAS THE MASCOT, THE OWNER, WHO HATES HIM, DESPISES HIM, SINCE HE'S DESTROYING THE COUNTRY. ONE OTHER PLAYER PERHAPS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE'S GOING TO HAVE IT? HOW COULD HE POSSIBLY HAVE IT? HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO CANCEL IT. Juan: THAT'S NOT TRUE. HE HAD ISSUED AN INVITATION. THE POINT IS THAT THE PLAYERS DIDN'T WANT TO BE USED AS, LIKE, THEY WANTED TO HAVE A REAL I THINK THEY REQUESTED TIME WITH TRUMP. THEY WERE TOLD NO. Brian: THEY WERE NOT TOLD NO. THE REQUEST WAS WITH 85 REQUESTS FOR INVITATIONS AND PRESS CREDENTIALS. YOU KNOW THE PHOTO OP DESIGN THAT HAS BEEN DONE. Juan: THEY DON'T WANT A PHOTO UP. THIS IS SOMETHING ONE OF THE FORMER PLAYERS SAID. IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT THE STANDING. A LOT OF THESE GUYS DON'T LIKE DONALD TRUMP. Kimberly: DANA, LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW THIS PLAYED OUT. PEOPLE EXPECTING THIS FUN, HAPPY THING. AND YOU HAVE THE MAYOR WHO SOUNDED KIND OF CRAZY. Dana: CAN I SAY I THINK THE WHOLE THING, ALL OF IT IS A REAL SHAME. I DON'T LIKE CULTURE WAR STUFF. I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS SUCH GOOD NEWS TO TALK ABOUT. THEY LEAD THE WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY WHICH IS ROARING. THEN THEY HAVE ALL THE STUFF. CULTURAL STUFF WILL ALWAYS RISE TO THE TOP. IT WILL GET COVER THE MOST. I DO THINK IT'S A SHAME. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE THE DETAILS BECAUSE I THINK SOME OF THE FACTS, AS I UNDERSTAND THEM, ARE IN DISPUTE. IF THEY WANT TO HAVE A PERSONAL MEETING BEHIND-THE-SCENES? WE DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. YOU SAID THEY DIDN'T. Brian: THEY REQUESTED IT. I DON'T KNOW THEY WERE DENIED. Dana: I DON'T KNOW. I THINK IT'S A SHAME. IT'S POSSIBLE MAYBE ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO DO IS JUST TO STOP HAVING TEENS COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND FOCUS ON THE PEOPLES BUSINESS. Kimberly: GREG, WHERE DO YOU FALL? Greg: I DON'T GIVE A TOSS ABOUT THESE PLAYERS. I AM ALL HERE TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT. THE ECONOMY IS GOOD. LOW UNEMPLOYMENT. WHERE IS ISIS RIGHT NOW? NORTH KOREA IS AT THE TABLE. WE HAVE IRAN ON WATCH. WE HAVE SO MUCH GOOD NEWS. I REALLY DON'T CARE THAT THESE PLAYERS ARE UPSET OR OFFENDED. I DON'T CARE. THEY ARE MILLIONAIRES. THE OWNERS ARE BILLIONAIRES. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO, SEE TRUMP DO IS MAYBE DO A DRILLING INITIATIVE TO DEAL WITH THE GAS PRICES. THAT WOULD BE GOOD. THE MEDIA HAS CARRIED THE WATER ON THIS AND MADE IT A TERRIBLE STORY. THE CLAIMANT IS NOT DIRECTED AT THE ANTHEM COLLEGES GOING AGAINST OUR EYES. WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME. YOU CAN SAY IT'S ABOUT POLICE BRUTALITY BEAVER WE'RE WATCHING IT HAPPEN DURING THE ANTHEM. THE ANTHEM IS A POLITICAL ACT. STANDING FOR THE ANTHEM IS A POLITICAL ACT. SO IS THE FOURTH OF JULY, SO WAS THE FLAG. THAT IS GARBAGE. IT'S JUST A SYMBOL. SAYING IT IS A FREE-SPEECH ISSUE COMMITS ONLY FREE-SPEECH IF IT IS PERTAINING TO THE GOVERNMENT. THIS IS AN ACTUAL BUSINESS. YOU ARE NOT GETTING ARRESTED FOR SAYING SOMETHING. YOU ARE JUST BEING, YOU'RE BEING PENALIZED AS AN EMPLOYEE. THE WAY THE MEDIA HAS CURATED, AND HE SIGHED SPECIFICALLY IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE IN WHICH APRIL RYAN AND THE OTHER DUDE FROM NBC OR PEPPERING SANDERS WITH REDUNDANT, STUPID QUESTIONS LIKE AREN'T YOU AWARE THIS IS ABOUT BRUTALITY? AREN'T YOU AWARE THE MESSAGES CONVOLUTED? WHEN YOU SEE PLAYERS UP THERE, THEY ARE MAKING THERE'S KNEELING DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, THEY ARE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE. THEY ARE INJECTING POLITICS INTO A NONPOLITICAL EVENT. WE TALK ABOUT THIS EVERY YEAR. WE TALK ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO RUIN A THANKSGIVING DINNER IS TO TALK ABOUT POLITICS. SOMEHOW IT'S DIFFERENT AT A SPORTING EVENT? NO. YOU INJECT POLITICS AT AN APPROPRIATE VENUE. YOU PAY THE PRICE. WE ARE SO OVER THIS. MOVE ON. Juan: LET ME TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS. IT'S ABOUT CULTURE WARS, AS DANA SAID. IT'S PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT TEARS OF THE FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY WITH REGARD TO RACE. Greg: I AGREE. BUT YOU SEE EVERYTHING THROUGH THE PRISM OF RACE. Juan: I DO NOT. I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT MAJORITY OF THE COLOR OF THE PLAYERS, THE ONES KNEELING AND RAISING A FIST BECAUSE OF PROTESTING BRUTALITY. LET ME EXPLAIN. IN FACT, THE RULING OUT OF THE FLAG AND THE ANTHEM WITH THE PLAYERS ON THE SIDELINES IS A NEW REALITY. IT USED TO BE THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS IN THE LOCKER ROOM DURING THE PLAYING OF THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. NOW THEY ARE ON THE SIDELINES. IN RECENT YEARS, THERE'S BEEN AN EXPLOSION, BIG FLAGS, FLYOVERS. IN SO MANY CASES, IN FACT WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT THE NFL WAS CHARGING THE MILITARY. Greg: WE ARE VEERING OFF TO ANOTHER I WANT TO AGREE WITH YOU, JUAN. Juan: POLITICS AND SPORTS IS IMPORTANT IN AMERICA TODAY. Greg: I WANT TO AGREE ON THIS. THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT THIS SPECIFIC DEBATE DID NOTHING TO HELP THE DIALOGUE. INSTEAD HE CREATED TWO SEPARATE TEAMS. PRO ANTHEM AND ANTI-ANTHEM. WHEN YOUR EYES LOOK AT SOMETHING IT HAPPEN, VISUALS ARE THE MOST PERSUADABLE THING. PEOPLE SEE IT DID NOTHING FOR THE DIALOGUE. ALIENATED SPORTS FANS. IF YOU BELIEVE STANDING FOR THE ANTHEM OR THE FLAG IS A POLITICAL EVENT, THAT'S ON YOU FOR BEING POLITICAL. Juan: I STAND FOR THE ANTHEM MYSELF BUT I'M TELLING YOU THAT WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE IS A SITUATION WHERE DONALD TRUMP HAS FOUND A WAY TO STIR HIS BASE. HIS BASE IS SAYING THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FLAG. NOTHING TO DO WITH LOVE OF OUR TROOPS. Kimberly: YES, IT DOES. Juan: THE NFL PLAYERS ASSOCIATION SAID WE LOVE OUR TROOPS. WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY. WE LOVE OUR FLAG. Greg: WHY DID THEY HAVE TO DO THAT? THE MESSAGE IS CONVOLUTED. Brian: THEY DON'T LIKE LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY ARE STANDING UP, THEY SAY IT'S POLICE BRUTALITY. Juan: BAD COPS, NOT GOOD COMPS. Kimberly: THEY HAD TO PUT THAT STATEMENT OUT BECAUSE IT WAS PERCEIVED, DISRESPECTFUL. YES, IT IS. Juan: PUSHED BY DONALD TRUMP TO STIR UP VOTERS. Kimberly: HE WASN'T THE ONE TAKING A KNEE. Brian: HE WASN'T PRESENT WHEN IT STARTED. HE WASN'T PRESIDENT WHEN IT STARTED. HERE'S THE THING. THE PRESIDENT'S COMMITTEE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY COME HE CAN LAY OUT WHAT HE WANTS TO. HE HAS NOT TAKEN ON KIM. IF YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY, HE JUST WOULDN'T TWEET ABOUT THIS. HE WANTS THIS FIGHT. Juan: YES, HE DOES. Juan: HE WANTS TO TELL Juan: HE WANTS TO TELB Juan: HE WANTS TO TELA Juan: HE WANTS TO TELK Juan: HE WANTS TO TELP Juan: HE WANTS TO TELO Juan: HE WANTS TO TELL Juan: HE WANTS TO TELE Juan: HE WANTS TO TELT Juan: HE WANTS TO TELO SHUT UP. Kimberly: LOOK AT THE RECORD UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG BLACKS AND MINORITIES AND WOMEN RIGHT NOW. THAT IS SOMEBODY WHO REALLY WANTS TO TELL BLACK PEOPLE TO SHUT UP. Juan: ARGUMENTS LIKE THAT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FAX. OH, MY GOD. Kimberly: THIS IS RIDICULOUS. Brian: CHRIS LONG, WHAT COLOR IS HE? Juan: STEVE KERR, ALSO A WHITE GUY. THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE FLAG. HE'S USING THIS TO ATTACK A MINORITY GROUP. Kimberly: NO. HE'S USING THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK THE PRESIDENT TO TRY TO CALL HIM RACIST, TO SAY HE IS AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE WHEN THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT WHATSOEVER. Juan: THE NFL IS ONE OF THE MOST INCLUSIVE WORKPLACES IN AMERICA BUT NOW AS A RESULT OF TRUMP'S INTERFERENCE, IT HAS CORRODED THE RELATIONSHIP. Kimberly: THE WHOLE THING. I THINK THE NFL IS JUST FINE. TEAMS ARE STANDING BY THEIR PLAYERS. TO TRY TO TYPE THIS INTO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CALL HIM A RACIST AND THAT HE WANTS TO TELL BLACK PEOPLE TO SHUT UP IS JUST COMPLETELY OUT OF LINE. Brian: IF THE POLITICO STORY IS TRUE, IT LOOKS LIKE A SCRIPTED EVENT TO EMBARRASS THE PRESIDENT. GIVE ME 85 PASSIVE, 70 PASSES, THE MASCOT AND THE OWNER. IT'S A SCRIPTED ATTEMPT TO EMBARRASS THE WHITE HOUSE. Juan: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE PLAYERS SHOW UP AND TRUMPED STAN'S PARENTS IS THESE GUYS ARE SUPPORTING ME. PLEASE. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE USED. Kimberly: WHY DID THEY SAY 80 ARE GOING TO COME AND THEN MAY PULL IT'S LIKE A BAIT AND SWITCH. HE SHOWS UP AND THERE'S THE GOOFY MASCOT AND POOR JESSE AND HIS DAD. Greg: THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO
