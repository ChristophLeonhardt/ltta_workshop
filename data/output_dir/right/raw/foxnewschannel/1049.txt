1
00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:05,770
PROTECT SOURCES.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,272
>> Shannon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

3
00:00:08,272 --> 00:00:09,774
CONGRESSMAN JIM JORDAN SAID THE

4
00:00:09,774 --> 00:00:12,276
HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE MAY

5
00:00:12,276 --> 00:00:13,411
HOLD A HEARING ON THE

6
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:15,713
SURVEILLANCE OF ALI WATKINS.

7
00:00:15,713 --> 00:00:16,847
JOINING ME TO TALK ABOUT THAT IS

8
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:18,983
CHRIS STEWART FROM UTAH.

9
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:20,751
THE CONGRESSMAN ON THE HOUSE

10
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:21,352
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.

11
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:22,253
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US

12
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:22,586
TONIGHT.

13
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:23,387
>> GOOD EVENING.

14
00:00:23,387 --> 00:00:24,855
>> Shannon: I WANT TO GET A

15
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:25,823
LITTLE BIT OF YOUR REACTION TO

16
00:00:25,823 --> 00:00:27,291
WHAT HAS BEEN BREAKING WITH

17
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:32,363
THESE LEAKS.

18
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:35,499
YOU KNOW HOW CRITICAL IT IS WITH

19
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:38,936
THE INFORMATION GATHERING BODY

20
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:40,071
THAT INFORMATION IS SENSITIVE.

21
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:41,372
SOMETHING WE HEARD FROM THE FBI

22
00:00:41,372 --> 00:00:43,474
SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE WHO

23
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:45,176
CARRIED OUT THE CASE INVOLVING

24
00:00:45,176 --> 00:00:47,311
JAMES WOLFE SAID HIS ARREST

25
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:48,512
DEMONSTRATES THE CONDUCT WILL

26
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:51,215
NOT BE TOLERATE AND THOSE

27
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:55,686
ENGAGED IN IT WILL BE HELD

28
00:00:55,686 --> 00:00:56,254
ACCOUNTABLE.

29
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:58,055
HOW MUCH IS THIS SENDING A

30
00:00:58,055 --> 00:00:58,823
MESSAGE TO OTHERS?

31
00:00:58,823 --> 00:00:59,957
>> I HOPE IT DOES.

32
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:01,826
IT'S AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM.

33
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:04,295
WE HAVE ACCESS TO SOME OF THE

34
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:05,696
MOST HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMING

35
00:01:05,696 --> 00:01:06,364
IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

36
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:07,899
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I'VE

37
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:08,833
TALKED WITH PEOPLE ABOUT THE

38
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:09,467
PROBLEM OF THE LEAKS.

39
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:11,202
I THINK THERE'S TWO PROBLEMS

40
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:12,003
HERE.

41
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:13,304
ONE IS AS YOU'VE DISCUSSED WITH

42
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:14,438
SOME OF YOUR REPORTERS, THERE'S

43
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:16,674
AN ISSUE OF FREEDOM OF THE

44
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:17,175
PRESS.

45
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:18,176
I'LL LET OTHERS TALK ABOUT THAT.

46
00:01:18,176 --> 00:01:19,911
THE ONE THING I CAN TALK ABOUT

47
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:22,013
WITH CLARITY AND THAT'S MOST OF

48
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:24,249
THAT PROBLEM GOES AWAY IF PEOPLE

49
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:27,752
DON'T LEAK CLASSIFIED

50
00:01:27,752 --> 00:01:28,253
INFORMATION.

51
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:30,989
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AND

52
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:32,690
MORAL AND LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY

53
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,994
NOT TO LEAK THIS KIND OF

54
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:37,529
INFORMATION AND IT HAS

55
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:38,296
IMPLICATION FOR OUR SECURITY AND

56
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:39,998
A HOPE WE GO AFTER THESE GUYS

57
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:40,765
HARD.

58
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:42,901
I'VE SAID THAT A THOUSAND TIMES.

59
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:44,269
>> Shannon: THE PRESIDENT TALKED

60
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:45,537
ABOUT THE TOUGH INTERSECTION OF

61
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:48,673
FREEDOM OF THE PRESS WHICH HE

62
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:51,142
SAID HE SUPPORTS BUT PROSECUTING

63
00:01:51,142 --> 00:01:54,312
THOSE WHO DIVULGE AND LEAK

64
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:55,547
INFORMATION.

65
00:01:55,547 --> 00:01:56,715
ESPECIALLY IN THIS

66
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:58,683
ADMINISTRATION SEEMS LIKE A

67
00:01:58,683 --> 00:01:59,250
TOUGH PROBLEM.

68
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,318
ANOTHER TOUGH PROBLEM IS THE

69
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:01,853
ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION AND THE

70
00:02:01,853 --> 00:02:03,154
ALLEGATIONS OF CHILDREN BEING

71
00:02:03,154 --> 00:02:03,989
SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS

72
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:05,690
WHEN THEY COME ACROSS THE

73
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,025
BORDER.

74
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:12,264
THE CURRENT ICE DIRECTOR SAID

75
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:15,433
THIS ABOUT WHEN KIDS GET

76
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:16,601
SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS.

77
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:18,537
>> CHILDREN AND PARENTS GET

78
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:20,038
SEPARATED IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN A

79
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:23,475
PARENT IS CHARGED WITH A

80
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:24,276
CRIMINAL EFFECT.

81
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:27,646
IT'S SAD TO SEE A CHILD CRY WHEN

82
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:29,314
YOU TAKE A PARENT BUT BECAUSE

83
00:02:29,314 --> 00:02:31,116
IT'S SAD DOESN'T MEAN YOU IGNORE

84
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:31,683
THE LAW.

85
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:33,085
>> Shannon: HE SAID THE PARENTS

86
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:34,953
ARE THE ONES ENDANGERING THE

87
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:35,254
KIDS.

88
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:36,521
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

89
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:38,490
>> VERY QUICKLY ON THE PREVIOUS

90
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,992
SUBJECT, THE FACT YOU DON'T LIKE

91
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:42,461
THE PRESIDENT AND MAY NOT AGREE

92
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:43,796
WITH HIS POLITICS DOES NOT GIVE

93
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,330
YOU AUTHORITY TO LEAK CLASSIFIED

94
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,031
INFORMATION.

95
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:48,033
I WANT TO PUT OUT THAT THERE.

96
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:49,535
THE NEXT QUESTION ABOUT

97
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:51,403
IMMIGRATION.

98
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:51,870
PEOPLE.

99
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,938
IT'S DISTURBING I UNDERSTAND

100
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:54,473
THAT BUT THERE'S COMPLICATED

101
00:02:54,473 --> 00:02:55,474
FACTORS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT.

102
00:02:55,474 --> 00:02:58,444
ONE IS WHAT HE JUST SAID.

103
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,312
WE'VE DISCOVERED SOME PARENTS

104
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:01,580
HAVE A CRIMINAL HISTORY AND IN

105
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,317
SOME CASES THERE'S EVIDENCE OF

106
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:07,820
TRAFFICKING OR EXPLOITING THE

107
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,954
CHILDREN AND CURRENT COURT

108
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:12,758
ORDERS ONLY ALLOW YOU TO DETAIN

109
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:14,259
THE CHILD FOR NINE DAYS AT THAT

110
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:16,095
POINT YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM IN

111
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,763
FOSTER CARE OR A RELATIVE.

112
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:18,964
THAT FORCE THE SEPARATIONS.

113
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,199
THERE'S THINGS WE CAN DO.

114
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,868
ONE, WE NEED TO SPEND MORE MONEY

115
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:24,937
ON FAMILY DETENTION CENTERS

116
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:26,171
ALLOWING THAT OPTION AND THE

117
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,640
SECOND THING IS WE HAVE TO

118
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,675
ADDRESS THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS

119
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:31,076
OF THE CURRENT COURT ORDER THAT

120
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:32,244
FORCE THE SEPARATION AT NINE

121
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:33,579
DAYS AND TRY TO KEEP FAMILIES

122
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,547
TOGETHER BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN

123
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,417
THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ENTER THE

124
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:38,751
COUNTRY.

125
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,020
THE FACT YOU SHOW UP AT YOUR

126
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,956
BORDER WITH YOUR CHILDREN

127
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:45,591
DOESN'T GUARANTEE ACCESS TO THE

128
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:45,925
COUNTRY.

129
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,494
WE STILL NEED TO SECURE BORDERS.

130
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:51,097
I THINK WE CAN DO IT IN A WAY

131
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,599
THAT DOESN'T MAKE MANY OF US

132
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,600
UNCOMFORTABLE.

133
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,735
>> Shannon: IT'S GUT WRENCHING

134
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,870
AND LOTS OF EMOTION ON ALL SIDES

135
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,006
OF THE ISSUE AND GOES BACK TO

136
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,174
THE ISSUE OF THE BROKEN

137
00:04:01,174 --> 00:00:00,000
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM WHICH I KNOW
