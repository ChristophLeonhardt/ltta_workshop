every 28 days or so we find ourselves feeling a little bloated and cranky and homicidal and we realize it's that time of month when we visit our favorite website everyday feminism everyday feminism is the site where left wingers give each other the kind of advice that would really improve the world if the world were the planet Zargon where everything is different than it is here in reality this month on everyday feminism there's a post entitled nine phrases a lies can say when called out instead of getting defensive by Sam Finch allies is a leftist word meaning someone who pretends to sympathize with someone who pretends to be marginalized it might be a white who sympathizes with minorities in the hopes they won't mug him or a man who sympathizes with feminists in the hopes of having sex you can usually recognize that sort of a lie by the frustrated disappointed look on his face part of the fun of being an ally is that the people you sympathize with generally hate you they're always calling you out which means they accuse you of secretly harboring hostile or politically incorrect thoughts about them this is great because who wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone who's always criticizing you I know that's what I love more than anything I also dig chicks who put their cigarettes out on my thigh it's just kind of a thing with me in his post Sam Finch says quote and all these quotes are real being called out can be a gift as it calls on us to rise up and do better to tap into our empathy and do the serious and critical work of interrogating our own beliefs and biases now I know what you're thinking you're thinking you are a sad little man Sam Finch a sad sad little little man but let's read on Sam Finch has spent part of the brief and precious time he has on this earth compiling a list of things you can say when the minority or female you're sympathizing with calls you out one thing you can say when you're called out is quote Wow you're right I need to work on this this is a good response because it takes the minority or feminists by surprise giving you a chance to sneak out for a beer with some white guys leave you the hell alone another response you can make is I appreciate the work you put into criticizing me Sam Finch writes quote when marginalized people take the time to teach you something it's essential to recognize their labor I agree Sam Finch I myself usually say something like thanks for taking the time to complain about me while I was trying to be nice to you I wonder what it would look like if you use that time to do something useful like get a job or shut up finally according to Sam you can say I apologize I'm going to do better after which you might want to add please mistress put your cigarette out out on my thigh again it works for me trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right it's mailbag day and we're it's our last mailbag in the old Studios I'm you can't see this because we through the magic of the broadcasting we hide it all from you but I'm broadcasting basically from the ruins of our old studio everything is gone the people are you

way I will try and talk a little bit about Wonder Woman later in the show but you know we we never get a chance to really talk enough about culture on the show I always feel like the politics kind of eats up everything and it's a political site so I know people want to hear about politics first but I had a conversation with my friend Tyler Smith over at his podcast more than one lesson and if you just type Google more than one lesson you can find it we were talking about fences so you got to roll down a little bit to get to the show about fences and you can hear oh very very ears it was like an hour-long discussion about fathers and God and fences and all these things it was kind of interesting what else oh the mailbag in which all your problems will be solved comes after the break so if you're on Facebook and YouTube you will have to come over to the Daily wire.com and while you're there you will want to subscribe so you can be in next week's mailbag so we don't have to go in another week you know I got an email yesterday that said I haven't subscribed yet but here's my mailbag question and then it was like this real problem the guy had and I was like yeah it's gonna cost you lousy 8 bucks a month I'll solve that problem for you but it's gonna cost you lousy 8 bucks a month also if you subscribe for the year you get a free copy of say it so papa dad me and the 2005 White

David Shapiro his father great gift for Father's Day and how it occurred to me the Father's Day is on its way so that's a good thing to pick up now and you can even give your father the subscription that would be nice so this morning as I always do I do this so you don't after I read the New York Times a former newspaper and you know there was this bombing in Iran Isis bombed two places they bombed Parliament and the Ayatollah Khomeini's tomb and like 12 people were killed who do you think is at fault in the New York Times who do you think caused this terrorist attack take a guess go ahead yeah amazing that's amazing you must be psychic that is incredible who is that listen to this the attacks the first in Tehran in more than a decade came just after two weeks after mr. Trump with Saudi Arabia and its allies vowed to isolate Iran in the view of many in Iran the Islamic state also known as Isis or ISIL is inextricably linked to Saudi Arabia one hardline analyst with ties to Iran's supreme leader said Isis ideologically financially and logistically is fully supported and sponsored by Saudi Arabia they are one and the same so right after Trump goes to Saudi Arabia to isolate Iran Iran is bombed than Saudi Arabia and Isis says this guy who's a total you know Iranian hardliners aterrorist so that's the guy he's interviewed he's blaming that New York Times is blaming Trump for this bomb I mean you know the thing is one of the things we worried about all of us I think worried about with Trump when he was running is that it was wonderful that he was taking the media to task after eight years of this media just in the lap of Barack Obama I mean just completely covering up his scandals reporting on him with his dreamy look in his eyes little bubble hearts floating around it was a perfect time to destroy the mainstream media and there is no question that Trump has made them but clown themselves they have become so obviously what they are biased the hatred the hysteria all of that and like and the badly reported stories all of that but I gotta say like you know one of the things we worried about was the Trump would justify their hysteria by being as bad as they say he is now he hasn't done that but he is being kind of a knucklehead I mean there's a report I've stopped paying attention to reports of tension in the Oval Office they're all these reports about oh you know Steve Bannon has week and you know ranks previous is being fired that writes previous has been fired like 150 times I don't know why still showing up at work but all this stuff is being reported so I'm a little wary when a story comes out saying Trump is on the outs with someone but this one is about Jeff Sessions the Attorney General there's a report out from NBC originally the sessions threatened to quit because Trump is angry at him because sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation and scary spy sir that the spokesman was asked about this and here was was his response how would you describe the president's level of confidence the attorney general Jeff session I have not had a discussion with him about that last time you said that there was a development I'm answering a question which is I have not had that discussion with him I said I have not had a discussion with him on the question I don't if I haven't had a discussion with him about a subject I tend not to speak about it so the last time he said this was about James Comey you know it was like James Comey got the hook so everybody's now worried about Justin's I just want to say if Donald Trump fires Jeff Sessions or they or forces Jeff Sessions out his administration will die death by knucklehead I mean that would be and I'm not saying it's happening I can't you know at this point this story's just fly so fast and furious you cannot tell they're all anonymously source this one came from a source familiar with the situation whatever that means so you just can't tell whether it's true if and I hate even hate talking about if these things are true but because Spicer said that if that's true this administration will die death by knuckle head sessions is not only a terrific person and a really good representative he is on board with Donald Trump a hundred percent and this is the thing with Trump you know you he's he has looked the list of good conservative things that he has done is mounting okay people keep saying you know people who still hate Trump on the right keep saying well what has he really done well you know there's not just justice Gorsuch there's realigning our allies coming back to align ourselves with Israel there is the cutback of regulations especially the cutback of regulations that affect religious people forcing them to pay for abortions birth control all this important stuff that he's dialing back there is the O it goes on our little light now I've lost it for a minute some of the stuff they're always just the fact that he's but clown the press the fact that he's but clown the fresh press the fact that he's ended political correctness he has done many many good conservative things he could be a terrific conservative president but he could knuckle himself in the foot that he could knuckle himself knuckle head himself to death and I'm afraid he will do that if he parts with Jeff Sessions like he did with James Comey who is now coming to town and this is the big show the left is it is unbelievable the expectation see they're expecting James Comey who already said that he has never been pressured he's never got an untoward pressure and if he had been pressured if Donald Trump had tried to obstruct justice he would have been duty-bound legally bound to report it and duty-bound to resign and he didn't do that so if he says that he's going to indict himself so the left is over the moon and the right is saying nothing's gonna happen and and probably these things tend to explode but it doesn't matter Comey will say something we can be sure that the left will spin for three days into Trump you know obstructed justice you have to hear how I mean the thing is there's plenty of scandal on the left to go around are the only law we know that's been broken is the unmasking of Michael Flynn there have been subpoenas and out to old Obama people about unmasking we know that Obama was playing fast and loose with intelligence and there's reason to suspect he's he was doing it to get at Donald Trump we know he played with the IRS for political reasons so why wouldn't he play with intelligence for political reasons there's plenty of questions Comey could be asked that will be the headline after the anti-trump hysteria dies down so there's a lot for the right to be looking forward to but you have got to listen this is Chris Matthews I usually don't go to MSNBC for media stuff but it's so representative and so hilarious it's worth listening this is him anticipating the Comey hearing I'm thinking back to to the McCarthy hearings I'm thinking about John Dean testifying that really broke open the Watergate story because he had a photographic memory I think tell me may have that ability he is a great I think he has a Jimmy Stewart quality so the good guy quality and he's gonna stand there he's gonna stab you just sit there and look up to the hearing senators the big-shot senators and I think people are gonna give them all the time he needs this is scary for Trump when I pick up the newspaper for Friday morning the major newspapers of this country top of the fold I will see a big picture and it will not be Donald Trump for the first time in a long time it will be James Comey testifying it is gonna be a powerful moment the Trump won't like he's gonna be pushed out of the spotlight for this guy unless he pulls one of these weird jokers things out of the Batman comics and shows up on TV shows that night which I think he might do and try to bump him from the news I think Trump may try that I'd say 7 o'clock come on hardball mr. president we'd like to have you on because I think he's gonna try to find some way to displace this powerful witness and powerful testimony we're all gonna get this is Jimmy Stewart vs. the Joker in Chris Matthews mind Jimmy Stewart versus the Joker and he's worried he's anxious you know like you know how like when you're anticipating something good happens you get anxious that maybe it'll go wrong he's worried that Donald Trump will steal James commis thunder by being the president he's showing up but I love it it's the it's Jimmy Stewart versus the Joker in the minds of the mainstream media and I only played that because it's representative I mean they're having happy hours and all this stuff so joe scarborough who has also just lost his mind i mean he got married to his co-host and he just lost his mind and he is now under the impression that trump is paying attention to him and he can work in Trump's head he that he gets in Trump's head recently after Trump left the Paris deal he said oh well this proves Steve Bannon is president and you just know I mean you know he's trolling Trump hoping Trump will say what you said Ben and his president why by golly I'll fired Steve Ben and on the spot like you know Trump cares what Joe Scarborough said so now he has this Republican Steve Schmidt on Republican strategist Steve Schmidt and listen to them trying to intimidate this the commis gonna testify before the Senate Intel committee and he's trying to intimidate the Republican senators on the committee into being tough on on Trump I'm being tough on Trump asking Comey tough questions listen to this exchange and there are some young rising stories you have someone like Tom cotton combat veteran harvard-educated lawyer someone had in his early 40s who could have a real national profile is he going to get to the truth tomorrow is he going to be a show for the administration Marco Rubio another person with a long career ahead of him how is he going to handle this so I think we're looking for a generation now of younger Republican leaders are they gonna put the country first are we gonna get to the bottom of what happened or are we gonna see nonsense tomorrow right and of course those are the two people you named actually went to the White House and had dinner last night did Donald Trump again being a schmuck thinking that he can he can buy people's integrity by inviting them over the White House and wowing him I'm sorry that's how he thinks I know that firsthand he thinks if he invites you to the White House and gives you food that you are going to cut him a break cut him slack the president is a schmuck like and then and then Trump is hit for being uncouth this is what I like there's a guy reason Allah Islam is that his name on on CNN who keeps calling Trump of POS and then he apologized saying it's not like me and then you go back and see any number times it's exactly like him there and then they call it Trump uncouth so here is and the the whole point of this is to intimidate Marco Rubio and Tom cotton say are you gonna put your country first or not are you gonna you know ask call me you know because what they should really ask him is like how much unmasking did the Obama administration do and who'd they share the intelligence with they should be asking those questions as well so here's Eric Trump on Hannity and I love this he was asked about well you can listen did you wish you went to Washington so you could be dealing with every second of every day you know I've never seen hatred like this I mean to me they're not even people it's it's so so sad I mean morality is just gone morals that flowing out the window we deserve so much better than this is really and you know it's so sad you see the Democratic Party they're imploding there I'm floating they have no message you see the head of the DNC who is a total whack job there's no leadership there and so what do they do they become obstructionist because they have no message of their own they have no solid candidates of their own they lost the election that they should have won because they spent seven times the amount of money that my father spent they have no message so what do they try and do they try and obstruct a great man they try and obstruct his family they come after us viciously it's really horrible so our Democrats people we will answer that question but first we have to cut away from Facebook and YouTube you got to come over to the daily wire.com to hear the mailbag all answers
