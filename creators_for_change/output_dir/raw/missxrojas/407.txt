32
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,850
your eyes glued to the floor and we walk

33
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,199

British look down at the floor look down

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,490
the floor down the floor you don't want

41
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,930
to blood them even by like looking at

42
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,250
them while making anyone feel the

43
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,990
slightest uncomfortable think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's if us</font>

44
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,610
so I've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit the supermarket and</font>

45
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,259
stuff so I'm sure the mean lots of

46
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,850
people smile out there and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will let</font>

47
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,770
you guys know how it goes is horrible

48
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,680
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's galing it's very daily I</font>

49
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,439
feel like I'm gonna be blown over

50
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,049
absolute<font color="#CCCCCC"> tired I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been rereading it</font>

51
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,610
with the second by Christopher Marlowe

52
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">and also doing a bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff to do</font>

53
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,909
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like reading love like</font>

54
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,950
criticism about that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole time</font>

55
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,290
without fail every moment I stopped I

56
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,360
could just hear my head the song in them

57
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,490
in the second episode of<font color="#CCCCCC"> nightmare</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

58
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,149
anyone who knows what love is will

59
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,649
understand I feel like today's video has

60
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,149
more than any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> chart to the dish</font>

61
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,070
government of me throughout the<font color="#CCCCCC"> day the</font>

62
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,689
morning I'm so kind of sorted and on top

63
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:55,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I know exactly where</font>

64
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,780
things go now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of flew in</font>

65
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,490
from town where there's been gales and

66
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,439
like rain it's all just a bit too much

67
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">for me today or just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit too</font>

68
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,950
much I can't hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything very well</font>

69
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,450
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my cold wish I could tell you</font>

70
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,160
guys that yet again I did really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

71
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,169
the challenge I you know fulfill the

72
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:10,860
mission

73
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,080
early and everything not really the case

74
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,210
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did pretty well like in the</font>

75
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,800
first half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day but towards the</font>

76
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,900
afternoon as things got dark and things

77
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,060
a little bit more hectic it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

78
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,160
quite hard to keep making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you were</font>

79
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,170
consciously smiling everyone especially

80
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,880
I found in the supermarket and in the

81
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">High Street when there's so many people</font>

82
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're just kind of looking around would</font>

83
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this mad grin on your face almost</font>

84
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a while I lost any sort of awareness</font>

85
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,140
of what my face was doing in general I

86
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,459
can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have told you whether it</font>

87
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,959
was smiling<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not it was more kind of</font>

88
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably lost in thought something or</font>

89
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,160
another but yeah it's hard it's really

90
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,709
it takes a lot of them a lot of energy a

91
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,690
lot of stamina to keep smiling the whole

92
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,540
day which is quite a sad thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font>

93
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it just so i may seem to me like</font>

94
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,110
it's quite a sad thing that smiling

95
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,420
doesn't feel like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the easiest thing</font>

96
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,650
the world in anything that's just

97
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,630
because i watched a sad episode of how i

98
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">met your mother yesterday</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that's</font>

99
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,650
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're so used to not really</font>

100
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,330
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at everyone in the eye walking</font>

101
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,860
past one another kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of completely in</font>

102
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,570
that in world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I little thought that</font>

103
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,680
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really think about those</font>

104
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,450
moments properly of course over the

105
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,310
crossover parts but yeah I was it was

106
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,780
there it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this was</font>

107
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,670
the one that I really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> struggled</font>

108
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,470
with I've ever smelled it like

109
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,299
two-thirds of the people i saw today

110
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:23,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">they and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was smiling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at you now as</font>

111
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,470
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I would love to kind of collapse</font>

112
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,900
and just sleep for about three days and

113
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">not have a cold I have to get back to</font>

114
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,720
revision so whoo whoo whoo<font color="#E5E5E5"> University</font>

115
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,000
luckily however I do have a nice mug of

116
00:03:36,000 --> 00:00:00,000
tea so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>
