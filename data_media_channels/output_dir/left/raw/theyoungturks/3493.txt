00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,670
>> I DON'T THINK THE LONDON
EVENING STANDARD LISTENED TO

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,549
SOLANGE KNOWLES' ALBUM, A SEAT
AT THE TABLE, SPECIFICALLY THE

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:13,719
SONG DON'T TOUCH MY HAIR, BEFORE
THEY FEATURED HER ON THE COVER.

4
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,600
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PHOTO
OF THE COVER, IT LOOKS LIKE A

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,910
NORMAL COVER, WHAT COULD BE
MISSING?

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,840
SOLANGE LET THEM KNOW

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,150
WHAT WAS MISSING FROM THE COVER
SHOOT, LOOKS LIKE SHE DREW THE

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,529
CROWN THERE, AND WE HAVE THE
OTHER PHOTO FROM HER INSTAGRAM?

9
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:29,380
WE DO NOT COME ABOUT WHAT YOU
WILL SEE IS THERE IS A FULL

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:34,739
BRAID THAT WAS MAKING A CROWN OF
THE LAKES THAT SHE HAD DRAWN ON

11
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,660
THAT WAS CUT OUT FROM THE
EDITION OF THE LONDON EVENING

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,660
STANDARD, YOU CAN SEE THE FULL
IMAGE THAT WAS CUT OUT.

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,660
THIS IS

14
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,920
PARTICULARLY IN POOR TASTE GIVEN
WHAT THE STORY TALKS ABOUT --

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:53,320
>> 
HERE IS AN EXCERPT FROM THE

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
STORY --

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:16,110
>> 

18
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,050
THIS IS WHAT IS PARTICULARLY
INTERESTING, ONE OF THE WRITERS

19
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:27,670
OF THE STORY CAME OUT ON TWITTER
AND DISAVOWED THE STORY.

20
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:33,190
SHE SAID --

21
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,980
>> SOMETHING WENT AMISS HERE, WE
WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS BEFORE,

22
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,020
SIMONE, IT SEEMS THEY DID THIS
STORY AND JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHO

23
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,340
THEY WERE TALKING TO AND DIDN'T
REALLY DO RESEARCH INTO WHAT IS

24
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,460
IMPORTANT TO SOLANGE.

25
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,440
>>THEY DIDN'T LISTEN TO HER
ALBUM.

26
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,540
IF YOU LISTEN TO HER

27
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:57,240
ALBUM YOU WOULD KNOW YOU DON'T
TOUCH HER HAIR, AND FURTHERMORE

28
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,840
YOU DON'T TOUCH A BLACK WOMAN'S
HAIR.

29
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,490
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE STILL

30
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,460
HAVE TO ARGUE THIS, OR WHY THERE
IS CONFUSION OVER THIS.

31
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,620
I WILL

32
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,250
PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE, THIS IS A
MAGAZINE FROM THE U.K., MAYBE

33
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:15,950
CULTURALLY THEY DON'T QUITE
UNDERSTAND THE COMPLICATED

34
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,660
HISTORY INVOLVING BLACK WOMEN
AND HAIR.

35
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,960
>>I WOULD GO WITH YOU ON THAT IF
THEY DIDN'T FULLY HAVE ACCESS TO

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,090
LISTEN TO HER DAMN ALBUM, WHERE
SHE TALKS ABOUT THIS.

37
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,090
>>VALID.

38
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,780
>>IT'S SO FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT
IS JUST A CASE OF JOURNALISM

39
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,480
GONE WRONG, AND I DO WANT TO
SALUTE ANGELICA BASTIEN BECAUSE

40
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,620
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WENT ON BEHIND
THE SCENES BUT I BELIEVE HER

41
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,260
COMPLETELY THAT SHE'S UPSET AND
IT WAS A FIASCO AND SOMETHING

42
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,100
WENT AMISS AND I'M SURE THIS
WASN'T THE FINAL EDITION SHE

43
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,100
WANTED TO PRINT.

44
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,520
>>IT'S NOT UNUSUAL IN A LOT OF
PUBLICATIONS FOR THE HEADLINE

45
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,240
WRITER AND THE PICTURE EDITOR TO
BE DISCONNECTED FROM THE STORY.

46
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,030
SO THAT I GET, BUT TO BE THIS
COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED, AS

47
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,900
THOUGH YOU JUST DIDN'T REALLY
GET IT AT ALL?

48
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,900
IT'S HARD TO GIVE

49
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,140
THEM A PASS, I THINK THIS IS A
BAD ONE.

50
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:20,250
>>AND SOLANGE BROUGHT IN HER OWN
HAIR TEAM, SHE HAD A VISION FOR

51
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,690
THIS PIECE, THE CIRCLE
REPRESENTS THE CONSTELLATION OF

52
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,320
ORION, WHICH IS SOMETHING
APPARENTLY THAT MEANS A LOT TO

53
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,220
HER, SO SHE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT
INTO IT, WHICH SHE DOES WITH

54
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:39,250
EVERYTHING, SO WHY WOULD YOU
ALLOW HER -- YOU SEE HER

55
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,459
HAIRSTYLE AS YOU ARE SHOOTING
IT, WHY WOULD YOU ALLOW HER TO

56
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:46,140
DO IT AND THEN CUT IT OUT AND
NOT THINK SHE IS GOING TO SAY

57
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,190
SOMETHING?

58
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:59,060
>>ALSO, WHY WOULDN'T YOU BELIEVE
THAT THIS WAS AN INTENTIONAL

59
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,090
CHOICE?

60
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,860
THAT HERE IS TOO HIGH --
NOW, IT'S INTENTIONAL.

61
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:15,150
>>ALSO YOU ARE TAKING TREMENDOUS
LIBERTIES WITH SOMEONE'S LOOK.

62
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,529
I DON'T GET IT, I CAN'T GIVE
THEM A PASS.

63
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,659
>>YOU ARE NOT BETTER THAN
SOLANGE, EVENING STANDARD.

64
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,419
>>I LOVE HER RESPONSE ON
INSTAGRAM, SHE DIDN'T EVEN SPELL

65
00:04:24,419 --> 00:00:00,000
IT OUT, SHE'S LIKE #DTMH.
