>>> I SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT
THIS MORNING OF SOUTH KOREA.
HE GIVES US TREMENDOUS CREDIT.
AND REMEMBER, ITER WAS VERY
ROUGH THREE, FOUR MONTHS AGO.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP TOUTING HIS
INVOLVEMENT IN THE HISTORIC END
TO THE KOREAN WAR.
SO DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP DESERVE
CREDIT FOR THIS DIPLOMATIC
ACHIEVEMENT AND PERHAPS
EVENTUALLY THE NOBEL PEACE
PRIZE?
OUR NEXT GUEST THINKS SO.
JOINING US IS A NATIONAL
SECURITY EXPERT AND THE DIRECTOR
OF THE INTERNATIONAL STUDIES.
OUT THE GATES YOU MAKE THE CASE
THAT THIS IS WORTHY OF A NOBEL
PRIZE.
EXPLAIN WHY.
>> I DO, PETE.
I THINK ACTUALLY IT'S A SLUM
DUNK TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
THINK ABOUT IT LIKE THIS FOR A
SECOND.
WE GAVE, YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT
OBAMA THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR
BEING PRESIDENT OBAMA AND NOT
BEING GEORGE W. BUSH.
IF THAT'S THE CASE, YOU HAVE TO
GIVE THE NOBEL PRIZE TO DONALD
TRUMP.
CONSIDERING THE FACT HOW FAR
WE'VE THE COME WITH THE NORTH
KOREA CRISIS.
GO BACK TO JANUARY WHEN WE WER
TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, A
BLOODY NOSE OPTION WITH NORTH
KOREA.
WE WERE ACTUALLY STARING DOWN
THE PRECIPICE OF A NUCLEAR WAR.
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE
DIED IF THAT HAPPENED.
CONSIDERING HOW FAR WE'VE COME
AND WE'RE ON THE BRINK OF
SOMETHING HISTORICALLY
SOMETHING HISTORIC.LLY
>> CRITICS SHOULD SAY WHAT IF IT
ALL FALLS APART, WHAT IF IT GOES
SIDEWAYS, WHAT IF THE NUCLEAR
AMBITIONS RAMP UP, WHAT IF?
>> WE'RE STILL IN A GOOD
POSITION.
THE PRESIDENT'S MAXIMUM PRESSURE
CAMPAIGN IS THE OLD COLD WAR
PLAY BOOK OF CONTAINMENT.
THIS IS WHAT WE DID TO THE
SOVIET UNION FOR 50-PLUS YEARS
AND THIS IS HOW WE WERE ABLE TO
PUT THEM IN A NICE LITING BOX
AND THE SOVIET UNION COLLAPSE
PPED.
PD.
THE SAME THING CAN HAPPEN TO
NORTH KOREA.
THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF MONEY.
THAT MEANS WITHIN A COUPLE OF
MONTHS NORTH KOREA WILL ACTUALLY
BE BANKRUPT.
YOU CAN'T BUILD A LOT OF NUCLEAR
WEAPONS, OR ICBMs.
>> OTHERS SAY IT SHOULDN'T BE
JUST PRESIDENT TRUMP.
YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT PRESIDENT
MOON, CHINA AND XI SAYING HE'S
FINALLY PUTTING PRESSURE ON.
BUT ANY
BUT DNY
BUT DOY
BUT DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS
HAPPEN ABOUT FORCEFUL AMERICAN
LEADERSHIP.
>> ABOUT ABSOLUTELY NOT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID TO THE
PRESIDENT YOU NEED TO ATTACK
NORTH KOREA OR YOU NEED TO DO
WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA DID,
STRATEGIC APPEASEMENT AND LET
NORTH KOREA HAVE THE NUCLEAR
WEAPONS.
THE PRESIDENT TOOK THE HARDER
ROAD AND PUT THE MAXIMUM
PRESSURE CAMPAIGN ON THE NORTH
AND THAT GOT US TO THE TABLE.
HE PUT PRESSURE ON THE CHINESE
WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID WERE
IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT WORKED.
>> AT WHAT POINT DO WE LEARN OR
LEST
LESSON.
BEFORE RONALD RIGHT L THERE WAS
JIMMY CARTER AND BEFORE THIS
PRESIDENT THERE WAS PRESIDENT
OBAMA.
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO LEARN THAT
STRENGTH IS WHAT BRINGS PEOPLE
TO THE TABLE AND BRINGS DOWN
EVIL EMPIRES.
>> IT'S STRENGTH AND DIPLOMACY.
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WE PUT A LOT
OF PRESSURE ON THE NORTH KOREANS
BUT WE ALSO SAID THAT THERE IS A
SEAT AT THE TABLE FOR THEM IN
THE WORLD COMMUNITY IF THEY'RE
WILLING TO CHANGE THEIR
POLICIES.
THAT'S IMPORTANT.
NOBODY WANTS TO OSTRACIZE THEM
AND NOBODY WANTS A WAR WITH THE
NORTH KOREANS.
BUT IF THEY'RE WILLING TO GIVE
UP THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN A
VERIFIABLE WAY WHERE WE CAN
PROVE THAT THEY'VE DONE IT,
THERE ICE GREAT THINGS AHEAD FOR
THEM.
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.
>> THE 2009 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE
GIVEN TO PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS FOR
HIS EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS TO
STRENGTHEN INTERNATIONAL
DIPLOMACY.
