00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,240
[music]

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:04,740
[music]

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,240
[music]

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:05,740
[music]

5
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,240
Emirates flights a long way

6
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,240
ways away

7
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,240
and all I remember

8
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,240
is coming back from [inaudible]

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,740
Yeah but your like

10
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,240
"your pushing that off until September"

11
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:19,740
"your pushing that off until September"

12
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,240
"your pushing that off until September"

13
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,740
"your pushing that off until September"

14
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,240
Awwwww

15
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,740
Awwwww

16
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,240
Awwwww

17
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,020
[inaudible] we can still be friends

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,960
Travis, when's your birthday?

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,960
August 6

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,960
Leo

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,680
can you turn on the air just a tiny bit? thank you so much

22
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,820
I would guess 37

23
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,500
I'm just not allowed to say where I'm going

24
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,940
I'm so glad the bay bridge is what it is

25
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,440
It's beautiful

26
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,620
still much better than it used to be

27
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,120
Uh there it is, there it is

28
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,080
so we can just pull up to the side right here

29
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,340
Thank you

30
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,680
Thank you

31
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,220
Good to see you too

32
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,180
I don't know if you remember me but the uh new people the old people

33
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,520
2010

34
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,700
Uh so we are reducing the number of black cars few months

35
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,660
Yeah it's good

36
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,420
I saw the email it starts in May

37
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,000
It's all about the rating

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,540
But you're raising standards and dropping the prices

39
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,400
We're not dropping the price on black

40
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,840
We have to, we have competitors otherwise we'd be out of business

41
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,880
You have the business model in your hands you put the prices you want

42
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,280
But you choose to buy everyone a ride

43
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,040
We started high end

44
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,080
We didn't go low end because we wanted to

45
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,320
We went low end because we had to

46
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,620
Seems like a piece of cake because I beat them

47
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,760
But if I didn't do the things I did we'd be [inaudible]

48
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,620
We could go higher more expensive

49
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,120
Oh I did

50
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,760
So here's the thing

51
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,480
We could do Lux in San Francisco so I have guys working on Lux

52
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,780
Which will be 50-75% more expensive than Black

53
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,300
But people are not trusting you anymore

54
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,100
Do you think people will buy black cars anymore?

55
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,780
Unless we buy them through Europe otherwise nobody wants to buy a car

56
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,760
I lost $97,000 because of you

57
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,500
I'm bankrupt because of you

58
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,440
You keep changing every day

59
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,840
Hold on a second!

60
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,560
What have I changed about black?

61
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,620
You changed the whole business!

62
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,120
What? What?

63
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,280
You dropped the prices

64
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,920
On black?

65
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,640
Yes you did

66
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,280
Bullshit

67
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,840
We started with $20

68
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
How much is the mile now? 2.75?

69
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,600
You know what?

70
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,100
What?

71
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,800
Some people don't like to take responsibility for their own shit

72
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,240
They blame every single thing in their life on somebody else

73
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,140
Good luck!

74
00:06:02,140 --> 00:00:00,000
Good luck to you too
