THE EXPLANATIONS WERE

79
00:02:07,937 --> 00:02:08,937
RIDICULOUS.

WE'LL ELECT SOMEONE YOU DIDN'T

PEOPLE IN CHARGE COMPLETELY

95
00:02:33,964 --> 00:02:35,232
IGNORED THE LESSON.

96
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:36,400
REFUSED TO LEARN ANYTHING.

97
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,968

113
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:00,891
PROBLEM IS, THE MIDDLE CLASS AND

114
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:03,260
THE COUNTRY BECAME A MINORITY IN

115
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:03,560
2015.

116
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,261
NOBODY EVEN NOTICED.

117
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:05,429
IT WASN'T A NEWS STORY.

118
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:06,964
YET IT WAS THE CRITICAL SHIFT OF

119
00:03:06,964 --> 00:03:07,831
MY LIFETIME.

120
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:09,800
YOU CAN'T HAVE A DEMOCRACY IN A

121
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,101
COUNTRY THAT DOESN'T HAVE A

122
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:13,203

BEGINNING TO BUILD UP THE MIDDLE

129

00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:23,180
WHAT YOU SAW YESTERDAY IN THE

LONGER HAD A PLACE TO GO.

135
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:33,123
WE MIGHT PAY A LITTLE MORE FOR

136
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:34,591
AUTOMOBILES BUT HAVE A REASON TO

137
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:35,158
BUILD THINGS AGAIN.

138
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:36,693
>> ALL THAT MATTERS IS THE

139
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:37,961
AVERAGE PERSON IN THE COUNTRY

140
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:40,531
FEELS LIKE HE IS VESTED IN THE

PRONUNCIATION, OF COURSE.

145
00:03:48,405 --> 00:03:50,641
THE POINT HE OR SHE COULD, FEEL

146
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:52,176
LIKE MY LIFE IS GETTING BETTER,

147
00:03:52,176 --> 00:03:53,911
MY EFFORT IS PAYING OFF.

148
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:55,779
MY KIDS HAVE A SHOT AT A BETTER

149
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:56,880
LIFE THAN I DO.

150
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,749
THE AVERAGE 22-YEAR-OLD KNOWS HE

151
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:01,018
OR SHE WILL NOT MAKE WHAT HIS OR

152
00:04:01,018 --> 00:04:01,819
HER PARENTS MADE.

153
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:02,886
THAT IS A DISASTER.

154
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:04,254
YOU HAVE TO FIX THAT.

155
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:06,290
BRIAN: LIBERAL PARTY, THE

156
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,392
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS CHANGED.

157
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:09,527
YOU'RE NOT CRITICIZING

158
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:09,894
DEMOCRATS.

159
00:04:09,894 --> 00:04:10,961
WHAT YOU SEE NOW ON THE LEFT

160
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:12,263
REALLY CONCERNS YOU, BECAUSE

161
00:04:12,263 --> 00:04:13,664
DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING YOU SEE.

162
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:15,099
>> IT IS TERRIFYING.

163
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:17,267
I GREW UP AROUND LIBERALS AND

MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT

00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:35,886
IT IS TERRIFYING AND ORWELLIAN,

174
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:38,422
THREAT TO ALL OF US, LIBERAL AND

175
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:38,856
CONSERVATIVE.

176
00:04:38,856 --> 00:04:40,691
WE SHOULD HONESTLY SPEAK UP

177
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:42,226
EVERY TIME THEY CHALLENGE THE

178
00:04:42,226 --> 00:04:43,093
BASIC AMERICAN VALUES.

ONE GUY SAYS HE HAD ICE THROWN

189

IT IS OVER, MAN.

203
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:20,665
THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH SO MUCH

204
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:23,100
OF COVERAGE, NO SELF AWARENESS

205
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,068

00:05:59,337 --> 00:06:02,607
CAN'T LOOK IN THE MIRROR WITHOUT

00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:03,041
SELF-LOATHING?

229
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:03,908
STEVE: DO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO

230
00:06:03,908 --> 00:06:04,876
THAT QUESTION.

231
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:06,177
>> PEOPLE NEVER PAUSE TO ASK

232
00:06:06,177 --> 00:06:08,613
WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE?

233
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:10,148
BRIAN: THIS STORY MORE THAN ANY

234
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:11,249
OTHER, THEY'RE ACTUALLY TALKING

235
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:12,984
ABOUT A WOMAN WHO IS 50, TALKING

236
00:06:12,984 --> 00:06:14,419

IS 12th GRADE AND BOTH CAN'T

238
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:20,124
REINSTRUCT THE SCENES.

00:06:20,124 --> 00:06:22,227
THEY FRESHMAN YEAR IN YALE, MAIN

DIDN'T REMEMBER.

242
00:06:24,395 --> 00:06:25,797
I NEED ADWEEK TO REMEMBER

243
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:27,332
WHETHER IT WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH

244
00:06:27,332 --> 00:06:28,199
OR NOT.

245
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,067
STEVE: ASKING PEOPLE.

246
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:30,335
BRIAN: "NEW YORK TIMES" WALKED

247
00:06:30,335 --> 00:06:31,870
AWAY FROM THAT STORY BUT THAT

248
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,338
COULD SINK A SUPREME COURT

249
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:34,472
JUSTICE, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

250
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:36,007
>> DEMOCRATS DON'T CONTROL THE

251
00:06:36,007 --> 00:06:37,709
SENATE ACTUALLY LAST I CHECKED.

252
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:40,278
REPUBLICANS, IF I LEVY ONE

253
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:42,280
CRITICISM OF THEM, THEY'RE TOO

254
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,614
LITERAL.

255
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:43,314
THEY PLAY ALONG.

256
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:46,117
IT IS LUCY AND THE FOOTBALL.

257
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:48,120
DEMOCRATS ACTING IN UTTERLY BAD

258
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,420
FAITH.

259
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,521
EVERY PERSON WATCHING CAREFULLY

260
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:53,658
KNOW THAT.

261
00:06:53,658 --> 00:06:54,526
REPUBLICANS RESPONDING THIS IS

262
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:55,227
NOT SERIOUS.

263
00:06:55,227 --> 00:06:57,629
HE IS A SITTING FEDERAL JUDGE.

264
00:06:57,629 --> 00:06:59,197
ISSUED SCORES OF OPINIONS.

265
00:06:59,197 --> 00:06:59,598

00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:02,200
IF YOU DISAGREE WITH REASONING

OR CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS TELL

269
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:04,169
ME.

270
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:05,904
DON'T TELL ME ABOUT A SINGLE

271
00:07:05,904 --> 00:07:07,472
WORD ABOUT HIS COLLEGE DRINKING.

272
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:09,007
IT IS STUPID, IRRELEVANT, I'M

273
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:09,841
NOT PLAYING ALONG.

274
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:11,576
THAT IS WHAT REPUBLICAN SENATORS

275
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:13,044
OUGHT TO BE SAYING.

276
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:14,279
STEVE: REPUBLICAN SENATORS DO

277
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,680
NOT DO WHICH IS THE DEMOCRAT

278
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,416
SENATORS DO, STICK TOGETHER.

279
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,818
>> EXACTLILY.

280
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:21,253
STEVE: REPUBLICANS YOU HAVE

281
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:22,387
THREE OR FOUR --

282
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:23,388
>> THEY'RE NOT DOING, THIS IS

283
00:07:23,388 --> 00:07:24,790
WHAT MY BOOK IS ABOUT, THEY'RE

284
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,958
NOT PROTECTING THEIR OWN VOTERS.

285
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,360
DEMOCRATS WAKE UP WE'RE

286
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,628
REPRESENTING PEOPLE VOTED FOR US

287
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:31,063
BECAUSE THEY WANT SOMETHING

288
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:32,798
SPECIFIC, IN THEIR CASE POWER.

289
00:07:32,798 --> 00:07:33,966
REPUBLICANS ARE REPRESENTING

290
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:36,301
PEOPLE WHO ARE REVILED BY ALMOST

291
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:37,869
EVERYONE WHO ACTUALLY HAS POWER.

292
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:38,870
MIDDLE CLASS IS HATED.

293
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,441
THEY'RE NOT STANDINGS UP FOR AND

294
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:43,308
DEFENDING THEIR PEOPLE.

295
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:44,576
WHAT IS THAT?

296
00:07:44,576 --> 00:07:45,944
BY PEOPLE, BY THE WAY I'M

297
00:07:45,944 --> 00:07:49,715
TALKING ABOUT SOCIOECONOMIC

298
00:07:49,715 --> 00:07:52,384
CLASS NOT TALKING ABOUT ETHNIC

299
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:54,686
GROUP OR IDENTITY POLITICS

300
00:07:54,686 --> 00:07:55,020
GARBAGE.

301
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,854
I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE IN THE

302
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:56,922
CENTER OF OUR ECONOMY.

303
00:07:56,922 --> 00:07:58,090
THOSE PEOPLE ARE HATED BY

304
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,358
EVERYONE IN HOLLYWOOD AND

305
00:07:59,358 --> 00:07:59,691
FINANCE.

306
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:01,360
THE REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE THEIR

307
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,228
PROTECTORS AND THEY'RE NOT.

308
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:04,630
