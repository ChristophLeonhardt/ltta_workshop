BEING ATTACKED IN A TEXAS RESTAURANT FOR WEARING A MAGA HAT. NOW, MORE ATTACKS AGAINST THE RIGHT. PETE: A MAN IN FLORIDA CLAIMING HE WAS ASSAULTED BECAUSE THE DRIVER SAW A TRUMP FLAG IN HIS YARD AND ABBY: ALSO THIS: A NEW YORK MAN ARRESTED AFTER THREATENING TO KILL SUPPORTERS OF A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN, AS WELL AS PRESIDENT TRUMP. SO WHAT IS BEHIND ALL OF THIS? ED: HERE TO REACT, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR MIKE HUCKABEE. GOOD MORNING, SIR. ABBY: GOOD MORNING, ALL. PETE: AS I SEE THIS PLAY OUT, IT ALL STARTED WITH YOUR DAUGHTER TRYING TO GO TO A RESTAURANT HAVE DINNER. I SEE YOU SMILING BECAUSE AT THE TIME WE THOUGHT OH, THIS IS KIND OF SILLY. SIR, IT'S GOTTEN QUITE SERIOUS SINCE THEN. WELL, IT ACTUALLY STARTED WITH THE ELECTION. GOVERNMENT, THE ONE THING THAT IS REQUIRED FOR THAT GOVERNMENT TO SURVIVE IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION. AND WHAT WE HAVE HAD SINCE NOVEMBER OF 2016 IS THAT THE LOSING SIDE HAS NOT ACCEPTED THE RESULT. MOMENT THIS HAS HAPPENED, THEY TRIED TO NOT ONLY DELEGITIMIZE THE ELECTION ITSELF, BUT THEY TRIED TO COMMIT ACTS OF TERROR. AND I USE THAT WORD VERY BEHAVIOR, BY INTIMIDATION, BY THREATS OF VIOLENCE AND BY ACTUAL VIOLENCE AND BY BOYCOTTING THEM AND BY TAKING AWAY THEIR LIBERTY. THAT'S TERRORISM. WHAT WE ARE SEE SOMETHING A FORM OF TERRORISM ON THE LEFT UNPRECEDENTED IN AMERICAN HISTORY. IT'S FINE TO DISAGREE WITH ELECTION RESULTS. I SAY IT'S FINE. IT'S REALLY NOT. THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY DESTROY OUR COUNTRY. THIS DESTROYS OUR COUNTRY. PETE: GOVERNOR IS, THERE ANOTHER INGREDIENT TO IT TOO? YOU SAY DELEGITIMIZE. HOW ABOUT DEHUMANIZE? THIS IDEA OF WEARING A MAGA YOU ARE IMPUGNING THE SUPPORTERS. AT SOME POINT THAT GIVES YOU LICENSE TO CONFRONT IN ANY WAY. WELL, IT'S VERY MUCH A PART OF IT I MEAN, WHEN YOU HAVE ANCHORS LIKE JOE SCARBOROUGH SAYING THAT ANYONE WHO VOTED FOR AND/OR SUPPORTED THE PRESIDENT IS A RACIST. THAT IS A RIDICULOUS STATEMENT ON ITS FACE HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED FOR THAT. CERTAINLY SUSPENDED AND FORCED TO APOLOGIZE. WHEN YOU HAD THE PANELIST SAY THAT ANYONE WHO SUPPORTED, THIS IS DONNY DEUTSCH WHO SAID IF YOU GOING TO THAT LEVEL, THAT EXTREME OF ATTEMPTING TO AS YOU SAY AND I AGREE OUT OF CONTROL. ABBY: YEAH, GOVERNOR, THIS IS WHEN LEADERSHIP TRULY MATTERS, RIGHT? TO YOUR POINT, THAT'S WHEN YOU NEED THE FOLKS AT THE THIS. THIS GOES WELL BEYOND THE PALE. BUT WE ARE NOT SEEING THAT HAPPEN. WHAT IS THE ANSWER? HOW DO WE GET TO A BETTER INCREASINGLY WORSE AS THE MID TERMS HEAT UP AND THEN 2020, HOW MANY MORE MAGA HOW DO WE CALM THIS DOWN? ABBY, I WISH I HAD A SIMPLE ANSWER BUT A LOT OF IT STARTS WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTITUTION OF GOVERNMENT WE'LL EVER HAVE. THE HOME. MOTHERS AND FATHERS RAISING THEIR CHILDREN TO RESPECT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS AS HUMAN BEINGS TEAMING THEM TO HAVE SOME BASIC FUNDAMENTAL MANNER COURTESAYS MANNER COURTESIES. EXTENDS ALL THE WAY UP TO NOT ONLY OUR POLITICAL LEADERSHIP BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAYBE THE AMPLE FIRES OF PUBLIC OPINION IN THE MEDIA. REALLY CONCERNED THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE ZERO UNDERSTANDING OF AMERICAN HISTORY. THEY HAVE NO IDEA THAT WE JUST OBSERVED THE FOURTH OF JULY AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS ABOUT. HOW IT STARTED. WHAT ITS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES ARE AND HOW WE SAVE IT. ED: ALL RIGHT.
