1
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:53,940
THE 
DEPARTMENT 

2
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:17,770
OF 

3
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:55,049
JUSTICE 

4
00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:01,469
ISSUED
ITS OWN OPINIONS ON HIS OWN

5
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,950
STATEMENT, DEVON O'MALLEY A
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN

6
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,770
SAID THE BRIEF WAS CONSISTENT
WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S

7
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,119
A LONG-STANDING POSITION IN THE
HOLDINGS OF 10 DIFFERENT

8
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,900
COURT OF APPEALS MISTER O'MALLEY
ADDING THAT THE FILING

9
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,840
REAFFIRMS THE DEPARTMENT'S
FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF THAT THE

10
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,070
CANNOT EXPEND A LOT BEYOND
WHAT CONGRESS HAS PROVIDED.

11
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,790
HERE IS WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO
BE TALKING ABOUT.

12
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,940
TITLE VII IS A PRETTY BROAD
REACHING RED STATUE THAT DOESN'T

13
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,579
NECESSARILY OUTLINE EVER TO HAVE
A PROTECTION THAT IT AFFORDS,

14
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:31,010
SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS UNDER
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS

15
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,579
INTERPRETIVE IN ONE WAY ANOTHER
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THAT DURING

16
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:37,230
THEIR WEIGHT AROUND SAYING WE
INTERPRETED TOTALLY DIFFERENTLY,

17
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,520
BUT THERE IS AN ACTUALLY FEDERAL
PRECEDENT THAT IS BINDING HERE.

18
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,269
SCOTUS HASN'T SPOKE OUT ON THIS.

19
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:45,770
WITH THAT SAID, I WANT TO KNOW
POLITICAL PARTIES ASIDE,

20
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,500
WHOSE INTERPRETATION IS CORRECT.

21
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,320
PREPARE TO BE A LITTLE SURPRISED
AT LEAST AND DISAPPOINTED IN ME.

22
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,850
I AGREE WITH THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION.

23
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:01,120
I AM FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE
JUDICIALLY.

24
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,230
DON'T GET ME WRONG, I DON'T
AGREE WITH THE POLICIES AT ALL.

25
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,639
THE IDEA THAT YOU SHOULD BE
ALLOWED TO DISCRIMINATE

26
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,140
AGAINST LGBT COMMUNITY IS
LOATHSOME, RIDICULOUS,

27
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,769
POSTURES, AND UN-AMERICAN.

28
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:18,680
BUT TITLE VII SAYS THAT YOU
CANNOT STAMINA BASED ON

29
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,850
RACE, COLOR, RELIGION, SEX, OR
NATIONAL ORIGIN.

30
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,440
IT DOES IS A SEXUAL IDENTITY,
AND IT SHOULD.

31
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,870
THEY SHOULD PASS A LAW
IMMEDIATELY SAYING THAT,

32
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,019
BUT THEY HAVEN'T.

33
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,139
AND AS THE CONSERVATIVE LAWYERS
POINT OUT HERE, OVER AND

34
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:42,430
OVER AGAIN CONGRESS HAS HAD
EVERY OPPORTUNITY IN THE

35
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,200
WORLD TO PASS A LOT AND HAS
CHOSEN NOT TO.

36
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,600
THIS IS WHERE AGAIN WHAT IT
MEANS TO BE CONSERVATIVE

37
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,220
JUDICIALLY IS NOT POLITICALLY
CONSERVATIVE, BUT TO SAY

38
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,209
WE'RE GOING TO INTERPRET WHAT IS
IN THE LAW.

39
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:02,540
OFTENTIMES, I THINK SO-CALLED
CONSERVATIVE JURORS WILL TWIST

40
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,350
THE LAW TO GET TO THEIR OWN
OPINION, BUT IF YOU DON'T DO

41
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,900
THAT, YOU JUST LOOK AT THE TEXT
OF THIS BILL, IT DOESN'T SAY

42
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,730
SEXUAL IDENTITY SO I ACTUALLY
THINK THEY ARE RIGHT ABOUT THIS.

43
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,190
AGAIN, ONE LESS THING ABOUT WHAT
I DISAGREE WITH THEM ABOUT.

44
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,488
CHUM CLAIMED THAT HE WAS GOING
TO BE A BIGGER FRONT OF THE

45
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:24,610
LB GT COMMUNITY THAN HILLARY
CLINTON OR ANYONE ELSE AND

46
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,610
IT WAS GOING TO MAKE YOUR HEAD
SPIN.

47
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,320
NO, I TOLD YOU HE WAS FULL OF
CRAP.

48
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,580
OF COURSE HE IS.

49
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,230
HE WAS NEVER GOING TO BE A
FRIEND TO THE LGBT COMMUNITY.

50
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,980
IF HE WAS, EVEN IF HE DID THIS
ON PRINCIPLE, LAUGH ALONG

51
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,990
WITH ME, HE WOULD THEN PROPOSE
HEY, HE WOULD GET HIS FRIENDS IN

52
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,490
THE SENATE TO PROPOSE A BUILD UP
A SEXUAL IDENTITY IN THE BILL.

53
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,550
HE ALWAYS INTENDED TO
DISCRIMINATE.

54
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,000
FIRST OF ALL, IF I EVER GO
SKYDIVING, I ONLY WANT TO

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,520
GO SKYDIVING WITH A GAY MAN, SO
WET THAT JUST BE CLEAR.

56
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,730
REST IN PEACE, SIR.

57
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,850
BUT I
WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHEN IT COMES

58
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,010
TO THIS, BECAUSE YOU GUYS BOTH
SAID THE SAME THING TO ME THAT

59
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:10,810
YOU TOLD ME BEFORE THE SHOW,
EVERYTHING THAT OBAMA DID, THIS

60
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,360
ADMINISTRATION IS SO FOCUSED ON
DOING, UNDOING WHAT OBAMA

61
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,300
DID THAT THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE PEOPLE.

62
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,650
I GUESS TO PROVE TO THE PEOPLE
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO

63
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,620
KEEP THEIR WORD, THAT THEY ARE
GOING TO UPHOLD AND PUT AN

64
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,520
END, ENDORSED THEIR BIGOTRY.

65
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,940
IT IS JUST A FRUSTRATING.

66
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,690
IT IS
LIKE I SAID BEFORE, THERE

67
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,240
ARE APPLES IN THE WHITE HOUSE
THAT WAS THERE WHEN OBAMA

68
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,550
WAS PRESIDENT THROW THEM ALL OUT
AND HAVE ONLY ORANGES.

69
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,320
IT'S LIKE CONSTANTLY LET'S GET
RID OF THAT NAME.

70
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,430
EVEN PEOPLE AT RISK OF LOSING
THEIR HEALTH CARE BECAUSE

71
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,980
THE NAME IS ATTACHED, BUT IT'S
OBVIOUS AND ANNOYING.

72
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,400
BUT WHAT I THINK ABOUT THESE
CONSERVATIVES THAT ARE

73
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,120
ALWAYS CLAIMING TO UPHOLD
MORALITY, THEIR MORALITY IS

74
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,820
ALWAYS AT THE EXPENSE OF
SOMEBODY ELSE'S HUMANITY

75
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,220
AND THAT IS WHAT IS SO
FRUSTRATING THAT WE TO THIS

76
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,970
DAY, THE SHIRT THAT I SAW AT THE
MARCH, THIS OLDER WHITE WOMAN.

77
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,180
SHE WAS MAYBE 70.

78
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,510
SHE WAS LIKE I CAN'T BELIEVE I
STILL HAVE TO MARCH FOR THE SHIT.

79
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,200
THAT WE ARE STILL HAVING DEBATES
ABOUT THE PEOPLE BEING ABLE

80
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,970
TO HAVE RIGHTS AND NOT BEING
HARASSED AND DISCRIMINATED

81
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,320
AGAINST THAT WORKED OUT

82
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,770
CAN I BUILD UP THAT WILL
QUICKENING GRACE, I'M SUPER

83
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,090
CURIOUS LIKE YOUR OPINION ON
THIS.

84
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,780
DEMOCRATS, WHY DON'T YOU
PROPOSE A BILL THAT PUTS SEXUAL

85
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,050
IDENTITY AND TITLE VII AND
PUT THE REPUBLICANS ON THE

86
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,760
SPOT, BECAUSE HISTORY IS ON YOUR
SIDE.

87
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,540
BEST OF ALL, THE PRESENT IS ON
YOUR SIDE.

88
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,940
NOW A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF
AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT LGBT

89
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,370
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY HUMANS.

90
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,370
WHAT?

91
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,370
I KNOW, RIGHT?

92
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,810
AND SHOULD HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS
AS EVERYBODY ELSE.

93
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,180
YOU WOULD WIN TODAY AND THEN
LATER, WHEN THAT NUMBER

94
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,010
MOVES TO WHATEVER IT IS TODAY,

95
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,820
57 WHATEVER IT IS TONIGHT 77 AND
97, YOU'LL HAVE THEM ON THE

96
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,520
RECORD AS THE PEOPLE WHO NEVER
BELIEVED IN THE QUALITY AND

97
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,690
YOU NEVER BELIEVED IN AMERICA IN
THE FIRST PLACE.

98
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,770
CENK UYGUR, THAT IS EXACTLY
WHERE I STAND ON THIS.

99
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,889
I THINK THAT I WANT TO SEE
ACTION FROM PEOPLE WHO

100
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:15,530
ASSERT THAT THEY ARE ALLIES
FOR THE LGBT COMMUNITY TO

101
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,970
PROPOSE SOMETHING SO WOULD HAVE
TO DEAL WITH THIS SORT OF LEGAL

102
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,840
LOOPHOLE WHICH AGAIN, I HAD TO
WRITE MY THOUGHTS DOWN BECAUSE

103
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,340
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE I AM
VERY CLOSE TO, AND IS NOTING

104
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,080
DIRECT THE DOJ IS NOT DEAD WRONG
IN THEIR INTERPRETATION BECAUSE

105
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,000
THEY ARE NOT ARGUING AGAINST
BINDING PRIOR COURT DECISIONS.

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,770
WHAT IS GOING TO COME DOWN TO
THE PROCLIVITIES OF THE

107
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,400
SECOND CIRCUIT WHICH FORTUNATELY
IS A FAIRLY LIBERAL CIRCUIT

108
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,840
WITHOUT A TRUMP APPOINTEE BUT
RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST KIND

109
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,500
OF CROSSING OUR FINGERS THAT
THEY WILL HAVE A LIBERAL

110
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,230
AND PROGRESSIVE INTERPRETATION
OF TITLE 7.

111
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,340
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO HOPE FOR
THAT ANYMORE IN 2017.

112
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,410
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE
INTRODUCTION OF A BILL THAT

113
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,730
PEOPLE CAN VOTE ON SO THAT
PEOPLE WILL GO ON THE

114
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,360
RECORD, ARE YOU AN ALLEY OR NOT?

115
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,230
IT WOULD BE SUCH AS CLEAR-CUT
ISSUE.

116
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,600
YOU BELIEVE I SHOULD BE FIRED
FOR BEING GAY?

117
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,336
I REALLY THINK THAT THAT IS
WHERE WE ARE AT BECAUSE IT

118
00:08:02,336 --> 00:08:05,470
IS DISHEARTENING TO LOOK AT
THIS AND THINK WELL, YEAH,

119
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,830
ACTUALLY UNFORTUNATELY THERE
ISN'T A BINDING FEDERAL

120
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,420
PRECEDENT HERE AND THERE IS
NO MENTION OF SEXUAL

121
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,919
ORIENTATION IN TITLE VII SO
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

122
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:17,180
WAS LENIENT ON THEIR
INTERPRETATION AND

123
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,889
2014 2015 SAW SOME
ADMINISTRATION MEMOS AND

124
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:23,730
ISSUES THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT
TITLE VII IS TO PROTECT ON

125
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,930
THE BASIS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION
BUT NOTHING IN WRITING.

126
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,090
LET'S GET SOMETHING IN WRITING
AND TAKE ACTION.

127
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,100
I'M NOT SATISFIED WITH JUST
TRUSTING AND ADMINISTRATION

128
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,039
OF HER BEST INTEREST AT HEART
BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT

129
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,419
WHAT THEY'RE DOING UNDER GENERAL
SESSIONS.

130
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,659
THEY DON'T CARE.

131
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,519
IN
FACT, THEY ARE ACTING

132
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,860
SPECIFICALLY, ALTHOUGH THEY DID
ISSUE THIS AMICUS BRIEF,

133
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,410
THEY DIDN'T NEED TO.

134
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,550
THIS DIDN'T CONCERN THEM REALLY.

135
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,290
THIS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL
FILING.

136
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,589
THEY JUST WANTED TO THROW THEIR
WEIGHT AROUND JUST TO SAY,

137
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:54,460
JUST YOU KNOW, WE'RE THE NEW
SHERIFF IN TOWN RIGHT NOW

138
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,790
SO DON'T GET TOO COMFORTABLE.

139
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,350
BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE
IS THAT THEY TRY FEAR

140
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,770
LAMBDA LEGAL WILL COME OUT ISSUE
ANOTHER THIRD-PARTY OPINION

141
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,100
AND THAT WILL BE TAKEN INTO
CONSIDERATION BEFORE THERE

142
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,420
IS A CORE ANALYSIS.

143
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,529
GAYS FOR TRUMP, IF YOU LOOK AT
THE HASHTAG THERE ARE SO

144
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:12,280
MANY GAY PEOPLE WHO ARE FOR TRUMP.

145
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,740
I LAUGH AT THEM LIKE I LAUGH AT
THE LATINAS FOR TRUMP, BUT

146
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:24,080
THERE ARE SO MANY GAY PEOPLE,
AND THE PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW BELOW,

147
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,550
THE DEVIL GUY, THERE'S SO MANY
PEOPLE WHO ARE BEHIND THIS

148
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,190
AND THIS IS WITH EVERY GROUP
THAT WAS SUPPORTING TRUMP.

149
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,110
IT IS YOUR TURN THIS TIME.

150
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,110
I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU.

151
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,840
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE I GET

152
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,140
HARASSED BY GAYS FOR TRUMP ON
TWITTER.

153
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,890
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK,
BECAUSE I SPEAK OUT AGAINST TRUMP

154
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,450
AND THEYíRE LIKE, HEíS PROGRESSIVE.

155
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,220
BUT THEY ARE LIKE WE DONíT WANT

156
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,210
TO BE ATTACHED TO PEOPLE THAT
NEED AND DON'T WANT TO PULL

157
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,800
THEMSELVES UP BY THE BOOTSTRAPS.

158
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,060
THAT APPLIES TO EVERY GROUP.

159
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,140
THERE ARE A LOT OF GAY ELITISTS
OUT THERE WHO VOTED FOR

160
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,760
TRUMP AND NOW HERE IT IS.

161
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,980
YOU CAN BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST
AND HARASSED AT YOUR JOB

162
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,250
AND IT IS NOT AGAINST THE LAW.

163
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,160
NOW WHAT I WANT TO HEAR FROM
YOU.

164
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,770
YOU WANT TO TWEET AT ME,
TWEET ME ABOUT THAT.

165
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,860
LAST COUPLE OF THINGS ON
THIS.

166
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,190
ONE IS, I KNOW THAT IT IS OPEN
TO INTERPRETATION, BUT I

167
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,980
THINK YOU ARE REALLY STRETCHING
INTERPRETIVELY TO SAY THAT

168
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,990
SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS IN THERE
WHEN IT IS NOT.

169
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,230
I KNOW YOU CAN MAKE AN ARGUMENT
ABOUT HEY, THESE ARE

170
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,050
GENERALLY PROTECTING RIGHTS.

171
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,660
I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT.

172
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,080
GOTTA BE HONEST, I DON'T AGREE
WITH IT, THAT IS WHY ONE OF

173
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,800
BILL AND NOT JUST IN
INTERPRETATION, BUT DON'T

174
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,270
THINK THEY'RE ACTING ON A
PRINCIPAL.

175
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,800
HE DID THIS ON THE DAY THAT HE
WAS GETTING TREMENDOUS HEAT

176
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,899
FOR THE RUSSIAN CONNECTIONS AND
FIRING OF MOELLER.

177
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:50,600
HE DID THE TRAINS BEEN IN THE
MILITARY AND THE SAME DAY.

178
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,740
IT IS REDMEAT FOR HIS BASE.

179
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,360
IT IS A VERY MINOR ISSUE IN
TERMS OF THE LEGAL PRECEDENT

180
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
THAT IS BEING SET.

181
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,130
IT IS
IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF CIVIL

182
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:05,410
RIGHTS, BUT THEY DIDN'T DO OUT
OF PRINCIPLE RANDOMLY ON THIS

183
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,410
DAY.

184
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,730
ITíS THE REASON
THE GAYS FOR TRUMP AND ALL

185
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,380
THOSE GUYS SAY THEY ARE PAPER,
THEY WILL SAY THEY ARE IN

186
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,380
FAVOR OF THIS.

187
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,360
ALL THEY WANT IS ATTENTION.

188
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,720
HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT
PROTECTING HIS BASE.

189
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,250
YOU CARE ABOUT ANYBODY BUT
HIMSELF.

190
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,910
HERE, THIS IS ANOTHER
OPPORTUNITY TO SELF

191
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,390
AGGRANDIZE AND I WILL GET EVEN
MORE ATTENTION FOR SAYING

192
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,950
I'M AGAINST GAYS WHEN I AM
GAY.

193
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:32,380
YES, MY CAREER AT THE EXPENSE OF
EVERYONE ELSE AND FINALLY,

194
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,360
EXACTLY RIGHT, ALL OF THE
SUPPORTERS INCLUDING PETER

195
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,790
THIEL WHO IS A VERY WEALTHY
SILICON VALLEY INVESTOR WHO

196
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,740
DID THAT SPEECH AT THE
CONVENTION FOR DONALD TRUMP.

197
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,740
HE HAPPENS TO BE GAY.

198
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,020
HE IS LIKE
TRUMP WILL BE FINE, I WANT MY

199
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,090
TAX CUTS.

200
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,420
WHAT NOW?

201
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,490
YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT THAT.

202
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,920
MAYBE YOU THINK I DON'T CARE, I
WILL THROW THE REST OF MY

203
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,070
COMMUNITY UNDER THE BUS BECAUSE
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AN

204
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,261
EXTRA BUCK BUT AT LEAST BE
HONEST ABOUT IT BECAUSE

205
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:04,779
THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

206
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:08,940
BOOTSTRAPS, WELL, IF YOU WORK
SUPER HARD AND YOU GOT A GREAT

207
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,460
JOB AND YOU PULLED YOURSELF UP
BY THE BOOTSTRAPS, NOW THEY

208
00:12:12,460 --> 00:00:00,000
CAN JUST FIRE YOU FOR BEING GAY,
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DID.
