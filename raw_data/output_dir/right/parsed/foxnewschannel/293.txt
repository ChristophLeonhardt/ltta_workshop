ARE PEOPLE READY WHERE YOU?
>> THEY WERE READY BUT THEY
TOOK A RELAXED APPROACH TO THE
STORM.
EVEN WHAT WE HEARD FROM
EMERGENCY SERVICES.
A LOT OF OPTIMISM THE WORST OF
THE STORM WILL HIT FURTHER EAST
ON THE PANHANDLE.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE
AT THE CHICO MARINA WHO DECIDED
TO RIDE OUT THE STORM IN BOATS.
THEY'LL STAY ON THE BOATS AND
THEY LIVE IN THEIR BOATS.
THEY ARE JUST UNDER THE
IMPRESSION THAT THEY WOULD
RATHER BE THERE, MAINTAIN THE
PROBLEMS AS THE STORM WAS
ROLLING IN THAN COME AND DEAL
WITH THEM LATER PARTICULARLY
BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE THEY LIVE.
THERE IS A SCIENCE TO
MAINTAINING THE LINES WITH THE
BOATS OR MORE OF AN ART.
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE IS
ENOUGH SLACK IN THE LINES SO AS
THE WATER COMES UP YOU DON'T
PULL THE BOAT AWAY FROM THE
DOCK ITSELF BUT YOU WANT TO
HAVE THE LINES TIGHT ENOUGH
THAT YOU DON'T THRASH AROUND
AND BANG INTO THE OTHER BOATS
AND THE KIND OF THING THE
PEOPLE WANT TO MAINTAIN OUT

THAT BEING SAID, A LOT OF
PEOPLE THINK THAT AGAIN THE
WORST OF THE STORM IS GOING TO

PEOPLE DID WAKE UP TO THE NEWS

A CATEGORY 4 STORM.
WE SAW THINGS LIKE PEOPLE IN
THE AREA BOARDING UP THIS
MORNING.
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.
SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WERE
PEOPLE READY?
THEY THINK THEY'RE AS READY AS
THEY NEED TO BE.
A LOT OF OPTIMISM THIS FAR WEST
AND PEOPLE HOPING THEY CAN RIDE
OUT THE STORM AND HOPE THE
WORST HITS FURTHER TO THE EAST
OF THEM, SANDRA.
>> Sandra: ONE OF THOSE THINGS
WHERE WE'RE WATCHING THIS ALONG
WITH OUR AUDIENCE AND YOU JUST
WONDER IF FOLKS AROUND YOU ARE
TAKING A PRETTY CASUAL APPROACH
TO LOOKS LIKE AN ENORMOUS STORM
HEADED THAT WAY, MIKE.
ARE YOU SEEING STORM SURGE
THERE YET?
PREDICTIONS NOW UP TO 13 FEET.
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE REALLY
DANGEROUS FACTOR TO THIS STORM.
>> I CAN SHOW YOU THE STORM
SURGE RIGHT NOW.
KEEP IN MIND WE'RE AT A MEAN
TIDE RIGHT NOW.
THE WATER SHOULD BE PRETTY LOW.
THE EDGE OF THIS BOAT SHOULD BE
PARALLEL WITH THE DOCK.
THIS ISN'T ONE OF THOSE
FLOATING DOCKS, IT OTHER FIXED.
THE WATER LEVEL SHOULD BE LOW
AND THE BOAT PARALLEL WITH THE
TOP OF THE DOCK.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF WATER THAT
HAS ALREADY COME IN IN THE
