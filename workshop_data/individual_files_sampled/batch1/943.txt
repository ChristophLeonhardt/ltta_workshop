Donald Trump first alleged hitter spy in the camp over the weekend meeting with South Korea's president at the White House on Tuesday he said there was potential for a massive scandal a lot of people are saying they had spies in my campaign if they had spies at my campaign that would be a disgrace to this country that would be one of the biggest in selfs that anyone's ever seen and it would be very illegal aside from everything else it would make probably every political event ever look like small potatoes the president is angry after US media reports began circulating that while he was on the campaign trail the FBI had an informant meeting senior campaign aides it's understood the informant was helping the investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump team that was before Robert Mueller's appointment a special counsel to investigate just that President Trump wanted to know if the informant was there for political purposes if the Obama administration had anything to do with it and so demanded an investigation and during a meeting with Deputy Attorney General rod Rosen Stein and the head of the FBI Christopher Rea on Monday he was told he would get just that an internal Department of Justice investigation into Russian collusion has just been expanded normally the DOJ gets on with investigations without presidential involvement Trump is challenging the FBI and the Justice Department and most people think that that's unfortunate he will if he keeps it up he will weaken the Justice Department and the FBI and eventually it could be a crisis but I don't think it is yet some Republican politicians are now demanding a second special counsel to investigate the FBI and the DOJ no official at the Justice Department can ever allow their own political bias to overwhelm their own objectivity and responsible performance of their duties a second special counsel must be appointed and transparency and accountability is demanded for these great legend or legendary historic agencies expanding the come Justice Department inquiry seems to have come the president for now but this is a topic you will return to especially while the special counsels Russia investigation continues allons al Jazeera Washington
