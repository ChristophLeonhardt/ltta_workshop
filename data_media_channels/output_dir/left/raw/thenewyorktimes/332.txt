1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,050
It’s a tale of two memos.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,000
One from Republican Representative Devin Nunes.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,710
And one from Democratic Representative Adam Schiff.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,680
First, the Nunes memo.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,680
In 2016, the F.B.I. and Justice Department

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,860
applied for a warrant to
wiretap a former Trump campaign adviser.

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,500
The now declassified
Nunes memo

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,960
asserts that officials
relied on information

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,020
from former British intelligence
officer Christopher Steele,

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,000
without adequately
explaining to the judge

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,850
that Democrats had
financed the research.

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,130
Trump’s allies say
the Nunes memo shows

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,630
that the F.B.I.'s 
Russia investigation

14
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,200
was politically biased 
in its early stages.

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,960
President Trump cleared
the way for its release.

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,590
Democrats, including Adam Schiff,

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,040
have proposed their own
currently classified memo

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,140
at the same time

19
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,490
so the public can
judge both together.

20
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,610
It apparently explains why
various points in the Nunes memo

21
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,500
are wrong or misleading.

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,380
For example, sources say
the information from Steele

23
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,990
was only one thread in
a tapestry of evidence

24
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,860
from various sources that the
Nunes memo ignored,

25
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,970
exaggerating its relative importance.

26
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,820
But Republicans made
the Nunes memo public

27
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,340
without simultaneously making
the rebuttal Schiff memo public, too.

28
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,970
It seems to be an
attempt to shift focus away

29
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,160
from the Russia
investigation itself

30
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,580
and toward what they’re trying
to argue is the real scandal:

31
00:01:17,580 --> 00:00:00,000
the investigators.
