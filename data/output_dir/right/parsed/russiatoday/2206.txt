ponds of gold have rained down on an
airport in northern Siberia now after
the doors of a cargo plane carrying the
precious metal failed the plane was
carrying nine tons of gold worth nearly
400 million dollars from a mine in the
region according to local media a
hundred and seventy two gold bars have
been recovered so far police have now
cordoned off the runway as I would
expect in the Russian city of Yakutsk
and are searching for the rest
