there have been a number of protesters who have showed up to the DC apartment of steven miller who's the very trump adviser who pushed for Trump's euro Paul zero tolerance policy separating children from their parents as they seek asylum and Elaine Chao and Mitch McConnell were also targeted by protesters as well and I want to be clear none of these protests got violent none of them were even large protests no one got touched it anyway but there is a you know some issue with people showing up to people's homes now that's a debate which we will probably have but first let's start off with the video of the protesters in front of Stephen Miller's DC apartment so there it is I mean it seems like a very secure building it doesn't seem like he was in actually it wasn't even home let's keep it 100 yeah he's on business he was not right yeah destroying people's lives yeah that's his business and then there's the video featuring Elaine Chao and her husband Mitch McConnell the protestors approached them after they left an event at Georgetown University we have a video of that and I enjoyed Elaine Chows response to the protesters I'm gonna be honest take a look so I have a new honest opinion on this and Anna you're in favor of protestors doing this stuff in public and by the way you know she says leave my husband alone but I'm sure the protestors were targeting Mitch McConnell was the leader the Republicans in the Senate but Elaine Chao is also a trump administration officials so they might have been talking about you too she's in Trump's cabinet and and so my look in some ways we did this a long time ago as I've explained on the show before in post games in old schools which you can get if you're a member T y-t-dot-com slash joined to become a member and get all of our shows Dave and I were on a plane once with a bush administration official I kept getting his name wrong it's Dan Bartlett okay and and and Dave before we got on the plane had told him you know you've done great damage to the country but he had his earphones in and he wasn't sure he heard it so as we got onto the plane and Dan Bartlett was in first class worker in coach as we're going back and I said you know you've done great damage to our country and he said yeah I know your friend told me already and and I said you shouldn't have let Dick Cheney roll over you guys because he was not the most conservative out of the bush and White House but plenty conservative enough right so to me saying that in public without getting hostile is obviously perfectly acceptable I've done it in the past and there's been plenty of right where here's who've done it to me and yelling at me at airports way louder and then you've seen in in left-wing protests or anything certainly that that I did but I am worried about going to people's homes I think that does cross the line if somebody's afraid to come out of their house especially if they got a family there I'm worried about that man so I'm not convinced that that's a good yeah I I hear you on that so far from what I've seen I'm comfortable um I liked that video that I mean no one's threatening physical danger or harm to anyone but I also hear you I mean how far will it go I mean at what point is it gonna go too far I do think about that and I do think that it could be a slippery slope even though I don't really like slippery slope arguments but look with all that said the reason why I'm starting to be more open or receptive to these forms of protest is because what we've been doing has not worked and we keep getting this messaging from the establishment and also from Republicans Trump supporting Republicans said oh this is this is gonna backfire this is not gonna work right you need to stop this is it no we're not gonna stop it we're not gonna stop it because you know one's interested in a civil debate no one's interested in debating the facts no one's interested in talking about what's really happening in the country to me this this administration is putting our entire Constitution and system of government in jeopardy Trump wants to do things unilaterally he wants to you know do away with judges do away with having to you know deal with Congress and it's unacceptable he is solidifying his own power and causing untold harm to all these innocent people no I can't have it I can't have it I know this is a crazy thing to even bring up and I don't think that our society is headed in this direction but you know when I watch Handmaid's Tale this is not a spoiler but in Handmaid's Tale you know they're in this dystopian society right and the the women who are suffering in this dystopian society keep having flashbacks to when they were still free but things were kind of starting to fall apart and they were still kind of complacent you know they didn't like what was going on but they didn't want to like get involved in protests or ruffle feathers or stir the pot and then before they know it they lose their freedom and I'm not saying that's a fear monger I'm saying that because it is possible for a democracy to be destroyed and I'm concerned about that so let's a couple of different issues here number one it is a form of power that the left wing is now using and that is why it is making people very uncomfortable and so we have no other forms of power our votes don't count because the donors overwhelm us with their access to the politicians they use it to buy TV ads and digital ads now and flyers etc and and they bought our democracy so we used to have an outlet it was called democracy and that is unfortunately at the national level nearly dead so then when you turn to media outside of TYT who's out there fighting for you and you turn on cable news well Republicans say this and the Democrats say that and Trump says this and Democrats say that but the establishment Democrats aren't on our side they fight us in every single primary they fight us in every way and so and and and television doesn't have any Bernie Sanders supporters on it doesn't have any real progressives on it has corporate it's democrats on establishment Democrats on so they bottle you up and bottle you up and bottle you up so now when you actually speak out with your actual voice because you don't other than us you don't have a media outlet and and no one's representing you guys and then when you do that everybody comes down on you like a ton of bricks right right so I understand that a million percent the second thing I understand is that I did there who started this are you kidding me I mean put a sign Charlottesville and all the other violent rallies that they have done and the tea party people spitting on Democratic congressmen as they were going into Congress and we're having a conversation about who started it and who likes to intimidate people physically but I'll go all the way back to 2000 during the recount if you don't remember they actually got Republican lobbyists to go and rattle the people trying to do a recount in miami-dade they actually banged on the doors and they started making people afraid for their lives until they stopped the recount as it turns out every press organization did a recount and gore would've won Florida he didn't just win the popular vote he would electoral vote but those Republican lobbyist thugs threaten violence to get their way now you're gonna talk to us about how you're worried that the left is too uncivil so I don't buy that at all but the one place where I am drawing a line on anything it's important is have a little bit of physical distance between you guys and again the same right wing with their total fake fake concern and crying you know you're the ones who send people to clinics to yell at poor women who are making the most difficult choice of their lives and you're trying to get between them and then a doctor and you hold up horrific pictures and you get right up in their grill in their face and you try to intimidate them yes with your physicality and then you're telling us that you're worried about the left wing being too physical no no hell no the right wing doesn't get to complain about anything given their track record and then the rest of the media the fifty-fifty nonsense is infuriating but guys I look my I'm not in the camp of if they go low we go high that's how you lose no no no we go they go low you punch them in the face politically I say every time politically so we have to fight back super aggressively but we start going to people's houses and I don't know where that ends because they're vicious and they are part of the authoritarian logic of the right is that violence is not a bad thing and so everybody starts showing up at people's houses and it's gonna get ugly so you know what I say look I love shaking the rafters but don't get as close as that situation with Elaine Chao was in my opinion right and you can just be a little bit more distant and still so they can't have an excuse if I was worried for my safety right but you could still be loud you could still be there you know where you should go you should go to where the donors bribe all these politicians oh man that's gonna spook them because those donors they love to working in the dark they love to work in the shadows sure yes that that would be good but I I think that what's far more effective is making these people understand that you don't get to enjoy you know these lovely moments in public spaces when you're destroying the lives of other people which is why I love the restaurant her husband I do I do I'm sorry and look I would not be saying this if we're just dealing with Republican lawmakers that we disagree with on policy there are people on the right that I disagree with but I don't find them to be deplorable human beings right we just have different perspectives different interpretations different policy ideas I would be very much against this if we start going after people over those types of issues my issue with the Trump administration is their utter disdain for a democratic system that is my issue and and how their disdain for that democratic system has translated into all of this cruelty and harm toward innocent people that is my problem why we're gonna ask you guys to because I'm genuinely curious about your opinion that's when we asked you guys question so the question in this case is should people protest outside of Trump administration officials homes yes or no if you're watching it on Facebook I think that'll pop up in the video and we'll have that question everywhere for you guys should people protest outside of Trump administration officials homes so for whatever it's worth that's where I would draw the line and I don't want to get too close to a situation that create any kind of physical confrontation but if you're seizing power back by showing up and making your voices heard it's about time we did something and and
