here in Palestinian territory the people
are blessed with stuff from Banksy on
the wall so here the Palestinian instead
of throwing a Molotov cocktail is
throwing flowers because of course the
Palestinians have never thrown anything
like Molotov cocktails or known anyone
up or thrown any bullets all they've
ever done is is thrown flowers and
sprayed perfume because that's who the
Palestinians really are yes sure Banksy
thanks I think we'll stick with say
though I'm here getting the Palestinian
side of the story if you want to hear
more from the rebel team join us at
rebel is real calm
