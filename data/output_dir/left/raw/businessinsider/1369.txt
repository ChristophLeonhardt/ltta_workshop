00:00:02,929 --> 00:00:05,400
we've all heard the term pivot before

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">but typically when it's used in the</font>

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,080
context of startups and businesses pivot

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,360
refers to plan B when it comes to our

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,170
all together but the key is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be asking and answering the</font>

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,440
frequently than in years past and one of

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,390
the biggest mistakes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I made when</font>

16

pivoting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I see other pivot errs</font>

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,190
make is ignoring what's already working

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,170
and focusing too much on what's not

19
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,270
working what they don't know and what

20
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,160
they don't have so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

can scan for passing options with their

32
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,229
pivot foot so while you have one part of

<font color="#E5E5E5">you that's rooted in your existing</font>

36
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,360
and projects that look interesting for

this next direction<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> career then</font>

38
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,900
the third stage of the pivot method is

41
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,450
the court piloting is about running

42
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,490
small experiments with ten to twenty

45

over and over in some cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> for months</font>

49
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,450
if not years perfectly happily just

50
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,759
experimenting doubling back down on your

51
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,290
strengths and what's already working and

52
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,930
scanning and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually it comes</font>

53
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,030
time to make a shot or what i call in

54
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,100
the pivot method launch so this would be

55
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,560
when you one of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> pilot's starts</font>

56
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,780
taking off and you decide to go all in

57
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,180
on the new direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> by repeating plants</font>

58
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,429
can pilot you reduce risk but ultimately

59
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">when it comes time for a launch whether</font>

60
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,150
that's quitting your job or starting a

61
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,960
business

62
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,630
you go all in even with any remaining

63
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,970
uncertainty and most pivotal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spoke</font>

64
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">with never regret their launch decision</font>

even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if things don't pan out exactly as</font>

66
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,930
they planned by the time you launch you

67
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,030
know that you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> regret staying in</font>

68
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,090
place more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> launching and then</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">having to readjust if things don't work</font>

70

out as planned
