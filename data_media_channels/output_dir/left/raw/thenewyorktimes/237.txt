1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,969
“You and your co-founders started
a company in your dorm room

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,610
that’s grown to be one of
the biggest and most successful

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,770
businesses in the entire world.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,720
While Facebook has
certainly grown,

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,180
I worry it may not have matured.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,920
I think it’s time to
ask whether Facebook

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,370
may have moved too fast
and broken too many things.”

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,640
“Who do you think owns an
individual’s presence online?

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,280
Who owns their virtual you?

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,790
Is it you or is it
them?”

11
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,620
“Congresswoman, I believe that everyone 
owns their own content online.

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,770
And that’s the first line
of our terms of service,

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,650
if you read it, says that.”

14
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,920
“After this new algorithm was

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,590
implemented, that there
was a tremendous bias

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,230
against conservative
news and content

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,470
and a favorable bias
towards liberal content.

18
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,870
Was there a directive
to put a bias in

19
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,700
and first are you
aware of this bias

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,920
that many people have looked
at and analyzed and seen?”

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,780
“ Congressman, this is a
really important question.

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,260
There is absolutely no
directive in any of the changes

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,180
that we make to have
a bias in anything

24
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,330
that we do.“

25
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,330
”Well, you have a long
history of growth and success.

26
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,300
But you also have a
long list of apologies.

27
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,940
In 2003, it started at Harvard.

28
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,270
‘I apologize for any harm
done as a result of my neglect.’

29
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,300
2006: ‘We really
messed this one up.’

30
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,470
2007: ‘We simply did a bad job.

31
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,300
I apologize for it.’

32
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,300
This is proof to me that
self-regulation simply

33
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,770
does not work.”

34
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,470
“Are you aware of other
third-party information mishandlings

35
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,927
that have not been disclosed?”

36
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:35,227
“Congresswoman, no, although we

37
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:37,560
are currently going through
the process of investigating

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,470
every single app—”

39
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,410
“So you’re not sure?”

40
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,712
—that had access
to a large amount of data.”

41
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:41,734
”All right, but—

42
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:42,734
I only have four minutes.

43
00:01:42,734 --> 00:01:45,270
Was your data included

44
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,310
in the data sold to the
malicious third parties?

45
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,740
Your personal data?”

46
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,470
“Yes.”

47
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,990
“If you don't, 
you’re not listening

48
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,680
to us on the phone,

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,900
who is, and do you
have specific contracts

50
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,560
with these companies
that will provide

51
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,670
data that is being
acquired verbally

52
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,758
through our phones
or now through things

53
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:14,080
like Alexa or other products?”

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,507
“Congressman, we’re not collecting
any information verbally

55
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:19,090
on the microphone, and we don’t
have contracts with anyone else

56
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,090
who is.”

57
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,790
“Facebook has
detailed profiles

58
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,160
on people who have never
signed up for Facebook.

59
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,200
Yes or no?”

60
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,321
“Congressman, in general,
we collect data

61
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:32,820
from people have not signed up for
Facebook for security purposes

62
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,903
to prevent the kind of
scraping that you were just

63
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:35,740
referring to.”

64
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,660
”As C.E.O., you didn’t know
some key facts.

65
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,200
You didn’t know about major court
cases regarding your privacy

66
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,170
policies against your company.

67
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,070
You didn’t know that the F.T.C.
doesn’t have fining authority

68
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,830
and that Facebook could not
that have received fines

69
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,520
for the 2011 consent order.

70
00:02:56,520 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn’t know what
a shadow profile was.”
