speaking of bosses on ice Oh AR won two gold medals at these Olympics and the first one was no less special and women's ice skating - Russian teenage girls topped the podium after breaking two World Records one after another within 15 minutes but of course you can't share one gold and thanks to one extra point from the jury Alina Ziggy tava a 15 year old girl from a chefs became the champion and we were the first TV channel to talk to her after she got off the podium in an exclusive interview didn't know you yeah before competition I fully distanced myself from the outside world I don't read or watch the news just some TV series this time I was very calm - I didn't mind the attention from the journalists fans and the fact that I'm participating in the Olympic Games for me it was the same as any other competition of course I supported the other athletes from Russia but I didn't feel this big burden of responsibility maybe that helped me you were so calm after your performance never once said that the only source single tear what did you do to say so calmly that's not what cancer actually there were no tears at all I'm always like that keeping my emotions to myself but when I go home I always share all my emotions with my parents I think when I get home I will be dancing and jumping for joy I hope by the time I get home I will realize what I have achieved my Osho for me there's the collage topic I see so you haven't been jumping and dancing so far I call anybody go up only during my routine what about your relationship with the Afghan you made visible your rivals and ice but is it true that you're actually friends yes absolutely we often go to have a coffee or a chat on social media between training we always share funny videos on the Instagram and have a good laugh together yes today's mission yes that I was you said you don't notice the media attention but we have to ask you about the American skater Ashley Wagner who criticized your routine saying the putting all the very complicated elements at the end is basically cheating what would you say to her I can say that this only encouraged me to do more and better I wanted to prove even more that what she was saying is not true but you cannot prove anything to people like her I say let her compete in the Olympics with my program and I'll gladly see how she'll manage to do it of course figure skating is developing really fast nowadays there's always a new generation younger than me maybe someday I might think like that too because in my group there are already some girls who can do quadruple jumps but I will try as hard as I can to stay in sports as long as I can I'm already thinking about the next season is that everything but is skating all you think about but for now I cannot think about anything else I try to be as careful as I can and not make any mistakes so I can stay in skating for as long as I can the doors rest out so I think it's portable
