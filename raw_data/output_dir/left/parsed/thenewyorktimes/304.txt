“And that's how you jump out
of an airplane, babe.”
He told me just because
I’m thousands of miles away,
like, I will be so
present in your life.
“Phew, made it safe.”
He told me that they
were going to not
return to that base —
different mission.
I told him I loved him.
Love you too, darling.
I’ll talk to you as soon as
I get back to base.
“I’ll talk to you later. Bye.”
And the rest is just a big blur.
When Dustin was in Africa, 
that mailbox was exciting.
I would skip to it.
He sent four letters.
He gave me one at the
airport when he left.
Every letter after that
came with 30 index cards.
I was supposed to read an
index card every day
when I woke up.
I saw him from across
the crowd with his hat on
and his sweaty shirt.
I said, hey — it’s like, hi.
It’s like — want to dance?
Yes, I do.
It was a feeling that I
never felt with anyone else,
of just completeness.
I have the original dog tag
that he put around my neck
before he left for
this deployment.
This was the week that Dustin
would have been coming home.
His stuff came back from Africa.
I found every receipt from
every interaction we had.
I found little notes of
things he wanted to tell me.
I just wanted my
lips on his lips.
I have all these
wonderful memories.
This grand love story.
But all my heart wants is just
him to be on my couch right now,
watching Netflix
and being normal.
I want to make him dinner.
And I want ...
That’s all we wanted.
I would love to hear
new words from him.
But he gave me a
lot of good stuff.
Still to this day, that mailbox
is my favorite thing.
And it’s what haunts me.
“I just read your letter,
and I don't know how you were
able to put it in words exactly
how both of us were feeling.
How everything we do for each other
is genuinely real ...”
