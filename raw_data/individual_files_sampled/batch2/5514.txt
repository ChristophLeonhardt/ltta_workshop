joining me now I guess Chris Hill former US ambassador to South Korea and MSNBC diplomacy contributor and of course our panel is still here Hugh Hewitt you Michel sindoor and Howard Fineman all right ambassador who's who's who got this delayed is it really the US side or was it the Chinese I you know I can't buy this our argument that the Chinese somehow put the kibosh on this I think the Chinese have wanted this to go forward they'd like to be sort of a part of the process but I can't believe they would have told Kim not to do this I think it's a combination of Kim getting kind of nervous about the idea that he's supposed to give away everything for essentially a promise and I think it was the president getting nervous that maybe the North Koreans weren't going to do this but you know at the end of the day they've got to project the kind of smoother team than they've got and this idea of the president you know dictating something to John Bolton sending it out without mentioning it to Mike Pompeo who's been the point guy on all this it just is beginning to look a little ragged and frankly embarrassing to the to the rest of the world you mean you know the whole reason that McMaster until erson were out was to smooth out this issue finally the president is going to have a Secretary of State in the national security advisor at least that he gets along with they they may but once again it's an old fashioned it looks like the NS the NS a is in one place secretary states in another we've seen this in previous White House well think about all the different personnel changes but the person at the center of all this ration is is Donald Trump there are I talk to so many White House officials yesterday I was asking all sorts of questions did he do this because he thought Kim was gonna do cancel it what else is going on like who why would you dictate it in this way what is this North Korean kind of nuclear threat that's and that was kind of in the middle of a letter about you know we don't want it we pray we don't have to use our nuclear weapons at the end of the day president Trump made this decision and he's going to continue to be the person that decides with using his gut how he does foreign policy and this is the way he does it it's kind of an art of the deal style let's kind of throw stuff out there and see what they do everyone from the White House said that this was at the end of the day President Trump's decision and that he was the one who was led to do this and then yeah there might be people around him that are arguing but he's the one that wants to do what he wants to do look President Trump was setting China setting up China as the fall guy as early as Tuesday take a listen I will say I'm a little disappointed because when Kim jong-un had the meeting with President Xi in China the second meeting the first meeting we knew about the second meeting I think there was a little change in attitude from kim jeong-hoon so I don't like that I don't like that well look I don't think that anything that the president has done yet has risen to the level that the Chinese need to deploy their master strategy I mean Donald Trump is playing jacks and undestood marbles on the street the Chinese have been doing this for five thousand years the Koreans have been doing it for five thousand years this is not the City Council on a real estate deal it's not the Zoning Commission these are people in a region of the world where they move in long term long horizon fashion that's I mean the Chinese are looking I'm sure at Donald Trump saying how do we how do we stand away far enough that we don't push him into a corner Hugh do you see the ziti this whole ZTE issue the Trump administration's desperately trying to fix for China no I part of this I think it's overstated that the Secretary of State did not know what was going on I believe the Secretary of Defense did as well and that they were all coordinated I will say this Donald Trump's muscle memory is to go into and to leave negotiations whether you reorganize his debt in 1990 he left the meetings twice through down and said I'm in default and this is what he knows and this is what he does and I think by the way it could very well turn out to have worked out very very well ambassador Hill the most another oddity about this whole thing had to do with Mike the curious way that Mike Pompeo when he was a he was reading the letter to Congress and they were asked about well they seemed to notify the Japanese but it was pretty clear they didn't notify the South Koreans what do you make of that and what are the South Koreans make of this you know I think the South Koreans put a lot of conspiracy into this they think that President Trump is soured on president moon I think it's just kind of chaos in the White House and not knowing how to get your paperwork done I don't you know John Bolton's a lot of things but I don't think he's a good note taker and for stenographer and so I think there was just a kind of a sense that they everything's being done in a kind of chaotic way and I wouldn't be surprised that they forgot to tell people I I think they they just have trouble doing things normally so you think it's that they didn't tell the South Korea day oh gosh we forgot to call them to I think at the end of the day the president wants this to happen and I suspect it's going to happen in some way shape or form and I think he ought to have a look at John Bolton and say John are you with me on this or are you not because if you're not with me I'm not really sure how we're gonna work together I'd give that a few you know a couple more weeks to play out but I mean yeah you've got to be able to kind of manage some things weather you know various staffers don't want to do it or not they need to be able to manage things before I get the panel away in here I want to ask you about one conspiracy theory out there do you think Bolton and pence intentionally dangled the Libya model to try to kill it let's try to kill this summit get bastard Hill you know John Bolton is a lot of things but he's not dumb and I think he knows precisely what it meant to talk about a Libya model where the dictator ends up dead in the street and the idea that tense then brings up brings it up again I think really concerned the North Koreans in the sense that they felt that John Bolton's views were spreading through the administration you is it Bultman pence versus Trump and Pompeyo no I am a friend of John Bolton and of Mike Pompeo surrender is not an option as John Bolton memoir which I read very closely he's a very good note-taker I don't believe anything was unintentional in any of this nor do I think it's a coordinated no I think solidity option is actually capable of being read either the 2003 Libya option the 2011 Libyan option it's actually kind of a master but you talked about muscle memory having having been in the Trump Tower offices with the candidate Trump and watching the way that thing flowed careful note-taking is not one of the things not the presence one of the things that goes on in there and and I think he's the the president is feeling this out moment by moment it's the ultimate culture clash in an attempt at diplomacy in the Trump operates in a way that I think the Chinese and the Koreans and the Japanese fine almost utterly comprehensible but it could work I was just got to say this this has been the Trump's hey you never know it could it could work and everyone that I talked to you know one said this is completely not gonna happen everyone said the president will probably end up sitting down with him it'll probably just little probably look like president Trump backed out then he's gonna be able to claim victory that he you know what I along was the one who could put this back on the table and then when he does go to Singapore to wherever this meeting ends up being it's gonna be all this pomp and circumstance and he's gonna be able to say guess what it was the the danger is at the third part of his muscle memory is being able to turn even the smallest little project into the greatest thing that ever happened in other words if he actually gets in there he's gonna declare victory about something and we don't know what that's something clearly there are the three Americans home who would not otherwise be home and we're learning pattern recognition of North Koreans we've never seen them do anything before so we're learning about them as we go along ambassador hill the one thing we haven't talked about it what the heck should be on the table when the two of them actually meet I think that's been part of the problem here they don't know what they're negotiating well you've got it I mean I don't think the North Koreans already were close to you know wheeling up some Winnebago and saying here's all our nuclear stuff take it away so I think there's a problem there and I think the administration might consider doing a little less public posturing on it get some teams sit down with the North Koreans put a draft communique say look this is what we want as an outcome and then try to negotiate something maybe they won't get a hundred percent but they at least get some idea of what the North Koreans are prepared to do don't forget just meeting the president is a big deal for Kim Jong on his dad never did it as grandfather never did it's a very big deal for him so we need to get an idea of what it is he's willing to do and so far I don't think we have that that's a great point
