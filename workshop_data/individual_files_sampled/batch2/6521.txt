one of the most corrupt politicians in America Duncan Hunter ran an ad against his Democratic opponent Ammar campa√±a jar and this ad is so stupid and so over-the-top and so bigoted that it almost seems fake a markup on a jar is working to infiltrate Congress he has three different names to hide his family's ties to terrorism his grandfather masterminded the Munich Olympic Massacre his father said they deserved to die a palestinian mexican millennial democrat named amar campin Lazar doesn't get his support from the people of San Diego he is being supported by care and the Muslim Brotherhood this is a well orchestrated plan a markup on a job a risk we can't ignore on Duncan Hunter and I approve this message I'm at a loss for words I'm at a loss for words every part of that was grotesque and stupid it was just stupid okay so look at the framing the framing is and if you didn't get that I don't know why you wouldn't it's not even close to subtle mm-hmm trying to paint him as a terrorist at worst at best a terrorist sympathizer it said he's trying to infiltrate he's a Palestinian Mexican Democrat millennial he's supported by the Muslim Brotherhood what and the don't let him put you at risk with this well orchestrated plan and then at the end you see Duncan Hunter dressed in his military gear by the way when he was in Iraq in illegal offensive war against a country that didn't attack us but so do you see what he's doing there he's trying to portray a mark on a jar as a terrorist or terrorist sympathizer and he's trying to being open and outright and flagrant bigot in order to try to scare the Republican base into voting for him now remember Duncan Hunter has a lot to distract from go back and watch the segments if you haven't yet but Duncan Hunter was actually nabbed for over-the-top corruption I mean corruption that's as over-the-top as this ad is it you know he was spending campaign money for himself and his wife in gratuitous asinine ways almost to the point where you're thinking like how can you be this dumb I mean you're really dense aren't you dude but I mean call this what it is man he's playing identity politics to try to get elected and the funny thing is um our competitor has made a point to not play identity politics go watch the interview he did or actually I think we covered it he did an interview with Jiang cougar on TYT interviews and he said listen this campaign we're giving people something to vote for not just something to vote against he's a Bernie sander style candidate he takes no corporate PAC money he's for Medicare for all living wage I mean you go down the list of all the important populace left policies that's what he's running on he hasn't said a goddamn thing about identity but who's playing identity politics the far-right Duncan Hunter his supporters are playing identity politics and just outright lying the Muslim Brotherhood support what the fuck are you talking about the Muslim Brotherhood supports him again trying to scare a Republican base voters into voting for him because they think oh my god it's a well orchestrated plan and is putting the country at risk so he's actually trying to argue like oh he's a he's like a Manchurian Candidate he's like a stealth jihadist this is what you do when you have no substance to run on Duncan Hunter does nothing for the people as a congressman again he's one of the most corrupt politicians in the country he has nothing to run on for the people so what does he do smear smear in the most stunningly obtuse and gross and bigoted way possible that's what this is it's it's a smear job and I don't know about you guys but that makes me wish I could vote for a mark camp in a jar unfortunately I'm obviously not in his district but for those of you who are you better get out there and vote men I haven't seen a clear election ever like I haven't seen a clear example of oh this one's not even close this is like good versus evil a markup in a jar being good Duncan Hunter being evil which I know flips his head on its head but that's the reality of the situation one guy's gonna fight for your health care for your wages he's gonna fight for a new new deal he's gonna try to improve the country the other guy has nothing but smears and calls his opponent a terrorist and pretends like he's a stealth jihadist and plays identity politics to get elected because that's all he's got why would you bring up that his background is Palestinian and Mexican why would you bring that up what have to do anything was I have to do anything I has nothing to do with anything you brought it up because you're playing identity politics and guys that's an important point that I don't think has made nearly a much as much as it should be which is it's often portrayed like oh only the Left plays identity politics well that's not true the people on the far right do play at any politics also and you just saw it it's white identity politics it's like I'm gonna try to scare you to vote against this scary brown person and you better go do it now he's got nothing I say he's got nothing substance to say so he smears that's honestly one of the grossest had ads I've ever seen in politics and I've seen a lot of them
