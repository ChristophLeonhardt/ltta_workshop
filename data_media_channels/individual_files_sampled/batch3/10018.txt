no Trump no war that was the message to the American president from protesters in Seoul the head of his speech to the South Korean National Assembly in his address Trump described North Korea as a quote hell that no one deserves while also issuing a stark warning to its leader when I say to the north do not underestimate us and do not try us we will defend our common security our shared prosperity and our sacred Liberty well the next leg of president Trump's Asia trip is China it's a much-anticipated visit as America reports as Donald Trump arrives in China on his five nation Asia tour it's now the Chinese president's turn to roll out the red carpet just six months ago the Chinese leader came to Washington and the two hit it off bonding over chocolate cake but Trump couldn't help but be a bit theatrical during the dinner topping the Magnificent dessert with the show of Washington's military might we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you've ever seen and President Xi was enjoying it so what happens as I said we've just launched 59 missiles heading to Iraq well headed to Syria yes heading toward Syria Trump loves his weapon so much he thinks they're the solution to every problem and when the threat is as serious as North Korea all the other countries in the region must be armed to the teeth and prepared to respond well that's the idea he's been trying to sell on his Asia trip so far in both Japan and South Korea Japan is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment as he should South Korea will be ordering billions of dollars of that equipment we make the best military equipment by far we make the greatest military equipment in the world the f-35 fighter which is the greatest in the world the greatest in the world missiles of many different kinds whether it's planes whether it's missiles we make the best the greatest military equipment by far in the world be purchasing it from the United States thank you very much now Trump is counting on the Chinese president to back him up as he puts pressure on Pyongyang gee where we will be tomorrow China has been very helpful we'll find out how helpful soon but he really has been very very helpful well it's often said that diplomacy is merely seduction in another guise so the question is will Trump's efforts to seduce the Chinese leader carry over and will he be able to strike a sweet deal for the u.s. Samira Khan RT Washington DC International Relations expert Victor Gao says that Trump's harsh words for Pyongyang simply put are unhelpful president Donald Trump is a very controversial president but I think from the Chinese perspective we need to deal with the presidency of the United States very seriously so whatever rhetoric or other things which president honor Trump may resort to China need to stand firm on its own principle and do the right thing president Donald Trump has been known in recent months for using very inflammatory rhetoric about DPRK and I personally believe these rhetorics very threatening in nature a threatening war war mongering for example is not helpful at all ever since President Donald Trump went into the White House the United States has been selling huge amount of military weapons to many countries in different parts of the world selling more weapons may actually make whatever military confrontation which may happen even more bloody causing more loss of life and that's the wrong thing to do at this very particular moment when peace is at stake
