THE WORLD AND THEY HAVE DONE AN 
OUTSTANDING JOB PROTECTING US 
BUT WE HAVE TO HELP THE NYPD 
AND I WANT TO REALLY EMPHASIZE 
EVERY DAY PEOPLE CAN PLAY AN 
INCREDIBLE ROLE HELPING LAW 
ENFORCEMENT BY GETTING ANY 
INFORMATION YOU HAVE ON WHO 
MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN THIS PLOT 
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND BY BEING 
VERY VIGILANT ABOUT ANY 
PACKAGES THAT COME IN. 
THE PATTERN OF THESE PACKAGES 
HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY 
CONSISTENT BUT THAT DOES NOT 
MEAN THAT IF SOMETHING COMES IN 
THE LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT, 
PEOPLE SHOULD NOT TAKE IT 
SERIOUSLY IF IT IS SUSPICIOUS 
TO THEM. 
WE NEED PEOPLE TO USE COMMON 
SENSE. 
IF THE PACKAGE LOOKS 
SUSPICIOUS, THERE'S ANY KIND OF 
CHEMICAL SMELL, ANY WIRING 
SHOWING, ANY INDICATION OF 
SOMETHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY, 
DO NOT OPEN THE PACKAGE. 
ALERT THE NYPD IMMEDIATELY AND 
CALL 91. 
-- 911. 
BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY. 
THE QUESTION ON ANY BRUNCH MINE 
-- ON EVERYONE'S MIND IS HOW 
LONG WILL THIS GO ON? 
WE CANNOT TELL YOU HOW LONG 
THIS WILL GO EXACTLY. 
WE HAVE TO BE READY FOR ANY 
EVENTUALITY. 
IT MIGHT BE HOURS OR DAYS OR 
WEEKS. 
THE VIGILANCE WE NEED TO SHOW 
IN THE MEANTIME IS WHAT HAST TO 
BE CONSISTENT. 
WE ARE GOING TO BE UPDATING 
PEOPLE IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS, 
THERE WILL BE A PRESS 
CONFERENCE AT ONE POLICE PLAZA, 
SO WE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY 
THERE TO GET INTO DETAIL ABOUT 
THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATION 
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS, 
AGAIN, ANYBODY WHO SEES 
SOMETHING, ANYBODY WHO SEE 
SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS OR CAUSES 
CONCERN, CALL 911 ANYBODY WHO 
HAS INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE BEHIND THESE 
LETTER BOMBS, YOU CAN CALL OUR 
TIP LINE ONE 888 NYC-SAFE. 
THERE SHOWING THE GOODNESS AND 
DECENCY TRUE OF THE CITY ALL 
OVER THIS COUNTRY AND THIS IS 
ULTIMATELY A PAINFUL MOMENT AND 
A FRIGHTENING MOMENTS BUT IN 
THE END, THE GOODNESS OF 
EVERYDAY PEOPLE IS WHAT WILL 
SEE US THROUGH THIS. 
I AM CONVINCED OF THAT. 
PEOPLE HELPING EACH OTHER OUT, 
PEOPLE HAVING EACH OTHER'S 
BACKS, THAT IS HOW THE CITY 
WORKS. 
THIS IS A CITY WHERE 8.6 
MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN A 
PRACTICAL KIND OF HARMONY THAT 
IS EXTRAORDINARY AND SOMETHING 
WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF. 
IT IS AN EXAMPLE TO THE WHOLE 
WORLD. 
NOTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN 
THE LAST DAY OR TWO HAS CHANGE 
THAT. 
WE WILL KEEPING NEW YORKERS AND 
KEEP SHOWING THAT WE CAN GET 
ALONG WITH EACH OTHER AND MAKE 
THINGS WORK. 
JUST A COUPLE WORDS IN SPANISH. 
 
>> YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, 
ESSENTIALLY EXPLAINING TO NEW 
YORKERS AND TO THE REST OF THE 
COUNTRY WHAT NEW YORK POLICE 
HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE WAKE OF 
THESE PACKAGE DELIVERIES THAT 
HAVE HAPPENED IN SOME LOCATIONS 
IN THE SURROUNDING AREA. 
THE MAYOR POINTED OUT THINGS 
THAT ARE NATIONAL SECURITY -- 
THAT NATIONAL SECURITY 
CONSERVATORS HAVE BEEN SAYING, 
LIKE STAYING VIGILANT WITH 
PACKAGES BEING DELIVERED AND 
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN 
TAKE TO HEART, LIKE IT HAS BEEN 
REPORTED THAT THE INDIVIDUAL 
WHO DISCOVERED THE PACKAGE THAT 
WAS DELIVERED TO ROBERT DE NIRO 
WITH SOMEONE WHO HAD WATCH THE 
NEWS BECAME AWARE OF WHAT WAS 
HAPPENING YESTERDAY AND WAS 
ABLE TO CALL THE POLICE, SO THE 
MAYOR ONCE AGAIN IS POINTING 
THAT OUT AND SAYING THE CITY IS 
NOT GOING TO BE INTIMIDATED. 
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
MONITOR ALL DEVELOPMENTS. 
THE STORY IS NOT OVER YET AS 
YOU JUST HEARD FROM ONE OF OUR 
SECURITY CONSULTANTS, AND 
FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 
UNTIL THIS PERSON OR PERSONS 
ARE CAPTURED, IT IS NOT OVER. 
>>> TWO MONTHS AGO, WE TOLD YOU 
ABOUT CHEMICALS IN SOME OF YOUR 
CEREAL. 
>> TWO DOZEN SAMPLES CONTAINED 
UNSAFE LEVELS OF A WEEDKILLER 
THAT IS LINKED TO CANCER. 
THEY STUDIED IT IN AUGUST AND 
REVEALED 31 SAMPLES OF OTHER 
OAT BASED  PRODUCTS, INCLUDING 
SOME ORGANIC THAT CONTAIN THE
