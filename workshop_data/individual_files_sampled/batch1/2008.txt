when it comes to dress shirts you can of course unbutton them for a more relaxed look or you can keep them buttoned up for a more work look but I kind of fall somewhere in the middle I think typically it depends on what else you're wearing with the dress shirt if you're at the office you can definitely unbutton a button or two but I think it's really important that you're wearing something pretty dressy on top of it so a really well structured blazer that's really cut nicely and fits your body maybe even balance that casualness of the shirt with a pocket square just to keep it more professional and then of course if you're off-duty I think you can always wear a more relaxed shirt but I think that two buttons unbuttoned is the max unless you're on a beach in Ibiza sometimes if you have less chest hair you might be able to get away with a third button of course if you're Chris Hemsworth you can unbutton your shirt all the way no one's gonna be mad at you but I think for the most part if you're sporting a lot of chest hair it's best to keep it to one button unbuttoned all the time if you don't have a lot of chest hair you can definitely get away with two but I think three is pushing the limit no matter how ripped or how hairless you are
