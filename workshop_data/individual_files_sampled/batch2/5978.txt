in another voice to the conversation joining us now former US ambassador to South Africa now president of the Open Society Foundations Patrick Gaspard the open society foundation is George Soros is philanthropic organization and yesterday the Ambassador published a response to representative Matt gets his conspiracy theory that Soros is funding the migrant caravan heading for the US mr. ambassador it's good to have you with us this morning this touches you in a lot of different ways you were you work at George Soros you run George Soros organization you work for President Obama or the Manhattan borough president just your reaction first of all to the George Soros planting of an explosive device and apparent explosive device which was really the one that that set all this off and what was mr. Soros his reaction well first let me just thank you for inviting me on into this rather sober conversation and when I have a moment here I'd like to just disagree with points that were made by the two John's well yes this all did begin with a pipe bomb that was sent to George Soros a man who himself is an immigrant refugee from Nazi occupied Hungary and someone who came to the United States it became one of the most invested in successful investors in history George Soros regrettably is not surprised today by these attacks he has been saying for quite some time now that language can be weaponized and that the chief executive of the United States has been spreading a kind of shrapnel with his words and with his tone I appreciate seeing the remarks from President Trump yesterday as he said that we all have to come together and unite in this moment but this is the same president who days before was applauding attacks on the media and who I think there was maybe 48 hours beforehand blamed George Soros for the migrants who are making their way through Honduras into Mexico towards the US border blaming George Soros and Democrats which is exactly what congressman gets did as well that's reprehensible and it's proven to be quite dangerous so as you know mr. ambassador the term George Soros funded has become sort of a buzzword for for conspiracy theorists and others who believe that he's pulling the strings and a lot of things happening around the world right now let's take the example you just raised which is the Caribbean and he's been accused of somehow funding that Caravan what's his response to that well one two things George Soros and the Open Society Foundations have playing absolutely no role in funding any caravan that's marching towards the United States this is a foundation that respects and believes in sovereign borders but at the same time honors the long-held tradition of Republicans and Democrats in the United States of welcoming refugees from violence who have rightful claims to amnesty we have procedures at our borders for that and the president who knows this and knows better should not just be casting blame without evidence on on Americans like George Soros as you mentioned has a question for you mr. ambassador john harmon hey dr. good Patrick good to hear you curious I believe you pointed out that there were obviously recent antecedents where your boss has been invoked in a negative way by the President and others in the Republican Party I believe it is the case and I'd like you to clarify this I believe it's the case the Republican Party we ran an ad attacking George Soros just yesterday even after this attack had taken place is that correct there were yes there was an ad run in a congressional district against former government employee who's running for the House of Representatives who happened to work for a nonprofit organization that received two grants over the course of their history from the open side Foundation and that's been conflated into another grand right-wing conspiracy theory I'd also like to add John we talked about ads that one of the closing ads that Donald Trump had in this campaign was against George Soros Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein who near as I can appreciate share nothing other than their Jewish heritage George Soros has long been a bogeyman of the right-wing I understand those who disagree with his political opinions but I applaud Republican senators like Rand Paul who immediately after this attack stepped forward and said this is wrong this is not who we are I'd also like to add John that George Soros is also the American who right after supporting Barack Obama for the presidency in 2008 against John McCain joined with John McCain in trying to open previously closed societies in Eastern Europe who are still working to emerge from communism same George Soros worked hand-in-hand with John McCain so we just need to pull back the lens appreciate what's being done here the lies that are being spread by congressmen like gets who hails from the same district that your Joe Scarborough used to represent foreign ambassador Patrick Gaspard thank you very much and Jon Meacham before we go to break give us a sense historically of what a dictator what a fascist what a leader with on American intentions would do at a moment like this with a story like this in the run-up to an election you would claim that your enemies had somehow set you up you you would play the what's called a false flag card which you saw immediately happen in the corners of the the make America great again movement yesterday one of the things that one would have to say back to those who I pray it's a vanishingly small but even if it's a small we know that every person matters because any person can do something irrational and violent is if you think or if you pretend to think this is somehow a conspiracy theory that this is a false flag operation ask yourself why would someone think that such an operation would work mm-hmm why would someone think that this would be a reasonable thing to launch and that logic demands that you then realize that a rhetorical climate has been created and exacerbated and maintained that can lead to the worst kinds of events and people who are complicit in this not just those who talk but those who listen and those who tend to believe or want to believe have an extraordinary responsibility because we often say this isn't who we are but often it is but this really can't be who we are it can't be we won't survive it John pidor it's so I think it's important at this moment to point out that in the United States right now we have solid economic growth we have low unemployment we have all kinds of social peace that we haven't had in this we had didn't have in this country in the post-war era low crime you know recovery in a lot of places we have some terrible things the opioid epidemic and everything else this is an unusual set of circumstances and that's one of the reasons that it is fair to blame in some sense the president's rhetoric not only the president's rhetoric but the rhetoric all sorts of irresponsible rhetoric the sort of rhetoric that has led that lead that led howe Canson to shoot up the Congressional softball game thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe
