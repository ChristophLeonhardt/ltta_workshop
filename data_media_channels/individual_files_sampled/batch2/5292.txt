all right uh hey Chris Matthews I want to just ask you a general question about where we are politically right now you know for a lot of people they're defining election was the election of JFK in 1960 for me for a lot of different reasons it was Reagan in 1980 and I always remember on the Friday before it was a toss-up it was going to be very close we're trying to figure out exactly what's gonna happen this fall you have a series of polls out showing Donald Trump in the mid-30s mitch mcconnell's now talking about a night fight in the Senate you never really know which way these things are going but I was just curious when you were with Tip O'Neill in 1980 did you see it coming do you does it does it feel like a similar wave this year or is it just too early to tell well I really was with him from 81 on so the 81 had already happened but 82 was the one I worked on and we picked up 26 seats and that felt like a pretty good way because there's social security and the recession coming on and I think the speaker did a hell of a job of raising those issues I think this is stronger I think it's stronger than 26 I think it's a real wave something like 94 74 I think the Democrats have picked up 30 to 40 seats in this in the house and the Senate is wobbly right now it's March of our country as you know all over the country it looks like these races are coming down to I think I think Donnelly's gonna win in Indiana now I think I think there's a little I think Manchin's going to win now I think there's some safety for some of these guys but I think marginal areas like remember just as recently as 16 we looked at all those races in Pennsylvania when everybody said oh and anyone they'll call me upset will win by three well that's margin of error when you start talking about two or three points you don't know what you're talking about it's too hard to pick this elections gonna be hard to pick but I do think there's a wave against the president I think this last week or two have been terrible for him I looked at the numbers dropping down in the lower 30s for him in approval and these these elections as you know Joe changed history for 30 years people will get elected this November that would have never had a shot people like you've got a lot of Tom Foley out and and I didn't know Eastern Washington State was elected fluky filed the last day he get into the Congress he served for 30 years he became speaker house until the next wave came along in 94 it happens Jim Howard a high school teacher in New Jersey got elected for his whole life because of one of these ways so I think you're gonna embed Oh a better wins down there he's gonna be a major national figure it pretty quickly my god a lot of these people you're gonna see whole careers made or lost and women running minority women women of color I think the fact that there's so many running they're gonna be so many who win and they'll be there their whole lives so I think this election is not just a one-off I think this Alexis gonna be very big for the Democrats so they might just win the Senate it's really gonna be powerful stuff and by the way if you see beta win an 18 you'll probably see him on a ticket in 20 as well okay so I want to ask you this question I've been asking people the past few days Donald Trump was sitting at forty four forty five percent early spring and now he's dropped back down into the 30s I know there are a lot of reasons maybe child separation maybe Helsinki I mean I'm just curious why do you think the president was moving into the territory where he had some of his higher approval ratings since becoming a politician just six months ago and now he's back mired in the 30s well the economics I mean he's battling his only good economic numbers he's got great numbers I mean who wouldn't be bragging about these unemployment rates down well below four and you've got a market that's booming back up there to twenty six hundred so he said you've got 26 tasks you've got great economic numbers it's him and you know especially during this time we're honoring remembering we're marking I guess their work weird nine eleven the great thing about 9/11 and there was one great thing about all that horror in the weeks thereafter you saw a unity in this country we had never felt since maybe World War two a tremendous the yuppies at their sidewalk cafes were cheering the firefighters one went buying their engines the class differences were removed resolved for a while there was a tremendous looking out for the first responders in a way that was wonderful people are looking you know kids when I grow up they want to be nurses they wanted to be firefighters that's what you want to be when you're 5 or 7 years old you naturally have a much of a heroic in stick you want to be a hero to people you want to be the good guy or the good woman and I think that 9/11 brought that instinct of kids out of us you know I spoke at the friendly sons that that that spring and I got all I had to do was talk about the Irish tradition of firefighting in New York City and I just started listing names you know most of the guys that got killed going up those stairs were Irish because of those long generation after generation traditions in New York City of always being a firefighter and of course we had Hispanic guys in african-american people too but there was a tremendous feel about the working class and how important they are in a big city like New York the working class are the ones that save you when you're in trouble they're the cops that come there the emergency workers that are working guys and women who come to save you when you're scared to death they're gonna die and they're the ones that you and then your yuppie and you make a lot of money in your master the universe you forget about those people you look down on them well you can't because in the end they're the ones that save you and I think that was the wonderful thing about 9/11 that afterwards people said you know what they're the good guys I felt that Jeffrey go Jeffrey Goldberg I I'm curious seeing your thoughts on again Donald Trump's fall from 44 45 percent to 35 36 percent I know for a lot of us and I'll just speak for myself in the media it all seems bad I mean there's an outrageous statement every day there's a there's a breaching of a constitutional norm every day so it's tougher for me to figure out why he would be at 44 or 45 percent after charlottesville after retweeting neo-nazi tweets but but something's happened with independents especially any any guess what that may have been over the past six months yeah you know I've thought about this a lot remember when your your kids are little and you you take them to the the circus and the circus is fun for two or three hours would imagine having to sit through the circus for 36 or 48 hours straight right bombarded with the the noise and nonsense of a circus I think people are becoming Anor do the Dramat have the drama and they're becoming tired of the excess drama and I think you know the the show the show is maybe moving past its sell-by date maybe that I mean the core is gonna stay the core but the core seems to shrink a little bit and you know the best thing that Donald Trump obviously could do for Republicans running right now is stop tweeting very strange tweets about the various investigations and about Hillary Clinton and and B to borrow to borrow a term that has that he's employed be a little bit more presidential I think just a little bit of quiet might actually help and that's of course what Gary come was trying to tell him to do really of course as you know most of my political theories go back to Johnny Carson Carson who before said you win in central time sound but also Carson understood he he went into people's bedrooms every night and if he if he was too shrill if he had an edge at some point they would just become exhausted I've seen that with presidents too every president has a sell-by date but will tell you a lot of my friends in Pensacola that still would vote for Donald Trump tomorrow do say they don't want to just don't want to talk about him anymore they're just exhausted by it all i I wonder if Jeffrey's not right that independence perhaps who don't feel an undying loyalty to Donald Trump and republicanism might just say enough No Mas I can't take the madness anymore well there are plenty of Republicans and you know we've talked to a lot of the same people or people you talk to on the street who voted for Donald Trump because he was changing to shake it up because they didn't like Hillary Clinton but if you look in those numbers from the CNN poll that we had yesterday among independents he's lost 33 percent of independents in a month he was in 47 and he's down to 31 so Chris if your theory is true if 10 rats have a wave and they take the house and maybe even the Senate if this is the culture we have right now politically with Donald Trump owning Washington he's got the house he's got the Senate what does Washington look like when he's got an adversarial House or maybe an adversarial Senate well as Richard Nixon discovered in the middle of the night when he won reelection with more most every state he had lost the subpoena power again yeah I think he said that the cult's in the middle of night we lost it again he knew what was coming the subpoena power means that Jerry Nadler can spend months of xix getting ready for something whether it's impeachment or not but it's certainly not going to be pleasant for the president and all those committee chairs in both sides of the hill will have a subpoena power and they're gonna use it you can see what happened in the hearings with bread Cavanaugh with Cory Booker's performance and kamila Harrison's performance they are raring to go and they can't wait to get the subpoena power and gel Amica I think they're gonna play it now doesn't necessarily end up well I mean we saw back in the 80th Congress back after that the Republicans came into power and back in 46 and they blew it because all they did was hold hearings but I think this time it's different I think people want to have some hearings that wants in control and Trump and I and one thing that's really changed the suburbs Joe where I grew up right on the Philadelphia stage those Chester Delaware Montgomery even up in the swing part of the state they're gonna vote for Allentown they are good Lehigh Valley they're gonna vote Democrat for those women candidates all for them I think all for those women win I think the whole structure of the East Coast what happens is I think two months from now people are gonna vote the way we all thought they were going to vote in 16 for Hillary but there'll be no Hillary factor it'll just be you don't like Trump and I think that's the big choice I've got my family was three to two of the brothers three to two Trump this time it's going to be to the three against Trump so I think one of my brother's just switched so and he lives in chess in Bucks County I tell you I think the suburbs are going to vote the way they did they were supposed to vote last time which was anti Trump but that we know Hillary invited to disturb that pattern could be fascinating we shall see we all hold back from
