00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:07,424
â™ª

2
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:10,628
>> IF PEOPLE PAY THEIR FAIR

3
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:12,329
SHARE, IF CORPORATIONS AND

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,864
THE ULTRA WEALTHY, IF WE

5
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:19,236
RATE TO 28%, IF WE DO THOSE

6
00:00:19,237 --> 00:00:20,504
TWO THINGS AND ALSO CLOSE

7
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:22,573
SOME OF THOSE LOOPHOLES,

8
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:23,174
THAT'S $2 TRILLION RIGHT

9
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:23,474
THERE.

10
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:24,775
IF WE IMPLEMENT THE CARBON

11
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:27,678
TAX THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,180
AMOUNT OF THE LARGE AMOUNT

13
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:30,915
OF REVENUE THAT WE CAN HAVE.

14
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,216
AND THEN THE LAST KEY, WHICH

15
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:34,785
IS EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY

16
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:36,921
IMPORTANT IS

17
00:00:36,922 --> 00:00:37,421
REPRIORITYIZATION.

18
00:00:37,422 --> 00:00:38,956
JUST LAST YEAR WE GAVE THE

19
00:00:38,957 --> 00:00:41,425
MILITARY A $700 BILLION

20
00:00:41,426 --> 00:00:42,293
BUDGET INCREASE, WHICH THEY

21
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:45,262
DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR.

22
00:00:45,263 --> 00:00:46,230
PETE: THAT'S THE NEW

23
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:47,264
SOCIALIST DARLING FROM THE

24
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:47,631
BRONX.

25
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:54,271
LET'S BRING IN DAN BONGINO,

26
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,406
FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT

27
00:00:55,407 --> 00:00:57,908
AND HOST OF THE DAN BONGINO

28
00:00:57,909 --> 00:00:58,242
PODCAST.

29
00:00:58,243 --> 00:00:59,176
SHE SEEMS TO BE SPEAKING FOR

30
00:00:59,177 --> 00:01:00,778
A LOT OF THE DEMOCRATS EVEN

31
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:02,546
THOUGH SHE CALLS HERSELF A

32
00:01:02,547 --> 00:01:03,314
DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST.

33
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:04,582
HER IDEAS ARE GUTTING THE

34
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:08,652
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

35
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:10,321
>> YEAH, PETE, SHE IS ALSO

36
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:11,155
SPEAKING FOR PEOPLE WHO

37
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:12,489
DON'T READ BOOKS.

38
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,457
BECAUSE ALMOST NOTHING SHE

39
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,292
SAID IN THAT CLIP WAS

40
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:16,727
FACTUALLY CORRECT.

41
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:18,562
RONALD REAGAN, YES, RONALD

42
00:01:18,563 --> 00:01:19,763
REAGAN ACTUALLY RAISED A

43
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:23,534
REVENUE WENT DOWN.

44
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:25,703
WHEN HE CUT INCOME TAXES

45
00:01:25,704 --> 00:01:26,604
SIGNIFICANTLY, TAX REVENUE

46
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:27,238
WENT UP.

47
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,706
SO WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT

48
00:01:28,707 --> 00:01:30,307
ABOUT RAISING TAXES SHE HAS

49
00:01:30,308 --> 00:01:31,308
VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE GOING

50
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:32,843
TO PRODUCE MORE REVENUE.

51
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:35,246
NUMBER TWO, SHE CONFUSING

52
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:36,614
THE ENTIRE MILITARY BUDGETS,

53
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:37,848
PETE, WITH THE INCREASE.

54
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:39,383
THE ENTIRE MILITARY BUDGET

55
00:01:39,384 --> 00:01:40,851
IS AROUND 700.

56
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:43,387
THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR

57
00:01:43,388 --> 00:01:43,954
$700 BILLION INCREASE.

58
00:01:43,955 --> 00:01:45,856
SHE IS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS.

59
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:46,991
DUPED THIS, RIGHT?

60
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:49,293
NOT ONLY -- BY THE WAY, THE

61
00:01:49,294 --> 00:01:50,861
LIES GO ON OR THE MISTRUTHS

62
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:52,663
OR WHATEVER THE FOCUS GROUP

63
00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:53,831
TESTED WORD IS AND THEN SHE

64
00:01:53,832 --> 00:01:55,432
SAYS AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN

65
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:57,935
ASK FOR IT GENERAL MATTIS

66
00:01:57,936 --> 00:01:59,470
ACTUALLY LOBBIED FOR THE

67
00:01:59,471 --> 00:01:59,837
INCREASE.

68
00:01:59,838 --> 00:02:01,272
DOLLS SHE NOT KNOW THAT DID

69
00:02:01,273 --> 00:02:02,873
SHE JUST MAKE UP THIS WHOLE

70
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:03,173
THING?

71
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:04,408
AT WHAT POINT IS SHE GOING

72
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,743
TO GO ON THE AIR AND SAY

73
00:02:05,744 --> 00:02:07,578
SOMETHING THAT IS FACTUALLY

74
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:07,912
CORRECT?

75
00:02:11,816 --> 00:02:14,218
THIS IS EMBARRASSING NOW.

76
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:16,387
GRIFF: DAN, LET ME JUST TELL

77
00:02:16,388 --> 00:02:17,955
YOU, SHE CLEARLY IS POINTING

78
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:19,123
OUT SOME OF THE WEAKNESSES

79
00:02:19,124 --> 00:02:19,790
OF THE G.O.P.

80
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:20,591
SHE TWEETED THAT THE G.O.P.

81
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:21,859
IS WEAK ON FIGHTING FOR

82
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,893
WORKING CLASS AMERICANS.

83
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:24,828
WEAK ON CRIME, WORK ON EQUAL

84
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:25,262
RIGHTS.

85
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:26,463
WEAK ON NATIONAL SECURITY,

86
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:28,699
WEAK ON REJECTING RACISM,

87
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,267
WEAK ON MORAL COURAGE AND

88
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:34,104
A PROBLEM WITH THE

89
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:34,772
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

90
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:35,205
WHAT SAY YOU?

91
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:36,440
>> YEAH, YEAH.

92
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:38,208
THAT'S JUST A GENIUS TWEET.

93
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:39,143
WEAK ON BORDERS.

94
00:02:39,144 --> 00:02:40,611
WE WANT A BORDER WALL THAT

95
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:42,212
L. WILL DEFINITELY WEAKEN

96
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:42,613
THE BORDER.

97
00:02:42,614 --> 00:02:44,148
WEAK ON FAMILY VALUES.

98
00:02:44,149 --> 00:02:45,316
S THAT FASCINATING.

99
00:02:45,317 --> 00:02:46,483
GRIFF IS, SHE JUST MAKING

100
00:02:48,553 --> 00:02:50,754
SHE MAY NEED AN INTERVENTION

101
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:51,388
AFTER THIS TWEET.

102
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:52,189
THAT IS INSANE.

103
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,357
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN WRITE

104
00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:53,657
THAT?

105
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:54,992
SHE DOESN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND

106
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:58,162
ABOUT FAIR SHARE?

107
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:02,800
TAXES.

108
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:03,867
BIG FEDERAL INCOME TAXES.

109
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:05,235
THINK ABOUT THAT.

110
00:03:05,236 --> 00:03:06,603
ONE OUT OF 100 PEOPLE

111
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:07,771
WORKING THEIR BUTTS OUT

112
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:09,506
THERE IS PAYING 40 CENTS OF

113
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:10,641
EVERY DOLLAR.

114
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:12,676
THE TOP 20% OF EARNERS ARE

115
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,714
ON TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY

116
00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:18,449
SINCE TRUMP IS IN OFFICE AND

117
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,450
I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR

118
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:19,783
THIS.

119
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:21,218
ONE WE ARE NOT APOLOGIZING

120
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:22,286
FOR HARD WORK ANYMORE.

121
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:24,254
NUMBER TWO, WE DON'T OWE A

122
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:25,389
DIME MORE CAPTAIN FEDERAL

123
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:25,789
GOVERNMENT.

124
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,357
NOT A DIME.

125
00:03:30,228 --> 00:03:31,161
FLUSHED OUR SOCIAL SECURITY

126
00:03:31,162 --> 00:03:31,862
DOWN THE TOILET.

127
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:32,730
HAVE YOU RUINED THE

128
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:33,397
EDUCATION SYSTEM.

129
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:35,199
YOU ARE DROWNING US IN

130
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,833
20 TRILLION IN DEBT.

131
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:36,900
WE ARE NOT GIVING YOU ANY

132
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:37,501
MORE MONEY.

133
00:03:37,502 --> 00:03:38,369
DO YOU HEAR WHAT WE ARE

134
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,304
TALKING ABOUT?

135
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:41,238
IN RULES.

136
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,173
NO MOSQUE, NO MORE MONEY FOR

137
00:03:43,174 --> 00:03:43,440
YOU.

138
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:44,441
HAVE YOU RUINED ALL YOUR

139
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:45,376
CREDIBILITY.

140
00:03:45,377 --> 00:03:46,710
IT'S NOT THAT THE GOVERNMENT

141
00:03:46,711 --> 00:03:48,612
IS TOO BIG IT'S TOO DUMB TO

142
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:49,713
SPEND OUR MONEY THE RIGHT

143
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:49,980
WAY.

144
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:50,848
WE WILL KEEP IT NOW THANK

145
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:52,316

146
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:55,252
IS THE FUTURE OF THE PARTY.

147
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:56,553
THEY LOVE THE MESSAGE SHE IS

148
00:03:56,554 --> 00:03:58,222
TALKING WITH A LOT OF YOUNG

149
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:01,558
THAT?

150
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:02,459
THE BIG QUESTION AS WE ALL

151
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,293
ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS

152
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:04,528
MORNING IS WHERE IS THAT

153
00:04:04,529 --> 00:04:05,696
MONEY GOING TO COME FROM?

154
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:07,631
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR

155
00:04:07,632 --> 00:04:07,898
IT?

156
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:08,966
CABOT PHILLIPS WHO IS ON OUR

157
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:09,800
SHOW ALL THE TIME HE GOES

158
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:11,735
OUT AND GETS AN IDEA OF HOW

159
00:04:11,736 --> 00:04:13,270
PEOPLE ARE THINKING IN THIS

160
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:13,604
COUNTRY.

161
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:14,571
HE WENT TO COLLEGE CAMPUSES

162
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:18,776
AND ASKED THEM ABOUT THESE

163
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:19,143
POLICIES.

164
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:25,682
ABOUT HOW GOING TO PAY FOR

165
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:25,983
THIS.

166
00:04:25,984 --> 00:04:27,551
>> HER PLATFORM INCLUDES

167
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:30,821
FREE HEALTHCARE, FREE

168
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:32,189
TUITION, LIVING MINIMUM WAGE

169
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:34,892
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE

170
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:36,226
PROVIDING FOR PEOPLE.

171
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:36,693
>> ABSOLUTELY.

172
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:37,494
>> 100 PERCENT.

173
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:38,429
>> I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE

174
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,563
SHOULD HAVE FREE EDUCATION

175
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:41,698
FOR THOSE?

176
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:42,800
>> OH, GOD.

177
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:44,268
I MEAN,.

178
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:44,868
>> US.

179
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:45,936
>> US, I GUESS.

180
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:47,738
>> WHO, IN YOUR MIND SHOULD

181
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:48,672
PAY FOR ALL OF THE FREE

182
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:54,545
IT.

183
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:55,913
>> BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS

184
00:04:55,914 --> 00:04:56,513
FUNDED BY TAXES.

185
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:01,885
>> THAT LAST ANSWER WAS EPIC

186
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:03,754
BECAUSE IT SUMS UP THE

187
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:04,721
ENTIRE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT.

188
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,123
HOW FAR ARE WE GOING TO PAY

189
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:06,490
FOR IT?

190
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:07,624
BY TAXES BUT THEN THE

191
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,592
GOVERNMENT CAN PAY FOR THE

192
00:05:08,593 --> 00:05:10,160
REST AS IF THE GOVERNMENT

193
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:11,295
HAS LIKE A MONEY FAIRY.

194
00:05:11,296 --> 00:05:12,796
LIKE THERE IS A MONEY FAIRY

195
00:05:12,797 --> 00:05:14,865
THAT SPRINKLES MONEY ALL

196
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:15,199
AROUND.

197
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,300
DO YOU UNDERSTAND LIKE THE

198
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:18,368
BLACK HOLE OF

199
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:19,670
INTELLECTUALISM THE CURRENT

200
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:20,904
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT LIVES

201
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:21,171
IN?

202
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:21,839
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND.

203
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,741
IT REMINDS ME OF A MELTON

204
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,510
FREIDMAN ANALOGY WHERE HE

205
00:05:26,511 --> 00:05:29,213
SAID THE GREAT MYTH OF

206
00:05:29,214 --> 00:05:30,147
PROGRESSIVISM YOU THINK YOUR

207
00:05:30,148 --> 00:05:31,315
NEIGHBOR IS PAYING FOR IT

208
00:05:31,316 --> 00:05:32,549
BUT YOUR NEIGHBOR SAYING THE

209
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,450
SAME THING.

210
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:35,152
THEY THINK YOU ARE PAYING

211
00:05:35,153 --> 00:05:36,320
FOR IT THEY REALLY BELIEVE

212
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:37,421
THERE IS A MONEY FAIRY OUT

213
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:41,658
DOING THE HARD WORK.

214
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:45,729
NICE JOB.

215
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,463
I'M BEING SERIOUS HERE.

216
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:47,764
SHE IS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS.

217
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:48,866
SHE KNOWS VERY LITTLE ABOUT

218
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:49,967
WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT.

219
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:50,934
IF SHE IS GOING TO BE THE

220
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:51,935
FUTURE OF THE PARTY, SHE

221
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,170
OWES THE VOTERS OUT THERE

222
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:55,139
SOME SEMBLANCE OF REALITY,

223
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,441
AND SHE IS NOT LIVING IN IT

224
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,447
THOSE 1 PERCENTERS.

225
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:04,181
>> I'M PROUD.

226
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:05,249
I EARN MY MONEY AND I'M

227
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:10,521
APOLOGIZING ANY MORE.

228
00:06:10,522 --> 00:00:00,000
PETE: GOOD MAN.
