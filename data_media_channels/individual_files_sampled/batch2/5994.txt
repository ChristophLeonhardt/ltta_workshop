Matt Miller there's been testimony on the hill today from Admiral Mike Rogers highly regarded he's stepping down retiring after long service as head of the National Security Agency which is our cyber world and what he testified to today was that no one not the commander in chief not general mattis defense secretary mattis have asked him to retaliate against the known actors now in Russia we've got the indictments we know who these Russians are they don't have to be convicted to know what that special unit was doing right here's part of the testimony and part of his Q&A with Claire McCaskill I'm gonna try to channel a woman who came up to me at the grocery store not too long ago she asked me are we strong enough and smart enough that we can keep them from doing this again yes okay so then the next question she asked me I said the same thing the next question she asked me are we doing that right now we're taking steps but we're probably not doing enough okay so she wants to know and I want to know why the hell not ma'am I'm gonna take I'm an operational commander of am you're asking me a question that's so much bigger than me you could really feel for this NSA director who has done his job but he has not been told to take retaliatory action against Russia for attacking our democracy and that's what Republicans were also asking this when he gets to Russia you've got a bunch of Republican senators on Armed Services who are not happy yeah his testimony today I think was in the category of shocking but not surprising as you revealed we have the ability to deter Russia from doing this again what we don't have is the will and we don't have the will because the will has to come from the president of the United States himself without the president making a decision to retaliate against the Russians and deter the Russians people downstream from him people like the director of the NSA can't take any action as you've reported a number of times on this show there's not yet been a single meeting of the deputies of the the the importantly or the principals of the National Security Agency's turret to formulate a government-wide response and there hasn't been kind of government-wide response because the president for whatever reason will not authorize him to do so will not direct them to do so we we don't know whether that's because he just chafes it the idea that Russia helped get him elected or if it's something more nefarious if they wanted he wants them to help them again but whatever the reason is a dereliction of duty by the president the United States and the end result is you have agencies whose job it is to deter the Russians from doing this again who are frozen and who can't act at Frankfurt Lisi you've watched government you know for decades in the FBI at high levels who is in the position of an FBI director or an NSA director or a CIA director are going to take action if they're not told by the National Security Council led by the president United States to do something our government has a Cyber Command that's the good news they're the agencies talk to each other come and come to work every day under the same roof so that's all coordinated but there's certain categories of action that require the green light from the White House and that's not what's happening there are things we can do people should know even as we're speaking Andrew we're under constant attack by BOTS Russian government sponsored propaganda and Americans are retweeting right now postings and and Twitter feeds that are coming from Russian government sources so can we take them down can we play whack-a-mole and keep knocking them out of cyberspace we can can we send the message that we won't tolerate this we can we can only do that kind of more offensive action if the White House gives the green light and why aren't they doing it is it because they they want Russia to shape the midterm election is it because the president trunk feels compromised and keep take offensive action against Russia what's the what's the reasoning behind this and I want to emphasize that the guy wearing the uniform it's just the the witness here he's not in charge he's in charge of the Cyber Command and doing something but he has to get an order from you know the commander-in-chief thank you very much Frank for greezy and Matt Miller
