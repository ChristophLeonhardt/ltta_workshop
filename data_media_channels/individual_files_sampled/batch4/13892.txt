so with that I want to end this a little bit early and bring on my brand-new cultural correspondent we've been looking around since I started this show it's very important to me that we give the next generation a chance to come up and teach old fogies like me something that you know maybe I don't know about the culture so let's bring them on we have our new Michael Nolt show cultural correspondent Andy Andy millennial thanks for coming on yo Andy as a millennial what is your take on our culture broadly right now well speaking is a millennial and I have to speak as a little millennial because I've never read a book and I haven't seen a movie that was made before 2007 so when I say speaking as a millennial that's actually the only thing I can bring to this conversation of my millennial miss you know my Mallette my essential millennial miss my millennialism you might say and and as a millennial I think I can speak for all Millennials and can tell you the kind of world in which we Millennials live and so that's why I reference that whenever I say anything whatsoever and you know I think as a millennial I feel that the culture is in serious trouble you know we have these new things that were you know rock and roll music I think is making people you know immoral we have our new cult rockers bunny Andrew Clavin famed novelist and dealer wire show host I I did almost break on the I am a millennial and so because I haven't read a book you know remember on election night you played poker with a perfectly straight face asks me senator Warren do you when you look at mr. Trump do you ever feel your fingers itch in for the tomahawk the pinnacle of my deadpan you know that big blonde wig and Milenio thank you for coming on a pleasure we have to sorry what you were doing in here my god these young locks himself in a room thank you sir so we have to talk about one of our favorite subjects yes feminism that we have you talk about this wonderfully feminist response to Milania yeah and you know one of our favorite websites and I will take credit for you for introducing this is everyday feminism calm yeah a true work of art I'm not convinced it's not satire what why has feminism become such a force well I think just about everything I mean first of all this thing with eat with stiletto heels was unbelievable there's Trump hatred you know it's wonderful is all these people in Texas are obviously rising to this level of nobility and grandeur and heroism and they're all the people that the media hates making themselves look so bad you know I think the left is the same thing over and over again they decide that there's an injustice and then they adopt the values of the oppressor or the person they think of is the oppressor so they think that men have oppressed women which by the way in the West completely untrue right I mean that's the first thing I mean the thing is in a society that's just starting out and this week women have a very special role to play which is the role of burying children and you have to protect them and you have to keep them out away from the wars and things like that we're so safe now that a lot of that stuff is gone by the boards but that's only because in the modern world we're so safe so they decide there's this injustice and then they say well we want to be you what the oppressor is so if men are making money why can't women make money if men work why shouldn't women work if if men are strong why shouldn't women you know it's men are dying younger why shouldn't women die who and which now they do there and it's so dumb because essentially men and women are the only kinds of people who are different you don't really believe that black people and white people are different per se you know I'm its culture and there's a lot of effects but you know but men and women are actually different they actually have different strengths different qualities different things that make the men that than women and sure there's always a bell curve you know there's always different people have fallen right not not all manner as macho as you and I are more a fan of course you know I'd say you can't expect that kind of level very top of the mantra though but but you know I think this whole idea that we should value women and conservatives fall for - they'll say you know you want to see feminism how about a woman with a gun and I think you want to see feminism how about woman with a baby it's probably scarier - probably more intimidating exactly you know how about a woman who's nurturing how about a woman who's tender how about a woman who doesn't care as much about money because she's doing something more important you know they even have these things where they'll say if you paid a housewife for everything she did it would cost millions actually if you paid a housewife for the actual physical labor she did wouldn't cost very much at all what she's devoting to it creating a home and creating a moral universe and creating a family that's invaluable you can making the man's sane and you know I think in a man of man you know yeah that's right you know sweet little lease has been gone now for a couple weeks visiting your family I know my life is in shambles my apartment is just not sure Michael we had a great time shooting that's all I do is I go shooting and drinking that's pretty much all I've been up to my wife leaves town about two days later I'm out in the woods I'm in deer it's my teeth no I'm just running down dear yeah no I mean I think that is and they say well why should why should a woman only have value in what she does for a man anything well we all have value and what we do for one another as writers you know so it's just it's just a an absolutely materialist greedy that has adopted the values of the people the supposed values of the people they hate you know you see it with like an Tifa right and Tifa they say that the fascists for the oppressors and so they become fascist yeah that's right they literally wear black shirts you know yeah do you think this has always been inherent in feminism it with you know this indiscernible 'ti of the sexes the sexes women should just be men the sexes should be the same they can't complement one another has that always been in first way of second wave feminism or is it is it blossoming now as its new I think it's a question of revolution eating its own children I have a theory that a lot of these changes come at the time that they're supposed to come you know that that when women when this the civilization gets established women start asking for more rights because they're let there in a way they're less valuable as women children become less valuable so women become less valuable as the bearers of children and so they want more things to do to give them value I think that feminists attach themselves to those changes I was there you know as a millennial I was there when some of this stuff was getting started and it was pretty easy you know women said we want to get in we want to work we want to do these things neighbors thought that's fair that's that's pretty fair but the feminists the radical feminists attached themselves to that right and then essentially accuse you if you oppose feminism and I am an anti-feminist I'm I'm not like a you know sort of pro feminist I'm an anti-feminist but they accused you thinking that women shouldn't have choices and rights I believe a woman should choose whatever she wants to do each one is an individual I believe in it I'm an individualist whenever the circle of feminism and the circle of individualism intersect I'm a FEMINIST aniseh poll the nurse lucky you're gonna find that but as we see with Melania Trump they're not really offering freedom what they're really offering is another way of a prep you wanna do is turn the oppression on us they want to say well women were oppressed now men will be oppressed you know that's not that's no way to build a society I think the changes that came for women the giving them more you know choices and things like that are great but I really think this wave of feminism has accomplished nothing but bad and has attached itself to those good changes and sort of said we did that when they just didn't yeah it seems this third wave seems destructive in a in both a practical sense but also in a theoretical sense that seems as post-structuralist it a lot of these theorists they use lowercase letters to to write their name so it is it's attached to an intellectual movement that deconstructs culture and you know I think it was Chesterton wrote that feminists posit something to the effect of feminists posit that when a woman serves her boss that's freedom and woman helps her husband to that slave I always say that I didn't know chasers and said they basically say to you don't serve a man who loves you and will dedicate his life to you and will help you raise your children I'll help you support dedicated to a guy who would back over you and not even notice you were dead you know I mean that's it makes absolutely no sense and it really you know it's it's something very important because the entire human perception of the world is divided into yin and yang but the simple reason that there are men and women you know I mean they always want to say well men and women are exactly the same but a transgender guy is a man with a woman inside you say well wait how does he know the same how does you know he's a man with a woman he's just a dolt is a double man what's the diff you know so they're they're really taking something very essential to the human perception of the world and damaging it making people afraid to acknowledge it and trying to bully people out of acknowledging it I think it has made speaking as a millennial I think it has made millennial dating a nightmare I think it's made millennial marriage a nightmare I think people don't know it oh and you know what else it's done it's ruined two movies like you can't go to a movie and see the girl get rescued anymore because she's supposed to be so strong and it's boring not to see the girl get rescued most women have that fantasy approach and every man wants to rescue a woman that's all we want to do that's all we do that is all that is true I speaking as a millennial as well I I you have noticed that that you know I mean I haven't dated in about a hundred thousand years at this point but you don't you don't ask women on dates it's all this kind of hanging out it's the way that you would talk to a buddy sex is easier which is cool I mean that's great guys yeah absolutely but it is destructive and you know your novels yeah don't present a feminist vision of the world because I don't believe it's true I mean I you know I will present women who are tough for manly or masculine or stuff like that but I will not write women the way feminists write women because I've never met a woman who resembled anything like those women I mean you know I've met women who were very tough I've met women who are very manly you know masculine but there's still not there's still women at some level and I just really don't write feminism because it doesn't exist it doesn't exist as an actual real thing it just doesn't ring true it represents a vision of the world that none of us in our experience yeah believes to be true even the people who are propagating it probably that's right well of course that's why they you know that's why you get these things where they say like I was so upset that he said you know women aren't the same as men that I I almost fainted you know what you know when he called me emotional I almost burst into tears it's just it doesn't make any sense in it and you know college professors can afford to lie but novelists already fiction they have to tell that's right yeah speaking of your stories that don't present a feminist view of the world I'll say we've got one that we're working on around the clock in this broom closet of a studio in this very room we are creating the cure for the Clavin this weekend another kingdom you were on which by the way and this is the only nice thing I will ever say to you ever you were doing an excellent job you are the performer of this story that I wrote and you I'm watching you act it out and do the voices and all this stuff and it's really actually you almost have some talent did we get that on tape put that on my IMDB or something first thank you very much I mean even I'm listening to it going hey this is pretty under day it is it is a great story it's all really great it does ring a little true to me because it's a bad this failed Hollywood guy he wanders into a kingdom that is probably less surreal than Sepulveda Boulevard that walked off of the studios but it's gonna be rough and we're releasing it actually don't know exactly when we're releasing its it's gonna be shortly after Labor Day and we're gonna bring it out on Fridays to make up for the you because you don't have a show on Friday I don't have a show Friday either our desperate fans will and hopefully they'll stave off some of these disasters yeah the world the world needs something to fill that yeah that's right absolutely so we'll try we'll release it hopefully a little after Labor Day it'll be a weekend release we'll do like one Episode a week and people can write in and send all their angry comments excellent well Andy Andy millennial thank you for being here it's a pleasure to have this great new cultural correspondent Andy millennial everybody thank you very much
