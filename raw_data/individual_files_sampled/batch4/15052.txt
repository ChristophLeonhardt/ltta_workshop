think for a moment about Patrick Brown just for a moment I have very little time for Patrick Brown he's not conservative in any way that counts he totally supports a carbon tax he totally supports a provincial version of m103 the anti Islamophobia censorship motion the Trudeau passed federally Brown actually whipped his MP pieces supported provincially Brown is awful on policy and it's gotten personal with us here the rebel to joining us publicly which I think says more about where he is on the political spectrum than it says about us but still even though I'm glad he's not the leader and I'm glad all three of these candidates that are I don't know what the fourth one who are seeking to replace him or against the carbon tax for example I still think it was fishy why Brown was kicked out in that manner Brown surfaced again a few days ago in the Toronto Sun with a detailed rebuttal to the CTV accusations against him though certainly didn't get the same wide coverage as the original accusations here let me read from that story the headline is absolute lies Patrick Brown refutes sex misconduct allegations now I'm not going to read a ton of it it was very long story but let me give you just one example of the kind of details in his refutation okay I'm quoting from the Sun here the first anonymous complainant told CTV she and a friend met Brown at a bar while she was a student at a berry high school she alleged Brown invited them back to his home where he gave her alcohol once they're brown allegedly took the high-school student on a tour that ended up with the teen in his second-floor upstairs bedroom okay so here's Browns reply in the sense that was the allegation on CTV let me read Brown's reply on the son now I'm going to go for a full minute here and you'll see the detail and you'll understand why I'm gonna go for a full minute ready I remember her being a girl in Barry Brown said but otherwise doesn't know her or recall meeting her nor could the incident have happened as described he said because he lived in a ground-floor apartment when the teen was in high school I did the math in 2007 I didn't live in the home where I had a second-floor bedroom he said it's just factually impossible for that to have happened brown in fact lived in a duplex at 138 Collier speed embarr a tiny one-bedroom ground-floor apartment in a two-story house with a bedroom that didn't have a door the other side of the duplex was his legal office and a separate apartment upstairs was rented out to someone else Brown presented Postmedia with affidavits from former staff attesting to the configuration of the building and a Barry real estate professional involved with the property at that time confirmed Brown lived in the downstairs apartment I'm almost done the complainant now 29 in early 2017 would have graduated from high school and did and did according to yearbook records okay I'm done quoting but that's a pretty specific rebuttal isn't that and it's checkable it's provable true or false isn't that did he or didn't he live in a two-story house did the girl in question well was she still in high school or not those are the kind of questions that a skeptical reporter or editor might have put to an anonymous accuser before going on national TV but then again it wasn't really a skeptical reporter was it the reporter was a personal friend of the accused if the name of the accuser had been made public maybe other people could have made inquiries but they couldn't write because it was a secret accusation that's pretty fishy don't you think that's an excerpt for my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
