my name is Johnny Harris and I make
videos here at Vox for the past six
months I've been traveling around to
faraway places to tell the story of
borders I traveled to six different
border lands around the globe to tell
the story of what happens when you draw
lines on a map and I'm finally ready to
share these stories with you on October
17th I'm gonna publish the first episode
and I'll be publishing the weekly
thereafter I've been through a river
right now
borders are strange and interesting
places and each one has a unique human
story surrounding it that was my goal
was to try to capture these stories and
to tell them through these short
documentaries so I hope you'll tune in
October 17
