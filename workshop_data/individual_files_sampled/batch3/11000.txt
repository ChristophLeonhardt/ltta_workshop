now the US ambassador to the United Nations has accused North Korea of pushing the world closer to war with its latest ballistic missile tests nikki Haley was speaking at an emergency Security Council summit the dictator of North Korea made a choice yesterday that brings the world closer to war not farther from it if war does come it will be because of continued acts of aggression like we witnessed yesterday and if war comes make no mistake the North Korean regime will be utterly destroyed I'm joined live in the studio by Samira Khan for more on this thanks for staying abreast of this Sameera rhetoric certainly not decreasing in the Security Council there what could we take away from this meeting well the emergency meeting was held specifically to discuss North Korea's latest missile test in which they launched a successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that's capable of carrying nuclear weapons and some believe could reach Washington but nikki Haley echoed these concerns and even asked the international community to follow suit she first called to essentially revoke North Korea's voting rights at the UN but we're just paraphrasing here her exact words were a little bit different of the council provisional rules first we should continue to treat North Korea as the international pariah it has become by taking its UN rights and privileges away including its voting powers now nikki Haley also urged all countries to cut off all ties with the DPRK and these include diplomatic scientific and trade ties in order to quote reverse the crisis but let's take a listen we call on all nations to cut off all ties with North Korea in addition to fully implementing all UN sanctions all countries should sever diplomatic relations with North Korea and limit military scientific technical or commercial cooperation now in contrast to the US Russia urged against increasing tensions and actually called for political dialogue and multilateralism so is difficult to move towards any settlement as long as North Korea feels that is security is threatened in the current situation the urgently call in all parties involved to stop escalating the tensions that accompany each new cycle of reactions and response measures we all need to pause and think carefully about the consequences of such steps as of now we're just waiting for North Korea's response but until we get that the situation remains relatively unclear all right Samira Carla were the latest updates from the UN Security Council Thanks further
