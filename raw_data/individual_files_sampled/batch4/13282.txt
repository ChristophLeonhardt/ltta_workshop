feminists are calling for women to go on a sex strike March 8th to protest Donald Trump and you know what that means that's right women who support Donald Trump are going to be getting a lot of action I mean a lot of action Hausa if you're a trump supporting woman on March 8th you are gonna be busy sorry my mind drifted what was I talking about oh yeah feminists want women to go on a sex strike to protest Donald Trump as a first step to organizing the strike feminists say they will have to locate women who have sex with men or at least women that men want have sex with and as none of these are feminists the task may be a large one the idea of the strike was put forward in an article titled women of America we're going on strike join us so Trump will see our power the article was published in The Guardian a British Communist newspaper that I guess some of these horrible communist type people read in the piece a group of feminists right and this is a real quote the idea is to mobilize women including trans women in an international day of struggle a day of striking marching blocking roads bridges and squares abstaining from domestic care and sex work unquote in other words if I'm reading that right when March 8th comes you could find a transsexual prostitute standing in traffic to protest violence against women try not to run him over that would probably set the cause back by being an act of violence against someone who looks like a woman even though he's really not the article goes on to attack what is now being called lean in feminism lean in feminism is the idea that rich white women can have anything they want if they're irritating enough and their husbands are weaklings but according to the horrible communist women in The Guardian lean in feminism is very bad because it's only for rich white women and you know what they're like especially when they get some kind of stupid idea like lean and feminism and they won't stop going on and on about it so the Communists Horrible's in The Guardian want transsexual prostitutes to block traffic in order to prove they can be just as annoying as rich white women and good luck with that now you may say what's any of this got to do with Donald Trump after all he's off safely in the White House where he can't go around grabbing women by the crotch anymore unless he starts acting like Bill Clinton in which case watch out but I mean as long as he continues to behave like a Republican president women should be relatively safe and there would be no reason for transsexual prostitutes to block traffic which Donald Trump probably won't care that much about anyway so really when you think about it this whole idea doesn't make much sense but it's from women you know what they're like they're totally irrational trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show right the Clavin last weekend at last is over we're back we have Grammy winning cultural correspondent Michael Knowles

certain June sequa which i think is French for criminal incompetence alright I don't know we been and I just gotten in our and backstage a friendly argument backstage about Stephen Miller I watched Stephen Miller the spokes from the White House policy aide on TV I thought it was a bloodbath I thought the police should be investigating who killed the morning talk show host look why he just cut them to pieces I thought it was like watching the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was like don't stop you're killing Chuck dog you know we'll get back to him first we have to talk about you know I gave this speech over the weekend in Colorado and people were complaining that I didn't tell them where I was and I don't really give a lot of speeches and when I do I kind of do it in this days I usually agree to it because I wasn't thinking clearly and then I go off and I kind of ignore the fact that I have to do it until I'm there and all that so I don't really promote them as well as I should I should probably talk a little bit more this was with with the leadership program of the Rockies excellent organization where they actually train conservative libertarians to you know enter government and they've stocked a lot of Colorado's government a lot of the people who are still fighting for freedom in Colorado come from this this program and I was talking about what I call and with the left often calls the narrative the way our ideas are shaped by the story that we're told about as Barack Obama say who we are who we are and I just feel and one of the things I said at this place was that I felt that Donald Trump is the first president on our side since Reagan to understand the narrative and when he attacks Saturday Night Live and people like me you're going like why is the president attacking Saturday Night Live he actually knows what he's doing and the difference you know people will say oh well look Reagan was so polite and so optimistic and he knew how to speak to people in this gentle grandfatherly way and Trump is such a bore and he's so rough and he's a roughneck they both are products of the culture that created them I mean our prot our culture has become vulgarized since reagan to produce language like trumps and i think that when the people are out there protesting to him are the people who created the culture because the culture is a wholly owned subsidiary of the left wing of the country and that's kind of what I was talking about and why I take hope when Trump's people go out there and change the narrative when they attack the press for being the corrupt dishonest people that they are I mean right now they're they're trying to do a couple of things in the press one is to create this atmosphere of chaos in the White House and I I don't know I mean this Trump White House has been pretty disciplined the people they pick are really amazing but you know there's the story now about Mike Flynn I pardon me the national security advisor before he took office before he took office he talked to the Russian ambassador and discussed the sanctions that Obama had imposed on them for theoretically tampering with the election and then he said that he didn't and Mike Pence went on TV and said well he didn't he says that he didn't some dancer is reportedly ticked off about this and they're thinking about would should they get rid of Flynn and of course this is reported in the New York Times which used to be a newspaper you may have heard of it turmoil from the top down at the National Security Council you know I can I stepped out of line there a little out of practice you know these guys are not this is not a politically experienced group of people and they're gonna make some mistakes maybe this big deal about Kellyanne Conway you know she broke a rule it's true she broke a rule by touting Ivanka Trump stuff you know but like who cares I mean really who can you know yeah tell her not to do that anymore but who cares the other meme know that I've just notices they're sending out is that Trump is crazy that he's mentally disturbed okay now this was interesting because I was talking about Trump at the in in Colorado and afterwards a woman came up to me and said you know really loved your speech but the one thing I disagree with you was about is Trump because I think he's crazy you know and I said well you mean literally think he's crazy and she said yes and I said well look you know he's so he's so new and offbeat that you may be right you may be right but things there's little things that kind of tend to testify against that like his success in businesses success on TVs success in the campaigns and the fact that his children don't seem to me to be emotional wrecks they seem all of them to be very poised and put together and if your father is crazy so I can tell you you don't really turn out like that but the way they push this I just want to talk about how the narrative these narratives have created what they do first is they put it on entertainment shows they make jokes about it and that and they'll put up posters on the street my friend Owen brennon over in madison mcqueen talks about this a little bit that those create the borders that yeah the borders of what we're allowed to say seriously so take a look at Bill Maher who is talking to comedian Al Franken who had now I guess we have to call elected comedian Al Franken and and and and Maher says to him you know you sit around and you have private lunches with Republicans what are these Republicans telling you about Donald Trump and here is frankenz response to give us a little insight into what's happening behind the scenes well there's a range and what he'll say and some will say that he's not right mentally and some are harsher that's not fair that was a cheap that was cheap there are some who I guess don't talk to me you know I haven't heard a lot of good things and I've heard some great concern about about the president's temperament okay so you know now we have to let Franken off the hook it's not like he's a senator easy as a comedian oh wait wait he is it no but this is the way they established the borders of what is it appropriate to say he's calling the president crazy he's saying the President of the United States is insane so now brian Stelter this reliable anti-trump crusader on CNN who actually thinks he's reporting he actually thinks he's telling the whole story he has Andrew Sullivan does anybody remember Andrew Sullivan Andrew Sullivan had this big blog and the thing was he was he was supposed to be a gay conservative and only that's only half true I mean he is gay but he's not a conservative and brian Stelter and he's selling the same thing to brian Stelter he wrote an article saying that Trump was unbalanced and he you know he talked about the murder rate and the murder rate wasn't what he said it was and he's obviously a congenital liar and he is mentally unbalanced insulters question is gee why isn't everybody reporting this that's that's big news that the president's crazy so listen to this but you're taking a couple steps further by questioning his mental stability and I wonder why you think that's not being said more often on television or in columns like your own do you feel like you're a bit alone on this issue and if so why well I think elbows are picking up but certainly if you are not on camera or not writing people are talking about this all the time I think sometimes you want to assume that there is a rationality at the center of our entire republic that there is someone who can listen to reason who can see an empirical fact who can distinguish between an opinion and a fact between what he wants to be true and what is true and and sometimes we don't want to say that in public we can't but look we're journalists and we're trying to understand what's happening and if we don't just simply say what's in front of our eyes what youth are we yes what used to weed now this is the guy Andrew Sullivan who when Sarah Palin had her baby trig this guy went nuts trying to prove that trig Palin was not Sarah's son but was her daughter's son and she was actually the grandmother and they were covering up this illegitimate child he went full bore 100% to the wall out of his mind trying to prove us with charts and you know they made fun of him that he was doing a chart of like a womb and how this worked listen to him with the joy behar giving this conspiracy theory there are so many bizarre questions including his extraordinary story of the birth of trig witches on any on any basis extraordinarily hard to believe the way she's told it may be there is some truth there that we don't fully know the way she's told it you just don't behave that way no one behaves that which way no one has no one is 8 months pregnant thousands of miles away from home as she says in a hotel room in Dallas oh yes with a special-needs child wakes up both upright in bed has a strange sensation low in her belly and tells the Anchorage Daily News that her water broke and doesn't go to the hospital no one does that oh that's a very interesting no one let alone then give a speech in her own book she says she gives a speech while she's having contractions I said it tells a joke in the speech she says big laughs more contractions there's no one investigating this getting a pass on a lot of things the mainstream media didn't do any investigations the plausibility of this story it's known investor she's getting a pass on having by the way salon credit where credit is due so thoroughly debunked this conspiracy theory I mean everybody had seen that she was pregnant everybody knew she was pregnant everybody knew when she delivered I mean the whole thing was absolutely invented out of whole from this man sick imagination this is crazy stuff and now he's doing it again with Donald Trump so now it's moved up to brian Stelter so what used to be Entertainment Joy Behar it's kind of nonsense show that she did you know now becomes the news and that is the way they push this to the max and the final response to this we will give you in a minute I'm gonna have to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but Grammy women winning cultural correspondent Michael Knowles is coming up to sing his entire report on the Grammys at the daily wire.com papa getting her voice
