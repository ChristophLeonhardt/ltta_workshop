let's put this into perspective we're seeing reports that there are 8000 direct jobs that are going to be lost by the fact that TMX won't get expanded but to put it in perspective historical perspective so that people truly truly understand just how catastrophic this is during the national energy program one of the darkest most horrible times in Alberta history we lost 15,000 jobs in total and that's you know those numbers are from caps so we lost more than half of that in this one project cancellation that is the statistic that truly puts this this into real perspective so people can see this one project is worth more than half of all the damage done by the National Energy Program and how worse is it gonna get yeah if we don't get our oil to market I mean the United I don't understand what this concept is I don't know why we're in this position I don't know why the Vancouver mayor and the premier and all these people don't get it um the United States slowly but surely doesn't need our oil and we're selling it to them at a discount and in that time frame that we sat here and fought over pipelines they became the world's biggest producer of oil they build enough pipelines to go around the earth twice and started shipping oil everywhere and we're sitting here with the third largest proven oil reserve in the world we're not doing anything we in fight we pretend things matter that don't matter we allow a bunch of hasting rejects to take to camp outside and Burnaby Mountain for eight months before we actually kick them out watch the videos now they're all back on Hastings like I'm not making this up they actually are posting videos Rene seems they're all broke they're basking for money I mean I mean let's you know lately got that that has been holding out maybe not totally but holding up our prosperity 8,000 people loser and there's more news about a bunch of homeless drug addicts on Hastings who got kicked out of camp loud at Burnaby Nam and they're back on Hastings I mean I've never I don't know what we have the greatest country in the world we have prosperity we have freedom of speech even in Halifax sort of yeah we don't we're not we're not embracing the good things that we have I'm terrified I I'm blown away there was just against its I'm just worried because I don't believe that I don't think Justin Trudeau knows what he's doing that's an excerpt from my weekly full-length show the gun show on my show I take on the issues of the day through my Alberta conservative lens and I talked to the real news makers the mainstream media ignores to get access to my show in all of our other premium content click the link on the screen to subscribe today you
