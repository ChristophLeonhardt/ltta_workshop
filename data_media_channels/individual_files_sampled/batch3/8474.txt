FRONT LINES. BUT FIRST, ROSANNE AND THE RACE TO BLAME TRUMP. THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S ANGLE. WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT, WE SOLVED A TWITTER MYSTERY. WELL DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF MAY HAVE WELL TAKEN POSSESSION OF ROSEANNE BARR'S ACCOUNT AND IT TAPPED OUT THE TWEET THAT LED TO THE DEMISE OF HER HIT SITCOM AND HER ENTIRE CAREER. LISTEN CLOSELY. ALL ROADS LEAD BACK TO TRUMP. WE KNOW WHAT DONALD TRUMP THINKS. WE KNOW WHAT ROSEANNE BARR THINKS. IT'S TIME FOR US TO STOP PLAYING AROUND WITH SOFT WORDS, BY SAYING OH, WELL, THEY ARE SAYING INSENSITIVE THINGS. NO, IT'S RACIST. THEY ARE EXHIBITING RACIST BEHAVIOR. I'M NOT SOMEONE WHO HAS TRUMPS ARRANGEMENT SYNDROME AND BLAMES DONALD TRUMP FOR EVERYTHING BUT, THIS RIGHT HERE IS A DIRECT BYPRODUCT OF HOW DONALD TRUMP BEHAVES. THE THING THAT A SORT OF THE BACKGROUND OF ALL OF THIS IS THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN BE RACIST, AND NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM. Laura: SO NOW THEY DO BELIEVE IN GUILT BY ASSOCIATION. WELL, THEY DIDN'T SUBSCRIBE TO THIS BELIEF WHEN THIS HAPPENED. NO NO NO. GOD BLESS AMERICA. AMERICA. THAT'S IN THE BIBLE FOR KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE. Laura: EVEN THOUGH PRESIDENT OBAMA SAT IN JEREMIAH WRIGHT'S P WAS YEARS MARINATING IN THAT HATE, WE WERE TOLD THAT HIS COMMENTS WERE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF OBAMA'S OWN BELIEFS. THIS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT, UNLIKE TRUMP AND ROSEANNE, THE OBAMA'S WERE CLOSE TO RIGHT. HE WAS THE PRESIDENT'S SPIRITUAL MENTOR FOR YEARS. AND WHO CAN FORGET THIS 2005 JIM WHICH WAS CONVENIENTLY HIDDEN FROM PUBLIC VIEW BY THE PHOTOGRAPHER FOR YEARS. THAT'S A BUTTE. WELL, WE NEVER SAW THAT PICK UNTIL OBAMA LEFT OFFICE. YOU SEE THE LEFT PROTECTS AND DEFENDS THEIR OWN BECAUSE THEY ARE IMMUNE TO CRITICIZE THEM FOR THEIR UNSAVORY POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS. BUT THE PRESIDENT CALLS AN ACTRESS AND CONGRATULATES HER FOR HER RATINGS SUCCESS, AND SUDDENLY HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING SHE HAS EVER DONE OR WILL DO. WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT STARTED HIS CAREER ON THE BREATH TERRORISM, SAYING HE ISN'T ONE OF US, WHEN HE'S DONE EVERYTHING HE CAN TO DO DOG WHISTLING AROUND THIS ISSUE OF RACE, PEOPLE LIKE ROSEANNE FEEL THEY ARE EMPOWERED. Laura: WHAT A FRAUD. THIS IS THE MAN WHO BROUGHT US THE FAKE TAWANA BRAWLEY CASE. AND THAT WAS WHEN HE WASN'T EVADING TAXES OR SHAKING DOWN CORPORATIONS. AND THIS IS WHO MSNBC WHEELS OUT ON AS AN EXPERT. SHARPTON ON BIGOTRY AND CIVILITY IN AMERICA? PLEASE. THE LEFT HAS TO TAG IT ROSEANNE'S RACIAL MISDEED TO TRUMP, WHY? BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO SUBSTANTIVE ANSWERS TO THE PROBLEMS FACING MINORITY COMMUNITIES TODAY. THEIR ONLY RECOURSE IS TO DO THIS TO DEMONIZE THEIR OPPONENTS. MEANWHILE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ACTUALLY DELIVERING UNDENIABLE RESULTS. WE KNOW UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG BLACKS AND HISPANICS IS DOWN TO HISTORICAL LOWS. WE KNOW THEY ARE TRYING TO READ THEIR COMMUNITIES OF GANGS LIKE MS-13, AND THE PRESIDENT IS WORKING WITH CONGRESS TO PASS PRISON REFORM. ALL OF THIS HAS CAUSE TO SUPPORT, AND GROW AMONG MINORITY GROUPS, MODEST GAINS. BUT THE LAST OF COURSE REFUSES TO APPLAUD ANY OF TRUMPS PROGRESS OR WORK WITH HIM, EVEN ON ISSUES WHERE THEY HAVE COMMON GROUND. THAT IS HOW FANATICAL THEY ARE. INSTEAD, WHAT THE LEFT DOES IS THEY PLOT A WAY ON HOW TO EXPLOIT THE NEXT MOMENT OF RACIAL OUTRAGE. HERE IS HOW HOOVER INSTITUTIONS FELLOW AND PHENOMENAL AUTHOR SHELBY STEELE WHO ACTUALLY LIVED THROUGH SEGREGATION IN THE SOUTH, HOW HE SEES IT FROM TODAY ON THE RADIO SHOW. IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT THE AMOUNT OF CREATIVITY AND IMAGINATION THAT GOES INTO SOME REINVENTING RACISM, VIRTUALIZATION IS POWER, AND IF THE MONEY. THIS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE PURSUING A RACE-FREE WORLD, A WORLD FREE OF RACISM. BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE PURSUING WEALTH. THEY ARE RACIAL ENTREPRENEURS. THEY MAKE CAREERS OUT OF THIS. THE WHITE MIDDLE CLASS TODAY IS SADLY SUPPORTED BY DIVERSITY WORK AND PROGRAMS. Laura: AGAIN, THAT'S FROM AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN WHO LIVED THROUGH REAL RACISM, SUFFERED THROUGH SEGREGATION. HIS COMMENTS? WELL, PEOPLE OF COURSE READ IT ROSEANN'S TWEET AS TOTALLY BIASED. SHE HERSELF SAYS IT'S INDEFENSIBLE. BUT THERE OTHER FORMS OF BIAS THAT MALIGNING GOOD AND HARDWORKING AMERICANS EVERY DAY. REMEMBER THE WOMEN WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP? IN LIGHT OF THIS LAST ELECTION, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT US AS WOMEN, AND HOW WE THINK. WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH OURSELVES AS WOMEN. THIS IS NOT AN EXTERNAL CONVERSATION, THAT'S ON US. Laura: THEN THEY HAVE COMMENTS LIKE, FROM HER TELL US WHAT TO DO. REALLY? A BLACK RAPPER WHO SUPPORTS TRUMP. CELEBRITIES LOOKING FOR ATTENTION AND FINDING WAYS WHETHER IT'S POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE TO GET IT. WIFE IS TWEETING BACK AND FORTH THAT PEOPLE BASICALLY SAYING DON'T BE TOO HARD ON MY HUSBAND TO COME UP DON'T MAKE IT SEEM LIKE IT'S GOING THROUGH SOME KIND OF MENTAL BREAKDOWN. AND WE THINK THAT HE HAS LOST HIS MIND. TRADITIONAL CHRISTIANS. ONE THING TO TALK TO JESUS, AND IT'S ANOTHER THING WHEN JESUS TALKS TO GO. Laura: EXACTLY. THAT'S CALLED MENTAL ILLNESS IF I'M NOT CORRECT. Laura: WE ARE BASICALLY TALKING PRETTY MUCH ABOUT ANY AND ALL TRUMP SUPPORTERS. YOU COULD PUT HALF OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS INTO WHAT I CALL THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLE'S. Laura: WELL THINK ABOUT IT THIS OTHER WAY. IF TRUMP CREATED A SAFE SPACE FOR ROSEANN TO WRITE THIS INFLAMMATORY TWEET, MAYBE WITH THAT DEPLORABLE'S COMMENT, HILLARY CLINTON INSPIRED THIS. TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE VOTED FOR HIM, AFTER HE SHOWED HIS CARDS, FOR YEARS. AND ARE YOU SAYING THEY WERE RACIST? YES. Laura: WHILE THEY ARE DEPLORABLE AFTER ALL. ROSEANN HAS NOW BEEN EXCOMMUNICATED FROM THE PUBLIC SQUARE FOR COMMENTS THAT ABC RIGHTFULLY CHARACTERIZED AS ABHORRENT, REPUGNANT AND INCONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES. MY QUESTION IS, WHEN WILL THE DAY OF RECKONING COME FOR THOSE ON THE LEFT, WHOSE OWN ABHORRENT AND REPUGNANT VIEWS ARE
