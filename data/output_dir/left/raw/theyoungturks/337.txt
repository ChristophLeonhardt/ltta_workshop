<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so he is responding to the</font>

allegations<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the first accuser dr.</font>

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,220
specific allegations there were things

60
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,530
that were murky things that she didn't

61
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,120
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember including the</font>

62
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,850
exact address of where the party took

63
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">place and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where the alleged assault took</font>

64
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,650
place and it's strange that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knows the</font>

65
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,960
exact address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that he's reciting it</font>

66
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,940
there in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interview</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know why</font>

67
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,340
he did that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I don't that was super</font>

68
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,240
weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I wouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember the address</font>

69
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a party I wasn't that I I wouldn't</font>

70
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember the address of a party I was at</font>

71
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">why now if it was 35 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago so I</font>

72
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,370
don't know why they thought that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

73
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,550
good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> to specify the address of the</font>

74
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,290
party<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he claims he never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went to</font>

75
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely bizarre and I don't</font>

76
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it helped his case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all it did</font>

77
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,760
the reverse<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean obviously we neither</font>

78
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,790
one of us know why he did that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

79
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,620
only assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he's probably exhausted</font>

80
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now because everything in the</font>

81
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,370
interview seemed very rehearsed<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

82
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-planned</font>

83
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,650
except for that specific portion where

84
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,810
he recited<font color="#E5E5E5"> the addresses no no you'd</font>

85
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,610
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to memorize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to even</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">remember it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no they they must have</font>

87
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,360
planned it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I can't for the life of</font>

88
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,430
me figured out why they would give the

89
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,180
exact address

90
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,880

why are you saying these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

98
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">very strange</font>

00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I also want to point out one other</font>

100

the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these alleged assault</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> took</font>

111
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,590
one is look I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it he's in a tough</font>

112
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,540
spot<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if he did it he's in an awfully</font>

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,010

115
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,360
he's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a tough spot because you</font>

116

not greatly angering women in this

country<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so you have to talk about</font>

119
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,790
dignity<font color="#CCCCCC"> and respect of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> women and and and</font>

120
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,830
he also has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> careful about</font>

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">his answers not to incriminate himself</font>

122
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">but at the same time this looks so</font>

123
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,340
rehearsed and faked<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I don't do</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Deborah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ramirez was honest about that</font>

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">corroborated it or to say that it was it</font>

would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been the talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of campus he in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of what he heard a couple days after the</font>

217
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:19,820

218
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,530
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow were</font>

happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so were at least as it was</font>

221
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,060
airing and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Meyer noted that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ferro reported at least one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> witness</font>

223
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggest that the event was talked about</font>

224
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,130
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> campus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the days afterward she</font>

225
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">continues to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write and so it was a</font>

226
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,789
classmate<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard about it at the time</font>

227
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,700
told me he has<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought of it every time</font>

228
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,930
he hears<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kevin</font>

229
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">namor heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cavanaugh's name for the</font>

230
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,710
last 35 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

231
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that part of the story</font>

232
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,760
but to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> corroborated it</font>

233
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,350
and to say hey people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have been</font>

234
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no one was it's</font>

235
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,160
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not true at all</font>

236
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,820
yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> but here I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot</font>

237
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,480
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a mixed record because now</font>

238
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,459
remember no one is saying they were at

239
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:12,589
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> party and saw it happen</font>

240
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:14,930
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who's saying and he was</font>

241
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,320
a hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that people told</font>

242
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,320
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the party</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so that goes against</font>

243
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cavanaugh's point that nobody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on campus</font>

244
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:24,310
was talking about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they were</font>

245
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,290
but there is no other witness right now

246
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,959
that was at that party and and in the

247
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,970
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Ramirez look do I think she's</font>

248
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,970
genuine<font color="#CCCCCC"> given her over-the-top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> honesty</font>

249
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,950
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how she doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember certain</font>

250
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">things and how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> intoxicated she was etc I</font>

251
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,810
I believe she's totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> genuine on the</font>

252
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,880
other hand that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tough thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

253
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,770
accuse somebody of to say like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

254
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,140
remember if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was him but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after six</font>

255
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,029
days of thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

256
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:53,690
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just look if that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was against</font>

257
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the an ally of mine or a friend of mine</font>

258
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,029
I'd say that's a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> tough way to</font>

259
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:02,240
accuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone so yeah look I agree with</font>

260
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,660
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do think based on the</font>

261
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,660
way Republicans have shifted in the way

262
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,160
that they're handling these these

263
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,160
allegations<font color="#E5E5E5"> The New Yorker piece might</font>

264
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,880
