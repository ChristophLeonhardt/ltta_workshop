Laura: JUSTIN MOMENTS AGO, HOUSE G.O.P. RELEASING THE TEXT OF THEIR NEW IMMIGRATION PROPOSAL EXPECTED TO BE BROUGHT TO THE FLOOR AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK. WOW. WHAT'S THE RUSH? AMONG THE HIGHLIGHTS: ENDING THE CONTROVERSIAL POLICY DOES CATCH AND RELEASE ENSURING MINERS WHO ENTER THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY ARE NOT SEPARATED FROM THE PARENTS. THAT'S NOT GOING TO DRAW MORE PEOPLE AND PARENT CALLS FOR AN END LOTTERY SYSTEM. BUT INSTEAD REALLOCATE FOR 55,000 VISAS TO SUPPOSEDLY A MERIT-BASED PROGRAM. LET'S DISCUSS WITH CONGRESSMAN RON DeSANTIS. AND MONEY FOR THE WALL, BARELY. 25 BILLION FOR THE WALL. RON, NO E-VERIFY WHICH I'M TOLD DOESN'T MATTER I THINK IT MATTERS. THE CHAMBER DOESN'T LIKE E-VERIFY. E-VERIFY MEANS YOU DON'T GET TO WORK UNLESS YOU ARE VERIFIED TO BE LEGALLY IN THE COUNTRY, CORRECT? CHAMBER DOESN'T WANTED. IF YOU ARE DOING AN AMNESTY THAT'S 1.8, MOVING MORE MILLION PEOPLE. Laura: WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT IN THE BULLETS. IT'S GOING TO CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR MORE PEOPLE TO COME ILLEGALLY. IF YOU DON'T HAVE E-VERIFY TO KIND OF REMOVE A DISINCENTIVE, THAT WALL, EVEN IF IT'S A GOOD FAITH EFFORT AT THE WALL, AND I'M NOT SURE IT IS, IT AIN'T GOING TO BE BUILT IN A DAY. YOU NEED TO STRIP THE COURTS OF JURISDICTION. THIS WILL GET TIED UP FOREVER WITH THE WALL. WITHOUT E-VERIFY COMING OR GOING TO HAVE A BORDER SURGE LIKE WE HAD IN 2014. THAT OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE MOVING. THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE PRODUCT ACROSS THE BORDER. DRUG CARTELS. Laura: 293 PAGES. WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE THING. THE GOODLATTE BILL HAS WHAT WE CAMPAIGNED ON. THE GOODLATTE BILL AND CHAIN MIGRATION. WE DO THEY SAY THEY WON'T GET IT THROUGH. IT'S NOT GOING TO PASS THE SENATE. PROBABLY WILL PASS THE HOUSE, ALTHOUGH PAUL RYAN IS GOING TO BRING IT NEXT WEEK. GOODLATTE WAS INVOLVED IN RUNNING THE NEW BILL. I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS OR NOT. WE NEED TO DEFUND SANCTUARY CITIES. WE NEED E-VERIFY, END CHAIN MIGRATION, GET RID OF THE VISA DIVERSITY LOTTERY. MAY PEOPLE GO ON RECORD. IT'S NOT A POPULAR VOTE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BUT EVEN IN THE DEMOCRATS DISTRICT, PEOPLE WANT E-VERIFY. IT'S NOT EVEN A PARTISAN THING AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL. Laura: BUSINESS DOESN'T WANT E-VERIFY SO THE MONEY IS COMING INTO THESE CAMPAIGNS. THEY DO NOT WANT TO CHECK THE IDENTITY OF PEOPLE. THAT MEANS IT UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW, HARMS TAXPAYERS AND LOWERS WAGES FOR AMERICANS. Laura: BUT THEY WILL SAY IT'S THE BEST WE CAN DO. AND IT DOES ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHAIN MIGRATION. WE'LL SEE HOW MUCH IT ADDRESSES. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE AMNESTY COULD REACH PARENTS AS WELL. IT'S NOT JUST THE DREAMERS. PARENTS ARE INCLUDED. IT'S GOING TO THE SENATE AND EITHER DIED OR THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE YOURS. THOSE WERE THE ONLY TWO OPTIONS. THE SENATE AIN'T GOING TO JUST PASS THIS. SO YOU'RE REALLY RUNNING A RISK. Laura: DEVIL'S ADVOCATE. THEY SAY THE FREEDOM CAUCUS PEOPLE, YOU NEVER CAN GOVERN. YOU SAY YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING DONE BUT THEN WHEN YOU CAN GET SOMETHING DONE, LIMIT CHAIN MIGRATION, BRING DOWN THE VISA, YOU SAY NO, WERE NOT GOING TO DO IT. THE GOAL IS TO END ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. THIS WOULD FEEL MORE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IF YOU DON'T HAVE THINGS LIKE E-VERIFY. WILL IT WORK? YES OR NO. Laura: THE PRESIDENT HAS GOT TO THINK LONG AND HARD ABOUT
