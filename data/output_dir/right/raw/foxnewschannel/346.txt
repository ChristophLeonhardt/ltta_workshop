00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:25,206
WHO ISN'T HERE TONIGHT?

76
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:27,375
>> CHRIS HAHN DID SOMETHING LAST

77
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:29,177
WEEK THAT DISGUSTED ME.

78
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:31,613
HE ATTACKED AND JUMPED ON THIS

79
00:02:31,614 --> 00:02:33,481
LIBERAL TRAIN TO DESTROY THIS

80
00:02:33,482 --> 00:02:34,215
GOOD MAN.

81
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:37,352
I WAS DEEPLY OFFENDED BY THAT.

82
00:02:37,353 --> 00:02:39,054
DAYS YOU A VINDICATION.

83
00:02:39,055 --> 00:02:41,456
CHRIS, NOW DO YOU LIKE THEM

84
00:02:41,457 --> 00:02:42,190
APPLES.

85
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:46,194
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE GOT TO SAY.

86
00:02:46,195 --> 00:02:49,197
IT'S LIKE "GOODWILL

87
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:49,230

YOU LIKE APPLES?

93
00:02:53,135 --> 00:02:55,837
IT WAS A VINDICATION OF

94
00:02:55,838 --> 00:02:56,471
TRUMPISM.

95
00:02:56,472 --> 00:02:59,174
FOR TOO LONG WE HAVE BEEN IN A

96
00:02:59,175 --> 00:03:03,144
POLITICAL BOXING MATCH WITH THE

97
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:05,347
LEFT WEARING BRASS KNUCKLES AND

98
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:09,017
WE HAVE APPEALED TO THE MEDIA

99
00:03:09,018 --> 00:03:12,187
PLEASE TAKE THE KNUCKLES OFF.

100
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:14,689
TRUMP TOOK THE GLOVES OFF.

101
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,725
JUDGE JEANINE: IT'S

102
00:03:16,726 --> 00:03:17,158
UNBELIEVABLE.

103
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,927
ALL MY VIEWERS, THE PRESIDENT IS

104
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:21,196
GOING TO BE CALLING IN THE NEXT

105
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:22,564
FEW MINUTES I'M SURE AFTER HE

106
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:26,201
GETS OUT OF THE ARENA IN TOPEKA,

107
00:03:26,202 --> 00:03:26,568
KANSAS.

108
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:29,704
WE'LL BE ABLE TO TALK TO HIM ON

109
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:31,172
ONE OF THE MOST OF EXCITING DAYS

110
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:32,907
OF HIS PRESIDENCY.

111
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:34,909
WHO COULD HAVE PREDICTED THIS

112
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,813
WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN?

113
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:40,749
BRETT KAVANAUGH WENT FROM A

114
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,118
GREAT CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE THE A

115
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:45,854
GUY INVOLVED IN GANG RAPES, A

116
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:47,088
SEXUAL PREDATOR.

117
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:48,790
SOME OF THE DARKEST DAYS THEY

118
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,992
HAD TO BE OF BRETT KAVANAUGH'S

119
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:51,726
LIFE.

120
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:54,462
NOW HE'S BACK UP AND JUST SWORN

121
00:03:54,463 --> 00:03:54,729
IN.

122
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,167
AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE

123
00:03:59,168 --> 00:03:59,634
SUPREME COURT.

124
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:01,870
>> THE ONLY RON THAT HAPPENED IS

125
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:02,971
BRETT KAVANAUGH WENT TO THAT

126
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:04,472
HEARING IN THE SENATE AND

127
00:04:04,473 --> 00:04:06,408
CONNECTED WITH THE AMERICAN

128
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:08,576
PEOPLE AND HONESTLY AND

129
00:04:08,577 --> 00:04:10,745
AGGRESSIVELY PUSHED BACK ON

130
00:04:10,746 --> 00:04:13,248
THOSE SCURRILOUS CHARGES.

131
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:15,316
IT WAS THAT MOMENT THAT SEALED

132
00:04:15,317 --> 00:04:18,253
HIS FATE THAT HE WOULD BE

133
00:04:18,254 --> 00:04:19,421
CONFIRMED TO THE SUPREME COURT.

134
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:23,058
PEOPLE WERE SO ENTHRALLED BY THE

135
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:24,726
SHEER HONESTY AND EMOTION OF ALL

136
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:25,593
THIS.

137
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:26,961
EVERY AMERICAN FELT THE PAIN OF

138
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:27,962
IT.

139
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:30,999
THEY KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN

140
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,467
SOMEONE GETS RAILROAD.

141
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:35,670
IT WAS A GREAT INJUSTICE.

142
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:37,472
JUDGE JEANINE: IT WASN'T JUST

143
00:04:37,473 --> 00:04:40,842
BEING RAILROAD, MATT.

144
00:04:40,843 --> 00:04:43,545
IT WAS ABOUT ELIMINATING THE

145
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:45,013
RESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.

146
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:47,215
IT WAS ABOUT A MOB RULE

147
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:48,883
DICTATING THAT ALL WOMEN SHOULD

148
00:04:48,884 --> 00:04:50,885
BE BELIEVED AND MEN SHOULD JUST

149
00:04:50,886 --> 00:04:51,853
SHUT UP.

150
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:54,522
MY FEAR WAS THAT LADY JUSTICE

151
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:58,126
WAS NOT ONLY HAVING THE BANDAGE

152
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:00,228
RIPPED OFF AND TOLD WHICH WAY TO

153
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:02,130
GO, BUT SHE WAS BEING THROWN OUT

154
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:04,232
OF THE GAME TOTALLY.

155
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:06,501
AND THAT WAS FRIGHTENING TO A

156
00:05:06,502 --> 00:05:08,436
LOT OF AMERICANS WHO BELIEVE IN

157
00:05:08,437 --> 00:05:11,573
THE SYSTEM AND THE PRESUMPTION

158
00:05:11,574 --> 00:05:12,841
OF INNOCENCE.

159
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:14,642
IT MAY HAVE BROUGHT OUT A LOT OF

160
00:05:14,643 --> 00:05:16,111
PEOPLE WHO WOULDN'T HAVE CARED

161
00:05:16,112 --> 00:05:17,946
ABOUT A SUPREME COURT

162
00:05:17,947 --> 00:05:18,346
NOMINATION.

163
00:05:18,347 --> 00:05:21,182
>> WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS

164
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:21,783
ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE.

165
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:23,551
THE LEFT HAS DONE THIS BEFORE.

166
00:05:23,552 --> 00:05:27,455
THEY LOB A GRENADE ON A

167
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:28,690
POLITICAL BATTLEFIELD.

168
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:30,825
IN THIS CASE IT WAS RACIST.

169
00:05:30,826 --> 00:05:32,293
WHICH WAS DISGUSTING.

170
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:34,562
IN THE PAST A LESSER PRESIDENT

171
00:05:34,563 --> 00:05:36,264
WOULD HAVE BACKED AWAY

172
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:37,732
IMMEDIATELY AND SAID FOR THE

173
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:40,368
BETTER OF THE COUNTRY, STEP

174
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:41,169
ASIDE.

175
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,338
TRUMP SAID NO, NOT TODAY.

176
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:44,405
WHEN BRETT KAVANAUGH GOT UP

177
00:05:44,406 --> 00:05:46,274
THERE AND SAID NOT TODAY, NOT ON

178
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:47,175
MY WATCH.

179
00:05:47,176 --> 00:00:00,000
I MAY NOT SIT ON THE SUPREME
