>>> WE ARE COMING ON THE AIR 
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE DEPUTY 
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN 
IS ABOUT TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT
RELATED TO THE MUELLER 
INVESTIGATION.
BUT THERE YOU SEE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND THE FIRST LADY MELANIA
TRUMP MEETING WITH THE QUEEN 
TODAY IN GREAT BRITAIN.
HIS MEETING WITH THERESA MAY 
YEARLY TODAY AND THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE HE HAD THIS MORNING 
ALSO IN GREAT BRITAIN.
THIS IS, OF COURSE, AHEAD OF HIS
MEETING ON MONDAY IN HWITH VLAD 
PUTIN.
BLACK TIE DINNER LAST NIGHT ALSO
IN GREAT BRITAIN.
THIS IS ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS 
FOR THE TRIP FOR THE PRESIDENT 
AND THE FIRST LADY.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE 
HEADLINES IN GREAT BRITAIN WITH 
HIS CRITICISM OF THERESA MAY, 
HIS PRAISE OF ONE OF HER 
OPPONENTS WHO JUST LEFT THE 
GOVERNMENT, THE FOREIGN MINISTER
BORIS JOHNSON, AND PROTESTS 
ACROSS GREAT BRITAIN.
THE PRESIDENT BEING MET THERE BY
QUEEN ELIZABETH.
PRESIDENT IS EXAMINED TO SPEND 
THE WEEKEND AT ONE OF HIS GOLF 
RESORTS IN SCOTLAND, TURN BERRY.
MIGHT GET A LITTLE GOLF IN, 
PREPARING FOR THE MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT PUTIN.
THE PRESIDENT LIKES THE POMP OF 
THESE TRIPS.
REMEMBER THE BIG MILITARY PARADE
HE HAD IN PARIS, LIKED IT SO 
MUCH THAT HE'S ASKED OUR 
MILITARY TO REPLICATE IT.
THAT'S GOING TO COME UP IN 
NOVEMBER OF THIS YEAR.
ON THE BUSINESS SIDE, IT HAS 
BEEN A CONTROVERSIAL TRIP.
THE PRESIDENT SAID IN HIS 
MEETING WITH THE NATO LEADERS HE
IS WILLING TO GO IT ALONG IF 
THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW UP ON THEIR 
PLEDGE TO INCREASE DEFENSE 
SPENDING.
THE HEADLINES SURPRISED THE 
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER THERESA 
MAY.
THEY'RE TRYING TO CLEAN THAT UP 
AS WELL.
THIS PART OF THE TRIP IS 
CEREMONIAL.
AS WE SEE THAT NOW WE HAVE 
LEARNED THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY 
GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN WILL BE 
ANNOUNCING AN DIE.
RUSSIAN NATIONALS RELATED TO THE
HACK OF THE DNC. 
>> THE INDICTMENT COMES AS THE 
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO MEET WITH 
VLADIMIR PUTIN.
IT CHARGES THAT RUSSIAN 
NATIONALS ASSOCIATED WITH 
RUSSIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE 
HACKED THE DNC AND THEN GOT THAT
INFORMATION OUT TO HARM THE 
CAMPAIGN OF HILLARY CLINTON.
SO THEY'RE CHARGING NOW 
INDICTMENTS TODAY AGAINST 
RUSSIAN NATIONALS IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE HACK OF THE DNC, 
GEORGE. 
>> ALL OF THEM ARE MEMBERS OF 
THE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE 
SERVICES ON TOP OF THE THREE 
ENTITIES INDICTED BACK IN 
FEBRUARY.
I WANT TO BRING IN CHRIS 
CHRISTIE AS WELL, FORMER 
GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY, ADVISER 
TO THE PRESIDENT FOR A LONG 
TIME.
CHRIS, THE TIMING HERE 
UNMISTAKABLE, JUST A FEW DAYS 
BEFORE THE PRESIDENT'S SUMMIT 
WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN?
>> THAT'S A VERY AGGRESSIVE MOVE
BY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE 
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF SOME OF 
THE ANSWERS THE PRESIDENT GAVE 
TO QUESTIONS HOW MUCH HE WOULD 
CHALLENGE PRESIDENT PUTIN ON THE
IDEA THEY WERE MEDDLING IN THE 
U.S. ELECTION.
IT'S UNMISTAKABLE TO CONCLUDE 
THAT BOB MUELLER WANTED TO MAKE 
SURE THAT WAS NOT A DEBATABLE 
POINT ON THIS ISSUE. 
>> YOU NOW HAVE UNANIMOUS 
FINDINGS OF THE AMERICAN 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, AND NOW 
25 RUSSIAN NATIONALS INDICTED BY
ROBERT MUELLER. 
>> LISTEN, GEORGE, I'VE SAID 
THERE'S NO DEBATE WHETHER 
RUSSIANS TRIED TO MEDDLE IN THE 
ELECTION.
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THEY DID.
AND NOW YOU'RE FINDING THAT A 
SPECIAL COUNSEL WITH GRAND JURY 
SUBPOENA AUTHORITY HAS COME TO 
THE CONCLUSION AND MORE 
IMPORTANTLY, GEORGE, A GRAND 
JURY OF ORDER AMERICANS HAS 
FOUND PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE 
THAT THEY MEDDLED.
THAT MAKES IT MORE POWERFUL.
NORMAL AMERICANS HAVE REACHED 
THE SAME CONCLUSION. 
>> WE HAVE A CONSPIRACY OF 
RUSSIAN NATIONALS AND HE IS 
CHARGED PAUL MANAFORT, THE 
FORMER CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN WITH 
TAX FRAUD AND OTHER VIOLATIONS.
HE'S REACHED GUILTY PLEAS WITH 
RICK GATES AND MICHAEL FLYNN, 
THE FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY 
ADVISER, PAPADOPOULOS AS WELL. 
>> THERE'S NO INDICATION, BUT 
IT'S NOTABLE AT THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE THE PRESIDENT HAD 
TODAY WITH THERESA MAY, THE 
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER, HE 
REFERRED ONCE AGAIN TO THE 
MUELLER INVESTIGATION AS A 
WITCH-HUNT AND ADDED A NEW 
ADJECTIVE, A RI"RIGGED" 
WITCH-HUNT.
NOW WE SEE MUELLER COMING OUT 
WITH THESE INDICTMENTS.
I THINK THE TIMING IS INCREDIBLY
SIGNIFICANT HERE, GEORGE, THE 
FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT IS ABOUT
TO SIT DOWN WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN 
AT A SUMMIT MEETING.
MUELLER CAN DO THESE INDICTMENTS
WHENEVER HE WANTS.
HE'S DECIDED TO DO IT ON THE EVE
OF THAT SUMMIT ON MONDAY.
AS GOVERNOR CHRISTIE POINTS OUT,
IT POINTS OUT THIS WILL BE A 
SUBJECT OF THAT SUMMIT MEETING.
>> IT COMES AT A TIME WHERE WE 
KNOW THERE'S BEEN A BIG BACK AND
FORTH BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT'S 
LEGAL TEAM AND ROBERT MUELLER 
OVER WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE THE 
PRESIDENT SIT DOWN WITH ROBERT 
MUELLER FOR AN INTERVIEW ON SOME
OF THESE QUESTIONS, AND IT'S 
BECOME UNMISTAKABLE THERE THAT 
THE PRESIDENT IS VERY UNLIKELY 
TO SIT DOWN FOR THE INTERVIEW. 
>> I WOULD SAY IT'S ABOUT A 
LITTLE BIT NORTH OF A ZERO 
PERCENT CHANCE THAT INTERVIEW 
TAKE PLACE, DESPITE THE FACT THE
PRESIDENT HAS SAID OVER AND OVER
AGAIN AT LEAST TWO TIMES 
DIRECTLY TO ME THAT HE WOULD 
100% SIT DOWN FOR AN INTERVIEW.
IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT HE HAS NOW 
TAKEN THE ADVICE OF HIS LAWYERS,
AD
ADVICE THAT'S BEEN CONSISTENT 
NOT TO DO THAT INTERVIEW.
THE LIST OF INDICTMENTS IS 
PILING UP HERE.
IT SEEMS THAT IT GETS HARDER AND
HARDER TO DISMISS THE 
INVESTIGATION AS A WITCH-HUNT.
IT'S COMING UP WITH INDICTMENTS,
ALTHOUGH, AS THE WHITE HOUSE I'M
SURE WILL POINT OUT, NOTHING 
ANYWHERE, AT LEAST NOTHING YET 
THAT SUGGESTS ANY CONNECTION 
WITH ANYBODY ON THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN. 
>> WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT 
THIS INDICTMENT?
>> YES, THEY'RE NAMING 12 
RUSSIAN NATIONALS.
HERE'S THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY 
GENERAL.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.
TODAY A GRAND JURY IN THE 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA RETURNED AN
INDICTMENT BY THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL'S OFFICE.
IT CHARGES 12 RUSSIAN MILITARY 
OFFICERS FOR CON EXPIRING TO 
INTERFERE WITH THE 2018 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
11 OF THE DEFENDANTS ARE CHARGED
WITH CON PYRING TO HACK INTO 
COMPUTERS, STEAL DOCUMENTS AND 
RELEASE THOSE DOCUMENTS WITH THE
INTENT TO INTERFERE IN THE 
ELECTION.
ONE OF THOSE DEFENDANTS AND A 
12th RUSSIAN MILITARY OFFICER 
ARE CHARGED WITH CONSPIRING TO 
INFILTRATE COMPUTERS OF 
ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN 
ELECTIONS.
ACCORDING TO THE ALLEGATIONS IN 
THE INDICTMENT, THE DEFENDANTS 
WORKED FOR TWO UNITS OF THE MAIN
INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE OF THE 
GRU.
THEY ENGAGED IN OPERATIONS TO 
INTERFERE IN THE 2016 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
THERE WAS ONE UNIT THAT ENGAGED 
IN ACTIVE CYBER OPERATIONS BY 
STEALING INFORMATION, AND A 
DIFFERENT UNIT THAT WAS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR DISSEMINATING 
THE STOLEN INFORMATION.
THE DEFENDANTS USED TWO 
TECHNIQUES TO STEAL INFORMATION.
FIRST, THEY USED A SCHEME KNOWN 
AS SPEAR FISHING WHICH SENDS 
MISLEADING E-MAIL MESSAGES AND 
TRICKING USERS TO DISCLOSING 
THEIR PASS WORDS AND SECURITY 
INFORMATION.
SECOND THEY HACKED INTO COMPUTER
NETWORKS AND INSTALLED MALICIOUS
SOFTWARE THAT ALLOWED THEM TO 
SPY ON USERS AND CAPTURE KEY 
STROKES, TAKE SCREEN SHOTS AND 
REMOVE DATA FROM THOSE 
COMPUTERS.
THE DEFENDANTS' ACCESS TO E-MAIL
ACCOUNTS OF VOLUNTEERS AND 
EMPLOYEES OF A U.S. PRESIDENTIAL
CAMPAIGN, INCLUDING THE CAMPAIGN
CHAIRMAN STARTING IN MARCH OF 
2016.
THEY ALSO HACKED INTO THE 
COMPUTER NETWORKS OF A 
CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN 
COMMCOMMITTEE
AND A NATIONAL COMMITTEE.
THEY MONITORED THE COMPUTERS AND
PLANTED HUNDREDS OF FILES, 
STOLEN E-MAILS AND OTHER 
DOCUMENTS.
THE CONSPIRACY TORS CREATED 
FICTITIOUS ONLINE PERSONAS 
INCLUDING DC LEAKS AND GUCCIFER 
2.0, AND THEY USED THOSE 
PERSONAS TO RELEASE INFORMATION 
INCLUDING THOUSANDS OF STOLEN 
E-MAILS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS 
BEGINNING IN JUNE OF 2016.
THE DEFENDANTS' FALSELY CLAIMED 
THE DC LEAKS WAS A GROUP OF 
AMERICAN HACKERS AND GUCCIFER 
2.0 WAS A LONE ROMAINEIAN 
HACKER.
IN FACT BOTH WERE CREATED AND 
CONTROLLED BY THE RUSSIAN GRU.
NATION TO RELEASING DOCUMENTS 
DIRECTLY TO THE PUBLIC, THE 
DEFENDANTS TRANSFERRED STOLEN 
DOCUMENTS TO ANOTHER 
ORGANIZATION THAT IS NOT 
IDENTIFIED BY NAME IN THE 
INDICTMENT, AND THEY USED THAT 
ORGANIZATION AS A PASS-THROUGH 
TO RELEASE THE DOCUMENTS.
THEY DISCUSSED THE TIMING OF THE
RELEASE IN AN ATTEMPT TO ENHANCE
THE IMPACT ON THE ELECTION.
IN AN EFFORT TO CONCEAL THEIR 
CONNECTIONS TO RUSSIA, THE 
DEFENDANTS USED A NETWORK OF 
COMPUTERS AROUND THE WORLD AND 
THEY PAID FOR IT USING 
CRYPTOCURRENCIES.
THE CONSPIRACY TORS CORRESPONDED
WITH SEVERAL AMERICANS DURING 
THE CONSPIRACY THROUGH THE 
INTERNET.
THERE'S NO ALLEGATION IN THIS 
INDICTMENT THAT THE AMERICANS 
KNEW THEY WERE CORRESPONDING 
WITH RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE 
OFFICERS.
IN A SECOND RELATED CONSPIRACY, 
RUSSIAN GRU OFFICERS HACKED THE 
WEBSITE OF A STATE ELECTION 
BOARD AND STOLE INFORMATION 
ABOF 
500,000 VOTERS.
THEY SENT SPEAR FISHING E-MAILS 
TO PEOPLE INVOLVED IN ELECTIONS,
INCLUDING ATTACHING MALICIOUS 
SOFTWARE.
THE INDICTMENT INCLUDES 11 
CRIMINAL ALLEGATIONS AND A 
COUNTS 2 THROUGH 9 CHARGED THE 
DEFENDANTS WITH AGGRAVATED 
IDENTITY THEFT BY BLOWING USER 
NAMES AND PASS WORDS OF VICTIMS 
IN ORDER TO COMMIT COMPUTER 
FRAUD.
COUNT 10 CHARGES THOSE 11 
DEFENSE WITH MONEY LAUNDERING 
FOR TRANSFERRING MONEY TO 
REGISTER DOMAINS WHILE TRYING TO
CONCEAL THEIR CONNECTIONS TO 
RUSSIA.
COUNT 11 CHARGES TWO DEFENDANTS 
FOR SEPARATE CONSPIRACY TO 
ACCESS COMPUTERS WITHOUT 
AUTHORIZATION AND TO DAMAGE 
THOSE COMPUTERS IN CONNECTION 
WITH EFFORTS TO INFILTRATE 
COMPUTERS USED TO ADMINISTER 
ELECTIONS.
THERE'S NO ALLEGATION IN THIS 
INDICTMENT THAT ANY AMERICAN 
CITIZEN COMMITTED A CRIME.
THERE'S NO ALLEGATION THAT THE 
CONSPIRACY CHANGED THE VOTE 
COUNT OR AFFECTED ANY ELECTION 
RESULT.
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S 
INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING AND 
THERE WILL BE NO COMMENTS ON THE
SPECIAL COUNSEL AT THIS TIME.
ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL JOHN 
DEMUR IS WITH ME TODAY BECAUSE 
WE INTEND TO TRANSFER 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS 
INDICTMENT TO THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT'S NATIONAL SECURITY 
DIVISION WHILE WE AWAIT THE 
APPREHENSION OF THE DEFENDANTS.
I WANT TO CAUTION YOU THE PEOPLE
WHO SPECULATE ABOUT FEDERAL 
INVESTIGATIONS USUALLY DO NOT 
KNOW ALL OF THE RELEVANT FACTS.
WE DO NOT TRY CASES ON 
TELEVISION OR IN CONGRESSIONAL 
HEARINGS.
MOST ANONYMOUS LEAKS ARE NOT 
FROM THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 
WHO ARE ACTUALLY CONDUCTING 
THESE INVESTIGATIONS.
WE FOLLOW THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH
MEANS THAT WE FOLLOW PROCEDURES,
AND WE RESERVE JUDGMENT.
WE COMPLETE OUR INVESTIGATIONS 
AND WE EVALUATE ALL OF THE 
RELEVANT EVIDENCE BEFORE WE 
REACH ANY CONCLUSION.
THAT IS HOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
EXPECT THEIR DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE TO OPERATE, AND THAT IS 
HOW OUR DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO 
OPERATE.
IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM EVERYONE 
WHO'S CHARGED WITH A CRIME IS 
PRESUMED INNOCENT UNLESS AND 
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.
IT SHOULD GO WITHOUT SAYING THE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CHARGED WITH 
A CRIME ALSO ARE PRESUMED 
INNOCENT.
THE INDICTMENT WAS RETURNED 
TODAY BECAUSE INCORPORATES 
DETERMINED THAT THE EVIDENCE WAS
SUFFICIENT TO PRESENT THESE 
ALLEGATIONS TO A FEDERAL GRAND 
JURY.
OUR ANALYSIS IS BASED SOLELY ON 
THE FACTS, THE LAW, AND 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE POLICIES.
I BRIEFED PRESIDENT TRUMP ABOUT 
THESE ALLEGATIONS YEARLY THIS 
WEEK.
THE PRESIDENT IS FULLY AWARE OF 
THE DEPARTMENT'S ACTIONS TODAY.
I HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED THE 
VICTIMS.
WE
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO VOID 
THINKING POLITICALLY AS 
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, 
INSTEAD THINKING PATRIOTLY AS 
AMERICANS.
OUR RESPONSE MUST NOT DEPEND ON 
WHICH SIDE WAS VICTIMIZED.
THE INTERNET ALLOWS FOREIGN 
ADVERSARY TOSS ATTACK AMERICA IN
MY AND UNEXPECTED WAYS, FREE AND
FAIR ELECTIONS ARE ALWAYS HARD 
FOUGHT AND CONTENTIOUS.
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ADD VER 
SAYERS TO SEEK TO EXACERBATE OUR
DIVISIONS AND TRY TO CONFUSE, 
DIVIDE, AND CONQUER US.
SO LONG AS WE ARE UNITED IN OUR 
COMMITMENT TO THE VALUES 
ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION, 
THEY WILL NOT SUCCEED.
A PARTISAN WARFARE FUELED BY 
MODERN TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT 
FAIRLY REFLECT THE GRACE, 
DIGNITY, AND UNITY OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
THE BLAME BELONGS ON THE 
CRIMINALS.
WE NEED TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD 
TO PRESERVE OUR VALUES, PROTECT 
AGAINST FUTURE INTERFERENCE AND 
DEFEND AMERICA.
I HAVE TIME TO TAKE A FEW 
QUESTIONS.
>> GENERAL ROSENSTEIN, A 
QUESTION FOR YOU, SIR.
NUMBER ONE, THE TIMING ON THE 
EVE OF THE PRESIDENT'S MEETING, 
CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT?
>> THE TIMING, AS I MENTIONED, 
IS A FUNCTION OF THE COLLECTION 
OF THE FACTS, THE EVIDENCE AND 
THE LAW AND A DETERMINATION THAT
IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO PRESENT THE
INDICTMENT AT THIS TIME.
AS I MENTIONED, I BRIEFED THE 
PRESIDENT.
WITH REGARD TO THE NATURE OF THE
INVESTIGATION, I ONLY COMMENT ON
THE EVIDENCE.
THE EVIDENCE THAT IS REFLECTED 
IN OUR INDICTMENTS AND CHARGES 
REPRESENTS A DETERMINATION BY 
PROSECUTORS AND AGENT WITHOUT 
REGARD TO APPLICATIONS THAT THE 
EVIDENCE IS SUFFICIENT TO 
JUSTIFY THE CHARGES. 
>> DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, I 
KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FACT 
IN A THAT IN YOUR VIEW THE 
EVIDENCE DOESN'T SHOW ANY VOTES 
WERE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THIS
HACKING, BUT YOU DID SAY THAT A 
COMPANY USED AS A PASS-THROUGH 
COORDINATED WITH THESE 
DEFENDANTS TO ENHANCE THE TIMING
OF THE RELEASE AND THE IMPACT ON
THE ELECTION.
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT THE 
EVIDENCE SHOWS IN THAT RESPECT?
>> WHAT I HAVE TALKED ABOUT IS 
WHAT THE ALLEGED IN THE 
INDICTMENT.
WE KNOW ACCORDING TO THE 
ALLEGATIONS IN THE INDICTMENT 
THE GOAL OF THE CONSPIRATORS WAS
TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE 
ELECTIONS AND WHAT THEIR 
MOTIVATION MAY HAVE BEEN TO 
PROVE THIS OFFENSE IS A MATTER 
OF SPECULATION.
THAT'S NOT OUR RESPONSIBILITY.
THERE'S NO ALLEGATIONS IN THE 
INDICTMENT ABOUT IT, AND THAT'S 
NOT OUR CHARGE.
>> IN TERMS OF THE STATE 
ELECTION INFORMATION, 500,000 
VOTERS, INFORMATION WAS 
COLLECTED, IS THERE EVIDENCE 
WHAT THE RUSSIANS DID WITH THAT 
INFORMATION AND IS THERE 
EVIDENCE OF OTHER STATES BEING 
SUCCESSFULLY PENETRATED BY THE 
RUSSIANS?
>> IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO 
UNDERSTAND WHAT I TOLD YOU THE 
ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN
THE INDICTMENT.
THE FBI AND OTHER INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY AGENCIES ARE WORKING 
CONSTANTLY TO DEFEND AGAINST 
CYBERATTACKS IN THE UNITED 
STATES.
THIS CASE IS JUST ABOUT ONE 
PARTICULAR EFFORT THAT WAS MADE 
DURING THE 2016 ELECTION.
THE EFFORTS OF OUR DEPARTMENT, 
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY AND ALL THE STATE 
ELECTION BOARDS THROUGHOUT THE 
COUNTRY ARE ONGOING, AND THOSE 
EFFORTS PRECEDED THIS INDICTMENT
AND THEY'RE GOING TO POST-DATE 
THIS INDICTMENT.
SO WE HAVE CONTINUED TO SHIRE 
RELEVANT INTELLIGENCE WITH OUR 
PARTNERS.
THERE IS A CONCERTED AND 
ORGANIZED EFFORT BY THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 
DO DETER AND PREVENT ANY SORT OF
CYBERATTACKS ON OUR ELECTIONS. 
>> YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU 
BRIEFED PRESIDENT TRUMP EARLIER 
THIS WEEK.
DID HE INDICATE HIS SUPPORT FOR 
THIS ACTION AND WHAT WAS HIS 
REACTION?
>> I'LL LET THE PRESIDENT SPEAK 
FOR HIMSELF.
IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO KNOW
BECAUSE HE'S GOT TO MAKE 
IMPORTANT DECISIONS FOR THE 
COUNTRY.
SO HE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT 
EVIDENCE WE HAVE FOR ELECTION 
INTERFERENCE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> THERE YOU HAVE IT, THE DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN 
ANNOUNCING THAT SPECIAL COUNSEL 
ROBERT MUELLER HAS INDICTED 12 
RUSSIAN NATIONALS FOR 
CONSPIRACYING TO INTERFERE IN 
OUR ELECTIONS BY HACKING THE 
COMPUTERS OF THE DNC AND HILLARY
CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN.
ROD ROSENSTEIN WONT NAME THE 
VICTIMS IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE,
EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NAMED IN 
THE INDICTMENT.
AND WE HAVE ONE OF THE CHIEF 
TARGETS ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW, 
JOHN PODESTA WHOSE E-MAIL WAS 
HACKED BACK IN APRIL OF 2016 AND
RELEASED OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
CAMPAIGN.
YOUR REACTION TO THESE 
INDICTMENTS, JOHN?
>> GEORGE, I THINK AT THE HEART 
OF ALL OF THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
THE FACT THAT CRIMES THAT WERE 
COMMITTED AGAINST INDIVIDUAL 
AMERICANS INCLUDING MYSELF, BUT 
ALSO CRIMES COMMITTED AGAINST 
THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.
AND I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, 
DONALD TRUMP LIKES TO DESCRIBE 
THIS AS A WITCH-HUNT.
WELL, WE JUST FOUND SOME WITCHES
AND THEY WERE INDICTED.
I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 
PEOPLE KNEW HAD HAPPENED ALL 
ALONG, THAT UNDERLYING ALL THIS 
CRIMES WERE COMMITTED AND THAT'S
WHY THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION 
HAS BEEN SO IMPORTANT AND WHY IT
NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED IN AN 
UNFETTERED MANNER. 
>> ROD ROSENSTEIN ISN'T MAKING 
THE ALLEGATION IN THIS 
INDICTMENT THESE HACKS CHANGED 
THE COURSE OF THE ELECTION.
YOUR VIEW ON THAT?
>> YOU KNOW, LOOK, I THINK WHEN 
AN ELECTION IS SO CLOSE IT'S 
HARD TO PUT YOUR FINGER ON ANY 
ONE PARTICULAR ISSUE, BUT 
CLEARLY THIS HAD SOME IMPACT.
I'M SORRY, I GOT A LITTLE BIT OF
NOISE ON THE CALL, GEORGE.
BUT WITH I THINK THE DECISION TO
DRIBBLE THESE OUT OVER THE 
COURSE OF A MONTH WHICH INTENDED
TO HURT OUR CAMPAIGN AND TO WHAT
EXTENT IT WAS USED IN ORDER TO 
FUEL, AGAIN, OTHER ACTIVITIES 
THAT WERE DONE BY BOTH THE 
RUSSIANS AND AMERICAN SOURCES 
WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE FOR HISTORY 
TO JUDGE. 
>> THE INDICTMENT LAYING THIS 
RIGHT AT THE FEET OF VLADIMIR 
PUTIN, HIS MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
YOU KNOW, THESE WERE OPERATIONS 
CONDUCTED BY RUSSIAN MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE, BY THE GRU, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE MEETING 
PRESIDENT PUTIN IN THE NEXT 
COUPLE DAYS.
YOU KNOW, ONE WOULD HOPE THAT HE
WOULD PUSH BACK ON THE RUSSIAN 
PRESIDENT IN THAT REGARD WHO HAS
CLEARLY, I THINK, AUTHORIZED 
THESE INVESTIGATIONS, BUT I 
DON'T HOLD OUT MUCH HOPE THAT HE
WILL TAKE THIS ANY MORE 
SERIOUSLY THAN HE HAS IN HIS 
PRESIDENT. 
>> CHRIS CHRISTIE, YOU JUST 
HEARD THAT LAST POINT FROM JOHN 
PODESTA RIGHT THERE.
THE PRESIDENT BRIEFED ON THIS 
ACCORDING TO ROD ROSENSTEIN 
EARLIER IN THE WEEK.
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS WILL OR 
SHOULD CHANGE THE PRESIDENT'S 
STANCE TOWARD VLADIMIR PUTIN IN 
THIS SUMMIT COMING UP ON MONDAY?
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S GOING
TO SAY WE HAVE EVIDENCE OF 
RUSSIAN MILITARY PERSONNEL WHO 
WERE VERY INVOLVED IN THE 
HACKING OF THE TOWNS PEOPLE WHO 
WERE PARTICIPATING IN THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2016.
SO I DO THINK THIS IS AN 
IMPORTANT BIT OF INFORMATION TO 
HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH THE 
PRESIDENT.
I'M GLAD THAT DEPUTY ATTORNEY 
GENERAL ROSENSTEIN SHARED IT 
WITH THE PRESIDENT PRIOR TO ITS 
RELEASE AND PRIOR TO HIS 
DEPARTURE FROM THE UNITED STATES
SO HE COULD HAVE THAT 
INFORMATION BEFORE HE GOES TO 
SEE PRESIDENT PUTIN.
THERE'S NO QUESTION, GEORGE, 
THAT THIS IS POWER INFORMATION 
THAT ADDS TO THE NARRATIVE THAT 
THE RUSSIANS WERE ATTEMPTING IN 
SOME WAY TO INTERFERE IN THE 
ELECTION IN THE UNITED STATES.
THIS IS SOMETHING I AM CONFIDENT
THE PRESIDENT IS NOW GOING TO 
RAISE WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN ON 
MOUND. 
>> WE HEARD FROM ROD ROSENSTEIN 
DURING THE COURSE OF HIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE THAT SEVERAL 
AMERICANS DID CORRESPOND WITH 
THESE INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS OVER
THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN, OVER
THE COURSE OF THE HACKING.
THOUGH HE SAYS THEY DIDN'T 
NECESSARILY KNOW OR THERE'S 
ALLEGATION KNEW THEY WERE 
CORRESPONDING WITH RUSSIAN 
MILITARY INFORMATION, NO 
INFORMATION THAT ANY AMERICAN 
CITIZENS WERE COOPERATING. 
>> NO AMERICANS, CERTAINLY 
NOBODY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN KNOWINGLY PART OF THIS,
AND NOTHING TO AFFECT THE ACTUAL
VOTE COUNT.
BUT GEORGE, AS YOU REMEMBER, THE
PRESIDENT DURING THE CAMPAIGN 
SAID THE HACKING COULD HAVE BEEN
DONE BY A 400-POUND GUY SITTING 
ON HIS BED.
HE HAS DOWNPLAYED THE RUSSIAN 
INVOLVEMENT ON THIS CONTINUOUSLY
EVEN AS PRESIDENT, EVEN AS HE'S 
HAD ACCESS TO THE INTELLIGENCE.
NOW HE IS LOOKING AT AN 
INDICTMENT THAT GOES RIGHT TO 
THE GRU, THAT IS RUSSIAN 
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE, THE 
LARGEST FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCY IN RUSSIA DIRECTLY AT 
VLADIMIR PUTIN'S FEET JUST AS 
HE'S GOING TO BE SITTING DOWN 
WITH HIM. 
>> FINAL POINT FOR PIERRE 
THOMAS.
NO ALLEGATIONS IN THIS 
INDICTMENT ABOUT AMERICAN 
CITIZENS, BUT THAT LEAVES OPEN 
THE BIG QUESTIONS, WHAT IS NEXT 
FOR ROBERT MUELLER?
>> THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE.
THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING, 
BUT THE DOMINANT POINT IS THE 
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS 
SAYING WE KNOW PRECISELY WHO IN 
THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WAS 
INVOLVED IN THIS HACK, AND WE 
KNOW HOW THEY DID IT.
THEY'RE NAMING AND SHAMING.
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE TODAY, 
GEORGE. 
>> 12 RUSSIAN NATIONALS 
CONNECTED TO RUSSIAN MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE, THAT MEANS 
CONNECTED TO VLADIMIR PUTIN 
INDICTED TODAY BY SPECIAL 
COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER ANNOUNCED
BY THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL 
ROD ROSENSTEIN AHEAD THIS 
IMPORTANT SUMMIT MEETING BETWEEN
THE PRESIDENT AND VLADIMIR 
PUTIN.
WE'RE GOING TO STAY ON TOP OF 
THIS ALL DAY LONG.
FULL REPORT TONIGHT ON THE NEWS
