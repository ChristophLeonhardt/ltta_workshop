(upbeat jazz music)
-  How do you run a meeting?
- I like to have a clear agenda,
know what we're trying to get done,
and get it done as quickly
as possible and move on.
- Listen more, talk less,
and be decisive when the time comes.
- Well prepared, pre-reads, and an agenda.
- I don't have a desk,
we have an open table
with the entire management team sits there
which means people can walk up to us
but I like the interruptions,
I like people coming up
because those are unique
moments to interact with people
and learn things quickly, a
lot of five minute meetings.
- Collaborative, active
listening, dynamic tension.
- To have a mixture of being on time
and having open discussion.
