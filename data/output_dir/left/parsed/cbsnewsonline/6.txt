PAULA REID, THANK YOU. 
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>> Reporter: BEFORE I BEGIN I 
WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK 
ABOUT TODAY'S NEWS AND 
ATTEMPTED ATTACKS ON PRESIDENT 
CLINTON, PRESIDENT OBAMA, THEIR 
FAMILIES, PUBLIC OFFICIALS, 
INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS. 
WE CAN NOT TOLERATE THOSE 
ATTACKS. 
I STRONGLY CONDEMN ALL WHO 
CHOSE VIOLENCE. 
I'M GRATEFUL TO THE SECRET 
SERVICE AS WELL AS THE LOCAL 
AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR 
ALL THEY DO ON A DAILY BASIS TO 
KEEP US SAFE AND ENCOURAGE 
PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO 
CHOSE KINDNESS OVER HATRED. 
I WANT TO WELCOME YOU ALL TO 
THE WHITE HOUSE TO REFLECT ON 
THE PROGRESS THIS 
ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE IN 
TACKLING THE OPIOID CRISIS. 
MORE IMPORTANTLY, TO LOOK AHEAD 
OF THE WORK STILL TO BE DONE. 
WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE 
CONTINUED ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING 
TO COMBAT THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. 
WHICH, MY HUSBAND WILL TALK 
ABOUT IN A FEW MINUTES. 
I MUST SAY I'M PROUD OF OUR 
PRESIDENT AND THE WORK BEING 
DONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
ACROSS SO MANY AGENCIES TO HELP 
THOSE AFFECTED BY DRUG ABUSE 
AND ADDICTION. 
JUST LAST WEEK I VISITED THOMAS 
JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL 
TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR MATERNAL 
ADDICTION TREATMENT, EDUCATION 
AND RESEARCH PROGRAM. 
THIS PROGRAM SUPPORTS FAMILIES 
AND BABIES BORN WITH NEO NATAL 
SYNDROME, PROVIDING MOTHERS BE 
THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO BECOME 
SUCCESSFUL PARENTS. 
MY CAMPAIGN IS COMMITTED TO 
HELPING CHILDREN AND THE MANY 
ISSUES THEY FACE AS THEY GROW 
UP. 
SADLY, DRUG ABUSE IS ONE OF 
THOSE ISSUES. 
WE WILL SHINE A LIGHT ON 
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS THAT 
DEMONSTRATE POSITIVE RESULTS 
FOR CHILDREN. 
OVER THE PAST YEAR I HAVE 
TRAVELED BOTH NATIONALLY AND 
INTERNATIONALLY LEARNING ABOUT 
MANY OF THE PROGRAMS OFFERED TO 
PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS, SCHOOLS 
AND HOSPITALS WHICH ARE MEANT 
TO HELP CHILDREN AND FAMILIES 
AS THEY DEAL WITH DRUG 
ADDICTION. 
WHAT I CONSTANTLY HEAR IS THE 
NEED OF SUPPORT. 
LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS OUR HELP 
TO STOP CRIMINALS FROM PUTTING 
DRUGS ON THE STREETS. 
FAMILIES NEED RESOURCES TO GET 
TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP CARE 
FOR LOVED ONES. 
THOSE WHO ARE ADDICTED NEED THE 
SUPPORT, RESOURCES AND GUIDANCE 
TO KNOW THEY ARE FIGHTING A 
DISEASE AND SHOULD NOT BE 
ASHAMED. 
YOUNG MOTHERS NEED THE SUPPORT 
NECESSARY TO NOT ONLY BE BEAT 
THEIR ADDICTION, BUT HAVE THE 
TOOLS NEEDED TO BECOME 
SUCCESSFUL PARENTS. 
BABIES BORN ADDICTED NEED THE 
RESOURCES FOR TREATMENT. 
BUT ALSO NEED FOLLOW-UP CARE 
FOR YEARS TO COME. 
I WAS HONORED TO BE PART OF A 
ROUNDTABLE COMPRISED OF SEVERAL 
EXPERTS AT THOMAS JEFFERSON 
UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL HELPING 
WITH THE DESIGN OF THE 
INITIATIVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT 
OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IS 
WORKING ON TO MEASURE LONG TERM 
HEALTH OUTCOMES AND NEEDS OF 
INFANTS SUFFERING. 
AS A NATION, WE MUST COME 
TOGETHER TO FIGHT THIS 
EPIDEMIC. 
BY PROVIDING AS MANY RESOURCES 
AS POSSIBLE. 
I KNOW THAT AS LONG AS MY 
HUSBAND IS IN OFFICE, THIS WILL 
REMAIN A PRIORITY. 
FIGHTING OPIOID ABUSE GOES 
ACROSS ALL PARTY LINES. 
THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. 
AND BEING PART OF THE FIGHT TO 
END THIS EPIDEMIC. 
IT IS NOW MY HONOR TO INTRODUCE 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
 
>> I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH. 
I KNOW HOW HARD YOU WORKED ON 
THIS. 
THAT'S ONE OF MANY LANGUAGES 
THAT YOU KNOW. 
THAT'S JUST AMAZING THE WAY YOU 
CAN DO IT. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DARLING, 
APPRECIATE IT. 
I WANT TO THANK MRS. PENCE FOR 
BEING HERE. 
YOU HAVE BEEN TERRIFIC WORKING 
ALONGSIDE OUR GREAT VICE 
PRESIDENT. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, KAREN, 
REALLY APPRECIATE IT. 
 
I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN TODAY'S 
REMARKS BY PROVIDING AN UPDATE 
ON THE SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES AND 
DEVICES MAILED TO CURRENT AND 
FORMER HIGH-RANKING GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS. 
ÃºTHE SAFETY OF THE A 
PEOPLE IS MY HIGHEST AND 
ABSOLUTE PRIORITY. 
I HAVE JUST CONCLUDED A 
BRIEFING WITH THE FBI, 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
AND THE U.S. SECRET SERVICE. 
AS WE SPEAK, THE PACKAGES ARE 
BEING INSPECTED BY TOP 
EXPLOSIVE EXPERTS. 
A MAJOR INVESTIGATION IS
UNDERWAY. 
WE WILL SPARE NO RESOURCES OR 
EXPENSE IN THIS EFFORT TO BRING 
THOSE RESPONSIBLE TO JUSTICE. 
I WANT TO TELL YOU, IN THESE 
TIMES, WE HAVE TO UNIFIE. 
WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AND 
SEND ONE VERY CLEAR, STRONG, 
UNMISTAKABLE MESSAGE THAT ACTS 
OR THREATS OF POLITICAL 
VIOLENCE OF ANY KIND HAVE NO 
PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA. 
 
ONE YEAR AGO I ADDRESSED THE 
NATION IN THIS VERY ROOM AND 
DECLARED THE OPIOID CRISIS A 
NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH 
EMERGENCY. 
THAT'S A LEGAL STATEMENT. 
THAT'S A LEGAL TERM. 
TODAY WE ARE HERE TO UPDATE THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE ON THE HISTORIC 
ACTION WE HAVE TAKEN AND TO 
SIGN LANDMARK LEGISLATION TO 
DEFEAT THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. 
I WANT TO THANK THE CABINET 
MEMBERS IN ATTENDANCE TODAY, 
ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS, 
THANK YOU. 
AND SECRETARIES 
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. 
I KNOW HOW HARD YOU ARE WORKING 
ON THIS AND OTHER THINGS. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU TO KELLYANNE CONWAY 
FOR HER TREMENDOUS EFFORTS. 
THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE IT. 
 WE ARE ALSO 
HONORED TO BE JOINED BY STATE 
AND LOCAL LEADERS, PRIVATE 
SECTOR PARTNERS, ALONG WITH 
FAMILIES WHO HAVE SUFFERED 
TERRIBLE HEARTACHE FROM THE 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC. 
TOGETHER, WE ARE GOING TO END 
THIS GORGE OF DRUG ADDICTION IN 
AMERICA. 
WE ARE GOING TO END IT OR WE 
ARE GOING TO MAKE AN EXTREMELY 
BIG DENT IN THIS TERRIBLE, 
TERRIBLE PROBLEM. 
OVER THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE 
MOBILIZED THE ENTIRE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS THIS 
CRISIS. 
WE HAVE SECURED $6 BILLION IN 
NEW FUNDING TO COMBAT OPIOIDS. 
THE MOST MONEY EVER RECEIVED IN 
HISTORY. 
I WANT TO THANK MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS AND ATTENDANTS TODAY, 
TERRIFIC PEOPLE, WHO HAVE BEEN 
INSTRUMENTAL IN THIS EFFORT. 
ROB PORTMAN. 
THANK YOU, ROB. 
CONGRESSMAN GREG WALDEN. 
AND ALSO FOR RIGHT TO TRY. 
IT IS HAVING A TREMENDOUS 
IMPACT ALREADY. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
ALONG WITH SENATORS SHELLY 
MOORE, BILL CASSIDY, MAGGIE 
HASSAN, REPRESENTATIVES GUS 
VILARAKOS, 
TIM WAHLBERG -- I WANT TO THANK 
YOU ALL. 
THERE COUPLE OF EXTRAS. 
WE'LL THANK YOU AFTERWARDS. 
 
IT IS A GREAT JOB. 
THEY WORK HARD ON IT. 
THEY FEEL STRONGLY. 
MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO 
LAUNCHED AN  UNPRECEDENTED 
EFFORT TO TARGET DRUG DEALERS, 
TRAFFICKERS AND SMUGGLERS. 
WE ARE SHUTTING DOWN ONLINE 
NETWORKS, CRACKING DOWN ON 
INTERNATIONAL SHIPMENTS AND 
GOING AFTER FOREIGN TRAFFICKERS 
LIKE NEVER BEFORE. 
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN 
AUGUST OF THIS YEAR, THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE INDICTED 
TWO CHINESE NATIONALS SHIPPING 
FENTANYL AND OTHER LETHAL DRUGS 
TO OUR COUNTRY. 
HERE WITH US TODAY IS SAM 
MARTINSON OF THE NEBRASKA STATE 
PATROL. 
WHERE IS SAM? 
IN APRIL TROOPER MARTINSON 
SEIZED 870-POUNDS OF FENTANYL. 
IT WAS ENOUGH TO KILL 86 
MILLION PEOPLE. 
THAT WAS A JOB WELL DONE. 
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU COME 
DOWN HERE FOR A SECOND. 
YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GOING 
TO DO THIS. 
COME ON. 
SAY A FEW WORDS. 
>> FIRST OFF, THANK YOU FOR 
HAVING ME HERE TODAY. 
THIS IS A HUGE HONOR. 
NOT JUST FOR MYSELF BUT TO 
REPRESENT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICIALS IN NEBRASKA. 
THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT 
CAME BEFORE ME THAT TAUGHT ME 
HOW TO DO THIS JOB. 
ON BEHALF OF THEM, BEHALF OF 
MYSELF AND BEHALF OF MY FAMILY, 
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE. 
>> GOOD JOB! 
HE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS GOING TO 
DO. 
I SEE A FUTURE POLITICIAN. 
BE CAREFUL, FOLKS. 
GREAT JOB. 
THANK YOU, SIR. 
LAST YEAR THE BRAVE MEN AND 
WOMEN OF I.C.E. 
AND BORDER PATROL -- PEOPLE WE 
HAVE TO REALLY THANK. 
THEY ARE DOING SOME JOB [ 
APPLAUSE ] 
AND IT IS A HARD JOB. 
SEIZED MORE THAN 2.8 MILLION-
POUNDS OF ELICIT AND DEADLY 
DRUGS. 
EARLY ESTIMATS SHOW IN 2017 
AND 2018 FENTANYL SEIZURES WERE 
MORE THAN FOUR TIMES HIGHER 
THAN THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS. 
WE ARE PUTTING BIG EFFORT INTO 
FENTANYL AND OTHER DRUG 
SEIZURES. 
LAST YEAR WE INCREASED THE 
AVERAGE FEDERAL SENTENCE FOR 
DRUG TRAFFICKING TO ITS HIGHEST 
LEVEL SINCE 2013. 
WE ARE PUTTING A STOP TO 
ANOTHER DANGEROUS SUPPLY OF 
OPIOIDS, OVER PRESCRIBING 
DOCTORS. 
OVERPRESCRIBING. 
THEY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL. 
OVER THE PAST 20 MONTHS OR 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND 
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN 
SERVICES FRAUD STRIKE FORCE 
TARGETED A COMBINED$3.3 BILLION 
IN WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE 
RELATED TO THE UNLAWFUL 
DISTRIBUTION OF OPIOIDS. 
THAT'S BY FAR THE MOST EVER. 
THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF OPIOIDS 
BEING PRESCRIBED DECREASED BY 
NEARLY 20% IN A VERY SHORT 
PERIOD OF TIME. 
I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT. 
WE HAVE NEARLY DOUBLED FUNDING 
FOR OPIOID RESEARCH, INCLUDING 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF NONADDICTIVE 
PAINKILLERS. 
OVER THE PAST 20 MONTHS, OUR 
NATIONAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG TAKE 
BACK DAYS -- VERY IMPORTANT -- 
REALLY SOMETHING -- HAVE 
COLLECTED MORE THAN 2.7 MILLION-
POUNDS OF UNUSED OR UNWANTED 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. 
WE HAVE LAUNCHED ONE OF THE 
LARGEST AD CAMPAIGNS TO KEEP 
YOUNG AMERICANS FROM GETTING 
ADDICTED FROM THE FIRST PLACE. 
IF WE CAN DO THAT, THE ADS ARE 
SO IMPORTANT. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO BREAK AWAY 
FOR A MOMENT TO BRING IN CBS 
NEWS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, 
PAULA REID AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT 
DISCUSSING THE DISTURBING 
SITUATION TODAY WITH THE 
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES. 
HE SAID IN THESE TIMES WE HAVE 
TO UNIFIE. 
HE HAD AN INTERESTING TWIST. 
HE HAD HIS WIFE, MELANIA TRUMP, 
INTRODUCE HIM. 
THAT WAS UNUSUAL. 
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF HIS 
STATEMENTS? 
>> I DON'T THINK IT WAS UNUSUAL 
FOR THE FIRST LADY TO INTRODUCE 
HIM IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS 
EVENT ON OPIOIDS. 
THERE ARE MANY MEMBERS OF HIS 
ADMINISTRATION WORKING ON THIS 
ISSUE. 
IT MAY EXPLAIN WHY WE HEARD 
FROM HER EARLIER CONDEMNING 
THESE ATTACKS. 
SHE CONDEMNED THESE ATTACKS, AS 
MANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP 
FAMILY HAD. 
HERE HE OFFERED A MESSAGE OF 
UNITY AND AN UPDATE ON THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
THE MESSAGE OF UNITY, HE  SAID 
POLITICAL VIOLENCE HAD NO PLACE 
IN AMERICA. 
HE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS MEASURE 
HAS BIPARTISAN. 
HE DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS ANGRY, 
UPSET AND UNHAPPY. 
HE VOWED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM 
OF THIS. 
HE OFFERED AN UPDATE ON THE ON-
GOING INVESTIGATION. 
HE JUST COME OUT OF A BRIEFING 
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
AND THE FBI. 
THE EXPLOY SIEVES -- EXPLOSIVES 
ARE ON THEIR WAY ON THE 
ANALYZED. 
THERE IS A FULL INVESTIGATION 
UNDERWAY. 
I CAN TELL YOU THERE ARE MORE 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIM TO COME 
OUT AND CONTINUE THIS MESSAGE 
OF UNITY. 
OR TO GO IN ANOTHER DIRECTION. 
WE'LL KEEP SHOULD SEE HIM IN A 
FEW HOURS AFTER THIS EVENT AS 
HE MAKES HIS WAY TO A RALLY IN 
THE MIDWEST. 
HE SOMETIMES STOPS TO TALK WITH 
US REPORTER ON HIS WAY TO HIS 
HELICOPTER. 
THAT WILL BE A CHANCE FOR HIM 
TO TAKE QUESTIONS. 
THEN HE WILL HAVE A RALLY LATER 
ON TONIGHT. 
HAVE THE FLOOR WITH A 
SUPPORTIVE AUDIENCE. 
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 
IF HE STAYS ON MESSAGE. 
SO FAR THIS IS THE ONLY 
SOMETHING WE HEARD FROM HIM 
BESIDES HIS RE-TWEETING OF VICE 
PRESIDENT PENCE'S CONDEMNATION 
OF THE ATTACKS. 
YOU NEVER WANT TO GUESS WHAT 
THE WHITE HOUSE WILL DO. 
THERE WILL BE MORE 
OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTINUE THE 
MESSAGE OF UNITY AND BIPARTISAN 
OR GO IN ANOTHER DIRECTION. 
>> IT WAS HEARTENING TO HEAR 
HIM CALL FOR UNITY IN THESE 
DIFFICULT TIMES. 
THANK YOU, PAULA REID. 
>> IS THERE ANYTHING NEW YOU 
CAN TELL US ABOUT WHAT LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS 
DETERMINED FROM THESE DEVICES? 
>> Reporter: THEY ARE FINDING 
SIMILARITIES. 
IN THE SAMPLE THE POTENTIAL 
EVIDENCE IS GROWING. 
WE JUST REPORTED THAT 
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN MAXINE 
WATERS FROM CALIFORNIA, HER 
NAME WAS ON ONE OF THESE 
PACKAGES. 
IT WAS ADDRESSED TO HER. 
IT DID NOT MAKE IT TO HER 
OFFICE. 
IT WAS INTERCEPTED AT A 
CONGRESSIONAL MAIL FACILITY. 
AGAIN, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 
ADDS TO THE GROWING MOUNTAIN OF 
EVIDENCE THAT INVESTIGATORS 
HAVE. 
THIS IS WHAT SOME OF THESE 
DEVICES LOOK LIKE. 
THIS IS AN IMAGE THAT CBS NEWS 
HAS OBTAINED OF ONE OF THE 
DEVICES. 
WHAT IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF 
YOUR SCREEN IS THE POTENTIAL 
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE OR THE 
SUSPICIOUS DEVICE AND THE 
PACKAGING THAT IT CAME IN. 
ON THIS ONE, IMPARTICULAR, THIS 
ONE WAS ADDRESSED TO JOHN 
BRENNAN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR 
AND CNN. 
THE PACKAGE WAS ADDRESSED TO 
HIM. 
INVESTIGATORS HAVE INFORMATION 
TO GO ON. 
THEY CAN LOOK AT A PACKAGE LIKE 
THIS AND GATHER SOME CLUES FROM 
IT. 
EVEN POTENTIALLY GATHER SOME 
FINGERPRINTS THAT COULD 
EVENTUALLY LEAD THEM TO A 
SUSPECT OR SUSPECTS. 
THIS CASE BEGAN ON MONDAY THE 
WWW.THE SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE 
DELIVERED TO THE HOME OF GEORGE 
SOROS. 
THAT'S A LINK  WE ARE SEEING 
HERE. 
YOU KNOW HILLARY CLINTON, 
FORMER FIRST LADY AND FORMER 
SECRETARY OF STATE RECEIVED A 
PACKAGE. 
FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA. 
AND MAXINE WATERS. 
IF YOU ARE AN INVESTIGATOR AND 
LOOKING AT THE TRENDS. 
YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE LINKS. 
WHAT YOU SEE IS YOU HAVE A LINK 
TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OR 
PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 
ALSO, PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
CRITICAL OF THE PRESIDENT AND 
PEOPLE THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
CRITICAL OF. 
ALL OF THIS, YOU PUT IT 
TOGETHER AND IT GIVES 
INVESTIGATORS A LOT TO GO ON. 
IT IS THE JOINT TERRORISM PAST 
TASK FORCE LEADING THIS 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> I WANT TO SAY, WE CAN NOW 
CONFIRM THAT MAXINE WATERS HAS 
ALSO RECEIVED A PACKAGE, AS YOU 
REFERENCED THERE. 
DO YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PACKAGE 
GOVERNOR CUOMO RECEIVED. 
>> Reporter: HE SAID IN A 
BRIEFING HE RECEIVED A 
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE. 
WE'LL KEEP GOT WORD THAT WAS 
NOT THE CASE. 
WHAT HE RECEIVED WAS UNRELATED. 
>> VERY INTERESTING. 
WE HEARD HIM IN THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE SAYING I JUST NOW 
RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT I 
TOO, RECEIVED A PACKAGES. 
THEY JUST KEEP POPPING UP. 
IT IS UNKNOWN WHERE THE NEXT 
ONE MAY APPEAR. 
>> Reporter: THAT IS THE DANGER 
HERE. 
INVESTIGATORS WANT PEOPLE TO BE 
AWARE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING. 
THAT'S POTENTIALLY WHY YOU SEE 
THAT IMAGE LEAKING OUT TO THE 
PRESS. 
THEY WANT PEOPLE TO BE FAMILIAR 
WITH WHAT IS GOING ON. 
INVESTIGATORS ARE CONCERNED 
THERE ARE MORE POTENTIAL, 
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES OUT THERE. 
TO THIS POINT, NO ONE HAS BEEN 
INJURED. 
INVESTIGATORS WANT TO KEEP IT 
THAT WAY. 
>> IS THERE ANYMORE EVIDENCE OR 
ANY INDICATION OF WHERE THIS 
SUSPECT MAY BE LOCATED? 
WHERE THESE PACKAGES 
ORIGINATED? 
>> Reporter: ALL VERY GOOD 
QUESTIONS. 
I'M SURE INVESTIGATORS ARE 
LOOKING INTO THAT. 
THEY'LL HAVE HELP WITH THAT 
WITH ALL OF THESE SURVEILLANCE 
CAMERAS THAT THERE ARE AROUND 
THIS COUNTRY AT THIS TIME. 
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO USE SOME 
OF THAT SURVEILLANCE CAMERA 
FOOTAGE TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY 
LINKS OR IF THERE IS ANY SORT 
OF CLUE THAT THEY CAN GET FROM 
THAT. 
THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT THE 
COMPONENTS OF THESE SUSPICIOUS 
DEVICES TO FIND A LINK. 
WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN ANY 
INFORMATION TO THIS POINT OF 
ANY POTENTIAL SUSPECTS OUT 
THERE. 
INVESTIGATORS ARE WORKING HARD 
TO TRACK SOMEONE DOWN TO 
PREVENT THIS FROM ESCALATING TO 
A POINT WHERE SOMEONE GETS 
INJURED. 
>> THEY ARE NOT SAYING THIS IS 
OVER. 
EVERYONE CAN JUST RELAX. 
THIS IS AN ON-GOING SITUATION. 
>> Reporter: YEAH. 
THIS IS A TENSE, ON-GOING 
SITUATION. 
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW AT THIS 
POINT WHERE THE NEXT SUSPICIOUS 
DEVICE MIGHT POP UP. 
>> THEY HAVE NO FURTHER 
INFORMATION AS TO WHO MIGHT 
ALSO BE TARGETED? 
>> Reporter: THEY DON'T. 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE BEING 
ASKED TO HANDLE ANY SUSPICIOUS 
PACKAGE CAREFULLY. 
THE WORD IS GETTING OUT, NOT 
JUST TO AVERAGE JOES, BUT 
MEMBERS IN CONGRESS AND OTHER 
PEOPLE IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS. 
CLEARLY, WHOEVER IS BEHIND 
THIS, IS TARGETING PEOPLE WHO 
ARE FAIRLY PROMINENT PEOPLE. 
I THINK THAT'S FAIR TO SAY. 
AND PROMINENT ORGANIZATIONS, 
GIVEN WHAT WAS SENT TO THE TIME 
WARNER CENTER WHERE CNN IS HEAD 
QUARTERED. 
THERE IS ENOUGH INFORMATION 
THERE FOR INVESTIGATORS TO GET 
THE WORD OUT WIDE SO NO ONE 
MAKES THE MISTAKE OF 
MISHANDLING ONE OF THESE 
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES. 
>>  LET'S BRING IN RON HOSKO 
FROM WASHINGTON. 
WHAT IS THE NEWS THAT MAXINE 
WATERS RECEIVED A PACKAGE? 
>> Reporter: NOT A SURPRISE ON 
BOTH COUNTS. 
BOTH THAT SHE WAS A RECIPIENT 
OR INTENDED RECIPIENT. 
SECONDLY THAT THE PACKAGE ENDED 
UP AT THE MAIL PROCESSING 
FACILITY FOR CONGRESS. 
I THINK IT IS THE CAPITOL 
HEIGHTS IN MARYLAND. 
THAT'S A GOOD THING. 
CERTAINLY THE CAPITOL POLICE 
HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE 
THREAT HERE. 
HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE 
OF THEIR PARTICIPATION ON THE 
JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCES OF 
WHAT THESE PACKAGES LOOK LIKE. 
THEY CAN ALERT THEIR MAIL 
PROCESSORS THERE. 
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A PRETTY 
REFINED CAPABILITY TO INGEST 
THAT PACKAGE AND PROCESS IT SO 
IT GETS INTO THE EVIDENCE CHAIN 
WITH THE FBI FOR COMPARISON 
AGAINST THE OTHER DEVICES. 
THAT PROBABLY IS THE LEAST 
DISRUPTIVE OF THESE PACKAGES SO 
FAR. 
>> LET'S DO A COUNT NOW. 
ARE WE UP TO SIX CONFIRMED 
DEVICES? 
>> Reporter: SOUNDS LIKE THAT 
MAY BE A GOOD NUMBER. 
IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING TO 
FIND OUT THERE ARE MORE BY THE 
END OF THE DAY. 
>> IT TAKES A LOT OF SUSTAINED 
EFFORT AND ENERGY TO GET SIX 
DEVICES MADE AND OUT IN THE 
MAIL. 
THAT WOULD SUGGEST THIS 
INDIVIDUAL WAS DETERMINED. 
>> Reporter: UNQUESTIONABLY. 
LOOKING AT I FROM ANOTHER 
PERSPECTIVE, EACH DEVICE 
CREATES ANOTHER OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO RETRIEVE 
FORENSIC INFORMATION, WHETHER 
IT IS DNA, 
FINGERPRINTS, A FIBER, AN 
IMAGE, ALL OF THOSE REPRESENTS 
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT TO SUCCEED TO 
IDENTIFY THE OFFENDER. 
>> WHAT ABOUT THIS RETURN 
ADDRESS STRATEGY? 
WE CAN SEE THE RETURN ADDRESS 
OF ONE IS DEBBIE SCHULTZ. 
DOES THAT SUGGEST THE SENDER 
HAS A LITTLE BIT OF A SENSE OF 
HUMOR? 
>> Reporter: YEAH. 
THAT'S MY
