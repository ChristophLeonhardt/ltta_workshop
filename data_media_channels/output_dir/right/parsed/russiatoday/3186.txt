at RT we have a great team but we need
to strengthen before the FIFA World Cup
and who better than a legend to keep it
tight at the back
in 1992 then not qualify for the
European Championships at the very last
moment no one believed in us but we want
and I'm hoping to bring some of that
winning spirit to the RTT recently I've
had a lot of practice so I can guarantee
you that Peter Schmeichel will be under
best fall since my last World Cup I can
run that story thoroughly that was an
old joke I was only kidding here I come
Russia
right right right right no no left left
left more left
okay stop that's really good that
