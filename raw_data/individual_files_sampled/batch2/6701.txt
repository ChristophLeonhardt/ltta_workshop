AMERICAN AIRLINES IS APOLOGIZING AFTER ONE OF ITS FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ESSENTIALLY KICKED OFF TWO PRO BASKETBALL PLAYERS FROM A FLIGHT AFTER ACCUSING THEM OF STEALING BLANKETS FROM FIRST-CLASS. THE BASKETBALL PLAYERS ARE MARQUIS TEAGUE AND ALSO TRAHSON BURRELL, THEY ARE PLAYERS FOR A BASKETBALL TEAM I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH, THEY ARE IN AN NBA G LEAGUE, THEY ARE KNOWN AS THE MEMPHIS HUSTLE. THEY WERE ON THE FLIGHT, AND AS THEY WERE GOING TO THEIR SEATS IN THE ECONOMY AREA APPARENTLY SOMEONE IN FIRST CLASS GAVE THEM THEIR BLANKETS. AT THAT POINT A MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT, WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE BLACK, ACCUSED THEM OF STEALING THE BLANKETS, AND THEN AN ARGUMENT HAPPENED AND THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT SAID HE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND KICKED TO THE TWO OFF THE FLIGHT. I THINK HE LEFT. NO, HE ACCUSED THE TWO MEN OF THEFT AND FORCED THEM OFF THE PLANE. THE TWO PLAYERS WERE FORCED OFF THE PLANE, AND LATER APPARENTLY BECAUSE THIS STORY BECAME A HUGE DEAL, THE AIRLINE REALIZED THERE WAS A MISTAKE AND THAT THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY STEAL ANY BLANKETS, AND THEY WERE GIVEN TWO FIRST-CLASS SEATS ON A DIFFERENT FLIGHT TO GET TO THEIR DESTINATION. BUT LOOK, THE THING I THOUGHT WAS REALLY INTERESTING WAS THE IMMEDIATE ACCUSATION OF THEFT. WHY DID IT IMMEDIATELY GO THERE? I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND. FIRST OF ALL, SO THEY HAVE SOME BLANKETS. IF SOMEONE IN FIRST CLASS GAVE THEM THE BLANKETS THAT MEANS NO ONE EVER COMPLAINED ABOUT BLANKETS BEING STOLEN, YOU JUST SAW TWO PEOPLE WITH FIRST-CLASS BLANKETS AND IMMEDIATELY ASSUMED THEY WERE STOLEN EVEN THOUGH NO ONE COMPLAINED ABOUT ANYTHING. WHO CARES? THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE DOING AS A FLIGHT ATTENDANT, THAT'S WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT? WHETHER THESE PEOPLE HAVE BLANKETS? TWO PARTS OF THE STORY GET UNDER MY SKIN. ONE OBVIOUSLY IS THE AUTOMATIC ASSUMPTION HERE. WE KNOW THERE ARE STEREOTYPES AND OF COURSE THE LAST PART, AS ANA EXPLAINED TO ME, THEY GOT THROWN OFF THE PLANE BECAUSE HE FELT "UNSAFE." GET OUTTA HERE. YOU HAVE ULTIMATE POWER NOW IS A FLIGHT ATTENDANT. PEOPLE ABUSE THAT POWER LEFT AND RIGHT. I HAD A SLIGHT DISAGREEMENT WITH YOU, HA-HA, I WIN. I HAD A FRIEND WHO GOT THREATENED AT AN AIRPORT IN VEGAS THAT THEY WOULD NEVER LET HIM FLY AGAIN IF HE SPOKE UP AGAINST THEM. THEY CAN RUIN YOUR LIFE, PUT YOU ON A NO-FLY LIST, YOU CAN'T GIVE PEOPLE THAT KIND OF POWER. IT GOES TO THEIR HEAD AND YOU GET STORIES LIKE THIS. THE TREATMENT OF PEOPLE IN THE ECONOMY SECTION OF THE PLANE IS WHAT REALLY GETS TO ME. YES, THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY STOLE IS A HUGE PROBLEM, PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM IN THIS STORY, BUT I JUST DON'T GET WHY THAT STOOD OUT TO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT TO THE POINT WHERE HE FELT I NEED TO CONFRONT THESE PEOPLE BLANKETS. THEY HAVE BLANKETS, NO ONE COMPLAINED TO YOU ABOUT ANYTHING, LET IT GO. I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT ON THAT PLANE. THIS IS AMERICAN AIRLINES AGAIN, AMERICAN AIRLINES IN OCTOBER HAD THE NAACP ISSUE A TRAVEL ADVISORY AGAINST THEM SAYING THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS COULD FACE DISCRIMINATION IF THEY FLY WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES BECAUSE OF REPEATED INCIDENTS INCLUDING ONE INVOLVING AN ORGANIZER OF THE WOMEN'S MARCH WHO WAS BOOTED FROM A FLIGHT AFTER A DISPUTE OVER HER SEAT. SO FOR THE NAACP TO SAY WATCH OUT FOR AN AIRLINE, THEY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE, I'M NOT SURE I'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE. IN THIS CASE IT'S TWO BLACK GUYS DISCRIMINATED AGAINST FOR THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT WAS ALSO BLACK SO THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS HERE.
