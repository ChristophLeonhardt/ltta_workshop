his military is fiercely loyal to him that's what people leave out of all these conversations and the only way to get rid of a dictator who's military is fiercely loyal is to go in and to remove him and we already tried that in Iraq and it didn't really work out for us so in this case you know as terrible as he that's a great point let's go let's dissect that a little bit why is his military fiercely loyal it was it out of fear no the center's or is it out of he just maintain stability in the country for them why are they so loyal you you did that with these guys right these guys you were very very well how many of them were there in there with you there were 18 alright this is high-quality intelligence 18 soldiers why are they so loyal to well there are different reasons one is that they were all Alawis which is a Shia sect of Islam and you know the Sunnis hate them they hate them they're like 10% of the population in Syria Bashar Assad is an ally we sew it sew it you know if they if they lost their dictator they'd be facing genocide and basically you know yoni deportation and stuff like that was driving tribal it tribalism and personal survival prospects partially but a lot of his military is also Sunni like I may through a general and with us at one point who was a Sunni and he was fiercely loyal to him as well and that and that is where what you just said comes into play where it's like stability like they know that he brings a certain level of stability to the country without being too extreme so I mean what under Assad before all this happened you know women can walk around wearing makeup I sold alcohol they could smoke cigarettes you know what I mean they had you know basic freedoms that they know are gone the second you know the FSA or you know the extremists take over because let's face it the FSA takes over the extremists are going to bump them out and take over anyway so they know that it's it's either Assad or basically Baghdad or they turn into I they turn into Iraq right and daddy takes over exactly like him right somebody like him Kalani who was the head of al Nostra so it's it's either you've been with extremists or you have this guy Assad who let's face it he's not ideal but as far as we go and Industry logos the guy knows this place you know Israel flies in there every couple of what weeks months that's a bunch of jobs a bunch of bombs and goes home and he never does anything no yeah he talks tough but he doesn't want to toast enough but Israel but you know what's interesting is that you know you know he's a bad guy you know he gasses his own people you know he aligns with bad actors but I've got a friend guy who American guy but he's serially and very successful to that family both of his parents are doctors very very well-off he's an attorney he was born he had a sister were born here had brother but his parents are from Damascus and his mother was an Olympic swimmer and basketball player secular Muslim his dad was a Christian not only you know when they dated there was no problem right and he the country had been relatively stable his relatives only left when Isis started to grow they were living in Damascus they were physicians that hernias there were CPAs they were living very very well all Christian the Christian side of his family protected by Assad they had no product when Isis started to proliferate they didn't move to Dubai they were pretty well-off they had money stashed other places because the new Syria wasn't the most stable in terms of middle-east ability so they fled to Dubai but they said while they lived in the maskers they never felt in fear of their lives they only started to peel fear once Isis started to gain a foothold in the country and so it's a conundrum for the u.s. in many respects yes I mean these are facts that a lot of people don't know like Christians are more protected and they weren't only protected they were welcomed like in the in the coastal cities through takia and tattoos where most of the guys I was with her from you know they celebrate Christmas with their Christian neighbors the Alawis yeah the Heloise like like I got a text from my friend I leave I was locked up with I'm wishing me a Merry Christmas this year he's a soldier yeah he was a he's an ally and he's a soldier Halloweeny point 70 attacks we should be a Merry Christmas saying that you know we're celebrating right now because you know how Jesus was one of their prophets right right so they so they so they're very very open to that you know they have they say you know some of us have Christmas trees we love Christmas over here so yeah I mean they were very open-minded about stuff like that and you know it's a shame that more people don't know about it because you know maybe they'd be like all right you know what you're still a bastard this this is sad but you know what's the alternative there's really important stuff we want to bring it to you every day so help me
