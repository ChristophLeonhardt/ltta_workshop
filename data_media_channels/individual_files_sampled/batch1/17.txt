Northern Ireland remains the only part of the UK where it's illegal for female victims of rape and incest to have the resulting pregnancies terminated even in cases where the fetus has an unsurvivable abnormality abortion is still prohibited and in 2013 Sarah UITs first pregnancy turned from joy to despair at 19 weeks her skull had informed that her brain hadn't formed there was no way she was going to live independently and I couldn't go through for nine months trying to baby that I knew I wasn't gonna be able to take home five years after making the journey from Belfast to London to abort that pregnancy Sarah returned to London to the Supreme Court hoping to hear the judges strike down part of Northern Ireland strict abortion laws on human rights grounds the current law is incompatible with article 8 in cases of rape incest and fatal but not serious fetal abnormality but instead of deciding the issue once and for all for jurisdiction reasons the judges statements in this case are not legally binding so the pressure is intensifying on politicians to take action this issue is not going to go away Ireland is about to reform its law on abortion and therefore it will remain in the public eye in the months to come it's time we in Northern Ireland looked at our abortion laws and made sure that they are human rights compliant the complex legal and moral issues are further complicated by the devolved powers of Northern Ireland's parliamentary assembly an assembly which hasn't sat in session since January of last year devolution is not now nor has it ever been justification for the denial of women's rights there is no devolved government in Northern Ireland and ultimately responsibility rests with Westminster it is all eyes now on trees in May but anti-abortion campaigners insist the judges cannot approve killing every living human being has the right for that life to be protected so it's really quite shocking that the judges should come to it's a fundamental right to be born to be protected in from the moment of conception and we hope that our government will continue to uphold the rights of all citizens born and unborn make no mistake the issue of whether Northern Ireland's abortion laws comply with human rights legislation is going to come back before judges in the near future Paul Brennan al Jazeera of the Supreme Court in London
