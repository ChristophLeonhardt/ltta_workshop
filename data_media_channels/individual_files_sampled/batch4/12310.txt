like deep impact except if crisis had not been averted by the tax cut right the tax cut was going to end all human life on earth and that obviously has been happening the latest evidence that millions will die because of the Trump tax cuts comes courtesy of Apple run by Tim Cook hey lefty who said that they would now pay one-time tax of 38 billion dollars on their overseas cash holdings and ramped up spending in the United States as they seek to emphasize their contributions to the American economy after years of taking criticism for outsourcing manufacturing to China why because we changed our tax policy right now we've changed our tax policy the corporate tax rates or drop dramatically which means that now Apple doesn't have to outsource right all of its costs just went down for doing business in the United States they say they invest thirty billion dollars in capital spending in the u.s. over five years that would create more than twenty thousand jobs the total includes a new campus which initially is going to house technical support for customers they're calling missus Apple HQ to and right now there's an open competition among cities around the United States to get the new Apple headquarters it'll probably be in Austin Texas if anybody thinks it's gonna come to LA that's on their final list is LA they'd be fools to put this headquarters in La La's a for lack of a better term a bleep whole country I live here I get to say that okay the total includes a new campus and ten billion dollars toward data centers across the country it also will expand from 1 billion dollars to 5 billion dollars a funded established last year for investing in advanced manufacturing in the United States now one of the reasons that I think that this is good that Apple is announcing this is as I've been saying for months there's a difference between the government giving a company specific give away to places like Apple and making broad scale policy changes that have a good impact on Apple it's useful for companies to sound off publicly and say here are the policies that benefit my business so long as those policies are not specifically geared toward paying you off yeah that's not what this policy was designed to do Apple's thirty eight billion dollar tax commitment this corning The Wall Street Journal is the largest such sum announced in response to the major overhaul of the u.s. tax code president Trump signed into law late last year that law included an incentive for US companies to bring home offshore holdings with companies required to pay a one-time tax of fifteen point five percent on overseas profits held in cash and other liquid assets instead of them having to keep all of that money overseas instead they get to now bring that money home and invest it here in the United States these tax changes are very good obviously not the end of all life on earth so the so Tim Cook who is the the post Steve Jobs head of Apple was asked about all this he said some of this was planned already but some of it wasn't and the Trump tax cuts had something to do with it no there clearly let me be clear there there are large parts of this that a result of the tax reform and there's large parts of this that we would have done in any situation so it sounds like president Trump's tax bill has been a huge windfall for Apple well we - there are two parts of tax bill right there's a corporate piece in an individual case I do believe the corporate tax side will will result in job creation and a faster growing economy okay so again all of the talk about how this is the end of the economy everything was gonna go terribly it's nonsense the stock market is gained a thousand points in the last eight days consumer confidence is high as well it should be again a confidence in the economy is less based on the actual policy that the economy is currently sustaining it is more based on predictability in the economy if you're if you want a business right we've run a business here at daly wire one of the things that makes it very difficult to do business in the state of California is you don't know from day to day what exactly the state legislature in California is going to do that means that we have to think twice before we hire someone do we want to hire somebody simply to fire them I do want to hire somebody simply to have our profit margins cut arbitrarily by the state through tax regulation do we the same thing holds true in all areas of the marketplace the marketplace is always in flux that is why one I think it's George Gilder who talks about the idea that the economy a well-run economy should basically be like the static on a phone line right that the the job of the government is to make sure that that static is as low as possible there's a certain predictability to whatever hum is in the background the worst thing that can happen on a phone is not that they're static the dinners intermittent static you actually would prefer a low level of consistent static on a phone call to every so often you just lose the call for five to ten seconds because then you can't understand what anybody is saying it's the predictability of the economy that matters even more than the level of static in the economy so long as the level of static in the economy isn't it's some enormous rate where nothing can get done and it totally stagnates the economy now what's amazing about all of this is again the economy is doing really well the jobless claims aren't their lowest level now since something like 1973 so there's still problems in the economy in terms of people reintegrating into the economy after years of spending time out of the economy we're still paying too much in terms of people who are on unemployment insurance but the economy continues to to do really well and the Democrats are very upset about this people on the Left are very upset about this which goes to show you know when people like me said we wanted Obama to fail I said I think that rush limbaugh was right I wanted Obama to fail the reason I wanted Obama to fail was not because I wanted something bad for the country but because I thought I wanted his policies to fail I didn't want him as you know president to fail I would prefer that he embraced all the policies that I like do all those things in the country succeeds the reason I wanted Obama to fail is because he disagreed with all of my policies and he helped stagnate the economy the difference is people on the left are actually not happy when the economy does well right when the economies did well under under President Obama or did mediocre under President Obama I urged caution because I thought that his regulatory policy was really bad but I was quite happy that the economy was doing well you can see the difference Chris Matthews is very upset about this so he's back from vacation you remember there are a lot of accusations that Chris Matthews I don't know that's how you stay and playing hardball with female employees I've been yelling at them saying mean things to them wake in the morning those are they show and say stop and that was back he's on MSNBC with beardy McGee aired a lot don't know who this guy is and and Chris Matthews starts talking about how maybe it is a bad thing if the economy grows maybe it's bad for the merica if the economy grows because Trump or something I get this sense that one of the reasons the Dow Jones is going up it's generally good news but in this case I wonder if it is because what it means is all the stuff that we rooted for for the last 40 or 50 years the Clean Water Act the Clean Air Act all the things that good legislators like dead muskie got through are being term itíd to death are being killed by administrators who want the government to fail in its mission that's understand we need the regulations that kill the economy cuz it makes life better for so many Americans that's why the regulation is great and if it screws bunch of Americans and your stocks go down you eat your 401 K well huh I laugh at you and then I go buy another shoe to cut my hair with first of all I love that MSNBC actually has Chiron's like this right look at the chyron on this MSNBC clip I can just put up the freeze-frame here it's even worse than you think and then it just shows America on fire yeah they're not rooting for disaster or anything it's even worse than you think with the maricón fire well I didn't think it was that bad honestly I think that it's a lot better than you think I mean these people are crazy people talk about Trump derangement syndrome I mean this is full-on from foreign German syndrome I hope that the economy goes to hell so we can blame Trump for regulatory policy and it did this is comes from the same school of thought where people are very angry that in places like Seattle there are companies that now will say here is what your bottle of soda would cost here is what it cost with the soda tax and like doubles the price and they're very angry that people would make this clear or businesses that say here's what I'd be charging if I didn't have to pay my employees minimum wage bills l how dare are they people did this with Obamacare - okay reality suggests that when you get rid of regulations on businesses businesses do better sorry that reality does but that's just the reality but over on MSNBC they refused to recognize reality because reality is is oftentimes discriminatory of sexist racist bigoted etc okay so before we go any further we're gonna get to Trump's fake news Awards in just a second the fake Newsies and they were shall we say disappointment I was I was he should have just Rick Rolled everybody it would've been better but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors

much-ballyhooed fake Newsies now I was hoping okay if there's one thing that we could expect from this president one thing I think would be fair to expect from this president it is that if you're going to do a real TV show at least be good at it I mean my goodness The Apprentice is actually an entertaining show from like the one episode or half an episode I ever saw of it before turning out but the but you would expect it Trebek Trump has actually appeared at the Tony Awards or at the Emmy Awards and he actually did an entire number of green acres with Megan Mullaly I believe it was at the Emmy Awards and you can find this tape online of Trump singing Green Acres so I was hoping for some musical interludes from the president I wanted to hear him sing Moon River I thought that'd be great and he can actually do it by mooning the press during the fake Newsies Day Moon River wider than a mile and then just moon the press like yeah it could've been fantastic it could've been great all the way through none of that happen instead it turned out that he's sort of said that he was gonna give fake news Awards and then he just half-assed it another Moon River reference hey then he just didn't really do it properly he say tweeted out a link to the GOP comm website and the GOP comm website was basically like an article that you'd find a daily wire or Washington Examiner or the Federalist that listed like ten of the worst fake news stories of the of the of the year of 2017 he got some of them wrong right he suggested for example that CNN had edited remember we talked about on the air CNN made a big deal out of from dumping a bunch of fish food in the koi pond and it turned out that the the Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe a had actually done exactly the same thing a minute before but you didn't see that because the CNN camera had zoomed in on Trump and then people suggested that Trump was just a rude buffoon because he did it himself so that was on the list that they said that Siena had edited the tape falsely that wasn't really true there's plenty of fake news on the list though I mean again Chris Matthews suggesting that it's even worse than you think his fake news that of course is not true at all but he releases the fake Newsies and here are some of the winners we'll go through some of the winners what he said what first of all CNN came in and in first place there the Sally Field you like me you really like me of the fake Newsies the New York Times is Paul Krugman claims on the day of president Trump's historic landslide victory that the economy would never recover first of all I love that the that the Trump administration keeps trotting out the lie that this is a historic landslide victory it was not in fact a historic landslide victory he lost the popular vote by three mil and just to be accurate it is fake news that it was a historic landslide victory it was not a historic landslide victory it was a very very close election in she lost the popular vote in the electoral college he outpaced everyone but I think George W Bush in 2000 he was outpaced by every other election for the past 40 years except for except for W in 2000 which was a dead heat essentially then they put on ABC News's Brian Ross choked and cent markets into the downward spiral with false report that is indeed fake news the CNN reporting that Donald Trump in his son had access to hacked document from WikiLeaks that was fake news he's correct time reporting the Trump removed a bust of MLK from The Oval Office it wasn't really time it was a time reporter who tweeted it out then retracted it within a couple of hours just to be a little accurate here Washington Post reporting but the president sold-out rally in Pensacola was empty okay that should not make the top ten that's just it's week T okay it's like when crash won the Oscar for Best Picture that one really is not on the list but beyond that it wasn't the Washington Post that reported it again it was in Washington Post reporter who then walked that back with him I think in an hour of tweeting it out and then I mentioned the CNN video about the the feeding of the fish a CNN falsely reporting about Anthony Skinner mood she's meeting with the Russian and then retracting it due to a significant breakdown in process that was indeed a bad one Newsweek reporting the Polish first lady a gotta kornhauser Duda did not shake president Trump's hand I remember when the media did this I believe it was again a reporter for Newsweek not necessarily the publication itself although Newsweek is a garbage publication I mean today Newsweek has an article about how Hillary Clinton could still be president I am not kidding you and not that she's gonna win in 2020 like how she can still be president now how if they find collusion Hillary can still end up president what's their weird theory over at Newsweek I'm not joking about this is an actual thing their theory is that Trump would be forced to resign and then pence would be forced to resign and then Paul Ryan would assume the presidency and named as his vice president Hillary Clinton and then Paul Ryan would resign that's the actual argument Newsweek is making okay by that standard I could be president except that I'm not 35 right your dog could be president by that standard Paul Ryan could could grab gene Simmons the frontman from kiss and make him president by that standard and then this is but when let me talk about the media being insane and then Trump saying fake news a lot this is why Trump says fake news a lot is because there is indeed a lot of fake news and also because let's be real about the narrative here the fake news narrative arose originally because the media needed an explanation for why Hillary Clinton had lost and because they felt that they had not been successful in elevating her to the president so if the media felt they've been overcome what couldn't overcome them well couldn't have been that people just didn't believe them it couldn't believe that it couldn't been that people didn't believe their narrative it had to be that there was some nefarious fake news out there that people were paying attention to now there's a difference between narratives that are false or legit fake news like pizza gate and then stuff that the media believe is fake news like people talking about uranium one can uranium one is actually questionable it's actually questionable like there's a guy who's indicted the other day for stuff that had to do with uranium moines so the idea that that everything in the media disagree with on a narrative level is fake news it is mirrored now by the Trump administration saying everything they disagree with on a narrative level is fake news and then let's see what else is on the list CNN reporting that former FBI director Comey would dispute Trump's claim he was told he's not under investigation the New York Times falsely claiming on the front page that the Trump administration hidden climate report that was indeed a bad moment for the New York Times so the newer Times got two of these of these ten the CNN got four so CNN definitely I mean it's like gone with the wind they swept the Oscars they swept the fake Newsies and then finally everyone Russia collusion you knew they were gonna have to put this on the list last but not least Russia collusion Russian collusion is perhaps the greatest hoax perpetrated on the American people there is no collusion all caps okay I agree that there's not a lot of evidence of collusion at this point to say it's perhaps the greatest hoax perpetrated on the American people in history when you'd probably have to put like the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution up there maybe and I mean if you're on the Left you'd have to say the argument on weapons of mass destruction in the Iraq war Russian collusion and I'm not sure that that how about the lie that blacks weren't people for like a hundred and fifty years now that I think that probably a pretty big hoax how about the hoax that's it currently existing since the 1960s the babies in the womb aren't babies they're instead magical kill creatures that you can just get rid of with no moral consequence but that is what it is so what's hilarious about this is that this comes out and everybody is really celebrity for just a second like we're all really excited maybe it's actually to be a tape of Trump in a tuxedo with a glass of champagne announcing the fake Newsies it would've been amazing you're an amazing I mean the troll possibilities would've been incredible and if you're not gonna troll well then as I say you might have gone with the pure rickroll I should have actually just sent people to actual video of Rick Astley singing never gonna give you up which would've been also amazing but instead we sorted out the second-rate Oscars I mean it's like it's like those years when they they weren't using Billy Crystal and they also weren't using Johnny Carson and so they just had like this bunch of randos in the middle there's a bunch of people who you never heard of hosting the Oscars and it was really like why am i watching this that was kind of what the fake news he's turned out to be but what's hilarious about this is that there's this image that's being promulgate by the left and this one is I would say if not fake news fake narrative that Trump is the most dangerous president ever that he's SuperDuper dangerous he's dangerous to press freedoms and this being helped along by people like Jeff like the senator from Arizona I agree with a lot of flex critiques of Trump's language on the press but the idea that Trump is a legitimate danger to the press the guy's not a legitimate danger to I mean the only thing he's a legitimate danger to is a Big Mac I mean the President of the United States is not capable of taking down the press I mean if the last look at MSNBC's ratings okay the idea that President Trump is doing severe damage to the institution of the press he's prosecuted fewer people in the press by a longshot than the Obama administration did he's been far more transparent nationally with the press than the Obama administration was this is not to compliment his handling of the press I think it's really dumb three quarters of the time but there's this idea that that he's some crazy authoritarian who's about to shut down the press now listen his language was Bogart to the press it does give impetus to people who feel like he's not gonna call out anti press activity in foreign countries that's an actual danger to foreign press but in the United States the idea that the New York Times on the verge of shutting down that they're the failing New York Times because he says failing New York Times is just a figment of their imagination so Jeff Flake who wants to run for president in 2020 a primary Trump and then force everybody into this this awkward primary situation flake gave a speech yesterday on the floor of the Senate now I'll be honest I kind of like speeches on the floor of the Senate that has to do with broad topics because this is what the Senate is for nobody showed up for it though and I mean you can see all the empty seats behind him you like no one cared except for the press which made a huge deal out of it here is flake talking about the authoritarian impulse sir president it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Joseph Stalin to describe his enemies it bears noting that so fraught with malice was a phrase enemy of the people that even Nikita Khrushchev bate it's use telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of quote and nya lading such individuals unquote who disagreed with the supreme leader this alone should be the source of great shame for us in this body especially for those of us in the president's party for they are shameful repulsive statements this feedback loop is disgraceful mr. president okay so I agree with the idea that a lot of what trump says on these topics is really ridiculous but the idea that the etherion the authoritarian impulse is what's the animating America that we've reached the end of America that fascism is upon us listen I am very much afraid of tribalism I'm afraid that that is that we are getting close order to that point under under President Trump but the idea that we are really threatened by the fake Newsies you know the president is not you got to make a choice Democrats is the president ineffectual or is the president a true danger to Western civilization you can't have it both ways and I think that as I've said since the beginning there's a strong case to be made that the President of the United States you ought to attribute to incompetence rather than malice most of the stuff that he does that you don't like because that just seems more honest to me okay so in just one second we are going to talk about let's talk about this immigration fallout for just a second so the the latest from the hill is that the president is being a bit effectual the President of the United States you just undermined everything that his own party is doing so right now there's a big debate happening over a government funding so the government has to get funded I believe by Friday or we enter a government shutdown territory now I'm a person who doesn't care about government shutdowns you're probably a person who doesn't care about government shutdowns if you think you care about government shutdowns it's because you don't know what a government shutdown is mandatory government services continue you are still going to get your Social Security checks you're still going to be you're still going to be but then the military will continue to be funded now the the military ops will continue the government will stay open right this is why when there was a big government shutdown in 2013 the the Obama administration had a manufacturer crisis they did say they had to shut down open air monuments right things where there wasn't any guard there they just shut them down to show you that if the government isn't operating you can't visit this rock in this park here so the idea that government shutdowns and the world is silly but everyone wants to avoid it because it's a it's a press manufactured crisis and politicians believe it because they think most important people on planet earth so the way this is operating is that Republicans are saying here's what we want we want a short-term continuing resolution it'll continue to fund the government for 30 days it won't be a brand new budget or anything and in order to get this passed we are not going to include anything with regard to daca so we're not going to solve the the issue of the dreamers we're not going to say that they can stay we're not going to renew their their quasi green cars we're not going to do any of that that's a separate negotiation we just want to fund the government and in order to sweeten the deal and get Democrats on board we are going to sign into law a six-year extension of the children's health insurance program now the children's health insurance program is a federal program by which the federal government basically subsidizes states to take care of underaged minors who don't have sufficient health insurance it's basically an expansion in expansion of Medicaid on the federal level I actually have some problems with chip not because I think the government doesn't necessarily have a role here but because I think the federal government doesn't necessarily have a role here if states are going to shoulder the burden or local communities are going to shoulder the burden of what to do with children who are underinsured that makes a lot more sense I'm a local list at heart I don't know where the federal government finds the authority in the Constitution to spend billions upon billions of dollars on any of these social programs and that includes even ones that I think are doing good things like like chip for example but it's a very popular program it's obviously going to be remanded all of that Republicans have been trying to reman date it since October Democrats refused to go along with it because they want some strings attached so right now the Republicans are proposing that we go forward with this that we go forward with this temporary funding this continuing resolution no cuts as always because as I've said many times on the show no one has an interest in cuts everyone has an interest in spending the Democrats are saying though they are not going to vote for the continuing resolution now there's some budget Hawks on the Republican side saying listen we want some cuts you want to do this continuing resolution stuff we want cuts this would be the house freedom caucus we need something in return for continued funding of the government and so that is leaving Republicans a little bit short of a majority and no Democrats are jumping on board because they want the government to shut down because they think that Trump will be blamed for a government shutdown the reality is that it's a little more complex than that Democrats could sign up for this continuing resolution and fun chip but they're not going to do that so the Democrats are very frustrated by this tactic even though this is the same tactic they've been using for years it's one of the reasons by the way I oppose omnibus budgets and omnibus packages because it basically allows you to take a a a sweetmeat you know put something good in a sandwich that's a crap sandwich and then say if you don't vote for this crap sandwich you're voting against the children and if you don't like this continuing resolution you're voting against the children this is why I don't like these omnibus packages I do think that everything should be voted on individually and funded individually you shouldn't be able to pass a bill that isn't funded and everything that you fund should be passed on an individual level so we can determine whether it's something that is good or something that is bad that's an ideological level but what the Republicans are trying to do at this point is get past the government shutdown in order to do that they're using chip as a certain amount of leverage against Democrats are saying listen you don't vote for the continuing resolution you're voting down your opportunity can to continue the longest extension of chip funding in American history so naturally the Democrats are really peeved about all of this and they say well you know you guys should just fund chip separately why are you connecting the the why you're connecting all of the funding in the continuing resolution to all of this all of this chip funding why arms putting data in there the Republicans on the contrary are saying listen you want the chip funding let's just pass continuing resolution we're good to go only one problem President Trump has a Twitter account so president Trump tweets out today quote chip should be part of a long-term solution not a 30 day or short-term extension maybe he doesn't understand how this works that's the Democrat talking point but the Democrats are saying that they want chip to be part of a long-term budget deal not part of the continuing resolution because they're trying to extract concessions from Trump and team so Senator John Cornyn actually had to tweet out at the president exactly what they were doing trying to explain to him via Twitter how this works and by the way it is a hundred percent true that the president is coached more by Twitter and by Fox News than he is by people who are inside the White House okay it is 100% true that the most powerful Steve in America was never Steve ban and it was always Steve Doocy right Fox and Friends which is you know I think a a good informative show there's no question that the President of the United States watches Fox and Friends and then makes decisions I mean you can see how he live tweets Fox and Friends I mean he really does it a lot now all of that said is this gonna make a huge difference not really but it is demonstrative of the fact that if you're gonna pose Trump as some sort of nefarious evil doctor evil figure he doesn't know the hell's going on guys I mean let's be real about this in policy terms in the last three weeks has done this three times three he did it on immigration remember he did this in the in the meeting with Democrats he started saying the dianne feinstein's idea of taking daca off the table of solving daca and then doing comprehensive immigration reform he said yeah let's do that it's time to clean tackle bill and then Kevin McCarthy had a step and go uh mr. president no different oh yeah that's a minute when I said yes it meant no right so there was that and then last week there's a FISA Act renewal that was up when the administration position is that FISA should not be weakened and at least with regard to surveillance a foreign subject and then Trump tweeted out because he was watching Judge Napolitano on Fox and Friends that we should weaken FISA sending the entire thing into disarray and we have this in disarray and now immigration is in disarray so Mitch McConnell the Senate Majority Leader is just utterly bewildered as to what Trump wants at this point he says listen we are happy to support an immigration deal as soon as we find out what the hell Trump is talking about because I mean let's be what like I don't know yeah I'm looking for something that President Trump supports and he's not yet indicated hmm what measure he's willing to sign as soon as we figure out what he is for then I would be convinced that we were not just spinning our wheels going to this issue on the floor but actually dealing with a bill that has a chance to become law and therefore solve the problem so there's McConnell saying I don't know okay that's not great I mean it's not great for the policy of the United States when the president's own party is trying to is scratching their head going with a majority in Congress going well your guess is as good as mine guys now is this a little bit of it a little bit of push for McConnell yeah I mean McConnell knows deep down that he could pass out anything in trouble sign it Trump hasn't exercised his veto I think one time in his entire presidency so the idea that that McConnell will pass anything and then Trump will sign it is silly I think what what McConnell's trying to do politically here is avoid blame if he gets a bad deal and Trump signs it then Trump will just blame him I'll say listen I just signed the deal they brought to me I wasn't a part of the negotiation and McConnell's trying to throw it back on Trump saying dude give me something to work with here and Trump is like I don't know no you're on your own so this it's been a lot of fun to watch the president fighting with his own party again this does give the lie to the idea that Trump is some

subscribe at all these places and leave us a review which always helps us we are the largest fastest-growing conservative podcast in the nation all right I'll get back to immigration a little bit but first I want to talk about the the me to movement and Trump and porn stars and all sorts of good stuff so let's start with let's start with Trump important stars so as I mentioned yesterday there's a 5,500 word interview that's about to break from a woman named what what is her name now Daniels her name is stormy Daniels which is always a great way to come up with a porn name right just come up with a come up with a weather condition followed by a first name right is so so cloudy Ryan write it over it over here to be over overcast Bob and not the greatest porn and that one that one probably I can get higher but but in any case but in any case the this porn star supposed to give an interview in which she fully describes the president in the boudoir which I mean frankly this is the first time Trump is ever not wanted as happen when he back in the 1980s Trump used to pose as a guy named John Miller he'd get on the phone with reporters be like hey guys this is John Miller they'd be like is this title true it no no it's not I just had sex with a supermodel Nick really which super mouth that kind of the Bruni she was amazed and they'd go to Carla Bruni really I'm no idea this guy is or what the hell he's talking about and then be like well Trump says that he's the best sex anyone ever had right John Miller says it I know this John Miller guy sounds exactly like Trump but you know he says that he's unbelievable in bed Carla Bruni what do you say she's like I don't know I thought so it's been it's been great Trump literally used to call up tabloids and brag about the people he was dating and he wasn't dating like 3/4 of them now he's paying women to shut up so apparently in 2016 he paid stormy Daniels who's obviously he was obviously into her because of her hire in selecting conversational ability she is a is a important important star she has sex for money on camera so obviously of high quality and the president has a particular taste in women overall and so she is supposed to give a 5500 more to interview in which she also describes I guess the 2011 interview they're now releasing in which she describes the president's genitals which is just the only person in America excited about this is Marco Rubio to find out whether his theories about hands eyes were in fact correct um but the but all of this is happening and no one cares hey this is the funny thing no one cares so I'm old enough like this week was the 20th anniversary bursaries of the Lewinsky scandal in which the President of the United States had a consensual affair with the 21 year old intern and everyone went nuts I was there I remember it everyone thought what an immoral piece of garbage this Bill Clinton is now have a President of the United States who is supported by 80 percent of evangelical Christians and has sex with porn stars well he is married to another woman who he was having sex with while he was married to another woman who he was having sex with while he was married to another woman I can follow this inception like sex life okay by the time you get to the original level of the dream all that is that you're an old man waiting in pain and despair in any case the no one cares right no one cares like you don't care I don't care no one cares so here's why no one cares okay here's my theory of President Trump in economics there's something called the efficient market hypothesis the efficient market hypothesis is a is a hypothesis that suggests you cannot beat the stock market so all of these people who tell you that if your day trade and you find the inefficiencies in the market you can make millions right all these people are selling programs to you online about this is how you beat the market you cannot beat the market this is the efficient market hypothesis the reason being there are literally millions of people who spend their day analyzing every bit of information that is coming out from every single company and then that is priced in right it's baked into the cake it's baked into the cake and so stock market shocks usually happen when there's a change in government policy or and there's a downturn in government policy and new information is added to the system that's why the market goes up and down but the idea that you can beat the market because you know the market better than anybody else is just not true the evidence for the efficient market hypothesis is that if you take the people who are the top hedge fund managers at any given point if you take the people who are the top stock pickers at any given firm in one year by the next year the chances are that they are actually the lowest on the totem pole right people there's the chances that somebody remains the best stock picker ten years in a row is almost nil people tend to bounce around a lot so they'll have one great year and if they're lucky that great years where they spent the most money and bought the most stock or sold the most stock and then they'll have five really crappy years because there'll be regression to the mean and this is true if you actually look at the performance of studies suggestion is you're better off investing in stock indices than you are in stock picking and that is traditional kind of common knowledge in the stock community and an investment community if you ask somebody for investment advice this is typically what they will say one of the big one of the big firms like Goldman Sachs they'll tell you taking her money stick it in the stock market leave it there that's why Warren Buffett didn't lose a lot of money in the stock market in 2007-2008 because he continued buying stock right my stock plan just so the folks know is that I buy a certain set amount of stock every month rain or shine it does not matter I tend to buy a higher risk stock there's like a basket of higher risk stocks I tend to pick because I can afford to lose some money if I lose some money I'm 33 or now I'm 34 my birthday was this week so you can so I can afford to lose a little bit money and then make that money back but what I do is I'm constantly buying stock and I never sell stock right I just never sell it because if you hold on to it the good news is if the market goes down I just bought really cheap and if the market goes down I didn't sell really cheap so my stock portfolio is always going up so long as overall the market is going up that's the basic idea of the stock market in the efficient market hypothesis there are a few different versions there's the strong efficient market hypothesis which suggests legitimately you cannot beat the market and then there is the semi strong version of the efficient market hypothesis which suggests that publicly available information you can't beat the market but insider information it could be the market the strong efficient market hypothesis says even insider information is priced in because there are people who are inside these companies trading stock of these companies so the information is going to come out anyway that's actually the case against having insider trading trading laws they're a bunch of libertarians who believe insider trading laws are actually negative because they prevent like if I know daily wire is going down the tubes I'm going to sell my stock that's a hint to everybody else that they should sell their stock to yours if I were prevented from using my knowledge about daily wire then that would prevent the market from knowing the knowledge that's the case for insider trading so there's strong the semi-strong the weak the weak basically says that you might be able to defeat the market on an occasional basis but you're not gonna be able to do it very often essentially here's my theory about Trump here's what I'm talking about this my theory about Trump is a strong efficient market hypothesis there is no information none that changes your view of Trump none zero literally anything anything in the world could happen that President Trump could do or it could be said about him or there could be a report about him and nothing could change people's views of the President of the United States because it's all baked into the cake now and this is actually his strength and it's also his weakness right his weakness is that is very hard to convince people that you're somebody that you're not and everybody has a strong opinion on you the strength is that when you're when you're hit by pornstar was was paid off to the tune 130 grand and twenty sixty nobody goes yeah but he's already baked in that was already information that we already knew we already knew who this guy was character is the efficient market hypothesis we already know Trump's character everybody already has a judgement and evangelical Christians are gonna say listen I know the guy's a scumbag when it comes to his personal sexual morality did I did I ever pretend otherwise like we already knew that but King David I mean come on King David was just like that or that will say but that's that's the worst version ran it's the Jerry Falwell Jr version then there's the secondary version which is yeah I know the guy's been a douche bag but at least he's trying to stop abortion right I mean he's gonna speak this week in good Trump news he's gonna speak this week at the March for life or he's gonna go to the Rose Garden and give an address and then appear on the big screens at them at the March for Life hey the guy's defending my priorities so even if he's sticking his wing wing in places I wouldn't right then so what rights baked into the cake so there's a whole after I issued this efficient-market hypothesis theory yesterday online there are a whole group of people trying to debunk it Jonathan last over at the Weekly Standard was saying is there anything Trump can do like for example what if he selected some bad liberal judges and what I said is no that's already priced in the market all that will happen is his supporters will say listen he wanted to appoint a conservative but the Republicans just are too they're too weak need in their support for him he had to find a way to compromise and move to the middle so he can win reelection right they'll make an excuse in other words had what if Trump committed murder right let's take his theory he shot someone on Fifth Avenue most people in his base would say I probably deserved it right most people who don't like him would say you know what resident Trump spent 71 years on this earth not shooting people you think you just shoot somebody for no legitimate reason at all that means valo we all know who he is we all know who he is is the efficient market iPod the problem is that if this is true in politics if my theory is correct that there is a strong efficient market hypothesis that applies to characters like Trump but doesn't apply to cleaner characters it's a serious problem for our politics if you cannot change or a view of a man based on new evidence if your judgment of his character is so set in stone that nothing can change it right if I'm the site of people like me who think that he's deficient in character if Trump made an open confession of all of his sins and decided to turn over a new leaf and started talking like a statesman could I change his in my position on his character if the answer is no then I'm so set in my ways to problem the problem is this let's say somebody good Mitt Romney runs for president the strong efficient market hypothesis no longer holds right any piece of information about him will change people's minds because he's seen as clean the cleaner you are the less is baked into the cake people do not give good people the benefit of the doubt they give bad people the benefit of the doubt because they already knew they were bad if you are good everyone wants to see it come down a peg so if you're Mitt Romney and you're basically you know personally a saint I mean it's Mitt Romney is about as good a person as run for president of the United States and then anything comes out about you anything right you strap two dogs the top of your car it's the end of the world and suddenly it's a new piece of information in the market and you start pinging pawing around in the polls and so there's something to be said for the idea that Trump is stable not because he's a stable genius but because everybody has essentially made up their mind about him and nothing is going to change okay which brings us to the me to the latest on me too so there's a tweet that went out in the continuing collapse of me too this is just another episode Amber Tamblyn who's an actress apparently a nice person from people who know her she she was talking about this case that was reported by babe we've been talking about it for three days now this insane piece reported by babe in which a woman I had sex with his ease I'm sorry or oral sex a couple of times those ease I'm sorry and then suggested that she had a bad time and that this was somehow sexual abuse or sexual assault she was ripped by Ashleigh Banfield on CNN on HLN here's Ashleigh Banfield going after Ansari's accusers saying like listen you got to have some standard for what counts for sexual abuse here or we're just talking about nothing and now here is where I am going to claim victim you have chiseled away at a movement that I along with all of my sisters in the workplace have been dreaming of for decades a movement that has finally changed an oversexed professional environment that I too have struggled through at times over the last thirty years in broadcasting if you're lucky there's a really good chance that you're not going to experience the toxic work environment that the rest of us have endured and that is because of the remarkable progress being made against the Harvey Weinstein's and the Kevin Spacey's of the world the me2 movement has righted a lot of wrongs and it has made your career path much smoother and here's where I'm guessing it's gonna be a long career path you're 23 what a gift okay so she's talking about the reporter who reported all of this and she's saying listen you you you're basically destroying the me2 movement and there's truth to this so Amber Tamblyn tweeted out she actually tweeted out I had dinner with a woman who told me a brutal story about being coerced into sex by a very famous guy awful after seeing how the woman who spoke about out spoke out about Ansari is being treated she decided not to share her story publicly let this lose you some sleep tonight Twitter what why'd you just come out and talk about it like the problem here is not that people are siding with rapists like Harvey Weinstein or sexual abusers like Kevin Spacey or any of these people the problem is that this lady's story about as he's on sorry did not wash right that was the store that was the problem she got naked in his apartment praval intently performed oral sex on him twice and then suggested that she had given him no signals okay there's another signal being given there but again this is this this idea that all stories have to be believed on the most objective level it's the end of me too and then here's the funniest thing so Katie way is the name of this reporter so Katie Way decided that she was going to that she was going to respond to Ashleigh Banfield and she was asked to go on Ashleigh Banfield show here's the letter she wrote which is just insipid quote it's an unequivocal note from me the way your colleague Ashley someone I'm certain no one under the age of 45 has ever heard of by the way ripped into my source directly was one of the lowest most despicable things I've ever seen in my entire life shame on her shame on HLN Ashley could have talked to me she could have talked to my editor my publication but instead she targeted a 23 year olds woman and one of the most vulnerable vulnerable moments of her life someone she's never effing met before for a little attention I hope the ratings were worth it I hope the 500 retweets on the single news write-up made that burgundy lipstick bad highlights second wave feminists have has been feel really relevant for a while she disgusts me and I hope when she has more distance from the moment she has enough of a conscience left to feel remotely ashamed doubt it but still must be nice to piggyback off of the fact that another woman was brave enough to speak up and add another dimension to the societal conversation about sexual assault grace wouldn't know how that feels because she never struck out into this alone because she the bravest person I've ever met really and then you should meet a soldier I would never go on your network I would never even watch your network no woman my age would ever watch your network I will remember this for the rest of my career I'm 22 and so far not too shabby actually a little shabby and I will laugh the day you fold if you could let Ashley know I said this that she's no-holds-barred the reason it'd be a real treat for me thanks Katie the feminist movement doing itself all sorts of favors by ripping other women who are in favor of me - as burgundy lipstick bad highlighted second way of feminist has been well done Katie Way just geniuses over there at the meeting movement and then they wonder why people are failing to take it particularly seriously maybe it's because of all this nonsense from the third wave of feminists okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so in things I like my friend Jordan Peterson who is really terrific he was being interviewed on I believe was CBC the Canadian Broadcasting Company and he was asked by one by this interviewer about why he does not use the the gender the the gendered pronouns that transgender people would appreciate and this interview goes very very poorly for the interviewer I mean this one is like this one goes under Peterson destroys on YouTube it's just hideous here we go why should your rights to freedom of speech Trump a trans person's right not to be offended because in order to be able to think you have to risk being offensive I mean look at the conversation we're having right now you know like you're certainly willing to risk offending me in the pursuit of truth why should you have the right to do that it's being rather uncomfortable well I'm I'm very glad I put my you get my point there's like you're you're doing what you should do which is digging a bit to see what the hell's going on saying that is what you should do but you're exercising your freedom of speech to certainly risk offending me and that's fine I think more power to you as far as I'm concerned you haven't sat there and I'm just right I've just trying to work that out I mean ha gotcha ok so yes that is a bad moment for because this is obviously true every political conversation I've ever had about these subjects as always why should what you want to say Trump my right to not hear you say it like because that's the definition of freedom of speech and we can't have a conversation unless I'm actually telling you what I think but this is it this is how dumb the left is that they actually think that I'm supposed to manufacture what I believe in think in order to please particular people which is the opposite of an honest political conversation ok time you know what we can skip the thing that our production crew spent so much time cutting and go directly into things that I so here let's do a couple of things that I hate here so we begin with human nature I hate it ok so that here's the thing about human nature there is a story that is out today from Daily Mail and it's it's sort of hilarious so basically at the time that in Hawaii people thought they were going to be nuked into the earth right then they thought they were all going to die because a North Korean nuclear missile the traffic on porn sites dropped dramatically make sense you only have half an hour to live you probably have better things to do then then spend it with one hand occupied right you actually are going to are going to hopefully make peace with your God talk with your family you know watch that watch that season finale of cheers whatever it was that you were going to do it's probably not gonna be spent on a porn site here's the problem immediately after the Alert ends immediately after the alert ends porn sites it's a 50% increase in traffic from Hawaii after the ballistic missile threat was revealed to be false right so in other words in the shadow of death people like well this is probably a bad idea to be on this porn site right now like my wife walks in right now my life is just gonna end in a variety of terrible ways and then as soon as it they're like you know maybe I'll make peace with my god it's time to repent it ends like okay I'm back on on wackadoodle calm right I mean this is just it's it's an astonishing statement about what people feel when they are under pressure and it's one of the reasons why religion is necessary is to remind you on a daily basis you're gonna die okay I think that's a V T dark about this but there will be a time for you and at that time you might think back on your life and think you know if I spend hours a day in front of a computer looking at images of women who are acting for my benefit rather than you know doing meaningful things and that would be good but we have a unique capacity as human beings to put that out of our minds that we can waste hours a day online looking at naked people doing things to each other human nature not the best place one of the reasons why civilization is required okay final thing that I hate so everything is art now legitimately everything is art now I've hated the definition of art this way because if art is everything that art is nothing one of my favorite stories about this is there was a modern art museum I believe is in San Francisco where some guy went into the modern art museum took off his glasses put them on the floor and then stood there and started taking pictures of it and within minutes a crowd of people had gathered around to take pictures of this guy's glasses on the floor because they thought that it was an exhibit right because this is where art has gone well the latest indicator of art might be over we may be past the days of Michelangelo and an art may be dead like Rembrandt maybe maybe beyond us they've now created a vibrator art yes that's right now they have Mickey they they have digitally charted female orgasm and they have made art projects out of this which is a really weird thing to hang around your house I mean like your kids are walking around you're like mommy what's that well that was September 11 2013 as greatest night of my life like then just kind of weird and so here is this idiot video like oh my god I hope the world well I hope to god that we don't get hit by a nuclear missile and this is what I died talking about because really that would just be terrible this vibrator turns her orgasm into art is what this video says the women-led team at lioness created a new vibrator with special sensors that detect stimulation on the way to climax and present it on a chart in the lioness app and we never talked about sex I wanted to create a vibrator that could empower women to learn more about their own bodies I like that people think they invented orgasm like now like it hasn't existed for the last several hundreds of thousands of years orgasm in the West did I miss that okay the feature is available to app users in the spring just just wonderful stuff the I suppose that for men and then the next the next invention will be will be the will be fart art they'll actually be able to chart your your physical responses in real time to a passing gas and that will now be considered a high form of art again I'm not sure this is any worse than Karen Finley getting naked and smeared chocolate on her body or people who have done enema art which has been a thing in art schools for literally years but it doesn't demonstrate that we may be in the decadent phase of capitalism we may be in the decline and fall of the Roman Empire here when we are literally starting companies to sell vibrators so that you can be solipsistic enough to look at a digital imaging of your orgasm my goodness I wonder why society is on the ropes I just can't understand it okay we'll be back here tomorrow with much much more hopefully much much less of that we'll be back here with with more tomorrow now I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Glover executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer
