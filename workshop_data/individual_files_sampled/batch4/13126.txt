so before I went on vacation I received an email that I wanted to respond to but that I didn't have a chance I ran out of time so I thought there's no reason why I can't go back and respond to it now so that's what I'm going to do alright here's what it says Matt you are constantly giving God credit for good things that happen but I noticed that you never blame him for all the evil in the world if your God exists and he is good as you claim how do you explain a world filled with rape murder torture terrorism sex trafficking and so many other evils it's clear to me that there is no evidence for any kind of God there especially is no evidence for a good God all right so this is the classic why do bad things happen to good people objection and I think it's a good and important and complex question and it's one that Christians I've been talking about and debating and writing about for centuries since the beginning I also think it's kind of a weak argument against the existence of God and so it's a it's a good question to talk about I don't think it's a great argument against you know in the on for the atheists I don't think it's a good argument in the atheist corner I also think that my friend here in the email didn't even use the best version of his own argument he made the same oversight that a lot of atheists surprisingly make when it comes to this objection which is they use the weakest version of it so let's unpack it and we'll start with this there are two forms of bad things that might happen to a person just broadly speaking right there are two categories of bad things that happen in the world there's the kind of bad thing that the email described which is rape murder and so on things that are the result in other words of human choices if you're the victim of rape or murder that is the result of the choice of not yourself but somebody else the person who is victimizing you then there are the bad things that may happen to you as a result of your own choices and then there are the bad things that happen to you as the result of a combination of your own choices and the choices of other people so take for example a man who commits a crime goes to jail and then is murdered in jail well the fact that he was murdered is the result of the choice of the person who murdered him but the fact that he was in jail to be murdered was the result of his own choice and I think a lot of bad things are kind of explained that way where there's a combination of there's a kind of there's a whole storm of bad choices blowing this way and that from all different directions and it results in all kinds of bad things the other category the one that this atheist didn't even mention but which I think presents a greater challenge to believers that is the category of bad things that happen seemingly apart from anyone's choice at all so diseases okay or well of course there and there are diseases that are the result of choices that we make but there are many many many tragic millions of tragic examples of people being killed by horrible diseases completely apart from any choice at all that they made it just happened to them they were just victims of it and that's all take the most tragic example of all of course would be a child who dies of cancer how could God create a world where a five-year-old obviously through no fault of his own dies of leukemia or where anyone dies of leukemia or a world where anyone could die of any kind of horrible agonizing disease at all now I'm going to try my best to answer both of these I should warn at the beginning that I am NOT a theologian and the answer that I give is just my own answer now it's an answer that I hope is grounded in Christian teaching and in Scripture but my point is if it's a bad answer or incomplete or poorly conveyed then blame me for it okay don't blame Christianity that's that would be my fault now to understand these things we have to go back to the Christian doctrine of the fall and it seems like there are a lot of atheists and secular people who just simply don't understand this doctrine and have made no attempt to understand it and that's a problem because if you're going to raise these kinds of objections against Christianity then you have to understand at least on some level this doctrine because it all goes back to this now it's our belief as Christians that God created originally human beings who were in complete harmony with him with each other with themselves with nature with the world they were living in paradise so when an atheist says well if God is loving why did he create a utopia why didn't he create a world filled with nothing but love and happiness and kindness and peace and prosperity well the answer is he did create that world that's exactly the kind of world he created and he also created many other forms of life on earth but the thing that separated and here's the rub okay the thing that separated human life from all other forms of life is that human life was made in the image of God that's what it says in Genesis and to be in His image meant that these humans were not merely slaves to instinct or to nature they were given a will of their own a free will the ability to choose between one thing or another and that still is the primary thing that separates us from the animals is that we can make judgments about what we ought to do and what we ought not do animals cannot make those kinds of judgments they can't conceive of them they operate according to instinct and if they make any kinds of choices at all I'm going to run this way or that way it is it these are morally neutral choices and even those choices in the end go back to instinct we however are above that and so we can assess this is right this is wrong I'm gonna do the right thing or I'm gonna do the wrong thing and that will that incredible power that God gave us is one of the primary things so that makes us creatures in His image now as long as these humans chose to obey God and to remain in communion with him they were happy and they were safe and they were in paradise God ruled over man and through man God ruled over nature so we say that man had dominion over nature dominion over the animals well of course God is really the one who had dominion over nature and the animals but he had dominion over nature over the animals through man he ruled through man and man was able to enjoy that he was able to enjoy that Dominion so long as he submitted to God's Authority now if you're an atheist you don't let me just step to the side of Herman if you're an atheist you don't believe that any of this happened I realized that I know but the question that I was asked and that atheists ask all the time is why would a good God allow bad things I'm trying to explain that I am NOT trying to explain why God exists that's a completely separate conversation I'm just trying to explain how Christians can believe in a good God who allows bad things and this is one of the problems that we run into when it comes to you know discussions between atheists and theists is that every conversation eventually goes back to a argument about whether or not God exists and of course inevitably it will come back to that but if you're trying to understand you know individual Christian doctrines and if you're trying to understand not just our belief in God generally but our but I but our you know but but the the the kind of our belief in the the goodness of God and in the nature the good loving nature of God if you're trying to understand that then you have to be able to put aside for a moment your objections about the existence of God completely and instead look at the individual doctrines okay so there was this harmony and then man chose to rebel against God so before we got there now we just got into the rebellion but before we got to that point everything makes sense in terms of well this is what a loving God would do right Garden of Eden paradise even from an atheist perspective even though you don't believe in God but I guess you probably would say well yeah if there was a God and he really was a good God that's the kind of world he would have made okay great that's the kind of world he did make according to Christians but there was that that thing remember that power that will that free will that choice that he gave us so man took that choice and he used it to rebel against God and for the purposes of this conversation it doesn't really matter what what what exactly that choice was the exact nature of that choice for this conversation doesn't matter the point is he was given at every moment a choice between serving himself and serving God and for a period of time he chose to serve God he was happy and then one day he chose himself and then catastrophe struck and a whole literal world of misery followed now the - that is well why would anyone choose that you're in paradise you're in utopia I mean it's unreasonable to claim that somebody could be in paradise and then choose to destroy all of that well it is in the end and unreasonable choice but it is but is it unreasonable to believe that that a that a person in paradise would make that choice no it's not unreasonable at all I mean look even at your own life you have made in your own life if you're going to be honest about it you have made smaller versions of that exact same choice I'm sure there have been points in your life when you know you have been in a situation where there is relative harmony and ease and happiness and then you do something that destroys it and later on you look back on it with a little bit of maturity and wisdom and hopefully with some self-awareness and you say why did I do that it's crazy why I you know I had this good thing why did I ruin it or take a more extreme example of a very common example of somebody who's in basically a happy marriage a peaceful marriage a marriage with harmony and unity and then one day they go out and have an affair and even the affair itself there's that fleeting physical pleasure that comes with the affair but it's also caked in on both sides and guilt and and secrecy and lies in misery and all of that for this fleeting pleasure and then in the end it ends up destroying this good wonderful thing that the adulterer had and that person is gonna look back on it later and they're gonna say why did I do that you know when they're divorced and they're living alone in their one-bedroom apartment and their spouse hates them and their kids hate them they're gonna look back on that wonderful thing they had living in that you know in that nice home with the white picket fence and the kids and the nice family and the vacations and now they're now they're just alone in misery and they're gonna say I did I do that I I had everything so the point is you know it's not that hard to understand how a man in paradise could choose to destroy it because people have continued making exactly that choice over and over and over again and you yourself have made it on some level at various points in your life so a man chose to rebel and there was this break there was this divorce you know I use the example of marriage for a reason because that's the example that scripture uses constantly in in describing man's relationship to God the image of marriage is used frequently and God through the prophets in the Old Testament is constantly accusing sinners of being adulterous not because they're literally committing adultery although sometimes they are but but what he's saying is that they are adulterers because they are betraying him they're betraying their relationship to him so this image of marriage is used and so it makes sense to say that at the fall there was this split this divorce and the unity the harmony was destroyed by the free choice of man man had separated himself from God and in the process he had lost in many respects his dominion over nature he became subject to nature he found himself at nature's mercy because he had stepped out of line he'd stepped out of the process remember there was this process there was God man nature God ruled nature through man man had dominion over nature while man extricated himself from that process and ended up literally in the wilderness and now at the mercy of nature and so in some sense he still has dominion over nature but also nature has been minion now over him and this is where things like disease and senility and human frailty and all of that come into the picture but then the next question is okay well so it makes sense that the first human beings were given this choice they made the bad choice they suffer the consequence well then why do we all have to suffer the consequences and there is an element of mystery there we can't get around it we can't escape it God could have corrected the problem right away he could have corrected it balanced the account changed everything during mankind's first generation but he chose not to why did he make that choice well I mean nobody can speak absolutely to the motivations of God I think that's a very dangerous thing to try to do I'm not even going to attempt it but I will say this we have to understand that a change occurred not just to the individual people involved at the time personally but a change occurred to the human species to the human race a change occurred to our very nature there was a change in the nature of man these being the first humans our first parents them stepping out then stepping away from that harmony with God well kind of logically by doing that they took all of us out of harmony again it's not that hard do when we look at on a personal level we look at examples that are all around us now maybe examples that are owned in our own lives think about a a father who chooses to be abusive you know a father who chooses to be an abusive tyrant well when the father decides to be like that a change occurs to the family itself to the nature of the femme and the consequences will be felt through the generations a new course is set or you know what but I think a better example is let's go back to the divorce yeah let's there was the divorce that um when when man at the fall betrayed God there was that divorce think about divorces in you know actual personal marriages and let's say it's a divorce where one person where a man decides to abandon his family um while in doing that he has broken the family apart without the direct consent of all the other members of the family and he has set the family on a new course a bad course and it is a and he is he has he has set off a series of consequences that will be felt all through down the line that will be felt by his children and his children's children and his children's children's children even fifteen generations later you can look at children that are that are being born 15 generations later and you could say correctly that they would not be quite like this if not for the choice that that man made 15 generations ago you know there is this where all we are all connected right we're especially in a family we're all we we are all connected and the choices that we make affect others and the choices that we make as parents have effect on our children and all down the line so it makes sense that this horrible choice that our first parents made would be felt all down the line so that's all kind of on the first aspect of the question that's my very brief and insufficient explanation about how disease entered the world and why we are suffering the consequences of the fall today but let's look at the second aspect of the question what about all the bad things that happen as a result of people victimizing each other now this I think is easier to understand especially in light of what we just talked about and it's pretty simple I think God gives us the power to choose just as he gave Adam and Eve the power to choose he also gives us the power to choose and though they chose wrongly and we inevitably suffer the consequences of that wrong choice still we have the power to choose rightly now you can't help it if you were born to a broken family divorced parents abusive father whatever but you can help carrying that on you can help it if you make the same choice your likelihood of making the same choice may be increased because your parents were terrible but you don't have to make the same choice you could make a different choice and if you end up in the same situation you know if your parents were abusive terrible and then you end up abusive and terrible I think your parents deserve a lot of the guilt and blame for that because they set you on that course but you also deserve 100% of the guilt and blame because in the end you still made a choice why are we given a choice why does God allow us to make bad choices because choice and the potential for a bad choice is necessary for love to exist love is a choice and if we really are going to love God and love each other we have to choose it if you don't choose love then love is meaningless if your wife doesn't choose to love you then her love for you means nothing if your life if your wife wants to leave you and leave the marriage and your only way to keep her with you is to lock her in the basement then the fact that she is still with you and in the marriage is meaningless she's only there because she has no other choice but to be there if we have no choice but to love God then we are just God's robots we are God's puppets we are not creatures made in His image we are just puppets on a string and in that case in a world without choice and without meaningful chosen love then we would have to look at all the misery and all the suffering and say that it's all part of some weird awful game or stage player that God is putting on but that's not the case God wants us to love he created a world with love he created it in love God is love himself and God wants us to share in that love he wants us to be virtuous to be holy to be good to have joy but none of that can happen without choice but choice the choice to do something presupposes the option of doing the opposite if you have the choice to do X and X is good then you must also have the choice to do Y even if Y is bad if you had no choice but to do X then you never had a choice and you didn't choose to do X and therefore X is meaningless the fact that you're doing X means nothing and if God gives us the choice to do bad or good but then every time we try to do bad he just reaches out his hand and blocks us from doing it every single time then then then again we never really had a choice so why does God allow you know a man to set a building on fire for the same reason he allows a man to rush into a burning building and rescue a child from it if a man can't choose acts of cowardice and evil and destruction that he cannot choose acts of courage and self-sacrifice and generosity if we if we if we do not want a world with the potential for evil then that means we don't want a world with the potential for good and that's not to say that good is dependent upon evil it's not to say that this isn't dualism we're talking about here I'm merely saying that the point of life is to choose God and choose good and and in such a point such a purpose can't be achieved in a world where the opposite choice is impossible love is a choice by its nature and so what you could really say is God could not have created a world where there is love but no free will because love is a certain thing love has a nature again God is love and loved by its nature is an act of will God's love is perfect because his will is perfect which isn't to say that he doesn't have a will but his will is perfect but this idea that well why didn't God choose a why didn't God make a world where there's love and happiness and harmony but there's no choice for anything else and we're all just automata to always do the good thing well because that's nonsensical that's kind of like the question of can God make a you know create a boulder that's so heavy he can't lift it that's just a nonsensical question it means nothing and to say well could there be a world with love but no choice and no will that's just nonsense that means nothing it's like saying can there be a world with up and no down it's just it doesn't it doesn't make any sense now there's one other thing to remember and this is really important of course as Christians you know it's like we can't leave this part out of it that the Christian belief my own belief and if you're trying to understand the Christian believes you have to also keep this in mind that God did not abandon us to this fate yeah he created a world he created a paradise man chose to abandon that chose to serve himself rather than God and that choice has been repeated billions of times down the generations by everybody and many horrible things happen as a result and continue to happen however God did not abandon us to that he did he's not just sitting back and saying oops he's not just sitting back and saying well you know sorry about all that guys you're out of luck and that's why God sent his son that's why God sent Christ God Himself came to earth incarnate mankind to kind of drag us out of the pit I talked about the example of the you know of the burning building and the man who rushes in well God Himself was the man who rushed into the building to save us and so even though we live in a world now where there is misery and misfortune and pain and suffering and agony and all of those things we are not abandoned to that world we are not doomed to live in it forever and this is not the whole picture the whole story this is not the whole point the full point the full purpose will be realized in the next life but it is it is inevitable in the meantime that choice is a is a part of the story and that we have to continue making the right choices we have to continue choosing God so hopefully that was a somewhat sufficient explanation although if you're trying to find I can't find it if you're really looking for had the book somewhere if you're really looking for a better explanation as to you know if you if you want a better answer to this question oh here it is pick up this book problem of pain by CS Louis it's it's you know it's really short and thin here and he addresses this same question and he doesn't much better than I do and you can read this whole book in like a couple hours and I recommend that you do that as well thanks for watching everybody god speed
