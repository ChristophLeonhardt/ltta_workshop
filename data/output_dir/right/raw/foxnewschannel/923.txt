1
00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:01,601
THAT CAME OUT OF THIS AND

2
00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:02,769
KEPT ME GOING THROUGH ALL OF

3
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:05,172
IT JUST REEMPHASIZED HOW

4
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:06,406
WONDERFUL MOST PEOPLE ARE.

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,011
â™ª

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:11,878
>> Tucker: GOOD EVENING AND

7
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,280
WELCOME TO "TUCKER CARLSON

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,647
TONIGHT."

9
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:14,481
A BIG NEWS DAY.

10
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:15,849
MAYBE A PIVOTAL ONE.

11
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,351
THE DOJ RELEASED ITS LONG

12
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,519
AWAITED INTERNAL REVIEW

13
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,654
WRITTEN BY THE DEPARTMENT'S

14
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:21,354
INSPECTOR GENERAL AND IT'S

15
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,022
PACKED WITH INFORMATION.

16
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,356
IN A FEW MINUTES DONALD

17
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,825
TRUMP JR. WILL JOIN TO US

18
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:25,659
RESPOND TO IT.

19
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:26,827
FIRST, WHAT IS IN THE REPORT

20
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,129
IN THE DOCUMENT IS MORE THAN

21
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,163
500 PAGES LONG AND PARTS OF

22
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,565
IT ARE COMPLEX.

23
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:32,966
AND, YET, WITHIN MINUTES OF

24
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,901
ITS RELEASE, THE HAIR SPRAY

25
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,169
GENIUSES OF CABLE NEWS HAD

26
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,604
IT NEATLY SUMMARIZED FOR THE

27
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,238
REST OF US.

28
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:39,739
IT WAS A TOUGH DAY FOR THE

29
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:40,574
FBI, THEY SAID.

30
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,776
HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

31
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:43,643
A MONTH'S LONG INVESTIGATION

32
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:44,678
FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT

33
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:45,846
POLITICAL BIAS PLAYED ANY

34
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,781
ROLE IN THIS HIGH PROFILE

35
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,115
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

36
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,484
THAT'S ALMOST VERBATIM WHAT

37
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:51,885
THEY SAID ON THE OTHER

38
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:52,252
CHANNELS.

39
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:52,652
WE WATCHED.

40
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,187
AND THEY REPEATED IT NEARLY

41
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,789
WORD FOR WORD AT THE TOP OF

42
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,491
EVERY HOUR ALL DAY LONG.

43
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:58,892
ALMOST LIKE A TALKING POINT.

44
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,894
WHICH, OF COURSE, IS WHAT IT

45
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,228
WAS.

46
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,230
KEEP THIS IN MIND, IF YOU

47
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,464
LOOING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

48
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,532
ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THIS

49
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:06,633
COUNTRY, ALWAYS ASSUME THE

50
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:07,801
OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY ARE

51
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,903
TELLING YOU ON THE BIG NEWS

52
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,270
STATIONS.

53
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:10,904
AND THAT'S CERTAINLY THE

54
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,471
CASE HERE.

55
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,305
THEY ARE LYING.

56
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,407
IN FACT, TODAY'S IG REPORT

57
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,409
IS A VIRTUAL CATALOG OF

58
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,844
POLITICAL BIAS AND ABUSE OF

59
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:18,144
POWER.

60
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:18,912
IT IS TRUE THAT

61
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:19,679
INVESTIGATORS FOUND NO

62
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,014
EVIDENCE AT ALL THAT JIM

63
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,616
COMEY WAS TRYING TO SABOTAGE

64
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,150
HILLARY CLINTON'S

65
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:24,951
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

66
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,086
NO SURPRISE THERE.

67
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,654
COMEY IS A PARTISAN DEMOCRAT

68
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,155
AS HE HAS EXPLAINED

69
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,657
REPEATEDLY ON HIS BOOK TOUR.

70
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:31,892
THE BIAS, AND THERE WAS A

71
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,493
LOT OF IT, WAS AGAINST

72
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,661
DONALD TRUMP AND HIS

73
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,428
CAMPAIGN.

74
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,197
AND THERE IS AN ENORMOUS

75
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,498
AMOUNT OF THAT ON DISPLAY IN

76
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:38,999
THIS REPORT.

77
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:42,235
TRUMP IS A LOATHESOME HUMAN

78
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,036
FBI LAWYER LISA PAGE WROTE

79
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,905
TO HER BOYFRIEND FBI

80
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:45,605
OFFICIAL PETER STRZOK.

81
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,574
HE IS AN IDIOT.

82
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,376
AWFUL, ENORMOUS DOUCHE, A

83
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,211
DISASTER, HE SIMPLY CANNOT

84
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:51,945
BE PRESIDENT.

85
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,380
IS HE NOT EVER GOING TO

86
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,381
BECOME PRESIDENT.

87
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,715
RIGHT?

88
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,685
SHE WROTE TO STRZOK AT ONE

89
00:01:58,685 --> 00:01:58,985
POINT?

90
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,621
NO STRZOK REPLIED, NO; NO HE

91
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:01,922
WON'T.

92
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:02,522
WE WILL STOP IT.

93
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,490
KEEP IN MIND THESE ARE THE

94
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,291
PEOPLE RUNNING THE

95
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:04,958
INVESTIGATIONS INTO DONALD

00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,659
TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON IN

97
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,894
THE MIDDLE OF A PRESIDENTIAL

98
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:08,193
RACE.

99
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:09,596
IT'S ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE.

100
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,331
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S EVEN

101
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,032
MORE UNBELIEVABLE?

102
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,833
PETER STRZOK STILL WORKS AT

103
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:14,301
THE FBI.

104
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,236
THE MAN WHO PROMISED TO STOP

105
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,070
A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

106
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,672
FROM GETTING ELECTED IS

107
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,107
STILL COLLECTING A SALARY AT

108
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:21,775
OUR MOST POWERFUL LAW

109
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:22,442
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.

110
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,410
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR

111
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,978
EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL BIAS,

112
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,112
THERE YOU HAVE IT.

113
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,647
AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT,

114
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,949
IMAGINE THIS HEADLINE, FOR

115
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,350
EXAMPLE, SAY 10 YEARS AGO,

116
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,851
BARACK OBAMA SIMPLY CANNOT

117
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,286
BECOME PRESIDENT, WE WILL

118
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,589
STOP HIM, WROTE FBI AGENT

119
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:36,957
PETER STRZOK WHO STILL WORKS

120
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,091
AT THE BUREAU.

121
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,025
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

122
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,595
NO, YOU WOULD BE FIRED

123
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:42,862
IMMEDIATELY, FIRST AMENDMENT

124
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:43,229
BE DAMNED.

125
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,397
AND BY THE WAY STRZOK AND

126
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:45,599
PAGE WERE NOT ALONE.

127
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,800
THEY ARE NOT EVEN THE

128
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,601
STANDOUT CASES IN THIS

129
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:47,968
REPORT.

130
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,169
THE DOCUMENT QUOTES ANOTHER

131
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,971
FBI ATTORNEY, WONDERING,

132
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,505
QUOTE:  WHAT I COULD HAVE

133
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,306
DONE DIFFERENTLY TO STOP

134
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,008
DONALD TRUMP'S ELECTION AS

135
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:55,875
PRESIDENT.

136
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,210
THAT SAME OFFICIAL LATER

137
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,745
DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS PART OF

138
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,313
THE ANTI-TRUMP RESISTANCE.

139
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,615
FOR SOME REASON THE DOJ IS

140
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:02,716
HIDING THAT LAWYER'S NAME

141
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:03,350
FROM THE PUBLIC.

142
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,951
WEAVE DO KNOW HE SERVED ON

143
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:05,785
THE MUELLER TEAM UNTIL

144
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:06,586
FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR.

145
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:07,654
OF COURSE HE DID.

146
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,855
AND THERE'S A LOT MORE IN

147
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,689
THE REPORT.

148
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,291
HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF IT.

149
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,326
IT TURNS OUT JIM COMEY USED

150
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,362
A PERSONAL EMAIL ACCOUNT TO

151
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,096
CONDUCT GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,

152
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,097
JUST LIKE THE WOMAN HE WAS

153
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,665
IN THE PROCESS OF

154
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,399
INVESTIGATING FOR DOING THE

155
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,900
SAME THING.

156
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,235
IRONY ALERT.

157
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,470
HILLARY'S SECRET SERVER, BY

158
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,006
THE WAY IT DID INDEED HAVE

159
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:26,673
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ON

160
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:26,940
IT.

161
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,274
SOME OF THAT INFORMATION WAS

162
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,309
OBTAINED BY A FOREIGN

163
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:29,876
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.

164
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,710
AT LEAST ONE.

165
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,745
REMEMBER WE SUGGESTED THAT

166
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,514
VERY THING AND THEY SCOFFED

167
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:34,914
DERISIVELY?

168
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,082
IT TURNS OUT IT'S TRUE, LIKE

169
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:36,750
SO MUCH.

170
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,284
THE REPORT GOES ON TO REVEAL

171
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,853
THAT FBI AGENTS ROUTINELY

172
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,287

178
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,792
PEOPLE GONE TO JAIL FOR

179
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,293
THINGS LIKE THAT IN

180
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:47,694
WASHINGTON.

181
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,595
OF COURSE NOBODY NOE ONE AT

182
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,263
FBI WAS SERIOUSLY PENALIZED

183
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:50,597
FOR IT.

184
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,331
IT GOES ON LIKE THIS.

185
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,565
THE FBI IS OUT OF CONTROL.

186
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,200
THE CURRENT DIRECTOR CHRIS

187
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,468

PROFESSIONAL ANTIBIAS

194
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:03,610
TRAINING.

195
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,779
NOW, THAT MIGHT NOT MAKE THE

196
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:06,946
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS LESS

197
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:07,881
CORRUPT, BUT IT WILL

198
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:08,848
DEFINITELY BRING A

199
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:09,749
HEIGHTENED SENSE OF

200
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,418
SENSITIVITY TO QUESTIONS OF

201
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,787
TRANSGENDER BATHROOMS AND

202
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:14,387
TOXIC MASCULINITY.

203
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,255
THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU FEEL

204
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:16,589
BETTER.

205
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,058
FOX CHIEF INTELLIGENCE

206
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:18,658
CORRESPONDENT CATHERINE

207
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,325
HERRIDGE HAS BEEN ON THIS

208
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,260
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND

209
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,361
JOINS US NOW WITH A REPORT.

210
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,864
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE

211
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,166
SUM OF THE IMPRESSION THAT

212
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,333
YOU GET OF DIRECTOR COMEY

213
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,536
FROM THIS REPORT, CATHERINE?

214
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:30,970
>> WELL, THIS IS THE REPORT

215
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,238
RIGHT HERE, TUCKER.

216
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,074
AND IT'S AS YOU MENTIONED

217
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,008
OVER 500 PAGES LONG.

218
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,943
AND THE BOTTOM LINE WITH

219
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,912
DIRECTOR COMEY IS THAT THE

220
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,714
INSPECTOR GENERAL FOUND THAT

221
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,882
HE WAS INSUBBOARD NANT WHEN

222
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,018
HE MADE THAT JULY 2016

223
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,886
PUBLIC STATEMENT ABOUT THE

224
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,188
CLINTON EMAIL CASE WHERE

225
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,123
DIRECTOR COMEY RECOMMENDED

226
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,357
AGAINST CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR

227
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,292
THE MISHANDLING OF

228
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,293
INFORMATION AND THE

229
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,495
INSPECTOR GENERAL SAID THAT

230
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,996
COMEY DELIBERATELY HID WHAT

231
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,565
HE WAS GOING TO SAY FROM HIS

232
00:04:58,565 --> 00:04:59,432
BOSS, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

233
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,601
LORETTA LYNCH, AND HER

234
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,135
DEPUTY SALLY YATES.

235
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,369
AND THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY

236
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,105
TO DESCRIBE IT BUT IT

237
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,673
AMOUNTED TO INSUBORDINATION.

238
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,441
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT

239
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,909
BECAUSE, FOR COMEY, RATHER,

240
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,678
IT'S PART OF HIS LEGACY,

241
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:11,978
RIGHT?

242
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,346
HE HAS DONE A BOOK ABOUT

243
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:13,680
LOYALTY.

244
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,081
HE IS TOURING THE COUNTRY

245
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,583
TALKING ABOUT LEADERSHIP.

246
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,918
AND THIS REALLY IS SORT OF A

247
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,020
FOOTNOTE OR A BOOK END ON

248
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,390
HIS LEGACY, TUCKER.

249
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,958
>> Tucker: ONE OF THE

250
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:25,759
HEADLINES OF THIS REPORT

251
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,160
WHICH WE JUST QUOTED AT SOME

252
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,762
LENGTH WAS THE TEXT MESSAGE

253
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,196
FROM PETER STRZOK TO LISA

254
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:30,497
PAGE.

255
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,031
>> RIGHT.

256
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,732
>> Tucker: PROMISED WE WILL

257
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:33,166
STOP HIM.

258
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,034
>> RIGHT.

259
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:35,702
>> Tucker: MR. STRZOK STILL

260
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:36,236
WORKS AT THE FBI.

261
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,303
HAS THERE BEEN ANY

262
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,438
INDICATION OF WHETHER THERE

263
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,539
WILL BE CONSEQUENCES FOR

264
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:39,806
HIM?

265
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:40,306
>> RIGHT.

266
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,641
SO, WHAT WE LEARNED TODAY

267
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,910
FROM THE FBI DIRECTOR IS

268
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,278
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO REFER

269
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,881
SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES FOR

270
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:48,481
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION.

271
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,150
AND I JUST WANT TO KIND OF

272
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,818
DECODE THAT FOR YOU A BIT.

273
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,953
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION IS NOT

274
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:54,721
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.

275
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,890
AND FOR MANY OF THESE PEOPLE

276
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,691
WHO ARE, YOU KNOW, IMPLICATE

277
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,826
YOU HAD IN THE REPORT, THEY

278
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:00,994
HAVE ALREADY LEFT THE

279
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:01,327
BUREAU.

280
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,229
THEY HAVE RETIRED OUT.

281
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:03,730
>> Tucker: RIGHT.

282
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,764
>> THEY HAVE JUST LEFT ON

283
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,232
THEIR OWN OR THEY HAVE BEEN,

284
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,867
YOU KNOW, REASSIGNED.

285
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,235
STRZOK IS STILL THERE.

286
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,904
AND BASED ON WHAT WE READ IN

287
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,672
THE REPORT TODAY, THERE

288
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,340
SEEMS TO BE EVIDENCE, AS YOU

289
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,408
MENTION YOU, OF THIS

290
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:15,975
POLITICAL BIAS.

291
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,944
AND IF I COULD JUST SAY ONE

292
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,145
THING, I THINK IT'S SO

293
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:19,879
IMPORTANT TO PAY ATTENTION

294
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,880
TO THE LANGUAGE IN THE

295
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,681
REPORT.

296
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,750
WHAT THEY SAY IS THAT THEY

297
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,052
DIDN'T FIND TESTIMONIAL OR

298
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:26,619
DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE.

299
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:30,356
SO NO PAPERWORK AND NO

300
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,457
WITNESS TESTIMONY THAT

301
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,092
POLITICAL BIAS INFECTED THE

302
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,695
DECISIONS OF THE CLINTON

303
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:36,396
EMAIL CAMPAIGN

304
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,130
INVESTIGATION, PARDON ME.

305
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,064
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT DIDN'T

306
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,100
HAPPEN OR IT WASN'T THERE.

307
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,601
>> Tucker: RIGHT.

308
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,368
>> THEY ARE SAYING THEY

309
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,436
DIDN'T FIND EVIDENCE OF IT,

310
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:43,736
RIGHT?

311
00:06:43,736 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT
