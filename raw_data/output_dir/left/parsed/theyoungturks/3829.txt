AS OF NOW, THERE ARE STILL
MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS IN
REGARD TO THE TERROR ATTACK IN
LONDON, THIS IS REGARDING THE
TERROR ATTACK THAT HAS INJURED
22 INDIVIDUALS, LUCKILY THERE
HAVE BEEN NO FATALITIES.
EVEN
THOUGH NOTHING IS CONFIRMED IN
TERMS OF WHO DECIDED TO DETONATE
THIS HOMEMADE BOMB INSIDE A
LONDON TRAIN, DONALD TRUMP HAS
ALREADY TWEETED ABOUT THIS.
HE
TWEETED IMMEDIATELY AND HAS
ALREADY SPECULATED IN TERMS OF
WHO CARRIED OUT THIS ATTACK.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLES, HE
TWEETED --
LET'S JUST PAUSE THERE AND
BREAK DOWN EACH TWEET.
AS I SAID
IN THE EARLIER STORY, I KNOW IT
SOUNDS GOOFY CALLING THE LOSER
TERRORISTS, I THINK IT'S FINE.
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE WINNERS,
THEY WANT TO GET GLORY AND
HONOR, AND IF YOU RIDICULE THEM
AND CALL THEM WHAT THEY ARE,
WHICH IS LOSERS, THEY COULDN'T
ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING IN THEIR
LIVES SO THEY HAD TO GO TO
VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION TO DO
IT, IT MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE
CHILDISH TO SOME OF US BUT I
DON'T THINK SO, I THINK IT'S A
FINE THING TO SAY.
NOW, AS I
READ THE REST OF THE TWEET, I
WAS LIKE, WAIT, YOU ARE SAYING
SCOTLAND YARD IS ON IT, THERE'S
NO WAY SCOTLAND YARD ALREADY
WANTED TO ANNOUNCE SOMETHING,
UNLESS THEY ALREADY CAUGHT THE
GUYS, BUT I ALREADY READ THEY
DIDN'T CATCH THE GUYS.
SO
GODDAMN IT, DID YOU ACCIDENTALLY
GIVE OUT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
AGAIN, YOU KNUCKLEHEAD?
AND THEN
I GO TO SCOTLAND YARD'S
STATEMENTS ON IT, AND THEY GO WE
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHO WE
MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE TRACKING.
IN OTHER WORDS, THE IDIOT U.S.
PRESIDENT ONCE AGAIN GAVE
INFORMATION HE SHOULDN'T HAVE
GIVEN.
AND THE LAST SENTENCE
THERE IS, WHAT WAS IT, ANA?
MUST
BE PROACTIVE.
I MEAN, IF YOU
MEAN THAT SCOTLAND YARD AND OUR
AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE PROACTIVE
IN TRACKING TERRORISTS, OF
COURSE THEY SHOULD!
IF YOU MEAN
PROACTIVE IN, WHAT, LATER HE'S
GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE TRAVEL
BAN -- PROACTIVELY TARGETING ALL
INNOCENT PEOPLE IN A CERTAIN
CATEGORY?
THEN NO, YOU WOULD BE
WASTING SCOTLAND YARD'S
RESOURCES WHEN THEY SHOULD BE
TRACKING LEADS SO THEY CAN STOP
BOMBINGS LIKE THIS.
THEN AGAIN
UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE BACK TO YOU
BEING AN IDIOT.
HE CONTINUES ON WITH --
OKAY, WAIT, WAIT, THIS IS WAY
WORSE.
YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH
TERRORISTS IN A TOUGHER MANNER?
FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE THE DEATH
PENALTY IN AMERICA, SO WE CAN
EXECUTE THEM -- TOUGHER HOW?
THAT'S IN THE U.K., THEY DON'T
HAVE THE DEATH PENALTY BUT THEIR
MAXIMUM PENALTY IS LIFE IN
PRISON, SO THEY ARE PRESUMABLY
WORKING HARD AS THEY CAN.
HE
DOESN'T MEAN THAT, HE MEANS
DON'T TARGET THAT TERRORIST WHO
DID THAT, TARGET OTHER PEOPLE
WHO DIDN'T DO IT.
LIKE MY STUPID
MUSLIM BAN.
OR TOUGHER AS IN GO
BOMB RANDOM PLACES IN THE MIDDLE
EAST.
WHY DON'T YOU GO AND SEEK
JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO
ACTUALLY DID THIS?
BUT THE
SECOND PART IS MUCH WORSE.
THE
INTERNET IS WHAT THEY USE, SO WE
HAVE TO STOP IT?
OH NO, NO, WHAT
ARE YOU GOING TO DO -- NOW HE'S
GOING TO COME UP WITH
REGULATIONS ON -- FIRST OF ALL I
THOUGHT YOU WERE AGAINST
REGULATIONS -- REGULATIONS TO
STOP FREE SPEECH ON THE
INTERNET?
OR BETTER USE THE
INTERNET?
WHAT THE HELL DOES
THAT MEAN?
OBVIOUSLY THAT KIND OF
STATEMENT ISN'T READILY
DANGEROUS FOR ANYONE WHO
BELIEVES IN A FREE AND OPEN
INTERNET, AND I WOULD BE MORE
CONCERNED IF I THOUGHT OF TRUMP
AS SOMEONE WHO THINKS ANYTHING
THROUGH.
HE DOESN'T THINK
ANYTHING THROUGH.
HE DOESN'T
EVEN HAVE A REAL POLITICAL
IDEOLOGY, WHICH IS THE REASON
HE'S JUMPING FROM ONE POLITICAL
PARTY TO THE OTHER AT THE
MOMENT, WHICH IS FRUSTRATING A
LOT OF REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS.
BUT HE JUST SAYS THINGS WITHOUT
THINKING ABOUT THE
RAMIFICATIONS.
OBVIOUSLY THAT
CAN BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS,
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE'S UNWITTINGLY
LEAKING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
PERTAINING TO AN INVESTIGATION
ON A TERRORIST ATTACK, BUT IN
THIS CASE, OKAY, HE'S SAYING
THIS, BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE A
PLAN, HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL
THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND IT, HE'S
JUST -- HE'S JUST NOT FIT TO BE
PRESIDENT.
HE DOESN'T THINK
ABOUT ANYTHING HE DOES BEFORE HE
DOESN'T, HE DOESN'T THINK ABOUT
ANYTHING HE SAYS BEFORE HE SAYS
IT.
AND I'M SORRY, ANA, YOU ARE
1000% RIGHT -- IF YOU ARE A
RIGHT-WINGER WATCHING THIS
ONLINE, YOU REALLY WANT HIM TO
COME AS HE SAID, QUOTE, CUT OFF
THE INTERNET?
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
MEANS?
NOBODY DOES.
TRUMP
DOESN'T. AND IF HE ACTUALLY
MEANS IT, LET'S ASSUME HE'S
STUPID OR A LIAR LIKE YOU
PROBABLY ASSUME THE SAME -- BUT
IF HE MEANT IT AND YOU BELIEVE
IN YOUR BELOVED TRUMP AND HE'S
GOING TO CUT OFF THE INTERNET,
DO YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?
YOU LIVE ON THE INTERNET, RIGHT?
THAT'S SO PREPOSTEROUS AND
STUPID, AND IT GOES ALONG THE
SAME LINES AS THE MUSLIM BAN.
LET'S NOT GET THE GUY WHO
ACTUALLY DID IT, LET'S JUST GOT
OFF THE INTERNET FOR EVERYBODY.
JESUS CHRIST.
LET'S NOT GET THE
GUY WHO DID IT, INSTEAD LET'S
BAN RANDOM PEOPLE FROM YEMEN OR
SUDAN.
RIGHT, AND ALSO THE INTERNET
CAN BE A GREAT TOOL FOR
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE
HYPER FOCUSED ON MONITORING
EXTREMISTS RATHER THAN
INDISCRIMINATELY COLLECTING
METADATA ON EVERYONE.
ONE MORE THING ABOUT THAT.
IF
I'M THE PRESIDENT, WHETHER IT
WAS OBAMA OR TRUMP, I'M FURIOUS
AT OUR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.
AL
QAEDA HAS A MAGAZINE.
JESUS
CHRIST, IT'S CALLED INSPIRE
MAGAZINE -- VERY INSPIRATIONAL
-- AND THEY RECENTLY PUT OUT A
THING SAYING TO BOMBINGS ON
TRAINS, AND HERE WE HAVE A
BOMBING ON A TRAIN.
YOU CAN'T
TRACK THEIR MAGAZINE ONLINE?
YOU
CAN'T TRACK THEIR TWEETS AND
FIGURE OUT WHO IS SAYING IT, AND
THEN TARGET THEM AND GET THEM?
AND WE HAVE THEIR LEADERS
RUNNING AROUND, DECADE AFTER
DECADE -- WHAT THE HELL DO WE
HAVE INTELLIGENCE FOR?
TO
RANDOMLY SPY ON US?
TO DO
WARRANTLESS SEARCHES ON
AMERICANS AND NOT ACTUALLY CATCH
THE BAD GUYS?
I WOULD GO OUT
THERE WASTING THE TIME OF
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ON BLANKET
GO SCOUR THE ENTIRE INTERNET OR
1.6 BILLION MUSLIMS, I WOULD BE
LIKE GET ME THE SONS OF BITCHES
FOR PUTTING THIS MESSAGE OUT.
AL
QAEDA HAS BETTER TECH THAN WE
DO?
I WOULD FIRE EVERYONE IN THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND HIRE
THE BEST TECH GUYS IN THE WORLD,
DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO FIND OUT
WHERE THESE GUYS ARE WHO ARE
BOMBING US.
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD
USE OF INTELLIGENCE SERVICES,
AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVEN'T
DEMANDED THAT OF THEM IS
DISGRACEFUL.
THE TWEETS GET WORSE, BECAUSE
HE HASN'T YET SPECULATED IN
TERMS OF WHO THE TERRORISTS ARE,
BUT HE'S ABOUT TO DO SO --
I WANT TO STOP FOR A SECOND
WITH THIS TWEET ESPECIALLY,
BECAUSE ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I GET
IT, I THINK IT'S FAIR TO
SPECULATE THAT THE PERSON WHO
CARRIED OUT -- FOR THE PEOPLE
WHO CARRIED OUT -- THIS ATTACK
ARE MUSLIM EXTREMISTS.
HOWEVER,
AS THE PRESIDENT, YOU SHOULDN'T
SPECULATE.
YOU SHOULD WAIT UNTIL
YOU GET THE FACTS AND THEN MAKE
YOUR STATEMENT.
AND LOOK, IF YOU
DISAGREE WITH THAT POINT I JUST
MADE, KEEP IN MIND, DONALD
TRUMP'S REACTION, OR
NON-REACTION, TO HEATHER HEYER
GETTING MURDERED AT THAT HATE
RALLY IN CHARLOTTESVILLE,
VIRGINIA, AND THEN WHEN HE GOT
CRITICIZED FOR DELAYING A
REACTION, AND THEN REFUSING
TO CONDEMN THE WHITE
SUPREMACISTS, HERE IS
WHAT HIS EXCUSE WAS.
TAKE A LOOK.
HERE IS THE THING, WHEN I MAKE
A STATEMENT I LIKE TO BE
CORRECT.
I WANT THE FACTS.
THIS
EVENT JUST HAPPENED, IN FACT A
LOT OF THE EVENT DIDN'T EVEN
HAPPEN YET AS WE WERE SPEAKING,
THIS EVENT JUST HAPPENED.
BEFORE
I MAKE A STATEMENT I NEED THE
FACTS, SO I DON'T WANT TO RUSH
INTO A STATEMENT, SO MAKING THE
STATEMENT WHEN I MADE IT WAS
EXCELLENT.
SO WHERE ARE THE FACTS?
BECAUSE AGAIN, FOR A REGULAR,
AVERAGE JOE TO SPECULATE AMONG
FRIENDS, THAT IS ONE THING,
THAT'S FINE, AND I GET THE URGE
TO SPECULATE.
WHAT YOU ARE THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
YOU CAN'T HAVE A DOUBLE STANDARD
WHEN IT COMES TO AN AMERICAN
GETTING MURDERED BY A WHITE
SUPREMACIST IN OUR OWN COUNTRY.
IT'S A GREAT POINT BY ANA.
LET'S QUICKLY REVIEW, AND I
AGREE WITH YOU, WE ARE TALKSHOW
HOSTS, WE ARE ALLOWED TO
SPECULATE, WE THINK IT'S LIKELY
MUSLIM EXTREMISTS BECAUSE AL
QAEDA ASKED PEOPLE TO DO THAT
SPECIFIC ATTACK, IT HAS HAPPENED
BEFORE, BUT WE ARE OBVIOUSLY
OPEN-MINDED THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE
BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER KINDS OF
TERRORISTS IN THE WORLD, THERE
ARE SOME RIGHT-WING TERRORISTS,
LEFT-WING TERRORISTS USUALLY GO
AFTER, LIKE, ANIMAL FARMS OR
WHATEVER THEY DO -- ANYWAY,
OPEN-MINDED.
FINE.
BUT YOU ARE
THE PRESIDENT, YOU JUST TOLD US
THAT THE STANDARD IS, IF THERE
ARE TERRORISTS, AND
CHARLOTTESVILLE WAS AN ACT OF
DOMESTIC TERRORISM ACCORDING TO
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, ETC.,
THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT A COUPLE
OF DAYS AND GET ALL OF YOUR
FACTS.
BUT IN THIS CASE IT WAS
JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS, AND
SCOTLAND YARD SAID PLEASE DON'T
PUT OUT A STATEMENT.
THERESA MAY
HAD TO SAY NO ONE SHOULD PUT OUT
A STATEMENT IF THEY DON'T HAVE
ALL THE FACTS, MEETING, LIKE,
DONALD TRUMP, SHUT UP.
INSTEAD
HE THINKS IT'S MUSLIMS SO HE
JUMPS RIGHT IN IT. AND DONALD
TRUMP, ARE YOU GOING TO SAY
THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH
SIDES?
ARE YOU GOING TO SAY THAT
ABOUT THIS?
WHEN IT WAS DOMESTIC
TERRORISM, OUR COUNTRY, YOU ARE
OUR PRESIDENT, WHEN SOMEONE GOT
MURDERED, GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH
SIDES.
HE IS SO DESPICABLE.
THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY,
YOU ARE COVERING IT VERY GOOD, I
JUST WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW, HOW DO
WE HANDLE THIS NOW?
I LIKE WHAT
YOU SAID.
WE ARE THE ONLY ONES
UNDER SURVEILLANCE?
WHY DO WE
HAVE ALL THIS SURVEILLANCE IF WE
CAN'T FIND THESE GUYS, THEY HAVE
A MAGAZINE, THAT'S A GREAT
POINT.
THE UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT JUST DECIDED TO SPEND
$100 BILLION MORE ON DEFENSE
THAN THEY SPENT LAST YEAR.
$100
BILLION MORE.
ARE WE GOING TO
USE THAT MONEY EXACTLY THE SAME
WAY?
YES.
WHAT WOULD BE BETTER
TO STOP TERRORISM?
WHAT ARE THE
ROOT CAUSES OF TERRORISM?
NOBODY
EVER TALKS ABOUT THE ROOT CAUSES
OF TERRORISM THE WAY THEY
SHOULD.
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE 7
MILLION PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL IS COMING
FROM IN YEMEN, AND THERE WERE
13,000 CIVILIANS KILLED AND ONE
YEAR, FROM MARCH 2015 TO MARCH
2016, THAT THE ALLIED BOMBING
CAMPAIGN, KILLED 13,000
CIVILIANS.
WHY ARE WE FIGHTING SAUDI
ARABIA'S WAR IN YEMEN?
THE PETRODOLLAR, THAT'S WHY WE
ARE THERE.
EXACTLY.
SO WHEN YEMEN IS
FACING FAMINE, INNOCENT FAMILY
MEMBERS, CHILDREN, GETTING
MURDERED ON OUR WATCH BECAUSE OF
OUR ACTIONS, YOU THINK THAT
LEADS TO LOVE TOWARD THE UNITED
STATES OR THE WESTERN WORLD?
PEOPLE WILL TAKE THAT AND SAY
YOU ARE MAKING EXCUSES FOR
THE TERRORISTS.
NO, WE ARE TRYING --
THOSE TERRORISTS WHO CARRY OUT
THOSE ACTIONS NEED TO BE BROUGHT
TO JUSTICE, RIGHT?
BUT YOU ALSO
HAVE TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND
THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT OUR
FOREIGN POLICY HAS BEEN WORKING,
AND IT IS NOT WORKING.
IT IS
DRAINING OUR RESOURCES, KILLING
OUR SOLDIERS AND MEMBERS OF OUR
MILITARY, IT IS KILLING
COUNTLESS CIVILIANS ABROAD.
BANKRUPTING OUR TREASURY.
MY
POINT IS, WHAT IF WE TOOK THAT
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE
DON'T NEED TO SPEND, WHICH WE
ARE SPENDING BECAUSE IT'S A
GIVEAWAY TO THE MILITARY
INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX, AND TRY TO
HELP PEOPLE IN YEMEN INSTEAD OF
TRYING TO KILL THEM AT THE
BEHEST OF SAUDI ARABIA?
I THINK
THAT'S A BETTER ANTITERRORISM
TACTIC THAN TO KEEP TRYING TO
BLOW UP PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR AND
DESPERATE.
LET ME COMMENT FURTHER ON
THAT.
FIRST OF ALL THIS IS PART
OF THE PROBLEM OF CORRUPTION.
YOU SAY WAIT, WHAT DOES
CORRUPTION HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?
WE ALLOW LEGALIZED BRIBERY IN
AMERICA, SO WHAT DO DEFENSE
CONTRACTORS DO?
THEY WANT $100
BILLION EXTRA SO THEY GO AND
BRIBE ALMOST ALL OF OUR
POLITICIANS, AND BY THE WAY THEY
ALSO PUT ADS ON TELEVISION EVEN
THOUGH THEY DON'T SELL ANYTHING
TO CONSUMERS.
WHY DO THEY HAVE
ADS ON TV?
CAN YOU BUY A
MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR JET OR AN
AIRCRAFT CARRIER?
KNOW, BUT THEY
HAVE ADS ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY ARE
BUYING TV'S COMPLIANCE.
IT'S NOT
AN ACCIDENT THAT YOU HAVE VAPID
PEOPLE LIKE JOE SCARBOROUGH ON
TV, HE'S PAID TO BE STUPID.
HE
FAMOUSLY SAID WHEN THEY WERE
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY
SOMETIMES WE ARE ATTACKED BY
MUSLIM RADICALS, HE SAID THEY
HATE US BECAUSE THEY HATE US.
HE
REPEATED IS THREE TIMES, THAT
WAS HIS GENIUS CONCLUSION, HIS
INTELLECT, HIS SCHOLARLY WORK,
LED HIM TO CONCLUDE THEY HATE US
BECAUSE THEY HATE US.
WELL, WHO
WOULD PAY SOMEONE TO SAY SUCH A
STUPID THING TO A NATIONAL
AUDIENCE?
WELL, THE PEOPLE WHO
THINK, DON'T TELL THEM THE
TRUTH, DON'T ACTUALLY TRY TO
SOLVE THE PROBLEM, JUST PUT OUT
A BUNCH OF IDIOTS WHO WILL GO,
HEY, IF YOU ARE TRYING TO FIND
OUT THE ROOT CAUSE OF TERRORISM,
INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT'S GREAT,
SO WE CAN STOP TERRORISM -- NO,
WE ARE GOING TO YELL AT YOU AND
SAY ARE YOU TRYING TO BLAME BOTH
SIDES?
ARE YOU SAYING IT'S OUR
FAULT?
NO, WE ARE AMERICA AND
EVERYTHING WE DO IS WONDERFUL
AND PERFECT AND THEY HATE US
BECAUSE THEY HATE US.
I DON'T
WANT TO FIGURE IT OUT, I WOULD
LIKE TO BE PROACTIVELY STUPID
LIKE JOE SCARBOROUGH.
THAT IS
WHAT THEY GET PAID FOR, TO BE
STUPID.
LET'S NOT MAKE THAT
MISTAKE.
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
FOR A SECOND, WHY DO WE HAVE
RADICAL ISLAM RUNNING AROUND?
I
DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE WHOLE
DISSERTATION ON IT, GO BACK AND
WATCH THE VIDEO I DID EXPLAINING
HOW THE GODDAMN SAUDIS FUNDED
MEDIA AND CHANGE THE CULTURE ALL
AROUND THE MUSLIM WORLD AND WENT
TO RADICALISM AND VIOLENCE
BECAUSE OF THE WAHHABI STRAIN OF
ISLAM, THAT WASN'T DOMINANT
ISLAM UNTIL THE SAUDIS PAID FOR
MEDIA ACROSS THE WORLD.
AND THE
UNITED STATES HELP THEM.
WHY DID
WE DO IT?
NOT BECAUSE WE ARE
MALICIOUS AND BAD GUYS, ETC.,
THE BLACK-AND-WHITE WORLD
DOESN'T EXIST IN EITHER
DIRECTION -- NO, WE DID IT
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IF WE
RADICALIZE MUSLIMS, THEY WILL BE
MORE DEVOUT AND FIGHT THE
GODLESS COMMUNISTS.
BECAUSE WE
WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COLD
WAR. AND WE SAID OH MY GOD, THEY
ARE ATHEISTS, THAT DAMN SOVIET
UNION AND COMMUNISTS, GO GET
THEM, BECOME MORE RELIGIOUS.
AND
NOT JUST MORE RELIGIOUS TO HELP
THE POOR AND THE NEEDY, NO,
RELIGION MEANS YOU SHOULD PICK
UP A GUN AND FIRE AT THE
SOVIETS.
SO WE HELPED THE SAUDIS
SPREAD THAT POISON THROUGHOUT
THE WORLD, AND GUESS WHAT
HAPPENED?
IT BLEW UP IN OUR
FACE.
YES THE SOVIET UNION IS
GONE, NOW THEY ARE ATTACKING US.
AND INSTEAD OF FIGURING OUT HEY,
MAYBE THAT WAS A BAD IDEA, MAYBE
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE SPREAD THAT
IDEOLOGY AND ALSO GIVEN THEM
WEAPONS, WHICH THEN, A GUY NAMED
BIN LADEN WHO WE HELPED AND
FUNDED AND SUPPORTED IN
AFGHANISTAN, THAT'S A FACT, THEN
TURNED AROUND AND USED IT
AGAINST US.
MAYBE THE LESSON
FROM THAT IS, DON'T FUND THEM
AND GIVE THEM WEAPONS IN THE
FIRST PLACE.
MAYBE JIMMY IS
RIGHT, THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY
LEARN FROM HISTORY.
SO WHAT IS
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PLAN THE
UNITED STATES HAS EVER DONE IN
FOREIGN POLICY?
THE MARSHALL PLAN.
THE MARSHALL PLAN.
EVERYONE
KNOWS IT BUT NO ONE IN TV WILL
TALK ABOUT IT, NONE OF THE THINK
TANKS TALK ABOUT IT, NONE OF THE
POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT IT.
BUT
THAT'S PART OF WHAT MADE AMERICA
GREAT, THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE LOVED
US, BECAUSE WE TOOK TWO
COUNTRIES, THE BIGGEST WAR IN
HISTORY, ONE HAD NAZIS, THE
OTHER ONE ATTACKED US IN PEARL
HARBOR, OUR BIGGEST ENEMIES,
SOME OF THE WORST SCOUNDRELS,
MOST EVIL ENEMIES IN THE HISTORY
OF MANKIND, AND WE TURN THEM
INTO OUR TOP ALLIES.
JESUS
CHRIST, THAT IS AMAZING.
IT'S
THE MOST AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENT,
I WOULD ARGUE, PERHAPS IN HUMAN
HISTORY.
AND PEOPLE SAY I'M
GETTING TOO JINGOISTIC ABOUT
AMERICA, BUT I BELIEVE IN
AMERICA, I BELIEVE IN THAT IDEA,
I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THAT.
BUT IN
ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO
THINK, AND GET BEYOND THE
CORRUPTION, BECAUSE ALL OF THESE
SO-CALLED THINK TANKS AND
POLITICIANS AND THE MEDIA ARE
FUNDED BY THE SAME PEOPLE, AND
THEY ARE FUNDED TO CREATE MORE
WAR, MORE CONFLICT, NOT TO SOLVE
THE CONFLICT, AND NOT TO SOLVE
THE WARS.
SO WHEN WE GET BOMBED
BY TERRORISTS, UNFORTUNATELY
THAT'S NOT A MISTAKE, THAT'S NOT
AN OOPS, GOLLY GEE, HOW DID THAT
HAPPEN, IT PERPETUATES THE CYCLE
OF VIOLENCE WHICH MAKES SOME
PEOPLE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
IT
IS SICK, AND THAT'S HOW IT
HAPPENS, AND IF WE DON'T GET THE
CORRUPTION IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
FOR TIME IMMEMORIAL.
WE HAVE TO
GET TO THE ROOT CAUSE, WE HAVE
TO STOP LETTING MONEY FINANCE
OUR ELECTIONS, IF YOU LET
DEFENSE CONTRACTORS FINANCED
ELECTIONS OF COURSE YOU WILL
HAVE MORE WAR, AND BY THE WAY
MORE TERRORISM, BECAUSE IT HELPS
THEM BRING OUT MORE WAR.
