Dave 5:39 of the Trump administration a kind of split screen day of competing headlines as the president continued his overseas trip with that coming meeting with Vladimir Putin now just days away Peter struck the FBI agent who has come to personify Trump's fight and fury over this Russia investigation he was on the hill and sworn in for what became withering partisan questioning and there were fireworks more on that just ahead the president is spending the night in England before leaving the NATO summit in Brussels he was taking credit for the increases in allied military spending today I told people that I'd be very unhappy if they didn't up their commitments very substantially because the United States has been paying a tremendous amount of probably 90% of the cost of NATO and now people are going to start and countries are going to start upping their commitment so I let them know yesterday actually I was surprised I didn't pick it up it took till today but yesterday I let them know that I was extremely unhappy with what was happening and they have substantially up their commitment yeah and now we're very happy and have a very very powerful very very strong NATO much stronger than it was two days ago that's how that went but NBC News reports it was not clear that the President had actually obtained any new concessions from the allies present the leaders of France and Italy told the AP there was no agreement for additional spending president Trump had just arrived in the United Kingdom when there was new controversy it has to do with what he told a British newspaper about Prime Minister Theresa May and Britain's volatile debate over how to withdraw from the European Union brexit he tells the son that Prime Minister may ignored his advice on how to do it more on that ahead as well and there is new reporting tonight from the New York Times involving classified documents about an informant the FBI used in 2016 to look into any possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia Times says the White House has ordered that more lawmakers be allowed to see them but the biggest headline in the Russia investigation coming to from Capitol Hill specifically this controversy over the FBI informant and the agency's initial handling of the investigation FBI agent Peter struck who helped open that inquiry testified for over nine hours today into tonight in front of the combined House Judiciary and oversight committees about a series of anti-trump text messages to another FBI employee Lisa Paige sent during the 2016 campaign again and again struck was asked to respond to accusations from Republican House members who insisted those texts were clear evidence that his investigation was blatantly biased against the president let me be clear unequivocally and under oath not once in my 26 years of defending our nation did my personal opinions impact any official action I took this is true for the Clinton email investigation for the investigation into Russian interference and for every other investigation I've worked on I'm also proud of our work on the Russian interference investigation this investigation is not politically motivated after it is not a witch-hunt it is not a hoax some of the most contentious questioning came from South Carolina Republican congressman trey Gowdy one of the more vocal supporters are bringing the mulher investigation to a close you're eight days into your Russian collusion with the Trump campaign investigation and you got another text from your colleague Lisa Paige Trump's not ever going to become president right right and you replied no no he's not we'll stop it by the time you promise to stop him from becoming president on August the 8th how many interviews had you conducted mr. gowdy so to answers that one with regard to how many interviews had or had not been conducted I've been directed by counsel for the FBI not to answer that question I don't recall writing that text well I deny the text what I can tell you is that text in no way suggests that I are the FBI would take any action to influence the candidates that is a fantastic answer to a question nobody asked at another point California Republican congressman darrell Issa asked struck to read his own text messages out loud and I'm gonna just go to go to a date and then ask you to read your own words March 4 2016 you want me to read this yes please yes sir oMG he's an idiot July 21st 2016 Trump is a disaster I have no idea how destabilizing his presidency would be and during another controversial exchange which may have been the day's low point Texas Republican congressman Louie Gohmert referred to structs affair with lisa page the FBI agent with whom struck had exchanged the text message and I've talked to FBI agents around the country you've embarrassed them you've embarrassed yourself and I can't help but wonder when I see you looking there with a little smirk how many times did you two look so innocent into your wife's eyes and lied to her about the fact that you would question whether or not that was the sort of look I would engage with and a family member who I have acknowledged hurting goes more to a discussion about your character and what you stand for with that let's bring in our leadoff panel on a Thursday night Jeremy Bash is back with us former chief of staff at CIA and the Pentagon he happens to be former chief counsel to the House Intelligence Committee Joe wine bank's attorney and former assistant Watergate Special Counsel and Frank fickler Z former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence who has worked for robert muller among others we're happy to say that all three are MSNBC analysts Frank because of your history with the bureau and because this is at heart an FBI saga and FBI story on what like to begin with you what happened today did you take away any tangibles and who or what one if anything Brian there was only one clear winner today in a spectacle of a hearing and that really was Vladimir Putin he's sitting back pleased with his intelligence services it's sowing discord and disarray that's their objective and they couldn't in even in their wildest strategy sessions have dreamed that this would turn up to turn to turn up into an FBI counterintelligence official being berated and denigrated by the Congress this is the clear winner today what we saw today was partisan politics at its very worst what we saw was an FBI agent trying to defend his personal political opinions against a tirade of political partisans putting their own political and self-interest above those of the national interests Jeremy do you find any hyperbole in what Frank Fick luzie just said no I think investigations have to be beyond reproach integrity has to be the pillar of an investigation and that's why I think even though you could argue that some of the text messages were innocuous it was appropriate for Bob Muller to remove struck from the investigation more than a year ago and the bottom line is that this whole hearing was epic nonsense because the real issue is that the Muller investigation has resulted in five convictions in 20 indictments with individuals either in prison or facing prison who are in senior levels of the Trump campaign and the central issues here which is what return on investment has the Russian Federation gotten for not only meddling in the election which is the phrase everybody uses but actually favoring Donald Trump what return on investment have they gotten we're seeing it now play out across the continent of Europe this weekend so this hearing in many ways Brian was merely a distraction from the bigger national security issue facing our country which should be approached on a bipartisan nonpartisan basis so Jill wine banks as a veteran of the hill as a former Watergate prosecutor what stood out to you today I think what stood out to me the most was how much this sounded like the McCarthy hearings the interrogation of Peter struck was really unbelievable it was proof that this investigation of the Russian interference is not a hoax and not a witch-hunt but that this was both a combination of a circus a tragedy a comedy it is hard to take seriously how he was attacked today with no purpose hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on
