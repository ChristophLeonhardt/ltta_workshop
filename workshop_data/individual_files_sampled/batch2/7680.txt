you know the series true north where we sent gianna I roll it to the Arctic and I know what you're wondering why did you bring him back no we had to bring him back okay and I'm the same thing you're wondering is okay well they did 15 episodes and they were fantastic but Jen can you give us one more lucky news for you today this 63rd final episode drops today oh no here it comes alright enough dancing okay so they go deep into the Arctic in this case John boarded a ship it was a green pieces Arctic sunrise he took it over and crashed and now none of that happened but he did go on the ship and that and they look at the fight to protect the region from corporations and governments looking to exploit it you're gonna get a teaser in a second a trailer in a second but everybody go to go 90 dot-com to check out now finally the complete 16 part series and if you watch the earlier parts the final episodes here please check that out and if you live abroad no problem at all you can actually go to true north show dot tumblr.com and get all 16 episodes as well so the last episode dropping today here's a trailer for it and then go watch all of True North it's fantastic Greenpeace is facing off against the most imminent threat to the Arctic environment oil drilling the oil companies need to look for new frontiers and they would go for the cheapest and easiest first and when that run out they start to go into unconventional oil like tar sands and Arctic oil the Arctic is challenging for the oil companies let's also put the price of producing oil up they need to develop new technologies but they see it's worth it because they're running out of oil other places on the planet then the regional government identified what is called the vulnerable areas and there was a consensus that there will be no oil drilling along the ice age this ice age has moved further northwards and then the present government said ok then we can permit oil drilling further north because of climate change the is't is patrolling and then you can permit more oil drilling that leads to more climate change so I think it's a bit ironic we saw the beginnings of what could be seen as a Arctic oil rush the Norwegian government is looking north to expand the oil industry to handle down hundreds of new oil Asus's to all the big players the US companies VPS Telus Russian Swedish state'll than which in state-owned oil company is the first one to drill in the new licenses and is doing that this summer party is still Arctic even if the ice is melting it will be dark in the winter it will be storms and of course if there is always spirit how do you clean it up particularly if there is ice there what happens does it degrades now you know that from your experiences of Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska waters and recent attempts to drill in the Arctic have not gone well
