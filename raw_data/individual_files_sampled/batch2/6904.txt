so Washington Post did an amazing job of figuring out who Donald Trump was actually called and among the grieving family members about 20 of them so far unfortunately during Donald Trump's term and buy-in but again I'm not almost all these are just because we're in Afghanistan even the the Niger situation was an ambush I don't think there was anything they could have done about it so I'm not blaming Trump for having 20 people die on his watch that's I think you know unfortunately part of what comes along with the territory of us being in so many different countries I don't think we should be in those countries that's why part of why I want to come back because I don't want to lose any more of our fallen soldiers or have more soldiers pass away etc anyway but they reach 13 of the family members and about half of them said yes they did get a call from President Trump and the other half said no we'd never got a call no call no letter no nothing so the guy who went around criticizing Obama and and Bush for not calling the family members of course it turns out for about half the people that they reached he hadn't called him he's so his hypocrisy is of course boundless we know that but an interesting part of the story and by the way and some of these people are Donald Trump supporters and and here let me give you an example of Whitney hunter this just came out right before Showtime she says she has nothing bad to say about the president doesn't want to get into that and it's not political at all she just said she and she has great things to say about vice president pence who she met and gay he gave her condolences and he she felt really comforted by that her or her husband was Jonathan a hunter who was killed in Afghanistan but pence and and others said the Trump would call her later and he never did and she said I do know the difference between right and wrong and whenever you say you're gonna do something you're supposed to do it so it seems like it's a person who respects the office wanted to call from Trump you know no bias here no anything but but Trump still didn't call now if you don't call you don't criticize other presidents okay look you know I may be you know I don't know I don't know to what degree you absolute should call every one of those fallen soldiers but you can't do both but I'm about to get to something even worse did you want to say something Anna I did and I'm unsure of whether or not you're going to touch on another person that he called a father who lost his son and he made a promise yeah that's where I was going with okay yes so - of all the so all the non calls are terrible as when he's a hypocrite about it and then there are the cause so I told you earlier in the show about a call where guys a trump supporter though the son it was a trump supporter and but Trump went on a 10-minute tangent about how great his record in office has been and the guy's like oh okay but again he wasn't criticizing the president he was like I appreciated the call right but one was super interesting he called Chris Baldrige who was the father of Army corporal Dylan Baldrige from North Carolina he was 22 years old and him and two fellow soldiers were gunned down in Afghanistan by Afghan police officers okay and he calls the guy and and Chris Baldrige talks about here I'll give you the exact quotes he said President Trump offered him $25,000 and said he would direct his staff to establish an online fundraiser for the family but neither happened the father said and now let's go to Chris Paul juices quote he said I'm gonna write you a check out on my personal account for $25,000 and I was just floored I couldn't believe he was saying that it and I wish I had a recorder because the man did say this he said no other president has ever done something like this but he said I'm going to do it now the reason that this even came up is because Bal ridges ex-wife is actually going to get the hundred thousand dollars that that people get when when their family member dies in battle and Chris Baldrige was saying you know we're the ones having to deal with it so without getting into that family drama Trump seemed like he was doing a nice thing and said you know what I'll give you 25,000 out of my pocket he does that so people like him but he never follows through that we've done a thousand stories where he promises he's going to give money and doesn't because he's a pathological liar and so it's one thing when you do it as a PR gimmick and you're a marketing clown and you're civilian it's another thing when you're president and you're calling a fallen soldiers father and then you're like oh this will make me feel good I promise to give him $25,000 and then I'll sniff him again it doesn't matter I never deliver on my promises of course nobody's gonna find out how the hell are they gonna find out about this call because we didn't think that this would ever become an issue I mean he's such a bad guy because it's it's feeding his ego to say I'll give you the 25 thousand you didn't have to say that you have no obligation to give him 25 thousand dollars out of your pocket right but he couldn't help himself because all he's got to feel good about himself but he's not actually gonna give him the money because he's not even rich he's a scam artist and and finally Sarah okapi Sanders would asked about all these since you know about the hypocrisy that you criticized Obama for not calling soldiers he didn't in trumpeters I didn't call the family members and it turns out Obama did actually go to a gold star event and sat next to John Kelly at the gold star event right it's so Sanders says I think that general Kelly is disgusted by the way that this has been politicized Trump politicized that but specifically mentioned general killing no one mentioned general Kelly outside of Donald Trump he's the one that came out and said oh yeah that's general Kelly for Obama called him when his son died haha general Kelly yeah that's politics right there and then she turns around goes I can't believe you guys politicize this helped us fill the independent media together come join us TYT Network comm slash join
