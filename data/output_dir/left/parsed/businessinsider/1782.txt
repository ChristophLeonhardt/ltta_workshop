Hillary's got her share of critics she
has been caricatured by the right and
buy some on the left she has been
accused of everything you can imagine
and some things that you cannot but she
knows that's what happens when you're
under a microscope for 40 years she
knows that sometimes during those 40
years she's made mistakes just like I
have just like we all do that's what
happens when we try you've got to get in
the arena wither because democracy isn't
a spectator sport
America isn't about yes he will it's
about yes we can
and we're going to carry Hilary to
victory this fall because that's what
the moment demands
