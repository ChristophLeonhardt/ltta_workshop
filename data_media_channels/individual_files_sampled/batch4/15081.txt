well-well-well for all the Guardians shocked about the Cambridge analytical scandal it turns out they've been doing exactly the same thing in what seems like a desperate attempt to somehow stay relevant you've seen the Guardian scathing reports on Cambridge analytic awright I mean I'm no fan of what Google and Facebook have been up to in fact I've been taking extra precautions with these platforms for years and now I'm definitely gonna do more but data mining is a modern reality now and what Cambridge analytical is done with the u.s. election is nothing surprising or new when you agree to these ridiculously long terms and conditions you're signing away a lot you're signing away your personal data your online activity and a lot of interesting stuff that you do online if what you do is done within the realms of Facebook and Google you can be sure that that data is being stored somewhere it's just what happens now and what Cambridge analytic had did was use that data to run a political campaign if anything shocking here is the fact that Facebook and Google have been harvesting way more data than we thought do you know that Facebook's even been recording your phone calls and text messages yeah not cool that's a story for another time but I'm not shocked that a company whose goal it is is to help clients win elections use this data and so the reports from The Guardian with the shock and outrage just makes me bought give me a break a data firm use data to win an election no way and in a hilarious twist of fate it turns out that the Guardians basically been doing the same do you know that the Guardian has been nicking your data and flogging behavioral information to third parties well maybe not you you're probably too sane to read The Guardian if you're watching this but they've been mining the data of their blue-haired windbag readers at least we're talking potentially millions of profiles being harvested by the Guardian app and there's no surprise really the newspapers in trouble and it relies on advertising revenue to stay alive but unfortunately the digital readership just isn't big enough for the models who work the paper lost 75 million dollars in the year up to March 2016 and while all newspapers have struggled with traditional paper sales with most newspapers roughly having their circulation since 2010 the Guardians only shifting 150,000 copies as over last year that's almost on par with Scotland's daily record circulation of 138,000 and nothing close to the sun's 1.5 million so it seemed like they've been sneaky they've done what the awful Trump campaign did and used data to help communicate with their supporters but unlike the Trump campaign which quite publicly embraced Facebook as a source of campaigning the Guardians kept this little number quiet haven't they hidden away in their massive privacy policy forgotten about and never spoken about I bet they completely forgotten about this when their journalists suddenly started mouthing off about Cambridge analytic err it's quite funny interestingly the Guardian is reported that Cambridge analytic may have shockingly harvested the data of 50 million Facebook accounts but as Edith Fox rightly points out the Guardian may have harvested data from as many as 590 million profiles using the same maths use test to make Cambridge analytic as reach of 50 million accounts multiplying two hundred and seventy thousand accounts they have access to and the data harvested for on average from just under two hundred friends each it seems that the Guardian could have harvested data from as many as 590 million Facebook profiles naughty naughty naughty The Guardian claims that the app currently has 3.2 million active users if each one of those users has on average 185 friends that's over 590 million tut-tut-tut so if for some reason you have the Guardian app on your phone get rid of it and remove its access to your Facebook profile in your account settings pronto and by the way do you think that we're gonna see articles in The Guardian or any of the left-wing press about this huge breach of trust by the Guardian or do you think this is just going to be conveniently swept under the rug and forgotten about I think we know the answer to that one don't we I mean I'm sick of it all hypocrisy of these people I've been on the end of it for years these dirtbags lied and called me everything under the Sun from a Nazi to a white supremacist a racist a bigger shockingly offensive alot but you know what at least I'm not hypocrite at least I don't lie at least I don't call people out for things that I do myself I know st. but when I talk to the press I tell them the truth when the press talks to me they just forget everything that I tell them and conveniently misrepresent the truth they're scum they're the worst kind of scum and I guess they're never going to stop lying but listen there are some little things that we can do to hurt them obviously we shouldn't be buying their papers but make sure that they don't get anything valuable from you delete their app stop websites and if you do have to read their articles online use an ad blocker we owe these liars nothing watch me and the rest of the rebel team on our brand new app download it now from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store you
