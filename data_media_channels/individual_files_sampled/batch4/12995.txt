let's just drill down into what this is if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed which he almost certainly will be people are worried these hostile to roe v wade in the hill overturn roe v wade i'm not so sure about that a bent is not so sure about that ben thinks that he would not actually overturn roe v wade they might play some further restrictions on abortion but that there's enough precedent that Cavanaugh in his judicial opinion wouldn't overturn it who knows we'll have to see what happens with the left is saying is that if roe v wade gets overturned then we're going to have abortion outlawed across the country that's not true what happens if roe v wade is overturned is that the question is returned to the states and some states will have legal abortion some states will not have legal abortion that's our federal system that's a wonderful thing what they're the left is also saying is that the Constitution has a right to abortion enshrined in it and I have to ask them I've never gotten a good answer to this do they really believe that James Madison and Alexander Hamilton sat down said okay we're gonna have a free speech in there yeah we're gonna have a balance of power separation of powers and oh hey Alexander don't forget the right to an abortion you can't forget the right to an abortion in there that's that's what we fought that revolution for isn't it Alexander of course not nobody thinks that that is the case but the left is not playing politics in good faith here they're not playing but they're interrupting the hearings they're making a total show of the hearings they're pretending that all of you know millions and millions of documents need to be read from when Brett Kavanaugh was in middle school or else we can't decide if he's an able judge the man's been a judge for a long time people on both sides of the aisle say he's a very competent judge they're not playing politics in good faith they know that they lost they're still really sore bellows in that election and rather than regrouping or using legal or serious means of trying to counter the current president they're throwing these hysterics they're just throwing a total temper tantrum
