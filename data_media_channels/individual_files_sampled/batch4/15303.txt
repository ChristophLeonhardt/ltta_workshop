we are continuing our coverage from CPAC joining me now it's none other than a guy who seems to pretty much sleep here all year Curt reflected you're always here I could have gotten here three weeks ago you'd have been here I you know it's not quite true but while C packs going on look this is my Woodstock it is you said you get your Coachella it's Mike OHL it's like Burning Man for people with jobs and intelligence where we're gonna burn a giant liberal out front burn an effigy did you did you hear them shouting burn her to Dana last she left me you know I was which burning it we were talking about that was it was it was terrible there was the event CNN event in South Florida hard to believe that CNN turned into a bunch of garbage and you and I were talking to some people who were there at the event conservatives who literally and I don't think they were being dramatic I think they're being honest we're concerned for their own safety yes that's a problem yes and I and these folks can take care of themselves these are not ranking by Wallflower shrinking these are not George Will conservatives these are punching in the face conservator Fredo cons yeah and no Fredo cons did you see the afraid of guns I have not seen anything anybody pushing cruises or anything like that nobody pushing cruises no shuffleboard Oh but going back to the CNN event last night in Florida in South Florida it's troubling that CNN would invite prominent conservatives and then not provide them adequate security there's that to me he seems somewhat by design I think I think it's all part of the package I think that day that CNN wanted to whip up a lot of hatred and didn't care about the consequences yep I intend to agree I tend to agree and you know I entreated something out yesterday couldn't cert we never seem to say after any tragedy we never seem to see that children ugh conservatives we never seem to see the NRA handing kids talking punch we don't see people on the right politicizing the tragedy yeah that's that's entirely true the thing that I feel better about about all this is I think that we are woke woke we're gonna get there to the scam yeah I don't think it's working I don't think there's any change among normal Americans about their right to keep and bear arms because of all this stuff I think we see very clearly that's not a good faith argument it's emotional manipulation designed to bum-rush us into giving up our rights and it's not going to happen you know what's interesting but I had I had spoken a little bit earlier to a woman from independent women's forum headed their head of policy and I expected when I asked her about gun control and self-defense and Public Safety I expected their membership the groups they surveyed abilene left she said no there-there is concerned about it as everybody else and they're not willing to give up their right that really contradicts the narrative that CNN MSNBC The Washington Post the New York Times is telling us that all women want to grab every gun and they want those guns burned in a furnace I've got somebody from the in these were conservative women is the independent women for us independent non party affiliated Women Voters who are saying no you're not going to take my right to self-defense away see the the thing is the Washington Post in New York Times CNN it's really an echo chamber and they're really talking themselves and they're very impressed by what they're doing and I don't think it's resonate no one watches CNN no one who's not liberal or or who has two four doesn't have two for a job reads the Post or the New York Times well that's right and if you stock a pond with fish that have been hand fed don't be shocked when they rise to the surface and eat out of your head this isn't River this isn't complex media analysis here CNN stocks an arena full of people with ideologically like-minded ones yeah and got they both they got the reaction they desired I mean Marco Rubio is this milquetoast as it gets and they treated Marco Rubio as if he was Wayne LaPierre yep whoa let me the problem with Marco Rubio is he's a simpering would you know he's one of those idiots who doesn't understand I'm using the word idiot because he does stupid things he doesn't understand what's going on they do not have a conversation they are advocates so when you walk in and say let's have a conversation about guns and you walk in ready to have a conversation I'll give we'll take we'll discuss the fact and change our views and you're against someone who's an advocate you're going to lose Marco Rubio is a dumb man know exactly what is going in their starting point is in a conversation their starting point is we have a starting point and an ending point we want your gun yeah we have a goal we have a goal and Marco Rubio well I'd like to work together to find shut up I'm never I'm never won shut up they don't want to work together this is about power they want power over us they want our weapons they wants disarmed and they want us that to acquiesce to whatever they do that is their goal so here's they're not here to discuss they're here to argue that's why they're using emotional manipulation and abuse and threats you know you and I were I was talking about a conversation that we had heard earlier today and I'm starting with a man who had a little I love it and it was that conservatives don't turn out high quality entertainment project that's true why do you think that is um first of all there aren't a lot of conservatives in the industry I don't think that I don't think that being conservative somehow keeps you out of the industry it's just a very liberal industry and I know conservatives in and they do have to keep their head stand right I think when you get into those circles like publishing and stuff there's a tremendous amount of pressure to conform you want to be accepted into that world it's easy to do with your politics why why create another barrier they're a very high-paying job some of these people are making eight figure bonuses if things go well in the studio's you and I would never be senior executives at MGM it's just not that's not in that world you the ER thing is I mean those are technologies changing things look at this setup we have here that's very true it used to be to have to broadcast like this you needed a giant crew and a ton of stuff and you really don't now you know still can nr a new set up over there is very very elaborate a lot of people right but we're getting the same project with half the staff yeah yeah it's not the same it's not the same broadcast quality style it is but it's a good enough product it isn't good enough product and I think you know but it does also something to be said for flexible that's true there is flexible on the fly that's that's the think technology is allowing the flexibility for other people to get into the game you everybody has DIRECTV you know the problem you're at home Friday you don't want to go anywhere let's watch someone to write TV it's right and you have five million direct-to-video movies none of which you've ever heard of and you can't choose which one are you gonna Netflix or Amazon Prime or you got five million more options but who's making them people with one one one-hundredth the cost of what it used to do to do it on film you know what you do it on video name well that's why CNN The Washington Post in The New York Times oh yeah no longer have a monopoly Kurt Schlichter as always a pleasure thanks for having you got it my
