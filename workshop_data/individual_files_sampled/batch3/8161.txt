. MARK: HELLO, AMERICA. I'M MARK LEVIN. THIS IS "LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN." I HAVE A WONDERFUL GUEST TONIGHT. GARY SINISE, HOW ARE YOU, MY FRIEND? I'M GOOD, MARK, THANKS FOR HAVING ME. MARK: HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN FIVE, SIX YEARS. IT'S BEEN AWHILE. MARK: I WANTED TO BRING YOU OUT HERE, MEMORIAL DAY IS NOT THAT FAR FROM NOW, AND YOU DO THIS MAGNIFICENT PROGRAM EVERY YEAR EXCEPT FOR LAST YEAR WHEN YOUR DAUGHTER HAD A BABY. THAT IS THE NATIONAL MEMORIAL DAY CONCERT. I DON'T MISS IT. THERE ARE OTHER THINGS I WANT TO GET INTO, AND YOUR ACTING CAREER. TO ME, YOU ARE KIND OF UNUSUAL FOR HOLLYWOOD. YOU ARE AN EXCEPTIONAL PATRIOT. YOU ARE A SUPER PATRIOT. YOU ARE INVOLVED IN VETERANS' ACTIVITIES. YOU ARE INVOLVED IN SO MANY VETERANS ACTIVITIES, I CAN'T KEEP COUNT OF THEM. WEEKEND JUST SO YOU KNOW. OVER THE LAST WEEKEND. LET'S GET STARTED WITH. THIS FIRST OF ALL, A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND. YOU GREW UP IN CHICAGO? YEAH, I WAS BORN ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO IN A TOWN CALLED BLUE ISLAND, WHICH IS SOUTH SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO, AND THEN I MOVED EVENTUALLY, WHEN I WAS NINE, JUST AFTER THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION, I REMEMBER THAT, VERY, VERY WELL, I WAS IN ABOUT THIRD GRADE WHEN THAT HAPPENED. AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR 1964, WE MOVED UP TO HIGHLAND PARK WHICH IS A NORTHERN SUBURB OF CHICAGO. ABOUT 25 MILES NORTH OF CHICAGO. THAT'S WHERE I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL. THAT'S WHERE I STARTED ACTING IN HIGH SCHOOL PLAYS. MARK: BEFORE YOU STARTED ACTING, WHAT KIND OF A KID WERE YOU? WELL . MARK: LITTLE ROUGH? YEAH, I THINK I THINK SOME OF THE MOVES THAT WE MADE EARLY ON BECAUSE WE MOVED WE MOVED WHEN I WAS NINE OR TEN YEARS OLD AND MOVED AGAIN WHEN I WAS IN SEVENTH GRADE, AND MOVED AGAIN RIGHT AFTER FRESHMAN YEAR. THERE WERE CERTAIN MOVES I THINK. IT'S DISORIENTING FOR A KID TO GET EMBEDDED WITH A CERTAIN GROUP OF FRIENDS AND THEN GET DISPLACED AND HAVE TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS AND ALL OF THAT. SO I HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE. PLUS, I MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH SOME SORT OF LEARNING DISABILITY BACK THEN, IF THEY KIND OF WERE DOING THAT BECAUSE I HAD A HARD TIME READING, I HAD A HARD TIME WRITING, SO ACADEMICS WERE ALWAYS A STRUGGLE FOR ME. I WAS KIND OF A DAY DREAMER KID, YOU KNOW? THERE'S ALWAYS SOME, AND I WAS ALWAYS DOING THAT. I LOVED SPORTS. I GOT INTO MUSIC IN FOURTH GRADE, STARTED PLAYING GUITAR. THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO DO YOU. WENT RIGHT FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE. NO. MARK: HOW DID YOU GO FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO ACTING? THAT'S NOT EASY TO DO. I WAS PLAYING IN A ROCK BAND AND THE DRAMA TEACHER WALKED DOWN THE HALL AND TURNED AROUND AND SAID I'M DIRECTING WEST SIDE STORY, AND YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE GANG MEMBERS, SO COME AND AUDITION. SO I WENT IN. YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT LET'S SEE WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. I WENT TO THE AUDITION. THERE WERE A LOT OF PRETTY GIRLS GOING IN. I FOLLOWED THEM IN, AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT AN AUDITION WAS. THEY GAVE ME A SCRIPT AND I STARTED STUMBLING THROUGH IT. IT WAS FUNNY WHAT I WAS DOING, I WAS GETTING LAUGHS AND GOT CAST IN A PLAY. AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE PLAY AND THEATER, AND YOU KNOW, I WAS STRUGGLING IN SCHOOL, SO I WAS HAVING A HARD TIME IN SCHOOL, AND YET I FOUND THIS THING THEY COULD DO, AND THAT I REALLY ENJOYED DOING. SO FROM THAT MOMENT ON, I WANTED TO BE IN PLAYS ALL THE TIME. AND I AUDITIONED AND I WAS PLAYING MUSIC AND GET IN THE PLAYS, AND AFTER HIGH SCHOOL, INCIDENTALLY I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH CREDITS TO GRADUATE WITH MY CLASS. I HAD TO GO BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL AND GRADUATE WITH THE FOLLOWING CLASS BECAUSE I WASN'T DOING WELL, BUT I WAS GOOD AT ACTING. AND WHEN I GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL, I STARTED A THEATER COMPANY WITH SOME OF THE KIDS THERE. IT'S CALLED STEPPEN WOLF THEATER, IT'S BEEN AROUND ALMOST 35 YEARS NOW. IT'S GROWN INTO SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE A CHICAGO INSTITUTION, AND WE'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS AND IT ALL STARTED WITH KIDS, YOU KNOW, IN HIGHLAND PARK WHO WANTED TO DO PLAYS. WHEN WAS THE FIRST BREAK? WHEN DID THAT COME? YOU KNOW, IT DEPENDS. THERE WERE A SERIES OF THEM. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT KIND OF HELPED TO MOVE STEPPENWOLF THEATRE FROM A LOCAL, CHICAGO BASED COMPANY, THAT WAS ONLY KNOWN THERE TO A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED COMPANY IS WHEN WE MOVED ONE OF OUR PLAYS FROM CHICAGO TO NEW YORK, AND WE DID IT OFF BROADWAY. JOHN MAL KWICH WAS IN IT, WE DID IT FOR SIX MONTHS, ALL OF A SUDDEN STEPPENWOLF WENT FROM A LOCAL THEATER TO INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED THEATER, WHEN YOU GO TO NO, YOU DO A PLAY, YOU GET REVIEWED BY THE "NEW YORK TIMES," AND ALL KINDS OF INTERNATIONAL PUBLICATION, ALL OF A SUDDEN WE WENT FROM SOMETHING SMALL TO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT BIGGER, AND I WAS RECOGNIZED AS SOMEBODY WHO CAN DIRECT AND YOU KNOW, THAT STARTED THE NEXT BUT THEN I WENT OUT TO CALIFORNIA. MARK: AND THE REST IS HISTORY. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THIS. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS IS A FAIR QUESTION. WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE THAT YOU WERE IN? EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR MAIN MOVIES, BUT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY FOR YOU, THE MOST CHALLENGING ROLE, THE MOST FULFILLING ROLE. WELL, FULFILLING, THERE'S A BUNCH OF THEM. MARK: I'LL GIVE YOU MINE, ONE OF MINE. OKAY. MARK: AND THIS IS ALMOST COUNTERINTUITIVE BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M PRO COP. RANSOM. YOU SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME IN THAT MOVIE. THE COP RUN AMOK. MARK: THAT WAS A SCARY MOVIE. AND TA WAS A GOOD ONE, IT WAS REALLY, REALLY WELL DIRECTED BY RON HOWARD, VERY TENSE THRILLER. I ORIGINALLY DID NOT WANT TO PLAY THAT PART. RON ASKED ME TO DO IT, AND I JUST COULDN'T SEE MYSELF DOING IT. I HAD SMALL CHILDREN, IT'S ABOUT A GUY WHO TAKES A CHILD, AND I JUST HATED THE CHARACTER WHEN I READ, IT SO I PASSED ON IT AND IT CAME AROUND AGAIN AND I TOOK IT, AND THEN IT WAS FUN TO BE EVIL, FUN TO BE THE BAD GUY. OF COURSE, I GET PAID BACK IN THE END OF THE MOVIE. THAT WAS A GOOD ONE CERTAINLY. FORREST GUMP WAS A LIFE CHANGING FILM IN MANY WAYS. VETERANS WORK, AND I HADN'T DONE MANY MOVIES WHEN I DID THAT. MARK: YOU HIT A POINT RIGHT THERE. YOU ARE SO ACTIVE NOW IN THE VETERANS MOVEMENT, BUT NOT JUST THAT, POLICE, FIREFIGHTERS, PUBLIC SAFETY. FORREST GUMP REALLY WAS A TURNING POINT FOR YOU IN THAT RESPECT, WASN'T IT? WELL, IT WAS SOMETHING THAT LED ME TO BEGIN TO SUPPORT OUR WOUNDED VETERANS, BECAUSE I WAS PLAYING THE WOUNDED VETERAN. PRIOR TO THAT, I HAD BEEN SUPPORTING VIETNAM VETERANS, GOING BACK TO THE 80s VIETNAM VETERANS MY FAMILY, I GOT INVOLVED WITH VIETNAM VETERANS IN THE MID 80s IN THE CHICAGO AREA SUPPORTING THEM LOCALLY. THIS WAS AT A TIME THAT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR OUR VIETNAM VETERANS. WALL WAS PUT UP IN 1982. WE STARTED TO HAVE WELCOME HOME PARADES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AROUND 1984 AND 85 BUT VIETNAM VETERANS WERE LIVING IN THE SHADOWS, THEY WERE STILL STRUGGLING. THEY WERE STILL HAVING DIFFICULTY AND I STARTED TO SUPPORT THEM LOCALLY IN CHICAGO, AND IN THE 90s I GOT TO PLAY THE VIETNAM VETERAN, AND HE WAS A WOUNDED SOLDIER AND I GOT TO START WORKING WITH THE DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS ASSOCIATION IN '94. SO FORREST GUMP WAS CERTAINLY A VERY, VERY GOOD ROLE TO PLAY IN MANY WAYS. IF YOU ASK ME AGAIN WHAT SOME OF THE MOST CHALLENGING STUFF? I PLAY THE GOVERNOR OF ALABAMA, GEORGE WALLACE IN A TNT TELEVISION FILM DIRECTED BY JOHN FRANKENHARMER IN 1997 AND THAT WAS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST ROLE THEY HAD DONE, CERTAINLY PROBABLY TO DATE. IT WAS AN OVER THREE-HOUR, TWO-NIGHT MINI-SERIES AND TOOK ABOUT 20 YEARS OF HIS LIFE. ANGELINA WAS A YOUNG ACTRESS AT THAT TIME. SHE WAS 21. ANGELINA JOLIE. MARK: YOU REMEMBER THAT ROLE. NOBODY KNEW WHO SHE WAS. MARK: YOU REMEMBER THAT ROLE WHY. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT ROLE? GEORGE WALLACE? I THINK I WAS IN EVERY SINGLE FRAME OF THE MOVIE. IT WAS CALLED GEORGE WALLACE AND I WAS PLAYING GEORGE WALLACE. AND FORREST GUMP, FOR EXAMPLE, I'M IN THE MOVIE FOR MAYBE 20 MINUTES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THERE'S MAYBE 25 MINUTES, THERE'S FOUR OR FIVE SEGMENTS THAT ARE LIEUTENANT DAN, BUT THERE'S A BIG, BIG STORY OF ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE IN FORREST GUMP. GEORGE WALLACE AND HARRY TRUMAN, I PLAYED HARRY TRUMAN AS WELL IN AN HBO MOVIE. THOSE MOVIES WERE FOCUSED ON THAT CHARACTER AND I HAD TO CARRY THOSE FILMS IN A WAY THAT A SUPPORTING CHARACTER LIKE LIEUTENANT DAN OR EVEN RANSOM, DOES NOT HAVE TO DO. RANSOM WAS STARRING MEL GIBSON. HE WAS CARRYING THE MOVIE. BOTH TRUMAN AND WALLACE WERE MOVIES THAT RELIED HEAVILY ON PERFORMANCE AND I HAD TO REALLY STEP UP. MARK: AND YOU'VE PRETTY MUCH MOVED ON TO WHAT IS YOUR PASSION, THE TROOPS, THE POLICE, THE FIREFIGHTERS, THE VETS. BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT, DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE FOREVER ABANDONING ACTING? NO, NO, I CAN'T SAY THAT. I'M GOING TO DO A SMALL PART THIS SUMMER IN A FILM THAT DIRECTORED WANTED ME TO DO, VERY SMALL PART. BUT IT'S IN HAWAII. MARK: DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER PART? I'LL COME WITH YOU. BUT YOUR REAL FOCUS NOW IS ON THE OTHER, CORRECT? YES. YEAH. MARK: AND YOU IS THAT A DETERMINATION YOU MADE OR THIS JUST CAME ABOUT OR SOME POINT OF YOUR LIFE YOU SAID I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON MY FOUNDATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND CAN DO A LITTLE BIT OF ACTING BUT CAN'T DO A WHOLE LOT OF BOTH? WELL, THERE'S A BLESSING THAT I'VE HAD WHICH IS SOME SUCCESS IN THE MOVIE BUSINESS AND TELEVISION BUSINESS. I WAS ON TELEVISION ON TWO TELEVISION SERIES, ONE FOR NINE YEARS, THE OTHER FOR TWO YEARS, THAT'S 11 YEARS ON TELEVISION, AND THAT PUT ME IN A DIFFERENT PLACE IN TERMS OF WHAT I COULD DO BOTH FINANCIALLY TO SUPPORT OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM, AND TIMEWISE. I CAN AFFORD TO TAKE THAT TIME TO GO OUT AND DO THESE TYPES OF THINGS, BECAUSE I OWNED A PIECE OF THAT SHOW. CSI NEW YORK, SO I DID WELL ON IT. AND IT CAME AT A TIME WHERE I WAS JUST IT WAS POST SEPTEMBER 11TH AND I STARTED TO RAMP UP ACTIVITIES IN TERMS OF HOW I COULD SUPPORT THE MEN AND WOMEN DEPLOYING TO AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ AND WHAT I WANTED TO DO TO HELP THEM THROUGH THE DIFFICULT TIMES, AND THINGS JUST GOT HARDER AND HARDER FOR THEM, AS THE CONFLICT IN IRAQ TOOK A TURN, YOU KNOW. NOT IN THE DIRECTION THAT WE WANTED IT TO. OUR MEN AND WOMEN WERE CAUGHT IN THERE AND THEY NEEDED SOME SUPPORT, AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY GOT THE SUPPORT THEY NEEDED, UNLIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR VIETNAM VETERANS WHEN THEY GOT CAUGHT IN THE POLITICAL MUCK OF THAT PARTICULAR CONFLICT, AND THEY SUFFERED. AND HAVING VIETNAM VETERANS IN MY FAMILY AND HAVING BEEN INVOLVED WITH VIETNAM VETERANS OVER THE YEARS, I DID NOT WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN TO THIS POST-9/11 GENERATION OF WARRIOR, GOING OVER IN REACTION TO WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT TERRIBLE DAY. I WANTED TO SUPPORT THEM WITH EVERYTHING I HAD, AND TURNED
