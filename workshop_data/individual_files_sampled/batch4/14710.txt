celebrities jumped on the bandwagon tweeting their support of national walkout day now you all remember me discussing this last week thousands of high schoolers walked out of high school in protest of gun violence in their schools now a peaceful protest I think is a fantastic thing looking for solutions is wonderful but I don't think that they were looking for solutions plural their one goal their one solution is gun control and that won't work banning a ours isn't going to stop sociopaths from killing people with that weapon they'll find another gun there are plenty of other more lethal options out there 300 Winchester Magnum 50 BMG 408 cheytac remington 25.6 270 winchester this was a protest with one goal in mind and it wasn't the goal of sitting down with people with varying and maybe opposing views but that's what happens when your movement is fueled by organizations like moveon.org the women's march and wait for it Planned Parenthood that's rich right an organization that utilizes an overwhelming majority of their funding to end the lives of babies are not protesting on behalf of sustaining the lives of teenagers but I digress celebrities tweeting support today had a lot of things to say to these teenagers Mariska Hargitay tweeted we support all the students hashtag rising up to protest hashtag gun violence and in today's hashtag March for our lives we are proud of this generations inner strength and fearless gumption to let it shine you are the change we wish to see in the world thank you wow that's a lot of hashtags she must have been looking for some retweets or something Katy Perry tweeted on the one month anniversary of the Parkland school shooting students are walking out in protests of Congress's failure to act on gun violence let's support them and the march to washington DC in 10 days hashtag march our lives emmy rossum also tweeted to all the kids walking out of school today you are strong and powerful and we love you yeah strong and powerful sure but I also think that they're all a week out from Spring Break and they just got an extra day a vacation score now as I tweeted this morning if I had persisted in a walkout and ditched school when I was 16 my parents would have kicked my tail and rightfully so but these celebrities tweeting about this I would wager most of which have the luxury of living in fortified mansions inside gated communities can and often do employ the use of armed bodyguards they have the audacity to suggest taking guns away from normal everyday law-abiding Americans and how many of these celebrities glorify guns in their movies or TV shows they rake in seven or eight figure paychecks from a movie that propagates and glorifies gun violence with no repercussions or cognitive dissonance because I truly do believe that they don't see anything wrong with this so protection for me but not for thee that should be the new slogan in Hollywood so let's say tear down that Hollywood sign and replace it with that thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.fafsa.ed.gov
