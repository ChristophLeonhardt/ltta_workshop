MORNING LAST NIGHT.

59
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:07,312
>> WE WANT TO THINK KIM JONG UN

60
00:02:07,312 --> 00:02:12,050
WHO REALLY WAS EXCELLENT TO

61
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,051
THESE THREE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.

62
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:15,787
THEY ARE REALLY INCREDIBLE

63
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:16,421
PEOPLE.

64
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:18,857
THE FACT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO

65
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:21,193
GET THEM OUT SO SOON WAS REALLY

66
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:24,296
A TRIBUTE TO A LOT OF THINGS,

67
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:25,130
INCLUDING A CERTAIN PROCESS

68
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,866
THAT'S TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW.

69
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:28,834
IN THAT PROCESS IS VERY

70
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:29,501
IMPORTANT.

71
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:30,669
SO WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

72
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:33,138
WE HAVE A MEETING SCHEDULED IN A

73
00:02:33,138 --> 00:02:33,905
VERY SHORT.

74
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:34,339
LACK OF TIME.

75
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:36,141
YOU'LL BE HEARING ABOUT IT SOON.

76
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:40,612
WE HAVE THE LOCATION SET AND WE

77
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:42,647
WILL SEE IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING

78
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:44,649
PEOPLE DO NOT THINK WAS GOING TO

79
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:46,051
HAPPEN FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

80
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:48,553
A LOT OF BAD THINGS COULD HAVE

81
00:02:48,553 --> 00:02:49,421
HAPPENED IN BETWEEN.

82
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:51,223
>> Sean: THIS WAS A VERY

83
00:02:51,223 --> 00:02:52,324
IMPORTANT DIPLOMATIC VICTORY.

84
00:02:52,324 --> 00:02:56,461
WE KNOW THE DANGER THESE THREE

85
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:57,863
AMERICANS FACE BECAUSE WE SAW

86
00:02:57,863 --> 00:03:00,198
WHAT HAPPENED TO OTTO WARMBIER,

87
00:03:00,198 --> 00:03:00,899
THE AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENT

88
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:02,067
HELD CAPTIVE IN NORTH KOREA

89
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:02,768
WHICH ULTIMATELY CAUSED HIS

90
00:03:02,768 --> 00:03:05,270
HORRIFIC DEATH.

91
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,638
THE OTTO WARMBIER FAMILY REMAIN

92
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:07,472
IN OUR PRAYERS.

93
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:09,474
TONIGHT WE HAVE A REASON TO FEEL

94
00:03:09,474 --> 00:03:10,075
HOPEFUL AND PROUD.

95
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:13,078
THREE AMERICAN LIVES WERE LIKELY

96
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:15,147
SAVED AND WE DIDN'T HAVE TO

97
00:03:15,147 --> 00:03:16,648
BRIBE KIM JONG UN OR SEND

98
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:18,049
PALLETS OF CASH TO NORTH KOREA

99
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:19,618
TO GET THE JOB DONE.

100
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:23,488
SLOW IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, AS

101
00:03:23,488 --> 00:03:25,257
CORRUPT AS THEY ARE, THEY MERELY

102
00:03:25,257 --> 00:03:29,261
YAWNED TODAY.

103
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:30,896
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" BURIED THE

104
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:31,196
STORY.

105
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:31,730
ABC NEWS CRITICIZED

106
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,399
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON IRAN.

107
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:36,401
THE LIBERAL SENATOR FROM

108
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:37,869
NEW YORK CHUCK SCHUMER WAS LESS

109
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:38,870
THAN PLEASED.

110
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,204
REALLY?

111
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:40,705
THREE AMERICANS SAVED, BACK

112
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:41,072
HOME.

113
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:43,608
YOU ARE NOT PLEASE, YOU ARE NOT

114
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:43,909
HAPPY?

115
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:45,744
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

116
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:46,945
>> THE EXULTATION BY THE

117
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:48,380
PRESIDENT AND OTHERS OF THE

118
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,215
GREATNESS OF NORTH KOREA DOING

119
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:53,051
THIS EVADES ME.

120
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:56,221
HE CAN'T BE FOOLED INTO GIVING

121
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:57,389
THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME CREDIT

122
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:58,056
FOR RETURNING AMERICANS THAT

123
00:03:58,056 --> 00:04:01,159
NEVER SHOULD'VE BEEN DETAINED IN

124
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,061
THEIR FIRST PLACE.

125
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:05,163
AMERICAN CITIZENS ARE NOT

126
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:08,300
DIPLOMATIC BARGAINING CHIPS.

127
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,267
THERE REALLY SHOULD NOT BE

128
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:09,601
EXALTED.

129
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:11,536
IT SHOULD BE EXPECTED.

130
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:15,474
IT IS NO GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT OF

131
00:04:15,474 --> 00:04:16,074
KIM JONG UN TO DO THIS.

132
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:20,111
WHEN THE PRESIDENT DOES IT, HE

133
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:23,482
WEAKENS AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY

134
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:24,115
AND PUTS AMERICANS AT RISK

135
00:04:24,115 --> 00:04:25,984
AROUND THE WORLD.

136
00:04:25,984 --> 00:04:27,886
>> Sean: WHAT DO YOU THINK

137
00:04:27,886 --> 00:04:28,286
ABOUT THIS?

138
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:30,722
A FRIEND OF MINE, GREAT DOCTOR,

139
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:32,057
BRAIN SURGEON, TALK ABOUT THIS

140
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:32,858
EARLIER.

141
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:34,059
HE SAID WHAT A JERK.

142
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:36,695
THIS COMES FROM ONE OF THE

143
00:04:36,695 --> 00:04:37,562
SMARTEST, BRIGHTEST BRAIN

144
00:04:37,562 --> 00:04:38,096
SURGEON THE WORLD.

145
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:39,698
YOU ARE RIGHT.

146
00:04:39,698 --> 00:04:42,567
THIS IS ONE SAD CASE OF TRUMP

147
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:44,069
DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.

148
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:45,537
CHUCKIE, IT'S OKAY TO BE PROUD

149
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:46,271
OF YOUR COUNTRY.

150
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:47,472
LIVES WERE SAVED.

151
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:48,473
WHILE SCHUMER IS WHINING,

152
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:49,174
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CONTINUOUS

153
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:51,943
PUSH FOR PEACE ULTIMATELY IN THE

154
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:52,878
KOREAN PENINSULA.

155
00:04:52,878 --> 00:04:54,045
TODAY HE MADE AN IMPORTANT

156
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:57,015
ANNOUNCEMENT HE TWEETED:

157
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:57,749
"THE HIGHLY ANTICIPATED MEETING

158
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:58,450
BETWEEN KIM JONG UN AND MYSELF

159
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,184
WILL TAKE PLACE IN SINGAPORE ON

160
00:04:59,184 --> 00:04:59,551
JUNE 12TH.

161
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:00,218
WE WILL BOTH TRY TO MAKE IT

162
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:00,785
A VERY SPECIAL MOMENT

163
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:05,090
FOR WORLD PEACE!"

164
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,024
OF COURSE WE CAN'T PREDICT THE

165
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:07,792
FUTURE.

166
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:11,096
KIM JONG UN IS FRANKLY AND

167
00:05:11,096 --> 00:05:11,696
UNTRUSTWORTHY.

168
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:13,498
COME, UNBREAKABLE DESPERATE.

169
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:14,399
GIVEN ALL NORTH KOREA'S

170
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,200
CONCESSIONS, WE HAVE REASON TO

171
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,704
BE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC.

172
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:21,106
THE KOREAN PENINSULA PROGRESSING

173
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:22,073
TOWARDS PEACE.

174
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:23,308
TENSIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST ARE

175
00:05:23,308 --> 00:05:24,910
RISING, AS WE REPORTED LAST

176
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,311
NIGHT, THE ISRAELI DEFENSE

177
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:28,113
FORCES I NOTICED THAT IRAN FIRED

178
00:05:28,113 --> 00:05:30,682
OVER A DOZEN MISSILES FROM SYRIA

179
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:31,283
INTO ISRAEL FROM THEIR

180
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:33,885
INSTALLATIONS IN SYRIA.

181
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:36,288
NO CASUALTIES, THANKFULLY, WE

182
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:37,055
REPORTED.

183
00:05:37,055 --> 00:05:39,090
THE IRON DOME INTERCEPTED MANY

184
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:39,491
PROJECTILES.

185
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:41,326
HOURS AGO ISRAEL RIGHTFULLY

186
00:05:41,326 --> 00:05:43,862
RESPONDING IN A MASSIVE WAY,

187
00:05:43,862 --> 00:05:45,196
LAUNCHING A FULL-SCALE AERIAL

188
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:46,698
ATTACK AGAINST IRAN'S FORCES IN

189
00:05:46,698 --> 00:05:47,499
SYRIA, AND THEY TOOK OUT DOZENS

190
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:52,304
OF MILITARY SITES, ANTIAIRCRAFT

191
00:05:52,304 --> 00:05:53,071
BATTERIES AND REPORTEDLY KILLING

192
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:54,072
DOZENS OF THOSE THAT ARE

193
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:56,074
COMMITTING THESE ACTS OF TERROR.

194
00:05:56,074 --> 00:05:57,075
UNLIKE MANY COUNTRIES, ISRAEL

195
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:58,877
CAN NEVER PUT THEIR GUARD DOWN.

196
00:05:58,877 --> 00:06:00,312
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT LUXURY.

197
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:01,680
WHEN IT RAINS ON ISRAEL, THERE

198
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,848
WILL BE A FLOOD ON ISRAEL'S

199
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:04,182
ENEMIES.

200
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:05,984
THIS CONFLICT WITH IRAN IS NO

201
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:06,351
DIFFERENT.

202
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:08,320
IN FACT, IRAN'S INVOLVEMENT IN

203
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,688
PROXY WARS ALL OVER THE

204
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:10,755
MIDDLE EAST HAS LONG BEEN A

205
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:11,790
THREAT TO THE SECURITY AND THE

206
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,327
PEACE OF THE ISRAELI PEOPLE AND

207
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:16,261
OF COURSE AMERICAN TROOPS THAT

208
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:18,163
ARE STATIONED IN SYRIA, IRAQ,

209
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:19,064
AND ELSEWHERE.

210
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:22,267
YOU HAVE THE MULLAHS OF IRAN

211
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:23,868
LONG CHANTING DEATH TO AMERICA,

212
00:06:23,868 --> 00:06:25,403
DEATH TO ISRAEL, BURNING OUR

213
00:06:25,403 --> 00:06:26,271
FLIGHT, BURNING THEIR FLAG.

214
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:28,873
THEY BACK UP THOSE WORDS BY

215
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:30,508
WHITE, FINDING THE MOST RADICAL

216
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:31,743
TERRORISTS IN THE WORLD, SENDING

217
00:06:31,743 --> 00:06:33,878
TRAINED FIGHTERS ALL OVER THE

218
00:06:33,878 --> 00:06:35,847
MIDDLE EAST TO KILL OUR SOLDIERS

219
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:39,884
IN IRAQ AND OUR ALLY'S SOLDIERS.

220
00:06:39,884 --> 00:06:41,886
THIS IS A CHEAP REASON FOR THE

221
00:06:41,886 --> 00:06:43,088
CURRENT MILITARY STRIKE IN SYRIA

222
00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:45,390
AND LIKELY PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN

223
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,258
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S RIGHT DECISION

224
00:06:47,258 --> 00:06:47,959
TO PULL OUT OF THAT HORRIFIC

225
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,061
IRANIAN DEAL.

226
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:51,796
A FEW MOMENTS AGO, THE PRESIDENT

227
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:54,065
WRAPPED UP THE RALLY IN INDIANA.

228
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:54,866
HE SPOKE ABOUT IRAN AND

229
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:58,069
NORTH KOREA AND SO MUCH MORE.

230
00:06:58,069 --> 00:06:58,570
TAKE A LOOK.

231
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:03,708
>> ON JUNE 12, IN SINGAPORE, I

232
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:07,278
WILL BE MEETING WITH KIM JONG UN

233
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:10,081
TO PURSUE A FUTURE OF PEACE AND

234
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,883
SECURITY FOR THE WORLD, FOR THE

235
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:12,917
WHOLE WORLD.

236
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,419
BUT YOU REMEMBER, EVERYBODY, IN

237
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:16,721
THE FAKE NEWS WHEN THEY WERE

238
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:17,489
SAYING HE'S GOING TO GET US INTO

239
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:20,458
A NUCLEAR WAR!

240
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,359
HE'S GOING TO GET US INTO A

241
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:25,730
NUCLEAR WAR.

242
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,200
AND YOU KNOW WHAT GETS YOU INTO

243
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,702
NUCLEAR WARS AND YOU KNOW WHAT

244
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:35,473
GETS YOU INTO OTHER WARS:

245
00:07:35,473 --> 00:07:36,307
WEAKNESS.

246
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:39,077
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY

247
00:07:39,077 --> 00:07:41,479
BIG SUCCESS, BUT MY ATTITUDE IS,

248
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:43,882
AND IF IT ISN'T, IT ISN'T, OKAY.

249
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:46,584
IF IT IS THE END, IT ISN'T BUT,

250
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:47,252
AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT

251
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:49,187
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW.

252
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:51,756
WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE WALKING

253
00:07:51,756 --> 00:07:53,925
INTO AN IRAN DEAL WHERE THE

254
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:56,895
NEGOTIATORS JOHN KERRY REFUSED

255
00:07:56,895 --> 00:08:00,932
TO LEAVE THE TABLE.

256
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:10,775
OBAMA, PRESIDENT OBAMA.

257
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:17,415
PAID 1.8 BILLION FOR HOSTAGES.

258
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:21,352
YOU, NOT ME, YOU.

259
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:23,888
LAST NIGHT YOU SIGHED AND BEGAN

260
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:25,490
ITS LEADING TO SOME VERY BIG

261
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,361
THINGS, AND I THINK THAT

262
00:08:30,361 --> 00:08:34,799
KIM JONG UN, KIM JONG UN DID A

263
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,168
GREAT SERVICE TO HIMSELF, TO HIS

264
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:39,404
COUNTRY BY DOING THIS.

265
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:45,577
BUT THOSE HOSTAGES CAME OUT WITH

266
00:08:45,577 --> 00:08:46,144
RESPECT.

267
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:47,112
WE DIDN'T PAY FOR THEM.

268
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:48,413
WE'RE GOING TO SET THE TABLE.

269
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:52,484
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A GREAT DEAL

270
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:53,218
FOR THE WORLD FOR NORTH KOREA,

271
00:08:53,218 --> 00:08:59,023
FOR SOUTH KOREA, FOR JAPAN, FOR

272
00:08:59,023 --> 00:08:59,491
CHINA.

273
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:01,092
>> Sean: TOUTING THE KEY TO

274
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:02,427
VELTMAN'S ON THE WORLD STAGE,

275
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:03,361
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE IS

00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:04,696
BACKING THEM UP RIGHT HERE AT

277
00:09:04,696 --> 00:09:05,530
HOME.

278
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,098
DURING THE INTERVIEW EARLIER

279
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:08,199
TODAY, THE VICE PRESIDENT TOLD

280
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:09,968
ABC THAT IT'S TIME FOR MUELLER'S

281
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:11,669
WITCH HUNT, AND I AGREE

282
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:12,437
COMPLETELY, TO COME TO AN END.

283
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:15,673
TAKE A LOOK.

284
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:17,976
>> OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN

285
00:09:17,976 --> 00:09:19,944
FULLY COOPERATING WITH THE

286
00:09:19,944 --> 00:09:20,411
SPECIAL COUNSEL.

287
00:09:20,411 --> 00:09:21,880
>> DO YOU THINK THE

288
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,881
INVESTIGATION IS A HOAX?

289
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:23,948
>> WE WILL CONTINUE TO.

290
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:26,518
WHAT I THINK IS THAT IT'S BEEN

291
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:28,620
ABOUT A YEAR SINCE THIS

292
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,688
INVESTIGATION BEGAN.

293
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:32,290
OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED

294
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,291
OVER A MILLION DOCUMENTS.

295
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,492
WE FULLY COOPERATED AND IT IN

296
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:35,927
THE INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY, I

297
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:37,896
THINK IT'S TIME TO WRAP IT UP.

298
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:39,764
>> Sean: TIME TO WRAP IT UP, I

299
00:09:39,764 --> 00:09:40,131
AGREE.

300
00:09:40,131 --> 00:09:41,332
MEANWHILE ACCORDING TO SOME

301
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:42,801
STELLAR REPORTING, GET FROM OUR

302
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:47,238
OWN SARA CARTER, WE KNOW THAT

303
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:49,307
THE FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES

304
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:50,108
COMEY, THE ONE ROD ROSENSTEIN'S

305
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:52,310
HAD TO FIRE, HE CONSULTED WITH

306
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,344
TEAM MUELLER BEFORE GIVING ANY

307
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:54,412
TESTIMONY TO CONGRESS ABOUT ITS

308
00:09:54,412 --> 00:09:58,716
INQUIRY INTO RUSSIA.

309
00:09:58,716 --> 00:10:00,785
CAN ANYONE SAY COLLUSION OR

310
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:02,821
COLLABORATION, INAPPROPRIATE?

311
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:05,290
JUDICIAL WATCH HAS ACQUIRED THE

312
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,925
EMAILS THAT SHOW COORDINATION IN

313
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:08,793
THESE EFFORTS BETWEEN THE OFFICE

314
00:10:08,793 --> 00:10:10,061
OF SPECIAL COUNSEL AND THE

315
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:11,696
DISGRACED FORMER FBI DIRECTOR.

316
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:13,932
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU HAVE DEEP

317
00:10:13,932 --> 00:10:14,399
STATE NEWS HERE.

318
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,768
REMEMBER LAST NIGHT WHEN WE

319
00:10:16,768 --> 00:10:18,536
REPORTED THE MEETING BETWEEN ROD

320
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:19,671
ROSENSTEIN, INTEL COMMITTEE

321
00:10:19,671 --> 00:10:21,739
CHAIR DEVIN NUNES, AND OVERSIGHT

322
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:22,907
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN TREY GOWDY.

323
00:10:22,907 --> 00:10:23,741
THAT MEETING WAS CLASSIFIED BUT

324
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:28,112
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO ADDRESS THE

325
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:29,247
DOJ'S ONGOING STONEWALLING, SLOW

326
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,381
WALKING OF DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE

327
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:31,883
BEEN SUBPOENAED BY CONGRESS.

328
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:33,785
OH, THEN THEY GIVE THE PHONY

329
00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:34,319
REDACTION.

330
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:36,821
OH, AND THEY'D DELAY DELAY,

331
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:37,121
DELAY.

332
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:38,923
THEN THEY SAY NO.

333
00:10:38,923 --> 00:10:39,691
ACCORDING TO A BRAND-NEW ARTICLE

334
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:41,526
FROM SARA CARTER, THIS COULD BE

335
00:10:41,526 --> 00:10:42,894
JUST AN EFFORT TO BUY TIME FOR

336
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:45,296
SESSIONS AND ROSENSTEIN.

337
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:46,331
WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THIS LATER

338
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:47,298
IN THE SHOW.

339
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:48,867
THIS STUFF IS NOT FUN.

340
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:50,268
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT

341
00:10:50,268 --> 00:10:50,768
TO KNOW.

342
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:52,170
THE CONSTITUTION GIVES CONGRESS

343
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,672
THAT OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY.

344
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:56,074
MAKE NO MISTAKE.

345
00:10:56,074 --> 00:10:58,009
WE ON THIS PROGRAM, WILL HOLD

346
00:10:58,009 --> 00:10:59,878

WE HAVE NEW DEVELOPMENTS

354
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:11,489
SURROUNDING THE CONFIRMATION

355
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:12,490
PROCESS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP PICK

356
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,691
TO HEAD THE CIA.

357
00:11:13,691 --> 00:11:15,927
HER NAME, YOU SEE RIGHT THERE,

358
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:17,629
AN AMAZING APPEARANCE BEFORE

359
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:17,996
CONGRESS.

360
00:11:17,996 --> 00:11:18,897
GINA HASPEL.

361
00:11:18,897 --> 00:11:19,898
DEMOCRATS ARE OPPOSING HER

362
00:11:19,898 --> 00:11:22,700
BECAUSE THEY THINK THE ENHANCED

363
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,302
INTERROGATION PROGRAM SHE

364
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:26,504
OVERSAW WAS TOO TOUGH ON

365
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:27,238
TERRORISTS LIKE KHALID SHEIKH

366
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:27,605
MOHAMMED.

367
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:29,908
THE GUY THAT WAS THE MASTERMIND

368
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:30,708
BEHIND 9/11.

369
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,376
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT

00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:32,410
DICK CHENEY, HE'S NOT BUYING IT.

371
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,312
HE IS DEAD ON ACCURATE.

372
00:11:34,312 --> 00:11:35,313
EARLIER TODAY, HE CAME OUT

373
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:36,381
SWINGING.

374
00:11:36,381 --> 00:11:38,116
GOOD FOR THE FORMER

375
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:38,583
VICE PRESIDENT.

376
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,183
WATCH THIS.

377
00:11:39,183 --> 00:11:42,687
>> WHAT WE DID WAS IN FACT AND

378
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:45,556
CONSISTENT WITH OUR FUNDAMENTAL

379
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:47,492
STATUTES.

380
00:11:47,492 --> 00:11:48,293
IT WORKED.

381
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:50,895
I THINK WHAT WE DID HELPED

382
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:51,863
ULTIMATELY PRODUCE THE

383
00:11:51,863 --> 00:11:53,665
INTELLIGENCE WE NEEDED TO BE

384
00:11:53,665 --> 00:11:54,265
ABLE TO GET BIN LADEN.

385
00:11:54,265 --> 00:11:57,068
IF IT WERE MY CALL, I WOULD NOT

386
00:11:57,068 --> 00:11:57,735
DISCONTINUE THOSE PROGRAMS.

387
00:11:57,735 --> 00:11:58,469
I WOULD HAVE THEM ACTIVE AND

388
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:00,805
READY TO GO.

389
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:03,241
YOU TELL ME THAT THE ONLY METHOD

390
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:05,510
WE HAVE THIS PLEASE, PLEASE,

391
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,545
PRETTY PLEASE TELL US WHAT YOU

392
00:12:07,545 --> 00:12:07,845
KNOW.

393
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:09,514
I DON'T BUY THAT.

394
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:10,615
I THINK THE TECHNIQUES WE USE

395
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:12,884
WERE NOT TORTURED.

396
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:14,118
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO BACK AND

397
00:12:14,118 --> 00:12:14,819
TRY TO REWRITE HISTORY.

398
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:17,121
IF IT WERE MY CALL, IT WOULD DO

399
00:12:17,121 --> 00:12:17,655
IT AGAIN.

400
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:18,589
>> Sean: OF COURSE HE

401
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:20,558
VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY IS

402
00:12:20,558 --> 00:12:21,492
RIGHT.

403
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:22,193
INTERROGATION OF KHALID SHEIKH

404
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:24,929
MOHAMMED, IT LED TO THE COURIER.

405
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:26,097
THAT CAREER LETTUCE WHERE USAMA

406
00:12:26,097 --> 00:12:26,698
BIN LADEN WAS.

407
00:12:26,698 --> 00:12:27,332
IT'S TIME FOR DEMOCRATIC

408
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:29,934
SENATORS TO PUT THE SAFETY OF

409
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:31,602
YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AHEAD

410
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:33,104
OF THEIR PERSONAL HATRED OF

411
00:12:33,104 --> 00:12:33,838
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

412
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:36,808
WE NEED TO CONFIRM PEOPLE,

413
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:38,276
HEROES LIKE GINA HASPEL, AS SOON

414
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:39,744
AS POSSIBLE.

415
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:40,678
WITHOUT A DOUBT, SHE'S AN

416
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:41,112
AMERICAN HERO.

417
00:12:41,112 --> 00:12:43,314
SHE IS THE RIGHT CHOICE TO LEAD

418
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:44,082
THE CIA.

419
00:12:44,082 --> 00:12:46,317
BY THE WAY, CLAIRE McCASKILL,

420
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:47,285
WHERE ARE YOU?
