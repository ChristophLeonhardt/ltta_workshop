>> Neil: ONE OF THE MOST
POPULAR SEGMENTS ON MODERN
TELEVISION.
KIND OF.
ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THIS
A LITTLE EARLIER.
ALL SMILES FOR THE BIG PHOTO
OP.S.
YOU WOULD NEVER ASSUME THERE
ARE ANY PROBLEMS.
GOT TO TELL YOU G-7 SUMMIT
THE ODD MAN OUT IS THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
THAT SEEMS TO BE THE WAY HE
LIKES IT.
GET READ FROM YOUNG AND
FUNKY KIDS AND WE BEGIN WITH
THE FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT
LEAH GABRIEL.
I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE SAID
YES.
SO HAPPY SHE DID.
WE HAVE KAT TIMPF WITH US
RADIO SENSATION AND MY
FRIEND GUNS.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?
I DON'T KNOW.
IS HE GETTING INTO ODD
TERRITORY TWEETING ABOUT
ALLIES.
LIKE OPENLY AIRING HIS DIRTY
LAUNDRY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING
ON.
>> Neil: MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD
THING.
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?
A GOOD THING?
>> I THINK IT'S TRUMP BEING
TRUMP.
WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT THIS
BY NOW.
ONLY REASON THEY ARE MAD AT
US BECAUSE HIS POLICIES AND
EVERYTHING.
THE TERRORISTS ARE HELPING
US.
AND THEY ARE AFFECTING, YOU
KNOW, MACRON IN CANADA AND
GERMANY, THEIR ECONOMY.
SO I DON'T CARE SLONKS OUR
PRESIDENT
ASESIDENT
ASLOIDENT
ASLONGENT
ASLONG AT
ASLONG AS OUR PRESIDENT IS
LOOKING OUT FOR OURSELVES.
>> NO ONE SHOULD BE
SURPRISED BY THIS BECAUSE
DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN ALL
OVER THE PLACE ON A LOT OF
ISSUES.
HE HAS BEEN CONSISTENT ON
TARIFFS.
SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED HE IS
DOING.
THIS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT
I THINK AND WHAT MACRON OR
JUSTIN TRUDEAU THINKS.
HE IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE
HIS MIND.
>> Neil: DO YOU THIS WITH
YOUR FRIENDS.
>> I THINK THIS IS PAT WHO
PROMISED TO BRING HIS
BUSINESS STYLE TO THE WHITE
HOUSE.
THIS IS WHERE HE IS MOST
COMFORTABLE.
I THINK HE LIKES TO DO.
THIS ONLY PROBLEM HERE IN
SORT OF THE FREQUENT, YOU FREE
MARKET YOU CAN WALK AWAY
FROM THE DEAL FIND ANOTHER
COMPANY TO DO THE DEAL WITH.
YOU CAN'T SAY I'M GOING TO
FIND ANOTHER CANADA TO DEAL
WITH RIGHT NOW.
THE CHALLENGE HERE IS THIS
IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF DEAL
THAT HE IS DOING WITH
COUNTRIES RATHER THAN WITH
COMPANIES.
BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S JUST
THE WAY HE LIKES TO RUN
THINGS.
>> Neil: HOW ABOUT WE SPREAD
OURSELVES TOO THIN?
WE SEEM TO FIGHT WITH
EVERYBODY.
>> THERE IS ALWAYS THAT ONE
PERSON WHO WANTS TO GO AT
EVERYBODY.
>> IF THEY HAVE A VALID
POINT.
IN FACT, IF THE FAX BACK UP
WHAT HE SAYS.
>> Neil: I HAVE LOOKED AT
THESE NUMBERS.
HE HAS A LOT OF LEGITIMATE
BEEFS WITH THESE GUYS.
WE ARE ALSO DEALING WITH
CHINA AND NORTH KOREA.
GOT TO PICK AND CHOOSE.
>> PEOPLE ARE WORRIED THAT
WE ARE ISOLATING OURSELVES
FROM OUR FRIENDS.
SO MANY OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS
WITH OUR ALLIES COME DOWN TO
OUR DEFENSE WITH THEM AND
RELATIONSHIPS THAT WERE
FORGED THROUGH COMMON 70S.
AND I WILL TELL YOU OUR
ALLIES THEY ARE GOING TO BE
THERE FOR US WHEN THEY NEED
US.
THEY ARE GOING TO BE OUR
FRIENDS WHEN THEY NEED US.
>> Neil: YOU ARE VERY YOUNG
TO BE SO JADED.
>> HISTORICALLY TRUE.
I'M SURE NOT EVERYONE HAS
SEEN EYE TO EYE
HISTORICALLY.
MAYBE KEEPING UP APPEARANCES
THEY DO IN FRONT OF THE
CAMERAS AND BEHIND THE
SCENES.
>> NOTHING ANYONE CAN DO TO
CHANGE.
THIS IS HE GOING TO KEEP
TWEETING WHETHER YOU LIKE IT
OR NOT.
>> Neil: I WOULD BE REMISS
IN QUESTION MENTION IT
FIGHTING OVER THE PEOPLE WHO
COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND
DON'T GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
NBA CHAMPIONSHIP OVER THE
BASKETBALL ONE?
THE PRESIDENT ALREADY HAD
THIS TO SAY ABOUT A
POTENTIAL WHITE HOUSE VISIT
FROM THE WINNING TEAM.
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> I DIDN'T INVITE LEBRON
JAMES.
AND I DIDN'T INVITE STEPH
CURRY.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO INVITE
EITHER TEAM.
BUT WE HAVE OTHER TEAMS THAT
ARE COMING.
MY ATTITUDE, IF THEY WANT TO
BE HERE, IT'S THE GREATEST
PLACE ON EARTH.
I'M HERE.
IF THEY DON'T WANT TO BE
HERE, I DON'T WANT THEM.
>> Neil: WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT?
>> YOU KNOW, I AGREE WITH
THE PRESIDENT ON A LOT OF
THINGS.
HERE I DON'T THINK THE WHOLE
TEAM SHOULD BE PENEL
PENALIZED OR PUNISHED JUST
BECAUSE OF A COUPLE PLAYERS.
LAST YEAR WHEN THE ASTROS
WON BELL AND CORE
WON BELL.AND CORE
-- JUST BECAUSE HAVE YOU
LEBRON AND STEPH CURRY.
BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU DON'T
AGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT
DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T
RESPECT THE OFFICE OF THE
PRESIDENT.
>> Neil: HOTS FAULT IS IT.
>> GUILTY BY ASSOCIATION.
MOST OUTSPOKEN PEOPLE ON THE
TEAM SAYING THESE THINGS AND
TRUMP IS GOING TO TAKE IT TO
HEART AND THEN SAY YOU KNOW
WHAT?
NO ONE IS COMING THEN.
YOU RUINED IT FOR EVERYBODY.
EVERYBODY OUT OF THE POOL.
>> HE PROBABLY DIDN'T WANT
TO DEAL WITH IT I'M KIND OF
GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE
AVOIDED A WHOLE NEWS CYCLE
OF PEOPLE SAYING OH, I'M NOT
GOING TO GO TO THE WHITE
HOUSE.
>> DON'T WORRY, I DIDN'T
INVITE HIM.
>> EXACTLY.
YOU ARE NOT INVITED.
I KNOW IT'S A TRADITIONAL
THING LIKE HE DOESN'T GO TO
THE WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENTS DINNER NIP
THINGS IN THE BUD.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
IF PLAYERS ARE LIKE I REALLY
WANT TO GO TO THE WHITE
HOUSE HE WOULD BE LIKE COME
ON.
WHO WANTS TO HAVE SOMEBODY
OVER TO THEIR HOUSE FOR
DINNER IF THEY DON'T WANT TO
BE THERE.
>> Neil: BY DEFINITION.
>> I'M A WHOLE LOT OF FUN, I
SWEAR.
HE IS ANYTHING IT IN THE
BUD.
>> Neil: THIS REMINDS ME OF
LIFE ON MARS.
SEGWAY
SEGUAY
SEGUEY
SEGUE THERE?
INVESTIGATING.
THIS ROVER, THIS HAS BEEN
TRAVERSING THE MARTIAN
SURFACE NOW FOR THE BETTER
PART OF FIVE OR SIX YEARS.
ANYWAY, THEY SEEM TO HAVE
INDICATED NASA DISCOVERED
THE ELEMENTS BEEN THERE
BILLIONS OF YEARS AGO.
BIG DEAL.
ANOTHER CAPSULE BURROW
INSIDE THE PLANET.
WE ALWAYS LOOK FOR LIFE UP
THERE.
NOW THERE ARE INDICATIONS
THAT AT LEAST AT A TIME IT
MIGHT HAVE HAD IT.
>> I THINK THIS IS GREAT.
HOPE
FUPE
FULLY THIS WILL KICK START
THE WHOLE NASA AND GET US
BACK IT THE FOREFRONT.
THE LAST ADMINISTRATION
RELEVANT GATING NASA TO
SOLVE WHAT WAS HAPPENING
WITH CAR CRASH PROBLEMS.
>> WE GOT TO KEEP GOING.
I CALLED MY GOOD BUDDY BUZZ
AL DRESDEN ON
BU DRESDEN ON
BUZZRESDEN ON
BUZZALSDEN ON
BUZZALDREN ON
BUZZALDRIN ON THIS ONE.
>> SECOND MAN TO WALK ON THE
MOON.
>> DID I CALL HIM AND HE
SAID, LOOK, HE SAID WE HAVE
GOT TO EXPLORE.
IF WE DON'T EXPLORE WE
EXPIRE.
HE IS REALLY PASSIONATE
ABOUT GETTING A MANNED
MISSION TO MARS AND GETTING
PEOPLE BACK IN SPACE AND
LEADERSHIP AGAIN.
>> Neil: LIFE.
>> NOT JUST ANALYSIS IS A,
WE HAVE ALL THESE
BILLIONAIRES.
LIKE AS SOON AS YOU BECOME A
RICH DUDE ALL YOU WANT TO DO
IS GO TO SPACE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT AT
ALL.
>> Neil: IT'S THEIR MONEY.
>> I WANT TO SEND NANCY
PELOSI THERE.
GET HER OUT OF HERE.
>> Neil: EVERYTHING COMES
