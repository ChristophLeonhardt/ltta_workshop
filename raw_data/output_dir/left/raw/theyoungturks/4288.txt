00:00:00,243 --> 00:00:03,078
Earlier this week, The New York Times
uncovered a memo that features

2
00:00:03,078 --> 00:00:07,215
Trump’s new very important agenda
item: tackling affirmative action

3
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,484
and taking legal action against schools
that apply it. Now I’ll be talking about

4
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:13,686
all the problems with affirmative action
today. But before we get to that,

5
00:00:13,686 --> 00:00:16,454
let’s go back to Trump’s plea
to black people for a second:

6
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:23,826
“What do you have to lose, by trying
something new, like Trump?”

7
00:00:23,826 --> 00:00:27,763
Turns out, if you vote for a dude who
dog whistled to white supremacists

8
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:31,265
throughout his campaign- you’re 
slated to lose at least some things.

9
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:34,134
Things like affirmative action are
now on the chopping block.

10
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:38,003
Except it’s crucial to recognize that
this is only going to affect the poor

11
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:40,239
and the marginalized- for the
wealthy, it doesn’t really matter

12
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,508
if you’re under-qualified, you just toss
the school a couple of million dollars

13
00:00:43,508 --> 00:00:46,476
and your transcripts become just
a formality for admission to

14
00:00:46,476 --> 00:00:49,979
top colleges and universities.
And let’s take a look at Kushman-

15
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,548
Jared Kushner- who got into Harvard
after his father selflessly gave

16
00:00:53,548 --> 00:00:56,950
the school $2.5 million dollars.
Now this pay-to-play arrangement

17
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,319
at elite institutions is not exactly
a secret amongst the wealthy.

18
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:03,789
College endowments depend more
than ever on private donations,

19
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:07,258
since admitting low income geniuses
just doesn't really pay enough for

20
00:01:07,258 --> 00:01:10,760
the Scrooge McDuckian deans to
live on. But even when wealthy

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,962
white people don’t legally bribe
their way into college, they still

22
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:16,799
have an unfair advantage.
Their fallback option is relying

23
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,934
on “legacy” admissions, which give
preferential status to applicants

24
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:23,136
with a family connection to the school.
But you might say I’m colorblind

25
00:01:23,136 --> 00:01:28,606
and a legacy can be of any color, right?
Sure, except that it doesn’t and it wasn't

26
00:01:28,606 --> 00:01:33,410
until the Brown vs Board of Education 
in 1954 that schools were mandated

27
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,746
to desegregate. And to top that off,
that decision was ignored until

28
00:01:36,746 --> 00:01:40,749
a decade later when the Civil Rights
Act, that schools were actually forced

29
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:44,952
to integrate. Basically, “legacy admissions”
is code word for “Hey white people,

30
00:01:44,952 --> 00:01:48,154
"you can go to white college because 
your white family went to white college.”

31
00:01:48,154 --> 00:01:51,090
Now if it wasn't already obvious, 
legacy admissions is a system which

32
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,026
perpetuates itself based on prior
racial discrimination. And by prior,

33
00:01:55,026 --> 00:01:58,662
I mean just recently in history,
as in: Trump and Jeff Sessions

34
00:01:58,662 --> 00:02:04,365
were both still in school during segregation.
Obviously Sessions, never really left that era.

35
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:07,235
And now, Sessions with the help 
of Trump, is bringing back the good

36
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:11,138
ole’ days which includes some of 
worst policies for black people

37
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:12,305
in recent history.

38
00:02:12,305 --> 00:02:13,406
“What do you have to lose?”

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,107
“Bye-bye.”

40
00:02:15,107 --> 00:02:19,110
Jeff Beauregard Sessions III is one
of the worst things to happen to

41
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,846
black people since “Birth of a Nation.”
While “Birth of a Nation” made

42
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:26,381
the Klan seem cool and exacerbated
racial tensions, at least the film is more

43
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:29,417
than a hundred years old and no one
ever really watches it except for as

44
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:33,053
an example of how racist as fuck things
were back then, whereas Sessions,

45
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:37,089
the nation’s most powerful attorney, 
was deemed too racist to be a judge

46
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:41,526
in the eighties. In. The. Eighties.
The eighties were racist as fuck.

47
00:02:41,526 --> 00:02:44,728
How racist do you have to be to
be called a racist in the 80s?

48
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:46,063
“I am not a racist!”

49
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:50,899
Jeffrey, the fact that you had to say this 
during a nomination hearing is already

50
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:55,035
problematic, but turns out all we had to do
to see how racist you are was just wait.

51
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:58,438
Since your appointment to Attorney General
and part-time White House lawn gnome,

52
00:02:58,438 --> 00:03:02,474
you’ve tried everything in your goddamn
power, which is a lot of power, to dismantle

53
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:06,110
the progress we have made thus far
in civil rights. Your first act as

54
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,113
Attorney General was to reinstate taxpayer
funded corporate-owned prisons in

55
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:13,182
the US, even though many studies
show their lack of efficiency

56
00:03:13,182 --> 00:03:18,153
and poor safety standards. Oh and also,
it’s inherently unethical and immoral

57
00:03:18,153 --> 00:03:21,688
to make money off of incarcerating
people. But that controversial reversal

58
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:25,491
was probably to prep for the inevitable
increase in the number of incarcerated

59
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:28,827
since you then restarted
the failed war on drugs.

60
00:03:28,827 --> 00:03:30,061
That’s-That’s pretty cool too.

61
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:33,264
You’re also advocating for letting
lawbreaking police off the hook,

62
00:03:33,264 --> 00:03:36,599
while Trump simultaneously
promotes police violence.

63
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,536
“Like when you guys put somebody in
the car, and you’re protecting their head,

64
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:45,805
"you know? The way you put their hand. 
Like, don’t hit their head, and they’ve just

65
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:49,742
"killed somebody. Don’t hit their head.
I said you can take the hand away, okay?”

66
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:53,478
This is fucking insane. Guilty until
proven innocent, right? And you’ve

67
00:03:53,478 --> 00:03:56,513
even made it harder for defendants
to prove their innocence because

68
00:03:56,513 --> 00:03:59,882
you’ve cut back on forensic science, 
which has proven invaluable in

69
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:02,285
reversing wrongful convictions.
But we’re the one’s who are

70
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:05,587
being divisive, of course. These
are the reasons why we need

71
00:04:05,587 --> 00:04:09,857
a leveled playing field. Look, let's
remember what affirmative action is.

72
00:04:09,857 --> 00:04:13,659
It’s a policy favoring those who
tend to suffer from discrimination.

73
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:17,161
So it isn’t a bias that favors blacks,
Mexicans, women or even members

74
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:21,130
of the LGBT population. It just happens
that those are the communities that have

75
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,401
historically been discriminated against
in all aspects of life, including education.

76
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:28,436
If white people were the marginalized
group, they would be the beneficiaries

77
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:31,638
of affirmative action. The system 
isn’t perfect, but that doesn’t mean

78
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:36,008
it hasn’t helped. To equate affirmative
action with clear cut racial discrimination

79
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:40,312
is not only categorically false- it's
also an effort to deny the repressive,

80
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:44,481
and often violent history of oppression
African-Americans have historically faced-

81
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:46,182
and continue to face today.

82
00:04:46,182 --> 00:04:49,185
I’m Hasan Piker, please share this video
with your friends, if you think marginalized

83
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:51,954
communities deserve a level playing
field. Please don’t forget to follow me

84
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:54,856
on Instagram @hasandpiker and
on Twitter @hasanthehun.

85
00:04:54,856 --> 00:00:00,000
And this has been the breakdown.
