in a groundbreaking revelation published by The Jerusalem Post newspaper on Tuesday it ran with the headline that the Israeli Defense Forces confirms that Israel provided light weapons to Syrian rebels the article was immediately taken down but not before it was picked up elsewhere on the net the deleted article outlines hi Israel has been providing Syrian rebel groups with money and arms while the IDF maintains that it was not intervening in Syria's Civil War on Monday it confirmed that as part of Operation good neighbor Israel had been regularly supplying Syrian rebels near its border with light weapons and ammunition in order to defend themselves from attacks and a substantial amount of cash to buy additional arms operation good neighbor was officially presented as the IDF's effort to provide aid in Syria but according to The Jerusalem Post article its real goal was to keep his fellow fighters and Iranian soldiers away from Israel's borders and its guys Israel reportedly provided aid to no fewer than 7 Syrian rebel groups included among them Fersen al Doolin with a 400 strong fighting force who received some $5,000 as a monthly stipend reports have been circulating for a while that Israel supports so in rebel boots but this is the first time that those reports have been attributed to the IDF or at least they could have been if the article was not dropped we contacted the IDF but they refused to comment but a spokesperson for the Syrian rebel group previously confirmed Israel support to the Wall Street Journal Israel stood by our side in a heroic way we wouldn't have survived without Israel's assistance however the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has firmly rejected these reports he says that Israel's assistance has been purely humanitarian we do not interfere in this terribly bloody conflict we do however provide humanitarian aid to young boys and girls it is expensive but we will continue to invest of course the Syrian government has been accusing Israel of providing weapons to the rebels for some time back in May Syrian state reported that the militants have handed over hundreds of Israeli made weapons Israel firmly denies these reports but similar findings have appeared elsewhere and on numerous occasions policy ax RT Jerusalem as he reached out to the Jerusalem Post they told us they were forced to remove the article by the Army's military censor citing security reasons we spoke to investigative journalist Martin Hamel who says that the Israeli media is subject to strict censorship it probably appeared in such a major media outlet because it has some truth it's not such a secret there's been it's been understood that this has been going on to some degree for quite a while it could be that that the Israeli censor there's a censorship here with certain and when it comes to certain issues of security Israel has certain laws here about releasing secrets releasing information that affects security and there is a censorship rule here which is strictly adhered to especially by the Israeli press I guess they decide to go up with it without checking if it's violating some sort of security laws and then the censorship came along and said take it away but and you know and we all know once it's out there in our internet world it's always out there you
