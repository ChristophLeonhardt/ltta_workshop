this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i probably should but i</font>

28
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,320
figured i was correct in assuming a lot

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,890
so and work it into your scalp really

32
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,780
like rub it in there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like so</font>

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,570
and

34
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,860
and it should look a little something

35
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,659
like that when you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> done there you go</font>

36
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:49,550
and then you're going to try to retwist

37
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,570
your twist because you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

38
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,360
out if<font color="#CCCCCC"> your 4b 4c like me then you're</font>

39
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,710

stuff and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the water help</font>

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,270
