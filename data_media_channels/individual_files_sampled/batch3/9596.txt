♪ ♪ IMPRACTICAL. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PARDONING HIMSELF WOULD JUST BE UNTHINKABLE. AND IT WOULD LEAD TO PROBABLY AN IMMEDIATE IMPEACHMENT. HOUSE, SENATE WILL BE UNDER TREMENDOUS PRESSURE. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NO NEED TO DO THAT. HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG. THANKFULLY THE PRESIDENT HASN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG AND WOULDN'T HAVE NEED FOR A PARDON. Shannon: MATT SCHLAPP, WITH "THE HILL." A.B. STODDARD, GUY BENSON. WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU. THE PRESIDENT HAS TWEETED A LOT, AS HE ALWAYS DOES. HE SAYS LISTEN I'VE BEEN TOLD BY NUMEROUS LEGAL SCHOLARS I HAVE THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO PARDON MYSELF BUT WHY WOULD I DO THAT WHEN I HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG? THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT THEY CALLED A POLITICAL QUESTION. YOU ARE THE LAWYER. I AM NOT. THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD BE IN A PLACE WHERE THE PRESIDENT WOULD BE PARDONING HIMSELF, MAYBE IT GOES TO THE NATION'S HIGHEST COURT, I THINK WITH THE PRESIDENT IS REALLY TRYING TO SAY IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS WHOLE CONTROVERSY, INCLUDING SPYING ON THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, SPYING ON MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSING CAMPAIGN. LOTS OF QUESTIONS. HE IS SAYING I'M GOING TO FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE. YOU ARE DOING THINGS I VIEW EXTRA CONSTITUTIONAL, INCLUDING A SPECIAL COUNSEL ACTING MORE LIKE I SAID AND CONFIRMED ACTOR. HE SAYS I'M GOING TO FIGHT IT. Shannon: I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT ED MARKEY HAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS. HERE'S HIS TAKE. IT'S NOT A RULE OF TRUMP. IT'S A RULE OF LAW THAT WE LIVE UNDER THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. EVEN IN 1974, RICHARD NIXON'S JUSTICE DEPARTMENT MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT NIXON COULD NOT PARDON HIMSELF. THE SAME THING IS TRUE HERE. Shannon: HE IS REFERRING TO A MEMO WRITTEN BY ACTING ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS SET UNDER THE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE THAT NO ONE CAN BE A JUDGE IN HIS OWN CASE, THE PRESIDENT CANNOT PARDON HIMSELF. 1974. NIXON HOPED IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE, BUT IT WASN'T. THIS IS, REMEMBER WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF SPIN WIRE, A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN THAT RUDY GIULIANI IS WAGING IN THE PRESS ON BEHALF OF DONALD TRUMP AT HIS REQUEST TO SPIN THINGS A CERTAIN WAY SO AS TO FORM THE OPINIONS AMONG TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND OTHERS AND CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS WERE SUPINE AND COMPLETELY ACQUIESCENT AT THIS POINT. Shannon: THEY DISAGREE ON SOME OF THESE POINTS. I DON'T HEAR ANYONE TODAY FIGHTING THAT PARDON THING. TED CRUZ WENT SILENT FOR 18 SECONDS WHEN ASKED IF IT WAS CONSTITUTIONAL FOR THE PRESIDENT TO FIRE HIMSELF. HE BOASTED, TO PARDON HIMSELF. I'M SORRY. THEY DO NOT PUSH BACK. THEY SAID IF THAT WAS MY LAWYER, I WOULD GET A NEW ONE. Shannon: SOUNDS LIKE A PUSH BACK. WE ARE TAKING AN OATH TO THE CONSTITUTION OR NOT THE MAN. HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO DO THIS. THEY ARE NEARLY DICTATORIAL POWERS HE IS DESCRIBING IN THE 20 PAGE MEMO AND THEN THE TWEETS THIS MORNING. IT'S OUT OF LINE. NO ONE PUSHED BACK THAT HARD. THEY CALLED IT A DISTRACTION. BOB CORKER WONDERED WHY HE TALKS THIS WAY. TAKES AWAY THE SUBJECTS OF THE DAY. SHANNON, LET'S GET BACK TO THE FACT THAT THE TRUMP TEAM COMPLETELY LIED ABOUT THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING, DESCRIPTION THAT THE PRESIDENT GAVE MONEY DICTATED A FULL STATEMENT. THEY KNOW BOB MUELLER HAS NOT. THEY KNOW THAT THE MAN ON THE LEGAL TEAM LEFT BECAUSE HE BELIEVED A COVER-UP WAS IN THE HATCHING. Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. LET'S BREAK IT DOWN. THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS RUDY GIULIANI SAID ABOUT WHY HE DOESN'T WANT THE PRESIDENT TO TESTIFY BECAUSE HE SAID IF YOU REMEMBER THINGS DIFFERENTLY, IF THE ACCOUNTS CHANGE, IT CREATES A LOT OF PROBLEMS EVEN IF THERE IS INNOCENT EXPLANATION FOR EVERYTHING ABOUT WHO DICTATED THE LETTER, WHAT INPUT THE PRESIDENT HAD. SEEMS THE STORY IS CHANGE. GIULIANI SAID NO. BUT THIS IS WHY I DON'T WANT HIM INTERVIEWING THE PRESIDENT. IT HURTS THEIR CREDIBILITY, NO QUESTION. AS I LOOK BACK AND I LOOK AT THESE CLIPS AND I WATCH THEM FROM THE SUNDAY SHOWS, I AM THINKING WHAT ON EARTH ARE WE DOING HERE. WHY ARE WE LISTENING TO THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM SPECULATE IN REAL TIME ABOUT WHETHER HE MIGHT DO SOMETHING THAT THEY HASTEN TO ADD HE WILL NEVER HAVE TO DO IT. TO ME IT'S AN OBVIOUS, IT'S A CRAZY HYPOTHETICAL. HE WOULD NEVER COME TO THAT. NEXT QUESTION, NO COMMENT. INSTEAD, TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN AND SAYS YOU BET I CAN DO IT WHICH IS WHY WE ALSO DO HERE DEBATING THE FINER POINTS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT COULD HYPOTHETICALLY GET TO THAT POINT. Shannon: AGAIN, HE SAYS THERE'S NO NEED FOR IT. HE WANTS TO BE ON THE RECORD SAYING I BELIEVE BECAUSE OF WHAT LEGAL SCHOLARS HAVE TOLD ME I WOULD BE RIGHT TO DO THIS. THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT ARE THE PRESIDENT LIMITS OF THE PARDON POWER BUT THERE'S ALSO A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER A PRESIDENT CAN BE INDICTED. I THINK WHAT THE FOUNDERS AND THE WRITERS OF THE CONSTITUTION ENVISIONED IS THAT A POLITICIAN THE HEAD OF OUR GOVERNMENT, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE THESE QUESTIONS IS THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS THROUGH THE HOUSE WITH CONVICTION AND THE SENATE. THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE PRESIDENT COULD BE INDICTED, IT HINGES ON THIS QUESTION OF PARDONS AND HINGES ON THE QUESTION, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, WE HAVE BOB MUELLER ACTING MUCH MORE LIKE A SENATE-CONFIRMED OFFICER OF THE CONSTITUTION AND NOT LIKE SOMEBODY WHO WAS PICKED TO DO A DISCRETE TASK. THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION. IS BOB MUELLER BEING MANAGED? IS HE ABLE TO PULL PEOPLE ON HIS TEAM AT HIS DISCRETION? IF THAT'S THE CASE, HE SHOULD BE CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE. IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS. DICTATORIAL WHICH YOU KNOW IS GOING TO UPSET PEOPLE. I SAID NEARLY DICTATORIAL. Shannon: IF THERE ARE ENOUGH PEOPLE CONVINCE THIS PERSON IS OUT OF LINE WITH HER HAS COMMITTED A CRIME OR NOT OR PARDON HIMSELF OR NOT, THEY STILL HAVE A MEANS. HE IS NOT LIMITLESS IN HIS POWER. THERE STILL A WAY TO REIN HIM IN IF THE LAWMAKERS ARE CONVINCED. SPEAK UP BETWEEN THE MEMO AND HIS TWEETS COME HE'S BASICALLY SAYING I CAN TERMINATE THIS AT ANY TIME. I CAN'T BE INDICTED. I CAN PARDON MYSELF. HE USED THE WORDS "ABSOLUTE RIGHT." HE'S PRESENTING HIMSELF AS ABOVE THE INVESTIGATION LET ALONE THE LAWS. THEY ARE PREPARING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS NOW, RUDY GIULIANI IS PREPARING A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN IN ORDER TO, BASICALLY SAYING HE CAN'T BE INDICTED, HE CAN ONLY BE IMPEACHED. WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH, THE REASON I RAISED A TRUMP TOWER MEETING IN THE STATEMENT ABOUT IT IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT MUELLER PERCEIVES IT TO BE AN OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. IS LIKELY TO BE PRESENTED THAT WAY. THE LETTER FROM JANUARY WITH THOSE ASSERTIONS IS DESIGNED TO SAY BUT YOU CAN'T EVEN REALLY ASSESS IT AS OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE BECAUSE HE CAN'T OBSTRUCT THE LAW. SO HE IS SAYING TO CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS YOU CAN'T EVEN IMPEACH HIM FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. Shannon: IT'S NOT LIKE YESTERDAY THAT PEOPLE DECIDED THERE HAD TO BE A P.R. COMPONENT OF THE POLITICAL FIGHTS THEY ARE WAGING HERE. THAT IS AS OLD AS TIME. CORRECT. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE ARE ALL SORT OF ANALYZING AND GRANULAR DETAIL THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER, THE 20 PAGE LETTER THAT WENT OUT IN JANUARY, ALMOST THE ENTIRE LEGAL TEAM IS GONE NOW. YOU COULD ARGUE THAT SOME OF THE ASSERTIONS THEY MADE IN THERE, THEY ARE OBSOLETE WHICH IS WHY I AM BAFFLED WHY RUDY AND OTHERS WOULD EVEN INDULGE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT SELF PARDONS. THAT'S A DISTRACTION RIGHT NOW. IT'S GETTING WAY AHEAD OF ANYTHING, AND YET THEY SORT OF THREW THAT CHUM IN THE WATER COME OR AT LEAST RESPONDED TO THE BAIT FROM THE PRESS. MEN TRUMP DOUBLE DOWN. I DON'T THINK THAT DOES HIM MUCH OF A SERVICE. Shannon: WE WILL SEE. THERE IS AN INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT DUE OUT. WE HAVE THE MUELLER
