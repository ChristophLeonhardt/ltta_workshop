IMPACTFUL, PASSIONATE
SPEECHES EVER IN THAT
COMMITTEE.
TOM FITTON WAS IN THE ROOM
AT THE TIME.
HE WAS THE PRESIDENT OF
JUDICIAL WATCH.
TOM, WE DIDN'T HEAR ANY NEW
DETAILS, REALLY.
NO NEW EVIDENCE.
SO WHERE ARE WE THIS
MORNING?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, DESPITE
THIS BIG CIRCUS OF A
HEARING, IT DIDN'T ADVANCE
THE BALL IN TERMS OF
PROVIDING OH MY GOSH, HE
CERTAINLY DID IT OR ANYTHING
THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU
CAN'T TRUST ANYTHING THIS
WOMAN SAID, YOU KNOW, OTHER
THAN THE FACT SHE HAD NO
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE AND
NO ONE SUPPORTED HER.
OF COURSE WE KNEW THAT THE
DAY BEFORE THE HEARING AND
WE DIDN'T NEED A HEARING TO
NOW KNOW WHAT WE KNOW TODAY
WHICH IS WHY HIS CASE OR HIS
CONFIRMATION IS GOING TO GO
TO A VOTE LATER TODAY
BECAUSE NOTHING NEW HAPPENED
YESTERDAY OTHER THAN THE
CIRCUS.
AND I'M GLAD THE REPUBLICANS
ARE SHUTTING THE CIRCUS
DOWN.
I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE
MOVED TO THE COMMITTEE VOTE
IF THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY
HAD THE VOTES TO MOVE HIM
OUT OF COMMITTEE AND
ULTIMATELY TO CONFIRMATION.
SO, DESPITE THE TORTURE AND
IT WAS TORTURE AND IT WAS
REALLY UNETHICAL WHAT THE
SENATE DEMOCRATS PUT HIM
THROUGH IN LEAGUE WITH HEIR
LEFTIST ALLIES IT, LOOKS
LIKE JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL BE
THE NEXT SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE BY THE MIDDLE OF
NEXT WEEK.
AINSLEY: TOM, YOU WERE IN
THE ROOM, WE CAN SIT HERE ON
THE COUCH AND TALK ABOUT
THIS, BUT WE WEREN'T
ACTUALLY IN THE ROOM.
WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO BE IN
THE ROOM WHEN LINDSEY GRAHAM
MADE THOSE STATEMENTS?
>> OH, IT WAS HIGH DRAMA.
I COULD SEE SENATOR GRAHAM
EVEN BEFORE THAT WAS
REACTING QUITE STRONGLY.
YOU ARE SITTING THERE AND
CAN YOU SEE HIM ALMOST
POPPING OUT OF HIS CHAIR IN
RESPONSE TO SOME OF WHAT WAS
GOING ON.
AND GOING BACK TO THE
BEGINNING OF THE HEARING
BEFORE DR. FORD TESTIFIED,
GUYS THAT TENSION IN THAT
ROOM WAS INCREDIBLE.
AND YOU COULD CUT IT WITH A
KNIFE.
AND EVERYONE WAS PAYING VERY
CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT SHE
SAID.
AND THEN LATER IN THE DAY
JUDGE KAVANAUGH CAME IN, AND
DEFENDED HIMSELF QUITE ABLY
AND WENT AT THE HEARING, THE
SENATORS THERE FROM THE
DEMOCRATIC SIDE QUITE
DIRECTLY.
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY GET
THAT FROM THE CAMERAS, THEY
WERE HELD TO ACCOUNT.
I HAVE TO SAY, I THOUGHT THE
DEMOCRATS HAD THE ADVANTAGE,
EVEN THROUGH JUDGE
KAVANAUGH'S OPENING
TESTIMONY.
IT WAS DRAMATIC BUT THE
DEMOCRATS LOST WHEN THEY
BEGAN OPENING THEIR MOUTHS
QUESTIONING HIM BECAUSE THE
VALE WAS LIFTED.
YOU COULD SEE THEY WERE
DISHONEST.
STEVE: FBI, FBI, FBI.
>> ONE OF THE WORST THINGS
IS HAVING HIM I FORGET WHO
WAS QUESTIONING HIM ABOUT
THE YEARBOOK.
GIANTS POSTERS OF THE
YEARBOOK AND YOU SAW THE
ABSURDITY.
BRIAN: SENATOR WHITEHOUSE.
>> ALL THE CREDIBILITY THEY
THOUGHT THEY HAD JUST WENT
OUT THE DOOR WHEN YOU HAVE
THIS POOR MAN'S YEARBOOK
BEING RAISED AS IF IT WAS A
PIECE OF EVIDENCE AGAINST
HIM.
IT WAS ABSURD.
BRIAN: TOM, THE WHOLE IDEA
IS THIS DO YOU BELIEVE TO
BELIEVE FORD OR KAVANAUGH'S
AUTHENTICITY.
IF FORD WANTED TO KEEP
ANONYMITY THAT WAS THROWN IN
THE STREET AGAINST HER WILL
IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE WHAT WE
HEAR.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN HAD IT,
HELD IT AND SUDDENLY OUT
THERE.
WHY WAS IT OUT THERE AND WHY
WAS HER NAME RELEASED?
SHE COULD HAVE BEEN HONEST
AND GOTTEN TO THE BOTTOM OF
THIS.
ONE ON ONE THEY COULD HAVE
GOTTEN ALLEGATIONS OUT AND
THEY DIDN'T DO IT.
HERE IS SENATOR DIANNE
FEINSTEIN DENYING THAT SHE
LEAKED THE LETTER.
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, LET ME BE
CLEAR, DID I NOT HIDE
DR. FORD'S ALLEGATIONS.
I DID NOT LEAK HER STORY,
SHE ASKED ME TO HOLD IT
CONFIDENTIAL, AND I KEPT IT
CONFIDENTIAL AS SHE ASKED.
SHE APPARENTLY WAS STALKED
BY THE PRESS, FELT THAT WHAT
HAPPENED, SHE WAS FORCED TO
COME FORWARD, AND HER
GREATEST FEAR WERE
REALIZED -- WAS REALIZED.
SHE HAS BEEN HARASSED.
SHE HAS HAD DEATH THREATS
AND SHE HAS HAD TO FLEE HER
HOME.
BRIAN: WHY WAS SHE STALKED
BY THE PRESS?
BECAUSE HER NAME LEAKED OUT.
>> THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIC
SIDE OF THE AISLE THERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK CAME
OUT YESTERDAY WAS SENATOR
FEINSTEIN'S CORRUPT
OPERATION WHERE THEY
WITHHELD THE FACT THAT THEY
KNEW ABOUT THESE ALLEGATIONS
WHILE THEY WERE QUESTIONING
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, SO THEY
KNEW THEY HAD THIS HERE.
THEY COULD HAVE ASKED THE
FBI TO DO A QUICK INTERVIEW
WEEKS AGO.
AND, ON TOP OF THAT
FEINSTEIN'S STAFF IS
RECOMMENDING HER LAWYERS
FURTHER UNDERMINING HER
CREDIBILITY TO THE DETRIMENT
OF THE ACCUSER.
SINCE THE CORRUPTION OF THE
DEMOCRATIC SIDE HERE WAS
EXPOSE YOU HAD, AND, YOU
KNOW, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER
THEY ARE ALSO PUSHING OUT
FALSE ALLEGATIONS THAT CAME
OUT SUBSEQUENTLY AGAINST
JUDGE KAVANAUGH THAT WERE
ABSURD ON THEIR FACE AND I'M
NOT GOING TO REPEAT THEM
BECAUSE THEY DON'T DESERVE
REPETITION.
THIS MAN HAS HAD HIS
REPUTATION DRAGGED THROUGH
THE MUD ENOUGH.
AGAIN, THE DEMOCRATS LOST
YESTERDAY, THANKFULLY, NOT
BECAUSE ANYONE OPPOSES THEM
IN A PARTISAN WAY, IT'S
BECAUSE THIS PROCESS WOULD
HAVE RUINED THE SENATE IF IT
WAS ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH
THE WAY THEY WANTED TO GO
THROUGH, WHICH IS TO RAISE
ALLEGATIONS WITHOUT
EVIDENCE.
THIS WOMAN THEY BELIEVE WHAT
SHE SAYS THEY BELIEVE.
YOU CAN BELIEVE HER AND HAVE
SYMPATHY FOR HER.
IT ISN'T ENOUGH TO DERAIL
THIS MAN'S NOMINATION,
DESTROY HIS REPUTATION.
THIS IS WHY IT SHOULD HAVE
BEEN HELD PRIVATELY.
YOU COULD HAVE EVALUATED HER
AND SAID YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE APPRECIATE YOU THINK THAT
HAPPENED 35 YEARS AGO.
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE
TO DERAIL THIS NOMINATION.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO TORTURE
YOU BY GOING THROUGH PUBLIC
RECITATION AND HIM.
BOTH WERE ABUSED.
THE SENATE OWES JUDGE
KAVANAUGH AN APOLOGY.
THE BEST APOLOGY WOULD BE TO
CONFIRM HIM AS QUICKLY AS
POSSIBLE THOUGH.
