00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">entry there has been a lot of talk about</font>

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">the eagle ford shale and the Marcellus</font>

3
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,580
Shale what are they what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do they mean</font>

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">for your company's sure it fundamentally</font>

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,020
in the oil and gas business it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll look</font>

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,900
at it the quest for resources is the

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,970
quest for inventory what companies want

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,039
is something that provides years of

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,199
visibility which which ultimately kind

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,930
of gets down to to the consumer you know

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,940
consumer be<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the heat is home for for</font>

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,829
multiple years in the future and shale

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,620
gas because of its its its its relative

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,660
youth you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the oil and gas mix</font>

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,450
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's very young in terms of our</font>

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,239
producing it and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these different</font>

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,489
plays<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ego for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Haynesville the</font>

18
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:51,989
bach and the Marcellus they're all plays

19
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:53,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a scattered throughout</font>

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,500
North America that industry has been

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,210
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of provide that</font>

22
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,010
inventory for the future how young is

23
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,940
this production well the kind of shale

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,349
play that started them all is the

25
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,180
Barnett Shale and that's really outside

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">in under Fort Worth Texas people had</font>

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,490
been producing that excuse me since the

28
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,970
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think 1990s but in terms of really</font>

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,470
ramping up the volume of production<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

30
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,350
only happened in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last decade and if</font>

31
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,570
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the Marcellus was also a</font>

32
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,390
formation I was produced in the 80s the

33
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,090
Appalachians worse yeah it's outside its

34
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,520
parts of Pennsylvania its parts of New

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,520
York parts of West Virginia and I mean

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">folks of course the oil business started</font>

37
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,619
in Pennsylvania 150 years ago so I you

38
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,180
know folks are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

39
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,159
same rocks you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the same basins you</font>

40
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,200
know that analogy is where's the best

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,030
place to find oil and gas is where

42
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,100
you've already found oil and gas so it's

43
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">just by using new technology and kind of</font>

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,939
lower costs are trying to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to</font>

45
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,490
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that gas to market now places like</font>

46
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,780
the Marcels are very interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

47
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,299
they are so close to the major markets

48
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,689
know if you were to play shale from a

49
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,549
market perspective who's best positioned

50
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,290
in your group to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of capitalize on</font>

51
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,020
those reserves well to stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

52
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,639
theme of the upgrades yesterday I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,989
comment on resources which is the

54
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">largest player in the Bakken oil shale</font>

55
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,460
and according to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> USGS we're talking</font>

56
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,410
about three to five billion barrels of

57
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">recoverable oil possible or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in place and</font>

58
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,920
continental has over 650,000 net acres

59
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,470
prospective for that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you figure it</font>

60
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,110
yep that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a thousand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

61
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">2000 wells you know possibility being</font>

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,130
drilled on that play not including

63
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,950
downspacing so now with them running 15

64
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,810
rigs this year drilling somewhere on the

65
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,060
order of a hundred wells you know that

66
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,470
gives you many many<font color="#CCCCCC"> years of additional</font>

67
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,750
inventory to provide oil to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US</font>

68
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,580
market now you had mentioned this is in

69
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,560
proximity as close to New York City<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,370
I know they're pretty big opponents of

71
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,960
exploring this area do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think that</font>

72
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,010
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get hung up in</font>

73
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,010
regulation I mean it's the government

74
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,600
going to care about the water I mean

75
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">there there's certainly you know there's</font>

76
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,200
no reason to do anything that that's

77
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,300
unsafe and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think anybody</font>

78
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chesapeake I said that they're not going</font>

79
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go into that area yeah that sounds</font>

80
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,100
sounds correct i but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm but i'm not</font>

81
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">positive in general the oil and gas in</font>

82
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,020
if he doesn't want want to hurt anybody

83
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,340
and damage their reputation it etc so

84
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,470
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone is trying to find what</font>

85
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,820
the best solution is but you know

86
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,440
fundamentally if we don't have natural

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,630
gas fracturing we probably don't have

88
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,720
natural gas supplies as you know the

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">vast majority of wells are have to be</font>

90
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,140
naturally fractured it's just up the

91
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,670
industry and government you know and

92
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,960
citizens kind of work together to find

93
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most kind of sensible solution great</font>

94
00:03:39,690 --> 00:00:00,000
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andrew sure</font>
