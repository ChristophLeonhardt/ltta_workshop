1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,969
ABOUT CRUMBS, PER AGENT OR

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:03,870
OBSESSION WITH RUSSIA.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,539
DON'T MISS THAT.

4
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:11,310
BUT FIRST, THE REAL SUMMIT

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,111
EMBARRASSMENT.

6
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:13,713
MEDIA REACTION TO

7
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:14,914
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CANCELING THE

8
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:15,648
NORTH KOREAN SUMMIT MIRRORED THE

9
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,316
REACTION TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF

10
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:19,719
THE SUMMIT.

11
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,120
IT WAS SCORN AND DERISION.

12
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,522
TO THEM, A LOSS FOR THE

13
00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:24,757
PRESIDENT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN

14
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:27,560
A SUCCESS FOR AMERICA, OR EVEN

15
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,762
FOR WORLD PEACE.

16
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:31,764
BACK ON MARCH 8TH, WHEN

17
00:00:31,764 --> 00:00:33,165
PRESIDENT TRUMP FIRST DELIVERED

18
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:35,368
NEWS OF THE SUMMIT, THE LEFT AND

19
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,569
THE MEDIA WERE IN SHOCK.

20
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,971
HOW COULD TRUMP OF ALL PEOPLE

21
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:41,774
SUDDENLY HAVE A SHOT AT FORGING

22
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:43,042
PEACE WITH THIS COMMUNIST

23
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,010
DICTATORSHIP?

24
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,412
MAYBE EVEN FORCE IT TO THE

25
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:49,348
NUCLEAR RISE, WHEREAS ARE     AL

26
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:49,382
NUCLEAR RISE, WHEREAS ARE     AT

27
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:49,615
NUCLEAR RISE, WHEREAS ARE     AE

28
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:51,817
OTHER PRESIDENTS HAD FAILED.

29
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:55,021
AFTERWARDS WITH LITTLE ROCKET

30
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,691
MAN, THE SUDDEN PROSPECT OF

31
00:00:58,691 --> 00:00:59,425
PEACE WAS FRANKLY JUST MORE THAN

32
00:00:59,425 --> 00:00:59,926
THEY COULD STAND.

33
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:03,796
AND SOMEHOW THEY SAID IT WAS

34
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:05,831
DANGEROUS.

35
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:08,267
>> OUR DEPARTMENT, THE CLOSEST

36
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:10,036
ALLIES, I'M SURE NOBODY ON THE

37
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,237
HILL KNEW ABOUT THIS.

38
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,838
DONALD TRUMP JUST DECIDED THIS

39
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:15,241
WAS THE REALITY TV SHOW

40
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:15,942
PRESIDENT TO CHANGE THE

41
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:22,114
HEADLINES.

42
00:01:22,114 --> 00:01:25,718
AND, AND THAT HAS BEEN THE DREAM

43
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,420
OF NORTH KOREAN LEADERS FOR

44
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,689
DECADES NOW THAT THEY WOULD

45
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:34,060
ADVANCED THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAMS

46
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,829
AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE

47
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:37,596
ADMINISTRATION INTENDED TO BE BE

48
00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:43,436
THAT KIND OF A GIFT.

49
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,837
AND DONALD TRUMP AGREED,

50
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:46,072
KIM JONG UN IS LIKE QUOTE

51
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,340
RICHARD NIXON GOING TO CHINA,

52
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,045
BUT IF NIXON WERE A MORON."

53
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:54,046
WELL, SPEAKING OF MORONS COME UP

54
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:55,648
THIS CROWD AND THE PROSPECT OF A

55
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,850
SUMMIT TO THEM WAS NOT ONLY

56
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,051
DANGEROUS, BUT THE PRESIDENT WAS

57
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:01,253
A FOOL FOR ENGAGING THE

58
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:02,421
NORTH KOREANS AT ALL.

59
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:04,457
NOW THEY ARE SHIFTING NARRATIVES

60
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:04,757
AGAIN.

61
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:07,626
THE SAME CHAIN OF FOOLS IS

62
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:10,628
SAYING THE CANCELLATION IS

63
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:12,631
REALLY PERILOUS ITSELF AND

64
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:14,633
TRUMPS IMPETUOUS DIPLOMACY AND

65
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:16,268
INEXPERIENCE OF COURSE ARE AT

66
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:16,569
FAULT.

67
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,137
THE HEADLINE ON

68
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:18,971
"THE WASHINGTON POST" SCREAMED,

69
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:21,841
TRUMP IMPULSIVELY BLOWS UP THE

70
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:22,475
NORTH KOREAN SUMMIT.

71
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,642
THE EDITORIAL BOARD BLAMES TRUMP

72
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:26,879
FOR WHAT IT CALLED A HASTY

73
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,247
STRATEGY OF IMPROVISATION THAT

74
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:28,981
CHARACTERIZED HANDLING OF THE

75
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:32,651
DIPLOMATIC OPENING ALL ALONE.

76
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:32,952
ALONG.

77
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:37,690
THE POSTER BOARD, HAS SUCH CHAOS

78
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,459
AFFECTED THE MATTER OF SUCH

79
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:41,293
GRAVITY.

80
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:43,029
AND HERE IS HOW THE CABLE NEWS

81
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:43,562
NETWORK'S REACTIVE.

82
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:45,431
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS RAISED

83
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,768
EXPECTATIONS TO THE POINT WHERE,

84
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:52,071
I'M IN CHARGE HERE.

85
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,239
IT WAS A LITTLE UNREALISTIC.

86
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,074
SPEAK OUT THE ART OF DIPLOMACY

87
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,308
IS HARDER THAN THE ART OF THE

88
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:56,842
DEAL.

89
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:58,878
>> DOES THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE

90
00:02:58,878 --> 00:02:59,879
A LONG-TERM GAME PLAN HERE?

91
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,315
>> I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

92
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:03,816
SECRETLY RELIEVED.

93
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,985
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S A SECRET,

94
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,353
I THINK THERE'S LOTS OF RELIEF.

95
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,921
>> LET'S GO TO PETER ALEXANDER

96
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:12,258
WHO IS LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

97
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:16,262
PETER, THIS IS A HUGE A WHILE

98
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:16,595
FOR US.

99
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:20,299
>> Laura: DID YOU CATCH THAT?

100
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:22,635
AT LEAST SHE'S IMPLICITLY SAYING

101
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:23,736
THAT MEDIA DID NOT INSIST ON

102
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,172
REPORTING FOR TRUMP BUT TO REVEL

103
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,441
IN HIS MISS PERCEIVED MISSTEPS.

104
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,442
THESE PEOPLE HAVEN'T BEEN THIS

105
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,910
HAPPY SINCE THEY THOUGHT OPRAH

106
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,245
WOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT.

107
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:35,347
THEY ARE THRILLED TODAY.

108
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:37,083
WELL, TRUMPED         TRUMP IS I

109
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:37,116
WELL, TRUMPED         TRUMP IS F

110
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:37,149
WELL, TRUMPED         TRUMP IS H

111
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:37,183
WELL, TRUMPED         TRUMP IS

112
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:37,216
WELL, TRUMPED         TRUMP IS O

113
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:37,616
WELL, TRUMPED         TRUMP IS S

114
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:37,650
WELL, TRUMPED         TRUMP IS A

115
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:37,817
WELL, TRUMPED         TRUMP IS D

116
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:37,850
WELL, TRUMPED         TRUMP IS I

117
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,150
WELL, TRUMPED         TRUMP IS F

118
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,251
HE DOESN'T.

119
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:41,487
POPE MIGHT I OFFER ANOTHER

120
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,655
POSSIBILITY HERE?

121
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,056
TRUMP'S RETREAT FROM THE SUMMIT

122
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:45,658
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GRAND

123
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,060
NEGOTIATING TACTIC, NOT AN

124
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,727
ADMISSION OF FAILURE AT ALL.

125
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:51,097
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A WAY OF

126
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:51,797
TESTING KIM'S SERIOUSNESS AND

127
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:54,066
SQUEEZING MAY BE A FEW MORE

128
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,468
CONCESSIONS FROM HIM.

129
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,936
THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY GOTTEN

130
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,704
LITTLE ROCKET MAN TO HAND OVER

131
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:00,506
AMERICAN HOSTAGES AND THEY HAVE

132
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,308
ALLEGEDLY DETONATED THAT NUCLEAR

133
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,709
TESTING FACILITY, ALTHOUGH THAT

134
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,478
HE NOT BE AS BIG OF A STORY AS

135
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,446
WE HAD HOPED.

136
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:09,648
THE AP IS REPORTING THAT THE

137
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:11,250
NORTH ALLOWED THE NATIONAL

138
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:11,884
INSPECTORS TO MONITOR THE

139
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,619
SUPPOSED IMPLOSION.

140
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:15,754
BUT THIS WAS PART OF THE REASON

141
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:17,656
WHY TRUMP BACKED AWAY FROM THE

142
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:18,656
SUMMIT TABLE.

143
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:20,059
THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR HAD

144
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,895
ALSO BRISTLED AT THE TALK OF

145
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,463
DENUCLEARIZING HIS COUNTRY AND

146
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:26,265
THAT IS NONNEGOTIABLE FOR TRUMP.

147
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:27,500
WE ALSO LEARNED THAT

148
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,534
NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS NEVER

149
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,869
SHOWED UP FOR PRELIMINARY TALKS

150
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,837
IN SINGAPORE LAST WEEK, WHICH

151
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:34,640
WAS A SURPRISE.

152
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,842
BUT IF HE READ THE PRESIDENT'S

153
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:38,043
LETTER TODAY, HE CLEARLY LEFT

154
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:40,846
THE DOOR OPEN TO A PEACE DEAL

155
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:43,115
AND TOLD KIM, IF YOU CHANGE YOUR

156
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:45,417
MIND HAVING TO DO WITH THIS

157
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:46,152
IMPORTANT SUMMIT, PLEASE DON'T

158
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,254
HESITATE TO CALL ME OR WRITE,

159
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:48,888
LIKE A PEN PAL.

160
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,090
BUT BY PULLING THE PLUG ON THE

161
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,259
SUMMIT THE PRESIDENT MAY WELL

162
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,126
HAVE APPLIED THE NEEDED

163
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:56,262
PRESSURE, AND THAT TOUGH STANCE

164
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,397
ALONG WITH CONTINUED ECONOMIC

165
00:04:58,397 --> 00:04:59,431
SANCTIONS AND DIPLOMATIC

166
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:01,834
ISOLATION MAY ULTIMATELY

167
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,170
CONVINCE KIM JONG UN TO ACTUALLY

168
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,838
MAKE A SERIOUS DEAL.

169
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,474
THERE ARE NO NOW SIGNS THAT THE

170
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,209
TRUMP STRATEGY COULD BE WORKING.

171
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,077
NORTH KOREA'S VICE FOREIGN

172
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:13,078
MINISTER IN A STATEMENT TONIGHT

173
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:14,880
SAYS, OUR GOAL AND WILL TO DO

174
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,515
EVERYTHING FOR PEACE AND

175
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:18,817
STABILITY OF THE GRAN PENINSULA

176
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:20,486
AND MANKIND REMAINS UNCHANGED.

177
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,454
WE ARE ALWAYS WILLING TO GIVE

178
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:28,661
TIME AND OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE

179
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,295
WITH AN OPEN MIND.

180
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:33,065
THERE IS AN INTENTION TO SIT AND

181
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:34,667
RESOLVE ANY AND ALL ISSUES.

182
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,936
OF COURSE IT'S, THE

183
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,439
NORTH KOREANS ARE STILL RULING

184
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,340
OUT TOTAL DENUCLEARIZATION.

185
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:41,941
MY TAKE?

186
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,710
LET THE MEDIA CHAIR WITH THE
