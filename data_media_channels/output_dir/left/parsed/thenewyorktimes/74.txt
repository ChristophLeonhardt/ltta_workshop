Michael Cohen,
President Trump’s
former personal lawyer,
went from this:
“I’ll do anything to
protect Mr. Trump.”
“They say I’m
Mr. Trump’s pit bull.”
“I’ve stood by him,
shoulder to shoulder.”
To this: “Shock waves
after President Trump’s
former attorney
Michael Cohen ...”
“Michael Cohen, pleading guilty
and implicating the president ...”
“... possibly the worst day in
Donald Trump’s presidency
thus far.”
So why did one of Trump’s
most trusted advisers flip?
Cohen was known for being Trump’s
fixer and biggest defender.
“If there’s an issue that
relates to Mr. Trump
that is of concern to him,
it’s of course of 
concern to me.
And I will use my legal
skills within which
to protect Mr. Trump to
the best of my ability.”
In April, the F.B.I.
raided Cohen’s office
after he became a target
in special counsel Robert
Mueller’s investigation.
Trump was quick to come
to Cohen’s defense.
But once the investigation
zeroed in on Cohen,
the lawyer began
to change his tune.
“My wife, my daughter and my
son have my first loyalty
and always will.
I put family and
country first.”
In July, Cohen released
audio from a conversation
with Donald Trump
that he secretly recorded
two months before
the 2016 election.
The two appear to be
discussing payments
to a former Playboy
model who said
she had an affair
with Trump.
Here’s when things
between Trump and Cohen
began to publicly fall apart.
“I expected something
like this from Cohen,
he’s been lying all week.
I mean, for two —
he’s been lying for years.
There’s nobody that I know
that knows him
that hasn’t warned me that if
his back is up against the wall,
he will lie like crazy,
because he’s lied all his life.”
On Aug. 21, Cohen
pleaded guilty to violating
federal campaign
finance laws and said
President Trump directed him
to make payments to two women
during the 2016 campaign
to avoid a potential sex scandal.
Cohen’s lawyer
suggested he knew more.
“Mr. Cohen has knowledge
on certain subjects
that should be of interest
to the special counsel
and is more than happy
to tell the special counsel
all that he knows.”
Trump tried to play down
the momentous admission
via Twitter.
