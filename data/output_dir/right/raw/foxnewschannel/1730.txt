00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:11,935
COVERAGE OF FOX TOP STORY

4
00:00:11,935 --> 00:00:13,470
REPORT FROM SOUTH KOREAN

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,738
NEWS AGENCY THAT THE

6
00:00:14,738 --> 00:00:15,639
DICTATOR KIM JONG UN HAS

7
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:16,473
CANCELLED HIS MEETING WITH

8
00:00:16,473 --> 00:00:17,774
THE SOUTH KOREANS AND IS

9
00:00:17,774 --> 00:00:18,708
THREATENING TO CANCEL WHAT

10
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,210
WOULD BE AN HISTORIC SUMMIT

11
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:20,877
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

12
00:00:20,877 --> 00:00:22,679
THE REASON?

13
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:23,413
JOINT MILITARY DRILLS

14
00:00:23,413 --> 00:00:24,080
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES

15
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,917
AND SOUTH KOREA.

16
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:28,885
LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO

17
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:31,555
MICHAEL O'HANLON FROM THE

18
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:32,289
BROOKINGS INSTITUTION.

19
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:33,356
SENIOR FELLOW OF FOREIGN

20
00:00:33,356 --> 00:00:34,291
POLICY THERE.

21
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,125
MICHAEL, IT'S NICE TO SEE

22
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:35,392
YOU.

23
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:37,827
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU, SHEPARD.

24
00:00:37,827 --> 00:00:38,461
>> Shepard: THESE DRILLS

25
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:39,462
HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOREVER.

26
00:00:39,462 --> 00:00:40,697
THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE

27
00:00:40,697 --> 00:00:41,498
COMPLAINED ABOUT THEM

28
00:00:41,498 --> 00:00:42,299
FOREVER.

29
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:42,799
SUDDENLY THEY ARE

30
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:43,400
COMPLAINING ABOUT THEM

31
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,367
AGAIN.

32
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:46,303
>> AS USUAL YOU GOT RIGHT TO

33
00:00:46,303 --> 00:00:46,870
THE POINT.

34
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:47,904
THE IF YOU PLEASEY THING WAS

35
00:00:47,904 --> 00:00:49,105
THOUGH THEY DIDN'T COMPLAIN

36
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:50,640
THEM B. THEM FOR A COUPLE

37
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:50,974
MONTHS.

38
00:00:50,974 --> 00:00:53,710
IN FACT, WHEN THE SOUTH

39
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,711
KOREAN NATIONAL SECURITY

40
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:55,879
ADVISOR WENT TO NORTH KOREA

41
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,215
A FEW WEEKS AGO, IT WAS

42
00:00:58,215 --> 00:00:58,949
REMARKABLE THAT HE CAME BACK

43
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,150
WITH THE NEWS THAT KIM JONG

44
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,651
UN DIDN'T MIND THE

45
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:02,552
EXERCISES, SUPPOSEDLY.

46
00:01:02,552 --> 00:01:03,753
AND SAID THAT HE UNDERSTOOD

47
00:01:03,753 --> 00:01:05,221
WHY THEY HAD TO HAPPEN,

48
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:06,423
WHICH, OF COURSE, IS WHAT WE

49
00:01:06,423 --> 00:01:07,691
SAY AND WHAT WE FIRMLY

50
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:08,024
BELIEVE.

51
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:09,426
AS LONG AS THERE IS A

52
00:01:09,426 --> 00:01:10,093
POWERFUL MILITARY THREAT

53
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:11,828
FROM NORTH KOREA, EVEN IF

54
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:13,363
THE ATMOSPHERICS ARE BETTER

55
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:14,164
THESE DAYS, WE HAVE TO THAT

56
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:16,900
I

57
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,602
TAKETHAT THREAT SERIOUSLY.

58
00:01:18,602 --> 00:01:19,769
TWO BIG DRILLS FOR A YEAR

59
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:20,570
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

60
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,305
IT LOOKED AS IF NORTH KOREA

61
00:01:22,305 --> 00:01:22,872
WASN'T GOING TO CARE.

62
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:24,174
THAT WAS GOING TO BE

63
00:01:24,174 --> 00:01:25,308
APPARENTLY A CONCESSION.

64
00:01:25,308 --> 00:01:26,409
MAYBE THEY ARE STARTING TO

65
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:27,911
RETHINK THEIR TACTICS, MAYBE

66
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:28,878
THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE

67
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:30,380
GIVING AWAY TOO MANY

68
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,115
CONCESSIONS FOR FREE BEFORE

69
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:33,383
A NEGOTIATION OR MAYBE KIM

70
00:01:33,383 --> 00:01:34,818
JONG UN IS LOOKING FOR AN

71
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:36,152
EXCUSE TO GET OUT OF THE

72
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:36,920
SUMMIT ALL TOGETHER BECAUSE

73
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,288
HE DECIDES HE DOESN'T LIKE

74
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:40,156
THE PATH THAT HE IS HEADED

75
00:01:40,156 --> 00:01:42,092
ON TOWARDS DENUCLEARIZATION.

76
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:43,793
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF

77
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:44,294
POSSIBILITIES.

78
00:01:44,294 --> 00:01:45,195
>> Shepard: WHO SAYS HE IS

79
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,329
HEADED TOWARDS

80
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:46,830
DENUCLEARIZATION.

81
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,430
ONLY HE SAYS THAT.

82
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,865
HE HAS ALREADY GOTTEN A LOT

83
00:01:48,865 --> 00:01:50,066
HERE, HASN'T HE?

84
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:53,136
>> WELL, HE HAS GOTTEN A LOT

85
00:01:53,136 --> 00:01:54,971
OF DIPLOMATIC ATTENTION.

86
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:55,605
>> Shepard: THAT'S WHAT I

87
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:55,905
MEANT.

88
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:56,973
>> I BELIEVE THE CHINESE HAS

89
00:01:56,973 --> 00:01:58,074
LIGHTENED UP IN SOME OF

90
00:01:58,074 --> 00:01:59,175
THEIR ENFORCEMENT OF

91
00:01:59,175 --> 00:01:59,542
SANCTIONS.

92
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:00,677
THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO, BY

93
00:02:00,677 --> 00:02:01,778
THE WAY BUT THEY HAVE.

94
00:02:01,778 --> 00:02:02,946
OTHERWISE HE HASN'T GOTTEN

95
00:02:02,946 --> 00:02:05,115
MUCH CONCRETE OR TANGIBLE

96
00:02:05,115 --> 00:02:05,682
NOW YET.

97
00:02:05,682 --> 00:02:08,018
HE HAS GOTTEN PROMISE OF

98
00:02:08,018 --> 00:02:10,520
POTENTIAL DOWN THE ROAD IF

99
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,955
HE WHEN HE GIVES UP NUKES.

100
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:12,989
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

101
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:14,224
HOLDING UP THE LINE THE

102
00:02:14,224 --> 00:02:15,558
BENEFITS WON'T FLOW UNTIL

103
00:02:15,558 --> 00:02:16,559
ALL THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE

104
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:16,826
OUT.

105
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:17,494
I UNDERSTAND WHY PRESIDENT

106
00:02:17,494 --> 00:02:18,194
TRUMP WOULD BEGIN WITH THAT

107
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:18,928
GOING IN POSITION.

108
00:02:18,928 --> 00:02:20,497
I DON'T THINK IT'S REALISTIC

109
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:21,598
THOUGH AS A WAY TO GET

110
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:22,299
THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS.

111
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:23,500
SO MAYBE WHAT WE ARE SEEING

112
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,768
NOW IS KIM JONG UN STARTING

113
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:26,169
TO NEGOTIATE BACK BEFORE THE

114
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:28,538
TALKS EVEN BEGIN FACE TO

115
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:28,938
FACE.

116
00:02:28,938 --> 00:02:29,506
>> Shepard: WHAT DOES

117
00:02:29,506 --> 00:02:30,307
HISTORY TELL US ABOUT WHERE

118
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:31,341
WE ARE RIGHT NOW?

119
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:32,676
IT'S NOT AS IF WE HAVEN'T

120
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:33,877
REACHED THIS POINT OR

121
00:02:33,877 --> 00:02:34,711
SOMETHING SIMILAR IN RECENT

122
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:37,080
YEARS.

123
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,214
>> RIGHT.

124
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:39,482
WELL, THERE HAVE BEEN A

125
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:40,984
NUMBER OF SUMMITS WITH NORTH

126
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:41,284
KOREA.

127
00:02:41,284 --> 00:02:42,986
OF COURSE, THE PACE OF THESE

128
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:44,587
RECENT MEETINGS WITH

129
00:02:44,587 --> 00:02:45,722
SECRETARY POMPEO AND

130
00:02:45,722 --> 00:02:46,656
PRESIDENT MOON OF SOUTH

131
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,125
KOREA AND OTHERS HAS REALLY

132
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,527
INCREDIBLY INTENSIFIED AND

133
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:51,895
THE PROMISE OF A SUMMIT WITH

134
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:53,763
A U.S. PRESIDENT IS A

135
00:02:53,763 --> 00:02:54,898
FIRST-TIME THING,

136
00:02:54,898 --> 00:02:55,665
UNPRECEDENTED IN RELATIONS

137
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:56,366
WITH NORTH KOREA.

138
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:58,968
BUT, WE HAVE HAD PREVIOUS

139
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:00,403
PERIODS, SO-CALLED SUNSHINE

140
00:03:00,403 --> 00:03:02,572
POLICY OF ABOUT 18 OR 20

141
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:03,740
YEARS AGO AND SOUTH KOREA

142
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,874
REALLY TRIED TO BE WARM

143
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:06,009
TOWARDS THE NORTH WHEN KIM

144
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:07,610
JONG UN'S FATHER WAS IN

145
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,211
POWER THERE.

146
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:09,913
AND THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

147
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:12,515
YOU KNOW, THE SOUTH KOREANS

148
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:16,252
CHANGED PRESIDENTS.

149
00:03:16,252 --> 00:03:18,621
KIM JUDGE ILL BEHAVED MUCH

150
00:03:18,621 --> 00:03:18,922
WORSE.

151
00:03:18,922 --> 00:03:20,256
HE BROKE OUT OF A NUCLEAR

152
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:21,324
AGREEMENT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO

153
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:22,359
AT THAT TIME.

154
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:24,327
STATE OF BELLIGERENCE.

155
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:25,228
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING

156
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:26,763
THAT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST.

157
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:27,430
>> Shepard: I WANT TO READ

158
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,965
SOMETHING WE HAVE JUST

159
00:03:28,965 --> 00:03:29,299
GOTTEN.

160
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:30,467
THIS EXERCISE TARGETING US,

161
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:31,801
SAYS THE NORTH KOREANS,

162
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:33,636
WHICH IS BEING CARRIED OUT

163
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:36,406
ACROSS SOUTH KOREA, IS A

164
00:03:36,406 --> 00:03:40,977
FLAGRANT CHALLENGE TO PAN

165
00:03:40,977 --> 00:03:43,747
MOON JOM AND DECLARATION

166
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:44,748
RUNNING COUNTER TO THE

167
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:45,248
POSITIVE POLITICAL

168
00:03:45,248 --> 00:03:46,549
DEVELOPMENT ON THE KOREAN

169
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:46,916
PENINSULA.

170
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,051
AGAIN, THAT FROM THIS REPORT

171
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:49,853
THAT HAS JUST COME OUT.

172
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:52,021
QUOTING AGAIN, THE UNITED

173
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:54,124
STATES WILL ALSO HAVE TO

174
00:03:54,124 --> 00:03:55,925
UNDERTAKE CAREFULLY

175
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:57,560
DELIBERATIONS ABOUT THE FATE

176
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,964
OF THE PLANNED NORTH

177
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:01,698
KOREA-U.S. SUMMIT IN LIGHT

178
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:04,934
OF THIS PROVOCATIVE MILITARY

179
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:05,969
WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN

180
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:07,237
AUTHORITIES.

181
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:09,139
NOW, THAT SUDDENLY AND

182
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:10,306
FINALLY SOUNDS LIKE NORTH

183
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:12,675
KOREA AGAIN.

184
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:13,443
>> YEAH.

185
00:04:13,443 --> 00:04:14,911
ALL THOUGH THE WORD RUCKUS

186
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:17,313
IS PRETTY MILD BY THEIR

187
00:04:17,313 --> 00:04:17,747
STANDARD.

188
00:04:17,747 --> 00:04:18,214
>> Shepard: IT.

189
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:19,983
>> USUALLY FIND MUCH MORE

190
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:20,750
COLORFUL LANGUAGE.

191
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,885
POINT WELL-TAKEN.

192
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:23,186
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE A

193
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:26,389
LITTLE BIT OF BUYER'S

194
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:26,856
REMORSE.

195
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:28,491
THE NORTH KOREAS AREN'T

196
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:30,193
COMFORT WBLE DETAUNT WHEN IT

197
00:04:30,193 --> 00:04:31,461
HINGES ON THEM GIVING UP

198
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:32,729
NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THEIR

199
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:33,363
ENTIRETY REALLY FAST.

200
00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:37,033
I SEE THIS AS A EMPLOYEE

201
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:37,066
I SEE THIS AS P EMPLOYEE

202
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:37,100
I SEE THIS AS PLOMPLOYEE

203
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,133
I SEE THIS AS PLOYPLOYEE

204
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:37,167
I SEE THIS AS PLOY AOYEE

205
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:37,267
I SEE THIS AS PLOY ASYEE

00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:38,168
I SEE THIS AS PLOY AS AE

207
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:38,768
NEGOTIATION PROCESS.

208
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:39,569
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WANT

209
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:40,703
THE SUMMIT TO BE CANCELLED,

210
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:41,604
AT LEAST NOT YET.

211
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:42,605
THEY ARE TRYING TO SAY WE

212
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:44,174
ARE NOT GOING TO

213
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:44,207
ARE NOT GOING AO

214
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:45,208
ARE NOT GOING AS EASY AS

215
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:45,842
FIRST SEEN.

216
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:47,777
THEY HAVE THEN ABOUT THIS

217
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:48,278
UPCOMING EXERCISE

218
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:49,112
PHOTOGRAPHER AS YOU POINTED

219
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:50,513
OUT, SHEPARD, THEY EVEN SAID

220
00:04:50,513 --> 00:04:51,548
THEY DIDN'T CARE.

221
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:52,515
IF THEY ARE NOW GOING BACK

222
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:53,983
TO AN EARLIER COMPLAINT,

223
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:54,918
IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING

224
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:56,586
TO USE IT FOR A PURPOSE.

225
00:04:56,586 --> 00:04:58,321
EITHER AS A NEGOTIATING CARD

226
00:04:58,321 --> 00:04:59,789
OR BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST

227
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:00,890
NERVOUS ABOUT THE ENTIRE

228
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,058
PROCESS OF DETENTE AND THEY

229
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:04,093
WANT IT TO STOP AND JUST GO

230
00:05:04,093 --> 00:05:05,295
BACK TO WHERE WE WERE LAST

231
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:06,529
YEAR WHICH I WOULD REGRET

232
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:08,298
BUT IT WOULD BE TYPICAL OF

233
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:10,033
WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST.

234
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:10,600
>> Shepard: THE NORTH

235
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,701
KOREANS HAVE NOW GIVEN THE

236
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:13,036
UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION

237
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:14,537
AN INSTRUCTION.

238
00:05:14,537 --> 00:05:17,474
HOW MIGHT OUR ADMINISTRATION

239
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:18,842
RESPOND IN SUCH A WAY THAT

240
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:21,311
IT SERVES OUR INTERESTS?

241
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:23,146
>> WELL, WE HAVE TO KEEP

242
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:25,048
DOING MILITARY EXERCISES IN

243
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:26,382
SOUTH KOREA, AS YOU WELL

244
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:28,284
KNOW, SHEPARD, AND AS ANY

245
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:28,885
MILITARY OFFICER IN THE

246
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:30,019
UNITED STATES WILL INSIST

247
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:30,320
UPON.

248
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,987
I HAVE DONE SOME WRITING

249
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:32,422
OVER THE YEARS IN WHICH I

250
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:33,823
HAVE SUGGESTED WITH A

251
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,091
COLLEAGUE HERE THAT WE COULD

252
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:36,993
PERHAPS SCALE THEM BACK IN

253
00:05:36,993 --> 00:05:37,293
SIZE.

254
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:37,894
THAT THE SIZE.

255
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:39,696
EXERCISES IS NOT CRUCIAL TO

256
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:40,396
MILITARY READINESS.

257
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:42,532
IF IT REALLY GIVES NORTH

258
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:43,800
KOREANS SOME ANXIETY, WE

259
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,868
COULD FIND A WAY TO BREAK

260
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:45,935
THE EXERCISES UP INTO

261
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:46,736
SMALLER PIECES.

262
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:47,904
I THINK THAT'S MOST WE COULD

263
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:48,404
CONSIDER DOING.

264
00:05:48,404 --> 00:05:49,706
IF THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR

265
00:05:49,706 --> 00:05:50,740
THEM, I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE

266
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,741
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO

267
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:52,542
THINK THINGS THROUGH IN

268
00:05:52,542 --> 00:00:00,000
THOSE TERMS.
