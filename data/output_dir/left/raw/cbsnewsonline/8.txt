1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:02,335
THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO 

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:03,169
TAKING APPROPRIATE ACTIONS NOW, 

3
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:03,836
GIVEN THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY 

4
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:10,477
AVAILABLE TO THE UNITED STATES. 

5
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:11,311
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AT LEAST 

6
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,078
SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS 

7
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:12,812
RESPONSIBLE, INCLUDING THOSE IN 

8
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,147

AND OTHER SAUDI MINISTRIES WHO 

11
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:18,718
WE SUSPECT TO HAVE BEEN 

12
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:19,952
INVOLVED IN MR. KHASHOGGI'S 

13
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:20,387
DEATH. 

14
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,087
WE ARE TAKING APPROPRIATE 

15
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,354
ACTIONS WHICH INCLUDE REVOKING 

16
00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:24,557

AND OTHER MEASURES. 

18
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:29,529
WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH THE 

19
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,296
TREASURY DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW 

20
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:32,064
THE APPLICABILITY OF SANCTIONS 

21
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:39,072
TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS. 

22
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,273
THESE PENALTIES WILL NOT BE THE 

23
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:41,408
LAST WORD ON THIS MATTER FROM 

24
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:41,975
THE UNITED STATES. 

25
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:42,909
WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE 

26
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,144
ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO HOLD 

27
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:48,615
THOSE RESPONSIBLE. 

28
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:49,082
-- ACCOUNTABLE. 

29
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,116
WE ARE MAKING VERY CLEAR THAT 

30
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,084
THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT 

31
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,085
TOLERATE THIS KIND OF RUTHLESS 

32
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,988
ACTION TO SILENCE MR. KHASHOGGI,

33
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:55,922
A JOURNALIST, THROUGH VIOLENCE. 

34
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:56,756
WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A 

35
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:57,457
STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH THE 

36
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:58,958
KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA. 

37
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,160
NEITHER THE PRESIDENT NOR I AM 

38
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,929
HAPPY WITH THIS SITUATION. 

39
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:03,730
OUR SHARED STRATEGIC INTERESTS 

40
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,435
WITH SAUDI ARABIA REMAIN. 

41
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,269
WE CONTINUE TO DO AS 

42
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:09,836
ACHIEVABLE, THE TWIN 

43
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:10,937
IMPERATIVES OF PROTECTING 

44
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,906
AMERICA, AND HOLDING 

45
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,506
ACCOUNTABLE THOSE RESPONSIBLE 

46
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:14,807
FOR THE KILLING OF MR. 

47
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:22,649
KHASHOGGI. 

48
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:22,882
FOURTH. 

49
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:23,783
LAST WEEK, A DELEGATION OF 

50
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:24,450
CUBAN DIPLOMATS THROUGH A 

51
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,385
CHILDISH TEMPER TANTRUM AT A 

52
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,455
U.S. SPONSORED GATHERING.

00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,456
HIGHLIGHT THE CUBAN REGIME'S 

55
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:31,291
ITOLERANCE OF POLITICAL 

56
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,391
OPPOSITION AND THE PLIGHT OF 

57
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:35,528
LISTENERS. 

58
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:36,663
IN RESPONSE, I HAD WRITTEN A 

59
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,697

MEASURES THE U.N. WILL TAKE TO

00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,403
RESPOND TO THESE ACTIONS AND 

63
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,637
MAKE SURE THEY DO NOT HAPPEN 

64
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:53,513
AGAIN. 

65
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:54,647
AND FINALLY, IT'S MY HONOR TO

00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:55,648
TELL YOU THAT AMBASSADOR DAN 

67
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:56,516

00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,084
INSTITUTE, SOMETHING I INTEND 

70
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:58,952
TO DEVOTE A SIGNIFICANT PIECE 

71
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,353
OF MY TIME AND ATTENTION TO AS 

72
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:00,820
SECRETARY OF STATE. 

73
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,754
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT 

74
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,056
INSTITUTION FOR OUR FOREIGN 

75
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:03,556

76
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:04,457
DAN WILL LEAVE THE STATE 

77
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,024
DEPARTMENT INSTITUTIONALLY 

78
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:08,728
POSSIBLE FOR ALL OF OUR TEAM'S 

79
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:09,461
TRAINING AND THEIR CONTINUE 

80
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:10,029
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. 

81
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:10,697
DAN SHARES MY VISION. 

82
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:17,604
I KNEW HIM WHEN HE WAS HEAD OF 

83
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:18,804
I&R AND I WAS IN MY PREVIOUS 

84
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:19,072
ROLE. 

85
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,206
DAN SHARES MY VISION OF HAVING 

86
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,074
THE BEST TRAINED AND MOST 

87
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:21,708
PROFESSIONAL DIPLOMATIC CORPS 

88
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,475
IN THE WORLD.  

89
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,309
HE IS IMPECCABLY QUALIFIED FOR 

90
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,644
THIS ROLE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO 

91
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,980
HIM TAKING THE HELM AT FSI. 

92
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,281
I'M NOW HAPPY TO TAKE A FEW 

93
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:28,581
QUESTIONS. 

94
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:33,253
>> HE DOES HAVE A FEW MINUTES 

95
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:33,820
FOR QUESTIONS TODAY. 

96
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,587
WE ARE RUNNING LATE. 

97
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:34,954
MY APOLOGIES. 

98
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,322
>> THANKS, HEATHER AND MR. 

99
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,259
SECRETARY. 

100
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,760
>> I DON'T KNOW IF WE COULD ADD 

101
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,527
COLOR TO THE PRESIDENT'S 

102
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:44,731
COMMENTS, YOU JUST CALLED THE 

103
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,732
SAUDI OPERATION, OR THE ATTEMPT 

104
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:50,403
TO CONCEAL THE WORST COVER UP 

105
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,270
IN THE HISTORY OF COVERUPS. 

106
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,372
AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU AGREE 

107
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,506
WITH THAT CHARACTERIZATION. 

108
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,309
AND SECOND, IF YOU COULD BE 

109
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,343
LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT 

110
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,378
THE ACTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE 

111
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,212
VISA REVOCATIONS, HOW MANY, 

112
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,214
ROUGHLY, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. 

113
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:09,822
AND, THE MIGRANTS. 

114
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,324
WE ARE HOPING TO BE -- A LITTLE 

115
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,158
BIT DISINGENUOUS, WHEN THIS 

116
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:12,892
ADMINISTRATION HAS SLASHED THE 

117
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:23,569
NUMBER OF REFUGEES  THAT WILL 

118
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:23,836
ADMIT. 

119
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,204
>> I SAID I WOULD TAKE A COUPLE 

120
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,206
OF QUESTIONS, YOU JUST ASKED 

121
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:26,439
THREE. 

122
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,440
I ASSUME EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM 

123
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,177
WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IN YOU FOR 

124
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,211
TAKING ALL THE QUESTIONS. 

125
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,346
LET ME TAKE THE LAST ONE FIRST. 

126
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,447
THIS IS A NATION THAT IS 

127
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,214
HISTORICALLY GENEROUS FOR 

128
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,349
ACCEPTING REFUGEES FROM ALL 

129
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,183
AROUND THE WORLD. 

130
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,218
THERE IS NO MISTAKING THAT. 

131
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,352
IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO. 

132
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,453
THOSE WHO WANT TO COME HERE 

133
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,421
ILLEGALLY HAVE NEARLY EVERY 

134
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,722
MEANS AVAILABLE TO DO THAT. 

135
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:49,095
PEOPLE CAN ALSO FILE TO BE 

136
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:49,862
REFUGEES IN OTHER COUNTRIES 

137
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:50,997
OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES OF 

138
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:51,263
AMERICA. 

139
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:52,131
WHAT WE KNOW IS THIS. 

140
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:56,436
WE ARE A NATION BUILT ON LAWS. 

141
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,337
THE PRESIDENT HAS AN OBLIGATION 

142
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,004
TO PROTECT AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY 

143
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,205
AND TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS TO 

144
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,506
MAKE SURE WE KNOW WHO IS COMING 

145
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:04,177
IN AND OUT OF OUR COUNTRY IS 

146
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,311
NOT ONLY APPROPRIATE, BUT IS A 

147
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,245
DUTY OF THE UNITED STATES 

148
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:06,546
GOVERNMENT. 

149
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:07,580
WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE 

150
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,514
CONTINUE TO EXECUTE THAT WITH 

151
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:12,719
GREAT VIGOR AND PROFESSIONALISM.

152
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,953
SECOND, I WILL GET YOU THE 

153
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:14,220
NUMBERS. 

154
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,455
WE HAVE THEM, BUT I WANT TO 

155
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,555
MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY GETS A 

156
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:18,825
CHANCE TO SEE THE NUMBERS. 

157
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,392
THERE IS NOT A LOT MORE I CAN 

158
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:21,728
SAY, OTHER THAN TO SAY THIS IS 

159
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,695
CERTAINLY NOT THE LAST STEP 

160
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:23,363
THAT WE WILL TAKE. 

161
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,664
THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO OUR 

162
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,934
OWN EFFORTS, OUR OWN FACT-

163
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,204
FINDING, TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 

164
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:31,938
DECISIONS THAT THE UNITED 

165
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,139
STATES MAKES ARE BASED ON REAL 

166
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,741
DATA AND FACTS THAT WE CAN 

167
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:35,408
CONFIRM OURSELVES. 

168
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,275
WE WILL TAKE INFORMATION THAT 

169
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,844
COMES FROM OTHER SOURCES, THE 

170
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:42,515
TURKISH INTELLIGENCE SOURCES, 

171
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:42,815
THE SAUDIS. 

172
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:43,583
WE WILL VALIDATE THAT 

173
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,584
INFORMATION AND FORM OUR OWN 

174
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,451
JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE FACTS AND 

175
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,252
THEN HOLD THOSE RESPONSIBLE 

176
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,487
ACCOUNTABLE,  BASED ON THE FACT 

177
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,054
THAT WE DETERMINE ARE 

178
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:48,387
APPROPRIATE. 

179
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:49,388
WE WILL WORK WITH CONGRESS. 

180
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:50,489
I HAVE SPOKEN TO OUR ALLIES 

181
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:55,495
AROUND THE WORLD. 

182
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,529
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 

183
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,296
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE 

184
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:58,298
UNITED STATES DOES NOT BELIEVE 

185
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,632
THAT THE KILLING OF JAMAL 

186
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,168
KHASHOGGI WAS ANYTHING OTHER 

187
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:02,902
THAN A HORRIFIC ACT. 

188
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,103
AND WE HOPE WE CAN WORK 

189
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,138
TOGETHER BOTH WITH CONGRESS AND 

190
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,439
OUR ALLIES TO HOLD THOSE 

191
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,943
RESPONSIBLE ACCOUNTABLE. 

192
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,445
>> MR. SECRETARY, THANK YOU 

193
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,446
VERY MUCH. 

194
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:18,351
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT AFGHAN 

195
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:18,617
ELECTION. 

196
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:19,285
IT WAS VERY UNIQUE. 

197
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,887
WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THAT. 

198
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:21,988
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, PAKISTAN DID 

199
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:22,388
SOMETHING WRONG. 

200
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:30,296
AS YOU KNOW, THE INCIDENT, 

201
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,230
GENERAL ROZIQ HAS BEEN KILLED. 

202
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,231
SOME REPORTS SAID THAT PAKISTAN 

203
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,368
WAS BEHIND THAT ACTION.  

204
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,569
DO YOU THINK THAT IF PAKISTAN 

205
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,470
DOES NOT CHANGE THEIR POLICY, 

206
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:44,410
WHAT WILL BE THE NEXT ACTION TO 

207
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:44,676
PAKISTAN? 

208
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:45,445
TO CHANGE THEIR POLICY TOWARD 

209
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:45,778
AFGHANISTAN? 

210
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,113
>> I HAD A CHANCE TO TRAVEL AND 

211
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:51,617
MEET THE NEW LEADER TOO MANY 

212
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,018
WEEKS AGO. 

213
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,219
WE MADE CLEAR THAT THE U.S. 

214
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,554
POLICY WITH RESPECT TO SOUTH-

215
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,655
CENTRAL ASIA HAS NOT CHANGED. 

216
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,824
THAT OUR EXPECTATION WITH 

217
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,492
PAKISTAN WILL NOT PROVIDE SAFE 

218
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,993
HARBOR TO TERRORISTS, ON THE 

219
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,895
WESTERN BORDER. 

220
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:08,334
WE COULD NOT HAVE MADE THAT 

221
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,569
ANYMORE CLEAR AND THAT PAKISTAN 

222
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,303
WILL NOT HOLD THAT ACCOUNTABLE 

223
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,504
IF THEY ARE NOT SINCERE IN 

224
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:11,871
THEIR EFFORTS. 

225
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,072
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE CAN 

226
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,673
GET TO THE PLACE WHERE EVERYONE 

227
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:18,911
WANTS. 

228
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:19,544
EVERYONE WANTS RECONCILIATION 

229
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:19,945
IN AFGHANISTAN. 

230
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:20,880
AND TO ACHIEVE THAT, WE CANNOT 

231
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,114
HAVE A SAFE HARBOR FOR TELE-

232
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,216
BAN, AND FOR OTHERS INSIDE OF 

233
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,450
THE PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT. 

234
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:31,924
THAT'S OUR VIEW. 

235
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:32,692
ARE ADMINISTERED AND HAS MADE 

236
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:33,426
SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO HOLD 

237
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,460
THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND WE HOPE 

238
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,628
THEY WILL ACHIEVE THE GOAL THAT 

239
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,130
WE HAVE SET OUT FOR THEM. 

240
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,597
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. 

241
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:40,299
SECRETARY. 

242
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,568
GIVEN THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS, 

243
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,338
ABOUT THE WORST COVER UP EVER, 

244
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,572
DOES THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

245
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,641
STILL HAVE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE 

246
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,077
IN THE CROWN PRINCE MOHAMMED 

247
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,512
BIN SALMAN, AS A RELIABLE 

248
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:54,947
SECURITY PARTNER OF THE UNITED 

249
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:59,886
STATES, OR IS THERE A BELIEVE 

250
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,254
THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PART OF 

251
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,588
THE COVER-UP AND SHOULD 

252
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,224
TEMPORARILY STEP ASIDE UNTIL IT 

253
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:05,792
CAN BE INDEPENDENTLY 

254
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:06,526
ESTABLISHED, WHETHER HE PLAYED 

255
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,827
A ROLE OF ANY KIND IN THE 

256
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:11,898
KILLING OF MR. KHASHOGGI? 

257
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,132
>> WE ARE LEARNING THE FACTS. 

258
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:17,503
AND, AS FACTS UNFOLD, AND WE 

259
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,337

HOLD THOSE INDIVIDUALS 

267
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:32,218
ACCOUNTABLE WHEN WE DEVELOP 

268
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,221

269
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,422
AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO

LEARN FACTS. 

271
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:37,957
WE LEARNED A LOT OVER THE LAST 

272
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,391
FEW DAYS. 

273
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,825
WE HOPE TO LEARN A LOT IN THE 

274
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:40,827
NEXT 48 AND 72 HOURS. 

275
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,295
>> OUR LAST QUESTION. 

276
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:49,235
>> FOLLOWING UP, PRESIDENT 

277
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,202
ERDOGAN SAID TODAY THAT THIS 

278
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:51,137
WAS A SAVAGE AND PREMEDITATED 

279
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:51,437
MURDER.  

280
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,773
YOU SAID THAT THE SAUDI'S ARE 

281
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,575

YOU WERE PERSONALLY TOLD ONE 

286
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,157
STORY, AND IT HASN'T EVOLVED 

287
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,760
FOR DAYS. 

288
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,861
DO YOU THINK THAT THE SAUDI'S 

289
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:16,796
ARE STILL COVERING THIS UP? 

290
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,831
AND DO YOU FEEL MISLED BY THEM? 

291
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,598
DO YOU FEEL PERSONALLY MISLED 

292
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:26,505
BY THE CROWN PRINCE? 

293
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:27,507
DO YOU ACCEPT WHAT PRESIDENT 

294
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,207
ERDOGAN HAS SAID TODAY? 

295
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,575
>> I DON'T THINK I'VE SAID WHAT 

296
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,077
IT IS THE CROWN PRINCE TOLD ME. 

297
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:35,214
I STILL DO NOT INTEND TO. 

298
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,616
WE ARE GOING TO ACCEPT WHAT 

299
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,082

FOR OURSELVES. 

319
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,827
THE TURKS HAVE BEEN VERY 

320
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:28,968
COOPERATIVE WITH THIS. 

321
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:29,735

LEVELS, THERE IS POTENTIALLY A 

397
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:10,843
HIGHER POTENTIAL BEFORE THE 

398
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:11,676

POINT? 

408
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:39,538
>> Reporter: NOT GOOD.

ONE IN 300 MILLION. 

410
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:41,507
302 MILLION OR SO IS WHAT THE 

411
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:41,874

OVE SO MANY TIMES, BY 

416
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:45,644

POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS HAVE BEEN 

419
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:57,056
