what's wrong with the government trying to figure out what Russia was up to nothing wrong with the government doing that everything wrong with the government spying on a candidate of the opposition party that's a Watergate the spy game I mean and without any warning to him and now to compound that to make it into a criminal investigation bill that's why this is a rigged investigation that's why president's been right from the beginning Donald Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani is still out on TV for some reason and this morning he took to the Sunday show circuit to once again try and discredit Special Counsel Robert mullahs Russia investigation bring one appearance Giuliani claimed that Trump had been successful at draining the swamp this despite multiple controversies around cabinet members like Scott Pruett and reports about his personal lawyer Michael Cohen raking in consulting fees from companies with ties to Russia and Ukraine joining me now is stormy Daniels attorney Michael avenatti uh and thank you very much for being here Michael happy Memorial Day weekend happy Memorial Day weekend to you joy good morning good morning I wanted to give you an opportunity to sort of respond to and help us sort of decipher some of what Rudy Giuliani is saying as the attorney for Donald Trump let let me let you listen him on CNN this morning being asked about Michael Cohen and the recent controversies about him raking in consulting fees take a listen it's the upset with Michael Cohen for even attempting to sell access whether or not it worked he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't like that look I don't think his worst critics believe he likes that I mean he he definitely wants to do everything he can to drain the swamp in Washington but the most successful president doing that anything that even raises a question about that he's not gonna be happy about Michael you know some of the information about Michael Cohen selling access to the president has been uncovered through the work that you've been doing on stormy Daniels case and some of the discovery you've been able to bring out in what you have been of what you have seen and what you have disclosed have you seen any evidence that Michael Cohen was raking in these consulting fees in contravention to the wishes of Donald Trump no joy there's absolutely no evidence of that and it strains credibility to even suggest it this is a president that people that know em have routinely stated that he insists on knowing what's going on around him he absolutely despises people that are trying to make money on his back quote-unquote without his knowledge in my view there's no question that he knew what was going on here relating to Michael Cohen selling access and I think when the evidence comes out there's going to be substantial evidence that not only did he know about it but he participated in it and let me just say this this whole mantra by Giuliani of draining the swamp it's an absolute joke these guys have created a swamp within this administration that makes the Everglades look like a backyard plastic pool I mean they'll say and do anything at this point to distract away from the evidence that we continue to uncover to distract away from the molar investigation that is picking up steam I mean they will literally do anything to divert attention from the facts and the truth well we know that there is nothing illegal about essentially you know trying to trade on your relationship with someone to make yourself money right I mean there have been allegations that Michael Cohen tapes phone calls that he's set up these sort of taxi medallion schemes there's so much out there but I'm wondering if specifically you've been able to find or can document any evidence that he ever tried to conceal took any steps to conceal his activities from his client Donald Trump there's no evidence that he tried to conceal it from Donald Trump and I think there's evidence in fact to the contrary joy and you're correct that there may not be anything illegal per se but we believe that there's substantial illegal acts here relating to money laundering relating to failing to register as a foreign agent on behalf of foreign entities including those with Russian ties there's no question in our mind there's going to be some substantial federal charges criminal charges that are going to result from Michael Cohen's conduct and we believe that those are right around the corner and to that very point a couple of stories that we have just this week according to the BBC and I will note that NBC has not verified any of this information on Michael Cohen has disputed this story but the BBC uncovered that Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen received a secret payment of at least four hundred thousand dollars to fix talks between the Ukrainian president and Trump according to sources in Kiev close to those involved and you also have the New York Times reporting that inside Michael Cohen's office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower he met with a Russian oligarch named Viktor Vekselberg discussing a mutual desire to strengthen Russia's relations with the US and Trump according to Andrew in trader who of course we know wound up showing up at the inauguration and is cousins with mr. vekselberg in you're getting some of the information that is leading to this how does this relate to and why is this coming up as a result of the stormy Daniels lawsuit well joy you know for better or worse and we think it's better I mean we are becoming a repository of information people are sharing information with us on a daily basis we are encouraging people to do so these are true patriots in every sense of the word people that love their country that believe in truth that believe in bringing the evidence the american people and they are supporting our cause and they are providing information to us on a daily basis and I'm going to encourage people this morning to continue to do so because this is a very serious matter and the American people deserve to know the truth they deserve to have the facts and the evidence and we're going to continue to do what we've been doing and that is speaking the truth and and what you've been doing also is obviously trying to pursue the case for your client who wants to get out of this NDA with Donald Trump on Thursday you filed you and your team filed a motion to lift a stay there's a 90-day hold on the lawsuit over that NDA deal can you explain to us what's going on with the case the case in California was stayed temporarily for 90 days subsequent to that mr. Giuliani and mr. Trump went on national television and also by way of Twitter and shot themselves in the foot started talking about the details relating to the 100 thousand dollar payment etc we've now made a motion to lift that stay and what we're arguing joy is that there's no reason to stay the case in light of mr. Cohen's Fifth Amendment privilege because obviously mr. Giuliani and mr. Trump believe that they can defend themselves or attempt to as it relates to the charges in our case so we need to get on with our case I want a deposition of this president under oath I'm not interested in any further lies on Air Force One or lies to the media or lies through the White House spokesperson I want him to testify under oath and we're gonna lock him down as to some very serious questions about what he knew and when he knew it and what he did to cover up this hundred and thirty thousand dollar payment what he knew about essential consultants what he knew about what Michael Cohen was doing and we're gonna get to the bottom of this joy it doesn't matter if it takes a week a month or a year we're gonna get it done you know one of the consequences of stepping out to stepping forward particularly if you do so on social media is that you get attacked by BOTS you get attacked by people who support the president you become in your own right a public figure that's happened to you and you've experienced over the last couple of weeks personal attacks Apple research dug up on yourself is that something that you saw coming were you surprised by it and what is your reaction to it I anticipated it I did not anticipate people fabricating lies about my personal life twisting things in an effort to discredit me I think it's ironic that I'm the only attorney in the case or in these cases or you know there's over 13 mr. Trump mr. Cohen my client the US Attorney's Office I find it rather ironic that I'm the only one that they're digging around in their personal life and trying to discredit in some ways I wear it as a badge of honor joy because I think it shows that we're actually very effective we're believable the American people find us and find me to be credible and we're going to continue doing what we're doing I don't care what the cost is at this point on a personal level I'm not going to stop until we get to the bottom of this and we bring the truth and the evidence to the American people and people find out really what happened in connection with this cover-up because joy I'm going to tell you something the here is very very ugly and it gets more ugly by the day and the week and the president and mr. Giuliani can attempt to discredit Bob Muller they can attempt to fire him or shut down that investigation they can attempt to intimidate me and my client but we're not going away we're not packing up we're not going home period well as you've said you know you said you anticipated these attacks I mean it's been you know it's been very personal a lot of it it's you know and it's been very relentless at one point you even locked your Twitter account but I wonder if at some point it makes it more difficult for other people to come forward to talk to you for other people who may feel that they will then fall under the same attacks the same Apple research has it made it more difficult for you in for instance you talked about other women who are trying to come forward has that chilled that it has chilled it certainly joy to to a level we are doing everything in our power to avoid that and again there's a lot of Patriots in our country there's a lot of people that do not believe in what is happening right now believe that the truth needs to be told and they're coming forward these are very brave individuals and we're continuing to encourage people to do so and we're not changing we're not going to change what we've done over the last ten weeks it's been very very effective and we're gonna continue doing what we do which is speaking the truth and bringing evidence to bear and now what that results in we're gonna leave that to the American people and what they believe should result from it but we're gonna continue to do what we do there are obviously people who were paying a much greater sum than 130 thousand dollars then your client received for her NDA why do you suppose her case is the one that's attract meth attracting as much attention and these many attacks I think her case is attracting this much attention joy because of her credibility because the American people believe her because of the timing associated with this payment it late in the election in 2016 as a result of the media strategy that we have utilized over the last ten weeks as a result of us bringing additional evidence and facts to bear through the use of social media and otherwise as well as the fact that we've become a repop satori of information that people are sending us on a daily basis I think all of those factors have resulted in this case taking on a certain degree of prominence and I think it's only going to increase in the coming weeks and months as more and more evidence is out laid or provided the American people by us the high-stakes game michael avenatti is playing uh thank you very much for your time this this morning Thank You joy Thank You Rico you too and next up the Trump media strategy exposed they with us hey thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there for more am joy and the rest of MSNBC and click on any of the videos right here to watch the latest interviews and highlights and you can get more videos from MSNBC for free every day with our newsletters just visit msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up now
