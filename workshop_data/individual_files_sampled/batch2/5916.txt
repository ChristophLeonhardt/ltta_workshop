okay here's something that caught our attention check this out in July of 2010 the solid middle-of-the-road Quinnipiac poll asked voters about the upcoming congressional elections the first since Barack Obama was elected president they asked voters whether just generically speaking respondents preferred Republicans or Democrats for Congress this is the generic congressional ballot poll it's broken down by gender each year I can tell you that men have tended to prefer Republicans in July of 2010 men preferred Republicans by a margin of 13% women voters preferred Democrats by 2% the distance between the two the gender gap was 15 points next up the midterm congressional elections of 2014 men again preferred Republicans this time by 6 points women again preferred Democrats by 9 points and even with some shifting around you get the same gender gap again 15 points okay now look at this brand new polling still from Quinnipiac men say they lean toward Republican candidates for Congress by eight points down but fairly par for the course but women women say they lean toward Democrats by 25 points 25 that is a statistically huge number which gives us a gender gap of 33 points even among the wild things we've seen in US politics that is remarkable the divide between women and men over who should represent us in Congress in this result in Quinnipiac is not the only poll that we've seen pointing to a yawning divide we've seen the new the pupil put the gender gap at 22 CNN has said it was 34 percent in a new poll from NBC says it's 28 points now to be clear or seeing here four months out from the election is not just men typically going read and women typically going blue this is men leaning toward Republicans a little bit and women going for Democrats by a mile and that's without even breaking the poll out by gender and race how this plays out in November is anyone's guess but the election is remarkable already we'll be right back hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
