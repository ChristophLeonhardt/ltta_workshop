there's only one abortion clinic left in the state of Kentucky and right-wingers in the state are fighting tooth and nail in order to shut it down now this has been a long battle and a long fight in the state there are evangelicals who have been protesting and intimidating women who show up for their appointments and it got so bad that at one point a judge had to get involved a federal judge got involved and had to create a buffer zone in order to protect the women who went to that clinic now things continue to get bad and the protestors are planning on showing up to the homes of these abortion doctors to protest their which I would say is another form of intimidation now there's more details to this story in the CBS report let's take a quick look at that and I'll give you more abortion opponents started gathering at churches in Louisville over the weekend gearing up for citywide protests evangelical activist Jason storms and wife Sarah brought their eight children with them from Milwaukee along with a firm belief we have the wholesale legalized protected text subsidized killing the little human beings in the womb is to me just it is deplorable the group he belongs to operation save America calls Roe versus Wade a covenant with death and wants to close down the clinic the last remaining abortion provider in the state this is exactly why this matters Kentucky's abortion landscape is changing Republican governor Matt Bevin publicly opposes abortion and the GOP controlled legislature has passed new restrictions on abortion in May nearly a dozen protesters were arrested for blocking patients access to the clinic storm says they plan to be peaceful this time well they're certainly not committing violence on anybody on our side one of their activists told me that they don't espouse violence do you believe that no Anahola has been the clinic's director for 17 years how do you feel about being a target it's a fancy because these people outside believe that they have monopoly over God so watch the whole video in the link below in the description box great report by them yes actor was killed in his own house by people who thought he was committing murder of innocent babies so there they are talking about the murder of innocent babies and then they say we're gonna come to your house are you insane how is that not intimidation and if so if it had never happened in an abortion doctor and all they ever did was peaceful violence and they went to people's house that's still wrong okay because you're going to their house I mean it's daxing on a meta level and but knowing that the last time people went to people's houses somebody got shot in the head yeah it's this is crazy and instead of the government in Kentucky protecting the people who are under threat they're doing the exact opposite by encouraging and stoking their people which is why the federal judge had to get involved and create that buffer zone in order to protect patients who wanted to get to that clinic but look we've gone over this reproductive debate reproductive rights over and over and over again so you guys know where we stand on it but what I've always find so fascinating is this notion of Christians being persecuted in the country right like aa Christian persecution freedom of religion is under attack religious liberty is under attack no it's not here's the thing your evangelical cool you want to have eight kids cool you want to be like the Duggars and have 82 kids awesome okay that's your life do you boo you want to be miserable with the ton of kids that's great but guess what I don't want to have any kids right and guess what you don't get to dictate how many kids I have whether or not I can have kids whether or not I can have you know reproductive services available reproductive health services available for me that's your religion you'll get to live your life the way you want to live your life I get to live my life the way I want to live my life as long as I'm not harming other people who are they to tell us what is and isn't moral in our own lives you have your version of morality I have my version of morality in my version it's just uncalled for to get involved in women's lives in women's vaginas in their uterus and tell them what they can and can't do with it how about don't worry about me and you do you take care of your eight kids they remind me of of course Muslim fundamentalist Muslim let's tell you you can't draw the Prophet Mohammed no dude you can't throw the Prophet Mohammed I can draw anything I like it's not because I'm not Muslim you can't have an abortion no no no dude you can't have an abortion I'm not Christian I don't believe in the same who do you believe it so it's supposed to be a free country we're not a theocracy and we're not run by your fundamentalist vision of your religion and by the way knucklehead read the Bible numbers 5 5 11 through 31 God is pro-abortion you're even wrong about the thing that you are so adamant about oh my god God tells me to intimidate you and everyone's allowed to shoot you because I'm pro-life no he doesn't God is in favor of abortion you've your whole identity is based on a lie so well that's fine you want to delude yourself and and do things that make no sense to other rational human beings do it in your own Becket that's why it's great that it's a free country exactly I don't care unlike you I'm not in your business I have 28 kids and like believe that the Bible says things it doesn't say it doesn't I don't care I want you to be free that's the difference between me and you I will fight for your freedom you want to take our freedom away or because it says in my Bible but that we're not run by your Bible we're run by the Constitution and if you don't like it get out because you are on American at the very core of America is that freedom to believe anything you want we shall not establish a religion and if you don't like it go join the Taliban because you would be very welcome there help us build an independent media together come join us TYT Network comm / join
