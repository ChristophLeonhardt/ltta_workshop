the mystery surrounding the disappearance of a Saudi journalists in Turkey has taken a twist as reports suggest Riyadh was planning to detain him media in the u.s. says Washington had come across Intel of a special operation ordered by the Saudi Crown Prince Jamal khashoggi vanished 10 days ago after entering the sandi consulate in Istanbul and hasn't been since seen since Saudi Arabia denies any involvement joining me to discuss this further is a jackeline of Wooga jackie this has had a few twists and turns hasn't it it looks like the u.s. may have been aware of an imminent threat to the journalists well initially the Trump administration was rather slow in responding to the disappearance and this really may indicate why earlier in the week reports surfaced that the u.s. had intercepts of Saudi officials discussing a plot to lure him back to Saudi Arabia and detain him there now he is of course been living in the US for about a year now at this point and he writes for The Washington Post he's a journalist and a lot of his articles are rather critical of the Saudi government now it's unclear when the US may have intercepted this intelligence and if they may have acted on it but it does raise quite a few questions not least of which being whether or not they had a responsibility to warn the journalists that his life might be in danger in some way shape or form now on Wednesday a State Department official did come out saying that they did not have any prior knowledge of the incident though I cannot comment on intelligence matters I can say definitely the United States had no advanced knowledge of the Shah jees disappearance so while these reports are based on you know again unnamed sources more than one element to have confirmed them at this point and then one has to wonder whether or not this is a situation where the left hand just doesn't know what the right is doing then in the US government because at the same time we have a group of almost two dozen senators who were up in arms about the situation if we find out that they were complicit or directedness in any way and no relationship like that is appropriate and this is seriously I think it's important in this situation that we we don't overreact or in the react we need to get the facts and I know that's a startling proposition for the United States Congress that we should get the facts before we act if this did happen and it's increasingly likely that something bad happened to this man at the hands of the Saudi government and that shows contempt for us that's disrespectful to us so there we have calls for an investigation the word sanctions has already been brought up and there has even been a bipartisan movement to stop arms sales to the kingdom which would be a huge blow to ties between the two powers of course but that's something that apparently Trump is not willing to consider as of yet I don't like stopping massive amounts of money that's being poured into our country and I know they're talking about different kinds of sanctions but they're spending a hundred and ten billion dollars on military equipment and on things that create jobs like jobs and others for this country so he did go on to say that US investigators are looking into the situation but left it at that so many conflicting reactions there aren't there what kind of investigation should we expect Jackie well on Thursday a Turkish presidential aide did come out saying that there is going to be an enjoined investigation with Turkey and Saudi Arabia and reports say that a delegation from Riyadh has already landed in Turkey but it's unclear how well that's going to work given the harsh accusations that we've had coming from the Turkish side it's been alleged that Turkey actually has audio and visual recordings of the incident that proved their claims that kesaji was killed inside the consulate on October the second certain articles quote people with quote-unquote knowledge of the reporting recordings saying that you can hear him being tortured and questioned interrogated and then killed but these recordings have yet to be released previously Turkey had claimed that there was a 15 man hit group that murdered and dismembered the journalist while he was in the consulate and then removed his body from the site now there has been no concrete evidence of that yet and that's something that does need to be stressed at this point and Saudi Arabia does flat-out deny all the accusations saying that they are baseless their position remains that he left the consulate unharmed later that day and it's a mystery until that joint investigation gets underway isn't it Thank You Jacqueline booga their reporting for us you
