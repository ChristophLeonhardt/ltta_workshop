ENDED UP KEEPING HIS CREDIT CARD

81
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,752
AND THEN SPENDING LAVISHLY ON

82
00:02:39,753 --> 00:02:41,549
IT, THEN LIED ABOUT IT

83
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:41,948
AFTERWARDS.

84
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:43,844
ONCE IT WAS SAID THAT HE WAS

85
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:45,375
GOING TO PRESS CHARGES, THEN SHE

86
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,239

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,761
MOCKERY OR AN ATTACK, THEY ARE

99
00:03:08,762 --> 00:03:11,090
THE SAME MEDIA WHO THOUGHT MATT

100
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,420
DAMON'S RIDICULE OF KAVANAUGH

101
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:15,680
WAS SPARKLING AND BRILLIANT AND

102
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:17,410
DARING.

103
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:18,142
THEY FIND TRUMP SAID SOMETHING

104
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:20,870

HE DID WAS POINT OUT A

WHAT TRUMP DID, IF THAT WAS AN

109
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,222
ATTACK, THEN YOU REALLY DO LIVE

110
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:29,819
IN A BUBBLE.

111
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,281
IF YOU GO HOME OR GO TO A BAR OR

112
00:03:32,282 --> 00:03:33,279
TALK TO SOMEBODY AT THE GYM,

113
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,572
WHAT TRUMP SAID IS EXACTLY THE

114
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:39,366
OPINIONS OF EVERYBODY AT HOME

115
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:40,032

IS REVEALING THE CONTRAST OF THE

123
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:01,289
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EXPRESSION

124
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,387

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,514
CREDIBLE AND COMPELLING.

127
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:07,077
BUT THEN THEY GO HOME AND GO

128
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:07,377
DUDE.

129
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:10,471
SHE IS NOT MAKING SENSE.

130
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:12,267
REMEMBER, HE SAID AT THE

131
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:13,065
BEGINNING, COMPELLING.

132
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:15,228
BUT THEN WHEN HE GETS TO RALLY

133
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:17,224
TRUMP, HE BECOMES LIKE EVERYONE

00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:18,022
ELSE AND SAYS THERE'S SOME

135
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:21,415

WHO MOLESTED YOU.

177
00:05:37,264 --> 00:05:37,962
DON'T ASSUME BRETT KAVANAUGH

INSULTING.

186

THE LAWYER FOR FORD SAID THIS IS

187
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:57,523
WHY WOMEN DON'T COME FORWARD.

00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:03,710
>> Greg: SIMPLE DISCREPANCY.

191
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:05,706
>> Jesse: SARAH SANDERS WAS

192
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:06,704
ASKED ABOUT THIS TODAY.

193
00:06:06,705 --> 00:06:09,133
LET'S HEAR WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY.

194
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:11,295
>> IT WASN'T ANYTHING OTHER THAN

195
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:12,127
THE PRESIDENT STATING FACTS,

196
00:06:12,128 --> 00:06:16,252
FACTS WERE LAID OUT IN THE

197
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:17,117
PROSECUTOR'S MEMO THAT SHE PUT

198
00:06:17,118 --> 00:06:18,880
FORWARD TO THE SENATE.

199
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:21,475
IT'S DISGRACEFUL WHAT THEY HAVE

200
00:06:21,476 --> 00:06:23,271
DONE AND EXPLOITED THIS PROCESS.

201
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:24,236
THEY EXPLOITED DR. FORD.

202
00:06:24,237 --> 00:06:25,300
THEY ARE EXPLOITING ALL THE

203
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,496
WOMEN WHO HAVE COME OUT TO MAKE

204
00:06:27,497 --> 00:06:29,292
ANY TYPE OF ACCUSATION.

205
00:06:29,293 --> 00:06:30,324
THIS ISN'T THE PROCESS THAT

206
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:31,488
SHOULD'VE BEEN DONE AND

207
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:33,218
CERTAINLY EVERYBODY DESERVES TO

208
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:34,183
BE HEARD THAT INCLUDES JUDGE

209
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:35,147
KAVANAUGH.

210
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:36,711
>> Jesse: I JUST GOT A FRESH

211
00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:37,443
TEXT FROM MOM.

212
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:40,204
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO YOU.

213
00:06:40,205 --> 00:06:42,034
"I SINCERELY HOPE DANA

214
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:42,932
ESTABLISHES THE TONE TONIGHT

215
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:44,994
REGARDING ATTACKING THE VICTIM."

216
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:46,425
HERE YOU GO, DANA.

217
00:06:46,426 --> 00:06:49,785
>> Dana: I WAS -- FERRIS

218
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:51,980
SANDERS REPRESENTS HER BOSS WELL

219
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:55,374
SANDERS REPRESENTS HER BOSS WEL.

220
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,505
NOBODY TALKS LIKE TRUMP.

221
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:57,170
NO ONE CAN OUT TRUMP TRUMP.

222
00:06:57,171 --> 00:07:00,929
YOU ARE THE PRESS SECRETARY.

223
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,457
SHE DID HER BEST THERE.

224
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,356
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS SAYING

225
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,285
WAS BASICALLY READING FROM THE

226
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:09,013
TRANSCRIPT OF THE HEARING.

227
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:09,711
IT'S THE TONE.

228
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:11,109
LIKE YOUR MOM SAID.

229
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,539
FOR ME TO SET THE TONE FOR THE

230
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,435
PRESIDENT HAS A TONE THAT DOES

231
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:15,899
SOUND LIKE HE'S GOING AFTER YOU.

232
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,028
LIKE FOR ME, YOU KNOW I HATE

233
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:18,527
NICKNAMES.

234
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:20,290
I GET IT THAT THEY WORKED IN

235
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,120
THAT THEY ARE VERY EFFECTIVE.

236
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:23,184
I DO WONDER ABOUT THE STRATEGY

237
00:07:23,185 --> 00:07:26,877
LATER ON BECAUSE FLAKE,

238
00:07:26,878 --> 00:07:30,969
MURKOWSKI, COLLINS, THEY WOULD

239
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,497
NEVER SAY THIS KIND OF THING.

240
00:07:33,498 --> 00:07:35,094
THEY ARE ALREADY UNDER A TON OF

241
00:07:35,095 --> 00:07:36,059
PRESSURE.

242
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,088
THEY ARE WAITING FOR THIS FBI

243
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:38,421
REPORTS.

244
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:39,818
THE PRESIDENT NEEDS THEIR VOTE.

245
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:42,612
I THINK, FROM A STRATEGY

246
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:44,641
STANDPOINT, DO YOU GET THE

247
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:47,602
COUNTRY WITH YOU AND LOSE THOSE

248
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:49,033
THREE VOTES AND THEN END UP

249
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:50,729
WINNING IN 2020 BECAUSE PEOPLE

250
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,393
ARE SO MAD?

251
00:07:52,394 --> 00:07:53,989
OR DO THOSE PEOPLE, THOUGH

252
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,917
SENATORS COME AWAY FOR THE FBI

253
00:07:56,918 --> 00:07:57,383
REPORT.

254
00:07:57,384 --> 00:07:58,580
IF IT'S CLEAN, THEY HAVE NO

255
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:01,375
REASON NOT TO VOTE FOR HIM.

256
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:03,470
IF THE FBI REPORT COMES BACK AND

257
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:04,069
IS FINE.

258
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,331
>> Judge Jeanine: I REALLY

259
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:07,662
BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP ALWAYS HAS

260
00:08:07,663 --> 00:08:09,192
BOTH SITUATIONS COVERED.

261
00:08:09,193 --> 00:08:10,523
HE HAS THE PUBLIC SITUATION

262
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:11,321
COVERED AND THE POLITICAL.

263
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:14,149
THAT'S WHY HE PLAYS TO HIS BASE

264
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,613
AND HE ALSO IS TRYING TO

265
00:08:15,614 --> 00:08:17,376
LEVERAGE HOWEVER WAY HE CAN GET

266
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:18,707
THESE SENATORS.

267
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:19,472
>> Dana: I THINK HE WILL END

268
00:08:19,473 --> 00:08:27,256
UP WITH -- EVEN IF HE LOSES

269
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,189
FLAKE, DIZZY PICKUP

270
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:38,434
MANSION -- DOES HE PICKUP

271
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,163
MANCHIN?

272
00:08:40,164 --> 00:08:41,626
>> Jesse: WE HAVE ALL SEEN

273
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:42,026
TRUMP MOCK.

274
00:08:42,027 --> 00:08:46,018
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS HIM

275
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:46,418
MOCKING.

276
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:48,214
>> Greg: PEOPLE PUTTING THEIR

277
00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:48,846
SPOTLIGHT ON AVENATTI AND

278
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:53,470
LETTING IT RIDE IN THEN YOU HAVE

279
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:55,167
TRUMP BRING UP A SIMPLE

280
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:55,965
DISCREPANCY.

281
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:57,396
YOU CALL THAT ATTACKING?

282
00:08:57,397 --> 00:08:58,394
GIVE ME A BREAK.

283
00:08:58,395 --> 00:09:00,024
>> Juan: I WILL GIVE YOU A

284
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:00,323
BREAK.

285
00:09:00,324 --> 00:09:03,184
THAT WAS AN ATTACK.

286
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:05,978
IN OTHER WORDS, EVERY WOMAN IN

287
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:06,344
AMERICA --

288
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,340
>> Greg: IT'S NOT EVERY WOMAN.

289
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:09,904
>> Juan: OH, THEY ARE ALL

290
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:10,303
SNOWFLAKES.

291
00:09:10,304 --> 00:09:11,567
WANT YOU JUST SHUT UP AND MOVE

292
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:11,966
ON.

293
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,031
NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

294
00:09:13,032 --> 00:09:14,528
>> Greg: THAT'S NOT WHAT IT

295
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:14,794
IS.

296
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:15,659
>> Juan: PART OF THE ISSUE

297
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:21,181
WITH THE FBI, THE FBI -- THE

298
00:09:21,182 --> 00:09:22,911
PRESIDENT SAID HE FOUND FORD

299
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:23,676
CREDIBLE.

300
00:09:23,677 --> 00:09:25,140
NOW HE CHANGES HIS TUNE BECAUSE

301
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:28,500
HE WANTS TO PLAY TO YOU, GREG.

302
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:32,658
>> Jesse: JUAN, JUAN.

303
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:33,523
>> Judge Jeanine: EVERY WOMAN

304
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:37,183
IN AMERICA WHO HAS BEEN A VICTIM

305
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:38,347
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT REMEMBERS MORE

306
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:39,145
THAN CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD.

307
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:39,545
I KNOW.

308
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,272
I DID THIS FOR 30 YEARS.

309
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:43,869
>> Juan: I AM SAYING YOU THINK

310
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,200
YOU ARE SPEAKING TO EVERY WOMAN.

311
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:46,032
>> Judge Jeanine: KNOW, WHAT

312
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:48,660
I'M TELLING YOU IS FOR YOU TO

313
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:50,090
SAY BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS

314
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:50,822
POINTING OUT INCONSISTENCIES IN

315
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,252
HER OWN TESTIMONY THAT HE IS

316
00:09:52,253 --> 00:09:54,016
SUGGESTING TO OTHER WOMEN WHO

317
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:55,446
HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED THAT HEY,

318
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:57,242
LOOK, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE

319
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:59,006
YOU, IT'S NOT THE CASE.

320
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:00,403
WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED

321
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:01,567
ARE ASKING THE SAME QUESTION.

322
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,230
WHY DO I REMEMBER?

323
00:10:03,231 --> 00:10:08,952
WHY DO I --

324
00:10:08,953 --> 00:10:10,383
>> Juan: MOST WOMEN WHO WERE

325
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:11,547
VICTIMIZED DON'T REPORT IT

326
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:11,913
BECAUSE --

327
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:15,173
>> Judge Jeanine: NO KIDDING.

328
00:10:15,174 --> 00:10:16,570
WHAT THEY FEAR IS NOT THE

329
00:10:16,571 --> 00:00:00,000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
