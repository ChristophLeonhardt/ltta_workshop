Joe so many questions legally facing Donald Trump there three were looking at this morning including whether or not Cohen will flip who wouldn't flip if your entire life is on the line well I liked the the the antic tell where one of his lawyers said okay if 100 is complete loyalty towards you mr. president Michael Cohen is a 1 when it comes to flipping I don't know if that's quite the case but the man has absolutely no reason to remain loyal to somebody who again has put him in the same position that others have been put in before you know John Heilemann Michael Cohen knows where this story ends all he has to do is look at the four or five people that are already cooperating with Muller's camp with with Muller's investigation and the disinformation campaign from Donald Trump is no match for facts no match for investigators but it does seem that the Southern District of New York investigation is what is seen as an existential threat inside the White House and it is why many staff members are basically trying to figure out which is the first family member that's gonna be going to jail right I mean look Michael Kohn not only knows where this is headed he knows that it in a great degree of detail because he knows exactly what he's done in service to Donald Trump he's he's been you know we've said a million times now he claimed proudly calls himself the president's fixer but what that's meant in the course of his service of Donald Trump is he served as a global business development adviser he's run around the four corners of the of the planet trying to get Donald Trump's name on two big buildings and and in the process of doing that is we know even in about civil Isaac knew York City that's a business in which you there's a lot of shortcuts and there's some dirty deals that get done and things that's are right at the edge of legality and illegality even in the best circumstances there's often organized crime it's attached to that there's often we get tricky financial transactions when you're talking about other places Moscow as per one but many other countries where Donald Trump has tried to do business or has done business the things get even shadier so Michael Cohen knows exactly what he's done right he knows exactly where he's crossed the line or come close to crossing the line and my guess is that what's been fascinating over the course of this last week is just the fact that no one even bothers to go on television who knows Michael Cohen he knows Donald Trump who knows the nature of this business no one goes on television and says Michael Kahn is not innocent of any crimes that man has never done anything wrong it's baked into the cake among people who know that there's improprieties and the legalities here so I look I mean we've all read now these stories about the way the Trump treated Cohn we all know what Cohen is facing potentially I just think that you know the likelihood that he's gonna somehow take the bullet for Donald Trump as he put it previously when he was speaking in metaphor now that it's not metaphor anymore I think it's just extraordinarily low when what's so extraordinary Mika is you have the President of the United States saying hey I know Michael Cohen's not going to flip has admitted that there is information that he has right that he can quote flip the Robert Knoller so if we take him at his word and we take Michael Cohen at his word Mimi who is in his all he has talked about it is loyalty to trump we haven't heard anything else from him halfway you know how the southern district works what would be the reasons that he wouldn't flip are there any sure I mean in my experience first of all people who say they're not going to flip at this stage to the game it's it's too early to tell they change their mind quite often and I'm talking about people who have every incentive not to cooperate like organized crime members members and violent gangs you know so when the the poll is very strong as it must be here for Michael Cohen and must be a very pull strong to Don a strong pull to Donald Trump they still cooperate quite often and but look if he doesn't cooperate it's going to be probably out of loyalty because he and or because he decides to take the case to trial which you know is his right to do but I think what's important here is a couple of things wanted to keep in mind that it's too early to tell no matter what he's saying now it's gonna change he hasn't seen yet the strength of the case against him which my impression is it's going to be strong or they wouldn't have gotten that search warrant and the second thing that's important to know is that if he does cooperate I do think he's going to be a very valuable cooperator because people who are that those are the people you do need to cooperate are the people on the inside possibly be Nick the most valuable cooperator if you really think about it he's got everything look he's the fixer and the fixer fix his problems and so he knows where the problem Oh Lord but just watch the Kabuki theater I mean isn't that the same phrase again but over the last week we've seen the president's allies his former lawyer insult Cohn in public right saying he's a he's a snitch he'll turn over it's the politics of kicking your dog what they're trying to do was establish that he is a submissive one in the relationship and reminding of his place in Trump world while also discrediting him as somebody who might flip you know he's going to turn over he's afraid of being raped in prison we saw that that strange quote from some former lawyer it is a psychological exercise of power that Trump is applying against his own guy so I mean just who would want to live in that extremely pathetic position I'm not really sure so I think the potential to flip might be there who knows Jake sure thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on
