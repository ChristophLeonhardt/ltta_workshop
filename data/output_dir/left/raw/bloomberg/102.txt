1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,620
With SUV’s growing in popularity, it only made sense to get some on this show.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,680
So, in this review, we’re going to compare three of the best rated luxury SUV’s on the market.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,240
This isn’t going to be easy.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,240
We got our hands on an Audi Q5, a Porsche Cayenne GTS, and a BMW X5.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,440
I’ve decided to spend a day in the Hamptons with each of them, to get an in-depth look.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,100
Now this is This is the Q5, it’s Audi’s mid-sized SUV

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,100
and it starts at about $41,000.

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,500
Which is way more affordable than the other two cars that we’re looking at.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,280
This is kind of like the IPhone of luxury SUV’s. It’s designed so well

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,380
but it’s also affordable within the segment.

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:55,380
This is a 4-cylinder all-wheel drive, 7 speeds, automatic with paddle shifters. 252 horsepower, and there’s no lag.

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,260
Immediate power, immediate response, the minute you step on the gas, you’re there.

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,420
The Q5 has by far the most futuristic interior of the three cars. It’s minimal, It’s clean.

14
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,620
The sunroof spans the entire width of the ceiling. It’s really cool

15
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:21,760
There’s plenty of room for 5 adults, lots of headroom, but this is the smallest car of the ones that we’re testing.

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,060
The trunk is 29 cubic feet,

17
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,240
which is in the middle of our range. A family on a trip might have trouble fitting everything in.

18
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,120
There are other cars that are more powerful, that look more distinct,

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,140
but it’s also really affordable and Audi has really kind of hit a sweet spot.

20
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,680
So how did it add up?

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,580
The immediate response really made me feel in control. The Horsepower was a little weaker at 252

22
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,680
and the 22 mpg means this is the middle of the road.

23
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,440
Looks-wise, it was a bit conservative.

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:02,180
It’s the smallest of our three but with a sleek interior
And the pricing is the best at 41 thousand dollars.

25
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:15,440
Now this is the BMW X5 hybrid. That means it gets 56 miles per gallon combined between the electric motor

26
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,420
and the conventional engine. This car starts at $62,000, so it’s right in the middle of our group.

27
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,140
The electric motor and the engine switch off depending on what drive mode, how fast you’re going, all of that.

28
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,080
What you won’t find out from the stats on the website, is how big this car feels when you sit in it,

29
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,880
and how small it drives. It’s a nice balance.

30
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:43,140
So, the interior, it’s not as futuristic, it’s not as clean and modern feeling, but it’s also a little less full of

31
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,280
buttons and levers and gauges

32
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,500
This does feel like it’s the roomiest of the three.

33
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,360
I think a lot of it has to do with the natural light. The most visibility for sure.

34
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,000
And with the seats in use, the trunk still comes up with nearly 36 cubic feet, which is massive.

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,760
To recap, The handling was exceptional. 308 horsepower is middle of our range.

36
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,180
And an amazing 56MPG with the combined electric motor. It was sporty without being over aggressive.

37
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,940
The roomiest but with a toned-down interior.

38
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,160
And at 62K, it’s midrange for our selection.

39
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:33,980
Now the third car in our group is a Porsche Cayenne GTS. This is a higher tuned version of Porches Cayenne

40
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:40,040
and it starts fittingly at 97 thousand dollars, that’s by far the most expensive of any car of our group

41
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,040
and it’s also our most powerful.

42
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,180
Porsche was among the first of the luxury car makers to introduce an SUV.

43
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,600
It really sets the standard for a lot of things.

44
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,560
The engine here is a 3.6 liter V6 twin turbo charged engine.

45
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,260
440 horsepower, it’s almost double the horsepower of the Audi.

46
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,820
443 foot pounds of torque,

47
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,360
and you definitely feel it when you push the gas pedal.

48
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,980
The thing that you notice, are the buttons, and levers, and knobs,

49
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,760
and vents. So, if you’re someone who likes those cockpit stuff to play with,

50
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,400
you’re going to love this car.

51
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:21,360
This trunk was actually the smallest at 24 cubic feet.  but after you put the seats down, you’ll get by.

52
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,240
It drives fast. it feels really luxurious inside. it’s really striking to look at.

53
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,140
It just costs a lot of money

54
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,440
Ok, This car was the most powerful. 440 horsepower 434 foot-pounds of torque.

55
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,680
Unfortunately, only 19 mpg combined.

56
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,680
This is a true sports car in SUV form,

57
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,920
It had decent space and the interior was loaded with gadgets.

58
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,580
But the downside I’d say is price. 97 thousand dollars, means this car will dig deep in your wallet.

59
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,560
The luxury SUV segment is a competitive field.There are a lot of really confident players.

60
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,480
And these three are all excellent vehicles.

61
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,520
However, after three days of driving, I felt the BMW checked the most boxes

62
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,720
in terms of performance, agility, and style, and value.

63
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:18,040
Was it the fastest or most powerful? No. But it was the most versatile while moderately priced for a luxury SUV.

64
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,260
With the largest interior, the most visibility, and the fact that it’s a hybrid

65
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,780
with a 56 miles per gallon rating, that just pushes it over the edge.

66
00:05:25,780 --> 00:00:00,000
This car is a great value, and anyone would be happy to have it.
