well I have a solution tell people not to come to our country illegally that's the solution don't come to our country illegally come like other people do come legally very simply we have laws we have borders don't come to our country illegally it's not a good thing yeah you know and I think a lot of Americans agree with you I know I certainly do don't come to America illegally get in line like everybody else that said I also think most Americans agree with me that it should not be US policy to rip babies infants toddlers from their mothers arms and then scatter them across America in a way that actually has them lost and has our government trying to figure out how to unite parents and toddlers infants children but that's what's happening and with us now we bring in the ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Democratic congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland Elijah it is always great to see you thanks for being here it's good to be here Jenna yeah Elijah Micah's been asking for several weeks where are the children it's a simple basic straightforward question there are some that suggest that the government knows exactly where the children and the parents are and they know how to unite them that doesn't seem to actually be the case on the ground what can you tell us I can tell you that I think nobody really knows where all these children are and where their parents are and I don't think that that and the reason for that gel is because there was never an intention from the very beginning to reunite these children with their parents you know something as simple as an armband like they give you when you're going to hospital put one on the parent put one on the child and be able to you know to match them up this is not rocket scientist stuff but now we're in a situation where because they did not properly plan because they executed this zero-tolerance policy in a way that had no forethought and and as a matter of fact it looks for me like a very mean thing the Trump administration has done we've got children who may never sadly be reunited with their parents but one thing I am glad about and that is the judges taking a real hard line with the the government and saying you've got to get this done and continuing to pressure them very very hard congressmen that clearly you're speaking about a crisis that is of the moment today but if you think about this I mean we've been talking about immigration reform legislation to figure out exactly how to do this since Alan Simpson and Ted Kennedy began talking about it in the mid-1980s so that my question to you is given the nature of politics today given that given the polarization in both the house and the Senate do you think it's possible that in our lifetime your lifetime in my lifetime that there'll be some legislation passed to deal with this constant issue in a common-sense way well I really hope so and that's why I was very pleased that congressman Mehta was the head of the freedom party and certainly Republican and one of our most conservative Republicans joined with me in asking for chairman Gowdy of the Oversight Committee to do a hearing where we began to explore exact for small what's happening with these children trying to make sure it doesn't happen again but also looking at how do we put ourselves in the position we're not constantly revisiting this situation but to go back to your questions I think the parties are so divided and with President Trump saying the kind of things that he's been saying it doesn't help Ric single congressman good morning to follow up on Mike's question so let's even put aside this idea that we that there'll be a comprehensive immigration policy that might not even happen in our lifetime as Mike said is there something that the house can do that Congress can do right now about legislation that prevents the US government from separating young people infants toddlers from their family this policy this zero-tolerance policy needs to be amended well there's several pieces of legislation I know of that will address that that issue the question is whether the speaker will allow that kind of legislation to come to the floor of the house he has been very reluctant to allow various types of legislation to come where he thinks it might not you know where he thinks that he may be embarrassed in any way and so but but that's gonna be the key I think that we can get some of the legislation that's already out there that says you cannot do this then we can get there but at this point I think it's very difficult congressman do you have any sense of when we might be looking for director Muller's report and if your party were to take the house back in November to what extent do you think the likelihood of impeachment proceedings is first of all I did not have a clue as to when Muller will be issuing his report and I think that everybody needs to just chill for a minute and allow him to do his work mrs. I've never seen anything like this where defense team goes so publicly attacking a prosecutor I've never seen that and I practiced for practice over 20 years before I came to Congress so they have done everything they can to take away his credibility but I think we need to let him do his job and as far as impeachment is concerned I think we have to face that when we get to it a lot of it is gonna depend on what Muller comes back with all right congressman Elijah Cummings as always it's great to have you on the show it's great to see you in Washington sometime soon all right sir thank you thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more for morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
