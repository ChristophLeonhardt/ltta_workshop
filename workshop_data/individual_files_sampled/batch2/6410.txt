help me please have you seen this boy he was last seen at this podium screaming at these people until they made this face also missing Sarah Huckabee Sanders she was last seen with two very conflicting last names ever since Trump banned cameras and audio recordings for most press conferences my life has fallen apart at least was spicy I could look into the eyes of someone who was earnestly trying to make sense of it all but now it's just so much nothing the only statements I see from the White House are just the awkward moments Trump creates by being the worst like when he interrupted a phone call with the new Irish prime minister to hit on a reporter for her nice smile all right feel they need to wash things with like harsh chemicals at least he didn't like ask her to kiss his Blarney stones like makes them play on luck of the Irish which I guess would just be love the Irish the other day we needed Trump's thoughts on health care and CNN thought he was about to say something of substance so they cut to the White House to hear as Brooke Baldwin put it something very specific instead this was din Dan Gilbert just came in he's the best boy he's looking for the basketball player anybody played basketball let's go over to wisdom yoga what I don't who's Dan it's nobody find Dan at this time of day I used to see a canned statement from one of these two but instead the president proceeded to say literally the worst things to literally everyone in the room including Dan who it turns out owns the Cleveland Cavaliers and it's just incidentally hanging out around the White House follow with me as he needlessly brings up the Cubs bad season and your team's doing okay but you're gonna do great study now then suggest to Dan that he'd be better off with baseball players than basketball players on his basketball team come here Dan you wanna come over do you want a good baseball player to play basketball makes the Cubs rub it in Dan's face that LeBron James may leave the team next year ask him how is he doing with LeBron and as a bonus you tell me if he can remember this senators name senator one of the greats are you a fan you don't know who that guy is one of the best this guy's one of the best his name is he's a senator his name is it's senator it's a secret I'm keeping from you it's um this is my best friend senator Steve San Steve John Stephenson finally Trump gets to his official business and just to do a little official business health care is working along very well we could have a big surprise with a great health care package so your business is a surprise what are you a magician or like a hit man those are really the only two surprised based industries please bring spicy back why do you keep him from us is it just a with me because it's working I mean you broke CNN they started sending a courtroom sketch artist to the press briefings why do you do it is it because Spicer is getting better ratings I hope because the only other thing I can think of is not funny at all it's that after you finally said that there were no tapes of you talking to Comey you decided there should be no tapes of anything at all after all your main attack against the fake news press is that they're citing all these sources whose faces we don't see in statements we can't actually hear for ourselves why not turn these embarrassing moment factories into people whose faces we can't see and statements we can hear for ourselves so you can write everything off as fake news it's a great strategy for some other country not this one bring back spicy or at the very least send me a photo of him like holding a magazine so I know he's okay
