00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
A lot can be said about Rihanna and
Drake's hit song work. It completely

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:09,540
owned the charts in 2016. Its dance hall
beat and endless repetition were the

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,519
ultimate example of where the sound of
pop was going. It did everything most top

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:24,810
forties hits were doing - except for one
thing - it faded out. Let me start by

5
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,519
making a confession here, I used to hate
when songs faded out. it felt like a

6
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,010
cop-out. A lack of creativity. A boring
anti-ending to a song that I otherwise

7
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,440
really loved. It turns out that this is
the wrong opinion. The fade out

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,989
is misunderstood and under-appreciated.
There's an art to it. A science to it. And

9
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,670
when executed correctly, the fade out
makes a song feel like it'll live on

10
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,949
forever. This chart, which is pretty cool,
shows the number of songs that had a

11
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:02,820
fade out on the Billboard top 10 from
1946 to 2016. It was made by this guy. My

12
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,510
name is Bill Weir and I'm a writer -
mostly about music and specifically

13
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,549
about technology of music and history of
the music technology. So the chart starts

14
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:18,210
in 1946 but the story of the fade out
actually begins in 1918. Gustav Holtz was

15
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,590
conducting his world-famous piece "The
Planets" and he devised a unique way to

16
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,600
convey the distance of Neptune - at the
time the farthest known planet in the

17
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,009
solar system. So he wanted to create the
sense of almost unimaginable distance

18
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,900
and the mysteriousness of the cosmos. He
had the women's choir offstage in a room

19
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,460
and he instructed a stagehand
to slowly close the door to create the

20
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:50,529
effect of it fading out and going off
into the distance.

21
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,700
People loved that, it went over huge. I mean
today we take the fade out for granted,

22
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,710
but in 1918 it was like a whole
new whole new sonic adventure for them.

23
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,790
In the early days, the fade out was a
novelty. It was really only used to

24
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:09,068
convey real-world scenarios like
distance and space. That is until the

25
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:13,450
1950s and 60s when sound recording
wasn't just used to preserve a live

26
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,700
performance, it became its own art form.
The fade out quickly became a creative

27
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,140
and functional tool for record producers.
Functional, because radio deejays

28
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,730
demanded songs be three minutes or less.
If the album version was longer

29
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,319
producers would typically cut a shorter
radio-friendly version that faded during

30
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,290
the chorus. Fade outs were also used to
fix flubs here's the full waveform for

31
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,730
strawberry fields forever. You can see a
really long fade out and then it

32
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,410
suddenly starts coming back. George
Martin, the Beatles producer, wasn't crazy

33
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,980
about the percussion towards the end of
the song and so he faded the song out.

34
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,120
But then he hears all the great music
that happens after the fade-out that the

35
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,609
Beatles continued to play and he hated
to waste that so he faded back in.

36
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:13,469
Not only is there an art to the fade out,
there's a science to it also. Here Susan

37
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:18,239
Rogers. To do a fade properly you have to
do something called chasing the fade. So

38
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,420
we know from the Fletcher-Munson
curves that our ears don't perceive

39
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,370
frequencies of sound equally when played
at the same volume. if you've got the

40
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,420
speakers cranked you're hearing
approximately equal levels of bass

41
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,829
mid-range and high-end. But as soon as
you turn the level down, it becomes

42
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,459
really hard to hear the high highs and
the low lows, but you can hear the mid-range

43
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,090
very well. If you lowered everything
equally the singer would just be hanging

44
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:49,829
out there all by themselves. You can hear
that on Prince's "Slow Love" which Susan

45
00:03:49,829 --> 00:04:00,489
worked on.

46
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:06,950
The fade out became so ubiquitous that
by 1985 all top 10 songs of the year had

47
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,299
one. But there's something more to the
fade out than being another fashionable

48
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:15,680
trend in music. When psychologists
studied how different types of song

49
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,910
endings affected our experiences with
them, they found something pretty amazing.

50
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:25,400
The researchers, they had a group of
subjects listen to the same song but

51
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,150
two different versions, one with a
fade out one of the cold ending and they

52
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:34,370
had them tap along to the beat of each
version. If a song had a hard ending,

53
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,590
participants on average stopped tapping
along to the beat 1.04 seconds

54
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,570
before the end of the song. If it had a
fade out they'd stop tapping along to

55
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:49,699
the beat 1.40 seconds after
the song ended. In a sense that song was

56
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:57,139
living beyond its physical self in the
mind of the listener.

57
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:01,249
That might help explain why The Beatles
7-minute "Hey Jude" has a fade out that's

58
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:07,340
about as long as their entire early
singles. "Hey Jude" was released after The

59
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,590
Beatles stopped touring, they didn't need
to perform it live. Well until they did

60
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,300
this one TV performance. It's my pleasure
to introduce now in their first live

61
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,249
appearance for goodness knows how long
in front of an audience the Beatles. It

62
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:26,389
took at least 12 takes a lot of editing
and a visual fade to black to recreate

63
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:43,240
the same epic fade out of the recorded
version.

64
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,650
The fade out was such a long-lasting
record making tool, it was used in some

65
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:54,170
of the biggest hits for decades, but its
future isn't looking so great. Yeah I

66
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,180
mean it's kind of sad because the
fade out's

67
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,980
demise is kind of a replication of the
effect itself in that its actually

68
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:06,290
literally fading out in popular music,
and so slowly and gradually that I think

69
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,440
most people don't even notice. There are
plenty of songs over the last few years

70
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,640
that would have been better served with a
 fade out like Gotye's "Somebody that

71
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:20,930
I used to know" It just suddenly ends and
they they threw at Tom or something in

72
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:28,970
there they just went boom and it sounds
so pasted on to my ear. Bruno Mars'  "24k

73
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:34,010
magic" and "That's what I like" have abrupt
endings to when they sound like they

74
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,350
could fade out forever.

75
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,949
Pick any number of songs these days and
those pasted on endings are the norm.

76
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:51,039
Want to know what work sounds like with
a hard ending? It's terrible. The fade-out

77
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,530
it turns out, is important and often
necessary. It's a tool in a record

78
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,940
producers arsenal that makes us tap our
feet along even after our ears perceive

79
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,669
the very last notes. And I hope, just like
the ending of "Strawberry fields forever"

80
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:14,949
it comes back. It's hard to say whether
or not the fade-out will actually be as

81
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:21,190
prominent as it was 30 or 40 years ago I
just look at the Top 40 today and only three

82
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:28,180
songs had legitimate fade outs that I could find. could find.

83
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,900
Those three songs are
actually really good hint for the next earworm episode.

84
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,070
So go listen to the billboard top 40. Try to find those three songs.

85
00:07:36,070 --> 00:00:00,000
And let me
know what you think the next episode is gonna be about.
