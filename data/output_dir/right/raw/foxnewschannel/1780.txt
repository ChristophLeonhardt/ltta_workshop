IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING.

00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,575
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER

11
00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:21,710
DECLARING STATEHOOD IN 1948,

12
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,645
ISRAEL DESIGNATED THE CITY OF

13
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:27,382
JERUSALEM AS ITS CAPITAL.

14
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:30,352
THE CAPITAL, THE JEWISH PEOPLE

15
00:00:30,352 --> 00:00:32,320
ESTABLISHED IN ANCIENT TIMES.

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,488
SO IMPORTANT.

00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:36,992
ISRAEL'S GOVERNMENT.

00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:49,571
ISRAEL IS A SOVEREIGN NATION

24
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:50,972
WITH THE RIGHTS LIKE EVERY

25
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:52,240
OTHER SOVEREIGN NATION TO

26
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,775
DETERMINE ITS OWN CAPITAL.

27
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:57,145
YET FOR MANY YEARS WE FAILED TO

28
00:00:57,145 --> 00:00:59,247
ACKNOWLEDGE THE OBVIOUS, THE

29
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:01,850
PLAIN REALITY THAT ISRAEL'S

30
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,752
CAPITAL IS JERUSALEM.

THE UNITED STATES REMAINS FULLY

00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:39,221
