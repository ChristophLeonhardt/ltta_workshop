1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,589
the one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think matters the</font>

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,120
most in a relationship is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that both</font>

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,589
partners are committed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> making it work</font>

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,500
and both partners are caught in there

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,389
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> long haul if one partner is</font>

6
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:10,440
committed but the other one doesn't

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,200
really care or one partner is completely

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">different the odds of that relationship</font>

9
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,130
working in my mind are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of slim and</font>

10
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,990
I do feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if both partners are</font>

11
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,850
really committed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to making it work and</font>

12
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,990
that might mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing some things</font>

13
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,850
that are basic about themselves we're

14
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,289
really listening to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other person</font>

15
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,510
what the other person needs which might

16
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,130
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what they need</font>

17
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,500
that will in the end have the longest

18
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,899
impact on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship so if you</font>

19
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,399
give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> two people who really want to</font>

20
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,590
make their relationship work barring any

21
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,140
weird unforeseen circumstances like one

22
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,219
is gay and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there with somebody of the</font>

23
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,200
opposite sex but assuming that you've

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,390
got sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of two people who are basically</font>

25
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,829
compatible and really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

26
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,559
work you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it work might take</font>

27
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,289
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and effort and energy but that in</font>

28
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,489
my mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the ingredient for a</font>

29
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,170
long-term<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and now we make</font>

30
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,870
it work you can make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> great if both</font>

31
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,430
people are committed to making<font color="#E5E5E5"> great you</font>

32
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:00,000
can't make a relationship great
