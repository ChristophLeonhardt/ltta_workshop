MISSION OF AND THAT JUNGLE AND
HAS ONE SHOT TO SHOW HE IS
SERIOUS ABOUT RIDDING THE KOREAN
PENINSULA OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
>> THIS IS PROBABLY FAIRLY BEEN
DONE AND ITS UNKNOWN TERRITORY
IN A TRUE SENSE BUT I FEEL
CONFIDENT THAT I FEEL THAT KIM
JUNG-UN WANTS TO DO SOMETHING
GREAT FOR HIS PEOPLE AND HE HAS
THAT OPPORTUNITY AND HE WON'T
HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY AGAIN.
ED: HE ARRIVED HERE ABOUT FOUR
HOURS BEFORE THE PRESIDENT AND
SINGAPORE'S FOREIGN MINISTER
GREETING HIM AMONG THE TARMAC.
JOHN ROBERTS IS UP THEY LIVE.
GOOD AFTERNOON, JOHN.
WHAT IS THE LATEST?
REPORTER: ED, THE NEWS.
I THINK IT IS STILL MORNING HERE
IN SINGAPORE IN THE HOUR TIME
DIFFERENCE GETS YOU CONFUSED.
THE PRESIDENT AND HE ARRIVED
HERE LAST NIGHT AND BEFORE HE
HIM BARKED TO COME HERE TO
SINGAPORE DOWNPLAYING
EXPECTATIONS FOR WHAT CAN HAPPEN
IN ONE MEETING THAT CAN HAPPEN.
AT THE SAME TIME HE SENT A
STRONG MESSAGE TO KIM JONG-UN
STRONG MESSAGE TO KIM JONG-UN
THAT THIS IS YOUR ONE SHOT TO
GET THIS DONE.
THIS IS YOUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY AN
OPPORTUNITY THAT WILL NOT COME
AGAIN.
THE UNSPOKEN MESSAGE TO KIM
JONG-UN AND IS IF THIS THING
FALLS APART AND YOU GO BACK TO
PURSUING NUCLEAR WEAPONS IT WILL
NOT WORK OUT WELL FOR YOU.
SIXTY MINUTES TIME FROM NOW WHEN
IT IS AFTERNOON THE PRESIDENT
WILL MEET WITH THE SUMMIT HOST
AND HE'S THE PRIME MINISTER OF
SINGAPORE AND AFTER MEETING
THERE WITH KIM JUNG-UN YESTERDAY
YOU SEE THEM SHAKING HANDS
PLAYING DOWN THE POSSIBILITY OF
AN EYE HAPPEN IN THE FIRST
MEETING SAME AS WOULD BE QUOTE,
A LONG PROCESS.
THE PRESIDENT SAYS AT A MINIMUM
HE HOPES TO DEVELOP A
RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM JUNG-UN
AND GET THE PROCESS STARTED.
LISTEN HERE.
>> AS A DEAL PERSON I'VE DONE
WELL WITH DEALS.
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS START
THAT.
I LIKE TO ACCOMPLISH MORE THAN
THAT.
AT A MINIMUM I DO BELIEVE THAT
WE WILL HAVE MET EACH OTHER AND
SEEING EACH OTHER AND HOPEFULLY
HE WILL HAVE LIKED EACH OTHER
AND START THAT PROCESS.

AFTERNOON FOR THE PRESIDENT.
ED: ABSOLUTELY.
JOHN, IN THAT SOUNDBITE HE
ALERTED TO HIS BACKGROUND AS A
DEALMAKER AND THE FACT THAT HE
WANTS TO GO WITH HIS GUT HERE,
NOT JUST THE PREPARATION WITH
THE STAFF.
HOW THESE MEETINGS PLAY OUT IN
THE FORMAT AND HOW THAT WE PLAN
TO THE PRESIDENT INSTINCTS OR
NOT?

ONLY OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ROOM

AFTER THAT THEY WILL HAVE AN
EXPANDED LATERAL MEETING WHERE
CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN KELLY AS
WELL AS POMPEO AND JOHN BOLTON
WILL BE THERE.
THE PRESIDENT WANTS, AT A
MINIMUM , TOO GET FACE-TO-FACE
WITH KIM TO SAY LOOK, THIS IS
WHAT IS POSSIBLE.
MEMBER BACK IN NOVEMBER WHEN HE
GAVE THAT SPEECH BEFORE
PARLIAMENT IN SOUTH KOREA IN
SEOUL AND HE HELD OUT AN OLIVE
BRANCH SAYING THERE'S A BRIGHT
FUTURE AHEAD OF YOU IF YOU
CHOOSE A DIFFERENT PATH THAN THE
PURSUIT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
SOMETHING THAT IS INTERESTING TO
TAKE NOTE OF IS THAT THEY WILL
BE MEETING AT THE RESORT IS A
FUN ISLAND OF SINGAPORE AND THAT
IS WHERE THE UNIVERSAL STUDIOS
THE PARK IS AND THERE ARE THREE
ROLLER COASTERS OVER THERE.
I'M THINKING A PHOTO OP, WHAT
YOU THINK?
ED: THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE RIGHT
IMAGE OF A ROLLER COASTER RIDE
