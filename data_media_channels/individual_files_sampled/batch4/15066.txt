Doug Ford has been wasting no time as Ontario's new premier he's making decisive decisions about the most important subjects carbon tax cap-and-trade hydro one but I think he's tackled the most controversial subject of all and he did so quickly and decisively namely scrapping the child sex curriculum that hyper-sexualized children of tender years he just scrapped it and reverted to the last version of the sex ed while he engages in a review no fuss no muss he just did it and joining us now in studio to talk about this is the woman perhaps most responsible for this bold policy decision I'm talking about Tanya Granick Allen she's with parents as first educators the president's a pleasure to have you back in the studio it's great to be here I have to say this was a tough one because the media and the establishment is so unanimous that this is the test are you a modern political person or not and Doug for just sort of said boom we're done it no fuss no muss no wishy-washy no flip flopper ii and and it's done it's done already it's amazing this was a great issue because you actually did not require to pass legislation it's simple directive from the Minister it's done and and and to have that full repeal though I should I should mention that there needs to be a directive sent to the teacher saying that no component of the wind' sex ed should be discussed further for example the unscientific gender identity theory that should not be mentioned and that should may be made very clear and also I know they're reverting to the previous version there must always be an opt-out for parents so advance notification and seeing through the repeal by always giving parents an opt-out because let's face us you'll never satisfy every parent and every parent must have their rights respected and that must be paramount those are excellent details that ought to be added and I agree with you that they're important but the center that that this and you know what and I think it gave people the creeps that Ben Levin who was later convicted of of trying to recruit young chilled to to molest them that such a person a pedophile would have been the deputy minister at the time this curriculum was developed when he was convicted I think a lot of people said how can you possibly allow a curriculum and I know he personally didn't write it but he oversaw the ministry for abortion that time well everything that came through his office he signed off on and so he was in part developing the curriculum but of course I'm with UserA it's a massive red flag who wants their children learning a sex ed curriculum from a convicted child pornographers it's absurd yeah I mean we followed that trial in that conviction very closely he I even hate to mention the details because there's so summing stomach-turning he even chatted online with someone saying he would like to molest his own grandchildren I know that's so shocking is saying I'm sorry to say and engrossed our people out but when someone like that is in charge of the curriculum how can you how can you go with that into the schools it's fruit from a poison tree and it's shocking to me that it took an election to get that ripped out well it's true and you know people say well are you for updating the curriculum us sure certainly I am and I will agree with the former Premier Kathleen Wynne that yeah updates need to happen and with modern technology things like sexting and whatnot need to be covered strange though that well I guess I'll concede that it needs to be updated she never once mentioned pornography in the curriculum you mentioned Ben Levin again convicted child pornographer yeah makes you wonder why yeah it's it's really straightened and we were just talking before we turn the cameras on if there are some parents out there who really want to teach their children of tender years I'm talking about six-year-olds here about the six genders or or some of the more extreme stuff I suppose they can do that so this isn't stopping any parent who really loved the ban leaven curriculum god forbid it's just freeing the other nineteen ninety five ninety nine percent of parents from being bound by it it just seems so common sense let me ask you though what has been the public reaction I know the usual suspects in the media leads are freaking out but what's the reaction being I mean you're you're the president of a parent Orianthi group what's the reaction from severely normal Ontarians it's overwhelmingly positive in fact I mean think back to when they introduced the curriculum did you see people protesting for classes on anal and oral sex or masturbation on Queens Park I didn't I stopped parents freezing their butts off in the middle of winter saying by the thousands saying hey no this is irresponsible and sexualizes our kids but since the leadership and since this issue was thrust into the leadership and now we have the repeal hopefully fully by the end of the week we see that parents are saying hey we know there's a problem with this curriculum we hear a lot about the problems of this curriculum we're not sure exactly what but there's an issue I need to open up the books of my kids and ask them what are you learning in school and I think a lot of parents also had a lot of they were alerted to the problems within this curriculum when kids would come home from school and they'd be discussing things around the dinner table that parents would never imagine they would have oh you're so right I mean I read through the Ben Levin curriculum very carefully and some of those subjects in my view and I don't think I'm a prude at all if you're not a grown adult if you know I mean if I call it that's like college level maturity and for for young kid that was my chief beef with this is it push sexuality to people who to young kids who should be allowed to have a childhood or they're not being forced to think and talk and grapple with issues that they're just they're supposed to have a childhood that that's what was so urgent to me not even what was being taught but how early why are you talking to I'm not gonna say babies but these are people were playing with dolls and not anatomically correct doll so what do you doing well again gender identity was introduced as a topic to eight-year-olds do you know how many genders there are I think we're up to 112 now yeah so that's concerning most adults are confused by it and and let's let's be let's be clear here this is unscientific I'm probably part of the majority that believes children should be taught facts and in scientific based things in school well of theories that are unproven well and the left always says oh you're just to prove this is science you know that I challenge anyone who's watching this without googling it to name the six official genders that that the Ben Levin sex curriculum had any of thankfully what we're talking about now it is now history Doug Ford I'm impressed by the fact that he tackled this substantive issue but I got to tell you it gives me encouragement about him as a premier on 20 different issues because now I know that when it comes to an issue that the media is unanimous about over here and the people are almost unanimous about over here he won't he won't bend to the peer pressure in the media that's the rarest thing in a politician isn't it well with I have to just say one thing though when it came to my candidacy that was not the case yes so while I I'm happy to see that he is keeping most of his promises there he did break his promise to me and again as to why you'd have to ask him because I have not heard well I'm glad you brought it up I didn't want to emphasize that because the news of the day is the sex child sex curriculum has been repealed that's great news you're right that that was a big beef for us here at the rebel because in so many ways you were the kingmaker it was your campaign that put Doug Ford over the top for his leadership and I found his firing of you as a candidate or maybe you I don't know how it actually went down I found that demoralizing and I thought this reminds me of Patrick Brown but I think I think now that he crossed the finish line he's stronger I had I don't want to ask you to reveal confidences but are you at liberty to tell our viewers have you been in touch with Doug Ford personally or his staff since you were displaced as a candidate so his not choosing not to recognize me as the democratically nominate a candidate in mississauga center that happened May 5th and I reached out to Doug that day and I he did not return my call or text I did hear from his campaign manager Corey tonight who gave me the information and I have not heard from him since so any particulars of that day I suggest you invite Doug on and ask him yourself I was more interested if you've had a rat proche model or a reconciliation or any more interaction so basically when you Reese act as the candidate that was in a well my phone is always and I hope if if he wants to reach out to me I'm happy to take his calls well I'm glad to hear that I have to say you're a good sport and you're remarkably positive given that you earned and you were not handed that nomination you had to fight for it it was women it was very stress I told Doug this when he after when he called to congratulate me on winning the nomination I said Doug I will do 10 leadership's before doing another one of them that was stressful yeah and but you know it was a wonderful experience I met so many wonderful people from such a diverse community and faith backgrounds who really really stood unified with me on this issue of repealing the sex ed and on religious liberty and freedom of speech well I hope that you can become a part of the government in some way because I think you represent a group of Ontarians I don't know what percentage it is you have an expertise in the issue of representing parents you obviously helped put them over the top your focus on this issue I think is you and there's a few others who properly get credit for this change I hope that you are incorporated in the government in some way but tell me what you need your back is president of parents as first educators what what is that is that a part time that's obvious a part time NGO that you run it is it represents over eighty thousand supporters of an Ontario grandparents aunts uncles parents but I am a mother for young children I married happily and but even pretty busy I'm a very busy woman look I got into the leadership for for one for many issues but to be an advocate for the grassroots for free speech for religious liberty and for the repealing of the sex ed and and and what not so I was always in this for the issues so I never intended to run for politics I only did so at the behest of Doug and his team I followed through and and then things happened but I will always be in there to advocate for the issues and in my role as parents as first educators as president is to advocate for the parents and the children of Ontario well I got to tell you you handled that unfair defenestration a lot friendlier than I would have done you've been a lot more positive I mean I think what happened to you was atrocious frankly and I said so at the time but you held your tongue and you were positive when you were focused on the prize which was getting that curriculum thrown out mission accomplished so credit to you for biting your tongue and being a team player in a way that many others wouldn't I hope that you will have successes in the future we will cover what you do will cover your projects we think you have an important voice that's proved you in many ways helped shape Ontario today whether it's Doug for its own success or this curriculum so I'd like to say on behalf of our viewers we think that you are an important part of the public policy conversation and whatever you do in the weeks and months ahead keep us posted because we think you're a positive force in this problem Thank You Ezra and to all your supporters and viewers who have either personally sent positive messages or I know who quietly supported you know the parental rights and and just freedom in general yeah well I'm hopeful that a little bit of use rubbed off on Doug I mean I think he's a good egg to begin with I think he's got a good heart he reminds me of his brother in a lot of ways who had a big heart I think he's going to be good for the province I think you got to stay on him a little bit though I think we all do because we have because let me put it this way you got a thousand journalists and other elites pulling him this way everyone who can should help pull them that way so at least he can walk straight well and they're also you know sex ed is one issue I mean we have to talk about bill 89 at some point where children are being removed from their homes if their parents don't subscribe to gender theory and if their child want to change sex and they don't they don't get them hormone therapy or or surgery this child will be removed because that's considered abuse I said so by the by the minister under Kathleen Wynne's government so that that has to be fixed yeah well let's talk about that I mean I don't want to jump in right now that's such a big topic let's have you back on another day to talk about that in depth and then there's even the federal c16 the Jordan Peterson first brought to light there's so much to talk about the battle never ends because the other side never rests but Tanya it's great to see you again thanks for coming by our studio congratulations on the effect you've had I have to say you have had had you've had more packed on Ontario's trajectory perhaps than anyone else other than Doug Ford himself so congratulations well thank you and thanks to the parents this was a parent's effort so it's a victory for parents well great to see you again there you have it I admit I'm a bit of a fanboy I think tani has done some great work and I just said so about four times but it's the truth don't you think that's
