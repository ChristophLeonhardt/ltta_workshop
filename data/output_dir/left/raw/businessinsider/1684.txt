1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,429
so we had this hint from CERN from the

2
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,019
Large Hadron Collider this wonderful

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,870
particle accelerator under the ground

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,800
between the border<font color="#CCCCCC"> of France and</font>

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,720
Switzerland the same place that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font>

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">years ago discovered the Higgs boson</font>

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,650
finally and the Higgs<font color="#CCCCCC"> boson was the</font>

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,660
final piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Standard Model of</font>

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,039
particle physics it was the final

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,720
particle that we really really thought

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,820
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be there but of course most</font>

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,349
physicists want to find the next

13
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,000
particle we want to find the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font>

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,430
we had not predicted<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be there so</font>

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,380
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible we might have done that</font>

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,420
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit of a hint it is not</font>

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,520
settled yet it's sort of maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,020
there maybe it's not but it's looking

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,239
more and more likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to declare a new</font>

20
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,399
particle much heavier<font color="#CCCCCC"> than the Higgs</font>

21
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,559
boson<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Higgs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a little bit over a</font>

22
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,539
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> times as massive as a proton</font>

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,149
this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 800 times as</font>

24
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,239
massive as a proton what it is nobody

25
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,160
has any ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's full employment for</font>

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,510
theoretical physicists they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

27
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down equations right down</font>

28
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,049
models that would predict what kind of

29
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">particle would have these properties all</font>

30
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,820
you see is like a few extra events of a

31
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,159
certain kind in a certain part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

32
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,080
detector and you compare<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to what</font>

33
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,880
you see elsewhere and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try to fit it</font>

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,950
into some bigger model that makes sense

35
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,460
but hopefully fingers crossed this is

36
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,799
the first step to opening a whole new

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,780
window on particles that we hadn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font>

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:00:00,000
imagined
