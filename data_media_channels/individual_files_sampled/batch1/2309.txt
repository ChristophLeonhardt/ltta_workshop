my mom and I have always kind of disagreed about politics just this past election kind of highlighted some sort of underlying issues that have always been there but it just brought it to the forefront I irritate her in every way now after this election every single thing well how would you describe you Nevada's relationship right now very tense I'm very hurt by being cut off it's very very painful having separation Trump's election revealed a stark division in the United States a division that goes beyond politics one that impacts friends and families we wanted to talk to a family going through this awkward divide together so I posted this note on Facebook asking people to reach out if their family had been divided by political differences out of all the responses I got one story stood out in particular it was from a woman named Rebecca a married mother of two who lives in Montgomery Alabama she also happened to be a classmate of mine at the University of Alabama way back when Rebecca responded to real I have stopped talking to my mom because of trunk not that he is the only problem but more so representative of a lot of problems already they're not sure what you're looking for but yeah his election has certainly been divisive however Rebecca didn't think her mom would be willing to reunite to discuss their differences on camera but almost a month after Rebecca's first message her mom Mary agreed to sit down for an interview Rebecca came with me to Mary's home and they sat down together to talk about how they could begin to move forward Mary lives in Matthews Alabama about 20 miles away from her daughter so guys like keep it peaceful you know I know that there's so I will just get my room we don't do anything violent towards each other it's just as a Christian I'm taught to love and forgive and unfortunately I'm afraid from what I've seen the Democratic Party if you don't march lockstep they're going to turn their back on you were you ever a Democrat I I was independent I never um I can't remember whether yes I did those Democrat I was very sorry I did it afterwards it was Jimmy Carter generationally speaking I think there is somewhat of a divide that I think is part of our issue because the world you grew up in it's not the world I grew up in destroyed and and so I think it's difficult for you to understand some of the ways that I see things because you know when you were younger and even as you raised me I think there was less diversity I think my generation has a different idea of what we want things to look like I was born in South Korea adopted when I was four months old so my family's white some of my frustrations is that yes I'm a minority and so some of the things that I've had to deal with growing up my mom doesn't her shame and can't understand me she doesn't have a framework to understand that I was born again after I married my husband and so I became very strong in the face one of the Trump things was that the freedom and protection of religion and he has since done an executive order or some kind of order that reinforces that so he's kept his promise and I'm thrilled about that I know he said very many objectionable things and I found him objectionable and deplorable Hillary was downright evil we had two very poor choices this time and I think he's done a wonderful job since he's been in in terms of media is he literally only watches Fox News I don't think there's a single group that wasn't in some way attacks or marginalize or threatened in some way this past election and you know as a minority as a woman that's the immigrant as a mother all those things are things that I care about very much because it does impact me directly I would love for my mom to be more involved in what I do and my kids and everything but that part for me when there's a seeming unwillingness to to change that perspective or maybe broaden it a little bit even if she doesn't want to see me I want to be able to hold them and have a relationship with them frankly one of the things we've talked about is getting some kind of therapist or counselor or somebody who can talk to both of us in a way that that can provide some objectivity into our you know disagreements so that we can even if we don't agree we can agree to disagree you know even if we don't you know aren't a picturesque kind of version of a family that at least we can get together and have a pleasant time you know now and then I can that that's a reasonable expectation that we get pen listed it's very hard was feeling of separation once the camera was turned off Mary and Rebecca hugged each other we checked in with Rebecca a couple of months later she said that since the interview she and Mary are talking more often
