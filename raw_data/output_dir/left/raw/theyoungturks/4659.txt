1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,850
MARTIN SHKRELI, THE INFAMOUS
PHARMA BRO, IS ABOUT TO STAND

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,190
TRIAL, AND OF COURSE THE FIRST
PART OF THE TRIAL IS JURY

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,189
SELECTION.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,010
HOWEVER, THEY ARE HAVING A
REALLY HARD TIME FINDING

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,360
THE RIGHT JURORS, BECAUSE
PEOPLE AREN'T CURRENTLY BIASED

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,360
AGAINST HIM.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,600
IN FACT, PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM, SEE HIS

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,650
FACE AND THINK THAT HE LOOKS
LIKE A CROOK, AND THAT THEY

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:30,310
CANNOT GET PAST THAT IN ORDER TO
RULE IN AN UNBIASED FASHION.

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,839
TO GIVE YOU THE DETAILS; MORE
THAN 120 POTENTIAL JURORS WERE

11
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:38,449
DISMISSED MONDAY FROM THE
FEDERAL COURT TRIAL IN BROOKLYN,

12
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:42,059
WHERE HE FACES EIGHT COUNTS OF
SECURITIES AND WIRE FRAUD

13
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,980
RELATED TO HIS TWO HEDGE FUNDS,
AND HIS DRUG COMPANY.

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,729
THIS ISN'T EVEN RELATED TO HIS
DRUG COMPANY THAT HE HAD, KNOWN

15
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:56,659
AS TOURING PHARMACEUTICALS,
WHERE HE SAID THAT FAMOUS DRUG

16
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:02,891
PRICE HIKE, FROM THREE DOLLARS
FOR DESCENT RATE FELL TO $750 A

17
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:07,719
PILL, SO HE IS A BAD DUDE.

18
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,210
WHEN THE POTENTIAL JURORS WERE
QUESTIONED ABOUT HIM, HERE ARE

19
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,509
SOME OF THE QUOTES, OR
STATEMENTS THAT THEY MADE:

20
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,409
ONE JUROR SAID, "THIS IS THE
PRICE GOUGE OR OF DRUGS.

21
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:20,250
MY KIDS ARE ON SOME OF THESE
DRUGS.

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,240
THIS IMPACTS MY KIDS."

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
GONE.

24
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
GONE.

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,659
I LIKE THE JURY SYSTEM, I KNOW
THAT IT'S NOT OFTEN TIMES

26
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,590
POPULAR OPINION, BUT I LIKE
FACING A JURY OF MY PEERS,

27
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,100
BUT IT'S KIND OF A WEIRD
SITUATION WHERE, IF YOU ARE

28
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,500
PERSONALLY AFFECTED BY THIS, AND
HENCE UNDERSTAND IT BETTER

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,420
THAN ANYONE ELSE, YOU ARE NOT
ALLOWED ON THE JURY.

30
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,649
THEY CONSIDER IT BIAS.

31
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:46,799
I WOULD CONSIDER IT A VERY
LEGITIMATE PERSPECTIVE, BUT

32
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,590
THOSE GUYS ARE GONE.

33
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,680
LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW OTHER
EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WHO WILL

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,970
NOT BE ON THE JURY.

35
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,180
MANY JURORS SEEM TO SEE SHKRELI
AS THE FACE OF CORPORATE GREED

36
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,219
IN AMERICA, THAT IS WHAT ONE
INDIVIDUAL SAID.

37
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:02,229
ANOTHER SAID, "I THINK HE'S A
VERY EVIL MAN.

38
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:03,840
I DON'T THINK I CAN BE FAIR.

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,799
MY OPINION IS PRE-WELL-INFORMED,
I WOULDN'T WANT TO SERVE ON THIS

40
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,799
JURY."

41
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:09,799
HE'S SAYING THAT HIS OPINION IS
FORMED.

42
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:10,799
I'M SORRY, FORMED.

43
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:19,330
I WOULD RELEASE HIM, ONE DUDE
THINKS HE IS EVIL BEFORE

44
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,130
THE TRIAL EVEN STARTS.

45
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,060
NOT EVERYONE WHO WAS A POTENTIAL
JUROR NEW WHO HE WAS, THEY

46
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,980
DON'T NECESSARILY FOLLOW THE
NEWS, BUT THEY SEEM ñ

47
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,780
BUT THEY SEEM TO HAVE A BIAS
AGAINST HIM BASED ON FACE ALONE,

48
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,200
AND THAT WAS A PRETTY CREDIBLE
COMPONENTS TO THIS STORY.

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,420
SO, ONE PERSON DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS STORY

50
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,560
SAID, "I LOOKED RIGHT AT HIM,
AND IN MY SAID THAT'S IN MY

51
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,970
HEAD I SAID, THAT'S A SNAKE ñ
NOT KNOWING WHO HE WAS."

52
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,629
SOME MIGHT SAY, ISN'T THAT A
LITTLE UNFAIR?

53
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:50,510
BUT HE CAN'T EVEN TAKE A SINGLE
PICTURE WITHOUT LOOKING LIKE A

54
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,730
SMUG PRICK.

55
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,030
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, LET'S
GO TO GRAPHIC 9.

56
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,769
LET'S GO TO GRAPHIC 10.

57
00:02:57,769 --> 00:02:59,349
HE JUST ALWAYS HAS THIS ñ

58
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:01,209
YEAH, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE
THAT FACE.

59
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:03,549
LOOK AT THAT FACE, WHY DOES HE
MAKE THAT BASE?

60
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:06,760
IT'S LIKE HE WANTS PEOPLE TO
HATE HIM.

61
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,920
IT'S NOT THE CONTOURS OF HIS
FACE, IT'S THE LOOK THAT HE

62
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,810
CONSTANTLY HAS, LIKE HA HA, I'M
SCREWING YOU SOMEHOW.

63
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,220
IT'S THE EXPRESSION.

64
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,909
YEAH, AND THEN MY FAVORITE QUOTE
ñ

65
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:19,770
AGAIN, THIS WAS A PERSON WHO DID
NOT KNOW WHAT ABOUT HIM PRIOR TO

66
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:26,750
JURY SELECTION ñ ONE MAN SAID,
"HE KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A DICK."

67
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,019
HE WAS LET ONTO THE JURY
BECAUSE THE JUDGE FOUND THAT

68
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:30,420
STATEMENT TO BE ACCURATE.

69
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,549
NO, HE WASN'T.

70
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:38,159
SHKRELI MIGHT HAVE A TOUGH
TIME IN THIS CASE, PARTLY

71
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,330
BECAUSE HE IS WRONG.

72
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,340
I TOLD YOU, I BELIEVE IN THE
JURY SYSTEM, THEY CAN SENSE

73
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,870
THAT THIS GUY IS WHO HE ACTUALLY
IS.

74
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,020
YEAH, LOOK, WE OBVIOUSLY COVERED
HIM, AND WE KNOW THAT HE IS

75
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,670
NOT A GREAT PERSON; HOWEVER, I
THINK EVERYONE, REGARDLESS

76
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,530
OF WHO THEY ARE, DESERVES A
FAIR TRIAL, AND SO I DO HOPE

77
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,969
THAT THEY FIND JURORS WHO ARE
NOT IMMEDIATELY BIASED

78
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,909
AGAINST HIM, AND I HOPE JUSTICE
IS SERVED.

79
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:07,379
THAT'S MY TAKE ON IT.

80
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,620
IF YOU SAY SO.

81
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,170
NO, OF COURSE!

82
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,480
OF COURSE.

83
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,810
I KNOW SHKRELI MIGHT BE A UNIQUE
CASE, BUT OVERALL DON'T MAKE

84
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,579
JUDGMENTS ABOUT PEOPLE BASED ON
THEIR FACE.

85
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:27,350
BELIEVE ME, YOU WILL HAVE 20 OF
EVIDENCE 

86
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:40,980
TO DECIDE THAT HE IS A

87
00:04:40,980 --> 00:00:00,000
DICK ANYWAY.
