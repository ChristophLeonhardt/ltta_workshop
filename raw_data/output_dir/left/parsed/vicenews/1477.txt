so let's start at the beginning when you
announced your candidacy in Springfield
you said Washington must change you
talked about building consensus ending
petty politics so two terms later where
are we well that didn't work out did it
I you know I could not be prouder of the
work that my administration's done but
there is no doubt that one of the
central goals that I had had which was
to make the politics in Washington work
better to reduce the knee-jerk
partisanship to elevate the debate I
haven't accomplished that
