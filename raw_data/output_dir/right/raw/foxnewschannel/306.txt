KIM JONG-UN REPORTEDLY ASKING

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,809
THE POPE TO VISIT HIS COUNTRY.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,677
THAT'S ACCORDING TO SOUTH KOREA.

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:12,612
THE INVITATION ANNOUNCED ON THE

6
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,480

BY SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE

8
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,049
POMPEO SUNDAY.

9
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,385
HE SAYS THE SECOND SUMMIT WITH

10
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:20,553
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM IS

11
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:23,155
CLOSE TO A DONE DEAL.

12
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,258
SENATOR CORY GARDNER IS THE

13
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:26,392
MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS

14
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,827
COMMITTEE AND JOINS US NOW.

15
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,462
FIRST OF ALL, THE POPE TO NORTH

16
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:29,762
KOREA?

17
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,564
IS THAT A LIKELY SCENARIO?

18
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,199
>> I CERTAINLY THINK THE POPE

19
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,367
WILL CONSIDER THIS VERY

20
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,134
CAREFULLY BEFORE HE MAKES ANY

21
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,736
DECISION TO DO THIS.

22
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,237
CLEARLY KIM JONG-UN HAS A LOT

23
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,706
TO ASK FOR FORGIVENESS.

24
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,641
THE ASSASSINATION OF HIS

25
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:42,808
STEPBROTHER, THE BLOWING AWAY

26
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,411
OF HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW I BELIEVE

27
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,014
IT WAS WITH AN ANTI-AIRCRAFT

28
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:48,814
GUN BASICALLY IMPRISONMENT OF

29
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,117
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN NORTH

30
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:54,120
KOREA, STARVING HIS OWN PEOPLE

31
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,454
FOR HIS OWN ENRICHMENT.

32
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,056
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THIS

33
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,558
GUY HAS DONE THAT PERHAPS A

34
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,426
CONVERSATION WITH THE POPE

35
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,594
WOULD BE A LITTLE REDEEMING.

36
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,829
>> Sandra: WE'RE FINDING THIS

37
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,065
OUT THROUGH A STATEMENT FROM

38
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:06,532
SOUTH KOREA.

39
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,434
NORTH KOREA, YOU KNOW, PUTTING

40
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,770
THIS MESSAGE THROUGH THE SOUTH

41
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,705
AND CHAIRMAN KIM APPARENTLY

42
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,174
TOLD SOUTH KOREA'S MOON THE

43
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,810
POPE WOULD BE ENTHUSIASTICALLY

44
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,678
WELCOMED IN NORTH KOREA.

45
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:19,845
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE

46
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,714
MOTIVATION IS THERE?

47
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,582
>> IT'S KIM JONG-UN TRYING TO

48
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,784
FLATTER THE WORLD, SHOW THE

49
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,652
WORLD HE CAN BRING IN BIG

50
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:27,253
NAMES, BIG PEOPLE.

51
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,988
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

52
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,623
STATES, THE SECRETARY OF STATE

53
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,258
AND THE POPE FOR PETE SAKE

54
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,160
TRYING TO SHOW THEY'RE A

55
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:34,627
RATIONAL ACTOR.

56
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:44,637
BUT THEY ARE NOT AND WILL NOT

57
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,973
BE CONSIDERED A RATIONAL ACTOR

58
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,575
UNTIL THEY DENUCLEARIZE.

59
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,344
THERE IS NO LEGITIMIZATION THAT

60
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,579
WILL OCCUR OF NORTH KOREA.

61
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,380
FOLLOW THE LAW, INTERNATIONAL

62
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,514
LAW AND THE RULE OF LAW AND

63
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,849
MAYBE THEY CAN HAVE ALL THE

64
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,783
VISITS THEY WANT.

65
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,418
>> Sandra: ALL THIS COMING ON

66
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:03,622
THE HEELS OF WHAT MIKE POMPEO

67
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,291
IS DESCRIBING AS A VERY

68
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,192
PRODUCTIVE MEETING WITH NORTH

69
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:06,892
KOREA, WATCH.

70
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:12,365
>> WE HAD A GOOD, PRODUCTIVE

71
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,232
CONVERSATION.

72
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,168
[INAUDIBLE]

73
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,472
>> Sandra: WE HAD A GOOD,

74
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,574
PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION, HE

75
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:22,975
DESCRIBED THIS AS SIGNIFICANT

76
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,544
PROGRESS WHAT WE'RE SEEING TO

77
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,213
DATE IN A LONG PROCESS.

78
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,681
SO SENATOR, HOW WOULD YOU

79
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,049
CHARACTERIZE THE PROGRESS THAT

80
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,884
WE'RE MAKING WITH NORTH KOREA

81
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,119
TODAY?

82
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,286
>> THERE WAS SOME SENSE EARLY

83
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,089
ON WE WOULD HAVE A SUCCEED

84
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,659
FAST/FAIL FAST STRATEGY.

85
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,827
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW

86
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,929
IS THE RECOGNITION IT WILL BE A

87
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,630
LONG HAUL.

88
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,831
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, WE

89
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,999
CANNOT LET UP OUR PRESSURE.

90
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,503
WE HAVE TO CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS

91
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,670
ON MAXIMUM PRESSURE, CONTINUE

92
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,339
OUR SANCTIONS AND CONTINUE TO

93
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,707
PUNISH THOSE VIOLATING THE

94
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,575
SANCTIONS AS IT RELATES TO

95
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,711
NORTH KOREA, CHINA, RUSSIA, OR

96
00:02:58,712 --> 00:02:59,712
INDIVIDUAL ACTORS IN NORTH

97
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,514
KOREA OR AROUND THE GLOBE.

98
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,915
THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE A

99
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,850
VERY GOOD JOB OPENING THE

100
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,918
CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION THAT

101
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,420
PREVIOUSLY WERE SHUT DOWN BUT I

102
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,054
WANT TO MAKE SURE IT ISN'T MORE

103
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:09,989
OF THE SAME.

104
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,390
WE AREN'T GOING BACK OVER 40

105
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,460
YEARS OF RERUNS HERE SO WE CAN

106
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,561
GET EVERYBODY EXCITED AND

107
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,062
ENTHUSED ABOUT WHAT NORTH KOREA

108
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:20,566
TO DO TO THEN PULL THE RUG OUT

109
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,235
UNDERNEATH AND RESULT IN NO

110
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:23,936
DENUCLEARIZATION.

111
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,671
>> Sandra: THE "WALL STREET

112
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,440
JOURNAL" BOARD WHO HAS BEEN

113
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,941
CRITICAL THROUGH THE PROCESS

114
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:29,875
AND THE CHARACTERIZATION OF

115
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,510
PROGRESS BEING MADE THERE BACKS

116
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,945
UP WHAT MIKE POMPEO SAID AFTER

117
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,714
THIS MEETING WITH NORTH KOREA

118
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,817
ON SUNDAY WRITING NORTH KOREA'S

119
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:41,320
BABY STEPS, THE BEST ARGUMENT

120
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,655
FOR MR. POMPEO'S OPTIMISM

121
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,390
AMOUNTS TO CONFIDENCE BUILDING

122
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:48,594
MAKE THE NORTH FEEL COMFORTABLE

123
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,762
WITH NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT.

124
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:53,365
THAT IT'S BEING DONE ON THE

125
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,000
NORTH'S SLOW TIMETABLE AND THE

126
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:55,701
NORTH HAS THE DIPLOMATIC

127
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,202
ADVANTAGE.

128
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:58,737
>> I THINK THE NORTH

129
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,472
UNDERSTANDS VERY WELL THEY'RE

130
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,774
LOOKING AT A UNITED STATES

131
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,409
ELECTION CYCLE COMING UP IN 30

132
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,313
DAYS IN THE U.S., TWO YEARS FOR

133
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,013
THE PRESIDENT.

134
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,049
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT PERHAPS

135
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,116
THE DIPLOMATIC ENVIRONMENT

136
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,051
CHANGES AFTER ELECTIONS.

137
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,919
WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY WAIT FOR

138
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,753
THE NEXT PRESIDENT, WHETHER

139
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,421
IT'S PRESIDENT TRUMP OR

140
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,789
SOMEBODY ELSE?

141
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,823
I THINK THEY'RE CLEVER WHAT

142
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:18,891
THEY'RE TRYING TO DO.

143
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,292
THEY'LL TAKE A LONG TIME.

144
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,727
TIME WORKS TO THEIR ADVANTAGE

145
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,194
AND BENEFIT.

146
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,829
ARE THEY ABLE TO BREAK OFF OUR

147
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,165
ALL AISLES IN THE MEANTIME?

148
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,800
WHAT CAN THEY DO TO DRIVE A

149
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:28,734
WEDGE BETWEEN SOUTH KOREA AND

150
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,568
THE UNITED STATES?

151
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,503
WILL THEY CONVINCE THE

152
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:31,804
PRESIDENT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT

153
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,506
TROOPS IN SOUTH KOREA, WHICH I

154
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,074
THINK THE REMOVAL OF WOULD BE A

155
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:35,641
VERY BAD IDEA.

156
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,976
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE

157
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:37,743
TRYING TO DO.

158
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:38,878
THESE ARE SAVVY OPERATORS.

159
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,946
FOR PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT IT WAS

160
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,348
JUST A BACKWARDS NATION, I

161
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,216
THINK ONE THING THEY DIDN'T

162
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,085
REALIZE THEY'VE BEEN VERY

163
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,920
CLEVER PARTICIPANTS IN THIS

164
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,121
DIPLOMATIC GAME FOR DECADES AND

165
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,990
KIM JONG-UN SEEMS TO HAVE

166
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,258
PICKED UP THAT CLEVERNESS FROM

167
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,494
HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER.

168
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,129
>> Sandra: OF COURSE WORD NOW

169
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,231
THAT KIM JONG-UN IS READY TO

170
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,368
INVITE INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS IN

171
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:05,804
TO INSPECT THIS NUCLEAR TEST

172
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,138
SITE.

173
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,574
THEY HAD JOURNALISTS WATCH IT

174
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,242
BACK IN MAY BUT EXPERTS SAYING

175
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,644
IT'S THE RANGE OF INSPECTION

176
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,045
THAT IS GOING TO COUNT HERE.

177
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:13,612
>> RIGHT.

178
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,314
IT IS THE RANGE, THE LOCATION

179
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,882
AND ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE

180
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,618
TO TEST THE SOIL AND GO INTO

181
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:20,319
FACILITIES BEYOND THIS?

182
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,820
WILL THEY HAVE A FULL

183
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,622
DISCLOSURE OF THE FACILITIES?

184
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,257
UNFETTERED ACCESS OF ALL OF

185
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,625
THESE FACILITIES AROUND THE

186
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:26,959
COUNTRY?

187
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,761
THIS ISN'T JUST A ONE SITE

188
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:29,595
LOCATION WHERE THE NUCLEAR

189
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:32,264
TESTS WERE TAKING PLACE.
