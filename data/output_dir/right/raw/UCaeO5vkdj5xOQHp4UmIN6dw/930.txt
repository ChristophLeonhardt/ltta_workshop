1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,777
- And this is one thing that
does bother me on both sides,

2
00:00:01,777 --> 00:00:03,992
is the sort of tokenism
that adheres to both sides.

3
00:00:03,992 --> 00:00:05,634
So on the one side
you'll see from the left

4
00:00:05,634 --> 00:00:07,603
this idea that if you are
gay then you cannot - Yeah.

5
00:00:07,603 --> 00:00:09,282
be conservative or as
you saw with Kanye West

6
00:00:09,282 --> 00:00:11,063
if you're legitimately black or you care

7
00:00:11,063 --> 00:00:13,111
about black folks then you
can't actually be a fan

8
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:15,240
of President Trump, you can't
be an independent thinker

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,876
in any way and then I do
think that there are some

10
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:19,043
folks on the right, and there's a question

11
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:20,113
about the right too.

12
00:00:20,113 --> 00:00:23,155
Which, they'll look at somebody
like you or like a Kanye

13
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:24,872
and instead of saying,
okay that's an individual

14
00:00:24,872 --> 00:00:26,396
who agrees with me, that's really awesome,

15
00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:28,273
they'll say, ooh, look,
a gay guy agrees with me.

16
00:00:28,273 --> 00:00:29,106
- Yes.

17
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:30,708
- And all of a sudden it's
like, ooh, total different.

18
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:31,541
- So

19
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,680
- Whereas I think the
proper response to that

20
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,311
is, okay, so he's gay,
now whatever, we agree.

21
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:36,623
That's the important thing, right?

22
00:00:36,623 --> 00:00:39,751
- Yeah, I mean, look, this
is where nobody is fully

23
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:42,683
right all the time, you know
what I mean, like we all

24
00:00:42,683 --> 00:00:45,355
have our internal biases,
we all are constantly

25
00:00:45,355 --> 00:00:47,928
trying to figure, well if
you're an honest thinker,

26
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:49,666
you're trying to figure
what's going on, so yes,

27
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,698
to both sides kind of
pick and choose when they

28
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:53,340
want to play identity
politics and all that.

29
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,282
For me, as someone that
came from the left,

30
00:00:57,282 --> 00:01:00,251
I know it so well that line of thinking

31
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:03,876
and it basically spread
like a virus throughout

32
00:01:03,876 --> 00:01:04,763
all of the left.

33
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:07,006
If you look at my show like
the first time I had you on,

34
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:08,850
which is almost three years ago already.

35
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,683
- Yeah.

36
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:10,749
And again, we did not know each other

37
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:13,033
and I think you came
in very ready to fight,

38
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:14,563
you were like, oh I'm
sitting down with a lefty,

39
00:01:14,563 --> 00:01:15,396
- Right.

40
00:01:15,396 --> 00:01:16,558
You were ready to fight
and I really was there

41
00:01:16,558 --> 00:01:18,173
- To have a conversation.

42
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:19,900
- Let's do it and look
what's happened in these last

43
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,582
couple of years where we've
become allies in this case.

44
00:01:21,582 --> 00:00:00,000
- Yeah.
