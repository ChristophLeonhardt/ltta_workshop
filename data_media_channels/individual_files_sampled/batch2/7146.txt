the RPG you were able to arrest Kenneth James Gleason for the brutal murders of Bruce Scofield and Donald smart last week quick question hypothetically if a black man targeted two white men to muddle them because of the color of their skin what are the odds he'd be called clean-cut in the headline of a newspaper pretty damn unlikely huh I think it'd be a safer bet to go with idle thug d'argo racist ugh right but remaining consistent in their efforts to stop racial fears and perpetuate stereotypes the New York Post reminds us of their scumbag eree and why racial perception remains such a pervasive intractable problem in this country the type of problem that has racist white killers described in a headline that you would expect from a goddamn tinder profile the suspected killer that the New York Post is flirting with here is 23-year old Louisiana man Kenneth Gleason who was taken into custody Tuesday and charged with two counts of first degree murder and the ambush murders of two black men but to the fine Jets at the post they thought it was best to shy away from all that stuff about the suspect and racial agenda all the brutal killings involved you know and just deem that their utmost importance that clean fucking cut be the first character description reader set their eyes upon ya they felt it was so critical at this bopper individual got humanized from the get-go rather than be seen as an accused killer but if you know the post this should be a surprise in his Melania Trump rocking Louise in a tsunami the post is already known for its ever so charming descriptions of white supremacist terrorists remember a few months bite when I'd done the story on how they did a full Bumble breakdown of the dapper man suited up and a loves black overcoat brown dress shoes and dark color pants and well-groomed oh and who by the way had traveled from Maryland to New York hell-bent on killing black people his practice resulting in the death of Timothy Coleman who by the way amidst the glorification of the white supremacist they thought it was essential to describe the victim as some sort of career criminal for committing the horrendous act of get this homestyle jumping well thank God the dapper individual with the suave overcoat and brown shoes was there to rid the world of this menacing marijuana smoking modern-day Al Capone am i right time and time again we see racial stereotypes cloud the way in vigils are portrayed in the media and it's disgusting disingenuous and downright racist here we have the same somehow still respected news outlet openly regurgitate and racial bias and its portrayal of evil white terrorists but units the victims who are dehumanized in a way that almost justifies the actions of the dapper clean-cut killers it is these perceptions that fuel racial bias just open your eyes and you will see it the New York Post is just one example but remember the way FoxNews portrays every single black victim of police brutality yeah you don't need to go scouring the internet to find an example of Fox reporting a clean-cut black individual accused of a crime I'll save you the time there is not instead they do everything in their power to make it seem that black people are the aggressors in every situation even when they're the victims and justify the actions of the police officer she was a legend Wow be aggressive when Freddie gray was killed by Baltimore police folks focused on the fight that gray had minor drug arrests mentally he was not really with it and possibly he was on drugs I had anything to do with the fight with the police neglected to secure him inside the police fine after his arrest he was tossed around like a rag doll and sustained a fatal spinal cord injury or another example the way police officers describe parent structure as a bad dude as a bad do too before the officer shot him dead it's sickening just as Timothy common was the innocent victim of a racially motivated terrorist attack sober 59 year old Bruce Caulfield and 49 year old Donald smart in Baton Rouge that should be the focus of the story not the online dating application of the fucking white supremacist suspected of committing the crimes once again we see the publishers of the New York Post value racism over common decency follow me on instagram at Francis M Maxwell and on Twitter at Francis M Maxwell like and share the video call out the New York Post and please continue to resist you
