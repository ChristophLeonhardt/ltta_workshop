1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,525
>> COURSES WHEN PETER STRZOK

2
00:00:04,525 --> 00:00:05,459
MAY OR MAY NOT TESTIFY AS WELL.

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:11,732
MOLLY, THANK YOU.

4
00:00:11,732 --> 00:00:12,499
>> LET'S CONTINUE THE

5
00:00:12,499 --> 00:00:12,933
CONVERSATION.

6
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:14,101
WE REACTION TO THE IG REPORT.

7
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:18,705
WILL BRING IN OUR FAIR AND

8
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:19,173
BALANCED PANEL.

9
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:20,741
WE HAVE A STAFF WRITER AT THE

10
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:21,475
FEDERALIST AND THE DEMOCRATIC

11
00:00:21,475 --> 00:00:22,009
STRATEGIST, ANTOINE.

12
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:22,609
I WILL START WITH YOU.

13
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:33,087
SURPRISED OR DID THIS NEAR WHAT

14
00:00:33,087 --> 00:00:33,754
YOU ALREADY THOUGHT?

15
00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:34,988
>> I THINK THERE ARE FOUR

16
00:00:34,988 --> 00:00:35,923
THINGS THAT MOST REASONABLE

17
00:00:35,923 --> 00:00:37,791
PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN FROM THE IG

18
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:38,125
REPORT.

19
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:38,826
NUMBER ONE, THE FBI WAS RIGHT

20
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:39,393
NOT TO CHARGE FAIRLY.

21
00:00:39,393 --> 00:00:40,227
BECAUSE OF THE EMAIL SCENARIO.

22
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:49,937
NUMBER TWO, THERE WAS NO

23
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:50,571
POLITICAL BIAS FOR THEIR

24
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:51,071
DECISION TO DO SO.

25
00:00:51,071 --> 00:00:51,839
NUMBER THREE, JAMES COMEY MAKES

26
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:53,207
A VERY CRITICAL MISTAKES AND

27
00:00:53,207 --> 00:00:54,108
NUMBER FOUR, THOSE MISTAKES AND

28
00:00:54,108 --> 00:00:54,942
OF HELPING DONALD TRUMP IN THE

29
00:00:54,942 --> 00:00:56,210
END.NOW, THE REPUBLICANS WILL

30
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,411
PUT THEIR SPIN AND SAY THAT

31
00:00:57,411 --> 00:00:58,078
THAT WE USE THE SEVEN WORDS

32
00:00:58,078 --> 00:00:59,680
FROM THAT TEXT MESSAGE, NO, WE

33
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,280
WILL NOT LET IT HAPPEN.

34
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,150
USE THAT AS A WAY TO POUR COLD

35
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,117
WATER ON THE ROBERT MUELLER

36
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:04,551
INVESTIGATION.

37
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:05,419
BUT THE DEVIL IS IN THE

38
00:01:05,419 --> 00:01:06,120
DETAILS.AND THOSE DETAILS IN

39
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:13,193
A 500 PAGE REPORT ARE THOSE

40
00:01:13,193 --> 00:01:13,961
FOUR THINGS I MENTIONED.>> I

41
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:14,628
WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION

42
00:01:14,628 --> 00:01:15,429
BECAUSE ANTOINE HAS THE FOUR

43
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,762
POINTS.

44
00:01:15,762 --> 00:01:24,004
AND I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION

45
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:24,738
ON THE FIRST TWO OF THEM BEFORE

46
00:01:24,738 --> 00:01:25,506
WE GET TO THE NEXT FEW.

47
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:26,240
THE FBI WAS RIGHT AND NO

48
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,707
POLITICAL BIAS.

49
00:01:26,707 --> 00:01:27,741
WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT?

50
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:29,042
I ASSUME YOU FEEL PRETTY

51
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:29,643
PASSIONATELY OTHERWISE.

52
00:01:29,643 --> 00:01:31,411
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE

53
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:32,946
ESSENTIALLY HR DEPARTMENT FOR

54
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:33,280
THE FBI.

55
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,047
AND IT IS IN THE INSPECTOR

56
00:01:34,047 --> 00:01:35,182
GENERAL REPORTS OWN INTEREST IN

57
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:37,885
ORDER TO CORRECT THE FBI AND GO

58
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:42,022
ON A BETTER PATH.

59
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:52,633
THOSE SORT OF THINGS, NOT

60
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:53,400
CHASTISING TOO GREATLY.

61
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:53,934
I THINK THAT IS

62
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:53,967
I THINK THAT DE

63
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:54,468
I THINK THAT DEFINITELY WHAT WE

64
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:54,935
SAW

65
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:54,968
THW

66
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:55,636
THROUGHOUT THE INSPECTOR

67
00:01:55,636 --> 00:01:56,103
GENERAL REPORT.

68
00:01:56,103 --> 00:01:57,137
I THINK IT CONFIRMS A LOT OF

69
00:01:57,137 --> 00:01:58,238
PEOPLES SUSPICIONS ABOUT THE

70
00:01:58,238 --> 00:01:59,406
FBI THAT IT IS RUN BY A BUNCH

71
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:00,107
OF IDIOTS AND NAEGELE MADE HE

72
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:00,607
-- MEGALOMANIACS.

73
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:03,143
IT ENDED UP HELPING DONALD

74
00:02:03,143 --> 00:02:03,977
TRUMP BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST

75
00:02:03,977 --> 00:02:05,012
IDIOTS AND TOTALLY BOTCHED THIS

76
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:06,213
THROUGHOUT THIS.

77
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:09,983
I ALSO THINK THAT IT REALLY

78
00:02:09,983 --> 00:02:19,493
TAKES A SWIPE AT JAMES COMEY

79
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:20,460
AND HIS PERSONAL CREDIBILITY.

80
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,762
I THINK THE LARGER CONSPIRACY

81
00:02:21,762 --> 00:02:22,663
THEORY WE ARE GETTING FROM THE

82
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:23,997
LEFT THAT DONALD TRUMP COLLUDED

83
00:02:23,997 --> 00:02:24,898
WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN IN ORDER TO

84
00:02:24,898 --> 00:02:26,800
STEAL THE ELECTION AWAY FROM

85
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,434
HILLARY CLINTON, THAT WAS

86
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:28,035
LARGELY DEPENDED ON THE

87
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:32,406
CREDIBILITY OF JAMES COMEY.

88
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:33,607
>> I DON'T GET PAID TO DISAGREE

89
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:37,110
WITH YOU THIS IS WHAT ANTOINE

90
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,444
IS FOR.

91
00:02:37,444 --> 00:02:38,145
THAT AND THE SECOND PIECE OF

92
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:38,879
THE ARGUMENT AS WELL.

93
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,180
>> I APPRECIATE YOU BEING FAIR

94
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,315
AND BALANCED BUT I KNOW THE

95
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:42,182
REPUBLICANS WANT TO RUN THAT

96
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:46,019
THESE TWO THINGS TOGETHER BUT

97
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,087
THE RUSH INVESTIGATION AND THE

98
00:02:47,087 --> 00:02:48,155
CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION ARE

99
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:48,855
TWO SEPARATE THINGS.

100
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:50,090
IT IS FUNNY THAT ME AND MY

101
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,258
FRIEND ON THE RIGHT TALK ABOUT

102
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:52,626
THE FBI AND THE AGENCY BEING

103
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:56,830
BASICALLY STUPID WHEN

104
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,365
REPUBLICAN PARTY SAID THEY ARE

105
00:02:58,365 --> 00:02:59,700
A PARTY OF LAW AND ORDER.

106
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,667
SOUNDS VERY HYPOCRITICAL COMING

107
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,135
FROM THE EXTREME RIGHT.

108
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:04,938
>> ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT, YOU

109
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:10,010
TALKED ABOUT JAMES COMEY AND HE

110
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,146
DID HAVE AN OP-ED IN THE NEW

111
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:13,647
YORK TIMES.

112
00:03:13,647 --> 00:03:14,548
AND I WANT TO BRING ANTOINE

113
00:03:14,548 --> 00:03:15,816
BECAUSE HE SAID HE DID DISAGREE

114
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:19,219
WITH THE IG FINDINGS BUT IT DID

115
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:20,420
NOT SOUND LIKE HE TOOK BACK HIS

116
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:20,787
DECISION.

117
00:03:20,787 --> 00:03:21,855
ANTOINE, I WANTED TO RESPOND TO

118
00:03:21,855 --> 00:03:23,890
THAT AND THEN I WILL GET YOUR

119
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,391
TAKE, BRE PAYTON.

120
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:26,293
>> I'M NOT A FAN OF JAMES

121
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:26,593
COMEY.

122
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:32,366
IN MY OPINION I THINK HE CAUSED

123
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:33,267
HILLARY CLINTON ELECTION.

124
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:34,434
BUT IT IS FUNNY TO HAVE THE

125
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:35,369
REPUBLICANS BEAT UP ON HIM WHEN

126
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:36,270
BEFORE ALL THIS, HE WAS LIKE

127
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,239
THE ANGEL CHILD OF THE

128
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:39,740
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

129
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,240
HE WAS THEIR GUY.

130
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,475
NOW THIS HAPPENED AND ALL OF A

131
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:42,209
SUDDEN HE IS A BAD GUY.

132
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,979
>> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE.

133
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:47,314
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER TWO

134
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:53,687
WEEKS AGO WHEN THE DEMOCRATS

135
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:54,621
LOVED JAMES COMEY AND THEY ALL

136
00:03:54,621 --> 00:03:56,123
SAID HE WAS THE LAST HONEST BOY

137
00:03:56,123 --> 00:03:56,790
SCOUT IN WASHINGTON D.C.. I

138
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,258
HAVE TO HAVE BEEN ON THIS

139
00:03:58,258 --> 00:03:59,559
CHANNEL -- I HAVE HEARD THAT

140
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:00,260
FROM A LOT OF LIBERALS AND A

141
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,995
LOT OF DEMOCRATS WHO I'VE HAD

142
00:04:01,995 --> 00:04:12,439
TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT THIS

143
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:13,440
LOT OF DEMOCRATS WHO I'VE HAD
TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT THIS AND

144
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,574
SAY I HAVE BEEN SAYING FROM THE

145
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:15,809
START, WAS JAMES COMEY MADE THE

146
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:17,110
ANNOUNCEMENT IN OCTOBER 2016, I

147
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,778
SAID HE WAS AN IDIOT THEN.

148
00:04:17,778 --> 00:04:18,445
EVEN THOUGH IT HURT HILLARY

149
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:19,146
CLINTON.I STILL THOUGHT IT

150
00:04:19,146 --> 00:04:19,745
WAS A BAD MOVE.

151
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:25,919
I STILL THOUGHT HE WAS AN

152
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:26,219
IDIOT.

153
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:27,954
I THINK IT DEMONSTRATE THE FBI

154
00:04:27,954 --> 00:04:28,722
NEEDS A LOT OF HELP AND TO

155
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:29,456
REVIEW HIRING PRACTICES.

156
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:30,123
>> I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD

157
00:04:30,123 --> 00:04:30,791
BECAUSE IN THE INTEREST OF

158
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,025
TIME, EVEN THOUGH THE IG REPORT

159
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:32,793
AND THE ROBERT MUELLER

160
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:34,161
INVESTIGATION ARE TWO TOTALLY

161
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:37,631
DIFFERENT THINGS AND WE ARE

162
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:38,265
CONSTANTLY REMINDING --

163
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:38,732
>> TO BE CLEAR!

164
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:39,433
>> WE ARE THE PRESIDENT SAM

165
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:42,903
FRIDAY HE WAS EXONERATED AND

166
00:04:42,903 --> 00:04:43,670
THOSE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS.

167
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,871
THAT BEING SAID, IS THERE

168
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:46,073
IMPACT FROM THE IG REPORT ON

169
00:04:46,073 --> 00:04:54,314
THE INVESTIGATION?

170
00:04:54,314 --> 00:04:55,582
MEANING, IS IT GETTING IMPACTED

171
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:57,050
BY THIS IG REPORT WHETHER IT BE

172
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,684
PERCEPTION OR IN ANY WAY?

173
00:04:57,684 --> 00:05:07,894
I WILL START

174
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:08,929
PERCEPTION OR IN ANY WAY?
I WILL START WITH YOU, BRE.

175
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:09,963
>> IT IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE

176
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:11,231
FROM THE HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL

177
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:12,432
INVESTIGATION.

178
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:13,066
HOWEVER, IN THE INSPECTOR

179
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:13,767
GENERAL REPORT ITSELF, PETER

180
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:15,435
STRZOK, THE REASON WHY HE DID

181
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:16,169
NOT COME FORWARD, THE REASON

182
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:16,870
THEY DID NOT GET A WARRANT TO

183
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,938
SEARCH ANTHONY WEINER'S LAPTOP

184
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:18,772
WAS BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS

185
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:20,674
THEY WERE PRIORITIZING ABOUT

186
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:21,375
HILLARY CLINTON'S EMAILS WAS

187
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,042
THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE

188
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:22,776
TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND WHETHER OR

189
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:23,877
NOT THERE WERE TIES TO RUSSIAN

190
00:05:23,877 --> 00:05:24,244
OFFICIALS.

191
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:34,488
WHILE THEY ARE

192
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:34,521
OFFICIALS.

193
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:34,888
WHILE THEY ARE SEPARATE

194
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:35,722
INVESTIGATIONS, THEY ARE BEING

195
00:05:35,722 --> 00:05:36,757
HANDLED BY THE SAME PEOPLE.

196
00:05:36,757 --> 00:05:37,824
A LOT OF THE SAME PEOPLE THAT

197
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:38,992
WORKED ON BOTH OF THE PROBES,

198
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:39,960
EXPRESSED A LOT OF POLITICAL

199
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,261
BIAS AND POLITICAL OPINIONS

200
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:41,962
ABOUT NOT LIKING DONALD TRUMP

201
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:42,629
AND LIKING HILLARY CLINTON.

202
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:45,332
IN TEXT MESSAGES AND OFTEN

203
00:05:45,332 --> 00:05:46,233
CONFLATED AND IN THE SAME

204
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:46,933
CONVERSATION, THEY WOULD SAY

205
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:48,335
THEIR POLITICAL OPINIONS AND

206
00:05:48,335 --> 00:05:49,035
SEEMINGLY IN THE SAME BREATH

207
00:05:49,035 --> 00:05:49,770
SAY, THIS IS WHAT WE ARE GOING

208
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,538
TO DO ABOUT BOTH OF THESE

209
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:52,005
INVESTIGATIONS.

210
00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:52,672
YOU ARE RIGHT THAT THEY ARE

211
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:54,007
SEPARATE AND THERE IS OVERLAP.

212
00:05:54,007 --> 00:06:03,383
I THINK WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE

213
00:06:03,383 --> 00:06:03,717
APPEAR.

214
00:06:03,717 --> 00:06:04,418
>> ANTOINE YOU GET THE LAST

215
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:04,718
WORD.

216
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:05,719
>> THERE IS A BIG CHANCE AT ALL

217
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:06,653
OF US HAVE A POLITICAL THEME.

218
00:06:06,653 --> 00:06:07,888
AND THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT

219
00:06:07,888 --> 00:06:08,688
THINGS, THE BOTTOM LINE IS,

220
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:10,223
THIS, THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES

221
00:06:10,223 --> 00:06:10,924
IT RELEVANT IS THAT THE RIGHT

222
00:06:10,924 --> 00:06:11,892
WING AND THE PRESIDENT WOULD

223
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:12,859
TRY TO PUSH THESE TOGETHER TO

224
00:06:12,859 --> 00:00:00,000
MAKE THE CASE TO PULLED COLD
