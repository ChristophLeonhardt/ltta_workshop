1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,460
YOU KNOW DONALD TRUMP OF
COURSE FIRE JAMES COMEY, FORMER

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,620
HEAD OF THE FBI.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,620
WHY?

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,189
HE SAID ON
NATIONAL TV IN AN INTERVIEW WITH

5
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:10,740
NBC, BECAUSE HE WAS
INVESTIGATING RUSSIA.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,740
THANKS FOR

7
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,290
ADMITTING OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE, BUT HE'S NOT DONE YET,

8
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,780
HE ALSO WANTED TO GET RID OF
JEFF SESSIONS, THE ATTORNEY

9
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,990
GENERAL, BECAUSE HE WASN'T
SUFFICIENTLY LOYAL ENOUGH.

10
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,990
HE

11
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,560
LET ROD ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL, PUT A SPECIAL

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,560
COUNSEL.

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,880
SO HE'S AGITATED, HE
WANTS TO FIRE EVERYONE

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,380
INVESTIGATING HIM.

15
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,690
I WONDER WHY,
I WONDER IF IT'S BECAUSE TRUMP

16
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,910
IS A CRIMINAL WHO WANTS TO HIDE
HIS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY?

17
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,170
OKAY, SO

18
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,290
NOW WHAT DOES HE WANT?

19
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:51,290
OKAY, IT
TURNS OUT AXIOS HAS NEW

20
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,290
REPORTING --

21
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,700
>>SO IT TURNS OUT CHRISTOPHER
WRAY, THE HERO IN THIS STORY.

22
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,700
I

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,420
DON'T KNOW CHRISTOPHER WRAY'S
POLITICS AND GIVEN THAT HE WAS

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,180
APPOINTED BY DEEPLY RIGHT-WING
FORCES MY GUESS IS THAT HE'S NOT

25
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,070
GOING TO AGREE WITH ME MUCH
POETICALLY.

26
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,070
BUT IF YOU STAND UP

27
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,240
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO
DESTROY RULE OF LAW IN THIS

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,970
COUNTRY, DESTROY OUR
CONSTITUTION AND SYSTEM OF

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,189
GOVERNMENT, THEN GOD BLESS YOUR
HEART, YOU ARE AN AMERICAN HERO.

30
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:20,210
AT LEAST ON THAT.

31
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,400
AND BY THE
WAY, COMEY, FOR ALL HIS FOIBLES

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,580
AND UPS AND DOWNS, REMEMBER,
FORGET TRUMP, FORGET CLINTON, HE

33
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,710
ALSO STOOD UP TO BUSH WHEN BUSH
WAS TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE RULE

34
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,520
OF LAW JAMES COMEY STOOD UP.

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,970
HE
STOOD UP TO TRUMP WHEN TRUMP

36
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,450
DEMANDED LOYALTY AND SAID YOU
BETTER BE LOYAL TO ME AND AND

37
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,070
THE INVESTIGATION OF FLYNN, AND
COMEY DIDN'T DO IT, THAT'S WHAT

38
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,070
HE WAS FIRED.

39
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,750
SO THERE ARE A
COUPLE OF HEROES IN HER

40
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,250
GOVERNMENT.

41
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,740
MORE --

42
00:01:53,740 --> 00:02:00,909
>>SO THERE IS SESSIONS TRYING
TO PLEASE DONALD TRUMP, GOING,

43
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:05,560
YES, AFTER YOU TOLD ME I SHOULD
RESIGN AND I'M A LOSER AND I

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,729
SHOULD BE FIRED, OKAY, NOW I'LL
DO WHATEVER YOU SAY, DEAR

45
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,729
LEADER.

46
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,790
AND HE GOES TO FIRE THE
DEPUTY DIRECTOR TRUMP DOESN'T

47
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,029
LIKE BECAUSE OF THE
INVESTIGATIONS OF HIMSELF, AND

48
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:19,560
IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE WRAY
STANDUP, AND EVEN THE WHITE

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,760
HOUSE COUNSEL SAYS DON'T DO IT,
IT WILL BE AN ABSOLUTE MESS.

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,939
NOW, WHY DO YOU THINK DONALD
TRUMP IS TRYING TO FIRE EVERYONE

51
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,150
WHO IS INVESTIGATING HIM?

52
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,170
BY THE
WAY, ALSO PEOPLE INVESTIGATING

53
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,209
RUSSIA, LIKE PREET BHARARA DOING
A MASSIVE INVESTIGATION OF

54
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,840
RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS IN THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MANHATTAN,

55
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,519
AND THEN EVEN THOUGH TRUMP SAID
HE WOULD STAY ON HE WAS FIRED

56
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:44,650
IMMEDIATELY, AND THE CASE WAS
SETTLED.

57
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,650
RIGHT AFTER THAT THE

58
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,689
RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS WERE FREE TO
GO.

59
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:50,840
THEY PAID A MINOR FINE IN

60
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,209
THAT CASE AND THEY WRAPPED IT
ALL UP.

61
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:54,709
SO FIRE ANYONE WHO IS

62
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,790
INVESTIGATING DONALD TRUMP OR
THE RUSSIANS.

63
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,959
GEE, I WONDER WHY.

64
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,459
BUT I'M TOLD THERE IS NO
EVIDENCE.

65
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:02,650
GOLLY GEE, WHAT WOULD

66
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,849
BE THE CONNECTION OF RUSSIA AND
TRUMP?

67
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:06,269
TRUMP BEING WORRIED ABOUT

68
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,379
A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF
HIMSELF, WHAT WOULD GIVE YOU

69
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:10,379
THAT IDEA?

70
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:14,409
YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE
BLIND NOT TO SEE THAT DONALD

71
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:17,879
TRUMP IS TRYING TO COVER HIS OWN
ASS AND FIRE ANYONE WHO

72
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,989
INVESTIGATES THEM.

73
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:20,329
GEE, I WONDER
WHY.

74
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,980
I HAVE A GUESS, BECAUSE HE

75
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:27,480
FUCKING DID IT, THAT'S WHY.

76
00:03:27,480 --> 00:00:00,000
WAKE
UP.
