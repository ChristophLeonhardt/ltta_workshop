OTHER LAME LINE OF ATTACK AGAINST THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS HOPEFUL VERY OPTIMISTIC SUPPORTERS. AND THAT'S THE ANGLE. JOINING ME NOW TO REACT RIGHT HERE ON FOX NEWS, HOWARD CURT AND DICK MORRIS. I'M BEEN DYING TO TALK TO ALL I DON'T HAVE YOU GUYS TODAY ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WHEN I STARTED HEARING THIS MEME THIS WEEK, "OH, IT'S THE CULT OF TRUMP," THEY TRIED TO SAY HE WAS DUMB, HE HAD DEMENTIA. REMEMBER THAT LAST YEAR? THEY NEEDED TO REMOVE HIM FROM OFFICE. LIKE THE CABINET HAD TO BE ACTIVATED. DICK MORRIS, YOU'VE SEEN THE I THINK HIS POLICY IS CRUCIAL. BUT I THINK THE THING ABOUT HIS PERSONALITY THAT IS CAPTURING PEOPLE IS THAT HE'S CONGRUENT WITH WHAT PEOPLE WANT. WE WANT THE PRESIDENT TO GET STUFF DONE WITHOUT WAFFLING OR WITH WINDS BLOWING. AND TRUMP IS A BUILDER. HE'S A DEVELOPER. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. HE GETS IT BUILT. AND WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT KOREA OR THE ECONOMY, THE CRITICS ALL SAY HE CAN'T DO IT, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. BUT THEN HE GETS IT DONE. HE IMPLEMENTS IT. EVEN AFTER IT'S DONE, THEY STILL SAY HE DIDN'T DO IT OR IT'LL COME APART. AND THAT CREATES A REAL SENSE THAT THIS GUY IS SOMEONE TO FOLLOW BECAUSE HE GETS IT DONE. IT'S THE SAME CONCEPT THAT INSPIRED REAGAN AND EVEN CHURCHILL SUPPORTERS, THAT WE DON'T CARE IF HE LEFT OR RIGHT, WE LOVE THE WAY HE ACTS, THE WAY HE GETS IT DONE AND EXPRESSES OUR INNERMOST DESIRES ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO FOR US. HE'S UNAPOLOGETIC ABOUT HIS DESIRE AND IMPATIENCE FOR CHANGE FOR AMERICAN WORKERS. THAT'S JUST REFRESHING. YOU'VE BEEN AROUND WASHINGTON FOR SONG. IT'S REFRESHING TO HEAR SOMEONE TODAY. WHAT DID HE SPEND, LIKE 45 MINUTES WITH ANSWERING QUESTIONS JUST OUT IN THE DRIVEWAY. I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT. BUT YOU JUST WROTE A PIECE ABOUT THE SUPPOSED CULT PHENOMENON. SO TELL US YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT WHERE THE REAL CULT ME THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD FOLLOW SUCH A LEADER ARE MINDLESS, DELUSIONAL WHACK JOBS. THERE'S A SENSE HERE, IT'S ONLY ABOUT 15 SECONDS ON THE GOOGLE TO FIND NEW YORK TIMES EDITORIAL LAST WEEK, THE CULT OF TRUMP. NATIONAL JOURNAL LAST YEAR. I GET THE IDEA THAT THIS IS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND WHETHER OUT OF LOYALTY OR OUT OF FEAR, MANY REPUBLICANS ARE FALLING INTO LINE. BUT TO CALL IT A CULT, AND NO ONE GETS UPSET ABOUT IT. THEY STILL DON'T QUITE GRASP TRUMP'S APPEAL. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO ME THAT NOW A YEAR AND A HALF INTO THIS, HIS NUMBERS ARE GOING UP, MUELLER'S ARE GOING DOWN. ALL THE MEASURES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. CONFIDENCE IS UP, A POSSIBLE DENUCLEARIZED KOREA. I JUST HAD TO PLAY SOMETHING BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS. LINDSEY GRAHAM TODAY WAS BEING CRITICIZED FOR ACTUALLY WORKING WITH TRUMP. LET'S WATCH. I LIKE THE PRESIDENT. I TRUST HIM IN TERMS OF TRYING TO DO THINGS THAT ARE BIG AND MATTER. BUT PEOPLE SAY THIS IS TWO-FACED. WHERE AT THE GRAHAM OF STANDING UP TO DONALD TRUMP. WHAT DO YOU SAY? WHEN I WORKED WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, AND I DID ON OCCASION, I WAS A HERO. NOW WHEN I WORK WITH TRUMP, I'M TWO-FACED. I KNOW HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED. IF YOU DON'T LIKE ME WORKING WITH TRUMP TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE, I DON'T GIVE A . THEY'RE TRYING EVERYTHING BUT NONE OF IT IS STICKING. I'M TELLING YOU, I THINK THEY'RE OUT OF POLITICAL AMMO HERE. CLOSE IT OUT FOR US. I THINK THERE ARE TWO THINGS. I THINK FIRST PEOPLE THE DEMOCRATS BET ON IMPEACHMENT. THEY BET ON RUSSIAGATE. AND THAT'S FALLING APART AND THEY HAVE NO B PLAN. AND SECONDLY ON POLICY, IT'S SO CLEAR WE'RE OPPOSED TO TRUMP'S ECONOMY, TRUMP IS HORRIBLE, THAT WHEN HE ACCOMPLISHES SOMETHING, THEY CAN'T SHARE THE SPOTLIGHT. THEY CAN'T SHARE THE CREDIT. REPUBLICANS COULD SHARE CLINTON'S CREDIT FOR HEALTHCARE REFORM AND THE BALANCED BUDGET. THEY'RE FRESH OUT OF IDEAS. IT'S SHOWING.
