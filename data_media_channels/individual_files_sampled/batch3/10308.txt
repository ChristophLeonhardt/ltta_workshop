this week the Stan Collymore Show comes to one of the qualifiers in the FIFA World Cup in Russia in the summer it also hosted the first World Cup of the 21st century welcome to Japan this is Tokyo but we're gonna be visiting Colby to see World Cup win our Lukas Podolski he won the World Cup with Germany and we're giving out to the north of the country sapporo famous for beer but also for football and a good friend of mine J borange arigato but I'm delighted to be joined by Ben Maybury we're here in salubrious surroundings in in tokyo jay sports h studios which hosts the premier league and many other sports in japan Ben is one of the the main commentators and he just happens to be an Englishman so I heard you were getting together never a good old chat about football jaylee now he's 25 years old how strong is it in your opinion these days it's kind of hit some hurdles and reached the turning point in the last 10 years I think until that point I don't think there's been many examples around the world of a league that have started essentially from scratch and got so good so quickly to the point where it was exporting players to AC Milan to Inter Milan there within this face of really 15 20 years when those star names went and the next generation didn't quite live up to the same standards now it's what do we do and so there's I think there's a bit of a period where everyone has to be patient and maybe wait for the stars to come back before we can really get to the next growth phase the j-league was the first league that kick-started the a-league in Australia MLS that started about 1996 so the j-league really was the sort of the blue touch paper and the experiment for many other news of him emerging leagues yeah you had to fail to NASL in North America of course but and yeah I think in Japan now even even me we have a tendency to be a little bit negative because it what of what's happening now I'll say if you look at the first 15 years to come from essentially nothing in terms of a footballing culture that was quite incredible you had before the j-league you had a company league where teams that were called literally called Nissan you know the car manufacturer that team became Yokohama Marinos now Yokohama F Marinos but they were Nissan they were put there a company team effectively owned by the company and in in many ways who had sort of plays players signed as as professionals that were kind of ring is but the culture of going to watch football go to support your local team thinking about the kids coming up in future that didn't really exist Japan was a baseball what's in company which is also more for a corporate sport to go from that the j-league initially was heavily funded so it was a big marketing success but the real success they made was in the opening years they knew that marketing and money wasn't gonna be a long-term thing and so they made each club have a hometown rule and they even designate this is our hometown we're not a company team we're that we ever seemed that represents this town this part of the country this is this is us they are us the j-league started in 1993 that year the national team have got to the point where they just missed out qualifying for the World Cup they then qualified in 98 they got to host it in 2002 and we're pretty good you know and to do that in such a short period of time was quite incredible and as you say influence over the place as well tell us a little bit about Japanese football culture how important it is how big the game here is now the provincial towns they got the sports teams and they also attracted a new audience baseball watches in the past or maybe they were you know company guys who go after work now this was not a dividing line was drawn with company so no this is a cultural thing this is for the local people and the level of commitment that you get from the local support series of stunning and the club's don't typically own their own stadiums and so you can't leave your flags and your decorations there so the four supporters will turn up for hours before quick kickoff to be let in to decorate the stadiums it's it's something that the localities can be proud of thank you so much a great honour to come to work as you plan and appear on your show as well let's go from Tokyo to Kobe two hours on the world-famous bullet train so we've got off the bullet train from Tokyo to Kobe beautiful Kobe and Alan Gibson is an Englishman is also a less-than for the fan like me and an expert on Japanese football he's been in cabaret for 20-plus years so when in Rome do as the Romans do winning Kobe eat beef that's gonna talk some football and eat some beef the 2018 World Cup how far can Japan go again it's it's the same you know with almost any team and of course you expect Brazil and Argentina and Spain whatever may be invented to top the group and go through but that group he's I'm in Senegal could win it there's some good players maybe for Senegal Poland might collapse completely lemon dust it might be injured then Japan has in their squad of 23 I presume there's gonna be five six seven world class players in my opinion that could easily be playing in the Premier League literally anybody can win that group and if Japan are on their game they can top the group but they'll be happy with a win and two draws maybe an even a win and a draw would be enough seriously that might be the best pace of may about ever had - teammate finish last night in the Japanese league cup and that LAN Lukas Podolski scored the two goals for Vissel Kobe to warm down today to see the players you step on a little stretch got an old friend here the Telstar ball which we used at the World Cup let's have a chat with the man himself Lukas Podolski Yoji found life in japan it's good for now you know I'm now nearly eight or nine months you know it was okay I think the life is very good the foot of course for my family as well so we felt we felt very not like out how to say friendly friendly people it's safety it's no stress in this city in this country so of course as I say life is very good last season will finish at nine positions for hope we can we can bring this club to another level but it takes time is cannot be done everything in one year so I think it's needs you know three to five years to bring the club to to a top club in in Asia and this is our target that's our that's why I'm here to help the club on the pitch and off the pitch and I hope you know I can bring my experience my quality in this club and then we will see what's what's happened very important the Germans have players like monkey players that being there during whatever it is it's important but I think it's not the most important you know like you look to China you know a lot of players move there I think for another reason and a lot of players have gone already back so I think it's not important to bring names in a country important is to make the the Japanese players better to make the quality of the j-league better to push the the Japanese player more to bring more talented players to the to the first team to bring more and more players to Europe from from Japan I think this is this is the key point Japan will be pressing to see I think is a lot of quality in the j-league you know it's a nice stadium around the supporters is good you know there's a lot of a lot of teams and in the Champions League last year Japanese team when the Champions League so I think the quality is really good in Asia but still as I said before it's a lot of potential in this country of course the baseball or other sports you know are the number one but I I watch it but you see to to the to the to the US you know there is basketball this football there is baseball but there's still the soccer and still they have the good marketing and they use a different thing and I think this is as well the key point from from the j-league they have to use more the marketing side to bring the j-league not to the distance to the baseball here so a little bit closer and I think this is one thing as well as they have to they have to push the next year's it's hard for Japan but still they can make it I think you know it's interesting this group is very interesting the or at least mr. sighs thank you very much for joining me on the static help show it's great to see you I hope you continue having a long and successful career and many goals to cross-sector up thank you very much for jewelry's thank you this is the sapporo dome it was one of the stadiums for the 2002 World Cup in England famously played here against Argentina and David Beckham scored a penalty at that end of the pitch pitch technology in 2018 has come a very long way in the World Cup in some petersburg you'll see a retractable roof you'll see great pitch technology likewise in Kazan and this is really where it all started in Sapporo you see this track this whole huge area of concrete swivels moves around why come with me as we walk over to here usually you come into a stadium and the pitch would be here it's above my level I'm one meter ninety-two six foot four oh there is the football pitch the whole thing comes all put on pneumatics out into the open air it's Tokyo winter Cole Bates had a chat with Lukas Podolski and today we can have a chat with a good friend of mine J both Roy an Englishman that's played all the way through the English divisions and leagues and the last three years has made Japan is home J it's great to see you tell us about Japanese life and Japanese football culture I mean when I first came it they say like Sun means mister and you know even when I'm on the pitch people knock you down kick you in the heart Jason Jason sorry sorry sorry pick you up like it's kind of like really the antithesis of playing competitive football where you have exactly yeah I think here in a sense it's still regarded as a game whereas in Europe in England you know it's regarded as you know life or death you do anything to win a point you know you play against your friends you know you don't speak to them you kick them you leave them on the floor you know you try and get their the edge over them but here it's very respectful you know the way they treat you off the pitch is the way they treat you on the pitch your career you've played for lots of different clubs and probably most notably early on your career which doesn't happen with a lot of English players is you went and played in Italy then you've come to Asia and played for several clubs in Asia that's unusual for an Englishman I mean when I was playing you played in England that was it I love that there's been exceptions like Steve McManaman and now Gerard and Lampard gone off to the States but that was unusual to go off to Peru's you when you did is that always something that you wanted to do as a footballer that not just play football but play football in different countries and cultures I mean especially Italy when I went to Italy you know me and me and my dad are really close you know we obviously you take all my games you know I used to watch football on a weekend go to football matches even watch youth team sometimes you know Tottenham's training ground used to be close to my house so we used to go and watch the youth team that when I wasn't playing and you know we saw just Italian football on channel 4 and that's what you know kind of got me into it I was thinking then that you know I always want to go and play in Syria I had the opportunity to go it was kind of like of course I didn't want to leave home and my family you know I just had my son but it was like a dream that I wanted to achieve and for me I've never really been the person for home to me is where my family is you know so when my family comes to Italy Japan wherever I've been that's home for me Japan traditionally you know you think of Shizuka Ghawar of course genichi and the most of it you've got the club here that midfielders suit the Japanese mentality technically very good generally if you look at the players in Europe they're all kind of like they play number Ten's order white players or air fullbacks you don't really see like a center half or a defensive midfielder that puts in tackles they're all kind of like luxury players almost and that's the that's the high quality players they produce here and then they go abroad you know if you look in the j-league a lot of the defenders are Brazilian South Korea you know where they're more aggressive they're bigger you know Japan look at the rest of Europe now especially the best teams like Barcelona Man City you know and you're see teams trying to emulate that kind of style so I like that passing out from the key part you know building up Japan is in the World Cup in a group with Poland Colombia and Senegal can the national team really make a dent on a world called well that's this is what I said you know had this called a social with many people and journalists and players I don't see what I can't you know because again technically they're very good players but I think what holds the Japan national team back is the mentality it's like I said to them it's a game you know they should qualify every year you know their planning is in the disrespect but depending against teams like Thailand so they should they should qualify for every tournament and you know with ease really but when they qualified this time it was like they were celebrating like they've won the World Cup and to me it should be like okay yeah we've qualified you know I want to see them do what you know South Korea did yeah when they go into the semi-final they wanted to but they got there and is like obviously hardwork compete in you know if you look at the group don't get me wrong they've got it's like Senegal Poland they're good teams but I wouldn't say not then they're definitely not gonna qualify it's a group that they can get out of but you know in the World Cup you need to start well he's very opinionated and you have that broad knowledge of the game of him being around the world what do you want to do post football to be honest I never really thought about coaching or management to me I dedicated my life to football from like nine years old you know you like you do and you know I love the game don't get me wrong I never really thought about it until I came here and I fought you know when I was here I'm thinking actually I've worked with some really good managers you know a syringa raised me you know work with Mike Hughes how Redknapp and you know when I was in Italy I had a good manager I was obviously I got called out to England one time and I see the way Capello put sessions on on whatnot and I feel like I do have some knowledge so I was thinking if I am gonna be a manager or coach I would like to do it here because it's a good place to to D coaching bad use to get good support yeah I think all clubs have got good facilities and infrastructure yeah I think so I think you know I think I'm gonna start at this year for me my dream was to play in the Premier League which I've done earned a lot of money which I've done play for my country which I've done play a board which I've done so for me I can look back at my career I say I've achieved what I set out to don't get me wrong I've made mistakes a lot of mistakes on the way we all do where my career could have gone a different way and I could have played long going out I did waste a lot of time you know messing around you know going out partying when I should have stayed in and that's a part of learning and and living you know you have to you know see mistakes how you approach your seizure for me personally of course I want to I want to score goals I love to score goals but for me like when I was younger I used to set myself a target and it beginning in the season I said I want to score 15 goals honours for 20 gold but for me if you can see you're not reaching that target it starts to curl your mind exactly so for me I always say to myself I want to you know play well in that game this is what I need to do in this game so I always take each game at a time rather than look in the future I'd prefer to you know I just want to try on each day no no I think the reason why I'm you know I can still move around and run freely and you know run part 20 year old 25 year old is because I didn't waste a lot of time when I was when I was young you know I was you know sitting on the bench and you know doing stupidest and I feel like now I'm at the back end of my career I feel like I value every single day so I train hard I keep myself in shape I don't go out no more I eat the right fit you know I tried to live a vegan life you know and I don't to be honest I'm not just saying this because you hear that well night when I was growing up my dad always said to me look at Stan Collymore play you know he's a good on the pitch you know when you're playing for forests and whatnot obviously you as I played it I looked and I was like yeah he's good because there wasn't many of you around we're like normally it was like a typical centre forward long ball off getting the boat and then you come along and you're turning people dribbling and shooting left or and it was like that was a difference and it was like that's what I wanted to do I never wanted to be one of these four words that wasn't involved in a game that would just touch the ball win a six-yard box and score a goal for me I want to enjoy it I want to get on the ball I want to express myself I want to dribble I want to be involved I want to touch the ball life you know 30 40 times a game and I want to be a part of it it's great to see you what a fantastic time in this country and the one thing that I've learned is that the Japanese a very differential very respectful and they take that onto the football pitch J ba Floyd himself said it Allen Gibson said it can they be ruthless enough nasty enough to win a FIFA World Cup in years to come that's what I'm taking from a Japan true but now relax time for a bit of fun before the next trick Oh
