on Monday Donald Trump signed an executive order banning federal funding for overseas abortions reinstating the so-called Mexico City policy originally created by Ronald Reagan this is terrific news it should be followed swiftly by ending federal funding for Planned Parenthood press secretary Sean Spicer bluntly stated quote he's a pro-life president he wants to stand up for all Americans including the unborn we can certainly hope that trumps action on Mexico City policy is not a one-off and it shouldn't be because here's the truth more and more Americans are now pro-life as guy Benson of townhall.com points out a new Marist Poll shows 83% of Americans agree with Trump's actions here 52% of Americans want to limit abortion to rare cases another 22% want to outlaw abortion after the first trimester under 40% of Americans think abortion is morally acceptable and there is no gender gap on whether abortion is morally wrong despite what the women's March organizers would have Americans believe so what's changed why are so many Americans now pro-life because science ultrasounds have made it impossible for Americans to deny any longer that abortion does not destroy a human life ultrasounds show the reality of fetal development heartbeat by week six is a pretty obvious marker it's no wonder that are reported 78% of pregnant women who see an ultrasound of their child say no to abortion so naturally the left wants to end ultrasounds Planned Parenthood has bought 3d ultrasounds for years that's the amazing technology that allows you to see your kids face before birth as dr. L La Croix of Planned Parenthood recently said quote abortion is a hard enough thing for any woman to decide without the torture of seeing the baby on an ultrasound screen torture how about reality but according to the pro-abortion left reality must be ignored today the Atlantic ran a bizarre piece by Moira Weigel titled in Orwellian fashion quote how the ultrasound pushed the idea that a fetus is a person which is somewhat like saying how the microscope pushed the idea that cells exists or how the Hubble telescope pushed the idea that there are stars outside our solar system or how human eyes push the idea that the Atlantic is fully insane the fetus is a person an ultrasound is a piece of technology that allows you to see the person the piece itself is actually even worse Weigel writes quote what is a fetal heartbeat and why does it matter fetal heartbeat measure are based on two assumptions first that an ultrasound image has an obvious meaning second that any pregnant woman who sees an ultrasound will recognize this meaning science does not bear out either assumption well yeah it sort of does wykel science denial here is pretty incredible having seen repeat ultrasounds of both my children the fetal development is clear and undeniable and it is nearly impossible to see such images without recognizing that there is a child in there not some random clump of cells Weigel might talk to an ob/gyn or two before declaring ultrasounds vague and uninformative but Weibull goes even further assuring readers that ultrasounds were primarily a form of warfare against women rather than a tool allowing doctors to identify problems with fetal development as early as possible this is direct quote from her article now after the war army trained scientists and army funded laboratories immobilized the technology turning away from the ocean toward women's bodies ultrasound made it impossible made it possible for the male doctor to evaluate the fetus without female interference yes really this is the ultrasound it's a war on women that's basically that side note here and when my second child is when my first child had a heart issue that got fixed after she was born our second child we actually did an ultrasound of while he was in utero to determine whether he had the same issue thank God he didn't but that would have been possible is that ultrasound let's war for abortion now takes no prisoners science itself must be fought tooth and nail if women are to keep killing the babies in their wombs it's not going to work I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show ah here we are and so much to get to it's going to be an epic episode today a good Trump bad Trump because finally finally finally Trump's president so we don't have to speculate any longer about what he's going to do and what he's going to say as president because now he is and there is so much to talk about because he's really active which is great good for him he's actually getting to work he's not he's not fussing around so that's a good thing and he's doing some things that I like him he's doing some things that I don't but we'll talk about all of that first we have to take thank you to our sponsors over a legacy box so for years I've been saying to people that it is imperative that if you want to ensure that your family memories are preserved for posterity you

gets down to business finally he gets to work we're putting aside all of the silliness over the conflicts with the press and finally Donald Trump is doing stuff so what is Donald Trump doing well yesterday he signed a bunch of executive orders and now it's time for us to do what we're going to be doing all all administration loans and do some good Trump bad Trump and the reason we do this is because it is very important to note when Donald Trump is doing things that are good and no one he is doing things that are bad there are lots of people who seem to think that because Donald Trump does some good things that means you should never critique him when he does bad things or wrong things this is not my perspective you can make your own judgments on what you think of Trump you're an adult good for you and I can make my own judgment but what I certainly can do is I can tell you the things he's doing that are good and the things that he's doing that are bad so you are more informed coming away from the ventia Piro show every day so let's play the theme good Trump bad Trump let's do it so there was a plenty of good Trump to go around yesterday yes plenty of good Trump so Donald Trump I by the way I always thought this was going to be the case that Donald Trump's first hundred days we're going to be filled with things that I liked and then I thought he's going to go a little bit off the rails after that but so far that prediction is is on track so Donald Trump started off yesterday as I mentioned by signing an executive order reinstating the Mexico City policy which means that your tax dollars now no longer go to organizations that promotes or perform abortions abroad that's great that's great is it a huge step it's not only it's an enormous step but it's a great important step good for not old Trump on that other things that he did yesterday that were quite good he came out and he said that he was going to cut regulations he signed an executive order that froze federal hiring in the executive branch which is which is quite good so here is the here as equipped with them talking about it we think we can cut regulations by 75% maybe more but by 75% have in a certain way better protections but when you want to expand your plan or when mark wants to come in and build a big massive plant or wind l1 succumbing to do something monstrous and special you're going to have your approvals really fast okay sir and and the one thing that surprised me that I want here would you have to say but the one thing that surprised been going around and meeting with a lot of the people with disables and meeting with a lot of the small business owners if I gave them a choice of this massive tax decrease that we're giving for business for everybody but for business or the cutting down of regulation if I took a vote I think the regulation wins 100 percent now in one case it's hard dollars and the other case it's regulation you would think that the regulations would have no chance it's I've noticed anything like it virtually everybody is happier with regulation than even cutting the taxes so the regulations are going to be cut massively and the taxes are going to be cut way down so you're going to have now incentive incentive to build ok so good for Trump good for Trump this is the kind of stuff that he was elected to do good for him so this is another one of his big of his big pitches okay then we get to a little bit of bad well actually you know a little bit more good from then we'll get to bathroom so other good Trump Trump apparently is now looking to chop down the the Environmental Protection Agency to size he apparently has pulled the Center for Disease Control out of some global warming climate change conference I don't know why the CDC is going to a global warming conference in the first place as far as the EPA thing apparently they've gotten an agency action plan for the EPA been putting out right now and it's great so a pet that they're looking at budget reductions they're looking at 513 million dollars in cuts to state and tribal assistant grants 193 million dollars in savings from terminating climate programs 109 million dollars in savings from environment programs and management they're going to stop the Clean Air Act greenhouse gas regulations so this is this idiotic notion that Congress somehow gave the executive branch the power to crack down on carbon emissions it didn't so he's going to stop that which is great he's going to maybe issue an executive order barring the EPA from overruling federal permit decisions unless in clear violation of established law also a good thing and unless major reforms of the agency's use of science and economics are achieved EPA will be able to return to its bad old ways the establishment administration takes office so they want to destroy the EPA's ability to twist science in order to push a leftist agenda all of this is really really good stuff so good for Donald Trump on all of this this is really excellent ok now it's time for some some bad Trump so unfortunately I gave you the bad Trump face when I meant to go Trump face but here's a bad Trump it so Donald Trump here's here's some here's some bad Trump and this is the stuff that I think is more controversial because it pre stages a split in the Republican Party all the stuff we've talked about so far there is unanimity among conservatives that this is good stuff and cutting down the EPA to size cutting down regulations to size the Mexico City policy all of this there's broad consensus among conservatives across the spectrum that this is good and this is smart and this is stuff that we care about and then we get to the stuff that Donald Trump actually cares about the most the stuff that Donald Trump actually cares about the most is the trade stuff right because he is a populist nationalist and that here's the part of the Trump agenda that is helping transform the GOP from a traditionally conservative party based on the Reagan idea of limited government based on the idea of social conservatism based in the idea of hawkish foreign policy this is the part of Trump's agenda that really has very little to do with conservatism at all and we start actually with something that I think a lot of Trump's most ardent advocates were pushing him for but he's apparently now no longer going to do so apparently Donald Trump he let's let's just flash back here for a second Donald Trump promised and a lot of Republicans pushed Republican legislators to do this in 2014 Republicans promised they were going to get rid of Barack Obama's executive amnesties that they were going to reinstate the idea that if you are here illegally there's the potential for your deportation Barack Obama signed two executive orders the deferred action on childhood arrivals program that offered action on parents of those children those were his two big executive actions with regard to illegal immigration and Donald Trump lest you forget promised openly throughout the campaign then on day one he was going to get rid of daca and DAPA here was Donald Trump back in September saying exactly that cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforced immigration laws we will immediately terminate President Obama to illegal executive amnesty in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give em natee - approximately 5 million illegal immigrants 5 major and how about all of the millions that are waiting online going through the process legally so unfair so Donald Trump said that way back in September now here's what happened yesterday Sean Spicer came out and he said this is not a top priority he said we're not going to get rid of these executive amnesties excuse me we're going to leave them in place we're going to make sure that we pass some legislation that fixes the whole thing more basically going to leave them in place that was not his pitch during the campaign and here is the problem what this now creates is more of a magnet to drive people north of the border which is what Trump contended during the entire campaign Mark Krikorian who's a big Trump advocate he's at the Center for Immigration Studies his big piece up and National Review today talking about the fact that this is actually a big walk back by Trump this is Mark Krikorian politicians will always disappoint you rich tells the story of how during the few hours he was considering a run for New York City Mayor he found himself already starting to waffle on principle to a potential voter in the elevator if I were ever so unwise this to run for office I too would no doubt disappoint those who unwisely voted for me I was fully prepared for the Trump administration to do some things I wouldn't be happy with but I expected the problems to arise in the area of foreign worker visas the president while running for the nomination made lots of statements about that what I did not expect was for Trump to break an explicit promise regarding his headline issue on the administration's first business day in office but that may be what's happened and then he quotes exactly what we just showed he said immediately terminating the program wouldn't necessarily have required an executive order nor would require rounding up and deporting Dacus ice has enough to do already but ice right the Citizenship and Immigration Services which handles the two-year renewable amnesty program could easily have stopped stopped processing daca applications both for renewals and first-time applicants until further notice but that has not happened instead USCIS said we are still accepting and processing daca requests under existing policy so the way daca works is you send a paper into the government hey I'm here illegally and now action on you is deferred Trump could have paused that program he's not right now there are 800 illegal aliens receiving work permits during the first business day of the Trump administration and despite the fact that suspending the daca program would simply require a memo to the USCIS it's at least possible that this is a snafu there wasn't that much of a campaign infrastructure there's time to do this still or it could be or it could be that Reince Priebus and company were able to convince Donald Trump that it's politically unpopular to get rid of daca and to target the quote unquote dreamers and so Trump is leaving that in place so that is bad Trump that is not a good thing other stuff that is bad Trump so you remember the Donald Trump promise and he's been promising for weeks that they were going to move the Israeli embassy the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem here is Sean Spicer yesterday doing his press conference basically suggesting that this is not going to happen we are at the early stages in this decision-making process not whether it's when and how high there's a reason you go through a decision-making process and that's what we're in the process of starting right now okay so when they say they're at the beginning of the decision-making process there's no decision-making process either do it or you don't you promised he was going to do it he's not doing it that is a walk back so that's that's other bedroom I think the biggest bad Trump is something that is very controversial among Republicans and that is this free trade stuff so as you know I'm an ardent advocate of free trade basically because free trade makes people on both sides of the trade better off now there may be people who are disadvantaged by a free trade namely the people who are not competitive in a global market and those are the people that Trump is pandering to so yesterday Donald Trump issues right to a memo basically saying that he's going to revoke TPP right he signed an order withdrawing the United States from TPP and he said that this order was dedicated to the working man right this is this is the way that he phrased this it was dedicated to the working man and this is part of his broader anti-free trade anti capitalism free trade is just part of capitalism folks if you don't believe that free trade is part of capitalism I suggest to boycott every business with which you actually do business because you want to make yourself richer it's not going to work Donald Trump told business leaders today that they have to make their products here or suffer a big border taxes clip 15 if we can play that the one thing I do have to warn you about when you have a company here you have a plant here it's going to be in Indiana or ohayo or it's in Michigan or it's in North Carolina or Pennsylvania do you have 50 great wonderful governor's to negotiate with so it's not like we're taking away competition but if you go to another country and you decide that you were to close and get rid of two thousand people or five thousand people I tell United Technologies was an example with carrier and I got involved you know two years after they announced Oh in all fairness that was tough but United Technologies was terrific and they brought back many of those jobs lucky VP and he wants to kill TPP now I've said the TPP should be renegotiated because Obama negotiated the thing and Obama had all sorts of secret clauses apparently that contains a bunch of provisions that Americans don't like it should be subject to Senate approval it shouldn't be the sort of situation where the president just gets to go sign a big trade treaty the Senate should have to actually approve it I believe in how the Constitution was meant to work those are procedural and content aspects of the TPP I don't like Trump is just pulling us out here is why this is silly what this ends up doing China was not a party to the TPP Trump says run competition with China trade makes the people who are involved in trade better off so instead of us now having a big regional trading bloc in the in the Pacific now China is stepping in and China is now trying to create a reverse TPP with all of the countries that we were trying to create a free trade agreement with so we killed our own free trade agreement in favor of bilateral trade agreements which are harder to negotiate and organize in certain ways and don't create these vast free trading swaths instead now we have to negotiate with Philippines and now we have to negotiate with Korea and I have to negotiate with each one of these places bilaterally they have less interest in doing that than they would in being able to have access to ten markets just having access to one market China is extremely happy today so really you'll get what the Chinese newspapers are saying and they are ecstatic about Donald Trump getting rid of TPP the other group of people who are a static about Donald Trump getting rid of TPP with no plan to replace it really the other group of people are union leaders now I'm old enough to remember when Republicans were skeptical of union leaders like Richard Trumka and the people the UAW and all these various unions that had signed bad union contract and help the bankrupt American business I'm old enough to remember when that was a problem but now these Union folks are coming out and praising Trump to the skies and the Republicans are yeah that's great now the unions are on our side well the question is what did you have to give up to get the union's on your side what you had to give up was the American consumer well you had to give up with some points of growth in the American economy well you have to do is sacrifice certain interest to the interests of Union so now we're pandering to unions in the same way the Democrats pander to unions Democrats Panzer to unions by using the National Labor Relations Board in order to cram down bad deals on companies and Republicans pander to unions with massive tariffs and with anti trade regulations that allow unions to make a buck off the American taxpayer without actually creating a better product here's the union leaders out there yesterday praising Trump three million of our members in the United States was nothing short of incredible and we will work with him and his administration to help them implement his plans on infrastructure trade and energy policy so that we really do put America back to work in the middle class jobs that our members and all markings are demanding thank you very much and our people are saying yeah win-win-win because all the union leaders are on our side yeah except for the fact that these union leaders are what made American business non-competitive in the first place in many ways which is leading to these tariffs which are impoverishing American consumers you want to know why carrier shifted jobs down south is because a bad union contract it wasn't because of global competition as much as it was because of those bad union contracts Trump is helping out those unions but he's not helping out the American consumers I know there are a lot of people on our side who care more about winning than they do about you know basic principles but the fact is that winning requires you to win on behalf of a principle so I'm not sure what principle it is that that Trump is standing for on this one again the reason that it's good from bad Trump is because he's doing some good stuff and he's doing some bad stuff this is just the thing he's doing that he's shifting the Republican Party in the nature of it we'll talk more about the shift in the Republican Party in the nature of the Republican Party we have to we have to quit Facebook right now I
