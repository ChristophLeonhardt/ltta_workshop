hello there I'm Rob trim shock take a look around the institutions in your life it seems like from government to Silicon Valley from star-studded Hollywood to the media on your every device there's a slow but steady push for equality of outcome over equality of opportunity a prioritization of feelings over facts and a general humorless nough Stelling us what to think instead of how to think but what started this creeping cultural Marxism what do most of the thought leaders behind these institutions have in common if you answered university you've done your homework the ivory tower has long been a place of left-wing bias but the 12 to one left-wing to right-wing professor ratio hasn't just spawned a lopsided curriculum it's instead created an intolerance for opposing points of view that manifests in lies censorship and at its most extreme violence attitudes and systems cultivated in academia have a long history of seeping into the world outside but this intolerance seems a bit more insidious than the ingenious strides in stem and literature of years past do we dare let the wound fester and spread it's time to shine a light on the Cowardly tactics of those who can't win wars with words it's time to expose the assassins of truth who brand Israel responsible for Isis and all frat boys as rapists it's time to bring justice to the Antiqua hordes terrorizing those who dare commit wrong thing it's time for a campus unmasked
