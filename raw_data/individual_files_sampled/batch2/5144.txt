after the 9/11 terror attacks many Americans were terrified about what was coming next but for the intelligence and law enforcement community moving forward required looking back at the rivalries within the CIA and FBI before the attacks Lawrence Wright won a Pulitzer Prize for his book about the lead-up to 9/11 that book the looming tower has been adapted into a series premiering on hulu this wednesday you got a stash of intel that you refused to share with my agents still looking at if we were in possession of such a computer and i'm not confirming that we are it would be a foreign intelligence matter not a law enforcement matter so you do have the hard drive i don't know how you reach that how would you know if it was a law enforcement matter of foreign intelligence matter if you haven't looked at the hard drive jeff daniels and peter sarsgaard play the FBI and CIA agents at the center of the drama they sat down to talk with Chuck Todd about their new series it's amazing to me that among the first you know episodes you guys deal with in this in this 10 episode deal is this idea that bin Laden's about to do an interview with ABC and this was happening bin Laden was an undercover dish ooh in person in our news media in the late 90s because we were focused on another story yes you were Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky how much did you learn Jeff and Peter that you realize you didn't know just as American citizens of all of it I didn't know any of it I knew nothing about the turmoil between the CIA and the FBI both of them thought they were right I knew I didn't know John O'Neil was I had no idea what you know about some of it laden people in the late 90s other than like my character but like yeah I feel like I had some knowledge of it man I'm in New Yorker and we had the first World Trade Center bombing in the Hajj so it was a name I knew but you know nothing like we know it now that was O'Neill's problem was that he kept pounding people and you got to pay attention to this guy oh he's just some guy in a tent in Afghanistan what are we worried about he'll kept hearing that some of these movies you get you have outside consultants any former FBI or CIA work with you guys on yeah a lot of help from a lease upon himself and John's partners what do you think they will think of it when they see all 10 episodes well they feel as if it's too tough on the FBI or the CIA or fair what what do you think their reaction sounds on perspective you know who's where but yeah I mean I'm sure everyone will I'm sure everyone will feel both maligned and supported you know at various parts you know we're not out to support any one agency or any one point of view what are we supposed to take away what do you want the viewer to take away divided we fail and that's what this that's to meet you let's you the message of this I I think I know our task questions right so so the question is I mean this this happened because we were divided are we supposed to get the sense that if these two guys had worked together better they would have stopped 9/11 yeah is that the is that what we're supposed to take away from this it could be argued it asks that question yeah you went right there you said ask the question yeah I mean I feel like when you look at the information that the CIA had I mean the thing with the CIA at that point is like if you share that information with the FBI they might go out and arrest everyone that you're going to want to track well in this this is always the challenge with intelligence how much illegality let happen in order to learn more sure yeah right I mean that's the trade-off yeah and you learn things from people who are the bad guys a lot of the time you know it's the the person who's turned and says you know the terrorist who comes in and says I'd like to share information and those are the people all right let me ask you guys about the me to movement how has it changed I've talked to a lot of folks in Hollywood over the last six months and I'm just here in an overtime it's like incremental how would you say that things have changed in Hollywood I think it's it's revolutionary times about a lot of things and that is right in there fully supportive absolutely fully so you notice a difference just on sets yet I don't know you know I I have around that crap I wasn't around it Woody Allen films where are you on this there's some factors that are saying a couple things I think you both appear didn't Woody Allen done somebody Alan hmm some are given their money back some say they'll never appear in a Woody Allen film where are you guys on this I mean III get that this is art its art this line here of what's art when do you leave somebody's politics or personality whatever however you want to do it where are you guys almost that's such a complicated question I mean I believe people when they say you know I was assaulted or I was molested or something like that because I don't think you really have any other choice because if we start not believing people it's a slippery slope so you know that's the hard part is why would they make it up why would they want to put themselves yeah that's not always fair why would they want to label the whole thing they say that it's very very rare that somebody makes something like that up but you know so you know I I would rather you know err on that side I know that says that made use of you would think twice before taking another part in a Woody Allen movie I've already done it Woody Allen movie right you know but we should do another know about you Jeff that was hard it's a difficult decision because of Purple Rose of Cairo that movie will always be a great experience a great movie for me and he will always be a great American filmmaker and I got to work with him at the age of 30 and it changed my life he is a fan tell of that I think all of that and I believe Dylan Farrow so now I do another one with woody yeah the difficult decision would be to turn him down because of Purple Rose throughout history there are in so many artists that have bad behavior Picasso I mean my god it's just been one after another right and on all professions but a lot of art and it's always been accepted more an artists like oh they're the eccentric alcoholic yeah because you're you well they're artistic you know eccentric but obviously there's some behavior that isn't yeah I mean I would continue to watch Woody Allen movies that you know I would go back and watch some of those movies I mean he's a fantastic filmmaker Jeff
