1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
You know the song Lemon right? It's
amazing. I mean Rihanna raps on it like a badass.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,300
You can catch me, Ri, in the new La Ferrar'

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,320
and the music video is incredible
Rihanna shaves dancer Metta Towley's head,

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,100
right before she goes on to dance under
saturated neon lights for the rest of

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,619
the video. And the more I listen to it
the more there was something about its

6
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,869
sound that just felt super familiar and
the fact that I couldn't pinpoint why

7
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,320
was driving me crazy. And then one day it
just clicked.

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,910
Lemon sounds a lot like a

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,460
New Orleans Bounce song.

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,040
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'.

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,680
Now if you don't know
what New Orleans bounces then you're in

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,140
for a treat, because I have the perfect
person to help explain it. It's something

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,080
that moves in your bones, moves in your
body, and it moves in your soul.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,020
That's Big Freedia, the unofficial but
let's just say official, ambassador of

15
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,480
New Orleans bounce.

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,430
In New Orleans we take any song, it can be from a BeyoncÃ© song,

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,659
to a Rihanna song, to a Drake song. It
can be Patti LaBelle. It could be a

18
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,220
church song. They will take it and put
a bounce beat on it honey.

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,460
To understand bounce music you have to go back to the
late 1980s and early 90s. It was the

20
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,990
Golden Age of hip hop and rap's biggest
hits were coming from the east and west

21
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,159
coast. In New Orleans though, a rap scene
was just starting to form and while

22
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,180
artists were trying to find their voice
and identity, they were also competing

23
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,520
with the likes of Snoop Dogg and Run DMC
on the local radio stations. So they had

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,320
to come up with ways to get the city's
attention.

25
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,160
You know the baseline in the background
baby. New Orleans. Rapper Gregory D and producer

26
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,299
Mannie Fresh figured out that winning
strategy with Buck Jump Time.

27
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,900
Listen to the rhymes back-to-back
that I wrote for the project rap.

28
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,980
This rap is wild, a number one hit.
When you ever heard a rapper bust like this?

29
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,000
Uptown, Third Ward, that Calliope
Melpomene, Magnolia, the home of dope.

30
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,420
St. Thomas, Lafitte, the Iberville's hard
And that Seventh Ward St. Bernard.

31
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:15,180
All those chants are shout outs to different housing projects in the city. And in 1989 and it made

32
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,680
Buck Jump Time an instant local hit.

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,110
You got to represent the people. That's the

34
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,650
people who're going to talk about these songs,
that's the people who're going to play the

35
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,220
songs, that's the people who're going to shake
their ass, that's the people who're going to feed

36
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,260
the music where it needs to be fed.

37
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,500
Buck Jump Time is a progenitor to bounce, but

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,549
they quickly solidified emotional
appeals to the people of New Orleans as

39
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:39,780
one of the earliest conventions of the
genre.

40
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,640
It's not only the lyrics that were

41
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,900
so catchy, but it's the beat. The beat
that got everybody on their feet.

42
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,080
That's the "Trigger Man" beat.

43
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,260
And you might have heard it before in songs like

44
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,180
BALL by T.I.,

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,860
Or Trigger Man by Lil' Wayne.

46
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,320
You know where I hear it?
Lemon.

47
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,920
Trigger Man definitely has a

48
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,160
strong point in the sound of Bounce music.

49
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,180
You know, when you hear dun dun dun dun.

50
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,060
You know, "the rhymes you're about to hear are true."

51
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,700
It's just like, it's so magical to the culture

52
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,430
of New Orleans. The funny thing is the
Trigger Man beat wasn't created in New Orleans,

53
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,709
it was created by the rap duo
The Show Boys in Queens, New York and it

54
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,370
was originally called Drag Rap, because
they sampled sounds from the

55
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,180
detective show Dragnet.

56
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,760
Ladies and Gentlemen, the
story you're about to see is true the

57
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,560
names have been changed to protect the
innocent.

58
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,080
The song was made around 1986.

59
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,549
It barely got any radio airplay in New
York, and soon after The Show Boys

60
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:11,370
disbanded. But somehow this record ended
up in New Orleans and the city loved it.

61
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,160
In the words of Lil Wayne: "In 1990 you
play it,  people will go bananas. You play the

62
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,400
song right now 2011, in New Orleans
people will go bananas. We took that song

63
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,100
and we fell in love with it man.

64
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,080
Lil Wayne, what type of food do you like?

65
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,460
Okay - back to the story. People in New Orleans

66
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,090
loved the Trigger Man beat on its own, but
when M.C.T. Tucker used it on his 1992

67
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,030
track "Where dey at", there was no going
back.

68
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,720
Bounce was born.

69
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,000
When M.C.T. Tucker chanted f***
David Duke over the Trigger Man beat, he

70
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,760
knew he had the city behind him, but he
also introduced one more thin: hyper

71
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,580
repetitive dance instructions.

72
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,120
Shake that ass like a saltshaker.

73
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,840
You know, it's all about stuff that's commanding
your audience on what to do. Either

74
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,500
lyrically, or dance-wise you know, like dribble

75
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,320
dribble dribble dribble like a basketball

76
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,700
There's this billboard magazine feature
from 1994 about Bounce, that explains

77
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,940
just how popular it was in New Orleans.
It says locally-produced Bounce

78
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,370
cassettes routinely sell 200 to 300
units a week, roughly 10 times the sales

79
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:56,729
of national rap albums. The problem? Well,
Bounce was difficult to sell outside of

80
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:00,990
New Orleans, because they just didn't
match the sound or the lyrical style of

81
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,000
mainstream hip hop. And yet, Bounce
persisted in the city and eventually the

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,020
Trigger Man beat was mixed up with the
brown beat, an 808 heavy syncopated

83
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,310
rhythm that, depending on who you ask was
either lifted from UK rapper Derek P's

84
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,160
Rock The Beat,

85
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,780
or from this Bay Area DJ. Hi I'm
Cameron Paul.

86
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,000
You know, something about Bounce?

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,220
It never gets old.
A lot of us have classics that they know

88
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,570
when they hear that, the whole club just
gonna go damn crazy. You can put a DJ

89
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:43,040
Jubilee song on and the party's just
gonna get started.

90
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,260
Big Freedia's classic? Everybody know me
for Gin In My System for sure.

91
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:00,050
It's definitely about participation with New
Orleans. The Mardi Gras Indians, the

92
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,910
Second Line Sundays, the Bounce music
where if I would say I got that gin in

93
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:10,040
my system, my audience will say somebody
gonna be my victim. And that's your

94
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,300
hook. I got that gin in my system
somebody gonna be my victim.

95
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,460
For the most

96
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,520
part the Big Bounce classics stayed in
New Orleans, but a few trickled into the

97
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,960
mainstream. Like in 1998 New Orleans' own Juvenile
released Back That Azz Up

98
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,200
featuring Lil Wayne. It peaked at 19 on
the Billboard charts.

99
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,660
Just like any of the music around the
world, it has to have his home base first.

100
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:53,200
Once Katrina hit, the music spread all around the world, wherever we were

101
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,130
displaced at. And people was like what
is that sound? What type of music is that?

102
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,920
And we was like baby that's New Orleans
Bounce.

103
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,750
Sometimes that exposure fosters

104
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,620
positive collaborations with bigger
artists. Diplo worked with New Orleans

105
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,900
Nicky DA B on Express Yourself and Big
Freedia on Drop.

106
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,320
And other times is just

107
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,440
blatant appropriation.

108
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,790
It's just important for them to say whether they

109
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:20,080
get the idea, and having the courage to
say I got this from the culture of

110
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,820
Bounce music. A lot of times people come
to New Orleans and they see it and they

111
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,590
love it so much, they just gotta take a
little piece back home with them baby.

112
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,980
But there is a gray area in songs like
Lemon.

113
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,360
When I listen to Lemon, I hear a

114
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,380
very clear remix of the Trigger Man beat.

115
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,740
I hear a heavily syncopated Brown . beat style rhythm.

116
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,040
I hear dead giveaway lyrics,

117
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,180
And some subtle nods to the genre.

118
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,904
Based on this though, is it Bounce or is it just
Bounce-inspired?

119
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:21,930
Well I definitely

120
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,770
think that it's Bounce inspired. It's
definitely not a Bounce song. A lot of

121
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:32,820
artists sometimes, can instruct producers
to a certain degree on how to create the

122
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,800
sound. When its the official stamp of a Bounce song, you are a Bounce artist, you

123
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,940
grew up in New Orleans, and you went into
one of our gritty little studios that

124
00:09:41,940 --> 00:00:00,000
was sweating hot and you made that song.
