amazing news story out of the intercept written by Jeremy Scahill and Matthew Cole now it starts with an interesting fact about the current FBI director but it's mainly a story about Eric Prince and his company frontier and the deal is they have with foreign countries and what they have sold of our military technology to those countries so they explain as a private attorney in 2016 the FBI director Chris Rea supervised a team of lawyers that inform the Justice Department that Blackwater founder Eric Prince had likely violated US law while trying to sell secretly modified paramilitary attack aircraft the other by John's military hmm now I want to go through all the countries that he has betrayed us to for money let's note for the record I don't mind and I don't care which country it happened to me I don't want it to be any country but the right-wingers tell me that Muslims are particularly dangerous and I know that their fact challenged so let me inform you that Azerbaijan is a Muslim country so he's taking our secrets and selling it for profit potentially illegally as you're about to find out to a Muslim country you guys okay with that I mean I don't know the right wing's the one that's uh and prince is like yeah but am i making money off of it what do I care about America you know he doesn't even live in the country he took up residence in Abu Dhabi another Muslim area if you're not aware okay now his front his group front here it's also referred to as FSG retained the law firm can Spaulding to conduct a review of the company's legal exposure to violations of US law and weapons sales and export of death and defense services to foreign governments and militaries the attorneys conclude that Prince could potentially be charged with brokering defense articles without a license according to a copy of the review obtained by the intercept again great reporting here now at the time Greg Smith was the CEO of this company FSG and he said the potential violation stem principally from the conduct of mr. prince a u.s. person okay now what are those violations well violations of international traffic in arms regulations can trigger civil penalties of up to half a million dollars or criminal penalties of up to 20 years in prison depending on the specific nature of the violations you want to chat with me guys lock him up lock him up 20 years 20 years okay an internal investigation by his own company said the evidence strongly suggests that mr. Prince was offering a foreign defense article ie an attack aircraft for sale to other by John a Modi oops now they his own company had looked into this obviously there was internal disagreements about what whether they should be doing illegal things like this the CEO didn't want to in this case Greg Smith Erik Prince led those efforts so the lawyers were hired at King & Spalding they seem to confirm what was happening and then they turn it over to the to the US government at some points let me give you more details the 2015 internal report by FS G's lawyers from King of Spalding concluded that quote based on the information available it appears likely that mr. Prince engaged in brokering activities without the necessary approval from the US in connection with attempted sale of the secretly modified paramilitary aircraft the author by Jones Ministry of Defence so did the Justice Department do anything about it now for progressives brace for impact because this is really frustrating what action if any of the Justice Department took after Ray's team shared their initial findings has not been made public quote we were perplexed by the lack of immediate action by state and Justice Department's the former senior FSG official told the intercept adding that he and others at the company got the impression that quote nobody wanted to dig into this until after the 2016 election so the Justice Department under Obama was like Oh Eric Chris's own company has turned him in saying he is quote likely doing significantly illegal acts selling our technology to foreign countries for money like that's a 20-year prison sentence if he's caught oh don't worry Hillary Clinton will win and she'll deal with it let's not do anything until after the election oops Donald Trump wins Eric Prince and his family have given a tremendous amount of political donations to Donald Trump now all sudden Eric Prince is free to go not only that he's lobbying to start start a mercenary army a private army within the Pentagon that would report to Eric Prince Trump pushed for it now they didn't get that in any of the legislation but they did get a private intelligence sector set up within the US government that has been privatized our intelligence community a part of it has been privatized and and that was one of the things that Eric Prince was pushing for by the way Eric Prince's sister that's he divorced the current education secretary so it looks like if you want to build a swamp you know you just go give money to Donald Trump and then when he wins office you don't have to worry about rule of law in the more rule of law you don't have to suffer any consequences all your legal problems go away all of a sudden your sister becomes a cabinet secretary you go have meetings with the Russians and seashells island and other controversies surrounding Eric Prince but he's not done selling us out just to asar bhaijaan they also point out on Sunday Prince and Oliver North's speaking of traders of iran-contra Fame hosted a fundraiser princes home in Virginia for his longtime friend California Republican representative Dana Rohrabacher in a Rohrabacher known as Putin's favorite congressman if you think trumps over the top in his praise of of bought Amir Putin you should get a little Rohrbacher so these guys who claim to be patron whoever's got money Putin Rohrbacher the Gulf countries African countries ah sir bhaijaan who cares they'll take your money and sell out America and our secrets okay but we have still not got nicely to the number-one problem soon after Smith reporter princes potential violations to the State Department Smith was forced out of the company and Prince and his Chinese business partners consolidated power savez tried to do the right thing and follow the law telling do you know what we do we're mercenaries no you're fired no we do not accept good guys I don't know if you heard that as we were hiring no only bad guys here at frontier so now that's part of it but the most important part was the end there wait did they say business partners they're from China well are they private are they stayed on let's find out at the time Prince was being investigated by US law enforcement and his communications were being monitored what began as an investigation into Prince's attempts to sell defense services in Libya by the way another Muslim country and other countries in Africa widened to include allegations that Prince received assistance from Chinese intelligence to set up an account for his Libya operations through the Bank of China so Eric Prince is working with the Chinese to help governments in the Middle East and Africa and places like Azerbaijan maintain themselves maintain their power crush the opposition get access to US military goods that they are not supposed to have access to but is it alone by the Chinese government let's find out F s G's single largest shareholder acidic group the Chinese government's largest state-owned investment firm siddik which recently invested another sixty million dollars in FSG is the company's largest single shareholder Eric Prince literally were for the Chinese government and this is the guy that is being trusted to run either a private army or private intelligence agency within the US government I can't imagine a larger violation of national security so his secret dealings with the Russians and seashells island and the fund raisers for their favorite congressman seem like peanuts compared to this even giving other by John military goods that they're not supposed to have that are unauthorized I mean that's a 20-year sentence that is my penis that is a significant issue but to do this at the behest of the Chinese government to give away our defense goods to us or bhaijaan because China told you to to say that they are not patriots is the the greatest understatement you could have they don't care about America at all all they care about is money and they will sell us out and have apparently already sold us out
