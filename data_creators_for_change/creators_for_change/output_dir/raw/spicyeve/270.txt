your best<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends are your best friends</font>

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,090
feel good inside you enjoy their company

18

none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things go with study none</font>

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,870
of them we would hang out more in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

dorm or apartment a fridge probably a TV

24
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,729
most importantly your bed so the

25
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,060
temptation is there to just slip into

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,810
bed or even<font color="#CCCCCC"> worse figure and get away</font>

27
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,909
with taking your laptop into bed with

28
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,890
you and doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in bed it's not gonna</font>

29
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,920
work out for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I recommend going by</font>

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,500
yourself to the library or to a coffee

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,290
shop or something and getting work done

32
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,659
that way if you do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to study with</font>

33
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,450
someone a good idea to find someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

34
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,100
your class that you can team up with her

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,020
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> people granted these won't be</font>

36
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,850
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> BFFs for reasons that I talked</font>

37
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,770
about before but these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people that</font>

38
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,380
will kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of complement and supplement</font>

39
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,060
your not supplement what I sound like

40
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,820
that will supplement your knowledge you

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,049
guys can compare notes which notes um

42
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,420
talk about lectures you know you guys

43
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,820
can balance each other out another thing

44
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,180
I suggest is making a list writing down

45
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,700
everything you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cover I don't</font>

46
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,750
know if your professor<font color="#E5E5E5"> a teacher</font>

47
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,878
provided you with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> review or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a study</font>

48
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,340
guide but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,230
then you need to manually go back

50
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,730
through the syllabus and physically

51
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">write again every subject every topic</font>

52
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,010
that needs to be covered so it's easy

53
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,780
for you to knock stuff off your list

54
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,629
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of just a mad dash to just read</font>

55
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:27,120
everything because if you're like me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

56
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,129
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really read you realize that</font>

57
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:31,080
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get to everything so</font>

58
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">if your list is really long just</font>

59
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,080
realized that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do</font>

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,640
some skimming you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have to go</font>

61
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,890
through everything maybe once but if

62
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,420
your list is kind of short then you can

63
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,069
go a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in depth and really</font>

64
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:44,130
get some good studying in I cannot study

65
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,829
in complete silence because what i will

66
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:49,680
do is i will create noise tapping on the

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,829
table or making a beat in my head you

68
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,840
know beatboxing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my head it's</font>

69
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i will fill the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> silence</font>

70
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:58,590
because it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me really uncomfortable</font>

71
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,170
and it makes me fall asleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> because only</font>

72
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,959
time my world is ever under percent

73
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,480
silent is when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm asleep getting a good</font>

74
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,700
playlist up of music that you like

75
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,860
usually listen to music that has no

76
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,410
words because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be focusing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on doing</font>

77
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,180
the wraps you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm saying have you</font>

78
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,190
rack and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> drake and that doesn't</font>

79
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,450
really it's not really conducive to

80
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,220
study so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i usually turn on</font>

81
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,890
make a playlist set a goal a number of

82
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,080
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get accomplished</font>

83
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,480
in a day or in a couple of hours or

84
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,100
however long you're studying take it in

85
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">bite-sized pieces more you just jump</font>

86
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,990
dive into the mass of<font color="#E5E5E5"> material that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

87
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,970
need to study the more you will get

88
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,610
distracted discouraged and you'd rather

89
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,740
you know go downtown for drinks with

90
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,260
your friends instead of studying like

91
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,330
you should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> another tip if your</font>

92
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,209
professor has special office hours go to

93
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,430
them things because you never know what

94
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">the TA or the professor's gonna say that</font>

95
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,590
will give you a tip on a question that's

96
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> test you never know</font>

97
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,040
what another student is gonna ask and

98
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that answer will give you your answer</font>

99
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,660
and I never go to office hours regular

100
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,580
office hours you know every wednesday

101
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,860
