much of what he says is untrue people here are because these things are provably untrue they just they're just factually incorrect and people know the difference so I don't know why Lars himself to such a low low standard the basis our country in the way that he does but he does and you know like I don't like responding huh you know you can let them go unanswered but it's just not me we don't do tweets like that we've responded twice to again untruth but you know it's unfortunate that our nation finds itself in this place the president has great difficulty with the truthful on many issues he's proven himself unable to rise to the occasion I think many of us mean me included have you know tried to you know I've intervened I've had private dinner and with him on multiple occasions to try to you know create some kind of aspirational approach if you will to the way that he conducts himself but I don't think that that's possible and he's obviously not going to to rise to the occasion as president but I think at the end of the day when his term is over I think the the basing of our nation the constant non truth-telling the just the name-calling the things like I think the the basement of our nation will be what most for and that's regretful and it affects young people I mean we have young people who for the first time or you know watching a president stating absolute non truths non-stop personalizing things in the way he does and it's it's very sad for nation the shame of it is there are some really good people around them and if you would stay out of their way and let them perform people like Tillison and mattis and others you know we could really make progress
