DIFFERENCES IS THAT THIS IN A WAY ANSWERS A QUESTION THAT I

225
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:47,428
WAY ANSWERS A QUESTION THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD ABOUT WHAT WERE

226
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:48,863
HAVE ALWAYS HAD ABOUT WHAT WERE THEY THINKING ABOUT BREAKING

227
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:51,632
THEY THINKING ABOUT BREAKING INTO THE DNC DURING WATERGATE?

228
00:07:51,675 --> 00:07:53,167
INTO THE DNC DURING WATERGATE? WHAT DID THEY HOPE TO GET?

229
00:07:53,177 --> 00:07:55,636
WHAT DID THEY HOPE TO GET? WELL NOW WE HAVE SEEN WHAT THEY

230
00:07:55,646 --> 00:07:56,971
WELL NOW WE HAVE SEEN WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET IF

231
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:58,873
MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET IF THEY HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE

232
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:02,643
THEY HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THIS WAS A SUCCESSFUL BREAK-IN.

233
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:04,745
THIS WAS A SUCCESSFUL BREAK-IN. THEY GOT VERY DAMAGING DOCUMENTS

234
00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:07,348
THEY GOT VERY DAMAGING DOCUMENTS THAT THEY WEAPONIZED AND USED TO

235
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:09,450
THAT THEY WEAPONIZED AND USED TO HURT HILLARY CLINTON AND TO HELP

236
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,284
HURT HILLARY CLINTON AND TO HELP ELECT DONALD TRUMP.

237
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:12,486
ELECT DONALD TRUMP. THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED.

238
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,554
THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED. ONE DIFFERENCE, OF COURSE, IS

239
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:15,690
ONE DIFFERENCE, OF COURSE, IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO BROKE IN

240
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,258
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO BROKE IN WORKED FOR THE WHITE HOUSE AND

241

WORKED FOR THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE COMMITTEE TO RE-ELECT THE

247
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:30,204
WE HAVE NOW BEEN INVADED BY A FOREIGN ADVERSARY.

00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,978
THAT THE FIRST AND LAST THING THAT SHOULD BE DISCUSSED IN THE

252
00:08:36,988 --> 00:08:39,280
THAT SHOULD BE DISCUSSED IN THE MEETING WITH PUTIN, IF IT ISN’T

253
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,914
MEETING WITH PUTIN, IF IT ISN’T CANCELED, BUT IF IT GOES

254

259
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:54,496
THAT’S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT COMES IN THE SAME DAY THAT

00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:56,431
COMES IN THE SAME DAY THAT DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY ASKED

261
00:08:56,474 --> 00:08:57,966
DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY ASKED RUSSIA TO BREAK THE LAW IN THE

262
00:08:58,009 --> 00:08:59,534
RUSSIA TO BREAK THE LAW IN THE WAY THAT RUSSIA DID BREAK THE

263
00:08:59,544 --> 00:08:59,801
WAY THAT RUSSIA DID BREAK THE LAW.

264
00:08:59,811 --> 00:09:01,936
LAW. THE INDICTMENT SAYS THAT ON JULY

CAMPAIGN. THAT CAME AT THE END OF THE DAY

276
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:33,702
THAT CAME AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAID THIS.

277
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:36,171
WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAID THIS. >> I WILL TELL YOU THIS.

QUESTION THAT WE’RE ALL ASKING TONIGHT, LAWRENCE.

289
00:10:03,342 --> 00:10:05,700
TONIGHT, LAWRENCE. THIS IS WHAT PROSECUTORS CALL A

290
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:06,769
THIS IS WHAT PROSECUTORS CALL A SPEAKING INDICTMENT.

291
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:08,904
SPEAKING INDICTMENT. IT TELLS A NARRATIVE STORY

292
00:10:08,947 --> 00:10:10,606
IT TELLS A NARRATIVE STORY INSTEAD OF JUST RECITING THE

293
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:12,141
INSTEAD OF JUST RECITING THE ELEMENTS OF THE STATUTE.

294
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:14,276
ELEMENTS OF THE STATUTE. AND, SO, MUELLER HAD A LOT OF

295
00:10:14,286 --> 00:10:15,577
AND, SO, MUELLER HAD A LOT OF DISCRETION ABOUT THE LANGUAGE

296
00:10:15,587 --> 00:10:18,413
DISCRETION ABOUT THE LANGUAGE THAT HE CHOSE TO INCLUDE IN THIS

297
00:10:18,457 --> 00:10:20,181
THAT HE CHOSE TO INCLUDE IN THIS INDICTMENT, AND HE’S VERY

298
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:22,017
INDICTMENT, AND HE’S VERY DELIBERATELY SETTING THE STAGE

299
00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:23,919
DELIBERATELY SETTING THE STAGE HERE, MAKING SURE THAT NONE OF

300
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:26,088
HERE, MAKING SURE THAT NONE OF US COULD MISS THIS CONDUCT ON

301
00:10:26,098 --> 00:10:28,424
US COULD MISS THIS CONDUCT ON THE 27th WHERE HE NOTES THAT

302
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:31,260
THE 27th WHERE HE NOTES THAT RUSSIA HACKED THE DNC HACKED

303
00:10:31,303 --> 00:10:32,494
RUSSIA HACKED THE DNC HACKED CLINTON’S SERVERS FOR THE FIRST

304
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:34,029
CLINTON’S SERVERS FOR THE FIRST TIME TRYING TO GET THIS

305
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:34,796
TIME TRYING TO GET THIS INFORMATION THAT TRUMP ASKED

306
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:36,832
INFORMATION THAT TRUMP ASKED THEM TO GET FOR HIM ON THAT

307
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:37,132
THEM TO GET FOR HIM ON THAT DATE.

308
00:10:37,142 --> 00:10:39,267
DATE. AND, SO, I SUPPOSE MUCH LIKE

309
00:10:39,311 --> 00:10:40,536
AND, SO, I SUPPOSE MUCH LIKE WATERGATE, WE’RE BACK TO THIS

310
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:42,004
WATERGATE, WE’RE BACK TO THIS QUESTION OF WHAT DID THE

311
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,438
QUESTION OF WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT KNOW AND WHEN DID HE

312
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:44,240
PRESIDENT KNOW AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT?

313
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,909
KNOW IT? WAS IT JUST A RANDOM, LUCKY

314
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,244
WAS IT JUST A RANDOM, LUCKY CHANCE GUESS OF A QUESTION THAT

315
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:50,946
CHANCE GUESS OF A QUESTION THAT HE ASKED RUSSIA TO DO THIS?

316
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,414
HE ASKED RUSSIA TO DO THIS? OR HAD SOMEONE TOLD HIM THERE

317
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,450
OR HAD SOMEONE TOLD HIM THERE WAS A REALISTIC POSSIBILITY?

318
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:57,052
WAS A REALISTIC POSSIBILITY? YOU KNOW, LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLKS

319
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:59,821
YOU KNOW, LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLKS SAY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A

320
00:10:59,865 --> 00:11:01,824
SAY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A COINCIDENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT,

321
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,159
COINCIDENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, SO I GUESS MUELLER WILL HAVE

322
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:04,560
SO I GUESS MUELLER WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY ON THIS POINT.

323
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,129
MORE TO SAY ON THIS POINT. >> AND DAVID CORN, OF COURSE, NO

SPECIAL PROSECUTOR SAYS THAT NONE OF US HAD ANYTHING TO DO

THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS RELEASE ON IT SAID NOTHING ABOUT THE

IT SAID NOTHING ABOUT THE OUTRAGE OF WHAT THE RUSSIANS

356
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,519
BECAUSE IT SHOWS THERE WAS AN ATTACK BEING MOUNTED.

357
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:03,787
ATTACK BEING MOUNTED. IT IS NOT MEDDLING.

358
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,421
IT IS NOT MEDDLING. IT IS AN ATTACK ON THE UNITED

00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:06,523
IT IS AN ATTACK ON THE UNITED STATES POLITICAL SYSTEM

360

361
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:11,795
THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER OF 2016. WHILE THIS ATTACK WAS GOING ON,

362
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:12,629
WHILE THIS ATTACK WAS GOING ON, EVEN WHEN THERE WAS EVIDENCE

00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:32,215

00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,751
ALLEGEDLY RESPONDED TO IT. AND AT THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN

376
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:36,786
AND AT THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN THE LAST TWO MONTHS, TRUMP,

377
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,054
THE LAST TWO MONTHS, TRUMP, AFTER BEING BRIEFED THAT THIS

378
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:39,956
AFTER BEING BRIEFED THAT THIS ATTACK WAS UNDERWAY BY THE U.S.

379
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:41,591
ATTACK WAS UNDERWAY BY THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE IN AUGUST OF 2016,

380
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,226
INTELLIGENCE IN AUGUST OF 2016, STILL PUBLICALLY KEEPS SAYING

381
00:12:43,237 --> 00:12:44,327
STILL PUBLICALLY KEEPS SAYING AGAIN AND AGAIN, WE DON’T KNOW

00:12:44,337 --> 00:12:46,162
AGAIN AND AGAIN, WE DON’T KNOW IF IT’S THE RUSSIANS.

383
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:48,265
IF IT’S THE RUSSIANS. IT COULD BE THIS 400 POUND GUY.

384
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:51,568
IT COULD BE THIS 400 POUND GUY. AND, SO, THIS INDICTMENT TODAY

385
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:52,569
AND, SO, THIS INDICTMENT TODAY SHOWS WITHOUT QUESTION WHAT WE

00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:56,006
KNEW ALREADY, THIS ATTACK HAPPENED AND, YET, THE TRUMP

388
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:58,975
HAPPENED AND, YET, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TRIED TO COLLUDE WITH

00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:00,577
CAMPAIGN TRIED TO COLLUDE WITH RUSSIA WHILE THE ATTACK WAS

390
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,478
RUSSIA WHILE THE ATTACK WAS UNDERWAY.

391
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:03,080
UNDERWAY. TRIED TO FORM CONTACTS WITH

00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,748
TRIED TO FORM CONTACTS WITH RUSSIA WHILE IT WAS UNDERWAY,

393
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,383
RUSSIA WHILE IT WAS UNDERWAY, AND DENIED IT WAS HAPPENING.

394
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:08,051
AND DENIED IT WAS HAPPENING. THIS IS AIDING AND ABETTING AND

395
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:09,486
THIS IS AIDING AND ABETTING AND IT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE

396
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:15,659
IT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE IMPORTANT THAN A LOT OF THE

397
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,294
IMPORTANT THAN A LOT OF THE DISTRACTIONS AND DIEVERSIONS.

398
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:18,629
DISTRACTIONS AND DIEVERSIONS. YOU DON’T NEED FOR THE COLLUSION

399
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,297
YOU DON’T NEED FOR THE COLLUSION TO SAY THAT TRUMP BASICALLY MADE

400
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:22,499
TO SAY THAT TRUMP BASICALLY MADE COMMON CAUSE WITH A FOREIGN

401
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:25,102
COMMON CAUSE WITH A FOREIGN ADVERSARY AS IT ATTACKED THE

402
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:25,669
ADVERSARY AS IT ATTACKED THE UNITED STATES.

403
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:27,204
UNITED STATES. WHAT WORSE CAN YOU SAY ABOUT A

404
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:29,206
WHAT WORSE CAN YOU SAY ABOUT A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?

405
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:30,908
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? >> JILL, TALK ABOUT THE

406
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:31,675
>> JILL, TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU

407
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:33,811
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU WOULD NEED FOR A CRIMINAL

408
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:35,679
WOULD NEED FOR A CRIMINAL INDICTMENT AND A CRIMINAL

409
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,582
INDICTMENT AND A CRIMINAL CONVICTION IN COURT AND WHAT YOU

410
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:41,418
CONVICTION IN COURT AND WHAT YOU MIGHT PUT IN A BILL OF

411
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:42,653
MIGHT PUT IN A BILL OF IMPEACHMENT, PARTICULARLY IN

412
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,121
IMPEACHMENT, PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO WHAT WE JUST SAW THE

413
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:45,522
RELATION TO WHAT WE JUST SAW THE PRESIDENT DO.

414
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:46,656
PRESIDENT DO. CANDIDATE TRUMP STANDING UP

415
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,825
CANDIDATE TRUMP STANDING UP THERE INVITING THE RUSSIANS TO

416
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:51,795
THERE INVITING THE RUSSIANS TO COMMIT CRIME, TO COMMIT CRIME

417
00:13:51,806 --> 00:13:53,630
COMMIT CRIME, TO COMMIT CRIME AGAINST OUR DEMOCRACY, CRIME

418
00:13:53,641 --> 00:13:55,633
AGAINST OUR DEMOCRACY, CRIME THAT THEY ARE NOW CHARGED WITH.

419
00:13:55,676 --> 00:13:57,368
THAT THEY ARE NOW CHARGED WITH. DONALD TRUMP PUBLICALLY INVITED

420
00:13:57,411 --> 00:14:00,404
DONALD TRUMP PUBLICALLY INVITED THEM TO COMMIT THAT CRIME.

421
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:03,540
THEM TO COMMIT THAT CRIME. IS THAT THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR

422
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,142
IS THAT THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR THAT COULD FIND ITS WAY INTO A

423
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:06,610
THAT COULD FIND ITS WAY INTO A BILL OF IMPEACHMENT?

424
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:10,648
BILL OF IMPEACHMENT? >> IT CERTAINLY COULD BE GROUNDS

425
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:11,749
>> IT CERTAINLY COULD BE GROUNDS FOR IMPEACHMENT.

426
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,284
FOR IMPEACHMENT. IT IS ANY HIGH CRIME OR

427
00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:14,251
IT IS ANY HIGH CRIME OR MISDEMEANOR OR TREASON.

428
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:16,354
MISDEMEANOR OR TREASON. AND WORKING WITH A FOREIGN AGENT

429
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:18,289
AND WORKING WITH A FOREIGN AGENT OR A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT COULD

430
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:19,723
OR A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT COULD CERTAINLY BE ANY OF THOSE

431
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:20,858
CERTAINLY BE ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

432
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:23,027
THINGS. SO IT COULD BE FOR IMPEACHMENT.

433
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:24,762
SO IT COULD BE FOR IMPEACHMENT. BUT I THINK IT IS ALSO CLEAR

434
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:26,097
BUT I THINK IT IS ALSO CLEAR EVIDENCE OF A CRIME.

435
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,966
EVIDENCE OF A CRIME. I MEAN, DAVID IS COMPLETELY

436
00:14:28,976 --> 00:14:30,768
I MEAN, DAVID IS COMPLETELY CORRECT IN SAYING THAT THIS IS

437
00:14:30,811 --> 00:14:33,104
CORRECT IN SAYING THAT THIS IS AIDING AND ABETTING THE

438
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:34,372
AIDING AND ABETTING THE OBSTRUCTION OF OUR ELECTIONS.

439
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,607
OBSTRUCTION OF OUR ELECTIONS. THAT IS A CRIME.

440
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,074
THAT IS A CRIME. AND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IT.

441
00:14:37,118 --> 00:14:39,109
AND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IT. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE

442
00:14:39,153 --> 00:14:41,279
BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS WHO HAVE

443
00:14:41,322 --> 00:14:44,415
REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS WHO HAVE WASTED OUR TIME YESTERDAY IN AN

444
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:48,186
WASTED OUR TIME YESTERDAY IN AN ABSURD HEARING ATTACKING AN FBI

445
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:49,921
ABSURD HEARING ATTACKING AN FBI AGENT INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT HOW

446
00:14:49,964 --> 00:14:51,889
AGENT INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT HOW THEY CAN PREVENT FURTHER

447
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,392
THEY CAN PREVENT FURTHER INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS.

448
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:56,828
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS. WE HAVE CLEAR PROOF BEYOND A

449
00:14:56,871 --> 00:14:57,795
WE HAVE CLEAR PROOF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT OUR

450
00:14:57,805 --> 00:15:00,898
REASONABLE DOUBT THAT OUR ELECTIONS WERE HACKED, THAT

451
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,333
ELECTIONS WERE HACKED, THAT STATE ELECTION SYSTEMS WERE

452
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:04,802
STATE ELECTION SYSTEMS WERE VIOLATED AND THAT IT IS GOING TO

453
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:06,905
VIOLATED AND THAT IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN IN A FEW MONTHS.

454
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,907
HAPPEN AGAIN IN A FEW MONTHS. NOVEMBER IS JUST MONTHS AWAY.

455
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:11,343
NOVEMBER IS JUST MONTHS AWAY. AND CONGRESS HAS TO HARDEN OUR

456
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:11,976
AND CONGRESS HAS TO HARDEN OUR ELECTION SYSTEMS.

457
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:13,711
ELECTION SYSTEMS. THE STATES HAVE TO GET ACTIVE IN

458
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:14,011
THE STATES HAVE TO GET ACTIVE IN THIS.

459
00:15:14,022 --> 00:15:18,216
THIS. WE NEED TO PROTECT THE

460
00:15:18,226 --> 00:15:19,484
WE NEED TO PROTECT THE SANCTITY -- THE IMPORTANCE OF

461
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:21,820
SANCTITY -- THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR ELECTIONS AND PEOPLE NEED TO

OUR ELECTIONS AND PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT THEIR VOTE WILL COUNT

463
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:24,590
KNOW THAT THEIR VOTE WILL COUNT AS THEY CAST IT.

464
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,990
AS THEY CAST IT. AND WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THE

465
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,626
AND WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THE SOCIAL MEDIA WON’T BE USED TO

466
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:30,161
SOCIAL MEDIA WON’T BE USED TO CHANGE VOTES THINKING THAT IT’S

467
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:32,430
CHANGE VOTES THINKING THAT IT’S FROM AMERICANS INSTEAD OF FROM

468
00:15:32,441 --> 00:15:32,797
FROM AMERICANS INSTEAD OF FROM RUSSIANS.

469
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,932
RUSSIANS. SO IT IS ALL AIDING AND ABETTING

470
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:37,402
SO IT IS ALL AIDING AND ABETTING AND WE MUST GET BUSY ON THIS.

00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,795
>> WELL, HE DID. THE RETURN NEEDED TO BE MADE

00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:08,133
BUT, OF COURSE, THERE IS TIMING INVOLVED.

489
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:09,468
INVOLVED. BUT, LOOK, LAWRENCE, I HAVE

490
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,870
BUT, LOOK, LAWRENCE, I HAVE WORKED WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN FOR A

491
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,971
WORKED WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

492
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:14,339
NUMBER OF YEARS. HE’S A STRAIGHT ARROW.

493
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:17,276
HE’S A STRAIGHT ARROW. MY GUESS WOULD BE THAT HE LEFT

494
00:16:17,286 --> 00:16:19,778
MY GUESS WOULD BE THAT HE LEFT DESCRIPTION UP TO MUELLER’S TEAM

495
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:21,913
DESCRIPTION UP TO MUELLER’S TEAM ABOUT WHEN THIS CASE WAS READY

496
00:16:21,957 --> 00:16:23,982
ABOUT WHEN THIS CASE WAS READY TO INDICT AND SIMPLY REPORTED IT

497
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,017
TO INDICT AND SIMPLY REPORTED IT OUT AT THAT TIME.

498
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:27,753
OUT AT THAT TIME. HE IS NOT SOMEONE THAT BELIEVES

499
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:29,154
HE IS NOT SOMEONE THAT BELIEVES PROSECUTORS GET TO PLAY LOOSE

500
00:16:29,164 --> 00:16:29,655
PROSECUTORS GET TO PLAY LOOSE AND FAST.

501
00:16:29,665 --> 00:16:31,890
AND FAST. HE DOESN’T BELIEVE IN POLITICAL

502
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:33,892
HE DOESN’T BELIEVE IN POLITICAL STRATEGIES AND I THINK HE

503
00:16:33,935 --> 00:16:35,093
STRATEGIES AND I THINK HE REAFFIRMED THAT TODAY KNOWING

504
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:36,729
REAFFIRMED THAT TODAY KNOWING THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE LEAKING

505
00:16:36,772 --> 00:16:39,264
THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE LEAKING INFORMATION USUALLY ARE NOT

506
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:41,800
INFORMATION USUALLY ARE NOT FOLKS INVOLVED IN THE JUSTICE

507
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,768
FOLKS INVOLVED IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND HIS STRATEGY IS

508
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:43,969
DEPARTMENT AND HIS STRATEGY IS TO TRY THE CASES IN THE

509
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:46,104
TO TRY THE CASES IN THE COURTROOM AT THE APPROPRIATE

510
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:46,405
COURTROOM AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME.

511
00:16:46,415 --> 00:16:47,206
TIME. >> ONE MORE THING.

512
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,508
>> ONE MORE THING. ROD ROSENSTEIN SAID HE TOLD THE

513
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:51,910
ROD ROSENSTEIN SAID HE TOLD THE PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS BEFOREHAND

514
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:53,179
PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS BEFOREHAND THE LAST TIME HE COULD HAVE

515
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:55,114
THE LAST TIME HE COULD HAVE SPOKEN TO HIM IN PERSON WOULD

516
00:16:55,157 --> 00:16:55,681
SPOKEN TO HIM IN PERSON WOULD HAVE BEEN MONDAY.

517
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:56,682
HAVE BEEN MONDAY. BASED ON EVERYTHING YOU HEARD

518
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:58,017
BASED ON EVERYTHING YOU HEARD HIM SAY ABOUT THE WAY HE

519
00:16:58,027 --> 00:16:59,585
HIM SAY ABOUT THE WAY HE NOTIFIED THE PRESIDENT, DO YOU

520
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:00,686
NOTIFIED THE PRESIDENT, DO YOU BELIEVE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE

521
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:03,389
BELIEVE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT ON MONDAY, ANTICIPATE

522
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,124
TO DO THAT ON MONDAY, ANTICIPATE WHAT A GRAND JURY COULD DO ON

523
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:05,457
WHAT A GRAND JURY COULD DO ON FRIDAY?

524
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:06,592
FRIDAY? >> I THINK SO.

525
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:08,294
>> I THINK SO. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE LOVE TO SAY

526
00:17:08,304 --> 00:17:11,030
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE LOVE TO SAY THAT PROSECUTORS CAN INDICT A

527
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:11,998
THAT PROSECUTORS CAN INDICT A HAM SANDWICH.

528
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,199
HAM SANDWICH. I THINK THAT WHOEVER SIMPLIFIES.

529
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,001
I THINK THAT WHOEVER SIMPLIFIES. BUT IN THIS CASE THE GOVERNMENT

530
00:17:16,012 --> 00:17:19,004
BUT IN THIS CASE THE GOVERNMENT KNEW IT HAD MORE THAN SUFFICIENT

531
00:17:19,015 --> 00:17:21,307
KNEW IT HAD MORE THAN SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR A GRAND JURY TO

532
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:22,942
EVIDENCE FOR A GRAND JURY TO RETURN A TRUE BILL AND I WOULD

533
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:24,610
RETURN A TRUE BILL AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT MR. ROSENSTEIN WOULD

534
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,945
EXPECT THAT MR. ROSENSTEIN WOULD HAVE BRIEFED THE PRESIDENT

535
00:17:26,989 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE BRIEFED THE PRESIDENT WHENEVER THEY MET IN RETURN.
