a chipotle burrito cost the same as a burrito bowl but according to one Reddit user you can get up to twice as much food by ordering a burrito bowl with a tortilla on the side instead of a normal burrito we're going to put this theory to the test and see if you can really get more food to find out how much food is in a burrito and a burrito bowl we're first going to strip the burrito of its foil next we're going to dump the contents of the burrito out of the tortilla and into the bowl without the tortilla the contents of the burrito away 0.63 four pounds now it's time to weigh the burrito bowl when you subtract the weight of the burrito from the weight of the burrito bowl you end up with a difference of about 0.4 for 8 pounds that means that after you do the math you end up with 70 point 7 percent more food with the burrito bowl than with the burrito
