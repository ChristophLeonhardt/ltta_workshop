THANK YOU. HIGHER GAS PRICES RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT A POSSIBLE BACKLASH AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP. POLITICO WRITING, "THE INCREASED COST OF FUEL IS ALREADY WIPING OUT A BIG CHUNK OF THE BENEFIT AMERICA RECEIVERRED FROM THE G.O.P. TAX CUTS. THINGS COULD GET WORSE AS THE SUMMER APPROACHING FOLLOWING A STANDOFF WITH IRAN AND APPROVED TO TIGHTEN SUPPLIES." CHRIS STIREWALT, GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU. HOWDY,HAM. OWDY,HAM. DY,HAM. DY, MM. DY, MA'AM. WE LOOK AT THE FOUR-MONTH DIFFERENCE. TODAY'S PRICE IS $2.97, IT'S ALMOST $3.00. FOUR MONTHS AGO IN JANUARY $2.56. SO IF YOU ARE FILLING UP AN AVERAGE TANKS OF GAS, ABOUT 12 GALLONS YOU ARE PAYING FIVE BUCKS MORE OUT OF YOUR POCKET TO FILL UP THE TANK. IF YOU LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE I GREW UP, PEOPLE DRIVE A LONG WAY TO WORK OFTEN TIMES. FARTHER WEST YOU GO IN THE UNITED STATES FROM HERE IN THE OSCELLA CORRIDOR, THE DAYS AND THE COMMUTES ARE LONGER FOR PEOPLE IN THE METROPLEXES. NOW, WE DO KNOW THAT THE RUSSIANS AND THE SAUDIS ARE RETHINKING WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME IN REGARD TO INCREASED GAS PRICES. HOWEVER, WE KNOW FROM 2004, 2006 THERE IS A LOT OF POLITICAL HISTORY TO SUGGEST THAT THE HIGHER THE GAS PRICES ARE, THE WORSE IT IS FOR THE PARTY IN POWER. EVEN IF THERE IS NOTHING TO DO TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME AND IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT, VOTERS TAKE OUT FRUSTRATIONS ON WHAT PINCHES THE POCKETBOOK. AND NOTHING PINCHES IT MORE THAN GAS PRICES. Sandra: IT IS SOMETHING YOU SEE EVERY DAY AND YOU KNOW WHEN THEY ARE UP. WHAT DOES IT DO FOR REPUBLICANS RUNNING ON THE TAX CUTS? THE SAVINGS TO A MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY OF FOUR, WITH THE AVERAGE INCOME OF $85,000, WILL SAVE $2,250 ON THE 2018 TAXES. WELL, WITH THE HIGHER GAS PRICES YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE OVERALL GASOLINE EXPENDITURES OF ABOUT THAT MUCH IN 2018. THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE $2NA $2NA $2,300. I WOULD DEFER TO YOU ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMY BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR STUFF. BUT I THINK YOU BACK ME UP ON THIS. WE HAD A STAGNANT ECONOMY FOR GROWTH IN THE 2% RANGE. IT WAS SLOW-GOING. NOW WE ARE SEEING KICKED UP GROWTH. GALLUP FOUND TWO WEEKS AGO THAT AMERICANS WERE MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE CHANCES OF GETTING A GOOD JOB RIGHT NOW THEN THEY HAD BEEN SINCE TAKING THE MEASURE OVER THE PAST 17 YEARS. THERE IS GENERAL OPTIMISM. WHEN THE ECONOMY GETS BETTER, WHAT HAPPENS? INFLATION THAT HAD BEEN IN THE OFFING WHEN THINGS WERE FLATTER STARTS TO KICK IN. PRICES START TO RISE. AND PEOPLE FEEL THE PINCH. THE DOLLARS DON'T GO AS FAR. THAT IS ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES WHEN YOU GET FASTER GROWTH. WE'LL SEE WHAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE DOES. I GUARANTEE YOU THAT PAUL RYAN AND MITCH McCONNELL ARE LOOKING CLOSELY AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE ECONOMIC INDICATORS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE OVERALL HEALTH YES, GAS IS PART OF IT BUT THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE ECONOMY AND THE OVERALL COST OF WHAT WE CALL THAT, THE BASKET, THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX BASKET. Sandra: FOR GOOD, CHRIS STIREWALT. SEE, I PAID ATTENTION. Sandra: THE OLD ADAGE ON THE TRADING FLOOR "NOTHING CURES HIGH PRICES LIKE HIGH PRICES." WE ARE ALREADY GETTING TO THE LEVELS. WE ARE SEEING A HUGE CHANGE IN OIL. IT'S DOWN $3.00, ABOUT A 4% DROP. SO WE WILL SEE AND SOMETIMES THE HIGH PRICES ARE JUST A REFLECTION TO YOUR POINT OF A STRONG AND GROWING ECONOMY. I GOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT IVANKA TRUMP. OKAY. Sandra: WHAT IS HER FUTURE? WELL, SHE HAS A SECURITY CLEARANCE NOW. AND SO DOES HER HUSBAND. THEY SORT OF HAVE WAITED IT OUT. FOR A PERIOD, HER BROTHER DON JR. WAS THE POLITICALLY ATTENDANT ONE ON TRAIL. SHE IN THE END HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED BY THIS. SHE IS A LESS COMPLICATED FIGURE FOR THE FAMILY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. SHE IS BACK ON THE ASCENDSY AND BACK ON THE RISE. SHE CAN HELP IN THE DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE SHE IS GOING. SHE CAN HELP WHAT REPUBLICANS NEED VERY MUCH, WHICH IS OUTREACH TO EDUCATED, MORE AFFLUENT SUBURBAN WOMEN. THAT IS SOMETHING THEY WILL NEED IN A LOT OF DISTRICTS. Sandra: SHE HAS BEEN A CLEAR PRESENCE ALONGSIDE OF THE PRESIDENT. HE CLEARLY WANTS HER AND NEEDS HER BY HIS SIDE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LEFT WONDERING WHAT IS IVANKA TRUMP TEN YEARS FROM NOW, 20 YEARS FROM NOW? WHAT WILL HER ROLE BE IN WASHINGTON? I WISH I COULD SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN NOVEMBER. YOU CAN'T START ASKING ME ABOUT TEN YEARS FROM NOW. Sandra: C'MON, YOU KNOW
