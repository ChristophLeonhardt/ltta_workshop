so my name is Luke Harding I'm a journalist and a writer and my new book is called collusion and it's about Donald Trump and Russia Putin and money there are two taboo topic inside Russia I mean I write stories about this in 2007 based on sources inside this presidential administration who were saying quietly that he was worth about 40 billion dollars that was a decade ago the thing is you know Russia's a kleptocracy it's also the world's biggest oil producer and the people at the top of the Russian state are all kind of multi billionaires and Putin is that at the head of this pyramid although officially his salary is a hundred thousand dollars a year now everyone in the Russian elite knows he's the richest guy in town by a long way but the beauty of the system is that formerly nothing belongs to him and everything is held by proxy is some of whom are now under US sanctions it's a kind of clever system but of course he's enormously rich and for Putin the thing about money is it's kind of liquid power and power ultimately is what interests you
