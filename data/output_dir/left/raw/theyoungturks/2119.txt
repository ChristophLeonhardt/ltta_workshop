1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,140
OTHER THAN THAT WE HAD EIGHT
PRIMARY IN ILLINOIS.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,910
EVERY PRIMARY I COME TO TYT AND
WE WORK ON IT LIVE.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,379
WE HAD UNCORRUPTED DEMOCRATS
THAT DON'T TAKE ANY

4
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:15,990
CORPORATE MONEY.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,939
OF THE SEVEN,

6
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:21,870
310 RIGHT AND THEY WILL BE UP
AGAINST REPUBLICANS IN THE

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,900
GENERAL ELECTION, TWO WENT TO
THE RUNOFF, TO LOST SO FIVE OUT

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,870
OF SEVEN, NOT BAD AT ALL THAT IT
WAS A GOOD AND EXCITING NIGHT.

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,719
SOME OF THE CANDIDATES MOVED
INTO SECOND PLACE IN FIRST

10
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,270
PLACE AS THE NIGHT WORE ON DIED
IN ILLINOIS EARLIER THIS

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,739
WEEK IT DID NOT GO AS WELL.

12
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,030
THEY WERE FOR JUSTICE DEMOCRATS
UP INCLUDING THE MOST FAMOUS

13
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:51,300
Ã± IT WAS CLOSE.

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,149
DAN LIPINSKI IS A VERY
CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRAT.

15
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:58,149
HE IS ANTI-CHOICE AND WANTED TO
DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

16
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:04,650
NEWMAN GOT THE BACKING OF A SLEW
OF GROUPS THAT CARED ABOUT

17
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,799
PROGRESSIVES, BUT UNFORTUNATELY
SHE COULD NOT PULL IT OUT.

18
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,630
ALL FOUR OF THE JUSTICE
DEMOCRATS LOST.

19
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,610
DANIEL WAS A VERY STRONG
PROGRESSIVE.

20
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:28,549
HE ALSO LOST TO JAMIE PRITZKER.

21
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:32,110
UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THE TIMES
ESPECIALLY IN THE BIGGER

22
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,830
ELECTIONS THEY ARE NOT
ELECTIONS, THEY ARE AUCTIONS.

23
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:41,860
HE WILL BE GOING UP AGAINST
ANOTHER BILLIONAIRE WHO IS THE

24
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,930
CURRENT GOVERNOR.

25
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,659
IT WILL BE BILLIONAIRE ON
BILLIONAIRE CRIME IN THE GENERAL

26
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:49,340
ELECTION BUT PROGRESSIVES ARE
BLINKING THOSE CASES.

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,180
THERE BUT THERE IS GOOD NEWS
THAT CAME OUT OF ILLINOIS

28
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:12,240
FOR PROGRESSIVES.

29
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,800
YOU MIGHT THINK COME ON DUDE
YOU ARE STRETCHING THE

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,720
GOVERNOR'S RACE.

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:45,130
AND FIND OUT WHY THAT RACE IS SO
IMPORTANT.

32
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,910
THAT ONE STINGS.

33
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,780
WHEN YOU TOUCH THE MONEY PART OF
THE MACHINE THAT IS WHERE THEY

34
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,370
GET ANIMATED AND THAT IS WHY
THEY SPEND GOOD MONEY AND EFFORT

35
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:02,220
TRYING TO DEFEAT THE PROGRESSIVE
IN THAT CASE BUT THEY COULDN'T.

36
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:13,480
WHAT ARE 
THE RAMIFICATIONS

37
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,250
OF THAT?

38
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,630
WE HAVE SEEN WITH PEOPLE LIKE
LARRY KRASNER, THE DA IN

39
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,490
PHILADELPHIA SOMETIMES WHEN YOU
ELECT A PROGRESSIVE TO A

40
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,370
POSITION LIKE THAT IT MAKES ALL
THE DIFFERENCE.

41
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,290
IF THEY ACTUALLY CORRECTLY
ASSIST TAXES AND MAKE THE

42
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,150
RICH PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE IN
COOK COUNTY THAT CAN AFFECT

43
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,580
THEIR DONATIONS TO THOSE MACHINE
POLITICIANS.

44
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,360
BUT THE OTHER THING IS YOU WILL
ACTUALLY HAVE JUSTICE SERVE THE

45
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,130
POOR RESIDENTS IN THE MINORITY
RESIDENTS OF COOK COUNTY

46
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,640
ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES BEARING
ALL OF THE BURDEN WHICH MAKES

47
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,300
NO SENSE AT ALL ESPECIALLY IN AN
AREA CONTROLLED BY DEMOCRATS.

48
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,690
IF YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS LOOKING
OUT FOR DONORS, THEY ARE

49
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,770
NOT GOING TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU.

50
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,910
YOU HAVE PROGRESSIVES, THEY DO
LOOK OUT FOR YOU.

51
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:16,200
OUR REVOLUTION WAS A BIG PART OF
THE START.

52
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
THEY DID MAKE IT A
TOP

53
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:24,390
PRIORITY AND IT MADE ALL THE
DIFFERENCE.

54
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:44,680
LET ME GIVE YOU MORE CONTEXT
HERE.

55
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,340
THAT IS HOW THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE
SET THE STORY UP.

56
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,940
IT IS NOT MONDAY MORNING
QUARTERBACK IN GOD BEFORE THE

57
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,970
ELECTION PROGRESSIVE GROUPS THAT
IT WAS A TAX PRIORITY.

58
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,620
THE ESTABLISHMENT DEMOCRATS
WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO

59
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,760
PROTECT THAT MONEY.

60
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:10,700
IN THAT CASE THE PROGRESSIVE WON
THE TEST SO THAT IS INDEED

61
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,710
VERY GOOD NEWS.

62
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,840
BUT IT IS NOT THE ONLY GOOD
NEWS.

63
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:53,680
LET ME GIVE YOU THE REST.

64
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,550
INDEED VERY GOOD NEWS COMING OUT
OF ILLINOIS AS WELL.

65
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,050
WE WILL PUT THE LINK TO THE
INTERCEPT STORY DOWN BELOW

66
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,830
IN THE DESCRIPTION BOX.

67
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,820
READ IT FOR YOURSELF.

68
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,480
ILLINOIS, MIXED RESULTS
ADMITTEDLY, SOME

69
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,940
DISAPPOINTING LOSSES BUT SOME
SIGNIFICANT WINS AS WELL.

70
00:06:13,940 --> 00:00:00,000
ONTO THE NEXT PRIMARY WE GO.
