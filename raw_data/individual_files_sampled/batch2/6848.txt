DID YOU HEAR THEY SOLD TIME INC.? TIME INC. WHICH PUBLISHES TIME MAGAZINE, THIS IS AN INTERESTING ADDENDUM ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE MAGAZINE. WHEN TIME WARNER SPUN IT OFF FROM THE ORIGINAL TIME WARNER ENTITY IT BECAME ITS OWN PUBLISHING UNIT. THEY DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE THIS WHOLE THING WORK. IT DIDN'T PAN OUT AND THEY WERE SOLD TO MEREDITH PUBLISHING. THEY OWN BETTER HOMES & GARDENS AND THERE IS ONE THING ABOUT THAT PURCHASE THAT IS INTERESTING AND INVOLVES A FAMILIAR NAME. IT IS THAT THE KOCH INDUSTRIES PONIED UP 600 MONEY TO BUY TIME INC. WHAT DOES THAT BRING WITH IT? NO ONE REALLY KNOWS. THERE WILL BE NO BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THIS NEW ENTITY OF KOCH INDUSTRIES. BUT SOME HAVE SPECULATED THAT THEY COULD NONETHELESS USE THE MEDIA PROPERTIES WHICH REACH MILLIONS OF ONLINE AND PRINT READERS TO PROMOTE THEIR BRAND OF CONSERVATISM. MEREDITH HAS BEEN TRYING TO BUY TIME INC. FOR SOME TIME NOW. THEY RECENTLY TRIED TO BUY A BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH CAPITAL. THEN THE KOCH BROTHERS CAME IN AND GAVE THEM THE EXTRA 650 MILLION WHICH WAS CONVENIENT AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY DO HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY TIME INC. DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS, I DON'T KNOW THE POLITICS OF MEREDITH IS. SOME PEOPLE ARE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS SAYING THEY ARE FROM DES MOINES AND THEY HAVE THINGS LIKE FAMILY CIRCLE IN THE HOME AND GARDENS ñ I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANY OF THAT MEANS. SO WHAT? I GUESS THEY ARE TRYING TO IMPLY THAT MUST MEAN THAT THEY ARE CONSERVATIVE BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY LIBERALS WOULD WANT TO HAVE BETTER HOMES OR BETTER GARDENS? PERSONALLY I WOULD LIKE A BETTER HOME. BUT THE KOCH BROTHERS MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING WE DON'T. MAYBE MEREDITH IS CONSERVATIVE AND WE JUST DON'T KNOW? SOME MEDIA WE DO KNOW. SINCLAIR BROADCASTING, TOTALLY CONSERVATIVE AND DECEPTIVELY SO. THEY ARE DOING THE OLD TRICK FOX NEWS USED TO DO, FAIR AND BALANCED. THEY WILL PUT IN A HATCHET JOB OPINION PIECE LITTERED WITH WRONG INFORMATION INTO A LOCAL NEWS BROADCAST. AND YOU'RE LIKE WAIT A MINUTE IT'S NOT GOOD. IS DECEPTIVE. IF IT WAS SINCLAIR BROADCASTING BUYING TIME INC. AND THE KOCH BROTHERS GIVE THE MONEY, THE WHOLE POINT IS PROPAGANDA. IT MIGHT TURN OUT THE KOCH BROTHERS THINK IT IS A GOOD INVESTMENT AND THEY MIGHT MAKE MONEY. I GUESS TIME WILL TELL. AT THE VERY LEAST IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW OR IF TIME MAGAZINE CHANGES ITS COVERS IN THE FUTURE. MEREDITH DOES OWN LOCAL NEWS STATIONS BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN THE SAME KIND OF WRITEUPS. THERE IS ONE LAST POSSIBILITY. THAT MEREDITH ñ I DON'T MEREDITH IS LYING ABOUT THEIR BOARD COMPOSITION. SO THE KOCH BROTHERS DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO SAY HEY MR. MEREDITH, GO DO A HATCHET JOB ON THE LIVES. IF THEY KNOW THAT THE GUYS RUNNING MEREDITH ARE CONSERVATIVE THEY THINK WELL MAYBE IT IS A GOOD INVESTMENT, MAYBE IT IS NOT. ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO OWN TIME MAGAZINE IS KIND OF A FANTASY. NOW HAVING SAID ALL THAT I DON'T MIND THAT MUCH BECAUSE I THINK THEY ARE LARGELY MIXING THEIR MONEY. THEY ARE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF MEDIA. THAT GETS ME TO THE HISTORY OF TIME MAGAZINE. FOR A LONG TIME TIME MAGAZINE WAS NONPARTISAN AND DID GOOD WORK. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP ETC. IF YOU LOOK INTO THE HISTORY OF TIME, LOOSE, ONE OF THE OWNERS HELPED CIA SO THAT THE CIA COULD ORGANIZE COUPS AND SERVE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS INSTEAD. TIME MAGAZINE AIDED AND ABETTED THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN. AND THEN WE WILL GET TO ENJOY SEEING THE DEMISE OF THEIR MONEY QUICKER. IT'S JUST INTERESTING TO SEE THE COINCIDING OF AGING TYPES OF MEDIA LIKE PRINTS, WEEKLY MAGAZINES, AND LOCAL NEWS CHANNELS AND THE DEMOGRAPHIC THEY APPEALED TO. AND VOTER IDEOLOGY. IT SEEMS LIKE THE YOUNGER FOLKS ALWAYS SEEM TO BE SLANTING MORE PROGRESSIVE AND DON'T USE THAT MEDIA AT ALL. BUT AS YOU SEE MORE KOCH AFFILIATED, SINCLAIR, THOSE FOLKS ARE BUYING UP THOSE AGING PIECES OF MEDIA THAT WILL STILL BE PROVIDING NEWS TO PEOPLE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, IT IS JUST FASCINATING TO ME THAT THEY ARE LIKE WELL, IT IS STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT TODAY. AT THE END MAYBE WE WILL SHORTED IT, AND GET RID OF IT AND DUMP IT BEFORE IT GOES UNDER.
