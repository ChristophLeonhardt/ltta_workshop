Trump's UN General Assembly speech this year contains some old material not long ago Venezuela was one of the richest countries on earth today socialism has bankrupted the oil-rich nation virtually everywhere socialism or communism has been tried it has produced suffering corruption and decay all nations of the world should resist socialism and the misery that it brings to everyone Trump said roughly the same thing in last year's UN speech and he got a similar awkward response the problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented but that socialism has been faithfully implemented Trump doesn't seem to realize that the Cold War is over and the specter of Soviet style Marxism Leninism is no longer hanging over Eastern Europe meanwhile Trump also doesn't seem to realize that socialism is rather popular around the world the German Social Democratic Party the British Labour Party many political organizations and leaders across the world adhere to some vague form of socialism in fact socialism is getting more popular in places that are a lot closer to Washington than Venezuela we believe that every working-class American deserves the opportunity to change their economic destiny and their children's future that is well that's the message that we need to bring into the midterms facing head-on this crisis in our democracy where people feel like the same laws don't apply to rich hen and we should absolutely have a healthcare system that provides health care so every citizen in our country socialism is quite popular among Millennials in the United States more popular than capitalism in fact some pollsters say that if Donald Trump had run against Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential election he might not have been able to pull off his victory we decided to ask Dakota Lilly a young activist why he thinks that socialism is on the rise in the United States people my age especially they're really sick of you know bills that capitalism brings upon if you look at the student loan crisis right now student loan debt is the largest holder of debt in the country more than credit card debt you know we have for-profit you know educational institutions that charge sixty seventy eighty thousand dollars per semester per year you know the unemployment rate Trump says it's 4% or 3% in actuality it's eight nine ten percent third half the room is made up of socialists you know it's made up of people from Bolivia and Cuba Venezuela China you know and go South Africa it's made up of people who completely disagree with him on that and you know if you look at last year's speech he said you know socialism in Venezuela is not failing because it's being you know put to use wrongly it's being put to use completely correctly no one said anything for a good solid five seconds and then this year they laughed at him actually so when Trump repeated his anti-socialist tirade at the UN the question is was he really aiming at Caracas or was he aiming at a new source of opposition to his policies here at home where it seems that Trump has unwittingly made socialism great again Kalib Maupin RT New York you
