this classic car was once a vision for the future this is the BMW z1 it was a revolutionary car from the late eighties even though it only pushed 170 horsepower those packed full of features that owners would love it handled well it was made of lightweight material but the most impressive feature the vertical sliding doors if you've never seen one of these on the road it's because it was only sold in the European market but the doors are truly ahead of their time nothing like it had been built before and nothing like it has been built since it would have went down in history for the door innovation alone but BMW didn't stop there the z1 is the direct result of a think tank BMW formed in 1985 they took 60 of their best engineers technicians and designers and completely separated them from other development departments their goal was to bring their wildest creations to life BMW hoped that in the process they would employ new materials create different types of vehicle structure and shortened development time the team had free rein to pursue any idea they could imagine they created a car that was so aerodynamic it didn't require wings as boilers a car that could handle widening roads exceptionally well with its low center of gravity the first BMW to use a plastic exterior a car that you could literally drive with the doors down it was a completely new driving experience they've even had removable plastic paneling that owners could swap out and change the color of their car in just two years the think tank already had a working concept car it was the first roadster that BMW had made in 30 years the successor to its famed 507 and people couldn't get enough BMW in vailed the z1 at the 1987 Frankfurt International Motor Show and they were flooded with enquiries afterward the casa car was so popular BMW decided to produce a limited run and made 8,000 z1s from 1989 to 1991 because of the cars unconventional characteristics most of the z1 was built by hand when it was first released the z1 sold for fifty three thousand dollars today they go for upwards of $65,000 the z1 had all the makings of a collectible car limited production one-off features not sold in the US and a real joy to drive today the z1 has a large following owners take pride in these rare cars they love driving down winding roads with the doors down often stating that it feels like a motorcycle on four wheels would you get behind the wheel of this once futuristic ride
