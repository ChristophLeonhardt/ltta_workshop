1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,569
NOT TOO LONG AGO IN WEST
VIRGINIA THE TEACHERS DECIDED

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:06,839
THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING TO TAKE
IT ANYMORE AND THEY STRUCK, AND

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,059
IT TOOK A WHILE BUT FINALLY THEY
DID GET A PRETTY GOOD DEAL FOR

4
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:14,260
THEIR EFFORT IN TERMS OF PAY,
BENEFITS, AND ONE OF THEIR

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,760
BIGGEST CONCERNS ACTUALLY WAS
HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS AND

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,810
THINGS LIKE THAT.

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,950
NOW THE MEDIA
I THINK THAT A POOR JOB AT

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,350
TALKING AND COVERING THAT TOPIC.

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,600
BUT DESPITE THAT, THANKFULLY

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,420
TEACHERS UNIONS AROUND THE
COUNTRY PAID ATTENTION AND IN

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,850
THE WAKE OF THE WEST VIRGINIA
STRIKES OTHER STATES HAVE

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,100
DECIDED TO TAKE SOME SORT OF
COLLECTIVE ACTION WHEN IT COMES

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,969
TO THEIR EDUCATION SYSTEM.

14
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,860
OKLAHOMA IS ONE OF THE LATEST,

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,699
AND IT WAS ANNOUNCED A DAY OR
TWO AGO THAT THEY WERE GOING TO

16
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:41,690
DO A WALK OUT ON MONDAY.

17
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,719
THEY
HADN'T AS FAR AS I KNOW

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,879
ANNOUNCED ANY SORT OF ONGOING
STRIKE, BUT THEY WERE GOING TO

19
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,730
DO A DEMONSTRATION, AND ONE OF
THE REASONS IS I BELIEVE THEY

20
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,210
WERE AT PRESENT THE 47TH LOWEST
AVERAGE PAID TEACHERS IN THE

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,210
COUNTRY.

22
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,410
WHICH IS PRETTY INSANE.

23
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,480
AND THEY HADN'T GOTTEN A RAISE

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,300
IN SOME THING LIKE 10 YEARS.

25
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,910
SO
THEY ANNOUNCED A WALKOUT.

26
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,500
OKLAHOMA LAWMAKERS DECIDED TO DO
SOMETHING TO TRY TO WARD OFF

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:24,260
THAT WALKOUT --

28
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,670
THAT MIGHT NOT SOUND HUGE BUT
I HAVE A FEELING THAT OKLAHOMA

29
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,940
TEACHERS AREN'T MAKING $200,000
A YEAR, SO THAT'S SOMETHING

30
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,890
CERTAINLY, BUT IT WON'T BE
ENOUGH TO STOP THE WALKOUT.

31
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,890
THE

32
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,960
PRESIDENT FOR THE OKLAHOMA
EDUCATION ASSOCIATION HAD THIS

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:51,730
TO SAY AFTER IT WAS ANNOUNCED

34
00:01:51,730 --> 00:02:05,940
THAT THE RAISE WOULD BE FUNDED

35
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,940
--

36
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:12,459
I'M GLAD THAT THE UNION THERE
ISN'T JUST FOCUSED ON THEIR OWN

37
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:16,239
WAGES OF TEACHERS, BUT ALSO OF
SUPPORT STAFF IN THE SCHOOLS AND

38
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,769
FUNDING FOR THE SCHOOL WHICH IS
TRENDING DOWN NOT JUST IN

39
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,200
OKLAHOMA BUT IN A NUMBER OF
STATES OVER THE LAST DECADE

40
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,750
PLUS.

41
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,400
THIS IS A STATE WHERE
TEACHERS WOULD HAVE TO SUBSIDIZE

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,989
ONE DAY A WEEK WORKING AT
WALMART TO MAKE ENDS MEET, AND

43
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:36,489
ALSO JUST THE PAY, AND FILLING
QUOTAS, THERE WERE SO MANY

44
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,209
TEACHER SPOTS LEFT EMPTY THAT
THEY WERE FILLING QUOTAS WITH

45
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,629
SECRETARY SPOTS AND UNQUALIFIED
PEOPLE TO BE TEACHING KIDS.

46
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:44,629
BUT

47
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:47,060
I THINK THE BIGGEST TAKE AWAY IS
THE PREEMPTIVE MEASURES ON

48
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,499
BEHALF OF LEGISLATORS BECAUSE OF
THE FEAR OF STRIKING AND THE

49
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:51,499
FEAR OF UNIONS.

50
00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:53,870
WE ARE TALKING
ABOUT A 100 YEAR WAR ON WORKERS

51
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,999
AND UNIONS WE HAVE SEEN TAKE
PLACE WITH THE RICH AND POWERFUL

52
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:59,239
AND IT HAS WORKED, WE HAVE
ERASED IT FROM OUR

53
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,269
CONSCIOUSNESS, WE DON'T
UNDERSTAND THE ACTUAL MONUMENTAL

54
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:06,030
MOVEMENTS THAT UNIONS AND
WORKERS HAVE HAD, THE EIGHT HOUR

55
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,450
WORKDAY, THE WEEKEND, ALL LABOR
PROTECTIONS.

56
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,450
THIS IS A HUGE

57
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,469
MEASURE, IT'S ALSO JUST SHOWING
HOW SCARED LEGISLATORS ARE

58
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:16,349
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE POWER OF
WORKERS AND THE POWER OF PEOPLE

59
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:19,049
WALKING OUT, BECAUSE THEY KNOW
WHO REALLY PUTS THE WEALTH INTO

60
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:22,549
SOCIETY AND WHO MAKES SOCIETY
FUNCTION, BECAUSE THE RICH AND

61
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:25,609
POWERFUL WILL CEASED TO BE ABLE
TO WORK ANYTHING WITHOUT THE

62
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:26,909
WORKERS AT THEIR BEHEST.

63
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:29,469
THEY PUT THEM TO THE TEST IN
WEST VIRGINIA, THERE WERE

64
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:32,450
LITERALLY NO SCHOOLS IN ANY
COUNTY THAT WERE OPEN, SO

65
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,840
IMAGINE BEING A PARENT AND
HAVING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE

66
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,669
YOU GOING TO DO WITH YOUR KIDS
THAT DAY?

67
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:38,669
AND THEY KEPT THE

68
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:41,530
STRIKE GOING UNTIL THEY WON, SO
TEACHERS AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE

69
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,209
SAYING WE HAVE TO GO ON STRIKE
TOO AND PUT THEM TO THE TEST.

70
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:52,200
AND IN OKLAHOMA THEY WILL GET TO
THE WALKOUT, THEY HAVEN'T YET.

71
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,019
THEY JUST THREATENED, AND THEY
GOT A GIANT INCREASE IN THEIR

72
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:59,760
PAY, AND THEY GOT WHAT THEY
DESERVED.

73
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,269
IS NOT A QUESTION OF

74
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:04,120
GETTING MORE JUST BECAUSE YOU
WANT MORE, IT'S LIKE PEOPLE NEED

75
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,980
TO GET PAID WHAT THEY ARE WORTH,
AND RIGHT NOW TEACHERS ACROSS

76
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,319
THE COUNTRY IN MOST PLACES
AREN'T GETTING PAID WHAT THEY

77
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,569
ARE WORTH BECAUSE WE HAD THIS
RADICAL RIGHT WING SOCIAL

78
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:16,000
EXPERIMENT CALLED TRICKLE-DOWN
ECONOMICS WHERE WE GIVE ALL THE

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,079
MONEY TO THE RICH PEOPLE AND IT
SOMEHOW SPREADS TO THE REST OF

80
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,370
US MAGICALLY WITH THE MAGICAL
TRICKLE-DOWN FAIRY.

81
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,370
IT DOESN'T

82
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,830
WORK, AND WE ARE NOW REACHING
THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION OF THAT

83
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,150
SOCIAL EXPERIMENT AND REALIZING
IT'S COMPLETELY FALSE AND WE

84
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,440
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT
WAY TO DO THINGS BECAUSE YOU

85
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,889
CAN'T CUT PUBLIC SERVICES DOWN
TO THE BONE.

86
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:41,080
I DON'T THINK THE ANSWER IS
CUTTING OR MAKING OTHER WORKERS

87
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,910
PAY FOR THE TEACHERS, YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN?

88
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,910
TAXING CIGARETTES,

89
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,510
OIL, THIS IS OTHER AVERAGE
WORKERS WHO ARE PAYING MORE

90
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,710
FOR GAS, SECRETS, ALCOHOL, AND
I DON'T THINK THAT IS THE

91
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,180
ANSWER, I THINK THE ANSWER IS
TAXING THE RICH.

92
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,280
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

93
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,260
CAN WE PUT THIS IN CONTEXT?

94
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,680
THIS IS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST

95
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,750
STORIES I HAVE READ IN A LONG
TIME, ONE OF THE REDDEST STATES

96
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,680
IN THE COUNTRY, THE STATE THAT
PRODUCED SCOTT PRUITT -- IS

97
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,830
EVERY STORY ABOUT OKLAHOMA HERE?

98
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,810
IN OKA HOME A SPECIAL AT TYT.

99
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,110
IT'S ALL ONE DAY, GOOD
FRIDAY, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

100
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,110
OKLAHOMA.

101
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,710
HERE IS A RED, RED
STATE THAT AGREED TO RAISE

102
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,229
TAXES.

103
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:22,810
NO MATTER WHERE THE TAXES
ARE COMING FROM.

104
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,810
AND ON OIL AND

105
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,810
GAS.

106
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,260
THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY, AND A
REALLY GREAT, HOPEFUL THING

107
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,260
FOR THE FUTURE.

108
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,879
AND IN THEIR CONSTITUTION YOU
HAVE TO GET THREE FOURTHS OF THE

109
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,680
LEGISLATURE TO AGREE IN ORDER TO
RAISE ANY TAX.

110
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
SO THEY HAD TO

111
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,770
GET THREE FOURTHS OF A
REPUBLICAN DOMINATED LEGISLATURE

112
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,220
IN BOTH CHAMBERS TO AGREE TO
THIS TAX, AND THAT TO ME IS ALSO

113
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,419
REALLY HOPEFUL BECAUSE YOU ARE
STARTING TO SEE THIS POPULIST

114
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:49,009
BRUSHFIRE REVOLT NOT IN PLACES
LIKE, YOU KNOW, NEW YORK AND

115
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:53,030
CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON AND
VERMONT, IT'S, LIKE, HAPPENING

116
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,590
IN OKLAHOMA AND WEST VIRGINIA
AND PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF IT AND

117
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,819
THEY WON'T PUT UP WITH IT
ANYMORE, AND THEY WILL FORCE

118
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:04,349
EVEN A DOMINATED REPUBLICAN
LEGISLATURE, I IMAGINE IT'S 75%

119
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:08,610
REPUBLICAN, VOTING TO THE TUNE
OF 75% INCREASE TAXES BECAUSE

120
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,050
THEY REALIZE THIS SOCIAL
EXPERIMENT OF TRICKLE-DOWN

121
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,629
ECONOMICS DOESN'T WORK, IT'S
BROKEN.

122
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:18,780
AND IT DIDN'T EVEN REQUIRE A
TWEET FROM DAVID HOGG.

123
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,930
I LOVE THAT 75% THRESHOLD,
OKLAHOMA IS OBVIOUSLY NOT THE

124
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,039
ONLY STATE THAT HAS THAT, AND
THE STATES THAT HAVE AN EXTRA

125
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,550
THRESHOLD FOR CERTAIN LAWS, WHY
IS IT ALWAYS FOR TAXES?

126
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,550
LIKE

127
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,800
WHAT STATE DO YOU NEED 80% OF
THE VOTE TO TAKE AWAY ABORTION

128
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,280
RIGHTS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

129
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,699
IT'S ONLY RAISING TAXES.

130
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:36,699
AND

131
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:38,889
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE
IF YOU GET ENOUGH OF A MAJORITY

132
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:44,750
YOU CRIPPLE SOCIAL AND
LEGISLATIVE PROGRESS POSSIBLY

133
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,199
FOR DECADES ON ANY NUMBER OF
DIFFERENT ISSUES, IT'S ONE OF

134
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,639
THOSE TRICKLE-DOWN POLICIES.

135
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,760
BUT
I FIND THIS TO BE POSITIVE TOO,

136
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,110
YOU MENTIONED DAVID HOGG, I LOVE
THAT THE UNIONS ARE GETTING MORE

137
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,110
ACTIVE, I THINK THERE ARE FEW
INDIVIDUAL THINGS THAT COULD BE

138
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,280
BETTER FOR AMERICA RIGHT NOW
THEN AN ENTIRELY INVIGORATED,

139
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,830
ACTIVE, PASSIONATE UNION PUSH
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, ACROSS ALL

140
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,830
INDUSTRIES.

141
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,120
BUT EVEN OUTSIDE OF
UNIONS IN THE PAST YEAR OR TWO

142
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,330
WE HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF HUGE
MARCHES, EVEN RECENTLY THE MARCH

143
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,000
FOR OUR LIVES, AND THAT PEOPLE
ARE GETTING OUT THERE, THEY ARE

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,979
GETTING OUT IN THE STREETS AND
GETTING OUT TO RUN IN PRIMARIES,

145
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:23,219
AND I KNOW SOME INDIVIDUALS
MIGHT LOOK AT A PARTICULAR MARCH

146
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:27,640
AND SAY THAT SEEMS LIKE A WASTE
OF TIME, I'M NOT OF THAT

147
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,530
OPINION, I THINK THAT AMERICANS
HAVE BEEN POLITICALLY APATHETIC

148
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,250
FOR FAR TOO LONG, SO ALMOST
ANYTHING THEY CAN GET MOTIVATED

149
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,620
FOR I'M A FAN OF.

150
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,530
BUT WHEN YOU
SEE PEOPLE MARCHING FOR

151
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,650
LITERALLY THE CONCEPT OF
SCIENCE, OR FOR THOSE SORTS

152
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,020
OF THINGS, THAT I THINK IS A
VERY POSITIVE THING.

153
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,699
AND I'M ALL FOR UNIONS BEING AS
BIG A PART OF THAT AS POSSIBLE.

154
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,379
AND THESE PEOPLE ARE SCARED OF
THE CONTAGION OF STRIKE STOP AND

155
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:53,210
WE SAW THE WEST VIRGINIA
TEACHERS STRIKE WORKED, THIS IS

156
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,789
GOING TO WORK, UNIONS AND
STRIKES WORK AND THEY PUT THE

157
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,280
FEAR OF GOD INTO LEGISLATORS AND
BUSINESS OWNERS.

158
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
AND I HATE THAT

159
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,229
WORKERS ARE DEMONIZED, WORKERS
WHO WALKOUT, THEY SAY THEY DON'T

160
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:05,880
CARE ABOUT THE KIDS -- THESE
PEOPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE

161
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,720
KIDS, OUR SCHOOLS ARE
UNDERFUNDED, THERE IS NO

162
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,150
INCENTIVE FOR THE RICH AND
POWERFUL TO PUT FUNDING IN THE

163
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,340
SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED
THE MASSES EDUCATED, IT'S MOSTLY

164
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,139
SERVICE SECTOR JOBS, THEY JUST
WANT THE 1% THAT THEY CAN PUT IN

165
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,310
THEIR PRIVATE EDUCATION.

166
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,310
SO WE
NEED TO EMBOLDEN WORKERS AND

167
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,370
SUPPORT THEM FOR WALKING OUT AND
ENCOURAGE THAT THIS IS THE

168
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,999
ANSWER TO HOLD THE RICH AND
POWERFUL ACCOUNTABLE.

169
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,659
BUT CONSERVATIVES ARE HAPPY TO
GIVE THEM GUNS.

170
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,120
PENCILS, NO.

171
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:44,139
PENCILS, CROWNS, PAPER, I
JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.

172
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:45,139
BUT

173
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:46,790
IF YOU NEED GUNS WE'VE GOT THEM
COVERED.

174
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,380
THAT'S THE CRAZY

175
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,060
TWILIGHT ZONE POLITICS WE ARE
LIVING IN IN AMERICA TODAY.

176
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,250
I WAS IN DC FOR THE MARCH ON
SATURDAY AND IT WAS

177
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,079
EXHILARATING, AND IT DON'T THINK
THAT THE ENERGY THAT WAS CREATED

178
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,540
BY THOSE 800,000 IN DC AND
THOSE MILLIONS ALL OVER THE

179
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,579
WORLD WAS LIMITED TO GUNS, I
THINK IT WAS LIGHTING THE MATCH

180
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,670
THAT IS GOING TO SPREAD ALL OVER
THE PLACE.

181
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,490
AND I THINK WE ARE

182
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,190
MOVING INTO A POSITIVE TIME AS
WE HEAD INTO THE MIDTERMS WHICH

183
00:09:15,190 --> 00:00:00,000
IS WHERE THE REAL TSUNAMI CAN
HAPPEN.
