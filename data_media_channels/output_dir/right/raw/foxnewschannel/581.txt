00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:19,372
BEEN UPHELD, SOME CAME OUT LATE.

191
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:17,408
SOME HAVE FALLING UNDER THE

192
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:16,509
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE FROM THE

193
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:15,576
BUSH AND ADMINISTRATION.

194
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:14,244
RESPONSE TO THAT COMPLAINT?

195
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:09,449
>> MORE PAPER HAS BEEN PRODUCED

196
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:08,083
FOR THIS NOMINEE THAN ANY

197
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:08,083
NOMINEE IN HISTORY.

198
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:05,186
WE HAVE 12 YEARS OF DECISIONS ON

199
00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:05,186
WE HAVE 12 YEARS OF DECISIONS ON

200
00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:03,355
THE D.C. CIRCUIT WHICH ARE

201
00:06:03,355 --> 00:05:57,194
DIRECTLY RELATED TO HIS

202
00:05:57,194 --> 00:05:57,194
NOMINATION.

203
00:05:57,595 --> 00:05:56,229
EVERY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE

204
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:56,229
SCREAMING ABOUT GETTING MORE

205
00:05:56,896 --> 00:05:55,597
PAPERS HAVE ALREADY ANNOUNCED

206
00:05:55,597 --> 00:05:54,264
THEY WILL VOTE AGAINST HIM.

207
00:05:54,264 --> 00:05:54,264
WHAT ELSE DO THEY NEED TO KNOW?

208
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:52,767
THEY ARE ALREADY AGAINST HIM.

209
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:50,201
THIS IS A SMOKE SCREEN.

210
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:49,970
WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE ARGUING

211
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:47,205
ABOUT PROCESS, YOU KNOW, THEY

212
00:05:47,205 --> 00:05:45,307
GOT NOTHING ELSE.

213
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:43,375
WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH, THERE IS

214
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:42,877
REALLY NO GOOD ARGUMENT NOT TO

215
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:41,778
CONFIRM THAT.

216
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:40,512
>> Bret: YOU COMPLAIN, THOUGH,

217
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:38,781
BY THE DEMOCRATIC TACTICS,

218
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:37,815
PUSHING BACK AGAINST KAVANAUGH.

219
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:34,818
BUT WHAT ABOUT MERRICK GARLAND,

220
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:32,453
AND WOULDN’T YOU HAVE THROWN A

221
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:30,289
FIT OF DEMOCRATS TREATED A

222
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:28,024
G.O.P. NOMINEE THE WAY YOU

223
00:05:28,024 --> 00:05:28,024
TREATED GARLAND?

224
00:05:28,558 --> 00:05:25,661
>> LOOK, I WAS QUOTING JOE BIDEN

225
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:25,661
>> LOOK, I WAS QUOTING JOE BIDEN

226
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:23,329
IN 1992, WHO SAID IF A VACANCY

227
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:21,231
OCCURRED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

228
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:20,833
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THEY

229
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:18,801
WOULDN’T FILL IT.

230
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:17,969
DEMOCRATIC, SENATE, REPUBLICAN,

231
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:15,671
PRESIDENT.

232
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:14,805
CHUCK SCHUMER AND HARRY REID

233
00:05:14,805 --> 00:05:13,573
SAID, 18 MONTHS BEFORE THE END

234
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:09,610
OF THE BUSH YEARS, IF A VACANCY

235
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:08,311
OCCURRED, AND A PRESIDENTIAL

236
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:07,779
YEAR, THEY WOULDN’T FILL IT.

237
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:05,281
I KNEW IF SHE WAS ON THE OTHER

238
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:01,819
FOOT, AND WE HAD A VACANCY

239
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:00,419
NOMINATING A REPUBLICAN

240
00:05:00,419 --> 00:04:59,654
PRESIDENT TO A DEMOCRATIC SENATE

241
00:04:59,654 --> 00:04:59,654
PRESIDENT TO A DEMOCRATIC SENATE

242
00:04:59,654 --> 00:04:56,991
AND THE MIDDLE OF A PRESIDENTIAL

243
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:56,991
AND THE MIDDLE OF A PRESIDENTIAL

244
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:54,425
YEAR, THEY WOULDN’T FILL IT.

245
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:53,693
LISTEN, THAT WAS SIMPLY NOT

246
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:52,995
GOING TO HAPPEN.

247
00:04:52,995 --> 00:04:50,229
I SAID, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE

248
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:48,665
TO WEIGH IN ON THIS LIFETIME

249
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:46,433
APPOINTMENT, AND WHOEVER THEY

250
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:45,768
CHOSE, MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT IT

251
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:43,737
WAS GOING TO BE HILLARY CLINTON.

252
00:04:43,737 --> 00:04:43,737
WAS GOING TO BE HILLARY CLINTON.

253
00:04:43,737 --> 00:04:42,738
WHOEVER WAS BEING ELECTED IN THE

254
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:42,738
WHOEVER WAS BEING ELECTED IN THE

255
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:41,439
MIDDLE OF THAT HERE OUGHT TO

256
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:40,773
MAKE THAT DECISION.

257
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:39,708
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED.

258
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:36,377
THE DEMOCRATS LOST.

259
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:35,878
>> Bret: YOU KEPT THE SENATE

PRESIDENT’S REQUEST.

00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:28,986
YOU MENTIONED, AND SPENDING

265
00:04:28,986 --> 00:04:25,588

WHY WOULDN’T THE PRESIDENT OR TO

269
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:21,625
MONEY FOR A WALL?

270
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:19,027
IS THAT STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT

271
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:19,027
IS THAT STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT

00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:18,629
THIS THING ALL COMES CRASHING TO

00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,629
THIS THING ALL COMES CRASHING TO

274
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:17,663
A HALT?

275
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:15,965

OTHER SUBSTANCE.

280
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:07,907
BUT IT ALSO, 90% OF THE FEDERAL

AS HE POINTED OUT, THAT HADN’T

285
00:04:00,013 --> 00:03:59,381
HAPPENED SINCE 1997.

286
00:03:59,381 --> 00:03:58,649
WE STILL ARE IN FAVOR OF THE

NEGOTIATED IT.

00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:41,398
AN AGREEMENT ON GOVERNMENT

353
00:02:41,398 --> 00:02:39,833
SPENDING AND THEN YOU DON’T?

354

355
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:35,070
WE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION TODAY.

00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:33,539
I EXPECT HIM TO SIGN THESE NINE

357
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:32,674
BILLS INTO LAW.

358
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:30,309
THAT WILL FUND 90% OF THE

FISCAL YEAR.

363
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:24,982
THEN I EXPECT US TO DO A SHORT

BALANCE OF THE FUNDING AND THEN

367
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:19,920
HAVE THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW

368
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:17,389
TO FUND THE WALL AFTER THE

369
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:17,389

370
00:02:17,756 --> 00:02:15,891

00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:13,426
ON REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE?

372
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:10,930

SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, WHO VOTED

382
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:04,535
NO ON THAT.

383
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:03,937
SENATOR KYL PERHAPS WOULD VOTE

GONE FOR THIS YEAR?

388
00:01:58,508 --> 00:01:56,243
>> FOR THIS CONGRESS, IT WOULD

389
00:01:56,243 --> 00:01:53,280
BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE.

390
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:52,548
I THINK WHETHER WE CAN ACHIEVE

391
00:01:52,548 --> 00:01:51,949
IT LATER DEPENDS UPON THE

392
00:01:51,949 --> 00:01:49,317
RESULTS THIS FALL AND THE

393
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:48,485
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE TO

00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:48,485
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE TO

00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:47,219
DECIDE WHAT KIND OF CONGRESS

396
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:45,688
THEY WANT TO HAVE COMING INTO

397
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:44,222
THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

398
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:43,323
>> Bret: WHAT ARE REPUBLICANS

RUNNING ON?

400
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:41,725
IT DOESN’T SEEM LIKE A TOTALLY

401
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:40,927
UNIFIED MESSAGE.

402
00:01:40,927 --> 00:01:39,894
IS THERE ONE?

403
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:36,530
>> I THINK THE ECONOMY.

404
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:35,531
IT’S A RED-HOT ECONOMY.

405
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:34,566
THE POLICIES OF THIS

406
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:33,634
ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS HAVE

00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:33,634
ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS HAVE

408
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:31,269
MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE, WHETHER

409
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:29,671
IT IS TAX REFORM OUR REGULATORY

410
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:28,005
RELIEF.

411
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:26,207
THE COUNTRY IS BOOMING.

412
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:23,677
THESE ARE RECORD NUMBERS THAT WE

413
00:01:23,677 --> 00:01:23,677
THESE ARE RECORD NUMBERS THAT WE

414
00:01:23,677 --> 00:01:21,846

00:01:18,449 --> 00:01:15,518
PEOPLE ALL ACROSS OUR NATION.

418
00:01:15,518 --> 00:01:14,953
THAT IS A RESULT OF THIS

419
00:01:14,953 --> 00:01:13,787
REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT.

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:11,990
WE THINK WE HAVE PLENTY TO IRAN,

422
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:10,957
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT WE ARE

THEY GO    GO TO COURT.

430
00:00:59,134 --> 00:00:58,569

431
00:00:58,569 --> 00:00:56,137

00:00:50,277 --> 00:00:48,279
ON THAT FRONT.

439
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:48,279
