before I left so I was in Iraq a little

33

bit during Saddam's time and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

34
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,749
bit after the 2003 invasion I arrived in

43
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,240
to be refugee send us those questions

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,740
answer them myself but one of the

46
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,930
questions we got and this was one that

47
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,800
got a few variations of is why didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,410
stay<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for your country or try</font>

49
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,540
to make your country better well uh

50
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">first thing first I was again 16 on I</font>

51
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,489
left so I was pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much a child i did</font>

52
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:33,330
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font>

53
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,150
use a weapon<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatever second and i</font>

54
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,090
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> more most importantly the reasons</font>

55
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,460
that forced me to leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> iraq really left</font>

56
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,470
me no choice but to leave the rock<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

57
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,480
didn't leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rock because i wanted</font>

58
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,320
to uh in two thousand six in november

59
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,570
two thousand six my father<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kidnapped</font>

60
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,110
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> iraq on his way back home</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

61
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,360
my family few days<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that was</font>

62
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,690
threatened to leave iraq and at the time

63
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is during the sectarian civil war</font>

64
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,840
in iraq folks really didn't have a

65
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">choice to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if someone came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

66
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,380
threaten you to leave and brick ripped

67
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,240
your family apart you really don't have

68
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,520
a choice whether you can stay or not if

69
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,860
you stay you die and at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I</font>

70
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,770
didn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> die so we we made the</font>

71
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,709
call on me we fled<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iraq and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

72
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,300
middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the night with nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

73
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,760
much so I wouldn't say that's a choice

74
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,500
that I made it was something that I was

75
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,240
forced<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to do um and I sought to</font>

76
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,150
seek something better for my life and

77
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,320
for my family<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I fled hoping to get a</font>

78
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,510
better opportunity which fortunately I

79
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,880
did when I came to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US yeah I think</font>

80
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,320
that's something that a lot of folks

81
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,810
don't understand that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is literally in</font>

82
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,570
most cases of<font color="#CCCCCC"> life and death decision</font>

83
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,300
for folks who are you know deciding

84
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,080
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they're going to flee</font>

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,340
their country and try to become a

86
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,090
refugee one of the things that's going

87
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,580
on right now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> president Trump says the</font>

88
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,040
US needs more intense screening of

89
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,530
refugees in order to prevent terrorist

90
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,989
attacks I guess a lot of people don't

91
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,489
realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most refugees already go</font>

92
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,130
through 18 to 24 months of really

93
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,070
intense interviews and background checks

94
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,209
so for the folks out there can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you kind</font>

95
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,030
of explain what that process is like for

96
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,280
most refugees and what exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> you went</font>

97
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,229
through personally in order to hit

98
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:31,140
refugee status yeah I'd love to<font color="#CCCCCC"> egan so</font>

99
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,340
um this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I hear on and</font>

100
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,340
on and on about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vetting process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

101
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,120
extreme bedding and in my case

102
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,500
personally and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a one case</font>

103
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,590
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> millions my vetting likes</font>

104
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,990
that ain't took eight years between the

105
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,120
day that I arrived in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the United States</font>

106
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,930
to the day until today when I have my my

107
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,450
green card it took me almost over eight

108
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,220
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> of being bedded of going through</font>

109
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,440
multiple levels from applying through

110
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,480
the United Nations previously then

111
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,310
applying through a visa to come to the

112
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,710
United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> and once I'm in the United</font>

113
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,750
States I have to submit<font color="#E5E5E5"> every single</font>

114
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,580
document that I have and be interviewed

115
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,750
and I renew my papers basically every

116
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,020
single year as a student while<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was in</font>

117
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,720
college and after when I applied<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

118
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,660
asylum again the vetting process for

119
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">asylees especially for those coming from</font>

120
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,410
that now six countries previously seven

121
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,900
countries that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bans countries is regular</font>

122
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,610
rigorous it's insane I mean I can't

123
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">describe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you how tough it was for me</font>

124
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,560
to go through these vetting processes um

125
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,570
the interview even<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asylum</font>

126
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,730
interview usually what they do is they

127
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,250
have one interview with an immigration

128
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,050
officer and it's a very lengthy

129
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,530
interview asking you about very specific

130
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,560
details on why you left your country and

131
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,650
why should we protect you and why should

132
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,410
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you a silent to stay in the US</font>

133
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,860
and I have to do two interviews not just

134
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,100
one but two interviews and then so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

135
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,290
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to my interview</font>

136
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,640
that was a 22 years way and then after

137
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,610
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I waited another year just to apply</font>

138
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,590
for my green card and then it was few

139
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,060
months after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that till I received it so</font>

140
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,640
it I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get any more</font>

141
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,900
extreme than that um I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answers</font>

142
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,620
the question yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean can you google</font>

143
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,290
kind of uh so you leave Iraq but you

144
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,090
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> come straight to the US from there</font>

145
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,110
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's a kind of a</font>

146
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,630
misconception that refugees flee their

147
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,510
country and then they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> arrived in</font>

148
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,760
your case what where did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go for a</font>

149
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,030
second country<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then how long after</font>

150
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,500
arriving there did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it take for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font>

151
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,790
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> permission to come to us for the</font>

152
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,330
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

153
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,360
sure though yeah so when I left when I

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,289
left to Rock'em late 06 I saw refuges in

155
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:09,090
Damascus Syria and at the time Syria was

156
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,250
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> neighboring country that was</font>

157
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,669
accepted in Iraqi refugees so I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

158
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:17,159
Damascus<font color="#CCCCCC"> sighs I was a refugee there for</font>

159
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:19,919
two years between<font color="#E5E5E5"> most late 06 too late</font>

160
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,259
08 before coming to to the US so while i

161
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,129
was in Damascus<font color="#E5E5E5"> I joined a project that</font>

162
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:30,990
grassroots effort to help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> rocky</font>

163
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,620
refugee students obtain scholarships to

164
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,180
come and finish their education in the

165
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">US so I i joined the program's called a</font>

166
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,440
rocky student project and in summer of

167
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,069
summer of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two thousand eight i applied</font>

168
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:49,080
for visa<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got my acceptance and I</font>

169
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">platform visa to come to the u.s.</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

170
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,129
that's how I arrived here in August 2008

171
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,330
so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the questions we've gotten</font>

172
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,080
from our readers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook is why</font>

173
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,300
don't the country countries that are

174
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,719
next door to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iraq that are more</font>

175
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,440
culturally similar similar that are

176
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,659
geographically closer why don't they

177
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,690
take refugees and why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try to</font>

178
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,979
go to one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> countries instead of</font>

179
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,740
coming here yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's a great</font>

180
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,389
question and it's a question that I've

181
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,500
asked myself multiple times when i was

182
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,599
in Syria at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time who wait even if</font>

183
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,599
Iran Jordan Saudi Arabia whatever

184
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,519
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> close their borders except</font>

185
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,198
Syria so it's definitely not again<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I</font>

186
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:43,078
had an<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity to go to Kuwait or to</font>

187
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:46,500
Jordan or to wherever to escape violence

188
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,420
that was going on in Iraq at the time

189
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,649
and Baghdad I would have done so without

190
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:54,720
even thinking about it so again it's not

191
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,640
a choice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I made why I went to Syria</font>

192
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,740
why these countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> closed their borders</font>

193
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't know i don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's okay the</font>

194
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,290
same way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's okay for the</font>

195
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,540
u.s. to close its borders for folks who

196
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,940
are seeking refuge because again you

197
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,100
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have we all have to remember</font>

198
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,920
that people are fleeing their country

199
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,500
not because they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> but because of</font>

200
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,139
the circumstances that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are forcing them</font>

201
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:21,120
to flee if they have job opportunities

202
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,060
if they have the education they need

203
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever and they're good to stay there</font>

204
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,320
not trust me they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to leave</font>

205
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,720
if they didn't have war and conflict

206
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,870
happening constantly and people dying

207
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,970
and being displaced on daily basis

208
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,639
they're not going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leave their</font>

209
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,620
country because if they're settled why

210
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,980
would they leave but folks leave because

211
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,329
they're forced<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exactly and I think</font>

212
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:50,279
it's important to note that some of

213
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,139
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries like Jordan and Turkey</font>

214
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:54,930
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example have taken in more refugees</font>

215
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,250
than any other country in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

216
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,320
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> million-plus refugees in both</font>

217
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,660
of those countries not all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them are</font>

218
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay there there with the UN</font>

219
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,980
waiting to be resettled somewhere else

220
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,269
but those countries have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know played</font>

221
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,910
their part in this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well another</font>

222
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,670
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've got is you know with</font>

223
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,190
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> current climate in the country and</font>

224
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the president's rhetoric around refugees</font>

225
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,329
what what kind of racism or hate did you

226
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:21,269
face when you came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to America or deface</font>

227
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:25,079
any at all so interestingly one night

228
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:27,269
when I arrived to the US and up until

229
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:29,699
recently up until the elections<font color="#E5E5E5"> i really</font>

230
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:32,100
i rarely encountered any kind of

231
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,839
discrimination any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of racial slurs</font>

232
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,620
whatever with people with strangers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

233
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,140
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that existed up until</font>

234
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,110
recently or it did exist but it didn't

235
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,839
have it wasn't amplified as it is

236
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,410
nowadays so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I rarely really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> encountered</font>

237
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,410
any any kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a situation where</font>

238
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:00,360
someone did not accept me for my origins

239
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,730
where I come from or my religious

240
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,449
backgrounds or whatever in college<font color="#E5E5E5"> my I</font>

241
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:08,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">have friends or Democrats Republicans</font>

242
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,040
who open their doors from you and

243
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,519
welcome you to their families and and I

244
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,130
those people I wouldn't be here without

245
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,269
their support nowadays that's not that's

246
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:25,079
what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing folks simply saying all</font>

247
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,510
typhus from Iraq then simply

248
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,540
is uh like he's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Muslim mugen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Donna and</font>

249
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,270
then because I'm a Muslim and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a</font>

250
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:38,160
threat and and again I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like one</font>

251
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">person from millions and nowadays were</font>

252
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,310
facing also a culture that generalizes

253
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,130
the word refugee or immigrants that if

254
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,450
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are an immigrant then you're just</font>

255
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,390
from one pool of immigrants and that's

256
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,340
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> true we come from different</font>

257
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,150
traditions and countries and backgrounds

258
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,760
and where we each<font color="#E5E5E5"> even folks who come</font>

259
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,300
from Iraq each individual has his or her

260
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,430
own story so it's it's not all just like

261
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,150
a one thing do you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those</font>

262
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,880
interactions are different face to face

263
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,570
versus online like you're more likely to

264
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,360
get kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hate when you're on social</font>

265
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,920
media versus when you're having a

266
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,780
face-to-face conversation with your

267
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,120
solutely absolutely i mean i think one

268
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,600
of the reasons why this wet redder

269
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,970
rhetoric is so<font color="#E5E5E5"> encouraged right now is</font>

270
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,850
because there's a lack of knowledge

271
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">about refugees and about immigrants and</font>

272
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,530
and why they're they're coming today or

273
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,060
that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the United</font>

274
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,670
States so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of lack of</font>

275
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,450
information being misinformed is

276
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,100
obviously on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

277
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,130
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy platform to go and engage</font>

278
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,460
with with folks and might not even know

279
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,220
anything about them but you feel

280
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,320
entitled to share your opinion there and

281
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,640
that's fine but again I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

282
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">be very cautious on the idea of making a</font>

283
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,580
judgment<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that about a group of</font>

284
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that we have no idea who they are</font>

285
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,050
and where they come from and why why are

286
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">they choosing to seek refuge in the</font>

287
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,150
United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States and folks just go on the</font>

288
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,610
internet and claim<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these people are</font>

289
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,060
dangerous or these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are you know</font>

290
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever that we've been hearing in the</font>

291
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,120
news about immigrants and I personally

292
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,449
also really dislike the word alien

293
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,790
calling us aliens doesn't make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

294
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,579
me and then putting the label legal and

295
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:54,449
illegal aliens is just it's weird um I

296
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:56,250
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's just my personal</font>

297
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,610
opinion that I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share I haven't</font>

298
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">met you in person but you look very</font>

299
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,970
human over<font color="#E5E5E5"> Skype you know you look like</font>

300
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,959
an alien kettle that's good what another

301
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,850
question uh you know we talked a little

302
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,769
bit before<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the really intense</font>

303
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:13,740
almost eight years you said process that

304
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,199
you've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> through for security and</font>

305
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:18,990
bedding you know Trump says we need to

306
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,310
improve this<font color="#CCCCCC"> process what do you think</font>

307
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:24,060
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do to improve the process of</font>

308
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,550
applying for refugee status and

309
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,699
resettling in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US if you were in</font>

310
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:32,160
charge what changes did you make I mean

311
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,089
if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was in charge i would i would</font>

312
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:39,720
definitely you know uh I it's not going

313
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,610
to be that's a tough<font color="#E5E5E5"> question but I</font>

314
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,620
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to be easy i</font>

315
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't say everyone can come in and this</font>

316
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,259
everyone gets a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a green card and</font>

317
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:51,480
whatever obviously you know you have

318
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,939
criterias and people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure</font>

319
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:58,139
that you your story and you know you're

320
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,120
presenting facts and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming here</font>

321
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,980
for a reason you're seeking refuge for

322
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,630
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> country for a reason you want</font>

323
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,630
safety you seek shelter but at the same

324
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,600
time you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font>

325
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,519
country so all that must be taken into

326
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,040
consideration however<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it's</font>

327
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,290
already too extreme like there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was no</font>

328
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason for example that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i had to go</font>

329
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:23,670
through a to interview process or i had

330
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,240
to wait for this long just to simply say

331
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,170
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can stay here and there's no</font>

332
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">threat to me to go back right where I</font>

333
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:39,240
come from and that's and again that's

334
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,000
that's what was so challenging<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me</font>

335
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,829
when when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the interview is how</font>

336
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:49,110
extreme they got<font color="#CCCCCC"> is they did you know I</font>

337
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">told them about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> story of my father</font>

338
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,210
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> told</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them how we were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> threatened</font>

339
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,240
but they also told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me well like they</font>

340
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,830
said that it was your father who is

341
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,390
kidnapped it was your father who

342
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,470
disappeared but it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so how</font>

343
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,320
like tell us why your story is it's true

344
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,230
so again you you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it was</font>

345
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,470
super uncomfortable for me but again

346
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:17,450
they take it too far sometimes and so

347
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,250
when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> say let's make it more extreme</font>

348
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,560
I don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's</font>

349
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,990
already too extreme and the immigration

350
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,930
system already had its flaws before this

351
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,810
current administration that needed to be

352
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,070
addressed needed to be fixed and now

353
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,870
it's just unfortunately it's getting

354
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:42,120
worse so I I don't know so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's talk</font>

355
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit about what Trump's</font>

356
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:48,390
executive orders actually try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so</font>

357
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,790
both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them are basically the same in</font>

358
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,140
regards<font color="#E5E5E5"> to refugees they tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to halt</font>

359
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">all refugee resettlement to the US for</font>

360
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,120
120 days and then maybe started back up

361
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">after that depending on how the review</font>

362
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,470
goes and they want to cap the total

363
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,300
number of refugees<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the US would</font>

364
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,910
accept this year at 50,000 which is less

365
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,500
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> half 310,000 you Obama</font>

366
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,199
adminstration agreed to take both of

367
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,959
those have been held up by federal

368
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,000
judges and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of waiting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

369
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,079
through the court system to find out

370
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,970
what happens next now a lot of people

371
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,699
out there might think that because these

372
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,410
bands were blocked that everything is

373
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,230
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine refugees but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know at least</font>

374
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,120
in my reporting that that's not exactly

375
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,040
the case that these bands have already

376
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,540
made things really difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> for people</font>

377
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,640
who are in the US and have families who

378
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,380
are trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come here or for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

379
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,390
who are abroad and trying to cap so what

380
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,790
what is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect even with these bands</font>

381
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">being blocked by judges on refugee</font>

382
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,000
resettlement right now sure so let me

383
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you about my personal experience</font>

384
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,190
with with these bends<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the first</font>

385
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,910
band so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> when when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you rock was part of</font>

386
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recently got my travel document</font>

387
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,820
which is again another story of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

388
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,850
get that to go and see my<font color="#CCCCCC"> family and</font>

389
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">Australia who might haven't seen in over</font>

390
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,850
12 years so fortunately all work that I

391
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,190
went there had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great time so my family</font>

392
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">was great came back a few days before</font>

393
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,100
inauguration and then a week after that

394
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,390
or so the first band was what was was

395
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,440
signed now if I didn't come back in time

396
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,390
when I did I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know where I</font>

397
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,750
would be today and i am<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a hundred</font>

398
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,669
percent sure that i would be speaking

399
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:42,330
with you today if I didn't come back in

400
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,049
time then the second came and they took

401
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:48,990
your rock off the list and for some

402
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,409
reason people expect me to be okay with

403
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:54,179
with this band just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iraq is out</font>

404
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it but that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think those folks are</font>

405
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,000
missing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really not about</font>

406
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,830
being selective on which countries you

407
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,059
are it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that why are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> banning</font>

408
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,280
these countries and on what basis are

409
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,000
you not allowing these people to to come

410
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">here and it still is still wrong it's</font>

411
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,900
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> on American and still it's it's</font>

412
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,539
not what it's you know I fled Iraq

413
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,000
because of religious persecution back to

414
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,720
me 2006 I<font color="#E5E5E5"> came here because you know</font>

415
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of America's religious freedom</font>

416
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,299
because of you know the the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Liberty</font>

417
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,940
liberty for you to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be who you</font>

418
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">are and be accepted for what you believe</font>

419
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,400
in and whatever this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not what what</font>

420
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,000
you know what what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I signed up for and</font>

421
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,940
these fans again like even though Iraq

422
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,380
is not on the list I still feel feel

423
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,419
kind of insecure and unsafe because

424
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:02,789
anything can happen in the next few

425
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:04,770
months or whatever that could even

426
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,780
impact folks who have green card like

427
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,480
myself which took me eight years to get

428
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,909
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still very very uncertain and if</font>

429
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:17,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is really unfair for for people</font>

430
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,140
with families and

431
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,720
for the many many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who don't even</font>

432
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,030
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> safety of a green card</font>

433
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,730
absolutely one more question<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our</font>

434
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,310
viewers out there and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is eventually</font>

435
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,520
do you plan on going<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Iraq to try</font>

436
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,460
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a better future for your</font>

437
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,230
nation in your people are you hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

438
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,980
stay in the US for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre stable future</font>

439
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,540
look Iraq was<font color="#E5E5E5"> my country of origin</font>

440
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:52,710
America is my new home so that's it do I

441
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,650
want Iraq to become a better safer place

442
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,290
yes one hundred percent do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want the</font>

443
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,340
people of Iraq to stop dying to stop

444
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,250
being forced to leave their their homes

445
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,600
and their families one hundred percent

446
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,960
but this where I live right now I have

447
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,720
embraced everything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> America about</font>

448
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,870
its culture its its norms its values is

449
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,650
diversity and I love it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what it</font>

450
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">made me the man that I am today and I</font>

451
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,660
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I go back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your rock one</font>

452
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,870
day I'm gonna feel strange in my country

453
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,540
of origin because I've you know I've

454
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:38,160
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this country for so long and I I</font>

455
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,680
live and breathe everything about

456
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,970
America and what it stands for so do I

457
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,420
wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> to visit Arrakis up someday</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope</font>

458
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,410
so I you know but with Iraq with how

459
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:56,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">things are in Iraq today I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid my</font>

460
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,250
life would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in danger if I go back so</font>

461
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,590
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't feel safe enough to go back to</font>

468
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,670
is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is what can folks who</font>

469
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,770
are out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there watching this on do to</font>

470

internationally if they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

476
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think folks in the United States</font>

477
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,710
should spend a little more time to meet

478
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">these individuals to learn about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

479
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,180
meet them face to face like we were

480
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,310
discussing learn about why they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

481
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,900
stay in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. why do they want to</font>

482
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,060
become Americans eventually in the

483
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,760
future what what are they contributing

484
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,710
right now to life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the US and for</font>

internationally I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> look there's in</font>

486
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,720
Syria just today over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 million people</font>

Iraq<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's over 3.2 or something in</font>

489
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,090

494
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,660
