as election 2016 degenerates from clownish buffoonery masking tragic depths of dysfunction to even more clownish buffoonery masking even more deeply tragic deeper depths of even more dysfunction many people have begun asking some very important questions where can I catch the next bus back to the 1950s well socialism come to America or can we just go to Venezuela and starve to death there and after you've called someone a conservative globalist cosmopolitan and deep state neocon have you run out of synonyms for Jui but perhaps the question troubling voters the most is have journalists in the mainstream media become such corrupt mendacious Democrat hacks determined to deceive and hoodwink the public by replacing the honest truth with a wholly delusional narrative that they have sanitized Hillary Clinton's obvious criminality while depriving Donald Trump of a fair chance to get his message out or is Trump just kind of a Schmo Trump says it's the fault of the press he told the Daily wire quote I have been totally victimized by a corrupt news media that has given me billions of dollars worth of free coverage so everyone can see what a total blockhead I am I haven't spent any money on advertising so if the crooked media had simply not covered me then no one would know what I was like and I would win by a landslide so much of what the media reports is utterly and completely untrue like saying that Ted Cruz's father helped assassinate President Kennedy what sort of total idiot would believe nonsense like that but suddenly when it comes to me they start telling the truth which makes me look like some sort of total idiot it's just not fair unquote Hillary Clinton was interviewed about media fairness by ABC's chief political correspondent George Stephanopoulos who peppered her with tough questions including are you comfortable my darling can I get you anything is that coffee too cold would you like me to make you another cup and can't we end this farce and simply declare I love to the world mrs. Clinton's answers were yes yes a little okay and quiet you passionate fool Huma we'll hear you though not necessarily in that order Stephanopoulos did finally ask mrs. Clinton about the rumors that are health is failing mrs. Clinton answered by falling down a flight of stairs coughing up a bloody hairball and then spasming uncontrollably for several minutes after which she responded quote don't be ridiculous I'm his weak field as an electric blanket under cosmic Tinkertoys the incident was reported in the New York Times a former newspaper under the headline sexist Republicans claim a woman is not strong enough to be President while she's suffering from a massive brain tumor but whether the news media are corrupt and Donald Trump is a buffoon or whether Donald Trump is a buffoon and it's the news media that's corrupt there are some things that are certain Donald Trump is a buffoon and the news media are corrupt and Hillary Clinton is a flaming crap stick so the election continues on its usual course trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right that's day one without cracking up and you know by the way we've been hearing some complaints besides your complaints

you really okay alright so Donald Trump who you may remember from our last show we actually didn't talk about Donald Trump yesterday how much was it such a relief I don't know but he took some time out the between you know periods of sticking his foot in his mouth and tripping over his tongue and falling over himself he took some time out to make what I thought was a very fine speech about fighting Isis I mean I would give it an a-minus and I am a tough grader so I mean it's not to say it's an a-minus doesn't mean that I'm taking anything away from it I thought it had some flaws in it as you know is for his philosophy has some flaws in it but it was really strong stuff and he started out the thing that I really liked about it is he started out right away and framed this as a war of ideas he started out by saying in the twentieth century the United States defeated fascism Nazism and communism now a different threat challenges our world radical Islamic terrorism and he went on to talk about the way Ronald Reagan posed the the Cold War the fight with the Soviet Union has a fight of ideologies and if you remember back in those days that was just as untenable to the media and the left as it is to talk about radical Islam when Ronald Reagan said the Soviet Union is an evil empire the press went nuts he was a war monger he was an idiot he was a buffoon he was a you know a jingoist patriot so now Trump harkens back to those days play number one in winning the Cold War President Ronald Reagan repeatedly touted the superiority of freedom over communism and called the USSR the evil empire yet when President Obama delivered his address in Cairo no such moral courage could be found or would be found instead of condemning the oppression of women and gays in many Muslim nations and the systematic violations of human rights or the financing of global terrorism President Obama tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights record and remember this our human rights and theirs the records are unbelievable and unmistakable his naive words were followed by even more naive actions the failure to establish a new Status of Forces Agreement in Iraq and the election driven timetable for withdrawal surrendered our games in that country and led directly to the rise of Isis fact-check true all through Trump is always at his best when he's diagnosing the problem he's always as at his best when he's calling out people for the mistakes they've made always weaker when he starts to propose his own programs especially when it gets down to details especially when he gets into that I alone can solve nonsense I mean this is a complex problem to fight a war it is a war that is an ideological war but is not against a nation state is a very very difficult thing to do this is a poison that reaches out into our country that reaches out through computer screens it reaches out through ideas through YouTube and and captures people and you know President Obama falsely calls these lone wolf attackers they're not lone wolf attackers they're people who have caught this disease you know an idea is like a disease sometimes for good or ill you know sometimes for good a good idea can make people healthier and spread spread around the world spread to people the idea of freedom remember when America started it was the only Republic on earth and now you know everybody even if you're a bad country you have to call yourself a republic that's because of the success of the United States of America that's a good idea spreading the bad idea is Islam and Trump is absolutely right he's absolutely right in his diagnosis of what Obama did wrong he left out the fact that Obama sat around while Syria went up in flames you know drawing his red line that he never drew you know I didn't draw the red line but I draw a red line but I don't draw a red line you know that that kind of stuff he left that up but that's okay you know he really did get it now so then he goes on and he talks about his opposition to the Iraq war and this is it's political nonsense but I would say it's the kind of nonsense we expect from our politicians the the Iraq war is now unpopular Trump did at one point say that he thought this was a waste of time it was for nothing it obviously was not for nothing it obviously had a point in purpose Sodom Hussein was a terrible terrible human being he was doing terrible things he was a funding terrorism in the region the question of whether he had weapons of mass destruction I mean we know he had some weapons of mass destruction but it does it does seem that he didn't have the program that people thought he might have been developing when he continually kept inspectors out but he did continually keep inspectors out parading himself not a bad thing that Donald the Donald Trump that none of this bad thing that Sodom Hussein is gone but the war I feel was just badly run that George W Bush because of his loyalties to his staff let them go on before he had that surge and when he finally stood up for his own vision of the thing and have the surge he won the war that's what he's talking about that is what Obama when Obama didn't negotiate a Status of Forces Agreement that's what Trump is talking about Obama let that victory go and whether or not we should have been in the warm we shouldn't certainly should have financed the war which we didn't we allowed the war to just attack itself on to the debt whether we should have gone in that war the war was won when Obama took office no Americans were being killed the month before he took office and he just abandoned that territory and there's just no question about that so Trump is right okay so now he phrases this thing as a battle of ideas and now he puts forward a sort of I won't call it a specific plan but an idea of a coalition fight and he sort of takes back he reframes will say his opposition to NATO and his criticism of NATO by saying NATO has essentially responded to it we cannot always choose our friends but we can never fail to recognize our enemies as president I will call for an international conference focused on this goal we will work side by side with our friends in the Middle East including our greatest ally Israel we will partner with King Abdullah of Jordan and the president of Egypt president Sisi and all others who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished we will also work very closely with NATO on this new mission I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism since my comments they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats very good very very good those trumpism is very good very good now I again I just want you to notice though that he talked about he talked about working with moderate Muslim states and modern moderate Muslim people once again framing this as a war of ideas which unquestionably is what it is and compare that to what Obama was doing yesterday yesterday the u.s. transferred 15 Guantanamo Bay detainees to the United Arab Emirates on the the largest such movement of prisoners yet and President Barack Obama's push to remove most prisoners from the offshore prison before he leaves office in January so these guys this is this place we have on our territory offshore basically on Cuba offshore the u.s. territory but we can house these monsters without putting him back into the system without putting him back on the battlefield without giving them over to Muslim States Obama is obsessed with emptying this thing out because he said he would do it he wants to do what everything that he said he would do it doesn't matter to him just like he surged in Afghanistan for no reason just as he got our troops killed in Afghanistan for absolutely no benefit he is living in this fantasy we'll try to get back to his ideology in a moment but he does not understand because of his own ideology he does not understand that he is opposing an ideology and he doesn't know what ideology his opposing because he's thinking he's playing a different game he's playing he's playing a game of chess of you know they say he's good so smart he's playing 16 dimensional chess he is but he's playing it by himself he's not doesn't know who's on the other side of those 16 dimensions so this is the thing about Trump that I really liked about this speech it was all about ideas it was not about demonizing persons it was not about playing to that section of trumps base that wants to hear the rage that wants to hear the atria that wants to hear you know these guys are awful we've got to do something about this you know he actually was phrasing it in terms of ideas even even when he got to the part that made all the headlines which is about immigration because this is his crowd-pleasing stuff this is the stuff people want to hear we're not gonna have have Syrians being you know dumped on us we're not gonna have I mean after all this crisis in Syria is Obama's fault to some degree or at least his responsibility to have all these people who have been shipped into Germany you are now molesting their women to have them all shipped in here without any kind of vetting procedure you know that's not fair today they do vet them but without proper vetting procedures and why so many and how can we accommodate them without ever thinking about those questions so Trump gets to this but again he puts it in terms of ideas and this is what got all the headlines in the Cold War we had an ideological screening test the time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today I call it extreme vetting I call it extreme extreme vetting our country has enough problems we don't need more and these are problems like we've never had before in addition to screening out all members of the sympathizers of terrorist groups we must also screen out any of hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law those who do not believe in our Constitution or who support bigotry and hatred will not be admitted for immigration into our country okay we're gonna bet this in just a second we have to say goodbye to our friends at Facebook so bring on the dancing girls now all the fun begins but you're gonna hear the rest of the daily water
