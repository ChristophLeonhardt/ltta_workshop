PREFER.
THE ONLY REASON THAT'S HAPPENING
IS ALL THE CANDIDATES MOST
LIKELY TO BE ELECTED ARE RUNNING
ON AN ANTI-TRUMP PLATFORM.
THEY HAVE OTHER PARTS OF THEIR
PLATFORM, AS WELL, BUT PART OF
THEIR APPEAL IS THAT THEY ARE
THE ANTI-TRUMP AND SEEN AROUND
THE WORLD.
IT IS NOT A POSITIVE OUTCOME.
>> EARLIER WE WERE SPEAKING WITH
DR. PAK ON EAST ASIA STUDIES,
SHE FELT THERE WAS WIGGLE ROOM
TO COME BACK TO THE TABLE FOR
TWO REASONS, NOT ONLY DOES THE
PRESIDENT SAY IF YOU CHANGE YOUR
MIND YOU CAN GIVE ME A CALL OR
WRITE ME, BUT ALWAYS BECAUSE THE
MOST HEATED RHETORIC WE'VE BEEN
HEARING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION
AND FROM NORTH KOREA HAS NOT
BEEN COMING FROM THE TWO
LEADERS.
THEYVE BEEN COMING FROM THEIR
VARIOUS UNDERLINGS AND IF
THERE'S ONE THING WE SORT OF
KNOW ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
THERE'S SORT OF PERSON-TO-PERSON
CONNECTION THAT HE LIKES,
FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS AND HE
CERTAINLY GIVES THE IMPRESSION
THAT HE BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT,
PERHAPS THERE'S CHARM DEFENSE
THAT ISN'T THERE IN HIS TWITTER
FEED.
I WANT TO ASK YOU, ALEX, DO YOU
THINK THERE'S SOME WIGGLE ROOM,
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE MUCH OF THE
HEATED RHETORIC IS NOT COMING
FROM THE TWO LEADER, BUT COMING
FROM PEOPLE WITH THEIR
ADMINISTRATIONS?
>> THE TRUMP LETTER CERTAINLY
OPENED THAT POSSIBILITY AND
DRIVES THE BALL SQUARELY INTO
KIM JONG-UN'S COURT.
TRUMP'S STYLE, AND TRUE SINCE HE
WAS A REAL ESTATE MAGNET IN NEW
YORK IN THE 1980s IS JUST GET ME
INTO THE ROOM WITH THE GUY AND I
CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.
ANOTHER KEY ASPECT OF THE
NEGOTIATING STYLE IS HE SAYS
HE'S WILLING TO WALK AWAY FROM
THE TABLE IF HE DOESN'T LIKE
WHAT HE SEES.
THAT PAY WORK IF YOU'RE
CONSTRUCTING CASINOS AND
SKYSCRAPERS IN MANHATTAN.
THIS LEVEL OF INSTRUCTURAL
COMPLICITY, IT MAY NOT WORK.
YOU CAN SEE THE IN THE LANGUAGE
OF THE LETTER THEY'RE LEAVING AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR KIM TO RESPOND
AND BEAT THE PATH BACK TO TRUMP.
TRUMP SEEMS TO BE EXACTING KIM
WILL TONE DOWN AND APOLOGIZE.
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S KIM'S
STYLE, BUT THE OPENING IS
CERTAINLY THERE.
>> THAT'S THE QUESTION, RIGHT?
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO LEADERS
WHO HAVE SIMILAR TENDENCIES TO
BLUSTER IN PUBLIC, BUT IF THIS
WAS SAY SURPRISE TO CHAIRMAN
KIM, THEN YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT
JUST FOR SAVING FACE WITHIN HIS
OWN NATION, THE THING THAT
ALEX --
>> THESE ARE TWO MEN THAT IMAGE
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM.
>> IT'S NOT JUST THE IMAGE.
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM BUT
ALEX YOU CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THIS.
HE IS A YOUNG LEADER.
HE HAS PROVEN ACCORDING TO MIKE
POMPEO HE'S VERY ADEPTH AT
UNDERSTANDING THE CONCERNS AND
HE'S A YOUNG, UNTRUSTED LEADER
OF FAMILY MEMBERS HE HAS TO LIVE
UP TO AND HE'S SURROUNDED BY
PEOPLE, THEN THERE'S A LOT OF
PALACE ENTRY AND WE MAY NOT BE
THAT AWARE OF IT, BUT THERE IS A
LOT OF PALACE ENTRY WITHIN NORTH
KOREA, PROBABLY CERTAIN FACTIONS
WHO DON'T SEE HIM AS A VARIABLE
LEADER.
I WONDER HOW THIS WILL PLAY?
TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THE
REST OF THE COUNTRY.
NORTH KOREA WILL TELL PEOPLE
WHATEVER THEY THINK THEY NEED TO
KNOW AND THEY MAY NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE BUT I
WONDER INTERNALLY WITHIN THE
PALACE HOW THAT'LL PLAY.
>> FOR A MOMENT WHEN YOU SAID AN
UNTUFTED, UNPROVEN LEADER WITH
LOTS OF PALACE INTRIGE, I
THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
THE WHITE HOUSE.
TO YOUR POINT, CERTAINLY THERE
ARE LOTS OF THINGS GOING ON
WITHIN THE NORTH KOREAN
LEADERSHIP WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT,
BUT ONE -- IF PEOPLE AROUND
KIM -- KIM, LET'S BE HONEST, HE
KILLED LOTS OF PEOPLE IN ORDER
TO ESTABLISH HIS POWER, RIGHT?
SO HE CERTAINLY PRESUMABLY
HASSEN MES WITHIN THE REGIME AND
AROUND HIM -- HAS ENEMIES AROUND
HIM AND NORTH KOREA.
IF THE YOUNG LEADER, AS YOU SAY,
APPEARS TO BE NOT HANDLING THIS
WELL, THAT COULD CREATE A
FISSURE FOR OFFICIALS AND THEIR
POWER.
I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON NORTH KOREA
ITSELF, BUT ANY SITUATION IN
WHICH YOU HAVE AN AUTHORITARIAN
LEADERSHIP THAT IS LOSING THE
PLOT OR SLIPPING ON A KEY ISSUE
OF NATIONAL SECURITY LIKE THIS,
CERTAINLY CREATES OPENINGS FOR
OTHERS TO TRY TO FILL THE GAP OR
DO IT BETTER.
>> WE'RE JUST REMINDING EVERY WE
ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM THE
PRESIDENT.
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT TEN
MINUTES AGO OR SO.
CLEAR HE'S RUNNING BEHIND BUT
THE EXPECTATION IS WE'LL HEAR
FROM HIM DIRECTLY.
EARLIER TODAY, SECRETARY OF
STATE MIKE POMPEO WAS
TESTIFYING.
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT
BUDGET NEEDS BUT INSTEAD OF
COURSE MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT
NORTH KOREA.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MIKE
POMPEO SAID WAS THAT THE
PRESIDENT INDICATED HE DIDN'T
LIKE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE HE WAS
HEARING FROM NORTH KOREA, BUT ON
THE INSIDE, WHERE ALL THE WORK
WAS BEING DONE, THAT THE
SECRETARY OF STATE WAS PUTTING
TOGETHER -- THEY WERE PUTTING
TOGETHER TEAMS TO GO FORWARD
WITH THE SUMMIT AND THE LAST FEW
DAYS THEY SIMPLY STOPPED HEARING
FROM NORTH KOREA.
THAT WAS ALSO PART OF THE REASON
WHY WE'RE SEEING -- WE'RE SEEING
THE U.S. PULL OUT OF THIS AT
LEAST FOR NOW.
SO ALEX, ASK YOU, IS THAT SORT
OF SURPRISING TO YOU THAT THE
NORTH KOREANS WOULD BE AT LEAST
LACK LUSTER WHEN IT COMES --
WHEN IT CAME TO REALLY SORT OF
FINALIZING DETAILS OF THE
SUMMIT?
>> IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW
EXACTLY THE PROCESS, THE
DIPLOMATIC PROCESS THAT WAS
GOING ON.
TO MARKOS' POINT, IT WASN'T
CLEAR THERE WAS A CONCERTED AND
SUBSTANTIVE EFFORT TO GO ABOUT
THE PREPARATIONS IN THE KIND OF
WAY THEY NORMALLY ARE, SO -- BUT
LOOK, CLEARLY SOMEONE AND
PROBABLY PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES
DROPPED THE BALL AND NOW WE ARE
WHERE WE ARE.
>> ALL RIGHT, ALEX THANK YOU, MY
FRIEND, FROM THE EURASIA GROUP,
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
MARKOS WE'LL CONTINUE AND WAIT
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO APPROACH
THAT PODIUM AND MAKE SOME
REMARKS.
THIS OF COURSE AFTER HE FIRED
OFF A LETTER FROM JUST ABOUT TWO
HOURS AGO, INFORMING KIM JONG-UN
THE DICTATOR OF NORTH KOREA,
THAT HE IS CANCELING THE
PROPOSED SUMMIT THAT WAS TO TAKE
PLACE ON JUNE 12th, IN
SINGAPORE.
IN THE LETTER HE SAYS HE'S DOING
THIS QUOTE ON THE TREMENDOUS
ANGER AND OPEN HOSTILITY
DISPLAYED IN YOUR MOST RECENT
STATEMENT.
HE DOES, MARKOS, LEAVE THE DOOR
OPEN TO PERHAPS RESTARTING THIS
DISCUSSION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT
THEY'RE EVEN GOING TO HAVE A
SUMMIT, AT ONE POINT SAYING IF
YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND HAVING TO
DO WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT
SUMMIT, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE
TO CALL ME OR WRITE.
IT JUST IS STRIKING AND PEOPLE
ARE STARTING TO REACT TO THE
LETTER ITSELF AND THE WAY THAT
IT WAS WRITTEN.
AT ONE POINT, HE WRITES HERE,
MARKOS, HE SAYS IN THAT, I'LL
QUOTE THE LETTER BECAUSE I THINK
IT'S INTERESTING, PLEASE LET
THIS LETTER SERVE TO REPRESENT
THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT FOR THE
GOOD OF BOTH PARTIES BUT TO THE
DETRIMENT OF THE WORLD WILL NOT
TAKE PLACE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT
MEANS "FOR THE GOOD OF BOTH
PARTIES BUT TO THE DETRIMENT OF
THE WORLD?"
>> THE INTERESTING POLICY IS
"CALL ME MAYBE."
WHAT HE MEANS IS HE SEES IT HOW
HE WAS GOING TO PROVIDE KIM WITH
SECURITY GUARANTEED, IT SEEMED
TO BE A PROMISE OF ECONOMIC
SUPPORT, AND MAYBE INVESTMENT IN
NORTH KOREA, I THINK HE
PERCEIVED THIS WAS GOING TO BE A
FOR NORTH KOREA.
THE REGIME, AND SECURITY, FOR
THE UNITED STATES, ANY WIN FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PERCEIVED AS
A WIN BY HIM BY THE UNITED
STATES.
HE DOESN'T NECESSARILY PERCEIVE
GIVING AWAY CERTAINLY THINGS ARE
A LOSS FOR THE UNITED STATES.
ANYTHING THAT HE CAN CONCEIVE OF
AND PERCEIVE OF AND SELL IS A
POLITICAL WIN FOR HIM AND HIS
PRESIDENCY, IS A WIN FROM HIS
PERSPECTIVE FOR THE UNITED
STATES.
HE MAY HAVE GIVEN AWAY AN AWFUL
LOT.
WE STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS,
VLAD BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED THE
ROLE OF THE CHINESE WITHIN THE
NEGOTIATIONS.
SENATOR RUBIO IS ONE OF THOSE
WHO SUED THIS, THE ZTE DEAL, THE
ONE WHERE THERE IS A TECHNOLOGY
TRANSFER TO THIS CHINESE COMPANY
THE UNITED STATES IS CONSIDERED
A SECURITY -- A NATIONAL
SECURITY THREAT, THAT IN FACT
PART OF THAT DEAL WAS ON THE
TABLE IN ORDER TO ENTICE NORTH
KOREA TO ENTER INTO THESE
NEGOTIATIONS.
AS WE LOOK AT THE PICTURE RIGHT
NOW THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN THE
WHITE HOUSE, WITH SECRETARY
MNUCHIN, IN THE BACKGROUND, WE
HAVE TO WONDER WHAT HE WAS
NEGOTIATING WHEN HE WAS IN
BEIJING?
WAS THERE A DIRECTION AND
DIRECTIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE,
FROM THE PRESIDENT, TO MAKE SURE
THAT HE CAN NEGOTIATE CERTAIN
ASPECTS OF THE TRADE DEAL OR THE
DEFICIT DEAL WE'RE TRYING TO CUT
WITH THE CHINESE IN ORDER TO
ENTICE AND MOVE KIM TOWARDS
THESE NEGOTIATIONS.
A LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.
THE NEGOTIATIONS I THINK AS YOU
SAID ARE STILL ON THE TABLE, IN
SOME FORM, AND MAYBE KIM WILL
WRITE OR CALL.
>> OKAY.
SO MARKOS, WHAT ABOUT THIS MAYBE
BEING A WIN FOR KIM JONG-UN IN A
WAY?
HE GETS TO KEEP HIS NUCLEAR
ARSENAL, ON THE WORLD STAGE, HE
BEING LOOKS REASONABLE.
HE WAS CERTAINLY LOOKING PRETTY
REASONABLE WHEN HE HAD THAT
SUMMIT WITH THE PRESIDENT OF
SOUTH KOREA.
THEY LOOKED SORT OF CHUMMY AND
JOVIAL.
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S
THE U.S. THAT PULLED AWAY FROM
THE SUMMIT.
NORTH KOREA REALLY HASN'T GIVEN
UP MUCH IN EXCHANGE FOR HAVING
THAT VALIDATION ON THE WORLD
STAGE.
MAYBE THIS WORKS OUT A LITTLE
BIT FOR HIM.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
IN FACT, I WAS ON ONE OF YOUR
PROGRAMS A FEW WEEKS BACK WHEN
THIS WAS FIRST ANNOUNCED WAS KIM
GOT EVERYTHING HE NEEDED.
HE GOT INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY,
HE GOT THE PRESIDENT TO --
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO SAY NICE
THINGS ABOUT HIM, CALL HIM AN
HONORABLE MAN, HE WAS ABLE TO
ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE
WORLD COMMUNITY, HE WAS SEEN AS
SOMEONE WILLING TO DO WHAT NO
OTHER NUCLEAR POWER HAS DONE,
WHICH IS CONSIDER GIVING UP
THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
LET ME TAKE THAT BACK.
THERE HAVE BEEN COUNTRIES THAT
HAVE GIVEN THEM BACK, UKRAINE
AND KAZAKHSTAN GAVE UP THEIR
ÃºWEF
THE -- FOLLOW THE SOVIET UNION,
BUT NO COUNTRY SINCE THEN, THAT
HAS NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES HAS
BEEN WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR
NUCLEAR WEAPON.
SUDDENLY KIM IS ON THE WORLD
STAGE LOOKING LIKE A GREAT
LEADER AND AS SOMEONE WHO IS
REASONABLE AND HE'S ABLE TO
MAINTAIN HIS REPRESSIVE REGIME,
THE TYPE CONTROL THAT HE HAS ON
ALL OF THAT STATE, MAINTAIN
WHATEVER IT IS THAT ALLOWS HIM
TO BE CONSIDERED A DAITY IN HIS
OWN COUNTRY AND AT THE SAME TIME
HE'S ABLE TO OPEN NEGOTIATIONS
WITH SOUTH KOREA AND TRY TO
COOPT THE COUNTRY TO THE SOUTH,
WHICH HE IS HOLDING SOUTH WITH
THE WEAPONS THAT HE HAS POINTED
AT THEM AND SAYING WITH LOOK,
LET'S GET TOGETHER, FORGET ABOUT
THE AMERICANS.
LET'S WORK THINGS OUT BETWEEN US
BECAUSE HE IS SUDDENLY GIVEN
THIS AMAZING LEGITIMACY ON THE
WORLD STAGE.
>> MARKOS KOUNALAKIS, FOR
McCLATCHY, THANK YOU FOR JOINING
US.
HE PUT IN HIS LETTER KIM JONG-UN
SHOULD CALL OR WRITE HIM, SINCE
JARED KUSHNER RECEIVED HIS
SECURITY CLEARANCES, I'M
EXPECTING THE MIDDLE EAST
PROCESSES TO START BACK UP.
IT WILLING INTERESTING.
>> WE'VE SEEN THAT BEING A
PATTERN WITH THIS
ADMINISTRATION, THAT OFTENTIMES
THERE IS A LOT OF FOCUS ON AN
INVESTIGATION, OR WHATEVER THE
PRESIDENT IS INTERESTED IN AT
THE TIME, AND IT JUST SORT OF
DISAPPEARS INTO THE ETHER AND WE
DON'T LAWYER ANYTHING MORE ABOUT
IT AGAIN AND I WONDER TO
MYSELF -- DON'T HEAR ANYTHING
MORE ABOUT IT AGAIN AND I WONDER
WHAT WILL BE THE FOCUS.
>> RIGHT.
THE FACT THIS IS A DIFFICULT
NEGOTIATION WITH AN ADVERSARY,
SOME WOULD CALL IT AN ENEMY OF
THE UNITED STATES AND IT MAY
PROVE TO BE JUST AS DIFFICULT.
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW IT PLAYS
OUT.
MARKOS, THANK YOU, WE APPRECIATE
IT.
ALL RIGHT.
HE HAS LEFT.
EARLIER WE WERE SPOKING TO DR.
JUNE PAK, A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE
BROOKINGS INSTITUTE.
WE HAD A DISCUSSION WITH HER.
LET'S PLAY A LITTLE BIT.
>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
NOTE IT WASN'T KIM JONG-UN WHO
CANCELED THE MEETING AND THAT IT
WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO CANCELED
THE MEETING.
THAT PUTS THE OWNOUS OF STOPPING
THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.
KIM HAS LET HIS DEPUTIES AND HIS
LIEUTENANTS DO THE WAR OF WORDS
FOR THE MOST PART, AND HE HAS
STAYED ABOVE THE FRAY IN THE
SCENARIO.
>> THAT'S AN INTERESTING POINT.
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IN FACT IS
BECAUSE THIS LETTER CAME
DIRECTLY FROM THE OFFICE OF THE
PRESIDENT, AND SIGNED BY THE
PRESIDENT, THIS WAR OF WORDS HAS
BEEN EITHER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE
MAKING SOME COMMENTS TO FOX
NEWS, OR UNDERLINGS UNDER KIM
JONG-UN, AND BY THE PRESIDENT
SENDING THIS LETTER YOU THINKS
THAT'S A DIFFERENT MESSAGE THAN
ONE UTILIZING THE SECRETARY OF
STATE FOR EXAMPLE?
>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
THERE'S STILL -- THAT STILL
LEAVE SOME SPACE FOR THE MEETING
TO LEAVE SOME SPACE.
IT WAS A CANCELATION BUT NOT A
CANCELATION IF THAT HE SPOKE SO
HIGHLY ABOUT WHAT HE WAS LOOKING
FORWARD TO THE DIALOGUE AND ONLY
YOU AND I CAN SALVE THIS PROBLEM
AND IT'S TOO BAD -- SOLVE THIS
PROBLEM AND IT'S TOO BAD WE
CAN'T WORK THIS OUT SO I THINK
THERE'S STILL AN OPENING BECAUSE
KIM HAS NOT RESPONDED, IN SOME
OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN
COMING FROM NORTH KOREA HAVE NOT
BEEN COMING FROM KIM DIRECTLY,
SO I STILL THINK THERE'S STILL
SOME WIGGLE ROOM FOR A
POSTPONEMENT OR INDIVIDUAL
RESETTING OF ANOTHER DATE.
>> SO DO YOU THINK THIS LETTER,
THIS CANCELATION, IS JUST SORT
OF MORE TACTICS, MORE SORT OF
ART OF THE DEAL, LIKE WHEN THE
PRESIDENT SAYS WE'RE GOING TO
RIP UP NAFTA AND HE SAYS WE'LL
RENEGOTIATE NAFTA.
DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
SEEING HERE?
>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
NOTE WHAT KIM MIGHT BE SEEING
FROM HIS VANTAGE POINT.
I THINK THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION'S MESSAGE ON WHAT
IT PLANS TO SAY AND BRING UP AND
WHAT THEIR GOALS ARE FOR THE
ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN PRETTY
MUDDLED WITH THE NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISOR BOLTON SAYING
ONE THING, MIKE POMPEO STAYING
ONE THING ABOUT ECONOMICS.
SO I THINK WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP
SAYING WHETHER THE LIBYA MODEL
WAS OUT OR LIBYA MODEL IS IN, SO
IT'S BEEN A MISH-MOSH OF
ADMINISTRATION, SO THERE ISOINTT
ENTIRELY CLEAR TO ME WHETHER
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE THIS
DECISION ON HIS OWN, OR IF HE
HAS INFORMED THE FOREIGN
MINISTERS WHO FROM EAST ASIA WHO
WERE IN TOWN, AND HOW THIS
DECISION CAME ABOUT IN THE FIRST
PLACE.
>> YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS HOW
KIM JONG-UN IS PERCEIVING THIS.
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE
TIMING.
THE PRESIDENT THANKED KIM
JONG-UN IN THE LETTER FOR
RELEASING THE AMERICANS.
THIS IS THE DAY THAT NORTH KOREA
SAYS THEY ARE DESTROYING THEIR
NUCLEAR TESTING SITE, AND THEY
INVITED WESTERN JOURNALISTS, AS
WELL AS JOURNALISTS FROM SOUTH
KOREA TO WITNESS THE
DESTRUCTION.
WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE LIBYA
MODELLING WITH THE IDEA PROMISES
ARE MAYBE BUT MAYBE NOT KEPT, IT
SEEMS LIKE NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN
FOLLOWING THROUGH TO A CERTAIN
DEGREE, GIVING THE
ADMINISTRATION WHAT THEY ASKED
FOR IN RETURN FOR THIS SUMMIT
AND NOW THE SUMMIT IS AT LEAST
FOR NOW OFF THE TABLE.
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW, I THINK KIM
HAS A COUPLE OF OPTIONS, ONE IS
HE IS BE ANGRY AND PUT HIS FOOT
DOWN AND DIG HIS HEELS IN AND
SHOOT BACK AT PRESIDENT TRUMP
RESTORICALLY, THAT IS.
HE CAN CONTINUE TO PUT ON THE
CHARM IF NOT WITH THE U.S. AND
CONTINUE DOING SO WITH SOUTH
KOREA AND WITH CHINA AND THAT'S
WHAT HE HAS BEEN DOING SINCE
JANUARY, TURNING ON THE CHARM
WITH BEIJING AND SEOUL AS
INSURANCE POLICIES IN CASE THE
SUMMIT WITH THE U.S. PRESIDENT
EITHER FAILS HER DOESN'T GO
THROUGH.
>> ALL RIGHT.
YOU HAVE JUST BEEN LISTENING TO
A CONVERSATION AND HERE COMES
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
HE'S EXPECTED NOW TO SPEAK AT
THAT PODIUM THERE AND THIS OF
COURSE IN THE WAKE OF THAT
LETTER.
LET'S GO TO A SPECIAL REPORT
FRM CBS NEWS.
>> THIS IS A CBS NEWS SPECIAL
REPORT, JOHN DICKERSON IN NEW
YORK.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABOUT TO
SPEAK AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
HIS FIRST COMMENTS SINCE
CANCELING PLANS FOR A SUMMIT
MEETING WITH NORTH KOREAN
DICTATOR KIM JONG-UN.
>> I'D LIKE TO BEGIN SAYING
BASED ON THE RECENT STATEMENT OF
NORTH KOREA, I HAVE DECIDED TO
TERMINATE THE PLANNED SUMMIT IN
SINGAPORE ON JUNE 12th.
MANY THINGS CAN HAPPEN AND A
GREAT OPPORTUNITY LIES AHEAD I
BELIEVE THIS IS A TREMENDOUS SET
BACK FOR NORTH KOREA AND A SET
BACK FOR THE WORLD.
I'VE SPOKEN TO GENERAL MATTIS
AND THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF
AND OUR MILITARY WHICH IS BY FAR
THE MOST POWERFUL ANYWHERE IN
THE WORLD THAT HAS BEEN GREATLY
ENHANCED RECENTLY AS YOU-ALL
KNOW, IS READY IF NECESSARY.
LIKEWISE, I HAVE SPOKEN TO SOUTH
KOREA AND JAPAN AND THEY ARE NOT
ONLY READY SHOULD FOOLISH OR
WRECK LITTLE ACTS BE TAKEN BY
NORTH KOREA, BUT THEY ARE
WILLING TO SHOULDER MUCH OF THE
COSTS OF ANY FINANCIAL BURDEN,
ANY OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED, BY
THE UNITED STATES IN OPERATIONS
IF SUCH AN UNFORTUNATE SITUATION
IS FORCED UPON US.
HOPEFULLY POSITIVE THINK OF
THINGS WILL BE TAKEN PLACE WITH
RESPECT TO THE FUTURE OF NORTH
KOREA.
BUT IF THEY DON'T, WE ARE MORE
READY THAN WE HAVE EVER BEEN
BEFORE.
NORTH KOREA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY
TO END DECADES OF POVERTY AND
OPPRESSION BY FOLLOWING THE PATH
OF DENUCLEARIZATION AND JOINING
THE OPPORTUNITY OF NATIONS AND I
HOPE THAT KIM JONG-UN WILL
ULTIMATELY DO WHAT IS RIGHT, NOT
ONLY FOR HIMSELF, BUT PERHAPS
MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT'S RIGHT
FOR HIS PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING
GREATLY AND NEEDLESSLY.
ALL OF THE KOREAN PEOPLE, NORTH
AND SOUTH, DESERVE TO BE ABLE TO
LIVE TOGETHER IN HARMONY,
PROSPERITY, AND PEACE.
THAT BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL FUTURE
CAN ONLY HAPPEN WHEN THE THREAT
OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS REMOVED.
NO WAY IT CAN HAPPEN OTHERWISE.
IF AND WHEN KIM JONG-UN CHOOSES
TO ENGAGE IN CONSTRUCTIVE
DIALOGUE AND ACTIONS, I AM
WAITING.
IN THE MEANTIME, OUR VERY STRONG
SANCTIONS, BY FAR THE STRONGEST
SANCTIONS EVER IMPOSED, AND
MAXIMUM PRESSURE CAMPAIGN WILL
CONTINUE AS IT HAS BEEN
CONTINUING, BUT NO MATTER WHAT
HAPPENS, AND WHAT WE DO, WE WILL
NEVER, EVER COMPROMISE THE
SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
I WANT TO MAKE THAT
APPROVAL OF $700 BILLION AND 
$716 BILLION NEXT YEAR LARGELY 
DUE TO THE HELP OF A LOT OF THE 
PEOPLE. 
WITH ME TODAY, AND STANDING 
RIGHT HERE. 
WE APPRECIATE THEM. 
WE HAD TO DO THAT FOR OUR 
MILITARY. 
HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING WILL WORK 
OUT WELL WITH NORTH KOREA. 
A LOT OF THINGS CAN HAPPEN. 
INCLUDING THE FACT THAT PERHAPS
, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE 
EXISTING SUMMIT COULD TAKE 
PLACE OR A SUMMIT AT SOME LATER 
DATE. 
NOBODY SHOULD BE ANXIOUS. 
WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT. 
WITH THAT BEING SAID WE HAVE 
SOMETHING ELSE, WHICH I HAVE TO 
TELL YOU, ALL OF YOU CHAIRMAN 
MIKE AND EVERYBODY, THAT WAS A 
BIG DEAL UNTIL THIS CAME UP. 
I DO NOT KNOW WHERE IS MIKE? 
CONGRATULATIONS. 
>> THE PRESIDENT AND THE 
ROOSEVELT ROOM. 
HE SAID THE OPPORTUNITY LIES 
AHEAD POTENTIALLY. 
BUT THEN SPOKE ABOUT HAVING 
GOTTEN IN TOUCH WITH HIS 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE. HE SAID 
THE MILITARY WAS READY AND THE 
ALLIES IN THE REGION WOULD PICK 
UP THE COST IF THERE WAS 
MILITARY ACTION. 
WE WANT TO GO NOW TO MAJOR 
GARRETT WHO IS AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
MAJOR, THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAID 
THE KIM JONG-UN I AM WAITING. 
HE SAID NOBODY SHOULD BE 
ANXIOUS. 
SPEAKING OF COURSE TO AMERICANS.
>> Reporter: WE WANT TO GET 
THIS RIGHT. 
A COUPLE OF THINGS WORTH 
POINTING OUT ABOUT THE LAST 
STATEMENT, IT IS CLEAR THE 
WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN ALL WEEK. 
THERE WAS A SENSE INTERNALLY 
THAT NOT ONLY WERE THE NORTH 
KOREANS BACKING AWAY BUT THE 
ADMINISTRATION ITSELF NEEDED A 
BIT MORE TIME TO PREPARE 
ADEQUATELY. 
JOHN BOLTON DOES NOT HAVE HIS 
TEAM FULLY PREPARED HERE AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
MIKE POMPEO IS BUILDING HIS 
TEAM. 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ENORMOUS 
TASK FOR BOTH OF THOSE TEAMS TO 
ORGANIZE THEMSELVS RAPIDLY 
ENOUGH AND EFFECTIVELY ENOUGH 
TO CARRY ON THE HIGH LEVEL, AND 
HIGH-INTENSITY NEGOTIATIONS 
CONTEMPLATED. 
EVEN BEFORE THE SCHEDULED JUNE 
12 SUMMIT. 
GETTING IT RIGHT BECAME AN 
IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR THIS 
ADMINISTRATION SEPARATE FROM 
THE NORTH KOREAN STATEMENTS. 
WHICH WERE CLEARLY HARMFUL. 
THE PRESIDENT BY TALKING FIRST 
ABOUT THE U.S. MILITARY, AND 
CONSULTING HIS MILITARY 
ADVISORS, EVEN BEFORE 
MENTIONING CONVERSATIONS WITH 
THE SOUTH KOREAN AND JAPANESE 
GOVERNMENT IS SENDING A SIGNAL 
TO THE NORTH KOREANS THAT THIS 
PRESIDENT BELIEVES IT HAS BEEN 
THAT THREAT OF MILITARY ACTION, 
IN A WAY THAT NO PREVIOUS 
AMERICAN PRESIDENT HAS NO 
PUBLICLY STATED, THAT DROVE KIM 
JONG-UN TO THE PRECIPICE OF 
THIS SUMMIT IN THE FIRST PLACE. 
WHETHER OR NOT THE NORTH 
KOREANS SURE THAT. 
WE DO NOT KNOW. 
IT IS NOW GOING BACK TO WHERE 
THE PRESIDENT WAS BEFORE THE 
SUMMIT WAS POSSIBLE. 
WE ARE GOING TO THREATEN WITH 
MILITARY ACTIVITY IF YOU DO NOT 
ABANDON YOUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
PROGRAM. 
THAT IS A REAL PROSPECT. 
WE ARE NOW BACK TO WHERE WE 
WERE THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AGO. 
THE APPLICATION BEING, THE 
RHETORIC MAY HEAT UP. 
IN THE SENSE OF ANXIETY, 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT JUST TOLD THE COUNTRY 
IS LIKELY TO INCREASE. 
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID PEOPLE 
SHOULD NOT GET ANXIOUS. 
WE ARE MORE READY THAN WE HAVE 
EVER BEEN BEFORE. 
MAJOR, PUT YOUR FINGER ON IT IF 
IT IS POSSIBLE. 
WHAT CAUSED THIS? 
YOU MENTIONED THE BELLICOSE 
LANGUAGE. 
MIKE POMPEO SAID THE NORTH 
KOREANS WERE NOT RESPONDING TO 
THE PREPARATIONS NEEDED FOR 
THIS ACTUAL SUMMIT ON THE 12th. 
WHAT WAS THE CAUSE FOR THIS 
CALLING OFF OF THE SUMMIT?
>> Reporter: I DO NOT THINK IT 
WOULD BE ACCURATE TO IDENTIFY A 
SINGLE CAUSE. 
THERE WERE SEVERAL. 
A LACK OF SERIOUSNESS ON THE 
PART OF THE NORTH KOREANS. 
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD 
SHOW UP AND IF THEY WOULD HAVE 
ANYTHING SERIOUS TO TALK ABOUT. 
THE RHETORIC FROM THE NORTH 
KOREANS CANNOT BE DISCOUNTED. 
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE HOLD 
A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE 
PRESIDENTS WORLD. 
WHEN THE NORTH KOREANS CALL HIM 
A POLITICAL DUMMY, THAT IS THE 
KIND OF INSULT THAT NO 
ADMINISTRATION CAN IGNORE. 
WHEN THE NORTH KOREANS AT LEAST 
IMPLY THAT THERE COULD BE SOME 
SORT OF NUCLEAR CONFLICT IT IS 
ONE THAT WE SHOULD POINT OUT, 
AT LEAST IN REGARDS TO THE 
UNITED STATES, THE NORTH 
KOREANS ARE POSSIBLE OF WAGING. 
THAT RHETORIC CANNOT BE 
IGNORED. 
IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL OF THIS 
SHIFTING SENSE OF HOW REAL OR 
UNREAL THESE TALKS MIGHT BE, 
THAT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST 
CONVENIENT OFFRAMP FOR THE 
PRESIDENT. 
IT IS WORTH NOTING THIS 
PRESIDENT HAS OFTEN SAID ABOUT 
DEALS IN GENERAL, SOMETIMES IT 
IS IMPORTANT TO WALK AWAY. 
HE IS WALKING AWAY TO SEE IF 
THESE CAN BE RESTARTED IN A 
DIFFERENT CONTEXT. 
>> THE POINT OF WALKING AWAY, 
GIVE US YOUR SENSE. 
YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF THESE 
THINGS. 
THEY ARE NOT OFTEN NEGOTIATED 
IN PUBLIC. 
THIS ONE HAS BEEN PUBLIC. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ENGAGED. 
HOW IS THAT AFFECTED THE WAY 
THIS HAS GONE FORWARD? 
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT 
JUMPED A LOT OF TYPICAL 
PROCESSES. 
BY AGREEING TO THE SUMMIT 
BEFORE HE HAD A TEAM READY TO 
NEGOTIATE THE UNDERLYING 
DETAILS. 
THIS PRESIDENT DOES MANY THINGS 
THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL 
THAT ARE VERY DIFFERENT. 
WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO 
CONCLUDE IS THOUGH THAT WAS A 
DIFFERENT TECHNIQUE AND HE 
JUMPED WAY AHEAD OF THE 
PROCESS. 
AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT, 
PENTAGON OR NATIONAL SECURITY 
COUNCIL. 
THE RESULTS FOR THIS COUNTRY 
AND ADMINISTRATION BEAR A STARK 
AND STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO 
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS. 
ENGAGEMENT WITH NORTH KOREANS 
THAT APPEARS PROMISING ONLY TO 
END IN DISAPPOINTMENT AND 
FRUSTRATION. 
>> I WANT TO BRING IN ED O'KEEFE
. 
>> Reporter: HE'S OPERATING 
FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH. 
HE HAS TOTAL CONTROL OVER 
FOREIGN POLICY. 
THIS WAS A DECISION HE MADE ON 
HIS OWN. 
WITH EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN 
THIS PRESIDENCY IT CAME IN 
DRAMATIC FASHION. 
THERE WAS A LETTER RELEASED 
THIS MORNING BY THE WHITE HOUSE 
THAT READS LIKE AN EMOTIONAL 
BREAKUP LETTER. 
IT HAS GLOBAL RAMIFICATIONS. 
IN ONE SENTENCE HE SAYS YOU 
TALK ABOUT YOUR NUCLEAR 
CAPABILITIES, BUT OURS ARE SO 
MASSIVE AND POWERFUL THAT I 
PRAY TO GOD THEY WILL NEVER 
HAVE TO BE USED. 
IN THE NEXT SENTENCE, I FELT A 
WONDERFUL DIALOGUE WAS BUILDING 
UP BETWEEN YOU AND ME. 
ULTIMATELY IT IS ONLY THAT 
DIALOGUE THAT MATTERS. 
SOMEDAY I LOOK FORWARD TO 
MEETING YOU. 
YOU CAN SEE THE YANG AND THE 
YANG THERE. 
TRYING TO BE TOUGH BUT ALSO 
LEAVING OPEN THE DOOR TO 
POSSIBLY DOING THIS AGAIN. 
>> TODAY HE SAID THE SUMMIT 
MIGHT HAPPEN AT THE DAY OR AT A 
FUTURE DATE. 
ED O'KEEFE THANK YOU. 
COVERAGE WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY. 
ON OUR LOCAL NEWS STATION IN ON 
THIS CBS STATION. 
AND ON OUR 24 HOUR STREAMING 
NETWORK ON CBSN. 
WE WILL HAVE A FULL WRAP-UP 
TONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS 
WITH JEFF GLOR. 
THIS HAS BEEN A CBS SPECIAL 
NEWS REPORT.  
I AM JOHN DICKERSON, CBS NEWS, 
NEW YORK. 
>>> FOR NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY GO 
TO CBS NEWS.COM. 
>> WE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE 
RELEASE OF THE LETTER. 
THE PRESIDENT NOT ONLY 
REITERATING WHAT WAS IN THE 
LETTER, BUT ALSO DOUBLING DOWN 
IN TERMS OF OUR MILITARY 
COMMITMENT. 
IF NORTH KOREA WAS TO PURSUE 
SOMETHING BEYOND DIPLOMACY. 
>> LET'S GO STRAIGHT TO MAJOR 
GARRETT. 
WHO IS REPORTING FROM THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
MAJOR, IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU. 
IT IS STRIKING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
IN MAKING REMARKS SINCE THE 
LETTER WAS RELEASED. 
IMMEDIATELY SWITCH TO THE 
RHETORIC OF OUR MILITARY BEING 
THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN 
THE WORLD. 
AND THAT THEY STAND THEY ARE 
READY. 
>> Reporter: THAT IS RIGHT. 
THAT EMPHASIS IS IMPORTANT. 
REMARKS LIKE THIS ARE 
CALCULATED IN ADVANCE. 
TO SEND SIGNALS THROUGHOUT THE 
WORLD COMMUNITY. 
BY STARTING WITH I'VE TALKED TO 
THE JOINT STEVE -- CHIEF OF 
STAFF IN THE MILITARY IS READY. 
WE HAVE TALKED TO OUR ALLIES 
IMMEDIATELY IN THE REGION. 
THEY ARE READY TO PAY 
ASSOCIATED COST. 
SHOULD SOMETHING MILITARY HAVE 
TO BE UNDERTAKEN. 
ALL OF THAT AS A PRELUDE TO 
SAYING IF THINGS GET BACK ON 
TRACK A LOT OF PROMISING THINGS 
CAN HAPPEN. 
WHAT DOES THIS TELL US? 
THE THEORY OF THE CASE, THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S THEORY ABOUT 
DEALING WITH NORTH KOREA IS 
THAT THE SUMMIT WAS POSSIBLE 
BECAUSE HE WAS SO AGGRESSIVE 
AND THREATENING MILITARY ACTION 
AS DETERRENCE FOR THE NORTH 
KOREANS OBTAINING WHAT IT 
CLEARLY DOESN'T HAVE YET BUT IS 
WORKING TOWARDS. 
NOT ONLY A NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
CAPABILITY WHICH IT POSSESSES 
BUT THE INTERCONTINENTAL 
BALLISTIC MISSILE TECHNOLOGY 
NECESSARY TO DELIVER IT. 
THAT IS SOMETHING THIS 
PRESIDENT HAS SAID IS 
UNACCEPTABLE AND WILL NOT BE 
TOLERATED IN MILITARY ACTION. 
IT WILL BE USED TO STOP. 
THE CONVERSATION GOES BACK TO 
THAT NOW. 
WHERE WAS THREE OR FOUR MONTHS 
AGO. 
BEFORE PROSPECTS OF THE SUMMIT 
BEGAN TO TAKE SHAPE. 
THEY TOOK SHAPE FIRST QUITE 
INFORMALLY WHEN VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE WENT TO THE OLYMPIC -- 
OLYMPICS. 
SOME OF THAT INFORMAL. 
THE NORTH AND SOUTH KOREANS 
WERE THERE. 
LOTS OF THINGS WERE SUGGESTED 
MIGHT BE POSSIBLE. 
IT WAS THAT STEPPING OFF POINT 
THAT LED TO THE CONVERSATIONS 
ABOUT A POSSIBLE SUMMIT. 
WHEN THE NORTH KOREANS INSULTED 
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE 
CALLING HIM A POLITICAL DUMMY 
AND THREATENING A NUCLEAR WAR 
THEY CANNOT WAGE WITH UNITED 
STATES, THAT WAS EFFECTIVELY A 
RHETORICAL STRAW THAT BROKE THE 
CAMELS BACK. 
LOTS OF OTHER THINGS WERE 
SIGNALING THIS ADMINISTRATION. 
THINGS WERE GETTING OFF TRACK. 
IT WAS BETTER TO GET OUT OF THE 
SUMMIT AND CONTINUE TO PURSUE 
SOMETHING UNLIKELY TO
