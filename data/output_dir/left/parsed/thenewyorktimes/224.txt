“We will make
America great again.”
Donald Trump has changed a
lot about American politics.
He’s changed the news cycle —
“the wild, wild West
Wing"
— the notion of what
separates left and right,
and the idea of what it
means to be presidential.
He’s also changing something
else about politics:
the way it sounds.
“We don’t need to
investigate our president.
We need to arrest Hillary.
Republican Don Blankenship
stands with President Trump.”
That’s Don Blankenship.
He’s a Republican running
for Senate in West Virginia.
And you’ll probably
recognize that rallying cry
from Trump’s
presidential campaign.
Blankenship is hardly the
only one parroting
the president these days.
Here’s Marsha Blackburn, a
congresswoman from Tennessee.
“I’m politically
incorrect and proud of it.”
And Todd Rokita from Indiana,
another candidate for Senate.
“It’s time to build a wall, make
English our official language
and put America first.”
It goes on.
“I believe in building
the wall and stopping
illegal immigration.”
They’re also taking on Trump’s
crude, sometimes profane, tones.
“I’m a fighter pilot,
and I talk like one.
That’s why I told
Washington Republicans
to grow a pair of ovaries
and get the job done.”
It doesn’t always work,
especially if it seems forced.
Josh Hawley, an Ivy League-educated, 
former Supreme Court clerk,
is about as far from
Trump as you can get.
But that didn’t
stop him from trying
to play the part.
“Hollywood
and Wall Street
and the D.C.
political establishment —
they’ve worked together to
rig a system that favors them.”
Strategists question whether
this is a permanent coarsening
of our political dialogue.
But that probably
depends on whether or not
any of these aspiring
leaders get elected.
