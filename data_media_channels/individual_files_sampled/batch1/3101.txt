sometimes you get really nasty answers and that's when you know the person might have an ego it depends on the interview I definitely change it up sometimes based on what the person is interviewing for my company and way up we have these seven company values and one of them is be a master of your craft but know you're not the master which means be really good at what you do but know that there are other people out there who are way better at each of the skills and so go out and find as much information as you can one of the questions I like to ask is tell me about a time when you had to learn something on your own in the workplace or for a class or for a club that was not required but you did it on your own and then use that to it for leverage I sometimes hear some really fascinating stories and it's a great way to learn more about a candidate I definitely have some more tricky ones like if I found someone who didn't like you why would they say they don't like you sometimes you get really nasty answers and that's when you know the person might have an ego like I've heard because they're jealous and that's when I'm like you're probably not going to make it here but yeah I've heard I've heard good answers and it's a nice way to kind of pull out the whole like weakness question without asking it
