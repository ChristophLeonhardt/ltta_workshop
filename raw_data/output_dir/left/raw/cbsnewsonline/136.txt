1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:00,800
IT IS JUST THIS.

00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,634
BUT, YOU MAKE ME FEEL WELCOME. 

3
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:04,370
SO, THAT IS AWESOME. 

4
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,371
I HAVE COME HERE FOR A LONG 

5
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:06,372
TIME, THE STATE MEANS A LOT TO 

6
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:06,538
ME. 

7
00:00:06,538 --> 00:00:07,941
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, I AM A BIG 

8
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,075
SHOOTER AND HUNTER AND 

9
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:10,010
FISHERMAN. 

10
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:16,716
>> THAT IS ALSO WHY I FEEL 

11
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:17,517
RIDICULOUS IN THE SUIT, BUT I 

12
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:17,917
WILL DO IT. 

13
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:18,117
OKAY? 

14
00:00:18,117 --> 00:00:19,452
I HAVE BEEN COMING OUT HERE 

15
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:20,720
SINCE THE FIRST GOT A CAR. 

16
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,826
I WOULD LIVE IN THE BACK OF MY 

17
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:27,627
TRUCK AND FISH ALL THE RIVERS 

18
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:28,194
AND REALLY GOT TO KNOW THE 

19
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:28,427
STATE. 

20
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:29,495
THE REASON I GOT INTO MONTANA 

21
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:30,162
POLITICS WAS BECAUSE I MET YOUR 

22
00:00:30,162 --> 00:00:35,067
SENATOR, STEVE DAINES IN ELK 

23
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:41,541
CAMP. 

24
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,675
I WAS IN ELK CAMP, I BROUGHT MY 

25
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:42,975
LITTLE SON. 

26
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:43,642
THIS WAS THANKSGIVING A COUPLE 

27
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:44,077
OF YEARS AGO. 

28
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,612
MY SIX-YEAR-OLD AT THE TIME, WE 

29
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:46,346
WERE DOING A GOOD LITTLE FAMILY 

30
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:49,716
FATHER SON TRIP AND I RAN INTO 

31
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,116
STEVE. 

32
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:50,583
WE STARTED TO TALK. 

33
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,116
WHAT DO YOU THINK? 

34
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:52,619
DID I SHOOT ONE? 

35
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:52,952
COME ON, MAN. 

36
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:56,156
COME ON. 

37
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:56,790
UNLIKE JOHN TESTER, WHO ONLY 

38
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,957
STARTED BUYING HUNTING TAGS 

39
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,058
WHEN THE GOP CALLED HIM OUT FOR 

40
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:05,598
NOT BEING A HUNTER. YOU KNOW 

41
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:06,566
THAT HE WENT 15 YEARS WITHOUT A 

42
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,133
HUNTING LICENSE, AND HE 

43
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:11,171
PRETENDS LIKE HE IS A HUNTER. 

44
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:11,838
HE WENT 15 YEARS UNTIL HE 

45
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:12,572
CALLED HIM OUT FOR IT. 

46
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,908
THAT IS WHY WE CALL HIM TO FACE 

47
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,208
TESTER. 

48
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,277
YOU CAN'T SAY YOU ARE ONE 

49
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,678
THING, YOU CAN'T SHOW UP IN 

50
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:24,283
BLAZE ORANGE BUT YOU HAVE NOT 

51
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:25,185
BOUGHT A HUNTING LICENSE IN 15 

52
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,452
YEARS, THAT DOES NOT WORK IN 

53
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:28,788
MONTANA, RIGHT? 

54
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:29,656
YOU COULD MAKE THAT WORK IN NEW 

55
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:30,890
YORK CITY, BUT NOT THIS SIDE OF 

56
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:31,558
THE MISSISSIPPI. 

57
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:37,831
SO, I WAS OUT AT HUNTING CAMP 

58
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:38,397
AND WE HAVE THIS GREAT 

59
00:01:38,397 --> 00:01:38,932

60
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:39,532

63
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:48,074
MY SON. 

64
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:48,775
I GOT TO KNOW THIS GUY. 

65
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,742
THAT IS A WAY THAT YOU GET TO 

66
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:50,176
KNOW SOMEBODY. 

67
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,010
NOT IN A BOARD ROOM, NOT ACROSS 

68
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,744
THE TABLE AT NEGOTIATION, NOT 

69
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:52,479
EVEN IN POLITICS. 

70
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,012

73
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,281

75

THEY SAID DON -- WOULD YOU COME 

77
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:06,526
OUT TO MONTANA? 

78
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:11,831
I SAID I AM FROM NEW YORK CITY. 

79
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:12,932
I'M NOT SURE IF I WILL FLY IN 

80
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:13,799
MONTANA, IT TURNS OUT IT WORKED 

81
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:14,133

WE HAD A GREAT TIME, WE REALLY 

83

MOVED THE NEEDLE. 

84
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,504
WE GOT TO DO A LITTLE SHOOTING. 

85
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:19,505
WE EVEN DID SOME PRAIRIE 

86
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:19,805
DOGGING. 

87
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:24,077
BUT BY THE TIME THE NEW YORK 

88
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,211

89
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,179

00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:16,842
A BIG DEAL THESE DAYS. 

189
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:17,476
THEIR FEELINGS, THEN THEY ARE 

190
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:18,077
THE SAFETY AND WELL-BEING OF 

191
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:18,610
OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS. 

192
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,982
AND THAT DOESN'T WORK. 

193
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:23,683
WHEN I LOOK AT THE DEMOCRATIC 

194
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:29,021
PLATFORM, I SAY I DON'T KNOW. 

195
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:29,621
I'M LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS. 

196
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:30,389
I SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. 

197
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:30,889
I SEE ALL-TIME LOW 

198
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:31,223
UNEMPLOYMENT. 

199
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:31,857
THE GREATEST JOB REPORTS EVER. 

200
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:32,691
WHEN THE NEW YORK TIMES SAYS WE 

201
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,894
DO NOT HAVE THE WORDS TO 

202
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,363
DESCRIBE HOW GOOD THESE JOB 

203
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,030
NUMBERS ARE, TRUST ME -- THAT 

204
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,399
WAS NOT EASY FOR THEM TO WRITE. 

205
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,834
THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT, NOT ONE 

206
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,803
LITTLE BIT. 

207
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:44,937
I AM SAYING -- WHAT IS THE 

208
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:45,470
OTHER SIDE'S PLATFORM? 

209
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,773

224

FAVOR OF OXYGEN, THE DEMOCRATS 

225
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:27,813
WOULD SAY WE ARE AGAINST IT. 

226
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:28,648
MAYBE A GOOD TACTIC, I'M JUST 

227
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,482
KIDDING, BECAUSE THEY WILL SAY 

228
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,683
THAT I'M TRYING TO KILL PEOPLE. 

229
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,718
BUT, THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE 

230
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:33,052
GOTTEN, OKAY? 

231
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,821
WHEN I LOOK AT JOHN TESTER AND 

232
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:36,689
THIS RACE, HE SAYS ALL THE 

233
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,326
THINGS HE VOTED FOR TRUMP ON.

00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,060
HE TOOK OUT FULL-PAGE ADS.

00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:45,798
ON JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH?  

237
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,032
WHERE WAS HE ON SANCTUARY

CITIES? 

239
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,304

AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY -- THE 

242
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,310
BIG ONE -- WHERE WAS HE ON TAX

244
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,182
OKAY? 

245
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:03,716
YOU KNOW WHERE HE WAS? 

246
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,650
HE WAS WITH CHUCK SCHUMER AND 

247
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:04,983
NANCY PELOSI. 

248
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:06,252
HE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

MONEY IN YOUR POCKET. 

251

CARE OF FAMILY.

TABLE. 

255
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,196
HE WAS NOT THERE FOR THAT ONE. 

256
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,164
HE SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE 

257
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,266
EXPLETIVE WORST BILLS EVER PUT 

258
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,636

THAT. 

260
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:31,644

OF THESE COMPANIES TO BRING 

262
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:33,044

AGAINST IT.

TICKET IN 2018,  THAT DOES NOT 

290
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:18,925
MEAN THAT EVERYTHING THAT HE 

291
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,059
HAS ACCOMPLISHED IS NOT ON THE 

292
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:20,292
TICKET. 

293
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:21,794
THE OTHER SIDE WANTS TO GET RID

UP TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER.

DIFFERENCE. 

302
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:33,673

OR A FLY ROD, BUT WE WILL DO 

308
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,651

ALL RIGHT? 

317
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:56,495
THAT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS AS 

318
00:09:56,495 --> 00:10:03,936
THEY COME OUT THERE AND THEY 

319
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,503
SAY WE ARE SELLING TALKING

ABOUT? 

321
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:05,371
BUT, THAT IS THE BIG SOUNDBITE 

322
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:05,838
FOR THE OUTDOORSMEN. 

323
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:06,572
THE REALITY IS NOT TRUE BUT 

324
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,573
NOBODY IS GOING TO LOOK BEYOND 

325

THAT.

00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,112
IF YOU MARK REMEMBER WHAT WE 

327
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:13,913
ARE DOING, LOOK AT THE 

328
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:14,180

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,847
DO NOT BUY EVERYTHING THAT YOU 

330
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:15,047
READ. 

331
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,048
ADVERTISING CAN BUY AND SELL A 

332
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:16,982
LOT OF GARBAGE. 

333
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:18,317
VERY TRUE. 

334
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,953
THERE IS A LOT OF IT THESE 

335
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:21,387
DAYS, MAN. 

336
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:21,854
THAT IS THE REALITY. 

337
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,088
THINK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF 

338
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:25,191
WINNING WE COULD HAVE IF YOU 

339
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,092
HAD A LITTLE COOPERATION WITH 

340
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:26,592
THE MEDIA. 

341
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:27,793
IF THEY WERE HALF IS FRIENDLY 

342
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:32,665
TO US, WE DO NOT EVEN NEED ALL 

343
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:33,632
OF THE FRIENDLY THAT THEY WERE 

344
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:34,232
FOR OUR PREDECESSOR WHICH WAS 

345
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:35,434
-- HE COULD DO NO -- NO WRONG. 

346
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,938
IF THEY WERE 1/10 IS FRIENDLY, 

347
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:39,905
YOU GET RID OF THE NONSENSE AND 

348
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:40,806
THE NOISE, THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH 

349
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:45,878
MORE YOU COULD DO. 

350
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:46,979
THAT IS WHY YOU ARE SO 

351
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:47,613
IMPORTANT, THAT IS WHY MONTANA 

352
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:48,113
IS RELEVANT RIGHT NOW. 

353
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:48,881

AND THAT IS WHAT MATT ROSENDALE 

356
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,551

922
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,621
DO IT. 

923
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:57,454
SO, I SORT OF FEEL GUILTY ABOUT 

924
00:35:57,454 --> 00:35:58,055
THIS WHOLE THING. 

925
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,658

00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,763
TO DO IT, I WILL DO IT.

HOW VICIOUS IS THE WORLD?

AND THAT WERE NOT TRUE. 

935
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,247
AND THAT IS PROBABLY WHY I AM 

936
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,349
HERE, BECAUSE I WON MONTANA BY

WILL NEVER HAVE TO USE IT. 

1103
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:12,930
YOU KNOW, THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU 

1104
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:13,964

1105
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:14,198
IT? 

1106
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,365
IF IT IS SO POWERFUL, GOOD, 

1107
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:15,966
STRONG THAT NOBODY WANTS TO 

1108
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:16,266
PLAY GAMES. 

1109
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:17,000
AND, THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING. 

1110
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,969
[ APPLAUSE ] WE WILL NEVER HAVE 

1111
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:24,641

1112
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:26,009
OF COURSE, THEN WE HAVE NORTH 

1113
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:31,015
KOREA, WHERE -- YOU NOTICE 

1114
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,449
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,

1115
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:35,752
IT SEEMED LIKE A MISSILE A 

1116
00:42:35,752 --> 00:42:35,986
WEEK. 

1117
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,121
A LOT OF MISSILES AND ROCKETS 

1118
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,923
GOING UP, A LOT OF NUCLEAR 

1119
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:39,957

1120
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:40,557
THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS AN 

1121
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:42,860
EARTHQUAKE THE SIZE OF SOMETHING

1122
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,727
THEY HAD NEVER TESTED BEFORE. 

1123
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,530
THEY SAID WHERE IS IT? 

1124
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,297
O, IT IS IN KOREA SOMEPLACE. 

1125
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:51,468
THEY SAID WHY DON'T YOU CHECK 

1126
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:51,868
NUCLEAR WEAPONS? 

1127
00:42:51,868 --> 00:42:52,569
IT WAS A NUCLEAR WEAPON, ALL 

1128
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:52,803
RIGHT? 

1129
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:55,806
SO, SINCE THE RHETORIC STOPPED, 

1130
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:56,674
WOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT WAS 

1131
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:57,007
TOUGH, RIGHT? 

1132
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:00,444
SO, REMEMBER, THEY SAID HE IS 

1133
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:00,744
TOO TOUGH. 

1134
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:01,745
HE IS GOING TO CAUSE A WAR. 

1135
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,880
IT IS TOO TOUGH. 

1136
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,114
NOW, THEY SAY HE IS TOO NICE, 

1137
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:05,683
HE IS TOO NICE. 

1138
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:13,390
HE IS TOO NICE. 

1139
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,425
I GOT ALONG VERY NICE WITH 

1140
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,960
CHAIRMAN KIM, I GOT ALONG VERY  

1141
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,493
I GOT ALONG WELL. 

1142
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,495
NOW, WHAT HAS NOT HAPPENED IN 

1143
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:18,896
EIGHT MONTHS? 

1144
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:19,730
FIRST OF ALL, WE GOT OUR 

1145
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,699
PRISONERS BACK BEFORE I EVEN 

1146
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:22,032
LEFT, RIGHT? 

1147
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:30,407
[ APPLAUSE ] AND I DID NOT PAY 

1148
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:31,141
1.8 BILLION BY THE WAY, IN 

1149
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:31,341
CASH. 

1150
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:32,109
WE DID NOT PAID 1.8, RIGHT? 

1151
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,611
WE PAID SLIGHTLY LESS THAN 1.8, 

1152
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:36,046
WE PAID NOTHING. 

1153
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:41,251
AND, YET -- AND YET, IT WAS A 

1154
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:41,818
VERY SMART DEAL FOR NORTH 

1155
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:43,153
KOREA, GOODWILL IS VERY 

1156
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:43,453
IMPORTANT. 

1157
00:43:43,453 --> 00:43:44,420
BUT, WE SIGNED A WONDERFUL 

1158
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,322
PAPER. 

1159
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:46,990
WE SAID THEY ARE GOING TO 

1160
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:51,528
DENUCLEARIZE THEIR WHOLE THING. 

1161
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:52,095
IT IS ALL GOING TO HAPPEN. 

1162
00:43:52,095 --> 00:43:54,231
BUT, NOW -- YOU KNOW, WAS BACK 

1163
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:54,631
IN SIX DAYS. 

1164
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:57,534
WHY HASN'T IT STARTED? 

1165
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:57,734
WHY? 

1166
00:43:57,734 --> 00:43:59,370
WELL, I MEAN -- THESE GUYS -- 

1167
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,939

IT IS 30 MILES OFF THE BORDER. 

1171
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:15,985
AND, THAT IS A TOUGH ORDER, 

1172

THOUSANDS OF CANNONS THEY CALL 

1173
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:16,953

00:44:16,953 --> 00:44:17,654
THESE ARE BIG, BIG GUNS. 

1175
00:44:17,654 --> 00:44:19,056
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR. 

1176
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,156
YOU COULD HAVE LOST 30-50 

1177

MILLION PEOPLE, YOU COULD HAVE 

1178
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:23,761

1179
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:26,363

00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:36,507
MIKE POMPEO  IS OVER THERE 

1185
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,307

THEY ARE THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA.

SO, WHAT DO THEY SAY ALL THE 

1193
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:01,165
TIME? 

1194
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:02,098
BECAUSE, THEY DID NOT GIVE 

1195
00:45:02,098 --> 00:45:02,932
ANYTHING UP. 

1196
00:45:02,932 --> 00:45:05,335
WHAT DID THEY SAY ALL THE TIME? 

1197
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:08,105
THEY SAY HE WENT THERE. 

1198
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:08,705
I WENT THERE. 

1199
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:09,238
I WENT TO SINGAPORE. 

1200
00:45:09,238 --> 00:45:17,014
WE HAD A MEETING. 

1201
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:17,748
BY AGREEING TO MEET, YOU KNOW 

1202
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:18,849
-- THEY CANNOT COME UP WITH 

1203
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:19,516
ANYTHING ELSE -- LIKE, I DID 

1204
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:20,283
NOT GIVE LIKE CLINTON AND LIKE 

1205
00:45:20,283 --> 00:45:22,352
OBAMA WHAT HAVE -- YOU KNOW, 

1206
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:22,819
OBAMA COULD NOT MEET. 

1207
00:45:22,819 --> 00:45:23,754
WELL, HE SAYS THAT OBAMA COULD 

1208
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:24,621
NOT MEET -- THEY WOULD NOT SEE 

1209
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:24,821
HIM. 

1210
00:45:24,821 --> 00:45:26,390
SO, I DID NOT HAVE LIKE CLINTON 

1211
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,724
WHERE THEY HAVE BILLIONS AND 

1212
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,293
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, I GOT 

1213
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:30,928
NOTHING. 

1214
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:33,030
OKAY? 

1215
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:33,597
SO, THEY COULD NOT FIND 

1216
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:33,864
ANYTHING. 

1217
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:36,700
SO, WHAT DO THEY DO? 

1218
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,968
THEY SAY I MET, I MET -- THAT 

1219
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:38,936
IS WHAT WE LOST, FOLKS. 

1220
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:39,169
HE MET. 

1221
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:44,842
NOW, BY THE WAY, OBAMA WOULD 

1222
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:45,542
HAVE LOVED TO HAVE MET. 

1223
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:46,376
THEY WOULD NOT SEE HIM, THEY 

1224
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:47,144
WOULD NOT SEE HIM. 

1225
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:47,811
ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS THAT 

1226
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:48,912
I ASKED WHEN I WAS OVER THERE 

1227
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,480
-- THEY WOULD NOT SEE HIM. 

1228
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,550
SO, I MET, THAT IS HOW WE GOT 

1229
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,220
BEAT AND NOW THEY SAY IT WITH

00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:53,556
WAS BORN IN PUERTO RICO. 

1461
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:55,992
THAT IS OKAY. 

1462
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,427
A GUY SAYS HE WAS BORN IN 

1463
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:58,528
GERMANY BUT HE WAS BORN 

1464
00:54:58,528 --> 00:54:58,895
SOMEPLACE ELSE. 

1465
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,263
I WILL GET ONE OF THOSE LITTLE 

1466
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:00,463
KITS. 

1467
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,098
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DEBATE, 

1468
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,534
WHEN SHE PROCLAIMS THAT SHE IS 

1469
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:06,903
OF INDIAN HERITAGE BECAUSE HER 

1470
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:08,605
MOTHER SAID SHE HAS HIGH 

1471
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:13,076
CHEEKBONES, THAT IS HER ONLY 

1472
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,512
EVIDENCE, WE WILL TAKE THAT 

1473
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,548
LITTLE KIT AND SAY WE HAVE TO 

1474
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,583
DO IT GENTLY. 

1475
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:23,420
WHEN THE ME TOO GENERATION -- 

1476
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,655
WE HAVE TO BE VERY GENTLE. 

1477
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,857
WE WILL VERY GENTLY TAKE THAT 

1478
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:33,163
KIT AND WE WILL SLOWLY TOSS IT, 

1479
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,597
HOPING IT DOES NOT HIT HER AND 

1480
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:35,799
INJURE HER ARM, EVEN THOUGH IT 

1481
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:38,234
ONLY WEIGHS TWO OUNCES. 

1482
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:41,871
WE WILL SAY "I WILL GIVE YOU $1 

1483
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:44,340
MILLION FOR YOUR FAVORITE 

1484
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,542
CHARITY PAID FOR BY TRUMP IF 

1485
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:47,377
YOU TAKE THE TEST AND IT SHOWS 

1486
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,813
YOU ARE AN INDIAN."

1487
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:54,384
[ APPLAUSE ]LET'S SEE WHAT SHE 

1488
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:54,918
DOES. 

1489
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:57,854
I HAVE A FEELING SHE WILL SAY NO

1490
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,389
BUT WE WILL HOLD THAT FOR THE 

1491
00:55:59,389 --> 00:55:59,622
DEBATE. 

1492
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:03,026
KEEP IT WITHIN THIS ROOM. I 

1493
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,461
DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY ANY 

1494
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:04,728
SECRETS. 

1495
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:06,229
THE PRESS IS VERY HONORABLE. 

1496
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:08,498
PLEASE DON'T TELL HER WHAT I 

1497
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:09,365
JUST SAID. 

1498
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:12,969
DEMOCRATS ARE LAUNCHING 

1499
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:13,770
OUTRAGEOUS ATTACKS AGAINST OUR 

1500
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,005
INCREDIBLE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND 

1501
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:16,439
OUR I.C.E. 

1502
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:17,040
AND BORDER PATROL. 

1503
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,476
THEIR NEW PLATFORM FOR THE 

1504
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:23,346
DEMOCRAT PARTY -- BY THE WAY, I 

1505
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:24,380
CALL IT THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. 

1506
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,582
IT SOUNDS THAT ARE. 

1507
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:31,054
I WROTE BEST SELLERS. 

1508
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,089
I GUESS I SPEAK WELL. úWE TURNE 

1509
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:33,322
PEOPLE. 

1510
00:56:33,322 --> 00:56:34,724
THEY NEVER SAY I AM A GREAT 

1511
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:34,991
SPEAKER. 

1512
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:36,826
WHY THE HELL DO SO MANY PEOPLE 

1513
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:40,196
COME? 

1514
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:42,365
WHY DO THEY COME? 

1515
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:57,680
WHY? 

1516
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,082
WHY DO THEY COME? 

1517
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,284
IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING. 

1518
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:03,753
I GUESS THEY LIKE MY POLICY. 

1519
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,788
MAYBE YOU LIKE POLICY. 

1520
00:57:05,788 --> 00:57:08,791
HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED -- YOU 

1521
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:10,660
NEVER HEAR THAT. 

1522
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,095
THERE HAS GOT TO BE A REASON. 

1523
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:16,165
I HAVE BROKEN MORE ELTON JOHN 

1524
00:57:16,165 --> 00:57:16,432
RECORDS. 

1525
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:17,967
HE SEEMS TO HAVE A LOT OF 

1526
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:18,234
RECORDS. 

1527
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:19,202
I DON'T HAVE A MUSICAL 

1528
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:19,502
INSTRUMENT. 

1529
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:30,380
I DON'T HAVE A GUITAR. WE BROKE 

1530
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,615
A LOT OF RECORDS. 

1531
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,017
WE HAVE BROKEN VIRTUALLY EVERY 

1532
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:34,250
RECORD. 

1533
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:41,124
I ONLY NEED THIS FACE. 

1534
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,358
THEY NEED MUCH MORE ROOM FOR 

1535
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:43,459
BASKETBALL, FOR HOCKEY, THEY 

1536
00:57:43,459 --> 00:57:44,193
NEED A LOT OF ROOM. 

1537
00:57:44,193 --> 00:57:44,994
WE DON'T NEED IT. 

1538
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:46,729
WE BREAK ALL OF THESE RECORDS. 

1539
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:50,433
REALLY, WE DO IT WITHOUT THE 

1540
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:51,501
MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS. 

1541
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:54,103
THIS IS THE ONLY MUSICAL -- THE 

1542
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,773
MOUTH. 

1543
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:57,607
AND, HOPEFULLY THE BRAIN 

1544
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:59,208
ATTACHED TO THE MOUTH. 

1545
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:00,243
THE BRAIN IS MORE IMPORTANT 

1546
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:01,244
THAN THE MOUTH. 

1547
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:02,845
THE BRAIN IS MUCH MORE 

1548
00:58:02,845 --> 00:58:04,914
IMPORTANT. 

1549
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:13,022
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD -- THEY SAY 

1550
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:14,223
WE HAD A CASE LAST WEEK. 

1551
00:58:14,223 --> 00:58:15,658
WE WERE IN A GREAT PLACE IN 

1552
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:15,958
WISCONSIN. 

1553
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:18,127
WE HAD A TREMENDOUS CROWD. 

1554
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:19,429
WE HAD A 22,000 SEAT ARENA. 

1555
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:20,897
IN RETROSPECT, WE WOULD HAVE 

1556
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:22,999
ACTED AND THEY WOULD HAVE SENT 

1557
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,000
AWAY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BUT 

1558
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,001
THE VERY INNOCENT PEOPLE SAID 

1559
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:28,371
TO ME -- THEY FILLED UP A 7000 

1560
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:30,306
SEAT ARENA AND WALKED AWAY 

1561
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:34,978
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. WE WOULD 

1562
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:35,378
HAVE FILLED. 

1563
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:36,779
I ASKED WHY THEY DID NOT USE 

1564
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:38,214
THE BIG ARENA AND THEY SAID WE 

1565
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:39,915
KNEW IF YOU HAD FIVE VACANT 

1566
00:58:39,915 --> 00:58:48,124
SEATS, THEY WOULD SAY DONALD 

1567
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:50,626
TRUMP WAS UNABLE TO FILL THE 

1568
00:58:50,626 --> 00:58:52,829
ARENA. 

1569
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:56,099
I SAID YOU ARE RIGHT. 

1570
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,300
HOW ABOUT THE ONE FROM THE 

1571
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:57,700
WASHINGTON POST? 

1572
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,736
THEY GOT THERE FOUR HOURS EARLY 

1573
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:02,138
AND THE ARENA HAD NOT STARTED 

1574
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:05,008
EVEN LETTING PEOPLE IN. 

1575
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,442
THERE WERE JUST A FEW PEOPLE. 

1576
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:09,512
YOU ALL SAW THE STORY I HOPE. 

1577
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:12,081
THEY GOT THERE FOUR HOURS 

1578
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,082
EARLY. 

1579
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:15,752
THIS WRITER DID NOT GET FIRED. 

1580
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:18,788
HE SAID DONALD TRUMP HAD AN 

1581
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:22,291
EMPTY ARENA. EXCEPT, WHEN I 

1582
00:59:22,291 --> 00:59:23,926
SHOWED UP, THE PLACE WAS PACKED 

1583
00:59:23,926 --> 00:59:25,128
AND THEY HAD TO WALK AWAY 

1584
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:29,198
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. 

1585
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:32,468
I DID NOT SEE THIS STORY. 

1586
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,237
YOU KNOW WHO SAW THIS STORY? 

1587
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,471
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE 

1588
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:35,704
ARENA. 

1589
00:59:35,704 --> 00:59:41,277
THEY WENT NUTS. THEY APOLOGIZED.

1590
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,011
YOU KNOW WHAT? 

1591
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:43,312
THEY APOLOGIZED ON TWITTER. 

1592
00:59:43,312 --> 00:59:47,884
THEY HAD TO SAY DONALD TRUMP 

1593
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:49,752
DID NOT HAVE A VERY GOOD CROWD 

1594
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,587
AND THEY SHOW A VERY EMPTY 

1595
00:59:51,587 --> 00:59:52,955
ARENA. 

1596
00:59:52,955 --> 00:59:54,590
BY THE WAY, I HATE TO SAY IT, 

1597
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:55,992
TAKE A LOOK AT THE PICTURES FOR 

1598
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:56,959
THE INAUGURATION. 

1599
00:59:56,959 --> 01:00:01,097
WE HAD SOME MONSTER CROWD. 

1600
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:05,768
A BIG MONSTER. 

1601
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:10,039
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. 

1602
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:11,240
THEY SHOW AN ARENA BEFORE THE 

1603
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,275
PEOPLE STARTED COMING IN. 

1604
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,043
THERE WERE A FEW PEOPLE. 

1605
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:17,346
THEY APOLOGIZED. LET ME JUST 

1606
01:00:17,346 --> 01:00:20,682
TELL YOU, THE DEMOCRATS, WE 

1607
01:00:20,682 --> 01:00:22,451
CALL THEM THE DEMOCRAT PARTY 

1608
01:00:22,451 --> 01:00:23,653
BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY 

1609
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:26,422
SOUNDS TOO GOOD. 

1610
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:31,094
I ALWAYS SAY THE DEMOCRAT PARTY 

1611
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:33,362
AND PEOPLE TELL ME I MADE A 

1612
01:00:33,362 --> 01:00:34,197
MISTAKE. 

1613
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:35,631
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SOUNDS TOO 

1614
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:37,433
GOOD SO I DON'T WANT TO USE IT. 

1615
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:39,836
THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE 

1616
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:42,371
DEMOCRAT PARTY IS TO ABOLISH 

1617
01:00:42,371 --> 01:00:46,175
I.C.E.

1618
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:47,410
. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY WANT TO 

1619
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,044
ABOLISH IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT 

1620
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:48,311
ENTIRELY. 

1621
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,645
THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. 

1622
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:52,682
THEY WANT EVERYBODY COMING IN. 

1623
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:53,916
THE BEAUTY WITH I.C.E. 

1624
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:56,152
IS THEY ARE SO TOUGH. 

1625
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,154
WHEN YOU HAVE THESE MS-13 THUGS 

1626
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,388
COME IN, I.C.E. 

1627
01:00:59,388 --> 01:01:01,791
COMES IN AND WIPES THEM OUT 

1628
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:03,025
LIKE NOTHING. 

1629
01:01:03,025 --> 01:01:07,096
THEY ARE MUCH TOUGHER. 

1630
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:08,364
THEY WIPE THEM OUT. 

1631
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,366
DELIBERATE TOWNS ON LONG ISLAND 

1632
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:12,602
AND OTHER PLACES. 

1633
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:16,005
IT IS LIKE A NATION IS 

1634
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,874
OCCUPYING YOUR COUNTRY. 

1635
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:19,675
WE ARE TAKING THEM OUT BY THE 

1636
01:01:19,675 --> 01:01:19,976
ú 

1637
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:22,745
IF IT WEREN'T FOR I.C.E.

1638
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:24,180
, WE WOULD NOT BE DOING IT. 

1639
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,182
THESE ARE SAVAGE GANGS. 

1640
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:30,620
WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THESE 

1641
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,088
VILE DEMOCRATS FEARS AGAINST 

1642
01:01:33,088 --> 01:01:34,323

1643
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:36,559

THAT INCLUDES OUR GREAT BORDER

THAT INCLUDES OUR MILITARY WITH 

1647
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:45,101
THEY ARE -- MILITARY WHERE THEY 

1648
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:46,368
ARE ALWAYS FIGHTING AGAINST 

1649
01:01:46,368 --> 01:01:52,809
FUNDING. 

1650
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:56,813
WE WILL ALWAYS STAND BY PROUDLY 

1651
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,481
THE HEROES. 

1652
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,883
THERE ARE HEROES ON LAW 

1653
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:03,686
ENFORCEMENT AND IN OUR MILITARY.

1654
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:10,493
EVERY DAY I AM PRESIDENT, WE 

1655
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:11,494

1659
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:17,200
WE WILL GET THEM AND THROW THEM 

1660
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,401
THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. 

1661
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:29,312
WE WILL PUT THEM IN JAIL. 

1662
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:33,015
THIS YEAR, IN NOVEMBER, IF YOU 

1663
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:35,685

NEXT YEAR WILL BE BIGGER. 

1670
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,465
WE SAVED OUR MILITARY. 

1671
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:51,500
GETTING MILITARY FUNDING FROM 

1672
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,903
THESE DEMOCRATS IS ALMOST 

1673
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:57,006
IMPOSSIBLE. 

1674
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:57,907
THEY DON'T WANT IT. 

1675
01:02:57,907 --> 01:02:59,242
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT OUR 

1676
01:02:59,242 --> 01:02:59,509
MILITARY. 

1677
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:00,877
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT OUR LAW 

1678
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:01,210
ENFORCEMENT. 

1679
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,478
THEY COULD NOT GIVE A DAMN. 

1680
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:03,913
YOU BETTER VOTE REPUBLICAN. 

1681
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:10,820
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICANS. 

1682
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,488
IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT YOUR 

1683
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:16,893
FAMILY AND YOUR COMMUNITY, THEN 

1684
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:19,528
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE. 

1685
01:03:19,528 --> 01:03:20,763
YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR 

1686
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:21,096
REPUBLICANS. 

1687
01:03:21,096 --> 01:03:23,399
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A COUNTRY, 

1688
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:26,269
IF YOU WANT BORDERS. 

1689
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:27,470
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE TO HAVE 

1690
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,204
BORDERS? 

1691
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:34,977
HOW ABOUT BORDERS? 

1692
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,612
>> BUILD THAT WALL! 

1693
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:41,083
BUILD THAT WALL! 

1694
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:43,719
BUILD THAT WALL! 

1695
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:45,755
BUILD THAT WALL! 

1696
01:03:45,755 --> 01:03:48,791
BUILD THAT WALL! 

1697
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:50,025
>> YES, WE ARE ALREADY BUILDING 

1698
01:03:50,025 --> 01:03:50,426
THE WALL. 

1699
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:53,128
IT STARTED IN SAN DIEGO, 

1700
01:03:53,128 --> 01:03:54,463
CALIFORNIA. 

1701
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:57,533
WE ARE ASKING FOR $5 BILLION. I 

1702
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:59,502
WILL TELL YOU WHAT, IT IS 

1703
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:03,605
BRUTAL WITH THESE PEOPLE. 

1704
01:04:03,605 --> 01:04:04,440
THEY DON'T WANT IT. 

1705
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,841
THEY KNOW IT IS THE RIGHT THING 

1706
01:04:05,841 --> 01:04:07,476
TO DO BUT THEY THINK IT WILL 

1707
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:07,877
HELP ME. 

1708
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:10,713
IT IS NOT EVEN THE REPUBLICANS. 

1709
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:12,348
IF WE DO IT, IT IS GOOD FOR 

1710
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:12,581
TRUMP. 

1711
01:04:12,581 --> 01:04:14,583
LET'S NOT DO IT. 

1712
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:16,719
EVERY DAY WE ARE KEEPING OUR 

1713
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:18,387
PROMISES. WE HAVE CREATED 3.4 

1714
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:20,055
MILLION JOBS SINCE ELECTION DAY 

1715
01:04:20,055 --> 01:04:24,126
WHICH NOBODY CAN EVEN BELIEVE. 

1716
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:26,162
NOBODY CAN BELIEVE IT. 

1717
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:29,832
NOBODY BELIEVES IT. 

1718
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:31,233
I ALWAYS SAY IF I WOULD HAVE 

1719
01:04:31,233 --> 01:04:32,268
SAID THAT ON THE CAMPAIGN 

1720
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:33,703
TRAIL, WHEN I WAS HERE OR 

1721
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,204
ANYPLACE ELSE, IT WOULD HAVE 

1722
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,975
BEEN BRUTAL. 

1723
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:40,176
THEY WOULD HAVE SAID HOW CAN 

1724
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:41,177
YOU POSSIBLY SAY ANYTHING LIKE 

1725
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:41,410
THAT? 

1726
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:42,611
3.4 MILLION NEW JOBS, 

1727
01:04:42,611 --> 01:04:44,413
UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS ARE AT A 45 

1728
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:51,354
YEAR LOW. 

1729
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:52,722
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC 

1730
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:53,990
AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE 

1731
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:57,259
REACHED THE LOWEST LEVELS IN 

1732
01:04:57,259 --> 01:05:02,531
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 

1733
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:04,166
REMEMBER, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO 

1734
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:08,004
LOSE? 

1735
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:09,405
PEOPLE DID NOT LIKE IT WHEN I 

1736
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:09,805
SAID THAT. 

1737
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:11,474
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? 

1738
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:12,074
WE ARE RIGHT. 

1739
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,909
A NEW POLL CAME OUT LAST WEEK. 

1740
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:15,511
WE WERE UP IN A WEEK, 10 POINTS 

1741
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:19,982
WITH THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY. 

1742
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:23,252
THEY WANT TO BE SAFE. 

1743
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,488
UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG WOMEN IS AT 

1744
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:27,723
THE LOWEST LEVEL IT HAS BEEN IN 

1745
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:30,359
THE 65 YEARS AND WITHIN A 

1746
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:33,162
COUPLE OF WEEKS HISTORY. 

1747
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:35,831
OUR ECONOMIC POLICY CAN BE 

1748
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:38,901
SUMMED UP IN THREE VERY SIMPLE 

1749
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:41,237
BUT BEAUTIFUL WORDS, JOBS, 

1750
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:46,008
JOBS, JOBS. 

1751
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:48,477
SINCE THE ELECTION, WE HAVE 

1752
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:52,048
LIFTED 3 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF 

1753
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:55,151
FOOD STAMPS. 

1754
01:05:55,151 --> 01:06:00,656
BY THE WAY, ON A HUMANITARIAN 

1755
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:04,693
BASIS, THAT IS A GREAT THING. 

1756
01:06:04,693 --> 01:06:06,095
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WE 

1757
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:07,329
SAVED BY DOING THAT AS A 

1758
01:06:07,329 --> 01:06:07,596
COUNTRY? 

1759
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:08,731
3 MILLION PEOPLE AND IT IS 

1760
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:09,365
GOING UP FAST. 

1761
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:11,200
WAGES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 18 

1762
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,401
YEARS ARE RISING AGAIN. 

1763
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:15,204
PEOPLE CAN GO OUT. 

1764
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:16,906
THEY CAN ACTUALLY CHOOSE A JOB 

1765
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:18,707
AND THEY HAVE WAGES THAT ARE 

1766
01:06:18,707 --> 01:06:19,909
RISING. 

1767
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:20,942
SIX MONTHS AGO, REPUBLICANS 

1768
01:06:20,942 --> 01:06:24,146
PASSED THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS IN 

1769
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,215
AMERICAN HISTORY, THE BIGGEST 

1770
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:29,251
IN AMERICAN HISTORY. EVERYBODY 

1771
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:31,053
IN THIS ROOM IS BETTER. 

1772
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:34,890
EVERYBODY IS BETTER FOR IT. 

1773
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:37,459
WE SLASHED TAXES FOR WORKING 

1774
01:06:37,459 --> 01:06:40,128
FAMILIES AND SAVED OUR FAMILY 

1775
01:06:40,128 --> 01:06:41,030
FARMS. 

1776
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:43,466
WE SAVED FAMILY FARMS. 

1777
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:46,735
AS A RESULT OF OUR TAX CUTS, 

1778
01:06:46,735 --> 01:06:49,138
$300 BILLION POURED BACK INTO 

1779
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:51,340
THE UNITED STATES JUST IN THE 

1780
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:55,878
FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR ALONE

1781
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:57,513
. WE HAVE A LOT MORE THAN THAT, 

1782
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,983
$300 BILLION CAME BACK. 

1783
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:02,151
THAT IS MONEY THAT WOULD HAVE 

1784
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:03,385
NEVER BEEN ABLE TO COME BACK 

1785
01:07:03,385 --> 01:07:12,528
INTO OUR COUNTRY. 

1786
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:13,529
APPLE COMPUTER IS SPENDING $350 

1787
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:16,398
BILLION ON NEW CAMPUSES ON NEW 

1788
01:07:16,398 --> 01:07:16,698
FACILITIES. 

1789
01:07:16,698 --> 01:07:20,035
THEY ARE BRINGING BACK $350 

1790
01:07:20,035 --> 01:07:20,302
BILLION. 

1791
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:21,437
THEY ARE PUTTING UP THEIR OWN 

1792
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:21,670
MONEY. 

1793
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:27,543
THEY WILL HAVE -- THEY WILL BE 

1794
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:28,777
SUBJECT TO THE TAX CODE, $230 

1795
01:07:28,777 --> 01:07:29,378
BILLION COME BACK. 

1796
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:33,249
95% OF U.S. MANUFACTURERS ARE 

1797
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:34,884
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE. 

1798
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,620
THAT IS THE HIGHEST NUMBER EVER.

1799
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,855
THINK ABOUT IT, 95% OF ANYTHING.

1800
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:42,591
YOU DON'T HEAR THAT. 

1801
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:46,662
WE ALSO REPEALED, DESPITE THE 

1802
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:50,332
THUMBS DOWN AT 2 AM, WE ALSO 

1803
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:53,268
REPEALED THE MOST HORRIBLE 

1804
01:07:53,268 --> 01:07:56,739
ASPECT OF THE FAILED OBAMACARE 

1805
01:07:56,739 --> 01:08:00,276
HEALTHCARE. IT IS CALLED THE 

1806
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:00,743
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. 

1807
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,511
IT IS GONE. 

1808
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:03,979
IT IS GONE. 

1809
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:07,783
GONE. 

1810
01:08:07,783 --> 01:08:11,020
IT IS GONE. 

1811
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:15,090
THAT WAS WHERE YOU HAD TO PAY A 

1812
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:16,291
LOT OF MONEY FOR THE PRIVILEGE 

1813
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:18,126
OF NOT HAVING TO PAY FOR BAD 

1814
01:08:18,126 --> 01:08:19,361
HEALTHCARE. 

1815
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:23,631
ONE OF THE TRULY RIPOFFS. 

1816
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:24,832
WE GOT RID OF IT. 

1817
01:08:24,832 --> 01:08:28,069
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU PAYING 

1818
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:31,273
NOT TO HAVE IT? 

1819
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:33,975

1821
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:36,212
THAT DOES NOT WORK. 

1822
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:38,080
WE ARE ALLOWING BUSINESSES TO

1828
01:08:46,988 --> 01:08:49,625
THEY CROSSED STATE LINES. 

1829
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,026
THEY WERE ALLOWED TO CROSS 

1830
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:51,460
STATE LINES. 

1831
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,496

HAVE BEEN RIPPING US OFF FOR

YEARS. 

1884
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:04,293
FOR TOO LONG, WE WATCHED AND WE 

1885
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:07,730
WAITED AND WE SAW AS OTHER 

1886
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:09,164
COUNTRIES STOLE OUR JOBS, 

1887
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:11,767
CHEATED OUR WORKERS AND GUTTED

OUR INDUSTRY. 

1889
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:16,438
LOOK AT ALL THE PLACES HERE AND 

1890
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,307

1891
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:20,342
IF YOU LOOK AT SOME PLACES AND 

1892
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:22,378
YOU GO UP TO NEW ENGLAND, YOU 

1893
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:23,378
CAN STILL SEE THE REMNANTS 

1894
01:11:23,378 --> 01:11:31,086
WHERE THEY MOVED DOWN TO MEXICO 

1895
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:31,419
UNDER NAFTA. 

1896
01:11:31,419 --> 01:11:32,721
IT IS ONE OF THE WORST DEALS. 

1897
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:33,388
WE ARE NEGOTIATING. 

1898
01:11:33,388 --> 01:11:34,757
I HAVE A FEELING THEY WILL COME 

1899
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:34,990
ALONG. 

1900
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:36,591
IF THEY DON'T, WE WILL DO 

1901
01:11:36,591 --> 01:11:38,193
BETTER. 

1902
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:39,828
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 

1903
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:42,631
WAS THE PIGGY BANK THAT 

1904
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:46,535
EVERYBODY WAS ROBBING. 

1905
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:47,769
OUR ALLIES IN MANY CASES WERE 

1906
01:11:47,769 --> 01:11:48,937
WORSE THAN OUR ENEMIES. 

1907
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:50,739
WE OPENED OUR COUNTRY TO THEIR 

1908
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:53,442
GOODS BUT THEY PUT UP MASSIVE 

1909
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:55,477
BARRIERS TO KEEP OUR PRODUCTS 

1910
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:59,548
AND OUR GOODS THE HELL OUT OF 

1911
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:00,549
OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY DID 

1912
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:03,952
NOT WANT THAT INVITATION. 

1913
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:04,620
-- COMPETITION. 

1914
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:09,491
THAT IS NOT FREE-TRADE, THAT IS 

1915
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:09,891
STUPID TRADE. 

1916
01:12:09,891 --> 01:12:13,962
WE DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE. 

1917
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:15,597
WE HAVE TO HAVE FAIR AND 

1918
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:20,402
RECIPROCAL. WE NEED RECIPROCAL. 

1919
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:23,472
THEY CHARGE A 50% TAX, WE 

1920
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:27,009
CHARGE A 50% TAX. 

1921
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,377
THEN WE SAY LET'S BRING IT TO 

1922
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:32,448
NOTHING OR I DON'T CARE. 

1923
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:34,016
IT IS INCREDIBLE. 

1924
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:37,686
WE HAVE COUNTRIES RIPPING US UP 

1925
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:42,191
FOR YEARS. 

1926
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,625
THEY SAY WE ARE GOING TO PUT 

1927
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:44,626
TARIFFS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN 

1928
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:45,027
RIPPING US. 

1929
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:45,861
WE HAVE TRADE DEFICITS, 

1930
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:46,161
SURPLUSES. 

1931
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:50,532
THEY HAVE ALL OF THIS. 

1932
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:51,967
THEY SAY WE ARE GOING TO DO 

1933
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:55,170
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. 

1934
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,604
SOME POLITICIANS SAY IT IS 

1935
01:12:56,604 --> 01:12:57,038
TERRIBLE. 

1936
01:12:57,038 --> 01:12:59,608
>> I SAY WE ARE GOING TO MAKE 

1937
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:04,546
GREAT DEALS. 

1938
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:05,981
THEY WANT ME TO LEAVE IT THE 

1939
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:07,382
WAY IT IS BUT I SAY NO. 

1940
01:13:07,382 --> 01:13:08,383
WE HAVE ALL THE CARDS. 

1941
01:13:08,383 --> 01:13:09,618
WE ARE THE BANK THAT EVERYONE 

1942
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:11,253
IS STEALING FROM. 

1943
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:12,954
YOU SAW WITH CHINA, $50 BILLION 

1944
01:13:12,954 --> 01:13:15,723
AND ANOTHER $200 BILLION IS 

1945
01:13:15,723 --> 01:13:17,960
WAITING. 

1946
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,528
NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN THIS 

1947
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:22,164
BEFORE. 

1948
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:26,167
CHINA -- YOU HAVE TO RESPECT 

1949
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:28,470
THEM AND ADMIRE THEM. 

1950
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,072
THEY WILL SAY DONALD TRUMP 

1951
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,207
LOVES CHINA. HE LOVES CHINA 

1952
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:33,408
MORE THAN HE LOVES THE UNITED 

1953
01:13:33,408 --> 01:13:34,142
STATES. 

1954
01:13:34,142 --> 01:13:35,444
THESE PEOPLE. 

1955
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:37,079
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU 

1956
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:37,279
SAY. 

1957
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,717
IF I SAY THAT, -- I DO. 

1958
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:42,951
I RESPECT CHINA. 

1959
01:13:42,951 --> 01:13:47,055
THEY HAVE BEEN KILLING US, $507 

1960
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:50,926
BILLION IN TRADE DEFICITS LAST 

1961
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,829
YEAR. 

1962
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:59,201
WHO THE HELL CAN LOSE THAT 

1963
01:13:59,201 --> 01:13:59,401
MUCH? 

1964
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:00,635
THEN YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING 

1965
01:14:00,635 --> 01:14:01,837
ABOUT IT AND YOU GET ATTACKED. 

1966
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:02,638
THAT IS NOT NICE. 

1967
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:04,105
THAT IS NOT FREE-TRADE. 

1968
01:14:04,105 --> 01:14:06,074
THE WAR WAS LOST ON TRADE MANY 

1969
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:09,177
YEARS AGO. 

1970
01:14:09,177 --> 01:14:10,612
THE WAR WAS LOST BUT NOW WE 

1971
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:11,213
WILL WIN IT. 

1972
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:18,720
WE HAVE ALL THE CARS -- CARDS. 

1973
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,356
>> IT IS ALWAYS HELPFUL IF YOU 

1974
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:24,826
DON'T HAVE THE LITTLE ONES 

1975
01:14:24,826 --> 01:14:25,661
GAPING AT YOUR HEELS. 

1976
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:26,862
IT IS EASY TO NEGOTIATE WHEN 

1977
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:30,732
YOU HAVE SUPPORT. YOU DON'T 

1978
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:31,733
HAVE SOME SENATOR THAT WAS 

1979
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:32,968
FORCED OUT OF OFFICE BECAUSE HE 

1980
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,169
DID NOT LIKE ME SAYING BAD 

1981
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:35,337
THINGS LIKE WE SHOULD NOT BE 

1982
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:35,771
DOING THAT. 

1983
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:37,573
WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING THAT 

1984
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:38,440
AGAINST SO-AND-SO. 

1985
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,576
WE ARE IN SUCH A GREAT POSITION.

1986
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:44,346
OTHER COUNTRIES ARE CALLING US. 

1987
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:45,547
DID YOU KNOW THAT IF WE 

1988
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:47,983
KNOCKDOWN THE TRADE DEFICIT BY 

1989
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:54,322
JUST A LITTLE BIT, 25%, WE PICK 

1990
01:14:54,322 --> 01:14:57,559
UP ONE POINT IN GDP. 

1991
01:14:57,559 --> 01:14:59,361
DOES ANYBODY KNOW THAT? 

1992
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:01,797
THAT IS $3 TRILLION AND THAT IS 

1993
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:03,398
10 MILLION JOBS. 

1994
01:15:03,398 --> 01:15:06,268
THAT IS JUST 25%. 

1995
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:07,302
WE PICK UP ONE POINT. 

1996
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:11,006
SPEAKING OF GDP, REMEMBER WHEN 

1997
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,541
I WOULD SAY IT WAS GOING TO GO 

1998
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:13,375
TO 3% PRETTY QUICKLY? 

1999
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,544
NOW, THE ATLANTA FEDS JUST 

2000
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:25,153
PREDICTED 4.8%. WHO KNOWS? I 

2001
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:26,588
CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT IT WILL 

2002
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:28,557
BE A LOT BETTER THAN YOU HAD 

2003
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:29,424
WITH OBAMA. 

2004
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:30,459
IF THESE PEOPLE GET ELECTED, 

2005
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:32,227
YOU WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN LIKE 

2006
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:34,896
YOU NEVER SAW ANYTHING GO DOWN. 

2007
01:15:34,896 --> 01:15:36,531
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN THE 

2008
01:15:36,531 --> 01:15:36,931
REGULATIONS OFF. 

2009
01:15:36,931 --> 01:15:38,166
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN THE 

2010
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:38,567
TAX CUTS. 

2011
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:41,203
YOU WOULD HAVE HAD AN ECONOMY 

2012
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,371
THAT WAS GOING TO CRASH AND 

2013
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:42,604
BURN. 

2014
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:48,710
IT WAS READY. 

2015
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:50,145
NOW WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS A 

2016
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:50,445
ROCKETSHIP. 

2017
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:51,747
EVERY TIME I MEET A LEADER OF 

2018
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:52,581
ANOTHER COUNTRY, WHICH IS 

2019
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:53,582
OFTEN, THEY ALWAYS START BY 

2020
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:54,616
SAYING "I WOULD LIKE TO 

2021
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:55,417
CONGRATULATE YOU ON THE 

2022
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:56,418
INCREDIBLE JOB YOU HAVE DONE 

2023
01:15:56,418 --> 01:16:00,422
WITH THE UNITED STATES." 

2024
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:03,925
JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, EVERY TIME, 

2025
01:16:03,925 --> 01:16:08,430
THEY WANT TO CONGRATULATE ME. 

2026
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:09,998
OTHERS ARE STUDYING WHAT WE 

2027
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:11,266
HAVE DONE. 

2028
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:12,934
THEY ARE STUDYING WHAT WE HAVE 

2029
01:16:12,934 --> 01:16:13,902
DONE. 

2030
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,303
WE HAVE THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN 

2031
01:16:15,303 --> 01:16:15,704
THE WORLD. 

2032
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:17,973
THOSE BEAUTIFUL HATS MAKE 

2033
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:24,279
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 

2034
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:28,050
SOON TO BE CHANGED TO "KEEP 

2035
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:31,452
AMERICA GREAT." KEEP AMERICA 

2036
01:16:31,452 --> 01:16:32,587
GREAT! 

2037
01:16:32,587 --> 01:16:36,024
SOON TO BE CHANGED. 

2038
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:37,259
I CAN'T USE MAKE AMERICA GREAT 

2039
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:40,095
AGAIN FOR THE SECOND RUN. 

2040
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:41,530
THEY SAID WHY THE HELL DID YOU 

2041
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:42,531
DO IT THE FIRST TIME? 

2042
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:45,400
IT IS CALLED KEEP AMERICA 

2043
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:45,633
GREAT. 

2044
01:16:45,633 --> 01:16:46,601
WHAT WE ARE DOING IS 

2045
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:46,901
INCREDIBLE. 

2046
01:16:46,901 --> 01:16:47,635
IT IS INCREDIBLE. 

2047
01:16:47,635 --> 01:16:52,074
WE HAVE CREATED -- SINCE THE 

2048
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:54,142
ELECTION, WE HAVE CREATED IN 

2049
01:16:54,142 --> 01:17:02,250
WEALTH $7 TRILLION. WITH THE 

2050
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:08,523
FASTEST GROWING NATION ON AN 

2051
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:09,558
ECONOMY BASIS, MAYBE IT DOES 

2052
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:10,926
FOR THE BIG NATIONS. 

2053
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:14,229
I HEARD THE NATION WITH THE 

2054
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:15,097
FASTEST GROWING ECONOMIC NATION 

2055
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:15,664
IN THE WORLD. 

2056
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:23,138
THINK OF THAT. 

2057
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:26,441
I ADD THE BIG NATION BECAUSE 

2058
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:29,244
THEY ARE PROBABLY BACK AT IT. 

2059
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:30,478
WE ARE ONE OF THE FASTEST. 

2060
01:17:30,478 --> 01:17:32,681
I THINK WE ARE THE FASTEST 

2061
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:34,149
GROWING AND WE ARE CERTAINLY 

2062
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:39,020
GROWING OUR MILITARY. 

2063
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:40,222
WE ARE TAKING CARE OF OUR 

2064
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:41,690
VETERANS MORE THAN ANYONE EVER 

2065
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:47,529
HAS. 

2066
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:50,332
THANKS TO REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP,

2067
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:55,070
AMERICANS WINNING AGAIN -- 

2068
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:59,975
AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN.

01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:00,542
AMERICA IS BEING RESPECTED 

2070
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:02,744
AGAIN ALL OVER THE WORLD. 

2071
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:05,013
SOMEBODY SAID COULD YOU TELL 

2072
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:06,648
THE WINNING STORY BACKSTAGE? I 

2073
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:10,686
SAID I HAVE HEARD IT BUT STEVE 

2074
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:11,319

2075
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:13,554
HE COMES UP TO ME AND I SAY HI 

2076
01:18:13,554 --> 01:18:16,191
STEVE. 

2077
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,825
HE SAID SIR, THE PEOPLE OF 

2078
01:18:17,825 --> 01:18:22,631
MONTANA ARE REALLY TIRED. 

2079
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:27,569
THEY CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. 

2080
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:28,937
THEY SAY WE HAVE TO SLOW IT 

2081
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:29,170
DOWN. 

2082
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:31,639
I SAY STEVE, GO BACK TO THE 

2083
01:18:31,639 --> 01:18:39,648
PEOPLE. 

2084
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:41,183
GO BACK TO THE PEOPLE AND SAY I 

2085
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:42,384
AM SORRY, I CANNOT HONOR THAT 

2086
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:42,651
REQUEST. 

2087
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:44,019
WE ARE GOING TO WIN AND WIN. 

2088
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:45,420
WE ARE GOING TO WIN MORE LIKE 

2089
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:52,294
WE HAVE NEVER WON BEFORE. 

2090
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:55,063
WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA 

2091
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:56,798
FIRST. 

2092
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:59,034
WE ARE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. 

2093
01:18:59,034 --> 01:19:07,175
BY THE WAY, WHAT DID IT MEAN 

2094
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:08,610
WHEN SOMEONE SAID THOUSAND 

2095
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:09,411
POINTS OF LIGHT? 

2096
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:14,683
I KNOW ONE THING, MAKE AMERICA 

2097
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:15,517
GREAT AGAIN, WE UNDERSTAND. 

2098
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:16,318
PUTTING AMERICA FIRST, WE 

2099
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:16,618
UNDERSTAND. 

2100
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:20,155
THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT, I 

2101
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:21,189
NEVER QUITE GOT THAT ONE. 

2102
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:22,190
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? 

2103
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,225
HAS ANYONE EVER FIGURED OUT 

2104
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:25,427
WHAT THAT IS? 

2105
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:30,932
WE ARE INDEED DOING THINGS FOR 

2106
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:31,733
THE COUNTRY LIKE NOBODY 

2107
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:32,166
BELIEVED POSSIBLE. 

2108
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:36,004
WE ARE REBUILDING OUR ECONOMY. 

2109
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:37,005
FOR THE SAME THING, WE ARE 

2110
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:39,474
RESTORING OUR SECURITY. 

2111
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:40,475
WE HAVE PEOPLE FLOODING OUR 

2112
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:41,509
BORDERS LIKE THEY HAVE NOT 

2113
01:19:41,509 --> 01:19:44,746
FLOODED EVER BEFORE. 

2114
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:46,314
THEY ARE DOING AN INCREDIBLE 

2115
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:46,781
JOB. 

2116
01:19:46,781 --> 01:19:48,382
PEOPLE WANT A PIECE OF OUR 

2117
01:19:48,382 --> 01:19:49,017
ACTION. 

2118
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:50,651
THEY WANT TO COME INTO OUR 

2119
01:19:50,651 --> 01:19:54,089
ECONOMY. 

2120
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:54,890
THEY WANT TO COME IN. 

2121
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:56,124
THE PROBLEM IS, YOU HAVE TO 

2122
01:19:56,124 --> 01:20:04,666
COME IN LEGALLY. 

2123
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:05,867
ALL OF THAT MONEY THAT WE HAVE 

2124
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:07,836
SECURED FOR OUR MILITARY, ALL 

2125
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:10,738
OF THAT, I HAVE DIRECTED TO 

2126
01:20:10,738 --> 01:20:15,009
PENTAGON TO BEGIN A PROCESS OF 

2127
01:20:15,009 --> 01:20:18,480
CREATING A SIX THE BRANCH OF 

2128
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,481
THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES 

2129
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:22,951
CALLED THE SPACE FORCE. YOU 

2130
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:25,787
HAVE THE AIR FORCE, YOU WILL 

2131
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:29,824
HAVE THE SPACE FORCE. 

2132
01:20:29,824 --> 01:20:33,895
PEOPLE ARE SO EXCITED BY THAT. 

2133
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:35,130
IT IS NOT JUST SENDING ROCKETS 

2134
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:39,167
TO THE MOON. 

2135
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:40,201
THIS IS ALSO A MILITARY 

2136
01:20:40,201 --> 01:20:40,501
IMPERATIVE. 

2137
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:42,003
IN FACT, IN RUSSIA, THEY SAID 

2138
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:42,804
THEY CONSIDER IT VERY 

2139
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:44,039
THREATENING AND OTHERS DID TOO. 

2140
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:47,509
I AM SORRY. 

2141
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,144
IF IT IS A PART OF THE AIR 

2142
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:50,345
FORCE, THE AIR FORCE WILL FOCUS 

2143
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:52,380
ON THE AIR FORCE BUT WE NEED A 

2144
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:52,780
SEPARATE BRANCH. 

2145
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:53,815
WE ARE WORKING ON THAT. 

2146
01:20:53,815 --> 01:21:00,722
IT IS CALLED THE SPACE FORCE. 

2147
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:01,623
IT IS VERY EXCITING. 

2148
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:02,123
PEOPLE LOVE IT. 

2149
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:03,358
THEY GET TO ATTEND THEY LOVE 

2150
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:04,125
IT. 

2151
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:09,064
WE PASSED A LANDMARK VA 

2152
01:21:09,064 --> 01:21:09,664
ACCOUNTABILITY LAW THAT 

2153
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:12,200
EVERYBODY SAID COULD NOT BE 

2154
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:12,701
PASSED. 

2155
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,102
I WON'T BLAME THE UNIONS AND I 

2156
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:17,772
WON'T BLAME CIVIL SERVICE BUT 

2157
01:21:17,772 --> 01:21:19,007
LET'S ASSUME THEY HAD A LITTLE 

2158
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:19,240
BLAME. 

2159
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,408
EVERYONE SAID IT COULD NOT BE 

2160
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:20,641
PASSED. 

2161
01:21:20,641 --> 01:21:25,914
WE JUST GOT IT PAST. 

2162
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:26,581
THE VA ACCOUNTABILITY. 

2163
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:27,716
NOW, YOU CAN FIRE PEOPLE WHEN 

2164
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:35,790
THEY DON'T DO A JOB. 

2165
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:38,893
YOUR FIRED! 

2166
01:21:38,893 --> 01:21:40,128
YOU GET THEM THE HELL OUT. 

2167
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:41,529
THEY ARE NOT TAKING CARE OF OUR 

2168
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:42,564
VETS, WE WILL FIRE THEM. 

2169
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,366
THEY ARE OUT OF THEIR! 

2170
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:49,237
-- THEIR EXPERT -- THERE X -- 

2171
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:53,308
THEY ARE OUT OF THERE! 

2172
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:54,743
THE OTHER THING WE PASSED A FEW 

2173
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:55,977
WEEKS AGO, AND YOU HAVE HEARD 

2174
01:21:55,977 --> 01:22:01,849
ME TALK ABOUT THIS, OUR úVETERA 

2175
01:22:01,849 --> 01:22:02,082
PEOPLE. 

2176
01:22:02,082 --> 01:22:02,884
THEY HAVE PROTECTED US. 

2177
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:03,885
SOME OF THEM HAVE SUFFERED 

2178
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:04,152
GREATLY. 

2179
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:05,954
WE WERE NOT TAKING PROPER CARE 

2180
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:06,221
OF THEM. 

2181
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:07,889
THEY WERE WAITING IN LINE FOR 

2182
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:08,389
12 DAYS. 

2183
01:22:08,389 --> 01:22:10,759
ANYBODY IN THIS AUDIENCE, GO TO 

2184
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:14,662
THE DOCTOR. IF THEY TELL YOU 

2185
01:22:14,662 --> 01:22:17,899
THEY CANNOT SEE YOU FOR 12 DAYS

2186
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:18,700
, THAT ONE FLY. 

2187
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:19,734
PEOPLE WERE GOING IN WITH 

2188
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:21,169
NOTHING MUCH AND THEY WERE 

2189
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:22,636
COMING OUT WITH A TERMINAL 

2190
01:22:22,636 --> 01:22:24,372
ILLNESS. 

2191
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:25,940
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CORRECTED 

2192
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:27,842
EASILY. 

2193
01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:29,077
I SAID WHY AREN'T WE JUST 

2194
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:31,813
SENDING PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO WAIT

2195
01:22:31,813 --> 01:22:32,914
TO THESE LONG PERIODS, SEND 

2196
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:34,549
THEM ACROSS THE STREET TO A 

2197
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:34,949
LOCAL DOCTOR. 

2198
01:22:34,949 --> 01:22:39,154
WE WILL PAY THE BILL. 

2199
01:22:39,154 --> 01:22:43,391
EVERYBODY SAID WE HAVE BEEN 

2200
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:44,292
TRYING TO GET THAT PASSED FOR 

2201
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:44,726
40 YEARS. 

2202
01:22:44,726 --> 01:22:49,998
I GOT IT PAST THREE WEEKS AGO. 

2203
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:51,699
I AM GOOD AT GETTING THINGS 

2204
01:22:51,699 --> 01:22:56,671
PASSED. 

2205
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:57,672
REMEMBER, WE HAD REPEAL AND 

2206
01:22:57,672 --> 01:22:59,507
REPLACE PAST EXCEPT FOR ONE 

2207
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:03,511
PERSON AND ALL OF THE DEMOCRATS.

2208
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:04,813
ONE PERSON PLUS ALL OF THE 

2209
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:05,580
DEMOCRATS. 

2210
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:08,883
WE HAD NO DEMOCRATS. 

2211
01:23:08,883 --> 01:23:10,885
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS A 

2212
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:11,519
GREAT MAN. 

2213
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:15,390
HE IS A GREAT MAN. 

2214
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:19,194
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT AMERICAN 

2215
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:22,497
FOREIGN AID DOLLARS SHOULD 

2216
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:23,731
PROMOTE AMERICA'S INTEREST AND 

2217
01:23:23,731 --> 01:23:28,203
VALUES. 

2218
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:29,571
WE DON'T NEED TO SEND YOUR HARD 

2219
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:30,572
EARNED MONEY TO COUNTRIES THAT 

2220
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:31,639
VOTE AGAINST THE UNITED STATES 

2221
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:32,440
CONSISTENTLY IN THE UNITED 

2222
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:33,274
NATIONS AND OTHER PLACES. 

2223
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:36,711
WE DON'T NEED TO DO IT. 

2224
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:41,182
REMEMBER WITH ISRAEL? REMEMBER 

2225
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:42,817
WHEN WE HAD TWO VOTES ON 

2226
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:43,618
SOMETHING HASN'T -- SOMETHING 

2227
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:45,253
HAVING TO DO WITH ISRAEL. 

2228
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:49,491
WE GIVE ALL OF THE AID TO THESE 

2229
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:50,525
COUNTRIES AND WE ARE WATCHING. 

2230
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:51,726
WE ENDED UP GETTING 68 VOTES. 

2231
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:57,632
WE DID NOT DO ANYTHING. 

2232
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:58,433
THEY ARE RIPPING US. 

2233
01:23:58,433 --> 01:23:59,467
THEY ARE TAKING OUR MONEY. 

2234
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:00,668
THEY DON'T EVEN VOTE FOR US 

2235
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:01,703
BECAUSE THEY DID NOT RESPECT 

2236
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:05,340
OUR COUNTRY BUT NOW THEY ARE 

2237
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:06,174
RESPECTING A LOT MORE. 

2238
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:07,375
IN MANY CASES, THEY ARE NOT 

2239
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:08,209
GETTING THAT MONEY ANYMORE. 

2240
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:09,010
WE HAVE STOPPED IT. 

2241
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:11,179
INSTEAD OF APOLOGIZING, WE ARE 

2242
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:13,481
STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND WE 

2243
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:16,684
ARE STANDING UP FOR OUR GREAT 

2244
01:24:16,684 --> 01:24:31,365
AMERICAN FLAG. HOW ABOUT THE 

2245
01:24:31,365 --> 01:24:32,367
NFL? 

2246
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:33,835
I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE 

2247
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:38,473
CONTROVERSY. 

2248
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:39,474
I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE 

2249
01:24:39,474 --> 01:24:41,042
CONTROVERSY BUT THEY PAST THIS 

2250
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:43,745
STUPID THING. 

2251
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:44,946
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS 

2252
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:45,213
ANYMORE. 

2253
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:46,381
IF YOU DON'T RESPECT THE FLAG 

2254
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:47,615
OR IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE 

2255
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:48,850
COUNTRY OR WHATEVER IT IS, JUST 

2256
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:50,051
GO INTO THE LOCKER ROOM. 

2257
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:51,819
I THINK IN MANY RESPECTS, THAT 

2258
01:24:51,819 --> 01:24:54,856
IS WORSE. ISN'T THAT WORSE THAN 

2259
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:55,924
NOT STANDING? 

2260
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:58,159
I THINK THAT IS WORSE. 

2261
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:02,897
THEY SAY GO INTO THE LOCKER 

2262
01:25:02,897 --> 01:25:04,866
ROOM. 

2263
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:05,466
IT IS OKAY. 

2264
01:25:05,466 --> 01:25:06,701
THE ANTHEM IS GETTING READY TO 

2265
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:07,902
PLAY, THEY RUN INTO THE LOCKER 

2266
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:09,103
ROOM AND THEN THEY COME BACK 

2267
01:25:09,103 --> 01:25:09,303
OUT. 

2268
01:25:09,303 --> 01:25:12,774
THAT DOES NOT PLAY. 

2269
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,776
I ACTUALLY THINK IN MANY WAYS, 

2270
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:15,843
IT IS WORSE. 

2271
01:25:15,843 --> 01:25:17,045
I HEARD THIS THING THAT THE 

2272
01:25:17,045 --> 01:25:19,681
OWNERS WERE SO HAPPY. 

2273
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:20,515
WHERE THIS COMMISSIONER COMES 

2274
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:21,516
FROM, I HAVE NO IDEA. 

2275
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:22,750
THEY ARE PAYING HIM $40 MILLION 

2276
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:25,019
A YEAR AND THE RATINGS ARE DOWN 

2277
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:25,787
20%. 

2278
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,421
YOU KNOW WHY THEIR RATINGS ARE 

2279
01:25:27,421 --> 01:25:29,457
DOWN? 

2280
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:30,858
YES, THE FLAG BUT THEY ARE ALSO 

2281
01:25:30,858 --> 01:25:32,160
DOWN BECAUSE PEOPLE FIND 

2282
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:39,734
POLITICS TO BE MUCH TOUGHER AND 

2283
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:41,235
MORE INTERESTING THAN WATCHING 

2284
01:25:41,235 --> 01:25:43,638
A FOOTBALL GAME. 

2285
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:45,073
THEY ARE WATCHING THE CABLE 

2286
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:46,808
NETWORKS INSTEAD OF WATCHING 

2287
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:47,308
FOOTBALL. 

2288
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:48,943
THEY ARE DOWN 20% SINCE THIS 

2289
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:50,979
WHOLE THING STARTED WITH THE 

2290
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,347
FLAG IN THE ANTHEM. 

2291
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:54,448
WASHINGTON TRIED TO CHANGE US 

2292
01:25:54,448 --> 01:25:57,985
BUT INSTEAD, WE ARE CHANGING 

2293
01:25:57,985 --> 01:25:58,920
WASHINGTON. 

2294
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,757
WE HAVE HAD A BIG IMPACT. 

2295
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:07,595
NOW, WE NEED MATT ROSENDALE IN 

2296
01:26:07,595 --> 01:26:11,899
THE SENATE TO CONTINUE OUR FIGHT

2297
01:26:11,899 --> 01:26:15,570
, TO DRAIN THE SWAMP. WE ARE 

2298
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:17,939
GOING TO GET IT DONE. 

2299
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:19,440
WE NEED TO WORK EVERY DAY FROM 

2300
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:22,877
NOW UNTIL THE ELECTION FOR YOUR 

2301
01:26:22,877 --> 01:26:23,878
FAMILY, FOR YOUR COMMUNITY, FOR 

2302
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:25,146
YOUR COUNTRY, FOR YOUR 

2303
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:30,485
CONSTITUTION. 

2304
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:31,586
THIS NOVEMBER, I NEED YOU TO 

2305
01:26:31,586 --> 01:26:32,620
GET YOUR FRIENDS, GET YOUR 

2306
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:33,621
COLLEAGUES, GET YOUR NEIGHBORS 

2307
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:35,056
AND GET YOUR [ NULL ] OUT TO 

2308
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:35,456
VOTE.  

2309
01:26:35,456 --> 01:26:36,491
IS THAT OKAY? 

2310
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:42,764
GET YOUR [ NULL ] OUT TO VOTE.  

2311
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:46,234
VOTE FOR MATT. 

2312
01:26:46,234 --> 01:26:47,635
THEY ARE GOING TO SAY THAT WAS 

2313
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:48,636
NOT PRESIDENTIAL. 

2314
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:49,037
WATCH. 

2315
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,706
THAT WAS NOT PRESIDENTIAL. 

2316
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:53,341
DID I EVER TELL YOU HOW EASY IT 

2317
01:26:53,341 --> 01:26:54,575
WOULD BE FOR ME TO BE 

2318
01:26:54,575 --> 01:26:54,908
PRESIDENTIAL? 

2319
01:26:54,908 --> 01:26:57,412
LIKE WE ARE ALL REALLY SMART 

2320
01:26:57,412 --> 01:26:58,179
PEOPLE. 

2321
01:26:58,179 --> 01:27:01,883
I HAVE THE MOST LOYAL PEOPLE IN 

2322
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:02,250
THE WORLD. 

2323
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,118
THEY ARE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE. 

2324
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:06,321
THEY ARE THE TOUGHEST PEOPLE. 

2325
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:08,089
THEY ARE THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN 

2326
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:09,190
THE WORLD. 

2327
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:10,825
THEY WILL SAY SOMETHING LIKE 

2328
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:11,859
THAT IS NOT PRESIDENTIAL. 

2329
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:14,895
WHAT I SAY, ACTING PRESIDENTIAL 

2330
01:27:14,895 --> 01:27:16,898
IS SO EASY. 

2331
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:19,300
IT IS MUCH EASIER THAN WHAT I 

2332
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,768
DO. 

2333
01:27:20,768 --> 01:27:22,537
SOMETIMES, I HAVE TO DO THIS. 

2334
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:26,441
YOU WALK UP TO THE MICROPHONE, 

2335

2338
01:27:35,449 --> 01:27:38,619
EMPHASIS. 

2339

01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:54,395
MONTANA, WAS FORGED BY 

2363
01:28:54,395 --> 01:28:55,196
INCREDIBLE PIONEER MEN AND 

2364
01:28:55,196 --> 01:28:56,431
WOMEN WHO BRAVED THE COLD AND 

2365
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:57,665
TAMED THE WILDERNESS TO BUILD A 

2366
01:28:57,665 --> 01:28:58,666
BEAUTIFUL LIFE RIGHT OUT HERE 

2367
01:28:58,666 --> 01:28:59,267
IN THE OPEN. 

2368
01:28:59,267 --> 01:29:01,502
I DID LOOK AT THE SKY. 

2369
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:05,373
I HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOUR SKY. 

2370
01:29:05,373 --> 01:29:08,109
I HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOUR SKY. 

2371
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:10,043
I RODE IN AND I LOOKED AT THE 

2372
01:29:10,043 --> 01:29:12,280
SKY. 

2373
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:16,017
I AM NOT -- NOT SEEING POLLUTION

2374
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:19,320
IS A WONDERFUL THING. 

2375
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:23,858
THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL SKIES. 

2376
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:26,427
THESE MONTANA PIONEERS WERE 

2377
01:29:26,427 --> 01:29:28,930
TOUGH AND THEY WERE STRONG AND 

2378
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:32,166
THEY WERE BRILLIANT. 

2379
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:33,601
THEY DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF 

2380
01:29:33,601 --> 01:29:33,834
MONEY. 

2381
01:29:33,834 --> 01:29:35,636
THEY DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF 

2382
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:36,604
LUXURY BUT THEY HAD FAITH. 

2383
01:29:36,604 --> 01:29:37,238
THEY HAD HEART. 

2384
01:29:37,238 --> 01:29:37,839
THEY HAD GREAT. 

2385
01:29:37,839 --> 01:29:40,708
THEY HAD EACH OTHER. 

2386
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:43,711
ABOVE ALL ELSE, THEY LOVED 

2387
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:45,379
THEIR FAMILIES, THEY LOVED 

2388
01:29:45,379 --> 01:29:47,982
THEIR COUNTRY AND THEY LOVED 

2389
01:29:47,982 --> 01:29:53,921

SEVERAL JOBS AT SENATOR JON 

2440
01:32:17,732 --> 01:32:18,332
TESTER, THE DEMOCRAT. 

2441
01:32:18,332 --> 01:32:19,767
AT THE SAME TIME, HE DID NOT 

2442
01:32:19,767 --> 01:32:20,768
SAY MUCH ABOUT HIS REPUBLICAN 

2443
01:32:20,768 --> 01:32:23,170
OPPONENT, MATT ROSENDALE, WHOM 

2444
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:24,604
HE WAS THERE PRESUMABLY TO 

2445
01:32:24,604 --> 01:32:25,840
BOOST. 

2446
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,075
WHAT STOOD OUT TO YOU IN TERMS 

2447
01:32:28,075 --> 01:32:29,710
OF HOW THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO

01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:34,181
FRAME THIS MONTANA SENATE RACE? 

2449
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:35,582
>> Reporter: THAT WAS A 

2450
01:32:35,582 --> 01:32:40,054
COMPREHENSIVE RALLY. 

2451
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:41,288
THAT IS ALL I COULD SAY. 

2452
01:32:41,288 --> 01:32:42,723
HE TOUCHED ON A LOT OF POINTS. 

2453
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:49,430
HE DID GO AFTER JON TESTER. 

2454
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:50,631
IT FEELS LIKE IT WAS JUST 

2455
01:32:50,631 --> 01:32:51,432
YESTERDAY BUT SEVERAL WEEKS 

2456
01:32:51,432 --> 01:32:52,667
AGO, A FEW MONTHS AGO, THE 

2457
01:32:52,667 --> 01:32:53,267
PRESIDENT APPOINTED A 

2458
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:55,302

RONNIE JACKSON. 

2461
01:32:59,573 --> 01:33:00,574
JON TESTER IS THE TOP-RANKED 

2462
01:33:00,574 --> 01:33:04,145
DEMOCRAT ON THE SENATE COMMITTEE

2463
01:33:04,145 --> 01:33:05,479
WHICH ESSENTIALLY KILLED THE 

2464
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:07,682
NOMINATION BY LEAKING A LOT OF 

2465
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:13,788
STORIES ABOUT RONNIE JACKSON. 

2466
01:33:13,788 --> 01:33:16,624
THAT SHOWED HIM INVOLVED IN 

2467
01:33:16,624 --> 01:33:18,859
SOME SORT OF SCANDAL. 

2468
01:33:18,859 --> 01:33:23,964
THE PRESIDENT SAID AT THE TIME 

2469
01:33:23,964 --> 01:33:25,165
"I WILL GET YOU JON TESTER." 

2470
01:33:25,165 --> 01:33:26,233
TONIGHT, HE DID. 

2471
01:33:26,233 --> 01:33:29,036
BASICALLY HE TOOK ON JON 

2472
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:30,004
TESTER, TELLING THE CROWD THAT 

2473
01:33:30,004 --> 01:33:31,872
JON TESTER HAS SAID THE 

2474
01:33:31,872 --> 01:33:33,708
PRESIDENT IS A GREAT GUY BUT 

2475
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:39,980
VOTES AGAINST HIM EVERY TURN. 

2476
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:41,215
IT IS FUNNY BECAUSE AT ONE 

2477
01:33:41,215 --> 01:33:42,216
POINT, THE PRESIDENT SAID HE 

2478
01:33:42,216 --> 01:33:43,451
WOULD RATHER HAVE A GUY THAT 

2479
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,085
SAID BAD THINGS ABOUT ME BUT 

2480
01:33:45,085 --> 01:33:47,722
VOTED WITH ME 100% OF THE TIME. 

2481
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:48,723
INCIDENTALLY, HE DOES HAVE THAT 

2482
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:49,523
IN SENATOR JEFF FLAKE. 

2483
01:33:49,523 --> 01:33:50,558
HOWEVER, JEFF FLAKE IS NOT 

2484
01:33:50,558 --> 01:33:51,158
RUNNING FOR REELECTION. 

2485
01:33:51,158 --> 01:33:53,994
THAT SAID, THE PRESIDENT DID GO 

2486
01:33:53,994 --> 01:33:57,264
AFTER JON TESTER. TESTER WAS 

2487
01:33:57,264 --> 01:33:57,865
READY FOR THIS. 

2488
01:33:57,865 --> 01:34:00,001
TODAY, HE TOOK OUT 16 FULL-PAGE 

2489
01:34:00,001 --> 01:34:05,606

I AM GLAD YOU ARE HERE." 

2492
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:13,714
THANK YOU FOR SIGNING A NUMBER 

2493
01:34:13,714 --> 01:34:20,354
OF BILLS THAT I PUSHED. 

2494
01:34:20,354 --> 01:34:27,728
IT WAS AN INTERESTING, LIVELY, 

2495
01:34:27,728 --> 01:34:30,131
ALL-ENCOMPASSING RALLY IN 

2496
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:31,398

2497
01:34:31,398 --> 01:34:36,637
>> WE ALSO HEARD WHAT SEEMED TO 

2498
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:38,239
BE SOME NEW RHETORIC IN HIS 

2499
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:40,941
PERIODIC ATTACKS AGAINST 

2500
01:34:40,941 --> 01:34:41,541
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR ELIZABETH 

2501
01:34:41,541 --> 01:34:44,178
WARREN OF MASSACHUSETTS WHO IS 

2502
01:34:44,178 --> 01:34:44,778
RUNNING FOR REELECTION. 

2503
01:34:44,778 --> 01:34:47,648
TELL US WHAT HE OFFERED TO DO. 

2504
01:34:47,648 --> 01:34:48,849
I DON'T THINK THAT IS SOMETHING 

2505
01:34:48,849 --> 01:34:50,484
I HAVE HEARD BEFORE FROM HIM. 

2506
01:34:50,484 --> 01:34:53,020
>> I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT EITHER.

2507
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:58,125
HE BASICALLY SAID -- HE CALLED 

2508
01:34:58,125 --> 01:35:02,463
ELIZABETH WARREN BY A WORD, 

2509
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:02,896
POCAHONTAS. 

2510
01:35:02,896 --> 01:35:05,699
ELIZABETH WARREN ONCE CLAIMED 

2511
01:35:05,699 --> 01:35:08,569
THAT SHE IS PART CHEROKEE. 

2512
01:35:08,569 --> 01:35:10,070
SHE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME 

2513
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:12,606
PROVING A. HE SAID IF I EVER 

2514
01:35:12,606 --> 01:35:13,641
HAVE TO DEBATE ELIZABETH WARREN 

2515
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:18,512
IN A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE DOWN 

2516
01:35:18,512 --> 01:35:19,914
THE ROAD, I THINK WHAT I WILL 

2517
01:35:19,914 --> 01:35:22,116
DO IS I WILL GET ONE OF THOSE 

2518
01:35:22,116 --> 01:35:25,619
DNA KITS. 

2519
01:35:25,619 --> 01:35:27,021
I THINK SHE NEEDS TO TEST HER 

2520
01:35:27,021 --> 01:35:28,656
DNA TO SEE IF SHE IS IN FACT 

2521
01:35:28,656 --> 01:35:29,056
NATIVE AMERICAN. 

2522
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:30,491
HE DID NOT USE THE TERM NATIVE 

2523
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:31,725
AMERICAN, HE USED THE WORD 

2524
01:35:31,725 --> 01:35:31,958
INDIAN. 

2525
01:35:31,958 --> 01:35:33,327
I HAVE A FEELING THAT THAT WILL 

2526
01:35:33,327 --> 01:35:36,429
NOT GO OVER VERY WELL AMONG HIS 

2527
01:35:36,429 --> 01:35:36,997
OPPONENTS. 

2528
01:35:36,997 --> 01:35:40,234
I AM NOT SURE -- THE CROWD 

2529
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:41,669
SEEMED TO CHEER IT ON. 

2530
01:35:41,669 --> 01:35:49,376
I THINK THAT -- HE GETS THE 

2531
01:35:49,376 --> 01:35:51,011
CROWD FIRED UP AND IT WAS AT A 

2532
01:35:51,011 --> 01:35:52,213
POINT IN WHICH HE WAS GETTING 

2533
01:35:52,213 --> 01:35:52,847
THEM FIRED UP. 

2534
01:35:52,847 --> 01:35:54,148
HE FEEDS OFF OF THAT ENERGY. 

2535
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:55,282
YOU COULD SEE HIM GOING AND 

2536
01:35:55,282 --> 01:35:55,515
GOING. 

2537
01:35:55,515 --> 01:35:58,519
IN MY MIND, I THINKING THAT I 

2538
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:02,957
NEED TO LOOK AT MY EMAIL. 

2539
01:36:02,957 --> 01:36:03,423
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

2540
01:36:03,423 --> 01:36:05,593
