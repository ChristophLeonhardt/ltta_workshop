BUT THERE IS A GROWING NEED
FOR FAMILIES TO TAKE IN AND
ADOPT FOSTER CHILDREN.
SO WHY WOULD THE CITY OF
PHILADELPHIA BE SEVERING
THEIR TIES WITH THE CATHOLIC
SOCIAL SERVICES.
HELPING TO PROVIDE FAMILIES
WITH FOSTER CARE FOR
DECADES.
TRACE GALLAGHER FOLLOWING US
FROM OUR WEST COAST
NEWSROOM.
>> CATHOLIC SERVICES AS YOU
SAID HAS WORKED IN
PHILADELPHIA FOR 20-PLUS
YEARS.
ON AN AVERAGE DAY THE
CATHOLIC CHARITY SERVES 120
CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE.
SERVICES 100 DIFFERENT
FOSTER HOMES, AND LAST YEAR
THE ORGANIZATION WORKED WITH
MORE THAN 2200 AT RISK KIDS
IN PHILADELPHIA ALONE.
AND, YET, BACK IN MARCH,
SHORTLY AFTER ISSUING AN
EMERGENCY CALL FOR 300S IF
FOSTER FAMILIES.
THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA CUT
TIES TO CATHOLIC SOCIAL
SERVICES DENOUNCING IT AS
DISCRIMINATORY AND LAUNCHING
AN INVESTIGATION ITS
PRACTICES.
WHY IN BECAUSE THE CATHOLIC
CHARITY HOLDS CATHOLIC
BELIEFS ABOUT SAME SEX
MARRIAGE AND HAS A POLICY OF
PLACING EVERY FOSTER CHILD
WITH A MOM AND A DAD.
PHILADELPHIA MAYOR JIM KENNY
SAYS, QUOTE:  WE CANNOT USE
TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO FUND
ORGANIZATIONS THAT
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE
BECAUSE OF THEIR SEXUAL
ORIENTATION OR BECAUSE OF
THEIR SAME SEX MARRIAGE
STATUS.
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.
SO, WHILE THE CITY FIGHTS
IDENTITY POLITICS, TONIGHT
HUNDREDS OF KIDS REMAIN IN
GROUP HOMES INSTEAD OF
FOSTER HOMES.
SHARON FULTON HAS BEEN A
PHILADELPHIA FOSTER PARENT,
TAKING IN 40 CHILDREN.
HER HOME HAS BEEN EMPTY
SINCE APRIL.
SHE SAYS, QUOTE:  I'M USED
TO CHILDREN LAUGHING AND
RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE
STAIRS.
WHEN THE CHILDREN AREN'T
HERE, I FEEL LOST.
ADVOCATES FOR RELIGIOUS
LIBERTY HAVE NOW FILED A
FEDERAL LAWSUIT AGAINST
PHILADELPHIA BUT CATHOLIC
CHARITIES HAVE ALSO BEEN
FORCED OUT OF WELFARE
SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA,
MASSACHUSETTS, ILLINOIS, AND
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
AND THE ACLU IS TRYING TO
OVERTURN LAWS IN TEXAS AND
MICHIGAN.
LAWYERS WHO SPECIALIZE IN
LBGT LAW IN SOME RURAL AREAS
RELIGIOUSLY AFFILIATED
ADOPTION AGENCIES ARE THE
ONLY ONES WITHIN A
REASONABLE DISTANCE AND JUST
LAST WEEK, OKLAHOMA PASSED A
LAW THAT PROVIDES LEGAL
PROTECTIONS TO FAITH BASED
AGENCIES THAT WILL NOT PLACE
CHILDREN WITH SAME SEX
COUPLES.
MARTHA?
>> Martha: TRACE, THANK YOU.
MY NEXT GUEST KNOWS
FIRSTHAND HOW FOSTER CARE
CAN TURN AROUND A CHILD'S
LIFE.
SHE WAS REMOVED FROM HER
BIRTH FAMILY AT 5 YEARS OLD
AND PLACED WITH ANOTHER
FAMILY IN MICHIGAN SEVERAL
FAMILIES IN BETWEEN AND
FINALLY FACED WITH THIS
FAMILY THROUGH THE CATHOLIC
CHARITIES.
THIS IS A QUOTE FROM HER
PIECE SHOE SHE WROTE.
SAINT VINCENT RESCUES
CHILDREN FROM THE MOST
VULNERABLE, MOST
DISADVANTAGED BACK GROUNDS
LIKE MINE AND GIVES THEM A
CHANCE TO BE A PART OF A
LOVING FAMILY AND HAVE A
NORMAL, HEALTHY, HAPPY
CHILDHOOD.
SHAM ENTER FLORE JOINS ME
NOW
GOOD OSEE BOTH OF YOU AT
NIGHT.
SHAMBER, YOU SAY EVERY NIGHT
GUN FIGHTS WERE MY LULLABY.
I WAS EXPOSED TO DRUGS ABUSE
BEFORE MOST KIDS LEARN THEIR
ABCS.
THAT'S YOUR STORY.
>> YES, IT IS THAT IS ALL
VERY TRUE.
I WAS EXPOSED TO ALL THAT
VERY UNFIT CIRCUMSTANCES.
I'M SO GRATEFUL TO SAINT
VINCENT BECAUSE THEY SAVED
MY LIFE.
AND I THINK EVERY FOSTER KID
SHOULD HAVE THAT EXACT SAME
OPPORTUNITY.
AND I'M JUST HURT AND
CONFUSED AS TO WHY ANYONE
WOULD WANT TO REMOVE THAT
PRIVILEGE FROM ANY CHILD AND
TO REMOVE THOSE
OPPORTUNITIES AND
FAITH-BASED ADOPTION
AGENCIES.
>> Martha: YOU WERE BOUNCED
AROUND FROM A FEW FOSTER
HOMES AND YOU SAID EVERY
TIME YOU GOT TO ONE.
YOU WERE SEPARATED FROM YOUR
SIBLINGS.
EVERY TIME YOU GOT TO ONE
YOU HOPES THIS WOULD BE YOUR
FOREVER FAMILY.
>> CORRECT.
>> Martha: WHEN SAINT
VINCENT ENTERED THE PICTURE
THEY PUT YOU AND YOUR
SIBLINGS BACK TOGETHER AND
THAT'S WHERE YOU SAVED,
RIGHT?
>> YES.
>> Martha: NOW YOU ARE
WORKING ON A SINGING CAREER.
A LIGHT OF IT CAME FROM
SAINT VINCENT AND A LOT
COMES FROM YOU.
GOOD FOR YOU.
HOW DOES THE LAW WORK HERE?
BECAUSE, CATHOLIC CHARITIES
AND ALL THESE FAITH BASED
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE SUCH A
HISTORY OF BEING FOSTER
PARENTS.
THEY TAKE THE BURDENNIBLE
OFF A LOT OF THESE CITIES,
RIGHT?
>> RIGHT.
FOR A CITY WITH SO MUCH
HISTORY THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE
HAVE SHORT MEMORIES.
CATHOLIC SOCIAL SERVICES
HAVE BEEN SERVING THESE
CHILDREN FOR OVER A CENTURY.
AND ACTUALLY THE CITY ITSELF
HAS RANKED THEM AS ONE THE
BEST PROVIDERS WHEN IT COMES
TO FINDING MORE HOMES FOR
THESE CHILDREN WHEN WE ARE
DEALING SUCH A CRITICAL NEED
AND CRISIS WITH A SHORTAGE
OF HOMES.
SO, WHAT THIS LAWSUIT ABOUT
IS PROTECTING THAT.
>> Martha: IN PHILADELPHIA
THERE ARE 300 KIDS LOOKING
FOR HOMES AND 6,000 IN THE
FOSTER CARE SYSTEM
CURRENTLY, RIGHT?
>> YEAH.
THE CITY, THE SAME MONTH
CATHOLIC SOCIAL SERVICES PUT
OUT URGENT REQUEST FOR 300
ADDITIONAL FAMILIES.
>> Martha: WHERE ARE THE
KIDS GOING TO GOVERNMENTAL
THAT'S A QUESTION.
CATHOLIC SOCIAL SERVICES
SUPERVISES AND SUPPORTS OVER
100.
>> Martha: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
A SAME SEX COUPLE COMES TO A
CATHOLIC ORGANIZATION AND
SAYS YOU WOULD LIKE TO
FOSTER A CHILD.
>> CATHOLIC SOCIAL SERVICE
ALSO NEVER TURNED.
THEY WILL MAKE SURE THEY ARE
ABLE TO ADOPT BY REFERRING
THEM TO ONE OF 26 AGENCIES
THAT CAN MEET THEIR NEEDS.
>> Martha: SOUNDS LIKE A
GOOD ARRANGEMENT.
WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE,
SHAMBER, BEFORE DID YOU GO?
>> AS YOU ALREADY STATED, AT
THE AGE OF 5, GUNS AND
SIRENS WERE MY LULLABY, AND
THAT'S SO TRUE TO ME, AND I
WAS EXPOSED TO GANGS AND
PROSTITUTION AND DRUGS AND
SAINT VINCENT GAVE ME AN
OPPORTUNITY AND A LOVING
FAMILY AND I WOULDN'T WANT
ANY OTHER CHILD TO MISS OUT
ON THAT.
THAT IS UNDERGOING THE SAME
SITUATIONS AND I JUST DON'T
SEE WHY ANYBODY WOULD WANT
TO TAKE THAT AWAY WHEN IT'S
SUCH A NATIONAL CRISIS.
>> Martha: DO YOU WRITE IN
YOUR MUSIC ABOUT YOUR
EXPERIENCES GROWING UP.
>> I DO.
I ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE OTHER
PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN
OVERCOME THEIR
CIRCUMSTANCES.
>> Martha: GOOD FOR YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Martha: GOOD LUCK TO YOU,
