WELCOME TO WISEGUYS.
I DON'T THINK WE WILL HAVE
MUCH TROUBLE WITH THIS PANEL.
JEANINE WAS A DISTRICT
ATTORNEY, JUDGE, AUTHOR OF THE
NUMBER ONE NEW YORK TIMES
BESTSELLER, LIARS, LEAKERS AND
LIBERALS AND HOSTED JUSTICE
WITH JUDGE JEANINE SATURDAYS
AT 9:00 P.M.
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU.
MOLLY IS SENIOR EDITOR OF THE
FEDERALIST AND FOX NEWS
CONTRIBUTOR.
CHARLES HURT, CHARLES IS AN
OPINION EDITOR AND COLUMNIST
FOR THE WASHINGTON TIMES AND A
FOX NEWS INTERPRETER.
ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE
HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY AND
PRESIDENT OF FLESHER NEWS.
BRET CAVANAGH, IS IT OVER?
HE'S CONFIRMED, BUT I DON'T
THINK IT'S OVER.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE
IN THE COUNTRY POLITICALLY IN
TERMS OF PARTIES AND CULTURE.
IT SEEMS TO ME THIS WAS A BIG
EVENT.
WE HIT A NEW LOW AND THINGS
GOT PERSONAL AND SO NASTY.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FIVE
PEOPLE MADE SEXUAL ACCUSATIONS
AGAINST HIM AND THEN THE MEDIA
PUT THEM ALL ON THE AIR
UNFILTERED AND IT JUST FELL
APART ON HIS OWN.
WHEN YOU MAKE IT ABOUT A MAN
BEING A RAPIST, THAT'S A NEW
LOW.
>> PREVIOUSLY, I AGREE WITH
YOU, IT MAY HAVE BEEN ABOUT
CONSERVATIVE PHILOSOPHY OR
SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR
INAPPROPRIATE COMMENTS, THIS
WAS --DASH, THIS WAS ABOUT AN
ACCUSATION THAT WOULD LAND
ANYONE IN JAIL FOR 25 YEARS,
AND THAT IS A NEW LOW.
IN THE END, HE IS GOING TO
HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT MCAFEE
WAS ALSO A NEW LOW IN TERMS OF
THE TRIBALISM THAT WE SEE IN
PLAY, YOU EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE
PART OF A POLITICAL PARTY, BUT
WHEN SOMETHING SO HORRIBLE IS
HAPPENING, YOU WOULD HOPE
THERE WOULD BE MEN AND WOMEN
OF VIRTUE WHO STAND UP AND SAY
THIS IS RIDICULOUS, THIS CAN'T
GO ON, AND SO THAT WAS WORSE
THAN WE SAW IN THE CLARENCE
THOMAS HEARINGS.
>> I HAVE TO SAY, WHEN I LOOK
ACROSS THE AISLE OF THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, I CANNOT
FIND A SINGLE PERSON THAT I
THOUGHT WAS BEING ANYTHING
OTHER THAN FUNDAMENTALLY
UNFAIR AND OFTEN INCREDIBLY
DISHONEST, OBVIOUSLY DONALD
TRUMP WON THIS FIGHT, BUT THE
OTHER PERSON WHO CAME OUT A
WINNER IS CHUCK SCHUMER
BECAUSE GOING BACK TO THOSE
BUSH NOMINEES, CHUCK SCHUMER
MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO
TURN THE JUDICIARY INTO A NEW
IDEOLOGICAL ATTITUDE AND HE
SUCCEEDED IN DOING THAT.
THAT'S WHAT WE SAW.
WE SAW AN IDEOLOGICAL,
POLITICAL FIGHT OVER A
NOMINEE, OVER A POSITION
THAT'S NOT SUPPOSED BE
IDEOLOGICAL FOR.
>> I HAVE THIS THOUGHT, I'VE
BEEN THINKING ABOUT IS A LOT,
AND THAT IS WHEN THE FIRST TWO
WERE TALKING ABOUT CLEARANCE,
WHO SAID
WHO SITD
WHO SITS ON THE COURT,
BOB WAS OFFERED TEACHING
PHYSICIANS AT DIFFERENT LAW
SCHOOLS.
NOT SO WITH CAVANAGH, RIGHT,
HE'S NOT INVITED BACK TO
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL TO TEACH.
THAT YALE FACULTY, WHICH WHEN
HE WAS ANNOUNCED EMBRACED
HIM.
PEOPLE JUST KEPT SAYING THIS
IS A JOB INTERVIEW.
A MAN'S ENTIRE LIFE AND
REPUTATION AND NAME AND HONOR
WERE BEING DESTROYED.
THAT'S WHY YOU SAW A LOT OF
WOMEN REACT NEGATIVELY WHO
CARE AND LOVE ABOUT THE MEN IN
OUR LIVES AND TO SEE HOW
QUICKLY THAT CAN BE DESTROYED
BY THINKING THROUGH.
>> YOU SAID SOMETHING EARLIER
ABOUT PEOPLE OF VIRTUE AND
THIS WAS A MOMENT THAT TESTED
PEOPLE OF VIRTUE AND HOW THEY
ACT.
WE THOUGHT HOW DIANE FEINSTEIN
HANDLED THE INITIAL CLAIM.
PUT ASIDE FOR A SECOND WHETHER
SHE SHOULD HAVE RELEASED HER
EARLIER OR HELD THAT LATER,
THE VIRTUOUS THING TO DO WOULD
HAVE BEEN TO SAY THIS IS A
SERIOUS ALLEGATION, A TEST OF
THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND
ALSO A WOMAN WHO WANTS
PRIVACY.
I MUST, FROM A MORAL POINT OF
VIEW, YOU MUST DEAL WITH THIS
PRIVATELY AND IMMEDIATELY AND
SHE DIDN'T DO THAT.
>> SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO
RE-CREATE THE WHEEL HERE.
THERE WERE WAYS TO DEAL WITH
THE ISSUES.
THEY COULD'VE DONE IT QUIETLY,
