1
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:08,841
>>  WHILE OTHER WORLD LEADERS

2
00:00:08,841 --> 00:00:11,310
AND EVEN SOME OF THE SUPPORTERS

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,446
ON CAPITOL HILL AREN'T A FAN OF

4
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,781
THE PRESIDENT'S NEW TARIFFS,

5
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:17,783
AMERICAN VOTERS ARE MORE

6
00:00:17,783 --> 00:00:19,085
OPTIMISTIC THAN EVER ABOUT HOW

7
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,187
THE PRESIDENT IS NAVIGATING THE

8
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:21,554
ECONOMY.

9
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:24,723
A NEW FOX NEWS POLL, 50% OF

10
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:25,891
AMERICANS APPROVE OF PRESIDENT

11
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:28,594
TRUMP'S HANDLING OF THE ECONOMY.

12
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:31,730
HERE TO WAY IN ROSS COMISKEY.

13
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,299
ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

14
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,701
THIS IS MY QUESTION, YOU'VE GOT

15
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:37,136
THE DOW AND STOCK MARKETS NEAR

16
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:38,771
RECORD HIGHS, UNEMPLOYMENT NEAR

17
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:41,107
RECORD LOWS, HUGE INNOVATION IN

18
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,375
PLACES LIKE DENVER WHERE YOU

19
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,543
LIVE.

20
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:47,012
52% OF AMERICANS APPROVE HOW THE

21
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:47,913
PRESIDENT IS HANDLING OF THE

22
00:00:47,913 --> 00:00:49,748
ECONOMY AND WHAT ARE THE OTHER

23
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:50,382
48% COMPLAINING ABOUT?

24
00:00:50,382 --> 00:00:53,352
>> WELL, A LOT OF THE ISSUES

25
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:54,653
WHERE DONALD TRUMP INTERACTS

26
00:00:54,653 --> 00:00:55,955
WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN ANY

27
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,790
WAY, TRADE, IMMIGRATION, FOREIGN

28
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,091
POLICY GENERALLY, THEY'RE A

29
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:00,259
LITTLE MORE NEGATIVE ABOUT, BUT

30
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:02,695
I ALSO THINK SOME OF IT IS JUST

31
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,797
NO MATTER WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

32
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:06,265
DOES, SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST BOUND

33
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:07,399
AND DETERMINED IN THEIR OWN

34
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:08,701
MINDS, I'M JUST NOT GOING TO

35
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,504
LIKE THIS GUY AND WE SAW IT WITH

36
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,905
OTHER PRESIDENTS AS WELL, BUT

37
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:13,939
MORE WITH TRUMP THAN WITH OTHERS

38
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:15,708
AP REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

39
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,243
ARE THEY GOING TO VOTE BASED ON

40
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,579
WHETHER THEY LIKE HIM OR LIKE

41
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:21,480
3.8% UNEMPLOYMENT.

42
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,515
LELAND: IT'S FASCINATING YOU

43
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,049
BRING THAT UP.

44
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:26,452
OUR FRIENDS OVER AT AXIOS

45
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:29,321
BROUGHT UP THESE DATA POINTS

46
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:29,889
THAT WERE PROFOUND.

47
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:33,025
IF YOU WERE TO FORECAST THE 2018

48
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:34,393
MIDTERMS HISTORICALLY BY

49
00:01:34,393 --> 00:01:36,562
PRESIDENTIAL APPROVAL, THE

50
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:38,230
G.O.P. WOULD LOSE 68 SEATS.

51
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,899
VIEW OF THE ECONOMY, BASED OFF

52
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,401
THE POLLS WE JUST SHOWED YOU THE

53
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:44,403
G.O.P. WOULD GAIN 55 SEATS.

54
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:46,705
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING IN THE

55
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:47,473
MIDDLE THERE.

56
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:50,176
>> YEAH, I AGREE WITH YOU.

57
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:50,609
ABSOLUTELY.

58
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:51,510
I THINK IT SOUNDS TRITE, BUT

59
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,179
IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO WHO

60
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,914
IS MORE MOTIVATED.

61
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,448
IT HAS FELT LIKE DEMOCRATS WERE

62
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:58,317
MORE MOTIVATED TO GET OUT TO THE

63
00:01:58,317 --> 00:02:00,319
POLLS IN THIS CYCLE THAN

64
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,253
REPUBLICANS, BUT THE PROBLEM FOR

65
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:03,122
DEMOCRATS IS THEY'RE NOT REALLY

66
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:04,490
GIVING PEOPLE A REASON TO VOTE

67
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,325
FOR THEM OTHER THAN JUST SAYING,

68
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:07,576
I'M

69
00:02:07,576 --> 00:02:07,960
I'

70
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,230
I'M NOT THIS GU OR DON'T SUPPORT

71
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,332
THIS GUY AND THAT'S NOT USUALLY

72
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:13,666
ENOUGH.

73
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,900
LELAND: A LOT OF THE COMPLAINTS

74
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,168
YOU HEAR ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP

75
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:18,070
ARE ALMOST MORE ABOUT STYLE THAN

76
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,470
SUBSTANCE.

77
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,672
FOREIGN POLICY, HE GETS HIGH

78
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,907
MARKS FOR GOING TO KIM JONG-UN

79
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:23,275
IN SINGAPORE AND SITTING DOWN

80
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:24,677
FOR THIS MEETING, BUT AMERICANS

81
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,111
ARE STILL SKEPTICAL.

82
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:28,180
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

83
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,049
WILL NORTH KOREA EVER GIVE UP

84
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:30,849
ITS NUKES.

85
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:34,086
NOW 28% VERSUS 60 NO.

86
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:37,489
MARCH 2018, 16%-76 SAID NO.

87
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:39,625
SO YOU'VE HAD ABOUT 12% MORE

88
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,060
AMERICANS NOW SAY THEY MIGHT

89
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,895
GIVE UP THEIR NUKES.

90
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:46,165
IN TERMS OF MIDTERM ELECTION

91
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,666
POLITICS, HOW IMPORTANT ARE YOU

92
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,368
SEEING THIS SUMMIT?

93
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:51,470
>> I THINK IT'S ENORMOUS.

94
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,271
I THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS STAKED

95
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:54,807
A LOT OF OF HIS OWN CREDIBILITY

96
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,775
ON IT AS A DEALMAKER AND WHEN

97
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:58,410
THIS FIRST STARTED GOING ON, A

98
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,112
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING, THIS

99
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:01,347
IS VERY HIGH STAKES AND IT'S

100
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,148
GOING TO LEAD TO WAR OR NOT AND

101
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:04,683
I DON'T THINK THAT REALLY IS THE

102
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:05,985
AREA WHERE IT'S HIGH STAKES.

103
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,620
I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY HIGH

104
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,787
STAKES FOR DOMESTIC POLITICS.

105
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:10,990
I THINK THAT TRUMP HAS A LOT

106
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,126
RIDING ON THIS AND TO THE EXTENT

107
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:15,494
THAT HIS NUMBERS ARE KIND OF

108
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:17,930
NEGATIVE IN AREAS THAT DEAL WITH

109
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,298
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, THIS IS

110
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:21,467
A WAY WHERE HE COULD CHANGE THAT

111
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:22,368
ALMOST OVERNIGHT.

112
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,335
LELAND: EVEN HAWKISH MEMBERS OF

113
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:25,037
THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS UP ON

114
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:26,372
CAPITOL HILL, EVEN HAWKISH

115
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,240
MEMBERS WHO ARE FANS OF

116
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,074
PRESIDENT TRUMP WORRY THAT FOR

117
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:31,543
JUST THE REASONS YOU POINT OUT,

118
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:34,146
THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE

119
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:35,381
DEALITIS, ESSENTIALLY BEING

120
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,482
WILLING TO DO ANYTHING KIM

121
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,083
JONG-UN WANTS TO GET A DEAL,

122
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,786
EVEN IF IN MANY VIEW, IT WOULD

123
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:43,222
BE A BAD DEAL, AGREE?

124
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:44,356
>> I DON'T AGREE.

125
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:45,658
I THINK THAT BARACK OBAMA WAS

126
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,926
THAT GUY, AND I THINK THAT

127
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:49,461
DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY SAID

128
00:03:49,461 --> 00:03:50,229
EXPLICITLY, MAYBE IT WAS

129
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,531
YESTERDAY, I'M WILLING TO WALK

130
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:52,865
AWAY.

131
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,166
I DID IT ONCE BEFORE.

132
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,502
I'M WILLING TO WALK AWAY AGAIN.

133
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,470
I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT FOR

134
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,074
DONALD TRUMP'S OWN PSYCHE AS

135
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:02,541
WELL--

136
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,343
I THINK IT'S BETTER TO GET A

137
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:05,744
GOOD DEAL THAN NO DEAL.

138
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:06,979
LELAND: TO PUSH BACK, THE

139
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:08,447
PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS WILLING TO

140
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:10,883
TALK AWAY FROM A DEAL WITH ZTE,

141
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,719
AND THE CHINESE AND SO MANY NOW

142
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,653
EVEN REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING HE

143
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:15,754
ROLLED OVER ON THAT ONE.

144
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:17,356
>> AND I THINK HE DID, I AGREE

145
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:18,524
WITH THAT CRITICISM.

146
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,391
LELAND: WHY DO YOU TRUST HIM NOW

147
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:20,926
THAT HE'S WILLING TO HOLD OUT

148
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:22,294
FOR A GOOD DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA

149
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:23,862
WHEN YOU'RE SAYING HE ROLLED

150
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:24,663
OVER WITH CHINA?

151
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:27,066
>> YEAH, THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION.

152
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,334
I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT

153
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:31,070
THE NORTH KOREA THING IS SO MUCH

154
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,307
MORE OUT IN PUBLIC.

155
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:37,576
ZTE, THOSE WHO PAY ATTENTION TO

156
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:40,346
POLITICS NOTICE THAT, BUT THIS

157
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,580
NOT SO MUCH.

158
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,015
NOT JUST AMERICA IS TALKING

159
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:45,317
ABOUT IT, THE WORLD IS TALKING

160
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:46,418
ABOUT IT AND I THINK TRUMP WILL

161
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:47,753
THINK ABOUT IT DIFFERENTLY AND I

162
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:50,689
THINK HE DID THE ZTE THINK IN

163
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:52,257
ORDER TO GET MORE HELP FROM

164
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:53,592
CHINA BEHIND THE SCENES ON THE

165
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:54,526
NORTH KOREA THING.

166
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:55,594
SO, THAT'S MY TAKE THERE.

167
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:57,529
LELAND: WELL, WE'VE SEEN THE

168
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:59,131
CHINESE USE NORTH KOREA AS

169
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:00,366
LEVERAGE IN THESE TRADE DEALS.

170
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,934
ROSS, THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.

171
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,469
WE COULD TALK TO YOU A LOT

172
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:03,836
LONGER.

173
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,804
YOU'RE HEADED TO SINGAPORE, SO

174
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:07,106
IF THIS SUMMIT KEEPS STRETCHING

175
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,141
OUT LIKE THE PRESIDENT SAID IT

176
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:10,376
MIGHT, YOU'RE GOING TO BE OUR

177
00:05:10,376 --> 00:00:00,000
MAN ON THE GROUND IN SINGAPORE,
