thank you you have a unique backstory and I guarantee no one else has a back story like yours to prove it I'm going to show our audience some pictures of you let's start with this one here have a look on my laptop this is stunning I'm going to show a picture of your grandmother and your mother this is where your musical inspiration your musical education started would you explain because a lot of people be looking at these pictures going say what tell us well I learned to sing at home with my mother and my grandmother in the kitchen a lot of times people will ask my mother who also was a vocal coach to train them to sing and they think that she's gonna you know set up at a piano and teach them notes and she'll make them come you know shuck corn and pick greens and because for traditional people singing is like breathing it's like praying it is a part of what you do as a person as a part of the community you know as so she'll have you come feel the song read the song do chores you know it's just it's a part of like a living a part of expression when I was a small girl but always seeing my mother my grandmother people would call them and they would travel all around to heal people to take pain out of their bodies to sing into their bodies and you know later on you may look at it doctors use the vibration of sound to move matter inside of bodies and they were doing this forget voices you know not educated in the Western sense but they knew that the power of sound and vibrations so that's kind of how I started my both my parents I mean my parents and my grandparents had already converted to Islam but my grandmother was a choir director from Chicago so you know other we were Muslim she was still teaching me these gospel songs and these spirituals from slavery and she would teach me traditional native songs that we had to relearn after the freedom of religion Act was passed for Native Americans that wasn't until the 70s we couldn't practice our culture to the 70s so you know a lot of the culture that was lost because of Indian boarding schools and natives being forced to forget who we were we had to go back and relearn those things so by the time I was born you know my grandmother was just starting to relearn the language because we couldn't even talk about it you couldn't even talk about being Indian people thought she wasn't Mexican you know and and me and you know Mexicans are indigenous to that's why you see so many similarities seeing the southern tribes come in it's an imaginary border you know they're indigenous as well and so people didn't know that she was Choctaw so later on she went back to learn the traditional ways and she was able to not to me you talk about community Muslim community afro-american community african-american community and also of course the Native American community in addition to all of that you're from not too far away from here Baltimore there's also that community there coming out on Twitter in force one person here grandma rage tweets in firstly she has a hometown favorite her powerful vocals edgy and gritty lyrics and message one of my favorite bands not only supports her artistry but contributed to her name that would be the roots from Philadelphia the colors of her attire and sounds were an overall great experience and I would love to see more so a couple of people mentioned your name I know you've been singing this professionally since like 17 but the name muumuu fresh came a little bit later talk to us about yes that history like thought you know my good friend Black Thought from the roots they were the first group that I like toured internationally was I had my own band at the time but um that's the first group I toured internationally with and I feel like it just I'm not even really sure I feel like it just came like playfully on stage where I was like a lot of people have a hard time saying my name you know and my mom would call me moon with Shia whatever and it just I feel like he just said it one night like introducing DJ muumuu fresh you know it was like a joke and then we just kept it kind of kept happening and I think it was my my web designer who was like why don't we get the URL muumuu fresh because it might be hard for people to spell your name and it just kind of stuck every time I was saying it people would remember it and then it just sucking up I'm at the airport people like yes the first song you're gonna do for us perform for us it's called impact mm-hmm toss what do we need to know about that before we hear it everyone asks about this song so this song is actually in the Lakota language the important thing about the Lakota they they they held on to their culture I feel like a lot longer than some of the Eastern tribes who were kind of forced to assimilate because of the the building the the close contact with Europeans they were forced to assimilate earlier and lost a lot more of our culture the Lakota a fierce warriors you know and this story in Pattaya it talks about the American Indian Wars and about the women who waved their shots waiting for their husband to come to come back from war hoping that they were victorious and my mom was singing the song to me when I when I was a baby you know and now it is a song it has become a lullaby it's for us not to forget the commitment to our people and the struggle that we fought to still be here the right to be and exist and she's a singing to me as a baby and um and you're gonna sing it for us now I am right to perform that song inkpots uh she gets ready for that I want you to take a look at this tweet on my laptop this is from awesome Austin that's his handle Austin says her music is spiritual inspirational and uplifting the ancestral song she starts out with is so profound her ancestral poetry is superb she is a spiritual being maximizing the human experience thank you my Munna for your voice and for your talent my Muno take it away but I want a now watch a she chose a my am take away no no one day no one day she chose a why am I in you know what she shows my no one Jane one day she shall save my my in she chose a my I'd say she shows but Shh I am the daughter of freedom fighters and farmers bootleggers a number running copper color like clays swag cooler than Indian Sun let about Oracle's and seers water pours and healers once the Warriors now killers and drug dealers Mississippi Choctaw Creek raisin bottom awesome on the streets carefully my pack of wolves they care for me prayerfully it only lose a limb fooling with them I am the product of a gypsy and a kingpin I exist somewhere between Egypt and sing-sing going to be a revolution every since a we thing prevail getting delivery of the memories I was drinking I am Mississippi red clay dirt roads - a tobacco field prayer ties sweet grass peyote I survived the Trail of Tears and slavery this here's what you call unmatched bravery yeah all about the money the baby you had to pay the same we call it reparations Singh not in school but in ways you wouldn't understand see singing wasn't about songs it was about sound in the laying on of hands I watched my grandmother pull pain from the aching bodies of sobbing grown men with a sound that started on harp it escaped her lips and made them whole again we black Indian she this red and brown blood this ceremony this sacrifice is nothing you could ever teach unless you crawl back into the black room of the healing lodge to reverse yourself brand-new and learned that we are just spiritual means heavens and nothing else is ever true we're too spiritual beings having a human experience that was spectacular our audience thinks so as well divinity rocks among the many people using Twitter to share their thoughts on your voice and on your lyrics divinity writes she utilizes her prowess as an emcee in the truest sense of the word to bear her soul and paint a picture of her struggles and triumphs intelligently which is encouraging refreshing and inspiring so that's just one of the many praises people are singing but also a question this person big bro says I love the fact that she tells her story of resilience and I want to know what are her views on the importance of storytelling in the black community that's what you seem to use your lyrics for well yeah I mean that's always been kind of a staple you know in the black community is it's the Oracle that's how we passed down who we are I mean even a lot of the escape songs my grandmother would teach me those are the songs that were the role maps to escape from slavery that people thought were just songs but they're not you know they're maps to freedom and they are the things that anchor us to our community and remind us of how good god is and at some point we're going to get over it connects us in relationship to God you know and that to me is why we've been so resilient is because of that relationship with God you were homeschooled which explains so much about this independent spirit but when you went to school you realized that what you were learning didn't kind of fit in with your worldview so songwriting was your escape yeah so what I realized about going to public school is that school wasn't it wasn't about learning wasn't about education it wasn't about having a discourse that a debate coming to a higher sense of understanding it really was about retaining specific information that would be on a test long enough to get a good score and everyone gets funded again and we do it I mean I would actually get like sat out of class for asking too many questions and because I was home-schooled I was taught to be an analytical thinker to not just take information for face value you know when I'm giving that information I said okay well let's cross-reference it with these other resources but you know as a 14-year old no one wants to listen to you say that and I feel very blessed that my mother educated me in a non-traditional sense like everything was education you know we could do beadwork and that's like that counts as a school credit in her book you know we can cook we can make songs and I wanted to be a thinker more than I wanted to be a singer and at the time I felt like well if I can't be both and I'd rather be a thinker so I left the music for that time it just became a writer's I realized how to combine them you know Tony here on Twitter says my mother uses if it Yousef isn't naturally talented down-to-earth positive person with great character and she's not afraid to be honest with her music so it's that last line that Tony writes that I wanted to pivot to the not being afraid to be honest you tried out for a little-known show in the u.s. American Idol mm-hmm and eventually you were told you're not American enough they said I was too ethnic I was too ethnic and if they have an ethnic Idol they'll be sure to give me a call yeah so what does it even mean I mean it shows you where the values lie you know I mean you know I said I wasn't even offend I say you're right you got it because we're gonna do this in spite of you like you know the revolution will come to pass even if it's not on the American Idol but you know God bless them you know everyone's a part of your journey me God has things happen for specific reasons to push you in different directions so I'm grateful for it I listen to your music and I hear the real world I hear America in your lyrics what's happening right now in terms of what's happening right now socially politically what's your next song going to be what is really I need to write about this right now what is bugging you even say anything is bugging me as much as what is inspiring me and lifting me up is God's love it really is a connection to spirit and and if each person could become more in tune with their own spirit and their own if your mission everyday is the elevation of your soul we wouldn't have a lot of the craziness that's happening each person made their own spirit their business their day-to-day to-do list is the elevation of one soul so a lot of the music I'm working on right now is really about using sound as as a healing tool to uplift the spirit and soul and to take us out of a dark place that dinner of iniquity where we where we feel disconnected from gods like God's love because the closer we are in relationship so that the better off we're gonna be we're gonna make different decisions everything about the way we live our lives are gonna be different when we're in relationship with God I want to share this from someone watching live on YouTube iMac says she teaches with her words like a lullaby but keeping us woke instead of putting us to sleep a little play on words there woke in the sense of being conscious and and and socially with it another person here this is on Twitter and they had so many questions for you I'm gonna just share one this is a Jay man who says they managed to restrict themselves to the questions below how about this one are there any artists on the African continent you would like to work with in the future and and I'll preface that by saying you've already worked with one of our former stream guests that me could see I could see yeah we recorded a song together we we performed together didn't African shine you know I love DeVito's music I just I enjoy him a lot what am I like childhood favorite so I would just fall out on the floor my mother played her all of my life I would love angelique kidjo I would just fall out so were kids oh I want to play this this is a morning song and it brings you back to your roots and how you learn to sing and I just want to play this for people because you've got so many amazing different sounds have a listen to this everybody we Nene and I don't want to fade that out but I'm going to that's so gorgeous I know that with your next music project you want to get back to more spiritual music and this is spiritual music in it and it's sort of raw raw raw sense yeah yeah for sure I mean I'm so I'm so grateful for my mother I think when I was younger I did not understand or maybe didn't appreciate it as much and I looked at it as being separate like my native identity was kind of separate from my african-american identity but now it's it's the same it's it's just a part of why I Gavin that was your mother there singing with you and who else was about the arm neva cedilla yeah she's a singer from Baltimore yeah well since you have been in this industry for so long and that video of course is proof of that this is will here on Twitter who says does she feel the industry has changed in its attitude towards women from when she first got involved to now I think the industry has pressure on it to change its attitude I don't think the culture has changed though I think people are in hiding more now because they are worried about being exposed but I don't feel that the that people truly get why there's an issue with degrading women which is really problematic you know because whenever you cover the symptoms it's gonna come back at some point and that's the part that I think is um you know disheartening a little bit but I mean I try to do my best especially in conversation cuz these conversations happen all in studios and on shows and we talk about these things a lot too I really try to help to educate and for men to understand when you play a part in the reason why it's so detrimental to the next coming generations of young girls and women who who just want to do our craft and do our art you know we want to come to work like you come to work and live our purpose out you know without these other hindrances so I mean I think it's good that things are being brought to the forefront because their lanes that are being open to women that were not open before especially for women with children especially in the music industry there's always been very taboo a very negative connotation to women who have children because your bodies belong to the industry it's not your own you know I'm gonna pause you there because you actually have a song that talks about women and and saying their names we're gonna end the show with a mix of two of my Munna songs one called miracle and the other is saying my name it's a song that references the 2015 death of an african-american woman Sandra bland here's a comment from a fan Misha Allen on what the song means to her I just wanted to share my thoughts on the song say my name by moon fresh and DJ dummy aka the vintage babies it just it blew me away when I first heard it the song that specifically highlights the death of Sandra bland and you know death by her hands of police and then again by the justice system and just hearing that this young black woman was being acknowledged in a sense that we haven't heard before it's the Manning at her existence be validated and fought for and that in and of itself is very emotional and empowering as well if I should die at the hands of the police and the baby say we're gonna call it a suicide you even question would you believe in my innocence would you even come to my defense would you believe in the good I've done over my name for the answers heroes eventually died shot with their hands in the sky your favorite revolutionaries give a bank of life and the internet would justify a reason to die we watched a wall making drunk out of Eden filmed in the highway all y'all can say was black women too mouthy unpacks searching my timeline see it people find time to criticize feelin is calling it a suicide nothing is impossible my struggle
