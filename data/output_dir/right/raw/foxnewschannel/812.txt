00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:13,491
>> Laura: DEMOCRATS HAVE

2
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:14,792
LAUNCHED A BLITZ OF USING TRUMP

3
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:16,260
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OF

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,129
SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR

5
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:19,663
PARENTS AND HOUSING THEM IN

6
00:00:19,663 --> 00:00:20,598
LITERALLY CONCENTRATION CAMPS

7
00:00:20,598 --> 00:00:22,233
ALONG THE BORDER.

8
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:24,068
LEFTIST POLITICIANS FROM

9
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:25,436
SENATORS TO HILLARY CLINTON TOOK

10
00:00:25,436 --> 00:00:26,337
THEIR BEST SHOT.

11
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:27,738
>> IT IS UNACCEPTABLE IN MY

12
00:00:27,738 --> 00:00:28,039
MIND.

13
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,008
I THINK IN THE MINDS AND HEARTS

14
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:32,409
OF MANY AMERICAN THAT SOMEONE

15
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,211
CAN JUSTIFY A POLICY OF

16
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:36,080
DELIBERATE HARM TO CHILDREN AS A

17
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,415
WAY TO GAIN LEGISLATIVE

18
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:37,782
LEVERAGE.

19
00:00:37,782 --> 00:00:39,483
>> IN FACT WHAT HE'S DOING IS

20
00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:42,319
HOLDING THESE KIDS AND THEIR

21
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:44,388
PARENTS HOSTAGE TO A WHOLE SET

22
00:00:44,388 --> 00:00:46,724
OF OTHER IMMIGRATION ISSUES.

23
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:48,192
>> SEPARATING FAMILIES IS NOT

24
00:00:48,192 --> 00:00:49,660
MANDATED BY LAW AT ALL.

25
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,230
THAT IS AN OUTRIGHT LIE.

26
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,432
AND IT'S INCUMBENT ON ALL OF US,

27
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:57,101
JOURNALISTS AND CITIZENS ALIKE,

28
00:00:57,101 --> 00:00:59,537
TO COLLEGES THAT.

29
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:11,348
>> Laura:

30
00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:14,885
TO COLLEGES THAT.
>> Laura: OKAY.

31
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:15,753
WELL, SHE SHOULD KNOW SOMETHING

32
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:16,253
ABOUT LINE, RIGHT?

33
00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:16,987
WITH EMOTIONS RUNNING THIS HIGH,

34
00:01:16,987 --> 00:01:17,588
IS IT A P.R. BATTLE THE

35
00:01:17,588 --> 00:01:18,189
ADMINISTRATION CAN WON.

36
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:18,923
LET'S DISCUSS ALL THIS WITH THE

37
00:01:18,923 --> 00:01:19,657
HEAD OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

38
00:01:19,657 --> 00:01:20,291
WE ARE PLEASED TO WELCOME

39
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,025
ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS.

40
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:21,525
FIRST TIME ON "THE

41
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:21,992
INGRAHAM ANGLE."

42
00:01:21,992 --> 00:01:22,726
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH

43
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:22,993
US.

44
00:01:22,993 --> 00:01:23,727
THERE'S A LOT TO GET TO TONIGHT.

45
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:24,395
YOU HEARD WHAT MRS. CLINTON

46
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:25,796
SAID, THAT THIS IS A LIE.

47
00:01:25,796 --> 00:01:27,598
IT'S NOT CAUSED BY THE OBAMA

48
00:01:27,598 --> 00:01:28,065
ADMINISTRATION.

49
00:01:28,065 --> 00:01:28,899
THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DONE.

50
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:30,935
THE PRESIDENT COULD PICK UP THE

51
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:32,970
PHONE TONIGHT AND STOP THIS

52
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,638
POLICY OF SEPARATING CHILDREN

53
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:36,040
FROM THEIR PARENTS.

54
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,741
WHAT'S THE REAL TRUTH THERE,

55
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:38,242
GENERAL SESSIONS?

56
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:40,811
>> I GUESS WHAT SHE IS SAYING IS

57
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:42,480
THE PRESIDENT COULD JUST ISSUE A

58
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,214
DIRECTIVE THAT EVERYBODY THAT

59
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:45,683
ENTERS THE COUNTRY UNLAWFULLY BE

60
00:01:45,683 --> 00:01:48,185
RELEASED INTO THE COUNTRY AND

61
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:49,787
NEVER BE APPREHENDED OR STOPPED

62
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:52,089
OR PROSECUTED FOR THE ILLEGAL

63
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:53,991
ENTRY.

64
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:56,393
WE HAVE WATCHED WHAT HAPPENED

65
00:01:56,393 --> 00:01:57,261
WITH THE OBAMA POLICIES, AND

66
00:01:57,261 --> 00:02:00,898
OVER THE YEARS, WE WENT FROM

67
00:02:00,898 --> 00:02:03,934
15,000 ILLEGAL ENTRIES TO

68
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:04,268
75,000.

69
00:02:04,268 --> 00:02:07,204
THIS IS A HUGE LOOPHOLE IN OUR

70
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:08,339
SYSTEM THAT'S ATTRACTING MORE

71
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:09,940
AND MORE PEOPLE AS MORE AND MORE

72
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,111
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT UNDER

73
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:15,079
PREVIOUS POLICIES, IF THEY WERE

74
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:16,647
ENTERING THE COUNTRY UNLAWFULLY,

75
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:17,815
NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.

76
00:02:17,815 --> 00:02:18,449
BUT WE ARE DOING THE RIGHT

77
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:19,016
THING.

78
00:02:19,016 --> 00:02:20,050
WE ARE TAKING CARE OF THESE

79
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:20,417
CHILDREN.

80
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:22,486
THEY ARE NOT BEING ABUSED.

81
00:02:22,486 --> 00:02:26,790
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES HOUSE

82
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,925
THEM IN GOOD CONDITIONS.

83
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:28,826
THEY WORK HARD AT IT.

84
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:31,829
WE SPENT A BILLION DOLLARS LAST

85
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,796
YEAR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

86
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:33,998
DID, IN TAKING CARE OF CHILDREN

87
00:02:33,998 --> 00:02:36,934
WHO ENTERED THE COUNTRY

88
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:37,334
UNLAWFULLY.

89
00:02:37,334 --> 00:02:40,104
LAURA, ONE MORE THING.

90
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:42,806
CHILDREN STILL TEND TO BE THE

91
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:43,374
UNACCOMPANIED MINORS.

92
00:02:43,374 --> 00:02:45,109
WE HAVE HAD A BIG SURGE IN

93
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:48,245
FAMILIES BRINGING CHILDREN OR

94
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:49,413
SOME ADULTS BRINGING CHILDREN

95
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:50,014
WITH THEM.

96
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:52,183
>> Laura: ONE OF THE SHELTERS

97
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:54,618
NOT TOO FAR FROM THE BORDER HAS

98
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:56,954
90% OF THE KIDS WHO ARE

99
00:02:56,954 --> 00:02:57,955
UNACCOMPANIED MINORS.

100
00:02:57,955 --> 00:02:58,689
10% WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR

101
00:02:58,689 --> 00:02:59,623
FAMILIES.

102
00:02:59,623 --> 00:03:01,659
JUST SO MY VIEWERS UNDERSTAND

103
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:02,226
THIS.

104
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:02,993
GENERAL SESSIONS.

105
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:04,361
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A FAMILY UNIT,

106
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:06,130
YOU SEE THEM ALL ON THE BRIDGES,

107
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,599
WHICH I THINK IS ABSURD THAT

108
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,234
THEY STAY ON THE BRIDGES NEAR

109
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:11,602
THE PORTS OF ENTRY NURSE

110
00:03:11,602 --> 00:03:12,403
SAN DIEGO.

111
00:03:12,403 --> 00:03:14,205
NOW, WHEN THEY GET PROCESSED IN,

112
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:15,139
IT IS SLOW.

113
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:17,575
THEY GET PROCESSED IN AND IF A

114
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:19,543
WOMAN SAYS THIS IS MY CHILD OR

115
00:03:19,543 --> 00:03:21,612
TWO CHILDREN, THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

116
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:23,214
ARE THEY SEPARATED IF THEY CLAIM

117
00:03:23,214 --> 00:03:25,149
ASYLUM, SAYING I WANT TO CLAIM

118
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:25,482
ASYLUM?

119
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:26,717
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MOTHER OF

120
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:28,686
THE CHILDREN AT THAT POINT?

121
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:31,021
>> IF THEY ENTER THE COUNTRY AT

122
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,223
A PORT OF ENTRY AND THERE ARE

123
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:34,325
MANY OF THOSE ALONG THE BORDER,

124
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:38,062
THEY ARE NOT VIOLATING THE LAW.

125
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:39,797
THE MOTHER OR FATHER IN THAT

126
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:41,799
CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD NOT BE

127
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:42,499
PROSECUTED IN THE FAMILIES ARE

128
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:46,003
STAYING TOGETHER.

129
00:03:46,003 --> 00:03:47,238
PRESUMABLY THEY ARE CLAIMING

130
00:03:47,238 --> 00:03:49,206
ASYLUM AND THEY WOULD NOT BE

131
00:03:49,206 --> 00:03:50,641
PROSECUTED AND NOT BE SEPARATED.

132
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:52,643
BUT IF THEY GO OUT IN THE

133
00:03:52,643 --> 00:03:56,814
DESERT, THEY CROSS A FENCE OR

134
00:03:56,814 --> 00:03:58,215
BARRIER, OUR OFFICERS HAVE TO

135
00:03:58,215 --> 00:03:59,516
IDENTIFY THEM.

136
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:00,184
FOLLOW THEM, APPREHEND THEM.

137
00:04:00,184 --> 00:04:01,218
THEY ARE VIOLATING THE LAW AND

138
00:04:01,218 --> 00:04:03,621
THE NEED TO BE PROSECUTED FOR

139
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:04,989
THAT.

140
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:07,725
HE SIMPLY CANNOT CONDONE THAT

141
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:08,225
KIND OF ACTIVITY.

142
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:11,195
WANT TO END THIS PROCESS OF

143
00:04:11,195 --> 00:04:12,630
CHILDREN BEING BROUGHT ACROSS

144
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,297
DANGEROUS TERRITORY, PLACING

145
00:04:13,297 --> 00:04:15,232
THOSE CHILDREN AT RISK.

146
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,600
IF THEY WANT TO CLAIM ASYLUM

147
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,402
FROM A LET THEM GO THROUGH THE

148
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:20,404
THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE

149
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:20,704
DONE.

150
00:04:20,704 --> 00:04:22,206
>> Laura: YEAH, I THINK MOST

151
00:04:22,206 --> 00:04:22,873
PEOPLE AREN'T UNDERSTANDING

152
00:04:22,873 --> 00:04:24,041
THIS.

153
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:24,775
I THINK MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT

154
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:26,910
IF YOU COME, EVEN THROUGH ONE OF

155
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,647
THE 25 PORTS OF ENTRY, YOU CAN

156
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:30,914
HAVE YOUR FAMILY SEPARATED.

157
00:04:30,914 --> 00:04:31,615
THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S WORKING.

158
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,818
IT'S A RARE CIRCUMSTANCE WHEN I

159
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:35,853
THINK THE BORDER PATROL PEOPLE

160
00:04:35,853 --> 00:04:37,721
KNOW THAT THIS PERSON IS NOT

161
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:38,455
RELATED TO THIS OTHER PERSON

162
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:40,024
THEY CAN FIGURE IT OUT PRETTY

163
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:42,192
QUICKLY IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

164
00:04:42,192 --> 00:04:43,360
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE

165
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,530
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT.

166
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,598
THIS IS HOW YOUR OPPONENT,

BEING THIS ISSUE.

00:04:54,972 --> 00:04:56,807
SIDING WHERE THE FAMILIES WERE

170
00:04:56,807 --> 00:04:57,508
SEPARATED, AND THAT'S WHY USE

171
00:04:57,508 --> 00:05:00,411
THAT PICTURE.

172
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:03,180
LOOK, I KNOW WE ARE NOT NAZI

173
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,048
GERMANY.

174
00:05:04,048 --> 00:05:04,548
ALL RIGHT?

175
00:05:04,548 --> 00:05:05,849
BUT THERE IS A COMMONALITY

176
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:06,150
THERE.

177
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:11,822

AMERICA.

179
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:13,424
IT ISN'T NAZI GERMANY, AND

180
00:05:13,424 --> 00:05:14,625
THAT'S A DIFFERENCE.

181
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,894
WE DON'T TAKE CHILDREN FROM

182
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:17,728
THEIR PARENTS.

183
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:20,331
UNTIL NOW.

GOING BACK TO ELEANOR ROOSEVELT.

00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:32,343
SHE HAS APPARENTLY WEIGHED IN AS

192
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:33,444
WELL.

193
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:35,145
GENERAL SESSIONS, WHAT'S GOING

194
00:05:35,145 --> 00:05:35,479
ON HERE?

195
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:38,615
>> IT'S A REAL EXAGGERATION.

196
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:39,650
IN NAZI GERMANY, THEY WERE

197
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,352
KEEPING THE JEWS FROM LEAVING

198
00:05:41,352 --> 00:05:42,886
THE COUNTRY BUT THIS IS A

199
00:05:42,886 --> 00:05:44,421
SERIOUS MATTER.

200
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:46,523
WE NEED TO THINK IT THROUGH, THE

201
00:05:46,523 --> 00:05:48,025
RATIONAL AND THOUGHTFUL ABOUT

202
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:48,659
IT.

203
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:49,993
WE WANT TO ALLOW ASYLUM FOR

204
00:05:49,993 --> 00:05:53,831
PEOPLE WHO QUALIFY FOR IT.

205
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:55,432
PEOPLE WHO WANT ECONOMIC

206
00:05:55,432 --> 00:05:56,200
MIGRATION FOR THEIR PERSONAL

207
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,134
FINANCIAL BENEFIT AND WHAT THEY

208
00:05:57,134 --> 00:06:01,238
THINK IS THEIR FAMILIES BENEFIT

209
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:03,774
IS NOT A BASIS FOR A CLAIM OF

210
00:06:03,774 --> 00:06:05,008
ASYLUM.

211
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:07,244
BUT THEY CAN MAKE THAT CLAIM.

212
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:08,412
WE WILL PROCESS IT.

213
00:06:08,412 --> 00:06:10,714
AND I WILL REVIEW THE SITUATION

214
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:12,249
AND MAKE A DECISION.

215
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:14,952
THOSE CHILDREN, IF THE PARENT

216
00:06:14,952 --> 00:06:15,686
BRINGS THEM ACROSS THE BORDER IN

217
00:06:15,686 --> 00:06:18,922
AN UNLAWFUL AREA AND THE PARENT

218
00:06:18,922 --> 00:06:19,690
IS DEPORTED, THEY WILL TAKE THE

219
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,825
CHILDREN HOME WITH THEM.

220
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:25,262
THAT IS TRUE.

221
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:26,263
IF THE PARENT CLAIMS ASYLUM AND

222
00:06:26,263 --> 00:06:27,965
IS ALLOWED TO STAY HERE, THAN

223
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:30,467
THE CHILDREN STAY HERE ALSO.

224
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:34,271
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TAKES

225
00:06:34,271 --> 00:06:34,605
CUSTODY.

226
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:39,143
>> Laura: GENERAL SESSIONS, IS

227
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:41,612
THIS POLICY IN PART USED AS A

228
00:06:41,612 --> 00:06:41,979
DETERRENT?

229
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:43,480
ARE YOU TRYING TO DETER PEOPLE

230
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,718
FROM BRINGING CHILDREN OR MINORS

231
00:06:47,718 --> 00:06:48,419
ACROSS THIS DANGEROUS JOURNEY?

232
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,421
IS THAT PART OF WHAT THE

233
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,555
SEPARATION IS ABOUT?

234
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:52,256
SLICK OF FUNDAMENTALLY WE ARE

235
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:54,224
ENFORCING THE LAW.

236
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:55,526
IF YOU BREAK INTO THE COUNTRY --

237
00:06:55,526 --> 00:06:58,061
>> Laura: IS IT A DETERRENT,

238
00:06:58,061 --> 00:06:58,429
SIR?

239
00:06:58,429 --> 00:07:00,631
ARE YOU CONSIDERING IT A

240
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:01,031
DETERRENT?

241
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:02,132
BECAUSE THE FACT THAT NO ONE WAS

242
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:05,302
BEING PROSECUTED FOR THIS AS A

243
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:08,038
FACTOR IN A FIVEFOLD

244
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:10,407
INCREASE IN FOUR YEARS IN THIS

245
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:10,741
KIND OF

246
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:11,608
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.

247
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:12,609
SO YES HOPEFULLY PEOPLE GET THE

248
00:07:12,609 --> 00:07:15,212
MESSAGE AND COME THROUGH THE

249
00:07:15,212 --> 00:07:17,147
BORDER AT THE PORT OF ENTRY AND

250
00:07:17,147 --> 00:07:19,216
NOT BREAK ACROSS THE BORDER

251
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:20,617
UNLAWFULLY.

252
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:21,819
>> Laura: LET ME GET YOUR

253
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:23,420
QUICK THOUGHTS, SIR, IF YOU

254
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,788
WOULD ON THIS LOOMING CHILD WITH

255
00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:25,456
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS.

256
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:27,157
THEY ARE TRYING TO GET THOSE

257
00:07:27,157 --> 00:07:29,059
DOCUMENTS, AS YOU KNOW, FROM

258
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:29,927
YOUR DEPARTMENT AND TREY GOWDY

259
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:31,962
OVERSIGHT CHAIR SAID YESTERDAY

260
00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:33,597
OFFICIALS WILL BE HELD IN

261
00:07:33,597 --> 00:07:35,666
CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS OF THE DOJ

262
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,434
AND FBI DO NOT COMPLY WITH

263
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:38,402
SUBPOENAS.

264
00:07:38,402 --> 00:07:40,237
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?

265
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:42,239
>> WELL, WE'VE GONE A LONG WAY

266
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,308
IN DEALING WITH THAT.

267
00:07:44,308 --> 00:07:47,845
THE FBI'S WORKED HARD ON THAT I

268
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:48,145
THINK.

269
00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:53,617
AN AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED WITH

270
00:07:53,617 --> 00:07:55,953
MR. TREY GOWDY AND

271
00:07:55,953 --> 00:07:56,386
MR. GOODLATTE.

272
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:57,287
STAFFERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF OF

273
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:59,556
JUSTICE AND FBI LOOKING AT THE

274
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:01,425
RECORDS.

275
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:03,093
I THINK THAT'S MOVING ALONG

276
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:03,494
PRETTY WELL.

277
00:08:03,494 --> 00:08:05,362
>> Laura: THEY ARE OUT OF

278
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:08,499
PATIENCE.

279
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:09,600
GENERALIZATIONS -- GENERAL

280
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,235
SESSIONS, I HATE TO INTERRUPT.

281
00:08:11,235 --> 00:08:12,236
SOME OF THESE DOCUMENTS END UP

282
00:08:12,236 --> 00:08:13,670
SHOWING UP IN THE IG REPORT

283
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,239
CONGRESS' FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS

284
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:16,039
AGO.

285
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:16,607
YOU WERE IN CONGRESS.

286
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:18,108
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO TRY

287
00:08:18,108 --> 00:08:19,243
TO DO OVERSIGHT.

288
00:08:19,243 --> 00:08:20,277
IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING.

289
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:24,948
THEY ARE HOLD ROSENSTEIN IN

290
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:26,216
CONTEMPT.

291
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:26,583
THEN WHAT?

292
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,086
>> WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO

293
00:08:29,086 --> 00:08:30,020
RESPOND TO CONGRESS.

294
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,422
WE INTEND TO BE RESPONSIVE TO

295
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:33,222
CONGRESS.

296
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,826
IF WE ARE RUNNING BEHIND IN

297
00:08:35,826 --> 00:08:36,592
PRODUCTION, WILL TAKE EFFORTS TO

298
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:39,395
STEP IT UP.

299
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:43,933
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO

300
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:48,705
PRODUCE THE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE

301
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:49,406
PROPERLY DISCLOSED BULL AND WE

302
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:49,873
INTEND TO DO SO.

303
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:50,507
THAT'S MY DIRECTION TO THE

304
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:50,908
DEPARTMENT.

305
00:08:50,908 --> 00:08:52,009
>> SENATOR SESSIONS, ATTORNEY

306
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,443
GENERAL SESSIONS, ONE MORE

307
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:53,810
QUESTION.

308
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,612
ARE YOU INVOLVED AT ALL IN

309
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:57,381
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT A POSSIBLE

310
00:08:57,381 --> 00:09:00,217
RECUSAL OF ROD ROSENSTEIN OF

311
00:09:00,217 --> 00:09:02,719
MUELLER, GIVEN THE FACT THAT HE

312
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,453
SIGNED UP FISA WARRANT.

313
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:05,422
IT'S A BIG CONTROVERSY IN THIS

314
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:05,822
CASE.

315
00:09:05,822 --> 00:09:08,825
>> I'M NOT INVOLVED IN THAT.

316
00:09:08,825 --> 00:09:10,227
HE IS THE ACTING ATTORNEY

317
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:11,995
GENERAL FOR THAT MATTER, AND HE

318
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:14,131
HAS TO MAKE HIS OWN DECISION, AS

319
00:09:14,131 --> 00:00:00,000
I HAD TO MAKE MY DECISION.
