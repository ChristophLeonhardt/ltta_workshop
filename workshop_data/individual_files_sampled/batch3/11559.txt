French president has concluded a three-day trip to Washington by addressing the US Congress where he got a warm welcome from lawmakers the president of the French Republic after that Emmanuel macron spoke enthusiastically of the special bond between the two countries in a lengthy speech and with historical references France has participated in the story of this great nation from the very beginning for a moment transport ourselves to the past French philosopher Voltaire and Benjamin Franklin George Washington's son of America and France laughs I get some of the United States Parham Lincoln Simone de Beauvoir Martin Luther King President Sheridan results from Thomas Jefferson to Hemingway's novel to fortunes novels possesses this very special relationship the scissors along with all of those historical references there was some policy discussed most importantly the Iran deal now the media has portrayed at Trump and microns relationship as a bromance so to speak and comparing it to the infamous Bush Blair bromance of the early 2000s but that definitely could be a mischaracterization considering that Makran took some positions that were totally out of line with Trump's policies including expressing support for the Paris climate agreement using the phrase make the planet great again which is in stark contrast to Trump's make America great again slogan but Makran it that didn't seem to be Mac Ron's position he was a bit more ambiguous regarding the jcpoa earlier but at this time he did call for a more comprehensive deal while reiterating that France wouldn't be abandoning the agreement but that wasn't his a position on Tuesday when he met with Trump Brazil moi for a number of months I've been saying that it was not a sufficient deal it will enable us at least until 2025 to have some control over their nuclear activities Lee we therefore wish to work on a new deal with Iran we signed it at the initiative of the United States we signed it boss the United States and France that is why we cannot say we should get rid of it like that France will not leave the jcpoa because we sign it again Mac Ron did clarify that the necessity of the agreement outweighs Washington's concerns and he urged other signatories to stick with the deal until there's a better one now Trump argues the opposite but Makran and Trump reaching consensus came as somewhat of a surprise to the other signatories especially considering that 500 French British and German MPs wrote a letter to US Congress asking them to support the deal saying that the concerns should be addressed separately and not within the context of the jcpoa this is crucial because it's in direct conflict with Mac Ron's view so got what the EU and Russia had to say about it when what can happen in the future we'll see in the future but there is one deal existing it's working it needs to be preserved we're against the revision of these agreements and believe it's very counterproductive to derail the long-standing international efforts we'll make sure that these agreements enshrined in the UN Security Council resolution won't be violated Trump has until May 12th to decide what he's going to do but now that there seems to be some division amongst the members of the EU it's impossible to predict what exactly will happen Samira Khan reporting from Washington as for how all this looks from Tehran political analyst Saeed Mustafa kesheshian told me that although France in America might be aligning on the Iran deal now the rest of Europe does not want to shift the trio nations in Europe especially France even more than Germany and Britain is trying to get closer to Donald Trump's aspirations and demands especially with regard to Iran's nuclear issue but the rest of Europe is standing against any intensification of you know problems and tensions with Tehran they just rejected a demand by the trio European nations with regard to imposing further sanctions on Iran for its missile and regional activities so this shows that Europe is not much willing to you know work with Donald Trump
