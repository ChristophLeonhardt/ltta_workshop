news out of Miami and a completely different subject where a portion of a new pedestrian bridge no the campus of Florida International University has collapsed it looks pretty serious let's go right to our local affiliate WTVJ and listen in on their four or five vehicles clearly at least five vehicles we have seen under that collapsed bridge and some of them in a situation where it would be difficult for them to get out we can hope that they survived and that they'll be able to be rescued and that they're not seriously injured but right now it's just it's just a hope we don't know exactly what they have out there and neither do they and and that's why they are responding as they are southwest a street in 109 two near the turnpike there at the FIU campus a place right now that is closed for spring break at least so there weren't a lot of students around the bridge itself was not open yet it had just been erected Saturday the major portion of it and it came down today and this was being touted as a bridge for safety both in construction and for pedestrian safety you know miami-dade County does have an urban rescue team and these are people who train for building collapses and I don't know whether those individuals are part of that team but I've seen people on a team like that in action before and that is how they go and go into a scene you know they they are trying to get in as quickly as they can to save lives to protect the people who are trapped under there and Andrea I don't know if you're able to see that from your vantage point but are you seeing more activity there now have that frame maneuver somehow around the other vehicles that are out here at the seat right now but it's really not clear if they're even going to try to bring their solution to the bridge or they're just trying to move it around to open up a way for more fire as an to arrive for more ambulances but it does look that they're actually trying to clear the way and get closer to this bridge but right now it's only they're actually moving us even further and further away from the scene right now I am at least one block away on 192 public servants and they keep expanding the perimeters postings are yellow state passed the several blocks around the area us again if they are time to somehow get closer to the bridge and help the people don't have to stop there right now yeah and we can tell you that we are getting information now from the Florida Highway Patrol as we feared looking at those pictures we can tell you sadly that there are fatalities they have confirmed there are deaths related to this collapse hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
