WE KICK OFF TODAY'S EDITION WAS

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,254
SOMETHING SO RIDICULOUS THAT IT

7
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:24,456
HAS TO BE SEEN TO BELIEVED.

8
00:00:24,456 --> 00:00:27,392
THIS IS A CANDIDATE FOR CONGRESS

9
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,261

00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:48,046
REGARD TO SCHOOL SAFETY.

18
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:49,548
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WOULD

19
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:51,450
LIKE TO ARM TEACHERS.

20
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,051
TILLMAN HAS A DIFFERENT APPROACH

21
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:55,053
AND HE DEMONSTRATES IT.

22
00:00:55,053 --> 00:00:57,656
>> AND POWER SCHOOLS AND

TRUST ME, THIS.

27
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:04,429
ANYONE.

28
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:14,006
IN THEIR TRACKS.

29
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:21,847
NOW I JUST CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

30
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:24,016
FOR LESS THAN $1 PER PERSON IN

31
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:25,317
THE U.S., WE CAN HAVE A SECURE

32
00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:27,619
CANISTER OF PEPPER SPRAY IN

33
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:30,656
EVERY CLASSROOM IN AMERICA.

34
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:31,990
IT'S UNBEARABLE, IT'S LIKE A

35
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:36,195
LULLABY YOUR EYES.

36
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:37,930
>> THE AD IS LIKE A LULLABY IN

37
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,298
EYES.

38
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:42,134
>> THANK GOD HE IS NOT A WILD

39
00:01:42,134 --> 00:01:42,568
GAME ADVOCATE.

40
00:01:42,568 --> 00:01:44,636
HE WOULD BE SETTING OFF BEAR

41
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:46,205
TRAPS AND BLEEDING ALL OVER THE

42
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:46,505
FLOOR.

43
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:47,873
>> Laura: HE LOOKS LIKE HE IS

44
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:50,008
WATERBOARDING HIMSELF.

45
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:51,043
IN THE END I WANTED TO SPRAY

46
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:52,911
MYSELF WITH PEPPER SPRAY SO I

47
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:54,146
DIDN'T HAVE TO WATCH.

48
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:55,314
>> HE COULD HAVE A NEW SHOW

49
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:59,418
CALLED THE CANDIDATES AGAINST

50
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:00,452
THE WORLD.

51
00:02:00,452 --> 00:02:02,387
HE COULD BREATHE IN CARBON

52
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:04,857
MONOXIDE, DRINK TOILET WATER --

53
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:06,825
>> Laura: AND THERE IS A

54
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:07,860
CERTAIN TYPE OF BLACK SPIDER

55
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,228
THAT'S ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES

56
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:14,366
SO I'M LIVING WITH HIM.

57
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:16,768
AND, HE'S A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE

58
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:20,439
FOR A HOUSE SEAT IN COLORADO.

59
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,006
>> Laura: DISTURBING.

60
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:25,244
SO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE

61
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:32,551
BISHOP OF TUCSON?

62
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:35,020
AT ONE POINT, THE BISHOP OF

63
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,256
TUCSON, ARIZONA, AS YOU

64
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:38,257
MENTIONED, EDWARD WEISS AND

65
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:39,458
BERGER SEEM TO MORALLY EQUATE

66
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,828
THOSE ENFORCING THE BORDER WITH

67
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:45,230
PEOPLE COMMITTING ABORTIONS.

68
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,565
SPEAKING ABOUT BORDER SECURITY

69
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:49,401
THAT TAKES THE PART IN

70
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:50,269
SEPARATING FAMILIES.

71
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:50,569
WATCH.

72
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:52,071
>> IN LIGHT OF THE PENALTIES

73
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,073
THAT ARE THERE FOR LIFE ISSUES,

74
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,842
I'M SIMPLY ASKING THE QUESTION

75
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:58,877
IF PERHAPS OUR AFFAIRS COMMITTEE

76
00:02:58,877 --> 00:03:00,079
COULD GIVE RECOMMENDATIONS TO

77
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,115
THOSE OF US WHO ARE BORDER

78
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:05,484
BISHOPS ON THE POSSIBILITY OF

79
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:06,652
CANONICAL PENALTIES FOR

80
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:08,354
CATHOLICS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN

81
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:08,854
THIS.

82
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:10,522
FOR THE SALVATION OF THESE

83
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:11,056
PEOPLE'S SOULS.

84
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:15,661
MAYBE IT IS TIME FOR US TO LOOK

85
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:16,261
AT CANONICAL PENALTIES.

86
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:18,063
>> MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO

87
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:20,499
READ A CANON LAW.

88
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:22,034
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

89
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:24,370
>> CANONICAL PENALTIES MEAN

90
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,041
RESCINDING THE SACRAMENTS.

91
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,343
I GOT A CALL FROM SOME BORDER

92
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:32,378
SECURITY GUYS.

93
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,514
I SAID WHEN NANCY PELOSI GETS

00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:36,716
THE LETTER OF RESIGNATION YOU

95
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,483

108
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,258
WITH POLICIES THAT DON'T

109
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:48,661
INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO SEND THEIR

110
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,197
CHILDREN ALONE ACROSS THE BORDER

111
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:51,797
CHILDREN ALONE ACROSS THE BORDE

112
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:52,131
BORDER.

113
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,867
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW.

114
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,736
AND THAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR

115
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,371
HOME COUNTRY AND HERE.

116
00:03:59,371 --> 00:04:00,673
>> AND ORDERLY.

117
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,275
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DOES GOD LOOK

118
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:03,843
LIKE?

119
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,412
60 SECONDS.

120
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,080
>> THE UNIVERSITY OF

121
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,249
NORTH CAROLINA DID A STUDY, FIVE

122
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,050
YEARS AND 11 AMERICANS.

123
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,485
THIS IS WHAT THEY THINK GOD

124
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,787
LOOKS LIKE.

125
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,422
>>  >> Laura: THAT LOOKS LIKE OE

126
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,457
OF THE GUYS IN THE CONTROL ROOM

127
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:19,625
IN NEW YORK.

128
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,027
>> IT'S NICK ROBERTSON, HE IS

129
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:24,997
BASICALLY A NICE WHITE GUY.

130
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:25,264
NO.

131
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,098
PEOPLE TEND TO PROJECT THEIR

132
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:27,433
IMAGE AND THEIR BELIEFS ONTO

133
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,667
THEIR IMAGE OF GOD.

134
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,337
SO I THOUGHT, I WOULD WE DEFINE

135
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:31,670
GOD?

136
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,707
SO I CAME UP WITH MY OWN IMAGES.

137
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:38,844
HERE IS WHAT I THINK.

138
00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:41,247
FRANK SINATRA AND JOHN HOUSTON

139
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:47,052
IN THE GREATEST STORY.

140
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:53,092
NOW YOUR PICKS.

141
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:56,328
>> Laura: MY PICKS ARE

142
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:58,230
CHARLTON HESTON -- THAT SEEMS

143
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,931
LIKE GOD.

144
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,267
GOD CAN'T LOOK LIKE THE KID IN

145
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:04,870
THE APPLE COMMERCIAL, LIKE

146
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,437
MACINTOSH VERSUS PC.

147
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:08,440
THAT'S LIKE A MILLENNIAL THING.

148
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,643
LIKE GOD HAS SKINNY JEANS, A MAN

149
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,746
BUN AND HE IS ALSO A BOY.

150
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:17,116
>> WE WANT A GUY WITH SOME

151
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,517
AUTHORITY AND GRAVITAS BUT I

152
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:21,353
THINK WE CAN AGREE THAT GOD DOES

153
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:22,621
NOT LOOK LIKE THIS.

154
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:24,723
>> Laura: THESE TWO.

155
00:05:24,723 --> 00:05:26,859
I NEVER BOUGHT EITHER ONE OF

156
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:27,660
THOSE.

157
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,830
>> YOU WANT GOD TO SOUND LIKE

158
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,064
HIM.

159
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:33,699
>> GEORGE BURNS WAS HILARIOUS.

160
00:05:33,699 --> 00:00:00,000
>> WE DON'T WANT GOD TO SOUND
