You get into those situations
where you can't necessarily
use deadly force and you need
some kind of alternative.
And the dog plays that role and
he does it very well.
We can deploy that dog and
apprehend a suspect and give
that individual time to
surrender and it keeps
our team safe at the same time.
This exercise here is called the
crash intercept. All this is
This exercise here is called the
crash intercept all this is
intended to do is stop the
forward progression of a
possible assailant.
You can see some of
the recruits are standing in

the recruits are standing in

What they're trying to do is

Just being that human
speed bump.
We're trying to teach the
recruits that you actually have

In order for them to graduate
they do have to pass our
physical standards.
The test is a combination of pushups, sit
ups, chin ups and a mile and a half run.
And it's just based on gender and
age how they need to perform.
And it's a point system
so they need to
achieve enough points
in order to graduate.
There's a bunch of things
we're looking for here.
Can they deliver that accurate
shot from a distance?
Are they aware of their backdrop?
Whether they're on a protective
assignment in L.A. with the

to be cautious about our backdrops.
Once they get into a good position,
are they taking up cover?
Can they get to a position,
know what they have downrange and
then work around certain obstacles?
They're shooting. They're moving.
So there's a very dynamic course here.
What we're trying to teach
today is maneuvering,
precision and maneuvering curves.
Those individuals going through
that process are learning the techniques
that we want for our limo
drivers for the president
and the vice president and
those operational details.
