EARLY ON, IN A VERY REAL SENSE, 
WE INHERITED A CYBER CRISIS. 
THE LAST ADMINISTRATION ALL BUT 
NEGLECT DID CYBER SECURITY COME 
EVEN THOUGH THE DIGITAL THREATS 
WERE GROWING MORE NUMEROUS AND 
MORE DANGEROUS BY THE DAY. 
IN 2014, A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT 
ACTUALLY HACKED INTO THE WHITE 
HOUSE NETWORK ITSELF, AND YET, 
IN THE FACE OF CONSTANT ATTACKS 
LIKE THAT, THE LAST 
ADMINISTRATION TOO OFTEN CHOSE 
A SILENCE AND PARALYSIS OF 
RESTRAINT AND ACTION. 
MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. 
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. 
AT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DIRECTION, 
OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN 
DECISIVE ACTION TO FORTIFY 
AMERICA'S CYBER SECURITY 
CAPABILITIES. WE ARE ALSO 
FORGING NEW PARTNERSHIPS, 
EVIDENCED BY THIS CONFERENCE 
TODAY, ALL ACROSS OUR SOCIETY. 
ALSO WITH STATE AND LOCAL 
GOVERNMENTS. 
AND WITH GREAT CORPORATIONS. 
SO WELL REPRESENTED HERE. 
WE HAVE SECURED VITAL NEW 
FUNDING FOR CYBER SECURITY. 
IN OUR FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE, WE 
ALLOCATED AN ADDITIONAL $1.2 
MILLION FOR DIGITAL DEFENSE AND 
NEXT YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION 
HAS REQUESTED A RECORD $15 
BILLION TO SECURE AMERICA'S 
CYBER FRONTIERS. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH 
CONGRESS. 
TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES THAT 
WE NEED TO DEFEND OUR NATION 
FROM THE THREATS WE FACE IN THE 
DIGITAL DOMAIN. BUT THIS 
CRITICAL ISSUE REQUIRES MORE 
THAN NEW FUNDING. AMERICA ALSO 
NEEDS A CENTRAL HUB FOR CYBER 
SECURITY, AND TODAY, WE CALL ON 
THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO 
FOLLOW THE LEAD OF THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES AND BEFORE THE 
END OF THIS YEAR AND ACT 
LEGISLATION TO CREATE A NEW 
AGENCY UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF 
DHS. 
THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE CYBER 
SECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
SECURITY AGES TO COMMENCE. 
THANK YOU. 
>> 
>> THIS AGENCY WILL BRING 
TOGETHER THE RESOURCES OF THE 
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO FOCUS ON 
CYBER SECURITY, AND IT IS AN 
IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME. 
IN ADDITION TO FUNDING AND 
REFORMS, OUR ADMINISTRATION IS 
HARDENING FEDERAL NETWORKS AS 
NEVER BEFORE. 
WE ARE TAKING RENEWED ACTION TO 
IDENTIFY AND ELIMINATE 
WEAKNESSES THAT ARE PEACE OUR 
ADVERSARIES COULD EXPLOIT. 
FOR EXAMPLE, THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT HAS LONG ALLOWED A 
RUSSIAN ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE TO 
BE INSTALLED ON FEDERAL 
DEVICES, EVEN THOUGH IT HAS A 
DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AND 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES. 
THIS THREAT EXISTED FOR MANY 
YEARS, BUT OUR ADMINISTRATION 
ENDED THE THREAT LAST YEAR WHEN 
WE BANNED  THE SOFTWARE FROM 
THE ENTIRE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. 
>>  
>> WE HAVE ALSO DRAMATICALLY 
INCREASED INFORMATION SHARING 
WITH INNOVATORS, DEVELOPERS, 
AND NETWORKED OFFENDERS. 
AMERICA'S INTELLIGENCE AND LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE AN 
UNPARALLELED ABILITY TO 
DISCOVER WEAKNESSES IN DIGITAL 
PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE. 
WHILE THE LAST ADMINISTRATIONS 
ALMOST ALWAYS HELD ONTO THIS 
ADMINISTRATION IN THIS WHITE 
HOUSE, I AM PROUD TO REPORT 
THAT WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY 
IMPROVED HOW MUCH WE SHARE WITH 
THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE 
SPEED WITH WHICH WE SHARE IT. 
TODAY, NEARLY A THIRD OF THE 
THREAT INDICATORS THAT WE SHARE 
WITH BUSINESSES ARE NOT 
AVAILABLE FROM ANY OTHER 
SOURCE. 
WE WILL CONTINUE ON THAT TRACK. 
FINALLY, OUR ADMINISTRATION IS 
PUTTING THE FINISHING TOUCHES 
ON OUR NATIONAL CYBER STRATEGY. 
THIS STRATEGY WILL MAKE CLEAR 
THAT THE UNITED STATES WILL 
BRING EVERY ELEMENT OF OUR 
NATIONAL POWER TO BEAR TO 
PROTECT THE INTEGRITY AND 
SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN 
DIGITAL DOMAIN. 
>>  
>> OUR ACTIONS HAVE ALREADY 
MADE OUR ADVERSARIES ACTIONS 
MORE COSTLY. 
AS WE CONTINUE TO REINFORCE OUR 
CYBER DEFENSES, WE WILL DETER 
THEM AS NEVER BEFORE. 
AS YOU WELL KNOW, WE CANNOT 
PREVENT EVERY ASSAULT. 
-- EVERY ASSAULT OR ATTACK IN 
THE DIGITAL SPHERE. 
THE SHEER SIZE AND MAGNITUDE OF 
THE DANGER COMBINED WITH THE 
RAPID EVOLUTION MEANS ABOUT 
SOME ATTEMPTS WILL SIMPLY SLIP 
THROUGH THE CRACKS. 
BE ASSURED THAT OUR GOVERNMENT 
WILL CONTINUE TO ENSURE THE 
RESILIENCE OF OUR DIGITAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WHEN 
THESE BREACHES MAY OCCUR, WE 
CAN GET BACK ON OUR FEET FAST. 
WE CAN CHART A PATH FORWARD, 
LEARN FROM OUR VULNERABILITY 
AND PREVENT THE NEXT ATTACK. 
WHEN IT COMES TO STOPPING OUR 
CYBER ADVERSARIES, RESILIENCE, 
THOUGH, IS NOT ENOUGH. 
WE ALSO MUST BE PREPARED TO 
RESPOND, AND, IN THIS WHITE 
HOUSE, I AM PROUD TO REPORT, WE 
ARE. 
OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN 
ACTION TO ELEVATE THE UNITED 
STATES CYBER COMMAND TO A 
COMBAT AND COMMAND, PUTTING IT 
ON THE SAME LEVEL AS THE 
COMMANDS THAT OVERSEE OUR 
MILITARY OPERATINS AROUND THE 
WORLD. GONE ARE THE DAYS WHEN 
AMERICA ALLOWS OUR ADVERSARIES 
TO CYBER ATTACK US WITH 
IMPUNITY. 
OUR GOAL REMAINS, AMERICAN 
SECURITY WILL BE AS DOMINANT IN 
THE DIGITAL WORLD AS WE ARE IN 
THE PHYSICAL WORLD. 
>>  
>> FOR ALL THAT WE HAVE DONE 
AND FOR ALL THAT WE ARE DOING, 
THERE IS STILL MUCH MORE WORK. 
WHAT BRINGS US ALL HERE TODAY 
IS THE RECOGNITION THAT WE 
CANNOT DO IT ALONE. 
STRENGTHENING AMERICAN CYBER 
SECURITY DOES NOT BELONG SOLELY 
TO OUR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IN 
WASHINGTON D.C..  
úTHE GREATEST 
FROM THE BOTTOM UP, NOT FROM 
THE TOP DOWN, AND SO, BEYOND 
OUR GOVERNMENTWIDE APPROACH, WE 
NEED YOU. WE NEED YOU TO 
CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH US FOR 
A NATIONWIDE APPROACH, FOUR 
TOGETHER, WE CAN PROTECT 
AMERICA'S DIGITAL DOMAIN. 
>>  
>> IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT CYBER 
SECURITY IS A TEAM SPORT. 
IT REQUIRES SEAMLESS 
COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, STATE AND 
LOCAL LEADERS, BUT ALSO 
INNOVATORS, ENTREPRENEURS, 
ACADEMIC EXPERTS. 
IN A WORD, IT REQUIRES ALL OF 
YOU IN THIS ROOM. 
AND ALL OF THOSE THAT YOU 
REPRESENT, ALL ACROSS THE 
NATION. 
WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN IMPORTANT 
STEPS, I AM PLEASED TO REPORT, 
TO IMPROVE OUR PARTNERSHIPS AT 
EVERY LEVEL, AND IN ADDITION TO 
THIS CONFERENCE TODAY, WHERE 
YOU HAVE HEARD MUCH ABOUT THOSE 
EFFORTS, I AM PARTICULARLY 
EXCITED WITH THE NEW INITIATIVE 
THE SECRETARY NIELSEN ANNOUNCED 
THIS MORNING. 
THE NATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
CENTER. 
THIS NEW CENTER WILL BE THE 
GATEWAY FOR AMERICAN COMPANIES 
WHO WANT TO WORK WITH THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MORE CLOSELY 
TO STRENGTHEN OUR SHARED CYBER 
SECURITY, AND LET ME TAKE THIS 
MOMENT TO THANK ALL OF YOU WHO 
HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED YOUR 
INTENTION TO JOIN THIS RADICAL 
INITIATIVE. JUST A FEW WEEKS 
AGO, IN THE SITUATION ROOM, I 
PERSONALLY MET WITH THE 
PRESIDENT'S NATIONAL SECURITY 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS ADVISORY 
COMMITTEE, ALSO KNOWN -- WHICH 
BRINGS TOGETHER KEY INDUSTRY 
LEADERS TO DEVELOP 
RECOMMENDATIONS ON CYBER 
POLICY. 
I LEARNED THEN AND I WILL LEARN 
IN A FEW SHORT WEEKS THAT THEY 
WILL SOON LAUNCH A CYBER 
SECURITY MOONSHOT INITIATIVE TO 
FOCUS OUR NATIONAL ENERGIES AND 
SKILLS ON DIGITAL DOMINANCE. 
THOSE LEADERS THAT DAY INFORMED 
ME THAT AMERICA WON THE RACE TO 
THE MOON AND UNDER THIS 
ADMINISTRATION, IN PARTNERSHIP 
WITH ALL OF YOU, AMERICA WILL 
LEAD THE WAY TO CYBER SECURITY. 
AND STRENGTH. 
>>  
>> THE EXAMPLES THAT I 
MENTIONED TODAY ARE ALL 
ESSENTIAL TO THE SECURITY AND 
PROSPERITY OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE, BUT AS WE GATHER TODAY, 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALSO 
DESERVE TO KNOW THAT OUR 
DEMOCRACY IS SECURE AS WELL. 
BEFORE I CLOSE, LET ME SPEAK TO 
OUR ADMINISTRATION'S 
UNPRECEDENTED ACTION TO 
SAFEGUARD THE INTEGRITY OF OUR 
ELECTIONS. 
WHILE OTHER NATIONS CERTAINLY 
POSSESS THE CAPABILITY, THE 
FACT IS RUSSIA INTERFERED IN 
OUR 2016 ELECTION. 
THAT IS THE UNAMBIGUOUS 
JUDGMENT OF OUR INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY AND, AS THE PRESIDENT 
SAID, WE ACCEPT THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY'S 
CONCLUSION. 
RUSSIA'S GOAL WAS TO SOW DISCORD
AND TO WEAKEN THE AMERICANS -- 
AMERICAN PEOPLE'S FAITH IN OUR 
DEMOCRACY. 
WHILE NO ACTUAL VOTES WERE 
CHANGED, AND HE ATTEMPTED TO 
INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTIONS IS 
AN AFFRONT TO OUR DEMOCRACY AND 
IT WILL NOT BE ALLOWED. 
>>  
>> THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
WILL NOT TOLERATE ANY FOREIGN 
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS 
FROM ANY NATIONSTATE, NOT FROM 
RUSSIA, CHINA, IRAN, NORTH 
KOREA, OR ANYONE ELSE. 
AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, WE ARE 
NOT GOING TO HAVE IT. 
TO THAT END, OVER THE PAST YEAR,
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DIRECTED 
OUR ADMINISTRATION TO CREATE, 
AS WELL, A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT 
APPROACH TO STRENGTHEN ELECTION 
SECURITY. AS RECENTLY AS LAST 
WEEK, THE PRESIDENT CAN VETO 
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL 
MEETING FOR UPDATES ON THE 
PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE. AS 
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID, WE HAVE 
TAKEN A FIRM STANCE AND WE 
BACKED IT UP WITH STRONG 
ACTION. 
THE FBI HAS FORMED THE FOREIGN 
INFLUENCE TASK FORCE TO IDENTIFY
SECRET FOREIGN ATTEMPTS TO 
INFILTRATE OUR SOCIETY AND 
UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY HAS LAUNCHED THE 
ELECTION INFORMATION SHARING 
AND ANALYSIS CENTER. 
THIS PROJECT, WHICH ALL 50 
STATES AND MORE THAN 900 
COUNTIES HAVE ALREADY JOINED, 
WILL HELP PREVENT ATTACKS 
BEFORE THEY HAPPEN, IDENTIFY 
THEM WHEN THEY ARE UNDERWAY, 
AND STOP THEM BEFORE THEY CAN 
DO ANY LASTING DAMAGE. 
úWORKING 
HAVE ALSO MADE $380 MILLION 
AVAILABLE TO STATES TO HELP 
THEM ENSURE THE SECURITY OF 
THEIR ELECTION SYSTEMS. 
THAT INCLUDES UPGRADING VOTING 
MACHINES AND THE MOST UP TO 
DATE AND SECURE TECHNOLOGY. 
WE ARE DEPLOYING SENSORS TO 
MONITOR ELECTION NETWORKS AND 
IDENTIFY POTENTIAL INTRUSIONS 
AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. 
37 STATES HAVE OPTED INTO THIS 
PROGRAM, AND BEFORE THIS 
NOVEMBER, WE INTEND TO EXPAND 
THE FURTHER 22 STATES AND 
COUNTIES AS THEY REQUEST. 
OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO 
LAUNCHED A NATIONAL CYBER 
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS ROOM THAT 
OFFERS STATES A VIRTUAL 
CONNECTION BETWEEN DHS AND 
ELECTION OFFICES ON ELECTION 
DAY ITSELF. 
IN MY HOME STATE OF INDIANA, AS 
WELL AS OHIO, NORTH CAROLINA, 
AND WEST VIRGINIA, THIS SYSTEM 
WAS USED IN THE MAY 8 PRIMARY, 
AND WE ARE WORKING HARD TO 
EXPAND THIS PROJECT FOR OTHER 
STATES SO THAT IT IS READY 
BEFORE THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS IN 
NOVEMBER. 
WE HAVE ALSO BEEN WORKING TO 
HELP STATE AND LOCAL 
GOVERNMENTS RAPIDLY RESPOND TO 
CYBER ATTACKS. 
LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO, IN 
KANSAS, THEY REACHED OUT TO DHS 
FOR HELP AFTER A MALWARE ATTACK 
FORCED THEM TO SHUT DOWN NOT 
JUST THEIR ELECTION NETWORK BUT 
THE ENTIRE COUNTY NETWORK. 
FEDERAL OFFICIALS WORKED 
EARNESTLY, HAND-IN-HAND, WITH 
COUNTY OFFICIALS TO IDENTIFY 
AND ULTIMATELY ELIMINATE THIS 
DANGEROUS INTRUSION. 
THIS ACTION WAS A MODEL OF THE 
COLLABORATION THAT WE NEEDED TO 
ENSURE THE SECURITY OF OUR 
ELECTIONS, AND WE COMMANDED THE 
STATE AND LOCAL AND FEDERAL 
OFFICIALS THAT MADE IT HAPPEN. 
>>  
>> MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. 
OUR ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES 
THAT ELECTIONS ARE ADMINISTERED 
AND CONDUCTED AT THE STATE AND 
LOCAL LEVEL. 
THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY 
BEEN A CHAMPION OF FEDERALISM. 
IN RESPECT TO THE PURVIEW AND 
AUTHORITY OF OUR STATE AND 
LOCAL OFFICIALS. 
YET IT CONCERNS US THAT MANY 
STATES STILL DO NOT HAVE 
CONCRETE PLANS TO UPDATE THEIR 
VOTING SYSTEMS. 
14 STATES ARE STRUGGLING TO 
REPLACE OUTDATED VOTING 
MACHINES THAT LACK PAPER TRAILS 
BEFORE THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION, SO TODAY, NOT JUST AS 
VICE PRESIDENT, BUT AS A FORMER 
GOVERNOR, I WANT TO URGE WITH 
GREAT RESPECT EVERY STATE TO 
TAKE RENEWED ACTION. TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF THE ASSISTANCE 
OFFERED BY OUR ADMINISTRATION. 
DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER TO 
STRENGTHEN AND PROTECT YOUR 
ELECTION SYSTEMS. 
YOU OWE YOUR CONSTITUENTS THAT 
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EXPECT 
NOTHING LESS. 
>>  
>> THIS IS A TIME FOR VIGILANCE 
AND RESOLVE. 
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT OUR 
ADMINISTRATION WILL CONTINUE TO 
TAKE STRONG ACTION. 
WE HAVE ALREADY DONE MORE THAN 
ANY ADMINISTRATION IN AMERICAN 
HISTORY TO PRESERVE THE 
INTEGRITY OF THE BALLOT BOX AND 
WE HAVE JUST BEGUN. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK 
TIRELESSLY TO PREVENT FOREIGN 
NATIONS AND MALIGN ACTORS FROM 
HACKING INTO OUR ELECTION 
INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE 
POTENTIAL OF CHANGING VOTES OR 
ELECTION OUTCOMES. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT WE 
WILL REPEL ANY EFFORTS TO 
INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTIONS. 
WHEN ANYONE VIOLATES OUR LAWS, 
WE WILL BRING THEM TO JUSTICE 
AND UTILIZE EVERY ELEMENT OF 
OUR NATIONAL POWER TO RESPOND 
BECAUSE OUR DEMOCRACY DEMANDS 
AND DESERVES THE MOST VIGOROUS 
DEFENSE WE CAN GIVE IT. 
>>  
>>> I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT 
WE WILL DO THIS IN A MANNER 
THAT RESPECTS THE GOD-GIVEN 
LIBERTIES ENSHRINE IN OUR 
CONSTITUTION, INCLUDING THE 
FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND THE 
FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. 
WE WILL NEVER STIFLE VOICES IN 
A FREE SOCIETY. 
BUT WE CAN EXPOSE MALIGN AND 
FRAUDULENT VOICES WHEN THEY 
SEEK TO UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN 
OUR DEMOCRACY, AND THIS WE WILL 
DO. 
OUR ADMINISTRATION WILL ALWAYS 
MAKE EFFORTS TO SHED LIGHT ON 
FOREIGN ATTEMPTS TO INTERFERE 
OR SO MALIGN INFLUENCE IN OUR 
ELECTIONS AND OUR SOCIETY. 
OUR 16th PRESIDENT, ABRAHAM 
LINCOLN, PROBABLY SAID IT BEST 
WHEN HE SAID GIVE THE PEOPLE 
THE FACTS AND THE REPUBLIC WILL 
BE SAVED. 
WHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE 
THE FACTS, THEY ALWAYS UPHOLD 
OUR MOST CHERISHED INSTITUTIONS 
AND VALUES, AND THIS IS JUST AS 
TRUE TODAY AS IT HAS EVER BEEN 
IN OUR NATION'S LONG AND 
STORIED HISTORY. 
SO THANK YOU, AGAIN, FOR BEING 
HERE. 
BEING A PART OF THIS IMPORTANT 
AND HISTORIC GATHERING. 
>> YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE IS 
SPEAKING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF 
HOMELAND SECURITY NATIONAL 
CYBER SECURITY SUMMIT. 
HE DEFENDED THE DONALD TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS TO 
PROTECT THE COUNTRY FROM CYBER 
THREATS, POINTING OUT ABOUT 
CYBER COMMAND IS NOW ELEVATED 
TO THE LEVEL OF COMBATANTS 
COMPANY -- COMMAND IN THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. 
HE ALSO SAID THAT RUSSIA 
UNDOUBTEDLY INTERFERED IN THE 
2016 ELECTIONS, SAYING THAT 
THAT IS THE CONCLUSION OF THE 
U.S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND 
WE ACCEPT THAT DETERMINATION 
PICK THERE IS MUCH MORE NEWS 
THIS IS CBSN . STAY WITH US.
