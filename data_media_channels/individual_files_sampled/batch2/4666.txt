I want to get you caught up because there is a lot of questions about the president's executive order this morning and was it just well was it out starting with what exactly did it mandate for one it continues to trump administration's zero-tolerance policy to criminally prosecute people who cross the border illegally second it states that it is now the policy of the Trump administration to keep parents and their kids together as adults wait their court hearing third it calls on other government agencies including the Pentagon to make available existing facilities or construct new ones to house these families so when is all of this gonna happen there's no clear answer during the White House briefing on Wednesday the counselor to attorney general Jeff sessions said an implementation phase would happen but had no additional details and what about the 2300 kids who have already been separated from their parents currently at shelters in 17 states well there's no current plan to reunify them and a spokesperson for the Health and Human Services Department says the agency is waiting for further guidance on the matter so with an executive order even necessary in the first place the answer is no the New York Times puts it this way quote mr. Trump liked the flourish of signing executive orders in front of cameras but most of his executive orders have amounted to asking the administration to conduct reviews and come up with proposed solutions to problems or they've consisted of directives that he could have made with a phone call this is one of those orders the government is now trying to answer this question where are the girls NBC White House reporter Kristen Welker asked that question to Homeland Security Secretary Kirsten Nelson Nielsen who said she'd get back to her now HHS has released images and video that they say was taken at a shelter in Homestead Florida showing both boys and girls prior to today we had only seen images of boys the government also released video that it says was taken at a shelter in Virginia there is no official word yet on whether Porter's might be able to tour those facilities hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
