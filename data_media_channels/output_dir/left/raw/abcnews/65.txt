20
02:10:36,761 --> 02:10:37,796
MESSAGE ON NORTH KOREA, URGING 

21
02:10:37,796 --> 02:10:39,665
THE WORLD TO ISOLATE NORTH KOREA

22
02:10:39,665 --> 02:10:42,301

23
02:10:42,301 --> 02:10:46,505
A MILITARY OPTION IF DIPLOMACY 

24
02:10:46,505 --> 02:10:46,738

ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM AS 

28
02:10:50,742 --> 02:10:51,176
WELL.

29
02:10:51,176 --> 02:10:55,413
HE'S THREATENING TO PULL OUT OF 

30
02:10:55,413 --> 02:10:55,780

AND DISTINGUISHED DELEGATES, 

35
02:11:09,561 --> 02:11:11,063
WELCOME TO NEW YORK.

36
02:11:11,063 --> 02:11:12,864
IT IS A PROFOUND HONOR TO STAND 

37
02:11:12,864 --> 02:11:16,134
HERE IN MY HOME CITY AS A 

38
02:11:16,134 --> 02:11:18,670
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AMERICAN 

39
02:11:18,670 --> 02:11:22,640
PEOPLE TO ADDRESS THE PEOPLE OF 

40
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:23,608
THE WORLD.

41
02:11:23,608 --> 02:11:24,676
AS MILLIONS OF OUR CITIZENS 

42
02:11:24,676 --> 02:11:26,777
CONTINUE TO SUFFER THE EFFECTS 

43
02:11:26,777 --> 02:11:30,816
OF THE DEVASTATING HURRICANES 

44
02:11:30,816 --> 02:11:32,384
THAT HAVE STRUCK OUR COUNTRY, I 

45
02:11:32,384 --> 02:11:34,252
WANT TO BEGIN BY EXPRESSING MY 

46
02:11:34,252 --> 02:11:36,388
APPRECIATION TO EVERY LEADER IN 

47
02:11:36,388 --> 02:11:39,391
THIS ROOM WHO HAS OFFERED 

48
02:11:39,391 --> 02:11:41,093
ASSISTANCE AND AID.

49
02:11:41,093 --> 02:11:42,494
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE STRONG 

50
02:11:42,494 --> 02:11:44,396
AND RESILIENT, AND THEY WILL 

51
02:11:44,396 --> 02:11:46,531
EMERGE FROM THESE HARDSHIPS MORE

52
02:11:46,531 --> 02:11:50,268
DETERMINED THAN EVER BEFORE.

53
02:11:50,268 --> 02:11:53,105
FORTUNATELY THE UNITED STATES 

54
02:11:53,105 --> 02:11:54,973
HAS DONE VERY WELL SINCE 

55
02:11:54,973 --> 02:11:58,744
ELECTION DAY LAST NOVEMBER 8th.

56
02:11:58,744 --> 02:12:00,946
THE STOCK MARKET IS AT AN 

57
02:12:00,946 --> 02:12:04,249
ALL-TIME HIGH, A RECORD.

58
02:12:04,249 --> 02:12:05,817
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT ITS LOWEST 

59
02:12:05,817 --> 02:12:08,319
LEVEL IN 16 YEARS, AND BECAUSE 

60
02:12:08,319 --> 02:12:11,022
OF OUR REGULATORY AND OTHER 

61
02:12:11,022 --> 02:12:13,391
REFORMS, WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE 

62
02:12:13,391 --> 02:12:14,826
WORKING IN THE UNITED STATES 

63
02:12:14,826 --> 02:12:18,096
TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE.

64
02:12:18,096 --> 02:12:20,732
COMPANIES ARE MOVING BACK, 

65
02:12:20,732 --> 02:12:22,934
CREATING JOB GROWTH THE LIKES OF

66
02:12:22,934 --> 02:12:24,636
WHICH OUR COUNTRY HAS NOT SEEN 

67
02:12:24,636 --> 02:12:28,173
IN A VERY LONG TIME, AND IT HAS 

68
02:12:28,173 --> 02:12:30,942
JUST BEEN ANNOUNCED THAT WE WILL

69
02:12:30,942 --> 02:12:33,278
BE SPENDING ALMOST $700 BILLION 

70
02:12:33,278 --> 02:12:36,815
ON OUR MILITARY AND DEFENSE.

71
02:12:36,815 --> 02:12:39,851
OUR MILITARY WILL SOON BE THE 

72
02:12:39,851 --> 02:12:46,992
STRONGEST IT HAS EVER BEEN.

73
02:12:46,992 --> 02:12:48,393
FOR MORE THAN 70 YEARS IN TIMES 

74
02:12:48,393 --> 02:12:50,862
OF WAR AND PEACE, THE LEADERS OF

75
02:12:50,862 --> 02:12:53,698
NATIONS, MOVEMENTS AND RELIGIONS

76
02:12:53,698 --> 02:12:55,233
HAVE STOOD BEFORE THIS ASSEMBLY.

77
02:12:55,233 --> 02:12:57,302
LIKE THEM I INTEND TO ADDRESS 

78
02:12:57,302 --> 02:12:59,071
SOME OF THE VERY SERIOUS THREATS

79
02:12:59,071 --> 02:13:01,840
BEFORE US TODAY, BUT ALSO THE 

80
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:05,243
ENORMOUS POTENTIAL WAITING TO BE

81
02:13:05,243 --> 02:13:05,510
UNLEASHED.

82
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:09,981
WE LIVE IN A TIME OF 

83
02:13:09,981 --> 02:13:11,783
EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY.

84
02:13:11,783 --> 02:13:12,984
BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE, 

85
02:13:12,984 --> 02:13:15,353
TECHNOLOGY, AND MEDICINE ARE 

86
02:13:15,353 --> 02:13:17,889
CURING ILLNESSES AND SOLVING 

87
02:13:17,889 --> 02:13:19,791
PROBLEMS THAT PRIOR GENERATIONS 

88
02:13:19,791 --> 02:13:22,661
THOUGHT IMPOSSIBLE TO SOLVE.

89
02:13:22,661 --> 02:13:25,764
BUT EACH DAY ALSO BRINGS NEWS OF

90
02:13:25,764 --> 02:13:27,966
GROWING DANGERS THAT THREATEN 

91
02:13:27,966 --> 02:13:32,604
EVERYTHING WE CHERISH AND VALUE.

92
02:13:32,604 --> 02:13:34,639
TERRORISTS AND EXTREMISTS HAVE 

93
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:36,307
GATHERED STRENGTH AND SPREAD TO 

94
02:13:36,307 --> 02:13:39,177
EVERY REGION OF THE PLANET.

95
02:13:39,177 --> 02:13:40,879
ROGUE REGIMES REPRESENTED IN 

96
02:13:40,879 --> 02:13:44,015
THIS BODY NOT ONLY SUPPORT 

97
02:13:44,015 --> 02:13:46,084
TERRORISTS BUT THREATEN OTHER 

98
02:13:46,084 --> 02:13:47,952
NATIONS AND THEIR OWN PEOPLE 

99
02:13:47,952 --> 02:13:49,688
WITH THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE 

100
02:13:49,688 --> 02:13:55,760
WEAPONS KNOWN TO HUMANITY.

101
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:58,062
AUTHORITY AND AUTHORITARIAN 

102
02:13:58,062 --> 02:14:00,465
POWERS SEEK TO COLLAPSE THE 

103
02:14:00,465 --> 02:14:04,435
VALUES, THE SYSTEMS, AND 

104
02:14:04,435 --> 02:14:05,403
ALLIANCES THAT PREVENTED 

105
02:14:05,403 --> 02:14:08,306
CONFLICT AND TILTED THE WORLD 

106
02:14:08,306 --> 02:14:12,677
TOWARD FREEDOM SINCE WORLD WAR 

107
02:14:12,677 --> 02:14:14,246
II.

108
02:14:14,246 --> 02:14:15,547
INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL NETWORKS 

109
02:14:15,547 --> 02:14:17,549
TRAFFIC DRUGS, WEAPONS, PEOPLE, 

110
02:14:17,549 --> 02:14:20,051
FORCE DISLOCATION AND MASS 

111
02:14:20,051 --> 02:14:22,854
MIGRATION, THREATEN OUR BORDERS,

112
02:14:22,854 --> 02:14:25,623
AND NEW FORMS OF AGGRESSION 

113
02:14:25,623 --> 02:14:29,060
EXPLOIT TECHNOLOGY TO MENACE OUR

114
02:14:29,060 --> 02:14:29,494
CITIZENS.

115
02:14:29,494 --> 02:14:32,964
TO PUT IT SIMPLY, WE MEET AT A 

116
02:14:32,964 --> 02:14:36,734
TIME OF BOTH IMMENSE PROMISE AND

117
02:14:36,734 --> 02:14:37,602
GREAT PERIL.

118
02:14:37,602 --> 02:14:39,237
IT IS ENTIRELY UP TO US WHETHER 

119
02:14:39,237 --> 02:14:41,306
WE LIFT THE WORLD TO NEW HEIGHTS

120
02:14:41,306 --> 02:14:47,778
OR LET IT FALL INTO A VALLEY OF 

121
02:14:47,778 --> 02:14:48,045
DISREPAIR.

122
02:14:48,045 --> 02:14:52,450
WE HAVE IT IN OUR POWER, SHOULD 

123
02:14:52,450 --> 02:14:54,185
WE SO CHOOSE, TO LIFT MILLIONS 

124
02:14:54,185 --> 02:14:57,021
FROM POVERTY, TO HELP OUR 

125
02:14:57,021 --> 02:14:58,022
CITIZENS REALIZE THEIR DREAMS, 

126
02:14:58,022 --> 02:14:59,724
AND TO ENSURE THAT NEW 

127
02:14:59,724 --> 02:15:01,860
GENERATIONS OF CHILDREN ARE 

128
02:15:01,860 --> 02:15:02,961
RAISED FREE FROM VIOLENCE, 

129
02:15:02,961 --> 02:15:07,265
HATRED, AND FEAR.

130
02:15:07,265 --> 02:15:10,301
THIS INSTITUTION WAS FOUNDED IN 

131
02:15:10,301 --> 02:15:15,873
THE AFTERMATH OF TWO WORLD WARS 

132
02:15:15,873 --> 02:15:18,510
TO HELP SHAPE THIS BETTER 

133
02:15:18,510 --> 02:15:18,810
FUTURE.

134
02:15:18,810 --> 02:15:20,211
IT WAS BASED ON THE DIVISION 

135
02:15:20,211 --> 02:15:21,245
THAT DIVERSE NATIONS COULD 

136
02:15:21,245 --> 02:15:24,716
COOPERATE TO PROTECT THEIR 

137
02:15:24,716 --> 02:15:26,017
SOVEREIGNTY, PRESERVE THEIR 

138
02:15:26,017 --> 02:15:28,753
SECURITY, AND PROMOTE THEIR 

139
02:15:28,753 --> 02:15:29,654
PROSPERITY.

140
02:15:29,654 --> 02:15:31,356
IT WAS IN THE SAME PERIOD 

141
02:15:31,356 --> 02:15:35,026
EXACTLY 70 YEARS AGO THAT THE 

142
02:15:35,026 --> 02:15:35,927
UNITED STATES DEVELOPED THE 

143
02:15:35,927 --> 02:15:39,097
MARSHALL PLAN TO HELP RESTORE 

144
02:15:39,097 --> 02:15:39,764
EUROPE.

145
02:15:39,764 --> 02:15:43,701
THOSE THREE BEAUTIFUL PILLARS, 

146
02:15:43,701 --> 02:15:47,005
THEY'RE PILLARS OF PEACE, 

147
02:15:47,005 --> 02:15:49,541
SOVEREIGNTY, SECURITY, AND 

148
02:15:49,541 --> 02:15:49,841
PROSPERITY.

149
02:15:49,841 --> 02:15:52,043
THE MARSHALL PLAN WAS BUILT ON 

150
02:15:52,043 --> 02:15:54,545
THE NOBLE IDEA THAT THE WHOLE 

151
02:15:54,545 --> 02:15:58,183
WORLD IS SAFER WHEN NATIONS ARE 

152
02:15:58,183 --> 02:16:02,554
STRONG, INDEPENDENT, AND FREE.

153
02:16:02,554 --> 02:16:04,522
AS PRESIDENT TRUMAN SAID IN HIS 

154
02:16:04,522 --> 02:16:06,758
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS AT THAT 

155
02:16:06,758 --> 02:16:09,160
TIME, OUR SUPPORT OF EUROPEAN 

156
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:12,397
RECOVERY IS IN FULL ACCORD WITH 

157
02:16:12,397 --> 02:16:15,000
OUR SUPPORT OF THE UNITED 

158
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:15,467
NATIONS.

159
02:16:15,467 --> 02:16:16,700
THE SUCCESS OF THE UNITED 

160
02:16:16,700 --> 02:16:18,970
NATIONS DEPENDS UPON THE 

161
02:16:18,970 --> 02:16:21,439
INDEPENDENT STRENGTH OF ITS 

162
02:16:21,439 --> 02:16:21,672
MEMBERS.

163
02:16:21,672 --> 02:16:25,377
TO OVERCOME THE PERILS OF THE 

164
02:16:25,377 --> 02:16:28,212
PRESENT AND TO ACHIEVE THE 

165
02:16:28,212 --> 02:16:28,980
PROMISE OF THE FUTURE, WE MUST 

166
02:16:28,980 --> 02:16:32,816
BEGIN WITH THE WISDOM OF THE 

167
02:16:32,816 --> 02:16:33,084
PAST.

168
02:16:33,084 --> 02:16:37,221
OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON A 

169
02:16:37,221 --> 02:16:38,323
COALITION OF STRONG AND 

170
02:16:38,323 --> 02:16:40,825
INDEPENDENT NATIONS THAT EMBRACE

171
02:16:40,825 --> 02:16:42,260
THEIR SOVEREIGNTY TO PROMOTE 

172
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:44,028
SECURITY, PROSPERITY AND PEACE 

173
02:16:44,028 --> 02:16:44,594
FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THE 

174
02:16:44,594 --> 02:16:48,733
WORLD.

175
02:16:48,733 --> 02:16:52,070
WE DO NOT EXPECT DIVERSE 

176
02:16:52,070 --> 02:16:54,472
COUNTRIES TO SHARE THE SAME 

177
02:16:54,472 --> 02:16:56,708
CULTURES, TRADITIONS, OR EVEN 

178
02:16:56,708 --> 02:16:59,144
SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT, BUT WE DO

179
02:16:59,144 --> 02:17:02,447
EXPECT ALL NATIONS TO UPHOLD 

180
02:17:02,447 --> 02:17:04,683
THESE TWO CORE SOVEREIGN DUTIES,

181
02:17:04,683 --> 02:17:06,484
TO RESPECT THE INTERESTS OF 

182
02:17:06,484 --> 02:17:08,820
THEIR OWN PEOPLE AND THE RIGHTS 

183
02:17:08,820 --> 02:17:12,424
OF EVERY OTHER SOVEREIGN NATION.

184
02:17:12,424 --> 02:17:15,393
THIS IS THE BEAUTIFUL VISION OF 

185
02:17:15,393 --> 02:17:16,928
THIS INSTITUTION, AND THIS IS 

186
02:17:16,928 --> 02:17:19,864
THE FOUNDATION FOR COOPERATION 

187
02:17:19,864 --> 02:17:26,236
AND SUCCESS.

188
02:17:26,236 --> 02:17:27,939
STRONG SOVEREIGN NATIONS LET 

189
02:17:27,939 --> 02:17:29,507
DIVERSE COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT

190
02:17:29,507 --> 02:17:31,575
VALUES, DIFFERENT CULTURES AND 

191
02:17:31,575 --> 02:17:33,745
DIFFERENT DREAMS NOT JUST 

192
02:17:33,745 --> 02:17:36,581
COEXIST BUT WORK SIDE BY SIDE ON

193
02:17:36,581 --> 02:17:40,118
THE BASIS OF MUTUAL RESPECT.

194
02:17:40,118 --> 02:17:42,153
STRONG SOVEREIGN NATIONS LET 

195
02:17:42,153 --> 02:17:43,821
THEIR PEOPLE TAKE OWNERSHIP OF 

196
02:17:43,821 --> 02:17:48,493
THE FUTURE AND CONTROL THEIR OWN

197
02:17:48,493 --> 02:17:48,860
DESTINY.

198
02:17:48,860 --> 02:17:51,329
AND STRONG SOVEREIGN NATIONS 

199
02:17:51,329 --> 02:17:52,963
ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO FLOURISH IN

200
02:17:52,963 --> 02:17:57,234
THE FULLNESS OF THE LIFE 

201
02:17:57,234 --> 02:17:57,936
INTENDED BY GOD.

202
02:17:57,936 --> 02:18:01,004
IN AMERICA, WE DO NOT SEEK TO 

203
02:18:01,004 --> 02:18:03,273
IMPOSE OUR WAY OF LIFE ON 

204
02:18:03,273 --> 02:18:05,041
ANYONE, BUT RATHER, TO LET IT 

205
02:18:05,041 --> 02:18:09,047
SHINE AS AN EXAMPLE FOR EVERYONE

206
02:18:09,047 --> 02:18:10,115
TO WATCH.

207
02:18:10,115 --> 02:18:13,885
THIS WEEK GIVES OUR COUNTRY A 

208
02:18:13,885 --> 02:18:16,486
SPECIAL REASON TO TAKE PRIDE IN 

209
02:18:16,486 --> 02:18:17,688
THAT EXAMPLE.

210
02:18:17,688 --> 02:18:21,592
WE ARE CELEBRATING THE 230th 

211
02:18:21,592 --> 02:18:24,829

CONSTITUTION STILL IN USE IN THE

214
02:18:29,868 --> 02:18:30,668
WORLD TODAY.

215
02:18:30,668 --> 02:18:32,468
THIS TIMELESS DOCUMENT HAS BEEN 

216
02:18:32,468 --> 02:18:35,373
THE FOUNDATION OF PEACE,

02:18:35,373 --> 02:18:38,609
PROSPERITY AND FREEDOM FOR THE 

218
02:18:38,609 --> 02:18:39,977
AMERICANS AND FOR COUNTLESS 

219
02:18:39,977 --> 02:18:42,046
MILLIONS AROUND THE GLOBE WHOSE 

220
02:18:42,046 --> 02:18:43,181
OWN COUNTRIES HAVE FOUND 

221
02:18:43,181 --> 02:18:45,116
INSPIRATION IN ITS RESPECT FOR 

222
02:18:45,116 --> 02:18:46,484
HUMAN NATURE, HUMAN DIGNITY, AND

223
02:18:46,484 --> 02:18:49,320
THE RULE OF LAW.

224
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:52,623
THE GREATEST IN THE UNITED 

225
02:18:52,623 --> 02:18:57,529
STATES CONSTITUTION IS ITS FIRST

226
02:18:57,529 --> 02:19:00,331
THREE BEAUTIFUL WORDS.

227
02:19:00,331 --> 02:19:03,802
THEY ARE, "WE THE PEOPLE."

228
02:19:03,802 --> 02:19:06,070
GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE 

229
02:19:06,070 --> 02:19:06,938
SACRIFICED TO MAINTAIN THE 

230
02:19:06,938 --> 02:19:08,638
PROMISE OF THOSE WORDS, THE 

231
02:19:08,638 --> 02:19:12,943
PROMISE OF OUR COUNTRY AND OF 

232
02:19:12,943 --> 02:19:14,579
OUR GREAT HISTORY.

233
02:19:14,579 --> 02:19:17,949
IN AMERICA, THE PEOPLE GOVERN.

234
02:19:17,949 --> 02:19:19,117
THE PEOPLE RULE.

235
02:19:19,117 --> 02:19:21,718
AND THE PEOPLE ARE SOVEREIGN.

236
02:19:21,718 --> 02:19:24,021
I WAS ELECTED NOT TO TAKE POWER 

237
02:19:24,021 --> 02:19:26,491
BUT TO GIVE POWER TO THE 

238
02:19:26,491 --> 02:19:28,726
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHERE IT 

239
02:19:28,726 --> 02:19:29,494
BELONGS.

240
02:19:29,494 --> 02:19:31,295
IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS WE ARE 

241
02:19:31,295 --> 02:19:32,696

242
02:19:32,696 --> 02:19:34,231
OF SOVEREIGNTY.

243
02:19:34,231 --> 02:19:36,901
OUR GOVERNMENT'S FIRST DUTY IS 

244
02:19:36,901 --> 02:19:40,171

[ APPLAUSE ]

256
02:20:10,268 --> 02:20:12,336
ALL RESPONSIBLE LEADERS HAVE AN 

257
02:20:12,336 --> 02:20:15,806
OBLIGATION TO SERVE THEIR OWN 

258
02:20:15,806 --> 02:20:17,174
CITIZENS AND THE NATION STATE

ELEVATING THE HUMAN CONDITION.

261
02:20:22,013 --> 02:20:26,651
BUT MAKING A BETTER LIFE FOR OUR

PEACEFUL FUTURE FOR ALL PEOPLE.

266
02:20:37,562 --> 02:20:39,030
THE UNITED STATES WILL FOREVER 

267
02:20:39,030 --> 02:20:42,032
BE A GREAT FRIEND TO THE WORLD, 

268
02:20:42,032 --> 02:20:45,069
AND ESPECIALLY TO ITS ALLIES.

269
02:20:45,069 --> 02:20:47,238
WE CAN NO LONGER BE TAKEN 

270
02:20:47,238 --> 02:20:49,874
ADVANTAGE OF OR ENTER INTO A 

271
02:20:49,874 --> 02:20:52,143
ONE-SIDED DEAL WHERE THE UNITED 

272
02:20:52,143 --> 02:20:54,812
STATES GETS NOTHING IN RETURN.

273
02:20:54,812 --> 02:20:57,948
AS LONG AS I HOLD THIS OFFICE, I

274
02:20:57,948 --> 02:21:00,751
WILL DEFEND AMERICA'S INTERESTS 

275
02:21:00,751 --> 02:21:02,920
ABOVE ALL ELSE, BUT IN 

276
02:21:02,920 --> 02:21:04,555
FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS TO 

277
02:21:04,555 --> 02:21:07,392
OUR OWN NATIONS, WE ALSO REALIZE

278
02:21:07,392 --> 02:21:09,193
THAT IT'S IN EVERYONE'S INTEREST

279
02:21:09,193 --> 02:21:11,996
TO SEEK A FUTURE WHERE ALL 

280
02:21:11,996 --> 02:21:15,666
NATIONS CAN BE SOVEREIGN, 

281
02:21:15,666 --> 02:21:18,002
PROSPEROUS AND SECURE.

282
02:21:18,002 --> 02:21:19,537
AMERICA DOES MORE THAN SPEAK FOR

283
02:21:19,537 --> 02:21:23,741
THE VALUES EXPRESSED IN THE 

284
02:21:23,741 --> 02:21:24,609
UNITED NATIONS CHARTER.

285
02:21:24,609 --> 02:21:27,111
OUR CITIZENS HAVE PAID THE 

286
02:21:27,111 --> 02:21:29,280
ULTIMATE PRICE TO DEFEND OUR 

287
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:33,117
FREEDOM AND THE FREEDOM OF MANY 

288
02:21:33,117 --> 02:21:34,885
NATIONS REPRESENTED IN THIS 

289
02:21:34,885 --> 02:21:36,721
GREAT HALL.

290
02:21:36,721 --> 02:21:39,089
AMERICA'S DEVOTION IS MEASURED 

291
02:21:39,089 --> 02:21:41,726
ON THE BATTLEFIELDS WHERE OUR 

292
02:21:41,726 --> 02:21:43,327
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN HAVE FOUGHT 

293
02:21:43,327 --> 02:21:45,797
AND SACRIFICED ALONGSIDE OF OUR 

294
02:21:45,797 --> 02:21:46,030
ALLIES.

295
02:21:46,030 --> 02:21:47,898
FROM THE BEACHES OF EUROPE TO 

296
02:21:47,898 --> 02:21:51,135
THE DESERTS OF THE MIDDLE EAST 

297
02:21:51,135 --> 02:21:56,341
TO THE JUNGLES OF ASIA, IT IS AN

298
02:21:56,341 --> 02:21:58,242
ETERNAL CREDIT TO THE AMERICAN 

299
02:21:58,242 --> 02:22:00,011
CHARACTER THAT EVEN AFTER WE AND

300
02:22:00,011 --> 02:22:02,547
OUR ALLIES EMERGE VICTORIOUS 

301
02:22:02,547 --> 02:22:05,216
FROM THE BLOODIEST WAR IN 

302
02:22:05,216 --> 02:22:09,420
HISTORY, WE DID NOT SEEK 

303
02:22:09,420 --> 02:22:11,355
TERRITORIAL EXPANSION OR ATTEMPT

304
02:22:11,355 --> 02:22:15,459
TO OPPOSE AND IMPOSE OUR WAY OF 

305
02:22:15,459 --> 02:22:17,561
LIFE ON OTHERS.

306
02:22:17,561 --> 02:22:19,196
INSTEAD, WE HELPED BUILD 

307
02:22:19,196 --> 02:22:21,866
INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THIS ONE TO

308
02:22:21,866 --> 02:22:25,103
DEFEND THE SOVEREIGNTY, 

309
02:22:25,103 --> 02:22:28,006
SECURITY, AND PROSPERITY FOR 

310
02:22:28,006 --> 02:22:28,272
ALL.

311
02:22:28,272 --> 02:22:31,442
FOR THE DIVERSE NATIONS OF THE 

312
02:22:31,442 --> 02:22:33,945
WORLD, THIS IS OUR HOPE.

313
02:22:33,945 --> 02:22:36,247
WE WANT HARMONY AND FRIENDSHIP, 

314
02:22:36,247 --> 02:22:39,350
NOT CONFLICT AND STRIFE.

315
02:22:39,350 --> 02:22:42,520
WE ARE GUIDED BY OUTCOMES, NOT 

316
02:22:42,520 --> 02:22:42,787
IDEOLOGY.

317
02:22:42,787 --> 02:22:46,290
WE HAVE A POLICY OF PRINCIPLED 

318
02:22:46,290 --> 02:22:49,794
REALISM ROOTED IN SHARED GOALS, 

319
02:22:49,794 --> 02:22:51,396
INTERESTS, AND VALUES.

320
02:22:51,396 --> 02:22:53,864
THAT REALISM FORCES US TO 

321
02:22:53,864 --> 02:22:56,334
CONFRONT A QUESTION FACING EVERY

322
02:22:56,334 --> 02:22:58,603
LEADER AND NATION IN THIS ROOM.

323
02:22:58,603 --> 02:23:00,271
IT IS A QUESTION WE CANNOT 

324
02:23:00,271 --> 02:23:02,707
ESCAPE OR AVOID.

325
02:23:02,707 --> 02:23:05,476
WE WILL SLIDE DOWN THE PATH OF 

326
02:23:05,476 --> 02:23:07,311
COMPLACENCY NUMB TO THE 

327
02:23:07,311 --> 02:23:08,846
CHALLENGES, THREATS AND EVEN 

328
02:23:08,846 --> 02:23:12,884
WARS THAT WE FACE.

329
02:23:12,884 --> 02:23:14,152
OR, DO WE HAVE ENOUGH STRENGTH 

330
02:23:14,152 --> 02:23:16,554
AND PRIDE TO CONFRONT THOSE 

331
02:23:16,554 --> 02:23:19,423
DANGERS TODAY SO THAT OUR 

332
02:23:19,423 --> 02:23:22,927
CITIZENS CAN ENJOY PEACE AND 

333
02:23:22,927 --> 02:23:23,961
PROSPERITY TOMORROW.

334
02:23:23,961 --> 02:23:26,998
IF WE DESIRE TO LIFT UP OUR 

335
02:23:26,998 --> 02:23:30,601
CITIZENS, IF WE ASPIRE TO THE 

336
02:23:30,601 --> 02:23:32,403
APPROVAL OF HISTORY, THEN WE 

337
02:23:32,403 --> 02:23:35,073
MUST FULFILL OUR SOVEREIGN 

338
02:23:35,073 --> 02:23:36,306
DUTIES TO THE PEOPLE WE 

339
02:23:36,306 --> 02:23:39,777
FAITHFULLY REPRESENT.

340
02:23:39,777 --> 02:23:42,546
WE MUST PROTECT OUR NATIONS, 

341
02:23:42,546 --> 02:23:44,082
THEIR INTERESTS AND THEIR 

342
02:23:44,082 --> 02:23:45,717
FUTURES.

343
02:23:45,717 --> 02:23:48,119
WE MUST REJECT THREATS TO 

344
02:23:48,119 --> 02:23:51,021
SOVEREIGNTY FROM THE UKRAINE TO 

345
02:23:51,021 --> 02:23:52,757
THE SOUTH CHINA SEA.

346
02:23:52,757 --> 02:23:56,360
WE MUST UPHOLD RESPECT FOR LAW, 

347
02:23:56,360 --> 02:24:00,164
RESPECT FOR BORDERS, AND RESPECT

348
02:24:00,164 --> 02:24:02,233
FOR CULTURE, AND THE PEACEFUL 

349
02:24:02,233 --> 02:24:05,837
ENGAGEMENT THESE ALLOW.

350
02:24:05,837 --> 02:24:07,038
AND JUST AS THE FOUNDERS OF THIS

351
02:24:07,038 --> 02:24:11,208
BODY INTENDED, WE MUST WORK 

352
02:24:11,208 --> 02:24:14,245
TOGETHER AND CONFRONT TOGETHER 

353
02:24:14,245 --> 02:24:19,350
THOSE WHO THREATEN US WITH 

354
02:24:19,350 --> 02:24:25,723
CHAOS, TURMOIL AND TERROR.

355
02:24:25,723 --> 02:24:29,460
THE SURCOURGE OF OUR PLANET TOD 

356
02:24:29,460 --> 02:24:31,362
VIOLATES THE VERY PRINCIPLE IN 

357
02:24:31,362 --> 02:24:33,030
WHICH THE UNITED NATIONS IS 

358
02:24:33,030 --> 02:24:33,698
BASED.

359
02:24:33,698 --> 02:24:35,099
THEY RESPECT NEITHER THEIR OWN 

360
02:24:35,099 --> 02:24:36,667
CITIZENS NOR THE SOVEREIGN 

361
02:24:36,667 --> 02:24:38,803
RIGHTS OF THEIR COUNTRIES.

362
02:24:38,803 --> 02:24:42,439
IF THE RIGHTEOUS MANY DO NOT 

363
02:24:42,439 --> 02:24:45,843
CONFRONT THE WICKED FEW, THEN 

364
02:24:45,843 --> 02:24:47,378
EVIL WILL TRIUMPH.

365
02:24:47,378 --> 02:24:49,246
WHEN DECENT PEOPLE AND NATIONS 

366
02:24:49,246 --> 02:24:52,450
BECOME BYSTANDERS TO HISTORY, 

367
02:24:52,450 --> 02:24:54,585
THE FORCES OF DESTRUCTION ONLY 

368
02:24:54,585 --> 02:24:56,920
GATHER POWER AND STRENGTH.

369
02:24:56,920 --> 02:24:59,690
NO ONE HAS SHOWN MORE CONTEMPT 

370
02:24:59,690 --> 02:25:01,192
FOR OTHER NATIONS AND FOR THE 

371
02:25:01,192 --> 02:25:03,894
WELL-BEING OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE 

372
02:25:03,894 --> 02:25:08,299
THAN THE DEPRAVED REGIME IN 

373
02:25:08,299 --> 02:25:09,300
NORTH KOREA.

374
02:25:09,300 --> 02:25:10,801
IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 

375
02:25:10,801 --> 02:25:13,971
STARVATION DEATHS OF MILLIONS OF

376
02:25:13,971 --> 02:25:17,441
NORTH KOREANS, AND FOR THE 

377
02:25:17,441 --> 02:25:18,241
IMPRISONMENT, TORTURE, KILLING 

378
02:25:18,241 --> 02:25:20,278
AND OPPRESSION OF COUNTLESS 

379
02:25:20,278 --> 02:25:20,778
MORE.

380
02:25:20,778 --> 02:25:22,747
WE WERE ALL WITNESS TO THE 

381
02:25:22,747 --> 02:25:26,584
REGIME'S DEADLY ABUSE WHEN AN 

382
02:25:26,584 --> 02:25:30,154
INNOCENT AMERICAN COLLEGE 

383
02:25:30,154 --> 02:25:32,857
STUDENT, OTTO WARMBIER, WAS 

384
02:25:32,857 --> 02:25:34,558
RETURNED TO AMERICA ONLY TO DIE 

385
02:25:34,558 --> 02:25:38,162
A FEW DAYS LATER.

386
02:25:38,162 --> 02:25:40,397
WE SAW IT IN THE ASSASSINATION 

387
02:25:40,397 --> 02:25:44,202
OF THE DICTATOR'S BROTHER, USING

388
02:25:44,202 --> 02:25:46,904
BANNED NERVE AGENTS IN AN 

389
02:25:46,904 --> 02:25:48,606
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.

390
02:25:48,606 --> 02:25:52,777
WE KNOW IT KIDNAPPED A SWEET 

391
02:25:52,777 --> 02:25:53,711
13-YEAR-OLD JAPANESE GIRL FROM A

392
02:25:53,711 --> 02:25:58,015
BEACH IN HER OWN COUNTRY TO 

393
02:25:58,015 --> 02:25:59,483
ENSLAVE HER AS A LANGUAGE TUTOR 

394
02:25:59,483 --> 02:26:02,520
FOR NORTH KOREA'S SPIES.

395
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:05,389
IF THIS IS NOT TWISTED ENOUGH, 

396
02:26:05,389 --> 02:26:07,725
NOW NORTH KOREA'S RECKLESS 

397
02:26:07,725 --> 02:26:10,661
PURSUIT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND 

398
02:26:10,661 --> 02:26:14,198
BALLISTIC MISSILES THREATENS THE

399
02:26:14,198 --> 02:26:16,234
ENTIRE WORLD WITH UNTHINKABLE 

400
02:26:16,234 --> 02:26:17,835
LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE.

401
02:26:17,835 --> 02:26:19,303
IT IS AN OUTRAGE THAT SOME 

402
02:26:19,303 --> 02:26:20,738
NATIONS WOULD NOT ONLY TRADE 

403
02:26:20,738 --> 02:26:22,874
WITH SUCH A REGIME BUT WOULD 

404
02:26:22,874 --> 02:26:23,875
ARM, SUPPLY AND FINANCIALLY 

405
02:26:23,875 --> 02:26:29,647
SUPPORT A COUNTRY THAT IMPERILS 

406
02:26:29,647 --> 02:26:31,248
THE WORLD WITH NUCLEAR CONFLICT.

407
02:26:31,248 --> 02:26:33,617
NO NATION ON EARTH HAS AN 

408
02:26:33,617 --> 02:26:35,252
INTEREST IN SEEING THIS BAND OF 

409
02:26:35,252 --> 02:26:38,155
CRIMINALS ARM ITSELF WITH 

410
02:26:38,155 --> 02:26:41,659
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND MISSILES.

411
02:26:41,659 --> 02:26:42,359
THE UNITED STATES HAS GREAT 

412
02:26:42,359 --> 02:26:44,262
STRENGTH AND PATIENCE, BUT IF IT

413
02:26:44,262 --> 02:26:45,929
IS FORCED TO DEFEND ITSELF OR 

414
02:26:45,929 --> 02:26:48,265
ITS ALLIES, WE WILL HAVE NO 

415
02:26:48,265 --> 02:26:53,370
CHOICE BUT TO TOTALLY DESTROY 

416
02:26:53,370 --> 02:26:56,207
NORTH KOREA.

417
02:26:56,207 --> 02:26:56,774
ROCKET MAN IS ON A SUICIDE 

418
02:26:56,774 --> 02:26:59,944
MISSION FOR HIMSELF AND FOR HIS 

419
02:26:59,944 --> 02:27:00,211
REGIME.

420
02:27:00,211 --> 02:27:03,814
THE UNITED STATES IS READY, 

421
02:27:03,814 --> 02:27:05,816
WILLING AND ABLE, BUT HOPEFULLY 

422
02:27:05,816 --> 02:27:08,486
THIS WILL NOT BE NECESSARY.

423
02:27:08,486 --> 02:27:11,722
THAT'S WHAT THE UNITED NATIONS 

424
02:27:11,722 --> 02:27:14,158
IS ALL ABOUT.

425
02:27:14,158 --> 02:27:16,560
THAT'S WHAT THE UNITED NATIONS 

426
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:19,430
IS FOR.

427
02:27:19,430 --> 02:27:20,264
LET'S SEE HOW THEY DO.

428
02:27:20,264 --> 02:27:24,368
IT IS TIME FOR NORTH KOREA TO 

429
02:27:24,368 --> 02:27:29,306
REALIZE THAT THE 

430
02:27:29,306 --> 02:27:29,907
DENUCLEARIZATION IS ITS ONLY 

431
02:27:29,907 --> 02:27:31,242
ACCEPTABLE FUTURE.

432
02:27:31,242 --> 02:27:32,676
THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY 

433
02:27:32,676 --> 02:27:35,646
COUNCIL RECENTLY HELD TWO 

434
02:27:35,646 --> 02:27:38,215
UNANIMOUS 15-0 VOTES ADOPTING 

435
02:27:38,215 --> 02:27:40,184
HARD-HITTING RESOLUTIONS AGAINST

436
02:27:40,184 --> 02:27:42,553
NORTH KOREA, AND I WANT TO THANK

437
02:27:42,553 --> 02:27:44,221
CHINA AND RUSSIA FOR JOINING THE

438
02:27:44,221 --> 02:27:46,857
VOTE TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS, ALONG 

439
02:27:46,857 --> 02:27:49,893
WITH ALL OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF

440
02:27:49,893 --> 02:27:51,329
THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL.

441
02:27:51,329 --> 02:27:53,998
THANK YOU TO ALL INVOLVED.

442
02:27:53,998 --> 02:27:56,567
BUT WE MUST DO MUCH MORE.

443
02:27:56,567 --> 02:27:58,502
IT IS TIME FOR ALL NATIONS TO 

444
02:27:58,502 --> 02:28:01,172
WORK TOGETHER TO ISOLATE THE KIM

445
02:28:01,172 --> 02:28:06,343
REGIME UNTIL IT CEASES ITS 

446
02:28:06,343 --> 02:28:06,743
HOSTILE BEHAVIOR.

447
02:28:06,743 --> 02:28:10,848
WE FACE THIS DECISION NOT ONLY 

448
02:28:10,848 --> 02:28:12,616
IN NORTH KOREA.

449
02:28:12,616 --> 02:28:15,252
IT IS FAR PAST TIME FOR THE 

450
02:28:15,252 --> 02:28:18,089
NATIONS OF THE WORLD TO CONFRONT

451
02:28:18,089 --> 02:28:19,923
ANOTHER RECKLESS REGIME, ONE 

452
02:28:19,923 --> 02:28:21,425
THAT SPEAKS OPENLY OF MASS 

453
02:28:21,425 --> 02:28:22,960
MURDER, VOWING DEATH TO AMERICA,

454
02:28:22,960 --> 02:28:25,396
DESTRUCTION TO ISRAEL AND RUIN 

455
02:28:25,396 --> 02:28:27,765
FOR MANY LEADERS AND NATIONS IN 

456
02:28:27,765 --> 02:28:28,632
THIS ROOM.

457
02:28:28,632 --> 02:28:31,368
THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT MASKS A 

458
02:28:31,368 --> 02:28:34,338
CORRUPT DICTATORSHIP BEHIND THE 

459
02:28:34,338 --> 02:28:37,208
FALSE GUISE OF A DEMOCRACY.

460
02:28:37,208 --> 02:28:39,143
IT HAS TURNED A WEALTHY COUNTRY 

461
02:28:39,143 --> 02:28:42,246
WITH A RICH HISTORY AND CULTURE 

462
02:28:42,246 --> 02:28:45,649
INTO AN ECONOMICALLY DEPLETED 

463
02:28:45,649 --> 02:28:48,152
ROGUE STATE WHOSE CHEAP EXPORTS 

464
02:28:48,152 --> 02:28:54,358
ARE VIOLENT, BLOODSHED AND 

465
02:28:54,358 --> 02:28:55,092
CHAOS.

466
02:28:55,092 --> 02:28:57,028
THE LONGEST SUFFERING VICTIMS OF

467
02:28:57,028 --> 02:28:58,896
IRAN'S LEADERS ARE, IN FACT, ITS

468
02:28:58,896 --> 02:28:59,864
OWN PEOPLE.

469
02:28:59,864 --> 02:29:02,433
RATHER THAN USE ITS RESOURCES TO

470
02:29:02,433 --> 02:29:05,369
IMPROVE IRANIAN LIVES, ITS OIL 

471
02:29:05,369 --> 02:29:09,974
PROFITS GO TO FUND HEZBOLLAH AND

472
02:29:09,974 --> 02:29:11,976
OTHER TERRORISTS THAT KILL 

473
02:29:11,976 --> 02:29:13,210
INNOCENT MUSLIMS AND ATTACK 

474
02:29:13,210 --> 02:29:18,482
THEIR PEACEFUL ARAB AND ISRAELI 

475
02:29:18,482 --> 02:29:20,718
NEIGHBORS.

476
02:29:20,718 --> 02:29:22,919
THIS WEALTH WHICH RIGHTLY 

477
02:29:22,919 --> 02:29:24,521
BELONGS TO IRAN'S PEOPLE ALSO 

478
02:29:24,521 --> 02:29:28,492
GOES TO SHORE UP BASHAR AL 

479
02:29:28,492 --> 02:29:29,593
ASSAD'S DICTATORSHIP, FUEL 

480
02:29:29,593 --> 02:29:30,928
YEMEN'S CIVIL WAR AND UNDERMINE 

481
02:29:30,928 --> 02:29:34,598
PEACE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE 

482
02:29:34,598 --> 02:29:36,534
MIDDLE EAST.

483
02:29:36,534 --> 02:29:40,971
WE CANNOT LET A MURDEROUS REGIME

484
02:29:40,971 --> 02:29:44,108
CONTINUE THESE DESTABILIZING 

485
02:29:44,108 --> 02:29:45,309
ACTIVITIES WHILE BUILDING 

486
02:29:45,309 --> 02:29:47,111
DANGEROUS MISSILES, AND WE 

487
02:29:47,111 --> 02:29:49,980
CANNOT ABIDE BY AN AGREEMENT IF 

488
02:29:49,980 --> 02:29:52,950
IT PROVIDES COVER FOR THE 

489
02:29:52,950 --> 02:29:55,786
EVENTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF A 

490
02:29:55,786 --> 02:29:56,153
NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

491
02:29:56,153 --> 02:30:04,261
[ APPLAUSE ]

492
02:30:04,261 --> 02:30:06,130
THE IRAN DEAL WAS ONE OF THE 

493
02:30:06,130 --> 02:30:09,800
WORST AND MOST ONE-SIDED 

494
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:11,302
TRANSACTIONS THE UNITED STATES 

495
02:30:11,302 --> 02:30:14,238
HAS EVER ENTERED INTO.

496
02:30:14,238 --> 02:30:15,806
FRANKLY, THAT DEAL IS AN 

497
02:30:15,806 --> 02:30:17,842
EMBARRASSMENT TO THE UNITED 

498
02:30:17,842 --> 02:30:18,909
STATES, AND I DON'T THINK YOU'VE

499
02:30:18,909 --> 02:30:19,543
HEARD THE LAST OF IT, BELIEVE 

500
02:30:19,543 --> 02:30:24,014
ME.

501
02:30:24,014 --> 02:30:26,650
IT IS TIME FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD 

502
02:30:26,650 --> 02:30:29,053
TO JOIN US IN DEMANDING THAT 

503
02:30:29,053 --> 02:30:31,255
IRAN'S GOVERNMENT END ITS 

504
02:30:31,255 --> 02:30:33,724
PURSUIT OF DEATH AND 

505
02:30:33,724 --> 02:30:34,024
DESTRUCTION.

506
02:30:34,024 --> 02:30:36,693
IT IS TIME FOR THE REGIME TO 

507
02:30:36,693 --> 02:30:38,929
FREE ALL AMERICANS AND CITIZENS 

508
02:30:38,929 --> 02:30:41,398
OF OTHER NATIONS THAT THEY HAVE 

509
02:30:41,398 --> 02:30:43,166
UNJUSTLY DETAINED.

510
02:30:43,166 --> 02:30:46,003
AND ABOVE ALL, IRAN'S GOVERNMENT

511
02:30:46,003 --> 02:30:48,439
MUST STOP SUPPORTING TERRORISTS,

512
02:30:48,439 --> 02:30:50,473
BEGIN SERVING ITS OWN PEOPLE, 

513
02:30:50,473 --> 02:30:51,842
AND RESPECT THE SOVEREIGN RIGHTS

514
02:30:51,842 --> 02:30:55,846
OF ITS NEIGHBORS.

515
02:30:55,846 --> 02:30:57,147
THE ENTIRE WORLD UNDERSTANDS 

516
02:30:57,147 --> 02:30:59,149
THAT THE GOOD PEOPLE OF IRAN 

517
02:30:59,149 --> 02:31:02,086
WANT CHANGE, AND OTHER THAN THE 

518
02:31:02,086 --> 02:31:04,354
VAST MILITARY POWER OF THE 

519
02:31:04,354 --> 02:31:05,923
UNITED STATES, THAT IRAN'S 

520
02:31:05,923 --> 02:31:07,991
PEOPLE ARE WHAT THEIR LEADERS 

521
02:31:07,991 --> 02:31:11,295
FEAR THE MOST.

522
02:31:11,295 --> 02:31:14,831
THIS IS WHAT CAUSES THE REGIME 

523
02:31:14,831 --> 02:31:18,969
TO RESTRICT INTERNET ACCESS, 

524
02:31:18,969 --> 02:31:20,404
TEAR DOWN SATELLITE DISHES, 

525
02:31:20,404 --> 02:31:22,840
SHOOT UNARMED STUDENT 

526
02:31:22,840 --> 02:31:26,443
PROTESTORS, AND IMPRISONEN 

527
02:31:26,443 --> 02:31:29,280
POLITICAL REFORMERS.

528
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:30,814
OPPRESSIVE REGIMES CANNOT ENDURE

529
02:31:30,814 --> 02:31:33,817
FOREVER, AND THE DAY WILL COME 

530
02:31:33,817 --> 02:31:36,086
WHEN THE PEOPLE WILL FACE A 

531
02:31:36,086 --> 02:31:36,319
CHOICE.

532
02:31:36,319 --> 02:31:39,723
WILL THEY CONTINUE DOWN THE PATH

533
02:31:39,723 --> 02:31:43,227
OF POSIVPOVERTY, BLOOD SHED AND 

534
02:31:43,227 --> 02:31:44,227
TERROR, OR WILL THE IRANIAN 

535
02:31:44,227 --> 02:31:46,096
PEOPLE RETURN TO THE NATION'S 

536
02:31:46,096 --> 02:31:48,898
PROUD ROOTS AS A CENTER OF 

537
02:31:48,898 --> 02:31:51,735
CIVILIZATION, CULTURE AND WEALTH

538
02:31:51,735 --> 02:31:53,070
WHERE THEIR PEOPLE CAN BE HAPPY 

539
02:31:53,070 --> 02:31:58,742
AND PROSPEROUS ONCE AGAIN.

540
02:31:58,742 --> 02:31:59,810
THE IRANIAN REGIME SUPPORT FOR 

541
02:31:59,810 --> 02:32:02,913
TERROR IS IN STARK CONTRAST TO 

542
02:32:02,913 --> 02:32:04,814
THE RECENT COMMITMENTS OF MANY 

543
02:32:04,814 --> 02:32:06,683
OF ITS NEIGHBORS TO FIGHT 

544
02:32:06,683 --> 02:32:08,552
TERRORISM AND HALT ITS 

545
02:32:08,552 --> 02:32:10,621
FINANCING.

546
02:32:10,621 --> 02:32:12,122
IN SAUDI ARABIA EARLY LAST YEAR,

547
02:32:12,122 --> 02:32:16,327
I WAS GREATLY HONORED TO ADDRESS

548
02:32:16,327 --> 02:32:21,498
THE LEADERS OF MORE THAN 50 ARAB

549
02:32:21,498 --> 02:32:22,266
AND MUSLIM NATIONS.

550
02:32:22,266 --> 02:32:24,502
WE AGREED THAT ALL RESPONSIBLE 

551
02:32:24,502 --> 02:32:28,305
NATIONS MUST WORK TOGETHER TO 

552
02:32:28,305 --> 02:32:31,341
CONFRONT TERRORISTS AND THE 

553
02:32:31,341 --> 02:32:33,310
ISLAMIC EXTREMISM THAT INSPIRES 

554
02:32:33,310 --> 02:32:33,510
THEM.

555
02:32:33,510 --> 02:32:38,015
WE WILL STOP RADICAL ISLAMIC 

556
02:32:38,015 --> 02:32:38,582
TERRORISM BECAUSE WE CANNOT 

557
02:32:38,582 --> 02:32:43,854
ALLOW IT TO TEAR UP OUR NATION 

558
02:32:43,854 --> 02:32:46,390
AND INDEED TO TEAR UP THE ENTIRE

559
02:32:46,390 --> 02:32:46,690
WORLD.

560
02:32:46,690 --> 02:32:49,059
WE MUST DENY THE TERRORISTS SAFE

561
02:32:49,059 --> 02:32:52,329
HAVEN, TRANSIT, FUNDING, AND ANY

562
02:32:52,329 --> 02:32:55,299
FORM OF SUPPORT FOR THEIR VILE 

563
02:32:55,299 --> 02:32:57,234
AND SINISTER IDEOLOGY.

564
02:32:57,234 --> 02:32:59,937
WE MUST DRIVE THEM OUT OF OUR 

565
02:32:59,937 --> 02:33:01,372
NATIONS.

566
02:33:01,372 --> 02:33:03,374
IT IS TIME TO EXPOSE AND HOLD 

567
02:33:03,374 --> 02:33:07,644
RESPONSIBLE THOSE COUNTRIES WHO 

568
02:33:07,644 --> 02:33:09,913
SUPPORT AND FINANCE TERROR 

569
02:33:09,913 --> 02:33:12,182
GROUPS LIKE AL QAEDA, HEZBOLLAH,

570
02:33:12,182 --> 02:33:15,285
THE TALIBAN, AND OTHERS THAT 

571
02:33:15,285 --> 02:33:17,655
SLAUGHTER INNOCENT PEOPLE.

572
02:33:17,655 --> 02:33:19,323
THE UNITED STATES AND OUR ALLIES

573
02:33:19,323 --> 02:33:21,258
ARE WORKING TOGETHER THROUGHOUT 

574
02:33:21,258 --> 02:33:23,727
THE MIDDLE EAST TO CRUSH THE 

575
02:33:23,727 --> 02:33:26,964
LOSER TERRORISTS AND STOP THE 

576
02:33:26,964 --> 02:33:28,865
REEMERGENCE OF SAFE HAVENS THEY 

577
02:33:28,865 --> 02:33:32,469
USE TO LAUNCH ATTACKS ON ALL OF 

578
02:33:32,469 --> 02:33:33,937
OUR PEOPLE.

579
02:33:33,937 --> 02:33:35,806
LAST MONTH I ANNOUNCED A NEW 

580
02:33:35,806 --> 02:33:38,475
STRATEGY FOR VICTORY IN THE 

581
02:33:38,475 --> 02:33:42,179
FIGHT AGAINST THIS EVIL IN 

582
02:33:42,179 --> 02:33:42,579
AFGHANISTAN.

583
02:33:42,579 --> 02:33:43,981
FROM NOW ON, OUR SECURITY 

584
02:33:43,981 --> 02:33:45,882
INTERESTS WILL DICTATE THE 

585
02:33:45,882 --> 02:33:49,752
LENGTH AND SCOPE OF MILITARY 

586
02:33:49,752 --> 02:33:52,790
OPERATIONS, NOT ARBITRARY 

587
02:33:52,790 --> 02:33:54,992
BENCHMARKS AND TIMETABLES SET UP

588
02:33:54,992 --> 02:33:55,392
BY POLITICIANS.

589
02:33:55,392 --> 02:33:58,629
I HAVE ALSO TOTALLY CHANGED THE 

590
02:33:58,629 --> 02:34:00,664
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT IN OUR FIGHT

591
02:34:00,664 --> 02:34:04,768
AGAINST THE TALIBAN AND OTHER 

592
02:34:04,768 --> 02:34:05,836
TERRORIST GROUPS.

593
02:34:05,836 --> 02:34:08,905
IN SYRIA AND IRAQ, WE HAVE MADE 

594
02:34:08,905 --> 02:34:11,675
BIG GAINS TOWARD LASTING DEFEAT 

595
02:34:11,675 --> 02:34:12,743
OF ISIS.

596
02:34:12,743 --> 02:34:15,012
IN FACT, OUR COUNTRY HAS 

597
02:34:15,012 --> 02:34:17,814
ACHIEVED MORE AGAINST ISIS IN 

598
02:34:17,814 --> 02:34:20,150
THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS THAN IT 

599
02:34:20,150 --> 02:34:24,288
HAS IN MANY, MANY YEARS 

600
02:34:24,288 --> 02:34:25,189
COMBINED.

601
02:34:25,189 --> 02:34:29,092
WE SEEK THE DEESCALATION OF THE 

602
02:34:29,092 --> 02:34:31,094
SYRIAN CONFLICT AND A POLITICAL 

603
02:34:31,094 --> 02:34:32,896
SOLUTION THAT HONORS THE WILL OF

604
02:34:32,896 --> 02:34:37,100
THE SYRIAN PEOPLE.

605
02:34:37,100 --> 02:34:38,068
THE ACTIONS OF THE CRIMINAL 

606
02:34:38,068 --> 02:34:41,705
REGIME OF BASHAR AL ASSAD, 

607
02:34:41,705 --> 02:34:43,573
INCLUDING THE USE OF CHEMICAL 

608
02:34:43,573 --> 02:34:47,044
WEAPONS AGAINST HIS OWN 

609
02:34:47,044 --> 02:34:48,212
CITIZENS, EVEN INNOCENT 

610
02:34:48,212 --> 02:34:50,147
CHILDREN, SHOCK THE CONSCIENCE 

611
02:34:50,147 --> 02:34:53,450
OF EVERY DECENT PERSON.

612
02:34:53,450 --> 02:34:55,619
NO SOCIETY COULD BE SAFE IF 

613
02:34:55,619 --> 02:34:59,689
BANNED CHEMICAL WEAPONS ARE 

614
02:34:59,689 --> 02:35:01,525
ALLOWED TO SPREAD.

615
02:35:01,525 --> 02:35:03,260
THAT IS WHY THE UNITED STATES 

616
02:35:03,260 --> 02:35:06,196
CARRIED OUT A MISSILE STRIKE ON 

617
02:35:06,196 --> 02:35:10,134
THE AIR BASE THAT LAUNCHED THE 

618
02:35:10,134 --> 02:35:10,367
ATTACK.

619
02:35:10,367 --> 02:35:12,436
WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE

620
02:35:12,436 --> 02:35:13,904
UNITED NATIONS' AGENCIES THAT 

621
02:35:13,904 --> 02:35:17,574
ARE PROVIDING VITAL HUMANITARIAN

622
02:35:17,574 --> 02:35:19,476
ASSISTANCE IN AREAS LIBERATED 

623
02:35:19,476 --> 02:35:22,512
FROM ISIS, AND WE ESPECIALLY 

624
02:35:22,512 --> 02:35:24,815
THANK JORDAN, TURKEY, AND 

625
02:35:24,815 --> 02:35:27,217
LEBANON FOR THEIR ROLE IN 

626
02:35:27,217 --> 02:35:29,686
HOSTING REFUGEES FROM THE SYRIAN

627
02:35:29,686 --> 02:35:34,191
CONFLICT.

628
02:35:34,191 --> 02:35:37,527
THE UNITED STATES IS A 

629
02:35:37,527 --> 02:35:38,929
COMPASSIONATE NATION AND HAS 

630
02:35:38,929 --> 02:35:41,331
SPENT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF 

631
02:35:41,331 --> 02:35:43,032
DOLLARS IN HELPING TO SUPPORT 

632
02:35:43,032 --> 02:35:43,967
THIS EFFORT.

633
02:35:43,967 --> 02:35:48,905
WE SEEK AN APPROACH TO REFUGEE 

634
02:35:48,905 --> 02:35:51,175
RESETTLEMENT THAT IS DESIGNED TO

635
02:35:51,175 --> 02:35:52,542
HELP THESE HORRIBLY TREATED 

636
02:35:52,542 --> 02:35:54,377
PEOPLE AND WHICH ENABLES THEIR 

637
02:35:54,377 --> 02:35:57,514
EVENTUAL RETURN TO THEIR HOME 

638
02:35:57,514 --> 02:35:58,081
COUNTRIES TO BE PART OF THE 

639
02:35:58,081 --> 02:36:03,987
REBUILDING PROCESS.

640
02:36:03,987 --> 02:36:05,789
FOR THE COST OF RESETTLING ONE 

641
02:36:05,789 --> 02:36:07,557
REFUGEE IN THE UNITED STATES, WE

642
02:36:07,557 --> 02:36:11,195
CAN ASSIST MORE THAN 10 IN THEIR

643
02:36:11,195 --> 02:36:11,829
HOME REGION.

644
02:36:11,829 --> 02:36:13,830
OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF OUR 

645
02:36:13,830 --> 02:36:14,965
HEARTS, WE OFFER FINANCIAL 

646
02:36:14,965 --> 02:36:16,967
ASSISTANCE TO HOSTING COUNTRIES 

647
02:36:16,967 --> 02:36:19,803
IN THE REGION, AND WE SUPPORT 

648
02:36:19,803 --> 02:36:22,272
RECENT AGREEMENTS OF THE G20 

649
02:36:22,272 --> 02:36:24,407
NATIONS THAT WILL SEEK TO HOST 

650
02:36:24,407 --> 02:36:26,376
REFUGEES AS CLOSE TO THEIR HOME 

651
02:36:26,376 --> 02:36:29,880
COUNTRIES AS POSSIBLE.

652
02:36:29,880 --> 02:36:33,416
THIS IS THE SAFE, RESPONSIBLE, 

653
02:36:33,416 --> 02:36:37,521
AND HUMANITARIAN APPROACH.

654
02:36:37,521 --> 02:36:38,121
FOOR

655
02:36:38,121 --> 02:36:38,956
FOR DECADES THE UNITED STATES 

656
02:36:38,956 --> 02:36:40,690
HAS DEALT WITH MIGRATION 

657
02:36:40,690 --> 02:36:43,093
CHALLENGES HERE IN THE WESTERN 

658
02:36:43,093 --> 02:36:43,393
HEMISPHERE.

659
02:36:43,393 --> 02:36:45,595
WE HAVE LEARNED THAT OVER THE 

660
02:36:45,595 --> 02:36:47,564
LONG TERM, UNCONTROLLED 

661
02:36:47,564 --> 02:36:49,199
MIGRATION IS DEEPLY UNFAIR TO 

662
02:36:49,199 --> 02:36:51,801
BOTH THE SENDING AND THE 

663
02:36:51,801 --> 02:36:53,170
RECEIVING COUNTRIES.

664
02:36:53,170 --> 02:36:55,138
FOR THE SENDING COUNTRIES, IT 

665
02:36:55,138 --> 02:36:57,707
REDUCES DOMESTIC PRESSURE TO 

666
02:36:57,707 --> 02:37:01,511
PURSUE NEEDED POLITICAL AND 

667
02:37:01,511 --> 02:37:05,348
ECONOMIC REFORM AND DRAINS THEM 

668
02:37:05,348 --> 02:37:05,982
OF THE HUMAN CAPITAL NECESSARY 

669
02:37:05,982 --> 02:37:10,554
TO MOTIVATE AND IMPLEMENT THOSE 

670
02:37:10,554 --> 02:37:10,888
REFORMS.

671
02:37:10,888 --> 02:37:13,957
FOR THE RECEIVING COUNTRIES, THE

672
02:37:13,957 --> 02:37:17,561
SUBSTANTIAL COSTS OF 

673
02:37:17,561 --> 02:37:20,197
UNCONTROLLED MIGRATION ARE BOURN

674
02:37:20,197 --> 02:37:21,164
OVERWHELMINGLY BY LOW INCOME 

675
02:37:21,164 --> 02:37:22,532
CITIZENS WHOSE CONCERNS ARE 

676
02:37:22,532 --> 02:37:27,337
OFTEN IGNORED BY BOTH MEDIA AND 

677
02:37:27,337 --> 02:37:27,670
GOVERNMENT.

678
02:37:27,670 --> 02:37:29,540
I WANT TO SALUTE THE WORK OF THE

679
02:37:29,540 --> 02:37:31,174
UNITED NATIONS IN SEEKING TO 

680
02:37:31,174 --> 02:37:33,510
ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THAT CAUSE 

681
02:37:33,510 --> 02:37:37,514
PEOPLE TO FLEE FROM THEIR HOMES.

682
02:37:37,514 --> 02:37:41,585
THE UNITED NATIONS AND AFRICAN 

683
02:37:41,585 --> 02:37:47,023
UNION LED PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS 

684
02:37:47,023 --> 02:37:49,025
TO HAVE INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS

685
02:37:49,025 --> 02:37:50,928
IN STABILIZING CONFLICTS IN 

686
02:37:50,928 --> 02:37:51,161
AFRICA.

687
02:37:51,161 --> 02:37:52,095
THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES TO 

688
02:37:52,095 --> 02:37:56,333
LEAD THE WORLD IN HUMANITARIAN 

689
02:37:56,333 --> 02:37:57,634

SUDAN, SOMALIA, AND NORTHERN 

692
02:38:04,741 --> 02:38:06,375
NIGERIA AND YEMEN.

693
02:38:06,375 --> 02:38:08,044
WE HAVE INVESTED IN BETTER 

694
02:38:08,044 --> 02:38:10,814
HEALTH AND OPPORTUNITY ALL OVER 

695
02:38:10,814 --> 02:38:14,851

PART OF OUR COMMITMENT TO

02:38:34,638 --> 02:38:35,272
EMPOWERING WOMEN ALL ACROSS THE

706
02:38:38,375 --> 02:38:38,775
WE ALSO THANK --

THANK YOU.

709
02:38:47,184 --> 02:38:49,319
WE ALSO THANK THE SECRETARY 

710
02:38:49,319 --> 02:38:53,523
GENERAL FOR RECOGNIZING THAT THE

711
02:38:53,523 --> 02:38:55,258
UNITED NATIONS MUST REFORM IF IT

712
02:38:55,258 --> 02:38:57,694
IS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE PARTNER IN

713
02:38:57,694 --> 02:38:59,997
CONFRONTING THREATS TO 

714
02:38:59,997 --> 02:39:02,565
SOVEREIGNTY, SECURITY, AND 

715
02:39:02,565 --> 02:39:03,066
PROSPERITY.

716
02:39:03,066 --> 02:39:05,802
TOO OFTEN THE FOCUS OF THIS 

717
02:39:05,802 --> 02:39:07,971
ORGANIZATION HAS NOT BEEN ON 

718
02:39:07,971 --> 02:39:11,341
RESULTS BUT ON BUREAUCRACY AND 

719
02:39:11,341 --> 02:39:11,575
PROCESS.

720
02:39:11,575 --> 02:39:14,044
IN SOME CASES, STATES THAT SEEK 

721
02:39:14,044 --> 02:39:22,486
TO SUBVERT THIS INSTITUTION'S 

722
02:39:22,486 --> 02:39:23,853
NOBLE HAVE HIJACKED THE VERY 

723
02:39:23,853 --> 02:39:25,822
SYSTEMS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO 

724
02:39:25,822 --> 02:39:26,323
ADVANCE THEM.

725
02:39:26,323 --> 02:39:30,493
FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS A MASSIVE 

726
02:39:30,493 --> 02:39:32,128
SOURCE OF EMBARRASSMENT TO THE 

727
02:39:32,128 --> 02:39:33,496
UNITED NATIONS THAT SOME 

728
02:39:33,496 --> 02:39:34,998
GOVERNMENTS WITH EGREGIOUS HUMAN

729
02:39:34,998 --> 02:39:39,035

730
02:39:39,035 --> 02:39:42,506
HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL.

731
02:39:42,506 --> 02:39:45,074
THE UNITED STATES IS 1 OUT OF 

732
02:39:45,074 --> 02:39:46,609
193 COUNTRIES IN THE UNITED 

733
02:39:46,609 --> 02:39:50,280
NATIONS, AND YET WE PAY 22% OF 

734
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:53,617
THE ENTIRE BUDGET AND MORE.

735
02:39:53,617 --> 02:39:56,553
IN FACT, WE PAY FAR MORE THAN 

736
02:39:56,553 --> 02:39:58,521
ANYBODY REALIZES.

737
02:39:58,521 --> 02:40:00,957
THE UNITED STATES BEARS AN 

738
02:40:00,957 --> 02:40:03,493
UNFAIR COST BURDEN, BUT TO BE 

739
02:40:03,493 --> 02:40:07,330
FAIR, IF IT COULD ACTUALLY 

740
02:40:07,330 --> 02:40:09,132
ACCOMPLISH ALL OF ITS STATED 

741
02:40:09,132 --> 02:40:12,969
GOALS, ESPECIALLY THE GOAL OF 

742
02:40:12,969 --> 02:40:15,138
PEACE, THIS INVESTMENT WOULD 

743
02:40:15,138 --> 02:40:19,176
EASILY BE WELL WORTH IT.

744
02:40:19,176 --> 02:40:21,544
MAJOR PORTIONS OF THE WORLD ARE 

745
02:40:21,544 --> 02:40:23,179
IN CONFLICT AND SOME, IN FACT, 

746
02:40:23,179 --> 02:40:25,582
ARE GOING TO HELL, BUT THE 

747
02:40:25,582 --> 02:40:28,985
POWERFUL PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM 

748
02:40:28,985 --> 02:40:32,355
UNDER THE GUIDANCE AND AUSPICES 

749
02:40:32,355 --> 02:40:34,858
OF THE UNITED NATIONS CAN SOLVE 

750
02:40:34,858 --> 02:40:36,259
MANY OF THESE VICIOUS AND 

751
02:40:36,259 --> 02:40:36,993
COMPLEX PROBLEMS.

752
02:40:36,993 --> 02:40:38,127
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HOPE THAT 

753
02:40:38,127 --> 02:40:41,498
ONE DAY SOON THE UNITED NATIONS 

754
02:40:41,498 --> 02:40:44,100
CAN BE A MUCH MORE ACCOUNTABLE 

755
02:40:44,100 --> 02:40:47,370
AND EFFECTIVE ADVOCATE FOR HUMAN

756
02:40:47,370 --> 02:40:48,004
DIGNITY AND FREEDOM AROUND THE 

757
02:40:48,004 --> 02:40:50,607
WORLD.

758
02:40:50,607 --> 02:40:53,310
IN THE MEANTIME, WE BELIEVE THAT

759
02:40:53,310 --> 02:40:56,246
NO NATION SHOULD HAVE TO BEAR A 

760
02:40:56,246 --> 02:40:59,282
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE 

761
02:40:59,282 --> 02:41:00,951
BURDEN MILITARILY OR 

762
02:41:00,951 --> 02:41:01,251
FINANCIALLY.

763
02:41:01,251 --> 02:41:02,419
NATIONS OF THE WORLD MUST TAKE A

764
02:41:02,419 --> 02:41:08,391
GREATER ROLE IN PROMOTING SECURE

765
02:41:08,391 --> 02:41:09,792
AND PROSPEROUS SOCIETIES IN 

766
02:41:09,792 --> 02:41:11,261
THEIR OWN REGIONS.

767
02:41:11,261 --> 02:41:12,562
THAT IS WHY IN THE WESTERN 

768
02:41:12,562 --> 02:41:13,964
HEMISPHERE THE UNITED STATES HAS

769
02:41:13,964 --> 02:41:16,466
STOOD AGAINST THE CORRUPT 

770
02:41:16,466 --> 02:41:18,401
DESTABILIZING REGIME IN CUBA AND

771
02:41:18,401 --> 02:41:20,870
EMBRACED THE ENDURING DREAM OF 

772
02:41:20,870 --> 02:41:24,474
THE CUBAN PEOPLE TO LIVE IN 

773
02:41:24,474 --> 02:41:24,707
FREEDOM.

774
02:41:24,707 --> 02:41:26,242
MY ADMINISTRATION RECENTLY 

775
02:41:26,242 --> 02:41:28,945
ANNOUNCED THAT WE WILL NOT LIFT 

776
02:41:28,945 --> 02:41:31,214
SANCTIONS ON THE CUBAN 

777
02:41:31,214 --> 02:41:34,551
GOVERNMENT UNTIL IT MAKES 

778
02:41:34,551 --> 02:41:35,652
FUNDAMENTAL REFORMS.

779
02:41:35,652 --> 02:41:38,354
WE HAVE ALSO IMPOSED TOUGH 

780
02:41:38,354 --> 02:41:41,224
CALIBRATED SANCTIONS ON THE 

781
02:41:41,224 --> 02:41:44,828
SOCIALIST MADURO REGIME IN 

782
02:41:44,828 --> 02:41:46,696
VENEZUELA WHICH HAS BROUGHT A 

783
02:41:46,696 --> 02:41:48,464
ONCE THRIVING NATION TO THE 

784
02:41:48,464 --> 02:41:51,067
BRINK OF TOTAL COLLAPSE.

785
02:41:51,067 --> 02:41:55,271
THE SOCIALIST DICTATORSHIP OF 

786
02:41:55,271 --> 02:41:56,573
NICOLAS MADURO HAS INFLICTED 

787
02:41:56,573 --> 02:41:59,075
MATERIAL PAIN AND SUFFERING ON 

788
02:41:59,075 --> 02:42:02,445
THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THAT COUNTRY.

789
02:42:02,445 --> 02:42:04,848
THIS CORRUPT REGIME DESTROYED A 

790
02:42:04,848 --> 02:42:07,817
PROSPEROUS NATION BY IMPOSING A 

791
02:42:07,817 --> 02:42:09,586
FAILED IDEOLOGY THAT HAS 

792
02:42:09,586 --> 02:42:12,789
PRODUCED POVERTY AND MISERY 

793
02:42:12,789 --> 02:42:15,559
EVERYWHERE IT HAS BEEN TRIED.

794
02:42:15,559 --> 02:42:18,094
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, MADURO 

795
02:42:18,094 --> 02:42:19,229
HAS DEFIED HIS OWN PEOPLE, 

796
02:42:19,229 --> 02:42:22,933
STEALING POWER FROM THEIR 

797
02:42:22,933 --> 02:42:25,068
ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES TO 

798
02:42:25,068 --> 02:42:30,407
PRESERVE HIS DISASTROUS RULE.

799
02:42:30,407 --> 02:42:31,241
THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE ARE 

800
02:42:31,241 --> 02:42:33,176
STARVING AND THEIR COUNTRY IS 

801
02:42:33,176 --> 02:42:34,411
COLLAPSING.

802
02:42:34,411 --> 02:42:37,614
THEIR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS 

803
02:42:37,614 --> 02:42:38,481
ARE BEING DESTROYED.

804
02:42:38,481 --> 02:42:41,418
THIS SITUATION IS COMPLETELY 

805
02:42:41,418 --> 02:42:42,318
UNACCEPTABLE, AND WE CANNOT 

806
02:42:42,318 --> 02:42:46,389
STAND BY AND WATCH.

807
02:42:46,389 --> 02:42:49,025
AS A RESPONSIBLE NEIGHBOR AND 

808
02:42:49,025 --> 02:42:53,263
FRIEND, WE AND ALL OTHERS HAVE A

809
02:42:53,263 --> 02:42:53,964
GOAL.

810
02:42:53,964 --> 02:42:57,067
THAT GOAL IS TO HELP THEM REGAIN

811
02:42:57,067 --> 02:43:00,570
THEIR FREEDOM, RECOVER THEIR 

812
02:43:00,570 --> 02:43:03,340
COUNTRY, AND RESTORE THEIR 

813
02:43:03,340 --> 02:43:03,607
DEMOCRACY.

814
02:43:03,607 --> 02:43:05,609
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK LEADERS IN

815
02:43:05,609 --> 02:43:08,478
THIS ROOM FOR CONDEMNING THE 

816
02:43:08,478 --> 02:43:10,546
REGIME AND PROVIDING VITAL 

817
02:43:10,546 --> 02:43:13,350
SUPPORT TO THE VENEZUELAN 

818
02:43:13,350 --> 02:43:13,583
PEOPLE.

819
02:43:13,583 --> 02:43:15,585
THE UNITED STATES HAS TAKEN 

820
02:43:15,585 --> 02:43:17,053
IMPORTANT STEPS TO HOLD THE 

821
02:43:17,053 --> 02:43:19,189
REGIME ACCOUNTABLE.

822
02:43:19,189 --> 02:43:20,990
WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE FURTHER 

823
02:43:20,990 --> 02:43:22,692
ACTION IF THE GOVERNMENT OF 

824
02:43:22,692 --> 02:43:26,897
VENEZUELA PERSISTS ON ITS PATH 

825
02:43:26,897 --> 02:43:28,498
TO IMPOSE AUTHORITARIAN RULE ON 

826
02:43:28,498 --> 02:43:32,335
THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE.

827
02:43:32,335 --> 02:43:34,804
WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE 

828
02:43:34,804 --> 02:43:35,438
INCREDIBLY STRONG AND HEALTHY 

829
02:43:35,438 --> 02:43:38,875
TRADE RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANY OF

830
02:43:38,875 --> 02:43:41,077
THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES 

831
02:43:41,077 --> 02:43:42,512
GATHERED HERE TODAY.

832
02:43:42,512 --> 02:43:44,347
OUR ECONOMIC BOND FORMS A 

833
02:43:44,347 --> 02:43:45,982
CRITICAL FOUNDATION FOR 

834
02:43:45,982 --> 02:43:48,718
ADVANCING PEACE AND PROSPERITY 

835
02:43:48,718 --> 02:43:51,955
FOR ALL OF OUR PEOPLE AND ALL OF

836
02:43:51,955 --> 02:43:52,756
OUR NEIGHBORS.

837
02:43:52,756 --> 02:43:55,792
I ASK EVERY COUNTRY REPRESENTED 

838
02:43:55,792 --> 02:44:00,363
HERE TODAY TO BE PREPARED TO DO 

839
02:44:00,363 --> 02:44:05,802
MORE TO ADDRESS THIS VERY REAL 

840
02:44:05,802 --> 02:44:06,035
CRISES.

841
02:44:06,035 --> 02:44:07,671
WE CALL FOR THE FULL RESTORATION

842
02:44:07,671 --> 02:44:10,106
OF DEMOCRACY AND POLITICAL 

843
02:44:10,106 --> 02:44:11,341
FREEDOMS IN VENEZUELA.

844
02:44:11,341 --> 02:44:18,915
[ APPLAUSE ]

845
02:44:18,915 --> 02:44:22,051
THE PROBLEM IN VENEZUELA IS NOT 

846
02:44:22,051 --> 02:44:24,287
THAT SOCIALISM HAS BEEN POORLY 

847
02:44:24,287 --> 02:44:27,323
IMPLEMENTED, BUT THAT SOCIALISM 

848
02:44:27,323 --> 02:44:35,165
HAS BEEN FAITHFULLY IMPLEMENTED.

849
02:44:35,165 --> 02:44:39,636
[ APPLAUSE ]

850
02:44:39,636 --> 02:44:42,005
FROM THE SOVIET UNION TO CUBA TO

851
02:44:42,005 --> 02:44:44,273
VENEZUELA, WHEREVER TRUE 

852
02:44:44,273 --> 02:44:47,043
SOCIALISM OR COMMUNISM HAS BEEN 

853
02:44:47,043 --> 02:44:48,311
ADOPTED, IT HAS DELIVERED 

854
02:44:48,311 --> 02:44:51,214
ANGUISH AND DEVASTATION AND 

855
02:44:51,214 --> 02:44:51,982
FAILURE.

856
02:44:51,982 --> 02:44:54,617
THOSE WHO PREACH THE TENANTS OF 

857
02:44:54,617 --> 02:44:58,388
THESE DISCREDITED IDEOLOGIES 

858
02:44:58,388 --> 02:44:59,422
ONLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONTINUED

859
02:44:59,422 --> 02:45:01,358
SUFFERING OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE

860
02:45:01,358 --> 02:45:04,561
UNDER THESE CRUEL SYSTEMS.

861
02:45:04,561 --> 02:45:06,663
AMERICA STANDS WITH EVERY PERSON

862
02:45:06,663 --> 02:45:09,466
LIVING UNDER A BRUTAL REGIME.

863
02:45:09,466 --> 02:45:12,001
OUR RESPECT FOR SOVEREIGNTY IS 

864
02:45:12,001 --> 02:45:15,372
ALSO A CALL FOR ACTION.

865
02:45:15,372 --> 02:45:16,906
ALL PEOPLE DESERVE A GOVERNMENT 

866
02:45:16,906 --> 02:45:19,675
THAT CARES FOR THEIR SAFETY, 

867
02:45:19,675 --> 02:45:22,012
THEIR INTERESTS AND THEIR 

868
02:45:22,012 --> 02:45:25,548
WELL-BEING, INCLUDING THEIR 

869
02:45:25,548 --> 02:45:25,848
PROSPERITY.

870
02:45:25,848 --> 02:45:27,183
IN AMERICA WE SEEK STRONGER TIES

871
02:45:27,183 --> 02:45:31,954
OF BUSINESS AND TRADE WITH ALL 

872
02:45:31,954 --> 02:45:33,789
NATIONS OF GOOD WILL, BUT THIS 

873
02:45:33,789 --> 02:45:35,024
TRADE MUST BE FAIR AND IT MUST 

874
02:45:35,024 --> 02:45:35,892
BE RECIPROCAL.

875
02:45:35,892 --> 02:45:40,063
FOR TOO LONG THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

876
02:45:40,063 --> 02:45:46,503
WERE TOLD THAT MAMMOTH 

877
02:45:46,503 --> 02:45:50,206
MULTI-NATIONAL TRADE DEALS AND 

878
02:45:50,206 --> 02:45:51,708
POWERFUL GLOBAL BUREAUCRACIES 

879
02:45:51,708 --> 02:45:52,975
WERE THE BEST WAY TO PROMOTE 

880
02:45:52,975 --> 02:45:54,110
THEIR SUCCESS.

881
02:45:54,110 --> 02:45:56,679
BUT AS THOSE PROMISES FLOWED, 

882
02:45:56,679 --> 02:45:59,248
MILLIONS OF JOBS VANISHED AND 

883
02:45:59,248 --> 02:46:03,353
THOUSANDS OF FACTORIES 

884
02:46:03,353 --> 02:46:03,820
DISAPPEARED.

885
02:46:03,820 --> 02:46:07,390
OTHERS GAMED THE SYSTEM AND 

886
02:46:07,390 --> 02:46:10,260
BROKE THE RULES.

887
02:46:10,260 --> 02:46:15,165
OUR GREAT MIDDLE CLASS, ONCE THE

888
02:46:15,165 --> 02:46:16,832
BEDROCK OF AMERICAN PROSPERITY, 

889
02:46:16,832 --> 02:46:20,003
WAS FORGOTTEN AND LEFT BEHIND.

890
02:46:20,003 --> 02:46:22,305
BUT THEY ARE FORGOTTEN NO MORE, 

891
02:46:22,305 --> 02:46:22,939
AND THEY WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN

892
02:46:22,939 --> 02:46:28,978
AGAIN.

893
02:46:28,978 --> 02:46:30,914
WHILE AMERICA WILL PURSUE 

894
02:46:30,914 --> 02:46:32,982
COOPERATION AND COMMERCE WITH 

895
02:46:32,982 --> 02:46:34,617
OTHER NATIONS, WE ARE RENEWING 

896
02:46:34,617 --> 02:46:38,021
OUR COMMITMENT TO THE FIRST DUTY

897
02:46:38,021 --> 02:46:40,457
OF EVERY GOVERNMENT, THE DUTY OF

898
02:46:40,457 --> 02:46:42,058
OUR CITIZENS.

899
02:46:42,058 --> 02:46:44,727
THIS BOND IS THE SOURCE OF 

900
02:46:44,727 --> 02:46:48,698
AMERICA'S STRENGTH AND THAT OF 

901
02:46:48,698 --> 02:46:50,600
EVERY RESPONSIBLE NATION 

902
02:46:50,600 --> 02:46:52,569
REPRESENTED HERE TODAY.

903
02:46:52,569 --> 02:46:53,803
IF THIS ORGANIZATION IS TO HAVE 

904
02:46:53,803 --> 02:46:56,405
ANY HOPE OF SUCCESSFULLY 

905
02:46:56,405 --> 02:46:57,773
CONFRONTING THE CHALLENGES 

906
02:46:57,773 --> 02:47:01,277
BEFORE US, IT WILL DEPEND, AS 

907
02:47:01,277 --> 02:47:04,780
PRESIDENT TRUMAN SAID SOME 70 

908
02:47:04,780 --> 02:47:07,083
YEARS AGO, ON THE INDEPENDENT 

909
02:47:07,083 --> 02:47:09,486
STRENGTH OF ITS MEMBERS.

910
02:47:09,486 --> 02:47:11,320
IF WE ARE TO EMBRACE THE 

911
02:47:11,320 --> 02:47:12,956
OPPORTUNITIES OF THE FUTURE AND 

912
02:47:12,956 --> 02:47:17,060
OVERCOME THE PRESENT DANGERS 

913
02:47:17,060 --> 02:47:19,328
TOGETHER, THERE CAN BE NO 

914
02:47:19,328 --> 02:47:22,832
SUBSTITUTE FOR STRONG, 

915
02:47:22,832 --> 02:47:24,100
SOVEREIGN, AND INDEPENDENT 

916
02:47:24,100 --> 02:47:27,337
NATIONS, NATIONS THAT ARE ROOTED

917
02:47:27,337 --> 02:47:29,138
IN THEIR HISTORIES AND INVESTED 

918
02:47:29,138 --> 02:47:32,408
IN THEIR DESTINIES, NATIONS THAT

919
02:47:32,408 --> 02:47:35,411
SEEK ALLIES TO BEFRIEND, NOT 

920
02:47:35,411 --> 02:47:37,346
ENEMIES TO CONQUER, AND MOST 

921
02:47:37,346 --> 02:47:39,549
IMPORTANT OF ALL, NATIONS THAT 

922
02:47:39,549 --> 02:47:42,952
ARE HOME TO PATRIOTS, TO MEN AND

923
02:47:42,952 --> 02:47:44,420
WOMEN WHO ARE WILLING TO 

924
02:47:44,420 --> 02:47:47,056
SACRIFICE FOR THEIR COUNTRIES, 

925
02:47:47,056 --> 02:47:50,159
THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS, AND FOR 

926
02:47:50,159 --> 02:47:53,630
ALL THAT IS BEST IN THE HUMAN 

927
02:47:53,630 --> 02:47:53,863
SPIRIT.

928
02:47:53,863 --> 02:47:55,932
IN REMEMBERING THE GREAT VICTORY

929
02:47:55,932 --> 02:47:57,867
THAT LED TO THIS BODY'S 

930
02:47:57,867 --> 02:47:59,468
FOUNDING, WE MUST NEVER FORGET 

931
02:47:59,468 --> 02:48:02,305
THAT THOSE HEROS WHO FOUGHT 

932
02:48:02,305 --> 02:48:07,110
AGAINST EVIL ALSO FOUGHT FOR THE

933
02:48:07,110 --> 02:48:11,080
NATIONS THAT THEY LOVED.

934
02:48:11,080 --> 02:48:13,816
PATRIOTISM LED THE POLES TO DIE 

935
02:48:13,816 --> 02:48:15,218
TO SAVE POLAND, THE FRENCH TO 

936
02:48:15,218 --> 02:48:19,222
FIGHT FOR A FREE FRANCE, AND THE

937
02:48:19,222 --> 02:48:20,489
BRITS TO STAND STRONG FOR 

938
02:48:20,489 --> 02:48:20,890
BRITAIN.

939
02:48:20,890 --> 02:48:23,426
TODAY, IF WE DO NOT INVEST 

940
02:48:23,426 --> 02:48:27,196
OURSELVES, OUR HEARTS AND OUR 

941
02:48:27,196 --> 02:48:27,897
MINDS IN OUR NATIONS, IF WE WILL

942
02:48:27,897 --> 02:48:29,832
NOT BUILD STRONG FAMILIES, SAFE 

943
02:48:29,832 --> 02:48:31,367
COMMUNITIES, AND HEALTHY 

944
02:48:31,367 --> 02:48:34,103
SOCIETIES FOR OURSELVES, NO ONE 

945
02:48:34,103 --> 02:48:36,906
CAN DO IT FOR US.

946
02:48:36,906 --> 02:48:40,510
WE CANNOT WAIT FOR SOMEONE ELSE,

947
02:48:40,510 --> 02:48:43,680
FOR FARAWAY COUNTRIES OR FAR OFF

948
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:44,347
BUREAUCRACIES.

949
02:48:44,347 --> 02:48:46,216
WE CAN'T DO IT.

950
02:48:46,216 --> 02:48:48,851
WE MUST SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS TO 

951
02:48:48,851 --> 02:48:52,521
BUILD OUR PROSPERITY, TO SECURE 

952
02:48:52,521 --> 02:48:54,490
OUR FUTURE, OR WE WILL BUILD 

953
02:48:54,490 --> 02:48:57,993
VULNERABLE TO DECAY, DOMINATION 

954
02:48:57,993 --> 02:49:00,629
AND DEFEAT.

955
02:49:00,629 --> 02:49:01,464
THE TRUE QUESTION FOR THE UNITED

956
02:49:01,464 --> 02:49:03,366
NATIONS TODAY, FOR PEOPLE ALL 

957
02:49:03,366 --> 02:49:04,634
OVER THE WORLD WHO HOPED FOR 

958
02:49:04,634 --> 02:49:07,069
BETTER LIVES FOR THEMSELVES AND 

959
02:49:07,069 --> 02:49:11,140
THEIR CHILDREN, IS A BASIC ONE.

960
02:49:11,140 --> 02:49:13,208
ARE WE STILL PATRIOTS.

961
02:49:13,208 --> 02:49:16,312
DO WE LOVE OUR NATIONS ENOUGH TO

962
02:49:16,312 --> 02:49:17,814
PROTECT THEIR SOVEREIGNTY AND TO

963
02:49:17,814 --> 02:49:20,350
TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR FUTURES.

964
02:49:20,350 --> 02:49:24,687
DO WE REVERE THEM ENOUGH TO 

965
02:49:24,687 --> 02:49:26,221
DEFEND THEIR INTERESTS, PRESERVE

966
02:49:26,221 --> 02:49:30,059
THEIR CULTURES, AND ENSURE A 

967
02:49:30,059 --> 02:49:32,228
PEACEFUL WORLD FOR THEIR 

968
02:49:32,228 --> 02:49:32,495
CITIZENS.

969
02:49:32,495 --> 02:49:34,630
ONE OF THE GREATEST AMERICAN 

970
02:49:34,630 --> 02:49:38,101
PATRIOTS, JOHN ADAMS, WROTE THAT

971
02:49:38,101 --> 02:49:40,837
THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION AFFECTED

972
02:49:40,837 --> 02:49:43,372
BEFORE THE WAR COMMENCED.

973
02:49:43,372 --> 02:49:45,975
THE REVOLUTION WAS IN THE MINDS 

974
02:49:45,975 --> 02:49:48,678
AND HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE.

975
02:49:48,678 --> 02:49:51,214
THAT WAS THE MOMENT WHEN AMERICA

976
02:49:51,214 --> 02:49:54,350
AWOKE, WHEN WE LOOKED AROUND AND

977
02:49:54,350 --> 02:49:56,352
UNDERSTOOD THAT WE WERE A 

978
02:49:56,352 --> 02:49:56,585
NATION.

979
02:49:56,585 --> 02:50:00,056
WE REALIZED WHO WE WERE, WHAT WE

980
02:50:00,056 --> 02:50:03,359
VALUED, AND WHAT WE WOULD GIVE 

981
02:50:03,359 --> 02:50:05,528
OUR LIVES TO DEFEND.

982
02:50:05,528 --> 02:50:07,263
FROM ITS VERY FIRST MOMENTS, THE

983
02:50:07,263 --> 02:50:11,400
AMERICAN STORY IS THE STORY OF 

984
02:50:11,400 --> 02:50:13,669
WHAT IS POSSIBLE WHEN PEOPLE 

985
02:50:13,669 --> 02:50:18,274
TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR FUTURE.

986
02:50:18,274 --> 02:50:19,875
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS

987
02:50:19,875 --> 02:50:21,277
BEEN AMONG THE GREATEST FORCES 

988
02:50:21,277 --> 02:50:23,012
FOR GOOD IN THE HISTORY OF THE 

989
02:50:23,012 --> 02:50:24,580
WORLD AND THE GREATEST DEFENDERS

990
02:50:24,580 --> 02:50:28,351
OF SOVEREIGNTY, SECURITY, AND 

991
02:50:28,351 --> 02:50:31,354
PROSPERITY FOR ALL.

992
02:50:31,354 --> 02:50:36,025
NOW WE ARE CALLING FOR A GREAT 

993
02:50:36,025 --> 02:50:38,427
REAWAKENING OF NATIONS, FOR THE 

994
02:50:38,427 --> 02:50:41,764
REVIVAL OF THEIR SPIRITS, THEIR 

995
02:50:41,764 --> 02:50:45,168
PRIDE, THEIR PEOPLE, AND THEIR 

996
02:50:45,168 --> 02:50:45,468
PATRIOTISM.

997
02:50:45,468 --> 02:50:47,403
HISTORY IS ASKING US WHETHER WE 

998
02:50:47,403 --> 02:50:50,306
ARE UP TO THE TASK.

999
02:50:50,306 --> 02:50:53,676
OUR ANSWER WILL BE A RENEWAL OF 

1000
02:50:53,676 --> 02:50:56,412
WILL, A REDISCOVERY OF RESOLVE, 

1001
02:50:56,412 --> 02:50:59,816
AND A REBIRTH OF DEVOTION.

1002
02:50:59,816 --> 02:51:03,653
WE NEED TO DEFEAT THE ENEMIES OF

1003
02:51:03,653 --> 02:51:06,489
HUMANITY AND UNLOCK THE 

1004
02:51:06,489 --> 02:51:09,025
POTENTIAL OF LIFE ITSELF.

1005
02:51:09,025 --> 02:51:15,531
OUR HOPE IS A WORD AND WORLD OF 

1006
02:51:15,531 --> 02:51:17,233
PROUD, INDEPENDENT NATIONS THAT 

1007
02:51:17,233 --> 02:51:20,303
EMBRACE THEIR DUTIES, SEEK 

1008
02:51:20,303 --> 02:51:23,205
FRIENDSHIP, RESPECT OTHERS, AND 

1009
02:51:23,205 --> 02:51:24,874
MAKE COMMON CAUSE IN THE 

1010
02:51:24,874 --> 02:51:26,342
GREATEST SHARED INTEREST OF ALL,

1011
02:51:26,342 --> 02:51:29,478
A FUTURE OF DIGNITY AND PEACE 

1012
02:51:29,478 --> 02:51:33,216
FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS WONDERFUL

1013
02:51:33,216 --> 02:51:33,449
EARTH.

1014
02:51:33,449 --> 02:51:37,353
THIS IS THE TRUE VISION OF THE 

1015
02:51:37,353 --> 02:51:39,255
UNITED NATIONS, THE ANCIENT WISH

1016
02:51:39,255 --> 02:51:41,691
OF EVERY PEOPLE, AND THE DEEPEST

1017
02:51:41,691 --> 02:51:46,229
YEARNING THAT LIVES INSIDE EVERY

1018
02:51:46,229 --> 02:51:47,096
SACRED SOUL.

1019
02:51:47,096 --> 02:51:49,431
SO LET THIS BE OUR MISSION.

1020
02:51:49,431 --> 02:51:52,501
AND LET THIS BE OUR MESSAGE TO 

1021
02:51:52,501 --> 02:51:54,404
THE WORLD.

1022
02:51:54,404 --> 02:51:56,705
WE WILL FIGHT TOGETHER, 

1023
02:51:56,705 --> 02:52:02,478
SACRIFICE TOGETHER, AND STAND 

1024
02:52:02,478 --> 02:52:03,112
TOGETHER FOR PEACE, FOR FREEDOM,

1025
02:52:03,112 --> 02:52:07,150
FOR JUSTICE, FOR FAMILY, FOR 

1026
02:52:07,150 --> 02:52:09,618
HUMANITY, AND FOR THE ALMIGHTY 

1027

THANK YOU.

WORLD.

1032

AND GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES

FIRST ADDRESS TO THE U.N. 

1039
02:52:28,971 --> 02:52:29,806
GENERAL ASSEMBLY.

1040
02:52:29,806 --> 02:52:34,010
JUST OVER 40 MINUTES THERE WHERE

1041
02:52:34,010 --> 02:52:35,244
THE PRESIDENT MEDITATED ON THE 

1042
02:52:35,244 --> 02:52:36,712
THEME OF STRONG SOVEREIGN NATION

1043
02:52:36,712 --> 02:52:40,116
SAYING AT A TIME OF IMMENSE 

1044
02:52:40,116 --> 02:52:40,817
PERIL, HE WILL ALWAYS PUT

AMERICA FIRST AS AMERICA'S 

1046

PRESIDENT.

1047
02:52:43,619 --> 02:52:44,253
STRONGEST WORDS, TOUGHEST WORDS 

1048
02:52:44,253 --> 02:52:44,953
FOR NORTH KOREA IN THIS SPEECH.

1049
02:52:44,953 --> 02:52:49,392

RADDATZ.

1053
02:52:51,994 --> 02:52:53,462
HE SAID IF THE UNITED STATES IS 

1054
02:52:53,462 --> 02:52:54,463
FORCE TO DEFEND OURSELVES 

1055
02:52:54,463 --> 02:52:55,465
AGAINST NORTH KOREA, NORTH KOREA

1056
02:52:55,465 --> 02:52:57,200
WILL BE TOTALLY DESTROYED, EVEN 

1057
02:52:57,200 --> 02:52:59,769
USED HIS ANY NICKNAME FOR KIM 

1058
02:52:59,769 --> 02:53:00,736
JONG-UN, ROCKET MAN. 

1059
02:53:00,736 --> 02:53:01,737
>> HE SURE DID, GEORGE.

1060
02:53:01,737 --> 02:53:03,005
THESE ARE THE STRONGEST WORDS WE

1061
02:53:03,005 --> 02:53:05,040
HAVE SEEN THE PRESIDENT SAY AND 

1062
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:06,876
CERTAINLY MADE MUCH STRONGER 

1063
02:53:06,876 --> 02:53:08,544
BECAUSE OF THE SETTING, BECAUSE 

1064
02:53:08,544 --> 02:53:09,811
HE IS SPEAKING IN FRONT OF THE 

1065
02:53:09,811 --> 02:53:10,947
WORLD.

1066
02:53:10,947 --> 02:53:16,319
THESE WERE NOT OFF-THE-CUFF 

1067
02:53:16,319 --> 02:53:16,552
REMARKS.

1068
02:53:16,552 --> 02:53:17,286
THIS WAS NOT A TWEET.

1069
02:53:17,286 --> 02:53:18,420
WE TALKED ABOUT THE FIRE AND 

1070
02:53:18,420 --> 02:53:19,822
FURY COMMENTS FROM LAST MONTH, 

1071
02:53:19,822 --> 02:53:22,258
BUT THIS BEFORE THE WORLD BODY 

1072
02:53:22,258 --> 02:53:23,859
SAYING THEY WOULD TOTALLY 

1073
02:53:23,859 --> 02:53:24,494
DESTROY NORTH KOREA.

1074
02:53:24,494 --> 02:53:29,332
IT'S A VERY SOBERING MESSAGE FOR

1075
02:53:29,332 --> 02:53:31,534
KIM JONG-UN, SOMETHING HE IS 

1076
02:53:31,534 --> 02:53:32,969
UNDOUBTEDLY LISTENING TO. 

1077
02:53:32,969 --> 02:53:34,971
>> HE'S LISTENING.

1078

THE NORTH KOREAN AMBASSADOR 

1079
02:53:35,971 --> 02:53:37,306
ACTUALLY WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM 

1080
02:53:37,306 --> 02:53:38,774
BY THE TIME THE PRESIDENT SPOKE.

1081
02:53:38,774 --> 02:53:40,977
THE PRESIDENT SAID 

1082
02:53:40,977 --> 02:53:42,444
DENUCLEARIZATION, NORTH KOREA 

1083
02:53:42,444 --> 02:53:44,346
GETTING RID OF ITS NUCLEAR 

1084
02:53:44,346 --> 02:53:46,415
WEAPONS THE ONLY OPTION.

1085
02:53:46,415 --> 02:53:53,422
I WANT TO BRING IN TERRY MORMOR.

1086
02:53:53,422 --> 02:53:55,391
TERRY, A VERY UNAPOLOGETIC 

1087
02:53:55,391 --> 02:53:55,992
SPEECH FROM TRUMP. 

1088
02:53:55,992 --> 02:53:57,560
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1089
02:53:57,560 --> 02:54:00,129
THIS IS THE REVENGE OF THE 

1090
02:54:00,129 --> 02:54:01,630
NATIONS STATE THIS WAS MEANT TO 

1091
02:54:01,630 --> 02:54:03,299
BRING THE NATIONS TOGETHER AFTER

1092
02:54:03,299 --> 02:54:06,635
THEY TORE THE WORLD APART IN 

1093
02:54:06,635 --> 02:54:07,737
WORLD WAR II.

1094
02:54:07,737 --> 02:54:11,974
EVERY AMERICAN PRESIDENT SINCE 

1095
02:54:11,974 --> 02:54:15,611
THEN HAS AT LEAST PAID LIP 

1096
02:54:15,611 --> 02:54:17,046
SERVICE TO THIS NOTION OF 

1097
02:54:17,046 --> 02:54:18,981
BRINGING THE NATIONS TOGETHER

02:54:18,981 --> 02:54:22,017
UNDER THE eJIS OF THE UNITED 

1099

NATIONS.

1100
02:54:22,518 --> 02:54:25,154
THIS WAS VERY DIFFERENT.

1101
02:54:25,154 --> 02:54:26,054
HE SAID SOMETHING THAT VLADIMIR 

1102
02:54:26,054 --> 02:54:26,688
PUTIN WOULD HAVE SAID, NO 

1103
02:54:26,688 --> 02:54:27,923
QUESTION ABOUT IT, WHEN HE SAID 

1104
02:54:27,923 --> 02:54:29,191
WE DO NOT EXPECT DIVERSE 

1105
02:54:29,191 --> 02:54:30,526
COUNTRIES TO SHARE THE SAME 

1106
02:54:30,526 --> 02:54:32,161
CULTURES, BUT WE DO EXPECT ALL 

1107
02:54:32,161 --> 02:54:34,196
NATIONS TO UPHOLD TWO CORE 

1108
02:54:34,196 --> 02:54:35,331
SOVEREIGN DUTIES, TO RESPECT THE

1109
02:54:35,331 --> 02:54:36,264
INTERESTS OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE 

1110
02:54:36,264 --> 02:54:38,500
AND THE RIGHTS OF EVERY OTHER 

1111
02:54:38,500 --> 02:54:39,301
SOVEREIGN NATION.

1112
02:54:39,301 --> 02:54:40,870
AND THERE ARE LOTS OF DICTATORS 

1113
02:54:40,870 --> 02:54:43,072
AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING 

1114
02:54:43,072 --> 02:54:45,507
VLADIMIR PUTIN WHO SAY THE SAME 

1115
02:54:45,507 --> 02:54:48,110
THING AND WILL HEAR THOSE WORDS,

1116
02:54:48,110 --> 02:54:48,744
HOWEVER PRESIDENT TRUMP MEANT 

1117
02:54:48,744 --> 02:54:49,779
THEM AS A LICENSE TO DO WHATEVER

1118
02:54:49,779 --> 02:54:51,113
THEY WANT TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE. 

1119
02:54:51,113 --> 02:54:52,815
>> THERE WAS ALSO VEILED 

1120
02:54:52,815 --> 02:54:53,682
CRITICISM OF VLADIMIR PUTIN AND 

1121
02:54:53,682 --> 02:54:55,084
CHINA WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT 

1122
02:54:55,084 --> 02:54:58,120
PRESERVING SOVEREIGNTY FROM THE 

1123
02:54:58,120 --> 02:55:00,523
UKRAINE TO THE SOUTH CHINA SEA.

1124
02:55:00,523 --> 02:55:01,657
JONATHAN KARL, NOT ONLY TOUGH 

1125
02:55:01,657 --> 02:55:03,259
WORDS FOR NORTH KOREA, ALSO 

1126
02:55:03,259 --> 02:55:03,492
IRAN.

1127
02:55:03,492 --> 02:55:04,894
THE PRESIDENT SAID DURING THE 

1128
02:55:04,894 --> 02:55:06,295
CAMPAIGN HE WANTED TO RIP UP THE

1129
02:55:06,295 --> 02:55:07,730
IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT BUT HE'S 

1130
02:55:07,730 --> 02:55:13,202
DEFENDED IT OR ACCEPTED IT TO 

1131
02:55:13,202 --> 02:55:13,402
DATE.

1132
02:55:13,402 --> 02:55:14,036
THIS MAY NOT BE THE LAST WORD. 

1133
02:55:14,036 --> 02:55:14,704
>> HE DIDN'T SAY HE WAS GOING TO

1134
02:55:14,704 --> 02:55:15,871
RIP IT UP HERE BUT HE DID SAY 

1135
02:55:15,871 --> 02:55:16,839
SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY, GEORGE.

1136
02:55:16,839 --> 02:55:18,507
HE CALLED THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL 

1137
02:55:18,507 --> 02:55:19,775
AN EMBARRASSMENT.

1138
02:55:19,775 --> 02:55:21,543
HE CALLED IT AN EMBARRASSMENT.

1139
02:55:21,543 --> 02:55:23,112
WHAT IS FASCINATING ABOUT THAT 

1140
02:55:23,112 --> 02:55:25,781
IS THIS IS AN AGREEMENT THAT WAS

1141
02:55:25,781 --> 02:55:27,350
NEGOTIATED BY THE PREVIOUS 

1142
02:55:27,350 --> 02:55:28,584
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT, BARACK 

1143
02:55:28,584 --> 02:55:29,785
OBAMA, BUT ALSO WITH OUR 

1144
02:55:29,785 --> 02:55:32,822
STRONGEST ALLIES THERE IN THAT 

1145
02:55:32,822 --> 02:55:33,022
HALL.

1146
02:55:33,022 --> 02:55:35,091
AND HE SAID THAT AGREEMENT IS AN

1147
02:55:35,091 --> 02:55:35,424
EMBARRASSMENT.

1148
02:55:35,424 --> 02:55:37,093
WE HAVE NOT HEARD THE END OF IT.

1149
02:55:37,093 --> 02:55:37,994
UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT HE WILL 

1150
02:55:37,994 --> 02:55:39,128
ULTIMATELY DO WHAT HE THREATENED

1151
02:55:39,128 --> 02:55:40,663
DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND RIP IT 

1152
02:55:40,663 --> 02:55:40,829
UP.

1153
02:55:40,829 --> 02:55:43,799
I WOULD SAY OVERALL, THIS WAS IN

1154
02:55:43,799 --> 02:55:47,569
MANY WAYS SERIOUS, SUBSTANTIVE, 

1155
02:55:47,569 --> 02:55:48,504
OFTEN POSITIVE SPEECH THAT 

1156
02:55:48,504 --> 02:55:49,739
INCLUDED AN EXTRAORDINARY 

1157
02:55:49,739 --> 02:55:49,972
THREAT.

1158
02:55:49,972 --> 02:55:52,008
I MEAN, GO BACK TO THAT NORTH 

1159
02:55:52,008 --> 02:55:54,910
KOREA, TO SAY TO TOTALLY DESTROY

1160
02:55:54,910 --> 02:55:56,212
NORTH KOREA IF WE ARE FORCED TO 

1161
02:55:56,212 --> 02:55:57,079
DEFEND OURSELVES. 

1162
02:55:57,079 --> 02:55:58,814
>> ABSOLUTE TERMS RIGHT THERE.

1163
02:55:58,814 --> 02:56:00,149
I WANT TO BRING MARTHA RADDATZ 

1164
02:56:00,149 --> 02:56:01,817
BACK IN AS WELL.

1165
02:56:01,817 --> 02:56:02,551
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS 

1166
02:56:02,551 --> 02:56:04,887
IDEA OF RIPPING UP THE IRAN 

1167
02:56:04,887 --> 02:56:06,389
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT NOT ONLY AS 

1168
02:56:06,389 --> 02:56:08,424
JON SAID THE FACT THAT OUR 

1169
02:56:08,424 --> 02:56:10,759
ALLIES SUPPORT IT BUT THE U.N. 

1170
02:56:10,759 --> 02:56:11,961
INSPECTORS SO FAR HAVE SAID THAT

1171
02:56:11,961 --> 02:56:14,897
IRAN IS ABIDING BY THAT NUCLEAR 

1172
02:56:14,897 --> 02:56:15,197
AGREEMENT. 

1173
02:56:15,197 --> 02:56:15,831
>> THEY HAVE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP

1174
02:56:15,831 --> 02:56:17,566
HAS SAID THEY ARE NOT ABIDING BY

1175
02:56:17,566 --> 02:56:19,134
THE SPIRIT OF THE AGREEMENT, SO 

1176
02:56:19,134 --> 02:56:20,636
I THINK IT'S EXACTLY AS JON 

1177
02:56:20,636 --> 02:56:20,936
SAID.

1178
02:56:20,936 --> 02:56:24,039
HE HAS UNTIL OCTOBER 15th TO 

1179
02:56:24,039 --> 02:56:26,075
DECIDE WHAT HE'LL DO ABOUT THAT 

1180
02:56:26,075 --> 02:56:26,342
AGREEMENT.

1181
02:56:26,342 --> 02:56:28,210
I THINK CERTAINLY THE IRANIANS 

1182
02:56:28,210 --> 02:56:31,113
KNOW THEY WILL BE WATCHING VERY,

1183
02:56:31,113 --> 02:56:32,415
VERY CAREFULLY IF THEY GO 

1184
02:56:32,415 --> 02:56:33,882
BEYOND, AS THEY SAY, GOING 

1185
02:56:33,882 --> 02:56:34,717
AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THE 

1186
02:56:34,717 --> 02:56:35,117
AGREEMENT.

1187
02:56:35,117 --> 02:56:36,752
BUT, GEORGE, I WANT TO GO BACK 

1188
02:56:36,752 --> 02:56:39,121
AGAIN JUST QUICKLY TO THAT NORTH

1189
02:56:39,121 --> 02:56:40,823
KOREA STATEMENT.

1190
02:56:40,823 --> 02:56:41,490
PEOPLE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE 

1191
02:56:41,490 --> 02:56:44,626
IS A MILITARY OPTION THE UNITED 

1192
02:56:44,626 --> 02:56:46,062
STATES COULD DESTROY NORTH 

1193
02:56:46,062 --> 02:56:48,230
KOREA, BUT NOT WITHOUT A GREAT 

1194
02:56:48,230 --> 02:56:51,066
LOSS OF LIFE IN SOUTH KOREA AND 

1195
02:56:51,066 --> 02:56:53,235
POSSIBLY TO U.S. FORCES AS WELL.

1196
02:56:53,235 --> 02:56:54,436
THIS IS A VERY BIG THREAT HE 

1197
02:56:54,436 --> 02:56:54,636
MADE. 

1198
02:56:54,636 --> 02:56:57,573
>> I WANT TO FOLLOW THAT UP WITH

1199
02:56:57,573 --> 02:56:58,574
TERRY MORAN AS WELL.

1200
02:56:58,574 --> 02:57:00,509
IF YOU READ THE PRESIDENT'S 

1201
02:57:00,509 --> 02:57:01,877
WORDS, HE SAID THE CONDITIONS 

1202
02:57:01,877 --> 02:57:02,978
WOULD BE A FORCE TO DEFEND 

1203
02:57:02,978 --> 02:57:05,114
OURSELVES AND OUR ALLIES.

1204
02:57:05,114 --> 02:57:05,981
YOU CAN READ THAT POSSIBLY TO 

1205
02:57:05,981 --> 02:57:08,884
EVEN OPEN UP A JUSTIFICATION FOR

1206
02:57:08,884 --> 02:57:11,153
PREVENTATIVE WAR AGAINST NORTH 

1207
02:57:11,153 --> 02:57:11,487
KOREA.

1208
02:57:11,487 --> 02:57:12,521
>> THAT IS A POTENTIAL 

1209
02:57:12,521 --> 02:57:14,823
JUSTIFICATION, BUT THE WORDS 

1210
02:57:14,823 --> 02:57:16,492
TOTALLY DESTROYING A NATION OF 

1211
02:57:16,492 --> 02:57:17,726
25 MILLION PEOPLE, THAT BORDERS 

1212
02:57:17,726 --> 02:57:20,829
ON THE THREAT OF COMMITTING A 

1213
02:57:20,829 --> 02:57:21,296
WAR CRIME.

1214
02:57:21,296 --> 02:57:22,431
>> THAT IS GOING TO BE THE LAST 

1215
02:57:22,431 --> 02:57:25,835
WORD FOR US RIGHT NOW.

1216
02:57:25,835 --> 02:57:26,402
EXTRAORDINARY SPEECH FROM 

1217
02:57:26,402 --> 02:57:28,237
