00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,139
out I want your opinion on something I

95
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:08,230
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like the philosophy of you</font>

96
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,239
dish out the punishment at the time of

97
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,819
the crime and the punishment has to go

98
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,639
with what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the crime is I mean are you so</font>

99
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,950
yeah Nick<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're deep trouble</font>

100
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:27,570
you're cut off no okay anyways so I like

101
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,210
I strongly feel that it needs to go like

102
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,920
punishment goes with the crime so if

103
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,290
it's something related to food then

104
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,060
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take away their toys like it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>
