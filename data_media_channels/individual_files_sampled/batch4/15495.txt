what method you're a student of this you've written extensively about this very subject what message does recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and opening the u.s. embassy in Jerusalem send to the global community well correct so first of all in 1995 Congress actually passed the Jerusalem embassy act and so you know we basically been promising to do this for quite some time Trump is the first person who's actually made good on that promise and here's what's very important to note anyone who has followed history has known that Israel has repeatedly tried to make concessions for peace right whether it was the you know the Camp David negotiations and and when Hood Barak offered basically Arafat pretty much everything he wanted and he rejected the deal and even Saudi prince Bandar I believe it was blamed Arafat for the ensuing violence that happened after that escalation and after that rejection of peace so this has happened repeatedly one of the other things to note is that it isn't just about Jerusalem right it the idea whether it's it's Hamas and in their charter from the river to the sea Palestine will be free this isn't just about them wanting Jerusalem they want all of Israel and they want the Jewish people dead and wiped off the face of the man Iran that wants the Shia Crescent they want to essentially Iran is a nation-state is essentially picking up or Isis left off when we crush them and now they're trying to create their own eventually Caliphate right by carving from Syria eradicating Israel existing Hezbollah and taking over Lebanon which is a move to free you know Hezbollah in Lebanon you know there is no there is no differentiation there yeah but now Hezbollah is officially going to control Lebanon we they've always controlled them by force and with proxies but now with these pickups and me legislature they're in Parliament it looks like they're gonna actually have standing as legitimate political figures correct now what this embassy move does is show the world like look we have been conceding we have been trying to offer peace you know from the get-go and America as Israel's ally has kind of you know obviously been supportive depending on the administration you know george w bush was was a great israel supporter obama was not i don't think he you know israel's had a better friend than trump i mean a lot of people thought you know GW was incredibly pro-israel and in retrospect you know we definitely see some moves that the bush administration made that we're not in Israel's best interest but this is because it tells the world and it signals to the arab world in a rod and its proxies more specifically that we mean business America does have Israel's back and Jerusalem is the undivided capital of the Jewish state I want to keep bringing you this content each and every day these are really important stories help me do that by subscribing to our premium service at WWWE a forward slash shows also go to the App Store download the great rebel app so I get all my content and go to fire Scott Israel dot-com sign our petition we want Florida Governor Rick Scott to remove incompetent Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel as always thanks for doing those things and thank you so much for watching I'll be with you tomorrow
