HISTORIC SUMMIT.

5
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:25,291
THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SAYS IT

6
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:25,958
IS ALL ABOUT ATTITUDE, NOT

7
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:26,359
PREPARATION.

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,093
WHAT ATTITUDE DOES HE NEED FOR A

9
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:27,793
MEETING WITH AN UNPREDICTABLE

10
00:00:27,793 --> 00:00:37,236

17
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,541
THAT IS A BIG QUESTION.

18
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,275
HOW DO YOU PREPARE FOR MEETING

19
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:42,775
WITH KIM JONG UN.

20
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:53,186
WHEN THE PRES. SAYS IT IS

21
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:55,188
WITH KIM JONG UN.
WHEN THE PRES. SAYS IT IS ALL

22
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,022
ABOUT ATTITUDE, WHAT TYPE OF

23
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:56,589
ATTITUDE DO YOU NEED?

24
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,190
>> YOU NEED TO PROJECT

25
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:57,924
CONFIDENCE AND THAT IS WHAT THE

26
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:58,457
PRESIDENT IS DOING.

27
00:00:58,457 --> 00:00:59,158
WHEN HE SAYS IT IS ALL ABOUT

28
00:00:59,158 --> 00:00:59,792
ATTITUDE HE IS PROJECTING

29
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:00,459
CONFIDENCE WHICH IS WHAT HE

30
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:00,927
SHOULD BE DOING.

31
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:01,661
SECRETARY OF STATE KIM JONG UN

32
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:02,395
HAD A WONDERFUL PRESS CONFERENCE

33
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,095
AFTER THE PRESIDENT HAD THIS

34
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:03,763
PRESS CONFERENCE WITH THE

35
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:04,497
JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER IN WHICH

36
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:04,530
HE

37
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:16,709
DONALD TRUMP HAS

38
00:01:20,112 --> 00:01:21,214
DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN HAVING

39
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:21,914
HOURS OF BRIEFINGS SO DONALD

40
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:22,582
TRUMP IS VERY WELL PREPARED.

41
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,282
HE KNOWS ALL THE INFORMATION,

42
00:01:23,282 --> 00:01:23,950
UNDERSTANDS WITH THE NORTH

43
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,684
KOREANS WILL TRY TO DO HERE AND

44
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:25,418
KNOWS WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR SO

45
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,152
IT IS POINT HE NEEDS TO GO AND

46
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:26,886
PROJECT CONFIDENCE, BE PREPARED

47
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:27,620
TO WALK OUT IF THE NORTH KOREANS

48
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,321
DECIDE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO

49
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:38,364
PLAY

50
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:46,772
IN EARNEST.

51
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:47,506
I AM PRETTY CONFIDENT GOING INTO

52
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:48,241
THIS WEEKEND AND THE NEXT WEEK

53
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:48,975
TO SEE WHAT DONALD TRUMP CAN GET

54
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:49,275
DONE.

55
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,009
>> TALKED ABOUT WILLINGNESS TO

56
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:50,743
GET THINGS DONE BUT DO YOU THINK

57
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:51,444
ON THEIR PART KIM JONG UN IS

58
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,111
WILLING TO GET THINGS DONE.

59
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:52,845
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY SIGNS OF THAT

60
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:53,512
ASIDE FROM AGREEING TO THIS

61
00:01:53,512 --> 00:01:53,846
MEETING.

62
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:54,580
>> I REMAIN COMPLETELY SKEPTICAL

63
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,652
OF THE NORTH KOREANS.

64
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:00,386
I THINK KIM JONG UN IS LOOKING

65
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:01,120
FOR THINGS TO SECURE FOR HIS OWN

66
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,454
COUNTRY.

67
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,188
I DON'T THINK THE NORTH KOREANS

68
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,590
ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING RID OF

69
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,224
THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS BUT

70
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:05,958
BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS SUCH AN

71
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,994
UNCONVENTIONAL PRES. AND IS SO

72
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:12,064
COMMITTED TO RESULTS, HE'S NOT

73
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:15,034
IDEOLOGICAL, THINGS LIKE THIS,

74
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,702
COMPLEMENTING HIM AND EXTENDING

75
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:17,436
THIS DIPLOMATIC OVERTURE TO HIM

76
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:20,673
THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN FROM AN

77
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:21,407
AMERICAN PRESIDENT MAYBE HE CAN

78
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:28,314
PULL SOMETHING OFF AND GIVE HIM

79
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,015
SOMETHING THAT WOULD PERSUADE

80
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:29,749
HIM THAT IT WOULD BE WORTH THE

81
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:30,049
COST.

82
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:30,783
>> I SAID ALL ALONG I THINK KIM

83
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,184
JONG UN ACTUALLY LOOKS UP TO

84
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:32,618
DONALD TRUMP.

85
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:34,153
I THINK HE RESPECTS HIS

86
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:40,726
UNCONVENTIONAL STYLE SO WE WILL

87
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:41,460
SEE IF THAT BENEFITS US IN THESE

88
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,194
NEGOTIATIONS MOVING FORWARD BUT

89
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:46,365
IN THE MEANTIME THE PRESIDENT

90
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:46,899
HEADED FIRST TO THE

91
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:47,633
TODD: SUMMIT WITH TARIFF TALKS,

92
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:49,268
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT AS THE

93
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:52,605
PRESIDENT HEADS TO CANADA TODAY?

94
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:53,339
>> DONALD TRUMP, THE TWEETS HE

95
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:59,245
SENT OUT YESTERDAY WHERE HE WAS

96
00:02:59,245 --> 00:02:59,912
GIVING MACROAND A HARD TIME

97
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:00,613
ADJUSTING TO DO A HARD TIME,

98
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:09,655
THIS IS SOMETHING HE DOES, HE IS

99
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:10,256
NOT AFRAID TO MIX IT UP.

100
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:10,923
I'M NOT A BIG SUPPORTER OF

101
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:11,624
PUTTING THESE TARIFFS ON OUR

102
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:12,325
CLOSEST ALLIES BUT I'M NOT AN

103
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:12,992
ECONOMIST SO I DON'T HAVE A

104
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:13,726
SUPERSTRONG OPINION ABOUT THIS.

105
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:14,460
OTHERS NO MORE ABOUT IT BUT WHAT

106
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,864
I APPRECIATE HIS DONALD TRUMP

107
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:19,598
DOESN'T SEE THE ISSUES HE CAN'T

108
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:20,333
TOUCH OR CAN'T SAY THAT I CAN'T

109
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:20,666
DO THAT.

110
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:30,676
IS

111
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:33,813
DO THAT.
IS WILLING TO MIX IT UP AND

112
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:34,680
THESE ALLIANCES ARE STRONG AND

113
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,414
SO I THINK IN THE END YOU WILL

114
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:36,115
SEE THESE ALLIANCES THAT WILL

115
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:36,816
WEATHER THIS STORM, THEY WILL

116
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:37,516
COOPERATE AND PLAY BALL WITH

117
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:38,217
DONALD TRUMP AND WE WILL HAVE

118
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:38,951
STRONGER ALLIANCES BY THE END OF

119
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:39,685
HIS FIRST TERM IF HE DOES HAVE A

120
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:40,019
SECOND.

121
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:40,119
>> HE

122
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:47,259
POLITICALLY CORRECT SPEECH.

123
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:47,960
LET'S LOOK AT THE TWEETS YOU

124
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,694
WERE MENTIONING THAT HE TALKED

125
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:49,362
ABOUT, ONE ABOUT THE UNFAIR

126
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:49,662
TRADE.

127
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:58,604
WE CAN PULL THAT UP AND YOU

128
00:03:58,604 --> 00:03:59,338
MENTIONED HE TALKS ABOUT HOW WE

129
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:00,039
NEED TO FIX THAT AND IT WOULD

130
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,773
BENEFIT US, YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT

131
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:01,073
THERE.

132
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:01,741
>> I APPRECIATE THE FACT, I

133
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,475
CHUCKLE WHEN I SEE THE SWEETS.

134
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,209
A LOT OF PEOPLE GET REALLY UPSET

135
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:08,481
AND WORKS UP AND THINK THESE

136
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,215
ALLIANCES ARE GOING TO BE RUINED

137
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:09,915
AND I THINK THAT IS NONSENSE,

138
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:15,821
DONALD TRUMP, THESE ALLIANCES

139
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:16,555
ARE STRONG, HE -- THERE IS SPACE

140
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:17,223
TO PUSH BACK AND SAY THESE

141
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:17,957
ALLIANCES ARE STRONG AND I WANT

142
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:24,196
A BETTER TRADE DEAL FOR

143
00:04:24,196 --> 00:04:24,897
AMERICANS BECAUSE I'M HERE TO

144
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:25,364
REPRESENT THEM.

145
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:26,065
I'M NOT HERE TO REPRESENT YOU.

146
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:26,665
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN

147
00:04:26,665 --> 00:00:00,000
APPRECIATE THAT.
