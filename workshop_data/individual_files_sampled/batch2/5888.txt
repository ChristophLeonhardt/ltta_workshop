want to get to Cal Perry now he is in Tornillo Texas and for those of you who have been following our coverage you'll know that Cal has been trying to to get into one of these facilities for days now and cows I understand it you just ran out you just stepped out of a tour of the facility there one of these tent cities what can you tell us what did you see all right Greg so we've just gotten some clarification I'm sorry someone's in my ear we've just come out of our first tour of the tourney attempt facility which of course has been a lot of attention on this facility here's the breakdown of the kids inside there are three hundred and twenty six children inside that camp right now 14 are girls twenty-three of the kids inside that camp were separated from their families here's a breakdown of where they're from 117 from Honduras 40 from El Salvador 162 from Guatemala 3 from Mexico and 4 from other countries we spent two hours inside Craig we were given a full tour of the facility after a briefing the headline for me and Joyce here as well I think was the emergency manager who works for a company called B CFS said the following to the media these are direct quotes quote the shelter would not have been necessary without the separations quote the crisis was made as a result of the decision to separate in the kids quote separations should never have happened the process is flawed he said and it harmed the children he said that he would like to never do this again we then toured the facility there are 22 tents on this facility two are set aside for girls and there are how many girls joy I apologize I'm just going through my notes here 14 14 girls I apologize in these tents Craig and we saw the kids the kids are walked around as groups by their tents so 20 kids at a time they're led all the time by two of the quote unquote teachers of the officials they're wearing sort of yellow t-shirts they they walk these kids around in a line we were able to only interact on a very basic level with them hello how are you doing we were told not to interact any further with those kids they all seemed fairly happy going into those tents was pretty emotional there are drawings of kids that they've done one said I am one percent Honduran and I walk 10,000 miles to get here this facility is on a 30-day contract by the US government that contract began 11 days ago and will end on July the 13th throughout the tour we were accompanied by the spokesperson for HHS he talked about not knowing whether or not they would extend that contract it depends on whether or not there's a need this facility Craig is a spillover area the facility was created because joy they're moving some of the tender age children around the country right and the point was made to us Craig that the facility would not have been necessary had they not had to make room for much younger children at these facilities where they're moving kids to around the country and this is both small unaccompanied kids they even leave and we're told that some children arrived with phone numbers of relatives pinned on them but the majority of these tender age children are on accompany because let's make it very clear they were separated from their parents and when they get moved into facilities that are appropriate for a much younger child then a bed needs to be freed up for them the facility that we were in was not appropriate for those little kids so those older kids get moved to a facility like this twenty-six of the children inside that facility I'm sorry Craig good no I gotta mean catch up but I did use all that folks know that the images they were seeing at home those were images that have been provided to us by the government those are images from from HHS but go ahead go ahead you were saying something Cal yeah 26 of the children in that camp were separated from their families three have already been reunited look the thing that didn't make sense about the visit and I and I do want to say that access to this facility has made a great deal of difference the the emergency manager said it was the secrecy about this policy that has caused so much trouble he's urging frankly the government to allow more press access to the facility the one thing that that didn't make sense to me a joy is you know we talked about how to track down the kids and the spokesperson for HHS says they know where all the kids are with the families yeah and it took a long time for us to actually get onto the tour because there were a lot of questions coming from us in the press as to how you match the right child with the parent they're saying that each child is given what's called an a number that this number follows the child throughout the system what we were told is that even if the parent and the child are physically separated they have numbers of course bond to one another they insisted that they know where every child is and that they're making every effort to either reunite the child with their parent or with another relative in the u.s. they say that there's a process that they're trying to get through one thing that we were told by the HHS spokesperson that I thought was significant was we don't do families we only deal with children so we are not clear at all what happens when this policy of child and parent separation becomes a policy of family detention we don't know whether or not an HHS spokesperson like the one we spoke to today is going to be able to talk to us and tell us what's happening we don't know if the process is going to change those are the questions we couldn't get answered today because again this facility is literally only there to deal with 13 to 17 year old teenagers Cal I know that joy can't hear me so can you relay the question what struck her most about the tour what struck her most as she was walking through those those tents yeah Craig's asking what struck you the most before I get you in there I'll tell you the kids playing soccer these are tough kids they came tens of thousands of miles I mean they're 14 years old but they look older and tougher and Craig's asking what struck out too you know I guess somebody that has you know two sons they they really did I you know I sort of transported me back to when my boys from particular were teenagers you know at that age teenage boys don't talk a lot right they're very reserved a lot of the boys smiled at us they wanted to say hello those who could speak English would wanted to speak English with us wanted to tell us hello the only questions that we were able to ask them we couldn't ask them anything about themselves was how are you doing how is the food they were very eager to answer those questions we saw kids lining up to use the phone facilities to call relatives we saw kids sort of lined up outside doing their activities going from activity to activity and what really you know I don't know there was something about it that had a pathos to it these are kids who are alone because they are teenagers and they're boys they're all together they're playing soccer together they seem to be making friends with one a lot of them did smile but there were some of them who didn't who just had to sort of a blank expression on their face who seemed a little bit distant a little bit vacant and it had to be strange for them to sort of be gawked at by us it was a bit almost we were sort of a spectator looking at them and they were sort of behind the zoo gates in a way really and we could really couldn't communicate who we were why we were there that we were given this this schedule and it I don't think consumed and we were given this schedule and it looks like a looks like it scheduled that you would see at a daycare centre or anywhere else you know outdoor recreation shower time lunchtime there allowed two phone calls a week ten minutes in length somebody is there for that phone call we were told that was you know to make sure that there's no child endangerment issues right not to monitor the phone calls they were playing soccer Craig apparently that is the thing that they they enjoy doing the most there's a 90 degree cut off 90 degree he tend to index cut off where they then will will bring them back inside they are allowing the kids to watch the World Cup live in there I know it's some facilities they don't but yeah and Karen curricular just like one more thing that struck me and I'm sure it struck you too Cal we went into the sleeping tent it's a very militaristic environment okay if you feel like you're inside of an army barrack it feels like a Forward Operating Base absolutely in any of these military-style tents are sleeping in these bunk beds where all the beds are perfectly made up it's very sort of like military camp in a way but there are these little touches that the kids have put inside of their own tents these little drawings that are done in crayon and sort of colourful crayon that was one there was sort of a crucifix with a rose at the top of it there are others that have sort of affirmative sort of positive sayings the one that Cowell mentioned about how far one young person had come from Honduras you know these are sort of ways that these kids are trying to express themselves that was tough and we really only were allowed to talk with two girls the girls are very much secretary gated and separated from the boys the girls were very reticent they were very different in a way from the boys like not they didn't want they the boys were very kind of eager to wave and thumbs up and talk about the World Cup and what team they're playing for and the girls they came out individually two girls one at a time just to sort of let us know that they were okay it was clear that again this this dynamic of being sort of Lear dad yes like in a better term was sort of freaking them out yeah and we were told that when the congressional delegation came through it did sort of frighten some of the kids being peppered with questions so they were very restrictive about what we could ask them and you know it's difficult just as a parent to see one of the things that moved me was we were told that the kids as they leave as the transfer to other facilities they're leaving there's a very few belongings they have behind for the kids they know they're gonna be coming behind them correct I know you guys have to get to this sort of briefing that's being offered by Health and Human Services I'll let you go do that if there's some news may do come back joy thanks as always Cal Perry a big thanks to
