00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,019
hey youtube so i recently got to test

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,480
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> l'or√©al's ever cruel line it's a</font>

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,519
guess it's relatively new<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm assuming</font>

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,650
because I got to test it so i'm assuming

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,980
to you um i tested for products from

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,630
this line I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> touch the shampoo</font>

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,810
because I don't don't give me shampoo

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,090
because I'm not gonna put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on my head</font>

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just not going to do that</font>

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,099
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know so I didn't does</font>

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,019
the shampoo because I'm not even about

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,750
that life um but it tested everything

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,570
else so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tested their leave in cream</font>

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay i tested their a sculpting hold gel</font>

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,510
cream Joe okay um<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tested their</font>

16
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,640
cleansing conditioner I don't know if

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,770
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a pump you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,570
that cleansing conditioner this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my</font>

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,520
computer I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to set up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,350
camera camera because I'm just sometimes

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,329
I just am not feeling it and then I

22
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,430
tested their regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> or just their</font>

23
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,720
conditioner um so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just go through</font>

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,430
the regimen of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tested all of this</font>

25
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,340
i use the conditioner to detangle that

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,350
being said<font color="#E5E5E5"> i really liked this</font>

27
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,070
conditioner as a detangling agent um it

28
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,900
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it provided a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,830
slip I could easily like detangle I've

30
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,090
just recently gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> to finger</font>

31
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,210
detangling and this was like I'm I want

32
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,520
to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> this just for that because it</font>

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,680
was great um and then so after<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,780
fingered he tangled and all of that they

35
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,250
kind of like let it sit for a while

36
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,810
because it's conditioner you know let<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

37
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,329
sit why not I then went into the shower

38
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,899
and cleansed with their cleansing

39
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,189
conditioner so this is basically

40
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,970
supposed to be a conditioner but it has

41
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">some kind of cleansing agents in it to</font>

42
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,240
help like get stuff off your scalp but

43
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,899
in a soft and nice way um so with this

44
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:10,179
mmm<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know I mean it got my head</font>

45
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:14,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean but it still felt too strong like</font>

46
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:16,989
after I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the shower and washing</font>

47
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:18,459
and it says you don't need to use

48
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:19,840
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else after this it's kind of</font>

49
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,439
like a whole two and one thing with

50
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,640
what's that come with like head and

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">shoulders and shoulders big thing they</font>

52
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,290
have like two and one you know it's like

53
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just need to use one thing like my</font>

54
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,980
husband he just uses that on his head

55
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,329
every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> day but you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

56
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:39,129
that's a wholly different argument but

57
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:41,950
anyway so it's tight I feel like that's

58
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">what this was supposed to be and it</font>

59
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:46,780
wasn't that I got out the shower and I

60
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,989
still felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> like all the lovingness that</font>

61
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:53,349
this has given<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I lost it is not gone</font>

62
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,340
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> still too strong which is why</font>

63
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,049
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't believe in shampoo anyway so</font>

64
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:04,959
that's that and so then I followed up I

65
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,750
did my little I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> little twists on my</font>

66
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,310
head as like my protective style and I

67
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,069
kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> her bantu knot twists and so I used</font>

68
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:15,459
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave in cream for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and just a</font>

69
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,810
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of jail a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit Jill and</font>

70
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,359
the leave in cream it felt too light to

71
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:24,010
me when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting it on because I</font>

72
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,590
have my own little DIY cream that I've

73
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,030
made<font color="#CCCCCC"> with coconut oil and shea butter</font>

74
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,459
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has aloe vera gel in it vitamin e</font>

75
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:35,229
oil likes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold it's just a plethora</font>

76
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:39,790
of moisturizing agents um so compared to

77
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,540
that this felt very light which is for

78
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,370
people with the four C's my four C's

79
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,870
where you add that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little scary when</font>

80
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,849
you put on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cream and it feels light</font>

81
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:52,629
you're like this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna this isn't</font>

82
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:58,239
gonna last me very long oh but to its to

83
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,569
its merit it did moisturize my hair and

84
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:07,720
seal relatively well to the same degree

85
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,650
as my home cream no but considering

86
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,509
that's a lot lighter it did a really

87
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:16,238
good job so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not the DIY kind</font>

88
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,219
of person like I am for the most part

89
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:22,419
becoming um and you have a you know much

90
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:23,590
quarter kinky

91
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,820
your texture of hair like if you're in

92
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,320
the 4b 4c I'd give it a try um it wasn't

93
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,919
horrible it wasn't horrible and and and

94
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the whole line has a lovely like floral</font>

95
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,410
scent to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's synthetic but a floral</font>

96
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,610
synthetic nonetheless so try it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out it</font>

97
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,240
smells nice um sculpted hold cream gel I

98
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,750
don't really I didn't really notice when

99
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,300
i took my<font color="#E5E5E5"> hair down the ones that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i did</font>

100
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,600
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on didn't hold any better than if i</font>

101
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,130
didn't use this so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know as a</font>

102
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,169
whole I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this entire line of</font>

103
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:08,919
product is good for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people with a loser</font>

104
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,930
curl pattern or like a wavy or curly

105
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,630
like I'm actually planning on sending

106
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,770
all of this to my friend in San Antonio

107
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">who has I would say she's in the threes</font>

108
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,229
I think this would be a great line for

109
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:27,130
the three a through C group I really

110
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,110
like just knowing how this product works

111
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,460
and like yeah I think three a through C

112
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,200
3 a through 3c try this line out but for

113
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,680
me all I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take from it with</font>

114
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,320
love just when I don't feel like making

115
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,070
stuff is the conditioner to detangle

116
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,560
I'll keep this guy not sending her this

117
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,490
because I want this and um I'll probably

118
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,590
keep the leave-in actually knock<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

119
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,050

120
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,520

123
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">rest of it i'm just going to send to her</font>

124
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,710
cuz i think she'll really i think this

125
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">will work wonders on her head honestly</font>

126
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:23,950
well for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> foresees yeah but once</font>

again i love<font color="#E5E5E5"> the smell though like I</font>

128
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,810
could harness yeah it's really nice it's

129
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,030
very floral you know like you're walking

130
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,370
