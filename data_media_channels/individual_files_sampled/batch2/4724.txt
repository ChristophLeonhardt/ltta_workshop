I want to talk about this bombshell report revealing the Trump administration actually has drafted new legislation to essentially walk away from the World Trade Organization the WTO Axios obtained a leaked draft of the bill that quote essentially provides Trump a license to raise US tariffs at will without congressional consent and international rules be damned and ignores its most basic principles NBC has not yet seen a draft of this bill but joining me now is someone who has xes White House reporter Elena Train hey Elena so tell us about this again we have not seen it you have what more does this draft call for well I think the most important thing to point out from the start is that the president has absolute contempt for the World Trade Organization he thinks it's stacked against the u.s. he thinks it's unfair and most of all he thinks it's an inconvenient global institution keeping him from what he really wants to do which is negotiate with different countries one on one and have the power without congressional oversight to implement tariffs one on one and some of the things that we're seeing here from this draft bill are two of the key principles of the World Trade Organization which is the most favored nation principle which shows that there should be trade without discrimination the president wants to do with way with that as well as this this border broad tariff agreement which is basically it implements ceilings on how much different countries within the world of trade organization can implement these terms yes your reporting is that the president wanted this done so what are you hearing from inside the White House inside his economic team is this them well let's put this together he says he wants it we'll give it to him it's never gonna pass or is there some sense this could actually be reality they don't think it'll pass at least most of them apart from Peter Navarro his trade adviser we actually have reporting that mark short the legislative affairs director had told Peter Navarro a few months back when they were discussing this bill that this is dead on arrival there's zero chance Congress would ever pass this they don't know they already think he has too much broad authority on implementing implementing different trade agreements now they don't want to give him more authority to continue doing that but this is something that the president has wanted for months he secretly and privately been talking with his aides about fixing this what he sees as unfair and unbalanced trade with different countries I mean this is a guy dumb who got elected in large part you know with this economic message and that I heard it certainly when I was out on a campaign trail all the time he's a businessman he's gonna fix our economic problems he has shown a lack of understanding about how trade works how tariffs work and I believe isn't sure that the rules he's actually trying to void have helped lower tariffs and protect US trade what if anything could he be trying to gain in passing a bill like this other than autonomy to do what he wants to do when he wants to do it well that's a real issue right now whether or not this is going to be some kind of sabre-rattling whether or not the leaked document there was in any way meant to kind of catalyze or evoke a response in some way from other other negotiating parties that were with right now the issue is whether or not he has the advisors around him President Trump does that are going to pretty much show him that this could be a real path towards at least a downside for the US economy and when I say that remember at the beginning in his first year in office President Trump had that big council of business leaders all of these CEOs that was later disbanded one of the people on there was GM CEO Mary Barra who just now walk away pretty much right I mean so they disbanded they walked away well however you want to spin it these CEOs were the ones who are trying to advise President Trump on some of the business implications here when GM comes out and says that if you have trade and tariff policy as it stands right now or going forward you will see a smaller General Motors in America and we're talking about a cut a company that has 47 plants at 110,000 employees in America that's a big deal and then you got the Business Roundtable right and all those groups speaking out the US Chamber of Commerce today is unveiling a new campaign to go after president Trump's trade policies because in the end they say it will cost us consumers and that's going to be something that it's really strange to see groups like the the Chamber of Commerce at odds with the president with the Republican Party because they are seen as business-friendly so to see that kind of thing happened really does evoke some kind of an interesting response from a lot of people out there well you got a president who's still going after an American company by the name of
