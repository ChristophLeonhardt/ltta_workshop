law enforcement is actively spying on dissidents who are trying to improve the system take a look at this the Massachusetts State Police accidentally revealed surveillance of progressive political groups in a social media post on gas explosions in Lawrence North Andover and Andover WBUR reports the police posted an image of 39 gas explosion locations but the screen grab of the police computer indicated the browser's a bookmarks bar the post showed police had booked pages for Massachusetts action against police brutality the coalition to organize and mobilize Boston against Trump and other activists organizations police were also monitoring a resistance calendar of anti Trump protests Cade Crockford director of the Technology Director of the technology for liberty program at the Massachusetts branch of the ACLU slammed the revelation I wasn't surprised but I was appalled Crockford told WB you are American law enforcement has for a very long time targeted dissidents a lot of people like to believe those tactics ended but that's not true and actually after 9/11 they've seen a substantial resurgence so this is a stark reminder of what law enforcement has traditionally done in this country they spied on Malcolm X Martin Luther King and they tried to ruin them remember it was the FBI that famously sent a letter to Martin Luther King saying we know about your fare you should kill yourself Malcolm X they tried to find similar dirt but it turns out he was not cheating on his wife so they didn't have anything in that respect but he also ended in his life ended in a assassination it's it's an open question as to whether or not it was actually they say it was definitely the Nation of Islam that that did the hit some people even say Louis Farrakhan but I don't know who it is all I know is there's a question as to whether to them or could be you know our law enforcement agencies but there's a history of spying on dissidents and people who try not you know implement social change and what's super annoying is that later on everybody pretends like with Martin Luther King Day like oh yeah we Martin Luther King's a hero and the implication is we always knew he was a hero and he was always heralded that way in society and that is not true that is not true for the longest time he was despised and you see a lot and the idea like oh we stopped all that not true they're still spying on people trying to implement social change and they're doing it because they don't agree with the social change so is there a real law enforcement imperative to to try and a fight against a group that wants to end police brutality and that wants to mobilize against Trump there's no real law enforcement imperative there but they're doing it because they're essentially an arm of the state and their political actors so it's it's a very very scary thing we saw the same Occupy Wall Street for example they viciously crackdown on those protesters and they were acting as an arm of not only the state in that instance but corporate America they were acting as an arm of the moneyed interests that's what they were doing and this is the stuff that still goes on and if you don't believe me just stop and take a minute and look at how for example Edward Snowden is treated to treated today Edward Snowden is a hero he's the guy that let us know oh by the way your government spying on you and they're doing it without a warrant and that's totally unconstitutional and that's wrong I'm gonna give you that information and then even to this day you know the narrative from the establishment is oh my god he's evil he's bad he's a traitor he's treasonous he's wrong meanwhile the you know you can draw a line between what Daniel Ellsberg did and what Edward Snowden did Daniel Ellsberg today because he released the Pentagon Papers that showed how we were massacring innocent people in Vietnam but today everybody goes oh Daniels buries a hero well Snowden did a similar thing he's a whistleblower similar very similar thing and Ellsberg says Snowden is like me but today because it's today everybody has to the establishment pretends like no he's a bad guy by the same token you know you could have the next MLK in one of these groups fighting against police brutality fighting against or mobilizing against Trump and they're spying on them and they're trying to take them down so I'm just here to give you the information I'm here to give you the facts and you do with it what you may but unfortunately these organizations are not apolitical even though they should be and when I say these organizations I mean law enforcement
