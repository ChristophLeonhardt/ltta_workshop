- Today we're gonna make
the most dangerous toys
of all time.
(thumps)
(screams)
Is it bad, is it bad, is it bad?
Oh my god.
Hello, guys.
Today, as you can tell by
the title, we're gonna be
getting kids toys and
making them dangerous.
Hopefully, you guys are
really, really excited,
but just before we start
I want to talk to you
about a really cool app that
could help you out a lot.
Now, the app is called
AppBounty and it's available
on Google Play and iPhone.
The app basically allows
you to earn money.
Yes, real money, by
downloading applications.
You can spend your money
on iTunes codes, vouchers,
Amazon codes, literally
there's so much choice.
You guys know I'd only
promote an app if I love it
and I used to use this
app a lot to get Pokecoins
back when Pokemon Go was, you know, alive.
(beeps)
Now, the way you sign up
is going to appbounty.net
and they'll say do you
want to use an invite code?
There, you'll want to use my invite code
which is (crickets chirping).
-  Morgz.
- She got it right.
-  Whoa.
- Morgz.
Then, once you go into
the app, you'll be greeted
with a screen which will show
you all of the available apps
where you can earn yourself points.
Most of the apps will
literally just ask you
to download the app
and then start the app.
That's it and you'll earn points.
Once you get enough points,
you can then spend them
on the stuff I mentioned earlier.
It's pretty cool.
So if you've got a
favourite app or just want
to earn a little bit of
money by downloading apps
through your phone,
this is completely free
and you should definitely do it.
There'll be a link in the description,
so go download the app after
you've watched the video.
But guys, I think it's
about time we get started
with the most dangerous toys of all time.
-  I'm ready!
- So as you can see
down here on the table,
we have loads of different weapons.
They're not really weapons,
but we're gonna turn them into weapons.
(claps)
We've got these really
sharp wooden spikes.
We've got massive paper clips.
We've got really sharp
nails and then we've got
some of these multi-colored
pin, thumbtack thingies.
Don't really know what you call 'em.
- Oh, well done.
- Then, here we have a
freaking hot glue gun.
I feel like I'm in some sort
of science lesson right now.
Then, you may have noticed behind me
we have loads of different toy guns
which we're gonna make a
little bit more deadly.
We've got a small one, a
medium one, a large one,
and then a frickin' extra-large one.
That one is extra-large
like fat Morgz's stomach,
like, man, that's a big one there.
Oh, yeah.
We've also got some fidget spinners.
(snaps)
That really was kind of anticlimactic.
(slapping)
Now, you guys know I love
giving back to you guys,
so in this video right here
we're gonna do a giveaway.
I'm gonna be giving away this nail.
-  Wait, are you joking, Morgan?
- Of course, of course I'm joking.
Guys, in this video I'm
gonna be giving away four,
that was three,
four 25-pound vouchers.
Gonna be giving away two
25-pound iTunes vouchers
and two 25-pound Google Play vouchers.
Now, the way you actually
enter this giveaway
is a little bit different
than the other ones.
Basically, throughout this
video, this picture of my face
is gonna keep appearing on the screen.
Basically, what you have to do
is count the amount of times
that picture appears on the
screen and then comment it
in the comment section below.
Also, leave a like on
this video down below.

and subscribe to my channel
if you are new.
That's all you have to do:
count the faces, leave
a like, and subscribe.
Guys, let's get started
with the first toy.
Now, the first one I'm gonna
do is this one right here.
You may be thinking it looks quite small,
but in the last video
we did, the small ones
actually performed better
than the bigger ones.
I think we're gonna have a little bit
of a surprise with this one.
-  It's not always
about size, Morgan.
- It's not always about size.
It's about what you can
do with it, isn't it, Mum?
That's what I keep telling myself anyway.
(beeps)
Okay, guys, we've got a knife.
I'm gonna cut into this thing.
-  Of course we've got a knife.
- Of course we've got a knife.
-  We can't video without a knife.
- It's a Morgz video.
(dings)
There we go, we've got a little blaster.
Literally, pull it back, bang to shoot.
Now, let's rip this open
and get the bullets.
-  It's like Christmas, Morgan.
- Why did Nerf make it so
hard to open the dumb toy?
I'm a 15-year-old guy and
I can't even open a box.
Do you know what we do,
Mum, to empty boxes?
(crashes)
We throw them away.
-  And then Mum picks them up later.
- Yep, that's how it
goes most of the time.
Now, you may have already
noticed I've actually kept
some of the bullets
from the previous video.
I'm gonna be using them as well
because they turned out really good
and I may as well just
get the most out of them.
Wait, what?
I think I ...
Oh no, I think I bought
the wrong size glue.
Oh no, don't tell me I've
bought the wrong size glue.
That would be a disaster.
That would be an outrage.
(clicking)
Doesn't appear to be doing anything.
-  Bob the Builder (singing).
(tapping)
Oh dear.
It's a confused-looking boy.
- I'm not sure what's going on here.
(beeps)
Guys, we've managed to get it working.
We're gonna get started
with the first bullet
and I think for this
one, I'm just gonna use
one of these multi-colored
thumbtack things.
We're just gonna get started.
-  I've never even seen
one of those before, Morgan.
- It's melting it, but it's
glooping out of this side.
This really hasn't gone
well, this, has it so far?
Well, I mean, there we go.
I guess it worked just a
little bit unprofessional,
but yeah, there you go.
That's the first one.
It's literally coming out the wrong side.
I'm just gonna have to shove
it in and just (laughs).
I think we bought the wrong
size glue to be honest.
I think that's what's happened.
-  We?
- Well, me.
For this one, let's do a nail.
Let's just shove a big, fat nail on there.
-  Oh my word.
- There's two bullets, there we go.
(dings)
Time to move onto the second gun.
Now, this one looks pretty
cool because this one is
a blow dart, so you blow on
the end and it shoots the dart.
Obviously, you know I'm
good at blowing things,
so I should be good at this.
- That's what she said.
(laughing)
- I think this one's
packaged a little bit easier,
but I'm still kind of struggling.
I'm taking that back.
This one is not packaged easier.
I'm still struggling.
What are they tryin' to keep out of this?
They protected it like it's a real gun.
(plastic cracking)
Oh my.
Oh my god.
There we go finally.
How does this one even work?
So you blow there.
What do you do?
Do you like put 'em all in like that?
(thumps)
Oh my god.
(laughing)
That is amazing, oh my god.
(hissing)
(gasps)
The glue is actually set
in between the trigger.
Hold on, some's coming out.
A little bit's coming out,
just like a tiny little bit.
Let's add a bloody thumbtack on the end.
Why the hell not?
There we go.
Seems to have stuck alright,
so yeah, I guess there's the first one.
I think that'll stay.
I think we've done another one.
And bang.
There we go.
Three more bullets
added to the collection.
Second gun is now done.
Third gun now.
We're getting on to the big guns here.
Literally, the big guns.
I assume that means more over-packaging
because literally like if
the small ones were hard
to get out of the box, god knows
what the big ones are gonna be like.
Genuinely, why do they
feel the need to package it
as if it's like a military weapon?
(beeps)
-  Wow.
That's mad.
(rattling)
- Wow.
-  Wow.
I feel like I'm with the Terminator.
- Jesus.
(rattling)
It's pretty cool.
(dings)
Okay, we've got a lot
of bullets for this one
which means a lot more hot
glue and a lot more waiting
for it to produce the hot glue apparently.
Oh boy, look at that.
There we go, that's another one done.
Here we go, boys and girls,
we're getting another one through.
Can we get another one done right now?
I think we can.
Look at that.
Guys, I did a few more
of these off-camera,
so look at that.
That's them boys done for that gun.
Look at that: deadly.
Now, guys, it's time to move on
to this absolutely ginormous one.
Literally, this is gonna be huge.
I don't even know where
to begin with this one.
Seriously, look at it.
Oh my god, if I was a kid,
I'd definitely need my
dad's help opening this.
-  Do you want me
to call him, Morgan?
- Yeah, 'cause honestly.
-  'Cause you're a
kid, aren't you really?
- I still am a kid.
(beeps)
What kid plays with this?
My god.
-  Is it heavy?
- Not really.
It's just bloody huge.
-  Oh, I know what that is.
That's what you put the bullets in.
I think you should have a go with that one
without any nails on it
just to see how it goes.
- Yeah we should, shouldn't we.
Okay, guys, we're putting
all the bullets in now.
We're just gonna have a test run with this
before we obviously, you
know, get everything going,
but yeah, that's why I want (rattling).
Jesus crikey.
(crashes)
-  You put it the wrong way 'round.
That's the big one.
- Quick little update, guys.
We're gonna have to go to
the shop because the big gun,
it doesn't take AA batteries.
It doesn't take AAA batteries.
It takes the really fat ones
that you literally use for nothing.
Like, what the hell?
Anyway, yeah, we're gonna
have to go to the shop
and I'll see you guys in about 20 minutes.
Okay, guys, all sorted.
We've got the batteries,
but while Mum was away.
Yes, I stayed home (laughs)
because I'm pretty lazy.
While Mum was away, I actually managed
to work on all of the
bullets and guess what, guys?
It's time to roll the cinematics.
(chiming)
Let's do this.
("Ultimate" by Denzel Curry)
Okay, guys, so we're back.
We've got the batteries in
the gun and it's literally,
we're about ready.
Now, as you saw, I've got
all the bullets ready,
but what I actually did is I left half
of the big, red bullets in the actual gun,
the big gun, without any pins in them.
That's because before we shoot it
with the dangerous bullets,
we want to test the gun out
with just the normal bullets.
So that's what we're gonna do right now.
I'm gonna take like 10 bullets
from that gun right now.
Mum's gonna be the one shootin' 'em.
Guys, one like equals one prayer
because I'm a little bit scared.
I'm not gonna lie.
Okay, Mum, whenever you're ready.
-  Alright.
Nothing's happening.
- Mum!
Oh!
(screaming)
-  Excellent.
(laughing)
- Wait, are none left yet?
Are none left?
-  No, they're all gone.
- Oh my god.
I got like four in the back of the head.
-  I know.
- Okay, guys, for some reason I've agreed
to let my mum shoot me without my top on,
so I'm really not looking forward to this.
I'm not gonna lie.
Ah!
(shouting)
(buzzing)
(screaming)
-  Are you alright, last of 'em?
- Oh my god.
(buzzing)
Oh.
-  Oh, actually it is done.
- Oh god, that did not tickle.
(beeps)
So because Mum just got to shoot me twice,
she's agreed to let me do it once.
You ready, Mum?
-  Yeah.
-  Three,
two,
one.
(thumps)
- Ow.
God, that actually hurt.
No, ow.
Ow, ow, ow.
(laughing)
Ow.
Ah.
Ow.
-  Headshot.
(thumps)
Oh.
- Oh.
Ow.
(laughing)
- That was it, that's it.
(laughing)
Okay, guys, as you can see,
we have created our own
little shooting range.
We've got smaller balloons, bigger ones.
We're gonna try and pop
all of these with the guns.
So we're gonna start with the mini-pistol.
Literally, simple as it gets.
I'm just gonna get one
of these small, actually.
These take the big darts, actually.
(dings)
We're gonna get one of these
big darts with the spike end.
I'm gonna put that in there
and I'm gonna just give it a shot.
Which one should I aim for.
Give me one.
-  A middle one, the middle blue.
-  Middle blue.
Three,
two,
one.
(pops)
Easy as you like.
-  Whoa.
- Easy as you like, guys.
Mum, check this trick shot out.
(thumps)
- Ah.
- Oh.
- What did it hit?
-  Nothing.
-  Three, two, one.
(thumps)
Wow.
Wow.
-  Not very good.
- That was very anticlimactic, wasn't it?
-  Yeah.
- Okay, that wasn't too bad.
I mean, when I was aiming
front-on, I got one,
but when I stared getting
a little bit cocky
couldn't really do it.
Yeah, anyway what we're
gonna do now is move on
to the blowgun.
This is the one that I am
by far the most excited for
just 'cause I've never
seen anything like it.
Can it do four?
It can do four, guys.
We've got some wooden ones.
We got some pin ones.
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna
put my mouth around it.
-  Blow double sort to one dud.
-  No way did I miss all four.
Are you kidding me?
-  That was so cool.
- Mum, I'm mad.
What am I doing?
-  Just open it up.
- Okay, we've got the wooden dart.
I'm gonna aim for the
big green one down there.
Three,
two,
one.
(hissing)
-  Oops.
Oops.
- Not been very good so far, has it, Mum?
-  No.
- I think it's 'cause we
only put one in that time.
I think we've just got to put three in.
Three bullets are in, guys.
Three,
two,
one.
(pops)
Yes!
-  Whoa.
- Finally.
Come on.
-  What a bang in that one there.
- I'm sorry, but this one is that cool.
- It's good, yeah.
- I'm just gonna go again.
Okay, blowgun loaded
with three more darts.
Three, two,
one.
(inhales)
(thumps)
How have I missed again?
That's enough for the blow dart, guys.
We're moving on.
Okay, we're moving on to this one now
which looks like a beast.
Not really sure how you work it though.
I'm not sure if these bullets
are actually gonna go in,
like more than one of them,
so I think what we're gonna have to do is
we're gonna have to put one at the top
and then just keep putting
one in if you get me.
Three,
two,
one.
(clicking)
Oh, there we go.
Bang!
(record screeching)
Wait, what?
(clicks)
What on Earth is happening?
(rattling)
This hasn't really gone
to plan, has it, Mum?
Bloody hell.
Mum, I don't know where it's gone.
I've just looked and it's in there.
(rattling)
It just fell out.
So for this one, guys, I guess
we're just gonna have to do
with the normal bullets,
but I'm actually interested
to see if the normal bullet
will be enough to pop a balloon.
So, you know, I'm still damn excited.
I'm still very frickin' excited for this.
Also, guys, I forgot to
mention do not try this at home
because this is pretty frickin' dangerous.
Okay, we've got it.
We're gonna shove it right in there.
(rattling)
Oh god.
Okay, there we go.
Pull back,
push forward.
Here we go.
Mum, give me one to aim for.
-  That blue one on the
left of the one that's popped.
-  Do you mean
that one right there?
(thumps)
Oh, wow.
It didn't pop it.
Hold on, I've got an idea.
Three, two,
one.
(thumps)
Oh my god.
These balloons are sturdy.
Surely now.
Three,
two,
one.
(clicks)
(clicking)
Wow.
Ah.
(pops)
(laughs)
(banging)
No, what the hell?
(bangs)
What the hell?
(bangs)
Oh my god.
(beeps)
That's enough of that gun, guys.
It didn't go very well, did it?
(dings)
Okay, guys, now it is
time for the big one.
Guys, the problem with this is
it's kind of the same
problem as the last gun.
You can't actually fit these in.
I don't know if you can tell,
but it won't actually go 'round and in.
So guys, unfortunately, the really big gun
literally just stopped working.
We went all out shopping, got
them for literally nothing.
I know it's a bit annoying, but
at least we actually did get
to shoot it earlier in the video.
Guys, I'm not gonna let you down.
I'm gonna take this to the next level
because what I've done,
I've got the old gun
from the last video and I'm
gonna heat up these nails
on the end to make them
hopefully 1000 degrees
and then shoot them at that.
Guys, we are taking this
to a whole new level.
So what we're gonna do, we're gonna go up
to the kitchen right now,
we're gonna turn the hob on,
and we're gonna burn these nails
to make them hopefully
red hot and 1000 degrees.
Then, we're gonna rush
back down, come here,
and shoot some dumb balloons.
So, Mum, let's go.
It is quite annoying that
the red gun didn't work,
but I think this is gonna be even better.
Okay, we're at the hob right now.
I'm literally just gonna
hold the nails over it.
I'm gonna make sure
not to burn the plastic
because that wouldn't be good.
Oh no.
It melted.
Okay, one of them has died.
Actually, that was the one
with the glue on the end.
-  Melted then.
- Okay, the other ones will be fine.
Oh no, fire.
We have fire.
These are literally flaming
darts, like these are flaming.
Mum, do you reckon that's ready?
-  I reckon that's very ready.
-  Do you reckon it's very ready?
-  Very ready.
-  Well, then
quick, let's rush down.
We've got to keep the heat.
We've got to keep the heat.
Okay, you ready, Mum?
(clicks)
-  Yeah.
- Okay, here we go.
Three, two, one.
(thumps)
Oh no, come on.
Three, two, one.
(clicks)
(laughs)
Quick.
Please.
No, what the hell?
If we don't even destroy one of them,
then this is gonna be terrible.
Three,
two,
one.
(clicks)
-  One more go.
Go Morgan.
- Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Three, two, one.
(pops)
-  Yay.
(sighs)
- Finally.
Oh my goodness.
(beeps)
If you've seen the last video we did,
you'll know that the shotgun
was absolutely amazing.
We seem to have loads of bullets left,
so what we're gonna do is we're
just gonna do a full round
of the shotgun to shoot a shotgun test.
This one now.
Three,
two,
one.
(pops)
(clicks)
(pops)
(clicking)
(popping)
Oh, oh, oh,
-  Brilliant.
- I was silent then, I
was focused, and we popped
I think, three balloons.
Let's go get the bullets.
It is time for round two.
Here we go.
I'm gonna try and take
out all the red balloons,
so show them the red balloons.
Three, two,
one.
(pops)
Good start, boys, good start.
Three, two,
one.
(pops)
(clicks)
Brilliant.
-  Whoa.
-  Look at the size of these too.
- They're tiny.
- These ones are tiny.
So three, two,
one.
(clicks)
Oh, come on.
Three,
two,
one.
(clicks)
You know what, the smaller ones
are actually harder to break.
Have you noticed?
-  Yeah.
- Wow.
I want to actually test
out the small one again
because I feel like we didn't
give this one enough time.
What should we go for, Mum?
-  The big purple one over there.
- Big purple one.
Three, two,
one.
(popping)
(screaming)
That was amazing.
Oh my god.
Double.
-  How did you do that?
- Double kill, boys, we got a double kill.
(humming)
-  What did I say at
the beginning of the video?
- Small is better than big.
-  Small is better.
- Small is better.
-  Yeah.
Go for the middle yellow.
- Middle yellow.
Do you know what, Mum?
Eyes closed.
Three, two, one.
(pops)
-  Wow.
- Oh, they're gonna think that's fake.
-  That wasn't
fake, that wasn't fake.
- Oh, they're gonna think that's fake.
Wait, Mum?
-  Yeah?
- What's that behind me?
-  A hole in my wall.
(beeps)
- Look at this one, guys.
This is a double.
This is a double one, okay?
This is going in.
One.
(pops)
Easy stuff, boys and girls, easy stuff.
(popping)
Oh, that feels amazing.
Wait, one more time.
One more time.
(pops)
Oh.
That feels so cool.
-  You're a big child, Morgan.
(dings)
- Okay, Mum, do you know what time it is?
-  Time to go to bed?
- Time for me to get shot.
-  No.
- Yep.
-  You don't really?
- It's gotta happen again.
-  No.
- Guys, you better leave a like.
I'm gonna take a bullet.
-  Not again.
- Guys, leave a like right now.
I'm probably gonna bleed.
I did bleed last time.
Guys, you better leave a
like for this and subscribe.
Wow.
Here we go.
My goodness, I'm not ready for this.
Okay, guys.
I'm gonna count you down, Mum.
Actually, I'll let you count down.
So I'm gonna let her shoot me in my bum.
I'm gonna bend over.
I'm actually really nervous.
The last time it made me bleed
if you didn't see the video.
Oh man, oh.
-  What we're doing?
- Oh, don't, oh.
-  I don't want to do it.
- Ah.
-  Ten, nine.
- Oh, come on.
(thumps)
(screaming)
- Oh, oh.
- You didn't hit my bum.
-  I know, I'm not
very good at aiming.
- Oh, no, no, no.
Ah.
-  Oh god.
Oh my.
You alright?
You asked me to do it,
but I feel awful now.
- Where's the blood?
I can't see it.
-  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
- Is it bad, is it bad, is it bad?
-  No, no, no.
Come back in here.
Just come back in.
-  Should I just?
Oh my god.
-  Come back in here.
It's only a bit.
- I've bled worse than that, but Jesus.
That is quite a lot, that.
I can feel it on my top.
We're gonna have to wash
the top after the video.
Well, thanks for that, Mum.
-  No, it's alright.
I mean, anytime.
(sighs)
I did aim for your bum by the way
'cause I know you've got--
- You hit me in the back.
-  But the bum ...
- That's a terrible place to be hit.
-  I know.
- Well, that was that, guys.

Morgz, she's been Mum.
You guys have been awesome
and I'll see you in my next video.
Peace out.
-  Morgan.
If anybody comes to the
door, just ignore it.
It might be like child
services thinking cruelty.
- Oh yeah, that is true.
You did just make your son bleed.
-  Cruelty.
Yeah, so I'm gonna deny it,
but it's gonna be
difficult if it's on film.
(laughing)
