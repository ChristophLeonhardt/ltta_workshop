let's bring in a member of the Judiciary Committee Democratic senator Chris Coons of Delaware senator thanks for being with us you announced yesterday that you will be a no on the vote for Judge Cavanaugh's confirmation was that because of these allegations from Christine Ford well I take these allegations very seriously and I am glad to hear that on the Judiciary Committee we are going to give them an open hearing but my reasons for voting against Judge Cavanaugh are deeply rooted in my grave concerns about his extreme views on presidential power that's the main thing I focused on in questioning him he's also got ways in which he has spoken and written and decided on issues about individual liberty and our understanding of the Constitution in the modern era that I think are also outside the mainstream so I thought it was important to make it clear that I already have heard enough - in my view justify a no vote and I intend to fully participate in what I expect will be an open and fair process where dr. Ford's disturbing allegations are going to be given full weight senator do you take dr. Ford's allegation at face value I do and I'm encouraged frankly to hear Republican leaders also saying that we need to listen to her and take this seriously because frankly this is about more than one nomination to the Supreme Court more than one of judicial nomination this is about whether we as a country have gotten to the point where we listen to women who raise accusations of sexual assault I do think that we should take President Trump at his word and ensure that everyone is heard and that there is a full process that requires the FBI to do some background investigation here so that it's not simply a he-said she-said testimony that's in front of us next Monday we need a fuller development of the facts yeah senator noah rothman from commentary magazine it seems like a full development of the facts is going to be difficult to assess here I mean the understandably so much time has elapsed and and the victim has not or the alleged victim has not had the opportunity to really fully engage these memories and so the FBI doesn't have a lot to go on we don't have a place we don't have a time we have very limited corroborating evidence witnesses are going to be difficult to find it's going to be hard to assess these facts in really you know very thorough strong fashion so can this victim alleged victim who's on this who's in the front of in front of you testifying can she receive a fair hearing is this process in any way fair to her it's going to expose her to quite a lot of scrutiny that frankly I don't know if she has the ability to stand up to understandably again so is this process in any way going to clarify or is it simply going to make a bad situation worse well that's exactly what I think is going to make Monday a very fraught hearing it would not be that difficult for investigators particularly in the age of social media to find high school classmates of both judge Kavanagh and dr. Ford and to interview what I suspect is a few dozen of them who will have recollections and have insights into the whether or not judge Cavanaugh routinely was someone who drank in high school whether or not he attended social events like this and then frankly whether or not dr. Ford confided in friends or classmates that she'd been the victim of assault to have just the two of them in front of us without judge Cavanaugh's classmate mark judge also in front of us would strike me as reducing this literally to just a he-said she-said session I do respect that senator Feinstein delayed releasing this letter exactly because dr. Ford was so uncomfortable with coming public and that's for exactly the reasons you just referenced in your question this will be a difficult national spectacle for her to go through and I think it's incumbent on all of us and all of us on the Judiciary Committee have to take extra steps to make sure we are both respecting an assumption of Judge Cavanaugh's innocence and listening to and deeply respecting the courage it took for dr. Ford to ultimately come forward with this allegation senator but your your description of what you would hope would take place using social media to perhaps seek out people who knew the woman 36 years ago that just has a rounded description of the potential of this turn into an even larger circus than it might actually become I mean forensically 36 years ago we have two different stories what would you ask as an opening question of Judge Cavanaugh what would you ask well you know the good news is we have several members of the Judiciary Committee who are experienced prosecutors I am NOT an experienced prosecutor both the senator Amy Klobuchar and Senator Kamala Harris are former prosecutors from their respective states as I've been turning over in my head in the last day what sorts of questions I will ask Monday I'll tell you as someone who's never investigated or prosecuted a sexual assault case it is going to be difficult for this to be a constructive and meaningful engagement but the thing I know is that I've got very little in the way in front of me in facts these two individuals dr. Ford and judge Cavanaugh attended small elite private high schools here in the Washington DC suburbs and my hunch is that the lists of who their classmates were a sense of who their social companions were would be very easy to assemble what concerns me is that at least as of last night President Trump has not directed the FBI to engage in any background investigation to assess the credibility of what evidence there is so senator I just a final question I just want some clarification here so Dianne Feinstein was given this letter a few months ago she didn't reveal the letter because dr. Ford requested anonymity is that correct that's my understanding is yeah so so what changed between then and last week when Dianne Feinstein decided to release a letter had she been given permission by dr. Ford to release a letter last week no well my understanding is two things first dr. Ford then hired a lawyer and there was a fair amount of back-and-forth with Deborah Katz her attorney about whether there'd be another letter forthcoming whether she would be willing to testify or not and I respect that senator Feinstein was principally respecting repeated assertions by her attorney that dr. Ford wanted to remain confidential or anonymous I believe it was I believe it was a lead to the media that compelled this I believe it was a to the media of the underlying letter that ultimately forced senator Feinstein's hand and where did that lead come from I have no idea who will who else had the letter other than Diane Feinstein's office I don't know that my hunch is that there were folks on committee staff who had seen the letter and I don't know whether the chairman of the committee had been told about or had seen the letter alright thank you so much senator Coons we appreciate it it's certainly worth a follow-up thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
