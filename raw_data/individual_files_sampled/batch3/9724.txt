Steve: THIS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT. THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS RECEIVED FBI FINAL INVESTIGATION OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH AS SOMEBODY AT THE ADMINISTRATION TALKED TO THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" SAID THERE IS NOTHING, JUDGE, IN THE REPORT THAT CONGRESS IS NOW HOLDING THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY DERAIL HIS NOMINATION. WELL, WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT AND I WOULD OFFER A SLIGHTLY DISSENDING VIEW. I WAS DISAPPOINTED THEY DIDN'T INTERVIEW JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND DR. FORD AND A FEW MORE PEOPLE. NOW, THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT JUDGE KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED, WHETHER THEY DON'T WANT HIM CONFIRMED BECAUSE OF A PER SESSION THAT HE IS IDEOLOGICALLY AGAINST THEM OR BECAUSE THEY REALLY BELIEVE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM NOW HAVE MORE AMMUNITION AND MORE DOUBT TO SAY WHY WAS THE FBI HELD BACK? WAS THE FBI USED AS A POLITICAL INSTRUMENT YET AGAIN? WHY WEREN'T THEY JUST ALLOWED TO INTERVIEW WHOEVER THEY WANTED, INCLUDING THE TWO PRINCIPLES, JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND DR. FORD? THOSE EELINGSZS ARE GOING THOSE AELINGSZS ARE GOING THOSE ALLINGSZS ARE GOING THOSE ALLEGGSZS ARE GOING THOSE ALLEGATZS ARE GOING THOSE ALLEGATIO ARE GOING THOSE ALLEGATIONSRE GOING THOSE ALLEGATIONS A GOING THOSE ALLEGATIONS AREOING THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE GNG THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE GOING TO STICK. AINSLEY: THEY MIGHT HAVE WATCHED THE HEARINGS AND SAID WE WERE GOING TO ASK THOSE EXACT QUESTIONS. THERE IS NO MORE THAT WE NEED. Judge: YOU MAY WELL BE RIGHT. IT'S AWKWARD TO CRITICIZE A REPORT I HAVEN'T SEEN AND PROBABLY WILL NEVER SEE. SOMEBODY IS GOING TO LEAK SOMETHING. BRIAN: BLOOMBERG TOLD THEM THE WHITE HOUSE TOLD THEM NOT TO. IF BLOOMBERG'S REPORT SOMETHING CORRECT AND IF SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S REQUEST FOR THE MEMO FROM DON MCGAHN THE WHITE HOUSE LEGAL COUNSEL TO THE FBI SETTING FORTH THE PARAMETERS OF THE LAST INQUIRY WILL NOT BE MADE PUBLIC THESE ARE LEGITIMATE CRITICISMS. I ALSO WANT TO NOTED HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS BECAUSE I KEEP HEARING THIS FROM FRIENDS IN D.C. FOR THE COURT ITSELF, WHICH NOW IS VIEWED IN THE MINDS OF SO MANY AMERICANS AS JUST ANOTHER POLITICAL INSTITUTION. YOU HAVEN'T HEARD A PEEP FROM ANY OF THE 8, BUT I KNOW SOME OF THEM AND I HAVE HEARD FROM SOME OF THEM. NOT DIRECTLY BUT THROUGH OTHERS, THEY ARE JUST NOT HAPPY AT THE WAY THE COURT ITSELF AS AN INSTITUTION HAS COME OFF. BRIAN: JUDGE, TELL ME IF THIS IS RIGHT. THEY WEREN'T HAPPY IN 2000 WHEN THEY DECIDED BUSH VS. GORE. THEY WILL NOT HEAR WHEN JOHN ROBERTS PRESERVED OBAMACARE. THESE THINGS HAVE A WAY OF DISSIPATING. RIGHT NOW JOHN ROBERTS IS A VERY UNHAPPY CHIEF JUSTICE HE WAS WELCOME HE WAS RELCOME HE WAS REACOME HE WAS READYME HE WAS READY TO WELCOME BRETT KAVANAUGH WHOM HE KNOWS BECAUSE HE WORKS THERE WITH OPEN ARMS. NOT HAPPY WITH THE PERCEPTION OF THE SYSTEM. HARSH LIVE CRITICAL TREATING THE COURT AS A POLITICAL INSTITUTION. DOES THE COURT EXIST TO DO THE PEOPLE'S SPHWHIL ABSOLUTELY NOT. THAT'S WHAT CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT EXISTS FOR. THE COURT EXISTS TO INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION AND PRESERVE HUMAN LIBERTY. AINSLEY: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? NOW THE SENATORS WILL READ THIS REPORT? WILL THERE BE A VOTE ON SATURDAY AND IS THERE ANYTHING THE DEMOCRATS CAN DO TO STOP IT. I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING PROFESSIONALLY THE DEMOCRATS CAN DO TO STOP IT UNLESS THEY HAVE THE VOTES. WE WERE TALKING DURING THE BREAK, AND SOME OF THEM MAY NOT MAKE UP THEIR MINDS UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE. BUT KNOWING MITCH MCCONNELL, I DON'T THINK HE IS GOING TO BRING THIS TO THE FLOOR ON A SATURDAY EVENING OR A SUNDAY MORNING, WHENEVER IT'S GOING TO BE NOW WITHOUT HAVING A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF HOW MANY VOTES HE HAS. STEVE: JUDGE, YOU WERE TALKING A MINUTE AGO ABOUT HOW BLASEY FORD'S ATTORNEYS WERE SAYING THIS IS NOT A LEGITIMATE DECISION BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T TALK TO THE TO TWO PRINCIPLES, THE FBI. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE HEARD THE DEMOCRATS SAY THIS IS A JOB INTERVIEW FOR A LIFETIME TENURED JOB WHY DIDN'T MIX OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ASK THE QUESTIONS FOR THEMSELVES? IF YOU HAD A QUESTION FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK THEM WHEN YOU HAD A CHANCE. I THOUGHT THE PROCEDURE WAS AWFUL. STEVE: IT WAS STILL THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THE QUESTIONS. OF THE FIVE MINUTE SERIES OF QUESTIONS BY THIS PROSECUTOR, WHO SOUNDED LIKE SHE WAS TAKING A DEPOSITION IN A CIVIL CASE. BRIAN: SHE NEVER ADJUSTED. SHE NEVER DID. IT WASN'T UNTIL SENATOR GRAHAM WHO MUST HAVE THOUGHT IN HIS OWN MIND, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. I'M GOING TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS. BRIAN: AN ELM BOW LIVING ROOM. AINSLEY: EVERYONE IS CRITICIZING HER. ONE QUESTION SHE ASKED ABOUT THE POLYGRAPH TEST AND DR. FORD'S EX-BOYFRIEND COMES OUT AND SAYS SHE ANSWERED THAT PROSECUTOR'S QUESTION. SHE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE I HAVE NEVER DISCUSSED A POLYGRAPH UNLESS IT'S BEEN WITH MY ATTORNEYS. HE SAID HUH-UH, THAT'S NOT TRUE. SHE HELP PREP HER BEST FRIEND FOR A POLE GOFF. YOU KNOW, HOW DEEP INTO THE WEEDS ARE YOU GOING TO GO? ARE YOU GOING TO TALK TO EVERYBODY THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH EVER WENT DRINKING WITH WHEN HE WAS 17 YEARS OLD OR EVERYBODY THAT DR. FORD EVER TALKED TO? GIVE THE FBI CREDIT FOR KNOWING WHEN TO STOP WHEN THEY MADE THAT DECISION BASED ON THE ANSWERS THAT THEY GOT. IF THEY MADE THAT DECISION ON THE INSTRUCTIONS THEY GOT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, THEN THIS IS NOT A LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION. BRIAN: 650 LAW PROFESSORS SIGNED THAT LETTER SAYING THE SENATE SHOULD NOT CONFIRM BRETT KAVANAUGH. LIBERAL ATTORNEY ALAN DERSHOWITZ SAID DID I NOT SIGN THAT LETTER. AND I'M OUTRAGED THAT SOMEONE WROTE IT. THEY HAVE ASKED HIM NOT TO COME BACK TO HARVARD LAW SCHOOL TO TEACH THERE. BRIAN: HE CAN'T GO TO BARBECUES ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD AND NOW CAN'T GO BACK. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT DERSHOWITZ I'M TALKING ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH. THEY DON'T WANT JUDGE KAVANAUGH BACK THERE WHICH IS ABSURD. STEVE: BEFORE DID YOU GO, TELL US WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS SCIF, THE SECURITY AREA STARTING AT 8:00 WHEN THE SENATORS GO IN AND READ THIS THING? YOU GO IN THERE AND YOU READ IT AND YOU CAN'T A MOBILE ENTERPRISE WITH YOU AND ANY WRITING MATERIAL. BRIAN: RIGHT AT COMPREHENSION PORTION OF THE SAT. PREVIOUS REPORTS ON HIM WERE DISTRIBUTED TO EVERYBODY IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. THIS IS THE ONLY ONE BEING KEPT IN A SAFE. STEVE: SHOULD IT BE PUBLIC. YES, YES, IT SHOULD. BRIAN: YOU ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH 24 THIS WHOLE PROCESS. 50% OF EVERYTHINGS THAT THAT HAPPENED YOU DISAGREE WITH. THREE PEOPLE CAN KEEP A SECRET IF TWO OF THEM ARE DEAD. SOMEBODY IS GOING TO LOOK AT THIS STUFF AND REVEAL WHAT'S IN THERE AND IN THERE IND IN THERE IFD IN THERE IF IT FURTHERS THEIR VIEW OF HIM. THIS WAS IN THERE. THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT IT. AINSLEY: I REMEMBER THAT RIDDLE. WHAT RIDDLE? AINSLEY: ABOUT KEEPING A SECRET. BEN FRANKLIN LINE. BRIAN: BEN FRANKLIN VERY BRIGHT.
