okay well let's try to get a handle on the situation now on cross life to Anastasio choke now who's been following the speech Forres anastacio can you talk us through the meeting so far please well the niki there we have it Theresa May has made her statement where she's laid out the measures that the UK now plans to take against Russia she said that Russia's response and ignoring Britain's ultimatum and deadlines to come forward and basically admit that they are behind the poisoning of Sergey scrapple which Russia of course has refused to do saying it had nothing to do with that case Theresa May has described that as a disdain given the gravity of the events that have unraveled and she has called the Russian state culpable in those events now she's listed a series of measures that the UK is going to be taking including the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats from London she said they have to leave within one week and she's described this as the biggest expulsion of diplomats in terms of numbers in 30 years there will also be a series of other measures taken including new legislative powers given to the UK heightening its defense strengthening legal powers for sunk sanctions following violations of human rights monitoring and tracking travelers coming to the UK if they're seen as a potential threat targeting Russian money that she's described as being taken to the UK by the corrupt elite freezing some Russian assets in terms of those that they see is questionable as well as there will be no officials coming to the World Cup held in the summer the in in Russia this summer and she has said that all high-level communication is now going to be suspended between the two countries let's take a listen to in more detail to what she said to speaker there is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable for the attempted murder of mr. scribble and his daughter under the Vienna Convention the United Kingdom will now expel 23 Russian diplomats who have been identified as undeclared intelligence officers they have just one week to leave so we will suspend all planned high-level bilateral contacts between the United Kingdom and the Russian Federation this includes revoking the invitation to foreign minister Lavrov to pay a reciprocal visit to the UK and confirming there will be no attendance by ministers or indeed members of the royal family at this summer's World Cup in Russia well the opposition leader the the leader of the Libra party Jeremy Corbyn raised some questions in terms of whether or not the UK government had provided Russia with some facts that it's been asking for whether or not a formal request for evidence and sample and the sample that Russia had asked for had been met whether there was any conversation with the Russian government about all of these events and he said that it's made essential to maintain dialogue with the Russian Federation and to those questions Theresa made didn't quite give an answer let's take a look as the prime minister taken the necessary steps under the Chemical Weapons Convention to make a formal request for evidence from the Russian government under Article 9.2 how has she responded to the Russian government's request for a sample of the agent used in the Solsbury attack to run its own tests as high-resolution trace analysis been run on a sample of the nerve agent and has that revealed any evidence as to the location of its production or the identity of its perpetrators and can the Prime Minister update the house on what conversations if any she has had with the Russian government and while and while suspending planned high-level contacts does the Prime Minister agree that it is essential to maintain a robust dialogue with Russia well Teresa mated all of this had to say that it's not a question of UK diplomacy this is a question of Russia's keep with culpability now to be clear again Russia throughout this whole week of this story snowballing into an international scandal has been saying it has nothing to do with the situation it's been asking for samples of the nerve agent from British officials so Russia could inspect it it's been asking for an official request from Britain to partake in this investigation and to give answers but the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov earlier today said that no such official request has ever been filed to Russia and that it would have been responded within 10 days if one was sent let's take a listen to the Russian Foreign Minister we haven't received any official requests from London based on its own obligations in accordance with the Chemical Weapons Convention we've told Britain we're ready to respond if they file the request instead of filing the official request the UK continues to pull political stunts well know now that Theresa May has laid out the steps that the British government plans to take in connection to Russia and this spy story that has been unraveling we're going to be waiting to see exactly what Russia's reaction is going to be which could of course will come shortly but to take a look back at how exactly this spiraled from a potentially local incident to into a major diplomatic saga let's now go to our report on Sunday March 4th a couple are found slumped on a bench in Salisbury reporters arrived at the scene for what was thought to be a local incident but soon after a global media frenzy unravels with accusations allegations and speculation moving at the speed of light exposure to an unknown substance enter comparisons to the 2006 death of Alexander Litvinenko March 6th the uk's counterterrorism police take control of the investigation the UK's foreign secretary Boris Johnson has this to say while it would be wrong to prejudge the investigation I can reassure the house that should evidence emerge that implies state responsibility then Her Majesty's Government will respond appropriately and robustly Russia says it has no information and offers to help in any way it can these headlines leave little to the imagination long before any conclusions are drawn Russia is being vilified the dots have been connected in the eyes of the world press details of the kind of punishment Russia could face range from diplomatic expulsion to measures connected to the World Cup to be held in Russia this summer on March 12th amidst a media hype and under pressure to take a tough stance from her government British prime minister Theresa May is expected to provide clarity the government has concluded that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible for the act against Sergey and Giulio scribble an ultimatum is given to Russia come clean or else while Russia asks for proof evidence and facts we're of course getting many questions regarding how and where the nerve agent is actually administered I can't comment on that at this time we are not declaring a person of interest or a suspect at this time in a court of law this would at least mean a time out in the world of political gameplay apparently it means very little anastasiya Churkin are RT London okay we're going to be bringing you more analysis and insight in this breaking news story in the coming minutes and hours that were also expecting a statement to be released by the Russian Foreign Ministry very soon so do stay tuned for that Russia's ambassador to the UK has said he believes the British government is acting inappropriately and need to meet its obligations under international law here is what is done to do this the provocation we believe that the United Kingdom should follow the international law and under under this obligations they have chemical weapons they have to present the request to the organization and then we're happy to consider this within the 10 days this is the international law and of course we are not ready to to talk in the way of the ultimatums
