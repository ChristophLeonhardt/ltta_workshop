1
00:00:00,095 --> 00:00:01,296
ON THE 12TH, DOES NOT MEAN THAT

2
00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:03,198
IT GETS ALL DONE AT ONE MEETING.

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:04,633
MAYBE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SECOND

4
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:05,434
OR THIRD.

5
00:00:05,434 --> 00:00:08,203
MAYBE WE WILL HAVE NONE!

6
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:09,071
>> Bret: MULTIPLE SUMMITS?

7
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:11,373
WE HAVE SEEN THAT BEFORE.

8
00:00:11,373 --> 00:00:12,674
BY THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT

9
00:00:12,674 --> 00:00:14,409
THIS POSSIBLE SUMMIT ON

10
00:00:14,409 --> 00:00:16,812
JUNE 12TH, IF IT STAYS, TALKING

11
00:00:16,812 --> 00:00:18,447
TO REUTERS ON AIR FORCE ONE, I

12
00:00:18,447 --> 00:00:19,781
WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT DONE IN ONE

13
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:20,916
MEETING, BUT OFTENTIMES THAT IS

14
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,017
NOT THE WAY THAT THE DEAL WORKS.

15
00:00:22,017 --> 00:00:23,585
THERE IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT

16
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:25,153
IT WILL NOT BE DONE IN ONE

17
00:00:25,153 --> 00:00:26,688
MEETING OR TWO MEETINGS OR THREE

18
00:00:26,688 --> 00:00:27,723
MEETINGS, BUT IT WILL GET DONE

19
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:28,423
AT SOME POINT.

20
00:00:28,423 --> 00:00:29,925
I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE

21
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:30,258
LETTER.

22
00:00:30,258 --> 00:00:32,259
I LOOK FORWARD TO JUNE 12, WHERE

23
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,429
HOPEFULLY WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS.

24
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:37,199
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A TOTAL

25
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:39,368
DENUCLEARIZATION AND AS QUICK AS

26
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:39,768
PRACTICABLE.

27
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:40,969
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT MACHINERY.

28
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:42,170
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THINGS

29
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,805
THAT CANNOT HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY,

30
00:00:43,805 --> 00:00:45,073
BUT THEY CAN HAPPEN IN AS RAPID

31
00:00:45,073 --> 00:00:47,209
A FASHION AS THEY CAN HAPPEN.

32
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:49,745
THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO HAPPEN.

33
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:51,780
LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL, START

34
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,347
THERE.

35
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:54,549
JONATHAN SWANN, NATIONAL

36
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:55,417
POLITICAL REPORTER FOR AXIOS,

37
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:56,351
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY.

38
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:57,586
A SENIOR EDITOR AT THE

39
00:00:57,586 --> 00:00:59,287
FEDERALIST COMING IN CHARLES

40
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:00,655
LANE, OPINION WRITER FOR

41
00:01:00,655 --> 00:01:01,223
"THE WASHINGTON POST."

42
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:02,324
I SENSE THAT THERE IS KIND OF A

43
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:03,658
SETTING OF EXPECTATIONS HERE OF

44
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:06,428
WHAT COULD BE A FIRST IN A

45
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:07,329
SERIES THAT THEY DO NOT THINK

46
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:08,497
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET IT

47
00:01:08,497 --> 00:01:09,398
ALL IN ONE.

48
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:11,299
>> I TALKED TO A SENIOR

49
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,402
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL YESTERDAY

50
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:15,203
THEY SAY THAT TODAY ARE STILL

51
00:01:15,203 --> 00:01:16,138
HOPING THAT IT IS JUNE 12, BUT

52
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:20,375
THERE IS STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY,

53
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,576
THERE WERE NOT DETAILS WITH

54
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:23,278
NORTH KOREA, IT COULD BE PUSHED

55
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:24,579
OUT BY A FEW DAYS.

56
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:27,749
AND OF COURSE, WHO KNOWS, IF KIM

57
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:28,784
JONG UN, SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN

58
00:01:28,784 --> 00:01:30,585
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN THAT BLOWS

59
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:31,153
NO BOLTING UP.

60
00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:32,754
>> Bret: IT IS SIGNIFICANT AT

61
00:01:32,754 --> 00:01:34,022
THIS TOP GUY IS COMING.

62
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:35,390
TO THE OVAL OFFICE.

63
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,792
>> VERY SIGNIFICANT.

64
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:37,559
AND WORKING UNDER THE ASSUMPTION

65
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:39,061
THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN,

66
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:40,362
THE PRESIDENT WANTS IT TO

67
00:01:40,362 --> 00:01:40,695
HAPPEN.

68
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:42,898
AND EVEN THE SKEPTICS ON HIS

69
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:44,766
TEAM LIKE JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL

70
00:01:44,766 --> 00:01:45,834
SECURITY ADVISOR KNOWS THAT THE

71
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:47,035
PRESIDENCY IS A PATH HERE.

72
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:49,237
AND THEY ARE NOT FIGHTING THE

73
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:49,604
DECISION.

74
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:51,206
>> Bret: IT DOES NOT MATTER

75
00:01:51,206 --> 00:01:52,941
THE DATE OF JUNE 12, IT MATTERS

76
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:54,242
WHAT THEY GET OUT OF IT.

77
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:55,110
AND IF THEY GET OUT OF IT.

78
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,678
>> THERE IS A PATTERN IN HISTORY

79
00:01:56,678 --> 00:01:58,080
WHERE YOU HAVE A REALLY LONG

80
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,514
LEAD UP TO A MEETING.

81
00:01:59,514 --> 00:02:01,183
WORK OUT AND YOU NEGOTIATE WHAT

82
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:01,850
WILL BE DISCUSSED.

83
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,617
THEN YOU HOPE FOR THE BEST I

84
00:02:02,617 --> 00:02:06,521
WILL HAVE AN EDIT WEEDING.

85
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:08,556
ONE GETS THE SENSE BECAUSE WE

86
00:02:08,556 --> 00:02:10,025
HAVE HAD SUCH BAD COMMUNICATION,

87
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:11,460
MAY BE JUST MEETING AND GETTING

88
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,461
THINGS STARTED RIGHT AWAY WILL

89
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:15,764
BE HELPFUL EVEN THOUGH I DO NOT

90
00:02:15,764 --> 00:02:17,332
THINK THAT TERRIBLY MUCH WILL BE

91
00:02:17,332 --> 00:02:18,967
ACCOMPLISHED SO EARLY THAT IT

92
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:19,868
WILL TAKE FURTHER MEETINGS AND

93
00:02:19,868 --> 00:02:21,403
MORE HASHING OUT.

94
00:02:21,403 --> 00:02:23,772
AND IF WE DID HERE BEFORE

95
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:24,439
PRESIDENT TRUMP CANCELED A

96
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,474
MEETING THAT NORTH KOREA HAVE

97
00:02:25,474 --> 00:02:26,174
PROPOSED SIMILAR THINGS ALONG

98
00:02:26,174 --> 00:02:27,476
THE LINE TO WHAT THEY HAVE

99
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:28,210
PROPOSED IN THE PAST.

100
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,578
WHEN THEY GET A BIG BUNDLE OF

101
00:02:29,578 --> 00:02:31,580
MONEY FOR PROMISING TO DO

102
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:31,947
SOMETHING.

103
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:33,982
I DO NOT THINK THAT THAT WILL

104
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:34,749
SATISFY THE U.S. NEGOTIATORS

105
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:36,084
THIS TIME AROUND.

106
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:37,586
>> Bret: IN THE MEANTIME, THE

107
00:02:37,586 --> 00:02:40,255
RUSSIANS ARE MAKING A MOVE TO

108
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:42,757
NORTH KOREA.

109
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:44,593
>> HE SENDS HIS WARMEST REGARDS

110
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:45,460
AND BEST WISHES AND THE

111
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,796
ENDEAVORS THAT HAVE BEEN

112
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:48,563
INITIATED ON THE KOREAN

113
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:49,664
PENINSULA WITH YOUR

114
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:50,098
PARTICIPATION.

115
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:52,234
THE SITUATION ON THE CAN KOREAN

116
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:56,505
PENINSULA IS CHANGING ACCORDING

117
00:02:56,638 --> 00:02:58,640
THAT PUTIN'S GOVERNMENT IS

118
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,475
ACTING IN OPPOSITION OF THE

119
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:01,376
UNITED STATES.

120
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:02,177
WE ARE READY TO NEGOTIATE WITH

121
00:03:02,177 --> 00:03:03,245
THE RUSSIAN SIDE.

122
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:06,581
>> PIECE, PER VILLAGE HE, AND

123
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:07,549
PROSPERITY IN SOUTHEAST IN

124
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:09,885
GENERAL ARE IN OUR INTEREST.

125
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:12,053
>> Bret: WARM AND FUZZY WITH

126
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:13,155
KIM JONG UN, CLEARLY SENDING A

127
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:13,922
MESSAGE THAT WE ARE STILL

128
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:14,256
AROUND.

129
00:03:14,256 --> 00:03:16,024
>> WE ARE STILL AROUND, WE ARE

130
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:16,758
STILL ON YOUR BORDER.

131
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:17,592
WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING

132
00:03:17,592 --> 00:03:19,394
ON.

133
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:22,097
YES, IT IS A BIG EVENT, WHATEVER

134
00:03:22,097 --> 00:03:23,331
IT WAS ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA.

135
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:25,600
AND IT SEEMS LIKE HE IS GETTING

136
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,568
SERIOUS BETWEEN YOU AND

137
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:27,202
DONALD TRUMP.

138
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:28,570
WHAT IS VERY INTERESTING ABOUT

139
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,139
THAT LITTLE MEETING IS THAT IT

140
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:32,974
SHOWS KIM JONG UN HAS SOMEHOW

141
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:34,176
MANAGED TO PUT HIMSELF, IT'S ON

142
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:36,178
THE PSYCHE IS COURTING, HE IS

143
00:03:36,178 --> 00:03:38,346
SORT OF THE MOST ELIGIBLE

144
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:39,848
BACHELOR IN NORTHEAST ASIA, AND

145
00:03:39,848 --> 00:03:41,016
EVERYBODY IS COMING TO HIM TO

146
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:41,983
SEE WHAT HE WANTS.

147
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:45,153
AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE YOU

148
00:03:45,153 --> 00:03:45,587
HAPPY.

149
00:03:45,587 --> 00:03:46,288
TRYING TO GET INFLUENCE WITH

150
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:46,555
HIM.

151
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:47,589
I THINK THAT THAT IS A VERY

152
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:49,558
STRONG POSITION FOR HIM TO BE

153
00:03:49,558 --> 00:03:49,824
IN.

154
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:51,126
THE UNITED STATES HAS QUITE

155
00:03:51,126 --> 00:03:53,161
OPENLY SAID, IF YOU DO BUSINESS

156
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:56,998
WITH US, IF YOU GIVE US WHAT WE

157
00:03:56,998 --> 00:03:58,066
WANT, WE ARE PREPARED TO

158
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:59,334
GUARANTEE YOUR SAFETY, MAKE YOU

159
00:03:59,334 --> 00:03:59,968
RICH.

160
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:00,669
THE PRESIDENT EVEN SAID, MAKE

161
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:03,171
YOU HAPPY.

162
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:07,375
AND THAT IS A VERY SWEET OFFER

163
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,176
THAT PROBABLY ALARMS THE

164
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:09,377
RUSSIANS AND THE CHINESE A

165
00:04:09,377 --> 00:04:10,979
LITTLE BIT THAT MAY BE THE

166
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:12,447
UNITED STATES, MY GOSH, WILL

167
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:14,349
TURN OUT TO BE THE MOST

168
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:15,884
INFLUENTIAL POWER RIGHT HERE IN

169
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:16,351
NORTHEAST ASIA.

170
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:18,687
AND THEY ARE MOVING TO CHECK IT

171
00:04:18,687 --> 00:04:18,954
OUT.

172
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:20,622
>> Bret: IN THE MEANTIME, WE

173
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:23,058
ARE STILL CHECKING THE RUSSIA

174
00:04:23,058 --> 00:04:24,259
PROBE ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT

175
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:24,593
FRONTS.

176
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:27,229
THE PRESIDENT TWEETING TODAY A

177
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:28,330
NUMBER OF TWEETS, BUT THIS ONE,

178
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,166
NOT THAT IT MATTERS WHAT I NEVER

179
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,401
FIRED JAMES COMEY BECAUSE OF

180
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:33,768
RUSSIA.

181
00:04:33,768 --> 00:04:34,436
THE CORRUPT MAINSTREAM MEDIA

182
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:36,171
LOVES TO KEEP PUSHING THAT

183
00:04:36,171 --> 00:04:37,472
NARRATIVE, BUT THEY KNOW THAT IT

184
00:04:37,472 --> 00:04:39,374
IS NOT TRUE.

185
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:41,776
THAT PROMPTED A LOT OF LOOKING

186
00:04:41,776 --> 00:04:43,011
INTO SOUND BITES.

187
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:45,981
LIKE THIS ONE FROM NBC.

188
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:46,881
>> REGARDLESS OF RECOMMENDATION,

189
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:50,585
I WAS GOING TO FIRE COMEY,

190
00:04:50,585 --> 00:04:52,220
KNOWING THAT THERE WAS NO GOOD

191
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,388
TIME TO DO IT.

192
00:04:53,388 --> 00:04:54,489
IN FACT, WHEN I DECIDED TO JUST

193
00:04:54,489 --> 00:04:57,158
DO IT, I SAID TO MYSELF, I SAID,

194
00:04:57,158 --> 00:05:00,395
YOU KNOW, THIS RUSSIAN THING

195
00:05:00,395 --> 00:05:01,663
WITH TRUMP AND RUSSIA IS A MADE

196
00:05:01,663 --> 00:05:04,666
UP STORY, IT IS A EXCUSE BY THE

197
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,667
DEMOCRATS FOR HER LOST

198
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:06,735
INCORPORATED LOSING AN ELECTION

199
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:08,303
THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE WON.

200
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:10,972
>> Bret: WHAT IS THE DEAL?

201
00:05:10,972 --> 00:05:12,641
DID YOU FIGURE OUT THE

202
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:13,208
WHITE HOUSE RESPONSE?

203
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,310
>> THEY ARE NOT TALKING MUCH ON

204
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:15,777
THIS.

205
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:17,479
I ACTUALLY DID SOME REPORTING

206
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:19,347
TODAY ON OTHER CONVERSATIONS

207
00:05:19,347 --> 00:05:21,082
THAT TRUMP HAS BEEN HAVING

208
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:21,850
PRIVATELY, PRESSURING JEFF

209
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,385
SESSIONS FOR THE BETTER PART OF

210
00:05:23,385 --> 00:05:23,985
A YEAR OVER THIS.

211
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:25,020
THEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT.

212
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,222
I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE IS A

213
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:28,623
PARTICULARLY GOOD ANSWER FOR

214
00:05:28,623 --> 00:05:29,057
THAT COMMENT.

215
00:05:29,057 --> 00:05:30,792
>> THERE IS A GREAT ANSWER, IF

216
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:32,294
YOU DO THE CLIP JUST A LITTLE

217
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:33,795
BIT LONGER HE TALKS ABOUT MORE

218
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:35,997
THAT HE KNOWS THAT FIRING COMEY

219
00:05:35,997 --> 00:05:36,598
MIGHT EXTEND THE RUSSIA

220
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:37,165
INVESTIGATION.

221
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:38,800
BUT IT STILL MUST BE DONE.

222
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,168
THAT CLIP IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT

223
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:41,036
TO UNDERSTAND PIT HE IS SAYING

224
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:42,637
THAT HE DID NOT LIKE HOW JAMES

225
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:43,838
COMEY WAS PRIVATELY ASSURING HIM

226
00:05:43,838 --> 00:05:46,107
THAT HE WAS NOW THE TARGET OF A

227
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:46,941
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION WHILE

228
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:48,043
PUBLICLY SUGGESTING TO THE WORLD

229
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:48,710
THAT HE

230
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,411
WAS.

231
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:51,046
EVEN THOUGH JAMES COMEY WAS

232
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:52,714
DOING THESE J. EDGAR HOOVER TYPE

233
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:54,649
OF GAMES IT MIGHT CAUSE HIM

234
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:55,617
TROUBLE ON THE RUSSIA

235
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:56,785
INVESTIGATION, HE NEEDED TO FIRE

236
00:05:56,785 --> 00:05:57,552
HIM BECAUSE HE WAS SO BAD AT HIS

237
00:05:57,552 --> 00:05:58,887
JOB AND BECAUSE HE WAS BAD FOR

238
00:05:58,887 --> 00:06:00,221
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

239
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:01,289
I THINK PARTICULARLY WITH WHAT

240
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:02,257
WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT JAMES

241
00:06:02,257 --> 00:06:03,291
COMEY IN THE YEAR SINCE THAT

242
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,326
INTERVIEW WAS GIVEN, WHICH I

243
00:06:04,326 --> 00:06:05,927
THINK WAS JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO

244
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:07,462
NOW, WE REALLY SHOULD HAVE A

245
00:06:07,462 --> 00:06:09,731
CLEAR UNDERSTAND OF WHAT HE WAS

246
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:10,065
SAYING.

247
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:11,800
>> Bret: SURE, BUT THEY DO NOT

248
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,702
HAVE YOU TALKING FOR THEM AND

249
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:14,536
THEY DO NOT HAVE YOU EXPLAINING

250
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:15,203
IT TO.

251
00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:16,538
WHEN THE TWEETS COMES OUT, IT IS

252
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:17,238
NOT THAT CLEAR.

253
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:18,973
SO A LOT OF TIMES YOU HAVE TO

254
00:06:18,973 --> 00:06:19,441
READ BETWEEN --

255
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:20,975
>> I WILL NOT DISAGREE WITH YOU

256
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:22,777
THAT THEY COULD DO A BETTER JOB

257
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:24,646
MESSAGING WHAT IS BEING SAID.

258
00:06:24,646 --> 00:06:30,785
AND PUTTING OUT WHAT THAT WHOLE

259
00:06:30,785 --> 00:06:31,319
INTERVIEW WAS SHOWN.

260
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:31,986
>> IT IN THE MEANTIME RUDY

261
00:06:31,986 --> 00:06:34,356
GIULIANI IS GOING AFTER TREY

262
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:37,125
GOWDY ON WHAT HE SAID OF THE

263
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,693
INFORMANT OR SPY, TAKE A LISTEN.

264
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:40,929
>> I WENT TO SEE THE DOCUMENTS

265
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:41,996
THAT TREY GOWDY HAS NEVER SEEN,

266
00:06:41,996 --> 00:06:43,932
WHICH IS OUTRAGEOUS.

267
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:47,335
AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET MY

268
00:06:47,335 --> 00:06:48,403
CLIENT TESTIFY, THE PRESIDENT OF

269
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:50,572
THE UNITED STATES, EVEN IF HE

270
00:06:50,572 --> 00:06:52,307
WANTS TO WITHOUT THOSE DOCUMENTS

271
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:52,941
BEING PRODUCED.

272
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:54,976
IF AND WHEN WE FIND THAT THIS

273
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:58,480
WAS HANDLED APPROPRIATELY, AND

274
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,848
THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT THEY

275
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:01,983
CAN BASE THIS ON THE

276
00:07:01,983 --> 00:07:03,385
INVESTIGATION, WE WILL HAVE HIM

277
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:04,152
TESTIFY.

278
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:05,487
>> Bret: CHUCKLED.

279
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:07,589
>> WELL TREY GOWDY DID DELIVER

280
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:09,457
AT LEAST IN P.R. TERMS A VERY

281
00:07:09,457 --> 00:07:10,592
HEAVY BLOW TO THE TRUMP POSITION

282
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:15,864
IN THIS BY COMING FORWARD AND

283
00:07:15,864 --> 00:07:17,365
BLESSING THE MUELLER

284
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:19,401
INVESTIGATION, SORRY, THE FBI

285
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:21,169
INVESTIGATION PRIOR TO MUELLER,

286
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:24,172
DURING THE ELECTION.

287
00:07:24,172 --> 00:07:25,273
SO OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE PUSHING

288
00:07:25,273 --> 00:07:26,374
BACK VERY HARD.

289
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:28,943
I THINK THAT IF I MAY STEP BACK,

290
00:07:28,943 --> 00:07:30,311
WITH WHAT RUDY GIULIANI IS DOING

291
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:34,549
IS A PIECE THAT WOULD PUT THE

292
00:07:34,549 --> 00:07:36,184
TRUMP TWEET TODAY, PREPARING THE

293
00:07:36,184 --> 00:07:38,520
GROUND ON ALL KINDS OF AREAS FOR

294
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,158
WHAT MIGHT BE THE EVENTUAL

295
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:43,825
CONFRONTATION WITH MUELLER.

296
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:45,794
LAYING DOWN MARKERS OF HERE IS

297
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:46,761
OUR VERSION OF EVENTS.

298
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:47,729
HERE IS OUR VERSION OF THE

299
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:49,164
FACTS.

300
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:50,899
TREY GOWDY GOING TO FOLLOW THAT,

301
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:51,933
SO THEY PUSH BACK.

302
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:54,569
>> I WROTE AT "THE FEDERALIST"

303
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:56,871
THAT TREY GOWDY DID NOT SEE ALL

304
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:58,773
OF THE SUBPOENAED DOCUMENTS THAT

305
00:07:58,773 --> 00:08:00,375
THEY ARE SEEKING TO USE THE

306
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,142
INFORMANT THAT HE ALSO SEEMS

307
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:02,243
CONFUSED WHETHER IT WAS A

308
00:08:02,243 --> 00:08:04,579
CRIMINAL PROBE, WE DO NOT USE

309
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:05,880
THE TERM SPY AND CRIMINAL

310
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,449
PROBES, BUT WE SHOULD ALL KNOW

311
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:08,383
BECAUSE JAMES COMEY TESTIFIED

312
00:08:08,383 --> 00:08:10,618
ABOUT THIS IN MARCH 2017, THIS

313
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:12,353
WAS NOT A CRIMINAL PROBE, THIS

314
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:14,389
WAS A COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROBE.

315
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:16,191
SPIES ARE COMMON IN A

316
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:17,625
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROBE, WE DO

317
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,626
WITH POLITICAL OPPONENTS DURING

318
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:20,628
A CAMPAIGN, I THINK IT IS REALLY

319
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:21,996
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE

320
00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:22,997
DISCUSSING.

321
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:24,065
AND THINKING THROUGH AND KNOWING

322
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:25,400
SO MUCH MORE ABOUT WHETHER THEY

323
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,402
ARE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS,

324
00:08:27,402 --> 00:08:28,970
INTERNAL WATCHDOGS, OR PEOPLE IN

325
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,138
THE MEDIA.

326
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:31,239
>> Bret: WHEN TREY GOWDY HAS

327
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:31,940
THESE MEETINGS AND AGREE THAT

328
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,042
THEY DID NOT BRING IN ANY

329
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:36,910
DOCUMENTS, AND THEY HAVE A

330
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,145
CLASSIFIED DEBRIEFING AND THEY

331
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:39,347
EXPLAIN WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

332
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:41,515
AND HE SAYS, YOU SHOULD BE PROUD

333
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:44,152
OF WHAT THE FBI WAS DOING AT THE

334
00:08:44,152 --> 00:08:46,387
TIME, AND YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT.

335
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:48,957
HOW IS THAT INTERPRETED ANY

336
00:08:48,957 --> 00:08:49,324
OTHER WAY?

337
00:08:49,324 --> 00:08:51,159
>> WELL I AM NOT ENTIRELY SURE

338
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:51,926
HOW TO EXPLAIN WHAT TREY GOWDY

339
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:52,360
WAS SAYING.

340
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,862
ALTHOUGH HE DOES HAVE A HISTORY

341
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:55,363
OF BEING A FAN OF THE FBI.

342
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:56,764
BUT HE ALSO COMPLETED WHAT HE

343
00:08:56,764 --> 00:08:58,600
WAS SAYING IN THESE INTERVIEWS

344
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,568
ABOUT WHAT'S PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

345
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:00,835
HAD.

346
00:09:00,835 --> 00:09:01,936
WHEN JAMES COMEY FIRST PRESENTED

347
00:09:01,936 --> 00:09:03,972
TO HIM INFORMATION ABOUT THE

348
00:09:03,972 --> 00:09:05,006
RUSSIANS, WHICH WAS AFTER THE

349
00:09:05,006 --> 00:09:06,207
ELECTION PERIOD HE SAID THAT HE

350
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:07,408
WOULD LIKE A FULLY INVESTIGATED.

351
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:08,977
AND TREY GOWDY SAID, THIS MEANS

352
00:09:08,977 --> 00:09:10,645
THAT IT WAS OKAY TO RUN AN

353
00:09:10,645 --> 00:09:11,479
INFORMANT AGAINST YOUR CAMPAIGN.

354
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:12,780
AND I DO NOT THINK THAT HE

355
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,916
FURTHER SAID THAT THE AMERICAN

356
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:15,717
PEOPLE SUPPORT THE USE OF

357
00:09:15,717 --> 00:09:16,117
INFORMANTS.

358
00:09:16,117 --> 00:09:17,819
HE DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD GRASP ON

359
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:19,120
WHAT AMERICAN PEOPLE THINK ABOUT

360
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,855
RUNNING INFORMANTS ON POLITICAL

361
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:21,222
CAMPAIGNS.

362
00:09:21,222 --> 00:09:22,690
>> Bret: I WANT TO GET TO THE

363
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,259
REST OF THE PANEL, WE ONLY HAVE

364
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,661
A QUICK AMOUNT OF TIME, BUT

365
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:29,397
JONATHAN, ALSO TODAY, THE PARDON

366
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:31,900
OF DINESH DESOUSA, THE PRESIDENT

367
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,134
SAYS THAT HE IS CONSIDERING A

368
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:38,606
PARDON OF MARTHA STEWART SAYING

369
00:09:38,606 --> 00:09:42,577
THAT THE PRESIDENT USE OF

370
00:09:42,577 --> 00:09:43,344
PARDON POWERS IS CONCERNING

371
00:09:43,344 --> 00:09:44,746
ENOUGH BREAD FOR THE POSSIBILITY

372
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:46,514
THAT HE MAY BE SENDING A MESSAGE

373
00:09:46,514 --> 00:09:48,383
TO WITNESSES IN A CRIMINAL

374
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:50,385
INVESTIGATION INTO HIS CAMPAIGN

375
00:09:50,385 --> 00:09:51,819
IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IN THE

376
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:52,587
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, NOBODY

377
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:53,388

IS A PART IN A PARDON OR A PART

379
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:56,691
IN A MESSAGE?

380
00:09:56,691 --> 00:09:58,359
>> I AM A REPORTER, SO I NEED

381
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:58,793
FACTS.

382
00:09:58,793 --> 00:10:00,361

00:10:03,197 --> 00:10:06,134
I DO NOT HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT

00:10:06,134 --> 00:00:00,000
