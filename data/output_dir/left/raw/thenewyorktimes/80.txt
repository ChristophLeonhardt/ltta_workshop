1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
“I thought about what
are the problems that

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,610
are most likely to affect
the future of the world

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,130
or future of humanity.”

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,370
Elon Musk, a South African-born
engineer, inventor

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,370
and billionaire, is one of the
most important entrepreneurs

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,640
in the world.

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,370
But the 47-year-old
is no stranger

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,950
to turmoil, and by
his own account

9
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,780
his career has been
full of highs and lows.

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,400
“Just three years ago,

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,870
I was showering at the Y and
sleeping on the office floor.

12
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,780
And now, I have got
a million-dollar car

13
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,110
and quite a few
creature comforts.”

14
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,690
After making a fortune with
his first successful startup,

15
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,110
Zip2, Musk gained fame
as the co-founder of PayPal

16
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,790
in the late 1990s.

17
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,152
“So this is an ATM.

18
00:00:40,152 --> 00:00:41,610
What we’re going
to do is transform

19
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,500
the traditional
banking industry.”

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,740
The company lost hundreds of
millions of dollars, and Musk

21
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,040
was ousted as CEO because
of internal turmoil.

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,620
But when PayPal
went public in 2002,

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,580
and then was sold to eBay, Musk —
as the biggest shareholder —

24
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,330
walked away
with $200 million.

25
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,360
By the mid-2000s, Musk
had turned around

26
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,850
and invested almost all
of his PayPal fortune

27
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,489
into his new companies:

28
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,080
SpaceX, Tesla and SolarCity.

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,840
With SpaceX, Musk’s aspiration
is out of this world —

30
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,170
literally.

31
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,130
It’s a commercial
space flight company,

32
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,240
which designs and launches
advanced rockets into space.

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,940
“Behind me is where 
Falcon 9 would

34
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,300
sit during launch.”

35
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,419
One of its ambitions is to
eventually send people to Mars.

36
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:36,210
“And I can’t think of
anything more exciting

37
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,178
than going out there and
being among the stars.”

38
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:39,900
But it has faced some roadblocks.

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,410
Their first three
rocket launches —

40
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,380
failed, burning through almost
all of the company’s assets.

41
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,980
But SpaceX has had
recent successes.

42
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,260
The Falcon Heavy launch
earlier this year

43
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,510
was a big milestone
and it carried

44
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,460
an interesting payload:

45
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,880
a dummy astronaut
riding a Tesla car

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,720
that was orbiting space.

47
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,630
The company has also
landed contracts with NASA,

48
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,070
but questions about
safety and cost remain.

49
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,670
“We sold over 1,000
cars — and by sold

50
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,570
I mean people put down a
substantial deposit on the car.”

51
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,880
Tesla, Musk’s
electric car company,

52
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,320
is one of the
first of its kind

53
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,510
to work on a large scale.

54
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,780
It has also successfully
disrupted the auto industry.

55
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,410
The company is valued
at over $50 billion.

56
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,260
The Tesla Model S
has been called

57
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,400
the greatest car ever built.

58
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,360
But Tesla has also faced
some setbacks, including

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,530
car batteries that caught on fire,
recalls and production delays.

60
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,610
SolarCity, Musk’s renewable
energy venture,

61
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,610
initially had a bright future.

62
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,100
It’s the largest provider
of rooftop solar systems

63
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,930
in the U.S., and the company
boomed on Wall Street.

64
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,960
But after investors raised doubts
about its business model,

65
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,240
SolarCity’s shares
quickly lost value,

66
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,930
and Tesla had to take over

67
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,070
in what was widely
seen as a bailout.

68
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,110
“We really need to make
solar panels as appealing

69
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,230
as electric cars have become.”

70
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:16,440
But while Musk may have been
flirting with bankruptcy

71
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,920
and calamity for years,
his projects continue

72
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,930
to captivate the
collective imagination.

73
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,387
“Life has to be more than
about solving problems.

74
00:03:26,387 --> 00:03:28,070
There have to be things
that make you proud

75
00:03:28,070 --> 00:00:00,000
to be a member
of humanity.”
