one secret would be the fact that his name wasn't Jack you know jack was a nickname his real name was Jasper Newton Daniel there's no birth certificate for Jack but he said he was born in September of 1850 but you know even as an adult man he was only 5 foot 2 he wore a size 4 boot he did not immediately start making whiskey for the public he learned how to make whiskey from a Lutheran minister he made medicinal whiskey that was sold in the general store in Lynchburg for several years and he was doing that for his room and board because he found himself orphan at a young age so you know you know from very very humble beginnings Jasper Newton Daniel five foot two in size four boot ironically has become one of the best-known whiskey labels around the world and but if you if you think about the way his life started the odds that we would have you know still be here after 150 years that people his name would be a household name was a probably not something you would have predicted back then
