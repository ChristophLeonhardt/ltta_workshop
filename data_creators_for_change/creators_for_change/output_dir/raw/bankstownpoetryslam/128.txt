<font color="#E5E5E5">if you soon alright so i'll give you be</font>

16
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:57,840
the context because this might be a

<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit confusing i was in a plane on</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">my way to melbourne with my wife and you</font>

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,790
when you're sitting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tarmac with</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">their and it's got fox news and then</font>

22
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,720

what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and i had a kind of</font>

26
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,479
fantasy that this other thing went on

27
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,210
the screen while my life was reading a

28
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,950
book or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if</font>

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,970
screen as in engines of the jet from war

31
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,850
through barrel and blood yet on the

32
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,360
screen soundless news flash past and on

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,000
a different Channel what might have been

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,439
the real alternative news<font color="#E5E5E5"> an unfocused I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">try not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to catch your hold of what</font>

36
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,790
flashed across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen and held for</font>

37
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,729
an instant capture<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was like a baby</font>

38
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,909
photo of me and then with two brothers

39
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,430
depth in nappies and it was me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

40
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,829
watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> them my life channel and my</font>

41
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,810
whole life up to then all the things I

42
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,640
had forgotten all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">changed all the times I said I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

44
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,628
hero I saw me meet my<font color="#E5E5E5"> wife to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be I saw</font>

45
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:12,060
the girls that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had loved I saw my</font>

46
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,620
primitive style of

47
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,349
and I saw the petty arguments and

48
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:18,810
terrible accidents I had no time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

49
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,690
react to even recognize so many emotions

50
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,840
I saw my mother died again<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jonathan</font>

51
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,690
arrived late again that's funeral in the

52
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,909
bush tears streaked face of Michael

53
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:32,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Takacs all trusted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> past and there was no</font>

54
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,519
pause and there was no rewind there was

55
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,190
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one camera angle looking down and</font>

56
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,950
so I saw myself go bald and I saw my son

57
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,140
grow so tall and as I witnessed the

58
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,750
snatches of us approach today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font>

59
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,700
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it would stop but it didn't</font>

60
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I turned away in fear and as the</font>

61
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:51,180
planes wheels left the tarmac the screen

62
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,200
