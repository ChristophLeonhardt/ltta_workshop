“My name’s Corin Hardy.
I’m the director of "The Nun."
So I’m going to tell you a
little bit about this scene,
which takes place about
a third of the way
into the movie.
Father Burke, played
by Demián Bichir,
has just been woken up in the
dead of night while staying
in a convent.
And he’s woken by the sound
of a child’s footsteps,
which he follows into
the cemetery outside
to discover
something which has
haunted his past in the
form of a boy called Daniel.
Now the evil
forces are messing
with the minds of our
characters, playing tricks.
So they want to
dispatch Burke.
And he ends up in this coffin.
This was a single shot on
a crane, which we performed
the first half of of the
fall up to the gravestone,
and then with a
vision effects join,
performed the
second part of it.
So it appears that
he’s buried alive.
Now he’s able to ring a bell
to alert Sister Irene, played
by Taissa Farmiga.
This concept’s based
on a real concept.
During the plague, if
someone was buried alive,
they would be able
to have a bell
to ring to alert people
that they were still alive
underground.
Pretty creepy.
So she’s come out to try
and find where he is.
And now the second part of the
supernatural forces messing
with our characters comes when
she hears a number of bells
and can’t determine
which grave he’s in.
But she has holy
super power, and is
able to use her visions
and tune into the bells
to find which coffin
Burke is buried in.
I wanted to use this scene
to maximize and amplify
the tension around the
concept of being buried alive
in a coffin.
So first of all, this idea
of claustrophobia, and not
being able to be found.
But I thought it
could be even more
terrifying if
there was something
in the coffin with you.
So Burke is trying
to find out what
is down there whilst Irene is
trying to get to him in time.
I wanted to time this
scare to find out
what’s in the coffin
with him just right."
"(SCREAMING) Irene!"
