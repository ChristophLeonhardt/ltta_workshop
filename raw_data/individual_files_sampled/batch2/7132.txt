so we've been talking about CNN's list of the the most what they think of the most likely presidential contenders of 2020 we've been talking a little bit about our own list and some of the people that might be on our list I brought up Nina Turner I brought up Tulsi Gabbard now and then I was just talking before the break about electability and how and I'm legitimately wrestling with this you know to what degree do you want someone who has some electability a threshold of electability that permits them to be part of the conversation and so these are the things that I wrestle with you know I could be like saying well you know my dad would be a great president because he's really right on all the policies he understands the legislative process perfectly well mark your dad isn't gonna win so can we find somebody else who maybe maybe be more relevant of the conversation I don't mean to diminish any of the candidates or the names we're talking about Sheryl I think it it is part of this that is to say someone's viability as a presidential candidate so I have a few thoughts on this so first of all you know when people say oh well Bernie couldn't have won in this here's the thing a Republican populist I put that in air quotes because that is in fact an oxymoron but Donald Trump ran on this false idea of right-wing populism and people bought into it right people bought into it people in the Rust Belt bought into it so it's not unrealistic to think that if a fake populist one a real populist couldn't win it's actually very realistic to say a real populist would win because the Democrats didn't put up in actual grassroots populist against Donald Trump they put up the most establishment candidate maybe ever in the history of the party and she lost so the idea of real populism something a Nina Turner brings something a Tulsi Gabbard brings something a Bernie Sanders brings it's certainly I think very realistic to say that that could win in 2020 another thing as far as just practicality using Tulsi as a for instance Tulsi Gabbard she is an excellent speaker first of all has the policy ideas and she has a military background that's going to appeal now when I say that's gonna appeal to a lot of people and I don't mean the moderate Republicans the the people talk to Chuck Schumer talks about I mean the people that really feel like voting doesn't matter like it's not gonna make their lives better because they've suffered under 40 years in neoliberalism and they're just tired I think those people a tulsi gabbard really has an opportunity to appeal to those types of people okay and she's a young woman oh she's well-spoken she's totally likable and she's got the ideas she was terrific I think somebody like that is the full package now the establishment doesn't want her but in Neen attorney you could a lot of the same things are very true for Nina Turner I don't think me Anna Turner has a military background at least not to my knowledge but all the same things are true to her yeah I was just thing as you said a military background of what they did to John Kerry I still can't believe that John Kerry hood legitimately went to Vietnam this guy took bullets in Vietnam and their guys dying all around him okay he comes back he runs against a war or military evader okay in George Bush I mean he technically signed up for some Texas National Guard or whatever but Ray and and somehow the powers associated with the GOP machine were able to demonize John Kerry sufficiently to suggest that he wasn't a military hero and I mean this is a guy he went to effing Vietnam usually you know he's from a wealthy family or wealthy enough he could have gotten out of the wars he had three pair of hearts thank you yeah yeah so so as you say there is there's a lot about him I don't like but but yeah but but all I'm thinking about is how effectively the GOP machine eviscerates Democratic candidates and some of them deserve to be eviscerated for various reasons but it's who can survive that process that industry of politics it's brutal oh absolutely I mean and this kind of goes into the deeper issue of I I really would love to see I would really love to see a country where our political seasons quote unquote are much different are way shorter for his sensor about about six weeks our policy based are just kind of back and forth sparring kind of like what they do in England that's right right they they have it way better now they're not perfect the BBC is not perfect politics over they're not perfect I'm not suggesting they are with a lot less money there's a lot less money and it's a much more transparent thing it's a much more issues based sparring back and forth and there's a couple understood truths they have that I really wish we had over here I mean you can find footage of Teresa may you know the right wing and Jeremy Corbyn debating about the NHS at least they have an agreement that the NHS should exist you know I mean she has some right wing ideas that would definitely harm it but they're in agreement that the NHS should exist if you brought that over to the United States we would have the Paul Ryan wing and basically just the Republicans in general and some Democrats that would argue that something like that shouldn't even exist yeah the the thing that happens here and again I'll go back to it for the last time if it doesn't make sense like the length of the political season doesn't make sense it's about money and here's how it works in the length of political season the things that benefit from the a lengthy political season are associated oftentimes and largely with media because you need to get out there with a media presence you need to make all kinds of media buys you need to do a number of things associated with launching a movement for your candidacy over a long period of time that's a lot of money so for example in this in the case of that media local television stations and radio stations but particularly television they benefit enormously they almost live political season two political scene right so they depend on a long campaign and and they are their real power so and they're just that's just one thing the length of the political season works is is a part and works for that political machine and that I think mitigates ever they're being changes in the way we do politics at least in that regard in this country oh yeah totally I mean it's just money it's well that's that worth pointing out because you know it benefits the media even in the independent sector so what we're actually saying right now actually hurts our own interests as content creators but nonetheless and we certainly don't to see what the corporate media sees I mean it's it's it's very much apples and oranges but there is still like a vague connection and so but still I'd rather have a better political season with better candidates than the circus we have now of course but you're right the horse race the longer it is benefits it benefits all these even down to the independent just so you know we're being totally transparent where we're at hey I hope you enjoyed this clip there's a whole hour
