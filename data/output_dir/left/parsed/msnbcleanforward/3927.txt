American journalism all of it is the
best anywhere in the world this land
contains an incredible quality and
quantity of good common sense and it's
in no danger being led down the primrose
path by a journalist at the risk of
sounding presumptuous I would say to all
of you be patient and have courage for
there will be better and happier news
one day if we work at it
