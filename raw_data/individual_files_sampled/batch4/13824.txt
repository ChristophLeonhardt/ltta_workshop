on Monday Marvel Comics admitted what those of us who actually read comic books have known all along the emphasis on leftist messaging in comic books is pretty much killing the appeal David Gabriel is the vice president of sales at Marvel and he said the comic book retailers were reporting a drop-off in interest in the new diversity oriented comics he said quote what we heard was that people didn't want any more diversity didn't want female characters out there that's what we heard whether we believe that or not I don't know if that's really true but that's what we saw in sales any character that was diverse any character that was new our female characters anything that was not a core Marvel character people were turning their nose up okay it's not racism and sexism driving people away from Marvel it's a feeling of irritation the classic characters are being redrawn and recast in order to assuage the feelings of social justice warriors Ironman is Tony Stark he is not riri Williams Captain America is Steve Rogers he is not Sam Wilson Thor is Thor not female Thor spider-man is Peter Park it not Miles Morales this isn't to say that the comments with Miles Morales aren't good they're actually really good if you read them although the Iron Man series was really root with really will Williams actually kind of sucked it's to say that nobody wants to see iconic superheroes recast as completely different people to appease quotas on race and sex superheroes are brands you can't twist those grounds without hurting them when it comes to new superheroes people are always skeptical so this poses something of a challenge how do you better reflect diversity in comments without tanking sales if that's something you want to do the answer you have to make new characters awesome then worry about whether they're diverse later or use a historic character to infuse new life so Marvel did the ladder with blit with black panther they hire Donaghy C codes to write the comic which immediately became a big bestseller for them this year they comment by the way he's actually unreadable bad but at least Marvel tried doing diversity the right way here in the DC Universe Harley Quinn who is a marginal character 20 years ago is now a major bestseller because she's interesting not because Batman had to become that woman but the comic book industry keeps attempting to slam its constituents over the head with social justice messaging and that's actually killing the quality of comics see for example Batman advocate for Trayvon Martin or Captain America illegal immigration defender both of which happened last year turning iconic characters into avatars of social justice actually kill sales it's throwback comics doing most of the heavy lifting at this point Marvel and DC should take note that it's not American racism driving that choice it's Americans discontent with the LA willingness to sacrifice quality and legacy for leftist politics and ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show all right so we're gonna get to the big breaking news that is happening right now in just a second something that is really bad for the Obama administration and pretty good for Team

it actually broke a little bit over the weekend but now it's been confirmed from Eli Lake at Bloomberg so originally it was broken with mics Serna vich for some reason the White House is now funneling stories to Mike Serna vich which makes very little sense because he has very little credibility but oh I like them confirmed it and so did Maggie Haberman over at the New York Times there she did the legwork so Eli Lake of Bloomberg has now reported that Barack Obama's national security adviser Susan Rice repeatedly requested information from the Intel community on members of the Trump transition team and campaign unmasking them to an audience beyond the Intel community in the process now normally when you get a raw Intel feed and you're a member of the political branches they basically black out all of the people who are American citizens caught up in the in the Intel so let's say listening to the Russian embassy and they are talking to Mike Flynn the Intel one it is provided to people like Susan Rice will say Russian ambassador was talking to US citizen one right it'll just black it out because it's not important if there's no crime being committed for people to know who this is because they're afraid of exactly this sort of thing the whole point of masking is to prevent the dissemination of information about innocent Americans who are not actually doing anything criminal so what happened is that apparently according to Lake in February the National Security Council Senior Director for Intelligence Elliot Cohen wat neck discovered Rice's multiple requests to unmask US persons in intelligence reports that are related to trump transition activities he brought this to the attention of the White House general counsel's office who reviewed more of Rice's requests and instructed him to end his own research into the unmasking policy the intelligence reports were summaries of monitored conversations primarily between foreign officials discussing the Trump transition but also in some cases direct contact between members of the Trump team and monitored foreign officials one US official familiar with the reports said they contain valuable political information on the Trump transition such as whom the Trump team was meeting the views of Trump associates on foreign policy matters and plans for the incoming administration now just last month Susan Rice is on TV and she denied she knew anything about members of the Trump transition team being caught up in incidental intelligence gathering that now appears to be a lie as you I like also points out the revelation that requests were that rice requested the documents would also help explain why house Intel chair Devin Nunez went to the White House a couple of weeks ago because he could only see the logs about rice was doing not from Congress he actually had to go to the White House to do that because that's where she used to work it would also explain why Adam Schiff the the Democrat on the House Intelligence Islands over the weekend after seeing those documents at the White House this is a huge story for the Trump White House now doesn't mean that Trump was right to say that he was wire tapped by the Obama administration no there's still no evidence that he was wire tapped by the Obama administration there is however tremendous evidence now and in his building day by day that the Obama administration was seeking to compile all of the intelligence information in which the Trump team was incidentally swept up and then disseminated it broadly which led to being leaked that is a scandal that is the Obama administration targeting from team officials that is the Obama administration any sort of evidence of nefarious activity targeting the Trump team they're not doing it specifically by by saying we're gonna plant a wire in Trump's office which is the next step but it is them saying we have a higher level of suspicion and we're gonna unmask Trump team members in the process which is truly a big story it's a really big story actually and the media have been ignoring that story in favor of focusing in on Team Trump which is really silly because again the only evidence we have no evidence on Trump Russia we have no evidence that Obama wiretapped Trump well we do have evidence of again and being very specific about this because I want to be truthful and I want to be clear I am like so many others in this field I actually care about what is true and what the facts are as opposed to what backs a particular narrative so Trump's narrative that Obama was wiretapping him or surveilling him that is not true he was not being wiretapped or surveilled in targeted fashion he was being targeted in targeted fashion by Susan Rice according to this report the national security adviser under Obama who is always the fall person right she's always the person they tried out to do the dirty work because she's an Obama loyalist she was in fact unmasking all of the Trump team officials by going to the Intel community and requesting raw intelligence be provided to her and then disseminating that apparently broadly it was widely dispersed across the government that meant lots of people knew that Mike Flynn was talking to US Ambassador certitudes Russian ambassador so to get his Lea act which of course led to Flynn's resignation eventually and all of this on the basis of nothing because there's still two questions that haven't been answered one what exactly did anybody do wrong I mean I haven't seen the Trump team actually do anything wrong at this point it looks like all the stuff that Flynn did that was that was nasty and terrible he was doing two years ago he wasn't doing well he was a member of the Trump team that's number one and the number two if team Trump knew about this and apparently the White House general counsel's office knew about it why didn't they just declassify this information and blow it out there why instead tried to get it to Nunez wine said try to funnel it through House Intel maybe the idea here is that they knew that they had their trust compromised with the American people and then if they trotted this out everybody would accuse them of bias so instead they tried to funnel it out through the House Intelligence Committee maybe that's what's going on but that's a question that has yet to be answer and then of course the last question is a small one but an annoying one which is why in the world is the Trump administration trying to leak information to places like Infowars and Zero Hedge and Serna vechio hedge is actually much better than Infowars answer 'no much why are they using them as the outlets as opposed to you know if you're gonna leak then leak to two outlets that have a higher level of public trust I mean forget about what I think of those outlets those are not outlets with a high level of public trust if you're gonna leak leak to somebody like you I like who actually has a level of public trust well all of this is leading the Democrats to sheer panic because they do not actually have anything here it's it's kind of fascinating the left keeps focusing in on Trump Russia and Adam Schiff representative chef he basically admitted we've got nothing I mean there's there's no hard evidence linking Trump to Russian collusion this is whether or not there was collusion among members of the Trump campaign or surrounding the Trump campaign Trump advisors can you say definitively that there was collusion there were people affiliated with the Trump campaign who were working with Russians to time the release of damaging information about Hillary Clinton that event that had been hacked either from John Podesta or the DNC I don't think we can say anything definitively at this point we are still at the very early stage of the investigation the only thing I can say is that it would be irresponsible for us not to get to the bottom of this we really need to do we really need to find out exactly what the Russians did because one of the most important conclusions that the intelligence community reached is that they are going to do this again to the United States they're doing it already in Europe so we can say you know conclusively this is something that needs to be thoroughly investigated but but it's way premature to be reaching conclusions and and basically they're he's saying no we don't have any evidence of this whatsoever so what exactly are you gonna do about it I mean the left has nothing here they have nothing here and Sarah Huckabee Sanders who's been bashed around a lot for not being a particularly great surrogate she's exactly right when she says the media are talking about something of which there is very little evidence at this point the media constantly wants to talk about something that doesn't exist instead of something that does we have been we've spent the last couple of months doing major policy initiatives and rollouts in the forms of executive order rolling back regulations creating an environment where businesses are confident in higher we've heard from CEO after CEO small business owner that they're excited about this president they're excited about the economy and yet the media refuses to cover that but they're more than happy to talk about a story frankly that is just faking it so in any case the Democrats are panicking over all of this and so their language is becoming more and more extreme excuse me on all of this so you have the newark Mayor who's now coming out and he's trying to say that Trump is is like a slave catcher right they're just getting more and more extreme because they're they're panicking which is weird they're they shouldn't be panicking Trump's approval ratings for like 35% right now but by the same token there's nothing that they've got on Trump it's hard evidence they actually this is the thing they're not content to live with Trump being an unpopular president instead they are trying to go for the kill shot and they don't have the kill shots they're becoming more desperate so here are the Democrats struggling here's New York's mayor saying that Trump is basically like a fugitive slave catcher well I think that them targeting sanctuary cities is a way for them to tell mayors and other folks you know around the country one that they're sticking to what I think is a very unconstitutional and unamerican policy and trying to intimidate us into being what I've called fugitive slave catches the runaround and do their bidding in our cities and if we refuse to do that then it makes it difficult for them to continue their policy because they don't have the resources to kind of run down all of the undocumented residents locally the desperation is setting in that is pathetic okay the fact is that illegal immigrants are not slaves in the United States who are attempting to escape bondage which is against both God's law and man's law okay the idea that people who are coming into the country illegally and we don't know who they are that you shouldn't be helping out the feds to figure out who they are that's just absurd but this is the this is the language that is escalating now the Democrats think that because Trump won their answer is to escalate their language they don't understand that the reason that Trump won I just spent some time in Pennsylvania and I just spent some time in Indiana and I just spent I'm spending time now in Florida the reason that Trump won is because there's a whole group of people in America who feel like they were forgotten by the Democrats because the Democrats were too focused on inflammatory language dividing American from American to worry about their jobs to worry about their lives that's the reason why Trump won but the Democrats are and they're looking at Trump and instead of seeing that Trump appealed to a certain number of people who felt forgotten by the Democrats instead they they think that Trump won because Trump was loud and so they're just getting louder so here's Nancy Pelosi getting even louder and more obnoxious well it has always been Paul Ryan's agenda if you look at the Ryan budget of the last couple of congress's before now you will see that the the agenda Donald Trump's hang on to that I think when he does not come the nominee of the party he bought into the deconstruction of government the radical right-wing agenda I don't even know if Donald Trump will go as far as the Republicans in Congress people say well how long will it take for the Republicans in Congress to say enough donald trump i said don't wait for that because their agenda is very similar to his if you look at their budget over the last few years if you look at their opposition to anything to do with the environment climate change in the rest if you look at their anti-woman agenda LGBT agenda you name it they've been there ok so again getting more and more extreme in the rhetoric now what this may help them do what this may help them do is win back the house and Nancy Pelosi did this in the aftermath of Bush winning in 2004 after 2004 she got more and more extreme and right now Trump is cruisin for a bruisin in the house he's probably gonna keep the Senate because there are too many Democratic seats up for play but in 2018 the House races do not look good for Republicans right now when the when the President of the United States is below 40% the chances that he's going to retain the house become lower and lower but again the Democrats are just gonna get more extreme in their language that's not going to help defeat Trump it is going to help drive his approval ratings down Tom Perez did the same thing he's the the chair of the DNC will play him in just a second but first I want to

come to you as opposed to you having to go sit in the lobby similar and wait for your appointment to come up okay so Tom Perez is the head of DNC and he like Nancy Pelosi like this New York mayor he thinks that the way Democrats are gonna win is by mirroring Trump's rhetoric rather than mirroring Trump's positioning with regard to blue-collar workers so here's Tom Perez ranting about the GOP and then he starts cursing as well now a lot of people on the right been saying oh how dare he curse I don't know forms the president we don't get to say how dare he Curtis anymore okay that cat is long out of the bag but it does demonstrate the Democrats as always take exactly the wrong lessons out of their loss instead of figuring out that they need to appeal to the same people that Trump won away from the Obama acolytes they they instead have decided to double down on his sort of rhetoric now as we continue here I want to talk about Donald Trump's credibility what Donald Trump is doing right
