the left censorship of conservatives has now kicked into high gear google has placed at least 21 videos from Prager University an educational nonprofit designed to tell young people about conservative issues of interest in restricted mode preventing young people from seeing them Google admitted that they quote take into consideration what the intent of the video is meaning they're happy to shut down anyone who presents political positions they just don't like meanwhile Peter Thiel a Silicon Valley investment guru who spoke at the RNC his faced serious backlash calls to oust him from the board of Facebook have grown over the past few weeks the New York Times reported just yesterday quote the news last week that mr. field was given 1.25 millions of the Republicans campaign is provoking outrage and tech executives who work with the billionaire investors are beginning for are being forced to explain why they plan to continue to do business with him unquote to his credit Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg who is a hardcore Democrat defended the only said we care deeply about diversity that's easy to say what I mean standing up for ideas you agree with it's a lot harder when it means standing up for the rights of people with different viewpoints to say what they care about that's even more important but that's what prominent leftist will say publicly how many of them will continue to do business with Thiel without external pressure forcing them to do so how many of them will quietly kill business deals how many of them will shut Thiel out making him an outsider in his own industry leftists have been doing this for years that's how mozilla firefox' CEO Brandon I ended up L stood over supporting traditional marriage it's why Democratic mayor's from Boston to Chicago threatened chick-fil-a for its ownership support of traditional marriage it's why Hollywood Republicans get blacklisted for even the mildest form of conservatism is why speakers like me get banned from college campuses the left is fuscia stick in their approach to interpersonal relations it's not enough to disagree with somebody that person must be excised from polite society so that means the right has to fight back there are two ways you can do that first you can give to organizations like Prager you which is a really great place that have been victimized by the left second turnabout is fair play leftists must feel the pain of mutually assured destruction the second tactic is something Republicans are always loathe to do since it's something with which we kind of disagree but if the left isn't made to understand that a polite society relies on a basic agreement between all of the parties not to destroy one another based on political differences they'll continue to destroy the right while we continue pay them to do so the right has been using its market power to fight the left by turning off the TV with regard to the NFL conservatives can do this more broadly and more specifically it's harsh it's nasty it's necessary in a world built by the left and yes rigged to the detriment of those who disagree I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show okay so you apologized

Baxley use the slash Ben so that people know that we sent you and they continue to advertise with us which makes this show possible and all of the technical abilities that we've demonstrated today so we've is hoping we begin today with the collapse of Obamacare so the Democrats the the the craziness surrounding Trump Clinton has overshadowed everything in the world but the Democrats are truly collapsing Obamacare is toast the the premiums are rising dramatically they were always designed to do this now the Democrats are panicking a little bit because they realize there's a backlash and Obamacare isn't popular but Obamacare was always designed to do this see the regime of Obamacare was the idea that we were going to find basically young healthy people into buying insurance and they would buy they paid really really expensive insurance that they don't need in order to redistribute that insurance coverage to old people who are already sick and have pre-existing conditions that was the basic notion behind Obamacare that young people who are earning an income we're going to pay for older people and and poorer people that was the idea and Medicaid was going to be expanded in the states the federal government would pick up a lot of the lot of the requirements at the beginning but sooner or later the states would take over this expanded Medicaid burden so that poor people could join Medicaid for free and that would count as Obamacare that was part of the part of the routine well a lot of the states said we're not expanding Medicaid we're not going you can't force us to do that and we're not going to do that and you can all go stick it what that's meant is skyrocketing premiums for young people skyrocketing premiums for a lot of people who want a better plan because their doctors no longer covered under the new Obamacare plans it's meant that a lot of services are covered now that don't have to be like for example I believe that under the new Obamacare rules every person is eligible to receive a breast pump which works great for my wife since she's nursing it doesn't work as well for me since I'm not but Obamacare is filled with these kind of stupidities the idea was that they were going to destroy the the insurance industry where it stands so they get the insurance industry on board the insurance industry says Obamacare is wondrous it's great look at all these new signups and then they'd have to raise the rates because it turns out that you can't keep the rates low while you're paying for people with pre-existing conditions and then the next step would be okay we need a government option well now we're reaching the point where people on the Left they're saying now we get to go to the inevitable next step it's government option time because obviously the insurance markets can't keep up with all these new requirements we've put on them because they're evil and greedy not because the requirements are stupid but because worried because they're evil and greedy so now Obama's trying to make that case and he accidentally makes the worst case for Obamacare in history when one of these companies comes out with a new smartphone then it has a few bugs what do they do they fix it they upgrade unless it catches fire then they just then they pulled off harder but you don't go back to using a rotary phone he's real he's he realized this halfway through that joke that he just made a big boo-boo that's why he pauses there because what he's saying he just compared Obamacare to the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 which has been exploding like literally melting down and bursting into flames it's been banned on airplanes and he even he admits it he says you know when when something burst into flames you have to recall it right like Obamacare but he's actually arguing for however is that we should all and instead of worrying about the Samsung Galaxy Note seven we should stick it up to our face burn off our skin and then we should replace it with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 government sponsored Edition and they say look there's nothing worth defending and Obamacare it's a garbage plan it always was a garbage plan and now it's failing because Obama wanted it to fail and he's embarrassed by it so he's gonna try and blame it on somebody else meanwhile Hillary Clinton is having trouble too yesterday she was at a press conference or she was your she was at some sort of event and one of the reporters asked her about James O'Keefe and these allegations that people were in her employ were attempting to create violence at Trump rallies and were participating in voter fraud the guys standing behind her by the way is John Podesta alpha-male John Podesta here's Hillary Clinton dressed in Christian Bale's outfit from equilibrium and and here she's asked us have question here's what she does if they are found to have you know I know nothing about this I'm not you know I can't deal with every one of his conspiracy theories but I hope you all have something to eat and something to drink on the way back to New York run off the plane while to the middle of the flight I say saying that they're all running from this now to be fair Trump is also running from questions who's asked yesterday by a reporter not about specific allegations but about the idea that he's a sexist in a racist and here's how Trump treated it oh we don't have it okay fine so Trump ran from questions as well in any case that's one from Twitter I think and Twitter's down so ruining everything but in any case Trump ran from some questions as well all this was was pre allude to the Al Smith dinner so the Al Smith dinner is this routine they have in New York City every I think they have it every year I would assume but every four years is when it gets publicized because the presidential nominees show up to do a comedy bit and it's a charity event so that makes it acceptable if it were not a charity bet I would really dislike this event as much as I dislike the White House press Correspondents Dinner which I really really dislike the so-called nerd prom all of these these fancy people with their fancy suits and their tuxes all pretending to love each other and demonstrating that there is a super elite in our country who hobnob with each other you sort of get the same feeling from the Al Smith dinner but at least they're attempting to raise money for charity normally at the Al Smith dinner the idea is that the two candidates get up and they sort of softly rip each other while making self-deprecating jokes right supposed to be kind of a yes we're getting near the election but we're all Americans and we can all laugh at ourselves and isn't this fun right sort of a respite from the from the normal political rigmarole and in past days it's easier to have good feelings about people on the other side when you feel like you have something in common with them the reason that we watch comedies and theatres and you don't watch comedy movies alone is because when everybody is laughing it creates a feeling of community it's very hard to do comedy in a place where there's no feeling of community okay so the Al Smith net at the Al Smith dinner last night after having destroyed the electoral cycle and and politics generally and decency and truth and hope Hillary and and Trump turned to destroying comedy and then they take it out back and shoot it like Old Yeller so Donald Trump starts off and he starts off with some jokes that are sort of self-deprecating nothing nothing really strict and as you'll see they'd say you know let's call a good Trump bad Trump because this is good Trump bad Trump if we've got the theme oh yeah everybody's excited about good Trump antrum so you
