welcome back the president is inviting Vladimir Putin to the White House this fall as the White House today tries to clean up another controversy from president Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin earlier this week a proposal to let Russian authorities interrogate Americans in exchange for letting Muller's teams sit in on questioning of 12 intelligence officers indicted for 2016 election hacking President Trump said on Monday that it was a quote incredible offer yesterday the White House didn't rule it out but now the White House says quote it is it is a proposal that was made in sincerity by President Putin but president Trump disagrees with it the Kremlin's critics the Clinton the Kremlin critics that Putin wants in wants wants excuse me include a familiar face to many of our viewers MSNBC analyst and former US ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul also built Browder an american-born British businessman but Putin singled out Browder at that press conference who's led a human rights campaign resulting in sanctions against the Kremlin and now Vladimir Putin wants to get his hands on him bill Browder joins me now bill I guess we should say Letterman Putin has wanted to get his hands on you for quite some time it's not just now what do you think of the president inviting Putin to the White House this fall well III didn't think that the that Donald Trump should have given Putin the benefit of sitting on a stage with him in Helsinki and I don't think that he should give him the benefit of of a state visit the United States Vladimir Putin is a menace to the world he's invaded Ukraine he's shot down passenger planes with innocent people on them he's killed innocent women and children in Syria he's meddled with elections spreading chemical weapons around the center of England this guy is a global menace and to invite him to Washington after sitting on a stage as equals in Helsinki is this enormous gift to Vladimir Putin that that he does the flattery Putin absolutely doesn't deserve doesn't make you personally nervous that he's inviting him after all the White House said yesterday that they were considering allowing Putin and Russians to to question you and some other American citizens well it doesn't make me particularly nervous although my accent betrays it 29 years ago I emigrated to London I'm a British citizen and so it's not as if he has jurisdiction over me and furthermore to the extent that when I am in America the United States is a is a rule of law country the courts or the courts have power over the over the government and and I don't think that anything untoward would happen to me but but it does bother me that Vladimir Putin is getting all these free gifts of credibility when he should be contained not flattered and engaged you said that you do live in Britain so I guess the president should have been asking a different head of state if you really wanted to talk to you Theresa mail though she probably wouldn't be so apt to give him give you to him given what happened on her soil with the poisoning of the ex Russian spy but just talk to us a little bit about what sort of security measures you've put in place for yourself are you worried about your safety generally well the first thing I should point out is that although the world has seen Vladimir Putin's anger towards me in the last few days this has been going on for five years and so what what I mean he his anger is a no different level now than it was five years ago he's very angry he's been very angry he's angry at me for the Magnitsky Act and he wants to destroy me to kill me to arrest me and he's been trying these things for a number of years and so yes I do have many security measures in place the most important security measure though is legal security I only go to countries where governments will support me and not hand me over to Vladimir Putin that's the really limits to your travel I would assume well not really no I mean there are not there are a number of like the rule of law countries around the world yeah but your countries they can put out an alert on Interpol well that happened to me about not six weeks ago I was in Madrid Spain Russia put out an Interpol arrest warrant the Spanish police acted on it arrested me but two hours later I was released and and so I don't think that I would have been back to Russia from Madrid but let's say I had been in man I don't know Dubai I'm sure the those guys would be happy to give Vladimir Putin a little gift you say Vlad Emir Putin is upset at you about the Magnitsky Act which is all the sanctions that have been put on those clothes - - Vladimir Putin over the years why is he also accusing you though of avoiding paying Russian tax debts and funneling money to the Clinton Foundation or I'm sorry Hillary Clinton's campaign he's also even calling you a serial killer why well he basically take they make up criminal accusations against their enemies serial killing they call me a spy they said that I stole 4.8 billion dollars of IMF money which was destined for Russia in 1998 they just throw this stuff out like candy against their enemies they just may they basically in order to try to discredit people who are fighting fighting corruption or fighting for human rights they just try to criminalize them it's a standard operating procedure they do it every single person who's a human rights activist they the more effective of human rights activists you are the more of these allegations they throw out there thankfully they don't stick in the West but that is his modus operandi why exactly is he so upset at you explain why the magnet Magnitsky Act has gotten under his skin after all our viewers will will know that that that act and find that familiar because that's what the guise of what the Donald Trump jr. meeting with the Russian lawyer was about in Trump Tower in 2016 so it all comes back to the to the fundamental principle that Vladimir Putin is a very corrupt head of state a kleptocrat and what that means is he's stolen a lot of money from the Russian people through many many different crimes and schemes some of those crimes and schemes required him to either take hostage or kill businessmen or people who stood in his way and so as a result of this he's done two things committed a lot of crimes and accumulated a lot of money and the money that he's accumulated sits in bank accounts in the West and what the Magnitsky Act does is it says anybody who's involved in gross human rights abuses and have their money seized and so it applies directly to that a person to the vladimir putin type of person who's committed crimes and has a lot of money and invited Putin's case he thinks and he's not unrealistic and thinking this that his offshore wealth is at risk because of actions that I've taken and because of he could potentially be sanctioned under the Magnitsky Act bill Browder bill thank you so much for being with us today we do appreciate it hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more meet the press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you on youtube subscribe now
