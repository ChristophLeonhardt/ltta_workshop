1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
Some things in life are surprising

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,540
But did you know that most alcohol beverages

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,480
contain all 13 minerals necessary to sustain your life?

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,760
or that approximately one percent of the world's population

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,620
is drunk at any given moment?

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,440
maybe you're one of them.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,480
Or how about the fact that a single sperm has

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,460
has the equivalent of 37.5 megabytes of DNA information in it?

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,460
This  means that a normal ejaculation

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,760
acquaints to a data transfer of over 1500 terabytes.

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,740
Tell that to an iguana, koala or Komodo dragon

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,820
which all have two penises.

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,740
Or better yet, the kangaroo

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,800
which actually has three vaginas.

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,300
The male octopus, on the other hand

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,380
often tears of its mating arm

17
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,220
places it inside the female

18
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,620
and then swims off somewhere to die.

19
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,580
How romantic.

20
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,140
The average person walks the equivalent of three times

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,180
around the world in a lifetime.

22
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,800
Meanwhile, if the population of China walk pass you in a single foul line

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,640
it would take about 30 years

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,380
considering the rate of reproduction.

25
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,800
but after only 2 weeks,

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,360
a pair of their pants will have grown 1000 bacteria on the front

27
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,900
2500 on the back, and 10,000 on the crotch.

28
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,500
And did you know that the Apple iPhone is the

29
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,800
second best-selling product of all time,

30
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,080
after the Rubik's cube?

31
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:21,840
which actually has 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 possible configurations.

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,460
Much like a deck of cards, which, when shuffled

33
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,260
will result in a configuration that has never existed ever before.

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,960
How can this be?

35
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,900
The simple mathematical calculation shows that

36
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,420
the possible arrangements of a deck of cards

37
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,460
are monumental

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,680
Or how about the fact that

39
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,640
oxygen is required for combustion

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,840
and hydrogen is flammable gas, but together,

41
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,220
they make water, which puts fire out.

42
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,360
Before the eraser was invented,

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,580
bread was used to remove pencil marks,

44
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,780
while peanut butter, under extremely high pressure,

45
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,520
can be turned into diamonds?

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,460
That's...one useful sandwich.

47
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,620
And if you feel like a warm cup of coffee with that,

48
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,920
Try yelling for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days

49
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,920
which should produce enough sound energy

50
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,860
to heat your coffee up.

51
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,300
Strange as it may be, the brain actually named itself

52
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,860
and finally, a physicist studying atoms,

53
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,520
is really just atoms trying to understand themselves.

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,820
Got a burning question you want to answer?

00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,040
