1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,170
I know all of us here today
and across the entire nation

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,320
are grieving for the
community of Parkland

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,410
in the great state
of Florida.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,930
We must do more to
protect our children.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,530
We have to do more to
protect our children.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,900
After the deadly
shooting in Las Vegas,

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,590
I directed the attorney
general to clarify

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,220
whether certain bump stock
devices like the one used

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,020
in Las Vegas are illegal
under current law.

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:37,270
That process began in December.
And just a few moments ago,

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,550
I signed a memorandum
directing the attorney general

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,520
to propose regulations
to ban all devices that

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,200
turn legal weapons
into machine guns.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,930
I expect that these
critical regulations will

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:00,000
be finalized — Jeff — very soon.”
