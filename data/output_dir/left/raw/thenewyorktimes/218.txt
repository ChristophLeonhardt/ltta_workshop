1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,890
History is made as Kim Jong-un
crosses the border.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,780
It’s the first time
a North Korean leader

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,660
has set foot in the South.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,430
This step is the latest chapter
in Kim’s head-spinning makeover

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,410
from a stern-faced despot
into a smiling diplomat.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,280
Somebody President Trump
ridiculed as “Little Rocket Man” —

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,380
“Rocket Man is on
a suicide mission

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,380
for himself” —

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,560
has suddenly
become “very honorable.”

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,360
“He really has been very
open, very honorable.”

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,070
Here is how Kim did it.

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,980
Kim may have felt that
he had the leverage

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,830
to turn a diplomatic corner
once he was able to show

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,230
that his country could
be a nuclear power.

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,960
Kim kicks off his charm offensive

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,970
by dispatching his
so-called army of beauties

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,220
to the Winter
Olympics in Pyeongchang.

18
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,730
He also sends his sister
Kim Yo-jong — the first time

19
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,130
a member of the Kim family
visited South Korea

20
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,870
since the Korean War.

21
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,560
She becomes an overnight
sensation in the South.

22
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,750
Kim hosts a delegation of
high-level South Korean officials

23
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,220
in Pyongyang.

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,440
The officials from the
South deliver a bombshell

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,670
to the White House:

26
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,090
Kim wants to meet Trump,
and Trump, shocking the world,

27
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,010
says yes.

28
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,870
“Trump responded saying yes.”

29
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,460
“Surprise, praise, skepticism.”

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,840
“This was indeed a shocker.”

31
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,120
Kim secretly leaves the
country for the first time

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,530
since taking power.

33
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,550
His destination: Beijing,
where he visits

34
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,870
with Chinese President
Xi Jinping.

35
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,600
It’s Kim’s first meeting with
another head of state.

36
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,020
Kim hosts the International
Olympic Committee

37
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,690
in Pyongyang to thank
them for their support

38
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,480
and to say that North Korea
will take part in the Tokyo

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,520
and Beijing Olympics.

40
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,180
Kim loosens North Korea’s
iron grip on pop culture as he

41
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,150
and his wife rock out at
a two-hour K-pop concert

42
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,220
in Pyongyang.

43
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,000
He even poses for a photo with
a popular South Korean girl band,

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,710
Red Velvet.

45
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,600
Kim secretly meets

46
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,320
and has a photo op with
then-C.I.A. director Mike Pompeo,

47
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,380
signaling planning
is underway for a summit.

48
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,930
North Korea announces
a new pledge

49
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,140
to end nuclear and
missile testing

50
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,340
and close a nuclear test site.

51
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,760
Kim takes his historic stroll

52
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,110
and calls for an age of peace.

53
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,930
It may mark the beginning
of a historic thaw.

54
00:02:47,930 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever happens, it’s clearly
the start of a new Kim Jong-un.
