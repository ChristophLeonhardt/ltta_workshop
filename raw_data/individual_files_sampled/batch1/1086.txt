now we're taking a look at the underbelly of supply chains on the one end you see a bar of chocolate in a shiny wrapping but let's rewind a little bit from the expensive processing and marketing the Ivory Coast and Ghana are the world's first and second biggest coca producers and many people they are so poor that they can never afford the final product so the two governments have decided to team up to get a bigger share of the global chocolate profits they say they'll coordinate production levels and sales policies and that could mean the cost of a bar of chocolate will go up candy industry publishes an annual list of the top 100 global confectionery companies ranking them by net sales in 2017 the American manufacturer Mars was ranked as the leading confectionery company in the world with sales of about 18 billion u.s. dollars Italy based Ferrero group which makes kinder and Nutella came in at number 2 and Mondelez international which makes branded chocolate such as Cadbury ranked third net sales coming in at 11 and a half billion dollars last year well joining us now via Skype from Davos Switzerland is Anthony fountain managing director of the voice Network a coalition of European NGOs and trade unions that focus on sustainable coca thanks very much for being with us so can I assume that you are in favor of what Ivory Coast and Ghana are trying to do here in terms of of getting a bigger share of the Spoils tell us why and why now in the last year and a half we've seen a major price crisis in the cocoa sector that specifically in Cote d'Ivoire has had devastating results for cocoa farmers they've seen their income reduced by about 30 37 percent overnight these farmers were already desperately poor and so measures need to be taken to address the the extreme poverty in our cocoa farmers and there's a very important role for governments to play in this the price crash was to large extent due to overproduction and so the two major coca producing nations really should work together to ensure that there is a higher cocoa price through managing the supply that might take some time before those effects start getting in but it is essential that they start moving forward to start working together and start working on a better income for cocoa farmers amongst others - pricing interventions how much power do the cocoa producers have here because in terms of taking on the chocolate industry as it currently is they are up against some powerful forces on the other side in the truck of the companies so look at the way prices are set a lot of that is done through kind of terminal markets which is a very complex set of computers basically looking at how and what's happening and so that's almost impossible to change but if you look at the fact that Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire together do about two-thirds of all of the cocoa in the world then if they would want to and if they make the right interventions they could very much impact the situation of the world's cocoa market at least in the short term medium term then it's a no-brainer that if you've got two countries that do so much cocoa of course they can have an impact if they want to the problem potentially as well though is that you have two countries there who have very different policies when it comes to the to the cocoa market they they have different ways of going about it about setting the price and so on how do you get them to cooperate well they've started working together now at least top level of trying to talk with each other which for the longest time they were direct competitors and so kind of these for these first tentative steps are good first step the question really is how is this going to work out and the mediums long term and that will require a lot more trust than they we have in each other and to be very honest I think it also require more integrity that they'll do the right thing because in the end historically speaking both nations have really tried to get the bigger piece of the pie for themselves understandably so but that that that in economic terms we talk about a zero-sum game where one person wins that the other person's loss and it doesn't work that way and they need to work together to get to a better position for their farmers from a consumer perspective is this eventually going to mean us paying more for chocolates at the at the sweet shops oh I certainly hope so because currently we're not paying for what we're buying there is a lot of hidden costs in the chocolate that we buy that were simply too cheap to pay for it cost of child labour and deforestation and extreme poverty the people hanged for that are the farmers and future generations so I certainly hope that we will end up paying more for our chocolate because we're not getting enough now appreciate you talking to us Anthony fountain joining us there from Davos thanks very much the Beeman's thank you
