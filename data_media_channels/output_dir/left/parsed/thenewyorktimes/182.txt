You may have never
heard of Kim Yong-chol.
But you’ve probably
seen him before.
Here he is sitting
next to Ivanka Trump
at the Winter Olympics
in Pyeongchang.
Here, with the
North Korean leader
at the inter-Korean
summit in April.
Here, leading a delegation
to South Korea
during military talks in 2007.
Here, with Kim Jong-il.
And here, with Secretary
of State Mike Pompeo
in Pyongyang in May.
The former head of
North Korea’s spy agency
is said to be one of Kim
Jong-un’s closest aides.
He worked for all three
leaders of the Kim dynasty,
and is one of its longest-
serving senior officials.
But he has a controversial past.
He’s still on sanctions lists in
South Korea and the United States.
South Korea accuses
Kim Yong-chol
of being involved in several
high-profile attacks.
He was allegedly
behind the sinking
of a South Korean
naval ship in 2010
that killed 46 sailors,
and of masterminding
an attack
on a South Korean island
the same year.
Under his leadership, 
North Korea’s spy agency
was suspected by the U.S.
of launching a cyberattack
against Sony Pictures in 2014.
It apparently was
in retaliation
to the film “The Interview,”
which mocked Kim Jong-un.
“I don’t need my father.”
Kim Yong-chol is also no stranger
to nuclear diplomacy.
He’s been involved in various
rounds of negotiations
to limit North Korea’s
nuclear weapons.
This week, he became 
the highest-ranking
North Korean official to visit the
United States since 2000.
