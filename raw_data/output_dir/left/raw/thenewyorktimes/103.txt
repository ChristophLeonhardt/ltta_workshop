1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,380
These are the Koch
brothers.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,490
The billionaire industrialists
are frequent targets

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,620
of Democrats
for being mega-donors

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,220
to various Republicans.

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,260
But now their powerful
political network

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,650
is taking a hard line against
President Trump’s tariffs

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,300
and threatening to
withhold support

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,820
for Republicans who support
the president on trade

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,650
and other issues.

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,630
This is a video that
Charles Koch released

11
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,760
during a retreat for
his network supporters

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,870
over the weekend.

13
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,370
“We’re seeing a rise
in protectionism.

14
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,860
The urge to protect
ourselves from change

15
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,160
has doomed many countries
throughout history.

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,520
And this protectionist
mind-set has destroyed

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,280
countless businesses as well.”

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,260
The Kochs’ new strategy
could complicate

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,470
Republicans’ efforts to
keep control of the House.

20
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,320
Recently, Koch-affiliated
political groups have pushed

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,600
back against the
president’s tariffs —

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,560
“To keep growing,
we must keep trading.

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,520
Tariffs
are not the answer.”

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,350
— sometimes reaching out to
the blue-collar demographic

25
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,285
so critical to Trump’s win
in 2016.

26
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:03,505
“Because of new tariffs

27
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:05,900
our farmers’ livelihoods
are at risk.

28
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,470
Carmakers, factory
workers and manufacturers, too.”

29
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,580
The Koch-backed
Americans for Prosperity

30
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,130
also refuse to support the
North Dakota Republican

31
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,100
Senate candidate,
Kevin Cramer,

32
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,360
who is running
against a vulnerable Democrat

33
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,430
incumbent, Heidi Heitkamp.

34
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,050
Trump took to
Twitter on Wednesday

35
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,620
to blast the Koch brothers,
calling them “a total joke,”

36
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,380
and “against strong borders
and powerful trade.”

37
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,330
The conflict is just
the latest example

38
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,430
of the rift forming
between Republicans

39
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,310
who believe in free
markets

40
00:01:34,310 --> 00:00:00,000
and a protectionist president.
