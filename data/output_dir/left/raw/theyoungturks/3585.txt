1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,460
>>YET ANOTHER STORY ABOUT
DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT A SAD, SAD

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,299
CLOWN HE IS, BUT THIS ONE IS
VERY SERIOUS.

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,299
IT COMES FROM

4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,800
GABRIEL SHERMAN AT VANITY FAIR,
I WILL QUOTE IT AT LENGTH

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,250
BECAUSE HE DID A GREAT JOB OF
FINDING SOURCES INSIDE THE WHITE

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,830
HOUSE WHO ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED
ABOUT THE MENTAL STATE OF DONALD

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,430
TRUMP.

8
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,520
FIRST LET'S REMEMBER THAT
BACK IN THE DAY HE TOLD REUTERS,

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,250
THIS WAS 98 DAYS INTO OFFICE --

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:36,340
>>WHO THINKS THE PRESIDENCY
WOULD BE EASIER?

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,379
AND HE'S LIKE,

12
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:40,950
GOLLY GEE, I WAS HAVING FUN
BEFORE AND I WAS A CLOWN, I WAS

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,879
PAID TO BE A CLOWN AND PEOPLE
WOULD PAY FOR MY NAME TO BE PUT

14
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:47,079
ON BUILDINGS, NOW I HAVE TO
ACTUALLY MANAGE THINGS IN THE

15
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,290
LAST TIME I DID THAT I
BANKRUPTED SIX DIFFERENT

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,699
COMPANIES.

17
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:55,309
SO HE IS APPARENTLY
SAD, BUT IT'S MUCH DEEPER THAN

18
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:56,309
THAT.

19
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,050
SHERMAN IS REPORTING THAT
PEOPLE INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE

20
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,179
AND CLOSE TO HIM SAY THAT TRUMP
IS --

21
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:12,900
>>THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE CLOSE TO
DONALD TRUMP SAYING THAT THEY

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,950
ARE WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

23
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,149
THEY ARE
ON HIS SIDE, BUT THEY ARE

24
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:17,149
WORRIED.

25
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:20,409
NOW, WHEN YOU GET INTO
THE DETAILS IT GETS WORSE.

26
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:21,409
SHERMAN EXPLAINS --

27
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:34,299
>>THEY THINK MAYBE THE TIPPING
POINT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CORKER

28
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:37,810
REVELATIONS, WHERE CORKER SAID
EVERYBODY IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS

29
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,619
ON PINS AND NEEDLES THAT DONALD
TRUMP IS GOING TO DRIVE OFF THE

30
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,871
ROAD AT ANY MINUTE AND THEY
SPEND THEIR WHOLE TIME TRYING TO

31
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:46,850
MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T DO GREAT
DAMAGE.

32
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,880
HE SAID IT'S ADULT DAY

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,980
CARE OVER AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

34
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,550
THE TURNING POINT IS NOT CORKER

35
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,030
SAYING IT, THE TURNING POINT IS
PEOPLE FEELING THAT WAY INSIDE

36
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,030
THE WHITE HOUSE.

37
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,490
THAT THINGS
HAVE GOTTEN EVEN WORSE, IF

38
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,369
THAT'S IMAGINABLE, AND WE WILL
GET INTO WHY IN A SECOND --

39
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:22,860
>>I DON'T GIVE A 

40
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,200
DAMN WHAT HIS
MOODS ARE, BUT I DO CARE WHAT

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,970
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE MOODS
ARE IF IT COMES TO POLICY,

42
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,830
ESPECIALLY FOREIGN POLICY AND
THE ISSUES OF WAR.

43
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,830
THEY EXPLAIN

44
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,830
WHY NOW --

45
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:58,940
>>I'M NOW GOING TO POSTULATE
THAT IT'S DEEPER THAN THAT.

46
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,940
HE

47
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,940
THOUGHT IT WAS ALL HIM.

48
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,970
HE IS
PURELY EGO DRIVEN.

49
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:03,970
IF YOU WANT

50
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,430
TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT
TRUMP, JUST THINK HOW DOES IT

51
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,500
AFFECT HIS EGO?

52
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,360
HE THOUGHT HE
COULDN'T LOSE, EVEN THOUGH HE'S

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,540
PASSED NO MAJOR LEGISLATION, HE
HAS GOT NOTHING DONE.

54
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,540
HE'S

55
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,900
FRUSTRATED BY THAT BUT HE GOES
IT'S OKAY, I KNOW POLITICS.

56
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,900
I'M

57
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,879
WINNING IN ALL THESE SPECIAL
ELECTIONS.

58
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,879
BUT THOSE HAPPENED

59
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,840
BECAUSE YOU PICKED DEEPLY
CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE TO BE IN

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,950
YOUR CABINET AND THOSE WERE
ELECTIONS TO REPLACE THEM IN

61
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,700
DEEPLY RED DISTRICTS.

62
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,770
BUT THE
KNUCKLEHEAD THINGS I WON, THOSE

63
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,140
GUYS ARE WINNING, I'M AWESOME,
HE BACKS LUTHER STRANGE AND HE

64
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,310
LOSES IN ALABAMA AND HE'S LIKE,
WHAT IS GOING ON?

65
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,310
AND IT'S A

66
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,310
BLOW TO HIS EGO.

67
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,310
NOW HE IS
REELING.

68
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,599
BUT THE REALITY IS OF

69
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,590
COURSE HE MISUNDERSTANDS WHY HE
WON IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THE

70
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,190
PHENOMENON IN THE COUNTRY.

71
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,580
AND
BY THE WAY HE'S NOT ALONE IN

72
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,829
THAT, I THINK MOST OF THE
MAINSTREAM PRESS MISUNDERSTOOD

73
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:03,989
THAT, CERTAINLY THE DEMOCRATIC
AND REPUBLICAN PARTIES

74
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:05,319
MISUNDERSTOOD AS WELL.

75
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,290
THE
COUNTRY IS IN AN ANGRY, POPULIST

76
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:13,150
MOOD, AND THEY HAD ONLY TWO
CHOICES, PERSONALLY PERCEIVED AS

77
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,150
ELITIST AND DEEPLY
ESTABLISHMENT, AND A FAKE

78
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,200
POPULIST, THEY WENT WITH THE
FAKE POPULIST BECAUSE IT WAS

79
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,470
BETTER THAN THE ELITES.

80
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,660
SO WHY
DID LUTHER STRANGE LOSE IN

81
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,660
ALABAMA?

82
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,580
BECAUSE ROY MOORE, WHO
IS A LUNATIC IN ALABAMA, BUT WAS

83
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,270
THE MORE POPULIST CANDIDATE, WON
AGAIN.

84
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,280
POPULISM WINS, NOT CALL

85
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,030
OF PERSONALITY.

86
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,150
BUT APPARENTLY
THAT WAS A HUGE BLOW TO TRUMP'S

87
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,350
EGO AND HENCE WHY HE'S IN A DARK
MOOD AND READY TO LASH OUT.

88
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,350
NOW MORE --

89
00:04:46,350 --> 00:05:08,290
>>THAT'S A DEEP CONSTITUTIONAL
CRISIS POSSIBILITY, BECAUSE THE

90
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,530
PEOPLE THAT ARE CLOSEST TO HIM,
WORKING WITH HIM EVERY DAY,

91
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,460
EVERY HOUR, THEY THINK HE'S
UNSTABLE ENOUGH, AS BOB CORKER

92
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,870
SAID, TO START WORLD WAR III.

93
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,220
SO
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE PRESIDENT

94
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,180
GIVES IN ORDER TO LAUNCH A
NUCLEAR STRIKE THAT MAKES NO

95
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,640
SENSE AT ALL, THAT WOULD KILL
MILLIONS, AND MIGHT CAUSE

96
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,150
RETALIATION THAT WOULD KILL
MILLIONS OF OUR ALLIES AND

97
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,130
PERHAPS OUR CITIZENS?

98
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,370
WHAT DO
THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND THE

99
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,370
CHIEF OF STAFF DO?

100
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,890
THEY FOLLOW
THE ORDER, OR DO THEY STEP IN

101
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,940
AND GO, 25TH AMENDMENT, THE GUY
IS INSANE, WE HAVE TO GET THE

102
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,160
CABINET TOGETHER AND REMOVE HIM
FROM OFFICE.

103
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
THAT'S A REAL

104
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,060
POSSIBILITY AND THEY TALK ABOUT
IT AT THE END, LET ME GET TO

105
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,060
THAT IN A SECOND --

106
00:05:49,060 --> 00:06:07,870
>>NOW, I THINK THEY ARE BEING A
LITTLE TOO KIND TO HIM SAYING

107
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:12,210
THAT HE'S GOTTEN WORSE, I THINK
HE WAS ALWAYS UNSTABLE, I THINK

108
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:18,000
HIS IQ IS UNBELIEVABLY LOW AND
HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT LOW.

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
GO

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,050
BACK TO HIS QUOTES FROM THE
1980S, 90S, 2000S, ETC., HE HAS

111
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,380
ALWAYS BEEN PAINFULLY STUPID.

112
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,720
HOW DO YOU THINK HE TOOK DADDY'S

113
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,210
$200 MILLION AND BANKRUPTED
HIMSELF SIX TIMES?

114
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,210
I DON'T WANT

115
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,650
TO GET INTO ALL THE HISTORY, IF
THEY HAVE TO PRETEND SOMETHING

116
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,720
WENT WRONG RECENTLY, WONDERFUL,
GET HIM OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE

117
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:48,220
RIGHT, HE IS A DANGER TO THE
WORLD, AND CERTAINLY TO US.

118
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,220
AND

119
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:57,811
TRUMP ALSO SENSES THAT HE IS IN
A BAD PLACE, AND APPARENTLY HE

120
00:06:57,811 --> 00:07:02,300
TOLD HIS FORMER CHIEF OF
SECURITY WHEN HE WAS A PRIVATE

121
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,290
CITIZEN, THEN HE BROUGHT THE GUY
OVER FOR A WHILE TO THE WHITE

122
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,290
HOUSE --

123
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,760
>>THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD HIM.

124
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:15,780
NOW,
THE WHITE HOUSE 

125
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,780
OF COURSE DENIES

126
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,780
THAT HE SAID THAT.

127
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,050
WHAT DO YOU
THINK THE GUYS AT THE WHITE

128
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,920
HOUSE ARE GOING TO SAY ABOUT A
QUOTE THAT SAYS I HATE ALL OF

129
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
YOU?

130
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,310
THEY OF COURSE DENIED IT,
BUT THAT IS IN THE VANITY FAIR

131
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,020
PIECE.

132
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,020
AND IT'S BECAUSE WHY?

133
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,670
BECAUSE HE'S A CHILD, AND HE

134
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:37,420
THINK I WANT IT, I WANT TO
DESTROY EVERYTHING OBAMA DID, OH

135
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,690
GOD, WE HAVE TO HAVE A VOTE ON
IT?

136
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,190
WHY DON'T WE KILL KIM

137
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,000
JONG-UN AND GET RID OF NORTH
KOREA, TOTALLY AND UTTERLY

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,610
DESTROY THEM LIKE I'VE SAID ON
TV?

139
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,960
THAT WOULD BE HARD AND IT

140
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,990
WOULD HAVE RAMIFICATIONS, A LOT
OF PEOPLE WOULD DIE AND IT WOULD

141
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:55,960
HURT OUR ALLIES, AND AS HE ONCE
SAID, NORTH KOREA, I DIDN'T KNOW

142
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,600
IT WAS THIS COMPLICATED.

143
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,430
HEALTHCARE, I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS

144
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,770
THAT COMPLICATED.

145
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:08,220
HIS IQ IS
UNBELIEVABLY LOW, DANGEROUSLY

146
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,220
LOW.

147
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,220
OKAY --

148
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:24,500
>>IF YOU NOTICE, THAT'S NOT OUT
OF DUTY TO DONALD TRUMP, IT'S

149
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
OUT OF DUTY TO THE COUNTRY.

150
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,410
HE
IS IN GENERAL AND HE THINKS IF I

151
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,000
LEAVE THIS CHILD COULD BREAK THE
PLANET.

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,809
I CAN'T GO BECAUSE I

153
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:38,239
CAN'T TRUST THIS GUY TO MAKE ANY
INFORMED DECISIONS, ANY RATIONAL

154
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,140
DECISIONS, IF HE DOESN'T HAVE A
BABYSITTER.

155
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,140
THAT'S THE STATE OF

156
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,140
THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW --

157
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:58,640
>>WHAT WOULD BE THOSE MEASURES?

158
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,520
AS I TOLD YOU, THE 25TH

159
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
AMENDMENT.

160
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,270
WE TALK ABOUT THE
25TH AMENDMENT, I HAD A POLL A

161
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,540
WHILE BACK THAT SAID THEY
SHOULDN'T DO WITH THE 25TH

162
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,501
AMENDMENT, IT SETS A BAD
PRECEDENT, IF WE DISAGREE WITH

163
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:16,060
THE PRESIDENT NO MATTER HOW
MUCH, IT SETS GROUNDS FOR

164
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,060
REMOVING HIM.

165
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:22,500
IF THE PRESIDENT
IS NOT INTELLIGENT AND WE

166
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,730
DISAGREE WITH HIM, IT'S NOT A
GOOD ENOUGH REASON, HE HAS TO

167
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,780
ACTUALLY BE MENTALLY UNSTABLE,
UNFIT FOR OFFICE, AND THAT IS A

168
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,700
HEAVY BURDEN.

169
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,280
GIVEN THE NEWS
RECENTLY, I SWITCHED MY VOTE ON

170
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,770
THAT, I THINK THEY SHOULD DO THE
25TH AMEND IT, I THINK HE'S

171
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,400
MENTALLY UNFIT FOR OFFICE.

172
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,550
APPARENTLY I'M NOT ALONE
IN THINKING THAT.

173
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,900
BACK TO VANITY FAIR --

174
00:09:46,900 --> 00:10:12,220
>>THEREBY PROVING OUR POINT
COMPLETELY.

175
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,750
HE'S NEVER READ THE

176
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,750
CONSTITUTION, ARE YOU KIDDING
ME?

177
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,900
HE USES IT AS A PUNCHLINE.

178
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,070
IF YOU ARE OUT THERE AND YOU ARE
A DENTIST AND YOU DON'T KNOW ALL

179
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,640
THE AMENDMENTS, I HEAR YOU,
BROTHER.

180
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB.

181
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
IF

182
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,190
YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT AND
SOMEONE TELLS YOU ABOUT THE 25TH

183
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:30,361
AMENDMENT, AT LEAST HAVE ENOUGH
SENSE TO GO I HEAR YOU, AND THEN

184
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,950
WHEN HE LEAVES YOU GOOGLE IT.

185
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:33,950
DON'T TELL YOUR CHIEF

186
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,920
STRATEGIST, WHAT IS IN THE
CONSTITUTION?

187
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,510
WHAT IS THE 25TH

188
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,510
AMENDMENT?

189
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,510
THAT'S THE ONE WHERE
YOU ARE SO STUPID THEY REMOVE

190
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,970
YOU FROM OFFICE.

191
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:47,370
PART OF IT IS
FUNNY, PART OF IT IS DEADLY

192
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,380
SERIOUS.

193
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:54,680
I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU
THINK, TYTNETWORK.COM/25TH, IT

194
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,610
WAS 70/30 BEFORE, 30% AGREEING
WITH ME BEFORE THAT IT SHOULDN'T

195
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,610
BE USED.

196
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,680
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A
PULL OF OUR VIEWERS, IT'S NOT A

197
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,480
SCIENTIFIC POLL, WE AREN'T
SAYING IT IS, BUT IF YOU ARE NOT

198
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,610
WORRIED, YOU ARE WRONG.

199
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,670
THE
ENTIRE WHITE HOUSE, THE ENTIRE

200
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,731
REPUBLICAN CAUCUS, ACCORDING TO
ONE OF THEIR OWN, BOB CORKER, HE

201
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:23,250
SAID ALMOST THE ENTIRE
REPUBLICAN CAUCUS IS WORRIED.

202
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,550
YOU HAVE A GUY WHO IS MENTALLY
UNFIT FOR OFFICE AS THE

203
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,500
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, AND THE

204
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,670
MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON EARTH.

205
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,720
IF YOU AREN'T WORRIED, YOU

206
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,280
AREN'T PAYING ATTENTION.

207
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,920
THEY
HAVE TO GET HIM OUT, HE'S A

208
00:11:37,920 --> 00:00:00,000
DANGER TO THE WORLD.
