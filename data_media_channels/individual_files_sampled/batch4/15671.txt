teen vogue has continued its trend of indoctrinating teenagers with far-left propaganda this time opting to promote domestic terrorist organization and Tifa it wasn't long ago that teen vogue was promoting anal sex giving teenagers all the information they needed to know how to engage in a sexual act promoted by the porn industry and so you'll forgive me if I miss Teen Vogue's piece encouraging its readers to excuse the violence of domestic terrorist organization and Tifa but luckily they've reminded me in a tweets on the 22nd of June Teen Vogue wrote the primary motivation is to stop racists from organizing sharing an article with the title here's what an Tifa is really trying to do from the onset it is clear that Teen Vogue is attempting to discourage its young readers from listening to not just conservatives but all non far leftist who accurately describe the brutality violence and wicked behavior of an Tifa teen vogue wants to create a generation of political ideologues and activists who excuse violence as long as it's used to help advance their own agenda the peace starts by explaining the history of the Charlottesville rally which ended in tragedy teen vogue uses the story as leverage to begin the discussion with a context that right-wing or conservative equals bad the assumption that the Charlottesville rally represents the wider conservative movement is of course wrong but that doesn't matter and the rest of the article is essentially a puff piece interviewing a historian from Dartmouth College who also happens to be the author of the anti-fascists handbook so an all-around fair and balanced commentator right Teen Vogue asked Mark Bray about the violence and criminal activity that an tyfa engages in and he justifies it by saying they have a view of self-defense that entails both self-defense and an immediate sense and in a pre-emptive sense the immediate sense has been very necessary and really the root of anti-fascism both going back to the 1920s and 30s when anti-fascism grew the need for self defense from Mussolini's black shirts and Hitler's brown shirts but also over the past decades when immigrants groups left us punks and skinheads have found a need in different times and places to defend themselves and fight back they also see self-defense as a pre-emptive measure they refuse to give white supremacist and fascists the benefit of the doubt that they're organizing will not at some point result in attacks on vulnerable communities if necessary if other methods of stopping them do not work than confronting them and forcing them to stop is part of the repertoire and this is precisely why the far-left cannot be reasoned with Marc Bray and others who excuse the behavior of this domestic terrorist organization perpetuate the lie that antiva are fighting real Nazis they are not fighting real Nazis Trump supporters are not Nazis and no matter how many times the Left claim they are that is not going to change when the left believe they are actually at war with Nazis of course they're going to use violence most reasonable people would consider force if they really believed they were about to be ruled by murderous authoritarians and when people like Marc Bray and outlets like Teen Vogue perpetuate this lie they don't just create further division in society but they put innocent people's lives at risk Teen Vogue is putting lives at risk and indoctrinating children and that is inexcusable if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
