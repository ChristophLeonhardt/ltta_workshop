I've also returned to his longtime punching bag Attorney General Jeff Sessions I put an attorney general that never took control of the Justice Department Jeff Sessions never took control of the Justice Department even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself and then you wouldn't have put him in he took the job and then he said I'm going to recuse myself I said what kind of a man is this and by the way he was on the campaign you know the only reason I gave him the job because I felt lousy for more enjoined by Connecticut Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal Peter Baker chief White House correspondent for The New York Times and Zerlina Maxwell who's director of the progressive programming for Sirius XM radio let me start with Peter Baker about the president's mindset right now what is your reporting about he's up at one o'clock in the morning tweeting in capital letters all this stuff it seems to me he odd that for any grown up I mean he's in his seventies he's up it's one o'clock in the morning out there tweeting in capital letters to whom who's he talking to and why at that time of the morning yeah no it's absolutely a curve evokes the memories of Nixon during Watergate talking to the paintings right you know a president sort of caught alone in his house late at night stewing over the troubles that are be sitting you know have beset him wondering what way out you know and it's very evocative and it does suggest somebody who is stewing and in very consumed with the troubles that are you know flicking his people around him and really kind of the walls closing in on him it's it's someday there will be a tell-all book that will give us a little bit of a better picture of last night last night could be the opening scene of the book it sounds very very to you uh you know dramatic while you're on this Peter I want to get your thinking about what his biggest fear is right now because is it sort of a just a sense that everyone around and he had done business with these interesting characters that all of them not unfamiliar with people who are flipping all the time I mean that's an amazing announcement by the president knows all these people that flip to save themselves before federal charges or state charges he knows people like this he does business with people like this someone to get to this the rest this show why does he pick people like Cohen to do business with people like benefit to do business with their flippable because they've all been vulnerable to federal charges that they would be forced to the deals deal with then go after him he ends up being the fall guy yeah absolutely you know if you know he promised he would have only the best people around him and you know so far we've seen what seven I think convictions in guilty pleas so far among people who were pretty important to him Michael Cole was not just sort of a random person plucked off the street not a coffee boy as they dismissed Papadopoulos this is somebody who worked with him for years Paul Manafort was put in charge of his campaign Michael flew is his national security adviser these are really important figures in him now do they you know implicate him the president directly and something Michael Cohen does most arrests don't well we don't know what Robert Muller knows and that's the really interesting thing we heard today that David pecker the head of the American media you know glamour that owns the National Enquirer is now cooperating has an immunity deal with the prosecutors that's part of the you know scheme that have been put in place to kill stories about women who are claiming affairs with the president before the election so the president the prosecutors now have testimony presumably from him about how that worked so the president's you know sitting there up at one o'clock in the morning watching all of these pieces fall in the in the wall that he had surrounded himself with and a one o'clock good morning he's still cursing Jeff Sessions the AG who doesn't play ball with him anyway sessions pushed back today on the president's latest attacks on him among them that he didn't take control the Justice Department sessions wrote I took control the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in which is why we have had an unprecedented success in effectuating the president's agenda why I am Attorney General the action of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations but South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters today he expects Trump will fire sessions after this fall's midterm elections let's watch this the president's entitled to attorney general he has faith in somebody that's qualified for the job clearly Attorney General Sessions doesn't have the competence of the President and all I can say is that I have a lot of respect for the Attorney General but that's that's an important office in the country and there after the election I think there will be some serious discussions about a new attorney job well Lee it seems to me senator Blumenthal did that say you have agreed upon time for a Saturday night massacre in other words we're gonna get rid of this prosecution by getting rid of the Attorney General will then grab charge of it all and that new person whether it's Rudy Giuliani wherever I forced in there is gonna do what I want I'll be free that knocking sound you hear is the Special Counsel at the White House door the White House is looking increasingly like a criminal enterprise and of course the president is flailing and failing and that's why there is this talk about firing the Attorney General which would be a path and prelude to firing the special counsel but equally threatening to fire the Deputy Attorney General who ultimately right now is responsible for this investigation and that john dunn young that no man is know you began with no man is an island ends with the call that the the bell tolls for the ask Not For Whom the Bell Tolls it tolls for the it tolls for my Republican colleagues to stand up and shake themselves out of this moral stupor and abandon the purposeful inertia that is giving the president solace as he goes down this increasingly belligerent and bullying and unhinged path zolina we have two political parties I know you're not formally your associate with the Democratic Party you're not here to spoke for them but we've got two political parties everyone is not talking the Republican Party they're saying nothing in fact Lindsey Graham is basically enabling this president fire the fire of this j.g and get control of the operation the president said I could take control of the prosecution of me he said that just this week what are the Democrats don't there should they be talking impeachment now finally after all this action of this week if you had asked me that a few months back Chris I would have said no that Democrats should hold off on talking about impeachment because we need to see all of the facts and I still think that we need to see all of the facts but I think Tuesday change things fundamentally in this country the president was implicated directly in a criminal conspiracy in court under oath and that is something that has never happened before in this country in terms of a crime that goes to the Eligibility excuse me the legitimacy of his election right it's at the core of his election it's something that made it more possible for him to be elected elected by hiding salacious details about alleged affairs and so I think that Democrats can start talking about impeachment not saying that we should just remove the president without going through the full two-step process right but I think that if now is when we can't talk about impeachment when can we talk about impeachment the president was implicated in a crime and I can't imagine a scenario that is could be any more ripe for a serious discussion by responsible adults that's exactly what the framers would have wanted hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to
