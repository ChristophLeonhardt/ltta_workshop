00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,600
Hundreds of thousands of troops gathered near
the North Korean border as the United States

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,760
and South Korea held their largest ever joint
military exercise in early 2016. The two nations

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,529
hold these drills annually to test their preparedness
against an attack from North Korea. Besides

4
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,630
their shared disapproval for the North, South
Korea and the US don’t seem to have much

5
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,620
in common. So we wanted to know, why do the
US and South Korea love each other?

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,660
Well, South Korea and the US’s diplomatic
relationship stems back to the aftermath of

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,230
World War Two. At the time, the Korean peninsula
had recently split, and the UN refused to

8
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,070
recognize the North as a legitimate state.
In response, North Korea invaded the newly

9
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,750
formed South, and the US came to South Korea’s
defense. In 1954, following three years of

10
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:55,559
war, South Korea and the US created a “relationship
forged in blood”, in which the two countries

11
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,950
agreed to defend each other in the event of
an attack. Their alliance strengthened in

12
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,390
2008, when newly elected President Lee Myung-bak[Lee
- MYUHNG BAHK] toughened South Korea’s stance

13
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,639
toward the North. Myung-bak also had a strong
personal relationship with President Barack

14
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:15,329
Obama, who, in 2009 called South Korea “one
of America’s closest allies and greatest

15
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:16,020
friends”.

16
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,859
Additionally, in 2007 the two countries agreed
to a groundbreaking free trade agreement,

17
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:26,829
reducing taxes on exports and imports. Under
this treaty, bilateral trade is expected to

18
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:31,369
be duty free within the next decade. Thus
far it has increased their trade to over one

19
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:36,679
hundred billion dollars annually, with the
US primarily exporting meat and South Korea

20
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:41,679
selling cars and machinery.Today, the US is
South Korea’s second most important trading

21
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:43,439
partner, after China.

22
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,349
But North Korea’s volatility and potential
danger is the glue that holds these two countries

23
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:53,529
together. North Korea’s relationship with
South Korea has worsened considerably since

24
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:59,099
Myung-bak introduced his “Vision 3000”
plan in 2007, which aimed to funnel money

25
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:04,789
into the North in exchange for their denuclearization.
Pyongyang officials not only rejected this

26
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:09,818
proposal, they became even more aggressive
by firing missiles off their west coast and

27
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:15,200
holding their second nuclear test. Tensions
rose again in 2010, when North Korea allegedly

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,300
fired a torpedo at a South Korean warship,
killing nearly 50 people on board. In response,

29
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,950
the US strengthened its economic sanctions
on Pyongyang, and strengthened their military

30
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,870
partnership with South Korea. After another
alleged nuclear test from the North in January

31
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:37,450
2016, the US sent four thousand troops to
South Korea, reinforcing the nearly 30 thousand

32
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,490
already stationed there. Many of these troops
are stationed at the Demilitarized Zone, or

33
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:47,030
DMZ, which separates North and South Korea.
The US has attempted to create a peaceful

34
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,960
dialogue between North and South Korea not
only because it honors their military alliance,

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,930
but because it addresses the threat of North
Korea’s nuclear program.

36
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,460
Beyond trade and security, the US and South
Korea share mutually positive social relations.

37
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,320
According to the Pew Research Center, 84 percent
of South Koreans have a favorable view of

38
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,940
the US, a higher percentage than almost any
other country. Roughly 65 percent of Americans

39
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,230
feel similarly for South Koreans. These recent
large scale military exercises shows that

40
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:23,650
US and South Korea are as committed as ever
to combatting North Korea’s turbulent behavior.

41
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,930
The no-mans land between North and South Korea
is one of the most heavily militarized borders

42
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,940
in the world. Find out more about the DMZ
