1
00:00:09,498 --> 00:00:10,366
BRIAN: IT WAS RELATIVELY

2
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:11,233
ABRUPT IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY

3
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:12,101
MORNING AND THE PRESIDENT

4
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:13,169
DECIDED AFTER GETTING UP AND

5
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:14,203
SLEEPING ON IT WEDNESDAY

6
00:00:14,203 --> 00:00:15,871
THAT HE WILL NO LONGER BE

7
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:17,706
LOOKING FOR SINGAPORE SUMMIT

8
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:21,277
ON JUNE 12TH.

9
00:00:21,277 --> 00:00:22,378
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM SPOKE

10
00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:23,879
TO THE PRESIDENT, MIGHT BE

11
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,147
SEEING HIM AGAIN.

12
00:00:25,147 --> 00:00:25,881
SENATOR, I WAS SHOCKED TO

13
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:26,582
GET THAT LETTER.

14
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:30,619
I KNEW THINGS WEREN'T ON THE

15
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:31,287
RIGHT TRACK I DIDN'T KNOW

16
00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:32,588
THEY WERE ON THE WRONG

17
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:32,888
TRACK.

18
00:00:32,888 --> 00:00:33,823
WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT.

19
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:35,791
>> ABOUT 24 HOURS AGO.

20
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,759
EVERYBODY WHO IS CRITICIZING

21
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:37,827
THE PRESIDENT REGARDING THE

22
00:00:37,827 --> 00:00:38,861
LETTER, HOW WELL DID YOU DO

23
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:39,595
IN NORTH KOREA?

24
00:00:39,595 --> 00:00:40,930
WE FINALLY GOT A PRESIDENT

25
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,098
WHO HAS THEIR ATTENTION.

26
00:00:42,098 --> 00:00:43,165
THEY ARE PLAYING THE SAME

27
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:44,567
OLD GAME THEY PLAYED FOR 30

28
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:45,835
YEARS AND TRUMP IS NOT GOING

29
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:47,470
TO TOLERATE IT I THINK THE

30
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,838
LETTER WAS THE RIGHT

31
00:00:48,838 --> 00:00:49,205
DECISION.

32
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:50,005
HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO

33
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:51,340
UNDERSTAND ABOUT NORTH KOREA

34
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,408
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP.

35
00:00:52,408 --> 00:00:54,210
HE MADE A DECISION EARLY ON

36
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,978
WITHIN HIS FIRST 30 DAYS

37
00:00:55,978 --> 00:00:57,279
BEING IN OFFICE THAT I'M

38
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:58,714
GOING TO END THE NORTH KOREA

39
00:00:58,714 --> 00:00:59,882
NUCLEAR THREAT TO OUR

40
00:00:59,882 --> 00:01:00,816
COUNTRY AND THE WORLD AT

41
00:01:00,816 --> 00:01:01,117
LARGE.

42
00:01:01,117 --> 00:01:03,319
THE ONLY QUESTION NOW IS HOW

43
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:04,019
AND WHEN.

44
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,754
IT'S NOT IF, IT'S HOW AND

45
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:06,055
WHEN.

46
00:01:06,055 --> 00:01:08,123
HE PREFERS TO DO IT DIPLOMAT

47
00:01:08,123 --> 00:01:08,457
LIKELY.

48
00:01:08,457 --> 00:01:09,925
WE HOPE TO HAVE A WIN, WIN,

49
00:01:09,925 --> 00:01:11,393
WHERE WE SET DOWN WITH NORTH

50
00:01:11,393 --> 00:01:11,694
KOREA.

51
00:01:11,694 --> 00:01:13,262
WE END THE KOREAN WAR.

52
00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:14,863
WE PROVIDE THEM THE SECURITY

53
00:01:14,863 --> 00:01:16,031
AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY THEY

54
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:17,399
NEED AND WANT AND THEY GIVE

55
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:19,501
UP THEIR NUKES.

56
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:20,202
BRIAN: THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND

57
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:20,836
SOMETHING YOU JUST SAID,

58
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:22,871
THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL END

59
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:25,474
THIS PROBLEM IN HIS FIRST

60
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:25,774
TERM.

61
00:01:25,774 --> 00:01:28,010
>> IN MY BELIEF HE WILL.

62
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,445
IT'S NOT IF HE ENDS THE

63
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:30,212
NORTH KOREAN PROGRAM.

64
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:31,013
IT'S HOW AND.

65
00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:33,616
WHEN THERE'S TWO WAYS.

66
00:01:33,616 --> 00:01:35,584
DIPLOMACY A WIN, WIN, WHICH

67
00:01:35,584 --> 00:01:37,453
IS THE PREFERRED ROUTE,

68
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:38,787
MILITARY CONFLICT THAT WILL

69
00:01:38,787 --> 00:01:40,356
DESTROY THE REGIME.

70
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:40,656
WHEN.

71
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:41,991
I THINK HE IS GOING TO DO

72
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:43,192
THIS IN HIS FIRST TERM.

73
00:01:43,192 --> 00:01:45,227
HE TOLD ME YESTERDAY I'M NOT

74
00:01:45,227 --> 00:01:46,328
GOING TO PASS THIS ON TO

75
00:01:46,328 --> 00:01:46,829
ANYBODY ELSE.

76
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,298
HE THINKS HE IS GOING TO GET

77
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:50,232
REELECTED, SO DO I.

78
00:01:50,232 --> 00:01:51,767
THE ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU

79
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:53,302
THE NORTH KOREANS UNDERSTAND

80
00:01:53,302 --> 00:01:54,903
OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM.

81
00:01:54,903 --> 00:01:56,171
THEY WAIT EVERY PRESIDENT

82
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:56,438
OUT.

83
00:01:56,438 --> 00:01:57,573
THEY ENTER AN AGREEMENT AND

84
00:01:57,573 --> 00:01:58,841
THEY BACK OFF AND THEY RUN

85
00:01:58,841 --> 00:01:59,675
OUT THE CLOCK.

86
00:01:59,675 --> 00:02:00,843
THEY ARE TRYING TO RUN OUT

87
00:02:00,843 --> 00:02:02,111
THE CLOCK ON TRUMP.

88
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:03,245
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO RUN

89
00:02:03,245 --> 00:02:04,146
OUT THE CLOCK.

90
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:05,647
TIME IS NOT ON NORTH KOREA'S

91
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:07,683
SIDE FOR THE FIRST TIME

92
00:02:07,683 --> 00:02:08,317
EVER.

93
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:08,851
BRIAN: WHAT'S NEXT?

94
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:10,219
>> WHAT'S NEXT IS GO BACK TO

95
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:11,487
CHINA WHAT DID YOU DO THAT

96
00:02:11,487 --> 00:02:12,588
MEETING ON THE BEACH

97
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:13,222
UNDERCUT EVERYTHING THERE

98
00:02:13,222 --> 00:02:16,158
WOULD BE NO NUCLEAR NORTH

99
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:16,758
KOREA WITHOUT CHINA.

100
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:18,527
IS HE GOING TO GO BACK TO

101
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:19,928
CHINA AND READ THEM THE RIOT

102
00:02:19,928 --> 00:02:20,195
ACT.

103
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:21,630
IF YOU WANT A PEACEFUL

104
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,764
SOLUTION TO THE NORTH KOREAN

105
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:23,298
PROBLEM, HELP ME.

106
00:02:23,298 --> 00:02:24,299
IF YOU KEEP PLAYING THIS

107
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:26,168
GAME WE HAVE PLAYED FOR 30

108
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:26,468
YEARS.

109
00:02:26,468 --> 00:02:27,236
THERE IS GOING TO BE A WAR

110
00:02:27,236 --> 00:02:28,670
IN YOUR BACKYARD AND NOT

111
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:28,971
OURS.

112
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:29,738
NORTH KOREA IS GOING TO

113
00:02:29,738 --> 00:02:30,038
LOSE.

114
00:02:30,038 --> 00:02:31,039
THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE A

115
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,674
DECISION HE CANNOT TOLERATE

116
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:33,609
A NUCLEAR NORTH KOREA THAT

117
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:35,410
CAN HIT THE HOMELAND WITH A

118
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,945
NUCLEAR TIPPED MISSILE THAT

119
00:02:36,945 --> 00:02:38,213
THEY WILL SELL WHATEVER THEY

120
00:02:38,213 --> 00:02:38,547
BUILD.

121
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:39,748
HE WILL BRING THIS THREAT TO

122
00:02:39,748 --> 00:02:40,315
AN END.

123
00:02:40,315 --> 00:02:42,451
HE WOULD LIKE TO DO IT

124
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:45,554
THROUGH DIPLOMACY, A WIN-WIN

125
00:02:45,554 --> 00:02:47,856
FOR NORTH KOREA, CHINA AT

126
00:02:47,856 --> 00:02:48,490
LARGE.

127
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,658
IT'S NOT IF THE PROGRAM

128
00:02:49,658 --> 00:02:50,592
ENDS, IT'S HOW.

129
00:02:50,592 --> 00:02:51,626
I HOPE THROUGH DIPLOMACY

130
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:52,994
THERE WOULD BE NO NUCLEAR

131
00:02:52,994 --> 00:02:54,663
NORTH KOREA WITHOUT CHINA'S

132
00:02:54,663 --> 00:02:54,963
HELP.

133
00:02:54,963 --> 00:02:55,931
THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE

134
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:57,566
PEACE WITHOUT CHINA'S HELP.

135
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:58,733
IF THERE IS GOING TO BE A

136
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:00,435
WAR, IT'S GOING TO END BADLY

137
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:02,437
FOR NORTH KOREA.

138
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:03,605
BRIAN: DO YOU LOOK FOR

139
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:04,973
SANCTIONS TO BE RAMPED UP

140
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:06,108
AND IF CHINA DOES NOT

141
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:07,309
COOPERATE WHAT DO WE DO?

142
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:09,344
>> IF CHINA AND SOUTH KOREA

143
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:10,245
GOES WOBBLABLY.

144
00:03:10,245 --> 00:03:12,614
IN THE WORLD GOES WOBBLABLY

145
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:13,548
ON THE MAXIMUM PRESSURE

146
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:14,249
CAMPAIGN YOU ARE PUTTING

147
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:15,283
TRUMP IN THE A BOX.

148
00:03:15,283 --> 00:03:16,251
THAT'S THE WORST THING YOU

149
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:17,619
COULD DO RIGHT NOW.

150
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:18,553
MAXIMUM PRESSURE WILL

151
00:03:18,553 --> 00:03:18,920
CONTINUE.

152
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,288
WE WILL TRY TO REENGAGE THE

153
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:20,989
NORTH KOREANS.

154
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:22,124
WE ARE NOT GOING TO BEG

155
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:22,457
THEM.

156
00:03:22,457 --> 00:03:23,525
THIS IS NOT OBAMA.

157
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:25,293
THIS IS NOT JOHN KERRY.

158
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:26,728
THIS IS DONALD TRUMP.

159
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:27,662
BRIAN: HE HAS ALREADY SHOWN

160
00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:28,730
BY PULLING OUT OF THE

161
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,498
IRANIAN DEAL.

162
00:03:29,498 --> 00:00:00,000
PULLING OUT OF THE PARIS
