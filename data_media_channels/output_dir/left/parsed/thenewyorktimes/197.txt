When North Korea
threatened to back out
of the nuclear summit
with President Trump,
they pointed the finger at
one person — John Bolton —
and blasted his calls for
the so-called Libya model.
Not even Bolton’s
boss is happy with it.
“Well, the Libyan model isn’t
a model that we have at all.”
So just what is Bolton’s
so-called Libya model?
It started in 2003,
when Libya decided
to dismantle its fledgling
nuclear weapons program.
The country even shipped parts
to a warehouse in Tennessee.
“These are aluminum
vacuum tubes in which
the centrifuge machinery
themselves operate.”
And according to John Bolton,
it all went down
in one fell swoop.
No half-steps,
no concessions.
His take was that
Muammar Qaddafi simply
made a strategic calculation:
Give up the nukes,
and Libya would no
longer be a global pariah —
and avoid the fate of
Saddam Hussein’s Iraq.
What actually happened with
Libya is a matter of debate,
but it became Bolton’s go-to
model for how to disarm
rogue states like
North Korea.
“Is it a requirement
that Kim Jong-un
agree to give away
those weapons before
you give any kind
of concession?”
“I think that’s right.
I think we’re looking at the
Libya model of 2003, 2004.”
“The implementation
of the decision
means getting rid of
all the nuclear weapons,
dismantling them, taking
them to Oak Ridge, Tenn.”
Why is Bolton’s
Libya model
so offensive
to North Korea?
First, it’s a dig at the regime’s
crowning achievement.
As the official North Korea
statement says,
'It is absolutely
absurd to compare
North Korea, a nuclear
state, to Libya,
which had been at the initial
state of nuclear development.'
It’s true that Libya was
barely a nuclear startup.
And North Korea actually has
warheads, ballistic missiles
and a vast network of labs
and development sites.
Second, North Korea calls
Bolton’s model a “sinister move
to impose on our dignified state
the destiny of Libya or Iraq.”
A few years after Libya’s nukes
were shipped to Tennessee,
U.S.-backed airstrikes helped
overthrow Qaddafi:
a vivid reminder to
Kim Jong-un of what
happens to leaders who
give up their defenses.
So why is Bolton
invoking a reference
that’s clearly
so inflammatory?
There are some who speculate
that Bolton is intentionally
sabotaging the
North Korea talks,
just as he did in 2003,
because he believes
North Korea can’t be trusted.
This is him on Fox News
just a few weeks before
becoming national
security adviser.
“Why in the world
would they agree
to not halt the program,
to give it up completely?
It just doesn’t logically
make any sense.”
“Because they’re lying.
You know, there’s an
all-purpose joke here.
Question: How do
you know
that the North Korean
regime is lying?
Answer: Their lips
are moving.”
According to Bolton,
this is their real goal.
“They want to buy time.
Three months, six months,
12 months, whatever it is
they need to get
across the finish line.”
Bolton says this was part
of his life as a pundit.
Now his job is to help the
president achieve his goals.
Which by all measures
seems to include
cutting a historic deal
with North Korea.
It could be that Bolton
simply believes
the only way to prevent
North Korea from
playing games is to demand
a Libya-style playbook.
But what is clear is
Bolton’s repeated talk
about the Libya model is
antagonizing the North —
and now apparently
the White House.
“The Libyan model
that was mentioned
was a much different deal.
This would be with
Kim Jong-un something
where he’d be there,
he’d be in his country,
he’d be running
his country.”
