1
00:00:00,687 --> 00:00:02,220
SIGN THAT HE COULD POTENTIALLY

2
00:00:02,221 --> 00:00:05,490
BE A SUBJECT OR A TARGET OF THIS

3
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:06,425
INVESTIGATION.

4
00:00:06,426 --> 00:00:06,692
ED?

5
00:00:06,693 --> 00:00:07,959
>> Ed: KRISTIN FISHER, I

6
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,627
APPRECIATE THEIR REPORTING.

7
00:00:08,628 --> 00:00:09,861
AS  AS A REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST R

8
00:00:09,862 --> 00:00:09,895
AS  AS A REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST G

9
00:00:09,896 --> 00:00:10,128
AS  AS A REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST R

10
00:00:10,129 --> 00:00:11,463
STONE NEXT ON THE SPECIAL

11
00:00:11,464 --> 00:00:12,664
COUNSEL WAS?

12
00:00:12,665 --> 00:00:13,598
STONE JOINS US NOW LIVE TO TELL

13
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,900
US WHAT HE KNOWS AND WHAT HE

14
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:16,234
DOESN'T.

15
00:00:16,235 --> 00:00:17,302
GOOD EVENING, MR. STONE.

16
00:00:17,303 --> 00:00:18,704
>> THANK YOU, ED.

17
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:19,838
GREAT TO BE HERE.

18
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,707
>> Ed: WE HEARD THAT CLIP FROM

19
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,544
SHE GOT IN TROUBLE, SO SHE HAS

20
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:26,511
REFORMED HER LIFE, AND YOU'VE

21
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:27,913
HIRED HER TO DO WORK.

22
00:00:27,914 --> 00:00:30,115
SHE IS TRYING TO TURN THINGS

23
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:32,117
AROUND AND SHE BASICALLY SAYS,

24
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:33,118
SOMEHOW, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WHO

25
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,620
IS SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AT

26
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:36,755
ALLEGED RUSSIAN COLLUSION

27
00:00:36,756 --> 00:00:37,856
BROUGHT HER IN FOR QUESTIONING.

28
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:40,258
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?

29
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:42,627
>> THEY STRUCK HER WITH A BILL

30
00:00:45,298 --> 00:00:48,266
TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON.

31
00:00:57,176 --> 00:00:59,244
OR ANYTHING ELSE.

32
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:01,213
NOR DOES ANYBODY ELSE WHO HAS

33
00:01:01,214 --> 00:01:01,880
BEEN PARADED IN FRONT OF THE

34
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:04,850
GRAND JURY.

35
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,789
THERE IS NO SUCH WITNESS WHO CAN

36
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:15,260
I REALLY DO REGARD THOSE AS THE

37
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:16,928
PRESIDENT SAYS, AS A WITCH HUNTS

38
00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:17,862
PRESIDENT SAYS, AS A WITCH HUNT.

39
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:19,364
THAT WAS A GREAT REPORT FROM A

40
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:21,399
REPORTER BUT IT WAS ALL

41
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,170
SPECULATION.

42
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:25,937
YES, I HAD AN INNOCUOUS 24 WORD

43
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:28,873
EXCHANGE WITH HIM ON WIKILEAKS

44
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:38,316
>> Ed: YOU ARE SAYING THERE'D

45
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:41,820
BE NO CRIME TO ANY ALLEGED --

46
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:43,655
ANY TALKING TO GUCCIFER,

47
00:01:43,656 --> 00:01:44,822
WIKILEAKS, WHAT YOU ARE

48
00:01:44,823 --> 00:01:45,423
MAINTAINING TONIGHT.

49
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:49,561
PARTNERS IN A FIRM IN WASHINGTON

50
00:01:49,562 --> 00:01:51,462
MANY YEARS AGO, IT WASN'T

51
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:54,299
RECENT, BUT BOTTOM LINE,

52
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,367
PAUL MANAFORT, DOESN'T APPEAR,

53
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,674
DO WITH A 2016 ELECTION.

54
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,248
A RUNAWAY FEDERAL PROSECUTOR

55
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:12,283
COULD CONJURE UP SOME OFFENSE ON

56
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:14,385
MY PART IN AN EFFORT TO PRESSURE

57
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:16,454
ME TO TESTIFY AGAINST THE

58
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:21,759
AND ARTICULATE CRITIC OF THE

59
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:35,339
OTHER MISDEED HAVING TO DO THE

60
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,107
2016 ELECTION, NO.

61
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:47,418
KRISTIN DAVIS SAID THIS MORNING

62
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:50,521
ON FOX THAT WHEN SHE TRIED TO

63
00:02:50,522 --> 00:02:51,188
EXPLAIN, THEY CUT HER OFF.

64
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:52,657
YOU GIVE AN ANSWER THEY DON'T

65
00:02:52,658 --> 00:02:54,859
LIE, THEY CUT YOU OFF.

66
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,427
NO, I THINK IF THEY BRING A CASE

67
00:02:56,428 --> 00:02:57,995
AGAINST ME, IT WILL BE A

68
00:02:57,996 --> 00:03:00,264
FABRICATED CASE, AND THERE IS NO

69
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:02,500
CIRCUMSTANCES WHATSOEVER, ED, IN

70
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:03,901
WHICH I WILL TESTIFY.

71
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:04,869
>> Ed: REAL QUICK, WE ARE JUST

72
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,872
TALKING ABOUT OMAROSA, SHE WAS

73
00:03:07,873 --> 00:03:09,407
ON MSNBC EARLIER TODAY AND

74
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:09,807
INVOKED YOU.

75
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:11,442
LISTEN TO THIS.

76
00:03:11,443 --> 00:03:14,211
>> I THINK THAT ROGER STONE

77
00:03:18,717 --> 00:03:19,717
SHADY CHARACTERS IN TRUMP WORLD

78
00:03:19,718 --> 00:03:21,452
FOR A VERY LONG TIME, AND I

79
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:22,920
THINK THAT THEY HAVE THEIR SITE

80
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:28,192
SHADY CHARACTER.

81
00:03:28,193 --> 00:03:30,227
DOES OMAROSA KNOW SOMETHING

82
00:03:30,228 --> 00:03:32,196
ABOUT YOU THAT WE DON'T AND YOU

83
00:03:32,197 --> 00:03:32,797
KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE

84
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:34,398
PRESIDENT THAT YOU MIGHT TELL

85
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:34,865
ROBERT MUELLER?

86
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:36,334
>> A, LOOK IN THE MIRROR,

87
00:03:36,335 --> 00:03:36,667
OMAROSA.

88
00:03:36,668 --> 00:03:38,169
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO CONVINCED

89
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,237
THE PRESIDENT TO SEND A

90
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:41,706
DELEGATION TO HAITI FOR THE

91
00:03:41,707 --> 00:03:43,441
INAUGURATION OF THE CORRUPT

92
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:48,846
NOW WITH DIFFERENT FRONT FUN.

93
00:03:48,847 --> 00:03:50,448
YOU THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT WAS

94
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:51,148
GREAT UNTIL YOU GOT FIRED AND

95
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:54,652
NOW YOU SAY HE IS A RACIST.

96
00:03:56,855 --> 00:03:57,855
NEGATIVE TOWARD THE PRESIDENT.

97
00:03:57,856 --> 00:04:00,324
AND I AM NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY

98
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:02,660
UP IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF A

99
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:03,894
TIGHT SPOT, SOME FALSE

100
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:05,663
ALLEGATION IS BROUGHT AGAINST

101
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:05,930
HIM.

102
00:04:05,931 --> 00:04:06,463
>> Ed: 15 SECONDS.

103
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:08,232
WHAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE HERE?

104
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:09,266
IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT

105
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:09,934
PAUL MANAFORT, WHO HAS BEEN

106
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:11,635
SQUEEZED FOR A MONTH ON MONTH,

107
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:13,270
FACING A LONG TIME POTENTIALLY

108
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:15,639
IN JAIL, OR YOU, HAVE

109
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,674
ANYTHING ON THE PRESIDENT.

110
00:04:18,877 --> 00:04:21,545
>> I THINK BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN A

111
00:04:21,546 --> 00:04:22,646
VERY EFFECTIVE ADVOCATE ON

112
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:24,381
BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE

113
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:29,119
I'M THE CONSERVATIVES AND

114
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,687
LIBERALS LOVE TO HATE.

115
00:04:29,688 --> 00:00:00,000
ED, THERE IS NO RUSSIAN
