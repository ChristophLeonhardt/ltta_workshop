so you've heard presumably about the latest doomsday prophecy of environmentalists they have found a new villain to fight a new cancer to treat and that is straws plastic straws plastic straws are destroying mankind and we have to get rid of them San Francisco is the most recent city I believe to ban straws they will now be straw free they are ace they are a a safe haven from the tyranny of straws so you don't have to worry if you're in if you're in San Francisco you don't have to worry about walking down the street and tripping over a straw and becoming paralyzed which is you know that's that's happened to at least three or four people that I know it's very common now you if you're in San Francisco you still have to worry about walking on the street and stepping on a used heroin needle or slipping in a puddle of human feces but at least you don't have to worry about stalls other cities are also banning straws Seattle's banned straws Santa Barbara is coming down very hard and what they're saying is that if you are if you're caught being a straw dealer you could get six months in jail per straw that you hand out so if you're if you are a waitress and at Denny's and you make the mistake of handing out a straw to one person you get six months now if there's a say a birthday party at Denny's which is a great location for a birthday party then and you hand out straws to everybody you go rogue and you just start handing out straws left and right you could be looking at twenty or thirty years in prison when all is said and done I mean you could if rather than handing out straws if you had just if it was like a toddler birthday party and you had just poured shots of absinthe for all the toddlers you would get less prison time than if you were to hand out straws to them now if you gave them straws to drink the absinthe then I think you've really got a problem that would actually be execution I believe it's that's the rule celebrities have gotten in on the act as well they're they're recording PSAs they're starting campaigns raising awareness about straws so now everybody is aware of straws and it is just it is turned in it into hysteria as per usual we have a crisis because everything has to be a crisis so we can't just have a problem or we can't just discuss an issue it has to be a crisis it has to be oh my gosh we're all gonna die that's what it has to be so that's what it's become with straws now you may have heard that these anti straw measures are necessary because our straw consumption habits are so out of control we become straw addicts and the only way to stop our straw obsession is to just go cold turkey according to the figures that you hear in the media Americans use 500 million straws a day per person not only it's perfect wait I think it's collectively okay so collectively Americans use 500 million straws a day that's more than 3 billion a week that means if you connected all the straws that we use in a year and you connected them just and you line them all up they would stretch 4 light years into space and actually touch our neighboring star and then be burned up and then you would have this this this towering inferno of straws that would fall down to the earth and engulf us all and engulf the earth in flames ok that's that's how many straws we we use if the statistics that I just cited sound made-up it's because they are the bit about putting them connecting them into space I made that up although who knows maybe that would be true the 500 million bit was made up by a nine-year-old child and his made-up statistic is actually being used by the media and by journalists and by politicians who are passing laws politicians passing laws are citing this statistic that was invented by a fourth grader a nine year old this is how he did it okay nine year old child I think back in 2011 I was concerned about straws which I mean it's great he's environmentally conscious conscious and I know this is not a criticism of the nine-year-old job but he is nine year old nine years old so what he did was he he got on the phone and he conducted an informal phone survey with a few straw manufacturers and based on his conversation with them he guessed that we probably use 500 million straws a day and now that guess by a nine-year-old six years ago is being cited as fact not even like reportedly we use 500 million straws a day or allegedly we use strike or it's estimated that maybe perhaps we use 500 million a day know if you read media reports it's we use 500 million straws a day is it true I mean do we actually use 500 million straws a day I have no idea probably not seems a little high but nobody's bothered to check it everybody's just running with it I don't know how to check that statistic just because you don't know how to check it doesn't mean you could just use it if you can't confirm it at all if it can't be confirmed then that means you just can't use it but this is how it goes you see once a stat even a made-up statistic with no evidence to support it once it becomes attached to a movement it is now carved in stone and and you're not allowed to question it once once the movement adopts it you're not allowed to question anymore so for another example think of the statistic that claims that 20% of all women in college are raped you've heard you've heard that statistic before 20% are rape 20% I mean that is an incredible statistic if it were actually true you think about 20 so you're telling me if I send my daughter to college there's a 20% chance of this happening why would anyone ever send their daughter to college again in that case I mean I would any woman ever go to college again if there's a 20% chance of being raped I mean it's it's horrific it's also invented that's an invented statistic it is is not grounded in reality there there is no factual basis for it at all it is just invented but feminists use it knowing that it's false most of them at least the ones that are leading the movement they know that this statistic is total BS they use it anyway because they figure that their aims are noble and so it doesn't really matter if they lie along the way so same for same for environmentalists environmentalists are notorious for doing this environmentalists and feminists I would say together those two movements are the most inclined to just use fabricated lies to advance their cause because they think that their their aim is just so noble and so good that that they it gives them a pass an ethical kind of hallway pass to use whatever measures they they think are necessary here's the problem though with using made-up statistics first of all they're not true so you're lying if that doesn't bother you then how about this you're hurting your own case when you use made-up statistics because because here's what happens you come in with this crazy statistic and first of all you've given people a reason to discount not just that this statistic but your entire case and then if somebody corrects the stat and the real number is lower than what you said but still pretty bad the only thing people will focus on is the fact that you were wrong so for instance if you if you go if you're very concerned about drunk driving let's say and it's it is something we should be concerned about so you go and you say a thousand people die every day from drunk driving in America at first you're gonna think that you're ridiculously inflated and dishonest statistic is working because a lot of people will hear that and say oh my gosh a thousand people real that I mean that's really that's so high i we have to do something a thousand people most people when they hear a statistic if it is if it is cited authoritative lis especially in a news article they'll just take it at face value they won't question that's how that's how most people react so it is at first you're gonna find that using native statistics is a very effective measure because most people are just just don't think about that they don't think about much at all really and solve you tell them something they'll go oh okay well alright then that must be true because somebody said it to me but invariably some jerk who cares about pesky little things like truth will come along and say well no actually about it's not a thousand people die a days about it's about thirty a day who died and then people everybody else the unthinking masses who had one thousand a day in mind they're gonna hear that they're gonna go oh well that's not so bad at all in comparison I guess drunk driving isn't the problem it's not a problem at all I mean I you I thought we just went from a thousand down to thirty well it's like nothing so you had you had this thing that that is certainly a problem and now people won't see it as a problem anymore because of the way that you chose to approach it if you had just been reasonable and honest and told the truth maybe you could have made a difference but instead you ruined your whole campaign by basing it on nonsense so environmentalists really need to get this through their heads yes it is a worthy goal to try to reduce our use of plastic and yeah straws are kind of wasteful and and I don't think that we use five hundred million a day but we probably use a lot I mean maybe we use a hundred million maybe we use two hundred million I really don't think it's five hundred million because that would require every man woman child and infant on average to use almost two straws a day every day seven days a week 365 days a year and I just and considering they're now me I rarely ever use straws I think I use a straw maybe once a month I'm on like a once a month straw habit and that's the case for pretty much every one of my family we don't have we don't use there's not a lot of straw usage going on in my family and I think there are a lot of people like me who just don't use straws at all so it actually would require considering they're people who don't use straws at all that means that there must be people out there using like ten or fifteen straws a day and considering the fact that hardly anyone uses a straw unless they're eating out like you're going to a fast-food restaurant you're going to you're going to a sit-down restaurant that's for most people it's the only time straws ever come up so that would require there to be a lot of people who are eating out like four or five times a day and getting straws maybe there are some people who do that I don't think it's enough to get you up to 500 million so whatever that whatever the statistic is let's say it's a hundred million two hundred million I don't know what it is even if it's fifty million it's still a lot it's still a lot so just drop the hysterics drop the theatrics drop the propaganda drop the lies stop trying to force the issue through laws and regulations and just instead make your point and encourage people to moderate themselves a little bit that's all you could just say look you know it's theirs look at there's 300 plus million people in America we do eat out we tend to eat out a lot get a lot of fast food so that means that there's a lot of straws being used it's maybe not five hundred million a day but it's still a lot it's kind of a wasteful thing so maybe we should let's just moderate and maybe if you go to UM if you go to some McDonald's and you get a soda unless you really need the straw maybe tell them you know I don't need the straw like you could just encourage people to take measures like that and it's fine and and so people are moderating a little bit it's not hysteria it's just kind of a reasonable thing but when everything has to be a crisis when everything is leading to the annihilation of life on Earth and when you start using these overly emotional appeals and saying somebody said to me on Twitter yesterday they said they said they said well aren't aren't you concerned about your straw ending up law lodged in the nose of a sea turtle aren't you concerned about that and I had to say no not really I mean I have to be honest that is that does not make my well if I'm going to list the top 100 things in life that I'm worried about I don't think the nasal passages of sea turtles really makes the list at all and also I think the chances of the straw that I'm you know using to drink my soda with the chances of that ending up in the nose of a sea turtle the chances are vanishingly small even if I were to take the straw and go to the ocean myself and chuck it into the ocean and say take that sea turtles even if I did that there's almost no chance that that particular straw ends up lodged in the nose of a sea turtle so drop all that stuff and just be honest of course if you were honest you'd have to admit that plastic straws while it while there maybe it's a worthy thing to try to you know just through our own efforts to moderate a little bit still what it comes down to a plastic straws really aren't that big of a deal in the grand scheme here here are some facts for you okay here's some actual statistics if we're going to talk about plastic waste ending up in the ocean which this straw conversation all seems to be centered around that this idea that all the the fight that's supposed to 500 million straws today that we use it's all ending up in the ocean and it's creating this huge raft of straws that is just floating through the Pacific and will eventually crash into Asia and then maybe move the continent of Asia shifted over which will shift that and then all the continents will come together again and which actually maybe wouldn't be such a bad thing maybe we could have cute well it will finally be all one world isn't that what the Liberals want so rather than painting scenarios like that if you were to actually face the facts and be honest about it you would have to admit that 95 percent 95 percent of the plastic in the ocean comes from ten rivers in Asia and Africa so we could stop using plastic altogether it would it would make little difference 60% of all the plastic waste in the ocean comes from China Thailand Vietnam Indonesia and the Philippines so so again plastic from the United States is hardly a problem at all comparatively in terms of percentages it's it's it's hardly a problem think about it 95% 95% of the plastic in the ocean comes from Asia in Africa that leaves 5% of plastic to be split between the entire continent of Europe North America South America and Australia that means we all have 5% of plastic to split and and so if you're to divvy it down how much of that belongs to the United States I don't know but it's what it's significantly less than 5% and then of our small percent let's say it's even I don't know 1% although it's probably less than that let's say it's 1% how much of that small percentage is below is is is due to straws so it's just such a tiny tiny percent that the United States in fact the entire Western world could stop using plastic all together and it would make almost no difference to the ocean because at least 95% of the plastic would still be there that's the reality does that mean that we should make no effort at all it's a kerb our plastic consumption no not saying that sure we should make you know yeah it's it like I said it's a worthy goal I guess it's it's even if we're not worried about it ending up in the ocean it's just a matter of general wastefulness you know there's no reason to use things you don't need and and there's no reason a lot of times if you're at a fast-food restaurant maybe they'll give you a straw you don't even use it so it just adds like six equation so yeah we could we could moderate a bit and and that's it and that's all you have to say forget the laws forget the campaign's the PSAs forget the lies and the made-up statistics in this area just be just be honest a little bit tell people the truth and then we can respond reasonably and everything will be fine and we'll and we'll just live our lives that's all that's my that's my proposal thanks for watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed
