ABC has cancelled Roseanne Barr show Roseanne following a series of unhinged tweets that she shared with the world today but this is nothing new she has a history of unhinged tweets where she attacks people in a questionable way and also shares conspiracy theories but let's talk about what got her fired today so apparently she was responding to a thread having to do with the Obama administration and the CIA under the Obama administration and in that thread someone had mentioned Valerie Jarrett who was one of Obama's longest-serving advisors and here's what Roseanne Barr had to say about Valerie Jarrett Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes had a baby equals VJ meaning Valerie Jarrett so when I first seen that tweet this is a little bit of inside baseball I thought I thought she was talking about Van Jones cuz I'm like where's a where'd that come from and what's Vijay right so my banjo it could've been anyone because Valerie Jarrett was not mentioning the article so it's kind of out of thin blue air right exactly exactly so just to give you more context in regard to what sparked that random tweet she had brought up Jarrett in response to an unrelated Twitter comment on an article which asserted that the Obama CIA had spied on the president of France jarett's name is unmentioned in that piece in that article that was shared okay so I didn't know this but apparently during the Obama administration there were all sorts of crazy conspiracy theories about Valerie Jarrett during the Obama administration's rumors swirled on right wing blogs that she secretly intended to promote Islam in the United States and that she once expressed her desire to make America a more Islamic country so I was curious where those rumors started and apparently it was a tabloid paper in the UK and then all of these right wing blogs would cite that tabloid paper as the source but no one ever really questioned whether that source was legitimate in the first place yeah of course Breitbart did and Infowars did that that's why when the right-wing media is taken seriously I find it hilarious who looks at that family chair it's not Muslim who thinks like Vali Jared decided randomly that she wanted to make America more Islamic I'm not gonna check on that I'm just gonna print it that that makes sense that's that's just very logical and by the way you right-wingers even if you thought those are the same things when do we get our apology because it turns out you were wrong did not make the country more Islamic but it's not like their look they won't apologize because they don't play the same way we play they're not looking to play fair they're looking to smear they're looking to defame they're looking to spread their propaganda and they're very effective at it and I don't know what we're supposed to do in response to that because I don't want to stoop to their disgusting level but at the same time how do you continuously have this logical discussion about politics and policy when the other side is spreading crazy you know malicious rumors like this yeah well part of it that's why I get frustrated at the so-called mainstream media because they just call everything 50/50 and so like no don't get me wrong like so Rosanna Dez pizza a conspiracy theories and she just did one again she thinks that the Parkland survivors are all crisis actors it's so look that makes you mean it does call that out there they don't call that 50/50 right but then they'll go back to considering Breitbart legitimate they'll consider a lot of these daily caller daily why are these concerted publications that are proven over and over again not to state the truth to purposely put propaganda out etc well I don't know maybe they're telling the truth I mean they'll quote insane all right guys they'll use them as sources right and and then go no no I can't discriminate no you can if it's based on logic not discriminate based on race or ethnicity or any non rational factor but if someone has shown over and over again but they're not attached to reality or the truth then you should be a little bit skeptical when they come to you with a scoop or a story etc so I they're gonna do what they're gonna do but the rest of the media should not enable them that's right don't treat them as if they're you know rational actors who are legitimate part of a debate now let's talk about the fallout because there was a lot of fallout prior to the Roseanne show getting canceled so first off Roseanne Barr got a lot of criticism and backlash on Twitter which led to her apology she said I apologize I'm now leaving Twitter she also had tweeted I apologized to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans I'm truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks I should have known better forgive me my joke was in bad taste hey can't I just say look I'm gonna give her a very slight defense of her in a second but I I don't believe that apology for one second that was hey Roseanne you're about to lose your show and millions upon millions of us oh yeah Jared who I've been spreading insane rumors about sorry sorry yes oh my bad I didn't mean it I didn't know it was gonna cost me money when I was just smearing you I enjoyed that when it turns out it's gonna cost me something I did not enjoy that I am now leaving Twitter you're and you're absolutely right about that jank because just a few hours prior to her attacking Valerie Jarrett she was attacking Chelsea Clinton so I'll give you an example of that one of her tweets at Chelsea Soros Clinton again another crazy right-wing conspiracy theory involving George Soros because he's in their mind evil doer that every liberal is connected to they think George Soros funds our show which would be lovely I mean we are always open and willing to take that money if he wants to but he has no and they'll take bad we were kidding around right and then they'll take that the book they're asking for Soros for money are there could you believe what they're doing okay cry me a river and then she also said the following so there was a little bit of backlash to the the Chelsea Clinton tweet and she said this in response to that backlash sorry to have tweeted incorrect info about you please forgive me by the way George Soros is a Nazi who turned in his fellow Jews to be murdered in German concentration camps and stole their wealth were you aware of that but we all make mistakes right Chelsea again another right-wing conspiracy theory she's not really apologetic there so couple things about that one so number one so Roseanne Barr has like literally lost her mind that's my defense where I'll get to that in a second but about that tweet first of all she says Chelsea Clinton sorry I made a mistake you're not actually married to a Soros but haha we all make mistakes like Soros made the mistake of supporting Nazis oh why are you still going after Chelsea Clinton acknowledged she has nothing to do with sorrows okay Sanibel sores didn't do anything you didn't do that and it's a terribly anti-semitic attack a source who's Jewish and suffered through the Holocaust okay I can't imagine anything worse but Roseanne Barr has been as close to everybody Nazis she had attack people going to Israel calling it an apartheid state which other people do right but then call Jewish people Nazis now Roseanne Barr grew up Jewish and then she turned around a dramatic turn around and now calls Palestinians and anyone supporting them Nazis right right what in your mind right in 2012 she ran for president of the United States as a third party candidate she identified as the candidate for the Green Party she went on our show which at that time was on Current TV and I remember her coming in and she presented herself as someone who was so radically leftist that you know the the Democrats are not liberal enough we need someone who's even more you know progressive I'm the Green Party candidate vote for me it's just the yo-yoing that's going on with her political identity is terrifying and fascinating at the same time no so that gives us two more points so she I I dunno why this was the camel that broke two straws that's hilarious slip out this straw that broke the camel's back it's because she actually thanks someone powerful now look to be fair she's done that a little bit in the past to okay but and maybe people just had enough or maybe Bob Iger really really likes Valerie's yard and she's even more proud the rest and she is okay and rally Jared and I I got no love for her and and I don't agree with a lot of what she's done I perceived a snub from her once which was amusing I told it in a postgame anyway not a big deal but but when why didn't Roseanne's show get canceled for calling Palestinians Nazis or did you know that when she was the extreme left she had done some insane thing I don't know if this is extreme left or right I can't even tell anymore she had dressed up as Hitler and baked cookies of people going into ovens and burning oh my god Jesus if that doesn't get your show cancelled like why is this the thing that and it's not the first time she's made racist comments about people know Obama administration Susan Rice she says Susan Rice is a man with big swinging ape testicles you can say balls she said balls April balls okay what is this picture was Susan Rice perfectly pleasant person who worked in the Obama administration and you could agree disagree but what in God's green earth are you're talking about you can agree or disagree with her policies but why is her wasn't seeing this crazy stuff which leads me to my point which is she is she's she's mentally unbalanced like almost clearly so and in fact so I went and did a little bit of research on important fact-checking organizations like Wikipedia and actually do a lot of facts now first I read articles about how some people think that she took too much drugs some people say she had to go to a mental facility but according to Wikipedia she was in a car accident at the age of 16 and then her personality changed dramatically after that and she did to have to spend eight months in a mental institution okay now that made me kind of feel bad for her by the way the but that's when she was 16 so she's been like this ever since and she got her success even though she was in this mental state etc and so when you look at it through that lens know she's clearly unbalanced what is this left-right trumps awesome Israel's terrible and israel's awesome and everybody is not like this none of it makes any sense so okay so that's Roseanne and she's attacked me with great vitriol online right uh even that though I didn't interview with her I just in none of it makes any sense and I'm oh that's totally fine it's she's unbalanced they're people that are on balance in the world but what's amazing is the people who followed her and were like yes we see that's see that's a trump supporter that's a real American and in fact that insane Soros tweet that we just read you Donald Trump jr. retweeted it so on the other hand is his dad really that mentally balanced I think that we're gonna find out that a lot of the right-wing has literally been following crazy people whether it's Roseanne Barr or Alex Jones or Glenn Beck they have they I think they all literally have mental issues significant mental issues let alone Donald Trump two easy ways to follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell
