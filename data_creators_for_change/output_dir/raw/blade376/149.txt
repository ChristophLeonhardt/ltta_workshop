00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
hi everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is myles diet and</font>

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,700
you're listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to podcast 376 as i</font>

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned a few episodes ago i would be</font>

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,590
on tour with fear factory around the UK

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,900
and joining with me today<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my good</font>

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,540
friend and once hero<font color="#CCCCCC"> burton seatbelt oh</font>

7
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:20,580
I like the fact that you're a friend so

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,529
that's awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course and this was</font>

9
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,449
saying we were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about but the</font>

10
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:25,560
reason that I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd have this</font>

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,599
conversation was because I mean to begin

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,689
with before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we became good friends I did</font>

13
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,700
see as a hero son who inspired me much

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,860
and because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's saying I've been</font>

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,000
discussing with lots of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,350
inspiration that I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be</font>

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,850
good to hear your views on things

18
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,940
because I think you've been aware of

19
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,640
having huge influence on people for like

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">what is it 20 years you've been playing</font>

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,510
now something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're 20</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

22
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe an influence for 15 right and what</font>

23
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,760
and I guess my first question therefore

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,399
is when did you first start realizing

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,559
that it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> people weren't just</font>

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,390
enjoying<font color="#E5E5E5"> your music but perhaps people</font>

27
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,649
were taking something a bit more

28
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,549
seriously I remember the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first time a</font>

29
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,320
fellow came up to me was in dallas texas

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,890
it was on the d manufacture tour I can't

31
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember who are on tour with it was in</font>

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,010
Dallas we're in deep ellum somewhere was

33
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,080
summertime maybe it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> megadeth or</font>

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,470
something and<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh this kid comes up to me</font>

35
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,920
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy and he approached me and he's</font>

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,820
like man he really harp was like talking

37
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me so heartfelt it was there's so</font>

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,470
much like passion his voice thing about

39
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,890
song replica<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how much he identified</font>

40
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,320
with that song because that was his life

41
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in Falaise that don't know about</font>

42
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,210
replica that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the premise is about uh</font>

43
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,399
basically being conceived through rape

44
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,259
and does that make you does that action

45
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,960
of hate make you turn you into something

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,119
else or will you be hateful your whole

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,680
life would be you are you're going to

48
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,869
follow a replica<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what your life is or</font>

49
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,329
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow replica of what</font>

50
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:06,630
you know social or genetic social

51
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,150
genetic structure so along<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point but</font>

52
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,470
that's when I first realized like<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

53
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:13,819
people

54
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:16,400
reading my lyrics and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">really it really became poignant to me</font>

56
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,489
but I was always kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> person from the</font>

57
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:25,389
very beginning I was like I knew I

58
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:28,359
didn't want to write just about stupid

59
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:31,159
nothingness you know just one if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

60
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to have this moment in time and</font>

61
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,909
people are going to read my lyrics I'm

62
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:37,000
just seeing something or say something I

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,530
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mean something I wanted to use</font>

64
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,819
this time on earth to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most used that</font>

65
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:45,859
advantage while I could and so ever

66
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:46,879
since the very beginning of Fear Factor

67
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,280
I've always wanted this you know be very

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,599
sure of my words and did when you

69
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,419
identified and had that reaction I mean

70
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:59,719
the issue of responsibility did they

71
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">ever come to a new level in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

72
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,239
that you felt more responsible because

73
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,370
no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> never felt responsible because I</font>

74
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">never felt I was responsible for other</font>

75
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,760
people's actions what I feel responsible

76
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">for other people's emotions yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um the</font>

77
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:18,919
only place I felt responsible was that I

78
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:21,409
needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to whatever I was going to say I</font>

79
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,099
had to believe in it and with pure

80
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:27,530
conviction yeah and I had to say it's

81
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,709
distinctly and directly yep and know

82
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:32,060
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about and</font>

83
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,180
seeing passionately I'm never was you

84
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,430
know I purposely never wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to curse</font>

85
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,530
on songs there's a guess there's a

86
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,930
couple of songs i do say a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

87
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,169
swear words yeah but it's more for an

88
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:47,659
effect an emphasis emphasis<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect an</font>

89
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:50,479
emphasis but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I never felt a</font>

90
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,109
responsibility because I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

91
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you know I've I grew up thinking</font>

92
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,040
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are just lyrics you know</font>

93
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,389
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're saying and it's like</font>

94
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:01,639
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what this person is this is what</font>

95
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,159
this person feels like but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> never felt</font>

96
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,349
that I was responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an other</font>

97
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:10,009
other person's actions right yeah I mean

98
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:11,780
in my own experience recently when it

99
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,509
comes to giving advice and that and the

100
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:17,509
issue I've had is people once they

101
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:19,339
connect with you they rely more on you

102
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,289
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's about keeping that</font>

103
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:23,360
safe distance I guess so for example I

104
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,820
get people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who I'm sure you get it as</font>

105
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,260
well where they give you letters with

106
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:27,570
their

107
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,700
stories<font color="#CCCCCC"> and troubles and you know from</font>

108
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the moment you read that email I mean</font>

109
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">just because my videos are actually</font>

110
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,750
about giving advice and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel like</font>

111
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,460
responsible but actually you've got to

112
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,470
take a deep breath and be realistic

113
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,590
about it and you cannot you cannot get

114
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,020
personal about it yeah and you like your

115
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,110
music and like my videos it is for the

116
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,150
masses and therefore it's always going

117
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,700
to be a tool to inspire but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

118
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,280
call to say to people I'm willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

119
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">help with you on individual basis is</font>

120
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,670
yeah I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be a therapist but</font>

121
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,760
yeah that's yeah I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a much</font>

122
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,100
my wife a minute I was quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> long winded</font>

123
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,270
as always but yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not your</font>

124
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,100
therapist I but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you know if my</font>

125
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,670
if my words and our music can help you

126
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,190
through a hard time that's cool you know

127
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that that's a bonus anyway that's a</font>

128
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,820
bonus and for me you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's lots</font>

129
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">of artists out there and bands that I</font>

130
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,540
listened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that helped me through hard</font>

131
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,100
times as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well but I don't make them</font>

132
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,710
responsible to make me feel better

133
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,300
because it was you it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be your</font>

134
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,830
choice to make him responsible no

135
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,360
there's any way you can make yourself

136
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,540
feel better not no one else yeah that's

137
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,430
good that's that was a topical podcast

138
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,380
not too long ago actually about making

139
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,600
yourself and I guess it is your choices

140
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,540
that's interesting they've been some

141
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,700
questions actually sent to me on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

142
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,930
and that so I'm just going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

143
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,780
some of them now one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the questions</font>

144
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,270
was from tasia who asked and<font color="#CCCCCC"> canuel hero</font>

145
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,450
inspire you too much I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way I</font>

146
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,120
tackle this is it can you be inspired to

147
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,470
much because it's the responsibility

148
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,900
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talked about there but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

149
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,520
hero you can only be honest about what

150
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,960
they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but at the ends a day is</font>

151
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,790
well there's how those two different

152
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,470
aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hero</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mine and we know they're</font>

153
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,260
this person's hero first of all yeah but

154
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,540
is it impossible is it possibly inspired

155
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,520
too much I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I don't think</font>

156
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,380
there's I don't think there's any such

157
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,060
thing as being inspired to my night

171
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,850

172
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,000
yeah so is going beyond yeah what is

173
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,730
literature there yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay ah let's have</font>

174
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,920
a look Lucy says how important do you

175
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,780
think it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> or how much pressure is</font>

176
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,990
there to educate fans of the things you

177
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe in so i guess it goes back to</font>

178
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue of responsibility like how</font>

179
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,500
important is it like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess when</font>

180
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,590
you're right in lyrics if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had like a</font>

181
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,750
pie chart of you know percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ya</font>

182
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that we could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do whatever like you</font>

183
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,310
know percentage of entertainment value

184
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,440
like what is the mentality behind it

185
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,010
it's a fair question you know other

186
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,410
people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> different and people put more</font>

187
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,880
pressure on themselves and others but

188
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,830
for me like i<font color="#E5E5E5"> said before you know the</font>

189
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,110
responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> i feels to myself</font>

190
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,700
responsibility is that I what I'm going

191
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,400
to say needs to be said accurately and

192
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,850
with conviction<font color="#CCCCCC"> and passionately and I</font>

193
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,380
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe in exactly what I'm</font>

194
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know because fans can</font>

195
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,900
tell if it's faked or fridge true but

196
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,250
that's the only you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't feel</font>

197
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,440
pressure from fans or from an audience

198
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know that I'm not that kind of</font>

199
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,430
person I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that type of you know I</font>

200
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,090
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that a type of egocentric</font>

201
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,460
ideal where you know I'm thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

202
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,230
know what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking everyone else has</font>

203
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,030
to think the same thing yes you know

204
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,950
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my opinion and I'm just one man</font>

205
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,290
and it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provoke it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

206
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,300
you know you know provoke a thought yeah

207
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,610
and that's all that's that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> my goal</font>

208
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,680
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like if you're going to</font>

209
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,150
listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the words and you're going to</font>

210
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,460
read the lyrics you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the ones</font>

211
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,140
and maybe you'll think about what I'm

212
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,729
saying maybe it'll take you somewhere

213
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:41,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">else yes ah that's cool Louis asks is it</font>

214
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,469
better to aspire and follow a hero

215
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,750
rather than to expand and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do</font>

216
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,860
good yourself I read that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's a</font>

217
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,010
two-parter obviously yeah yeah

218
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,380
I had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it again is it better</font>

219
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,510
to aspire and follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hero rather than</font>

220
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,430
expand and trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> dig so I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

221
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">how much you rely well you know if if</font>

222
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in your life or someone</font>

223
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:09,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you admire that inspires you that</font>

224
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,620
is a great spark that is a great start

225
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,850
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore if this person</font>

226
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,560
is inspiring you to do something better

227
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,230
for yourself to help you creatively

228
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,120
through your life or to help you help

229
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,830
others that hero is a good thing yes and

230
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,170
however you know at some point you have

231
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,380
to take your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own identity and move</font>

232
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,510
forward with that you could probably

233
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,400
move farther than your hero you can

234
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,710
probably expired more than your hero has

235
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,860
ever done but your hero has given you

236
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,550
the inspiration to do more and so

237
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,960
therefore I guess it can be seen in

238
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,060
family senses know your family<font color="#E5E5E5"> parents</font>

239
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,740
always want<font color="#E5E5E5"> your kids to be better than</font>

240
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,630
solutely better than they have yes you

241
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,570
know they all parents want their always

242
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,820
parents want their children have more

243
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,410
than what they have yes that's that's

244
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,940
normal but you know at some point you're

245
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,340
the hero can always be an inspiration

246
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,070
but at some point your own identity must

247
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,790
take precedence of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course and that</font>

248
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,580
identity that you become suddenly

249
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,980
becomes a hero to someone else right I

250
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,380
guess it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that you know no</font>

251
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">matter what ideas your heroes providing</font>

252
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,460
as the catalyst you're never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

253
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,010
able to you will never betray exactly

254
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,660
what they were thinking anyway so you've

255
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,580
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be real to yourself actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

256
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,080
with the one thing can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be certain I can</font>

257
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually do anything you're on your own</font>

258
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:45,030
mind cool um I think uh that was it I

259
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">was just gonna ask you also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am who is</font>

260
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,870
your hero I should across these off

261
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,750
batter on my part<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yet who are your</font>

262
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,370
heroes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I of course I have a few</font>

263
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,970
heroes in my life<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of my heroes is my</font>

264
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,250
mother who inspired me to be an artist

265
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">and and I think</font>

266
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,740
her very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much because I well did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she</font>

267
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,590
what did she<font color="#CCCCCC"> do she was she's always</font>

268
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,280
been supportive she should always face

269
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,680
me in a direction towards art because

270
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,320
she always knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's what she</font>

271
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,760
always knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's what I always</font>

272
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,500
was more interested in any way so she

273
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,870
always was very supportive and whatever

274
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,490
i did with neither music painting or

275
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,580
photography or writing so she was very

276
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">supportive and everything I've done</font>

277
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,640
artistically and she<font color="#E5E5E5"> supports me so</font>

278
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,690
that's obvious obvious ly you know

279
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,380
there's always a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my heroes of</font>

280
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,580
some point selling a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> McCain</font>

281
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:51,660
musicians Martin Luther<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the new the</font>

282
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,910
later the later<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Protestant</font>

283
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,580
Reformation he's a hero because he was

284
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,620
such a rebel yes against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Catholic</font>

285
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,910
Church that to me that's inspiring you

286
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,790
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> he risked everything for his</font>

287
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,770
beliefs yes that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

288
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,450
life's all about you must risk

289
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,850
everything for what you believe in and

290
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,520
if you've become a slave to society

291
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,300
become a slave to an institution then

292
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,890
you become part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that institution that</font>

293
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,880
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in you know after a</font>

294
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,560
while<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had some you know Bono it was a</font>

295
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,200
inspiration because one his vocals and

296
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,360
then you know the his band and then you

297
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">know then what he's done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with his</font>

298
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,340
humanitarian work over the years and

299
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,110
inspired you on a subconscious level in

300
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sense that I think when fear factory</font>

301
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,960
first formed it was because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were</font>

302
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,820
heard singing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> two in the shower I</font>

303
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">love them that's not me being a weird I</font>

304
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,560
like what was that it was it was on the

305
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,690
DVD at night as well as a well-known

306
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,960
story Nick Cave became a huge

307
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,810
inspiration for a long time before his

308
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,380
writing I noticed in a cave<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I</font>

309
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">was writing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> musical style</font>

310
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,140
first of all but I'd be because he's

312
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,120
storyteller that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be like</font>

00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:25,100
so that's that was one another hero oh I

317
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,600

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,300
people people would never a think they

319
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,950
have one main hero but as you evolve

327
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,180

332
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,810
do is inspiration can even be someone
