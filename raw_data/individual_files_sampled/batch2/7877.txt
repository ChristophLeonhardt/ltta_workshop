senator bob Corker comes out and says the donald trump could start World War three and that the adults around him are in the act of doing adult daycare and and that if it wasn't for the adults in the room that the child known as the President Trump could start any degree of conflict in the world and it would be completely reckless and drive off the road so first some reporters reactions to this Benjy Saarland rights in corkers sudden turn makes you wonder what other senators would be saying if they never had to worry about re-election again that's certainly true and and apparently according to corker the entire caucus almost the entire caucus knows that in fact the president is dangerous and a child so Haley Byrd then comes in and says bob Corker goes on the record with a view many congressional Republicans have privately expressed for months and we had Susan Collins caught on tape a little while back talking to a Democratic colleague also saying that she's worried about the mental stability of Donald Trump look these are weird amazing times where we have a president who is mentally unstable look that's not a political attack it's not hyperbole that is according to Republicans the state of affairs today now bob corker is admitted to publicly some have been caught admitting it privately but apparently almost all of them know it this is the state of the world so of course what is the administration going to do they're going to counter-attack o'course so they do it with Kelly Anne found a way this ought to be good first she sends a tweet she says about Bob corkers quotes incredibly irresponsible really you're gonna say someone else's tweets are incredibly irresponsible that's hilarious here she is on TV saying the same thing we've all worked with senator corker over the years we thank him for a service but I find tweets like this to be incredibly irresponsible and AD City insulting that the mainstream media and the president's detractors almost a year after this election they still can't accept the election results there it adds to their ability and their cover to speak about a President of the United States the president I states in ways that no president should be talked about how about no president should ever talk about other people in those ways I mean what kind of a president goes around tweeting about how oh well I you know he begged for my endorsement about bob Corker those are tweets and of course as always who started it Donald Trump started it he sent her with his insane irresponsible tweets against a fellow a Republican look I love Republican infighting I like tacos so god bless but this is serious stuff this isn't about normal political infighting this is about we've got a dangerous guy in office and they turn around going can you believe that bob Corker has been some irresponsible tweets with a straight face when you need someone to say something preposterous but do it with a straight face Kelly con Kellyanne Conway is your person for that but she's not alone they had tweeted out that segment from Fox & Friends but we've got more Fox outrage at everyone but Trump i whatever bob Corker thought he could have done it personally and privately the president takes his calls they golf together so they go public with these critiques or just I think it's self service respectful yeah but Trump went public first he went and said the tweets saying that it you know he basically ran bob Corker out of town and then he wouldn't endorse him and that's why he had to run and he has no guts and all that stuff and you just conveniently leave that out and go yeah I get your response oh I can't believe is no respect thank you to it publicly why don't you just call him why didn't Donna Trump call him why didn't Donald Trump call his own Secretary of State instead of saying hey you know give it a break Rex don't do diplomacy with North Korea you've got a phone it's the White House make the call but if the president needs fluffing fox and friends is there to forum there ready to step up and serve they surf at the pleasure of the president indeed help us build independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm / join
