20
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:45,602
UNCANNILY SIMILAR WAY.

>> WE HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF MOB

29
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:13,597
SCENES WHERE LEADERS OF THE

30
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:16,300
DEMOCRATS AND THE REPUBLICANS

31
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:17,200
WERE BOTH PUBLICLY HARASSED.

32
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:19,269
OF ANGRY PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT.

33
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,038
IT IS NOT MADE UP ITS UGLY, IT

34
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,873

00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:26,677
BOTH PARTIES NEED TO ACCEPT

36
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:26,977
THAT.

37
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:27,678

41
00:01:32,183 --> 00:01:39,589
TO LOOK NEUTRAL.

42
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,857
THESE HATE FILLED MOBS IS NOT

43
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:41,591
JUST THE DEMOCRATS.

44
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:42,326
REPUBLICANS DO IT TOO.

45
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:42,826
IT IS BOTH SIDES.

46
00:01:42,827 --> 00:01:43,627
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?

47
00:01:43,628 --> 00:01:44,594

WHEN IT COMES TO EVERYTHING.

78
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:50,861
A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE,

NEVERMIND A LACK OF CIVILITY.

THAT IS THE LANGUAGE OF CIVIL

89
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,057

90
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:20,991
IT IS NOT BOTH SIDES, IT IS THE

91
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,292
LEFT DRIVING THE HATE AND

92
00:03:22,293 --> 00:03:22,993
INTOLERANCE AND VIOLENCE AND

93
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:23,293
RAGE.

94
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:24,094
AND THEY HAVE BEEN EVER SINCE

95
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:26,029
2016 WHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

96
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,264
VOTED FOR REAL CHANGE AND

97
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:28,165

SEEM TO LOVE SO MUCH.

101
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:35,472

00:03:35,473 --> 00:03:36,139
SAME ESTABLISHMENT WITH HIS

103
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,773
POMPOUS NORMS AND CORRUPT

104
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:37,474
CIVILITY, RUIN THE LIVES OF

105
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:38,175
MILLIONS OF WORKING AMERICANS.

106
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,176
THIS RAGE AND HATE AND

107
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,778
INTOLERANCE ON THE LEFT IS ALL

108
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:44,581
PART OF THE COLLAPSE OF THE

109
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:45,082
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

110
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,083
THEY ONCE STOOD FOR WORKING

111
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:48,952
PEOPLE BUT NOW, IT'S

112
00:03:48,953 --> 00:03:49,986
UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION, IT

113
00:03:49,987 --> 00:03:51,488
HURTS THE WORKING CLASS MOST.

114
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:52,589
THEY USED TO BE AGAINST BIG

115
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,356
MONEY AND POLITICS BUT NOW THEY

116
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:56,326
OVERLAP IN THE LIKES OF GEORGE

117
00:03:56,327 --> 00:03:56,626
SOROS.

118
00:03:56,627 --> 00:04:04,801
THEY SAY THAT FOR WOMEN BUT

119
00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:05,735
MAKE EXCUSES FOR THEIR OWN

120
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:06,069
ABUSERS.

121
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,237
WHETHER IS KEITH ELLISON IN

122
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:08,205
MINNESOTA OR BILL CLINTON IN

ELIZABETH WARREN.

129
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,146
HE ONCE MADE A COMPELLING AND

130
00:04:17,148 --> 00:04:17,948
SUBSTANTIVE CASE AGAINST

POPULISM FOR DIVISIVE IDENTITY

135
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:25,388
POLITICS.

136
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:29,092
KNOWING IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO

137
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:29,960
MAKE IT AS A DEMOCRAT TODAY.

138
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:30,760
WHAT A PATHETIC SPECTACLE.

139
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:31,695
IT IS NOW TIME FOR THE SINCERE

AND OTHERS THAT MAY HAVE SOME

143
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:40,737
WRONG IDEAS BUT AT LEAST

144
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,639
ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE LIVES

145
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,206

146
00:04:43,207 --> 00:00:00,000
