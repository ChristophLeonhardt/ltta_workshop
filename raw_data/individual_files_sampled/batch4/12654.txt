what do you think is the best proof for a soul this is one I've personally had a tough time with because the truth is that the Old Testament isn't big it's big on the idea of that there's a soul because it says right in Genesis that God breathes breath into Adam and all of this but there's nothing in the Old Testament that explicitly references the idea of an afterlife for example so what's the rationale case I know that you've discussed this before what's the rationale case for the idea of a soul what exactly is a soul what is there is there a rational case for an afterlife or is that just something that we've made up to comfort ourselves I would say that the the the arguments for immortality that I think are the most impressive and actually these are arguments that for whatever reason end up being a little bit philosophically more technical than the arguments for God's existence or at least it's a little bit harder to state them in a non-technical way but the arguments that I have in mind focus on what's unique about the human intellect the human power of rationality which other animals don't have other animals are clever in certain ways they can you know they can they can hunt prey and they can solve certain problems you know but what they don't have is the idea to grasp abstract ideas abstract concepts the sort of thing that we express in language in distinctively human language that's the difference in human beings that entails when you unpack it and this is something that Plato argues Aristotle argues this as well Thomas Aquinas argues this as well when you impact this idea of the human intellect you'll find that it's a power in us it's a capacity that's not material that is to say it's not entirely grounded in bodily processes not even neural processes processes in the brain now they don't deny Aristotle and Aquinas certainly would not deny that brain activity is part of what's going on when we think but they would argue that can't be the whole story that which you can't with what matter by itself will not give you is the kind of meaning that you have in a human thought or in a sentence that you write in a human language it expresses a human thought that's an a non physical or immaterial aspect to human nature now because if that's the case then because it's the case when hew means die what happens is we lose our bodily capacities we walk and we talk those things depend on bodily organs like arms and legs and mouths and so forth we digest food that depends on a bodily capacity bodily organs like having a stomach we see in here that depends on bodily organs like eyes and ears those things are gone but at least part of what we do even when we're alive namely thinking in the abstract thought of the sort that even the the the least intellectual human being is capable of can still grasp abstract ideas that's something that for Plato and for Aristotle and for Thomas Aquinas is not a physical or material power of human nature it's something that we do even more alive that is immaterial and so that aspect of us does not go out go out of existence at death it carries on beyond death and that's the foundation in these writers for an argument for the immortality of the human soul that there's an aspect of human nature what's highest in us namely our capacity for thought that survives the death of the body so even without a brain even without any any ability to function in the physical world there is something else but we can't quite define what exactly that is that is this arises after word I don't want to say we can't define I think we can define I think I would say I mean the short answer would be that it's the human intellect the human mind that survives the death of the body and that cannot be entirely explained in terms of a reduced to brain activity
