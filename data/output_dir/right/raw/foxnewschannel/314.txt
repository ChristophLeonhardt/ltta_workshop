THAT IS THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

3
00:00:04,761 --> 00:00:07,663
ANGLE.

4
00:00:07,664 --> 00:00:08,664
SO FAR DEMOCRATS SEEM TO HAVE

5
00:00:08,665 --> 00:00:11,166
LEARNED NOTHING FROM THEIR

6
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:14,470
FUTILE BATTLE AGAINST THE BRETT

00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:15,471
KAVANAUGH NOMINATION.

8
00:00:15,472 --> 00:00:16,939
THEY PUT THE COUNTRY THROUGH

9
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,441
THREE WEEKS OF WHAT BASICALLY

10
00:00:19,442 --> 00:00:23,078
AMOUNTED TO A HE SAID, SHE SAID.

11
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:27,049
>> I THOUGHT THAT BRETT WAS

12
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,083
ACCIDENTALLY GOING TO KILL ME.

13
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:29,919
>> Judge Kavanaugh: I HAVE

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,220
NEVER DONE THIS TO HER OR

15
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:31,654
ANYONE.

ACTIVIST TO CORNER SENATORS.

18
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:36,692
>> YOU ARE ALLOWING SOMEONE WHO

19
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:37,693
IS UNWILLING TO TAKE

20
00:00:37,694 --> 00:00:38,327
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS OWN

21
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:39,728
ACTIONS TO SIT IN THE HIGHEST

22
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:45,200
COURT OF THE COUNTRY.

23

THAT RANGED FROM IN    ON HINGEO

27
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:55,878
DOWNRIGHT PATHETIC.

28
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,280
>> WE ARE ABOUT TO MARCH!

29
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:06,322
WE NEED EVERYONE TO PAY

30
00:01:06,323 --> 00:01:08,257
ATTENTION.

31
00:01:08,258 --> 00:01:10,359
>> Laura: I'M NOT PAYING

32
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,060
ATTENTION.

33
00:01:11,061 --> 00:01:14,063
CAN SHE LEARN SOME RHYMES EVERY

34
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:15,064
NOW AND THEN?

35
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:16,765
THEY USE THEIR PALS IN THE PRESS

36
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:18,867
TO RUN WITH THE MOST OUTLANDISH

37
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:22,905
SUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS POSSIBLE.

38
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:24,373
>> BRETT KAVANAUGH PLUNGES

39
00:01:24,374 --> 00:01:25,874
DEEPER INTO DANGER TONIGHT OVER

40
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,477
NAVIGATION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT THE

41
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:30,746
LEAVES HIS CONFIRMATION IN

42
00:01:30,747 --> 00:01:32,481
MORTAL JEOPARDY.

AND THE LATE-BREAKING NEWS OF A

45
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:40,956
FOURTH ACCUSER.

>> SHE CONSIDERS HIS OWN

47
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:43,692
MEMORIES CREDIBLE AND SHE FELT

48
00:01:43,693 --> 00:01:45,661
IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT SHE TELL

49
00:01:45,662 --> 00:01:46,895
HER STORY BEFORE OTHERS DID

50
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:50,065
WITHOUT HER CONSENT.

51
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:51,667
>> Laura: DESPITE ALL THEIR

EFFORTS, THE EMOTIONAL PLEAS AND

53

ALL THE BIG MONEY BEHIND THEIR

54
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:58,073
SMEARS, ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON,

55
00:01:58,074 --> 00:01:59,541
KAVANAUGH WAS CONFIRMED BY THE

56
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:00,309
U.S. SENATE.

57
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,044
SO AFTER THEIR SPECTACULAR

58
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:03,679
FLAMEOUT, ONE OF THE

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,481
DEMOCRATS -- WHAT DO THE

60
00:02:05,482 --> 00:02:08,250
DEMOCRATS DO IN RESPONSE?

61
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:09,852
THEY DOUBLE DOWN ON FAILURE.

62
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:12,855
>> IF HE IS ON THE SUPREME COURT

63
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:14,289
AND THE SENATE HADN'T

64
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,291
INVESTIGATED, THEN THE HOUSE

65
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:16,725
WILL HAVE TWO.

66
00:02:16,726 --> 00:02:17,860
>> YOU WILL INVESTIGATE?

67
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:21,063
>> WE WOULD HAVE TO INVESTIGATE

68
00:02:21,064 --> 00:02:21,897
ANY CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS.

69
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:23,298
>> I'M TOTALLY FOCUSED WITH ALL

70
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:25,300
THE ANGRY WOMAN AND THE MEN WHO

71
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:27,202
LISTENED TO WOMEN AND SUPPORT

72
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:30,305
THE CREDIBLE ACCOUNTS OF

73
00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:30,906
SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND

74
00:02:30,907 --> 00:02:33,308
SEXUAL ASSAULT WHICH IS A VERY

75
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:34,376
UNDERREPORTED, BUT I'M FOCUSED

76
00:02:34,377 --> 00:02:36,879
ON THE LASER BEAM ABOUT THE

77
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,246
ELECTIONS.

78
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:38,747
>> THERE ARE SIGNS THAT THIS

79
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:40,349
ANGRY GENDER POLITICS GAME IS

80
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:40,883
NOT WORKING.

81
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:42,351
A A MARIST POLL LAST WEEK FOUND

82
00:02:42,352 --> 00:02:44,453
THAT THERE WAS VIRTUALLY NO

83
00:02:44,454 --> 00:02:46,689
VENDOR GAP WHEN IT COMES TO

84
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,490
JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH.

85
00:02:48,491 --> 00:02:49,692
AMONG EITHER REPUBLICANS OR

86
00:02:49,693 --> 00:02:50,693
DEMOCRATS.

87
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:52,895
80% OF REPUBLICAN WOMEN HAVE A

88
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:56,965
FAVORABLE VIEW OF KAVANAUGH WITH

89
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:59,868
81% OF REPUBLICAN MEN AGREEING.

90
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:01,970
THEN MEN HAVE A GREATER

91
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:04,873
UNFAVORABLE VIEW OF KAVANAUGH,

92
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:08,877
85%, TO 75% OF WOMEN.

93
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:09,611
THE STRUGGLE OVER KAVANAUGH AS

94
00:03:09,612 --> 00:03:11,480
WE NOTED IN THE ANKLE SHORTLY

95
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:13,615
AFTER HE WAS NOMINATED WAS

96
00:03:13,616 --> 00:03:16,285
ALWAYS GOING TO BE POLITICAL.

97
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:17,753
THE DEMOCRATS WERE GOING TO

98
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:20,522
SAVAGE ANYONE DONALD TRUMP NOT

99
00:03:20,523 --> 00:03:22,658
KNOW MIKE NOMINATED EXCEPT

100
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:24,093
MAYBE, IF HE RENOMINATED SOMEONE

101
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:27,830
LIKE MARY GARLAND OR SOMEONE

102
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:29,698
COMPLETELY CUCKOO LIKE THAT.

103
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:32,000
THE PERPETUAL RAGE AGAINST ALL

104
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:35,504
THINGS TRUMP ALSO SEEMS TO

105
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:36,672
INTENSIFY THE MORE TRUMP

106
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:37,106
ACCOMPLISHES.

107
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:39,141
AND IT'S UNRELATED BY THE WAY TO

108
00:03:39,142 --> 00:03:41,477
HOW OPTIMISTIC AND HOW CONFIDENT

109
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:43,011
AMERICAN WORKERS AND CONSUMERS

110
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:44,279
ARE ABOUT THE ECONOMY.

111
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,682
NONE OF THAT EVEN MATTERS TO THE

112
00:03:46,683 --> 00:03:48,884
CRAZIES ON THE LEFT.

113
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:49,551
CONSIDER WHAT THE PRESIDENT,

114
00:03:49,552 --> 00:03:51,286
WITH THE HELP OF MITCH

115
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:52,488
McCONNELL, HAS ACCOMPLISHED

116
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:54,490
JUST ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT

117
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:56,892
ISSUE OF JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS?

118
00:03:56,893 --> 00:04:00,696
OF COURSE, TO SUPREME COURT

119
00:04:00,697 --> 00:04:02,297
JUSTICES, 26 FEDERAL APPELLATE

120
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:05,033
COURT JUSTICES, AND 41 FEDERAL

121
00:04:05,034 --> 00:04:06,468
DISTRICT COURT JUDGES.

122
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:09,071
AND BY THE WAY, THEY ARE JUST

123
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:09,872
GETTING STARTED.

124
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:11,273
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS CHALKED UP

125
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:12,307
SO MANY OTHER IMPRESSIVE WINS

126
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:13,442
AND GETS VERY LITTLE CREDIT IN

127
00:04:13,443 --> 00:04:16,078
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA FOR IT.

128
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,113
HE SUCCESSFULLY RENEGOTIATED

129
00:04:18,113 --> 00:04:19,680
NAFTA, FORCING BOTH MEXICO AND

130
00:04:19,682 --> 00:04:23,452
CANADA TO ACCEPT A DEAL THAT

131
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:25,587
FINALLY BEGINS TO TREAT AMERICAN

132
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:27,956
MANUFACTURERS AND AMERICAN

133
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:33,862
WORKERS FAIRLY.

134
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:35,564
HE IS A ROLLBACK NEEDLESS

135
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:36,865
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.

136
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:38,967
BY THE WAY, FOR EVERY NEW

137
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:40,969
REGULATION, THE TRUMP FEDERAL

138
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,405
AGENCY, THEY BASICALLY RESCINDED

139
00:04:43,406 --> 00:04:43,672
22.

140
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:44,873
THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES THAT

141
00:04:44,874 --> 00:04:47,376
THE IN LIFETIME NET COST SAVINGS

142
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:50,245
OF HIS DEREGULATORY EFFORTS IS

143
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:56,685
ABOUT $8.1 BILLION.

144
00:04:56,686 --> 00:04:57,486
[CHANTING]

145
00:04:57,487 --> 00:04:59,021
>> Laura: CAN'T PASS THE

146
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:01,256
LARGEST TAX CUT IN A GENERATION,

147
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:03,425
MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE BACK, THE

148
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:06,295
GDP IS ABOVE 4% AND WE HAVE THE

149
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:08,797
LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT IN NEARLY 50

150
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:14,436
YEARS.

151
00:05:14,437 --> 00:05:15,571
TRUMP IS TAKING ON CHINA FOR

152
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:17,306
THEIR YEARS OF CHEATING AND

153
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:18,974
STEALING FROM THE AMERICAN

154
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,477
WORKERS AND AMERICAN BUSINESSES.

155
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:23,478
FINALLY, WE HAVE AN

156
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:24,246
ADMINISTRATION THAT RECOGNIZES

157
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:27,115
THE THREAT THAT THIS EXPANSIVE

158
00:05:27,116 --> 00:05:28,417
COMP COMIC COMMUNIST REGIME

159
00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:29,651
POSES TO OUR OWN NATIONAL AND

160
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:39,094
ECONOMIC SECURITY.

161
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:40,863
TRUMP IS TRANSFORMING BOTH THE

162
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:42,331
COUNTRY AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

163
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:44,533
AND NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON.

164
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:49,004
EVEN THE RANKS OF SOME OF THE

165
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:50,873
NEVER-TRUMPERS HAVE DWINDLED AND

166
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:53,475
THEY COULD BE BEGRUDGINGLY ADMIT

167
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:55,344
THE GENIUS OF DONALD TRUMP.

168
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:56,678
THE KAVANAUGH WAS A CLARIFYING

169
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:59,481
MOMENT FOR THE NEVER-TRUMPER

170
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:00,582
CROWD, LIKE A POLITICAL

171
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:00,983
ASTRINGENT.

172
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:05,354
BRETT STEVENS, HUGH HEWITT AND

173
00:06:05,355 --> 00:06:06,288
ERICK ERICKSON ALL LINED UP

174
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:07,890
BEHIND HIM IN THE FIGHT.

175
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:09,791
BY THE WAY, REMEMBER, THIS WAS

176
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,894
ERICK ERICKSON WHO WAS HEAD OF

177
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:12,995
THAT RED STATE WEBSITE BACK IN

178
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:16,331
AUGUST OF 2015.

179
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:18,267
>> I WANTED TO GIVE THE MAN A

180
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:19,635
LOT OF LATITUDE BECAUSE I KNOW

181
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:21,136
HE TAPS INTO SOME ANGER THAT

182
00:06:21,137 --> 00:06:23,071
EVEN I SHARE WITH THE REPUBLICAN

183
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:25,507
PARTY, AND A LOT OF US HERE DO.

184
00:06:25,508 --> 00:06:26,575
BUT IF OUR STANDARD-BEARER HAS

185
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:30,946
TO RESORT TO THAT, WE NEED A NEW

186
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:32,447
STANDARD-BEARER.

187
00:06:32,448 --> 00:06:34,683
>> AND THIS IS ERIC ERICKSON TO

188
00:06:34,684 --> 00:06:36,685
THE "WASHINGTON EXAMINER" LAST

WEEK."

190
00:06:37,854 --> 00:06:40,555
FOR THE FIRST TIME I SEE MYSELF

191
00:06:40,556 --> 00:06:42,724
VOTING FOR TRUMP IN 2,020.

192
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:45,894
IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH

193
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:46,261
KAVANAUGH.

194
00:06:46,262 --> 00:06:47,596
HE'S NOT THE ONLY REASON BUT HE

195
00:06:47,597 --> 00:06:48,964
IS DEFINITELY THE STRAW THAT

196
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:51,833
BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK.

197
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,135
IT IS ERIC CALLING HIMSELF A

198
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:55,871
CAMEL OR IS THAT THE LEFT?

199
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:57,673
ANYWAY, I'M HAPPY, I'M GLAD.

200
00:06:57,674 --> 00:06:59,675
ERIC IS A GOOD GUY.

201
00:06:59,676 --> 00:07:00,409
OF COURSE ESTABLISHMENT FIGURES

202
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:05,681
SUCH AS LINDSAY GRAHAM AND

203
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:06,381
McCONNELL, NONE OF THOSE GUYS

204
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:07,215
WANTED TRUMP TO BE THE NOMINEE.

205
00:07:07,216 --> 00:07:11,687
THEY'VE ALL REALLY STEPPED UP

206
00:07:11,688 --> 00:07:12,688
HELPING TO PUSH KAVANAUGH OVER

207
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:15,290
THE CONFIRMATION FINISH LINE.

208
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,292
MAYBE THEY ARE CLOSER, ALL OF

209
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:18,694
THEM COME UP TO RECOGNIZING THAT

210
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:20,929
THE TIME IS UP ON THE OLD G.O.P.

211
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,731
AND IT TRUMP'S POLICIES ARE

212
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:25,300
ACTUALLY BEARING FRUIT.

213
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:26,702
ALL THE EXCITEMENT IS WITH

214
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:27,703
TRUMP, LET'S FACE IT.

215
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:29,771
ALL THE MOMENTUM IS WITH HIS

216
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:30,238
IDEAS.

217
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:33,375
THERE IS TOO MUCH ON THE LINE

218
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:34,876
FOR INTRAPARTY SQUABBLES ANY

219
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:35,210
LONGER.

220
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:36,945
THE CHOICE FOR VOTERS IS NOW

221
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:39,514
REALLY SIMPLE.

222
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:43,652
MOB RULE, OR THE RULE OF LAW.

223
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:48,090
PERPETUAL RAGE, OR REAL RESULTS?

224
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:51,693
DEMONIZATION, OR DUE PROCESS?

225
00:07:51,694 --> 00:07:53,128
AS AN EXAMPLE, THIS IS WHAT THE

226
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:55,897
ANTI-TRUMP RAGE MACHINE WAS UP

227
00:07:55,898 --> 00:07:57,099
TO OVER THE WEEKEND.

228
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,633
PROTESTERS IN PORTLAND BLOCKED A

229
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:00,802
MAJOR THOROUGHFARE CAUSING

230
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:01,903
NEEDLESS DISRUPTIONS.

231
00:08:01,904 --> 00:08:03,772
WHEN A DRIVER DARED TO PUSH

232
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:06,174
THROUGH THE BLOCKADE, THIS WAS

233
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:08,343
THE REACTION OF THESE

234
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:10,379
OPEN-MINDED AND TOLERANT

235
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:16,752
LEFTISTS.

236
00:08:16,753 --> 00:08:32,100

BENGHAZI.

240
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:39,174
THE FAR LEFT, LET'S FACE IT, IS

241
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:40,875
NOW RUNNING THE DEMOCRATIC

242
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:41,208

243

244
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:43,845

245
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:44,613
SHIFTED SO FAR LEFT THAT WE WILL

246
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:48,884
END UP    UP AND VENEZUELA.

247
00:08:48,885 --> 00:08:50,485
THIS COUNTRY WILL END UP BEING

248
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:50,852
VENEZUELA.

249
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:52,821
I THINK A LOT OF DEMOCRATS WILL

250
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:56,691
BE VOTING.
