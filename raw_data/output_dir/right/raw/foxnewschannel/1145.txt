00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:49,798
YOU SAID IT HAPPENED AT 10

79
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:53,802
O'CLOCK, A MASS PSYCHOSIS THAT

80
00:02:53,802 --> 00:02:54,169
CONTINUES.

>> I LISTENED EARLIER.

82
00:02:55,103 --> 00:02:57,739
I THOUGHT, I THINK THAT WAS MY

83
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:58,807
LINE ORIGINALLY.

84
00:02:58,807 --> 00:03:01,376
>> Sean: I TOTALLY STOLE IT BUT

85
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:03,345
GAVE YOU CREDIT SO PEOPLE KNOW

86
00:03:03,345 --> 00:03:04,045
IT'S TRUE.

87
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:06,648
AN IMPORTANT POINT.

00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:09,317
YOU GO THROUGH CHAPTER BY

89
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:12,220

THEN YOU HAVE PART 2 OF YOUR

93
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:17,592
BOOK.

94
00:03:17,592 --> 00:03:19,861
PART 2 IS THE DANGERS THAT THE

95
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:21,129
PRESIDENT FACES STARTING WITH

96
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:22,530
THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA.

97
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,466
GIVE US A TASTE OF THAT.

98
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:26,101
>> WELL, LOOK, THE PRESIDENT

00:03:26,101 --> 00:03:29,070
FACES -- FIRST LET ME SAY, THE

100
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,005
SUCCESS OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS

101
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:31,339
SO ENORMOUS.

102
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:33,375
JUST ONE THING THAT CAME OUT

103
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:33,675
TODAY.

104
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:35,343
THEY ANNOUNCED TODAY THERE ARE

105
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:37,679
MORE JOB OPENINGS IN THE UNITED

106
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:39,814
STATES THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE

107
00:03:39,814 --> 00:03:41,149
LOOKING FOR WORK.

108
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:43,752
NOW, THAT IS SUCH AN ENORMOUS

109
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:47,656
CHANGE FROM THE OBAMA YEARS AND

110
00:03:47,656 --> 00:03:49,257
FROM THE BUSH YEARS.

111
00:03:49,257 --> 00:03:51,293
IT'S ALMOST REVOLUTIONARY HOW

112
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:54,396
MUCH HE ACCOMPLISHED IN 500

113
00:03:54,396 --> 00:03:54,929
DAYS.

114
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:57,065
THAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE

115
00:03:57,065 --> 00:03:57,499
ACHIEVEMENTS.

116
00:03:57,499 --> 00:03:58,700
THE CHALLENGES ARE STILL THERE.

117
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,936
I THINK IT WILL BE INTERESTING

118
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:05,340
TO SEE IF THE PRESIDENT CAN

119
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:05,907
FOCUS IN.

120
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:07,342
THE PRESIDENCY IS SO BIG AND SO

121
00:04:07,342 --> 00:04:10,045
ALL CONSUMING, YOU CAN LOSE YOUR

122
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:11,346
FOCUS ON OCCASION.

123
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:15,617
HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB WITH

124
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:17,152
DEREGULATION AND CONSERVATIVE

125
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:17,485
JUDGES.

126
00:04:17,485 --> 00:04:19,220
THE TAX CUTS ARE WORKING AS WE

127
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,156
THOUGHT THEY WOULD IN MAKING

128
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:23,692
AMERICA MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE.

129
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:27,262
NOW HE IS CONFRONTING THE DEEP

130
00:04:27,262 --> 00:04:29,431
STATE IN A FOUND WAY.

131
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:30,565
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION.

132
00:04:30,565 --> 00:04:31,866
>> Sean: WILL WEIN?

133
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:32,500
>> PROBABLY.

134
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,337
BECAUSE TRUMP IS A REMARKABLE

135
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:35,870
LEADER.

136
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,906
WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND

137
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:45,180
UNDER-ESTIMATE THE BUREAUCRACY

138
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,748
AND THE INTEREST GROUPS THAT

139
00:04:46,748 --> 00:04:50,318
WANT TO AVOID THE CHANGES TRUMP

140
00:04:50,318 --> 00:04:53,154
AND PENCE WANT OR THE PENTAGON

141
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:54,756
WANTS TO SPEND MONEY ON THE OLD

142
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:58,259
THINGS THAT MAKE THEM HAPPEN OR.

143
00:04:58,259 --> 00:04:59,994
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT IS

144
00:04:59,994 --> 00:05:03,665
DESPERATELY TRYING TO AVOID THE

145
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:05,266
TRUTH.

146
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:07,102
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE SYSTEM

147
00:05:07,102 --> 00:05:10,438
IS MORE DEEPLY CORRUPT THAN ANY

148
00:05:10,438 --> 00:05:12,474
OF US COULD IMAGINE.

149
00:05:12,474 --> 00:05:16,411
AS IT IS COMING OUT IN THE OPEN,

150
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:18,113
ELEMENT OF THE JUSTICE

151
00:05:18,113 --> 00:05:20,715
DEPARTMENT, AND THE FBI, WERE

152
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:22,617
CORRUPTED ON A SCALE THAT IS

153
00:05:22,617 --> 00:05:26,154
REALLY A THREAT TO THE WHOLE

154
00:05:26,154 --> 00:05:27,122
AMERICAN SYSTEM.

155
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:32,594
>> Sean: WHERE ARE THE MEDIA IN

156
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:39,968
THE BIGGEST ABUSE OF POWER

157
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:42,003
CORRUPTION SCANDAL IN OUR

158
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:42,370
LIFETIME?

159
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,473
WE KNOW WHAT THE CONCLUSION IS

160
00:05:45,473 --> 00:05:49,444
SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE INSPECTOR

161
00:05:49,444 --> 00:05:51,012
GENERAL'S REPORT.

162
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:52,781
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GET IT IN

163
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:53,515
MARCH AND APRIL.

164
00:05:53,515 --> 00:05:56,418
ARE THEY GOING TO BURY?

165
00:05:56,418 --> 00:05:58,319
TWO WEEKS ROB ROSENSTEIN AND

166
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,423
COMPANY HAD OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY

167
00:06:01,423 --> 00:06:05,927
AND GET THE INSPECTOR GENERAL TO

168
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:08,163
SOFTEN THE BLOW AND MAKE

169
00:06:08,163 --> 00:06:11,599
CHANGESES AND CLAIM THEY NEED

170
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:12,934
REDACTIONS FOR NATIONAL

171
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:15,703
SECURITY.

172
00:06:15,837 --> 00:06:18,206
>> I DON'T EXACTLY SHARE YOUR

173
00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:18,573
WORRY.

174
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:22,944
THIS REPORT WILL BE SO BIG AND

175
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:26,080
SO DEVASTATING --

176
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,183
>> Sean: WHY DO YOU HAVE FAITH

177
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:30,919
IN THAT WE KNOW HILLARY CLINTON

178
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:31,719
OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE AND THE

179
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:32,787
INVESTIGATION WAS RIGGED.

180
00:06:32,787 --> 00:06:34,522
WE HAVE KNOWN THAT FOR A WHILE.

181
00:06:34,522 --> 00:06:35,056
>> RIGHT.

182
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:37,258
THE NUMBER 2 MAN IN THE FBI IS

183
00:06:37,258 --> 00:06:42,197
NOW UNDER CRIMINAL REFERRAL.

184
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:44,799
THE NUMBER 1 MAN WILL BE UNDER

185
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:46,034
CRIMINAL REFERRAL.

186
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:47,735
THESE THINGS ARE GRADUALLY

187
00:06:47,735 --> 00:06:48,903
COMING OUT.

188
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:50,605
THE AMERICAN SYSTEM IS GRINDING

189
00:06:50,605 --> 00:06:54,542
AWAY DESPITE THE FACT WE HAVE AN

190
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:55,577
UNBELIEVABLY WEAK ATTORNEY

191
00:06:55,577 --> 00:06:56,711
GENERAL AND A DEPUTY ATTORNEY

192
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:59,113
GENERAL WHO IS THE DEEP STATE

193
00:06:59,113 --> 00:07:02,484
AND I THINK IS TOTALLY

194
00:07:02,484 --> 00:07:02,951
UNRELIABLE.

195
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:07,455
YOU HAVE A WITCH HUNT LED BY

196
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:10,525
ROBERT MUELLER WHICH BROUGHT IN

197
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:13,361
ANTI-TRUMP LAWYERS SOME OF WHOM

198
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:14,496
HAVE TERRIBLE RECORDS OF ABUSE.

199
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:16,364
ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE OUT

200
00:07:16,364 --> 00:07:16,731
THERE.

201
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:19,834
MAYBE BECAUSE I AM A NAIVE

202
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,470
OPTIMIST, I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN

203
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,571
SYSTEM WORKS OVER TIME.

204
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:28,276
>> Sean: I HOPE YOU ARE RIGHT.

205
00:07:28,276 --> 00:07:29,744
>> THE LEVEL OF CORRUPTION WOULD

206
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:31,212
BE UNBELIEVABLE.

207
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:32,780
>> Sean: NOT ANY MIDDLE GROUND

208
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,616
IN THIS.

209
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:37,118
I WANT TO SAY YOUR BOOK IS THE

210
00:07:37,118 --> 00:07:38,419
DEFINITIVE BOOK THAT EXPLAINS

211
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:42,223
THE PRESIDENT'S SUCCESS IN 500

212
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:44,559
DAYS AND REAL CHALLENGE THE

213
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,627
PRESIDENT FACES FROM THE DEEP

214
00:07:45,627 --> 00:00:00,000
STATE AND THE MEDIA.
