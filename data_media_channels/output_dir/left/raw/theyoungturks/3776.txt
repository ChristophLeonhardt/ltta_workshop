1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,140
A ST.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,640
LOUIS PIZZA OWNER WAS
TEARGASSED DURING PROTESTS, BY

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,640
THE

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,830
POLICE, AND HE WANTS THE POLICE
CHIEF TO BE FIRED.

5
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,830
THIS IS PART

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,190
OF A GROWING MOVEMENT TO
DISPLACE AND GET RID OF THE

7
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,480
TEMPORARY POLICE CHIEF IN ST.

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,480
LOUIS.

9
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,480
WHAT'S THE STORY OF THE

10
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,480
PIZZERIA OWNER?

11
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,660
WELL, HIS NAME
IS CHRIS SUMMERS AND HE'S THE

12
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,360
OWNER OF PIE PIZZERIA, AND HE
SAID THAT HIS PLACE A FEW NIGHTS

13
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,849
AGO WAS TEARGASSED BY POLICE
OFFICERS WHO DIDN'T REALLY NEED

14
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,359
TO TEARGAS ANYONE BY HIS
ACCOUNTS, IT WAS ESCALATING A

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,570
SITUATION THAT WASN'T GOING TO
ESCALATE OTHERWISE.

16
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,570
THE POLICE

17
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,910
WERE ACTING INAPPROPRIATELY.

18
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,100
FOLLOWING THAT, THE POLICE UNION

19
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,660
AND THE BLUE LIVES MATTER
MOVEMENTS POSTED ON FACEBOOK A

20
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,019
CALL TO ACTION FOR A BUNCH OF
FOLKS OUT THERE TO ACTUALLY GO

21
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:50,690
AND CALL THE PIZZERIA UP AND
ESSENTIALLY HARASS THEM AND TIE

22
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,109
UP THEIR PHONE LINES IN THE
MEANTIME.

23
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:54,109
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

24
00:00:54,109 --> 00:01:25,979
THE ACTUAL QUOTE:

25
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,310
ANOTHER BUSINESS OWNER IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD, WHO OWNS A

26
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:43,300
BOOKSTORE SAYS:

27
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,439
SO THERE YOU GO.

28
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,900
AND THEIR THEY ARE SAYING
WHITE, I DON'T KNOW THE RACE OF

29
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,200
THE PERSON WHO SAID THAT,
MEANING THAT IT IS NOT

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMUNITY.

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
BEING EXTREMELY WHITE.

33
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,950
THEY ARE
JUST SAYING THIS IS NOT POLICE

34
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,049
FORCE THAT'S FROM THIS COMMUNITY
AND REPRESENTS THIS COMMUNITY,

35
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:03,229
AND YOU CAN TELL WHEN THE COPS
CLEARED OUT THE PROTESTERS ON

36
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:06,420
SUNDAY NIGHT, WHEN THEY STARTED
CHANTING, WHOSE STREETS?

37
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,420
OUR

38
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,419
STREETS.

39
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,419
WELL, NO.

40
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,728
YOU'RE
WORKING FOR THE CITIZENS.

41
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,450
THAT'S THEIR STREETS, AND THEY
PAY YOUR SALARY.

42
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,510
BUT THEY

43
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,830
CLEARLY IN THAT CHANT SHOW YOU
THAT THAT IS NOT THEIR ATTITUDE.

44
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,060
IT'S NOT THEIR FRAME OF MIND.

45
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,640
THEIR FRAME OF MIND IS, US

46
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,940
VERSUS THEM.

47
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,110
THE CITIZENS ARE
THE BAD GUYS AND NOW WE TOOK THE

48
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,700
STREETS AWAY FROM THEM.

49
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,840
REMEMBER, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
POLICING THE COMMUNITY ON

50
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,650
BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY.

51
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,159
I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT THE
RESTAURANT OWNERS ARE SPEAKING

52
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,159
OUT.

53
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,360
SOME OF THEM ARE DOING SO
WITHOUT DISCLOSING THEIR

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,730
IDENTITY BECAUSE THEY ARE
WORRIED EVER TELL YOU SHE AND,

55
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,770
BUT THE FACT THAT THESE
RESTAURANT OWNERS ARE NOW COMING

56
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,440
OUT AND SAYING NO, THIS INTERIM
POLICE CHIEF IS A PROBLEM.

57
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
WE

58
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,130
SAW POLICE OFFICERS ACTING IN A
WAY THAT ESCALATED THE

59
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,130
SITUATION.

60
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,670
THEY WERE USING DON
LETHAL WEAPONS EXCESSIVELY, EVEN

61
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,340
WHEN THEIR WORDS PROTESTERS IN
THE VICINITY AT THAT TIME, SO

62
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,540
LOOK, WE ALWAYS GET THE TWO
SIDES AND IT'S THE SIDE OF THE

63
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,610
PROTESTERS, THE SIDE OF THE
COPS.

64
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,420
THE COPS USUALLY HAVE A

65
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,580
WAY OF DOMINATING THE HEADLINES
AND MAKING IT APPEAR TO BE A

66
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,980
NUMBER OF VIOLENCE VANDALS WHO
ARE THROWING BRICKS THROUGH

67
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,880
WINDOWS AND THIS AND THAT, AND
IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR FROM

68
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,440
THOSE ACTUAL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO
WERE SAYING, NO.

69
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
THE PROBLEM

70
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,660
HERE IS THE WAY THAT THE
POLICING IS GOING DOWN.

71
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,799
WE NEED BETTER LEADERSHIP THERE.

72
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,370
YEAH, AND PART OF THE REASON
THIS IS MAKING NEWS IS BECAUSE

73
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,680
UNFORTUNATELY, BUSINESS LEADERS
HAVE MORE OF A VOICE THAT THE

74
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,049
MEDIA RESPECTS THAN THE AVERAGE
CITIZEN.

75
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,080
SO WHEN BUSINESS

76
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,760
LEADERS ARE LIKE HEY, THIS IS
NOT HELPING THIS AREA, PEOPLE

77
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,110
ARE LIKE WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.

78
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,659
THIS AFFECTS MY MONEY.

79
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:43,659
WE

80
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:44,659
SHOULD TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.

81
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:45,659
AND
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE,

82
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,200
BUT THE PERSON ON THE GROUND
THAT I'M SUPER PROUD OF THAT HAS

83
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,800
LED A LOT OF THESE PROTESTS IS
COREY BUSH.

84
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
COREY BUSH IS

85
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
ACTUALLY A JUSTICE DEMOCRAT.

86
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,209
SHE'S RUNNING FOR OFFICE, AND

87
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,209
IT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT.

88
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:55,790
PART OF
THE REASON TO JUSTICE DEMOCRATS

89
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,490
PICKED HER IS BECAUSE SHE HAS
BEEN LEADING PROTESTS, AND A

90
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,320
LEADER IN THE COMMUNITY ALL
THROUGHOUT.

91
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,549
I'M GOING TO GO TO

92
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:04,439
GRAPHIC 15.

93
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:14,500
WHEN 
THEY STARTED

94
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,660
DOING THE PROTESTS IN THE FIRST

95
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,290
PLACE, COREY BUSH SAID:

96
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:25,580
NOW OF COURSE, THE REASON THAT
PEOPLE WERE SO OUTRAGED IS

97
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,320
BECAUSE THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN IN
THAT CASE WAS SHOT AND HE HAD NO

98
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,810
DNA ON THE GUN AND THE COP DID
HAVE DNA ON THE GUN.

99
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,810
HE PAUSED,

100
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,900
FIRED THE LAST KILL SHOT.

101
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,260
I
MEAN, AND HE SAID, I'M GOING TO

102
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,870
GO KILL THE GUY BEFORE HAND AND
HE STILL WAS ACQUITTED.

103
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,870
IT WAS

104
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,670
A PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS CASE
AND COREY BUSH THEN LED A SILENT

105
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,690
PROTEST SO JUST TO MAKE A POINT,
WHICH IS SUCH A GREAT IDEA.

106
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,720
THEY KEEP SAYING WE'RE CHANCING
THE WRONG THINGS.

107
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
THEY KEEP

108
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
SAYING THAT WERE VIOLENCE, ETC.

109
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO

110
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
DO?

111
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
FINE.

112
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
WE WILL HAVE A
COMPLETELY SILENT PROTEST.

113
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
12

114
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,330
PEOPLE, LINES OF 12 PEOPLE
LOCKED ARMS PROTESTING

115
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,100
THROUGHOUT THE STREETS AND SHE
SAID AT THE END OF THAT PROTEST,

116
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,670
THE PURPOSE OF THIS ACTION WAS
TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT OUR

117
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,190
PRESENCE IS POWERFUL.

118
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,530
THIS WAS
POWER WALKING DOWN THE STREET.

119
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,820
AND SHE SAID, WE ARE NOT AFRAID
OF BEING ARRESTED.

120
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,820
WE'RE NOT

121
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,820
AFRAID OF BEING TALKED ABOUT.

122
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,150
WE'RE NOT AFRAID TO DO WHATEVER

123
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,520
IT TAKES TO SAY TO THEM, YOU
WILL STOP KILLING US.

124
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
THAT'S

125
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
POWERFUL.

126
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,090
SO THANKS TO COREY
BUSH FOR DOING THAT.

127
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,090
SHE WAS

128
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,760
ACTUALLY THE VERY FIRST
CANDIDATE FOR JUSTICE DEMOCRATS.

129
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,760
REALLY?

130
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,760
YEAH.

131
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,120
AND SHE'S RUNNING AN
ELECTION AND IF YOU'VE GOT REAL

132
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,300
POWERFUL COMMUNITY LEADERS,
WHO'RE ON YOUR SIDE, YOU SHOULD

133
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,360
BE ON THEIR SIDE.

134
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,010
GO BACK HER
BECAUSE SHE WAS THERE FROM DAY

135
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,150
ONE.

136
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,300
SO GOD BLESS THE BUSINESS
LEADERS IN THE COMMUNITY LEADERS

137
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,400
WHO ARE FIGHTING BACK TO MAKE
SURE THAT YOUR VOICE IS

138
00:05:45,400 --> 00:00:00,000
REPRESENTED.
