you

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,279
well I'm kind of proud<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the markets</font>

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,350
for doing that for two reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is</font>

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learned the brexit</font>

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,920
lesson that the markets first reaction

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,900
may not be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they should they</font>

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,030
should follow I think back to the last

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">time we had kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a political shock in</font>

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. back in 2011 we had that debt</font>

10
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:21,750
ceiling debacle stocks fell sharply it

11
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,880
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> them three months for to get all</font>

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,020
the way back but those<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sold</font>

13
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,180
probably didn't get back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in again it</font>

14
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,829
with brexit it took three days for

15
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,630
markets after that dip to come back this

16
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,090
time you know three hours did it take

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,290
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> stocks to come all the way back</font>

18
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,640
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned that lesson that</font>

19
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,710
panicking can really hurt them the

20
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,239
whipsaw of the market can really catch

21
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,129
them off guard and they didn't panic

22
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,719
that's one reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm proud the other</font>

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,760
reason is that they stuck to their plan

24
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,350
they stuck to their asset allocation at

25
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,089
Schwab we did a survey both before and

26
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,760
right after the election<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday we</font>

27
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,999
asked investors at swamp how do you feel

28
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:55,379
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any changes to</font>

29
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">your portfolio and more than two-thirds</font>

30
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,699
of swamp client said<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I feel good</font>

31
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">about my portfolio how its position I</font>

32
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,199
think it can weather the volatility

33
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,000
certainly some indicated that they might

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,070
make changes but most didn't that's a

35
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,390
good sign they were prepared for

36
00:01:09,390 --> 00:00:00,000
potential volatility before it happened
