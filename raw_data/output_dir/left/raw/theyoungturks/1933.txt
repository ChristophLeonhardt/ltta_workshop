1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,919
A QUICK VIDEO
OF VALERIE PLAME RESPONDING

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:05,359
TO THIS PARDON, LET'S TAKE A
QUICK LOOK.

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,000
>>THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT ABOUT
ME, IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT ABOUT

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,530
SCOOTER LIBBY, IT'S ABOUT DONALD
TRUMP AND HIS FUTURE.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,530
IT'S VERY

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,670
CLEAR THAT THIS IS A MESSAGE
HE'S SENDING, THAT YOU CAN

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,100
COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST NATIONAL
SECURITY AND YOU WILL BE

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,100
PARDONED.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,480
SO I THINK HE'S GOT AN
AUDIENCE OF THREE RIGHT NOW,

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,920
THAT WOULD BE MANAFORT, FLYNN,
AND KUSHNER.

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,130
AND PERHAPS OTHERS.

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,270
THE MESSAGE BEING SENT IS YOU
CAN COMMIT PERJURY AND I WILL

13
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:39,610
PARDON YOU IF IT PROTECTS ME AND
I DEEM THAT YOU ARE LOYAL TO ME.

14
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,250
I THINK THE MESSAGE IS VERY
DAMAGING TO OUR DEMOCRACY

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,820
AND THE RULE OF LAW.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,970
>>AND LET'S NOT FORGET,
VALERIE PLAME WAS OUTED BECAUSE

17
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:55,010
HER HUSBAND, JOE WILSON, TALKED
ABOUT THE YELLOWCAKE AND SAID

18
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,480
THAT WE SHOULDN'T GO INTO IRAQ.

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,660
SO IT WAS A VINDICTIVE MOVE TO

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,230
LEAK HER NAME AND PUT HER LIFE
AT RISK.

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,230
SO IT ALL JUST GOES

22
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,070
BACK TO, LIKE, LISTEN, I KEEP
SAYING, OBVIOUSLY I'M ON THE

23
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,860
LEFT POLITICALLY, BUT IF SOMEONE
COMES TO ME AND GOES LOOK AT THE

24
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,030
STUFF THAT PEOPLE ON THE LEFT
DID TO OUT SOMEBODY OR TO PUT

25
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,829
SOMEONE'S LIFE IN DANGER, I'M
GOING TO ADMIT IT, I WILL GO,

26
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:17,829
YOU ARE RIGHT.

27
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:20,910
IF YOU SAY UNDER
OBAMA THERE WERE A LOT OF DRONE

28
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,910
ATTACKS, THERE WERE.

29
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:22,910
I WILL
ACCEPT THAT.

30
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:23,910
IT'S CRAZY TO ME

31
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,420
HOW ON THE RIGHT A LOT OF PEOPLE
SIT THERE AND GO, YOU KNOW WHAT,

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,310
THIS WAS A GOOD THING, THIS GUY
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING THAT BAD.

33
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,310
HE

34
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,000
PUT SOMEONE'S LIFE AT RISK WHO
WAS AN OPERATIVE AND THE ONLY

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,120
REASON WHY WAS BECAUSE OF THE
VINDICTIVENESS, THAT HE HAD THE

36
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,050
BALLS OR THE GALL TO SAY THAT
THE WAR WITH IRAQ WASN'T RIGHT.

37
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,720
>>CENK AND I TALK ABOUT THAT
ALL THE TIME, HOW ON THE LEFT WE

38
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,310
HAVE INCURRED LEHIGH STANDARDS
FOR ONE ANOTHER AND IF SOMEONE

39
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,220
DOES SOMETHING WRONG WE HAVE NO
PROBLEM CALLING THAT INDIVIDUAL

40
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,780
OUT, WHETHER IT HAS TO DO WITH
SOMEONE ACCUSED OF SEXUAL

41
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,710
MISCONDUCT OR DOING SOMETHING
ILLEGAL WHILE IN GOVERNMENT OR

42
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,970
IN OFFICE, WE ARE READY AND
WILLING TO CALL THEM OUT, AND WE

43
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,010
CALLED OUT OBAMA FOR THOSE DRONE
STRIKES OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

44
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,010
BUT

45
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,390
THE RIGHT IS SO LOYAL TO ONE
ANOTHER, THEY DON'T CARE, THEY

46
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,532
WILL STICK BY ONE ANOTHER NO
MATTER WHAT, THERE ARE NO

47
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,190
STANDARDS OR PRINCIPLES
WHATSOEVER.

48
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:20,730
>>ON MY SHOW WE HAVE SORT OF
ADOPTED THE RULE THAT WE CAN'T

49
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,280
KEEP SAYING WHAT IF OBAMA HAD
DONE THIS?

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
BECAUSE YOU KNOW

51
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
WHAT?

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,410
EVERY FREAKING DAY, WHAT
IF OBAMA HAD PAID OFF A PORN

53
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,440
STAR $130,000?

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,230
GET OUT OF HERE.

55
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,200
>>BILL, I TRY NOT TO DO IT BUT
I DID IT TWO DAYS AGO ON THE

56
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
TWEETS.

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,030
THE TWEETS ARE SO
MANIACAL, THE MCCAIN TWEET TODAY

58
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,510
WHERE HE'S SCREAMING AT THE TOP
OF HIS LUNGS LIKE A PETULANT

59
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,370
CHILD, ANY ONE OF THOSE TWEETS
FROM OBAMA WOULD HAVE LAUNCHED A

60
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,660
DOZEN CONGRESSIONAL
INVESTIGATIONS AND PROBABLY 25TH

61
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,390
AMENDMENT HEARINGS, LIKE IS THIS
MAN LOST HIS MIND?

62
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,480
>>LET ALONE THE PRESIDENT
CALLING SOMEONE A SLIMEBALL.

63
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,760
>>IT FEELS LIKE, WE HAVE SEEN
THIS WHERE THERE'S AN ABUSIVE

64
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,959
BOYFRIEND OR HUSBAND IN A
RELATIONSHIP WITH A GIRL AND YOU

65
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,520
SEE IT IN YOU'RE LIKE, WHY DON'T
YOU GET OUT OF THIS?

66
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,950
I FEEL LIKE

67
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,080
REPUBLICANS ARE THE ABUSED
GIRLFRIEND AND THIS GUY IS THE

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,750
ABUSIVE BOYFRIEND.

69
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,709
DON'T YOU SEE
HOW CRAZY THIS TWEET IS?

70
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:25,709
A TWEET

71
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,400
ABOUT MAYBE WE WILL ATTACK SYRIA
IN THE FUTURE --

72
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,940
>>MAYBE IT WILL BE SOON,
MAYBE A LONG TIME FROM NOW.

73
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,940
I'M PARAPHRASING.

74
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:40,330
>>WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S EVERY DAY
LIKE YOU SAID, 10 TWEETS A DAY.

75
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,459
REPUBLICANS THAT ARE WATCHING
THIS, PLEASE JUST LOOK AT THE

76
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:45,560
FACTS AND SIT THERE FOR A SECOND
AND GO, OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

77
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
I

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,540
STILL ADHERE TO REPUBLICAN
PRINCIPLES, BUT THIS DUDE IS NOT

79
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,970
GOOD FOR THE WORLD.

80
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,069
HE'S BAD.

81
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,450
>>BUT THE REASON THEY DON'T,
THEY KNOW THAT, LOOK AT THE

82
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,200
ANONYMOUS CONGRESSMAN WHO TALKS
TO ERICK ERICKSON THE OTHER DAY,

83
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,849
SAYING HE'S AN EVIL EFFING
FORREST GUMP, AND A DUMB ONE AT

84
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:06,849
THAT.

85
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,300
FORREST GUMP WAS MENTALLY
DAMAGED, AND HE'S WORSE THAN

86
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,300
THAT.

87
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:17,399
SO 
THEY KNOW.

88
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,878
THE PROBLEM
IS, THEIR BASE IS EITHER EQUALLY

89
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:26,569
STUPID OR JUST DOESN'T CARE THAT
HE'S MANIACALLY STUPID.

90
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:27,569
BECAUSE

91
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:29,479
THEY SEE THOSE TWEETS, IT'S NOT
LIKE PEOPLE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT

92
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:32,139
THE TWEETS, IT'S NOT LIKE THEY
CAN'T SEE THEM WITH THEIR OWN

93
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,189
EYES, THEY DO, AND THEY ALL
AGREE NOT THAT THE EMPEROR

94
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:38,360
DOESN'T HAVE CLOTHES -- HE
DOESN'T HAVE CLOTHES BUT THEY

95
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
SAY YES HE DOES.

96
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,939
THEY USED TO DO
THAT WITH GEORGE BUSH, THIS GUY

97
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:44,349
IS FINE, HE CAN PUT SENTENCES
TOGETHER.

98
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:45,349
NO HE CAN'T, IT'S

99
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:46,639
SUPER OBVIOUS.

100
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,349
IN THIS CASE THEY
HAVE AGREED THAT THE EMPEROR HAS

101
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:51,380
A MIND WHEN IT'S CLEAR THE
EMPEROR HAS NO MIND.

102
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,380
HE'S LOST

103
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,380
HIS MIND COMPLETELY.

104
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,979
AND THERE
ARE 33% OF THE COUNTRY WHO WILL

105
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,900
NOT MOVE, WHO LOOK AT A MAN WHO
IS CLEARLY MENTALLY UNBALANCED

106
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,789
AND GOES, NAILED IT.

107
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:04,990
AND WE HAVE TO RESPECT THOSE
GUYS, IT'S MADNESS.

108
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,849
>>THEY NOT ONLY TOLERATE THESE
TWEETS, THEY LOVE IT.

109
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,000
>>I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP.

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,029
>>THEY THINK THEY SENT HIM THERE
TO SHAKE THEM UP AND TAKE THEM

111
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:16,811
ALL ON, REPUBLICANS AND
DEMOCRATS, THEY ARE SICK, I

112
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:18,189
THINK, BUT THEY LOVE THEM.

113
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,729
THE
TRUEST THING DONALD TRUMP EVER

114
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:23,159
SAID WAS THAT OLD LINE ABOUT I
COULD GO OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF

115
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:26,599
FIFTH AVENUE AND SHOOT SOMEBODY
AND NOBODY WOULD DO ANYTHING.

116
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:27,680
YOU KNOW WHAT?

117
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,139
HE IS DEAD RIGHT
ON THAT.

118
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:30,139
>>HE WAS RIGHT ON THAT.

119
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:33,270
AND ALSO
YOU HAVE THE BUBBLE THAT THE

120
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,419
TRUMP BASE LIVES IN. AND WHAT I
MEAN BY THAT IS, THE TYPE OF

121
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,879
NEWS CONTENT THEY CONSUME.

122
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,309
SO
THE NEWS CONTENT THEY CONSUME

123
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:44,839
JUSTIFIES THE TYPES OF TWEETS HE
PUTS OUT THERE, BECAUSE HE

124
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:48,949
PRESENTS HIMSELF AS A VICTIM,
SOMEONE WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF A

125
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,879
WITCHHUNT, AND THEN ALL YOU HEAR
ON FOX NEWS AND BREITBART AND

126
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,270
ALL THESE OTHER "MEDIA
ORGANIZATIONS" IS THAT HE'S A

127
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,379
VICTIM HERE, SO THEY LOVE THE
TWEETS, THEY THINK HE'S TELLING

128
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:03,849
IT LIKE IT IS AND CALLING PEOPLE
OUT AND BEING A TOUGH GUY.

129
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:06,319
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW THE
REALITY OF WHAT'S GOING ON

130
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,319
BEHIND THE SCENES.

131
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,569
>>HE SAID DRAIN THE SWAMP, FIGHT
THE ESTABLISHMENT, A LOT OF HIS

132
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:12,740
FOLLOWERS THINK HE'S PUTTING THE
ESTABLISHMENT WHERE THEY NEED TO

133
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,969
BE, BUT HERE IS SCOOTER LIBBY,
PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT, PART

134
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:19,330
OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HE
CRITICIZED, HE SAYS I WAS

135
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,699
AGAINST THE IRAQ WAR, EVEN
THOUGH HE SAID ON HOWARD STERN

136
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:28,430
HE WAS FOR IT, NOW HE HAS
PARDONED A GUY WHO WAS INVOLVED

137
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:36,279
WITH OUTING SOMEONE BECAUSE OF
THEIR OPPOSITION 

138
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:50,349
TO 

139
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:51,349
THE IRAQ

140
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:52,349
WAR.

141
00:06:52,349 --> 00:00:00,000
IT MAKES NO SENSE.
