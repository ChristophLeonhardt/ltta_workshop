1
00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:02,402
ALLEGATIONS. 

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:05,405
AN INVESTIGATION WHICH WAS THEN 

3
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:06,539
SEVERELY CIRCUMSCRIBED BY THE 

4
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:09,509
WHITE HOUSE. 

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,844
OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS BLAME US 

6
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,645
FOR THIS PROCESS, THEY ARE 

7
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:14,881
ALWAYS FINDING A STRAW MAN, BUT 

8
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:17,117
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM 

9
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,751
THE TRUTH, FIRST, THEY BLAME US 

10
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:21,821
FOR DELAY, KNOWING FULL WELL 

11
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,289
THAT MAJORITY LEADER MITCH 

12
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,859
McCONNELL HAS COMPLETE CONTROL 

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,594
OF WHEN NOMINEES ARE BROUGHT TO 

14
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,562
THE FLOOR. 

15
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,230
LEADER MITCH McCONNELL COULD 

16
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,332
HAVE MOVED THE NOMINEE TWO 

17
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,435
WEEKS AGO OR ONE WEEK AGO. 

18
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:39,272
DEMOCRATS HAD NO SAY, AND DON'T,

19
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:42,542
WHEN IT COMES TO WHO COMES TO 

20
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,779
THE FLOOR, BUT IN EACH CASE, 

21
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,447
LEADER McCONNELL COULDN'T MOVE 

22
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,214
HIM FORWARD BECAUSE HE WAS 

23
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,482
BLOCKED BY FELLOW REPUBLICANS, 

24
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:53,453
NOT DEMOCRATS, FROM MOVING 

25
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:53,920
FORWARD. 

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,754
WHEN IT COMES TO COMPLAINING 

27
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,490
ABOUT THE LAKE, TWO WORDS NEVER 

28
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,925
COME FROM OUR REPUBLICAN 

29
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:06,566
FRIENDS LIPS, MERRICK GARLAND. 

30
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,233
REPUBLICANS ARE ALSO SAYING WE 

31
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,968
ENGAGED IN A SMEAR CAMPAIGN, 

32
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:13,873
WHERE THE POLITICS OF PERSONAL 

33
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:20,547
DESTRUCTION WERE WITH THIS 

34
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:21,214
NOMINATION, IN REALITY, THEY 

35
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,215
ARE USING DEMOCRATS AS A STRAW 

36
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:22,782
MAN, WHAT THEY'RE REALLY 

37
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,484
TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT DR. FORD 

38
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,886
SAID.  

39
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,021
DEMOCRATS DID NOT INDUCE HER TO 

40
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,789
COME FORWARD, HER CONSCIENCE 

41
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,858
DID. 

42
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,392
AND ARE RECUT -- REPUBLICAN 

43
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:44,604
FRIENDS, ACCUSING TREVOR SEVEN 

44
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,705
AND HER DEEPLY HELD MEMORIES OF 

45
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:46,872
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER OF A SMEAR 

46
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:49,742
CAMPAIGN, ARE THE ACCUSING DR. 

47
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:50,844
FORD OF A SMEAR CAMPAIGN, OF 

48
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:51,678
ENGAGING IN THE POLITICS OF 

49
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:52,745
PERSONAL DESTRUCTION?  

50
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,280
BECAUSE THAT IS WHO THEY ARE 

51
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,348
ACTUALLY BLAMING, THEY ARE 

52
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,183
DECRYING HER TESTIMONY, AND 

53
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:01,521
THEN TRYING TO BLAME DEMOCRATS. 

54
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,256
I DON'T BLAME THEM, THEY HAVE A 

55
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,591
FLAWED NOMINEE, THEY DON'T WANT 

56
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:08,595
TO FOCUS ON THE NOMINEE.

57
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:09,795
>>> WHEN FUTURE AMERICANS LOOK 

58
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,364
BACK AT THESE PROCEEDINGS, LET 

59
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,800
THEM DRAW NO LESSONS FROM THE 

60
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:22,408
SENATE'S CONDUCT HERE. 

61
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,342
LET THEM LOOK BACK ON THIS 

62
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:24,077
CHAPTER AS THE SHAMEFUL 

63
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:24,710
CULMINATION OF THE SCORCHED 

64
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,112
EARTH POLITICS PRACTICED BY THE 

65
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:26,745
HARD RIGHT IN AMERICA. 

66
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:28,881
PEOPLE WHO WILL STOP AT NOTHING 

67
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:32,318
TO ENTRENCH AN ADVANTAGE ON OUR 

68
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,587
NATIONS COURTS. 

69
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:35,187
LET THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS 

70
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:37,890
FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH BE RECORDED 

71
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,227
AS A SORRY EPILOGUE TO THE 

72
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:44,163
BRAZEN THEFT OF JUSTICE 

73
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:49,569
SCALIA'S SEAT, THE IGNOMINIOUS 

74
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,171
END OF BIPARTISAN COOPERATION 

75
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,538
AND CONSULTATION ON THE 

76
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:55,041
CONFIRMATION OF SUPREME COURT 

77
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:55,708
JUSTICES. 

78
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,377
AND FOR WHAT? 

79
00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:00,513
FOR WHOM ARE SENATE REPUBLICAN 

80
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,247
LEADERS WILLING TO DISCUSS ALL 

81
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:04,617
SEMBLANCE -- DISCARD ALL 

82
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:05,885
SEMBLANCE OF FAIRNESS TO 

83
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:09,856
CONFIRM? 

84
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,523
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, CERTAINLY THE 

85
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:14,427
PRODUCT OF AN ELITE EDUCATION, 

86
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:15,828
BUT ALSO SOMEONE WITH HARD 

87
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:16,261
RIGHT, CONSERVATIVE 

88
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:17,963
JURISPRUDENCE, FAR AWAY FROM 

89
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:23,502
WHAT AVERAGE AMERICANS BELIEVE. 

90
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:24,470
WHY MOST DEMOCRATS OPPOSED HIS 

91
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,106
NOMINATION AT THE OUTSET FEELS 

92
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:27,874
LIKE ANCIENT HISTORY NOW, BUT 

93
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:32,244
LET US NOT FORGET THAT MOST 

94
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:32,879
IMPORTANTLY, WE STRONGLY 

95
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,579
DISAGREED WITH A NUMBER OF 

96
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:39,118
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S VIEWS, HE IS 

97
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,353
DEEPLY SKEPTICAL OF 

98
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,454
UNENUMERATED RIGHTS, INCLUDING 

99
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,958
A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE 

100
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:45,491
FUNDAMENTAL THE PRIVATE 

101
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,692
DECISIONS ABOUT HER MEDICAL 

102
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:48,027
CARE. 

103
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,128
HE IS DEEPLY SKEPTICAL OF THE 

104
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,230
GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN PROTECTING 

105
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,832
AMERICANS WITH PRE-EXISTING 

106
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,768
CONDITIONS. 

107
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,571
HE IS DEEPLY SKEPTICAL OF NEARLY

108
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,874
ALL RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT 

109
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,777
PROTECT CONSUMERS, WORKERS, AND 

110
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,647
THE ENVIRONMENT. 

111
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:08,948
AND THE FLASHING RED LIGHT 

112
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,684
WARNING SIGN AT THE CENTER OF 

113
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,319
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S JURISPRUDENCE 

114
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,620
ARE HIS VIEWS ON EXECUTIVE 

115
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:20,759
POWER AND ACCOUNTABILITY. 

116
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,327
SOMEHOW, THIS CONSERVATIVE 

117
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,262
JUDGE AND SCHOLAR OF THE 

118
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,364
CONSTITUTION, SEES AT THE HEART 

119
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,431
OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY A 

120
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:35,275
PRESIDENT  KING, AN EXECUTIVE 

121
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:44,550
WHO WHILE IN OFFICE, SHOULD BE 

122
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,451
BEYOND THE REACH OF SUBPOENAS 

123
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,753
IN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS, OR 

124
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,921
CIVIL INVESTIGATIONS. 

125
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:49,722
THIS MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY 

126
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:53,159
DEMANDS DEEP SKEPTICISM ABOUT 

127
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,060
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S VIEW ON 

128
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,693
EXECUTIVE POWER, NOMINATED AS 

129
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:58,731
HE WAS BY AN EXECUTIVE THAT 

130
00:04:58,731 --> 00:04:59,598
DISDAINS THE CONSTRAINTS OF HIS 

131
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:00,800
OFFICE, AND WHO IS AT THIS VERY 

132
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,135
MOMENT THE APPARENT SUBJECT OF 

133
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:07,740
INVESTIGATIONS HIS SUPREME 

134
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,508
COURT NOMINEE SHOULD BE INVALID 

135
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:12,512
-- BELIEVES SHOULD BE 

136
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:16,515
INVALID.>>> I MET WITH JUDGE 

137
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:17,382
KAVANAUGH FOR ALMOST 2 HOURS, 

138
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:22,255
AND I ASKED HIM ABOUT THOSE 

139
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:22,955
ISSUES, HIS ANSWERS WERE 

140
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,057
CONSTANTLY EVASIVE AND UTTERLY 

141
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:24,424
UNSATISFACTORY. 

142
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:28,694
IT WAS DCC VU ALL OVER AGAIN 

143
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:30,363
IN THE FIRST ROUND OF HEARINGS, 

144
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,865
WHEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

145
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:33,465
DELIBERATELY AVOIDED TALKING 

146
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:36,235
ABOUT HIS VIEWS ON ROE V WADE, 

147
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:36,768
HEALTHCARE, PRESIDENTIAL 

148
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:40,773
ACCOUNTABILITY AND MORE. 

149
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:41,674
THERE WAS NO LEGAL REASON, A 

150
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,510
RULER LOGIC THAT PREVENTED HIM 

151
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,381
-- RULE OR LOGIC THAT PREVENTED 

152
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,184
HIM FROM TELLING US WHAT HE 

153
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,186
THOUGHT, HE WAS EVASIVE, 

154
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,387
BECAUSE HE KNOWS HIS VIEWS ARE 

155
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,621
DEEPLY AT ODDS WITH THE 

156
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,825
PROGRESS AMERICA HAS MADE OVER 

157
00:05:58,825 --> 00:05:59,791
THE LAST CENTURY OF 

158
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,627
JURISPRUDENCE. 

159
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:05,832
AND AT ODDS WITH WHAT MOST 

160
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,267
AMERICANS BELIEVE. 

161
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,335
HIS PERFORMANCE WAS NOT ONLY 

162
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:13,940
UNFAIR AND FRUSTRATING TO THE 

163
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,141
SENATE, IT WAS UNFAIR TO THE 

164
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,843
AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHEN A NOMINEE 

165
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,145
REFUSES TO DISCLOSE THEIR VIEWS,

166
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,247
CHANCES ARE YOU HAVE A NOMINEE 

167
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,250
WHOSE VIEWS ARE FAR OUTSIDE THE 

168
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,085
MAINSTREAM OF AMERICA. 

169
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,689
WEATHER THEY BE FAR RIGHT OR 

170
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:33,893
FAR LEFT. 

171
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,994
COLLIES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 

172
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,295
THE AISLE MAY NOT HAVE AS GREAT 

173
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:37,230
A CONCERN ABOUT THESE VIEWS AS 

174
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,430
WE DO, BUT LET NO AMERICAN BE 

175
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,400
SURPRISE IF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

176
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,803
BECOMES A DECISIVE VOTE TO 

177
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:44,704
RESTRICT THE RIGHTS AND 

178
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,073
PRIVILEGES OF THE AMERICAN 

179
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,508
PEOPLE, WHILE STRETCHING THE 

180
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,543
BOUNDS OF PRIVILEGE FOR THE 

181
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,012
CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE 

182
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:53,779
HOUSE. 

183
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:54,647
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION 

184
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:58,717
ULTIMATELY DOES NOT ONLY 

185
00:06:58,717 --> 00:06:59,952
ENCOMPASS QUESTIONS OF IDEOLOGY 

186
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,555
OR CREDENTIALS, BUT QUESTIONS 

187
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,057
OF CHARACTER. 

188
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,258
HERE AGAIN, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

189
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:10,563
FALLS WOEFULLY SHORT OF WHAT 

190
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:11,397
AMERICANS EXPECT AND DESERVE IN 

191
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,999
A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. 

192
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,935
HE HAS REPEATEDLY MISLED THE 

193
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,404
SENATE ABOUT HIS INVOLVEMENT IN 

194
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:19,805
SOME OF THE MOST SERIOUS 

195
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:21,874
CONTROVERSIES OF THE BUSH 

196
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,677
ADMINISTRATION, INCLUDING 

197
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:25,545
WARRANTLESS WIRETAPPING OF 

198
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,446
AMERICAN CITIZENS, OUR POLICY 

199
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:34,186
AGAINST TORTURE, THE THEFT OF 

200
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:34,719
RECORDS FROM DEMOCRATIC 

201
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:35,320
SENATORS, AND HIS INVOLVEMENT 

202
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,756
IN THE NOMINATION OF VERY 

203
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:37,857
CONTROVERSIAL JUDGES. 

204
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:38,557
FACED WITH CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS 

205
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:41,627
OF VARIOUS TYPES OF MISCONDUCT, 

206
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,227
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S CREDIBILITY 

207
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:44,697
WAS AGAIN TESTED, AND HE 

208
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,599
CONTINUED TO DISSEMBLE AND EVEN 

209
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:50,102
PREVARICATE ABOUT EASILY 

210
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,772
REFUTED FACTS, BEYOND THE ISSUE 

211
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:53,706
OF CREDIT BUILDING, HE 

212
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,307
PRESENTED TO THE SENATE THE 

213
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:57,877
BITTEREST PARTISAN TESTIMONY I 

214
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,946
HAVE EVER HEARD COMING FROM A 

215
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:03,014
CANDIDATE SEEKING THE SENATE'S 

216
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:05,885
APPROVAL. 

217
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:06,953
WHETHER THEY BE FOR THE BENCH, 

218
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,122
OR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. 

219
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,657
>>> THERE ARE MANY WHO THINK 

220
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,360
THAT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN JUDGE 

221
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,362
KAVANAUGH WAS 17 YEARS OLD 

222
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,330
SHOULD NOT BE DISPOSITIVE. 

223
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,802
EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE THAT, HIS 

224
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:23,970
ACTIONS AT THE AGE OF 53 IN 

225
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,839
TERMS OF DEMEANOR, PARTISANSHIP,

226
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,375
AND ABOVE ALL, CREDIBILITY, 

227
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:35,948
SHOULD BE DISPOSITIVE. 

228
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:36,816
JUDGES AT EVERY LEVEL OF THE 

229
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:37,850
FEDERAL BENCH SHOULD BE HELD TO 

230
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,751
THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF ETHICS 

231
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,652
AND MORAL CHARACTER, JUDGES AT 

232
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:43,355
EVERY LEVEL SHOULD BE JUDICIOUS 

233
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,791
AND CREDIBLE, AND INDEPENDENT, 

234
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,527
BUT ESPECIALLY, ON THE SUPREME 

235
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:52,398
COURT. 

236
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,498
I DO NOT SEE HOW IT IS POSSIBLE 

237
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:54,533
FOR MY COLLEAGUES TO SAY WITH 

238
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,434
PERFECT CONFIDENCE THAT JUDGE 

239
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,503
KAVANAUGH HAS THE TEMPERAMENT, 

240
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:01,874
INDEPENDENCE, AND CREDIBILITY 

241
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,376
TO SERVE ON THE UNITED STATES 

242
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:08,014
SUPREME COURT.

243
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,382
>>> SO I ASKED MY COLLEAGUES ON 

244
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,950
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, 

245
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,151
WHY JUDGE KAVANAUGH? 

246
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,821
THERE IS NO DICTATE THAT YOU 

247
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:16,521
HAVE TO MARCH BLINDLY FORWARD 

248
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:18,123
WITH A NOMINEE, WHEN THERE ARE 

249
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:19,258
OTHERS AVAILABLE TO YOU. 

250
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:23,162
THERE ARE MANY JUDGES WHO I AM 

251
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,196
SURE CONSERVATIVES WOULD BE 

252
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,165
HAPPY TO HAVE ON THE COURT. 

253
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,967
I WOULD REMIND MY COLLEAGUES, 

254
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,769
THE SEAT THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 

255
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:37,143
ASPIRES TO FILL WAS HELD BY 

256
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:37,877
JUSTICE WHO ASSUMED THE BENCH 

257
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:38,711
AFTER ONE NOMINEE WAS VOTED 

258
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:39,712
DOWN BY THE SENATE, AND A 

259
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:40,879
SECOND NOMINEE WITHDREW HIS 

260
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,881
NOMINATION. 

261
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,017
BUT THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY HAS 

262
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,119
PRESSED FORWARD BLINDLY ON 

263
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:50,556
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, EVEN WHEN 

264
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:51,557
BRAVE WOMEN CAME FORWARD TO 

265
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:52,624
SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER. 

266
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:54,527
WHY? 

267
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,762
FOR WHAT CAUSE? 

268
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,098
FOR THE SAKE OF WINNING? 

269
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,701
THAT IS NOT REASON ENOUGH. 

270
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,369
MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE,

271
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:07,940
IF YOU HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT JUDGE 

272
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,607
KAVANAUGH'S CREDIBILITY, ABOUT 

273
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:11,310
HIS ABILITY TO TELL THE TRUTH, 

274
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,511
ABOUT HIS ABILITY TO BE 

275
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,147
IMPARTIAL AND NONPARTISAN, NO 

276
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,682
MATTER WHAT YOU THINK OF HIS 

277
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,151
JURISPRUDENCE, OR WHAT HE MAY 

278
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,286
OR MAY NOT OF DONE IN HIGH 

279
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,754
SCHOOL AND COLLEGE, YOU SHOULD 

280
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,024
NOT VOTE TO CONFIRM HIM TO THE 

281
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,726
SUPREME COURT.

282
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:30,529
>>> SO MY FRIENDS, DEMOCRAT AND 

283
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,466
REPUBLICAN, FOR ALL THE 

284
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,867
CONTROVERSY, ALL THE HEAVY HAD 

285
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:38,537
MRS. -- HEAVY HANDEDNESS, THE 

286
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:39,805
VILIFICATION OF BOTH SIDES, 

287
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,740
THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE THAT THE 

288
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,479
SENATE CAN SAVE ITSELF. 

289
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,248
WE CAN SALVAGE SOME DECENCY 

290
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:53,786
HERE AT THE END. IF JUDGE 

291
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,521
KAVANAUGH IS REJECTED, 

292
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,989
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL SELECT 

293
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,357
ANOTHER NOMINEE, LIKELY RIGHT 

294
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:01,427
OF CENTER, PROBABLY NOT TO MY 

295
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,496
LIKING, BUT WITHOUT THE CLOUD 

296
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:08,501
THAT HANGS OVER THIS NOMINEE. 

297
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,501
AND WE CAN PROCEED TO CONSIDER 

298
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,303
THAT NOMINEE IN A MUCH LESS 

299
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,839
BITTER, MUCH BETTER, LESS 

300
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,875
PARTISAN WAY. 

301
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,975
A BIPARTISAN MAJORITY OF 

302
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:19,512
SENATORS CONSIDERING FULLY THE 

303
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,548
WEIGHT OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

304
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,418
TESTIMONY, RECORD, CREDIBILITY, 

305
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:25,885
TRUSTWORTHINESS, AND 

306
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,789
TEMPERAMENT, CONSIDERING FULLY 

307
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:34,827
THE HEARTBREAKING TESTIMONY OF 

308
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:35,661
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, CAN VOTE 

309
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,262
TO REJECT  JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

310
00:11:37,262 --> 00:11:39,465
NOMINATION AND ASKED THE 

311
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:43,469
PRESIDENT TO SEND THE SENATE 

312
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,238
ANOTHER NAME. 

313
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:49,642
FOR THE SAKE OF THE SENATE, OF 

314
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:53,879
THE SUPREME COURT, AND OF 

315
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,249
AMERICA, I HOPE, I PRAY, MY 

316
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,553
COLLEAGUES WILL DO SO. 

317
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:11,964
>>> ALL RIGHT, WE'VE BEEN 

318
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:12,765
LISTENING TO CHUCK SCHUMER, 

319
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:13,399
BEFORE HIM DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 

320
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,403
AND BEFORE THAT, CHUCK GRASSLEY,

SENATORS REITERATING THEIR 

322
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,371
ARGUMENTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN 

323
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,539
HEARING OUT IN THE HALLWAY, IN 

324
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:26,378
SCRUMS WITH JOURNALISTS, ABOUT 

325
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,780
BRETT KAVANAUGH, BUT WHAT IS 

326
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:32,551
INTERESTING, IS THERE DESK THEY 

327
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,786
ARE GOING BACK TO THE MACHINE. 

328
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,087
MAYBE WE WON'T, WE WILL LISTEN 

329
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,621
TO WHAT MITCH McCONNELL HAS TO 

330
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:37,890
SAY.

331
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:44,530
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS A NOMINEE 

332
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,265
OF THE VERY HIGHEST CALIBER. 

333
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,902
A BRILLIANT LEGAL MIND, AN

00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:53,873
ACCOMPLISHED JURIST, WITH A 

335
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,876
PROVEN DEVOTION TO THE RULE OF

LAW. 

337
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,244
TODAY, THE SENATE HAS THE 

338
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,244
OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE HIS

NOMINATION, EVERY ONE OF US 

340
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,850
WILL GO ON RECORD WITH ONE OF 

341
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,018
THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL VOTES 

342
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:12,358
YOU EVER CAST IN THE SENATE.

343
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,459
>>> NOW, THE STAKES ARE ALWAYS 

344
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,828
HIGH FOR A SUPREME COURT 

345
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:16,729
NOMINATION, BUT COLLEAGUES, THE 

346
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:17,529
EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS OF RECENT 

347
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:24,570
WEEKS HAVE RAISED AN EVEN 

348
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,437
HIGHER STICK THIS TIME. 

349
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,472
WHEN WE VOTE THIS MORNING, WE 

350
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,007
WILL NOT ONLY BE DECIDING 

351
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,176
WHETHER TO ELEVATE A STUNNINGLY

WELL-QUALIFIED JUDGE SURE 

353
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,514
HIGHEST COURT, NOT ANYMORE, NOT 

354
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,616
AFTER ALL THIS. 

355
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,251
UNITED STATES SENATE WILL ALSO 

356
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:45,891
BE MAKING A STATEMENT. 

357
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,527
WITH PARTISAN POLITICS, CAN IT 

358
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:52,198
OVERRIDE, OR REAFFIRM THAT THE 

359
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,265
NICETIES OF AMERICA, EVERYONE 

360
00:13:53,265 --> 00:14:01,707
IS INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.

361
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,008
WE WILL EITHER STATE THAT FACTS 

362
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:03,642
AND EVIDENCE CAN SIMPLY BE 

363
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:04,843
BRUSHED ASIDE WHEN POLITICALLY 

364
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:08,714
INCONVENIENT, AND SIGNAL THAT 

365
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,483
MEDIA BULLYING AND MOB 

366
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,886
INTIMIDATION ARE VALID TACTICS 

367
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:17,856
FOR SHAPING THE SENATE. 

368
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:21,393
THE MOB CAN ATTACK, AND THE 

369
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:25,965
SENATE CAVES. 

370
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,199
OR WE WILL STAND UP AND SAY 

371
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,333
THAT SERIOUS, THOUGHTFUL, FACT-

372
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:32,004
BASED DELIBERATION WILL STILL 

373
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:35,207
DEFINE THIS BODY. 

374
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,844
WE WILL GIVE NOTICE, THAT 

375
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:39,344
TOTALLY UNCORROBORATED 

376
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:41,780
ALLEGATIONS ARE NOW OFFICIALLY 

377
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,117
ENOUGH TO DESTROY AN AMERICAN'S 

378
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:49,388
LIFE. 

379
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,422
OR WE WILL DECLARE THAT OUR 

380
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,590
SOCIETY CANNOT AND MUST NOT, 

381
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:58,764
WILL NOT, SET THE BAR SO LOW.

382
00:14:58,764 --> 00:14:59,531
>>> SO MADAM PRESIDENT, TODAY 

383
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,566
IS A PIVOTAL DAY IN THE 

384
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,767
NOMINATION PROCESS OF THIS 

385
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:05,437
EXCELLENT JUDGE. 

386
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,872
BUT IT IS A PIVOTAL DAY FOR US 

387
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,775
HERE IN THE SENATE AS WELL. 

388
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:10,843
THE IDEALS OF JUSTICE THAT HAVE 

389
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,444
SERVED OUR NATION SO WELL FOR 

390
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:17,082
SO LONG, ARE ON FULL DISPLAY.

391
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:21,319
>>> SO LET'S STEP BACK AND 

392
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:22,388
SAMPLE A FEW OF THE CHOICE 

393
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,422
MOMENTS THAT THE SENATE AND THE 

394
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,356
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 

395
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,691
TREATED TO DURING THE 

396
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,659
ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL SPECTACLE

397
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,828
OF THE LAST TWO WEEKS. 

398
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,398
THE VERY NIGHT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

399
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:36,135
WAS ANNOUNCED AS THE PRESENCE 

400
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:40,706
CHOICE, WE HEARD THE JUNIOR 

401
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:41,606
SENATOR FROM OREGON SAY THAT 

402
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:42,574
THIS NOMINEE WOULD PAVE THE WAY 

403
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:43,509
TO TYRANNY. 

404
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,544
HIS AUDIENCE? 

405
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:46,945
CROWDS OF FAR LEFT PROTESTERS, 

406
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:52,384
STILL FILLING IN THE BLANKS ON 

407
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,118
THE PICKET SIGNS, THEY WEREN'T 

408
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,119
SURE WHO THE NOMINEE WAS GOING 

409
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:54,787
TO BE AT. 

410
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,722
-- BE YET. 

411
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,658
THE SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY, 

412
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,693
DESCRIBING IT AS A GREAT MORAL 

413
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:02,094
STRUGGLE. 

414
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:05,230
IN WHICH THERE ARE JUST 2 CAMPS.

415
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,801
YOU ARE EITHER COMPLICIT IN THE 

416
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,536
EVIL, OR YOU ARE FIGHTING 

417
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,072
AGAINST IT. 

418
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:18,811
MORE RECENTLY, WE'VE HEARD THE 

419
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,378
JUNIOR SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

420
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:19,912
ARGUE THAT HER PERSONAL 

421
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,046
DISAGREEMENT WITH JUDGE 

422
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,215
KAVANAUGH'S JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY 

423
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,118
MEANT, LISTEN TO THIS, HE 

424
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,086
DESERVED LESS OF A PRESUMPTION 

425
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,755
OF INNOCENCE WHEN IT CAME TO 

426
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:33,192
ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT. 

427
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,793
IF YOU DISAGREE WITH HER, YOU 

428
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:35,727
ARE NOT ENTITLED TO THE 

429
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:38,730
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE WHEN 

430
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,032
IT COMES TO ALLEGATIONS OF 

431
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,133
MISCONDUCT. 

432
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,069
THAT IS A MEMBER OF THE 

433
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,838
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE? 

434
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,338
THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF DUE 

435
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:49,408
PROCESS? 

436
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,844
APPARENTLY, YOU GET DUE PROCESS 

437
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,814
ONLY IF YOU AGREE WITH HER. 

438
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:56,915
AND EVEN MORE RECENTLY, WE SAW 

439
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:57,782
THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM RHODE 

440
00:16:57,782 --> 00:17:02,688
ISLAND HOLD FORTH WITH GREAT 

441
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,789
CONFIDENCE, OFFERING HIS EXPERT 

442
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,324
INTERPRETATIONS OF GOOFY JOKES 

443
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,425
AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOKS FROM 

444
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,961
THE EARLY 1980S. 

445
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,028
THAT WAS INCREDIBLY 

446
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:12,598
ENLIGHTENING. 

447
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,767
INNOCENT JOKES, BEER DRINKING 

448
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,770
REFERENCES, OH NO, OUR 

449
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,771
COLLEAGUE WAS QUITE POSITIVE 

450
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:21,940
THAT THERE MUST BE A HIDDEN OR 

451
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,910
SINISTER MEANING AT PLAY. 

452
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,545
UNTIL OF COURSE A NUMBER OF 

453
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,579
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S CLASSMATES 

454
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,481
SET HIM STRAIGHT EARLIER THIS 

455
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,782
WEEK.

456
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:34,453
>>> SO STOP AND CONSIDER THESE 

457
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:40,659
SNAPSHOTS, THE ABSURDITY, THE 

458
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:45,898
INDIGNITY, THIS IS OUR APPROACH 

459
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,733
TO CONFIRMING A SUPREME COURT 

460
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,203
JUSTICE? 

461
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,772
THIS IS THE SENATE'S 

462
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,075
CONTRIBUTION TO PUBLIC DISCOURSE

463
00:17:57,075 --> 00:18:02,881
? BEFORE THE INK HAD DRIED ON 

464
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,784
JUSTICE KENNEDY'S RETIREMENT, 

465
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:12,491
OUR OPPONENTS SAID WITH THIS 

466
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,225
WOULD BE ABOUT, DELAY, 

467
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,493
OBSTRUCT,RESIST, BEFORE THE 

468
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:23,235
INK DRIED, ON THE NOMINATION, 

469
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:23,936
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE 

470
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,503
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, WERE 

471
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,270
RACING TO ANNOUNCE THEY HAD 

472
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,305
MADE UP THEIR MINDS AND TOTALLY 

473
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,172
OPPOSED TO HIS CONFIRMATION. 

474
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:27,839
MERE HOURS AFTER JUDGE 

475
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,977
KAVANAUGH WAS NOMINATED, MY 

476
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:35,414
FRIEND, THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER, 

477
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,381
SAID I WILL OPPOSE THEM WITH 

478
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,183
EVERYTHING I'VE GOT, HOURS 

479
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:41,186
BEFORE HE WAS NOMINATED, IT WAS 

480
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:41,753
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT HIS 

481
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:45,223
NUMBER 1 GOAL WAS TO DEFEAT THE 

482
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:46,358
NOMINATION BY ANY MEANS 

483
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:50,228
NECESSARY. 

484
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:51,230
IT WAS RIGHT THERE FROM THE 

485
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,632
BEGINNING, MADAM PRESIDENT, A 

486
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,400
CLEAR DECLARATION, PLAIN AS DAY,

487
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,172
NOTHING COULD GET MOST DEMOCRATS

488
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,540
TO CONSIDER THIS NOMINEE WITH 

489
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,073
AN OPEN MIND. 

490
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:05,677
IT WOULD BE DELAYED ATTACK IS --

491
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,147
TACTICS, OBSTRUCTION AND SO-

492
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:09,747
CALLED RESISTANCE UNTIL THE 

493
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:12,618
FINAL VOTE WAS CALLED.

494
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:17,222
>>> FOR A FEW WEEKS, THEIR 

495
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,490
EFFORTS PLAYED OUT ALONG LINES 

496
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,259
THAT UNFORTUNATELY HAVE BECOME 

497
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:23,495
SOMEWHAT ORDINARY AROUND HERE, 

498
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,563
EXCUSES FOR DELAY, THOSE FELL 

499
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:27,432
FLAT, THERE WERE GROSS 

500
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,567
DISTORTIONS OF JUDGE 

501
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,970
KAVANAUGH'S RECORD THAT WERE 

502
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,605
BATTED DOWN BY OUTSIDE FACT 

503
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,240
CHECKERS, AND THE USUAL PHONY 

504
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,642
APOCALYPTIC PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT 

505
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,644
ARE SHOUTED WHENEVER A 

506
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:42,981
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT THERE IS TO

507
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,616
NOMINATE A SUPREME COURT 

508
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,351
JUSTICE, HAPPENS EVERY TIME. 

509
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,486
HOSTILE TO WOMEN, VULNERABLE 

510
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:52,391
PEOPLE, WORKERS, SAME OLD 

511
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,961
TRICKS, SAME OLD PLAYBOOK. 

512
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,629
HERE WAS THE PROBLEM, THE OLD 

513
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,599
PLAYS WEREN'T WORKING. 

514
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,533
THE DISTORTIONS WERE BEING 

515
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,700
LITERALLY DROWNED OUT BY THE 

516
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,371
FACTS. 

517
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:10,609
SENATORS RECEIVED AND REVIEWED 

518
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,410
MORE PAGES OF BACKGROUND 

519
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,044
MATERIALS ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

520
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,147
NOMINATION THEN FOR EVERY 

521
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,783
PREVIOUS SUPREME COURT 

522
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,618
NOMINATION COMBINED. 

523
00:20:20,618 --> 00:20:22,054
WE READ HIS 12 YEAR RECORD OF 

524
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:22,587
JUDICIAL RULINGS FROM OUR 

525
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:23,822
NATION'S SECOND HIGHEST COURT, 

526
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:28,160
300+ OPINIONS. 

527
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,161
WE HEARD SWORN TESTIMONY, 

528
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:29,828
WRITTEN ACCOUNTS FROM HUNDREDS 

529
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:30,929
OF CHARACTER WITNESSES, FROM 

530
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,799
ALL STAGES OF HIS LIFE AND 

531
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:34,700
CAREER. 

532
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,201
AND A PICTURE PAINTED BY THESE 

533
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,903
FACTS, WAS NOTHING LIKE THE 

534
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,838
CARICATURE. 

535
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:46,411
NOTHING LIKE THE CARICATURE. 

536
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,212
SO IT WAS CLEAR, MADAM 

537
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,146
PRESIDENT, THAT THE OLD TACTICS 

538
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:48,980
WEREN'T WORKING, WERE GOING TO 

539
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,715
GET THE JOB DONE. 

540
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:53,485
THE RESISTANCE DEMANDED MORE. 

541
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:56,988
TRY SOMETHING NEW THEY SAID. 

542
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:58,456
WELL WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED 

543
00:20:58,456 --> 00:20:59,324
NEXT. 

544
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,860
UNCORROBORATED ALLEGATIONS OF 

545
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,364
THE MOST SENSITIVE, MOST SERIOUS

546
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,798
SORT WERE SHARPENED INTO 

547
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,167
POLITICAL WEAPONS. 

548
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:14,106
ONE SUCH ALLEGATION SHARED BY 

549
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,073
DR. FORD IN CONFIDENCE WITH THE 

550
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:15,840
DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THE 

551
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,876
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,  SOMEHOW 

552
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:21,780
MYSTERIOUSLY FOUND ITS WAY INTO 

553
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,750
THE PRESS. 

554
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,987
WELL, CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY FOCUSED 

555
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:35,360
ON A SOBER SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH,

556
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,027
COLLECTING TESTIMONY, ORGANIZED 

557
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:37,162
A NEW HEARING, AND ASKED FOR A 

558
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,229
SUPPLEMENTAL FBI BACKGROUND 

559
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:41,700
INVESTIGATION, JUDGE 

560
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,734
KAVANAUGH'S SEVENTH FBI 

561
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:46,705
INVESTIGATION.

562
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,807
>>> BY ANY FAIR STANDARD, THE 

563
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,476
ACTUAL FACTS, PROVED TO BE 

564
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,513
STRAIGHTFORWARD. 

565
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,548
NO CORROBORATING EVIDENCE, NONE,

566
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,650
NONE. 

567
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:03,088
WAS PRODUCED TO SUPPORT ANY OF 

568
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,791
THE ALLEGATIONS LEVELED AGAINST 

569
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,491
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

570
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,158
NO CORROBORATING EVIDENCE FROM 

571
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,494
THE FBI INQUIRY, OR FROM 

572
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:15,500
ANYWHERE ELSE, NOTHING. 

573
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,935
THAT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR OUR 

574
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,904
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES, THE 

575
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:19,938
FACTS WERE NOT THE POINT, WE 

576
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:24,409
SORT OF FORGET BY NOW, WHEN THE 

577
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,177
VERY FBI INVESTIGATION FOR 

578
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:25,777
WHICH THEY WERE CLAMORING 

579
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:28,347
TURNED UP NO NEW EVIDENCE, THE 

580
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,548
DEMOCRATS MOVED THE GOALPOSTS 

581
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:34,820
YET AGAIN.

582
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,954
>>> I BELIEVE THE LATEST STORY 

583
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,321
IS THAT THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION 

584
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:41,193
IS INVALID, BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS 

585
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,093
WHO HAD ONLY RECENTLY BEEN TOLD 

586
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:44,729
SECOND HAND OR THIRD HAND ABOUT 

587
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:45,530
NEARLY 40-YEAR-OLD ALLEGATIONS 

588
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,965
WERE NOT TREATED AS ESSENTIAL 

589
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:51,369
WITNESSES. 

590
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,370
LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN, THE 

591
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,772
LATEST STORY IS THAT THE WHOLE 

592
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:54,806
INVESTIGATION IS INVALID 

593
00:22:54,806 --> 00:23:00,612
BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD 

594
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:01,546
ONLY RECENTLY BEEN TOLD SECOND 

595
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,081
HAND OR THIRD HAND ABOUT NEARLY 

596
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,049
40-YEAR-OLD ALLEGATIONS WERE 

597
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,316
NOT TREATED AS ESSENTIAL 

598
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:10,288
WITNESSES. 

599
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,122
NEVERMIND THAT THEY DID NOT 

600
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:11,923
ACTUALLY WITNESS ANYTHING, THEY 

601
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:17,028
DID NOT WITNESS ANYTHING.

602
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,330
>>> SO LET'S BE CLEAR, MADAM 

603
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,831
PRESIDENT, THESE ARE NOT 

604
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,066
WITNESSES, THESE ARE PEOPLE 

605
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,935
SUPPOSEDLY IMPOSITION OF HEARSAY

606
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,570
THAT THEY FIRST HEARD 35 YEARS 

607
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,340
AFTER THE SUPPOSED FACT. 

608
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,877
WHAT NONSENSE. 

609
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:36,848
THE PEOPLE WHOM DR. FORD CLAIM 

610
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:37,716
WERE WITNESSES, THEY HAVE 

611
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,885
SPOKEN WITH THE FBI.  

612
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:44,222
WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE THEY, 

613
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,357
THROUGH THEIR ATTORNEYS, PUT UP 

614
00:23:46,357 --> 00:23:49,794
PUBLIC STATEMENTS SAYING SO. 

615
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,263
WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS WHAT WE 

616
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:57,168
KNEW AT THIS TIME A WEEK AGO, 

617
00:23:57,168 --> 00:23:57,735
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO 

618
00:23:57,735 --> 00:23:58,803
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE FOR 

619
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:02,307
THESE ALLEGATIONS. 

620
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,009
THE SAME THING WE HEARD A WEEK 

621
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,512
AGO. 

622
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:08,480
IF THERE WERE, YOU BET WE 

623
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,948
WOULD'VE HEARD ABOUT IT, BUT 

624
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,049
THERE ISN'T. 

625
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,451
SO NOTWITHSTANDING THAT, MADAM 

626
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:16,121
PRESIDENT, THE LEAGUE OF DOCTOR 

627
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,589
FORD'S LETTER OPENED THE 

628
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:19,925
FLOODGATES. 

629
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:24,563
THE FEEDING FRENZY WAS FULL ON. 

630
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:29,701
THE WEAPONIZATION OF HER LETTER 

631
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,203
BY THE LEFT LED TO A TORRENT OF 

632
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,437
OTHER EQUALLY UNCORROBORATED 

633
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:32,938
ALLEGATIONS. 

634
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:33,771
THEY WERE DUMPED ON JUDGE 

635
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:36,775
KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY. 

636
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:40,678
AND BREATHLESSLY, BREATHLESSLY 

637
00:24:40,678 --> 00:24:41,713
THE MEDIA SEIZED ON THEM, THE 

638
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:42,948
MORE OUTLANDISH, THE BETTER. 

639
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:47,886
AMERICANS WERE INFORMED THAT HE 

640
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:48,586
MASTERMINDED VIOLENT DRUG GANGS 

641
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:50,288
AS A TEENAGER, UNTIL THAT 

642
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:53,024
ACCUSER WALKED HER STORY BACK. 

643
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:53,725
WE WERE INFORMED THAT JUDGE 

644
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:57,662
KAVANAUGH BEAT SOMEONE UP ON A 

645
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,997
BOAT ANY RHODE ISLAND HARBOR, 

646
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,965
UNTIL THAT ACCUSER TOTALLY 

647
00:25:00,965 --> 00:25:05,070
RECANTED. 

648
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,171
WE HEARD ANOTHER TALL TALE OF 

649
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:06,804
PHYSICAL ASSAULT UNTIL THAT 

650
00:25:06,804 --> 00:25:07,605
ACCOUNT WAS THOROUGHLY DEBUNKED 

651
00:25:07,605 --> 00:25:13,211
BY SITTING FEDERAL JUDGE. 

652
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,179
OH AND YES, WE WERE INFORMED 

653
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,380
THAT JUVENILE JOKES IN HIS HIGH 

654
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,450
SCHOOL YEARBOOK WERE ACTUAL 

655
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,252
SINISTER, SECRET REFERENCES, 

656
00:25:21,252 --> 00:25:24,522
ALL THE KEYSTONE COPS WERE ON 

657
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,224
THE CASE. 

658
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,226
KEYSTONE COPS WERE ON THE CASE, 

659
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,462
MADAM PRESIDENT. 

660
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,464
AND SENATE DEMOCRATS CHEERED 

661
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:36,568
THEM ON. 

662
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:40,271
THEY READ PARTS OF THIS 

663
00:25:40,271 --> 00:25:42,107
UNCORROBORATED MUDSLIDE INTO THE

664
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:47,178
SENATE RECORD. 

665
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,246
THEY CITED THEM IN A OFFICIAL 

666
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,514
LETTER DEMANDING THAT HIS 

667
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,082
NOMINATION BE WITHDRAWN. 

668
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:54,085
WERE THEY TRUE? 

669
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,787
WILL OF COURSE, THAT WAS QUITE 

670
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:56,955
BESIDE THE POINT. 

671
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,724
QUITE BESIDE THE POINT. 

672
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:06,331
SO LONG AS THEY WERE CONVENIENT.

673
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:07,532
EVERY EFFORT WAS MADE TO ENSURE 

674
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,567
THAT THE FACT FREE VERDICT OF 

675
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,302
THE MOB AND THE MEDIA WOULD WIN 

676
00:26:11,302 --> 00:26:14,172
OUT OVER THE ACTUAL EVIDENCE. 

677
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:19,277
MAKE SURE THE MOB PREVAILS. 

678
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,578
BUT THE UNCORROBORATED MUD AND 

679
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,881
PARTISAN NOISE, AND PHYSICAL 

680
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,549
INTIMIDATION OF MEMBERS OF THE 

681
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:25,850
SENATE WILL NOT HAVE THE FINAL 

682
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,154
SAY AROUND HERE. 

683
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:33,792
THE SENATE WILL HAVE THE FINAL 

684
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,326
SAY.

685
00:26:35,326 --> 00:26:36,227
>>> SO MADAM PRESIDENT, WE ARE 

686
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:40,198
ALMOST AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY,

687
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,467
WITH ANGER AND FEAR, AND PERSON 

688
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,870
SHIP, THE CROSSWINDS HAVE BLOWN 

689
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,806
STRONG THIS PAST WEEK. 

690
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:51,876
-- PARTISANSHIP. THEY HAVE 

691
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:52,877
HARMED A GOOD MAN AND HIS 

692
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,480
FAMILY, THEY HAVE TARNISHED THE 

693
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,349
DIGNITY OF THIS INSTITUTION, 

694
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,883
BUT ALL OF IT CAN END TODAY, 

695
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:01,786
THE TIME HAS COME TO VOTE. 

696
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,388
THE SENATE STANDS ON THE 

697
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,889
THRESHOLD OF A GOLDEN 

698
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:08,226
OPPORTUNITY, WE HAVE THE 

699
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,027
OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE THE 

700
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,596
NOMINATION OF AN TWO INCREDIBLY 

701
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,632
WILL QUALIFY DID -- WELL-

702
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:16,601
QUALIFIED JURISTS. 

703
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:20,438
AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT JUDGE 

704
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:21,272
BRETT KAVANAUGH ON THE COURT 

705
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,273
WHERE HIS DISTINGUISHED SERVICE 

706
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,274
WILL MAKE OUR COUNTRY PROUD FOR 

707
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:27,712
YEARS TO COME. 

708
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,180
BUT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO 

709
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,250
DO EVEN MORE. 

710
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,854
TODAY, WE CAN SEND A MESSAGE TO 

711
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:39,057
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT SOME 

712
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:39,624
CORE PRINCIPLES REMAIN 

713
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,492
UNFETTERED BY THE PARTISAN 

714
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,195
PASSIONS OF THIS MOMENT. 

715
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:48,399
FACTS MATTER. 

716
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:48,799
FAIRNESS MATTERS. 

717
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,302
THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IS 

718
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,838
SACROSANCT. 

719
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:58,143
THE SENATE HAS TURNED OF -- 

720
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,410
IT'S BACK ON THESE THINGS 

721
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,713
BEFORE, BUT NEVER FOR LONG AND 

722
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:02,447
WITHOUT DEEP REGRET, THIS 

723
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:07,652
INSTITUTION DOES NOT LOOK BACK 

724
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:08,719
PROBABLY ON THE HEIR OF JOSEPH 

725
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,121
McCARTHY, OR THE OTHER TIMES 

726
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,356
WHEN THE POLITICS OF PERSONAL 

727
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,189
DESTRUCTION POISONED ITS 

728
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:15,960
JUDGMENT. 

729
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,561
NO, THE SENATE LOOKS BACK ON 

730
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,664
THOSE THINGS WITH SHAME. 

731
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:20,765
AND WITH A CONVICTION THAT WE 

732
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,101

00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:35,492
ADVANCE SOMETHING AND THEN VOTE 

919
00:36:35,492 --> 00:36:36,961
AGAINST IT LATER, THAT IS VERY 

920
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:42,500
RARE, BUT IN THIS DAY AND AGE, 

921
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,168
I SHOULD SAY, IT IS 

922
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:47,471
SIGNIFICANT, IF MURKOWSKI CITY 

923
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,107
CLEAR NO, THAT WOULD BE ONE 

924
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:54,111
LESS PERSON.

925
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:57,782
>>> 538.COM, THE NATE SILVER 

926
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:58,482
BLOG HAS SOMETHING INTERESTING 

927
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,518
TO SHARE WITH OUR VIEWERS, 

928
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:01,218
THEIR PERCENTAGE OF THE 

929
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:03,621
SENATORS ON THE BUBBLE THAT 

930
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,189
THEY VOTE WITH PRESIDENT 

931
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,658
TRUMP'S PREFERENCES, SENATOR BEN

932
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:15,366
SAASE, 87% OF THE TIME, JEFF 

933
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:18,502
FLAKE, 84%, AND JOE MANSION, 

934
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:26,177
51%, -- MANCHIN.

935
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,544
>>  THAT IS WHY WE ARE FOCUSED 

936
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:29,914
ON JOE MANCHIN,  HE IS UP FOR 

937
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,718
REELECTION IN A STATE THAT IS 

938
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,119
GETTING AS RED AS IT CAN 

939
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,520
POSSIBLY GET, A STATE THAT 

940
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:47,364
TRUMP WON BY BIG NUMBERS, AND 

941
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:48,332
THE OTHER REPUBLICAN IS RUNNING 

942
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:49,233
AS AN ALLY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, 

943
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:50,201
HOPING HE CAN ABSORB EVERYTHING 

944
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,003
THAT TRUMP CAN GIVE, THAT'S WHY 

945
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:53,104
WE ARE FOCUSED SO OFTEN ON JOE 

946
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,205
MANCHIN, HE HAS CROSSED  THE 

947
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:57,775
AISLE, HE VOTED FOR NEIL 

948
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,877
GORSUCH'S, AND OTHER POSITIONS, 

949
00:38:00,877 --> 00:38:02,780
WE ARE FOCUSED ON HIM, 

950
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,550
ESPECIALLY SINCE LISA MURKOWSKI 

951
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,818
VOTING NO MEANS THAT THEY NEED 

952
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,887
ANOTHER VOTE, AND MIKE PENCE IS 

953
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:13,257
STAYING IN WASHINGTON TO 

954
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:14,558
PERHAPS BE A TIEBREAKER IF 

955
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,993
NEEDED. 

956
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:18,429
IF LISA MURKOWSKI IS A NO, I AM 

957
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:23,434
WONDERING WHAT THAT MEANS FOR 

958
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:24,635
JOE MANCHIN, TWO IS A LOOK AT 

959
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,803
IT, YOU COULD SAY THAT HE COULD 

960
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,171
BE THE REPLACEMENT FOR,  OR 

961
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,539
SOMEONE LIKE MURKOWSKI COULD BE 

962
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,107
GIVING COVER TO JOE MANCHIN , 

963
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:33,844
SO HE CAN GO HOME AND SAY I 

964
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,781
WASN'T THE ONLY ONE.

965
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:43,754
>> HOW MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION 

966
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:44,321
IS BRETT KAVANAUGH VERSUS 

967
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:44,988
TAKING THE TEMPERATURE IN THEIR 

968
00:38:44,988 --> 00:38:47,258
HOME STATES AND FIGURING OUT IF 

969
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,059
THEY PAY THE PRICE FOR THE WAY 

970
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:49,927
THEY VOTE? 

971
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,628
>> I WAS TALKING TO JOE 

972
00:38:51,628 --> 00:38:53,698
MANCHIN'S OFFICE YESTERDAY,  

973
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:54,532
THEY ARE SAYING THEIR PHONE 

974
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,767
LINES ARE OVERLOADED, THEY HAVE 

975
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,336
BEEN GETTING TONS AND TONS OF 

976
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,437
CALLS, I SAID TO THEY ARE 

977
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:02,406
COMING FROM, THEY SAID ALL OVER 

978
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:05,242
THE SPECTRUM, KIND OF DIVIDED, 

979
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,444
AND HE WAS MEETING WITH VICTIMS 

980
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:07,711
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT IN HIS 

981
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:11,182
OFFICE, AS WAS MURKOWSKI, ALL 

982
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,149
OF THIS LOBBYING GOING ON 

983
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:12,950
BEHIND THE SCENES, AND LAST-

984
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:17,488
MINUTE EFFORTS TO FIGURE THIS 

985
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:17,888
OUT. 

986
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:21,192
>> WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHAT IS 

987
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,927
PLAYING OUT ON THE FLOOR OF THE 

988
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:23,360
U.S. SENATE? 

989
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,296
>> WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS 

990
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,798
HOW HAVE THESE PEOPLE REACTED 

991
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:31,335
TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S OP-ED, 

992
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:34,939
WHERE HE WAS APOLOGETIC ABOUT 

993
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:40,511
HIS BEHAVIOR DURING THE HEARING?

994
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,612
I THINK THAT GIVES THE SENATORS 

995
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,413
WHO ARE ON THE FENCE A LOT OF 

996
00:39:43,413 --> 00:39:45,850
COVER, BUT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO 

997
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,086
LOOK AT AND SEE IS EXACTLY 

998
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:52,790
WHERE YOU WERE, JOE MANCHIN, I 

999
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,424
HAVE MET HIM IN THE PAST,  MY 

1000
00:39:54,424 --> 00:39:57,027
HUSBAND HAS KNOWN HIM IN THE 

1001
00:39:57,027 --> 00:40:00,631
PAST, HE IS A PERSON OF GREAT 

1002
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,667
CONSCIENCE, AND THIS HAS TO BE 

1003
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,102
A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION FOR 

1004
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,772
HIM, THAT HE STAYS WITH HIS 

1005
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,306
PARTY, OR GOES WITH THIS DATE? 

1006
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,876
WHAT IS HIS ROLE, AS A SENATOR, 

1007
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:16,013
DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN, TO 

1008
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,214
REPRESENT THE WILL OF THE 

1009
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:18,515
PEOPLE OF THE STATE HE 

1010
00:40:18,515 --> 00:40:20,651
REPRESENTS, THE WILL OF THE 

1011
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,653
PEOPLE AS A RED STATE, TO WANT 

1012
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,122
TO CONFIRM KAVANAUGH DESPITE 

1013
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,892
THE FACT THAT HE IS A DEMOCRAT. 

1014
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,060
I THINK HE IS IN THE MOST 

1015
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,398
CHALLENGING POSITION OF ALL.

1016
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:35,999
>> HE IS IN A REALLY DIFFICULT 

1017
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:38,569
POSITION, I WAS TALKING TO 

1018
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:39,904
REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS WHO HAVE 

1019
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,138
BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE 

1020
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:45,609
CAMPAIGNS, AND HE SAID THAT IF 

1021
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,546
JOE MANCHIN  VOTES FOR 

1022
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:49,914
KAVANAUGH, THE RAISES IN HIS 

1023
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,650
FAVOR, IF HE VOTES AGAINST HIM, 

1024
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:58,989
HE THINKS THE RACES OVER. 

1025
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,024
SO JOE MANCHIN HAS CARVED OUT, 

1026
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,025
AS RICKY SAID, AN IDENTITY FOR 

1027
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,793
HIMSELF IN WEST VIRGINIA,  BUT 

1028
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:03,660
WE ARE ANYTIME NOW WHERE 

1029
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:09,667
POLITICS HAS BECOME VERY TRIBAL,

1030
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:10,701
HE IS THE LAST DEMOCRAT 

1031
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:11,735
STANDING IN WEST VIRGINIA AT A 

1032
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:12,603
FEDERAL AND LOCAL LEVEL IN 

1033
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:13,771
TERMS OF PUBLIC OFFICE, SO HIM 

1034
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:14,572
VOTING YES ON THIS IS 

1035
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,474
IMPORTANT, AND IF HE DOES IN 

1036
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:19,343
FACT CONTINUE TO VOTE YES ON 

1037
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:23,213
THE FINAL VOTE, THAT GIVES 

1038
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:24,281
KAVANAUGH SOME BIPARTISAN 

1039
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:24,614
CONFIRMATION. 

1040
00:41:24,614 --> 00:41:27,184
>> IT DOES APPEAR --

1041
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:30,554
>> BY A THREAD.

1042
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:31,856
>> WE ARE TRYING TO LISTEN TO 

1043
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,592
THE VOTE ON THE FLOOR, WE HAVE 

1044
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:35,459
REPORTERS OBVIOUSLY ON THE 

1045
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:37,261
FLOOR OF THE SENATE, AND IT 

1046
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,697
DOES LOOK LIKE SENATOR MURKOWSKI

1047
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:43,334
VOTED NO ON THE PROCEDURAL VOTE 

1048
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,302
TO ADVANCE JUDGE KAVANAUGH, BUT 

1049
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,872
SENATOR FLAKE, JOE MANCHIN , 

1050
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:51,275
AND COLLINS, CAN WE CONFIRM 

1051
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:57,281
THAT THEY VOTED YES?

1052
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:01,185
>> THEY ARE LOOKING INTO THAT.

1053
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:05,823
>> I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT 

1054
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,257
JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE VOTES YES 

1055
00:42:07,257 --> 00:42:11,629
OR NO, ON THE PROCEDURAL VOTE 

1056
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,529
DOES NOT MEAN THAT IS THEIR 

1057
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:15,533
VOTE FINALLY, THE GREAT EXAMPLE 

1058
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,967
IS JOHN McCAIN, DEALING WITH 

1059
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,269
THE HEALTHCARE BILL, HE VOTED 

1060
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:23,574
YES ON THE CLOTURE VOTE, AND 

1061
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,075
THEN NO ULTIMATELY ON THE 

1062
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:29,413
HEALTHCARE BILL. 

1063
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:30,414
THANK YOU FOR CALLING IN, WE 

1064
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,482
APPRECIATE IT, I KNOW YOU ARE 

1065
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:32,917
GETTING ON A FLIGHT.>> THANK

YOU . 

1067
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:35,585
>>> AS WE TRY TO NAIL DOWN HOW 

1068
00:42:35,585 --> 00:42:41,191
THESE FOLKS OF VOTED, WE HAVE 

1069
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:41,925
BEEN SAYING TO OUR AUDIENCE, 

1070
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:43,160
THIS IS NOT THE VOTE, THIS IS 

1071
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,063
JUST THE VOTE FOR CLOTURE, BUT 

1072
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:46,797
IT DOES HISTORICALLY GIVE 

1073
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:47,798
INSIGHT INTO HOW SOME OF THE 

1074
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:48,966
SENATORS MIGHT POSSIBLY VOTE 

1075
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,066
TOMORROW. 

1076
00:42:50,066 --> 00:42:54,404
>> THAT IS WHY MURKOWSKI IS 

1077
00:42:54,404 --> 00:42:56,373
SIGNIFICANT.

1078
00:42:56,373 --> 00:43:00,077
>> CONFIRMED, SENATORS JEFF 

1079
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,746
FLAKE, COLLINS, AND JOE MANCHIN 

1080
00:43:03,746 --> 00:43:04,981
VOTED YES, AND  SENATOR 

1081
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:08,786
MURKOWSKI CASTED A NO VOTE. 

1082
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,688
>> SHE IS CONSIDERED A MORE 

1083
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:11,789
MODERATE REPUBLICAN, OFTEN A 

1084
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,124
SWING VOTE ON A FEW THINGS, SHE 

1085
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:17,895
HAS TALKED ABOUT THIS VOTE 

1086
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:20,331
BEYOND BRETT KAVANAUGH, ENGAGED 

1087
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,199
IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE ME 

1088
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:25,402
TOO MOVEMENT, WHAT THIS MEANS 

1089
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:27,171
IN TERMS OF BELIEVING WOMEN WITH

1090
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,706
ACCUSATIONS, SHE HAS ENGAGED 

1091
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:31,641
THE DEBATE. 

1092
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:32,509
SECOND, THE GOVERNOR OF THE 

1093

STATE OPPOSES BRETT KAVANAUGH, 

1094
00:43:33,343 --> 00:43:35,446
A LOT OF RESISTANCE TO 

1095
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:39,049
KAVANAUGH. 

1096
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:39,883
THEY BELIEVE SOME OF HIS 

1097
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,285
RULINGS ON TRIBAL ISSUES ARE 

1098
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:48,325
VERY PROBLEMATIC, HER VOTING NO 

1099
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,194
TO ADVANCE THE BILL LIKE MEAN 

1100
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:53,630
SHE IS VOTING NO ON FINAL 

1101
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:53,863
PASSAGE.

1102
00:43:53,863 --> 00:43:58,502
>> WHAT IS THE STRATEGY BEHIND 

1103
00:43:58,502 --> 00:43:59,303
SUSAN COLLINS VOTING TO 

1104
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,436
PROCEED, THEN SAYING TO THE 

1105
00:44:00,436 --> 00:44:01,872
WORLD IN PUBLIC THAT SHE WILL 

1106
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,241
ANNOUNCE HER FINAL VOTE AT 3 PM 

1107
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:04,775
TODAY? 

1108
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:05,909
WHAT IS THE STRATEGY? 

1109
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:10,080
>> A VOTE FOR CLOTURE IS A VOTE 

1110
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:15,085
TO OPEN UP DEBATE FOR THE 

1111
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:16,220
FLOOR, GIVEN HOW THE POLITICS 

1112
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,220
IS, PEOPLE VOTE THE SAME WAY ON 

1113
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,756
CLOTURE AND FINAL PASSAGE. 

1114
00:44:19,756 --> 00:44:24,294
BUT I'M WONDERING IF EITHER 

1115
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:25,329
SUSAN COLLINS IS JUST VOTING TO 

1116
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,463
OPEN UP THE DEBATE, AND ONCE TO 

1117
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:30,968
TAKE TIME TO START TO EXPLAIN 

1118
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:34,905
WHAT SHE IS GOING TO DO AT 3 PM,

1119
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,106
IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT SHE 

1120
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:36,940
WILL EXPLAIN WHAT HER FINAL 

1121
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:41,879
VOTE WILL BE, THAT COULD BE 

1122
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:42,980
THAT SHE COULD COME OUT AND SAY 

1123
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,782
THIS IS THE REASON WHY I AM 

1124
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,450
VOTING FOR HIM, AND I WANT TO 

1125
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,818
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY 

1126
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,521
THAT EVERYBODY, OR IT COULD BE 

1127
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:50,988
SOMETHING ELSE HERE. 

1128
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:54,691
>> IS A BECAUSE SHE IS STILL -- 

1129
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:55,693
I KNOW WE ARE ASKING TO 

1130
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,593
SPECULATE ON WHAT SHE IS 

1131
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:57,895
THINKING, IS SHE REALLY STILL 

1132
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:58,328
ON THE FENCE? 

1133
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,497
>> WHAT IS INTERESTING TO 

1134
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:04,834
CONSIDER ABOUT COLLINS COMPARED 

1135
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:05,803
TO MURKOWSKI, IS THAT COLLINS 

1136
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:06,503
IS TALKED VERY FAVORABLY ABOUT 

1137
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,739
THEM IN THE PAST, ROE V WADE 

1138
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:11,508
HAS BEEN A KEY STICKING POINT 

1139
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:12,876
FOR DEMOCRATS AND MORE MODERATE 

1140
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,612
REPUBLICANS LIKE COLLINS AND 

1141
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:17,381
MURKOWSKI, AND COLLINS HAS SAID 

1142
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,749
AFTER MEETING WITH JUDGE 

1143
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:19,249
KAVANAUGH BEFORE THESE 

1144
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:22,553
ALLEGATIONS CAME OUT, SHE WAS 

1145
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,387
CONFIDENT THAT HE WOULD NOT 

1146
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,390
VOTE TO OVERTURN ROE V WADE AND 

1147
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:31,595
CONFIDENT IN HIS EXPERIENCE. 

1148
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:32,696
SHE HAS BEEN LOOKING, IN THE 

1149
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:33,864
WAY SHE HAS BEEN APPROACHING 

1150
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,199
IT, A LOT OF THEM WANT TO VOTE 

1151
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:40,738
YES ON A JUDICIAL NOMINEE, FOR 

1152
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:41,772
REPUBLICANS, THIS IS AN 

1153
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:42,472
ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE IN TERMS 

1154
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:46,076
OF ELECTIONS, SOMETHING THAT HAS

1155
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,045
BEEN TRADITIONALLY CRITICAL FOR 

1156
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:48,979
REPUBLICANS, THEY SEE THIS 

1157
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:52,415
OPPORTUNITY TO SHAPE THE COURT 

1158
00:45:52,415 --> 00:45:53,049
DIFFERENTLY THAN DEMOCRATS, 

1159
00:45:53,049 --> 00:45:58,222
THAT MIGHT CHANGE THE MIDTERMS, 

1160
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:59,156
BUT SUSAN COLLINS HAS BEEN 

1161
00:45:59,156 --> 00:45:59,922
TALKING IN WAYS THAT SUGGESTS 

1162
00:45:59,922 --> 00:46:01,592
SHE WANTS TO GET TO YES. 

1163
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,292
THE FBI REPORT CAME OUT 

1164
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,628
YESTERDAY, THERE IS AN ARGUMENT 

1165
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,897
THAT GAVE SOME POLITICAL COVER.

1166
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:07,931
>> HERE'S THE BREAKDOWN OF HOW 

1167
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:12,603
THE SENATORS HAVE VOTED, THE 

1168
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,570
NOMINATION ADVANCES TO THE 

1169
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,572
FINAL FLOOR VOTE, BECAUSE YOU 

1170
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:23,947
CAN SEE THE YEAS HAVE IT AT 51-

1171
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:29,753
49 NO. 

1172
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:30,520
IT WILL BE SOMETIME TOMORROW 

1173
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,188
FOR THE FINAL VOTE. 

1174
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:32,122
>> LAST NIGHT, WE WERE GETTING 

1175
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,356
REPORTS THAT STEVE DAINES, A 

1176
00:46:33,356 --> 00:46:35,592
REPUBLICAN FROM MONTANA, NEEDS 

1177
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:38,662
TO BE BACK IN MONTANA TO WALK 

1178
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:40,898
HIS DAUGHTER DOWN THE AISLE, HE 

1179
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,099
SAID HE NEEDS TO DO THAT, AND 

1180
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,635
HE WILL DO THAT, THAT EXPRESSED 

1181
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,869
TO US YESTERDAY THAT THERE WAS 

1182
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,170
CONFIDENCE THAT THEY HAD THE 

1183
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,038
VOTES.

1184
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:55,679
>> I WANT TO FLAG A TWEET FROM 

1185
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:56,546
SUSAN PAGE, THE USA TODAY 

1186
00:46:56,546 --> 00:46:57,214
WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, SHE 

1187
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:57,915
PUT SOMETHING INTERESTING ON 

1188
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:59,483
TWITTER, I WILL QUOTE HER, ONE 

1189
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,518
CONSEQUENCE OF JOE MANCHIN 

1190
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:03,120
VOTING YES AND MURKOWSKI VOTING 

1191
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,490
NO,  IS THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 

1192
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,091
WON'T BE THE FIRST SUPREME 

1193
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:11,962
COURT JUSTICE CONFIRMED ALONG 

1194
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:16,466
STRICTLY PARTISAN LIES -- LINES.

1195
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,502
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN THE 

1196
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,071
SENATE, OR LAWMAKERS, THAT THIS 

1197
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:23,373
WILL COME DOWN TO PARTY LINES, 

1198
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:25,776
AND IT MAY ULTIMATELY NOT BE 

1199
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,277
THAT.

1200
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:27,878
>> RAZOR THIN. 

1201
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:30,948
>> SUPREME COURT NOMINEES USED 

1202
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:34,785
TO BE TRADITIONALLY BIPARTISAN, 

1203
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:39,255
LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID I VOTED FOR 

1204
00:47:39,255 --> 00:47:45,162
KAGAN AND SOTOMAYOR, THE 

1205
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:46,263
PRESIDENT, HAS THE POWER TO 

1206
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:47,664
CONFIRM A NOMINEE, FOR THE 

1207
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:52,235
SUPREME COURT. 

1208
00:47:52,235 --> 00:47:52,869
THIS HAS BEEN CHANGING. 

1209
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:53,770
>> YOU HEARD SOME OF THE 

1210
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,706
SENATORS BEFORE THE VOTE TRY TO 

1211
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,740
REMIND US WHAT THE BEGINNING OF 

1212
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,275
THIS WAS, REMIND US THAT THE 

1213
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:06,183
DEBATE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT 

1214
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:07,217
HIS FITNESS AS A JUDGE, HIS 

1215
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,452
RECORD, HIS LEGAL EXPERIENCE, 

1216
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:09,586
AND CLEARLY, THEY DIFFER ON 

1217
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:10,954
WHETHER THEY GOT ENOUGH 

1218
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:11,287
INFORMATION. 

1219
00:48:11,287 --> 00:48:15,659
BUT REMEMBER WHEN THE BIG 

1220
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:16,359
CONTROVERSY WAS DOCUMENTS FROM 

1221
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:17,827
WHEN HE WORKED FOR THE BUSH 

1222
00:48:17,827 --> 00:48:18,394
MINISTRATION, AND WHETHER 

1223
00:48:18,394 --> 00:48:19,563
THOUSANDS OR HUNDREDS OF 

1224
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:23,000
THOUSANDS WERE RELEASED, THAT 

1225
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,501
SEEMS LIKE SEVERAL MONTHS AGO 

1226
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:25,902
THAT HAPPEN.

1227
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:33,877
>> CAN YOU REPEAT THAT, CONTROL 

1228
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:34,344
ROOM? 

1229
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:35,946
MOLLY HOOPER IS JOINING US ON 

1230
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:43,287
THE PHONE TO TALK ABOUT THIS, 

1231
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:44,187
THIS IS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION, NO 

1232
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:45,155
MATTER HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT, 

1233
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:46,823
THE WAY YOU ARE LEANING, THE 

1234
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:51,395
WIND IS BLOWING, THIS IS WHAT 

1235
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:52,029
DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE. 

1236
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:53,663
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHAT WE 

1237
00:48:53,663 --> 00:48:54,030
JUST WITNESSED? 

1238
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,433
>> THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS 

1239
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,567
LIKE, EXACTLY, THAT'S ONE OF 

1240
00:48:57,567 --> 00:48:59,770
THE CHANCE I'VE HEARD OUTSIDE 

1241
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,872
THE SUPREME COURT, REGARDING 

1242
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,041
THESE ISSUES. 

1243
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:04,774
YES, THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY 

1244
00:49:04,774 --> 00:49:07,811
LOOKS LIKE YOUR WHAT THEY VOTED 

1245
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:10,247
ON TODAY WAS SIMPLY A MOVE TO A 

1246
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:12,482
FINAL VOTE ON THE CONFIRMATION, 

1247
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:17,854
AND JUST BECAUSE SUE IS TASHA 

1248
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:18,855
SUSAN COLLINS VOTED ON THIS, IT 

1249
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:20,457
DOESN'T AND ASSUMING A VOTE ON 

1250
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,124
CONFIRMATION, IT PROBABLY WILL 

1251
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,192
BE, BUT THIS WAS A PROCEDURAL 

1252
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:29,566
VOTE, THE FACT THAT JOE MANCHIN 

1253
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:35,405
VOTED YES,  IS NOT SOMETHING 

1254
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:36,540
SPECIFIC, IT IS A RULE VOTE, 

1255
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,508
THEY CALL IT, THE PEOPLE IN 

1256
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:43,980
POWER, REPUBLICANS VOTE AGAINST 

1257
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,215
A RULE IN THE HOUSE, AND THEY 

1258
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,216
VOTE IN A PROCEDURAL RULE LIKE 

1259
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:48,185
THIS IN THE SENATE, THAT IS 

1260
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:48,919
ALMOST MORE UPSETTING TO THE 

1261
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,220
LEADERSHIP THAN THE FINAL VOTE, 

1262
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,089
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY, WHAT THE 

1263
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:56,026
LEADERS WANT IS A VOTE ON 

1264
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:56,693
CONFIRMATION REGARDLESS OF 

1265
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,228
WHETHER IT IS UP OR DOWN, GET A 

1266
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:00,130
VOTE ON THE CONFIRMATION, AND 

1267
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,898
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY WAS JUST 

1268
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:07,471
MOVING TO THE FINAL VOTE.

1269
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:08,705
>> DO YOU BUY THIS IDEA THAT 

1270
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:10,674
BECAUSE HE GOT AT LEAST ONE 

1271
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,944
DEMOCRATIC VOTE, PERHAPS HE CAN 

1272
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,212
GO DOWN IN HISTORY, HE WILL BE 

1273
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:15,946
REMEMBERED AS AT LEAST A 

1274
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:16,880
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE THAT THE 

1275
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,582
VOTES WERE NOT ALONG PARTY 

1276
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,318
LINES? 

1277
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:22,285
I PERSONALLY FEEL THE WAY THE 

1278
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,354
LARGER DEBATE HAS BEEN GOING, 

1279
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,823
IT'S GOING TO SEEM LIKE A VERY 

1280
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:27,223
PARTISAN DECISION?

1281
00:50:27,223 --> 00:50:31,695
>> I THINK IT WILL. 

1282
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,862
AND THE REASON I SAY THIS IS 

1283
00:50:32,862 --> 00:50:35,165
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE 

1284
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:38,869
PREVIOUS SUPREME COURT JUSTICES,

1285
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,071
OVER THE PAST FEW 

1286
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:47,543
ADMINISTRATIONS, INCLUDING 

1287
00:50:47,543 --> 00:50:53,483
SOTOMAYOR AND KAGAN, IT WAS 

1288
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:54,484
VERY PARTISAN, UP UNTIL 

1289
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:56,453
CLARENCE THOMAS, THEY WERE 

1290
00:50:56,453 --> 00:51:00,490
ESSENTIALLY 99-0, RUTH BADER 

1291
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:03,393
GINSBURG, 97-0, PRETTY MUCH 

1292
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:08,098
UNANIMOUS, THAT IS THE ADVISE 

1293
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:09,232
AND CONSENT RULE, BUT WHEN YOU 

1294
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,267
GOT TO CLARENCE THOMAS, AND 

1295
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:15,271
JUSTICES FOLLOWING HIM, THE 

1296
00:51:15,271 --> 00:51:15,972
PARTY LINES STARTED BREAKING 

1297
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:17,374
DOWN, AND THE CLOSER THE VOTE 

1298
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:22,712
GETS, THE MORE PARTISAN IT GETS.

1299
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:24,881
SO YES, IT WILL BE HARD TO SEE 

1300
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:28,351
HE WILL BE A FIGURE VOTED ON A 

1301
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:29,486
BIPARTISAN BASIS. 

1302
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:33,356
IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU 

1303
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:36,593
HAVE CONFIRMED IT. 

1304
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,493
REGARDLESS.>> IT IS CAITLIN, 

1305
00:51:37,493 --> 00:51:38,528
WHAT IS INTERESTING TO ME IS 

1306
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,630
THAT SUSAN COLLINS OF COURSE 

1307
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:45,402
VOTED YES ON CLOTURE, BUT SHE 

1308
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:46,503
HAS SAID LATER TODAY THAT SHE'S 

1309
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:47,203
GOING TO ANNOUNCE HER DECISION 

1310
00:51:47,203 --> 00:51:48,472
ON FINAL PASSAGE AT 3 PM, WHAT 

1311
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:55,212
ARE YOU HEARING? 

1312
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:55,945
DO YOU EXPECT SHE WILL CONTINUE 

1313
00:51:55,945 --> 00:51:57,013
THE VOTE, OR DOES SHE CHANGE 

1314
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:57,346
YOUR MIND? 

1315
00:51:57,346 --> 00:51:58,548
WHAT IS YOUR SENSE? 

1316
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:02,118
>> AGAIN, SUSAN COLLINS IS ONE 

1317
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,052
OF THOSE SENATORS WHO IS GOING 

1318
00:52:03,052 --> 00:52:03,920
BACK AND LOOKING AT THESE 

1319
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,524
DOCUMENTS, IS STILL CONSIDERING 

1320
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,359
WHAT SHE HAS SEEN, AND AS I 

1321
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,362
SAID EARLIER, THE REASON WHY I 

1322
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:13,997
BROUGHT UP THE POINT ABOUT THE 

1323
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:14,597
PROCEDURAL MATTERS, WHEN YOU 

1324
00:52:14,597 --> 00:52:17,434
VOTE AGAINST CLOTURE, I.E. 

1325
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:24,774
VOTING -- MOVING THE VOTE. WHAT 

1326
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:25,575
COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENT YOU GET 

1327
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:30,580
NEXT CONGRESS, CHAIRMANSHIPS, 

1328
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,581
AND MURKOWSKI VOTING NO TO MOVE 

1329
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:35,252
ON TO A FINAL VOTE, THAT COULD 

1330
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,486
HURT HER IN TERMS OF HER ROLE 

1331
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:39,522
IN THE SENATE, HER CHAIRMANSHIP 

1332
00:52:39,522 --> 00:52:40,757
OF THE ENVIRONMENT, AND THE 

1333
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:41,657
RESOURCES COMMITTEE, OR 

1334
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:42,492
SENIORITY. 

1335
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:46,896
AGAIN, EVEN THOUGH COLLINS DID 

1336
00:52:46,896 --> 00:52:48,832
VOTE FOR CLOTURE, I DO WONDER 

1337
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,299
IF SHE IS STILL FIGURING IT 

1338
00:52:50,299 --> 00:52:56,039
OUT.>> SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU, 

1339
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:57,173
I WAS GOING TO SAY IN RESPONSE 

1340
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:58,775
TO WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THERE,

1341
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:00,610
WHICH IS THAT IT IS INTERESTING 

1342
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,779
THAT MURKOWSKI VOTES NO, 

1343
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,214
BECAUSE WE HAVE HEARD ALL ALONG 

1344
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:06,149
THAT SHE HAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT 

1345
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:07,350
NUMBER OF CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE 

1346
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,221
AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH, THE 

1347
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,022
GOVERNOR OF HER STATE IS NOT 

1348
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,556
SUPPORTIVE OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 

1349
00:53:13,556 --> 00:53:17,894
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU'VE GOT 

1350
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:19,095
JOE MANCHIN, FACING A TOUGH 

1351
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:20,430
REELECTION BATTLE  IN WEST 

1352
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:23,333
VIRGINIA, HE HAS VOTED YES. 

1353
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:24,467
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS FINAL 

1354
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,870
VOTE WILL BE, BUT IN THIS CASE, 

1355
00:53:26,870 --> 00:54:00,103
DOES IT FEEL LIKE MURKOWSKI AND 

1356
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:01,771
EACH SENATOR IS ELECTED BY 

1357
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:02,872
CONSTITUTE FEW INCIDENTS IN 

1358
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:03,373
THEIR STATE. 

1359
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,174
IF THEIR STATE DOESN'T WANT 

1360
00:54:05,174 --> 00:54:07,811
THEM TO VOTE A CERTAIN WAY AND 

1361
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:08,978
THE SENATOR VOTES THE OPPOSITE, 

1362
00:54:08,978 --> 00:54:09,712
THEY MAY GET OUSTED. 

1363
00:54:09,712 --> 00:54:11,781
YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN YOUR STATE 

1364
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:16,886
THAT WANT YOU TO VOTE A CERTAIN 

1365
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:17,787
WAY. 

1366
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:18,955
THEY WILL REELECT SOMEBODY 

1367
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:19,155
ELSE. 

1368
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:20,390
SO, BOTH SENATORS ARE LOOKING 

1369
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:25,628
AND LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE IN 

1370
00:54:25,628 --> 00:54:27,497
THEIR STATE AND KAITLYN'S 

1371
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,833
POINT, THE NATIVE ALASKAN 

1372
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:32,936
POPULATION IS A HUGE 

1373
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:33,503
CONSTITUENCY OF MURKOWSKI. 

1374
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:34,671
SHE RAN AS A WRITE-IN CANDIDATE 

1375
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:36,373
I BELIEVE IN 2010 OR EARLIER 

1376
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:41,077
AGAINST JOE MILLER WHO WON THE 

1377
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:41,677
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION AT THE 

1378
00:54:41,677 --> 00:54:41,877
TIME. 

1379
00:54:41,877 --> 00:54:47,083
A LARGE BASE OF HER SUPPORT WAS 

1380
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,785
THE NATIVE ALASKAN POPULATION. 

1381
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:49,953
THEY ARE AGAINST BRETT 

1382
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:50,253
KAVANAUGH. 

1383
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:52,088
ONE THING THAT STRUCK ME DURING 

1384
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:54,023
THE HEARING, DIDN'T BRING UP 

1385
00:54:54,023 --> 00:54:57,327
THE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT 

1386
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:59,095
ALLEGATIONS BUT BRETT 

1387
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:01,097
KAVANAUGH'S E-MAILS AND 

1388
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,198
WRITINGS REGARDING THE NATIVE 

1389
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:03,867
HAWAIIAN POPULATION THAT COULD 

1390
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:06,603
INDICATE HOW HE FEELS ABOUT 

1391
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:08,772
SELF GOVERNANCE FOR NATIVE 

1392
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:09,939
POPULATIONS IN GENERAL. 

1393
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:12,842
IT WAS POINTED AT LISA 

1394
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:13,276
MURKOWSKI. 

1395
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:14,644
SHE ANSWERS TO HER NATIVE 

1396
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,077
ALASKAN POPULATION. 

1397
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:16,379
THEY WILL BE THE ONES THAT GET 

1398
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:18,881
OUT AND VOTE FOR HER NEXT 

1399
00:55:18,881 --> 00:55:19,282
ELECTION. 

1400
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:23,253
SO, YES, I THINK SHE IS 

1401
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:24,120
LISTENING TO HER CONSTITUENTS. 

1402
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,790
>> I THINK JUST GOING OFF OF 

1403
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,926
THAT, WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT 

1404
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:32,228
THIS PARTICULAR FIGHT, MOLLIE 

1405
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:33,797
MENTIONED TRADITIONALLY SUPREME 

1406
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:36,733
COURT JUSTICES BE JOY A 

1407
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:38,835
BIPARTISAN VOTE. 

1408
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:42,005
NEIL GORSUCH GOT THREE 

1409
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,606
DEMOCRATS IN MUNITION, HEITKAMP 

1410
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:43,939
AND DONNELLY. 

1411
00:55:43,939 --> 00:55:45,308
WE HAVE TO SAY THE PRESIDENT 

1412
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:46,576
HAS BEEN FRAMING THIS IN 

1413
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:47,610
STRICTLY POLITICAL TERMS. 

1414
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,579
HE HAS BEEN ON THE CAMPAIGN 

1415
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:50,780
TRAIL ALL WEEK VISITING DEEP 

1416
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,149
RED STATES WHERE HE IS VERY 

1417
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:53,416
POPULAR. 

1418
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:54,584
THE FEEDBACK HE IS GETTING AND 

1419
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,386
WHAT HE HAS BEEN TELLING HIS 

1420
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:58,288
SUPPORTERS IS THAT A VOTE 

1421
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:00,523
AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS A 

1422
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,891
VOTE AGAINST TRUMP AND THE 

1423
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,093
ADMINISTRATION AND THE AGENDA 

1424
00:56:04,093 --> 00:56:05,728
AND WHAT YOU THE TRUMP VOTER 

1425
00:56:05,728 --> 00:56:06,028
SUPPORTED. 

1426
00:56:06,028 --> 00:56:07,997
THAT HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT 

1427
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,599
HAS GALVANIZED REPUBLICANS AND 

1428
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,534
THE SUPREME COURT BATTLE HAS 

1429
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,802
THE POTENTIAL -- WE SAW IT IN 

1430
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:16,272
2016 AND WE ARE SEEING IT NOW 

1431
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,174
TO COALESCE THE REPUBLICAN 

1432
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,576
PARTY AROUND DONALD TRUMP EVEN 

1433
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,277
AFTER THEY VIEW MANY THINGS 

1434
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:22,779
THAT HE HAS DONE AS UNFAVORABLE 

1435
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:25,882
OR THEY TAKE ISSUE WITH HIS 

1436
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,383
RHETORIC, THE SUPREME COURT 

1437
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:28,184
FIGHTS, THE JUDICIAL 

1438
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:29,486
NOMINATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 

1439
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:30,887
ARE SO IMPORTANT TO THEM. 

1440
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,589
THE PRESIDENT HAS SEIZED ON 

1441
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:32,789
THAT. 

1442
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:34,891
NOW, YOU CAN ARGUE THAT CAN 

1443
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,292
THEY SUSTAIN THAT THE NEXT 

1444
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:37,093
MONTH OR SO? 

1445
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:39,229
AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS POINT IN 

1446
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,731
TIME ON THIS PARTICULAR VOTE 

1447
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:42,298
IT'S CLEAR THAT REPUBLICANS 

1448
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:43,966
WERE UNITED WITH THE EXCEPTION 

1449
00:56:43,966 --> 00:56:44,901
OF MURKOWSKI AROUND THIS 

1450
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:45,168
NOMINEE. 

1451
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:48,071
>> WHAT WE HAVE SEEN WITH THE 

1452
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,538
PRESIDENT, AT SOME OF HIS 

1453
00:56:49,538 --> 00:56:50,573
RALLIES, HE HAS A NARRATIVE 

1454
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,409
THAT HE IS PUSHING THAT EVEN IF 

1455
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,676
THEY GET THE SUPREME COURT 

1456
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:56,379
JUSTICE THAT THEY WANT, YOU 

1457
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:57,580
SHOULD BE ANGRY BECAUSE THEY 

1458
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,482
NEVER SHOULD HAVE PUT THIS GOOD 

1459
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:00,683
MAN THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE 

1460
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:00,883
THIS. 

1461
00:57:00,883 --> 00:57:01,817
PAULA REID IS STANDING BY. 

1462
00:57:01,817 --> 00:57:02,986
WE ARE HEARING FROM THE WHITE 

1463
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:05,688
HOUSE NOW ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL 

1464
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:06,622
ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE GOING. 

1465
00:57:06,622 --> 00:57:08,257
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? 

1466
00:57:08,257 --> 00:57:09,292
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

1467
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:12,529
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS TELL ME 

1468
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:13,162
THEY ARE CONFIDENT CALLING THE 

1469
00:57:13,162 --> 00:57:15,031
PROCEDURAL VOTE THAT THEY CAN 

1470
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:17,500
GET ENOUGH VOTES TO CONFIRM 

1471
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:17,900
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

1472
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,103
THEY ARE NOT TAKING ANYTHING 

1473
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:20,570
FOR GRANTED. 

1474
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,505
THEY ARE STILL PURSUING SOME 

1475
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:22,972
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS. 

1476
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:24,974
JOE DONNELLY OF INDIANA, EVEN 

1477
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:27,977
THOUGH HE SAID HE MAY VOTE NO, 

1478
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:28,510
THEY ARE PURSUING HIM. 

1479
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,880
THEY ARE TRYING TO FLIP ANYONE 

1480
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,715
THEY CAN, WORKING THE PHONES TO 

1481
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:35,184
GET JUDGE KAVANAUGH ACROSS THE 

1482
00:57:35,184 --> 00:57:35,517
FINISH LINE. 

1483
00:57:35,517 --> 00:57:37,454
WE ARE TOLD THAT THE WHITE 

1484
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,422
HOUSE BELIEVES JOE MANCHIN WILL 

1485
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:41,491
END UP ULTIMATELY VOTING FOR 

1486
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:41,991
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

1487
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:45,628
HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THIS A SHORT 

1488
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:45,894
TIME AGO. 

1489
00:57:45,894 --> 00:57:47,830
HE SAID HE WAS STILL UNDECIDED. 

1490
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:51,600
THE WHITE HOUSE IT IS 

1491
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,301
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. 

1492
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:53,202
IN THEIR WORDS CONFIDENT. 

1493
00:57:53,202 --> 00:57:55,605
>> WE SAW A TWEET FROM THE 

1494
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:57,140
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 

1495
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,409
VERY PROUD OF THE U.S. SENATE 

1496
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:01,411
FOR VOTING YES TO ADVANCE THE 

1497
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:04,080
NOMINATION OF JUDGE BRETT 

1498
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:04,380
KAVANAUGH. 

1499
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,281
IT'S SOMETHING THAT ANNE-MARIE 

1500
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:06,182
POINTED OUT, THE PRESIDENT HAS 

1501
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:09,986
BEEN VOCAL AND IT FEELS FOR A 

1502
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,688
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THIS 

1503
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:14,390
DISCUSSION AROUND JUDGE 

1504
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,292
KAVANAUGH HAS MOVED BEYOND THE 

1505
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:19,829
ORIGINAL SEXUAL MISCONDUCT 

1506
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,030
ALLEGATIONS AND SEXUAL 

1507
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,600
HARASSMENT ASSAULT ALLEGATION 

1508
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,034
THAT CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD AND 

1509
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:25,935
DEBORAH A MIR REDS MADE AGAINST 

1510
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:29,205
JUDGE CAVE NOW AND NOW IT'S A 

1511
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:31,407
-- KAVANAUGH AND NOW IT'S A 

1512
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:32,475
POLITICAL FOOTBALL WHERE THE 

1513
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:35,511
PRESIDENT CAN FRAME IT AS IF 

1514
00:58:35,511 --> 00:58:36,579
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS A MARTYR AND 

1515
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:38,414
A MARTYR TO MEN ACROSS THE 

1516
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:40,783
COUNTRY THAT MIGHT BE FALSELY 

1517
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:42,485
ACCUSED MUCH IN THE SAME WAY 

1518
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:44,887
THAT HE SAYS HE HAS BEEN 

1519
00:58:44,887 --> 00:58:46,054
FALSELY ACCUSED WHEN IT COMES 

1520
00:58:46,054 --> 00:58:48,758
TO HIMSELF AND THE DOZENS OF 

1521
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:51,828
WOMEN THAT ACCUSED HIM OF 

1522
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:52,261
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. 

1523
00:58:52,261 --> 00:58:54,530
>> A SYMBOLIC MARTYR FOR THE 

1524
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:54,997
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 

1525
00:58:54,997 --> 00:58:57,233
THIS IS A RALLYING CALL FOR 

1526
00:58:57,233 --> 00:59:00,103
REPUBLICAN VOTERS AHEAD OF THE 

1527
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:00,570
CRITICAL MIDTERMS. 

1528
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,871
THE POLLING REFLECTS THATED 

1529
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,273
KAVANAUGH ISSUE HELPED THEM 

1530
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:05,475
CLOSE THE ENTHUSIASM GAP AND 

1531
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:07,276
THE PRESIDENT HAS SIZED ON 

1532
00:59:07,276 --> 00:59:07,476
THIS. 

1533
00:59:07,476 --> 00:59:08,878
ON WEDNESDAY HE TWEETED 

1534
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,279
SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING. 

1535
00:59:10,279 --> 00:59:12,915
HE NOTED THERE WAS MORE 

1536
00:59:12,915 --> 00:59:16,019
ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY FOR THE 

1537
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:16,986
UPCOMING MIDTERMS BECAUSE OF 

1538
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:19,889
WHAT MANY PEOPLE PERCEIVE AS AN 

1539
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,391
ATTACK ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

1540
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,126
THEIR ARGUMENT IS DEMOCRATS 

1541
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:26,929
DON'T LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP WON 

1542
00:59:26,929 --> 00:59:29,032
THE A HELP ECONOMICS -- AND 

1543
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:29,832
DON'T LIKE JUDGE KAVANAUGH, HE 

1544
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:33,136
IS IN COULD HOOTS WITH THE 

1545
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:34,470
PRESS AND BROAD CONSPIRACY 

1546
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,506
AGAINST HIS AGENDA AND JUDGE 

1547
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,808
KAVANAUGH IS BEING PUNISHED. 

1548
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:39,842
HE USED THIS SUCCESSFULLY. 

1549
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:41,477
YESTERDAY MORNING HE TALKED 

1550
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:43,279
ABOUT HOW UNFAIRLY, HARSH THE 

1551
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:44,614
TREATMENT OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

1552
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:48,184
HAS BEEN AND IS TALKING ABOUT 

1553
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,887
HOW IT'S AN INCREDIBLE UPWARD 

1554
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:51,287
IMPACT ON VOTERS. 

1555
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:53,990
HE IS TRYING TO SEIZE ON THE 

1556
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:54,323
CONTROVERSY. 

1557
00:59:54,323 --> 00:59:56,158
THIS HAS NOT GONE THE WAY 

1558
00:59:56,158 --> 00:59:57,126
REPUBLICANS HAD EXPECTED OR 

1559
00:59:57,126 --> 00:59:58,628
HOPED, THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE 

1560
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:00,029
UPSIDE THAT THIS MAY BE WHAT 

1561
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:02,331
THEY NEED TO HELP THEM IN THE 

1562
01:00:02,331 --> 01:00:02,932
MIDTERMS. 

1563
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:03,933
>> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 

1564
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,634
REPUBLICANS, TRYING TO TURN 

1565
01:00:05,634 --> 01:00:07,070
DEMOCRATS TO TRY TO GET A 

1566
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,404
LARGER MARGIN BUT I'M WONDERING 

1567
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:11,240
IF YOU ARE HEARING ANYTHING 

1568
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:11,975
ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS? 

1569
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:13,276
WE HAVE REPORTING ABOUT DIANE 

1570
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,377
FEINSTEIN LEAVING THE SENATE 

1571
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:16,012
CHAMBERS SAYING THIS WAS A 

1572
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:18,481
MISTAKE AND SHE WAS ASKED IF 

1573
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:19,982
SHE WAS CONFIDENT THAT 

1574
01:00:19,982 --> 01:00:21,184
DEMOCRATS COULD DEFEAT 

1575
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:21,484
KAVANAUGH. 

1576
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:22,785
SHE SAID I DON'T KNOW. 

1577
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,687
I IMAGINE THE DEMOCRATS ARE 

1578
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:26,689
BUSY AS WELL BEHIND THE SCENES. 

1579
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:27,089
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

1580
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:28,391
THE WHITE HOUSE IS STILL 

1581
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:29,959
WORKING ON SOME RED STATE 

1582
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,928
DEMOCRATS THAT SAID THEY WILL 

1583
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,830
VOTE NO TRYING TO PUSH THEM. 

1584
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:34,397
PARTICULARLY JOE MANCHIN. 

1585
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:35,798
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE IN A 

1586
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,600
SITUATION WHERE HE IS THE 

1587
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:37,967
DECIDING VOTE. 

1588
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,368
HE DOESN'T WANT THAT STICKING 

1589
01:00:39,368 --> 01:00:39,836
TO HIM. 

1590
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:41,504
THEY THINK THEY COULD BE ABLE 

1591
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:44,807
TO FLIP HIM AND GET HIM TO VOTE 

1592
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:45,007
YES. 

1593
01:00:45,007 --> 01:00:45,374
SO, ABSOLUTELY. 

1594
01:00:45,374 --> 01:00:48,277
NO ONE REALLY KNOWS HOW THIS IS 

1595
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:51,080
GOING TO TURN OUT THE NEXT 24 

1596
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,082
OR I GUESS SPECIFICALLY 30 

1597
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:53,382
HOURS. 

1598
01:00:53,382 --> 01:00:55,485
WE HAVE UNTIL THIS VOTE BUT 

1599
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,419
RIGHT NOW THEY ARE CONFIDENT 

1600
01:00:57,419 --> 01:00:58,220
AND WORKING THE PHONES. 

1601
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,822
>> KAITLYN I WAS THINKING ABOUT 

1602
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,392
THE VOTE AS IT MOVES FORWARD. 

1603
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:04,527
WE TALKED ABOUT GETTING A 

1604
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:05,228
CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE, ANOTHER 

1605
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:06,929
CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE ON THE 

1606
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:09,031
SUPREME COURT, PARTICULARLY FOR 

1607
01:01:09,031 --> 01:01:11,834
SOME OF THE TRUMP SUPPORTERS 

1608
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,536
WHO MIGHT NOT TYPICALLY SUPPORT 

1609
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,304
HIM LIKE EVANGELICALS. 

1610
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:17,406
WHAT I HAVE BEEN THINKING, 

1611
01:01:17,406 --> 01:01:18,007
THOUGH, IS THAT SHOULD 

1612
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,209
KAVANAUGH MAKE IT TO THE 

1613
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:27,483
SUPREME COURT, THAT WOULD BE 

1614
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:28,584
TWO CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES. 

1615
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:29,786
THEN WHAT MOTIVATION DO 

1616
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:30,920
EVANGELICALS HAVE TO CONTINUE 

1617
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,522
TO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP. 

1618
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,990
THEY ARE GETTING WHAT THEY 

1619
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,290
WANT. 

1620
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,192
THEN THERE IS HIS PERSONAL, 

1621
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:37,860
SOME OF HIS BEHAVIOR, NOT 

1622
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,628
EXACTLY CHRISTIAN LIKE. 

1623
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:42,832
>> I SPENT LAST WEEK TALKING TO 

1624
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:44,033
VARIOUS EVANGELICAL LEADERS IN 

1625
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,835
VARIOUS PLACES AROUND THE 

1626
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:46,702
COUNTRY ABOUT KAVANAUGH. 

1627
01:01:46,702 --> 01:01:47,836
WHAT I WAS HEARING MORE OFTEN, 

1628
01:01:47,836 --> 01:01:50,640
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE SUPREME 

1629
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,774
COURT WHICH IS CRITICALLY 

1630
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:53,776
IMPORTANT THIS THEM BUT ABOUT 

1631
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:54,643
TWO OTHER THINGS. 

1632
01:01:54,643 --> 01:01:56,913
FIRST OF ALL, JUDGESHIPS ACROSS 

1633
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:57,880
THE COUNTRY, WHICH THE 

1634
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,117
REPUBLICAN SENATE HAS BEEN KEY 

1635
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:01,417
IN SHAPING. 

1636
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:03,286
THAT IS A KEY ITEM OF INTEREST 

1637
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,388
FOR McCONNELL AND WHAT HE WANTS 

1638
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,390
HIS LEGACY TO BE AND SECOND 

1639
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,792
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING 

1640
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:13,629
FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE 

1641
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:14,430
PERSPECTIVE ON VARIOUS 

1642
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,332
REGULATIONS, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 

1643
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:17,033
REGULATIONS AND THINGS LIKE 

1644
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:17,233
THAT. 

1645
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,634
THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE OF 

1646
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:20,102
DECISIONS THAT THE PRESIDENT 

1647
01:02:20,102 --> 01:02:21,771
HAS MADE FROM AN ADMINISTRATION 

1648
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:24,907
STANDPOINT THAT THEY ARE STILL 

1649
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:25,374
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. 

1650
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:29,312
THEN, OF COURSE, THERE IS THE 

1651
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:29,946
POTENTIAL FOR POSSIBLY ANOTHER 

1652
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:32,515
SUPREME COURT OPENING IN THE 

1653
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:33,115
NEXT TWO YEARS. 

1654
01:02:33,115 --> 01:02:33,816
>> RIGHT. 

1655
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:35,284
SO, THEY JUST KIND OF LIKE WHAT 

1656
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:37,587
THEY ARE SEEING IS WHAT I AM 

1657
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:38,521
HEARING FROM THEM AND IT'S 

1658
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:38,788
CRITICAL. 

1659
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:40,690
THESE ARE FOLKS THAT HAVE THE 

1660
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,925
POWER TO GALVANIZE PEOPLE TO 

1661
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,060
TURN OUT TO VOTE. 

1662
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,027
THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED IT IN 

1663
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:45,227
2016. 

1664
01:02:45,227 --> 01:02:46,562
THEY ARE STILL ON HIS SIDE AND 

1665
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:48,531
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WILL TRY 

1666
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:50,933
TO KEEP THAT UP BY SAYING, LOOK 

1667
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,735
WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF DEMOCRATS 

1668
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:53,035
TAKE OVER. 

1669
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:54,103
EVERYTHING THAT YOU WANTED AND 

1670
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,305
THAT YOU WORKED FOR AND FOUGHT 

1671
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:57,940
FOR ON THIS NOMINATION COULD BE 

1672
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:58,307
AT STAKE. 

1673
01:02:58,307 --> 01:03:00,209
SO, THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING 

1674
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:01,778
THAT THEY WANT TO HEAR FROM 

1675
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:02,545
DONALD TRUMP. 

1676
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:03,212
>> THAT IS INTERESTING. 

1677
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:06,315
>> PAULA, BEFORE WE LET YOU GO, 

1678
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:08,517
THE PRESIDENT WAS IN MINNESOTA 

1679
01:03:08,517 --> 01:03:09,418
YESTERDAY AND, YOU KNOW, THERE 

1680
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:11,220
WAS OCCUR USE MOMENT WHEN HE 

1681
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,022
WAS SPEAKING TO HIS SUPPORTERS 

1682
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:15,691
AT THIS RALLY WHERE HE BROUGHT 

1683
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:17,927
UP THE NAME OF SENATOR AL 

1684
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:20,563
FRANKEN WHO, AS YOU KNOW, WAS 

1685
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:21,230
ESSENTIALLY REMOVED FROM THE 

1686
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:21,631
SENATE. 

1687
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,533
HE RESIGNED HIS POSITION AS A 

1688
01:03:24,533 --> 01:03:25,635
SENATOR BECAUSE OF SEXUAL 

1689
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,036
MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS AND THE 

1690
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:30,072
PRESIDENT, IT FELT TO ME, AS IF 

1691
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:31,707
THE PRESIDENT WAS SORT OF 

1692
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:33,175
MOCKING SENATOR FRANKEN NOT 

1693
01:03:33,175 --> 01:03:35,111
BECAUSE OF THE WRONGDOING BUT 

1694
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,412
BECAUSE HE CHOSE TO BACK DOWN 

1695
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,514
AND AS WE KNOW IN PRESIDENT 

1696
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,082
TRUMP'S WORLD YOU NEVER DO 

1697
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:40,516
THAT. 

1698
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:40,816
>> EXACTLY. 

1699
01:03:40,816 --> 01:03:42,919
NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE 

1700
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:44,720
ALLEGATIONS BUT HOW HE HANDED 

1701
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:44,920
THEM. 

1702
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,389
HE FOLDED TO USE THE 

1703
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:47,290
PRESIDENT'S TERM AND CRITICIZED 

1704
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:50,526
HIM FOR NOT DOING WHAT IS HIS 

1705
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:52,261
TRADITIONAL PLAYBOOK, WHEN YOU 

1706
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:54,130
ARE FACED WITH THESE 

1707
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,332
ACCUSATIONS, DENY, DENY, DENY 

1708
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,766
AND FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT. 

1709
01:03:57,766 --> 01:03:59,035
THAT EXPLAINS SOME OF JUDGE 

1710
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:00,569
KAVANAUGH'S COMPOSURE THAT WE 

1711
01:04:00,569 --> 01:04:02,671
SAW IN THE HEARING. 

1712
01:04:02,671 --> 01:04:03,706
HE SAID I WAS MORE EMOTIONAL 

1713
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:06,575
THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN BUT A LOT 

1714
01:04:06,575 --> 01:04:08,411
OF PEOPLE SAW THAT HEARING AS 

1715
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:09,544
FOR AN AUDIENCE OF ONE. 

1716
01:04:09,544 --> 01:04:10,613
HE NEEDED TO PROVE TO THE 

1717
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,648
PRESIDENT THAT HE WAS WILLING 

1718
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:15,051
TO FIGHT FOR HIS NOMINATION AND 

1719
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:16,986
THE PRESIDENT'S LEGACY AT STAKE 

1720
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:18,921
FOR ANY SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 

1721
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:19,355
NOMINEE. 

1722
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:20,189
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THE 

1723
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,791
PRESIDENT TOOK JABS AT SOMEBODY 

1724
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:24,326
WHO TOOK A DIFFERENT APPROACH 

1725
01:04:24,326 --> 01:04:26,028
WHEN FACED WITH THOSE KINDS OF 

1726
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:26,762
ACCUSATIONS. 

1727
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:28,130
>> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 

1728
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,832
EMOTIONAL PRESENTATION BEING 

1729
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:30,933
FOR AN AUDIENCE OF ONE. 

1730
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:33,769
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS OP-ED 

1731
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:37,173
WHERE HE SORT OF APOLOGIZED FOR 

1732
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:38,107
BEING EMOTIONAL FOR AN AUDIENCE 

1733
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:39,274
OF 100 OR SO. 

1734
01:04:39,274 --> 01:04:40,910
>> THE QUESTION IS, THERE WERE 

1735
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:43,312
REPORTS, PAULA, THAT THE WHITE 

1736
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:45,114
HOUSE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS 

1737
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:48,017
SORT OF BRETT KAVANAUGH GOING 

1738
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:49,017
OFF THE RESERVATION ONCE AGAIN. 

1739
01:04:49,017 --> 01:04:51,821
>> MANY PEOPLE SEE IT AS A 

1740
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:52,221
CLOSING ARGUMENT. 

1741
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,423
PERHAPSWE ARE AT AN AUDIENCE 

1742
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:56,492
OF FOUR CRITICAL VOTES RIGHT 

1743
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:56,692
NOW. 

1744
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:59,061
I THINK YOU SAW HIS TESTIMONY 

1745
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,230
BEFORE CONGRESS AS AN OPENING 

1746
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,531
ARGUMENT, AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE OF 

1747
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:03,332
HIMSELF, DEFENDING HIMSELF 

1748
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,134
TRYING NOT ONLY IN THE EYES OF 

1749
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:08,204
THE PRESIDENT BUT TRYING TO 

1750
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:08,804
PRESERVE HIS REPUTATION. 

1751
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:10,106
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK OUT, HE 

1752
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:12,908
GOES BACK TO BEING A FEDERAL 

1753
01:05:12,908 --> 01:05:13,309
JUDGE. 

1754
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:14,643
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT 

1755
01:05:14,643 --> 01:05:19,715
THIS IS ON DR. FORD AND JUDGE 

1756
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:20,015
KAVANAUGH. 

1757
01:05:20,015 --> 01:05:21,817
HE WROTE AN OP-ED, SOBER 

1758
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,285
WALKING BACK HOW HE HANDLED IT. 

1759
01:05:23,285 --> 01:05:24,220
PERHAPS HE WATCHED "SNL" OVER 

1760
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,955
THE WEEKEND AND THOUGHT A LOT 

1761
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:28,591
OF THIS WASN'T MADE UP BY THE 

1762
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,760
WRITERS, I ACTUALLY SAID THOSE 

1763
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:30,993
THINGS. 

1764
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:32,795
THIS IS A CLOSING AUDIENCE, NOT 

1765
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:33,863
NECESSARILY BEFORE AN AUDIENCE 

1766
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:34,130
OF ONE. 

1767
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,931
THIS TIME IT WAS BEFORE THE 

1768
01:05:35,931 --> 01:05:37,633
FOUR CRITICAL VOTES THAT COULD 

1769
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:39,568
HELP HIM GET CONFIRMED TO THE 

1770
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:41,303
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND. 

1771
01:05:41,303 --> 01:05:42,705
>> WHAT PAULA SAID IS THAT HE 

1772
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:44,373
MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY, IF THIS 

1773
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:46,208
DIDN'T WORK OUT HE HAS TO GO TO 

1774
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:46,709
HIS OTHER JOB. 

1775
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,811
WE KNOW SO MUCH MORE ABOUT HIS 

1776
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:49,111
LIFE. 

1777
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:52,515
CAN YOU IMAGINE BRINGING A CASE 

1778
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:53,015
IN FRONT OF HIM? 

1779
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:55,618
HOW OFTEN WILL HE HEAR YOU MAY 

1780
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,719
HAVE TO RECUSE YOURSELF BECAUSE 

1781
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,420
OF SOMETHING WE LEARNED ABOUT 

1782
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,789
YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL. 

1783
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:01,724
>> THAT'S AN ARGUMENT THAT MANY 

1784
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:04,160
ARE MAKING BASED ON HIS 

1785
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:04,827
PERFORMANCE DURING THE HEARING. 

1786
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:06,462
PAULA REID, AT THE WHITE HOUSE, 

1787
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:06,762
THANK YOU. 

1788
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:11,667
WE WILL TALK TO YOU IN A BIT. 

1789
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,903
NANCY CORDES IS STANDING BY ON 

1790
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:15,938
THE HILL. 

1791
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:17,006
BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THE 

1792
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:18,541
DYNAMICS WE WITNESSED ON THE 

1793
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:21,410
FLOOR OF THE SENATE, WE WERE 

1794
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,312
TALKING ABOUT THIS OP-ED THAT 

1795
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:27,016
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WROTE, SOME 

1796
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:28,717
ENTER RED THE OP-ED -- 

1797
01:06:28,717 --> 01:06:29,718
INTERPRETED THE OP-ED AS A PLEA 

1798
01:06:29,718 --> 01:06:33,823
OR ATTEMPT TO SPEAK TO THE 

1799
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:37,426
SENATORS THAT WERE APPALLED BY 

1800
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:39,261
HIS BEHAVIOR DURING THE 

1801
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:40,062
JUDICIARY HEARING INCLUDING 

1802
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:41,563
SENATORS FLAKE AND PERHAPS 

1803
01:06:41,563 --> 01:06:41,963
SENATOR COLLINS. 

1804
01:06:41,963 --> 01:06:43,632
>> A RECOGNITION ON HIS PART 

1805
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:45,468
THAT HE NEEDED TO DO SOME 

1806
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:45,934
DAMAGE CONTROL. 

1807
01:06:45,934 --> 01:06:48,537
WHAT HAPPENS HE NEEDED TO SEND 

1808
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:50,806
A MESSAGE THAT HE UNDERSTOOD 

1809
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:52,875
HIS TEMPERAMENT IN THAT 

1810
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:55,511
HEARING, WHEN HE SNAPPED AT A 

1811
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,179
FEW SENATORS, WHEN HE DESCRIBED 

1812
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,814
THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM BY 

1813
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:02,618
THE TWO WOMEN AS PART OF SOME 

1814
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:05,855
KIND OF DEMOCRATIC CLINTON LED 

1815
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,655
CONSPIRACY OR PERHAPS NOT THE 

1816
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:08,324
TYPE OF COMMENTS THAT YOU WOULD 

1817
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:09,859
TYPICALLY EXPECT TO COME FROM 

1818
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,160
SOMEONE WHO IS LOOKING TO SIT 

1819
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:15,431
ON THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE 

1820
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:16,031
LAND. 

1821
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:19,368
SO, HE WROTE THAT VERY 

1822
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:19,901
CAREFULLY WORDED OP-ED. 

1823
01:07:19,901 --> 01:07:20,803
HE DIDN'T NECESSARILY APOLOGIZE 

1824
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:21,904
FOR THOSE COMMENTS BUT 

1825
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:23,005
ACKNOWLEDGED THEM AND SAID THAT 

1826
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:24,607
PERHAPS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT 

1827
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:26,408
HE SAID CROSSED THE LINE BUT IT 

1828
01:07:26,408 --> 01:07:28,343
WAS ALL BECAUSE HE FELT SO 

1829
01:07:28,343 --> 01:07:30,112
STRONGLY THAT HE WAS BEING 

1830
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:31,380
STRONGLY ACCUSED AND THAT HE 

1831
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,616
WAS THINKING ABOUT HIS FAMILY 

1832
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:39,221
AND HOW THEY MUST FEEL AT THIS 

1833
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:39,454
MOMENT. 

1834
01:07:39,454 --> 01:07:40,756
JEFF FLAKE, SUSAN COLLINS, LISA 

1835
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:41,891
MURKOWSKI NEVER CAME OUT AND 

1836
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,260
DIRECTLY SAID THAT THEY HAVE 

1837
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,861
DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT HIS 

1838
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:47,062
TEMPERAMENT BASED ON THE WAY 

1839
01:07:47,062 --> 01:07:51,367
THAT HE CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN 

1840
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:51,700
THE HEARING. 

1841
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,335
IN FACT, JEFF FLAKE SAID ON 60 

1842
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:55,104
MINUTES THAT HE MIGHT FEEL THE 

1843
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:58,207
SAME WAY IF HE FELT HE WAS 

1844
01:07:58,207 --> 01:08:00,009
WRONGLY ACCUSED AND WOULD BE 

1845
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:02,111
ANGRY AND UNDERSTOOD WHERE THAT 

1846
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:02,711
PASSION CAME FROM. 

1847
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:04,513
BUT, THIS IS SOMEONE THAT IS 

1848
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:08,150
THINKING NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING 

1849
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:10,619
CONFIRMED BUT THINKING ABOUT 

1850
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:11,920
HIS REPUTATION AS HE MOVES 

1851
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,922
TOWARD SITTING ON THE SUPREME 

1852
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,591
COURT AND HOW HE WILL BE 

1853
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:15,824
VIEWED. 

1854
01:08:15,824 --> 01:08:17,359
HOW MUCH TRUST PEOPLE CAN PLACE 

1855
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:17,859
IN HIS DECISIONS. 

1856
01:08:17,859 --> 01:08:19,060
HOW MUCH TRUST PEOPLE CAN HAVE 

1857
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:21,831
IN THE FACT THAT HE WILL BE AN 

1858
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:22,231
IMPARTIAL JURIST. 

1859
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:24,667
IT SEEMS THAT HE HAD ALL OF 

1860
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:29,705
THAT IN MIND WHEN HE WROTE THE 

1861
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:29,938
OP-ED. 

1862
01:08:29,938 --> 01:08:32,408
>> NANCY, IT'S KAITLYN. 

1863
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:33,809
WE ARE WATCHING SUSAN COLLINS 

1864
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:36,011
AND LISA MURKOWSKI THE PAST TWO 

1865
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:36,645
WEEKS. 

1866
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:38,113
BOTH VOTED DEFINITELY. 

1867
01:08:38,113 --> 01:08:39,715
DO YOU THINK THAT COLLINS HAS 

1868
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:42,718
ANY CHANCE OF VOTING NO ON 

1869
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:43,385
FINAL PASSAGE? 

1870
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:46,622
SHE SAID SHE WILL MAKE AN 

1871
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:47,256
ANNOUNCEMENT AT 3:00 TODAY. 

1872
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:49,158
AND MURKOWSKI, TALK ABOUT WHAT 

1873
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:51,060
IT'S LIKE FOR HER AND WHAT 

1874
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,761
FACTORED INTO HER DECISION 

1875
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:55,064
TODAY BEING THE ONLY REPUBLICAN 

1876
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:58,466
TO VOTE NO ON THROW TUR. 

1877
01:08:58,466 --> 01:09:00,069
>> IT WAS -- CLOTURE. 

1878
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:02,303
>> I WAS THERE IN THE CHAMBER. 

1879
01:09:02,303 --> 01:09:03,805
THEY SIT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. 

1880
01:09:03,805 --> 01:09:06,008
THEIR DESKS ARE NEXT TO ONE 

1881
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:06,274
ANOTHER. 

1882
01:09:06,274 --> 01:09:07,209
WHEN MURKOWSKI'S NAME WAS 

1883
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:09,877
CALLED AND SHE SAID NO, SHE 

1884
01:09:09,877 --> 01:09:12,680
SAID IT SO SOFTLY THAT AT FIRST 

1885
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,117
EVERYONE LEANED OVER AND SAID 

1886
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:16,318
WHAT DID SHE SAY? 

1887
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:17,786
AND IT WAS THEN THAT WE 

1888
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:21,890
REALIZED SHE WAS VOTING NO TO 

1889
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:22,825
ADVANCE THE NOMINATION. 

1890
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:24,459
EVEN AFTER SHE DID THAT, 

1891
01:09:24,459 --> 01:09:25,961
COLLINS SITTING NEXT TO HER 

1892
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:26,862
LEANED OVER FROM TIME TO TIME, 

1893
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:29,999
CHATTED WITH HER AS THE REST OF 

1894
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:33,368
THE SENATORS WERE CASTING THEIR 

1895
01:09:33,368 --> 01:09:33,669
VOTES. 

1896
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,870
MURKOWSKI WAS VERY STRAIGHT 

1897
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:38,774
FACED, SORT OF LOOKING AHEAD, 

1898
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:39,374
NOT REGISTERING MUCH EMOTION 

1899
01:09:39,374 --> 01:09:42,411
BUT RIGHT AFTER THE VENTED, 

1900
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:43,812
THIS IS WHAT WAS SO 

1901
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:44,145
FASCINATING. 

1902
01:09:44,145 --> 01:09:47,116
TWO REPUBLICANS CAME UP TO HER 

1903
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:47,416
RIGHT AWAY. 

1904
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:49,818
JOHN CORNYN OF TEXAS AND ROB 

1905
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:52,821
PORTMAN OF OHIO, TWO BIG 

1906
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:53,721
SUPPORTERS OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

1907
01:09:53,721 --> 01:09:56,025
ROB PORTMAN WAS ACTIVELY 

1908
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,926
LOBBYING SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES 

1909
01:09:57,926 --> 01:09:58,727
ON KAVANAUGH'S BEHALF. 

1910
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:01,363
THEY CAME UP TO HER AND SHOOK 

1911
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:05,467
HER HAND AS IF TO SAY NO HARD 

1912
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:05,801
FEELINGS. 

1913
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:07,636
THEN AFTER THEY MOVED ON, MARIA 

1914
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:08,804
CANTWELL A DEMOCRAT FROM 

1915
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:09,438
WASHINGTON STATE WALKED UP, 

1916
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:15,377
HANDED HER A NOTE AND WALKED 

1917
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:15,577
AWAY. 

1918
01:10:15,577 --> 01:10:16,211
TWO OTHER WOMEN, AMY LOBO CHAR 

1919
01:10:16,211 --> 01:10:19,214
CAME UP BIG SMILES TO TALK TO 

1920
01:10:19,214 --> 01:10:20,115
HER. 

1921
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:21,884
SUSAN COLLINS HAD HER ARM 

1922
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,384
AROUND MURKOWSKI'S SHOULDER. 

1923
01:10:23,384 --> 01:10:25,821
WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT HOW SUSAN 

1924
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:27,289
COLLINS WILL VOTE IN THE END I 

1925
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:30,993
DON'T KNOW BECAUSE SHE KEPT US 

1926
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:31,460
IN GREAT SUSPENSION. 

1927
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,162
SHE WAS CLEARLY SENDING A 

1928
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:36,966
SIGNAL THAT SHE UNDERSTANDS 

1929
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:38,133
WHERE MURKOWSKI IS IN THIS 

1930
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:39,902
DEBATE AND CERTAINLY HAS BEEN 

1931
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,071
THERE AT HER SIDE THROUGH SO 

1932
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:45,374
MANY OF THESE TOUGH VOTES AND 

1933
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:46,342
WAS SHOWING HER SUPPORT AGAIN 

1934
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:46,742
TODAY. 

1935
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:50,579
>> NAY SEE, I NOTE THAT IN JOHN 

1936
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,380
NOLAN, YOUR PRODUCER'S NOTE TO 

1937
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:55,684
US, THAT WHEN SENATOR MANCHIN 

1938
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:56,651
VOTED YES, THERE WAS A SLIGHT 

1939
01:10:56,651 --> 01:10:58,721
GASP IN THE CHAMBER WHEN HE 

1940
01:10:58,721 --> 01:10:59,421
VOTED. 

1941
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,824
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THAT? 

1942
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:03,225
>> THERE WAS. 

1943
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:05,727
THE SENSE WAS IF LISA MURKOWSKI 

1944
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:07,463
WOULD VOTE NO PERHAPS MANCHIN 

1945
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:08,964
WOULD VOTE NO AS WELL. 

1946
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:11,667
HE DID A GREAT JOB OF KEEPING 

1947
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:12,434
EVERYONE IN SUSPENSION. 

1948
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:15,704
WE SPOKE TO HIM A SHORT TIME 

1949
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:16,104
BEFORE THE VOTE. 

1950
01:11:16,104 --> 01:11:18,307
HE WAS STILL UNDECIDED. 

1951
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:20,676
WE WERE LED TO BELIEVE THAT HIS 

1952
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:24,113
VOTE HERE JUST TO ADVANCE THE 

1953
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,415
NOMINATION WOULD MOST LIKELY 

1954
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:28,417
MIRROR HIS VOTE TOMORROW FOR 

1955
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:28,750
CONFIRMATION. 

1956
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:30,919
THAT IS TYPICALLY HOW HE LIKES 

1957
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:34,689
TO HANDLE THESE THINGS. 

1958
01:11:34,689 --> 01:11:36,925
WE DON'T KNOW FORESURE. 

1959
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:41,163
THAT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN -- WE 

1960
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:42,664
DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. 

1961
01:11:42,664 --> 01:11:43,231
THAT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN. 

1962
01:11:43,231 --> 01:11:45,367
I WILL ADVANCE THE NOMINATION 

1963
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:48,670
AND THAT WILL BUY ME ANOTHER 24 

1964
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:50,239
HOURS TO DECIDE HOW I FEEL. 

1965
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,206
HIS AIDES HAVE TWO STATEMENTS 

1966
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:52,341
WRITTEN UP AND THEY ARE WAITING 

1967
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:55,310
TO GET THE WORD FROM HIM ON 

1968
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:57,880
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO BEFORE THEY 

1969
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,014
RELEASE ONE STATEMENT OR THE 

1970
01:11:59,014 --> 01:11:59,247
OTHER. 

1971
01:11:59,247 --> 01:12:01,517
SO, HE CLEARLY HAS GONE BACK 

1972
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:02,317
AND FORTH AND BELIEVES THAT 

1973
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:03,885
THERE ARE STRONG ARGUMENTS TO 

1974
01:12:03,885 --> 01:12:06,221
BE MADE ON BOTH SIDES. 

1975
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:07,055
>> SO FASCINATING. 

1976
01:12:07,055 --> 01:12:09,725
>> DOES THAT MEAN THAT WE WILL 

1977
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:10,425
SEE DEMOCRATS LIKE DIANE 

1978
01:12:10,425 --> 01:12:13,194
FEINSTEIN PICKING UP THE PHONE, 

1979
01:12:13,194 --> 01:12:15,063
GOING TO PEOPLE'S OFFICES -- IS 

1980
01:12:15,063 --> 01:12:16,965
THIS GOING TO BE COMING DOWN TO 

1981
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:17,766
THE WIRE? 

1982
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:21,437
>> WHEN IT COMES TO JOE MANCHIN 

1983
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:22,404
THINGS ARE TRICKY FOR 

1984
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:22,737
DEMOCRATS. 

1985
01:12:22,737 --> 01:12:25,541
AS DICK DURBIN PUT IT THIS 

1986
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:26,942
MORNING, THE TYPICAL PUTTING 

1987
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:29,211
THE SCREWS TO SOMEONE, IT 

1988
01:12:29,211 --> 01:12:29,644
DOESN'T QUITE WORK. 

1989
01:12:29,644 --> 01:12:31,013
IN FACT, DEMOCRATS LEARNED THE 

1990
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:34,416
HARD WAY IF YOU PUT TOO MUCH 

1991
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:35,717
PRESSURE ON JOE MANCHIN WHO HAS 

1992
01:12:35,717 --> 01:12:37,685
AN INDEPENDENT STREAK SOMETIMES 

1993
01:12:37,685 --> 01:12:41,023
IT CAN BACK FIRE AND HE CAN GET 

1994
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,624
FRUSTRATED AND GOT OTHER WAY. 

1995
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:47,429
THEY HAVE TAKEN A HANDS OFF 

1996
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:47,863
APPROACH. 

1997
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:48,764
HEY REALIZE THAT HE IS  

1998
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:52,568
-- HE IS REALLY WEIGHING HIS 

1999
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:54,736
OPTIONS AND SHIFTING THROUGH 

2000
01:12:54,736 --> 01:12:56,905
BOTH THE POLITICAL ARGUMENTS, 

2001
01:12:56,905 --> 01:13:01,610
THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE SUPREME 

2002
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,846
COURT, ABOUT KAVANAUGH HIMSELF, 

2003
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:05,314
THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE SEXUAL 

2004
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:06,215
ASSAULT ALLEGATION AND THAT IT 

2005
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:09,017
REALLY WON'T DO THEM MUCH GOOD 

2006
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:11,220
TO TRY TO FORCE HIM OFF THE 

2007
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,021
FENCE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER NO 

2008
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:15,023
MATTER HOW BADLY THEY WOULD 

2009
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:17,058
LIKE TO KNOW WHERE HE STANDS. 

2010
01:13:17,058 --> 01:13:18,694
>> WE CAN REMEMBER THAT 

2011
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:21,363
PHOTOGRAPH SNAPPED BY THE 

2012
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:23,332
CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER FROM CBS 

2013
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:25,801
NEWS, IS THE PICTURE OF SENATOR 

2014
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:28,136
FEINSTEIN WITH HER ARM THERE 

2015
01:13:28,136 --> 01:13:28,904
TALKING TO SENATOR MURKOWSKI. 

2016
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:32,841
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW WHAT 

2017
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:33,208
WAS BEING SAID. 

2018
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:33,474
>> RIGHT. 

2019
01:13:33,474 --> 01:13:35,644
WE KNOW HOW STRONGLY FEINSTEIN 

2020
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:39,047
FELT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS 

2021
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:41,950
CALLING IT A MISTAKE, THIS 

2022
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:42,618
NARROW 49-51 TO ADVANCE THE 

2023
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:42,918
NOMINATION. 

2024
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:45,320
SHE HAS BEEN AT THE CENTER OF 

2025
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:45,620
THE STORM. 

2026
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:48,757
THERE IS STILL BIG QUESTIONS 

2027
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:49,524
ABOUT HOW THIS ANONYMOUS LETTER 

2028
01:13:49,524 --> 01:13:52,361
FROM CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD MADE 

2029
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:53,495
IT INTO THE PUBLIC EYE. 

2030
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:55,197
AND SHE HASN'T -- SHE DOESN'T 

2031
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:57,065
HAVE CLEAR ANSWERS ABOUT THAT 

2032
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:59,367
ASIDE FROM SAYING THAT SHE 

2033
01:13:59,367 --> 01:14:01,904
HERSELF AND HER OFFICE DIDN'T 

2034
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:02,171
LEAK IT. 

2035
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:04,005
YOU KNOW, THESE ARE WOMEN -- I 

2036
01:14:04,005 --> 01:14:05,874
SHOULD POINT OUT EVEN THOUGH 

2037
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:09,344
THEY ARE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF 

2038
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:12,548
THE AISLE, THE WOMEN OF THE 

2039
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:15,150
SENATE MEET ROUTINELY AND TALK 

2040
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:16,251
AMONG THEMSELVES DEMOCRATS AND 

2041
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:16,652
REPUBLICANS. 

2042
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,720
THEY WORK TOGETHER, THEY TAKE 

2043
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,855
PRIDE IN WORKING TOGETHER. 

2044
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:22,458
THEY TAKE PRIDE IN SHOWING THE 

2045
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,360
MEN HOW CAPABLE THE TWO SIDES 

2046
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:29,565
ARE OF WORKING TOGETHER, EVEN 

2047
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:30,599
THROUGH DIFFICULT ISSUES. 

2048
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:31,232
SO, FEINSTEIN AND MURKOWSKI 

2049
01:14:31,232 --> 01:14:33,101
HAVE A VERY LONG RELATIONSHIP 

2050
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:35,737
WHERE THEY PROBABLY FEEL THAT 

2051
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:37,539
THEY CAN BE BLUNT WITH ONE 

2052
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:37,806
ANOTHER. 

2053
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:38,440
>> ALL RIGHT. 

2054
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:43,045
NANCY CORDES YOU ARE ON THE 

2055
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:43,378
HILL FOR US. 

2056
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:45,881
OUR VIEWERS WATCHING, SENATOR 

2057
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:47,449
JOHN CORNYN IS MAKING A SPEECH, 

2058
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:49,551
I'M SURE IN ASSISTANCE DEFENSE 

2059
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:51,953
OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH BUT IT'S 

2060
01:14:51,953 --> 01:14:53,455
INTERESTING THAT THE MAJORITY 

2061
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:56,959
WIP WHOSE JOB IT IS TO WHIP 

2062
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:58,260
THE VOTES WALKED OVER TO 

2063
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:01,797
SENATOR MURKOWSKI TO THANK HER. 

2064
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:03,765
THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORTING. 

2065
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:04,132
APPRECIATE IT. 

2066
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:04,867
>> YOU'RE WELCOME. 

2067
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:06,034
>> WE STILL HAVE MOLLIE HOOPER 

2068
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:06,568
I BELIEVE ON THE PHONE. 

2069
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:09,737
I DON'T KNOW IF WE ARE GOING TO 

2070
01:15:09,737 --> 01:15:12,106
LISTEN TO SENATOR CORNYN OR 

2071
01:15:12,106 --> 01:15:13,709
KEEP DISCUSSING WHAT WE 

2072
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:14,343
WITNESSED 15 MINUTES AGO. 

2073
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:17,246
MOLLIE, WE WILL TALK TO YOU ON 

2074
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:17,879
THE OTHER SIDE. 

2075
01:15:17,879 --> 01:15:22,918
>> SOMEBODY COULD BE DENIED A 

2076
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:24,152
CONFIRMATION BASED ON AN 

2077
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:25,554
UNPROVEN ALLEGATION, I CAN'T 

2078
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:27,456
IMAGINE PEOPLE BEING WILLING TO 

2079
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:30,559
SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO THAT IN 

2080
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:31,125
THE FUTURE. 

2081
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:32,661
IT WOULD BE A DARK DAY FOR THE 

2082
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:35,964
SENATE AND THE UNITED STATES 

2083
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:37,599
AND FOR OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE 

2084
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:42,738
THAT BELIEVES IN A FAIR PROCESS 

2085
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:43,939
AND A CONSTITUTIONAL 

2086
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:44,740
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND 

2087
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:48,744
WHEN AN ALLEGATION IS MADE THAT 

2088
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:49,845
THE PERSON MAKING THAT 

2089
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:53,081
ALLEGATIO ACTUAL HAS TO -- 

2090
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:57,519
ACTUALLY HAS TO COME FORWARD 

2091
01:15:57,519 --> 01:15:58,052
WITH SOME EVIDENCE. 

2092
01:15:58,052 --> 01:15:59,655
A NUMBER OF SENATORS, A 

2093
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:01,790
BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS WANTED THE 

2094
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:04,960
FBI TO CONDUCT A LIMITED 

2095
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:05,527
INVESTIGATION INTO CURRENT 

2096
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:06,695
CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS PENDING. 

2097
01:16:06,695 --> 01:16:08,096
THEY WANTED THE FBI TO 

2098
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:09,798
INTERVIEW INDIVIDUALS LIKE MARK 

2099
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:13,869
JUDGE WHO HAD ALREADY OFFERED A 

2100
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:15,003
SWORN STATEMENT UNDER PENALTY 

2101
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:18,940
OF FELONY AND OTHERS WHO MAY 

2102
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:20,042
HAVE HAD INFORMATION THAT WERE 

2103
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:22,544
IDENTIFIED BY DR. FORD AS BEING 

2104
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:27,749
PRESENT ON THE DAY THAT THIS 

2105
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,083
ALLEGED ACTIVITY TOOK PLACE. 

2106
01:16:29,083 --> 01:16:33,655
THERE WAS NO -- NO 

2107
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:34,856
CONFIRMATION, NO CORROBORATION 

2108
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:35,257
THERE. 

2109
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,692
WAS -- THE PEOPLE SHE SAID WERE 

2110
01:16:37,692 --> 01:16:38,660
THERE AND WERE WITNESSES TO 

2111
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:48,069
WHAT HAPPENED SAID I HAVE NO 

2112
01:16:48,069 --> 01:16:48,770
KNOWLEDGE OF THAT. 

2113
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:49,437
DR. FORD'S BEST FRIEND, LEYLAND 

2114
01:16:49,437 --> 01:16:58,379
KAISER SAID I DON'T KNOW BRETT 

2115
01:16:58,379 --> 01:16:58,679
KAVANAUGH. 

2116
01:16:58,679 --> 01:16:59,080
I NEVER MET HIM. 

2117
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,550
WE ALL HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO 

2118
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:02,184
READ THE CONFIDENTIAL REPORT. 

2119
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:05,287
WE HAVE SEEN WHAT THEY WERE 

2120
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:05,854
INTERVIEWED, WHAT THEY WERE 

2121
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:06,521
ASKED AND ANY DOUBTS PEOPLE MAY 

2122
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:15,263
HAVE HAD SHOULD BE PUT TO REST 

2123
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:17,098
BY WHAT THE CONTENTS REVEALED. 

2124
01:17:17,098 --> 01:17:18,100
THESE FANTASIES OF JUDGE 

2125
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:21,770
KAVANAUGH BEING A HIGH SCHOOL 

2126
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,873
PREDATOR HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AS 

2127
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:25,073
THAT. 

2128
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:36,752
MYTHS.

2129
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:39,588
IT'S NOT BASED ON FACT. 

2130
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:41,857
AS WE KNOW THIS WASN'T DESIGNED 

2131
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:42,791
TO BE A TRUTH FINDING PROCESS. 

2132
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:45,894
THIS WASN'T A SEARCH FOR THE 

2133
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:46,128
TRUTH. 

2134
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:46,828
OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE 

2135
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,731
MADE UP THEIR MIND A LONG TIME 

2136
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:53,802
AGO, SOME BEFORE JUDGE 

2137
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:54,335
KAVANAUGH WAS NOMINATED. 

2138
01:17:54,335 --> 01:17:55,704
THIS WAS MORE OF A -- NOT A 

2139
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:59,207
SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH BUT A 

2140
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:00,174
SEARCH AND DESTROY MISSION. 

2141
01:18:00,174 --> 01:18:01,610
AND OBVIOUSLY AS THEY CONTINUE 

2142
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:06,815
TO MOVE THE GOAL POST CALLING 

2143
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:08,116
FOR MORE DELAYS, MORE 

2144
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:09,117
INVESTIGATIONS, THERE HAVE BEEN 

2145
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:10,886
SEVEN BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS 

2146
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:14,156
BY THE FBI OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

2147
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:15,490
DURING HIS PUBLIC SERVICE. 

2148
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:20,228
THE FBI TALKED TO MORE THAN 150 

2149
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:20,528
WITNESSES. 

2150
01:18:20,528 --> 01:18:23,231
DON'T YOU THINK IF THERE WERE 

2151
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,965
ANYTHING TO THESE OUTRAGEOUS 

2152
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:25,166
ALLEGATIONS THAT SOME OF THAT 

2153
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:30,105
WOULD HAVE COME UP AT SOME 

2154
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:31,940
POINT IN THE SEVEN FBI 

2155
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:34,676
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS THAT 

2156
01:18:34,676 --> 01:18:35,377
HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED? 

2157
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:36,811
BUT OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE 

2158
01:18:36,811 --> 01:18:39,013
AISLE RESIST PUTTING A 

2159
01:18:39,013 --> 01:18:46,655
DEFINITIVE END TO THE PROCESS 

2160
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:48,657
AND UNFORTUNATELY CARING LITTLE 

2161
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:53,261
IF ANY ABOUT THE REPUTATION OF 

2162
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:55,397
SOMEONE THAT DEMONSTRATED HIS 

2163
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:56,164
OUTSTANDING QUALIFICATIONS AND 

2164
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:58,867
COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC SERVICE. 

2165
01:18:58,867 --> 01:19:04,239
I THINK SOME OF THESE ATTACKS 

2166
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,574
HAVE BECOME EXHAUSTIVE, 

2167

OUR COLLEAGUES DON'T SEEM TO 

2169
01:19:09,744 --> 01:19:12,848
REALIZE WHAT THEY HAVE 

2170
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:13,582
UNLEASHED WHEN SENATORS GET 

2171
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,751
COAT HANGARS MAILED TO THEIR 

2172
01:19:16,751 --> 01:19:16,951
HOME. 

2173
01:19:16,951 --> 01:19:18,720
PROTESTERS, PAID PROTESTERS 

2174
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:22,557

CONGRESS. 

2179
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,733
PAID PROTESTERS THAT ONCE THEY 

2180
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:33,001
GET ARRESTED MAKE MORE MONEY 

2181
01:19:33,001 --> 01:19:35,904
FROM THE FUNDERS THAN THEY DO 

2182
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:36,604
IF THEY DON'T GET ARRESTED. 

2183
01:19:36,604 --> 01:19:38,974
THAT IS WHAT HAS BEEN 

2184
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:40,742
UNLEASHED. 

2185
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:43,645
CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY CALLED IT MOB 

2186
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:43,945
RULE. 

2187
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:44,445
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 

2188
01:19:44,445 --> 01:19:47,949
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, DURING 

2189
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:49,351

I AM RELEASING COMMITTEE 

2193
01:19:54,855 --> 01:19:55,423
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

01:19:55,423 --> 01:20:00,195
I KNOW THE RULES PROHIBIT ME 

2195
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:00,562
FROM DOING. 

2196
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:01,797
AND THEY DON'T CARE. 

2197
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,531
IF THERE ARE NO RULES AND NO 

2198
01:20:03,531 --> 01:20:05,233
NORMS, IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH 

2199
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:06,901
RESPECT FOR THIS INSTITUTION 

2200
01:20:06,901 --> 01:20:12,707
AND THE PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES WE 

2201
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:16,077
TOUCH, THIS IS WHAT GETS 

2202
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:16,377
UNLEASHED. 

2203
01:20:16,377 --> 01:20:19,514
I FEEL BADLY FOR DR. FORD IN 

2204
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:19,814
PARTICULAR. 

2205
01:20:19,814 --> 01:20:23,985
SHE WANTED NONE OF THIS THREE 

2206
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:24,686
RING CIRCUS. 

2207
01:20:24,686 --> 01:20:26,187
SHE SENT A LETTER TO THE 

2208
01:20:26,187 --> 01:20:31,526
RANKING MEMBER AND ASKED THAT 

2209
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:32,127
HER IDENTITY REMAIN 

2210
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:32,727
CONFIDENTIAL. 

2211
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:35,030
ONLY TO FIND AFTER THE FIRST 

2212
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:36,431
CONFIRMATION HEARING THAT IT 

2213
01:20:36,431 --> 01:20:37,332
WAS LEAKED TO THE PRESS. 

2214
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:41,236
AND THEN THE PRESS CAME TO TALK 

2215
01:20:41,236 --> 01:20:43,004
TO HER AND I GUESS SHE FIGURED 

2216
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:44,839
SHE HAD NOTHING ELSE -- NO 

2217
01:20:44,839 --> 01:20:46,408
OTER RECOURSE BUT TO TELL HER 

2218
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:49,210
STORY TO THE PRESS ONCE HER 

2219
01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:50,478
WISHES WERE VIOLATED. 

2220
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:52,180
SHE DIDN'T CONSENT TO THAT. 

2221
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,616
SHE DIDN'T AUTHORIZE THE 

2222
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:56,117
RELEASE OF THAT CONFIDENTIAL 

2223
01:20:56,117 --> 01:21:02,891
LETTER WHERE SHE -- TO THE 

2224
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:05,593
PRESS BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. 

2225
01:21:05,593 --> 01:21:05,926
>> ALL RIGHT. 

2226
01:21:05,926 --> 01:21:07,161
YOU ARE LISTENING TO SENATOR 

2227
01:21:07,161 --> 01:21:10,498
JOHN CORNYN OF TEXAS. 

2228
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:12,534
HE IS MAKING THE CASE WHY HE 

2229
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,536
BELIEVES THAT JUDGE BRETT 

2230
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:16,504
KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE -- ADVANCED 

2231
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:17,238
TO THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE 

2232
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:19,941
LAND, THE SUPREME COURT OF THE 

2233
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:20,341
UNITED STATES. 

2234
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:21,943
HE SHOULD BE MADE AN ASSOCIATE 

2235
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:22,911
JUSTICE. 

2236
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:25,880
NOW WE WILL SHOW YOU WHAT IS 

2237
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,882
HAPPENING JUST OUTSIDE OF THE 

2238
01:21:27,882 --> 01:21:29,183
CAPITAL WHERE YOU CAN SEE -- 

2239
01:21:29,183 --> 01:21:30,985
>> NOW WE HAVE POLICE OFFICERS. 

2240
01:21:30,985 --> 01:21:33,121
THERE WERE PROTESTERS UP AND 

2241
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:33,554
DOWN THE HALLWAY. 

2242
01:21:33,554 --> 01:21:38,259
WE ARE TOLD SOME OF THEM ARE 

2243
01:21:38,259 --> 01:21:39,561
BEING ARRESTED. 

2244
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,563
THERE HAVE BEEN PROTESTERS 

2245
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:42,764
THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING AND 

2246
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:43,765
THROUGHOUT OUTSIDE, PROTESTERS 

2247
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:44,966
TAKEN TO THE STREETS YESTERDAY 

2248
01:21:44,966 --> 01:21:46,267
BUT PARTICULARLY IN THE 

2249
01:21:46,267 --> 01:21:48,436
BUILDING WHERE THEY CAN GET 

2250
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:49,537
CLOSER TO SOME OF THESE 

2251
01:21:49,537 --> 01:21:49,804
SENATORS. 

2252
01:21:49,804 --> 01:21:51,005
YOU KNOW, IT MADE A DIFFERENCE. 

2253
01:21:51,005 --> 01:21:53,141
PART OF THE REASON WHY THIS 

2254
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:54,709
VOTE IS HAPPENING NOW AND 

2255
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:57,879
HASN'T ALREADY HAPPENED IS 

2256
01:21:57,879 --> 01:21:59,347
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, SOME 

2257
01:21:59,347 --> 01:22:00,715
DEMONSTRATORS TALKED TO SENATOR 

2258
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:04,719
JEFF FLAKE AND CONVINCE HIM, AT 

2259
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,521
LEAST THAT AN FBI -- AN 

2260
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:09,624
ADDITIONAL PROBE BY THE FBI WAS 

2261
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:09,857
WANTED. 

2262
01:22:09,857 --> 01:22:11,126
AND, SO, THEY ARE CLEARLY 

2263
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:16,197
CONTINUING TO KEEP THE PRESSURE 

2264
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:17,165
UP AS THE PROCESS MOVES 

2265
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:17,766
FORWARD. 

2266
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:19,867
>> MOLLIE HOOPER JOINS US. 

2267
01:22:19,867 --> 01:22:20,969
SHE IS A CBSN CONTRIBUTOR AND 

2268
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:21,836
WRITES FOR THE HILL. 

2269
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:23,405
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS 

2270
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:26,574
INTERESTING IS TO KEEP ALL THIS 

2271
01:22:26,574 --> 01:22:27,876
IN PERSPECTIVE. 

2272
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:29,811
SENATOR FLAKE, IN YOU WANT TO 

2273
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:31,913
BELIEVE HIS SENTIMENTS AND THE 

2274
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:37,919
INTERVIEWS THAT HE GAVE TO 60 

2275
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:40,555
MINUTES WITH SENATOR CHRIS WAS 

2276
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:41,823
MOVED BY THE INDIVIDUALS THAT 

2277
01:22:41,823 --> 01:22:44,025
CAME TO HIM AND ASKED HIM TO 

2278
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:45,660
LOOK INTO HIS HEART HUMAN TO 

2279
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:55,103
HUMAN AND MAKE A DECISION BASED 

2280
01:22:55,103 --> 01:23:00,408
ON THE VERY REAL THINGS THAT 

2281
01:23:00,408 --> 01:23:00,674
HAPPENED. 

2282
01:23:00,674 --> 01:23:03,712
THEN YOU HAVE SENATOR HATCH 

2283
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:09,217
THAT WENT THROUGH THIS WITH 

2284
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:11,319
SENATOR THOMAS AND -- CLARENCE 

2285
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:12,520
THOMAS AND ANITA HILL. 

2286
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,822
THESE SENATORS ARE SOME OF THE 

2287
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:16,191
MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE IN THE 

2288
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:17,792
WORLD. 

2289
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:21,896
MANY OF THEM ARE MILLIONAIRES 

2290
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:23,531
MANY TIMES OVER. 

2291
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:25,734
THEY HAVE AN ENORMOUS PLATFORM. 

2292
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:27,135
THE ONLY TIME THEY ARE GOING TO 

2293
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:28,603
HEAR ABOUT HOW PEOPLE FEEL 

2294
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:29,804
ABOUT THE DECISIONS THEY MAKE 

2295
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:31,706
IN THEIR NAME ARE WHEN THEY 

2296
01:23:31,706 --> 01:23:33,441
INTERACT AT THIS LEVEL. 

2297
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:35,010
FOR A SENATOR TO DISMISS HOW 

2298
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:37,011
PEOPLE ARE FEELING, I THINK IT 

2299
01:23:37,011 --> 01:23:39,814
SAYS A LOT ABOUT WHY PEOPLE ON 

2300
01:23:39,814 --> 01:23:43,818
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE ARE 

2301
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:44,485
ANGRY WITH THIS CONGRESS. 

2302
01:23:44,485 --> 01:23:45,220
>> SURE. 

2303
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:48,823
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DO TAKE THE 

2304
01:23:48,823 --> 01:23:51,760
DAY OFF WORK, WHO REALLY HAD 

2305
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,861
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPEN IN 

2306
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:54,362
THEIR LIFE TO TALK TO A SENATOR 

2307
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:56,464
AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH 

2308
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:57,866
THEM, THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. 

2309
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:00,235
AND I TALKED TO BOB CORKER 

2310
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:03,038
ABOUT THIS, ONE OF THOSE 

2311
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:04,339
REPUBLICAN SENATORS APPROACHED 

2312
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:05,874
AT THE APARTMENT ON MONDAY BY A 

2313
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,642
GROUP OF PEOPLE AND MEN DOING 

2314
01:24:07,642 --> 01:24:08,909
IT TO OTHER REPUBLICAN SENATORS 

2315
01:24:08,909 --> 01:24:11,546
AND WERE UP HERE IN THE HALLS 

2316
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:12,947
OF CONGRESS GOING INTO OFFICES 

2317
01:24:12,947 --> 01:24:16,151
AND WHAT NOT AND SCREAMING AT 

2318
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:16,484
THE SENATORS. 

2319
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:17,752
BOB CORKER SAYS THERE IS A 

2320
01:24:17,752 --> 01:24:18,453
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEONE 

2321
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:20,955
WALKING ACROSS THE HALL SAYING 

2322
01:24:20,955 --> 01:24:23,358

WHAT THEY ARE GETTING WITH THE 

2326

PROTESTERS THAT ARE BUM RUSHING 

2327
01:24:30,098 --> 01:24:33,068
THEM AND SCREAMING IN THEIR 

2328
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:34,169
FACE, NOT SAYING ANYTHING OR 

2329
01:24:34,169 --> 01:24:35,203
HAVING A CONVERSATION. 

2330
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:36,938
I HAVE BEEN UP HERE ON CAPITOL

01:24:43,678 --> 01:24:49,416
ISSUES, POLARIZING MATTERS AND

01:25:09,804 --> 01:25:10,672
HEARINGS STARTED, YOU KNOW, 

2348
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:12,040
PERHAPS FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, 

2349
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,342
THAT IS MAYBE WHERE HE WAS 

2350
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:17,378
COMING FROM FOR SAYING -- SORT 

2351
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:20,682
OF DISMISSING IT BUT EVEN BOB 

2352
01:25:20,682 --> 01:25:21,849
CORKER WHO ENGAGED WITH THE 

2353
01:25:21,849 --> 01:25:23,184
PROTESTERS AND ANSWERED THEIR 

2354
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:24,819
QUESTIONS THEN WAS SCREAMED AT 

2355
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:26,387
WHEN HE WALKED OUTSIDE THE 

2356
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:28,289
AIRPORT, ANOTHER MAN WITH A 

2357
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:29,791
CAMERA KIND OF SHOOTING HIM TO 

2358
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:34,229
RECORD THIS, HE SAID THIS IS A 

2359
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:34,962
TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING. 

2360
01:25:34,962 --> 01:25:37,899
JEFF FLAKE, THAT BIG MOMENT 

2361
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:42,270
WITH THE PROTESTERS GETTING ON 

2362
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:43,371
THE ELEVATOR OSTENSIBLY THAT 

2363
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:44,972
TURNED HIM BUT KEEP IN MIND THE 

2364
01:25:44,972 --> 01:25:46,407
NIGHT BEFORE ON THURSDAY NIGHT 

2365
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:49,911
HE HAD A PRIVATE MEETING WITH 

2366
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:51,679
LISA MURKOWSKI, SUSAN COLLINS 

2367
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:54,115
AND JOE MANCHIN AFTER THE DAY 

2368
01:25:54,115 --> 01:25:55,349
LONG THURSDAY HEARING. 

2369
01:25:55,349 --> 01:25:59,187
SO, GOES HE KNEW THAT HIS 

2370
01:25:59,187 --> 01:25:59,887
FELLOW COLLEAGUED QUESTIONS. 

2371
01:25:59,887 --> 01:26:03,057
THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT MARK 

2372
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:04,925
JUDGE. 

2373
01:26:04,925 --> 01:26:07,629
REPUBLICANS WANTED TO HEAR MORE 

2374
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:12,500
INFORMATION FROM MARK JUDGE. 

2375
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,403
SO, YES, THE PROTESTERS ARE 

2376
01:26:15,403 --> 01:26:17,105
DEFINITELY GALVANIZING PEOPLE 

2377
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:20,408
BUT IT MAY BE HAVING THE 

2378
01:26:20,408 --> 01:26:20,808
OPPOSITE EFFECT. 

2379
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:22,576
BOB CORKER SAID THEY MAY BE 

2380
01:26:22,576 --> 01:26:23,311
OVERPLAYING THEIR HANDS. 

2381
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:24,412
HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST 

2382
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:27,115
REPUBLICANS TO CALL FOR A STOP 

2383
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:27,915
TO THE KAVANAUGH NOMINATION 

2384
01:26:27,915 --> 01:26:29,951
UNTIL THERE WAS A HEARING WITH 

2385
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:30,418
DR. FORD. 

2386
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:36,924
THIS ISN'T COMING FROM A 

2387
01:26:36,924 --> 01:26:38,359
PARTISAN ON EITHER SIDE. 

2388
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:40,361
HE IS IN THE MIDDLE. 

2389
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:42,530
HE SAID THE PROTESTERS MAY BE 

2390
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:43,064
OVERPLAYING THEIR HANDS. 

2391
01:26:43,064 --> 01:26:48,769
THEY ARE SCREECHING AND NOT 

2392
01:26:48,769 --> 01:26:49,804
WILLING TO ENGAGE IN 

2393
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:50,137
CONVERSATION. 

2394
01:26:50,137 --> 01:26:52,373
SO, IT'S QUITE A TIME TO BE ON 

2395
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:52,940
CAPITOL HILL. 

2396
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:55,209
>> GREAT WAY TO SUM IT UP. 

2397
01:26:55,209 --> 01:26:56,811
>> I RECALL THE PROTESTERS 

2398
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:58,413
EARLIER IN THE WEEK WHILE THERE 

2399
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:01,316
WAS TESTIMONY GOING ON, ONE OF 

2400
01:27:01,316 --> 01:27:02,817
THE OTHER THINGS THEY WERE 

2401
01:27:02,817 --> 01:27:08,923
YELLING IN THE HALLWAY IS 

2402
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:09,791
NOVEMBER IS COMING. 

2403
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:13,628
WE ARE LIVE IN A TIME WHERE 

2404
01:27:13,628 --> 01:27:14,128
FIRES FLARE-UP FAST AND 

2405
01:27:14,128 --> 01:27:14,395
FURIOUS. 

2406
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:15,863
OFTEN IT IS SORT OF SHOCKING 

2407
01:27:15,863 --> 01:27:17,365
WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT SOMETHING 

2408
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:18,065
HAPPENED A WEEK AGO. 

2409
01:27:18,065 --> 01:27:21,435
IT FEELS LIKE A MONTH HAS GONE 

2410
01:27:21,435 --> 01:27:21,903
BY. 

2411
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:24,739
DO YOU THINK, AS WE WERE 

2412
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:25,940
ANTICIPATION, THAT THIS 

2413
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:27,108
NOMINATION, THE KAVANAUGH 

2414
01:27:27,108 --> 01:27:28,576
NOMINATION WILL HAVE AN IMPACT 

2415
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:29,443
COME THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS OR 

2416
01:27:29,443 --> 01:27:31,546
DO YOU THINK BY THE TIME THEY 

2417
01:27:31,546 --> 01:27:32,547
ARE VOTING IN NOVEMBER, THERE 

2418
01:27:32,547 --> 01:27:35,550
WILL BE NINE OTHER THINGS WE 

2419
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:36,350
WILL BE TALKING ABOUT? 

2420
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:39,921
>> I THINK THAT -- THIS IS WHAT 

2421
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:43,090
LINDSAY GRAHAM HAS BEEN SAYING 

2422
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:44,926
PUBLICLY EVERYWHERE. 

2423
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,461
THIS ISSUE OF HOW BRETT 

2424
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:48,262
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION WAS 

2425
01:27:48,262 --> 01:27:50,264
HANDLED AND THE TACTICS 

2426
01:27:50,264 --> 01:27:53,568
EMPLOYED TO ATTEMPT TO STOP IT, 

2427
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:55,937
THAT HAS GALVANIZED REPUBLICANS 

2428
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:57,972
TO COALESCE UNDER ONE PARTY 

2429
01:27:57,972 --> 01:27:58,339
AGAIN. 

2430
01:27:58,339 --> 01:27:59,407
YOU HAVE THE ANTITRUMPERS AND 

2431
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:01,142
THIS IS WHAT IS MOST STRIKING 

2432
01:28:01,142 --> 01:28:04,345
TO ME AFTER THE HEARING ON 

2433
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:04,946
THURSDAY. 

2434
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,447
TALKING TO REPUBLICAN WOMEN ON 

2435
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:07,114
THE HOUSE SIDE. 

2436
01:28:07,114 --> 01:28:10,017
THE HOUSE DOESN'T HAVE A VOTE 

2437
01:28:10,017 --> 01:28:10,418
IN ALL THIS. 

2438
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:12,119
REPUBLICAN WOMEN ONE OF WHOM 

2439
01:28:12,119 --> 01:28:13,521
WAS IN AN ANTITRUMP OFFICE AND 

2440
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:15,990
IS NOT A BIG FAN OF THE 

2441
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:17,625
PRESIDENT SAYING THAT THAT IS 

2442
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:17,892
IT. 

2443
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:19,060
PEOPLE WILL GO OUT TO VOTE. 

2444
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,896
BRETT KAVANAUGH COULD HAVE BEEN 

2445
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:22,663
MY SON. 

2446
01:28:22,663 --> 01:28:25,666
HE COULD HAVE BEEN MY FATHER, 

2447
01:28:25,666 --> 01:28:25,933
BROTHER. 

2448
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:28,569
AND, YOU KNOW, HE WASN'T 

2449
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:30,638
TREATED FAIRLY AND YOU RUINED 

2450
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:33,508
THIS GUY'S REPUTATION, SAYING 

2451
01:28:33,508 --> 01:28:35,510
THE DEMOCRATS RUINED THIS GUY'S 

2452
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:35,943
REPUTATION. 

2453
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:37,245
IT WAS NOT FAIR. 

2454
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:38,346
THEY SAT ON THE INFORMATION FOR 

2455
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:39,847
45 DAYS WHICH MAY BE ONE REASON 

2456
01:28:39,847 --> 01:28:41,783
WHY HE IS VOTING THE WAY HE IS 

2457
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:46,120
VOTING OR PROMPT HIM TO VOTE 

2458
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:46,487
FOR KAVANAUGH. 

2459
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:48,823
WHY DIDN'T THE COMMITTEE GO TO 

2460
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:49,123
CALIFORNIA. 

2461
01:28:49,123 --> 01:28:52,360
SHE SAID UNDER OATH IN THE 

2462
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:52,994
COMMITTEE THAT IT WASN'T CLEAR 

2463
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:55,129
THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD GO TO 

2464
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:55,329
HER. 

2465
01:28:55,329 --> 01:29:02,570
THE COMMITTEE REACHED OUT TO 

2466
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:03,771
HER ATTORNEYS FOUR TIMES BEFORE 

2467
01:29:03,771 --> 01:29:05,305
A HEARING WAS AGREED TO. 

2468
01:29:05,305 --> 01:29:08,443
WE COULD COME TO YOU. 

2469
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:09,777
REPUBLICANS ARE PAYING 

2470
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:11,546
ATTENTION TO IT. 

2471
01:29:11,546 --> 01:29:13,448
AND THE SCORCHED EARTH TACTICS 

2472
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:15,183
IS GALVANIZING THEM NOT 

2473
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:22,757
NECESSARILY IN FAVOR OF TRUMP 

2474
01:29:22,757 --> 01:29:23,290
BUT DIRTY TRICKS. 

2475
01:29:23,290 --> 01:29:24,258
I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THIS 

2476
01:29:24,258 --> 01:29:25,793
FROM THE REPUBLICANS I WAS 

2477
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:27,895
HEARING IT FROM. 

2478
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:33,034
>> THAT IS AN INTERESTING 

2479
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:33,267
POINT. 

2480
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:33,901
SEVERAL REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS 

2481
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:35,303
HAVE MENTIONED THAT TO US 

2482
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:36,270
INCLUDING FRAN TOWNSEND THAT 

2483
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:40,274
SAID UP UNTIL THIS MOMENT THEY 

2484
01:29:40,274 --> 01:29:41,275
HADN'T SEEN SOMETHING THAT 

2485
01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:42,743
GALVANIZED REPUBLICANS, EVEN 

2486
01:29:42,743 --> 01:29:44,579
THOSE THAT WERE NEVER TRUMPERS 

2487
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:45,412
AROUND A SINGLE ISSUE. 

2488
01:29:45,412 --> 01:29:47,281
THE QUESTION IS THAT I WONDER 

2489
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:51,886
IF THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING 

2490
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:53,788
BECAUSE THE NARRATIVE -- THESE 

2491
01:29:53,788 --> 01:29:55,790
ARE FAST TIVES, 

2492
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:58,993
-- NARRATIVES THAT EXIST IN THE 

2493
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:00,661
MEDIA WORLD MAYBE NOT THE REAL 

2494
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:00,894
WORLD. 

2495
01:30:00,894 --> 01:30:06,033
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE 

2496
01:30:06,033 --> 01:30:06,734
PRESIDENT, RIGHT? 

2497
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:07,134
>> EXACTLY RIGHT. 

2498
01:30:07,134 --> 01:30:09,003
WHEN IT COMES TO DEMOCRATS HAS 

2499
01:30:09,003 --> 01:30:10,404
BEEN THEY ARE GALVANIZED AND 

2500
01:30:10,404 --> 01:30:11,438
THEY ARE ANGRY. 

2501
01:30:11,438 --> 01:30:13,708
YOU SAW A MILLION WOMEN 

2502
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:14,809
MARCHING AFTER THE INAUGURATION 

2503
01:30:14,809 --> 01:30:16,310
AND THEY ARE THE PEOPLE THAT 

2504
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:19,514
WILL COME OUT AND VOTE. 

2505
01:30:19,514 --> 01:30:22,383
THEY ARE TAKING THE LESSONS OF 

2506
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:23,017
2014 THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS 

2507
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:25,520
BEEN HAMMERING AT THE SPEECHES 

2508
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:26,821
HE WAS GIVING THAT ELECTIONS 

2509
01:30:26,821 --> 01:30:27,254
HAVE CONSEQUENCES. 

2510
01:30:27,254 --> 01:30:27,822
PEOPLE GET IT. 

2511
01:30:27,822 --> 01:30:30,224
>> WHAT WE MAY SEE IS AFTER 

2512
01:30:30,224 --> 01:30:34,161
JUSTICE THOMAS WHICH WAS A WAVE 

2513
01:30:34,161 --> 01:30:36,464
OF WOMEN COMING IN. 

2514
01:30:36,464 --> 01:30:36,764
>> EXACTLY. 

2515
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:38,666
IS THIS A WAY FOR REPUBLICAN 

2516
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:41,268
POLLSTERS AND SPIN DOCTORS TO 

2517
01:30:41,268 --> 01:30:42,837
SAY, NO, WE ARE GALVANIZED THE 

2518
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:46,040
SAME WAY THE GUYS ON THE BLUE 

2519
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:46,307
TEAM ARE. 

2520
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:47,108
>> HONESTLY, THESE PEOPLE HAD 

2521
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:50,744
NO REASON TO SAY THAT THEY WERE 

2522
01:30:50,744 --> 01:30:51,412
FIRED UP LIKE THEY WERE. 

2523
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:53,781
I HADN'T SEEN REPUBLICANS FIRED 

2524
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:55,216
UP LIKE THIS. 

2525
01:30:55,216 --> 01:30:56,017
THE DEMOCRATS WERE ALREADY 

2526
01:30:56,017 --> 01:30:57,785
GALVANIZED. 

2527
01:30:57,785 --> 01:30:59,320
THEY WANT TO GET OUT THE VOTE. 

2528
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:00,421
THEY ARE RARING TO GO. 

2529
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:02,423
THIS ISN'T LIKE A RALLY TO GET 

2530
01:31:02,423 --> 01:31:03,124
TO THE POLLS. 

2531
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:06,661
THE REPUBLICANS ARE SITTING 

2532
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:08,129
BACK SAYING THINGS ARE GOING 

2533
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:08,563
WELL. 

2534
01:31:08,563 --> 01:31:10,965
THAT IS WHO -- NOT ALL OF THEM 

2535
01:31:10,965 --> 01:31:11,465
LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

2536
01:31:11,465 --> 01:31:13,367
EVEN MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE ARE 

2537
01:31:13,367 --> 01:31:14,168
NOT BIG FANS. 

2538
01:31:14,168 --> 01:31:15,837
THEY HAVE A TOUGH TIME 

2539
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:20,141
ANSWERING THE TWEETS THAT THE 

2540
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:21,742
PRESIDENT SENDS OUT. 

2541
01:31:21,742 --> 01:31:23,311
BUT, AGAIN, IT WASN'T 

2542
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:23,844
NECESSARILY WHAT BRETT 

2543
01:31:23,844 --> 01:31:27,715
KAVANAUGH IS OR THAT HE IS SUCH 

2544
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:28,115
A GREAT JUSTICE. 

2545
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:28,716
EVEN LISTENING ON THE SENATE 

2546
01:31:28,716 --> 01:31:30,451
FLOOR WE ARE NOT HEARING ABOUT 

2547
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:32,987
THE CASES THAT HE HAS RULED IN 

2548
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:33,920
FAVOR OF OR AGAINST OR THE 

2549
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,223
POSITIONS HE HAS TAKEN OR HOW 

2550
01:31:36,223 --> 01:31:37,658
MANY TIMES HE HAS BEEN 

2551
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:41,295
OVERRULED BY THE SUPREME COURT. 

2552
01:31:41,295 --> 01:31:44,799
WE ARE LISTENING TO HOW HE WAS 

2553
01:31:44,799 --> 01:31:45,699
TREATED WHEN SOMEBODY ACCUSED 

2554
01:31:45,699 --> 01:31:47,101
THIS MAN OF COMMITTING CRIMES, 

2555
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:48,869
COMMITTING A FELONY AND NOT 

2556
01:31:48,869 --> 01:31:49,870
ABLE TO PROVE IT PER SAY OR 

2557
01:31:49,870 --> 01:31:55,543
PROVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE 

2558
01:31:55,543 --> 01:31:56,276
GOING TO BE VOTING. 

2559
01:31:56,276 --> 01:31:57,545
THAT DOES GALVANIZE FOLKS THAT 

2560
01:31:57,545 --> 01:32:00,548
DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO BE 

2561
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:03,851
A PART OF THEIR LIVES, MORE FOR 

2562
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:05,853
LIMITED GOVERNMENT AND INNOCENT 

2563
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:06,654
 

2564
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:08,155
I REALIZED WHAT A BIG DEAL IT 

2565
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:10,558
WAS -- THE THING FASCINATING TO 

2566
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:11,992
ME, I TALKED TO THREE 

2567
01:32:11,992 --> 01:32:13,494
REPUBLICAN WOMEN WHO I THOUGHT 

2568
01:32:13,494 --> 01:32:14,996
OH, WHAT ARE THY GOING TO SAY 

2569
01:32:14,996 --> 01:32:21,502
AND IN FACT IT WAS THE OPPOSITE 

2570
01:32:21,502 --> 01:32:25,873
OF WHAT I ANTICIPATED TO HEAR. 

2571
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:28,576
LISA MURKOWSKI, YOU KNOW, SHE 

2572
01:32:28,576 --> 01:32:29,109
HAS REASONS AGAINST JUDGE 

2573
01:32:29,109 --> 01:32:29,743
KAVANAUGH BASED ON THE RULINGS 

2574
01:32:29,743 --> 01:32:32,880
THAT HE HAS MADE AND THE E-

2575
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:36,751
MAILS HE SENT IN HIS ROLE AS 

2576
01:32:36,751 --> 01:32:38,185
GEORGE W. BUSH'S PERSONAL 

2577
01:32:38,185 --> 01:32:41,055
SECRETARY BACK IN THE BUSH 

2578
01:32:41,055 --> 01:32:41,288
YEARS. 

2579
01:32:41,288 --> 01:32:42,556
BUT REGARDING THE SEXUAL 

2580
01:32:42,556 --> 01:32:45,159
ASSAULT, THAT PUTS IT IN A 

2581
01:32:45,159 --> 01:32:45,626
DIFFERENT BOX. 

2582
01:32:45,626 --> 01:32:48,229
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT INNOCENT 

2583
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:50,531
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. 

2584
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:51,465
SHE WAS A COUNTY PROSECUTOR. 

2585
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:54,602
IT'S THOSE FOLKS THAT GET FIRED 

2586
01:32:54,602 --> 01:32:54,768
UP. 

2587
01:32:54,768 --> 01:32:57,772
THERE IS A REASON LINDSAY 

2588
01:32:57,772 --> 01:32:58,873
GRAHAM IS FIRED UP ABOUT THIS. 

2589
01:32:58,873 --> 01:33:01,842
YOU GOT TO HAVE EVIDENCE. 

2590
01:33:01,842 --> 01:33:04,044
YOU GOT TO HAVE IT. 

2591
01:33:04,044 --> 01:33:05,946
WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR NOT, IT'S 

2592
01:33:05,946 --> 01:33:07,548
LIKE HOW DOES JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 

2593
01:33:07,548 --> 01:33:08,749
IF HE IS NOT CONFIRMED, HOW 

2594
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:12,086
DOES HE GO BACK TO THE BENCH. 

2595
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:13,954
IF THE SENATE THINKS HE 

2596
01:33:13,954 --> 01:33:14,588
COMMITTED THIS SEXUAL ASSAULT, 

2597
01:33:14,588 --> 01:33:17,825
HOW DOES HE GO BACK TO THE 

2598
01:33:17,825 --> 01:33:18,058
BENCH. 

2599
01:33:18,058 --> 01:33:19,226
WILL THEY TAKE ACTIONS -- IF 

2600
01:33:19,226 --> 01:33:21,796
DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL OF THE 

2601
01:33:21,796 --> 01:33:27,969
SENATE, WILL THEY TRY TO 

2602
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:31,738
IMPEACH HIM AS A FEDERAL JUDGE? 

2603
01:33:31,738 --> 01:33:32,773
IT JUST SHAKES UP EVERYTHING. 

2604
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:35,076
DONALD TRUMP, AS CAITLYN WAS 

2605
01:33:35,076 --> 01:33:36,377
SAYING, APPOINTING JUDGES, THIS 

2606
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:37,678
IS THE REASON SO MANY 

2607
01:33:37,678 --> 01:33:39,880
REPUBLICANS WENT TO THE POLLS 

2608
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:43,184
AND VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP, 

2609
01:33:43,184 --> 01:33:44,952
EVANGELICALS VOTED FOR DONALD 

2610
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:45,386
TRUMP. 

2611
01:33:45,386 --> 01:33:47,355
AD UNLESS YOU HAVE A 

2612
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:48,723
GALVANIZING ISSUE LIKE THIS, 

2613
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:53,794
GOES IT'S HARD TO GET THOSE 

2614
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:56,030
FOLKS OUT IN THE MIDTERMS. 

2615
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:57,798
ASK BUSH IN 2006. 

2616
01:33:57,798 --> 01:34:03,204
IT DIDN'T GO WELL FOR HIM. 

2617
01:34:03,204 --> 01:34:03,571
IT'S UNCLEAR. 

2618
01:34:03,571 --> 01:34:06,006
UNLESS I HEARD MY SOURCES TELL 

2619
01:34:06,006 --> 01:34:08,075
ME WITH THEIR OWN -- UNLESS 

2620
01:34:08,075 --> 01:34:11,412
THEY TOLD ME THIS PERSONALLY I 

2621
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:14,080
WOULD PROBABLY THINK OH, THE 

2622
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,250
REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, WISHFUL 

2623
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:17,284
THINKING BUT I DON'T KNOW. 

2624
01:34:17,284 --> 01:34:18,586
>> WE ARE A MONTH OUT. 

2625
01:34:18,586 --> 01:34:21,288
WE HAVE TO SEE HOW IT PLAYS 

2626
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:21,488

BIT.

>>> ALL RIGHT. 

2635
01:34:29,963 --> 01:34:31,298
WE ARE GOING TO COVER THIS BUT 

2636
01:34:31,298 --> 01:34:33,934
