A ST.
LOUIS PIZZA OWNER WAS
TEARGASSED DURING PROTESTS, BY
THE
POLICE, AND HE WANTS THE POLICE
CHIEF TO BE FIRED.
THIS IS PART
OF A GROWING MOVEMENT TO
DISPLACE AND GET RID OF THE
TEMPORARY POLICE CHIEF IN ST.
LOUIS.
WHAT'S THE STORY OF THE
PIZZERIA OWNER?
WELL, HIS NAME
IS CHRIS SUMMERS AND HE'S THE
OWNER OF PIE PIZZERIA, AND HE
SAID THAT HIS PLACE A FEW NIGHTS
AGO WAS TEARGASSED BY POLICE
OFFICERS WHO DIDN'T REALLY NEED
TO TEARGAS ANYONE BY HIS
ACCOUNTS, IT WAS ESCALATING A
SITUATION THAT WASN'T GOING TO
ESCALATE OTHERWISE.
THE POLICE
WERE ACTING INAPPROPRIATELY.
FOLLOWING THAT, THE POLICE UNION
AND THE BLUE LIVES MATTER
MOVEMENTS POSTED ON FACEBOOK A
CALL TO ACTION FOR A BUNCH OF
FOLKS OUT THERE TO ACTUALLY GO
AND CALL THE PIZZERIA UP AND
ESSENTIALLY HARASS THEM AND TIE
UP THEIR PHONE LINES IN THE
MEANTIME.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
THE ACTUAL QUOTE:
ANOTHER BUSINESS OWNER IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD, WHO OWNS A
BOOKSTORE SAYS:
SO THERE YOU GO.
AND THEIR THEY ARE SAYING
WHITE, I DON'T KNOW THE RACE OF
THE PERSON WHO SAID THAT,
MEANING THAT IT IS NOT
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMUNITY.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
BEING EXTREMELY WHITE.
THEY ARE
JUST SAYING THIS IS NOT POLICE
FORCE THAT'S FROM THIS COMMUNITY
AND REPRESENTS THIS COMMUNITY,
AND YOU CAN TELL WHEN THE COPS
CLEARED OUT THE PROTESTERS ON
SUNDAY NIGHT, WHEN THEY STARTED
CHANTING, WHOSE STREETS?
OUR
STREETS.
WELL, NO.
YOU'RE
WORKING FOR THE CITIZENS.
THAT'S THEIR STREETS, AND THEY
PAY YOUR SALARY.
BUT THEY
CLEARLY IN THAT CHANT SHOW YOU
THAT THAT IS NOT THEIR ATTITUDE.
IT'S NOT THEIR FRAME OF MIND.
THEIR FRAME OF MIND IS, US
VERSUS THEM.
THE CITIZENS ARE
THE BAD GUYS AND NOW WE TOOK THE
STREETS AWAY FROM THEM.
REMEMBER, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
POLICING THE COMMUNITY ON
BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY.
I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT THE
RESTAURANT OWNERS ARE SPEAKING
OUT.
SOME OF THEM ARE DOING SO
WITHOUT DISCLOSING THEIR
IDENTITY BECAUSE THEY ARE
WORRIED EVER TELL YOU SHE AND,
BUT THE FACT THAT THESE
RESTAURANT OWNERS ARE NOW COMING
OUT AND SAYING NO, THIS INTERIM
POLICE CHIEF IS A PROBLEM.
WE
SAW POLICE OFFICERS ACTING IN A
WAY THAT ESCALATED THE
SITUATION.
THEY WERE USING DON
LETHAL WEAPONS EXCESSIVELY, EVEN
WHEN THEIR WORDS PROTESTERS IN
THE VICINITY AT THAT TIME, SO
LOOK, WE ALWAYS GET THE TWO
SIDES AND IT'S THE SIDE OF THE
PROTESTERS, THE SIDE OF THE
COPS.
THE COPS USUALLY HAVE A
WAY OF DOMINATING THE HEADLINES
AND MAKING IT APPEAR TO BE A
NUMBER OF VIOLENCE VANDALS WHO
ARE THROWING BRICKS THROUGH
WINDOWS AND THIS AND THAT, AND
IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR FROM
THOSE ACTUAL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO
WERE SAYING, NO.
THE PROBLEM
HERE IS THE WAY THAT THE
POLICING IS GOING DOWN.
WE NEED BETTER LEADERSHIP THERE.
YEAH, AND PART OF THE REASON
THIS IS MAKING NEWS IS BECAUSE
UNFORTUNATELY, BUSINESS LEADERS
HAVE MORE OF A VOICE THAT THE
MEDIA RESPECTS THAN THE AVERAGE
CITIZEN.
SO WHEN BUSINESS
LEADERS ARE LIKE HEY, THIS IS
NOT HELPING THIS AREA, PEOPLE
ARE LIKE WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.
THIS AFFECTS MY MONEY.
WE
SHOULD TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.
AND
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE,
BUT THE PERSON ON THE GROUND
THAT I'M SUPER PROUD OF THAT HAS
LED A LOT OF THESE PROTESTS IS
COREY BUSH.
COREY BUSH IS
ACTUALLY A JUSTICE DEMOCRAT.
SHE'S RUNNING FOR OFFICE, AND
IT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT.
PART OF
THE REASON TO JUSTICE DEMOCRATS
PICKED HER IS BECAUSE SHE HAS
BEEN LEADING PROTESTS, AND A
LEADER IN THE COMMUNITY ALL
THROUGHOUT.
I'M GOING TO GO TO
GRAPHIC 15.
WHEN 
THEY STARTED
DOING THE PROTESTS IN THE FIRST
PLACE, COREY BUSH SAID:
NOW OF COURSE, THE REASON THAT
PEOPLE WERE SO OUTRAGED IS
BECAUSE THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN IN
THAT CASE WAS SHOT AND HE HAD NO
DNA ON THE GUN AND THE COP DID
HAVE DNA ON THE GUN.
HE PAUSED,
FIRED THE LAST KILL SHOT.
I
MEAN, AND HE SAID, I'M GOING TO
GO KILL THE GUY BEFORE HAND AND
HE STILL WAS ACQUITTED.
IT WAS
A PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS CASE
AND COREY BUSH THEN LED A SILENT
PROTEST SO JUST TO MAKE A POINT,
WHICH IS SUCH A GREAT IDEA.
THEY KEEP SAYING WE'RE CHANCING
THE WRONG THINGS.
THEY KEEP
SAYING THAT WERE VIOLENCE, ETC.
YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO
DO?
FINE.
WE WILL HAVE A
COMPLETELY SILENT PROTEST.
PEOPLE, LINES OF 12 PEOPLE
LOCKED ARMS PROTESTING
THROUGHOUT THE STREETS AND SHE
SAID AT THE END OF THAT PROTEST,
THE PURPOSE OF THIS ACTION WAS
TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT OUR
PRESENCE IS POWERFUL.
THIS WAS
POWER WALKING DOWN THE STREET.
AND SHE SAID, WE ARE NOT AFRAID
OF BEING ARRESTED.
WE'RE NOT
AFRAID OF BEING TALKED ABOUT.
WE'RE NOT AFRAID TO DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO SAY TO THEM, YOU
WILL STOP KILLING US.
THAT'S
POWERFUL.
SO THANKS TO COREY
BUSH FOR DOING THAT.
SHE WAS
ACTUALLY THE VERY FIRST
CANDIDATE FOR JUSTICE DEMOCRATS.
REALLY?
YEAH.
AND SHE'S RUNNING AN
ELECTION AND IF YOU'VE GOT REAL
POWERFUL COMMUNITY LEADERS,
WHO'RE ON YOUR SIDE, YOU SHOULD
BE ON THEIR SIDE.
GO BACK HER
BECAUSE SHE WAS THERE FROM DAY
ONE.
SO GOD BLESS THE BUSINESS
LEADERS IN THE COMMUNITY LEADERS
WHO ARE FIGHTING BACK TO MAKE
SURE THAT YOUR VOICE IS
REPRESENTED.
