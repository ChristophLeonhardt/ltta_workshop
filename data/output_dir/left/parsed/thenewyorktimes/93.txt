“I’m Jon Turteltaub.
I’m the director of "The Meg."
When the scene begins, this
is Jason Statham swimming out
to the Megalodon
because they’re
afraid a boat will distract it. 
It'll attack the boat.
So they realize the safest way
is to just swim on your own.
“Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming."
Narrator: And as Jason says,
just keep swimming,
that’s a line that I
borrowed from "Finding Nemo."
Jason was not exactly
pleased, but he finally
realized how great it was.
And the thought of
him saying that,
you just don’t think of him
as a "Finding Nemo" fan.
Here, you know,
we have a scene
that I kind of built
around GoPro footage
I’ve seen of people in
the middle of the ocean,
usually on a surfboard.
And they tend to take their
GoPro, stick it in the water,
look around, and stick
it back in the water.
And suddenly, there’ll
be a shark there.
And there’s nothing
scarier than knowing
you’re supposed to see
something and not seeing it.
It’s always what
you don’t see.
So here, we just kept
the suspense going.
And sticking your head up,
then sticking your head down.
And you realize
you’re this close,
and you can’t see a thing.
So the longer you wait,
the better it got.
But eventually, bang, you
gotta see that shark.
Jason, being such a
confident swimmer,
was able to stay out in
this water a lot longer
than a lot of
actors could have.
Treading water is not easy.
Now, when you see
this next shot,
coming in at the darting — 
bang — that’s 100% CG.
Everything you
see in that shot.
Here, we start
pulling him back in.
And as the rope goes out,
you see the flinging water.
That’s called a rooster tail.
I didn’t know what that was.
But what that really is
is something that you —
it helps you see the rope when
that happens in real life.
And then we had to add
it in CG the next time
so that people could see it.
Again, here, the shark, we’re
seeing very little of it.
It’s always being teased.
It’s always just enough —
a fin, a wake in the water.
Here’s the rooster tail.
When he speeds the boat
up, zing, here it comes.
And now you get to see
a little bit more shark.
And that’s one of
the first times
you really see the shark
clearly in the movie.
That is Jason being
pulled through that water.
Again, not easy.
I don’t think it’s fun
after the 40th time.
Everyone else is
safe on the boat.
But these shots are a
mixture of CG right there.
You’ve got a guy in
a tank right there.
You’ve got a CG ocean.
Now you’ve got a
real ocean there.
Now you’ve got a set.
Now you’ve got a fake boat.
Now you’ve got a piece of
set and fake water going
by in the background.
Ugh, it’s a lot."
