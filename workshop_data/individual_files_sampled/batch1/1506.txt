it will be the first parliamentary election in nearly a decade polls were repeatedly postponed until a new electoral law was agreed proportional representation has replaced Lebanon's winner-takes-all system but some are criticizing the new law for benefiting the ruling political class who have been forging unlikely electoral alliances just to stay in power the main objective is to increase the number of seat or save the number of seats in the parliament the new law is supposed to give a chance to first-time hopefuls but breaking the establishments decades-long hold on power is not easy the problem is that the civil society representatives are not one group now they say that they are in one list just to say that we are one but in reality they are divided Hezbollah and Amal are the only parties that formed joint electoral lists at a national level they have long dominated the Shia Muslim political landscape but they are facing opposition from within limited but a challenge nevertheless and that is why Hezbollah has been campaigning extra hard if you have a Shia be used against them voted in by Shia votes that's a new thing so I you know I don't know it will extend this would change the political scene one thing will change Prime Minister saddle Harry they will lose seats because of the way electoral districts are carved out but he is expected to be the Sunni leader with the biggest Block in parliament he does however face opposition from within his community with some blaming him for not taking a hard-line stance against the Iranian backed Hezbollah aquiline Tecate the elections will be a chance for hadera to prove that he is the strongest sir new leader and can be the next prime minister christian candidates are also battling for leadership of their community the poll will determine their popularity a few years before they vie for the presidency a post reserved for a Maronite Christian a lot has changed since the last election the long-established political divisions of the past are now gone the battle is no longer between the pro Iran March 8th Alliance and the pro Saudi March 14 coalition march 14 has largely fragmented and the issue that divided them Hezbollah's military power which is stronger than the Lebanese army has been shelved at least for the time being Lebanon's rival politicians have been focusing instead on securing their power if the hope was to bring about a new generation of leaders that likely will not happen there may be some changes within Parliament but there is a general consensus that these elections will not assure in major changes to the political landscape XANA further al Jazeera Beirut
