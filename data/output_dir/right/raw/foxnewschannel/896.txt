00:00:50,526 --> 00:00:53,996
TO THE FBI AND TAKE A POLL OF

27
00:00:53,996 --> 00:00:56,165

00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,801
>> IT WAS AS FREEWHEELING AND

30
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:01,403
BOMBASTIC AS IT WAS REMARKABLE.

00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:20,155
>> President Trump: I THINK

45
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:22,491
THE REPORT YESTERDAY MAY BE MORE

46
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:24,226
IMPORTANTLY THAN ANYTHING, IT

47
00:01:24,226 --> 00:01:25,861
TOTALLY EXONERATES ME.

48
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:28,230
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION, THERE

49
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,465
WAS NO OBSTRUCTION, AND IF YOU

51
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,569
THAT.

52
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:36,205
EXONERATE THE PRESIDENT DID

53
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:36,939
CRITICIZE FORMER FBI DIRECTOR

54
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,807
JIM COMEY SAYING HE HAD BEEN

55
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:39,775
INSUBORDINATE DURING THE PROBE

56
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:42,611
AND DEVIATED FROM

57
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:43,278
WELL-ESTABLISHED DEPARTMENT

58
00:01:43,278 --> 00:01:43,645
POLICIES.

59
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,881
>> I THINK THAT JAMES COMEY WAS

60
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:47,716
UNFAIR TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS

61
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:48,050
COUNTRY.

62
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,819
I THINK HE GOES DOWN AS THE

63
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,221
WORST FBI DIRECTOR IN HISTORY.

64
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:54,056
>> HE ALSO VENTED ABOUT THE

65
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:54,823
ONE-TIME LEAD INVESTIGATOR OF

INQUIRIES, PETER STRZOK.

68
00:01:58,694 --> 00:02:02,231
A DISCREDITED FBI AGENT WHOSE

69
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:03,799
BEHAVIOR WAS CONCLUDED AS BIASED

70
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,669
AND ANTITHETICAL TO THE CORE

71
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,804
VALUES OF THE FBI AND DOA.

72
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:09,437
>> President Trump: PETER

73
00:02:09,437 --> 00:02:10,806
STRZOK SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED A

74
00:02:10,806 --> 00:02:11,473
LONG TIME AGO.

75
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:14,209
>> LATER ALMOST IN PASSING THE

76
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:15,777
PRESIDENT MADE WHAT AMOUNTED TO

77
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:18,413
A PASSING ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT THE

78
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:20,315
LARGEST TRADING PARTNER, CHINA.

79
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:22,784
>> WE ARE PUTTING TARIFFS ON

80
00:02:22,784 --> 00:02:24,686
TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER THINGS.

81
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,655
WE HAVE TO COME UP WE'VE TREATED

82
00:02:26,655 --> 00:02:28,891
UNFAIRLY.

83
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:36,198
>> THE RETALIATION SAID THE

84
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:39,034
PRESIDENT FOR UNFAIR TRADE

85
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:39,401
PRACTICES.

86
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:40,402
AND DEMOCRATIC CHUCK SCHUMER

87
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:45,607
CALLED ACTIONS ON THE MONEY AND

88
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:51,013
CALLING THEM THE RAIL TRADE

89
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:51,780
ENEMY.

90
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,216
>> WE WILL IMMEDIATELY RESPOND

91
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,451
AND TAKE NECESSARY MEASURES TO

92
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:57,986
DEFEND OUR LEGITIMATE RANKS AND

93
00:02:57,986 --> 00:02:58,353
INTERESTS.

94
00:02:58,353 --> 00:03:00,422
>> ALSO GETTING THE PRESIDENT'S

95
00:03:00,422 --> 00:03:01,590
ATTENTION TODAY, ALTHOUGH

96
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,625
PERHAPS UNWANTED ATTENTION WAS

97
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,027
HIS EPA ADMINISTRATOR, SCOTT

98
00:03:05,027 --> 00:03:06,995
PRUITT.

99
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:07,629
THE SUBJECT OF NUMEROUS

100
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,831
INVESTIGATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:12,134
INCLUDING A REPORT IN TODAY'S

00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:14,436
"WASHINGTON POST" THAT AN ENERGY

103
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:16,305
P.R. EXECUTIVE HELPED HIM SCORE

104
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:17,205
ROSE BOWL TICKETS.

105
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:18,140
>> AND LOOKING AT SCOTT AND HE

106
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,377
HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB AT EPA.

107
00:03:22,377 --> 00:03:26,181
BUT, I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT CERTAIN

108
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:26,949
THINGS.

109
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:29,584
>> THE EMBATTLED EPA CHIEF IS

110
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,553
UNDER FIRE FOR ALLEGEDLY WASTING

111
00:03:31,553 --> 00:03:32,988

TO RUN PERSONAL ERRANDS.
