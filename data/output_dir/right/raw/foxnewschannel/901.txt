00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:49,519
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

25
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:51,054

THEY'LL RETALIATE.

38
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:07,370
THEY HAVE SAID THIS PRESIDENT IS

39
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,505
DAMAGING AND UNDERMINING THE

40
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:10,273
WORLD GLOBAL TRADE SITUATION AS

41
00:01:10,273 --> 00:01:10,573
IT IS.

42
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:14,711
THIS GUY IS A DISRUPTOR.

43
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:16,346
HE TOLD US IN THE CAMPAIGN THIS

44
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:17,080
IS WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO.

45
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,515
>> HE TOLD US HE WAS GOING DO

46
00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:19,983
THIS.

47
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:21,050
THE CHINA HAS A PLAN TO TAKE

48
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,353
OVER THE UNITED STATES IN

49
00:01:23,353 --> 00:01:24,253
MILITARY CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY.

50
00:01:24,253 --> 00:01:26,956
WE ALL AGREE THIS IS A BIG

51
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:27,557
PROBLEM.

52
00:01:27,557 --> 00:01:28,324
THE UNITED STATES OTHERS THAT DO

53
00:01:28,324 --> 00:01:29,625
SOMETHING.

54
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:30,727
TRUMP'S FORMULATION TO GET

55
00:01:30,727 --> 00:01:32,295
LEVERAGE OVER THE CHINESE IS TO

56
00:01:32,295 --> 00:01:33,463
DO MORE TARIFFS.

57
00:01:33,463 --> 00:01:34,364
WE CAN TRY SOMETHING ELSE BUT

58
00:01:34,364 --> 00:01:35,565
THIS IS THE WAY THAT THE

59
00:01:35,565 --> 00:01:37,100
PRESIDENT IS GOING AFTER IT, AND

60
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,835
SO HE HOPES TO GET SOME LEVEL

61
00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:40,837
OVER THEM SO WE MIGHT HAVE REAL

62
00:01:40,837 --> 00:01:41,371
NEGOTIATIONS LATER.

63
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:42,538
>> Shannon: OK, THERE ARE REAL

64
00:01:42,538 --> 00:01:44,407
PEOPLE AT THE END OF THIS NOW

65
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:45,375
CHINA SAYS WE'RE GOING TO GO

66
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:46,943
AFTER THE PEOPLE THAT LOVE YOU,

67
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:49,212
THE HEARTLAND, THE FARMERS, THE

68
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:49,746
MIDWEST.

69
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:50,947
IT'S GOING TO HURT SOMEONE IN

70
00:01:50,947 --> 00:01:51,381
THE LONG RUN.

71
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:54,917
WE HAVE MONMOUTH POLL.

72
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:56,019
THEY ASKED ABOUT HOW DO YOU

73
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:57,754
THINK THE TARIFFS WOULD IMPACT

74
00:01:57,754 --> 00:01:59,355
THE U.S. ECONOMY.

75
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:06,963
25% SAID THINK IT'LL HELP.

76
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:08,131
40% SAID THEY THINK IT'LL HURT

77
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:08,564
US.

78
00:02:08,564 --> 00:02:10,699
>> I THINK PUTTING TARIFFS ON

79
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,469
SOYBEANS AND FARMERS IN THE

80
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:14,637
MIDWEST MAY CAUSE US JOBS IN THE

81
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:16,773
LONG RUN.

82
00:02:16,773 --> 00:02:17,774
PRESIDENT BUSH TRIED TARIFFS

83
00:02:17,774 --> 00:02:19,142
EARLY ON.

84
00:02:19,142 --> 00:02:21,110
THE REPORTS CAME OUT LATER THAT

85
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,979
YOU ENDED UP COSTING MORE JOBS

86
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,013
THAN YOU SAVED IN THIS INSTANCE.

87
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:25,181
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

88
00:02:25,181 --> 00:02:25,915
THE PRESIDENT OTHERS THAT PLAY

89
00:02:25,915 --> 00:02:26,382
IT RIGHT.

90
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:28,885
HE DOES HAVE THE CUSHION OF AN

91
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:29,619
AMAZINGLY STRONG ECONOMY WHICH

92
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:30,953
PROBABLY GIVES HIM A LITTLE BIT

93
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:31,954
MORE CONFIDENCE TO TRY THIS,

94
00:02:31,954 --> 00:02:34,090
BUT, YEAH, HE'S GOT TO WATCH IT

95
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,390
HERE.

96
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,059
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT

97
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:36,692
THIS POSSIBLE MEETING NOW

98
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:37,794
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND

99
00:02:37,794 --> 00:02:38,728
VLADIMIR PUTIN.

100
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:40,630
HERE IS WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE

101
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,397
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WILL MEET

102
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:44,667
THIS SUMMER.

103
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,035
>> ARE YOU PLANNING TO MEET WITH

104
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:47,170
PUTIN THIS SUMMER?

105
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:47,837
>> IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE'LL

106
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:48,404
MEET, YEAH.

107
00:02:48,404 --> 00:02:50,073
I THOUGHT YOU KNOW, THIS ALL

108
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:51,908
STARTED BECAUSE SOMEONE, ONE OF

109
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:53,743
YOU, ASKED SOME PUTIN BE IN THE

110
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:54,243
G7?

111
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:56,779
I SAID, NO, SHOULD BE IN THE G8.

112
00:02:56,779 --> 00:02:58,915
A FEW YEARS AGO, PUTIN WAS

113
00:02:58,915 --> 00:02:59,649
CALLED IN WHAT WAS CALLED THE

114
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:00,116
G8.

115
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:01,451
I THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE

116
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:02,752
RUSSIA IN THAN TO HAVE RUSSIA

117
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:03,152
OUT.

118
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:07,123
JUST LIKE NORTH KOREA, JUST LIKE

119
00:03:07,123 --> 00:03:08,124
SOMEBODY ELSE, IT'S MUCH BETTER

120
00:03:08,124 --> 00:03:09,692
IF WE GET ALONG WITH THEM THAN

121
00:03:09,692 --> 00:03:10,059
IF WEDON.

122
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:13,096
>> Shannon: MY IN -- THAN IF

123
00:03:13,096 --> 00:03:13,463
WE DON'T.

124
00:03:13,463 --> 00:03:15,598
>> Shannon: MY UNDERSTANDING

125
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:17,533
IS RUSSIA IS INTERTWINED WITH US

126
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:18,167
ON EVERYTHING ELSE.

127
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,802
IF THEY'RE NOT AT THE TABLE,

128
00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:22,004
WHAT GOOD ARE THE DISCUSSIONS?

129
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:23,239
THAT SEEMED TO ME TO MY

130
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:23,973
INTERPRETATION OF WHAT HE WAS

131
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:24,607
SAYING THERE?

132
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:25,141
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

133
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:25,875
>> I THINK SO.

134
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,210
HE KNOWS ABOUT SYRIA AND

135
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:27,543
UKRAINE.

136
00:03:27,543 --> 00:03:28,744
HE'S MAKING THE CALCULATIONS,

137
00:03:28,744 --> 00:03:30,279
LIKE YOU SAID, BETTER TO HAVE

138
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:30,780
HIM AT THE TABLE.

139
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,148
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE ALL THERE

140
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:33,816
YET BECAUSE OF THE RUSSIAN

141
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:35,084
BEHAVIOR ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE

142
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,486
MIDDLE EAST.

143
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:37,320
THEY ARE TRYING TO THWART THE

144
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,621
UNITED STATES EVERYWHERE WE GO,

145
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:39,422
BUT I GET IT.

146
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:40,256
HE'S THE PRESIDENT.

147
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:42,458
HE'S GOT TO MAINTAIN THE BIG

148
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:42,959
PICTURE IN MIND.

149
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,361
HE'S TRYING TO SALVAGE SOME SORT

150
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:48,131
OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA,

151
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:49,799
EVEN AS THE CONGRESS AND OTHERS

152
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,400
ARE AGGRESSIVELY GOING AFTER

153
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,667
HIM.

154
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:54,170
>> Shannon: WHEN YOU LOOK BACK

155
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,538
ON THINGS INCLUDE CRIMEA AND

156
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:56,572
UKRAINE, THERE ARE SERIOUS

157
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:56,906
ISSUES.

158
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:59,108
AS YOU SAID, IT'S BASICALLY A

159
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,009
PROXY WAR WHEN IT COMES TO SYRIA

160
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,310
AND A LOT OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN

161
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,745
THE MIDDLE EAST.

162
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:05,181
THE PRESIDENT SAID, YEAH, I MAY

163
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:07,116
SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH THIS GUY

164
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:09,285
BUT THE U.S. HAS BEEN TOUGH.

165
00:04:09,285 --> 00:04:10,286
THE SANCTION THAT HAS ARE

166
00:04:10,286 --> 00:04:11,654
LEVIED.

167
00:04:11,654 --> 00:04:13,156
-- SANKS THAT ARE LEVIED.

168
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:14,590
OTHER THINGS THAT GO ON THAT

169
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,226
AREN'T IN THE MEDIA EVERY DAY

170
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:20,963
BUT IT'S A SCHIZOPHRENIC

171
00:04:20,963 --> 00:04:21,697
RELATIONSHIP?

172
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:26,135
>> YES, PRESIDENT TRUMP PUT ON

173
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:27,003
RUSSIANS, DEFINITELY MORE THAN

174
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:27,670
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

175
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,771
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT SEEMS LIKE

176
00:04:28,771 --> 00:04:31,407
HE'S READY TO MEET, HE SENDS THE

177
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:33,943
CONFLICTING MESSAGES, AS YOU

178
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:34,777
SAY.

179
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:36,145
SOME GETS TRAMPLED OVER.

180
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:38,481
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M READY TO LET

181
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:40,416
THEM BACK IN THE G7.

182
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,751
I GET WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO HE

183
00:04:41,751 --> 00:00:00,000
WANTS TO MAINTAIN A RELATIONSHIP
