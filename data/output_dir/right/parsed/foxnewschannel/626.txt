IN THE FIRES NOT FAR FROM
THE CITY OF ATHENS.
ALL RIGHT.
AINSLEY?
AINSLEY: THANK YOU, STEVE.
FROM AN APPARENT OVERDOSE
DESPITE INITIAL REPORTS
SOURCES TELLING FOX NEWS IT
WAS NOT HEROIN, ALTHOUGH WE
THE OPIOID REVERSAL DRUG
CALLED NARCAN AT THE SCENE.
DR. DANIEL BOBBER IS A
CERTIFIED ADDICTION MEDICINE
PHYSICIAN AND HE JOINS US
NOW WITH REACTION.
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
>> THANK YOU, AINSLEY, GREAT
TO BE HERE.
AINSLEY: YOU ARE WELCOME.
WE WANT TO SHED SOME LIGHT
ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S CLEARLY
A PROBLEM.
OPIOID DEATH CAUSE FOR
INJURY DEATH IN THE UNITED
SO MANY PEOPLE LOOK UP TO
THIS, PLEASE, WITH ALL YOUR
EXPERIENCE.
>> YOU KNOW, AINSLEY, THIS
IS A HORRIBLE EPIDEMIC, 120
PEOPLE A DAY OVERDOSE IN
THIS COUNTRY AND WE SPEND
$80 BILLION A YEAR IN TERMS
OF HEALTHCARE COSTS AND LOSS
OF PRODUCTIVITY.
SO, THIS SHOULD RAISE
AWARENESS IN OUR COUNTRY
ABOUT A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE
PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.
AND THERE IS TREATMENT IN
THE FORM OF DRUGS LIKE
METHADONE AND NORPHINE WHICH
HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO CUT THE
IS A LOT OF IGNORANCE IN THE
COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE DON'T
DEPENDENCE.
SO, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO
START LOOKING AT THE WAY WE
ARE TREATING PEOPLE AND
THIS WAS A HEROIN OVERDOSE.
THEN THERE WAS A STATEMENT
FROM HER FAMILY SAYING YOU
KNOW, EVERYTHING THAT'S
BEING REPORTED IS NOT
NECESSARILY TRUE.
THEN WE ARE HEARING FROM
FRIENDS THAT WERE THERE
SAYING IT WASN'T HEROIN.
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT NARCAN
WAS USED.
WOULD NARCAN BE USED FOR
ANOTHER DRUG OR DIFFERENT
TYPE OF OVERDOSE?
>> YOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES
NARCAN WILL BE USED DURING
AN OVERDOSE WHEN PAIR
MEDICINE DINGS, FOR EXAMPLE,
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DRUG IS
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HURT
IF THEY DID OVERDOSE ON
OPIOIDS THAT IS A WAY TO
HEROIN OR OTHER OPIOID BUT
AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW FOR
SURE.
AINSLEY: ARE YOU SEEING A
LOT OF INDIVIDUALS IN HER
AGE IN THEIR 20'S USING
HEROIN?
>> YOU KNOW, I SEE THIS
EVERY DAY IN MY OFFICE.
I SEE IT EVERY DAY IN THE
HOSPITAL.
THIS IS AN ILLNESS THAT
EFFECTS PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF
THEIR STATUS.
COMMUNITIES AND IT'S
AFFECTING US EVERY DAY.
PARENTS THAT HAVE KIDS THAT
ARE DEALING WITH THIS?
>> WELL, THAT THEY HAVE TO
GET TREATMENT.
VERY OFTEN THIS REQUIRES
RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT IN A
CONTROLLED SETTING.
AND IT CAN BE VERY COSTLY
AND VERY EXPENSIVE.
AND THIS IS WHY I CALL UPON
THE WHITE HOUSE AND
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO DO
AINSLEY: WHAT ARE THE
CHANCES PEOPLE CAN BE CLEAN
IF THEY DO HAVE AN ADDICTION
IF IT HAS A HOLD ON THEM?
>> ONE OF THE GREATEST MYTHS
ABOUT ADDICTION IS THAT IT
CAN'T BE TREATED.
YOU KNOW, ADDICTION IS NOT
TREATED THE SAME WAY, FOR
EXAMPLE, OR THOUGHT OF AS
THE SAME WAY AS HEART
DISEASE OR DIABETES.
YOU KNOW, IF SOMEONE TELLS
YOU THAT YOU HAVE -- SOMEONE
TELLS YOU THAT THEY HAVE AN
ADDICTION, WE TEND TO LOOK
AT THEM IN A STRANGE WAY.
SO, WE NEED TO ERASE THE
STIGMA OF ADDICTION.
BUT THE RATE OF TREATMENT
AND RELAPSE OR REMISSION IS
SIMILAR TO THINGS LIKE
DIABETES AND ASTHMA.
SO, WE CAN TREAT ADDICTION
THE SAME WAY WE TREAT ANY
OTHER MEDICAL ILLNESS.
COMPASSION AND NOT JUDGE
