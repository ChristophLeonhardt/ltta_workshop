[birds calling]

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,800
Hi, Judah.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,980
Things haven’t been
great for us so far.

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,030
Being away from you for
three years is killing me.

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,530
It seems like an eternity.

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,910
And Granny can’t come here
because of her car issues.

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,440
But this is the perfect
opportunity for us

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,150
to see each other
after such a long time.

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,860
I’m so excited and feel
like I’m a little kid.

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,120
See you soon.

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,935
Love, Mom.

13
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:48,430
[street noise]

14
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,927
We have to go!

15
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:50,925
Come on!

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,408
Can you wait for your sister?

17
00:00:59,408 --> 00:01:00,905
Is that what you wanted to say?

18
00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:02,402
Is she sitting with us too?

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,897
Let’s go.

20
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:07,891
[music]

21
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:47,312
Why is the road so bumpy?

22
00:01:47,312 --> 00:01:49,308
Look how far we
are from Richmond!

23
00:01:49,308 --> 00:01:52,302
I mean, Oakland.

24
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:53,799
(SINGING) Three, two, one.

25
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,290
And we went ablazing in
our favorite rocket ship

26
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,787
through the stars.

27
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,783
Do you want to [inaudible].

28
00:02:01,783 --> 00:02:02,781
Climb aboard.

29
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:05,276
Let’s get ready to depart.

30
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,530
OK, when you go in,
these people are

31
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,720
going to be very caring
to you, and they’re going

32
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,140
to ask to see your paperwork.

33
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,510
Just make sure you
have it with you.

34
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,960
And you’re going to go
through a metal detector.

35
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,190
It’s not scary.

36
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,857
You’re going to be fine.

37
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:51,324
Next, next, next family, please.

38
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:52,318
Next family.

39
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:53,809
Next family, please.

40
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:56,294
[crowd noise]

41
00:03:25,465 --> 00:03:25,965
Hey!

42
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:30,365
Hi.

43
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:33,885
[cries] I love you.

44
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:40,320
Come on.

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,300
I saw y’all coming.

46
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,310
What took y’all so long?

47
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,160
I couldn’t even bring her a
can of milk in or her wipes.

48
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,585
I had to take her wipes out.

49
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:49,020
Oh, she’s sleepy.

50
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:58,024
Look at the camera.

51
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:08,540
And then —

52
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,738
You gonna come live with me?

53
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:16,726
Mm-hmm.

54
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:23,187
I would like — may I have, how
about — they all look so good.

55
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:25,672
A green one.

56
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:27,163
I don’t want to drink it!

57
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:28,157
It’s good.

58
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:29,151
It’s ugly!

59
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:30,145
But it’s good.

60
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,139
[laughter]

61
00:04:34,618 --> 00:04:35,612
Good.

62
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:37,103
Oh, it didn’t hurt.

63
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,222
Are you going to
color in line style?

64
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:48,174
Anybody want some more pencils?

65
00:04:48,174 --> 00:04:51,126
[crowd noise]

66
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,062
“Inmates will stay out here.

67
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:58,014
After your families leave,
inmates will stay here.”

68
00:04:58,014 --> 00:04:59,908
Come here. Come here.

69
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:01,892
Thank you for coming.

70
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:03,020
I’m glad you were here.

71
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,368
I love you, buddy.

72
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:08,039
[inaudible] O.K.?

73
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:08,539
OK.

74
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:09,537
I love you.

75
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:57,836
[buzzing door]

76
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,430
It was fun.

77
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,150
But it wasn’t fun.

78
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,910
When I left, I tried
not to think about it

79
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,710
as much because I knew that
would just make me even more

80
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,740
emotional than I already am.

81
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,610
And there was nothing
I could do about it.

82
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,130
So it’s like, you have to
accept the fact that you

83
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,115
have to leave.

84
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:46,520
I’m kind of used to
this stuff because she’s

85
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,150
been in jail before.

86
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,000
And also, my dad left
me when I was three.

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,870
And he died when I was nine.

88
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,580
So it’s like, I’m sort of, kind
of getting used to the feel of,

89
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,410
like, getting hurt.

90
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,500
