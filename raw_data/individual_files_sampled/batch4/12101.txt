Media malfeasance is out of control president Trump moves to man bump stocks and we examine the other gun proposals are on the table talk about all of it i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show all righty so we have a lot to get to today the media had just been utterly irresponsible in their coverage of the entire parkland situation they are obviously pushing for gun control there are no many specific proposals but they're pushing as hard as humanly possible for gun control nonetheless I wanna talk about all of that including a smear by the huffington post against me personally a bunch of other smears against people who are pro-gun rights across the board and I want to talk a little bit about some people on the right who have made fools of themselves over the last couple of days but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at legacy box so if you are interested in preserving your family's memories which everyone should be legacy box is the way to do it I mean when as you get older especially how kids one of the things that you spend a lot of time thinking about is I wish I could remember when that happened and that's why you take all those pictures right but then those pictures go into storage maybe you printed them out and you stuck them in the garage somewhere all the stuff from when you were kids certainly is like that all the stuff from when your parents were kids absolutely is like that they're all on eight millimeter or on old film well that's what legacy boxes for so legacy box sends a box to your house you take all of those materials you label you put a shipping label on each of them and put a little bar code on each of them you take all of that you send it back to legacy box and they take all of those materials and they put it on an easy-to-access thumb drive or on a DVD for you so that you have access to the stuff at all times and you've just boiled down boxes and boxes of material into something you can carry around on a keychain it is a fantastic fantastic service and a deeply important one because you don't want to lose those memories it's never too early to start spring cleaning too so if you want to make sure that you've cleaned out your garage this is a good way to start you get the originals back and a couple of leaks with everything on a DVD or thumb drive ready to enjoy share and relive over 350,000

just a great way to preserve all those memories that otherwise will be lost so go to legacy box comm slash Ben couldn't endorse this service more highly legacy box comm slash Ben also so that they know that we sent you an to get that forty percent off and again the packages start at just $45 all right so I was gonna start today by discussing all of the various go proposals that are on the table but instead the media have forced me to discuss their absolute malfeasance throughout this entire debacle after the tragedy and the and the evil horror of what happened at parkland the media's first move was to jump to the suggestion that everyone who disagreed with them on gun control was of course in asking me now this is nothing new and I sort of got famous off of saying exactly this to Piers Morgan because Piers Morgan was famous for doing this I said to him that he was standing on the graves of the kids at Sandy Hook to push his agenda and the media continued to do this tonight of course CNN is supposed to have a big town hall event where they have a bunch of the students from Parkland we'll see if they have any of the students from power plants who are not in favor of gun control the answer is probably not but the media have been using these students in order to push their gun control agenda now I have never attempted to smear the students themselves I've never said that the students don't have a right to speak I have never insulted the students pain I've never insulted what the students went through but because I say that you ought to have expertise on the topic if we're going to take you seriously this is enough to get you labeled a smear of the students so Huffington Post led the way last night they put up a headline that looked like this and it's just egregious it says survivors mirrors with a picture of me personally and says some conservatives are trying to discredit outspoken Florida shooting survivors I have not tried to discredit any shooting survivor I have not smeared at any any shooting survivor that's absurd it's insulting and it's disgusting the only thing that I have said about the shooting survivors is the same thing that I said about Jimmy Kimmel when it came to him bringing his son on the show after his son went through an open-heart surgery which is just because you went through suffering does not make you an expert on a particular topic this has been my consistent stance on virtually every event of major consequence in the United States for my entire career is that just because he went through something doesn't mean that you have been conferred with certain expertise and that's what I wrote over at National Review I had a long piece on it I discussed it on the show but the idea that that is disrespect to the students to suggest that perhaps they don't know all the details what they're talking about or at the very least they have to show expertise in the topic for me to take their opinions more seriously I'm happy to take their opinions on what pain and suffering of people who've gone through a difficult situation looks like yeah they are experts and having gone through a traumatic situation so I'm happy to hear their advice on what it's like to go through a traumatic situation in fact I think that's deeply important stuff for people to hear but I'm not willing to to sacrifice the the point public policy on the basis of I went through something bad because that makes for bad public policy good public policy is not based on empathy good public policy is based on reason and logic but that of course is enough to get you labeled a smear of the survivors according to the mainstream media and they've been doing this for days I mean for days and days and days they've been doing this promoting lies about gun control promoting lies about people who oppose gun control and for example Van Jones who I personally know and I like van he's an opinion host but he retweeted may a tweet from a woman named Laurie shoot who tweeted common denominators for mass shooters white males under 30 a ar-15s Republicans so first of all maybe ar-15s maybe not that a bunch of other weapons that have been used in these mass shootings but there is no indicator that these mass shooters were Republicans even if you want to say that the powerclean shooter was a Republican because there's a picture of him more than a maganet well earlier this year or late last year we had a shooting in a congressional baseball game from Bernie Sanders supporter that didn't mean that Bernie Sanders was responsible for the shooting of the Congressional baseball players that's absurd but Van Jones retweeted that anyway and that's not the only example of the media covering themselves in glory Chris Cuomo earlier this morning made a fool of himself by tweeting something out that was patently false that Chris Cuomo tweeted out a story from an account called Cody Davis I guess us a photo dude and the tweet said quote I was able to buy an ar-15 in five minutes I'm 20 and my ID is expired well there's only one problem that never happened according to the article at self quote after the sales representative walked me through the paperwork all five pages of it I told him I changed my mind and wanted to think more before I bought an ar-15 he told me it wasn't a problem and listed the store hours if I wanted to come back and then said thank you and walked back to my car so in other words he didn't present an ID and no gun was offered to him he said that he wasn't going to present an ID he left this stored that was the end of the story it didn't matter Chris Cuomo tweeted out Eli that he was offered an ar-15 without photo ID now when he was called on this Chris Cuomo over at Siena and the the the block of wood who who attempts to resemble him and being over at CNN Chris Cuomo actually tweeted out isn't the point that the kids age and lack of ID wasn't the deterrent and this isn't all gun shops place I bought my shotgun basically goes farther than law requires and makes judgments about whom to sell to point is the system should be better well why and the system worked here he didn't try to eat and get a gun I'm wondering that they ran a federal background check if you go to a federally licensed firearms dealer in the United States according to federal law they must run a federal background check for a criminal record as well as mental health record by the way the problem is that these records are not fully transparent sometimes the information is not conveyed down to the federal government to the FBI so charles cook over at national review called cuomo on this he said the point is that the kid lied about buying a gun that you didn't and now you're lying - so Cuomo immediately misdirected - an unrelated topic he said lying if you want to fight back against background checks make the case whether it is calling the kids actors are lying about how no laws could stop the shootings that is the BS to call out 97% of people want better checks why fight that well it's a complete misdirect that has nothing to do with the fact that Chris Cuomo and respected objective news source tweeted out something that is objectively false it is just not true now in a second I'm going to talk about the stupidity of people on the right who are pushing myths about the about like people who actually are smearing this school the school shooting survivors by suggesting that one of them particularly a guy named David Hogg is 17 years old is some sort of crisis actor they're putting out this video that shows that he was interviewed by a local CBS News in Los Angeles a few months back over some incident where he was a witness and they're saying well this shows that he was a child actor because he was out in Los Angeles and so he's acting well he was at the shooting whether he is a child actor or not makes no difference I have no evidence that he is what the hell are you talking about is the suggestion that he's being paid for his perspective I mean my understanding is that from his Twitter account he was anti-gun before this happened is the idea that he's being paid as an actor to pretend that he saw a shooting he did not because there's no evidence of that either and that's a smear and that's a lie that's the number one trending video on YouTube by the way and it's disgusting anybody who's trafficking and trafficking and that should immediately be discounted as a decent news source that's stupidity there dinesh d'souza got himself in hot water yesterday because Dinesh tweeted something out about how the they're a bunch of kids were crying when a piece of gun legislation didn't pass in the Florida Legislature and Dinesh tweeted something out about how this is the worst these kids have suffered since their parents told them that they were scaling back their allowance or they couldn't get a summer job that of course is ridiculous there was literally a shooting in Florida last week Dinesh got shot for that as well he should have and hands it up backing down and apologizing for it but there's been inordinately dia focus placed on that YouTube video particularly and on the comments of folks like Dinesh hey every member of the mainstream media that's all deserve by the way I mean there should be focus on lies but the lies extend to the mainstream media itself and it's much more prominent in the mainstream media because virtually every major host in the mainstream media are engaging is engaging in this type of lie virtually all of them or at least in selective coverage that is designed to shade your emotions in a particular direction so as an example of this last night Anderson Cooper was was talking about gun violence about shootings involving guns and here's what he had to say I actually think we don't focus on the reality of what an ar-15 does to a child I mean if anyone has been on a battlefield and you've seen what a weapon like this does to a soldier I mean I think if people actually saw this and saw the reality of this I mean it's it would open people's eyes I mean we were talking about we're not talking about you know we all say all these children lost their lives they didn't lose their lives their lives were ripped out of their bodies their brains were splattered on the floor their intestines are hanging out I mean it's sickening and like we're all talking about it in this antiseptic way and we're shocked that these kids are angry when they've been hiding in closets and their friends are dead okay that's all fine I mean if he wants to discuss this in in graphic terms that's fine I'm not sure that the graphicness of the act actually changes the the logic behind gun control because the whole point here is not a lack of sympathy see what Cooper's trying to do a lot of folks in the media are trying to do is they're trying to say look how horrible things are therefore if you don't agree with me on policy it's because you don't think these things are horrible that's backwards logic and there's no real that there's no reason to it I'm gonna explain more about that and also I have an additional note for Anderson Cooper in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Dollar Shave Club so Dollar Shave Club is the place to go if you want the best shave you want that clean

dollarshaveclub.com slash then all right so Mac to Anderson Cooper so you heard Anderson Cooper there talk about the the brutality and the violence and the horrible imagery of kids being shot yes and all Americans agree that's terrible I will point out the selective coverage of the media when it comes to antiseptic coverage of killings so I did one one of the videos that I've done that's been seen the most is a video of me from this show talking in specific terms about what actually happens during an abortion the dismemberment of bodies in the womb in in late-stage abortion the the cracking open of the skull of babies and sucking their brains into sinks no one in the mainstream media will ever talk about that ever not in 1 million years the room that Anderson Cooper will never do a 30 second a 30 second description of what an abortion actually is like instead he will just use antiseptic terms to describe it the points your being that if the media want to get graphic about how they cover crime if the mean you want to get graphic about how they cover killings and violence then that's fine with me get graphic about how you cover crimes and killings and violence that's I have no problem with that as a general rule I think that in fact that's sometimes useful if people really are unable to connect what a crime is with the sure of the crime itself but you can't be selective about it you can't just say that you're gonna do it with regards to shooting victims but not with stabbing victims they're gonna do it with regard to shooting victims but not bombing victims we didn't hear a graphic descriptions of what happened to people on 9/11 right the news media and this actual critical of this the news media stopped showing that the the video of people who are hurling themselves from the top stories of buildings because they didn't want to lead people to to feel angry or feel bad and I said I don't like the media censoring that so I don't really have a problem with Anderson Cooper talking about the effective guns this is what it's true this is what a bullet fired at Hyde the high velocity does right it malls the human body it destroys the human body it destroys anything that it's shot at this is why the first rule literally the first rule of gun in training is do not point the gun at anything that you're not willing to destroy that is literally rule number one when it comes to guns if you pick up a gun then don't point it anywhere where it is possible that you will destroy something that you care about and that includes human beings this is what the NRA teaches in every one of its gun safety courses but the point is that the media are only doing this with regard to shootings now because they're pushing a particular political agenda and the problem here is that if you want to be an opinion host in to this that's fine if you want to say that you're an objective news host in to it that's a completely different story Brooke Baldwin doing the same routine over on CNN she was lecturing the Trump administration suggesting that the Trump administration was hiding somehow from from the media on all of this stuff even though that was not the case they had a press conference yesterday but here's Brooke Baldwin when the press conference is delayed by about 15 minutes saying that Sarah Huckabee Sanders in the White House were hiding from the media on gun control memo to the White House you cannot avoid us stop trying to dodge us this briefing needs to begin it was supposed to begin an hour and 15 minutes ago and then it was supposed to begin 25 minutes ago there was a lot to talk about and we need to see Sarah Sanders behind that podium Jeff's elleny and Gloria Borger are with me and I think it is entirely fair Jeff Zeleny to be tough on this White House because there are so many things they need to answer for before the ceremony at the half hour okay does that sound like objective news coverage here or does it sound like we want you out there so we can grill you on our preferred agenda with regard to guns and that's of course with the media continue to do so one reporter was grilling Sarah Huckabee Sanders yesterday suggesting that the president wasn't doing anything now as we will talk about the president actually is looking at doing some stuff with regard to guns it may not be all the things the left wants him to do because maybe he doesn't think those things are going to be particularly effective in stopping mass shootings one of the big problems with a lot of the gun control proposals that are being put on the table is that there is no clear link between the gun control proposal put on the table and the actual lessening of mass shootings the only gun control proposal that the left is really put on the table to to lessen mass shootings is confiscation of all guns which is completely unrealistic it's never going to happen and then if you say it's unrealistic and it's never gonna happen they accuse you of smearing shooting survivors or some such nonsense or not caring about the kids who died which again is total crap but here is what it looks like when the media grills the Obama administration on gun control working hand-in-hand with both the federal government as well as state and local law officials law enforcement officials on what we legally can do unfortunately we can't just flip a switch but there is a process there we are a law-and-order country and the president is trying to do everything that he can under his capacity to address these concerns and certainly when it comes to mental illness but the minute the media wouldn't have any of that they were just they were just grilling sarah huckabee senators how dare you not have a one-size-fits-all solution to to mass shootings and the answer is nobody does right even Obama said that when he was in office and he was pushing particularly gun control proposals like banning ar-15s for example he would say in his speeches this may not stop on mass shooting this may not stop any mass shootings he would say that sort of stuff and the media would just ignore that which leads a lot of donors to believe hey well if that it's not what you're doing then what exactly are you doing here now look the media obviously have an agenda here they have it and how they cover these stories they have it in the people they choose to interview there's a Katy tur over at MSNBC interviewed a guy who said that he was gonna become a school shooter but he didn't become a school shooter because he didn't have access to guns here's what that interview looked like some people blame this violence on the media or video games or music we call those people morons but there is one thing that would have made it all different I didn't have access to an assault rifle I was almost a school shooter I am NOT a school shooter because I didn't have access to guns guns don't kill people people kill people but people with guns kill lots of people you know that and then there's the guy who says that he was a would-be mass shooter well how do we know what would have stopped him and what would not have stopped him or if he'd like is it legal in the state of Colorado he's from Colorado for him to walk into a gun store at the age of 15 by rifle I don't know the gun laws in the state of Colorado I somehow doubt it but it doesn't matter this is the agenda and the agenda must be pushed at all costs regardless of the underlying facts it's it's just this is not how the media should be doing their jobs and they're not doing their jobs what they're doing is the job of the left and then they wonder it's so funny they sit around going Trump Trump attacks us and that's why our credibility is shot with the American people their credibility was shot long before Trump in 2012 Newt Gingrich made a lot of hay he won a couple of primaries based on him in the in the debate criticizing the media I said at the time that if anyone wanted to win primaries they should criticize the media I've been saying that for years Trump was the only one who did it on a regular basis and he tapped into something that was a pre-existing wellspring of distrust of the media that exists specifically because it is obvious that they are pushing a political agenda CNN doing this routine scene that's been the worst of all the network's on this I mean it's just been garbage on this CNN is now pushing an agenda saying that 16 year old should vote here's here's what they tweet it out and then they suggested that it says should 16 year olds be able to vote the response it's Stoneman Douglas High is showing that youth in this country can and should have a significant role in political debate rights law professor Joshua Douglas via CNN opinion really is that what it shows because what it seems to me is what it shows that you are willing to use as the media the most sympathetic person that you can find in order to promulgate your agenda that's that's what it is saying to me because here's what the data say to me the data say to me that 18 to 29 year olds are more pro-gun than people who are older so it's funny then the media will never report these polls 2015 Pew survey these put up by Lachlan Marquis over at Daily Beast found 18 to 29 year olds are less likely than older Americans to support a ban on assault weapons just 49 percent of Millennials were for the assault weapons ban compared the 55 percent of 30 to 49 year old 61 percent to 50 to 64 year olds and 63 percent of those 65 and older meanwhile 18 to 29 year olds lead the country in support for concealed carry according to a 2015 Gallup poll they're more likely to support the practice of carrying a hidden firearm in public by a full 10 at 66% so the idea that all these kids are sitting around looking to seize the guns no it's just that you wanna you want to feature certain children it's not that you care that 16 year olds but you don't want 16 year olds to vote now you want 16 year olds to be treated as children when they commit crimes but adults when it comes to voting it doesn't work that way either kids or kids or kids or adults it can't have it both ways but obviously the media's agenda here uber alles that's all that that's all that matters in the end is how the media decides to cover all of this stuff and that's just it's just gross it's just gross because not about providing the American public with information it's about providing them with a fully created narrative that is going to be used to club all rivals into submission okay meanwhile the the Trump is actually doing stuff so Trump yesterday said that who's gonna move to ban bub stocks that doesn't make a lot of sense in response to the parklands shooting but it does make some sense in response to Las Vegas shooting I suggested it at the time bump stocks are a an addendum that you can put on the back on the butt of a rifle that essentially allows the the rifle to move back and forth against your shoulder very quickly and if you hold your finger steady then the trigger hits your finger all right so the trigger it goes like that over and over and over very very quickly using the momentum from the from the kickback of the gun to to power that sort of bouncing action so the shooter in Las Vegas used a bump stock there was no bomb stock ban on the books Trump says yesterday that he's going to move to drop regulations to ban bump stocks Attorney General to clarify whether certain bump stock devices like the one used in Las Vegas are illegal under current law that process began in December and just a few moments ago I signed a memorandum directing the Attorney General to propose regulations to ban all devices that turn legal weapon okay so it is not clear by the way that attack is actually legal for the DOJ to use existing law and order ban bump stocks you might need a separate piece of legislation because the gun itself is not a machine gun this is an addendum to a a semi-automatic weapon it's a piece that you add to a semi-automatic weapon for those in the media who don't understand the difference between my auto and in Auto a semi auto means that when every trigger pole is one round that is chambered and fired and in an automatic weapon means that the law as long as you're holding down the trigger multiple bullets are being fired so that's the difference between the two the white house also said that they would look into the possibility of raising the age limit for purchase of ar-15 type rifles again there's certain inconsistency here if you're gonna raise the age limit for buying a rifle then you should also raise the age limit for presumably joining the military maybe or or voting the bottom line is our 18 year olds adults are they're not adults right now we have very inconsistent view of when people become adults you're 18 for purposes of voting but you're 21 for purposes of drinking and I'm not sure how that works exactly so you can you can be in the military and at 18 years old but you can't actually have a beer until you're 21 that's a sort of weird thing or you can be in the military at 18 but you can't leave the military and then go purchase a rifle even though you were just in the military there's a little bit of incoherence there I'm not completely opposed to the idea of raising the age limit on this stuff but I'm not sure that it's going to have a tremendous effect given though the laws around the nation already with regard to to buying ar-15s there was a lot of hubbub yesterday after Florida voted down in the salt weapons ban as well we'll talk about that in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at filter by so in Dallas it's 11 degrees New York's been nine degrees Minneapolis minus two degrees it's really really really cold outside LA is really cold right now for no reason at all and that means everybody's indoors and that means that you're using your heating system in all likelihood well instead of you sitting there breathing in dirty air because you haven't replaced your filters in a while now you need to go to filter by comm it is America's leading provider of HVAC filters for homes and small businesses filter by comm carries over 600 different filter sizes including custom options all ship free within 24 hours plus they are manufactured right here in America filter by offers a multitude of em ERV options all the way up to hospital grades you'll be removing a dangerous pollen mold dust other allergy aggravating pollution while maximizing the efficiency of your system right now you can save five percent when you set up auto delivery so you never need to think about air filters again again that's filter by comm filter bu why.com go there make sure that the air that your kids are breathing is the safe and cleanest air possible even me spending a lot of time indoors and usually the air indoors is dirtier than the air outdoors so make sure that's not the case at your house filter by calm again filter by calm and right now you say five percent when you setup auto delivery so you'll never need to think about it again after you go to over to filter by comm and register okay so other things that are that are on the table Florida just voted down and I full-on quote unquote assault weapons ban it wasn't an assault weapons ban that's that's bad media coverage again instead it was actually a ban on air 15s ar-15s are not assault weapons yeah assault weapons are a legally dubious definition there's no clear definition of what constitutes an assault weapon an ar-15 is just a high grade rifle that's all it is but if you add a few gadgets to it it becomes an assault weapon if you have like a pistol grip to it to a rifle then in in some cases that becomes an assault weapon if you add a sight to it sometimes it becomes an assault weapon if it's painted black as opposed to being brown sometimes that's an assault weapon in any case this made a lot of media a lot of garnered a lot of media attention because that bunch of the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school went to Florida lawmakers in Tallahassee and asked for a full ban on the outter 15 the final motion vote was 36 to 70 once was overwhelmingly voted down the Democratic Representative Keyon McGee asked for a procedural move that would have allowed it to consider the ban and the bill to ban quote assault rifles in large capacity magazines the bill had been assigned to three committees but was not scheduled for a hearing so the house will determine whether they choose to do that or not obviously the media ran with the photos of the Weeping students because they want to generate sympathy for the anti-gun agenda and this doesn't mean the student should be mocked as Dinesh did yesterday obviously I understand that kids have really strong feelings about everyone has very strong feelings about these issues and these kids just went through a trauma that's why I'm not in favor of what I think his media exploitation of people who just went through a tragedy in order to gin up sympathy for a particular agenda I think that the media only does this again with particular circumstances they didn't do it after the Boston bombing they didn't have big town halls with victims of the Boston bombing talking about immigration policy for example but they do do this every time there is a gun and in an issue of gun violence that crops up by the way worthwhile noting here that some of the statistics that have been going around regard to mass shootings in the United States are just that wrong as I've explained before it is just not true it is it is a falsity that there were 18 mass shootings in the United States in January it's not true it was more like two that's horrible but it's not 18 also it's been promoted by the media that the United States the only advanced country in which mass violence occurs that mass shootings occur that is not true if you actually look per capita if you look per capita mass shootings the United States actually comes in eleventh so the way that you calculate that this is the crime prevention Research Center headed by economist John Lott who's famously the author of more guns less crime which has been true in the United States for a while the gun the gun murder rate has been declining rapidly in the United States for the last 20 years even though the number of guns in circulation in the United States has been rising rapidly for the last 20 years John Lott says that the u.s. does not lead the world in mass shootings in fact it doesn't even make the top ten when you measure death rate per million population from mass public shootings now to be fair there's a fair margin of error here because mass shootings everywhere are pretty rare when you have a country of 330 million people and let's say a hundred people a year are killed in mass shootings which is very high that's not high that number is a lot higher than it actually is in the United States well that that recedes into margin of error territory but if you look at 2009 through 2015 if you look at the top death rate per million people from mass public shootings goes Norway Serbia France Macedonia Albania Slovakia Switzerland Finland Belgium Czech Republic and then the United States also as far as frequency that is also not true the u.s. ranks 12th compared to European countries in terms of frequency per capita now per capita matter is because the United States is a very large country with a lot of people and so you're going to have to measure the rate of violence in the United States as opposed to rates of violence per capita in other European countries so don't buy into the the notion that the United States is replete with mass shootings there happening every day on every corner does that mean that there's nothing we can do to stop it no of course it doesn't mean that I've suggested on this program multiple things we can do ranging from better security in school situations to the gun violence restraining orders promoted by David French over at National Review in which family members can apply to the court to have your capacity to buy a gun or own a gun temporarily removed from you if you're a danger to yourself or others but that's not enough the left just wants to shout about how everybody who doesn't agree with them is a bad person and they're not going to stop until that happens this is this is a fool's errand for the White House for the White House is is gonna hold a listening session with students according to Sara Huckabee Sanders this is because the media been putting a lot of pressure on the White House saying you're not listening to the victims you're not listening to the victims again I don't remember anybody doing this with Barack Obama and for example the victims in Benghazi I don't remember them doing this with the victims of the Boston bombing I don't remember the I don't remember of the family of the the beheaded by Isis doing this with Barack Obama but I guess we have to do this with with President Trump Sarah Huckabee Sanders says Trump is actually gonna get in a room with a lot of these students and presumably take it from them Trump is actually good at this it'll be good for Trump politically you know the aftermath probably won't be heavy gun legislation but it's smart of him politically to get in a room with these kids because Trump contrary to popular opinion does have a capacity for sympathy when he is listening to people one-on-one is virtually everyone who's dealt with him one-on-one will tell you here's Sarah Huckabee Sanders announcing this tomorrow will be hosting parents teachers and students here at the White House to discuss efforts to ensure safety at our schools members of the Parkland community will be attending this listening session as will individuals who were impacted by past school shootings including the Columbine and Sandy Hook tragedies on Thursday we will be hosting local officials including members of the law enforcement community to continue that conversation as the president has said many times it is the right of every American child to grow up in a safe community that begins in America's neighborhoods okay so this is I think a smart move by the Trump administration to demonstrate that there's no lack of sympathy even if there is a lack of agreement on public policy some of the agreement on public policy the lack of agreement is coming from the fact that folks on the Left refused to even consider possibilities that they haven't thought about right so Doug Jones the the senator from Alabama he was asked about the possibility of arming teachers and I've said that I think the teachers who are trained and qualified should be able to carry firearms Doug Jones says all that's idiotic we shouldn't arm teachers I'm not even consider it forming teachers in schools and that's an idea that representative Bradley Bern and Senator Doug Jones had when opinions about there are some teachers that I think could be appropriately armed if they have the training they feel comfortable doing it I would certainly wouldn't want to require them to do it if they don't feel comfortable with it I think that's a dumbest idea I've ever heard I think it's crazy you don't need to arm America in order to stop this well actually you do need to arm Americans in order to stop mass shooters because it's always the police who stopped mass shooters but again this is this debate is so dishonest and it's so yucky and really it turns your guts because there are so many people who are well who are not willing to lend the other side the credibility of hearing out the their their proposals or willing to acknowledge the people on the other side of the issue may in fact care about children being killed okay so speaking of media bias let's talk a little bit about a new poll that's out with regard to the GOP tax cut so there's an brand new poll that's out and it shows that the GOP tax cut is up to 51% support overall from 37% in December 89% among Republicans and 19% among Democrats okay that is a massive growth in the in the level of support for the tax cuts in one of the reasons is because people are finally starting to see the tax cuts hit their paycheck they got their February paycheck and the tax cuts were present in the paycheck and so suddenly it's more popular it also goes to show you the level of media lies and malfeasance on the tax cut and you can see that at a time I talked about this while they were passing the tax cut you could actually see in the polls the vast majority of the American public thought they would not receive a tax cut still only thirty five percent of the American public believes that they're going to receive a tax cut it's closer to eighty to ninety percent of the American public and then the media wonder why we don't trust them why we think that they're biased on these issues they are biased on these issues and I'll show you how bias they are also on the Trump brushes stuff in just a

conservative podcast in the nation speaking of Trump Russia collusion there's another robert mueller investigation indictment somebody has pled guilty again it has nothing to do with actual collusion between the Trump administration and Russia and the last few weeks have not been good for people who have been pushing the lie that the Trump administration was clearly colluding with referent out maybe there will be no evidence that emerges maybe we will find out later that the Trump administration was working hand in glove with Vladimir Putin to swivel the election in Wisconsin maybe that's what we'll find out but I haven't seen the evidence of that you haven't seen the evidence of that because nobody's seen the evidence that but that is not actually stopping members of the Democratic Party in the media from pushing that lie anyway Hakeem Jeffries the Democratic Representative he came out yesterday said that Trump did collude to steal the election but we also have to stay focused here on what the problem is it seems that the Trump campaign conspired with Russian spies to sell out our democracy and now you have members closely affiliated with the Trump administration and possibly the president who are engaged in a cover-up that's a problem and we should just allow the Muller investigation to run its course okay I'm in favor of allowing another investigation run its course but it seems like you're jumping to conclusions there I came I mean yeah you you are you're you're suggesting something that is just not an evidence you're assuming facts not in evidence so yesterday President Trump tweeted out that he was that he had been much tougher on Russia than President Obama had been fact-check true the media ran with the most bizarre headline so look at this from CNN this is a clip 17 look at this from CNN you'll see a headline that they put up okay the one on the Left says Trump has been tougher on Russia in in then then Obama was in eighth they he's been tougher on Russia in in the first in one year than Obama wasn't eight and then it says in parentheses right there fact-checking in the chyron in the parentheses says no he hasn't and Natasha Bertrand who covers the media says Ciena not pulling any punches tonight um that's not only them not pulling punches that's them lying trump has been tougher on Russia in one year than the Obama administration wasn't it I love this idea that suddenly the Obama administration was tough on Russia in 2012 President Obama running for reelection said directly to Dmitry Medvedev that he should commit that he should tell Vladimir Putin that there would be more flexibility after the election if the Russians backed off he said that on and and Mike he said that Mitt Romney who is calling Russia the number one geopolitical threat the 1980s called him want their foreign policy back then he handed over leadership of the Syrian situation to the Russians and the Russians have continued to prop up a regime that is engaging in massive human rights violation certain human rights violations so massive that the UN literally put out a resolution I think two days ago saying that we have no more words condemned what's happening in Syria that's what the resolution actually said and yet we're now being told that Obama was tougher on Russia then Trump was Obama wasn't even in tough on Russia interfering in the election right Obama the Trump has a point here he does have a point when he says that you know if Russia was interfering the election so much where was Obama well they were interfering in the election and where was Obama and the answer is that Obama didn't want to piss off the Russians because he thinks that the Russians were a valuable strategic Ally on the Iran deal that's the reality of why he didn't want to tick off the Russians he thinks that the Russians should have a leadership role in the Middle East so CNN is lying about that too when they said oh but that Obama was tougher on Russia than Trump is it's just a joke it's not true Jonah Goldberg okay another person who is not Pro Trump right I am NOT by any stretch of the imagination if you've ever listened to the show a president Trump Lackey neither as Jonah Goldberg at National Review I don't think either one of us voted for President Trump in fact I know neither one of us did here is what he writes he says there's one unfortunate thing with the Trump tweet Trump has a point Barack Obama sold out our Eastern European allies on missile defense he slowed off 280 Ukraine as opposed to Trump who's actually provided material aid Ukraine he did a little more than shrug when Crimea was annexed he said never mind on his own red line in Syria and turned a blind eye to Putin's intervention there in large part because of his obsessions of getting the Iran deal the Russian meddling in our elections started on Obama's watch and not just our elections but those of many of our allies when Romney famously said Russia was our number one geopolitical foe Obama mocked him for it as did countless liberal journalists were now converts to anti-russia horary meanwhile the Trump administration has made life harder for Russia diplomatically and economically thanks to revving up our oil and gas production it hasn't been as tough as some including me would like but it's been tougher than the Obama administration or at least it's not unreasonable so the the reason that that the media are mocking Trump on this stuff is because Trump has said so many nice things about Putin and because he seems to lend a lot of credibility to Putin this is another case there's so many cases in the Trump administration where a good policy is at odds with bad rhetoric where policy is actually pretty good decent in some cases great and then he goes out and says something dumb and he undermines the policy but the media are lying when they say to you that Obama was tough on Russia and Trump is not tough on Russia it's just not true it is not factually accurate doesn't matter media will live out it anyway Jim sciutto over at over at CNN says it's delusional to say the Trump has been facing down Russia listen you know you can argue and it's a fair criticism to say did the Obama administration act quickly or strong enough strongly enough with Russia and that's a criticism you've heard from both Democrats and Republicans but when you compare the Trump administration response basically this president's response and the Obama administration's response Mr Sanders is entering really delusional territory there come no it's not okay so if you want to say that the the Trump administration response to Russian election meddling has been lackluster at best I agree if you want to say the Trump administration response to Russia generally has been weaker than the Obama administration that is just not true and it's foolish and again you wonder why people don't trust the media because you keep lying because people in the media keep lying I think the truth on all sides would be a good thing I have criticized President Trump when I think that he is not telling the truth and I have criticized the media land I think they are not telling the truth right now the media are doing themselves no favors especially because they shouldn't be in the business of pushing an agenda Trump's agenda isn't to tell truth Trump's agenda is to push Trump's agenda and from Sargento very often is to push Trump well that means sometimes is gonna be dishonest just like other politicians are dishonest in some cases more so but CNN's agenda was supposed to be objective truth which they are not providing on any level at this point their coverage in the last couple of weeks has been really disheartening these are the people who say an apple is an apple not a banana well then stop creating apple banana smoothies and calling them apples because it's just ridiculous it's just ridiculous no have you ever miss if I didn't take a minute to note the death of the world's best-known evangelist Reverend Billy Graham he died on Wednesday he was 99 years old and he was responsible for an enormous amount he was using who's responsible for an enormous number of conversions an enormous number of celebrities came to came to Christianity through Billy Graham and Billy Graham it was not the media tried to portray him in many cases this sort of this sort of odd this odd Elmer Gantry character that's not who Billy Graham was miligrams lectures it was it was deeply not only religious stuff but stuff about self-sacrifice and stuff about responsibility Billy Graham had a great impact on the world this is why when people talk about how religion has had a nasty impact on the world look at the followers of Billy Graham and ask how many followers of Billy Graham have made their lives better because of the thought because they followed Billy Graham there's in the aftermath of tragedy there's an easy swing toward atheism agnosticism the idea that you'd be better off if you didn't believe in God better people don't believe in God that somehow the world would be better if a theism were to rule the roost we've heard this from thinkers I respect including Sam Harris and Steven Pinker in the last couple of days and this is not true for the vast majority of individuals around planet Earth people who become atheistic are less likely to engage in communal activities people who become an atheistic are less likely to give to charity people who become atheistic are less likely to to engage in the sort of social fabric building that's necessary in order for a thriving society to survive and that's not even a case for the veracity of Christianity or Judaism that I'm making this is a case for the social utility of Christianity or Judaism all the folks who are living in a free and open and and good country can thank people like Billy Graham for turning the lives around of people many people who would otherwise have have led terrible lives I mean they're there a lot of people who were who were hell-bent on leading bad lives and Billy Graham was instrumental in preventing that from happening as are so many other religious leaders now that doesn't mean that religion is always a force for good of course not it doesn't mean that religion always makes people better that would be silly it does mean that religion when used properly can be a solution to a lot of people's life problems and it can be an encouragement to do better because there is someone who expects something more of you and it's not just your friends or family it's not even just you it's a higher power that expects you to make something of your life and discover a purpose I think the death of God in American society has been a contributing factor to the sort of political fractious nough seen here we used to at least hold it in common not only that we were all made in God's image but that if we all help common values in common we knew our neighbors cared about the dead kids in Sandy Hook or cared about the the murdered children in parkland right we took that for granted because these were the same people that we saw at church every week these are the same people who are giving to the same charities that we were but because we've lost that communal space it's a lot easier to in your house and go on Twitter or Facebook and malign people who you've never met because you've never met your neighbors how many of us have actually met our neighbors now in California it's become really uncommon I know that there's still places in the country where you know your neighbors particularly in small town America I grew up in Los Angeles knowing your neighbors was not a prereq one of the things that you see when you drive through different areas of the country it's really fascinating is which areas have fences between yards and which don't so if you go over to Dallas for example big city but if you drive around suburban Dallas there are no fences between the actual yards and all the yards are basically connected there may be some driveways but they're not big fences if you drive through the valley and which is which is where I've lived most of my life you drive through the San Fernando Valley well you'll see is that most of the yards are not connected most of the yards are separated by walls most of the yards are separated by fences they're fenced off there's nothing wrong with the wall there's nothing wrong with the fence but it is indicative of the fact that community is less common in big cities than it is in small towns and it's less it's less common in urban areas than it is in rural areas and it's less common in non-religious areas than it is in religious areas this is why you've seen in the last few years the rise in atheist get-togethers they've been trying to create almost an atheistic religious get-together where you have community events and all the rest of us and it hasn't been working because why should a theist get together to talk about why God doesn't exist that seems like a rather uninspiring vision of the world why would you get together with people who also don't believe God exists that frees you to find any purpose in life supposedly but you're gonna end up with a lot of different purposes and a lot of those purposes are going to be working at cross-purposes with one another so Billy Graham's death is a reminder that building the social fabric is one of the chief roles of religion particularly American religion Billy Graham's life is pretty amazing every year since 1955 grandmas on galip's list of most admired men and women according to Hank Barry and over the Daily wire his fierce hatred of segregation meant churches had to integrate for his revivals as far back as 1953 when in a revival in Jackson Mississippi uh sure set up ropes to segregate the races Graeme asked for the ropes to be removed when the usher refused Graham took them down himself and told all the people to sit where they wanted at a Madison Square revival in 1957 he invited Martin Luther King to preach together as King said quote had it not been for the ministry of my good friend dr. Billy Graham my work in the civil rights movement would not have been successful at it as it has been Graham often paid the bill the Bay and finds that King received when he was in jail is again one of the lies about the civil rights movement he was pushed by a bunch of atheist is pushed by a bunch of religious leaders dr. Martin Luther King was a reverend Reverend Billy Graham was a reverend he was born November 7th 1918 the oldest of four children born to Morrow coffee and William Franklin Graham senior he grew up on a dairy farm near Charlotte North Carolina as a child he loved to read books and in 1933 his father forced him and his sister to drink beer until they got sick which prompted both children who swore off alcohol and drugs for the rest of their lives children were raised differently back in 1933 the next year having seen the evangelist Mordecai ham he was converted by him he went to Bob Jones College in Tennessee where who's almost expelled but Jones told him quote at best all you could announce would be a poor country Baptist preacher somewhere out in the sticks you have a voice that pulls God can use that voice of yours he can use it mightily and so Graham transferred to Florida Bible Institute he preached his first sermon at Bostwick Baptist Church in 1937 and became a national figure in 1949 when he held a series of revivals in LA and had circus tents erected in the parking lot which led to national media coverage and he hosted TV of course from 1947 until 2005 it's worthwhile paying honored to a man who did a lot more good than he did bad in this world built Reverend Billy Graham okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like I've started the show Longmire which has been recommended to me on Netflix is it the best show I've ever seen no I mean I've only seen the pilot episode I tend to like I tend to like less episodic shows where you don't wrap up a plot in one episode but it is well written and it is kind of taciturn Western so I love westerns you put on the cowboy hat and you and you have a guy speaking in short phrases with with fun profundity and I'm into it so that's what Longmire is so check out Longmire he's a little bit of preview don't matter if you're in the city or the country crime don't change there are always suspects what about the girl move around some folks like you can't find it I asked you a very simple question and there are two types of people that like to kill from a distance cowards and pros there are always victims afraid I have some very bad news okay so it's that kind of show right if you like that kind of voice you like that kind of show it's pretty simple so you can check out Longmire over at Netflix where it is now available okay other things that I like so nikki Haley I gave a speech yesterday at the UN the Mahmoud Abbas the Palestinian dictator because he is now in the what 17 let's see I think he's elected 2005 so he is now in the thirteenth year of a four-year tenure so that's exciting he had told nikki Haley are you an ambassador - shut up she came out yesterday firing again nikki Haley at the UN is my spirit animal so here she is I sit here today offering the outstretched hand of the United States to the Palestinian people in the cause of peace we are fully prepared to look to a future of prosperity and coexistence we welcome you as the leader of the Palestinian people here today but I will decline the advice I was recently given by your top negotiator Saeb Erekat I will not shut up rather I will respectfully speak some hard truths okay love it nikki Haley doing yeoman's work over at the UN so that is fantastic stuff nikki Haley is the best okay a quick thing that I hate so Alyssa Milano came out and and tweeted about the Second Amendment and what she tweeted about the Second Amendment was a particularly stupid thing so when she tweeted out was it said also pushy said also popular in 1791 the year the Second Amendment was adopted and then it's a list of things slavery the three-fifths compromise bloodletting LED paints being literally owned by her husband cholera smallpox typhus dying in childbirth a lot using chamber pots unsanitary surgical procedures traveling by horse or foot dying at the age of 40 things change y'all we can do better hey I wasn't aware that smallpox was actually popular in 1791 as a people had smallpox parties they got together and they said oh you got that hot smallpox passing on man just hand me the smallpox dying in childbirth also not aware that that was supremely popular in 1791 I think people saw that as bad in 1791 even slavery which was popular in certain parts of the United States and 1791 was certainly not popular in certain other parts of the United States in 1791 but if you're going to talk about things that are in the Constitution of the United States which seems to me closer than smallpox to resemblance to the Second Amendment try the First Amendment other things that were popular on in 1791 freedom of religion freedom of speech no quartering of troops no illegal search and seizures a right to a jury trial a right against a right against a torturer right these were things that were pretty popular in 1791 it turns out cuz they're in that same document you stupid idiot so that again there's it there's a notion on the left that all of time began with their birth I remember the Barack Obama said something about how Bill Ayers what Bill Ayers did before he met Bill Ayers was irrelevant because Bill Ayers basically didn't exist as a human right Billy Ayers did all this stuff when I was a kid okay so what so what the world didn't start turning when you were born but folks on the Left seemed to start seem to think that all of the good things in life began just spontaneously when they were born or discovered them and that they never pre-existed that the same ideology the same philosophy that brought you freedom of speech and freedom of religion brought you the right to keep and bear arms they were part and parcel of the same philosophy as far as the the notion that three-fifths compromise was some sort of ideological with some sort of ideological commitment to the non peoplehood of black people that's idiocy if you look at the actual negotiations over the three-fifths compromise which is a bad provision of the Constitution the reason that it is in the Constitution is because it was there to prove a worst provision of the Constitution which would have been counting black people as full people for purposes of voting but counting them as property for purposes of not being able to actually vote or do anything that's what the South wanted the South wanted slave owners wanted that if there were a bunch of black folks were living in slavery in South Carolina for purposes of representation in the Congress for South Carolina black folks would be counted as people but they would not be able to vote they would still be considered property and the North said no we're not going to do that you don't get to count black people as full people excuse me because it's skews the representative sample if the North had came to that and said sure black people are full people for purposes of representation but not people for purposes of property guess what slavery would have lasted longer because the South would have had more votes in the Congress but again knowledge and historical and historical learning are apparently somehow there a lot of folks on the Left who are allergic to them they kill a lot of the narratives they love so much alrighty so we'll be back here tomorrow from CPAC I'm speaking at CPAC and I will have I promised some notes on CPAC but I ran out of time again today I'll have some notes on CPAC C PAC apparantly quick note just ban they just got rid of Jim Hoffs is one of the speakers over to Gateway pundit because Jim Hoffs had been tweeting out stupidities about the the school shooting victims in parkland I think that is perfectly appropriate as far as Mary and lepen who's been invited I'm not sure why Marian lepen is representative of conservatism I didn't book her I wouldn't have booked her that said I'm more than happy to speak to the thousands of students who are going to hear about some real conservatism and that's an opportunity I look forward to having tomorrow at CPAC so if you're at CPAC in the Washington DC area show up and I'll see you there I'm Ben Shapiro this the
