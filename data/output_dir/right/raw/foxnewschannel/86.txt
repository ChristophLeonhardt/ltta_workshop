ANN COULTER, POST OF KENNEDY ON

THE FOX BUSINESS NETWORK.

7
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:15,415
FROM UTAH CONGRESSMAN, AND

8
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:20,186
AUTHOR OF BOOK, THE DEEP STATE,

9
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,188
-- JASON CHAFFETZ.

10
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,725
BY THE WAY, WHY DID WE MENTION

11
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:26,559
THE BOOK, WE NEED TO DO THAT?

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,894
>> I WAS WONDERING THAT.

13
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:30,797
WE WILL GET TO IT LATER.

14
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:34,100
FROM NEW YORK FOX NEWS

15
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:34,834
CONTRIBUTOR, TAMMY BRUCE.

16
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:35,735
TAMMY, I WILL BRING YOU AT

17
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:40,106
FIRST BECAUSE YOU ALL THE WAY

18
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:40,907
OVER THERE, I JUST WANT TO

19
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,075
START ANY DISCUSSION ON

20
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:42,542
IMMIGRATION.

21
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:50,183
WITH A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT.

22
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:51,951
FOR ME PERSONALLY WHICH IS THAT

23
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:52,418
BASICALLY, I AM

24
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:52,886
PRO-IMMIGRATION.

25
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:55,388
MY FAMILY FLED COMMUNISM IN

26
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,055
HUNGARY.

27
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,490
SOME OF THEM LITERALLY CLIMBING

28
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:58,224
OVER FENCES AS WE HAVE SEEN AS

29
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:58,892
REFUGEES FROM THE COMMUNIST

30
00:00:58,893 --> 00:00:59,259
INVASION.

31
00:00:59,260 --> 00:00:59,993
NOW I AM AN IMMIGRANT HERE

32
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:00,393
TWICE OVER.

33
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,029
SO IT HAS TO BE CONTROLLED IF

34
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,030
THERE WILL BE IMMIGRATION IT'S

35
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,765
QUITE CLEAR THAT IMMIGRATION

36
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,067
HAS BEEN OUT OF CONTROL AND

37
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,037
THESE SCENES WE ARE WITNESSING,

38
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:16,109
IT JUST TOTALLY EMPHASIZE THE

39
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:16,743
POINT OF CONTROL.

40
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,111
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE

41
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:18,845
CAN LOOK AT THOSE PICTURES AND

42
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:21,948
NOT BE INCREDIBLY ALARMED OF

43
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:22,415
WHAT'S GOING ON.

44
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,651
>> LOOK, THE LACK OF REAL

45
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:25,385
POLICY HERE IN THE UNITED

46
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:29,322
STATES, THE LACK OF CONTROL,

47
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,223
THE EFFECTIVE THROUGH THE OBAMA

48
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:33,359
MINISTRATION, THE EFFECT OF

49
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,093
OPEN BORDER HAS ENCOURAGED THIS

50
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:38,064
NOW FOR HALF A GENERATION.

51
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:39,799
AND YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE

52
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,567
PICTURES, THE CHILDREN, PEOPLE

53
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:41,501
HUDDLING, THE DANGERS INVOLVED.

54
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,803
EFFECTIVELY, IT IS AN ABUSE OF

55
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:44,337
PROCESS THAT EXISTS.

56
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:47,540
BECAUSE WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT

57
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,374
THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME

58
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:53,012
POLITICAL GAIN TO BE HAD BY

59
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:53,713
HAVING THE IMAGES, THAT THEY

60
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:54,514
CAN BE USED POLITICALLY.

61
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:55,281
JUST LIKE WITH THE KAVANAUGH

62
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:55,815
SITUATION.

63
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:56,783
OTHER PEOPLES LIVES DON'T

64
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:00,420
MATTER TO THE ESTABLISHMENT.

65
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:00,987
YOU SEE THE FRAMEWORK.

66
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:01,921
WE OF COURSE HAVE ABANDONED

67
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:05,358
POLICIES FOR CENTRAL AND SOUTH

68
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:05,792
AMERICA.

69
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,026
TO DEAL WITH CORRUPT REGIMES

70
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:10,997
WHERE THERE IS HORRIBLE

71
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:11,965
DYNAMICS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE

72
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:12,298
FLEEING.

73
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,000
BUT THE SOLUTION THAT DONALD

74
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,034
TRUMP IS COME UP WITH IS A GOOD

75
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:15,301
ONE.

76
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,202
IF YOU HAVE A SAFE NATION THAT

77
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:25,545
WILL ACCEPT REFUGEE STATUS FOR

78
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:26,279
YOU, THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

79
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,013
GET IT AT THE UNITED STATES

80
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:27,347
BORDER.

81
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:28,047
AND THAT IS IMPORTANT.

82
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:28,881
IF THIS IS REALLY ABOUT REFUGEE

83
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:29,716
FRAMEWORK, THE INTERNATIONAL

84
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:30,984
SCENE RECOGNIZES THIS AS THE

85
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:36,623
VERY NEXT SAFE COUNTRY AND FOR

86
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:37,390
THESE INDIVIDUALS, IT IS

87
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,258
MEXICO, IT IS NOT THE UNITED

88
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:38,658
STATES.

89
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,392
AT LEAST THERE IS FRAMEWORK OF

90
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,426
A STRUCTURE THE PRESIDENT IS

91
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:40,793
MOVING IN.

92
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:41,861
HE WAS RIGHT IN HIS TWEET THAT

93
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,029
THEY COULD SOLVE SOME OF THIS

94
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,197
IN AN HOUR IF THE DEMOCRATS

95
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:44,797
WERE NOT OBSTRUCTING.

96
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:45,765
BUT LIKE WITH DACA, THEY REALLY

97
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:51,170
DON'T CARE ABOUT THESE PEOPLE.

98
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,005
THEY WANT TO SHOW THIS, THEY

99
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:52,839
WANT TO TRY AND BLAME IT ON

100
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,706
TRUMP AND IS NOT GOING TO WORK

101
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:54,741
THIS TIME.

102
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:55,575
STEVE: LET'S PICK UP JASON ON

103
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:56,843
THAT MEXICO POINT.

104
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,012
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

105
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,013
INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS,

106
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:03,883
ASSUMING THE CHANGED ATTITUDE

107
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:04,250
OF MEXICO.

108
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:04,984
THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD THIS

109
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,185
NEW TRADE DEAL NEGOTIATED.

110
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,120
THE ACTIONS THEY ARE TAKING DO

111
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:12,458
SEEM TO BE MORE COOPERATIVE.

112
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,293
>> WE ARE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

113
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:21,334
MAYBE OR MAYBE NOT.

114
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:22,669
UNITED STATES AMERICA LEGALLY

115
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,536
AND LAWFULLY BRINGS IN ABOUT A

116
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,704
MILLION PEOPLE YEAR.

117
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,371
MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY

118
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,239
COMBINED.

119
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,006
IN THIS SURGE IS ONE OF THE

120
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,074
WORST THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN

121
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:28,775
DEMOCRATS AND COURAGE.

122
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:29,676
IT STARTED WITH BARACK OBAMA.

123
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:30,877
WHEN HE CHANGE THE PARAMETERS

124
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:31,244
OF ASYLUM.

125
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:33,279
HE BASICALLY SAID COME HERE AND

126
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,213
WE CAN CHANGE THE WAY YOU CAN

127
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:34,714
COMMIT THIS CLAIM.

128
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:42,055
THEY YOU SEE THESE PEOPLE, AND

129
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,022
THEY ARE RAPED, THEY ARE

130
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:43,923
PILLAGED, THEIR TAKEN ADVANTAGE

131
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:44,324
OF.

132
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:45,258
IT IS HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND AT

133
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,226
THE DEMOCRATS, THEY SEEM TO

134
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,061
THINK IT'S OKAY!

135
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:48,861
THEY SHOULD BE SAYING NO.

136
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,129
IF YOU WANT TO CLAIM ASYLUM AND

137
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,030
THE RIGHT WAY WITH THE UNITED

138
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:51,731
STATES, GO TO THE LOCAL

139
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,198
EMBASSY.

140
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:59,806
IN HONDURAS OR GUATEMALA AND AS

141
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:01,107
A COUNTRY, WE SUPPORTED THEM

142
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:01,574
FOR DECADES.

143
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,608
GO TO THE NEXT COUNTRY AND STAY

144
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,042
THERE.

145
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,010
DO NOT LEAPFROG TO TRY AND GET

146
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:04,744
TO THE UNITED STATES.

147
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:05,611
>> THE DEMOCRATS HATE IT WHEN

148
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:13,019
YOU SAY YOU ARE FOR OPEN

149
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,453
BORDERS.

150
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:14,420
THEY SAY NO BUT THIS IS AN

151
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,288
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO SHOW

152
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:15,588
THAT.

153
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,223
IT IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND

154
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:17,924
I WILL SEE A SINGLE DEMOCRAT

155
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:18,558
SPEAKING UP AGAINST THIS.

156
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,461
AND ERIC GARCETTI -- THERE'S AN

157
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:22,395
ARGUMENT HE PUT OUT THERE THAT

158
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,197
I THINK IS, IT REVEALS

159
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:28,935
SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THE

160
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:29,635
DEMOCRATS SEE.

161
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:30,036
LET'S WATCH.

162
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,104
>> FUNDAMENTALLY, WHAT THE

163
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:34,273
ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T GET LIKE

164
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,041
SO MANY OF ITS PLANS, THEY KNOW

165
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,075
WHAT THEY ARE AGAINST, THEY

166
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,711
DON'T HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

167
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,012
INVESTING FOR INSTANCE AND

168
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,314
STABILIZING THE ECONOMIES OF

169
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,281
THE COUNTRIES IN CENTRAL

170
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:42,615
AMERICA.

171
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,685
IT'S A GREAT WAY TO CUT OFF --

172
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:46,786
THEY THINK A WALL WILL KEEP

173
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,754
PEOPLE OUT WHEN THEY DON'T GO

174
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:50,890
TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM.

175
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:51,724
STEVE: THAT IS EXACTLY WRONG.

176
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,025
I WANT TO POINT IT OUT.

177
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,327
EXPLAIN TO THE AUDIENCE, OF

178
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:55,261
COURSE IT IS TRUE THAT THE ROOT

179
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:56,896
PROBLEM IS THE FACT THAT YOU

180
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:57,764
HAVE THESE FAILED STATES.

181
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,466
FEELING EVEN MORE.

182
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,167
BUT THE IDEA THAT INVESTING

183
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:04,871
WHICH IS CODE FOR GIVING THEM

184
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:05,705
MORE MONEY WILL SOLVE THE

185
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:06,906
PROBLEM IS SO RIDICULOUS.

186
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:07,974
IT IS ABOUT ENCOURAGING THEM TO

187
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,008
GET RICHER IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY

188
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,810
PRETTY MEANS THE INSTITUTIONS,

189
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,779
THE MARKET ECONOMY IN A FREE

190
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,447
SOCIETY, PROPERTY RIGHTS, RULE

191
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,415
OF LAW, ALL OF THE THINGS THAT

192
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:23,089
ARE THE BASIS TO GET RICHER AND

193
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:23,689
BE STABLE.

194
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,590
NOT JUST HANDING THEM OVER

195
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:25,792
MONEY.THEN HE SAYS IS NOT

196
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:26,225
ABOUT THE WAR.

197
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:29,228
WHICH BRINGS ME TO YOU, IT JUST

198
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:37,570
CAPTURES THIS ATTITUDE THAT YOU

199
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:38,504
HAVE TOOTH, -- TO A POINT OF

200
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,372
SAYING WE ARE AGAINST THE WALL.

201
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:40,573
>> THIS AND RIPTA KEEP

202
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:41,407
ADMITTING EVERYONE THAT RUNS

203
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:42,308
ACROSS THE BORDER, I'VE HEARD A

204
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,576
LOT OF DEMOCRATS SAY THAT.

205
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:44,444
FIRST WE HAVE TO SOLVE ALL OF

206
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:46,045
THESE OTHER COUNTRIES PROBLEMS.

207
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,246
NO, THAT IS PRECISELY WHY WE

208
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,080
DON'T WANT THEM COMING HERE.

209
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:57,190
AND I MEAN, TO YOUR RELATIVES

210
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,524
ESCAPING HUNGARY, WE DON'T HAVE

211
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,258
A HOLOCAUST, WITH A HARVEST OF

212
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,326
YOUR UNIT, THERE'S NOT A POTATO

213
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:00,760
FAMINE.

214
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:01,694
IN EACH ONE OF THOSE CASES

215
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:06,933
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME

216
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:07,700
UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE.

217
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,534
IT WASN'T LIKE HOW THE IRISH

218
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,735
ALWAYS LIVED, ALWAYS STARTING

219
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:10,069
TO GET.

220
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:24,684
NO, THERE WAS A POTATO FAMINE

221
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:25,485
BECAUSE A POTATO CROP DIED.

222
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,886
YOU ARE SUBJECT TO COMMUNISM.

223
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:27,954
ADOLF HITLER ROSA.

224
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:28,688
THIS IS HOW THESE PEOPLE OF ALL

225
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:29,455
THE TIME.

226
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,122
WE'RE NOT GOING TO CORRECT

227
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:30,957
THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF CULTURE.

228
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:31,991
I MEAN YES, WE WISH THEM LUCK,

229
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:32,758
WE WANT TO HELP THEM.

230
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,759
BUT TO SAY WE HAVE TO CHANGE

231
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,894
CULTURES THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND

232
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,195
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS AND HAVE

233
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:36,963
ALWAYS BEEN HEAVILY CORRUPT,

234
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:37,396
HEAVILY POOR.

235
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:37,930
IT WILL NOT HAPPEN.

236
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:38,731
YOU MAY AS WELL SAY FIRST YOU

237
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,499
HAVE TO COLONIZE MARS.

238
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,733
THEN WE CAN BUILD THE WALL.

239
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,802
STEVE: I WOULD SAY CULTURALLY

240
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:43,436
THIS IS THE INSTITUTIONAL

241
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:43,736
THING.

242
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,972
THEY DON'T HAVE THE

243
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:46,772
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK.TO

244
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:47,173
SUPPORT --

245
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:50,543
>> YES BUT IT'S BEEN A THOUSAND

246
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,078
YEARS, AMERICA IS NOT GOING TO

247
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:52,612
SOLVE -- [LAUGHTER]

248
00:06:52,613 --> 00:07:03,022
>> I AGREE WITH THAT AND I

249
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,423
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE

250
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,157
FOR THIS DIRECT INVESTMENT

251
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:05,858
WHICH IS FUTILE.

252
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:06,759
AND IT REALLY PULLS PEOPLE OUT

253
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,360
OF POVERTY.

254
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:08,294
IN A COUNTRY LIKE THAT THERE IS

255
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,629
MORE EXTREME POVERTY CERTAINLY

256
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,429
THEN IN MEXICO AND UNITED

257
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:10,763
STATES.

258
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:11,264
IT IS FREE-TRADE.

259
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,665
ACTUALLY OPENING UP MARKETS.

260
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,633
AND NOT INVESTING IN, BUT

261
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:14,934
CAPITALIZING ON THE NATURAL

262
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,303
RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE AND IN

263
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,204
ADDITION TO THE LABOR THAT THEY

264
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:18,671
HAVE GOT.

265
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,072
PART OF THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE

266
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:20,940
HERE IS, AND THIS GOES BACK TO

267
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,676
SOME OF THE FORMER COLLEAGUES,

268
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,077
WE HAVE SO MANY DISCREPANCIES

269
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,178
IN IMMIGRATION AND IT IS SO

270
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:30,416
CONFUSING AND LEGAL IMMIGRATION

271
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,152
IS REALLY LAUGHABLE AND

272
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,021
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.

273
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:40,693
THAT HAS CREATED AN IMPACT THAT

274
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:41,894
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS LOVE.

275
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:42,828
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO WORK

276
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:43,696
TOGETHER ON IMMIGRATION.THEY

277
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:44,630
LOVE THESE PICTURES BECAUSE

278
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,033
THEY RILE UP THE COMPLETELY

279
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:47,733
TORN APART BASIS ON EACH SIDE.

280
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,068
AND IF YOU HAVE LESS CHAOS AND

281
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,069
IF YOU HAVE MORE RULE OF LAW

282
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,772
AND PEOPLE KNEW EXACTLY HOW

283
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,640
THEY COULD GET INTO THE COUNTRY

284
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,975
AND HAVE MORE INCENTIVE TO GO

285
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,744
BACK WHEN THEY WERE DONE

286
00:07:58,745 --> 00:07:59,512
WORKING, IT WOULD BE MUCH

287
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:00,880
BETTER FOR BUSINESSES AND

288
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:01,714
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO

289
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:06,018
ARE BEING TORN APART AND THAT

290
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:06,919
MEANS THAT I.C.E. AGES CAN'T GO

291
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,254
AFTER BAD PEOPLE GETTING THE

292
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,555
COUNTRY BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY

293
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:18,297
THEY ARE HAVING TO LOOK AFTER

294
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:18,898
THESE OVERRUN DETENTION

295
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:19,231
CENTERS.

296
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,566
>> I THINK THAT'S WERE TALKING

297
00:08:20,567 --> 00:00:00,000
ABOUT THE BEGINNING.
