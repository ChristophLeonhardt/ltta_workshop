we'll start this hour of breaking news to because Donald Trump and his Turkish counterpart risperidone have agreed on a joint fight against ISIL and Kurdish separatist fighters in Turkey earlier in a telephone conversation with the Turkish president Trump also promised to cease arming us back Kurdish forces in Syria when our T's correspondent Kelly mop and he's been across this verse and joins us now Kalibak give us more details then well according to the foreign minister of Turkey Donald Trump has made quite a promise a rather remarkable promise it could be said to the Turkish government he has promised to stop supplying weapons to Kurdish forces in Syria now this is what we're hearing from the Turkish Foreign Minister they're saying something mr. Trump clearly stated that he had given clear instructions not to provide the YPG with arms and that this nonsense should have ended long ago now Kurdish forces in Syria have been key allies of the United States recently when there was a struggle to retake the city of Raqqa which had become the capital of Isis activities and terrorist atrocities while that was going on it was mainly Kurdish ground forces that were in the operation then they were provided with us air support after that we even heard Donald Trump vocally praise the Kurds for their fighting on the ground against the ISIL terrorists we should be using the Kurdish we should be arming the Kurdish they've proven to be the best fighters they've really proven to be the most loyal to us and we should be working with him much more so that we're working now Turkey has been waging a war for quite a while against Kurdish forces within their own borders there's a concern in Turkey that if some kind of territory or state were to be established for Kurdish forces in Syria this would serve to serve an and further instability in Turkey and furthermore there's a concern about there being an abundance of weapons in the hands of the Kurdish forces though there's a there's a concern that some of those weapons could flow to Kurdish separatists in Turkey and that could cause further problems as well the Turkish for prime minister erawan has been quite vocal about his opposition to the United States supporting Kurds in Syria this is what he has said about that issue fight against the - terrorist organization should not be leant with another terrible organization we want to believe that our allies would choose to stand beside us and not on the side of terrorist organizations now in the past Washington has been quite enthusiastic about supporting Kurdish forces in Syria however it seems that that policy has now dramatically changed in Turkey's favor Turkey has been asking the United States to stop supporting Kurdish forces and according to this report from the Foreign Minister the United States has agreed to do that however things are been rapidly changing in the region there seems to be very many realignments in recent months so we'll all be watching closely to see how this plays out sure okay thanks Caleb that was our tease Caleb mop in there for us in New York
