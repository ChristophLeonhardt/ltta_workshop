other things that I like so Glenn Close ready to Hollywood actress actually said something halfway intelligent today it was great she was talking about this it II just idiotic new movement by the left that says that you can only play a character if you are like that character in real life so you can only parent play a transgender person if you are a transgender person you can only play a gay person if you are a gay person you can only play Superman if you can fly you can only play a space alien if in fact you descend from Thanos right you can't that's how all this is gonna work well Glenn Close who is still she can get away with this because she's a major actress has been in town for four decades she says um I thought we were actors I thought that was like our thing so here's what she had to say people who are producing and directing properties like that need to go out of their way to give people like you know if you're playing trance and get trans actors jobs but they also should have the opportunity to cast the best person I think acting is a craft you know I think I personally think on that anyone should be able to play anyone well it's gonna be very sad with her career ends because that you're not allowed to say these sorts of things in Hollywood anymore
