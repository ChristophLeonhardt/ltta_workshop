I'm ami Horowitz and we shot outside of some of New York City's college campuses to get a sense of what they thought of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings they all seem to have an opinion so we asked these constitutional scholars for some of their thoughts what do you think of Trump's US Supreme Court pic camera I don't I'm certainly I think our White House is taking us back to the medieval period okay I think it's pretty clear they don't like and it seems like he's been pretty demonized out there but what absurd ideas are they willing to believe to further vilify Cavanaugh said that he does believe that we should go to back to a black person being three-fifths of a white person what do you think about that he said that he said that oh my god okay no I don't support that these people shouldn't be in office you know they're perpetuating racist ideals that's horrific racist appalled I afford that but I can't tell you I'm surprised and that's just dance believe it or not not a single person challenged me of this absurdity so let's see how much farther week ago well I'm concerned about his stance on women's women did not have the right to vote gray in the original Constitution so you want it also wants to go back to that so we're not having the right to vote does he really that's what do you I mean that's deplorable good everybody stood up the right to vote you're really surprised by these perspective now it's like documentary The Handmaid's Tale yeah so I wonder what are their priorities for choosing a Supreme Court justice do you think that the the role of the Supreme Court today should be more a promotion of social justice as opposed to the interpretation of the Constitution yes do you think we'd be better off if we obey the Supreme Court's role was to promote social justice and not the Constitution oh yeah I think social justice Constitution having real relevance to you personally no not necessarily the Constitution is so outdated little morsel to judge for all those constitutions yeah little bit I don't I honestly some place value on the Constitution honestly
