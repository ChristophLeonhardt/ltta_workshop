I am normally the type of person to consider every day a blessing but I'm not gonna lie I was really glad when last week was over high-profile celebrities seemed to get picked off at an elevated rate first it was Kate's faith and then the same day news came that famed an acclaimed chef Anthony Bourdain had committed suicide as well and on top of that we learned that Charles Krauthammer is likely nearing the end of his fight with cancer was a depressing week but maybe I shouldn't use that term so loosely it was a disheartening week and it brings the topic of depression and suicide to the forefront of conversation Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain these two by all public accounts they have it all they have fame fortune friends family fun lives those of us on the outside knew nothing of their personal and psychological struggles but that's how it is right celebrities live these lives we put them on these pedestals not realizing that they very often struggle with the same problems as we do because after all at the end of the day at some point we all will take the final breath and death has a way of grounding the survivors and I think it's time that we take a long hard look at the things that are causing our suicide rate to spike suicide claimed the lives of 30 thousand people a year in America that's 82 people a day our national suicide rate is 25% higher than it was in 1999 and one in six adults in the u.s. takes psychiatric drugs such as antidepressants and sedatives so what gives why on earth is this happening mental health certainly has a great deal to do with it but it's also cultural factors Western culture glorifies fame and fortune social media exploits and very often distorts those things not just for celebrities we always you know all of us we put our best face forward on social media we only show the happy times and even though we know that we ourselves are doing that same thing putting our best face forward it seems like everyone else is truly actually living a better life than we are there's a cognitive dissonance between what we know to be true and what we feel and what's affecting our mental state as reported by the National on Mental Illness numerous studies have been conducted and articles written linking social networking to depression to depression and social isolation eliciting feelings of envy insecurity and poor self-esteem Kirsten powers wrote a powerful op-ed this week for USA Today and I encourage you to read the full article but she describes her own personal struggles and what she feels are the or worthy contributing factors to her depression the termination of a recent romantic relationship her mother's ongoing struggle with breast cancer and her father's sudden death from a massive heart attack she talks about being on various psychiatric medications throughout her life to cope with depression and anxiety so among the causes of depression she also cites an imperfect system for prescribing psychiatric drugs as a major problem because all of us are created so intricately different there is virtually no way to tell with 100% certainty how a certain psychiatric drug is going is going to affect the patient that's why so many psychologists and psychiatrists and therapists resort to a trial and error method the biggest and most destructive my product of this method is the severe side effects and often heightened anxiety and depression that results from the wrong drug or wrong dosage aside from social media but kind of a byproduct of it is the lack of human connection in our day-to-day lives we've moved away from picking up the phone and calling an old friend or a cousin or an aunt or uncle or brother or sister we see a status update on Facebook and we kind of subconsciously consider that a check-in we know what's going on with them from social media we just saw them post a picture from their baby shower or holiday party so we don't really need to talk right wrong humans are not programmed and we aren't meant to be lone wolves we require safe surroundings and stable and strong relationships for mental well-being don't believe me Brandon keen for Wired comm did a study on the effects of solitary confinement and lack of social stimuli and says this consistent patterns emerge centering around the aforementioned extreme anxiety anger loosens mood swings and flatness and loss of impulse control in the absence of stimuli prisoners may also become hypersensitive to any stimuli at all often they obsess uncontrollably as if their minds didn't belong to them over tiny details or personal grievances panic attacks are routine as in depression and loss of memory and cognitive function now of course this is an extreme case this was a federal prisoner in solitary confinement but you can't discount the fact that these issues may be to a lesser degree manifests themselves in all of us as a result of no human connection so I have a proposal it's a big one but I think that it's worth trying I know it's nearly impossible to ask you to get off of social media I know that's unreasonable for me to ask you to do that because of my work I can't even do that myself but maybe we should start thinking about unfriending on social media the people whose friendships and relationships we value the most that way we aren't tempted to fall into complacency and fall victim to the trap of being satisfied with simply seeing their social media updates if we aren't friends with them on Facebook or social media that forces us to reach out in a more personal and meaningful way it forces us to connect over the phone or even text but I suggest phone so starting right after this video call someone and I don't know maybe let me know in the comments who you called today's Monday so do it today and I don't know try it again on Friday start and end the week on a good note thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head for the rebel
