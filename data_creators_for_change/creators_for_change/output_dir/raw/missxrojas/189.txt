1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
so I go into book shops at least once a

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,600
week and every time I go in I can't help

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,920
but think how much things have changed

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,870
since I finished working at the bookshop

5
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,400
and in fact how much things have changed

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,110
since I was first allowed to go to book

7
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,880
shops on my own i think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was about 10</font>

8
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,740
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 so as many of you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i grew</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

9
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,030
going to the same book shop a little

10
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,650
independent children's book shop in my

11
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,600
local area then when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was 15 i did work</font>

12
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,890
experience in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that book shopping then</font>

13
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,600
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was 16 i started working in that</font>

14
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,100
book shop now the book shop is sadly

15
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,990
closed it's absolutely devastating for

16
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,789
me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been closed for over a year I</font>

17
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,800
thinking now it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> replaced by Esau</font>

18
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,150
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is one of my favorite</font>

19
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,219
skincare brands but still come on anyway

20
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:33,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">that book shop had like the most finely</font>

21
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,850

23
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see something close to the caliber of</font>

24
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,020
that sort of teen section in foils and

25
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,700
there's some branches of<font color="#E5E5E5"> donk books but</font>

26
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,620
otherwise it is entirely on parallel the

27
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,120
teen section that was where I discovered

28
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,440
looking for laughter it's where I

29
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,789

36
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,199
for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I was working there so much</font>

37
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,970
as when I went in as a customer and when
