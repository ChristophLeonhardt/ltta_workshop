HAVE I DONE HERE.

84
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:18,044
HE FELT AS IF HE WAS ON PATH.

85
00:02:18,044 --> 00:02:20,713
WHAT HE HAS TO DO IS COME BACK

87
00:02:22,816 --> 00:02:23,850
ONE VOICE.

88
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,351
IN ONE WAY, I THINK HE HAD SET

00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:35,728

99
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:41,901
IN ADDITION TO WHICH THE

100
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:43,336
SUGGESTION THERE MAY BE MORE

101
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:45,171
PAYMENTS CAME AS AN ABSOLUTE

102
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:47,173
UNSETTLING FACTOR.

>> Dana: THERE IS A SCHOOL OF

104
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:49,075
THOUGHT AMONG SOME PEOPLE THAT

105

IT'S BETTER FOR THE PRESS

106
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:53,513

00:02:53,513 --> 00:02:54,314
COMMUNICATIONS, FOR THEM NOT TO

108
00:02:54,314 --> 00:02:56,516
KNOW CERTAIN THINGS BECAUSE IT

109
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:57,717
PROTECTS THEM FROM SOMETHING.

110
00:02:57,717 --> 00:02:58,451
I'VE NEVER SUBSCRIBED TO THAT

111
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:01,521
THEORY BUT I KNOW IT EXISTS.

112
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:02,322
IT WILL TURN OUT HOWEVER IT

113
00:03:02,322 --> 00:03:02,922
TURNS OUT.

114
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:05,592
THE ONLY THING I AM FOCUSED ON

115
00:03:05,592 --> 00:03:08,795
IS SOMETHING THAT I ASKED THE

116
00:03:08,795 --> 00:03:10,129
LEGAL SCHOLAR AT BERKELEY.

117
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:11,130
VERY ACCOMPLISHED LAWYER.

118
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,099
HE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THE

119
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,667
BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND HOW

120
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:15,735
THEY HAVE TO INTERACT.

121
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:17,937
I SAID WHAT IS THE SETTLED LAW

122
00:03:17,937 --> 00:03:20,039
OF WHETHER A PRESIDENT CAN

123
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,541
IGNORE A SUBPOENA FROM THE

124
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,575
JUDICIAL BRANCH.

125
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:26,112
HE SAID IT'S THE ONE THING

126
00:03:26,112 --> 00:03:28,248
THAT'S NEVER BEEN DECIDED BY A

127
00:03:28,248 --> 00:03:30,517
SUPREME COURT.

128
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:32,619
COULD BE THE FIRST TIME IT'S

129
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:33,319
DECIDED.

130
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,120
>> Juan: THE COURT SAID YOU

131
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,122
HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE DOCUMENTS.

132
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:38,324
THE QUESTION IS ABOUT THE

133
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:39,125
TESTIMONY.

134
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,660
BY THE WAY, KIMBERLY, YOU HEAR

135
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,663
THE PRESIDENT SAY RUDY IS NEW TO

136
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:43,963
THIS.

137
00:03:43,963 --> 00:03:46,733
HE WILL GET HIS FACTS STRAIGHT.

138
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:49,402
WELL, IS RUDY ON THE PAGE OR

139
00:03:49,402 --> 00:03:49,669
NOT?

140
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:50,770

142
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,338
THAT'S ACTUALLY A VOTE OF

143
00:03:52,338 --> 00:03:53,139
CONFIDENCE.

144
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:53,740
THEY ARE VERY CLOSE.

145
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,975
HE RELIES ON HIS COUNSEL.

146
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:57,744
HE'S COME ONTO THE CASE QUICKLY.

147
00:03:57,744 --> 00:04:01,080
HE IS CATCHING UP, GETTING A

148
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,115
BEAT ON EVERYTHING.

149
00:04:02,115 --> 00:04:03,516
HE'S GOING THROUGH IT.

150
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:04,918
PROTECT THE PRESIDENT, PROTECT

151
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:06,352
THE FAMILY.

152
00:04:06,352 --> 00:04:08,121
HE'S TRYING TO BE FORTHRIGHT AND

153
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:09,122
TRANSPARENT MEANS THE QUESTIONS.

154
00:04:09,122 --> 00:04:11,357
NOT RULING ANYTHING OUT OR IN.

155
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:15,962
A SMART LAWYER DOESN'T CLOSE

156
00:04:15,962 --> 00:04:17,329
DOORS.

157
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:17,964
EVALUATE IT.

158
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:18,665
CASE-BY-CASE DETERMINATION AND

159
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:19,065
BASES HERE.

160
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:20,533
IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE

161
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:26,306
PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE TO TESTIFY

162
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:26,973
OR TAKE THE FIFTH, THERE ARE

163
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:28,241
OTHER LEGAL HURDLES AND

164
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:29,008
CHALLENGES.

165
00:04:29,008 --> 00:04:31,644
YOU'VE HAD SOME KEY RULINGS THAT

166
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:33,346
HAVE BENEFITED THE PRESIDENT

167
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:34,347
WHERE YOU'VE SEEN THE FEDERAL

168
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:36,916
JUDGES PUT A STOP TO SOME OF THE

169
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,585
NONSENSE, SAYING IT'S TOO WIDE A

170
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:39,319
SCOPE.

171
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,922
WE WANT TO SEE THE MEMOS.

172
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:44,357
CAN'T JUST ENGAGE IN A FISHING

173
00:04:44,357 --> 00:04:45,558
EXPEDITION AND TRY TO REEL IN

174
00:04:45,558 --> 00:04:46,960
THE PRESIDENT OF THE

175
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,961
UNITED STATES, HIS FAMILY

176
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:49,395
MEMBERS, AND ANYONE ELSE WHO

177
00:04:49,395 --> 00:04:50,129
MIGHT HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH OR

HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS.

179
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:53,266
I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME

180
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:54,334
LEGAL HURDLES.

181
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:55,868
NOT TO MENTION HOW MANY PEOPLE

182
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:56,603
HE MIGHT HAVE COMING FORWARD

183
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:59,238
WITH TESTIMONY BETTER GOING TO

184
00:04:59,238 --> 00:05:02,141
HAVE NO CREDIBILITY WHATSOEVER

185
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:03,309
IN TERMS OF THE MUELLER

186
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:03,743
INVESTIGATION.

187
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:04,911
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE

188
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:05,578
IMPORTANT.

189
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:09,115
WHO IS GOING TO BE LEFT TO

190
00:05:09,115 --> 00:05:10,149
TESTIFY WHO HASN'T MADE

191
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:11,184
INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS OR

192
00:05:11,184 --> 00:05:13,219
RESIGN FROM THE FBI OR WRITTEN A

193
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:13,720
BOOK?

194
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,288
>> Juan: TWO PEOPLE LEFT OUT

195
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:16,522
OF THIS.

196
00:05:16,522 --> 00:05:17,924
ONE, APPARENTLY JARED IS

197
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:18,591
DISPOSABLE.

198
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:19,759
IVANKA IS OFF LIMITS.

199
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,162
DON'T GO AFTER IVANKA.

200
00:05:23,162 --> 00:05:24,263
MICHAEL COLLINS HAS YESTERDAY,

201
00:05:24,263 --> 00:05:25,431
MICHAEL COHEN MAY BE COOPERATING

202
00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:28,534
WITH MUELLER.

203
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:31,404
>> Greg: I WATCHED A LOT OF

204
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:32,105
THE COVERAGE WHEN I'M AT THE

205
00:05:32,105 --> 00:05:35,375
GYM, NOT BY CHOICE.

206
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,343
THE REASON WHY I HATE IT SO MUCH

207
00:05:37,343 --> 00:05:39,445
AND MOST OF AMERICA HATES IT,

208
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:41,914
IT'S LAWYERS INTERVIEWING

209
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:43,116
LAWYERS ABOUT WHAT A LAWYER

210
00:05:43,116 --> 00:05:44,317
SAID.

211
00:05:44,317 --> 00:05:46,152
WHAT ARE THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS

212
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:46,919
OF WHAT THEY SAID?

213
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:47,754
WE ARE NOT SURE.

214
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:49,789
LET'S GET A PANEL AND TALK ABOUT

215
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:52,625
IT.

216
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,128
THIS STORY IS SELF FUELED

217
00:05:55,128 --> 00:05:57,930
HYSTERIA GENERATED BY THOSE IN

218
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,032
THE MEDIA WHO FEED OFF IT INSIDE

219
00:05:59,032 --> 00:06:01,134
THEIR BUBBLE AND THEY DON'T CARE

220
00:06:01,134 --> 00:06:02,535
THAT OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE AMERICA

221
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:06,506
REALLY DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN.

222
00:06:06,506 --> 00:06:08,641
WE DON'T CARE.

223
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:11,711
THEY WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, TV

224
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,546
EXECUTIVE SAYING SHOULD WE DO

225
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:14,547
STORMY OR MUELLER?

226
00:06:14,547 --> 00:06:15,415
SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT

227
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:15,948
STORMING.

228
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:17,417
LET'S GET A PANEL AND TO TALK

229
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:18,351
ABOUT IT.

230
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:20,553
LET'S GET THE LEGAL PANEL TO

231
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:21,754
PARSE THE WORDS.

232
00:06:21,754 --> 00:06:24,557
THEN WE GET THE NEXT PANEL FOR

233
00:06:24,557 --> 00:06:25,558
THE POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS.

234
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:27,226
WHILE THIS IS ALL GOING ON,

235
00:06:27,226 --> 00:06:29,262
SOMEONE ELSE WILL START THE

236
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:30,797
PROCESS OVER AGAIN BY SAYING

237
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:32,265
SOMETHING ABOUT MUELLER SO THAT

238
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:34,367
YOU CAN SWITCH FROM STORMY TO

239
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:35,601
MUELLER.

240
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:36,736
MEANWHILE TRUMP'S NUMBERS

241
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:37,737
CONTINUE TO GO UP.

242
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:38,738
AMERICA GETS INCREDIBLY FED UP

243
00:06:38,738 --> 00:06:40,406
AND BURNED OUT BY THIS AND I'M

244
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:41,841
TELLING YOU THERE'S GOING TO BE

245
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:43,476
A REBOUND TO THIS THAT'S GOING

246
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:45,978
TO HELP TRUMP BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

247
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:47,814
TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT LAWYERS

248
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:49,449
AND EXPERTS TALK ABOUT SUBPOENAS

249
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:52,251
AND SUMMARIZING FACTS THAT WE

250
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:57,457
DON'T GIVE A FLYING CRAP ABOUT.

251
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:58,524
>> Brian: THOSE JUDGES WHO

252
00:06:58,524 --> 00:06:59,926
MADE THOSE COMMENTS, THEY CAME

253
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:01,728
ON SAID YOU DON'T WANT PAUL

254
00:07:01,728 --> 00:07:02,095
MANAFORT.

255
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:02,662
YOU WANT TRUMP.

256
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:04,530
THE OTHER ONE SAYS YOU HAD AN

257
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:04,931
INDICTMENT.

258
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:06,599
ONE YOU PRODUCE THE EVIDENCE FOR

259
00:07:06,599 --> 00:00:00,000
THE INDICTMENT?
