1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:02,029
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE
NEWS FOR YOU.

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:06,108
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE GOT
HIM.

3
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:10,410
DOWN GOES TRUMPCARE.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,230
SO WHETHER THIS BILL IS REVIVED,
WE WILL SEE BUT THE REPUBLICANS

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,770
HEALTHCARE BILL APPEARED TO HAVE
BIT THE DUST TODAY.

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,470
LET ME EXPLAIN HOW IT WENT DOWN
FOR YOU GUYS.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,300
YOU KNOW THE HOUSE PASSED THEIR
VERSION OF REPEALING OBAMACARE

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,300
AND REPLACE IT WITH A BILL
THAT WOULD LEAVE 23

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,488
MILLION PEOPLE UNINSURED.

10
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:33,489
THE HOUSE VERSION WOULD'VE

11
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:36,789
TAKEN AWAY YOUR PROTECTIONS ON
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS.

12
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:41,809
IT WOULD'VE MADE PREMIUIMS FOR
SENIORS MORE EXPENSIVE.

13
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,949
IT WOULD'VE COVERED LESS OF YOUR
HEALTHCARE.

14
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:49,870
IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER, AND
IT'S RATINGS ARE HORRIBLE.

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,429
THE SENATE HAD A SIMILAR BILL.

16
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:54,250
IT THREW 22 MILLION PEOPLE OFF
OF

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,122
HEALTHCARE AND IT ALSO GOT RID
OF OBAMACARE AND REPLACED

18
00:00:58,122 --> 00:00:59,122
IT WITH SOMETHING AWFUL.

19
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:18,250
FROM THE BEGINNING OF IT 
ALMOST

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,250
THEY NEEDED

21
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,180
TO HOLD ALL BUT TWO REPUBLICAN
SENATORS.

22
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,780
THEY ONLY HAVE 52.

23
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,150
THEIR PLAN WAS TO GET TO
50, DO SOME OF THIS, AND SOME OF

24
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,150
THIS.

25
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,289
THEY CAN'T EVEN DO
THAT BECAUSE IT WOULD REQUIRE 60

26
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,289
VOTES AND

27
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:31,780
THEN GET MIKE PENCE TO BREAK THE
TIE.

28
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,530
THEY LOST SUSAN COLLINS IN

29
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,689
THE BEGINNING BECAUSE SHE
THOUGHT IT WAS TOO DRACONIAN.

30
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:39,240
AND ROSS RAND PAUL BECAUSE HE
THOUGHT IT WAS NOT DRACONIAN

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,240
ENOUGH.

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,200
HE WANTS
LIBERTARIAN ISLAND WHERE

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,369
EVERYONE EATS EACH OTHER.

34
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,760
HE WAS NEVER GOING TO GO YES, IT
WAS NEVER GOING TO BE HARSH

35
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,060
FOR HIM.

36
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,320
NEEDED EVERYONE ELSE TO HOLD AND
LAST NIGHT MIKE LEE AND JERRY

37
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,130
MORAN, BOTH CONSERVATIVE CAME OUT
AND SAID WE'RE WITH RAND

38
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,280
PAUL, THIS DOESN'T TAKE ENOUGH
PEOPLE OFF OF HEALTHCARE.

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,590
USE THOSE EXACT WORDS BUT
BASICALLY THEY SAID WE NEED MORE

40
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,031
FREEDOM, MORE TAX CUTS FOR THE
RICH AND THIS DOESN'T DO

41
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:12,390
DEVASTATE MEDICAID ENOUGH.

42
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,970
UNBELIEVABLE, BUT GUESS, THEY
ARE NO VOTES THINK GOD.

43
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,360
NOW THEY COULD NOT PASS THE
SENATE VERSION THAT WE'VE

44
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,470
BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR WEEKS.

45
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,330
THEN MITCH MCCONNELL CAME OUT
AND SAID THESE THINGS AND

46
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,580
THAT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT
THEIR NEW PLANETS AND WHY

47
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,010
THAT APPEARS TO HAVE ALSO
IMMEDIATELY BUT THE DUST.

48
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,280
AND I WILL SAY THE VOTES BEHIND
IT.

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,530
MCCONNELL SAID TODAY
REGRETFULLY, IT IS NOW

50
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,170
APPARENT THAT THE EFFORT TO
REPEAL AND IMMEDIATELY

51
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:43,690
REPLACE THE FAILURE OF OBAMA
CARE WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

52
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:49,200
OKAY, WE ADDED THE FIREWORKS.

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,370
HUFFINGTON POST REPORTS FOR
THEIR THAT HE CONTINUE TO

54
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,310
CITIZEN IT WOULD TAKE UP AN
EARLIER HOSPITAL AND VOTE

55
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,060
FOR A REPEAL OF OBAMACARE WITH
A TWO-YEAR DELAY TO PROVIDE

56
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,650
A STABLE TRANSITION PERIOD TO A
PATIENT CENTERED HEALTH

57
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,340
CARE SYSTEM.

58
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,740
OKAY.

59
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,380
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

60
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,430
THAT MEANS, I DON'T KNOW, WE GET
RID OF OBAMACARE BECAUSE

61
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,180
WE TOLD OUR VOTERS WE WOULD DO
THAT AND THEN WE PUNT.

62
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,060
WHAT ARE WE REPLACING IT WITH?

63
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,060
I DON'T KNOW.

64
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,330
THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD
LOSE HEALTH INSURANCE UNDER THAT

65
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:26,270
IS SO GIGANTIC THAT ONE ESTIMATE
PUT IT AT 75% OF THE COUNTRY.

66
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:33,610
THE BACKUP PLAN WAS WE JUST GET
RID OF INSURANCE.

67
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,610
PREPOSTEROUS.

68
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,810
AGAIN, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED WITH HER

69
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,080
ALREADY TODAY THAT WILL VARIOUS
MEDIA OUTLETS NOTED THAT IT

70
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,320
WAS HIGHLY UNLIKELY FULL REPEAL
OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

71
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,930
WOULD PASS, MCCONNELL'S MOVE
LIGHTLY AMOUNTED TO A

72
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,782
CHALLENGE TO COLLEAGUES WHO HAD
SEALED REPEAL AND REPLACE

73
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:52,290
PROGRAM NOT CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH
DOTS THAT ITALY TOLD YOU.

74
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,060
BUT AS MICHAEL LEE, RAND PAUL,
ALL OF THOSE GUESSING NO, I

75
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,990
WANT TO KICK MORE PEOPLE OFF OF
MEDICAID AND THEIR HEALTH

76
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,280
INSURANCE AND IF IT'LL HAVE
INSURANCE, WE HAVE

77
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,220
SOMETHING ELSE FOR THEM.

78
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,220
BOOTSTRAPS.

79
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,870
MCCONNELL CALLED THEIR BLUFF AND
SAID OKAY, YOU WANT TO JUST

80
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,210
REPEAL AND HAVE NO BACKUP PLAN
AND MAYBE HOPEFULLY TWO YEARS

81
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:14,820
LATER WE SOMEHOW, HE WOULD NEED
60 VOTES FOR THAT DOES SOMEHOW

82
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,660
WE GET A DEMOCRATS TO AGREE WITH
US TO DESTROY OBAMACARE AND

83
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,140
REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING THAT
COVERS LESS PEOPLE.

84
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,660
THAT IS YOUR PLAN CLUSTER AS
SOON AS HE ANNOUNCED THAT

85
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,590
MIKE LEE SAID YEAH, I LIKE THAT
PLAN.

86
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,810
HE THEN SAID ALL RIGHT, NOW I
WILL FOR IT.

87
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,380
BUT THEN THEY IMMEDIATELY LOST
OVER OTHER VOTES BECAUSE

88
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,750
SHERRY MAYOR SHERRY MOORE CAPITO
IN WEST VIRGINIA IS LIKE

89
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,340
LISTEN, YOU ARE NOT GETTING IT.

90
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,660
3RD OF WEST VIRGINIA IS ON
MEDICAID.

91
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:50,510
I CANNOT REPEAL IT AND THEN GO I
DON'T KNOW, A THIRD OF THE

92
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,210
STATE HAS NO INSURANCE.

93
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,900
THAT IS BECAUSE MEDICAID OF
COURSE GOT INCREASED UNDER

94
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,300
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
AND THAT IS LIKE OVER 70

95
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,110
PEOPLE IN WEST VIRGINIA AND EVEN
THOUGH THEY VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY

96
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,700
FOR TRUMP, THEY ACTUALLY KIND OF
LOVE OBAMACARE.

97
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,650
IF YOU THINK THAT AWAY FROM
THEM, THEY WOULD BE LIKE WHEN

98
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,670
A MEDICAL STUDENT WE JUST VOTE
AGAINST HER OWN SELF INTEREST?

99
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,070
THE GIG WOULD BE UP.

100
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,920
THEN CAPITO AS A REPUBLICAN CAN
PRETEND TO BE ON THE SIDE

101
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,530
THAT THEY WOULD BE LIKE WHEN A
MINUTE, YOU TOOK MY HEALTH

102
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,540
INSURANCE AWAY.

103
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,540
I'M SICK.

104
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,540
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

105
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,880
THAT WAS OUR PLAN ALL ALONG.

106
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,500
SHE'S LIKE THAT IS TOO OBVIOUS.

107
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
I CAN'T DO THAT.

108
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,860
ROB PORTMAN COMES DOWN FROM
OHIO AND SAYS I HAVE TO

109
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,500
RECONSIDER THIS.

110
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,050
SUSAN COLLINS IS LIKE NO, THIS
IS EVEN DUMBER.

111
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,600
I'M NOT VOTING FOR THIS.

112
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,139
SHE IS OUT AND THEN THE CAMEL
THAT BREAKS THE BACK, LISA MURKOWSKI FROM

113
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,639
ALASKA COMES OUT AND IS LIKE NO,
WE'RE NOT GOING TO REPEAL IT

114
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,139
WITH NO PLAN TO REPLACE IT.

115
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,960
THAT IS A BIGGER DISASTER.

116
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,850
SO IT IS GONE AND ALL THE SUDDEN
THEY HAVE NO PLAN.

117
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,360
WHEN WE GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS.

118
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,111
RESPONDING TO THE NEWS OF THE
SENATE BILL DEMISE, TRUMP

119
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:01,940
ON MONDAY CALLED ON REPUBLICANS
TO VOTE FOR AN OUTRIGHT

120
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,010
REPEAL OBAMACARE, URGING
LAWMAKERS TO START FROM A

121
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,010
CLEAN SLATE ONE NOTING THAT HE
BELIEVED DEMOCRATS WOULD JOIN

122
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,800
ANTI- LET ME REDO THAT EXACTLY
BECAUSE AS DONALD TRUMP'S PLAN.

123
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,410
BY THE WAY, I CAN EXPLAIN TO
YOU, THIS PLAN IS ALREADY DEAD.

124
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:19,610
HE IS NOT FOLLOWING THE NEWS.

125
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,139
HE TWEETED EARLY IN THE DAY TO
BE FAIR.

126
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,840
REPUBLICAN SHOULD JUST REPEAL
FAILING OBAMACARE NOW AND WORK

127
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,419
ON A NEW HEALTHCARE PLAN THAT
WILL START FROM A CLEAN SLATE.

128
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:29,471
DEMS WILL JOIN IN.

129
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:34,870
SURE DEMOCRATS WILL JOIN IN TO
HELP YOU DESTROY OBAMACARE

130
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,780
AND MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR
THE WALL.

131
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,510
WE ARE WAITING FOR, ANY SECOND
NOW THAT HE WENT ON TO

132
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,000
COMPOUND THAT.

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,370
I'VE ALWAYS
SAID, LET OBAMACARE FAIL

134
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,840
AND THEN COME TOGETHER INTO A
GREAT HEALTH CARE PLAN.

135
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,100
STAY TUNED.

136
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,610
OKAY, NO.

137
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,660
WE'RE NOT GOING TO STAY TUNED
AND LOOK AT HOW VICIOUS

138
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,660
THAT IS IT.

139
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,081
I'M GOING TO GET TO HIS STRATEGY
HERE IN A SECOND BECAUSE

140
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:59,949
I'M GOING TO PLAY A CLIP FROM
DONALD TRUMP OF THE REASON

141
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,880
THAT IT FAILED IS THIS.

142
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,560
THIS IS FROM ABC NEWS WASHINGTON
POST POLL I TOLD YOU ABOUT

143
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,890
JUST YESTERDAY.

144
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,080
ON HIS PARTY SIGNATURE
CAMPAIGN ISSUE, HEALTHCARE,

145
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,730
AMERICANS BUY A 2 TO 1 MARGIN
PREFER OBAMACARE OVER THE

146
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,740
REPUBLICAN PLAN TO REPLACE IT,
50 TO 24%.

147
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,240
YOU KNOW THAT MEANS?

148
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,070
THAT MEANS ALL OF YOUR LIES
ABOUT HOW OBAMACARE IS

149
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,260
FAILING, IT IS MISERABLE, IT IS
TERRIBLE.

150
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,199
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HATE IT IS
NOT TRUE.

151
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,449
50% IS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD
OVERALL AND BETTER THAN

152
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:35,150
OBAMACARE HAD BEEN DOING BEFORE
PEOPLE SAW THE ALTERNATIVE.

153
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,040
THERE LIKE WOW, THE ALTERNATIVE
IS HIDEOUS.

154
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,930
NO, 50 TO 24.

155
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:40,930
DENTISTRY CANCER.

156
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,930
BEHAVIOR PLAN.

157
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:47,260
THEY HATE IT BIGLY.

158
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,740
TRUMP IS GOING TO SAY WHO CARES.

159
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,710
LET IT FAILED.

160
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,310
THE BEST CASE SCENARIO FOR TRUMP
HERE IS PEOPLE START DYING.

161
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,810
IF HE WAS RIGHT, HE IS NOT, BUT
IF USC'S LIKE WHAT THEM

162
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,090
DYNASTIES AND THEN MAYBE THE
DEMOCRATS WANT TO DO SOMETHING

163
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,760
ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING
TO DO WHAT THEY WANT THAT WE'RE

164
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,020
NOT GOING TO HELP THEM OR
AMERICANS WHICH IS WHAT ARE

165
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,620
PLAN PASSED BECAUSE AS TAX CUTS
OF THE REST OUT WITH THEM

166
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,530
PLAN WITH THE BELT IDEAS TRUMP.

167
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,930
WE'RE DISAPPOINTED, I AM VERY
DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE AGAIN, EVEN

168
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,240
AS A CIVILIAN FOR SEVEN YEARS
I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT

169
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,130
HEALTHCARE AND I'VE BEEN HEARING
ABOUT REPEAL AND REPLACE AN

170
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,740
OBAMACARE IS A TOTAL DISASTER
AND I THINK YOU ALSO AGREE THAT

171
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,958
I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG
TIME, LET OBAMACARE FAIL AND

172
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,468
THEN EVERYBODY IS GOING TO HAVE
TO COME TOGETHER AND FIX IT AND

173
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:41,879
COME UP WITH A NEW PLAN AND A
PLAN THAT IS REALLY GOOD FOR THE

174
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:47,300
PEOPLE WITH MUCH LOWER PREMIUMS,
COST AND MUCH BETTER PROTECTION.

175
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,800
I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT, MY, I
THINK YOU'LL AGREE FOR A

176
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
LONG TIME.

177
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,850
LET OBAMACARE FAILED I WILL BE
A LOT EASIER AND I THINK WERE

178
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,260
PROBABLY IN A POSITION WHERE
WILL JUST LET OBAMACARE FAIL.

179
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,430
WE ARE NOT GOING TO OWN IT.

180
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,871
I'M NOT GOING TO OWN AND I CAN
SAY THE REPUBLICAN IS GOING

181
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:01,871
TO OWN IT.

182
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:04,899
WE WILL LET OBAMACARE FAIL
AND THEN THE DEMOCRATS ARE

183
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:08,420
GOING TO COME TO US AND SAY HOW
DO WE FIX THE?

184
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,779
OR HAD WE COME UP WITH A NEW
PLAN.

185
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:13,100
IF YOU ARE FOLLOWING THIS
ISSUE YOU ARE WONDERING, IS HE

186
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,109
A MONSTER IS A STUPID QUESTION
OF THE CORRECT ANSWER IS BOTH.

187
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:20,410
WHEN HE SAYS I'M GOING TO LET
OBAMACARE FAIL, THEN HE

188
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,480
WAS A YEAH, THEN YOU GUYS WILL
NOT HAVE INSURANCE TYPE IS

189
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,350
RIGHT, HE IS NOT, OBAMACARE IS
NOT FAILING, WHAT IS I MEAN?

190
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,019
IF YOU SAY PREMIUMS ARE TOO
HIGH.

191
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,970
THAT IS A FAIR AND INTERESTING
ARGUMENT, PROGRESSIVES

192
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,149
ARGUED AGAINST ADHERE WASTE
CAN FIX THAT THAT YOU CAN

193
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:37,779
NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES FOR
MEDICARE WHICH IS WHAT YOU

194
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:39,769
SAID YOU WOULD DO DURING THE
CAMPAIGN THAT WE CAN

195
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:41,720
PROTECT MEDICARE AND PET
MEDICAID WHICH IS WHAT YOU

196
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,529
SAID YOU DO ON THE CAMPAIGN THAT
THOSE ARE THINGS DEMOCRATS

197
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:49,190
WOULD IMMEDIATELY AGREE TO BUT
YOU ARE NOT DOING ANY OF THAT.

198
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,610
WHEN HE SAYS OBAMACARE IS
FAILING, THE AMERICAN

199
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,279
PEOPLE DON'T AGREE BECAUSE IT IS
FAIRLY POPULAR.

200
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,279
IT IS WAY

201
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,510
MORE POPULAR THAN THE REPUBLICAN
PLAN.

202
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,670
2ND OF ALL, IF IT WAS FAILING,
THEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE

203
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,910
INSURANCE, THEY CAN AFFORD AND
THEIR DYING DAY IS LIKE IT,

204
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,529
LET THEM DIE, LET IT FAIL.

205
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:10,269
THAT IS MONSTROUS.

206
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:16,240
NOW WAIT A MINUTE, WHEN AND IF
HE WAS RIGHT AND IF IT LATER AND

207
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,279
PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE HEALTH
INSURANCE AND THEY STARTED

208
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:21,980
DYING, THEN THEY WOULD JUST GO
BACK TO THIS CLIP AND THEY WOULD

209
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,050
SAY YOU LIKED THE IDEA OF US NOT
HAVING INSURANCE.

210
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,889
YOU ARE THE ONE WHO SAID LET
OBAMACARE FAIL.

211
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:31,370
YOU ARE THE ONE WHO CAN PASS THE
LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE IT

212
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,600
OR PASS IT, IT'S AGAIN NEW
LEGISLATION THAT YOU

213
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,139
THOUGHT WOULD BE BETTER AND YOU
CAVALIERLY TOLD US TO GO

214
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,160
DIE.

215
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,850
HOW STUPID ARE YOU?

216
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,310
YOU JUST SAID THAT ABOUT 12
TIMES ON TAPE.

217
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,029
AND THE REALITY IS, HE DOESN'T
CARE ABOUT YOU.

218
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:50,939
HE HAS NEVER CARED ABOUT YOU.

219
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:52,160
IT WAS ALL ABOUT ME ME

220
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
ME ME ME.

221
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,689
I'M DONALD TRUMP, I'M GOING TO
BE RICH AND SUCCESSFUL.

222
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,879
I'M GOING TO HAVE POWER.

223
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,350
SO IF OBAMACARE IS FAILING
AND HENCE, YOU DON'T HAVE

224
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,459
INSURANCE AND YOUR FAMILY
SUFFERS, GREAT.

225
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:05,459
AND I

226
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,019
AM SO STUPID, I JUST SAID GREAT
ON TAPE.

227
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:10,600
8 TIMES OVER.

228
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,619
THEY DON'T HAVE A NEW PLAN.

229
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:15,699
THEIR PLAN WAS ALWAYS
DESTRUCTION.

230
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:18,119
THEY DON'T HAVE A CONSTRUCTION
PLANT THAT THE PLAN

231
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:21,280
WOULD'VE TAKEN MORE PEOPLE OFF
OF HEALTHCARE AND THE

232
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,750
AMERICAN PEOPLE JUST SAID GO
PACE OFF.

233
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,800
24% APPROVAL RATING FOR A PLAN
IS AS MISERABLE AS YOU

234
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,529
COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE AND WHAT
HAPPENED, DONALD TRUMP?

235
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:35,009
I THOUGHT YOU HAD THE ART OF THE
DEAL.

236
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:37,310
YOU ARE A DEALMAKER.

237
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,310
WHERE IS YOUR DEAL?

238
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,829
I TOLD YOU GUYS DURING THE
CAMPAIGN, THE NUMBER ONE

239
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:45,149
PROBLEM WITH DONALD TRUMP IS
ACTUALLY HIS INCOMPETENCE.

240
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:48,220
TOTALLY AND UTTERLY INCOMPETENT
THAT YESTERDAY AS THE BILL

241
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,199
IS FAILING, HE HAS NO IDEA
THAT HE DID THAT WITH THE

242
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:53,680
REPUBLICANS AND HE IS LIKE ALL
RIGHT, EVERYTHING IS GOING

243
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,149
GOOD, RECKLESS AND IT WILL
PASSES, WE'RE GOING TO BE DOPES.

244
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:01,329
HEY KNUCKLEHEAD, PAUL MICHAEL HE
ASIDE.

245
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:04,399
PULL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
OBJECTING ASIDE AND TRY TO

246
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,399
MAKE A DEAL.

247
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,290
HE DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT
BECAUSE HE IS SO STUPID.

248
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,290
HE

249
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,290
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

250
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,889
THE LESSON YOU MEANT WHEN THE
REPUBLICANS, THEY SAID

251
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:15,670
REMEMBER ALL THE TAX CUTS FOR
THE RICH WE HAVE IN THEIR

252
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,040
IDEAS LIKE WHAT TAX CUTS?

253
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
THAT'S A DIFFERENT BILL.

254
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,050
HE'S LIKE NO, THERE'S TAX CUTS
IN THIS BUILD ON HE'S LIKE

255
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,050
REALLY?

256
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,790
I THINK YOU GOT THAT WRONG.

257
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,629
HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

258
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:30,739
THAT IS WHY HE WENT BANKRUPT SIX
TIMES AND HE IS BASICALLY

259
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:32,850
DOING THAT TO THE COUNTRY NOW.

260
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,949
DESTROYING EVERYTHING HE
TOUCHES, BUT WE ARE TO

261
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:37,000
LEAVE HIM TO FUND NOTES.

262
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,420
1ST OF ALL WHICH IS KNOW FOR THE
RECORD ONE MORE TIME.

263
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,199
THEY FAILED.

264
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:47,079
OBAMACARE LIVES.

265
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:51,619
NOW?

266
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:54,389
THEY WILL COME BACK, THEY ARE
ZOMBIES, I KNOW THEY WILL

267
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:55,760
COME BACK.

268
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,800
THEIR $700 BILLION OF TAX CUTS
AND THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE

269
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,019
SO THEY WOULD DO TAX REFORM IN
AND THEY WILL TRY TO COME

270
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:06,600
BACK TO THIS BUT A SECOND WINDOW
TO LEAVE YOU ON IS MIKE PENCE.

271
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,620
AFTER THIS BUMBLING FULL GETS
HIMSELF THROWN OUT OF

272
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,160
OFFICE, THIS GUY IS GOING TO BE
PRESIDENT I UNDERSTAND YOU

273
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,430
MIKE PENCE IS.

274
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,779
JR DID A GREAT VIDEO HERE OF
MIKE PENCE'S REACTION IN

275
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,980
THAT LAST VIDEO YOU WATCH THEM
TRUMP.

276
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,040
LOOK AT THIS SAD, SAD YES-MAN.

277
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,899
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I
FULLY SUPPORT THE MAJORITY

278
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:25,899
LEADER'S DECISION.

279
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:26,899
NOT THAT ONE, THE OTHER ONE.

280
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:27,899
OKAY, YEAH, RIGHT.

281
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:28,899
ANOTHER NOT.

282
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:29,899
OKAY YEAH.

283
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:30,980
YOU ARE SO RIGHT, DONALD TRUMP.

284
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,589
DON'T EVER FORGET THIS VIDEO.

285
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:35,059
YEAH, I AM BEHIND YOU DONALD.

286
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:39,110
EVERYTHING YOU SAY DONALD
THOUGHT THAT IS A GOOD ONE.

287
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,110
INTENTLY.

288
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,170
YOU KNOW THEY CALL ME IN
INDIANA?

289
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,519
MIKE.

290
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,879
OEF.

291
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:52,449
ANOTHER NOD AND ANOTHER NOD.

292
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:54,149
THAT IS MY DEAR LEADER.

293
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:55,149
OKAY.

294
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:57,300
THAT IS WHO MIKE PENCE IS.

295
00:13:57,300 --> 00:00:00,000
I LOOK FORWARD TO WRESTLING WITH
HIM LATER.
