work looking more confident and sharp

104
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,140
because it's the two threads of hope and

105
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,730
faith preciously<font color="#CCCCCC"> webbing around your</font>

106

excuse us while we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a step forward</font>

blocking out the persecution and

116
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,860
although I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are no need of</font>

117
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,260
any Hills to elevate you and that we may

118

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,220
types of shoes others will still have to

120
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">put a feat in each one to understand the</font>

path we've walked through thank you
