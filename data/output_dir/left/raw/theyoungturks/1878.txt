195
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:22,830
covering Bernie Sanders at all and

196
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,539
usually what they say is oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> no we didn't</font>

203
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,540
Sanders I had another on-air talent at

MSNBC telling me off the record<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

205
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,589
they ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> criticized Hillary Clinton</font>

they would immediately get a call<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

management<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know if you remember</font>

00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">but mika brzezinski</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on air said that if</font>

212
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:05,950
then MSNBC would talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their hosts so</font>

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,200
if that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in the tank for Hillary</font>

Clinton<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know what is</font>

00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,950
the mainstream<font color="#E5E5E5"> media the fix was in with</font>

232
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,740
managing the news and shutting down

233
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,230
Bernie Sanders and it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> until he</font>

234
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,910
started matching the Clintons and

235
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,100
raising money that he became well we

236
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">gotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cover this guy but from the start</font>

237
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,930
the Clintons didn't want any<font color="#CCCCCC"> competition</font>

238
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">they didn't want Bernie Sanders around</font>

239
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,790
they didn't want the Keystone XL XL

240
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,380
pipeline they didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push her on</font>

241
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that issue they didn't want to push her</font>

242

on free education for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

243
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,880
certainly didn't want to push her on

244
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">only on the TPP and also universal</font>

00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">health care those were four main issues</font>

246
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Bernie Sanders had he not been to</font>

fix was<font color="#CCCCCC"> in early on to deep-six Bernie</font>

254
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,050
look I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the Russians did interfere</font>

255
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the election I've said that about a</font>
