President Trump is in the Swiss resort of Davos for the World Economic Forum he's already spoken to British Prime Minister Theresa May and we can now cross live to our T's Jacqueline booga who's there right now he's been following the meeting so Jacqueline has anything come out of that meeting well directly after both talked about how productive the conversation was how happy and honored they were to meet one another Trump went on to emphasize the fact that they do have a great relationship contrary to what some people might think he repeated that a couple times that they have a great wonderful productive relationship that he respects Teresa made very much and that they're joined at the hip when it comes to military and if the UK were ever in trouble that the US would be there to back them up Teresa may for her part did say once again that the US and the UK have a special relationship and that they will be working together in the future and that she too was honored and happy to meet with Trump and have the great conversation that had taken place between the two of them now this comes out right on the heels of just a few weeks ago when Trump cancelled his visit to the UK to open the new u.s. embassy there and he said that was due to what he considered to be a bad deal when it came to the price of her selling the old embassy there in London but not sure if that's actually the case but both are still saying there is that special relationship between the two countries and this is all coming on the heels of you know Trump coming arriving in Davos today and everyone believes that he'll once again be putting forward his America first mantra that's what the White House has said and that may not be to the tastes of everyone that's here at the World Economic Forum which has more of a globalist atmosphere and trends Trump's transportation secretary yesterday didn't mince her words when she said that if people don't want to listen to that message they have options so let's take a listen America first is a continuation of the American the affirmation of American exceptionalism I don't think well I think this you know all these questions are why the president is coming and again I think novels should feel very flattered that he has chosen this as a forum myself of those that don't want to listen to him you can they can leave you know this is part of what discourse and discussion is all about so we'll have to wait and see if anyone takes her up on that suggestion and does leave during his speech tomorrow now meanwhile we've heard already from Makran and Merkel and they both had sort of Europe first message that they were putting out which maybe isn't as nationalist as America first but it's not globalist either which is a bit strange in the setting of this forum let's take a listen ladies and gentlemen my first message he said France is back France is back at the core of Europe because we will never have any French success without a European success if between our 27 member states were not able to send a clear and united message to major powers such as China India and the United States if foreign policy is made on the national level then we will fail and today during Teresa Mays speech at the conference she also had similar sentiments talking about how the UK would be one of the best places to open a a company or to work on AI a lot of we would be the best country to open new businesses to start new things and the safest country to be on the internet so a lot of that sort of idea of European leaders looking at their own countries in Europe as a whole as a leading force but of course we still have the rest of today and one more day tomorrow of Davos and we'll see what else comes out of it yeah we're gonna have to definitely wait and see what comes out of it and let's hope that the great relationship continues Jacqueline Lucca they're reporting from Davos thanks Jackie we discussed the upcoming talks with economist Keith boy field I expect from mr. Trump's visit to Davos an awful lot of security and police and army also you've got to bear in mind that mr. Trump has a stable genius as he puts it and he likes to be stride the world stage and so I think because mr. the president of China was the great favorite star at Davos last year I think mr. Trump wants to be the star this year I think that there will be a lot of politicians wanting to speak to the gallery mr. Trump will be wanting to play to his political base over in the state so he wants will want to be seen to be talking tough and in the similar fashion mr. macro mrs. Merkel who's still trying to form a government in Germany will also be wanting to be seen to be supporting their national self-interest so I suspect we're going to be seeing quite a few fireworks
