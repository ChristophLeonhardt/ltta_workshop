my name is Gareth Owlman I'm a research fellow at the University of Cambridge and my claim to fame is that I was one of the first academically trained economists to take an interest in Bitcoin and blockchain technology so so Bitcoin you know became number one I think in large part because it was first and for a long time it was really he only crypto currency game in town and so many developers who were interested in cryptocurrency you know kind of cut their teeth working on Bitcoin and and remain quiet loyal to it but a number of people have left the Bitcoin community to start other cryptocurrencies because they wanted to go in a different direction and I think the the case of etherium is particularly important here it really shows that you can build something quite significant away from Bitcoin doing very different you know very different things very different approaches to the technology so you know very talented people we're coming into the space now may have more of an incentive to try to build their own cryptocurrency or new blockchain based system rather than to build on something that's already in place because you know we've seen now that you can create something new and you can accrue you know tremendous value if you are kind of at the on the ground floor of that
