>> Harris: THERE IS GROWING
SPECULATION THAT FORMER FBI
DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY COULD
FIND HIMSELF IN HOT WATER
LEGALLY FOLLOWING THE
RELEASE OF DOJ INSPECTOR
GENERAL MICHAEL HOROWITZ'
REPORT ON THE FBI'S HANDLING
OF THE HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL
INVESTIGATION.
THE DOCUMENT IS SET TO BE
RELEASED ON THURSDAY OF THIS
WEEK.
REPORTEDLY USES THE WORD
"INSUBORDINATE" TO DESCRIBE
JAMES COMEY'S BEHAVIOR
DURING HIS TIME AT THE FBI.
HERE IS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
ATTORNEY RUDY GIULIANI JUST
YESTERDAY.
>> FIRST THING WE ARE GOING
TO GET IS A REPORT FROM
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S HOROWITZ
ON COMEY'S HAND LINKS OF
HILLARY WHICH I THINK IS
GOING TO BE VERY, VERY
CRITICAL AS IT SHOULD BE.
COMEY REALLY, HAS A CHANCE
OF BEING PROSECUTED AS A
RESULT OF IT, BUT WE'LL SEE.
>> Harris: COMEY HAS
PREVIOUSLY DEFENDED HIS HAND
LINKS OF THE EMAIL PROBE BY
SAYING HE MADE THE BEST
DECISIONS POSSIBLE GIVEN THE
SITUATION.
LET'S BRING IN ALAN
DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW
PROFESSOR EMERITUS AND
AUTHOR OF THE BOOK "THE CASE
AGAINST IMPEACHING TRUMP."
ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU.
SO, TALK TO ME ABOUT REBECCA
GOMEZ AND JAMES COMEY.
IS
GOMEZ -- RUDY GIULIANI AND
JAMES COMEY?
IS HE RIGHT HE COULD FIND
HIMSELF IN LEGAL TROUBLE.
>> RUDY IS A GREAT FRIEND OF
MINE AND A GREAT LAWYER I
DISAGREE WITH CRIMINALIZE
POLITICAL DIFFERENCES IN
THIS CONTEXT.
I HAVE BEEN A LONG-TIME
OPPONENT OF TRYING TO
CRIMINALIZE POLITICAL
DIFFERENCES BY DONALD TRUMP
AND BY PEOPLE IN THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION.
AND NOW THAT THE SHOE IS ON
THE OTHER FOOT, I TAKE THE
SAME POSITION.
LET'S NOT TURN DISAGREEMENTS
INTO CRIMES.
EVEN IF HE ACTED
INSUBORDINATELY, THAT'S NOT
A CRIME.
AND WE HAVE TO START
DISARMING BOTH SIDES AND
STOP WEAPONIZING THE
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND
USING IT AGAINST POLITICAL
OPPONENTS.
SO, I HOPE THAT IF IS HE
CRITICIZED, THAT'S FINE.
IN THE MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS.
BUT, LET'S NOT TURN
CRITICISM INTO
CRIMINALIZATION ON EITHER
SIDE.
>> Harris: ALL RIGHT.
SO THAT'S RUDY GIULIANI'S
TAKE ON IT BUT, LET'S TAKE A
LOOK AND HEAR FROM BOB
GOODLATTE ON THE SAME TOPIC
BECAUSE WHAT HE IS SAYING IS
IF IT DOES PROGRESS TO THE
POINT WHERE COMEY OR ANYBODY
ELSE COMING OUT OF THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT
NEEDS FURTHER LITIGATION OR
PROSECUTION, THIS IS WHAT HE
SEES.
>> I THINK AND MANY OTHERS
IN THE CONGRESS CONTINUE TO
THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE
AN INDEPENDENT SPECIAL
COUNSEL SEPARATE AND APART
FROM THE WORK THAT
MR. MUELLER IS DOING.
>> YEAH.
>> TO HANDLE THESE POTENTIAL
CRIMINAL REFERRALS AND TO
LOOK INTO THIS MATTER FOR
THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING
FURTHER MATTERS BEYOND WHAT
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL DOES.
>> Harris: SO, ALLEN, WHAT I
HEAR CONGRESSMAN GOODLATTE
SAYING THERE IS LET'S HAVE
SOMEBODY TAKE A LOOK AT THIS
SO CAN YOU SEE WHETHER OR
NOT IT'S SIMPLY POLITICS.
>> WELL, THAT'S WHAT THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL IS DOING.
BUT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
TWO WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT.
I THINK IT WAS WRONG TO
APPOINT A SPECIAL COUNSEL TO
INVESTIGATE TRUMP.
I THINK IT'S EQUALLY WRONG
TO APPOINT A SPECIAL COUNSEL
TO INVESTIGATE COMEY.
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY THINKS
THAT.
>> Harris: EVEN THOUGH WE
KNOW HE HAS LEAKED
INFORMATION.
WE KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS
THAT JAMES COMEY HAS DONE.
AND BY THE WAY, POLITICALLY,
IS HE NOT MAKING EITHER SIDE
OF THE POLITICAL AISLE
HAPPY.
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT
THAT.
BUT, YOU DON'T TURN
POLITICAL OPPOSITION INTO
CRIMINALIZATION.
LEAK SOMETHING NOT A CRIME
UNLESS IT'S LEAKING OF A
GRAND JURY MATERIAL.
LET'S UNDERSTAND THAT THERE
ARE CRIMINAL STATUTES AND
THEY SHOULD BE DEFINED
NARROWLY AND WE SHOULDN'T BE
WEAPONIZING THE CRIMINAL
JUSTICE SYSTEM AGAINST
EITHER SIDE.
I WAS CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT
TRUMP.
>> Harris: OKAY.
>> WHEN HE CALLED FOR LOCKER
UP TO HILLARY CLINTON OR
LET'S HAVE A SPECIAL COUNSEL
TO HILLARY CLINTON.
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT
HE THINKS SPECIAL COUNSEL
ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT BUT,
IF HE THINKS THEY ARE
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS TO HIM,
THEY ARE SURELY
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS WELL AS
TO COMEY OR AS TO ANYBODY
ELSE WE HAVE TO HAVE NEUTRAL
PRINCIPLES.
THE SAME PRINCIPLES.
>> Harris: ALL RIGHT.
>> PEOPLE CONFUSE MY
ADVOCACY.
I'M NOT THERE AS ADVOCATE
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.
I'M AN ADVOCATE TO CIVIL
LIBERTIES.
>> Harris: ALLEN, I'M GOING
TO LOSE YOU AND I'M WHAT WE
KNOW TO BE TRUE OF EAFLTIONS
OF BIAS INSIDE THE FBI.
WE HAD TEXT MESSAGES FLOWING
BETWEEN AT LEAST TWO
EMPLOYEES THAT WE KNOW ABOUT
WHO WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Harris: WHO HE WOULD LIKE
TO PRESS AGAINST THIS
PRESIDENT AND WAS THERE BIAS
INSIDE THE FBI?
I MEAN, THE INSPECTOR
GENERAL IS LOOKING AT A
WHOLE LOT HERE.
>> AND HE SHOULD BE AND
THOSE ARE APPROPRIATE
FUNCTIONS TO THE INSPECTOR
GENERAL.
TO ME HAVING AN HONEST
INSPECTOR GENERAL AND WE
SOMEONE, OFF UNITED STATES OFF U
SOMEONE, OFF UNITED STATES OFF I
SOMEONE, OFF UNITED STATES OFF E
SOMEONE, OFF UNITED STATES OFF D
STATES THE NEED FOR A
SPECIAL COUNSEL.
>> Harris: WE KNOW THAT HE
CAN'T PROSECUTE, SO IF THERE
ARE SIGNS OF BIAS --
>> -- HE CAN'T PROSECUTE BUT
HE COULD RECOMMEND
PROSECUTION, BUT HE HAS TO
SHOW THAT THERE IS AN AL
ACTUAL CRIME COMMITTED AND
THAT CRIME WOULD BE
PROSECUTED WHETHER IT WAS
DONE BY A DEMOCRAT OR
REPUBLICAN OR AN
INDEPENDENT.
WE HAVE TO HAVE ONE STANDARD
OF JUSTICE FOR ALL AND WE
HAVE TO USE THE CRIMINAL LAW
ONLY AS A LAST RESORT WHEN
THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE YARD
THAT AN EXISTING STATUTORY
CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED.
I DON'T THINK THAT STANDARD
HAS BEEN MET.
>> Harris: INTERESTING.
>> FOR ANYBODY INVOLVED SO
FAR IN THIS WHOLE DISASTER
2000 16 ELECTION.
>> Harris: WAITING FOR THAT
IG REPORT TO COME OUT TO
TELL US EXACTLY AHEAD OF A
SENATE HEARING AS WELL.
SO WE'RE GOING TO LEARN A
WHOLE LOT LATER THIS WEEK.
