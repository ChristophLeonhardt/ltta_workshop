Italy is to send almost 500 troops to the border between Nisha and Libya saying it wants to control human trafficking and the smuggling of migrants Italy's Prime Minister has branded Nisha the main transit country in Africa for Europe and migrants troops will be deployed to fort madama on the border between Nisha and Libya an area described as a gateway for refugees who want to cross the Mediterranean top European officials have already called for military action however the toughest deals been sealed by Italy's interior minister who's raising eyebrows after boasting about his mafia tactics I'm gonna make him an awfully guarantee only when I reassured them that I was from Calabria a region where deals and alliances are sealed with blood did they finally agree to sign monitors were shocked by what they witnessed thousands of emaciated and traumatized men women and children piled on top of each other locked up in hangars with no access to the most basic necessities and stripped of the human dignity Amnesty International had previously raised allegations against the EU of complicity in the abuse of refugees it's supported its claims with this video where a Libyan Coast Guard is towing a refugee in the sea and another one is being whipped well as Europe struggles to find new solutions to the migrant crisis we discussed with experts the latest Italian decision to send troops to Libya I think this is some kind of emergency measure to finally stop the human trafficking to Europe unfortunately our Western imperialism actually let's to the situation Libya is currently in so I think without the end of conflict in Libya which was also cast by the Western intervention back already in 2011 I think there won't be an answer to this crisis the sad thing is and this is where the whole thing falls apart is this should not be an Italian initiative this should be a European initiative this should be a coordinated initiative and when you get a country like France for example negotiating with a different leader from mr. Siraj in Libya then you can see the degree of discontinuity that's going on this is something that should be tackled in a coordinated way within the European Union and it's manifestly failed to do so
