1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
the Daily Caller for whatever reason
because they did not have enough to do

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,029
because the eclipse wasn't enough to
keep them happy

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:12,030
decided to criticize the clothing worn
by barons from the headline was you know

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,170
it's about time the president's son
starts dressing the part some might

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,050
suggest is about time the Daily Caller
you know keeps opinions like this to

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,080
itself people like Chelsea Clinton let
me read this I have it right here

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,740
Chelsea Clinton in other words says it's
high time the median everyone leave bare

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,390
and trump alone and let him have the
private childhood he deserved ensure

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,079
Michael of course everyone should let
him have the childhood he deserves

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,500
of course the Daily Caller should be
criticizing his t-shirt which by the way

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,350
I like it would wear myself because it's
a very nice shade of red I mean John

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,789
he's a kid for Christ's sake you know
sometimes I think we really go too far

13
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,829
and our political rhetoric and the
things we tend to focus on allow him to

14
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,010
be a kid yes he's a kid in the White
House but at the end of the day he

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,719
should have all of the fun and
explorations any other typical American

16
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,650
kid and if that means wearing a shirt
and basketball shorts and maybe even a

17
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,240
baseball cap if he wants to let him do
that let him enjoy being young because I

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:00:00,000
can guarantee you when he gets older
he's going to wish it was young again
