00:00:14,393 --> 00:00:16,295
AN OPTION.

7
00:00:16,295 --> 00:00:17,496
IT'S CALLED THE CRY CLOSET.

8
00:00:17,496 --> 00:00:19,265
THE CLOSET IS THE CREATION

9
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:24,003
OF A ART STUDENT EXISTS FOR

10
00:00:24,136 --> 00:00:26,072

FUZZY STUFFED ANIMALS FOR

15
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:32,545
MAXIMUM COPING.

16
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:34,146
THE QUESTION IS IT TIME TO

30
00:00:56,202 --> 00:00:56,669
>> Tucker: SURE.

31
00:00:56,669 --> 00:00:57,803
DID YOU GO TO CLASS FOR TWO

32
00:00:57,803 --> 00:00:59,004
HOURS A WEEK AND GET DRUNK

>> OH, COME ON.

35
00:01:01,774 --> 00:01:02,875

00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:03,275
EXPERIENCE.

37
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:04,009
IT'S VERY STRESSFUL.

38
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:07,046
THEY ARE LEARNING.

39
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:08,114
THE FUTURE.

40
00:01:08,114 --> 00:01:09,415
THESE ARE OUR CITIZENS OF

41
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:09,782
TOMORROW.

42
00:01:09,782 --> 00:01:10,449
AND THEY ARE LEARNING AS

43
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:11,884
MUCH AS THEY CAN.

44
00:01:11,884 --> 00:01:13,919

THEY NEED THIS BIOENERGETIC

48
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,525
WAY TO GET OUT THEIR STRESS.

49
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:20,793
10 MINUTES OF A GOOD CRY IN

50
00:01:20,793 --> 00:01:22,394
A CRY CLOSET TO THEN BE

51
00:01:22,394 --> 00:01:23,763
PREPARED TO TAKE THOSE EXAMS

52
00:01:23,763 --> 00:01:24,463
FROM EVERYTHING THEY HAVE

53
00:01:24,463 --> 00:01:27,099
LEARNED IN THOSE CLASSES.

54
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:27,800

00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,236
TIME FOR TOUR DEFINE

56
00:01:30,236 --> 00:01:31,203
BIOENERGETIC ON THE SHOW SO

57
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:32,671
WE WILL LET THAT PASS.

58
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:34,006
>> THANK YOU.

59
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:35,241
>> Tucker: DOES THIS SUGGEST

60
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:37,042
SOMETHING ABOUT THE

61
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:38,410
FRAGILITY OF THEIR MENTAL

62
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:38,744
HEALTH.

63
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:40,012
IF YOU ARE SO STRESSED ABOUT

64
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:41,147
TAKING SOME DUMB TEST AT

65
00:01:41,147 --> 00:01:42,114
SOME DUMB SCHOOL DOESN'T

66
00:01:42,114 --> 00:01:43,149
THAT MEAN YOU ARE ON THE

67
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:44,116
EDGE OF A BREAKDOWN?

68
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:44,950
>> NO.

69
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,585
DON'T WE ALL NEED A GOOD OLD

70
00:01:46,585 --> 00:01:48,087
FASHIONED CRY?

71
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:49,388
THIS IS AN OLD FASHIONED

72
00:01:49,388 --> 00:01:50,856
REMEDY TO A MODERN DAY

73
00:01:50,856 --> 00:01:51,190
PROBLEM.

74
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,259
IT'S JUST ABOUT CRYING 10

75
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,493
MINUTES OF CRYING.

76
00:01:54,493 --> 00:01:55,661
EVERYONE NEEDS A STRESS

77
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:55,961
BALL.

78
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:59,698
MANY PEOPLE OWN STRESS PAL

79
00:01:59,698 --> 00:01:59,999
BALLS.

80
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:03,569
THIS IS INTERPRESENTATION OF

81
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:04,436
>> Tucker: LET'S SAY WE HAD

82
00:02:04,436 --> 00:02:04,804
A WAR.

83
00:02:04,804 --> 00:02:06,305
I DON'T KNOW, PICK A

84
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:06,639
COUNTRY.

85
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:07,940
CHINA CHALLENGED US WHERE WE

86
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,175
HAD TO MOBILIZE A LARGE

87
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:10,109
NUMBER OF AMERICANS TO

88
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:10,776
DEFEND THE HOMELAND.

89
00:02:10,776 --> 00:02:11,911
>> OKAY.

90
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:12,812
>> Tucker: BUT EVERYONE IS

91
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:13,145
CRYING.

92
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:19,418
WOULD ANYBODY BE LEFT TO

93
00:02:19,418 --> 00:02:21,187
FIGHT THE WAR.

94
00:02:21,187 --> 00:02:22,388
CAN YOU DEFEND A COUNTRY IF

95
00:02:22,388 --> 00:02:24,156
YOU ARE ENCOURAGING KIDS TO

96
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:25,191
CRY ABOUT FINAL EXAMS.

97
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:26,826
>> IF EVERYONE TAKES A

98
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:28,160
MOMENT ASIDE TO CENTER

99
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,994
THEMSELVES, GROUND

100
00:02:28,994 --> 00:02:30,129
THEMSELVES, HAVE A CRY,

101
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:31,831
MAYBE FOR TWO, THREE MINUTES

102
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:32,865
AND THEN GO FIGHT THAT ARE

103
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:34,066
WITH A, I'M SURE THE WAR

104
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:35,534
WOULD BE WON WITH PEOPLE

105
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:37,469
SUCH A GREAT STATE OF MIND.

106
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:38,437
>> Tucker: COULD YOU TAKE A

107
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:40,339
BREAK CONCEIVABLY BETWEEN

108
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:41,307
BATTLES TO CRY?

109
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:42,575
>> I THINK THE BREAK WOULD

110
00:02:42,575 --> 00:02:43,909
HAVE TO BE DONE BEFORE THE

111
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:45,277
BATTLE BUT THEY WOULD BE IN

112
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:46,512
THE RIGHT MIND SET BEFORE

113
00:02:46,512 --> 00:02:47,479
THAT BATTLE THAT THEY WOULD

114
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,280
WIN THAT BATTLE.

115
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,982
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS

116
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:51,183
WHOLE CLOSET IS ABOUT.

117
00:02:51,183 --> 00:02:52,551
THE CRY CLOSET IS ABOUT

118
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:53,953
GETTING THAT RIGHT STATE OF

119
00:02:53,953 --> 00:02:54,854
MIND.

120
00:02:54,854 --> 00:02:55,221
YEAH.

121
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:55,921
>> Tucker: WOULD YOU WANT TO

122
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:57,089
USE A CLOSET OTHERS HAVE

123
00:02:57,089 --> 00:02:57,923
CRIED IN?

124
00:02:57,923 --> 00:02:58,724
>> I DON'T THINK I WOULD

125
00:02:58,724 --> 00:03:00,092
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT

126
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:01,427
SOUNDS VERY COZY AND GOOGLE

127
00:03:01,427 --> 00:03:03,062
HAS DONE THIS OUT IN SILICON

128
00:03:03,062 --> 00:03:03,896
VALLEY.

129
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:06,098
SO MANY COMPANIES HAVE

130
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:07,666
CREATED PING-PONG TABLES AND

131
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,901
VERY COMFORTABLE CORPORATE

132
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:10,069
SETTINGS WHERE PEOPLE CAN

133
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:12,605
LET OFF STEAM.

134
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:13,539
>> Tucker: IF A CRY CLOSET

135
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:14,573
IS CALLED FOR HOW ABOUT LIKE

136
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:16,876
A PETTING ZOO LIKE A BUNNY

137
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:17,610
STROKING STATION.

138
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,577
IS THAT TOO FAR?

139
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:19,545
COULD YOU ENVISION THAT?

140
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:21,280
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S THE

141
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,614
FUTURE.

142
00:03:21,614 --> 00:03:22,648
IF PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE

143
00:03:22,648 --> 00:03:24,550
AND WORK BETTER AFTER BEING

144
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,018
CENTERED AND CALMER, THEN

145
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:26,685
WHY NOT?

146
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:30,222
BRING THE BUNNIES IN, YES.

147
00:03:30,222 --> 00:03:31,523
>> Tucker: LET ME ASK YOU A

148
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:31,924
MACROPOINT.

149
00:03:31,924 --> 00:03:32,591
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT

150
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:32,892
THIS.

151
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:34,593
I DON'T WANT TO SHOCK YOU OR

152
00:03:34,593 --> 00:03:34,960
ANYTHING.

153
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,295
I THOUGHT THE WHOLE IDEA WAS

154
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:37,596
TO GET PEOPLE TO COME OUT OF

155
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:38,330
THE CLOSET.

156
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,665
YOU ARE LOOKING IN THE

157
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:41,800
CAMERA AND SAY PEOPLE GO

158
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,135
BACK IN THE CLOSET.

159
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:44,937
DO YOU AS A PROGRESSIVE FEEL

160
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:45,804
GOOD ABOUT THAT.

161
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:47,606
>> GO IN FOR 10 MINUTES SO

162
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:49,008
CAN YOU COME OUT CONFIDENTLY

163
00:03:49,008 --> 00:03:49,742
AND FEEL GOOD.

164
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:51,010
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO INTO

165
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,012
THAT CRY CLOSET RIGHT BEFORE

166
00:03:53,012 --> 00:03:54,280
THE SHOW AND HAVE A GREAT

167
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,514
SHOW AFTERWARDS.

168
00:03:55,514 --> 00:03:56,682
>> Tucker: I KNOW THIS IS

169
00:03:56,682 --> 00:03:57,416
LIKE TELEVISION AND YOU

170
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,151
DON'T WANT TO BE TOO HONEST.

171
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:00,819
LET'S TRY TO PUSH THE LEVER.

172
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:03,188
>> I'M ALWAYS HONEST WITH

173
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:03,522
YOU.

174
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:04,223
>> Tucker: IF YOU KNEW A MAN

175
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:06,091
I COULD DATE THAT MAN.

176
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:07,459
I'M SORRY I HAVE GOT TO TAKE

177
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:09,228
A QUICK BREAK AND GO CRY IN

178
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:11,664
A CLOSET WHILE SQUEEZING A

179
00:04:11,664 --> 00:04:12,531
STUFFED ANIMAL, THAT WOULD

180
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:14,433
WRECK THE DEAL FOR IT,

181
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:14,800
HONESTLY.

182
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,868
>> PROBABLY SAY I'M GOING TO

183
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:17,903
GO CENTER MYSELF SO I CAN BE

184
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:19,004
A STRONGER, BETTER PERSON

185
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:20,505
FOR YOU, YEAH, I WOULD LOVE

186
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:21,106
THAT PERSON.

187
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:22,074
I THINK THAT'S GREAT.

188
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:23,108
I THINK THAT'S HEALTHY.

189
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:24,209
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE WITH

190
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:25,978
A HEALTHY PERSON.

191
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:27,212
>> Tucker: PART OF YOU WOULD

192
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:29,915
LOOK ON CON TEMP JUSTLY YOU

193
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:31,317
WEAK LITTLE FREAK STOP

194
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:31,784
CRYING, RIGHT?

195
00:04:31,784 --> 00:04:33,285
>> WHAT A STRONG PERSON WHO

196
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:37,323
UNDERSTANDS THEMSELVES OR

197
00:04:37,323 --> 00:04:40,793
HERSELF OR WHATEVER PRONOUN

198
00:04:40,793 --> 00:04:42,394
THAT PERSON WISHES TO BE

199
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:42,795
CALLED.

200
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:43,429
>> Tucker: I DON'T BELIEVE

201
00:04:43,429 --> 00:04:43,996
YOU FOR A SECOND.

202
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:45,397
YOU WOULD WANT TO THINK THAT

203
00:04:45,397 --> 00:04:46,131
AS A GOOD PROGRESSIVE YOU

204
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:47,466
WOULD THINK THIS IS

205
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:47,900
WHOLESOME.

206
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,601
THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH MY

207
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:49,969
IDEOLOGY.

208
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:52,204
ON A GUT LEVEL YOU WOULD SAY

209
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:53,205
STOP WHIMPERING.

210
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:56,108
>> EVERY PLACE HAS A CRY

211
00:04:56,108 --> 00:04:57,276
CLOSET AND EVERY PLACE HAS A

212
00:04:57,276 --> 00:04:58,777
SAFE PLACE.

213
00:04:58,777 --> 00:05:00,679
CRY CLOSET CAN BE THE

214
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:01,046
BATHROOM.

215
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:02,815
EVERYONE NEEDS A GOOD CRY

216
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:03,148
CLOSET.

217
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:04,316
OLD FASHIONED WAY OF LETTING

218
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:05,884
OUT STRESS AND RELIEVING

219
00:05:05,884 --> 00:05:09,021
TENSION.

220
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:09,621
>> Tucker: I'M GOING TO

221
00:05:09,621 --> 00:00:00,000
LEAVE IT.
