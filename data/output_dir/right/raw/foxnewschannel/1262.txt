1
00:00:00,143 --> 00:00:01,712
IT'S FASCINATING, IT'S HISTORIC

2
00:00:01,712 --> 00:00:04,615
AND IT IS MIND-BLOWING, JOHN

3
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:11,555
ROBERTS LIVE ON THE NORTH LAWN.

4
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:13,323
LET'S BRING IN JOSH LETTERMAN.

5
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:14,958
THIS IS MIND-BLOWING.

6
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:16,493
THE PRESIDENT WAS TEASING THE

7
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:17,828
MEDIA SAYING, WOULDN'T YOU LOVE

8
00:00:17,828 --> 00:00:20,130
TO SEE WHAT IS IN THE LETTER AND

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,231
HOW MUCH DO YOU GOT AND THE

10
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:22,599
LETTER WAS FASCINATING AND

11
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:23,767
INTERESTING AND THEN LATER HE

12
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:25,669
SAID NO, I HAVEN'T READ THE

13
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:26,637
LETTER YET AT ALL.

14
00:00:26,637 --> 00:00:28,505
>> RIGHT, TRACE.

15
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:30,507
CLEARLY THE LETTER WAS AN EXCUSE

16
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:33,010
FOR HIM TO COME HERE, HAVE THIS

17
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,111
HISTORIC INTERACTION WITH THE

18
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:34,745
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT.

19
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:37,381
THE LETTER IN AND OF ITSELF IS

20
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:37,914
SYMBOLIC.

21
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:41,118
IT'S NOT THE WHOLE DEAL HERE.

22
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:42,853
TO SEE HOW QUICK THE PRESIDENT

23
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:44,721
WAS AFTER THIS TWO-HOUR MEETING

24
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:46,223
TO RAISE THE EXPECTATIONS FOR

25
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:48,091
THIS SUMMIT THAT IS NOW

26
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,559
BARRELLING AHEAD ON JUNE 12.

27
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,031
DIDN'T REALLY SOUND LIKE A

28
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:54,765
GET-TO-KNOW-YOU MEETING.

29
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:56,667
SOUNDS LIKE A MAJOR MOMENT, THE

30
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:57,968
START OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

31
00:00:57,968 --> 00:00:59,903
TWO COUNTRIES AS HE SAID, THAT

32
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:04,074
HAVE NOT HAD DIPLOMATIC

33
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:05,441
RELATIONS IN DECADES.

34
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,977
NOW HEADING TO THE SUMMIT IN

35
00:01:06,977 --> 00:01:08,412
SINGAPORE, A LOT ON THE TABLE

36
00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:10,847
FOR THIS TO MEET THE BAR THAT

37
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:12,082
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SET TODAY.

38
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:15,252
>> IF YOU MISSED IT, WE'VE BEEN

39
00:01:15,252 --> 00:01:17,287
TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR AN HOUR

40
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:18,789
NOW.

41
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:22,192
I WANT TO PLAY SOME SOUND HERE

42
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:23,460
WHEN THE PRESIDENT TALK ABOUT

43
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,961
THE EVOLVING RELATIONSHIP WITH

44
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:27,631
THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH

45
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:27,931
KOREA.

46
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:28,899
WATCH THIS.

47
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:32,035
>> I THINK THEY'RE OKAY.

48
00:01:32,035 --> 00:01:32,703
THEY'RE GOOD.

49
00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:34,137
LIKE THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH A

50
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:37,374
COUPLE OTHER COUNTRIES?

51
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:37,941
PROBABLY NOT.

52
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:40,510
BUT I THINK THE RELATIONSHIP

53
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,112
WITH NORTH KOREA IS AS GOOD AS

54
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:43,346
IT'S BEEN IN A LONG TIME.

55
00:01:43,346 --> 00:01:46,550
THEY HAD NO RELATIONSHIP UNDER

56
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,286
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.

57
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:57,127
IT WAS NOTHING.

58
00:01:57,127 --> 00:01:59,396
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED A

59
00:01:59,396 --> 00:01:59,863
LONG TIME AGO.

60
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:00,764
GOT TO A CRITICAL POINT.

61
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:02,099
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED

62
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,334
MANY YEARS AGO.

63
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:07,938
NOT ONLY BY PRESIDENT OBAMA BUT

64
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:11,675
OTHER PRESIDENTS.

65
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:13,710
>> HERE'S THE AMAZING THING.

66
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,312
EVERYTHING IS GOING FORWARD,

67
00:02:15,312 --> 00:02:15,812
DOING WELL.

68
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:18,081
THE FUNNY THING IS, YOU TALK

69
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:19,583
ABOUT THE SOUTH KOREANS.

70
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,584
THEY BELIEVE THAT KIM YOUNG

71
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:22,519
CHUL, THE NUMBER 2 MAN IN NORTH

72
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,387
KOREA, IS A VERY BAD GUY.

73
00:02:24,387 --> 00:02:26,156
THEY BELIEVE HE WAS BEHIND IN

74
00:02:26,156 --> 00:02:28,291
THE ATTACK ON A NAVAL SHIP IN

75
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,260
2010 THAT KILLED 46 SAILORS.

76
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,328
WE BELIEVE HE WAS BEHIND THE

77
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:32,796
ATTACK ON SONY PICTURES.

78
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:34,431
THIS ISN'T A GUY THAT IS COVETED

79
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:36,199
IN THE UNITED STATES AND ALL OF

80
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,235
A SUDDEN YOU HAVE THIS MINI

81
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:39,669
SUMMIT TODAY THAT IS LEADING TO

82
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:41,204
THIS JUNE 12 SUMMIT.

83
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:44,808
THIS IS MOVING AT BREAK-NECK

84
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:46,643
SPEED.

85
00:02:46,643 --> 00:02:48,245
>> IT IS.

86
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:49,379
SUPPORTERS OF THE PRESIDENT SAYS

87
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,914
YOU DON'T MAKE FRIENDS WITH YOUR

88
00:02:50,914 --> 00:02:51,248
FRIENDS.

89
00:02:51,248 --> 00:02:52,482
YOU DON'T SEEK PEACE WITH PEOPLE

90
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:53,717
THAT YOU'RE ALREADY CLOSE WITH.

91
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:55,719
YOU SECRETARY IT WITH ENEMIES,

92
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,220
PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE REALLY

93
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,789
DIFFICULT ISSUES, LIKE THE ONE

94
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:00,857
YOU DESCRIBED.

95
00:03:00,857 --> 00:03:02,359
OUR PROBLEMS IN SOUTH KOREA'S

96
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:04,094
PROBLEMS WITH NORTH KOREA'S

97
00:03:04,094 --> 00:03:05,696
BEHAVIOR OVER MANY DECADES.

98
00:03:05,696 --> 00:03:07,364
THERE'S A WIDE GAP THAT NEEDS TO

99
00:03:07,364 --> 00:03:09,399
BE BRIDGED BY THE TWO COUNTRIES.

100
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,901
YOU KNOW, HE'S TALKING ABOUT HOW

101
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:13,136
THINGS ARE BETTER THAN THEY HAVE

102
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:14,705
BEFORE IN FOREVER.

103
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:16,239
A FEW MONTHS AGO, THE PRESIDENT

104
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,508
WAS THREATENING FEWER AND FURY.

105
00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:19,810
WHAT HAS CHANGED FROM THEN TILL

106
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,945
NOW OTHER THAN A CHANGE IN

107
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:22,312
RHETORIC?

108
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:23,914
WE HAVEN'T SEEN A CHANGE IN

109
00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:25,349
BEHAVIOR OTHER THAN THE THREE

110
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:26,616
AMERICANS THAT WERE RELEASED BY

111
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:27,017
NORTH KOREA.

112
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:28,852
ON THE KEY ISSUES THAT THE U.S.

113
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:31,121
AND ITS ALLIES ARE WORRIED

114
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:32,856
ABOUT, THE NUCLEAR ISSUES, THE

115
00:03:32,856 --> 00:03:34,257
OTHER TROUBLING BEHAVIOR, THAT

116
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:36,259
STILL HAS TO BE WORKED OUT BY

117
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,428
THE PRESIDENT AND KIM JONG-UN

118
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:39,763
WHEN THEY MEET IN SINGAPORE.

119
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:41,365
>> IF PEOPLE ARE THINKING THIS

120
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:42,966
IS ABOUT LUCY AND CHARLIE BROWN

121
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:44,501
AND MOVING THE FOOTBALL, THIS

122
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:45,669
MAN, THIS KIM YOUNG CHUL THAT

123
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:47,637
CAME HERE, HE HAS THE EAR OF KIM

124
00:03:47,637 --> 00:03:48,071
JONG-UN.

125
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:48,805
WE KNOW THAT.

126
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:51,008
HE WAS AT BOTH OF THE MEETINGS

127
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:52,175
WITH PRESIDENT XI IN CHINA.

128
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:54,244
HE WAS AT BOTH OF THE SUMMITS

129
00:03:54,244 --> 00:03:56,213
WITH SOUTH KOREA.

130
00:03:56,213 --> 00:03:57,180
HE WAS RIGHT NEXT TO KIM

131
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,514
JONG-UN.

132
00:03:57,514 --> 00:03:58,682
HE'S THE ONE THAT DELIVERED THIS

133
00:03:58,682 --> 00:04:00,183
LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT TODAY.

134
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:02,119
JOSH, MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, THE

135
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:03,420
LETTER WASN'T READ BUT IT SEEMS

136
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,922
LIKE THE LETTER ISN'T THAT

137
00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:06,289
IMPORTANT.

138
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:09,059
IT'S A SYMBOL, IF YOU WILL, FOR

139
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:10,694
THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, KIM

140
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:14,264
JONG-UN IS SAYING, OKAY, THIS IS

141
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:15,732
MY TOKEN OF RESPECT FOR THE

142
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:16,933
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

143
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:18,834
I'M GOING TO WRITE HIM A LETTER.

144
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:20,269
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IS IN IT.

145
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,370
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE MEETING

146
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,105
JUNE 12.

147
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:24,307
THIS IS A SYMBOL THAT THEY CAN

148
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:25,542
PUT IN A MUSEUM SOME DAY.

149
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:27,344
>> THAT'S RIGHT, A SHOW OF

150
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:27,711
RESPECT.

151
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:28,979
ONE LEADER TO ANOTHER.

152
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,748
IT'S AN EFFORT TO TRY TO CORRECT

153
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:34,251
WHAT WAS A SHOW OF DISRESPECT

154
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:35,685
THAT WAS TRUMP WAS COMPLAINING

155
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:38,255
ABOUT 1 1/2, 2 WEEKS AGO WHEN HE

156
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:39,489
CANCELLED THE SUMMIT.

157
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:40,357
NORTH KOREA TRYING TO SHOW THAT

158
00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:41,992
WE'RE HERE, WE'RE READY TO

159
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:43,527
ACTUALLY MAKE THIS GO FORWARD.

160
00:04:43,527 --> 00:04:46,196
THE OTHER SYMBOLIC PART THAT WE

161
00:04:46,196 --> 00:04:47,731
SHOULDN'T LOSE TRACK OF, HOW

162
00:04:47,731 --> 00:04:48,532
SIGNIFICANT THIS WILL BE BACK

163
00:04:48,532 --> 00:04:50,534
HOME IN NORTH KOREA.

164
00:04:50,534 --> 00:04:52,369
THIS TYPE OF OVAL OFFICE

165
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:53,403
RECEPTION, A SENIOR OF NORTH

166
00:04:53,403 --> 00:04:55,105
KOREAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH

00:04:55,105 --> 00:04:57,174
THE PRESIDENT, VERY SIGNIFICANT.

168
00:04:57,174 --> 00:04:59,076
THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH A

169
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:00,310
MAJOR WORLD POWER THAT NORTH

170
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,845
KOREA HAS WANTED TO BE ABLE TO

171
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:05,115
PROJECT TO ITS PEOPLE FOR QUITE

172
00:05:05,115 --> 00:05:06,083
SOME TIME.

173
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,617
>> WE WERE STUNNED BY THE

174
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:08,785
PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT ENDING

175
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:10,287
THE KOREAN WAR AFTER SO MANY

176
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:10,587
YEARS.

177
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:12,422
I WANT TO PLAY THIS SOUND BITE.

178
00:05:12,422 --> 00:05:15,525
THIS IS FASCINATING.

179
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:15,859
WATCH.

180
00:05:15,859 --> 00:05:17,027
>> WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

181
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:18,862
WE TALKED ABOUT ENDING THE WAR.

182
00:05:18,862 --> 00:05:20,497
THIS WAR HAS BEEN GOING ON --

183
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:24,835
HAS TO BE THE LONGEST WAR.

184
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:25,902
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY SOMETHING

185
00:05:25,902 --> 00:05:29,306
LIKE THAT -- THAT'S MORE OF A

186
00:05:29,306 --> 00:05:31,008
SIGNING OF A DOCUMENT THAT IS

187
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:33,510
VERY IMPORTANT IN ONE WAY AND

188
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,245
HISTORIC LICK VERY IMPORTANT.

189
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:36,146
WE'LL SEE.

190
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:38,415
WE DID DISCUSS THAT.

191
00:05:38,415 --> 00:05:41,418
THE ENDING OF THE KOREAN WAR.

192
00:05:41,418 --> 00:05:43,020
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING

193
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,587
ABOUT THAT?

194
00:05:43,587 --> 00:05:45,655
>> NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT

195
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:47,991
REUNIFYING NORTH AND SOUTH

196
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:48,291
KOREA.

197
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,127
BUT SYMBOLISM GOES A LONG WAY.

198
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:51,194
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

199
00:05:51,194 --> 00:05:52,162
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

200
00:05:52,162 --> 00:05:54,564
SAYING JUNE 12, WE COULD SIGN A

201
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:55,666
DOCUMENT THAT COULD END THE

202
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,334
KOREAN WAR AFTER DECADES AND

203
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:58,569
DECADES AND DECADES.

204
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:02,239
THAT IN ITSELF IS SIGNIFICANT,

205
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,539
JOSH.

206
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:04,608
>> ITS HUGELY SIGNIFICANT.

207
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:07,878
IT WILL CREATE ANXIOUS ALLIES

208
00:06:07,878 --> 00:06:10,481
FOR THE U.S. LIKE JAPAN WHO SAYS

209
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:11,882
HOLD ON A SECOND.

210
00:06:11,882 --> 00:06:13,717
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO

211
00:06:13,717 --> 00:06:15,118
BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT ENDING THE

212
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:17,855
WAR THAT HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE

213
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,457
FOR DECADES, THE ARMISTICE

214
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:21,258
AGREEMENT IN PLACE.

215
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:22,593
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT THAT HAS NOT

216
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:23,594
BEEN IRONED OUT.

217
00:06:23,594 --> 00:06:25,496
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO BE ALREADY

218
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:27,698
TALKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO

219
00:06:27,698 --> 00:06:28,966
END THIS WITHIN A COUPLE WEEKS

220
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:31,835
SEEMS TO SUGGEST A RUSH TO HAVE

221
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:32,836
CONCILIATION WITH NORTH KOREA

222
00:06:32,836 --> 00:06:35,072
THAT MIGHT NOT BE BACKED UP BY

223
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:37,608
THE KINDS OF FACTS THAT OUR

224
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:40,210
ALLIES IN THE REGION REALLY WANT

225
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:40,711
TO HEAR ABOUT.

226
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:42,713
>> YEAH, THE FIRST PART OF THIS

227
00:06:42,713 --> 00:06:45,682
AND I'LL LET YOU GO, THE FIRST

228
00:06:45,682 --> 00:06:47,685
PART OF THIS NEWS CONFERENCE,

229
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:49,420
THE PRESIDENT SAID IT'S A

230
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,020
PROCESS.

231
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,221
MIGHT TAKE SEVERAL MEETINGS.

232
00:06:51,221 --> 00:06:52,489
THEN HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO END

233
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:54,158
THE WAR AND WHO KNOWS WHAT'S

234
00:06:54,158 --> 00:06:55,492
GOING ON AFTER THAT.

235
00:06:55,492 --> 00:06:56,927
IT REALLY WILL BE MAYBE MONTHS,

236
00:06:56,927 --> 00:06:57,661
MAYBE YEARS.

237
00:06:57,661 --> 00:07:00,097
GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME, THIS

238
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:01,765
IS A -- CERTAINLY A STEP IN THE

239
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:02,633
RIGHT DIRECTION.

240
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:04,335
>> IT IS.

241
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:07,137
LOOK BACK AT THE IRAN NUCLEAR

242
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:07,438
DEAL.

243
00:07:07,438 --> 00:07:08,539
THESE ARE DIFFICULT THINGS TO

244
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:09,106
WORK OUT.

245
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:10,908
NOT THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU

246
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,509
CAN EASILY FORESEE BEING WORKED

247
00:07:12,509 --> 00:00:00,000
OUT OVER A COUPLE HOURS IN
