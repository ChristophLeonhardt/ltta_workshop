yeah thanks a long time one cable this is last month's bill from time warner cable 171 dollars and two cents I didn't even order any movies on demand I'm tempted to cut the cord but I've heard that you can get your monthly bill reduced just by calling and threatening to cancel service in 2013 time warner cable lost 850,000 cable TV subscribers the company employs retention specialist whose job it is to retain customers so i decided to get one on the phone hi I'm calling about my cable bill it's getting too expensive and I'm thinking about canceling Time Warner altogether that sounds great sir well that was pretty easy all I did was suggest that I might cancel my cable subscription in 20 minutes later I got twenty dollars knocked off my monthly bill and faster internet but this is America after all so I decided to go back and see if I could get even more shaved off the bill I'm thinking about canceling because it's too high but it didn't work the representative I spoke to reference my previous call and I wasn't able to get any additional discounts or services but I did learn something about how Time Warner Cable sets its prices our packages majority of them are customized what one customer has may not be available in the same bundle package at what another customer has because it all depends on what is available for the representative to be able to customize it for you in other words everything is negotiable the FCC is aware of this practice but doesn't regulate it I asked time warner cable to explain their retention policy but they wouldn't go into too much detail for what they call competitive reasons bottom line is if you spend 20 minutes on the phone you can probably knock a few hundred bucks off your yearly cable bill and now I've got 20 extra dollars a month I can spend on movies on demand from time warner cable
