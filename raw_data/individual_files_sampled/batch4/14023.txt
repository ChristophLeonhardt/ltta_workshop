you know that line from 1984 big brother is watching you oh it's true in more ways than one like for example if you happen to own a hunt camp out in the hinterland well apparently the tax man wants his piece of the pie too and he'll go to elaborate lengths in order to get it the landowner magazine has a very interesting tale about government agencies going on the hunt for hunt camps that is as writer Joanne Cooney notes a hunt camp can be anything from a small shed to an insulated building but hunt camps are certainly not homes there's no civic address no postal delivery there's no garbage pickup and generally no hydro or maintained Road yet incredibly the authorities are employing new technology to find out where such structures exist why well it's all about shaking down property owners for building permits and supplementary tax bills even though in some cases we could be talking about a glorified outhouse in the middle of nowhere just consider the bizarre case of the McNab family which purchased a 300 acre farm in Mississippi Mills Ontario in 2007 as Cooney notes in her story the local councillor for the McNab's reportedly told them they could build a hunt camp on this rural property because the primary use of land is for hunting but in 2016 the McNab's allegedly received a registered letter from the town's chief building official the letter stated that it had recently come to the municipalities attention that a hunt camp had been built on their property and for failing to apply for a permit some nine years earlier this may result in a fine of $500 per day now here's where things get really interesting in their ongoing tussle with the township the McNab's learned that their hunt camp had been discovered via the use of Google Earth imaging furthermore the chief building official made it clear that all hunt camps were being investigated via and the owners of these structures would be required to retroactively Lee obtain building permits so it would appear that government agencies are spying on citizens so that their coffers can be enriched all the while hoping we won't catch on to this abuse of authority indeed I reached out to Tom black president of the Ontario landowners Association he notes that section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees that everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure specifically he also points to section 26 of the Charter which states the guarantee in this charter of certain rights and freedoms shall not be construed as denying the existence of any other rights or freedoms that exist in Canada translation well according to black this section notes that common law rights are indeed to be respected but the McNab saga continues to drag on last October the mcnabbs received a supplementary property tax bill for almost seven thousand dollars for their hunt camp even worse according to the report the township completely screwed up the assessment erroneously determining that the tiny hun camp was a two-story 3,100 square foot structure for student with three bedrooms and two bathrooms to add insult to injury the only way to untangle this snafu was to pay the erroneous bill and then allow authorities to come onto the property to inspect the hunt camp at which point the McNab's could formally challenge the assessment and then if their challenge proves successful they'd receive a credit on a future property tax bill and this is where the McNab's are today mired in bureaucratic red tape thanks to our tax dollars being squandered by government agencies and listen T spawn on our private property in summary two things come to mind next time the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is formally tinkered with how about the inclusion of private property rights and secondly if big brother is truly into conducting whiz-bang surveillance how about using such techniques to keep tabs on all those returning Isis fighters to Canada you know when they're not preoccupied with their poetry reading sessions oh wait what am I saying those suggestions aren't gonna fly not in this current political climate which seems to dine out on penalizing the makers in order to give to the takers for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's I'd Menzies hey folks if you like that commentary please consider becoming a rebel premium subscriber and never miss another rebel video you
