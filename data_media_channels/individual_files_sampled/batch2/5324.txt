so mr. Mehra I've spoken a lot about what we need from Republicans in this and and we need them to speak out we are concerned the president will not we don't know where the end of this is and we're seeing that we now may not be at the end with the breaking news in lower Manhattan and now in New Castle Delaware but as Democrats I would speak to you now and say that we need to immediately press reset I want to be honest I've been highly reactive in my emotions and fears about this president and I've shown some of that even this morning we don't know who sent the packages but I do know in my heart that President Trump there's a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that made it almost inevitable that top Democrats and the media would be targeted we know that what Trump wants before the midterms is a brawl a battle of conspiracy theories unhinged accusations and violent rude behavior Democrats don't do it hold back don't try and intimidate Republicans from public and when they're at public places like restaurants don't do it a tactic explicitly encouraged by Maxine Waters don't do it don't do it don't say it Maxine don't say we can't be civil in dealing with Republicans like Hillary Clinton said don't say we should kick Republicans as another former government official said don't get in the gutter with this man and this rhetoric that's what he wants that's what he wanted during the Brett Cavanaugh hearings and he got exactly what he wanted and we gave it to him to an extent these bombs so chaos Trump thrives on chaos Democrats can win by doing the right thing we may have to lose badly for a while before we win in the right way but we can't win in the wrong way mayor de Blasio and I'm worried that we have reacted so emotionally and with so much shock and horror that we can be pulled in and that false flag can be raised right on the Democrats if we're not careful moving forward toward the midterms would you concede this is possible thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more for morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
