I was in an MBA training program in debt markets where I learned so much I was a philosophy and theology major in college and and went to work on Wall Street because that's what you did in 1989 if you wanted to be rich and I wanted to be rich and it was great it taught me about corporate culture told me a lot about New York on a practical level of talking the art of negotiation it taught me time value of money it taught me you know all the kind of business principles that I could certainly apply to everything I do but I think more than anything else it was a real lesson and an eye-opening experience in humanity and the severity of business and you know how things get done in the big city of New York you're wasting my time and I don't like to have my time wasted there's a probably a lot of people who would say that my attitude or the way I deal with things is a little bit abrupt and severe sometimes people can take offense to that but it's been very effective for me because it allows me a lot of agility it allows me to deal with problems in a very effective way and there's definitely a tonne of that in the finance world because there's you know there's less about customer service inhumanity and more about you know return and margin but I think that overall it's a positive thing because the alternative is not knowing how to make money not knowing the time value of money not knowing what margin is and that really leads you to be doomed to failure or whatever business you're in I'm lucky enough that I think that my passion for everything Italian Italian food or wine really creates a balance and takes the edge off of what could be a really hard business and I think that that temper is my one of when I get to be a little bit too hardcore it takes the edge off it it Tunes me into much more of the humanity of what we do because at the end of the day all these restaurants and all these stores were just giving people what they need to eat
