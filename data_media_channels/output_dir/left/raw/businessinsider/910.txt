<font color="#E5E5E5">you take the right and I think we've</font>

32
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,719
already cleared that up and he said

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly that but the president has</font>

34
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,020
already said clearly when you referred

35
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,310
to wiretapping he was referring to

36
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,869
covalent so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point that it</font>

37
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,369
sounds like Shonda can't you and the

38
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,260
president saying now well we don't need

39
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,760
wiretapping anything you know if that's

40
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,439
not true we know that we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

44
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,430
the end of the day we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

45
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,930
for three or four days what's a parent

46
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,580
the President had to quote wiretapping

47
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,890
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> quote he was referring to broad</font>

48
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,259
surveillance that came on vacation going

49
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,729
on into whether the right I find it

50
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,829
interesting that you can somehow believe

51
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">the US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to be looking at these</font>

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,920
to believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have all of this</font>

54
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,360
information you've been read in on all

55
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,860
of these things which I find very

56
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,040
interesting how sincere you<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

57
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,899
