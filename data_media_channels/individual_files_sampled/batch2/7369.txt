all right guys bread Cavanaugh is now on the United States Supreme Court confirmed sworn in so I think it's a disaster in eighteen different ways obviously all the allegations the perjury but beyond that don't forget about the substance so I abducted two of them most strenuously on the substance which is these Pro Citizens United well that's the one I'm gonna get back to here because it is an interesting twist on that if you ask me he's Pro big business against employees potentially against Roe vs. Wade and the list goes on and on and on he's massively right-wing okay so what where in the world is the upside okay can we at least now move beyond this absurd talk of no let's not do an amendment to get money out of politics because that's alright we're gonna win the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court justices will get money out of politics we're done with that we're completely done with it so first of all the Democrats have shown that they're completely incompetent in being able to get anyone onto the Supreme Court they didn't fight at all for Merrick garland for 14 months not a single shred of a fight meanwhile these guys will pick the worst guys in the world the right most right wing with terrible allegations against them and fight tooth and nail besides which it's already too late there's five massively right-wing justices on the Supreme Court and they're going to be there for decade after decade so I remember when we started talking about getting money out of politics a lot of people including some top progressive groups and all Democrats were like that's radical we'll just win the Supreme Court later oops I told you that strategy was a disaster and it proved to be an even bigger disaster than I predicted and now by the way and this is really important why amendment is the only thing left now even if you somehow miraculously got Congress to pass legislation to get money out of politics this right wing Supreme Court would kill it year after year decade after decade and declare it unconstitutional because they and their rich friend they believe have endless rights in terms of what they call freedom of speech what we the rest of us call bribery here I'll make a prediction ahead of time - I bet that Kavanagh glass on the Supreme Court Susan Collins challenges the millions of dollars raised against her by regular people and that Kavanagh who should of course recuse himself does not recuse himself and that this right-wing Court goes yes regular people donating the Sousa against Susan Collins is unacceptable we're gonna take their speech rights away we're gonna take any of the rights that they have a way but corporations will share robots they are actual human beings they're superhuman beings and they can give the Susan Collins all they like but regular people can't give against her that's my prediction as to what's gonna happen but you don't need predictions if you're a progressive out there it's over it's over you're not going to get legislation and if you do it's going to be declared unconstitutional and you're not gonna get the Supreme Court to be in favor of any kind of movement to get money out of politics whether it's public financing or anything else they will strike it down for decade after decade we are done with it there's only one app option left and that is an amendment and you think India 2/3 of this corrupt Congress to pass an amendment there's only one way for an amendment that is through a convention you must get the states to call it convention that's what Wolfpack does for God's sake join right now if you're angry you want to do something about him make Kavanagh irrelevant that's what you could do and that's wolf dash pack.com /join okay so the one upside is not about politics that's a different ballgame and it's a very hard thing to predict and I don't know what the Democrats thing and if they think they were cute or clever on the politics front and they K in the case of Cavanaugh no the one upside is hashtag nothing but amendment we got to do an amendment there's nothing but an amendment left you must get money out otherwise remember the original reason they picked Kavanagh is not because of any of this though the original reason they picked him because he was the most pro corporate just judge in the country he said that SeaWorld can't can have their workers died through their negligence and he doesn't care that's the employees problem not the employers from Gorsuch same thing so you should freeze to death if your employer you too and if you don't agree to die for your employer you should be fired those are the two monsters they put on the Supreme Court so if now if you're not spending oh you know the great majority of your energy on getting an amendment you get money out of politics you're not gonna be able to win on electoral issues you're not going to be able to win on the Supreme Court we're not gonna be able to get anything done we have go half the pivot towards the department not just those we've been there all along everybody we got to go right now because the only thing above the Supreme Court is a constitutional amendment we must fight like hell for that and if you ever hear a so-called progressive or Democrat telling you don't do an amendment or don't do a convention to get amendment that means unfortunately whether they realize it or not they're on the side of the bad guys the guys saying don't do change we'll wait for the Supreme Court that proved to be a joke that's the only thing left is the biggest fight of all and amendment to get money out of politics let's do it right now
