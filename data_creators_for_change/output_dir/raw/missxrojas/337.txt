a book that I really enjoyed reading and

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,550
as much for the writing as for how it

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,280
broke and destroys every atom of my soul

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,200
and and clearly i think felt the same

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,420
way like when did you read the<font color="#CCCCCC"> book was</font>

25
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,890
that she was in the film I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like I've</font>

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,850
stories I can deal with but for this one

28
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,500

it particularly British yeah I got very

30
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,420
snobby and was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit worried and then I</font>
