DANA PERINO. "THE FIVE" ." DONALD TRUMP NICKED THE IRAN DEAL WHICH HE SAID HE WOULD DO ALL ALONG. I AM ANNOUNCING TODAY THAT THE UNITED STATES WILL WITHDRAW FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. WE WILL BE INSTITUTING THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF ECONOMIC SANCTIONS. ANY NATION THAT HELPS IRAN AND ITS QUEST FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS COULD ALSO BE STRONGLY SANCTIONED BY THE UNITED STATES. AMERICA WILL NOT BE HELD HOSTAGE TO NUCLEAR BLACKMAIL. TODAY'S ACTION SENDS A CRITICAL MESSAGE. THE UNITED STATES NO LONGER MAKES EMPTY THREATS. WHEN I MAKE PROMISES, I KEEP THEM. Greg: BEFORE THAT, APPARENTLY JOHN KERRY SPOKE TO IRANIAN LEADERS ABOUT SAVING THE DEAL. I DON'T BLAME THE GUY. KERRY'S LEGACY IS UNRAVELING FASTER THAN A MUMMY ON A MERRY-GO-ROUND. THE WHOLE POINT OF THE IRAN DEAL WAS LEGACY, IT WASN'T SECURITY. BEFORE THIS DEAL, IRAN WAS ON THE ROPES. THE ECONOMY WAS HEADED INTO NORTH KOREAN TERRITORY AND IT WAS ABOUT AS STABLE AS JOHN KERRY ON A SKATEBOARD. THEN WE THREW THEM A LIFELINE. STUPID. WE WENT TO NEGOTIATE WITH APOCALYPTIC THEOCRAT'S AND WE SENT THIS GUY. DO JAMES TAYLOR STROM SOME MUSIC? THE IRAN DEAL, THE NEW GUY, TRUMP, TORE IT DOWN. DOES THIS MEAN WAR? IF YOU THINK THE CURRENT PRESIDENT HARBORS A GRUDGE AGAINST IRAN, YOU'D BE WRONG. HE SEEMS WILLING TO TALK TO JUST ABOUT ANYONE. THE ONLY THING HE HATES HIS DUMB DEALS. HE WOULD RATHER START, THIS IS HIS VERSION OF A RESET WITH LEVERAGE. IRAN'S LEADERS WILL NATURALLY SAY THAT THEY REFUSED TO NEGOTIATE A NEW DEAL. THEY REFUSE, AND THAT'S FINE. I WOULD PROBABLY SAY THE SAME THING IF I WAS IN THEIR POSITION THING IF I WAS IN THEIR POSITIO POSITION. BUT THE FACT IS THEY ARE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE A NEW AND LASTING DEAL. ONE THAT BENEFITS ALL OF IRAN AND THE IRANIAN PEOPLE. WHEN THEY DO, I AM READY, WILLING, AND ABLE. GREAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN FOR IRAN COMMAND GREAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN FOR THE PEACE AND STABILITY THAT WE ALL WANT IN THE MIDDLE EAST. Greg: THAT'S NICE. FOR THOSE OF YOU IN A PANIC, REMEMBER THAT YOU FELT THAT WAY ABOUT NORTH KOREA TOO. AS TRUMP DEALS WITH THE WORST ON THE PLANET, HE SCRATCHES OFF ISIS AND NORTH KOREA, IRAN SEEMS NEXT. IT'S A SKILL SET THAT HISTORY WILL BE KINDER TO THAN JOHN KERRY.
