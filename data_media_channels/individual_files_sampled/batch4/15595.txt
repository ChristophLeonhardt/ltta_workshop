rap is really popular in Cajon right now but it's not the kind of rap you expect young Polish people are more conservative and religious than the young people in the West and that means the rap industry in Poland is really vastly different kirat nm is one of the most popular conservative and Catholic rappers in Poland he has a huge back catalogue of tracks and music videos which explore everything from faith and family to tradition immigration and even the biased mainstream media he takes on the issues that young people in Britain and America often completely ignore and uses his artistic medium to give a positive message to the young people of Poland I really loved one of his videos in particular which roughly translated into smashed the media the video saw him and his friends destroying television sets and radios using hammers and sickles with even mothers and grandmothers getting in on the action spoorthi other video see him rapping alongside priests and nuns his bizarre but it's brilliant and he was kind enough to invite me and my friend Adam who could help with translation over to his boxing gym to tell us more about the work he does in the rap industry and with young people so Pavel you're a patriotic Polish rapper thank you for meeting me could you tell me um Western rap is about sex drugs that kind of thing yours isn't is it yeah my my rap is more of the reality content but we also focus a lot of on sport and I am aware that maybe it might sell a little less it won't be on the top shelf but I feel that it's worth doing it I also put my heart into giving young kids boxing training and try to do things that are what do you think about Western pop culture and rap and that kind of thing it can be pretty harmful for especially young people and unfortunately it's not just in the West but it also exists here in Poland some rappers are bound to to go down that path rapping about stuff like sleeping around and partying and drugs but I feel that this isn't the way to go so faith would you say that faith is a big part of young patriotism absolutely patriotism is tightly connected to faith and Christianity in Polish history during the Warsaw Uprising or the anti-communist military underground the so called curse soldiers they often guided their actions driving from faith and so their patriotism was connected to it so it's mine and there are many many important things family for example it's also something that it all unites with with one thing and but God needs to be put on the first place this is something we often repeat if God is put in the first place then the rest will will follow and everything will be good could you tell me about your smash the media rap video that I saw on YouTube why do you hate the media so much that's it yeah this piece was directed against the mainstream media which very often does full attacks on our heroes and our values and we absolutely think that this is wrong it's the kind of media that every time tries to affect somebody in a political way and assert to a certain political party or a certain political viewpoint and they are trying to poison the minds of people that receive this message so we are absolutely against it and this is this is something that has to be why do you do what you do what is your ultimate goal with your work with children and with the rap I believe that God in many ways has directed me on my path and I feel like I'm on a mission and I'm a boxing coach I'm helping young people this is something that I think it's very important this is something that we all should should strive for we should always try to improve and everybody has their their ways in life so all you can do is stay positive you shins and some young people in Britain have completely abandoned their faith they're extremely far left they're pro mass immigration what message do you have to young people in Britain who hates Britain about what's going on in the UK but we all know that there is a wave of Islam coming into Europe and there is a problem that if you don't put God in first place other things will come in and negative values will spread for example the abortion people abandoning the idea of family so this is my advice for them follow God go back to the to the right path and these these problems hopefully not spread what would your advice be to young Patriots who are scared of the far left yeah I would say that don't fear point in doing it if you have faith in God and you feel that you have God with you there is a saying in the Bible that if we have God on our side then who can be against us so do your best to protect with the Western Latin civilization and stay true to your values and always put garden in first place so many young people fight politically how important do you think it is to fight culturally - absolutely there are many other ways than just politics you can for example fight by for good values by making documentaries for example some people record movies documentaries and unfortunately today there are many films that are influenced by the left-wing they are trying to take over media and culture and here in Poland for example we had a problem with communism they killed our priest they they try to justify it with different propaganda measures but people were fighting back I myself I'm I'm making music I'm working with young people here and in the boxing club and trying to make things better I'm also involved in an organization that promotes the memory of the anti-communist military underground which fought in Poland after World War two and we do different things with them we try to help the old army veterans that's today are old and need need help we also try to make people prepare for being ready for battle so it's being prepared for prepared for military conflict you can always practice and somehow enhance your your your capabilities of fighting back if something would happen so there are many different things that you can do and I encourage everybody to get involved in at least something so that the world can be better it's kind of funny thank you so much appreciate it Cheers the media is branding Poland as racist simply for voting more conservatively than ever I'm here covering the real story about Poland that this is a country that embraces its faith tradition and history with a young population that's more conservative than ever I can't cover these stories without your help so if you'd like to support this trip please go to rebel Poland calm if you'd like to help us cover our modest expenses for this trip please go to rebel Poland calm you
