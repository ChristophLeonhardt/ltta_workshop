BOWING REVENGE AFTER AN ATTACK

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:09,858
THIS WEEKEND AT A MILITARY

4
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:12,561
PARADE LEFT AT LEAST 25 PEOPLE

5
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:13,962
DEAD AND 60 MORE ROUNDED.

6
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:15,130
IRAN SAYS THE U.S. AND ISRAEL

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,999
ARE AMONG OTHERS, THEY ARE ALL

8
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:19,201
TO BLAME.

9
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,836
ALSO BREWING, CIA DIRECTOR GINA

DRAGO’S REAL INTENTIONS.

13
00:00:26,408 --> 00:00:27,109
FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR DANIEL

14
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:29,177
HOFFMAN IS HERE TO BREAK IT

15
00:00:29,177 --> 00:00:29,978
DOWN.

16
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:30,646
GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.

17
00:00:30,646 --> 00:00:31,780
I HARDLY KNOW WHERE TO START.

18
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,750
WE HAVE SO MUCH GOING ON.

19
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,785
THE U.S. IS DISAVOWING

20
00:00:36,785 --> 00:00:37,986
CONNECTION WITH THIS MASS

21
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:39,788
SHOOTING IN IRAN AT THE MILITARY

22
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:39,788
SHOOTING IN IRAN AT THE MILITARY

23
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:40,155
PARADE.

24
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:42,991
HERE IS WHAT FORMER AMBASSADOR

25
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:43,726
ANTONELLA SECURITY ADVISOR JOHN

26
00:00:43,726 --> 00:00:46,228
BOLTON HAD TO SAY.

27
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:48,630
>> AS I HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY,

28
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,199
REGIME CHANGE IN IRAN IS NOT THE

29
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:50,199
REGIME CHANGE IN IRAN IS NOT THE

30
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:52,968
ADMINISTRATIONS POLICY.

31
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:55,471
AS MIKE POMPEO JUST SAID, WE

32
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:56,138
HAVE IMPOSED VERY STRINGENT

33
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:57,506
SANCTIONS ON IRAN.

34
00:00:57,506 --> 00:01:00,042
MORE ARE COMING.

35
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:02,011
WHAT WE EXPECT FROM IRAN’S

36
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:03,746
MASSIVE CHANGES IN THEIR

37
00:01:03,746 --> 00:01:04,212
BEHAVIOR.

38
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:07,083
UNTIL THAT HAPPENS, WE WILL

39
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,617
CONTINUE TO EXERT WITH THE

40
00:01:08,617 --> 00:01:10,386
PRESIDENT HAS CALLED TO MAXIMUM

41
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:10,753
PRESSURE.

42
00:01:10,753 --> 00:01:13,356
THAT IS WHAT WE INTEND TO DO.

43
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:14,557
>> Shannon: HOW DOES THIS

44
00:01:14,557 --> 00:01:15,758
ADMINISTRATION SPEAK TO THE

45
00:01:15,758 --> 00:01:17,360
IRANIAN PEOPLE AND GO PAST THE

46
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,194
REGIME?

47
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:19,195
IS IT POSSIBLE?

48
00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:20,363
>> THE IRANIAN REGIME IS TRYING

49
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:21,898
TO REFLECT FLAME FOR EVERYTHING

50
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:24,400
THAT IS WRONG AND IRAN.

51
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,636
RIGHT NOW THEIR ECONOMY IS IN

52
00:01:26,636 --> 00:01:27,804
FREE FALL, WE ARE SEEING

53
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:29,572
HYPERINFLATION, AND THEY WANT TO

54
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:29,572
HYPERINFLATION, AND THEY WANT TO

55
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:31,507
BLAME OTHERS AND THEY START WITH

56
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:31,507
BLAME OTHERS AND THEY START WITH

57
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:33,543
THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS

58
00:01:33,543 --> 00:01:36,012
THEIR SUNNI ENEMIES IN THE

59
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:36,813
REGION, LIKE THE UNITED ARAB

60
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:40,383
EMIRATES AND SAUDI ARABIA.

61
00:01:40,383 --> 00:01:41,785
THIS ATTACK THAT OCCURRED ON THE

62
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:41,785
THIS ATTACK THAT OCCURRED ON THE

63
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:43,787
BORDER OF IRAQ IN AN AREA THAT

64
00:01:43,787 --> 00:01:45,989
IS EXPERIENCED OTHER PROTESTS

65
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:47,524
FOR WATER SHORTAGES, HAS BEEN

66
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:51,027
VICTIMIZED BY SMUGGLING, IT WAS

67
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,996
PROBABLY AN INSIDE JOB AS WELL.

68
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:55,031
THESE GUYS WERE WEARING

69
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:55,565
SOLDIERS’ UNIFORMS.

70
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:57,100
THE IRANIANS WANT TO DEFLECT

71
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,203
THEIR BLAME FOR THE ON PROBLEM

72
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,371
AND BLAME OTHERS.

73
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,472
A COMMON TACTIC.

74
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:03,473
>> Shannon: AMBASSADOR BOLTON

75
00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:04,975
SAID THAT U.S. FORCES WILL NOT

76
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:06,076
BE LEAVING SYRIA ANYTIME SOON AS

77
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:06,076
BE LEAVING SYRIA ANYTIME SOON AS

78
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:09,012
LONG AS THEY FEEL LIKE IRAN HAS

79
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:11,014
SAID -- NOT JUST IRAN BUT

80
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:11,848
PROXIES, MILITIAS, HE SAYS THEY

81
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:14,418
WILL STAY UNTIL THEY ARE

82
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:15,052
COMPLETELY OUT OF SYRIA.

83
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:18,021
>> THE PROBLEM IS, IRAN DOESN’T

84
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:19,089
DO POST-CONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION

85
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:19,990
VERY WELL.

86
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,226
WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS TARGETING

87
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:22,226
WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS TARGETING

88
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:23,126
SUNNIS, INNOCENT SUNNI.

89
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:25,162
THAT IS NO WAY TO BRING ABOUT

90
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:27,264
THE RECONCILIATION THAT REALLY

91
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:28,966
IS REQUIRED TO ELIMINATE THE

92
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:29,566
TERRORIST THREAT.

93
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,801
WITH IRAN AND BOB CLEMENT

94
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:31,802
CARRIES ON BEING A PETRI DISH

95
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:34,338
GROWING THESE THREATS OF

96
00:02:34,338 --> 00:02:35,005
EXTREMISTS.

97
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:37,007
WE NEED TO BE THERE IN SOME

98
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:39,210
FORM, NOT A LOT OF TROOPS OR AN

99
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,211
INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITY BUT

100
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:42,146
ENOUGH TO PROTECT OUR INTERESTS.

101
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:42,146
ENOUGH TO PROTECT OUR INTERESTS.

102
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:43,814
>> Shannon: RUSH ALSO A PLAYER

103
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:45,516
THERE, OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS NO

104
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:47,685
DISPUTE OVER WHETHER OR NOT

105
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:49,453
RUSSIA MAY BE SELLING FAKE

106
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:51,522
MISSILE-DEFENSE WEAPONRY TO

107
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:52,590
SYRIA.

108
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,959
POTENTIALLY VIOLATING SANCTIONS,

109
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:54,959
POTENTIALLY VIOLATING SANCTIONS,

110
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,394
U.S. SANCTIONS, AND GUIDELINES.

111
00:02:56,394 --> 00:02:57,962
>> THE RUSSIANS ARE INTERESTED

112
00:02:57,962 --> 00:02:58,896
IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOR A FEW

113
00:02:58,896 --> 00:02:59,597
REASONS.

114
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:00,965
THEY WOULD LIKE TO ELIMINATE OR

115
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:01,999
REDUCE U.S. INTEREST IN THE

116
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:03,401
REGION BUT THEY ARE ALSO

117
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,902
INTERESTED IN OIL SALES AMOUNT

118
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:07,071
IS POTENTIALLY A CONFLICT AREA

119
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:08,706
WITH IRAN BECAUSE IRAN’S OIL

120
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:10,174
SALES HAVE DECREASED AND A ROW

121
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:11,609
ARE INCREASING.

122
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:12,977
WEAPON SALES, GOING BACK TO THE

123
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:15,146
DAYS OF THE SOVIET UNION, IT’S

124
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:16,581
ABOUT SELLING WEAPONS.

125
00:03:16,581 --> 00:03:18,182
THEY ARE USING THIS MOST RECENT

126
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:20,652
ATTACK ON THEIR OWN AIRCRAFT AS

127
00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:22,587
ANOTHER PRETEXT FOR WANTING TO

128
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:23,621
DO THAT.

129
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:24,756
>> Shannon: A QUICK COMMENT

130
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:25,490
AND NORTH KOREA AS WELL AS THE

131
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,991
PRESIDENT IS AT THE

132
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:28,026
UNITED NATIONS, MEETING WITH

133
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:29,794
LEADERS OF JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA,

134
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:30,695
OTHER KEY PLAYERS.

135
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:33,231
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

136
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:33,832
CRITICIZED FOR NOT BEING

137
00:03:33,832 --> 00:03:34,266
MULTILATERAL.

138
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:35,634
LET’S LOOK AT I WAS AT THOSE

139
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:37,836
PARTNERS, RUSSIA AND CHINA.

140
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:40,605
CHINA HAS ABOUT 90% OF KOREA’S

141
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:42,507
TRADE, NEVER USED -- LEVERAGE TO

142
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:42,507
TRADE, NEVER USED -- LEVERAGE TO

143
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:43,642
FORCE KIM JONG UN TO

144
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:45,110
DENUCLEARIZE.

145
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,746
RUSSIA AND CHINA WANT TO REDUCE,

146
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:47,746
RUSSIA AND CHINA WANT TO REDUCE,

147
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:50,148
IF NOT ELIMINATE THE U.S.

148
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:52,150
MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE REGION.

149
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,150
MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE REGION.

150
00:03:52,150 --> 00:00:00,000
WE DON’T SHARE THE SAME WALLS.
