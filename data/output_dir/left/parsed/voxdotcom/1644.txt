yeah
a conservationist Paul Rosalee set out
to be eaten alive by a green anaconda
the armor will be Paul's only barrier
between life and death so we have the
force sensor on your back we're gonna be
able to measure how much force in this
anaconda constricted if this snake does
try to eat me this is because I'm so Ted
to toe in pig's blood so I really smell
like dinner to this animal the first
strike hits Paul's helmet
but the snake can't latch on
her way she does
oh my god
okay
gotcha
right man she was trying to do
everything she could kill me I didn't
have that suit my ribcage would have
lasted 30 seconds at that sneaking
command
you
