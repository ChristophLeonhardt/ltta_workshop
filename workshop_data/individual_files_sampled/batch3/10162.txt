National Geographic has admitted it went too far linking a starving polar bear with climate change saying in fact there was no way to know for certain why that bear was dying National Geographic went too far in drawing a definitive connection between climate change and a particular starving polar bear there is no way to know for certain why this bear was on the verge of death it's a sad picture no matter what the reason but Polly Boykin looks at how simply swapping the caption owed a whole new angle on the story you might remember these heart-wrenching pictures of a starving polar bear looking for food National Geographic ran them back in 2017 with a big caption claiming that this is what climate change looks like the images went viral the photographers estimate over 2 billion people saw them on YouTube alone the video got 1.5 million views and it also became one of the most viewed videos on national Geographics websites but it turns out that the photographer's original caption didn't make an explicit link to climate change they posted the videos saying that this is what starvation looks like but when National Geographic picked up the material to publish it skewed the narrative and it worked this is one bear it's not a once-off isn't a Lindley and there's the expectation that as climate change continues that this kind of image is going to be amplified again and again but that viral success troubled the photographers it was not the message they intended for viewers the mission was a success but there was a problem we had lost control of the narrative we were perhaps naive the picture went viral and people took it literally well now National Geographic has been forced to admit that it went too far in linking the dying bear to climate change and that there's no way of telling exactly why the stricken bear was on the verge of death so I've come to London Zoo to speak to the animal lovers here to find out if they feel like their sympathies have been manipulated by the media if the if the polar bear is is it stopping it could be climate changing for things like first their main praveen your water or there may be no food the jus the climate changes off but obviously it could also be fake advertisement for maybe charity purposes I think it may be fake because in Antarctica there wouldn't really be that many like hills and stuff I think it's 31 it is so you think that really the causes climate change exactly I mean that's why the glob warm blob yes it is so for you the magazine simply took what everybody would have thought about these images and said it yes no I wouldn't necessarily even read that I'd look at the picture and think poor thing do you feel like it's one of those situations where the media sometimes kind of manipulates you know the public definitely oh it that's that is it I mean we know that that happens we know that there is manipulation this picture is very a very powerful impact when you see it but then once you have the impression then it's very difficult to change your mind or take to get focus again on this news Oh probably not I feel like because a lot of other pictures as well all the ice is melted and stuff there's not anywhere for them to go to get their food anyway so probably is something to do with climate change so yeah climate change is clearly a serious issue that weighs heavily on the minds of many people but the question is whether it should negate serious reporting you
