TODAY THE ATTY. GEN. JEFF SESSIONS TESTIFIED, AND HE DID HIS DAMNEDEST TO SAY AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE. ALONG THE WAY HE CRAFTED THIS VERY INTERESTING BS LEGAL ARGUMENT FOR WHY HE DIDN'T NEED TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME NOT ASSERTING OR HAVING DONALD TRUMP ASSERT EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. THIS HAPPENED OVER AND OVER THROUGHOUT THE TESTIMONY, BUT WE WILL START OFF WITH SESSIONS. WHAT IS THE BASIS OF YOUR REFUSAL TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS? SEN. CAN, THE PRESIDENT HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL ñ BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT ASSERTED IT. YOU SAID YOU HAVE THE POWER TO ASSERT POWER OF EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE, SO WHAT IS THE LEGAL BASIS FOR YOUR REFUSAL TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS? I AM PROTECTING THE RIGHT OF THE PRESIDENT TO ASSERT IT. I WILL ASSERT IF HE CHOOSES. THERE MAY BE OTHER PRIVILEGES THAT COULD APPLY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE. IT'S BOTH INFURIATING AND FUNNY. HE IS SAYING THAT HE IS PROTECTING HIS RIGHT TO SOMEDAY EVER ASSERTED. WE ARE LED TO BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T KNOW THAT JUST SESSIONS WOULD BE TESTIFYING TODAY, AND DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE COULD EXIST ASSERT EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IF HE WANTED TO. IS THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING? I DON'T THINK SO. AGAIN BEFORE THEY EVEN CAME THEY WERE PREPARING FOR THIS. KELLYANNE CONWAY BEFORE HE EVEN CAME ON SAID SESSIONS IS WILLING TO COOPERATE AND SHARE WHAT HE KNOWS. SO OF COURSE ARE YOU SURE WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW? SO HE WILL SAY WHAT WE CAN SAY AND NOT SAY. THERE WERE REASONS BEHIND THIS WHOLE TESTIMONY IN THE FIRST PLACE. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY SAID ABOUT HIS WORRIES AND ISSUES WITH JEFF SESSIONS RECUSAL FROM THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION, ALSO IF HE IS RECUSED HOW MUCH OF A HAND HE HAD IN THE FIRING OF JAMES COMEY BECAUSE AS THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS FIRED BECAUSE OF THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, THAT HE WASN'T, AND THAT HE WAS, BUT THEN HE WASN'T, BUT THEN AFTER HE WAS. SO AS WE GO THROUGH THIS REMEMBER THERE WAS A LOT OF ANGLES. LAST WEEK WHEN KAMALA HARRIS WAS ASKING ABOUT HIS ANGLES AND POTENTIAL ALLOWANCE OF LETTING THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION GO, THAT IS THE REASON WHY THIS IS CULMINATED TO WHERE WE ARE? WE WILL TOUCH ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ANGLES. I WISH WE HAD MORE WE COULD REVEAL. WHEN YOU COMBINE THE FACT THAT HE APPARENTLY DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT HIS LIFE WITH THE FEW THINGS THAT HE DOES REMEMBER HE IS SAYING HE DOESN'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT. YOU GET ALMOST NO INFORMATION. I WANT YOU TO CONSIDER WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF EVERYONE TESTIFYING BEFORE CONGRESS OR BEFORE A SPECIAL COUNSEL USED THIS ARGUMENT. THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO ASSERT EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE BECAUSE SOMEDAY PERHAPS THE PRESIDENT MIGHT WANT TO. THAT IS COOL BECAUSE THEN YOU GET ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF EXERTING EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE WITHOUT HAVING THE OBVIOUS SUSPICIOUS NATURE OF THAT. I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK, I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS THAT IT IS WEIRD THAT HE REFUSES TO REVEAL ANYTHING ABOUT HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH DONALD TRUMP. ALL OF THESE INCREDIBLY RELEVANT QUESTIONS. I WOULD SAY THE REASONS SESSIONS WAS BROUGHT IN IN THE FIRST PLACE ñ HE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE SOMEDAY DONALD TRUMP MIGHT WANT TO USE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. THAT IS ABSOLUTE BS, NONE OF THE SENATORS WERE BUYING IT. I LOOKED AT THE MEDIA COVERAGE OF THIS AND INTERESTINGLY FOX NEWS, BREITBART, NO MENTION OF THIS WEIRD LEGAL STRATEGY IN THEIR COVERAGE. YOU NEED TO KNOW GOING IN THAT IS THE MAIN IMPEDIMENT TO US KNOWING MORE ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON. THEY DON'T WANT TO REVEAL ANYTHING, BUT THEY ALSO KNOW HOW BAD IT WILL LOOK IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO UNDER THEIR ACTUAL CONSTITUTIONAL ABILITIES. I DID SEE HIS OPENING STATEMENT. JEFF SESSIONS ñ HE ADMITTED THAT HE WAS IN A WAY INVOLVED WITH THE RECOMMENDATION TO FIRE JAMES COMEY. HE SAID I ADMIT IT, BUT JUST BECAUSE I RECUSE MYSELF FROM A RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE I WAS PART OF THE CAMPAIGN, DOESN'T MEAN THAT I AM NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE INPUT ON THE FBI DIRECTOR BECAUSE THERE ARE TONS OF INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON. AT LEAST HE ADMITTED THAT HE HAD A PART IN THAT, BUT THEN HE HAD A JUSTIFICATION FOR IT. EXACTLY. THE ISSUE OF WHETHER JUST SESSIONS AND HIS RECUSAL IS WORTH A DAMN WAS A BIG PART OF AT LEAST THE FIRST HALF OF THE TESTIMONY. HE HAS A GREAT QUOTE. HE ATTEMPTS TO DISTRACT, THIS WEIRD EMOTIONAL TANGENT. RESPECTFULLY, NOT ANSWERING THE QUESTION ñ WHAT IS THE QUESTION? JAMES COMEY SAID THAT THERE WERE MATTERS WITH RESPECT TO THE RECUSAL THAT WERE PROBLEMATIC AND HE COULDN'T TALK ABOUT THEM. WHAT ARE THEY? WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME? THEY ARE NONE SEN. THEY ARE NONE. I CAN TELL YOU THAT FOR ABSOLUTE ñ CERTAINTY. AND HE ALSO WENT ON TO SAY THIS EVENTUALLY. NO ONE IS ACCUSING YOU OF THAT, THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. I'D HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. THEY ARE ACCUSING YOU OF SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE. YOU ARE INVOLVED IN THE SIGN LETTER THAT RECOMMENDED THE JAMES COMEY GET FIRED. AS JAYAR JACKSON POINTED OUT, HIS DEFENSE IS SAYING I DIDN'T RECUSE MYSELF FROM EVERYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH THE FBI, WHICH IS TRUE. BUT YOU KNOW DAMN WELL THE SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP SAYING WHAT WAS ON HIS MIND, WAS THAT THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION IS A HOAX AND HE NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN. THE IDEA THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S THE PRINCIPAL THING THAT JAMES COMEY IS WORKING ON AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT, WE KNOW FROM NEWS REPORTS OF THE TIME THAT HE HAD JUST REQUESTED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THAT INVESTIGATION. HE IS FIRED INSIDE OF 48 HOURS OF THAT REQUEST. YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME SORT OF CASE THAT THIS DOESN'T VIOLATE RECUSAL IF WE FORGET EVERYTHING ELSE WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY.
