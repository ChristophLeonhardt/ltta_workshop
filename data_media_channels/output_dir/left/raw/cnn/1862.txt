1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,430
let's talk about delivering help after
Harvey the president says it is a top

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,070
priority do you have a plan to avoid the
politics that got in the way of the

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:17,910
sandy money we hope that everybody puts
politics aside to get help directly to

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,230
the people in a speedy fashion I mean we
know Chris after the devastating effects

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,580
of a storm like Harvey that the recovery
the rebuilding the relief efforts they

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,470
go on infinitely sometimes it feels like
we don't know if it'll be weeks months

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,489
years but this president and vice
president and cabinet stand ready to

8
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,170
assist those in need housing will be an
issue for many people who are displaced

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,399
their houses are either uninhabitable or
destroyed we know that we've been trying

10
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,020
to get food and water to people over two
and a half million meals over two

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,360
million liters of water as of yesterday
and perhaps more today clothing we know

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,289
that nongovernmental organizations are
also helping a great deal the media are

13
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,039
helping connect people with information
we're grateful for that but in terms of

14
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,810
the funding we hope that Congress will
focus on the president's priority which

15
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,909
is to connect the people in need with
the money and the resources that they

16
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,470
require to get immediate help but also
to help rebuild their lives that's why I

17
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,040
asked about the plan I get the
intentions and it's the right intention

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,780
especially in this type of emergency
situation but you know the cabinet

19
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,369
itself is filled with lawmakers who
voted against that sandy money what will

20
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,549
the president do if people play politics
with Harvey the way they did with Sandy

21
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:38,909
Chris the president has also said he
needs cut to rely on Congress we hope

22
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,780
it'll be bipartisan a nature so few
things in this city have been since we

23
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,180
arrived in January we can't seem to get
many Democrats at the table for big

24
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,509
meaningful initiatives and that's very
disappointing can't have a conversation

25
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,200
let alone a vote on certain things but
we hope when it comes to relief that the

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,090
plan will include Democrats and
Republicans voting to get that relief it

27
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,040
should also really focus on the task at
hand which is about Harvey and those in

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,050
the affected areas so Congress comes
back in the meantime the president has

29
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,770
provided the administration frankly is
working to coordinate with

30
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,740
our local state officials and also the
rest of the administration to access the

31
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,940
resources in the capital that we need to
provide folks with with their immediate

32
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,720
relief so he's going to have to get the
Republicans in line because they're the

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,760
ones that blocked the sandy money last
time Ted Cruz Ryan and others and he's

34
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,960
gonna have to rethink the FEMA money
isn't he I mean making cuts to FEMA and

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,600
allocating money to the wall what's the
main priority Harvey or the wall well

36
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,720
Chris that's not very fair and I heard
you three times in a row get the same

37
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,500
sound bite out so let me reply in kind
when it came to I can sandy you know no

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,770
that's not fair I answered your question
twice I'll do it a third time but if

39
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,000
you're going to talk about who voted for
and against hurricane sandy you have to

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,170
be fair and reflect the full remarks of
the people who say that they voted

41
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,650
against what they wanted to vote for
hurricane relief but they voted against

42
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,300
what they saw as a pork Laden bill that
includes many other things I saw a

43
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,390
woman's for a car for an Inspector
General another was to revamp some some

44
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,010
building but they this is about getting
money to the people right but that just

45
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,350
wasn't on the president the last two
days was asked in different ways about

46
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,700
money and he has both time said he
thinks it should be separate in other

47
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,390
words he thinks that we really should
focus on the task at hand here and

48
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,430
that's democrats and republicans he said
the right thing i i am in no way

49
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,090
criticizing what the president has said
the right thing i'm not suggesting you

50
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,870
won't i'm suggesting that he's got to
get the GOP in line because those

51
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,430
senators who said it was pork laden like
ted cruz were wrong they were playing

52
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,150
politics and that's why Cruz had to
change his position after getting three

53
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,310
Pinocchio's it wasn't pork Laden almost
all of that money was sandy related

54
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,510
listen to Governor Chris Christie a
Republican as we all know he says they

55
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,900
were playing politics they were cheap
and they were wrong so I'm asking how

56
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,209
does the president avoid that happening
again

57
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,330
so I've answered that I'm writing I
think you're playing politics now with

58
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,320
something like a tragedy and Harvey I
answered your question the money will be

59
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,770
there we hope that Republicans the
Democrats will come together and not

60
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,780
politicize this we see a lot of politics
being played

61
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,860
I think instead of having the same
conversations five different ways over

62
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,920
the course of the first three or four
minutes of this interview you could be

63
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,570
putting up 1-800 numbers or websites or
giving people information about diapers

64
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,740
or pet register Nuvo or meals or water
we could do both so you're not that

65
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,390
actually we are actually we use social
media the people away and put something

66
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:52,060
up you can take two of the seats away
from a panel and put information up in

67
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,350
these acts to the freshly required yeah
it's a fact this president isn't just

68
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,450
saying the right thing he will do the
right thing I'm saying do it Congress

69
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,440
has to come together and we saw the
attention with Sandy and they didn't get

70
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,720
it done Donald Trump then citizen Trump
rightly criticized the Obama

71
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,800
administration and Congress for not
getting the money done for Sandy because

72
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,950
they played politics that's what I'm
saying we don't have to be defensive

73
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,340
about the president I'm not calling him
out but I'm saying how does he control

74
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,240
the defensive at all except for the
people in need so my focus is on them

75
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,800
and that's my logic is on the people who
are affected now that's right not not

76
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,940
something you want to politicize from
five years ago my height my concern are

77
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:40,090
the the women and the children and the
family and the destroyed homework people

78
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,990
who stand or in a very different
situation than they were just a wee bit

79
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,620
that's why Chris Christie we're here to
help them and that's why Chris Christie

80
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,000
is making the rounds on television
saying in full-throated fashion don't do

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,870
it again
you took 60 something days to approve

82
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,229
the money because you played politics
and you wanted budget set offs and it

83
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:03,490
wasn't a clean bill avoid those problems
this time that's all I'm saying that's

84
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,750
not disrespecting the survivors that is
respecting the survivors and making sure

85
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,200
that they don't get caught up in
political mishegoss like happened the

86
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,580
last time that's my point

87
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,199
we agree shocking all right let's move
on to something else

88
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,090
the one of the themes that's coming out
of this and it's not a discussion just

89
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,710
to have now but certainly in the weeks
and months as we move forward is whether

90
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,060
or not what happened in Harvey and why
it's happening and why these storms

91
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,800
happy open up a discussion about the
role of climate changes the president is

92
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,050
the administration open to that
conversation Chris we're trying to help

93
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,710
the people whose lives are literally
underwater and you want to have a

94
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:54,289
conversation about climate change I mean
that is I'm not going to engage in that

95
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:59,690
right now because I work for a president
and a vice president and a country that

96
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:05,449
is very focused on helping the millions
of affected Texans and God forbid

97
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:11,000
Louisiana and if if it ends up
imagine if we can find ways to reduce

98
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,479
the number of these storms imagine if we
could figure out why a hundred year

99
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,349
storm seems to happen every other year
you have all these scientists say

100
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:22,969
climate change is part of the equation
it's a question about whether the

101
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:25,849
administration to open it seems the
answer is no well as soon we'll assume

102
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:28,759
no I didn't say that christen you don't
need to put words in my mouth you

103
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,360
berated me for asking the question and
made it sound as if I weren't caring

104
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,919
about the situation I think the cause of
the storm I'm exposing the irony of the

105
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:41,240
conversation here's video you play
amateur climatologist tonight and I will

106
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,520
play professional helper to those in
need and continue in my job here as

107
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,690
counsel to the President to help listen
to the cabinet members the president the

108
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:55,520
vice president FEMA DHS and others
general Kelly who could not be a better

109
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,870
chief of staff equipped for a matter
like Harvey since he was at DHS and as

110
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,190
accustomed to large-scale operations as
such and and I will and we're going to

111
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,639
talk to the governors of the two state
and the locally elected officials and

112
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,539
the NGOs and non-governmental
organizations of faith-based groups the

113
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:14,810
volunteers on the ground neighbor to
neighbor stranger stranger rescuing each

114
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,849
other I'm going to focus on them for in
the short term perhaps the long term

115
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:24,409
because I literally see people I see
pregnant women and including on your

116
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:27,710
channel who are in need
say they're shivering or their kids are

117
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,530
hungry or they're worried about their
belongings or they have to leave their

118
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,190
pets behind can somebody rescue them or
they haven't heard from an elderly

119
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,599
relative that's what I'm going to do
that's what we're going to do here you

120
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,809
should but it doesn't mean that you do
that to the exclusion of questions of

121
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:45,380
why storms happen at some point that
could be part of the conversation I

122
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,380
asked about it you gave it a talk about
that I'll come back to talk about that

123
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:56,000
right now I know that many houstonians
and and those living in and around that

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,860
city we're either uninsured or
underinsured they're facing a lack of

125
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,839
housing there they're exhausted they're
frustrated they're worried about family

126
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,510
members and friends they have not heard
from they're worried about elderly

127
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:13,040
relatives that they have not seen so
we're going to look at the human factor

128
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,760
for quite a while now now if you want to
talk about issues also in the news we

129
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,200
could talk about oh the president's play
at historic tax reform today in Missouri

130
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,140
route 66 the heart of American
manufacturing and and America's Gateway

131
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,390
to the West at one point where he has
promised to simplify a tax code that we

132
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:38,330
spend billions of billions of hours and
dollars trying to comply with it every

133
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:43,040
year you've got these stupid instruction
page for the simple form is over 200

134
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,500
pages long that's just the instruction
page we have a 94% or so of Americans

135
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,089
and 91% of small business owners either
do fill out that form themselves with

136
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:57,740
software packages or pay someone else to
help them do it we're spending we're

137
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,400
losing millions of jobs it's costing us
millions of jobs trillions of dollars

138
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:07,550
and billions of hours will the tiny one
product benefit the middle class the

139
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:13,730
working class equally as it does the
upper class it is a middle class tax cut

140
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,410
also also we have to go here's what it
means I'm glad you asked this is

141
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,459
basically getting a pay raise for many
middle-class Americans the middle income

142
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:26,600
earners I should say we're reducing
their marginal rate but we're also

143
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,950
reducing the rate on small business
owners and entrepreneurs who already

144
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,220
suffering under the yoke of Obamacare
which of course was one of the biggest

145
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,860
job killers and tax raisers in modern
history in addition to that

146
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,389
regulation they've had to overcome they
they are now taxed in a way that hurts

147
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:47,779
their productivity and their ability to
retrain it attract and retain an

148
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:52,279
American workforce expand their
operations survive and prosper there are

149
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:57,379
four major goals here one is to do
exactly that make our job creators more

150
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:02,930
competitive around the globe you know
other countries saw how lower corporate

151
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,649
tax rate was and how well we were doing
for years and they wised up to that and

152
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:09,680
they went lowered their corporate tax
rate and we increased ours these are the

153
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,399
folks who are creating jobs who are
reinvesting with you know the corporate

154
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,250
tax rate is different than when we're
dealing with the working class that's

155
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,120
one point you might reduce their tax
excuse me smarts owners know small

156
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,769
business owners though are the Forgotten
men have forgotten woman absolutely what

157
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:28,430
what they can do I was a small business
owner for 21 years before I took this

158
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,519
job Chris what I would have done with
that kind of reduction in rate you

159
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,449
reinvested right back into the company
you hire another person or two you buy

160
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:40,670
better supplies in inventory you you you
move to a better a better facility

161
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,790
there's no question you can incentivize
them I'm just saying that the corporate

162
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,730
tax rates small business but owners
don't pay that right if they're in an

163
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,899
LLC or an S corp or pass-through they're
filing as individuals so the more you

164
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:54,649
can do for their individual rate the
better I'm saying the corporate rate you

165
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:58,370
know what it is nominally versus what it
is effectively is a big difference if

166
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,120
you get rid of all the loopholes then
you can play with the rate but until you

167
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,569
do that you're doing nothing that's
right thank you for mentioning that part

168
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:10,699
of the simplification is going from this
thousands of pages of nonsense and

169
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:14,779
complying since the IRS is probably one
of the biggest Loch Ness monsters here

170
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:19,220
in the swamp is getting the IRS off the
yolks of many American taxpayers because

171
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,959
they are they live in fear of of not
complying properly so they spent all

172
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:26,809
this money all this time doing that
simplifying awesome means getting rid of

173
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:30,860
these loopholes and these stops to
special interests and swamp dwellers

174
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,750
because frankly Curt the current tax
code benefits many of the wealthy

175
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:41,089
because they can afford attorneys and
accountants and lobbyists to help them

176
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:46,309
pay next to nothing or not your taxes so
let's get rid of a lot of those those

177
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:50,600
loopholes and a lot of those special
interest stops if you will the other

178
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,810
thing that we're going to do is
our country more competitive and also

179
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:00,310
repatriate so many of these funds we've
got so much wealth parked in other

180
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,150
countries because we have made it
prohibitive and companies are doing that

181
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,560
legally we've made a prohibitive for
them to retain and reinvest their

182
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,390
profits and their money into our own
country we want to bring back jobs we

183
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,900
want an including manufacturing jobs and
we want to bring back that wealth that's

184
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,070
been parked in other countries you do
that here and you couple that with what

185
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,760
the president has already done Chris
with respect to deregulation what he

186
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,600
started in in unleashing energy the
investments that he's making an

187
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,180
infrastructure wants to make an
infrastructure another I would hope

188
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:36,010
nonpartisan or bipartisan issue we'll
see and then we're talking you've got

189
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,430
the president today Missouri you've got
vice president pence tonight in West

190
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,150
Virginia at the Chamber of Commerce
where he is be joined by Democratic

191
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:47,500
Senator Joe Manchin we hope he have his
vote he's joined by the new Republican

192
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,930
governor governor justice of western
abortion it's an important discussion

193
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,930
for both sides we know that right now
we're in the phase of the president

194
00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:00,250
wanting to frame the debate and that the
how we'll come later and we'll assess it

195
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,900
when it does let me ask you about a
couple other things one what is going to

196
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,130
happen with daca and we know we're
waiting on that and I ask you in a

197
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:13,000
different context than normal one of the
things we're seeing coming out of Harvey

198
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,930
is they are not checking for
documentation right now because the

199
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,960
exigency is on safety and just making
sure as many people get as helped as

200
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:27,670
possible we have not heard the president
criticize that move that leniency right

201
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,140
now and I'm wondering if that plays in
to any of his philosophy about what to

202
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:37,240
do with daca because these kids who then
become adults in this country are very

203
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,020
vulnerable group what's the thinking on
it well a few things on daca the

204
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:46,540
Congress had all year to act a
legislative fix or some clarity would be

205
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:52,470
helpful but on the matter of daca the
president has expressed sympathy for

206
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:58,630
many of the so-called dreamers but they
refer to themselves as dreamers and the

207
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,680
A's also made very clear that he wants
an immigration system that respects the

208
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,490
law and that is fair fair to everyone
involved and

209
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,510
let me just back up because I think that
Donald Trump as a candidate and now as

210
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,800
president took issues that really were
mired in the low single digits and

211
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,040
everybody's polling illegal immigration
trade for example and he he talks about

212
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,940
them through the lens of fairness but
fairness to also four years the big

213
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,440
debate was what's fair to the illegal
immigrant what more can we do for them

214
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,100
or give to them and Donald Trump said as
a candidate well but what's fair to the

215
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,330
American worker with whom they're
competing on for that particular job

216
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:42,700
what the data disputes that premise by
the way Chris come on we're just not the

217
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,709
jobs not the jobs that Americans are
looking for and doing that's not what

218
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:51,910
undocumented people we by the way that
is a very elite effete argument what is

219
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,020
it how many people do you know that want
jobs picking vegetables Marlena by the

220
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,920
way many cuz I grew up in the circus New
Jersey excuse me I grew up in the party

221
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,060
need you walked right into that because
I actually walked up in the part of New

222
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,300
Jersey that gives it the nickname the
Garden State and worked on a farm myself

223
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:13,149
for eight summers there are many
Americans who will do what immigrants

224
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:18,040
and and american-born citizens have done
for years those aren't the jobs they

225
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,550
have to do what you have to do to
support themselves and their families

226
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:25,510
but documented immigrants aren't what's
keeping wages down they're not what's

227
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,720
taking the good jobs away from American
workers there's a reason that mar-a-lago

228
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,200
has to go outside the country to get
service workers you know there's a

229
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,000
demand for that kind of labor right or
wrong it's existed for a long time so

230
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,770
the question becomes how do you balance
respect for the law and enforcement of

231
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,010
that law and you have two very different
opinions you had Trump during the

232
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,920
campaign who said we're gonna be a
hammer we're gonna be a hammer we're

233
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,730
gonna get them all out then once he
learned more about these people and how

234
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,810
they manifest themselves in this country
especially the dreamers he said this is

235
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:00,040
really hard I got to figure it out they
should rest easy and I'm wondering where

236
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,940
his head is now well that's what leaders
do the leaders listen to many different

237
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,359
insights and inputs and contrasting
opinions the president surrounds himself

238
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,639
with people of that of that nature but
at the same time I want to remind you he

239
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,990
has never backed down from the fact that
this is a country it's a nation it's a

240
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,250
sovereign nation that must have borders
that are we

241
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:26,160
expected and that we have spent billions
of dollars over the years helping other

242
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,420
nations protect their own borders and
many Americans agree with him that it's

243
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,470
high time we respect our own I would
mention a couple other things so this

244
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,600
president is very committed to workforce
development and labor overall he is

245
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,350
about two months ago invested 100
million dollars and directed his

246
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:47,490
Secretary of Labor and others and is
working with governors i sat in one

247
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,670
meeting with Democratic and Republican
governors and members of the cabinet

248
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,230
where they talked about workforce
development of the needs the job

249
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,520
creators came here to what are the needs
of our modern economy what is it that we

250
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,690
what are the skill sets and the tools
that are necessary and and we're

251
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,620
listening to that and he's this
apprenticeship program that he has put

252
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,060
his full force in effect behind as has
Ivanka Trump in her capacity here a

253
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,320
senior advisor it's incredibly
heartening because the folks that you

254
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,990
grow I think they throw some of the
folks you grew up with in Queens I grew

255
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,200
up with in South Jersey these are folks
who don't go to college but who can

256
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,770
graduate from high school or a community
college with a skills certificate and

257
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:30,120
they can become carpenters welders
plumbers they're a very vital important

258
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,000
part of our economy pres and they can
support themselves and their families on

259
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,150
day one the trades the trades are real
there's no question about it they need

260
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,140
encouragement just the way College does
and it also makes the point about what

261
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,130
kinds of jobs are really needed and what
the real threat of these new immigrants

262
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:49,230
are we're at a time Kellyanne I
appreciate the conversation thank you so

263
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,710
is the sequel for you and me thanks
Chris good to know you're always welcome

264
00:18:52,710 --> 00:00:00,000
here to talk about what matters be well
and stay safe
