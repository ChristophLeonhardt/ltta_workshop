00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get on and</font>

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,820
show you all my manfrotto monopod I have

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,139
used this monopod for two and a half

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now this was my first monopod</font>

5
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,410
purchase I now also have a the vo

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">Vanguard monopod which I am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> currently</font>

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,939
using to fill in this video one thing

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,410
about this monopod is pretty cool is

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,859
that it feels sturdy it feels sturdy it

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,009
feels strong just like the typical

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,890
tripods that you get from manfrotto I've

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,630
had this now for two and a half<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,230
and dropped it many times thought I

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,719
busted it that being said because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of its</font>

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,850
sturdiness and its durability it is

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,160
quite heavy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's four point three pounds</font>

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,739
it is quite long as well so you know

18
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,390
so it's some things to consider with

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,220
this monopod the head is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also quite</font>

20
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,200
large as well I currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> shoot all of</font>

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,709
my videos oh my sony nex-5 p I traded<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

22
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,240
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Canon and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a mirrorless camera</font>

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,400
because i knew i was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start</font>

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,990
vlogging more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing more videos and</font>

25
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,340
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that traveled</font>

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,320
light that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was more compact but still</font>

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,200
gave me decent picture quality so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,290
moved to the Sony NEX VI 5t but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

29
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,780
when I had my canon this could still

30
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,720
support it this<font color="#E5E5E5"> could still hold it this</font>

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,540
has a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> intense this allows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

32
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,170
pretty intense wait to be on the head

33
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,210
and support so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know mine I remember</font>

34
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,310
I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily put my canon with a</font>

35
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,950
telephoto lens with my h4n zoom on top

36
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,940
and it was fine three<font color="#CCCCCC"> different latches</font>

37
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,560
to make it as tall as you want one thing

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this monopod is it goes pretty</font>

39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,009
tall<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm stretching out my hand and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

40
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,289
barely touching the tip of it and I'm

41
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,619
five foot one and my arm is long the

42
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:05,520
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really cool about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,639
monopod is how it balances so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

44
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,050
three little feet on the bottom which

45
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,090
let it bounce hands-free which is really

46
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,990
cool so

47
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,520
the thing that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to remember</font>

48
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,410
though with this monopod is opposed to

49
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,120
the vo van garden monopod which is a

50
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,440
monopod i'm currently using<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shoot</font>

51
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,940
this video on is that this monopod will

52
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,890
give you a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> range of motion and</font>

53
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:37,240
to tilt a lot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get that kind</font>

54
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,250
of Dutch angle stuff you can be pretty

55
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,960
fluid and you know getting some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,370
dynamic interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> shot right the thing</font>

57
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,570
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to keep in mind though</font>

58
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,720
with doing that is that this monopod

59
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,480
will not come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to equilibrium like</font>

60
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,840
if I let<font color="#CCCCCC"> go right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

61
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,940
fall so if you're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of person</font>

62
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,180
that wants this type of monopods purely

63
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,850
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that it's low-key you don't</font>

64
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,110
have to worry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> so many sticks and</font>

65
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,810
you can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of walk away from it you</font>

66
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,180
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember to bring it back to the</font>

67
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">equilibrium and make sure that it's set</font>

68
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">good that's the one thing about this</font>

69
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,530
monopod that's just something to keep in

70
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,050
mind i've had a few close encounters

71
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,470
with this monopod and walking away but

72
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,090
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> having it set back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the center</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

73
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,770
you know having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to catch the camera</font>

74
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,160
quickly very<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary stuff so keep that in</font>

75
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,920
mind with your manfrotto monopod or be

76
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,110
smart and just don't walk away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

77
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,960
equipment like I do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can purchase it</font>

78
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,720
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon it does come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> head</font>

79
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,510
it comes as a full unit with the head

80
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,510
included and once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love it it's a</font>

81
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,140
great reliable monopod only thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

82
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,570
it is because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its durability because</font>

83
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,910
of its range of motion it is a little

84
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,590
bit heavier and it costs a little more

85
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,290
it really depends you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I</font>

86
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,400
say a lot is<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy equipment that enhances</font>

87
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,610
your abilities you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I switched to</font>

88
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,950
monopods from tripods because having a

89
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,060
super stable locked shot wasn't that

90
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,459
crucial for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a vlogger and a</font>

91
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,640
youtuber when I work professionally with

92
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,920
big picture lab that's when i<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a</font>

93
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,920
tripod but it didn't it didn't make

94
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,110
sense to invest the money in an intense

95
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,520
tripod because that's not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of</font>

96
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,240
stuff I shoot so investing in these

97
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,580
monopods was a really good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me</font>

98
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,150
because they are simple and light and

99
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,919
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause as much attention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

100
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,370
themselves as traditional bigger more

101
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,430
expensive tripods so consider what

102
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,600
you're trying to shoot and what your

103
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,780
goal is as a shooter and try to find

104
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">equipment that helps with that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

105
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,380
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to spend an arm and a leg</font>

106
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get you know something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks</font>

107
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,710
decent and that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be proud</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

108
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,950
know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to have the</font>

109
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,800
obscenely expensive thing to tell a

110
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,710
great story so with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that being said</font>

111
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,100
this is the monopod I hope you enjoy

112
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,870
this video if you have the manfrotto

113
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,729
monopod and you like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

114
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:24,010
recommend another maybe more affordable

115
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,260
monopod to

116
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,390
anyone go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and leave it in the</font>
