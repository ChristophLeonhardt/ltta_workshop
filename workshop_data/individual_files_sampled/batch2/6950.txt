young turks now has audio the TYT audio network podcast of some of your favorite shows and new shows including one with Nina Turner former Ohio State Senator she's gonna do we the people with Nina Turner talking about equality and justice and seeing that through the eyes of regular Americans who are affected by politics and policy everybody check it out at TYT dot-com / audio the latest assaults against the Affordable Care Act has begun a previously under Donald Trump they eliminated the individual mandate which I know was a was a controversial portion of the law but it also its removal will in the end raise prices for people who remain on those plans they've also allowed plans that don't cover essential benefits to be sold so now many people will be buying health insurance that will leave them vulnerable to both medical and economic emergencies later on when they actually need the health insurance they think they have and now it's about to get a whole lot broader and enter into areas that we thought we did not have to worry about in a brief filed in a Texas federal court and an accompanying letter to the House and Senate leaders of both parties the Justice Department agrees in large part with twenty republican-led states that have brought a suit against the ACA they contend that the ACA provision requiring most Americans to carry health insurance soon will no longer be constitutional and we know that and as a result consumer insurance protections under the law will not be valid either the three-page letter from attorney general Jeff Sessions begin by saying that Justice adopted its position with the approval of the President of the United States and I've looked into it this is literally only thing Jeff Sessions is doing that Trump approves up these days yeah but there was a reference there to consumer protections so what does it actually mean the most important thing that we're talking about here are the protections for people with pre-existing conditions now if you go back more than a decade to before the ACA if you had a pre-existing condition which we know a huge percentage of Americans do we're gonna break down some of the numbers later on you could lose your health insurance you could be denied access to it or if something happened to you and you had health insurance they would deploy their detectives to go through your history identify that you should have known or reported that you had this and then your plan would be revoked at that point one of the things that the ACA did that is good and both sort of universally accepted 70% of those polled back in June of 2017 supported the protection for people with pre-existing conditions that was brought on under the ACA now the Trump administration is saying they are not going to fit to defend the ACA including assaults against that exemption so in the near future potentially we could lose that that protection so like the lawsuit argues that without the financial penalty for not having insurance that the law is unconstitutional which was like the lead legal logic that John Roberts Chief Justice John Roberts used in his argument when he upheld the individual mandate but the GOP tax bill repealed that aspect of it so they're essentially playing the dirty games that they always do they're using their or the things that they have already done as a reason to screw over Americans as they tend to do and what's incredible is how brazen they are in you know taking away these protections but also just rejecting you know historically rejecting portions of the Affordable Care Act that would offer them federal money to expand their state Medicaid programs and offer coverage for the most impoverished people in the country the most disadvantaged people in the country so I mean this should be unsurprising for anyone who's been paying attention and who has noticed that they are willing to go against the best interests of their constituents just to be greedy or make a political point but you know this I think could have some severe ramifications for them politically because people are going to feel the impact of this unless they are successful in in spinning it which Republicans are very successful in spinning things they can make it seem as though oh no this is a failure of Obamacare that you know it's just it's now are you really affecting you it has nothing to do with us and you really need Democrats to fight back right so I think that there's messaging thing but if they are successful in this and keep in mind the federal judges do need to make a decision on this but it is likely that this Republican appointed judge is very likely to vote in favor of what the Republicans want in in the suit we'll see how it all plays out but we really need fighters in Congress right now we need Democrats to come forward and make it abundantly clear what's going on and how they're planning on stripping these protections away from Americans who desperately need it and I think we also need to call out the fact that it's not an economically intelligent decision right which might not also be surprising but but the reality is the the math between having a mandate and actually having coverage over pre-existing conditions almost cancels each other out and so you can actually have both done which if we're to go Care Act was was meant to do and and not really miss a beat it's you're dialing back the entire economics of how insurance companies work the whole benefit of having a larger pool of people paying into other people who are coming into the pool ultimately and the Republicans don't even understand this that's actually good for insurance companies they get to have bigger pools so in effect they are both screwing the public and screwing the insurance companies which which is a bizarre balancing I mean the first time this policy was implemented was in the state of Massachusetts under Mitt Romney Mitt Romney is a Republican we all know this so this was not some crazy socialist progressive plan it was actually quite the opposite and I think that there there needed to be a better a better way to explain why the mandate took place or or was implemented in the first place because I don't think most people understood what it was it was painted as government overreach and nothing more than that but in reality yes that is that is what helped fund this program I wish we didn't have the Affordable Care Act I wish we had universal health care and something that made a lot more sense than what we currently have but now we might not even have the protections under the Affordable Care Act and not the devastating just to piggyback on top of what you said about this being not economically viable this throws the markets into even more disarray than it did when there was a legislative battle over the Affordable Care Act just a few months back because a legal case could take who knows how long and so insurance companies are actually pretty angry that these Republican states are going forward with this and that the the Justice Department is backing those 20 states right and also to what you just said really quick the reality it is if you're not having enough money coming into the insurance system which is not a good shits and we should have a universal system we should not have private insurers who actually are the ones deciding what treatments are given to individual people and so forth but but it also means that it opens the door to reducing benefits even further and so what people think they have whether they are doing it under the Affordable Care Act or under their own private insurance policies they will find themselves with less insurance and they are paying for they think they're paying for and this is definitely indication that there there is nothing that is not on the table in terms of being snatched away I mean this is the most universally popular part of this both for Americans at large and Republicans if you if you weren't around before the ACA it was rough rough times if you were not some perfect like like oh come strut like perfect physical strength if you had any sorts of problems you were probably gonna have financial problems as well and they are ready to bring us back there I know some people see any sort of strike against the ACA as like like if if like us you want universal health care you say well what's the difference we want to get to universal health care but the thing is we don't immediately get to that and along the way a lot of people theoretically could end up bankrupt or chronically ill or dead as a result of changes like this and some people are in a safe enough or healthy enough position that they can look on this and just say it'll be fine we'll push past it a few years but there's gonna be a lot of people left behind along the way really fast before you get to that I do want I want to go back to that last graphic graphic 21 just to show you again 59% of Republicans support these protections and I want to focus I mean that represents millions and millions and millions of Republicans I want to focus on one because there is one prominent Republican who also supported these protections his name is Donald Trump and we want to show you some of the promises that he made over the past few years in relation to the specific part of the the law are you going to make sure that people with preconditions are still coming yes because it happens to be one of the strongest assets we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage look let me just tell you pre-existing conditions are in the bill and I just watched another network than yours and they were saying pre-existing is not covered pre-existing conditions are in the bill and I mandate it I said has to be this notion of pre-existing conditions is obviously of tremendous concern existing conditions it's it is it okay then to pass a House bill that may not protect pre-existing conditions because of a state's law we are protecting pre-existing conditions and it'll be every good bit as good on pre-existing conditions as Obamacare so look his ideology at the best of times is a jumble of like indecipherable complexity he doesn't even understand it but on this he was very clear over and over and over and the reason he was that clear is because this is an incredibly popular part of the law so now it is clear Donald Trump lied to you because it's not like the GOP in the house gave him a bill that stripped it out and he's got a sign it this is his approval to the Justice Department this is on him specifically and so if you're a trump supporter he lied to you over and over and over and if you were one of the let's bring this up one of the 27% of non-elderly adults who have pre-existing conditions representing somewhere on bad at math somewhere between fifty and a hundred million americans theoretically could have pre-existing conditions at some point in their life who could now be thrown off of their health insurance he lied to you and if you are not a trump supporter please share this portion of the video with them it might get through to them that he does not have their best interests at heart and just really quickly these Republicans are supposed to be rule of law right they are literally violating the rule of law here the law set is very clear and the highest court in the land ruled on it and they're trying to chip away at it one at a time rule of law is only when they're trying to incarcerate more and more black people for drug offenses or support cops that shoot that when they're unarmed but one thing that I wanted to add because it is a big story that keeps coming up over and over again because of gun violence the country let's just point for the record and and just finalize this they are disingenuous when it comes to mental health issues mental health issues are only used as scapegoats as a scapegoat when there's mass violence or mass shootings and they do not want to talk about gun control they do not care about your mental health care they never have they never will if they genuinely cared they wouldn't fight so aggressively to gut the only protections that we have that offer some coverage for those who suffer from mental health issues and by the way the number of people who are now you know taking their own lives is is increasing considerably we're going to talk about that later on in the show and to know that this is all going on and that they use it as a political talking point when it's convenient for them is just disgusting two easy ways to follow the young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT

shows including one with Nina Turner former Ohio State Senator she's gonna do we the people with Nina Turner talking about equality and justice and seeing that through the eyes of regular Americans who are affected by politics and policy everybody check it out at TYT dot-com / audio Donald Trump is off overseas at the g7 and our allies are doing what they can to diffuse this brewing trade war that he's gotten us into um just to be clear when I say our allies I mean most of our allies that his allies since he doesn't seem to like most of them very much in advance of the g7 he tweeted this looking forward to straightening out unfair trade deals with the g7 countries if it doesn't happen we come out even better without work if that's the case then why are you doing it you nincompoop but that's what he's going to say of course and he goes there and he punches him a crown on the face and he punches Merkel in the face and all of that there are people there though that he does like we're people he'd like to be there so why don't we turn to one of his first requests of the g7 which you'll see here we have a world to run out of the g7 which used to be the g8 they through Russia out they should let Russia come back in because we should have Russia at the negotiating table some might argue that they're already well represented there but look he would like to make it the g8 once again I would like to just fill out the history of this if you're not familiar with how the numbers got moved around Russia joined the group in the 1990s after emerging from the wreckage of the Soviet Union making it the g8 but it's armed intervention and neighboring Ukraine in 2014 and seizure of the Crimean Peninsula anger and other major powers the remaining members led by President Barack Obama expelled it in a sign of global resolve not to let international borders be redrawn by force mr. Trump offered no specific reasoning for why Russia should be let back in even though it retains control of Crimea and has not adhered to an international agreement to end its intervention in eastern Ukraine so so there's more to what he's doing at the g7 but his first big request is to expand its roster slightly so I just wanted to add a little more context and this is actually news that we talked about on yesterday's show so Putin was recently addressing the people of Russia and he also was essentially addressing other countries internationally for being allies of the United States and so he essentially poked fun or taunted US allies for doing business with the United States and said something along the lines of what did I tell you you do business with the United States what are you gonna get you get these tariffs which he likened to sanctions so he's been criticizing the United States pretty aggressively and it's it to me what it does is it it messages that Trump is the perfect candidate or the perfect president I should say for someone like Putin who really wants to dominate the world stage and wants to kind of get the upper hand over the United States right it's pretty easy to get the upper hand over Donald Trump exactly right and now we have Trump saying like you know rushar should be at the table I don't know why he adds an are at the end of Russia well first of all we have imposed sanctions we are currently in a policy of sanctions by his own administration by his own Treasury secretary who announces back in April we have expanded our sanctions against Russia so he didn't get that memo okay if you don't read it whatever I just want to just go back to the fact that he was concerned about deals with with the g7 countries because that implies to me that he do not realize that we are technically one of the seven countries in the g7 that's just a math thing but there's actually a g6 if he's being accurate about the countries with which he is invoking trade wars which is all of them the ministers of finance the Treasury secretaries and so forth from the g7 met before this meeting this is the leaders before that the the financial leaders met and and six out of seven of them the seventh being us basically were opposed to all of the trade wars that Trump has started that they have retaliated against and that will continue to spiral upward every single one of them declared in some manner that it feels like the 6+1 mm-hmm yeah yeah I want to talk more about the the odd relationship between US and our allies versus Trump and those who are not our natural allies but John McCain actually put out a statement about this announcement that Trump it out and it talks a little bit about that so I want to read an excerpt from his press release John McCain said Vladimir Putin chose to make Russia unworthy of membership in the g8 by invading Ukraine and annexing Crimea nothing he has done since then has changed that most obvious fact every day Russian LED separatist forces are killing Ukrainians in the dawn bus every day Putin's forces are helping the Assad regime's slaughter the Syrian people and every day through assassinations cyberattacks and malign influence Russia's assaulting democratic institutions all around all over the world the president has inexplicably shown our adversaries the deference and esteem that should be reserved for our closest allies those nations that share our values and have sacrificed alongside us for decades are being treated with contempt I mean it is interesting we're really fast it's interesting that like in his really in his talks with Trudeau recently or McCrone or Merkel he doesn't seem to have liked even as much as he'd like them like these people who are natural allies naturally he goes after any attacks the people who are authoritarian leaders around the world as Bernie Sanders pointed out recently he just feels this natural kinship for and you might say well they're flattering him but the thing is as an appointed out I mean Russia was recently sort of taunting Trump over his trade problems with his allies and that leads to him wanting them to join the g8 at the g7 to make at the g8 but when he just had a contentious talk with McCrone over trade he got pissed at him when he talked with Trudeau and he didn't like the criticism he got pissed at him so why is it that with our allies when they criticism he reacts negatively but when it's authoritarian rulers he's fine with it maybe he just has some sort of affection for them but III think that there might be more at play his and also considering the fact that he's in the middle of this investigation which he can't stop himself from tweeting about it's probably not a great ideas Emma said during the break it's not a good idea for you two out of nowhere mention that Russia should be involved you know in this group of allies that it should be the the g8 again it's kind of insane he doesn't really have the mental block - no wheat there in the new cycle they're talking about how I'm in Putin's back pocket maybe I shouldn't out of nowhere unprompted with no policy position behind it say that Russia should be back into the g8 make it the g8 again but just a side note about John McCain I wish that he would hold the United States the same standard that he holds other countries - he's not making the same argument that the United States should be expelled from this from the g7 because we are currently helping the Saudi blockade in Yemen etc so I just want to take John McCain's comments with a grain of salt because often it's just ramping up us up towards more more and more aggression etc and he often doesn't have policy behind it he likes to criticize Donald Trump in public and then vote for him in private so it's just back to the g8 and the whole Russia versus the g6 there the rest of our allies I mean you know the interior to your question maybe into your question you know maybe the fact is that we actually have trade agreements with all of these nations in addition to being part of the full g7 bloc we actually have sanctions against Russia that's right oh it's it's it's a very bizarre sort of anti Machiavellian ah it's very strange and also I mean if you had a reason if he could actually point to how this would benefit the American people then okay but these you know the way that we're treating our allies and and the tariffs on aluminum and steel are actually going to negatively impact employers more importantly employees and consumers in the United States so I don't understand why he's doing this with again our longest-serving allies it just doesn't make any sense at all yeah yeah yeah even if you're not remotely interested in the the Russia angle of this and you think that countries that invade and seize territory should be allowed in with that no conditions on them remember that we're talking about him going there punching our allies in the face and we are going to lose hundreds of thousands if not potentially millions of jobs as a result of it what what is it a good idea to get involved in a trade war with Europe what president would think that except for Trump right well the last time that happened we had a great depression throughout the world the last time we had an isolationist policy was in the 1920s in the way World War 1 and that ultimately unleashed a global depression and world war 2 I'm sure that's what happened daddy's a well-versed historian the best historian and he can count two easy ways for Young Turks

audio network podcast of some of your favorite shows and new shows including one with Nina Turner former Ohio State Senator she's gonna do we the people with Nina Turner talking about equality and justice and seeing that through the eyes of regular Americans who are affected by politics and policy everybody check it out at TYT dot-com / audio Donald Trump's conspiracy theories are now determining US policy in a number of different areas ranging from climate change to asbestos in his 1997 book the art of the comeback Trump argued that the association of the chemical with health risks was part of a mob created conspiracy he said I believe that the movement against asbestos was led by the mob because it was often mob related companies that would do the asbestos removal great pressure was put on politicians and as usual the politicians relented he by the way has also said that it is a 100% safe asbestos you shouldn't worry about it and so that was just his belief though what do we care about that well now we know that the EPA is not going to consider the health risks and impact of asbestos already in the environment when evaluating the dangers associated with the chemical compound according to Scott Pruett that was announced last week just revealed a day or two ago that means asbestos used in tiles piping and adhesives throughout homes and businesses in the United States will remain largely unchecked and unaccounted for which again you don't have to worry about because it is 100% safe as Trump said which will be news to the nearly 15,000 Americans who die each year from asbestos related diseases and because he's a chemist he's the chemist as well an amateur chemist that's right yeah so well is it safe I would like to use a bestest you know written materials in any dwelling that Trump ever existed why don't we you know change the piping and the tile it's just a renovation he likes the taste this is so we knew at least at the young turks we knew that the Trump administration would be terrible but it's kind of amazing how many things come up that we didn't and see coming like terrible you know just terrible actions by the EPA that we didn't even consider like asbestos is it's just it's been widely known for a while now to cause serious health issues respiratory issues which is why you know you see those commercials on every television show you know featuring lawyers who wanna do business or help people who have suffered from this and to know that we're gonna go back in time on this issue something this ridiculous is is devastating and it's gonna continue happening things that when you least expect are gonna now you know lack oversight by the EPA the very government organization that's supposed to protect us right and also the fact that these people these 15,000 Americans that the die each year from asbestos related poisoning are probably Republicans and Democrats this this is not the this is this is not something that just applies to one group of the voter base minutes is something that applies to to whoever has been contaminated and he isn't a chemist and Scott Pruett who is still trying to well spent a hundred twenty thousand dollars of our money to go to Italy and like camp out at the Vatican right you know shouldn't be the person first of all running the EPA but also not protecting us forgetting on protecting the EPA which he doesn't do very well but but not protecting all kinds of Americans well this is the same EPA that says the clean air and water act right now the Clean Air Act and clean water acts are fine have you seen Flint Michigan I don't know they still don't have clean water there have you seen what's happening in Chicago where they found let in the water and let is just the beginning of what's wrong with our water and our air I mean the respiratory problems from asbestos aren't the only reason I can't say the word can you help me that's the effect of asbestos on your body yeah yeah respiratory yeah and and it is going to get worse thanks to this to put in perspective by the way 15,000 Americans that die every year that is a roughly five 911s every single year hell it's even three hurricane Maria's in Puerto Rico every single year we're just going to continuing we're not gonna do anything about it because we don't want the mob to benefit too much I hope that this isn't just his he's conspiratorial thinking that he gets an idea in his head and he doesn't actually look for data in regard to it I hope that it is simply that he built shoddy real estate and he didn't want to do what is necessary to clean out asbestos don't trust a real-estate guy something that's all up in there real estate but look Linda Weinstein who lost her husband to this this chemical is head of the press president the asbestos disease awareness organization and responded to this news saying if you don't evaluate the dangerous legacy of asbestos you don't know how much contamination still exists in the United States we know it's in our homes schools workplace and environment but the average American can't identify and evaluate the risk we've taken risk evaluation off the table and I will say this we have been covering constantly the environmental regulations that have been being reversed under Donald Trump and that might sound bad but there is a silver lining because I had not actually known how many good moves Obama made on the environment they've all been reversed now but he apparently actually did quite a bit throughout the course as presidency he did he was terrible at taking credit for those things or at least again it goes back to the failure of democratic messaging right where when they're actually right on something or when they actually accomplish something they somehow allow Republicans to take control of the narrative and dictate whether or not it's a good thing or bad you of course when Democrats accomplished something Republicans will market it as something that's terrible and Democrats don't fight back so you're right there were so many environmental policies under the Obama administration that I was completely unaware of and he never talked about those things it was by design because he was afraid to be called anti industry and anti capitalist so he did everything that he did that was really good was usually behind the scenes because it's the Democratic Party operates out of fear oftentimes and that's what's unfortunate about what he did because if he was more public about it and controlled the messaging like Ana just said a majority of the American people don't want asbestos in their air and they want the environment to be they want to be able to turn on their tap and know that the water that's coming out is healthy for them so if he was able to control that then then Trump wouldn't be able to be so easily do what he's doing now and wouldn't put such an awful individual the worst cabinet member like scott brewing in the epa I wonder if exposure to asbestos counts as a pre-existing condition that I love that you mentioned that because everything you know comes together you know they're gutting the Affordable Care Act they're you know you have 20 republican-led states that are fighting tooth and nail to do away with protections that would prevent insurance companies from dropping you from their programs or their coverage so I have an example though of those protections that are being taken away and actually another one of the moves that Obama made that I had not actually known about this is the process of being immersed under a law passed by Congress during the final year of the Obama administration the EPA was required for the first time to evaluate hundreds of potentially toxic chemicals and determine if they should face new restrictions or even be removed from the market that was the plan as it moves forward reviewing the first batch of ten chemicals the EPA has in most cases decided to exclude from its calculations any potential exposure caused by the substances presence in the air the ground or the water I mean how would a chemical get into any of those the agency will focus on possible harm caused by direct contact with a chemical in the work place or elsewhere so let's give you an example of one of those under the approach the EPA will examine what harm can be caused to anyone directly exposed to perchloroethylene a dry cleaning solvent and metal degreaser designated by the EPA as a likely carcinogen during manufacturing or when using in dry cleaning carpet cleaning or handling certain ink removal products but the agency will not focus on exposures that occur from traces of the chemical found in drinking water in 44 states as a result of improper disposal over decades which is certainly nice if you produce that chemical or if you might have to foot the bill for removal of it or filtering of it from our water supply so look it's not to say that they're not going to protect you from the harmful effects of chemicals so long as like in the beginning of a Batman movie you fall over a railing into a big vat of it they will protect you from that sort of contact the genomic the Joker would be covered but if there are chemicals in our water which we know there are any number of them the EPA is not concerned about that and that just again pushes the problem of bad health of bad environmental practices into the future this is it won't change the impact of asbestos it's not going to change the impact of people with pre-existing conditions who might have been exposed to asbestos or whatever the combinations are of coming into the system it increases the cost in the future that that cost could could happen under Trump it could happen under another Republican administration it could happen under Democratic administration so though perhaps things weren't touted sort of under Obama that might have actually been helpful like the Paris Accord more so you know there is opportunity right now to talk about this because again it is a bipartisan issue in terms of the voter and and just to show how far we've come or how much we've regressed the Republican Party the the asbestos was proposed to be banned under Republican President in 1989 and now they're saying go ahead you don't care about those health effects the Republican presen creation and now we have someone that's the head of the EPA who's working to dismantle it every single day and the president who calls it a hundred percent safe applied right yes yes the mobs not safe but asbestos is and yeah just that again it like I hate to you want to beat a dead horse or a dead Trump voter but like you thought that this was the guy that's gonna get in there and look out for you that the the politicians that had been there before weren't and in many ways they weren't but neither is he like did you vote for him so he could go to Washington and stop chemicals from being taken out of our water or keep the asbestos in your home is that what you sent him there to do did he drain the swamp just to found that that all that's left now is dispense and metal degreaser but that's what you get so just the reminder for the next time around two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on YouTube you're notified of our videos you a dreamer who had been in the country since he was three years old had chosen to be deported rather than forced to be deported after he had some minor convictions for misdemeanors involving driving under the influence now unfortunately shortly after he left the country and went back to Mexico he was murdered and some are some believe that he was murdered by cartels because of the drug violence in Mexico Manuel Antonio I know Pacheco was scheduled to graduate from high school last month but died just after being deported by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement so let me just explain how this all happened he had been in the country since he was three years old he had protection as a dreamer however after he was caught Drina I don't know if he was drinking but he was driving under the influence a judge had decided to take that protection away from him and he had an option he could either be forced to leave the country a regular deportation or he could agree on his own to volunteer to leave the country and the reason why he chose that option is because he would have the ability to come back as a visitor in the future now unfortunately again after he left shortly after he was murdered according to reports his throat was slit that was the way that he was murdered he had a one-year-old child here in the United States and apparently he had a full scholarship to a college so he was battling with depression based on what his family is telling reporters his father had been imprisoned for drug use and that kind of led to a downward spiral in his own personal life and unfortunately it ended in a very tragic way so when you say he when it is said in reports that he chose to leave to be deported the choice was between you have to leave and you have to leave but you can come back right so that was not the choice to say you know what it seems like it it's my decision to do that no that was the version of the punishment of you had a DUI you need to go that he chose because obviously he would choose that between that and the alternative but when you bring up depression we're just talking about mental illness a dreamer doesn't get to have depression in the eyes of a conservative media or conservative he doesn't get to write he is a criminal in in he is painted as such and he is treated as such and you need look no further than the brock turner case was his name to get the stanford swimmer right he he was going through some stuff it might have a negative effect on him so we will go easy on him because he's a swimmer from stanford that's that is the disparity that is so clear so prevalent in stories like this and it's utterly unjust i just want to quickly remind people who might have forgotten about that story he was caught raping someone who was unconscious behind a dumpster yeah and the judge was incredibly lenient gave him a six-month sentence three of which he actually served judge got recalled yeah yeah recalled which was some good news this week yeah you know what and to tie those two things in together if you don't think that those local elections matter and when it comes to these cases this kind of stuff these judges the people who are in office that affect you locally that's when you really have to use your power to get those people out just like that judge is gone the the DA in Florida that was associated with the Trayvon Martin case gone because the people in the community chose to go out and vote quite honestly I'm an anchor baby my father is a an immigrant that has been deported three times back to the Dominican Republic he's not in the United States when I think about these stories I can I think about the privilege that I had to be born here because he was only three so it's not like he came here six months ago but the demonization of immigrants I know those Bush girls were drunk and in in doing drugs and alcohol and people you know stigmatize these young people I'm just so tired the war on people who look like me and people who come here to make a difference going on a scholarship to go to college not a gang member not participating in crime here trying to do something give a better life to his own child and just yet you go on Twitter and the justification for this he was a criminal and we want our country back and I'm so tired of hearing people who stole this country saying that this is our country I had it up to here this is white supremacy at its best and white privilege you know that's very obvious I mean he's painted out I mean just recently he called immigrants um 45 called immigrants animals and this if this poor child all of his the only thing he did wrong was to drink under the influence then he gets a criminal record and the option is basically leave or leave and he left and then really we've not really solved any problems because what we really have to play with here is that white supremacy still rules and what if I was still busy coddling every single white supremacist out there while they're busy homegrown mass shooters are killing children in schools and in churches and at the same time we've got all this attention going towards I see and immigrants and I think is it's it's not an alignment with what apparently America is all about and yet it's what we seem to be focused on continuously and again more smoke screens and more smoke screens well forty five gets to do whatever he wants behind in the in the background and busts out with some new policy and and for anyone who thinks okay well he did break the law so that's it he gets to he needs to be deported can you at least acknowledge that those who seek asylum at the border are seeking asylum for legitimate purposes because that violence in their countries which by the way is perpetuated by our policies is real and they're afraid and they want to protect themselves and their families and how do we respond to them we rip their children away from them take their children to detention centers or shelters in different states and then spend US tax dollars to prosecute those very people who are seeking asylum that's that's what's happening in the country right now there was a report right right before we went to air about how immigrants are now being put in federal prisons because these detention centers are too full these private prisons are too full federal prisons are used for the most violent criminals imaginable people who have been convicted of violent crimes and right now we are housing undocumented immigrants there because we don't want to give them asylum we don't want to protect them I mean it's one thing to not want to allow them in the country which I disagree with but why not just send them away why would we need to prosecute them why would we take their children children away and keep them in detention for it who knows how long sometimes it's an indefinite period of time yeah I mean it's it's crazy didn't Coretta Scott King try to warn y'all about Jeff Sessions did she say wasn't it wasn't it her who Coretta Coretta Scott King spoke out about him when she was alive back in the day I have family that's worked in politics in Alabama they knew about you and when he was running that was the name of the black woman that was like do not do not do not you guys got a vote against that make sure and Trump is like that black people let's get him he was the first one to say like Trump seems like a good guy I'm gonna get out in front I'm gonna be the first idiot in line there he was the first and he's the worst the worst went first yeah and I have to be honest I kind of enjoy every time Trump he tears them apart on Twitter even though your tears of apart for all the wrong reasons I do enjoy it because he deserves it yeah he's not a good person I mean look Trump has employed he's filling the swamp I mean like the swamp has not been emptied he has picked the worst of people like Scott Pruett to head the EPA Jeff Sessions to head the Justice Department as Attorney General it just it couldn't get worse and it just feels like he's picking picking members of a fan club you know you like yeah you like me okay yeah sure sure you can come in so yeah it's baseless an elementary school in Massachusetts is getting a quite a bit of attention after parents who were thinking about sending their child there came across a nursery rhyme that would prepare kindergarteners for a potential lockdown in response to a shooter so I'm gonna show you the note that was tweeted by these parents and it went viral now for those of you who might not be able to read it it says lockdown lockdown lock the door shut the lights off say no more go behind the desk and hide wait until it's safe inside lockdown lockdown it's all done now it's time to have some fun so again this was posted in a kindergarten class and I completely understand why the school why the teachers would want to do it this is obviously a serious problem and how do you communicate this problem or how do you prepare kindergarteners for a potential shooter but it does it is a pretty devastating commentary on the state of the country how schools are dealing and coping with a very real problem and by the way the lack of action on a federal level Betsy DeVos is now the head of a commission that is supposed to respond to these mass shootings and when asked by senator patrick leahy will you be looking into the issue of guns she specifically said with a big smile on her face that they will not address guns yeah so they it's it's interesting because this is what nursery rhymes are for mm-hmm traditionally in history ring-around-the-rosie is about the plague it is about how to diagnose the symptoms of the plague ring around the rosey you got red ring pocketful of posies those are the buboes and the bubonic plague ashes ashes we all fall down we die yeah that's it Jack and Jill went and just on their face these nursery rhymes are terrifying Jack and Jill went up the hill to get a pail at what then they fall down the hill and they died like it is weird goodbye baby yes when the bough breaks me and analysis on these nursery was between that Disney made every mother trying to kill a stepmother trying to kill a child and you know dead somebody and yeah did you see that the Beauty and the Beast and it's Pro bestiality message interspecies mating is great you know frozen cocaine's coming out of our hands frozen coke a beautiful you know people I went online and I looked at some of the responses to this you know when I think about it I think about Sandy Hook those little kids did not have access to anything that was preparing them for murder because they did it they were not prepared because they shouldn't have to be but when when I saw all that outrage about these Nursery Rhymes you know what why don't you be outraged about these homegrown terrorists that are the reason why these children while we've had to update the nursery rhymes to address mass shootings which are now a reality that we all have to deal with as a grownup I go into a movie theater I was in the movie theater nervous cuz I thought a guy next to me I was profiling the white dude so imagine a five-year-old not having the basic information about and unfortunately this is how you program children through music you know and how you program them to to learn things that you know you got to get them programmed to understand what they are supposed to do if somebody goes in their classroom with a gun well we all stop we got to stop coddling these murderers it's it's funny because I often times will do like a comparative analysis of how Americans prepare children for you know pretty devastating things adult problems and and difficult concepts concepts of understand and then I think about like how my parents prepared me for things or how Armenian parents traditionally will prepare their parents know know about okay I'll not hate listen people come to school they have gone they tried to kill you I give you gun and you never she never tried to like rhymers do something cutesy with anything is if bully come to you punch him in the face yep you know and it's like it's it's very different and and the thing is the way that I think American culture handles these situations it almost kind of I don't know how to explain it it's whitewashing is not the right term but it makes a very serious issue seem less serious yeah that's what I mean to say so when I grew we both grew up you know Los Angeles area and we had the terrifying experience of an earthquake is the ground which you rely on to be a solid thing just suddenly mmm effing with you shaking all around and so the way they prepared us we had drills of course but they also had the shaky quickie bus which was a hydraulically fitted van that parks at your school and it's room B goes down at time for your shaky squeaky but and Yogi Bear and it the hydraulics shake and this is a five-point earthquake here's a six-point earthquake but what else I mean what else are you supposed to do you're right you're right I true yeah there isn't there isn't really much you can do but this is Donald Trump's America isn't it so that's what we're looking at right now Bobby America yeah yeah yeah it gets worse every year there's no question about that the it happens more often now that we're you know mass shooters no there's nothing nothing's gonna be done about this they have mental health issues themselves which by the way I do believe needs to be addressed but it's not just mental health issues it's also guns I'm sorry I totally interrupted you yeah no no that's fine I'm yeah I think they you know we put it down to mental health issues or just you know if it's the school yes it's you know I want to kill a bunch of kids if it's the church that we're a bunch of you know people of color black people got shot it was racism so and they always put down to mental health when it's a white guy it's mental health right when it's a black guy or a brown guy it's a totally different scene I mean even dancers even down to the way that there is a basically that cop that drove into the guy who is running off the black guy that was running our Georgia yeah that's that's what happened one day before yesterday was something like that and even there you know that was again just profiling this this poor black boy they if it had been a then that white cop would never have got another job if he'd been black mm-hmm so that again look at the situations and how they play out it's just the same yeah he's a nice boy and we knew him when he was a little boy I mean like what does that even mean right you know there's a ton of people I know when they were little and nine of them now it's like I won't have anything to them yeah I do knowing them as lovely new jeffrey dahmer as a kid bundy as a kid and then specifically to the issue of guns in school Nancy DeVos did you see that there was a moment when Nancy DeVos went in a hearing before Senator Leahy and Leahy was like so are you she has a new she has a trump created a task force to study safety in schools and lay he's like so are you gonna study guns as it relates to safety in schools and she just booked she's like oh no we're not go well we'll leave the door open we're not with that bad blah blah won't even commit to studying the effects of guns on school safety by the way that Commission was created immediately after the shooting in parkland Florida oh yeah and so it was created in response to a shooting and they're refusing to even consider the issue of guns and it might have something to do with the fact that Betsy DeVos herself is invested in a company that makes parts for military weaponry ie guns right so manure incorrect about one thing as she was answering she didn't have a serious look on her face she had a smile as she's telling Lahey no we will not be looking at the issue of guns she thinks it's smiling while she's saying something incredibly stupid somehow masks the stupidity of her statement I mean it's it's unbelievable but of course they're not gonna do something about it and it will continue to be an issue we need to get more active politically yeah and and that that is really the only hope that we have please get involved in your local elections be involved in the general election as well but more importantly the primaries matter they matter a lot yeah and and don't leave it to the last minute where you do have an option between the lesser of two evils you
