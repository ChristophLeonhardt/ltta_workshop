00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,969
welcome back we're discussing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

2
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,920
countries you must of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the six countries</font>

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,170
you must pay attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to in the next</font>

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,970
decade last decade it was all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">bricks I'm here with my colleague</font>

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,170
Vincent Fernando who helped us<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,439
together a special report on six nations

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,810
called the mavens and why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you tell</font>

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,399
us what they are yeah well I guess

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,399
essentially the mavens are Mexico

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,750
Australia Vietnam Indonesia Nigeria in

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,969
South Africa what we were looking for

13
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,460
are sort of some of some of the less

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,899
appreciated growth stories out in the

15
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,920
market and particularly company

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,449
countries that would actually feed into

17
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,219
the growth that's feeling the bricks

18
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay let's back up one second what were</font>

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,510
the bricks and why do we have this thing

20
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,430
called the bricks well the bricks were

21
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,600
originally created by goldman sachs they

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,930
were basically looking to find you know

23
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,090
what are the sort of the largest growth

24
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,750
stories in the world out to 2050 they

25
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,520
went through obviously a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,159
countries and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> came down with four I</font>

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,310
also think it was you know part of it is

28
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,549
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> investment idea it was also i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

29
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,189
really in marketing in that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

30
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to create a catchy term which</font>

31
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,210
essentially everyone took on board

32
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,950
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses it sure they even have I</font>

33
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,960
mean they've benchmark to follow there

34
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,180
are funds that base themselves on that

35
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,229
concept so yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's a</font>

36
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of validity and the concept of the</font>

37
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,970
bricks except<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps for Russia which I</font>

38
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,180
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an outlier but at the</font>

39
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,409
same time you have to admit it as

40
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,700
excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> marketing so let's just talk</font>

41
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">about a couple of the the mavens</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nations</font>

42
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,920
tell me why Australia isn't it well I

43
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,159
think again the key concept that I think

44
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,350
we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you want</font>

45
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,119
countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are leveraged to global</font>

46
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,439
growth Australia is one of the most

47
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,878
blessed countries in terms of

48
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,670
commodities and in that sense it's it's

49
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,959
literally building<font color="#E5E5E5"> China</font>

50
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,370
you know most directly through iron<font color="#E5E5E5"> ore</font>

51
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,739
exports which go into steel which build

52
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,390
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the cities of China needs</font>

53
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,519
to build all the infrastructure so it's

54
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,650
highly<font color="#E5E5E5"> levered to that growth at the</font>

55
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,799
same time while<font color="#CCCCCC"> population-wise austria</font>

56
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:31,310
looks small now really when you think

57
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,900
about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Australia could be the</font>

58
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,000
next us at some point right a large

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,400
country has a lot of land<font color="#CCCCCC"> has resources</font>

60
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,720
really what holds it back as simply

61
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,000
water shortages so I mean I'm not saying

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,720
that's going to be solved immediately

63
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,030
but it's also that<font color="#CCCCCC"> long term story there</font>

64
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,860
that theoretically you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a much</font>

65
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,599
larger population so theoretically if

66
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,739
they solve the water desalination

67
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,900
problem you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could get waves of</font>

68
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,910
immigrants from the rest of Asia start

69
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,530
to populate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> interior shorter and</font>

70
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,709
become an RA to an extent Australia<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

71
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,359
that now they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> were pretty</font>

72
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:04,069
progressive immigration policy where

73
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:06,530
they invite people from a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

74
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">countries and most of them come from</font>

75
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">South Asia and East Asia to actually</font>

76
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,450
come and live there because obviously

77
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,299
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no short of line there right</font>

78
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:15,349
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

79
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:17,090
ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may surprise people why is</font>

80
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nigeria on the list I think Nigeria</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

81
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,720
well first of all it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the largest of</font>

82
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">the most populous nation in Africa it</font>

83
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,019
also recently became a democracy in 1999

84
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:32,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> while obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's probably the</font>

85
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:37,519
longest term story of the mavens there's

86
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,780
there's been a lot of good<font color="#E5E5E5"> science</font>

87
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,060
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the country in terms of</font>

88
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,980
having a government that's actually

89
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,630
interested in the economic<font color="#CCCCCC"> growth of a</font>

90
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,160
country rather than just sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

91
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,910
a kleptocracy and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fitting with</font>

92
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">the other countries in the collection</font>

93
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,709
it's extremely rich in commodities

94
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,069
primarily oil so on that metric while

95
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:00,440
the rest of Nigeria's economy has a long

96
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,510
way to develop they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually ride</font>

97
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,940
oil for quite some time use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that cash</font>

98
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,010
flow to diversify the domestic economy

99
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,290
and in the long run there's a huge

100
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">population this is a huge domestic what</font>

101
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:13,970
is the population of guys 220 million

102
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,520
people

103
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,769
what will that be in 2050 I'm sorry

104
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,930
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's 155 million now it's going to</font>

105
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,570
220 and then into site believed to 60

106
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,800
around there<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

107
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,770
about one South Korea will was left up

108
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,780
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones</font>

109
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,510
that Goldman Sachs<font color="#E5E5E5"> X actually considered</font>

110
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,020
in the beginning right yeah actually

111
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,220
people people may not know this but the

112
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,440
bricks was actually potentially going to

113
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,870
have to more countries they were going

114
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be Mexico and South Korea we've</font>

115
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,150
included Mexico obviously I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> South</font>

116
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,740
Korea the promise South Korea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

117
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,840
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> already come a long way they're</font>

118
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,270
already essentially fully developed a

119
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,310
much of the story's over they'll do very

120
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,660
well in the future but in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next 25</font>

121
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,040
years they actually of a declining

122
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,750
population in the same way that Japan

123
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,410
does so you don't have the explosive

124
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,970
growth stories of these other companies

125
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what's what are some of the other so</font>

126
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,220
what would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is like the big</font>

127
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,260
takeaway what to look for in terms of

128
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,970
you know if you're an investor what's

129
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,430
the key idea here though well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

130
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,830
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of ways to play countries</font>

131
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,750
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily the stock market in</font>

132
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,490
one country so there's also for example

133
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,720
there's a lot of multinationals that

134
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,430
have operations in different countries I

135
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,110
think for some of these markets say

136
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,600
obviously in Nigeria idiot there's

137
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably limited opportunities for sort</font>

138
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the average retail investor it's</font>

139
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably more private equity story right</font>

140
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,330
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you look into some other</font>

141
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,870
markets like Indonesia Vietnam you know

142
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,280
there could start to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> more sort of</font>

143
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,200
equity stories there as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

144
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,550
it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it depends on the market</font>

145
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright well thanks for talking with us</font>

146
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,130
and pay attention the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years and</font>

147
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,050
the next 40 years is all going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

148
00:06:01,050 --> 00:00:00,000
about yes the bricks but also the Mavis
