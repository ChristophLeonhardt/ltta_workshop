1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,830
I was never a girly girl.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:07,590
I think femininity today is
about practicality and reality.

3
00:00:22,596 --> 00:00:25,190
We are actually a
studio of all women,

4
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,900
which just kind of
naturally happened.

5
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,400
It's really
empowering, actually,

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,980
because being a woman,
designing for women,

7
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,924
you'd think that a lot of
women are part of the process.

8
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:39,740
And that's actually the
case in this building.

9
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,890
This is the only room in the
building which has four walls

10
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,900
and a door, so
it's quite private.

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,550
This is my golden Irish
potato, because I'm Irish.

12
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,050
This is my lucky money.

13
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,350
I was very fortunate to
grow up in his studio.

14
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,720
It was my absolute
favorite place to be.

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,600
I don't do mood boards for a
collection, but on this wall,

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,890
I have things that are
always inspiring me,

17
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:23,040
or that I'm connected to, like
Louise Bourgeois and her big

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,434
pink boobs â€”

19
00:01:24,434 --> 00:01:26,850
which is so amazing, because
it's something very feminine,

20
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,970
but they're hard, and
it's very sculptural.

21
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,250
I love that contrast.

22
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,090
When I'm in here, it's usually when I
have my little sticker on the door,

23
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,530
like do not disturb,
which most people ignore.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,850
So this is our sample
room, where we do all

25
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,770
our construction
of the garments,

26
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,190
and all our pattern cutting.

27
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,210
We're working on all our
invitations for the show.

28
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,800
But this season, they're all
stitched within the studio.

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,980
So you can see the girls
here are working on it now.

30
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,930
And then inside here, you
can see we're doing handwork

31
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,730
on the collection.

32
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,400
I did one show eight
months pregnant,

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,160
so it was impossible for
it not to really influence

34
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,390
the collection.

35
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,130
We did all these
red drippy earrings,

36
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,900
which were supposed to
almost be like blood.

37
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,210
And it was all very,
very grotesque.

38
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,030
Yeah, but it's a reality.

39
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,310
I want to be very
honest with what I do.

40
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,110
I don't want to
create a fantasy.

41
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,715
I want to tell a story, and
I want to create an emotion.

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,150
I really love working
alongside my mother.

43
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,890
She is kind of my partner.

44
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,910
And what I've really learned
from her is her attention to detail,

45
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,220
and that refinement and elegance
is something that is so her,

46
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,136
and something that
I love working with her on.

47
00:03:14,136 --> 00:03:17,870
I do feel that
slip is very dark.

48
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,480
True.

49
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,380
The fashion industry
changes all the time.

50
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,190
Whatever you do is always
going to be going in or out

51
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,920
of fashion at some point.

52
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,650
I'm very lucky, because I
have grown up around it.

53
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,670
I've seen the industry in so
many different guises that

54
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,050
it's given me the
confidence to go,

55
00:03:39,050 --> 00:00:00,000
this is how I want to do it.
