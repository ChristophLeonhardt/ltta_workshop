9:00 THIS MORNING. 
>>> LET'S GO NOW TO CAPITOL 
HILL. 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS TIPS 
BEFORE THE SENATE FOREIGN 
RELATIONS COMMITTEE ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT'S CONTROVERSIAL 
SUMMIT WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN.
>>  OCCUPIED PORTIONS OF 
GEORGIA, CONTINUES TO VIOLATE 
THE INF TREATY, HAS REPORTEDLY 
HACKED UNITED STATES UTILITIES, 
THE LIST GOES ON AND YOU KNOW 
THE LIST. 
THE FACE OF THESE HOSTILITIES, 
IN THE SUMMIT'S AFTERMATH WE 
SAW AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT WHO  
APPEARED DISMISSIVE. 
WE HAVE HEARD THIS SOME 
AGREEMENT WAS REACHED BUT AS OF 
YET HAVE LITTLE IDEA WHAT THOSE 
MAY BE OPEN THOUGH THE 
PRESIDENT HAS EXTENDED AN 
INVITE TO PUTIN TO COME TO 
WASHINGTON TO DISCUSS THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE 
UNDEFINED AGREEMENTS. 
THE PRESIDENT RECENTLY MET THE 
PRESIDENT OF NORTH KOREA. 
ONE OF THE MOST ARE THELESS 
LEADERS ON THE PLANET WHO HAS 
CONTINUED TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR 
WEAPON THAT COULD HIT THE 
UNITED STATES. 
HAS EXECUTED HIS HALF BROTHER 
AND KILLED HIS UNCLE BACK HOME 
AS ESSENTIALLY MURDERED AN 
AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENT AND 
HAS ENSLAVED MILLIONS OF HIS 
OWN PEOPLE. 
ONE IN TEN NORTH KOREA 
RESIDENTS LIVING IN SLAVERY AND 
ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN ARE 
STUNNED BECAUSE OF LACK OF 
FOOD. 
IN THE FACE OF THESE REALITIES 
THE PRESIDENT HAS CALLED HIM 
VERY TALENTED AND THAT HE LOVES 
HIS PEOPLE. 
REALLY? 
AT THE NATO SUMMIT THE 
PRESIDENT NOT ONLY PUSHED NATO 
MEMBERS TO DEDICATE MORE OF 
THEIR BUDGETS TO DEFENSE, A 
GOAL WE ALL SHARE, HE WENT ONTO 
B ERA TE THEM, QUESTION THE 
PREMISE OF NATO AND IN MY 
OPINION USED FALSE OPINION TO 
TURN PUBLIC OPINION IN THE 
UNITED STATES AGAINST THE 
ALLIANCE. 
HE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO CAST 
DOUBT ON THE UNITED STATES 
WILLINGNESS TO ENFORCE ARTICLA 
OF THE NATO TREATY. 
WE WANT TO KNOW IF THIS IS REAL 
OR JUST ANOTHER OFF THE CUFF 
STATEMENT. 
AND THE CONFRONTING OF OUR 
PARTNERS GOES BEYOND 
TRADITIONAL SECURITY AND 
EXTENDS TO THE ECONOMIC SPACE 
AS WELL. 
I KNOW YOU ARE AWARE OF MY 
STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THE 
ADMINISTRATION'S ABUSE OF ITS 
AUTHORITIES AND USING SECTION 
232 TO PUT IN TARIFFS IN THE 
NAME OF NATIONAL SECURITY. 
SO FAR WE HAVE ZERO CLARITY 
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AS TO 
WHAT THE END GAME IS ON THE 
TRUMP, PENCE TARIFFS WHICH IN 
REALITY ARE A MASSIVE TAX 
INCREASE ON AMERICAN CONSUMERS 
AND BUSINESSES AND NOW THE 
ADMINISTRATION APPEARS READY TO 
OFFER WELFARE TO FARMER WHO 
WOULD RATHER HAVE TRADE THAN 
AID. 
AS YOU KNOW SENATORS HAVE GONE 
TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN GROUPS TO 
DISCUSS THESE ACTIONS AND NOT A 
SINGLE PERSON THAT I'M AWARE OF 
HAS LEFT THOSE MEETINGS WITH 
THE SENSE THAT THERE IS A 
COHERENT STRATEGY DRIVING THESE 
POLICIES. 
THE ADMINISTRATION TELLS US 
DON'T WORRY, BE PATIENT. 
THERE'S A STRATEGY HERE BUT 
FROM WHERE WE SIT IT APPEARS 
THAT IN A READY, FIRE AIM 
FASHION THE WHITE HOUSE IS 
WAKING UP EVERY MORNING AND 
MAKING IT UP AS THEY GO. 
THIS IS A FIRST IN A SERIES OF 
HEARINGS WE WILL HOLD IN COMING 
WEEKS DEALING THE TROUBLING 
DYNAMIC I HAVE DESCRIBED, ONE 
IN WHICH WE ARE UPSETTING OUR 
FRIENDS AND PLACATING THOSE WHO 
CLEARLY WISH US ILL. 
THIS SERIES WILL DEAL 
SPECIFICALLY WITH RUSSIA AS 
PERHAPS THE MOST TROUBLING 
EXAMPLE OF THIS EMERGING 
REALITY. 
I HOPE HA IN YOUR POSITION YOU 
WILL DO ALL IN YOUR POWER TO 
PROVIDE US WITH THE ANSWERS WE 
NEED TODAY AND AS WE MOVE 
FORWARD IN OUR FUTURE HEARINGS 
I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR 
TESTIMONY AND I WANT TO THANK 
YOU AGAIN FOR BEING WITH US AND 
FOR THE MANY OUTSTANDING PEOPLE 
YOU ARE BRINGING ONTO THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH YOU. 
WITH THAT I WILL TURN TO 
SENATOR MENENZED. 
>>  LET ME START BY SAYING 
APPLAUD YOU FOR MAKING THIS THE 
FIRST OF A SERIES OF OVERSIGHT 
HEARINGS ON RUSSIA. 
THE COMMITTEE HAS GONE FOR 
ABOUT A YEAR WITHOUT A FULL 
COMMITTING ON RUSSIA OR NORTH 
KOREA. 
I APPRECIATEY LEADERSHIP IN 
THIS REGARD. 
NOW IT SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN A 
THREE RING CIRCUS OF A DEBACLE 
OF A MEETING, I WALK BACK OF IF 
THE PRESIDENT TRUSTS HIS OWN 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS, THE 
SUGGESTION THAT IT MAY BE EVEN 
OKAY FOR A UNITED STATES 
DIPLOMAT TO BE INTERROGATED BY 
RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE AND THE 
REALITY TV SUMMIT THAT WAS 
LITTLE MORE THAN A PHOTOGRAPH 
OP WITH A DICT ATO TO MERIT ONE 
HEARING THE SECRETARY OF STATE. 
HAVING SAID THAT MR. SECRETARY, 
WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. 
THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE 
ARE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF 
STRATEGIC, WELL CRAFTED 
DIPLOMARY TO ADVANCE THE 
FOREIGN POLICY INTERESTS. 
UNFORTUNATELY ALL WE HAVE COME 
TO EXPECT IN A SABER RATTLING 
PRESIDENT WHO EMBRACES AND 
PROVIDING THE LEGITIMACY TO 
SOME OF THE WORLD'S BAD ACTORS 
AND WHO UPSETS OUR CLOSEST 
ALIES. 
WE HAVE NOT SEE ANY DEALS OR 
STRATEGY THAT PUT AMERICANS OR 
AMERICAN NATIONAL SECURITY 
FIRST. 
WE HAVE SEEN OUR PRESIDENT LOOK 
BEAK AS HE STANDS BESIDE OUR 
ADVERSARI, S AND INTENDS TO 
ROLL OUT THE RED CARPET AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE, I HEAR THAT'S 
POSTPONED TO JANUARY BUT TO 
INVITE PUTIN TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE, A THUG ACTIVELY TRYING 
TO UNDERMINE OUR ELECTIONS. 
WE IN THIS BODY ARE TAKE HEED 
OF OUR OFFICIALS AND WORKING TO 
PROTECT OUR COUNTRY FROM THE 
FLASHING RED LIGHTS OF ONGOING 
RUSSIAN AGGRESSION. 
SENATOR GRAHAM AND I AND OTHERS 
PLAN TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION 
IN THE COMING DAYS TO ENSURE WE 
HAVE THE TOUGHEST TOOLS TO GO 
AFTER RUSSIA BAD ACTORS. 
AS OF THIS MOMENT WE FIND 
OURSELVES IN A SITUATION. 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ELECTED 
OFFICIALS IN THIS BODY AND 
MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENT'S OWN 
CABINET HAVE HEARD MORE ABOUT 
THE MEETING FROM PUTIN AND HIS 
ASSOCIATES THAN FROM OUR 
PRESIDENT. 
WE KNOW THAT THE KREMLIN STATE 
RUN MEDIA HAVE A DUBIOUS 
COMMITMENT TO THE TRUTH BUT WE 
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH IS 
BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE WAS IN THE 
ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENED. 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EXPECT AND 
I BELIEVE THEY DESERVE TO KNOW 
WHAT HAPPENED. 
I HAVE SERIES QUESTIONS ABOUT 
THE SUMMIT THAT TOOK PLACE 
NEARLY TWO MONTHS AGO. 
IN THAT TIME WE HAVE YET TO 
HEAR OR SEE ANYTHING THAT 
PROVIDES US WITH REAL 
CONFIDENCE THAT NORTH KOREA AS 
THE PRESIDENT GLOATED NO LONGER 
POSES A LATE TO THE UNITED 
STATES OR THAT WE HAVE A 
STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE A 
VERIFIABLE DENUCLEARIZATION 
AGREEMENT. 
WE HAVE ONLY SEE A VAGUE 
AGREEMENT OF PROMISES TO MAKE 
MORE PROMISES BUT OF WEAKER 
COMMITMENTS THAN NORTH KOREA 
HAS PREVIOUSLY MADE. 
THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH 
KOREA SEEM TO REMAIN FARAH PART 
ON EVEN BASIC ISSUES LIKE THE 
DEFINITION OF DENUCLEARIZATION. 
IN FACT OVER THE PAST 18 MONTHS 
UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION'S 
WATCH NORTH KOREA HAS PERFECTED 
ITS MISSILES, AND TESTED IT'S 
LARGEST NUCLEAR DETONATION 
RATHER THAN ANY STEPS TO 
DISMANTLE ITS PROGRAM. 
IT SEEMS THE LEADER OF NORTH 
KOREA GOT EVERYTHING HE WANTED 
INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL 
RECOGNITION AND THE SUSPENSION 
OF UNITED STATES MILITARY 
EXERCISES. 
THIS WEEK'S REPORTS OF 
DISMANTLEMENT AT A LAUNCHING 
STATION MAY BE GOOD NEWS BUT IT 
MAY BE A SIGNAL THAT NORTH 
KOREA HAS COMPLETED ALL THE 
TESTING IT NEEDS TO. 
FRANKLY THE AGREEMENT SEEMS 
MORE OF THE ART OF CONCESSIONS 
THAN THE ART OF THE DEAL. 
WE ARE WEAKER FOR IT. 
LAST WEEK RUSSIA AND CHINA 
BLOCKED A UNITED STATES REQUEST 
TO IMPOSE PENALTIES ON 
SANCTIONS VIOLATIONS CALLING 
OUR MAXIMUM PRESSURE POSTURE 
INTO QUESTION. 
AS YOU KNOW I HAVE INTRODUCED 
OVERSIGHT LEGISLATION ALONG 
WITH SENATOR GARDNER TO PROVIDE 
THE SORT OF SUPPORT AND 
GUIDANCE THAT THIS EFFORT NEEDS 
AND EXERCISE THE OVERSIGHT 
RESPONSIBILITY CONGRESS OWES TO 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
GOAL THAT YOU HAVE LAID OUT 
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE ARE 
INCORPORATED. 
FINALLY LET ME RAISE ONE MORE 
DEEPLY ALARMING ISSUE THAT 
BROKE THIS WEEK. 
I UNDERSTAND THAT DESPITE ITS 
ABILITY TO STOP THE RIDICULOUS 
IDEA THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS 
ABOUT TO ALLOW INTERNET POSTING 
OF DO IT YOURSELF 3D PRINTABLE 
FIREARM BLUEPRINTS. 
WHY ON EARTH WOULD THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION MAKE IT EASIER 
FOR TERRORISTS AND GUN MEN TO 
PRODUCE UNDETECTABLE PLASTIC 
GUNS? 
I REMAIN DEEPLY CONCERNED BY 
THE ADMINISTRATION'S VIEWS. 
WE NEED STRATEGIES ACROSS THE 
WORLD BECAUSE THE RESULT OF THE 
LACK IS CHAOS AND CONFUSION OR 
EVEN WORSE. 
I RECOGNIZE THE PRESIDENT 
CONSIDERS HIMSELF TO BE A 
MASTERFUL DEAL MAKER AND A VERY 
STABLE GENIUS. 
WE NEED TO CALL THE PRESIDENT'S 
STATEMENTS OUT FOR WHAT THEY 
ARE, AT THIS POINT I FIND THEM 
TO BE MISLEADING AND 
UNTRUTHFUL. 
I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR 
TESTIMONY TO FIND OUT WHAT THE 
TRUTH REALLY IS. 
THANK YOU. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. 
SECRETARY. 
WE WELCOME YOU AGAIN AND -- YOU 
CAN SUMMARIZE YOUR COMMONS.  
WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR 
TESTIMONY. 
>>  GOOD AFTERNOON.  
THE LAST FEW WEEKS I HAVE 
ENGAGED IN THREE AREAS OF 
PARTICULAR INTEREST TO THIS 
COMMITTEE. 
NORTH KOREA, NATO AND RUSSIA. 
THE SUBJECT OF RUSSIA I WANT TO 
BRING SOMETHING TO YOUR 
ATTENTION RIGHT OFF THE BAT 
TODAY. 
TODAY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
IS RELEASING THE CRIMEA 
DECLARATION. 
LY SUBMIT IT TO THE RECORD. 
ITS BEEN RELEASED AS WELL. 
ONE PART READS AS FOLLOW. 
THE UNITED STATES CALLS ON 
RUSSIA TO RESPECT THE 
PRINCIPLES AND TO END ITS 
OCCUPATION OF CRIMEA. 
END OF QUOTE. 
I WANT TO SHOW THIS COMMITTEE 
THAT THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT 
AND WILL NOT RECOGNIZE THE 
ANNEXING OF CRIMEA. 
WE STAND TOGETHER WITH THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN OUR 
COMMITMENT TO UKRAINE . THERE 
WILL BE NO RELIEF OF SANCTIONS 
UNTIL RUSSIA RETURNS CONTROL OF 
THE PENINSULA TO UKRAINE. 
THIS FORMAL EYES UNITED STATES 
POLICY OF NONRECOGNITION. 
THERE'S ANOTHER PROGRESS.  
IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS. 
ONE THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN 
ENGAGING IN SOMETHING THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN WORKING ON 
AS WELL.  
IN DECEMBER. 
IN LATE APRIL I STARTED 
EXECUTING ON THE STRATEGY OF 
SECRETARY STATE AND TODAY ON 
JULY 1ST -- TODAY -- HERE WE 
ARE AND I WANT TO PRESENT YOU 
SOME PROGRESS.  
THESE PRINCIPLES HAVE DIVIDE 
OUR ACTIONS ON NORTH KOREA. 
THE PRESIDENT'S DIPLOMACY 
DEESCALATED A SITUATION WHICH 
THE PROSPECT FOR CONFLICT WAS 
RISING DAILY. 
AMERICANS ARE SAFER BECAUSE OF 
HIS ACTIONS. 
AS FAR THE GOALS ON NORTH 
KOREA, NOTHING HAS CHANGED. 
OUR OBJECTIVE REMAINS THE 
FINAL, FULL, DENUCLEARIZATION 
AS AGREED TO. 
FOLLOW UP TO THE PRESIDENT'S 
SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT WITH CHAIRMAN 
KIM. 
ON JULY 5TH I TRAVELED TO NORTH 
KOREA TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THE 
COMMITMENT THAT WERE MADE IN 
SINGAPOR. 
WE ARE ENGAGED IN PATIENT 
DIPLOMACY BUT WON'T LET IT DRAG 
OUT TO NO END. 
I TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE 
DISCUSSIONS I HAD. 
THE PRESIDENT REMAIN UP BEAT 
ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
PROGRESS IS MANY HAING. 
WE NEED CHAIRMAN KIM TO FOLLOW 
THROUGH ON HIS MINTMENTS. 
UNTIL THEY ELIMINATE THEIR 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION OUR 
SANCTIONS AND THOSE THAT THE 
UNITED NATIONS WILL REMAIN IN 
EFFECT. 
MULTIPLE UN SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESOLUTIONS REQUIRE THEM TO 
ELIMINATE ALL OF THEIR WEAPONS 
OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND MISSILE 
PROGRAMS. 
THOSE WERE PASSED AND THEY 
REMAIN BINDING. 
WE NEED EVERY SINGLE NATION TO 
MAINTAIN THE ENFORCEMENTS OF 
THOSE SANCTIONS TO WHICH EVERY 
NATION IS COMMITTED. 
THE PATH AHEAD IS NOT EASY BUT 
OUR HOPES FOR ASSEVER WORLD AND 
A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR NORTH 
KOREA ENDURE. 
THE NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 
ALSO CALLS FOR PEACE THROUGH 
STRENGTH. 
THE PRESIDENT'S ENGAGEMENT ON 
NATO HAS HE RESULTED IN GREATER 
BURDEN SHARE THAT WILL 
STRENGTHEN THE ALLIANCE AGAINST 
THREATS. 
ALLIES HAVE SPENT MORE THAN $40 
MILLION IN INCREASED DEFENSE 
SPENDING SINCE 2016. 
THERE WILL BE HUNDREDS OF 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS MORE IN THE 
YEARS AHEAD. 
LAST YEAR'S 14.4 BILLION IN NEW 
SPENDING WAS A 5.1 INCREASE IN 
THE LARGEST IN A GENERATION. 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS 
DEMANDING THAT EVERY COUNTRY 
MAKE IT'S OWN COMMITMENT. 
NATO WILL REMAIN A PILLAR OF 
AMERICAN NATIONAL SECURITY. 
WE KNOW WEAKNESS PROVOKES OUR 
ENEMIES BUT STRENGTH PROTECT 
US. 
THE MORE EVERY MEMBER 
CONTRIBUTES THE BETTER THE 
ALLIANCE CAN DEFER THREATS. 
THIS IS THE INCREASED 
COMMITMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT 
WANTS. 
FROM THE OUTSET THIS 
ADMINISTRATION THE NATIONAL 
DEFENSE STRATEGY AND THE RUSSIA 
INTEGRATED STRATEGY THE 
APPROACH HAS BEEN THE SAME. 
TO RAISE THE COST OF AGGRESSION 
UNTIL PUTIN PICKS A LEFT 
CONFRONTATIONAL FOREIGN POLICY 
WHICH KEEPING THE PROGRAM OPEN 
FOR DIALOGUE. 
THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA 
POSSESS OVER 90% OF WORLD'S 
NUCLEAR WEAPON. 
THEY 14 NOT HAVE A BAD 
RELATIONSHIP. 
THIS IS NOT JUST IN OUR 
INTEREST BUT IN THE INTEREST OF 
THE ORLANDO. 
HE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT NOW IS 
THE TIME FOR DIRECT 
COMMUNICATION AND OUR 
RELATIONSHIP IN ORDER TO MAKE 
SEARCH TO PRESIDENT PUTIN THAT 
THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY, 
HOWEVER REMOTE IT MAY BE TO 
REVERSE THE NEGATIVE COURSE OF 
OUR RELATIONSHIP. 
OTHERWISE THE ADMINISTRATION 
WILL CONTINUE TO IMPOSE TOUGH 
ACTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA IN 
RESPONSE TO ITS ACTIVITIES. 
WE CAN'T MAKE PROGRESS ON 
ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN UNLESS 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THEM. 
I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT FOR 
YEARS. 
I'M REFERRING TO STOPPING 
TERORISM STOPPING THE CIVIL 
WAR IN SYRIA, ENSURING SECURITY 
FOR ISRAEL AND HUTTING TOWN ALL 
OF IRAN'S MALIGN ACTIVITIES. 
ON THE SUBJECT OF IRAN THE 
PRESIDENT HAS SAID IRAN IS THE 
NO THE SAME COUNTRY AS FIVE 
MONTHS BASSOS OUR CAMPAIGN OF 
FINANCIAL PRESSURE, AND OUR 
FULL THROATED SUPPORT FOR THE 
PEOPLE OF IRAN IN ARE HAVING AN 
IMPACT. 
WE SOUGHT TO LOOK AT IF RUSSIA 
WANTED TO IMPROVE OUR 
RELATIONSHIP BUT MADE CLEAR THE 
BALL IS IN RUSSIA'S COURT. 
WE DEFENDED AMERICA'S STRATEGIC 
INTERESTS IN SYRIA AND UKRAINE 
AND I MADE CLEAR TO THE RUSSIAS 
THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES FOR 
INTERFERENCE IN THE DEMOCRATIC 
PROCESSES. 
I WOULD ADD THAT THE PRESIDENT 
IS A WARE OF THE CHALLENGES 
THAT RUSSIA POSES TO THE UNITED 
STATES AND OUR PARTNERS. 
HE HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF 
ACTIONS TO PROTECT OUR 
INTERESTS. 
AS JUST A FEW PIECES OF PROOF I 
WOULD PSYCHE TO SITE THE 
FOLLOWING. 
213 SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA GROUP 
ANDS INDIVIDUALS. 
60 RUSSIAN SPIES EXPELL FROM 
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN 
THE CLOSURE OF THE CONSULAT 
ACTION IN SEATTLE. 
THE CLOSURE EVER RUSSIA'S 
CONSULATE IN SAN FRANCISCO. 
CUTTING UNITED STATES STARRING 
BY RUSSIA BY ALMOST 70%. 
150 MILITARY EXERCISES HAVE 
BEEN PARTICIPATED IN EUROPE 
THIS YEAR ALONE. 
MORE THAN 11 BILLION HAVE BEEN 
PUT FORWARD FOR THE EUROPEAN 
DEFENSE INITIATIVE. 
WE MADE DEFENSIVE WEAPONS 
AVAILABLE TO UKRAINE AND TO 
GEORGIA. 
JUST LAST WEEK THE DEPARTMENT 
OF DEFENSE. 
THIS IS AFTER THE SUMMIT ADDED 
ANOTHER $200 MILLION IN 
SECURITY COOPERATION FUNDS TO 
UKRAINE. 
NONE OF THIS HAPPENED FOR THE 
EIGHT YEARS THAT PRECEDED 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU. 
THERE'S A LONG LIST I'M HAPPY 
TO GO THROUGH IT. 
I'M GUESSING SOMETIME TODAY I 
WILL GET THAT OPPORTUNITY. 
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT. 
FINALLY I WANT TO YOU KNOW THAT 
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID ACCEPTS 
THE CONCLUSION THAT RUSSIA 
PLEDLED IN THE ELECTION. 
HE UNDERSTANDS WHAT HAPPENED. 
I KNOW. 
I BRIEFED HIM ON IT FOR OVER A 
YEAR. 
THIS IS PERFECTLY CLEAR TO ME. 
I AM ALSO CERTAIN THAT HE 
DEEPLY RESPECTS THE DIFFICULT 
AND DANGEROUS WORK THAT OUR 
PATRIOTS IN THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY DO AND HE FEELS THE 
SAME WAY ABOUT THE AMAZING 
PEOPLE THAT WORK AT THE UNITED 
STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE. 
THANK YOU. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
SECRETARY STAFF HAS ASKED THAT 
WE ABSOLUTELY STAY TO THE SEVEN 
MINUTE DEAL. 
IF WE CANNOT ASK FIVE PART 
QUESTIONS AND END AT 6:58. 
IF YOU CAN GIVE THE PERSON TIME 
TO RESPOND I WOULD APPRECIATE 
IT. 
WITH THAT I WILL DEFER TO 
SENATOR MENENZED AND WITH HOLD 
MY TIME FOR INTERJETIONS ALONG 
THE WAY. 
>>  MR. SECRETARY. 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT MEETS ALONE 
WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN IT ALLOWS 
THE KREMLIN STATE SPONSORED 
MEDIA AND THE RUSSIAN MINISTRY 
OF DEFENSE TO PROVIDE MORE 
INFORMATION, AT LEAST FROM 
THEIR PERSPECTIVE TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE MEMBERS 
OF THE PRESIDENT'S OWN CABINET. 
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU SOME 
QUESTIONS TO GET TO UNDERSTAND 
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. 
HAS THE PRESIDENT TOLD YOU WHAT 
HE AND PRESIDENT PUTIN 
DISCUSSED IN THEIR TWO HOUR 
CLOSED DOOR MEETING? 
>>  YOU CAN PUT YOUR MICROPHONE 
ON. 
>>  I'M SORRY. 
THE PRESIDENT CAN PICK WHO IS 
IN A MEETING OR NOT. 
YOU HAVE HAD PRIVATE MEETINGS. 
YOU HAVE PICKED THAT SETTING. 
>>  I JUST ASKED A SIMPLE 
QUESTION. 
DID YOU -- DID HE TELL YOU 
WHETHER OR NOT -- WHAT HAPPENED 
IN THOSE TWO HOURS IN. 
>>  YES AND YOUR QUESTION 
SUGGESTED SOME IDEA THAT 
SOMETHING IMPROPER HAPPENED 
ABOUT HAVING A ONE ON ONE 
MEETING AND I DISAGREE. 
>>  DID HE TELL YOU WHAT 
HAPPENED? 
>>  I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF 
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENED. 
I WAS PRESENT WHEN HE AND 
PRESIDENT PUTIN BOTH GAVE US A 
SENSE OF WHAT THEY DISCUSSED IN 
THE MEET THAT FOLLOWED. 
I HAD THE CHANCE TO SPEAK -- 
ABOUT THE RUSSIAN VIEW. 
I THINK I HAVE A COMPLETE 
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENED. 
>>  DID YOU TALK TO THE 
TRANSLATOR? 
>>  I HAVEN'T. 
>>  HAVE YOU SEEN HER NOTES? 
>>  SENATOR. 
I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN -- I HAVE 
HAD A LOT OF NOTE TAKERS AND 
TRANSLATORS. 
I HAVE NEVER RELIED ON THE WORK 
THAT THEY DID TO UNDERSTAND 
WHAT HAPPENED AND IT DOESN'T 
NEED TO BE DONE HERE AND WON'T 
BE. 
>>  DID THE PRESIDENT DISCUSS 
RELAXING UNITED STATES 
SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA? 
>>  SENATOR THE UNITED STATES 
MILLION IS HE WITH RESPECT TO 
SANCTIONS REMAINS COMPLETELY 
UNCHANGED. 
>>  THE PRESIDENT DID NOT YOU 
ARE -- I ASKED A SPECIFIC 
QUESTION. 
>>  I GAVE YOU A SPECIFIC 
ANSWER. 
>>  YES OR NO? 
>>  THE PRESIDENT IS ENTITLED 
TO HAVE A PRIVATE MEETING. 
I'M TELLING YOU UNITED STATES 
POLICY. 
>>  YOU TOLD ME THAT HE HAD A 
CONVERSATION WHERE HE TOLD YOU 
WHAT HAPPENED. 
I THINK THE NATION AND ALL OF 
US WHO ARE POLICY MAKERS 
DESERVE TO KNOW SO THAT WE CAN 
FASHION POLICY ACCORDINGLY. 
DID HE TELL PUTIN THAT OUR 
RELEASE OR RELAX SANCTIONS? 
>>  SENATOR. 
WHAT YOU NEED TO CONDUCT YOUR 
ROLE, YOUR APPROPRIATE ROLE I 
WILL PROVIDE YOU TODAY. 
THAT IS UNITED STATES POLICY 
WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUES THAT 
YOU REQUEST. 
YOU ASK ME ABOUT UNITED STATES 
POLICY WITH RESPECT TO 
SANCTIONS AND I CAN CONFIRM 
THAT YOU THAT NO COMMITMENT HAS 
BEEN MADE TO CHANGE THOSE 
POLICIES IN ANY WAY. 
>>  DID THE PRESIDENT AT THIS 
MEETING CALL UPON PRESIDENT 
PUTIN TO WITHDRAW FROM CRIMEA 
AND UKRAINE? 
>>  I STARTED MY STATEMENT 
TODAY WITH THE UNITED STATES 
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY. 
>>  I UNDERSTAND THAT. 
I WELCOME IT I'M GLAD THAT IT 
SEEMS LIKE WE HAD TO DO A LOT 
OF EFFORT TO GET THERE. 
THE QUESTION IS WHEN HE HAD A 
CHANCE DID HE CONFRONT PUTIN 
AND SAY WE DON'T RECOGNIZE YOUR 
ANNEXING OF CRIMEA, YOUR 
HOSTILITIES IN UKRAINE AND 
THERE'S CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT? 
>>  THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY 
CLEAR WITH PUTIN ABOUT UNITED 
STATES POSITIONS. 
THE UNITED STATES POSITION THAT 
ARE THE TRAUMA ADMINISTRATION 
POSITIONS AND HE SPOKE ABOUT 
THEM VERY FIRMLY AND CLEARLY 
WHEN HE MET WITH PUTIN. 
>>  AND HE TOLD YOU THAT? 
>>  SENATOR. 
I'M TELLING YOU WHAT HE HAD A 
CONVERSATION WITH PUTIN ABOUT 
AND I'M TELLING YOU WHAT UNITED 
STATES POLICY IS TODAY. 
I UNDERSTAND -- I UNDERSTAND 
THE GAME THAT YOU ARE PLAYING. 
I DO. 
>>  WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I 
DON'T APPRECIATE YOU -- MY 
QUESTION IS TO GET TO THE 
TRUTH. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH 
IS. 
>>  YOU DO. 
>>  THE ONLY WAY WE WILL KNOW 
WHAT THE TRUTH IS, WHAT HAPPEN 
IN THOSE TWO HOURS AND IN -- 
AMAZING PERIOD OF TIME TO SPEND 
ALONE, ONE ON ONE IS MY 
UNDERSTANDING THAT IF YOU WERE 
BRIEFED BY THE PRESIDENT WHAT 
WE TOLD YOU. 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S UNFAIR TO 
KNOW, TO UNDERSTAND WHAT POLICY 
IS. 
WHERE -- DID THE PRESIDENT SAY 
THEY WERE GOING TO CHANGE OUR 
STRUCTURE IN SYRIA? 
>>  SENATOR. 
PRESIDENTS ARE PERMITTED TO 
HAVE CONVERSATIONS WHEN THEIR 
CABINET MEMBERS THAT AREN'T 
REPEATED IN PUBLIC. 
I OWE THE PRESIDENT THE 
CAPACITY FOR HIM TO HAVE A 
CONVERSATION WITH HIM, PROVIDE 
HIM THE BEST FOREIGN POLICY I 
CAN. 
IT'S WHAT I WAS BROUGHT ONTO DO 
AND. 
>>  HERE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU 
CAN ANSWER FOR ME. 
>>  GREAT. 
>>  YOU AREN'T GOING TO ANSWER 
ANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WOULD 
GET US TO THE TRUTH. 
AS CIA DIRECTOR YOU SAID YOU 
EXPECT RUSSIA TO CONTINUE ITS 
ATTACKS BY ATTEMPTING TO 
INTERFERE IN THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS. 
IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH PUTIN 
I HOPE THE PRESIDENT LAID OUT 
THE CONSEQUENCES OF 
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2018 
ELECTION BUT I KNOW YOU CAN'T 
TELL ME. 
>>  I CAN. 
>>  YOU WANT TO SHARE THAT ONE. 
THAT ONE YOU WANT TO SHARE? 
>>  THE PRESIDENT HAS DISCLOSED 
THAT ONE. 
THE PRESIDENT DISCLOSED WHAT HE 
SAID TO PUTIN ABOUT RUSSIA 
INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTIONS 
AND HE SAID THAT HE IS 
CONFIDENT THAT AS A RESULT OF 
THAT CONVERSATION PUTIN 
UNDERSTANDS IT WON'T BE 
TOLERATE. 
>>  I WISH HE SAID THAT IN 
PUBLIC IN HELSINKI. 
WE ARE WORKING ON A BILL TO 
HOLD RUSSIA RESPONSIBLE. 
GIVEN THAT YOU ASSERT THE 
ADMINISTRATION IS TOUGH ON 
RUSSIA WILL YOU COMMIT TO 
WORKING WITH US ON A NEW 
SANCTIONS BILL? 
>>  YES. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
>>  NORTH KOREA. 
WHEN YOU LAST APPEARED I ASKED 
YOUA SERIES OF CRITICAL 
CONDITIONS ABOUT WHAT'S OUR 
POLICY AND TO YOUR CREDIT I 
MUST SAY THAT I LARGELY AGREED 
WHAT OUR GOALS ARE. 
NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU SINCE 
SINCE WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING 
AS IT RELATES TO NORTH KOREA. 
DID NORTH KOREA AGREE WITH OUR 
DEFINITION OF DENUCLEARIZATION 
MEAN THE REMOVAL OF ALL NUCLEAR 
WEAPON FACILITIES, TECHNOLOGY 
AND MATERIAL FROM NORTH KOREA? 
>>  I THINK I CAN ANSWER BUT 
LET ME START BY SAYING I'M 
ENGAGED IN A COMPLEX 
NEGOTIATION WITH THE NORTH úKOR 
THIS PUBLIC SETTING TO SHARE 
THE DETAILS OF EVERY 
CONVERSATION THAT TOOK PLACE IN 
THOSE. 
I WILL ATTEMPT TO ANSWER 
WITHOUT DISCLOSING THE CONTENTS 
OF THE NEGOTIATION. 
I AM VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE 
NORTH KOREAS UNDERSTAND OUR 
DEFINITION OF DENUCLEARIZATION 
THAT GOES FROM INFRASTRUCTURE. 
>>  WE UNDERSTAND THAT. 
YOU LAID IT OUT FOR THE RECORD. 
DID THEY -- HAVE THEY AGREED 
YOU THAT IT. 
I BELIEVE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT 
AND THEY. 
>>  THEY UNDERSTAND IT BUT 
DIDN'T AGREE. 
DID THEY AGREE TO END THE 
PRODUCTION OF URANIUM? 
>>  I WOULD WELCOME THE CHANCE 
TO RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTIONS IF 
YOU WOULD LET ME FINISH. 
IT WOULD BE MOST. 
>>  YES OR NO? 
>>  IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR THE. 
>>  IT'S A SIMPLE YES OR? 
>>  DID -- DID NORTH KOREA 
AGREE TO END THE PRODUCTION OF 
URANIUM FOR MILITARY PROGRAMS 
IN. 
>>  THEY AGREED TO 
DENUCLEARIZE. 
IT INCLUDES -- IT INCLUDES THE 
FULL RANGE. 
>>  I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO 
COME TO A CLASSIFIED SETTING 
TELL ALL MEMBERS WHAT HAPPENED 
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW. 
>>  THANK YOU SENATOR. 
>>  MR. SECRETARY. 
THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS JOB. 
THE PRESIDENT MADE A WISE 
DECISION IN APPOINTING YOU AS 
SECRETARY OF STATE AND YOU ARE 
ACQUITTING YOURSELF VERY WELL 
HERE TODAY AND WE APPRECIATE 
THAT. 
YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN STRAIGHT 
FORWARD WITH US AND I HAVE 
APPRECIATED THAT. 
I KNOW MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES, 
NOT ALL BUT MANY OF MY 
COLLEAGUES FULLY APPRECIATE 
THAT. 
I WANT TO TALK. 
>>  PROSECUTE YOU PREPARED TO 
SAY MOST OR JUST GO WITH MANY ? 
>>  I WILL STAY WITH MANY. 
LET ME SAY THAT AS FAR AS WHAT 
HAPPENED AT THE NATO SUMMIT. 
VERY FEW AMERICANS HEARD 
ANYTHING EXSEPTEMBER THE 
ARGUMENT THAT WENT ON ABOUT THE 
FUNDING. 
NOW I KNOW THE PRESIDENT 
BELIEVES AND I KNOW YOU BELIEVE 
AND I BELIEVE AND I THINK MOST 
EVERYBODY BELIEVE THAT NATO IS 
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MILITARY 
ALLIANCE IN THE HISTORY OF THE 
WORLD. 
AS YOU POINTED OUT IT'S ONE OF 
THE PILLARS OF OUR NATIONAL 
SECURITY AND ONE THAT WE NEED 
TO SUPPORT AND ONE WE NEED TO 
WORK WELL. 
THERE ARE VERY FEW DOWNSIDES OF 
NATO BUT THERE IS ONE AND THE 
PRESIDENT HAS -- UNDER SCORED 
THAT PUBLICLY AND WELL. 
HIS PREDECESSOR ATTEMPTED TO DO 
IT. 
ALL THEIR PREDECESSORS TRIED TO 
DO IT. 
ALL THOSE OF US THAT MEET WITH 
THE EUROPEANS FROM TIME TO TIME 
UNDER SCORE IT AND THAT IS THE 
FUNDING OR THE LACK OF FUND 
THAT THE EUROPEANS HAVE DONE. 
ONLY EIGHT OF THE -- THE NATO 
NATIONS ARE ACTUALLY MEETING 
THE COMMITMENT OF 2%. 
THE FIRST OF ALL THE PRESIDENT 
IS TO BE COMMENDED FOR UNDER 
SCORING THIS AND GETTING THEM 
TO START TALKING ABOUT IT AND 
NOW FINALLY STARTING TO AGREE 
TO THAT. 
THERE WERE OTHER THINGS THAT 
WERE LOST AS FAR AS THAT 
MEETING AND I WOULD LIKE TO YOU 
TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS FOR A 
FEW MEMBERS. 
NUMBER ONE IS ON THE DETERRANT 
SIDE SPEEDING UP THE TIME TO 
TAKES ALLIES TO PUT TOGETHER 
AND DEPLOY FORCES. 
THE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE MOBILITY 
AND ENHANCE THE SPEED AT WHICH 
THEY CAN MAKE DECISIONS. 
THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM AND 
INCREASE IN ALLIED RESILENCE 
AGAINST TERRORIST THREATS 
THROUGH A NEW FRAMEWORK TO 
SHARE BIOMETRIC TASTE DATA AND 
OPPORTUNITY FOR MACEDONIA TO BE 
INVITED TO JOIN NATO. 
THAT WAS A POISIVE STEP. 
COULD YOU COMMENT ON THOSE 
VOLUNTARY IMPORTANT STEPS 
FORWARD THAT HAPPENED AT THE 
SUMMIT? 
>>  IT WAS A VERY PRODUCTIVE 
SUMMIT. 
FROM MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE 
SECRETARY GENERAL HE SAID AMONG 
THE MOST PRODUCT I HAD BEEN A 
PART OF. 
HE HAS BEEN DOING THIS A LITTLE 
WHILE. 
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 430. 
30 SQUADRONS, 30 BATTALIONS, 
AND 30NAVAL. 
IT'S SOMETHING NATO HASN'T BEEN 
READY TO DO IN SOME TIME. 
NOW THERE'S A REAL COMMITMENT. 
WITH VERY TO MAKE SURE THAT 2 
HAPPENS. 
IT WOULD BE I GREAT THING TO 
DETER RUSSIA IF WE CAN GET 
THOSE COUNTRIES AND OUR ALLIES 
TO GET TO THAT LEVEL. 
YOU TALKED ABOUT BURDEN 
SHARING. 
IT SEEMS TO GET ALL THE FOCUS. 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE 
EUROPEANS ARE AS COMMITTED TO 
DEFERRING RUSSIA AND NEED TO 
SHOW THAT THROUGH THEIR DOLLARS 
AND LEADINESS.  
TALKED ABOUT THE RISK THAT 
CREATES TO THE AYALA,AS AND THE 
EVENT THAT RUSSIA SHOULD DECIDE 
TO USE ENERGY AS A WEAPON TO 
COERCE FORMERLY ORRIN FORMERLY 
GERMANY OR OTHER COUNTRIES. 
HE RACED TO THE FOREFRONT AND 
THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 
UNDERSTAND THAT RISK AND 
SUPPORT AMERICA AND OUR 
POSITION ON THAT AS WELL. 
AND TALKED ABOUT THE NATO 
MISSION. 
IT'S NEW ROLE IN FIGHTING 
TERRORISM. 
I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO SO 
MANY OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRY 
THAT HAVE STEPPED FORWARD. 
EVEN JUST THIS PAST FEW -- I 
GUESS IT'S NOW TWO WEEKS SINCE 
THE SUMMIT. 
OVER A THOUSAND ADDITIONAL 
COMMITMENTS FROM ALLIED NATO 
PARTNERS HEADED TO HELP US IN 
OPERATION LESS LUTE SUPPOR  IN 
AFGHANISTAN. 
IT'S A GREAT COMMITMENT. 
SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT WORKED 
HARD ON AT THE SUMMIT AND GOOD 
OUTCOMES FORMER. 
>>  THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
YOU ARE TO BE COMMENDED FOR 
THOSE GREAT SUCCESSES AS IS THE 
PRESIDENT FOR LEADING IN THAT 
REGARD. 
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT OUR 
FRIENDS AND ALLIES, FEATHERS 
WERE RUFFLED A LITTLE BIT JUST 
BECAUSE WE SAID THEY WEREN'T 
PAYING THEIR BILLS. 
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME 
TIME AND I THINK WE WILL 
TOLERATE THAT BUT THEY HAVE GOT 
TO STEP UP AND I KNOW YOU UNDER 
SCORED THAT AND THE PRESIDENT 
HAS UNDER SCORED THAT. 
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IRAN FOR 
JUST A MOMENT. 
ONE OF -- THE BIG UNREPORTED 
STORIES AS FAR AS FOREIGN 
RELATIONS IS CONCERNED IS THE 
ISSUES AND THE DIFFICULTIES 
THAT THE IRAN PEOPLE ARE HAVING 
INTERNALLY. 
FINANCIALLY AND OTHERWISE. 
I KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT IN A 
CLASSIFIED SETTING BUT THERE IS 
SOME OPEN REPORTING ON THESE 
SOURCES AND THE GOVERNMENT 
THAT'S THERE IS STRUGGLING WITH 
THIS. 
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHY 
THEY TRIED TO POKE THE 
PRESIDENT THE OTHER DAY TO TRY 
TO TAKE THEIR -- TRY TO TAKE 
THE HEAT OFF OF THE -- HEAT 
THEY ARE GETTING AT HOME. 
COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT 
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON 
INTERNALLY? 
KNOWING THAT WE ARE IN -- IN AN 
OPEN SETTING? 
>>  SENATOR THERE IS -- HUGE 
ECONOMIC CHALLENGE INSIDE OF 
IRAN TODAY. 
IT'S AN ECONOMIC STRUCTURE THAT 
DOESN'T WORK. 
WHEN YOU ARE A COUNTRY OF THAT 
SCALE THAT FORMENTS TERROR, 
CONDUCTS ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS 
IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, 
PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR ASSAD, 
THAT'S EXPENSIVE. 
I THINK THE IRAN PEOPLE PEOPLE 
ARE STARTING TO SEE THAT'S NOT 
WHAT THEY WANT. 
THAT THE IRAN EXPANSION THAT 
THE SUPREME LEADER SO FAVORS IS 
NOT WHAT THEY WANT. 
I THINK ARE YOU STARTING TO SEE 
THECONOMIC IMPACT COMBINED 
THAT 2 WAS.  
THE UNDERSTANDING HAS BEEN 
RAPID OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS. 
> Y. IT'S -- I THINK THAT IT'S 
-- ITS BEEN GOING ON LONGER 
THAN THAT. 
>>  ITS BEEN GOING ON LONGER 
BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE 
ACCELERATION. 
>>  THAT'S A FAIR STATEMENT. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
>>  IF I COULD JUST -- ONE 
INTERJECTION. 
I KNOW THE WORDS PAYING THEIR 
BILLS MAN ABOUT SPICE WE NEED 
EVERY NATO COUNTRY NEEDS TO BE 
CONTRIBUTING 2% TO DEFENSE AND 
I HAVE NOTICED THOSE NEAR THE 
RUSSIAN BORDER ALWAYS DO. 
THERE'S -- THAT'S A 
MISUNDERSTANDING. 
WE WANT THEM TO CONTRIBUTE AT 
LEAST 2%. 
THEY ARE NOT NOT PAYING BILLS 
TO THE UNITED STATES AS 
SOMETIMES IS PROJECTED, IS THAT 
CORRECT? 
>>  THE SHORT FALLS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT IDENTIFIED ARE IN TWO 
BUCKETS. 
THERE IS A NATO COMMON FUND 
THAT'S CONTRIBUTED TO BY EVERY 
NATION AND THE UNITED STATES IS 
BY FAR THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR 
OF THAT FUND AND THEN MONEY 
THAT ARE PAID FOR NATIONS TO 
RAISE THEIR OWN MILITARIES AND 
TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. 
THAT'S THE 2% NUMBER TO WHICH 
WE HAVE BEEN. 
>>  DEPTHS NOT -- IT WOULD BE A 
MISUNDERSTANDING TO SAY -- TO 
MAKE IT APPEAR THAT THEY AREN'T 
PAYING BILLS TO THE UNITED 
STATES. 
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 
THAT'S CORRECT. 
>>  THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. 
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO INVITE 
MR. PUTIN TO THE UNITED STATES 
TO FOLLOW UP ON THE 
UNDERSTANDINGS REACHED IN THE 
SUMMIT. 
CAN YOU BRIEFLY SAY WHAT THOSE 
UNDERSTANDINGS IROR AGREEMENTS 
AT THE MEETING? 
>>  SURE.
I CAN --  
IT'LL BE BUSINESS LEADERS THAT 
WANT TO PARTICIPATE. 
I UNDERSTAND THIS WENT ON FOR 
YEARS AND YEARS AND WAS . 
>>  IF WE COULD DO IT BRIEFLY. 
I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO GIVE A 
COMPLETE THING. 
>>  IT'S WHAT YOU ASKED FOR. 
>>  I UNDERSTAND. 
BUSINESS TO BUSINESS. 
NEXT ISSUE. 
>>  THE PRESIDENT -- HAS ASKED 
US TO LOOK AT REESTABLISHING A 
COUNTER TERRORISM COUNCIL THAT 
WAS HELD AT THE LEVEL OF THE 
DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR 
MANY YEARS BUT HAD STOPPED. 
I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE. 
>>  COUNTER TERRORISM 
COOPERATION. 
>>  WE ARE WORKING TO SEE IN 
SYRIA WHAT ARE THE 
POSSIBILITIES THAT CAN BE 
ACHIEVED SO THAT THE NOW 
BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN MILLION 
DISPLACED PEOPLE HAVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN. 
WE MADE IT CLEAR IT SHOULD 
HAPPEN IN GENEVA BUT WE ARE 
WORKING TO SEE IF WE CAN GET 
RUSSIA TO BE MORE COOPERATIVE 
IN TERMS OF DRIVING TOWARD A 
POLITICAL RESOLUTION THAT WOULD 
TAKE DOWN THE VIOLENCE LEVELS 
AND CREATE OPPORTUNITY TO START 
A LIKAL RESOLUTION OF THE 
PROCESS IN SYRIA. 
>>  ANY DISCUSSIONS ON 
SANCTIONS, ON YOU SAID THERE 
WAS NO LETTING UP OF THE 
SANCTIONS. 
>>  NO SENATOR. 
>>  WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION 
ABOUT -- CERTAIN NAMES 
ASSOCIATED WITH HIM CAME OUT. 
WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION ON THE 
THE SANCTIONS? 
>>  THERE'S BEEN NO CHANGE. 
I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU WILL 
REFERRING TO. 
LET ME MAKE CLEAR. 
THE UNITED STATES WILL DEFEND 
OUR TEAM IN THE FIELD AND THE 
TEAM THAT'S BEEN IN THE FIELD 
WHEN IT RETIRES AND LEAVES THE 
FIELD. 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT AMERICANS 
DESERVE THE PROTECTION OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BOTH 
DURING THEIR TIME IN SERVICE 
AND AFTER. 
>>  WAS THERE ANY AGREEMENTS 
REACHED IN REGARDS TO UKRAINE? 
>>  NO.
AGREE TO DISAGREE. 
THAT IS -- THE UNITED STATES 
POLICY HASN'T CHANGED YOU CAN 
SEE THAT. 
$200MILLION. 
SINCE THE HELSINKI SUMMIT 
PROVIDED TO THE UKRAINE YANS. 
I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF 
CONCERN THAT -- I SAW IT. 
I COULD FIND YOU ALL THE QUOTES 
IF YOU WANT. 
CONCERNS THAT THE PRESIDENT 
WOULD MAKE A CHANGE IN POSITION 
WITH RESPECT TO. 
>> AND YOU MADE THAT CLEAR. 
>>  AND THERE IS NO CHANGE. 
IT IS -- IT IS A POLICY THAT 
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION 
REFUSED TO UNDERTAKE. 
I HERE COMPARISONS -- IT'S 
IMPORTANT. 
COMPARISON MATTERS HERE. 
THERE'S A NARR ATIVE THAT IS HE 
IS WEAK ON RUSSIA WHEN THE 
OPPOSITE IS TRUE. 
>>  I HEARD YOU TALK AND BRAG 
ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SANCTIONS. 
>>  THEY WERE JUST FACTS. 
>>  FACT THAT THE CONGRESS 
PASSED THE STATUE THAT REQUIRED 
SANCTIONS TO BE IMPOSED AND THE 
SANCTION THAT ARE TO BE IMPOSED 
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN IMPOSED. 
THE FACTS ARE THE 
ADMINISTRATION SOUGHT A WAIVER. 
I WANT TO POINT OUT AND WE HAVE 
HAD THIS FROM PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATIONS BUT NOT AT MUCH 
AS WE ARE HEARING TODAY THAT 
WHAT CONGRESS IS REQUIRING YOU 
TO DO YOU FUND RELIGION AND ARE 
TAKING CREDIT FOR IT. 
IN REALITY YOU HAVEN'T PUT IN 
ON TIME THE SUBSTANTIAL 
SANCTION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED 
BY CONGRESS. 
>>  FOR OF ALL THAT'S NOT TRUE. 
WE HAVE PASSED A NUMBER OF 
SANCTIONS UNDER THE PROVISIONS 
AND IT'S ALSO TRUE, MY BEST 
RECOLLECTION OF THE 
CONSTITUTION IS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT SIGNED THAT LAW AS 
WELL SO. 
>> AND HE COMPLAINED WHEN HE D. 
>>  I THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING 
THAT LAW. 
WE APPRECIATE IT. 
WE THINK IT MAKES GOOD SENSE. 
THE PRESIDENT SIGNED IT. 
WE HAVE PASSED SANCTIONS UNDER 
THAT VERY LAW. 
WE HAVE PASSED SANCTIONS THAT. 
YOU JUST -- PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATIONS DIDN'T DO? 
>>  PLEASE READ THE PRESIDENT'S 
COMMENT AND HE SIGNED THE LAW. 
IT'S VERY INTERESTING. 
LET ME MOVE ONTO OR POLICY.  
IN NORTH KOREA WE HAVE A 
COUNTRY THAT HAS A NUCLEAR 
WEAPON WEAPON. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS MET WITH THE 
LEADER OF THAT COUNTRY AND HAS 
AT LEAST GIVERREN A SIGNAL TO 
SOME COUNTRIES THAT IN FACT 
THERE MAY BE RELAXATION. 
WE ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH 
CHINA TODAY AS I UNDERSTAND. 
IN IRAN WE HAD A COMMITMENT FOR 
A SHORT TERM ENDING OF THEIR 
NUCLEAR PROGRAM. 
WE WERE ABLE TO ISOLATE IRAN, 
GETTING THE SUPPORT OF CHAIN A 
RUSSIA AND EUROPE AND WE WERE 
ABLE TO KEEP THE TEMPERATURE 
DOWN IN REGARD TO THE NUCLEAR 
PROGRAM. 
NOW BY PULLING OUT WE DON'T 
HAVE ANY SHORT TERM COMMITMENTS 
BECAUSE THEY AR ALREADY 
SANCTIONED UNDER THE UNITED 
STATES. 
WE HAVE BEEN ISOLATED, NOT IRAN 
AND OF COURSE IRAN TODAY WAS 
NOT -- PURSUING A NUCLEAR 
PROGRAM. 
I AGREE WITH YOU THERE MAY 
BELONG TERM ISSUES. 
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME 
UNDERSTANDING OUR STRATEGY IN 
REGARDS TO PREVENTING NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS LAST POINT. 
WE HAD A HEARING IN THIS 
COMMITTEE AS TO WHAT IS 
NECESSARY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH 
NORTH KOREA ON GIVING UP 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
THE FIRST THICK THEY TALKED 
ABOUT. 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FULL 
DECLARATION AND A TIMELINE OF 
DISMANTLING. 
I'M GETTING MY INFORMATION NOW 
FROM THE SOUTH KOREA'S, NOT THE 
AMERICANS. 
SOUTH KOREA HAVE BEEN REPORTED 
TO SAY YOU ASK FOR THAT 
INFORMATION AND YOU HAVEN'T 
BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT 
INFORMATION FROM KIM OR HIS 
REPRESENTATIVES. 
WHAT HAVE WE GOTTEN? 
IN NORTH KOREA AND WHY ARE WE 
ALLOWING NORTH KOREA TO 
CONTINUE TO HAVE A NUCLEAR 
WEAPON WHEN THE STRATEGY IS 
THAT AS LONG AS -- IRAN IS 
DOING ANY TYPE 67ENRICHM. 
>>  THAT WAS A LONG QUESTION. 
LET ME TRY TO UNPACK IT. 
LET ME GIVE YOU THE COMMON 
THEME. 
WE WANT NEITHER IRAN NOR NORTH 
KOREA TO HAVE THE CAPACITY OF 
CREATE NUCLEAR WEAPONS, ENRICH 
URANIUM OR BUILD A WEAPONS 
PROGRAM. 
THAT'S THE MISSION. 
IT DRAWS THEM TOGETHER. 
THAT SETS CONDITIONS FOR THE 
PRESIDENT'S UNDERSTANDING OF 
HOW ONE ACHIEVES THIS IN THE 
WORLD AND THAT'S THE MISSION 
STATE WE ARE UNDERTAKING IN 
EACH OF THE TWO COUNTRIES. 
THEY ARE IN DIFFERENT PLACES 
AND WE ARE WORKING ON THE 
APPROACH IN EACH PLACE WE THINK 
INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD. 
I KNOW A MISSION YOU SHARE. 
>>  SECOND IN INTERJECTION. 
I MENTIONED WAS MADE OF A 
WAIVER IN THE NDA A BY 
SECRETARY MATTIS. 
HE WOULDN'T WANT TO BE DEMOTED 
TO THAT LEVEL, I KNOW. 
I SUPPORT THAT. 
THE PURPOSE OF THAT WAIVER, WAS 
TO ALLOW COUNTRIES THAT WERE 
DEALING WITH THAT WE WISH TO 
BUY AMERICAN MILITARY EQUIPMENT 
TO BE WEANED OFF RUSSIAN 
EQUIPMENT TO PUT IN STRATEGIES 
WORKING WITH THEM TO PUSH BACK 
AGAINST OTHER COUNTRIES. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>>  YOU CAPTURE IT VERY WELL. 
WE BOTH PUT FORWARD THIS 
PROPOSAL. 
A REQUEST FOR THE WAIVERS. 
THESE ARE COUNTRIES WITH 
HISTORIC RUSSIAN WEAPON 
SYSTEMS. 
IF WE DENY THEM THE CAPACITY TO 
HAVE SPARE PARTS THEN WE LIKELY 
TO DRIVE THEM TO THE HANDS OF 
THE RUSSIANS. 
WITH REWORKING TO WORK IN THE 
EFFECT OF THE STATUE. 
IT'S PRETTY NARROW. 
>>  CAN I REPLY TO THAT? 
>>  GO HEAD. 
>>  MY POINT IS THAT THIS IS AN 
ISSUE WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE BILL. 
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO DEBATE 
IN THIS COMMITTEE ON THE WAIVER 
REQUEST BY THE ADMINISTRATION. 
I TAKE -- I DISAGREE WITH THE 
CHAIRMAN AS TO IF IT WAS 
HANDLED RIGHT THAT THE 
COUNTRIES HAD OVER A YEAR TO 
RESOLVE THAT. 
>>  IT HAD BECOME AN ACUTE 
ISSUE AND IT'S DEFENSE RELATED 
ISSUE.  
. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
JUST WATCHING TO SEE IF THEY 
RESET MY CLOCK. 
LIKE AN NBA GAME. 
>>  RESET THE CLOCK. 
>>  IT'S ALL RIGHT. 
WE WILL FIGURE IT OUT. 
I WILL TELL YOU WHEN IT'S TIME 
IS UP. 
ON THE -- WHEN PUTIN DECIDED TO 
INTERFERE IN THE ELECTIONS YOU 
WOULD AGREE HE UNDERTOOK A COST 
BENEFIT ANALYSIS. 
THIS IS WHAT THE PRICE WOULD BE 
FOR THIS? 
THIS IS THE BENEFIT I WOULD 
GAIN FROM IT. 
SO, WE WHERE IT LEAVES US IS WE 
HAVE TO DO TWO THINGS. 
WE HAVE TO DEFEND AGAINST 
POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE. 
I THINK THE OTHERS WE HAVE TO 
MAKE SURE THE PRICE IS HIGHER 
THAN THE BENEFIT. 
THAT POINTS TO -- ONE OF THE 
THINGS YOU MENTIONED AND THAT 
IS WHEN WE HAVE DONE. 
IF YOU START TO LINE UP SOME OF 
THE THINGS WE HAVE DONE IN 
RESPONSE TO THAT AND OTHER 
THINGS IT'S AN  EXTENSIVE LIST, 
INCLUDING THINGS WE HAVE ASKED 
FOR YEARS SUPPORT OF THE NEW 
POSTURE IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN 
EUROPE. 
THE VARIETY OF ORDERS FROM THE 
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. 
SANCTIONSAND I KNOW THERE'S 
MORE TO COME. 
SEVERAL ROUNDS OF DESIGNATIONS. 
TERROR AND TRANSNATIONAL CRIME. 
EXPORT RESTRICTIONS ON GROUP 
THAT VIOLATED THE INF TREATY. 
WE CLOSED CONSULATES IN SAN 
FRANCISCO, SEATTLE, AN 
ANNEX234DC, A TRADE OFFICE IN 
NEW YORK AFTER THEY POISONED 
NERVE GAS ATTACK IN THE UK. 
WE EXPELLED 60 OTHER DIPLOMATS. 
OBVIOUSLY EVEN THAT PRICE IS 
NOT HIGH ENOUGH BECAUSE THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 
CONTINUES TO SAY THAT THEY ARE 
POSTURED AND ARE ACTIVELY 
ENGAGED IN BOTH ATTACKING OUR 
DEMOCRACY AND MORE OF THAT IN 
THE FUTURE. 
THE QUESTION AND -- IT TAMES TO 
DO THREE THINGS. 
ONE DEFINE INTERFERENCE. 
IT'S NOT JUST FIVE RUSSIAN GUYS 
ON TWITTER. 
IT'S DEFINE IT IN TERMS OF ITS 
MEANING TO OUR REPUBLIC. 
REQUIRE THAT THE DIRECTOR OF 
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE TO ISSUE 
A REPORT WITH IN 0 DAYS OF THE 
ELECTION ABOUT IF INTERFERENCE 
HAPPENED AND PUT IN STATUTE A 
MENU OF -- VERY CRIPPLING 
SANCTIONS AND THE PURPOSE OF 
THAT WOULD BE SO THAT PUTIN 
KNOWS BEFORE HE MAKES THE 
DECISION GOING TO 18 OR IN THE 
FUTURE. 
THIS IS THE PRICE I WILL PAY IF 
I DO THIS AGAIN. 
THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED A DEFER 
ACT TO GET ON THE FRONT END OF 
IT. 
ON THE CONCEPT OF BUILDING IN 
DETERRANTS ON THE FRONT END IS 
THAT NOT AN APPROACH WE CAN 
TAKE TO HOPEFULLY DEFER HIM 
FROM DOING THIS IN THE FUTURE 
BY MAKING CLEARLY UNDERSTAND 
HOW HIGH THE PRICE WOULD BE IN 
COMPARISON TO THE BENEFIT? 
>>  I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT 
IS A COST COMPARISON. 
PUTTING ON INFORMATION WITH A 
FAIL SAFE IF YOU WILL ABOUT 
THING THAT WILL FOLLOW HAS THE 
LIKELIHOOD OF BEING SUCCESSFUL 
IN RAISING THE COSTS IN TERMS 
OF HOW HE WORKS OUT RISK 
ASSOCIATED WITH -- A WIDE RANGE 
OF ACTIONS. 
>>  LET ME -- YOU WILL BE ASKED 
PLENTY ABOUT RUSSIA. 
I TONIGHT WANT TO UNDERMINE 
THAT. 
I THINK THE SINGLE BIGGEST 
NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT IN THE 
LONG TERM TO THE UNITED STATES 
IS CHINA. 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE 
END OF THE COLD WAR WE ARE IN 
COMPETITION WITH A NEAR PEER 
ADVERSARY AND IT'S MILITARY, 
ECONOMIC, WE HAVE SEEN THEIR 
IMPRESSIVE AND MASSIVE MILITARY 
BUILD UP, THE LEAPS THEY ARE 
MAKING IN TECHNOLOGY. 
WE SEE THAT THE WORK THEY ARE 
UNDERTAKING TO SORT OF DESTROY 
THE UNITED STATES WORLD ORDER 
AND REBUILD IT TO ONE MORE OF 
THEIR LIKING. 
WE HAVE SEEN THE GAINS THEY 
HAVE DE. 
CHINA MOBILE WILL BE THE ONLY 
ONE TO BUILD 5G NETWORKS BY 
2020 AND MANY OF THESE ARE NOT 
THE RESULT OF HARD WORK BUT 
THEY ARE THE RESULT OF PROPERTY 
THEFT, FORCED TRANSFERS AND THE 
LIKE. 
THIS IS PART OF A TACTIC THEY 
HAVE USED FOR A WHILE. 
THE CHINESE AND THE SOUTH CHINA 
SA IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF IT. 
THEY DON'T MAKE THESE BIG 
SWEEPING CHANGES. 
IT'S SORT OF A SUSTAINED, SORT 
OF SLOW BUT MORE ASSERTIVE 
DEMANDS, CREATING NEW NORMAL AS 
LONG THE WAY. 
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE 
SOUTH CHINA SEA IS EVIDENCE OF 
THAT. 
THE ONLY THING THAT SEEMS TO 
WORK IS COMMITTED AND   SUSTAIN
ED WORK. 
OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP, 
SUSTAINED COMMITTED PRESSURE 
AND THE OTHERS HELP OF OUR 
FOREIGN PARTNERS. 
WHAT I'M TROUBLED BY IN REGARDS 
TO THE ADMINISTRATION POSTURE 
ON THIS IS -- ON THE WORKING 
WITH, GETTING THE HELP OF 
FOREIGN PARTERS IS COMPLICATE 
BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE TRADE 
DISPUTE WAS THE EU AND JAPAN, 
MEXICO AND CANADA WHICH WE 
SHOULD HAVE TEAMED UP WITH TO 
PROPER CONTINUITY THEM. 
I UNDERSTAND TRADE IS A PROBLEM 
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT 
MY -- I DON'T KNOW WHY WE 
DIDN'T ADDRESS CHINA FIRST AND 
THEN DEALT WITH THE ALLIES 
SECOND. 
THE OTHERS THE SUSTAINED AND 
COMMITTED ESCALATING ACROSS THE 
RELATIONSHIP. 
ON THAT FRONT I'M PUZZLED BY 
THE DECISION THE ADMINISTRATION 
MADE ON ZTE. 
I KNOW THAT WASN'T A STATE 
DEPARTMENT ISSUE. 
IT WAS A COMMERCE ONE. 
I AGREE THAT IF THE ZTE ISSUE 
WAS A SANCTIONS VIOLATION THE 
PENALTIES IMPOSED HAVE BEEN 
DEVASTATING. 
ZTE IS MORE THAN A SANCTION 
THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES. 
ITS PART OF A BROADER, 
COMMUNICATION THREAT THAT THE 
CHINESE INDUSTRIES POSE TO THE 
UNITED STATES AND TO THREATEN 
TO SHUT THEM DOWN AND THEN PULL 
BACK FROM IT IS NOT THE SORT OF 
COMMITTED AND SUSTAINED 
ESCALATING ACROSS THE 
RELATIONSHIP. 
THE CARVING OUTS OF ONE 
COMPANY, SENDS IN THE MESSAGE 
THAT THEY CAN PICKAWAY AT 
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THAT 
RELATIONSHIP AND UNDERMINE OUR 
WILLINGNESS TO SUSTAIN PRESSURE 
ON THEM TO GET A GETTER DEAL. 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT'S ROLE WAS IN THAT 
DECISION BUT MOVING FORWARD 
WHEN IS OUR BROADER STRATEGIC 
APPROACH TO THE THREAT THAT 
CHINA POSES BECAUSE THEY SEEK 
TO OVER TAKE US. 
>>  YOU HAVE LAID OUT WHAT IS 
THE PRINCIPAL CHALLENGE FOR THE 
UNITED STATES OVER THE COMING 
YEARS. 
MAYBE DECADE. 
THE ISSUE OF CHINA. 
THEY ARE -- YOU TALK ABOUT THEY 
HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS AND THE BIG 
ECONOMY. 
THAT PUTS THEM IN THE POSITION 
TO COMPETE IN A WAY THAT A 
COUNTRY LIKE RUSSIA WITH AN 
ECONOMY SMALLER THAN ITALY 
CAN'T MAINTAIN OVER SOME PERIOD 
OF TIME. 
SO WE DO NEED A BROAD RESPONSE 
AND I THINK ALL OF THE WEST, 
NOT JUST THE UNITED STATES WAS 
TO SLOW IN SEEING THIS. 
YOUR POINT ABOUT HOW THEY 
TURNED UP THE HEAT SLOWLY 
OVERTIME. 
THAT RECOGNITION IS THERE BUT I 
DON'T THINK THE STRUCTURE IS IN 
PLACE TO RESPOND TO THAT. 
I WAS WITH OUR AUSTRALIAN 
PARTNERS YESTERDAY AT A MEETING 
WITH THE SECRETARY AND OUR 
STRAYING YAN COUNTERPARTS. 
THEY JUST PASSES A 
NONINTERFERENCE RULE. 
THEY ARE GETTING UP TO SPEED IN 
THE SAME WAY THAT YOU ALL TOOK 
A LOOK WERE GETTING UP TO 
SPEED. 
WE ARE BEGINNING TO STRIKE THAT 
THINK WILL DO WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED. 
ALLOW AMERICA TO PREVAIL. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
SENATOR SHEEN. 
>>  THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
MR. SECRETARY. 
I WANT TO THANK YOU, ASSISTANT 
SECRETARY MITCHELL FOR YOUR 
HARD WORK AND COORDINATION ON 
THE EFFORTS TO RELEASE PASTOR 
BRUNSON. 
HIS MOVE FROM PRISON TO HOUSE 
ARREST IS A POSITIVE 
DEVELOPMENT. 
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO 
DID IN TERMS OF GETTING HIM 
BACK TO THE UNITED STATES. 
ALSO PRESSING THE TURKISH 
GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE THE OTHER 
AMERICANS THEY ARE HOLDING. 
IT'S A POSITIVE STEP. 
THANK YOU FOR THAT. 
I AM CONCERNED MR. SECRETARY 
BECAUSE ITS BEEN A WEEK.  
WE HAVE HEARD A NUMBER EVER 
STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS 
INCLUDING THOSE WHO WERE 
PRESENT IN THE MEETING ON IRAN. 
INDICATE THAT THEY STILL DON'T 
HAVE A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF 
WHAT WAS DISCUSSED AND WE ARE 
SEEING THE KREMLIM RELEASING 
THEIR OWN READ OUTS AND 
BROADCAST NEWS OF VARIOUS 
AGREEMENT THAT THEY SAY WERE 
REACHED IN THAT MEETING. 
SO, FOR ME THAT IS WHY I'M SO 
CONCERNED AND WHY I WANT TO 
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS AGREED TO 
IN THAT MEETING. 
ON SYRIA, THE PRESIDENT SAID 
THAT -- AT HIS JOINT NEWS 
CONFERENCE THAT THE TWO LEADERS 
DISCUSSED SYRIA AT LENGTH. 
THE RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF 
DEFENSOR THAT INDICATED THAT 
THE TWO LEADERS AGREED TO 
MILITARY COOPERATION IN SYRIA. 
DID THEY DO THAT? 
>>  SENATOR, THE UNITED STATES 
POLICY WITH RESPECT TO 
DECONFLICTS WITH RUSSIA HAS NOT 
CHANGED. 
I WILL DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT 
OF DEFENSE FOR DETAILS AROUND 
THAT. 
THAT -- I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE 
POLICY THAT WAS IN PLACE WITH 
RESPECT TO THEIR EFFORTS TO 
KEEP AMERICAN PILOTS SAFE AND 
KEEP AMERICAN FORCES SAFE IN 
SYRIA, THAT POLICY HAS NOT 
CHANGED. 
>>  DO YOU KNOW IF THEY 
DISCUSSED THAT POLICY? 
IF THEY DISCUSSED. 
>>  I DO KNOW THEY DISCUSSED 
SYRIA. 
THEY ABSOLUTELY DISCUSSED 
SYRIA. 
THE FOCUS OF THAT DISCUSSION, I 
THINK THE PRESIDENT SAID WAS AN 
EFFORT TO FIND A POLITICAL 
RESOLUTION THERE AND TO GET THE 
DISPLACED PERSONS THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN TO SYRIA. 
AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT 
TALKED ABOUT ONE MORE ITEM. 
AS THE PRESIDENT SHARED I FEEL 
LIKE I CAN AS WELL. 
HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT -- 
AMERICA'S CONTINUED COMMITMENT 
TO ENSURE THAT ISRAEL WAS 
SECURE FROM THREATS IN SIR WHY 
AS WELL. 
THAT TOPIC WAS DISCUSSED BY 
THEM AS WELL. 
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS  
>> THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN 
U.S. POLICY WITH RESPECT TO OUR 
ACTIVITIES IN SYRIA. 
I UNDERSTAND. 
THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION. 
>> IT IS WHAT MATTERS. 
IT IS WHAT MATTERS. 
WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAS DIRECTED US TO DO THE 
FOLLOWING THE MEETING WITH 
VLADIMIR PUTIN AND WHAT HE TOLD 
THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP TEAM TO 
DO AND HOW HE WANTS US TO 
DEPLOY HIS FOREIGN POLICY 
STRATEGY. 
>> DO YOU KNOW IF THE FROZEN 
STABILIZATION FUNDS FOR SYRIA, 
$200 MILLION, WAS THAT EVER 
DISCUSSED? 
>> THERE HAS BEEN -- WE ARE 
STILL WORKING TO REVIEW THAT 
POLICY. 
THAT IS A STATE DEPARTMENT 
POLICY. 
WE ARE REVIEWING IT. 
IT WAS THE SAME THE DAY BEFORE 
AS IT WAS THE DAY AFTER THE 
PRESIDENT'S MEETING WITH 
VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
>> DO YOU KNOW IF IRAN WAS 
REFERENCED IN THE CONTEXT OF 
SYRIA IN THEIR DISCUSSIONS? 
>> AGAIN, IT IS NOT FOR ME TO 
DISCLOSE THE CONTENTS OF THOSE 
CONVERSATIONS. 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT EACH TIME I 
HAVE SPOKEN WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, BOTH BEFORE THE HELSINKI 
SUMMIT AND AFTER, IRAN HAS BEEN 
A CENTRAL POINT THAT WE HAVE 
FOCUSED ON WITH RESPECT TO U.S. 
POLICY IN SYRIA. 
I AM CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL 
REMAIN SO. 
>> SO IN AN INTERVIEW, THE 
GENERAL WAS ASKED ABOUT WHETHER 
A DEAL HAD BEEN MADE IN SYRIA 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, AND HE SAID, AS 
YOU INDICATED, THAT HE HAD 
RECEIVED NO INSTRUCTIONS TO 
CHANGE WHAT HE IS DOING.  
HE WENT FURTHER ON TO SAY, AND 
I QUOTE, I WOULD WANT TO MAKE 
SURE THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING 
THAT WE STEPPED INTO LIGHTLY. 
I AM NOT RECOMMENDING THAT, AND 
THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY BIG STEP 
AT THIS POINT. 
IN RESPONSE TO HIS COMMENTS, 
THE RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE 
PUT OUT A STATEMENT AND ALSO 
POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND, 
AGAIN, I AM QUOTING THE RUSSIAN 
MEDIA. 
THEY SAY MINISTRY, I MEAN. 
WITH HIS STATEMENT, THE GENERAL 
NOT ONLY DISCREDITED THE 
OFFICIAL POSITION OF HIS 
SUPREME COMMANDER IN CHIEF BUT 
ALSO IS ESTIMATED THAT THE 
ILLEGALITY UNDER INTERNATIONAL 
LAW AND U.S. LAW OF THE 
MILITARY PRESENCE OF AMERICAN 
SERVICE AND IN SYRIA. 
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT OUR 
RESPONSE HAS BEEN TO THE 
RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE 
WITH RESPECT TO THIS STATEMENT? 
>> SENATOR, I GUESS THE 
RESPONSE WOULD BE MOST 
APPROPRIATE FROM THE DEPARTMENT 
OF DEFENSE AND NOT FROM THE 
DEPARTMENT OF STATE. 
BUT I WILL HUMBLY SUGGEST TO 
YOU THAT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE MORE 
CONFIDENCE IN THE GENERAL THAN 
THE RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF 
DEFENSE. 
>> I DO HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IN 
THAT STATEMENT AND THAT IS WHY 
I AM RAISING THIS QUESTION, 
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT OUR 
RESPONSE TO THE RUSSIAN 
MINISTRY OF DEFENSE OUGHT TO BE 
VERY STRONG TO SAY, THEY HAVE 
NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT WHAT OUR 
GENERALS ARE DOING IN SYRIA. 
THAT IS NOT THEIR BUSINESS. 
THAT IS OUR BUSINESS. 
I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT IS A 
POINT THAT WE MAKE VERY 
STRONGLY. 
I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT 
SYRIA A LITTLE OVER TWO WEEKS 
AGO. 
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE 
WORK THAT OUR MILITARY HAS BEEN 
DOING IN NORTHEAST SYRIA ALONG 
THE TURKISH BORDER. 
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE 
WORK OF THE SYRIAN DEMOCRATIC 
FORCES, AND WHAT I HAVE HEARD 
OVER AND OVER AGAIN, BOTH FROM 
THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT WERE 
STARVING AND FROM THE 
CIVILIANS, SYRIAN CIVILIANS, ON 
THE GROUND WAS, PLEASE DON'T 
LEAVE US HERE TO THE FATE OF 
EITHER A SIDE OR THE RUSSIANS 
OR OTHER FORCES THAT MAY COME 
INTO THAT PART OF CEREAL. 
AND PLEASE, JUST A LITTLE BIT 
AND HELP FOR RECONSTRUCTION 
EFFORTS WOULD GO A VERY LONG 
WAY. 
THAT PART OF SYRIA HAS 
STABILIZED. 
THEY ARE INTO RECONSTRUCTION. 
THEY ARE SENDING BACK PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE BEEN DISPLACED TO 
THEIR HOMES AND IT WOULD BE, I 
BELIEVE, A REALLY TERRIBLE 
REVERSAL OF POLICY FOR US TO 
LEAVE THOSE FOLKS AFTER WHAT WE 
HAVE DONE AND TO TURN THEM OVER 
TO THE RUSSIANS OR TO THE 
SYRIAN FORCES. 
>>> SENATOR, IF I MIGHT, JUST 
SO THE FACTS ARE CLEAR, THE 
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IS THE 
ONE THAT ENABLED RUSSIA TO HAVE 
THE CAPACITY THAT THEY HAVE IN 
SYRIA TODAY. 
BUT I AM NOT DEFENDING AT THE 
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION, MR. 
SECRETARY BUT I WANT THIS 
ADMINISTRATION TO CONTINUE WHAT 
IS WORKING. 
THAT YOU ARE ADVOCATING FOR THE 
CONTINUATION OF THIS 
ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY. 
I THINK THAT THAT IS IMPORTANT 
FOR EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND. 
>> SENATOR FLAKE. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN AND 
SECRETARY FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. 
I WANT TO COMMEND THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT FOR QUICK STATEMENTS 
WITH REGARD TO THE NATURE OF 
THE CONVERSATION AS IT WAS 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT PUTIN AND 
PRESIDENT TRUMP REGARDING 
CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS LIKE MR. 
McCALL AND OTHERS TRAVELING TO 
RUSSIA TO BE INTERROGATED BY 
THE RUSSIANS. 
THE STATE DEPARTMENT CAME OUT 
AND SAID IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE 
DESPITE THE PRESIDENT'S 
STATEMENT THAT SAID THAT THERE 
WAS AN INCREDIBLE OFFER. 
IT TOOK THE WHITE HOUSE EIGHT 
-- A FULL THREE DAYS TO 
CONTRADICT THAT STATEMENT THAT 
PRESIDENT PUTIN HAD MADE, BUT 
THE STATE DEPARTMENT QUICKLY 
SAID THAT IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE. 
SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. 
>> SENATOR FLAKE, YOU GIVE ME A 
LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH CREDIT. 
I AM DOING MY LEVEL BEST EVERY 
DAY TO IMPLEMENT THE 
PRESIDENT'S POLICIES AND THAT 
STATEMENT WAS FROM THE UNITED 
STATES PRESIDENT'S STATE 
DEPARTMENT. 
>> OKAY. 
BY THE UNITED STATES PRESIDENT 
SAID THAT IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE 
OFFER AND SO THAT IS WHY I 
POINT OUT THE DIFFERENCE IN 
COMMENDING YOU. 
PLEASE TAKE IT. 
WITH REGARD TO WHAT ELSE WAS 
SAID DURING THAT MEETING, I 
KNOW THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN SOME 
INDICATION ABOUT WHAT WAS 
DISCUSSED. 
LET ME JUST GIVE A SENSE OF HOW 
RUSSIA IS CHARACTERIZING THAT 
MEETING. 
THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE 
PRIVATE MEETING LIKE THIS. 
MANY OF US VOICE STRONG 
CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING A PRIVATE 
MEETING LIKE THIS WITH NO 
READOUT. 
OFFICIALLY. 
FOR WHAT HAPPENED. 
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A 
PRIVATE MEETING LIKE THAT IS 
HELPING VLADIMIR PUTIN'S 
MEETING WITH DONALD TRUMP WAS, 
QUOTE, BETTER THAN SUPER. 
RUSSIA'S TOP DIPLOMAT HAS SET 
THE LEADER SUMMIT IN HELSINKI 
WAS FABULOUS. 
THAT WAS LAB OR OFF WHO ALSO 
SAID THAT. 
THE REMARKS REPORTED BY THE 
RUSSIAN NEWS AGENCY SUMMED UP 
THE MOOD THAT DONALD TRUMP 
SIDED WITH THE KREMLIN OVER HIS 
OWN INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, SO 
THEY ARE REPORTING THAT AS WELL.
HERE IS HOW ONE NEWSPAPER IN 
RUSSIA CHARACTERIZED IT. 
DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED TO 
DOMINATE VLADIMIR PUTIN ANOTHER 
TABLOID SAID A QUIET, MODEST 
DONALD TRUMP HAS PALED IN 
COMPARISON WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
IT IS CLEAR THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN 
HAS OUTMANEUVERED THE U.S. 
PRESIDENT. 
THAT IS THE RUSSIAN MEDIA, 
úCHA 
AND WE HAVE NO READOUT TO 
DISPUTE ANY OF IT. 
ALL WE HAVE ARE THE STATEMENTS 
BY THE PRESIDENT THAT THEY HAVE 
MADE AN INCREDIBLE OFFER, FOR 
EXAMPLE, TO HAVE THE FORMER 
U.S. DIPLOMATS SHIPPED OFF TO 
RUSSIA TO BE INTERROGATED. 
I AM GLAD TO HEAR THAT, ONE, A 
LITTLE BIT MORE TIME WILL BE 
HAD BEFORE A NEW MEETING TAKES 
PLACE BETWEEN THE TWO. 
BY THE WAY, I THINK IT IS GOOD 
THAT OUR PRESIDENT OF THE 
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT SPEAK AND ME 
TOGETHER. 
THAT IS A GOOD THING. 
I DO NOT THINK IT IS A GOOD 
THING TO MEET IN PRIVATE WITH 
ONLY AN INTERPRETER PRESENT 
WITH ALL -- WITH NO READOUT SO 
THAT WHATEVER IS CHARACTERIZED 
IS ONLY CHARACTERIZED BY THE 
RUSSIAN SIDE, SO ANY RESPONSE 
OR THOUGHTS ON THAT? 
>> SO I HAVE A PERSONAL 
EXPERIENCE. 
I HAD A PRIVATE CONVERSATION 
WITH NORTH KOREANS. WE DID NOT 
ISSUE A READOUT ON THE 
CONVERSATIONS. 
QUITE INTENTIONALLY. 
AND THE NORTH KOREAN PRESS 
CHOSE TO CHARACTERIZE IT BUT WE 
THOUGHT IT WAS IN AMERICA'S 
BEST INTEREST NOT TO RESPOND TO 
FOR TAT ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE 
CONVERSATION. 
WE KNEW THE TRUTH. 
WE KNEW WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE 
THERE. 
AND IT IS THE NORTH KOREAN 
PRESS AND SO I ASSUME THAT MOST 
REASONABLE PEOPLE WILL DISCOUNT 
IT FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY THE 
SAME THAT THE -- ONE MIGHT THE 
RUSSIAN PRESS. 
THESE ARE IMPORTANT DECISIONS 
ABOUT HOW MUCH TO DISCLOSE 
ABOUT PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS THAT 
WERE HAD BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS 
THAT YOU MAY HAVE AN 
EXPECTATION THAT YOU WILL HAVE 
ANOTHER PRIVATE CONVERSATION 
ONE DAY AND THE ABSENCE OF 
THEIR BELIEF THAT THAT PRIVATE 
CONVERSATION HAS THE CAPACITY 
TO REMAIN IN THAT BASE REDUCES 
THE FREEDOM TO HAVE THOSE 
CONVERSATIONS. 
I KNOW YOU HAVE HAD THIS IN 
YOUR LIFE. 
YOU HAVE HAD PRIVATE 
CONVERSATIONS AND YOU VALUE 
THEM. 
IT WAS JUST YOU AND SOMETHING 
ELSE IN THE ROOM AND WAS 
IMPORTANT AND YOU DID NOT GIVE 
ANYONE A READOUT. 
YOU WANTED TO HAVE THE CHANCE 
TO DO THAT AGAIN BECAUSE YOU 
THOUGHT YOU COULD MAKE REAL 
PROGRESS WITH THAT PERSON. 
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT NORTH 
KOREA. 
YOU BROUGHT IT UP. 
YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU TRAVELED 
TO NORTH KOREA TO CONTINUE ON, 
AS YOU PUT IT, TO FOLLOW UP ON 
COMMITMENTS MADE IN SINGAPORE. 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE 
COMMITMENTS FOR A MINUTE. 
YOU MENTIONED THAT THEY HAVE 
COMMITTED TO DENUCLEARIZATION. 
THEY MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT 
READOUT THAN WE DO ON WHAT THAT 
ENTAILS. 
BUT SO FAR, THEY SEEM TO BE 
WALKING BACK ANY COMMITMENT, 
REAL COMMITMENT, THAT WAS MADE 
THERE. 
WHAT COMMITMENT, FIRM 
COMMITMENT, OTHER THAN 
DISCUSSION OF RETURNING 
REMAINS? 
I AM NOT DISCOUNTING THAT. 
IN TERMS OF DENUCLEARIZATION, 
WHAT REAL COMMITMENTS WERE 
MADE? 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO 
THE PRIVATE COMMITMENTS THAT 
HAVE BEEN SHARED. 
I DO NOT THINK IT IS FAIR TO 
CHARACTERIZE THEM WALKING BACK 
FROM COMMITMENTS. 
REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE. 
RIGHT? 
IT ALL DEPENDS WHAT YOU DRAW AS 
THE PROJECTED LINE TO SAY ARE 
WE IN A BETTER PLACE OR A WORSE 
PLACE THAN WE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
ABSENT THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT? 
ONE CAN DRAW A COUNTERFACTUAL 
REFERENCE AND WE WILL NEVER 
KNOW WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN. 
I WILL CONCEDE THAT THERE IS AN 
AWFUL LONG WAY TO GO. 
I'M NOT TRYING TO OVERSELL THE 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE HAVE 
HAD TO THE PATH OF 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
THERE REMAINS A GREAT DEAL OF 
WORK TO DO. 
IT WILL BE HIGHLY CONTESTED. 
THE MODALITIES, THE MEANS, THE 
TIMING IS -- I AM CONFIDENT WE 
WILL BE DISCUSSING FOR A PERIOD 
OF TIME. 
TERE HAVE BEEN PUBLIC REPORTS 
AND I KNOW THE UNITED STATES IS 
TRACKING THE DISASSEMBLY OF A 
MISSILE ENGINE TEST SITE. 
SOMETHING THAT CHAIRMAN KIM 
COMMITTED ORALLY. 
IT WAS NOT IN THE WRITTEN 
AGREEMENT ITSELF, BUT THE 
CHAIRMAN COMMITTED IN HIS 
CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP TO DO. 
THEY ARE BEGINNING TO DISMANTLE 
THAT. 
THAT HAS TO DO WITH THEIR 
MISSILE PROGRAM. 
IT IS A GOOD THING. 
STEPS FORWARD. 
>> THANK YOU. 
QUICKLY BEFORE THE TIME IS 
OUTCOMES SOMETHING COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT. 
THE COUNTRY RWANDA RIGHT NOW, 
AND YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH 
THIS BECAUSE OF THIS WEEK'S 
FOCUS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AS 
INDICATED A MOVE TOWARDS SEVERE 
RESTRICTIONS ON RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM, PARTICULARLY FROM OUT 
WIDE GROUPS. 
WHAT ARE THE PLANS OF THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT TO LET THEM KNOW 
THAT IT IS NOT IN THEIR OWN 
INTEREST NOR OURS? 
SENATOR, I SHARE YOUR CONCERNS. 
I WILL NEED TO GET BACK TO IN 
TERMS OF WHAT ACTIONS -- I KNOW 
THAT WE WILL CALL IT OUT. 
I KNOW THAT WE WILL LABEL IT 
FOR WHAT IT IS. 
WE DO NEED TO SEE -- IT IS 
TRAGIC. 
ANYWAY. 
I SHARE YOUR CONCERNS. 
IT IS A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR US. 
>> THANK YOU. 
SENATOR CAN'T. 
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIR AND MR. 
SECRETARY. 
A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS. 
I WAS VERY DISCOURAGED AT THE 
HELSINKI SUMMIT WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT BASICALLY WAS OFFERED 
A CHOICE IN SOME OF THE 
QUESTIONS THAT HE BELIEVED U.S. 
INTEL OR DID HE BELIEVE THAT 
VLADIMIR PUTIN'S PROTESTATIONS 
THAT HE HAD ENGAGED IN HACKING 
OF THE ELECTION AND HE 
BASICALLY SAID MY OWN PEOPLE 
HAVE MADE A GREAT CASE TO ME. 
VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS MADE A GREAT 
CASE TO ME AND I DO NOT SEE WHY 
RUSSIA WOULD HAVE DONE THIS. 
HE CAME BACK AND CORRECTED IT 
THE NEXT DAY IN THE UNITED 
STATES BUT AT THE END HE SAID I 
BELIEVE MY INTEL COMMUNITY BUT 
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT 
THERE AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN 
SOMEONE ELSE. 
THIS DRAGGED ON FOR A COUPLE OF 
DAYS. 
YOU KNOW WHERE I LIVE. 
YOU KNOW I HAVE A LOT OF 
CONSTITUENTS THAT USED TO BE 
EMPLOYEES AT THE CIA. 
PEOPLE COME UP TO ME VIRGINIA 
AND SAY THAT I AM WITH THE IC 
AND THEY ARE VERY DEMORALIZED 
BY THIS. 
THEY HAD TO MORALIZE THEM WHEN 
STANDING NEXT TO VLADIMIR 
PUTIN, THE PRESIDENT'S WORDS 
WERE TO SUGGEST THAT HE TRUSTED 
VLADIMIR PUTIN OVER THEM. 
THERE WAS THE SUGGESTION WHEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THAT IT 
WAS AN INCREDIBLE OFFICE -- 
OFFER, THAT HE WAS ALSO 
POTENTIALLY WILLING TO THROW 
NOT JUST THE INTEL FOLKS UNDER 
THE BUS BUT THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT DIPLOMATS UNDER THE 
BUS THAT LIVE IN VIRGINIA, TOO. 
THEY FEEL THE DEMORALIZATION 
ABOUT YOUR COMMONS TODAY THAT 
WE ARE GOING TO GO TO BAT FOR A 
CURRENT REFORMER. 
THAT IS VERY, VERY HELPFUL. 
WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT IS 
OUR MILITARY. 
OUR MILITARY LEADERSHIP. 
THERE WAS AN ARTICLE YESTERDAY 
IN THE WASHINGTON POST. 
GENERAL JOSEPH F DUNFORD, 
CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINTS OF 
STOCK, AS OF MONDAY, HAD NOT 
BEEN BRIEFED ON HELSINKI EVEN 
THOUGH IT DIRECTLY AFFECTS MORE 
THAN 1 MILLION TREAT -- TROOPS 
OVERSEAS BUT DO YOU KNOW WHY 
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO 
BRIEFING OF GENERAL DUNFORD 
ABOUT THE DISCUSSIONS THAT TOOK 
PLACE? 
>> YOU HAVE TO ASK THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OR 
CHAIRMAN DUNFORD. 
>>> YOU DO NOT DISPUTE -- YOU 
HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE 
WAS A BRIEFING OF GENERAL 
DUNFORD TODAY ABOUT THE 
HELSINKI DISCUSSION? 
DO YOU? 
YOU READ ME A PIECE FROM THE 
WASHINGTON POST. 
>>> I AM ASKING YOUR KNOWLEDGE. 
DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE THAT 
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SHARED 
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT U.S. RUSSIA 
MILITARY ISSUES WITH THE JOINT 
CHIEFS OF STAFF? 
I HAVE SPOKEN WITH CHAIRMAN 
DUNFORD ABOUT IT. 
I WAS WITH HIM YESTERDAY. 
WE HAD A CHANCE TO HAVE A 
CONVERSATION ABOUT IT. 
YES. 
ABOUT OUR PLANS. 
ABSOLUTELY. 
>> YESTERDAY MAY HAVE BEEN THE 
FIRST TIME HE WAS BRIEFED ABOUT 
IT. 
>> THAT IS POSSIBLE. 
TONIGHT I WAS GOING TO ASK 
ABOUT THE GENERAL. 
THE INFORMATION THAT THE 
SENATOR MENTIONED EARLIER. 
HE EXPRESSED WARINESS ABOUT 
WORKING WITH RUSSIA AND THE 
RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY. 
THIS IS AN INTERESTING 
STATEMENT. 
THEY WENT AFTER GENERAL HOTEL, 
WHO OVERSEES, AS YOU KNOW, THE 
U.S. MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST INCLUDING SYRIA AND 
WITH HIS STATEMENTS THE GENERAL 
NOT ONLY DISCREDITED THE 
OFFICIAL POSITION OF HIS 
SUPREME COMMANDER IN CHIEF -- 
ARE YOU AWARE OF WHAT THE 
OFFICIAL POSITION IS THAT IS 
BEING REFERENCED IN THAT 
STATEMENT?. 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO SPEAK WITH 
THE RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE 
TO NOW. 
>> YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY WE 
ARE CONCERNED IF IT IS BEING 
REPORTED IN RUSSIAN PRESS AS 
THEY HAVE SAID THAT THEY ARE 
TALKING ABOUT OFFICIAL 
POSITIONS THAT THE PRESIDENT 
HAS OUTLINED. 
AS FAR AS YOU KNOW, THE 
STATEMENTS DID NOT VIOLATE ANY 
OFFICIAL POSITION OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
>>> YOU SEEM TO BE GIVING A 
GREAT DEAL OF CREDIT TO THE 
RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE. 
>> I MIGHT NOT SHARE THAT SAME. 
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT JOSEPH 
HOTEL. 
YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OF 
THE STATEMENTS THAT HE MADE 
INCLUDING THOSE THAT WE READ 
VIOLATE ANY POSITION OF UNITED 
STATES? 
>> IF YOU WOULD, IT IS BEST TO 
APPROACH THE GENERAL AND THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. 
WE ARE THREE ORDERS REMOVED. 
>>> IF I COULD INTRODUCE, THERE 
IS AN INTERESTING ARTICLE IN 
BUZZFEED NUDE -- NEWS TODAY 
THAT LISTS HEADLINES AND THESE 
ARE INSTRUCTIVE. 
THE DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCEMENT 
THAT HE WILL END THE U.S. KOREA 
DRILLS CATCHES THE PENTAGON 
OFFGUARD. 
THEY ARE SURPRISED BY THE 
PLEDGE TO HALT MILITARY 
EXERCISES. 
THE PENTAGON CAUGHT OFF GUARD 
BY THE SPACE FORCE 
ANNOUNCEMENT. 
DONALD TRUMP SIGNALS 
WITHDRAWAL. 
SURPRISING THE PENTAGON AND THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT. 
THE PENTAGON CAUGHT BY SURPRISE 
PUSHES FOR IRAQ IS TO GET 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATION. 
U.S. ADJOINT SHEET THE 
BLINDSIDED BY DONALD TRUMP'S 
TRANSGENDER -- NORTH, CAUGHT 
OFFGUARD IS PRESIDENT TRUMP 
INTRODUCES TROOPS. 
IF I COULD INTRODUCE FOR THE 
RECORD. 
I WORRY ABOUT AN ADMINISTRATION 
THAT WOULD TAKE UP VLADIMIR 
PUTIN POSITION OVER THE INTEL 
COMMUNITY AND THE 
ADMINISTRATION THAT WOULD 
SUGGEST THAT IT MIGHT BE A 
GREAT DEAL TO CONSIDER HANDING 
OVER A FORMER DIPLOMAT FOR 
QUESTIONING. 
I WORRY ABOUT THE 
ADMINISTRATION THAT IS CATCHING 
THE PENTAGON OFFGUARD. 
THAT IS NOT CONSULTING WITH 
JENNA FOR -- GENERAL DUNFORD OR 
BRIEFING HIM A WEEK AFTER A 
SUMMIT OF THIS IMPORTANCE TO 
OUR MILITARY. 
MR. SECRETARY, YOU ARE AWARE OF 
THE BAN, THE CURRENT BAN  ON 
RUSSIAN AND MILITARY -- AND 
U.S. JOINT MILITARY OPERATIONS. 
ARE YOU NOT? 
>> I AM AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE 
OF THAT PROVISION. 
YES. 
>> THE PROVISION BANS ANY USE 
OF FUNDS. 
IT IS IN THE NDA. 
ANY USE OF FUNDS TO SUPPORT 
JOINT RUSSIA AND U.S. MILITARY 
OPERATIONS.  
IT GIVES THE SECRETARY OF 
DEFENSE THE ABILITY TO 
UNDERTAKE A NATIONAL SECURITY 
WAIVER IF HE THINKS THAT IT IS 
THE RIGHT IDEA. 
DOES THE ADMINISTRATION ACCEPT 
THE LEGALITY AND BINDING NATURE 
OF THAT PROVISION OF LAW? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK THAT THE 
DOD GENERAL COUNSEL IS THE 
RIGHT PERSON TO ASK ABOUT THE 
INTRICACIES OF THE PROVISION 
THAT HAD TO DO WITH COMPLEX 
ISSUES THAT SPAN THE GAP 
BETWEEN, I THINK OF WHAT YOU'RE 
GETTING BETWEEN THE COMPLETION 
AND COORDINATION. 
IT IS A COMPLEX UNDERTAKING. 
NOT A WAIVER THAT THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT HAS THE AUTHORITY. 
BROADLY, YES, THIS 
ADMINISTRATION FOLLOWS THE LAW 
OF THAT IS THE QUESTION. 
>>> YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF A 
LEGAL CONCERN THAT THE 
ADMINISTRATION HAS ABOUT THIS 
NDA PROVISION, ARE YOU? 
I AM NOT. 
>> YOU ARE NOT AWARE -- 
>> WE WANT TO BREAK OUT OF THIS 
HEARING.
