1
00:00:00,296 --> 00:00:00,696
FINAL HOUR.

2
00:00:00,696 --> 00:00:02,865
BRIAN: I'M AFRAID IF WE STAY ON

3
00:00:02,865 --> 00:00:04,500
THE SHOT THE WRONG FINGER WILL

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,136
POP UP AND I WILL HAVE TO

5
00:00:07,136 --> 00:00:07,837
APOLOGIZE.

6
00:00:07,837 --> 00:00:09,538
STEVE: I DON'T THINK THAT WILL

7
00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:09,872
HAPPEN.

8
00:00:09,872 --> 00:00:13,809
GERALDO RIVERA WILL JOIN US NOW.

9
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:16,379
>> NICE TO SEE THE PALMETTO

10
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,348
QUEEN BACK IN HER ENVIRONMENT.

11
00:00:19,348 --> 00:00:21,384
STEVE: LOOKS AFTER AFTER 53, 55

12
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:24,153
YEARS OF HOSTILITIES NORTH AND

13
00:00:24,153 --> 00:00:25,888
SOUTH KOREA ARE OFFICIALLY IN

14
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:27,623
THE NEXT YEAR GOING TO DECLARE

15
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:30,626
AN END TO THE KOREAN WAR,

16
00:00:30,626 --> 00:00:31,026
GERALDO.

17
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:33,763
>> IT IS FANTASTIC APPARENT

18
00:00:33,763 --> 00:00:34,196
BREAKTHROUGH.

19
00:00:34,196 --> 00:00:35,865
I DON'T WANT TO BE NAIVE ABOUT

20
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:36,132
IT.

21
00:00:36,132 --> 00:00:38,033
I DON'T WANT TO PRETEND WE

22
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:41,437
HAVEN'T HAD FALSE STARTS BEFORE

23
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:45,074
BUT WHEN YOU CONSIDER SEVERAL

24
00:00:45,074 --> 00:00:48,978
MONTHS AGO, IT WAS LITTLE

25
00:00:48,978 --> 00:00:51,480
"ROCKET MAN" AND THREATENING

26
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,350
SHOOTING ICBMs AND THREATENING

27
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,786
HE COULD REACH SEATTLE AND

28
00:00:56,786 --> 00:00:57,186
NORTHBOUND.

29
00:00:57,186 --> 00:00:59,054
HE KEPT EVOLVING, SENT MISSILES

30
00:00:59,054 --> 00:00:59,889
OVER JAPAN.

31
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:01,891
LOOK WHERE WE ARE NOW.

32
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:04,160
A FANTASTIC APPARENT

33
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,361
BREAKTHROUGH, I KEEP MODIFYING

34
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:09,698
IT I WAS THERE IN THE EARLY

35
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:12,134
'80s WHEN THEY HAD A

36
00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:13,836
REPROACHMENT NOT QUITE AS

37
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:14,670
TRAMATIC LIKE THIS.

38
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,207
NOT CROSSING OVER THE DMZ INTO

39
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:18,808
SOUTH KOREA.

40
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:19,809
STEVE: THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED

41
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:20,676
THIS MORNING.

42
00:01:20,676 --> 00:01:22,077
IT IS AMAZING.

43
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:23,779
>> I LOVE THEY'RE DOING

44
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:25,347
TELEVISED REUNIONS OF FAMILIES

45
00:01:25,347 --> 00:01:28,050
DIVIDED BY THE WAR.

46
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,619
FORMAL TREATY DECLARING END TO

47
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:31,320
THE WAR.

48
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,589
ABBY: LOOK AT TIMING, MIKE

49
00:01:33,589 --> 00:01:35,624
POMPEO, WE HAVE PHOTOS COMING IN

00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:37,827
THE NEWSROOM OF HIS MEETING WITH

51
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:39,562
KIM JONG-UN BUT ALSO PRESIDENT

52
00:01:39,562 --> 00:01:41,297
TRUMP, THAT MEETING JUST A FEW

53
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:42,164
WEEKS AWAY.

54
00:01:42,164 --> 00:01:45,267
HE TWEETED ABOUT THIS MORNING.

55
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:46,969
THREE TWEETS WHAT IS GOING ON IN

56
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:47,269
KOREA.

57
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:49,238
AFTER A FURIOUS YEAR OF MISSILE

58
00:01:49,238 --> 00:01:50,973
LAUNCHES AND NUCLEAR TESTING

59
00:01:50,973 --> 00:01:52,241
HISTORIC MEETING BETWEEN NORTH

60
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:53,976
AND SOUTH KOREA IS TAKING PLACE.

61
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:55,211
GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING BUT

62
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:56,378
ONLY TIME WILL TELL.

63
00:01:56,378 --> 00:01:57,580
KOREAN WAR TO END.

64
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,215
UNITED STATES AND ALL OF ITS

65
00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:00,115
GREAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE PROUD OF

66
00:02:00,115 --> 00:02:02,618
WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN KOREA.

67
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:05,187
FINALLY SAYS, PLEASE DO NOT

68
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:07,423
FORGET THE GREAT HELP MY GOOD

69
00:02:07,423 --> 00:02:09,324
FRIEND PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA,

70
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:10,860
GOOD POINT, PARTICULARLY AT

71
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,094
BORDER OF NORTH KOREA.

72
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:13,729
WITHOUT HIM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A

73
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:16,398
MUCH LONGER, TOUGHER PROCESS.

74
00:02:16,398 --> 00:02:18,968
THEY MENTION CHINA, THEY GET

75
00:02:18,968 --> 00:02:19,802
LOST IN THE CONVERSATION.

76
00:02:19,802 --> 00:02:21,370
THEY MIGHT BE THE MOST IMPORTANT

77
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,939
PIECE BEHIND THE ENTIRE PUZZLE.

78
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:25,241
>> ABSOLUTELY.

79
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:26,375
MEASURED TRAFFIC ON BRIDGE

80
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,077
BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND CHINA.

81
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:29,612
PRIME ARTERY OF SUPPLIES.

82
00:02:29,612 --> 00:02:31,080
IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE CHINESE

83
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,882
WERE ABIDING BY THE SANCTIONS.

84
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:35,918
AS THE SCREWS TIGHTENED ON KIM'S

85
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:38,320
REGIME, LISTEN I CAN'T SUPPORT

86
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,721
PEOPLE.

87
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:40,422
REMEMBER THE ONE SOLDIER RAN

88
00:02:40,422 --> 00:02:42,057
AWAY, FOUND ALL THE PARASITES IN

89
00:02:42,057 --> 00:02:44,560
HIS BELLY FROM MALNUTRITION AND

90
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,261
ALL REST OF IT.

91
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:49,698
COULD BE THE SITUATION GOT SO

92
00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:52,401
DIRE KIM FINALLY SAID, LET'S DO

93
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:54,503
THIS, OR COULD BE THE MOST

94
00:02:54,503 --> 00:02:55,671
ELABORATE SUBTERFUGE.

95
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:59,642
COULD BE LEADING US DOWN

96
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:00,809
PRIMROSE PATH.

97
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:01,744
HERE IS MY NUKE.

98
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:03,212
I WILL RATTLE ONE MORE TIME.

99
00:03:03,212 --> 00:03:04,914
BRIAN: INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE

100
00:03:04,914 --> 00:03:06,715
THAT THE LEGITIMATE MILITARY

101
00:03:06,715 --> 00:03:07,950
OPTION THAT GOT TO NORTH KOREA

102
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,452
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER LET THEM

103
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:13,422
UNDERSTAND THAT WE WERE SERIOUS

104
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:14,723
ALONG WITH THE WORDS THAT CAME

105
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:16,692
OUT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MOUTH.

106
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:22,531
HOWEVER, I THINK ABOUT OTTO WARM

107
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:25,901
WARM -- WARMBIER AND HIS FAMILY,

108
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,770
THEY ARE SUING THEM.

109
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,837
MARC SHORT, THE CHIEF

110
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:29,939
LEGISLATIVE ADVISOR THERE, HE

111
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:31,540
CAME OUT YESTERDAY, HAD NO

112
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,342
PROBLEM SAYING THIS IS HURT

113
00:03:33,342 --> 00:03:34,910
ROUSE REGIME.

114
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,478
WE HAVE OUR ICE OPEN.

115
00:03:36,478 --> 00:03:38,180
IF THE PRESIDENT SAID I DON'T

116
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,450
LIKE WHAT I HEAR I WILL GET UP.

117
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,985
I WANT EVERYONE IN CASE YOU WERE

118
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:44,720
NOT UP A COUPLE HOURS AGO, THIS

119
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,289
WAS UNSCRIPTED MOMENT BETWEEN

120
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:48,991
MOON AND KIM INTO THE SOUTH PART

121
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:53,629
OF THE KOREAN DIVIDE.

122
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:54,663
>> Translator: AND WE ARE

123
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:57,399
DECLARING A NEW ERA OF PEACE,

124
00:03:57,399 --> 00:04:00,102
BOTH OVER THE PAST DECADE WE

125
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:04,773
ENDURED THE TRAGEDY OF SECESSION

126
00:04:04,773 --> 00:04:07,343
BUT NOW WE ARE HERE TOGETHER

127
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:11,880
BECAUSE WE OVERCAME ALL THOSE

128
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,314
HARDSHIPS.

129
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:14,183
LET GOES FORWARD STEP BY STEP

130
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:16,017
FOR THE BRIGHT FUTURE TOGETHER.

131
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:19,021
I SINCERELY HOPE THIS

132
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:21,589
DECLARATION CAN SATISFY ALL OF

133
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,559
YOU WHO HAVE GOT HIGH

134
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:25,260
EXPECTATIONS AND ASPIRATIONS FOR

135
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,364
THE PEACE AND UNIFICATION.

136
00:04:28,364 --> 00:04:30,232
STEVE: THE BIG QUESTION,

137
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:31,400
GERALDO, APPARENTLY THEY HAVE

138
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,370
AGREED TO WORK TOGETHER TO

139
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,803
DENUCLEARIZE.

140
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:36,639
THE NORTH WOULD LIKE SOME, WILL

141
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,440
GO ALONG WITH SOME LIMITS.

142
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,743
THE UNITED STATES WANTS IT TO BE

143
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:41,110
COMPLETE.

144
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,977
>> REMEMBER THE RELATIONSHIP

145
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:43,278
USED TO EXIST BETWEEN

146
00:04:43,278 --> 00:04:45,447
NORTH KOREA AND LIBYA.

147
00:04:45,447 --> 00:04:46,682
GADHAFI WAS WELL DOWN THE ROAD

148
00:04:46,682 --> 00:04:48,450
TO DEVELOPING HIS OWN NUCLEAR

149
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:48,851
WEAPONS.

150
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:50,319
HE GAVE THEM UP BECAUSE HE

151
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,687
WANTED TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE

152
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:56,525
WEST AND WANTED IT FORMNALLIZE

153
00:04:56,525 --> 00:04:56,992
RELATIONS.

154
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:58,961
GADHAFI ENDED UP DEAD IN SEWER

155
00:04:58,961 --> 00:04:59,795
PIPE KILLED BY HIS HAD OWN

156
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:00,129
PEOPLE.

157
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:02,197
IF HE KEPT HIS NUKES, SOME ARGUE

158
00:05:02,197 --> 00:05:03,932
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE

159
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:05,768
INSULATED FROM THAT KIND OF

160
00:05:05,768 --> 00:05:06,135
REPRISAL.

161
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:08,070
THAT IS THE CAUTIONARY TALE FROM

162
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,004
KIM'S POINT OF VIEW.

163
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:11,140
DOES THAT MEAN HE CAN'T GO

164
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,473
FORWARD?

165
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:13,475
I THINK THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM

166
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:16,812
THERE IF HE FREEZES HIS, ALREADY

167
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:18,714
FROZEN, ALLOWING U.S. MILITARY

168
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:21,417
EXERCISES IN THE SOUTHERN, SOUTH

169
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:23,285
KOREA, SOUTHERN PART OF THE

170
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:23,719
PENINSULA.

171
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:25,220
HE HAS NOT COMPLAINED.

172
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,955
IT REALLY DOES SEEM TO ME THIS

173
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:27,556
IS DIFFERENT.

174
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:29,858
THIS HAS A VIBE OF HISTORY.

175
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:33,929
THIS REMINDS ME OF NIXON-CHINA,

176
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:34,229
1973.

177
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:35,364
ABBY: QUICKLY ON A HUMAN LEVEL.

178
00:05:35,364 --> 00:05:36,365
YOU'VE BEEN OVER THERE.

179
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:38,100
THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT DIED

180
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,935
DURING THE KOREAN WAR, BRINGING

181
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:41,904
FAMILIES TOGETHER, WHAT DOES

182
00:05:41,904 --> 00:05:43,605
TODAY, WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR SO

183
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:46,041
MANY PEOPLE THAT SUFFERED?

184
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,577
>> LET ME SAY AS A PROUD

185
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:51,013
PUERTO RICAN, THE MILITARY WAS

186
00:05:51,013 --> 00:05:52,548
SEGREGATED IN WORLD WAR II.

187
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:54,283
BY THE KOREAN WAR THEY WERE

188
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:54,683
INTEGRATED.

189
00:05:54,683 --> 00:05:56,685
