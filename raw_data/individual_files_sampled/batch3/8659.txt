Martha: TONIGHT WE ARE HEARING THAT THE PRESIDENT MAY HAVE ALREADY DECIDED WHO HE WANTS AS THE NEXT U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS TO BE. THAT'S ACCORDING TO BOB CORKER. INVESTOR NIKKI HALEY STUNNING EVERYONE BY RESIGNING YESTERDAY. SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM IS THE MEMBER OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHERE YOU HAVE SEEN HIM QUITE A BIT LATELY AND ALSO THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE. SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE WITH US. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE NIKKI HALEY RESIGNATION, THE DISCUSSION THAT PERHAPS THERE IS SOME SORT OF ARRANGEMENT WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND SHE'S GOING TO TAKE OVER YOUR SENATE SEAT? WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT ALL THAT? IT'S CRAZY. SHE DID A GREAT JOB. SHE WANTS TO SPEND TIME WITH HER FAMILY. SHE HAS HER KID GOING TO CLEMSON AND ANOTHER ONE GOING TO COLLEGE PRETTY SOON. SHE SERVED HER COUNTRY VERY WEL WELL. I WILL GIVE YOU 10-1 ODDS THAT IF I'M AN ATTORNEY GENERAL, WILL GIVE YOU $200 AND IF I'M NOT, I WILL GIVE YOU 20. I WILL TAKE ALL THOSE BETS ALL DAY LONG. Martha: YOU HAVE ZERO INTEREST. ZERO INTEREST. DOESN'T THAT LOOK LIKE AN ATTRACTIVE POSITION RIGHT NOW? I LOVE THE SENATE AND I THINK I CAN HELP THE PRESIDENT THERE AND HELP THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE I NEED TO BE AND WHERE I WANT TO BE AND IF THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH COUNTY KEEP ME I WILL RUN FOR REELECTION IN 2,020 AND KEEP DOING WHAT I'M DOING. DID THE PRESIDENT ASK YOU HIMSELF? NO. HE SAID IT, WHY ANYBODY LEAVE YOUR JOB TO DO WHAT YOU ARE
