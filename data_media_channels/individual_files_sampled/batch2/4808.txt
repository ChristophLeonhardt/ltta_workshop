for a year and a half this American presidency has been accused of nepotism lying vulgarity racism corruption and trading with the enemy and now from the country's top investigative reporter comes to charge the dus presidencies in the midst of a nervous breakdown these are an explosive new details about the Trump new White House today uncovered by veteran journalist Bob Woodward in his upcoming book entitled fear according to the Washington Post the book describes a nervous breakdown of the executive branch under this president and it portrays a White House consumed by the Muller probe quote Woodward depicts Trump's anger and paranoia about the Russia inquiry as unrelenting at times paralyzing the west wing for entire days former Trump lawyer John dead quote was convinced that president Trump would commit perjury have even taught the Special Counsel Robert mower so he quote staged a practice session to try to make his point last January quote Dowd peppered Trump with questions about the Russia investigation provoking stumbles contradictions and lies until the president eventually lost his cool quote this thing's a god damn hoax Trump erupting at the start of a 30 minute rant that finished with him saying I don't really want to testify well Woodward's account also reveals the trumps lawyers argued to mower that their clients testimony was a bad idea because it would make the president look like an idiot that was their defense John down reportedly told more last march quote I'm not going to sit there and let him look like an idiot and you published the transcript because everything leaks in Washington and the guys overseas are going to say I told you he was an idiot I told you as a goddamn dumbbell what are you dealing with this idiot for well separately dad warned the president quote don't testify it's either that or an orange jumpsuit you believe this stuff revealing the in fact responded to the revelations to the interview with a concern news site President Trump attacked the book of course and its authors saying it's just another bad book he's had a lot of credibility problems well Trump talk about credibility problems anyway Trump added I probably would have prepared this big them but maybe not I think it probably wouldn't have been a made a difference in the books he wanted to write a book a certain way well Woodward's book comes as a new Washington post/abc News poll shows that Democratic counties for Congress this fall have a big lead in the generic poll just two months outlet from the November elections 52% of Americans registered voters say if you like swear held today that favorite Democratic Congress candidate for the United States House represented in favor of Republican it's a 14-point Democratic advantage what do you think this what's gonna do the juice that joining me right now is Robert Costa who authored that report on the book in The Washington Post Jennifer Rubin watch The Post opinion writer you know he weaves the former Deputy Assistant Attorney General thank you for this a great pattern oh look at this Robert tell me about this book when you read it I said and you are a trump whisperer you know this guy you've covered as well as any any daily report there is out there and in there what did you make of what Woodward was able to get about Trump this idea of a nervous breakdown I hate an operation going haywire under pressure Chris working with my colleague Phil Rucker we went page by page throughout this book and you see so many advisers around this president pulling him back from different decisions on trade on national security on foreign policy expressing alarm to each other in private if not publicly but privately about how they think the president is going in the wrong direction but crazy stuff like not understanding why it's important that we get an early warning on a possible nuclear attack from North Korea the common-sense notion of the 7 second 7 second warning rather than a 15 minute warning it just seems the idea that we want to know immediately what happened not 15 minutes after the launch and this guy not seeming to understand the importance of that acute importance of time there are jarring scenes in the beginning of the book where the president's arguing against the South Korean trade agreement and then you have pages later Secretary of Defense mattis warning the president if you try to disrupt the South Korean relationship with the United States you could risk World War 3 from unfolding before our eyes if you try to unroll unwrapped some of those alliances that have been preserved for so long on trade on foreign policy you see madis the Secretary of Defense Gary Cohen the former top economic adviser trying to even pull documents off of the President's desk so he forgets about them and moves on this reminds me of that Twilight Zone episode where that little kid that evil little kid had powers to destroy anybody and they're all scared to death and that's what it sounds like Jennifer is that president with ultimate power and minimal intelligence exactly and you know this is all well and good that these guys are trying to leap around him and still think documents away from him and kind of patch things up but no one elected them president we have a president he was elected who is incapable of serving in the role and that's a real problems a problem for democracy it's a Washington Post it's coming out tomorrow the book reveals that that was close to the president constantly unnerved by Trump's behavior and our returning trying to prevent him from creating as you said Jennifer knew disasters former White House aide Rob Porter who left the mid allegations of domestic violence in his life is quoted as saying this was no longer a presidency this is no longer a White House this is a man being who he is well former economic adviser Gary Cohen came to regard Trump as a professional liar that's a quote by the way and chief of staff John Kelly reportedly called Trump unhinged that's a morose his word unhitch saying that the president stammered quote he's an idiot it's pointless to try to convince of anything he's going up the rails we're in crazy town I mean this is John Kelly look at it the general says we're in crazy town I don't even know why any of us are here this is the worst I've ever had well general Kelly later said the book is an attempt to smear people close to the pret okay here we go this is cover-up time I go back to my favorite quote from the perfume of scandal he would say that everybody says this after they get caught your thoughts Elliott right well the problem is this actionable can you take away somebody's car look like this if they had this kind of crazy stuff going on I don't think you can do that I wish you could take away the presidency from someone who's got this kind of crazy stuff going on the problem and just let's go big picture here is that you have the White House chief of staff and two of the four people in line for the presidency thinking that the president the United States is an idiot and saying it to other staff members and saying it amongst each and so on so it's it's who's in charge there and there seems like there's no faith in the in the in the head of the organization that's no way frankly to run a small business and frankly it's no way to run the executive branch of United I know you're careful on this and I respect you a lot for this but let's talk about this when the first word got out did Sarah parolin was actually going to be the nominee for vice president a major political party people began to talk to her and one of the great lines that came out of it I forget whether it was Steve Schmidt or was Nicole or somebody said she doesn't know anything I mean that was a profound statement it was almost funny in fact it was funny the fact that somebody can reach that level and not literally know anything about American history American government anything you might need to bring to the office what's your view of Trump and the question of idiocy what is the how is the word idiocy used here is it used Hyperloop that hyperbolically is it used as an anger or just in dismay after a bad incident when these people throw these words around and Bob Woodward picks them up in his reporting what do you make of an idiot idiot crazytown you've done the most one of the most revealing parts of this book is when the generals bring the President to the Pentagon to bring him across the river to try to teach him about world affairs and you see this throughout Woodward's book generals top advisers to the president trying to teach him about world order about US alliances about the importance of institutions and regardless of what you think of the president's intelligence Woodward's reporting shows a president who does not regard these relationships or alliances as important in disregarding so much of the council that's given to him by top military officials that comes through throughout the book well Woodward said he requests an interview with the president through was six different people at the White House but was ultimately unsuccessful in getting the president participate in the book at all however in a conversation last month with President Trump after the book was finished and going to the publisher the president said he did not receive any requests and said he would have liked to have been interviewed here are some audio excerpts from that call between Bob Woodward the great investigative reporter who really broke the Watergate story and the president states which were released by the way today by The Washington Post let's listen to that Congress Oh my diary we missed the opportunity to talk for the book well I just spoke with Kelly and she asked me if I if I got a call I never got a call I never got a message who did you who did you ask about speaking to me well about six people you know they don't tell me senator I talked to Kelly in about a two and a half weeks ago I would have liked to have done that and I maximized my effort run somehow it didn't get to you or it's really too bad because nobody told me about it and I would have loved to have spoken to you you know I'm very open to you I think you've always been fair but we'll see what happens you know it's a tough look at the world and your administration and you write well I assume that means it's going to be a negative book but you know I'm some sort of fifty percent used to that that's all right some are good and several bad sounds like there's gonna be a bad way Jennifer what do you make of that I mean why did the press think this calls for some analysis why would the president call if he know that he knows he's ignored all these requests through his staff to meet with Bob Woodward who is dangerous yeah we know it he spent he'll take a rape recorder into the room with you he will ask you tough questions so have them on tape when he walks out and you will be under his control at that point I mean the fact that he taped this conversation tells you that I mean this you should play just a small portion of that you couldn't possibly play the whole thing it would take up the whole show it's long it's rambling at times he seems to contradict himself he says you know Kelly you talked to Kelli Ann what Kelly Ann was one of the people he asked so he gets Kelly Ann on the phone and then Kelly Ann tries to blame it all on hope hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if
