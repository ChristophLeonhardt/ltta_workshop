if you're a driver what do you think your car tells people about your personality well researchers in the u.s. say they can determine almost everything about you even your political allegiances and all that using just Google Maps Jacqueline booga knows more scientists have been poring over Google Street view images eager to know what cars are in what neighborhoods why because apparently that's how you can reveal troves of demographic information about the area including race income and most importantly political persuasion sounds like blatant generalizing based on stereotypes but it turns out it's actually backed by statistics Stanford researchers took over 50 million images in 200 cities from Google Street View and compared the results of the presidential voting data it appears that if a street has a greater concentration of pickup trucks people there are more likely to swing to the Republican Party whereas those streets filled with Trustee sedans are probably casting ballots for the Democrats using easily obtainable visual data we can learn so much about our communities on par with some information that takes billions of dollars to obtained via census surveys so now you know what your car is saying about you behind your back but it doesn't stop there apparently certain food choices also give away your political leanings one study concluded that hamburgers and mozzarella sticks appealed to Republican taste buds while veggie burgers burritos and avocado salads are democratic foods and heaven forbid we leave out man's best friend apparently poodles and Yorkshire Terriers are the perfect companions for the Democrats leaving boxers and Border Collies for the Republicans that's also not a joke but an actual study well there are usually greens of truth and stereotypes this may just be pushing the limit how much science is there in political science or even in economics it's not really a hard science so yeah this study is getting a lot of attention it shouldn't so you really don't need to do this type of study to conclude that there's a highlight that somebody who owns a Prius might be a Democrat or somebody who owns a pickup truck might be a republic I mean it's it's really I think academic overkill it seems to me to be really an embarrassing piece of in quotes skull or fake scholarship
