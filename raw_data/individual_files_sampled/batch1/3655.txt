so right now we're trying to look for routes to go to the Grand Canyon but according to the navigation system here we're going to get there with negative 22 percent battery amount I'm will wet and I'm gram Flanagan this is what happened when we drove a Tesla across America all right that one wait wait wait wait my friend so right now we're trying to look for routes to go to the Grand Canyon but according to the navigation system here we're going to get there with negative 22 percent battery left which means we're screwed basically everywhere you want to go depends on the network of superchargers and it's funny because we're you know we're in a beautiful Tesla town and I'm like bitching about it and not being able to do that something that people in a Honda Civic could do today that they have the freedom to go to the Grand Canyon and we don't it's frustrating is there any learning that's in this this is what we're doing on our supercharger break boots and Ramnath deciding on which raw snacks you want I'm gonna get the tree nut Trail Mix baby no I had to say it like that we're just gonna drive through the northwestern corner of Arizona maybe try and get out and see something scenic there it's a shame that we can't see you know the main portion of the Grand Canyon shame what sucks it is it does and but I think that I think that we're about to head into romantic countryside this is the most spectacular scenery that we have seen on this trip a me is gonna be hard to top this this is like something straight out of West Graham had a little little accident here P what you do man I spilled my coffee on myself freaking lid was defective uh yeah that's that's what happened oh you're just gonna rub it in the Tesla GPS just led us to a supercharger station at st. George Utah so now we're just waiting here for like 15 20 minutes just waiting for this car to charge navigate to Fairfield Inn in Salt Lake City Utah see comes up with a whole list of hotels that's the right one up top and there are navigates so it's almost like it has its own version of Siri we are finally in Salt Lake City after a long day and it's about 12:30 in the morning it's been a long day but lots of charging yeah a lot of charging four separate trips in the supercharger station we have a long drive tomorrow but I'm excited about the countryside for sure so day two wrapped up more to come yeah all right Oh 70 in my 30 seconds
