Politico reveals bombshell new report about the left's treatment of anti feh under President Obama we will talk about that we will also be getting to Donald Trump giving a million dollars to hurricane Harvey victims and why the left is now desperate for the Russia investigation to pan out even more desperate than they were before I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show many of things to talk about today plus we're gonna get to the mailbag but before we do any of that first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Mack Weldon dot-com so Mack walden is better than whatever you are wearing right now they believe in smart design premium fabrics simple shopping they make underwear socks shirts under shirts hoodies sweat pants more more quality than you will ever wear the eyewear mech Weldon underwear and they are just super comfortable not only a super comfortable they're really durable you know you go out and you buy some cheap underwear and they fall apart in like five seconds you have to throw in the garbage map Wheldon underwear are super durable I've been wearing them not the same ones every day guys but I'm wearing Mac Walden underwear for months now and they feel the same as when they came out of the package they are also naturally antimicrobial which means that they eliminate odor they want you to be comfortable so if you don't like a first pair then you can keep it and they will still refund you no questions asked they perform well they look good you can wear it in you can wear it out when you go home I don't dress like this when I go home I actually get into comfortable clothes and I always put on my Mac welding gear that's the best gear you can have math Wheldon comm get 20% off using promo code Shapiro that's Mac Weldon comm use promo code Shapiro get 20% off again it spelled ma CK Weldon wel do and comm knack Wells and comm use that promo code Shapiro get 20% off and let them know that we sent you as well okay so president Trump he he made a statement yesterday that I was kind of surprised he hadn't done earlier actually he said that who's gonna give a bunch of money to the hurricane Harvey victims which makes an awful lot of sense the man's incredibly wealthy and Sarah Huckabee Sanders made that announcement yesterday and so here is what Sarah Huckabee Sanders had to say about it I had a chance to speak directly with the president earlier and I'm happy to tell you that he is would like to join in the efforts that a lot of the people that we've seen across this country do and he's pledging $1,000,000 of personal money to the fun and he's actually asked that I check with the folks in this room since you are very good at research and have been doing a lot of recording into the groups and organizations that have best and most effective in helping and providing aid and he'd love some suggestions from the folks here and I'd be happy to take those if any of you have them smart for a president Trump to do this obviously it's good PR it makes a lot of sense meanwhile the Democrats are looking at this and they're realizing that Trump's handling of hurricane Harvey's actually pretty good most Americans are gonna be pretty happy with how he has handled this natural disaster it's better frankly than I thought he was going to handle a natural disaster I thought his administration did a better job than I thought that they might do so I really have no major complaints with President Trump here I think that he's doing a pretty good job unifying the country around the hurricane Harvey victims again easy thing to unify around but I think that he's done a good job with it Democrats however are still focused on how do we stop Trump how do we stop the Republicans and so the way they're are attempting to do this is by painting the Republicans as divisive Bernie Sanders came out yesterday he says that he hopes the president's from stops dividing and also he hopes that someone will at some point give him finally after long last a pudding Cup preferably tapioca but if you do not have it he will also take vanilla he does not like chocolate go Bernie Sanders that in Houston right now people don't care whether you're black - you're white or you're Latino or you're gay or you're straight people are helping each other which is what this country is supposed to be about people in use that are coming together and hope Trump stops dividing up the American people okay so let's point something out it's not Trump at this point he's dividing the American people Trump is responding the way he's supposed to be responding and it's Sanders who is suggesting the divisions and when it comes to the divisive rhetoric stuff when it comes to the idea that Trump is the only one who's engaged in divisive rhetoric this is not what about ISM okay I've been very very critical of President Trump's rhetoric I've criticized him for not disassociating himself from the all right I think I've been pretty clear on this for the last two years at this point that I think a lot of President Trump's rhetoric is designed to divide rather than to unite and I don't like that part of his rhetoric that is designed to do that without actually naming an enemy you know so I've been clear about that that said the idea that the left is proposed that Trump is the divider and they are the great uniter this is absolute nonsense this is a report from Politico and it's an amazing report that's gonna go under notice today which is why we're gonna bring attention to it on this the most popular podcast on the right in America so here is the here's the story from Politico and they reported on Friday the federal government has been worrying about the rise of anti feh this is this leftist quasi domestic terror group since early 2016 now 2017 like most people became aware of an Tifa in 2017 when an Tifa burned a bunch of crap at AU nappa love speech at berkeley but an Tifa had been very active in 2016 they had engaged in violent riots in in Sacramento there was a riot in Sacramento we talked to a member of one of the groups that was attending that rallies a white supremacist reality they're a bunch of people who showed up to the corner unquote defend the rights of the white supremacists and Antipa showed up ready to do violence when this when this happened it was not covered by the media but that happened in the middle of 2016 in Sacramento at the State Capitol apparently the federal government has had reports on an Tifa since early 2016 even labeled their activities domestic terrorist violence do you remember Obama saying anything about it in 2016 anything did he say one word about antia or left-wing violence in 2016 no I didn't think so so we've got in two years of President Trump must disassociate himself from the all right and white supremacist violence of course I agree everyone should have no problem doing that right or left but the left including President Obama hasn't had to do anything until now right Nancy Pelosi gave a statement this week talking about how antifa was bad where were they last year why didn't they stop this thing when it was rising according to political quote previously unreported documents disclosed that by April 2016 authorities believe that anarchist extremists were the primary instigators of violence at public rallies against a range of targets okay again that language primary instigators it's an leftist played this is though it's a cycle of violence it's the white supremacist show up with a brick and the antiva people show up with a bat they go at each other it is an Tifa that has provokes these clashes and then a lot of these white supremacist groups a lot of zealot right groups show up and they look for violence as well but the ones who are instigating this largely are antifa that's not according to me that's according to the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security they were blamed by authorities for attacks on the police government and political institutions along with symbols of the capitalist system racism social and justice and fascism according to a confidential 2016 joint intelligence assessment by the DHS and the FBI the violence ratcheted up as president Trump's campaign and swung into full gear the FBI noted violence by an Tifa in Texas Oregon California law enforcement in particular focus on a white supremacist rally in Sacramento after Sacramento rally antiva protesters came looking for violence and quote engaged in several activities indicating proficiency in pre operational planning to include organizing carpools to travel from different locations raising bail money and preparation for arrests counter surveilling a law enforcement using three man's scout teams using handheld radios for communication coordinating the event via social media according to the DHS that's a planning that's planning's and just punch - spontaneous violence this is people on handheld radios learning each other when the cops are showing up they've raised bail money in anticipation of arrests they were organizing carpools to get to and from places they were organizing how to get weapons the FBI and DHS issued a report in April 2016 openly saying that Antipa was prepping for violence New Jersey law enforcement reportedly stated that an teef had cropped up in New York Chicago San Francisco and Philly shockingly some members of an Tifa quote have gone overseas to train and fight with fellow and artist organizations he sounds like a terror cell going overseas to train and fight with anarchist organization so here is the question this was happening in the middle of 2016 where the hell was President Obama and the violence in Charlottesville President Trump was asked repeatedly as well he should have been denounced this violence and he did repeatedly denounced the violence and then he said there was violence on both sides and the media want nuts over that particular statement there's a lot more in the press conference that was bad but that was correct there was violence on both sides and Antipa was causing a lot of it where was Obama for a year anytime there was a violent incident Obama tended to downplay the violence and instead talk about the underlying root causes of the violence and he got away with it remember in April 2009 it's amazing the double standard that holds for the right and the left okay so there's this report that comes out from the FBI and DHS April 2016 talking about the violence of antiva flashback before that seven years okay it's now April 2009 shortly after Obama takes office and then Hartman of Homeland Security under the auspices of Janet Napolitano who's now in charge of the University of California system issued a report saying that white right-wing extremism was on the rise labeling anti-abortion anti immigration groups a suspect the report specifically called out the prospect of lone-wolf terrorism from those who agreed with quote-unquote right-wing viewpoints the report was really vague but the Obama administration stood by it so how about his apparently very specific report regarding an even from the year of the election not a word from the Obama administration we're only finding out about it a year and a half after it happened a year and a half and let's contrast the language of that 2009 memo with the language of the Obama administration regarding political violence the 2009 memo about right-wing violence it says quote debates over appropriate immigration levels and enforcement policy generally fall within the realm of protected political speech under the First Amendment but in some cases anti-immigration or strident Pro enforcement fervor has been directed against specific groups and has the potential to turn violent has the potential to turn violent what does that even mean has the potential to turn violent that's vague but the Obama administration stood by it but when left-wing rhetoric actually turned violent what did Obama do he said all the violence is bad but they do have some grievances don't they I'm speaking specifically about President Obama's speech in July 2016 after a black radical parroting black lives matter talking points went out and murdered five police officers and wounded seven others in Dallas the officers were protecting the black lives matter March at the time Obama actually spent an inordinate amount of time echoing BLM's message at their funeral service at their funeral service imagine if President Trump had actually gone out after Charlottesville and he had said and he sort of did do this to a certain extent the media went nuts you remember that he went out and he said listen this violence is terrible but Confederate statues right there's the legit arguments we had over a Confederate statue the media went completely nuts here's what Obama said at the funeral four people who were murdered by a black lives matter supporter a black radical who was echoing the talking points of black lives matter here's what he said quote we know the bias remains we know it whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or of Middle Eastern descent we've all seen this bigotry in our own lives at some point we've heard at it we've heard it at times in our homes if we're honest perhaps we've heard prejudice in our own heads and felt it in our own hearts and he talked about how the cops are a bunch of racists amazing the treatments okay but not one peep about empty thought not one peep about antiva I want to talk a little bit more about that and how the Democrats are really split now between their radicals and their moderates and their only hope left is getting President Trump and how they hope to do that but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at the u.s.

needs to be asked every Democrat needs to be asked about ends heat at this point they should have been asked about it a year ago they should have been grilled about it a year ago they should have been grilled about it after what happened in Sacramento but the media was too ensconced in its narrative of antifa as Normandy fighters to actually go out and fight violence that's despicable that's truly despicable and you can see the split that's happening now inside the Democratic Party between the so-called moderates and the radicals the radicals are still saying well let's see if it has a point they're not so bad and the moderates who are now being led by Nancy Pelosi of all people they're saying auntie was really bad if the Democrats don't come together around this I think it's indicative of a broader split inside the Democratic Party the far left of the Democratic Party is even further left in Bernie Sanders they're moving left at an increasingly rapid pace the Democratic Party has split and the old-school Hillary Clinton quote-unquote moderate Democratic Party which was never moderate they were being left in the wake even Bernie Sanders is now being seen increasingly as a guy who's not radical enough I've never seen a party move this far to one extreme this fast and you can see it happening in real time and Tifa is accelerating that Trump is certainly accelerating that the left's hatred for Trump is driving them off the rails every Democrat should now be asked will you denounce the antifa Louie's announced them I think marthy sin has a great piece of Washington Post and it's it is interesting it's fascinating how white supremacists who get violent white supremacist who get violent they are seen as the ultimate evil totally fair they are an ultimate evil left wing extremists who get violent you know I'm talking about Communists and anarchists they're seen as somehow superior to Nazis which is weird to me I mean the Communist more responsible for a couple hundred million deaths over the course of the last century they as Marc Thiessen said I'm not sure why it is that somebody who gets violence in American streets carrying the flag of Stalin is better than somebody that's violent in American streets carrying the flag of Hitler these both seem like terrible people and there is a moral equivalence there and I think that's right now communism is an ideology that is just as evil as Nazism in its own way it's not racist the way the Nazism was but it is certainly classist I mean these are people who suggested that people who are bushwa be murdered hey that you could separate people based on class it's funny how both of these groups seems to censor when it comes down to it they both come down on the same side when it comes to the Jewish Question neither of them really like the Jews very much Stalin wasn't really fond and neither was Hitler but it is amazing how we in the United States we've taken the sort of sanguine view of communism in a way that we never have with Nazism even though they were both at the time cheered by Democrats at the time the the Nazi movement was seen as sort of a proto fascist or fascist proto forerunner of a more sophisticated movement that eventually could be used for good by a lot of people including some mainstays of the democratic back in the day so again the only point to be made here is that we ought to be looking at the violence on both sides and condemning it and condemning the ideology that underlies it but instead what we're seeing is some people on the Left condemning the violence not all and very few people on the left condemning the ideology at all whereas everybody on the right who has any brain at all is condemning white supremacist in the all right okay so what does this mean Democrats have to know this stuff doesn't make them popular okay the Antipa stuff is not going to make them popular it's not gonna make them well-loved it makes them seem extreme and crazy because they're being extreme and crazy and so instead what they are focusing in on is their final hope the last hope right their very last hope of all is beyond from destroying himself is Robert Muller so Robert Muller is the special investigator and now there's some new developments in Robert Miller's case again they need to shut down these leaks these leaks are just ridiculous so here is here is the report from media I this is this is from yesterday from Joseph Wolfson the team of Special Counsel Robert Muller is reportedly collaborating with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in it's an ongoing investigation according to a new report from Politico Muller's team and Schneiderman's office have been in contact in recent weeks exchanging information and evidence on former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his financial transactions anonymous sources familiar with the collaboration have said they're potentially building a criminal case possibly for money laundering but no decision has been made whether or not charges will be filed nothing is imminent one source told Politico as political reports Schneiderman can potentially provide Muller additional leverage to get Man afford to cooperate with his investigation noting that President Trump does not have pardoning power over state crime so here is the difficulty here so everybody has been talking about Trump can always just pardon anybody who is convicted or anybody who's indicted not true state crimes if you are condemned of murder in a state court you cannot be pardoned by the president you can only be pardoned by the governor so what does that mean what it looks like he looks like Robert Muller is coordinating with Eric Schneiderman the very political very left Attorney General of the state of New York to go after Paul Manafort who as I've said before is pretty corrupt and then use those state charges as a way to get Manafort to flip on Trump that could be what's happening here right you have Sneiderman charged man affordance Court and then say we'll drop those charges if you testify against Trump and Trump can't pardon Manta fort and just get out of that conundrum that'd be very clever by Muller if that's what he intends on doing but it's very dangerous for President Trump obviously because sitting around waiting to be to be to have your former campaign chair indicted at the state level and then see where that ends up is very dangerous game a lot of people are suggesting that based on this Trump should fire Muller that would be the biggest disaster of all right now there's a game of chicken going on Muller is going as far as you can almost hearing Trump to fire him if Trump's fires him all hell will break loose it's gonna be very difficult for Republicans to stand up in the face of President Trump firing the special investigator who's looking into election corruption that's not the only story involving Muller today according Betsy Woodruff from The Daily Beast special counsel Bob Muller has teamed up with the IRS according to sources familiar with his investigation into alleged Russian election interference his probe has enlisted the help of agents from the IRS is Criminal Investigations unit this unit known as CI is one of the federal government's most tight-knit specialized secretive investigative entities it has 2,500 agents focusing exclusively on financial crime including tax evasion and money laundering the IRS does have access to Trump's tax returns potential financial crimes are a central part of Muller's probes that is part of the thing Trump has said in the past that that would be the red line for him as if Muller started looking into financial dealings of his family and Muller said screw that I'm looking wherever I please and there's a problem too which is that Trump has not actually staffed up the IRS right Trump has not actually staffed up the IRS this is according to Daily Beast the team up between the IRS and Muller probe could come with political complications Muller has already taken some criticism for the number of Democratic donors on his team those critiques intensified yesterday after the announcement about Schneiderman also it is pretty clear that Trump has not filled out a lot of the senior positions at these particular at these particular agencies where Trump has not yet named his pick to run the tax division which is a post that require Senate confirmation and also a post which could help out Muller in his investigation so right now and Obama appointee is filling the slot that can work with Muller to give him the information so Muller can get all the dirt that he wants right now Trump has put himself in the situation because remember it was Trump's activity regarding James Comey it was his dragging in of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that led to the appointment of the special counsel in the first place now if he fires the special counsel it'll look like a cover-up so it's a full-scale problem for President Trump at this point a lot of people saying well I should just fire people and get it over with and that way they can't have grounds to impeach him again impeachment is a political grounds I think his best move here is to wait it out and I honestly think that that he's actually innocent of the Russia collusion I don't think that Trump himself was colluding with Russia I think that there is a possibility that manna fort was working with the Russians because Nana forts always work with the Russians I think there is the possibility that Flynn was doing so but the idea that Trump knew about it is a whole different thing so you could easily see a scenario where Trump's underlings go down and it looks more like iran-contra that it looks like Watergate it looks a lot more like somebody underneath Trump goes down then like the President himself goes down and that's why I'm saying that I don't think Trump should fire Muller but what Mulder's doing is obviously provocative but Muller is doing is obviously aggressive and so he must think that he's got something the Democrats obviously are just ecstatic about this MSNBC's Mark Halperin he says Muller is a ruthless opponent and is not afraid of President Trump Muller is a cyborg with a head of heart and a brain I mean this is this is it this is an opponent unlike he's a cyborg who has a head of heart and a brain okay he's a relentless opponent and one of the underappreciated aspects of how he's building this operation I think is his ability because of his vast experience to coordinate he's in sync with the congressional investigations whose investigators and members are not issuing you know immunity the people are bringing up witnesses who will interfere with the case he's coordinating within the Justice Department the FBI you don't hear any unhappiness coming from there and now he's coordinating with another guy with subpoena power another guy who is fearless and not afraid of Donald Trump and a guy who can bring charges that the president can't pardon for none of this is that accident we're seeing through a glass darkly what does Muller operations like we see only a tiny bit of it but it's clear from everything we see that there is a strategy here there's a there's a fearlessness and there's a core level of coordination that makes anyone trying to help the President on this be put in a very defensive position okay so you can see the excitement from the media and all this and we'll talk a little bit more about the excitement from some fake news people like actual fig news people in just a second but first I want to say thank you to the sponsors over at tides of history this is a brand new podcast it is just fantastic Google tides of history for more

developments in Malloy they're placing all their hope in Muller I don't think my waters gonna give them what they want I don't think this is gonna come down to some major indictments of President Trump or even anyone who is super close to him but you can see the excitement on the left they're so excited they think that finally there will be a magic bullet okay when you are relegating to hoping that a magic bullet is gonna take out the president I mean literally when you're relegated to hope it I shouldn't take me out you pull in association with presidents because that's actually a thing with JFK but when you're relegated to hoping that something bad is going to take the president out let just some random event is gonna take the president out some random story then you're in serious trouble I know this because there are a lot of people on the right who are attempting to push the birther story back in 2012 hoping that suddenly there would be evidence that that Obama was not actually eligible for office and then you'd have to leave office and I know a lot of good-hearted people got taken in by this because Obama wouldn't release his birth certificate I always thought it was stupid I always thought it was unsubstantiated I always thought there was no evidence of it but there are a lot of people who bought into it or at least left their mind open to it because there's a hopeful thing that oh maybe there'll be a maybe there will be a deus ex machina that some something will come from the sky and knock Obama out you can see the Democrats doing the same thing with the Muller investigation right now dan Rather who is the very definition of fake news he came out yesterday and he spoke about hurricane Vladimir right under the Putin the Putin story is gonna take out Trump and what you seeing behind after time is a president who is within himself seized with fear and that's gonna be you know a political hurricane is out there at sea for him we'll call it hurricane Vladimir if you will the whole Russian thing it's still pretty far out at sea but each each day and tonight we saw it again with the two things you reported the Russian reporting from Politico and the Financial Times this hurricane this political hurricane it's still far out at sea is building an intensity because say well it was category largest category one's going to get it over to its approaching category for don't stretch hasn't met a metaphor too far but that's nothing says classy quite like in the middle of a category four hurricane hitting the main United States likening a political scandal to a hurricane that's going to take out the President of the United States just very classy stuff from a guy who lost his job in 2004 for legitimately making up a document or pushing a forged document about President Bush he thought this is the irony he thought in 2004 that that was going to be the magic the magic bullet that ended up destroying the Bush presidency that he was going to release this letter about Bush going AWOL it turned out that was fake virtually any time somebody says I have the magic tape I have the magic thing that's gonna take out the president only once only once in American history really has there been some sort of magic document magic tapes that ended up taking down a president was Nixon and so everybody wants to go back to that model that was that was something that was was unique in American history I don't think you're gonna see something like that again in the near future but you can see that the hopes of the Democrats are riding on this thing Keith Olbermann is saying the same thing he says everyone in the cabinets gonna be a peach not only is Trump gonna be impeached everyone's gonna be a peach here's Keith Olbermann broadcasting from his mother's basement Republican senators and congressmen finally speaking out against Trump on Charlottesville on our pay Oh on the response to hurricane Harvey on the Secretary of the Treasury watching the Eclipse while standing next to 200 billion dollars in gold on the military transgender ban the daughter of the Secretary of the Interior herself a veteran calling for his impeachment over that a website run by a Republican research firm noting with Sporn that in one month Trump had attacked nearly one out of every seven Republican senators the little tendrils are popping up through the soil so well fertilized by seven months of this administration and the president of both Roger stones insurrection may in fact be coming to pass except it will be nonviolent and when it is over it will not be good news for stone or his fellow travelers oh and it ends there will not be Trump see this is a great hope there will not be Trump I say it very seriously just like I used to say and vlag Oh back on SportsCenter back in the day this is the great hope okay again if you're banking on this hope and you're on the left let me recommend that you get a better program stop associating with antia and start providing some solutions to the American people it turns out that Republicans their jobs the only consolation is the Democrats are even worse at theirs they're even worse at theirs Democrats are now that CNN is now so desperate about Trump that they're legitimately attempting to push their own presidential candidates it's an amazing thing I was watching yesterday at the gym CNN was on the TV and again I was not I was in the middle of working out so I couldn't go up and just throw things at the TV but they decided to have on John Kasich and and I think it's John Hickenlooper I can never remember Hickenlooper his first name he's the governor of Colorado and they presented yes John Hickenlooper and they were both on with Brianna Keilar from CNN and Keeler actually presented to them they they were presenting their joint health care plan that's going nowhere cuz no one cares what these guys have to say because John Kasich is a wadded up piece of paper you stuck in your pocket and it went through the wash and John Hickenlooper is is like a light ly weirder version of Gary Johnson and so they're both sitting there and CNN actually proposes to them on the air that they should run a joint candidacy for president a bipartisan candidacy for president god no we whipped up a little something just a lot for why you know not dog powder okay we're running for well you know the big the big white house so we whipped up a little something it's just a just a little poster just to give you a taste of what it would look like so I don't know isn't that a little enticing Governor Kasich and then Kasich went on to avoid the question I said oh no no you know that I'd have to talk to my wife about that I'm the only reason they're even proposing these stupid health care plans is because they want to run together or they want like would anyone take John Hickenlooper seriously as a human running for president and look at the guy you really think that's gonna be a thing the loop loop de loop 2020 like that's gonna be a thing kasich tried to run last time and stayed in long enough to get Donald Trump nominated and everyone dislikes him because he's jerk I mean I've been told I've been informed on very good information that his father is a mailman but that's about all that I know to recommend him yeah but this is how desperate the media are now they're trying to push Kasich Hickenlooper as an alternative to the awful crappy 2020 Trump Kamala Harris race that is sure to come yeah okay so with all that happening Trump this morning tweets out that he's basically been targeted by forces beyond his control the truth is that there is some of that happening okay there's there's now a story out that transcripts were viewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee revealed that FBI director James Comey had decided months before the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton concluded that he would not recommend criminal prosecution GOP chairman Grassley Senator Lindsey Graham they all requested all the records related to companies firing in the transcript the FBI's principal deputy general counsel of national security and cyber law Tricia Anderson told the Office of Special Counsel that Comey had drafted a statement in early May that he would later give in July 2016 that legally exonerated Hillary Clinton so he already decided he was going to exonerate Hillary Clinton long before FBI agents finished their work okay that'd be good enough reason to fire him right there Comey was always a bad FBI director and that is just more evidence of it so when Trump says that he's been victimized by a system that's in place clearly that's the case and that by the way will be his defense to anything that Muller comes up with which is why I say it's not necessary to fire Muller because I don't think that they're gonna be enough Republicans who even jump on board as long as it seems that his investigation has been compromised in any way I don't think Trump has tons to fear from it I actually really don't I think there'll be a lot of bad headlines but I don't think that he gets peached over anything the Muller has to bring unless it clearly implicates the president directly okay time for some things I like things I hate and then we'll do some mailbag so things I like we've been doing philosophy all week so this is one of my favorite philosophical books as you probably could have guessed Machiavelli's at the prints so this is a book that has gotten a very bad rap it's it's short it's very readable it's fascinating written by and niccolo machiavelli from back in during the Renaissance in Italy and he was trying to advise trying to get a job basically I believe was the Borges and he was he was trying to make it clear to them how he thought they should govern he was trying to give his his own book of little political advice people identify Machiavelli as like this evil sinister guy who's trying to manipulate circumstances he was actually proponent of what he called ver - ver - as it's like virtue but it doesn't mean like Saints who sacrifice themselves necessarily virtue according to Machiavelli means a certain quality of manliness that allows you to uphold the principles for what you stand so virtue isn't just the values that you hold it's how you about defending those values and sometimes that requires certain degree of ruthlessness this is the handbook obviously on political ruthlessness every political science major has read it as every political science major should it is very readable it's very readable so I tried to recommend philosophy that's readable which is what I'm not recommending Hegel or Kant but Machiavelli is very readable the prince it's a it's a terrific book and it's a very short read it's again it's like 120 pages very short okay time for some things that I hate so things that I hate today I'm gonna show you two police videos that I hate both of these police videos but I want to explain why I think the media jumps on one a lot more than they jump on the other so there's one police video that comes courtesy of this department I believe this is in Georgia there's a police officer and he pulls over a woman and she won't get out of her cars in Cobb County Georgia she won't get out of this back in July 2016 just broke I think yesterday and she won't get out of her car and she says and he says why don't you take your phone I'm arresting you why don't you take your phone and call up your and and I want you to call up your boyfriend or something to let them know that you need to be bailed out and she says I don't want to take my hands off the steering wheel because I've seen all the videos cuz I've seen all the videos and apparently she's a drunk driver and she was drunk and kind of belligerent and wouldn't get out of her car anything and so the cop jokingly says well you got nothing to worry about because we only shoot black people right okay so idiot idiot idiot terrible thing to say obviously but does he mean that literally I mean I'll let you watch the tape it doesn't seem to me that he means yes we literally go around every day shooting black people it sounds to me like he's got a drunk woman in the car who's being an idiot and he thinks he's joking with her to try and get her off her guard and so he says the stupid thing sarcastically like you got nothing to worry about we shoot black people hahahahaha right the same way that steven crowder and I make Jewish jokes right he's making a joke about how cops are racist that seems to me what this actually is he got fired over it here's the here's the actual tape yeah we go black people right okay the right at the end is the dead giveaway that he's being sarcastic but it doesn't matter obviously you can't save this sort of thing because that's asinine but he ends up being fired and this is supposed to be some sort of indication that the police know they're there institutionally racist if I guess you can read it that way that's not how I read it I mean it seems to be pretty obvious from the tape that what the guy is doing is the lady says I'm looked at all these videos and he's saying yeah you've looked at the videos I know we're all terrible but we only kill black people even according to the videos so you know get out of the car write this or use the phone so he ends up being fired for this this is a national story okay this led NBC News today this led NBC News here is a story about cop malfeasance that to me is significantly worse because this woman was a criminal and she end up going to jail this particular case comes out of I believe Texas oh no I'm sorry Salt Lake City and this is a video of a woman named Alex wobbles she is a nurse and there was a I see of the backstory there was a driver who's trying get away from the cops he was speeding in his truck trying get away from the cops he crossed over the median line and he went he plowed headlong into a Mack truck he was badly burned he was in a coma basically and the cops come in they're trying to absolve the other driver in the crash they come into the hospital and they say we want to take his blood okay it is illegal under Supreme Court precedent from 2016 to take somebody's blood without any sort of probable cause without a search warrant or without the permission of the person persons unconscious and there's no search warrant so the nurse says listen you know I may like you but I can't let you take the guy's blood because that's illegal okay they arrest her and they brutalize her in the process here's the actual tape okay no we're done we're done you're under arrest as always we're done so they arrest her over nothing she was never charged with the crime they handcuffed her they dragged her out physically okay she was the one who is obeying Allah the cop wasn't and here's the point of why I'm pointing and comparing these videos most cop bad action has little it has little or nothing to do with racism it has to do with cops just being crappy at their jobs just like most of the things you do in your daily job have nothing to do with racism if you do it wrong it has to do with you being bad at your job and if it happens there's a black person in front of you and you're bad at your job you might be accused of racism the same thing happens with cops okay Adam Carolla makes this point all the time and I think that he's exactly right if you're a black person getting pulled over by a cop and the cop was a jerk he might immediately assume that it was because he was black but being a white person who's pulled over by a cop he knows that it's just because some cops are jerks right that I think it's a perfectly understandable perspective and when you're a member of minority group that is the tendency you know my father my grandfather I remember growing up there'd be times where somebody would be a jerk and my dad say the guy's probably an anti-semite and I'd say dad it probably isn't cause he's an anti-semite he's probably just cuz he's an a-hole right you know they're like dad that happens like people are jerks I think that you're a jerk is a better explainer 95% of the time than you're a racist and so even the guy in the first tape it seems to me he's acting out of ignorance stupidity incompetence he had 28 by the way the evidence for that is the dead 28 years on the police force before he was fired not a single instance in which he was accused of racism so you know that seems to me better evidence than that tape of sarcasm but the point here is that bad police action we would be better off talking about when police exceed their mandate when police are brutal when police are again out over what they are supposed to be doing when police exceed the use of force and when they do all those things that seems to me a better explanation of police behavior than just blaming endemic institutional racism I mean now it's levels is white they didn't stop the Salt Lake City cop from dragging her out for no reason and if she'd been black what would the headline have been all right I found some levels him in a black the headline would've been completely different right it would white officer drags black woman out of the ER black lives matters would've been marching we would have been told that this was just unacceptable racism from the Salt Lake City Police Department and we hear the same thing whenever there's a whenever there's a death I remember out here in in Los Angeles in Orange County there was a homeless white guy named Kelly Thomas and who's beaten to death he was diagnosed with schizophrenia was beaten to death on the streets of Fulton in California by a bunch of cops he was white if he'd been black that would been a national story it was like Rodney King level I mean it was worse than Rodney King as he actually died Kelly Thomas and he actually didn't do not as much wrong as Rodney King and it wasn't a national headline in the same way because he was white again I think the same cops would be Rodney King beat Kelly Thomas and I think they're both wrong but that's a different kind of wrong than racism necessarily okay time to do a little bit of mail bag so rouxelle or rochelle adler she says who do you want to see sit on the Iron Throne at the end of Game of Thrones so I mean my personal preference would be to - so Rob's head back onto his neck and make him King I was a big Robb fan and it was very sad to me when they knocked him off I do like the theory it's not right but I like the theory that Ned Stark is still alive I think that's hilarious and then he switched places with Jake and Hagar in the in the in the jail at the end at the end of season one but yeah of the players who are left on the board and in the Iron Throne as I've said before my heart says I would love to see tormund and Brienne with their giant children but striding the world I think torment would be a good King because he's not interested in ruling anybody else I think you but I think that in all likelihood will end up being a Council of advisers in a democracy okay Janet says hello Ben how do you think we can encourage young Millennials to marry and understand the importance of the nuclear family what steps would you insist on taking when you have the culture especially how I would in the media teaching us that a marriage and family are unnecessary well I think that the first step that we can take is when kids are young model great marriages for them model great marriages for them TV is modeling why it's great to be single and it's all a lie okay how many single people do you know who are really happy about being single like ecstatic about being single not that they're happy they can be happy but I mean just like about that aspect of their life they're like yeah you know what I love being single okay other than a few guys who like to cat around they're not very many people in the United States who are like yeah I love being single a lot of people living together a lot of people have girlfriends but they don't get married because pop culture has told them that marriage is a patriarchal institution in which people are miserable and they fall out of love with each other and bla bla bla bla the best thing you can do for your kids is model a good marriage and everybody who's married should model good marriages for the rest of the world that's the single best way to draw people toward marriage marriage is an institution that does make people happier by every pool available both men and women are happier married than they are unmarried you know kids make you unhappy or in some ways but a lot happier in other ways that's a different question though kids it's really fascinating how Western civilization has made kids into dogs and dogs into kids but that's that's a different question than marriage itself marriage itself is still an amazing institution and it is a lifelong commitment of somebody to you and knowing that you're going to be able to grow with that person the rest of your life is a very different thing than the idea that you have sex with random partners so you get together with and Bob you know I think that's garbage and Nathan says do you tithe so Nathan I don't I should yeah there's one area where I come up short my own religious observance and I'm moving toward it I met with my financial planner the other day and we were going to start laying out some money toward that goal josh has been and what is your position on right-to-work laws and what is your prediction for the right of the future right-to-work laws in America so right-to-work laws are great right-to-work laws basically state for those who don't know that there are a lot of laws on the books in places like California there was in Wisconsin there is in Ohio that if you want to work for the police department or the fire department or the teachers you you have to be unionized you have to work for the teachers union so you can't actually be employed by the state of California as a full-time teacher without being a member of the teachers union that's nonsense it's garbage it's collusion it should be illegal right-to-work laws basically say that you do not have to be a member of any Union in order for you to work and also that they can't confiscate your wages I mean the unions have the government so sewn up there's a great book called shadow bosses by a friend of mine named Mallory factor and his wife Elizabeth about this they're a bunch of states that actually remove the state will do this when they pay a paycheck to a teacher in California they actively remove your Union fee out of your paycheck and give it to the Union okay the Union is a private organization that's insane that's like if I went to all of my employees and I said listen we have a charity fund over here and we're gonna use that charity fund for a bunch of nice things and you have to give to the charity fund and then the state says okay well when we collect your taxes we're gonna take out a little extra and give it to your employer okay this is it's totally nuts that this is how it works right to work laws are a good thing and not to be pushed Alexander says do your kids believe in the Tooth Fairy well they haven't lost any teeth yet so I haven't actually had to have that conversation I see nothing wrong with kids believing in the Tooth Fairy or the Easter Bunny or Santa Claus believing life will disabuse you of all sorts of notions later but I think it's kind of charming I think it's kind of charming and kids figure it out pretty fast I mean the fact is the kids know that it's really mommy and daddy but they but they like them the mythology of it is fun Taylor says hey Ben what are your thoughts on red light traffic cameras thanks Taylor so I'm of divided mine on red light traffic cameras the part of me that is annoyed with getting tickets hates them the part of me that says that the law should be equally applied likes them so the the question is whether red light traffic cameras actually capture dangerous activity or whether they're just prophylactic rules that they are enforcing you know like there are times when somebody is going through the intersection and it's the very last second and you're going through a red light and there's no one there is that somebody who deserves a 200 dollar ticket the same way that somebody who runs a red light in the middle of somebody else's green light deserves a ticket I'm not sure I'm not sure like there's some judgment calls to this but if you want an equally enforce traffic law I think that it makes sense if you want to safer if you presumably if you want to safer you know traffic regime then you would have equal application of laws and having cops sit around it's even Strout let's put this way red light traffic cameras are a much better idea than hiring cops to sit around your intersections instead of policing actual crime this has been a pet peeve of mine with the police for years that has nothing to do the officers I mean the other day I was pulled over right near the offices a couple months ago I was pulled over near the office and I said to the police officer thanks for everything else you do and he kind of smiled and nodded at me he said yeah this is this is ridiculous because they'd set up a one of these speed traps and they had I think four motorcycle cops and three squad cars just on the side street over here to catch people who are making illegal rights and it's like okay we got crime in the city like real crime in the city even the cops don't want to be doing that dantana says hey Ben what's the best way to get over a heartbreak the best way to get over our heartbreak is to get back out there not to sit around moping about it if you sit around moping about it then all you're doing is you are is you are engaging in in giving your the the control of your feelings over to somebody else that's always a mistake okay you are in control of your own feelings you're a rational human being do not give control of your feelings over to someone else that empowers them it does not empower you and not to get all Marcus Aurelius stoic on you but the fact is that it is up to you how you decide to treat the circumstances that surround you if you get dumped if you have a heartbreak then I would suggest that you you move on as fast as fast as best you can in as quick a manner as you can don't do this routine where it's like well if I just sit around everything will eventually sort itself out it won't Emanuel says assuming the worst situation and that the investigation drags down Trump what do you believe what happened to the Republican Party well Emanuel it sort of depends on whether the Republican Party goes along with everything Trump is willing to do so let's say worst-case scenario worst-case scenario is that there's a direct letter from Donald Trump with Vladimir Putin saying Vlad I need some help you got any information on Hillary Clinton and Vlad writing back saying yes blue mold we have some information on Hillary Clinton kill Matias enjoy we would like to see you elected and Trump race back saying thanks love it oh so you can have Crimea right if Dad let's say that's that's worst-case scenario okay so if that happens and the Republicans sit around and don't impeach him then they end up going down with him if they separate off from him they don't as much remember a lot of Republicans were getting ready to vote for impeachment for Richard Nixon when he resigned it seemed like a disaster for the Republican Party and Nixon resigns in what 75 I think and and by the time it's over like six years later is Ronald Reagan so the idea that it was the idea that it was the end of the world when that happened it was sorry it was it was 74 when Nixon resigned August 74 Nixon resigned Gerald Ford fills out his term there's one term of Democrats and then go right back to Marit Ronald Reagan so it doesn't kill the party to have a president who's a failure it does kill the party to have a party that endorses the failure Megan says what's your number one tip for conservatives in college number one tip for conservatives in college is keep your head down and be be specific about the points that you choose to make don't always go into every argument guns a-blazing understand what the purpose of the argument is Brendon says I want to know what your stance on cussing is I know another podcast you have a much more colorful language than on your show but I'd like to know you feel about cussing in regular life thanks Brendon well I think you shouldn't do it in front of kids I think it's impolite I don't think that it is a moral failing in any serious way this is where I differ from a lot of other religious people I may be wrong I'm fully willing to to listen to that I think that there are times when the use of particular language is necessary and appropriate I think everybody does over curse but I don't think that it's a deep abiding problem in society that Alya let's put this way I think that the the overuse of the f-word by everyone now like when I was growing up no one used the f-word ever it was just a thing you didn't use the f-word now everyone uses the f-word I think it is a laxity in moral standards that has led to the laxity and language but I think that if you're a person who drops the occasional f-bomb when you're frustrated you're in the car alone so I think that this is makes you a lesser human being now I don't I think that that's psychological studies have actually shown that when you drop an f-bomb it actually helps alleviate pain and anger when you're in the car alone by yourself like if you stub your tone you all the f-word don't do in front of kids don't do in front of other people but if you do it'll probably make you feel better than if you just didn't Daniel says do you have any sort of special show plan for when you surpass Oprah and the iTunes ratings I don't have any special show plan you'll get a normal show you will knock out a car and you will not get a car and you will not get a car and none of you will get a car go get your own damn car get a job Fox a million sandwich rights is serial a soup no cereal is not a soup I have two things pursue but they're a bunch of things that people think our soup that I think are not soup okay so number one soup has to be hot I know this is controversial I know a lot of people think you can have cold soup nonsense there's no such thing as cold soup that's called garbage okay no one should be eating cold soup second soup has to be cooked okay when you make of when you make a vegetable puree and it hasn't been cooked or you make a fruit puree that's called a smoothie okay a fruit smoothie is a puree when you give me a bowl and it's just chopped up fruit can they say oh it's a soup no it's not a soup you're stupid okay Noah says Ben I was wondering if you want any guns I know how scoop scrupulous California is and if you do what make and model I do own a handgun I own a shotgun it's a Mossberg 500 the shotgun and Smith & Wesson 9-millimeter is my is my handgun my Andrew says hi been during the show we only ever see you sitting behind a desk I must know have you ever done an episode without wearing pants would you ever consider it we wouldn't be able to see anyway well first of all Andrew you might be lying you might be able to see me I just don't know and that would be really sick and perverse of you to get me to take my pants off just for that purpose how dare you second of all that I was implored to wear shorts the other day because it was 101 that it was like a hundred and ninety-seven degrees in the studio is really hot two days ago I came in in pants anyway this is the difference between me and Michael moles and Andrew Clavin I came in in pants Andrew Clavin came in pants Michael Mills came in naked and then stripped off a layer of skin so he could be more naked that's just - Michael moles is John final question he says hi been my fourth grader was reading a book written for a second to third graders by an author she likes only to discover the central theme of the book was the main character dealing with her two best friends coming out as gay and her love interest we hadn't decided whether who's bi or not sounds like a delightful book this brings me to my question when do you think is the optimal time to broach the birds and bees conversation with kids do you think this is all the time also the time to bring up LGBT issues or is that a separate discussion it is a separate discussion ok the birds-and-the-bees is about human reproduction it's not about sexual pleasure the birds and the bees is about what you do to make babies ok because that is how the universe continues to operate that's how the world continues to function if that doesn't happen to humanity ends what you do to make yourself feel good on your genitals is a different discussion then what is the purpose of marriage and procreation it is it's a different thing I gotta remember when my dad gave me the birds and the bees talk he literally sat down with an anatomy book and he said here's how everything works and if you have any questions come to me and I'm happy to explain it to you and that worked out great I asked my dad any questions that I had any we were never shy in our house about talking about the the way that sex works and so you know I think that being open with your child about how things work is the best these issues will make themself a parent that anyway I don't think it's like you have to sit around and wonder when do I tell my kid that your kid will come to you with questions if you're open about these issues your kid will come to you with questions and ask the questions and you'll be given the opportunity to talk about them but you should think in advance about how you want to talk about these issues because there are moral issues embedded in the sexual pleasure question that are not embedded in how sexual reproduction work questions and that's a separate conversation for my money I don't think that are the same thing at all and I think conflating the two is one of the things has done that's actually quite awful his conflating the value of sex with the value of physical pleasure I don't think that that is the entire thing and I think making the two identical has been a real disservice to children throughout the country okay so we'll be back here next week we don't have a show on Monday I believe because it's Labor Day so thanks commies appreciate it we will be back on Tuesday and we will have all of the news for you then I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
