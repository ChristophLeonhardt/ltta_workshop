Donald Trump's own criminal defense lawyer personally warned the embattled president that he could wind up in prison wearing an orange jumpsuit this is not normal this is a first so let me repeat the news that is actually rocking Washington right now even amidst a lot of other news regarding of course the Supreme Court confirmation hearings and a new senator named a replace John McCain but the big news here is Donald Trump's former criminal lawyer John Dowd who publicly split with the president over their strategy warning donald trump that he could end up in prison in concluding that trump was lying in their own preparations for potential Moeller interview this obviously raises a ton of questions right now like why lie to your own lawyer and secret prep sessions about russia and obstruction and what else did donald trump's lawyer see that brought him to such a stark and disturbing conclusion and what on earth to mr. Dowd and the White House have to say about all of this right now this evening well we have some of the answers for you now this report is not from a single article or a few blind quotes it is a big deal precisely because it's from the Washington Post journalist known for helping bring down another president Bob Woodward who famously reported Watergate and says for this book he conducted hundreds of interviews today he even released separately audio of his own personal phone call with Trump now the book features Trump's aides hiding papers from the president insulting his intelligence and Donald Trump's stewing over the Russia probe all of this detailed piecemeal in a release through a Washington Post article and it reports for the very first time the Donald Trump's criminal defense team tried to prep him for a potential Moeller interview and they were holding these prep sessions through a practice interview is sort of a draft Muller interview back in January and that's where Trump lawyer John Dowd quote peppered Trump with questions provoking stumbles contradictions and lies until the president eventually lost his cool which led to an estimated 30 minute rant by Trump ending with this important admission Trump basically secretly telling his own lawyers quote I don't really want to testify before Muller that of course contradicts Donald Trump's public claims that he does want to testify and then there's this wouldwould reporting that Dow then would Moeller about that very practice session even reenacting part of it in a kind of an effort to show on their part the Trump was somehow his own worst enemy and it didn't make sense for Dow to let the president talk to Miller here's that passage quote I'm not gonna sit there and let him look like an idiot Dowd reportedly told Miller and you published that transcript because everything leaks in Washington and the guys overseas are gonna say I told you he was an idiot I told you he was a dumbbell what are we dealing with this idiot for Millar reportedly replying I understand now that is a rare peek inside the highest levels of negotiations in the Muller probe the meetings that Bob Miller attends personally in Bob Woodward let's be clear tonight he is staking his reputation on getting these reported details right now doubt and the White House are strongly denying these reports and we'll get into that let's get into the prison warning no because Woodward reports that by March Dowd was trying to find any way to get through to Donald Trump about what he saw through his legal judgment as very real risks of criminal exposure and yes even a president can face legal risk so he reportedly urged Trump quote don't testify it's either that or an orange jumpsuit Trump reportedly responding I'll be a real good witness and doubt respond to that quote you're not a good witness mr. president I'm afraid I just can't help you now Dowd may deny the words in this account but it's an undisputed fact that he then left the White House the next day now Trump's aides say this entire book consists of quote fabricated stories but let's be clear as we get into the ramifications of this very very big report the fake news card is not going to cut a lot of ice against Bob Woodward who's reported on presidents from both parties his whole career in fact today journalists and politico's in both parties have been marveling at Woodward's reporting and backing up his factual reputation former bush spokesman Ari Fleischer who's tangled with Woodward said today Woodward is quote straight and never makes up quotes Fox News's Brit Hume treating the book as true and noting it depicts a quote chaos and dysfunctional White House now Woodward is already releasing his own receipts showing his high-level contact with bades in his effort to interview the president which Donald Trump declined though they did have a long phone call about that afterward where Woodward reiterated his reporting is from firsthand sources and I think there's nothing in this book that doesn't come from a first-hand source is that correct I believe are you naming names or do you just say sources yeah well it names real incidents so no but you do name sources I mean are you naming the people to just say you know people have said I'd say it to a on this day the following happened and everyone who's there including yourself it is quoted and I'm sorry I didn't get to ask you about these now finally perhaps no insider e Trump account would be complete without some baby talk the president is notoriously prickly about being called or considered a baby but he does project that insecurity by using the attack on others and according to a copy of this book reviewed by CNN Trump called Rudy Giuliani a baby during the 2016 campaign this was around the time Giuliani was trying to defend Trump in the access hollywood tape fiasco here's the quote Rudy you're a baby I've never seen a worse defense of me in my life they took your diaper off right there you're like a little baby that needed to be changed when the president asks Rudy Giuliani are you going to be a man I am joined for our special Washington edition by George will a conservative columnist for The Washington Post and tatra Bertrand who's covered this presidency and the Russia case for the Atlantic and former federal prosecutor John Flannery all at the table John I begin with you before we get to what George and I call the baby talk let's begin with the prosecutor talk what do you see as legally significant in this account well there are a couple of things that seemed to me significant the the failure of the defense attorneys of the president going to Muller and saying our client is a liar and we can't have him testify and he can't take the fifth the flip side of that meeting that's impressive to me is the statement by Muller saying I want to know his intent on the firing of Komi mm-hmm and that fits into everything we've heard from the beginning until now about the corrupt conduct of mr. Trump trying to obstruct the investigation in the hydra headed ways that he has also go to the rare peek of how Muller operates that if Bob Muller was convinced baseball on facts that this was a normal firing with normal legitimate intent then he would be okay with it I think that Muller is the kind of man I knew him from on the hill not in a criminal matter but a matter out in California when he was the US Attorney there and he's a by-the-book guy by the facts and I don't think you could find a bias in the man except to get to the truth and I think that's how he operates but I do think he's had a lot of things that have disturbed him and he wouldn't tell a defense attorney I'm concerned about the intent of the president when he fired Comey and and I think that that is pivotal and it drives them toward everything else because if the president is firing Comey to kill the investigation then it's consciousness of guilt he has to be doing it for a reason and that is that there was a conspiracy not a collusion there was a conspiracy in the campaign to use material that he knew was stolen that was itself a violation of the criminal law and explained in exchange for what to help a foreign nation with sanctions that were rightly justified and to remove them as part of his deal and whoever whatever else there is and and this is the you know only what we've seen publicly we've seen from the first two indictments that talked about how they set up the Russian involvement the the all the publicity that would help Trump and the third indictment if it comes and anytime soon I think it'll be the conspiracy the underlying conspiracy but this is a very disturbing statement that we have a president that can't tell the truth and his lawyer tells him he can't tell the truth and he's caught in this impossible Shakespearean dilemma of how do I preserve self as a president who has to speak without compromising my ability to avoid this investigation and he's answered it he's going to destroy the investigation he's not going to do it in the midterms he's going to do it when the midterms are over there are not many people who sit at these tables or go down to the building behind me and have the experience of Bob Woodward I think it's fair to say George will you do having covered and written about so many presidents and thought through what it means when a White House is if one believes Bob wood was reporting leaking like this and almost a cry for help give us the context as you see these new these new reports well Bob's challenged and I think he's probably met it as just tell us something we didn't already know because mr. Trump is himself an open book has been reading himself to the country for 30-some years now what I think is most interesting is that mr. Trump said were there names associated with these quotes you don't have to be a real veteran Washington to read between the lines for example when Lindsey Graham tells Bob Woodward about a quote of Obama or Trump insulting Obama we can pretty much assume he got it from Lindsey Graham so another friendship out it's not to me what what mr. Trump's employees say about him we know they've insulted him repeatedly it's what he says about his employees when he says to Ross Secretary of Commerce who's in charge of all these trade negotiations you're awful you're past your prime and when he says those sessions that he's retarded in a dumb southerner I'm married to a southerner they take that stuff seriously and that's his base down there right and you're using that language you're quoting the president's language correct so it seems to me that when you have a White House that is so full of Hobbs state of nature life is solitary poor nasty brutish and short when no one trusts anyone there's no loyalty beyond loyally there's no affection and to have a white house full of these people who are walking on eggshells tiptoeing through a minefield pick your metaphor it's it's a place where no one can fall back on anything no one can relax and to imagine what it's like in that atmosphere well it's hard to imagine and that comes with the test of this investigation but not a true foreign policy crisis not a real decision point where you say how does that environment this president deal with something where there could be massive repercussions on the line that's why the presidency is different than just about every other job in this town I count Shakespeare and Hobbes I'm very interested to see what literary reference you have Natasha but let me play for you while you gather your thoughts John doubt someone you've reported on and spoken with a lot his gloss and all this this is of course the clip from before these bombshell reports came out take a look do you believe the president will eventually sit down with Bob Muller based on your experience with him wanting to engage with counsel there's no bet there's no reason for the president to answer questions from Mulla Mulla has all the answers we gave him all the answers Muller has all the answers from the myriad of witnesses that he's been interviewing around the president I mean just look at the list it's George papadopolis Michael Flynn Don McGann Paul Manafort Rick gates I mean I think that this is really the root of the fear that they haven't allowing the President to sit down with Muller it's not just because he has a loose relationship with the truth to put it generously but it's also just because there are so many there are so many things that he's probably going to contradict about other people's testimonies that they've already told on the special counsel but I think that one of the most telling things about this book is the fact that Trump was not only he was lying to his lawyers I mean why would you lie to your own lawyers if you really feel like you don't have anything to hide and part of Trump's MO for the last couple decades of being in the real estate business is he's always thought that he's been able to talk his way out of anything that he can just get into a room he can negotiate with someone he can convince them that he's done nothing wrong and that he himself is the victim and I think that is also part what's fueling this kind of paranoia in the White House is that people are generally afraid that Trump is going to throw them under the bus because he's done it so much in the past in depositions for example we've seen that he's blamed other people for things that he himself is being accused of so it's almost like you're seeing people trying to get out ahead of this and you know just based on one that exchange that he had with Rudy Giuliani for example calling him a baby even when Rudy Giuliani was virtually the only one defending him during that weekend that the Access Hollywood tape dropped it just shows that loyalty is really a one-way street for the president I can tell you it's an unfair and inaccurate attack because babies can't do television interviews like we've never had a baby on this show because they don't speak John yes they don't speak they're not good for interview what about the question Natasha race is such an intriguing question I saw you vigorously nodding your head as you were known to do on this set from time to time Natasha raised an intelligent and interesting question why would you lie to your own lawyer I wonder if we put that question to you I think he resents the dependence the same the same thing goes on with the baby thing and then he goes off and he gives his intent he goes off and he says in an interview that yes I fired him because of the investigation I wanted to kill he makes me he gives his intent in a public proceeding under tape and you might ask why and there the comparison of the Shakespeare Shakespeare has this quote guilt spills his self for fear of being spilt he can't keep it to himself he has to say it he knows everybody knows it or he fears he does we talked about the paranoia in this book that he exhibits and he talks about they're out to get me and so forth and he helps them get him he wants to it's sort of the thing he wants to be caught and he has been caught in a way the polls are indicating the nation doesn't buy his stories anymore and they know he's lying he's in a very dangerous place and as a kid you know you'd see these movies with the walls and the ceilings and everything coming in well he perceives that whether or not it's true and it's becoming true because and that leaves it I'm only gonna interrupt you because as is the case around here we have more breaking news the New York Times is reporting I'm being told at this moment that Bob Mueller's lawyers are basically open to some written answers from Donald Trump this is crossing the wire right now they're calling it a quote interim measure and this reporting appears I want to caution appears to be based on characterizations not from molars folks who aren't confirming it on the record but from a characterization from the Trump White House again I'm going to read from the New York Times here for your response it says essentially the special counsel will accept written answers and president Trump on questions about whether his campaign conspired on Russian election interference this says mr. Miller's office told Trump's lawyers in a letter according to quote two people briefed on it they don't identify the sources but later it says they have dangled written answers there's a possibility mr. Miller's team quote appears receptive to this as an interim measure that would be Russia conspiracy not obstruction and it might not forestall an ultimate subpoena which we saw in the star Clinton matter your reaction my reaction is that's terrific because these will be focused questions and when he answers it as it's as true or false a statement whether he was saying it orally or it's written down 100 lawyers can sit there and write this thing but if they fail to answer the question there'll be a follow-up just like there would be in a true interview so there's going to be a statement and they can't get away from it right and I urge your view of this story well it's why it's a it's a meaningful attempt on the part of Muller it seems to me to meet him more than halfway right question why is a lie he lies to everybody first of all he said why does he lie yeah because that's what he does Fish gotta swim Birds gotta fly yes a law and it's you think it's in his nature I do I do of course I do but there's also the problem of what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive because you know well told our children tell the truth it's easier to remember than all the lies that can be told and I think that part of the problem that mr. Trump is in now he's got so many versions out there of what he did and why he did it that it must be hard to keep track of exactly hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
