did you see this incredible story about him the other day Kent hare because he's also the minister of people with disabilities who was meeting with people who suffered from thalidomide you remember what that was it was a drug that pregnant moms took and it had terrible effects on their babies they were born without limbs or with tiny limbs it's a tragedy in so many ways how can you feel anything but sympathy and sorrow and love for such people and surely can tear himself would be able to commiserate to empathize he's a quadriplegic man himself but here's what he actually said and did this is according to Fiona Samson and others in the thalidomide survivor's group they told the CBC and I quote in response to members of the group reading it really heartfelt testimonials Minister hair apropos of nothing commented well you don't have it as bad today as adults as you did when you were kids said Samson a human rights lawyer and chair of float amide survivors task group then he went on to say well you don't have it so bad everyone in Canada has a sob story you don't have it so bad shut up with your sob stories now in a very small way there's something underneath all that to admire here's Kant here who has overcome great physical difficulties himself and he's telling others to emphasize the positive and do their best and move on courage encouragement hope but that's actually not how we did it did it he didn't encourage or challenge or inspire with his words he could have done that he should have done that but instead he browbeat and insulted and demeaned oh shut up you whiners you see I mean there's a fine line there he could have said let's all be positive look at me look what I would see like he could have been positive but he said I'll shut up with your sob stories I don't think he used the word shut up but you saw what Fiona said but but they're they're not sob stories there's some fool in of my victims it's about the worst thing to happen to someone that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to right to watch the daily show every day including always to interview today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
