and I was gym Erzberg he's a media economist from the New York Times who himself has reported extensively on michael cohen mister Ruttenberg welcome back to the show thanks Chuck so here let's talk about Michael Cohen's world outside of Trump he has been a taxicab guy for years what does that mean in New York City well you know it's funny because it sounds a very small time but a what what Michael Cohen specialized in was owning taxi medallions and taxi medallion so the licenses taxis have to ride to be operating on the streets of New York City and they're worth a lot of money their value has gone down but you know we're talking at their height hundreds of thousands of dollars so it was a very cash rich business and so that's something investigators are looking at now is how he came to have all those medallions and whenever you keep looking at Cohen's past there is a lot of people that come from Eastern Europe a lot of Russian those folks with ties to the old Soviet Union look they're just associations they nobody knows for sure what they mean but there's quite a few of them walk me through some of them well he does have a Ukrainian family background right and he so that's that's just key I think he would as possible as emigrated from Ukraine correct yes so he has some natural associations but you mentioned the sadder deal you know but funnily enough I don't know if you remember last Friday when he was showing outside of the outside wait when he was supposed to be in trial on Friday he didn't go to court he was outside with some friends one of those people has been identified as being connected to a Russian oligarch it's kind of the world he lives in very and that's part of that the New York that Michael Kohn was operating in but we also know that it happens to be a world that investigators are looking at in relation to what they're looking at mr. Trump's campaign regarding any connections to Russia now there's an interesting story and how Michael Cohen got on Donald Trump's radar and frankly it's a very trumpian story it actually is very familiar to me as I've been researching people who have worked for him over the years of how he got on the radar tell me the story so the story and and I'm gonna I'm gonna say one caveat this is the first known interaction reporter continues right yes but there was a big interaction where Donald Trump had a a revolt on a condo board in a building where Michael Cohen also owned apartments and his family owned apartments and Michael Cohen rather than sticking with the condo board side to it with then citizen Donald Trump helps undermine me at this sort of condo board uprising by the way this city is known for dramatic co-op and condo board politicking but not quite like this and helps Donald Trump kind of squash this rebellion and forever solidifies himself as a loyalist for Donald Trump the other thing that I assume is what has investigators interested in Michael Cohen is it it seems as if Donald Trump had a habit and and others can decide what the motivation was but he doesn't run away from doing business deals with people that may have questionable backgrounds in the past and Michael Cohen would be the person that would interact with that it seems that there are a string of people like that exactly but I would say you know interestingly you think about it think about it this way though Donald Trump has to use very serious lawyers throughout his or used to have to use them throughout his real estate empire you can't just hire a street brawl and guy like Michael Cohen to figure out a very complicated bankruptcy or a complicated real estate deal so for all the lawyers might Donald Trump had he needed someone like Michael Cohen who isn't one of those people who can work in those gray or areas which any real estate Titan has to at least have a great understanding and facility with how concerned is Michael Cohen about this investigation you get the sense that that folks around him are very concerned I mean how he says he would take a bullet for the president is he is he prepared for where this could head well right the question now is would he take an indictment for the president and and that's a big question there's all reporting all reporting has it that he is very concerned that the president is very concerned and the people around the president are concerned because for everything we're talking about he's the keeper of the secrets that he's the keeper of the part of from Empire that's in the shadows it's not public Michael Cohen though is he has he seems to have escaped he's escaped or not gotten you know not done anything illegal enough to get caught in the past why is this time different or has he just gotten lucky well you know that it's one thing when you're doing deals as a New York guy you know rocket you know it's kind of wheeling and dealing it's an entirely other matter when your client is now the President of the United States or even at one point the nominee the Republican nominee for the presidency the stakes are so different we're seeing this throughout the part of the story that I'm reporting is people who operated again in the shadows maybe cut some corners maybe worse there wasn't any real scrutiny on it now it's you it's as much scrutiny as you could possibly have in the entire world and it's scrutiny that he never had to worry about before Donald Trump became a politician right it scrutiny that he could swat away he could threaten away right right and now you have a bigger someone you can't threaten Uncle Sam fair enough I think a lot of us who have covered Donald Trump over the years have been on the receiving end of Michael Cohen phone call so we know what that is like anyway Jim Merton Berg New York Times thank you very much much appreciate you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
