Laura: WELL, DID YOU SEE THE FIREWORKS DURING THE QUESTION OF THE DEPUTY AG? ROD ROSENSTEIN OVERSEEING THE HESITATE TO VENT THEIR FRUSTRATIONS WITH HIS HANDLING OF THE PROBE. YOU WROTE THE MEMO SAYING COMEY SHOULD BE FIRED AND SIGNED THE FISA EXTENSION FOR CARTER RESCUED MORE SO THAN JEFF SESSIONS BECAUSE YOU MADE DECISIONS AFFECTING BOTH PRONGS OF THIS INVESTIGATION. WHY HAVEN'T YOU DONE THAT? I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WERE IT APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO RECUSE, I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY. IF YOU HAVE EVIDENCE OF WRONGDOING BY ANY MEMBER OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, PRESENT IT TO THE DAMN GRAND JURY. IF YOU HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THIS PRESIDENT ACTED INAPPROPRIATELY, WHATEVER YOU GOT. FINISH THE HELL UP! THIS COUNTRY IS BEING TORN APART. THE BEST THING WE CAN DO IS FINISH IT APPROPRIATELY DOES REACH A CONCLUSION. EVIDENCE. DID YOU READ THE FISA APPLICATION BEFORE YOU SIGNED? I WON'T COMMENT. WHY ARE YOU KEEPING INFORMATION FROM CONGRESS? I AM NOT KEEPING ANY INFORMATION FROM CONGRESS THAT IS APPROPRIATE. YOU ARE THE BOSS, MR. ROSENSTEIN. THAT'S CORRECT. MY JOB IT IS TO RESPOND TO YOUR CONCERNS. I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS. I THINK THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WILL SAY OTHERWISE. YOU ARE USING THIS TO ATTACK ACT TINGED. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WON'T GIVE US WHAT YOU ASKED FOR. THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. IT IS ACCURATE. WE HAVE CAUGHT YOU HIDING INFORMATION. Laura: ANYONE ELSE GET NERVOUS DURING THAT EXCHANGE? JOINING MEAR ANALIS ANDEH JOINING MEAR ANALIS ANDE JOINING MEAR ANALIS ANDY JOINING MEAR ANALIS ANDY M JOINING MEAR ANALIS ANDY McC JOINING MEAR ANALIS ANDY McCAR JOINING MEAR ANALIS ANDY McCARTY JORDAN'S QUESTIONING WHEN YOU FOUND TO BE BADGERING. I WAS WATCHING AT MY RADIO STUDIO. I WINSED. WHEN YOU HAVE TO INTERRUPT A WITNESS IT MAKES YOUR CASE NOT LOOK THAT STRONG. LET HIM HAVE THE ANSWER. I THINK HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT NOT HAVING ENOUGH TIME. PART OF JORDAN? IT WASN'T A FATAL MISTAKE. HE WENT TO THE TEDDY KENNEDY SCHOOL OF CROSS-EXAMINATION. YOU ASK A HOSTILE QUESTION AND INTERRUPT THE PERSON YOU ARE QUESTIONING. MY OBJECTION IS NOT TO THE BASHING ROSENSTEIN IS SOMETHING ANDY SPOKE TO SEVERAL TIMES IN AGO. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS THE ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY TO ORDER ROD ROSENSTEIN TO TURN OVER EVERYTHING TO THE CONGRESS. IF HE DIDN'T, AND ROSENSTEIN DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT, HE COULD RESIGN OR IF HE REFUSED, THE PRESIDENT COULD FIRE HIM. WHY HASN'T HE DONE THAT? Laura: LET'S ASK ANDY. WHAT IS THE DELAY? WHY WON'T THE PRESIDENT SAY TOROSE ROSE ENOUGH OF THESE CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS THAT ARE WE ARE COMPELLING YOU TO RELEASE THE DOCUMENTS. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO RELEASE THE DOCUMENTS. THAT WAS CLEAR TODAY. WHY WON'T THE PRESIDENT DEMAND THEY BE RELEASED AND GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD? THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION, THE GREAT IRONY OF THE HEARING WAS MY FRIEND JIM JORDAN LAYING INTO ROD ROSENSTEIN SAYING YOU ARE THE BOSS. THESE PEOPLE WORK FOR YOU. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IS THAT ROSENSTEIN WORKS FOR TRUMP. PRECISELY THE POINT YOU MAKE IS TRUE. TRUMP CAN ORDER THIS. WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS THAT HE GOTTEN ADVICE. I DON'T THINK IT'S PARTICULARLY GOOD ADVICE. BECAUSE HAS BEEN UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR OBSTRUCTION AND BECAUSE THE CRITICS OF TRUMP CONFLATED IN THE PUBLIC MIND THE REPUBLICAN PERSUIT OF AGENTS AND MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION. IF TRUMP ACT TO FORCE DISCLOSURE AND HELP CONGRESS HE IS OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE. I THINK THAT'S NUTS. Laura: I GET IT. I THINK THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE AT. Laura: THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT. JOHN, SO MANY THINGS IN THIS HEARING THAT WERE WILD. ONE WAS WHEN HE WAS ASKED, QUESTION ABOUT DID YOU READ THIS FISA WARRANT? HE SAID YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. HE SAID I HAVE 100,000 EMPLOYEES. BUT WANTS TO ROOT OUT ANY CORRUPTION. HE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T READ THE WARRANT OR GLANCED OVER SO HE CAN'T REMEMBER THE SPECIFICS. THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS MOVING SO SLOW. AT THIS POINT, THE DOJ HAS TO STOP WITH THE GLACIER PERFORMANCE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO SPEED IT UP AND GET THE ANSWERS OUT THERE. Laura: AND GOWDY WENT CRAZY A QUESTION. BUT TO TAKE HIS TIME TO MAKE SURE HE GOT QUOTED AND THE SOUND BITE WAS USED ON MOST EVENING NEWSCAST. CABLE AND SOCIAL MEDIA: GET THIS THING WRAPPED UP. WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG? PRESSING ANOTHER MATTER ABOUT PETER STRZOK. I WANT TO PLAY THAT AND GET WHY DID YOU TELL PETER STRZOK NOT TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS YESTERDAY. I ASKED HIM IF HE EVER COMMUNICATED WITH GLENN SYMBOLS. SIMPSON. HE SAID I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION. WHY? I DIDN'T GIVE PETER STRZOK ANY INSTRUCTIONS. HOW DO I KNOW? THAT WORKS FOR YOU, IT DOESN'T WORK FOR US. Laura: I DON'T THINK ROSENSTEIN CAME ALL WELL. HE CAME OFF AS DEFENSIVE AND MEAN TO ME IN THE MEDIA. WELCOME TO THE BIG-LEAGUES. THE DEPUTY AG IS HOT RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE ALL OF THESE PEOPLE 2 THIS IS THE BIGGEST CASE THE RUSSIA CASE AND THE HILLARY EMAIL CASE, THEY DOVE TAIL TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THIS AGENT. HE HAD A DUTY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED. I THINK HE DID BETTER THAN TWO IMPORTANT THINGS. ROSENSTEIN MADE TWO POINTS. NUMBER 1, I AM NOT THE ONE AND NOBODY AT DOJ AS OPPOSEED TO THE FBI, NOBODY IN ROSENSTEIN'S SHOP TOLD PETER STRZOK WHAT TO SAY OR TO DO WITH THE REDACTIONS INCLUDING THE LATEST OUTRAGEOUS REDACTION. WHEN HE WAS TOLD THERE WERE REDACTIONS HE BROUGHT IN A U.S. ATTORNEY FROM CHICAGO. FOR MANY YEARS ON AND OFF, THERE HAS BEEN A ROGUE ELEMENT IN THE FBI LEADERSHIP THAT OBSTRUCTS THESE KINDS OF INVESTIGATIONS. OBVIOUSLY IT'S OUTRAGE. HA TEXT MESSAGE WAS NOT SENT TO THE CONGRESS. THE QUESTION IS: WHAT WILL BE DONE ABOUT IT? I THINK THE DOJ SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Laura: ANDY, ANY REPURCUSSIONS FOR WHAT WAS DONE? I WILL TAKE CARE OF IT, MEANING INTENT TO BE A PROBLEM. TRUMP WON'T BE A PROBLEM. THAT DOESN'T GO TO THE CONGRESS? OF COURSE. THIS IS THE PROBLEM I THINK THAT ROSENSTEIN HAS. I THINK, FOR EXAMPLE, I WONDERED HIS ANSWERS WERE SINCIBLE BUT SENSIBLE BUT THE SMIRK ON HIS FACE WAS OFF PUTTING. YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE CREDIBLE AND SAY AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE GIVING YOU ALL OF THIS COOPERATION. WHEN WE FIND SOMEBODY WHO WITH HOLDS STUFF, WE DON'T DISCIPLINE THEM. Laura: WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR FROM OFFICIALS: MAKE SURE HILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T GET PROSECUTED AND THEY WERE WHY ISN'T THIS GUY ROSENSTEIN ANGRY? HEAD COACHERSHIP POSITIONS. I HELD LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AND I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT. Laura: THE BUCK STOPS HERE? I GUESS NOT. THEY LET STRZOK OUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. YES. IT'S NOT LIKE HE IS GONE. HE IS OVER THERE. Laura: BUT HE WAS MOVED TO HUMAN RESOURCES. WE NEED HUMAN RESOURCES.
