well what a surprising diplomatic spat Justin Trudeau versus the new kingdoms Saudi Arabia you know there's a lot of foreign affairs files in her burning dumpster fires under Justin Trudeau obviously the most important one being our bilateral relationship with the United States including NAFTA other relationships like with the world's largest democracy India but now there's a serious diplomatic row with the Saudis and who better to talk to than our friend Manny Montenegrin or the president of think sharp who joins us to hell via Skype Manny great to see you again good to see you as well thank you you know I I just go down the list of countries that we have had spats with I tell you Justin Trudeau certainly put himself forward as someone who would have Canada come back to the world stage unlike the humiliations of the Stephen Harper era Stephen Harper is the one who was the cool professional Trudeau is mucking up everything left and right well it seemed so I mean this diplomatic war with Saudi Arabia I simply can't get my head around and I've been looking at the news reports and and you don't get the facts so I when you're confused about something Ezra at least start with the facts try to understand the facts and somewhere you might find some logical conclusion or logical understanding I don't know if your viewers know but neither of the two right body or his sister samara body are Canadian citizens or share a dual citizenship they're not even Canadian and they are being processed under the laws of Saudi Arabia and I don't know why Canada has any interests in two individuals that are going through a legal process in a foreign jurisdiction that is no way similar to Canada foreign a judicial system so I start there and I wonder why are we involved in this in the first place and I have a theory on that and let me put my cards on the table many I'm critical of Saudi Arabia for a number of reasons mainly they are an extremist Islamic theocracy with no civil rights the Sharia is the basis of their constitution the the Koran rather all right and I know this Raef Badawi was sort of a democracy activist blogger and so I'm sympathetic towards him as I would be with any Chinese democracy activist or an Iranian democracy activist I think because Canada took in as for refuge his wife and Saif Haydar so she's become a Canadian political forget I'm sympathetic I'm sympathetic absolutely I'm similar but I think you're spot on being politically sympathetic and and making a public demand that a Saudi national have different legal treatment I don't mean I think I think there is a place for Canada to be a moral exemplar and to push for human rights but obviously this wasn't done right it's I mean what do you explain I mean Saudi Arabia has come down like a ton of bricks kansian dispatching the the Canadian ambassador home canceling flights withdrawing Saudi students from our med schools you know threatening to cancel imports like it it's it's a real thunderclap diplomatically what was the precise thing that you think triggered it was that that that that tweet from the Foreign Affairs Department well absolutely the tweet was a public tweet humiliating the Kingdom and normally these channels are done privately and communications are made privately to make a public tweet and to pick out the Kingdom really alarms me there are as well if we look at it there are seven billion people on this planet about 6 billion don't enjoy what we enjoy in Canada that is the right of individual rights the right of our own liberty our right to assemble or write the freedom of speech so there are a lot of countries you know one upwards of over a hundred countries that do not enjoy the rights of Canadians enjoy why single Saudi Arabia we have to ask why and these are not I mean if they were dual citizen I'd be strongly supportive there are millions of people around the world that are either being killed prosecuted or in jailed for doing absolutely nothing in these very barbaric countries as rye put to you the following Mexico Canada has and I don't understand but Canada has an asylum process for Mexicans we have accepted many Mexicans under the asylum process basically saying that the government is a threat to its people we don't hear the Prime Minister speaking about human rights in Mexico we don't hear about that millions are trying to escape from Mexico and the human rights violations there we don't hear about your brand Iran is going through a crisis right now and the Prime Minister is getting close to our end there are there are there are riots and there are protests to get some rudimentary fundamental rights in Iran and we're silent China as we know is a a terrible jurisdiction when it comes to human rights but but our Prime Minister was pretty cozy with him the biggest one I mean a night when I tweeted this and that is Cuba I had gone I've gone to Cuba once and I was heartbroken to see these beautiful 11 million people basically enslaved in a country no freedom of speech and they are they're dissidents are jailed they're dissidents are flogged and some killed but but our Prime Minister is very close to Cuba so how does this Prime Minister speak on human rights when he allows in fact loves jurisdictions and and and and and that are abusive to human rights but but but picks out Saudi Arabia and I think that's why Saudi Arabia moves very quickly yeah I think you're right I think sandy moved quickly because I mean I I find this one a tough one because I'm sympathetic to Raef Badawi he's a democracy blogger who was flogged by by a theocratic dictatorship so I'm sympathetic to him he y'see in cancer you go ahead yeah you and I would be Rafe in Saudi Arabia you and I would be subject to that so of course we do but we but but there is a a bigger point here in Saudi Arabia they have laws like we have laws they have and I've looked at this they have their m130 that we have our that we've passed as emotion but they've put teeth into their law but if you speak poorly about Islam you speak poorly about the Muslim culture you will be in prison and you will be flogged and you will be so that is they any what I don't understand is why our prime minister who has holds himself out health and suffer to be knowledgable about Islam to be knowledgeable about the culture completely misses what's really happening in these jurisdictions she does know what Sharia law means he does know that Saudi Arabia has 32 million people that all must be Muslim you cannot be a citizen of Saudi Arabia unless you're Muslim you cannot be a citizen if you say there are no churches there are no there are no any other forms of religious practice in Saudi Arabia so it's clear right so how do we how we confused about this and and our prime minister is you be seen I mean pictures we've seen him understanding Islam and understand Sharia law it clearly tells me he doesn't understand it and he shouldn't be virtually signaling about it here's a few of my thoughts because on the one hand I want to acknowledge the rare time and Canada speaks out against an Islamic theocracy like that's sort of a miracle but I have to ask that you do why Saudi Arabia not Iran because we know that Justin Trudeau is affectionate towards Iran his brother did a propaganda video with the Iran's state media called the new great game like his brother worked with Iran propaganda there are MPs in Trudeau's caucus who are trying to rebuild diplomatic and business ties so is this some sort of move against Iran as you point out China Cuba horrific places why there's Saudi Arabia chosen I'd like I'm curious but also it's that obsession with Twitter and social media justin trudeau starts so many policy disasters with a careless tweet like his announcement to the world that we asked longer enforce our borders I think maybe that's what bugged the Saudis well I think you're signaling tweet is what started this battle well I know I think I I'll go a little bit further I think the Saudis wanted to send a worldwide message do not interfere into our own governance and it so happened that the who did they pick on who did he send a message to well once again our Prime Minister has demonstrated incredible weakness in the world and they just jumped on it like a cat jumping on a ball or or but the saudi arabia sees a very weak and vulnerable prime minister a very weak canada and you've already stated the reasons why the offence to india the war with with the President of the United States over NAFTA and and the embarrassment in China so they know and that Canada is weak and if you want to send a world a message out you use Canada what I'm alarmed about the most is is how we has Canada become the you the UK has stepped aside and will not get into this battle how can the country that created the Magna Carta the country that's shoulder to shoulder with Canada for since our inception is not standing me beside Canada it's not Canada that they're not standing by side it's a prime minister you know I think you're right I think this was a strategic choice by Saudi Arabia to smack Canada so hard poor encourage a Lay's ultra as they would say in French yeah to teach a lesson to everyone else you know I don't know if you remember mani a few weeks ago some Iranian dictator mused about some threat to America and Donald Trump and all capital letters tweet right on the screen here and it basically said don't you ever threaten America or you will have more you couldn't imagine like it was a stunning tweet that written in all caps as you can see on the screen right now it's as if Trump was shouting it yes you know what I would be scared I would be scared where is Trudeau he didn't even react I mean he was on vacation or maybe just got a vacation he went Wow great in Vancouver it everyone knows he's the world's weakest leader well he's demonstrated that for two years I mean like the world takes notice when Justin Trudeau goes to important events and he shows his socks he does a dress up he's referred to as little potato in China the world notices that there's a weak weak leader there I mean and the embarrassment with India trying to blame India for Canada bringing a Canadian terrorists to India and trying to blame India was an embarrassment and so there are Apple example our own country has found this Prime Minister but incomprehensible failure I mean there are lists of failures during the there during the one year investigation of the of the ethics commissioner on his $200,000 free trip to the private island the ethics commissioner found that his his excuse or his evidence that this was a friend not credible we have we have an adjudicator of fact finally our prime minister not credible we have another the attorney are a general binding class of failures there so the world knows that this is not a very strong prime minister and he should not be waiting in into areas where he does not have the strength of UK USA or Canada behind him this is very alarming yeah you know it's interesting Saudi Arabia Believe It or Not sells oil to Canada yeah which is so weird to me it's when I first learned that years ago I was shocked I thought Canada is a major net oil exporter because of the oil sands why are we importing oil from anyone let alone from conflict oil regimes well because we don't have a pipeline going east and Trudeau and his liberal friends and Montreal especially sunk a massive pipeline project called energy East it was a private sector shovel-ready infrastructure project fifteen point seven billion dollar jobs project like imagine how the fifteen billion to build a pipe and it was stopped not only did I kill a bunch of jobs not only did it keep the oil price in Western Canada depressed but again it was the best thing ever done for Saudi Arabia maybe I mean it I don't think that that deal is salvageable now because I don't think any sane pipeline company would proceed in Canada under Trudeau but what a shame we don't have the energy East pipeline providing us with an alternative source of oil to Saudi Arabia and Algeria and Angola and the rest of the conflict world countries selling into our country last word to you that's exactly right if there was a bona fide intent to to to message human rights we would have created the energy East as a national security interest as he did with TransCanada pipeline TransCanada pipeline and moves oil from Alberta to the to China or whatever consumer the energy East was a perfect national treasure that we could have created to get off Saudi oil had that been done and had other acts been done and then speak strongly on human rights it would have been more effective but there is none and there is no strategy everything that this government does from its selfies and its socks and it's it's it's trade war it's simply virtual signaling to get you know what I'll call low hanging votes in Canada these patriotic votes and and it's it's a reflection of how poor this government is doing yeah what a laugh and Krista Freeland keeps boasting that she was voted diplomat of the year by some foreign policy magazine what a joke mani it's always great to catch up with you I really enjoy our talks and by the way there's
