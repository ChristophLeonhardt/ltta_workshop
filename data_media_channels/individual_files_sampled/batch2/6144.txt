so a video has been discovered on the Daily Caller they posted it now they didn't do it after Charlottesville they did it before Charlottesville to be fair and so they were advocating for a murder of protesters earlier not after I'm just being fair and it's a compilation video that I'm going to show you in a second of of people running over protesters and this was in January of 2017 so Trump is gonna take charge and they're showing you basically a how-to manual for how to run over and kill protesters that would protest Trump and just to be clear in the article they explained that it is quote cars plowing through protesters and it says quote study the technique it may prove useful in the next four years so let's stay right there now I want to bring in the video this is a compilation they put together it's graphic so yes sorry warning so it'sit's longer on their website but it's basically celebrating if anybody's protesting Trump this is what you do to them so that is not only on the Daily Caller it's also on Fox Nation I'm sorry not daily wired Daily Caller that's very important okay Daily Caller is run by Tucker Carlson Tucker Carlson also top host on Fox News also featured on Fox Nation when when I saw this article first on media they still had not taken down the video war the article yeah still to this day and by the way it's not that hey they forgot to take it down that they forgot that they gave a how-to manual are murder people earlier and Oh after Charlottesville they should have enough sense to take it down remember several Muslim radicals already did that same same tactic yeah in in Europe they did it over and over again and the Daily Caller so lift it up terrorist by another name so they're like oh well you know we hate it when Muslim radicals do it but when white supremacist radicals do it will show them how they literally showed him how there's more quotes from the video they said if you're easily triggered stop watching now triggered by what murder and by the way they didn't even let you do that and then immediately they show more left-wing people being killed by cars and go ha too late in the video okay and and I want to remind you guys remember there was Republican legislators that try to pass bills in in the real world to run over protesters I'm gonna quote the Los Angeles Times for you from back in February of this fellow's bill proposed in North Dakota the bill still in committee would make it at the time it was still in committee would make it legal for drivers to run over protesters who are standing in a roadway clearing drivers of any liability as long as their action was unintentional so now that one was in the roadway and you had to have unintentionally murdered them okay but the guy who proposed the bill said well look if they're standing in a roadway they're pretty much terrorists and he said you should try to slow down first now luckily that did not pass North Dakota but it was close it was and and look I don't agree with people blocking the highways blocking the that is not the proper way to protest and when I say proper I mean we got to keep the roads clear for emergency vehicles it could be a nightmare if you're blocking okay but what that said for people who do happen to protest in a way that blocks the streets there is no justification for running them over under any circumstance and if you sit there and criticize the behavior of radical Islamic terrorists which I totally understand you should right you can't turn around and make excuses for others who modown individuals who are protesting in a way that you don't like murder is unacceptable in any and all circumstances regardless of the demographic who's carrying out the murder okay and that's the thing this is this is what I have finally come to the conclusion with we can't work we keep fighting fairly right we fight fair we want to be accountable when we're wrong we want to make sure that we represent both sides fairly we don't want to live we don't want to throw around propaganda we don't want to generalize about entire groups of people and we keep having these discussions as if the other side is interested in having a fair debate about it they're not interested in a fair debate they're not interested in principled political positions or ideology they're hateful right and so we keep trying to reason with them and negotiate with them and I'm done I'm done negotiating okay they're bad people they don't actually care about terrorism because if they genuinely cared about terrorism they would take you know the issue of white supremacy in America a little more seriously but they don't they don't so let me have two quick things to that one is now I understand why they made the insane charges that they did and why they keep saying because for the millionth time row it's projection so they're like oh are you gonna call it Muslim radicals who run people over of course we are we hold ahead what monster would be in favor of that so I'm a guy who left Islam they'd killed me first okay I can't stand my Muslim radicals I hate Muslim radicals I don't want them killing anybody that's so obvious but why would they even make that Church because in their mind look at the video they put up they think well we wouldn't condemn it if it happened on our side would even encourage it so they must think like we do it's great if it happens quote-unquote on our side and in their side in their view of the world is Christians whites right-wingers whatever that's us right or wrong fundamentalists are not fundamentalist and so you guys must think your side is black people Latinos Muslims or whatever know our side is reasonable people the people of America the civilians etc your side is fundamentalists yeah their side is is you know they have the brains of cavemen right like all colored people all Mexicans bad all Muslims bad all anyone who's not white bad right they're unable to differentiate between bad people in a community and good people in a community okay there are terrible white people and there are also great white people there are terrible Muslims and great Muslims there are terrible Armenians and great Armenians every community has terrible people in them but they like black and white they want every community to be portrayed as terrible violence savages but when it comes to their people right when it comes to the white community I don't know they're always right they can literally run people over because they disagree with their political ideology and that's okay murdering people with a different political view is okay okay so last piece of wonderful hypocrisy for the right-wing they claim the left as identity politics they just did a march for white nationalists their whole movement is about white nationalism that is by definition identity politics no no yeah we get to do identity politics but if you guys say black people should have the same rights er gay people should have the same rights not more right same rights how dare you do identity politics you want to have everybody equal no you're the one doing identity politics and then freedom of speech the number one issue they claim to have why won't people let people speak why won't the colleges let people speak oh you're doing a counter protest of Nazis and fascists well no you had it coming where's your freedom of speech well I thought you guys were big freedom of speech advocates but when it's a protester you don't like so and by the way if you're a so-called moderate right winger let me flip the argument on you you have a responsibility to call out the fundamentalists and radicals in your ranks so if you're not out there writing blog posts doing videos doing everything you can to condemn those right-wingers in Charlottesville to condemn the white nationalists to condemn the Daily Caller to condemn Fox Nation to condemn Tucker Carlson if you're not calling them out you're just as guilty is there that's your logic not mine okay live by your own logic so if you're not doing it right now you're guilty forever support independent media come join us at the Young Turks TYT Network calm /join
