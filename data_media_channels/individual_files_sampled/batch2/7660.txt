politics in the United States feel a lot more like reality television and it could be because we have a former reality television host as our president however if you take a look at the type of television programming most Americans are watching these days you'll kind of understand why someone like Trump ended up becoming our president in the first place now recently there was this huge scandal huge controversy I should say regarding the season finale of The Bachelor hold now the controversy was the fact that the guy that all the women are trying to marry his name is Ari Lewin Dyk jr. he made a decision to propose to one of the contestants and then later changed his mind and then proceeded to pursue another contestant and then after he did that decided to go back to the previous woman and people were upset about it now he dumped Lauren Burnham and proposed to Becca cuff Rijn okay Lew and Ike later I'm sorry lion dyke that's how you pronounce his name lion Dyke later later questioned his choice and broke up with Hough Rijn to pursue Burnham again and then we have a bunch of fun screenshots of what occurred because we can't play you the original video due to copyright reasons so hopefully okay so look I insisted that we do this story and I'll tell you why partly because I very randomly caught ten minutes of this live last night okay and it's because last night we'd watch the Oscars so it was still on ABC now I was going to watch John Oliver show which was brilliant by the way so summer television is fantastic now HBO Netflix absolutely killing it Amazon Hulu and others as well right but then you've got this dumpster fire and so first of all I want to be clear that I'm not trying to judge the people who watch this stuff it'll seem that way but so let me tell you ahead of time I've done your drug so my wife and I used to watch The Bachelor I don't remember if we watched one or two seasons and when I was you know about to go to watch my show and this was on I got stuck and I did watch it for 10 minutes it was like a train wreck and you couldn't look away but the reason I wanted to do this story is we've got to look away this is hurting the country it's emotional porn and it's so let me explain this scene that I saw so they go back and forth a little bit and and you know I find I don't give a damn about any of these people and they're how all half actors right so he was he couldn't decide who was in fact I remember I watched crashing from HBO so I caught a little piece of this and then when it was thought I was gonna go to John Oliver's show that I caught another piece of it right so I sold a little bit of like drama which was he gonna go I was like that one I lasted for like 15 seconds I'm like I don't care which one he's gonna go with okay let's watch this right did I come back and he's breaking up with a girl that he said yes to who cares who cares who cares except for she started crying and weeping and they wouldn't stop following her with the camera why would they that's exactly what they want that's what the producers of the show want that's what you know and again I I'm not judging either but that's what the audience reacts to is attached to they want the drama it's a soap opera essentially exactly but and the people who were involved in the soap opera I get it they signed up for it I I know that but they're also people and they got caught in this play and now kind of a zoo or a Coliseum and at that moment she is genuinely upset and he won't leave the house and I'm positive the producers are telling him don't leave the house she's asking him to leave if she's an emotional wreck and he won't leave just to rub it in a little bit because we want more crying for the Colosseum right she goes into the bathroom so the cameras can't follow her but they won't take off her Mike so you see her you hear her sobbing and sobbing and you've got this and and I could feel like the audience kind of loving it and it made me sick inside so I have numbers to back up the fact that the audience did love it even though Twitter erupted with a ton of criticism so the this was this 20 second season finale of The Bachelor and it hit new season highs and gave ABC a win in the key demo so it averaged a 2.2 rating in adults 18 to 49 and 7.8 million viewers so a lot of people were watching it broke all sorts of records for The Bachelor specifically and I look I am actually kind of surprised by your commentary Jake because this isn't new I mean they've always done this it doesn't matter if they're weeping and crying that's considered good TV and they don't gonna take the mic off that's like you know getting rid of the one component that the audience keeps coming back for but what I will say is what I'm noticing in government right now and it never it didn't hit me until recently was that the way Trump conducts things is very similar to what you would see on a reality show so for instance and correct me if I'm wrong I don't remember Obama having these highly publicized and highly televised negotiation sessions with members of Congress now one might argue that its transparency and it's a good thing but the way that Trump carries himself makes it very apparent to me that it's theater right it's you know he likes the production of it all he likes the drama of it all and he's done it time and time again it's never meant to negotiate actual policy and lead to real solutions it's always meant for the drama people in the media latch on to it and they debated and they talked about it non-stop meantime they're deregulating you know the environmental protections that we have so that's the part of it that makes me worried because now society has devolved in not just the type of television that we're watching but the way that we govern and yeah that's concerning so I think there's just a couple of differences one is we all knew that it was a not unfortunately not we all right but a lot of us knew is a play before and when you see amorosa crying in a reality show you'd have to be the biggest sucker in the world to think that that's real right so she's an actress and she's her job is to go piss off everybody on the set and then have them cry and her crying and it's so like why are we still watching it's so fake it's so fake right okay now in in this case I look again she signed up for it etc but that was genuine she's hot she's not going and be like oh my god I'm so upset later I'll make millions when I become the Bachelorette and etc which probably will happen by the way okay but she was in bawling in the bathroom and the Coliseum is tea on the edge like oh oh this is good and he just I don't know maybe it's partly because I he's happy to see it right and it was gut-wrenching and I didn't want us to be entertained by that and then to your point Ana look at what the country has become right so we got so used to it that we put a reality show host as our leader as the leader of the free world the most powerful man on earth and yes Obama from time to time would bring in leaders from both parties and it was totally fake they would have a fake conversation nothing would get negotiated but Trump is a showman so he he agrees with the Democrats and Feinstein gets excited and this Schumer says we got a deal and then it turns out they don't have a deal then they go on camera and cry and Trump lied to me I didn't know it I mean they so we got were the frog in the boiling water we got used to the fake drama and the hysteria so much that we became you know we became a reality show and so we got to get out it's a dumpster fire we got to get out of this existence because it's hurting us it's hurting the whole country if you want to get the
