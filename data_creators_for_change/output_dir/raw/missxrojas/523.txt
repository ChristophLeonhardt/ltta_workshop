1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
the first time I took notice of

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,760
cheerleading was when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was watching</font>

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">sabrina the teenage witch as a child now</font>

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,970
you may remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> libby the bitch of a</font>

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">character</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was head of the cheering</font>

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,139
squad and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> valerie wanted to try out</font>

7
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,079
the cheerleading and Sabrina was like no

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,279
you shouldn't try out for cheerleading

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,199
so i use my sneaky magic and it was all

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> friends might want to do</font>

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,439
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you and that's no</font>

12
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,890
reason to stop them and when Valerie

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,720
eventually does try out for the

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,939
cheerleading squad Sabrina tries out

15
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,360
with her now Sabrina makes what we would

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,170
define as a tip of herself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I always</font>

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that episode was quite funny</font>

63
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,270
for cheerleaders who I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you've been</font>
