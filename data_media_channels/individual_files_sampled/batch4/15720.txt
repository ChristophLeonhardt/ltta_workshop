hey folks remember that do rigueur chant from the left that kicked in on election night 2016 namely love Trump's hate well don't know about you but I'm not feeling a whole lot of love from the left these days and one of the biggest targets for really nasty really vile ad hominem attacks these days is Sarah Huckabee Sanders this woman has been mercifully attacked for her weight her looks her choice of wardrobe and even for the sound of her voice how immature can you get and the latest troll to toss a rock and Sarah was Jim Carrey who even attacked her Christianity amazing joining me now with more on the ongoing biker gang beat down on Sarah Huckabee Sanders is our LA bass rebel Amanda Head welcome again to rebel roundup Amanda thanks for having me always a pleasure my friend now Amanda there seems to be a real disconnect here for me how many times have we heard from the left that a person should not be judged on their skin color or their faith or their sex but when there is a conservative that they want to go after oh those provisos get tossed right out the window how do you make sense of such blatant hypocrisy well I think making sense of it I think that possibility has gone out the window and did a long time but you know that this is this seems to be the status quo for Hollywood now they they use any criticism of anyone within the Trump administration as an excuse to in very and often very petty and immature and superficial ways attack them and as you said Sarah Sanders is no exception Jim Carrey apparently disagrees with what she does for a living and that's he said something about you know this is a woman who makes it her mission to lie for I don't think he mentioned Trump but we know who he's talking about and then he posted this grotesque portrait of her and I made a comment about this on social media and someone countered that the reason that he he may such a grotesque portrayal of her is because he disagrees with her and what she does and if that's the case that's fine I agreed with her I disagreed with a lot of things that President Obama and his administration did but when you when you make attacks on people's appearance and you make superficial criticisms about them you muddy the waters and you atrophy your own skills and your own intellectual value to the conversation and and they don't seem to get that and they don't seem to care so at this point their intellectual contribution to any conversation is pretty much moot at this point hey that was an excerpt from my show rebel roundup where we discussed the week's top stories with your favorite rebels to see my show and more sign up to become a Premium Member today you
