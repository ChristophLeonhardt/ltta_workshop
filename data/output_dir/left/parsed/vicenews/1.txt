I feel like I'm on a mission fighting
for this our entire life
of course I don't play identity politics
but it is nice to see more women in
office I would be the first
african-american elected statewide in
Iowa I'm a former Special Victims
prosecutor running for Congress I was
very inspired by the me to movement
Trump won and that changed everything
for me
we need more progressive women to run
for office and women more pro of it I am
the woman of my dreams I've been happy
to take that question
makeup it is a pretty good day I'm gonna
go change in my car I actually give a
damn I get pumped up hold up
I just freaked out my camera I'm running
I'm running I'm running
oh boy
