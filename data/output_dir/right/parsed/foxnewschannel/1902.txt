>> HI, JULIE.
THE U.S. HAS ABOUT 2,000 GROUPS
ON THE GROUND IN SYRIA.
IT'S CLEAR THE PENTAGON WOULD
NOT LIKE TO GET DRAWN INTO THIS.
LAST NIGHT, I REACHED A SENIOR
U.S. DEFENSE OFFICIAL AFTER THE
STRIKE BEGAN TO ASK IF THE U.S.
MILITARY WAS BEING ASKED TO HELP
ISRAEL AND WAS TOLD THERE HAD
BEEN NO REQUEST FOR SUPPORT OR
ANY POLITICAL DECISION MADE AS
OF YET ABOUT THE U.S. MILITARY
GETTING FURTHER INVOLVED.
THE WHITE HOUSE JUST RELEASED
THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT.
"THE UNITED STATES CONDEMNS THE
IRANIAN REGIME'S PROVOCATIVE
ROCKET ATTACK FROM SYRIA AGAINST
ISRAELI CITIZENS.
WE STRONGLY SUPPORT ISRAEL'S
RIGHT TO ACT IN SELF-DEFENSE.
IRAN'S ISLAMIC REVOLUTION GUARD
BEARS FULL CONSEQUENCES FOR ITS
RECKLESS ACTIONS, AND WE CALL ON
THE I RGC INCLUDING HAS A LOT TO
TAKE NO FURTHER PROVOCATIVE
STEPS."

COMMITTEE.
>> WE KNOW IRAN IS ABLE TO
PENETRATE THE IRON DOME.
THEY FIRED 20 MISSILES.
SOME OF THEM GOT IN THE IRON
DOME.
ISRAEL RESPONDED WITH A VERY
STRONG RETALIATORY RESPONSE
AGAINST IRAN AND SYRIA.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT RON
IS IN SYRIA, THEY ARE IN IRAQ,
THEY ARE IN LEBANON, THAT'S WHAT
THEY'VE DONE WITH THE MONEY
TAKEN FROM THE SANCTIONS.
>> CAME AFTER A DAY
PRESIDENT TRUMP HOLD UP THE IRAN
NUCLEAR
-- INVITED TO ISRAEL ON AN
UNUSUAL TRIP GIVEN THAT ISRAEL
DOES NOT FALL UNDER CENTCOM, BUT
SYRIA DOES.
THEY WOULD NOT STAND BY AND
ALLOW IRRADIATING INFRASTRUCTURE
TO GROW UNCHECKED IN NEIGHBORING
SYRIA.
THE PAST SEVEN YEARS, JULIE,
ISRAEL HAS CARRIED OUT MORE THAN
