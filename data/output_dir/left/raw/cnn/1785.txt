1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,689
Twitter is saying it is not in the
business of policing political thought

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,370
or messaging and that's whether it's
coming from Republicans Democrats or

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,110
Vladimir Putin and while Twitter will
not confirm Russian actors were using

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:19,380
its platform to meddle in the 2016 US
election the proof it happened is adding

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,350
up this Twitter account at tea party
news had a following of more than 22,000

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,019
it blasted the Twitter world with
pro-trump

7
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,549
conservative anti-immigrant stories and
rhetoric throughout the campaign and

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,860
among its followers was the now fired
member of the Trump administration

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:42,090
sebastian Gorka what Gorka and other
followers of tea party news may be

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,379
surprised to learn is the account has
been outed by Russian journalists as

11
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,149
being a part of Russian propaganda
campaigning the account has been linked

12
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,160
to the Internet research agency which a
report by US intelligence officials says

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,079
is a shadowy company tied to the Kremlin
all part of the Russian government's

14
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,159
attempts to meddle in the u.s.
presidential race Twitter accounts

15
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,000
created as part of the Russian
propaganda campaign helped the Russians

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,580
form an entire army of automated Twitter
BOTS and trolls that overwhelmingly

17
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,590
supported one u.s. candidate most of the
accounts are made to look like Trump

18
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,250
supporters but I actually begin and end
in Russia

19
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,770
Samuel Woolley with Oxford University's
internet research group analyzed over 17

20
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,970
million tweets and found networks of
automated accounts that retweet each

21
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,990
other and played a powerful role in
determining the flow of information in

22
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,180
the 2016 election some by foreign
governments attacking the US through

23
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,630
fake news this is literally
manufacturing interest in a tweet yeah

24
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,670
by rapid-fire repeating these retweets
that's right people like to tell me

25
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,640
propaganda has been around forever but
what I say to them is when you

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,229
computationally enhance propaganda you
have a much more difficult time parsing

27
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,640
information and understanding actually
what's going on is weaponize a word that

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,639
you would use
they are absolutely weaponized tea party

29
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,900
news has been shut down by Twitter the
company won't say why but according to

30
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,230
Russian investigate
journalist Andrei Sakharov the end of

31
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,300
tea party news came just as the Russian
media began exposing it they stopped to

32
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,819
operate it exactly after our
investigation the last tweet was on the

33
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:32,700
same day or one day before zakharov tell
CNN the account was one of 50 such

34
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,280
accounts with more than 600,000 Twitter
followers including at least one member

35
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,959
of Donald Trump's administration
contacted by email Sebastien Gorka now

36
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,790
seems to indicate he knew all along tea
party news was a Russian propaganda site

37
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,400
telling CNN he followed the site for the
same reason I follow CNN he wrote to

38
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,420
know what the enemies of truth are doing
time political calls annually says

39
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,489
getting important followers to a Russian
propaganda account was an important part

40
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:07,230
of Putin's disinformation campaign the
hope of the bots and the hope of the

41
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,519
creator of the bot actually more more
pertinently is that someone picks it up

42
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,180
and tweets it out and then lots of other
people make it viral all of those sorts

43
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,049
of things were started as small trends
pushed out by BOTS and then picked up by

44
00:03:19,049 --> 00:00:00,000
the mainstream news media and
politicians
