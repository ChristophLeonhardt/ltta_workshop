>> Sandra: PALESTINIANS
MARCHING ALONG THE BORDER FENCE
FOR A FIFTH ROUND OF WEEKLY
PROTESTS.

RESPOND WITH FORCE.

DAVID LEE MILLER REPORTING LIVE
FROM THE ISRAEL/GAZA BORDER FOR
US.
DAVID LEE?
>> WE'VE SEEN ONE FATALITY
TODAY AS THE HOSTILITIES
CONTINUE TO ESCALATE.
YOU CAN SEE THOUSANDS OF
PALESTINIANS ALONG THE BORDER
JUST SOUTHEAST OF GAZA CITY.
THEY CAME HERE A FEW HOURS AGO
AND SLOWLY THEY'VE MADE THEIR
WAY SOUTH ALONG THE BORDER.
A FEW HUNDRED HAVE ACTUALLY
APPROACHED THE BORDER FENCE.
THE ISRAELIS HAVE WARNED THE
PALESTINIANS THAT IF THEY DO
THAT THERE WOULD BE SERIOUS
CONSEQUENCES.
THEY BEGAN BY FIRING TEAR GAS
AND RUBBER BULLETS.
THE SITUATIONS KA LATEED AND WE
HEARD ROUND AFTER ROUND OF LIVE
AMMUNITION IN THE PAST FEW
HOURS.
THIS NOW AS THE PALESTINIAN
DEMONSTRATORS CONTINUE TO FAN
OUT AND SPREAD OVER A VERY
SIGNIFICANT AREA.
LISTEN, SANDRA, YOU CAN HEAR
THE PALESTINIANS CHEERING IN
THE DISTANCE AND OCCASIONALLY
THE LIVE FIRE OF AMMUNITION AS
WELL AS THE ISRAELIS FIRING
TEAR GAS.
THE PALESTINIANS GOT SO CLOSE
TO THE BORDER FENCE A NUMBER OF
THE PALESTINIANS PLACED A
PALESTINIAN FLAG ON THE FENCE.
TODAY IN ADDITION TO THAT ONE
FATALITY WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF
PEOPLE CRITICALLY INJURED AND
TOLD IN EXCESS OF 160
PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED.
THE TOTAL DEATH TOLL NOW FOR
THIS CONFLICT OVER THE PAST
FIVE WEEKS 42 DEAD, 5,000
PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN INJURED.
WE'RE TOLD THAT 1700 HAVE BEEN
INJURED FROM LIVE FIRE.
THESE DEMONSTRATIONS ARE
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE EACH AND
EVERY WEEK THE PALESTINIANS SAY
UNTIL NEXT MONTH MAY 15th THAT
MARKS THE FOUNDING OF THE
ANNIVERSARY OF ISRAEL.
THE PALESTINIANS CALL IT THE
DAY OF THE GREAT CATASTROPHE.
THE DAY THEY SAY THE ISRAELIS
ILLEGALLY TOOK THEIR LAND.
PALESTINIANS NOW SAYING,
SANDRA, THAT THE DEMONSTRATIONS
WILL LIKELY CONTINUE BEYOND
THAT DATE BUT THAT WAS THE DATE
WE WERE TOLD WHEN THIS BEGAN
FIVE WEEKS AGO THAT THESE
DEMONSTRATIONS WOULD TAKE PLACE
FOR AT LEAST UNTIL THAT TIME.
NOW IT APPEARS THE SITUATION
HERE IS ESCALATING.
WE DO NOT HAVE A TOTAL DEATH
TOLL FOR TODAY BUT WE DO EXPECT
THAT THERE WILL BE AS MANY AS
200 INJURED.
SANDRA, BACK TO YOU.
>> Sandra: INCREDIBLE LIVE SHOT
