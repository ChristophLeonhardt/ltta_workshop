I'm as relieved an it's May 10th and you're watching battlegrounds hello and welcome back to battleground that's what we do every weekday 12 noon Eastern Time it's a one-hour live show i Kim it's a bit show you some video clips or other things I've been following and you can watch or you can tell me what you think on the side panel of the screen as you can see you can write any comment you like but there are too many for me to get to all of them so if you want yours to stand out for a couple bucks you can do what Google calls a super chat comment a couple bucks for five bucks or some people you can ship in a fifty it's all up to you your comment will be in a bright highlighter that I will see out of the corner of my eye and immediately read anyways I want to start with some incredible news it has been an amazing week for Donald Trump literally moments ago Trump tweeted that five very senior Isis commanders have been captured apparently they were lured into a trap by an app on their cell phone that's a 2018 story isn't it and I can't help but think that Donald Trump just captured five senior Islamic terrorists and Barack Obama didn't he release was at 3 or was at 5 Taliban terrorists in exchange for a traitor named Bo Bergdahl who literally walked off his base to go defect to the Taliban just a the latest in stark contrast between Barack Obama President 44 and Donald Trump President 45 that's an amazing day in an amazing week last night or more accurately this very early morning at 2:00 a.m. Eastern Time Donald Trump and the First Lady Melania Trump went to meet a plane of hostages coming back from North Korea and and I'll play you a clip in a moment but I just want to tell you why I think that's so fascinating we've talked about this before I mean most of the time a negotiation happens in a negotiation that is the party sit down and they go back and forth and they compromise or they trade or they make demands but here North Korea has released the remaining American hostages prisoners political prison whatever you want to call them before the meeting even happens when you weren't making concessions just for a meeting you know that it's a strong strong bargaining position for Donald Trump how opposite from the way Barack Obama or frankly George W Bush and Bill Clinton negotiated before him anyways enough talk for me let's watch a clip of Donald Trump and the hostages returning from North Korea how can you not find that moving I don't care if you have trumped arrangement syndrome I don't care for your Democrat how can you not find it beautiful the three captives were redeemed the fact that was at 2:00 a.m. and Donald Trump went to visit them and greet them personally is very symbolic of course and it was quite momentous and they gave it a very dramatic Flair which i think is very appropriate it also harkens back to an ad that Hillary Clinton ran I think it was against Barack Obama so I'm thinking I'm going back to 2009 now she had a campaign I mean remember Hillary Clinton ran for president more than once I don't know if you recall she ran of course against Donald Trump for the presidency but she ran against Barack Obama in 2008 for the nomination and she lost and she had an ad saying who do you want to answer the phone at 3:00 a.m. who's got the kind of gravitas well it was Donald Trump up in Adam at 2:00 a.m. last night wasn't he and it's Hillary Clinton who famously sleeps about 12 to 16 hours a day constant napping and if you doubt me on that will do a show where I show you the access to information documents that show just how nap oriented Hillary Clinton was so much so that her own staff called her a championship mapper so the fact that Donald Trump was there sharp energized ready to rock and roll at 2:00 a.m. for that momentous event just shows you Donald Trump has got the energy it's such as Donald Trump of course he's one man a lot of the success of his administration has been because of his appointees and of course his recent appointment of Mike Pompeo to be Secretary of State and before that CIA director I want to show you the contrast between the reality of president redeeming captives and the fake news media because it is so intense the difference the contrast between the reality of Donald Trump and what his Trump derangement syndrome enemies have to say is so shocking let me show you the New York Times the New York Times put that up on the screen here so this is the New York Times I'm sorry I can't say it without laughing at a key moment Trump's top diplomat is again thousands of miles away and look at that picture with his mouth open there looking a little bit chubby and not exactly of course do you think that picture that picture of Mike Pompeo was chosen randomly or do you think you're all just some goofy guy is some goofy guy and the New York Times the smartest people in America ah that Mike Pompeo he's not even well you know where he was people he flew to North Korea to bring the hostages back he personally went to North Korea to ensure and oversee that they got on the plane he flew there just to bring them back and fly them back that's not a comfortable journey from the United States to North Korea and back I have no I would probably stopped in Hawaii or maybe they stopped in in Guam or something I don't know the route but that's not a direct flight so the New York Times is out right what what is this important moment of this North Korea deal where's Mike Pompeo yeah he's going to rescue hostages but thanks for trying merry times just incredibly I wanted to show you that because literally everything the president does the first response and criticism by the mainstream media you absolutely absolutely cannot take it to the bank you just cannot because it's either a false planted story I mean for example it's hard to believe that stormy Daniels lawyer is still on TV literally every day on CNN in the latest and this was revealed by the daily callers that he said some Russian or some Malaysian payment to Michael Cohen Trump's personal lawyer for million dollars or whatever as Michael Cohen took a secret payment of 4 million here's the bank records yeah you know what um there's a lot of Michael Cohen's out that I went to school with the one I mean there's a lot of Cohen's and Michael's pretty common name a vanetti had the wrong Michael Cohen the Michael Cohen he outed was was a Canadian actually and the daily caller showed just how junk reporting that was but my god they salivated over that story raises the question of course how did a porn stars lawyer I get a hold of someone's confidential banking records - I mean I have no idea about this canadian michael cohen i'm he says he's completely unconnected to Trump or the other Michael Cohen they just have the same name I mean there's probably there's probably 50,000 Cohen's in the world and there's probably a thousand I know hundreds of them named Michael Cole I went to school with a Michael Cohen um you can't just say all the Michael Cohen's are Trump's lawyer I mean that some might even say that's a bit of an ethnic stereotype or something um how do you get the bank records of someone like that if if you happen to be named Michael Cohen and who knows there's somebody Michael Cohen's out there one of them I be watching right now if in the name of scoring a cheap point against Donald Trump someone took your private banking records and published them you will be a bit miffed where's your privacy right how the hell did some porn star lawyer get your banking records now I note in her exchange with Roseanne Barr the other day it came out that stormy Daniels is not paying for her own lawyers of course not so who is well the Democrats are of course all right um I want to remind you what we do here every day at 12:00 noon to 1:00 p.m. Eastern is I it's a lightly produced show I mean we have we showed you that little white house video and we showed you the New York Times website we don't get into the heavy produce shows like I do on my 8:00 p.m. broadcast every night this is just a light way of dealing with some of the other subjects of the day and it's a way to get you involved with the super shine there as you can see on the right hand side of the screen there is a constant stream of questions and comments I'm just gonna pick some randomly deep state at work that's what John Zeeland says well I don't know if it was deep state or police or in some CIA or National Security Administration but banking records are pretty secure I mean banks take security pretty seriously for obvious reasons reasons of reputation also reasons of loyalty their customer and you know they don't want to be HAFTER or defrauded in some way so imagine being able to get the confidential banking records of Michael Cohen so yeah it might actually be some state apparatus that just will not accept Donald Trump as president sputter doggie says four dams the word of prostitutes are their only hope to win the midterms yes people it has come to that I'm not saying that the stormy Daniels vignettes is not newsworthy I think it is modestly newsworthy I don't think it's newsworthy enough to dominate the media day after day week after week are we into month after month now already I think so in the momentous most moments this week of Donald Trump's presidency I mean the Iran deal North Korean hostages capturing five Isis terrorists unemployment below 4 percent I didn't even know that was possible so yeah I think that i think jumped the shark on that one as they say I see a super track comment Mason Nelson thought now did you see what the super chat means so I out of the corner of my eyes see that bright orange there so I'm gonna read it right away now so first of all thanks for chipping in ten bucks do you feel that the Toronto newspapers have any material effect on swaying voters opinions isn't that Aragon does anyone really care what hundred rights Nelson of course the iron grip of dead tree newspapers print newspapers is fading now of course a lot of people get their news online and when you're online you can still reach her on the star articles or New York Times articles online the great equalizer the great great leveling effect is that you and I can be online to you and I would have a tough time publishing a paper expression of our views and having that distributed to in the case of the Toronto Star a million readers a day either in it newspaper boxes or to home delivery whereas on the Internet where we all sort of look equal don't we I mean I can put something on Twitter I can put something on YouTube anyone can you can record yourself on your phone and upload in a minute so first of all there's a great great equalizer there's a lot more voices in there a lot more fact checking and a lot more counter points before that's why a lot of these mainstream newspapers have abolished the comment sections yes the influence the mainstream media is fading but a lot of people who are not as plugged into the news as you and I still rely on the mainstream media for the talking points the very fact that you know hon Drake a name of an executive the Toronto Star tells me you're probably in the most informed and alert 1% severely normal Torontonians would not know who hon Drake is or any names of executives in the media that's just not what normal people care about and I should say this great liberal liberation of the minds of the public has come about because of social media and in reaction social media has tried to plug the holes by cracking down on conservative points of view it was social media for sure we gave Donald Trump the 2016 presidential election and before that the brexit vote which is precisely why Facebook YouTube Google Amazon all these companies are cracking down on dissident voices um I gotta read some more comments here let's see case CC 2 says Ontario is already becoming New Delhi well let me say one thing about New Delhi I have not been there my mace himself but I do know it is the capital city of the world's largest democracy frankly I'm more worried about people who come to Canada who bring a liberal undemocratic points of view including Sharia law john Zeeland says NDP candidate caught on audio said he would cut teachers pay by 15% they shot I'll take a listen to that I haven't seen that yet you're the first person to bring it to my attention I wonder if that will get any where close to the attention that Tim Hudak's pledged to retire 100,000 public servants God D mahaki says nd P equals socialism do you want Ontario to become Venezuela well I'm as you know Ontario has been a have-not province for about a decade about a decade which means it literally receives welfare in the form of Equalization payments from have provinces when you D industrialize on purpose when you shut down what a North America's best and cleanest coal-fired power plants just to make a political point when you hundreds of hideous expensive on environmental wind turbines you think you can make a wind turbine without burning coal you cannot make steel without burning coal do you think those visual blights actually pay for themselves either economically or in terms of an energy balance of course not so you dean dust realized real industry you subsidized through crony capitalism the fake industry of that's a wind turbines and you have yourself a kind of Venezuela soft Venezuela but Venezuela itself was more characterized not just by socialism but authoritarianism and and national nationalization of assets and I think you're starting to see a little bit of that in Alberta where Rachel Notley is now talking about nationalizing the pipeline project and then rerun into more comments and then I'm going to move on we have some more news stories of the day including from our friends project Veritas just some amazing work they've been doing zero ass turn that Ritter says terrorism is part and parcel of living in a city quoting Sadek Khan the mayor of New York that is Mayor of London excuse me London England that is exactly what he said and he he said that sort of like a shrug oh well you know that's the price of London being a great city London has been a great city for centuries and it has never before accepted brutal attacks on civilians it's just part and parcel that was his words being in a big city in fact when when attacks on civilians were the norm in the Battle of Britain and the Blitz Churchill marshaled the country towards war he didn't say oh yeah well that's part and parcel of living with Nazis you know they're gonna do that what are you gonna do I think a lot of people don't know where if they knew they've forgotten that saticon before he became mayor he was an activist lawyer including for families of terrorists not terrorist victims but terrorists so of course he's sympathetic or at least gentle on them one more comment and then I'll go to our next news story the name Grampy Z says soon Alberta will be a have-not four ovens yeah I mean it's of course all relative I mean other provinces are being devastated quickly so Alberta started so much higher it needs to be brought low for a long time to be a have enough province but yeah I mean Trudeau Gerald buds Catherine McKenna Rachel Notley Jim John Horgan they all agree Alberta's oil patch needs to be retired sooner or later or as Rachel notley's former chief policy advisor on the oil sands said leave it in the ground so yeah that would definitely turn up or they and they have dog province check the clock it's 1217 we're about one-third done if you want your comments who stand out for sure feel free to click in and with a super chat comment that basically just means it stands out cost you a couple bucks or we had a fellow who just chipped in ten about of course just goes straight to our cost here at the rebel we are not sponsored by the government in any way we don't get 1.5 billion dollars a year like the CBC does so I read dollar helps um I want to move on to a great video out of the United States from our friends at project Veritas we're talking about fake news media real news media in Canada it's just awful in America CNN in The New York Times to become parodies of themselves and and I think it's fair to say that a lot of the mainstream media in the States are just playthings of billionaires I mean they're not profitable they're just a way for some rich kid to have a seat at the table in politics of course it's Jeff Bezos the by most measures the richest man in the world if you're excluding tyrants the king of Saudi Arabia Egypt as those the most wealthy person in the world homeland owner of and controller of Amazon worth about a hundred billion dollars he bought the Washington Post is just just having a chip in the game of course bezels as you know has a six hundred million dollar data services contract with the CIA so he has a real stake in things he owns the Washington Post that's why Donald Trump calls it the Amazon Washington Post or the bezels of Washington Post New York Times also owned by a billionaire the richest man in the world Carlos Slim is his name he is a Mexican oligarch so it's sort of funny than the New York Times which claims to be an American Journal of record is actually controlled by a foreigner who has raged against Donald Trump the best on the two-man actually had a meeting once where they seemed to patch things up a bit but the New York Times continues its secular jihad against Trump I the one thing that I always remember how we say the conservative politicians whether it's Doug Ford in Ontario or Jason Kenney in Alberta I always say however much politicians are despised never forget the journalists are much more despised in every poll I've ever seen especially in the United States in the last few years people hate the media not just disagree with him hate them distrust them that's why it Trump and his I mean a nickname only works if it sticks and it only sticks if it rings true right Low Energy Jeb Bush people said yeah he is sort of low-energy you know little rocket man yeah it wasn't his best work when when Donald Trump says fake news that sticks because we all know it's true yet CNN and other mainstream journalists are the ones getting all the kudos at all don't say the White House Correspondents Dinner whereas James O'Keefe the founder of project Veritas has probably broken more stories of significant import than any other American journalist he came to fame when he took on acorn and exposed how they would help he posed as a pimp with a prostitute and exposing you know there's countless stories they've done but without further ado let me show you a video with the New Jersey teachers association teachers unions are both the biggest leftist activists in America they're extremely well-funded and they're extremely radical sort of like they are in Canada to check out this video of Veritas undercover video about how the teachers unions cover up sex abuse done by their members in schools tickling this Lake City area schools document from the office of the superintendent Kimberly blasek corroborates the statements Johnny Mickle's made to our journalists about what happened in the young girl's bedroom quote it is alleged that the teacher engaged in a course of inappropriate conduct with one of the district's female students Jane Doe who was aged 7 or 8 at the time entered the students bedroom during the night while on the bedroom the teacher uncovered the student and lifted her nightgown grabbed the student's underwear and attempted to pull the underwear down it is alleged that these incidents are similar incidents involving inappropriate touching happened at least five and ten times the relevant documents we uncovered in this investigation are available on our website Project Veritas calm despite the damning evidence against the teacher project Veritas has decided not to name or show him because no criminal charges were ever pressed the man in question is no longer a teacher and his left Michigan to middle schools I'll tell you what's a male cyano teacher that better you than me cuz man you gotta be here look here that guy he's so excited about teaching sex ed to middle school students what's middle school is another way of saying I know grade 7 to 9 or 7 to 10 I guess it depends on the jurisdiction so I thought this was in New Jersey there was Michigan so five or ten times he's just groping groping groping and the end of that story is that he got paid fifty thousand dollars to sort of quietly leave and he still has his teaching certificate he didn't have to pay fifty thousand dollars in a fine he is not banned from teaching he's boasting about what he did he's still boasting about it five or ten tie he's thrilled to chief sex ed I remind you that in the province of Ontario the new sex ed curriculum was drafted under the auspices of the Deputy Minister Dan Levin who was later convicted of child pornography and tried to arrange meetings with young children um I want to take a short break and run an ad for a conference that we're doing here at the rebel on June 2nd take a look at this we're gonna discuss topics that the political elites in the media party don't want us to discuss political correctness be damned past is enough of a principle died the world by perhaps we are in better touch with the pulse of the country we are in this fight with you and you're all in this fight together it is the over the last few years has been this populist movement going around the world that's the status of the left at this point is I don't know if you're the onion or the New York Times most modernism is a sophisticated philosophy now the draw but it's deeply wrong we're simply people with another point of view there's still some tickets available that's June 2nd here in Toronto if you're in Ontario or want to make the trip I highly recommend it with a great time last year and it just felt like a reunion it was fun the speeches were short and breezy I don't think anyone spoke for more than 20 minutes professor Jordan Petersen was there he spoke for 20 minutes I don't think he is constitutionally capable of speaking for less than that but did you see that coming that was a clip from last year it's amazing where some of those folks have gone on I mean Jordan Peters understand the number one best-selling author in the English language and Doug Ford well he's just weeks away from being the next premier if the polls are any indication I just remind her what we're doing because it's 1225 we're half done today I like to every noon hour just have a kibbutz with you live I just sit down I have some notes in front of me some video clips or whatnot but it's not a highly produced show I try and take some comments for example rhaegar targaryen I'm guessing that's not your real name says dude I just saw Jordan Peterson on the clip I almost spontaneously teared out loud at work isn't that the truth I mean there's a guy who was been fighting the fight and a building building building building building up for about a year and a half now and so many times he could have said this is too much hassle I'm tired I'm not going to do it and the reason he might have considered doing that is because he was under threat I mean right now he seems large and powerful and wealthy and independent but don't forget a year and a half ago there was a professor at the University of Toronto being threatened by the deans and the threats were not fake you might recall that he used to get a grant from the social sciences and Humanities Research Council which is a Canadian government grant for professors for 20 years she's been getting that grant and after he starts saying the wrong politics the grant was cut off even though as a professor he has an outstanding record so he was being punished he was being marginalized he was being threatened and he didn't bend the knee he did not bend the knee and he could have and it would have just it would have been snuffed out like a little puff like you know when a candle goes out there's a little bit of smoke but then you forget about it instead he chose to burn and so many other candles have been lit so many people to be inspired I say again more people have been inspired by Jordan Peterson in the last year than anyone else I can detect in the popular culture and if I'll keep an eye on in the comments section here you tell me if there's someone else you can name that's why the other day when someone said Jordan Peterson run for office no no no no no never keep him changing hearts and minds that's where he does his good work all right it's 1227 I want to read some I shall wanna I want to tell you a story about censorship because that's a big theme of Jordan Peterson he believes in debate he believes in thinking and discussion and back and forth and open-mindedness in a way that the left preaches but doesn't actually mean I wanted to tell you some news out of the United Kingdom and when I first saw the headline I said no I can't be real that can't be real but it's real let me show you this story is from the Daily Mail sharing hate posts online could lead to six months jail as judges recommend harsh punishments for internet trolls who torment racial religious or sexual minority groups and I just saw that headline and I said I'll write the Daily Mail it's a great tabloid it's a very lively paper I really enjoy it it's fun you can see on that just look for a second hold that image up did you see on the side of the Daily Mail they're just so good with the clickbait they have so many little celebrity types a baby they're great with the photos so you see this story and you're you may look it's the Daily Mail they really take things and they and they run with it because and I thought this has got to be an exaggeration maybe they have a fact wrong here because six months in jail for not just making a tweet or a Facebook post but potentially if you like or retweet or share something that someone else's made so it's not just someone who authors mean tweets it's that you dare to like it or forward it to your friends or pass it on even if you pass it on for criticism or but it's true let me read a little bit that this comes it's not law yet but it is a proposal by British judges who are in what they call the Sentencing Council as you know in every legal system especially in the UK which is very similar to Canada there are sentencing guidelines right so that there's some standard in the law some precedent so people know what to expect that's part of the law being public you know what penalties and punishments are you know how to govern yourself what can you expect the punishment be to be if you retweet something the normal human answer is none I'm a free person expressing my point of view well you don't understand the United Kingdom do you the it's just a proposal right now according to the Daily Mail the recommendations will be subject to a three-month consultation I'm going to tell you how that consultations gonna end right now is just I don't know if you're in suspense they're going to accept this and if you doubt me well remember that video we played I think we played it on Monday it was of count danger law which is the online nickname of some Scottish youtuber with the big huge earrings and lip plug you just got a lot of metal going on like he was a real counterculture guy he was the the kooky guy who trained his wife's dog to put its paw up when he said Heil Hitler it was a really weird joke he was trying to make this cute little dog do the ugliest thing he could think of I mean it's it was a practical joke that he spent way too much time and effort on and it's a little bit mean it's creepy but it's you've got to see the humor there it is possible to make a joke about Hitler by the way there I mean I think it is probably possible to make a joke about every single subject and he made a joy as a practical joke and he was nonetheless prosecuted criminally and convicted and he could have been sentenced but the judge merely find him eight hundred pounds now he says he will not pay that fine and intends to appeal but I tell you the case of Count Dracula which we've discussed before just to say that it is an absolute certainty that these sentencing guidelines will go through and the United Kingdom which is currently under a massive crime wave I mean I was reading a stat that every 90 minutes in London there is a stabbing attack sometimes with great machetes and you know the gun crimes it's it's almost I mean it's not quite Chicago style over there yet but the UK has been officially gun free for decades well the criminals didn't get the memo that will acid attacks to their make it really making yeah that's the thing you take away the guns I move to the knives it's it's too funny but it's sad UK people that follow about 10 different UK police Twitter accounts just out of curiosity Bedford sure Cambridgeshire Met Police in the UK of different accounts I follow them on social media because they're so ridiculous it's I mean I followed accounts of some yeah if you like me you follow a range of accounts on Twitter you follow some a lot of comedy just for you know a little bit of levity you follow people across the political spectrum you you want to know what the enemy says right so you I mean it's always good to hear the other side once in a while they get it right I follow British police because they are so absurd because they regularly tweet threats to people who have wronged think and the latest stick out of the UK police and I say again I fought them on Twitter I'm not making this up right I'm not taking it secondhand even from the Daily Mail I follow a half a dozen UK police forces on Twitter because they will post a picture of a gardening tool that they have seized as part of their crackdown on crime and they're so absurd I mean remember that case of the guy who put bacon outside a mosque that's not a very friendly thing to do because of course Muslims don't eat pork I'm trying to think if someone were to leave a big ham outside a synagogue is Jews on proceed for United say it's pretty weird and stupid and if he vandalized something I might be but he was sentenced to prison baking for bacon for bacon crime what he sent a guy in a prison for putting bacon at a mosque he's gonna wind up dead because the mosque sorry the the prisons in the UK are run by Muslim gangs I mean in the states that run by various gangs in the UK they're Muslim gangs is that me Tommy Robinson himself told me what it was like when he was in prison various times they are halal prisons they're run in strict accordance with Holloway of halal food they have prayers they have quran's the prison guards are told to respect Islam Tommy was in solitary confinement in prison because if he were not he would have been murdered as indeed that bacon criminal was so yes of course yes of course the amount of effort being put because because it's easier to arrest someone for a Twitter tweet than to arrest someone who caused that Twitter tweet because they were part of a rape gang or terrorism if you have millions of Muslim migrants a not insignificant proportion of whom morally supports Sharia law and tens of thousands of whom literally support violence I mean 23,000 jihadis are being monitored in the UK you cannot monitor 23,000 people when you have that many people who are actually a violent threat and when you have hundreds of thousands or even millions who morally support Sharia law that's too big a problem for police to solve so it's much easier to crack down on what someone says on Twitter or Facebook and you arrest someone for tweeting something you arrest a Scottish youtuber for making a Count de aquila video he's not gonna blow himself up he's not gonna go to the mosque and get a bunch of guys and have a big you know he's second do anything violent easier to go after a count dank EULA or some granny on Twitter than 23-thousand jihadis at their monitoring let's take a quick look it's 12 35 I'm gonna read some comments end of the line Joel said Ezra what do you think about Western countries should they adopt a robust constitutions like the USA in order to protect free speech in the release well of course they should I think the First Amendment's which is a free speech and religion and the Second Amendment which is for firearms and the right to self-defense and are not only I mean obviously than the first two amendments in the Bill of Rights not only are they the most important and obviously deemed such by the founding fathers of the United States but they are what sets America apart from the countries of the world and make it such a free country and make it so impervious to authoritarianism if the United Kingdom or if we here in Canada had the First Amendment so many of these politically correct nuisances would just be moral nurses they wouldn't be legal nuisances and second of all people would not be so timid about their liberties being taken away when you have an armed populace the government is always slightly uneasy I would rather have a government that's slightly uneasy with its people rather than a people that's uneasy with its government so yeah mmm John Jilin said nice to see Joe Warmington is attending rebel live any news on Joe becoming a rebel he was great with the Zoid last night Joe Warmington I think it's one of the best shoe leather reporters in Toronto he's outstanding he covers stories with heart and he gets out from behind his desk he's out with the people where the news is he's patients he's got a nose for news he's my favorite guy he happens to work for the Toronto Sun and I'm sure he's happy where he is because he does great work and I'm sure they pay him for freely I'm just guessing here but of course we love him and we would love as much Joe warming to us we can get WP says do you think Trump should revoke press credentials given that he doesn't need them anymore well of course under the First Amendment you don't need any credential to be with the press you can just say I'm the press First Amendment that's your press credentials same thing here in Canada you don't need a license to have a press credential in the former Soviet bloc you did I think it was Romania or maybe Bulgaria you literally needed a government license to own a typewriter did you know that it's got a license because they want to keep track of who had those evil machines to this say of course Cuba censors the internet so Reporters Without Borders says it's the most repressive regime in the Western Hemisphere of course it is but perhaps you're referring to the White House press briefing room they traditionally grant some those pretty easily we briefly had one I'd like to get a press credential again for our team we have a reporter in Washington halftime as you may know Rob Jim shock he does campus unmasked for us my point is I suppose Donald Trump can say who he allows or doesn't allow in that press briefing room at the Oval Office or the White House rather or on Air Force One or whatever but Donald Trump cannot actually revoke any media credentials per se because you don't need a credential to be with the media you just have to do journalism um trust no one says I could write rise up funds to go to the states and ask about Canada in the US okay D mitt how like he says yes it was Romanian thank you for confirming that I was going from memory but I remember reading that as a teenager and I was just shocked by it trust no one says in Canada we still have time to think right well sort of but look at their attempted censorship of Jordan Peterson they're continuing censorship of Lindsay Shepard from Laurie hey by the way she's coming to the Ribble live as well Zoli Z says what the government wants is a civil war and the crazy thing is if there isn't one and the very police and government will have to fight this in Sargeant's I don't quite understand what you're talking about so I'll skip that one end of the line Joel says well David Menzies be appearing at the live event well not just appearing he'll be our emcee as he was last year El Chupacabra says love Rob shim shock great content he puts out yeah you know what I mentioned rob a moment ago he's based in Washington he does about half time he works for the Daily Caller and the other half he works for us and he does a specialty website tracking anti Western anti-democratic anti-israel crazy hate on campuses it's especially website we have called campus unmasked calm campus unmasked Kampf I recommend it every single day he does a video in a story and he covers universities there you go look at that means their profits largest police union fascist that's an example of the kind of stories he does prof ordered to apologize for elevator lingerie joke Muslim student hopes Hamas tortures Israeli soldier slowly have you ever been in this web site it looks pretty cool do you think Anti Fog group suggests burning police feminist scholar ties pelicans to racial high sex right yeah I don't understand that either a professor threatened student over man yo you get the point every single day there's a story there just on the crazy crazy crazy nosaka passes in Canada United States I think it's great website and the line joe says good website Thank You Island Ariel says what happened to Gorka he was doing daily videos for us but he's gotten so busy so he's doing them less frequently but he was I know we did someone Syria I'll have to check him because he's just I've never seen anyone busier than him i he's just always going to conferences and stuff like that i know that he he said he was unable to keep up the pace and he originally he was doing daily videos that's that's so much that's and they were really intensive videos if you remember so hopefully he'll stay in our orbit and do them more occasionally and we regard him as a friend and an ally he's just it we I think he was a little bit unrealistic to expect him to do a video every single day especially with the comprehensiveness that he does he was like a it was like a professor's lecture every day it actually takes so even though his videos were let's say five or ten minutes I'm sure they took him hours to do one more comment justin trudeau cringe channel says oh yeah the media went out of there to say he wasn't Muslim and call him a white man I think you're talking about Alec Minassian the truck of an attacker suspect in Toronto we've been talking about my friend Joe Warmington and I'm gonna talk about his new story in a minute but first we have one more add about our first documentary take a look Dylan Dylan I imagine selahattin saw developer scubadelphia button and i'll be done on the planning Canada I knew golliwog - Aslam moon shone on Islam which involve our document hey welcome back I was just looking at some comments there while we were showing you the ad for our Iraq documentary there's one I want to answer from Zoli Z who said Ezra did you hear about anything about the Russian companies who were indicted on the whole Mueller madness now entering police yes I did you might recall that in a dramatic flourish to prove that there was collusion with Russia and by the way you know the word collusion means it means to work together on something it sounds nefarious like conspiracy but it's conspiracy to do what conspiracy to commit a crime right I mean that's that's what the conspiracy is people getting together to do something bad simply conspiring together or working together or doing something together is not a crime in itself unless what you're conspiring to do is a crime right and so the phrase collusion I challenge you to find it in any law it's not a crime um so it was a political hunt and Mila needed to show something and so he indicted a dozen Russians who he said were internet trolls and I'm not quite sure what the crime of that is to have propaganda on Facebook because everyone is propaganda on Facebook and the Democrats and the Republicans have propaganda on Facebook and some would say the rebel is propaganda and the rebel would say the CBC is propaganda and you could use the for word Frank news I think fake news is in the eye of the beholder I by the way don't dispute that Russia engages in disinformation and propaganda online I recall in 2014 the head of NATO Anders Fogh Rasmussen saying he had evidence that Russia was supporting Western environmental groups to whip them up against fracking because of course if if Europe started to frack its own natural gas they wouldn't be buying natural gas from Russia's Gazprom so we know for a fact we know for a fact during the Margaret Thatcher years the coal miners strike the coal miners union was sponsored by the KGB because it was a great industrial sabotage to the West yes yes yes yes we know that Russia engages in subterfuge and propaganda and disinformation in the West and I certainly hope that America does the same around the world of course I know we do sometimes it's out in the open like The Voice of America broadcasts or like Russia's RT Russia today is propaganda but a lot of it's darker my point is I'm not quite sure what the crime was supposed to be of Russian internet trolls posting disinformation to Facebook but Mueller needed a scalp Muller is how they say it I'd look at it says Mueller to me a Muller needed some scalps so he indicted I think was 13 Russians thinking well they'll never come to face these charges there in Russia we have no ability to enforce them to summon them but it'll make for a good show well surprise surprise at least one of the Russians that Muller says I'm gonna prosecute you for collusion for your Twitter Facebook e stuff I said all right we'll come to American defend ourselves and wouldn't you know it Muller has gone to court saying but but but you know I'm judge can we delay this we actually do want to go in to know and the judge said no no you will proceed and it's soaked I mean when does a prosecutor ever say no we'd rather that foreign suspect not present at trial I mean there there is a concept of a trial in absentia if a bad guy refuses to show up the court does here some facts ex parte as they say but when have you ever heard in history of a prosecutor laying charges against someone very very far away and when that person says all right I will come to your jurisdiction and submit to your court and I will meet the case against me isn't that when prosecutors say whoa that's amazing the alleged criminal is coming to court we had no chance of arresting him and bringing him here there's no way we could send the FBI just to pick him up from Moscow oh my god he's coming so yes that's extremely interesting and a prosecutor should normally be thrilled that rushon polluter is coming to town but in the case of Muller you say no your honor um yeah we don't actually want to proceed I think that says everything it says that this is not a real legal battle it's not a real prosecution it is a PR exercise isn't that clear hey let me check the clock oh my god is 12 48 I've been talking so much we haven't even got to run that story I want to talk about it we were talking earlier about my friend Joe Warmington well he's got a great story in the Toronto Sun let's put it up on the screen for a bed Warmington and cops warned to watch for violent ms-13 gang members look at that tattoo that is done to terrify of course but it's also done to mark the man who wears it when you have that on your face you can never leave the gang ms-13 sense from Mara Salvatrucha I got a look what up what that means I'm probably pronouncing it wrong but that is a gang Salva in El Salvador it's just just overrun the country in a way that the Mafia never managed to overrun Italy by the way so devastated in El Salvador and has moved into the United States across their poorest border I mean look at that guy you put that back up there that's such a shocking shocking picture that is ms-13 if you see a guy like that if you're not absolutely terrified then you don't have a good internal compass and that's the point of it but it's also to trap that guy that guy cannot have second thoughts can II you know i mean i mentioned the Mafia it's like what was that The Godfather Part three so I want to get out but they pulled me back in yeah we do you got a face tattoo like that you can't leave you're in it for life or until death so that was a problem it was a big problem in the final years of the Obama regime and Donald Trump has talked about ms-13 a lot and the crimes committed by these gangs and he's really cracked down on them but guess what guess what when you open the border from Canada to the United States when you put out a tweet welcoming American illegals to as Justin Trudeau has done don't be surprised if guys who look like this say yeah I'd rather try my chances with that softy Justin Trudeau then with Donald Trump the guy who's just made North Korea blank the guy who says he's gonna build a wall I hope he does um let me read a couple lines from this Joe warming story I don't know if we have this for the screen but Joe just read it from the story in my hand the federal government has warned Canadian police services that violent gangs known for cutting off the heads of victims are attempting to sneak across u.s. Canada border points to avoid president donald trump's changing immigration policy the Toronto Sun has learned let me just read two more lines the classified alerts from criminal intelligence services Canada warns quote violence linked to the ms-13 is often described as brutal from senseless beatings to dismemberment just one more sentence Toronto has seen this gang before even arresting members who threatened a Toronto justice official ms-13 stands from Mara Salvatrucha which CISC calls a Latin American Street gang known for its violent activities that exploits migration patterns to set up new cells it's it calls ms-13 one of the largest and most violent organized crime groups in the world with 70,000 members in half a dozen countries so yeah ms-13 that's not a term I ever thought we would have to learn in Canada I barely heard about them in the States I don't think I even heard the phrase ms-13 until the last year now they're coming to Canada and that is not your Warmington x' opinion and it's not the opinion of the Toronto Sun that is a warning and alert to Canadian peaceful police forces from the criminal Intelligence Service Canada basically the the clearing house for Intel about crimes and why not if 50,000 people can simply walk across from the United States and Canada why would you not do that if you're part of an international organized crime syndicate that is colonizing different regimes and Donald Trump is finally cracking down well now you've got this fool Justin Trudeau who could not be more open I mean listen if he'll pay 10.5 million dollars for terrorists like Omar Khadr if that's the kind of friendliness he show is of course he's gonna roll out the welcome mat to ms-13 and I'm not saying that justin trudeau positively once I miss 13 to come to Canada I'm just thinking he says that's a small side effect that someone else will have to pay Justin Trudeau himself of course has an armed security detail as we would want any Canadian Prime Minister to have but you and I aren't allowed to protect ourselves and he won't guard the border it is 12:53 we have only about seven minutes left if you want to make a comment go ahead and type it I'll read it if you want yours to stand out feel free to chip in a few bucks it makes your comment in bright colors I see it and of course it helps us pay our bills True Grit says the UK was supposed to be America's Ally the UK is under the Chinese banking system alongside Russia and not the Western banking system of the u.s. World War three is a false flag to remove Westerners I'm gonna have to challenge you on that my friend I think the London is in fact one of the financial capitals of the world and although it does do a lot of business especially with Russia and of course the Middle East it is very much tied into the American system of banking so I'm going to politely disagree with you on that gray mpz says I hope Sheila does a juicy story about the left bridge Denny's story yeah I've watched that video and obviously we don't like people screaming at each other drunk in a restaurant and she said you're not real Canadians and apparently those Muslim migrants had in fact become Canadian citizens is it fair to call that a racist tirade from her I think it's probably fair it certainly was uncomfortable to watch she used the f-word on them they used the f-word on her what I want to know is what happened right before that camera went on because when one of the parties videotapes a conflict and doesn't show the whole thing it just makes me curious about what happened beforehand did they say something about her did they say I don't know so I think there's actually less to this story than meets the eye or more as in I want to know what else happened I don't think that woman was polite I think there was definitely a racial undertone to it I didn't hear any actual racial epithets and then she said you're not Canadian I understand they were speaking a foreign language Arabic beforehand I just don't know obviously not a pleasant exchange both parties were asked to leave the restaurant which suggests that both were at least in the eyes of the manager engaged in bad behavior I just don't know and we won't know because we don't know what was said or done before the five minutes of that Facebook video I see my own friend Sheila Gunn has chipped in five bucks Sheila we pay you you don't have to pay us for a super chat but I'll read it nonetheless Sheila says block boss please say el chupacabra again brutal epic habla again I have my family gathered computer to hear it and enjoy I haven't yet looked up El Chupacabra to find out what it means but um it reminds me of the Jack Black movie where he plays a wrestler with a mask with el macho Grande and it's just fun to talk that way a long time ago before most of you Millennials were even born there was a movie starring Richard Dreyfuss where give me one second movie but he was I think it was something moon over Parador I think it was called and he was an actor who looked very much like a petty dictator in this banana republic called Parador and so the dictator died so they pressed Richard Dreyfuss this actor into services sort of a double the body devil to be the president so there wasn't a civil war and he loved saying things so you got to see it you know it's it's sort of like a b-movie but it's fun and he just really got into being Latin I mean even though he wasn't said Parador I want to swim in your eavers I want to climb your and the way he said that it was I think it was one of Richard Dreyfuss is funniest roles it was the movie was pretty weak but when he said panatar I didn't offer you I want to swim in your Reavers it was it was compelling all right let's check the clock so 57 we don't have a lot more time not show Libre that's right well Sheila I appreciate I appreciate you joining outside we get you're doing these chit chats trust no one says in Montreal there's propaganda over China even they saw the propaganda to say Trump with then don't know exactly what you mean but it is absolutely true that China has a very powerful force in Canada now Chinese people can be outstanding patriotic and loyal Canadians industrious hard-working brilliance productive great Canadians absolutely of course of course but it is also true that the Chinese government itself has a malign presence in Canada and we see this in various ways one of the ways in fact is for the Chinese government in Canada to persecute Chinese Democrat democracy activists here in China my old friend Joe Wong who is with NDT TV his brother is still back in China and Joe here in Canada's a democracy activist I remember he told me he got a phone call from his brother in China his brother said I'm with the secret police and the police were there and they said if you don't stop your democracy activism in Canada I will be harmed in China could you imagine the psychological and emotional blackmail that the Chinese secret police were playing on them I know the Falun Gong in Canada are regularly bullied by Chinese diplomats even Chinese media Xinhua the state broadcaster of China they go to press conferences in Canada with Chinese dissidents and abuse and berate them in Canada and that's just the public stuff of course there's massive espionage industrial espionage probably ten years ago now CSIS said there were 1,000 Chinese agents in Canada 1,000 so I agree with you that's why I'm different on than Justin Trudeau he says his favorite government in the world is China because of their basic dictatorship I admire the Chinese people obviously looking at me you know I've been to more than my share of Chinese restaurants I find many things interesting with China I visited it in Spence fare by the time there the one thing I hate about China is the communist dictatorship which is actually the only one thing that Justin Trudeau he says he likes about that country yeah I think they're definitely a rival and watching Donald Trump negotiate with them as a rival is very interesting he's playing a very interesting game but so far it seems to be working I see by the clock on the wall but it's 1259 time goes quickly I'll be back tomorrow we do this every day from 12:00 noon till 1:00 p.m. Eastern
