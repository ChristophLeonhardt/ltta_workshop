TONIGHT, ERIC HOLDER'S EARLY PUSH TELLS US ANYTHING ABOUT WHICH DIRECTION THE DEMOCRATS ARE HEADED. THE FIRST IN THE NATION'S PRIMARY STATE GOT A VISIT FROM A OBAMA A LUM. THERE IS ASSUMPTIONS. ERIC HOLDER TOLD BUSINESS LEADER AND ACTIVITY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TODAY THAT HIS ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT 2020 WILL COME IN THE EARLY PART OF 2019. WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE PRESIDENCY IS THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT I AM CONSIDERING. HOLDER WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN ATTORNEY GENERAL AND ALSO THE FIRST ATTORNEY GENERAL TO BE HELD IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS WHEN HE DIDN'T COOPERATE WITH THE FAST AND FURIOUS. AND HE WOULD BE A FIRST- TIME CANDIDATE. I NEVER RUN FOR ELECTED OFFICE. THE RECENTLY RELEASED COMEY MEMOS CRITICIZED HOLDER AND OBAMA BECOMING TOO FRIENDLY WITH EACH. AND PRESIDENT TRUMP REGRETTED HIRING THE CURRENT ATTORNEY GENERAL. HOLDER PROTECTED THE PRESIDENT AND I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THAT. THAT APPEARANCE OF CLOSENESS WILL BE CRITICAL. HE'S NOT A HOUSEHOLD NAME TO DEMOCRATIC VOTERS AND THAT IS A BIG CHALLENGE. BUT HE WILL TRY TO RIDE THE OBAMA WAVE. THERE IS IT A LOT OF NOSTA LJA FOR OBAMA. TWO GUYS FROM QUEENS, THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING. YOU KNOW, NEW YORKERS, THEY KNOW HOW TO TALK TO OTHER NEW YORKERS. NDEMOCRATIC PRIMARY VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY WENT FROM BERNIE
