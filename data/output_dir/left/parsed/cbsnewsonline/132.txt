STRONG LEGAL AND CONSERVATIVE 
BACKGROUNDS. 
THE PRESIDENT'S PICK IS 
EXPECTED TO FACE A CHALLENGING 
CONFIRMATION PROCESS IN THE 
SENATE. 
REPUBLICANS CURRENTLY HOLD 51 
SEATS IN THE SENATE. 
THEY'LL NEED ALL OF THOSE VOTES 
TO CONFIRM THE NOMINEE. 
GOP LEADERS ARE HOPING SOME 
DEMOCRATS WILL HELP THEM CLEAR 
THE 51 VOTE HURDLE. 
TO DO THAT THEY'RE FOCUSING ON 
DEMOCRATS FROM RED STATES LIKE 
SENATOR JOE MANCHIN OF WEST 
VIRGINIA, SENATOR HEIDI 
HEITKAMP OF NORTH DAKOTA AND 
SENATOR JOE DONNELLY OF 
INDIANA, BUT THERE IS A CONCERN 
THAT SOME REPUBLICANS COULD 
BREAK FROM THE PARTY. 
SENATORS SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE 
AND LISA MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA 
HAVE BOTH SAID THEIR VOTES WILL 
DEPEND ON THE NOMINEE'S STANCE 
ON WHETHER TO OVERTURN ROE 
VERSUS WADE. 
BACK WITH ME NOW ARE CBS NEWS 
CONTRIBUTOR AND REPUBLICAN 
STRATEGIST LESLIE SANCHEZ, CBSN 
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR AND 
POLITICAL REPORTER FOR THE 
GUARDIAN, SABRINA SIDDIQUI AND 
CBSN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR AND 
NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER FOR 
REAL CLEAR POLITICS CAITLYN 
HUEY BURNS AND JOINING US FROM 
WASHINGTON IS DEMOCRATIC 
STRATEGIST JOEL PAYNE. 
WELCOME TO YOU ALL. 
CAITLYN, LET ME START WITH YOU. 
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE FRONT 
RUNNERS AND THE PRESIDENT'S 
DECISION MAKING PROCESS UP TO 
THIS POINT? 
>> WELL, WE KNOW FROM VARIOUS 
REPORTS THAT THE PRESIDENT 
DIDN'T MAKE UP HIS MIND UNTIL 
TODAY. 
YESTERDAY HE WAS TALKING ABOUT 
THAT HE HAD IT NARROWED DOWN TO 
ABOUT FOUR CANDIDATES, ALL OF 
WHOM HE SAID WOULD BE GREAT AND 
EASILY CONFIRMABLE. 
HE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN PLAYING 
THIS OUT AS A REALITY SHOWESQUE 
KIND OF ORDEAL AND REALLY KIND 
OF ENJOYING THIS WHOLE PROCESS. 
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT 
FOR HIM. 
HE HAS SAID AS MUCH. 
HE SAYS THIS IS THE MOST 
IMPORTANT THING A PRESIDENT CAN 
DO ASIDE FROM WAR AND SOME 
OTHER ISSUES. 
SO HE IS TAKING THIS 
OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY MAKE A 
THING OF IT AND HE ULTIMATELY 
HOPES THAT THIS IS SOMETHING 
THAT WILL BE REALLY CRITICAL IT 
HIS OWN LEGACY GIVEN THE AGES 
OF MANY OF THESE FOLKS YOU SEE 
ON THE SCREEN. 
THIS PERSON WILL LIKELY SERVE 
IN THIS POSITION FOR A 
GENERATION. 
SO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING A 
LO OF ACTIVISM ON ALL SIDES OF 
THIS -- LOT OF ACTIVISM ON ALL 
SIDES OF THIS ISSUE AND A LOT 
OF LOBBYING AND JOCKEYING. 
WE'LL KNOW IN ABOUT A HALF HOUR 
OR SO. 
>> SABRINA, REMIND US WHO SOME 
OF THE VOICES THAT HAVE 
INFLUENCED THE PRESIDENT WHEN 
IT COMES TO THIS PROCESS HAVE 
BEEN? 
WHO HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE KEY 
ADVISORS? 
>> HE'S CAST A WIDE NET. 
IT INCLUDES SOME OF THE AIDES 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE, SOME OF THE 
PEOPLE YOU WOULD EXPECT LIKE 
CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN KELLY AND 
STEVEN MILLER WHO IS A POLICY 
ADVISOR, BUT HE WAS GOLFING 
OVER THE WEEKEND WITH SEAN 
HANNITY. 
HE HAS SOME OF THE PROMINENT 
CONSERVATIVES WHO OFF HAVE HIS 
EAR. 
THERE ARE SOME OF THE TRUMP 
LOYALISTS HE OFTEN SPEAKS TO AS 
WELL. 
HE'S ALSO CONSULTED WITH 
REPUBLICANS ON CAPITOL HILL. 
ULTIMATELY THEY WILL BE THE 
ONES WHO HOLD THE KEYS TO THE 
CONFIRMATION PROCESS. 
SO SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH 
MCCONNELL HAS HAD CONVERSATIONS 
WITH THE PRESIDENT AROUND THE 
NOMINATION AND HAS BEEN PART OF 
AT LEAST RECOMMENDING SOME OF 
THE NAMES FROM THE SHORT LIST 
OR GIVING HIS OPINION ON 
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD FACE 
A CONTENTIOUS CONFIRMATION 
BATTLE AHEAD. 
SOME, OF COURSE, ARE MORE 
CONTROVERSIAL THAN OTHERS. 
I THINK MOST INTERESTINGLY 
THERE IS THOMAS HARDIMAN WHO IS 
EMERGING AS ONE OF THE TWO 
FRONT RUNNERS. 
THAT'S SOMEONE WHO IS 
RECOMMENDED BY PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S OWN SISTER WHO SERVES 
IN FEDERAL COURT WITH HARDIMAN 
OR HAS SERVED WITH HIM. 
HE'S SOMEONE WHO DOES RELY ON 
HIS FAMILY. 
WHETHER OR NOT THAT HAS ANY 
BEARING ON THE PROCESS HERE 
REMAINS TO BE SEEN, BUT HE'S 
HAD A PRETTY INTERESTING MIX OF 
BOTH ESTABLISHMENT PICKS AS 
WELL AS RELIABLY CONSERVATIVE 
JUSTICES OR JUDGES I SHOULD SAY 
WHO COULD, OF COURSE, BE PART 
OF CEMENTING THIS CONSERVATIVE 
LEANING SUPREME COURT FOR 
DECADES TO COME. 
>> LESLIE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 
CONTENDERS IS THERE A MESSAGE 
ALREADY BEING SENT TO 
REPUBLICANS AS WE LOOK TO SEE 
WHO IT IS THE PRESIDENT WILL 
ULTIMATELY PICK? 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FOUR 
CANDIDATES WHO HAVE GOTTEN SO 
MUCH ATTENTION ALREADY BASED ON 
THEIR SORT OF JUDICIAL 
PHILOSOPHIES. 
WHAT IS IT REPUBLICANS ARE 
TAKING AWAY FROM THAT? 
>> THAT THEY WERE CORRECT TO 
VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT IN 2016. 
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE WHEN IT 
COMES TO THEM. 
THE PRESIDENT IS DELIVERING ON 
A PROMISE THAT WAS CRITICAL TO 
ASSURING BASE REPUBLICANS 
TURNED OUT. 
HE ALREADY HAD THIS KIND OF NEW 
GROWING MOVEMENT OF 
CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS. 
YOU HAD THE EVANGELIST, THE 
EVANGELICALS WHO WERE INVOLVED, 
BUT BASE REPUBLICANS WERE 
THINKING ABOUT SITTING ON THEIR 
HANDS AND THIS WAS THE 
AGREEMENT THAT WAS MADE. 
SO ANY OF THESE CANDIDATES ARE 
LOOKING VERY STRONG. 
THERE'S AN INTERESTING THING I 
KEEP LOOKING AT WITH HARDIMAN 
IS HE DID SOME PRO BONO WORK 
FOR A SPANISH SPEAKING LEGAL 
SUPPORT EFFORT FOR POLITICAL 
ASYLUM. 
>> HE SPEAK SPANISH. 
>> AND HE SPEAKS SPANISH AND HE 
THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST 
COMPELLING THINGS OF HIS ENTIRE 
CAREER. 
SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING AS 
THEY NOW IN LIGHT OF ALL OF THE 
ASYLUM ISSUES AND MOSTLY HE HAS 
TENDED TO SIDE WITH THE STATE, 
BUT THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE 
NUANCES I THINK THAT GIVES HIM 
A COMPASSIONATE HEART WHICH I 
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE 
LOOKING FOR. 
>> LESLIE, WHEN YOU CONSIDER 
THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS AND 
WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE A TOUGH 
CONFIRMATION FIGHT, WHAT DO YOU 
THINK REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS WILL 
HOPE FOR IN A NOMINEE? 
>> THEY'LL LOOK AT HOW DOES HE 
INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION? 
DOES HE BELIEVE IT'S A LIVE, 
LIVING DOCUMENT OR IS HE GOING 
TO BE MORE KIND OF TRADITIONAL 
IN HIS APPROACH? 
DID HE FOLLOW PRECEDENTS? 
YOU HAVE SOME OF THESE JURISTS 
PUSHING BACK ON LABELS IN TERMS 
OF HOW THEY SEE THEMSELVES AND 
INTERPRET THESE THINGS. 
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO 
BE PUT IN A LABEL OR IN A BOX. 
THAT MAKES THE SENATE VERY 
NERVOUS WHEN THIS HAPPENS, BUT 
I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH 
PRECEDENCE HERE THAT YOU CAN 
LOOK AT THEIR DECISIONS AND HOW 
THEY THINK TO MAKE A CRITICAL 
AND ACCURATE OBSERVATION. 
>> JOEL, WHAT ABOUT DEMOCRATS? 
IS THERE ANY IN SENT  -- 
INCENTIVE AT ALL FOR DEMOCRATS 
TO SUPPORT A NOMINEE OR IS THIS 
AN INSTANCE WHERE DEMOCRATS 
WILL OPPOSE WHOMEVER IT IS THAT 
THE PRESIDENT CHOOSES? 
>> IT DEPENDS WHO YOU ARE. 
IF YOU'RE HEIDI HEITKAMP OR JOE 
MANCHIN OR JOE DONNELLY, YOU DO 
HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO AT LEAST 
LISTEN TO WHO THE PRESIDENT 
NOMINATES AND FIGURE OUT 
WHETHER YOUR FOLKS BACK AT HOME 
WILL EITHER ALLOW YOU TO 
QUESTION OR PUSH BAG ON THE 
PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE OR WHETHER 
YOU'LL BE COMPELLED TO SUPPORT 
THIS NOMINEE EVEN IF THE 
DEMOCRATIC BASE IS AFTER YOU. 
IF YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT LIKE 
DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO WAS 
ESSENTIALLY PRIMARIED IN 
CALIFORNIA, YOU HAVE ALL THE 
PRESSURE COMING FROM THE OTHER 
END OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TELLING 
YOU DO NOT ENGAGE. 
THIS IS A STOLEN SEAT. 
THIS IS A SEAT ILL BEGOTTEN BY 
REPUBLICANS THAT MITCH 
McCONNELL FAMOUSLY STALLED FROM 
MERRICK GARLAND AND YOU HAVE 
EVERY REASON NOT TO COOPERATE 
WITH WHOEVER PRESIDENT TRUMP 
NOMINATES. 
SENATOR BOB CASEY OF 
PENNSYLVANIA CAME OUT ALREADY 
AND SAID HE DID NOT SUPPORT THE 
NOMINEE JUST OFF THE TOP AND I 
ACTUALLY THINK STRATEGICALLY 
THAT'S VERY SMART BECAUSE THAT 
TAKES HIM OFF THE GRIDDLE 
WHOEVER THE NOMINEE IS, RIGHT? 
YOU COULD BE BOXED IN IF IT'S 
SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS -- 
HARDIMAN, I BELIEVE, IS FROM 
PENNSYLVANIA, I BELIEVE. 
SO THAT KIND OF CREATED SOME 
DIFFICULT HOMESTATE POLITICS 
FOR HIM. 
HE WENT AHEAD AND TOOK THAT 
ISSUE OFF THE TABLE. 
I THINK IT DEPENDS WHO YOU ARE 
IN THAT DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS. 
>> SABRINA, WHAT'S THE 
POLITICAL REALITY FOR 
DEMOCRATS? 
IS THERE ANYTHING DEMOCRATS CAN 
DO REALISTICALLY TO STOP OR  
BLOCK A NOMINATION? 
>> I THINK THERE AREN'T A LOT 
OF TOOLS HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE 
ULTIMATELY IN THE MINORITY AND 
REPUBLICANS CAN CONFIRM A 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE WITH A 
SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE. 
THE KEY FOR DEMOCRATS IS TO 
APPLY A GREAT DEAL OF PRESSURE 
NOT JUST ON THOSE VULNERABLE 
DEMOCRATS WITHIN THEIR OWN 
CAUCUS, BUT ON THE SWING VOTES 
WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS AS 
WELL. 
SUSAN COLLINS AND LISA 
MURKOWSKI, SOME OF THE SENATORS 
WHO EXPRESSED SOME RESERVATIONS 
ABOUT ROE V. WADE, FOR EXAMPLE, 
AND DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE TO MAKE 
THIS NOMINEE SO OBJECTIONABLE 
THAT REPUBLICANS ARE UNABLE TO 
HOLD THE LINE AND PERHAPS THEY 
COULD AT BEST SINK THE 
PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE. 
IT'S GOING TO BE, OF COURSE, AN 
UPHILL BATTLE, BUT BECAUSE IT'S 
A MIDTERM ELECTION YEAR THEY DO 
FEEL THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE 
CONFIRMATION FATE FOR NEIL 
GORSUCH WHO ULTIMATELY 
REAFFIRMED THE BALANCE OF THE 
COURT. 
OF COURSE, HE WAS REPLACING THE 
LATE ANTONIN SCALIA. 
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO WILL 
DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE SUPREME 
COURT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS TO 
COME. 
I THINK THAT'S THE MESSAGE 
YOU'LL HEAR MORE FROM DEMOCRATS 
AND YOU'LL SEE THEM DRIVING 
HOME ON ISSUES LIKE ACCESS TO 
ABORTION, IMMIGRATION, 
HEALTHCARE. 
IT WAS INTERESTING JOE MANCHIN, 
ONE OF THOSE VULNERABLE 
DEMOCRATS WHO WAS INVITED TO 
THE WHITE HOUSE, HE POINTED TO 
COVERAGE OF PREEXISTING 
CONDITIONS AS SOMETHING HE'S 
GOING TO ASK ABOUT WHICH WAS 
ALLUDING TO THE IMPORTANCE OF 
OBAMACARE AND THAT THIS JUSTICE 
WOULD PERHAPS BE MORE WILLING 
TO UPHOLD PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 
HEALTHCARE LAW. 
A LOT OF IT WILL BE MORE 
CAMPAIGN ISSUES THAN TOOLS AND 
TACTICS IN THE SENATE. 
>> JOEL, LET ME ASK YOU WHAT DO 
YOU DO IF YOU ARE A JOE 
MANCHIN, HEIDI HEITKAMP, JOE 
DONNELLY? 
WHAT'S THE BEST STRATEGY FOR 
DEMOCRATS IN THE RED STATES? 
>> WELL, I THINK YOU WAIT. 
I THINK YOU WAIT TO SEE WHAT'S 
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH SUSAN 
COLLINS OR LISA MURKOWSKI 
BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY IF THOSE 
TWO REPUBLICAN SENATORS DON'T 
CROSS OVER, REPUBLICANS CAN 
JUST HOLD THE LINE AND EVEN IF 
DEMOCRATS HOLD SERVE, 
REPUBLICANS CAN GET THIS 
NOMINEE THROUGH, BUT IF YOU 
HAVE DEFLECTIONS LIKE THAT FROM 
THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS, IT DOES 
CREATE A BIT OF CRISIS FOR SOME 
OF THOSE FOLK WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT, THE JOE MANCHINS, JOE 
DONNELLYS AND HEIDI HEITKAMPS 
OF THE WORLD. 
SO I THINK YOU WAIT AND SEE 
WHAT SOME OF THE RESPONSE IS 
FROM THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AND I 
THINK YOU MAKE A DECISION BASED 
ON THAT. 
I NOTICED WHAT SABRINA NOTICED 
AS WELL. 
DEMOCRATS ARE MAKING THIS ABOUT 
HEALTHCARE. 
THEY'RE ALSO MAKING THE FRAMING 
HERE ABOUT BIG CORPORATIONS 
VERSUS WORKING CLASS PEOPLE. 
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON? 
SO THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY TRYING 
TO TURN THIS INTO AN ELECTION 
DAY ISSUE FOR NOVEMBER. 
>> LESLIE, LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT 
WHAT WE EXPECT WILL BE A TOUGH 
CONFIRMATION FIGHT. 
DOES THAT ACTUALLY ULTIMATELY 
HELP REPUBLICANS IN THE 
MIDTERMS? 
>> IT DEPENDS WHO THEY'RE 
FIGHTING. 
ARE THEY FIGHTING REPUBLICANS 
WITHIN THE CONSERVATIVES OR 
BATTLING AGAINST EACH OTHER. 
WE LIKE TO KILL OUR OWN. 
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP 
ANYBODY. 
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT. 
THE BENEFIT OF THIS IS YOU HAVE 
KIND OF A CONSENSUS 
CONSERVATIVE JURISTS THAT 
PEOPLE CAN FUNDAMENTALLY GET 
BEHIND EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW 
IT'S NOT PERFECT. 
IT'S LIKE AN UMBRELLA. 
IT DOES GIVE YOU COVER FOR MOST 
THINGS. 
PEOPLE CAN ACCEPT THAT. 
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT ALL 
THAT IS THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
TRYING TO MAKE THIS AN ISSUE ON 
ABORTION AND ROE V. WADE. 
SOMEBODY LIKE HARDIMAN DOESN'T 
HAVE A STRONG POSITION. 
IF THE PRESIDENT CAN NEUTRALIZE 
THAT WITH McCONNELL AND GIVE 
SOME ASSURANCE THAT THAT'S NOT 
WHAT THIS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT. 
IT'S NOT ABOUT CHANGING 
PRECEDENCE ON THIS. 
I DO BELIEVE IT'S VERY 
IMPACTFUL IN NEUTRALIZING THE 
DEMOCRATIC ARGUMENT ACROSS THE 
BOARD. 
>> CAITLYN, HOW INTENSE DO YOU 
THINK THAT PRESSURE WILL BE 
GOING BACK TO THE DEMOCRATS A 
MOMENT? 
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THEM DECLINE 
THE WHITE HOUSE'S INVITATION 
FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT TONIGHT, 
ALL THREE OF THE DEMOCRATS 
WE'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT. 
HOW MUCH POLITICAL PRESSURE DO 
YOU THINK THOSE DEMOCRATS IN 
RED STATES WILL BE FACING? 
>> IT'S GOING TO BE VERY 
INTENSE. 
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THEIR 
REPUBLICAN CHALLENGERS MAKING 
THIS AN ISSUE IN THEIR 
CAMPAIGNS. 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT INDIANA, 
WEST VIRGINIA AND NORTH DAKOTA. 
THOSE ARE WHERE DEMOCRATS ARE 
UP FOR REELECTION IN STATE 
TRUMP WON OVERWHELMINGLY AND 
THOSE ARE ALSO DEMOCRATS THAT 
DID CROSS THE AISLE LAST TIME 
AND VOTE FOR GORSUCH. 
THE DIFFERENCE, THOUGH, IS 
BECAUSE AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT, THIS IS A SEAT THAT 
COULD POTENTIALLY CHANGE THE 
BALANCE OF POWER OR THE 
IDEOLOGICAL MAKEUP OF THE 
COURT. 
SO THIS IS A MUCH MORE 
DIFFICULT DECISION FOR THESE 
LAWMAKERS TO MAKE AND DEMOCRATS 
REALLY HAVE TO KIND OF WEIGH 
TWO THINGS HERE. 
ONE IS THE IDEA THAT THE 
DEMOCRATIC BASE IS SO ENERGIZED 
BY BEING AGAINST ANYTHING THAT 
TRUMP IS FOR, BUT ALSO REALLY 
ENERGIZED ON KEY ISSUES LIKE 
HEALTHCARE, ACCESS TO ABORTION, 
VOTING RIGHTS, SOME OTHER 
THINGS THAT ARE REALLY 
ANIMATING THAT BASE, BALANCED 
WITH THE IDEA THAT AS A RED 
STATE DEMOCRAT, PARTICULARLY IN 
A STATE THAT TRUMP WON 
OVERWHELMINGLY, YOU DON'T 
REALLY HAVE THE LUXURY OF 
DEPENDING JUST ON THAT 
DEMOCRATIC BASE. 
YOU HAVE TO GET SOME 
REPUBLICANS AND, OF COURSE, YOU 
HAVE TO GET THOSE INDEPENDENTS. 
SO IF YOU HAVE THE REPUBLICANS 
ON THE OTHER SIDE MAKING THIS 
AN ISSUE AND PUTTING MONEY 
BEHIND MAKING THIS AN ISSUE IN 
CAMPAIGNS, I THINK IT MAKES IT 
VERY DIFFICULT. 
YOU ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE 
TIMELINE. 
A VOTE HAPPENING IN SEPTEMBER 
OR OCTOBER, WE KNOW THIS NEWS 
CYCLE MOVES VERY FAST. 
WE COULD BE ON TO OTHER ISSUES 
COME NOVEMBER, BUT IT DOES 
PLACE THAT CRITICAL VOTE IN THE 
SPOTLIGHT WHICH UPS THE ANTE 
FOR A LOT OF DEMOCRATS. 
>> SABRINA, IF YOU COULD JUST 
UNDERSCORE FOR US HOW DIFFERENT 
IS THIS PARTICULAR PICK FROM 
NEIL GORSUCH'S PICK? 
>> IT'S DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT 
AS CAITLYN SAID AND WE'VE 
TALKED ABOUT. 
THIS IS NOT SOMEONE REAFFIRMING 
THE BALANCE OF THE COURT AS IT 
CURRENTLY EXISTS. 
YOU ARE LOSING ANTHONY KENNEDY 
WHO HAS BEEN A PIVOTAL SWING 
VOTE ON ISSUES THAT INCLUDE 
ACCESS TO ABORTION, LGBT 
RIGHTS. 
I THINK CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN 
ROBERTS HAS SOMETIMES ANGERED 
CONSERVATIVES, MOST INFAMOUSLY 
WHEN HE VOTED TO UPHOLD THE 
HEART OF OBAMACARE, BUT FOR THE 
MOST PART I THINK WHAT YOU WILL 
SEE IS A DECIDEDLY CONSERVATIVE 
BALANCE WITHIN THE SUPREME 
COURT AND THAT'S WHY DEMOCRATS 
DO BELIEVE THEY DO PERHAPS HAVE 
MORE PER SWAYING AT LEAST IN 
THE EYES OF THE PUBLIC WHEN -- 
PERSUASION AT LEAST IN THE EYES 
OF THE PUBLIC WHEN IT COMES TO 
THE BATTLE THAT IS MOVING AHEAD 
BECAUSE THEY COULD ELEVATE SOME 
OF THESE ISSUES AND MAKE THIS A 
LOT MORE ABOUT A DECISIVE 
QUESTION AS TO WHAT THE FUTURE 
OF AMERICA WILL LOOK LIKE ON 
ISSUES THAT ALSO INCLUDE 
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, VOTING 
RIGHTS. 
THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF ISSUES 
THAT ARE BEFORE THE COURT, THE 
TRAVEL BAN MOST RECENTLY BEING 
ANOTHER BIG RULING WHERE YOU 
SAW THE IMPACT OF ANTHONY 
KENNEDY STILL BEING THERE, BUT 
YOU STILL SAW THE IMPACT OF 
WHAT COULD BE, OF COURSE, A 
FUTURE COURT LOOKING AT A 
SIMILAR CASE AND PERHAPS HAVING 
MORE FAR REACHING CONSEQUENCES. 
SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS 
ABOUT. 
>> LESLIE, WE KNOW ONCE THE 
PICK IS ANNOUNCED THAT FORMER 
ARIZONA SENATOR JON KYL WILL BE 
THE "SHERPA" WHO ESSENTIALL 
GUIDES THE NOMINEE THROUGH THAT 
PROCESS AND BASICALLY GOES 
THROUGH THE MEETINGS ON CAPITOL 
HILL, HELPS THEM THROUGH THAT 
PROCESS. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE STRATEGY 
WAS IN CHOOSING JON KYL? 
>> IT'S SOMEBODY WHO OBVIOUSLY 
HAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF 
EXPERIENCE ON THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, HAVING 
SEEN IT AND UNDERSTANDS THE 
ATTEMPTS, KNOWS THE STAFF AND 
WHERE THE PITFALLS ARE. 
ALSO ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES IS 
GOING TO BE RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS. 
THAT COMES UP CONSISTENTLY. 
IT'S COME UP NOW AND HOW THAT 
IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE THAT 
GALVANIZES THE BASE, BUT IT'S 
UNDERSTANDING THE POINTS OF ALL 
THOSE MEMBERS, WHAT'S GOING TO 
BE IMPORTANT TO THEM AND THAT'S 
BASICALLY GETTING THAT NOMINEE 
UP TO SPEED EXTREMELY QUICKLY 
WITH THE CLIP NOTES, SO TO 
SPEAK, HOW TO EXCEL AND SUCCEED 
WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL SENATOR. 
>> AS YOU'VE BEEN SPEAKING, 
LESLIE, WE'VE BEEN WATCHING 
OUTSIDE THE SUPREME COURT. 
THERE YOU SEE PROTESTERS 
DEMONSTRATING. 
I'M READING THE SIGNS THERE. 
DON'T CRIMINALIZE ABORTION SOME 
OF THOSE SIGNS SAY. 
WE THE PEOPLE, I SEE SIGNS FOR 
REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. 
SO WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
MONITOR OBVIOUSLY. 
THERE YOU SEE ANOTHER SIGN 
PROTECT ROE. 
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
MONITOR WHAT IS TAKING PLACE 
THERE AS WE WAIT FOR PRESIDENT 
TRUMP TO ANNOUNCE THAT PICK IN 
JUST ABOUT LESS THAN 15 MINUTES 
OR SO WE'RE EXPECTING THAT TO 
TAKE PLACE. 
MY THANKS TO YOU ALL. 
>>> CBS NEWS POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT ED O'KEEFE JOINS 
ME NOW FROM WASHINGTON. 
WHAT IS IT YOU'RE HEARING, IF 
ANYTHING, ABOUT WHO THE 
PRESIDENT'S FRONTRUNNER MAY BE? 
>> Reporter:  AS OUR COLLEAGUE 
JAN CRAWFORD WHO COVERS THE 
COURT CLOSELY REPORTED EARLIER, 
EVERYTHING APPEARS TO BE 
LEANING TOWARDS BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, THIS FORMER GEORGE 
W. BUSH STAFF SECRETARY, FORMER 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WHO 
SERVES ON COURT OF APPEALS FOR 
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FOR 
THE CIRCUIT IN D.C., A COURT 
THAT HAS PRODUCED MANY OTHER 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES IN THE 
PAST. 
THE LAST FEW DAYS WE KNOW THE 
PRESIDENT HAS REVIEWED THE 
NAMES OF FOUR POTENTIAL 
NOMINEES AND AGAIN ALL SIGNS AT 
THIS HOUR, AT LEAST IF YOU 
BELIEVE AND WE SHOULD THE 
REPORTING OF OUR COLLEAGUE JAN 
CRAWFORD AND OTHERS, IT LOOKS 
AS IF IT MAY BE JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, BUT THIS IS A 
PRESIDENT WHO HAS MANAGED TODAY 
AT LEAST TO KEEP A PRETTY GOOD 
SECRET OR IF PEOPLE IN TOWN 
KNOW, HAVEN'T REVEALED WHEN IT 
IS. 
KEEP THE DRAMA AND SUSPENSE 
THAT SURROUNDED THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF NEIL GORSUCH 
LAST YEAR HOPING THEY CAN DO IT 
THIS YEAR WITH THIS 
ANNOUNCEMENT TONIGHT IN THE 
EAST ROOM. 
>> AS WE CONTINUE TO WATCH 
WASHINGTON, THERE YOU SEE 
INSIDE THE EAST ROOM WHERE 
PEOPLE ARE GATHERING NOW AS WE 
AWAIT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS PICK FOR 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. 
ED, LET ME ASK YOU WHEN IT 
COMES TO LAWMAKERS ON CAPITAL 
HIM, AS YOU LOOK AT THOSE FOUR 
CONTENDERS, IS THERE A SENSE 
AMONG REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS IN 
PARTICULAR THEY'VE ALREADY 
SECURED A VICTORY HERE? 
>> Reporter:  NO. 
BECAUSE THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT 
THE POSSIBILITY THAT ONE, TWO, 
MAYBE AS MANY AS THREE 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS WOULD HAVE 
SOME CONCERN WITH WHOEVER IT IS 
THE PRESIDENT PICKS. 
A LOT OF THE FOCUS RIGHT NOW, 
OF COURSE, IS ON SUSAN COLLINS 
OF MAINE, LISA MURKOWSKI OF 
ALASKA, JOHN McCAIN OF ARIZONA 
SHOULD HE BE ABLE TO COME TO 
WASHINGTON AND VOTE, BUT THERE 
COULD BE SOME OTHER UNFORESEEN 
ISSUE OR CIRCUMSTANCE THAT 
MIGHT COMPEL ANOTHER REPUBLICAN 
SENATOR POTENTIALLY TO OPPOSE 
THE PICK. 
OTHERWISE AS MANY DEMOCRATS 
HAVE POINTED OUT, IT'S 
ESSENTIALLY THE REPUBLICANS 
GAME OR NOMINATION TO LOSE 
BECAUSE DEMOCRATS ARE 
COMPLETELY HAMSTRUNG UNABLE TO 
DO ANYTHING REALLY TO STOP THIS 
FROM HAPPENING OTHER THAN TO 
PUT PRESSURE ON AT LEAST ONE 
REPUBLICAN, MAYBE TWO FOR 
WHATEVER REASON TO VOTE NO. 
>> ED, WHAT KIND OF REACTION 
WILL YOU EXPECT TO SATISFACTORY 
-- TO SEE FROM LAWMAKERS ON 
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE ONCE 
THE ANNOUNCEMENT IS ANNOUNCED? 
>> Reporter:  ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT'S EXPECTED WHEN THE WHITE 
HOUSE UNVEILS THE NOMINEE IS 
THEY HAVE INVITED A HANDFUL OF 
WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE ONLY 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS TO BE IN 
THE EAST ROOM TONIGHT FOR THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT. 
THE GENIUS IN THAT FROM A 
COMMUNICATIONS PERSPECTIVE IS 
THAT THEY WILL THEN RUN TO THE 
CAMERAS IN THE ROOM AND START 
TO IMMEDIATELY SORT OF CONVEY 
WHY THEY THINK THIS PERSON IS A 
BRILLIANT PICK AND WHY IT'S 
SOMEONE THE SENATE SHOULD 
QUICKLY CONFIRM AND PUT ON THE 
COURT. 
THAT'S SORT OF A NEWER WAY OF 
DOING THIS AND WE'RE GOING TO 
SEE THIS NOMINEE WE'RE TOLD 
TOMORROW AT THE CAPITAL 
BEGINNING TO MAKE THEIR ROUNDS 
TO MEET WITH SENATE MAJORITY 
MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL 
-- SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH 
McCONNELL. 
THE AVERAGE CONFIRMATION LENGTH 
IS 107 DAYS. 
THAT IS A TIMELINE THEY HOPE 
THEY CAN FULFILL IN THIS CASE 
IN GETTING THE NEW JUSTICE ON 
THE BENCH BY THE FIRST MONDAY 
IN OCTOBER WHEN THE SUPREME 
COURT RECONVENES. 
>> WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW 
OBVIOUSLY THE DYNAMIC IS 
DIFFERENT COMPARED TO WHEN NEIL 
GORSUCH WAS CHOSEN CONSIDERING 
AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
HERE IN NEW YORK THIS PICK IS 
EXPECTED TO MOVE THE COURT MORE 
SOLIDLY TO THE RIGHT. 
I WONDER IF THAT'S SORT OF A 
PALPABLE FEELING THAT YOU'RE 
SENSING AS WELL IN WASHINGTON 
BECAUSE THOSE STAKES ARE HIGHER 
SOME HAVE ARGUED WITH THIS 
SUPREME COURT PICK. 
>> Reporter:  SURE. 
THAT IS THE WAY PEOPLE READ IT 
HERE IF THE PRESIDENT IS INDEED 
WORKING OFF THIS LIST OF FOUR 
JUSTICES THAT HAS BEEN TALKED 
ABOUT NOW FOR THREE DAYS 
BECAUSE ALL OF THEM ESSENTIALLY 
HAVE A RECORD THAT SUGGESTS 
THEY ARE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES 
IN THE MOLD OF ANTONIN SCALIA 
OR NEIL GORSUCH OR SAMUEL ALITO 
AND THAT THERE AREN'T ANY 
SURPRISES NECESSARILY OR 
REASONS TO DOUBT THAT THEY 
WOULD RULE IN FAVOR OF THE 
CONSERVATIVE LEGAL VIEWPOINTS. 
SO THAT IS WHAT SORT OF FEEDS 
THIS INEVITABILITY FOR 
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND 
LIBERALS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT 
COULD TRANSPIRE IN THE COMING 
YEARS SHOULD THIS PERSON GET ON 
THE BENCH AND IT PERHAPS BEGIN 
TO TILT MORE TO THE RIGHT. 
OF COURSE, THE ONE THING TO 
REMEMBER IS WHEN SOMEBODY IS ON 
THE COURT, THERE'S NO GUARANTEE 
THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE A CERTAIN 
WAY. 
A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES ARE 
STILL UPSET WITH CHIEF JUSTICE 
ROBERTS FOR THE WAY HE SIDED 
WITH THE LIBERAL JUSTICES TO 
UPHOLD MOST OF THE ACQUISITION 
ACT A FEW YEARS AGO EVER SINCE 
-- AFFORDABLE CARE ACT A FEW 
YEARS AGO EVER SINCE THEN AND 
PRESIDENT TRUMP CAMPAIGNED 
VOWING TO PUT JUSTICES ON THE 
COURT WHO WOULDN'T DO WHAT 
ROBERTS DID. 
SO IF THIS PERSON PROVES TO BE 
THE CONSERVATIVE MANY 
REPUBLICANS ARE HOPING FOR, IT 
WILL BE SEEN AS A BIG SUCCESS. 
>> ED, I WONDER WHAT YOU'VE 
BEEN HEARING ABOUT THE 
POLITICAL PRESSURE ON THOSE 
DEMOCRATS IN RED STATES AND I 
KNOW YOU'VE TALKED TO THE 
OFFICES OF SEVERAL OF THOSE 
DEMOCRATS. 
THERE YOU SEE, BY THE WAY, VICE 
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE AND MITCH 
McCONNELL IN THE EAST ROOM. 
I BELIEVE SENATOR GRASSLEY IS 
BEHIND THERE. 
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN HEARING, ED, 
ABOUT WHAT IT IS THEY'RE FACING 
HERE AS THEY TRY TO FIGURE OUT 
A STRATEGY TO NAVIGATE THIS 
PARTICULAR ISSUE? 
>> Reporter:  I GOT ON THE 
PHONE WITH DEMOCRATIC AIDES 
TODAY AND THE PHONE 
CONVERSATION BEGAN WITH SOME 
KIND OF A SIGH FROM THEM 
BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT'S COMING 
HERE. 
IT'S GOING TO BE AN INTENSE 
AMOUNT OF PRESSURE APPLIED FROM 
HERE IN WASHINGTON AND BACK 
HOME, ESPECIALLY ON THE AIR 
WAVES, BUT ALSO AMONG 
GRASSROOTS GROUPS WHO ARE GOING 
TO BE PUSHING FOR THEIR 
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR UP FOR 
REELECTION THIS YEAR TO SUPPORT 
WHOEVER IT IS THE PRESIDENT 
NOMINATES, BUT LOOK, YOU TALK 
TO DEMOCRATS ESPECIALLY AND 
THEY SAY WE DON'T NECESSARILY 
SEE EVIDENCE RIGHT NOW THAT HOW 
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS AND 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS VOTE ON THE 
SUPREME COURT IS GOING TO BE AS 
BIG OF MOTIVATING FACTOR AS 
GENERAL CONCERNS ABOUT 
HEALTHCARE, THE TAX REFORM 
PLAN, CONTINUED QUESTIONS ABOUT 
LEGAL ISSUES SURROUNDING THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
YOU SAY LOOK, ALL THOSE ISSUES 
COULD COME BEFORE THE COURT IN 
THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND THEY SAY 
YES, OF COURSE, BUT WHAT'S 
GOING TO DRIVE PEOPLE OUT IS 
NOT SOMEBODY HAS BEEN NOMINATED 
OR NOT, WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE 
BEEN CONFIRMED. 
IT'S ALL THESE OTHER AS THEY 
KEPT SAYING KITCHEN TABLE 
ISSUES THEY BELIEVE WILL DRIVE 
TURNOUT. 
I THINK BEYOND THE MOST BASE 
VOTERS ON THE OTHER SIDE IS 
THERE GOING TO BE OTHERS. 
COULD IT BE A LAST MINUTE WEDGE 
ISSUE OR MOTIVATING FACTOR? 
PERHAPS. 
>> ED, THERE WE SEE THE 
PRESIDENT'S ATTORNEY, RUDY 
GUILIANI, AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE 
GATHERED THERE IN THE EAST 
ROOM. 
I WONDER, ED, IF I COULD GET 
YOUR THOUGHTS BECAUSE AMONG 
THOSE LAWMAKERS AS WELL THAT 
YOU MENTIONED, THE REPUBLICAN 
LAWMAKERS WHO WERE INVITED, 
THERE WE SEE REPUBLICAN SENATOR 
JEFF FLAKE OF ARIZONA. 
REMIND OUR VIEWERS, ED, WHAT 
HAS BEEN THE RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN THIS WHITE HOUSE AND 
THAT SENATOR? 
>> Reporter:  THERE'S A REASON 
JEFF FLAKE SHOWS UP FOR THIS. 
WHILE THEY'VE HAD DISAGREEMENTS 
OVER TONE AND TEMPERAMENT, 
THEIR OPINIONS ON JOHN McCAIN 
AND TRADE ISSUES, THE ONE AREA 
WHERE JEFF FLAKE HAS ALWAYS 
BEEN IN NEAR LOCK STEP WITH THE 
PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE 
IS ON JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS. 
HE HAS TOLD ME AND OTHERS HERE 
AT CBS REPEATEDLY HOW PLEASED 
HE'S BEEN WITH THE WHITE 
HOUSE'S MANAGEMENT OF JUDICIAL 
APPOINTMENTS, GETTING THEM UP 
TO THE SENATE, GETTING THE 
SENATE TO CONFIRM THEM AND 
PICKING PEOPLE WHO HE BELIEVES 
ARE SUFFICIENTLY CONSERVATIVE 
AND QUALIFIED TO BE ON BENCH. 
HE WAS THRILLED WITH THE NEIL 
GORSUCH DECISION LAST YEAR IN 
PART BECAUSE GORSUCH HAILS FROM 
THE WEST AND IS NOT SOMEBODY 
WHO RESIDES OR STUDIED OR WAS 
BORN EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI. 
THAT PROBABLY WON'T BE THE CASE 
TONIGHT AS THE FOUR NAMES THAT 
WE KNOW ARE IN THE MIX ARE ALL 
FROM EITHER THE CENTRAL TIME 
ZONE OR EASTERN TIME ZONE, BUT 
FLAKE AS A MEMBER OF THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS BEEN 
QUITE PLEASED WITH THE WAY THE 
ADMINISTRATION HAS HANDLED 
JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS AND 
THAT'S WHY HE'S THERE TONIGHT. 
>> AS WE CONTINUE TO SEE 
LAWMAKERS AND JUDICIARIES FILE 
INTO THE EAST ROOM, THERE'S 
SENATOR TED CRUZ OF TEXAS, HOW 
GALVANIZING OF AN ISSUE DO YOU 
THINK THIS SUPREME COURT PICK 
WILL BE FOR REPUBLICANS THIS 
MIDTERM ELECTION YEAR? 
>> Reporter:  ABSOLUTELY 
GALVANIZING BECAUSE YOU WILL 
SEE THE ESTABLISHMENT CLOSE 
RANKS BEHIND WHOEVER THE 
NOMINEE IS AND PUSH TO INSURE 
THAT THIS PERSON IS SWIFTLY 
CONFIRMED. 
WHETHER PEOPLE TURN OUT IN 
NOVEMBER TO THANK THE PRESIDENT 
AND SENATE REPUBLICANS FOR 
GETTING THIS PERSON ON TO THE 
COURT IF IT'S DONE BY ELECTION 
DAY REMAINS TO BE SEEN, BUT YOU 
BETTER BELIEVE THAT IN THE 
COMING HOURS THIS PERSON WILL 
QUICKLY BECOME A WELL KNOWN 
NAME AMONG CONSERVATIVES IN 
THIS COUNTRY WHO SUPPORT THE 
PRESIDENT, REPUBLICANS WHO ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE BALANCE OF 
THE COURT. 
LET'S REMEMBER BACK IN 2016 
ROUGHLY 20% OF VOTERS SAID IN 
THE EXIT POLLS ONE OF THE 
REASONS THEY TURNED OUT AND 
VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP WAS OUT 
OF CONCERN OVER THE FUTURE OF 
THE IDEOLOGICAL BALANCE OF THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
THAT WAS THE HIGHEST THAT THE 
SUPREME COURT HAD EVER MEASURED 
IN SORT OF ISSUES OF CONCERN ON 
A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DAY. 
FOR THE LAST THREE WEEK OF THE 
CAMPAIGN DONALD TRUMP TRAVELED 
THE COUNTRY SAYING YOU MAY NOT 
LIKE ME PERSONALLY, BUT YOU 
KNOW THAT I'M GOING TO APPOINT 
SOMEBODY FAR MORE CONSERVATIVE 
THAN HILLARY CLINTON EVER WOULD 
AND THE EXIT POLLING SHOWED IN 
THE END THAT THAT WAS A 
MOTIVATING FACTOR FOR MANY 
REPUBLICANS, CONSERVATIVES OR 
RIGHT LEANING INDEPENDENS WHO 
SHOWED UP TO VOTE FOR HIM ON 
ELECTION DAY. 
>> ED O'KEEFE IN WASHINGTON FOR 
US, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
WHOMEVER PRESIDENT TRUMP PICKS 
AS HIS SUPREME COURT NOMINEE 
WILL HAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON 
THE INTERPRETATION OF U.S. LAW 
FOR DECADES TO COME. 
THE FOUR LEADING CANDIDATES 
HAVE SEVERAL SIMILARITIES. 
THEY'RE ALL APPELLATE JUDGES,  
UNDER THE AGE OF 53 AND 
CONSIDERED RIGHT OF CENTER 
POLITICALLY, BUT THEY ALL HAVE 
PLENTY OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 
THEM. 
JOINING ME NOW IS JESSE WEBER, 
ATTORNEY AND HOST OF THE CRIME 
NETWORK. 
WE ONLY HAVE A COUPLE MINUTES 
LEFT, BUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
TOPICS IN WASHINGTON AFTER 
JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY 
ANNOUNCED HIS RETIREMENT WAS 
WHAT THE FUTURE OF ROE VERSUS 
WADE WOULD BE. 
HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMIC 
HERE. 
WITH THESE PICKS WAS THERE ONE 
NOMINEE OR ONE POTENTIAL 
NOMINEE IN PARTICULAR THAT 
STOOD OUT IN TERMS OF BEING 
PARTICULARLY FORCEFUL AGAINST 
ABORTION RIGHTS? 
>> I'M SO HAPPY YOU BROUGHT 
THIS UP. 
EVERYBODY CONSIDERS THAT A 
MAJORITY CONSERVATIVE COURT 
AUTOMATICALLY MEANS ROE V. WADE 
WILL BE OVERTURNED. 
IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE 
NOMINEES, NO ONE HAS MADE AN 
EXPLICIT STATEMENT SAYING I'M 
GOING TO OVERTURN THIS. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT AMY BARRETT, 
THOUGH, SHE HAS MADE IT VERY 
CLEAR THAT SHE LOOKS AT 
PRECEDENT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.
IT GIVES THE IDEA AND REMEMBER 
THAT CASE WAS DECIDED ON A 
RIGHT OF PRIVACY GROUNDS AND 
SHE HAS SAID THE CONSTITUTION 
DOESN'T EXPRESSLY PROTECT THAT 
RIGHT. 
SO IF I'M INTERPRETING HER AS 
SHE WOULD INTERPRET THE 
CONSTITUTION, PEOPLE COULD LOOK 
AT HER AND SAY SHE MIGHT BE A 
THREAT TO ROE V. WADE. 
JUST TO STEP BACK, NO MATTER 
WHO IS NOMINATED IT'S NOT THAT 
SIMPLE TO GET THAT OVERTURNED. 
IT IS A LONG PROCESS. 
YOU NEED THE RIGHT CASE. 
YOU NEED IT TO GO THROUGH THE 
COURT SYSTEM. 
THE SUPREME COURT HAS TO TAKE 
IT UP AND THEY HAVE TO DECIDE 
IT ON A SPECIFIC ISSUE. 
AGAIN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A 
MAJORITY SUPREME COURT, YES, 
THAT'S THE CONVERSATION. 
>> JESSE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>>> THIS IS A CBS NEWS SPECIAL 
REPORT. 
I'M JEFF GLOR REPORTING FROM 
WASHINGTON TONIGHT. 
THE SUSPENSE AND SPECULATION IS 
COMING TO AN END. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABOUT TO 
INTRODUCE HIS NOMINEE TO 
REPLACE RETIRING JUSTICE 
ANTHONY KENNEDY ON THE SUPREME 
COURT.    
THIS WILL BE MR. TRUMP'S SECOND 
APPOINTMENT AFTER NEIL GORSUCH 
AS THE PRESIDENT SHAPES THE 
NATION'S HIGHEST COURT FOR 
YEARS TO COME. 
HE'LL BE MAKING THIS 
ANNOUNCEMENT AND MAKING THE 
INTRODUCTION IN THE EAST ROOM 
OF THE WHITE HOUSE. 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT RIGHT 
NOW IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS. 
PROTESTERS HAVE GATHERED 
OUTSIDE THE SUPREME COURT 
BUILDING A COUPLE OF MILES 
AWAY, PROTESTING ON BOTH SIDES 
OF THE ROE V. WADE ISSUE. 
JAN CRAWFORD IS OUR CHIEF LEGAL 
CORRESPONDENT, COVERING THE 
SUPREME COURT FOR US. 
MARGARET BRENNAN, OF COURSE, 
THE MODERATOR OF FACE THE 
NATION. 
WELCOME TO BOTH OF YOU. 
JAN, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR 
HERE? 
>> WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IN 
THOSE IMAGES WE WERE JUST 
SEEING, WHO IS IN THAT ROOM. 
OF COURSE, FROM THE VERY 
BEGINNING, JUDGE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN THE FRONT 
RUNNER AND A GOOD CLUE IS HIS 
PARENTS HAVE BEEN SPOTTED IN 
THE ROOM AS WELL AS SEVERAL OF 
HIS FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES. 
THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO KEEP 
THINGS DRAMATIC AND CERTAINLY 
HE IS KEEPING THIS CLOSE UNTIL 
THE VERY END. 
BUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH WOULD BE A 
SOLID CONSERVATIVE PICK. 
CONSERVATIVES WOULD BE VERY 
HAPPY WITH THIS. 
HE IS A HIGHLY REGARDED FEDERAL 
APPEAL'S COURT JUDGE HERE. 
>> BRETT KAVANAUGH, 53 YEARS 
OLD AS YOU SAID, WORKS HERE IN 
WASHINGTON, D.C., WIDELY 
EXPECTED TO BE THE PICK. 
LET'S WATCH AND LISTEN TO THE 
PRESIDENT.  
    
>>> MY FELLOW AMERICANS. 
TONIGHT I SPEAK TO YOU FROM THE 
EAST ROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE 
REGARDING ONE OF THE MOST 
PROFOUND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
AND THAT IS THE SELECTION OF A 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. 
I'VE OFTEN HEARD THAT OTHER 
THAN MATTERS OF WAR AND PEACE, 
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
DECISION A PRESIDENT WILL MAKE. 
THE SUPREME COURT IS ENTRUSTED 
WITH THE SAFEGUARDING OF THE 
CROWN JEWEL OF OUR REPUBLIC., 
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
12 DAYS AGO JUSTICE ANTHONY 
KENNEDY INFORMED ME OF HIS 
DECISION TO TAKE SENIOR STATUS 
ON THE SUPREME COURT, OPENING A 
NEW VACANCY. 
FOR MORE THAN FOUR DECADES, 
JUSTICE KENNEDY SERVED OUR 
NATION WITH INCREDIBLE PASSION 
AND DEVOTION. 
I'D LIKE TO THANK JUSTICE 
KENNEDY FOR A LIFETIME OF 
DISTINGUISHED SERVICE. 
    
(APPLAUSE)
IN A FEW MOMENTS I WILL 
ANNOUNCE MY SELECTION FOR 
JUSTICE KENNEDY'S REPLACEMENT. 
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE 
BEEN FACED WITH THIS TASK. 
LAST YEAR I NOMINATED JUDGE 
NEIL GORSUCH TO REPLACE THE 
LATE GREAT JUSTICE ANTONIN 
SCALIA. 
  
(APPLAUSE)
I CHOSE JUSTICE GORSUCH BECAUSE 
I KNEW THAT HE, JUST LIKE 
JUSTICE SCALIA, WOULD BE A 
FAITHFUL SERVANT OF OUR 
CONSTITUTION. 
WE ARE HONORED TO BE JOINED 
TONIGHT BY JUSTICE SCALIA'S 
BELOVED WIFE, MAUREEN. 
    
BOTH JUSTICE KENNEDY AND 
JUSTICE SCALIA WERE APPOINTED 
BY A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTOOD 
THAT THE BEST DEFENSE OF OUR 
LIBERTY AND JUDICIAL BRANCH, 
IMMUNED FROM POLITICAL 
PREJUDICE WERE JUDGES THAT 
APPLY THE CONSTITUTION AS 
WRITTEN. 
THAT PRESIDENT HAPPENED TO BE 
RONALD REAGAN. 
FOR THIS EVENING'S 
ANNOUNCEMENT, WE ARE JOINED BY 
RONALD REAGAN'S ATTORNEY 
GENERAL EDWIN. 
   
ED?
(APPLAUSE)
IN THAT I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE, 
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE 
DONE TO PROTECT OUR NATION'S 
GREAT LEGAL HERITAGE. 
IN KEEPING WITH PRESIDENT 
REAGAN'S LEGACY, I DO NOT ASK 
ABOUT A NOMINEE'S PERSONAL 
OPINIONS. 
WHAT MATTERS IS NOT A JUDGE'S 
POLITICAL VIEWS, BUT WHETHER 
THEY CAN SET ASIDE THOSE VIEWS 
TO DO WHAT THE LAW AND THE 
CONSTITUTION REQUIRES. 
I AM PLEASED TO SAY THAT I HAVE 
FOUND WITHOUT DOUBT SUCH A 
PERSON. 
TONIGHT IT IS MY HONOR AND 
PRIVILEGE TO ANNOUNCE THAT I 
WILL NOMINATE JUDGE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH TO THE UNITED STATES 
SUPREME COURT. 
  
(APPLAUSE)
    
    
    
I KNOW THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM 
VERY WELL. 
THEY DO NOT STAND AND GIVE 
APPLAUSE LIKE THAT VERY OFTEN, 
SO THEY HAVE SOME RESPECT. 
BRETT'S WIFE, ASHLEY, AND THEIR 
TWO DAUGHTERS, MARGARET AND 
LISA HAVE JOINED US HERE ON THE 
PODIUM. 
CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AS A 
FAMILY. 
THANK YOU.  
    
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS IMPECCABLE 
CREDENTIALS, UNSURPASSED 
QUALIFICATIONS AND A PROVEN 
COMMITMENT TO EQUAL JUSTICE 
UNDER THE LAW. 
A GRADUATE OF YALE COLLEGE AND 
YALE LAW SCHOOL, JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH CURRENTLY TEACHES AT 
HARVARD, YALE, AND GEORGETOWN. 
 
CONSIDERED A JUDGE'S JUDGE, A 
TRUE THOUGHT LEADER AMONG HIS 
PEERS. 
HE'S A BRILLIANT JURIST WITH A 
CLEAR AND EFFECTIVE WRITING 
STYLE UNIVERSALLY REGARDED AS 
ONE OF THE FINEST AND SHARPEST 
LEGAL MINDS OF OUR TIME. 
AND JUST LIKE JUSTICE GORSUCH, 
HE EXCELLED AS A CLERK FOR 
JUSTICE KENNEDY. 
IT'S GREAT, THANK YOU. 
    
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS DEVOTED HIS 
LIFE TO PUBLIC SERVICE. 
FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS, HE HAS 
SERVED AS A JUDGE ON THE D.C. 
CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS WITH 
GREAT DISTINCTION, OFFERING 
OVER 300 OPINIONS THAT HAVE 
BEEN WIDELY ADMIRED FOR ITS 
SKILL, INSIGHT, AND RIGOROUS 
ADHERENCE TO THE LAW. 
AMONG THOSE OPINIONS ARE MORE 
THAN A DOZEN THAT THE SUPREME 
COURT HAS ADOPTED AS THE LAW OF 
THE LAND BEYOND HIS GREAT 
REKNOWN AS A JUDGE, HE IS 
ACTIVE IN HIS COMMUNITY. 
HE COACHES CYO BASKETBALL, 
SERVES MEALS TO NEEDY FAMILIES, 
AND HAVING LEARNED FROM HIS MOM 
WHO IS A SCHOOLTEACHER IN D.C., 
TUTORS CHILDREN AT LOCAL 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
THERE IS NO ONE IN AMERICA MORE 
QUALIFIED FOR THIS POSITION AND 
NO ONE MORE DESERVING. 
I WANT TO THANK THE SENATORS ON 
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. 
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATS FOR 
THEIR CONSULTATION AND ADVICE 
DURING THE SELECTION PROCESS. 
THIS INCREDIBLY QUALIFIED 
NOMINEE DESERVES A SWIFT 
CONFIRMATION AND ROBUST 
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. 
THE RULE OF LAW IS OUR NATION'S 
PROUD HERITAGE. 
IT IS THE CORNER STONE OF OUR 
FREEDOM. 
IT IS WHAT GUARANTEES EQUAL 
JUSTICE. 
AND THE SENATE NOW HAS THE 
CHANCE TO PROTECT THIS GLORIOUS 
HERITAGE BY SENDING JUDGE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH TO THE UNITED STATES 
SUPREME COURT. 
AND NOW JUDGE, THE PODIUM 
ISYOURS.  
   
>> THANK YOU.
>> MR.  PRESIDENT, THANK YOU.   
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, I HAVE 
WITNESSED FIRSTHAND YOUR 
APPRECIATION FOR THE VITAL ROLE 
OF THE AMERICAN JUDICIARY. 
NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER CONSULTED 
MORE WIDELY OR TALKED WITH MORE 
PEOPLE FOR MORE BACKGROUNDS TO 
SEEK INPUT ABOUT A SUPREME 
COURT NOMINATION. 
MR.  PRESIDENT, I AM GRATEFUL 
TO YOU, AND I'M HUMBLED BY YOUR 
CONFIDENCE IN ME. 
THANK YOU. 
30 YEARS AGO PRESIDENT REAGAN 
NOMINATED ANTHONY KENNEDY TO 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
THE FRAMERS ESTABLISHED THE 
CONSTITUTION IS DESIGNED TO 
SECURE THE BLESSINGS OF 
LIBERTY. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY DEVOTED HIS 
CAREER TO SECURING LIBERTY. 
I AM DEEPLY HONORED TO BE 
NOMINATED TO FILL HIS SEAT ON 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
    MY MOM AND DAD 
ARE HERE. 
I AM THEIR ONLY CHILD. 
WHEN PEOPLE ASK WHAT IT IS LIKE 
TO BE AN ONLY CHILD, I SAY IT 
DEPENDS ON WHO YOUR PARENTS 
ARE. 
I WAS LUCKY. 
MY MOM WAS A TEACHER. 
IN THE 1960s AND 70s, SHE 
TAUGHT HISTORY AT TWO LARGELY 
AFRICAN AMERICAN PUBLIC HIGH 
SCHOOLS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. 
MCKINLEY TECH AND H.D. 
WOODSON. 
HER EXAMPLE TAUGHT ME THE 
IMPORTANCE OF EQUALITY FOR ALL 
AMERICANS. 
MY MOM WAS A TRAIL BLAZER. 
WHEN I WAS TEN, SHE WENT TO LAW 
SCHOOL AND BECAME A PROSECUTOR. 
MY INTRODUCTION TO LAW CAME AT 
OUR DINNER TABLE. 
SHE PRACTICED HER CLOSING 
ARGUMENTS. 
HER TRADEMARK LINE WAS USE YOUR 
COMMON SENSE. 
WHAT RINGS TRUE, WHAT RINGS 
FALSE? 
THAT'S GOOD ADVICE FOR A JUROR 
AND FOR A SON. 
ONE OF THE FEW WOMEN 
PROSECUTORS OF THAT TIME SHE 
OVERCAME BARRIERS AND BECAME A 
TRIAL JUDGE. 
THE PRESIDENT INTRODUCED ME 
TONIGHT AS JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
BUT TO ME THAT TITLE WILL 
ALWAYS BELONG TO MY MOM. 
MY DAD WENT TO LAW SCHOOL AT 
NIGHT WHILE WORKING FULL TIME. 
HE HAS AN UNPARALLEL WORK 
ETHIC, AND PASSED DOWN TO ME 
HIS PASSION FOR PLAYING AND 
WATCHING SPORTS. 
I LOVE HIM DEARLY. 
THE MOTTO OF MY HIGH SCHOOL WAS 
MAN FOR OTHERS. 
I HAVE TRIED TO LIVE THAT 
CREED. 
I SPENT MY CAREER IN PUBLIC 
SERVICE FROM THE EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH AND THE WHITE HOUSE TO 
THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR 
THE D.C. CIRCUIT. 
I'VE SERVED WITH 17 OTHER 
JUDGES. 
EACH OF THEM A COLLEAGUE AND A 
FRIEND. 
MY JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY IS 
STRAIGHTFORWARD. 
A JUDGE MUST BE INDEPENDENT AND 
MUST INTERPRET THE LAW, NOT 
MAKE THE LAW. 
A JUDGE MUST INTERPRET STATUTES 
AS WRITTEN. 
AND A JUDGE MUST INTERPRET THE 
CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN, 
INFORMED BY HISTORY AND 
TRADITION AND PRECEDENT. 
FOR THE PAST 11 YEARS, I'VE 
TAUGHT HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS 
PRIMARILY AT HARVARD LAW 
SCHOOL. 
I TEACH THAT THE CONSTITUTION'S 
SEPARATION OF POWER PROTECTS 
INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY, AND REMAIN  
ME, JUSTICE KAGAN. 
AS A JUDGE, I HIRED FOUR LAW 
CLERKS EACH YEAR. 
I LOOK FOR THE BEST. 
MY LAW CLERKS COME FROM DIVERSE 
BACKGROUNDS AND POINTS OF VIEW. 
I AM PROUD THAT A MAJORITY OF 
MY LAW CLERKS HAVE BEEN WOMEN. 
I AM PART OF THE VIBRANT 
CATHOLIC COMMUNITY IN THE D.C. 
AREA. 
THE MEMBERS OF THAT COMMUNITY 
DISAGREE ABOUT MANY THINGS, BUT 
WE ARE UNITED BY A COMMITMENT 
TO SERVE. 
FATHER JOHN INSLER IS HERE. 
40 YEARS AGO I WAS AN ALTAR BOY 
FOR FATHER JOHN. 
THESE DAYS I HELP HIM SERVE 
MEALS TO THE HOMELESS AT 
CATHOLIC CHARITIES. 
I HAVE TWO SPIRITED DAUGHTERS, 
MARGARET AND LISA. 
MARGARET LOVES SPORTS AND SHE 
LOVES TO READ. 
LIZA LOVES SPORTS AND SHE LOVES 
TO TALK. 
    
I HAVE TRIED TO CREATE BONDS 
WITH MY DAUGHTERS LIKE MY DAD 
CREATED WITH ME. 
FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS, I 
HAVE COACHED MY DAUGHTER'S 
BASKETBALL TEAMS. 
THE GIRLS ON THE TEAM CALL ME 
COACH K.   
    
I AM PROUD OF OUR BLESSED TEAM 
AND THEY WON THE CITY 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
  
(APPLAUSE)
MY DAUGHTERS AND I ALSO GO TO 
LOTS OF GAMES. 
OUR FAVORITE MEMORY WAS GOING 
TO THE HISTORIC NOTRE DAME 
UCONN WOMEN'S BASKETBALL GAME 
AT THIS YEAR'S FINAL FOUR. 
UNFORGETTABLE. 
MY WIFE, ASHLEY, IS A WEST 
TEXAN, A GRADUATE OF ABILENE 
COOPER PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL AND 
THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS. 
SHE IS NOW THE TOWN MANAGER OF 
OUR COMMUNITY. 
WE MET IN 2001 WHEN WE BOTH 
WORKED IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 
OUR FIRST DATE WAS ON SEPTEMBER 
10, 2001. 
THE NEXT MORNING I WAS A FEW 
STEPS BEHIND HER AS THE SECRET 
SERVICE SHOUTED AT ALL OF US TO 
SPRINT OUT THE FRONT GATES OF 
THE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE THERE 
WAS AN INBOUND PLANE. 
IN THE DIFFICULT WEEKS THAT 
FOLLOWED, ASHLEY WAS A SOURCE 
OF STRENGTH FOR PRESIDENT BUSH 
AND FOR EVERYONE IN THIS 
BUILDING. 
THROUGH BAD DAYS AND SO MANY 
BETTER DAYS SINCE THEN, SHE'S 
BEEN A GREAT WIFE AND AN 
INSPIRING MOM. 
I THANK GOD EVERY DAY FOR MY 
FAMILY. 
    
(APPLAUSE)
TOMORROW I BEGIN MEETING WITH 
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE, WHICH 
PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN THIS 
PROCESS. 
I WILL TELL EACH SENATOR THAT I 
REVERE THE CONSTITUTION. 
I BELIEVE THAT AN INDEPENDENT 
JUDICIARY IS THE CROWN JEWEL OF 
OUR CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC. 
IF CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE, I 
WILL KEEP AN OPEN MIND IN EVERY 
CASE, AND I WILL ALWAYS STRIVE 
TO PRESERVE THE CONSTITUTION OF 
THE UNITED STATES AND THE 
AMERICAN RULE OF LAW. 
THANK YOU, MR.  PRESIDENT. 
    
(APPLAUSE)
    
>> SO THERE YOU GO IT IS BRETT 
KAVANAUGH THERE WITH HIS TWO 
DAUGHTERS AND HIS WIFE AS HE 
WALKS AWAY FOLLOWING THE 
PRESIDENT AND BRETT KAVANAUGH 
LOOKING OUT AT HIS PARENTS IN 
THE AUDIENCE. 
ONE COULD ONLY IMAGINE WHAT'S 
GOING THROUGH THEIR MINDS AT A 
MOMENT LIKE THIS. 
JAN, AS WE WATCH EVERYTHING 
WRAP UP HERE, JAN CRAWFORD BACK 
WITH US NOW AS WELL AS MARGARET 
BRENNAN, WHAT DOES THIS PICK 
TELL YOU, JAN? 
>> WELL, I THINK THIS PICK 
SHOWS THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO 
IS NOT GOING TO PULL ANY 
PUNCHES. 
HE WAS GOING TO HAVE A FIGHT TO 
GET A NOMINEE THAT HE BELIEVED 
WAS GOING TO BE A CONSERVATIVE 
INTELLECTUAL FORCE ON THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
HE IS GOING TO TAKE THAT FIGHT 
RIGHT TO THE DEMOCRATS WHO 
CERTAINLY OPPOSED HIM FOR HIS 
APPELLATE COURT NOMINATION. 
>> BECAUSE KAVANAUGH HAS A 
RECORD AND THEY WILL HAVE TO GO 
THROUGH THAT. 
IT COULD BE THIS FIGHT NOW. 
>> ABSOLUTELY, BUT THE 
PRESIDENT IS SAYING I'M WILLING 
TO DO IT, I AM GOING TO MAKE 
THIS SUPREME COURT, I 
CAMPAIGNED ON THIS, AND I AM 
DELIVERING. 
THERE IS NO QUESTION, I MEAN 
WITH THIS NOMINATION, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP MAY WELL DO WHAT 
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE 
TRIED TO DO FOR 40 YEARS AND 
FAILED. 
AND THAT IS TO TURN THE SUPREME 
COURT INTO MORE CLEARLY SOLIDLY 
CONSERVATIVE DIRECTION AND AWAY 
FROM WHAT THEY SEE IS THE REAL 
EXCESSES. 
I EAN IT HAD IS A GENERATIONAL 
PICK THAT COULD AFFECT 
GENERATIONS TO COME. 
>> THERE WAS PRESSURE UNDER THE 
PRESIDENT, ON THE PRESIDENT TO 
MAYBE PLAY IT SAFE, TO GO WITH 
SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T HAVE A 
RECORD, WHO DIDN'T HAVE A PAPER 
TRAIL. 
I THINK WITH THIS PICK, HE SAYS 
NO, BRING IT. 
>> MARGARET, TALK ABOUT THE 
NOMINATION PROCESS AND WHAT'S 
AHEAD HERE? 
>> THERE IS VERY LITTLE 
DEMOCRATS COULD DO TO STOP THE 
SWING OF THE COURT AS JAN LAID 
OUT TOWARDS MORE CONSERVATIVE 
LEANINGS HERE. 
BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY 
IS SUCH A SLIM RAZOR-THIN 
MARGIN, REALLY ANY ONE SENATOR 
CROSSING OVER COULD MAKE OR 
BREAK THIS NOMINEE. 
AND SO THAT IS WHY THE 
POLITICKING OF THIS IS GOING TO 
GET GOING TOMORROW. 
HE VICE PRESIDENT WILL  
KAVANAUGH TO THE HILL, TAKE HIM 
AROUND, MAKE THE INTRODUCTIONS. 
THEY ARE GOING TO BE FOCUSING 
ON WINNING OVER SOME OF THESE 
RED STATE DEMOCRATS TO TRY TO 
GET THIS CONFIRMATION IN PLACE 
BY EARLY OCTOBER AHEAD OF THOSE 
CONGRESSIONAL RACES. 
IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE THE 
PRESIDENT EMBRACE SOMEONE WHO 
IS SO CLOSE TO THE BUSH FAMILY. 
WE ARE SEEING SUCH A WARM 
RECEPTION FROM THEM, FROM THE 
ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS FROM 
A PRESIDENT WHO PROMISED TO UP 
END THE ESTABLISHMENT WHEN HE 
CAME HERE. 
>> THE SUPREME COURT WILL BE 
HUGE TALKS ON THE CAMPAIGN 
TRAIL HERE BEFORE MIDTERMS 
COMING UP ON BOTH SIDES. 
MARGARET BRENNAN, JAN CRAWFORD, 
THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU. 
SO PRESIDENT TRUMP HERE 
NOMINATES BRETT KAVANAUGH TO BE 
THE 114th JUSTICE OF THE UNITED 
STATES SUPREME COURT. 
THERE WILL BE MUCH MORE ABOUT 
THIS ON YOUR LATE LOCAL NEWS ON 
THIS CBS STATION ON OUR 24-HOUR 
STREAMING NEWS SERVICE CBSN. 
FOR SOME OF YOU IN THE WEST ON 
THE CBS EVENING NEWS, ALSO 
TOMORROW, CBS THIS MORNING WILL 
HAVE THE ONLY NETWORK INTERVIEW 
WITH SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADER, 
CHUCK SCHUMER, REACTING TO THIS 
NOMINATION. 
FOR NOW I'M JEFF GLOR. 
CBS NEWS IN WASHINGTON, FOR 
MANY OF YOU CBS PRIME TIME 
PROGRAMMING WILL CONTINUE IN 
JUST A MOMENT.  
>>> HI EVERYONE, I'M ELIZABETH 
PALMER. 
WELCOME  E -- I'M ELAINE 
QUIJANO. 
BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN 
NOMINATED TO THE HIGHEST COURT 
IN THE LAND. 
THE 53-YEAR-OLD IS CURRENTLY A 
CONSERVATIVE FEDERAL APPEAL'S 
JUDGE. 
KAVANAUGH WILL REQUIRE SENATE 
CONFIRMATION BEFORE HE IS ABLE 
TO TAKE HIS SEAT ON THE BENCH. 
EARLIER THE PRESIDENT SAID HE 
WAS CONFIDENT ABOUT HIS 
NOMINEE. 
>> WHAT MATTERS IS NOT A 
JUDGE'S POLITICAL VIEWS, BUT 
WHETHER THEY CAN SET ASIDE 
THOSE VIEWS TO DO WHAT THE LAW 
AND THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRE. 
I AM PLEASED TO SAY THAT I HAVE 
FOUND WITHOUT DOUBT SUCH A 
PERSON. 
TONIGHT IT IS MY HONOR AND 
PRIVILEGE TO ANNOUNCE THAT I 
WILL NOMINATE JUDGE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH TO THE UNITED STATES 
SUPREME COURT. 
>> ELLIOTT IS A SENIOR FELLOW 
AT THE INSTITUTE. 
FIRST OF ALL WHAT IS YOUR TAKE 
ON THE SELECTION OF JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH? 
>> WELL HE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE 
THE FRONT RUNNER THE WHOLE 
TIME. 
HE HAD ESSENTIALLY THE INSIDE 
THE BELTWAY LEGAL LEADS, 
CONSERVATIVE LEGAL LEADS BEHIND 
HIM. 
HIS CLERKS WERE OUT IN FORCE. 
AND IT WORKED. 
HE WAS THE FAVORITE OF DON 
MCGAHN, THE WHITE HOUSE 
COUNCIL. 
A LEADING CANDIDATE ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH, DID NOT MAKE THE FIRST 
LIST TRUMP PUT OUT OR THE 
SECOND ONE WHEN HE WAS ADDED IN 
NOVEMBER, BUT CERTAINLY VERY 
STRONG REPUTATION FOR 
CONSERVATIVE, STRUCTURAL, 
ORIGINALIST OPINIONS FORCING 
THE SEPARATIONS OF POWERS, 
PUSHING BACK ON THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, MEANING ON 
EXECUTIVE AGENCIES. 
THAT IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE 
AAA, THE SECOND MOST 
PRESTIGIOUS COURT IN THE LAND 
HANDLING APPEALS. 
>> WELL ILYA, WHAT DO WE KNOW 
ABOUT THIS NOW, WHAT WE ASSUME 
TO BE A CONFIRMATION FIGHT THAT 
WILL BE A DIFFICULT FIGHT. 
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIS 
PARTICULAR JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY 
BASED ON THE DECISIONS HE HAS 
MADE SO FAR THAT COULD BE A 
FOCAL POINT FOR DEMOCRATS? 
>> WELL BOTH HIS DECISIONS AND 
SPEECHES IN WRITINGS. 
HE PUBLISHES AN HOUR OF ONE 
ARTICLE A YEAR AND HE DOES HAVE 
A BIG PUBLIC PROFILE. 
THAT'S A PART OF THE REASON WHY 
HE HAS ATTRACTED A BIG 
FOLLOWING.    
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYTHING IS 
NECESSARILY GOING TO ATTACK 
SMEARS, ATTACKS WHAT HAVE YOU. 
HOWEVER WHO WAS GOING TO BE 
THERE WOULD BE A BIG OPPOSITION 
AS THEY HAD THOSE SIGNS 
PROTESTING OUTSIDE THE SUPREME 
COURT WITH A BLANK SPACE, BUT 
THEY ARE NOW ALL TRYING TO 
WRITE ON KAVANAUGH.    
BUT PROBABLY HIS SERVICE IN THE 
BUSH WHITE HOUSE WILL ATTRACT 
MORE OF HIS OPINIONS. 
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY FOUR SQUARE 
CULTURE WAR OPINIONS ON GAY 
MARRIAGE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. 
ON GUNS, HE WAS PRETTY STRONG 
IN DEFENDING THE RIGHT TO KEEP 
BARE ARMS, BUT NOT ANYTHING 
CRAZY LIKE APPROVING MACHINE 
GUNS OR HAVING NO RESTRICTIONS 
WHATSOEVER. 
HE WILL BE QUESTIONED ON LOTS 
OF THINGS. 
ESPECIALLY ROE V. WADE SEEMS TO 
BE BROUGHT UP EVEN MORE THAN IT 
HAS BEEN IN THE PAST. 
LOOK FOR THAT AT HIS HEARINGS.  
BUT YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T HAVE 
ANY RED FLAGS THAT WAY. 
I DOUBT HE'S THE SORT OF PERSON 
THAT SUSAN COLLINS, THE FOCAL 
POINT WOULD OBJECT TO. 
THAT MEANS EVEN THOUGH THE 
REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IS NARROW, 
VERY NARROW, GIVEN NO 
FILIBUSTER, HE SHOULD BE 
CONFIRMED. 
>> REMIND US THOUGH, THERE HAVE 
BEEN SOME CONSERVATIVES WHO 
FELT BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS NOT 
SUFFICIENTLY CONSERVATIVE, THAT 
HE WASN'T CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH. 
WHY WAS THAT? 
WHAT WAS THEIR ARGUMENT? 
>> WELL, I SHARE A CERTAIN 
CONCERN THAT HE'S TOO MUCH LIKE 
JOHN ROBERTS, NOT ENOUGH LIKE A 
GORSUCH OR A THOMAS, WHICH 
ISN'T TO SAY HE'S A SECRET LEFT 
WINGER OR A SQUISHY MODERATE. 
NOTHING LIKE THAT. 
BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT VIEWS. 
NOT JUST OF ORIGINALISM OR 
TEXTURALLISM, BUT THE PROPER 
MODE OF THE JUDGE, THE PROPER 
ROLE OF A JUDGE. 
HOW RESTRAINED ARE YOU. 
DO YOU TRY TO MAKE NARROW 
DECISIONS OR BROADER ONES? 
AND KAVANAUGH HAS A REPUTATION 
FOR BEING VERY SHREWD IN TERMS 
OF HOW HE IS DECIDING THESE 
CASES. 
NOT NECESSARILY WITHIN AN 
AGENDA TO OVERRULE LARGE SWATHS 
OF PRECEDENT. 
I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE ENOUGH 
FOR CONSERVATIVES TO COME OUT 
AND START ATTACKING HIM OR 
LIBERTARIANS, POP EWE POPULIST. 
SO I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE 
MORE ATTACKS FROM THE LEFT. 
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYBODY, 
ALL CONSERVATIVES OR 
REPUBLICANS, TRUMP SUPPORTERS, 
THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOING 
TO BE ECSTATIC WITH HIM. 
DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAD DIFFERENT 
FAVORITES, BUT I DON'T THINK 
HE'LL RAISE THE KIND OF RED 
FLAGS THAT HAPPEN UNDER SAY 
HARRIET MEYERS WHILE WITHDRAWN 
OR OTHER PEOPLE CRITICIZED 
HARSHLY. 
>> YOU MENTIONED IN SPEAKING OF 
BRETT KAVANAUGH, IT HAD TERM 
BEING A TECH TECH -- 
TEXTURALLIST? 
YOU DON'T TRY TO FIGURE OUT 
WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE INTENDED 
TO DO BY LOOKING AT COMMITTEE 
REPORTS, THE REAL PURPOSE IS TO 
DO X, SO WE CAN'T HAVE Y GOING 
AGAINST X. IF THE LAW SAYS 
THAT, I WILL APPLY THAT, EVEN 
IF IT RESULTS IN A RESULT THAT 
MIGHT NOT LOOK FAIR OR MIGHT 
NOT LOOK GOOD BECAUSE THAT'S 
NOT THE ROLE OF A JUDGE TO 
CORRECT. 
THAT'S THE ROLE OF A 
LEGISLATOR. 
CERTAINLY TEXTURISM APPLIED TO 
THE CONSTITUTION. 
BUT YOU'RE INTERPRETING A 200-
YEAR-OLD DOCUMENT RATHER THAN A 
LAW. 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT DICTIONARIES 
FROM THE LATE 18th CENTURIES, 
NEWSPAPERS, TRYING TO 
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TEXT OF THE 
CONSTITUTION, WHAT ITS ORIGINAL 
PUBLIC MEANING IS. 
WHERE HE STANDS IN THE NEW 
COURT, HE WILL CERTAINLY BE TO 
THE RIGHT COMFORTABLY ON THE 
RIGHT SOMEWHERE. 
I CAN'T EXACTLY SAY ON 
DIFFERENT ISSUES, WHETHER 
CLOSER TO THOMAS OR GORSUCH, 
BUT TO THE RIGHT OF JOHN 
ROBERTS, WHO WILL NOW 
DEFINITIVELY BECOME THE MEDIAN 
VOTE. 
NOT THE SWING VOTE, HE'S NOT 
GOING TO GO BACK AND FORTH, BUT 
HE WILL DETERMINE EXACTLY HOW 
FAST AND WHERE THE COURT WILL 
GO WHETHER ON HUGE 
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES OR OTHER 
ONES THAT DON'T MAKE THE FRONT 
PAGES. 
>> OF COURSE, KAVANAUGH IS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATION 
FOLLOWING NOW JUSTICE NEIL 
GORSUCH. 
WHERE ARE THERE SIMILARITIES 
AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 
TWO? 
>> WELL THEY HAVE BOTH BEEN 
INVOLVED WITH THE FEDERAL 
SOCIETY. 
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING JOHN 
ROBERTS WAS A PART OF.    
MEANING THAT FROM A VERY YOUNG 
AGE FROM LAW SCHOOL OR A YOUNG 
LEGAL CAREER AGE, THEY ARE 
AWARE OF THIS NETWORK OF 
CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERTARIAN 
LAWYERS AND LAW STUDENTS WHO 
ARE OUT TO CHANGE THE LEGAL 
CULTURE. 
LAWYERS BEING PERCEIVED TO BE 
ON THE LEFT IN VARIOUS WAYS. 
HE IS INTELLECTUALLY STEEP IN 
THE LAW. 
HE IS KNOWN TO AGREE WITH HIM 
OR NOT AS BEING BRILLIANT, 
WRITING OPINIONS THAT ARE OFTEN 
CITED BY THE SUPREME COURT, BY 
ADVOCATES. 
HE IS ONE OF THESE LOWER COURT 
JUDGES THAT HAS PRESIDENTIAL 
AUTHORITY, PERSUASIVE 
PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY BEYOND 
SIMPLY HIS CORRIDOR, DIRECTLY 
BELOW HIM IN D.C. AND SO AGAIN, 
THIS IS NOT SOMEONE THAT'S A 
CIPHER OR THAT HAS COME OUT OF 
THE WOODWORK, A SURPRISE. 
IT IS VERY WELL KNOWN AMONG 
THOSE WHO FOLLOW LEGAL 
DEVELOPMENTS.    
YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE WON'T EXCITE 
THE BASE AS MUCH AS CERTAIN 
OTHER PEOPLE THAT WERE BEING 
CONSIDERED, BUT AT THE SAME 
TIME THAT MEANS HE DOESN'T HAVE 
QUITE AS MUCH OPPOSITION, YOU 
KNOW, THEY WILL BE GRASPING AT 
CERTAIN THINGS. 
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TRACTION 
THAT'S GOING TO GET IN THE 
PUBLIC DISCOURSE. 
>> GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT 
BRETT KAVANAUGH, IS IT LIKELY 
OR EVEN POSSIBLE THAT IF, IN 
FACT, THE ISSUE OF UPHOLDING OR 
TURNING ROE V. WADE WERE TO 
COME, HE WOULD VOTE TO OVERTURN 
IT? 
>> I DON'T THINK SO. 
THAT ISSUE, IT WOULD BE STRANGE 
TO HAVE A CASE. 
BUT TYPICALLY YOU WOULD HAVE 
VARIOUS RESIXTHS, FACING THEM 
EVERY FIVE YEARS OR SO. 
WHAT YOU'LL SEE ESPECIALLY AS I 
MENTIONED TO BE LED BY THE 
CHIEF JUSTICE, THE MEDIAN VOTE 
THAT YOU'LL SEE SOME OF THESE 
RESTRICTIONS STARTING TO BE 
WITHHELD WITHOUT NEEDING TO 
TOUCH ROE V. WADE OR PLANTED 
PARENTHOOD VERSES CASEY. 
WE TALK ABOUT ROE, BUT CASEY, 
THE 1992 CASE THAT KENNEDY 
ENGINEERED AND AUTHORED PUT IN 
THIS UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD. 
WHAT GETS THROUGH OR WHAT 
SURVIVES AN UNDUE BURDEN 
STANDARD, I THINK NOW IT WILL 
EXPAND. 
BUT I THINK WE ARE GENERALLY 
FAR OFF FROM OVERTURNING ROE 
ALTOGETHER. 
OTHER AREAS OF LAW, IT JUST 
DEPENDS. 
ALL THIS FOCUS ON ABORTION. 
BUT FOR EXAMPLE, RACIAL 
PREFERENCES IN EDUCATION 
ADMISSIONS. 
THAT'S ONE AREA WHERE I COULD 
SEE CAVANAUGH BEING THE 
DEFINITIVE VOTE, SAYING THEY 
VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION TO GET 
RID OF THAT ALTOGETHER. 
>> ALL RIGHT, JOINING US FROM 
WASHINGTON. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR 
PERSPECTIVE. 
>>> ALL RIGHT, TO DISCUSS SOME 
OF THE POLITICAL REACTION TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ANNOUNCEMENT, 
I WANT TO BRING BACK OUR PANEL 
OF LESLIE SANCHEZ, CAITLIN HUEY-
BURNS, AND JILL PAYNE IN 
WASHINGTON. 
LET ME FIRST OF ALL GO TO YOU, 
LESLIE. 
THIS IS AN OBVIOUS CHOICE, SOME 
ARE SAYING BECAUSE FOR A 
PRESIDENT WHO HAS MADE IT A 
POINT TO TRY TO KEEP HIS 
PROMISES TO THE CONSERVATIVE 
ELEMENTS OF HIS BASE. 
PLEASE THE INITIAL REACTION, A 
LOT OF THOSE CONSERVATIVES. 
>> VERY BIG STROKES IN TERMS OF 
ESTABLISHING SUPPORT AMONG BASE 
REPUBLICANS, ESTABLISHMENT 
REPUBLICANS, CONSERVATIVES, A 
BIT OF A WAY STATION FOR THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN TALKED 
ABOUT, A PART OF THE FEDERALIST 
SOCIETY, WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT 
EARLIER. 
IT IS REALLY AN INCUBATOR FOR 
TRAINING, CREDENTIALING, A NEW 
GENERATION OF YOUNG JURORRISTS 
THAT COULD GO -- JURIST AND 
LEAVE THE COURT. 
HE HAS BEEN IN THE PIPELINE FOR 
A VERY LONG TIME. 
THERE IS ONE THING THAT I DO 
POINT UP. 
HE WAS A BIG ARCHITECT AND 
WRITER IN THE STAR REPORT AND 
OUTLINED 11 GROUNDS FOR CLINTON 
IMPEACHMENT, WHICH COULD BE 
AWKWARD LATER. 
BUT DEPENDING ON HOW THINGS 
COME OUT IN CONGRESS A FEW 
YEARS FROM NOW. 
BUT IT IS DEFINITELY SOMEONE 
WHO HAS A WIDE RANGE OF 
EXPERIENCE THAT REPUBLICANS ARE 
GOING TO FACE. 
>> CAITLIN, WHAT ARE SOME OF 
THE CHALLENGES YOU THINK 
KAVANAUGH WILL FACE IN A 
CONFIRMATION PROCESS? 
>> WELL, AS WE HAVE SEEN, 
KAVANAUGH IS ONE OF THE MORE 
EXPERIENCED MEMBERS OF THOSE 
WHO WERE TALKED ABOUT. 
BUT THAT ALSO MEANS HE HAS A 
LONG PAPER TRAIL. 
HE ALSO WORKED IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
OF COURSE, THE BUSH WHITE 
HOUSE. 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO 
THROUGH LOTS AND LOTS OF 
DOCUMENTS AND PAPERS AND 
WRITINGS AND EXCHANGES AND 
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THIS 
PERSON HAS SAID. 
SO THERE IS A LOT FOR PEOPLE TO 
KIND OF GO THROUGH AND DIGEST. 
YOU ARE ALREADY HERING CHUCK 
SCHUMER KIND OF -- ALREADY WITH 
CHUCK SCHUMER KIND OF SAYING HE 
IS GOING TO FIGHT THIS AS MUCH 
AS HE CAN. 
YOU DO SEE REPUBLICANS REALLY 
SATISFIED WITH THIS PICK. 
IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHAT 
THOSE TWO REPUBLICAN SENATORS 
THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT, 
MURKOWSKI AND COLLINS, WHETHER 
THIS IS A PICK THAT IS MORE 
MAINSTREAM IN TERMS OF WHAT 
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR. 
THAT COULD BE A FACTOR HERE. 
ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER TOO 
IS THAT BECAUSE HE WAS INVOLVED 
IN THE STAR DECISION, HE HAS 
ALSO MADE COMMENTS DURING THAT, 
THAT A PRESIDENT SHOULDN'T BE, 
YOU KNOW, HAVE TO BE INVOLVED 
IN -- HE HAS PRESIDENTIAL 
POWERS THAT COULD INOCULATE HIM 
FROM THESE INVESTIGATIONS, 
WHICH I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO 
HEAR QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT 
PARTICULARLY FROM SENATORS LIKE 
CORY BOOKER WHO SAID WE 
SHOULDN'T CONSIDER THE 
PRESIDENT'S PICK UNTIL THE 
MUELLER INVESTIGATION WRAPS UP. 
NOT THAT IT IS REALISTIC, BUT I 
THINK IT WILL BE ALONG THE 
LINES OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO 
HEAR. 
>> YEAH, WHAT ABOUT THAT? 
THE NOTION THAT YOU DO HAVE 
QUITE THE RECORD HERE FOR 
DEMOCRATS WHO ARE GOING TO TRY 
TO SLOW DOWN PRESUMABLY THIS 
CONFIRMATION PROCESS. 
THEY HAVE A LOT TO GO THROUGH.  
>> THEY DO HAVE A LOT TO GO 
THROUGH. 
THERE IS QUITE THE PAPER TRAIL 
ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU'RE ALREADY 
SAYING, DEMOCRATS ARE WASTING 
NO TIME IN LAYING OUT THE 
MARKERS HERE. 
CHUCK SCHUMER'S STATEMENT WAS 
OUT ABOUT TEN SECONDS AFTER 
DONALD TRUMP SAID BRETT 
AND HE WAS VERY CLEAR WHAT THE %
MARKER WAS GOING TO BE. 
IT WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT 
WOMEN'S HEALTH, IT WAS GOING TO 
BE ABOUT HEALTH CARE, IT IS 
GOING TO BE ABOUT EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE. 
I THINK ALSO SOMETHING 
DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO PUSH ON 
HERE, THEY ARE GOING TO TALK 
ABOUT A RECENT OPINION THAT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WROTE ABOUT A 
YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS HELD AT THE 
BORDER FROM A MIGRANT FAMILY 
AND RIGHTS INVOLVING THAT. 
I THINK THERE IS A LOT HERE FOR 
DEMOCRATS TO PICK THROUGH. 
I WILL SAY THIS, THE PRESIDENT 
COULD HAVE GONE FOR A FULL-ON 
CULTURE WAR, PICKING SOMEONE 
LIKE AMY CONEY BARRETT, THAT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN SIGNALING 
YOU'RE READY TO FIGHT. 
THIS SIGNALS I'M READY TO 
FIGHT, BUT I'M TRYING TO BE 
GOVERNOR HERE. 
THAT'S INTERESTING, AN 
INTERESTING SIGNALING TO SENATE 
REPUBLICANS. 
MITCH MCCONNELL IS NOT AS HAPPY 
AS HE COULD BE WITH THIS 
CHOICE, BUT HE IS HAPPIER THAN 
SOMEONE LIKE AMY CONEY BARRETT. 
>> THE NOTION THAT AS JOE 
POINTS OUT, THE POTENTIAL FROM 
A STRATEGIC POINT OF VIEW TO 
SORT OF ADD FUEL TO THIS 
ALREADY VERY, VERY HEATED 
CULTURE WAR THAT HAS BEEN 
TAKING PLACE. 
SO IN SOME RESPECT, SOME 
REPUBLICANS MUST BE BREATHING A 
SIGH OF RELIEF? 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS 
REALLY GIVEN A PASS TO 
REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE BY 
HANDING THEM A LONG-TIME 
WASHINGTON INSIDER, WHICH IS IN 
SOME WAYS IN CONTRACT TO HIS 
CAMPAIGN. 
REALLY, I THINK YOU SHOULDN'T 
DO A CONSERVE, BATTLE AT THE 
TIME YOU PICKED REPUBLICNS, 
POTENTIALLY NOT HAVING ENOUGH 
VOTES TO CONFIRM SOMEONE WHO 
PERHAPS WOULD BE MORE OF A 
CONTROVERSIAL PICK. 
SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO CAUSE A 
HUGE DEBATE, FOR EXAMPLE, OVER 
ROE V. WADE. 
THERE ISN'T MUCH OF A PAPER 
TRAIL AS WE HAVE SAID ON ROE V. 
WADE. 
FOR SOMEONE LIKE KAVANAUGH, HE 
SAID IN THE PAST HE CONSIDERS 
IT BINDING PRECEDENT. 
BUT THAT'S WHEN HE WAS BEING 
CONSIDERED FOR THE CIRCUIT 
COURT OF APPEALS. 
YOU TO FOLLOW THE PRECEDENCE 
SET BY THE SUPREME COURT. 
HE IS SUPPORTED BY THE BUSINESS 
COMMUNITY AS WELL. 
HE IS OFFERING OPINIONS RAINING 
IN SOME OF THE OBAMA ERA IN THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, 
GOING AFTER THE CONSUMER 
PROTECTION BUREAU, COMING OUT. 
AND I THINK HE IS SOMEONE THAT 
A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WOULD FEEL 
AS IF FAIRLY IT IS A SAFE PICK. 
OF COURSE, AS WE SAID, WE WILL 
SEE WHAT ISSUES DEMOCRATS WILL 
HIGHLIGHT. 
I DO THINK THEY WILL NEED TO GO 
OVER THIS IDEA THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS ABSOLUTE 
DISCRETION WHEN IT COMES TO 
WHETHER OR NOT THEY NEED TO 
APPOINT OR FIRE A SPECIAL 
COUNCIL WITH ALL THE ATTENTION 
INTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND 
MOSCOW. 
THAT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE ISSUES 
THAT THEY WILL NEED TO SHOW 
YOU. 
>> AND THEY WANT TO PLACE WHAT 
THEY HAVE SAID ABOUT HIS 
JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY. 
LET'S LISTEN TO THAT.   
>> I HAVE SERVED WITH 17 OTHER 
JUDGES. 
EACH OF THEM A COLLEAGUE AND A 
FRIEND. 
IT IS STRAIGHTFORWARD. 
A JUDGE MUST BE INDEPENDENT AND 
MUST INTERPRET THE LAW NOT MAKE 
THE LAW.    
A JUDGE MUST INTERPRET STATUTES 
AS WRITTEN. 
AND A JUDGE MUST INTERPRET THE 
CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN. 
INFORMED BY HISTORY AND 
TRADITION AND PRECEDENT. 
>> LESLIE, IF YOU ARE MITCH 
MCCONNELL NOW AND YOU'RE 
THINKING ABOUT A CONFIRMATION 
PROCESS AND YOU LOOK AT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, WHAT ARE YOU 
THINKING RIGHT NOW? 
>> HE WASN'T ONE OF THE TOP TWO 
THAT WOULD BE THE SAFEST PICKS 
OVERALL. 
NOW YOU HAVE OVER 300 OPINIONS. 
THAT IS A LOT OF WORK AND DEPTH 
TO THIS IN TERMS OF NAVIGATING 
IT THROUGH THE SENATE. 
BUT I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY 
POSITIVE. 
HE KNOWS HOW TO DO THIS. 
HE HAS HANDLED THESE POLITICAL 
BATTLES BEFORE. 
HE IS EXACTLY THE RIGHT, HE HAS 
THE RIGHT CALIBER AND ENOUGH ON 
THE POSITIVES TO NAVIGATE SOME 
OF THESE NEGATIVES THAT YOU'RE 
GOING TO SEE. 
THOSE NEGATIVES THOUGH, SOME OF 
THE AMNESTY STORIES WE WILL 
HEAR ABOUT, YOU KNOW, SOME OF 
THESE HOT ISSUES. 
>> WHAT ABOUT THAT CAITLIN. 
WE KNOW MCCONNELL HAS SORT OF 
BEEN MASTERED. 
WE KNOW THAT FORMER SENATORS 
WILL BE THE SHERPA NOW GUIDING 
BRETT KAVANAUGH THROUGH THAT 
CONFIRMATION PROCESS AND 
MEETING WITH LAWMAKERS, FOR 
INSTANCE, ON CAPITOL HILL. 
BUT WHEN YOU ARE CONSIDERING 
STATEMENTS LIKE THOSE FROM 
SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS OR LISA 
MURKOWSKI, WITH THIS PICK OF 
BRETT KAVANAUGH, ARE YOU 
FEELING A LITTLE BIT BETTER NOW 
IF YOU ARE MITCH MCCONNELL? 
>> IF YOU ARE MITCH MCCONNELL, 
I THINK SO, ALTHOUGH THERE IS 
THAT UNCERTAINTY OF WHAT YOU 
CAN PICK APART FROM THOSE 
HUNDREDS OF DECISIONS, 
EVERYTHING ESSENTIALLY THAT HE 
HAS WRITTEN WHILE ON THE BENCH. 
SO SINCE THERE IS A LOT TO GO 
TO, I THINK UNCERTAINTY IS 
STILL THERE. 
HOWEVER WITH THIS PICK 
ESPECIALLY OPPOSED TO, YOU 
KNOW, ANITA KUMAR, OR -- AMY 
CONEY BARRETT OR MAYBE SOME 
OTHERS, THIS IS MORE OF AN 
ESTABLISHMENT-ORIENTED PICK.  
SO I THINK ANOTHER THING YOU 
HAVE TO CONSIDER IS THAT WHILE 
REPUBLICANS DO HAVE REAL 
DISAGREEMENTS WITH THIS 
PRESIDENT ON ISSUES LIKE TRADE, 
BUT ALSO ON HIS BEHAVIOR, HIS 
STYLE, AND HIS RHETORIC, THEY 
ARE REPUBLICANS AT THE END OF 
THE DAY.  
YOU KNOW, JEFF FLAKE IS A GOOD 
EXAMPLE OF THIS AND SOME 
OTHERS. 
úTHEY EVENTUALLY DO WAN 
TO YES ON THIS PICK BECAUSE 
THIS PICK, IT IS ESPECIALLY IN 
CAVANAUGH SEEN AS KIND OF A 
TRADITIONAL CONSERVATIVE PICK. 
SO I THINK THAT IS ALSO HOW WE 
NEED TO LOOK AT THIS. 
THAT IS WHY A LOT OF THESE 
DEMOCRATS WILL BE WAITING TO 
SEE WHAT THESE REPUBLICANS DO. 
IF REPUBLICANS COULD KEEP 
TOGETHER AS A COHESIVE UNIT AND 
VOTE IN SUPPORT OF CAVANAUGH, 
THEN YOU MIGHT SEE THAT GIVE 
LICENSE TO A COUPLE OF 
DEMOCRATS TO CROSS OVER.    
AND IF THEY DON'T DO THAT, THEN 
I THINK THAT WILL ALSO WORK TO 
THEIR ADVANTAGE. 
>> I WANT TO PUT UP A TWEET 
FROM A DEMOCRAT, SENATOR DOUG 
JONES. 
THIS IS THE STATEMENT FROM THE 
SENATOR THERE FROM ALABAMA. 
TONIGHT'S ANNOUNCEMENT IS ONLY 
A FIRST STEP, A AUTHOR 
REVETTING OF HIS BODY OF WORK 
WILL BE CRITICAL FOR THE SENATE 
TO FULFILL THE SHARE 
RESPONSIBILITY, WHICH I TAKE 
VERY SERIOUSLY. 
AND I WILL BE DILIGENT IN 
MEASURING THE RECORD AND 
UNDERTAKING THE INDEPENDENT 
REVIEW. 
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THROUGHOUT 
THE NIGHT, THE NOTION OF 
DEMOCRATS WHO FIND THEMSELVES 
IN THESE POSITIONS WHERE THEY 
ARE IN THESE RED STATES, BUT 
REALLY WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON 
HEIDI HEITKAMP AND JOE 
DONNELLY. 
JOE MANCHIN, I HAVEN'T YET SEEN 
WHAT KIND OF STATEMENTS THEY 
HAVE PUT OUT, BUT WE KNOW THEY 
HAVE DECLINED THAT INVITATION 
TO BE THERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. 
NOW WITH THIS PICK OF BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND SO MUCH OF A 
RECORD TO GO THROUGH, IS THERE 
NOW PERHAPS HOPE THEY WILL BE 
ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING WITHIN 
THAT RECORD THAT THEY WILL BE 
ABLE TO TEASE OUT ON THE 
ISSUES, MAYBE HANG A POSITION 
OF OPPOSITION, SO THEY WOULD BE 
ABLE TO SAY WHEN IT COMES TO, 
FOR INSTANCE, JOE MANCHIN, IN A 
PREEXISTING CONDITION, RIGHT, 
THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE. 
SOME OF THE RULINGS THAT THEY 
HAVE SEEN WOULD GIVE HIM PAUSE, 
SO THEY HAVE A MESSAGE THAT, 
YOU KNOW, RED STATE, EVEN AS A 
DEMOCRAT, THEY FEEL THEY WILL 
BE ABLE TO STILL CONNECT WITH 
VOTERS. 
>> I THINK QUITE POSSIBLY A LOT 
OF IT IS GOING TO HAVE TO DO 
MORE WITH THE WORKERS' RIGHTS, 
HEALTH CARE, SOME OF THOSE 
ECONOMIC ISSUES FOR DEMOCRATS 
WHO ARE IN RED STATES. 
THEY WILL NOT WIN THE PUBLIC 
ISSUES. 
I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT MIGHT 
BE THE DIFFERENCING IMEMPLOYED 
BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 
BECAUSE HE IS SOMEONE WHO 
SERVED WITHIN THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION, THERE MIGHT BE 
PERHAPS REIT GAITING OF THE 
ERA, THE POST SEVEN ERROR, THE 
QUESTION OF THE ROLE TO WHAT 
EXTENT WAS HE INVOLVED WITH, 
PERHAPS DEFENDING THE 
NOMINATION AT THE TIME. 
THAT CAME UP TO THE JUDICIARY. 
YOU KNOW, WHETHER OR NOT THAT A 
LOT OF THOSE SAME ISSUES WILL 
BE REIT GAITED NOW REMAINS TO 
BE SEEN. 
BUT I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS 
HE IS SOLIDLY CONSERVATIVE. 
SOME OF THE LEGAL SCHOLARS AND 
POLITICAL SCIENTISTS WHO KEEP A 
SCORE OF THOSE WHO SIT IN THE 
JUDICIARY HAVE THEY WOULD FALL 
WELL TO THE RIGHT OF ANTHONY 
KENNEDY.  
HE WOULD BE A CONSERVATIVE 
SECOND TO JUSTICE CLEARANCE 
THOMAS. 
SO I THINK THAT HE HAS A 
FUNDAMENTALLY CONSERVATIVE 
RECORD, WHERE DEMOCRATS WILL BE 
ABLE TO TEASE OUT SOMETHING IF 
THEY WANT TO STAND IN 
OPPOSITION. 
PERHAPS THERE IS A LITTLE BIT 
LESS PRESSURE ON DEMOCRATS IF 
THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY ARE 
THE DECISIVE VOICE. 
BRETT KAVANAUGH SEEMS LESS OF A 
CONTROVERSIAL PICK. 
GIVING A LITTLE BIT OF COVER TO 
THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO DON'T WANT 
TO BE SEEN AS THE DECIDING 
VOTE. 
>> AS YOU HAVE BEEN SPEAKING, I 
HAVE BEEN HANDED A STATEMENT 
HERE FROM JOE MANCHIN, DEMOCRAT 
OF WEST VIRGINIA. 
IT READS IN PART, , I HAVE A 
CONSTITUTION OBLIGATION TO 
FULFILL SUPREME COURT 
VACANCIES. 
I TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY 
SERIOUSLY. 
IT GOES ON TO SAY THE SUPREME 
COURT WILL ULTIMATELY DECIDE IF 
NEARLY00,000 WEST VIRGINIANS 
WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS 
WILL LOSE THEIR HEALTH CARE. 
THIS DECISION WILL DIRECTLY 
IMPACT ALMOST 40% OF MY STATE, 
SO I'M VERY INTERESTED IN HIS 
POSITION ON PROTECTING WEST 
VIRGINIA'S PREEXISTING 
CONDITIONS. 
SO JOEL, THE QUESTION TO YOU 
NOW IS WE ARE ALREADY SEEING, 
WHAT WOULD SEEM LIKE THE 
FORMULATION OF A STRATEGY FOR 
THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO ARE IN 
THOSE RED STATES AS THEY TRY TO 
FIGURE OUT HOW IT IS THEY WILL 
APPROACH THIS PARTICULAR 
NOMINATION. 
>> HARD IS THE SAFE GROUND FOR 
JOE MANCHIN TO BE ON. 
THAT'S WHERE THIS IS GOING TO 
BE. 
I DO THINK YOU ARE STILL GOING 
TO SEE PEOPLE LIKE JOE MANCHIN 
WAIT. 
THEY ARE GOING TO WAIT TO SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS WITH SUSAN COLLINS 
AND LISA MURKOWSKI. 
THAT'S THE GROUND THEY FEEL 
SAFE ON PUSHING BACK. 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR JOE 
MANCHIN TALKING ABOUT A WOMAN'S 
RIGHT. 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR HIM 
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER 
ISSUES THAT DON'T MATTER TO HIS 
STATE. 
HE IS SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS 
HOME STATE POLITICS BETTER THAN 
ANYONE IN THE DEMOCRATIC 
CAUCUS. 
úTHAT'S WHAT HE WILL DO 
ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUOTES I 
HAVE HEARD TONIGHT, ELAINE, AN 
OLD QUOTE FROM DICK DURBIN WHO 
CALLED BRETT KAVANAUGH THE 
FORREST GOMP OF POLITICS. 
HE HAS ESSENTIALLY BEEN THERE 
IN EVERY WATER SHED MOMENT OVER 
THE LAST 20 YEARS. 
GO BACK TO BUSH V GORE, WHITE 
WATER, NOW YOU LOOK HERE IN THE 
2000s THAT SOME OF THE VERY 
CONSEQUENTIAL CASES HAVE COME 
UP. 
I THINK THAT'S A VERY 
INTERESTING FRAMING AROUND 
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
ACTUALLY CHUCK SCHUMER IN A 
PREVIOUS NOMINATION HEARING 
SAID THAT IT IS SALT IN THE 
WOUND FOR THE DEMOCRATIC BASE 
TO HAVE SOMEBODY LIKE THIS THAT 
THEY HAVE TO CONSIDER. 
SO AGAIN, THESE ARE ALL OF THE 
OLD STATEMENTS AND QUOTES THAT 
WILL COME UP AND THEY WILL 
BECOME A PART OF THE DISCUSSION 
HERE. 
I'M VERY INTERESTED TO SEE HOW 
THAT WILL PLAY OUT. 
>> LESLIE, SABRINA, CAITLIN, 
JOEL, THANKS TO YOU ALL. 
>>> JOINING ME NOW IN 
WASHINGTON IS CBS NEWS 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ED 
O'KEEFE. 
SO ED, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE 
BIGGEST OBSTACLES WILL BE HERE 
FOR KAVANAUGH IN GETTING 
CONFIRMED? 
>> Reporter: ENSURING HE COULD 
GT ALL THE REPUBLICAN VOTES HE 
COULD FIND AND HE HOLDS THE GOP 
CONFERENCE TOGETHER. 
IF HE COULD DO THAT, IT IS BALL 
GAME BASICALLY. 
BECAUSE, OF COURSE, REPUBLICANS 
CONTROL THE SENATE BY TWO VOTES 
OR IF THEY NEED TO BREAK A TIE, 
THEY HAVE VICE PRESIDENT PENCE. 
SO MOST OF THE FOCUS IN THE 
COMING DAYS WILL BEGIN WITH 
LISA MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA AND 
SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE. 
SENATOR COLLINS ISSUING A 
STATEMENT SAYING SHE IS GOING 
TO RESERVE JUDGMENT AND LOOKS 
FORWARD TO THOROUGHLY REVIEWING 
HIS RECORD.  
KEEP AN EYE ALSO ON A 
COLLECTION OF MODERATE 
DEMOCRATS. 
JOE MANCHIN OF WEST VIRGINIA AS 
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. 
JOE DONNELLY OF INDIANA AND 
HEIDI HEITKAMP OF NORTH DAKOTA. 
YOU READ OFF THERE JUST A 
MOMENT AGO THE STATEMENT FROM 
SENATOR MANCHIN SAYING HE IS 
GOING TO FOCUS IN ON HEALTH 
CARE AND WHETHER OR NOT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH WOULD SORT OF 
ESSENTIALLY PRESERVE THE 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 
ONE OF THE NOTABLE RULINGS THAT 
HE HAS MADE OR VOTES HE HAS 
CAST WAS IN ONE OF THE CASES 
REGARDING THE CONTRACEPTIONIVE 
MANDATE OF THE AFFORDABLE -- 
CONTRACEPTIVE MANDATE OF THE 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 
HE, AMONG OTHER NOMINEES, HAVE 
SUGGESTED THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE 
FULL SCOPE OF IT. 
HOWEVER, HE WAS AMONG THOSE 
THAT SORT OF WENT ALONG WITH 
JOHN ROBERT'S THEORY THAT THE 
ACA WAS AN ESSENCE OF ATTACKS, 
SOMETHING THAT COULD PERSEVERE. 
WE WILL SEE BE THAT HELPS OUT, 
BUT MAYBE SOME CONSERVATIVES 
WHO WOULD BELIEVE HE PERHAPS 
WASN'T AS STRIDENTLY 
CONSERVATIVE. 
BUT THEY WERE ON THE EXTREME. 
WATCH THOSE TWO MODERATE 
REPUBLICANS. 
WATCH THOSE THREE MODERATE 
DEMOCRATS.    
THEN WE WILL SEE WHERE IT GOES 
FROM THERE. 
>> WE SAW, ED, OUTSIDE THE 
SUPREME COURT AHEAD OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S ANNOUNCEMENT, 
DEMONSTRATORS THERE WHO WERE 
CONCERNED AND, IN FACT, I 
BELIEVE THIS IS A LOOK AT IT 
RIGHT NOW. 
YOU SEE SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS 
OUTSIDE THE SUPREME COURT. 
DO WE KNOW WHERE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH STANDS ON THE ISSUE 
OF ABORTION RIGHTS? 
>> I DON'T HAVE IT IMMEDIATELY 
AVAILABLE, BUT YOU KNOW, HE 
WOULD NOT BE SOMEONE SUFFICIENT 
FOR THIS LIST BECAUSE YOU KNOW 
REMEMBER THIS WAS A LIST 
COMPILED BY THE HERITAGE 
FOUNDATION AND THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN. 
THEY WILL BE HEADED RURAL IN A 
WAY THAT WOULD PRESERVE ROE V. 
WADE OR ENTERTAIN THE IDEA OF 
EXPANDING ABORTION RIGHTS AS 
CONSERVATIVES WOULD PREFER 
BEFORE. 
I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME, 
SO I COULDN'T BE CERTAIN. 
BUT HE WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THIS 
LIST THAT THE PRESIDENT WORKED 
OFF OF IF HE WASN'T DUE TO 
BESUFFICIENT IN THAT REGARD. 
>> YOU MENTIONEDLY IS A 
MURKOWSKI AND SUSAN COLLINS. 
AS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
HERE AROUND THE TABLE, THERE 
ARE ULTIMATELY, THEY ARE 
REPUBLICANS.    
SO IS THERE A REALISTIC SENSE 
THAT THERE IS A DANGER OF THEM 
BREAKING AWAY BECAUSE OF ALL 
THE CHOICES HERE. 
THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT MAYBES 
AMY CONEY BARRETT WOULD -- 
MAYBE AMY CONEY BARRETT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH. 
BUT NOW GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT 
IS BRETT KAVANAUGH, DO YOU 
THINK THAT MAY, IN FACT, EASE 
SOME OF THAT CONCERN? 
>> THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE 
IT WOULD BE EASIER TO WIN OVER 
THEIR SUPPORT, WHERE THERE IS 
GOING TO BE TROUBLE NOW BASED 
ON THE ASSESSMENT OF SENATE 
MAJORITY LEADER, MCCONNELL OVER 
THE WEEK. 
IS THE PAPER TRAIL KAVANAUGH 
HAS. 
PREVIOUS TO THAT HE DEALT WITH 
A LOT OF PAPER WORK WHEN HE 
SERVED AS A STAFF SECRETARY, 
WHO CONTROLS THE PAPER THROW TO 
THE DESK. 
IT DOESN'T MEAN HE WROTE THE 
PAPERWORK THAT'S HANDED TO THE 
PRESIDENT. 
HE WOULD HAVE REVIEWED IT. 
SO THEY ARE GOING TO 
UNDOUBTEDLY BE ATTEMPTED FOR 
DEMOCRATS TO WITH INVOLVED 
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE SEVEN 11 
ATTACKS. 
YOU HEARD HIM SAY THERE IN HIS 
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS THAT HE 
WORKED AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
WAS THERE ON 9/11. 
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN BECAUSE THIS 
IS SOMEONE WHO HANDLED -- WOULD 
HAVE BEEN BECAUSE THIS IS 
SOMEONE WHO HANDLES THE PAPER 
FLOW. 
IF NOT DERAIL THE NOMINATION, 
CERTAINLY PROLONG IT AND FORCE 
A VOTE LATER IN THE TIMETABLE 
THAN REPUBLICANS WOULD PREFER. 
THE OTHER THING TOO IS THAT 
REPUBLICAN, AS WE TALKING 
ABOUT, DURING THE CLINTON 
IMPOACHMENT. 
WHAT MIGHT REFLECT OPINION WHAT 
IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP GIVEN THAT 
THERE IS A SPECIAL COUNCIL JUST 
AS KENT STAR WAS, INVESTIGATING 
THE CURRENT PRESIDENT, YOU 
KNOW, WILL HE BE ASKED TO 
COMMENT ON THA? 
WILL IT BE RELEVANT AT ALL OR 
SEEN OUT OF BOUNDS? 
THERE IS A LOT TO WORK WITH 
HIM. 
THERE IS NO DOUBT HE IS AN 
EXPERIENCED JUDICIAL MIND. 
NO DOUBT HE CHECKS A LOT OF 
BOXES FOR CONSERVATIVE. 
HIS SUPPORTERS WILL EMBRACE THE 
FACT HE'S A FAMILY MAN WITH TWO 
YOUNG DAUGHTERS, VERY ACTIVE IN 
THEIR COMMUNITY. 
BUT HE DOES NOTHING TO FULFILL 
THE PRESIDENT'S VOW TO DRAIN 
THE SWAMP. 
THIS IS SOMEONE BORN AND RAISED 
IN WASHINGTON, HAS BUILT A 
PROFESSIONAL CAREER IN 
WASHINGTON. 
MET HIS WIFE WHILE WORKING AT 
THE WHITE HOUSE. 
HIS WIFE IS ON THE TOWN COUNCIL 
OF CHEVY CHASE, WHICH IS A 
COMMUNITY JUST OUTSIDE 
WASHINGTON. 
CERTAINLY ADJOINS THE SWAMP 
WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY 
IN THE LATEST THEY BELIEVE. 
THAT IS AN INTERESTING, YOU 
KNOW, THING, THAT WE KNOW AT 
ONE POINT ANOTHER, HE WAS 
LOOKING AT NOMINEES WHO WERE 
NOT EDUCATED AT HARVARD OR 
YALE. 
KAVANAUGH WAS. 
SO IN THAT REGARD THAT IS AT 
LEAST A DEPARTURE FROM TRUMP'S 
OTHER VOWS. 
UNDOUBTEDLY CONSERVATIVES WILL 
BE HAPPY WITH THIS PICK. 
MOST LIBERALS WILL BE FURIOUS 
ABOUT THIS. 
ULTIMATELY KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE 
BALL. 
CAN HE GET TO AT LEAST 50 
VOTES? 
CAN HE HOLD THE REPUBLICAN 
CONFERENCE TOGETHER? 
AND IF HE DOES, THAT IS GAME 
SET MATCH AND THIS THING IS 
GOING TO A CONFIRMATION VOTE. 
HE'LL BE ON THE COURT BY THE 
FALL. 
>> ALL RIGHT, ED O'KEEFE IN 
WASHINGTON FOR US. 
ED, THANKS SO MUCH. 
>>> LET'S HEAD TO 1600 
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE RIGHT NOW, 
THE NORTH LAWN, AND CBS NEWS 
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, 
WEIJIA JIANG THERE. 
SO WEIJIA, YOU WERE IN THE EAST 
ROOM FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
ANNOUNCEMENT. 
TELL US ABOUT WHAT THAT MOOD 
WAS LIKE AND WHAT YOU SAW. 
>> Reporter: AS THE PRESIDENT 
WALKED OUT, HE WAS REALLY 
BEAMING BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS 
HOW IMPORTANT THIS DECISION IS, 
A DEFINING MOMENT OF HIS 
PRESIDENCY. 
HE HAD BEEN TEASING IT ALL WEEK 
LONG IN TWEETS AND ANY TIME HE 
COULD SPEAK OUT IN PUBLIC. 
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO IM. 
BECAUSE OF THAT, UNTIL THE 
WORDS JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH 
LEFT HIS LIPS, HE TOOK GREAT 
EFFORT TO KEEP THAT NAME SEALED 
BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT ANY 
LEAK TO SORT OF DAMPER HIS 
MOMENT, HIS NIGHT, NOT THAT IT 
WAS A SURPRISE, YOU KNOW, AS 
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL 
NIGHT.    
ON PAPER, IT MAKES PERFECT 
SENSE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO 
CHOOSE JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
HE HAD THE CREDENTIALS, THE 
PEDIGREE, THE EXPERIENCE THAT 
HE SO ADMIRES.    
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU 
NEVER KNOW WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND EVEN IF THEY HAVE SOMETHING 
ON A RESUME THAT LOOKS GOOD, 
YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW HE 
HEIGHT CHOOSE. 
BUT ONE THING WE CLEARLY SAW 
TONIGHT IN THE EAST ROOM WAS 
THE PERSON WHO JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
IS, RIGHT? 
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BY 
DESIGN. 
HIS FAMILY WAS RIGHT NEXT TO 
HIM. 
HE LOOKED OUT TO HIS PARENTS 
WHO WERE SITTING NEXT TO FIRST 
LADY MELANIA TRUMP. 
HIS WIFE AND TWO YOUNG 
DAUGHTERS WERE NEXT TO HIM. 
HE TALKED ABOUT THEM A LOT. 
HE TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH HE 
LOVED HIS FAMILY, HOW HE LOVED 
BEING A FATHER, AND EVEN GAVE, 
YOU KNOW, A LOW FIVE TO HIS 
YOUNGEST DAUGHTER. 
TALKED ABOUT HIS OTHER 
DAUGHTER'S SOFTBALL 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
HE HAPPENS TO COACH THEIR TEAM. 
SO HE WAS ABLE TO PRESENT A 
DIFFERENT PICTURE THAN WHAT 
WE'VE BEEN REPORTING, WHICH IS 
BASICALLY ALL OF HIS 
CREDENTIALS, RIGHT? 
AND SO WE KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP 
VALUES THIS. 
WHEN HE FEELS THAT CHEMISTRY 
WITH SOMEONE, WHEN HE SEES 
SOMEONE IS A FAMILY MAN AS HE 
HAS TALKED ABOUT IN THE PAST, 
HE APPRECIATES THAT.    
ALL THAT BEING SAID AS ED WAS 
JUST TALKING ABOUT, THIS IS 
GOING TO BE A GRUELING PROCESS 
TO GET HIM CONFIRMED. 
THE WHITE HOUSE IS WELL AWARE 
OF THAT. 
IN FACT SOURCES HERE, THEY TOLD 
US THEY WERE PREPARED WITH FOUR 
DIFFERENT ROLLOUT PLANS BECAUSE 
THERE WERE FOUR POTENTIAL 
CANDIDATES ON THE PRESIDENT'S 
SHORT LIST.  
AND THEY WERE READY TO GO 
BECAUSE THEY KNEW AS SOON AS 
THAT NAME WAS ANNOUNCED, THEY 
WERE ON A MISSION TO TRY TO GET 
THIS PERSON CONFIRMED. 
THEY ARE ALREADY AT WORK. 
THE TEAM IS LED BY WHITE HOUSE 
COUNCIL DON MCGAHN WHO PLAYED 
THE SAME ROLE WHEN JUSTICE NEIL 
GORSUCH WAS NOMINATED. 
THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF THE WORK 
AHEAD OF THEM. 
BUT AS FOR TONIGHT, IT WAS A 
TREMENDOUS MOMENT FOR PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, HIS NOW SECOND NOMINEE. 
AND IT IS REALLY A CAMPAIGN 
PROMISE FILLED. 
>> ALL RIGHT, WEIJIA JIANG AT 
THE WHITE HOUSE FOR US, WEIJIA, 
THANK YOU.   
>>> JOINING ME NOW FROM OUR 
ANALYSIS IS JESSE WEBER, AN 
ATTORNEY AND HOST AT THE LAW 
AND CRIME NETWORK. 
JESSICA LIVENSON IS A LOW 
PROFESSION JOINING US NOW. 
WELCOME TO YOU BOTH. 
HOW
>> IT IS NOT JUST A DIFFERENCE. 
THEY HAVE A SIMILARITY IN 
EDUCATION AND PEDIGREE AND 
CREDENTIALS, WHICH IS ALL 
GREAT. 
BUT THE IMPACT OF THIS DECISION 
IS REALLY WHAT MAKES THIS SO 
DIFFERENT. 
THIS MAN IS GOING TO BE 
SCRUTINIZED. 
WE TALKED ABOUT IT OVER 300 
OPINIONS. 
THE HOMEWORK THAT IS GOING TO 
HAVE TO BE DONE BY THE SENATORS 
AND THE CLERKS IS NOT AN EASY 
TASK AND NOT A FUN TASK. 
EVERY WORD, EVERY DECISION WILL 
BE GRILLED. 
NOW HIS RECORD IS A LITTLE BIT 
DIFFERENT THAN GORSUCH. 
HE CAME FROM A VERY DIFFERENT 
BACKGROUND. 
HE SERVED ON THE DC COURT OF 
APPEALS. 
HE WORKED AS A STAFF SECRETARY 
WITH GEORGE BUSH. 
HIS BACKGROUND IS DIFFERENT. 
THAT IS ALL IMPORTANT MOVING 
FORWARD. 
I THINK THE WORDS THAT HE 
DELIVERED TONIGHT WERE VERY 
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT GORSUCH 
DELIVERED. 
DID YOU HEAR THE FLAVOR OF 
WOMEN, WOMEN, WOMEN? 
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE ELEPHANT IN 
THE ROOM WITH ROE V. WADE. 
HE IS VERY STRATEGIC. 
BY THE WAY THIS IS THE FIRST 
TIME MANY PEOPLE HAVE EVER 
HEARD HIM SPEAK, GIVING YOU AN 
IDEA OF HOW STRATEGIC HE MIGHT 
BE. 
>> WHAT DID YOU  HEAR IN THE 
REMARKS BY JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
TODAY? 
>> I HEARD HIM TELLING US 
SOMETHING ABOUT HIMSELF. 
I HEARD HIM TALKING ABOUT HIS 
PARENTS. 
I HEARD HIM TALKING ABOUT THE 
IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC SERVICE, A 
FAMILY. 
HE TALKED ABOUT THE OLDER 
GENERATION, THE YOUNGER 
GENERATION. 
HE PRAISED HIS WIFE. 
I THINK A LOT OF WHAT HE WAS 
DOING TONIGHT WAS INTRODUCING 
HIMSELF TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC 
AS SOMEONE WHO IS LIKABLE, WHO 
CARES ABOUT WHAT THEY CARE 
ABOUT. 
I THINK WHAT HE WAS REALLY 
DOING IS SAYING THERE IS NO 
REASON TO BE WORRIED ABOUT ME 
IF YOU ARE TO THE LEFT OF THE 
AISLE. 
I'M A VERY REASONABLE PERSON.   
WE CAN IDENTIFY WITH EACH 
OTHER, AND THEN IN A LOT OF 
WAYS IT WAS A WAY A POLITICIAN 
MIGHT INTRODUCE THEMSELVES TO 
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SAYING WE 
ARE PARENTS AND HERE IS HOW I 
MET MY WIFE. 
HERE IS A LITTLE SOMETHING 
ABOUT MY FAMILY. 
I'M HUGELY HUMBLED TO BE HERE. 
SO AGAIN, I THINK A LOT
