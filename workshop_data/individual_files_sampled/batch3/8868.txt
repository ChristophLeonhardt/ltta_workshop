Dana: DEMOCRATS SEARCHING FOR POLICY IDEAS AND A GOOD CANDIDATE TO RUN AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 2020. SOME WHO ARE CONSIDERING A RUN WERE AT A FORUM YESTERDAY. TESTING OUT MESSAGES. WATCH. MY NEIGHBORS, MY RESIDENTS ARE INCREDIBLE FOLK WHO WORK HARD AT ANYTHING. IN FACT, I WOULD ARGUE THEY ARE WORKING HARDER THAN THEIR PARENTS DID BUT THEY ARE MAKING LESS MONEY. I THINK THIS ELECTION CALLS FOR BOLD IDEAS. I THINK THE WOMEN HAVE TO BE SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE THINGS THEY WANT. MEDICARE FOR ALL, UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE, DEBT FREE COLLEGE, CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, IMMIGRATION REFORM, GUN REFORM. INVEST IN CLEAN ENERGY. EXPAND SOCIAL SECURITY. REBUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. BREAK UP THE BANKS, BRING BACK THE UNIONS. Dana: COLIN REED IS A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF DESIGNERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND A COLUMNIST. RICHARD FOWLER IS A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND BOTH GOOD FRIENDS. ELIZABETH WARREN IS GIVING US A LOT OF THOUGHT. YOU KNOW HER WELL GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW MASSACHUSETTS AND BOSTON CERTAINLY. LET ME READ TO YOU SOMETHING THAT DANA MILLBANK WROTE. I ALWAYS READ HIM. HE WAS AT THE EVENT YESTERDAY AND HE SAID FOR NOVEMBER'S MID-TERM ELECTIONS IT MAY BE ENOUGH FOR DEMOCRATS TO SAY THEY ARE AGAINST TRUMP. BUT TO BEAT TRUMP, THEY WILL NEED MORE. TRUMP CONVINCED TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS THAT THEY ARE LOSING GROUND BECAUSE OF IMMIGRANTS, RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS MINORITIES AND FOREIGNERS. WHAT WILL DEMOCRATS ADVANCE TO COUNTER THAT GRIM MESSAGE? DID YOU HEAR IT IN WHAT ELIZABETH WARREN WAS SAYING? I'LL GO TO YOU, COLIN. IT'S TRUE BEFORE WE GET TO 2020, WE CAN LOOK TO 2018 AS INSTRUCTION MANUAL FOR HOW THE DEMOCRATS WILL RUN. IN 2018 IT IS A REFERENDUM ON TRUMP. THAT IS THEIR ONLY MESSAGE. THEY DON'T HAVE AN ECONOMIC MESSAGE. A LOT OF DEMOCRATS WOULD ADMIT THAT. I DON'T KNOW IT WILL WORK IN 2018, ESPECIALLY WITH AN ECONOMY GOING THE WAY IT IS AND ALSO WITH THE DEMOCRATS NOMINATING BERNIE SANDERS IN PLACES LIKE NEBRASKA LAST NIGHT. Dana: RICHARD, I WANT TO ASK YOU TWO THINGS. IS THE ECONOMIC MESSAGE WHAT NANCY PELOSI HAS SUGGESTED TO ROLL BACK THE TAX PACKAGE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ABLE TO ADVANCE IN DECEMBER? SECONDLY, DO ANY OF THE PEOPLE MATTER WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO ONE OF THE FORUMS TO TEST THE WATERS FOR 2020 IF BERNIE SANDERS IS GOING TO RUN AGAIN? TO ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION TO SOME EXTENT NANCY PELOSI IS RIGHT. PART OF IT IS ROLLING BACK THE TAX PACKAGE. THE OTHER PART IS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BETTER DEAL. THAT IS WHAT YOU HEARD CONOR LAMB TALK ABOUT WHEN HE RAN FOR CONGRESS THIS PAST MARCH. THE IDEAL OF HOW DO WE FIX HEALTHCARE? NOT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. BUT HOW DO WE FIX HEALTHCARE ON THE EMPLOYER-BASED SIDE? PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEING THE HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS GO UP. BUT TO ANSWER THE SECOND QUESTION IT'S TOO PREMATURE TO THINK ABOUT 2020 ALREADY SEEING THAT, REMEMBER THIS TIME IN 2014 DONALD TRUMP WASN'T EVEN ON THE RADAR. NOW HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. BUT DEMOCRATS HAVE TO DO A COUPLE OF THINGS GOING INTO THIS MID-TERM ELECTION AND THE GENERAL. HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT HEALTHCARE, AND ON TOP OF THAT HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH THE ISSUES CONCERNING THEM AT THEIR KITCHEN TABLES. FIXING PUBLIC EDUCATION. NORTH KOREA NORTH CAROLINA IS THE NEXT STATE TO GO ON A STATEWIDE TEACHER STRIKE THIS WEEK. THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. Dana: COLIN, THE DEMOCRATS PUT OUT A DOCUMENT CALLED "A BETTER DEAL." I ACTUALLY READ IT. THERE ARE SOME GOOD POLICY IN THERE. ONE OF THE THINGS I SAW THAT IS FRUSTRATING DEMOCRATS IS THAT OTHER PLACES ON CABLE NEWS WILL NOT TALK ABOUT THIS DEAL BECAUSE THEY ARE OBSESSED WITH THE RUSSIA COVERAGE. DO THE DEMOCRATS, HAVE THEY BOXED THEMSELVES IN BY TALKING ABOUT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION SO MUCH THAT THEY CAN'T ACTUALLY GET ATTENTION FOR POLICIES THEY WANT TO PUT FORWARD? THEY HAVE. THEY HAVE BANKED EVERYTHING ON THIS RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. IF IT COMES BACK AND BOB MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION SAYS NOTHING WAS THERE, THEN DEMOCRATS ARE IN A TERRIBLE SPOT POLITICALLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE PLACED SO MUCH POLITICAL CAPITAL ON IT. CONOR LAMB DID NOT TALK ABOUT THE BETTER WAY. HE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WASN'T GOING TO VOTE FOR NANCY PELOSI. IS THE ONLY REASON HE RAN IN PENNSYLVANIA 18. SHE REMAINS THE BIGGEST LIABILITY AND SHE MADE IT CLEAR SHE IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE. SHE IS A HUGE IMPEDIMENT FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO GO ANYWHERE. Dana: LAST WORD, RICHARD. IT'S NAIVE TO BRING CONOR LAMB TO ONE ISSUE. HE TALKED ABOUT THE COAL MINERS AS WELL. YOU ARE RIGHT THAT BECAUSE OF THIS RUSSIA COLLUSION THING AND THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT KEEPS TWEETING ABOUT IT, THE DEMOCRATS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FOCUS ON THE BETTER WAY CAMPAIGN WHICH TALKS ABOUT HOW TO LOWER THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, WHICH TALKS ABOUT HOW WE FIX EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND HOW WE FUND PUBLIC EDUCATION SO TEACHERS DON'T HAVE TO GO ON STRIKE IN ANOTHER STATE. Dana: RICHARD, I WILL HAVE YOU BACK AND I WILL TAKE THE LAST WORD HERE. PLEASE. Dana: IN ALL THAT YOU ARE SAYING I UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE THINGS RESONATE VERY WELL WITH THE BASE. BUT FOR THE VOTERS WHO VOTED FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THEN DECIDED TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, I DON'T HEAR WHAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE FROM AN ECONOMIC MESSAGE TO CAPTURE THOSE VOTERS AND BRING THEM BACK TO THE DEMOCRATIC CAMP. THEY ARE WRAPPING ME.
