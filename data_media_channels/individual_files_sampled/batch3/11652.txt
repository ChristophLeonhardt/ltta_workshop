on the huge space stretching from Lisbon to Vladivostok and in the future perhaps even Shanghai this is why Belarus has consistently advocated for the integration of integrations as the principle of Akko of cooperation that aims to find optimal ways to bring together economic growth and sustainable development achieving the goals of the sustainable development agenda with its overarching promise to leave no one behind requires a particular focus and international support for middle-income countries indeed it is this group of countries that is home to five of the seven billion that comprised the world's population and the greatest potential for economic growth and ensuring global sustainability on the other hand it is within this group of countries that three-quarters of the world's poor reside and they are the most vulnerable to such factors as global economic fluctuations consequences of regional conflicts natural and man-made catastrophes climate upheavals epidemics which all threaten social and economic stability and exacerbate inequality including at the regional and global levels and in this context it is unjust that development progress continues to be gauged exclusively on the basis of per-capita income that criterion does not reflect the economic social nor environmental features inherent to middle-income countries for Belarus it is evident that the multi-dimensional dimensional nature of the threats faced by challenge by the countries of this category including our country requires multi-dimensional development criteria that would also be instrumental in designing the UN systems result-oriented strategies Belarus hopes that the high-level meeting to comprehensively discuss these issues which the president of the General Assembly plans to convene in the near future will provide a serious impetus for United Nations to design and implement specific measures in this area ladies and gentlemen another multi-dimensional issue is in Bingley coming to the forefront humanity has entered a new era as digital technologies are drastically transforming our lives the importance of the digital economy for sustainable comprehensive economic growth is something that our country understands very well last March the presidential decree mm the development of the digital economy entered into force and it seeks to turn Belarus into an IT country the number of residents and in terms of its exports digital technologies are justly creation Shan they stimulate ployed in those sectors in danger and make them vulnerable it is evidence that governments in developed and many developing countries will ization and how to tended negative impacts of digitization in this regard we would propose that the UN establishes international cooperation on jittered ization and technological forecasting for sustainable development the purpose of such cooperation would be to assist developing countries in finding their own niche in the global digital economy as well as multiply the benefits of digitization and ensure that they are distributed equally equitably we welcome the establishment of the high-level panel on digital cooperation under the auspices of the secretary-general and we hope that it will pay particular attention to the issue of capacity building in this area it is absolutely clear that capacity building here is impossible without shared sustainability and prosperity this is the fundamental basis of those tasks that the world's governments can only address together unfortunately these values are often sacrificed to confrontational thinking which we are seeing more and more often at the 2015 UN summit the president of Belarus spoke about the impossibility of attaining achieving sustainable development without lasting peace and security and this remains very relevant today true sustainability cannot be achieved outside a strong security framework whose strength is indeed being tested day in and once shared threat we face is terrorism combating it requires a comprehensive approach or by all countries would uphold the principles of international law and avoid double standards we welcome and stand willing to support the efforts of un leadership's to mount a common front against terrorism our country's contribution to global processes in this area will be to convene a high-level international conference on preventing terrorism in the digital age which will organize Cee at the capital of Belarus in a week's time on October 9th and 10th ladies and gentlemen turning to the years we must once again note the evidence the world is once again facing unprecedented threats and challenges confrontation international relations leads to more and more mentions of a new Cold points to a crisis in diplomacy and seriously undermines the authority of the UN as the key international organization tasked with preventing international conflicts the degree of divergence in relations and views between a number of great powers in the world has reached a boiling point the situation indeed is becoming absurd in certain aspects key bodies of the UN and the Security Council first and foremost are turning into an arena for confrontation and political grandstanding and self-assertion with confrontation prevailing over dialogue and geopolitical ambitions taking the upper hand over common sense like many in this hall I regrettably do not have any recipes for how to fix this situation but we are deeply convinced that there is no other clear however that these shared values cannot be arrived at by its security and ensure the well-being of its population we believe that people living in places where real firm Authority is absent could testify to this being true more than anyone else so if we are all truly interested in ensuring global stability ours which today must once again learn to listen to each other and to hear each other arguments and be was these great powers that determine the destiny of the planet today they no longer enjoy such an exclusive parabolas as well as leadership and advancing them is thus in Econ for progress president of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko come existing disagreements that plague interstate relations in the year at last that only dialogue crisis of trust that currently exists in international relations and lead to mechanisms that would truly serve to strengthen astir president can one day or one meeting change history the great Indian leader dura Haram narrow called this moment a tryst with destiny sure I am see Vladimir McKay Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Bali to address the General Assembly excellency Maria Fernanda Espinosa on her election as president of the current and as well as her assistants and vice presidents wishing them all this appreciation he's an efficiency of your predecessor mr. Mayall Slava logic for presiding over the 72nd Nationals which are all the Masek pillars of the UN they exemplify the hopes and ambitions that we all aspire to achieve we along with the international community look forward to this leadership role played by the UN to promote a balanced developing and sustainable societies patient to undertake his necessary role in serving humanity and confronting all chala can be more effective and capable of responding to such challenges mr. president the National Dialogue initiative led by His Excellency Omar Hassan in 2014 led to the formation of the government of national accord with the participation of all spectres and movements in Darfur which shows the peaceful settlement of this crisis along the doha document for peace positively in promoting peace and security all over the country it was crowned with the successors of the first two phases of the exit strategy of Yanam it pursuant to Security Council resolutions 2363 of 2017 and 24:29 of thousand and eighteen this exemplified yet another success story in the transition from peacekeeping to recovery recovery phase the partnership or we hope that the United Nations the donors and friendly countries would participate effectively in the donors conference due to be held is the only path towards peace thus it extended helping hand to the armed groups in southern business to open up access to humanitarian concern of humanitarian assistance to southern Kuna and Blue Nile those regions under the control of the rebel movements in the Blue Nile which the government of Sudan agreed that the United Nations Lutheran humanitarian assistance fiscal policies and set transitional strategic policies to sustainable development and the 2030 agenda despite those wise policies adopted by the government to mobilize local resources and promote the role however the lateral sanctions imposed on my country the impact of the accumulated foreign debt led to undermine our ability to engage in the necessary development activities it has also undermined attract the necessaries have any debt exemption according to the epics despite the fact that Sudan has met preconditions we reaffirm the need to have a debt exemption along the initiatives known to all well to achieve food security in Africa and the Arab regions so we have to support my country in that field we appreciate the u.s. administration's decision adopted in October 2017 to lift the trade embargo imposed on country we look forward to lift ease code or claim to be supporting terrorism we also look forward to a positive partnership and internationally to combat terrorism in all its forms and aspects we would like in this vein to refer to the by the United States administration that stressed that aspect of Sudanese cooperation tender of the principles of justice and in our attempt to fight impunity however the selective approach adopted by the made this important in that International Court lose its impartiality and led to the disappointment of the international community especially among African countries thus the position of my country is aligned with the decisions adopted by the AU which stresses that this Court is nothing but a political tool that done the mantle of law to achieve political objectives leading to breaking the will of people's especially African people thus we call for heeding to the African voices we warned against the politicization and abuse of the United Nations under the title of international justice based on the cooperation agreement signed between the UN and the ICC which have negative influence on the UN pushing it into the realm of international political conflicts mr. president my government has made concerted effort and hosted huge number of refugees that went beyond three million in numbers we provide them with the necessary assistance covering around 70% of their needs while the international community only responds to 30% of their needs this presents a huge pressure on the communities providing assistance to the host communities especially in light of the harsh economic circumstances of my country those circumstances will not change in the near future thus the influx of refugees towards my country will continue therefore I urge the international community to accelerate the provision of the necessary assistance to my country so that it can uphold its responsibilities towards this humanitarian situation we have made great progress in the field of promoting human rights in Sudan this was crowned by the Human Rights Council that commended our effort and our positive cooperation with the Human Rights councils mechanisms recently my government has made great efforts to combat human trafficking and illegal migration as well as the transnational crime this aimed at bringing peace and stability on all levels with a national regional or international thanks to the geographic location of Sudan in the heart of Africa the last of these efforts was the joint initiative by the countries of the Horn of Africa and the EU to address the root causes of illegitimate migration known as the Whorton process we have high hopes that the international community would reach consensus and recognize the leadership role played by Sudan to combat the issues related to migration we reaffirm our position that rejects terrorism in all its forms and manifestations including state terrorism as a means to achieve political objectives Sudan has expressed such position by committing to all regional and international agreements ratified by the country with long been an effective and active member internationally regionally and bilaterally we have contributed amply in combating such phenomena and prevented so many terrorists or operations thanks to the exchange of information and the very good relations that links Sudan with its partners be they regional international or bilateral in this vein we express great concern due to the Islamophobia phenomena that has been widespread via various means we strongly condemn such acts that lead to differentiation and abuse of religions and spread sentiments of hatred and lead to an environment conducive to violence we should not link terrorism to any religion culture or civilization we have to continue cooperating and engaging with each other to implement the UN global strategy to combat terrorism in a comprehensive manner we stress the need to adopt a comprehensive approach to fight terrorism in it in all its forms and manifestations taking into consideration the different cultural social economic and political aspects related to this phenomena including eradicating poverty in supporting development in nations in Africa and promoting dialogue between the north and south we pay great attention to the environmental issues locally regionally and internationally and we reaffirm our commitment to all agreements related to environment due to the very negative impact of climate change that we have felt in different parts of Sudan due to the desertification the floodings and other aspects this was quite clear in the conflict in Darfur which started with conflicts between the herders and the farmers due to the drought that affected the region and this is a clear demonstration of the direct link between such impact of climate change and environmental deterioration from the one hand and the conflicts on the other hand in Africa we call upon the international community to support the different national and regional initiatives in this field such as the African Green Line as to the issue of water we have adopted a comprehensive approach that is also balanced to manage water resources with other countries partners in the Nile Basin we continue to cooperate and coordinate with those countries notably Egypt and Ethiopia so that we can settle all contentious issues related to the Nile water mr. president once again we stress our full commitment to all international treaties and agreements relevant to international peace and security and the militarization for emerged being the non-proliferation treaty which we have acceded to since 1973 as well as the other nuclear treaties we support all efforts made in this vein and we play an important role in promoting cooperation between African countries to implement the treaty on the ban of the use of chemical weapons we have to stress the pillars and values of peace and stability all over the world to lead to stability we cannot achieve such pillars without eradicating weapons of mass destruction we are fully committed to support all international efforts aimed at realizing such objective we also work on tackling the spread of small and light weapons since they have direct a direct relationship to the transnational organized crime terrorism and drug trafficking we work hard in playing an important leading role in this field in the framework of the AU the league of arab state the different regional and international groupings like the IC GL r as well as on the bilateral level to ensure full control on the borders we would like to express our sincere congratulations to the government and people of the Republic of South Sudan for the progress achieved in reviving the agreement on settling the conflict in South Sudan which was reached in Addis Ababa on the 12th of September 2018 that agreement was signed by all parties to the conflict in addition to the stakeholders from the civil society youth religious leaders and other important members and figures in the community of South Sudan that was the result of negotiations undertaken in heart tune from the 25th of June to the 28th of September 2018 thanks to a initiative launched by His Excellency the president of Sudan and a mandate from the ìgod summit in this line on the 26th of July a the whole Ummah declaration was signed to ensure a ceasefire in South Sudan later all parties to the conflict started the negotiation process following this step a number of other agreements were signed the last of which was on the 30th of August 2018 thanks to the sincere effort made by the Sudanese mediation because we always uphold the principle of settling African conflicts within Africa we must also highly appreciate the great efforts made by ìgod and the leaders of its member countries for they have effectively contributed to the achievements realized we would like to refer to the efforts made by the Prime Minister of Ethiopia the head of I God His Excellency Abu Ahmed and His Excellency the Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and the Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta their concerted effort came line in line with the efforts of his Excellency Armour al Bashir which led to the potential of bringing peace in South Sudan would also like to thank the troika countries for their support of the IGAD these are the United States the United Kingdom and the kingdom of Nohr nerve agent kingdom for the support provided to the negotiating process would also like to thank the United Nations the African Union and the European Union for their support during this phase mr. president ladies and gentlemen there is one country on earth capable of speaking about the sacrifices it made for South Sudan that would be my country Sudan we did not agree to voluntarily let go of a quarter of our territories and a third of our people and three-quarters of our petroleum products unless it was for the establishment of statehood in South Sudan allowing the people of this country the right for self-determination in an unprecedented move never seen before in Africa and the only reason for that was to bring peace and stability in Sudan and South Sudan thus we will ensure that all effort is made to maintain peace I stress that those who doubt the capabilities are the leadership's of Sudan and South Sudan to work together or the countries of the region and their capabilities to continue working in unity in support of South Sudan that they have to give peace a chance we hope for a bright future for South Sudan and this cannot be achieved unless we implement the agreement reached as to the donor countries I would like to stress that all your pledges and givings will be worthwhile they will only be a lost cause if the current chance to bring peace was lost in South Sudan therefore I call upon all those countries to continue their support for South Sudan for there they are in dire need for such assistance and contribution the countries of the region during the last summit held in Addis Ababa called on the Security Council to look in expanding the regional protection fools in South Sudan from 4,000 soldiers to 8,000 soldiers and to ensure that Sudan Uganda and Djibouti and Somalia drib ute - these forces and we call for a quick response to start to such appeal so that we can undertake those huge responsibilities since we are the guarantors of peace in South Sudan ladies and gentlemen the separation of South Sudan from Sudan was not an easy or smooth matter there are so many issues still pending among the two countries however this new environment that came as a results of the initiative launched by the President of the Republic amar al Bashir through the mediation between the two countries led to real change in the relations between the those two countries within 41 days only we have tackled so many issues that remained pending for years and build trust among both countries especially thanks to the good relations between Salva Kiir and dr. Ahmed Shari from the one hand and present America Shir the Sudanese mediation therefore all circumstances are currently available and conducive to greater trust and ending this page of conflict forever especially when it comes to the IBA issue we welcome the address of the first vice-president of the Republic South Sudan mr. Tubb and Jane Chi in front of your August Assembly when he stressed that they are willing to contribute positively to settle the problems of South Kordofan and Blue Nile ladies and gentlemen there are so many principles enshrined in the UN Charter and they should be enjoyed by all countries for a most being to live in peace and we call upon the international community to cooperate with us so that we in Sudan and South Sudan can actually live in peace side-by-side just like all other countries Sudan reaffirms its support to the joint initiative between the African Union and the UN to bring peace and stability in the Central African Republic we would like to commend the ample effort made by president Faust on our counter Adara we hope that it will be a great success we have hosted a number of parties and armed movements in from Central Africa and attempted to mediate among them to reach an agreement that would end the division and infighting in the car we will continue on that path under the umbrella of the peace and reconciliation initiative in car in line with what has been announced by mr. Moussa fakey a president of the EU Commission during the high-level meeting held on cart during this GA session Sudan stresses its principled position vis a vie the Palestinian question we condemn any form of aggression on religious sanctities in Palestine notably Albertson and we support the Arab Peace Initiative to establish a Palestinian state along the line of 1967 with East Jerusalem as its capital and the withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories my delegation condemned the gross violations of human rights against the minority Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar as seen in the killing and the demolition of homes and mosques forcing the displacements of thousands from their homes we call upon the international community to take practical steps to stop such violations and bring its perpetrators to accountability we renew our position supporting the constitutional legitimacy in Yemen we call upon all political sectors in Yemen to engage in the political process denounce infighting and avoid the choice of violence so that they can reach a political solution that would stem the bloodshed of Yemenis along the lines of the GCC initiative and the outcomes of the national dialogue as well as Security Council resolutions we also are anxious to ensure the territorial integrity of Syria supportable efforts made so that we can surmount the current crisis in Syria which has been turning more complex day after day we stress the need to bring about stability in Somalia we must provided with all necessary support so that it can confront its different challenges we welcome the breakthrough achieved between Ethiopia and Eritrea we look forward to strengthening bilateral relations between those two countries which would build well on the government's and people of both countries and the countries of the region at large turning to Libya we have long had a principled position supporting the people of Libya striving with the international community to ensure the success of different initiatives that aim at bringing peace and stability in Libya foremost being Liso Herat agreement that represents the main political pillar in Libya we also refuse an object to any interference in the international internal affairs of Libya since this would have huge repercussions catastrophic repercussions on that country its stability and security as well as the countries of the region we express our readiness to host the upcoming meeting of foreign ministers of the countries neighboring Libya ladies and gentlemen we support once again the reform agenda that the secretary-general is striving to implement especially the efforts made to strengthen the different agencies of the General Assembly since it plays a very important role in maintaining international peace and security and such reforms will make it relevant to all people and to face the different renewed challenges once again we would like to to reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism under the leadership of the UN we stress the noble purposes that were the building blocks of the UN for a most being maintaining international peace and security achieving sustainable development and promoting human rights through an approach that is underpinned on international cooperation and dialogue to enhance friendly international relations to settle flicks through the peaceful mechanisms are settling

excellency Maria Fernanda Espinosa gir says president of the General Assembly ladies and gentlemen representatives of member states distinguished delegates receive a message of peace from the people of Nicaragua and from President commandante Daniel Ortega and vice-president Rosario Maria three years after the adoption of the 2030 agenda we continue to bear witness to a world in crisis originated by savage capitalism interference and violations of international law and the sovereignty of our peoples with the use of force attempts at coup d'etat and destabilization that threatened the achievement of the sustainable development goals set forth in the 2030 agenda Nicaragua has resisted the attempts at a coup d'etat our country once again has one piece fraternal coexistence and the progressive return of normal daily life the attempted coup d'etat we overcame in Nicaragua is a result of this interventionism it has left us with serious damage and serious aftermath such as economic damage death destruction and terrorism terrorism disguises peaceful protest with the vicious killings of citizens policemen setting public and private property on fire assaults rape extortion torture and cruel inhumane degrading treatment in our region Nicaragua is highly recognized as a factor for regional stability peace and security with important positive indicators in economic political and social development poverty reduction gender equity and citizens security Nicaragua is a barrier against international organized crime the morass the gangs tourism and drug trafficking activity all state policies which we continue to develop the government and the people of Nicaragua depend defend the principle of independence and sovereignty as established by the charter of the United Nations we therefore demand and insist on the cessation of any interventionist policy in violation of international law with interventionist actions in Nicaragua and against the fraternal peoples of our Americas and of the world the government and the people of Nicaragua have worked in a sustained fashion to meet the objectives of the 2030 agenda until April of this year our country was experiencing sustained economic growth of approximately 4.7 percent per year projects and our social and economic programs to eradicate general poverty at the national level achieved a reduction from forty two point five percent in 2009 to 24 point nine percent in 2016 extreme poverty went down from fourteen point six percent in 2009 to six point nine percent in 2016 today once again we are facing the threat of the United States to curb the social economic and cultural development of our people we denounce the this intervention and interference with a bill in the US Congress or during international financial organizations to oppose the granting of loans to Nicaragua for Nicaragua to contribute to international peace means - it means achieving a general and complete nuclear disarmament this is why we have signed and ratified the first treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons we call on other countries to join us in ratifying this historic treaty the government of the republic of nicaragua supports the denuclearization over the last six decades which has a considerable impact on the lives of the people in the development of the country in our region with you encouraged by the continued dialogue for peace and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula and we hope that the dialogue between the parties will bring an end to the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region Madam President please allow me to take this opportunity to talk about the situation in timor-leste on May 12th of this year we held early legislative elections the elections were held in a peaceful environment and resulted in a new executive led by His Excellency Toma tonraq after period of economic stagnation due to the political crisis the country is resuming its development and economic growth toward doormanity the social economic foundations that we need to create for prosperous and united society were already established with the recent promulgation of the state budget we can continue to improve our social housing and communications infrastructure and thus develop opportunities for investment and economic development another important step for tomorrow lasted was the government's decision to acquire 30% of the capital in the consortium that operate it's the greater sunrise field in the Timor Sea and thus opened the office possibility of bringing the pipeline to timorous territory and the accelerated development of the south coast our historic leader and former President of the Republic and Prime Minister his Excellency analogous mom once again successfully conducted the negotiations we continue to have strong relations with our neighbors namely Indonesia and Australia and we deepen our cooperation with the ASEAN countries and await serially for decision about our request to accede to this organisation timor-leste remains community committed to a strengthened ties of friendship and cooperation with the countries of the community of Portuguese speaking countries in hopes that the Portuguese language which is spoken by about 250 million people worldwide will also be an official language of the United Nations our country has also signed the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons and we encourage all Member States to do so madam president distinguished delegates we live in a world that is different from the post Second World War when the United Nations was created the current times are full of challenges and more than ever all of us need to be prepared to meet the challenges the wishes and aspirations stressing increasingly the value of multilateralism my country firmly believes in the United Nations and in the international system as such we are committed to work in cooperation for the International Peace Security and Prosperity and for the well-being of humanity thank you very much I got this quellek I thank her Excellency miss Maria Elena Perez chair of the delegation of Timor Leste for her statement I now give the floor to His Excellency mr. Ali Nasser Mohammed chair of the delegation of the Maldives you have the floor your excellency thank you madam president bismillah ar-rahman ar-rahim madam president mr. secretary-general ladies and gentlemen I wish to convey my delegations congratulations to you on your election as the president of the 73rd session of the General Assembly your election to preside over this assembly represents the progress we are making towards gender equality a momentum we need to enhance at the global level yet you being only the fourth woman to do so shows how far we still have to go I also wish to commend the secretary-general mr. Antonio goodra's for his leadership in steering the organization during these challenging times madam president the team you have chosen for decision-making the United Nations relevant to all people global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful equitable and sustainable societies is most appropriate now more than ever before we need the international community to work together to build resilient societies to ensure that everyone has a fair share of the benefit of development to achieve that we need the UN to assume greater leadership in unifying our collective efforts the focus should be on building communities that can withstand the shocks and that can bounce back stronger recognizing this the cornerstone of development strategy of the Maldives is building resilience economic resilience institutional resilience environmental resilience and indeed political resilience the Maldives is an old nation but a young democracy in our journey towards democracy consolidation the 23rd September of this year was an extraordinary day on that day maldives held its third multi-party presidential election the election took place peacefully and seamlessly with 89% of water turnout it was a moment that made every Maldivian proud of how far we have come and the accelerate progress that the country has achieved following the election the Maldives is currently going through the process of transfer of power from one elected government to the other the accelerated pace of democratization in the Maldives is going in tandem with even faster growth in social and economic development from one from the humble beginning as one of the poorest countries in the world at independence in 1965 to an upper middle-income country today is a success story by any measure the Maldives has one of the highest human development indicators in the region with nearly universal literacy rates universal immunization and the lowest infant mortality and maternal mortality rates the country has eradicated diseases such as polio measles malaria and lymphatic filariasis although various types of non communicable diseases are emerging as new challenges the progress in social sectors can be sustained and expanded only through strong economic growth president Abdulla yameen Abdul Gayoom in his five years in office focused on developing and modernizing critical infrastructure to stimulate growth in the country's main industries the newly expanded runway at romain International Airport in the ongoing expansion of the airport terminal will significantly boost the tourism industry and create jobs and increase in wealth just a few weeks ago we opened a bridge that connects the capital city Mali with the main International Airport and reclaimed suburb of the capital whole Mali this has transformed the physical landscape of the capital through consolidating through three separate populations and thus helping to achieve economies of scale and better and a patient to climate change at the same time we cannot create islands of progress and prosperity without partnering with our friends the kind of partnerships that are mutually beneficial that are based on mutual trust and partnerships that are envisaged in various international agendas and agreements suggest the 2030 agenda the ADIS Ababa action agenda the Samoa pathway and the Paris agreement the national development efforts by small island developing states suggest the maldives needs support in the form of capacity building transfer of technology and access to finance in order to achieve the goals set out in international development agendas the United Nations can assume a greater level of leadership in fostering such support to be able to do that the UN Secretariat too needs the support of this assembly to assist countries in special situations such as seeds with a more balanced resource allocations the United Nations is the engine room of multilateralism and the small states especially the seeds depend their existence on multilateral norms and yet the principle of international law that governs the friendly relations and cooperation among states are being challenged at a fundamental level there is therefore a need for countries big and small to return to the right side of law the state of Palestine is one place where the occupying power challenges international law and norms on a daily basis with a sense of impunity today once again we join many other countries in calling for a permanent end to the unlawful occupation of Palestinian lands and accord the palestinian people their legitimate right to self-determination the mould is firmly believes that lasting peace can only be possible with a two-state solution in which the State of Palestine achieves its sovereignty within the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital unilateral measures that go against the grain of its internationally accepted arrangements are regressive and illegal the Maldives also calls for a peaceful end to the continuing war in Syria the humanitarian situation continues to worsen the Security Council has not adequately addressed the conflict and its consequences we must take more assertive action to stop the tide of suffering in Syria humanitarian intervention is a necessity a permanent political solution is a must similarly the atrocities that are being committed against Muslims in Myanmar should not be set aside from discussion the Maldives calls on the AAP on the authorities in Myanmar to bring to justice the perpetrators who committed the genocide all crimes against the Rohingya Muslims in particular the recommendations of the UN independent international fact-finding mission on Mir ma needs to be implemented without any delay madam president article 1 of the UN Charter describes the United Nations is the center of harmonization of actions of Nations the UN can meaningfully fulfill that function only if it is fit for the purposes set out in clear terms in the Charter the reform of the Security forms of this secretary-general introduced in recent months in modernizing the development systems of the UN have began to take shape yet our attempts to bring broader systemic reforms to the organization such as the reforms of the Security Council have produced more processes with virtually no successes despite more than four decades of deliberations the United Nations need to be an institution where every member state should feel welcomed we are the combined power of many ideas many solutions and many voices try to address the challenges of climate change ocean ocean degradation poverty exclusion and discrimination for the small island developing states suggest the Maldives the United Nations will always remain the indispensable partner in building our nationalism we see the UN is the key in determining our place and our voice in global discourse ensuring the relevance of the UN must mean ensuring that everyone from the biggest to the smallest play their part it must mean offering everyone a place in finding shared solutions for our shared future it must mean she are in responsibility to deliver a more peaceful a more just equitable and sustainable future for our children and for their children thank you madam president I thank his Excellency mr. Ali Nasser Mohammed chair of the delegation of the Maldives for his statement this juncture we shall move to the exercise of the right of reply which has been requested may I remind members that statements in the exercise of the right of reply are limited to ten minutes for the first intervention and to five minutes for the second intervention and should be made by delegations from their seats I call on the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran you have the floor the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran smelly r-rahmanir-rahim I say that the Razr habla yum it's them in the name of God the merciful and compassionate some days ago the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia took the floor to level false allegations against my country I am thus speaking in Arabic today to be able to respond directly to his allegations to ensure that our position is rendered clear to that neighbouring country the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia stated that his country supported the American strategy against Iran such a position is neither new nor astonishing the position and stances of Saudi Arabia are well known they opposed the people and governments of the region including in fellow Arab nations what is amusing is that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia accuses my country of supporting terrorism this is a most strange and outlandish claim everybody knows very well that Saudi Arabia supports terrorism in a very blatant and widespread manner I will not defend the position of my country as far as counter-terror measures are concerned our history and record in that last area is well known particularly most countries in the region we stand strongly for counterterrorism I simply would like to recall here the links that exist between Saudi Arabia and terrorism render them public before you all and also share with you the Western perspective in response in the framework of WikiLeaks in 2009 Hillary Clinton is said to have stated that Saudi Arabia is the greatest donor to terrorist groups around the world so say we learned that from WikiLeaks the Henry Jackson group submitted in a report on the financing of terrorism information showing that Saudi Arabia is the world's major financier of terrorism and the largest finance of terrorism in the United Kingdom a government inquiry was led by David Cameron in response to carry out an investigation into these allegations in on these allegations of Saudi raiding supported terrorist groups in the United Kingdom many former ambassadors in Riyadh have accused Saudi Arabia of the same actions a European ambassador or red also called to Saudi Arabia the kingdom of terrorism he gave him that nickname accusing them of using their oil wealth to spread terrorism around the entire globe the United States Congress on the 28th of December 2016 adopted by majority a law targeting Saudi Arabia after 16 US Nationals in of the 16 I beg you pardon Saudi nationals who identified as being involved in the September 11 2001 attacks I share all of these facts publicly president in order to ensure that everyone knows that those responsible for terrorist attacks in the Middle East North Africa and Europe is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia we are all well aware that they are the main supporters of daesh and al-qaeda everyone knows very well it is an open secret that the Yemen nation this noble and oppressed nation is suffering as a result of the direct Mash nations and manoeuvres of Saudi Arabia the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia is accusing my country of destabilizing the region as if the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was a strong proponent of stability mayor asked whether the destruction of Yemen did murder of children of women of Yemeni civilians is lending something to stability the destruction of a bus in southern Yemen which cost the lives of dozens of children is that contributing to stability and these children were younger than 15 Mary Collier and they lost their lives in that attack the Saudi Arabia deliberately targeted these children and i underscore that point these children were targeted deliberately and civilians are deliberately targeted in these actions is the blockade against Qatar supporting and contributing to stability is the financing of terrorists in Syria Iraq Yemen and Libya is that serving the course of stability is the creation and founding of terrorist groups in Lebanon doing anything for the cause of stability what about the suicide attack against the Iranian embassy in Beirut I would ask the same question you say that you are defending the Arab identity should Arab identity be used as a cause or pretext to carry out proxy wars in Lebanon to abandon the Palestinian people you are not defending the Arab identity you are killing the Arab identity with your dollars you have no pity for anyone in the Arab world you have no pity for any Arab people including those who are supposedly your allies Saudi Arabia claims that answer Allah has been targeting Saudi Arabia and claims that they have launched some 199 missiles against Saudi Arabia missiles that they claimed were manufactured in Iran
