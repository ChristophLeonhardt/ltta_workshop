00:00:03,868 --> 00:00:05,470
REPORT OPENING MONOLOGUE.

00:00:05,603 --> 00:00:09,974
â™ª

5
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:10,641
>> Sean: I THINK IT'S

6
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,476
IMPORTANT BEFORE WE GET INTO

7
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:12,510
THE CONTENTS OF THIS REPORT

8
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,544
THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO

9
00:00:13,544 --> 00:00:14,479
BREAK DOWN NUT COURSE OF

10
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:15,146
THIS HOUR.

11
00:00:15,146 --> 00:00:15,947
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

12
00:00:15,947 --> 00:00:17,548
UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.

13
00:00:17,548 --> 00:00:19,851
THIS IS SADLY A SWAMP

14
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:20,418
DOCUMENT.

15
00:00:20,418 --> 00:00:21,652
NOW, THE SWAMP ALWAYS

16
00:00:21,652 --> 00:00:22,687
PROTECTS THE SWAMP.

17
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:23,621
UNFORTUNATELY AND IN

18
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:25,356
REALITY, BEFORE WE EVEN GET

19
00:00:25,356 --> 00:00:26,257
STARTED, LET ME JUST REMIND

20
00:00:26,257 --> 00:00:28,092
YOU OF SOMETHING I SAID LAST

21
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:28,392
NIGHT.

22
00:00:28,392 --> 00:00:29,994
THE FACTS IN THIS CASE ARE

23
00:00:29,994 --> 00:00:30,728
NOT IN DISPUTE.

24
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:32,630
THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING

25
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,831
AND CONVERTIBLE.

26
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:35,233
HILLARY VIOLATED THE

27
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:35,833
ESPIONAGE ACT.

28
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,168
THAT'S A FACT.

29
00:00:37,168 --> 00:00:38,769
SHE MISHANDLED.

30
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:41,339
SHE DESTROYED CLASSIFIED-TOP

31
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:42,540
SECRET SPECIAL ACCESS

32
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,174
PROGRAMMING INFORMATION.

33
00:00:43,174 --> 00:00:44,242
IT'S A FACT.

34
00:00:44,242 --> 00:00:47,044
SHE DELETE YOU HAD 33,000

35
00:00:47,044 --> 00:00:48,346
SUBPOENAED EMAILS.

36
00:00:48,346 --> 00:00:49,647
SHE ACID WASHED HER HARD

37
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:50,882
DRIVE WITH BLEACH BIT SO

38
00:00:50,882 --> 00:00:52,950
THEY COULDN'T GET FACTS.

39
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,485
SHE HAD AIDES DESTROY HER

40
00:00:54,485 --> 00:00:56,053
MOBILE DEVICES WITH HAMMERS

41
00:00:56,053 --> 00:00:56,888
ALSO A FACT.

42
00:00:56,888 --> 00:00:59,490
HERE IS ANOTHER FACT

43
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,358
CHRISTIAN

44
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:00,391
KRRISTIAN

45
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:00,424
KRISSTIAN

46
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:00,458
KRISTIIAN

47
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:00,491
KRISTIANN

48
00:01:00,491 --> 00:01:01,025
KRISTIAN SAUCIER SPENT A

49
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:02,660
YEAR IN PRISON FOR, WHAT,

50
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,995
SIX PICTURES ON A CELL PHONE

51
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:05,296
AT A SUBMARINE THAT HE WAS

52
00:01:05,296 --> 00:01:06,330
PROUD HE WORKED ON.

53
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,732
HE NEVER SHARED IT WITH

54
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:08,065
ANYBODY.

55
00:01:08,065 --> 00:01:10,401
SO, IN TERMS OF SEVERITY, IT

56
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:11,435
DOESN'T COMPARE TO WHAT WE

57
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:12,069
KNOW HILLARY CLINTON DID.

58
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:13,504
WE ALSO KNOW THAT COMEY AND

59
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:15,406
TRUMP HATER PETER STRZOK

60
00:01:15,406 --> 00:01:16,774
STARTED WRITING HER

61
00:01:16,774 --> 00:01:18,409
EXONERATION IN EARLY MAY OF

62
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:18,709
2016.

63
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:19,343
THAT'S A FACT.

64
00:01:19,343 --> 00:01:20,244
THEY WILL DIDN'T INTERVIEW

65
00:01:20,244 --> 00:01:22,780
HER UNTIL JULY 2ND 2016 AND

66
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,450
THEN JULY 5TH THEY

67
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,219
EXONERATED HER WE KNOW THEY

68
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:29,320
PULLED THE LEGAL DEFINITION

69
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,454
OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE, THEY

70
00:01:30,454 --> 00:01:31,422
PULLED IT RIGHT OUT OF

71
00:01:31,422 --> 00:01:31,789
DOCUMENT.

72
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:32,957
THEY PULLED OUT IN ONE OF

73
00:01:32,957 --> 00:01:34,358
THEIR EARLIER WRITINGS IN

74
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:36,227
THIS THAT, IN FACT, FOREIGN

75
00:01:36,227 --> 00:01:37,261
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES HAD

76
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:39,330
HACKED INTO THAT BATHROOM

77
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:39,664
CLOSET.

78
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:41,632
ALL A FACT.

79
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,600
EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN

80
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,868
TONIGHT YOU SHOULD BE

81
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:45,236
SHOCKED, YOU SHOULD BE

82
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:46,537
DISAPPOINTED, YOU SHOULD BE

83
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:47,371
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

84
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:48,072
LEARNING.

85
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:51,042
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ABUSE OF

86
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:53,277
POWER AND CORRUPTION AT THE

87
00:01:53,277 --> 00:01:54,812
HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE FBI.

88
00:01:54,812 --> 00:01:57,248
AND HOW THE FBI WAS

89
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,648
POLITICIZED.

90
00:01:57,648 --> 00:01:59,884
IT'S ALL TRUE AND WE HAVE A

91
00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:01,719
LOT OF NEW EVIDENCE WE'LL

92
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,620
SHARE WITH YOU TONIGHT.

93
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,554
I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR AT

94
00:02:03,554 --> 00:02:04,188
THE START.

95
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:05,723
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT RANK

96
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:07,024
AND FILE FBI GUYS.

97
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:08,859
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THEM.

98
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:10,428
I PREDICT BY THE TIME THIS

99
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:12,029
STORY ENDS, THEY WILL END UP

100
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:13,998
BEING THE HEROES WHEN

101
00:02:13,998 --> 00:02:14,732
THEY'RE FINALLY SUBPOENAED

102
00:02:14,732 --> 00:02:17,201
AND ALLOWED TO TESTIFY AND

103
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:18,135
TELL THEIR STORIES ABOUT

104
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:19,904
WHAT THEY SAW THEIR BOSSES

105
00:02:19,904 --> 00:02:22,340
WERE DOING.

106
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,441
AND TONIGHT WE'LL HIGHLIGHT

107
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:24,475
THE STARK DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

108
00:02:24,475 --> 00:02:25,209
TWO INVESTIGATIONS.

109
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:26,844
YOU GET THE WHITE GLOVE

110
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:27,712
SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR

111
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,513
HILLARY CLINTON AND THEN THE

112
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:32,316
HEAVY HANDED TACTICS ALL IN

113
00:02:32,316 --> 00:02:33,217
AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.

114
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:34,318
IT SHOULD SHOCK YOU.

115
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:35,686
IF YOU BELIEVE IN EQUAL

116
00:02:35,686 --> 00:02:37,355
JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW.

117
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:38,422
EQUAL APPLICATION OF OUR

118
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:40,024
LAWS AND OUR CONSTITUTION.

119
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:41,125
NOW, WITH HILLARY CLINTON,

120
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,760
EVERYONE WAS GIVEN IMMUNITY.

121
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,495
WITH DONALD TRUMP, IT'S

122
00:02:44,495 --> 00:02:45,896
SEARCH WARRANTS, SUBPOENAS,

123
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:47,632
BREAKING DOWN DOORS AT 6:00

124
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:49,233
A.M., GUNS ABLAZED.

125
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,868
THE HATRED OF DONALD TRUMP

126
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:52,103
FROM THE LEFT IN THE MEDIA

127
00:02:52,103 --> 00:02:53,938
IN THIS COUNTRY KNOWS NO

128
00:02:53,938 --> 00:02:54,405
BOUNDS.

129
00:02:54,405 --> 00:02:57,241
THERE REALLY WAS A SCHEME TO

130
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:57,875
PROTECT HILLARY RODHAM

131
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,044
CLINTON FROM BEING INDICTED

132
00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:02,680
AND SMEAR AND SLANDER THEN

133
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,247

PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP

135
00:03:04,148 --> 00:03:05,616
AND NOW PRESIDENT AT ALL

136
00:03:05,616 --> 00:03:05,916
COSTS.

137
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,151
NOW THE CONTEMPT FOR YOU,

138
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,487
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

139
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:10,755
THE THING THAT SOME OF THESE

140
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:12,156
PEOPLE SAID ABOUT US, YOU,

141
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:15,192
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS

142
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:16,427
REPUGNANT, IT'S APPALLING.

143
00:03:16,427 --> 00:03:17,561
IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN IN THIS

144
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:17,895
COUNTRY.

145
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:18,529
NOW, TO THE REPORT.

146
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:21,365

00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:23,134
CONFIRM PRETTY MUCH

150
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:23,768
EVERYTHING WE HAVE BEEN

151
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:24,802

THE MEDIA HAVE IGNORED.

154
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:28,639
WE HAVE TREY GOWDY SUMMED IT

155
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,240
UP VERY WELL.

156
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,076
HE SAID, QUOTE:  I AM

157
00:03:32,076 --> 00:03:33,811
ALARMED, ANGERED AND DEEPLY

00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:34,345
DISAPPOINTED BY THE

159
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:35,179
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S FINDINGS

IN THIS REPORT JAMES COMEY'S

182
00:04:03,974 --> 00:04:05,609
ACTIONS WERE BOTH

183
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:07,611
EXTRAORDINARY AND

184
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:08,045
INSUBORDINATE.

00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,494
DURING HILLARY CLINTON'S FBI

195
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:23,861
INTERVIEW.

196
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,363
AN INTERVIEW THAT TOOK PLACE

197
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:27,231
AFTER COMEY HAD ALREADY

198
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:29,133
DRAFTED A LETTER EXONERATING

199
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:30,468
HILLARY OF ALL CHARGES.

200
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:32,236
AND THERE'S MORE.

201
00:04:32,236 --> 00:04:34,071
THE REPORT ALSO FINDS THAT

202
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:34,772
WHILE INVESTIGATING HILLARY

203
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:36,240
CLINTON FOR CONDUCTING

204
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,874
OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT

205
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:38,342
BUSINESS, WITH A PRIVATE

206
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:40,378
EMAIL ACCOUNT, WHOA, JAMES

207
00:04:40,378 --> 00:04:41,879
COMEY WAS ALSO USING A

208
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,714
PRIVATE EMAIL ACCOUNT TO

209
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:44,615
CONDUCT OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT

210
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:45,649
BUSINESS.

211
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:46,784
AND BY THE WAY COMEY

212
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:48,586
RESPONDED ON TWITTER

213
00:04:48,586 --> 00:04:51,255
WRITING, QUOTE:  I RESPECT

214
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:52,456
THE DOJ IG OFFICE.

215
00:04:52,456 --> 00:04:53,891
WHICH IS WHY I URGED THEM TO

216
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:54,892
DO THIS REVIEW.

217
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:55,960
THE CONCLUSIONS ARE

218
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,794
REASONABLE, EVEN THOUGH I

219
00:04:56,794 --> 00:04:57,595
DISAGREE WITH SOME.

220
00:04:57,595 --> 00:05:01,298
PEOPLE OF GOOD FAITH CAN SEE

221
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:03,067
AN UNPRECEDENTED DECISION.

222
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:04,668
I PRAY NO DIRECTOR FACES IT

223
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:04,969
AGAIN.

224
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:06,237
THANKS TO IG'S PEOPLE FOR

225
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:07,037
HARD WORK.

226
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:07,938
LET'S BREAK THIS DOWN.

227
00:05:07,938 --> 00:05:09,507
JAMES COMEY, THE FBI

228
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:13,144
DIRECTOR WENT ROGUE.

229
00:05:13,144 --> 00:05:14,178
THERE IS NO OTHER

230
00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:14,578
CONCLUSION.

231
00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:16,814
HE BROKE LONG STANDING

232
00:05:16,814 --> 00:05:17,848
DEPARTMENT POLICY LITERALLY

233
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:19,216
WRITING THE EXONERATION OF

234
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:20,384
HILLARY CLINTON BEFORE EVER

235
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:21,652

237
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,122
CLOSED UP THE INVESTIGATION.

238
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:27,324
AND IMMEDIATELY THE SAME

239
00:05:27,324 --> 00:05:28,659
PEOPLE THIS HATED TRUMP THAT

240
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:30,261
WE NOW KNOW AND WE'LL PROVE

241
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:35,466
IT IN MORE DETAIL, THE SAME

242
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:38,202
PEOPLE LITTLELY BEGIN THE

243
00:05:38,202 --> 00:05:40,004
EXONERATION OF DONALD TRUMP.

244
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:41,939
THEY EXONERATED HER BACK IN

245
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:42,573

00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:46,844
JULY 5TH SHE IS EXONERATED.

248
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:47,912
SAME PEOPLE THAT COMMITTED

249
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:49,580
THE SAME MISDEEDS AS CLINTON

250
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,548
THEY WERE INVESTIGATED AND

251
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:51,248
PUT IN JAIL.

252
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:52,183
THAT'S WHY COMEY WAS FIRED

253
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:53,017
AROUND SHOULD BE

254
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:53,584
INVESTIGATED FURTHER.

255
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:54,318
THAT'S NOT ALL.

256
00:05:54,318 --> 00:05:55,719
NOW WE HAVE EVEN MORE

257
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:57,321

AGENTS MISHANDLED THE

259
00:05:58,622 --> 00:05:59,490

265
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:07,465
THEY WERE INSTRUCTED TO TAKE

266
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:08,799
NO OVERT INVESTIGATIVE STEPS

267
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:09,767
PRIOR TO THE ELECTION.

268
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:10,801

269
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:12,736

INTO CLINTON.

311
00:07:20,437 --> 00:07:22,640
BUT THAT WAS TO ENSURE WE

312
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,375
DIDN'T BLEEP SOMETHING UP.

313
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,610
THIS MATTERS BECAUSE THIS

314
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:26,944

00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:36,654
COMPARING IT TO THE CLINTON

322
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:37,421
INVESTIGATION WHICH HE TRIED

323
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:41,992
SO HARD NOT TO SCREW UP

324
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:43,494
BECAUSE IT WAS HIS EFFORT TO

00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:44,795

326
00:07:44,795 --> 00:07:45,996

A CANDIDATE.

328
00:07:46,864 --> 00:07:48,065
THE FAVORED CANDIDATE.

329
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:48,799

00:07:54,972 --> 00:07:55,806
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:02,513
LEVELS OF FBI.

342
00:08:02,513 --> 00:08:05,416
SOME OF IT SHOULD SHOCK THE

343
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:05,816
CONSCIENCE.

344
00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:07,217

AGAINST DONALD TRUMP CALLING

349
00:08:14,024 --> 00:08:14,792

353
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:19,964
STRZOK IS THE GUY LEADING

354
00:08:19,964 --> 00:08:21,398
ALL OF THIS INVESTIGATION.

355
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:22,333
THEN THE REPORT CONCLUDED

356
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,068
ABOUT THESE TEXTS, QUOTE:

357
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:25,836
NOT ONLY INDICATIVE OF A

358
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:27,204
BIASED STATE OF MIND, BUT

359
00:08:27,204 --> 00:08:29,039
EVEN MORE SERIOUSLY IMPLIES

360
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,808
A WILLINGNESS TO TAKE

361
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:32,476

ELECTORAL PROSPECTS.

364
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,381
YEAH, THAT'S POLITICAL.

365
00:08:37,381 --> 00:08:38,448

00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:43,087
THEN THE IG FOUND EVIDENCE

369
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:46,023
OF SO MUCH MORE BIAS AMONG

370
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:47,291
FBI OFFICIALS, FOR EXAMPLE,

371
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,626
LOOK AT THIS MESSAGE FROM

372
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:51,161

380
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:02,673
NOTHING.

381
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:04,742
ON OCTOBER 28TH, 2016,

382
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:05,809
SHORTLY AFTER COMEY'S LETTER

THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS

564
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:57,501

CONCLUSIONS, BUT IT WAS

572
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:11,882
