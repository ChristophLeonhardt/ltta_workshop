00:00:02,356 --> 00:00:04,358
SECURITY IS NOT JUST ABOUT

2
00:00:04,358 --> 00:00:05,359
DOLLARS EXTENDED.

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:06,160

LAWS LEAVING HOLLAND TO BE

10
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:18,172
DESIRED.

11
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:18,872
>> President Trump: CRIPPLING

12
00:00:18,872 --> 00:00:19,973
LOOPHOLES IN OUR LAWS HAVE

13
00:00:19,973 --> 00:00:20,808
ENABLED MS-13 GANG MEMBERS AND

14
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:22,810
OTHER CRIMINALS TO INFILTRATE

15
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,547
OUR COMMUNITIES.

16
00:00:26,547 --> 00:00:27,748
>> Shannon: CONGRESSMAN PETER

17
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:28,482
KING FROM NEW YORK WAS SITTING

WE SAW YOU, SIR.

22
00:00:32,686 --> 00:00:34,655
THANKS FOR MAKING TIME TO JOIN

23
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:35,155
US.

24
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:36,590
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT

25
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,560
THAT THE LEFTIST THING TODAY

26
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,395
THAT THIS IS BASICALLY

27
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:42,229
FEARMONGERING ON THE

28
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,696
PRESIDENT PART.

29
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:44,565
THEY SAY TRUMP HAS USED LOOMING

30
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:47,935
FEARS OF MS-13 VIOLENCE AND

31
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:50,971
A FLAGRANTLY RACIST IMMIGRATION

32
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:51,972
PLATFORM, ONE THAT PREDOMINATELY

33
00:00:51,972 --> 00:00:54,808
TARGETS PEOPLE OF COLOR SUCH AS

34
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:58,011
IMMIGRANTS AND THOSE FROM MUSLIM

35
00:00:58,011 --> 00:00:58,746
MAJORITY COUNTRIES AND CONFLATES

36
00:00:58,746 --> 00:01:00,514
IMMIGRANTS WITH ORGANIZED CRIME.

37
00:01:00,514 --> 00:01:01,682
>> OUT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY OR

38
00:01:01,682 --> 00:01:02,182
THEY ARE.

39
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:03,584
THE PEOPLE BEING HURT THE MOST

40
00:01:03,584 --> 00:01:06,220
BY MS-13 ARE ENTIRELY THE

41
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:06,954
HISPANIC UNITY IN THE IMMIGRANT

42
00:01:06,954 --> 00:01:07,321
DIVINITY.

43
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:10,391
THERE ARE NO WHITE MIDDLE-CLASS

44
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:11,759
PEOPLE BEING KILLED BY MS-13.

45
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:12,960
THEY ARE GOING AFTER PEOPLE IN

46
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,762
THE HISPANIC UNITY AND THE

47
00:01:14,762 --> 00:01:16,363
CRIMES THEY COMMIT, CUTTING OFF

48
00:01:16,363 --> 00:01:17,765
THEIR FACES, CUTTING OFF

49
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:19,166
FINGERS, CUTTING OUT PEOPLE'S

50
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:19,500
HEARTS.

51
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,301
DECAPITATING PEOPLE.

52
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:23,570
YOUNG PEOPLE BEING KILLED OFTEN

53
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,206
BY OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE.

54
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:27,374
THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY HAS BEEN

55
00:01:27,374 --> 00:01:29,543
TERRORIZED BY MS-13.

56
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:31,779
EVERYONE, LEFT AND RIGHT,

57
00:01:31,779 --> 00:01:32,579
REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT, WHATEVER

58
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:33,213
SHOULD BE THANKING

59
00:01:33,213 --> 00:01:34,214
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR WHAT HE'S

60
00:01:34,214 --> 00:01:34,515
DOING.

61
00:01:34,515 --> 00:01:35,916
YOU CAN DISAGREE ON OTHER ISSUES

62
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,785
BUT ON THIS ONE, GOING AFTER

63
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:38,485
MS-13

64
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:39,686
MS-13 IS EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING

65
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:40,187
TO DO.

66
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:40,988
THE PARENTS OF THOSE YOUNG

67
00:01:40,988 --> 00:01:43,123
PEOPLE MURDERED, THEY WERE THERE

68
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:44,625
TODAY MAY FULLY SUPPORTED WHAT

69
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:45,793
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THAT TWO OF

70
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:46,827
THE PARENTS HAD THESE PEOPLE ARE

71
00:01:46,827 --> 00:01:48,929
ANIMALS.

72
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:51,265
>> Shannon: YOU'VE HAD A CLOSE

73
00:01:51,265 --> 00:01:52,566
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS

74
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:54,201
BECAUSE THEY'RE BEEN A COUPLE

75
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:55,569
DOZEN MURDERS IN THE LONG ISLAND

76
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:57,171
AREA OVER THE LAST PLAYERS.

77
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:57,771
ATTRIBUTED TO MESSAGING.

78
00:01:57,771 --> 00:01:59,373
WHEN YOU READ THE DETAILS OF

79
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:00,040
THESE CRIMES COMMITS NOT A

80
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,342
PARTISAN ISSUE.

81
00:02:02,342 --> 00:02:03,510
THERE IS NOTHING POLITICAL ABOUT

82
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,777
IT.

83
00:02:03,777 --> 00:02:05,379
I HAD TO STOP READING THEM

84
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:06,046
BECAUSE THEY ARE SO HORRIFIC

85
00:02:06,046 --> 00:02:06,747
THAT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

86
00:02:06,747 --> 00:02:11,552
HERE DOING HARM TO INNOCENT

87
00:02:11,552 --> 00:02:11,952
INDIVIDUALS.

88
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:14,555
IS IT SOMETHING THAT CAN COME TO

89
00:02:14,555 --> 00:02:15,589
A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION?

90
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:17,357
THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT

91
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:17,858
LOOPHOLES TODAY.

92
00:02:17,858 --> 00:02:18,859
THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL

93
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:19,593
TALKED ABOUT LOOPHOLES TODAY.

94
00:02:19,593 --> 00:02:21,728
IS THERE ENOUGH, AT LEAST AT

95
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:22,830
THIS POINT, MOTIVATION ON

96
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,997
CAPITOL HILL TO GET SOMETHING

97
00:02:23,997 --> 00:02:24,998
DONE?

98
00:02:24,998 --> 00:02:26,800
TO GO OUR WHATEVER

99
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,835
PRESIDENT TRUMP OPPOSES,

100
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:28,535
DEMOCRATS SEEM IN LOCKSTEP TO AT

101
00:02:28,535 --> 00:02:28,569
DEMOCRATS SEEM IN LOCKSTEP TO AC

102
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:28,802
DEMOCRATS SEEM IN LOCKSTEP TO AK

103
00:02:28,802 --> 00:02:31,805
HIM, THEY SAY NO.

104
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:33,407
BY HAVING HIS HEARING TODAY, THE

105
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:34,575
MEETING TODAY, IT DRIVES HOME TO

106
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:36,844
THE PUBLIC HOW EVIL THESE PEOPLE

107
00:02:36,844 --> 00:02:37,978
ARE.

108
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:39,379
THAT COULD CAUSE ENOUGH

109
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:40,113
DEMOCRATS TO REALIZE IT'S TIME

110
00:02:40,113 --> 00:02:42,015
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

111
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:42,816
THEY CAN ARGUE WITH

112
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,517
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON A MILLION

113
00:02:43,517 --> 00:02:45,686
OTHER ISSUES BUT THIS SHOULD NOT

114
00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:48,388
BE IN ANY WAY A PARTISAN ISSUE.

115
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:50,157
IT'S A HUMAN ISSUE, AN AMERICAN

116
00:02:50,157 --> 00:02:50,457
ISSUE.

117
00:02:50,457 --> 00:02:51,792
THANK GOD FOR THE PRESIDENT FOR

118
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:53,961
WHAT HE'S DOING TODAY.

119
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:54,995
IF YOU, IF OTHERS COULD HAVE

120
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:57,998
SEEN PEOPLE IN THE ROOM TODAY.

121
00:02:57,998 --> 00:02:59,633
I AM SURE VERY FEW OF THEM ARE

122
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:00,367
REGISTERED REPUBLICANS BUT THEY

123
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:02,569
WERE CHEERING FOR

124
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:03,537
PRESIDENT TRUMP OR WHAT HE WAS

125
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:03,971
DOING.

126
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:05,372
THEY WANT THE POLICE TO BE DOING

127
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:05,672
MORE.

128
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:07,574
THE POLICE ARE DOING A GREAT

129
00:03:07,574 --> 00:03:08,175
JOB.

130
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:08,809
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT POLICE

131
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:10,210
BRUTALITY AND PEOPLE BEING

132
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,311
ARRESTED, THOSE PEOPLE TODAY,

133
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:13,413
THEY WANT THE POLICE TO BE MORE

134
00:03:13,413 --> 00:03:13,814
AGGRESSIVE.

135
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:14,548
>> Shannon: SOMETHING THAT HAS

136
00:03:14,548 --> 00:03:18,585
BEEN PARTISAN IN NATURE AND

137
00:03:18,585 --> 00:03:20,153
TOMORROW WILL BE BIPARTISAN IS

138
00:03:20,153 --> 00:03:21,221
THE MEETING THAT INVOLVES THE

139
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:23,423
DOJ AND LAWMAKERS.

140
00:03:23,423 --> 00:03:24,992
WE KNOW THE SECOND MEETING IS

141
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:25,792
GOING TO BE BIPARTISAN.

142
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:26,894
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?

143
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:29,763
HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE, YOU ARE A

144
00:03:29,763 --> 00:03:30,097
MEMBER.

145
00:03:30,097 --> 00:03:31,965
WHAT YOU HOPE WILL BE REVEALED

146
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:32,332
TOMORROW?

147
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:36,036
>> IF TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

148
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:36,970
ENUNCIATION STARTED?

149
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,805
WHAT WAS THE BASIS OF THE FISA

150
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:40,374
APPLICATIONS?

151
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:42,075
WHEN DID THE FBI FIRST LEARN, AS

152
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:43,277
THEY CLAIM NOW, THAT SOMETHING

153
00:03:43,277 --> 00:03:45,412
WAS GOING WRONG.

154
00:03:45,412 --> 00:03:46,547
I'VE EXAMINED EVERYTHING I

155
00:03:46,547 --> 00:03:46,980
POSSIBLY CAN.

156
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,649
I SEE NO EVIDENCE OF ANY

157
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:49,216
COLLUSION ANYWHERE.

158
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:51,985
I DON'T SEE ANY BASIS FOR THIS

159
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:52,786
INVESTIGATION BEING STARTED.

160
00:03:52,786 --> 00:03:53,854
MAYBE THE FBI AND JUSTICE

161
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:54,721
DEPARTMENT HAVE SOMETHING TO

162
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:56,924
SHOW THE GANG OF EIGHT TOMORROW.

163
00:03:56,924 --> 00:04:00,093
HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW THEM BUT

164
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:00,661
IT HASN'T BEEN THERE.

165
00:04:00,661 --> 00:04:02,229
THEY GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO

166
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:03,230
EITHER BLOCK IT CAN MAKE IT

167
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:03,597
DIFFICULT.

168
00:04:03,597 --> 00:04:05,599
FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING OR

169
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,300
WHAT HAPPENED OR WHAT CAUSED

170
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,200
THEM TO START THIS

171
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,634
INVESTIGATION.

172
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:10,671
IT WASN'T JUST A POLITICAL HIT

173
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:10,938
JOB.

174
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:12,873
WAS IT PEOPLE LIVING IN THEIR

175
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:15,609
OWN SILO?

176
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:16,910
I HAVEN'T PRACTICED LAW IN A

177
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,077
WHILE BUT I'LL SEE ANY BASIS

178
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:19,579
HERE FOR THE INVESTIGATION EVEN

179
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:20,180
BEING STARTED.

180
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,180
NEVER MIND GOING ON THERE FOR A

181
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,748
YEAR AND HALF.

182
00:04:21,748 --> 00:04:22,849
>> Shannon: DO YOU THINK IS

183
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:24,017
HELPFUL DEMOCRATS WILL BE

184
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:26,954
INCLUDED IN THE SECOND MEETING?

185
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:28,822
DOES IT DEFUSE THE PARTISANSHIP?

186
00:04:28,822 --> 00:04:31,091
>> YOU WOULD HOPE SO BUT THE

187
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:32,626
FACT IS DEMOCRATS COULD'VE BEEN

188
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:33,627
ASKING FOR THIS INFORMATION ALL

189
00:04:33,627 --> 00:04:34,394
ALONG.

190
00:04:34,394 --> 00:04:35,062
IT WAS DEVIN NUNES AND TREY

191
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:36,196
