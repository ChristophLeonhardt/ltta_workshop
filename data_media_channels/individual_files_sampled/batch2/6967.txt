recently Scott Pruett was speaking to local reporters in Las Vegas about the issue of climate change as we know Pruitt is the head of the EPA and unfortunately does not believe that climate change poses a risk to humanity and so when he was asked about those controversial views here's what he had to say now keep in mind by the way that Pruitt used to deny that climate change existed he used to deny that climate change was caused by human behavior but he's changing his tune he's pivoting to a different talking point now that I want you to pay close attention to he said I think there's assumptions made that because the climate is warming that that necessarily is a bad thing okay is it an existential threat is it something that is unsustainable or what kind of affect or harm is this going to have we know that humans have most flourished during times of what warming trends Wow okay so I don't know which period of time he's referring to when temperatures increased to the point where you have ice caps melting sea levels rising extreme weather conditions happening extreme drought impacting certain parts certain regions of the world including Southern California by the way which leads to extreme wildfire seasons I mean we're at windows I know he doesn't know I mean this is his you know Pro oil industry talking point BS that is incredibly dangerous especially when you consider the fact that the EPA still under his leadership does believe that climate change poses a risk the Pentagon believes that climate change will be a national security nightmare because of the fact that agriculture is more difficult to grow there is food insecurity that has been exacerbated by climate change I mean this guy is an absolute cloud and again previously he denied that the climate was was warming previously was like no I don't know this isn't happening at all now all of a sudden he's like okay yeah so maybe it's happening but like isn't it kind of a good thing when it's hot that's exactly right I hadn't thought of that but it's kind of a valley girl thing to say from the unveil a girl guy but there are Wars that are going to be fought over this the vanishing natural resources as Anna says the agricultural belts are changing where they are on the globe water is going to be a huge issue I mean this is a vanishing resource you're seeing it played out in South Africa now and that will be something that war wars already backdoor wars are already being fought over this that is there's armed conflict over water and natural resources so he can stick his head in the ever drying sand however all he wants to but this is a this is an issue that's hitting them right in the face meantime under this guy's administration of the EPA they are dismantling his agency of course right he is seeing to the fact that the regulations minimal though they were are being lifted on everything from oil drilling to Mellon mineral exploitation in our natural in our in our national parks so this guy is is is abysmal and and evil and in abysmal and evil cabinet and he's getting help from the from the Interior Department and as I say and from all of Trump's cabinet it's a but his denial of this is is it's insane it is insane but the reality is you know he has certain corporate interests in mind during this very interview he also talked about fossil fuels and essentially defended them so we know you know we know who he's supportive of or which corporations he's supportive of even if it means sacrificing the well-being of humans in general in order to make sure that these corporations and oil companies turn a profit and last thing real quick a less code even apart from the climate change the amount of pollution and the number of different pollutants that heat Pruitt is allowing to now enter the water supply and into land into landfills and all the other ways that those pollutants get into air etc now it's it's off the chart I mean if you look at how he's undone those minimal regulations leave aside climate change pollutants themselves are as I say just off the scale in terms of entering the environment under his administration you just watch the video by the young turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
