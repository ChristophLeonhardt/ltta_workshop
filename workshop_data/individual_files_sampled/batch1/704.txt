full independence may still be a distant dream but nationalism has found a renewed voice on this island not so long ago just singing the Corsican national anthem was enough to get you beaten up by the French police here now the Islanders are demanding official status for their language the expression of cosecant roots was rapidly merged with the expression of political demands so the singing became hard for the political authorities to accept and not only the French but also some cosecant supporters of Greater France the confrontation then became violence extremely violent the brutal struggle for Corsican independence lasted for four decades before weapons were finally surrendered three years ago the political fight to the ballot box is proving much more successful a coalition of nationalists now commands 41 out of the 63 seats in the Corsican Assembly one of their key demands is for the return and amnesty of what they call their political prisoners held in jails across France what happened in the election last December was an earthquake it wasn't just the usual renewal of the assembly the Corsican people voted by an absolute majority for Corsican nationalists that's the fact the authorities in Paris have to think about the Nationalists have already served notice on President macron warning him that unless he starts listening to them then hard and conflicting times lie ahead for Paris and Corsica Corsica was the birthplace of Napoleon the man macros most often measured against in terms of his youth and grand visions the French president is due on the island next week will he choose a compromise will he defend the integrity of France at its language David chater aljazeera Corsica
