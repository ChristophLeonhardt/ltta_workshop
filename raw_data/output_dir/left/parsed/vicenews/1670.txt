dr. Rick Machado South Sudanese vice
president fled the capital juber in
December 2013 accused of trying to
foment a coup against President Salva
Kiir that was after inter-ethnic
violence broke out among Dinka and newer
tribal factions within the SPLA the
South Sudanese army since then a bush
war is taking place across the country
laying the country to waste really 2.2
million South Sudanese have fled their
homes perhaps 50,000 have been killed
perhaps more no one knows the ideas for
him to fly to Juba immediately we take
up his role as vice president time peace
agreement that's been essentially forced
and South Sudan my regional powers in
the UN
love love information when we are the
transition planning for that
well avoid I don't see a reason why I
should seek lending permission I am
going home do I need do I need a landing
permission it seems to have in the
problem at the last resort wanna yoga
when the resort now wanna go one so this
is the event that everyone's been here
for a week
pretty much hoping for waiting for final
arrival of dr. Brookman sure the
opposition leader at Gander Airport he
said there are two planes waiting and
that's been one of the many sticking
points returning to Juba he wants to fly
about today today once allowed in June
but they're sworn in as vice president
again and take up the second most
important position of authority in the
country once ago
yeah I knew and
I saw this statement yatta-mecha I've
just been informed by Cuba that
our plane cannot land in Cuba today and
will not land tomorrow so permission to
land
has been denied that's simple it gives
you stay on balance no the rocks forgot
when I want to go back to dock so that I
can wait for the time they tell me to
come back do you think the cheaper
government's wasting your time
the planet is how long are you willing
to long this game I have to go
whether it will be fixed and give it
away
hi thank you thank you think of it
vivo no gang ok ok tomorrow he doesn't
even know if we're allowed to fly Monday
he's certain for the government in Juba
essentially prolonging this
wasting everyone's time but essentially
the the Juba government don't want him
to go back to Juba to be sworn in as
vice president it's unclear how long
this and go on for tempers are praying
who wants to go back to children
