1
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,117
>> IRAN CONTINUED TO PRESERVE

2
00:00:09,117 --> 00:00:13,088
AND EXPAND ITS NUCLEAR WEAPON

3
00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:14,322
FOR FUTURE USES.

4
00:00:14,322 --> 00:00:18,760
WHY WOULD A TERRORIST REGIME

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,663
HIDE AND CATALOG SECRET NUCLEAR

6
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:23,331
FILES IF NOT TO USE THEM AT A

7
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:24,833
LATER DATE?

00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:27,602
PAUL: ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER

00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:28,937
NETANYAHU MAKING THE CASE

10
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:32,641
AGAINST THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL

11
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:33,708
CLAIMING THAT MORE THAN A

12
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,011
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOCUMENTS

13
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:37,112
SEIZED PROVED THAT THE AGREEMENT

14
00:00:37,112 --> 00:00:39,547
WAS BASED ON LINES AND TEHRAN IS

15
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:41,683
SECRETLY MAINTAINING ITS NUCLEAR

16
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:43,218
WEAPON'S PROGRAMS.

17
00:00:43,218 --> 00:00:45,820
NETANYAHU'S PRESENTATION MONDAY

18
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,222
IN TEL AVIV AHEAD OF PRESIDENT

19
00:00:47,222 --> 00:00:48,423
TRUMP'S EXPECTED DECISION NEXT

20
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,958
WEEK ON WHETHER THE U.S. WILL

21
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,994
EXIT THE ACCORD.

22
00:00:52,994 --> 00:00:53,928
PRESIDENT OF THE FOUNDATION FOR

23
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,064
DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES AND IT'S

24
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,899
GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK HERE, WHAT

25
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,168
DID WE LEARN FROM THAT

26
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:00,969
PRESENTATION BY THE PRIME

27
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:04,506
MINISTER THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW

28
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:05,140
BEFORE?

29
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,174
>> WELL, SOME OF US KNEW AND

30
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:08,143
SOME OF US DIDN'T, IT'S CLEAR

31
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:12,814
NOW THAT IRANIAN SPOKESMAN, NOT

32
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:15,784
LEAST FOREIGN MINISTER HAVE BEEN

33
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,485
LYING AND BEEN ON NUMEROUS NEWS

34
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:19,287
PROGRAMS AND ON TV SAYING, LOOK,

35
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,456
WE NEVER HAD A NUCLEAR WEAPON'S

36
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,824
PROGRAM, WE DON'T WANT A NUCLEAR

37
00:01:22,824 --> 00:01:24,326
WEAPON'S PROGRAM, SOME WOULD SAY

38
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:26,494
-- SOMETIMES THEY CLAIM IT WAS

39
00:01:26,494 --> 00:01:31,399
AGAINST IT, AND WE ARE NOT

40
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:32,334
PLANNING NUCLEAR WEAPON'S

41
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:34,135
PROGRAM FOR THE FUTURE AND ALL

42
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,604
THAT WAS SIMPLY UNTRUE, THE

43
00:01:36,604 --> 00:01:37,806
IRANIANS HAVE BEEN LIE TO GO OUR

44
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,641
FACES AND THE FACES OF THE

45
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,009
EUROPEANS ALL OF THIS TIME, THEY

46
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,510
HAD THE PLANS READY TO GO.

47
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,747
WE ALSO LEARNED FROM THIS A LOT,

48
00:01:45,747 --> 00:01:48,216
MORE TO BE REVEALED, WE HAVEN'T

49
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:49,150
TRANSLATED EVERYTHING ABOUT THE

50
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,685
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN NUCLEAR

51
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:52,053
WEAPON'S PROGRAM, THE SITES

52
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:55,390
WHERE THIS WORK WAS BEING

53
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,458
CONDUCTED AND THE EQUIPMENT THAT

54
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:59,661
WAS BEING USED, THIS RAISES A

55
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,096
LOT OF QUESTION THAT THE ATOMIC

56
00:02:01,096 --> 00:02:02,397
AGENCY NEEDS TO PURSUE.

57
00:02:02,397 --> 00:02:04,766
THEY SHOULD SAY, WE HAVE TO

58
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:05,667
INVESTIGATE AND INSPECT THE

59
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,469
SITES LIKE WE HAVE IN THE PAST,

60
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,637
WE NEED TO INTERVIEW THE

61
00:02:09,637 --> 00:02:10,672
PERSONALITIES THAT ARE INVOLVED

62
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,040
AND SEE WHAT THEY ARE UP TO NOW

63
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,575
AND WE HAVE TO KNOW WHERE THE

64
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:16,311
EQUIPMENT IS, DISMANTLED, READY

65
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:18,179
TO BE REINSTALLED.

66
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,648
ALL OF THIS NEEDS TO BE KNOWN.

67
00:02:20,648 --> 00:02:23,251
PAUL: JOHN KERRY AND SOME OF THE

68
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:26,021
ARCHITECTS OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL,

69
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,956
WE KNEW THEY STORED MOST OF IT

70
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:29,457
AND WE NEEDED TO DO THE DEAL IN

71
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:32,093
THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE WE KNEW

72
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:33,328
IRAN WE WANTED TO PURSUE NUCLEAR

73
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:35,163
WEAPON, THAT'S WHY WE NEEDED TO

74
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:36,498
CONTAIN IT WITH THE DEAL, WHAT'S

75
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:38,466
YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT?

76
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:40,635
>> MY RESPONSE TO THAT IS JOHN

77
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:43,271
CER RIRY WE CALL THE POSSIBLE

78
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:45,573
MILITARY DIMENSIONS WOULD BE

79
00:02:45,573 --> 00:02:48,176
REVEALED BY THE IRANIAN REGIME,

80
00:02:48,176 --> 00:02:50,011
THEY DIDN'T, INSTEAD WHAT WE NOW

81
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:52,447
KNOW IS THAT THEY WERE POSITIVE

82
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:53,682
MILITARY DIMENSIONS TO ALL THIS.

83
00:02:53,682 --> 00:02:58,420
YOU CANNOT HAVE INTRUSIVE

84
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,788
INSPECTION REGIME AND THAT'S

85
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:02,691
WHAT KERRY CLAIMS WE HAVE HAD

86
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:04,826
UNLESS YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T

87
00:03:04,826 --> 00:03:06,061
SAY, WELL, LET'S GO WHERE YOU

88
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:10,198
WERE PRODUCING WEAPONS, NUCLEAR

89
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:11,400
WEAPON'S TRIGGERS AND LET'S SEE

90
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,734
IF YOU'RE DOING THAT OR NOT.

91
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,469
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO INSPECT

92
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:17,072
ANY MILITARY SITES AS THOUGH

93
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,807
CRAZY IDEA MILITARY SITES WOULD

94
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:20,275
BE PLACE WHERE MILITARY WEAPONS

95
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:27,482
WOULD BE PRODUCED.

96
00:03:27,482 --> 00:03:30,218
WE CAN ASK FOR IT AND WE HAVE TO

97
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:31,753
WAIT SO THEY CAN CLEAN IT UP.

98
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,722
WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS THAT THIS

99
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:35,123
AGREEMENT NEVER STOPPED IRAN

100
00:03:35,123 --> 00:03:36,191
FROM DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS,

101
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:38,727
IT MAY, MAY HAVE DELAYED IT IN

102
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:40,295
SOME RESPECTS BUT THAT'S NOT

103
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:41,997
EVEN CLEAR.

104
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:43,832
THE IRANIAN PLAN, WE KNOW, I

105
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:45,834
THINK, FROM THIS INFORMATION IS

106
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,669
TO GET THEIR ECONOMY BACK IN

107
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,337
SHAPE THROUGH THE LIFTING OF

108
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:51,173
SANCTIONS AND THEY'VE GOTTEN

109
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:52,541
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM US AND

110
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,010
THEN AT A TIME OF THEIR CHOOSING

111
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,078
GO AHEAD, DEVELOP NUCLEAR

112
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:57,446
WEAPONS WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN

113
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,281
THEIR INTENTION EVEN AS THEY'VE

114
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,649
DENIED IT.

115
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:02,184
PAUL: THE PRESIDENT FACES A BIG

116
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:03,852
DECISION NEXT WEEK AND HE'S BEEN

117
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:05,854
NEGOTIATING, HIS ADMINISTRATION

118
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:07,222
HAS BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH EUROPE

119
00:04:07,222 --> 00:04:08,757
TO GET TO A COMMON GROUND

120
00:04:08,757 --> 00:04:10,058
WHETHER TO REVISE THE DEAL, AT

121
00:04:10,058 --> 00:04:11,493
LEAST AGREE FROM THIS END, THE

122
00:04:11,493 --> 00:04:13,795
WESTERN POWERS TO REVISE THE

123
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,430
DEAL, HOW CLOSE ARE THEY?

124
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,868
ARE THEY MAKING PROGRESS ON AN

125
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:20,302
AGREEMENT?

126
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,636
>> PROBABLY NOT.

127
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,171
I THINK TWO POSSIBILITIES, ONE

128
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:24,673
IS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL

129
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:25,874
TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT.

130
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:28,610
PAUL: RIGHT.

131
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,580
>> FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL

132
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,582
MACRON AND CHANCELLOR ANGELA

133
00:04:33,582 --> 00:04:34,549
MERKEL CAME TO WASHINGTON AND

134
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:38,754
TRY TO CONVINCE HIM OTHERWISE.

135
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:39,688
MACRON SAYS I DON'T THINK THAT

136
00:04:39,688 --> 00:04:40,289
WE DID.

137
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:41,690
THE OTHER POSSIBILITY IS THAT HE

138
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,191
DECIDES NOT TO TERMINATE FOR NOW

139
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:44,426
BUT TO DO A COUPLE OF THINGS,

140
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:46,428
ONE IS TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS

141
00:04:46,428 --> 00:04:48,864
OUTSIDE OF THE NUCLEAR

142
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:50,999
FRAMEWORK, SANCTIONS ON

143
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,234
TERRORISM, SANCTIONS ON THE

144
00:04:52,234 --> 00:04:53,468
MISSILE PROGRAM AND THESE ARE

145
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:55,270
MISSILES MEANT TO CARRY NUCLEAR

146
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,371
WEAPONS, BY THE WAY, SANCTIONS

147
00:04:56,371 --> 00:00:00,000
ON A BUNCH OF THINGS, SANCTION
