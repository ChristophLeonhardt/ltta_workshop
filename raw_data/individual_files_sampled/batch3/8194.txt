PRESIDENT OF THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT ASSOCIATE IN AN MARK STEYN TO DISCUSS WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT IT MEANS. BUT FIRST, OVER THE PAST MONTH, A CARAVAN OF CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS HAS GRADUALLY MADE IT UP TO HONDURAS TO MEXICO ALL THE WAY TO TIJUANA, OPPOSITE SAN DIEGO. AT ONE POINT MAKE SKIN AUTHORITIES CLAIM THEY BROKE UP AND AMERICAN MEDIA DUTIFULLY REPORTED THEY DID. THEY DIDN'T. THAT WAS A P.R. GESTURE AND A TEMPORARY ONE. IN FACT, DURING PART OF THE TRIP, MEXICAN POLICE ESCORTED THE MIGRANTS NORTHWARD. IN OTHER WORDS, THE MEXICAN MIGRANTS ABETTED ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION INTO THIS COUNTRY AS IT'S DONE FOR MANY YEARS. TONIGHT, THE CARAVAN IS ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. RATHER THAN WAIT FOR THE CROSSING STATION TO OPEN, MANY OF THEM JUMPED THE FENCE. SOME WAVED HONDURAN FLAGS WHEN THEY GOT TO THE TOP. THAT TELLS YOU EVERYTHING. WHEN YOU ARRIVE IN A COUNTRY TO CONTRIBUTE TO IT AND ASSIMILATE INTO ITS CULTURE, DON'T WAVE THE FLAG OF A FOREIGN NATION. THAT'S WHEN YOU DO IN TRIUMPH WHEN YOU INVADE A COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO BORDER CONTROL, AT LEAST ONE MEMBER OF THE CARAVAN HAS A READY ADMITTED TO BEING A MEMBER OF MS-13. ALL OF THAT SHOULD WORRY US. THERE'S ONLY A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THIS CARAVAN, BUT THERE ARE BILLIONS MORE AROUND THE WORLD WHO LIVED AMID VIOLENCE AND POVERTY IN VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WOULD LIKE TO RELOCATE TO SAN DIEGO. THE LEFT ARGUES WE HAVE NO MORAL RIGHT TO STOP ANY OF THEM FROM DOING THAT. HERE IS TURNING TO A NICKEL RAMUS OF TIJUANA DANCING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AS CRIMINAL FOR TRYING TO ENFORCE OUR OWN FEDERAL LAW. WATCH. THE METHOD FOR BORDER PROTECTION, STOP REJECTING ASYLUM-SEEKERS WHO TRY TO PRESENT THEMSELVES AS A PORT OF ENTRY. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. YOU KNOW YOU TURN PEOPLE AWAY. YOU COMPLAIN THEY ARE BREAKING THE LAW BY ENTERING ILLEGALLY. YOU ARE BREAKING THE LAW AND YOU ARE FORCING THEM TO BREAK THE LAW. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE CARAVANS. Tucker: SOMETHING YOU DEFTLY WANT SOMEONE TO CONTROL, SCREAMING IN A BULLHORN. THIS IS NOT IMMIGRATION. IMMIGRATION HAPPENS WITH THE CONSENT OF THE HOST COUNTRY. THIS IS HAPPENING BY FORCE WITHOUT OUR CONSENT. A GOVERNMENT THAT CARES ABOUT ITS OWN CITIZENS WOULDN'T ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN. BAD THINGS HAPPEN WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR HOME AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. THE LEFT IS DEMANDING WE LEAVE OUR DOOR OPEN. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE AMAZING PEOPLE. THEY SAY FAR BETTER THAN YOU ARE, MR. ENTITLED AMERICAN. THAT'S THE CONVERSATION WITH HENRIQUE AZEVEDO OF UNIVISION AND HE MADE THAT POINT. IF YOU ARE RIGHT UP AGAINST A COUNTRY TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL AS PEOPLE ARE SHOOTING EACH OTHER IN THE NUMBERS YOU JUST DESCRIBED, WHY WOULDN'T YOU BE TERRIFIED TO LET THEM IN? I THINK YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE CRIMINALS. YOU ARE GETTING THE BEST OF MEXICO, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO WORK 2-3 SHIFTS A DAY, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS B1 HOW DO WE KNOW THAT? THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FLEEING THE VIOLENCE, THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE GETTING.
