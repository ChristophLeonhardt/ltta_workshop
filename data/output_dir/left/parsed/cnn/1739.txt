- I was fresh out of undergrad
when I was diagnosed with cancer.
I was being treated in
a children's hospital,
so I kind of stuck out.
You can tell they're just kind of curious
why you're there, and that kind of
sets up the stage for that shared feeling
we have as young adults
that are diagnosed.
You kind of struggle to
find where you fit in.

- First Descents is a non-profit
that provides free outdoor adventures
to young adults affected by cancer.
Nature's a very objective place,
it doesn't care whether
or not you've had cancer.
And so, it's an incredible
creator of community.
We start to see them realize that they're
not the only person facing these
challenges that cancer presented.
- I came to my First Descents program
four months after I finished treatment,
and it was like the first moment
that I just basically didn't feel
like I was completely helpless and broken.
- Coming here during treatment
and finding people that were around
my same age, and who could relate
was the most powerful thing.
- You know, if you're
talking to your friends
it's kind of weird if you're like,
"I don't know if I'll be
able to have children,
"and I don't know when I should talk to
"people about this when I go on a date."
But having all of you guys, I can
just casually mention stuff like that,
and you're like, "Oh yeah
(laughter), totally."

- Since becoming a CNN Hero,
and since getting that Subaru grant,
we've expanded into most of the
major cities around the country.
The most exciting thing for me
is to bring these programs into local
communities around the country,
and to actually weave outdoor adventure
into their life post-diagnosis.
- As young adults,
when you're diagnosed
with cancer, you're going through
so many defining moments in your life.
Like building your identity, and when
your identity is heavily defined
by that cancer experience, First Descents
kind of helps you break that mold.
Now with support from Subaru
we get together as a community
and we don't have to define our lives
through that cancer experience.
