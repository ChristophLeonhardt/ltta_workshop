162
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:46,989
ACCEPT THIS IS THE WAY THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS AND CHALK IT UP

163
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,891
PRESIDENT SPEAKS AND CHALK IT UP TO NOTHING, ONE OF OUR CRAZY

164
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:51,527
TO NOTHING, ONE OF OUR CRAZY UNCLES SAID WE LOOK LIKE A HOT

165
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:52,561
UNCLES SAID WE LOOK LIKE A HOT BISCUIT ON THANKSGIVING.

166
00:04:52,562 --> 00:04:53,562
BISCUIT ON THANKSGIVING. IT’S LIKE THAT THOUGH.

167
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:56,499
IT’S LIKE THAT THOUGH. WE’RE LAUGHING BUT THAT IS WHAT

168
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:59,469
WE’RE LAUGHING BUT THAT IS WHAT WE’RE TALK ABOUT ZBLG THE WAY --

169
00:04:59,503 --> 00:05:02,305
WE’RE TALK ABOUT ZBLG THE WAY -- >> THE WAY THE PRESIDENT TALKS

170
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:05,574
>> THE WAY THE PRESIDENT TALKS GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO HIS

171
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:05,908
GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO HIS CANDIDACY.

172
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:07,243
CANDIDACY. THEY’RE AWARE HE WILL TALK ABOUT

173
00:05:07,277 --> 00:05:08,511
THEY’RE AWARE HE WILL TALK ABOUT WOMEN IN THE KIND OF TERMS YOU

174
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:10,580
WOMEN IN THE KIND OF TERMS YOU WOULD USE TO TALK ABOUT PEOPLE

175
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:12,915
WOULD USE TO TALK ABOUT PEOPLE IN LESS POLITICALLY SIGNIFICANT

176
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,215
IN LESS POLITICALLY SIGNIFICANT ROLES.

177
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:16,553
ROLES. THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE WHO

178
00:05:16,587 --> 00:05:18,321
THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT TRUMP, PEOPLE IN HIS

179
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:19,389
SUPPORT TRUMP, PEOPLE IN HIS ORBIT, PEOPLE WORKING FOR HIM

00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:21,524
ORBIT, PEOPLE WORKING FOR HIM KNOW THIS IS THE WAY HE TALKS

181
00:05:21,558 --> 00:05:21,958
KNOW THIS IS THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT WOMEN.

182
00:05:21,992 --> 00:05:23,192
ABOUT WOMEN. THE PEOPLE IN HIS ORBIT, IT’S

183
00:05:23,193 --> 00:05:23,526
THE PEOPLE IN HIS ORBIT, IT’S BAKED IN.

184
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
BAKED IN. IT’S NOT A SURPRISE.

185
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:25,795
IT’S NOT A SURPRISE. HE’S ACTING WITHIN HIS

186
00:05:25,796 --> 00:05:26,129
HE’S ACTING WITHIN HIS ARCHITECT.

187
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:28,298
ARCHITECT. WE KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE

188
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:28,731
WE KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE PRESIDENT.

189
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:29,932
PRESIDENT. >> BRET, IS THIS NIKKI HALEY’S

190
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,368
>> BRET, IS THIS NIKKI HALEY’S JOB TO LOSE?

191
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:33,136
JOB TO LOSE? ARE THERE OTHER NAMES WE HAVEN’T

192
00:05:33,137 --> 00:05:33,736
ARE THERE OTHER NAMES WE HAVEN’T THOUGHT OF.

193
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:36,138
THOUGHT OF. I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID

194
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,042
I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE’S HAPPY WITH GRENELL IN

195
00:05:39,043 --> 00:05:39,409
HE’S HAPPY WITH GRENELL IN GERMANY.

196
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:41,010
GERMANY. >> YOU KNOW, LOOK, I DON’T KNOW.

197
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:44,046
>> YOU KNOW, LOOK, I DON’T KNOW. CLEARLY HE TALKED ABOUT HAVING

198
00:05:44,048 --> 00:05:44,447
CLEARLY HE TALKED ABOUT HAVING FIVE NAMES.

199
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:46,115
FIVE NAMES. >> WE HAVEN’T HEARD ANY OF THEM

200
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,150
>> WE HAVEN’T HEARD ANY OF THEM BESIDES DINA’S.

201
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:48,084
BESIDES DINA’S. >> DINA WOULD BE A TERRIFIC

202
00:05:48,118 --> 00:05:50,253
>> DINA WOULD BE A TERRIFIC CHOICE FOR THE REASONS I JUST

203
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:50,620
CHOICE FOR THE REASONS I JUST MENTIONED.

204
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:53,055
MENTIONED. RICK GRENELL IS ALSO A STRONG

205
00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:53,857
RICK GRENELL IS ALSO A STRONG CHOICE BECAUSE HE’S CLOSE TO THE

206
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:54,757
CHOICE BECAUSE HE’S CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT, HE’S BEEN AT THE

207
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,559
PRESIDENT, HE’S BEEN AT THE U.N., HE WORKED FOR JOHN BOLTON

208
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,129
U.N., HE WORKED FOR JOHN BOLTON AT THE U.N. FOR MANY YEARS,

209
00:06:00,164 --> 00:06:02,065
AT THE U.N. FOR MANY YEARS, OTHER U.N. AMBASSADORS, FIRST

210
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:04,167
OTHER U.N. AMBASSADORS, FIRST OPENLY GAY AMERICAN AMBASSADOR

211
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:04,934
OPENLY GAY AMERICAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS, THAT

212
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:05,969
TO THE UNITED NATIONS, THAT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT AS WELL.

213
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,270
WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT AS WELL. THERE ARE A FEW OTHER NAMES I

214
00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:08,471
THERE ARE A FEW OTHER NAMES I CAN IMAGINE THE PRESIDENT

215
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:08,938
CAN IMAGINE THE PRESIDENT CHOOSING FROM.

216
00:06:08,973 --> 00:06:10,273
CHOOSING FROM. >> WHAT DIFFERENT DOES IT MAKE?

217
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:11,708
>> WHAT DIFFERENT DOES IT MAKE? BECAUSE HE SHOOTS FROM THE HIP

218
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:12,075
BECAUSE HE SHOOTS FROM THE HIP ANYWAY.

219
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:13,343
ANYWAY. EVEN IF ALL THESE PEOPLE -- MANY

220
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:14,244
EVEN IF ALL THESE PEOPLE -- MANY OF THEM ARE QUALIFIED.

221
00:06:14,245 --> 00:06:15,578
OF THEM ARE QUALIFIED. I WOULD WONDER, IF I WAS THAT

222
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:17,280
I WOULD WONDER, IF I WAS THAT QUALIFIED, AS MAYBE TINA OR

223
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:18,882
QUALIFIED, AS MAYBE TINA OR RICHARD, WOULD I WANT THAT KIND

224
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:20,751
RICHARD, WOULD I WANT THAT KIND OF JOB WHERE I COULD BE

225
00:06:20,785 --> 00:06:22,953
OF JOB WHERE I COULD BE SUPERCEDED AND TALKED OVER AND

226
00:06:22,954 --> 00:06:23,286
SUPERCEDED AND TALKED OVER AND UNDERCUT?

227
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:24,788
UNDERCUT? >> IT’S A UNIQUE POSITION --

228
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:26,256
>> IT’S A UNIQUE POSITION -- >> PEOPLE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL

229
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,490
>> PEOPLE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE UNITED NATIONS

230
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:29,425
OF THE UNITED NATIONS BUREAUCRACY HAVE TOLD ME HOW

231
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,493
BUREAUCRACY HAVE TOLD ME HOW GRATEFUL THEY HAVE BEEN TO NIKKI

232
00:06:30,495 --> 00:06:32,062
GRATEFUL THEY HAVE BEEN TO NIKKI HALEY FOR PROVIDING A BRIDGE AND

233
00:06:32,063 --> 00:06:33,997
HALEY FOR PROVIDING A BRIDGE AND OFFERING THE KIND OF QUIET

234
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:34,431
OFFERING THE KIND OF QUIET DIPLOMACY --

235
00:06:34,465 --> 00:06:37,067
DIPLOMACY -- >> DINA IS IN THE UNIQUE

236
00:06:37,068 --> 00:00:00,000
