1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,020
At the wedding of Prince William and
Kate Middleton, two things stuck out.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,500
Literally.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,840
The fascinators of princesses
Beatrice and Eugenie.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:10,740
Sure, they were

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,089
gigantic and pretty outlandish, but to be
fair the princesses were just following

6
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:16,020
the dress code.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,840
And on the wedding
invitations to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding,

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,560
you'll notice the same
thing.

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,120
You got to wear a hat.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,240
Since the sixties, formal hats have sort of faded
out of fashion.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,600
Hats have always served multiple functions.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,059
They protect
us from the cold and the Sun, they're

13
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,340
symbols of religion or trade or military
station.

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,710
Or in the case of the top hat,

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,240
they can show how stylish you are.

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,420
There's a really popular story that the

17
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,059
first time a guy wore a top hat in
London, it caused such a stir that a

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,200
woman fainted, dogs yelped, and a kid broke
his arm in a mob.

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,980
This probably didn't happen.

20
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,390
But it is true that top hats
weren't really a thing in the UK until the

21
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,460
early 19th century.

22
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,350
Beau Brummell, a
fashion-forward dandy introduced them to

23
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,980
his friend and future king, George IV, and top hats officially received royal approval.

24
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,800
Brummell was a big hat
guy and he's also responsible for the

25
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,380
decadent fashions you see at places like
this.

26
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,610
That's the Royal Ascot, the biggest

27
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,380
race of the London social season.

28
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,140
In 1807, it introduced the Gold Cup, a shorter

29
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,920
race that brought larger crowds.

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,979
It was around this time that Brummell

31
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,159
introduced a strict dress code for the
race, so that even those from lower

32
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,880
social classes looked the part.

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,540
Including Eliza Doolittle.

34
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,200
Come on. Come on Dover.

35
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,560
Come on Dover! Move your bloomin' arse!

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,740
I suppose historically people have worn
hats to the to the races again,

37
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,380
because of that formality.

38
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,670
Nowadays, you
know, women like to dress up. So if

39
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,480
they're going to the races it's a
fantastic excuse to to wear a hat.

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,710
That's Rachel Trevor Morgan who's made
more than 80 hats for Queen Elizabeth II,

41
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,840
including those she's worn to Royal
Ascot.

42
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,430
Brummell's dress code, now known as

43
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,120
"Morning Dress," was the direct inspiration
for races like this one.

44
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,340
And it also

45
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,670
became the de facto style of dress for all
high society events held in the daytime.

46
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,720
Meanwhile women's hats ebbed and flowed
according to fashion trends at court.

47
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,340
Bonnets in the early Victorian period,
followed by tall ornamental hats, and

48
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,980
then elaborate Edwardian creations with
enormous brims.

49
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,100
At the end of the 19th century,

50
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,920
we had women wearing hats all
the time. They'd always go out wearing a hat.

51
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,560
After World War II the traditional
social season began to decline, as

52
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,780
aristocrats abandoned their London homes.

53
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,970
But morning dress still remained ,most

54
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,280
notably at horse races and weddings.

55
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,010
I think there was a definite shift in hat

56
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:53,540
wearing in the 1960s and I suppose it's
because fashions became a bit more casual.

57
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,740
I think the young were
experimenting with more exciting hairdos

58
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,340
you know, you had beehive haircuts and
people piling their hair up and then

59
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,820
really short sharp cuts

60
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,940
and somehow it
was left to the older generation to

61
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,820
carry on that hat wearing, I think.

62
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,840
Hats were still, of course, required at the

63
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,940
fanciest events for the fanciest people.

64
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,500
Which is why hats tend to peak in

65
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,220
popularity around the same time as
royals do.

66
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,120
When Kate and William got

67
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,200
married there was definitely an upsurge
in hat wearing.

68
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,320
People looked at

69
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,220
everybody attending the service and all
the wonderful creations they had and

70
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,460
they wanted a part of that.

71
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,900
And when you
think in the 1980s and we had Princess Diana,

72
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,480
who always looked so beautiful and
always wore hats and think of the Queen.

73
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,900
She's a great hat wearer so I, you
know, I think it really does affect people.

74
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,460
And that's maybe the real reason
why we associate British Royals with hats.

75
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,659
Whenever we see them, it's likely
because there's a big event going on and

76
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:47,300
for Royals, big events mean hats.

77
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,790
People might want to wear a hat to stand out

78
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,940
and because they're quite an extrovert,

79
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,569
or they might want to wear a hat in

80
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:55,460
order to sort of slightly hide behind.

81
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,049
And there are those people who've

82
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:00,950
never worn hats and feel very awkward
about the whole thing, but it's really

83
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,600
satisfying when people come back saying,

84
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,340
"that was fantastic I really enjoyed it and had a great, positive experience."

85
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,370
So you can read quite a lot into people and

86
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,220
it's getting to know where their comfort
zone is.

87
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,650
But they're a great sort of

88
00:04:15,650 --> 00:00:00,000
extension of people's characters I think.
