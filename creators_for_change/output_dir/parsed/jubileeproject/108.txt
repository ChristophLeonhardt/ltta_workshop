I've always wanted to drive across the
country
I just never thought I'd quit my job to
do it let me back up as long as I can
remember I wanted to make films tell
stories but having traditional parents
that wasn't safe for them you know the
meme that goes hey dad I want to be an
actor and he says son it's pronounced
doctor that was my life so I took the
traditional route and studied computer
science on the side I made films tried
to make a difference but ultimately I
took the job that every parent can brag
about at dinner parties coming out of
college I took a job thinking I would
change the world
hell I thought I was the change at the
beginning I made the most of every day
and it was novel and exciting I was
working with interesting people and I
made it my mission to learn something
new every day
I had a spark learn innovate fail repeat
repiy
but over time things started to change
the novelty was gone and my life became
routine
I drank the same coffee made the same
calls took the same route to work
each day was a copy of itself
one day while I was working I came
across this design website and had a
list rules life rules I started reading
them
rule number two 33 never so rule
number 168 make a difference
roll number 205 get in over your
head
roll number 58 lose your ego
those rules echoed back to me every day
since I read them
my whole life I tried to live by those
rules now I have broken every
one
when I first started working I thought
it was gonna make a difference and now I
realized I was just another employee
another number
I didn't want to wake up at the end of
my career realizing that all I did was
survive just another drop in the bucket
who went along to pay off his mortgage I
sued dead
so I finally did it I packed my stuff
close out my projects and gave my notice
I quit
trust me it's much easier said than done
honestly I'm not looking to be happy
some days I'm miserable and aching
but I'm interested
and that's where it's living forward
as I Drive across the country I'm going
places far outside my comfort places
I've never heard
small towns with people there countless
stories
landscapes I never knew existed
sunrises and sunsets
I sleep in the car on the road in $20
motels
I'm breathing air so fresh it makes my
heart race
at times it's grueling and I love every
moment out
I've always wanted to tell stories about
real people that changed lives and I'm
gonna do just that
my name is Tamra Siobhan and I'm not to
tell the stories of those who are
finding their own way the ones who have
swam upstream for what they believe in
the ones who left a life of safety for
something greater the ones who were cast
aside only to make their own path the
innovators the trendsetters some might
call them the crazy
