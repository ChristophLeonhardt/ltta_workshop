it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the culture difference or</font>

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,000
just general happenings which<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,120
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy but uh there was one that</font>

she doesn't talk like that but she's in

28
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the generic American accent there and</font>

29
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,020
she went but ah mighty wedding cake I

30
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,900
know it just annoyed me and it's just

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">funny the fact there was this sort of</font>

32
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">like arrogant nature of like I wasn't</font>

33
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,810
good enough to be served because I

34
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't speaking English properly when we</font>

35
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,439
all know where the English language

36
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,070
originated from I'm not criticizing the

37
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,350
American language but when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

38
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,850
think you're going somewhere and you

39
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,810
were speaking true<font color="#E5E5E5"> English and then you</font>

40
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,780
get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was just surreal to me but</font>

41
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,460
she didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> speak much English but I mean</font>

42
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,460
fair play to work for taking the role of

43
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,229
something that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be seen in some</font>

44
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:58,950
really bad teen movie hey so I was

45
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> women alien who served</font>

46
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,390
us

47
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,710
what did she<font color="#E5E5E5"> say what there we go maybe</font>

48
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,600
I did exaggerate a little bit but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

49
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">just doing it for comical valley but</font>
