ladies and gentlemen here we go again breaking news Republican Duncan Hunter has been indicted along with his wife here we are yet ladies and gentlemen we got him not exactly yet he's just indicted so this is the third massive could be a conviction or indictment today that affects Republicans so hunter is indicted mana for got convicted today and Michael Cohen pleaded guilty so and this is all happening all of the same time they are breaking all records on corruption so you're going to love some of these details and what he misuses can't pay money for for those details Kaspar yes yes so first how much money from his campaign was allegedly misused charges related to the misuse of $250,000 these are funds for his campaign so what did he spend it on so uh an Italian vacation dental work purchases at a surf shop huge tabs at bars and restaurants in San Diego and Washington DC and then my personal favorite airfare for a pet rabbit to fly with the family oh come on come on it's over come on look this is the 50th district of California it's actually a very conservative district his daddy used to represent and he represents it now he's got passed down to him like he's royalty I thought we didn't have royalty in this country part of the reason we were I was opposed to the Clintons etc right so now Duncan or jr. comes in $250,000 okay that's not a small mess these out y'all man ecology me and my wife we just slipped up we just used the wrong credit card in there no $250,000 it's not here and there okay and if you want to fly your pet rabbit at a great expense at you're off your own money but you slipped up and you need a creditor prosecutors are not going to go after a sitting congressman and his wife it will if it was a simple error that they corrected a couple of days later no this was repeated you get it over and over and over again until he got caught yes so okay so again quarter-million dollars and then the Justice Department law launches an investigation and so what I love is how he immediately throws his wife under the bus Oh his wife campaign manager so he says no no no this is a misunderstanding it was thug my campaign manager and my wife they they keep using the wrong credit card okay but if you knew that they were using the wrong wedding wrong credit card for these large amounts of money then why wouldn't you immediately reimburse right in and he didn't reimburse until the investigation began at that point his campaign did reimburse about $65,000 but again that was when the Federal Election Commission first questioned the spending on video games in 2016 so this has been an ongoing investigation apparently there's enough evidence to indict him and you know maybe Donald Trump was right maybe he is draining the swamp because ever since he got elected more Republicans have been either convicted or indicted or have pled guilty to all sorts of criminal activity yeah maybe his secret brilliant strategy askew and on about this was that hey I will just let all of these corrupt people come out of the closet including everyone that works for me right because they think hey it's open season nobody's paying attention we elected a criminal like Donald Trump I guess we could all break the law right and they will NAB them all no no no the fish rots from the head down okay so but it's not just about Trump okay the Republican Party has been taking donor money and a lot of the Democratic Party too but the Republican Party is nearly 100% corrupt at the national level they've made an art form out of taking money from their donors and and then doing their bidding so are we really surprised when they take it a little extra step and go hey it's nice that they're funding all my campaigns and giving me power and wealth and privilege why don't I just take some of the money I mean I got a pet rabbit who's gotta fly I mean we're going to an Italian vacation you expect me not to take my rabbit right so let me just put some of it in my pocket besides which nobody ever does anything about it we get all this money from all these donors and the FE C's asleep at the wheel and are they really gonna notice if I just put it in my pocket so I'm a little surprised that they did notice so credit to the authorities here into law enforcement for following the law and enforcing it here so he's in a world of trouble by the way he has at justice Democrat running against them so um our company jar is an excellent candidate and they said he had no chance they had a bunch of corporatist democrats who take corporate PAC money like Duncan Hunter does running against him he's like hold my beer okay and so what he did was he out raised all of his Democrats that were taking corporate back money even though he doesn't take it and then he out Rhys Duncan Hunter all those small dollar donations so here comes Oh mark open a jar by the way if you want to find out more about him comp a campaign com so wouldn't it be awesome if a Justice Democrat who's totally uncorrupted takes the seat of Duncan Hunter well the most conservative guys in the house who's so corrupted he got indicted by the federal government today that would be perfect justice let's go make that happen never miss another TYT video by ringing the bell below you'll get notified whenever we publish something new and don't forget to join TYT and download the TYT Plus
