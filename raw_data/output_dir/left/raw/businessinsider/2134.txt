short amount of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 seconds of</font>

that nice way to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cool down and</font>

stretch for me to do some stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,420
seated at your desk for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hips so you</font>

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,040
could bring your one ankle to the

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">opposite knee and then kind of sit tall</font>

12
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,309
and press out on that knee and get a

13
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:45,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of external rotation stretch</font>

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,239
out of the hip you might hold this for

15
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,500
about a minute a half two minutes each

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,260
side before switching and<font color="#E5E5E5"> once you've</font>

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,390
got both sides done we could use say

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,710
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom of the chair and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,010
is the back of it I could drop my knee

20
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,840
down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom of the chair and try</font>

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,070
to stay nice and tall this foot would

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,780
obviously be on the floor and get a nice

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,010
big stretch through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of the hip</font>

24
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,110
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that sit all day long</font>

25
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,490
tend to be pretty tight through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hips</font>

26
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,500
these are both really nice ways to spend

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,549
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of time working on opening</font>

28

<font color="#E5E5E5">up the hips you start to create a pretty</font>

big metabolic disturbance you're working

30
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,250
for twice as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're resting so</font>

31
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,750
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first round usually seems like no</font>

32
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,280
big deal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then after a round or two</font>

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,570
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> three or four you start to realize</font>
