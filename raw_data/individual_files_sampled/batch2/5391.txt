sort of this trumpian Democrat at one of his own in a leaked recording from GOP fundraiser dinner in Missouri that we played earlier Bob he's claiming that Connor Lam was actually talking about how he liked Trump and he is like Trump but we went through the litany before and let's plate well yeah I'll tell you what Bob we'll play audio and get your response we've added a trillion and a half dollars to our national debt we didn't need to add a penny to our debt to have the tax cut for our working middle-class people we now know that 85 90 % of that trillion and a half dollars went to the 1% people who earn seven eight hundred thousand dollars a year into our largest corporations it was a giveaway my opponent I both support the Second Amendment but the difference is he's called for the elimination of the background check system here in Pennsylvania I support universal background checks we need to look at putting the teeth back in the Affordable Care Act so that people have health care they can actually afford I support a woman's right to choose under the law even though I'm a Catholic and I personally oppose abortion I support medical marijuana I will refuse to allow that cut to our Medicaid program this is the proposed budget that the White House has sent to Congress and it is awaiting a vote I will vote against that sounds Bob costs to like a pretty hardcore Democrat yet Paul Ryan and a lot of other Republicans on Capitol Hill we're talking about how this guy was a conservative Connor Lam ran as a moderate Democrat but a Democrat nonetheless that there's no question about that he ran against House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said he would not vote for her in a leadership contest but what's unsettling to Republicans I've spoken to in the last 24 hours is that rick ciccone the Republican who was defeated he ran as someone who embraced the Trump image who embraced the Trump message and he was not able to survive in a district the president won by 20 percentage points just two years ago and so as Republicans look to try to survive a possible midterm storm they're wondering will the president be enough to get them over the finish line and Heidi this is also Rick's account was also a candidate that bragged about being Trump before there was even Trump that's right I think one of the most important observations here Joe is that there is a shade of gray to this argument that Connor Lam ran on some Trump issues here's what he did he co-opted the authentic version of what Trump sold on the campaign trail what Trump sold on the campaign trail in terms of his populist economic agenda is not how he's governed and so the danger here I think for all Republicans is that this working-class support for President Trump has shown to be very shallow when you have a Democrat come into an area where by the way there's still more people in this district registered as Democrats to make that populist economic argument you saw the clips there on how Connor Liam actually ran against the tax cuts he took people back to those issues that Trump promised to protect on the campaign trail Medicare and Social Security and really stayed focused on those economic issues versus the cultural issues that's a warning sign for all Republicans that this Trump working-class support is in fact shallow and the fact that sorry George is gonna say the fact that Connor land was not Nancy Pelosi which is what we said yesterday does not make him Donald Trump he supports the Second Amendment he owns an ar-15 but he believes it ought to be a lot more difficult to get one expand background check which is popular with Republicans as well it's popular with the NRA it's a common-sense position he's personally against abortion but he supports the Supreme Court rulings on it he's against a ban that the 20-week abortion all these things so what were the point we were making yesterday is he was in line with his district because he was not all the way to the left with Nancy Pelosi and some of the other Democrats but that fact does not make him Donald Trump he was not in fact in line with Donald Trump's view of the world yeah he wasn't and Bob I'm wondering and I've been asking the question actually to myself all day yesterday and then we've been talking about it this morning any evidence that there are any Republicans on Capitol Hill who see this massive political trainwreck coming that are willing to do anything about it and start separating themselves from the most toxic parts of trumpism you're already starting to see the ramifications of what happened in southwestern Pennsylvania just go across the state to the Philadelphia suburbs and you see Ryan Costello a young Republican moderate Republican there he's now considering perhaps retiring he has not made a decision he's a rising star inside of the House GOP if you see someone like a Ryan Costello in Philadelphia area decide not to run for re-election now in the wake of what happened in the Pittsburgh suburbs that's a sign that Republicans just don't feel the tax cuts enough or president Trump's enough to help them win I think I think most people Jonathan that are looking at Ryan Costello race and the the suburbs of Philly think he's in big trouble yeah let me suggest the polling suggests that he is and that's such a key that was such a key part of the country in 2016 where Trump did all right in those Philadelphia suburbs that were seen as so important to him winning Pennsylvania Pennsylvania obviously a really important piece of electoral map for Republicans and when they had not won for a long time but he was able to swing the white house though is is certainly not suggesting that they're going to take their foot off the gas here then Trump is trying to make this midterms sort of about Trump the political office is planning to have a very aggressive schedule out there they the Trump wants to be out there holding rallies across the country you know it tied to these midterms but the question will be will those rallies actually be about the Republican gresham candidates now or will they be that Donald Trump the one that we saw last weekend at Pennsylvania was all about Donald Trump also look at the one in Pensacola mica that was supposed to be about ruling more it was all about Donald Trump well that's pattern that's the pattern that we see over time real quick but I just want to say one thing from the Democratic side and from what I'm hearing into the Democratic sit you know it's not going to necessarily the Democrats can't let the can sit back it's not going to be necessary a smooth slide went to a majority and the things they particularly have to worry about are things like primaries Connor Lamb did not have a primary because it was a special election and so they were able to pick a moderate candidate when you look around the country district after district there are five six seven Democrats in these primaries doing two things bashing each other's brains out and spending a lot of money and running the risk so they don't nominate moderates they nominate someone further to the left of the party and so I think Democrats need to focus a bit on this and try to make sure they got it right Slater as we heard that's a real problem in California they have jungle primaries there's a possibility you have the top two there's a possibility that Democrats white beats on the route and and you have a Republican they landed on a smart candidate here in pent in this district in Pennsylvania right they need to find a big Illinois in Illinois this is sitting Democrat being primary in Boston is a sitting democratically in crime right Dianne Feinstein is being primary from the left you know Democrats have to be careful amended thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch
