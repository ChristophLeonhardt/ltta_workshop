I view the word conservative as derivative of the word conserve we want to conserve our money we want to conserve our wealth we want to conserve we want to be smart we want to be smart where we go where we spend how we spend we want to conserve our country Donald Trump there during the 2016 campaign and what it means to him to be a conservative with us now we have columnist and deputy editorial page editor at The Washington Post Ruth Marcus and professor at the u.s. Naval War College and author of the book the death of expertise Tom Nichols joins us and Tom let's start by reading from your new piece in the Atlantic on why you are leaving the Republican Party in the wake of Judge Cavanaugh's confirmation you write in part quote unlike senator Susan Collins who took pages upon pages of text on national television to tell us something we already knew I will cut right to the chase I'm out of the Republican Party they have become all about winning winning means not losing and so instead of acting like a co-equal branch of government responsible for advice and consent congressional Republicans now act like a parliamentary party facing the constant threat of a vote of no-confidence so I'm out the Trump errs and the hucksters and the consultants and the hangers-on like a colony of bees who exist only to sting and die have swarmed together in a dangerous but suicidal cloud and when that mindless high finally extinguishes itself in a blaze of venom there will be nothing left Tom thank you so much for being with us I wanted you to be on after I noticed that I had retweeted you about 14 times afternoon and soon after I did I've been of course the punchline came and that was that you were leaving the Republican Party but I thought one of your most interesting and important points is that the Republican Party became what they hated and that is that is a group of people that wanted to achieve by judicial Fiat that which they couldn't achieve at the voting booth yeah it's really remarkable the way that the Republicans and the Democrats have kind of switched roles here and that the Republicans now act like they're an embattled cultural minority that is constantly on the verge of extinction and that therefore they have so little faith in their own ideas and so little faith in their ability to achieve what they want through legislation that their entire rationale for being has been to just the engage in the raw exercise of power to put judges in places unelected judges remember Republicans used to complain all the time about unelected judges to carry forward their agenda even long after after they're gone and of course the judicial Fiat that they want achieved would be of course the overturning of roe v wade something that over 60% of Americans oppose and yet that's at the end of the day at least on Twitter with a lot of conservative activists that's what this fight has been primarily about getting the fifth judge on the court to do something that six and ten Americans oppose I think and I should add that I don't represent any views but my own here is certainly not any more college or anybody else I think that the rationalization about judges and roe v wade is a way that Republicans have rationalized lives of immense political hypocrisy that as long as they're focused on getting that judge that that they will at least claim will overturn roe v wade they are claiming that they are engaged in a project so important that it excuses all other sins whether it's Donald Trump's character or high tariffs or caving to Russia or whatever it is that if pushed against the wall they say yes all those things are true but I'm doing it too because of the future of unborn children and that excuses everything and I think that that I'm not sure I believe that in the sincerity of a lot of the folks who say that I think a lot of people really do believe that but I also think it's because at this point that's all they're left with is to say I'm gonna get a judge that's gonna do these things and that that's why I'm accepting all this other terrible stuff could you find yourself now in the position of I was gonna say a lot of conservatives it appears to be fewer and fewer conservatives let me read another part of your piece as an aside let me say that I have no love for the Democratic Party which is torn between totalitarian instincts on one side and complete political malpractice on the other talk about picking your poison right now for so many actually real conservatives who believe in limited government there just is no good choice out there if the only choice is between the duopoly that is rural American politics since Abraham Lincoln was elected president I think this is the time for the centrists to to join forces as best they can because I think party discipline I've said many times the Republicans are acting like a parliamentary party all the way down to state legislatures and town halls and I just think that's unhealthy we're losing the whole notion of separated powers and federalism and I think that it has to stop Amica Tom you you work at the Naval War College in Rhode Island once represented by a classic eastern Republican John Chafee Marine Corps veteran staunch Republican all of his life you've made this declaration you're no longer a member of that party how many people have come up to you and said what took you so long that's really such a that's one of the things that I instantly mute on Twitter when someone says what took you so long I Republicans since 1979 you know it's to leave a party you've been a member of for 40 years is not something you take lightly and I think I finally left for good I was kind of extranged from the party after the 2012 elections but I think to leave for good really required me to say there is no future in this party there's nothing for me that when all this is over I can identify the people that I'm going to kind of gravitate to to reconstitute the party so it's not that it took a long time no party is perfect there have been thinks about the Republican Party have never liked things I've always liked but I think this is where I finally came to believe that the Republican Party just cannot recover from the compromises that it's made I mean at some point you sell your soul you don't get it back mmm well yeah that's actually Tom's point is a great one I as you know I'm optimistic I that things can always get better that this country and party and political parties can turn the corner but really who is there in the Republican Party that hasn't already sold their soul to Donald Trump just because Donald Trump is going to leave power sooner or later who do you associate yourself with Mike Pence is Mike Pence the present is is he presidential timber after he sold his soul to Donald Trump who what Senator Lindsey Graham we could go down the list and unfortunately and nobody has stood up to the absolute worst instincts and the breaching of constitutional norms of Donald Trump we asked time and time again why many of these Republicans who are so complicit don't see how this is going to end it can't end well I can't think of a positive ending Ruth Marcus justice open the door for an independent candidate where does this going because it doesn't feel like when you look at polling and you look at even the midterms in the Senate it doesn't feel like Democrats have you know an incredibly strong sturdy response to all of this in the form of a leader the the road for an independent candidate is a really uphill road look at Michael Bloomberg who has probably spent more time and money examining that road than anybody else and he seems to have concluded that if he's going to run for president it's going to be as a Democrat there is a super crowded Democratic field and how that shakes itself out is really up in the air but I do I share both Joe's optimism and his worry I have thought that our constitutional system is really resilient but the shakiest leg of the stool has been the feckless legislative branch and the absolute unwillingness of Senators and House members to stand up to President Trump and we've seen that on display and now I'm adding from my own just to kind of cheer everybody up a little bit further a new worry not about how the court is going to function internally but because the justices will manage to forget what they saw and what they in justice Cavanaugh's testimony and cooperate with him collegially but in terms of the country's perception of the court as a legitimate nonpartisan institution justice Cavanaugh talked about that himself but I really fear that he's done grave damage to that Tom it's always hard to leave your tribe and I have a question for you which is the people that I have seen leave the tribe in the Trump ear are people like you and Joe and Bill Kristol and max boot it's intellectuals writers people in the media the president is extraordinarily popular among the rank-and-file perhaps more so than any other president in years and years and years and those include voters who have voted for people like Mitt Romney and John McCain as the party changed or his Trump kind of pulled something out of the party that was there and latent or there and a minority part of the party and made it the main purpose of the party I think there was always something in the party that resented coastal elites intellectuals but that we had a larger tent we had a kind of an uneasy alliance among ourselves because I think we shared some basic values I think Trump has turned the Republican project that particularly is it as it was conceptualized under Ronald Reagan as positive here are the things we're going to achieve in two we no longer have things to achieve here are the people I'm going to punish here are the people I'm going to get even with and I think it's you know we Republicans don't like to talk about this I think but some of that radicalization happened after eight years of having Barack Obama that some of this is just I think racial resentment it's the sense that the Information Age has produced a gap between people with education and people not just with formal education but who can manage in this 21st century economy and people who can't and so I think that it's a combination of things there was always a latent racial tension there was always a racial latent class tension and a difficulty of dealing with again the you know the elites the intellectuals and so on Trump really took that and ran and said everybody is against you he really and this is one of the reasons I left the one thing that I think made Republicans and conservatives different from liberals in the 70s in the 80s we were the party of optimism we didn't think of ourselves as victims now we are the party of eternal victimhood Trump supporters are constantly complaining about how they're looked down upon and they're forgotten and nobody loves them enough and I find that just amazing for people who control all the branches of government well another sign of the times here president Trump is apparently using opposition to separating migrant children from their parents at the southern border to attack the Democrats at a campaign rally on Saturday night in Kansas the president repeated several of his usual falsehoods and exaggerations along with adding this every single Democrat in the US Senate has signed up for the open borders and it's a bill it's called the open borders bill what's going on and it's written by Guess Who Dianne Feinstein there's no build by that name Iike this just doesn't exist there's no bill by that megabat up and if you're in the audience you have to be asking yourself why does Donald Trump think I am so stupid why does Donald Trump play me for a fool why does Donald Trump thinks that I'm such an idiot that I can't I feel I I know that some of those people mica and that Kansas audience have to be angry at Donald Trump or him thinking they are so stupid that they are such bumpkins that they are such fools that they can't just Ruth that they can't just go on Google I know this morning they have to be deeply deeply disappointed that the president was just why usually stay that way and use them as punch line they didn't sound all that disappointed and you know every time you think we've reached a new low President Trump goes a little further but this was just an extraordinary amount of blatant dishonesty in the service of nativist ugliness and so the combination of those two threads is such a illustration of where the Republican Party has gone I've not a member of either party haven't been for a long time but you have to i hear the anguish in the voices of all of my Republican and former Republican friends who remain conservatives and believe that conserving is you know limited government and changing slowly and then to why and an openness to sunny Reaganesque vision of america and then to hear the president pull stunts like this is just sickening I mean the lie and and you even see it you see it all over the place some people that I've known and you've known me for a long time and known that basically am boring I've written three books they all say the same thing they're all attacks on big government republicanism 2004 2009 2013 when it comes to bloated bloated budgets and I mean I'm a one-trick pony and there are a few people out there like that still but they seem to be fading by the day Tom Nichols thank you so much for being on the show thank you Tom it's great
