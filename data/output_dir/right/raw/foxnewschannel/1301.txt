1
00:00:10,983 --> 00:00:12,618
>> IF THE FBI WAS SO CONCERNED

2
00:00:12,618 --> 00:00:16,187
AND IF THEY WEREN'T TARGETING

3
00:00:16,187 --> 00:00:18,223
TRUMP, THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD

4
00:00:18,223 --> 00:00:18,523
TRUMP.

5
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:20,292
IF THEY'RE REALLY CONCERNED

6
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:23,629
ABOUT THE RUSSIANS INFILTRATING

7
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:27,499
A CAMPAIGN, THEN WHY NOT TRY TO

8
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:28,867
STOP IT?

9
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:30,903
WHY NOT TELL TRUMP?

10
00:00:30,903 --> 00:00:33,305
WELL, THE ANSWER IS PERFECTLY

11
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:33,639
CLEAR.

12
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:36,875
TO ME, THEY WERE RUNNING THIS

13
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,878
WHOLE STORY.

14
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:41,280
THEY WERE PUSHING THIS SCAM.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,518
>> GREAT INSIGHT.

16
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:51,957
RUSH LIMBAUGH SAYS THEY SHOULD

17
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:53,258
HAVE WARNED THE CAMPAIGN.

18
00:00:53,258 --> 00:00:54,826
RUDY GULIANI SAYS TWO THINGS.

19
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:56,094
CARTER PAGE ON THIS SHOW LAST

20
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:58,830
NIGHT, MR. MAYOR, THIS WAS THE

21
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,999
SPRING OF 2016.

22
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:03,602
HE'S NEVER MET DONALD TRUMP.

23
00:01:03,602 --> 00:01:05,304
COMEY'S NOTES, THE SINGLE

24
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:06,872
BIGGEST UNREPORTED PART OF IT,

25
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:10,008
TRUMP SAYING TO COMEY, HEY, I

26
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:11,310
DIDN'T COLLUDE WITH RUSSIA.

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,313
IF ANYBODY DID, I WANT TO GET TO

28
00:01:14,313 --> 00:01:15,981
THE TRUTH.

29
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:16,581
REACTION.

30
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:18,684
>> WELL, THE FACT IS THAT THIS

31
00:01:18,684 --> 00:01:19,584
INVESTIGATION NEVER SHOULD HAVE

32
00:01:19,584 --> 00:01:21,820
TAKEN PLACE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

33
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,388
IF WE CONSIDER THE COUNTER

34
00:01:23,388 --> 00:01:26,158
INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION, THE

35
00:01:26,158 --> 00:01:30,028
SPYING, THE SPYGATE, ALL

36
00:01:30,028 --> 00:01:32,464
APPROPRIATE DESCRIPTIONS.

37
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:34,032
HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.

38
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:38,070
I WANT TO SEE THE DOCUMENTS THAT

39
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,304
TREY GOWDY HAS NEVER SEEN.

40
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:40,872
I WON'T LET MY CLIENT TESTIFY,

41
00:01:40,872 --> 00:01:41,740
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

42
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,041
STATES, EVEN IF HE WANTS TO,

43
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,077
WITHOUT THOSE DOCUMENTS BEING

44
00:01:45,077 --> 00:01:46,812
PRODUCED AND MYSELF AND JAY

45
00:01:46,812 --> 00:01:48,280
SEKULOW AND JANE AND MARTY.

46
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,750
WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER IT WITH A

47
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,651
FINE TOOTH COMB.

48
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:53,986
EVEN AND WHEN WE FIND THAT THIS

49
00:01:53,986 --> 00:01:56,655
WAS HANDLED APPROPRIATELY AND

50
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:57,990
THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE ON WHICH

51
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,492
THEY CAN BASE THIS PHONY

52
00:02:00,492 --> 00:02:01,727
INVESTIGATION WILL WE HAVE HIM

53
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:02,094
TESTIFY.

54
00:02:02,094 --> 00:02:04,796
IF THERE IS NO EVIDENCE, WHICH I

55
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:07,399
ASSUME THERE IS NO EVIDENCE,

56
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:09,735
THEN I MEAN, HE SHOULDN'T

57
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:10,102
TESTIFY.

58
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:11,970
THE WHOLE THING SHOULD BE

59
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,337
SQUASHED.

60
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:14,973
SHOULD BE ENDED IMMEDIATELY.

61
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:18,010
AND WE'LL CHALLENGE MUELLER TO

62
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,412
WRITE WHATEVER YOU GOT, TAKE

63
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:23,048
YOUR BEST PUNCH WITH YOUR 13

64
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:24,549
DEMOCRATS THERE, YOU COULDN'T

65
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:25,884
FIND A REPUBLICAN.

66
00:02:25,884 --> 00:02:27,052
>> Sean: ANDREW WISEMAN.

67
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:28,620
>> HOW ABOUT AN INDEPENDENT?

68
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,255
HOW ABOUT GUYS WITH ETHICAL

69
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:31,556
ISSUES AT THE JUSTICE

70
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:31,957
DEPARTMENT.

71
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:32,824
I KNOW THAT.

72
00:02:32,824 --> 00:02:34,993
I WAS A HIGH-RANKED OFFICIAL IN

73
00:02:34,993 --> 00:02:36,561
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

74
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:38,997
SO YOU HAVE A GROUP THERE, A

75
00:02:38,997 --> 00:02:40,565
LYNCHING MOB, SO LET THEM DO

76
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:42,534
THEIR JOB AND WE'RE READY TO

77
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:44,636
KNOCK THE HECK OUT OF YOU WITH

78
00:02:44,636 --> 00:02:47,172
OUR REPORT, WHICH WILL BE

79
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:49,174
AUTHORITATIVE, BACKED UP, BACKED

80
00:02:49,174 --> 00:02:51,043
UP WITH LAW AND FACTS.

81
00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:52,811
WE'LL LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

82
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:53,378
DECIDE THIS.

83
00:02:53,378 --> 00:02:55,947
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE HAVE

84
00:02:55,947 --> 00:02:58,917
CRITICIZED MY STRATEGY, WHICH IS

85
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:02,554
THE PRESIDENT'S, TO SOME EXTEND

86
00:03:02,554 --> 00:03:03,422
PLAYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

87
00:03:03,422 --> 00:03:05,457
IF THIS WERE A REGULAR CASE, I

88
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:06,725
WOULDN'T BE DOING IT.

89
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:09,327
THE PEOPLE THAT WILL DECIDE THIS

90
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:10,962
IS ARE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED

91
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:12,297
STATES IN THE ELECTION.

92
00:03:12,297 --> 00:03:13,532
THEY'RE SWITCHING FAST AND THE

93
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:15,634
DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING FOR COVER.

94
00:03:15,634 --> 00:03:17,702
YOU DON'T HEAR IMPEACHMENT

95
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:18,036
ANYMORE.

96
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:22,641
I CHALLENGE MAXINE WATERS TO SAY

97
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:23,108
IMPEACH IT.

98
00:03:23,108 --> 00:03:24,509
SAY IT.

99
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:26,545
YOU'RE GOING TO GO DOWN.

100
00:03:26,545 --> 00:03:28,547
THEY VOTE FOR YOU, I DON'T KNOW

101
00:03:28,547 --> 00:03:29,915
WHY BUT THEY VOTE FOR YOU.

102
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:31,383
YOUR COLLEAGUES WILL GO DOWN,

103
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:33,051
THIS IS THE CHANGE THAT WE

104
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:34,586
BROUGHT ABOUT BY ENGAGING AND

105
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:38,390
NOT LETTING THEM GET AWAY WITH

106
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,594
THE UNETHICAL BEHAVIORS THAT HAS

107
00:03:42,594 --> 00:03:45,697
OUTRAGED JUDGE ELLIS, JUDGE

108
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:45,997
WOOD.

109
00:03:45,997 --> 00:03:49,267
SHE THREW AWAY THE LEFT WING

110
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,336
STAR FROM MSN AND NBC OUT OF

111
00:03:51,336 --> 00:03:51,636
COURT.

112
00:03:51,636 --> 00:03:53,905
HE DOESN'T BELONG IN A NEW YORK

113
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:54,206
COURT.

114
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:55,674
HE'S NOT ETHICAL ENOUGH.

115
00:03:55,674 --> 00:03:56,475
YOU KNOW WHY?

116
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:57,742
HE'S A BIG LIAR.

117
00:03:57,742 --> 00:03:59,344
HE WANTED TO DEBATE ME.

118
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:00,112
LIKE HECK.

119
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:04,149
HE SHOULD GO DEBATE IN SOME GIN

120
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,449
MILL.

121
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:07,819
>> Sean: YOU SAID IT EARLIER AND

122
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:08,820
CONFIRMING TONIGHT THAT IF

123
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,355
MR. MUELLER SUBPOENAS THE

124
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:12,357
PRESIDENT, WE WILL FIGHT THIS TO

125
00:04:12,357 --> 00:04:12,958
THE SUPREME COURT.

126
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,060
THE CONSTITUTION IS ON THE

127
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,827
PRESIDENT'S SIDE.

128
00:04:15,827 --> 00:04:19,397
JUDGE ELLIS' COMMENTS, GOING

129
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:24,703
BACK TO 2005 TAX CASE WITH

130
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:24,920
UKRAINE

131
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,570
UKRAIN

132
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,404
UKRAINE, PAUL MANAFORT TO PUT

133
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:30,142
THE SCREWS TO THE PRESIDENT SO

134
00:04:30,142 --> 00:04:31,910
MANAFORT SINGS OR COMPOSES, AND

135
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,812
THE HOPES THAT THEY CAN

136
00:04:33,812 --> 00:04:35,614
PROSECUTE OR IMPEACH THE

137
00:04:35,614 --> 00:04:36,014
PRESIDENT.

138
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:37,983
>> SEAN, I HAVE NO FEAR OF IT,

139
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:39,084
NOR DOES THE PRESIDENT.

140
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:40,418
THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE NOTHING

141
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:40,752
WRONG.

142
00:04:40,752 --> 00:04:43,488
READ MY LIPS, NOTHING WRONG.

143
00:04:43,488 --> 00:04:45,457
SO THEY CAN -- NONE OF THESE

144
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:46,892
PEOPLE, MANAFORT, COHEN, THEY'RE

145
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:48,760
NOT GOING TO LIE.

146
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,662
THEY CAN GO POUND SOUND.

147
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:52,364
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LIE.

148
00:04:52,364 --> 00:04:54,299
>> Sean: WHAT ABOUT THE SPYING

149
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:57,836
AND THE FISA COURT ABUSE?

150
00:04:57,836 --> 00:04:59,604
>> YOU HAVE TO GO TO JAIL FOR

151
00:04:59,604 --> 00:04:59,905
THAT.

152
00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:01,706
IT'S ONE THING TO LIE EVEN IN A

153
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:02,407
CRIMINAL CASE.

154
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:05,076
ANOTHER THING TO LIE IN A

155
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:07,212
COUNTER INTELLIGENCE PROBE.

156
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:09,614
ALSO, THE FISA JUDGES RELY EVEN

157
00:05:09,614 --> 00:05:12,651
MORE THAN A CRIMINAL COURT --

158
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:16,488
>> Sean: ROD ROSENSTEIN SIGNED

159
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:18,390
THE FINAL APPLICATION.

160
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,492
SALLY YATES SIGNED ONE.

161
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:21,726
>> SO WHAT?

162
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:22,761
SO WHAT?

163
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:24,963
>> Sean: THE BULK OF IT WAS

164
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:27,032
HILLARY CLINTON BOUGHT AND PAID

165
00:05:27,032 --> 00:05:28,166
FOR, FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE BIT

166
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,569
RUSSIAN LIES AND THEY NEVER

167
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:31,136
CORROBORATED IT.

168
00:05:31,136 --> 00:05:33,805
>> I'LL FOLLOW UP ON WHAT RUSH

169
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:34,105
SAID.

170
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:35,740
OF COURSE IF IT WASN'T SPYING,

171
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,175
THEY SHOULD HAVE COME TO THE

172
00:05:37,175 --> 00:05:37,876
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

173
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:39,578
THEY COULD HAVE COME TO ME.

174
00:05:39,578 --> 00:05:40,912
I WAS THE FBI MAN OF THE YEAR

175
00:05:40,912 --> 00:05:41,680
THAT YEAR.

176
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,081
THEY COULD HAVE COME TO ME AND

177
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:45,317
THEY COULD HAVE TOLD ME AND I

178
00:05:45,317 --> 00:05:46,384
COULD HAVE BRIEFED THE PRESIDENT

179
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:48,520
OR THEY COULD HAVE BRIEFED THE

180
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:48,887
PRESIDENT.

181
00:05:48,887 --> 00:05:50,255
>> Sean: THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN

182
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:52,591
THE SPRING OF 2016.

183
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:54,392
THE PRESIDENT NEVER MET CARTER

184
00:05:54,392 --> 00:05:56,094
PAGE, EVER TO THIS DAY.

185
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:58,363
>> HE HASN'T MET MOST OF THESE

186
00:05:58,363 --> 00:06:00,966
PEOPLE THAT THEY ALLEGED -- AND

187
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:02,500
THEY HAVEN'T ALLEGED COLLUSION

188
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,735
ON THE PART OF ANYBODY.

189
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:05,437
THE EVEN RUSSIANS, THE PHONY
