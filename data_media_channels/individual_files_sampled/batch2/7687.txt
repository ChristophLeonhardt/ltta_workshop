the city of Baltimore has dropped dozens of drug-related cases after it was revealed that one cop was caught through his body cam footage planting drugs as evidence with one defendant now it turns out that there is another video showing different cops in what appears to be a case where they are again planting drugs now in this case it has to do with a vehicle that was stopped after cops pulled this individual over they searched the car and they didn't find any drugs then they turned off their body cam turned it back on searched in the exact same area of the car and then miraculously found drugs as a result in the case against that defendant has been dropped her name is Samir Collins but I do want to show you guys the video so you can kind of judge for yourselves and then I'll tell you how the police commissioner is sticking up for these cops which is unbelievable so let's look at the first video this is where they're searching the car and and it seems like they're having a hard time finding there anything okay yeah we got nothing so far okay so at that point they turn off the body cam and then here is the second video anyone I knew it that's my talking about freaking it out the weed spell okay so here's my favorite parts of that it's a terrible story but it the way they did it was almost amusing they're like so they turn on the body camera and then they plant it and then I like how they're like just standing around goes oh did anybody check this part and he finds it at me and he's like oh oh there it is no oh we were right all along come on man what you guys are wearing body cams but here's the thing I think some cops not all some cops are emboldened by the fact that a lot of police officers get away with a lot of really bad things like yeah wearing a body cam who cares if I'm wearing a body cams like I'm gonna face any consequences if I get caught or if anyone suspects that I'm planting this evidence so look here's the thing because of you know the two separate cases that we've told you about on this show you know these cops have been involved in a bunch of other cases and any other case that they haven't been involved in has to be dropped because the credibility of these police officers is now up in the air and just to give you a more broad perspective of what's going on in Baltimore last summer the US Department of Justice issued a scathing report in which investigators said the police department engaged in widespread discriminatory and unconstitutional policing practices particularly in poor predominantly black neighborhoods the city and the Justice Department later entered into a consent decree that mandates reforms and is in its early stages now look the the planting of drugs is horrible but to make matters worse the police commissioner is completely defending these actions which is frustrating to say the least he had a press conference just yesterday where he addressed these videos and here's what he had to say his name is Kevin Davis in both of these cases it's no doubt that drugs were discovered and the recovery of those drugs were captured on body-worn cameras there is no doubt that that took in either case there is no doubt that probable cause existed for arrest he's claiming that they need to do an investigation to figure out whether or not the cops were just simply re-enacting them finding the drug yeah sure that's what's happened so he's making an argument that maybe they forgot to turn on their body cameras and then they discovered the drugs with the cameras off and then they're like oh wait we want to make sure we catch this on camera so let's reenact it except we have video of them before they found any drugs where the body cameras on so they have actively turn it off okay these are the most nonsense excuses you you'll ever hear so look what you know give you a perspective you might not if you're a progressive you might not know this perspective and if you're a conservative I hear you I I was you okay so let me just explain for folks I grew up in a nice suburb I was super lucky and we never we didn't generally didn't have problems with the cops and then we thought the cops were there to protect us so I grew up thinking that cops don't lie and there's a huge and if you're progressive and you're or you're black or you're poor you might find that laughable right but there's a huge chunk of the country who thinks and was raised to believe cops don't lie and cops don't make up stuff and why would a cop plant drugs I remember having an argument with steve-o now like thirty years ago and I would and he told the story about hey his friends had drugs planted I'm like why would the cops do that that doesn't make any sense why would they want to get into trouble and ya know you gotta trust the cops until you find out the evidence now it's not to say that all cops are bad they're all planning drugs of course not but but by the way if you have cops who are doing this you should we dem out sorry for the pun okay and get them off the force otherwise you all lose credibility and yes if you've been taught to believe that cops never lie wakey-wakey right course they lie sometimes some of the cops do lie some of the times that's why we have a justice system we don't just trust them exactly and and you know just to again make a broader point about what's going on in Baltimore police have sustained 14 administrative misconduct cases against officers based on body cam footage and that's according to Davis the guy who wants to protect these cops one officers was indicted on criminal assault charges based on body camera footage so look body cams are working to some extent and I guess that's a good thing finally you know there there have been some consequences for cops who are behaving poorly and not doing their jobs in a responsible way but just to go back to your point about how some cops do lie a story that you know we didn't get to today was about a San Diego police officer who gave a citation to a man that he was accusing of sleeping in the bed of his truck which is illegal right his body cam footage showed that he actually just came up to the guy as he was walking out of a public restroom he was just completely lying about it and so if you're wondering why be generally laziness and some places have quotas and you got to make a number of arrests and so like well if I don't have something you're guilty of I got to make sure that I don't get in trouble down at headquarters so I'm gonna arrest some people anyway and Who am I gonna arrest the powerless so they don't mess with me if I arrest the powerful then I'm gonna have consequences especially if I'm lying or planting drugs on them and a lot of the powerless whether they're poor African American even middle class now some a lot of folks can't afford lawyers can't afford to fight back those are the guys you pick on right and that's how it happens if you like this video you
